So, now we have a right to come before him through the blood of Calvary. What a privilege. It might be the only right we can exercise is based on what he's done for us to come before him as children. Amen. Through the blood of the lamb. Amen. We're going to go to prayer at this time. Amen. Brother Darren Hoffman, can I ask you to come please if you wouldn't mind and open the service for us in a word of prayer. Floren family is just asking we please remember brother Roy who's home not well asking for a healing touch for him. And also our sister Patty Pettingale is asking for healing. She's having medical problems. Our sister Violet Law is asking for prayer for her sister Rosemary who has had some tests done and they're just asking that the tests would all come back positive, that everything is working in her favor and she will not have to have an operation. Amen. Let's remember our sister Violet sister. If there's something on your heart that you just like to lift before the Lord and we can come before him this morning through the blood of the lamb knowing that he's already made a way for us. All right. So, let's exercise our right this morning as sons and daughters of God. Amen. And ask for what you have need of this morning. Brother Darren, come please. Thank you. [Music] Let's bow our heads. [Music] Heavenly Father, we are so thankful this morning, Lord. Father, we're thankful for the revelation of Jesus Christ that you have given to each one of us, Lord. Lord, so many precious promises that you have placed in your word for us. So many treasures, dear God. So many promises of healing, Lord. He promises of salvation. Heavenly Father, you have given us, Lord Jesus. We're a blessed people, Lord. And father, thinking of how that when Moses met you, Lord, how that you spoke to him and said you were merciful and gracious and how he he acted upon it, Father. He stood in their breach, Lord. He prayed for the Israel, Lord. He besought you, Lord God, to be merciful unto them, to be gracious unto them and to lead them into that promised land. Lord, this morning we go through many trials and many struggles, dear God, but Lord, we're asking the same thing. Lord, lead us to that promised land. Lead our children, lead our loved ones, dear God. Heavenly Father, we we want to walk in the promises of God. They're yay and amen to them that believe. We don't want to be hearers only, Lord, but we want to hear the word. We want to recognize that is God speaking to us through the vessel. God unveiled in a man. God unveiled in a people. Lord Jesus, would you so speak to us today, Lord, through your servant, Lord? It just takes one word, Father. It just takes a moment, dear God, for that word to touch our hearts, to transform us, Lord, to change situations, to change lives, to raise up those that are sick and bodied, Lord. those that are downcast, those that are troubled in their spirits, Lord. Those that are are possessed, Lord, those that are oppressed by the enemy, Father, it is but one word, dear God, if we can just act upon it, recognizing that is Jesus Christ, the word that has been brought to us today, Lord, through your servant, Lord, our prophet, William Brham. We're so thankful, Lord, for a message of deliverance, a message that's real, Lord. Father, not just vain words. is not a dead letter, Father, but it's a living word, a living reality, Lord, Lord, that just beating within our hearts, Lord, for Father. So would you today, Lord, would you come and meet with us, Lord? We're wanting a greater portion. We want, Lord, a greater desire in our lives to serve you, Lord. So many distractions, Lord God, that the enemy puts before us. But there's an attraction on the mountain, Lord, that we want to behold today, Lord. Father, we came today to behold your glory to receive of you, Father. That this word would be quickened in each one of us today. Lord, we just ask for these prayer requests, Lord. These ones that need a touch in their body, Lord Jesus, by your stripes, Lord, they're already healed. You're the Lord God that heals all of our diseases. You've already given us the promises, Lord. May faith rise within our hearts to claim what is already ours, to resist the devil, and he will flee. Lord, we so give you thanksgiving. Father, just asking that you'll bless the remainder of the service. Lord, just as we just are led by Brother Ryan through the singing and through the worship, Lord, we just want our hearts prepared now to receive you, Lord Jesus. Have your way with us. Bless the offering. Bless those that can give. Father, may you multiply it. Use it for your glory, Father. Lord Jesus, we give you thanksgiving now and praise you for all things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [Music] Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats. We take up the offering. Maybe we could just sing. There is none like you. No one else can touch my heart like you do. Amen. He's so worthy. I just want to give him thanks this morning. I just feel such a a welcome atmosphere already this morning. And I'm so excited to see what God's going to do. Amen. Through the word. So, let's just prepare our hearts. We're going to turn the pulpit to our brother Tom for a moment just before brother Ed comes. But let's sing this chorus a couple times together. There is none like you, &gt;&gt; Lord. There is none like you. No one else &gt;&gt; can touch my heart like you &gt;&gt; the way that you do. And I can search for all eternity, Lord, and find there is none like you. There is none like you. &gt;&gt; There is none like you. &gt;&gt; Yes. No one else. No one else can touch my heart like you. &gt;&gt; And I can search. &gt;&gt; I can search for all eternity, Lord, and find that there is none like you. Once more, there's none like you, Lord. There is none. There is no one like you, Lord Jesus. No one else can touch my heart like you do. And I can search for all eternity, Lord, and find you. Amen. God bless you this morning. Nice to see everybody here. Looking forward to a wonderful day in the presence of the Lord. And um I've just got a couple of announcements before the pastor would come out and minister the word of God to us. Uh a couple of things we'd like to say. We're coming up to a camp time and it's a wonderful time and we're having it for our young people. Our camp is for our young people. And sometimes, like any daddy, he wants to have some special time with his own children. And those are times that maybe you get away with your family and you do something special. And you make them special. You make them feel special. And that's what we are having this camp for this winter camp. Brother Craig Bur from Lime, Ohio will be speaking. And I believe it'll be exactly what we have need of, what exactly the parents have been praying for for their young people. I believe God works at both ends. And as we have looked to the Lord over these years, and we have many times, of course, for the special speaker that will come, we just pray that God will anoint brother Craig in a special way. He's looking forward, and we're looking forward to him. So, we want uh as many as can support the camp in your prayers. And that's what we're asking for this morning, that God would move in a sovereign and and special way. And if you take and speak to the young people many times, it will point back to a certain event or a certain service. And I'm sure that that's what you would want for your own special young children in in your own family. So the services will be for the campers for February 23rd, 4th and 5th. Uh the 26th will be on this Sunday and the Sunday is open to all all that can make it across the border. We would invite you to come and it'll be our main service and um it starts at 10:30 10:30 a.m. on the US side. Now, those that are unable, of course, we have a a multicultural um assembly and different ones have maybe challenges in the immigration area and we we understand that. And so, what Brother Bisll, myself, we've been sitting down talking what can we do to make it like a service for you that can't make it across the border. Well, we're going to have the sanctuary open. We're going to stream it on the on the screen behind here. And uh brother I've asked brother Tim Dodd to stay behind to be with you. Brother Joe Waldner has graciously accepted also as a deacon. We'll be here. It will be a service. It will be conducted as a service, but we'll be together. We'll be at Mount Baker Bible Way Camp. You'll be at Cloverdale Bible Way. And I I believe that'll be something special for you. And you can and and you can experience what the Holy Spirit will be ministering to us in a very special way. Um counselors, we'd like you to note that we have a a meeting right away after the service in the chapel. If you could gather for that, that would be wonderful. Right away after the service, uh you may linger as as as the Lord would have you linger, but after God's dealt with you, please um assemble in the in the chapel. One last thing, um we actually spoke a couple of weeks ago that the saints or the young people from China were going to give their Wednesday night experience. Well, Brother Murphy comes in tomorrow night and they've been they've told me that they wanted Brother Murphy to be here for that evening. So, God willing, I've spoken to Brother Murphy last week and Brother Murphy is going to be taking the service Wednesday night with the young people, Brother Kim, and all those that have been in China. I think it'll be a wonderful time. So, God bless you and may this week be a just a wonderful experience. We've been waiting on the Lord for this service this morning. Brother Ed sent a uh an email through for us to do our our reading in the scripture listening to a tape. I'm looking forward to the presence of God to unveil himself through us this morning. God bless you. And there also will be a meal at the camp for everyone who makes it to the service. Uh so and there's no Sunday school, but lunch will be provided at the camp for those that can make it. We're looking forward to it. And another announcement, we do have the Canadian tax receipts will be available for pickup in the church office between services. Any receipts not collected today will be mailed. Amen. And of course, we just want to welcome everyone that is visiting with us. I had a special note that uh all the way from Grand Prairie, Sister Sukir is here. Amen. God bless you. Nice to have you with us this morning. Maybe we've heard testimonies about you. It's nice to see you in person. Welcome to the service this morning. God bless you. Amen. Anyone else is visiting. We just trust you feel welcome in the service this morning. Amen. We're going to invite our pastor to come. Why don't we sing Christ the transforming light touches this heart of mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Piercing the darkest night. I love the words of this song. Oh to reflect his grace. Let's sing this together. Oh Christ the transforming life. Oh he touches this heart of mine. He's piercing the darkness and making his glory shine. Oh, to reflect his grace, causing the world to see. Love that will go till others shall grow. Jesus revealed in me. Oh, Lord, I pray my heart, my love, my strength, my will. Lord, cleanse me in every heart and with all my spirit. Oh, to reflect his grace is causing the world to see.

Triumph and peace. tri is now Jesus reign with [Music] joy and victory over sin called to reflect his grace [Music] causing the world to see. Love that will glow till others shall go Jesus. And we're going to sing that last verse again as our pastor comes. I want you to sing it like the confession that it is. Triumph and peace is mine now. Jesus reigns within. Hallelujah. He giveth joy divine and victory over sin. So let's sing this together again and you know let's process these words as we sing them and they're powerful. Amen brother Ben.

Thank you for receiving the note yesterday and thank you Matthew for Matthew Adell sending it out. He said that's the first time that that's been requested. So that's right. It was the first time we requested it from the office and I'm glad I'm sure that none of you who have read the message the unveiling of God have regretted that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know it's a just a wonderful message and thank you brother Hayes, brother Jim Hayes and Sister Joy. Thank you for being present today and for the note also. they received the note and so I'm glad that so many uh participated and were hearing it and so on. I think that there are some things that I've been about uh 3 weeks and I haven't quite got through yet. I've got the last few pages to do which I expect to do today. But uh I've been I just got hung up so many times &gt;&gt; and there's lots to get hung up in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I want to take my my time today, but I I did want to say thank you to the people that have come and the local congregation because if we didn't have that, uh we wouldn't have much of a ministry to the country or the world or the local congregation. But we're so thankful that God has uh been able to use this place as a lighthouse. And uh to all those that are streaming and brother Timothy Anoco in South Africa uh we're missing you today. Uh I know that the people in Switzerland and Germany and Romania and Croatia and wherever else. It's just wonderful. And we we're more than thankful. We feel it a privilege to be able to be a blessing. And if we can fit someplace in their lives, then we just feel rewarded. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'm going to have you uh stand and read with me and we'll uh we'll start in the scriptures. We're going to read. I want to read John 1 and 14 first. And then we will go immediately to Philippians the 2 chapter starting to read at verse 5 in the Philippians. But first John 1 and14. And I'm reading these scriptures specifically to emphasize certain words and certain phrases throughout the service. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory. The glory is the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth. And I have been pondering very deeply and the word was made flesh. How how was it made? How did it go from the thought and the intent of God to a vis visible man? It's hard sometimes for our human minds to get around that that you know the word was made flesh. So, I've been pondering that and I want to call the service this morning the the message the making of the son of man because when we get uh the concept and the idea and into how God made that then we'll know why he made us why he made and he brought Jesus uh at a certain moment in time he brought him here. He was making him and the prophet says Christ was in Abraham and we know Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and Joseph were the four corners of the masterpiece and he constructed his masterpiece. But these were all humans with flaws &gt;&gt; just like you, &gt;&gt; just like me. We all had flaws. No one was perfect in someone else's eyes &gt;&gt; because the one that was looking wasn't perfect. &gt;&gt; So that's just normal. But so don't expect to see anything perfect cuz you wouldn't know it was perfect if it was perfect. &gt;&gt; We haven't got a perfect judgment to begin with. But the making of the son of man, the son of man was a perfect one. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the He was the image of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; He was the temple in which God came to dwell in. He was the veil &gt;&gt; for the invisible God. &gt;&gt; And what a high honor he has given to us &gt;&gt; to give a messenger, a prophet messenger with a word. But as Jesus was not even considered by the uh the local people to be a perfect one for they found enough error in him to hang him &gt;&gt; on a cross and to give him a most cruel death &gt;&gt; but death could not conquer him &gt;&gt; because he was beyond corruption by the word of God. His flesh will not see corruption. And death can't take a believer. &gt;&gt; Death, who is the penalty of sin, has already been dealt with. &gt;&gt; Jesus died the death. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God is trying to tell us something. God is using him. He came at a certain era in history of the world. In fact is this ministry his ministry just began to blossom after the second world war. We call it the second world war. Prophet calls it the second birth pain. &gt;&gt; And we need to talk message language. &gt;&gt; So that just blossomed 194748 just after the second birth pain. I wonder if that isn't significant. &gt;&gt; Yes it is. And I I was thinking just of my own life and uh we all have we all came but I want you to know today I am ministering to you as as from the depths of my heart that you individually you came when God wanted you on the scene. &gt;&gt; So we're not only talking about the making of the masterpiece Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the making of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I pondered some things today whether I would even say them. But one I've I've learned a few things in life. And one of them is that the the individual humans, we have difficulty. Uh that's why I read the scripture and the word was made flesh. We we rattle that off our lips all the time. But what does that mean? How how was the word? That's what I want to talk about. How was the word made flesh? And there are other things in the scripture I will be dealing with in the message in the of the mercy seat and how drastic changes of the mercy seat and we don't understand that perhaps. So I I wanted I want to dwell especially on the ministry, the prophets ministry coming to us at this time. And this was this wasn't an accident. Your mother and father and your heritage and all that business has nothing to do with that. God simply used them as tools &gt;&gt; to bring you on the scene. He wanted you here now. &gt;&gt; He wanted you to hear a certain thing. He wanted you. He wanted you. He has you ordained to be in this service today. I don't know most all of you or many of you and why you're here and all the rest of it. I can tell you you're not here by an accident. &gt;&gt; You are not here by just your own thought. Well, I think I'll go to church today. That's not it at all. God wanted you here to hear what's going to be spoken. &gt;&gt; And I want you to listen on that basis. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm here by design. &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory. We did. And as the glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. And to be made is is to come to pass. To be made is to be done or to to be fulfilled. And that's why Jesus said, "How then?" They want him to escape the suffering. How then will the scriptures be fulfilled? &gt;&gt; That was part of his own making. &gt;&gt; That was there for him. And you know that there's there's a rapture. There's a catching away. &gt;&gt; There's glorious things that are prophesied to happen in this time. And God called you here for that. &gt;&gt; That that's the that that that's the enormity of this thing. That is just un almost unbelievable. God called you here for that. And that is why Satan put such pressure on you to captivate your time, to capture your mind, to occupy you with all kinds of other things. And that's fine. We've got necessary things, but we must keep our focal point. why we're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll read now in Philippians 2, starting in verse 5. Let this mind be in you which also was in Christ which was also in Christ Jesus. Who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man. So we have that again. And he was made in the likeness of man. wasn't easy, wasn't simple. And he and God himself subjected himself and humbled himself, allowed in the character of God, allowed himself to be represented on earth by men who did things that you probably wouldn't respect. But Moses murdered a man and David took Ba Sheba and all of these things and things that you might have remembered for a whole lifetime. Wouldn't it be good for you to remember that? &gt;&gt; It would be good for you to remember that God brought this man &gt;&gt; and God anointed this man &gt;&gt; and I'm not called here to figure out what I can find wrong with them or wrong with their message or wrong with what they said. That's not my calling. I'm called here to believe &gt;&gt; what God has made known to me. &gt;&gt; And he was made in the likeness of men. Verse eight. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. And then we go on to 2 Corinthians, I'm sorry, 2 Corinthians 3 and 6. who also who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit. For the letter kleth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death written in and engraven in stones was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away, how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious hath no glory in this respect, but reason by reason of the glory that excelth. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remainth is glorious. Now that's a verse we want to remember. Although we may not have re understood some of the things we read. For if that which is done away, the law was done away and and fulfilled much more that which remainth is glorious. There is some that remains and somehow we are here. Verse 12. Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech, we use much great plainness of speech, and not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished. But their mind was blinded. For until this day, notice this phrase, for until this day remainth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ. But even unto this day, but even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart because they had an idea what he was saying. They had it all conceived, already set up, &gt;&gt; right? as they have today. Whether it be what brand you want, you can have any brand from Catholic to Orthodox to Methodist to Baptist to whatever you want. And so you say, "Well, are you different?" Yeah, we are different. We're different because uh one phrase that you will f have found in the message when God a man he says a word is a word. It just remains a word. And it's if if it's not more than a written word, then it just remains a written word. And there be all kinds of people have a different understanding of a written word. You have one education. You came from one country. You have a background. You may think of it even in another language. And and so a certain written word has a certain reference to you and you you think of it that way. But but the prophet of God would maybe give a a word or say, "Well, I heard that when I was a kid. I I heard that in other churches and so on." But then when God comes and manifests that word or makes it known or when God does something and and fulfills a certain word and unites it, merges it with time and events in time and the people and the and and maybe the customs that are happening on the street and in other churches in in homes and and he manifests that &gt;&gt; this is my word for the time &gt;&gt; then then it's gone beyond a word. Prophet says then he's manifested it &gt;&gt; and once he's shown it once God has come behind it and shown it then that's the supernatural part and by believing the supernatural part you're a different kind of a person. &gt;&gt; That's that's the difference in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, when it which is the heart shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord. Let's read that 18th verse together. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. Amen. Thank you for standing. You may be seated. Brother Brandham in the message actually had gone further and he read the next verses of chapter 4 uh of 2 Corinthians. Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, we have received mercy, we faint not, but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God, deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, there are some principles and I have been holding these things in my heart forever, ever, ever so long, and I finally decided uh I'll uh I just talked to Tom and I've been kind of waiting for the last few weeks to maybe approach this, but I wasn't ready. So, brother Tom graciously uh preached the word and and we were very much blessed and others also. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, when brother Brandham was done with this uh reading of this scripture, he he said his prayer and I want to I want to give several quotes. I put them on the screen so I will read them and you can read them. Those that read fast, don't read fast. Just ponder them along as you go. Go follow me and I'll read slow. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Are we all in agreement? &gt;&gt; All right. Good. Good. They had my clicker hidden. Could we just dim the lights a wee bit, please? Thank you. Here's the prayer. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of his word. Now, my subject this morning, I trust that God will reveal this and each time if you take the tapes and listen and I hope and trust that you have had a spiritual understanding of what that God has been in trying to get over to the church. So, I I stopped there. What What has God been trying to get over to the church? I'm silent for a moment just because that's the way I am when I read. I think, what has God been trying to get over to the church? &gt;&gt; I hope I haven't missed anything. Um, and and and getting over to the church without saying it right out. So, that puts a little question on it right there. It's a thing sometime we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down. &gt;&gt; We have to say things in such a way that it might thin down. &gt;&gt; It might bring some to go out. Wow. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Some to leave and some to ponder over. The Bible says when the angel of the Lord came to Mary Magdalene or not Mary Magdalene but Mary the Virgin Mary and said you're going to have a child and the Holy Spirit is going to overshadow you and uh that which will be conceived in you will be of the Holy Ghost. That that that's incredible. And she how how will these things be? I've not known a man. So, right away she's going into the medical side of things. I haven't received any sperm from a man. &gt;&gt; How will anything be conceived in me? But this is going to be of the Holy Ghost. The Bible says she pondered these things. &gt;&gt; So, I I felt to say, and I wrote it down, don't ponder too long. Ponder these things, but don't ponder them into till you wound them down into unbelief. Ponder them so that you can believe them. &gt;&gt; Till you finally come to the conclusion, well, I don't know how it's going to happen, but it's just going to happen because he has said this to me. &gt;&gt; But it may cause some to leave or some to ponder over. But that's done purposely. it because it must be done that way. It must be done that way. &gt;&gt; Spiritual things must be done that way. And when we go to the scripture, if you go to the teachings of Jesus and read the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, you will find that Jesus actually invited people to disbelieve. &gt;&gt; Because he knew that those that were called can't be can't disbelieve. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; He gave them a lot of room. And then when I listen to the prophets ministry, I find and I'm just saying this to you because I'm not here to try to convince you of anything. &gt;&gt; If you're a believer, you are convinced. &gt;&gt; And if you're an unbeliever, well, you are a makebeliever, you might just be trying to figure out what I'm sitting here and saying, what can I criticize? You can criticize lots of things. If you need any help, I'll help you. Then it might be I'm carrying on in the message now. Then it might be that some would say, "You mean would would that God would purposely do a thing like that?" He certainly did. &gt;&gt; And he does yet. &gt;&gt; We carry on. He said one day and I put the multitudes up there. He because he deals with three groups. He deals with multitudes, the ministerial ministerial association and and he describes the ministerial association. He goes back to the 70 that Jesus chose and he he he he just compares with things that they might do today and so on so forth. It's all the same. It's it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever and the people are the same. &gt;&gt; He said one day when there were thousands around him, he said, "Except you eat the flesh of the son of God, son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you." What kind of a statement do you think that a medical doctor or a nurse Now we read this over very quick, but allow me to stop. educated people. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Not that brother Brandham says, "I'm not supporting ignorance." &gt;&gt; He had nothing wrong with going to universities or colleges or getting as high an education as you possibly can. But you must never allow that to tinker with your faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No matter regardless of what you've learned or what someone remember when you study a book, you're just studying someone else's brain. &gt;&gt; There's no brain &gt;&gt; that equals this one. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And there's no brain that equals who this sent. &gt;&gt; If you believe on him who he has sent, Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Why do you think that a medical doctor or a nurse or any fine intellectual person is educated people? So now education is fine but you must not let it allow allow it to become a trap &gt;&gt; to you &gt;&gt; to that somehow now you've read in the book and you're going to figure things out. &gt;&gt; Hey this last week I was to a doctor. It's a young young doctor and uh my wife was with me and uh she's oriental and I find many of them very very brilliant but she had studied things in a books and she said I'm strongly suspicious that uh your heart is diseased. I'm strongly suspicious. And she says, I want you to have an angiogram and I'll arrange that and I want you to wear a patch and I and while she was saying it, I thought, I'm not having an angiogram and I'm not having a not wearing this patch and and she's writing out the uh and I was feeling sorry for her while she was writing out prescription because I'm not doing any of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Anyway, but she learned it in a book and was going to impose what she learned in a book onto me. And I've learned some other things from another book and I just I choose to read those things. And yet on the on the same hand, I respect those people very very highly. And uh but something witnesses like I think it was Charles Wesley's father that said to him on his deathbed, "It's the inner witness, son. It's the inner witness. And so I go for the inner witness while I'm sitting down with wise people and people who are educated and people who know about my body and they've studied all about the anatomy etc etc and they will say something and and I have sat before one of the finest uh uh spinal doctors in Vancouver. In fact is he's over the spinal uh division in the Vancouver General Hospital. I sat there and I had I went down to Seattle and had some pictures taken this a few years ago. And and so he asked me, "Where'd you have these pictures taken?" I said, "In Seattle." He said, "Well, they're good enough for diagnosis diagnostics, but I wouldn't operate with these. I would do my own." And so he he had them up on the screen and put them all up on the screen. I'm looking at all my bones and stuff. And he says, uh, well, he said, if you tell me that you'd like to operate, I'll operate, but if you tell me that you'd like to wait a while, I think that would be good, too. Those are his words. And I said, uh, I I think I'll wait. And he said, I think that's a good idea. He said, you know, a nerve will heal. And when he said that, It just like a resounding within me said, "God made you say that." That's just why I came here. God made you say that. And I've used that phrase dozens of times. A nerve will heal. Hallelujah. Of course, it'll heal. God made it that way. &gt;&gt; You know how many years ago that is? That's I've gone hunting and gone on the quads and did everything that everyone else does and uh I I think that's fine. So education is fine. Don't get me wrong. That's why we have a school. He says but what for a man that had a ministry like that? He said a fine intellectual person would think of a statement. What would they think of a statement like that? Drink my blood, eat my flesh. He says, "For a man that had a ministry like that, like he had, like Jesus had." Why would he say eat the flesh? That's cannibal to drink human blood. It's vampire. And furthermore, I tell you, it's absolutely opposed to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Please let that sink in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said things that were absolutely opposed to Old Testament scripture, which was the only scripture they had. &gt;&gt; And an intellectual person would say, "No wonder they would walk away." &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; You've allowed things to, you know, turn around in your mind and say, "Well, you know, that's that's not really the way it is, &gt;&gt; right? I just came up with one few days ago. Everybody, brother Brandon, whenever he refers to Na, how many have heard him refer to Nika? &gt;&gt; About eight or 10 people. How? And he says Rome. &gt;&gt; And and my wife has detected it and others and they said, "Well, Na is not in Rome. It's in Italy. It's in not Italy and Turkey." &gt;&gt; Right. Right. But when when the Constantine was over and all the rest of it, it was under Roman rule. &gt;&gt; It was under the Roman kingdom &gt;&gt; at that time. So he says, "What do you think they would say to drink human blood? It's a vampire." In other words, he wants us to be cannibals and vampires. And the whole, this was the result of it. The whole audience walked away &gt;&gt; from hell. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They were healed or they they were had all kinds of miracles happen. They ate supernatural bread &gt;&gt; that he kept multiplying to them. &gt;&gt; I was there. They could say, "I was there." But now they're walking away. &gt;&gt; So something was overpowering in their in their reasoning and the whole audience walked away. And I've just put down the scripture strictly forbade to do such things as to drink blood. &gt;&gt; Just put I want it down in language that you understand it. And then he the the next group is and there was a ministerial association. Now we've gone from number one group was the multitudes. Second group is a ministerial association that those multitudes likely listened to. And there was a ministerial association with him of 70 that he had chosen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And he turned to them and he said, "What will you think when you see the Son of Man ascending up from where he came from?" &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't explain that. &gt;&gt; He never explained how. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul did that later on. He just said it and then when his this he said, "What will you say to these ministers when you see the Son of Man ascending up from where he came from?" No doubt the men said, "Now just a moment. Oh, we eat with him. We fish with him." Don't think that I haven't included myself in this, &gt;&gt; right? We hunt with him. &gt;&gt; We sleep in the same tent. &gt;&gt; We eat. &gt;&gt; We make pancakes together. &gt;&gt; Somebody served Jesus. &gt;&gt; They the women and so on. It was we we can't have all spiritual things up here in some hooks &gt;&gt; place where we can't get it get real. &gt;&gt; It was right here. Jesus had clothes like you have clothes. Jesus washed like you washed. &gt;&gt; Jesus wept like you weep. &gt;&gt; Jesus had all of these things. And so people could see his humanity. They had to come to grips with that. When he said, "What will you say when the what will you say to these ministers and say the son of man? You see the son of man ascending up from where he came from?" No doubt. They said just a moment. We eat with him. We fish with him. We sleep with him. We know where he was born. We see the cradle that he was rocked in. And how does this man, this is a hard saying, and the Bible said that they didn't walk with him anymore. It was John 6 and 66. I looked that up for you, so you can put that down if you want. John 6 verse 66. Then he had 12 left. That's group three. Had the audience of the multitudes. And he had this is just after. Now don't forget the scripture is the unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; And the one who was saying these things was God in flesh. &gt;&gt; The one who was speaking and I will go further in in uh in and I want to show you today before I close. I want to show you that he was actually the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; He was the mercy seat. and they were walking away from the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; That's what I want you to hear. Don't ever walk away from the mercy seat cuz I'm also going to take and show you how the mercy seat moved down in stages to this present time. &gt;&gt; People think, well, I'm just leaving a message. I I'm done with that. Don't leave the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Make sure you're not walking away from the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; It's not walking away from brother this or sister that or whatever that or I'm walking away from this mistake or this error. I'm walking away. No, you you you brother Ed is saying some very very serious things. You be careful what you walk away from. and at other in other cases walk away from it very quickly and he had 12 left. This is incredible God all these people that have left and he chose he chose 12 and one of them was a devil. He said, "So he turned to them and there's no one could explain what he had just said, &gt;&gt; right? [Music] &gt;&gt; How are they going to eat his flesh and drink his blood?" And notice this next line, "And how did he come down when he was born right here on earth?" They couldn't understand it. That's number one. They couldn't understand it. And neither can you understand everything that this message has spoken for our time or anything that God may even vindicate or utter or prove that this is me. It doesn't mean that you'll understand it. &gt;&gt; You're nice and quiet. &gt;&gt; That's just exactly what I want. And furthermore, we'll go on a little further. They couldn't understand it. And then he turned to those to to the apostles and he said, "Do you want to go also? &gt;&gt; This is the Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is a mercy seat. This is the son of God. &gt;&gt; This is the holy one of Israel. Do you want to go also?" And that's when the apostle Peter made that great statement, Lord, to whom would we go? For we are satisfied. We know assuredly that you and you alone have the word of life at this hour and were satisfied of that. So they couldn't could not explain it. &gt;&gt; Why are you a believer? You don't have to really give an answer because you you if you are a believer, you can't explain it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How are you a believer? I don't know exactly how people say, "Are you that gullible?" Yeah, I guess so. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Either that or I'm just that simple or whatever more. I don't know what it is. You can't explain faith. &gt;&gt; It's something that you believe &gt;&gt; and it's so solid that there's nothing else will take its place. &gt;&gt; I can tell you the proof of this &gt;&gt; daily. Daily. You're with people. You're with your neighbors. You're with your peers. You're maybe in a a workplace. And you know as well as I know and I'm going to bear right down on you. People look at you admirably or hatefully or spitefully, whatever, but they there's a good number of people that look at you admirably. They wish they had your life. &gt;&gt; They wish they had that appearance. &gt;&gt; They wish they had that peace. &gt;&gt; They wish they had that stability. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I remember walking to a man's place up on above my wife's father's store and he had rooms up there and and uh I was in my little room and I walked over to this other fell's room. I knew him real well. His brother was a bookkeeper in the store and I walked over to him, knocked on his door and he was laying on his cot. They always called me Biscll. He said, "Biscll"? He said, "you don't know how many times I've laid on this bed weeping." and he gritted his teeth and said saying, "I wish I could live the life you live." &gt;&gt; And then he began to just opened up like he was split open. He said, "You may not know it, but he says, I'm a married man." He said, "I went to war. My wife left me." And he says, "And uh I have two two daughters." He was shocking me. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This guy was Smitty who he would just went out and hunted with. I mean, he just like blurted open everything. And I said to him, I said, he says, "And one of my daughters is coming on the train to see me." He said, "And I'm going to meet her here." He says, "I haven't seen her since I came back from war." And I says, "Uh, Smmedy," his name was Smith. I said, "I'm going to go back to my room right now. I'm going to pray that you and your wife will come together and so that your children." And I went back to my room. You talk about humility and simplicity. I'm talking about a God that works. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a God that is a living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I prayed that that somehow somehow couldn't explain it, couldn't understand it. I just heard it a few moments ago and I just prayed that somehow God would do something supernatural. And the next time I talked to him, when his wife his daughter came on the train, it was his wife instead of his daughter. and he went back to Brford, Ontario. And I saw him years later when I was in Ontario. And he he said if God would do that, he would serve God the rest of his life. Now, he would lay on that very cot and grit his teeth and say he would want to live that life. I'm telling you, there's people that want to live your life. Yes. &gt;&gt; They have a certain ambition to live their life &gt;&gt; or to get out of the mess that they're in or whatever. It's it Listen, friends, the message isn't for everybody. &gt;&gt; That's just that simple. &gt;&gt; It's not for everybody. Can I hear you say amen? &gt;&gt; But there are people that admire it and they they they love the glow. And where do you find young ladies like this? And listen, you just thank God you are who you are by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Therefore, they knew that the word that was written for that age that they were living in, the Messiah age, that he fit that place exactly. That's what they knew. They couldn't explain it. And what they could what what could they do? Uh what could they do to go back in them cold formal churches that they came out of said where would we go to? We are fully persuaded that you have the word of life. And they couldn't explain it &gt;&gt; but they believed it &gt;&gt; and I identify with that sir &gt;&gt; 100%. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they couldn't explain it. I can't explain exactly. But I can tell you all for a thousand tongues. &gt;&gt; I can tell you I I wouldn't I wouldn't take another life for anything. &gt;&gt; You can have the whole world &gt;&gt; have all their entertainment and all of their whatever they're in taken up with taken up. &gt;&gt; But give me this Jesus. And Jesus said that the reason why I didn't want to preach this, I want Jesus to take responsibility for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, you'll go from here. Or some might go from here. Or some might be streaming. Or some might be listening just for to find out what they could find wrong. And they say, "Well, this is what brother Ed Biscll said." No, this is what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; This is what a prophet of God said about what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said that to weed down his crowd &gt;&gt; till he could get the group together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What group together? There is a group till he could get a group together. &gt;&gt; You have come together. I want you to realize that who you're sitting beside came here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Maybe different purposes. I don't know. But you came here for a certain purpose. Jesus, if you had been here and Jesus was a minister, he would say things that if possible, it would weed the crew, the group down till he had their group that believed him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And out of all of those people, only 11 of them then understood exactly, now notice now, not what it was or explain what they believed, but explain they understood who he was. &gt;&gt; This is what the prophet of God is speaking. That's what the message is all about. The unveiling of God. Right? &gt;&gt; And if it was just that simple, it it wouldn't have to be explained. &gt;&gt; And it's not actually explained. That's why you could read the message book. You can read the whole New Testament. Multitudes. This is a this is a paradox to me how multitudes of people hate God, hate the gospel, hate anything to do with purity, etc. And yet when they die, they want somebody somebody to read some scripture over them or put them in heaven. &gt;&gt; They don't want to go to heaven. They'll be miserable in heaven. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. Don't forgive me. Who understood actually who he was. They knowed that he was God. and God alone. And now this is brother Brennham speaking. And now my subject this morning is to reveal or unveil that God. &gt;&gt; When you read that message, &gt;&gt; whether you got it or not, that was the purpose &gt;&gt; to unveil that God. &gt;&gt; And you may or may not have got it. You may want to go back and reread now, but this is his opening phrases. And this was the purpose of this service &gt;&gt; is to redirect you to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to go over the messages super, you know, in a light way. Um, you have to excuse me here. I'm I'm doing my very best for you to reveal or unveil that God. Now, I just have your attention for a few moments and I have a few more slides to show you in the making. The the the subject was making the making of the son of man. And I want to give it another another title at this point and that is the making of the mercy seat. You know, we're a lot of nice people here. We're friendly people. I hope we're all different natures, etc. But there's not a man or a woman. There's not a child. There's not a person that at some time in your life, you may not feel that this morning you're sitting here, you may not feel that, but believe me, there's not not a single one. But what someday will need mercy. &gt;&gt; Mercy is not something that you have. Mercy is not something you deserve. And mercy is not compassion. &gt;&gt; Mercy is not sympathy. &gt;&gt; Mercy is not forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Mercy is something you don't possess. I had a I have the quote on this, but I won't refer to it except to say the prophet of God said, "You were born here condemned." &gt;&gt; I was born condemned. We didn't come here with there are those that maybe came in royalty or those that were those that are gifted and those that are skilled and those that have incredible mental retention. You were born here condemned. &gt;&gt; Your parents were condemned. &gt;&gt; Your great grandparents were condemned. &gt;&gt; We were condemned by sin. We were born in sin and shaped in iniquity and we needed mercy. &gt;&gt; And I hope that you'll understand what I'm the way I'm presenting this. We came here condemned and we needed mercy. And the only one that can give mercy is God who has mercy. Amen. &gt;&gt; He can give mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say that so you understand it. Uh I'm not satisfied with the way it just came out. Everybody, every human that ever came into this world needs mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we we cannot look upon someone else. Someone else we we could error and do something wrong. Say I'm sorry. and they can forgive us for it. But that but that is not mercy. Mercy is something that we don't have. Mercy is something we don't deserve. We were born condemned. And God gives mercy. And mercy could be would be I will not uh I will not attribute your sin to you. Yes, &gt;&gt; you don't deserve it. But I'm not going to attribute your sin to you. &gt;&gt; You were born a natural unbeliever. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to attribute what goes through your mind to you. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to attribute your questions and doubt to you. &gt;&gt; I'm not. And that's my mercy. &gt;&gt; And that's what mercy is. Mercy isn't some fluff and flooy and well, you're a nice person. That's not mercy. When that's all done and I go home alone and lay my head upon my pillow, I need mercy. &gt;&gt; I need to know that I have contact with one who has the mercy. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's only God and God alone. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And this is going to maybe blow you away, but you know, we each I really question whether I would say this, but I think I will. It's hard for humans. I started out to to say it's hard for humans to uh recognize the kind of change and I use the scripture and the word was made flesh and it kind of loses people. I've used that scripture. These brethren have used these scriptures and you've quoted these scriptures. You've read these scriptures perhaps hundreds of times. But to to to watch how how does it evolve that the word was made flesh? I I can't really explain that, but I believe that perfectly. &gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong, but each one of you here one day were just a sperm. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's all you were. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You were a sperm within your father. And that sperm came to the womb of your mom, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's every person. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how handsome and how beautiful and all the rest of it you may be. That's what you wear. &gt;&gt; And out of that and by the design of the creator, you were born a child. and you came into the world and you grew into the person you are. But you nobody I've talked to thousands of people. I haven't talked to people who gloried you know what I was once just a sperm. &gt;&gt; They don't talk about that. They'll talk about when they were young and talked about when they were in education. They talked about when they were in the military or what what they did in life and all the rest of it, but they don't talk about, but God knew you when you were just a sperm. &gt;&gt; God knew you prior to that. &gt;&gt; And he says, "This sperm isn't going to turn out very good. So, they're going to need my mercy. &gt;&gt; They're going to need my mercy. and I've got it to give it to them. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; This isn't a wack old preacher here, but my mind does go out on strange places. And that would help you to understand that going from one thing, you evolve to another to the person you are. Yes, you're dressed very nice and your hair is done very nice and all of you're very very fine people and so you've you've come some distance, but this very fine body is going to lay on a slab &gt;&gt; and some undertaker is going to pump it full of chemicals so it doesn't rot so fast. And and this is what's going to happen. It's not going to have a very uh pompous departure. &gt;&gt; People will do the best they can. They will say the nicest things about you and hope for somebody to put you in heaven. No, you're either in heaven now or &gt;&gt; is this okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; People need to see how things evolve. And so I I want to I want to just take you very quickly and and and this is where maybe some of you will drop off, but I hope not. I hope not. And I'll just tell you ahead of time. No, I won't tell you ahead of time. No, I want to get down to the mercy seat. [Music] Can I shut the lights down please for just a moment? Now this is the mercy seat. This is the actually the ark. A picture of the ark as I got this off the internet. So that's a picture of the ark and where the two cherubams are with their uh perhaps I'll I'll just read what they say about that. Um, I guess I won't. But the two cherubams on top have their wings to toward each other and their faces are looking down. Now, I I just need a moment to This is They're covering the mercy seat, &gt;&gt; but what is covering it is is is literally a slab. &gt;&gt; Yes. And it is about 2 and 1/2 uh cubits by 1 and 1/2 cubits. 2 and 1/2 cubits long and 1 and 1/2 cubits wide. You're listening real close. The only thing in that box is the word of God. &gt;&gt; And if you think you'll get mercy anywhere else, you are mistaken. And the cherubams which represented cherubams and Isaiah were saying holy, holy, holy. That's the only word they knew. Holy, holy, holiness to the Lord. That's what God considers very holy. That was the mercy seat and the the slab which was the actual mercy seat. It's not the whole box. The slab which was the mercy seat covered the word of God or veiled the word of God and the people. You think they can explain that? And that was in the tent of their testimony. You you think that the uh you know all the Jebusites and the Canaanites and all that came up on the hill said, "What in the world is that down there in the middle of Israel?" And they're all camped around it ceremoniously. All the 12 tribes are divided into four tribes each on and they got emblems of the uh of the camps and Judah and the different ones and you know all around the camps. What in the world is that? And and then some fanatical said, well you know I had an Israelite a friend of mine and you know what he told me? He said their god is in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and they have a prophet down there. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, we're going to look like we're a lot of believers. They have a prophet down there and and their prophet the God said that that they'll meet their prophet uh in between these cherubams, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that's their religion. &gt;&gt; You think they were accepted? No. They've been even hated to this day. &gt;&gt; Sure. Hang on, I'm just started. &gt;&gt; Then that mercy seat evolved from a golden emblem such as that to this. &gt;&gt; I thought that's a beautiful picture. Jesus. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Could we dell the lights a little more, please? &gt;&gt; How are you going to figure out? &gt;&gt; How are you going to explain it? Went from that to this. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; the word. What was in the ark &gt;&gt; became flesh. &gt;&gt; And God used humans, weak humans to bring this one along because this Christ was in Moses. This Christ was in Abraham. This Christ was in all the Old Testament saints. And this Christ was in. And Jesus said himself to his disciples, to that 11 that stayed with him, I will be in you &gt;&gt; and you'll be in me &gt;&gt; and I'll be in the father &gt;&gt; and we'll be one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How? I don't care how. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to explain it. I'm here to believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to me now. And with the centuries of time, you know, raised up Catholicism and and the Orthodox Church of the Greek Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox, Ukrainian Catholic, which I came from. all of these and all of their theories and you you think things that we do are foolish. Washing feet is foolish. Jesus washed feet. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But they tried to push my head towards kissing some of the emblems and the wooden statues on a little table. I never saw Jesus kissing any statues. I didn't know I was only five or six, but I just pulled my head back. I I wasn't going to kiss those statues. You talk about a You talk about some weird things that happen. And I'll tell you that to have a I'm going to speak very plainly now, but to hear on the on this on the news and you hear on the news that this great church of hundreds of millions of people and now in and they just they just uh came out with some statistics out of Australia that 30 to 40% &gt;&gt; of their priests were involved in sexual sins. upon young people and people still go there to church. &gt;&gt; That's wild. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That's your world, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's this world. &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be separated from this world. &gt;&gt; And a lot of people want to hide their face and and and say as though they they don't want to think about that. That's the real world and that's a devil's world. And I like to have a prophet say, "And this is Satan's Eden." &gt;&gt; Why don't you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; This is Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Every government's of the devil. &gt;&gt; Every kingdoms of the devil. &gt;&gt; He's the one who said, "I'll give you the I'll if you'll bow down and worship me, I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew he was going to get them anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The reason why he's now the mercy saint and the prophet of God said certain things about this that I want you to. The veil of the temple was torn in twain from the top to the bottom because the ark which we had just seen was behind this veil. &gt;&gt; And God was not satisfied. Stay with me now. God was not satisfied that the ark which was his promise it it was the ten commandments that were in that veil behind in that ark behind this veil there wasn't one of the Israelites that could keep the ten commandments listen I'm preaching to you &gt;&gt; there isn't one of you that can keep the ten commandments &gt;&gt; and Jesus himself compounded the commandments &gt;&gt; commandments and said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." And Jesus enlarged on that and said, "If thou lookst on a woman to commit, if thou lookst on a woman to lust after her, you have committed adultery with her in your heart." Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; Is that what this Bible says? &gt;&gt; That's exactly what this Bible says. There isn't a man alive that can be justified in the face of that kind of the the law. The apostle Paul said, "The law did not come to justify. The law came to condemn." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is there is there uh now you'll have to be just very very respectful. Is there a is there value? Is there value in living right? Is there value in living pure? Is there value in living holy? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With this life, you have a better relationship. You have a you have a God-honoring relationship. &gt;&gt; God has honored those things. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't give you more righteousness, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; than a prostitute, &gt;&gt; or some sinner man? no more righteous. He's as pure as you are. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. I'm gonna preach it anyway. &gt;&gt; When it comes to redemption, when it comes to receiving mercy, if God gives Rahab mercy, &gt;&gt; that's as pure as she's as pure as the next person. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God and I can't explain that, but if God decided to give Ba Sheba uh to give her mercy &gt;&gt; and send and in a merciful state, she brought forth Solomon. &gt;&gt; And Jesus referred to Solomon. &gt;&gt; He didn't refer to any other the sons of David, but he referred to Solomon. And he says, "A greater than Solomon is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have I left you someplace? &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; But that ark was behind this veil. And the veil was the veil was torn from top to bottom. When the veil was rent at Calvary, the mercy seat came into plain view. &gt;&gt; It was hanging on Calvary, dripping in blood as they had took blood year after year at the cleansing of the sanctuary and the sprinkling of the mercy seat. The mercy seat had to be sprinkled with blood by the finger of the priest. And there God with his great mighty stroke of lightning power split the old badger veil from top to bottom. And the mercy seat came into plain view. &gt;&gt; The mercy seat came into plain view. The real genuine lamb of God was hanging in plain view on Calvary. We say amen to that. We believe that. And the mercy seat came into plain view when God had paid the price himself and become one of us and had manifested himself as a man to get acquainted with us and we to be acquainted with him. The mercy seat was in plain view of all Israel on that day of the atonement. &gt;&gt; They all could have seen it. He was in plain view. Now listen to me friends. We may look back, but God then changed this mercy seat to a a living word, but since Pentecost, since the crucifixion, when that veil was rent from top to bottom for that generation, for that generation, you weren't back there, but you are here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You weren't there. &gt;&gt; You agree with that? You weren't there. We're not worshiping history. We're not worshiping some historical god. You were not there. All right. Where's the mercy seat for you? The same word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They couldn't explain how that word was made flesh. But they believed who he was. That's what the prophets re revealing and speaking of. They believed who he was. &gt;&gt; And that's the key today. &gt;&gt; And you have to believe who God sends. Amen. &gt;&gt; God sent not only a prophet in this generation, but God stood beside him &gt;&gt; with a pillar of fire and confirmed things that we could not confirm &gt;&gt; and said things that were even hard to believe. But you better believe it. &gt;&gt; You must believe whom God sent. &gt;&gt; That's the word &gt;&gt; that he has used. And fact is friends, I'm coming to it in just a moment. That's mercy. &gt;&gt; That's the mercy seat &gt;&gt; in this generation. You might say, "Oh, that is just wild." Let it be wild. &gt;&gt; Can I explain it? No, I can't explain it. You can't explain it. &gt;&gt; And if you find fault with that, then give me the answer. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't point to a book. All right. &gt;&gt; I believe that this is the word of God. But the God of this, the God is necessary for the God of this word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The God of this word, these are words on paper, India paper. &gt;&gt; Let the God of this word, &gt;&gt; that's what the prophet of God said. That's what brother Brandham said when Charlie Mitchell was sitting there with a with a a tomb in a tumor in his lung. Is that what happened? &gt;&gt; A tumor in his lung. You can hear it on the on the tape. You can hear the voice on the tape. Then I want to say, was God with the man or not? &gt;&gt; Yes, God is with the man. &gt;&gt; You can do what you wish with it. But nevertheless, that's what happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's sitting there, a man that I know, a man I interviewed, and he's l he's there with a tumor in his lung, the size of a man's fist, and have a man speak and say, "Let the God of Elijah, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; if he is God, &gt;&gt; let him come forth now." &gt;&gt; And calls out the man. There's a man, &gt;&gt; his name's Charlie Mitchell, right? That's right. &gt;&gt; I want you to be very respectful. Now, &gt;&gt; we're talking about this God. You know, brother Benham talks about people moving and don't move if you don't need to because we all have human spirits and that is what it's it's not you physically your spirit how how that's be being treated and how it's being looked on. And just now I want to tell you God, that God, the God of Jesus Christ, who you saw hanging here on a cross, just a picture of him, the God of William Brandham, the God of the prophets, the God of Moses, and the God of your God. &gt;&gt; I say it regularly, my God, &gt;&gt; the Holy One of Israel. &gt;&gt; Do you identify with that God? Do you identify with him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what this church exists for. &gt;&gt; A living God. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm interested in this message because it's a living God. &gt;&gt; It's the only message I know that God came down &gt;&gt; and God proved his existence. &gt;&gt; God proved his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what you want to hang on to &gt;&gt; where God proved himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm standing by this man. I'm standing by this word. &gt;&gt; And Charlie Mitchell goes back to the very hospitals, three of them, the hospitals that sent him on behalf of the coal mine that he worked in. and brother Brandham if oh my goodness friends have you listened to the word the way because I knew some of these people I've listened and I'm conveying it to you allow me to do that &gt;&gt; and you can hear it with your own ears if you wish to go get the tape and listen to him call Charlie Mitchell out and he says you have been a mine worker &gt;&gt; that's like saying, "You have been a sinner, &gt;&gt; but you're not a sinner anymore. You have been an unbeliever, but you're not an unbeliever anymore. You believe [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; another thing about this mercy seat you saw saw a moment ago, uh, the slab and and the and the cherubams on top and God speaking, whether you believe it or don't believe it, you want to believe this." And God said, "And you put two cherubams on top." Said to Moses, "And I will meet you there." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, &gt;&gt; friends. However you interpret that, &gt;&gt; right? Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Bring it to us. Bring it to me. I'm seeking to bring it to you. There is a place and I won't end this service before I've said the a few more things. There is a place where God has promised to meet you. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you where it is. Tell me where it is. I can tell you where it is. It's wherever the word of God is being unfolded. Wherever it's wherever it's coming to its final end, its final fulfillment. when God is calling and he says in the end time that he's going to call a people, he's going to call a bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And you find that scripture, that promise would be in that box. That promise is in the ark. That promise was in Christ who hung on the cross. That promise is in the message. And that promise is being fulfilled. It's either fulfilled in the past or is being fulfilled or will be fulfilled. I don't know which and I don't care which. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it has been fulfilled or is being fulfilled. I want to have the word that is uh that is the mercy seat for this hour. I want a living mercy seat. And I'm here as a testimony to tell you he's at his mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's absolutely at his mercy seat. &gt;&gt; And why do I want to say that that way? Because I've been there. &gt;&gt; I've been there and he's talked to me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; At the mercy seat &gt;&gt; when I've given myself and I'm appealing to you to give yourself to the word as I spoke of it earlier in the f earlier this service. You ponder those things. You don't try to figure them out. &gt;&gt; They can't be figured out. &gt;&gt; You'll never understand it. Tell me how. And this prophet would say how God would have mercy upon a foul people like us. &gt;&gt; And people want to take on an heir. And well, I'm kind of a fairly good person. There is no one good. That's why even when the man came to Jesus said, "Good master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? Why callst thou me good? There's none good but God." &gt;&gt; That's what you have to accept. There's none good but God. &gt;&gt; And he in his mercy at the mercy seat gave us his righteousness. &gt;&gt; That's why you're chosen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why that's how you become elect. &gt;&gt; You don't become elect because you believed a certain thing and somebody figured it all out. Now you become elect. &gt;&gt; That's not how it happened. You become elect because you one day you found you could do nothing for yourself. &gt;&gt; You found yourself a failure. &gt;&gt; You found yourself condemned. &gt;&gt; And you said, "Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh God." [Music] &gt;&gt; It's a little chorus I wanted to sing. I asked if Linda could be here for me. I want to sing it. Maybe Brother Ryan, you can help me. We're not done the service. I just want to sing this chorus. Mercy rewrote my life. I wonder how many here want to raise your hand and say that's exactly what happened. Brother Ed Mercy. I didn't have it. I can tell you I've I've lived a fairly straight life, but I needed mercy. [Music] I told my wife last night about a debt that I just felt to pay off. We've been married 62 years, but I told her last night of a debt that I paid off in human life. That's not to make me great. I'm absolutely nothing. I needed mercy. Doesn't matter how many good things you've done, you needed mercy. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what kind of a birth you had or what kind of a country you came from, you needed mercy. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you if you want to believe me or not believe me, but mercy is found in this message. &gt;&gt; Mercy is found in the word of God. &gt;&gt; That was that word was none other than the making of the son of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I have a few more things to say. It is where a person can if you try to figure it out, you can enter into a realm of almost confusion. And that's why brother Brandham had to explain I am a son of man. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was asked, he said, "Are you the son of man?" He said, "No." "Is the pillar of fire the son of man?" "No." He said, he said, "I am a son of man." &gt;&gt; revealing &gt;&gt; the son of man. So somehow in the complexity of of a man in flesh is it a veil? Yes. God's word is veiled. [Music] &gt;&gt; God's word is veiled in a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know something, friends? Like Tommy Osburn said, [Music] Tommy Osbborne, he said, "You won't see this again." [Music] Tommy Osbbor who knew to come to brother Brandham concerning would God hear me if I prayed or Roberts did also you can read it in David Edwin Harold's book professor Harold from Birmingham Alabama the world recognized it folks. The world recognized it when he was hanging on the cross in in in different units. Finally, there was the thunder and the rocks rolled and all these things happened. The earthquake came and they said, "Surely this was the son of God." &gt;&gt; Right? Too late. &gt;&gt; Right. but for the wrong purpose. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's not an earthquake that reveals him. &gt;&gt; It's not an earthquake that suddenly makes and when people have I can tell you if there's a giant earthquake which they're expecting for Vancouver. If it happens and when it happens and there will be people here just like there is today &gt;&gt; and people calling you think they won't call on God. Of course they will. Sorry folks, that's not &gt;&gt; what the earthquake came for. &gt;&gt; The earthquake simply confirmed that God who is the creator of the earth, he lets things convulse. But you've already had a prophet. You're sitting on a whole &gt;&gt; cauldron &gt;&gt; of boiling earth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's not the fact that it bursts open that people are going to call on God. That's fine. That's fine. But that's not it. They call it they call on God because a voice and the Holy Spirit of God speaks to the individual says this is me. &gt;&gt; I'm meeting you at the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you got that? I'm meeting you at the mercy seat. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's evolved. The mercy seat was that box. And in Israel, they're making perhaps that very box and overlaying it with gold. He'll not be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And people in the Philippines, God bless the Philippine people here. I was over there when they had people being crucified. [Music] And it's a cruel thing. They're being crucified, aren't they, brother Ernie? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And dragged on the crosses. Do they gain any righteousness? Won't give them one second in heaven. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; If they only knew and some have come to know. And how we thank God, Brother Ernie, for every every book, every translation, everything that ever has been done, every gospel that has been preached, Brother Ernie's been there many times and preached. [Music] And even if one came at the sound of the gospel, friends, it's not the multitudes. The multitudes left him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The 70 of the ministry left him. &gt;&gt; And since then have come, you don't find me to be anti. I'm not anti. But I can tell you all these I I was at an ecumenical movement &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; meeting. All of you know what ecumenical we all get together. How do you all get together and throw all your mistakes into a pot and somehow come up with some victorious thing that God is doing? It's utter nonsense. &gt;&gt; It's utter nonsense. I go on a record saying it's utter nonsense. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I stood in this service and the people were sitting on chairs and in the sofa and on the on the floor and they'd heard a radio broadcast and someone heard something and they wished me to come over to Vancouver Island and I did. 22 people were in the room. I said now I don't I didn't know any of those people except the people had invited me. said, "I don't know these people." I said, "Now, perhaps this one here might be Salvation Army. This one might be Catholic. This one here might be Baptist. This one here might be, you know, whatever, whatever, one of the other denominations." And I said, "We all have come together." I said, "Now," I held my Bible. I said, "This Bible says that Jesus is the word." And I happen to know that you believe a different word than these people do. And you believe a different word than these people do. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We got to be careful in the message. And you people believe something different than these people believe. &gt;&gt; And would the would the real Jesus stand up? &gt;&gt; You never saw such a quiet crowd. &gt;&gt; And out of there came a family to become believers there in Brother Roger Smith's church. today. How did it evolve and come from that? I friends in this very very deceptive age, I would want to have the word that God was free and God felt comfortable to stand behind. He even came the the B the scripture says that he became flesh and the prophet said he came down where you and I are. Jesus was born of a woman &gt;&gt; like you were for one purpose. He wanted to be near you. He wanted you to understand him. He want and God wanted to be understood &gt;&gt; by the people. Can you imagine? God has done all of these things so he could be understood by the people. [Music] Okay, we'll just sing. I'd like to sing this song. Mercy rewrote my life. Mercy re my heart. His mercy re my heart. I should have fallen. My soul cast down. of mercy rule my heart once again. Oh mercy rule my heart. Oh, mercy re my life. [Applause] I should have fallen. My soul cast my life. &gt;&gt; I'd like the congregation to say mercy. Mercy &gt;&gt; that you didn't deserve. &gt;&gt; Say mercy. &gt;&gt; Mercy &gt;&gt; that only one had. &gt;&gt; Only one had. [Music] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. However, whatever form, people could talk about all kinds of form, but whatever form it was, all I can tell you that in the beginning, that word possessed mercy and that's the only place of his mercy. And that is why God would say to Moses of so many thousand years ago, in there of all the nations of the world, am I making sense to you? of all the nations, of all the peoples, of all the kingdoms. But God calls a people. Why does he call a people? I don't know. But that's his own prerogative. &gt;&gt; He calls whom he calls. &gt;&gt; And if Jesus was the word made flesh and could stand on earth and say, "And they left him. They left me." The mercy seat saying they left me. [Music] &gt;&gt; The mercy seat saying 70 ministers which I called left me because I couldn't understand. You know what he's being reduced down? He's not trying to get people to leave him. He's trying to get people to see that there's one way. That thing that has spoken to you, that thing that illuminates. I'm looking at you young people. You really desperately need &gt;&gt; something to illuminate. And if you've experienced it, then you can say, "I thank God. &gt;&gt; I thank God for this uh unspeakable gift." Because you can't earn it. You can't do anything for it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm speaking of, friends. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm speaking of. &gt;&gt; I'm not a young man, but I woke up this morning before I even leave washing my face. I stand at thanking the Lord. Thank you. We have this kind of relationship. Thank you that I can talk to you. Thank you that you've made yourself known. &gt;&gt; Thank you that we have such a peace. &gt;&gt; Thank you that mercy rewrote my life. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes, please. [Music] Here we are. since Pentecost. You remember he returned then to Paul after that and to Peter in the prison as the pillar of fire. Remember that. But in the last days, he's supposed to return again. You remember that? in the last days. Say, "Oh, yeah." Don't take it lightly. If you believe that he's returned in the last days, &gt;&gt; to come back to come back again to manifest the son of man to show to show the word the light. The traditions has been will be wiped away. There is nothing going to bother it. It's going to be done anyhow. &gt;&gt; God just tear them denominations and traditions down. And friends, a little further on in the book, further he says here, the whole mercy seat is sitting in plain view. Anybody can see it. The veil is rent. God of glory. The whole mercy seat comes into plain view. How God could have mercy on foul sinners as us when he hid himself was a mystery. And now it's in plain view or in full view revealed by his word. It's always the word constantly. That is God. It's the word that opens it up. It's the word that opens it up. If those people would have known the word of God that day when Jesus died, they would have seen the mercy seat. They would have seen who he was. And now it's repeated again. &gt;&gt; Pardon? Excuse me. It's repeated again. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about history now. We're talking about today. I know I'm a little bit over time, but just sit tight for a few moments before I close. But now it's repeated. &gt;&gt; It's not enough for us to look back and say, "Well, they missed it." Oh, I I would have seen it. You would have. Well, now's your chance. &gt;&gt; Now's your opportunity. Hello all up in the congregation in the balconies and so on. Now is your opportunity. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Young people, press through. You say, "Well, what's the press through?" Well, I would say take a message like this and ponder it. &gt;&gt; Take it a line at a time and ponder it. Ask yourself some questions. Ponder it. I can tell you one thing. I can tell you friends. this rapture, this promise that that we have. I was talking to some members of my family last night for a few moments. I'm taking very very seriously the catching away, &gt;&gt; the rapture of the church, &gt;&gt; the change of this body. I'm taking that very very serious. I don't want to have given these years of my life and miss that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to have a prophet say, "Don't miss it." &gt;&gt; Means that some possibly can miss it. I wouldn't want to have preached here as many times as I have and have people miss it. We don't want to miss it. Say, "Well, if I'm elected, I'm going to be there." Yes, that's exactly right. But you have to believe the right things. You must be a believer &gt;&gt; of those things that when when Satan comes to whisper a question or a doubt and I know that looking over a congregation this size each one of your lives have been touched by somebody who's cooled off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? &gt;&gt; It is absolutely the true &gt;&gt; and face up to it &gt;&gt; and take the take the stand within yourself. Don't miss the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Don't leave the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; And see, people cool off to the message, start questioning this, questioning that. You're leaving the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Please tell me, please tell me how's a person going to come to the I don't care whether it's a slab in the Old Testament or the ark itself or the Torah or what form you might have it. But listen to me. I don't care how how educated you are. I don't care how smart you are. I don't care how much you've read or studied or or any of those things. I don't care how strong you are, how athletical you are, how how anything you are, but when it comes into you, just remember now. Remember, young men, remember, you're just flesh and blood. I want you to look at the mercy seat and tell me how how how does it work? How how does this function? I want to figure this out before I participate. H how do I look upon this slab? How do I look into this box? How to look upon these two tables of stone? Yeah, they said he was up in the mountain and God wrote these. I'm taking it right down. And then they say, "Well, this this fellow was born of a virgin." I don't know. How did that happen? And now somebody's saying he's he's a mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; H how how does he he was born like I was born. Here's the cradle he was weded in. Here's the person who bore him. Mercy seat, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he could say, "If you believe on me, you have eternal life. You won't die." &gt;&gt; How can I believe that? M &gt;&gt; and now we have a group of people here today and I'm talking to you. &gt;&gt; This message is the word of God. The same God &gt;&gt; that has the essence of eternal life &gt;&gt; has it in it. &gt;&gt; And it calls for one thing that you believe. &gt;&gt; Maybe you can't explain it. And here a brother's telling you on the authority of God's word. You you don't have to explain it. You can't understand it. You can't get your mind around it. How would the God of eternity how the God who flung the universes in place, that God is interested in me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wants to dwell in me. &gt;&gt; What kind of preposterous is this? This is the truth. This is what Jesus said. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we can't believe him. We can't believe anybody. &gt;&gt; Am I being too plain? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; We can't believe him. We can't believe anybody. He said, "I will be in the Father, and the Father will be in me, and I will be in you." Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Deity will be in you. And then we have a prophet that raises up in this generation says he wants to live in you. It is him in you. Now that has happened. That's what makes this group unique. That's what makes it different is because this God is in you. &gt;&gt; Now if you said that just to me I say well that's nice. Thank you. Pat you on the back or I'm saying it to you. You can take it however you wish. But I'm trying to speak on the authority of that message &gt;&gt; and the God of that message. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if that prophet could say that, then I feel that I can at least be an echo and echoed the same thing. &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's that's the veil today. You're the veil to this world." &gt;&gt; And if they tore that veil like that, we're not going to have an easy time. We're not looking for an easy time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not preaching an easy time. &gt;&gt; But the people of this world, they fight and struggle. We have something at least to fight and struggle for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. &gt;&gt; You know, all kinds of people trying to figure this out. When did it come? Well, it didn't come. Well, he wasn't there. I I was reading he's not there when this actually happened. And he didn't hunt out of season. And don't forget I said that nonsense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I can prove he was there. I can prove he can. You haven't proved anything. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I I can prove it was by a rocket. I can prove that the winds that were blowing were Oh, you are such a smart person. &gt;&gt; It's amazing that you couldn't speak eternal life into somebody. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I look down your faces. I know people talk about, "Oh, well, this one kind of cooled off and that one they're not walking we're walking with the message anymore." Who what are they walking with? &gt;&gt; Who's their absolute? Where's the absolute? &gt;&gt; Don't tell me you don't need an absolute. We need an absolute. I want an absolute. I have a right to an absolute. &gt;&gt; If somebody's going to say, "We have the right to eternal life." I want to know how &gt;&gt; believe on him &gt;&gt; whom God has sent. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] And I saw another mighty angel come from come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was a upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. Do you see this poor body here? I was sitting in that service when the prophet first showed the picture. &gt;&gt; I was sitting there. My family was sitting there. Do you remember that, Linda? Do you remember sitting there? long time ago. We were sitting there and he showed that this picture held it up. But it actually is this a down here. See, this is the earth here. &gt;&gt; That's why they showed it in Life magazine, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he's actually looking down on the earth. &gt;&gt; True. But he just and then he said there they've got it. They need to turn it to the right. &gt;&gt; So he just turned it and when he turned it the whole audience just gasped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We all went I did too. &gt;&gt; He said now who do you see? &gt;&gt; Right. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. and I took a copy of the picture and we had a little blonde girl in in our apartment and she came in. My wife says, "Is her name Barbara?" Anyway, she's very pretty little girl about about that tall and she just came running in and I held up this picture and I said, "Who's that?" She says, "It's Jesus." I thought, "Oh, the simplicity of a child. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then someone else looks at it and says, "Well, I figured out. I think there was a a rocket that they exploded over St. Ed over Edward's base in California." Yeah. Carry on. Carry on. Carry on. And when you got it all figured out, just put one great big bold letter out of it and bold dead. &gt;&gt; Dead. Dead. Dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You brothers know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; We all have encyclopedias. &gt;&gt; I got a page out of one here. That's one page. And this whole side and down to there is on mercy. And I guarantee you'd be asleep by the time I got reading all of that. &gt;&gt; And I'm sorry I can't say I'm not sorry, but I'm I'm happy to let you know that when I got to the end of it, I can't say it's thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; But I can I can give you after these scriptures have been these scriptures to me. uh these quotes. How many sees him standing? &gt;&gt; The mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; Brother Jim, thank you. You sent this to me. The word made flesh unveiled before us. We're talking about him this time. The Alpha and the Omega. &gt;&gt; He that was, which is, and shall come. The root and the offspring of David was the son of man, &gt;&gt; the son of God, &gt;&gt; son of man and will be son of David. &gt;&gt; You will be with all your heart. Uh you'll you believe it with all your heart is the question. Unveiling himself in every age brought to the believer veiling himself in human flesh from the unbeliever. He is hid behind a veil. May God break every veil. &gt;&gt; And we see him as he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God break every veil. &gt;&gt; Every doubt that clouds your mind, may God break it. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm trying to be I'm trying to be gracious. I've been in large congre in large conventions. I know there's all kinds of trinitarians there and there may be here. Please explain for me how somebody says, "Oh, how I love Jesus." Just a moment. You stop there. But I refuse to go into this water and be baptized in his name. You do? &gt;&gt; How you want to be baptized? I want to be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. Let's get real. None of those are a name. &gt;&gt; Who you going to be? Who you going to be baptized in? If you haven't been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you have not been baptized. And every person in this book that was ever baptized was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And yet people today will bow to that and honor that and all the rest of it. And I I say you haven't got anything. And every one of you that have gone to the water to be buried with him. I love old brother Daniels and Daniel Evans his father in India. He old workhorse and he's baptizing people in the water muddy dirty water. But he are out there baptizing them. a couple of them baptizing. His son was baptizing also. And he he when he got on this subject, he said, "The father didn't die for you. The Holy Ghost didn't die for you. Jesus Christ died for you. He was buried and he raised up again. Hallelujah." And that's how he was baptizing the people. I said, "God bless that old man. He's gone on now to his reward." Hallelujah. How many people can say praise the Lord with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we stand to our feet? &gt;&gt; I thank you, Father, for this mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Oh, what mercy we have found. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a glorious foundation we have found. Foundations for the families, foundation for the churches, &gt;&gt; foundation, oh God, for our faith. Our faith is anchored. &gt;&gt; Anchored securely in the fact that it is you and none else than you. You've come on the scene in our day and in our time. Oh, it is Jesus. Yes, it is Jesus. How we thank you, Lord. I pray that you'll bless this faithful congregation of people and those that are praying for us, those that are streaming, &gt;&gt; Lord. Bless this bride. Some of them we won't meet till we cross over, but we pray by your grace, by your mercy, Lord Jesus. And you're full of that grace and mercy. And we will meet with those who have gone before. We will meet with the messenger of this age. We'll meet with the great saints of this age and those that were gone before. We'll meet with the apostles and we look forward to meeting with them around the marriage supper of the lamb. We pray Lord that you will bless oh God your people and as we as we are coming to a close of this service and for this evening service asking that you will come forth Lord it's you we come here to meet with not one another. In Jesus name. I'd like to sing, Linda. Oh, it is Jesus. Yes, it is Jesus. Is Jesus. This is Jesus. [Music] Glory Jesus. Give me my soul. [Music] Love his heart and his love.

We pray your special special nearness and the blessing of your presence. What we are unable to do individually to the individual person but we can pray God's blessing upon them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God bless you.
