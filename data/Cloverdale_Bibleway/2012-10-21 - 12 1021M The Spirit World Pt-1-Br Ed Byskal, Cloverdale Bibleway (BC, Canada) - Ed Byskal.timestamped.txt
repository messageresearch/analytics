[0:40] in it.
[0:44] And there is joy
[0:48] and victory.
[0:52] Oh, have you been
[0:56] beneath the mountain?
[1:00] Oh, there's no other
[1:04] place to go.
[1:08] Oh, flowing down
[1:12] from Calary mountain.
[1:17] It will wash
[1:20] you white as snow other waters and other
[1:26] waters
[1:29] will be bitter.
[1:33] Oh, they just can
[1:36] not satisfy.
[1:41] Oh, but this mountain
[1:45] it goes forever
[1:49] and in never
[1:52] never shall cry
[1:56] [Music]
[2:02] the mountain
[2:05] for There's no one
[2:09] place
[2:12] [Music]
[2:14] down
[2:17] [Music]
[2:25] white as snow. Oh, have you been?
[2:29] And
[2:31] [Music]
[2:34] the mountain
[2:37] there
[2:45] going down
[2:48] [Music]
[2:56] you my soul.
[3:01] Hallelujah.
[3:03] Amen.
[3:04] David, want to greet you all in the name
[3:07] of our Lord Jesus. We just I have a lot
[3:09] of ring and reverber here, brother Ben,
[3:11] if we can get that down just a little
[3:13] bit.
[3:14] We've been discussing, brother John was
[3:16] speaking on Friday night at Young
[3:17] Peoples as we've been going through the
[3:18] seals and now in preparation for the
[3:20] winter camp, just having a greater
[3:21] consecration and taking this next month
[3:24] and just really setting ourselves aside
[3:26] in preparation for the meetings with our
[3:28] brother Aaron. And I think that's just a
[3:30] wonderful thing that we can do, but also
[3:32] for this morning and for this evening. I
[3:33] believe God has in mind for every
[3:35] service and that it's just going to be
[3:37] adding stone upon stone all the way up
[3:39] to the winter camp. We don't have to
[3:40] wait for winter camp. Amen. I think we
[3:42] should get to winter camp just at the
[3:44] absolute pinnacle of our experience and
[3:46] God can just add upon that when we get
[3:48] there. Amen. So why don't we stand?
[3:50] Let's just prepare our hearts this
[3:51] morning. Let's sing all to Jesus I
[3:53] surrender. All to him I freely give. And
[3:56] when brother Andrew took a little part
[3:58] of the young people's service on Friday
[4:00] and he was speaking about how he was
[4:02] moved when he was going through the
[4:04] third seal and it was speaking on how
[4:06] the Catholic Church was charging for the
[4:08] prayers of the saints but then at the
[4:09] end of Revelations how Jesus was saying
[4:11] how he gives freely and I'm thankful
[4:15] that he said that whosoever could would
[4:17] come can drink of the waters of life
[4:18] freely. So let's give of ourselves
[4:20] freely this morning as he's given to us.
[4:22] Amen. Let's just surrender everything we
[4:24] have this morning as we sing it. Amen.
[4:29] All

[15:02] morning. Amen. We're going to go to
[15:04] prayer at this time. And it's good to
[15:06] have our brother John home with us. I'd
[15:07] like to just ask our brother John Anders
[15:08] if he would just come and take these
[15:10] prayer requests
[15:11] before the Lord. We had a prayer request
[15:14] written in for our brother Albert, the
[15:16] pastor of the church in Nazareth,
[15:18] Belgium. He was taken to the hospital
[15:20] this morning after he collapsed behind
[15:22] the pulpit. His condition is stable. Is
[15:24] being checked in the hospital. He is
[15:26] conscious and we're just asking, they're
[15:28] asking that we would remember him and
[15:29] the congregation there. And our brother
[15:31] John was speaking with uh brother Albert
[15:34] just over the iPad this morning in the
[15:36] in the pastor's study and uh he looked
[15:39] and sounded well but as we heard more
[15:42] details they they didn't even find a
[15:44] pulse on him after he had collapsed
[15:45] behind the pulpit as the congregation
[15:47] just began to pray for him. Amen. He was
[15:50] revived and we thank God for sparing our
[15:52] brother Albert. We just ask that he
[15:53] would be granted a full recovery and
[15:56] that God would bless him in the
[15:57] congregation during this time. And also
[15:59] our brother Jeff and sister Aubrey
[16:01] Hoffer just asking prayer for their son
[16:03] Ryan as he is in surgery this morning
[16:05] having his appendix taken out. Just
[16:07] asking that God would touch him and
[16:08] grant him a swift recovery. Amen. If
[16:10] there's something on your heart that you
[16:11] just like to remember before the Lord,
[16:13] you let it be known with an upraised
[16:14] hand as our brother John would come.
[16:16] Amen. Thank you, brother John.
[16:22] Amen. Heavenly Father, we lift up our
[16:26] hands and our hearts. God, just wanting
[16:29] your presence to soak down into the
[16:30] inside of our souls. We want to approach
[16:33] you with thanksgiving and with love,
[16:35] Lord. Want to thank you for your amazing
[16:38] grace. We lift up our voices and the
[16:41] hallelujah's ring today. the glories to
[16:44] God, the praises, the thanksgivings to
[16:47] be all throughout the service, Lord, of
[16:49] what you've done for us, the redeeming
[16:52] power of God to break open the seals in
[16:55] our lives and release to us your life
[16:58] and your presence. We want to say thank
[17:00] you today, Lord. is even a few hours ago
[17:03] our brother Albert Lord ministering
[17:05] there in Belgium collapsing behind the
[17:08] pulpit not having a pulse but to know
[17:10] that there was believers and saints of
[17:12] the living God could bring their pastor
[17:15] Lord back to life and he could be
[17:17] serving you even tonight Lord and we
[17:19] could speak to him and brother David
[17:21] Ierson and the church we just hold them
[17:24] up right now Lord as as the congregation
[17:27] Lord as they hold up one another Lord
[17:29] that could happen to us Lord Lord, that
[17:31] could happen to any of us, Lord. Our
[17:33] lives are so fragile. As our brother
[17:36] Timothy spoke, Lord, human weaknesses,
[17:38] Lord. We all have them, Lord. But we're
[17:41] so thankful for the power of the cross.
[17:44] So thankful for the power of the blood
[17:47] that brother Tom spoke about. Lord, it
[17:50] just seems like no matter what our needs
[17:52] are, your word is meeting the need of
[17:54] the hour. Even beforehand, Lord Jesus.
[17:58] And we want to confess, Lord, that your
[18:00] word has met the end time conditions.
[18:03] And we've brought our families together,
[18:05] our brothers and our sisters. Our
[18:08] children are here under the sound of the
[18:09] gospel. We want to give respect, Lord,
[18:12] to the presence of God, Lord. And we
[18:15] come humbling ourselves. We come bowing
[18:18] our heads and lifting our hands as our
[18:20] brother Ryan has led us in worship, in
[18:23] surrender, in surrender. Lord, don't let
[18:25] it just be songs out of our lips, but
[18:28] let it be hearts that are consecrated,
[18:30] hearts that are honest, hearts that are
[18:33] going into that private little room,
[18:35] Lord, and coming out well and coming out
[18:38] delivered, Lord. We're asking for
[18:40] missing limbs this year, Lord. Sons and
[18:43] daughters, Lord, that are out of their
[18:45] place, that you would bring them missing
[18:47] limbs back to their place. Even
[18:50] physically, God, you're a miracle
[18:52] working God. You're our strength giver,
[18:55] our El Shadi, Lord. And we're holding up
[18:58] to your bosom, Lord. Jesus Christ. Same
[19:03] yesterday, today, and forever flowing
[19:05] through this service. Ministering
[19:08] spirits, Lord. Angels in this meeting.
[19:11] Lights, streaks of light going through
[19:13] this room right now. Lord, let somebody
[19:16] reach out and touch the hem of your
[19:18] garment for unspoken request and hands
[19:21] that are lifted up. this prayer request
[19:23] Lord for this need. we just lay hands on
[19:25] it and pray that you would show
[19:27] yourself, Lord, in that family and in
[19:29] that need, Lord. Lord, when we saw our
[19:32] brother with all this morning come into
[19:34] the church, what a miracle, oh God, to
[19:37] know that just a few days ago, he was in
[19:39] that hospital room and you've brought
[19:41] him back, Lord, and he's right here
[19:44] among us, Lord, with Sister Karen, God.
[19:47] Lord, how we ought to rejoice, God, and
[19:49] that miracles are happening and healings
[19:52] and salvation is flowing. God,
[19:56] bless our pastor today, Lord. Our
[19:59] brother Biscoll, how we love him. We
[20:01] love the gift in his life. He has
[20:04] brought us to you so many times. Lord,
[20:07] you have brought yourself so real to us
[20:09] by his ministry and by his life. And we
[20:12] pray once more that you would use the
[20:14] gift in his life. strengthen him, Lord
[20:17] Jesus. We believe we're at the closing
[20:19] hours of time, the closing moments, and
[20:23] how we need to hear your voice. Thus
[20:25] sayaith the Lord or keep still, Lord. So
[20:28] Lord, we're just keeping still right
[20:30] now. Just holding ourselves that you
[20:32] would come and minister to our lives.
[20:35] Every person, God, bless the offering,
[20:38] Lord, the the giving of our tithes and
[20:40] our offerings and the missions work,
[20:43] God, that's going around the world. just
[20:45] continue to multiply it, Lord. Lord, we
[20:48] give you this day, Lord Jesus. May the
[20:50] supernatural just be present here and go
[20:53] out, Lord, to many places as we just
[20:56] love you, Lord, and appreciate your
[20:58] appearing for answering every prayer in
[21:02] the name of Jesus Christ.
[21:04] Amen.
[21:07] [Music]
[21:12] Amen. You may have your seats.
[21:15] Once again, we just want to say God
[21:17] bless you. Welcome everyone into the
[21:18] house of the Lord this morning. Those
[21:21] who are joining us by way of streaming
[21:22] and telephone hookup, we just want to
[21:23] say God bless you to you as well. Amen.
[21:25] Why don't we sing Amazing Grace, How
[21:27] Sweet the Sound. If the brothers just

[21:32] that maybe just as we sing this song.

[28:38] till you can fight again.
[28:42] There is no
[28:45] need to fear.
[28:47] I am right here.
[28:52] Wounded soldier.
[29:03] Well, sometimes the greatest battles
[29:08] are fought within your soul
[29:12] and no one sees your struggles
[29:16] cuz you won't let them show.
[29:21] You're the walking wounded
[29:25] pretending to be strong.
[29:29] But deep inside you're barely hanging
[29:34] on.
[29:37] And it's hard to find the courage
[29:41] to go on.
[29:44] I am coming for you. Wounded soldier.
[29:54] I will gently carry you upon my
[29:59] shoulders.
[30:01] I will give you time to men
[30:07] till you can fight again.
[30:11] There is no need to fear.
[30:16] I am right here.
[30:20] I am coming for you wounded soldier.
[30:30] I will gently carry you upon my
[30:34] shoulder.
[30:36] I will give you time to men
[30:42] till you can fight again.
[30:46] No, there's no need to fear.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; I am right here.
[30:56] Wounded soldier.

[31:19] [Applause]
[31:31] Amen. Thank you, Sister Courtney, Sister
[31:33] Sharon.
[31:34] Just as we prepare to turn the service
[31:36] to our brother Bisco, why don't we sing,
[31:37] "Oh, what a friend who walks beside me."
[31:41] Amen. Are you thankful? He promised he'd
[31:43] never leave us nor forsake us. Amen.
[31:45] What an assurance. Amen. Why don't we
[31:47] sing this as our pastor comes?
[31:49] Oh, what a friend
[31:55] who walks beside me.
[32:00] To hold my hand
[32:05] and to safely
[32:08] guide me.
[32:11] safe in his arms.
[32:16] He'll always
[32:18] hide me.
[32:20] Oh, what a friend
[32:25] he is to me. Have you found it so? He
[32:29] knows the way. He knows the way.
[32:35] My road is winding.
[32:40] Oh, and he can't see around.
[32:45] My pathway is bending.
[32:49] Oh, and he'll take me through.
[32:54] One day is ending.
[32:58] [Music]
[32:59] Oh, what a friend
[33:03] [Music]
[33:04] he is to me. Oh, what a friend. Who
[33:09] wants a friend
[33:13] who walks beside me
[33:18] to hold my hand
[33:23] and safely
[33:25] guide me
[33:28] in his arm?
[33:33] He will always
[33:35] hide me.
[33:38] What a great
[33:43] sing He knows the way once again.
[33:47] He love the way
[33:52] I love him when he
[33:57] can see around
[34:01] my pathway
[34:03] that day.
[34:05] And he'll take me through
[34:10] when day is ending.
[34:15] Oh, what a friend
[34:20] he is to thee.
[34:26] And thou
[34:28] art worthy,
[34:31] Lord. Thou art worthy.
[34:36] Oh, thou
[34:38] art worthy. Just in preparation for the
[34:41] word this morning, why don't we just
[34:42] sing it in worship to him? Thou art
[34:44] worthy oh to receive glory,
[34:49] all glory
[34:52] and honor.
[34:55] Glory
[34:57] and honor
[34:59] and power thou has created. Oh, for thou
[35:05] hast
[35:07] created
[35:09] has all things created.
[35:14] Thou hast created
[35:18] all things.
[35:23] and for thy pleasure
[35:28] they are created.
[35:33] Thou
[35:34] art worthy,
[35:37] oh Lord. Thou art worthy, Lord.
[35:41] Yes, thou
[35:44] are worthy.
[35:46] Oh, thou are worthy.
[35:51] Oh, thou
[35:53] art worthy
[36:00] to receive. Glory, all the glory
[36:07] and honor.
[36:10] Glory
[36:12] and honor
[36:14] and power.
[36:18] For thou hast
[36:21] created,
[36:23] has all things created.
[36:28] Thou hast created
[36:32] all things.
[36:38] And for thy pleasure
[36:42] they are created
[36:47] [Music]
[36:55] and for thy pleasure
[36:57] I am.
[36:59] Let's stand. Sing it that way.
[37:08] I am created
[37:12] and thou
[37:14] art worthy.
[37:17] Oh Lord,
[37:21] oh and for my pleasure
[37:26] I was created.
[37:31] How are
[37:35] you, oh Lord?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; I know we have a desire this morning to
[37:41] come into his presence. We just pray
[37:43] that he will give us access.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're coming here for the right
[37:48] purpose.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; We're gathered here at the right time
[37:52] and we've come, I believe, in the right
[37:54] atmosphere.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; And for thy glory, I have been created.
[37:59] And that's why I'm here to find out more
[38:02] about what your plan is for my life.
[38:06] Amen. I'm just going to have you join
[38:09] with me in prayer and then we're going
[38:11] to go to the word right away. Uh before
[38:13] we pray, we'll just
[38:16] uh let you know that brother John Lei
[38:19] and Sister Marie, they sent an email
[38:23] and uh they sent to brother John
[38:27] Andes. Uh we are still in Japan and we
[38:31] plan to leave for Korea on Wednesday the
[38:34] 16th which is really Tuesday for the US.
[38:38] Uh John has visited that's John Lei has
[38:41] visited several churches spent some time
[38:44] with a Catholic priest named Peter and
[38:47] attended a couple of Catholic masses. Uh
[38:51] the priest even took several books and
[38:54] it is uh it is Sunday here in Japan and
[38:58] John has rented a bicycle and will try
[39:01] to attend
[39:03] uh three to four church services and an
[39:05] English Catholic mass today. Uh God is
[39:09] faithful. We are in good health. John
[39:12] had a one and a half hour visit with
[39:14] four Jehovah's Witness young people.
[39:17] They asked a lot of questions. Every
[39:20] answer John gave, they said, they said,
[39:24] "Show me where it is that where that is
[39:27] in the Bible." Which of course he did.
[39:30] Uh they were extremely interested.
[39:32] Jehovah's Witnesses have over 200,000
[39:35] active members in Japan. Surely some of
[39:38] them are seeking the truth. John has
[39:41] probably handed out 4,000 tracks and
[39:44] several hundred message books. Continue
[39:47] to ask the people to pray, and that's
[39:49] why I'm reading this now, to pray that
[39:52] God will raise up a full-time translator
[39:55] in the Japanese language. Sister Grace
[39:58] and Brother John send greetings to the
[40:02] uh church there in Cloverdale, and
[40:04] brother Ed dedicated their baby winner,
[40:07] and that's not the name of the store.
[40:11] That's what they called her a winner.
[40:13] And so we'll just believe she's a
[40:14] winner. And their older daughter, Sister
[40:17] Rebecca, uh played the violin for about
[40:20] seven about seven years ago. God bless
[40:22] you. That's from Sister Marie and John
[40:24] Lei. So we'll remember them in prayer.
[40:27] Also, when when you leave here, don't
[40:30] don't do it just while we're here.
[40:31] Brother John prayed, but we want to take
[40:34] them. I'll tell you what, brother John
[40:36] Le is a worker.
[40:38] And there is one picture they sent and
[40:40] it's just uh there's just got to be
[40:43] hundreds and hundreds of bicycles all
[40:45] parked, you know, the way they do. So he
[40:48] just going down the sidewalk and and
[40:50] dropping a message book in every basket.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; There's always a way.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; There's always a way. You just have to
[40:57] think of another way. Oh, there's a
[40:58] basket. That's a place for a message.
[41:01] Amen. And you can be sure there'll be a
[41:03] lot of those that'll be read.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let's just ask God's
[41:07] blessing upon the word and upon the
[41:09] ministry today. Heavenly Father, I know
[41:12] that prayer has already been made. Songs
[41:15] of worship have been sung. And truly,
[41:18] Lord, we we are worshiping in spirit and
[41:23] in truth.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; And we are receiving your word that you
[41:27] have sent in this time
[41:30] &gt;&gt; as truth. And that truth will reveal you
[41:33] for you are the truth. Hallelujah. We
[41:36] believe that with all of our heart,
[41:38] Lord. There's not much in this world
[41:40] that's truth, but you are truth. And you
[41:43] have made it very abundantly clear. You
[41:46] have vindicated it. You have proven it.
[41:49] You have made it so evident. There's no
[41:52] reason for us to misstep or to miss what
[41:56] you are doing or saying. I pray you'll
[41:58] help us give us insight now and anoint.
[42:01] I pray myself as I uh stand here at the
[42:05] post of duty to speak the other ministry
[42:08] that is here ministry that is taking
[42:11] place Lord in other in Seattle Tacoma
[42:15] Victoria the saints that are there all
[42:17] who are streaming I pray oh God you're
[42:21] will you will bless and illuminate I
[42:24] pray the Holy Spirit will be present as
[42:26] everyone uh listens and attentively I
[42:30] pray you'll give us what we have need
[42:31] of. We thank you, Father, for this time,
[42:34] for this beautiful day that you've given
[42:36] us. And that we can be gathered here in
[42:38] one accord. Hallelujah. And in one
[42:42] spirit and in one mind. And when they on
[42:45] the day of Pentecost were all in one
[42:47] accord, then suddenly there came from
[42:50] heaven. We pray, oh God, that suddenly
[42:53] is this uni unity abides with amongst
[42:56] us. that a suddenly a a a wind from
[43:01] heaven will come, oh God, and fill
[43:03] everyone. And may the things which we
[43:06] speak be pleasing to you in the name of
[43:09] our Lord Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Uh I'll have you
[43:18] turn in your Bibles if you would to Luke
[43:21] the 17th chapter. Thank you, musicians.
[43:28] And I'm going to begin reading at verse
[43:31] 26
[43:38] and then we'll have a second reading in
[43:39] Hebrews 12.
[43:42] Now,
[43:44] um allow me to just make a few comments
[43:47] before we go into the scripture this
[43:49] morning. Uh it it'll require some
[43:52] thought. you know, we we won't be able
[43:56] to just be here as in a in a like a
[43:58] preaching and rejoicing service. I want
[44:00] you to think real deep. Uh we're we're
[44:04] living in tremendous times. Are are we
[44:06] not?
[44:08] &gt;&gt; And uh we direct a lot of our thoughts,
[44:12] a lot of our efforts towards the young
[44:14] people in the youth. I want to say to
[44:16] all that are on the side of youth that
[44:23] one one one
[44:25] disadvantage that you have and I say
[44:27] it's a disadvantage
[44:29] is that you only can see things in a
[44:31] very narrow scope because that's why you
[44:35] go to school you go to school you go to
[44:38] your places of learning to find out what
[44:41] the accumulated knowledge is what people
[44:44] have learned in the past. So you'll read
[44:47] things in your textbooks that have been
[44:50] uh discovered a long time ago by people
[44:54] who trial and error and and then they
[44:58] discover something and say you know what
[45:00] this works. They put it in a textbook,
[45:03] you study it, you read it, then you
[45:05] learn it and you say it this works and
[45:09] this mathematic equation or whatever
[45:12] this works and this is what this is what
[45:15] peoples have found over the centuries uh
[45:18] this uh political system and whatever
[45:20] more these things uh some things work
[45:22] and some things don't work but you learn
[45:25] that from accumulated knowledge and uh
[45:30] the Bible says says uh and that's why
[45:33] the Bible says this uh this before our
[45:36] scripture reading
[45:38] in Joel it says tell your children
[45:43] tell ye your children of it and let your
[45:47] children tell their children
[45:49] &gt;&gt; and their children another generation.
[45:53] There was a reason for that. And in the
[45:55] and and God gave commandment in the in
[45:59] the scripture also in Deuteronomy. I'm
[46:03] going to just read a couple of
[46:05] scriptures to make my point and then
[46:07] we'll move forward in this in the
[46:11] message. But in Deuteronomy 4 and 10,
[46:21] God spoke to Moses and he said,
[46:24] Especially,
[46:28] especially the day that thou stoodest
[46:31] before the Lord thy God in Horeb,
[46:35] when the Lord spake unto unto me, gather
[46:39] me the people together, and I will make
[46:42] them hear my words that they may learn
[46:46] to fear me all the days that they shall
[46:49] live upon the earth and that they may
[46:52] teach their children. Now the now it's
[46:57] important for us as parents and elder
[47:00] ones. You don't have to be a parent to
[47:02] teach the children and we teach them in
[47:05] more than one way. We teach them by
[47:07] living and we teach them by word also.
[47:10] And he said again in uh sixth chapter in
[47:12] the seventh verse. And thou shalt teach
[47:16] thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[47:19] thy children. Diligently unto thy
[47:22] children. And shalt talk about them when
[47:26] thou sitest in thine house. So when
[47:28] you're sitting in your house, you talk
[47:30] about it. Can you say amen? And when you
[47:34] walk by the way. When you go for a walk
[47:36] someplace, by the way. and when you lie
[47:39] down and when thou thou riseest up. So
[47:43] that pretty well covers the entire scope
[47:45] of the day. You'll talk about these
[47:47] things. You'll teach them and you'll
[47:49] tell them to your children.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And one verse that's like is also
[47:55] Deuteronomy 9. Thank you for standing.
[47:58] Uh but it's for your benefit.
[48:02] Deuteronomy 11 and 19.
[48:06] And it says, "And you shall teach them
[48:09] your children, speaking of them, when
[48:12] thou sitest in thine house, and when
[48:15] thou walkest by the way, and when thou
[48:18] liest down, and when thou riseest up."
[48:22] So God was very very conscious that
[48:24] these are things that we teach the
[48:26] children. And and why why do we teach
[48:30] the children? Because the children
[48:31] didn't have a chance to experience it.
[48:35] See, so they want you that heard about
[48:38] it, knew about it, or experienced it,
[48:41] one or the other, tell the children.
[48:43] Tell them when you're sitting down. Tell
[48:45] them when you're walking. Tell them when
[48:47] you lie down. Tell them when you rise up
[48:49] in the morning. In other words, these
[48:51] things are important because they're
[48:53] eternal things.
[48:56] And I I'll say one last thing because
[48:58] this is all leading into the message
[49:00] this morning is things that are taking
[49:05] place which are in the narrow scope. We
[49:08] say the the younger people, young
[49:11] families. So we experience things that
[49:14] are happening in the world. But someone
[49:17] who is older, which I am, and there's
[49:20] people lot much older, but they they you
[49:25] you see things that are taking place,
[49:27] but someone who's older says, "Ah, this
[49:30] is the result of something else.
[49:34] This is the consequence." So you see the
[49:37] consequence. A person might even see the
[49:40] judgment of God, but they don't know
[49:42] it's judgment. Judgment for what? What
[49:44] happened?
[49:46] this is a result of something but there
[49:48] are other people who have lived and I've
[49:51] lived a little bit longer and that's why
[49:52] we read the scripture because we see
[49:55] things now a prophet he will foretell
[49:58] something
[50:00] he foretells it and then on down the
[50:03] road and that's why the ministry is here
[50:06] because they study what the prophet of
[50:08] God said and you can as well but they
[50:11] have a special anointing from God to
[50:14] study what the prophet said and connect
[50:16] them together and then and then caution
[50:18] the people or teach the people because
[50:21] this is what the prophet has said this
[50:23] is what's going to come now this is what
[50:25] you're seeing
[50:26] &gt;&gt; and there are I'm experiencing it that's
[50:29] why I'm speaking this way there are
[50:31] times when I am able to read in the
[50:35] message and he's foretelling something
[50:38] and then I've lived perhaps long enough
[50:41] to actually see what he foretold come to
[50:44] pass and say, "Hey, I saw what it was
[50:47] before,
[50:49] &gt;&gt; and now he's screaming out against the
[50:51] people because of what they're doing,
[50:53] but I saw what it was like before that
[50:56] &gt;&gt; and saw what it was like and heard and
[50:59] see it in the message and then see the
[51:01] consequence or see the result of it."
[51:04] And people who are born and raised up
[51:06] under the consequence, they think this
[51:09] normal
[51:10] &gt;&gt; and I can stand here and say, "Mm-
[51:13] that's not normal. That is not normal.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; That's the result of something way back
[51:18] here. You say, "Well, this is just
[51:20] normal." I can say, "Uh, no, it's not
[51:22] normal. It's actually judgment.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; God's actually judging cuz he already
[51:27] foretold it here and I live back there."
[51:30] &gt;&gt; So, you you see my point.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you as we read.
[51:37] And as it was, this is verse 26 of Luke
[51:41] 17. And as it was in the days of Noah,
[51:45] so shall it be also in the days of the
[51:48] Son of Man. They did eat, they drank,
[51:51] they married wives, they were given in
[51:54] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[51:56] into the ark, and the flood came and
[51:59] destroyed them all. Likewise also as it
[52:01] was in the days of Lot, they did eat,
[52:04] they drank, they bought, they sold, they
[52:08] planted, they builded. But the same day
[52:11] that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained
[52:13] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[52:15] destroyed them all. Even thus shall it
[52:17] be in the day when the Son of Man is
[52:20] revealed. Now, just before I go on,
[52:24] there's nothing wrong with eating and
[52:26] drinking and buying and selling, but
[52:30] these were specifically different.
[52:33] There's nothing wrong with being married
[52:35] and being given in marriage, but this
[52:38] was kind of going beyond
[52:41] the normal. There was something
[52:44] significant about it. You understand?
[52:46] And we'll come to it. Then we'll turn to
[52:48] Hebrews the 12th chapter
[52:52] verse 25.
[52:57] See that you refuse not him that
[52:59] speaketh
[53:02] and notice the word please speaketh.
[53:05] For if they escaped not who refused him
[53:08] that spake on earth.
[53:10] This is speaking of the time of Moses.
[53:12] Now when God dealt and spoke with Moses,
[53:14] God spoke on earth. Much more shall not
[53:18] we escape if we turn away from him that
[53:22] speaketh from the heaven whose voice and
[53:26] the word for voice and the word for
[53:28] speaketh are two different words which
[53:30] I'll I'll describe a little later whose
[53:34] voice then shook the earth but now he
[53:37] hath promised saying yet once more I
[53:40] shake not the earth only but also heaven
[53:44] and this word uh and the reason heaven
[53:47] is the heaven is not just air. The
[53:50] prophet explains exactly why the heavens
[53:53] are filled with demonic forces and
[53:56] powers and you if you're on the internet
[53:58] or anything like that, you'll find all
[54:00] of that garbage comes out of heaven.
[54:03] It's locked up in heaven and God has
[54:06] reserved the heaven for uh the voice of
[54:09] God. But these things are in heaven and
[54:13] they are they are in a in a in another
[54:16] realm in another dimension which only
[54:18] came into being in this time. Prophet
[54:21] says television was here when Elijah was
[54:23] here. Television was here when e Adam
[54:26] was here. Television was here when Jesus
[54:28] was here but Jesus didn't use it.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus never had his word digitized.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus never had his word on a disc.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus never had his word in a book. But
[54:39] as time went on and technology went on,
[54:43] then his words were on a book. Now his
[54:45] words are even in heaven.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said if they had this,
[54:49] if they had the ability or they could
[54:52] even capture those words and bring them
[54:54] back down. That's what they've said. We
[54:57] haven't we haven't come to that. So now
[54:59] his voice that shook the earth. And yet
[55:02] verse 27, "And this word yet once more
[55:05] signif.
[55:17] Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[55:21] cannot be moved." Isn't that wonderful?
[55:24] Let us have grace whereby we may serve
[55:27] God acceptably with reverence and godly
[55:30] fear. For our God is a consuming fire.
[55:34] God bless you. You may have your seats.
[55:36] Thank you for being so patient.
[55:44] Now, here's a
[55:51] just let you get settled
[55:53] and have as little movement as possible,
[55:56] please.
[55:58] Here's a a brief summary of the message
[56:01] where I would like to go. I won't
[56:03] probably complete.
[56:06] Jesus describes in Luke 17, he describes
[56:10] the conditions that would exist in the
[56:13] end time. And because he uses very few
[56:16] words, I want to enlarge on that on
[56:18] those conditions.
[56:20] Paul, the first church age messenger,
[56:25] he describes what takes place at the
[56:28] sounding of the last church age
[56:30] messenger.
[56:32] And he refers Paul as a Paul is a
[56:35] theological genius really even though he
[56:38] counted everything that he learned as
[56:39] dung that he might win Christ but you
[56:42] can see he he has an incredible
[56:45] knowledge of the Old Testament in the
[56:48] scripture. So he reaches back into the
[56:50] Old Testament and describes how it was
[56:54] when Moses was hearing the word directly
[56:56] from God. And now remember, brother
[56:58] Brandham says that was the first time
[57:00] God started with Moses because the
[57:03] people said, "Don't speak to us directly
[57:05] anymore." It was too fearful to be in
[57:08] the presence of God and to hear the
[57:10] voice of God and and he said, "Let the
[57:14] people said to Moses, let God speak to
[57:16] you and then you come and tell us." And
[57:19] now a prophet in our day lets us know
[57:21] and the scripture bears it out. Then God
[57:24] didn't speak through the people direct
[57:26] to the people directly anymore. He spoke
[57:29] through a prophet. And thus from Moses
[57:31] forward is is the prophets declaring the
[57:34] word of the Lord. So Paul, he reaches
[57:37] into the background and brings it
[57:39] forward and speaks of of of how it will
[57:42] be that he spoke on earth. And that
[57:45] shook things, wouldn't they? See that
[57:47] you refuse not him that speaketh,
[57:50] whose voice then shook the earth, but
[57:53] it's prophesied, then it signif.
[58:02] I want to speak to you upon seeing the
[58:06] removal of those things.
[58:10] And I'm going to speak some from
[58:12] experience. There are things that are
[58:14] taking place in the world today which
[58:16] you that
[58:18] have been born in the season that of
[58:21] that happening,
[58:24] you wouldn't possibly know that these
[58:26] are what you're actually seeing is the
[58:30] removal of things.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to speak from personal
[58:33] experience.
[58:35] things which in my short lifetime
[58:38] did not exist
[58:41] uh years ago,
[58:43] not too many years ago.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:46] &gt;&gt; And uh and and then and then I'll go
[58:48] back to the message where the prophet
[58:50] speaks about the systems that are in
[58:52] place today. Political system,
[58:54] educational system, scientific system,
[58:57] all these very systems, the the justice
[58:59] system, the policing, all of these
[59:02] things. Hey, they've changed so
[59:05] dramatically that I can scarcely keep up
[59:08] with it myself. I just almost daily
[59:12] said, "Wow, imagine seeing that. That
[59:15] that that that's unheard of. That that's
[59:18] bizarre."
[59:23] &gt;&gt; And so you say, "Well,
[59:26] well, that's it starts to be normal."
[59:27] No, it's not normal.
[59:30] When you see, you know, 22 children
[59:33] blown away in a school and then another
[59:35] two, three in another school over here
[59:37] and have the prophet say that the
[59:39] educational system is of the devil
[59:42] &gt;&gt; and the devil is the author of death.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; And when you start to see things pull
[59:47] apart until until things are happening.
[59:51] So you say, "Well, it's some something.
[59:53] Let's fix the system." No, you can't fix
[59:55] the system because a prophet said it was
[59:57] done long back back here. And then I can
[1:00:01] go prior to that and say it never
[1:00:04] happened.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; That never happened. We never even
[1:00:08] thought of it. We never even thought of
[1:00:10] locking our car. We never thought of
[1:00:12] locking our house. We thought people who
[1:00:14] locked their house were paranoid.
[1:00:17] Why? Because you could trust people.
[1:00:20] People were real. And this wasn't this
[1:00:22] isn't in a farm. This isn't in a little
[1:00:24] town. This is in a city. I lived in a
[1:00:27] city, a small city. But and so I I don't
[1:00:30] want to get ahead of myself. So now
[1:00:32] we're still in the summary. In one way,
[1:00:35] the conditions
[1:00:37] in one way the conditions that are
[1:00:39] described
[1:00:42] uh are really terrible on one side, but
[1:00:45] on the other hand, we enjoy much of it.
[1:00:49] You have a car parked out there. I have
[1:00:51] a car parked. I'm glad that somebody
[1:00:53] drilled for oil and gas and got gas and
[1:00:56] it went through a prochemical industry
[1:00:58] and came out as gas that comes to a pump
[1:01:01] and I'm glad I can go there. I'm not
[1:01:03] happy about the price I have to pay, but
[1:01:05] I'm glad I get some gas. So, it's not
[1:01:07] fun to run out of gas.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; See, I hope you understand. I I I am
[1:01:14] preaching.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; This is scripture. There are things that
[1:01:19] we enjoy
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; and and I'm glad I can turn the heat up
[1:01:23] and and be comfortable and be warm and
[1:01:25] be dry when it's raining
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; and a lot of other things. And you folks
[1:01:31] are sitting there like you you're not
[1:01:33] part of this world. I know you're a part
[1:01:36] of it. And that's why I will just keep
[1:01:37] plowing ahead
[1:01:40] because it appears it appeals to us in
[1:01:43] our modern way of life. These things
[1:01:45] appeal to us and we like them. We like
[1:01:48] to go to the shopping market or to the
[1:01:51] mall and get what we need. We like that.
[1:01:54] It wasn't in existence some time ago.
[1:01:57] So, we are living in a very in the very
[1:02:00] time of the removing of those things
[1:02:02] that are made because the apostle Paul
[1:02:05] said that it will be the removing of
[1:02:08] those things that are made and are
[1:02:11] things that are being literally removed
[1:02:13] or have been removed. And we've got now
[1:02:16] the consequence of it. But unless unless
[1:02:20] it's brought to you from the scripture.
[1:02:22] Well, why would the scripture bring it
[1:02:24] to us? Oh, that's a good question. To
[1:02:27] alert us to what season you were in
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; if these things are happening around you
[1:02:33] in your daily life and so on and so
[1:02:36] forth, it is saying to you this is the
[1:02:39] time
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; when God has sent a special message. A
[1:02:43] message. Now we refer a message this and
[1:02:45] I I believe the message and so and so.
[1:02:47] The message is the voice of God that has
[1:02:51] been sent to you to let you know that
[1:02:54] certain things are happening
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; or certain things are just to happen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; And he said that this voice will come
[1:03:01] just before God sends judgment on the
[1:03:04] world and takes his church out of the
[1:03:07] world. Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; And that's why we preach it behind a
[1:03:10] pulpit like this is because it's a
[1:03:13] spiritual happening. It's not just
[1:03:16] something social and political or
[1:03:18] whatever more. It's a spiritual
[1:03:20] happening and that are associated with
[1:03:23] there are other things which are
[1:03:25] associated with it because we humans are
[1:03:27] in contact with both the material and
[1:03:31] the supernatural.
[1:03:33] at least spiritual spiritual believers,
[1:03:36] born again believers.
[1:03:39] So I can attest to, as I said earlier, I
[1:03:42] can attest to the removing of these
[1:03:45] things,
[1:03:48] which until a few years ago, we didn't
[1:03:50] know anything about. For example,
[1:03:54] the medical system
[1:03:57] for the biggest part of our life. I, my
[1:04:00] wife and I, and and hey, we're not
[1:04:02] ancient, but I just want to show you how
[1:04:04] fast things are happening.
[1:04:07] I knew nothing about a waiting line
[1:04:12] or a waiting time.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Now, I know you look startled. I'm not
[1:04:17] from the Stone Age. I'm telling you how
[1:04:20] fast this has happened. The medical
[1:04:23] system has come apart. I never ever
[1:04:27] dreamed I would live at a time when the
[1:04:30] richest nation on earth, America, people
[1:04:33] people can't go to the hospital because
[1:04:35] it's a $30,000 bill or a $20,000 bill.
[1:04:39] That's so bizarre to me. I have a hard
[1:04:41] time getting my head around it because
[1:04:44] it never existed.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; It didn't exist. a waiting line to go to
[1:04:49] a hospital say, "Well, you're on a
[1:04:51] you're on a waiting line." We went to a
[1:04:53] hospital anytime I needed to went to a
[1:04:56] hospital that you just went and checked
[1:04:58] in.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; The doctor just put you in. You say,
[1:05:01] "Well, when was that?" That was in my
[1:05:03] day.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; And so when I look at these things, I
[1:05:07] say
[1:05:08] something is being moved.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; I'm actually seeing something disappear.
[1:05:14] something that I experienced which was a
[1:05:16] comfort and a and a and a benefit to the
[1:05:19] family. It's gone
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; and they have no hope of it getting
[1:05:24] better,
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; only getting worse.
[1:05:29] the economic system.
[1:05:32] The economic system
[1:05:35] uh
[1:05:37] leaders of the world right today leaders
[1:05:40] of the world are trying to cope with the
[1:05:43] economics of the entire globe. And so
[1:05:46] now we have a global economic system.
[1:05:48] Why? Because things have things that
[1:05:51] which the prophet of God spoke about. He
[1:05:54] spoke about the gold standard in quite
[1:05:56] some depth. and and uh uh I I will I'll
[1:06:00] read a few things in in just a little a
[1:06:03] little bit. But the leaders of the world
[1:06:05] are hopelessly and helpless to bring any
[1:06:10] sense of balance to the monetary system.
[1:06:14] And so you we we will carry we'll
[1:06:17] continue to carry uh monies in our
[1:06:20] pocket. But I lived to be in uh in
[1:06:23] Brother Milco's country and he and I
[1:06:25] were there and my wife was also there
[1:06:28] and I saw the I saw the kids uh sitting
[1:06:31] on the floor playing with a shoe box and
[1:06:34] the shoe box was filled with money this
[1:06:36] way
[1:06:38] and it was stuffed full and they're
[1:06:41] playing with it and I these kids are
[1:06:44] playing. Hey, this is not very long ago.
[1:06:46] They're playing with billions of
[1:06:48] dollars.
[1:06:50] I said, "Well, you know, well, it isn't
[1:06:53] really worth anything
[1:06:55] and a whole shoe box. You couldn't buy a
[1:06:57] loaf of bread." I said, "Well, you know,
[1:07:00] could I have some of that?" I felt like
[1:07:02] a beggar a wee bit, but can I have some
[1:07:04] of that? That they peeled me off $30
[1:07:07] billion.
[1:07:09] I stuck them in my bill folder. I
[1:07:11] thought, I'll go back and buy Vancouver.
[1:07:13] I'll buy the whole city.
[1:07:16] $30 billion. And Milo says they already
[1:07:19] took off four zeros.
[1:07:22] Already had taken off four zeros. They
[1:07:24] say, "Well, what happened?" It
[1:07:26] collapsed.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; It collapsed.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; This whole system got removed.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Germany has had it.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; My own brother-in-law was in the in the
[1:07:38] armed services and and and there was a a
[1:07:42] person they were bringing bringing money
[1:07:44] in a wheelbarrow.
[1:07:47] to get a loaf of bread.
[1:07:51] And no, they weren't giving this person
[1:07:52] a loaf of bread for a wheelbarrow full
[1:07:54] of money of German marks, one of the
[1:07:57] strongest currencies there is today in
[1:08:00] in Europe.
[1:08:02] And my brother-in-law, who is still
[1:08:04] smoking at the time before he was
[1:08:06] converted, took out a a cigarette
[1:08:08] package and he took out one cigarette
[1:08:10] and said, "Give give her a loaf of
[1:08:13] bread." and they gave her a loaf of
[1:08:15] bread and took the cigarette.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; The system's not very stable.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; And not very long ago, not very long
[1:08:30] ago, I came to this town which later and
[1:08:34] bought a little house that became the
[1:08:35] Cloverdale Bible Way House. It was
[1:08:38] $14,750.
[1:08:43] $14,750
[1:08:46] just when Cloverdale Bible Way started.
[1:08:49] We think we've saw things. Where does
[1:08:52] $14,000 go today? Nowhere,
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:58] I knew that you'd sit quiet, but I have
[1:09:00] a purpose in saying that. This is what
[1:09:03] Paul is talking about.
[1:09:05] It used to be that you could uh you
[1:09:10] could govern or gauge the increase of
[1:09:13] things and and and pretty well count on
[1:09:16] it. And if there was a growth of 4% or
[1:09:19] something in a person's business, that
[1:09:21] was very very nice. But you can't do
[1:09:24] that when things are bouncing all over
[1:09:27] the map and who's going to keep control
[1:09:29] of things and the price of things up and
[1:09:32] the price of things down. So the
[1:09:34] economic system is and the educational
[1:09:37] system uh uh is as is as things are
[1:09:43] moving. What about the policing and the
[1:09:45] justice system?
[1:09:47] I won't even get into it but it is it
[1:09:50] has dramatically
[1:09:53] changed dramatically changed.
[1:09:58] Wasn't very long ago in my lifetime,
[1:10:00] they took a criminal into court and had
[1:10:02] him pay a penalty.
[1:10:05] And until there's almost an uprising
[1:10:07] today, they take criminals and put them
[1:10:09] into court. And then they figure out a
[1:10:11] way to let them out.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; You know that's right.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; You know that's right.
[1:10:22] Somebody will take a man's life which is
[1:10:25] against the word of God. And we don't
[1:10:26] believe in that because our prophet said
[1:10:28] nobody has the right to take another
[1:10:30] man's life. But someone will take a
[1:10:32] man's life.
[1:10:34] I'm going to say something in a moment
[1:10:35] that you're maybe startle you. I only
[1:10:38] said it once over the pulpit before.
[1:10:41] Maybe maybe here. I can't recall, but I
[1:10:44] said at brother David McGary's church.
[1:10:47] And if any of his people hear this tape,
[1:10:49] they'll know that that was the first
[1:10:51] time I said it.
[1:10:54] But to take a man's life and get six or
[1:10:56] seven years
[1:10:57] or a few years for taking a person's
[1:10:59] life and changing it dramatically or
[1:11:02] getting drunk. Now, here's what the
[1:11:04] prophet of God said.
[1:11:07] If a man becomes intoxicated,
[1:11:11] he's doing that willingly. He's doing
[1:11:14] that knowingly. And he goes and gets
[1:11:16] behind the wheel of a car and drives
[1:11:19] down the highway and kills somebody. He
[1:11:22] said, "It's first-degree murder."
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; How did Brother Brandham die?
[1:11:30] By firstdegree murder.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; How did How did John the Baptist die?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; By firstdegree murder.
[1:11:47] Behold, the days come, says the Lord
[1:11:49] God, that I will send a famine in the
[1:11:52] land, not a famine of bread, nor of
[1:11:55] thirst for water, but of hearing the
[1:11:58] word of the Lord. And because there's a
[1:12:01] famine of hearing the word of the Lord,
[1:12:03] not a famine of Bibles,
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; not a famine of churches,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; not a famine of theological schools, but
[1:12:10] a famine of hearing the word of the Lord
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; because only God can give access to the
[1:12:15] word of the Lord.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; And then when he sends the word of the
[1:12:18] Lord and proves that it's him and proves
[1:12:21] that it's a prophet, all kinds of other
[1:12:23] prophets around have no proof
[1:12:25] whatsoever. But now here's one stands
[1:12:27] there and God comes behind it and speaks
[1:12:30] from heaven.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me? Speaks from
[1:12:35] heaven.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; And the reason why I I would say earlier
[1:12:38] I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself
[1:12:40] but when when the scripture which we
[1:12:42] read in our scripture reading says but
[1:12:44] see that you refuse not him that
[1:12:46] speaketh.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. And that word speaketh is to utter
[1:12:51] words such as I am speaking right now or
[1:12:54] making a sound that you understand and
[1:12:57] and other people could hear it. And and
[1:12:59] so that is uh see that refuse not him
[1:13:03] that speaketh. But then it says uh that
[1:13:09] for if they escape not not who refu for
[1:13:13] if they escape not who refused him that
[1:13:16] spake on earth much more shall not we
[1:13:19] escape if we turn away from him that
[1:13:21] speaketh from heaven whose voice then
[1:13:25] shook the earth. And the voice is is
[1:13:28] more than just uttering words. It can be
[1:13:30] uttering words but it is indicating and
[1:13:33] please follow me now
[1:13:36] whose voice it has a stronger a stronger
[1:13:40] depth of meaning because it it even uh
[1:13:44] it goes to the word it goes to the word
[1:13:47] of exposing oneself. In other words, if
[1:13:50] it's God that's speaking from heaven, he
[1:13:53] is simply saying, I am going to utter in
[1:13:56] such a way that you cannot mistake that
[1:13:59] it's me. And the only way he could make
[1:14:02] it known to you that it was him is that
[1:14:05] something would have to happen. And then
[1:14:07] the prophet of God comes and says many
[1:14:09] times that preaching is not just
[1:14:12] speaking or such as I'm doing. Preaching
[1:14:15] is demonstrating the power of that word.
[1:14:20] And so when Moses came, now just bear it
[1:14:23] out. This is a study. Now when Moses
[1:14:25] came, he uttered the words. He spoke. He
[1:14:28] said, "Let my people go." Pharaoh says,
[1:14:31] "Who are you? Who am I? I'm not going to
[1:14:34] let these people go." And then the
[1:14:36] plague started to come. He's a chief
[1:14:39] trick. So his magicians came did the
[1:14:41] same thing and did the same thing and
[1:14:44] did the same thing until the serpent was
[1:14:47] Aaron's rod was cast down become a snake
[1:14:49] and the serpent took up and and
[1:14:52] magicians of Egypt theirs became snake
[1:14:55] don't ask me how and then Aaron's
[1:14:57] swallowed theirs up and and so you know
[1:15:00] God is giving him edging him along to
[1:15:03] there's something more than just Moses
[1:15:06] saying some words here there's something
[1:15:09] from heaven coming. It's the
[1:15:11] supernatural. And it was the
[1:15:13] supernatural that begin. And finally, um
[1:15:16] uh Pharaoh would even call him say,
[1:15:18] "Pray to your God that that this will
[1:15:20] stop." And so he he'd pray and it would
[1:15:23] stop. And then and then Pharaoh, he he
[1:15:25] he he wasn't prepared to change. No, I
[1:15:28] won't let the people go. Then it came to
[1:15:31] boils. And the boils were so severe upon
[1:15:36] the people from the top of their head.
[1:15:39] Boils. And then the magicians of Egypt
[1:15:42] couldn't come and stand before Moses
[1:15:45] because they were completely covered
[1:15:47] with boils. And they were in such pain.
[1:15:50] They couldn't come to even try to repeat
[1:15:52] the boils. And so now things were moving
[1:15:55] and advancing to a point where man
[1:15:57] couldn't do anything. And and and God is
[1:16:00] trying to get Pharaoh. But Pharaoh's
[1:16:03] heart is comp continues to get hardened.
[1:16:06] And this also was the plan of God that
[1:16:08] he should harden his heart until until
[1:16:11] God would bring the final one, death.
[1:16:14] And then when all the animals and things
[1:16:17] died, even Moses, then Pharaoh called
[1:16:19] Moses and said, "I've sinned. I've
[1:16:22] sinned against you. I've sinned against
[1:16:25] God. Uh, and I repent and pray to God
[1:16:29] that go to your God and pray that this
[1:16:31] will change and that the death would and
[1:16:34] that things will change the hail and the
[1:16:37] locusts. Pray that these locust they've
[1:16:39] eaten everything that my people have for
[1:16:42] food. So Moses prayed, but then the
[1:16:44] Bible says and Pharaoh hardened his
[1:16:46] heart. Says, "I won't let them go until
[1:16:49] the last plague." And the last plague.
[1:16:52] So my my my my conclusion here for you
[1:16:56] is the plague, the supernatural power of
[1:17:00] God spoke louder than the words of
[1:17:04] Moses.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Understand?
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Say amen if you understand. So the Bible
[1:17:11] is saying now that was when a man spoke
[1:17:15] on earth and the voice was on earth and
[1:17:18] that was back in Moses time. But there
[1:17:21] will come a time and beware that you
[1:17:24] don't resist that voice
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; when one will speak and he'll speak from
[1:17:29] heaven.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; And there has never been a ministry on
[1:17:33] the face of the earth where man stood in
[1:17:35] public and revealed the secret of the
[1:17:38] heart of the people and cancers and
[1:17:41] healing and the death and the dumb and
[1:17:44] the marriages and the problems and the
[1:17:46] secrets of the hearts were revealed. And
[1:17:49] one spoke from heaven
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; by what I will call vindication.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; And the vindication was spoke louder,
[1:17:59] more profound, more emphatic, more clear
[1:18:03] than even the preaching of the word. So
[1:18:06] he could have preached uh a world
[1:18:08] falling apart or the token or all of
[1:18:10] these other things. But and when it came
[1:18:13] to the end and then God confirmed it,
[1:18:16] many people who had it confirmed to them
[1:18:20] still didn't believe what had been
[1:18:22] spoken. They missed the connection that
[1:18:25] the confirmation was confirming what had
[1:18:28] just been preached.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; And Moses finally, I mean, Pharaoh
[1:18:34] finally came to the conclusion, I've got
[1:18:38] to let his people go.
[1:18:42] That was the simple message. Let my
[1:18:45] people go.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; But he hardened his heart and finally
[1:18:49] when death came across the land and the
[1:18:52] food was gone and all of the the stink
[1:18:55] in the land because of all the cattle
[1:18:57] had died and all of this. Imagine
[1:19:00] someone being so proud, a leader of the
[1:19:03] great superpower of the earth at that
[1:19:05] time. Being so proud, I won't let them
[1:19:09] go. But in the end, it was God that
[1:19:12] spake
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; whose voice it wasn't just the speaking
[1:19:16] of Moses. Now, it was the voice of the
[1:19:19] power or the demonstration of those
[1:19:22] words.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And today, listen to me, friends. You
[1:19:26] read the books, but I'm here as a
[1:19:28] warning person this morning. What you
[1:19:30] read in those books are not just so many
[1:19:33] words. They shall come to pass. Amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; And they are coming to pass. And there's
[1:19:41] things that are happening in the world
[1:19:43] and things happening in America
[1:19:45] especially and in other places where the
[1:19:48] gospel of this message has gone and
[1:19:51] people have been healed and have
[1:19:53] experienced the supernatural, but
[1:19:55] they've hardened their heart and become
[1:19:57] carried away
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; with the things which the prophet of God
[1:20:01] has said we so seemingly enjoy
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; because they appeal to our modern way of
[1:20:10] life
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; and we seemingly enjoy them. We do enjoy
[1:20:15] them.
[1:20:16] But here's the warning. If we allow the
[1:20:20] things of this world
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; to begin to dominate us
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; begin to control us,
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; the author of the of this e evil age,
[1:20:32] listen to me. The author of this evil
[1:20:35] age is going to have you worshiping him.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; And worshiping him is simply being
[1:20:42] obese, doing obedience to him. What
[1:20:44] would you like? Well, I would like so
[1:20:46] that you cannot go to church. I would
[1:20:49] like so that you don't worship the true
[1:20:52] God. I want to try to prevent that. So,
[1:20:56] I have devised my system so that people
[1:21:00] have to run all over the map. They have
[1:21:03] to be. They have to be. And I'm not
[1:21:05] against I'm not against
[1:21:09] jobs. Not against education. Of course
[1:21:13] not. We have to have those things. We
[1:21:16] have to have them. But you must be the
[1:21:18] master of them.
[1:21:21] They cannot be the master of you
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; because the author of it has got things
[1:21:27] designed so that it will go contrary to
[1:21:31] the word of God.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; I'm ahead of myself. Is it all right?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; How about the economic system just for a
[1:21:50] moment? I just step back. In the Asian,
[1:21:53] African, and Latin American countries,
[1:21:57] well over 500
[1:22:00] million people
[1:22:02] are living in what the World Bank has
[1:22:04] called absolute poverty.
[1:22:08] Every year, 15 million children die
[1:22:13] from hunger.
[1:22:18] For the price of one missile,
[1:22:21] a school full of hungry children could
[1:22:23] eat lunch every day for five years.
[1:22:27] Something's haywire.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Something's haywire.
[1:22:33] We We've We've got money to fill the
[1:22:36] silos with missiles and put weapons on
[1:22:40] bombs and put them in submarines.
[1:22:45] I don't say we can fix it. I just say
[1:22:47] something's wrong.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; The World Health Organization estimates
[1:22:52] that onethird of the world is well-fed,
[1:22:55] one-third is underfed, and one-third is
[1:22:58] starving. Over 4 million will die this
[1:23:02] year.
[1:23:04] Throughout the 1990s, more than 100
[1:23:07] million children will die from illness
[1:23:11] and starvation. Those 100 million deaths
[1:23:14] could be prevented for the price of 10
[1:23:17] stealth bombers.
[1:23:20] 10 bombers.
[1:23:22] Canada right now is buying from the US a
[1:23:25] bunch of fighter jets of the latest for
[1:23:28] about $42 billion
[1:23:32] for the price of 10 stealth bomb stealth
[1:23:36] bombers or what the world spends on its
[1:23:39] military in two days.
[1:23:44] Nearly one in four people,
[1:23:46] 1.3 billion, a majority of humanity,
[1:23:52] live on less than $1 per day. While the
[1:23:55] world's 358 billionaires,
[1:23:59] have assets exceeding the combined
[1:24:01] annual incomes of countries with 45% of
[1:24:06] the world's people. It's according to
[1:24:08] UNICEF.
[1:24:12] Three billion people in the world today
[1:24:14] struggle to strive survive rather on $2
[1:24:18] a day. Every 3.6 seconds someone dies of
[1:24:22] hunger
[1:24:25] to satisfy the world's sanitation and
[1:24:29] food requirements
[1:24:31] would only cost us one 13 billion. what
[1:24:36] the people of the United States and the
[1:24:38] European Union spend on perfume each
[1:24:41] year.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:24:48] we're not going to go out there and fix
[1:24:49] it, but we have enough intelligence to
[1:24:52] say something's very wrong.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; And I want to be able to announce to you
[1:24:59] today according to the same word of God
[1:25:02] that God has promised another place.
[1:25:05] that's more real than this one
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; where this kind of statistics don't
[1:25:10] exist anymore.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't it a joy to know that we won't
[1:25:17] have any preacher stand up in the land
[1:25:20] across the river? And this is not pie in
[1:25:22] the sky. This isn't some heaven or happy
[1:25:25] hunting grounds. This is a reality.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; This is a place. That's why you're here
[1:25:33] in church this morning, to make your way
[1:25:36] to that land.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here.
[1:25:46] Now remember,
[1:25:50] now I want I I I I want to go back off
[1:25:52] of that.
[1:26:02] So there's abundant wealth on the earth.
[1:26:05] We're not short of that.
[1:26:08] And we talk about
[1:26:11] the scientific and the bringing more
[1:26:14] death and the religion and the systems.
[1:26:19] Now,
[1:26:26] refuse not him that speaketh.
[1:26:30] Now I I have already given you the
[1:26:32] distinction between the spoken words and
[1:26:34] the demonstration of power of God's
[1:26:37] vindicated words.
[1:26:40] I'm going to say some things that you
[1:26:42] just will have to absorb as we move
[1:26:44] along. I'm not going to preach because I
[1:26:47] don't want to lose my concentration of
[1:26:50] thought.
[1:26:52] It would be
[1:26:54] really uh unusual
[1:27:00] for us that have are seated here because
[1:27:04] you are here at least for the most part
[1:27:07] the people that I'm talking to
[1:27:10] because you've heard a message
[1:27:13] and I don't want to that word has been
[1:27:16] so uh uh abused and misused
[1:27:21] Uh the message to me the message is that
[1:27:24] God
[1:27:26] at a certain season at a certain time
[1:27:30] send a certain vessel with certain gifts
[1:27:34] certain
[1:27:35] made a certain way almost like a mystic
[1:27:38] almost like a neurotic almost like so
[1:27:42] sensitive one that could pass into the
[1:27:45] eternal realm and stand here on earth as
[1:27:48] Jesus said even the son of man who is in
[1:27:51] heaven while he stood on the earth. You
[1:27:54] can't get me convinced that anybody
[1:27:56] standing around him understood what he
[1:27:58] was saying. He was simply saying to the
[1:28:00] people, I'm here on earth. I'm also in
[1:28:02] heaven. Uh uh I'm because he was made
[1:28:07] that way. He was born that way. I'm
[1:28:10] speaking of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:12] Brother Brandon, the last messenger was
[1:28:15] that way for a purpose. So that you who
[1:28:18] say you believe it and you who say you
[1:28:20] understand it, that you might absorb
[1:28:23] this truth, God
[1:28:26] who saw that I would be birthed at a
[1:28:28] certain time, at a certain season,
[1:28:32] uh when certain events were taking place
[1:28:35] or had taken place and were taking
[1:28:37] place, God so we conclude that God saw
[1:28:41] that I would come here at this time
[1:28:44] and this God arranged that he would He's
[1:28:47] trying to tell you and and he's got a
[1:28:49] man standing here today saying to you
[1:28:52] and so God sent you a messenger. A
[1:28:55] messenger a messenger came like if
[1:28:57] someone came in the door and said say
[1:28:59] folks the man standing up there is just
[1:29:02] telling you that I would come. Well now
[1:29:04] I'm telling you that he has come and
[1:29:07] certain scriptures that were foretold
[1:29:09] that would happen uh have already
[1:29:12] happened. And one was Jesus who said,
[1:29:14] "Now, as it was in the days of Noah,
[1:29:18] they they married they married then,
[1:29:20] they've married all through history, but
[1:29:22] not like they handle it today. They're
[1:29:24] married today, they're not married
[1:29:26] tomorrow, they're married, you know,
[1:29:28] they go down to Vegas and get a divorce
[1:29:30] and then let's get married." And and do
[1:29:33] you know that right here in British
[1:29:34] Columbia,
[1:29:36] listen close, triple
[1:29:40] triple the number of people who get
[1:29:42] married or just living together because
[1:29:45] they don't trust the marriage union.
[1:29:49] Triple. That's just as of last week.
[1:29:53] three times more people saying let's
[1:29:57] just live together because they don't
[1:29:59] have confidence in the marriage system
[1:30:02] and it is this Satan's Eden the demons
[1:30:05] of hell and Satan himself who has made a
[1:30:09] mockery of marriage which is a holy holy
[1:30:12] institution he's made a mockery of it so
[1:30:15] that people say I don't want it
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; and here's the reason I don't want it
[1:30:19] they've made it so complicated they've
[1:30:21] made it so such a disgrace face. I don't
[1:30:24] want it. I have friends that have such a
[1:30:26] headache over it. I don't want it. And
[1:30:29] that's this age. And God knew we would
[1:30:32] be this. He sent you and I a messenger,
[1:30:35] a personal messenger. And the and the
[1:30:39] help me now. The ultimate of this
[1:30:42] messenger is to tell you and I to renew
[1:30:47] again the promise that God, our Lord
[1:30:52] Jesus Christ is going to select a
[1:30:55] people. And there's a people in fact is
[1:30:58] they're predestinated people. It's not
[1:31:01] just who, you know, it's not just a a
[1:31:05] wishy-washy thing. These have been
[1:31:07] predestinated. And he came to confirm
[1:31:10] you came from God. You didn't come just
[1:31:12] from mother and dad. You came from God.
[1:31:15] You did come from a seed, a human seed.
[1:31:18] But inside of you is another seed. Now,
[1:31:20] you know, you came from the seed of your
[1:31:22] father. But there's another seed, and
[1:31:24] it's a seed of our heavenly father who
[1:31:27] he called our heavenly parent. And that
[1:31:30] seed was in you and waiting for this
[1:31:32] word.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; You've been waiting for this. And that's
[1:31:38] why you tried this, you tried that,
[1:31:39] tried this church, that religion, you
[1:31:41] tried all of these various things and
[1:31:43] nothing fit. Nothing worked. Nothing
[1:31:46] answered to the soul. Now, the next
[1:31:49] person right beside you, maybe they
[1:31:50] didn't have that same call. They're
[1:31:52] happy. They're happy with it all. But
[1:31:54] there's people who are not. They say
[1:31:57] there's something else. There's
[1:31:58] something deeper. There's something more
[1:32:00] real. There's something more holy.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? You couldn't be
[1:32:07] satisfied with it. That because your
[1:32:10] heavenly father put something in there
[1:32:13] that nothing else could satisfy until
[1:32:16] his messenger walked in.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; God came in.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; You remember the last message
[1:32:25] correction. God just walked in.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; God just walked into your life. And
[1:32:30] there isn't any man, woman, or or spirit
[1:32:34] or anything on the globe that could
[1:32:36] change the reality of what happened to
[1:32:39] you.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, this I can't reconcile
[1:32:44] that." That might be you, but I don't
[1:32:46] have a problem with it.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; See, maybe I'll say something now that
[1:32:51] will help somebody. So people, they get
[1:32:54] technical with the message and say,
[1:32:56] "Well, he said this here and he said
[1:32:58] this over here and and this date doesn't
[1:33:02] fit that one and so on so forth." I I
[1:33:05] remember when I was a child, I was just
[1:33:08] a young person, my dad, and who's a
[1:33:10] really I won't say a scholar, but he was
[1:33:13] a student of the message of the of the
[1:33:15] not the message, but the scriptures all
[1:33:17] of his life. and and and there was huge
[1:33:21] discussion over how Jesus going by the
[1:33:24] scriptures and these are men who are
[1:33:26] scholars of the word how he could be
[1:33:28] three days and three nights because from
[1:33:30] Friday to Saturday and he got up Sunday
[1:33:32] morning and and and how did three days
[1:33:35] it doesn't seem to fit and and then the
[1:33:38] prophet comes along and I'm sitting with
[1:33:40] brother Brandham and he says well uh one
[1:33:42] place in the Bible says you shall make
[1:33:44] thou shalt make no grave an image
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; like to any likeness on earth or in
[1:33:49] heaven. And then he tells them just on
[1:33:52] down the line, you'll make two graven
[1:33:55] cherubams and he'll put them right over
[1:33:57] the mercy seat. How do you figure that
[1:34:00] one out? We don't figure it out. Listen,
[1:34:02] the message didn't come to interpret the
[1:34:05] message. The message didn't come to make
[1:34:07] this quote fit that quote or this quote
[1:34:10] to interpret that quote. You're on the
[1:34:12] wrong You're in the wrong channel. You
[1:34:15] got to switch channels. That isn't why
[1:34:17] it came. The message came. Jesus said in
[1:34:20] the days of Noah when they're marrying,
[1:34:23] giving and marriage and building and
[1:34:25] buying and economic stuff when all this
[1:34:28] is going on, that's the day I will be
[1:34:32] revealed again.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; And he sent a messenger to reveal Christ
[1:34:39] in the word. The message 11, 1200 tapes
[1:34:42] and all absolute. I tell you what,
[1:34:44] friends, it's the revelation
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; in that message because the message
[1:34:52] reveals Jesus Christ in the Bible.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; That and it's the it's the revelation
[1:34:59] that's perfect.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; It's the revelation that is perfect. Do
[1:35:05] you hear me? It's not that you get this
[1:35:07] word or that. Hey, you got people that
[1:35:10] are human. You got Moses that got angry
[1:35:13] and Moses lost his temper and whatever
[1:35:16] more. That doesn't interest me. He was
[1:35:18] God's prophet
[1:35:20] and God spoke to him and what he said
[1:35:24] came to pass and he fulfilled his part
[1:35:27] and he was sent to take a
[1:35:31] go out.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Did they go out?
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Then he was a true prophet. There's a
[1:35:37] people here. Another prophet's been
[1:35:40] sent. So that a people will go out
[1:35:43] [Applause]
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; and they shall go out. And that's why
[1:35:49] we're sitting here this morning to
[1:35:52] depart this iniquity to depart this
[1:35:55] injustice to depart this inequality of
[1:36:00] people. How can how can it it it it
[1:36:03] burdens my heart. I mean to tears almost
[1:36:06] when I think of children suffering with
[1:36:09] uh with distended stomachs and don't
[1:36:12] have food and we throw more away in the
[1:36:14] garbage. They'd love to live on your
[1:36:16] garbage.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Is that not the so?
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Is that not so?
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying anything fluffy. I'm not
[1:36:26] saying anything here to uh to have
[1:36:31] people agree with me, but I'm saying it
[1:36:33] because it happens to be truth.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying it because what you are
[1:36:38] seeing is the removal of those things
[1:36:42] that are made.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; That's what you're seeing. The removal
[1:36:47] of those things that are made.
[1:37:02] Now the voice is more than just a sound.
[1:37:06] It is actually an appearing and that's
[1:37:09] what I would like you to see. The voice
[1:37:12] is through the idea. And it says that
[1:37:15] they refuse not the voice. The voice is
[1:37:19] literally uh a a disclosure or making
[1:37:23] known of one's person. That's the
[1:37:26] purpose of the voice. So,
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; I'll put it in words that you understand
[1:37:32] very clearly.
[1:37:35] What the writer which is apostle Paul
[1:37:37] here is saying,
[1:37:40] the one that spoke on earth, don't
[1:37:43] refuse him that spoke. For if they
[1:37:46] refuse him,
[1:37:48] then he said, when the earth just shook,
[1:37:54] refuse not him that speaketh the voice
[1:37:57] of him or the disclosure of him.
[1:38:01] And it goes further, the exposure to
[1:38:05] expose himself. Now, now Jesus Christ
[1:38:09] when he was here, he was veiled in flesh
[1:38:12] and they couldn't they couldn't
[1:38:14] understand him. they they didn't
[1:38:15] understand him and they crucified him
[1:38:18] and so on. But now he's going to make
[1:38:20] himself even more unveiled. He's going
[1:38:24] to speak. In other words, don't miss the
[1:38:27] vindication.
[1:38:30] Don't miss the voice that actually
[1:38:33] exposes who it is. Amen.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Now, you I'm I'm I'm speaking a good
[1:38:40] deal of this message to people who know
[1:38:43] and are familiar with the ministry, the
[1:38:47] prophet's ministry. That is why
[1:38:51] that is why you hear him often refer to
[1:38:55] the pe when he's speaking to the people
[1:38:58] says that's not me.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; What's he saying? He's saying there's
[1:39:04] someone else here.
[1:39:07] He is simply being a tool so that you
[1:39:11] will feel and you already physically
[1:39:14] people including myself experienced and
[1:39:17] perhaps you have had the opportunity
[1:39:20] while the word is being preached
[1:39:22] something so penetrates you something so
[1:39:28] uh pierces the very inner being that you
[1:39:33] know that's not just the man standing
[1:39:36] behind the pulpit. There's another
[1:39:38] person here that is penetrating me so
[1:39:42] deeply. I can never ever I can never
[1:39:46] ever deny that that is a supernatural
[1:39:49] act of almighty God.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And the way to know whether it's an evil
[1:39:54] or a or a holy thing is which way it
[1:39:58] sends you.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; If it sends you away from God, it's not
[1:40:03] from God. if it sends you to God.
[1:40:07] Brother Brandham talks about people who
[1:40:09] are who are um
[1:40:12] astrologers,
[1:40:14] fortune tellers, etc., etc. But he says
[1:40:18] they don't preach the Bible. He didn't
[1:40:21] go out and say it doesn't work. Said
[1:40:23] some of them hit and miss and they, you
[1:40:25] know, whatever more. And I had an
[1:40:28] experience once which I'll just tell you
[1:40:30] about. there was a a a a soothsayer or a
[1:40:34] fortune teller just in the next block
[1:40:37] from where I worked. And uh
[1:40:41] so they had tried to persuade this uh
[1:40:44] young lady who was a cashier in the
[1:40:47] place where I was working and she was
[1:40:49] afraid to go because the people were
[1:40:51] coming back and saying it's it's it's
[1:40:53] incredible. she's just dead on. And uh
[1:40:58] and it's just incredible what she tells
[1:41:00] about the future. And so this uh girl
[1:41:04] said to me, she said, "Why don't you
[1:41:05] come with me?" You know, cuz she was
[1:41:08] afraid of herself, afraid to go alone.
[1:41:10] So I said, "Okay." And it just through
[1:41:13] the parking lot and another place there.
[1:41:16] And so she's sitting there and she takes
[1:41:18] a she takes the girl's hand and there's
[1:41:21] an older woman. She took this girl's
[1:41:23] hand and started telling all about her
[1:41:26] life, etc., etc. And uh
[1:41:30] so when we left, I said, "Well, how'd
[1:41:32] she do?" He said, "She said, "Oh," she
[1:41:34] said, "She wasn't right at all. The
[1:41:36] whole thing's haywire." I said, "Well,
[1:41:38] that's what that's what I told you it
[1:41:40] would be. They they don't have it."
[1:41:42] Brother Vanom didn't try to say that
[1:41:45] some of those don't tell the truth. and
[1:41:47] and there's people and then you get into
[1:41:49] the spiritual side of it into the
[1:41:52] religious side of it and where there
[1:41:54] people were uh uh uh you know I would
[1:41:59] say
[1:42:00] copying discernment and they would hit
[1:42:04] hit and miss and so on so forth. That is
[1:42:08] why and I'm bearing it down on this
[1:42:11] congregation.
[1:42:13] There has never never been a single
[1:42:17] account where that was a myth at the
[1:42:20] pulpit.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Why would God do that? Why would he do
[1:42:26] it with such a profound accuracy? So
[1:42:30] that when that messenger started to take
[1:42:32] this in his hand, you would know it
[1:42:35] would have the same degree of accuracy.
[1:42:37] Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; And so someone else rises up and say,
[1:42:42] "Well, technically this or technically
[1:42:44] that or someone else." I I haven't even
[1:42:46] got any time of the day to consider it
[1:42:48] because you have to consider who's
[1:42:50] speaking.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Who's who's raising up the question?
[1:42:56] Where is their vindication? So until you
[1:43:00] have this measure of vindication and
[1:43:02] this is what I'm saying apostle Paul is
[1:43:05] saying see that you refuse not this
[1:43:07] voice
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; don't refuse this voice which voice more
[1:43:14] than the uttered words you've got the
[1:43:16] messages in book form but the voice the
[1:43:19] profound voice of him who came from
[1:43:21] heaven and said what he's saying is the
[1:43:24] truth
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; I'm here to back it up That's right.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; So that to me is the I have called it
[1:43:36] the more profound voice which is a more
[1:43:40] profound sound. And I gave an example
[1:43:43] from Moses time and and now. And Paul
[1:43:47] said in Romans, so then faith cometh by
[1:43:50] hearing and hearing by the word of God.
[1:43:58] And the message has the Lord spoken only
[1:44:01] to Moses.
[1:44:04] And in there he said to demonstrate the
[1:44:07] power to demonstrate the power of God is
[1:44:11] preaching the gospel. To demonstrate the
[1:44:14] power of God. I say here to Cloverdale
[1:44:16] Bible Way and all who listen, we must
[1:44:19] not expect just to hear preaching.
[1:44:23] We must expect to hear the voice that
[1:44:26] spoke the promise of God. If two of you
[1:44:29] shall agree in anything uh according to
[1:44:33] his will, I will do it.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; I will do it.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Not just having to do with sickness, but
[1:44:42] having to do with many matters of life.
[1:44:44] I will do it
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; if you agree. And it's according to the
[1:44:47] word of God, according to the promise of
[1:44:50] God.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:52] in the message exhortation in divine
[1:44:55] healing. I'm trying to watch my time and
[1:44:58] be as careful as I can. I want to be a
[1:45:00] good boy today.
[1:45:03] He said, now that's his last words. He
[1:45:07] was taken up into heaven. Go into all
[1:45:10] the world and preach the gospel. And the
[1:45:13] gospel never comes by word only but
[1:45:17] through the power and demonstration of
[1:45:20] the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; We have to be able to see that God is
[1:45:24] amongst the people.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; The same God.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; You need to believe that.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced of it.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; I'm absolutely convinced of it.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; But we need to believe it together.
[1:45:36] Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; And the gospel never comes by word only
[1:45:42] but through the power and demonstration
[1:45:44] of the Holy Ghost. So it's to
[1:45:46] demonstrate the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:45:49] in our lives each one of each one of us
[1:45:54] now by the acting upon upon our faith.
[1:45:58] And now faith cometh by hearing and
[1:46:00] hearing the word of God. We have not
[1:46:03] just heard uttered words.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; And that is why oh God help me and help
[1:46:09] you to receive it. That is why in this
[1:46:12] advanced stage knowing all of the
[1:46:16] technical side of uh achievement, God
[1:46:20] would put it down on tape form
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; so that you can actually hear what it's
[1:46:26] like. You can hear the sound. You can
[1:46:29] hear the uttered words. And then you can
[1:46:32] hear God coming in behind it.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; And you can hear the messenger. Listen
[1:46:38] to the messenger saying, "That's not
[1:46:40] me."
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Then we the people saying, "Well, who is
[1:46:44] it?" He's saying, "That's Jesus Christ.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; That's not me. That's Jesus Christ." You
[1:46:50] see, if we get that firmly, firmly
[1:46:53] entrenched, I want it to be more than
[1:46:55] uttered words. I want it to be a
[1:46:56] revelation to you. I'm pulling for young
[1:46:59] and old in this congregation that that's
[1:47:02] a revelation. This word has come from
[1:47:05] Jesus Christ.
[1:47:19] for you, brother Kyle.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't miss it.
[1:47:25] The Holy Spirit,
[1:47:27] Christ is here."
[1:47:31] And I have to confess,
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; I probably missed it back then
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; because
[1:47:42] maybe too many questions or too many
[1:47:45] whatever elsees or maybe just the daily
[1:47:49] struggle of life.
[1:47:52] I can tell you when I heard this, I was
[1:47:56] just barely putting food on the table.
[1:47:58] He's saying don't miss this.
[1:48:02] The Holy Spirit Christ is here. He says
[1:48:05] now remember
[1:48:07] these two words before I leave you.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; The appearing of Christ and the coming
[1:48:16] of Christ are two different things.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Christ is now appearing in the fullness
[1:48:24] of his power.
[1:48:26] His
[1:48:29] coming will be afterwards.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; 1962.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; His appearing before the coming. He
[1:48:37] said, "God be merciful." And I want to
[1:48:40] say in public, "Thank God he was
[1:48:42] merciful to me.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Thank God he was merciful to my family.
[1:48:48] Thank God he's merciful to us here
[1:48:51] today.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm rejoicing in his mercy.
[1:48:56] Amen.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; We've seen him appear.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; We've heard a more profound voice than
[1:49:04] just the utterance of words that people
[1:49:07] debate about and and and have difficulty
[1:49:10] with. I have no difficulty with the
[1:49:12] message.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; I have no difficulty with the word of
[1:49:15] God.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Whether he was in the grave three days
[1:49:19] or three nights or how many hours or
[1:49:21] whatever more, what I'm concerned about
[1:49:24] and I believe he arose.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He arose victorious over
[1:49:31] death, hell, and the grave.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; And we can preach and we can come to
[1:49:36] church and be filled with such a uh such
[1:49:39] a confirmation.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to it, friends.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to this glorious truth.
[1:49:52] See that you refuse not this voice
[1:49:57] in works of faith expressed
[1:50:02] I'm saying just in brief
[1:50:05] he says and if I haven't told you the
[1:50:07] truth these things would not happen
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; but if I have told you the truth they
[1:50:15] bear record
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; that I've told you the truth.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; He's still the same yesterday, today,
[1:50:23] and forever.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; I like this congregation. You've heard
[1:50:26] it so many times, but let's say it
[1:50:28] together. Jesus Christ the same
[1:50:31] yesterday, today, and forever. Let us
[1:50:35] say amen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; We believe that.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; We give glory to you, Lord Jesus. You're
[1:50:43] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And the manifestation of his spirit
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; is catching away a bride.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if I've told you the
[1:50:55] truth,
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; and he's proven that he has,
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; and if I've told you the proof and the
[1:51:00] manifestation of his spirit is casting
[1:51:03] away your bride, let that faith in
[1:51:07] brackets revelation. Let that faith fall
[1:51:11] into your heart that this is the hour.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is the hour. My
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; I have to hurry quickly.
[1:51:30] seeing the removal of those things.
[1:51:33] And I ask what things? And you have a
[1:51:35] reason to ask what things.
[1:51:38] The scripture tells us in Revelation
[1:51:40] 13:8, "And all that dwell upon the earth
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; shall worship him
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; whose names are not written in the book
[1:51:51] of life of the lamb slain from the
[1:51:53] foundation of the world
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; in the resume of the church ages."
[1:52:00] And I wanted you to be able to read this
[1:52:02] with me.
[1:52:19] Um, just a little further back. I'll
[1:52:22] just hold that. Just shut that off a
[1:52:24] second. Would you please?
[1:52:26] I I want to just read this for you
[1:52:28] first.
[1:52:36] Brother Brennham speaks and he's saying
[1:52:38] now now what I'm speaking on that seeing
[1:52:40] the removal of those things. So it says
[1:52:43] the false church groups will come
[1:52:46] together in a world council of churches.
[1:52:50] And this world council of churches is
[1:52:53] the image erected to the beast.
[1:52:59] And I beheld another beast coming up out
[1:53:02] of the earth and he had two horns like a
[1:53:04] lamb. And brother Brandham then begins
[1:53:07] to read Revelation 13 uh 11-8.
[1:53:19] All right.
[1:53:26] Now I want you to read this with me. Now
[1:53:28] remember it was imperial pagan Rome. I'm
[1:53:32] not leaving my subject. So just read
[1:53:34] this along with me. It was imperial
[1:53:37] pagan Rome that fell by the sword. But
[1:53:40] she was healed of her death stroke when
[1:53:43] she joined to the nominal Christian
[1:53:46] church of Rome and incorporated paganism
[1:53:49] in Christianity and thereby became the
[1:53:52] Holy Roman Empire which was to endure
[1:53:55] until Jesus came and destroyed her. But
[1:53:59] Rome is not going it alone. her
[1:54:02] daughters are right with her and she
[1:54:07] will take over absolute authority by the
[1:54:11] world council of churches. That is a
[1:54:13] prophecy.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; So now we say well now how does that
[1:54:18] affect me? Well just follow along now
[1:54:21] closely.
[1:54:26] He says this may seem far-fetched
[1:54:30] at that time. It may seem far-fetched
[1:54:34] to some, but actually it is very plain
[1:54:37] for all to see. I'm speaking about
[1:54:40] seeing the removal of those things. What
[1:54:43] are we seeing? He's he just talking
[1:54:45] about a great council of churches etc.
[1:54:48] for all. He said it's very plain for all
[1:54:51] to see because right now the churches
[1:54:53] are controlling politics. We couldn't
[1:54:56] see that. A prophet could see that right
[1:54:58] now they are controlling politics and at
[1:55:02] the opportune time prophecy now will
[1:55:05] manifest. Exactly. How great is that
[1:55:09] control?
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; This ecumenical move will prophecy will
[1:55:15] end up with Rome at the head even though
[1:55:18] the people did not envision it that way.
[1:55:21] And the first meeting of the how many
[1:55:23] were alive still in 1948? How many
[1:55:26] people here were alive in 1948? Raise
[1:55:29] your hands. Just we're were we're were
[1:55:32] we're were almost in extinction.
[1:55:36] That was the first meeting of the World
[1:55:39] Council of Churches.
[1:55:41] And then for the next 30 years,
[1:55:44] Rome has only been 38, 48, 58, 68, 78.
[1:55:50] So how many now have have been born
[1:55:53] before 1978?
[1:55:57] Oh, see
[1:55:59] now to you this still a messenger. He
[1:56:03] was a messenger to all of us. But now it
[1:56:06] this me he said he said this may seem
[1:56:09] far-fetched. It may appear to be
[1:56:12] far-fetched but this is how they're
[1:56:14] going to take control. And the this
[1:56:16] ecumenical move will end up with Rome at
[1:56:19] the head even though the people did not
[1:56:21] envision it that way because Rome only
[1:56:25] sent an observer
[1:56:27] in 1948.
[1:56:30] But in the next 30 years
[1:56:33] they continued to send observers more
[1:56:36] observers more observers and then they
[1:56:39] began to sit on sit on committees and on
[1:56:42] panels and on that gradually taking more
[1:56:46] control. He said it wasn't envisioned
[1:56:48] that way but that's how it will happen
[1:56:51] and that is exactly and here's a prophet
[1:56:54] telling us he's telling this for a
[1:56:56] reason and I'm coming to it in just a
[1:56:58] moment. now
[1:57:01] and
[1:57:04] with this great power the church systems
[1:57:08] will persecute the true bride. This
[1:57:11] image will try to keep you might say,
[1:57:13] "Well, I don't see this great power."
[1:57:16] And you might not actually see the
[1:57:19] persecution, but you'll feel the
[1:57:22] pressure and you'll feel and it doesn't
[1:57:25] even know where it's coming from. And
[1:57:27] maybe legislation will be pa pasted at
[1:57:31] your government level and you have no
[1:57:33] idea. You do have an idea. If you hear
[1:57:36] what a prophet of God has said, you may
[1:57:39] see laws coming into place that take
[1:57:41] away certain liberties or take away uh
[1:57:45] uh those things happening and you don't
[1:57:47] know and you haven't any control over it
[1:57:50] and how people worship and and and and h
[1:57:54] how how a church can function and how it
[1:57:57] cannot function and and uh for me,
[1:58:01] brother Brandham talks about going and
[1:58:02] visiting in the hospital. we go and slip
[1:58:05] in the hospital to someone who has
[1:58:08] called for us or someone who's in ICU
[1:58:10] and I say I'm his pastor I'm a minister
[1:58:13] of the church and these brothers can go
[1:58:15] in but when it comes to the Siri
[1:58:17] hospital for example to be one who can
[1:58:20] go freely and do visitation amongst all
[1:58:23] the people you need to belong to the you
[1:58:26] need to belong to the council of
[1:58:27] ministers the council of churches if you
[1:58:30] belong to the world council of churches
[1:58:32] is your church, a member of the World
[1:58:36] Council of Churches, then you're free to
[1:58:38] do visitation throughout the hospital.
[1:58:40] If it's not, you don't have that
[1:58:42] freedom, then you have to go and and
[1:58:44] seek that acceptance or get that. Is it
[1:58:48] making some sense to you? It it's you
[1:58:51] say, well, what is the removal of those
[1:58:52] things? It it's exactly what the prophet
[1:58:55] of God said, and this isn't something
[1:58:57] new. This has been in place for years.
[1:58:59] And so it's a restriction on the bride
[1:59:01] of Jesus Christ from being able to go
[1:59:04] and minister to these people. And maybe
[1:59:06] that person right there, that may be a
[1:59:09] person that is actually elected that's
[1:59:12] in the hospital, but now Satan has
[1:59:14] arranged things that I can't actually
[1:59:16] get in there. But nevertheless, he will
[1:59:19] not lose one of them.
[1:59:21] And God who has control over life and
[1:59:24] over all of these things will preserve
[1:59:26] that person and bring them to a place
[1:59:29] where they will hear the message of the
[1:59:31] hour.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; I hope this is making sense to you.
[1:59:38] Her ministers will be forbidden to give
[1:59:40] comfort and truth to the people who need
[1:59:42] it. But before the antichrist in person
[1:59:44] takes over this complete world system of
[1:59:47] churches and true church, the true
[1:59:49] church uh will be taken away from this
[1:59:52] world to be with the Lord God uh to be
[1:59:55] with the Lord. The Lord God will catch
[1:59:58] away his bride for the great marriage
[2:00:00] supper of the lamb.
[2:00:06] Now,
[2:00:11] that's fine.
[2:00:15] Now, we come just a wee bit ahead. Give
[2:00:17] me another little bit of time, will you?
[2:00:22] The World Council of Church's general
[2:00:24] secretary. Now, we're going to just take
[2:00:26] a quantum leap into something.
[2:00:30] the World Council of Church's general
[2:00:32] secretary, Reverend Dr. Samuel Kobia.
[2:00:35] And incidentally, I'm always leerary
[2:00:37] about this doctor this and Dr. That
[2:00:39] because it's degrees. And someone said
[2:00:42] they just get colder by degrees.
[2:00:45] Anyway,
[2:00:47] he said in December 209. Okay. How many
[2:00:50] have been here that have been born since
[2:00:52] 209?
[2:00:54] From 209 up to 209. You're born prior to
[2:00:58] 209. Okay.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; So now I guess I'm speaking to most
[2:01:03] everybody and those who I'm not speaking
[2:01:05] to, they're in the cry room
[2:01:09] and that's where the mommy and the dad
[2:01:11] will have to teach them when they rise
[2:01:13] up and when they're at home and so on
[2:01:14] and so forth. So
[2:01:19] Samuel Kobia, this uh reverend doctor
[2:01:23] said in December 209,
[2:01:25] the endorsement,
[2:01:27] the endorsement by the patriarchs and
[2:01:30] heads of churches in Jerusalem.
[2:01:33] Oh, now we're coming home.
[2:01:39] It is called, and you could look it up
[2:01:41] if you wish. There's pages and pages and
[2:01:43] sites and sites on it. It's called the
[2:01:47] Kario
[2:01:50] Palestine document.
[2:01:52] K A R O S which is a Greek word which
[2:01:57] simply means seize the moment or the
[2:02:00] moment of truth. So sees the moment.
[2:02:04] This is sees the moment document or the
[2:02:06] document of truth. It adds it says and
[2:02:10] and this WWC WCC general assembly he's
[2:02:15] the he's the general secretary of the
[2:02:18] world council of churches he has said
[2:02:20] that this document adds integrity
[2:02:24] and authority
[2:02:26] and force to the message of the document
[2:02:29] to have these caliber of men bringing it
[2:02:33] forward for endorsement by the world
[2:02:35] council of churches.
[2:02:37] He said it calls for
[2:02:41] an end to the Israeli occupation of
[2:02:44] Palestine land and for the boycott of
[2:02:47] Israel.
[2:02:49] This is what this document is calling
[2:02:51] for. And the Kario Palestine in December
[2:02:55] 209
[2:02:57] prominent Palestinian Christian leaders
[2:03:01] released the Kario Palestine document
[2:03:04] called a moment of truth. And the
[2:03:07] document declares
[2:03:09] the Israel occupation of Palestine is,
[2:03:13] are you listening now? in 212. This from
[2:03:16] 209, 36 months ago. This document calls
[2:03:23] the occupation of Palestine.
[2:03:27] In other words, the Jewish people in the
[2:03:31] land that God spoke
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; and said, "I give it to you."
[2:03:36] Now another voice is speaking
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; at the highest level and accepting a
[2:03:42] document which says that their
[2:03:45] occupation of this land is quote a sin
[2:03:50] against God
[2:03:55] and against humanity.
[2:03:59] It calls on churches and Christians all
[2:04:02] over the world to consider it and adopt
[2:04:05] it and to call for the boycott of Israel
[2:04:09] and that peoples all over the world
[2:04:11] shall boycott. And they said if they
[2:04:14] shall isolate Israel then it will put
[2:04:17] sufficient pressure on them to give this
[2:04:20] land back. Land that God gave them.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Land which they say I cannot give it
[2:04:26] back. And they are on one side is the
[2:04:30] Neabboth and on the other side is the
[2:04:32] Ahab.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; And you people
[2:04:40] have had a prophet, a messenger
[2:04:44] to you
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; that said these are the things that are
[2:04:50] going to happen and they will take
[2:04:52] control even though it doesn't seem like
[2:04:55] it.
[2:04:57] So what does it mean to us? Why are you
[2:05:00] saying these things? Brother Biscll,
[2:05:01] listen. This is why I'm saying it. You
[2:05:04] have witnessed and are witnessing the
[2:05:07] loosening of these things
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; where the that many churches are caught
[2:05:12] in it because they want to be part of
[2:05:15] this world system and on the basis we
[2:05:19] want to do some good. We feel we have
[2:05:21] more influence if we're part of it. But
[2:05:24] they don't realize that they're being
[2:05:25] sucked down the abyss.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says they'll wake up and
[2:05:31] they will have already taken the mark of
[2:05:33] the beast.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Cloverdale, by the way,
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; you don't know how privileged you are to
[2:05:40] know that this message has prevented you
[2:05:43] from taking that mark.
[2:05:45] [Applause]
[2:05:50] And you that are sitting here that are
[2:05:51] young, perhaps you haven't seen the
[2:05:54] trail of this thing. I happen to live
[2:05:56] before 1948 and saw the great revival
[2:05:59] that was taking place. And if you ask me
[2:06:01] today, did you ever ever think that
[2:06:05] those people in churches that were
[2:06:07] having such an anointing and being so
[2:06:09] swept away in the supernatural would
[2:06:12] ever come to this? Never.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Never could even dream that it would.
[2:06:17] Excuse me for being as as brazen as I
[2:06:20] am, but I'll tell you, there's one Satan
[2:06:23] that's much more brazen. How brazen is
[2:06:25] he? He would come even to the Lord Jesus
[2:06:29] Christ, my Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; To the one who actually allowed Lucifer
[2:06:36] to have life.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; For the scripture says, "All things were
[2:06:39] made by him, and without him was nothing
[2:06:42] made that is made."
[2:06:44] and that Lucifer should say to him,
[2:06:47] "Fall down and worship me."
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I have no space for
[2:06:52] that creature whatsoever. I cannot wait
[2:06:55] and I want a ringside seat when he's
[2:06:57] cast into the lake of fire. And he
[2:07:00] surely shall be. It's been created for
[2:07:02] the devil and his angels. And we are a
[2:07:05] privileged people of the earth. We're an
[2:07:07] Exodus people.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Prophet has called you an Exodus people.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. people ready to move out.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you. I I have so much
[2:07:22] more that I have to say I'll have to
[2:07:24] take it at another time.
[2:07:29] I can tell you if it wasn't for this
[2:07:30] message, where would you be?
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Where would we be?
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; We'd be caught in some trap.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; We'd be caught in some snare. That's
[2:07:39] right.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't even know how to be baptized
[2:07:41] in the water.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; And and the prophet of God said that
[2:07:45] that the baptism and the trinity
[2:07:48] doctrine is what will link all of the
[2:07:50] daughters to the mother church. And
[2:07:52] that's exactly what it is. Exactly what
[2:07:55] it is. Oh, thank God. I am free. Free.
[2:07:58] Free from this world of sin. Sin being
[2:08:02] unbelief.
[2:08:04] Born and bought by the blood of Jesus
[2:08:06] Christ. Hallelujah. Let's stand to our
[2:08:09] feet, please. Thank you for your time.
[2:08:17] Father,
[2:08:21] I trust
[2:08:24] these words to the Holy Spirit, to the
[2:08:28] safekeeping of the Holy Ghost, and that
[2:08:31] you will take them and plant them, Lord,
[2:08:34] as I felt in my heart for the days that
[2:08:37] lie ahead and for the future time. and
[2:08:41] that those that have not perhaps lived
[2:08:44] the span of time that I have or observed
[2:08:47] the things that I have or your prophet
[2:08:50] has laid out so clearly. I pray you'll
[2:08:53] help us Lord to put these things
[2:08:55] together that they may rejoice that they
[2:08:58] may know God that you have watched over
[2:09:01] your heritage. You have watched over
[2:09:03] those that are yours. Father in the name
[2:09:06] of Jesus Christ, we want Satan to know
[2:09:09] that we defy him.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; We deny him any right. We deny him any
[2:09:15] place amongst the congregation. There
[2:09:18] may be those Lord who are not well. And
[2:09:21] this uh whole epidemic of flu which has
[2:09:24] gone around the country. In the name of
[2:09:26] Jesus Christ, you have said that we can
[2:09:29] claim our promises and we say that they
[2:09:33] are yay and amen to everyone that
[2:09:36] believeth and we believe them Lord.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; And I stand here victorious through
[2:09:42] Jesus Christ over the enemy. Hallelujah.
[2:09:46] Hallelujah. As any sick and afflicted,
[2:09:49] let them call. And just now we pray over
[2:09:51] those that may be sick and afflicted.
[2:09:54] Father, I pray that as people raise
[2:09:56] their hand and say in the name of Jesus
[2:09:59] Christ, I am free from all that this
[2:10:01] world will impose upon me, whatever it
[2:10:04] might be and in whatever form it might
[2:10:06] be for those that may be in financial
[2:10:09] distress in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:10:12] Turn circumstances around, oh God, and
[2:10:15] let the people know they need to be
[2:10:17] diligent in these hours, wise as
[2:10:19] serpents and harmless as doves. I pray,
[2:10:22] oh God, let the Holy Spirit, you know
[2:10:26] how I prayed, how I desire that you will
[2:10:28] manifest your word to these people and
[2:10:31] in them and through them in Jesus name.
[2:10:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank God I am
[2:10:38] free. Free. Free.
[2:10:42] Let's sing it together.
[2:10:46] Thank you, brother Ryan. I need you.
[2:10:50] free
[2:10:53] from this world of sin
[2:10:58] and then I want the blood Jesus and born
[2:11:02] again.
[2:11:06] Hallelujah. I save
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:10] my wonderful praise.
[2:11:15] I'm glad I found out he could wake me up
[2:11:20] slowly away.
[2:11:24] For a long time I tra
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:32] my heart was so heavy.
[2:11:36] [Music]
[2:11:39] Then I heard about Jesus.
[2:11:44] What a wonderful hour.
[2:11:49] I
[2:11:51] can bring me out with saving power
[2:11:59] [Music]
[2:12:01] of this world
[2:12:06] in the blood of Jesus
[2:12:10] for
[2:12:11] [Music]
[2:12:13] hallelujah. God save
[2:12:18] my
[2:12:19] way.
[2:12:22] I'm glad I found out
[2:12:26] [Applause]
[2:12:28] the way.
[2:12:29] [Music]
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Like a bird out of prison.
[2:12:35] [Music]
[2:12:40] like a blind man that

[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Oh
[2:13:04] my god. I am free.
[2:13:07] I'm free from this world of sin.
[2:13:12] You were ones
[2:13:15] Jesus
[2:13:17] born again.
[2:13:20] Oh hallelujah.
[2:13:22] Hallelujah.
[2:13:24] Hallelujah.
[2:13:34] Show me the way.
[2:13:36] [Music]
[2:13:38] Hallelujah.
[2:13:40] Hallelujah.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Wonderful to be free, friends.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; We're just here for a very brief time.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Then we're going to be gone.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; We're seeking out the last one now.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you for your faithfulness.
[2:14:02] God bless you for your prayers and for
[2:14:05] your giving and your support and all of
[2:14:07] these things. God bless you.
[2:14:13] God bless the Sunday school. Teach them,
[2:14:16] Brother Richard. You and the teachers.
[2:14:19] God bless the school.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Teach them.
[2:14:23] Teach them.
[2:14:25] Parents,
[2:14:27] teach them what this me teach them. Tell
[2:14:30] them
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; what this message is all about.
[2:14:37] Personally,
[2:14:39] I tell you what, friends, the more I
[2:14:42] delve into it, the richer the richer it
[2:14:45] is, the more glorious it is. I urge you,
[2:14:48] I'd just like to have a whole
[2:14:49] congregation just urge you to just
[2:14:53] saturate yourself.
[2:14:55] Hallelujah.
[2:14:57] I like this. I'd like also to sing the
[2:15:00] great emancipator.
[2:15:01] And to all of you, I want to say don't
[2:15:04] don't just sing it as a song because
[2:15:06] someone's up here. Sing it. It's you.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Like a lost lamb, I was drifting. I was
[2:15:13] wandering. You're that lost lamb. And he
[2:15:16] found you. This is a time to rejoice.
[2:15:20] This is a time to say, "It's wonderful.
[2:15:23] Hallelujah.
[2:15:26] Hallelujah. Once my heart and soul was
[2:15:28] fettered, then the tom will come and
[2:15:30] close it. Bless you in prayer.
[2:15:37] My heart and soul.
[2:15:41] Yes.
[2:15:44] And by
[2:15:46] the mighty take
[2:15:50] [Music]
[2:15:52] for
[2:15:54] the brave master.
[2:15:59] [Music]
[2:16:00] He set
[2:16:02] me free. Worship him. Worship him.
[2:16:10] Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[2:16:17] Blessed be the earth.
[2:16:21] Holy name,
[2:16:25] [Music]
[2:16:32] Lord.
[2:16:34] And that's
[2:16:36] the song of the
[2:16:41] [Music]
[2:16:42] And I
[2:16:44] also
[2:16:49] Yes, I know.
[2:16:54] and
[2:16:57] [Music]
[2:17:01] the seeking shepherd found
[2:17:06] and he led
[2:17:09] you to my father.
[2:17:12] Glory, glory, glory, glory,
[2:17:17] glory,
[2:17:19] hallelujah.
[2:17:23] Blessed be
[2:17:26] his holy name.
[2:17:31] I don't need
[2:17:33] the great
[2:17:40] and
[2:17:42] the song of Sing it one more time.
[2:17:46] Glory, glory, glory,
[2:17:50] glory
[2:17:54] to God.
[2:17:56] Oh, blessed
[2:17:58] be his holy name.
[2:18:04] For he's
[2:18:06] the great man today,
[2:18:10] Lord.
[2:18:12] and that's
[2:18:14] the song of the redeeing.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; We indeed thank you.
[2:18:29] We worship you this morning.
[2:18:31] We have heard the word.
[2:18:34] And Lord, it has found an entrance into
[2:18:37] our hearts this morning.
[2:18:40] Father, a voice of warning,
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; a voice of comfort.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus, you once spoke and said there
[2:18:49] would be a time when Jerusalem would be
[2:18:51] encompassed about. That was a voice of
[2:18:53] warning, but it was a voice of comfort
[2:18:56] to the redeemable, Lord. And then
[2:18:59] Josephus comes behind and tells a world
[2:19:02] that not one that followed Jesus was
[2:19:05] caught in Titus snare. And Lord, there's
[2:19:08] not one that's going to be caught behind
[2:19:11] in this trumpet of this revelation of
[2:19:14] this rapture message that has come forth
[2:19:17] today. Lord, we're thankful that we have
[2:19:20] a watchman on the tower. We have a
[2:19:22] God-given ministry, Lord, that can see
[2:19:24] afar. We're thankful for a voice that
[2:19:27] has come in this generation. And Lord,
[2:19:30] all we want to do is thunder forth the
[2:19:32] very voice of God what already has been
[2:19:35] spoken.
[2:19:37] Thankful for brother Bisco. Thankful for
[2:19:39] a servant of Christ. We're thankful for
[2:19:41] a pastor, a shepherd that's willing,
[2:19:44] Lord, to step in the gap, stand there
[2:19:47] and proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2:19:50] Father, we'll return tonight if it be
[2:19:52] your will. And brother John Andy's will
[2:19:54] speak and we're so looking forward to
[2:19:56] it. You've brought him back and Lord,
[2:19:58] with a great report, we just pray that
[2:20:00] you will use him also in a very special
[2:20:03] and wonderful way. May we return with
[2:20:05] our hearts still burning in us as you
[2:20:08] have spoken to us this morning. Go with
[2:20:10] us now under your great
