Welcome to the house of the Lord this morning in anticipation of a wonderful day." &gt;&gt; Amen. We've we've come. We've gathered. We were praying in this study just a few moments ago and had a picture of shepherds laying down their staffs, gathering their little flocks of sheep, and the shepherd spoke to them. I say, "Oh, great shepherd this morning, come and speak to us this morning, Lord." Let's sing together. Oh, come all ye faithful. Number 788 on the screen. Quite a few things happening this morning.

Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. take an opportunity to pray over several prayer requests. Ask Brother Darren Hoffman if you'd come this morning and take the needs before the Lord. We're also going to have the deacons come and receive the morning tithes and offerings if the deacons would come as you give unto the Lord this morning. I believe brother Darren has a comment or two to say uh just before the end of the year as a trustee regarding tithes and offerings. But I do want to mention these requests before the congregation this morning. Brother Jean Commandanda, he says, "My brother's son Eric, he was taken to the hospital this morning in central Africa. We do not know the problem at this time, but please pray for a complete healing." Brother Ben Charman, please pray for Tina Rutder. She overdosed and is in the hospital and they haven't been able to get her to wake up at this time. Brother Norm Wood requests that we pray for brother Sam Waldner. Many of you may know this already. Uh he was admitted to the hospital last night and was diagnosed with a mild heart attack. So we want to remember brother Sam this morning. We have a testimony from Sister Eleanor Drake regarding William Drake. He wants to thank all who prayed for him. He is thankful that he did not lose his legs or that the truck he was in didn't go over into the water from the bridge that he was on. He had surgery on his legs and came home yesterday from the hospital in a wheelchair. He has a long recovery period ahead. Please keep him in prayer for a complete healing and that he will commit his heart and his life to Jesus Christ. Amen. Now, Brother Darren, why don't you come this morning? Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, where you are gathered here this morning, Lord Jesus, to remember the one that came, the one that took on human flesh that could fulfill the law, dear Lord Jesus. And by your death, by the shedding of the blood, you remitted our sins, Lord God. That blood was shed on Calvary, dear God, that each one of us could be free. free and delivered from every affliction, Lord, every disease, every trial, dear God. Lord Jesus, you purchased it all when you said, "It is finished, Father." So, Lord Jesus, we're claiming the promises this morning, Father. It's already done. It's already finished, Lord Jesus. Father, ones that need healing in our body, dear God. Lord, ones that need uh deliverance, dear God, from demons, Father. How we put our hands upon these prayer requests, Lord Jesus. Each need you know of, dear God. You know how just to deal with each situation, Father. So, we're commending each one to you, Lord God. That you'd strengthen those that are weak. That you deliver those that are bound, dear God. Lord Jesus, you'd speak to the hearts, Lord Jesus. Open the eyes of the blind. Heavenly Father, for we are a needy people, Lord Jesus. Lord God, we so thank you that we serve a a true and risen savior. The God that hears and answers our prayers, Lord. So we commit ourselves into your hands, Lord God, that your will would be done. That you would do the miracles, Lord. You would do the great things, Lord Jesus, in our lives. That we could just stand still and see the glory of God in our midst. Lord Jesus, we want to remember, Lord, the service this morning, dear God, that you'd speak to our hearts, Lord, and we would just enter in, Father. we would just receive all that you have for us that we would recognize our position in Christ, Lord, and walk in these promises. We just so thank you, Lord. Just ask your blessings upon each one, those on the internet, Lord. Those with hands raised, hearts raised to you, Lord Jesus. You see the need. You see the desire, dear God. Lord, you hear the groaning within our hearts, Lord. We so thank you for that, Lord. When we fail to have words to utter, you know our hearts, Lord, and we so love you. you're so mindful of us, Lord. Oh, that you're so attentive to our prayers. Be with us now, Father. Lord Jesus, also just asking that you would just um bless the people now, Lord, in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Uh so, just before we take up the offering, I figured I'd make the announcements first because one time when I did it, made an announcement, everybody was busy. Nobody really heard what I had to say. So this time we'll just if the brothers can just hold on there for a minute. Um it's the end of the year again. Uh just about another week and we'll be into a new year 2013. So regarding your your tithes and your offerings uh just have a few points for just remind everyone. We just want to make sure that everyone's aware of these things. Uh first of all, if you want uh your donations to be part of your 2012 donation receipt, we have to receive your donations, whether it's ti or your offerings, uh no later than December 31st, which is watch night. If you're if you're making it out by check, make sure it's dated no later than December 31st. Otherwise, we can't give it to you for we can't apply that to this year's donation receipt. Um, also, so for your donations, uh, for the Americans, you probably want a US donation receipt. So, your donation should be made payable to Bible believers of Washington. And if you're a Canadian, you probably want a Canadian donation receipt. So, make your checks payable to Cloverdale Bible Way. Now, um if if anybody forgets, um ask me or ask one of the deac or trustees or a lot of people probably already know those things. Um the other thing is we just want to make it make it clear about uh the offerings that we take up in the morning. These offerings aren't to replace what we've already established in the past with our with our tithe box in the uh foyer or many of us will pay by credit card or by debit card at the office during the day. uh this is not to replace that. This is just to give opportunity for those who aren't accustomed maybe to to giving an offering to the Lord. Um or if you just, you know, you just didn't have time to get into the office or the tithe box. So, we just want to make this uh an opportunity for you to give of your offerings. This is not your tithes. This is your offerings. I mean, you can put your tithe envelope, if you have a tithe envelope, put it in there if you'd like, but this is we're collecting ties, which is going to um help to pay for the building and all the associated costs. Um, so I think I've covered everything. And we do have envelopes in the back there on the on the tithing box. So, if you want to put your cash in the envelope so we know who it is so that we can then attribute that to your donation receipt, then by all means do that or just drop your cash, whatever you want, into the offering um bucket, whichever way you want to do it. So, I just want to make it so that it's easy for everyone to give. So, uh let's just bow our heads now for the the offering. Heavenly Father, we want to thank you, Lord Jesus, for this place. Father, you said as you see the day approaching to gather yourself so much more together. And Lord Jesus, you've been faithful to us and you've provided a place for us to gather that we could be under the sounding of the gospel. So Lord Jesus, we just want to be able to give back a little bit, Lord, what you've so poured into our lives, Lord Jesus, to support, Lord God, this this uh the church, Lord Jesus, all that it does. Father, we just ask that you bless the people, Lord, as they would give. We know that it's a it's a difficult time, Lord. many many ones in financial distress, Lord. But Father, even the woman that gave two months, Lord, she you said she gave more than all the rest because she gave of her of her whole living, Lord, we may not be able to give much, Lord, but you see what we do give. And Lord Jesus, you'll bless those that give. Give from their hearts, Lord. Give willingly, Father. Lord Jesus, we so thank you. We ask that you bless each person they would give now. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Thanks, brother Darren. As the deacons are receiving the morning tithes and offerings, God bless you. Maybe we can sing together. The children are going to get ready to come in just now, but we can just stand for a few more moments. Joy to the world. Joy to the world. The Lord is come. Let earth receive her king. Let every heart prepare him. And heaven and nature sing. And heaven and nature sing. And heaven and heaven and nature sing. He to the world the Savior reign. Let men their songs employ while fields and flood rocks hills and plain repeat the sounding joy repeat the sounding joy. Repeat repeat the sounding joy. Oh foolless sin and sorrows praise your soul in the ground. He comes to his place. Far as the curse is found. Far as the curse is found. Far as far as the curse is found. He rules the world with truth and grace and makes the nations prove the glories of his rightousness and wonders of his love and wonders of his love and wonderers of his love. Amen. Why don't you have your seats this morning? Silent night, holy night. All is all right. Your burden mother and child in so tender and love. Sleep with heavenly peace. Peace in heavenly way in a manger for a man. The little Lord that lay down his sweet hair. The star In a bright spot where he laid, the little Lord Jesus has name on the day. Away in a manger no for a bed. The little Lord Jesus lay down things we made. In the bright sky, look down where he lay. The little Lord he lets us sleep on the day. for the herald angels sing. Glory to the newborn king. We are the earth bright and heaven of the sky and it was bright morning the heralding. Angels sing glory to the king it on over the hill and everywhere it Jesus Christ is Oh go over the hill and everywhere that Jesus Christ might be Let me let me &gt;&gt; morning. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Wonderful children. &gt;&gt; Very, very wonderful and very appropriate. And uh we have an announcement we'd like to make this morning. I was hand handed this note. And I just thought as as the children were singing, it wasn't too many years ago that a couple of young people were standing on the steps. So there's an announcement to be made. It's a special announcement. and brother Ron and sister Star Caldwell along with brother John and sister Sharon Andes they've got here in Capitol are thrilled to announce &gt;&gt; theater and sister Jack are getting Amen. Go tell it on the mountain. Also, I guess we should uh the engagement of Sister Jessica Caldwell and brother Timothy Andes. Amen. And the crowd goes wild apparently. God bless you. And just one last announcement, because there is no service on Wednesday, we will be having a fellowship night on Friday night at 7:00. And that will just be uh the sisters will have some uh desserts and coffees and stuff that's prepared for us. It's a nice evening time of fellowship. You're all welcome. And uh we make it available because some uh are away with their families and some are still home here in Cloverdale and we just like to have a nice evening. So all is welcome Friday night at 7:00 here in the fellowship room. God bless you. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Can we give them a hand as they go? see the bright light shine. Amen. Maybe we can sing together. We've got a baby dedication this morning. Sister Brianna is going to come and uh sing a special just as we're preparing for that. Brother Jay and Sister Grace Bey are going to have their little one dedicated this morning. Let's sing together. &gt;&gt; It's shining before me. Someone standing at the open door. Oh, I can see the river. And I know it'll be forever. Lord, I've never been before. I can see my father standing at the door. Oh, I'm ready for deliverance. Oh Lord, I've never been before. I can't see. I can see that holy grail. No one will be able. Oh my heart. You spread my wings. Lord, I've never been there before my life. It's just about time. I can see my father standing at the door of the wilderness. I'm ready for the living. Lord, I've never been born. Oh, what a day. What a day that will be to save the victory. Walking through those gates where oh we see one another. Every sister, every brother, Lord, I've never been there before. Oh, let's come together now. I can see my father as I hallelujah. Amen. Our Father, in heaven. How will be thy name? Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. For thine is the kingom. Thine is the power and the glory forever forever. Amen. Give us, Lord, give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us, forgive us, Lord. Forgive us of our debt. For thine is the kingom. Thine is the power and the glory forever. Forever. Amen. Lead us from temptation. Lead us from temptation. But deliver us. Deliver us from evil to thy salvation. For thine is the kingom. Thine is the power and the glory forever. Amen. is the kingom. Th is the power and the glory forever. Forever. Amen. Grace, she's going to sing the chorus just a couple more times as our pastor's coming this morning. Sounds beautiful, doesn't it? Amen. I just want to hear it just a couple more times as they're getting ready. &gt;&gt; For is the kingom. Thine is the power and the glory forever. Forever. Amen. For thine is the kingom. Thine is the power and the gloryy forever. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We agree with that, don't we? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. And our brother Jay and Sister Grace Bey, uh they're holding a new family. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're happy for them. You happy, Brother Jay? You're happy. It's all right. &gt;&gt; I guess I should ask you, Sister Gracie. It doesn't look like they're uh suffering uh from malnutrition. They're doing real well. Well, uh, our brother Jay and sister Grace, uh, wanted to dedicate their child today, and I thought it was so appropriate, uh, the giving of gifts. The world will be taken up and is so taken up with it. But God decided to give them a gift &gt;&gt; and give them another gift. And I don't know how many more gifts But anyway, brother Jay and Sister Gracie just decided to give him back to God. And I think that's a good idea, too. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Uh he received this priceless gift, Brother Jade, Sister Grace, this son perhaps unexpectedly. &gt;&gt; Yes. and uh are asking now for divine wisdom to guide and train this child. Uh they've called him Daniel and Judah. Daniel Judah. Uh I I was thinking now for 2 three days about this and I thought that uh I'm going to be praying that God will give us a Daniel and if time should go on that he would be what we all identify Daniel as a man of prayer. A man who was unashamed to pray. A man who was unashamed to give his life in humility. And also in the midst of uh being lifted up, he himself was not lifted up. He he took whatever whatever was happening. He just took it. And uh even though they made a great statue and in honor of him and heaped honor on him, he wouldn't eat the king's bread. He wanted to live a simple life. And then when he was praying, he prayed and opened up the window. And when he was uh re when he was persecuted and cast into the dungeon with the lions, he still trusted that same God. And then brother Jay said that uh he recalls me speaking about Judah and the threat to the seed line and they decided to give him that name as well, Daniel Judah. And I want to say to you, brother Jay and Sister Gracie, that uh Judah was a remarkable a remarkable person himself. And that in that he interceded. He was the one who interceded. And I just do not know the full depths of the spiritual ramifications of this scripture, but he interceded for Benjamin. And we know that Benjamin according to the prophet's message is that 144,000 that remnant. And he interceded to Joseph. And Joseph was a perfect type of Christ. and he didn't know him. But he interceded to Joseph that he would that he would allow Benjamin to re to let him be in hisstead instead of Benjamin because he said and and his thought was completely not for himself but for his father especially for his father which was aged and he said my father will go down to the grave with his gray hairs if he doesn't have Benjamin. I had two brothers and here he's talking to the one. He didn't know it. And so there's some I'm just praying that the spirit of uh intercession and the spirit of prayer will be upon this child. And the Bible says I'm going to say this in closing. The secret the scripture you know well the secret things belong unto the Lord our God. But those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children. &gt;&gt; And I would never want you to forget that the things that God has revealed to you and made known to you in this message belong to these children. &gt;&gt; And that you'll teach them in it and show them the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're dedicate them in the name of the Lord. Daniel, Judah, here you are. Hallelujah. We'll pray together. Heavenly Father, as I hold this gem, this child, this son that you gave to our brother Jay and Sister Grace, you gave him as a gift and now they're asking, Father, that you will receive receive what's in their hearts to return him to your service and to return him to your work and to return him, oh God, to your care and your keeping. May your Holy Spirit be upon him and illuminate him. Father, I pray, Father, that you'll keep him in good health and strength. I pray you'll put, oh God, a spirit of God upon him, that he will feel uh he will feel a hunger and a desire for you. I pray, dear Lord Jesus, and he hears your name, that he will respond to it so quickly. May the spirit of God be upon him. We dedicate Lord Daniel Judah in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sing amen. God bless you, brother J. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Is that it? I said that's it. &gt;&gt; Here we are. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Congratulations to the brother Tim and and uh sister Jessica. Yes, it is. I I'm I'm afraid of sometimes saying names in case I get the wrong name. Want to make sure that we have it right. Uh this is going to be a little bit of a different service. Uh I'm going to say a few words about the faith challenge report which just was printed this week. And I want to ask this congregation, I'll say a little more about it a little further on, but I would like to ask this congregation, if you please assist us. There's tremendous amount of work, not going in and printing this. Tremendous amount of work by the translators and the laborers and the ministers and the workers that are scattered everywhere. And this last Wednesday, if you were here at service, you heard brotherh brother Jason Neimar. And brother Jason, I I did not know. I was not acquainted with brother Jason. I had heard his name through brother Matthew Dertie some years ago. I I thought he was way in the eastern state somewhere and I discovered later that he was in Minnesota. We became acquainted actually when I responded to the Iranian young couple. They were just in their 30s and uh I responded to them to invite them to be able to immigrate to Canada because they were United Nations uh refugees from Iran and she needed a heart uh pacemaker in her heart. She had one but she needed it replaced right away. So we were trying to get them to come here and we worked very very hard and we were not successful. The Canadian government finally denied it uh because of the health issue. I think they didn't say. So anyway, but brother Jason, I knew that he had worked with the um in the Middle East and Turkey and Iran and especially with Iranian refugees that are coming into Turkey and some Syrians and so on. And so I never put oursel forward to uh engage in anything that we were here and I just wanted to know a little bit more about their work. And I just felt we just leave it at a very very uh quiet and remain uninvolved. And if God I' I've been you're looking at a person that feels very very strongly about God opening the door. If God doesn't open a door, friend, don't try to put forth it open. If God opens a door, then you just walk through it and yield yourself to it. And so, Brother Jason came here and brother Tim talked to him and spent a couple days with him. And brother Tom and Brother Murphy and brother John, we all were able to meet together and just fellowship and let him feel our spirit and and we could get better acquainted with him. Well, he went home and from Wednesday till now Sunday, he has sent uh perhaps you should tell us, brother Tim. 18 messages. There was &gt;&gt; a total of 18 messages. Uh 12 of them were Farsy which are Iranian and six of them are Armenian. Armenia is a country over there. So 18 of those messages and at this time we have over 30 in the Persian language which is the Farsy language which is Iranian Iranian language. And uh uh how many of them are up on the hub now? 30 &gt;&gt; 27 &gt;&gt; 27 are on the hub and we have enough for it'll soon be just about 40. Can you believe that? And this a very very restricted and oppressive uh uh country and enemy of Israel. But it's not a and we're there are people there that are under severe persecution. And we found out that one of the best and finest and most respected ministers, is in prison, and not only in prison, is in very poor health, is bleeding internally. And and I was so happy to find out that brother Jason knows him and knows his wife and speaks to her on a regular basis, just encouraging her. And uh they they certainly deserve our prayers. They certainly deserve, you know, our heartfelt prayers. No, God, remember them. And and as Apostle Paul said, remember my bonds. Remember those that are in bonds. And so we do want to do more than just remember by hearing it over the pulpit. Take it home in your heart. But uh and and and God, in fact, his brother Jason was going to set up his own website. And when he saw what was taking place here, he just abandoned it and said, "The hub is already set up and that's the way to go." So they're just loading them up there. And we were very clear to let them know that the hub doesn't belong to us. The hub belongs to the bride. &gt;&gt; And so I'd like to ask you to assist us by uh uh you've got some friends and pick up some of the faith challenge report. and and and send them out to them. Let them get them, excuse me, and uh ask them if they would like to hear more what's going on. In the central in the center page is a spread out. Excuse me. That is a a a central foldout page that starts with the work in India. God opened the door and that starts in 1981 when that first little handheld press, handfed press was uh bought and went every month right through to 212 2012. Only God can do that, friends. That's no no personal. We give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ. So, please pick them up and send them to some and let your friends know if you'd like to be put on the mailing list. That's the whole thing. I I just traveled. The reason why this is a burden to me, I've just gone I've just met a lot of people in the last 30 days and they don't get a message. They would like to, oh, they don't know what's going on. And I think that's a shame. I think we should let everybody, you young people, you all got friends. Send them to those friends. Send them up. Hey, here this is what's happening, you know, because a lot of young people, they don't perhaps even know or families or whoever. Send it to businessmen or whatever. Let them know what's what's taking place. There's a lot of churches just aren't, you know, don't don't have the same exposure. I don't know why God led us this way, but he has. &gt;&gt; And so, we say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to run with it. God bless you. Well, are we ready for the word? &gt;&gt; All right. This is going to be a little different service for me and I've really been wondering just how God will lead us, but he will lead us. Amen. Let's stand. And before we read the scripture, we'll pray. Heavenly Father, we've heard the children singing, the congregation singing, the special singing, the baby dedication. How we thank you for these things. Oh God, we are such a blessed people and we do not want to uh we do not want to be laxidasical about the blessings of God. We thank you. We have freedom to worship like this. How many there are in different places of the world would dearly love to be together. How many others, Lord, are streaming and would love to be here just now and worship together and be able to blend their voices. Oh God, I say we are so privileged to be able to open our mouths and say, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Praise and bless his holy name." God, we just owe you everything that we have. Thank you for health. Thank you for strength. Thank you for Jesus. Thank you for salvation, oh God. Thank you for the cleansing and the infilling of the Holy Spirit. Purge us, Lord. Forgive us our wrongs, our weaknesses, our sins, anything, oh God, whether we know of it or do not know of it. I pray that you will cleanse us, oh God. I pray, Father, that you will give us the ability of the Holy Spirit. Give us eyes to see, Lord, where we're at and what is happening and where we are in your economy. I pray that you will invigorate us, oh God. I pray you will take all of any effect or influence of Leodysia. Remove it out of us, oh God. We don't want to go that direction at all. We want to be fervent for the gospel of Jesus Christ. Pray you'll anoint Father uh my speaking and anoint father. I pray the people as they hear. I pray father that you will receive all the glory. We are here to glorify the name of Jesus Christ. And while others are racing around and wearing themselves out in this Christmas season, we are here at rest. We are in perfect peace. Oh God, thank you for this message and the messenger that you sent. and we want to give honor to you by giving honor to the word that you sent us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. As you take your Bibles, I'm going to read some familiar scripture that we read at this time of the year, but the message will be, I think, quite different for you. Uh we'll start in Luke the 2 chapter and verse 8. We'll read down to verse 16. Then I have a two verses I want to read out of John 20. That's where it may seem to be a little strange because one is his birth and the other is his death. And I want to speak on the gift came back. &gt;&gt; Came back quite a few times. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." Hallelujah. And this shall be a sign unto you, you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And the prophet said the swaddling clothes was the was the cloth that came off of the yolk of an oxen. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace and good will toward men." And it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us." I wish there were more shepherds even today. Let us go and see what's happened. Let's go and see what is what is uh the Lord has done. Let's let's find out about it. Amen. And be sincere. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says uh and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a manger. And now, so now they see a baby in a manger. In John the 20th chapter and verse 15, Mary has come to the suppler and uh sees and sees that there's angels have spoken to her and uh and Jesus said unto the unto her, she doesn't know it's Jesus. He's standing in the garden and and said,"Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?" And she supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if if you have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. And Jesus saith unto her, Mary. And I want to stop there. God bless his word to our hearts. You may be seated. You'll need to have uh your full focus this morning to follow through. I've labored very much diligently for this service and I trust it will be more than a blessing to you. I trust it will be something you'll be able to put into your heart and especially to those that have some years in front of them. I want you young men and young ladies to pay very strict attention and capture the thought. And if there's something you don't understand or a question arises, jot it down. Remember it if you would and you can come to me and I'll be delighted to speak to you further about that. This is a season when the world is just completely given over to uh the gift giving and the commercialization of this Christmas season. And it's it's a it's really sad. There's a lot of sadness that takes place at this time of the year. Uh, and we don't want to even speak about that at all. We know that the lamb of God, Jesus Christ, was not born in December to begin with. We we know that. We accept that. Brother Brandon preached his Christmas messages at this time of the year because it seems that's when people are in that uh kind of in that space or in that um emotionally uh adjusted to that and so they have uh uh he has spoken his Christmas message at this time and so I've read this scripture but I'm going to take it a little different angle. Uh to me it life is far more precious. You have we have life and the promise of eternal life. This is the most precious thing uh that we can think of. I think just now for a moment the uh there's parents of the 26 children in uh Connecticut. I believe it is New Town. And if you ask them at this Christmas season, what is the most desirous thing that you have that you can even imagine? What would you uh what would you like to have? And I'm sure they would say life. &gt;&gt; Life. &gt;&gt; Just give me my child back. Have all the trinkets. Have all the turkey. Have everything else. Have all the celebration. Just give me my child back. &gt;&gt; Life is the precious item. &gt;&gt; And you that are sitting here breathing, we have life &gt;&gt; and we have it for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And we're not here to be idle. We're here God has given you. And that life belongs to God. &gt;&gt; He's the one who gave it to you. And the breath of every man is in God's hand. And when your breath stops, you're gone. &gt;&gt; And like the song says, then what? You want to think about that &gt;&gt; and live your life as though you're ready to die at any time. &gt;&gt; I can tell you that town and America as a whole never expected to deal with such an incredible massacre. And it seems to me when I first heard it, I said, "It's tribulation. Right. &gt;&gt; It's it's we're living right in the shadows of it. &gt;&gt; We're not having to wait for tribulation. It's like it's it's like the tribulation is like it's imposing itself upon us &gt;&gt; almost prematurely. &gt;&gt; We're still here and we know we're here for a rapture. &gt;&gt; I hope you know that. And if you don't know that, all you have to do is read the newspaper and you want to say, "God, make me ready. &gt;&gt; Help me realize where we're at. at this time there was an account of a and I I want uh on the screen uh just that first slide in a moment I'll just give you a moment there was an account of a world war flying fortress crew and I thought it's so wonderful to have our brother Edwin Dodd here this morning God bless brother Edwin pilot of a B-58 8 that carried hydrogen nuclear bombs. And this man was a pilot of the plane. And he was uh received citation by the United States president for keeping his crew safe when there was a fire on the plane. And he was able to get it out. And he did something that was very and the reason he received a citation is because the instruments were showing that the fire had been dealt with. But he flew into the clouds because it swept back wings like this. And he flew into the clouds to see if there was any reflection of the fire. And apparently there still was some. And they took some other measures and the fire was put out and he saved that B-58 bomber worth hundreds of millions of dollars and hydrogen bombs. Who knows what would have happened? And this man sitting right here, a believer of this message sitting here today. God bless you, brother Edwin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. this plane. You can put it up on the screen if you would please. This is an old flying fortress. I won't say old. This is a second second world war flying fortress and they were I think B28s or B uh B17s and maybe I don't know what the other they were more than one class of them. And the reason I'm showing this is because the crew on one of these planes were flying in a very very dangerous bombing uh mission during the Second World War and they were under very heavy fire attack with anti-aircraft fire. and the flack. You know, some of you young people may not know what flack is, but they fire the anti-aircraft shells and then they burst and explode and uh you see black uh explosion all over the place and they were under very very heavy fire. And there was a chaplain on the plane and the chaplain came over the sound system of the aircraft and everyone of course is hearing and he said to the men, "Have no fear, men, for the presence of God surrounds you." And uh in the midst of all of that confusion and war and sound and fighting and gunfire and and them trying to protect the plane, I can't show it to you exactly, but uh way back here at the end. Not not that rear wheel down here. way back here. You see there's a couple guns way way way at the back right there at the bubble right there. Here's a bubble at front. They have some guns and there's a bubble way back there. The couple guns and he's sitting all by himself. That's a massive massive aircraft. And he's sitting all there by himself. And he hears the chaplain's voice, "Have no fear, man. The presence of God surrounds you." and he spoke on his and he says he says that's okay for you guys up in the front and in the cockpit but he's not way down here where I'm sitting all alone and he just just as he said that one of these anti-aircraft missile shells shot right through the fuselage of the plane and didn't explode and left two big holes where it went in and went out. And he came back on the he came back on the speaker and he said, "Correction, &gt;&gt; God just walked in." So, you can take that off. I'm going to be using that theme. The prophet spoke on the world falling apart again. &gt;&gt; And back then it was falling apart. And the shepherds were just doing what they always do, hurting their sheep. And they had to have announcement. &gt;&gt; This world isn't falling apart. There's a correction. &gt;&gt; God just walked in. &gt;&gt; I thought of the first time. My mind immediately goes through the Bible. I was on the subject when I heard this account of this bomber and I thought how fitting that is. I had to get up and go to my study and start making some notes because it was coming so quickly upon my mind. And I thought of all of the uh precious things that God could have given what God did for this gunner and his and the men that were on that plane. He gave them the gift of life. &gt;&gt; And for whatever reason, that shell did not explode and preserved and gave those men life. And I say that was the best thing that God could have given them. And for whatever reason, we do not know. Maybe somebody was praying for them. We don't know. The Bible tells us about Adam. I'm just going to go quickly through the scripture with you. That he possessed he actually possessed this priceless gift of eternal life. He actually had it. And and it isn't as though he lost it in a permanent way, but he forfeited the right to eternal life. And brother Brandham speaks about him. He says, "But what God did, he breathed the breath of eternal life," speaking of Adam. "And then he became a living soul, a soul that can't die." Breathed the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal soul. Then in uh in the Hebrew series, he said God made a promise to Abraham. He says, "Adam, if you will not touch that tree, you'll live forever." &gt;&gt; And then quickly we see God's children fell. What a tragedy. What a crisis. And in the in the messages all the way through, he the prophetist spoke on uh on conference with God. And he says when there's a crisis, &gt;&gt; these boys in this plane were in a crisis. And when the world's in a crisis or a family's in a crisis or an individual's in a crisis, and I'm speaking to you directly today, everybody experiences a crisis. &gt;&gt; Don't forget in the middle of the crisis, just when you think God isn't there, You'll you'll want to be able to say and you'll need to be able to say correction. God just walked in. &gt;&gt; And Adam had lost his inheritance and lost his life. And the prophet says in the breach that he turned loose the word and sold out. He lost also his inheritance. He didn't just lose his life. He lost his inheritance in his life. We all know what an inheritance is. &gt;&gt; And some of you may be written your names may even be in in a human will and you don't know it. And someone will die and make the will effective. And the Bible says that the will is not effective. The testament is not effective without the death of the testator. So the testator has to die. You don't even know you're in the will. And then you'll get called and you must come to an attorney's office, a lawyer's office. And the lawyer will sit there as a as the executive of the estate and will say, "Uh, I have the will of your loved one, your father, your mother, your uncle, or whoever. And in the will, you've been included. And I' you've been called here. You have been called here." And I say you have been called here &gt;&gt; because you've been left in a will &gt;&gt; and one of my duties is to express to you what is in that will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you walk in you are you are in the same state you were the week before, the day before or the year before. But as the will is being read then you find out maybe to John I have left my car or to uh to Mary the wife or whatever we've left the house I have left the house and and these are the details and and when you walk out you have a piece of paper you have a piece of paper and now you have the house based on that piece of paper you have the car based on that piece of paper. I have a piece of paper here that says that healing is yours. &gt;&gt; I have a piece of paper here that says if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, thou shalt be saved. &gt;&gt; That's what God's will. And God is not a man that can lie. &gt;&gt; God can only speak the truth. The question is, do you receive the will? &gt;&gt; That is that's more than poetic license. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; And Adam had lost his life and lost his inheritance in his life. For he said, "In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." And when he lost his life, he also lost his inheritance in life. So a crisis happened. And in the midst of this crisis, perhaps they didn't even realize perhaps how deep the crisis is. Sometimes in this world, this is a thing that I I've noticed. Listen very closely now. I have found and I've stood off and looked at people's lives and determined that they are in a much worse situation than they realize. &gt;&gt; They're in a very dangerous situation. The go the Satan has his anti-aircraft attack or his aircraft attack on this life on this home and whatever more. I say, God, open our eyes &gt;&gt; so we can see things as they really are &gt;&gt; and let's not live dangerously. &gt;&gt; Let's live safely. &gt;&gt; Let's live sheltered in the hands of almighty God. You agree with me? &gt;&gt; I'm preaching with all my heart tonight this morning, friends, because I we we're in a real crisis time. This world is a sick world &gt;&gt; and there's thousands of directions that people are going and saying this is the truth and this is the truth and this it can't all be the truth. &gt;&gt; Somebody's lying &gt;&gt; and somebody's telling the truth. &gt;&gt; And I uh you say well how can we know? I'm here as your friend. I'm here as a minister of Jesus Christ. And I'm saying to you, if we haven't got any other way to know, I would seek out where God has vindicated and proven supernaturally that this is not a man. &gt;&gt; It no man can do this. &gt;&gt; Search the world and find if anybody can do this. And if nobody can do it and and and they're declaring Jesus Christ and and preaching the truth of God's word, if they're doing that, then I would attach myself to that man or that person &gt;&gt; or that truth. &gt;&gt; Let God vindicate it. And then say, "I didn't vindicate it. You did it. &gt;&gt; You did it supernaturally. and I'm simply following what you what you proved &gt;&gt; and what you stood behind. &gt;&gt; Don't you think that would be good advice? So a crisis happened and and the prophet said in conferences the first conference was a Eden conference and God that the first conference that God ever held was the first emergency arose and we'll call it the Eden Conference. And this was the first emergency when word came up to heaven that God's son and his daughter his children that he had put in Eden had lost their place of grace lost their place in grace and had gone away from God and was backsliden and naked. He said, "No doubt." But what many of the angels wanted to go down, wanted to go down and see if they could do something about it, but God wanted to hold the conference himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was his child that was in trouble and he couldn't trust it to any angels. And he said a wonderful statement. I don't recall remembering it before. I want to leave it with you. And he says, "And heaven couldn't hold him any longer. Aren't you glad heaven couldn't hold them any longer? And while Adam and Eve are walking around now, having fallen from grace, &gt;&gt; but God walked in. &gt;&gt; And Adam could have said, "But God just walked in." &gt;&gt; And they heard the voice of God walking in the garden saying, "Adam, Adam, where art thou? Oh, what a heavenly father we have. Friends, we don't want to get caught up in this little rat race down here. All this tinsel and junk and stuff. People receiving things they don't need and stuff they don't want and all the rest of people are so caught up in it. Let us here this morning say thank you father. In this generation, I don't want to get ahead of myself, but in this generation, I I while I was busy with my religion and my organization and my beliefs and all of my traditions and all my stuff, you walked in. &gt;&gt; While I was in the middle of all of this uh warfare and struggle in my life, &gt;&gt; God walked in. you know it was him. &gt;&gt; Heaven couldn't hold him any longer and they heard his voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day. There were other times when God stepped down and walked in after the flood. I'm going real quickly now. After the flood, the people got together and they said, "We've just come through a horrific destruction. All humanity wiped off. All flesh wiped off &gt;&gt; off the map." And they said, "Let us build a city and let us build a tower." What is that? That's protection. That's that's maybe like uh the nations of the world right now, they're racing for intercontinental missiles. That's nothing more than the tower. &gt;&gt; Let's let's have a security system up here. We lived in the far north and after the Second World War, they said, "We don't know what's going to happen. We know that we've entered into an atomic warfare. We we've entered into another season and now there's a potential to actually destroy the earth &gt;&gt; and we've got to have a a security system. So they started the North NORAD across northern Canada. And then every so many hundreds of miles they'd have another string of them. And one of them right here, you may not know it, but you were at the camp down at Horizon in Birch Bay. And that was one of the connections from the Arctic and because they were fearful of the Russians sending missiles over and come across and they would detect them up in the Canadian Arctic and send the signal down. And one of them that's why 60 acres is given over the horizon camp. That's what that was. And there's huge concrete structure right there. Now it's because the thing has become so advanced. I hadn't intended on even getting into this, but it'll bring it real to you. That's what that spot was all about. And then they had a string of them across the United States to alert the military that missiles are coming. That's a let's build a tower. &gt;&gt; Let's build a wall. Let's build a city. Let's look after our economy. Let's protect ourselves. And God looked on it. And the Bible says, "And God came down. What are you silly people doing? &gt;&gt; This will never protect you. &gt;&gt; Missiles will never protect us. &gt;&gt; The men in Washington, the men in Ottawa, and the and the intellectuals of of of Europe, they haven't got the answer. Right. &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying to you very plainly, I I feel I preach differently right now because I never know when my last one is &gt;&gt; and I want it to be good. &gt;&gt; They haven't got the answer. &gt;&gt; It's a complete dilemma. &gt;&gt; And so God, he said, I will certainly return. No, he said uh and the Lord and the Lord came down to see the city and to see the tower which the children of men builded. And he's still doing it. Listen friends, a prophet came in this generation and I think a lot of people think it lightly. A lot of people even because they don't understand it, they just put it out of their mind. And they were talking about all the uh un not unseen but uh unidentified flying objects and they say and then people you know they uh say well one landed here and one landed all gets into kind of a a space that we can't really fully describe. And I won't say every one of them, but a prophet of God said, and don't forget when I say prophet of God, I'm talking about vindicated prophet, proven prophet, somebody that spoke of the scriptures. And when he spoke of the scriptures, this book became open, that kind of prophet, and revealed the secret of the heart of men and women by the thousands. That kind of prophet. And he said, "They're investigating angels." That's no mystery. That's exactly what Genesis said in. And they came down. &gt;&gt; God came down &gt;&gt; to see the city. So, what are you people doing? And to see the tower. Oh, we're protecting ourselves. Don't fool yourself. We're not protecting those missiles and bombs and the and the peacemaker missile and all of these great intercontinental and the hydrogen bombs and all of this military stuff. I won't protect you. You got to have something that's under the um something made out of feathers, &gt;&gt; under the wings of the almighty God. &gt;&gt; And so God came down. Abraham after waiting about 25 years older and older and older and more infertile all the time and he's sitting in his tent drawer in the heat of the day. Nothing's happened &gt;&gt; for 25 years. Or you might think, "Oh, he had wonderful communion with God. You take and read and you can read in the scripture. Please do it &gt;&gt; as I have done it. And I have read and I took my watch out and I time and I read I try to read at the time the same speed God would speak. &gt;&gt; And I I read every communication that God spoke to Abraham in 25 years and it's about 12 minutes. You're quiet. We expect God to be our our little Aaron boy. Do this, do that, do that, help me here, help me there, help me in my exam, help me in my test, help me with this, and help me with my job and help me with all the rest of it. Help me raising my kids and all the rest of it. He just pours his blessings out and say, "Hey, don't don't ask me so much. Just believe what I already said." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm looking for somebody to believe me. &gt;&gt; And Abraham just said, he believes God. The Bible says he believes God. And he's sitting in this tent door. God's talked to him for 12 minutes in the last 25 years. And he's sitting there still childless. And he's coming close to a hundred. And with all of that, maybe it could on his mind. He could have said what the gutter said. Just a moment. I see three men. God just walked in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God just walked in. &gt;&gt; Right in the midst of this. Right in the midst of when I I failed. Did you ever fail? &gt;&gt; Abram failed. &gt;&gt; We're all there. &gt;&gt; I failed. You failed. Abraham failed. David failed. The prophets failed. The pro our prophet said there was flaws in every one of the prophets. They all failed. &gt;&gt; But that did not stop the program of God because God kept walking in &gt;&gt; and God walked in &gt;&gt; and God spoke to him and he bargained with God over Sodom. It was the same situation. The world was falling apart back then, his world at least. And he spoke to God, &gt;&gt; "Surely you won't destroy the righteous with the wicked." &gt;&gt; And he was started with 50 and went down to 10. They couldn't find 10. Couldn't find 10. &gt;&gt; It's a sobering thought when we're sitting here probably a few hundred people. We're sitting here and and he couldn't find 10. I pray if that same God came and walked amongst us here now as he has with his word, he'll find righteous ones who have anchored their soul &gt;&gt; in the haven of rest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're at peace. &gt;&gt; You're my father. &gt;&gt; They said to Jesus, "How should we pray?" First words, "Our Father." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a blessed thing, brother Ernie. We might have we might have our relatives leave us down here, but he will never leave us. And he will never forsake us. &gt;&gt; And he knows every detail of our lives. &gt;&gt; And God came down. And he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo, three men stood by him. And when he saw them, he ran to meet them. From the tent door, bowed himself toward the ground. I trust we would all have that. Run to meet him. Don't have someone have to drag you to church. Run to meet him. &gt;&gt; When he begins to reveal himself to you, lay down your life. Bow yourself down. I'm yours. &gt;&gt; I'll give my all. I'll yield to you. What? What are you doing in this generation? Here I am. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Some of you may have to go against your natural nature. Your nature might be, you know, calm and laidback and don't take anything too serious. You better take this generation serious. &gt;&gt; You better take this message serious. &gt;&gt; And when you see this and feel the straining of the Holy Spirit and straining at your life &gt;&gt; and telling you this is not the way, you better listen to that voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Help me out, folks. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord and he said,"Lord, I now if I found favor in your sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from my servant." And down just a little further. And he said, and the Lord speaking to him, this one who just stepped in, don't tell me he didn't have doubts and fears, but God just stepped in. &gt;&gt; And he said, I will certainly return unto you according to the time of life. And Sarah thy wife shall have a son. &gt;&gt; The thing you've desired, &gt;&gt; you've desired from God. If it's a godly desire, you shall have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things you desire when you pray. &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; Believe. You that didn't say it. Say it again. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; When you pray, believe &gt;&gt; that you shall receive it and you shall have it. &gt;&gt; God just walked in, folks. God just walked in. That's God's words, not my words. That's God's words. &gt;&gt; You may think about Abraham because you identify with Abraham. Let me as God's servant now identify with God. God's coming in and he's saying walking up, put some material together and walked into a body. You're walking out because he has something to do. &gt;&gt; He's walking in a body because he's got to speak a certain language that this man, his servant, understands &gt;&gt; and he's coming up to Abraham. He's sure Abraham will recognize him and identify him from these other two that are angels. and and and Abraham bows down, tells his wife and tells the young man, "Go and get some meat and get a young calf and a good one and and bring it and and and tells his wife to prepare some loaves." And he's standing there and they're feeding and he's standing there watching them and in the mind of God, God knew and he said it in the word. He's tried this man for 25 years. I've tried him for 25 years. I have to make sure that he's a solid one because he's going to be part of the foundation that I'm going to build my masterpiece on. &gt;&gt; It's the first corner. &gt;&gt; You've never heard me speak on this. I've never ever thought of it before. But this is God. I'm speaking on his behalf. This is a corner. This is the first corner of my foundation of my masterpiece. &gt;&gt; And he saw in his masterpiece, the prophet said that masterpiece was so much like him and his perfect image that the author himself stepped into the masterpiece and he became the God man. &gt;&gt; And now I'm going to give him a message. He's crying for a son for inheritance. But I want the next corner to my masterpiece. And I will return to you according to the time of life. And your wife shall have a son. Sarah shall have a son. But in God's mind, that's the next corner to my foundation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God came down. Amen. &gt;&gt; When it looks hopeless and to you and some may be on the internet today, you may be in a situation looks hopeless. &gt;&gt; I can tell you this, God will come in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you'll say, "And God stepped in &gt;&gt; at the critical moment." He stepped in &gt;&gt; and God was set the second corner to the masterpiece foundation. Then when he came to Moses, he said, "I'm the God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; Isaac, and Jacob." &gt;&gt; That's three corners. &gt;&gt; And the fourth one was Joseph. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we spoke of Joseph today dedicating the baby Daniel and Judah. Daniel, Judah, because Judah was one of the patriarchs. And he's pleading with uh interceding with Joseph. And Joseph perfect type the prophet said perfect type of Jesus Christ and he kept himself what did he do? He kept himself concealed which what oh I hope you have understanding that's why we talk about the seals all the time is because he Joseph kept himself concealed &gt;&gt; until this end time &gt;&gt; when God stepped in. And we'll talk more about it as we go along. And the foundation is laid through faith, love, grace, and to perfection through the patriarchs. &gt;&gt; But he says, "Now the body work, the body of Jesus Christ came to his this great masterpiece." The body work. I want to say this slowly now. The body work. the body. God's dealing with the foundation, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. And now he's going to build the masterpiece. The body was built by the prophets. &gt;&gt; Because the word came to the prophets and the masterpiece was to be the word. And that's why I read for you just a Sunday or two ago this uh now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. &gt;&gt; Do you remember it? &gt;&gt; A lot of you don't remember the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. In other words, listen class. This is how it happened. Whereas Joseph took his wife wife Mary and he had not known her and told him what is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And when he he gave detail of all the details listen now all the details. Now I'm tying it together with another one expecting you to be mature believers. I'm tying it together with another one where the prophet now has said the body was built by the prophets. &gt;&gt; God put the foundation down. But the prophets built the body of Jesus Christ and from the very birth and he said these words. I like them so much uh just so you'll follow it. And now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. What do you get out of that? I wouldn't be wrong in saying this is how it happened. &gt;&gt; Would that be right? &gt;&gt; This is how it happened. When his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph, so she was engaged to Joseph. Before they came together, she was found with a child. She's found pregnant. And ju Joseph being a a man of integrity, not willing to make a public example. And he was mind he was minded in his mind I should put her away. But while he thought on these things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, &gt;&gt; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Now the word comes to the prophet, &gt;&gt; and the spirit comes to the word. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; I want a yay or a nay. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word comes to the prophet and the spirit comes to the word. &gt;&gt; God has given the man human seed. Semen &gt;&gt; seed. &gt;&gt; And you as women may conceive as a mother or a wife conceive seed. But if that spirit, that breath of God does not enter that body, you'll have a still birth. &gt;&gt; And everyone who's sitting here did not have a still birth. That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; And God permitted you to come on earth because he's got a purpose in your life. &gt;&gt; And one of the main purposes is he's going to present you with the gospel and see what you're going to do with it. &gt;&gt; Is that clear? Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is how Jesus was born. And it says, "And she shall bring forth a son." It's not finished. She will bring forth a son, and you will call his name Jesus, &gt;&gt; for he shall save his people from their sins. &gt;&gt; That's what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; And now all of this was done. All of what was done. Just what we just said. &gt;&gt; This is how it happened. How it happened. This was all done. all done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophets. So the prophets spoke the word of the Lord. Now instead of God coming down in a body, he used the bodies of the prophets &gt;&gt; and bypassed their own intelligence and spoke his word out of their mouth. And that word created whatever it spoke about. And when a prophet said, "A virgin shall conceive," a virgin did conceive. &gt;&gt; Many other women conceive, but this one was different. &gt;&gt; This one was a young virgin girl, perhaps 15 years old. And the prophet of God comes in the end time to take the mystery away from it and says that the words of those prophets spoken hundreds of years ago anchored in her womb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, don't just sit here looking at me today. I'm preaching Matthew the words of this prophet and even those prophets. I got some statements here by Tommy Osborne I'm going to have you read in a little while. And and and he says he says this was he he spoke about Elijah. He was speaking about brother Brandon's ministry. He said Elijah didn't do that. &gt;&gt; Moses didn't do that. He said this is another generation. Amen. &gt;&gt; I ask you, &gt;&gt; what has this prophet's word done for you? &gt;&gt; What has this vindication done for you? What has almighty God who who came &gt;&gt; and used this body of flesh? What has it done for you? You may say, "Oh, that's 40 years." What's 40 years? &gt;&gt; In a few years, you'll even say, "Where'd the last five go to?" &gt;&gt; Or, "You just turned a birthday. I couldn't believe your parents said you had been here seven years. I thought it was I thought it was three or four. I couldn't believe Brother Hillbrand said you've been here seven years. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said the boys were only seven and eight years old. We just had Orin's 18th birthday. That incredible. Orin, why don't you stand up? You're just a You were just a shrimp when I saw you. Look at this guy. Joseph, why don't you stand up? Look at these two guys. Look at the size of them. And with the passing of time, they went from 3 feet to 6 feet. God bless you. Sit down. And this is how it happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's here's brother Jay and sister. What a meeting. Sister Gracie standing here. My goodness. They have grown children older than you fellas and they're starting all over again. Maybe somebody will get some ideas. What an example. God bless you, brother Jay. And they're happy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then he talked about the masterpiece. The So the prophets built the body. &gt;&gt; Stay with me because I got a ways to go and it'll be more interesting as we go along. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And now the prophet in this day says, but here at last coming up through that finally comes the masterpiece, the perfect one. No fault in him at all. &gt;&gt; So perfect reflected the builder himself. The builder was so perfectly reflected. His own image was reflected in his own work. God and Christ were one &gt;&gt; in so much until he put his own spirit into him. It wasn't just that he appeared that way, but God his his spirit he put into him and the builder and the image and the builder became one. In the message he swore by himself. He said, "And the blood of sheep and goats held him thus far as potentially until the fullness time come." He said, "Then God came down himself." &gt;&gt; There was Simeon. There was Anna. &gt;&gt; There was Caiaphas, the high priest. There was a priest, the Levites, and all these people. And by now they all had their ideas. &gt;&gt; This is how you kill the lamb and this is what you must do and we must be very very specific because you know this is what our prophets have said. said this and that and they kind of went off to the side and added to it a little bit and you know they they they uh glossed it over and as long as you come to the synagogue and you wrapped your arm up and have the facities or whatever they call them and you know the gowns and you have your long dresses and make sure your hair is just right and the young men are clean and you come to church and you put in the treasury your offerings and tithes and all of these things takes more than that. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I need the Holy Ghost." I'll tell you a good way to get the Holy Ghost to get the word first. &gt;&gt; And you get the word in you and the Holy Ghost will come to that world every time. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? I have so many people say, "I need the Holy Ghost." What you need is the word. You get the message into you and the Holy Ghost will come to that word every time. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, there's nothing to come to. &gt;&gt; It's all through the scripture. The prophet says it very clearly. And it's surprising how many people, even senior people, don't feed on the word. &gt;&gt; And if you don't feed on the word, you won't have a very great measure of the spirit. So the blood of sheeps and goats held him this far, held God this far as potentially until the fullness came. Then God came down himself and an angel, not a cherubam, but God came down from heaven and went all the way to hell to bring man up from hell to heaven with him. Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; God came all the way down, not just to earth, but he entered into a body, took the body to death, and then continued to descend even to the regions of the lost and to hell itself. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So he could say, I've conquered death, &gt;&gt; hell, and the grave. Amen. &gt;&gt; And because I live, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; And in the midst of all this religiosity and all this tradition and doing everything right, and God stepped in. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God gave me a voice of a thousand tongues to declare this glorious thing. And God stepped in. I I can tell you that this generation, this modern society didn't baffle God. &gt;&gt; In the midst of this, after the second birth pain, God stepped in &gt;&gt; to bring man up from hell. &gt;&gt; In Shreport, it said Christ was God's love gift &gt;&gt; to the world. greatest gift that God ever gave &gt;&gt; was his only begotten son. &gt;&gt; That was God's greatest gift. &gt;&gt; And he said God's gift, &gt;&gt; hello. &gt;&gt; Always &gt;&gt; find their places. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; God's gift has found its place in you. What do you think? How does that How do you think that makes God feel &gt;&gt; when God's gift, the greatest gift &gt;&gt; found its place &gt;&gt; and found it in you &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit hovered over you and came to you. I'm not lost. I'm just thinking. I see brother Elias Childers. His wife and children are sitting there. Is that the boy that was in the meeting the other night? I was down. You're the boy sitting in the meeting. I came home and told my wife about you and brother Tom Frey if you had the meeting for anybody and for that boy and it was not until I started getting into brother Tom Frey felt it on his heart come and tell the children how you grew up tell the children the difficulties you had tell the young people how you dealt with things cuz we think you know you probably dealt with some of the things. I didn't know where to start and brother Tom gave a little introduction. I I just said to the kids about 30 40 of them up to some of the young men young ladies that are here. I said, 'Well, I didn't know really where to start. I just said, 'Well, my world kind of fell apart when I was six and a half and my mother died. I said, "My folks have been Catholic and we came, you know, they they were Catholic, but then they came to know Christ and their winds of Pentecost were were just beginning to sweep over the country, and they gave their life to Christ. But I says, "My world fell apart because I didn't have mom." And then we had some housekeepers. And and so I shuffle from one housekeeper to the other. Sometime we didn't have anybody. And my sister and I would have to come home from school. I'm only in grade two or grade three. and uh said we had to go back and put on dinner for my dad who was working trying to support us in hard times and then run back and have a bite of lunch with my dad and and that's when we didn't have any housekeeper. I'm not going to labor with this. I'm just simply going to say and I saw at that point when I started telling about the hardships and we had plenty of them and I'll just say this and finish from the time I was seven and just a few weeks ago I did the count and I don't know why uh nobody was asking me but I thought I should find out how many places I just lived in a lot of places and I was boarded out at this farm and that was three miles walk to school and I boarded out another place and the woman was totally blind. And I said to the kids, I've never said to you, I I I just keep these things because I don't think they're important. But I said, the the woman was totally blind and they were above middle age and never had any children. And I said, now you go to the breakfast table tomorrow morning and and I said and and cut a pancake open. They were so poor. The only thing they had was molasses. And because she was blind, she didn't want to burn the food. So she would it wasn't cooked completely. And I said, "And just have the molasses run with the dough and uncooked pancake." And I says, "That was breakfast tomorrow morning." And I said there was there was just nothing that nothing left to do. I mean, you know, I didn't sit and complain to them. That was the only thing we had to eat. and you got to hike off to school and maybe take the horses for half an half a mile to water them and cut some kindling wood. And up in the north country and Grand Prairie where brother Tim is from and his family who some of them here there's some secrets about the north they don't tell you. And that is it doesn't get light till about 9:30 10:00 in the morning and it starts getting dark about 3:30 in the afternoon. 4:00 whenever all I can tell you is we had to go to school in the dark and come home in the dark. And after that, you know, had to do the chores for the next day. I don't want anybody's sympathy. It's not worth it. I just thought I thought this the whole this the way the whole world lived. I didn't know any different. I thought everybody was eating up with mosquitoes. I thought everybody drove on little gravel roads and I thought that everybody got up in the dark and went home in the dark. That that was just standard. So I didn't have anything to relate it to. So did I think I was being treated bad? No, not really. But you know in the midst of all this and then you have a you have something in your heart &gt;&gt; and I want to say I know you have it in your heart and especially the young people you got the whole world in front of you. You start feeling it's just not exactly right. Do you know what God is saying? He's saying you're right. It's not right. &gt;&gt; Just just turn away from it. Just turn away from it. And that's exactly what I found. Am I off my subject? Not a bit. And then I were in church. All we knew, my wife and I, all we knew was church. Went to church. We did everything. If I had to sweep the floor, we swept the floor. Played the guitar, sang, did whatever we could do. If somebody wanted to hear a testimony, maybe give a testimony. When I got up about 18, asked me to speak. And so I preached. And then I just saw I saw the best that there was the most godly people, the most Holy Ghost people. I just started going I actually thank God I was buried up in the far north and didn't have to have contact with people. And a brother said to me, "Have you heard what Brother Brandham is preaching these days?" I said, "No, my words were this." I said, "Well, I' I've just remained kind of buried up here in the North Country and just let the rest of the world go by." That's where I was. That's where I was. I was in my tent door, not in the heat of the day, but probably in the cold. And God walked in. I tell you what, there was a lot of temptation around the country, folks. I'm just a young man like you young men. Lots of temptation around the country. Same devil, &gt;&gt; same temptations, &gt;&gt; same discouragement, same unbelief, same everything. And when I thought the whole world was collapsing, then God walked in. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm unashamed &gt;&gt; to preach this gospel because it's real and it works. &gt;&gt; And I can't only tell you that the candle that got lit. But I can tell you it's still burning. &gt;&gt; It's still real. &gt;&gt; And I declare it to you young ladies and young men, new families. God's got the answer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there isn't a thing, there isn't a situation that anybody's in, but what God knows about it. &gt;&gt; And he will see the believer through it. &gt;&gt; You mean more to him as his child. &gt;&gt; You're his beloved ones &gt;&gt; and he's going to see you through it. &gt;&gt; And I know that you all can relate to it. I felt it in my heart that this will relate to every person that hears me today because we're all got a such a variety of situations in our lives. &gt;&gt; But you have experienced a moment when you thought you were at the end &gt;&gt; and you're like that gunner at the tail and you're trying to ward off all the enemy and all the thing you know and then God steps in. &gt;&gt; Just make sure that you recognize it. Give me a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; Mary stood outside the grave. Her world had fell apart. Her blessed savior and the one that her Messiah and the one that they gave their lives to and they followed this work, this religious group. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends? I know that you are because you're thinking it over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You need to commit yourself unreservedly &gt;&gt; to this Lord Jesus Christ who revealed himself in this time. &gt;&gt; I know that God has stepped into your life. You can look back and you can say, "I was all engaged. I was all I was just at my work. I was just at my school. I was just at something. And then God stepped in. blow a hole through my my little vessel. &gt;&gt; There was a great flurry of events. Let me just go quickly, please. I don't want to drag you and keep you here longer than I need to. But there was a flurry of events from the time of the last supper until uh I would say that the emotions took their peaks and and plunged to their lowest point to the believers because from the last supper then finally you know the judgment hall and condemnation and the indictment and it sent him to Calvary and there he is and he's hanging the most a mimicious death, the most cruel death. Hang your leader, your spiritual leader, the pastor, the prophet. &gt;&gt; And he's hanging there gasping for breath between two common criminals. What could be lower than that? &gt;&gt; I'll go to the tomb. I tell you what, she wasn't skipping and dancing to the tomb. &gt;&gt; I'll go to the supplr. I'll see if he's still there. and sees two white angels. Even that doesn't startle her too much. Said, "Who who do you seek?" Jesus. &gt;&gt; Tell me where he is. So I can go to him. He's not here. He's risen. Doesn't compute. She goes outside. She's standing there in the midst of that sorrow and grief &gt;&gt; and we all experienced times like this &gt;&gt; and she she didn't even know it but God had stepped in &gt;&gt; in a different wrapping. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I'd like to preach to you this morning. &gt;&gt; He was wrapped in a different wrapping. &gt;&gt; He stepped in and knew her name, &gt;&gt; not a whole bunch of other names. He wasn't interested in a whole big church congregation success. He's in a different rapping. &gt;&gt; Now he looks like the gardener working for a landscape group. &gt;&gt; Sir, tell me where you put him. And still it was in her heart, I will go to him. &gt;&gt; And he says, Mary, &gt;&gt; Mary said to me, Edward said to you, Michael, said to you, Gary, call you Lisa. He knew your name. He knows your name this morning. And if you feel a twinge or something happening beyond the emotion that I'm going through, &gt;&gt; but something deep &gt;&gt; because he's calling your name. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, don't miss that. &gt;&gt; In that darkest moment, God just stepped in. &gt;&gt; Aren't we happy, brother Ernie? &gt;&gt; I've heard your testimony many times. He's just saying it this morning. Then the world began to fall apart again. Women went to work and they were earning big money on the war project. And the boys come back and the enemy is defeated and it's crushed. People are suffering horrifically. 6 million Jews are gone. Around 76 million men and women and children died. And what do you think God now? He wouldn't even know without a prophet. Excuse me for weeping, but you wouldn't know without a prophet that the earth was convulsing with the birth pain. &gt;&gt; It has to bring something forth. &gt;&gt; And just then what broke on the scene &gt;&gt; was a God man. &gt;&gt; A Jesus man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God just stepped in &gt;&gt; a world that was encased in darkness and such misery and such sorrow and displacement of people. And you'll see the cities are nothing but ashes in Japan lost 100,000 people. Just one bomb melted the skin on their bodies. And the Bible speaks of it that the flesh and their eyes. Well, now I'm not trying to be dramatic. I'm talking about the world you and I live in. &gt;&gt; And it's not getting better. &gt;&gt; And this Bible says it will wax worse and &gt;&gt; worse &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; worse. &gt;&gt; And that's the world we're in. And the Holy Spirit is pleading with people from this church &gt;&gt; and from others who have been touched by the message. &gt;&gt; Don't take it casual &gt;&gt; because also what this prophet says, the rapture will come and in such a way that people will be saying, well, isn't there the rapture that's supposed to happen? And he says, it will already have happened. &gt;&gt; I just heard that again the other day and I said, &gt;&gt; oh God, Don't let me preach. &gt;&gt; Don't let me hear these services. Don't let me believe what I believe &gt;&gt; and miss that. &gt;&gt; And I realize you've got to have the faith &gt;&gt; and believe with all your heart that if there's one going, &gt;&gt; you've got to be able to declare from the depths of your soul, not because the prophet said it, but from within yourself. If there's only one going, I am going. Sometimes we have to say that in sheer faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the world falling apart. That messenger will come and say the world is again. It's like it was, he said, 2,000 years ago. Now we've come back. And Jesus, Jesus, this lovely one, this masterpiece before going, he said, as it was to whoever would hear him, and there's many more people heard him than perhaps sitting here this morning. I don't know what they did with it, but he was saying to the congregation, and I'm saying it, I'm repeating his words, friends. These aren't brother Biscos's words. These are Jesus words. said, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the day when the son of man," they knew who he was. They were talking about when the son of man is revealed. &gt;&gt; And as it was in the days of Sodom, even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. &gt;&gt; Friends, we have it everywhere. &gt;&gt; We have it everywhere. this world. I'm not negative. I'm a very positive person. But this world is in a horrible state &gt;&gt; until we even as believers don't know what to do. Kind of throw up our hands and say, "Well, you know that what are we supposed to do? This is who waits on you on your restaurant table. This is who serves you in the airlines." &gt;&gt; You see it all over in the schools and the colleges and everywhere. And they're just it's just festering with perversion, &gt;&gt; is it not? &gt;&gt; Let the people of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; And God stepped in. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm far from over, but I'm going to I'm going to take about the next 10 minutes and have you read with me. I want to say a word about Tommy Osborne. I've been in his meetings. He was in brother Brandham's meeting, I believe, when the maniac fell at brother Brandham's feet. What he has said, don't don't put it up yet. What he has said is what he believed in his heart. He spoke these words at Brother Brandon's memorial service. and Billy Paul. And if Billy Paul hears this service, thank you, brother Billy Paul, for having this man stand up because I feel that he was a voice at least for those people to let the world and let them be condemned by their own statement. &gt;&gt; This is what they looked on brother Brandham and his message as. And it's not us &gt;&gt; declaring it. It's him declaring it what he honestly believed and some of his statements are perhaps stronger than I have even used behind this pulpit. So I want you to hear it and absorb it more than just a reading. These are his This is his message and I've added it way down and abridged it and he's talking about brother Brandham's ministry. Can you just tell me is this Where's the clicker? I'm sorry. Thank you. It's talking about the brother Brown's ministry now and it has blown across the face of this uh our generation a fresh breath of God in this 20th century through the extraordinary ministry of God's prophet to this age the man recognized among among us by the name of William Brham. This little man because of the gift of God for ordained in his life lived and ministered completely interpenetrated with heaven and earth transcending both the seen and the unseen worlds at the same time. He couldn't help it. He couldn't avoid it. We were privileged to keep let's say now this is in quotation marks because this is someone who attended the meetings and wrote like perhaps a reporter, a Christian reporter and and here's what they said and when I come to the end I'll tell you but this was in with in Tail Osbbor's sermon. We were privileged to keep only five glorious days and nights of this celestial vigil but the effect of those memorial memorable days live on today. The people were left humbled and tendered because they know that Jesus of Nazareth had passed our way in his servant. For that holy pause, we had seemingly turned back the pages of time and joined the admiring host of followers that shuffled along the dusty trails of Galilee in faithful devotion to a lowly carpenter who claimed to be the Messiah of Israel. He's likening himself now to the what they've read in the scripture. In our visionary procession, we had passed by the place of the tombs, which erupted by a a naked demonic and screaming and hissing his objection to the presence of Christ, but sat at his feet a moment later, clothed and in his right mind. We were among the jostling mob around Jesus when he asked the abrupt question, "Who touched me?" and saw a trembling little woman cast herself at his feet and declared before all the people of what uh for what cause she had pulled at the border of his robe and how she had been healed immediately. And then we followed on to Gyrus's house and saw the raising of his daughter. We heard the plain words of a deaf and dumb child after his tongue was loosed by the master's touch and laughed to see the lame man leap for joy. We clamorred for a seaside seat with the 5,000 other men who had forsaken the anvil and the hammer and closed the doors of their shops to spend the day hours in wrapped listening to the wonderful teachings of this divine philosopher. We wept with the women as we gazed on the beautiful face and recognized the sorrow and the grief that spoke of the broken heart and felt that melting charming sensation that one glance from his kind eyes could bring to the soul. Yes, Bible days were here again. And here was a man who practiced what we preached. I say this not to exalt any human, but only to emphasize that our deep appreciation for our brother stem from the fact that his ministry seemed to bring our lover Lord Jes Lord closer to us and to better acquaint us with his living works, his personality, his deity than anything had before. God has chosen divers and mysterious ways. Now, this is TL Osborne carrying on. Now, he's finished with the article. God has chosen divers in mysterious ways to reveal himself to his servants, especially to those called for dispensational purposes as brother Brandham was called. It certainly would not be strange then that in this way he appeared to brother Brham. In short, the man we know as William Brham was sent to demonstrate God again in the flesh. But why was he sent to do this? And why all of these signs had not Jesus already done these things? Have they not already been written and recorded? Yes, absolutely. They had all been done before and men had forgotten them. So God willingly, more abundantly to show us the immutability of his counsel did it again in the 20th century. He did it again and I beheld his glory. He could have done it in the 18th century, but he did it while I was here. &gt;&gt; This gospel of the kingdom was to be preached as a witness to all nations and then the end would come. But what was this gospel of the kingdom? The church had forgotten. It was a generation where although many of them were religious and sincere and many of them were hungry and seeking and but yet they had forgotten what it really was like. This was the closing generation. Something had to happen. It couldn't go as past generations had gone. Therefore, in God's divine mercy, something somehow stepping beyond the bounds of ordinary measure, he had fore ordained at this hour to send again this prophet. Some are going to think that I am sacriiggious or off doctrally and it doesn't really matter. But God, he thought that one over. But God came again in human flesh and said, "Apparently, I must show them again. I must remind them again. They must see sometime once again. They must know what God is like." And he stepped down and sent a little man, a prophet, but more than a prophet. this time a Jesus man. This time Elijah was not that. This is more than that which he we have beheld. Moses was not that for because of the different dispensation in which he lived. It couldn't be what we have seen. More than that, a Jesus man, a man full of God, but sent as a special sign to a generation. in this generation a gener a supernatural sign an extraordinary measure. &gt;&gt; Why? It was done before. Why do it again? To arouse this last generation once more to be the forerunner once more to be sure that the record is clear. To be sure that there is no excuse. Thus 1,200 tapes, &gt;&gt; thus thousands of revelations of the hearts of the people &gt;&gt; and you have access to it. And to be sure that God has demonstrated a fresh to be sure that they can there can be no mistake. And to be sure that we are reminded aresh of what God is like how Jesus was and what God does in the flesh. &gt;&gt; God willing to be sure that we don't fail in the knowledge of the immutability of his covenant. did it again in the 20th century. That generation destined to bring him back. This generation must know, this generation must be without excuse. So he sent forth a particular human vessel surrounded by supernatural signs to attract attention and to make this wayward generation look up, ponder, search, and think. Thus the halo of light that appeared at his birth, the star, the angel, the discernment, the gifts, all of these were given for that purpose. For what? To show us God again to repent, to repeat rather what he showed us in Jesus Christ when he came in the form of flesh and to remind us one final time like Jesus. Brother Vanom red demonstrated the very thing which made man believe that the true Messiah had come. &gt;&gt; He was a seer. &gt;&gt; He saw. He lived in both worlds and seen and seen and the unseen at the same time and transcended both of them practically all the time. Jesus said, "My father workketh hither too and I work. The son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do. Here comes brother Brandham along in the 20th century and does exactly the same way. God in the flesh again crossing our path and many did not know. They would not have known him if he would have been here when God crossed their path in the body that we call Jesus Christ. God who had chosen us comes down in the flesh once again to say, "I must show them again what I'm like." So that they will go with renewed zeal and remember a fresh my living word cannot change. That it is always the same. I must go and show them again. And he came down here in the form of the flesh. I'm saying this corregation. I'm feeling rather weak. I feel so expended. I feel so moved. When you thought the message, when you thought the message and you hear about it here, hither and yawn and what they're doing and what someone else are doing and what their home is like and what their church is like, that doesn't mean anything to us. God has left us without excuse. &gt;&gt; And this is a man who hasn't even seen what you've seen. He came down in the gain in the form of flesh as we call him William Brandom. He came across our generation, crossed our path, told us these words from the scriptures and we are to believe these words. We have walked with God in our day. He came and walked the shores of Galilee. But he also come to the streets of Phoenix, Portland, Portland, Oregon, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and across this nation. I saw it. He said, and when I was when I saw it once, I knew what it meant. This was the word in flesh. &gt;&gt; I could take it up and go with it. For God was with me and in me. &gt;&gt; What a revelation. That's what he got out of it. &gt;&gt; He didn't get, "Oh, now I just got to go and make Brother somebody." No. God made him somebody. &gt;&gt; He came to demonstrate what God was like in the flesh to say to you, "You do it. &gt;&gt; You live it." &gt;&gt; This is God's will for this last generation. Now, you do it. I'm saying to you young and old, all of us here on the internet, all whoever may see it in the archive, I send out this challenge. Let us do it. &gt;&gt; Let us carry this last word to the far corners of the globe. Let us expend our energy and our life. And I say to you young people, you will never never regret it. &gt;&gt; You might have success. You might have fame in the world. You might become a great musician or a great athlete or something else that will rot with your body, &gt;&gt; but what you do for Christ will last for all eternity. &gt;&gt; What a revelation. And now will you do what will you do about this message that has been pointed out so clearly to you? That's him. That's DL Osborne speaking. What shall you do with it? Shall we run with it? &gt;&gt; Shall we act upon it? &gt;&gt; Shall we bear it to the ends of the world? God has visited his people &gt;&gt; for a great prophet has risen up amongst us &gt;&gt; and I'm through. I've even asked God recently. I'm not a young man. I probably feel more burned and more pressed and more energized You don't have to stand behind the pulpit. I admire what I see and people that have witnessed that have been an example of this message. I admire you. I love your testimony. I love the testimony this church. And I say to this church, Cloverdale Bible Way, whatever you do, don't release. Don't slacken. &gt;&gt; Don't release. Don't give it any slack at all. Keep it Keep the cords snugged up tight. &gt;&gt; Keep the standard high. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Keep the standard high. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want nothing to do with this world. This world is falling apart. &gt;&gt; We don't want to look like them. We don't want to talk like them. We don't want to enjoy what they enjoy. &gt;&gt; We're a God people. I say on the basis of this word, we're a Jesus people. &gt;&gt; The true Jesus people. &gt;&gt; And that's what the hippies desired. They wanted to be a Jesus people. They didn't know it, but there is a Jesus people. &gt;&gt; And by God's divine, God came back. &gt;&gt; God came back, folks. &gt;&gt; God just stepped in. And I feel he stepped into this service in a special divine way. And don't miss your chance. Don't miss your opportunity. Say, "All to Jesus I surrender. &gt;&gt; All to him I freely give. &gt;&gt; I'll forever love and serve him. &gt;&gt; And in his presence daily live." Father, oh, what a time. What a day we're in. The world's all caught up in a lot of tensil and nonsense. And sin will increase even over this season. And they've missed they've missed it all. They missed the meaning of they even missed the day. They missed the time of the year. Your prophet comes and tells us he's a lamb. He's born in the spring. Born in a barn. All lambs are born in a barn. Lord Jesus, I didn't finish this message and you know what was left. I've read the words of a man that didn't go on and follow. But he left a record. A record. And his voice he will hear it all played again. of what he said and I'll hear my voice and I say even now, Father, I feel like I'm in a special protected place. Just you and me. You'll have me hear these words again. And I want to say I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is the power of God unto salvation. Lord, there may be somebody here. I feel that there is. I wonder if there's somebody here and God is moving on you and you want to raise your hand as I want you to pray for me. I want to give my all. I haven't surrendered myself completely, but I want to give my all. Yes. God bless you. God bless you. Bless you. Father, you see the hearts. You weigh it out. Some perhaps need forgiveness. put a spirit of repentance in their heart. Even raising their hand, they're showing that I want to I want to go on. I want to give my all. Lord, take this sacrifice. Take this offering. Take these precious lives, dear ones. They're your children. You called them here. And now you're calling their name. Even through this service, they're seeing something. They're feeling something. Perhaps they cannot explain it entirely, but they know it's you that's calling and all they can say they just lift their hand or their hands say here am I Lord even as it was when Mary stood outside of the tomb outside of the sephilar she couldn't even even hadn't really identified you and and maybe some have come here and they've sat in the meetings and said yes I'm a believer and I know William Brandham's a prophet of God, but they don't realize really it was you speaking through him. And it was you until until she heard Mary, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Mary. And when she heard that, she responded, "Rabbon, my master." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And now that's what we are asking that there be a response now within the people. You've called my name. You've called my name. And I'm responding in the name of Jesus Christ. I give myself to you. Will you that raise your hands, you just say that to yourself. You don't have to say it to me, but you say it and speak it out of your mouth and say it to the Lord. Here am I. I've heard thy voice. Let's stand. I am thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy voice. And then I want to sing one of brother Derek if you can come, would you please? And uh like to sing uh what was it? He called my name. I heard his name. Yeah, I heard. But we're saying I am thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy voice. Let's just remain real real now. The service is not over. I'm thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy voice and it told thy love to me. &gt;&gt; I am thy. I have heard thy voice and is thy love to me. But I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee. Call me nearer, nearer, nearer. Blessed Lord to the cross ther blessed Lord to thy preious leading You know my name. And before we sing, I said I would say a little more about this. I'm not going to say any more about it. Please take some. Please send them out. Tail Osburn saying now it's not Tail Osborne. It's my I'm saying now what will we do with the message? Let's send it out. Let's get it out. And You know, you give your gifts and your tithings and your offerings. And I want you to know where we seek to be real good stewards. We've got wonderful trustees and I watch over the income. We don't have we don't have a lot of money. We're we just go along from month to month. But God has always provided. Isn't that wonderful? I was just at brother Lonnie Jenkins memorial service and I came outside. I was sitting in my car and a a little sister came over and she was so frail she was stooped over. Her son who was probably in his mid-50s was standing behind her in case she would fall. My wife rolled down the window and her mouth was shaking. Her bottom jaw was shaking. She said, "But I've known her for probably 35 years. Her husband's passed away." She said, "But do you do still do mission work?" I said, "Oh, yes." She handed me a check for $4,000. She said, "Somebody gave us a cousin gave us an inheritance and here's some of the money." I wanted to go to missions. And I thought, "God bless that sister." They they gave and supported. Otherwise, we could never have been on radio. We could never have cleaned up the tent. We could never have done what brother Tim Dodd now has taken. And I'm so thankful because this is this is the very grassroots of this congregation. And I've said to you many times if God has blessed this work, he's blessed it for one reason. That you are a testimony and that our heart, our whole passion is get it out. Find that last one. Oh, I' I'd love to cross over with this congregation and have our Lord Jesus say and maybe his messenger standing right behind beside him because he was the last one in his right hand. &gt;&gt; The last one was the seventh one. &gt;&gt; The last one was Elijah and have him standing there and say, "Welcome home. You helped to bring the last one in." &gt;&gt; Even if it was somebody in the congregation that witnessed, I would just be so happy. God say, "Oh, praise God. Praise God. We help to bring the last." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't think I'm off up here. I'm I'm very much very much aware of everything that's taking place. God bless you. You that raised your hands expected to be different. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As of this moment. Let's sing this song together with spirit. &gt;&gt; He knows my name. How is the words? How do the words go? I have a maker. Okay, not too slow now. I he my heart and &gt;&gt; he even know my all my every single I have a father. Isn't that wonderful? Because we still he my know my every heart and hear me. He knows my name. He knows my name. every single Just a moment. I'm not doing this. I just want to say on Monday night, next Monday, not tomorrow, but a week. Tomorrow is New Year's Eve, we'll be here thanking God. And I just have it on my heart. So, I'm just asking I would like to have the Russian people that are here that will be here to sing and give glory to God. The Philippine people and my wife are speaking. We loved it the last time you sang. Get get them together. Brother Leon and you get with brother Ryan or whoever and just Amen. Glorify God. The Chinese people, you have more now. Praise the Lord. You come and sing. the Congalles people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a rejoicing time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It'll be a prelude to heaven. &gt;&gt; And if we don't make it to New Year's, we'll have it on the other side. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, we'll sing, we'll shout, we'll rejoice. Glory to God. We'll hug one another. Praise the Lord. I might even hug some of your sisters over there. Don't freeze up. Brother Brandham said they hugged him. Is that what they said? There's no sensation whatsoever. That's on the other side. Glory to God. We're going to cry. We're going to rejoice. And the king will come out &gt;&gt; and wipe the tears. Say, "Never mind. It's over, children." Yeah. The labors are all done. God bless you. God bless the school. God bless the Sunday school. God bless you, brother Richard, Brother Tatch, all the teachers, and some of them are away now. God bless you. We'll just we'll just sing it once again. He knows my name. And then, Brother Tom, would you come and dismiss us? I'm glad he knows he knows my name. He knows my heart. I will be my God. and let's pray. Hallelujah. Glory, Lord. How many of us felt like the gunner? How many of us felt alone, Lord? &gt;&gt; How many of us didn't know which way to go and all hell was against us? Lord, what a change came by when Jesus came by our way. As our prophet said, then Jesus came and called, changed the whole atmosphere around us. Lord, we believe that atmosphere has changed this morning. Oh God, maybe that last one is here this morning. That would be so wonderful. Lord, the beckoning of the Holy Spirit dealing with lives. Then Jesus came down. What a Christmas. &gt;&gt; What a Christmas this is. What a gift. Lord, come to the house of God and God would come down. Bless us with his presence and the word. What a gift it is to my soul. Lord, as we go our way, we think on these things. I felt like Mary this morning and you just spoke to my name and I realize you're so near, Lord. &gt;&gt; Always running, always looking, but God, you're present. So, as the saints of God leave, would you go with them? And as they go in their car, may they speak of you. And as they'll have their time with their families, may the presence of God come down. May be a different Christmas, Lord. May they realize the gift of God that is present. Would you bless your children? Would you strengthen our dear pastor? We have cherished this gift Lord and we have thanked you many times over the years and we are not ashamed to stand with men of God held the banner high. We will stand shouldertosh shoulder &gt;&gt; and we shall thus hold the banner high. Lord go with your people. May they go with your blessing as we commit our ways to you now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. Have a wonderful time with your families, with friends. Don't forget if those like to come on Friday night, we're going to have just an open basically an open house fellowship here in the fellowship room at 7:00 Friday night. You're all invited. God bless you. Greet one another. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Father round.
