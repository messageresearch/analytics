God bless you, brother Jason. Thanking you. Amen. Why don't we just sing the same God as our brother John comes to ask a blessing over the offering and as the brothers prepare to bring that same God.

We just want to give us unto the Lord as part of worship. If you have something you'd like to give for the for our camp, just expenses of our camp. I know the Lord would appreciate your worship. It's part of our worship. Amen. We'll bow our heads. Lord Jesus, there just seems to have been a sacredness expectation for these meetings, God. Even for this week, Lord, as you spoke to your disciples to come aside, Lord, and you spoke to them, I pray that as we've come aside from the world, and even tonight, Lord, our hearts are just beating with anticipation. I know it's just unanimous throughout this building. Lord, we're here for one purpose, and that is for you to be lifted up. Lord, &gt;&gt; we want our lives to be emptied out of the world and out of oursel. We don't want to be caught up with looking around or to one another, but we want to look to Jesus, take off any mass that would not be true. We just want to look into your face and have you speak your word into our lives. Whatever we have need of, we just pray that you would come individually. &gt;&gt; You're such a great God that you know how to come down in a little way, small way to each one of us so that we understand.

How many want to thank him for what he's done already in camp? How many want to lift up your hands and your voice and say, "Lord, your presence has been so real and you've moved so wonderfully. We just come tonight just to worship in your presence one more time to let the man of God come behind that sacred pulpit that the word of God would come and that it would do a supernatural work and continue to move within our lives. &gt;&gt; Father, There's something in our hearts. I want to say, "Welcome, welcome, Holy Spirit. We welcome thee tonight." We pray you'll take your servant in a wonderful way. We pray, God, as we sit on the edge of our seat, that we will not see man, but we will see God once again coming on the scene, meeting needs, changing hearts, delivering souls. Lord, we say have your will &gt;&gt; in every way. But you take your servant now &gt;&gt; and use him mightily &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; We want to welcome the Ron Spencer once again this evening to minister the word of God to our hearts and to our souls.

Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; as I hear the prophet of God say, you brother, you sister, &gt;&gt; he's come to you just now. &gt;&gt; You have a welcome spirit. You welcomed him and he came. &gt;&gt; Lord, here on this Saturday evening tonight, &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you for what you've done in the meeting so far. &gt;&gt; But here we stand in this moment of time. This service could change our lives forever. Oh God, tonight we bring our needs before you just now &gt;&gt; come by our way. Oh God, &gt;&gt; come by where we're at, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, you know our needs. We don't even have to express it, but you know our needs. &gt;&gt; And Lord, what we're lacking tonight is more of you. There's not a one in this building or under the sound of my voice that don't need more of you. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray that we could enter into the inner veil. that every demon and principality and power would be bound, every chain of darkness, every spirit that would be against the word of the Lord would be brought down in the name of Jesus Christ. Sound a jubilee tonight in our ears, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're a slave no longer. Oh God, I pray that you would just come and anoint your vessel. &gt;&gt; Anoint your children tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, we welcome you here just now. &gt;&gt; Forgive us of all of our sins and our attitudes. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, minister to us. &gt;&gt; I just pray we're worthy Lord by your blood in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I believe that he's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you will turn with me this evening to Luke chapter 9 verse 26 this afternoon. You had a good time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Luke chapter 9 verse 26. I would like to look this evening. I started this in Edmonton. Of course, you never get finished on the last service. I'd like to look at the dispute over our body. Luke 9 verse 26. For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come into his own glory, and in his fathers, and of the holy angels. But I yet tell you of a truth, that there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, &gt;&gt; till they see the kingdom of God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass about 8 days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray. And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raignment was white and glistening. And behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias, who appeared in glory, and spake of his deceas, which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep. And when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him. And it came to pass as they dis departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here, let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias, not knowing what he said. And while he thus spake, there came a cloud and overshadowed them. And they feared as they entered into the cloud. And there came a voice out of the cloud saying, "This is my beloved son. Hear him." &gt;&gt; Jude verse 9. And and if you'll just hang there just a moment and I'll read this one scripture for you. While Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil, he disputed about the body of Moses, dur not bring against him a railing accusation, but saith the Lord rebuke thee. You may be seated this evening. Scriptures that are very pertinent to our hour and very upto-date. I I'd like to share them with you. Revelations 12 and verse 7. And there was a war in heaven. And Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not. Neither was their found anymore in heaven, their place in heaven anymore in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world. And he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, "Now is come salvation and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ. For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which did accuse them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto death. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We believe it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Revelations 5 and verse one. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And right there the denominations are already lost. &gt;&gt; Now they don't have a clue. But a bride has been has an open book. &gt;&gt; And I saw a strong angel procla proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? No man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read. No prophet, no angel, no king, &gt;&gt; no potentate, no ambassador, no Hollywood star, &gt;&gt; none of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And one of the elders said unto me, "Weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book." Brother B said, "Our names," not only were the mysteries of God in there, but our names was in that book. and to loose the seven seals. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the spirits of God, sent forth into the earth. And he came, and he took the book out of the right hand that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, and the fourth beast, and the 24 elders, fell down before the lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vows full of odors, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sung a new song, and we can. &gt;&gt; Thou art worthy to take the book. &gt;&gt; How many times we sing it, thou art worthy, &gt;&gt; thou art worthy, oh God, to take the book, and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God by the blood and by every kindred tongue and people and nation. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love the Lord this evening? &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us? &gt;&gt; Luke chapter nine just very very hastily. And it came to pass after eight days these sayings. He took Peter and John and James and went into the mountain to pray. And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered. And his raignment was white and glistening. And behold, there talked two men which were Moses and Elias who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. I just want to lay a few foundation things here if I if I may. Here stands two representatives, the law and the prophets. Elijah being the elder servant, the very spirit of Christ himself. Moses being a man that is called the greatest prophet to ever live of the Old Testament. Here's a man that literally becomes the mouthpiece of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's a man that the that he begins to write the first five books of the Bible and he goes back into Adam and he watches God create the heavens and the earth and and it was good and he watches the evolution of how God evolutes and how that he he creates every every seed every seed of every grass every flower. He watches the whole zodiac come into position. Moses is watching this and he's being anointed to write these things down, maybe not understanding even maybe a tenth of what he's even writing down. And then God begins to evolute even to the highest species, which was his very image. Let us make man in our own image. And he created Adam a spirit being. And and they had incredible fellowship. and and and he created him a perfect paradise for him to be the keeper over and to to to rule the atmosphere and the animals and and and we realize that there had been war in heaven and Satan was cast into the earth. So as an amateur god, he was the keeper of all of that. And so we realize as and I'm just going to make a leap here just now. He he we realize is he he takes his place with his wife. And brother Brandon said he was not deceived. His eyes were wide open. He takes his place with his wife in the fall. &gt;&gt; Knowing that God would kill her. You see that was an attribute laying on the inside of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He longed to have a wife. He would be a kinsman redeemer &gt;&gt; and Adam would leave the presence of God. But before he would leave the presence of God, God would give him a covenant &gt;&gt; that the woman's seed will bruise the head of that serpent. &gt;&gt; And God in in even the garden promises Calvary. Amen. &gt;&gt; We heard last night as Adam and Eve are walking out of the garden and the bloody sheep skins are slapping around their legs and the blood is dripping down off off of them. God moves. And one place, Brother Brandham says, Brother Brandham says, "I'll go with you." &gt;&gt; I will go with you &gt;&gt; as a promise. I'll come as your kinsman redeemer. Adam, I'll restore you back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All of his rulership, all of his control. Adam knew never knew what it was to sweat. He never knew what it was to have an agony. He never knew what it was to have a backachche. He never knew what it was for the literally the the the grass to be and the and the thistles and the thorns. He never knew what it was to turn the ground. He never knew what it was to have animals to now turn to pray upon him. &gt;&gt; He never knew the things that you fight right here tonight. &gt;&gt; He never knew time element. &gt;&gt; He never had to be in a hurry. &gt;&gt; He never had to worry. He never had to to struggle with personal feelings. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he leaves the Garden of Eden now, this this chain of sin begins to come upon his life. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; As a little child, we begin to read and brother Brown uses a text called Teaching on Moses. He begins to he begins to deal with us all as children. Just forgive me for taking just a little while to lay this in, but he begins to take a text of of of Moses's mother and father. They had now been in Egypt for about 400 years. And it was more than a legend. And it was more than a story that God came to Abraham and sit with him lip to ear. and he blew a body and stepped in. This man having no father or mother &gt;&gt; and and God spoke to Abraham how their ch his children, how he would be the father of nations, how he would how that his children would go into to slavery into bondship and it would be about 400 years. But God promised that he would send them a deliverer. And so and so, but remember there's some covenant that is made with Abraham. Thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of this is laid in their mind and it's carried from one generation to another generation. And they begin to teach teach this to another generation as I read the text last night. I am the God of Abraham. I am the God of Isaac. I am the God of Jacob. I am the God of Joseph. And it came down 400 years. And brother Brandham said, Joseph, looking at his death, said, "Don't you bury me here. &gt;&gt; Don't you bury me down here in Egypt, you carry my bones. &gt;&gt; You carry my bones back to the promised land." He said a many a many of Jewish slave Israelites would walk by walk by that lead casket &gt;&gt; and they'd lay their hands over on that lead casket and said Joseph's dry bones laying on the inside of that casket laying crumpled up in that casket said they'd lay their hands on that lead casket and with a promise in their heart. &gt;&gt; What are these days? &gt;&gt; We have a promise. &gt;&gt; We're not going to be down here in Egypt forever. &gt;&gt; This is not our forever existence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not going to be here forever. &gt;&gt; We didn't bury this in the ground. We've got this above ground that one of these days we're going to carry this coffin. &gt;&gt; He said they'd walk by with their their back with stripes all over where they had been beat by their taskmaster. They had struggled through their days. No doubt watching their family famish in many different ways. struggles of life, but they lay their hands on that casket. &gt;&gt; It was their covenant with God. &gt;&gt; Our God, &gt;&gt; their covenant with God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was a man named Amra. &gt;&gt; He was Moses's father. A revelation be to strike in his heart. predestinated. &gt;&gt; He begin to feel the pull of the hour. &gt;&gt; And it was just more than a chronological order. But he begin to feel the pull of the hour and he begin when he come in from work, Brother Bram said he would climb up in his little attic and he would call on Jehovah. &gt;&gt; He would cry out to God. &gt;&gt; You promised. You promised us a deliverer. &gt;&gt; You promised my great great granddaddy Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You promised Jacob. You promised Joseph. &gt;&gt; You promised me. &gt;&gt; It's good when we can get on our face &gt;&gt; and have a private interview with God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; One night, one night while in prayer, an angel of the Lord came and gave him specific instructions. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How that he was going to send the deliverer through his home. The scripture bears out the baby would be born. They couldn't keep the baby. because Pharaoh would kill it because it knew there was a certain time order. A deliverer was coming. He would kill the babies. So God has an incredible sense of humor. Said, "Put the baby in the basket. Put tar all over this basket. I want you to take it and put it in that crocodile infested waters." Gabriel, I I need you to come and stand on this basket. &gt;&gt; I need you to line up 10,000 angels up and down this water. &gt;&gt; I need you as this basket weaves its way down this waterway and the and the alligators comes up and and the other animals would come up to take a nip of it. Gabriel, you take your foot and you push them back down. &gt;&gt; No doubt they didn't have an idea. Those animals didn't have an idea that something could hit them like that. &gt;&gt; You see, they held dominion, but this little lad inside of this basket &gt;&gt; was a prophet from his birth. He'd wind up in the house of Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; He would grow up with personal ambition. &gt;&gt; With incredible education. &gt;&gt; He would sit at the right hand of Pharaoh and kind of even become an architect and an engineer and and be able to be in the in the decision making of how things work. &gt;&gt; But his mother had laid a foundation. She had laid a foundation and told him of a testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And she'd carry him through. &gt;&gt; She'd carry him through the scriptures. &gt;&gt; And she'd talk about Jehovah meeting Abraham who was his shield, his buckler, the name changer. Jacob wrestled with the angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Saw a ladder come down. Hallelujah. Joseph, Joseph and all his portrayal how that he came and and and all of that and he began to lay in a prison 19 years &gt;&gt; listen not knowing what he was doing but God preserved life for us &gt;&gt; we've been here 400 brother said and due to the lapse of the condition of the age there was a lapse of time he said because it was so wicked and he said and he says he says now no doubt She laid it in his heart. And let me just say this to you. Many times we as parents do our very best to lay it in your hearts &gt;&gt; and it becomes quotes and scriptures and pictures on the wall and powerful sermons. But we need God to take that word and make it live. Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture says in Hebrews chapter 11, by faith Moses, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer the affliction. You know, when Paul is is anointed to write that scripture, if we're not careful, we don't take in the 40 years of the human struggle. 40 years of molding, &gt;&gt; getting Egypt out of Moses, &gt;&gt; 40 years of teaching Moses a lesson, &gt;&gt; cuz God's not in a great big hurry. Right. &gt;&gt; We get in a hurry. God's not in a great big hurry. &gt;&gt; He's got to get a man willing to submit himself totally to God. &gt;&gt; Before he can send him with a donkey and his wife and a child and go into Egypt as a one-man invasion, he's got to have him 100% submitted to God. Now, now we realize they were under the blood of bulls and goats. He could feel the spirit of God, but he didn't have something in him to make him live, right? &gt;&gt; Get anointed. But we can very quickly point pick out in the scriptures that Moses was hightempered. Moses was stubborn. Probably nobody in the building suffers from any of those things. But Moses as he begins to watch how God had with had a relationship with Adam, no doubt he envied that position. And in his entire life, whether it was standing before Pharaoh and watching his staff be turned into a serpent and swallow up their serpents as he as he calls for plagues and watches those things happen. As he goes to to a red sea and watches watches God preserve two million people and open up the sea to which to which they walk across on dry land. Even theologians today still can't get that figured out. But with our God, he can do anything. &gt;&gt; Go across and go through a desert and travel 40 years in that desert. Never, as we said last night, never building a Walmart, which is phenomenal. Never having to buy new shoes, never having to have new clothes. Are you with me now? Amen. &gt;&gt; But listen, he watched all of that humanity come and he heard their murmuring. He heard their complaining. He saw their idol worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even constructing the temple exactly like he had saw it in heaven and watch the continent sending of God come down. A pillar of fire, a cloud. He had been in the very presence of God when God took his finger and wrote upon the stones. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had been there, brother Tim, when God held him in the cliff of a rock, &gt;&gt; because it was Moses's desire, &gt;&gt; it was his desire to see God, &gt;&gt; after all that God did, &gt;&gt; through his life, &gt;&gt; through his hands, &gt;&gt; through his vocal cords, &gt;&gt; he still wanted to see God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Moses struggled with something that me and you struggle with one another. Shock. Come on. &gt;&gt; It disappointed him to hear murmuring. &gt;&gt; It disappointed him to see people do the wrong things. &gt;&gt; But yet in his disappointment, God says, "Pull back Moses. I'm going to destroy him." He said, "Hey, hey, wait a minute. They're your people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They're your children. &gt;&gt; And the same guy that will stand in the breach. &gt;&gt; Satan anoints his flesh. &gt;&gt; Just like he anoints your flesh. &gt;&gt; And in that crisis, you you're not married. Some of you are not married. But let me just say this to you. You will overcome every devil in hell and then go home. &gt;&gt; Come on. And the queen of your life &gt;&gt; who has changed diapers all day long. Goo and God and &gt;&gt; will push the wrong button. &gt;&gt; And as much as you have deity laying on the inside of you, your flesh &gt;&gt; will disappoint you. You see, there's a dispute for your body going on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Moses, no doubt. No doubt doubt in my mind. Listen, once he left his house, which Brother Ram says it must have been a time back there on the back side of the desert. &gt;&gt; Zapora with a high temper. Let me just say this to you. Him being a prophet didn't impress her a whole lot. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; I read a story here a while back that there was a president of America back in the 30s. And I don't call his name. I'm not here for politics. But his mother-in-law always hated him. He never could please his mother-in-law. She thought he wasn't good enough for her daughter. here. He was a president of the United States. He was a statesman. And yet he wasn't good enough for her daughter. He said there was never peace in his own home. I'm sure Moses kind of felt like that a day or two in his life. &gt;&gt; Is there a spot anywhere where there's peace at? &gt;&gt; I got a reason. Here we go. Two men are at this conference. The other one is is Elijah. He was a man born of woman just like you and I. Sins of the fathers passed down to him. Spirit of God anoints his life even from a child. He raises up and God anoints him in an incredible way. You see, when Joshua destroyed the children of Israel destroyed destroyed Jericho, Joshua stood there and cursed the man that would rebuild &gt;&gt; this city. &gt;&gt; It so happens in Elijah's days, there's a political uprising that comes on the scene. Israel is in a backsliding condition and Ahab goes to the throne and he marries an idolatrous woman named Jezebel. &gt;&gt; And one of the things that Ahab does that brings the judgment of God on him, he commisss a man to go and rebuild Jericho. And if you'll notice within just only just a couple of scriptures, here comes Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's a covenant written with Joshua. I'll curse the man. &gt;&gt; I'll curse the man that rebuilds the city. There's a reason. Just up on that hill is going to be the mount of transfiguration. And so here here here comes a here comes Ahab and he has it rebuilt. Has him to re start reconstructing. And here comes the prophet of God and he says it will not even rain or do fall until I call for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Immediately he becomes unpopular. You see, the nation had came to a spot where it had forgot God. &gt;&gt; And they had begun to build strange denominational idoltor worshippers. &gt;&gt; Oh, they had their bail. &gt;&gt; Oh, they had their emotional time. Oh, they had their great speakers. &gt;&gt; They had men that was incredible speakers that could come and stand. They had schools of the prophets and and they would come. But God sent them a mouthpiece called Elijah. &gt;&gt; He was the very voice of God through a human vessel. &gt;&gt; But listen, even in that voice, here was a man. Here was a man that was moody. &gt;&gt; Here's a man that struggle with his own flesh &gt;&gt; even after the day. And you know these stories very well, but I'm just rehearsing them just for a few minutes. Even after after he stands before Israel and declares unto them, let's see who really is God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's see who really is God. &gt;&gt; Let's see who God is with. &gt;&gt; If he is with Baal, let's all serve him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let the God that answers by fire. &gt;&gt; Watch what they do. They build their altars. &gt;&gt; Listen. And their altars is very close to God's altar. &gt;&gt; And they get and they begin to worship and they begin to whoop it up. They begin to cry. And Elijah gets anointed. &gt;&gt; It's dangerous when a man of God gets anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. He gets anointed and he begins to make fun of him. &gt;&gt; Your God must be on vacation. &gt;&gt; Your God's not answering you. You need to scream a little bit louder. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they did everything and begin to cut themselves. &gt;&gt; And Elijah, when they were done and they were exhausted and their time was up, Elijah tore down their altar. Hallelujah. He tore down their their idolatrous worship. &gt;&gt; We need to tear down every bit of denominational ideas, &gt;&gt; every school of thinking. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The things that we hang on to that's not according to the word of God. The carryover that just tear it down. &gt;&gt; Just completely surrender ourselves to the word of God. &gt;&gt; He tore down those altars. He rebuilt that altar. Let me just say this. The greatest thing you can do in your home. If your home has lost its revival, if it's lost its prayer, if it's lost the voice of the prophet of God has become a stranger in your house, rebuild the altar. &gt;&gt; Rebuild the altar. &gt;&gt; How long has it been? &gt;&gt; How long has it been since you felt the presence of God in your home? I'm not just talking about at church. I'm not just talking about in your pew. How long has it been since he came? &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm going to preach to you. Here we are. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I tell you what we'll do. &gt;&gt; We'll buy a book for our financials and we'll we'll we'll we'll go this guy's got a great idea and he's got an answer and it's got 500 pages in it. We'll give $50 for it. And he's only got a theory. &gt;&gt; We'll go to the self-help sections. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; And we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll read what a psychologist says, &gt;&gt; perverted in his mind. And we'll begin to think how to raise children. &gt;&gt; If we're not careful, we'll go to some some trinitarian &gt;&gt; school of thinking. how to raise children. &gt;&gt; And before long, Dr. Dobson's in our home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Dr. Dobson's ruling our lives. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Some denominational idea. We're not raising denominational chickens here. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, but I want to keep my children out of drugs. And I I want to keep them away from the wrong kind of friends. I want them to get the spirit of God. I want them to know this message. Keep them in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Keep them in the presence of God. Your home was given to you. &gt;&gt; It was given to you. Are you with me now? I'm a littlehead now. It was given to you for your sanctuary. When you come home from the day and all the cares of life are over with, you come in, you walk in, you're in fellowship with your wife, you two come into relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring your children into that atmosphere &gt;&gt; that they call this place home and not a prison. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, there should never be a marriage counseling seminars. &gt;&gt; Our home should be so strong by the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me just say we should not tolerate even losing one of our children to drugs. one of our children to the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, I want every one of you to make it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for a percentage to go out of here. I want every one of you. &gt;&gt; I'm not satisfied. They find Elijah in a cave. A cave despondent. And only God can bring him out of his depression. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I know nobody here suffers from depression. nervousness, but they're chains from hell. God would find his prophet under a juniper tree, under a juniper tree. Here he was and he was praying. You know, sometimes we as human beings, we would quit if we could. Yes, sir. We'd quit if we could. &gt;&gt; If we could quit, we'd quit because that's our natural flesh. &gt;&gt; We We say, "I have had enough. &gt;&gt; I have had enough." &gt;&gt; Elijah got himself under a juniper tree. And he began to cry out to God, "Let me die like my fathers." God didn't have plannings for dying ever in his life. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, in God's big picture, Elijah's never going to die. &gt;&gt; But here's a man &gt;&gt; that hasn't seen, I'm going to ride off in a chariot in a few days. &gt;&gt; He hasn't caught the revelation. So, he's praying completely against the will of God. Let me die. &gt;&gt; Let me die like my fathers. And God calls the angels. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he searches all through heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he says, I want the angel with the softest hands. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want the angel with the softest hands. &gt;&gt; I want you to come here and I want you to rub Elijah's brow. He's having a bad day. &gt;&gt; I want you to rubbish blow. &gt;&gt; I want the best cook in all of heaven. &gt;&gt; He searched through Virginia. &gt;&gt; Through the Shannondoa Valley. &gt;&gt; It was close. He went through Chef Raymond. It was close. He went through your community and it was close &gt;&gt; and he found the angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That was the best cake maker. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And said, "Bake him some cakes." &gt;&gt; Let me show you what a condition Elijah was in. &gt;&gt; God had to wake him up and serve him by angels. And he went right back to sleep. wake him up and serve him by angels. And he went right back to sleep. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; They preached some incredible sermons while they were on in life. Forgive me for my folly for a couple of minutes here, but today the lamb of God has felt to go up on the side of a mountain. And he takes three witnesses, Peter, James, and John. And they go up on the side of the mountain and God begins to talk with Jesus the man because now the blood of bulls and goats that session's over with. And John has declared, "Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world." Right. &gt;&gt; All of the strains of humanity, he's going to pay for &gt;&gt; he is going to buy the abstract title deed. &gt;&gt; He's going to purchase it. &gt;&gt; When the angel screams, "Who is worthy?" &gt;&gt; No man was worthy. &gt;&gt; Boaz plays the part. Joseph plays the part of our Lord going through the prison &gt;&gt; being sold for 30 pieces of silver. Jonah goes into the belly of a whale. &gt;&gt; Three days. &gt;&gt; All of them were tights. &gt;&gt; But today, here stands the man, &gt;&gt; the man Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has been tempted with everything. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every sickness, every every devil of temptation has been thrown at him. &gt;&gt; Moses stands there. &gt;&gt; I cannot even fathom the feeling of preaching to Jesus. Few weeks ago, this touched my heart. This section touched my heart so much it became unreal because it became so real to me that I am every time I walk in a pull pit I am addressing the queen of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am encouraging her. I am speaking to her in human flesh. Every prophet wanted to live here. &gt;&gt; Every one of them wanted to take the place to stand here in our places &gt;&gt; and encourage you and inspire you &gt;&gt; and take the lips words of a prophet and repeat them to you &gt;&gt; and tell you that you are the abstract title deed holders here today. It is bought and bought and paid for. &gt;&gt; And here stands Moses preaching to Jesus the man. &gt;&gt; Listen, the anointing of God is going to leave him in a few days. &gt;&gt; He's going to go through the garden of Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; He's going to be beaten. He's going to go through a trial. The people that he sent to is going to hate him. They're going to mock him. They're going to spit on him. They've got to take the word. Psalms 22 about Calvary. Isaiah 53. You were wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're counting on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if he doesn't make it through it, &gt;&gt; and Satan is going to take this vengeance out on him, &gt;&gt; are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now, I just want to bring it full circle here just for a moment. Listen, the accuser of our brethren has stood there and he's battled. He's battled Moses. &gt;&gt; He's battled Elijah. He was in the garden with Adam. He battled Joseph &gt;&gt; 19 years in a prison. He battled him &gt;&gt; and told him, "Your vision's not real. &gt;&gt; They forgot about you. &gt;&gt; He battled Jonah in a well." &gt;&gt; He battled Ezel. &gt;&gt; He battled Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; He battled Isaiah as he laid naked beside the gate. Yes, &gt;&gt; he battled all of those men of God. &gt;&gt; But today, here stands the man, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; that can pay the price. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We heard him forgive a woman &gt;&gt; the first night. &gt;&gt; He is the only one ever to have that kind of authority. &gt;&gt; Everybody else could only project &gt;&gt; to a lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But he is the man, &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah, &gt;&gt; that can look at another human being and say, "Thy sins, though they be many, &gt;&gt; thy sins, though they be many." &gt;&gt; A lot of people could say that words, but it was not revoked. &gt;&gt; Thy sins, though they be many, forgiven. &gt;&gt; Forgiven. &gt;&gt; You may be sitting here tonight and you're tarnished by every sin in the world. And Satan has did his very best because he watches you. You're born of a of a message, mom and dad. And he begins to battle you because he's had to fight your grandma and granddaddy that were believers. He's had to fight. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; And listen, he knows without the new birth, that's the best chance for him to get you. &gt;&gt; So he wars against you. He's a squatter in your humanity. &gt;&gt; He wrestles with your desires of your sexuality. He wrestles with your entertainment. He wrestles with your human ability as a sports star. He wrestles. Listen, there's women said, young girls sitting here tonight that Hollywood would love to have. &gt;&gt; You've got virtues that little girls out there marred many years ago. &gt;&gt; Some of you are model quality that could run a runway. But God who is rich in mercy, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, hallelujah, protected you from this lays and condition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When there's no more Hollywood stars, you'll be there &gt;&gt; as a daughter of God. When there's no more sports stars, you'll be there. I can hear him quote Isaiah 43. When you go through the waters, I'll be with you. When you go through the flood, I'll be with you. When you go through the fire, I'll be with you. &gt;&gt; I can hear him quote Isaiah 54, "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper." &gt;&gt; The word was preaching to the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What anchors me tonight? It's not my emotions. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not my feelings. It's what he said about me. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They quoted the scriptures. &gt;&gt; They quoted it over and over and over. They quoted it to him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said he had to look at the word to see what it said about him. &gt;&gt; You got to look at the word and see what it says about you. &gt;&gt; I heard something this morning said you got to catch it for yourself. &gt;&gt; You got to catch it for yourself. I told my boys, I told my little girl that's sitting here tonight, just because I'm a preacher, just because you've been raised in this home, you've got to know God for yourself. &gt;&gt; You've got to spend time with the voice of the prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm asked often, why don't you take your services, brother? Let me just say my voice is not real important, but his voice is of ultimate importance. God chose his voice. &gt;&gt; We spend time. Oh, but brother, I just stay home and listen to tapes. That's not what the scripture says. So much the more you see that day approaching. Assemble yourself together. &gt;&gt; Assemble together. Come to church &gt;&gt; when you don't feel like it. &gt;&gt; Gather yourselves together. Bring your licks of fire. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'm not going to go with that bunch of hypocrites. Did you stop going to Walmart? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Did you quit going to work? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The hypocrite may very well be you. Just get right with God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can imagine their energy standing here and the and the serpent's watching this scene. He's watching the scene. Wait a minute. What's Moses doing here? When he left the earth, he had a temper. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. I own his body. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute here. I have a claim on him. &gt;&gt; The man standing beside him of Elijah. Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; He was moody. &gt;&gt; He prayed to die. I've got it written right here. &gt;&gt; I got a whole Raven list on him. &gt;&gt; He acted out in his flesh. &gt;&gt; When he got under pressure, he was real moody. &gt;&gt; When he was having a bad day, &gt;&gt; look what Moses did. He struck the rock twice. &gt;&gt; I got a claim. I'm at your house and your address standing in your kitchen right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, some of you are thinking, I wish they'd had a teacher in here. Wait a minute here. These men operated in their flesh. &gt;&gt; Where's his body at? I watched him walk up on the mountain. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I watched you rapture Elijah and throw his mantel down to Elisha. Hey, but he had the same attitude. He called 42. He called he called she bears down and destroyed 42 children &gt;&gt; twice. &gt;&gt; I got some claims here. &gt;&gt; Hang with me. &gt;&gt; Hang with me. I have some claims on their body. &gt;&gt; I've got some claims. &gt;&gt; Trophies. &gt;&gt; These are trophies. &gt;&gt; Like Samson was a trophy in a mealhouse. He'd like to have you as a trophy tonight. &gt;&gt; He'd like to have you as a trophy tonight. &gt;&gt; But they were standing there taking the word. This is what you must accomplish. We're dependent on you. &gt;&gt; There's been prophets, prophets, kings, and all of those. But you're the lamb of God &gt;&gt; that takes away the sins of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He must go through the garden of &gt;&gt; Gethsemane. Listen, John knew all was lost if nobody's worthy, if nobody steps forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz all men are fallible. &gt;&gt; Ain't it amazing when you get around your friends, you just love them to death start out with, and then all of a sudden you find out they're human. You marry a woman and she's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen in your life. Give it 30 years. You marry a man and you say, "My troubles are over." And then he goes to sleep and he snores like a huskarn a chainsaw. Your children are perfect until &gt;&gt; until then they act like their mama. &gt;&gt; Little boy walks into his mama one day and forgive me. walks into his mama. I'll have you relax just a minute. Some of you want tense up on me. Little boy walks into his mama. Says, "Mama, where did we come from?" She began to tell him, "God created the heavens and the earth and he created Adam and we came from God." He walks into his daddy still asking questions, says, "Daddy, where' we come from?" Well, the way I read it, we came from monkeys. There was an evolution that took place and we came from monkeys. He walks back into mom and he says, "Mom, I'm really confused. I'm really confused. You tell me we came from God and he says we come from monkeys." She said, "Well, I was talking about my side of the family and he's talking about his side of the family." I'm sorry. Believe it or not, some of you thought that we have a perfect message. &gt;&gt; The lamb himself came to this generation. Amen. &gt;&gt; The mighty angel came down and &gt;&gt; sealed a covenant with you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gave us the unfolded word that had been sealed up for thousands of years. &gt;&gt; And God opened up his mind. Every question that in your denominational thinking, in your educational thinking, every question you could ask was answered &gt;&gt; under this open word. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we talk about living in a bride age and elected age, &gt;&gt; but we're here living in Leosa, &gt;&gt; realizing that it that that bride age simply needs a m means of maturity of his wife, &gt;&gt; the queen. &gt;&gt; And yet here we sat with the struggle and the dispute for our body. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham kind of simply answered this whole thing in the greatest battle that's ever fought. If you missed Brother Tim's teaching the other morning, it answered incredible questions, I'm sure, in many of your minds to understand that your DNA and your father's problems pass right down into your flesh. &gt;&gt; And Satan is a as a squatter, he believes that he legally owns your body. and he will wrestle in your mind because that's his right to do &gt;&gt; because he and God made a decision where we're going to war at &gt;&gt; and they decided to do it in your mind. &gt;&gt; This is the word the war takes place. But simply put, here you are bombarded in Leosa, which the scripture says is rich. They believe they're rich. They're increased with goods and they have need of nothing. You don't live in an age of martyrdom to where that there's just very few Christians. But you live in an age where everybody's born again. &gt;&gt; You live in an age where there's churches on every corner. &gt;&gt; You live in an age to where there's people that look a whole lot like you in a lot of respects. &gt;&gt; And they say, "We're religious as well. &gt;&gt; We go to church." &gt;&gt; And before long, they're intermingling. And before long, their perverted births and their perverted doctrines and their perverted religions, if we're not careful, begins to influence our lives. &gt;&gt; Before long, we we bring in easy belieism and we believe, you know, as parents, we don't want to make it so hard on our children. We want them to have a good bed and we want them to have good tennis shoes and we want them to have good pants and even if they do tear holes in them and we want them to have good clothes. We want them to have good jobs. And when they come to church, we feel like that, you know, don't be so tough on them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Don't be legalistic with them. You know, just kind of ease up. You know, it's a new day. &gt;&gt; And before long, if we're not careful, &gt;&gt; we're substituting the new birth &gt;&gt; for saying God sent a prophet &gt;&gt; for believing the message and putting doctrines in the right orders. And and before long, we're just coming sitting in a pew. If we pay our ti, we're good. You know, if we show up once a month, we're good. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're no longer in brush harbors now. Now we got fine buildings. And we've all got fine buildings now. But we've got fine buildings. We've got we've got easier seats to set on. Now we've got choirs. Brother Brandham said, now we've got great musicians. We got good song leaders. And sometimes we've got good preachers. So happen not tonight. But we've got good preachers, anointed men of God to take the word. And if we're not careful, we'll allow it to become common to us. &gt;&gt; We'll sit in the pew and nod our head or we'll we'll let somebody else do our worshiping for us. &gt;&gt; Because there is a dispute over our body. &gt;&gt; This piece of clay that we're wrestling with. We'll forget our children are eagles. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be a whole lot longer, but you just hang right with me. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; We'll forget our children are eagles like we're eagles. &gt;&gt; And you can't break the egg for them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; You cannot break the egg for them. They are born eagles. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But they are going to have to fight their way out of the egg. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You just can't peck a hole and say, "Here, come here, baby. Come here, baby." You can't learn them the way. You can't give them a learned behavior. &gt;&gt; They're predestinated eagles. &gt;&gt; They're born eagles. They're not born chickens and buzzers and crows. &gt;&gt; We're different from our birth. &gt;&gt; God watched over us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're sitting here tonight and say, "Well, Brother Ron, God ain't never did nothing for me." God watched over your natural state &gt;&gt; all the way since Adam through wars, through plagues, through turmals, through earthquakes, natural disasters. And every time seeds came forth, that predestinated seed came carrying in your body. &gt;&gt; God took a picture of you before the foundation of the world. He knew how tall you'd be, how ugly you'd be, what color eyes you'd have. &gt;&gt; He knew the strains that you would wrestle with. &gt;&gt; He knew the nervousness that you would wrestle with. He knew the complexes you'd wrestle with. He knew the sins of the fathers would be passed down to you. But he put something on the inside of you. He put something in there that would give you overcoming power. &gt;&gt; Once it is ignited, &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah. Once ignited, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm doing my best to behave. &gt;&gt; But you see, Satan don't have a long to work. And let me just let me just use a term he used this morning. Digress. I think it means to go backwards. Satan watched your fathers and mothers. And some of us don't have a real popular family tree. you go far back in it, you know, automatically say, "Uhuh, I don't want to go no further. My uncle's not Winston Churchill." Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's not the King of England. Wait a minute. It's a I I don't believe I want to go back anymore. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I was born of Charles and Ella Brandom. &gt;&gt; That's my earthly mother and father." Right? He said, "I'm not so proud of my family tree, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But I am of my heavenly father, &gt;&gt; I have a good mom and daddy and a good dad-in-law and good mother-in-law and I had a good great granddaddy and all down through the age. I was very fortunate. But they yet poured down into my flesh &gt;&gt; some strains of temper and stubbornness. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? the things that you struggle with. &gt;&gt; And Satan looks at you and he says, "I have a claim. &gt;&gt; I have a claim." He hears you &gt;&gt; when you're home fussing. &gt;&gt; He hears you when you're quarreling. &gt;&gt; You can sit on these pews and listen, there's sometimes you have to struggle your way to raise your hand and praise the Lord. You have to struggle to say amen. &gt;&gt; But you know if you've got the Holy Ghost, you'll say amen to every word of God. &gt;&gt; And you know that word is true. &gt;&gt; You know that word is delivering you. &gt;&gt; And so you echo a response to God. &gt;&gt; You come to wash his feet. You come to bring him a fresh drink. But Satan will bombard you with commonness and and familiarity and knowing one another. &gt;&gt; He'll bombard you &gt;&gt; with looking way off yonder somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Grass is always greener on the other side. That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll bombard you with job offers, &gt;&gt; trying to get you out of church, &gt;&gt; friends, and pull you this way and more entertaining situations on Sunday and Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; And before long, you come up missing &gt;&gt; and before long, you're backsliding. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Backsliding is not sitting in a bar somewhere or another, &gt;&gt; not at some scene somewhere or another, but you can sit right there and backslide. &gt;&gt; When you refuse to go any further with God &gt;&gt; when you become satisfied, I've got enough. &gt;&gt; People never better move up with me. That's a good stage of backsliding. We live in an age that's very convenient. Our internet is great. I mean, we're thrilled about it, but it's also one of the most destructive things that we can have. &gt;&gt; We can get up and say good morning to the whole world. &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready to take a shower. I have a flat tire. I'm late for my doctor's appointment. &gt;&gt; I'm going to church. &gt;&gt; We can watch our favorite preacher no matter where he's at. If we're not careful, &gt;&gt; we'll create a profile &gt;&gt; and the enemy will get right in and we'll begin to chat with people from yester year. &gt;&gt; They'll begin to remind us of things that if we're not careful, our flesh begins to be pulled towards. &gt;&gt; And we'll dig up bones that should not have been dug up. Are you with me? I'm just &gt;&gt; I got a good list here. You just hang right with me. &gt;&gt; If it we aren't careful. &gt;&gt; We lose our edge going to church. &gt;&gt; We lose our stimulation. &gt;&gt; We forget that we were oracles to built to worship God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We were built to have a prayer meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. to enter into the shakana glory of God. &gt;&gt; And before long, we're just busy. &gt;&gt; Before long, 24 hours slips away from us. &gt;&gt; Before long, we're prosperous in our jobs. &gt;&gt; And we can make our own way. &gt;&gt; We didn't get a position at church to preach. So now we've got one created women preachers. Before long, we're putting pictures on the internet that of sacred moments. &gt;&gt; Before long, the enemy leads us to the wrong sites. &gt;&gt; And I stand here, I'm ignorant. I wouldn't know how to go the wrong sites to be honest with you. Some of you are going to laugh at this next statement. I've never been to YouTube. I've never been to TV on the internet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I I I don't know anything. I couldn't take you to Facebook. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; My wife has a site, but I couldn't get you there. &gt;&gt; I'm just thankful I can read Brother Brown's message and and study the message on the computer. &gt;&gt; I'm a redneck, and I'm not afra I'm not ashamed to say that. But I thank God I was a sinner, but I've been saved by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; I've just become accompanied with texting. &gt;&gt; I can now text and get thumbs to work. I'm thrilled about that. I can say hello and and K. I wouldn't know how to send you a picture if my life depended on it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Thank you for that last picture, Brother John. But if we're not careful, Satan will begin to bombard our mind. &gt;&gt; He'll bombard our mind with information. &gt;&gt; And we'll start creating pages that we would like to delete but never can delete. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I hit the delete button. It's always there. &gt;&gt; It's not like the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ. Listen, when you repent of your sins and you ask God to forgive you of your sins and the abstract title deed is cleared by the blood of Jesus Christ, Brother Brown said it is bleach. And when your sins go down in there, &gt;&gt; our all knowing God, &gt;&gt; the God that knows how many hairs has been on every head since Adam. The God that knows how many bats there's ever been, how many ants there's ever been, how many mosquitoes there's ever been. &gt;&gt; That's got to be a great God. &gt;&gt; The God that knows the end from the beginning. &gt;&gt; When you ask him for mercy, &gt;&gt; when you ask him for forgiveness, &gt;&gt; he puts it in the delete file. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And let me just say this to you. Not even God can find it. Not even God can find me, &gt;&gt; brother. But I was this and I was that. I'm ashamed to tell you the other night, I was a drug addict. There's things I've never repeated across my lips I didn't want my children to know. I didn't want my church to know. But when I went on my knees and I said, "God, I need you to forgive me of this. I'm sorry. My sins went against the blood of Jesus Christ. I apologize. I want you to have dominion over my life. Forgive me for my weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm not a Catholic. I don't have to do purgatory every day. I don't have to count rosary beads. I don't have to kiss dead statues. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. My God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Luther preached justification. But under the opening of the word, brother said, "You never did it in the first place." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I had a man come to me one time and tell told me, he said, "You're not qualified to preach. You're not qualified to preach." Okay. With your past, you're not qualified to preach. All right? Here was my answer. Paul was a murderer. &gt;&gt; Paul was a blasphemer. &gt;&gt; Said every day Paul say stall Stephen &gt;&gt; and held his coat. Every day &gt;&gt; he lived with the scars. Right? &gt;&gt; We may have to live with some scars in our life, &gt;&gt; but it's God &gt;&gt; who qualifies. &gt;&gt; I'm not so impressed with your qualifications. You didn't put me in. You can't take me out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I was walking to the altar in a little old country church, I didn't look around and say, "Am I qualified to walk to this altar?" &gt;&gt; I didn't lay down rosary beads on the way up there. &gt;&gt; I simply went before God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I simply went before God. Don't get cold on me now. And I ain't talking about the temperature &gt;&gt; because let me just say this to you. All of us were guilty. &gt;&gt; All of us were guilty. &gt;&gt; Can I say it again? All of us were guilty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's none righteous. No, not one. &gt;&gt; Where you going with this? Just hang on to your socks a minute. &gt;&gt; All of us were guilty. As a matter of fact, our thoughts today would send us to hell. &gt;&gt; Some of your thoughts right here in the last few minutes will send you to hell. &gt;&gt; I needed an abstract. I can look 2,000 years ago and if I could say it, I'd say, "Preach Moses. &gt;&gt; I need him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Preach Elijah. &gt;&gt; I need him. &gt;&gt; Cuz no mortal has any right to stand in the presence of God and condemn another mortal. &gt;&gt; No mortal. True. &gt;&gt; No mortal. &gt;&gt; So that qualifies about every one of us. Nobody has any stones that they can throw. &gt;&gt; Nobody. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, you're getting at me." Yes, sir. I'm getting at every one of us. We don't want to leave one huff here. &gt;&gt; We don't want to leave one of you here. &gt;&gt; You must remember, we're not enemies. We're a family. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll finish that part in the morning. But let me just say this to you. As the queen of heaven, we're going to judge the earth. &gt;&gt; We're going to get in practice right here. Forgiving one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. man called me one day and he said that woman is not even qualified to sit in a church. I asked him the question, did you ever kiss another woman before you got married? Before an all- knowing God and the failure of your mistake. Yes. Yes, I did. I'm sorry. Say it louder. Yes, I did. I'm sorry. You're a minister. You kissed another man's wife. &gt;&gt; You need mercy. And I took him to what I preached to you Thursday night. There was a woman who had received multitudes of perverted seeds. I took my glasses off so I can't see you. So here we are. She had received multitudes of seeds, but she had something lacking in her life. &gt;&gt; She needed Jesus. &gt;&gt; If we're not careful, we'll set on message pews. &gt;&gt; We'll live in message homes. But if we're not careful, the God of this Bible that we've been talking about this week will not live in our lives. &gt;&gt; And it's more than a book. &gt;&gt; It's more than a picture. &gt;&gt; This is a life. &gt;&gt; My children needed mercy. &gt;&gt; Your children needs mercy. &gt;&gt; Yes. If you can't forgive sins, neither can your sins be forgiven. &gt;&gt; And every one of us here tonight have weaknesses. But Paul said, "I seek to know nothing among you, save Jesus Christ only." &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, let me preach just a few more minutes. If we're not careful, lay out ought to see an age. &gt;&gt; One that over gets overlooked because of people feel like the delay of the coming, &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord lifting things becoming cooler will start biting and devouring one another. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And you, just as much as you've got to resist Hollywood and internet and pornographic sites, you have to resist your own flesh. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's an anointing on this age. &gt;&gt; Let me preach to you. There's an anointing on this age to murder one another. &gt;&gt; And I'm not talking about AK-47s and 9 mm. I'm talking about the most deadly weapon every one of us got. And that's our tongue. &gt;&gt; Brother Harold Yilderbrand said, "Sometimes we just need to stop and take a drink of water." Yes, sir. Some of us need to drink a gallon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; $5. &gt;&gt; I am what I am. &gt;&gt; God help me. If we're not careful, our teenagers lives will be shattered. &gt;&gt; Before long, therefore long, the sanctuary of the home has been a place where we gossip. &gt;&gt; It's a place that the tape recorder is not played anymore. The iPod's not played anymore. &gt;&gt; We're not as urgent about going to church. We're not pulling on the gift of God that God put as Christ as an angel of the Lord before us. &gt;&gt; If we're not careful, we miss our worship service and we walk in after it's all over with and because it's not our favorite singers or maybe they're singing songs that we really don't want like and we just sit there and our hands held down. I don't I'm just preaching. &gt;&gt; And you know, songs are testimonies whether we feel like it or not. They're testimonies of victory and testimonies of praise and &gt;&gt; testimonies of joy. &gt;&gt; They're testimonies of healing. &gt;&gt; They're testimonies of the power of the redemption of the blood. &gt;&gt; They're testimonies of of when we're going through dark times and we come and we sing those songs. We welcome the spirit of God into this place &gt;&gt; and we're driving back the devils that have got a hold of us and we fought all week long and we finally get into church and we start entering in and the preacher who's been isolated from the world is inspired by God to go to a certain passage and he reads the word and if you're in tune and you've been in that inner veil automatically you're with him &gt;&gt; because not only is that preacher He's just like you. He's struggling with his own body. &gt;&gt; He's struggling with his own humanity. But we've got a promise. &gt;&gt; They which are alive and remain shall be caught up. &gt;&gt; Our accuser who's holding our body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The jurisdiction of sin has been revoked. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's clean. &gt;&gt; It's not about what you think. It's not about what you remember. &gt;&gt; But there's a seed of God that has been ignited in there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Unbelief and doubt does not hinder my God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You battle the ought to see. &gt;&gt; Listen, this may be the last time I get to preach to you ever in my life. And I'm going to give it every bit of energy I can give it. &gt;&gt; Satan is battling, but he don't have much longer to work. You know, it disappointed him &gt;&gt; when he argued with the death angel &gt;&gt; in a glass room two and a half years ago. &gt;&gt; He's got so many failures, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He ain't done whipping you yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can hear the angel Lord. Oh no, we ain't done yet here, boy. &gt;&gt; Oh no, it ain't time for him to go in a grave yet. Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; This one ain't designed to go to death. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My body wasn't designed to be put sixt under. My body was designed to be changed in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; Somewhere between 6:00 and 9:00. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My eyes are going to see my grandma. They're going to see my loved ones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm like Job. I know my redeemer love. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; While I'm standing here tonight, let me just say this to you. Those that are planning on staying here through the tribulation period, you better hang on to every one of these services &gt;&gt; cuz we're getting right close to the end. There's foolish virgins sitting right among us and they're too busy to come to church. They're too busy to worship the Lord. They're too busy to pay their ties. &gt;&gt; But something about you and I leaving here, &gt;&gt; something about Los Angeles dropping beneath the ocean. &gt;&gt; Something about a Superman of the Pope &gt;&gt; and a whole one world government. &gt;&gt; And something about being hunted down like dogs. A job no longer is important. Sports is no longer important. Television, all the junk of the world is no longer important. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. They're willing now to give their life for the gospel. &gt;&gt; Cuz God's under obligation to 144,000 Jews just as much as he's under obligation to me and you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll finish that part of the sermon tomorrow morning. But let me just say this to you. We will &gt;&gt; It will not be a maybe, &gt;&gt; but we will overcome. I've seen on the inside of a file leaf of a Bible written about the boy from Finley. And he tells the vision for a couple of years. I've seen it. I've seen it with my own eyes. A vision about a 42 inch caribou. You were there to see it. a silver tipped grizzly bear and you were there to see it. &gt;&gt; But also the same prophet said she'll be bone of his bone, &gt;&gt; life of his life, &gt;&gt; power of his power. &gt;&gt; She's a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; She's a bride that will not fail. &gt;&gt; You've got an anchor. &gt;&gt; You got an anchor that'll hold you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got an anchor. &gt;&gt; God had confidence that you'd go through your sicknesses and your trials. You'll make it. &gt;&gt; He put something on the inside of you. You'll make it. &gt;&gt; You'll make it. &gt;&gt; You'll make it. &gt;&gt; You're going to make it. &gt;&gt; When you feel like quitting, let me just say there's an anchor down in there. &gt;&gt; You're going to make it. &gt;&gt; Brother Ken, there's been a lot of criticism your way many days. No doubt you got discouraged, but you're going to make it. &gt;&gt; We got a covenant. &gt;&gt; No weapon that is formed against us shall prosper. &gt;&gt; No. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm done. I just want to share something with you. &gt;&gt; You may be struggling tonight and you have came to this meeting knowing because you know yourself. I've never did this before in my life, but I'm going to do this tonight. So, I feel led of God to do it. &gt;&gt; Don't get scared. &gt;&gt; Amen. But listen, we've already had a lamb &gt;&gt; that loosed us. &gt;&gt; We've already had a lamb that became our king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's our bridegroom group. &gt;&gt; He's already loosed the chains. &gt;&gt; We've been told who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got a new identification. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this tonight. You don't have to leave this meeting &gt;&gt; with chains. hanging on you. &gt;&gt; Habits that you know are very private that is destroying your life. And every time you get down to pray, he reminds you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every time you get so close to God, he reminds you. You remember when &gt;&gt; and then you know he knows. You know he knows. You know that night that you put pushed on the wrong button and sent you to the wrong sight. You know when your tongue got cut loose at the wrong time. &gt;&gt; And every time you think you're getting victory, your accuser &gt;&gt; reminds you. &gt;&gt; If you don't hear anything else tonight, listen to this. He is stripped of every bit of his power. He don't have the keys to his own house. &gt;&gt; He has a blow and he has no arrows. &gt;&gt; He is a liar. &gt;&gt; You can put those weaknesses at Jesus' feet right here tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You, not your mom and your daddy, not your neighbor, not your preacher. &gt;&gt; You. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz when the lights go out, you know, &gt;&gt; but he said, "I'll give you a peace that passes all understanding." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then you can love your enemies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can love your enemies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Could we just bow our heads just for a moment? Could we just be honest tonight? Could we just say, "Brother Ron, I personally needed this word tonight to deliver me. I needed this tonight to deliver me. I needed this. I needed this. Young, old, everyone sitting in this building. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Samson realized a prayer meeting. A prayer meeting would restore his strength. &gt;&gt; I can't restore it, but I know one that can. &gt;&gt; Standing somewhere in the shadows, you'll find Jesus. He's a friend who always cares and understands. Hallelujah. Pass me an auto general savior, brother Ryan. I want to invite you to where I'm standing at just now. Not to an altar. You raised your hands. I want to invite you. It's an odd place for the wrong cuz I like you need an altar. I like you need an altar. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Those that raise your hands, could you just stand to your feet just now? Could you just make your way this way? Step out. Leave pride where it's at. Whoever you are, your name, I don't care if you're preacher's son, preacher's daughter, my children, I want to just make a circle right here. Hallelujah. The scripture said, "Whom the Son is set free is free indeed." When God looks at our our title D, what was there and we ask him to forgive us? There's something about his blood. &gt;&gt; Brother Derek, he just wipes it wide away. And the greatest enemy God's got, the most intelligent mind that's ever been on the face of this earth, can stand there and all he sees is an empty page. Because God's blood takes our lust, takes our temper, &gt;&gt; takes our unruly tongue, takes our eyes that looks at things that they shouldn't see, takes our mind that roves and thinks negative thoughts. Hallelujah. And he cleans us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And you don't have to be a slave to it no longer. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; there's just something about the human ability to bow their head before God. &gt;&gt; You're not a God that's dull of hearing. &gt;&gt; You're a God that hears our whispers. And there's something about breath going across vocal cords, &gt;&gt; going over a tongue and through lips &gt;&gt; when they're talking to their Lord that they didn't have to have a private interview because we could come boldly before the throne of grace. Oh, God of glory. There was a time we had to have blood of bulls and goats and turtle ducks. But our kinsmen &gt;&gt; saw the condition we'd be in tonight. There's a dispute over my human body. Oh, dear God, tonight in your plans to have a rapture, &gt;&gt; Satan disputes, brings up all of our iniquities and our tr our trespasses. All of our faults and failures, and reminds us daily of what we've did. But we remind him tonight, he's a liar. &gt;&gt; We repent before you, God. We're sorry. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We individually, &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask you to forgive us for what we've done. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; God, I ask you to forgive you. I'm I'm I'm sorry that I've did you wrong. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I've been negative. I'm sorry my attitude's been stinking. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us tonight, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, you see those that's been on the wrong kind of internet. You see those that have did immoral sins. You see the things of people's lives. You see where we failed to worship you. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, come tonight. Meet us right here in this camp right now. &gt;&gt; Lord, the things that we wrestle with, Father. Lord, we're not willing to leave this building tonight until you come. &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask you to come to every young man, every young girl, every every every elderly man, every old little girl. Lord, tonight I pray that you we have a prayer meeting to shake the shingles off of a roof. Lord, come and meet our needs tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, you see the feebleness of our humanity. Oh God, you see our first book that was written, Lord, I pray tonight that you would help us, dear God. &gt;&gt; Lord, come tonight, Lord Jesus. Oh Lord Jesus. Lord, touch every one of them tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Won't you just call out on him just now? &gt;&gt; Invite him to where you're standing at right now. &gt;&gt; Lord, you've invited me. I'm here, &gt;&gt; Lord. Come. I'm You're welcome here right now, &gt;&gt; Lord. Come to my body, Lord. &gt;&gt; Come live here, &gt;&gt; Lord. I want you to be a temple of the Holy Ghost inside of me, Lord. &gt;&gt; For your glory. &gt;&gt; For your glory. &gt;&gt; Help me to have a better prayer life, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help my passion, Father. &gt;&gt; Help me to be more urgent than ever before. &gt;&gt; Help me every time. Lord God, &gt;&gt; come minister to me tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Lord, shake every chain away, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Take every depression devil. &gt;&gt; Every nervous devil, &gt;&gt; every sickness, devil, Hallelujah. Death has no dominion over top of us. &gt;&gt; Sickness has no dominion over top of us. &gt;&gt; Cancer is not bigger than my God. &gt;&gt; Tuberculosis is not bigger than my God. &gt;&gt; Lust is not bigger than my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hollywood is not bigger than my God tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh God, tonight. &gt;&gt; Set us free tonight by the power of your word. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Won't you just &gt;&gt; welcome him right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus.

Don't you love lingering in his presence? &gt;&gt; I just wonder tonight if you can stand in this kind of atmosphere and hear this kind of word that you ministered tonight and want to live in the state that you're living in. May God arrest your soul. &gt;&gt; But I believe we've heard a word tonight that has reached down into the heart of men and women &gt;&gt; that want to know him in the power of his resurrection. And they can say tonight by the grace of God, I came to church expecting and God met my expectation. The word met my expectation. God sent a man. But it was the word that spoke to my soul. It was the word I responded to. And I am so thankful I am with the people that are in this little tent that are pulling on the presence of God right now. I don't believe God's finished dealing with lives. &gt;&gt; You might feel that maybe you want to go home this evening and you need to go to your cabin and you need to have a rest. You're invited to go. We're going to have a wonderful service tomorrow. But those that are the campers and counselors, you want to linger and you want to stay in the presence of God, then you stay. We're dismissing you in the name of Jesus Christ. You have to make your way home and travel back in the morning. Then I say, God bless you for coming. If you just kindly just make your way off the grounds, that would be wonderful. But you want to stay and worship God and look to the lamb of God and stay in his presence and linger a little while, you go right ahead. That's why we're having this camp meeting. Lord, I believe you're dealing very deeply, sovereignly, individually in the hearts of our precious, precious young people. &gt;&gt; Lord, over the past weeks and months, we've set some time aside. We have prayed much and we have so desired for a time such as this. Precious sisters have closed their closet doors and brothers have shut themselves away for such a time as this. And so Lord, our prayers have not been in vain. But you're a God that hears and you're a God that answers. &gt;&gt; And we want to thank you this evening, Lord. for the sovereignty of your spirit &gt;&gt; by the power of your word that delivers and sets a people free. &gt;&gt; I'm asking Lord that you'll watch over your children as they will journey and travel on the road. May traveling mercies be with them. And Father, at our appointed time tomorrow morning, if you should give us that time at 10:00, &gt;&gt; we'll come back and meet with you again. &gt;&gt; So, Father, I'm asking now you go with your children and may they go in the peace and love of Christ in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. Until we meet again tomorrow morning at 10:00, God be with you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. So I'm casting all my cares. So I'm casting all my cares on you. I know.
