[11:41] could I ask you to please come open the
[11:42] service for us in a word of prayer? We
[11:45] don't have any written prayer requests.
[11:48] I just have this chorus growing through
[11:50] my heart. Mercy rewrote my life. If we
[11:53] could just sing this as our brother Ken
[11:54] comes. I should have fallen, my soul
[11:56] cast down, but thank God for his mercy.
[11:59] Amen. And let's just show our
[12:00] appreciation to the Lord this morning as
[12:02] we sing this and our brother Ken comes
[12:04] to lead us before the throne of grace
[12:05] this morning.
[12:08] Mercy
[12:11] roll my life.
[12:15] I'm glad that he mercy
[12:20] re
[12:23] [Music]
[12:26] when I should have fallen in my soul.

[12:41] Aren't you so thankful? Let's just
[12:43] worship him. Oh, his mercy. His mercy.
[12:55] His mercy.
[12:58] [Music]
[13:05] I should have fallen in. My soul
[13:11] has now
[13:15] mercy.
[13:17] [Music]
[13:22] Hallelujah. Amen.
[13:25] Thank you.
[13:28] Let us bow our heads.
[13:30] our loving Lord Jesus Christ.
[13:34] It's an honor to be in your presence.
[13:39] Thank you, Lord, for your promises
[13:42] to be with us and around this globe,
[13:46] worldwide,
[13:48] every 24 hours as it swirls around. You
[13:52] are watching over the individual elect
[13:54] persons of your being. Your sons and
[13:57] daughters that you've had in your mind
[14:00] before the foundation of the world. We
[14:03] are a portion of your family. Lord, as
[14:06] you look upon us today, your children
[14:09] here are under expectation.
[14:12] Believing all of your word. Oh Lord God,
[14:16] we thank you that you've spoken in this
[14:19] end time,
[14:21] this latter time, the end of the world.
[14:24] You have come forth speaking again,
[14:27] raising up a prophet that you can
[14:30] control and speak through and give us
[14:32] the final word for this season. Lord, we
[14:37] trust that we will be filled with your
[14:39] spirit today, recipients of that word,
[14:42] progressing on and on, finishing the
[14:45] work that you have ordained, that you
[14:48] would accomplish in this hour. Lord, as
[14:51] you look upon us this morning,
[14:54] we are not here by chance. You have
[14:56] elected and designed that we would be
[14:58] here. You've draw us here. You've
[15:01] positioned us here as individuals. We're
[15:04] thankful Lord for this assembly, brother
[15:07] Biscll that you led to be in this area
[15:10] and you foreseen all these things.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Time is just something you use to bring
[15:18] forth your glory in the lives of your
[15:22] people. Now Lord, today as we are
[15:26] trusting in you and believing your
[15:27] promises, each individual life is
[15:31] looking for a furtherance a closer
[15:34] relationship with you, Lord. And we pray
[15:37] that that will be granted. We know you
[15:39] will. Grant us the faith and take away
[15:42] all unbelief. Sweep in upon this
[15:45] congregation, Lord, and the congregation
[15:48] by the internet. And we pray that all
[15:50] unbelief would be swept away and we
[15:54] would have full access to your throne
[15:56] today. In Jesus Christ's name, we ask
[15:59] these blessings that you will keep your
[16:02] word, raise up the sick, raise up the
[16:05] dead, heal the sick, forgive the sinner,
[16:08] bring back those that have transgressed
[16:10] and left you. You have not promised to
[16:13] bring those that are backsliden back to
[16:16] you. But we pray for them. If they're
[16:19] savable, Lord God, we know that you are
[16:23] available for them to accept. In Jesus
[16:27] name, we commit ourselves to you for
[16:30] your glory. Amen.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, saints. As you have
[16:37] your seats, sing that chorus. So glad
[16:40] I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. E
[16:42] flat.

[17:16] "So,
[17:21] so
[17:23] I
[17:27] [Music]
[17:35] let your mercy
[17:41] Oh,
[17:44] so you found me
[17:49] and
[17:54] so
[17:56] [Music]
[18:03] Amen. We're going to sing that chorus
[18:05] another time or two. Just going to
[18:06] invite the Biscal sisters to come and
[18:08] sing for us this morning. And before we
[18:10] turn the pulpit to our pastor, maybe
[18:13] sisters, if you'd like to get ready at
[18:14] this time and also any who are visiting
[18:16] with us, we just want to extend a warm
[18:18] welcome to you this morning. It's nice
[18:19] to see those who come and spend time
[18:21] with us. We appreciate you. And everyone
[18:23] that's gathered this morning or under
[18:24] the sound of our voice, we just want to
[18:25] say God bless you and may God meet you
[18:27] where you are and in your need. Amen.

[18:32] Maryland, come now. So glad I'm yours.

[19:04] So I yours, Lord.
[19:09] So I am yours.
[19:36] [Music]
[19:41] I hear the echo
[19:47] of a heavenly symphony.
[19:52] [Music]
[19:53] A great and wonderous
[19:58] word is playing on
[20:04] with his rhythm of heavenly light. I
[20:10] close my eyes to earthly sight.
[20:15] And in his music
[20:18] [Music]
[20:19] I see Christ.
[20:25] The word so pure
[20:29] is like a symphony.
[20:35] Through ages past,
[20:39] each saint has heard it me.
[20:45] It speaks to today.
[20:49] The promise
[20:52] now fulfilled
[20:56] and I'm caught up within its message.
[21:03] Born to be a part,
[21:08] born to be inspired,
[21:12] listening for the changes
[21:15] in God's
[21:17] symphony.
[21:19] [Music]
[21:22] I hear the echo
[21:27] of a heavenly symphony.
[21:30] [Music]
[21:33] Only the bride
[21:36] can understand what's playing.
[21:43] Christ the composer and bride will be
[21:49] all in one spirit. Sweet harmony.
[21:54] Oh hallelu
[21:58] praise our God.
[22:04] The words so pure
[22:07] is like a symphony.
[22:14] Through ages past,
[22:17] each saint has heard it me.
[22:24] It speaks to today.
[22:28] The promise
[22:31] now fulfilled
[22:35] and I'm caught up within it message.
[22:41] Born to be aart.
[22:45] [Music]
[22:46] Worn to be inspired.
[22:50] Listening for the changes
[22:54] in God's

[23:55] Praise the Lord. Aren't you thankful for
[23:57] the Holy Spirit keeping us all in tune
[24:00] as one one great symphony as our brother
[24:02] John spoke recently. Amen. Let's turn
[24:05] the pulpit to our pastor now as our
[24:07] brother Ed comes. Let's just sing that
[24:09] old hymn. Blessed assurance, Jesus is
[24:11] mine. Oh, what a foretaste. Many times
[24:14] we just sing over these lyrics without
[24:16] actually thinking about them. I want you
[24:18] to think about these lyrics when you
[24:20] sing air of salvation purchased of God.
[24:23] Amen. Saints, let's claim our
[24:24] inheritance this morning and ask the
[24:26] Lord to speak to us where we are and
[24:28] know that it'll be a different service
[24:29] this morning. Are you ready for the
[24:30] word? Amen. Let's sing this as we invite
[24:33] our pastor to come. Oh blessed assure
[24:40] Jesus is

[24:48] tastes.

[25:05] born of his
[25:10] washing.
[25:12] And this is my story. This is my story.
[25:18] Yes, this is my song.

[27:10] was
[27:15] I Myior
[27:17] [Music]
[27:28] [Music]
[27:35] [Music]
[27:42] is my story.
[27:46] This is my song.
[27:50] I'm praising my Sior
[27:54] [Music]
[27:56] all.
[28:00] This is my story.
[28:04] This is my song.
[28:09] Praising my Savior.
[28:13] Oh, one more time. This is my story. Oh,
[28:18] this is my story.
[28:22] This is my song.
[28:27] Praising my sior.
[28:32] [Music]
[28:36] This is my story.
[28:40] This is my song.
[28:45] Praising God.
[28:48] [Music]
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; We say God bless you.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; That's the best thing we can say.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful that you are here
[29:04] this morning. And Lord willing, I'm
[29:07] going to be speaking.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:12] Uh
[29:13] I the deacons have some pads and in case
[29:18] you don't have a slip of paper that
[29:20] you'd like to make a note on because I
[29:23] have quite a number of references and it
[29:26] would be good for you to jot those down
[29:30] so you can go back to it. I do that
[29:33] frequently. You may wonder what we're
[29:36] writing. Brother Tom was preaching in
[29:39] the last several services and in the
[29:42] last service he actually made a summary
[29:45] but maybe you weren't getting it. uh you
[29:49] would have to have attended the other
[29:51] services but uh on the first service he
[29:55] spoke on and the reason I'm mentioning
[29:58] that is because it will tie into in a
[30:02] way it will tie into uh what I have to
[30:05] say to you today
[30:07] but he spoke on hear him
[30:11] and that was that was the important
[30:16] uh determin ation within our hearts to
[30:20] hear him. Not hear just a local vocal
[30:25] voice
[30:27] uh but to hear him. Uh that's the key of
[30:33] of the message. And then in the second
[30:36] service he spoke on uh how God gives the
[30:41] ability or ears to hear
[30:44] &gt;&gt; right
[30:44] &gt;&gt; and to understand. And Jesus said,
[30:48] "Blessed are your ears, for they hear,
[30:51] and for your eyes which they see." So
[30:56] he's making a distinction.
[30:59] Some see, some don't see. Some hear,
[31:02] some don't hear. And then uh the last
[31:06] service, God has a purpose. And I
[31:11] thought that was very, very important.
[31:13] God has a purpose in saying it. And then
[31:18] we that are given ears to hear, we hear
[31:21] it and eyes to see and we say it and
[31:26] then we become instruments in the hand
[31:29] of God to fulfill his purpose.
[31:32] &gt;&gt; And that's that was the reason he spoke
[31:34] in the first place. So I thought that
[31:36] was really wonderful and uh thank you
[31:39] brother Tom for those services. Uh, and
[31:43] this evening, Brother Tim Dodd will take
[31:47] the pulpit and uh, put the icing on the
[31:51] cake. I hope
[31:54] if there's any cake to put icing on.
[31:57] Anyway,
[31:59] so I'm glad to be here and to be able to
[32:02] spend this time with you. I want to
[32:04] speak this morning on a subject that uh
[32:11] is very different really and yet it's
[32:14] very very
[32:16] uh you're very accustomed to it. You've
[32:18] heard it many times and the word is
[32:21] predestination.
[32:23] Say, "Oh, I believe that." Well, I'm
[32:26] glad you do. But now we're going to find
[32:29] out what it really is. And I think it'll
[32:32] be a bit of a surprise to you. It was to
[32:35] me.
[32:37] It'll be a surprise to you
[32:40] to know how it was approached
[32:44] by the messenger. How he approached it
[32:47] and why he approached it. It's all in
[32:50] God's great plan.
[32:53] Do you know that predestination happens
[32:55] to be one of the major major
[32:59] uh doctrines that goes in two different
[33:03] directions
[33:05] &gt;&gt; and one doesn't want to believe it
[33:07] &gt;&gt; in the sovereignty of God. Uh and it's
[33:11] called Calvin. I'm going to show it to
[33:14] you on the screen because I want you to
[33:16] be able to read it yourself and and
[33:20] understand what this is. And if you have
[33:22] some questions about it, which you
[33:24] probably will have or should have, jot
[33:28] the question down and uh either
[33:32] some God will raise up a ministry and
[33:35] he'll touch on it or the Holy Spirit
[33:38] will reveal it to you in as you walk in
[33:42] your life and uh he'll make it known to
[33:45] you and that's wonderful.
[33:48] Uh so
[33:52] in speaking on uh predestination and
[33:56] you'll understand a lot more about it by
[33:58] the time we're we're through this
[34:01] morning. Um
[34:04] as I said it was a two major thoughts.
[34:08] One is, you know, you make your own
[34:10] choice
[34:12] and God's grace allows you just to make
[34:15] your own decisions.
[34:18] And I want to explain that I I look upon
[34:22] predestination as as a broad subject out
[34:25] here. And God has sovereignly
[34:29] done things and right away, you know, in
[34:32] a human the human mind is they don't
[34:35] want to be told what to do. Well, I just
[34:37] want to introduce some couple things to
[34:40] you. You a lot of you are married. A lot
[34:43] of you have children, your fathers, your
[34:45] mothers, etc., etc. Let me tell you,
[34:48] talk to you as parents. Uh we are
[34:51] parents. I and my wife. My wife is here
[34:55] today and we're happy that uh the
[34:58] devil's been defeated and the pneumonia
[35:00] has gone and she feels up to being here.
[35:04] So, I'm glad she's here. But we have a a
[35:07] a large family thanks to our three
[35:10] daughters. And there we none of us had a
[35:13] whole bunch of kids at once. But uh
[35:17] three plus three plus, you know, plus
[35:19] nine plus a few more. And anyway, I'm
[35:22] told I'm told it's around 53
[35:26] uh total great grandchildren and
[35:29] grandchildren and so on. So it's not
[35:31] it's not a family anymore. It's a tribe.
[35:35] I now have gone to a tribe and from a
[35:38] tribe we will go to a village and I hope
[35:40] that's as far as it goes. But anyway, uh
[35:44] you know we are really helpless when it
[35:48] comes to our children. Oh, so your
[35:51] wife's pregnant? Oh, uh what what kind
[35:56] of a child is it going to be? I don't
[35:57] know. Oh, you mean to tell me something
[36:00] that important and God hasn't asked your
[36:04] input into it? Uh, you you're
[36:08] instrumental in bringing it, but you
[36:10] don't know the color of the hair, the
[36:12] color of the eyes, the kind of
[36:14] temperament it's going to be. You don't
[36:17] know anything. You don't know whether
[36:18] it'll have any skills or whether it'll
[36:20] have any special gifts or whether it'll
[36:23] be smart or, you know, dumb.
[36:28] whatever
[36:30] whether it'll be skilled and go places
[36:33] in the university or you know and reach
[36:37] some kind of stardom. You don't know any
[36:39] of those things and God hasn't consulted
[36:42] with you or whoever God is.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; He hasn't consulted with you on that and
[36:48] you don't even know if it's a boy or a
[36:49] girl. Now, now it's been born and now
[36:52] you're really smart and you're going to
[36:55] instruct it and tell it which way it's
[36:57] going to go. But then even then, you're
[36:59] not too sure what it's going to do. Is
[37:02] it going to be a credit? And I just say,
[37:05] "Father, uh you know all about us. You
[37:10] know all about us. You brought us here
[37:13] and we are here to fulfill your purpose.
[37:16] And I trust that this morning we'll do
[37:18] some of that.
[37:22] I'm going to read scripture in a few
[37:24] moments, but I want to put up two or
[37:28] three slides first. And uh
[37:45] I wonder if we can have the lights down.
[37:48] I don't want you to miss.
[37:51] You said, "Well, we've read the
[37:52] scripture before. That's that's that's
[37:54] not that's in the past. Today is today."
[37:58] Amen.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; And we know
[38:02] that all things work together for good.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; To them that love God,
[38:08] &gt;&gt; to them,
[38:09] &gt;&gt; yes,
[38:10] &gt;&gt; who are the called
[38:12] &gt;&gt; according to his purpose.
[38:17] We know that all things
[38:21] work together for good. doesn't say all
[38:25] things are good, but all things will
[38:28] work together for good.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; It might be very bad in your estimation.
[38:35] It could be very bad. It might be very
[38:38] difficult. It could be very painful,
[38:41] but uh some of our best experiences
[38:44] are difficult and but it works for the
[38:48] good to them that are called according
[38:51] to his purpose. For whom, and now here
[38:54] is the key word to the whole subject. I
[38:58] want you to be listening.
[39:01] For whom he did forno and this is the
[39:05] emphasis brother Brandham puts on it.
[39:08] Forno
[39:11] whom he did forno he also did
[39:14] predestinate.
[39:16] So he forneew them. It was what he knew
[39:19] about you that he allows us to be
[39:23] predestinated
[39:25] to be conformed to the image of his son.
[39:28] That's what we're predestinated for.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; That he might be the firstborn among
[39:34] many brethren. Those are the reasons of
[39:36] his purpose.
[39:39] So that we will be
[39:42] uh resurrected. Oh, there's so many
[39:44] things I want to say. But that's why
[39:48] brother Brandham talks about this
[39:50] message coming as a resurrection of
[39:53] Jesus Christ. How many of you have heard
[39:55] tapes and you've heard him say, "Uh, now
[40:00] that we might prove that he's raised
[40:03] from the dead, there's a resurrection in
[40:05] the message is a resurrection." And
[40:08] you've had a resurrection.
[40:11] It was predestinated that you should
[40:14] hear the message for the purpose of
[40:18] participating in the resurrection of
[40:20] Jesus Christ and furthermore to
[40:23] resurrect you that you may be a part of
[40:28] his family that he may be the brethren
[40:31] that he might be the firstborn among
[40:34] many brethren. Right.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Moreover,
[40:38] whom he did predestinate
[40:41] them he also called
[40:44] and whom he called them he also
[40:48] justified to it's end of subject. He has
[40:53] justified the people.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; We want to say glory be to God.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Right away your mind says oh well I've
[41:02] been this and I've been that. But this
[41:05] is what God has said. He has justified
[41:09] you. This is all in his plan and in his
[41:12] program.
[41:14] And them he also justified.
[41:17] And whom he justified them he also
[41:21] glorified. Not them minus two or them
[41:25] minus 10 or them minus some
[41:27] denomination. It is them he also
[41:31] justified and them he also glorified.
[41:34] What shall we say
[41:36] &gt;&gt; to these things? If God be for us, who
[41:40] can be against us?
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't that perfect? Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Now, and I I I just wanted to read
[41:48] because I was I'm interested to know and
[41:51] curious to know why this has to be such
[41:55] a a monstrous subject.
[42:00] Well, if you read about if you want to
[42:03] go into the international bible
[42:06] encyclopedia,
[42:07] it will tell you that
[42:10] u and brother talks about calvinism and
[42:13] armaniumism. That's the two sides.
[42:17] Now,
[42:18] uh it it will tell you that there's the
[42:21] Lutheran aspect. There's a reformed
[42:24] aspect of predestination. There's a
[42:28] Lutheran aspect. And incidentally, I
[42:30] want to say to you that are Sunday
[42:32] school teachers and to you that are
[42:34] teachers in BCA, you are teachers of
[42:39] these children that have been birthed
[42:42] into whether it be this fellowship or
[42:45] these people, they are their parents or
[42:48] their grandparents, whatever more do
[42:52] honor to God by taking these truths that
[42:56] come over this pulpit and break it found
[42:59] for our children. Not that you make it a
[43:02] a preaching service. That's not it. But
[43:04] you just encourage them on in in this
[43:08] way. Life is not difficult. Life is
[43:11] difficult for them. Life is very very
[43:14] harsh. The world is very harsh and the
[43:18] living this life and making its
[43:20] decisions are very difficult and very
[43:24] complicated and emotionally
[43:27] uh have an emotional effect upon our
[43:31] children. So prepare them.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Do your very best to prepare them in the
[43:37] Sunday school classes and in the uh
[43:40] teaching. Uh we had a a sister here some
[43:44] years ago and she said, "I listen to the
[43:47] preaching that comes over the pulpit and
[43:50] then I seek to take it that and break it
[43:53] down so it can be understood by the
[43:56] children, small children in the
[43:58] classes." And I thought that was very
[44:00] very nice and I would like to suggest
[44:03] that to you to be sure that this is
[44:06] what's in your heart. I want to live and
[44:09] I just want to say some things that will
[44:12] prepare our young people for the things
[44:15] that they're going to face. We've just
[44:17] graduate had quite a number of graduate
[44:20] and uh they're going to various higher
[44:24] levels of education whatever more uh it
[44:28] it it might benefit you. I it might
[44:33] because it when you when you go into an
[44:36] office and you say you've graduated from
[44:39] such and such a place from UBC SFU or
[44:43] University of Washington, Western
[44:44] Washington or whatever more that means
[44:47] something to the world, but it doesn't
[44:50] mean a whole lot to you
[44:53] &gt;&gt; because you have gotten you're tied into
[44:56] an education that is so far beyond what
[45:00] the man could. And so in this
[45:03] encyclopedia when I read it, I just read
[45:05] it to maybe
[45:08] learn something or get a tidbit of
[45:11] sometimes I read something to say why
[45:14] did you people miss how could you miss
[45:17] whom he forneew? How how could you miss
[45:20] that and make such a monstrous problem
[45:23] out of predestination?
[45:25] And so here comes the messenger.
[45:29] And incidentally,
[45:31] maybe I even have a
[45:39] and unto the angel of the church of the
[45:42] Leodyans.
[45:44] And unto, if you have a pen and you want
[45:47] to put a piece of paper down, this is
[45:49] not unto Joe Blow across the street.
[45:53] This is unto the messenger
[45:55] of the church of the Leodysians. Right?
[46:00] &gt;&gt; These things saith the amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; That's so be it.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; The faithful and true witness.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; That's what he is.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; The beginning of the creation of God.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; God doesn't make a mistake. But man
[46:23] might
[46:24] &gt;&gt; make a mess of things. And so God
[46:26] started again.
[46:28] He started with the creation of God.
[46:30] This is important. The beginning of the
[46:33] creation of God.
[46:39] And this is at the end of Revelation.
[46:41] Revelation 215 and 6.
[46:45] And he that sat upon the throne said,
[46:48] "Behold,
[46:50] I make all things new."
[46:53] &gt;&gt; And he said unto me, "Right, for these
[46:56] things are true and faithful."
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; And he said unto me, "It is done.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; I am alpha and omega."
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; That's the beginning and the end,
[47:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; The beginning and the end. And I will
[47:14] give unto him that is a thirst
[47:17] of the fountain of the water of life
[47:21] freely. I trust you are thirsting this
[47:25] morning and you'll say, "Oh God,
[47:29] &gt;&gt; uh giver of life,
[47:31] &gt;&gt; whoever you are, if you're visiting or
[47:35] just happen to be in this service,
[47:38] there's one thing you want to desire.
[47:41] God."
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[47:43] Jesus, how should we pray? The disciples
[47:46] said, notice what he said. Say, our
[47:50] father.
[47:52] And I said to myself this morning,
[47:54] Jesus, I'm so glad you said that.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Your father is my father,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; our father,
[48:03] which art in heaven.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Hallowed be your I didn't come here for
[48:09] a show. I didn't come here to be some
[48:15] &gt;&gt; skilled person. I just came here to
[48:18] further your kingdom.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; That's my purpose.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Help me.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Help me, Father, to glorify your kingdom
[48:29] and advance your kingdom. In fact is I'm
[48:32] tired of these people that make promises
[48:36] and can't keep them and they go into
[48:39] churches and they want to do good things
[48:42] and they want to bring people to truth
[48:44] but they don't have access to the truth.
[48:47] You have given us access. You have
[48:49] confirmed it.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; And he said unto me, it is done. I am
[48:57] Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
[49:00] end. I will give unto him that is a
[49:03] thirst of the water of life freely.
[49:07] Now, if you'd like to stand, I want to
[49:09] read some scripture.
[49:13] Turn to please to Romans the 9th
[49:15] chapter. And you can turn the lights up,
[49:17] please.
[49:20] Romans the 9th chapter.
[49:29] We're going to read at verse starting at
[49:31] verse 7
[49:38] down to verse 17. Those 10 verses.
[49:48] Heavenly Father,
[49:50] &gt;&gt; now as we read your
[49:53] scripture
[49:56] written by the Apostle Paul,
[49:59] Father, give us understanding.
[50:01] I pray you'll take away every doubt. I
[50:06] pray you'll take away every human
[50:08] reasoning
[50:10] &gt;&gt; where the people will say, "Father,
[50:14] I just open myself up
[50:17] &gt;&gt; to the will of the Holy Spirit. Come, oh
[50:21] spirit of God, anoint the speaker and
[50:24] anoint me to hear in Jesus name. And he
[50:28] that opened the eyes and the
[50:30] understanding of the disciples after the
[50:34] resurrection, come in this resurrection
[50:37] and open my eyes and my understanding in
[50:40] Jesus' name. Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] Verse seven of Romans 9.
[50:53] Neither because they
[50:56] are the seed of Abraham are they all
[50:59] children.
[51:01] But in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
[51:05] In Isaac he was promised.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Shall thy seed be called. I will call
[51:11] them by the promise.
[51:16] That is they that are the children of
[51:20] the flesh. These are not the children of
[51:23] God, but the children of the promise are
[51:27] counted for seed. That's absolute.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do nothing about that.
[51:34] For this is the word of promise. At this
[51:38] time will I come and Sarah shall have a
[51:41] son.
[51:44] Notice now
[51:47] in fact there's this great question
[51:50] about
[51:51] what's right and what's wrong and can
[51:53] God predestinate or can't he
[51:55] predestinate? You mean don't I have a
[51:57] choice? Well, you do within certain you
[52:01] can make wrong decisions, you can make
[52:03] right decisions and but there's a a
[52:06] certain limitation.
[52:08] No one can do away with God's right to
[52:14] making a decree.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; And he makes certain decrees and that's
[52:18] all there is to it.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Whom I bless, I bless. Period. Finish.
[52:23] He's not asking anybody's assistance or
[52:26] he's not asking anybody's uh recognition
[52:29] of it. Oh, we'll honor him. He doesn't
[52:31] care whether you honor or you disgrace
[52:33] them. Whom I bless, I bless. And whom he
[52:37] curses, he curses. That's all there is
[52:39] to it.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; For this is the word of promise at this
[52:45] time will I come and Sarah shall have a
[52:50] son. That's all there is to it. Right?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; And not only this, but when Rebecca also
[52:57] had conceived by one, and we've
[52:59] conceived by one,
[53:02] even by our father Isaac,
[53:06] for the children being not yet born,
[53:11] neither having
[53:13] done any good or evil,
[53:16] that the purpose of God according to
[53:19] election might stand and not of works,
[53:24] but of him that calleth.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; It was said unto her, "The elder shall
[53:31] serve the younger." They're not even
[53:33] born yet.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; She doesn't even know who they are.
[53:38] Said, "The younger shall serve the
[53:40] elder." And and she doesn't even know
[53:43] who they are. Or the elder shall serve
[53:45] the younger. I'm sorry. The elder shall
[53:48] serve the younger. And it is written,
[53:52] Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I
[53:55] hated.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; What shall we say then?
[54:00] Is there unrighteousness with God? God
[54:03] forbid.
[54:05] For he saith to Moses,
[54:08] I will have mercy on whom I will have
[54:11] mercy,
[54:13] and I will have compens compassion on
[54:16] whom I will have compassion.
[54:19] So then it is not of him that willth,
[54:23] nor of him that runth, but of God that
[54:27] showeth mercy. For the scripture saith
[54:31] unto Pharaoh, even for this uh this same
[54:36] purpose, have I raised thee up, that I
[54:40] might show my power in thee, and that my
[54:46] name might be declared throughout all of
[54:49] the earth.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; I I want to shock you a wee bit.
[54:55] Pharaoh was in the predestination,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; right? He was predestinated to become
[55:00] great.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; He was predestinated to be one that God
[55:05] who was delivering Israel would show his
[55:08] power in. And he did do that and to his
[55:13] own destruction. But he made decisions.
[55:15] I will not let the people go. So that
[55:18] was his decision. But the ultimate was
[55:21] God made the ultimate determination.
[55:24] I've raised you up. I've made you
[55:27] powerful. God makes America what America
[55:30] is supposed to be. God makes the rest of
[55:33] the nations what they are supposed to
[55:35] be. And God will raise people up. They
[55:38] may be make their own decisions as to
[55:41] what they're going to do. It's fine. But
[55:43] in the end,
[55:47] &gt;&gt; in the end,
[55:49] &gt;&gt; it's God's purpose
[55:51] &gt;&gt; that will be fulfilled.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] You may be seated.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; How far back does predestination go
[56:08] to our date of birth or prior to our
[56:11] date of birth? Now if you understand
[56:15] and I'm I'm standing here today
[56:19] uh with a very very deep burden and that
[56:22] is that you will see and appreciate how
[56:27] the message came.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; And I want to tie it to the scripture
[56:33] that says write
[56:35] to the messenger of Leodysian church.
[56:39] write these things to him and tell him
[56:43] I'm the alpha and the omega. So, brother
[56:46] Brandham comes on the scene and I have
[56:48] some of his earlier
[56:51] uh thoughts and messages.
[56:54] He said he said concerning
[56:57] uh
[56:59] the predestination. He says there's two
[57:01] schools of thought. This is in 1955 and
[57:05] the waters of separation. This is early
[57:08] in his ministry. Now, keep that in your
[57:10] mind. Watch how he's approaching this
[57:13] subject,
[57:16] right? To the messenger of the church.
[57:19] That was way back then. And here we are
[57:22] today
[57:24] living in the days that the messenger
[57:27] came. So now you need to really grasp if
[57:30] you want to understand what the
[57:33] messenger how he did this. There's two
[57:38] schools of thought. One of them is
[57:41] Calvinistic
[57:43] and the other one is Armenian.
[57:47] Well, of course, you know, I belonged to
[57:50] the Calvinistic school. So then being a
[57:54] Baptist,
[57:55] so so then what it did both of them run
[58:00] out on limbs.
[58:03] Both of them run out on limbs.
[58:06] One went to seed this way and one went
[58:10] to seed the other way. But I think the
[58:13] book of Ephesians.
[58:15] So now I read I began reading the book
[58:18] of Ephesians last night. And I would
[58:21] recommend to this congregation that you
[58:24] go home and read the book of Ephesians.
[58:28] Yes, sir.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Uh, but I think that the book of
[58:31] Ephesians brings them both
[58:34] right back and puts them in the in the
[58:39] stump where they belong.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Puts them back in the tree where they
[58:44] belong. So, I really like the book of
[58:47] Ephesians. It kind of keeps us
[58:50] straightened out, brethren, in our
[58:53] theology,
[58:55] doesn't it? the book of Ephesians. And I
[58:58] like it real well.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; I thought that that's good for us.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Read that book. It's only five chapters,
[59:07] I think.
[59:10] And and then in 55 the same year, he's
[59:14] writing and I'd like I'd like you to
[59:16] note space special note. He said, "Where
[59:20] I think Pentecost failed."
[59:26] That's the title. Where I think
[59:29] Pentecost failed.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Now, he's speaking here of what God did
[59:36] for us before the foundation of the
[59:38] world.
[59:40] Now, I realize that I'm talking to both
[59:43] Calvinists and Armenians.
[59:46] He's starting very early in his
[59:48] ministry. He says, "I realize
[59:51] and hear the angel of God speaking to
[59:54] John 2,000 years ago. Write these things
[59:59] for the messenger of the seventh
[1:00:01] church."
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; And have him say this. Tell this. Tell
[1:00:06] him who's talking.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; And here he is 2,000 years ago. And
[1:00:11] you're sitting here listening. And I'm
[1:00:13] sitting there reading his message last
[1:00:16] night. And you free to listen. listen to
[1:00:18] it or hear it and you can hear him
[1:00:22] fulfilling what the angel of the Lord
[1:00:24] told John to write to this messenger.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Tell him. And now here he's starting out
[1:00:32] and he's saying both the Calvinists and
[1:00:35] the Armenians and I'm a Calvinist. He
[1:00:37] was born in this age same as you are.
[1:00:41] And as long as Calvin stays in the
[1:00:44] Bible, then after that I'm an Armenian.
[1:00:49] As long as Calvin stays in the Bible,
[1:00:54] then if he leaves that, then I'm an
[1:00:56] Armenian. I believe in the grace of God
[1:01:00] to keep the believer, but I believe that
[1:01:03] the believer has to have enough grace of
[1:01:07] God to stay with God. Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; I believe in security of the church. I
[1:01:16] believe the church hath security.
[1:01:20] And if you're in the church, you're
[1:01:23] secured with the church. As long as you
[1:01:27] are in the church, stay in. Don't be in.
[1:01:31] Don't be wandering around tossed about
[1:01:35] by everything. stay in Christ Jesus. And
[1:01:40] God has for ordained that the church
[1:01:44] should appear before him
[1:01:48] before him holy, blameless, without spot
[1:01:51] or wrinkle. No matter whether you are
[1:01:54] whether you make it or uh or I make it,
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; God's going to have a church without
[1:02:02] spot or blemish. I trust that uh we'll
[1:02:07] all be there, but we each have to seek
[1:02:11] out our own salvation with fear and
[1:02:15] trembling. And then in the infallibility
[1:02:19] of God's spoken word in 56, he says
[1:02:23] these things,
[1:02:26] those who he has called, he hath already
[1:02:30] justified.
[1:02:32] Those he hath justified, he hath he had
[1:02:37] already glorified.
[1:02:40] That's right. That's where we get grace
[1:02:43] and works mixed up. Here's the whole
[1:02:47] thing in the Armenian and Calvinistic
[1:02:52] belief. Grace is what God does for you.
[1:02:57] Works is what you do for God.
[1:03:02] It's grace that brings you to God.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; It's the works that you do for God.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Works is what we do for God. And you'll
[1:03:13] never give you'll never
[1:03:16] you'll never put um that ahead of the
[1:03:20] grace that God
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; And and works will never seem like any
[1:03:25] works. Say, "I I just did what I thought
[1:03:27] I should do."
[1:03:29] We don't feel we earn anything by that.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; All right. Now
[1:03:35] I want to show you slide number one.
[1:03:51] Let's see.
[1:04:05] said, "And we're going to speak on a
[1:04:07] subject."
[1:04:10] We're going to speak on a subject
[1:04:13] in the book of Ephesians,
[1:04:15] which is very a very treacherous thing.
[1:04:20] Look how he's approaching it.
[1:04:22] He's letting the people know this is a
[1:04:25] very treacherous thing.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And it's not at all sent to the
[1:04:34] unbeliever.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; If you're an unbeliever here in the
[1:04:38] congregation, I certainly don't know
[1:04:40] everyone. But if you don't believe,
[1:04:43] that is uh that's supreme.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, I can just sit here and
[1:04:49] figure it out for myself." You go right
[1:04:51] ahead. been a lot smarter people than
[1:04:53] you.
[1:04:56] Way ahead of time, way before you. Smart
[1:04:59] smart people, morally good people,
[1:05:03] righteously living people. That's not
[1:05:05] what this is. This is the grace of God.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; God, we have to come to a place where we
[1:05:12] say God Almighty is God. He does what
[1:05:17] he's pleased to do. And there isn't a
[1:05:20] thing in the world you can do about it.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; He does what pleases him.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And it's not sent to the unbeliever.
[1:05:38] It's dedicated.
[1:05:40] It's dedicated. This is completely to
[1:05:43] the believer. Ephesians 1:3-5.
[1:05:48] Now, blessed be the God and father of
[1:05:51] our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
[1:05:54] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:05:58] heavenly places in Christ according as
[1:06:01] he has chosen us in him before the
[1:06:04] foundation of the world. So, it goes
[1:06:08] before we will talk a little bit about
[1:06:10] your birth, but we it goes way beyond
[1:06:13] that.
[1:06:16] You young ladies that are here and young
[1:06:18] men that are here, your parents didn't
[1:06:21] have a thing to do with who you are.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; You might have some of their traits
[1:06:30] as I do. You have some of their
[1:06:33] appearance
[1:06:35] as you do.
[1:06:38] And you may have some of your mother's
[1:06:40] traits or some of your father's traits,
[1:06:42] but they had no hand in that determining
[1:06:48] that
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; there is another intelligence
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; who has produced you and you've got to
[1:06:54] come to the place where you say I am who
[1:06:58] I am and I am by the grace of God what I
[1:07:02] am and whatever I am whatever I can be I
[1:07:06] will just be the best I can for the
[1:07:08] kingdom of God.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; It's not this world. This world is rank.
[1:07:14] This world is sinful
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; and this world is bent on hell. It's
[1:07:20] bent to go there. And I I don't plan to
[1:07:22] go there. It's not my as as Marilyn
[1:07:26] wrote in the song, I don't feel welcome
[1:07:29] here anymore in this world. I don't feel
[1:07:32] welcome. It's uh the the the uh the
[1:07:35] education isn't taking me really the way
[1:07:37] I want to go. The whole system is not I
[1:07:41] just don't feel welcome. It's not my
[1:07:44] kind of place.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; I am a citizen of another country. I'm a
[1:07:50] citizen of a holy place.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; And I I desire leaders that will stay by
[1:07:56] their word and be able to keep their
[1:07:59] promises. And do you know there is a
[1:08:02] kingdom such as that? It's called the
[1:08:04] kingdom of God.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; And God says, "I have a I have chosen
[1:08:08] you as a peculiar people."
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; You're not to feel at home.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; According as he has chosen us in him
[1:08:19] before the foundation of the world, that
[1:08:21] we should be holy and without blame
[1:08:24] before him in love, having predestinated
[1:08:28] us. I wonder if we could say that having
[1:08:32] predestinated us, do you include
[1:08:35] yourself in the us?
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, I certainly do. I must do that
[1:08:40] because I am a believer of this word.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Even when there are times when you feel
[1:08:47] very
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; destitute and very distant from God.
[1:08:52] That is irrelevant to being able to
[1:08:55] agree with what God has said. He has
[1:08:59] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:09:02] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; according to the purpose the good
[1:09:11] pleasure of his will. I'm here, you are
[1:09:14] here, we are in church here to hear
[1:09:17] these things that we can benefit the
[1:09:20] kingdom of God. And if my part is to
[1:09:23] encourage my children or encourage you
[1:09:26] or whatever my part is, we'll do that
[1:09:29] with a willingness and we trust God will
[1:09:33] bless it. And don't be caught up in the
[1:09:36] fact that who you're going to marry or
[1:09:39] who who you're going to have as children
[1:09:42] or whatever. There are things that take
[1:09:44] place that uh I I will say make your
[1:09:48] decisions, godly decisions.
[1:09:51] Amen.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Now, there's nothing wrong with what I'm
[1:09:55] saying,
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; I know that that's correct. Make them
[1:09:59] godly decisions. Do the best you can.
[1:10:02] And if you make a mistake, don't stop.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Put another bullet in the gun and pull a
[1:10:07] trigger.
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:22] All right.
[1:10:27] So he starts talking about this subject.
[1:10:32] The messenger
[1:10:34] to this church age goes back to the
[1:10:38] record of creation
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; showing predestination
[1:10:43] to the children of the new creation.
[1:10:48] Now, you've got to think I I've been
[1:10:50] turning this around my mind, trying to
[1:10:57] I want to be very specific. I've been
[1:10:59] trying to say now, is that really what I
[1:11:03] want to say?
[1:11:05] Is that really what I feel God telling
[1:11:08] me in my heart?
[1:11:10] And so, this was the best I can do.
[1:11:15] the messenger to this church age.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; He goes back. Well, when he goes back,
[1:11:20] he says this is a very treacherous
[1:11:22] subject.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; When he goes back, he actually says, uh,
[1:11:29] predestination isn't a good word.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; He says another place, predestination is
[1:11:35] a bad word. And I might I might be
[1:11:38] repeating myself.
[1:11:41] Why does he say predestination's bad
[1:11:43] word? He says that fornowledge is a best
[1:11:46] word is a better word.
[1:11:48] And why is it the better word? Because
[1:11:51] we believe in God. I know you believe in
[1:11:54] God. Do you believe that he's almighty?
[1:11:56] Well, yeah. I I believe he's almighty.
[1:11:59] Well, do you believe he's all knowing
[1:12:01] God?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. But I might make a decision
[1:12:07] that's out of his knowing. No.
[1:12:10] then then you haven't got the same God
[1:12:12] I'm talking about. This God is all
[1:12:15] knowing. He and and and the prophet of
[1:12:19] God says and I I said I I may be
[1:12:21] repeating myself so I expect that later
[1:12:24] on again. And he says now he's all
[1:12:28] knowing if he's not all knowing he's not
[1:12:31] God.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; And in order to be almighty he has to
[1:12:35] forno what's going to happen. So that
[1:12:38] brings the fornowledge in. That's the
[1:12:40] key
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; that great theologians missed.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, God has elevated you
[1:12:47] above many that come before you. Many of
[1:12:51] you have studied and have written
[1:12:53] volumes and volumes of books, but they
[1:12:56] keep missing.
[1:12:59] They keep missing it. That's why I don't
[1:13:01] understand people talk about uh the
[1:13:05] creation. These wise people, I've even
[1:13:08] heard them on the radio. They talk about
[1:13:10] and they start mocking the word of God.
[1:13:14] They speak of it. Well, you know, do you
[1:13:18] believe that? Do you believe, you know,
[1:13:20] some people actually believe he made it
[1:13:22] in seven days?
[1:13:24] Hello, folks.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Uh, you've been through universities and
[1:13:28] everything else and you've missed a
[1:13:29] period.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:13:34] You missed just a period. In the
[1:13:36] beginning, God created the heavens and
[1:13:38] the earth. Period.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; He didn't say if he did it in one year,
[1:13:44] 10 years, a million years, a billion
[1:13:46] years. Who cares?
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Our duty is to belong to believe it.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; We believe it. In the beginning, God
[1:13:55] created the heaven and the earth.
[1:13:56] Period.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; So, we don't know how long it took.
[1:13:59] People say, "Well, what do you think?" I
[1:14:01] don't think about it. All right. This is
[1:14:03] what I was telling my wife just a few
[1:14:05] days ago
[1:14:07] and I I maybe I'll be able to explain
[1:14:10] what I told her. I've come to a great
[1:14:13] peace, a great rest.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; And it's not that I'm just older. I've
[1:14:20] come to a great peace.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; A great rest.
[1:14:24] And you know when that really happened,
[1:14:26] it kind of climaxed
[1:14:29] when I was on not laying on a slab yet,
[1:14:33] but I was laying on a bed and I I knew I
[1:14:37] was going to go in. They were going to
[1:14:40] take my heart out and do something.
[1:14:43] And I thought I kind of came to a jolt.
[1:14:46] I've told you this before, but now I
[1:14:48] tell you in in the context of a
[1:14:51] scripture.
[1:14:55] I want to deal with you as smart people,
[1:14:58] but I've been a little further down the
[1:15:00] road
[1:15:02] and I know that there's a place whether
[1:15:04] it's Bill Gates and his billions or
[1:15:07] Allen his friend and his billions or or
[1:15:10] somebody here who's living on the
[1:15:12] streets of Vancouver who hasn't got a
[1:15:14] penny. There's one place where everybody
[1:15:18] finds common ground and it's it's called
[1:15:21] a slab.
[1:15:23] a cold slab in the mortuary
[1:15:27] and you all and I didn't know but what I
[1:15:29] was just seconds away from it.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; You know what?
[1:15:38] You got to be there sometime,
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; And I thought
[1:15:44] maybe I'm not going to see my my
[1:15:47] children. I I thought they're my
[1:15:49] children now. Whoever gave me life is
[1:15:53] maybe taking it away. I don't know. And
[1:15:55] I finally decided I don't know.
[1:16:00] And I I say to you in that state I
[1:16:04] thought the record's been written
[1:16:08] and uh
[1:16:10] I don't have any regrets.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, my friends, you want to
[1:16:18] be able to say that.
[1:16:22] And you might be five minutes from that,
[1:16:26] you might be five years, you might be 50
[1:16:29] years from it. It'll go by just like
[1:16:31] that,
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; And then that day comes and you say,
[1:16:37] uh,
[1:16:39] I may be in the presence of God.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; This is what went through my mind in the
[1:16:44] next few minutes.
[1:16:47] That's the first thing that came to me.
[1:16:49] I might be in the presence of God in the
[1:16:51] next few minutes.
[1:16:53] And item number two was maybe I've seen
[1:16:57] my wife for the last time.
[1:17:00] Maybe I've seen my children for the last
[1:17:02] time. I may not see them again.
[1:17:06] And that was a that was not just a
[1:17:09] thought. That was an absolute reality. I
[1:17:13] I'm laying here and I might be in the
[1:17:16] presence of God in a few minutes and I
[1:17:18] might not see my family again.
[1:17:22] That was a very very real possibility.
[1:17:27] And I had uh
[1:17:29] the third thing I had a peace.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; And I have to I have to stay with you
[1:17:37] and you stay with me. Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And in the many months that have
[1:17:42] followed,
[1:17:44] every once in a while, that peace was so
[1:17:46] wonderful.
[1:17:49] That peace that passes all
[1:17:51] understanding. I couldn't understand
[1:17:53] this peace.
[1:17:55] I'm talking to you now.
[1:17:59] Every once in a while, I told this to my
[1:18:02] wife. I turn and I I say I want to think
[1:18:06] about those days. I want to think about
[1:18:10] that time.
[1:18:12] And there were some things that that's
[1:18:15] why I had your brothers, brother Nathan
[1:18:17] and and brother
[1:18:21] uh Haynes
[1:18:24] and Michael come and sing with me.
[1:18:30] I wanted to sing.
[1:18:33] the master. I met the master.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; And that's what I was thinking about
[1:18:39] while I was laying there. I thought, I
[1:18:41] met the master.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; So glad you came to me. I was standing
[1:18:47] here on this platform looking up in the
[1:18:50] balcony over there. I don't know why
[1:18:51] this maybe three years ago. I thought
[1:18:54] and the congregation was singing. Maybe
[1:18:56] you were leading, brother Brian. I I
[1:18:59] don't know. Brother Ryan,
[1:19:01] he came to me.
[1:19:06] You know, there are things that we just,
[1:19:08] you know, we sing and we just say and
[1:19:10] scriptures that we just repeat. Listen
[1:19:13] to me, friends.
[1:19:15] I'm talking to you now.
[1:19:19] And I just said, "You You came to me.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; You came to me. You knew where I was.
[1:19:28] You came to me way up in my country.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; A little kid up in the sticks. You came
[1:19:35] to me.
[1:19:37] You came to the woman at the well. I
[1:19:39] thought of her that you came to me.
[1:19:43] I couldn't come to you. I don't know
[1:19:45] where you I didn't know how to find you,
[1:19:48] but you came to me.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Friends, that's the God that we serve.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; That is the God of this message. If I
[1:19:56] didn't believe that, uh, I would have I
[1:19:59] would have been filled with fear. But I
[1:20:01] was filled with absolute peace. Peace
[1:20:04] that passes all understanding. I don't
[1:20:06] even know how to explain it.
[1:20:10] Can I go for a few more minutes?
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:17] You young people and children that are
[1:20:19] here.
[1:20:28] Our bodies
[1:20:30] are made up of oh cosmic light
[1:20:35] and petroleum and so forth.
[1:20:39] Now I brother Mila you were with me. We
[1:20:42] were in my office and there was a
[1:20:44] professor
[1:20:46] from the UK
[1:20:48] here and he was in there. He actually
[1:20:53] asked me if I would be his pastor.
[1:20:56] He had a reason. He wanted to ask me a
[1:20:59] certain question
[1:21:01] and he said
[1:21:04] he wanted to write and he he was writing
[1:21:06] books
[1:21:08] on the comingings of Elijah, the five
[1:21:10] comingings of Elijah.
[1:21:13] And he had a problem with
[1:21:17] that says that
[1:21:20] our bodies are made of cosmic light and
[1:21:24] petroleum. He said, "Our bodies aren't
[1:21:27] made of petroleum."
[1:21:29] He said, "There's no petroleum in our
[1:21:31] bodies."
[1:21:34] I didn't argue with him at all. I just
[1:21:36] thought, "Well, let a Mac truck run over
[1:21:38] you and they'll say it was just a little
[1:21:40] grease spot."
[1:21:44] I thought, "Where where the grease spot
[1:21:46] comes from, maybe there is a little
[1:21:48] petroleum." I don't know.
[1:21:50] But this piece is so great that I was
[1:21:53] just saying to you there's nothing wrong
[1:21:57] with saying I don't know.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; We don't have to.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I was looking at one of our young men
[1:22:06] and we were standing in the I said you
[1:22:09] have children in you. You don't know
[1:22:12] anything about them.
[1:22:14] You know are they
[1:22:16] what color are they? You know what color
[1:22:18] hair are they going to have? What kind
[1:22:21] of a guy is this going to be? What kind
[1:22:22] of a girl is it going to be? You don't
[1:22:24] know.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Then good, bad, indifferent, I don't
[1:22:28] know. Skilled, smart, dumb, beautiful,
[1:22:32] ugly, I don't know. It doesn't make any
[1:22:35] difference to me. It's going to be the
[1:22:37] gift of God.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of saying I don't know.
[1:22:44] And I I found that where prophet said
[1:22:47] that a prophet
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; who's actually the most peace of God.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; He's asked questions. He says I don't
[1:22:55] know. He was asked about predestination.
[1:22:58] I'm going to read it for you
[1:23:04] in a few moments.
[1:23:06] But he said our bodies are made up of
[1:23:08] cosmic light and petroleums and so
[1:23:11] forth. But they come from somewhere.
[1:23:16] They wasn't here.
[1:23:20] Then they are then they are not again.
[1:23:24] But God knows
[1:23:27] this is in the message called pride. But
[1:23:30] God knows every atom that's holding your
[1:23:33] body together.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hello bodies. God knows every atom
[1:23:39] that holds your body together.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; God knows every atom that's holding your
[1:23:47] body together. every speck of light,
[1:23:51] every corpusle,
[1:23:53] every cell,
[1:23:55] every bit of petroleum and all the
[1:23:58] calcium
[1:24:00] and phosphate,
[1:24:02] what everything that goes in a human
[1:24:05] body that came out of the earth. He
[1:24:09] knows right where every speck
[1:24:12] laying. And someday your spirit will be
[1:24:16] turned loose and it'll scream for its
[1:24:19] life and not an old man or an old woman.
[1:24:24] Your spirit's not going to say, "Oh,
[1:24:26] come back, old man. Old woman."
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; No. We'll say, "I'm glad I've been
[1:24:30] released from this."
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Is this Is this making any sense to you?
[1:24:40] Now I'm going to go way off.
[1:24:44] And you might say, "Oh, Brother Biscll,
[1:24:46] he dropped off the deep end."
[1:24:50] But I have I have I have some place I
[1:24:53] have some reason for saying this.
[1:24:57] When God said in the beginning, I'm
[1:24:59] talking about predestination. Now, when
[1:25:02] God said in the beginning, "Let the
[1:25:05] earth bring forth
[1:25:09] and then here comes the prophet saying,
[1:25:11] your bodies were laying in the earth."
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; And then it says, "And then the pot ash
[1:25:18] and the different things began to come
[1:25:20] together." And he begins to describe it.
[1:25:22] And I have it might be some of the
[1:25:24] things I'm going to repeat. But but he
[1:25:27] he said it begins to you know kind of
[1:25:29] flow and run together and and then
[1:25:34] and God said right after he says let the
[1:25:36] earth bring forth the herb. And then it
[1:25:40] says again let them bring forth the
[1:25:41] creatures, the flying creatures. Let the
[1:25:44] earth bring it forth. Well you said well
[1:25:47] I learned in science that it was the
[1:25:49] waters that did it. Well, I don't care
[1:25:52] what did it. God did it.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Whoever he is. God did it. My father did
[1:25:58] it.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; My father called for you to come forth.
[1:26:03] Otherwise, you could not be here. Your
[1:26:06] mother and dad only were instruments of
[1:26:09] of allowing it to happen. And they were
[1:26:12] instruments were actually very
[1:26:14] unintelligent,
[1:26:16] ignorant,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; instruments. They just did what life and
[1:26:21] marriage allows and you came.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; They didn't know who you were going to
[1:26:27] be. They didn't know what you're going
[1:26:29] to be. They didn't know anything about
[1:26:31] you. And now you're here. You know why
[1:26:33] are you here? I'll tell you why you're
[1:26:35] here. You're here to be a witness of the
[1:26:38] life of God.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; You're here to be a testimony that I
[1:26:43] believe him. I am one that believes him.
[1:26:46] I believe that this is his word. I
[1:26:49] believe he's watched over this word. And
[1:26:52] there's things in this word that I don't
[1:26:54] know.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; But there's a lot in it that I do know.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; That's why he had to send a messenger.
[1:27:03] Now, here comes a messenger. And he
[1:27:05] starts way at the beginning, you know,
[1:27:08] because he even even that God knows is
[1:27:11] going to be a great big
[1:27:14] predestination going to be a major
[1:27:17] problem. And he wants to resolve that
[1:27:19] for he wants you to understand it. And
[1:27:22] that's going to bring you a peace. I'm
[1:27:24] not just here talking. I'm here telling
[1:27:26] you it'll bring you a much needed peace.
[1:27:30] You got questions. You got decisions.
[1:27:34] you got you know why are certain things
[1:27:37] I don't know
[1:27:40] I don't know
[1:27:45] I had a boy a young fellow in my office
[1:27:50] some years ago
[1:27:53] and I always saw that he was he was
[1:27:56] living with his mother and some siblings
[1:28:00] but he didn't have a daddy
[1:28:05] and his daddy in incidentally was in
[1:28:08] prison
[1:28:11] and his daddy got out of prison
[1:28:14] and called me from Bellingham.
[1:28:20] And I said, "Now I can, you're quiet and
[1:28:22] you're listening. I want you to listen."
[1:28:26] And I said, "You left your wife
[1:28:31] and you were you were bad.
[1:28:35] And so God just dropped some revelation
[1:28:37] into my heart and I said, "Are you a
[1:28:40] homosexual?"
[1:28:42] And he said, "Uh, yes."
[1:28:45] I said, "This thing that you did to your
[1:28:48] family didn't happen overnight."
[1:28:51] I said, "It spent some years." It spent
[1:28:54] some years.
[1:28:56] I didn't know anything about him. But
[1:28:58] here I'm telling him what he did and God
[1:29:01] was helping me.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Why? He was because God's trying to save
[1:29:07] him.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; God's trying to
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Well, you understand what I mean?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; God's reaching out to him. This is God's
[1:29:16] mercy.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; He's not willing that any should perish.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care. I don't know how come
[1:29:24] he ended up there. That's not for me to
[1:29:26] know.
[1:29:28] But I I'm dealing with this son about 10
[1:29:31] 12 years old.
[1:29:34] It's just part of my life.
[1:29:37] And I said,
[1:29:40] "You spent several years tearing this
[1:29:42] life, tearing this family apart. Now,
[1:29:46] are you willing to spend a few years
[1:29:48] building it together?"
[1:29:51] Well, he was he wasn't too sure about
[1:29:54] that. And I said, "You better be
[1:29:56] prepared for that.
[1:30:00] We're not going to step in and put
[1:30:02] everything together."
[1:30:05] So I I was dealing with a son, talking
[1:30:07] to his son. I said, "You haven't got
[1:30:10] daddy at home."
[1:30:12] I said, "Uh, and he was in the school.
[1:30:16] You that teach at BCA, you might have
[1:30:19] been here at that time. I'm I'm I'm just
[1:30:23] reaching back into the past now. So,
[1:30:26] don't worry about trying to figure out
[1:30:27] who who it is that that's irrelevant.
[1:30:33] And I said, "You don't have your
[1:30:36] father." And he just took a deep breath
[1:30:39] and stiffened up.
[1:30:43] He didn't want to cry in front of me. He
[1:30:46] was a young man now, and I respected
[1:30:48] that.
[1:30:53] And I said, "Well, I I really liked him.
[1:30:56] I had a love that reached out to him
[1:31:00] and Sister Biscll and I sponsored him in
[1:31:03] the school for several years.
[1:31:07] He went from that he went off into
[1:31:10] someplace else." And is he serving God?
[1:31:12] I that's no, I don't know.
[1:31:16] I was I was responsible for to do what I
[1:31:19] needed to do right then.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; And that was part of the record when I
[1:31:23] was laying on the bed going in. I don't
[1:31:27] Do I regret that? Not a bit.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Did he turn a good boy? I don't know.
[1:31:34] That's not what we're here for.
[1:31:38] You that are teaching in the school,
[1:31:40] you're not teaching because everybody's
[1:31:42] going to end up as angels. They're going
[1:31:44] to You're here to do the best thing you
[1:31:47] can.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm here. I'm here to be full of
[1:31:51] the Holy Ghost. I'm here to teach these
[1:31:54] tender lives. I'm here to show them the
[1:31:57] way."
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:32:09] Just so you don't think that I'm
[1:32:12] I'll just be a few more minutes, but
[1:32:14] just so you don't think that I'm way off
[1:32:16] on a limb someplace, Brother Brandham
[1:32:18] says that God, he's he's like a
[1:32:21] contractor
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; and he's laying out laying our bodies
[1:32:29] on the earth right then.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let the earth bring forth."
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; He was laying our bodies out. Your body
[1:32:39] was actually laying out right then. You
[1:32:42] think he didn't know who you're going to
[1:32:44] be
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; and what you're going to do and who you
[1:32:47] are and then bring some way.
[1:32:53] He'll bring the message.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; So unique.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Only God could think of it. You're
[1:32:59] down your pathway
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; and you'll see it. And
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; something look at look friends, I'm
[1:33:11] trying to preach, but I don't want to
[1:33:13] get preaching.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; I want to talk to you.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; A woman's a woman is coming to the well.
[1:33:22] She's coming to a well. You can read it
[1:33:24] in the John the 4th chapter. So he's
[1:33:27] coming to the well. There's a man
[1:33:28] sitting on the well.
[1:33:31] Just any kind of man. He's a Jewish man
[1:33:35] and he's wearied and he's sitting on the
[1:33:37] well
[1:33:39] and he's not very dramatic.
[1:33:42] He doesn't preach her a profound
[1:33:44] message.
[1:33:45] He's full of truth.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; He's the lifegiver.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; He's the creator of all things. just
[1:33:53] sitting there. Watch how he does it. He
[1:33:56] just sits there, says to the lady, "Give
[1:33:58] me to drink."
[1:34:02] And uh
[1:34:06] he said, "If you knew who I was, I I
[1:34:08] would give you." Then he really became
[1:34:09] strange. "If you knew who I was, you
[1:34:11] would ask me and I'd give you to drink
[1:34:14] and you wouldn't thirst anymore."
[1:34:18] He says, "You haven't got anything to
[1:34:20] draw with." and the well is deep.
[1:34:24] She was predestinated. Hallelujah.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; She had a seed in her and she was
[1:34:29] predestinated
[1:34:31] to that moment.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; But even then, she's in the middle of
[1:34:34] that moment. She doesn't realize
[1:34:37] I'm going to say something to you. You
[1:34:39] were predestinated by God to sit in this
[1:34:43] service
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; and hear what we are hearing and hear
[1:34:47] what I'm speaking and hear what I'm
[1:34:49] reading.
[1:34:51] That's why I want you to really
[1:34:54] say, "Oh, someone else arranged this
[1:34:57] meeting."
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; And in a few moments,
[1:35:08] he said,
[1:35:10] "See, he came I I I I aligned myself
[1:35:13] with her very much because
[1:35:17] he came to her." M
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; she didn't she couldn't come to him. He
[1:35:23] came to her
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; and she was thirsty
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; and she didn't even know she was
[1:35:30] thirsty.
[1:35:32] Finally she said sir ever more give me
[1:35:35] this watermen.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Now she was making some progress.
[1:35:42] He said go and get your husband.
[1:35:45] She says I haven't got a husband.
[1:35:48] That's right. You've had five.
[1:35:52] She wouldn't make you a very good
[1:35:54] neighbor.
[1:35:58] She wouldn't be a very good church
[1:35:59] member.
[1:36:02] You've had five and the one you're with
[1:36:04] now is not your husband.
[1:36:10] Was he ever coming to her address?
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Right. says, "Sir, I believe you're a
[1:36:15] prophet."
[1:36:18] Not only a prophet, the creator
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; sitting there listening to some of his
[1:36:23] creation,
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; it was irrelevant,
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; right? all the troubles she had had
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; and all the disappointments and all the
[1:36:32] bad decisions that she had made, but it
[1:36:35] was irrelevant now
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; when the giver of life was there
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; to bring her to salvation.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; And he said, uh, if you would ask me and
[1:36:48] I'd give you to drink. He said, sir, you
[1:36:51] have nothing. And then she turned
[1:36:53] religious as they all do. This is a
[1:36:56] lesson for you.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; When you when you get close to people's
[1:37:01] need, spiritual need, they all turn
[1:37:03] religious.
[1:37:05] Oh well, our choir or the we have this
[1:37:09] song group or we have this minister that
[1:37:12] has nothing to do with it.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Whether it's good, bad or indifferent,
[1:37:17] that has nothing to do with it.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; This message church, that message church
[1:37:21] has nothing to do with it. It's between
[1:37:24] you and he who come to you.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; And uh
[1:37:35] she went on she said this was her main
[1:37:39] problem and sometimes predestination is
[1:37:43] a big problem.
[1:37:45] Very big problem. I'm going to just
[1:37:46] conclude with it in just a couple
[1:37:48] minutes now. Four or five minutes.
[1:37:52] But she says, "Our fathers say we should
[1:37:55] worship up in this mountain, and you
[1:37:57] Jews say we should worship in this
[1:37:59] city."
[1:38:01] I don't know where to. She wanted to
[1:38:03] worship God, but she didn't know where
[1:38:04] to worship him.
[1:38:07] And he said, "The hour cometh,
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; and now is
[1:38:12] when they that worship God must worship
[1:38:14] him in spirit, in truth."
[1:38:19] and she dropped her water buck. I want
[1:38:21] to ask you, what caused her to drop her
[1:38:23] water bucket?
[1:38:25] What caused her to run into the city?
[1:38:28] What caused her to say? What was it
[1:38:31] driving her now? Come see a man that
[1:38:33] told me all that ever I did. Is this not
[1:38:36] the Messiah?
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; That was it.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; That was it.
[1:38:42] And friends, we're at that hour again.
[1:38:44] Yes,
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; we're there again.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Am I right?
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Why do you think this prophet messenger
[1:38:51] I can they try to pick holes through his
[1:38:54] life and ministry and put things on the
[1:38:57] internet and
[1:38:59] God forgive them.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; They know not what they do either.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; They're trying to crucify
[1:39:07] this message. They can do whatever they
[1:39:10] wish to do. They can't do anything
[1:39:12] against the Almighty God.
[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; All the evil they may try to do will
[1:39:20] only turn to the good.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; You can't fight against this God.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help me.
[1:39:41] I feel sorry for them.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; I really do.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; And I don't have any any feelings.
[1:39:50] People can say whatever they wish to
[1:39:52] say.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Don't let it affect you.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Don't let it bother you at all.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; We just go on serving God.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; That's all we do.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:07] And some of us sometimes we make
[1:40:10] difficult decisions. And I'm standing
[1:40:13] here as a you call me pastor. I don't
[1:40:16] feel that way. I don't feel up to it.
[1:40:19] But nevertheless,
[1:40:22] there has been doctrines that have come
[1:40:24] by,
[1:40:26] strong, powerful doctrines,
[1:40:30] seven thunders,
[1:40:32] perusio,
[1:40:34] all of these things. And people get
[1:40:36] caught away with it. Listen friends,
[1:40:41] I don't discredit them. I don't decize
[1:40:44] them.
[1:40:47] And this is probably the first time I've
[1:40:49] ever said this over this pulpit.
[1:40:53] I don't get up here very often.
[1:40:56] Brother Lee Vale,
[1:40:59] he's a very precious brother. He was
[1:41:02] close to brother Bradom when I was right
[1:41:05] there in the
[1:41:07] attending a meeting or two and we would
[1:41:10] talk about it. But brother Lee Vale
[1:41:15] in fact there's quite a number of
[1:41:18] brothers even from this church got very
[1:41:21] very caught with that as being a
[1:41:24] marvelous truth of him being here.
[1:41:29] I didn't disregard that.
[1:41:32] I thought, well, I will listen to those
[1:41:34] tapes. I will be honest. But as soon as
[1:41:38] they made a reference of the Bible, I
[1:41:41] stopped the tape. And we had Brother
[1:41:44] David Bombless's thick volumes
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; and I would stop the tape and I would
[1:41:50] look through those volumes.
[1:41:53] You might be saying, "What are you
[1:41:54] preaching about, Brother Biscll? That's
[1:41:56] what made this church."
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Very good.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; I wanted to be honest.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to deprive you of anything
[1:42:06] that God had for us.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; And I I I also regarded these men as men
[1:42:12] of God. They they would see something if
[1:42:15] they went off into what I have the right
[1:42:19] to say, well, I think that that's I
[1:42:21] don't want to go there. I don't want to
[1:42:24] go that far. and and you you you say
[1:42:28] this is a glorious truth. And so I would
[1:42:31] stop the tape. I would listen to brother
[1:42:34] veil and you don't know it but I spent I
[1:42:38] spent seven months
[1:42:43] following this pattern in my own I
[1:42:46] didn't involve my wife. I didn't involve
[1:42:48] my family. I didn't involve the church.
[1:42:52] I didn't involve the other ministering
[1:42:54] brothers.
[1:42:57] But I wanted to be sincere. I wanted to
[1:43:01] be able to look in the face of God.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether I had five minutes
[1:43:06] to live or five years or 50 years, but I
[1:43:10] wanted to be able to say,
[1:43:12] I have been honest. I want to know. I'm
[1:43:16] searching out. That's why I handed out
[1:43:18] some pads this morning for you to make a
[1:43:21] note.
[1:43:25] We want to be
[1:43:28] deathbeds
[1:43:30] earnest with this message.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; We don't want to go off on some limb. We
[1:43:35] don't need to go off on some limb. Say,
[1:43:37] "Well, I know this one or I know that or
[1:43:39] I know that." I don't care. We're not
[1:43:42] responsible for other people.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; We're not responsible for what goes on
[1:43:46] in the message. We're responsible for I
[1:43:50] have been brought here. I've been forord
[1:43:53] ordained of God to be here.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; I've been forord orained of God. I've
[1:43:59] been predestinated in the mind of God
[1:44:03] and he came to me.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; He has come to me and he's made himself
[1:44:08] real. He's opened up my hearing. I hear
[1:44:12] hear a him. And I've recognized this is
[1:44:15] him
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; and I recognize this is part of his
[1:44:19] coming. I've seen those things. see
[1:44:21] little tidbits. I've seen uh John the
[1:44:25] Baptist, you know, way back in maybe
[1:44:29] 1972, I'm standing in Rome and uh and
[1:44:33] they're showing a picture of someone
[1:44:36] holding a baby with a halo over his
[1:44:39] head. It's supposed to be Jesus and and
[1:44:42] one standing beside him. And I thought,
[1:44:44] who is that? So I said to the guide, who
[1:44:46] is that that's standing? He said, John
[1:44:49] the Baptist. John the Baptist. I said
[1:44:51] John the Baptist
[1:44:53] has according to the scripture was born
[1:44:56] about the same time as Jesus maybe six
[1:44:58] months different. He said he just said
[1:45:00] allegory allegory allegory allegory. I
[1:45:04] knew already he was as wise as far off
[1:45:07] the base as he could be. That might be
[1:45:10] an allegory to you. It's not an allegory
[1:45:12] to me.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; John the forerunner.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; He had to be close. Yes.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Listen you folks, some of you young
[1:45:22] people that might be here. I might be
[1:45:25] gone, but you'll remember these words.
[1:45:27] The forerunner has to be very close to
[1:45:32] and he says this message will introduce
[1:45:36] Jesus Christ, the bride to Jesus Christ.
[1:45:41] This message is the introduction message
[1:45:44] that's going to introduce you to the
[1:45:46] Lord Jesus Christ. And he is that very
[1:45:50] word. He is he is the message that we've
[1:45:53] received. So So when they began to say
[1:45:56] he's here, I could only say amen. I
[1:45:59] believe that he's here. I still believe
[1:46:01] that. I believe that he's here
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; more than maybe you even realize that
[1:46:06] he's here.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; This Christ,
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; he may not be having any more effect on
[1:46:12] you than he did over on the people in in
[1:46:16] Palestine.
[1:46:18] Oh friends,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; my dear friends, let it move you.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Let your hearts be moved and say, "Ah, I
[1:46:28] love you, Lord.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; I believe all that you've spoken about
[1:46:32] me. I believe all that you have revealed
[1:46:36] of the message to me, and even more so,
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; I don't understand it all, but I believe
[1:46:44] it."
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] I'm just going to read some things and
[1:46:54] then close.
[1:47:01] But we were Could you just shut the
[1:47:03] lines down a wee bit and I want you to
[1:47:06] read this with me. But we were ordained
[1:47:10] predestinated.
[1:47:12] You know what predestinate means?
[1:47:16] The des the destination of anything was
[1:47:20] pre-saw
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; or we made preen but pre-saw by God.
[1:47:26] Amen. That's not skim milk.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; That's not skim milk. Now notice, I
[1:47:35] believe that stumped you. Here he is way
[1:47:40] back in 1953
[1:47:42] saying I believe that stumped you.
[1:47:44] We better go over there just a minute.
[1:47:47] That's why I'm doing it
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; this morning. Turn over with me to
[1:47:53] Ephesians the first chapter which we
[1:47:55] read and let's read just a little cuz
[1:47:58] I'm afraid you're missing that. And just
[1:48:01] thinking I'm saying that I am not.
[1:48:05] Listen closely now. Now Paul is speaking
[1:48:09] addressing Ephesians 1 directly straight
[1:48:13] to the shoulder of the church. That's
[1:48:15] what I that's what we're doing tonight.
[1:48:21] This is not for babies. This is for
[1:48:24] grown-ups,
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; not for babies. Can you say amen for me?
[1:48:31] But if we'd only go back to find out
[1:48:34] when God made his first man, he made man
[1:48:39] in his own image. And God is a spirit.
[1:48:43] So he had to make make spirit man. Now
[1:48:48] the word is used here in the fifth verse
[1:48:52] of predestination.
[1:48:54] Predestinated.
[1:48:56] It's not a very good word for an
[1:48:58] evangelist or a minister to use because
[1:49:01] it kind of confuses people when you say
[1:49:05] predestinate. Predestination looks back
[1:49:08] to fornowledge.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Fore looks to destination.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Predestination goes back to fornowledge
[1:49:19] and fornowledge goes to destination.
[1:49:23] In other words, God didn't say, "Now,
[1:49:26] I'll make this man be this, and I'll
[1:49:29] make this man be that." But in order to
[1:49:32] be God, he had to know the end from the
[1:49:37] beginning. So in order to fornowledge in
[1:49:40] order to fornowledge that he knew he
[1:49:43] could say this will happen and that will
[1:49:48] would happen because he was God and knew
[1:49:52] where everything would be placed and
[1:49:56] therefore he could ordain certain things
[1:49:59] for certain ages. You believe that?
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; That's truly scripture.
[1:50:12] The word predestinate,
[1:50:14] that's not a good word to use. The word
[1:50:18] fornowledge is better. Predestination
[1:50:21] looks back to knowledge.
[1:50:24] And fornowledge looks to destination.
[1:50:30] But
[1:50:32] but God not making set it in order
[1:50:37] a little hole that you have gone to gone
[1:50:41] through and can't go no other way. But
[1:50:46] God in order to be God he knowed the end
[1:50:50] from the beginning. Do you believe that?
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; So he could predict it and set things in
[1:50:56] order to happen. There are things,
[1:50:59] friends, God is not willing that any
[1:51:01] should perish,
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; but God knows all kinds of things. God
[1:51:06] knows every person that's in the and
[1:51:10] actually brought to life. Everybody
[1:51:12] that's in the gay parade, he knows all
[1:51:15] about the gay parade. He knows all about
[1:51:17] those whoever they are, whether they're
[1:51:20] lesbians or whatever more. But that's
[1:51:22] not all he said about it. He said any
[1:51:25] any person wouldn't receive a man's
[1:51:28] seed. You understand this whole Bible?
[1:51:31] Now, I'm really going to unload a couple
[1:51:33] of things. This whole Bible
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; all has to do with the seed.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Right from the opening verses of the
[1:51:40] chapter
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; of Genesis, it has to do with seed.
[1:51:44] God's seed or the serpent's seed. That's
[1:51:48] what it's all about.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's the end of that.
[1:52:24] I just want to make a couple comments
[1:52:27] and then I'm going to close.
[1:52:33] know this this person that's beside you
[1:52:36] or this children that you have and I'm
[1:52:39] very very
[1:52:41] very taken by the children and the young
[1:52:44] people
[1:52:46] they will be the ones that will continue
[1:52:49] on
[1:52:51] this message
[1:52:54] friends
[1:52:56] I have have a passion for this work I
[1:53:00] have a passion for this word and I want
[1:53:03] to announce to you I have a passion for
[1:53:06] the school for BCA. I have a passion for
[1:53:09] the camp. I have a passion for this work
[1:53:15] because this message
[1:53:19] for me it holds the answer that people
[1:53:23] need. Right.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; This message holds the strength for you
[1:53:29] to hang on to,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; for you to hold and be steadfast.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; The wisdom of God is revealed and he has
[1:53:38] brought it right to us in this message.
[1:53:41] And that is why when you come to the
[1:53:44] house of God, we should perhaps come
[1:53:47] differently. We should perhaps come
[1:53:50] planning to make a note, planning to
[1:53:53] make a reference to a scripture
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; and when you pick up a message, it's not
[1:53:58] background music.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; That's not what it is. You say, "Here is
[1:54:03] the key."
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; And this is what the angel of God has
[1:54:08] spoken to John. You write to the angel
[1:54:12] of this church and say this. These
[1:54:15] things are sealed up, but he will reveal
[1:54:18] it to us.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; And you need to ask, "Oh God,
[1:54:25] I may not be worthy, but reveal it to
[1:54:28] me."
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; And after the agony of the of the death
[1:54:33] of Jesus
[1:54:35] and his resurrection,
[1:54:38] go back, put yourself there. the great
[1:54:40] apostles, whoever you think is the great
[1:54:42] apostles in this day. And the great
[1:54:45] leaders and the disciples of Christ,
[1:54:48] they were all locked up. They were their
[1:54:51] hearts were filled with fear. They're
[1:54:52] just men.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; They were discouraged. They were
[1:54:55] despondent. Their leader had just been
[1:54:57] killed. And the secretary treasurer of
[1:55:01] the church had just gone and committed
[1:55:03] suicide. It wasn't a place that was not
[1:55:06] a group of people you wanted to be
[1:55:08] connected with. But one thing for sure
[1:55:12] when that apostle John wrote, he said,
[1:55:15] "We know that we are of God."
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; That's what you have to know. I know
[1:55:21] that we are of God. There is no other
[1:55:23] message like this anywhere on earth.
[1:55:27] This is a message. And I'm not I'm not
[1:55:30] say all they're going this direction and
[1:55:33] the whole world is going into
[1:55:36] Sodom and whatever more.
[1:55:39] If you understand
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; and let it be a
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; clearer understanding to you when we
[1:55:48] talk about people going away from and it
[1:55:52] just Sodom and so on. What is it? It's
[1:55:56] man with man.
[1:56:01] It's overseed.
[1:56:04] When you talk about all the lesbianism
[1:56:07] or whatever is gripping or this
[1:56:10] transgender, whatever more, it's seed,
[1:56:13] seed, seed. That's what it's all about.
[1:56:17] And it's a great battle between God and
[1:56:20] righteous and Satan, his arc enemy in
[1:56:24] heaven. That's why he's been cast down
[1:56:26] here. And the prophet of God said, "It
[1:56:29] has fallen. This battle has fallen on
[1:56:32] the children of men. It has fallen onto
[1:56:35] us. And we we make certain decisions."
[1:56:39] Yes. But God has already
[1:56:42] has already spoken who I bless. I'm
[1:56:45] going to bless those that believe me.
[1:56:47] I'm going to bless them. And And there's
[1:56:50] no way that they can come out of the
[1:56:52] blessing. They're blessed. Amen.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. I say to you,
[1:56:56] young and old alike, parents alike,
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; hear me now,
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; be in a place of where God's blessing is
[1:57:04] flowing.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; That's all we need to do.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; And I just by God's grace, I that is my
[1:57:13] intent. That's my purpose. That's why I
[1:57:16] feel we've been predestinated. I can
[1:57:19] tell you one thing, friends. I can tell
[1:57:21] you one thing.
[1:57:23] the God
[1:57:25] that required me to come here. I did not
[1:57:29] come without
[1:57:31] some
[1:57:33] resistance.
[1:57:35] I thought, what's going to happen to my
[1:57:36] family? I don't have a profession. I
[1:57:38] don't have
[1:57:40] It was like I was jumping off a deep
[1:57:42] end.
[1:57:46] And great temptations came my way to me.
[1:57:49] They were not even temptations.
[1:57:54] And we came here. I know one thing. I
[1:57:58] have been called to this place.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; I know that.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; I know. And you people have been
[1:58:06] wonderful people. I want to thank you. I
[1:58:09] prayed for you. I prayed for you,
[1:58:11] Matthew. I prayed for you up in the
[1:58:13] balcony. I prayed for the deacons. I
[1:58:16] prayed for your trustees.
[1:58:19] And when the camera first came on you,
[1:58:21] Brother Wes Nyard, I prayed for you and
[1:58:24] your wife, Sister Diane. I don't know if
[1:58:27] that means anything, but I pray for you.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; I thank you.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you uphold this
[1:58:37] message,
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; this testimony in Jesus name. Amen. God
[1:58:42] bless you.
[1:58:55] God bless you.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; That's why we have fathers of the faith.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Direction, vision, burdened. It's
[1:59:06] powerful. And we received that this
[1:59:08] morning, brother Ed. We loved it. And we
[1:59:11] we see the hand of God in it. And as God
[1:59:14] directed him to speak this morning, our
[1:59:17] pastor, God had us here to hear what we
[1:59:20] needed to hear. Maybe we could all
[1:59:22] stand. Say, "He came to me." Let's just
[1:59:25] sing that.
[1:59:30] He came to me.
[1:59:36] He came
[1:59:38] to me.
[1:59:43] When I heard him come
[1:59:47] to where he was,
[1:59:50] he came
[1:59:52] to me.
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:57] That's why
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:10] I could come
[2:00:14] to where he was. He came to me. Let's
[2:00:20] just close our eyes and worship him.
[2:00:23] He came
[2:00:25] to me.
[2:00:30] He came
[2:00:37] and I could not
[2:00:41] to where he was.
[2:00:44] He came
[2:00:46] to me.
[2:00:49] [Music]
[2:00:50] That's why
[2:00:53] [Music]
[2:00:56] on
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:01:10] he
[2:01:15] I think more and more as time goes on we
[2:01:18] start to realize the impact of of what
[2:01:20] God's given us.
[2:01:23] We can look in the Old Testament and we
[2:01:25] can see that God was in a burning bush
[2:01:28] and Moses could sing this song this
[2:01:30] morning. He came to me. Or we could look
[2:01:33] at Gideon
[2:01:34] and an angel of the Lord was sitting
[2:01:36] right in the path. God knew exactly
[2:01:38] where Gideon was going to come and
[2:01:41] Gideon could sing the song, He came to
[2:01:44] me.
[2:01:45] And then we have a pastor, we have a man
[2:01:47] of God
[2:01:49] where God sent a prophet in this
[2:01:51] generation knowing exactly what was on
[2:01:53] his heart and what his desire and what
[2:01:56] his vision was can sit on the log and we
[2:01:59] could sing this with our pastor. He came
[2:02:01] to me. We can see it all throughout the
[2:02:04] scriptures. A woman at the well. We can
[2:02:06] just rejoice this morning because we've
[2:02:09] all here because Jesus Christ came to
[2:02:14] me. Let's just sing it before we have a
[2:02:16] word of prayer.
[2:02:18] He came
[2:02:21] to me predestinated
[2:02:24] of God. He came
[2:02:28] for know of our heavenly father.
[2:02:31] [Music]
[2:02:40] He gave
[2:02:42] to me
[2:02:46] and that's why he died
[2:02:52] on Cal
[2:02:59] when I
[2:03:05] us.
[2:03:07] He came to me.
[2:03:10] As
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; we bow our heads and close our eyes, I
[2:03:12] want you to think back to where the Holy
[2:03:15] Spirit interrupted your life and how you
[2:03:18] could say, "He indeed came my way."
[2:03:22] And now what we heard this morning has
[2:03:24] made it more alive, made it more real,
[2:03:28] made it more personal that we can say
[2:03:31] from the depths of my soul. I couldn't
[2:03:34] come to where he was, but the word of
[2:03:36] God came by my way. God opened my eyes
[2:03:42] to see his glory. And you want to
[2:03:45] worship him. You just want to lift up
[2:03:46] your voice. You want to thank him, Lord
[2:03:48] Jesus. Six billion people on the face of
[2:03:52] the earth.
[2:03:54] 6 billion people on the face of the
[2:03:57] earth. But God rich in mercy
[2:04:00] predestinated his word to come by your
[2:04:03] way so that you could rejoice in his
[2:04:06] presence and give him all the glory and
[2:04:09] honor. Lord, with our hands lifted up,
[2:04:12] with our voices lifted up, with our
[2:04:15] hearts lifted up in thanksgiving, Lord,
[2:04:18] for a word that we heard this morning,
[2:04:20] we have been chosen, elected by Almighty
[2:04:24] God himself.
[2:04:26] Lord, you laid out the plan so
[2:04:28] wonderfully this morning. We're thankful
[2:04:30] for a pastor that has a burden for his
[2:04:34] children. And Lord, we just pray that
[2:04:37] you'll be his strength and be his
[2:04:39] portion as we believe that Lord that you
[2:04:43] knew exactly
[2:04:45] what we had need of to hear this morning
[2:04:48] from the word of life. Would you
[2:04:50] strengthen him? Would you continue to
[2:04:53] revelate him? Lord, may we so learn to
[2:04:58] appreciate him so much more as these
[2:05:01] days go on. We're thankful for his life.
[2:05:05] We're thankful for his wife. We are
[2:05:07] thankful for the church of God that Lord
[2:05:10] that has come and has been been ordained
[2:05:13] of God. So, Father, we just want to
[2:05:16] thank you this morning for thus sayeth
[2:05:19] the Lord for a message that is true, for
[2:05:22] a people that are holding on. Lord,
[2:05:26] would you receive our thanksgiving this
[2:05:28] morning? And we thank you for your word
[2:05:31] in Jesus' name. In Jesus name. Lord I
[2:05:35] lift your name your holy name.
[2:05:41] Lord I lift
[2:05:45] your lift your name.
[2:05:50] Your holy
[2:05:53] name
[2:05:57] your holy
[2:06:00] God.
[2:06:02] I know him.
[2:06:08] You're the great
[2:06:11] I am
[2:06:15] the
[2:06:19] lamb.
[2:06:20] [Music]
[2:06:21] My father
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:26] and
[2:06:28] king
[2:06:32] and Lord I
[2:06:36] your name
[2:06:38] [Music]
[2:06:40] you're
[2:06:44] [Music]
[2:06:50] [Music]
[2:06:51] I am
[2:06:57] your
[2:06:58] [Music]
[2:07:19] Let's bow our heads as we prepare to
[2:07:21] leave. Father,
[2:07:23] you knew our names.
[2:07:27] Long before the foundation of the world,
[2:07:30] as your prophet taught us, Lord, we were
[2:07:32] in the thoughts of God beyond the eons
[2:07:35] of time.
[2:07:37] And we've been privileged, Lord, to be
[2:07:39] living in this hour that we could
[2:07:41] proclaim the Lord Jesus Christ is alive
[2:07:45] and well.
[2:07:47] And so, Lord Jesus, as we see the the
[2:07:50] blending of time into eternity, may we
[2:07:54] press the battle like we've never
[2:07:56] pressed it before. May young men raise
[2:08:00] up, Lord, proclaiming this gospel as
[2:08:04] true. The world is in their confusion.
[2:08:09] But God, you send a message, Lord, to
[2:08:12] give us clear direction and
[2:08:14] understanding and the very mind of God.
[2:08:18] So Lord, this evening as brother Tim
[2:08:20] will minister myself down in Seattle, we
[2:08:23] just pray God that your grace will be
[2:08:26] upon us that we would not speak words of
[2:08:28] man, but we would speak words of life.
[2:08:32] Bless your children as they go their
[2:08:34] separate way. give them a wonderful
[2:08:36] afternoon and may you be glorified
[2:08:39] through our lives. We ask in Jesus'
[2:08:42] name. Amen. Amen. One last song before
[2:08:47] we go and shake one another's hand. He
[2:08:49] knows my name. He knows your name.
[2:08:56] I have
[2:08:58] a maker
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:03] and all my heart
[2:09:10] and
[2:09:11] even think about it.
[2:09:15] My life was that should give you a great
[2:09:18] rest this morning.
[2:09:23] He knows my name
[2:09:27] [Music]
[2:09:29] and he knows my every
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:43] me.
[2:09:48] [Music]
[2:09:50] I have a father.
[2:09:56] He calls me
[2:09:59] [Music]
[2:10:03] and he'll never
[2:10:05] leave me.
[2:10:08] No matter where I go.
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:16] Oh, he knows my name.
[2:10:22] And he knows my everywhere.
[2:10:28] [Music]
[2:10:37] He knows he knows my name. One more
[2:10:40] time.
[2:10:42] He knows my name
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:48] and he knows my every
[2:10:54] [Music]
[2:11:02] me.
[2:11:05] [Music]
[2:11:07] Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed in
[2:11:11] Jesus name. And may the Lord be with you
[2:11:13] this afternoon. Till we see you again,
[2:11:16] God bless you.
[2:11:22] [Music]
