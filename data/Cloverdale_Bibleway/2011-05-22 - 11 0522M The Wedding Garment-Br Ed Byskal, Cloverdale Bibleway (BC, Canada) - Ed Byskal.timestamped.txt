[9:51] And the church said,
[9:53] &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; The original life will produce another
[9:58] original life."
[10:00] &gt;&gt; And if you have a different life, you
[10:01] just haven't found that life. When you
[10:03] find it, it'll be just like your brother
[10:05] and sister.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that. The other night,
[10:08] Brother Tom said,
[10:11] "What's your measuring line compared to
[10:14] what?" Compared to the word compared to
[10:17] that life. That's the life I want.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you each one this

[10:25] to hear you clap your hands. See the

[10:32] have brother Tom just come and take us
[10:34] to the Lord in prayer. We've got a
[10:35] special this morning. Started a little
[10:38] bit late, but that's good because we can
[10:40] go the rest of the day. Our pastor is
[10:42] just going to come and we're going to
[10:43] relax and pull on the gift of God that's
[10:45] in the man this morning. Amen. We've got
[10:48] one service next Sunday at 11:00 as
[10:50] well. Got young peoples this coming
[10:54] Friday evening here at the church. How
[10:57] many enjoyed that we're able to go down
[10:58] to Seattle Friday night and participate
[11:01] in the young people's meeting down
[11:02] there? Praise the Lord. Wonderful
[11:05] opportunity that we each one have to
[11:07] play our part. Amen. We did have a
[11:10] testimony from the Esther Housen family.
[11:13] We asked for prayer for Sister Marie in
[11:15] South Africa with stage 4 brain and lung
[11:19] cancer a while back. She has now been
[11:21] declared cancer free. Many are the
[11:24] affliction to the righteous, but the
[11:26] Lord deliverth from them all.
[11:29] Hallelujah.
[11:35] Praise the Lord.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; He's alive, isn't he?
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's rejoice in his goodness this
[11:40] morning as we join our hearts together.
[11:43] Amen. Lord, you're a living God.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; We rejoice this morning in the power of
[11:48] your resurrection. Lord, that we can be
[11:51] identified, Lord God, with the unveiling
[11:53] of your word. That we do not look to a
[11:56] Jesus that is of history, but we believe
[11:58] that there is a God today, Lord, that is
[12:02] living, not just living in our minds,
[12:04] but living in our hearts, living in our
[12:06] lives, living in us to tell. And Father,
[12:09] we've been rejoicing in the testimonies
[12:11] of God this last week and months. We can
[12:14] say because
[12:16] you live,
[12:17] &gt;&gt; we live also. And we rejoice, Lord, in
[12:20] this sister's testimony that you're
[12:23] alive and living in a people again.
[12:26] Lord, we're just so thankful that we
[12:28] have gathered this morning. We pray,
[12:30] God, that every need in divine presence
[12:32] will be met. For at the preaching of
[12:34] your word, the children of the Lord are
[12:37] healed. Heal your people by the word of
[12:40] God, we pray. Anoint brother Ed, anoint
[12:43] our ears to hear as we rejoice around
[12:46] the body, word of the son of man. Feed
[12:48] us from your table. Anoint us to
[12:51] believe. And let us rejoice this morning
[12:53] that you're a living God. Living Lord
[12:56] amongst the children
[12:59] of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[13:02] That we can say, Lord God, not by a
[13:04] same, but we know that you are here and
[13:07] present to meet all our needs. We
[13:09] rejoice now and give you thanks in Jesus
[13:12] name. Amen.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Why
[13:18] don't you turn and shake hands with
[13:19] somebody near you? Might be a stranger,
[13:22] might be your dearest friend, relative.
[13:25] Say, "God bless you."
[13:28] Amen. You may have your seats. We've got
[13:31] a special for you this morning. So, if
[13:33] they can come and get ready.
[13:35] Did have a couple of quick
[13:36] announcements.
[13:39] Everybody remember next Sunday's service
[13:41] will be at 11:00.
[13:44] Just one service. There's a grad meeting
[13:47] following the service today for all

[14:44] [Music]
[14:46] There's never been a better time for us
[14:50] to find out all the truth for our age,
[14:57] where we are.
[15:01] Cuz there's so many who depend on what
[15:05] he's done or what he'll do.
[15:09] I want to know what God is doing now.
[15:16] Not I was, not I will be, but I am
[15:23] to what God's promise for today. I'll
[15:27] save it
[15:31] cuz he's a living God and has a present
[15:35] plan.
[15:38] Cuz he's not I was not I will be but I
[15:43] am.
[15:49] [Music]
[15:53] I love to think about the future home of
[15:58] the earthly bride. But as for now,
[16:03] what did he say?
[16:08] And I can't live on some old man from
[16:11] all the ages that's gone by. I've got to
[16:16] know what God has promised for today.
[16:22] Not I was not I will be but I am
[16:29] to what God for today I'll say
[16:37] cuz he's a living God and has a presence
[16:44] he's not
[16:46] I will be but I am
[16:51] not I was that I will be what I am
[16:58] to God's for today.
[17:06] Cuz he's the living God and has a plan.
[17:12] Cuz he's not I was not I will be but I
[17:17] am.
[17:20] He's not I was not I will be but I am.
[17:27] I said he's not I was not I will be but
[17:31] I am.
[17:37] [Music]
[17:38] [Applause]
[17:46] &gt;&gt; I think they could almost sing that
[17:48] again.
[17:50] Amen. You catch the first line and then
[17:52] it's you almost feel like it got over
[17:54] with too quick.

[17:59] me Lord, I'll follow. Lead me Lord, I'll

[27:22] Brother
[27:25] Brother Ivan, Sister Assassin arrived in
[27:28] China.
[27:29] And we have a little picture of uh
[27:32] Brother Ivan.
[27:35] Uh there we have it.
[27:38] And uh he said
[27:41] uh that they saw God's hand just full
[27:45] completely on this whole trip. Even to
[27:48] the even to the lineups. How many people
[27:51] know what lineups are?
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. But you know what God did
[27:56] for them? He said they had no lineups.
[27:58] There were lineups were there and
[28:00] somehow they said everybody the
[28:02] authorities always took them around and
[28:03] put them in a special lineup where there
[28:05] was no lineup. and they they got such
[28:08] special treatment. They said it started
[28:09] right here at the airport in Vancouver
[28:13] and uh they weren't uh standing in line
[28:15] waiting. Uh they asked us to come in a
[28:20] special route and all the security gates
[28:23] and customs and everything he said and
[28:25] all many little things that happened.
[28:27] But he said as soon as we arrived in
[28:29] Sanhen, brother Elvie didn't give me
[28:32] even one day to rest. and he shared at
[28:36] the new church and and then the
[28:38] questions and answers period afterward
[28:41] and they had a meeting on Friday and
[28:43] then the next day they're at another
[28:45] church on Sunday and of course questions
[28:47] and answers said brother Murphy knows
[28:49] that what that's all about because when
[28:52] church is over in China church isn't
[28:54] over
[28:56] it just just goes into another phase and
[29:00] then after questions and answers it's
[29:02] time for fellowship
[29:04] He said, "God is doing great things. The
[29:07] spirit of God is doing great things here
[29:10] in China and stirring this nation for
[29:13] more to come and maturing the older
[29:16] believers."
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the way it
[29:19] should be.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:22] And he says, "We didn't miss any of the
[29:24] service of Cloverdale from Cloverdale,
[29:27] but we did miss all of you, your smiling
[29:31] faces and presence, and I'm glad they do
[29:34] miss that."
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless brother Ivan and Sister
[29:39] Asenth. I suppose most of you knew
[29:42] sister Aston's mother was very very ill
[29:44] with cancer
[29:46] and uh in fact is very ill
[29:50] and they that's their first line
[29:53] that we are with AST's mom
[29:57] her name is Deborah
[29:59] and she's doing a way better now he told
[30:02] me in another email that the blood count
[30:07] which was down very low is going up and
[30:10] our cancer cells are going down.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to lift our voice.
[30:18] Praise the Lord.
[30:24] Amen.

[30:36] Lassard's sister Amber is here.

[30:45] Upstairs. Oh my. Well, God bless you.
[30:49] Nice to have you in service this
[30:51] morning. Amen.
[30:56] We want to read out of Genesis the 24th
[30:59] chapter.
[31:01] Before

[31:16] with me in prayer.
[31:22] How great and how wonderful you are,
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[31:28] and that we can come to you father
[31:32] as your children.
[31:34] We have many needs needs here locally.
[31:38] There are other needs in the bride body
[31:41] of Jesus Christ.
[31:43] Needs oh God wherever they may be. We
[31:47] are so thankful for what you are doing
[31:51] in the great nation of China. It's hard
[31:54] for us to imagine the population that is
[31:57] there that have not had opportunity to
[32:00] hear your voice, your prophet's voice.
[32:05] But oh God, as the brethren are striving
[32:08] and laboring and giving themselves both
[32:11] night and day, traveling many, many
[32:14] miles,
[32:16] oh God, giving of their energy and of
[32:19] their resources, and we are doing all
[32:21] that we can to support them. We want to
[32:25] support them now in prayer. May the Holy
[32:28] Spirit be with brother Ivan, Sister
[32:31] Asenath. I pray the Holy Spirit be with
[32:34] every one of the ministers, Lord, that
[32:36] are there carrying your message and all
[32:39] the new believers that have gathered. Oh
[32:43] God. Oh God. Yeah. I know that it's
[32:46] right for us to pray that there be a
[32:48] mighty sweep, a wave. Not only what's
[32:51] happening there, but let it be in other
[32:53] countries as well, Lord, around the
[32:55] world. Whether it be in Africa or Asia,
[32:58] whether it be oh God in here in America,
[33:02] we need we need the leadership of the
[33:05] Holy Spirit. And Father, I pray that as
[33:08] the word lays before us and as I look
[33:11] upon the page and read these words,
[33:14] Lord, I pray that the Holy Spirit will
[33:16] energize this vessel and may the uh
[33:20] speaker and uh hearers alike be
[33:23] anointed. Oh God, may we be surrendered,
[33:26] ready to hear, ready to act, ready to
[33:29] obey. And we say, "Here am I, oh Lord. I
[33:33] pray that you'll speak, oh God, to us.
[33:36] Give us your word. May your spirit of
[33:38] revelation fall upon this congregation,
[33:42] upon all who hear, Lord, the divine Holy
[33:45] Spirit of revelation. Reveal your word.
[33:48] May it not just be some word spoken. May
[33:50] it not be some message or sermon, oh
[33:53] God, but may it be a divine voice. Speak
[33:56] to the souls of our souls individually.
[34:00] And Father, I pray that you'll be
[34:02] praised and glorified. Thank you for the
[34:04] healing touch, Lord. For Sister
[34:07] Asenath's mother, oh God, let her be
[34:10] restored to good health again. Thank
[34:12] you, Father, for what you're doing in in
[34:14] our own congregation and those that
[34:16] you've touched and healed. I just give
[34:18] you praise and glory. Hallelujah.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. Amen.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; You have to excuse me. I just want to I
[34:32] just want to keep praising him.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's been so good, so
[34:37] gracious.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; All right. We start to read at the 48th
[34:43] verse of Genesis 24.
[34:45] And we're breaking into the account of
[34:48] Eleazar
[34:50] uh going to find Rebecca, a bride for
[34:54] Isaac,
[34:56] which we know is uh means a great deal
[34:59] to us
[35:02] and Eleaser speaking. And I bowed down
[35:05] my head and worshiped the Lord, and
[35:08] blessed the Lord God of my master
[35:10] Abraham,
[35:11] which had led me to the right way to
[35:14] take my master's brother's daughter unto
[35:17] his son.
[35:19] And now, if you will deal kindly and
[35:22] truly with my master, tell me. and if
[35:26] not, tell me that I may turn to the
[35:29] right hand
[35:31] uh or the or or to the left. Then Laban
[35:36] and Bethuel
[35:37] answered and said, "The thing for
[35:40] proceedth from the Lord, we cannot speak
[35:42] unto thee, bad or good. Behold, Rebecca
[35:46] is before thee. Take her and go, and let
[35:49] her be thy master's son's wife, as the
[35:53] Lord hath spoken." And it came to pass
[35:57] that when Abraham's servant heard the
[36:00] their words, he worshiped the Lord,
[36:02] bowing himself to the earth.
[36:07] And he and the servant brought forth
[36:11] jewels of silver and jewels of gold and
[36:15] raignment, and gave them to Rebecca. And
[36:20] he gave also to her brother and to her
[36:23] mother precious things.
[36:26] I want to read then a second reading in
[36:29] Revelation the 19th chapter. Two verses
[36:34] verses n 7 and 8 of chapter 19 of
[36:38] revelation.
[36:50] Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[36:53] honor to him. For the marriage of the
[36:56] Lamb is come, and his wife hath made
[36:59] herself ready.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; And to her was granted that she should
[37:04] be arrayed in fine linen,
[37:07] clean and white. For the fine linen is
[37:11] the righteousness of the saints. and to
[37:15] her was granted that she should be
[37:18] arrayed in fine linen,
[37:21] clean and white. For the fine linen is
[37:25] the righteousness of the saints. God
[37:27] bless you. Thank you for standing.
[37:31] And I'll thank you in advance for your
[37:34] real keen attention this morning
[37:37] because we need uh to have a real focus
[37:41] during the service.
[37:47] The Lord has been gracious to us and the
[37:49] to myself at least I can only speak for
[37:52] myself as a minister
[37:55] as I have been reading the word and
[37:58] reading the message. It's just like
[38:03] places or things that you should have
[38:05] thought of
[38:07] but they haven't come to your mind. It's
[38:11] just like God is opening up areas that
[38:15] you didn't see before.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; And that is something that may not be
[38:19] something for some of you that are
[38:21] younger or uh newer in the message, but
[38:25] when you have spent a lot of years and
[38:27] spent a lot of time and then you find
[38:30] out you have to confess there is no
[38:33] limit.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; This is eternal word.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; This is this just continues to open up.
[38:40] in new ways.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; And sometimes I have to stop.
[38:45] I actually stop and say, "Lord, is is
[38:48] this you?
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Am I seeing what I'm seeing?" Amen.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; And you have to think about it
[38:54] prayerfully.
[38:56] And that's what some of the things that
[38:59] we have thought in fact is last night
[39:02] I'm I'm reading and just uh actually
[39:05] went to bed and was reading and
[39:07] listening some more and then it was just
[39:10] like something began to speak to me and
[39:12] I grabbed a pad and and wrote for about
[39:15] three pages just line by line by line by
[39:18] line. And that's something I really have
[39:20] to think about and uh Lord willing we'll
[39:23] minister it here in the in the near
[39:25] future. But I want to speak to on the
[39:29] wedding garment.
[39:33] I with God's help
[39:36] uh I believe that you also will see uh
[39:41] see it perhaps a little differently.
[39:44] You know, we're as humans, we're so tied
[39:47] to things that are physical
[39:50] &gt;&gt; and uh we see the wedding garment, but
[39:52] this wedding garment isn't like any
[39:54] wedding garment you've ever seen.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Uh in fact is I want to make a
[40:00] statement. You are being clothed with
[40:03] this wedding garment even now.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; You're literally being clothed by that
[40:10] garment. Amen.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Uh we will speak of things that perhaps
[40:17] refer to things that are not physical
[40:20] such as being clothed in humility,
[40:23] being clothed in righteousness,
[40:26] being clothed in revelation.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Tell that's a wonderful garment.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; And someone who's not clothed in
[40:37] revelation is actually going to end up
[40:39] naked.
[40:45] clothed in wisdom and clothed in dignity
[40:50] and clothed in purity and holiness.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Think of those things as we move along.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:57] When we think of being clothed
[41:02] in uh
[41:04] or being arrayed,
[41:07] uh most often we think in terms of
[41:09] something of a physical nature.
[41:12] Uh I just wonder in all honesty this
[41:15] morning, how many went into their closet
[41:17] or how many got up this morning and
[41:19] said, "What will I wear?"
[41:26] I checked on, you know, what what suit
[41:28] will I wear? I don't have that many, but
[41:31] I thought, which one will I wear? I
[41:34] checked one out and it wasn't quite. So,
[41:36] I just Okay, here we are. Most everybody
[41:40] because you you also you dress for the
[41:43] Okay, it's amazing how important that
[41:45] is.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; You know, is is everything just right?
[41:51] You know, does it does it match?
[41:57] Some of you men, you don't know whether
[41:58] it matches or you don't care whether it
[42:00] matches. And that's probably good.
[42:03] But you know, if you're dressing for
[42:06] you're dressing for the occasion, you
[42:08] dress for the day when you get up in the
[42:09] morning, you're just going to go to work
[42:11] and you just put on your grubs. or you
[42:14] say, "Well, no, I have to I have to meet
[42:16] someone today or I have to go out
[42:19] and uh you know, I don't want to say
[42:22] private things, but uh you know, I I get
[42:25] into the car or I'm going to go to the
[42:27] car and let's let's go out and she
[42:30] she'll check me out." She says, "We're
[42:32] not stopping any place, are we?"
[42:38] You know what that's all about? You're
[42:40] smiling and laughing because that's
[42:41] that's you. you you get there, too.
[42:44] We're not going to go to a restaurant,
[42:46] are we? Well, I don't know. We might if
[42:48] we get hungry. Might go to the Well,
[42:50] then I have to change. That that's just
[42:52] standard procedure.
[42:55] Uh, usually we dress for what we expect
[42:58] to be doing that day. There's a regular
[43:00] day, there's the home, there's the
[43:02] office, there's a meeting, there's a
[43:04] maybe a doctor's appointment, then we
[43:07] dress differently for a graduation.
[43:10] And uh some of the young people are
[43:12] thinking about graduation right now and
[43:14] uh and and and so they think about how
[43:17] they're going to dress for that
[43:18] occasion.
[43:19] Uh there are
[43:22] dress codes as well. Uh we have some
[43:26] young people who want to come from
[43:27] overseas and attend the school. And the
[43:30] school uh the brother the brother TCA's
[43:35] the principal and his wife sister
[43:37] Shelley. Uh that was one of the first
[43:40] concerns. These people need to know that
[43:43] it's not a dress code, but it is
[43:46] according to the scripture. There are
[43:48] some dress requirements and some things
[43:50] that are not permitted and not allowed
[43:53] and other things that are are expected.
[43:56] But then you you may prepare for
[43:59] something special.
[44:01] Dressing for a special occasion.
[44:05] Uh and a wedding of course is one of
[44:07] those special occasions when people
[44:10] usually a bride
[44:13] is assisted by someone and maybe her
[44:16] bride's made but they're assisted and
[44:19] they're essentially dressed by someone
[44:22] else. And then when you get into royalty
[44:25] there's royalty.
[44:27] We just had a a wedding was supposed to
[44:30] be the wedding of you know of the
[44:32] century or whatever more to me. I have
[44:35] to just be honest with you. I don't uh
[44:38] for a couple and a a young man, a young
[44:40] woman, royalty, and they've been living
[44:42] together for years and now they're going
[44:44] to get married and make a big halaloo
[44:47] for the whole world to see and all the
[44:49] rest. But I think that the fact they've
[44:51] been living together for years and now
[44:53] they're going to go and get married,
[44:54] that's is a disgrace. That's debauchery.
[44:58] And they're elevating it up. But you you
[45:00] you know I I I did see some of it on the
[45:03] computer and and uh it was on there for
[45:07] days and and you think of all the braid
[45:11] and the gold and the metals and the
[45:14] ribbons and how everything had to be
[45:16] just precisely precisely. I can tell you
[45:19] that it cost millions and millions and
[45:23] millions of dollars to put on that kind
[45:25] of thing. And the people they you know
[45:27] they they they got dressed and they got
[45:30] arrayed and they got uh in in this just
[45:34] pompous
[45:35] celebration.
[45:37] But I want to say to this humble
[45:39] congregation today that that doesn't
[45:42] even stand
[45:44] that's not even kindergarten stuff to
[45:47] what the bride of Jesus Christ
[45:50] &gt;&gt; is going to appear. Let me tell you
[45:52] friends
[45:53] &gt;&gt; and remember it when you stand and watch
[45:56] the bride of Jesus Christ of which you
[45:59] will be a part start to come through. If
[46:02] these doors flew open now and they start
[46:06] coming from Africa start coming from
[46:09] Europe and all the national dress and
[46:12] begin to walk in here singing only
[46:14] believe or something there wouldn't be a
[46:16] dry eye.
[46:18] there wouldn't be anybody that wouldn't
[46:20] be moved. And you see them come out of
[46:21] their hardship and see them come out of
[46:23] Siberia, see them come out of the north
[46:26] and see them come out of the south.
[46:28] There wouldn't be anybody here that
[46:31] would not be watching these doors as the
[46:33] bride started walking in. You would
[46:36] clap, you'd shout, you'd cry, you'd do
[46:39] everything because it's it'd be the
[46:41] beauty.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It'd be people who've been
[46:45] cultivated by a certain word. Yeah.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And of all the peoples that have
[46:49] gathered and are sitting in pews exactly
[46:51] like you, there are very very few that
[46:53] have gathered around a vindicated
[46:56] &gt;&gt; don't don't forget it. A vindicated
[46:59] message. You know that this God that set
[47:01] the whole universe in place and set all
[47:04] the planets and the galaxies and
[47:06] billions and billions of them. I can't
[47:08] even imagine that kind of a God. But
[47:10] that God stood by a servant here on
[47:13] earth because of a voice, because of a
[47:16] word that was being spoken because he
[47:18] could say with authority, "Thus saith
[47:21] the Lord."
[47:23] &gt;&gt; And because that could happen, because
[47:25] that took place, I can tell you that
[47:28] kind of God will never leave that word.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Never will leave that word.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Yeah,
[47:38] &gt;&gt; you're standing on good ground.
[47:40] And it's that word that I'm speaking of
[47:43] this morning. The vindication to me is
[47:45] is uh uh more than just uh just a
[47:49] phrase.
[47:51] Garments often identify a person's
[47:55] office or their rank or their position.
[48:00] It will it can identify their profession
[48:03] or their degree of royalty.
[48:07] also dress starts to and and this is
[48:10] where we're turning a corner now a
[48:12] little bit. It says that
[48:16] she was that she should be arrayed in
[48:20] fine linen. Yes, sir.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; And the word array or if you said array
[48:26] aren also is a very military word. There
[48:31] was an array
[48:33] of of of military men. And a array
[48:38] refers to an order. How it how things
[48:41] are ordered, how the arrangement of
[48:44] them. This bride is not some patchwork.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; And the bride's garment isn't a patch
[48:51] quilt. It's not just a piece of this and
[48:54] a little bit of man's idea and a little
[48:56] bit of my past tradition, a little bit
[48:58] of my forefather's thoughts and what I
[49:01] think is right. God doesn't think
[49:03] doesn't care what you think.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; He has sent his thought down. He's
[49:08] vindicated his thought and you're being
[49:10] dressed by his thought. This is what he
[49:13] thinks the the garment should look like.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; So, a uniform is more than a dress.
[49:21] A uniform also is protective.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; The military dresses in a certain way
[49:29] and in their dress and in their uniform
[49:32] they also have protection.
[49:34] Uh the the police force, the firemen,
[49:38] all these different uh areas and
[49:41] arrangements, but dress is incredibly
[49:44] important. And the bride's dress
[49:49] is something
[49:51] uh that that involves protection.
[49:56] God dressed
[49:58] a couple people.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; The first ones.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; And it might not sound very glamorous to
[50:08] you, and I don't know where he got them,
[50:11] but they were bloody skins. And the
[50:14] prophet said that as they walked out of
[50:17] the garden, those hides and skins were
[50:20] slapping against the manly legs of Adam.
[50:25] And he said they could cry now as the
[50:29] first time they could shed tears now.
[50:32] And she put her head over on his
[50:34] shoulder as they were being
[50:36] excommunicated out of the garden. and
[50:40] and and and with the blood trickling
[50:42] from those hides down their bodies. But
[50:45] that was the best dress in the world.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; That was the best dress in the universe
[50:51] &gt;&gt; because that dress was something that
[50:54] was making a statement. You say, "Well,
[50:56] the way a person dresses makes a
[50:58] statement." That was making a statement.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; That made a statement that my sin, this
[51:04] fall, God's got an answer for this fall.
[51:08] Hallelujah. And God was the only one who
[51:11] knew how to dress them.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; And God's the only one who knows how to
[51:16] dress you
[51:17] &gt;&gt; and get you out of this world.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; He's the only one who knows how to dress
[51:22] you in Satan's Eden.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; He's the only one who knows what's
[51:27] required.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you what's required. A
[51:30] bleeding word.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; A message that's hated.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; A message that's been crucified.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for the second crucifixion.
[51:39] A world that's been indicted for the
[51:41] second crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; And God has provided a garment.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Adam,
[51:53] he fixed his own garment.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; And he fixed her own garment and they
[51:59] swed it.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; It didn't call for some sewing and some
[52:04] skill. It called for death.
[52:06] It called for a penalty. It called for
[52:09] somebody to suffer, something to suffer.
[52:12] And unto Adam and to his wife did the
[52:15] Lord God make coats of and of skins and
[52:19] clothed them.
[52:22] Didn't He didn't throw them there and
[52:24] say, "Here, put them on."
[52:26] He clothed them. Amen.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Garments can send a message.
[52:39] The Bible tells us
[52:42] of Judah's daughter-in-law, Tamar. I'm
[52:46] not going to speak much on it at all,
[52:48] but in Genesis 38:14,
[52:51] when she was refused, the youngest son
[52:55] is a husband. Her husband had died and
[53:00] the her brother who was supposed to
[53:01] raise up seed to him spilled his seed on
[53:04] the ground and God slew him. and she was
[53:08] promised the youngest son who was not of
[53:10] age apparently yet and uh the h and
[53:14] Judah didn't give him and told her to
[53:18] put on her garments of widowhood
[53:21] and go back home
[53:24] and so now she puts on her garments of
[53:26] widowhood
[53:27] that's one way of dress and when she
[53:30] heard that her father-in-law who did not
[53:32] keep his word Judah one of the
[53:34] patriarchs was up in the mountain with
[53:36] his friends shearing shape and was going
[53:39] that direction. She put on her garment.
[53:42] She put on a garment of a harlot
[53:46] and he was able to tell the difference.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; She didn't have a garment of widowhood
[53:52] on beside the path. She put on a garment
[53:54] of prostitution as a harlot. And he saw
[53:58] her and went in unto her and brought
[54:02] forth
[54:03] a child.
[54:05] It says, "And she put on and she put her
[54:10] widow's garments off from her
[54:14] and covered herself with a veil and
[54:16] wrapped herself and sat in an open place
[54:19] which is by the way of Timnath
[54:23] and she saw for she saw that Sheila that
[54:27] was the youngest was grown and she was
[54:29] not given unto him for wife. And when
[54:32] Judah saw her, he thought her to be in
[54:34] harlot because she had covered her face.
[54:39] And so that's that's that's account
[54:43] in the scripture. It tells us that the
[54:45] priests they had certain kind of
[54:48] garments. And these are the garments
[54:50] which they shall make. A breastplate and
[54:53] an aphod and a robe and embroider
[54:56] embroidered coat, a miter and a girdle.
[55:00] and they shall make holy garments for
[55:03] Aaron thy brother and his sons and he
[55:07] may that he may minister unto me in the
[55:09] priest's office that required a certain
[55:12] garment and it was told specifically how
[55:15] that garment should be made and the
[55:16] colors that would be used and so on and
[55:19] the scripture says that he may because
[55:22] he could not minister in that priest's
[55:25] office so he had to have a certain
[55:27] garment for a certain office I want you
[55:30] to tie the two together as we move
[55:32] through the the the the message today.
[55:36] The Bible speaks of David. Now we come
[55:39] to royalty. And David was clothed with
[55:42] the robe of fine linen. Now this is
[55:44] Bible.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said you you must see
[55:48] Christ in every verse.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; We're speaking about Christ. We're
[55:52] speaking about believers. We're speaking
[55:54] about God's plan, God's program. We're
[55:57] not just tell this is not just some idle
[56:00] sermon that we're speaking about this
[56:02] morning. You're not going to you're not
[56:04] going to go to where you hope to go
[56:06] unless you're dressed in the right
[56:08] garment.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; And David was clothed with a robe of
[56:14] fine linen. The Bible tells us, "And
[56:17] Herod with his men of war set him at
[56:21] not." Jesus that was set him at not and
[56:25] mocked him. And part of this whole
[56:28] crucifixion scene was that they arrayed
[56:32] him in a gorgeous robe and sent him
[56:37] again to Pilate. That was all part of
[56:40] the program. That was in this case, it
[56:42] was part of the mockery.
[56:46] to put him in a gorgeous robe and send
[56:49] him to Pilate.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; So to array is to clothe
[56:56] to be attired.
[56:59] But the word array also and catch this
[57:02] now because it will it's a it's a major
[57:05] shift in the service. It is to prepare
[57:08] or to equip. And when you think of being
[57:10] prepared or equipped,
[57:13] we think now in the sense of military or
[57:16] protection,
[57:18] this wedding garment
[57:21] that we are being clothed in and you
[57:24] need it desperately
[57:26] &gt;&gt; is a garment of protection.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; God is the only one who knows what we
[57:33] need
[57:34] &gt;&gt; because he's the only one who knows the
[57:37] tactic of the enemy. Amen.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; There are many other references
[57:44] regarding being clothed that do not
[57:46] refer to the physical. I just read them
[57:48] quickly. Jesus said, "Consider the liies
[57:51] of the field. They grow, they toil not,
[57:55] they spin not." And yet I say unto you
[57:57] that Solomon in all of his glory was not
[58:01] a raid like one of these. Right.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; David said in the Psalms, "Let mine
[58:08] adversaries be clothed with shame
[58:12] &gt;&gt; and let them cover themselves with their
[58:14] own confusion
[58:17] as with a mantle."
[58:19] Ezekiel it says part part of the verse
[58:22] all thine army horses and horsemen all
[58:26] of them clothed with all sorts of armor
[58:31] even a great company with bucklers and
[58:34] shields all of them handling swords all
[58:38] of that equipment and that has that has
[58:41] to do with being clothed that was part
[58:44] it's not just this but it is part of the
[58:47] array that they have as part of their
[58:51] office. They're in the military. All of
[58:54] your army, they're equipped. I want to
[58:57] say to this army of the Lord Jesus
[59:00] Christ, soldiers of Christ, standing at
[59:03] the post of duty, you have a sword.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; You have a helmet. You have a shield.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; You have footwear.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have exactly what you
[59:14] need for this for this generation. Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; You have exactly what you need. Maybe
[59:20] you came through a tough week. Let me
[59:22] tell you, you have equipment.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; You've been equipped.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; You see the guards at the border, they
[59:30] got bulletproof vests. We got a vest. We
[59:33] got a shield that the darts of the enemy
[59:35] cannot penetrate.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing can penetrate it.
[59:40] [Music]
[59:44] In Esther, in the book of Esther, it
[59:46] speaks of those that were clothed with
[59:49] sackcloth.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; They clothed with humility and sackcloth
[59:54] because they were calling on God. In
[59:57] Psalms, it tells us, "Let the priests be
[59:59] clothed with righteousness," and that's
[1:00:02] a very important one, which we'll speak
[1:00:04] on just a little further. And let their
[1:00:06] saints shout for joy. And then in
[1:00:09] Revelation,
[1:00:11] we have three scriptures. And I saw
[1:00:13] another mighty angel come down from
[1:00:15] heaven clothed with a cloud.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And in Revelation 7 and9, there was a
[1:00:24] group that were clothed with robes,
[1:00:27] white robes. And in Revelation 12 and 1,
[1:00:32] and there appeared a great wonder in the
[1:00:34] heaven, a woman clothed with the sun. In
[1:00:38] Revelation, this is the fourth one. And
[1:00:41] he was clothed with a vesture, speaking
[1:00:43] of Christ, a vesture dipped in blood,
[1:00:47] and his name is called the Word of God.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; In Revelation 7 and 13, and one of the
[1:00:54] elders answered, saying unto me, What
[1:00:57] are these this great host of people?
[1:00:59] What are these which are arrayed in
[1:01:01] white robes? And whence came they
[1:01:06] 17 and 14 and the woman was arrayed in
[1:01:09] purple and scarlet color and decked with
[1:01:12] gold and precious stones and pearls
[1:01:15] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[1:01:19] abominations and filthiness of her
[1:01:21] fornication. And so the the harlot, the
[1:01:25] great harlot also is decked out
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; and she is has a garment of scarlet and
[1:01:32] royalty which was a and and she's been
[1:01:35] set up on the on the in the minds of the
[1:01:39] people and in the eyes of the
[1:01:41] population. And you're living in this
[1:01:43] day.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; You're not you're not separated from it.
[1:01:46] This is part of your scene.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] In the preview of the bride,
[1:01:58] you that are sitting here and claimed to
[1:02:00] be followers of the message,
[1:02:04] your prophet
[1:02:06] saw
[1:02:07] the bride.
[1:02:10] And in the preview of the bride, he
[1:02:12] said, "I looked this way."
[1:02:15] And he said, "The bride will come into
[1:02:17] view for preview." And I looked coming
[1:02:19] to me and I seen the most prettiest
[1:02:21] bunch of clean
[1:02:24] dressed women. I'd like you to notice in
[1:02:27] this account how the dress,
[1:02:30] and I'm not talking about the physical
[1:02:31] dress now. I'm talking about what they
[1:02:33] were dressed with
[1:02:35] to be cleanressed women.
[1:02:38] These were individuals
[1:02:40] who heard,
[1:02:42] who heard the word,
[1:02:45] who obeyed the word,
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; who adhered to the word and loved the
[1:02:49] word
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; because that's the thing they were
[1:02:52] dressed with.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; There's nothing else can make you clean,
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; whiter than snow, than the blood of the
[1:02:58] lamb.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're washed in the blood
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. And she was clean
[1:03:05] dressed women I've ever seen in my life.
[1:03:07] But each one of them looked like they
[1:03:09] was dressed different. And they all had
[1:03:12] long hair and they were longer sleeves
[1:03:16] and skirts and so forth. Young women,
[1:03:19] they kind of looked to be about 20.
[1:03:22] And then he showed me the church. I'm
[1:03:24] not paraphrasing, but I have just
[1:03:27] selected certain portions of these
[1:03:30] paragraphs
[1:03:32] as they come up out of the ages. And oh,
[1:03:35] how vulgar. And the last one uh was this
[1:03:39] last church age which was led by a
[1:03:42] witch. And they were so immorally
[1:03:45] dressed, so filthy looking. And they
[1:03:49] were marching to the time of twist and
[1:03:51] rock and roll. And those women throwing
[1:03:54] themselves just in twist withholding
[1:03:57] just a paper gray hypocritical and gray
[1:04:01] looking paper holding in front of them.
[1:04:04] uh with which which laced like hoola
[1:04:07] skirts uh holding in front of them and
[1:04:10] completely nude from their waist up and
[1:04:14] was marching to the time or twisting and
[1:04:17] carrying on with that music walking up
[1:04:19] and and said and said this was the one
[1:04:22] that was with him and said that is the
[1:04:24] church. He said it made me sick at my
[1:04:27] heart.
[1:04:29] Now as she passed by the whole back part
[1:04:32] had no covering at all. And then as she
[1:04:36] passed by I felt faint and sickly. And
[1:04:40] then he said the bride will come into
[1:04:43] view preview again. And here here the
[1:04:46] bride came behind her. That very same
[1:04:49] looking bride had passed at the
[1:04:51] beginning. He says, "And then my heart
[1:04:52] jumped for joy to know that there will
[1:04:55] be a bride and she'll be made of the
[1:04:58] same thing and clothed the same the same
[1:05:03] thing that the one was at the
[1:05:05] beginning."
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:08] [Music]
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; That's going to happen.
[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Every person in this building are going
[1:05:18] to be in one of those two groups. That's
[1:05:21] right.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; That's sobering.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; From the youngest to the eldest, that is
[1:05:29] sobering
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; to those on the platform, the preachers,
[1:05:34] the deacons, the trustees. It's
[1:05:36] sobering.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Announcement. Every person will be in
[1:05:47] one of those two groups. Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; It's not something in the future. It's
[1:05:57] something you're either being clothed
[1:05:59] right now. Those that were naked refused
[1:06:03] the garment
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; that God sent to clothe them
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; in this generation.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; We are being married here
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; and go to the wedding supper. It's not
[1:06:16] that we get clothed to go to the wedding
[1:06:19] supper. We get clothed for the wedding
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; in the greatest battle ever fought. He
[1:06:32] said, "God is getting his soldiers
[1:06:34] ready.
[1:06:35] God anoints his army. America dresses
[1:06:39] their soldiers in the best that they can
[1:06:42] have to dress with. steel helmets and
[1:06:45] armors and whatever they got armored
[1:06:47] tanks and whatever they've got get it go
[1:06:49] in and God dressed his army.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; and I will say behind the prophet,
[1:06:58] hallelujah,
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; God has dressed his army.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; We're not left here helpless friends.
[1:07:05] We're not left here unequipped. We're
[1:07:07] left here perfectly dressed for this
[1:07:09] world and now everything that it it can
[1:07:12] throw at us. He says, "And what kind of
[1:07:14] equipment do we use? The spirit of the
[1:07:17] sword, the word of God, the word of God
[1:07:21] sharper than a two-edged sword." Hebrews
[1:07:23] 4. piercing even to the ascender of the
[1:07:27] bone, even to the marrow of the bone,
[1:07:29] even the discerner of the thoughts. The
[1:07:32] equipment which we have, the equipment
[1:07:34] that a minister ministers behind the
[1:07:36] pulpit can penetrate the secret part of
[1:07:39] your heart. Even this morning, I'm aware
[1:07:42] of that. And the word of God is still a
[1:07:44] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:07:46] the heart.
[1:07:52] That's equipment.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; He said God fortified. This is putting
[1:08:00] on a whole armor. God fortified his
[1:08:01] army.
[1:08:04] What? With
[1:08:06] himself.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; I love when here when the prophet said,
[1:08:13] "You ought to see him ride out in battle
[1:08:16] once."
[1:08:17] You ought to see him right out in battle
[1:08:19] once. Friends, you're not left alone.
[1:08:22] You don't have to fight your own battle.
[1:08:24] God's going to fight your battle for
[1:08:26] you. I don't care what kind of battle it
[1:08:28] is. I don't care what Satan throws
[1:08:30] against you. We've got one who knows
[1:08:32] more about the economy. He knows more
[1:08:34] about the temptations. He knows more
[1:08:37] about sickness. And he is the victor.
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:47] He said, now I want you to hear this
[1:08:50] closely.
[1:08:52] He fortified his army what with himself
[1:08:56] in the form of it's himself
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; in the form of prophets, apostas,
[1:09:04] apostles,
[1:09:06] teachers,
[1:09:08] pastors.
[1:09:10] What did he do? What was God doing?
[1:09:12] Listen. Did you ever think what the
[1:09:16] offices of the church is? It's God's
[1:09:19] dress.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Inside dress. An apostle, a prophet, a
[1:09:24] seer. Foresee before Satan gets to it.
[1:09:28] Done. Told it.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; If you can believe it, friends,
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; this is your protection.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; What is it? God dressed up in his
[1:09:42] church. These offices is God's dressear.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; When you see these offices, when you see
[1:09:49] those offices,
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; pastors, teachers, evangelist, what is
[1:09:54] that? That's God's dress wear,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; God's presence, God's spirit, and it's
[1:10:03] working through man. And if that office
[1:10:06] denies any of this word, then it's not
[1:10:09] God's dressing.
[1:10:12] No, not that
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; God dressed the first Adam
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; and the first Eve. He dressed them in
[1:10:17] what they had to have. It wasn't what
[1:10:19] they wanted. It wasn't what they thought
[1:10:22] of,
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; but it was what they had to have.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; And God alone knows what's going to get
[1:10:29] us through this age
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; and get us from mortals into
[1:10:33] immortality.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; And what was it the message to the last
[1:10:37] Leodysian church age? You're wretched.
[1:10:40] Yeah,
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; you're blind
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; this age.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Don't look for any help around the
[1:10:46] country, friends. You're wretched.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; This age is wretched. God has already
[1:10:51] sentenced it. You're blind
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; and naked.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Why are they naked? Because God came
[1:11:02] down and tried to dress them.
[1:11:05] [Applause]
[1:11:09] I don't know who dressed
[1:11:12] these people that just got united in in
[1:11:15] a great cathedral and but here in little
[1:11:19] humble places.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; People are being dressed
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; by a prophet,
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; a prophet
[1:11:28] word
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; dressing the people.
[1:11:35] Hallelujah.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And if that office denies
[1:11:44] any of this word,
[1:11:48] then it's not God's dressing."
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; No, not that. That's the wolf
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; in sheep's clothing.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; And that's another one. Did you ever
[1:12:02] think of so much?
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Did you expect this morning that you'd
[1:12:06] hear so much about dressing and about
[1:12:09] clothing and so on when you went into
[1:12:11] your closet, you didn't dream you're
[1:12:12] going to hear this kind of a thing, but
[1:12:15] you you want to be thankful. And I say I
[1:12:18] say before God Almighty, I even said to
[1:12:21] God this morning in prayer, "Father, I'm
[1:12:24] here because as even as a young man, I
[1:12:28] felt the call of God
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; and I loved your word,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; never realizing that how important it's
[1:12:34] going to be to dress us and more and
[1:12:38] more concerned and more more intent upon
[1:12:41] it. As time goes on and as you get
[1:12:43] older, you want to you want to snug up
[1:12:46] even closer.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; And friends, don't live loose.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Don't take things lightly. Don't take
[1:12:53] this message lightly. Whatever you do,
[1:12:56] don't take a word that God vindicated
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; and take that prophet office and respect
[1:13:04] it
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; more than you respect anything. You
[1:13:08] respect that office and things will go
[1:13:10] well between you and God.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; And he's the one we want to please.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; He's the one I want to find grace with.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, respect that word.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And you'll find that you have a prophet
[1:13:29] dressing you.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; And at this place,
[1:13:34] you need some righteousness here. And
[1:13:37] over here you need some grace. And over
[1:13:40] here you need some something else.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; And you he knows how to dress you.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; We're either going to leave this life
[1:13:50] when we're changed. We leave this life
[1:13:53] clothed or naked.
[1:14:09] And the message Christianity versus
[1:14:13] idolatry
[1:14:17] our armor is Jesus Christ
[1:14:21] and all devils slide their brakes when
[1:14:24] they see that.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; All devils, all devils
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; slide their brakes.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Not when they see you, when they see
[1:14:41] what you're armed with.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; When they see your equipment,
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; when they see your dress,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; you wouldn't want to go with a simple
[1:14:54] little dart gun
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; in front of these guys the way they're
[1:14:58] equipped. I tell you what, it
[1:14:59] intimidates me when I see all the gear
[1:15:01] that some of the police force and the
[1:15:04] home homeland security and all these
[1:15:06] guys, they got spray and pepper and
[1:15:09] clubs and and handcuffs and every kind
[1:15:12] of restraint and body gear all over them
[1:15:15] and you can't touch them. I I wonder
[1:15:17] sometime how those women especially how
[1:15:19] they even walk.
[1:15:23] I even wondered. I went through the
[1:15:25] other day, they called me and I and my
[1:15:27] wife and spent another 40 minutes
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; doing nothing
[1:15:33] and we just stood there and I I I had
[1:15:35] time to study it.
[1:15:37] Thought how in the world I guess he
[1:15:39] needs it. I guess he needs it. I don't
[1:15:42] know what kind of thing. And do you know
[1:15:45] what they wear that day after day after
[1:15:48] day? Put that on. Snap it on. snap it
[1:15:50] here great big they have to find a walk
[1:15:52] like this
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; you know what I'm talking about and they
[1:15:56] might they might not face that in a
[1:15:58] lifetime they might not face the danger
[1:16:00] in lifetime but they're dressed like
[1:16:03] that by their leaders because it might
[1:16:06] happen just once
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; and God is dressing you for that moment
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; hallelujah God is dressing you for that
[1:16:13] moment and don't you slack off because
[1:16:16] it didn't happen today or it didn't
[1:16:18] happen last week. It didn't happen. God
[1:16:21] is equipping you for the moment you do
[1:16:23] need it.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching. You might not
[1:16:30] need it tomorrow. You might.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; But you get clothed.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; You get armed. You get equipped.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's what this garment's all about.
[1:16:39] It's equipment.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; So that when that dart does come, sir,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; it'll just fly off.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That temptation
[1:16:50] comes, it'll just fly off
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; that enemy, that dark cloud, that
[1:16:58] despondency. Be done with him.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Let that thing hit your your shield.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Now, the first time
[1:17:16] I'm taking another curve. Are you
[1:17:18] listening close? I know you are.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; The first time that the word
[1:17:23] righteousness
[1:17:24] appears in the Bible
[1:17:28] appears in God's redemption plan is in
[1:17:31] this line
[1:17:34] speaking of Abram.
[1:17:37] And he believed in the Lord.
[1:17:40] He believed in the Lord. Now we're going
[1:17:44] to come where the war really is. He
[1:17:47] believed in the Lord and he counted it
[1:17:50] to him for righteousness.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Come and I'll show you the lamb's wife.
[1:18:01] And it was given to her that she should
[1:18:04] be arrayed
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; in fine linen. And the fine linen is the
[1:18:11] righteousness of the saints.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; She's Abraham's children.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; She's Abraham's royal seed. Abraham
[1:18:21] believed God. And for the first time, it
[1:18:23] scribed in the Bible and it was
[1:18:26] accounted to him for righteousness.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that Abraham was a good man.
[1:18:31] The prophet said he was an idol
[1:18:33] worshipper or had come from an idol
[1:18:35] worshshiping family at least. And the
[1:18:37] Jew Jewish people have a tradition says
[1:18:40] the same thing. So it wasn't it wasn't
[1:18:43] that Abraham was looked at. That it
[1:18:46] wasn't Abraham was checked out that
[1:18:48] Abraham was was come before God and God
[1:18:52] looked at him and examined him and
[1:18:54] called him a righteous and accounted him
[1:18:55] as a righteous man. That wasn't it. It
[1:18:58] was that Abraham believed God and
[1:19:01] Abraham actually reversed what Adam and
[1:19:04] Eve did.
[1:19:06] They went one direction, he went the
[1:19:08] other. They doubted God. He believed
[1:19:11] God.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And so God made him promise. I'm going
[1:19:14] to give you a seed. Like, I need a seed.
[1:19:17] I want a son. You're going to have a
[1:19:20] son. Your Isaac will be a type of my
[1:19:23] son, Jesus Christ. And he'll come
[1:19:25] through that lineage. Oh, I tell you
[1:19:27] what, friends. I got a I got a basket
[1:19:30] full, but I can't give it to you right
[1:19:32] now.
[1:19:35] Don't fall silent like that.
[1:19:42] And he believed God. You must, this is
[1:19:44] the main connection right now. He
[1:19:46] believed God. Believing God, I don't
[1:19:50] want to take anything away from you.
[1:19:51] Believing God is not merely coming to
[1:19:53] church.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Believing God is not just having the
[1:19:57] fellowship of the believers. Believing
[1:20:00] God is not even just coming to the altar
[1:20:02] and and maybe repeating or repenting or
[1:20:05] whatever more. Believing God is is
[1:20:08] actually taking the word the word that
[1:20:12] God vindicated
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; and absorbing it.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; And believing it. And if you don't do
[1:20:18] it, the prophet said you don't believe
[1:20:20] it.
[1:20:29] and he believed God and was counted for
[1:20:31] him for righteousness. So I I would also
[1:20:34] like you to notice from that time that
[1:20:37] is in Genesis 15. And from that time
[1:20:40] until the son came
[1:20:43] from that time until the son came
[1:20:47] Abraham's struggle
[1:20:50] was to believe.
[1:20:52] That was always the struggle. Where's my
[1:20:55] son? Who's going to inherit
[1:20:58] the inheritance?
[1:21:01] this Eleazar from Damascus, where where
[1:21:05] is the where is my son? That was always
[1:21:09] the the question that he had a struggle
[1:21:12] with. It wasn't that he was praying for
[1:21:15] victory over something else. He he he
[1:21:19] even he told a lie. Say that you're my
[1:21:22] sister. He didn't even get convicted and
[1:21:25] repent over it.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Now you're real quiet.
[1:21:31] you now you're real quiet and say,
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; "Isn't that the scripture?"
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; God never came to him and said, "You
[1:21:38] lied.
[1:21:40] You have to repent over that or I can't
[1:21:43] call you righteous."
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; No. The fact was he believed God.
[1:21:48] He kept asking for the son, but he
[1:21:51] believed that the son was on its way
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; and it's going to happen. It's going to
[1:21:56] happen. We're going to have the son. And
[1:21:58] God said, "You're righteous."
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You know something, friends? I may not
[1:22:03] be getting this across to you, but if
[1:22:05] you you get yourself into a relationship
[1:22:08] where you believe God and you please
[1:22:11] him,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; he's not going to be examining every
[1:22:20] thought that went through your mind and
[1:22:22] every word you said and oh, you lost it
[1:22:26] there and you're you showed some temper
[1:22:29] there and you became impatient there and
[1:22:32] you did this here. That's not the point.
[1:22:35] The point is how do you believe?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, are you just wiping
[1:22:40] all those other things off?" No, I'm
[1:22:42] not. But the only way to have have
[1:22:45] success in your life is to be a
[1:22:47] believer. That's your foundation. He
[1:22:49] believed and you will come to your
[1:22:51] location. You will come to your
[1:22:55] place.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; That ought to make anyone happy. I can
[1:22:59] show that to you in the Bible. I'll
[1:23:02] never forget when brother Jeremiah from
[1:23:04] Zimbabwe was here and was speaking and
[1:23:06] he and he took a number of things in his
[1:23:08] way of teaching in such a lovely way. He
[1:23:10] took a number of things and and the the
[1:23:13] way the scribes and the Pharisees acted
[1:23:15] and what they spoke and and what they
[1:23:18] did and what they were condemned for
[1:23:20] doing.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; And Jesus even condemned them for doing
[1:23:24] those things. And yet he brought out how
[1:23:26] that the same thing happened amongst his
[1:23:29] own his own disciples. But he never
[1:23:31] corrected them for it the same way. He
[1:23:34] never dealt with them the same way. Why?
[1:23:37] Because they believed who he was.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; And that was the foundation.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; I know people who who are are perhaps
[1:23:46] very very weak in the natural or in the
[1:23:48] flesh, but they have they have a love
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; for the message. They love this Lord
[1:23:54] Jesus. And I can tell you friends, that
[1:23:57] to me is the foundation. That's ground
[1:24:00] zero. How a person loves and holds and
[1:24:04] and holds dear the message to them and
[1:24:07] seeks to believe it with all their
[1:24:09] heart.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; I walked around this morning. I said in
[1:24:16] the study, "Dress me, oh God. There's no
[1:24:20] one that knows what I need like you
[1:24:23] need. Dress me. Dress me in your
[1:24:25] righteousness. Dress me with revelation.
[1:24:28] Let your prophet's words dress me.
[1:24:32] [Applause]
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; How many of you you be honest with
[1:24:37] yourself? You had a question in your
[1:24:39] heart. You had a question in your mind
[1:24:41] and and you picked up a message and you
[1:24:43] started to read and you found exactly
[1:24:46] what you were thinking in your mind,
[1:24:47] what you were questioning. How many have
[1:24:49] had that experience because the author
[1:24:52] of that message knew exactly what you
[1:24:54] needed?
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; He's dressing you.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; He's equipping you for the day for the
[1:25:02] for the thing that you were facing. He's
[1:25:04] equipping you.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Your wedding garment friends
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; in the message looking. So I want to
[1:25:16] speak about the supreme struggle now for
[1:25:18] a moment. The battle between belief and
[1:25:21] unbelief.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a time the church
[1:25:26] needs to step across the line which
[1:25:29] separates you between faith and unbelief
[1:25:32] by sight and looking at the unseen by
[1:25:35] faith is now. If there ever was a time
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; where we need to step across the line
[1:25:41] from unbelief to faith,
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; it's in this age. Everything is thrown
[1:25:46] against everything. All of our senses
[1:25:49] and everything. Let me tell you friends,
[1:25:51] my precious friends, it's lying to you.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Your feelings are lying to you. They're
[1:25:57] lying vanities.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; And Satan has access.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Access to your memory channel. Your
[1:26:03] conscience has access to all those
[1:26:05] things. And he's stuffing it full. You
[1:26:08] have to say, "Oh, Holy Spirit, author of
[1:26:11] this word here, come according to your
[1:26:13] prophet's message and blow those flues
[1:26:16] clean."
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Let those thoughts be gone.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; And if you're here and you've been
[1:26:23] hounded by the enemy about your past or
[1:26:27] about your unsaved life, you tell that
[1:26:30] devil to go to hell
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; because that's where he's going.
[1:26:36] I use that terminology
[1:26:39] with respect. That is where he's going.
[1:26:42] He's destined for hell.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; That's where he's going to end up.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; And he has no business on your trail.
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; You say he's hounding you and on your
[1:26:58] trail and in your mind and giving you
[1:27:01] thoughts and trying to work emotions.
[1:27:04] You tell him to get out of your life.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; You've got the equipment.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; This isn't an idol course where you're
[1:27:12] saying, "I've got we've got the power
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. We have the power.
[1:27:17] I have to preach this."
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Some of you are your your theophony body
[1:27:23] is calling for this sermon. I'm
[1:27:26] preaching it because you need it. You
[1:27:29] must not live a defeated life
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; when Christ has equipped us in such a
[1:27:34] way.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; In Queen of Sheba, he said, "And there's
[1:27:42] only two faculties that can govern you,
[1:27:45] and that's either faith or unbelief."
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Say amen, would you? Yes.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; There's only two faculties,
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; only two faculties,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; That can govern you,
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; control you.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Faith or unbelief.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; It's not nothing halfway in between.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; You cannot be halfway between.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; And the only sin that there is is
[1:28:16] unbelief. Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; I think the congregation should say that
[1:28:21] the only sin that there is is unbelief.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; All the others are attributes.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Not that it makes them any better.
[1:28:31] They're attributes of unbelief. But when
[1:28:33] a person finds himself stumbling and
[1:28:35] stumbling and stumbling, the problem is
[1:28:37] you're you're failing to believe.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To believe.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; That's why Satan hates the believer.
[1:28:47] Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't care about popularity.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; In time of decision, I want to be honest
[1:28:55] to my master as Eleazar was."
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; I want a clean cut decision out of you.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Like Eleazar
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; and sign of the sign of this time.
[1:29:12] Notice now sign of this time. It's the
[1:29:14] message and that's a true servant of God
[1:29:18] always is obedient to his master. That's
[1:29:22] a true servant of God.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Not to show off or say something to
[1:29:27] elate somebody else, but to be honest
[1:29:30] and true with him that sent him.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; And that's a true servant of Christ. And
[1:29:36] then he goes on like Eleazar, a
[1:29:39] representative
[1:29:41] coming from Abraham to pick up the bride
[1:29:44] to Isaac, the beautiful Rebecca,
[1:29:47] obedient, the model servant. He was
[1:29:51] about his master's business alone.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; What a type of the Holy Spirit today.
[1:29:58] Now I just have to take you back a wee
[1:30:02] bit
[1:30:04] in brother Bram's ministry
[1:30:07] and in his first service that you have
[1:30:09] recorded in faith is the substance with
[1:30:13] 1947 before many of you were born and he
[1:30:17] says these words and if I can get you to
[1:30:20] believe me with all your hearts that's
[1:30:24] what moves God.
[1:30:29] That's not algebra.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; That's not complicated.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; That's not rocket science.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; If I can get you to believe me,
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; that's what moves God. Yes, sir.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Friends, that's still a very, very
[1:30:46] important statement for us.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; If I can get you to believe me, he said,
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; that's what moves God. You want God to
[1:30:55] move,
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; you believe what he has said
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; in a trial. I'm trying to get you to
[1:31:02] believe it. Have faith in God.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; An identified Christ of all ages. It's
[1:31:08] to get you to believe that his presence
[1:31:10] is here to keep his word in the voice of
[1:31:14] the sign. Could you ever grasp what is
[1:31:18] going on?
[1:31:19] Now, he's talking to a group of people
[1:31:21] there. Why is he saying that? Because he
[1:31:24] knew they were having difficulty to
[1:31:26] grasp what is going on.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; And when I read that, I had to say to
[1:31:32] myself, I said to God, that's no
[1:31:34] different than right this morning. And I
[1:31:36] have to say this, I'm going to quote
[1:31:38] this because the congregation here and
[1:31:40] the people he was speaking to all have
[1:31:42] the same difficulty to grasp what's
[1:31:45] going on.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Pinch yourself.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:52] I hope you don't think that speaking
[1:31:54] like that that I'm trying to influence
[1:31:57] you to look at some man or believe some
[1:31:59] man. I'm not doing that, friend. I'm
[1:32:03] trying to get you to believe who it is
[1:32:06] that we're in the presence of now.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; And that happens to be probably one of
[1:32:12] the most uh difficult things that we as
[1:32:15] humans have is to recognize in whose
[1:32:18] presence we are now. And I have to keep
[1:32:21] going back to uh who is this MelzDC and
[1:32:24] some of these others that they even so
[1:32:27] like the voices are here, the airwaves
[1:32:30] are here, radio sound signals are here,
[1:32:33] television images are going through the
[1:32:35] room and he says so is the angels here.
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; All they need is some apparatus that can
[1:32:45] catch a hold of it and your heart. You
[1:32:49] have the you have the facility. You have
[1:32:51] the capacity. You actually have been
[1:32:54] given by God something within your soul
[1:32:56] that can reach out
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; and lay hold of the influence of the
[1:33:02] supernatural beings. And he said, "And
[1:33:04] even so is Christ here."
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Where's Christ? He's in the air between
[1:33:08] you brothers and me. between these
[1:33:10] brothers, between you at the seat, the
[1:33:13] atmosphere, every attribute of Almighty
[1:33:16] God is per permeating the air you're
[1:33:19] breathing.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; So the word of faith is na you even in
[1:33:23] your mouth.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Speak it.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Say it.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Believe it.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; That's according to the word of God. The
[1:33:33] word of God. Faith is ny even in your
[1:33:36] mouth.
[1:33:38] Amen.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; It's for people for us to realize the
[1:33:41] challenge is to realize who's here to
[1:33:43] believe what he said.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; That's the challenge.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; I won't ask for you to raise your hand,
[1:33:50] but there isn't a man or woman or child
[1:33:53] here. But what they have something to
[1:33:55] say, I just desire a change. I desire a
[1:33:59] transformation. You have the power to
[1:34:02] bring that about by believing the word.
[1:34:05] And if the word tells you that the power
[1:34:07] is right resonant with us,
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; that is the one thing that's so
[1:34:12] difficult to grasp. That's why it was
[1:34:15] the same there as it is here. Is that to
[1:34:17] grasp that he is present.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; He is present.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; The supernatural is present.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Lay hold of it.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; You ought to sing and shout and dance.
[1:34:33] My answer has come.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; I don't have to keep waiting and waiting
[1:34:38] for my change to come.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; The change is present with me.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the eternal one,
[1:34:44] but the thing that you desire.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; The servant.
[1:34:49] Brother Brenham.
[1:34:51] He compared himself to Eleazar the
[1:34:54] servant.
[1:35:01] I'd sooner have a man called William
[1:35:03] Brandham than I'd have Eleazar.
[1:35:09] And the Bible says and Eleazar gave
[1:35:11] jewels
[1:35:14] of gold
[1:35:16] and jewels of silver
[1:35:20] and raignment.
[1:35:22] And the jewels
[1:35:24] can be anything from precious stones to
[1:35:27] but precious stones is not the first
[1:35:29] thing in the Hebrew. A jewel is an
[1:35:32] instrument or an implement or a vessel.
[1:35:36] I tell you in a country if you didn't
[1:35:38] have you didn't have something to hold
[1:35:40] water
[1:35:42] and bring it from the well in a place
[1:35:44] that's all sand dunes and maybe 110 or
[1:35:47] 15 degrees every day and you're living
[1:35:50] under a tent of goat skins.
[1:35:52] You don't want some ruby stone that you
[1:35:55] hang on your forehead.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; That won't do you any good.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; But if somebody give you a nice vessel
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; it's a jewel. So there were vessels.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; It was an implement.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; It was a utensil.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; An implement for hunting or for war. If
[1:36:14] you had raiders coming in and you were
[1:36:17] given an implement, jewels, an implement
[1:36:21] to protect yourself, an implement to get
[1:36:24] you food and to get you water and
[1:36:27] something to protect you and to give you
[1:36:29] what you have need of. And you and and
[1:36:32] or it could be something an implement or
[1:36:34] a tool for labor and also it also come
[1:36:38] from a second word and that is to
[1:36:40] accomplish or to finish. He gave her
[1:36:42] jewels that she would be complete. She
[1:36:45] to be accomplished to an end to finish
[1:36:49] to be completed and to be fulfilled. She
[1:36:52] was unmarried and he and he was bringing
[1:36:55] her the news and going to lead her and
[1:36:59] take her back to where she'd be united
[1:37:02] with the husband and make her one of the
[1:37:04] great women of the Bible.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; That's been completed.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Took her out of an empty house. Took her
[1:37:10] out of just a another girl in the family
[1:37:13] and raised her up to be a mother of the
[1:37:16] faith. Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, that's
[1:37:19] something that that's being really
[1:37:21] finished and that's a fulfilled life.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; And here's the servant.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Here's what your servant has said.
[1:37:39] Here's what he's saying.
[1:37:41] He's saying, "I believe you are here.
[1:37:46] I know you are here.
[1:37:49] Your spirit is moving. He didn't ask the
[1:37:53] people, do you feel it? He said, I know
[1:37:55] it's that way.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; And because he said that, I also know
[1:37:58] it's that way.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; I know that this Holy Spirit which gave
[1:38:02] authorship to this message, this word is
[1:38:05] present to stand behind this word. And
[1:38:08] if I believe it with all my heart and
[1:38:10] punctuate it with an amen, if you'll
[1:38:13] punctuate it, it'll go from my soul to
[1:38:15] your soul, it'll go from this attribute
[1:38:18] to your attribute.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "We feel the sweetness of your
[1:38:26] presence. You're moving through the
[1:38:28] audience doing just what you said you
[1:38:32] would do. And now, Father, we thank you
[1:38:35] for doing this. We believe and I take
[1:38:38] and he said and I simply repeat what he
[1:38:41] said so that the people will know uh
[1:38:44] what kind of servant
[1:38:46] has come to get you
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; and I take every one of these souls
[1:38:52] that's standing at this altar place
[1:38:55] yourself there
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; in your own soul and spirit place
[1:38:59] yourself there as your servant I stand
[1:39:03] between them and death
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; I stand between them and unbelief.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's the kind of servant I
[1:39:10] want.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of man I want to dress
[1:39:13] me.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; And I pitch myself in the way in the
[1:39:18] name of Jesus Christ. And I say to Satan
[1:39:21] that binds them, you cannot hold them
[1:39:24] any longer.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; I challenge every devil that's present
[1:39:29] to leave these people and to come out of
[1:39:32] them. What a servant.
[1:39:34] You cannot hold them any longer. Their
[1:39:37] sins are forgiven.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Their unbelief is gone.
[1:39:43] [Applause]
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; This congregation ought to explode.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; That's your servant.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; That's your messenger speaking.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Don't go home with your unbelief. Don't
[1:40:01] go home with your questions. say, "I
[1:40:04] accept that."
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; If it's good enough for those people
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; and he would give it to those people and
[1:40:11] he's no respector person, then I accept
[1:40:14] that
[1:40:17] [Applause]
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; their unbelief is gone. They're children
[1:40:23] of God from this hour on
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; their ministry is in their life will be
[1:40:28] great.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; The power of God shall accompany them
[1:40:31] everywhere they go. Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; They shall be God's children from this
[1:40:36] hour on.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Satan, I'm talking to you.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:47] Eleazar couldn't say that. Eleazar had
[1:40:50] no call or capacity to say that. But the
[1:40:53] last church age messenger knew that
[1:40:56] there had to be a bride seal. Satan, I'm
[1:40:59] talking to you. The devil has been
[1:41:01] talking to you. has been talked to by a
[1:41:03] prophet.
[1:41:06] The devil tries to lie to you. He's
[1:41:09] already heard a prophet's message.
[1:41:11] Satan, I'm talking to you. Let those
[1:41:14] people go.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; They are forgiven.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Their unbelief is gone.
[1:41:21] [Applause]
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't want to receive that?
[1:41:26] [Music]
[1:41:27] [Applause]
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:32] This is reality, friend. I don't care
[1:41:34] what kind of problem you have. This is
[1:41:36] the solution.
[1:41:39] [Applause]
[1:41:40] [Music]
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Leave them in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:41:48] and come out of them. Now he says, "Now
[1:41:51] every one of you believe it and raise up
[1:41:54] your hands and give him praise and you
[1:41:56] can go from here free tonight in the
[1:41:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:42:03] God is timeless.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; It has no difference about when that was
[1:42:08] said and what is today. That same God
[1:42:11] who sent that same man sent him to you.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; He was their servant. He's your servant.
[1:42:17] That's why God preserved his voice.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; So you would hear the same words. These
[1:42:23] are not somebody else's words. This
[1:42:25] isn't from memory. These are his words.
[1:42:27] Do you hear it, friends?
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Let me see you raise your hands on the
[1:42:32] balcony.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; You hear? You accept it. You believe it.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; It's to you directly.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:42] [Music]
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:47] [Music]
[1:42:48] So it is said of Rebecca
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; that she was given jewels,
[1:42:53] brought forth jewels and raymond and
[1:42:55] gave them to Rebecca.
[1:42:58] But of the wife of the lamb, it is said
[1:43:00] that she was granted to be arrayed in
[1:43:02] fine linen which was the righteousness
[1:43:04] of the saints.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; And to be arrayed, as I said earlier, to
[1:43:08] be put in a proper order.
[1:43:11] You were in a place, who knows where you
[1:43:14] were. I don't know what your past or
[1:43:15] your religious background or anything
[1:43:17] else but you were in the wrong
[1:43:19] arrangement
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; and you couldn't be arrayed in
[1:43:23] righteousness there
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; and so he's taken you and put you in a
[1:43:26] proper arrangement. Amen.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; He said in the evening messenger, now
[1:43:31] notice, evening messenger, your servant,
[1:43:34] your prophet, your messenger.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; He said, Eleazar, he sweated it out.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; And he found character.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; He was looking for character.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; You that have the devil talking in your
[1:43:48] ear, you don't have the character of
[1:43:50] Jesus Christ, I can tell you that you
[1:43:53] have the substance that produces that
[1:43:55] character. Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And he says until he found it,
[1:44:03] he says, "Who would he get?" And he
[1:44:07] trusted God. Character for what?
[1:44:10] Character for Isaac, the bride, which
[1:44:13] the church is a type of. It says, "And
[1:44:16] that was the natural seed of Abraham."
[1:44:19] This is the royal seed of Abraham. Well,
[1:44:22] if Eleazar the messenger hunting the
[1:44:25] bride and trying to find character,
[1:44:28] if that man is come, a messenger in the
[1:44:34] last day,
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; trying to find the bride for Christ,
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; he will not look for denominational
[1:44:43] memberships.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; How thankful you and I ought to be. He
[1:44:48] didn't adjoin himself and attach himself
[1:44:50] to some big church for denominational
[1:44:52] memberships, but he spoke to the rank
[1:44:55] and file. He spoke to the poor. He spoke
[1:44:58] in little house meetings to find
[1:45:02] character.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Character that would love the word, love
[1:45:07] this Christ.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; He will look for character that's
[1:45:12] willing.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Watch. She said good character first,
[1:45:18] then to get her ready to meet Isaac.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; After he found the character,
[1:45:25] then to get her to stand still
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; long enough
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; to listen to the message of Isaac.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; It couldn't be worded any more
[1:45:38] perfectly.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. We say we sit
[1:45:42] here in a comfortable church, but we
[1:45:44] hear the word of God and we know that
[1:45:46] the Holy Spirit who brought this message
[1:45:49] is bringing it to you.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; And this is part of God's dressing.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; The apostles, the prophets, the pastors,
[1:45:56] the evangelists is part of God's dress.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; God through it is dressing you.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:06] If you've ever put if you've ever put
[1:46:08] the wedding uh the wedding garment
[1:46:10] someplace in the future, forget it.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; We're being united now.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; We're being dressed now
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; that we shall not be found naked.
[1:46:24] [Applause]
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; And this business is standing still long
[1:46:34] enough.
[1:46:37] in the Brandham tabernacle on the wall.
[1:46:40] If you've seen the pictures, be still
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; and know that I am God.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Be still
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; is being the part of it.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; You won't find that he's God. If you're
[1:46:52] always agitated and you know your mind
[1:46:54] is going and and you hear something and
[1:46:57] you hear something from the word, you
[1:46:58] hear something from the message and the
[1:47:00] mind is going off uh 90 miles an hour
[1:47:03] trying to find some objection to it.
[1:47:04] It's a devil.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; It's a devil trying to find an objection
[1:47:08] to it.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; And other people want to say, "You're
[1:47:11] just brainwashed." Praise God. I got
[1:47:13] brainwashed.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:18] I find what I have is something that the
[1:47:20] world hasn't got.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; And the pretenders don't have it and the
[1:47:24] hitchhikers don't have it.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; You may wonder why I'm looking so
[1:47:31] intently. I'm looking for your response.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; I'm looking to say you believe it.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; If you believe it, you shall receive it.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who wouldn't want this?
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't want this? Lovely Lord
[1:47:51] Jesus.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Preparing you to meet him. Preparing you
[1:47:58] to physically
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; say him.
[1:48:02] [Music]
[1:48:09] trying to find a bride for Christ
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; that she will stand still
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; to get her stand still long enough to
[1:48:19] listen to his message of Isaac
[1:48:25] in the prayer of dedication of the
[1:48:26] church of the
[1:48:29] God hiding himself in simplicity's first
[1:48:31] message in the seals message
[1:48:34] he says may the Holy Spirit spirit as it
[1:48:36] was in the day of the dedication. Now
[1:48:38] notice he's bringing it from the day of
[1:48:40] the dedication way back there which you
[1:48:42] read of I think in Chronicles the 17th
[1:48:44] chapter and he's bringing it right to
[1:48:46] the present moment. He said when Solomon
[1:48:49] prayed in the Holy Spirit in the form of
[1:48:50] a pillar of fire and cloud came in the
[1:48:53] front door and rode up around the
[1:48:55] cherubams and went over to the holy
[1:48:58] place and there took its resting place.
[1:49:02] And then he goes into prayer. Oh Lord
[1:49:03] God,
[1:49:06] let it repeat again as we give ourselves
[1:49:09] to thee.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; And I'm reading this because that God
[1:49:13] that was back at that dedication at the
[1:49:16] dedication of the tabernacle, we're
[1:49:18] dedicating ourselves. It wasn't the
[1:49:20] building that was important. It was the
[1:49:22] people.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; And it says the people, they're the
[1:49:24] character.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; He said, and he it said this, and I'm
[1:49:29] taking this prayer for ourselves. And is
[1:49:32] written. It is written. Ask and you
[1:49:36] shall receive.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Believe it, friends.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't want you to believe
[1:49:42] it. Satan doesn't want you to believe
[1:49:43] it.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Believe that. Ask and you shall receive.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And we commit ourselves with our
[1:49:50] offering of the church this morning to
[1:49:53] you for service for the latter day light
[1:49:56] for the evening time lights.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. that we might bring consolation
[1:50:01] and faith to the waiting people that's
[1:50:04] waiting for the coming of the bridegroom
[1:50:07] to dress a bride. Here they go in
[1:50:11] simplicity at the opening of the seals
[1:50:14] waiting for the coming of the bridegroom
[1:50:17] to dress a bride in the gospel of Christ
[1:50:21] for the Lord Jesus Christ to receive
[1:50:24] this. We dedicate said myself and
[1:50:26] brother Neville and the congregation to
[1:50:30] the service of God in the name of Jesus
[1:50:33] Christ. That was the dedication. I say I
[1:50:35] receive that dedication prayer on my own
[1:50:38] behalf. Amen.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; On the ministry of this church, on the
[1:50:42] original vision of this church, I said,
[1:50:44] "Oh, God." Didn't start here, friends.
[1:50:46] It started in a house.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And that same God met us in the house.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; And here's one of the brothers of one of
[1:50:53] the earlier brothers. There's several
[1:50:54] others. And the first thing I suggested
[1:50:57] to all of them was get into the tape.
[1:51:01] [Applause]
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Hear what he said.
[1:51:06] I didn't have anything valid to say.
[1:51:08] Nobody has anything valid to say.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; I've had people come in, young men, and
[1:51:14] go into the message and go through the
[1:51:16] serpent seed, and they couldn't wait to
[1:51:18] get out of there. They said, "I'm going
[1:51:19] to go and tell our pastor." I said, "I I
[1:51:22] wouldn't do that." Oh, he'll see this.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; It was so clear, crystal clear. They
[1:51:27] went out, never saw them again.
[1:51:35] This garment's not a patch quilt.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; It's not what my pastor thinks or what
[1:51:39] somebody else thinks or what I was
[1:51:41] taught in Sunday school. That was one of
[1:51:43] the things I ran into snags all the time
[1:51:45] is I started going through the message.
[1:51:47] I thought that isn't what I was taught
[1:51:48] in Sunday school.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; And then I said, am I going to put my
[1:51:52] Sunday school teacher at an equal basis
[1:51:54] with this prophet? So I had to disregard
[1:51:56] them. Disregard that. disregarded all my
[1:51:59] own ideas. I had a wonderful sermon on
[1:52:02] typology out of the out of the Old
[1:52:05] Testament and I found out and and and it
[1:52:08] was well I'll just tell you about it. I
[1:52:10] preached on it as a young fellow and
[1:52:13] where where the servant when it got the
[1:52:15] year jubilee and he could go free and he
[1:52:19] wouldn't go. He just wanted to stay with
[1:52:21] his master and his master would bore an
[1:52:24] all through his ear
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; and put a hole in his ear because and we
[1:52:29] preached and not only me, I heard others
[1:52:32] preach. He just loved the master so
[1:52:34] much. And so the master just marked him
[1:52:36] and he never he never left that master.
[1:52:39] He became a servant of his master
[1:52:41] forever. That's what he wanted to. And I
[1:52:44] thought, you know, it's like a love
[1:52:45] mark. And the prophet turned right
[1:52:47] around says, "When you heard the
[1:52:49] message, you wouldn't go and you got
[1:52:51] marked with that denominational thing
[1:52:53] and you remained a slave forever."
[1:52:56] Thought, "Oh my goodness, there there's
[1:52:59] another one's got to go out.
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; We had to forget a few, didn't we,
[1:53:05] brother Ernie?"
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Lots of them.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; But now we have an absolute.
[1:53:15] People say, "Oh, that's dangerous." Oh,
[1:53:17] it is dangerous for the devil.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Not dangerous for you or me.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, that serpent, he's so slick. He
[1:53:27] wants to come in and and and and
[1:53:29] destabilize you on what you believe,
[1:53:32] well, you just watch it. The very
[1:53:33] purpose he wants to destabilize you is
[1:53:36] cuz he got something he wants to slip
[1:53:37] in.
[1:53:40] And soon as they see you shake and
[1:53:42] question a wee bit, says, "I got the
[1:53:44] answer for you. Is it vindicated?" No,
[1:53:47] it's not vindicated. They don't even
[1:53:49] know what vindication means.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Is it the presence of the pillar of
[1:53:53] fire? They don't even know what you're
[1:53:55] talking about. You're speaking in
[1:53:57] tongues.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; You're speaking in unknown tongues.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:54:10] Can I go a few more minutes?
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I got some things
[1:54:19] that I can't fully answer,
[1:54:23] but nevertheless, uh
[1:54:28] you can think about this one. Don't
[1:54:29] think about it too long because I want
[1:54:30] to go on.
[1:54:32] But this beautiful Rebecca
[1:54:36] when Jacob and Esau came
[1:54:41] and Jacob loved the birthright.
[1:54:45] Now remember what I said a few minutes
[1:54:47] ago. You can have all kinds of faults
[1:54:50] and all kinds of weaknesses and all
[1:54:52] kinds of failures and all kinds of
[1:54:55] things. Some of you are born stubborn
[1:54:59] and some of you are born
[1:55:02] you'd go almost anyway and some of you
[1:55:05] born with different desires and things.
[1:55:07] That's all part of your upbringing.
[1:55:10] And some of you born quiet, can't hardly
[1:55:13] pry an amen out of you. Others are born
[1:55:17] boisterous and a whole bunch all in
[1:55:20] between. And uh uh this message isn't a
[1:55:25] mold where we just push everybody
[1:55:27] through and they all come through like
[1:55:28] so many sausages. The same size, the
[1:55:30] same, you know, that's not that's not
[1:55:32] what the message is. You're you're
[1:55:35] quiet. Well, okay, you're quiet. If
[1:55:37] you're boisterous, fine. Glory to God.
[1:55:40] We need some of those.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Uh some are emotional, some aren't
[1:55:44] emotional. Uh so we have all of those
[1:55:47] things that that's all human. That's all
[1:55:49] in the natural level.
[1:55:52] Put this one together.
[1:55:54] Rebecca,
[1:55:57] she favors Jacob.
[1:56:00] And Isaac, brother Brown calls him the
[1:56:03] prophet.
[1:56:05] And he said he became he was now blind
[1:56:07] naturally and he became spiritually
[1:56:10] blind.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; A prophet became spiritually blind.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:56:14] and and and now watch the thoughts of
[1:56:18] God
[1:56:19] somehow
[1:56:22] I won't even try to explain this but she
[1:56:25] takes Esau's garment
[1:56:29] and puts it on
[1:56:31] uh Jacob
[1:56:35] and Esau was a hairy man
[1:56:38] and so he got skins and put it over his
[1:56:41] hands
[1:56:44] She's working in deception
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; and she's going to deceive the prophet,
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Into blessing her favorite son,
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; which happened to be God's favorite.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; She was already working in the realm
[1:57:05] Jacob of love, Satan, Esau of hated.
[1:57:11] you're quiet,
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; you'll go home thinking this one over.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; So, she actually works in this deception
[1:57:19] and gets a blessing by deception.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; And
[1:57:29] even by a lie.
[1:57:31] Who art thou my son? I am Esau, thy
[1:57:34] firstborn.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:57:39] You say, "How in the world could God
[1:57:41] bless that?" Because he had his mind on
[1:57:44] one thing, the birthight. I got to have
[1:57:46] the birthight. And whatever it gets to
[1:57:49] take the birthight.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; I expect you to be quiet. You know why?
[1:57:59] You're not going to figure it out
[1:58:00] either.
[1:58:02] But I can tell you one thing.
[1:58:05] I I've had to overlook a whole lot
[1:58:09] truckloads of weaknesses and all kinds
[1:58:12] of things that happened. You ought to
[1:58:14] see the gang we had when this church
[1:58:17] first started. Tell you what, you know,
[1:58:20] that's why I believe in miracles.
[1:58:23] We lived in miracles all the time. We
[1:58:25] just lived in miracles and faults and
[1:58:28] failures and this and that and oh my
[1:58:31] goodness, all the rest of it. But they
[1:58:33] loved the word.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; When they heard the word, they loved the
[1:58:37] word.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Jacob had to have the birthright.
[1:58:41] Whatever it took to get the birthight,
[1:58:43] climb over over whoseever head and do
[1:58:46] whatever you need to do. Have your mama
[1:58:48] make a pot of stew, wear your brother's
[1:58:51] uh garments, and and and then and then
[1:58:54] here's where I think Isaac, oh, God,
[1:58:56] forgive me if I'm wrong. I think where
[1:58:58] Isaac made his mistake. He said, "Come
[1:59:01] near my son."
[1:59:05] And he smelt him.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; That's one of the channels of the flesh.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; And he smelled right.
[1:59:14] And he said, "Come close." And he felt
[1:59:18] him.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; That was the second channel.
[1:59:22] And so he smelt him and he felt him. So
[1:59:25] you feel right.
[1:59:27] He said, "Have you made some pottage?"
[1:59:30] "Yes, I have it here. Something that my
[1:59:33] father loves." And so he ate the pottage
[1:59:35] and it tasted right.
[1:59:40] He had a little twinge with his hearing,
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; but maybe it was like mine wasn't all
[1:59:46] that good anyway. So he says, "Well, you
[1:59:49] smell like Esau.
[1:59:52] You feel like Esau.
[1:59:55] You don't quite sound like Esau, but
[1:59:58] anyway, he convinced him, I am Esau.
[2:00:01] So, just come here and I'll bless you.
[2:00:04] And he just blessed him. You You think
[2:00:06] that, oh, well, anybody I can just take
[2:00:09] that back. I'll just rewrite it. I'll
[2:00:10] just do something different. No, no, no.
[2:00:14] God sees these things.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; God has a certain order. God has a
[2:00:18] certain arrangement. And he just
[2:00:20] finished blessing him when Esau came
[2:00:22] through the door. Father, here's the
[2:00:24] pottage. Have blessed me.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; He said, I've already blessed
[2:00:30] Jacob.
[2:00:33] And the Bible says he cried and he
[2:00:36] wailed with a loud voice because you
[2:00:39] can't take that back. Let me tell you
[2:00:41] something, friends. When God put a
[2:00:44] blessing
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; on this messenger and this message and
[2:00:49] all who believe it,
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; it's the same God who said, "Who I've
[2:00:53] blessed, I've blessed.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; And I cannot reverse it."
[2:01:00] Oh, I'm glad he can't reverse it. Even
[2:01:03] God can't reverse it. I bless this word.
[2:01:07] I bless this servant. I bless this
[2:01:09] prophet. I bless this message. And I
[2:01:12] bless all who believe it.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; All friends.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; You get what I'm saying?
[2:01:26] [Applause]
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Right now, I've got stories going
[2:01:29] through my mind, accounts going through
[2:01:30] my mind you wouldn't believe.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; So, I won't tell you.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; I'll close with this.
[2:01:50] For we know Paul said
[2:01:54] that if our earthly house of this
[2:01:57] tabernacle be dissolved,
[2:02:01] we have a building
[2:02:03] of God, a house
[2:02:07] not made with hands, eternal in the
[2:02:10] heavens.
[2:02:15] Are you saved? Are you redeemed people?
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; You are.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know how you got here? You know
[2:02:22] how you got to that state?
[2:02:27] Cuz one descended and came down
[2:02:31] and clothed himself
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; in flesh.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:02:39] and was born like you were born.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; of a woman.
[2:02:45] He clothed
[2:02:47] and God
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; came and dwelt in a building
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; in a house
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; called Jesus Christ.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; And if this body, this house is
[2:03:03] dissolved,
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; you have another house. Are you in the
[2:03:06] heavens?
[2:03:08] And this all ties together now. And the
[2:03:10] and the message that we are preaching,
[2:03:12] the word that we're speaking, and the
[2:03:14] word that we believe is adding to that
[2:03:17] is why we won't go from here naked.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; We will be dressed.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; We will have a house.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; We'll have a tabernacle, whatever you
[2:03:25] want to call it. You have a house now.
[2:03:28] And you move from this house to that
[2:03:29] house.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; And you skipped around the original. You
[2:03:33] came secondarily through a sexual birth,
[2:03:37] but you're having a birth now. And you
[2:03:39] came by a second birth. You've been born
[2:03:41] again
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of God,
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; not through a sexual birth, but by the
[2:03:48] word of God.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the seed of Almighty God
[2:03:53] came out of the mouth of a prophet and
[2:03:55] gave you birth.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you've been born again,
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; not by corruptible seed, which is by the
[2:04:03] natural birth, but by incorruptible
[2:04:05] seed,
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; even the word of God. That's how you're
[2:04:09] born. That's why you're here, sir.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; So, if this house is dissolved,
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; we have another. And it's not that
[2:04:19] that's some pie in the sky a long way.
[2:04:22] You have another.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; It's no one else's. Right.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; You have this body here
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; and God through a process he allowed
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; from your father and your mother you
[2:04:37] came into this life into this house
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham goes into it I
[2:04:45] don't want to be be repeating myself but
[2:04:47] he goes into it in such detail
[2:04:52] especially in things that are here to
[2:04:53] things that are to be and so on and how
[2:04:57] we are moving towards
[2:05:00] the eternal home and another one is
[2:05:04] being made ready for you to step into
[2:05:07] and we have all kinds of questions well
[2:05:09] will it be ready and how is this
[2:05:10] affecting it brother Brandham says in
[2:05:12] another place I just read it I probably
[2:05:14] have the quote here as well saying that
[2:05:17] here if we are in you know if we're not
[2:05:20] formed perfectly we may have an
[2:05:22] affliction he said there'll be no
[2:05:23] affliction over there. I I I don't
[2:05:26] understand it completely.
[2:05:28] It does speak about us losing our
[2:05:30] reward. So, I wouldn't want anybody to
[2:05:32] lose their reward. But it says this,
[2:05:35] "For we know that if our earthly house
[2:05:36] of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have
[2:05:39] a building of God and house not made
[2:05:41] with hands, eternal in the heavens. For
[2:05:44] now, I'm going to take this next verse.
[2:05:46] This is uh 2 Corinthians 5 and 1 and
[2:05:49] two. And the second verse I'm taking
[2:05:51] into four parts or three or four parts.
[2:05:54] For in this we grown.
[2:05:57] In this we grown. Doesn't say in this we
[2:06:01] sit in church and we just are you know
[2:06:03] take this casually. In this we grown.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; This is earnest earnest craving.
[2:06:09] Remember here I spoke a few weeks ago
[2:06:12] said of all those people who came before
[2:06:14] brother Brandham we don't have one who
[2:06:17] say I'm craving I'm groaning for the
[2:06:20] rapture but Apostle Paul is saying it
[2:06:22] here we groan
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; to be clothed upon
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; it would be good for you to come into
[2:06:33] the house of God sir
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; and you can barely move one foot ahead
[2:06:37] of the other groaning.
[2:06:39] I'm desiring. Oh God, take your servant.
[2:06:44] Take your minister. Have him say what I
[2:06:47] need.
[2:06:49] [Music]
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; I don't even know what it is.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; I don't know what my insufficiency is,
[2:06:56] but make it up. Oh God, do in me what I
[2:06:59] need to do.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Grant, oh God, what my theophony is
[2:07:04] calling for, what the unseen realm is
[2:07:06] calling for. cause it to happen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Friends, I trust what I'm saying is
[2:07:12] making sense to you. For in this we
[2:07:14] grown. In this, Apostle Paul says, we
[2:07:18] grown.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; And this is it. Earnestly desiring to be
[2:07:24] clothed upon.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; It's number two. In this we grown in
[2:07:29] this statement. Earnestly desiring
[2:07:33] to be clothed upon.
[2:07:36] Oh God, not that we desire to die.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; We don't desire to do that. And he even
[2:07:42] says that
[2:07:48] with our house
[2:07:50] which is from heaven.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; He he he's already talking about it now.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; With our house which is from heaven,
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; we're hearing from it, friends.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; That's why he would say you're hearing
[2:08:03] from your theophony. Am I getting too
[2:08:05] much swimming water here? Is this all
[2:08:07] right?
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; You're hearing from this this vindicated
[2:08:13] message.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; We have no concept in these puny human
[2:08:17] minds.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; To understand
[2:08:21] the depth of of God's
[2:08:25] uh seriousness about his word.
[2:08:32] Let me just tell you
[2:08:37] what's really in my heart.
[2:08:42] And I hope you don't tire of this,
[2:08:45] but I I have never in all of my life,
[2:08:49] I've never been able to comprehend
[2:08:52] how there's multitudes and tens of
[2:08:54] thousands and millions and millions of
[2:08:56] people, but that pillar of fire
[2:09:01] would not leave that prophet messenger.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; He said he made mistakes, but that
[2:09:09] pillar of fire wouldn't leave him. Amen.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; He had desires. He had cravings. He says
[2:09:16] one place that he wanted to be at the
[2:09:18] altar. He should be at the altar. He
[2:09:19] wanted to be at the altar. Didn't
[2:09:21] change. He get right up in the next
[2:09:23] service and said, "Now, if it would help
[2:09:25] you to believe and he will come." Did he
[2:09:28] ever fail to come? Never.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Never.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; What does that tell me? That tells me
[2:09:34] that just beyond the veil of this site
[2:09:37] was a angel of the Lord, none other than
[2:09:40] the Holy Pence and the Holy Spirit of
[2:09:42] Jesus Christ, ready to come, standing
[2:09:45] there as it were, watching all around
[2:09:47] him to vindicate, to make sure the
[2:09:49] people would believe what he was saying.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; How many times would you ever hear a man
[2:09:56] standing behind the pulpit saying, "Now,
[2:09:58] if he doesn't come now, I'm a false
[2:10:00] prophet."
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; You don't hear that. But he said that
[2:10:03] many times. And did he ever fail to
[2:10:06] come? No, he never failed to come. So if
[2:10:08] he never failed to come, what kind of
[2:10:11] importance should we put to it?
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Why would he do that? Because he knew
[2:10:21] that it would be the words coming from
[2:10:23] this that's going to call you. He's
[2:10:25] going to go searching for that bride.
[2:10:27] He's going to go searching for that
[2:10:29] character. And he's going to find it.
[2:10:34] Amen.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Can you just bear with me another moment
[2:10:37] or two, please?
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[2:10:43] with our house. Our house.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Your house.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; You have another body. It's your house
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; which is from heaven.
[2:11:02] If so be that being clothed,
[2:11:05] listen to the apostle now. If so, if so
[2:11:10] be that being clothed,
[2:11:13] we shall not be found naked.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; I'd like to I thought when I read that
[2:11:20] and put that down again, I'd like to
[2:11:22] preach on that. We shall not be found
[2:11:25] naked.
[2:11:28] Yeah.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; You know, even as humans, it's difficult
[2:11:33] to sometimes speak about this these kind
[2:11:35] of things because there's so much shame
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; attached to it. We see people and they
[2:11:42] dress in a certain way. I don't want to
[2:11:43] even get on to it, but they dress in a
[2:11:45] certain way, you feel sorry for them.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said if their
[2:11:48] grandmother dressed that way, they'd
[2:11:50] have put her in the institution. They'd
[2:11:52] put her in jail. But they dress that
[2:11:53] way, they don't even think. and and they
[2:11:55] go to a place like you go to Hawaii,
[2:11:57] you've been to Hawaii, you go to Hawaii,
[2:11:59] people walk around there and it's it's
[2:12:02] not only a disgrace, it's gross
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; and it's a shame.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; And you you you can just ask yourself,
[2:12:10] would that woman go home and walk down
[2:12:13] the street of their her town in that
[2:12:16] garment or lack of garment? No, she
[2:12:19] wouldn't do it. She'd be horrified. She
[2:12:22] wouldn't even meet the mailman at the at
[2:12:24] the door that way. But they'll because,
[2:12:26] you know, it's this is this is a, you
[2:12:29] know, this is uh Mexico or this is
[2:12:32] Hawaii or this is some grand place and
[2:12:34] and they walk around naked.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; I I have a resentment against Satan for
[2:12:43] taking the beauty spots of this world
[2:12:45] and transforming him into such hell
[2:12:47] holes. He doesn't own that sand. He
[2:12:49] doesn't own that ocean. He doesn't own
[2:12:51] that beauty. He's a robber
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; and I resent it very much. And the meek
[2:12:57] shall inherit the earth.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; You'll have all the beauty spots and
[2:13:02] there'll be none of that wickedness.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; They won't have all these casinos and
[2:13:06] all of this trash. Help me out.
[2:13:10] [Applause]
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; We shall not be found naked.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; For we that are in this tabernacle
[2:13:20] do groan
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; being burdened. Not that we should be
[2:13:25] unclothed. We don't want to die.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be unclothed,
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; but that we be clothed upon with
[2:13:33] mortality.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; That mortality might be swallowed up in
[2:13:37] life.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; So, it is for those people who have a a
[2:13:41] a a vision, I mean, a revelation of of
[2:13:45] what immortality is, truly is. It's not
[2:13:48] what the religious world has said it to
[2:13:50] be. You know, you're going to go up in
[2:13:52] some ladder or go up in some cloud or
[2:13:55] something else. It's things that are
[2:13:56] happening. If that's why the prophet
[2:13:58] would say if the people could only grasp
[2:14:00] what is happening,
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; we shall not be found naked.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; And naked is simply unclad.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, how's it going to be?" Well,
[2:14:15] I don't know. How's it going to be?
[2:14:25] I sat in front of this presence
[2:14:29] and I know exactly
[2:14:31] exactly how the people are feeling
[2:14:35] when brother Brandham would say and you
[2:14:37] can hear him on tape. Do you hear the
[2:14:38] tapes?
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; You hear him say and he generally says
[2:14:43] it quietly.
[2:14:45] You couldn't hide a thing in your life
[2:14:47] right now
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; if you wanted to. You couldn't hide a
[2:14:51] thing. Why? Because he knows it all. No,
[2:14:54] the presence that they came into knows
[2:14:56] it all.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; You know what, friends? I sat there
[2:15:03] and he said, "Brother Eddie, I riding on
[2:15:05] this hill on a horse behind brother
[2:15:08] Southwick and he came to me there and
[2:15:11] that's when I fastened my eye. He fast
[2:15:13] our eyes locked from about this far.
[2:15:18] The scripture that went through my mind
[2:15:20] was
[2:15:22] in Daniel
[2:15:25] when his eyes were as candles
[2:15:29] cuz they weren't sharp, they weren't
[2:15:30] sparkling, they weren't piercing,
[2:15:33] but they were like all knowing
[2:15:36] and like it just bored. And I thought I
[2:15:38] thought instantly in seconds of my life
[2:15:41] from a child
[2:15:43] just a young young child and I knew one
[2:15:46] thing
[2:15:48] and that's exactly what I said within
[2:15:50] myself. I am naked
[2:15:54] in this presence. There isn't a thing.
[2:15:56] There wasn't there wasn't a word
[2:16:00] I could justify anything. I there wasn't
[2:16:03] a belief. There wasn't a doctrine. There
[2:16:05] wasn't anything good. There was nothing
[2:16:08] to say.
[2:16:11] And then he said, and I believe you have
[2:16:13] three questions.
[2:16:15] Oh, I'm so glad.
[2:16:18] He didn't say
[2:16:20] you're an unclean, dirty rat.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; You questioned my m You questioned this
[2:16:26] ministry. You doubted this ministry. You
[2:16:29] said this and you said that. And I I you
[2:16:33] said just a few days ago if brother
[2:16:35] Brandham tries to come to this and tries
[2:16:37] to go around the scripture uh that'll be
[2:16:39] the end of our friendship. That would
[2:16:41] have been true too.
[2:16:44] I had quoted the scripture and Adam knew
[2:16:47] his wife and she conceived and bore a
[2:16:49] son and called his name Cain. For I've
[2:16:51] received a man from the Lord and I
[2:16:53] thought if he tries to go around that
[2:16:55] and escape that and avoid that there'll
[2:16:58] be the end of our friendship. never said
[2:17:00] that. He could have said that. I'm
[2:17:03] saying it to you. Maybe some people will
[2:17:05] abuse that or whatever more. It's out on
[2:17:07] the internet. I don't care. He knew it
[2:17:10] was the truth. God knows it's the truth.
[2:17:12] I know it's the truth.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; But here's the grace of God. Didn't say
[2:17:16] you're a scoundrel. You're filled with
[2:17:19] doubt. You're filled with question. He
[2:17:20] said you have three questions. You want
[2:17:23] to know about the Godhead and you want
[2:17:25] to know about the baptism and you want
[2:17:27] to know about the serpent seed. And I
[2:17:29] said, "That's right.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to have that kind of
[2:17:37] a father?
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly where you're at. He
[2:17:40] knows exactly. He knows. He knows that
[2:17:43] you're here cuz you want God. You want
[2:17:45] him."
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:17:54] Well, brother Bis, would he have those
[2:17:55] kind of questions? You've had those kind
[2:17:57] of questions.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Had all kinds of questions.
[2:18:16] There's a group
[2:18:19] that's found clothed
[2:18:22] and a group that's found naked. Those
[2:18:25] the only two groups we have in the
[2:18:28] scripture.
[2:18:30] And I came here this morning
[2:18:33] to say that
[2:18:35] this wedding garment
[2:18:38] is not something that you're going to
[2:18:40] get and put on there. You you're being
[2:18:42] dressed right now.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; And you want you want something out of
[2:18:47] my heart to you. I would go out to this
[2:18:49] place. I'd find a little place of prayer
[2:18:53] and I'd say, "Father,
[2:18:55] let this vindicated
[2:18:57] message
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; that you spoke
[2:19:02] dress me."
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; I don't even know exactly what I need,
[2:19:06] but when I hear, "Let me be dressed by
[2:19:10] that prophet."
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; Is that too extreme?
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't they think that's all right?
[2:19:16] Dress me and make me ready
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; for what? I don't know what I'm going to
[2:19:21] face tomorrow. Do you know what you're
[2:19:22] going to face? Dress me.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm closing with this.
[2:19:33] Said, "Open up your mind.
[2:19:36] Open up that mind." He said, "That's the
[2:19:38] battleground. There's where the battle
[2:19:40] sets in array right there in the front
[2:19:42] line. your mind. Open it up and say,
[2:19:45] "Every doubt
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; I doubt my doubts."
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. Every doubt,
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; doubt,
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; I doubt my doubts.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; I'm doubting my doubts now.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; I'm believing God's word.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Here I come, Satan.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Something's going to take place.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; I doubt my doubts.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; I doubt my doubts now. Amen.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Brother B talk to the devil. You can
[2:20:15] talk to him.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Hey, Satan, I'm putting you on notice.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; I've doubted my doubts.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; I've doubted them now.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; And something's going to take place.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to sing if we can
[2:20:33] have
[2:20:35] the musicians, please.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:20:55] Hallelujah.
[2:20:58] Would you pray with me?
[2:21:05] Oh God,
[2:21:08] my heart jumps with rejoicing. Lord,
[2:21:12] I just cannot
[2:21:15] escape this sense and this feeling
[2:21:19] because how the enemy
[2:21:21] has tried everything
[2:21:24] and it's failed.
[2:21:26] And we can point our finger at him and
[2:21:28] say, "You're a failure.
[2:21:31] You tried to trip me up. You're a
[2:21:33] failure. I came through.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; You brought all hell against me. I came
[2:21:40] through by the power of God.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; I've been equipped.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; I've been dressed.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've been prepared.
[2:21:50] And nothing can nothing can defeat this
[2:21:53] bride.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Father, I ask that you
[2:21:58] bless this people. We know that we'll
[2:22:00] face battles. We'll know we'll have
[2:22:02] great obstacles. But we thank you for
[2:22:04] the opportunity of proving that you're
[2:22:07] victorious once again.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; You've never known a defeat.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, the
[2:22:17] mighty conqueror.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; How we thank you, Father.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:25] And amen.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:28] Hallelujah.
[2:22:30] Hallelujah.
[2:22:32] Glory to God.
[2:22:37] You might wonder just why I'm lingering
[2:22:40] a wee bit.
[2:22:42] I'm doing it for my own benefit
[2:22:45] as God has been dealing with me since
[2:22:48] last night.
[2:22:50] And and I I I I made a series of notes,
[2:22:53] several pages which I mentioned earlier,
[2:22:56] but my mind is just being captivated
[2:23:01] by this great plan of God trying to
[2:23:07] trying to grasp the depths of it. It is
[2:23:10] so incredible.
[2:23:12] Hallelujah.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:17] I'm going to uh sing in a moment
[2:23:22] uh victory number 32 in the in the book
[2:23:27] and then and then for you that can be
[2:23:29] ready up there I want to sing also
[2:23:31] victory 751 the song
[2:23:34] um
[2:23:42] a statement that really.
[2:23:46] Can you just be alert for a moment?
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; A statement that really
[2:23:52] kind of stunned me last night.
[2:23:55] [Music]
[2:24:00] And a prophet said this word,
[2:24:03] "You became from the attribute
[2:24:07] to the flesh
[2:24:09] to be tempted."
[2:24:12] This was in the great plan of God. You
[2:24:14] came from the attribute.
[2:24:17] You
[2:24:19] each one of us
[2:24:21] are actually an attribute of God. Not
[2:24:24] not just a thought. Now because he said
[2:24:26] a thought is an attribute but you came
[2:24:29] from the attribute. Whatever God had in
[2:24:32] his mind the attribute would speak of a
[2:24:35] whole unit, a whole entity.
[2:24:38] And you came from that.
[2:24:41] And I began to think of this natural
[2:24:43] birth that we had
[2:24:46] and so many things.
[2:24:49] I'm going to take a just I'm just take a
[2:24:51] moment.
[2:24:57] This will help me out. Is that all
[2:24:59] right? You like to help me?
[2:25:05] Lucifer said, "I will ascend."
[2:25:11] God said, "I will descend."
[2:25:15] And they met in Eden.
[2:25:20] [Music]
[2:25:21] And two seeds
[2:25:24] were in Eve at one time.
[2:25:27] [Music]
[2:25:30] One would be a murderer
[2:25:33] and the other is actually the attribute
[2:25:35] of Adam who was the attribute of God.
[2:25:39] And as soon as they issue out in the
[2:25:40] world, they both have minds.
[2:25:44] And the prophet said that the mind was
[2:25:46] selected as the battleground.
[2:25:49] And in the one he contrived away,
[2:25:53] I will kill this one.
[2:25:56] So he tried to slay that attribute.
[2:26:01] You know what this is? This is the
[2:26:03] commencement and the beginning of
[2:26:05] redemption, the plan of redemption. And
[2:26:07] this is a great warfare
[2:26:10] taking place between the two. And the
[2:26:13] one is killed and God replaces him. I'm
[2:26:15] going to just go quickly.
[2:26:18] And then
[2:26:20] we have the same thing with Esau and
[2:26:22] Jacob in the same womb. in the same womb
[2:26:28] is one that God hates and he's evil and
[2:26:30] one that God loves. And they both come
[2:26:33] out into the world.
[2:26:36] And then I want to just go quickly to
[2:26:39] Calvary.
[2:26:41] Brother Brandham said to me, and I it
[2:26:43] means more at this very moment just now.
[2:26:46] He said, "Everyone thinks there were
[2:26:48] three at Calvary that died, but he said
[2:26:50] there were four."
[2:26:52] And he said, "Jesus." and he took one
[2:26:54] thief to heaven and the son of predition
[2:26:58] Judas and he took one to hell.
[2:27:02] So there's always been twins and here
[2:27:03] they were now on earth at the same time.
[2:27:08] Son of God,
[2:27:10] son of predition at the same moment.
[2:27:15] And they hung Jesus on a tree. But they
[2:27:18] didn't hang Jesus on the tree. He said,
[2:27:21] "I
[2:27:22] I lay it down. I go." So he went and
[2:27:27] essentially gave himself to be hung. And
[2:27:31] Judas, he went and hung himself on a
[2:27:33] tree.
[2:27:35] The Bible says Matthew 27.
[2:27:39] And I begin to see this great conflict
[2:27:41] taking place. God and Satan on the
[2:27:45] earth. And I had to I had to just get
[2:27:47] this out. I'm just at the very
[2:27:48] beginning. And that's where I'm going to
[2:27:50] kind of leave it. See that? That's why
[2:27:54] God
[2:27:55] even would become a living cell in the
[2:27:58] womb of a woman and burst forth in
[2:28:02] childbirth
[2:28:04] because he came, he descended and
[2:28:06] descended to that place because that's
[2:28:09] what his enemy did
[2:28:12] in Eden. And one was a creator and one
[2:28:16] was a perverter.
[2:28:18] And those two lives came along right
[2:28:21] here today. Both of those forces, just
[2:28:24] those two forces.
[2:28:27] And one is a doubter and a unbeliever of
[2:28:30] God's word. And the other was not only a
[2:28:33] believer of the word, but the word
[2:28:34] himself.
[2:28:36] And you have been called.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; That's the one that came and stood on
[2:28:41] the platform.
[2:28:43] That's the one that revealed the secrets
[2:28:45] of the heart. That's the one that called
[2:28:48] you and has has has has almost negated
[2:28:51] your natural birth and has brought you
[2:28:54] from the attribute to the flesh. Yes,
[2:28:58] sir.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; To be tempted and to allow his word
[2:29:01] here, get get it, please. I'm finishing
[2:29:03] to allow his word, the word that has
[2:29:06] been doubted through centuries by those
[2:29:09] that would be doubting. But this is what
[2:29:11] separates the this what separates his
[2:29:14] children from the others. Not a bunch of
[2:29:16] good deeds. Nothing to do with that. The
[2:29:19] separation is that one believed what he
[2:29:22] said.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; One loved what he said
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; and that was his children.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're here in the womb
[2:29:31] of the earth,
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; the same womb. And here's a great
[2:29:34] struggle. But there's a group of people.
[2:29:37] And I trust. I know. That's why you're
[2:29:40] here. That's why I'm here. I want to say
[2:29:43] to the people, I want to say to the
[2:29:44] internet, I want to say to you that come
[2:29:47] here to church. I'm only here for one
[2:29:49] reason. To attest to this one testimony.
[2:29:52] I believe that word that came not just
[2:29:55] out of here, but we want to have it.
[2:29:57] Indeed,
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; not a not a lip service, but indeed. We
[2:30:02] believe it. Yeah.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; And I want to assure you friends, you
[2:30:06] have a victory sir.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; You are assured victory
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; because God has assigned conquering a
[2:30:14] conquering power to this word and it
[2:30:17] will never
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; never be defeated.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; It's not just songs about the blood and
[2:30:22] songs about that, but this word
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; if I can emphasize it. This word which
[2:30:28] he vindicated and vindicated and proved
[2:30:31] it and proven it. over and over again.
[2:30:34] He did that so that we would be assured.
[2:30:37] I will never leave it.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; We say I'll never leave you nor forsake
[2:30:42] you. That's fine. That's part. But it's
[2:30:46] not us in this natural that he's so in
[2:30:49] love with. But he's in love with those
[2:30:51] who have loved his word. And we've
[2:30:53] embraced his word. We've embraced
[2:30:55] Christ.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:59] [Applause]
[2:31:01] And he's prepared a place for us. Amen.
[2:31:05] Oh, victory in Jesus.
[2:31:09] V. No. Victory. Victory. The one we had
[2:31:12] over 32.
[2:31:16] 32, please. Victory.
[2:31:20] Victory. Let's all stand over all the
[2:31:25] powers of darkness.
[2:31:29] When the battles go in the rain, angels
[2:31:33] help us in the rain. And God fights for
[2:31:36] those who pray. Victory.
[2:31:40] Oh, victory.
[2:31:43] Victory
[2:31:46] over all the power of darkness. Victory.
[2:31:52] When the battles in array, he will help
[2:31:56] us to see the praise and God fights for
[2:31:59] those who pray. Victory.
[2:32:03] And then I like to sing this other song
[2:32:05] also that we had victory hallelujah.

[2:32:10] brought.

[2:35:19] You believe in victory?
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might say, "Brother Ed, why do
[2:35:25] you put so much emphasis?"
[2:35:28] Because as time goes on, I see less
[2:35:31] emphasis put on the messenger.
[2:35:36] And the message of this congregation, as
[2:35:38] long as I have strength, will be
[2:35:41] emphasis on that vindicated voice.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.

[2:39:17] supper." Hallelujah.

[2:39:28] my house, but I'm going to pray that God
[2:39:30] makes him sit right next to me at the
[2:39:32] marriage supper.
