[0:00] i think of a video clip get a video clip
[0:01] ready brother joe all right if you could
[0:03] just have that queued up
[0:05] it's a
[0:06] testimony that we wanted to share with
[0:09] you some of you are
[0:10] a little bit familiar but
[0:12] i think this will be special for a few
[0:14] of you but
[0:15] since 2019 my wife and i uh
[0:19] sister early and sister elena and myself
[0:22] had
[0:23] miscarriage after miscarriage not very
[0:25] many people really knew about it they
[0:27] were all
[0:28] in the first trimester and uh
[0:31] some early on and so it's it's sometimes
[0:32] just a part of life and so you move on
[0:34] but it kept happening
[0:36] and there's you know we're very blessed
[0:37] to have the son and daughter that we
[0:39] have but there was a desire in our heart
[0:40] you know for
[0:41] another child and um in
[0:45] i believe it was late 2019 or early 2020
[0:48] she had a miscarriage that was really
[0:49] quite hard on her body
[0:52] and um
[0:53] and so it became kind of a real fearful
[0:55] thing for her and um fast forward now
[0:59] till
[0:59] 2021 and in august late july and august
[1:03] of just last year
[1:05] um
[1:06] we found out she was expecting again and
[1:08] so we're excited but there's that that
[1:10] fear now because now there's been a bit
[1:12] of a pattern for a couple years
[1:14] and
[1:16] she
[1:17] had another miscarriage and lost the
[1:18] baby and this one was was quite severe
[1:21] and there came a point where
[1:23] she finally called her doctor and the
[1:25] doctor said you should go to the
[1:26] emergency room just because of how how
[1:28] much of the hemorrhaging that was taking
[1:30] place
[1:31] and elena was just so weak she's like i
[1:32] don't want to go to the hospital so we
[1:34] had prayer and the lord stopped bleeding
[1:37] and
[1:38] she was out for eight to ten days about
[1:41] ten days she couldn't really do anything
[1:43] and so i was in full-time school working
[1:45] trying to take care of the kids it was a
[1:46] a challenging couple weeks you know and
[1:48] she feels
[1:50] um
[1:51] you know like she's not able to do
[1:52] anything it's very hard for a mother but
[1:53] she was just really weak and really
[1:55] discouraged and there's all the physical
[1:56] things happening as well it was a very
[1:58] challenging time and that took us right
[2:00] up to camp in fact when we came to
[2:02] summer camp it was right out of that and
[2:04] i i had messaged brother michael it's
[2:06] like if i don't seem very excited about
[2:08] all the camped prep it's because i am so
[2:10] tired and like this is where we are and
[2:12] i told brother michael what was going on
[2:13] just so we had a heads up like this is
[2:15] what we've been going through the last
[2:16] couple weeks it was the ten days before
[2:18] camp
[2:19] and uh poor elena was just so tired and
[2:21] and just her body recovering and uh all
[2:24] the emotional side of it as well so we
[2:26] came into camp very tired
[2:28] and uh just you know still trusting the
[2:30] lord but just disappointed again and
[2:32] having this was our fourth or fifth at
[2:33] this point
[2:34] and um
[2:36] at the very end of camp brother wayne
[2:38] lawson this will be special brother
[2:39] louise and sister grace as well
[2:41] at the very end of camp on his sunday
[2:43] morning he proceeds to share a bunch of
[2:45] testimonies i'm sure a number of you
[2:47] remember he told testimony after
[2:48] testimony told the testimony of the
[2:49] sister who was crippled and she came up
[2:51] to give a testimony when she reached for
[2:53] the microphone he said and with these
[2:54] eyes i saw her hand straighten out
[2:56] and then after that the last two
[2:58] testimonies that he shares
[3:01] were about the lord granting children to
[3:03] people who had not been able to have
[3:04] children previously and so i have that
[3:07] testimony clip it's about five or sorry
[3:08] the uh yeah testimony that's about five
[3:10] minutes but i thought it would be
[3:11] important so we're going to share it
[3:12] with you
[3:14] share a little bit of the testimony with
[3:15] you we could cue that up brother
[3:18] right in my house my
[3:20] my son zechariah got married to a lovely
[3:22] young lady named hannah anna carter from
[3:24] brother paula fontaine some of you might
[3:26] know her
[3:28] wasn't long after they were married they
[3:29] decide they want to have a child which
[3:31] would be my first grandchild
[3:33] and i was happy for them
[3:36] my my goal in life is to have a pile of
[3:40] grandkids hanging around the house
[3:42] that's like my ultimate goal
[3:45] seriously so i was so happy to hear the
[3:47] news
[3:48] and then she
[3:50] expected we all was rejoicing lost the
[3:52] baby
[3:53] that was a birthday
[3:55] a little while later they
[3:57] worked up the nerve to try again
[3:59] she got expected lost the baby
[4:02] went to the doctors they said well we're
[4:04] not sure what's really wrong
[4:05] some of our people around here begin to
[4:07] say well there's a there's a lineage
[4:09] that we're from and some of them is not
[4:11] able to bear children because of certain
[4:13] diseases strike their body and they they
[4:15] they're not going to be able to have
[4:16] them
[4:17] so her and zachariah were
[4:19] were in labor wandering praying asking
[4:21] god
[4:23] well about this same season brother
[4:25] erickson had ron spencer to come for our
[4:27] total meetings and it may have been may
[4:29] i don't remember we had him twice that
[4:30] year
[4:32] and in the end of the service we were
[4:33] having a prayer line
[4:35] and and when brother ron started praying
[4:37] he asked me to join him and i come and
[4:38] stood there with him and while we were
[4:40] praying for people all of a sudden
[4:43] zechariah and anna come on my heart
[4:45] and i said lord i want to see him have

[5:03] brother ron goes to pray for him puts
[5:05] his hand on and begins to pray and steps

[7:44] i'm showing you that this message is
[7:47] real
[7:49] i was preaching in a meeting one time
[7:51] over in david versus and the young man's
[7:53] a pastor now he meant his wife sister
[7:55] stephanie they were sitting in the
[7:57] meeting and i was preaching right along
[8:00] and i was preaching all of a sudden that
[8:02] inspiration comes on me and i point out
[8:04] at sister stephanie and i said listen
[8:06] god change your body if he needs to
[8:08] god changed mary god changed hannah god
[8:11] gave those babies god's able to do
[8:13] whatever to cause something to happen
[8:16] hey man you can have that baby if you
[8:17] can believe it i didn't even know she's
[8:19] praying for a baby
[8:21] ten months later she comes to arkansas
[8:23] walks in the church she said here
[8:25] brother wayne's that baby i said i
[8:27] didn't even know you were wanting to
[8:28] baby she said do you not remember
[8:30] pointing me out and telling me that god
[8:33] would give me the desires of my heart if
[8:35] i could i said no i don't even remember
[8:36] it because see god can speak to a man
[8:40] god can speak to a woman when the
[8:42] speaker don't even know what is being
[8:44] asked for but god remains to be god let
[8:48] me tell you something he's still god
[8:55] amen
[8:57] so you can sit me and see me at the
[8:59] piano sitting there looking really
[9:01] awkward because there's a mess of
[9:02] emotions going on there i'm like this
[9:04] man has no idea what we've just come
[9:06] through
[9:07] so after the meetings were over i
[9:09] tracked him down in the dining hall and
[9:10] i said brother wayne lawson you don't
[9:12] know this but my wife and i just came
[9:13] off of our fourth miscarriage and this
[9:15] was a real hard one and he said anytime
[9:17] i feel led of the lord to share that he
[9:20] said i i know that there's a reason for
[9:22] it but while i was sitting there at the
[9:23] piano i'm not just saying thank you lord
[9:25] this is so
[9:26] timely i just so appreciate it and the
[9:28] holy spirit spoke
[9:31] he said you will have a son and name him
[9:32] samuel
[9:34] and on may 9th
[9:37] hallelujah
[9:54] yes
[9:58] praise the lord
[10:01] thank you lord jesus
[10:04] so may 9th
[10:06] little samuel jaron came he was perfect
[10:08] in every way the doctor says this is as
[10:10] perfect as a baby can be
[10:12] and we're just so blessed and so
[10:13] grateful i just want to share that with
[10:16] you there's been a reason we delayed the
[10:17] baby announcement we wanted to be able
[10:18] to share the back story behind it and
[10:20] just give glory to the lord for what
[10:22] he's done when god speaks things happen
[10:25] amen
