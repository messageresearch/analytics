[3:46] Father, we look forward to coming up to
[3:48] your house, Lord Jesus.
[3:51] And Lord, it's just a few more days that
[3:53] we'll labor for you on this side, Lord.
[3:56] And then we'll come up to your house,
[3:58] Lord Jesus,
[4:00] and you'll wipe away our tears, Lord. We
[4:03] thank you for your grace this morning,
[4:05] for your mercy, Lord.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus.
[4:10] Hallelujah.
[4:12] Amen. I have one prayer request here
[4:15] this morning. Going to ask Brother Norm
[4:17] Wood if you'll come and open the service
[4:18] in a word of prayer this morning. It's a
[4:21] prayer request. Uh, Sister Joan
[4:23] Tomlinson
[4:25] fell down on Saturday. Thank God she
[4:27] only bruised her face. No breaking of
[4:29] her bones. Please continue to remember
[4:31] her in your prayer this morning.
[4:35] And if you have any other needs this
[4:37] morning, let's hold them before the Lord
[4:38] as Brother Norm comes. Come, brother
[4:40] Norm. Amen.
[4:42] [Music]
[4:44] Amen.
[4:49] God bless you.
[4:52] So we just bow.
[4:54] Father, we just so thankful Lord that we
[4:56] can gather again in your presence Lord
[4:59] with brothers and sisters like precious
[5:01] faith
[5:03] Lord after being away again. It's just
[5:06] so precious Lord to again see the faces
[5:10] of all the saints Lord gather around
[5:11] your word. And sometimes Father we
[5:14] forget what it's really like to be
[5:16] around our brothers and sisters. And
[5:18] father, we just thank you for that
[5:20] privilege, Lord, that we as a group can
[5:22] gather again. And Father, hear the word.
[5:25] And Father, we just
[5:28] want to thank you for just being with
[5:30] us, being in our midst, and give us the
[5:32] wisdom and leadership that you give us
[5:34] each day, Father, and watching over us,
[5:36] protecting us, Lord. Even though we
[5:38] don't recognize it sometimes, we pray
[5:41] you'd forgive us for that. And just pray
[5:43] you'd continue to be in our midst.
[5:46] We pray for our sister Joan now, Lord,
[5:48] that you would continue to undertake for
[5:49] her. And Father, that these bruises
[5:52] would not develop into anything, but she
[5:54] would just get over it completely and
[5:57] just be well. Father, any other needs
[6:00] that would be in the body that you would
[6:01] undertake and minister those needs.
[6:03] Father, there may be those that couldn't
[6:05] make it this morning. May you just be
[6:07] with them and reach down into their
[6:08] hearts. Be with them. Pray you'd be with
[6:11] our brother now as he brings the word
[6:13] and just anoint him and direct him with
[6:15] your Holy Spirit, Father. And may you
[6:17] just help us, Lord, to be able to
[6:19] receive that word and hear what you're
[6:21] saying. Just let it sink deep into our
[6:23] hearts and be with us now. We pray in
[6:25] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[6:30] Brother Nor. Amen. Turn around, shake
[6:33] someone's hand, welcoming him into the
[6:35] house of the Lord this morning.
[6:37] Amen.
[6:39] He always does this thing when you turn
[6:40] around and shake a saint's hand. Always
[6:42] brings a smile. Amen. God bless. Amen.
[6:46] Have you take your seats? Amen.
[6:49] Amen. I have a few announcements this
[6:51] morning.
[6:53] So, I'm going to wait till you're seated

[9:48] fall, refusing to hear the word of God

[10:57] gone. Round and around the world they
[11:02] sent feeding the sheep. The word of God
[11:08] that is so pure.
[11:12] Stay with the tapes. The prophet has
[11:15] said, "Don't add to anything I have
[11:20] said. Stay with the word given to you
[11:26] for this last days.
[11:30] There's food in the storehouse.

[12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you thankful there's plenty
[13:00] of food?
[13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's sing that chorus.
[13:04] Can't you see why I'm happy as Sister
[13:06] Jabber comes singing for us this
[13:08] morning?
[13:10] Can't you see
[13:14] why
[13:15] I'm so happy
[13:20] I accepted
[13:23] the word
[13:25] of the Lord?
[13:30] The revealer
[13:34] that was spoken
[13:39] by the prophet
[13:42] on
[13:43] it.
[13:47] [Music]
[14:02] I've truly known the good life
[14:06] filled with family and friends.
[14:13] I've been blessed with more than my
[14:17] share.
[14:22] But in the heart of my heart,
[14:27] I know there's more for me.
[14:33] So much more than this faded world I'm
[14:38] in.
[14:42] It's Jesus
[14:45] I really want to see.
[14:52] It's Jesus
[14:54] I really want to see.
[15:02] The more I see of this life,
[15:07] the less it means to me.
[15:11] And it's Jesus
[15:15] I really want to see.
[15:22] I've been a lot of places
[15:26] and I've known the great and small.
[15:32] I've seen the grand and noble works of
[15:37] man.
[15:41] Yet with all of my good fortune,
[15:46] my heart is sinking still.
[15:51] Oh, I just can't
[15:54] deny the longing there.
[16:00] It's Jesus
[16:03] I really want to see.
[16:10] It's Jesus
[16:12] I really want to see.
[16:20] The more I see of this world,
[16:25] the less it means to me.
[16:29] And it's Jesus
[16:32] I really want to see.
[16:39] It's Jesus
[16:41] I really want to see.
[16:48] It's Jesus
[16:51] I really want to see.
[16:58] The more I see of this world,
[17:03] the less it means to me.
[17:07] And it's Jesus
[17:10] I really want to see.
[17:17] It's Jesus
[17:20] I really want to see.
[17:29] [Applause]
[17:35] That's your desire this morning.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; I believe we'll see him in his word this
[17:39] morning. That's where we'll look for
[17:40] him. Amen. And in one another. Amen.
[17:44] Let's stand together as we get ready to
[17:45] turn to the word this morning. And I
[17:48] want to sing, of course, I can almost
[17:49] see the lights of that city. I see them
[17:52] gathering around the great throne. Now,
[17:55] I have to tell you about this song.
[17:56] There's only one way to sing this song.
[17:58] That's with your eyes closed and your
[18:00] hands raised. And just imagine, you
[18:02] know, have you ever been traveling and
[18:03] you've been a long way from home and you
[18:05] see the glow of the city way off and
[18:07] you're thinking, "I'm almost home."
[18:09] That's where we are this morning. I can
[18:11] almost see the lights of that city. I
[18:13] see them gathering around that great
[18:15] white throne. Amen. Let's sing it
[18:17] together.
[18:20] [Music]
[18:22] I can almost
[18:25] [Music]
[18:27] see the lights
[18:29] on that city. I see them gathering
[18:34] all around the great white road.
[18:40] to faith
[18:42] in my Savior and his wonderful
[18:48] love. Well, I can almost see the light
[18:54] fall.
[18:58] John tells
[19:00] of the city that he saw
[19:05] coming down
[19:07] where no
[19:09] for death
[19:12] will be known.
[19:16] And someday
[19:18] we will go there through his marvelous
[19:23] grace forever live in the heavenly
[19:30] home.
[19:31] [Music]
[19:33] Well, I can almost
[19:38] see the lights
[19:40] of that city. I see them gathering
[19:45] all around the great white
[19:50] [Music]
[19:54] in my savior and his wonderful
[19:59] love. Oh, I can almost see the light
[20:05] fall.
[20:06] [Music]
[20:09] Well, sometimes
[20:11] when I'm burdened
[20:14] and my cross is hard to bear and oh,
[20:19] Satan, he tries to deal
[20:23] my
[20:27] will. I just look unto Jesus.
[20:32] He is standing
[20:34] close by and once again
[20:38] his great light are shining through.
[20:45] Oh, I can almost
[20:49] see the lights
[20:52] on that city. I see the gathering
[20:56] all around the great white ro
[21:02] [Music]
[21:05] my savior
[21:07] and his wonderful
[21:10] love when I can almost see the light
[21:16] of
[21:20] well sometimes
[21:22] when I'm burdened and my cross seems
[21:27] hard to bear
[21:29] and go Satan. He tries to dim
[21:33] my view.
[21:38] I just look unto Jesus.
[21:42] He is standing
[21:44] close by. And once again
[21:49] his great light shine through.
[21:55] And I
[21:58] almost
[22:00] see the light
[22:02] on the city. I see
[22:07] all around the great ro
[22:11] [Music]
[22:16] my
[22:18] [Music]
[22:29] [Music]
[22:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[22:33] That's what's nice to have in our
[22:34] vision.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Lights of home.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:40] Well, God bless you. I'd like to greet
[22:42] you all in the name of our Lord Jesus
[22:44] Christ, those that are present and those
[22:47] that are
[22:49] far away, wherever they are, wherever
[22:52] they're streaming. We just here right
[22:54] after the service people are uh writing
[22:59] in email or phoning mostly email and
[23:03] just saying how how much they appreciate
[23:06] being able to join with with you and
[23:11] they ask about different ones and
[23:12] different ones who perhaps sang or
[23:14] whatever more and where they're sitting.
[23:16] And so I just want to greet all that are
[23:20] streaming also in the name of the Lord
[23:22] Jesus Christ. Won't it be wonderful
[23:25] &gt;&gt; at that ultimate final gathering
[23:28] and we won't be you know leaving church
[23:31] as such and going our own directions but
[23:34] we'll be
[23:36] gathered forever together.
[23:40] Amen.
[23:41] Now I just want to make a couple
[23:43] comments before we read. We're going to
[23:46] sing another chorus song and chorus,
[23:51] but uh I see that the seats are pretty
[23:54] well full, but if you want to move and
[23:56] get a little bit closer, it'll be fine.
[23:58] I I've got a lot of material on the
[24:00] slides today, and I I believe that most
[24:03] of you can see. I try to make the uh uh
[24:06] my printing large so you can follow it,
[24:09] but it'll be very important to follow.
[24:12] And um so I just want you to uh you know
[24:16] be able to Satan has fought this uh this
[24:19] message. He has really really fought it
[24:22] and uh in in a in a in a just a literal
[24:26] way. you know, I I got in into the study
[24:30] and the brothers always ask for, you
[24:32] know, the title of the message and the
[24:33] scriptures of the people are streaming
[24:35] can also follow along and and there's
[24:39] some very very striking things that
[24:41] brother Brandham has said and striking
[24:43] things that Apostle Paul said and I
[24:46] wanted those highlighted
[24:48] and uh my printer just decided not to
[24:51] print the red part.
[24:54] So, so you know what I have to do? I
[24:56] have to run back to the study. And God
[24:58] bless brother Aaron. He said, "You all
[25:00] right?" And I said, "Well, I have to
[25:01] write all this by hand." And I was just
[25:04] about done. And I thought, "You devil,
[25:06] uh, you know, I'm just going to preach
[25:08] that much harder. I'm just going to I'm
[25:10] going to have the people pray." And
[25:12] that's why I'm saying this to you. And
[25:14] what I want you to do when we have
[25:16] prayer before we come to the word, I
[25:18] would ask you specifically
[25:21] if you would pray for yourself and pray
[25:24] that God will give you the spirit of
[25:26] revelation and that you'll pray for me
[25:30] and pray that God will give me the
[25:33] freedom to speak and I believe we'll
[25:36] have a wonderful time in his presence.
[25:39] Amen.
[25:41] Uh, I just like to sing the last verse.
[25:44] I believe it's the last verse of blessed
[25:46] assurance. It's as because it was coming
[25:48] to me almost in my sleep this morning.
[25:51] Perfect submission.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; All is at rest. I and my savior.
[25:59] So wonderfully blessed. So let's sing
[26:02] that together, would you please?
[26:04] [Music]
[26:08] Perfect.
[26:14] All is at rest.
[26:20] I in my Savior
[26:25] and so happy and blessed.
[26:33] and waiting
[26:36] [Music]
[26:43] with his.
[26:49] [Music]
[26:54] This is my story.
[27:00] This is my song
[27:05] praising my
[27:09] [Music]
[27:10] all day long.
[27:16] This is my soul.
[27:21] This is my song.
[27:26] Praising my Savior
[27:32] all the day long.
[27:37] Let's just join our hearts together in
[27:39] prayer
[27:41] and do pray. God grant to me the spirit
[27:47] of revelation.
[27:49] May the Holy Spirit, Father, I'm praying
[27:53] that as each one enters into prayer and
[27:55] they express it by speaking to you now,
[27:59] we're in prayer. And this is the house
[28:01] of prayer. You have called it that. We
[28:05] call it a sanctuary, but it's a house of
[28:07] prayer. It's a house of correction. It's
[28:10] a house of comfort. It's a house of
[28:12] edifying. It's a house where the Holy
[28:15] Spirit, Lord, will come to the people
[28:18] and do your office work in each of our
[28:21] lives. I'm praying, oh God, that you
[28:24] will take the speaker into your hand, oh
[28:28] God, into your supreme control, oh God,
[28:32] and you will bind the enemy which so
[28:36] wants to hinder your word. I pray that
[28:39] you'll release with a mighty release, oh
[28:41] God, the spirit of God upon the people,
[28:45] and take the word dividing it to each
[28:48] individual, Lord, that it might just be
[28:51] planted deep within our hearts. Father,
[28:54] you did not send us messenger in vain.
[28:56] You sent the prophet of God that he
[28:59] might speak what we need to hear. Oh,
[29:02] bless our precious loved ones and
[29:04] friends, oh God, that are in the
[29:06] different countries and streaming right
[29:08] at this moment. For some, it's evening
[29:10] and for others it's afternoon. But Lord,
[29:14] we know that we've entered into a
[29:16] morning time. It's good morning to the
[29:18] bride. Lord, I pray that you'll bless
[29:21] the bride of Jesus Christ in your
[29:24] wonderful and glorious name. And may the
[29:26] name of Jesus Christ be glorified. I
[29:29] pray. Amen.
[29:32] Amen.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be reading out of uh uh
[29:38] Romans the 11th chapter.
[29:42] And uh when we're done reading, keep
[29:45] your Bible if you would open because
[29:48] I'll have you have your seats then. And
[29:51] I'm going to put certain scriptures out
[29:54] of Romans 11 on the screen because I
[29:57] just put them in a certain I put them in
[30:00] a certain order and I just want to read
[30:03] them in that continuity of how uh uh in
[30:08] in order to help the uh help us to have
[30:12] our thoughts together this morning.
[30:16] I'll read from Romans 11
[30:20] and we'll start at verse 26 down to 33.
[30:25] And so all Israel shall be saved as it
[30:28] is written, there shall come out of Zion
[30:31] the deliverer, and shall turn away
[30:34] ungodliness from Jacob. For this is my
[30:37] covenant unto them when I shall take
[30:39] away their sins. As concerning the
[30:42] gospel, they are enemies for your sakes,
[30:46] but as touching the election, they are
[30:48] beloved for the Father's sake. For the
[30:51] gifts and calling of God, are without
[30:54] repentance. Oh, the depth of the riches
[30:56] both of the wisdom and knowledge of God.
[30:59] How unsearchable are his judgments and
[31:03] his ways past finding out. Amen. May God
[31:07] bless his word to our hearts. as you
[31:09] have your seats and you'll keep your
[31:12] Bibles now open and ready.
[31:17] We are all very familiar with this
[31:21] scripture
[31:23] uh and brother Brandham quotes it many
[31:26] many times
[31:29] for the gifts and calling of God are
[31:32] without repentance. And I'm going to
[31:36] dwell very much on the calling of God.
[31:39] And it will come from some very
[31:40] different and strange perhaps directions
[31:43] for you. But think of it now, the
[31:46] calling of God. That's not one person
[31:49] calling to another, but it's the calling
[31:52] of God. God doing the calling. And then
[31:55] we could ask right away, who is he
[31:58] calling to or what is he calling to?
[32:02] uh because uh you know all nature
[32:06] the Bible even says that uh all all all
[32:09] natures there's no sound without
[32:11] significance.
[32:13] So, and then when God was speaking to
[32:15] Job, he asked him about the animal
[32:18] kingdom and the life and he said, "Do do
[32:20] you, you know, when the young welps and
[32:23] the lions and so on and when the birds
[32:26] and he spoke of different creatures, do
[32:28] you hear them? Do you know what they're
[32:30] saying?" And and Job was so he was
[32:33] confounded.
[32:35] He because he doesn't know what these
[32:37] things are. But all of this all of these
[32:40] sounds of even of the creatures, God
[32:43] knows exactly what they're saying.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; And he knows what the what the sound is
[32:49] all about.
[32:51] So the gifts and the calling of God are
[32:54] without repentance. I want to first just
[32:57] set the stage a wee bit that I'd like
[33:01] now to put that scripture into the
[33:04] context of where it is in the scripture
[33:07] because the apostle Paul even from
[33:10] chapter 10 of you don't have to turn to
[33:12] it but even from chapter 10 now this is
[33:14] just set having the setting he starts
[33:18] out with chapter 10 he says brethren my
[33:21] heart's desire and prayer to God for
[33:24] Israel
[33:25] is that they might be saved. Now, so
[33:28] he's he's on to he's on to the people of
[33:31] Israel that they were the called of God.
[33:34] They were the elect of God. And then he
[33:36] comes on into chapter 11.
[33:40] And uh he begins in chapter 11 by by
[33:44] saying, I say then hath God cast away
[33:47] his people. This is the context. Are the
[33:50] people of God cast away? Uh, God forbid,
[33:55] for I also am an Israelite. And so I'm
[33:59] going to have you read some of this with
[34:01] me.
[34:05] Hath God cast away his people? God
[34:08] forbid. For I also am an Israelite of
[34:12] the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of
[34:14] Benjamin.
[34:16] God hath not cast away his people which
[34:19] he forneew. So now he has a reason for
[34:22] saying that, you know, is is this all
[34:25] all that has transpired
[34:28] and now the Jewish people have rejected
[34:31] Jesus Christ. He's just been crucified
[34:34] not that long before and and they've
[34:37] rejected him and and uh uh Paul knows
[34:42] exactly the scripture that because they
[34:44] have rejected him but he's wanting to
[34:46] bring has God cast them away uh those
[34:50] that he forneew
[34:52] and I'm going to five even so then at
[34:55] this present time also there is a
[34:57] remnant according to the election of
[35:00] grace. Right.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; What then? Uh, Israel hath not obtained
[35:07] that which he seeketh for, but the
[35:10] election hath obtained it, and the rest
[35:14] were blinded. According, as it is
[35:17] written, God hath given them the spirit
[35:20] of slumber, eyes that they should not
[35:23] see, and ears that they should not hear
[35:26] unto this day. So now this is the reason
[35:29] that it appears as though they've been
[35:31] cast off because God has given them the
[35:34] eyes of slumber that they should not
[35:36] see.
[35:39] I say then, have they stumbled that they
[35:42] should fall? God forbid, but rather
[35:46] through their fall salvation is come
[35:49] unto the Gentiles for to provoke them to
[35:53] jealousy.
[35:55] Now if the fall of them be the riches of
[35:58] the world and the diminishing of them
[36:03] the riches of the Gentiles, how much
[36:05] more their fullness? I want to I'm going
[36:09] to take a portion of this service today
[36:11] to speak of their diminishing the
[36:13] diminishing of the Jews which all had a
[36:18] part of bringing uh bringing the gospel
[36:22] uh to us.
[36:25] For if the casting away, see now he
[36:27] spoke of the diminishing of them. He
[36:29] speaks of them having stumbled and and
[36:32] fell and and being cast off. But has God
[36:35] cast them away? For if the casting away
[36:37] of them be the reconciling of the world,
[36:41] what shall the receiving of them be but
[36:44] life from the dead? For if the first
[36:47] fruit be holy, the lump is also holy.
[36:50] And if the root be holy, so are the
[36:53] branches.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; But if some of the branches were broken
[36:58] off, now he's on the same theme. They
[37:00] stumbled, they fell, they were cast off,
[37:03] now he's on the branches. The branches
[37:05] have been broken. And he's still
[37:07] speaking about the nation. He's still
[37:09] keeping the same theme. If the branches
[37:11] be broken off, and thou us Gentiles
[37:14] being a wild olive tree, were grafted in
[37:18] among among them, and with them
[37:21] partakers of the root and the fatness of
[37:23] the of the olive tree.
[37:26] And they also, if they abide not still
[37:30] in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for
[37:34] God is able to graft them in again. For
[37:37] I would not, brethren, that you should
[37:39] be ignorant of this mystery, lest you
[37:42] should be wise in your own conceits,
[37:45] that blindness in part is happen to
[37:48] Israel, until the fullness of the
[37:51] Gentiles become in.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; And so all Israel shall be saved, as it
[37:57] is written, there shall come out of Zion
[38:01] the deliverer, and shall turn away
[38:03] ungodliness from Jacob. For this is my
[38:07] covenant unto them, when I shall take
[38:10] away their sins, as concerning the
[38:13] gospel, they are enemies for your sakes.
[38:17] But as touching the election, they are
[38:19] beloved for the Father's sake. For the
[38:23] gifts and calling of God are without
[38:25] repentance. Now, isn't that a little
[38:27] different slant for many because we just
[38:30] have referred to, well, the gifts and
[38:32] calling of God are are without
[38:35] repentance and a prophet. He He's a
[38:38] prophet because he's born that way. And
[38:40] the ministry are are sent and they have
[38:43] they are born that way. And we all uh we
[38:46] all have our gifts and our talents and
[38:49] we're born that way. And God's not going
[38:51] to take them back for the gifts and
[38:53] calling of God. Now, the calling of God
[38:57] on Israel, Apostle Paul is speaking of
[39:00] the nation of the people of Israel.
[39:03] They've stumbled, they fell, they've
[39:05] been broken off, they've rejected, and
[39:07] all of these things. Has God cast them
[39:09] away? Has he done? No. He's saying
[39:12] because the gifts and the calling of
[39:14] God. So now God is calling to something
[39:17] that even is the Jewish people or Israel
[39:21] themselves don't understand. I will
[39:24] bring it down right to ourselves uh
[39:27] individually.
[39:28] We have certain
[39:31] spiritual
[39:33] we might call them desires.
[39:36] We have some spiritual ambition. We have
[39:39] some spiritual hunger. Blessed are they
[39:42] that hunger and thirst after. We have
[39:45] spiritual cravings. We have spiritual
[39:49] yearnings
[39:50] &gt;&gt; that we don't even understand.
[39:53] Now I believe for the elect of God, I'm
[39:56] just bringing this to you quickly. For
[39:59] the elect of God, God has placed in the
[40:03] seed. Let every seed bring forth after
[40:07] its own kind. So God has placed in the
[40:10] seed that eternal life seed that you
[40:14] came into the world. You possessed it
[40:16] even though you didn't know it. You
[40:18] perhaps wandered in the world. You
[40:20] wandered into this religion or that
[40:23] denomination or this spiritual looking,
[40:26] thirsting, craving. Where is it? This
[40:30] reality. You're in the world and perhaps
[40:32] trying to fill your belly full of things
[40:34] in the world. And even then, we're
[40:36] saying this isn't it, but where is it?
[40:39] What is it that I'm craving for? Now,
[40:42] now that is God put that nature in that
[40:47] seed. He put that craving in that seed
[40:51] so that it would respond to the calling
[40:54] of God because God is calling to it.
[40:57] He's calling because he knows what that
[41:00] is going to become. And so he keeps
[41:03] calling to it. Now here I'm taking the
[41:06] natural seed, the Jewish people, and
[41:09] God's calling to them. And and if you
[41:13] can follow this then it will be a a
[41:16] great uh benefit to us. Oh the depth of
[41:20] the riches both of the wisdom and
[41:22] knowledge of God. How uncarchable are
[41:25] his judgment and his ways past finding
[41:29] out. Now I need to unite
[41:32] another thought
[41:35] uh to the subject at this point. And I'm
[41:37] just going to interject this and that is
[41:40] when we think in terms of uh uh uh
[41:44] someone being called, you know, well,
[41:48] someone called me or or I'm calling
[41:50] someone. We usually associate a name
[41:55] with that calling. Uh and so we have a
[41:59] name. I I'd like to really try and and
[42:02] have you get out of the box of of our
[42:05] normal type of thinking. Now, each of us
[42:09] have a name, but I became very very
[42:12] interested and I have been for a long
[42:14] time realizing that a name is associated
[42:19] with the life that we live. And I've
[42:21] used a simple example and I've gi I've
[42:24] given it to so many of of you and others
[42:27] that have been baptized in this tank and
[42:29] I have spoken to them privately. And I
[42:33] go to uh Romans the 6th chapter and
[42:36] saying that we that are dead, how that
[42:38] we how is it that we that are dead to
[42:40] sin live any longer in it? We're dead
[42:43] because we're baptized into into Jesus
[42:46] Christ. And I asked the question, how is
[42:49] it that you're baptized? I know that you
[42:51] can be baptized. I understand you can be
[42:53] baptized in water. You can be baptized
[42:56] in the Holy Spirit because you're just
[42:58] completely uh uh completely uh immersed
[43:02] in it. But how are you baptized into a
[43:05] person? How are you baptized into this
[43:08] person? Jesus Christ is a being. This is
[43:12] a person. How are we baptized into a
[43:14] person? Well, it's because we take on uh
[43:17] by a supernatural divine act. We take on
[43:22] a part of his life. There's a portion of
[43:25] this word that's given for you
[43:28] each individually to live out. God has
[43:32] ordained that you will live out a
[43:35] portion of the life of Jesus Christ. He
[43:37] only lived a little sliver of this space
[43:40] of time.
[43:42] for 33 years he lived and he only
[43:45] ministered 33 and a2 years of that time
[43:49] such a small and yet he is the main
[43:52] theme he's the main person of this
[43:55] entire Bible from cover to cover and so
[43:58] there are shadows and particular
[44:01] uh in the old testament you know there
[44:04] is shadows of him there's god has given
[44:07] indications of his life and so on and
[44:09] even when the people were living it they
[44:11] didn't know that they were living it
[44:13] because they were actually living out
[44:15] and acting out a part of Jesus Christ in
[44:18] a shadow, but it was not even known to
[44:20] them. Now, here we are on the other side
[44:23] and and we're, you know, we're not just
[44:26] here to earn a living and and and and go
[44:28] from a point A of birth and point, you
[44:31] know, Z or zed of of of at our death.
[44:35] That's that's not our purpose on earth.
[44:38] our purpose. We have been called by God
[44:41] to come here and live out a portion of
[44:44] the life of Jesus Christ. And it is that
[44:47] portion that God is calling to. And and
[44:49] and so now when we come to the name, you
[44:52] know, when you were born, our parents
[44:55] thought, well, you know, try to look at
[44:57] you and say, what do we call this child?
[45:00] And brother Brandham talks about names
[45:01] and we put some uh uh reference uh and
[45:04] importance to the name. But I just want
[45:06] to say this to you. A name is not uh
[45:10] just a word.
[45:13] We say Jesus here. You go overseas, they
[45:16] don't know what Jesus means. You go to
[45:18] someone and they'll say yau.
[45:21] So it's a different phrase. It's it's
[45:23] but but when you say Jesus and they say
[45:26] yesu, you're thinking of the same
[45:28] person. You you you've got the same
[45:31] concept.
[45:33] Now
[45:35] most of you know that the Jews they do
[45:39] not write the word God. They leave the O
[45:43] out of God and just have G dash D. The
[45:48] reason for that is the Jewish people
[45:51] have such a deep respect for the name of
[45:54] God. They do not believe that a human is
[45:58] worthy to utter it
[46:01] because the name does not speak of just
[46:04] a a a a word that describes a person.
[46:08] It's not just to call a person but the
[46:11] name is is that being or that person
[46:15] their reputation.
[46:17] It is that they say uh the scripture
[46:19] refers to and I'll come to it later on.
[46:21] A good name is more to be desired than
[46:25] great riches. What is a good name? It's
[46:28] a reputation. And what is a reputation?
[46:31] It's a life that you live. So the name
[46:34] really the essence of the name is the
[46:37] life that you and I live. You can turn
[46:40] the lights back on if you would please
[46:42] and then because I'll come back to the
[46:44] rest of the slides later on.
[46:46] So, and so when the when the when God in
[46:51] the scripture named say Abraham Abram
[46:56] and he said to Abram get out from your
[46:58] land etc etc and then he made promises
[47:01] to him and so I'm going to come to it
[47:03] later on so I don't want to get too deep
[47:05] into it right at this moment but then
[47:07] when he came to uh he he told him he was
[47:11] going to have a son but when the time
[47:13] came that the promise should be given
[47:16] when the promise should be given and
[47:19] should come about
[47:21] then God changed his name and inserted
[47:26] part of deity in his name and inserted
[47:30] part of deity the letter H into Sarah's
[47:33] name not so that Sarah would be you know
[47:36] it was Sarai now it's Sarah it is Abram
[47:39] now it's Abraham it's not just that his
[47:41] name should sound different what God was
[47:44] saying is You are going to live a
[47:47] different life.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; You are going to produce something you
[47:50] couldn't produce before. Your future is
[47:54] going to be changed from what you have
[47:56] been all of these years. It's going to
[47:59] be different because deity now has
[48:02] become a part of you
[48:04] &gt;&gt; and that's going to be that's going to
[48:06] make all the difference.
[48:09] So the name is not merely a word and and
[48:13] I have here taken a a a thought as far
[48:18] as the Hebrews were concerned. The name
[48:20] of God was therefore not a mere word and
[48:25] please just hang on to these things very
[48:27] fervently and zealously this morning.
[48:30] But the whole of the divine
[48:32] manifestation. So the name whether you
[48:35] say Jesus or you say Elohim, Elohim or
[48:39] Adoni or any of these other titles and
[48:42] names of God for God had many names. But
[48:46] it it was not that. It was it had
[48:49] reference
[48:51] to the whole of the divine manifestation
[48:55] the character of God as revealed in his
[48:59] relations to his people and in his
[49:03] dealings with them. Now, uh I'll read a
[49:06] scripture later on too. I'm just laying
[49:08] all of this broad foundation. Like it
[49:11] says in the time of Moses,
[49:14] God Moses asked to see God's face. He
[49:18] wanted to know him more. So he said uh
[49:22] uh uh you can't see my face, but I'll
[49:26] proclaim the name of the Lord. God spoke
[49:29] to him. I'll proclaim the name of the
[49:31] Lord for he is gracious and he will show
[49:34] mercy and so on so forth. What's he
[49:36] saying? that his name is associated with
[49:39] his attributes. He's going to show
[49:41] mercy. He's going to he's going to be
[49:44] something more than they knew of this
[49:47] God.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; And that's how they will know. It's not
[49:50] that his name was gracious or his name
[49:52] was mercy or his name but it was it was
[49:55] the name of the Lord but he said I'll
[49:58] proclaim it. The pro proclamation or
[50:01] proclaiming the name was that God was
[50:04] showing a whole new dimension of mercy
[50:07] to the people because God had been held
[50:10] in such fear and reverence and and and
[50:13] reverence is fine but fear that you know
[50:16] he it it's all judgment and he's going
[50:18] to come with such judgment and and
[50:20] justice that and he has that but he
[50:23] wanted them to know that he's also a god
[50:26] of justice. not only justice, but he's a
[50:29] god of grace and he's a god of mercy and
[50:32] I'll proclaim my name.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; That was the proclamation of his name.
[50:38] He was his name is not just he didn't he
[50:41] say well now you're going to say this
[50:43] and that'll be my name. No, it has
[50:45] nothing to do with that. It's the life
[50:47] that you live in and a human person. If
[50:49] you went down uh and and when I'm at
[50:52] when I'm counseling people about
[50:54] baptism, I say uh the name is is the
[50:57] life and you're baptized into the person
[50:59] you're baptized. We immerse you into and
[51:02] that's why we say you come up to live
[51:04] the life of Jesus Christ. You're dead.
[51:06] The old man is dead and a new man lives
[51:10] and a new man with a new life. And it's
[51:12] all through the message. Brother
[51:13] Brandham said, "If if I had the life of
[51:16] uh Dillinger in me, I'd be a criminal.
[51:18] If I had the life of Bach in me, I'll
[51:20] write music. If I had the light life of
[51:23] de Leonardo da Vinci in me, I will I
[51:26] will paint great great artwork because
[51:29] you have to because the life is actually
[51:31] calling for that to happen. That's what
[51:34] was in the seed in that natural human
[51:36] seed came out with those abilities.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the name in the scripture
[51:43] to call your name, the name is used in
[51:47] my message this morning is called by
[51:50] your new name.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; The name in the in the Hebrew now or
[51:57] rather in the Greek was
[52:00] the name is used for everything which
[52:04] the name covers. The name is everything.
[52:08] It is the thought or feeling of which is
[52:11] aroused in the mind by mentioning the
[52:14] name. You you you mention some person's
[52:17] name and they'll say, "Oh yeah, that
[52:20] fellow."
[52:23] I said to people, if you went to a
[52:25] graveyard and and I'm gone and passed
[52:27] on, you'll say, you know, here lies
[52:29] Edward Biscll and so on so forth. They
[52:31] say, "Oh, yeah. Yeah, he didn't he had
[52:34] live in an old white house over here on
[52:37] 176th Street or Yeah, though he was
[52:40] connected with that log church. What?
[52:42] It's not it's not the name how it
[52:44] sounds. Edward F. Biscll that doesn't
[52:47] mean anything. It is what that person
[52:50] did.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; They're good, they're bad, and all the
[52:53] rest of it. They say, "Oh, I remember
[52:55] him. He shafted me one day. He took me
[52:59] to the cleaners." And that's the thing
[53:01] they remember. Or they say, you know
[53:03] what, he spoke to me one day about
[53:05] Christ and I never I never felt so
[53:08] affected. You know, oh, he pastored a
[53:11] church and I was in that church two or
[53:13] three times and I never had a feeling
[53:16] like that. You have all kinds of
[53:18] different things which are conjured in
[53:20] the mind from the sound of the name. So
[53:24] the name is not a word. The name is a
[53:26] life.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; So we're called by your new name or
[53:30] called by your new life.
[53:32] Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; All right. And the name is also it can
[53:37] it can serve as one's rank or their
[53:40] authority or their interests or their
[53:43] pleasure or deeds their deeds or
[53:45] whatever more. Now to the Greeks and
[53:48] this is in JP vine
[53:51] uh to the Greeks this meant and this was
[53:55] the name and the name is connected to
[53:58] knowledge to know something of that
[54:01] person and so to the Greeks this meant
[54:04] to know facts
[54:07] if you had knew facts but these facts
[54:10] may not affect one's conduct when you
[54:14] gain knowledge Janosco to know. Oh, I
[54:17] know something.
[54:19] And to the Greeks just they love
[54:22] knowledge. The scripture says, "Oh, they
[54:24] would learn this and they would learn
[54:25] that." They like to get together to gain
[54:27] knowledge. And and a lot of people in
[54:29] the message are that way.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to hear something new
[54:33] and new revel. Whoa, I never heard it
[54:35] that way before. Isn't that incredible?
[54:37] And oh, it is so wonderful and it's it's
[54:40] intoxicating and it's inspiring and it's
[54:43] exciting and and and if you can be made
[54:46] to believe this is a new revelation. You
[54:48] never heard this one before. You've
[54:49] never heard this one preached before.
[54:51] And this is so exclusive. It only comes
[54:53] from one person. You got to be sure and
[54:55] hear their tape.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Have you heard it? You got to be sure in
[55:00] here that you read their message and it
[55:03] and actually would finally take
[55:05] precedent over the prophet's message. I
[55:07] say beware of that spirit.
[55:11] Be careful of that one. It's not as
[55:13] exciting as you think. But it's
[55:15] knowledge. Knowledge. Knowledge. But to
[55:18] the Jews, it's not merely knowledge.
[55:21] To the Jew, true knowledge
[55:25] always manifested itself in one's
[55:28] conduct.
[55:29] Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; One did not know something until that
[55:34] fact. Now you didn't know something. Are
[55:37] you listening? You do not know something
[55:40] until that fact has worked has a
[55:44] practical outworking in your life.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; That's when you know something.
[55:52] Brother Brandon, when he was finished
[55:54] preaching the seals,
[55:56] he said to Billy Paul, "And this what
[55:58] Billy has said, did do you understand
[56:00] that?" "Yeah." "Yeah, I understood it."
[56:02] "Yeah."
[56:04] He said, "Billy, did you understand it?"
[56:06] "Yeah, yeah, Daddy, I I understood it,
[56:10] Billy,
[56:12] did you really understand what I was
[56:14] saying?" He said, "No, Dad, I didn't
[56:15] understand it." That's right.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; That's about the way it is sometime. You
[56:21] know, go God is our fathers. He's trying
[56:23] to teach us something. Did you
[56:25] understand that? Yeah, I think I got it.
[56:26] I think I understand it. Do you? And he
[56:28] asks us over and over, do we understand
[56:30] it? Well, it's not known until it
[56:34] actually begins to have an outworking in
[56:37] a person's life.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? Yes.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; And this is in in Jewish thought.
[56:49] Please excuse me just giving this long
[56:52] introduction. In Jewish thought, a name
[56:55] is not merely an arbitrary designation
[57:00] or a random combination of sounds
[57:04] because your name is has got certain
[57:06] sounds. to the to the Hebrews. That's
[57:09] not what a name was. The name conveys
[57:13] the nature
[57:15] and essence of the thing named.
[57:20] If if I say lion,
[57:23] you don't think of a little mouse
[57:24] running across the floor,
[57:26] &gt;&gt; right? you think of something that's you
[57:28] know most powerful and roars and makes
[57:32] everything tremble because the name
[57:36] uh uh conveys the nature and the essence
[57:40] of the thing named and that is why Adam
[57:43] named all the animals and it's spoken of
[57:46] in the scripture because that was
[57:47] important he named them after their
[57:50] nature and and the kind of life the kind
[57:52] of abilities the kind of talents the
[57:54] kind of creature
[57:56] that they wear, it represents the
[57:59] history and reputation of the being
[58:01] named
[58:03] and it goes on to say uh when we refer
[58:06] to a person's reputation as a good name.
[58:09] Oh, he has a good name. What are we
[58:12] saying? When a company is sold, they may
[58:15] be sold in in the in the assets of the
[58:17] company, they say, well, part of it is
[58:19] their goodwill. What is their goodwill?
[58:21] It's their reputation and that's
[58:23] associated with the name of the company.
[58:25] say, "Well, we're buying this company
[58:27] and and we're buying we we also want the
[58:30] name and the goodwill." If you get the
[58:32] goodwill, then you get the name. If the
[58:35] company has not got a good reputation,
[58:37] you don't want to be associated with
[58:38] that name. So, you can have the name.
[58:40] I'll just purchase, you know, whatever
[58:42] of the of of the company.
[58:46] in uh in Exodus 3, you don't have to
[58:48] turn to it, but Moses, you'll remember
[58:51] very very well when Moses asked God,
[58:54] "What's his name?"
[58:57] He said, Moses said, "Who shall I say
[59:00] sent me?" When I come and tell the
[59:03] people, "I've met you and this is what
[59:05] God has said, who will I say sent me?"
[59:09] It isn't that he expected God to say, "S
[59:12] say Jehovah sent you.
[59:15] That wasn't it at all. That isn't even
[59:18] what Moses was asking. What kind of a
[59:21] person is it? What kind of a being are
[59:23] you? Who is sending me? What kind of a
[59:27] what kind of a being? What is your
[59:29] nature? What is your intent? What is it
[59:32] you what is it that you want to do? How
[59:35] will I say who sent me? What is my
[59:38] purpose of going? And brother Brandham
[59:42] refers to that. He said uh and so Moses
[59:46] asked God what his name is. Moses is not
[59:49] asking what should I call you. Rather
[59:53] he's asking who are you? What are you
[59:57] like? And what have you done?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; What kind of a being are you?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And and that is clear from God's
[1:00:05] response. God replies that he's eternal.
[1:00:09] I'm the God of Abraham. I'm the God of
[1:00:11] Isaac. I'm the God of Jacob. So, he's
[1:00:14] placing himself way back. He's showing
[1:00:16] that he's eternal and he's showing that
[1:00:18] he's present. He said it it's clear from
[1:00:21] his response that he's eternal, that he
[1:00:24] is the God of our ancestors, that he has
[1:00:27] seen our affliction. He's I he I've seen
[1:00:30] their affliction and I will redeem them
[1:00:33] from bondage.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; And now Moses has a concept of who it is
[1:00:38] that's talking to him. This is who I
[1:00:41] have been. Uh Moses wor Abraham
[1:00:44] worshiped me. Isaac worshiped me. Jacob
[1:00:47] worshiped me. And now I've heard these
[1:00:49] people. I've heard their cry. And so
[1:00:52] he's he's a God of of of hearing. He's a
[1:00:55] God that's alive. He's a God that's
[1:00:57] touched with the bondage of the people.
[1:01:00] And he's a God of power. And he's a God
[1:01:02] that's present. And I've come down now
[1:01:05] to do something. And I'm sending you to
[1:01:07] do it. Oh, this is the kind of being.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; So now he has a completely different
[1:01:13] concept of who God is. And so he he goes
[1:01:17] out. So So God to him is got a new name,
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; It's not just the sound of some some
[1:01:26] verbiage or some syllable, etc.
[1:01:30] So God is calling to the life that is in
[1:01:35] you by predestination. Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; I want to say that again. God is
[1:01:41] calling. You say that you you say,
[1:01:44] "Well, why are you here today, you're
[1:01:47] here?" I would say you are sitting here
[1:01:50] because God at some point called to you,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; did he not?
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; You might even remember where that
[1:02:03] happened first. But you are some came
[1:02:06] right out of sin, some came out of
[1:02:09] religion, some came out of very good
[1:02:12] homes. Many of you young people etc. You
[1:02:15] have come out of godly homes with
[1:02:18] believers and Christian parents. You've
[1:02:21] come in that kind of an atmosphere. But
[1:02:23] you there will be some time as I did. I
[1:02:26] had a very godly home. But there was a
[1:02:29] time when I began to be awakened inside
[1:02:33] personally and God be to call me and
[1:02:36] talk to me.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Every man, every woman, every child must
[1:02:42] experience that. And then he's he's not
[1:02:44] calling you to change your name
[1:02:47] necessarily. It's something different.
[1:02:48] What he's doing is calling you to
[1:02:50] another life. Right.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I I I'm I'm not I'm not speaking
[1:02:57] now about person's name and and uh you
[1:03:01] know what we call our name. And brother
[1:03:03] Brandham says, you know, if a child's
[1:03:05] name is Ricky, don't call him that. I
[1:03:07] believe that we should call our children
[1:03:09] good godly names. But I'm not on that
[1:03:11] subject today. I'm on something quite
[1:03:14] different. So now, let me make this
[1:03:16] statement again. God
[1:03:19] is calling
[1:03:22] I want to I want you to know today I'm
[1:03:24] announcing this to you which might make
[1:03:28] known some of the things you have
[1:03:30] experienced but even more so what you
[1:03:34] will experience and what we are
[1:03:36] experienced and why the message come.
[1:03:38] God is calling to the life that is in
[1:03:42] you by predestination.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. in the invisible union.
[1:03:49] He said she looked down there and she
[1:03:51] seen her baby. She screamed. It was the
[1:03:56] voice of something. Now, he's speaking
[1:03:57] about the eagle. Incidentally, just just
[1:04:00] maybe a 100 meters or 100 yards from our
[1:04:03] house is a tree. And I I shared it with
[1:04:07] uh some of the staff in the office. And
[1:04:09] it it's it's really funny, you know.
[1:04:12] It's really funny because here's these
[1:04:14] uh they build a e two eagles built a
[1:04:17] nest up there. It's a massive thing, you
[1:04:20] know, probably six, eight feet across
[1:04:22] and they just picked a place right in a
[1:04:24] a tree and it the housing development is
[1:04:27] all around and they built right there.
[1:04:29] My neighbor lives right across the
[1:04:31] street. Excuse me for taking this time,
[1:04:33] but he subdivided because he has about
[1:04:35] like an acre and his house living on the
[1:04:38] acre. And so he subdivided it right in
[1:04:40] half and and and and the back part of
[1:04:43] this lot, the front part faces our
[1:04:46] street and the back part faces a nice
[1:04:48] culde-sac and subdivision where they're
[1:04:50] making new subdivision. and and right
[1:04:52] dead across the street, right dead
[1:04:56] across the street is this great big, you
[1:04:58] know, alder tree or something and this
[1:05:01] nest up in the middle of it in a it's in
[1:05:04] a kind of a they chose a place that had
[1:05:07] several, you know, wise like that and
[1:05:09] they just rested that nest in there. And
[1:05:11] so I was talking to the neighbor across
[1:05:13] who he was building the neighbor's house
[1:05:15] because they're starting to build the
[1:05:17] man died and his widow is building this
[1:05:19] house and now it faces right up front
[1:05:22] and I thought that they were going to
[1:05:23] sell it and let someone else build at
[1:05:26] the back and uh so I'm talking to this
[1:05:29] builder. He said, "Well, no, I'm
[1:05:31] building it for, you know, for Lynn as
[1:05:33] her name." And uh he said actually she's
[1:05:36] away on a trip with my wife right now
[1:05:38] and and I'm just you know building this
[1:05:40] house for them. Oh. He says I got held
[1:05:43] up. I just was so held up. The city held
[1:05:45] me up so long months. He said they held
[1:05:47] me up. I said oh I said yeah they're you
[1:05:51] know they can be really bad. And uh I
[1:05:53] said what what they hold you up for? He
[1:05:55] said eagles. Eagles. I said pardon? He
[1:05:59] said eagles. I said excuse me. I
[1:06:02] couldn't get what he was saying. Eagles.
[1:06:03] He said, "Eagles, I got the nest up
[1:06:05] there." "Oh, yeah." I said, "Yeah, I
[1:06:07] know. There's a nest back there." Well,
[1:06:08] he says, "They wouldn't let me build
[1:06:10] here for months." He said, "I had to
[1:06:11] wait till the nest was empty and the and
[1:06:14] the birds were gone." And I and he he
[1:06:17] said, "Oh, yeah, no." He said, he said,
[1:06:18] "I had environmentalists here all the
[1:06:20] time and they won't let you build." So,
[1:06:22] then I found out that's why they had to
[1:06:24] build up to the front. They couldn't
[1:06:25] even build back there. And there's a big
[1:06:27] piece of property, probably, you know,
[1:06:29] $2 million worth of property. And it's
[1:06:32] it's I often wondered why aren't they
[1:06:33] building on that property and then then
[1:06:36] you know I begin to clue in. So I was
[1:06:39] driving there just a couple of days ago
[1:06:42] and this is February you know to the
[1:06:44] middle of February and out on this limb
[1:06:46] is a great big eagle just sitting there
[1:06:48] right over the nest and I thought
[1:06:51] goodness they're back. They're back.
[1:06:53] Whoever owns this property might as well
[1:06:56] just say goodbye to it because they're
[1:06:59] never going to be able to build. And
[1:07:01] then I looked real close and I thought I
[1:07:02] saw a little white head in the nest. And
[1:07:05] I looked. Sure enough, there's one
[1:07:07] sitting in the nest. And my wife and I
[1:07:09] drive here to church in the morning.
[1:07:11] Here's both of them sitting, you know,
[1:07:12] about 2, three feet from the nest
[1:07:14] sitting there. I said, "Isn't that
[1:07:17] funny?" You know, God, he just pulls it
[1:07:19] over on these people. You know, they're
[1:07:21] going to build big million-dollar home
[1:07:23] there. And God just says, "Not here. Not
[1:07:26] going to build it here. I'm going to
[1:07:28] have a couple eagles." But you know,
[1:07:29] they got a nature in them.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; They got a nature and they're just there
[1:07:32] chirping to one another and I don't
[1:07:34] think they have a clue what trouble
[1:07:36] they're causing the people on the
[1:07:37] ground. And and quite frankly, I don't
[1:07:40] think they care. But that but that just
[1:07:41] happens to be their nature. Now, Brother
[1:07:43] Brandham's telling his eagle story, and
[1:07:45] you've all heard it many, many times.
[1:07:47] Listen. He said, "She looked down there,
[1:07:50] mother eagle. She looked down there and
[1:07:52] she seen her baby and she screamed.
[1:07:58] I want to I want to just say something.
[1:08:01] Brother Bram told that many times.
[1:08:04] He had never heard that sound before.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; He had never heard a scream, eagle
[1:08:12] scream before.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; He said it was the voice of something
[1:08:18] that echoed from inside of him.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; It was there by virtue of his birth.
[1:08:27] Yes.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; The kind of seed or the kind of egg he
[1:08:30] was hatched from.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; He had the capacity to understand that
[1:08:36] because that was already in his nature.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to go to school. He
[1:08:41] didn't have to go to church. He didn't
[1:08:43] have to have a chicken or anybody else
[1:08:46] teach him. He didn't even have to have
[1:08:47] another eagle come and tell him. He had
[1:08:50] it in him. Amen.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; He understood that scream
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; and and he could not do what she was
[1:08:59] screaming for. She was screaming for him
[1:09:02] to come up there. She was screaming for
[1:09:05] him to come into a higher level of
[1:09:08] maturity. You actually can fly. You
[1:09:11] don't have to be on that dung pile
[1:09:13] anymore. You can actually fly out of
[1:09:16] this mess up into the heavens. and and
[1:09:18] and he's but he's never done it before.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, let a real predestinated
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; born germ predestinated by God hear the
[1:09:35] word of God. It's music to him.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; You maybe never heard it before, but it
[1:09:41] is a music to him."
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:09:46] He knows it's the truth.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Mama, it sounds real.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; How am I going to get out of this?
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Just make a jump.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; And I'll catch you.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do." He said,
[1:10:00] "The anointed word of God being
[1:10:03] vindicated before any man that's been
[1:10:05] born as a son of God with the
[1:10:08] predestinated germ into him for this
[1:10:11] hour, he'll see God's message as sure as
[1:10:15] there's a God in heaven."
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll see it as sure as
[1:10:21] there's a God in heaven. And if you're a
[1:10:24] son or a daughter of God, you have it in
[1:10:27] you because it came by your spiritual
[1:10:30] birth.
[1:10:34] [Music]
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; I may be getting ahead of myself.
[1:10:41] Abraham
[1:10:43] Abram was called of God
[1:10:46] and told to leave his country
[1:10:50] and to go to a place I'll show you and
[1:10:53] he left immediately.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Lot went with him and
[1:11:01] so now he's going his wife. Now, he
[1:11:04] married, Brother Brandham said he
[1:11:06] married his young halfsister.
[1:11:11] They've been married for many years.
[1:11:15] Married for 75 years.
[1:11:19] And God didn't just start then, but God
[1:11:22] told him, "I'm going to show you a
[1:11:24] land." And God begins to Let me just ask
[1:11:28] you in all simplicity and in all truth,
[1:11:33] do you think that it was when God said
[1:11:35] to him, "I'm going to give you a seed."
[1:11:38] Do you think that was the first time he
[1:11:40] thought about having a child? No.
[1:11:43] They craved that all their lives.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; They desired that
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; because they felt that was a part of,
[1:11:51] you know, their life and they they
[1:11:54] craved that. But they didn't crave it
[1:11:56] because, listen close, because as two
[1:11:59] humans, they simply want to have a baby.
[1:12:02] That's not it. They had a a deeper
[1:12:06] craving. They had a deeper calling
[1:12:09] within them because they were called to
[1:12:12] fulfill a certain part of this
[1:12:14] scripture.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; They were called to fulfill a a very
[1:12:19] significant part. They were called. He
[1:12:22] was called to be a father of nations,
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; but he didn't know that. But now he's 75
[1:12:29] and God is telling him and it and it and
[1:12:31] notice now, please, because this is
[1:12:34] important to you and I where we are, God
[1:12:37] begins to almost
[1:12:41] enchant him. You're going to have a son.
[1:12:45] Oh, well that's what I I'm going to give
[1:12:48] you a land. You're going to have a seed
[1:12:52] and at this station and another station,
[1:12:54] another station. He just keeps telling
[1:12:56] him, I'm going to bless you and through
[1:12:59] you I'm going to bless nations. I'm
[1:13:02] going to give you a seed. And he keeps
[1:13:04] telling them even till Abraham, Abraham
[1:13:06] says, "What will you give me?"
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; You know, how will you confirm this that
[1:13:12] I'm going to have a son? And it's like
[1:13:15] God at all these different stations of
[1:13:17] his life, of your life, and he begins to
[1:13:20] speak to him things he'd never heard
[1:13:22] before.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; There are depths of truth
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; in this message, which you know the
[1:13:31] phrase very well, but when you hear it,
[1:13:34] you'd say,
[1:13:36] I so wish I could attain to that.
[1:13:39] So he was he was speaking to Abraham and
[1:13:42] telling him you're going to do this and
[1:13:45] you're going to have this but he wasn't
[1:13:47] even telling him exactly how it's going
[1:13:50] to happen. And he Abraham no doubt was
[1:13:54] saying
[1:13:55] how will I do this? How can I achieve
[1:13:58] this? How can I come to this position
[1:14:02] this place? You know how's it going to
[1:14:04] happen?
[1:14:06] We see things. Let me be honest with
[1:14:08] you. We hear things in the word on a
[1:14:11] continual B. We hear about a life in
[1:14:13] Christ
[1:14:16] and you go home and go out of this place
[1:14:18] and maybe even while you're sitting
[1:14:19] listening to the word, you say, "Well,
[1:14:22] I know it's there and I know that the
[1:14:26] prophet of God spoke it and I know it,
[1:14:28] but I just haven't seem to achieve it. I
[1:14:32] haven't seemed to attain to it. I go
[1:14:35] month after month and year after year
[1:14:39] and it seems to be the same thing. I
[1:14:42] don't seem to attain to it. In fact is
[1:14:45] there's times when be honest with me now
[1:14:48] or I'll be honest to you. There are
[1:14:51] times when you say I'm lower now than
[1:14:54] I've ever been.
[1:14:58] I haven't been gaining ground. I've been
[1:15:00] losing ground.
[1:15:03] At least that's what it seems like to
[1:15:05] me.
[1:15:10] And God kept telling Abraham, "You're
[1:15:12] going to have it."
[1:15:14] Finally, his wife and you know in
[1:15:16] whatever frustration or whatever went on
[1:15:18] in their private life and so on says,
[1:15:21] "Well, take Hagar.
[1:15:24] Have a child with Hagar."
[1:15:26] And and she did. It was all part of the
[1:15:28] scripture. and he has a child with Hagar
[1:15:31] and and comes Ishmael into the world and
[1:15:34] we've had a lot of trouble ever since.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; But that was all part of the program. It
[1:15:40] never changed God's mind about Abraham.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says, "You're a
[1:15:50] son.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; You'll always be a son.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; You're a daughter. You'll always be a
[1:15:56] daughter."
[1:15:57] I'm going to read a quote for you if I
[1:15:59] have time later on. He says, "I I I'm a
[1:16:03] sinner, but I'm an heir."
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; I may be a drunkard, but I'm an heir.
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; That's what was important.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; And God had already identified, Abram,
[1:16:16] you're going to have a son. Whether you
[1:16:19] take Hagar and have another son and have
[1:16:22] Ishmael and have other children, that's
[1:16:25] irrelevant. It's what's in my mind. It's
[1:16:28] what's in God's mind. And that's what
[1:16:30] God was calling to. The gifts and
[1:16:33] calling of God are without repentance.
[1:16:37] God will not change his mind.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; He's not going to say at some point in
[1:16:43] time, I'm sorry I called you. And
[1:16:46] brother Brandham talks about the two
[1:16:48] books. He talks about the book of life
[1:16:50] and our deeds are written in the book of
[1:16:52] life. But there's another book called
[1:16:54] the called the lamb's book of life.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; And he talks about our first nature that
[1:17:02] came by our natural birth.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; And so now listen, this will help us as
[1:17:09] we go along.
[1:17:11] While we are living in this cornal
[1:17:14] flesh, while we're living in the flesh
[1:17:17] is weak. Jesus said, "It was weak when
[1:17:19] he said it and it's still weak. The
[1:17:22] flesh is always weak. While we live with
[1:17:25] these prickles and stickers while we try
[1:17:28] to deal with the weaknesses and the
[1:17:31] frailties and perhaps the things we
[1:17:33] inherited, but don't blame everything on
[1:17:35] your parents."
[1:17:38] And we have these
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; and they start showing up even with the
[1:17:42] children when you're young. Certain
[1:17:45] certain things start showing up. And we
[1:17:48] have these things. And don't anybody
[1:17:50] look too sanctimonious here because I'm
[1:17:52] prepared to say everybody has it.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; We have something we wish we were rid
[1:17:58] of.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; But let me say this to you.
[1:18:01] Even while we're in this body of flesh,
[1:18:04] even while we're in this humanity which
[1:18:07] is subjected to our environment and
[1:18:10] everything around, those elected that
[1:18:13] God has put a seed in, listen to me very
[1:18:16] close. Those elected that God has put a
[1:18:20] seed in, that seed has its own nature.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; And that nature did not come from your
[1:18:28] parents.
[1:18:30] That nature came from our heavenly
[1:18:32] parent which is God himself.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; And God will never apologize for putting
[1:18:38] his seed in the elected children.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Never will he apologize. And never will
[1:18:44] he change his mind about what he plans
[1:18:46] to do and where that seed is going to
[1:18:49] go. And because he's going to keep
[1:18:51] calling for the gifts and calling of God
[1:18:55] are without repentance. Amen.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; That's something you can't repent over.
[1:19:01] You can't say I've had I've had pastor's
[1:19:03] wife say to me, "I don't want to be a
[1:19:06] minister's wife."
[1:19:09] One said, "I don't want to live in a
[1:19:11] fishbowl and have people everybody
[1:19:13] looking at me because I hold a certain
[1:19:16] standard for a minister's wife. I don't
[1:19:18] want to live in it." But that wouldn't
[1:19:21] change the fact that she was that.
[1:19:29] And so God kept calling to Abram and
[1:19:32] later Abraham. And even in chapter 18 of
[1:19:36] of uh Genesis, God appeared to him again
[1:19:41] and told him after their conversation
[1:19:44] together, God always comes back to the
[1:19:47] same subject.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; You're going to have a son. Right.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; And now he's been waiting another 25
[1:19:55] years.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; And he's no closer to it than he was
[1:19:59] when he first heard it.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; And he's no closer to it than he was
[1:20:03] when he desired it maybe as a young man
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; with his wife Sarah.
[1:20:09] Right?
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; You see, friends
[1:20:15] and believers in God's economy,
[1:20:20] things can go very, very backwards or
[1:20:22] sideways, but it will make no difference
[1:20:26] to God.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm back at that little eagle story.
[1:20:31] And this is where some of this became
[1:20:33] inspired. How am I going to do it? He
[1:20:37] already had it in him.
[1:20:40] Even
[1:20:42] even before he heard the scream,
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; he had wings to do the flying with, but
[1:20:47] he hadn't heard the voice to call him
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; to a higher life.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; And you can do it. And all they had to
[1:20:55] hear some of the things. And I hear
[1:20:57] things in the message. Quite frankly,
[1:21:01] I'm being very, very honest. I'm going
[1:21:03] to be very, very open with you this
[1:21:06] morning. I hear things in the message
[1:21:08] and I hear brother Brandham express the
[1:21:11] depths of spiritual love
[1:21:17] and holiness and how he would speak
[1:21:19] about brethren and and
[1:21:24] I just say I'm not there yet.
[1:21:29] And I hear him speak and give
[1:21:31] instruction about how we should treat
[1:21:34] one another and how we should so respect
[1:21:38] the house of God and how we should
[1:21:41] conduct ourselves and how we should give
[1:21:44] and how we should forgive one another
[1:21:47] and how all of these things and when I
[1:21:50] try to measure to the message I have to
[1:21:53] admit I fall short.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You understand?
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; But I have confidence this morning and I
[1:22:00] came to make this announcement. The seed
[1:22:03] that is in you and has the capacity for
[1:22:06] what God is calling it too.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; And you would not have that desire
[1:22:12] unless God had put it in the seed.
[1:22:16] [Applause]
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; And so we're not here to put on some
[1:22:20] facade like we've arrived. No, we know
[1:22:23] folks that in in a lot of ways, you
[1:22:26] know, that's why we crave for the
[1:22:28] rapture.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; That's why we crave for the millennium.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Because we know this struggle will be
[1:22:35] done.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you today, you can have
[1:22:39] absolute full assurance when you know
[1:22:42] that you have responded to the voice of
[1:22:45] God. You heard the eagle scream. You've
[1:22:48] responded to it. Maybe you haven't taken
[1:22:50] wings into the heavenlies yet, but the
[1:22:52] fact that you responded, I can tell you
[1:22:55] that you have the capacity within you
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; to take wings into the heavenlies.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, sir.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Notice what the scripture says.
[1:23:18] God is calling to a life that's in you.
[1:23:21] The calling of God, the gifts and
[1:23:24] calling of God is without repentance.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Paul said in Romans, for the earnest
[1:23:34] expectation,
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; I really need your keen attention.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; For the earnest expectation of the
[1:23:42] creature,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; would the creature
[1:23:45] happen to be you and I? for the earnest
[1:23:48] expectation of the creature uh waiteth
[1:23:53] for the manifestation of the sons of
[1:23:56] God. Why are they waiting? Cuz they
[1:23:58] haven't seen it yet. But there are
[1:24:00] creatures that are waiting for the
[1:24:02] manifestation of the sons of God. Who
[1:24:05] put that waiting? Who put that earnest
[1:24:08] expectation in there? It was in the
[1:24:10] seed. It was a part of their spiritual
[1:24:13] makeup.
[1:24:17] Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:21] And he went on to say, for the creature
[1:24:23] was made subject to vanity. For the
[1:24:26] creature was made subject to vanity.
[1:24:29] What is what is vanity? It's emptiness.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; All vanity. Vanity. All is vanity, said
[1:24:36] the preacher in Ecclesiastes. It's all
[1:24:38] vanity. The world is vanity. But you
[1:24:41] have to make a living. You're part of
[1:24:43] it. You go to school and you get all the
[1:24:45] education that you can and you earn what
[1:24:47] you can and you pay your bills and you
[1:24:49] make whatever decisions in life, but all
[1:24:52] is vanity when and that's why you crave
[1:24:54] for the rapture.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; That's why you crave for millennium.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; That's why you you hear about the
[1:25:00] glories of the new home and it just
[1:25:02] something said, "Oh, oh,
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; oh, for that new home.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, for that place."
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; What is it in you?
[1:25:12] You might say, "Well, everybody desires
[1:25:14] heaven." I'm not talking about heaven.
[1:25:15] Their concept of heaven doesn't exist.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the new home as a
[1:25:21] prophet of God has declared it to be
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; as he who has been transported beyond
[1:25:26] the curtain of time and come back to
[1:25:28] give us a personal message. Don't miss
[1:25:30] it.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care what age you are or what
[1:25:35] station of life you are. Don't miss it.
[1:25:37] That's why he said, "Don't miss it.
[1:25:40] Yes, sir.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; And you have something craving in you.
[1:25:44] You've been called to this message, have
[1:25:46] you not?
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Is that why you're here?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Have you been called by this voice of
[1:25:52] God?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; The reveal revealing of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:56] And so the revealing of him, you saw him
[1:25:58] and said, "Oh, he's altogether lovely."
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I've been called by him.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If you have,
[1:26:08] then I say without any hesitation,
[1:26:12] there's something still in you
[1:26:16] that goes much deeper and further than
[1:26:19] the life that we have lived thus far.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; For the creature was made subject to
[1:26:26] vanity, not willingly.
[1:26:30] We didn't come here saying, "Oh, I want
[1:26:33] to live in this perverted generation.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; I want to live in the darkness of
[1:26:43] Leodysia.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; I want to live in this material
[1:26:49] materialistic age." No, that isn't I
[1:26:53] want to live when you can hardly make
[1:26:55] enough to pay your bills. No, that isn't
[1:26:58] what we said. So, it wasn't willingly,
[1:27:01] but by reason of him who hath subjected
[1:27:04] the same in hope.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Because the creature itself also shall
[1:27:11] be delivered
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:27:15] glorious liberty of the children of God.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:20] [Applause]
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; All right, I'm taking a left.
[1:27:26] We're we're going to take a left curve.
[1:27:29] Now,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; how many people believe you were called?
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure you also recognize God also
[1:27:42] called Israel.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; And that's what Apostle Paul was talking
[1:27:46] about in chapter 10, chapter 11. Have
[1:27:48] they stumbled? Have they been cast off?
[1:27:50] Did God do away with them? No. No.
[1:27:55] because the gifts and calling of God are
[1:27:57] without repentance. God's not going to
[1:27:59] change his mind about Israel.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; But they were darkened
[1:28:05] and God allowed
[1:28:10] some things to happen. I have I'm going
[1:28:13] to take you on a quick journey and you
[1:28:15] have to read with me. I'm going to take
[1:28:18] you from 70 AD, 70 years after Christ
[1:28:22] when Jerusalem was destroyed by Titus.
[1:28:26] I can't say that this is exactly the
[1:28:28] truth, but I I understand
[1:28:32] I visited Pompei.
[1:28:36] Anybody doesn't know what Pompei who
[1:28:38] Pompei what Pompei is. Pompea city was
[1:28:40] destroyed by I believe it's Vuvius
[1:28:45] the
[1:28:47] uh eruption of the mountain and and I've
[1:28:50] I' that was a very very wicked city it's
[1:28:53] a beautiful looks down to the ocean
[1:28:56] beautiful location
[1:28:59] and I was told by a guide that it was a
[1:29:03] city where the uh great leaders of Rome
[1:29:08] would come and it It was a festive
[1:29:10] place. It was a place of sin, deep sin.
[1:29:13] And they would come and rejoice. And I
[1:29:15] was told that Titus after destroying
[1:29:17] Jerusalem came there and and rejoiced
[1:29:20] and had his had his time of rejoicing in
[1:29:24] Pompei. And then God destroyed it about
[1:29:27] two years after that.
[1:29:30] But I will start there and I will end up
[1:29:34] in Walmart in 204.
[1:29:39] So we'll take you quickly
[1:29:45] the diminishing of them.
[1:29:51] The branches were broken off.
[1:29:54] They stumbled
[1:29:57] and God allowed them. And it was even
[1:30:00] prophesied in the Old Testament. And I
[1:30:03] have so many scriptures. I I'm trying to
[1:30:05] watch my time, but I have so many
[1:30:07] scriptures where God says, "I I I'll
[1:30:09] scatter you. I'll scatter you to all the
[1:30:11] nations." Another place he says you'll
[1:30:14] your your name will become a byword,
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; you know, and it is
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; now this is on internet and I want to
[1:30:25] say that I'm not I'm not I'm pro-
[1:30:27] Israel,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; but yet their name has become a byword.
[1:30:32] When you try to get somebody to reduce
[1:30:34] something in price, they say to Jew them
[1:30:36] down
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; and their name has become a byword in
[1:30:42] the earth.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; But God also promised that he would
[1:30:49] raise it up.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And so the name has become a byword in
[1:30:54] the nations of the people.
[1:30:58] He said in the scripture, and I'll just
[1:30:59] try to read the scripture again,
[1:31:05] if the fall of them
[1:31:09] be the riches of the world, and the
[1:31:11] diminishing of them be the riches of the
[1:31:14] Gentiles.
[1:31:16] Now, this is how you got rich,
[1:31:20] through the diminishing of them. And the
[1:31:24] diminishing of them. diminishing is to
[1:31:26] find fault with them.
[1:31:31] The decrease or defeat of them,
[1:31:35] the loss of respects as as to salvation
[1:31:39] even that they're beyond salvation,
[1:31:41] they're beyond redemption.
[1:31:44] to make less or to be made inferior
[1:31:48] to overcome them or to be conquered by
[1:31:52] or forced to yield to one. This is the
[1:31:56] diminishing. Apostle Paul said the
[1:31:58] diminishing of them.
[1:32:01] In 70 AD, the Roman army destroyed
[1:32:04] Jerusalem, killed over 1 million Jews,
[1:32:07] took about a 100,000 into slavery and
[1:32:10] captivity, and scattered many from
[1:32:11] Palestine to other locations in the
[1:32:14] Roman Empire. In 135 AD, serious uh
[1:32:19] serious Roman persecution of the Jews
[1:32:21] began. They were forbidden upon pain of
[1:32:24] death from participating in
[1:32:26] circumcision, which was very important
[1:32:28] to them, reading the Torah of the Bible
[1:32:31] and eating unleavened bread at the
[1:32:33] Passover. You just put yourself there.
[1:32:36] Say, you're not allowed to have you
[1:32:39] can't have the bread at the communion
[1:32:42] table. We don't allow you to make this.
[1:32:45] And not not a misdemeanor. This was on
[1:32:48] the on the sentence of death.
[1:32:51] In 135 further, a temple dedicated to
[1:32:55] the Roman pagan god Jupiter was erected
[1:32:58] on the temple mount in Jerusalem. A
[1:33:01] temple of Venus Venus was built on
[1:33:06] Goltha just outside the city.
[1:33:11] The council of Nya in 3:25, which
[1:33:14] brother Brandham refers to this council
[1:33:16] multitudes of times, decided to separate
[1:33:19] the celebration of Easter from the
[1:33:21] Jewish Passover. They stated, "For it is
[1:33:25] unbecoming beyond measure that on this
[1:33:28] holiest of festivals,
[1:33:30] we would follow the customs of the Jews.
[1:33:33] Henceforth, let us have nothing to do,
[1:33:36] nothing in common with this odious
[1:33:39] people. We ought not, therefore, to have
[1:33:42] anything in common with the Jews. Our
[1:33:45] worship follows a more convenient
[1:33:47] course. We desire, dearest brethren, to
[1:33:51] separate ourselves from the detestable
[1:33:53] company of the Jews. How then could we
[1:33:57] follow these Jews who are almost
[1:33:59] certainly blinded?
[1:34:02] In 367 to 376, St. Hillary referred to
[1:34:08] Jews as a perverse people who God has
[1:34:13] cursed forever and St. Ephra uh refers
[1:34:17] to synagogues as brothel.
[1:34:21] Now these people who we refer to these
[1:34:23] are not some quiet people. These are not
[1:34:26] some parkbench politicians. These are
[1:34:29] people who
[1:34:32] had a lot of power had a lot of p had a
[1:34:34] lot of respect. So St. Augustine, not
[1:34:37] the one brother Brandham speaks of,
[1:34:39] that's I believe is St. Augustine of of
[1:34:41] Hippo.
[1:34:43] He wrote, "The true image of the Hebrews
[1:34:45] is Judas the Scariot who sells the Lord
[1:34:48] for silver. The Jew can never understand
[1:34:51] the scriptures and forever will bear the
[1:34:55] guilt for the death of Jesus."
[1:34:58] In 613, very serious persecution began
[1:35:01] in Spain and Jews were given the option
[1:35:04] to enter to either leaving Spain or
[1:35:08] converting to Christianity. Jewish
[1:35:11] children over 6 years of age were taken
[1:35:14] from their parents and given a Christian
[1:35:17] education. In 855,
[1:35:20] Jews were exiled from Italy. In 1078,
[1:35:25] Pope Gregory IIIth decreed that Jews
[1:35:28] could not hold office or be superiors to
[1:35:32] Christians.
[1:35:34] In 1146,
[1:35:36] the second crusade began. A French monk,
[1:35:39] Rudolph, called for the destruction of
[1:35:42] the Jews. In 1180, the king of France,
[1:35:46] uh, Philip Augustus, arbitrarily seized
[1:35:49] all Jewish property and expelled the
[1:35:52] Jews from the country. There was no
[1:35:54] legal justification for this action.
[1:35:57] They were allowed to sell all movable
[1:36:00] possessions, but their land and houses
[1:36:02] was stolen by the king. In 1205, Pope
[1:36:07] Innocent III wrote to the archbishops of
[1:36:10] Sans and Paris that the Jews by their
[1:36:13] own guilt are consigned to perpetual
[1:36:16] servitude because they crucified the
[1:36:19] Lord as slaves rejected by God. In 1290,
[1:36:25] Jews are excelled, exiled rather, from
[1:36:28] England. About 16,000
[1:36:31] left the country. 1298 Jews were
[1:36:34] persecuted in Austria, Bavaria, and
[1:36:38] Franconia.
[1:36:39] For 140 Jewish communities were
[1:36:42] destroyed. More than 100,000 Jews were
[1:36:46] killed over a 6month period. 1306
[1:36:51] 100,000 Jews are exiled from France.
[1:36:55] They left with only the clothes on their
[1:36:57] backs and food for only one day. In
[1:37:01] 1492, Jews were given the choice of
[1:37:04] being baptized as Christians or be
[1:37:07] banished from Spain and 300,000 left
[1:37:11] Spain penniless. 1497,
[1:37:15] Jews were banished from Portugal. 20,000
[1:37:18] left the country rather than be baptized
[1:37:21] as Christians. 1915
[1:37:24] 600,000 Jews were forcibly moved from
[1:37:28] the western borders of Russia towards
[1:37:30] the interior. About a 100,000 died of
[1:37:34] exposure or starvation.
[1:37:37] 1905, this is quite a a key part here.
[1:37:41] Secret police, Russian secret police
[1:37:45] uh converted an earlier anti-semitic
[1:37:48] novel. Now this is this this is not
[1:37:52] anything of any authority. It's a novel.
[1:37:55] It's a story. And they converted this
[1:37:58] novel into a document called the
[1:38:01] protocols of the learned elders of Zion.
[1:38:06] A Russian Orthodox priest Sergius Nelis
[1:38:12] published them publicly
[1:38:14] in 1905.
[1:38:17] It was promoted as the record of secret
[1:38:20] rebbitical conferences whose aim was to
[1:38:24] subjugate and ex exterminate the
[1:38:28] Christians. So they've taken this novel,
[1:38:31] put it into a document as to make it
[1:38:35] official and then now a priest has
[1:38:37] published it publicly and given it
[1:38:41] widespread
[1:38:42] uh circulation
[1:38:44] and and and promoted it as a record of
[1:38:48] that the rabbis have have this this is
[1:38:53] part of their document to exterminate
[1:38:55] the Christians and the protocols which
[1:38:57] they call it from here on out the
[1:38:59] protocols were used by the Ukraina and
[1:39:02] the Ukraina is the Russian secret police
[1:39:05] in a propaganda campaign that was
[1:39:07] associated with massacres of of Jews. In
[1:39:13] 1917, that's the year of the Bolevik
[1:39:15] Revolution. In the civil war following
[1:39:18] the Bolevik revolution of 1917, the
[1:39:21] reactionary white armies made extensive
[1:39:24] use of the protocols to incite
[1:39:27] widespread uh slaughters of the Jews.
[1:39:30] This isn't amazing. Widespread
[1:39:32] slaughters of of a part of humanity
[1:39:35] which has been engineered from a piece
[1:39:38] of paper which was started out as a
[1:39:40] novel.
[1:39:42] just a novel out of somebody's now get
[1:39:46] it please that novel before it became a
[1:39:48] book came out of someone's mind
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; and I think that you could agree with me
[1:39:53] that it was no less than a demon spirit
[1:39:57] that would inspire that to some
[1:40:00] possessed person in their mind and
[1:40:02] finally it would cause this incredible
[1:40:07] uh cost of life uh on humanity and I say
[1:40:11] to you I'm just stopping here.
[1:40:14] Was God mindful of this?
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Has he cast them off?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Are they broken branches forever? Or can
[1:40:21] he graft them on in? And here's God.
[1:40:24] Here's God who called Abraham. And these
[1:40:27] people are these people who this has
[1:40:30] been taking place to. They're of the
[1:40:32] natural seed of Abraham.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Now, in conjunction, in keeping with the
[1:40:38] message this morning, you'll have to go
[1:40:40] with me.
[1:40:42] Do you think that when they're sent out
[1:40:46] with nothing but food for one day, do
[1:40:50] you think for a minute that they're any
[1:40:51] different than you and I?
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Do you think for a second when 140
[1:40:56] communities and they're being
[1:40:58] slaughtered and they're being
[1:40:59] excommunicated and they're being driven
[1:41:02] and there's all kinds of decrees coming
[1:41:04] down, you cannot be a manager. You
[1:41:06] cannot be a superior over anyone else.
[1:41:09] You've got to be a subservient. You've
[1:41:11] got to serve as a slave because the pope
[1:41:13] has said so or this pope has said so.
[1:41:16] And you find yourself, I'm just asking
[1:41:18] you, do you think that that
[1:41:21] eliminated the cry that was in them?
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Is where is the God of Abraham?
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Where is the God of Abraham? What have I
[1:41:33] done? Do you think the little children
[1:41:34] that are like sitting here today on this
[1:41:37] front seat and they would they would
[1:41:38] have to be taking journey the same
[1:41:41] direction under the same onslaught. Do
[1:41:44] you think they understood that?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Come on folks.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; It might come your way one day where
[1:41:53] you'll be tested for what you believe.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; This is the diminishing of them.
[1:42:05] You're inferior.
[1:42:07] You have a fault.
[1:42:10] There's something wrong with this
[1:42:12] people. You have wrong intention. You
[1:42:14] have a wrong program. You are you are a
[1:42:18] blight on the on the scene of humanity.
[1:42:22] You don't have a right to exist. You
[1:42:24] shouldn't exist.
[1:42:26] And they keep hearing it down through
[1:42:28] the centuries.
[1:42:33] and 200,000 Jews were murdered in the
[1:42:36] Ukraine alone. That's that's where my
[1:42:39] forefathers came from.
[1:42:43] My grandfather had just left prior to
[1:42:46] this in the Ukraine. They left in 1901.
[1:42:52] In 1920, the protocols, now we're still
[1:42:55] talking about the same document. So,
[1:42:57] it's coming back from many years before
[1:43:00] the protocols reached England and the
[1:43:02] United States and they were exposed as a
[1:43:06] forgery
[1:43:08] but are widely circulated.
[1:43:10] Henry Ford sponsored a study of
[1:43:13] international activities of Jews and
[1:43:16] this led to a series of anti-semitic
[1:43:18] articles in the Dearbornne inter in
[1:43:21] Dearbornne Michigan it would be
[1:43:23] independent their newspaper which were
[1:43:26] published in a book the international
[1:43:29] Jew the protocols back to this novel
[1:43:32] part again were sold on Walmart's online
[1:43:36] store until they were removed on
[1:43:39] September the 21st, 2004.
[1:43:42] Now, we've come from 70 AD to 2004.
[1:43:47] And uh Walmart, and I I'm going to be
[1:43:49] careful with them. I've shoed there and
[1:43:51] bought clothes there. I have nothing
[1:43:52] against Walmart. They're great
[1:43:54] organization, I suppose. But they issued
[1:43:57] a public statement that it had not been
[1:44:00] proven
[1:44:02] uh and it had not been unquestionably
[1:44:05] proven that this novel article was
[1:44:08] indeed fake. And so they were not really
[1:44:13] apologizing, but under pressure they
[1:44:15] would remove it from what? From their
[1:44:18] storeshelves. What I'm saying is that
[1:44:21] this spirit,
[1:44:24] this spirit against the Jews, and we're
[1:44:27] not even talking about the six million
[1:44:30] that were completely rendered. I mean,
[1:44:34] they were it it was a system by which
[1:44:37] their combs were taken away so they
[1:44:39] couldn't comb their hair. Then their
[1:44:41] toothbrushes were taken away so they
[1:44:43] couldn't brush their teeth. Then their
[1:44:45] shoes were taken so that they would
[1:44:47] could have to walk bare feet. Then they
[1:44:49] couldn't they couldn't ride a bus. Uh
[1:44:51] they had to walk on the street. And if
[1:44:53] they were in a certain place and uh and
[1:44:56] another gentile was there, they had to
[1:44:58] stand up and give them their seat. They
[1:45:00] were completely reduced until they had
[1:45:03] lost their identity.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; You can't care for yourself physically.
[1:45:09] You can't. I'm talking about the
[1:45:11] diminishing. I'm not out of the
[1:45:12] scripture. I'm in the scripture. This is
[1:45:15] what Paul was prophesying. They're
[1:45:18] diminishing and their blindness and
[1:45:20] their breaking off and their stumbling
[1:45:22] is so that you could come in.
[1:45:25] [Applause]
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; But hath God forgotten them? God forbid.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Paul says, God who allowed them to be
[1:45:34] broken off is able to graft them in
[1:45:36] again.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; And he said, don't be wise in our own
[1:45:42] conceits. We can't just sit here and
[1:45:43] say, well, I'm so lucky I heard this
[1:45:45] message, etc. The only thing that you
[1:45:48] have that that that the only thing that
[1:45:51] you have by God's grace is that God has
[1:45:53] given you the ability to believe the
[1:45:56] word.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; And remember what I spoken earlier to
[1:46:00] believe it is to do it.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; To believe it is to do it.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; In other words, you don't know
[1:46:08] something. You haven't come to say,
[1:46:11] "Well, I know uh I know Jesus Christ. I
[1:46:14] know this message." We don't know it
[1:46:16] until it has an outworking in our lives.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; You don't have to listen to me, friends,
[1:46:24] but it's not going to change anything.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; It won't change anything. This is God's
[1:46:31] word. Amen.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; 1940,
[1:46:39] the Vichy government of France
[1:46:43] collaborated with the Nazi with Nazi
[1:46:45] Germany by freezing about 80,000
[1:46:49] Jewish bank accounts. And during the
[1:46:52] next four years, they deported about
[1:46:55] 76,000 Jews to Nazi death camps. Only
[1:47:00] about 2500 survived. It was only in
[1:47:04] 1995.
[1:47:06] That's not long ago, is it? How many
[1:47:09] here in this church were living in 1995?
[1:47:11] Would you raise your hands, please? So,
[1:47:13] you were all living when this happened.
[1:47:19] In 1995, French President Jacques Shurak
[1:47:24] was able to admit that the state bore a
[1:47:28] heavy share of responsibility
[1:47:30] in the mass roundups and deportations of
[1:47:34] Jews as well as in the property and
[1:47:37] asset seizures that were that were
[1:47:40] carried out with the act act of help in
[1:47:44] the Vichy regime.
[1:47:49] Now
[1:47:51] if the fall of them
[1:47:54] be the riches of the world,
[1:47:58] the riches of the world because through
[1:48:00] the fall of them they rejected the
[1:48:02] gospel. They said henceforth we go to
[1:48:04] the Gentiles.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; That's how it happened. I've taken the
[1:48:08] Jews from that time from from Christ
[1:48:11] time even till now. But I go back to I
[1:48:14] go back to the early church at the same
[1:48:16] time. And I haven't taken the early
[1:48:18] church. We haven't got time. But if we
[1:48:20] could go back to the early church and I
[1:48:22] can tell you it's an unbroken line of
[1:48:25] faith going from the from the faith of
[1:48:28] the fathers. And that is why oh my
[1:48:31] friends I just pray that God will give
[1:48:33] me the strength and the energy. That is
[1:48:35] why the messenger of this age, the
[1:48:39] message that he was given, it says that
[1:48:42] he will turn the hearts of the children
[1:48:47] back to the fathers, back to the
[1:48:49] original faith. How could we be turned
[1:48:52] back to the original faith unless the
[1:48:53] original faith was exposed and made
[1:48:56] known? And so the message is is
[1:48:59] unveiling to us the original faith. And
[1:49:02] if there's anything in you that that has
[1:49:05] that God has called to that has turned
[1:49:07] you back and you could say if you can
[1:49:10] say this morning, I have been turned
[1:49:12] back to the original faith. Not bits and
[1:49:15] pieces, but I've been turned back to the
[1:49:17] original faith. You might say,
[1:49:20] I hear things and I'm so far below that.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; That's fine.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Do you see where I'm going this morning?
[1:49:30] Through
[1:49:32] all of this, from 70 AD
[1:49:36] to 2004,
[1:49:38] we have an absolute unbroken
[1:49:43] hatred and diminishing of the Jews.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; It never ceased. They continued to be I
[1:49:50] had I had Jewish leaders say to me, "How
[1:49:54] can I become unchosen?" Yeah, exactly.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Now, it wasn't it wasn't a pastor's wife
[1:50:00] saying, "I don't want to be in this
[1:50:02] fishbowl anymore. I don't want to be in
[1:50:04] this position, didn't I don't want to
[1:50:06] be, you know, uh uh viewed by everybody
[1:50:10] and examined by I don't want that." But
[1:50:12] she couldn't change it.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And this and this leader in in Israel
[1:50:17] said to me right in Jerusalem, "How do I
[1:50:19] become unchosen?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be chosen. We've
[1:50:23] suffered so much,
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Girsten Solomon said to me with his
[1:50:29] wife, she just stepped out and had her
[1:50:30] hand on the door on the door handle to
[1:50:32] go into the motel and and I was I was
[1:50:35] telling him, you know what brother
[1:50:36] Brandham said about the Jews, about you
[1:50:39] Jews? You know what he said about the
[1:50:40] Holocaust? He said it was the tender
[1:50:43] hand of Jehovah. You'll never hear
[1:50:46] another preacher saying that. The
[1:50:47] Holocaust, 6 million. Do you see them
[1:50:50] with nothing but their bones sticking
[1:50:52] out of their skin? I've got pictures.
[1:50:54] I've got volumes of how they constructed
[1:50:56] the buildings. I've got about six or
[1:50:59] eight volumes of the construction of the
[1:51:02] of of just uh of Awitz itself. Just that
[1:51:06] one. It's a massive construction.
[1:51:08] Thousands of people are there. And and
[1:51:10] and how they designed everything and how
[1:51:12] they designed the the ovens where they
[1:51:15] were to cremate the people. I've walked
[1:51:17] past a place where they had so many that
[1:51:20] they had slain that they just threw them
[1:51:22] into a swamp. It was incredible.
[1:51:26] And as a minister, I look at that and
[1:51:28] say the diminishing
[1:51:30] of them.
[1:51:33] Has God forgotten them? And in the
[1:51:36] context of the message today,
[1:51:39] do you think for a moment
[1:51:41] that all through that time there was
[1:51:43] nothing in them craving not just to be
[1:51:47] free from, you know,
[1:51:51] you think they didn't think about having
[1:51:53] a decent meal or just enough food or
[1:51:56] just some bread or some some soup made
[1:52:00] from cabbage or something? You think
[1:52:02] they didn't crave for that? Yes, they
[1:52:04] did. But more than that, there's an
[1:52:06] element within them that had a spiritual
[1:52:08] craving because they knew we're God's
[1:52:11] people.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; I don't understand this. I don't
[1:52:15] understand these hundreds of years of
[1:52:18] being diminished and being hated and
[1:52:21] being exterminated. I don't understand.
[1:52:24] How can I understand that my children
[1:52:27] are subjected to this? How can I
[1:52:29] understand that there's such pain? I can
[1:52:32] understand but they could never become
[1:52:34] unJewish.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; And no wonder the prophet brings it up
[1:52:45] so many times. They were blinded for our
[1:52:48] sake.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; He had such an appreciation. And this is
[1:52:52] one place I trust that we could rise to
[1:52:54] where he was today. And I don't just
[1:52:56] look at and say, "I wish I could feel
[1:52:58] that way." I want you to enter into it
[1:53:00] this morning.
[1:53:02] Thank you, Father. You blinded them so I
[1:53:06] could see. You blinded them so the
[1:53:08] gospel would come to us.
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about the calling,
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:53:24] And uh and brother Brandham, I wish I
[1:53:27] had the I wish I had the time. Can you
[1:53:29] give me a little bit of time this
[1:53:30] morning?
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; He gives a he gives a quote and he
[1:53:36] speaks about the desire that is in you.
[1:53:39] The desire that God put in you. That
[1:53:44] desire for him. God put it in you that
[1:53:47] you would crave for. You would crave for
[1:53:50] this realms of maturity. You would crave
[1:53:53] for the fulfillment of the word of God
[1:53:56] in this hour. God put it in you so that
[1:53:58] you'd crave for it.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; And when you don't see it, the craving
[1:54:03] still doesn't go away.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; When you don't attain to it, like the
[1:54:07] eagle eye, how do I fly? How do I get up
[1:54:10] there? How do I do this? Like Abraham,
[1:54:13] how do I have a child?
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; How do I have a land? He told me to walk
[1:54:19] all over this land. I've I've put my
[1:54:22] footsteps all over the land, but I I'm
[1:54:24] dying with I I'm come to my dying days,
[1:54:27] and I haven't got possession of it yet.
[1:54:29] But there was something in the seed.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; If you can give, if you can, if you can
[1:54:40] give, I'm going way out on a limb. If
[1:54:43] you can give up this message,
[1:54:47] I invite you to go ahead and do it.
[1:54:50] Right.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Biscuit, would you say
[1:54:53] that?" Yeah, I'll say that.
[1:54:56] I'll say, "If you can give up this
[1:54:57] message,
[1:54:59] if you can just turn around and deny
[1:55:01] this, God, deny this message. Say this,
[1:55:03] William Brham is not of God, go ahead
[1:55:06] and do it."
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Because even my invitation
[1:55:14] is not nearly as powerful. It's not even
[1:55:17] to be put on the same category with the
[1:55:20] life of the seed
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; that God has put.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; You'd look me right in the eye and say,
[1:55:26] "Brother Ed, I don't care what you say.
[1:55:28] I could never do it. I can never give it
[1:55:31] up. I cannot deny it. I cannot turn it
[1:55:34] aside."
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; I said, "Hallelujah.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; I've I've given you all this diminishing
[1:55:42] of the Jews because it doesn't matter.
[1:55:45] It it it it's irrelevant what we may go
[1:55:48] through and what we may be called to go
[1:55:51] through.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; I'm just taking my time for a moment.
[1:56:13] You know, friends, there's no difference
[1:56:16] between us here today. We say, "Well,
[1:56:18] this is 2010. Who cares?" There's no
[1:56:22] difference between this and I' I've
[1:56:24] already taken you from 70 AD to 2004
[1:56:29] and beyond.
[1:56:32] Those people are no different. The Jews
[1:56:34] of 70 AD that had to flee out of
[1:56:36] Jerusalem are no different than those
[1:56:38] that are living today.
[1:56:41] They have the same
[1:56:44] say, "Why can't we have peace?" And the
[1:56:47] liberal Jews, they call them liberal
[1:56:49] Jews or whatever they say, they're
[1:56:50] prepared to give up anything
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; just to have some peace. And and and and
[1:56:56] what has Christianity done? Christianity
[1:56:58] has they've given up they've given up
[1:57:01] their standards. They've given up their
[1:57:03] spiritual convictions. They've given it
[1:57:06] all up just so that they could be
[1:57:08] accepted. so that they could have a a
[1:57:10] wider acceptance so that they wouldn't
[1:57:12] be uh considered such uh offcowering or
[1:57:16] be oddballs whatever I say anybody who
[1:57:19] follows this message going to be an
[1:57:21] oddball and and we're not here just to
[1:57:24] have a little association of of uh of of
[1:57:27] people who are of like like-minded
[1:57:29] faith. We're here for something much
[1:57:31] deeper than that.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; And now I'm going to just come to give
[1:57:34] me a few more minutes here. I'm going to
[1:57:36] come to and I want to I want to focus on
[1:57:39] this that we crave. Now here a a prophet
[1:57:43] of God he comes and he speaks of the new
[1:57:47] home the heavenly home and and and it
[1:57:51] starts almost to take on the feeling to
[1:57:55] us that it's you can take this off now
[1:57:58] if you wish. It starts to take a feeling
[1:58:00] to us that it's almost like fairy tale
[1:58:03] and storybook things. Friends, it's not
[1:58:06] a fairy tale. This is not a myth. This
[1:58:09] is this is eternal things. These are
[1:58:12] more real than your physical body
[1:58:14] sitting in a seat here in this church
[1:58:16] today.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; He talks about a theophony body and that
[1:58:21] we're just a step away from the
[1:58:23] theophony body. He speaks about things
[1:58:25] that are it is as though we start to
[1:58:28] say, "Oh, it is so wonderful. How can I
[1:58:31] attain that? How can I achieve that?"
[1:58:34] And he also tells us, you can just rest
[1:58:37] in the fact that God has put it already
[1:58:40] in the seed.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; It's not you that's going to attain it.
[1:58:45] It's the life that's in the seed that's
[1:58:47] going to come to it.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; We'll fly when we're supposed to fly.
[1:58:51] We'll be changed when we're supposed to
[1:58:53] be changed.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; And from that, from then on, from here
[1:58:56] on out, whether we whether we are are
[1:58:59] diminished or whether we're thought evil
[1:59:01] of or whether we're spoken well of, that
[1:59:03] becomes irrelevant.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:59:23] I want the last.
[1:59:31] God will call his elected
[1:59:34] and that is the Jews during that time.
[1:59:38] The elected, the Bible speaks of it,
[1:59:40] Paul speaks of it. According to the
[1:59:42] election,
[1:59:43] there will be 144,000 that will believe
[1:59:46] the message out of literally millions
[1:59:49] that that'll be there. There were
[1:59:52] millions in Palestine at the days of the
[1:59:55] prophecy of Elijah and 7,000 were saved
[1:59:58] out of the millions. Now, let me just
[2:00:01] stop here. How many did Elijah think
[2:00:03] were saved?
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; How many did he think were saved? He
[2:00:08] thought that he was the only one
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; and I only remain.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet of God thought. I
[2:00:15] only remain. And God says, I've reserved
[2:00:18] to myself 7,000.
[2:00:20] There were 7,000 out there feeling the
[2:00:23] same as Elijah. Said, this isn't right.
[2:00:25] This God of Baal is not right. I have no
[2:00:28] association with it. They felt
[2:00:30] completely separated to it because there
[2:00:32] was a seed in them. There was a life in
[2:00:35] them that felt exactly like Elijah felt.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; 7,000 was saved out of the millions.
[2:00:43] Now, according to the election where
[2:00:45] millions of the Jews are gathering into
[2:00:47] their homeland, it's become a nation.
[2:00:51] There will be millions in there, but
[2:00:53] only 144,000
[2:00:56] elected ones will be taken and that will
[2:01:00] hear the message.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; I have a
[2:01:11] Just give me a moment here
[2:01:28] in the message Jehovah Gyra.
[2:01:32] He's speaking of of Abraham. He said
[2:01:35] just like he appeared to him down there,
[2:01:38] Elohim,
[2:01:39] he needed a body to come down to earth
[2:01:42] in.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; So, he just gathered up the cosmic light
[2:01:47] and the petroleum and so forth and
[2:01:49] stepped into it. See,
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; he's God.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; That's the way he'll do you.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I come here, friends. I'm st
[2:01:58] standing before a few hundred of you and
[2:02:00] and and I have a statement here. He said
[2:02:03] he stepped down.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? In Abraham's time,
[2:02:07] he stepped down
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; and he put together some elements and he
[2:02:11] stepped down into it.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; God in a human body.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say that's the way
[2:02:18] that he'll do you.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; He said after you're no more than a
[2:02:23] spoonful of ashes.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. in the dust.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; He'll still speak.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Why did he say he'll still speak?
[2:02:32] Because he's declaring he's speaking
[2:02:35] now.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; While you're here in this body, while
[2:02:39] this seed is expressing itself, why you
[2:02:41] have a certain anticipation and a
[2:02:43] certain earnest expectation of the word?
[2:02:46] Why do you have that? Because he's here
[2:02:48] now and he's calling to it. But you
[2:02:50] might be home reading the scripture. You
[2:02:52] might be listening to a message tape or
[2:02:54] you might be here as you are this
[2:02:56] morning and as you hear the word preach
[2:02:58] something is echoing deep inside like
[2:03:02] the little eagle that hears a scream. I
[2:03:04] don't understand it but I know that it
[2:03:08] means something to me.
[2:03:11] [Music]
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; I'm hearing things and I'm seeing it in
[2:03:14] a different way. I'm seeing it another
[2:03:16] light. It's because there's a seed in
[2:03:19] you. Amen.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Respect that seed. Thank God for that
[2:03:23] seed. Thank God for that nature that's
[2:03:26] in there.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; And then he's going on to say, even if
[2:03:32] you're gone and you're just a teaspoon
[2:03:34] of ashes
[2:03:39] after you're no more,
[2:03:41] he'll still speak.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; And you'll be there.
[2:03:46] As I'm I'm bas I'm prepared to say on
[2:03:49] the basis of this, your ashes
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; will respond
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; to the very voice of almighty God
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; the creator. And if your ashes will
[2:03:59] respond to it, why shouldn't we respond
[2:04:02] to it? As a living creatures, oh friends
[2:04:05] and believers, this is our opportunity.
[2:04:08] [Applause]
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; He'll call
[2:04:16] He said he'll call your name.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; When you're a sp spoonful of ashes,
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; he's not going to say Jim, Sally,
[2:04:27] Edward.
[2:04:29] He's going to call.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying is death cannot even
[2:04:34] remove that nature in the seat of God.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Death cannot remove it
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; because God put it there. and that God
[2:04:44] will call and a teaspoon of ashes will
[2:04:47] hear the call.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, believers.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a lot of teaspoon of
[2:04:54] ashes in there.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; You can go by these graveyards and
[2:04:57] they're full. It's called the city of
[2:04:58] the dead. You can go by there, it's full
[2:05:00] of people, full of teaspoons of ashes.
[2:05:03] But when God calls, there'll only be a
[2:05:05] teaspoon here and a teaspoon over there
[2:05:08] that will hear and come forth
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; because they were predestinated to it
[2:05:14] before the foundation of the world.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; He said, notice he changed his name
[2:05:24] from Abram to Abraham.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:30] I need your full attention
[2:05:32] as we're going to go into little just a
[2:05:34] little swimming water for a moment.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Now he's saying he stepped down into a
[2:05:44] body
[2:05:45] and he just called some of the elements
[2:05:47] together. Same elements he speaks of as
[2:05:49] you are made up of. He said he just he
[2:05:52] he he put those elements together and
[2:05:54] God stepped down into it.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those
[2:05:59] elements when God stepped down into it
[2:06:01] did something different than other
[2:06:03] elements that were put together of the
[2:06:05] same material.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; When he came up, there was God in that
[2:06:14] body.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Like God's in your body.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; And because God's in your body, you can
[2:06:25] say things that are different.
[2:06:27] than the average flesh and blood man or
[2:06:29] woman.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Not even Christians.
[2:06:35] I'm talking about God's in your body and
[2:06:39] and the seed that is in you
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; happen to hear a voice. And this is what
[2:06:44] this voice has said.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; He says he changed his name. He's in the
[2:06:50] same message. He's changed his name
[2:06:53] here now from Abram to Abraham which
[2:06:55] which means father of nations. He added
[2:06:58] the ham Abraham.
[2:07:02] He did this so that the complete promise
[2:07:06] could be fulfilled. That's why he came
[2:07:09] and changed it and added the ham which
[2:07:12] was the deity part to it because God was
[2:07:16] adding deity part into this age and he
[2:07:20] said go and search your history. There's
[2:07:23] never been a messenger with ham come and
[2:07:27] he goes to a graham which is six letters
[2:07:30] for the Gentiles for the church world.
[2:07:33] But he says, "Who did the bride? Who who
[2:07:36] did Abraham hear?" It was seven letters,
[2:07:39] Abraham. And as a Branham and and and
[2:07:44] Billy Graham, God bless him for his
[2:07:46] ministry. He did what he was called to
[2:07:48] do. And so did a man, William Brandham,
[2:07:50] do what he was called to do. And I have
[2:07:53] abundance. I have all kinds of quotes
[2:07:55] and things here where he begins to speak
[2:07:58] to people and tell people. He told one
[2:08:00] woman her address. And when he gave the
[2:08:02] address like it's 146 and a half,
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; he wouldn't allow it to end with the 146
[2:08:10] or house number or the street number.
[2:08:12] It's 146. He said and a half.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; I tell you, God knows where you live.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; God knows your post office box number.
[2:08:22] God knows your He knows everything about
[2:08:25] your physical being. He knows what he
[2:08:27] put into you
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; and he knows what it's going to become.
[2:08:32] [Applause]
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; He sees you sitting around the marriage
[2:08:36] table.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, it sounds so good."
[2:08:39] There's something in you says, "Oh, that
[2:08:40] sounds so good." It's not only that it
[2:08:42] sounds good. It's true.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; It's more true than the dinner you're
[2:08:49] going to have today.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:54] [Applause]
[2:08:55] And there's something inside that's
[2:08:57] calling for that.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; I've experienced things in the message.
[2:09:06] I've experienced depths of grace and
[2:09:09] I've seen the prophet ex express the
[2:09:12] grace. I've seen him live it. I've seen
[2:09:14] him display it.
[2:09:16] [Applause]
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; I'm your friend.
[2:09:22] You call me your pastor.
[2:09:25] I'm going to tell you I have I've been
[2:09:28] in port I put myself right there and
[2:09:31] I've heard him say things
[2:09:33] and I've s heard him express grace to
[2:09:36] people and I had to say
[2:09:40] I'm not there yet. I wish I was. There's
[2:09:44] something in here that's calling out for
[2:09:46] it. I wish I was there. I wish I could
[2:09:49] say it.
[2:09:53] not just not there yet. And it's not
[2:09:56] just saying, "Well, just, you know, just
[2:09:59] go ahead and do it." No, it's just
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Doesn't work that way.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; But I can say there's something in the
[2:10:05] seed.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; We're no different.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; We're God's elected.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; And there were Jews all down through the
[2:10:13] centuries that were God's elected. And
[2:10:15] they had desires within them. They had a
[2:10:17] craving. I'm not talking about a human
[2:10:19] desire. I'm talking about something.
[2:10:21] They knew they had a purpose. We know we
[2:10:24] have a purpose in the earth as Jews, as
[2:10:26] elected people. And we know we have a
[2:10:29] purpose in the earth as the bride of
[2:10:31] Jesus Christ.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't call you to be a bench warmer.
[2:10:35] He didn't call you just to be uh you
[2:10:38] know uh in a workplace. He didn't call
[2:10:40] you for that. He called you for a much
[2:10:42] deeper purpose.
[2:10:44] [Applause]
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my friend.
[2:10:50] So that the deep so that the complete
[2:10:52] promise could be fulfilled.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; And the son now that had been promised
[2:10:57] so long
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; could be seen
[2:11:00] or otherwise be revealed.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; The son
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; and was only at a time that name had to
[2:11:08] be changed.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; And it had to fit an event in your day.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah,
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; it had to fit an event when the when the
[2:11:18] Jews themselves natural be to be called
[2:11:20] back
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; and they flew in
[2:11:24] in 1948.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; There was 86,000
[2:11:29] Jews. 86,000 was the total population of
[2:11:33] Palestine
[2:11:35] as of the latest count I have is
[2:11:39] 7,411,000.
[2:11:43] That's quite an increase from eight.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Did he gather them back?
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Has that happened?
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; That's happened while you sat here in
[2:11:51] this church. That happened while you
[2:11:53] worked at your job. Here's God, the
[2:11:56] great eternal God. Why did those people
[2:11:58] leave everything and get on a plane and
[2:12:01] lay there like cord wood
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; in a great big jumbo jet freighter?
[2:12:09] No seats. They just laid there like
[2:12:12] cordwood on the floor. We say, "Well,
[2:12:15] that's against all the all the
[2:12:17] regulations of aeronautics." I tell you
[2:12:21] what, God's people in Israel, they're
[2:12:22] not even interested in what's right and
[2:12:24] what's, you know, what's, you know, the
[2:12:27] correct way of doing things. These
[2:12:29] people got to get home.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; We've got a calling.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; And they just grabbed their babies and
[2:12:34] left their homes and left whatever they
[2:12:36] had and boarded on the plane. Why was
[2:12:38] it? Because there was a call inside.
[2:12:41] I've got to go back there. And I'll tell
[2:12:43] you why they had that call. Why it was
[2:12:45] revived in this time. Because this
[2:12:47] messenger said it would be that way.
[2:12:51] [Music]
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; God doesn't do anything till he speaks
[2:12:55] it. God came down
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; and God said it.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Do you know the world is mystified yet?
[2:13:02] Why did communism fall? You should have
[2:13:04] lived. Some of you young people, you
[2:13:06] didn't live in in in a in a few few
[2:13:08] years ago. That was a major threat in
[2:13:11] the world.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; When my wife and I raising our family up
[2:13:14] in the north, we didn't know when they
[2:13:18] might come across from from Siberia to
[2:13:21] Alaska and invade.
[2:13:24] And the prophet of God said they had
[2:13:27] missiles in the air and they could land
[2:13:29] it. He said, on Fourth Street, I believe
[2:13:31] it was in Phoenix.
[2:13:36] This is not a ancient or historical
[2:13:38] gospel. This is a gospel that is right
[2:13:41] now up to this moment.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; I know. I know it's a little bit late.
[2:13:55] You'll just have to give me just a wee
[2:13:56] bit of time. Amen.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Do you think that the church age
[2:14:01] messengers and I can talk about Luther
[2:14:03] and talk about Wesley and talk about the
[2:14:06] prophet of God in this day?
[2:14:09] You know what he says?
[2:14:11] Help me now.
[2:14:14] He said he'd wondered why when he was
[2:14:17] just a kid
[2:14:19] and he saw women acting the way they
[2:14:22] were and it built up like a complex in
[2:14:24] them. even says one place he hated them,
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; But he says and he learned later that
[2:14:29] there was real sisters amongst them and
[2:14:32] good ones. He said,
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; but when he was a kid,
[2:14:37] he found and saw the direction things
[2:14:40] were going and there was a resistance
[2:14:42] and a resentment. He didn't know what to
[2:14:44] do with it.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; What was that? Wasn't wasn't something
[2:14:48] he got from his parents.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; That was something that was in that
[2:14:53] seed.
[2:14:54] says, "I am opposed to this." And then
[2:14:57] he starts his early ministry and he sees
[2:14:59] all the denominations and they're all
[2:15:01] spread and they're fighting against one
[2:15:03] another and got these walls and barriers
[2:15:05] up and he said, "I'm called to I'm
[2:15:08] called to break those down."
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; I'm called to break it down. What was
[2:15:14] it? It was a seed that was in him that
[2:15:16] was calling for that ministry. Because
[2:15:18] what I'm saying is that the seed had the
[2:15:20] nature before he even came to the place
[2:15:23] of living it and expressing it.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; The seed had the nature in it.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't fulfill it until the
[2:15:30] time came.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; All all seven of them.
[2:16:00] If I said you were in the loins of your
[2:16:02] father,
[2:16:03] that's not a surprise to us. But your
[2:16:07] father could not have fellowship with
[2:16:08] you until
[2:16:11] you were transformed
[2:16:13] into a body of flesh.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "My son was in me. I
[2:16:18] wanted a son, but he was in me then. He
[2:16:23] was in me then. But through wedlock, he
[2:16:27] was transformed
[2:16:29] into a man
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; like me. And then he becomes like me and
[2:16:35] you become like your parents
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; because it was in you to begin with.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; It was always there. That's what we're
[2:16:44] talking about. That life was in you to
[2:16:48] begin with.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to close it with a
[2:16:53] couple of a couple of statements and a
[2:16:55] couple things I want to read for you.
[2:17:06] How many know
[2:17:09] Elijah and Moses are going to come back?
[2:17:15] And they're going to have a very short
[2:17:17] ministry.
[2:17:19] Brother Brandham speaks specifically
[2:17:21] what they're going to do.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; You know what they're going to do?
[2:17:28] Call
[2:17:30] the elected
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; back to the word.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; That's the ministry.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; That's the ministry.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've heard the message.
[2:17:40] I believe the message." Do you know what
[2:17:42] you did? You know what you did? If
[2:17:44] you're a believer, you heard God call
[2:17:47] your name.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; And Job said, "He will call and I will
[2:17:52] answer him.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; I will answer him."
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Even if he was just a spoonful of ashes,
[2:17:58] he will call and I will answer. Amen.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; I look across this congregation and I
[2:18:04] know so many of you from where you came
[2:18:10] and where you lived
[2:18:12] and exactly how God did it. I'm not
[2:18:15] exactly sure.
[2:18:17] I look down and see
[2:18:20] our sister Gerta here.
[2:18:23] Her husband was a superintendent in a
[2:18:26] factory
[2:18:29] in in the Okonogan.
[2:18:33] It was a very large business and that
[2:18:36] factory went bankrupt
[2:18:40] and was advertised out to be liquidated.
[2:18:50] and brother Ken and brother Tom, brother
[2:18:52] Mike,
[2:18:54] they were appointed to liquidate it
[2:18:58] and they needed somebody
[2:19:01] the trustee needed somebody to show them
[2:19:03] the plant
[2:19:08] and they
[2:19:10] suggested
[2:19:15] and called him to be there
[2:19:18] and they got witnesses and talking to
[2:19:20] him and the next thing they did was
[2:19:23] bring a bag of tapes to him
[2:19:27] and that was it.
[2:19:29] Now, isn't that now who called?
[2:19:33] Who Who did that? Who arranged that?
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; I say to you here because
[2:19:42] this is where I'm going and I'm I'm I'm
[2:19:44] a long ways from being over, but I'm
[2:19:45] going to finish.
[2:19:48] I need you to go back.
[2:19:53] I want you to go back
[2:19:58] and identify
[2:20:01] if you can
[2:20:03] that call when God begin to deal with
[2:20:06] you and call you.
[2:20:10] Is there a time or is there a place? And
[2:20:12] if you say here today,
[2:20:14] brother Biscll, I I I really don't know
[2:20:17] when he began to call me I but I did
[2:20:20] have an awakening.
[2:20:23] Yes. And he begin to spend. So others of
[2:20:24] you might say I can remember the time
[2:20:26] and the place.
[2:20:31] And then you know who perhaps spoke to
[2:20:34] you,
[2:20:36] who prayed with you.
[2:20:44] God's never going to change his mind
[2:20:46] about that.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; He'll never change his mind. that's
[2:20:51] written down in the eternal
[2:20:54] and eternal books of almighty God.
[2:20:57] And I want to say to you before I before
[2:20:59] I close today h the fact if you can
[2:21:03] identify and say and if I asked you say
[2:21:06] did God ever speak to you did God call
[2:21:08] you.
[2:21:10] I'm not asking where you are today.
[2:21:14] I'm not asking how cold or how
[2:21:16] indifferent or how what you are. I'm not
[2:21:19] interested. I want to know, do you
[2:21:21] remember when God called you?
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; And then I will announce to you on the
[2:21:27] authority of God's word. He will never
[2:21:31] change his mind about that call.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; He will never change his mind
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; of that call and how it came.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; He'll never change his mind.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Almighty God,
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; father calling for his seed, calling for
[2:21:48] his children.
[2:21:51] And if you become nothing more than a
[2:21:53] teaspoon of dust, brother Ernie, in in
[2:21:56] the earth, you'll still hear his voice
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; because God will not repent for the
[2:22:01] gifts and the calling of God is without
[2:22:05] repentance.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; He will never take it back.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; He'll never repent over having called
[2:22:12] you. Can you say
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; amen?
[2:22:16] Glory, glory, glory.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; Can I close with this?
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; Your new life
[2:22:35] is in the Lamb's book of life.
[2:22:41] There's things in the scripture.
[2:22:43] Brother Brandham said he was scared
[2:22:45] about death.
[2:22:47] There's things in the scripture
[2:22:49] that are very, very serious.
[2:22:52] Says we'll give account for every deed
[2:22:55] and for every word.
[2:23:00] I've never I thank God by his grace.
[2:23:03] I've never lived in deep sin. But that's
[2:23:05] that's irrelevant. I shake hands or wash
[2:23:09] feet with I don't care. I don't care
[2:23:12] what you did in your life.
[2:23:14] I don't care where you've been.
[2:23:17] The blood that cleansed me
[2:23:20] didn't change when it cleansed somebody
[2:23:22] else.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; It didn't have to become more potent. It
[2:23:26] didn't have to go back and get
[2:23:28] strengthened another dose. What cleansed
[2:23:31] one cleansed another one.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and brother Brandham says
[2:23:37] this, and I'm I'm glad he says it right
[2:23:39] towards the end of his life and towards
[2:23:40] the end of his ministry and towards the
[2:23:42] end of the age he was sent to minister
[2:23:44] in. And he says this,
[2:23:49] "Your name
[2:23:51] of your first nature
[2:23:54] was born and put in a book and all a ll
[2:24:00] your deeds were wrote in it too."
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:05] Everything you've done under that nature
[2:24:08] was put in a book called the book of
[2:24:11] life.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; Now he said your old book is gone.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; What does he he's ministering the
[2:24:20] invisible union of the bride to the
[2:24:23] bridegroom.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; And something has happened. Friends,
[2:24:27] young people, whoever you are, use your
[2:24:30] mind this morning. Pinch your conscience
[2:24:32] and say, "God, give me an understanding.
[2:24:34] Cause me to grasp this
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; and your old book is gone
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; with your old union.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; We're not united to Satan any longer.
[2:24:47] We're not He's not our taskmaster any
[2:24:50] longer. We've been freed from him. And
[2:24:53] the same power that freed you from him
[2:24:56] took your book, your old book under the
[2:24:59] nature, under your old nature,
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; it's gone. He says, "And now your name,
[2:25:09] your old, your old has been transferred.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; And now he said, now you say, do you
[2:25:16] mean to tell me that my old book?" And
[2:25:19] he breaks the sentence. God put it in
[2:25:21] the sea of his forgetfulness. You stand
[2:25:24] perfectly before God.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; Now you're now your name is now in the
[2:25:31] new book.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Not the book of life, but the lamb's
[2:25:36] book of life.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; The difference between the book of life
[2:25:39] and the lamb's book of life, there's one
[2:25:41] major difference, and it's blood.
[2:25:46] And there's only one thing that could
[2:25:48] erase what came by our old nature was
[2:25:52] blood.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Not church, not doctrine, not preaching.
[2:25:57] Blood.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Blood.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Erased it. It's the perfect delete.
[2:26:06] [Applause]
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; You have to believe that. Yeah,
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; you must accept that.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Whether you feel in need of it or not,
[2:26:16] that's irrelevant. You do need it.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "What the lamb redeemed,
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; not the old book of your natural union,
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; but your new bride,
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; your new life,
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; is in the lamb's book of life,
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; your marriage certificate.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe you and I need to take
[2:26:39] a look at the marriage certificate
[2:26:40] today.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Your marriage certificate
[2:26:44] [Applause]
[2:26:46] [Music]
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; where your true
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; eternal
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; germ
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; from the beginning takes hold.
[2:26:57] [Music]
[2:26:59] It is based on this
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; that he continues to say and this is we
[2:27:06] repeat this. We've quoted it. I've heard
[2:27:08] all kinds of people read it. I've read
[2:27:10] it myself. Do I grasp? Now you'll catch
[2:27:14] the whole thought of my message. Do I
[2:27:17] grasp it all? Not completely.
[2:27:23] How did you come to do this? Right.
[2:27:28] God,
[2:27:33] how did you come to do this?
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; You were deceived into it.
[2:27:45] by your first marriage
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; to your adulterous parent Eve.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; It's no fault of your own.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; By your natural birth, you came after
[2:28:04] Eve who committed adultery.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason you were born an
[2:28:10] adulteress.
[2:28:12] You were a sinner to begin with.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; He said you were deceived into it.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; No, he said it ain't your fault. I tell
[2:28:21] you what, friends,
[2:28:23] in my mind,
[2:28:26] it's very hard for me to go there. I'm
[2:28:29] I'm being honest with you. It's hard for
[2:28:32] me to go there.
[2:28:36] I'm telling you. And I'm telling you
[2:28:38] because I believe you are no different.
[2:28:42] There's things in this message that are
[2:28:44] so powerful.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; It's hard to go there.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; It's hard to go there. And when you can
[2:28:51] say, "Oh, yeah. Well, it's them or it's
[2:28:53] out in the world or it's in another
[2:28:55] church." But if it is your neighbor
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; or one sitting next to you
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; or your children or whatever more, then
[2:29:03] put this into practice.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, that was a lesser amen than I
[2:29:10] expected. This doesn't lose its effect
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; simply because oh, this is in another
[2:29:16] church or this is in another family or
[2:29:17] this is in another place. This has the
[2:29:20] same effect.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; And that's why it's hard for me to go
[2:29:24] there. But there's something inside of
[2:29:26] me.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; There is something inside of me that
[2:29:32] keeps crying out, I want to go there.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; I want to have that capacity.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; I want to be able to to address. I want
[2:29:46] to be able to embrace the forgiven.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; You were deceived into it.
[2:30:04] And it ain't your fault.
[2:30:07] How about the next one? You never did
[2:30:10] it.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; You can say
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Or you can say, I do believe that.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; Or you can say, God, help me to believe
[2:30:24] it.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; Help me to go there. Amen.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; There's something within me that says
[2:30:29] that truly
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; is the power of the blood of Jesus
[2:30:34] Christ.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; That's the power of the blood.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Not to live in sin. No, that's is
[2:30:41] absolutely
[2:30:42] that's absolutely untrue. It's not to
[2:30:45] live in sin. It's to be delivered from
[2:30:47] it.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; To be free from it.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:02] You never did it. He didn't stop there.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; I stopped there for a purpose.
[2:31:09] He said, "You never did it because
[2:31:14] that little germ that was in you was to
[2:31:17] be you before the foundation of the
[2:31:20] world.
[2:31:23] Amen.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; God put your name in the lamb's book of
[2:31:27] life.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; So, do you see how that all ties
[2:31:30] together? God put your name in the
[2:31:32] lamb's book of life. So, he put a germ
[2:31:34] in you that would represent what he put
[2:31:37] in the lamb's book of life.
[2:31:39] You couldn't be in the lamb's book of
[2:31:41] life unforgiven. You couldn't be in the
[2:31:43] lamb's book of life marred and dirty and
[2:31:46] unclean. You had to be there cleansed by
[2:31:48] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:31:52] For God so loved the world, he gave his
[2:31:54] only begotten son. There was no other
[2:31:57] way.
[2:32:01] [Music]
[2:32:01] [Applause]
[2:32:06] [Music]
[2:32:09] Brother Brandham was asked, "Brother
[2:32:10] Brandham," he said, "I'm closing now."
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; Are you worthy of that?
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; No. He said, "You think I'm worthy?" "Do
[2:32:21] you think the bishop's worthy?" "No."
[2:32:26] "I ever a man worthy?"
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; No. There's nobody here worthy.
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; If Brother Brandham wasn't worthy, none
[2:32:33] of us are worthy. Right.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; It's not based on worthiness.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; You're an heir.
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; You're an heir.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you were the biggest
[2:32:48] drunkard in the world and your father
[2:32:50] left you a million dollars, whether
[2:32:52] you're worthy or not, it's it's his
[2:32:54] heir."
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're the heir of your
[2:32:57] father's heritage."
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; Whatever he left you, it's yours.
[2:33:04] whether you're worthy or not.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; He left it to you.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I was a sinner."
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a sinner.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; But an heir.
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; I was no good. Not yet.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; But still, I'm an heir.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; I should die and go to hell, but I'm an
[2:33:25] heir.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Can you go there?
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Can you go there?
[2:33:31] Can you actually go there?
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "If I die and go to hell,
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; I'm an heir." Now, that's a man that has
[2:33:40] his absolute confidence in the word of
[2:33:42] God.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, God, if he takes me to
[2:33:46] hell, he's got to deliver me out of hell
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm still an air.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Can you go there?
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? That's what he
[2:33:56] said in invisible union. That's because
[2:33:58] it's so powerful. There's nothing that
[2:34:00] can come. So what shall separate us from
[2:34:02] the love of God?
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; I'm still an air.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; I regardless of how diminished you might
[2:34:13] have been, regardless of how backwards
[2:34:14] things have gone, I want you to be able
[2:34:16] to say, "I'm still an air.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; I lost my job. I'm still an air. I'm
[2:34:26] going bankrupt. I'm still an air. Yeah,
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; I'm depressed and despondent. I'm still
[2:34:32] an air
[2:34:34] [Applause]
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; folks. I'm not preaching. I'm not
[2:34:38] preaching for my health. I'm preaching
[2:34:40] for your health.
[2:34:42] [Music]
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Roy.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; We're going to rejoice in this.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; This is God's infallible word.
[2:34:52] [Applause]
[2:34:54] You're hes and partakers
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; of the divine nature.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; I'm an heir to what? He said, eternal
[2:35:07] life.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; How do you know we're going to get it?
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; I feel it. And the Holy Spirit brought
[2:35:13] it.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; And Jesus rose from the dead so I could
[2:35:16] come.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; So it could come. And now it's come. And
[2:35:20] it bears record and vindicates just
[2:35:22] exactly what it said it would do. I've
[2:35:25] passed from death unto life.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; I become a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; Then I'm an heir.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Notice he said it was God.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; This is in the communion message.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; It was God.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; It was what God did.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; It what God called.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You had no will to call.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; You could have had no desire to call
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; because your nature was completely
[2:35:57] contrary to it.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; But by God's election,
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; God by election called you.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; If you've heard the call, then you know
[2:36:08] elections in place. God by election
[2:36:11] called you.
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:15] [Applause]
[2:36:18] and turned you around and set your
[2:36:21] affections towards Christ and things
[2:36:24] above.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:36:40] [Music]
[2:36:45] Once in a while, it's good for us to
[2:36:47] look
[2:36:49] at things that are so potent.
[2:36:51] And it's good to be able to confess,
[2:36:54] I'm not there yet.
[2:36:57] I'm maybe not soaring in the heavenlies
[2:37:00] like the little eagle wanted to.
[2:37:04] And I saw it all through the scripture.
[2:37:07] Saw Abraham craving the sun and craving
[2:37:10] the land. Moses,
[2:37:14] he had such he looked out on his
[2:37:16] brethren. He saw them in such bondage.
[2:37:18] He saw them in such so burdened. He saw
[2:37:21] them whipped. He saw them just degraded.
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; Talk about diminished. And he killed a
[2:37:28] man over it and became a murderer.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; Was that a mistake? I guess so.
[2:37:39] I don't care what kind of mistakes
[2:37:40] you've committed.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; It will not change God's opinion
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; of his calling.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Will not change.
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; Moses did not become de Moses
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; when he killed a man. And when he was a
[2:37:55] man of temper and he struck a rock twice
[2:37:58] and broke the broke the line. He didn't
[2:38:00] become non-M Moses anymore. He still was
[2:38:03] Moses.
[2:38:05] And David took Ba Sheba and committed
[2:38:08] adultery. But he was not he didn't
[2:38:10] become david anymore. He still was
[2:38:13] David.
[2:38:14] &gt;&gt; And he still was king.
[2:38:16] [Applause]
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; And Samuel and how many others
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; I could speak of and it never changed
[2:38:27] God's mind. All right.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul,
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; he said because of what he spoken,
[2:38:32] because of the life he lived in, because
[2:38:34] maybe he was sharp and little hook-nosed
[2:38:36] Jew as a as a prophet of God spoke to
[2:38:38] him. And he said, "All men have left
[2:38:40] me."
[2:38:44] Do you think that that gained him any
[2:38:46] popularity points? No.
[2:38:49] But did it change God's mind about Paul?
[2:38:53] Not one iota.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. Do you know why? Those
[2:38:57] that had heard him, I hope you're
[2:38:59] spiritual now. Those that had heard him,
[2:39:02] those that had heard the gospel through
[2:39:04] him, and those who had the elected
[2:39:06] predestinated seed in them and had
[2:39:08] responded to that, that was eternally in
[2:39:10] God's books.
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; And it could never and never will be
[2:39:14] changed.
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; That's all part
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; of this great plan.
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Let's stand to our
[2:39:39] feet. You've been sitting a long time.
[2:39:40] Thank you for your patience.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, oh Lord, for the seed.
[2:39:50] Thank you for the nature of the seed.
[2:39:53] Thank you that eternal life has a nature
[2:39:57] in it and it cannot be quenched.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; It cannot be derailed.
[2:40:03] Oh God, that life will forever. It will
[2:40:06] forever forever. Oh God, let me declare
[2:40:09] it. Lord Jesus, in the name of thus
[2:40:11] sayith the Lord, your word will never
[2:40:14] never cease to be and cease and diminish
[2:40:18] in its strength. It will it'll
[2:40:20] accomplish what it was set out to do.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:40:32] How about Brother Ryan? I feel feel the
[2:40:35] pull. I hear the call. I feel the pull.
[2:40:48] I hear the call
[2:40:52] [Music]
[2:40:54] and his spirit
[2:40:58] moving
[2:40:59] me to give my all.
[2:41:07] He's speaking to me.
[2:41:13] And I
[2:41:17] [Music]
[2:41:19] Lord, please come and take control.
[2:41:25] I feel the
[2:41:31] I feel the
[2:41:35] Let's just worship him now. I I hear the
[2:41:40] voice
[2:41:44] and his spirit
[2:41:47] moving me to him my own.
[2:41:56] He speaks to me
[2:42:01] and I am free.
[2:42:08] Lord, please come and take control.
[2:42:14] I hear the world.
[2:42:19] The writer here says, "And I agree."
[2:42:23] And I agree.
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:28] I know that I've been some time in this
[2:42:30] service today, but I felt for myself
[2:42:34] it's a
[2:42:36] it's a landmark message for myself
[2:42:40] and I'm trying to share it with you and
[2:42:43] I think this is a a major stepping stone
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; here in this congregation. We do not
[2:42:48] want to treat this place as merely a
[2:42:50] gathering place for service on Sunday
[2:42:53] morning. I want you to be loyal.
[2:42:56] Come to Wednesday night service.
[2:42:59] I want you to be loyal. Come to prayer
[2:43:02] service if you're able. I understand
[2:43:04] there are those who drive a long ways
[2:43:06] and I understand that. I want you to be
[2:43:09] loyal in your giving. The prophet
[2:43:12] teaches tithing,
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; does he not? He teaches tithing and he
[2:43:19] will bless according to his word. It's
[2:43:22] not it's not that God needs your money.
[2:43:25] It's not that the church needs it.
[2:43:27] That's God's order. That's God's. And
[2:43:30] you you come to the house of God. You
[2:43:33] come to contribute of your own self, of
[2:43:36] your own spiritual being. You come to
[2:43:39] contribute with that. Do so.
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; When do I start giving? When you start
[2:43:45] earning.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; When you first begin to earn, that's
[2:43:49] when you start to give. And God will and
[2:43:52] furthermore the prophet said it is a
[2:43:54] form of worship. You are worshiping in
[2:43:57] your giving.
[2:43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; The congregation can say amen to that.
[2:44:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:44:07] [Music]
[2:44:09] I'd like you to agree.
[2:44:11] [Music]
[2:44:13] And
[2:44:17] I guess having been many many places and
[2:44:19] I draw on so many experiences that I've
[2:44:22] I've had, but I do know of churches that
[2:44:26] had more people in it than we've got
[2:44:28] here today
[2:44:31] that was padlocked after a service
[2:44:34] and the people were never permitted to
[2:44:36] use that again. Do you know what also I
[2:44:39] know about that?
[2:44:41] 600 people who were there worshiping
[2:44:44] were reduced to about 90
[2:44:47] when it was over. When the persecution
[2:44:50] was over or when the persecution was
[2:44:52] taking place, it was about 90.
[2:44:56] I'm not standing here for my health. I'm
[2:44:58] standing here for the health of this
[2:45:00] body of people. Make sure that you're
[2:45:02] not here just for fellowship.
[2:45:05] &gt;&gt; Make sure that you're not here just to
[2:45:06] go to church. That's not why we're here.
[2:45:09] Make sure that you're here because you
[2:45:11] say, "I'm an heir.
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; I'm here because he called me.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; And I heard his voice. It's not brother
[2:45:19] Biscll. It's not anyone else in the
[2:45:20] church. I heard the voice of God." And
[2:45:23] he'll never change that.
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; Once again, let's just sing it once
[2:45:31] again.
[2:45:33] I feel the world.
[2:45:39] I hear the
[2:45:43] [Music]
[2:45:48] spirit
[2:45:50] moving me to give my heart.
[2:45:59] He speaks to me
[2:46:06] and I
[2:46:08] [Music]
[2:46:13] Lord please come and take control.
[2:46:19] I feel the
[2:46:24] [Music]
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads for a moment.
[2:46:28] Father,
[2:46:31] there may be those and no doubt is
[2:46:34] perhaps most of the congregation
[2:46:37] would say in all truth and honesty.
[2:46:40] [Music]
[2:46:42] I feel that very deep unexplainable
[2:46:46] craving and hunger. I hear the prophet's
[2:46:50] voice. I see things in the word of God
[2:46:54] and I crave. I can say with the psalmist
[2:46:58] David, as the heart panth after the
[2:47:01] waterbrooks, so pandeth my soul after
[2:47:05] you. We hunger and thirst after
[2:47:08] righteousness. Oh God, when I read of
[2:47:11] the righteousness that Apostle Paul
[2:47:13] speaks of when I read of the
[2:47:15] righteousness and the purity and the
[2:47:17] holiness. Oh God, how my soul craves and
[2:47:20] cries out for that place. When we say,
[2:47:23] "Oh God," in the words of Jesus in his
[2:47:25] prayer, "Thy kingdom come."
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:29] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom of justice and purity and
[2:47:31] holiness, thy kingdom where the
[2:47:34] seraphims can only say, "Holy, holy,
[2:47:37] holy, holy is the Lord." Oh God, give us
[2:47:41] an understanding. Give us a scope of
[2:47:44] vision, Lord, today. Let the people not
[2:47:47] go out of this place as the same as they
[2:47:49] walked in. But may they indeed have
[2:47:52] received something of such substance,
[2:47:55] transforming power. I pray, oh Holy
[2:47:58] Spirit, transform.
[2:48:01] Transform us, oh God. And we are asking
[2:48:05] you that you'll transform us, oh God,
[2:48:07] into the image that you've desired that
[2:48:09] we should be. Let us rise to that level
[2:48:12] of maturity. I pray in Jesus Christ's
[2:48:16] name. In Jesus Christ's name. And if
[2:48:20] you're would like to just
[2:48:23] [Music]
[2:48:24] perhaps identify yourself or just want
[2:48:27] to lift your heart, your hand before
[2:48:29] God. Let us let us sing this prayer
[2:48:33] together. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord
[2:48:36] and I'll be quick to answer you.
[2:48:41] Sweet my
[2:48:44] [Music]
[2:48:48] sweet
[2:48:50] my
[2:48:55] sweet and I'll be quick to answer.
[2:49:06] Speak my Lord.
[2:49:10] Oh sweet oh God. Speak my Lord.
[2:49:18] Oh sweet and I will answer.
[2:49:25] Lord send me
[2:49:29] prayer now to him. Oh
[2:49:32] my Lord.
[2:49:34] Speak to me, Lord.
[2:49:37] Speak my Lord.
[2:49:43] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[2:49:54] Speak my Lord.
[2:49:58] Speak Lord. Speak my Lord. Oh,
[2:50:08] speaking and I will answer.
[2:50:13] Lord,
[2:50:14] send me.
[2:50:16] [Music]
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I pray that God will
[2:50:24] [Music]
[2:50:25] take the advantage
[2:50:28] every opportunity
[2:50:31] in the coming days in your individual
[2:50:33] life regardless of your
[2:50:36] age or position or status that he'll
[2:50:39] speak to you
[2:50:41] and he'll speak back
[2:50:44] [Music]
[2:50:50] sometimes.
[2:50:52] Did you ever feel unworthy?
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; I guess we all have.
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; I did this morning before I came to
[2:50:58] church.
[2:51:00] I knelt to pray about the service that
[2:51:02] God would
[2:51:05] and when I read of even some of our
[2:51:08] Jewish friends and they were explaining
[2:51:10] why
[2:51:12] why they won't even attempt to utter the
[2:51:15] word the name of God.
[2:51:20] I really was spoken to very very deep.
[2:51:23] They said because
[2:51:25] as humans we're not worthy to utter his
[2:51:29] name.
[2:51:30] And I said God
[2:51:33] even though we don't have a Jewish faith
[2:51:36] they have something of respect.
[2:51:39] And I hear people use the name of God
[2:51:42] and they use it in their business and
[2:51:44] give their all kinds of titles and I
[2:51:46] think how you know what a what a shame
[2:51:49] how disrespectful it is. I think God
[2:51:52] give me that kind of respect. I I knelt
[2:51:55] down to pray.
[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; And felt so unworthy.
[2:52:00] And so I came to the pulpit today not
[2:52:03] feeling like some great
[2:52:07] servant of Christ. I come here feeling
[2:52:09] very unworthy.
[2:52:12] I felt unworthy for his call
[2:52:15] the first time, but I remember it.
[2:52:19] And you know, it was just after I
[2:52:22] answered God's call and said, "Here's my
[2:52:24] life. I fell in love with something. I
[2:52:26] loved your testimony, Brother Daniel.
[2:52:29] And I've mentioned it several times. I
[2:52:32] was so moved when your mother told you
[2:52:34] stories out of the Bible and your daddy
[2:52:36] who was a Catholic and was opposed to
[2:52:39] your learning. His daddy was a doctor
[2:52:42] and his daddy was against him and
[2:52:44] against Christianity, against the
[2:52:46] message, but his mother told him stories
[2:52:49] of Jesus out of the Bible. And he said
[2:52:52] he fell in love with God. That touched
[2:52:55] me so deep, brother Daniel. He said,
[2:52:57] "You fell in love with God." And then he
[2:53:00] says he went on and sometime later in
[2:53:02] his life still a young man just a young
[2:53:04] man in his teens. He was just a boy
[2:53:06] then.
[2:53:08] And later on in his teens he heard about
[2:53:11] the message that God had sent. And when
[2:53:13] he heard the message he said it just
[2:53:15] caused him to love God more.
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; I let those things speak to me. Brother
[2:53:21] Daniel, I let those things speak to me
[2:53:23] very very deep. I want to love him. And
[2:53:27] it it spoke to me so deep when I could
[2:53:29] hear
[2:53:31] brother Brandham say,
[2:53:35] "Am I worthy?" "No."
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; I said, "Brother Brandon, that's me."
[2:53:40] "No, but I'm an heir."
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; I'll just tell you this now and we'll
[2:53:46] close in prayer.
[2:53:48] And I hope you can go and think of these
[2:53:50] things. young people
[2:53:52] are just a young man
[2:53:55] struggling to understand the scriptures.
[2:53:57] And I know that brother Brandham knew my
[2:53:59] big questions. I knew that he knew that.
[2:54:02] I knew that he could look down. I was
[2:54:04] just hoping he wouldn't point his finger
[2:54:05] at me saying, "You hypocrite
[2:54:09] walking out here with me and hunting
[2:54:11] with me and got those big questions and
[2:54:13] think maybe even have false doctrine." I
[2:54:15] was expecting that.
[2:54:18] He said, "Brother Eddie,
[2:54:22] the next time that you're in prayer
[2:54:28] and you feel him, draw real close to
[2:54:31] him, to me, to you." So, would you give
[2:54:34] him a message for me?
[2:54:37] And I'm just looking at him because I I
[2:54:39] can't comprehend how I'm going to give a
[2:54:42] message to the Lord Jesus.
[2:54:46] And he says, "The next time he draws
[2:54:48] near and you feel him real close to
[2:54:49] you," he says, 'W will you do something
[2:54:51] for me? I said, ' Okay. He said, "Tell
[2:54:55] him that brother Bill loves him very
[2:54:58] much."
[2:55:02] You talk about unworthy.
[2:55:05] You talk about unworthy. I felt like
[2:55:07] draw crawling under the moss out in the
[2:55:11] woods.
[2:55:12] Tell him Brother Bill loves him very
[2:55:14] much.
[2:55:15] [Music]
[2:55:18] None of us here are worthy.
[2:55:22] &gt;&gt; But I want you to go back to the
[2:55:23] original call where God called you.
[2:55:27] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't had him call, I
[2:55:31] wouldn't do anything in this life. I'd
[2:55:33] cry out to him with everything that was
[2:55:34] in you. Say, "Oh God,
[2:55:38] you call and I will answer."
[2:55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:55:46] Speak my Lord.
[2:55:52] Speak.
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; Speak my
[2:55:55] [Music]
[2:56:00] speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[2:56:10] Speak my Lord.
[2:56:16] Speak my Lord.
[2:56:24] Speak and I will answer. Lord send me.
[2:56:35] My dear Lord Jesus,
[2:56:37] [Music]
[2:56:40] you are so so very very precious and
[2:56:43] very near.
[2:56:47] You have come and I I believe that you
[2:56:49] have spoken
[2:56:52] to the people that you ordained would be
[2:56:54] here today. No one is here by accident.
[2:56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:59] &gt;&gt; And I do ask that you will speak. Lord,
[2:57:01] I I've prayed
[2:57:04] earlier today and I'm praying now that
[2:57:06] you'll speak to me.
[2:57:10] Reveal yourself to us, Lord.
[2:57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:14] &gt;&gt; Reveal yourself, Lord. I feel that
[2:57:15] there's so so much yet that we need to
[2:57:19] rise to and we want to attain to. I pray
[2:57:22] that you will make it and mark the
[2:57:25] people indelibly brand their hearts and
[2:57:29] minds and souls that he that began a
[2:57:32] good work is able to finish it and that
[2:57:36] you will complete it. You will bring it
[2:57:39] to its conclusion. You'll bring every
[2:57:41] son and daughter to adoption. You'll
[2:57:44] bring us, oh God, into that rapture
[2:57:47] condition. And as we're hearing the
[2:57:49] word, may we, Lord, let our soul cry
[2:57:52] out. May we, oh God, give way to the
[2:57:57] hunger and thirst within our soul. We
[2:58:00] perhaps have desires that are within the
[2:58:04] realm of the natural man, things that we
[2:58:06] want to do, things we want to achieve
[2:58:08] and accomplish. I'm asking Lord that
[2:58:12] you'll so speak that the people will
[2:58:15] allow the things of this life to take a
[2:58:18] lower place and and be and just let it
[2:58:22] pale in it in its importance Lord so
[2:58:26] that it will be the things that we we
[2:58:29] that you have desired for us oh God call
[2:58:33] speak don't let us get away from it oh
[2:58:36] God speak after we leave the building
[2:58:39] today Lord Lord, speak while we're in
[2:58:41] our home and in our car. And if needs
[2:58:44] be, speak in the middle of the night, oh
[2:58:46] God. Speak and we will answer you. Jesus
[2:58:52] Christ, in your name, I ask your
[2:58:55] blessings upon this people. Father God
[2:58:58] of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of
[2:59:00] Jacob, God of Israel, go with this
[2:59:03] people, I pray, and may they rise to a
[2:59:09] whole new level and stature in the
[2:59:12] stature of the perfect man. Jesus,
[2:59:15] Jesus, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[2:59:19] Thank you, Lord.
[2:59:21] Thank you, Lord.
[2:59:24] You're dismissed in Jesus name. and just
[2:59:26] obey his voice. If you feel to get away
[2:59:29] quietly someplace, go ahead and do that.
[2:59:32] I want to just say we'll walk in the
[2:59:37] light.
[2:59:39] What a beautyful
[2:59:41] light
[2:59:44] where the doom drops of mercies
[2:59:50] are bright.
[2:59:53] shine all around us
[2:59:58] by day and by night.
[3:00:02] It's Jesus
[3:00:05] who light on the world.
[3:00:09] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[3:00:11] name. Trust you'll have a glorious time.
[3:00:15] Tell us next Wednesday night will be the
[3:00:17] first time we'll be gathering back.
[3:00:18] Brother Tim Dawn will be with us on
[3:00:21] Wednesday night and next Sunday. Have
[3:00:23] two meetings next Sunday. You're
[3:00:25] dismissed in Jesus name. God bless you.
