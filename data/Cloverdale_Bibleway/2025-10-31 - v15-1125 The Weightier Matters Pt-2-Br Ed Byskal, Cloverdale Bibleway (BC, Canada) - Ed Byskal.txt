========================================
You may take the multitude. Turn the water into the ground. Come down. body Christy. You may be save the lamb will take together at his side. All the host of heaven will assemble me. Oh son and Jesus turn you fall down. Amen. Let's all stand. I'd like to sing the last verse again. I just I was listening to the preach this afternoon and brother Bradam sang that at the end and of course he focused on this verse. Soon the lamb will take his bride and that's why we're here. Amen. We're looking forward to the lamb stepping forth and claiming his own. Amen. claiming what he has redeemed. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And we believe he's doing that even now. Amen. Rapture season, we're in it. It's in process. &gt;&gt; The bride is putting on the word, being clothed by it. Amen. Let's sing it. Soon the lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side. All the hosts of heaven will assemble me. Oh son all the things and when he say oh come and die come and die to hungry. fall now. Come and die. Oh, come and die. Come and die. You made the peace table all night. To turn the water into wine to the hungry cause now. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's sing. All hail King Jesus. All hail Emanuel. All hail King Jesus. All hail man. bright and eternity. I'm going to praise him and forever long I will reign with you Jesus anywhere. Lord, bright morning and eternity. I'm going to praise him and forever more I will reign with him. &gt;&gt; While the music continually plays, just going to ask brother John Andy's to come and lead us to the throne of grace. And we have a testimony here tonight. Brother Rob Red Path writes in that he'd like to thank us for our prayers for the congregation and the saints. U his employer has called him back to work. So we just want to give thanks to the Lord for that. God is supplying his needs. Amen. We're so happy that God is the great I am and he's very aware of what we have need of present help in the time of need. Would you come, brother John, please? Let's just lift our hearts up in praise. If you'd like to lift your hand, he sees thanksgiving. Heavenly Father, we just love you tonight. We're such under anticipation since Sunday even to come here tonight and hear the word of God. Say, and confess publicly that we believe. So much unbelief and darkness in this land, but you've given us a heart to believe. We're not struggling or confused. You've turned on the light, Lord. I pray tonight you'd shine on a great light even further. Take us deeper. Take us, Lord. Even uh it's not just the bread and the and the loaves and fishes that we have been turned to you. It's not the miracles and signs and wonders. It's the word of God that's tugged on our souls and have kept kept us over the years in the good times and the bad times. We're just here to give you glory tonight. As we've heard over the years, it's we're not going to make it in by the skin of our teeth. We believe we're going in in waves of glory. There might be a lot of things happening in the body or in the spirit, but our souls are hanging on to thus sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah. strengthen the bride tonight, Lord. May the carcass, Lord, may the eagles tonight, from the youngest to the oldest, just learn as we've been trained to feed on the body word of the son of man. For you've come in this hour revealing yourself, revealing who we are, revealing our healer, our provider. We want to thank you with our brother Rob that you provided, Lord. &gt;&gt; You provided for all of us, Lord. When we make it on the other side, we're going to look back and you have cared for us just fine over the years. We are going to make it by the grace of God. Tonight's a refreshment. We've already sent your spirit here. We want to lay aside our busy lives, our schedules. The hassle that might be in our spirits or some distraction. We just lay it all down right now at your feet, Jesus. For in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, when these bodies are going to be changed, nothing down here is really going to matter anymore. Father, let us come up into that other dimension and just begin to pull and exercise our faith. Lord, there's needs, hands are lifted up, Lord. Some in pray, some in with needs in their lives that we're asking you to come tonight and minister. You know the thoughts and intents of our hearts. May the sharp two-edged sword come down into that soul of ours, Lord. Maybe somebody could drop their water pot tonight and say, "I'm healed. I'm delivered. It's over." God's put driven down a stake in my life and I'm claiming that right till the body change. Lord, we love you tonight. Strengthen all of us. We're just a family in this Thanksgiving time and we're here to give you glory. Bless our pastor. Strengthen him. May he mount up with wings like an eagle. And may the eagle anointing come through this building tonight and minister to each one of our hearts. Lord, we're hungry to see the third pull in action. We are thirsty, Lord, more and more to see the opening of the word, Jesus. This is not a Wednesday night service. This is a time for the burden of the word of the Lord to be put onto our hearts, onto our shoulders, God. We want to take these weightier manners, Lord, and we don't want to go back to where we used to be. But this is a time for the change. Greater things are right here among us. May we grab a hold of it like real mature eagles and drink from this body word. Lord, bless every part of the service and for answering our prayers. We give you glory. We give you thanksgiving. We give you first place in our lives in Jesus Christ's name. We thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have your seats. Just feel a great anticipation here tonight. And we're looking forward to our pastor speaking to us again carrying on from Sunday and looking forward to the word. And I've been wanting to sing this song together. and we'll invite Brother Ed to come on out and break thou the bread of life. We're going to feed on the bread of life. Amen. We are feeding. Amen. Break thou the bread of life, dear Lord, to me. As thou did it break the bread beside the sea. Beyond the sage I seek thee, Lord. My spirit pass for thee. Holy word. All right. All right. Let's try verse two. Pray bless thou the truth dear Lord to me to me as thou did bless the bread by ge shall all bond All feeders fall and I shall find my peace, my all in all. Teach me to live, dear, Lord, only for thee. as side by side in G. All my struggles then victory won. I shall be holy, Lord, the living one. I have to apologize to the musicians. I make them sweat sometimes and I choose some songs we're not we don't sing too often. So, I I do apologize. Trust you'll forgive me. Let's all stand together and sing fill my cup Lord as our pastor would come. Fill my cup Lord. I come away this mercy on my soul. Great heaven. I want no and one more time. Oh my I kind of my soul They are still I want my home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'm confident he'll do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'll just turn my power on, I'm sure he'll turn the power on. &gt;&gt; Do we have power? Good. Good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, this is a Wednesday night and uh we're in great expectation. If you you read some of the things I've read, uh I said there's enough to make the an atheist a believer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I had to I had to even read I just had to read one or two things to the brothers in the study before we came out and it was wonderful, wasn't it? Yeah. Amen. Amen. I want to before we turn to a scripture, uh God bless you, brother Gary. Thinking about you today. Amen. Uh, I want to turn to a scripture, but before I do, I'd like to sing many things about tomorrow because that's from my heart. I don't seem to understand, but I know who holds tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And yet, I know he holds my hand. And that's what's important. Can you sing that from the depths of your heart? Help us out, brother Nathan. about tomorrow. I don't see Oh, and I know you Oh, and I love you. Hold my hand and the people can say amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for the songs that have been sung and the prayers have have been prayed and the people have journeyed to the service. We pray now you will meet us. You're the supernatural God and anything you do is supernatural. We hear the testimonies from afar. We hear the testimonies that are near. We hear the testimonies, oh God, that you did long ago and you're still doing today because you're the same yesterday, today, and forever by the Holy Spirit. Inspire faith from your word now in Jesus Christ's name. Anoint us for service. We pray. Amen. Amen. I'll have you turn in your Bibles. I'm going to be continuing on with the burden of the word uh part two. But uh uh the service tonight will be perhaps quite different in that uh I want to raise a few questions because questions causes a person to ponder and when you ponder it opens up your heart and mind to the Holy Spirit to begin to you know just you'll feel it just churning and then things that were clouded become clearer &gt;&gt; and it will cause you to it'll cause you to think about uh I want you to think about God himself because uh th this is a this is a supernatural gospel and we can't be worshiping God and not know who he is &gt;&gt; uh and we desire a clearer understanding of him when we approach him. We want to be able to know that uh he's accepting us and receiving us. So I'm going to read uh Malachi uh just the first verse. Malachi 1 and 1. Malachi, the last book of the Old Testament. I have two scriptures that may not sound like they go together. The second one will be in Revelation, the first chapter, ninth verse. I'm going to read these first two and then we'll have some some slides. uh one quote in the slides and uh if you just look this way for a moment uh what what the service will do this evening what I pray that it will do is is uh in some of the statements that are being made I want you to listen real close now some of the statements that are being made the statement will be like an ingredient like I said to my wife uh this today I said the service would be like the main body of a a cake mix or something you're going to mix and you get the main body of it there and then you had to add in the salt and add in the butter and add in all the other things that you know the baking powder whatever more and and and then you hope for a success. Well uh I feel that uh you know we we can have uh you can read messages, you can hear them etc etc. you can hear uh uh sermons preached and so on and but it's very essential that we have the main body of ingredients &gt;&gt; and uh and I think that one of one of the things that I've been pondering for a long time a very long time is about God give me an understanding uh give me a give me a some understanding of your being and who you are and and then I go back to the statement brother Brandham has said and it says it a number of times, God the eternal being. And whenever I got that, you know, he fills all time and space. And I just thought, you know, who who who are you? I know you sent Jesus. I understand that. I know he died for me. I've accepted that. But when I come and I say, "God, who is this God? He fills all time and space. I have to bring it down to the lowest denominator and it's there's space between you and I. And we're going to go into the heavens. We're looking to go into the rapture. And and and God fills all time and space. And God is full of his attributes. And so that that that's something to ponder. You might say, "Well, that doesn't matter to me. I just believe what do you believe and who do you believe in?" And these are things that are important. And I find that the prophet, he said some things that indicate very very firmly that he had a contact with God, the eternal God. He could reach out, lay hold of because he knew who it was. He knew who it was. It was mystical. He even talks about it being mystical. It's it's a people thought he was, you know, a fortune teller or this that the other thing because it reached on out into the mystical things. But you have a you have a servant who could speak so simplistically and and have an answer from God. And that's what we want. &gt;&gt; We want we want that supernatural God to reach down and do supernatural things right in your life, in your home, and and you know, a real a real God. Amen. A living God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what we want? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. We'll read in Malachi 1 and1. The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. And I just want you to keep in your heart now the burden of the word of the Lord because we're going to be dealing with that in Revelation 1 and9. I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called Patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. I'm your companion &gt;&gt; in tribulation. I might just say this before we even start. I have it written down. We need to be taught and we need to be taught not how to escape hardships, but how to go through them victoriously. &gt;&gt; People that keep coming to church and they keep thinking the minister's going to preach, I'm going to I'm going to escape this hardship. No, no. I I think it's the wrong approach. And then they say, "Well, that didn't do it. You know, maybe I'm not a believer. Maybe I'm not bride. Maybe the preacher didn't preach the right service or whatever, whatever." And it opens the door. We're We're not here to escape them. And I can prove it by the scripture. We're not here to escape hardships. We're here to go through them victoriously. I am your brother and companion in hardship or in tribulation. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, you may be seated. Keep your Bible if you would. I'm going to read one scripture while you're seated because I'm going then immediately to some uh some slides and Revelation 3 and the first verse. And I read this because the first slide is referring back to it. And unto the angel of the church of in Sardis, write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead. And brother Brandham is referring to I know here in this first quote. So, if we can just uh and I'll read as we go along. Now, the Lord God Almighty says, "I know there he is walking in the midst of his people. There he is, the chief shepherd of the flock, but does he hold back the persecution? Does he stem the tribulation?" No, he does not. He simply says, "I know your tribulation. I am not at all unmindful of your suffering. &gt;&gt; What a what a stumbling block this is to so many people. What a stumbling block this is to so many people. And I trust that it's not a stumbling block to anyone here or that hears the service. What a stumbling block this is uh to the people like like Israel. They wonder if God really loves them. How can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer? This is what they asked in Malachi 1:3. The the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. I have loved you, saith the Lord. Uh 1 to three. All right. I have loved you, sayeth the Lord. Um yet you say, "Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? Sayeth the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob. I and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste. for the dragons of the wilderness. You see, I want to get this other one. You see, they could not figure out God's love. They thought that love meant no suffering. They thought that love meant a a baby with parental care. But God said that his love was elective love. The proof of his love is election. that no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God hath chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. Now, you can just uh uh h have a look at me for a moment. I'm not uh uh uh just that young but in all the years I have never saw the scripture Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated in the term or in the in the format of elective love until I saw it here in the in the message it's you you may think well uh we would think in the human terms oh god decided that one he loved the other one he hated. No, that's not it. He elected to love one. &gt;&gt; He elected to love. You are not just chosen, you know, because of any good thing or any works or anything else. It is the fact that God elected and he has a he has a he has freedom of choice. He has absolute freedom of choice. Do you accept that? you have and like if you don't get that then you think well uh uh you know it's based on something it's it's based on one thing and that is God has election he's free to elect &gt;&gt; Jacob have I loved who's going to question that Jacob have I loved let's let's forget the other one for a moment let's forget Esau Jacob have I loved has he got a right to love one &gt;&gt; has he got a love to Has he got a right to leave one out I'll just leave it like that say, "Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated, and uh because God hath chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the of the truth. He may commit you to death as he did Paul. &gt;&gt; He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative." So, we just simply want to say whatever it is. And I have a phrase, I use it all the time. Uh, I may sound like a broken record, especially to my wife. I said, it is what it is. That's the best way to deal with things. Says, well, you know, the world this and that and all this all this perversion or all something else and everything and people are, you know, laxidasical. It is what it is. I asked brother Brandham once uh you know concerning the will of God and he said well when people come and and ask me about their about the will of God for their life unless he said God gives a vision of course if he gives a vision that's different but he said I I I usually ask them how they have found their life going in the last in the past and he says when they tell me how it's gone in the past I usually say Well, that's probably how it'll go in the future. That's very very wise. I heard an account of uh uh I don't I don't know just exactly how it went, but there was a a man had a little store in a community in a farming community and it was a whole valley and people would be moving in and moving out whatever. But but people it was new area and people were moving in and so uh this one family was moving in and the fellow stopped this little weed general store. didn't didn't have a town, just a store by the road. And he said, "Uh, you know, we're we're moving in from a certain state and we like to know how are the people in this valley." He said, "Well, how did you find the people where you come from?" He said, this one fell said, "Ah." He said, "They're just a bunch of," he said, "they're just a bunch of thieves there." He said, "It was terrible." He said, "I had to get out of there." He said, 'Well, I you'll probably find the people here about the same. And the next people that came in, they asked him the same question. How are the people in this valley? And he said, "Well, how did you find the people where you come from?" Oh, he said, "It was just wonderful. We we were just like one great big family." He said, "Uh, people helped one another and they would work for one another and he said they would, you know, lend their equipment or whatever." He said, "They were just wonderful." He said, "We had a hard time leaving." He said, 'I I I imagine you'll find the people here about the same. And I think uh now now I now I had a prophet saying, "Well, how how do you how do you find things in the past?" And they're asking about the perfect will of God. It isn't that God didn't have a perfect will for their lives, but it is whether we as individuals submit to it and go to it. And you can't submit to the perfect will of God. Read this quote and be trying to escape all the hardship. &gt;&gt; Thus says the Lord, you're not going to do it. Um All right. That is his prerogative. He is sovereign. That we're in the third line. He is sovereign but it is all with a purpose. I want you to notice that if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace. His purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as Job said he put strength in us. Job 23 and6 you you see he himself suffered. He learned obedience by the things that he suffered. He was actually made perfect by the things uh that he suffered. Though he were a son, yet learned his obedience by the things which he suffered in Hebrews 5:8-9. And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. In plain language, the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. And according to Paul, he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection. Why did he want this? My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations, knowing this, that the trying of your faith workketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that quote? And I know that you will. Now I wanted I wanted just to say that to read that as a as a means of you you might draw back from uh some some thought and the reason I'm just being very very careful at the beginning because I want if you miss the beginning you actually miss the whole service. Uh and here's the direction I'm going to go the Lord willing. And I've really really waited on God for this because I wanted it clear in my own mind. I go back to the beginning and number one, the word coming forth from the bosom of the father to be the lamb of God. Uh how many recall he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world? How do you have even that thought, whatever it means to us? How do you even have that picture without there being a burden for the word of the Lord? It might be a burden of purpose. It might be a burden of of redemption, but it was a determination in God's mind, and you were there. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a fall. Satan's going to uh come and and and try and destroy the creation and I'm going to redeem it &gt;&gt; and I'm going to redeem every person. I'm going to redeem every son. I've already elected them. I've already chosen them. I've already predestinated them. This will be part of my family and I will have them with me. So there had to be a a burden of the word of the Lord from the very very very inception &gt;&gt; of things. Number two, the burden of the word of the Lord in the Old Testament in types and shadows. Number three, the burden of the word of the Lord in Jesus, the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; We're going to take some real quick turns here in just a moment. Number four, the burden of the word of the Lord throughout the New Testament church. And number five, the burden of the word of the Lord in this last age in the revealing of the son of man. And I can show you clearly in the scripture and did so last Sunday. The more he was revealed, the more burden there was and the more misunderstanding there was. But the more burden there was to carry that revealing and to live that revealing because friends, this this is Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; You understand that? This is Satan's Eden. It's not going to become simpler or it's not going to become easier. It's going to be more difficult all the time. simply living that life in uh in uh in the state the world is in. &gt;&gt; Now, we need to be taught, as I said a few moments ago, not how to escape the hardship or pressures and rigors of a believer's life, but rather how to go through them victoriously. This can only be done when one has the correct view of their life in relationship to God and his purpose. When I see the majesty and the magnificence of God who rolls, as the prophet says, rolls the stars off his fingers. And and and we're worried about life. &gt;&gt; We're worried about, you know, how we're going to make it. I said and and and one of the statements that brother Brandham says and I don't want to just leave everything on him. I want to bring it to you. But one of the statements that he makes is he says, "Oh, you brothers that are in the message a lot of time." He says, "Oh, when I when I think of these things, when I see that, he said, denominations just fade away." You &gt;&gt; remember what he said that &gt;&gt; denominations he just got so caught in the in the truth of the word and how God is dealing and when when people denominated they died but when he talks about it he says when I talk about this when I when I see this he said denominations just fade away. Those are huge great organizations but he just seen them fade away. If you see the substance of the service tonight, it will really help you to see that your life in relationship to the great eternal God that fills all time and space and he decided, he determined to elect you to redemption. If you don't believe that election, then there's no purpose being here. &gt;&gt; But if you believe in election, then we might as well believe it all the way and be fanatical about it. I believe that God, God, who is God? Who is God? And Brother Brown talks about that. I think we'll probably I'll quote it. Who is God? This great eternal one who had no beginning and no end. This God that flung the galaxies out and the stars and the planets and gave them names. This God. &gt;&gt; This God, as as one colored brother said, this God who makes a lemon sour and a peach sweet. This God who puts the dew drops on the lily leaf and it quivers in the sunlight. This God that raises Christ from the dead. This God that will NOT SEE NOT ONE of his children pulled out of his hand. &gt;&gt; This God. And then h unless we have a view of this God, then what is our sickness or what is our infirmity in the in the view of that God or what is our problem or what is our financial difficulties in the view of that God? What is anything that we're concerned about in comparison or in relationship to that God? Everything must be in relationship to that God. What is my life in relationship to that God? That's what's important. &gt;&gt; Our span of life here is but a fleeting moment in relationship to eternal life. In fact is you can't relate it to eternal life because we've had a beginning and we've had an end as far as mortal life is concerned. But in the immortal season the prophet said you've had eternal life. If you have eternal life, I will be reading it. Then you always had that life and and uh you had that life in God's mind because he is eternal. He's going to have children that are like him. And enough said on that subject. He said, "Let's just take back and find out uh just a minute who God is. Let's look back at the beginning of time." This is a little picture I want to draw. So you can get some conception of who this being is &gt;&gt; in our midst tonight. &gt;&gt; You see what he's saying? He said he wanted the people to get some concept, some conception of who this being is that's in the meeting. &gt;&gt; And I went quickly to the end of the service and he displayed and manifested, not brother Brandham, but God did through that vessel. displayed and manifested who he was to get the attention of the people and to let them know I am God. It's like he's screaming, "I'm God and I'm here and DON'T DON'T BE BLIND. DON'T BE TOO DULL. See me and and I'm speaking to you and I'm drawing you and yes, THAT'S MY SPIRIT. THAT'S WHAT IT'S NOT JUST SOME FEELING THAT you have." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe if we come to the place where we GIVE OUR FATHER THE recognition that he should have. We you'll receive a lot more from him. &gt;&gt; He says, I want to uh this this is a little picture I want to draw so you can get some conception of who is who this being is in our midst tonight that's moving amongst us. Friends, I didn't choose these at random. This is something that has spoken to my own heart &gt;&gt; and that's why I'm bringing it to you. He said, "If you could only realize who that is." I'm taking his words and bringing it to this service tonight. If you could only realize who that is, healing would be a secondary or a minor thing to you. If you're sick or afflicted, healing is not a minor thing to you, but it should be in relationship to who this God is. the physical thing, the mortal thing should just become a very uh a very small and irrelevant thing in sight of God &gt;&gt; in the view of God. &gt;&gt; M maybe we you don't think about him enough. We need to think about him. Who is this God? Who's who's speaking this now through a prophet? You mean it takes time with the spirit of Elijah to say if you only could realize who's here tonight? Healing would be a secondary or a minor thing to you if you could just see who he is. &gt;&gt; In the continuing in the same message, who is God? Let us see coming out of space where there's nothing. Let's make a little white light like a mystic light halo. And that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning. That was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father. That was what was in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. In the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of God. And he said, "Let us notice." He said, "I have to make this before going back into it just uh just like a little picture drama here for you in a a moment in order to get one point to you. Who what is in our midst tonight? &gt;&gt; That was the whole point. &gt;&gt; I have to get this drama. I have to get in in in the beginning. If anybody has the authority to go back to the beginning, it would be a prophet of God. And one that was here, one that you can hear the voice of, if you wish, on tape, one that you can read a message book if you have the interest to pick it up and to read it and to ponder that this God sent this kind of a servant to get the people. If you could only believe and realize who is in the midst of you. Not somebody way off into space somewhere. Not somebody in some other part of the world, but the God who by elective love has chosen the certain people. And if we're not it, he he just says plainly, if we weren't in the mind of God with eternal life, then we haven't got it. But if we did have and he's called you to if he's called you to eternal life and you know it was the spirit of God, YOU CAN GO BACK AND SAY, "GOD SPOKE TO ME. &gt;&gt; GOD called me." That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's what you have to do. GO BACK TO THAT. GO BACK TO BETHL. GO BACK TO THAT PLACE THAT GOD CALLED YOU. Say that God called me. Who is God? the eternal being filling all time and space is here in the service. It could be in the simplest service, could be in the home, could be in the prayer time, in your own. But God, I can tell you friends, I did something I've never done before uh in in Switzerland last time I played the service here when brother Ron Spencer preached, but I needed I had a I had a very very great great burdening burdensome questions and burdensome problems and things that I was dealing with. Not for a day, not for a week, not for a month, but maybe two or three years. nothing, nothing of a physical nature, nothing within my family. It was just something that I was uh burdened over and I was very very burdened and I I I just held it before God. I didn't hardly speak to anybody about it. But then brother Ron Spencer spoke and I I played the service here on a Wednesday night and I can't I can't tell you exactly because these are eternal things and they're not they're not made for the English or any other language but it was just within my own soul and bosom and I'd pondered these things. It was like God had been talking to me and preparing me and he was saying, you know, I was getting the not like a voice but like a a distinct impression. Don't take your counsel from others or even professional people or don't take your counsel. And it was like God was saying to me very tenderly, I've led you all these years. I've led you since you're a young man, I led you. I've led your family. And I'm I'm agreeing with it. Yes, you have. You have. You don't even And I was saying, now I'm getting very personal. I was saying, Lord, you didn't give me any sons. You gave me three wonderful daughters, but I don't have sons. And I I've I've thought about that. And I thought, well, you you've given me three wonderful daughters, but I don't have sons. And he he was saying like I I I'm I'm your father. I've led you. I've I've provided. I've watched over. And I could see where he watched over and did things when I didn't have any knowledge of it. And the service ended and it was such a powerful service. I was sitting literally on the edge of my seat. I was transfixed. And uh when the service ended, a couple people came up over here and they asked brother Tom, brother brother Ron Spencer to go and and he he prayed with these but he was so worn out and he was just like staggering and so they helped him off the platform and I was sitting down in here and and I just I just vacated my wife and Linda was there and they were sitting with some others and the place was packed and I ran up the aisle. This is this is who you call pastor. I ran up the aisle. I ran across because they were already whisking them out and they were halfway down the building that side just getting ready to go out the double doors when I caught them. And I said, "Brother Ron, Brother Ron, I thought, you know, the woman at the well had her moment. This was mine. &gt;&gt; I'd never done this in my life." &gt;&gt; And I called him. I said, "Brother Ron, I I I just want you in that atmosphere." It wasn't It wasn't Brother Ron Spencer. It was the It was the God that was in the midst. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying, brothers? I was coming to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I looked beyond the vessel. I didn't even have that in my mind. But I wanted him. I want you to pray for my family. I want you to pray for me. He said, "Sure, brother Ed." And he just weaving around, but it was my faith who I was going to touch &gt;&gt; and who I had already made contact with. And I waved to my wife and she came out and and Linda came with her and we we just were in a huddle there and quite a few people around because the service was essentially ending, but people weren't leaving. And brother Ron just began to pray. Now I'll just tell you friends within 90 days within 90 days all the questions and all the problems and everything vanished &gt;&gt; and I didn't have to do a thing. God just came down and worked things this way, that way, brought people in, did whatever. It's just like I sat back and it was a kneejerk. I and my wife, we've been stunned for several weeks. &gt;&gt; You're quiet. &gt;&gt; That's the God I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; That's the God who's our counselor. &gt;&gt; That's the God who's wonderful. &gt;&gt; That's the God who's living God. &gt;&gt; That's the God who gave you life, &gt;&gt; gave you eternal life. &gt;&gt; And if people could only realize who is in our midst, Every service would be vastly different. Wouldn't matter who's behind the pullpit, BUT PEOPLE WOULD MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT GOD. And that God WOULD WORK IN YOUR LIFE LONG AFTER YOU WENT OUT THESE DOORS. THAT'S THE GOD HE'S WAITING TO DO. THAT FRIENDS, I want you to believe that tonight. TAKE THIS INSTRUCTION. THAT GOD, &gt;&gt; HE CAN TAKE THE IMPOSSIBLE AND TURN it around. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE HE'S THE ONE. HE COULD CREATE ANOTHER GALAXY OR ANOTHER MILLION GALAXIES IF HE WANTED TO. BUT HE WANTS TO BE YOUR FATHER. HE WANTS TO DEMONSTRATE I AM THE FATHER. And like Jesus Jesus when he was asked how we how we should pray said our father. &gt;&gt; First word which art in heaven. Jesus was manifested now the burden of the word of the Lord. I'm going way back beyond my understanding. I won't even attempt to. But somewhere, I don't even know exactly how, but somehow I cannot think of a lamb of God that was bleeding before the foundation of the world without believing that somewhere somehow there was a a burden or a determination that the redemption the redemption project is a finished work. And even though there must be maybe much suffering and much carrying of the word in its different phases, it shall all come to pass. And I will find the faithful people. I WILL FIND THE faithful men. I will find the faithful women. And I'll lay it upon their heart. And they SHALL BE TRUE IN EVERY AGE. &gt;&gt; Can the people say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. So Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament. All who were part of the shadows and types carried the burden of the word. Even in the shadows and the types and Christ is revealed in his own word. He he says he was alive in the Old Testament manifested. I just want to let you see a little something here if you can stand it. Watch. when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament as we believe it. Now you preachers out there, you can argue with it. Do whatever you want to, but I'm talking to my he said what I what I think. See, and when he was manifest in the Old Testament in a theophony in the person of Melzdc, don't get lost in the terminology, but he was manifested. That's the key. He was manifested. And I have to I have to emphasize that he said he was manifested in a theophony in the person of Melzdc. Not a priesthood which be would be a group of people but the person the man for he said this man had not yet been born. &gt;&gt; Jesus hadn't been born. So it's not the burden of the word of the Lord that Jesus carried. It's a burden of the word of the Lord that was carried in the Old Testament. But it was Christ in Noah. &gt;&gt; And he preached for 120 years with very little success. And that's where a prophet preached on just few, very few. Only eight souls came into the ark. But that was a burden of the word of the Lord. Listen friends, we can just, you know, let it roll off of our lips, but it it's not that simple to think that a man got up every day for 120 years and preached that there's going to be rain from heaven and the scientists de declared something opposite and all the intellectuals declared something opposite. There's never been rain. It only comes by due and and science proves there's no water up there. Nevertheless, this man carried the burden of the word of the Lord. And the word of the Lord was it's going to rain and there's going to be a flood. &gt;&gt; And he believed it to the point of getting his own family locked up inside. And there was no rain, but he still believed that word. And suddenly the earth opened up and the waters gushed out of the earth and waters came from heaven and there was a flood according to the word of the Lord. But Noah carried the burden. And as it was in the days of Noah, when they planted and they build it, are you listening to me? Even so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed. And who's carrying that? Hello, here we are. Say, I carry that. I will declare the truth. I will live it by God's grace. I will declare that the that we had this kind of a message and this kind of a messenger in this perverted generation. &gt;&gt; Are you getting a little bit of where I'm going? &gt;&gt; As it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Abraham, it wasn't easy to say, "Everywhere you put the your sole of your foot, I give you that land." And he just started walking and he believed God. And he didn't he he he he's getting the land, but where's the son? Who's going to inherit this land? Eleazar, his servant, who's gonna who's going to be heir? He says to God, "WHO'S MY HEIR? WHO'S GOING TO HAVE ALL of this?" &gt;&gt; It was a small thing to God. He let He He He allowed Sarah to become old and dried up. And he allowed uh Abraham to become old because what is it to God to reverse the cells and turn them back to youth again and to make them active and to cause a birth? Remember Isaac was I Isaac was born. Hallelujah. He was a son that was given because he was the type. He was a shadow. So even producing the shadow, there was a burden of the word of the Lord to produce a shadow &gt;&gt; TO PRODUCE A TYPE. THEY WEREN'T EVEN LIVING FOR THE real thing. They were ONLY GIVING A SHADOW, A NEGATIVE OF THE POSITIVE. &gt;&gt; I don't know whether it means anything to you, but it means a whole lot to me. &gt;&gt; They live just to be a shadow &gt;&gt; of something that was coming. And then finally would come a day I have to keep just referring to it so you'll catch THE CONNECTION. FINALLY THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN IT'S NOT A SHADOW ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; But the reality is how &gt;&gt; God has not called us to live a shadow. He's called us to look back. See there it was in the time of the shadow and there it was in the time of Christ and there it was in the early church. And here you've had it all the way up. And now you should have you SHOULD BE EMPOWERED. YOU SHOULD be you should have a heart of faith. Say he he was loyal there. He was loyal there. He did it there. HE USED OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS AND SEERS and sages and he used THEM ALL THE WAY DOWN THROUGH HISTORY AND HE WILL not fail. &gt;&gt; Great is his faithfulness. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I won't apologize over being over being uh captured by this because I've been pondering it for days and days. And so this man was not born was not yet had not been born. But he was in the theophony. So he had no father, no mother. He was God himself. &gt;&gt; He was manifested. Manifest means to appear. He appeared. He made himself real. Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Lift your hands up if you're &gt;&gt; all right. Fine. So, he had no father. And that's why uh Melzdc had no father, no mother, no beginning of days, but he was called king of Salem and king of peace, king of righteousness because it was a shadow. God was laying down a shadow. Now I I want you to get another principle please for the another ingredient for this important mix. God would cause in the time of the time of the types and shadows. He would cause people to have a burden to have a certain burden for righteousness and they would live their lives live their lives and those lives would be scribed and the events would be scribed by scribes and God watched over that it would come into a book called the Bible because there would be a people that would have to go back to this word. So they were living out the word but there was no word for them to know that they were living out the word. &gt;&gt; God God of election who had called them and predestinated them and was guiding them. It goes to show you that we can be guided as they were guided. &gt;&gt; They were guided without a book. &gt;&gt; They were guided without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They were guided in such a way that they just lived their lives. Was it a life of ease? No, &gt;&gt; THEY HAD MANY TRIALS, MANY TRIBULATIONS, but they just plowed along. &gt;&gt; They just continued to move and plow along day after day. Did some of them go to school, fellas? I suppose they did. I don't know if they had anything like universities, but whatever they did. And Moses, he had to be educated in all. He was he he became so wise he could teach the Egyptians. And yet God stripped him down. Why? Because he was carrying a burden of the word of the Lord. There must be a deliverer for the children of Israel. And he and why did he have that burden? And the prophet said he looked out the same window that Pharaoh looked out. And Pharaoh saw them as his slaves to build cities. And Moses saw them as God's people. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach, friends. And you got to deal with it. &gt;&gt; Moses, this Moses elected of God, went out and killed a man. &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't want A MAN BEHIND THE PULPIT THAT HAD murdered a man. BUT HE WAS SO DRIVEN &gt;&gt; that these people, HE WAS SO DRIVEN BY THE BURDEN OF THE word of THE LORD. THESE PEOPLE MUST BE FREE. YOU MIGHT BE SAYING, "ARE YOU SAYING, WELL, THAT CAUSED HIM TO KILL A MAN?" WELL, he did it. He saw two striving and he he smoked the Egyptian and buried them in the sand and tried to hide from the the one thing about the Bible that's so wonderful. It tells the good and the bad. &gt;&gt; AND GOD'S NOT AFRAID of the good or the bad. He's not afraid of either one because he has a injection for the bad. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you will not find Moses as a murderer in the New Testament. You will not find Abraham lying in the New Testament. You will not find Rahab as a harlot in the New Testament. In fact, you'll find her the mother of Jesus Christ, one of them. You talk about an antidote. And then Satan tries to come and bombast you with his uh with your mistakes and your errors and your weaknesses. YOU TELL HIM TO GO BACK WHERE HE CAME FROM. &gt;&gt; He has no right to the ELECT OF GOD. HE HAS NO RIGHT TO THE blood wash. If we could ONLY GET A CONGREGATION OF people that would REFUSE SATAN AND ACCEPT GOD. &gt;&gt; I RECOGNIZE WHO'S HERE IN THIS MIDST AND SATAN HAS NO RIGHT IN THIS PLACE. Then I tell you, YOU'D HAVE A PLACE WHERE SUPERNATURAL is taking place. People being healed. That's one of the minor things in their but what what's more important is their growth and the stability and the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ in Noah, Christ in Abraham. These two lived uh and bore the weight of the burden of the word of the Lord to leave a record of types and shadows. &gt;&gt; I just hold that MelzDC foreshadowed Jesus Christ as priest and king of the most high in a theophony form. Jesus Christ had not been born yet. Now we move to another phase when the word became flesh to suffer for sin so that he might suffer and die the death for our sins and for the sins of the world redeeming all back to God. You might say, well, how does this relate to us? If he hadn't bore our sins, we wouldn't be here. If you had not bore the weight of our sins, we would have no purpose in life. &gt;&gt; We'd be left in darkness. &gt;&gt; You'd be left in utter frustration and confusion. I THANK GOD THAT HE SENT Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; as my redeemer, your redeemer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us, and I'm just touching highlights now. The scripture tells us, "And he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed, saying, Oh father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt." &gt;&gt; You don't think there was a burden? Of course, there was. Huge burden. The burden of misunderstanding. the burden of the cares, the burden of his compassion, and the burden of the word for utterance. &gt;&gt; You carry that. &gt;&gt; There's times when you need to utter things that are in harmony with the word of God. You need to say it. &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to give your testimony. You have to give your own testimony. You have to make your own confession. &gt;&gt; God's not going to come down and and and speak it for you. &gt;&gt; You have to give your testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a burden of utterance. We have a burden of responsibility. We are responsible people. Responsible more than all the people of the earth. You say, "Well, I have my friends and my peers and whatever more and I go to I go to school or university or college or whatever more or I go with I'm a believer like like any other believer." That isn't what he's asking for. He's asking for you to be a believer as he tells you to be a believer. He tells you to be be you be the one that gives a witness of it. It it doesn't mean that we are on the street all the time or but in in life in life we give witness to what our conviction is. &gt;&gt; And now I just to get my point across after Jesus had risen from the dead. He walked with Cleopus and his friend speaking to them from the burden of the word of the Lord in the types and the shadows. He has no Bible, but they have the Old Testament, the Torah, and he has the types and the shadows. And so Jesus is is going walking with Calopus and his friend and saying, "Oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken." And beginning at Moses, beginning at Moses, he begins to declare and speak in all the scriptures of the things concerning himself. He's saying, are you listening? You are. He's saying, don't you know who's walking with you? Don't you know who's here now? &gt;&gt; Don't you know who's present? Don't you know who's resurrected? Here's what Moses said. Here's what here all the scriptures. Here's what they all said. And he speaks of himself. The word taking the word in shadow form and telling them it's fulfilled. Here it here it is. Here I am. I'm I'm alive. I'm rightly I'm right here with you. And uh I I spoke a whole message on this. And the Bible says, and you can read it in Luke 24. The Bible says, "And Jesus himself, drew near and went with them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never forget that &gt;&gt; Jesus himself, and I'm absolute confident, is in this Wednesday night service. That's right. and he's drawing near to somebody, &gt;&gt; maybe drawing near to this congregation, and he's going to go with you &gt;&gt; as an individual. I don't know where you're going to go, but he knows. &gt;&gt; And he's going to go with you. &gt;&gt; Just hold that. Then Jesus got word. And listen friends, who's he working for? For us. I'm going to explain it to you. Listen very close. This scripture had to be scribed. Somebody had to scribe it. So he heard that Lazarus, his friend, was sick. very sick. And Mary and Martha had called for him. And the Bible says he loved Mary and Martha and Lazarus. And when he heard he was very sick and brother Brandham, you want to hear if you if you got if you got a the folio views from Voice of God, you can go and search it out. And he talks about Mary and Martha and and Lazarus and how Jesus was such a good friend of his of them. And he so he hears that he's sick. What's he do? He goes he waits two days and then he goes into Galilee with his disciples. He's going opposite direction. Says who who is this Christ? Who is this person? Who is this God? Doesn't even come when I call him. Who is this pastor? Who is this person? Who is this believer? Doesn't even come when I call him. and Lazarus died. It had to be written &gt;&gt; that way. &gt;&gt; He was living out the written word of God before it was written &gt;&gt; because we had to read the written word and see what he did. So that was the burden of the word. Do you think that he didn't have compassion? You're so quiet. And I'm glad you are because this has to reach down into the very depths of your soul to have a transforming power to it. Jesus, he had compassion. He knew that Mary and Martha are burdened, terribly worried about Lazarus, a friend of Jesus. He's not coming. He's not coming. And now we hear that he's gone into Galilee. And the disciples even said, "Why are you going into Galilee? They tried to stone you the last time." He's doing the opposite to what a normal mind would say. And we've got to get out of our normal way of thinking. That doesn't have anything to do with the eternal PLAN OF GOD. THY WILL BE DONE, oh God. &gt;&gt; Whatever that might be. &gt;&gt; And you have to believe that God is in the midst. &gt;&gt; I I look across this congregation. We're all at different levels and in tears in life and some are students and some are newly married and some are mothers and fathers and some are on down the road. We all got a a different package. But we all are called to one thing to bear the burden of the word of the Lord to bear the testimony of Jesus Christ. And he's been revealed as the son of man. &gt;&gt; I know that that didn't get to you just exactly the way I want to. I gave you a quote the other day and the prophet of God is going way back into the beginning and he's saying he's saying that uh God you know he had attributes he was alone I'm giving different parts and pieces he was alone he was lonely even said he was alone and he thought saw himself as being a father he saw himself as having a family this was this was his attributes he saw himself as being the savior, but there was nothing lost. He saw himself as being a healer, BUT THERE WAS nothing sick. HE SAW HIMSELF AS BEING ALL OF THESE THINGS, but first and foremost, he wanted to be a father in order to be a father. And the prophet said, and I love this, where he said he loved fatherhood. I never want you to forget that phrase came out of the prophet's mouth from God himself. God is speaking it. He loved fatherhood. And the only only capital O the only way that he could express that is to become a son of man. So he became a son so he could express a father. &gt;&gt; Oh I'm going to read some things out of the scripture to you. JESUS TALKING TO HIS FATHER. Father glorify thou me with the glory I had with thee before the world was. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I JUST ABOUT WENT BALLISTIC when I read that again today. I'VE SEEN IT SO MANY TIMES, READ IT SO MANY TIMES, BUT IT TOOK THE PROPHET'S message to to give it its full embodiment said, "OH, THE PRAYER THAT HE PRAYED," and it it's only in the prayer that he prayed uh that's recorded by by John the Apostle, who also was in the aisle called Patmas, &gt;&gt; who said, "Your companion in the tribulation, &gt;&gt; not the great tribulation, your companion in the burdens of life, your companion. It wasn't easy, but he ra he had to write it and scribe it and he had to live the two years there in Iowa Patmas so we would have the word of God. &gt;&gt; I feel I'm getting the point across. And so Jesus, he he terried these days about several days and then he comes he comes and says, "Where have you laid him? They said, "Come and see." And they brought him. And then they have the shortest verse in the Bible. Jesus wept. And they were all weeping. Jesus knew they were weeping. Jesus knew they were mourning. &gt;&gt; Two two young ladies that he cared so much for and that ministered to him, Mary and Martha. What faithful women they were. and said Martha saying and even now I know whatever you ask the father he will give it to you &gt;&gt; that kind of devoted love but he had her wait that had to be played out friends for you and I &gt;&gt; I almost feel like we're spoiled kids &gt;&gt; GOD PUT PEOPLE THROUGH SO MUCH &gt;&gt; to write this WORD OF GOD FOR US THAT CARRIED SUCH A BURDEN for us surely we can carry a burden of the word of the Lord in this hour. &gt;&gt; OH, I SAY GOD, LAY IT ON US. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE A BUNCH A BUNCH OF WHIMPERING CHILDREN. WE'RE GOING TO BE MEN AND WOMEN THAT STAND UP AND SAY, "GIVE US A LOAD." &gt;&gt; Only we're NOT GOING TO BEND UNDER THE WEIGHT of the load of the revealing of the SON OF MAN. WHAT AN HONOR. WHAT A PRIVILEGE, LORD JESUS. WHAT A PRIVILEGE THIS IS TO BE ABLE to carry the load of the revealing of your son Jesus Christ. AND THAT WAS ONE OF YOUR GREAT ATTRIBUTES. YOU SO LOVE fatherhood that you HAD TO BECOME A SON OF man to show us what kind of person this is. &gt;&gt; So Jesus speaks of him of himself through the Old Testament types I gave you. And beginning at Moses and all of the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. That was the only way God could express himself as a father. Few more minutes, please. And Jesus answered them in John the 12th chapter. and saying, "The hour has come." See, he's he's he's progressing with life. The hour hadn't always come, but now the hour had come. I'm going to come to the bullseye just now. The hour has come. He's just getting ready for Calvary. The hour's come that the Son of Man should be glorified. I'm saying the You think he didn't know that the people were going to leave him by the thousands? He knew they were going to leave him. The hour has come where the Son of Man shall be glorified with spit all over his beard and his beard pulled out and a crown of thorns on his head and all of these things and gasp his last breath and die and hang his head into thy into thy hands do I commit my soul spirit. The hour has come. And Jesus had said just just prior to this, I'm the bread that came down from heaven. And that was too heavy for them to pick up and bear. And the Bible says that they were people were offended. And that's scandalized in the Greek. It's a scandal. They said and and the prophet of God says in this day he says they say is he some kind does he want us to be vampires you eat my flesh and drink my blood and they could go right back to the scripture and say it's written that is an abomination to God &gt;&gt; where would we be &gt;&gt; listen friends I'm talking very very serious where would we as a congregation be that's why we don't care what people pay or what people have to they're their their AUTHORITY IS SO MINUTE COMPARED TO A PROPHET OF God who says if if I'm a false prophet put it across my back if that doesn't happen exactly that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall I read it for you? &gt;&gt; Okay. I challenge and anybody who's listening out on the internet or wherever this might go, I challenge them. I challenge you to come and and do one up on this. Just I'm going to read just one and let them have to come with a reality that's greater than this. And if they don't, let their mouths be silent forever. &gt;&gt; And let it be out of your mind forever. &gt;&gt; I don't even pay an ounce of attention to it. It is what it is. &gt;&gt; They'll have to answer for whatever conclusions they come to or however. To me, I see this as the beloved son of God, &gt;&gt; carrying the weight of the world, carrying my sins, making a way and living out the word before it was even written so that the scribes could scribe it so that we would have a Bible and then see it fulfilled, fulfilled, fulfilled, and coming TO THE LAST DAY. AND THEN I WILL SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET before the great and terrible day of the Lord. And we have such record as we have here. I hold in my hand a man comes. He says, "Yes, sir, brother. You have trouble with arthritis." I want you to be very careful. Watch how he starts. Just a physical form, physical thing. You have trouble with arthritis is what bothers you. Isn't that right? Now, I just want to say before, and you'll have to understand me as a human. I read it to these brothers also. If this man came into this congregation wanting prayer, I would have to have a direct word from God to have anything to do with him. Now you will listen. And brother Brandham has to say, "Look, I want you to look this way." And he just and be just as sincere as you can. Life hasn't been a flower bed of ease for you, has it, brother? Had lots of sorrow, lots of trouble. You're in trouble right now, brother. Isn't that right? Now, he's standing in public. He sang it to the world. He sang it to us and we were re we're reading it tonight. He said, "You're in trouble right now, brother. Isn't that right? At one time, you wouldn't have come here in this prayer line. You was an unbeliever once, very much critical of religion. Isn't that right? You done a great thing along that time, too. Something that hurt you. I believe you you rebuked God or cursed with God or something or done something wrong or didn't you do that? How would you think brother by the spirit of God? Is that a tract concerning He talking about attract is that a track concerning it? All right. Now he says, "Now concerning that," talking about the tract, a little tract, he said, "Now concerning that, it harmed you." Now being that you had that on tracks, that he had cursed God, rebuked God, and had cursed God. You had that on tracks. He said, "Then look this away. Believe with all your heart. You dearly paid for that, brother. You have lots of troubles now." Nervous. You have a lot of home troubles, too, don't you? Domestic troubles with your own home. Is that right? Will you believe me as God's servant? It's all right for me to speak what the Lord says. &gt;&gt; You've had other troubles too, don't you? Sexual troubles. Is that right? Sexual troubles. You listen that what I mean. Nobody but God alone knows that better than you. Is that right? You believe with all your heart. Now, brother, let me have your hand. Here's the prayer. He asked the people. Let's bow our heads. Our heavenly father, there's nothing but what you know all about it. I'm so thankful that you're here tonight. Blessing this poor old brother, having run and slept away to get out to service, but loves you in his heart. God, make a way for him. Grant it, Lord. He's in trouble. You said that you would be near those who were in need. God, bless my brother now as I bless him in thy name. May all these troubles clear up like a cloud leaving from before the sun. And may he be healed tonight of his arthus and all these other troubles, Lord, and may and and be made new and whole again in the name of Jesus Christ, the son of God, I ask it. Amen. And then he says, he takes more time with this man than he does with maybe three or four other people. He says, "Look here, brother. Let me see you. You feel that you're healed, don't you? You are healed, my brother. God bless you. And go on your way rejoicing and all your troubles are going to clear up now and be all right. God bless you." Then he says, "Can I have this?" Thank you. And it's attract. He says, "God who I stand before now and God attract here." And the title of it is in quotation mark, "Is there a God? I cursed him." And here's a God &gt;&gt; in a man &gt;&gt; carrying the burden of the word &gt;&gt; to a man that most people wouldn't have in their church. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he he's you talk about a prophet, friends, &gt;&gt; seeing way beyond to the man's heart and to see his sincerity and to see his need and to brush everything aside and starts out by telling him about arthritis and ends his prayer with his arthritis because that was the least important thing. &gt;&gt; He said, "Can I have this?" He says, "And God who I stand before now and got attracted here, is there a God? I cursed him." If God in heaven who I stand before knows I know nothing about that tract or anything about it and bring and being it was that I thought maybe when they seen the tract uh the Lord permitted to go right down into the depths of his heart and get something that's really a secret to tell. Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. You believe that Jesus that Jesus is still is is present right here. He can't change. &gt;&gt; That's his attributes. That is him. &gt;&gt; THIS SAME PROPHET WHO SAID THOSE THINGS HAS SAID TO us and you know God would reveal even more &gt;&gt; and say even more. But even in this day and age, you know, we are almost we are we are educated. We are trained. We are built up that we all have rights and and there maybe be very few people that would stand on the platform and allow a man by the name of William Brandham to reveal what he revealed about that man's deep inner being because we are we're educated to the place that we we in our society where we have a right to hold these things. I'll tell you what, God has a right to expose it. God has a right to reveal these things. God has a right to speak it. And he says, "And I have a right to say it." And he says it and the MAN IS DELIVERED. WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT? TO HOLD THE SECRET and be bound or to have it released AND HAVE GOD EXPOSE IT AND SAY, "I'M FREE." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. ONCE I WAS A SINNER. I'M FREE. &gt;&gt; ONCE I WAS SICK, BUT I'M HEALED. PEOPLE TODAY DON'T EVEN WANT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR SICKNESS or anything else, you know, because they want to be PRIVATE ABOUT IT. I SAY GET IT OUT. &gt;&gt; LET GOD REVEAL IT. LET GOD WHATEVER WHATEVER IT TAKES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And then I'm going to close with this even though I'm not quite done, but I'm going to close anyhow. I'm going to close. Jesus had said, "Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Those who eate eatth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life, and I will raise him up." Doesn't say that he got eternal life. Then he says, "He that does that has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day." And he said, "Therefore said I unto you, no man can come." That had to be spoken. He wasn't reading from a quote. He was just saying it because it had to become a quote. &gt;&gt; It had to become a scripture so that you could read it and you COULD BELIEVE IT. AND BY BELIEVING IT, YOU COULD BECOME THE RECIPIENT OF THAT SAME living Christ. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, friends? ISN'T IT ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL? GOD'S PROGRAM THAT GOD KNEW THAT WHEN THAT LITTLE MYSTIC LIGHT CAME OUT from the bosom and the prophet said it was the son of God. &gt;&gt; And from that time, think of it. And from that time, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. You might say, "Well, you read that before." Yes, I did. It needs to be read again. And the load was too heavy for them when he said when he said those things except you eat my flesh and drink my blood. But he says that to the woman at the well. Uh if you knew who it was that was speaking to you, you'd ask me for a drink and I'd give you a drink of a everlasting water. You wouldn't have to come here and and and and be thirsty again. And brother Brandham, he in the first seal. No, please. I'm rushing, but don't don't don't don't let this escape you. In John the 12th chapter, he's reading John 12 and 23. Now, he said, "Listen here now, real close." So, I'm calling on you to listen now, real close. He is then you won't have to wonder no more what it is. And Jesus answering them, saying, "The hour is come that the son of man, son of man," who's the result of the consequence of the attribute of God that was crying out of the eternal being for a release. &gt;&gt; It's a son of man to be glorified. He's going to conquer the deceiver of heaven. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO CONQUER LUCIFER. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING to re He's going to annihilate the the corruption and death &gt;&gt; BY EVEN HIS OWN BODY WILL NOT CORRUPT &gt;&gt; AND TO FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE. THERE WON'T BE A BONE OF HIS BROKEN. &gt;&gt; Can you say glory to God? &gt;&gt; I WANT THIS CONGREGATION TO GIVE HIM PRAISE AND magnify him. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a savior. Amen. &gt;&gt; NO WONDER THEY WROTE THE SONG. OH, WHAT a savior. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "The hour has come that the son of man should be glorified." He said, "See, you're at the end of of an age there. His ministry is ending." And the and the son of man, a son of man, revealing the son of man is coming now to the end of his age &gt;&gt; and the end of his ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, "What about the hour that has come that when his bride must be taken away?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What the hour has come that time shall be no more. &gt;&gt; And the angel is ready to set one foot on land and the other on the sea. That's the people. and with a rainbow, which is his promise, the covenant. God said, "I'll put my bow in the sky and it'll be a token to me when I see that bow." You see a rainbow, you say, "Oh, how beautiful is." That's God's God's token. &gt;&gt; And with a bow, rainbow over him with feet and say, "Time's run out." And besides that, he raised up his hand and swore that time would be no more. And if you look at the word, the time will be no more. It is the delay will be no longer. It won't be delayed for this revelation to come. And here it's going right to that scripture at the first seal because now he's going to go the first second through the seven seals and the questions and answers on the seal because God has declared I will not delay this revelation any longer. Time will be no longer. Everything's going to stop. I'm going to reveal this thing. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad you say, "Well, I've read the seals. I don't UNDERSTAND IT. OH, PRAISE THE LORD. I'm glad you can understand everything. &gt;&gt; I don't understand everything. &gt;&gt; Don't look at me that way. &gt;&gt; You don't understand everything. I don't understand everything. But we can believe it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely can believe it. And we must believe it. &gt;&gt; Just let me finish. And besides that, he raised up his hand and swore that time shall be no more when this happened. How perfect it is. And then he declares what it is. Everybody's attention. A sworn affidavit to the church. And a sworn affidavit. This is this is what an affidavit is. How many don't know what an affidavit is? Raise your hands. That's what Don't be ashamed. All right. This is what an affidavit is. It's a written, sworn statement of fact. &gt;&gt; It had to be written. &gt;&gt; John the Apostle had to carry the burden of the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to scribe it. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to translate it. Somebody had to carry that burden. Somebody We got a brother Wong up there. Brother Murphy Wong. No wonder he comes so under the power of God. He just lives in that every day. He just speaking that word every day. Think of it, friends. Think of it. Wouldn't that be wonderful to have that as your job? It just in it all the time. You may wonder why I'm so exercised cuz I've been doing nothing. I've been sitting alone and sitting with these words and pondering and seeing the scripture. What am I SUPPOSED TO DO? HAVE TO COME TO CHURCH AND SAY IT. &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, YOU YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SO EXCITED." YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M so excited about this. I'm more excited about this than the than the football or the NHL or the NBA or anything else. I'm more excited about this. WE'RE BEEN CALLED AND ELECTED. YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, I wish I were you. I wish I had the youth that you have to live this uh live this glorious life and revelation OF JESUS CHRIST. SAY, I'LL LIVE. THEY THEY LIVED WHAT THEY didn't even understand. &gt;&gt; I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. THEY LIVED EVEN WHAT THEY didn't understand. THEY JUST LIVED IT. GOD CALLED THEM TO GO PLACES. THEY WENT THERE NOT GOING, NOT KNOWING WHERE they went. They went BECAUSE IT HAD TO BE WRITTEN. YEAH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM HAD TO WALK BY FAITH BECAUSE IT HAD TO BE WRITTEN. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE he was going &gt;&gt; and had trouble with Lot and the herdsmen and all those things. And he doesn't ask, you know, he doesn't say, "Oh God, oh God, I got all this trouble with Lot and HIS SERVANTS." THAT'S JUST INFATISIMAL. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean anything. What really meant something is God made me a promise &gt;&gt; that I'll have a seed &gt;&gt; and my seed will inherit this place and that had to be written because it's going to mean SOMETHING TO US. GOD HAD a seed. &gt;&gt; YOU WERE THAT SEED THAT SHOULD come &gt;&gt; and THE PROMISE WILL CAR BE CARRIED WITH THE SEED. The fact that you're a son and daughter of God, you have inherited through Jesus Christ because that was the beloved son. Oh, I I'm having a hard time stopping. But this is what an affidavit is. It's a sw a written sworn statement of fact voluntarily made. God didn't have to say it, but he voluntarily said it by an individual under an oath administered administered by a person authorized to do so. And I say one thing, God sent the most authoritative voice. He didn't have to, but he knew this would be a a disbelieving generation. So he sent a prophet that you couldn't even squeeze around. And that's why he said thousands of times, is that the truth? Is that the truth? Because it was the truth. And in the in the spirit of truth, uh, a great part of it is my own testimony in there that brother's relating it. Brother Brandham's relating it. I say that is absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; Absolutely the truth. What he said is absolutely the truth. I don't have to go back and fix anything. It's absolutely the truth. And God, I'm getting across here and I'm ending now. And God lived it. He had men live their lives and women live their lives and family live their lives to lay down a script called the Old Testament. And then Jesus came and fulfilled that. Subjected himself to what man had written. Subjected himself because he knew it was come from God. &gt;&gt; Holy men as they were moved by the Holy Ghost wrote and prophesied of the scripture. And then they had to live their lives. And Jesus lived his life. Jesus put people young ladies through agony and mourning with their brother dead in the tomb. made them go through a whole funeral and everything else so it COULD BE WRITTEN FOR US here in the end time. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And then to have a prophet say, if you only knew who this God is, WHO'S IN OUR MIDST TONIGHT. IT'S NOT TOMORROW, NOT NEXT SUNDAY, NOT LAST SUNDAY, but tonight. He knows exactly where you're at. He knows your deepest secret. He knows your deepest need. And many people they came up before brother Brandham one came up and he had epilepsy but he said that's not your real need. Your real need is that you're not born again. You not accepted Jesus Christ as your savior. And the man acknowledged that and he received it right then. Oh friends, what a gospel. &gt;&gt; What a message we have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I say we are prepared. I say it in faith. We're prepared to bear the burden of the word of the Lord. This church has sought to do that. And I'm more determined myself now than I ever been my life. We're going to carry the burden of the word of the Lord. Hallelujah. It's always been a burden to get this prophet's word out in the languages of the people. That shall continue. &gt;&gt; That shall continue. &gt;&gt; Amen. that shall continue. &gt;&gt; We're obsessed with that. That's not just some works. That's not merely some works. That's what we do. That's who we are. &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory to God." And I want you people to pray for every person that even extends themselves in any way, any form, any shape. Whether it be to Seattle or Brother Kyle to Victoria or to somebody you've never seen or known before, it's one body. It's one bread. Whether they're in Africa or whether they're in China, whether they're in Poland or whether they're in Russia, it doesn't make any difference. Amen. &gt;&gt; I had a call first thing this morning at breakfast. Please come to uh Mexico City. Brother Ron Caldwell, I think I thought you put them up to it. That was brother Francisco. I said that sounds I told my wife I said I think that's brother Ron Caldwell put them put him up to that and probably gave him my home number. Anyway, that's fine. Brother Ron, they have a wonderful, this is 60th anniversary, 60 years when Brother Brandham was in Mexico City, okay, this coming spring and they want they want to have a meeting. They have an annual meeting down there. But once more, this is this is our burden. It's just one of our burdens. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. Oh, I believe the true report. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that, shall we? Brother Ryan and Brother Nathan, you come up and help us sing it. &gt;&gt; I hope I haven't kept you too long. &gt;&gt; Amen. The whole theme is I don't know where the burden of the word of the Lord started but sometime before time &gt;&gt; and then there wasn't much happening between Adam and Noah. But once Noah came, it was nothing but burden from then on. Amen. They lived it under types and shadows. They lived it all through Jesus. Lived it all through his time. Lived it all through the New Testament. And we're not going to say, "Well, I don't think I want to carry it." And we're not going to say going to say we're not going to be like I I read last Sunday, you know, where brother Pam says that ministers and their congregation sometime put the pressure on them and and then the minister bends under the load. He bends under it and you know gives in and then so on so forth. I'm glad you're not that way. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't feel any I don't feel anything coming from the people saying we want you to compromise. No. Father, furthermore, you want the people to know we don't want any compromise. You just continue to preach it straight. You'll preach us right into the rapture. Every man that stands behind this pulpit just preaching something and I'll obtain something. Even when you don't realize it, God's pouring it into you. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Better start singing, Brother Ryan, cuz I'm not going to stop preaching. Looks like I believe the true report. Let's stand. Hallelujah to the lamb. Oh, glory Jesus on the san. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm living in praise. I sing and praise God. Hallelujah to my father. Glory to God. I feel I I know. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I am living in the presence of not just singing a closing song. That's not what we're doing. If we realize who is here, &gt;&gt; this God that we've talked about is here present. Present now. &gt;&gt; And because you believe the word, the Holy Spirit is able to go right out into the congregation. And I read I read one the prophet of God is he's preaching uh the testimony he's preaching God revealed to his people then the testimony and after the day after he got the tract this is this is one day 13th 14th and 15th day after he got the tract said where is God I cursed him his title the next night is who is God. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you get to the end of the service, I just I just scrolled down quick cuz I wanted to get to the end of the service. I knew that this God who's A LIVING GOD WHO is God. He's not going to leave the people with bamboozled their mind. He's going to come on THE SCENE. AND THIS GOD wants to you to know. HE WANTS TO COME ON THE SCENE more than you even dare to ask him. It'll come out into the into the congregation while you're singing and heal you. Something will start to move within you and you just say, "Do it, Lord. Do it, Lord. I'm here to receive from you." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He had the people waving their arms and thanking God in expectation what he's going to do. Now, here's the scripture I wanted to read for you. These words spake Jesus and lifted up. Now the thing when I say Jesus just think of the son of man. The only way God could become a father. The only way is to become a son of man. And Jesus now he lifted up his eyes to heaven. This is John 17. The only time in this Bible that that prayer is recorded. I thank God somebody described it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God somebody was listening and scribed it. &gt;&gt; And the hour has come. Glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he might give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. And this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God. Friends here at Cloverdale Bible Way if we in the ministry fail to make this God real to you that you might KNOW THAT THIS GOD IS YOUR FATHER. It's not just a phrase, but you know him and you can come before him and you can say, "Father, Father, if this sickness has been here to glorify thee, yet I believe thee for a complete healing, God bless you, Sister Heidi. God bless you, Sister Louise Wood. I tell you that this God &gt;&gt; wants to heal these people." &gt;&gt; Do we as a people believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes. and to go out the spirit of God. The spirit of God is the spirit of healing. &gt;&gt; You that need re revelation SAY I NEED TO I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND. May God go out in the congregation. Open up your mind and your understanding and help you to comprehend. I pray it. I had to pray it this week several times. I prayed earnestly. Oh God, help me to see this more clearly so I can say it and speak it to the people. And this is life eternal, that they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. Aren't you thankful that God sent a prophet to tell us exactly how out of the bosom of the father came the son of God? &gt;&gt; I have glorified thee. on the earth. I have finished the work that thou gavest me to do. And now, oh father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory that I had with thee before the world was. &gt;&gt; There it is, brother Nathan. That answers it. before the world was with the glory that I had with thee before the world was. Now you hear it and you can see it from the message so clearly. We go back in little drama and we see this glorious light coming out from the father. This father that fills all time and space and in his bosom is to be a father. I am a father. I don't have a son. I am a father. I have children. And through Christ, he may bring many sons to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't stop preaching BECAUSE I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO stop just yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glorify thou me with THE GLORY THAT WE HAD. And friends, in the mind of God, in that great mind were all THE CREATION, EVERY FISH AND ALL the colors and all the plants and all the fruit and all the seed life. In that mind, but in there, in that mixture, there was I and there was you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there was the son of God who would redeem us. And God says, "No matter what happens, no matter how dark, no matter how terrible the sin, I'm going to redeem them." Hallelujah. I'll bring the woman at the well. I'll bring the Moses who murdered a man. I'll bring them because THEY'RE IN MY MIND AND I'll pay the price for them and THEY ARE MY ELECTED SEED. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. OH, glory to God. Help us, Lord, to accept all of that. &gt;&gt; I've passed the outer veil. All right, brother Nathan. We'll just finish now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. But the blood has brought me in to God's holiness so clean. Sal hallelujah to the lamb. Hallelujah. Hallelu glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I am living the rest of the heavenly father. I'm just coming now at the closing of this time together but not the closing of your presence with the people. You will walk with them as you did Lord Jesus with Cleopus. I say in the name of Jesus let it be so with every man and every woman. Let us go beyond the veil of this flesh. Let us see that it is Christ who draws near himself and goes with us. Goes with us in the automobile, goes with us to our home, is with us when we lay our head on the pillow. And I will never leave you nor forsake you, sayeth the Lord. Oh God, let it become more and more a reality. And when the brothers come to minister on Sunday, may this whole atmosphere be quickened. Father, go out among the congregation, oh God, with healing and with deliverance, and all manner of need shall be met in the name of Jesus Christ. And for the glory, for the glory of God, we thank you, Father, and we gladly bear this. We're privileged and honored to bear this burden of the word of the Lord in our age. We shall not sherk it. We shall move forward, Lord, with new vigor, &gt;&gt; new energy. &gt;&gt; We thank you for the challenge of the word of God. Thank you, Lord, in Jesus' name. Heal everyone, oh God. &gt;&gt; There's a need of healing. Father, it's a simple thing for you to heal. Our sister Wood, we're thinking of her just now. Oh God, we've seen her here in the service. Our sister Heidi, oh God, our sister Heidi know neighbor. I pray, Father, that she will receive absolutely everything you have in store for her. We don't want to live here, Lord Jesus, without receiving the full benefit. Touch every person, Lord. Seeing our sister Deborah here, bless her, oh God, with blessings from on high in the name of Jesus Christ. Let us live in the glories, oh God. Let us live in heavenly places in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. I want you to turn around and shake hands with a brother and sister near you and let them know there's another blood wat bloodbought bloodwashed saint beside them. Amen. God bless you, brother Nathan. Jesus name. Go. I'll I'll repeat what brother Brandham said so many times. Go and be happy. Hallelujah. You know what he says here in this who is this God? I can't even stop. He says, "You got a prayer card? Throw that up in the air. Throw it down on the ground. You don't need that prayer card. We don't need a piece of paper, friends. We don't need some aid." He said, "Just throw it up in the air. You don't need those prayer cards anymore." Glory to you, God. That's the kind of Pack it home. Glory to God. Amen. Heat. Heat.
