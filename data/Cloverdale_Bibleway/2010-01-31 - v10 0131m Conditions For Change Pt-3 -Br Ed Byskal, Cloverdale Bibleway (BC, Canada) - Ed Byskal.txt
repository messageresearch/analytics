Oh God, we're looking for a new body. We're looking for the promise of your word to come to pass in our daily lives.

In this presence, we want to go to prayer this morning. I'll ask Michael if you'd come this morning, Brother Michael, and lead us in a word of prayer. Several requests to mention before the church this morning. Brother Israel from Seattle would like to request that the saints pray for the mother of Sister Sharon, another sister from Seattle whose mother is in a comeomaosse condition since yesterday. She's under assisted breathing respiration at this time. So we just ask that the Lord would move on her behalf this morning. Deliver her. Brother Juan Carlos is asking that we pray for his uncle Boris and son and daughter. His uncle's wife went to be with the Lord this morning in El Salvador. Just asking that the Lord would have his way. Just pray that this prayers of the saints, the Lord would comfort them, that family. Want to also pray for a complete healing of the uncle of Mr. Jose Fienza diagnosed in Vancouver General Hospital. He's been found with lung cancer. He's been given about 6 months to live. We know that all things are possible in Christ the name of the Lord. Amen. That he's this healer. That's from brother Leon Garland. So we just trust that the Lord will have his way this morning. If you have a need on your heart, Lord is more than faithful this morning. The water's troubled, friends. I'd say step right in. Amen. this morning. Make your no your need known by the uplifted hand as we go to prayer this morning. God bless you, Michael. Let's bow our heads. Precious Lord, this morning we humbly come before your throne, Lord. We're so blessed that we can have a place, Lord, to come to worship you. Lord, we can lift our voices up before your throne, Lord.

And Lord, we can only come, Lord, and sing hallelujah to the lamb. For worthy is he that was slain, Lord. Lord, we lift our voices before you, Lord. Lord, not only was Lord the attribute, Lord, but Lord an attribute of healing, Lord, Lord, for your Jehovah Rafa, Lord, our healer, our provider, Lord, this morning.

And we pray and claim it, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name this morning. Precious Lord, we've we've not only come to worship, but Lord, we come to hear from you this morning as well. Lord, your pastors, Lord, laid before your throne, Lord, we know and we pray, Lord, that we would draw upon your gift this morning. Not to see a man, Lord, but to see you speaking through him, Lord, to meet every knee that is here, Lord. Each one has come with something different.

God bless you each and everyone. You may have your seats this morning. Once again, we want to welcome each and everyone into the house of the Lord this morning. [Music] There's uh Sister Chan, I believe it is, visiting from the Philippines from uh Pastor Rivano Gill's church over there. Where is she this morning? Maybe we can get you to stand. Here you are. Right here. God bless you this morning. Amen. Amen. We've got quite a Filipino congregation in our own congregation. Where's our Filipino friends this morning? Raise your hands. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Brother Ernie's been traveling to the Philippines for I think 27 28 different trips. I think this year will make 29. And uh pretty soon he's not going to have to travel there to see his friends. They're traveling here. So, praise the Lord. Ask brother Tom to come this morning. And I think he's got an announcement or two before we any further. Morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love the presence of God? &gt;&gt; And I just want to worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. In spirit and in truth. Looking forward to what the Lord has for us. God bless you all. Um there's a reminder here that the US and Canadian donation receipts are still available at the office after the service today. That is one remaining uh announcement that needs to be said. But I'd like to make an announcement to our young people. I've talked to brother Kry Diggs this week and uh brother Kry I've um shared meetings with in Quebec last May and um we're going to have a camp a winter camp and it's going to be March the 11th to the 14th. We will get in on a Thursday night and we'll have Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. And we're going to have a time. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a time &gt;&gt; cuz I know brother Kry and I know his his uh his desire for the things of God. I said to brother Biscll, I said um I've preached a lot of camps over my course of life around the uh the states and over into Europe and I preached with a lot of men. But I've uh had a special connection with brother Kiddry because I I have been mentored I guess under brother Bisll and found out that when you travel you don't travel so much you get to a location and you end up in a room and you stay in that room until the meetings are over and if you get a day off after that day that you fly out that's what you get. And um different men have different ways that they uh prepare and that's just something that we do. and uh with brother Kry found a kind a kindered spirit in the sense that he would not leave his room and he would be praying through the night early morning late at night after the services I said that's my kind of man and uh he is a wonderful brother and Lord willing he's um he's committed to coming so we're going to have that winter camp it'll be grade 8 up to 25 years of age plus what we're going to do. We're going to make it available cuz with brother Kry's kind of ministry, it is um it's a ministry that actually will uh will benefit the full scope that is even here. And um we're going to open it up, of course, to the young couples that will um help at at senior camp. And um I know that's one way you can get to camp if you're a little bit older, what we call, you know, middle age around 23, 25, you know, that age. So, we're going to make that available to you to come. And um I want to say something to the Drake family. Uh God bless you all. The whole clan. I'll just blanketed that. I was up at the camp Thursday and Friday. We had some business we needed to do up there and I got to stay at at the I think we're going to rename it. It It was called the right cabin and I It was the right cabin for me. Uh it was beautiful. You've done a great job. And I drove by and saw Ben's cabin. what Ben and the brothers did and it was phenomenal. I said, "I love this place." &gt;&gt; Why aren't I at this place more often? &gt;&gt; I mean, the presence of God is there and you see what the lab the labor of the sons and daughters of God. It's a great event. I don't Pat, I don't know how much you work there, but letting Dave all do all the work, that was phenomenal. Thank you so much. And it'll be a blessing to all. So, we're going to try and squeeze as much as we can and if we can creep up into that older group, you know, around 30-ish, we're going to squeeze you in. We're going to fill up the camp and we're going to try something a little bit different. You just have to pray that the log uh chapel gets just bigger somehow. We'd like to maybe crown it the the meeting with everybody there on the Sunday morning. Brother Biscll and I are going to talk about that. We're just going to try and see where we can shoehorn everybody in, but we're going to have a blessed time. &gt;&gt; So, be remembering the meetings uh in the youth camp. It'll be March 11th, the 14th. And God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Does that sound wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. How about a hand of applause to the Lord for providing this opportunity? Amen. Praise the Lord. You know why it's called an opportunity? because without it something might not have happened but because it's an opportunity something else can happen that's what we want for our young people I know I didn't have camp growing up when I was younger many of you know my testimony and I grew up in a message church and I went away from the Lord from about the time I was 16 17 years old until I was 32 that's a very very long time to be out at sea a drift and I think back and I wonder if I'd have had a camp but I've given my heart to the Lord at camp spared myself years of scars and years of trials and what I've been sitting where you sit. Many of the ones that have grown up in the church and it's an awesome opportunity. Don't let it pass you by. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we sing My Hope is in the Lord as we turn the service to our pastor this morning, Brother Biscll. Just draw on the gift. We're here this morning. It's the Lord's day. Just center your focus upon what the Lord would have. I was praying this morning, Lord, just give us your heart. Give us the mind of Christ this morning for what you would do in the service this morning. My hope is in the Lord from this time on. [Music] Oh my home. [Music] Forever home. [Music] I stand in all within the presence of the Lord. In whom the wisdom of the age is alive, for whom the raging of the saints subsides. He's the living sacrifice. Your soul my [Music] Ever more [Music] his tender mercies come with every rising sun to be the savior in his brokenness to offer healing and forgiving. Hallelujah in those who trust. We believe this morning Lord our hearts and red [Music] is in the world. My home is in the Lord forever. [Music] Oh my Lord. Let's all sing this morning the anthem of the church of God. Let it sound out. Oh my [Music] is in the love forever more. [Music] Oh my heart. [Music] [Music] My hope is in you, Lord. [Music] Hallelujah. Let's sing that verse again. That the last verse you sang. [Music] And our mercies come with every rising sun and truth. To be the savior in his broken day to offer healing and forgive. And those who trust me with my heart and my is My home is in the Lord forever more. Hallelujah. He's worthy of all praise. He not. Amen. It's wonderful. Wonderful. I'm just going to let you have your seats for a few moments. And we're going to have uh next Sunday, February 7th, we're going to also have communion and footwashing the Lord's table. It's always a wonderful time. &gt;&gt; And we I would have announced it just a little bit earlier because especially those who like to come up from Seattle and usually there's quite a number like to come up. So, please tell your friends and those that are in the Seattle Tacoma area that want to come. Maybe sometimes they come from the Okanog and they come from far away because communion and footwashing is important to our us as believers. And so, we just want to welcome anybody who's within driving range and wants to come and be with us. You are just uh so so very very welcome. It's a blessed time and we'd love to share it with everyone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Love the worship. &gt;&gt; Just seems to set the tone and gets us ready for the word. I I I just felt it was so uh so appropriate. Well, Brother Ryan, how does it feel any different? No different. Where's Sister Yelena? Up there. Well, we what we want to do, I want to have Brother Ryan and Sister Yolena, if you would come down, please. We want to pray a prayer of blessing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; On this young couple. Don't you think that would be appropriate? &gt;&gt; How many here didn't get to go to the wedding? [Laughter] All right. Well, at least we can participate and we can pray a prayer of God's blessing upon this union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that we want to do. Uh we'll just have brother Ryan and and sister Elena come down and join me here at the front. The other thing too, brother Ryan, bless you. Sister Elena, God bless you. Uh, the streaming con congregation need a chance to see this couple. &gt;&gt; So, be sure who's ever doing and handling the cameras, get these cameras on this couple here. They want to see him right now in Switzerland and Germany and Holland and Belgium and different places. And we want to express also our thanksgiving to you, brother Ryan. And now you, Sister Leena, have become a part of his ministry. You know, I remember and recall uh there seemed to be a time or a season when things just begin to change in brother Ryan's life. It just seemed to take on a different dimension. And it's in keeping with what I want to speak and minister this morning. And it is that there are times in our lives when God draws near. And when he draws near, everything changes. &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful change. And I was thinking, Brother Ryan, Sister Elena, that when God called Abram, he didn't know what was in store for him, but he found himself at Bethl and uh he made an altar there and he worshiped God. And the Bible tells us that later on he went back and revisited that. And so I want to say to you as a couple, there are those times when God seems to draw very very near. And I'm sure he was very near while you had your uh vows spoken and uh your loved ones, your family. You have a wonderful family, Sister Elena. Wonderful family. and you've chosen a wonderful wife. And I want to just say to you as a as a friend and as a pastor, don't forget to go and visit Bethl again. And that's good for all of us. Remember that time and that place that was just special. and you can go back there and you can meet him and talk to him. And so I'd like if you all would just join with me and we're going to pray God's blessing on brother Ryan and sister Yena. Father, these dear, precious lives that you have allowed our footsteps to cross their pathway. You've allowed their lives to be a blessing to us, Brother Ryan, and his gift and his talent. Has been dedicated to your service. He's heard your call. He's been faithful father and now he has a lovely bride that has come and joined with him and they together will be a blessing I know to multitudes. I pray that you'll bless their home. I ask that you'll bless their lives, oh God. I pray that you'll bless them with health and strength and good energy and keep the enemy far from their door. I pray let there be a wall of fire around them and may the Holy Spirit guide them. Speak to them, Lord. I pray you'll speak to them in such a way individually and as a couple. Speak to them, Lord. Cause their lives to be h to have an impact, an influence upon others. Oh God, how we need them, how we need them. May they be true soldiers of the cross of Jesus Christ. And I pray that Sister Yolena, oh God, will rise, oh father, and be one of the wi take her place with with the great women of the Bible. Oh God, great in dedication and consecration. And and we see these qualities in her. And I pray that you'll bless them now. Father, you'll guide their footsteps, provide for them. I know that you will. And we bless them now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Ryan. Amen. You didn't expect that, did you? No. All right. Well, and you didn't expect it. God bless you. There are some things that are just appropriate and right and that that I I just couldn't see us go on in this service without having the recognizing brother Ryan, sister Elena. Amen. And in our services, I would like you to remember, please, if you would, uh, the worship part, even when we leave the sanctuary and go out in the foyer, the prophet says in our giving, in our tithes and our offerings, we're worshiping him. And so when you go to the tithes and offerings, I want you to think of it as an extension of really what we're doing right here. And that's what the messenger said. We worship God in tithes and offerings as well. And that's an important part of our of our worship to the Lord. And uh it's how we are able as a church to uh serve and do what we're supposed to do. So we thank you for that so much. All right. If you'd like to stand and I think that'll be all we'll need. Thanks. I'll have you turn to uh the book of Luke, the 24th chapter. This is a very familiar uh scripture reading, but I'd like to say there's nothing wrong with hearing it over and over, is there? &gt;&gt; How many times have you heard Coca-Cola advertised? And how many times have you heard them say the same thing? And uh sometimes I hear these ads and radio and I I think these people think that I'm stupid or something and I can't remember what they said, but they just keep repeating it. &gt;&gt; They repeat it because, you know, it's a it's proven to be successful. And the Apostle Peter said he was saying those things uh to put us in remembrance. And so often many times we hear something and we hear it when we hear it again and we hear it we hear it actually differently &gt;&gt; and God says something different to us about it. So uh it's to put you in remembrance also. This is the scripture uh brother Brandham read. We won't read all of it. Uh we're going to start at the 13th verse. But this is the uh text that brother Brandham took and used in modern events made clear by prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And which I have been so conscious of and want the church to be conscious of. When we read this, we're reading a prophecy that is being fulfilled with us in our time. Starting at the 13th verse. And behold, two of them went that same day to a village uh called Emmas, which was from Jerusalem about three score furongs. And they talked together of all these things which had happened. And it came to pass that while they communed together, and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, "What manner of communication are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad?" And one of them whose name was Cleopus answering, said unto him, "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?" And he said unto them, "What things?" And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel. And beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done. Yay. And certain women also of our company uh made us astonished which were early at the sephiler. And when they found not his body, they came saying that they had seen also seen a vision of angels which uh said that he was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sephiler and found it even as the women had said, but him they saw not. Then he said unto them, "Oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And may he do so this morning. &gt;&gt; May he expound in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. We we'll uh bow our heads in prayer before we uh go further into the scriptures. Oh, how lovely you are, Lord Jesus. How wonderful what an atmosphere have been has been here in the service and the worship has been accepted. We we sense the spirit and the warmth of the nearness of your presence Lord and I pray that you'll bless this congregation of people that have come together and all who are connected with us at this time. I pray that you'll reach out, oh God, into the rooms and into the homes and into the places where people are meeting and especially here throughout this building, oh God, in the nursery or wherever the people are. May the presence of the Holy Spirit and not a different presence but the only presence the one who came on the day of Pentecost when that tree was planted that original tree what your prophet said was his tree your tree Lord I pray that it'll bear forth and bring forth much fruit in the name of Jesus Christ I surrender myself to you oh God that we just might be a tool in your hand and all the glory goes to you give us a grand time in your presence. I pray, Father, I pray there will be a yielding and a surrendering throughout the whole audience. Oh God, every man, woman, and child, Lord, that just might say, "Here I am, Lord. Take me." And may I be may I be pleasing in your sight today. We thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. I have been speaking on uh conditions for change and this subject of change is such a vast subject. It can come from so many different directions and I want to have you think of change but in a little different uh from a little different direction. So I want you to think about change that comes about through restoration. Restoration the power of restoration. You know, restoration is is something that you can sometimes there are people who are special specialists and they restore furniture and somebody else restores works of art and they take things that are uh they can't make them new, but they restore them and make them seek to bring them back near to the original. A true restoration is to restore something back or a person or a thing to restore it back to its original condition. &gt;&gt; And only one can do that and that is one who made it original in the first place. &gt;&gt; He's the only one who can really restore a life, restore uh restore us the kind of restoration that we need. And furthermore, we weren't made. We were not made. It is not God's design that we should live just merely the life that we're living. That's not God's program. And so in the original plan, he's the one who has the original plan and we are we are to we are being restored or he has he has put forward a a uh I won't say a program but it is a it's an operation. It's called an operation of God in the scripture. It is a predestinated plan by which uh his children will come back to the very original uh plan and thought that he had for us in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is the act of restoring to its former place or its former condition. We're still in January here and winter is gripping most of the country yet and my message this morning is is very much towards uh Easter and yet I I couldn't get away from it. So I you know Easter doesn't have to be at a certain certain time as far as the ministry is concerned. Uh but Easter is a time of restoration. &gt;&gt; It is when uh the earth begins to take on a new look. Uh there's a fragrance from buds that are springing forth. Life is coming. Life that's been hidden down into the roots. Uh things and trees and bushes and whatever more that look so dead you'd even look at them and and and you know people who are in brother Don Alexander's business and brother Don he knows how to uh come and I've had him look at at trees for me and I said this thing looks dead. you know, and he'll scratch it or do something and say, "No, there's still some life there." Uh, and uh, you know, some of us look pretty dead. And we just had to have the right person give a touch &gt;&gt; and say, "No, there's still some life there. There's still some life there." Brother Brandham says that he wanted to ask he he did ask what intelligence is it that sends the sap &gt;&gt; and the life back down into the roots. What intelligence causes that tree? You know, it hasn't got any human intelligence, but the leaves drop off and the life runs back into the roots. And that's exactly that's why Jesus is called the root of he's a root. He's the branch and the root &gt;&gt; both because the life the the life was back into the roots. God held it back. But now in the scripture which we read this morning and this scripture has always had very very deep and special meaning to me and I trust that God will allow by the Holy Spirit today to give us a different kind of a service and let you enter in to even this short phrase. Jesus himself drew near. &gt;&gt; I think it's one of the most precious phrases in the Bible to me. when Jesus draws near. That's why I made the comment I did to brother Ryan, sister Yolena. Young people or individuals, we can just be, you know, roaring on our own direction. We got our own plans and we're going places and we're going to study and we're going to get certain uh, you know, uh uh uh uh certain program. we're going to we're going to do things and we're going to have a certain job. We're going to live in a certain city or we're going to live in a certain country and we've got things all mapped out and we got it all figured out. we're going to go a certain direction which may be perfectly fine and then one day we just become aware there's a different presence around us &gt;&gt; and when Jesus draws near we start to pray in the in the in the study this morning and Tom led in prayer and the first words out of his mouth he not knowing what I'm speaking on but he said he just opened his mouth mouth and said, "When Jesus comes, &gt;&gt; the tempter's power is broken." &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes, I can tell you when Jesus comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that he isn't here now, but when he comes in a a a greater intensity, when he comes near, &gt;&gt; you know, when he comes very near to you, and I pray that he'll come near to you today while we pro make progress through this message and have different scriptures and different quotes and things, that's all fine. But, you know, in me speaking, that's fine. And I might feel so inspired and I might feel so anointed, but it what's this service won't be what it's supposed to be unless the author &gt;&gt; unless this one who came near to these two men on the way to Emmas draw near to you where you are in your seat and you begin to feel his presence and in a different intensity and it begins to warm you and begins to break you and and sometimes there's tears and sometimes there's revelation. And sometimes there's the word just becomes a a new book or a or even just a scripture or maybe this phrase and Jesus himself drew near. There might be something in your heart right now saying that's what I need. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for. &gt;&gt; And I'm looking for the same one that came and been in the message of restoration of the bride tree and how the prophet of God speaks of God planting. He said he planted his tree on the day of Pentecost and bringing forth the fruits of that tree, that Holy Ghost tree, and and restoration is to go back to the original. I have a longing in my heart &gt;&gt; for what God planted on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; I have a desire for that. God never changes his plan or or his program. And I realize that we're not, you know, we're not here just desiring a lot of, you know, signs and and and and those kind of things. But on the other hand, I would like everything that God wants to bring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When they're sick amongst us, I'd like to see them healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we expect that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why should the devil trample over our faith? &gt;&gt; Trample over our confession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When we have a need in our family or a need in our home or a need in our lives, why shouldn't we expect God to step on the scene? That's what was planted on the day of Pentecost. And that's what we're to expect today. Why live below our standards? [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whenever he came near something different happened. We have Jesus in his first coming and then he died and was gone and then he returned in the resurrection and then he left and ascended and then he promised in the end time and even this scripture today is a prophecy. He promised in the end time he'd descend again. &gt;&gt; And we wouldn't even have known unless a prophet said, "This is his word coming." &gt;&gt; His word coming. &gt;&gt; He drew near, friends. &gt;&gt; And I I trust that I will be able to convey to you. &gt;&gt; In the breach, I'm just setting uh setting a little bit of a a direction now. And when the seals are broke, he said, "The mystery is revealed. Down comes the angel, the messenger, Christ, setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head." Rainbow because he's a covenant angel. In other words, the word is returning. &gt;&gt; And the covenant, the rainbow over his head. And he said, "Now remember this seventh angel is on the earth at the time of this coming." &gt;&gt; I will say this, however a person wants to interpret that, I will say this. Jesus Christ has drew near in this generation. &gt;&gt; He's drawn very very near in this generation. And he can I can tell you that he can draw near and people can miss him. He can be near and you might not even be aware of it. There there also is an essential part which I wish to touch on later on and that is that uh with with God there needs to be a recognition on be on the be on the part of the people. That is why brother Brandham preached the unrecognized presence of God because the presence was there. Can you imagine Elijah was there? The presence was there. The pillar of fire was there. He was seeing it over the people. And many of the people failed to recognize, even failed to acknowledge, failed to be willing to believe it was there. They could have benefited from it, but they chose to disbelieve it or to doubt it or to criticize it or to find some reason why they wouldn't enter into it. But for my part, and your part this morning, we need to determine I want to enter into all of it. I want to receive everything that I can &gt;&gt; from that presence. &gt;&gt; I want to recognize it. Clear my vision. Lord, don't let me don't let me have scales over my eyes. Let me see you here this morning today. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let this not be just another Sunday morning service. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said in his wonders to perform. &gt;&gt; Notice his wonders to perform. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said you go to singing hymns. Brother Derek, thank you. We've sung hymns this morning. &gt;&gt; You start reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; We did. &gt;&gt; And he says that stranger &gt;&gt; will appear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to say, Lord Jesus, that's why we sang hymns this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, that's why I read the scripture this morning and we read about you coming near to two men and here are men and here are women and here our children. May that same Lord Jesus come near to you. &gt;&gt; Are you ready for it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; he said, "And while those went on the way to Emmas along the road, begin to talk about him &gt;&gt; that he stepped out of the bushes and walked with them through the day." He said the reason we don't have the spiritual blessings he said we have too much time said to watch television too much time to read the newspapers or listen to some things that we ought not to be listening to and we do and he says we are not redeeming the time but we're giving it to other things of the world instead of our time to the Lord Jesus. He said Christians live on the word. &gt;&gt; May this congregation live on the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wasn't able to come to be at the uh Friday night prayer service and I understand the young people came and joined and and we've there's there's a desire within the people and I believe that uh I believe that God has us on a on a a different direction and is increasing intensifying. It doesn't mean that everybody has to be, but it's wonderful when you can get a a large group of people together and especially introduce the young people into prayer and so they can hear uh people praying. &gt;&gt; I like to hear people praying. I like to hear young people praying. And we were we were affected as we heard a couple weeks ago and there wasn't that many maybe 40 50 people there but we heard some of our young men praying and uh not only young men but sisters as well but we were impressed by some of them that were opening their heart. Now this uh the scripture which we read it's an amazing account in the scripture because there's no event in the scripture. There's no event in the scripture that records uh the event as this one is. This is very unique and I I want to I want to really take some time with it. There's nothing that's even similar. Brother Brandham calls this of the re of the resurrection and the crucifixion. This is the greatest week. I'm saying these things for a very specific purpose. The greatest week in all history. So would you acknowledge that &gt;&gt; this is the greatest week in all history. &gt;&gt; It was the very moment of the unfolding of the resurrection. And the resurrection wasn't known yet. It had happened, but it wasn't known yet. This was just the first first little uh ray of light that was coming into the minds of the people. They were still bewildered, but a resurrection had taken place and they were not aware of it. Uh women that were from the church, from their company, had been to the tomb to the sephiler and he wasn't there. They couldn't find the body and they were concerned about that and they'd seen a strange vision as it were. But the resurrection had taken place and yet this is the paradox. It was one of the saddest times for the believers. &gt;&gt; One of the saddest, most confusing and distressing time for the believers. And yet in another realm it was the greatest week in all history. &gt;&gt; I say that because we need to be aware &gt;&gt; that God is not being controlled or governed by what you and I see happening on a a dayto-day basis in our daytoday life. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God declares declares that everything is moving right according to the plan. &gt;&gt; And I believe that &gt;&gt; everything is moving absolutely according to the program of God. And it's not out of cater one bit. &gt;&gt; What about this or what about that or what about something else? There are all kinds of things and always will be things that we don't understand. Things will happen to us individually and happen you know in our home or whatever more but we don't understand it. In the rising of the sun he said this is the greatest week in history. The greatest celebration of all times the Easter this Easter is where he proved what he said. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. the evidence of the resurrection stepped out of the bushes &gt;&gt; and started walking with these two believers. Could be two believers that are sitting here. I want you to think now of the blending of two worlds in this world that they were in. In this world of circumstance, they were consumed with the recent events that had taken place and incidentally were in complete reversal of what they had planned and what they had expected. So in this world which is a world of circumstance in this world their eyes were holden. In this world, they could not see uh the things as they actually were. In this world, they were unable to see that scripture was actually being fulfilled. They couldn't see it. There was nothing to comfort them. &gt;&gt; There was nothing to comfort them. &gt;&gt; It was all distress. It was all a terrible tearing. &gt;&gt; You're quiet. Preach it. Preach it. &gt;&gt; This is a reality. &gt;&gt; This isn't a story. This isn't mythology. This is what happened to two believers just like you and I. And not two believers. It happened to the women. It happened. They went with the spices to anoint the body. And the body's not there. It's not what they figured out. It's not what they had expected. It had It had been very, very different. In this world, they were reasoning. In this world they were reasoning but gaining no understanding. &gt;&gt; In this world they had a lot of questions but there was no answers. In this world &gt;&gt; in this world their hopes and their expectations had been dashed &gt;&gt; for they said we have trusted &gt;&gt; that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel. &gt;&gt; We trusted that it would be he. This was the one we had trusted that would redeem. Now, and the word redeem, and brother Brandon goes into it, and perhaps I can touch on it a little bit further later on, but to redeem is a powerful powerful word. Brother Brandham takes it, he said it's to loose. &gt;&gt; They're loosed completely. &gt;&gt; No one has any power over that. When he says to redeem, and he would redeem a nation or redeem a person, and when you're restored, he can't restore you unless he redeems you. And he took you, the prophet said, he takes you away from Satan &gt;&gt; the same. And he's taking the world away from Satan the way he took you away from Satan. &gt;&gt; I'm rejoicing this morning that God has taken you and I away from Satan. &gt;&gt; He took us away from Satan. And we can sing and say, "I am redeemed. I am loosed. I have been taken away from Satan. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Of course you do. Confess it. &gt;&gt; Speak it right in the face of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Say, "Devil, you thought you had a You thought you had a hold of me. I've been taken away from you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I've been loosed. &gt;&gt; I've been liberated. Amen. &gt;&gt; The ransom has been paid. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The bonds. And how we love that song, worthy, worthy, because it speaks to this truth. We've been loosed. And Cleopus and his friend, Cleopus and his friend were actually peering into another world. the blending of the worlds. They were peering into another world &gt;&gt; and they didn't know it. &gt;&gt; I'm I felt compelled to tell this congregation, not knowing who would be here this morning, the events in 24 of Luke are brought we are brought face to face with those same events through the ministry of God's prophet in this generation. We are we have been allowed to peer into another world. &gt;&gt; And just because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not happening. &gt;&gt; They didn't realize it. You may not realize it, but listen to this little preacher this morning. It's still the truth. &gt;&gt; Another world is very near. [Applause] They were living out a prophecy that they didn't even realize it. They didn't realize it. They're just walking down a road, their feet becoming dusty. Their the their hearts are heavy. The the end of the world has come. Their master's been taken. The secretary of the church has committed suicide. And they're all scattered. and the great people of the assembly and the leaders and the elders and the deacons and the trustees or whatever more are all locked up. The apostles are locked up and behind barred windows and doors for fear of perhaps the Romans or whatever is happen. Everything's collapsed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There was no hope anywhere. &gt;&gt; And there was even nothing in their expectation of it maybe get better tomorrow. Amen. &gt;&gt; But here they are, believers peering and looking in to another dimension into another world. And they didn't even realize it. And that is our portion. That's your portion. That's what this message, this message isn't come from the earth. This message didn't come from a Bible school. This message came from eternity. And when you read it, you peer into another dimension. You peer into another world. You peer into eternity. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The scripture even tells us of the prophets and the seers of old &gt;&gt; searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify something that was in them was telling them this is for another time but this is such a oh God show me what this is all about and it and it and they wanting to know what the scripture signified when it testified beforehand and they spoke of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed. He said unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves. And I say about these men, Cleopus and his friend, it was not even their life. And what's recorded here was not unto themselves, but unto us, but unto us they did minister. I'm preaching this this morning because to tell you Cleopus and his friend and the prophet of God comes down in one of his last services that he preaches is that the modern events are made clear by this prophecy. Now we need to look at this prophecy and understand our events today. &gt;&gt; Understand our life. Understand the environment and the circumstances that are taking place in our world. and be able to say wholeheartedly, they did minister to us. &gt;&gt; And now I need to see what they ministered. &gt;&gt; They were looking at the first fruits &gt;&gt; of the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were actually looking at the first fruits, &gt;&gt; but it was just a man &gt;&gt; and he spoke and we understood them. There's nothing nothing spooky about this. &gt;&gt; It was just a man and they were looking at the first fruits of the resurrection. There had been others that had been raised from the dead, but this was different. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Vandom describes why it's different because he said there's been many babies born &gt;&gt; with a great, you know, that that were wonderful people. And there's been many men that have lived for a great cause. But Jesus Christ, there was no man that died like he died. And no man, there had been people been raised from the dead, but this one raised himself from the dead. &gt;&gt; He said, "Never a man raised himself up." Amen. &gt;&gt; Cleopus was looking at the proof &gt;&gt; from almighty God. &gt;&gt; He was looking at eternal life. &gt;&gt; He was looking at the first fruits. He was looking at a man who raised himself from the dead. &gt;&gt; He was looking at the proof of all humanity. &gt;&gt; He was looking at the proof that he could lay down for you and I. &gt;&gt; He looked at a man who raised himself from the dead. And the prophet of God in this end time had to go and lay hold of that scripture and bring it forward to show us in a restoration of the bride tree be because here was now a power. This was a different kind of a power. He could enforce it &gt;&gt; and show us that we can enforce it. We have the right. We have the authority to enforce the law of God upon Satan's head. &gt;&gt; Please receive this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were in this world, but they were looking at not merely the evidence of the resurrection and the first fruits. They were looking at the very one who had crushed the head of Satan. He had already raised also in another realm. They were looking into another realm, peering into another realm. And the prophet of God has said, the scripture tells us, he rose with the keys of death, hell, and the grave. &gt;&gt; They were looking at the most momentous sight they could have ever have seen. Here was the one who had the keys of death, hell, and the grave. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But they're just like us here on January the 31st, &gt;&gt; 2010. They didn't know it. &gt;&gt; I want to say to you as believers, we don't know what we have. &gt;&gt; We don't fully know what we have. We may appreciate it with everything that's in us, but you are literally walking with eternal life. if you have eternal life, but you're walking you're walking and peering into another dimension because there's no no people on the face of the earth that has the message that you have. &gt;&gt; My wife has said to me, you've been on a certain direction. It seems that you're speaking about this channel, this you know how the prophet is a certain channel. I cannot emphasize it enough. &gt;&gt; That's the orphice through which we can peer right into eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the authorative voice that tells me what kind of a body I'm going to have. &gt;&gt; This is the authorative voice that tells me what kind of a home I'm going to live in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's time for us not just to hear it in a Sunday morning service, but to go out these doors and say, "I confess this every minute of the day. I believe it. I'm going to hold this up in the face of Satan. I'm going to hold this up in the face of an unbelieving &gt;&gt; world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "There's been many fine babies &gt;&gt; born and there's been many fine men who've suffered and died for a real cause, &gt;&gt; but there's never was one &gt;&gt; that could raise himself up until this day. Until that day, &gt;&gt; they were peering. They didn't realize it. They couldn't possibly realize it. They were born in sin shaped in iniquities like all other men. These two men like believers that we are. And they were looking at the absolute justification of their soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They were looking at at the justice of God having been paid. &gt;&gt; They were looking at at that which God looked on and was satisfied. &gt;&gt; Think of it. They were looking on the fulfillment when God spoke to Adam and Eve and said, "In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." &gt;&gt; Here they were looking. They were they were the first ones able to walk with the one who actually satisfied that statement &gt;&gt; because Jesus Christ had died &gt;&gt; to satisfy that command &gt;&gt; the day thou eatest there thou shalt surely die. And he took the death penalty &gt;&gt; for us &gt;&gt; for them. They didn't realize the death penalty had been paid on their behalf. &gt;&gt; To them, it was a cross. To them, it was a cruel crucifixion. To them, it was a tomb. To them, it was a body. To them, it was a bewilderment. Where is he? &gt;&gt; They were so connected to the material world that they couldn't they they were unable. And that's why Jesus took them all through the scriptures to speak of the things concerning himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will say one thing. The message has come in this day to connect us to connect you &gt;&gt; with eternity. &gt;&gt; The message has come to answer your questions. &gt;&gt; Maybe not about all the material things that happen here, but the message has come to connect you with eternal things. God help us &gt;&gt; in another world. I have just written down they were walking with this greatest victory of the ages. &gt;&gt; They didn't know it. They didn't realize it. You and I are sitting here today and if I said to you, we have the greatest message on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, you know, is that supposed to make me happy or what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to get up and jump? Am I supposed to, you know, shout because brother Brandham has brother Ed is saying this that Brother Brandham has, you know, brought this message and all these things and the seals are open and so and so. What does that mean? I don't even know how how close are you? I'm I'm going to be speaking some things that are really strange. How close do you think you might be to the seven angels that actually spoke to brother Brandham about the seals? So, why are you saying that? Well, the people up in the Baptist church, they don't care anything about the seals. They don't care anything about a mysterious cloud. That doesn't mean anything to them. And then you find a group of people and there different degrees. Some don't have much interest in it, but there's others that even read it and reread it and stay with it and they read the scriptures and they don't understand it. But you keep doing that &gt;&gt; and he &gt;&gt; will draw near. &gt;&gt; He will come close to you and it won't be flashes of lightning and thunder and all kinds of great sudden things and suddenly, oh, I know and I see it now. No, it doesn't happen that way. They just walked along in their daily life and kept doing what they always do. Walking where they were going, going to their home, coming to their house, asking the stranger to come in. And little by little by little it just uh you know it dawned and the light begin to shine and they begin to see and and hear the stranger now is starting to speak about Moses and about Christ and the prophets and about Christ in in the Psalms and David and they're they're being uh you know their hearts are burning now. &gt;&gt; Their mind is not registering anything but their hearts are burning &gt;&gt; within them. And I pray that this morning there'll be something that will be so said and punctuated by the Holy Ghost that you'll say, "There's more to this message than I have seen. There's more to what's happening than I understand. Oh God, here I am. &gt;&gt; I open up my heart to you. I open up my whole being to you. I want to live for your cause and live for your purpose. &gt;&gt; Show me what I need to see. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about getting too spiritual. You won't. &gt;&gt; They were looking directly at the proof. And the prophet said in super sign, he conquered death, hell, and the grave and possessed its gates. Rose on the third day in a supernatural resurrection. Said, "I have the keys of death, hell of the keys of death, and hell." Amen. I was he who was once dead and now am alive forever more. And because I live, the seed of Abraham shall live also. That's what had happened. And they were walking with that. &gt;&gt; What are we walking with? &gt;&gt; I personally believe that the angels who even brought the the the the message of the seals to the prophet, &gt;&gt; I cannot feature that they have ever left. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; The message &gt;&gt; very far. sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They've never left it very far. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I believe those angels are near. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I want to just add another uh another aspect here to this now and to I I hope that you will believe me and I trust that I will be able to emphasize to the point that you'll lay hold of it things that you've heard. I'm not wanting you just to remember them. I want you to take it and that your life will be changed by it because uh there are things that are said, things that have been spoken, the message that have been said. Quite frankly, friends, I don't believe that it has enough place in our homes and in our lives and in our time. We need to give more time to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say amen to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the scripture tells us that the that there's a law of life and brother Brandham uses this. I want to I want you to absorb the words. There is a law. There's a law outside just outside the building that's a speed limit. And that is a law. And we have all kinds of laws and regulations. Those of you who have Nexus cards to go across the border, there's more regulations to that. It almost scares me. I'm wondering if I got an old piece of fruit or something in the car. I I know that there's nothing in the trunk, but I go and look anyway, just in case I happen to forget something cuz I don't want them to uh strip me of my Nexus car. That's Oh, I just love passing all those cars that have to wait in the in the lineup. But we all have laws. There are laws. And there's laws in the land. There's laws, you know, in the government. And you may not have thought about this this morning till now. But there's a law in you. God has put a law. Not a law of just healing. There is a law of healing in your body. But he put a law in you. And it's called the law of life. Yes, &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's the law of life in the word that God has sent us. There that word and we call the message. Let me say to you according to the word of God. This is thus sayaeth the Lord. There's a law in that word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There are some conditions and one of the conditions is you have to recognize it. &gt;&gt; That is the one thing you have to recognize it. You have to acknowledge it and that is that is the one thing the plant the plant that is uh you know uh in the ground and the pulp has run out. There is a law of life in that seed life in that botney life and uh when the sun draws near that life starts to come up. &gt;&gt; In other words, the sun the su n draws the life right out of the seed. Now the prophet's message, brother Brandham's coming was for this purpose that the son of manl &gt;&gt; would be revealed again. &gt;&gt; He'd be made known again. &gt;&gt; He would, in other words, I want to in the context of the service this morning that he would draw near to the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the son of man, Jesus Christ, would be would draw near to the people. And this is his channel. &gt;&gt; This is the chosen vessel &gt;&gt; that he chose to come near to the people. &gt;&gt; There was a time when the people saw the lightning and the thunder and the burning of the fire on the mountain. And the people said at that time, don't let God speak to us directly. They said to Moses, "You go up &gt;&gt; and come down and tell us what he said." That was the first instance. There's no prophet prior to that. &gt;&gt; That Abraham was God's prophet, but I'm talking about a prophet to the people. &gt;&gt; And so through Moses, God drew near to the people. &gt;&gt; Through Moses, God came close to them. Through Moses, they were ransomed. Through Moses, they were redeemed. &gt;&gt; Through Moses, they were loosed &gt;&gt; from Egypt's bondage. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Through Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God used that vessel &gt;&gt; to come near to the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why the scripture tells us this is such a remarkable ministry that we've been called to the Holy Spirit confirming the word in our time. Such a remarkable ministry that God has called us. He's called us. He's if I could put it in this language. He said th this is the this is the revealing of my son. This the revealing of the son. I've called you under that revealing to make that known. And do we realize that's the whole thing. Do we realize &gt;&gt; what has actually taken place? &gt;&gt; Say, well, I know it mentally, but I want to that we should that we should experience it in reality. &gt;&gt; There was a law in Cleopus and his friend and this was the law that they would recognize him. They didn't know that. But there was a law in them saying even beyond their own understanding, the law was saying, if I can put it in my words, you are going to recognize him. &gt;&gt; You are going to understand what this experience is all about. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's like the law that's in the seed of the little flower. The law is saying you are going to respond to this sun. &gt;&gt; You are going to come up under all of this dirt and mud. &gt;&gt; You are going to have a flower. &gt;&gt; There's a law in you and you are going to smell pretty. &gt;&gt; You're going to give off a fragrance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there's a law. It's not just in this old flesh or this old shell, but there's a law in you saying you're going to shine &gt;&gt; with the glory of God. &gt;&gt; There's a law in you say you will understand this word because you are ordained to understand it. &gt;&gt; You've been made to understand it. &gt;&gt; You've been made for this word. You're fit together as husband and wife. &gt;&gt; His bridegroom your bride. That's the law. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I the sun drawing near to them would make effect of the law that was already in them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We today have a law of life in us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To fulfill the promised word for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the nearing or shall we say the returning of the sun. The nearing of the sun. Don't doubt that part. There's many in the message that's not a big thing with them. They don't understand and they perhaps can't catch the significance or the importance or why brother talked about the people in denominational world. He says they don't understand the great this great joy that we have &gt;&gt; cuz the joy that we were experiencing made others angry. &gt;&gt; So the very joy that we have upsets people, distresses people. The very joy that you have, the things that have caused you to see such glorious things, such lovely things, and cause you to love the Lord Jesus more. Others say you're in a cult. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, any cult that can make you love the Lord Jesus more, that's a cult you want to be in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, the sun was drawing near and it forces Satan, the author of death, to lose his hold and loose those that he has held. And a prophet keeps using this phrase and I'm going to keep coming back to it regardless of the conditions. &gt;&gt; So you see friends, we could sit down and tell everybody and and share with each other our tale of woes, but all I can do is say to you this morning, say what he said. He said say what the t say. Say what the message says. And the message says regardless of the conditions. regardless of the conditions. Over and over and over again, he said the same thing in restoration of the bride tree. How can there be a restoration if all the conditions are going to affect it? &gt;&gt; The restoration takes place regardless of the condition. &gt;&gt; You need to say that regardless of the condition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that good news? [Applause] Maybe if you feel like you're in an impossible situation, &gt;&gt; I could just have you raise your hand and we'll all pray for you &gt;&gt; and I could raise my hands too and you can pray for me. But I have a word. I have a promise. And not only a promise in a book, not only a promise spoken by a messenger, but I have the law in me. &gt;&gt; I have the law in me &gt;&gt; according to the scripture which says that the law of life in Christ, we have that in us. &gt;&gt; And the nearing of the sun, the nearing of the sun activates that law. [Applause] The seed, the seed when it dropped off the flower that was dying in the fall, that seed had the life in it then. &gt;&gt; And when it was covered over by all the doctrine and denominational everything else and was cold and frozen in the ground, this the that law was in it yet then. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then the and then the cold winter split the seed open and it was just a empty shell and the pulp the pulp that was inside still ran into the ground and the law was still in there. &gt;&gt; There's nothing there's nothing that can destroy God's law of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Am I preaching for you? &gt;&gt; Surely not preaching just for myself. I'm preaching for you. &gt;&gt; This is a reality to me. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's just let's just look at the conditions that these believers had that these believers have. We have in inferiority complexes. There are those who are troubled with a low esteem of self-esteem. They don't feel like they're worth anything. Satan loves you to think about that. He loves you to think about that and he keeps stoking that fire &gt;&gt; when you get pondering and thinking about that and and and conditioning your life or maneuvering your life to accommodate that low esteem or this complex some complex you have say well I have some complex because of my childhood or the way I was raised up or the God is greater than your complex. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; The government and the school and educators and nothing nothing against our educators. We got some of the most wonderful ones in our school. I'm not opposed to that at all. Like I had I've had people come to me and say, "Can a Christian psychologist help me?" Well, they can help a lot of people. I don't think that they can really help a believer &gt;&gt; that's walking in the fullness of the word &gt;&gt; simply because now I'm not I'm not diminishing them. &gt;&gt; I'm simply saying that what the believer has is greater. &gt;&gt; What the believer has is a greater answer. And the world becomes increasingly a troubled place. &gt;&gt; If you think for a moment that we're going to kind of break out into a beautiful place and there's not going to be any of these things, you're mistaken. &gt;&gt; We're going to have all kinds of problems and troubles. Right. &gt;&gt; And if I wish to, if I wanted to think of my youth and my childhood, I feel I have a right to be able to speak this this morning because uh as as I don't speak about my youth and childhood too often once in a while. I had my wife speak about it, but it was a sad life and I spent an awful lot of time alone. And you've heard it and I'm not going to go into it again, but you know, I I had I' I've seen people and they they they they lost a loved one and then they wouldn't let that go and they just mold over on that and and let that grief and sadness just bring them down. But if we have our hope and if we're and if we're seeing into another de into another realm if we're see the merging of these two worlds as it were and we we are a people where these two worlds have merged &gt;&gt; tell me what other spiritual leader listen to me church what other spiritual leader of any church you all can say it if you're believers of the message but what other group of people that fill the churches in this land today can say our leader said on a regular basis and proved that I'm in two worlds &gt;&gt; and described what was in the next world and described what was in this world and see them standing there and and and this happened not hundreds of times thousands of times &gt;&gt; and we need to ask ourselves why did God do that for us? Amen. &gt;&gt; Why did God give us that kind of a leader? &gt;&gt; He gave us that kind of a leader because you are a people that need that kind of a doctrine. Because you are a people that are that God is literally merging the two worlds to. And you're going to step into another one and leave this one. &gt;&gt; And if we haven't got that as a hope, we might as well pack it up and leave go out of here and have a nice dinner. &gt;&gt; That is not only our hope. That's a reality. &gt;&gt; As much as it was for Cleopus, they were walking, they were not only walking uh uh in this world, they were walking with another world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus never came to into into this realm right where they were walking. He walked in the dust of the earth. He ate some food with them, whatever more. But he never depended on natural food anymore. He never would go to a cross anymore. Why? Cuz he was in another world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we could understand something about God. God is the one who made this world and made the other one. &gt;&gt; And this one is just a negative of that one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Satan can work in this one, but he'll never work in that one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're here celebrating his defeat. &gt;&gt; We're here celebrating his utter embarrassment. &gt;&gt; We're here to tell Satan, "You have no control over these people." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And should we rejoice? Of course, we should rejoice. And more of us ought to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Our enemy has been destroyed. and I no longer belong to him because I've had Elijah tell me that God took me away from him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. [Music] &gt;&gt; He forces Satan, &gt;&gt; the author of death. He forces him &gt;&gt; to loose you [Applause] &gt;&gt; not brother Biscll speaking this God has spoken it through his messenger &gt;&gt; there's a law of life in every believer &gt;&gt; and he says this here's now thus sayith the Lord here's Elijah speaking to you I only repeat his words Regardless, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Regardless of how low &gt;&gt; how little &gt;&gt; we are. &gt;&gt; Regardless of how low we are, &gt;&gt; how low are you this morning? Say, "Ah, I'm I'm scraping. Scoop me off the floor with a scoop shovel. I'm so low. Ah, I've had so much." Oh, Brother Bisc, you don't know what kind of a week I've had. Well, I can tell you here I give you thus says the Lord regardless of how low you are &gt;&gt; and regardless of how little we are &gt;&gt; and regardless of how impure we are &gt;&gt; and regardless of how unholy we are &gt;&gt; or how sick we are &gt;&gt; or how afflicted we are, &gt;&gt; the Lord Law of God's spirit by his word makes it obey him. &gt;&gt; Not obey you, but obey him. He is the author of the law. He put in the scene. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How low are you? Do you hear me? Do you listen? Do you believe? Regardless of how low you are, regardless, [Applause] &gt;&gt; this law is not subject to any conditions. &gt;&gt; Regardless of the conditions, &gt;&gt; and you may sit here this morning and you don't need it exactly the way I'm preaching, or you might need it tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; All the props, Satan might come in like a flood tomorrow morning and knock all the props out of you. You want to say, "Regardless of how low, regardless of how unholy, regardless of what's happened, I have a law in me because I'm a believer of the word of God." And there's a law in that seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God's word. [Music] &gt;&gt; Regardless of how depressed or you are, &gt;&gt; regardless of how discouraged you are, [Music] &gt;&gt; regardless of the depth of your spiritual need, &gt;&gt; regardless of your physical ailment or whatever more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Till &gt;&gt; till you say it, till you believe it. &gt;&gt; Lay hold of it. Confess it. &gt;&gt; While I was studying this, Brother Richard and Sister Barbara, I prayed for Daryl. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That devil's a liar. &gt;&gt; And the law of life in Jesus Christ is greater than that diabetes. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Friend, sometime you have to just stand up &gt;&gt; in the face of Satan. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I know my wife, she doesn't want me to do this, &gt;&gt; but I feel that I need to. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the midst of preaching this service, I went to uh I was taking cholesterol pills for a few years and so I went off them and I went back and took blood tests. He says, he looked at my wow. He said, "Were you were you sick when you had this test?" I said, "No." And so he gave me some reading off of that which I won't bother speaking of. He said are you diabetic? I said no. Said you are now. What? Said I don't have any. I don't have any problem. No. I said well what's what's a normal? Oh he said even seven would be high. I said what's mine? He says 13.6. sex. Oh, no. And he says, you know, he saw where I was going. He said, "No, no." He says, "You're clearly diabetic. I'm preaching this in the devil's face." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not just that, yeah, you in your mind, a mind over matter. I accept it. I disregard it. I deny it. &gt;&gt; With everything that's in me, I deny it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I prayed for Daryl this morning. He'd been on my heart for some time. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think of that man that brother Brandham went in with him to pray for for his 12-year-old girl and she's laying near to death and the nurse is and the man is speaking to the nurse and he's trying to express his faith and she's telling him what the medical diagnosis is for her and he simply says you know in the southern way honey he said you are looking at the at the monitors. You're looking at the instruments. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm looking at the promise." &gt;&gt; And that's the difference. &gt;&gt; There's no there's no eternal life law in the instrument, &gt;&gt; but there's a there's a law of God &gt;&gt; in the word, in the promise. &gt;&gt; God said it. The prophet said, "I believe it." And that settles it. &gt;&gt; You believe that? You need to believe it. You need to confess it. You need to speak it. Because if you don't need it today, you will need it sometime along the road before we're out of here. &gt;&gt; It's a lie. &gt;&gt; Even some cold, dismal thought can come through my mind or your mind and tell you something about yourself. If it's not in harmony with God's word, &gt;&gt; I want you to say right then, Satan, there's a law in me that's greater than anything you can speak, &gt;&gt; greater than anything you can do. It's greater than any sickness or greater than any affliction. I have a law in me [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; but there is a condition and that law will bring about a great change. But there is a condition &gt;&gt; and the one condition the one requirement that's needed is the son &gt;&gt; must draw near. Amen. &gt;&gt; And another thing you can say to Satan, &gt;&gt; he has &gt;&gt; drawn near. &gt;&gt; Revelation 101 tells me that he descended. &gt;&gt; He didn't descend for the trees or for the water or the ocean or the whales. He descended for me. &gt;&gt; He descended to come near to me. The son has come near. Jesus himself has drawn near to me &gt;&gt; and it causes the law of life in the seed to come forth &gt;&gt; and that law defeat any enemy [Applause] &gt;&gt; and if it doesn't then we find ourselves to be just bearers of idol tales. &gt;&gt; Is this truth? &gt;&gt; What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought since Jesus came in. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know who here might have a complex, but let it let you ought to sign on to this today and and sign it because I'm mixing up with my words because I've got so much I want to say about it. Do you know that the messenger, God actually sent the messenger to bring a decree? &gt;&gt; A decree. and you want to exercise that decree, &gt;&gt; Satan comes to you because he's a deceiver &gt;&gt; and he's already under a sentence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has already sentenced him. &gt;&gt; In the scripture that brother Brandham used for the restoration of the bride tree, one of the scriptures was Abraham went down into Gar with his wife Sarah. Brother Ram calls her grandma, but she was so beautiful. The young king of IMC wanted her to wife and took her and he heard from the princes and everyone this young beautiful woman came and they took her and she said I'm his sister because that's what Abraham told her to say and the king prepared to take her and now now that happened so that it wasn't just a little text the prophet took to preach on &gt;&gt; he's telling he's announcing to you and I. He's announcing to you, friends. God sent brother Brandham to announce to you &gt;&gt; that this is the season &gt;&gt; for the bride to be restored back &gt;&gt; to her original place. Number two, that there is a law in you because now the word was coming out of a mouth of the prophet, the original seed &gt;&gt; with the original life, &gt;&gt; with the original law of God in the life &gt;&gt; coming into the hearts of the believers [Applause] &gt;&gt; and presented it to you. So that this lying spirit and all his lies of deception have no more power over you any longer. &gt;&gt; And you can say to that complex and say to that spirit and say to that depression and say to all this discouragement, you are under the sentence of almighty God, the sentence has already been declared, there's a decree upon your head. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the decree that God gave to Aimilec, &gt;&gt; restore the man back, his wife, &gt;&gt; or you're as good as a dead man. &gt;&gt; And you I heard I you heard me say it here the other Sunday, but you didn't know where it was coming from. God is simply saying to Satan, "Give them up." &gt;&gt; He's saying to the grave, "Give them up." When Jesus descended and went down into paradise and all the Old Testament saints were there, he said, "Give them up." &gt;&gt; I've got the keys of death, hell, and the grave. Give them up. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Cleopus and his friend are just like us. &gt;&gt; They were going home for eat, right? They didn't know just in another world paradise had been emptied up. &gt;&gt; They didn't realize. They didn't know. Jesus didn't come and say, "Hey, you know what? I'm Jesus. There's been a resurrection. I resurre. That's why the tomb is empty." Come on, folks. Get with it. &gt;&gt; That's why they couldn't find me there. Cuz I'm not there. I'm here. He didn't say it that way. He went to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Or he could have said, "You know what? &gt;&gt; He He could have said, "You know what? Matthew's going to write it in just a little bit of time, but the streets of Jerusalem is full of all the saints of the Old Testament saints. Abraham, your father's there. He's walking down the streets. All the saints are resurrected." He didn't say anything like that. He could have, but he didn't say that. That wasn't the kind. He wasn't trying to convince them mentally. He was trying to convince them from the scripture. The scriptures been fulfilled because that's the seed that has law in it. And when he came close to them, when he came near to them, the law became active. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm here to say to you today, the victory that you have and the kind of life that you have and the victory and the power that you have experienced in Christ, &gt;&gt; you have it because the son has come near. &gt;&gt; He's drawn near to us. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's drawn near that he might be glorified. Oh, &gt;&gt; he says, "Oh, I'm going to close shortly now. If we could just think of that for a minute." &gt;&gt; And that's just when he had said how low we are, how impure we are, how afflicted we are, how whatever we are. He said, "If we could just think, if we could just think of that for a minute, force is it &gt;&gt; regardless of conditions. No matter what the condition is, the law of God's word forces the condition to cope with his word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to our God. &gt;&gt; I'm not shouting at the message. I'm rejoicing. &gt;&gt; I'm rejoicing as a son of God, at the law of God that's in his word. [Applause] [Music] And to those that are streaming, I just feel uh compelled at this time. Maybe someone who's streaming is in a place of sickness or in a place of desperation. The law of God in the life of the word that we've received forces that condition to cope with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's greater, friends, &gt;&gt; than any weakness we may have. It's greater. &gt;&gt; It's greater than any spiritual affliction. It's greater. &gt;&gt; Don't go out of this place with some complex plaguing you. That complex has no right [Music] &gt;&gt; in this house of God. &gt;&gt; Don't be depressed and discouraged. It has no right. You can't find it in this Bible. And they shall be depressed. &gt;&gt; And they shall be discouraged. &gt;&gt; And they shall be down in the dumps. No, that's not in the word of God. &gt;&gt; They shall be loosed. &gt;&gt; And to the redeemed whom he has loosed &gt;&gt; by his blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every time the Lord Jesus drew near, it was for a specific purpose. &gt;&gt; He drew near to Moses. It was Christ and Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he drew near to Moses because he had a specific job to do. specific task. He drew near when he came and visited in his first coming and walked on the earth. He drew near and he drew a group to him that would be faithful and and because he drew near, they would be the witnesses &gt;&gt; of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Because the book of Acts must start out on the witness of the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; That's the theme of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; And that's the foundation of the church. &gt;&gt; He's raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; Victory over death. And he was the first fruits. That's the whole testimony. &gt;&gt; If that was gone, &gt;&gt; the whole thing is lost. The whole foundation of the church is gone. Listen to me now as I come to a close. And that is why when Jesus drew near to these two disciples, they were on the verge of losing it. &gt;&gt; And Jesus was determined because the whole church must be founded on the resurrection message. &gt;&gt; He's risen. &gt;&gt; He's not here. He's risen. And when Jesus met those two on the way to Emmas, they didn't know where he was. &gt;&gt; But when he when he revealed himself out of the scriptures and opened their eyes and opened their understanding, what did they do? They ran to the other apostles and said, "He is risen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, they were right on target. They knew what they were supposed to say. &gt;&gt; Amen. They didn't go and say come into the room where the apostles were and say, "Do you know what? We just had the most incredible experience." What? What happened? Well, uh, my friend and I were walking along the trail and a stranger walked and joined up with us and we just walked along and we're complaining and so they didn't go back and relate all that. &gt;&gt; They just came with the whole heart of the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's raised. &gt;&gt; He's risen. &gt;&gt; That's all he needed to know. Everything else was just unimportant. He's risen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I say to you, in the name of Jesus Christ, Jesus himself has drawn near &gt;&gt; in this generation. Yes. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know the ministry I am closing but you know the ministry I'm I'm on this thought Jesus himself drew near the ministry of Jesus and John or Jesus and the and Elijah the spirit of Elijah are so close together. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the angel came to Zachchariah and said, you know, he'll be great in the sight and he'll go before the Lord and prepare the way and he'll go in the power and the might of the of Elias. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will be going in the spirit of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Elijah that hadn't lived for hundreds of years. There had been Elijah and Elisha right after him. And now nothing. Brother Brandham says God takes this man but not the spirit. &gt;&gt; And so now Elijah, the spirit of Elijah comes and foruns Jesus. &gt;&gt; And it's Elijah, the spirit of Elijah. Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; The spirit of Elijah. And then Jesus broke on the scene. They killed John. And Jesus broke on the scene. And then the word went around, "John is raised from the dead." &gt;&gt; And they asked John, "Are you Christ?" No, not. And when Jesus came, they said, "John's raised again from the dead." Always getting those two confused. &gt;&gt; Elijah and Christ. Always. And then the spirit of Elijah comes in this day again. But why did the spirit of Elijah come to announce to the people? Jesus himself is drawing near. &gt;&gt; That was the purpose of the spirit. Prepare a way even before and tell the people. Get ready. Make ready. The kingdom of God is at hand. And Jesus himself drew near &gt;&gt; to reveal himself in the plan of salvation &gt;&gt; to the people and chose a group of people out, a small handful of people that would be that would testify to the resurrection. &gt;&gt; That was the purpose at that time. And now in the end time comes the spirit of Elijah again because the bridegroom is drawing near to the bride because he's got to make himself known to the bride because they're going to a marriage supper and they got to be married before they go to the supper. &gt;&gt; So he's got to draw very nearer than he had before. That's you folks. &gt;&gt; That's you. &gt;&gt; He came for you. &gt;&gt; He came to make this announcement to you. [Applause] Not the half million in Durban and how many more in Bombay and down in Houston, Texas and all those things. We didn't hear those beatings. We didn't see those great things. But he came for one purpose to get a bride. And he in the message of shame to him, he's in prayer. He says, "Let let let let me go and get your son a bride." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was that spirit that was in him calling out. He had to make a way for the bridegroom &gt;&gt; Elijah &gt;&gt; letting us know Jesus himself is drawing near. &gt;&gt; And he has &gt;&gt; and the other the other essential is that you need to recognize it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And by recognize it by recognizing it, it activates it. And that is why when Jesus had come very very near and was talking to disciples, he said, "Who do men say that I am?" Not who I am, who I was or who I will be, but who do they say that I am? &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "That's really wasn't the question. The question was, the next question was, but who do you say I am?" &gt;&gt; And Peter gave the right sir &gt;&gt; confession. Thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; He got the revelation of it. &gt;&gt; And that's what the that's what the son coming near was to do. &gt;&gt; So friends, conclusion in conclusion, every believer here has a a law in you. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I would encourage every believer here to give more time and focus and meditation on what it was, what it is that God has actually deposited in you. &gt;&gt; And that you should know there is no condition &gt;&gt; in the world. There is no circumstance that Satan can impose upon you that can even if he puts a block of concrete on the law of life is going to wiggle its way on the other side and come out into the presence of the sun. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful, wonderful treasure we have &gt;&gt; in this glorious word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; so thankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thanks for the inspiration. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, it's just wonderful. The Lord keeps pour pouring a little more in. I tell you what, I don't know what it means to you all, but it &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; That's what keeps it keeps me going. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That wonderful, that's what keeps us going. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you don't want to you don't want to forget. You don't want Satan to so uh uh complicate your life and so fill you up so that you you only think of this once every two three days. I want you to think about it in the daytime while you're doing your work and while you're doing your, you know, your duties in life. I just want you to think about that. I am a believer &gt;&gt; and I do have I have that seed in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and not for not only that, but that seed has a law in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is more than adequate &gt;&gt; for any condition. &gt;&gt; Any condition.

And and and and Elijah furthermore came to announce to us. Says, "We're going to hug one another." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He says, "And we're going to sit at a table &gt;&gt; that's been reserved as place reserved for you." [Music] &gt;&gt; And the king will come. Is this a story &gt;&gt; or is this reality? &gt;&gt; This is our expectation. This is what Elijah has said &gt;&gt; and the king is going to come. &gt;&gt; He's going to say, "Don't cry, children. &gt;&gt; Don't cry anymore." And he'll wipe away the tears from our eyes. There'll be no more death &gt;&gt; and no more sorrow &gt;&gt; and no more weeping &gt;&gt; and no more pain. &gt;&gt; What got us there? The law of life in Christ that's in us. That law got us there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think we can rejoice. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's sing a verse or two.

And then Jesus came. The words that came out of brother Tom's mouth. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes, the tempter's power is broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus comes, [Music] &gt;&gt; the tears are wiped away. He takes what? The gloom. &gt;&gt; This world's got a lot of gloom. &gt;&gt; And people live under a cloud of gloom. Don't do it, friends. &gt;&gt; Don't allow it. [Music] Will you give me a moment? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I always have felt this just the way my mind thinks. I always have felt if I give in to Satan, then I I glorify him &gt;&gt; and I sure don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; And I take away from the majesty of Jesus Christ and the power of his cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to and we must always point to the cross &gt;&gt; and tell Satan your head was crushed. &gt;&gt; Death was defeated. &gt;&gt; You cannot bring this cloud upon me. &gt;&gt; You cannot bring this lie upon me. &gt;&gt; It could be something. It can be something handed down. [Music] It could be something handed down. &gt;&gt; It can comes. It can come. Brother Brandham said, "This man came to Brother Brandham said, "I've got a stubborn spirit." You've heard me say it many times. He said, "I've got a stubborn spirit." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "Well, now I would have to go back." [Music] Could come from a father or mother or grandparents, he said, "Or an uncle. which I thought was very strange. It could just come from way back there. Dear friends, if you never hear another word I say, take this and anchor it in your soul. The law that is in you is greater than anything that was ever handed down. &gt;&gt; Amen. The law of life that is in you is greater than any complex or anything that we could have inherited or could have we could have uh it could have developed through the kind of life that we had to live or whatever more the law [Music] &gt;&gt; regardless &gt;&gt; of what the condition is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to sing then Jesus came. and the tempter's power is broken. Then when Jesus comes, it is. And I'd like you just to become real reverend and enter into that atmosphere. And if you feel it's you, you can reach out to him right where you are. We're going to have prayer in a moment. If you feel you need special prayer, you're welcome to come down and there's brethren that will pray with you. But I only those that are needy. Not not I want to go deeper with the Lord or I have a great hunger for God. Not that. But just exactly what I'm saying. If you have something that you have not been able to gain victory over this darkness, this depression, this I hate that spirit. &gt;&gt; I really do. I I have a holy hatred for that spirit. It depresses people and brings them down into the doldrums. &gt;&gt; And he has no right to do it. &gt;&gt; No right to do it whatsoever. &gt;&gt; So let's just sing this. When Jesus comes. Thanks, brother Ryan. When Jesus comes, the temptor's power is broken. When Jesus comes, the tears away. [Music] He takes the glue. and fills the life with glory. For all is changed.

Friends, this is the only reality there is in this world. &gt;&gt; And you have been called for a specific purpose in this end time. Friends, there's been no other people that I know of all through the centuries that have had this kind of a call. Cleopus, his friend, and the disciples were to witness the resurrection. By God's grace, we shall witness a resurrection. And more than that, we shall go with them &gt;&gt; into the rapture of the church. I'm going to ask you, brother Dominic, if you will come down, please, and pray a prayer of blessing upon the people while we sing the chorus once more. I am redeemer. [Music] [Applause] Jesus. [Music] I am. Before brother Dominic uh prays, he has a great deal to be thankful and happy for. uh about 2 3 weeks ago, he stepped into my office and he said, "Uh there's a a young lady who has uh immigrated to the United States and she just arrived there in November. Is that right?" That's right. &gt;&gt; I want to have my facts right. and uh he said uh I'm going to go there in a few days and ask her to marry me. That's the way I like it. It's simple and so nice and he's speaking with myself about it. We had prayer and and uh uh then he sent me a nice little email and he said, "Praise the Lord." She said, "Yes." [Music] [Applause] [Music] And so no doubt we will see her one of these days as well and she'll be here and joining our brother Dominic. Uh, I just appreciate the sincerity and uh, people may be up in the balcony as our brother Dominic sits there and you may not see him or ever get a chance to shake hands with him, but I can tell you one day it was this brother who said, "I I uh, I I sent an email to you and I he said I was going to send it and I didn't send it and uh have had such a God so spoke to him in the service. He said, "It's not really necessary for me to send it, but I'll send it anyway." Brother Dominic, it's one of the one of the finest emails I've ever received. It was lovely. It was lovely quotes from the prophet and and it just uh uh really speaks to a person's heart. I'm going to ask, brother Dominic, to ask God's blessing upon the congregation as we're dismissed. and then come back early, get a good seat, and be ready to hear the word tonight. Father Dominic, please let's bow our heads. El Elohim, Elma Honot. You're the creator of heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; You're the giver of all good gifts. and you're the author of eternal life. &gt;&gt; You're the one who is is to come. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Father. Because in this very age, this p this prophet spark what was in the mind of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we're here to believe. Not only to believe, but receive. not only to receive but to be obedient to the fullness of the word. That's what aneteras to the token and thank you father for the moment that we have to share with the almighty our pastor. What a masterpiece and we heard father by him and through the mind of the prophet and through the mind of the almighty god that we hear not to see or to be seen but to receive this spleen word which is the original seed. And thank you, Father. And we believe, Father, that in this very moment, we are going to witness just like the two disciples down on Nemiah Straight that how our hearts were really burning within inside us as God was speaking to us span the day. Thank you, Father. Now go with us as you going to bless the vessel that you used and be ready for brother Tomo to come forth with the word. And we can only say we committing everything into your holy hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Go with every individual each and every one of us. Father, if it's pleasing to you again, let us meet in this very evening in the name of the Lord Jesus. Granted, Father. Amen. [Music] You're dismissed in Jesus name. It's nice to be excited, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Nice to uh receive something that you know quite frankly I like to see when people gets down down inside and just want to really receive from him. So you're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] God. Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Happy [Music]
