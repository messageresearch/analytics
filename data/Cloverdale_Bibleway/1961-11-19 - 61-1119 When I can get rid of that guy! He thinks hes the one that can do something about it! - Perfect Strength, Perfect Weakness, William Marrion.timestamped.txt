[0:00] this great man who he sought God and he
[0:05] said God I am weak and I I don't know
[0:09] what to do I pray you God to strengthen
[0:13] me take my infirmities away from me and

[1:15] out of the picture but when I can get
[1:18] rid of that guy when I can get to a
[1:21] place that he's out of the way then God
[1:24] can come over and do things that we and
[1:25] RAM knows nothing
[1:27] about that's when God can use you your
