[1:09] brother saying come I pray you and hear
[1:13] what is the word that cometh forth from
[1:15] the Lord and they come unto thee as the
[1:17] people cometh and they sit before thee
[1:19] as my people and they hear thy words but
[1:22] they will not do them for with their
[1:24] mouth they show much love but their
[1:26] heart goeth after their covetousness and
[1:29] lo Thou Art unto them as a very lovely
[1:32] song of one that hath a pleasant voice
[1:34] and can play well on an instrument for

[1:42] come then shall they know that a prophet
[1:45] hath been among them
