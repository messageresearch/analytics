Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Bless your name, Lord. Bless your name, Lord Jesus. Bless your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. [Music] I'm going ask brother Tom Frey, Brother Tom, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. Sister Carmemella is requesting prayer for healing for sister-in-law has been diagnosed with cancer of the liver. The doctor said there's nothing more they can do. We want to remember her this morning. We want to remember the Jeffre family. Brotherh Wes Ardel's father-in-law uh passed away. Um and so uh we want to remember the family. Man, if you've got a need this morning, whatever it would be, just lift before the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. Tom, if you'd come, let's bow our heads, please. Most precious and heavenly father, Lord, we are so thankful, Lord, that we can be in the house of God tonight, Lord. We're just encouraged by one another's presence, oh God, as we lift our hands to you today, Lord, as we worship you, Lord. Thankful, oh God, to see those that are in the assembly, Lord. Lifting their hands and praising you, Lord, encouraged by it, oh God, knowing that there's a victory, Lord. That, Father, doesn't come from outward signs. It doesn't come from material things, but a victory, Lord, that you purchased, that you paid for, oh God. That Lord, maybe our human eyes may not grasp it. Our human intellect, oh God, can't understand it. But, Father, in in the word of God, it's been provided. And in the sacrifice you gave, Lord, and Father, we have the the not just the right, Lord, but the privilege to come before you this morning. An honor, oh God, to bring needs before you, oh God. That Lord, very, very needful things, oh God, upon the hearts of believers here in this room, oh God, and those that were penned. or sister Carmela's sister-in-law, I believe it is, oh God, who's been diagnosed with cancer, Lord, who the doctors have given up, oh God. And how many times has the prophet of God said over the tapes, Lord, that the doctors gave you up, but Lord, you never gave us up. And Lord, there's there is one amongst a thousand here, Lord, that that can mediate for us, that can take these needs before your throne, oh God, that can apply a token and can believe for, Lord, that which is impossible to man. And so, Lord, we claim, Lord, not just only this cancer case, but other cancer cases that are upon our hearts, Lord, other needs, oh God, that are upon our hearts. we claim in Jesus Christ's name, Lord, that the token that you have given us, oh God, we're applying it. And Lord, if there's anything that would hinder that token, oh God, into our own lives, anything, Lord, that would hinder the prayer of the saints in this room, Lord, we place that under the blood of Jesus Christ. And we ask Lord that you would take those things that Father we may have struggled with and those sins and the the weight that so easily besets us and we place that under that token blood Lord that nothing would hinder the prayer of the saints. Oh God to receive compassion for those that Lord the world has said there's no hope. And Lord, for our our brother Jeffy's family, Lord, our brother Wes's father-in-law who's passed away, Lord, and and any and all who are connected with that family, Lord. We pray for them today, Lord. Father God, we know that, Lord, in the flesh, it is a a very sad time, but in the spirit of Christ, Lord, what better reward could we know than to know a saint has gone on to meet you, Lord. And Lord, how that Lord one day that's our goal that we would meet you in your glory and Lord in a new body and Lord we know that our brother Jeff Lord is is on the other side but Lord Jesus their family members who are on this side oh God and we pray your compassion upon them Lord Father you're not m you're not unforgetful of them Lord you're mindful of Lord the families and and those that are left behind and you've given a comforter oh God and we just thank you for that Lord and ask that you be with that family, Lord. Lord, for the man of God that'll come behind this desk, Lord. There's many in this room who have prayed for him, Lord. And Lord, he himself has waited upon you into the wee hours of the morning and up early. And we pray, oh God, that the same God that met him before, Lord, and has been behind this pulpit before will come once again and speak to the people, Lord, from the vessel behind this pulpit. That Lord, if our eyes are on a man, Lord, we know that we've missed it. If our eyes are on words or things that are Lord just really nice sayings, Lord, we've missed it. But Lord God, may we go behind those things and go right down to the heart of the matter. Oh God, as our our brother would come, may he have the full freedom of the Holy Ghost to say what needs to be said and that we would hear what needs to be heard, Lord. And not only just with our ears, but with our lives. Live it, Lord. That we would be transformed and changed from the very eldest of us to the very youngest, oh God. that we would be ready for a rapture. Cuz Lord, the the times are changed. Lord, they're not just changing, they're changed, Lord. The things that are going on are happening so quick that we can't even keep up with them, Lord. In fact, Lord, may we just lay those things aside this morning and look to you now and ask, oh God, what would you have us to do? And what do you desire of us? And may you speak, Lord, in that manner to have your freedom behind this pulpit and with these people in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Got a couple of announcements and brother Derek Paris has a song for us. Brother Derek, why don't you come and get ready? Uh at this time um we want to take a moment to welcome all those who are visiting with us and uh some from locally. I understand we got a visitor from Simon Fraser University uh Prosper Philistine. We're happy to have you here this morning. Any others locally that are uh from our area. We just are really happy to have you here. And as well we want a special welcome for some uh some folks from out of town. Take a moment just to welcome them. Um, we have uh, Brother Hank, Sister Daniel Iverson who are with us from Belgium. Why don't you stand up? We can welcome you. Amen. God bless you. Good to have you here. And also from Malaysia, Brother Jesse and Sister Janice. Get you to stand up, man. We're happy to have you here. Um there is a senior choir practice at 3:00 this afternoon here at the church. And also uh an important announcement. We have uh a new member in the church here. Uh brother Marcus and Sister Anne Zeller are thankful to announce the arrival of their baby girl. born last Friday at 4:26 p.m. 6 pounds 12 ounces, 18 and a half inches tall &gt;&gt; if she was standing up. They're all doing well and they're thankful for that. And uh also an announcement from the school. Um most of you know that in less than two weeks the Y brothers are going to be here to uh sing us happy. Um, and for those who don't know, we just wanted to kind of make sure that everybody knew who they they are. Uh, these brothers are believers that have been in the message for many years. They attend brother Donnie Reagan's church. Uh, uh, and they sing, uh, with the Happy Valley song leader, uh, Brother Louie Blevens, uh, who's another wonderful believer. Um, the An brothers have written dozens of songs, uh, including one that we sing here all the time. All is well. Heard the message shalom. All is well. Uh they're very excited to be coming here to the church. It's been one of their lifelong dreams to come here and minister in song. And they're going to be singing some of their old favorites as well as some new songs, including one they just finished writing. And the school Bible uh Bible Way Christian Academy is sponsoring them, but uh sponsoring the Y brothers to come up, but they're so excited they're bringing their own brothers who play the piano and the steel guitar and um to to play with them. Brother Wes Ardel's coming out with them as well to be the master of ceremonies. He's going to be singing some of his own songs as well as singing with the Y brothers and they are good friends and often sing together in Tennessee. Uh people have asked questions how loud it's going to be. It's just going to be like here in the service. Um and I really think I'm going to be there. I think everybody if you like music but you don't like music, there's something wrong with you. Sorry, but there is &gt;&gt; cuz there's going to be singing in heaven. &gt;&gt; Okay, we know that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so so you know, one way to learn how to enjoy music is to listen to it. So uh I think uh um this is definitely going to be a once in a-lifetime event. They can't have it here at the church uh because it's a fundraiser. So, they're having it at a at a at an auditorium, but uh we're going to have church there, I'm sure. And so, come and be prepared to praise God. And, uh and um the seating is preassigned, so the sooner you sign up, the better seat you'll get. So, um enough said on that. The jerk. Amen. God bless you, saints. It's good to be here this morning. Uh this is a song that I heard uh three or four years ago written by a believer down in Trinidad. And at the time I heard it, it was very meaningful to me, but when David got sick, it meant a whole lot more. The title of the song is called The Dove Flew into my heart. And the inspiration comes from the message Brother Brandham preached in uh November of 1965 on the wings of a snow white dove. So I hope I'm not too nervous. This is a whole lot different than leading songs because you can help me when I lead songs. So, I trust it's a blessing to you this morning. [Music] I may be sick, but I keep on believing. I know that I'll be healed in Jesus name. The devil tries to rob me from my inheritance and the blessings the Lord has promised. I look at my lion vanities and say [Applause] I'm going to walk into my victory. [Applause] The dove flew into my heart. I know that he did. He has led me through the storm. I firmly believe the Lord has raised me up so high to believe what he has done for me. I'm an eagle to soar above the troubled waters. He has fluttered his wings in my heart. [Music] The dove flew into my heart. I firmly believe the dove flew into my heart. I know that he did. I may be troubled, confused, and shattered. I may be scarred, but I'll never give up. For he has promised deliverance from all my bondage. He wouldn't deny what he has promised. Jesus has provided all my needs. Whenever I call on his name, [Music] the dove flew into my heart. I know that he did. He has led me through the storm. I firmly believe the Lord has raised me up so high to believe what he has done for me. I'm an eagle to soar above the troubled waters. He has fluted his wings in my arms. The dove flew into my heart. I firmly believe the dove flew into my heart. I know that he did. The dove flew into my heart. I know that he did. [Music] He has led me through the storm. I firmly believe the Lord has raised me up so high to believe what he has done for me. I'm an eagle to soar above the troubled waters. He has fluttered his wings in my heart. The dove flew into my heart. I firmly believe. The dove flew into my heart. I know that he did. The dove flew into my heart. I firmly believe the dove flew into my heart. I know that he did. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Derek's wonderful song. We've got a baby dedication at this time. Actually, two. Um, Brother Toby and Sister Rebecca Caillumbi. And, uh, I'm going to have their little one dedicated. Maybe they could come up at this time as well. Uh, John and Sarah Bergen dedicate their little guy. So, if you could come up at this time. Let's sing together. Jesus loves me. This I know. For the Bible tells me so. Jesus loves me this [Music] tells me so much to him they are weak but he is strong Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. The tells me so. &gt;&gt; That song actually has maybe a little bit more meaning to me than you this morning. I was the proverbial drop them off at Sunday school and parents go home. And so I learned that song myself and I love that little song. But this morning we have a baby dedication of two wonderful couples that not only are sending their children to church. They're bringing them as a family. And that is wonderful. And God bless you, brother Jonathan, Sister Sarah, Brother Toby, Sister Rebecca. We'll take this little time to give God honor this morning for what we believe. I was asked the question one time, "What do you believe?" And I didn't give them a doctrine. I just showed them some lies. This is what I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what I believe. This is what I believe. This is what the message produces. This is what the word does. And you should give God the praise for that. Young couples, the only desire they got as young men want to serve God with all their hearts. And young ladies that God has blessed them with godly husbands and beautiful children. These are divine gifts from God. And we thank the Lord so much for them this morning. We're in an Exodus hour and we have used the scripture often out of Exodus 12 where it was commanded that Moses speak to the children of Israel. A lamb for a house. And we believe in the token of that lamb for the house, for its protection, for its blessing, for its keeping power, for its deliverance. We have believed that. And because of the token not just of to uh Jonathan's life and Toby's life, but because of their parents, they have godly parents. Parents that have gone through hard times, rough times for the word's sake, a token in their lives. And God has given them children. And now their children are bearing forth children. This is the blessing of the token. And we're thankful to the Lord for that &gt;&gt; and we bless his name. &gt;&gt; We have Max Jesse Bergen. I thought, man, what a handle. But if you've ever heard Jonathan sing, it's to the max. It's all right. Max means great or greatest. Jesse means gift but not only gift but it's a gift I possess. You put them together you can say the greatest gift I possess is life and life eternal and that is Christ and to God be the glory. Great things he has done. Brother Bram said this and this afternoon I want to speak on the greatest gift in the Bible. How many in the audience this afternoon could think of any greater gift than God would give to man eternal life? There is not one gift that could be given that's greater than life. It's sublime. It's a gift. And we can say Max Jesse, it's the greatest gift that I possess is life. It's a testimony, brother Jonathan, of what I believe is Jesus Christ. Sister Sarah, what's the greatest in your life is this one that's brought you together and given you a wonderful, wonderful gift from God. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. What a gift. The greatest gift he could give, salvation. The next greatest gift is a godly wife. The next gift is what they're cradling within their arms. I say God is great &gt;&gt; to the max, the greatest. &gt;&gt; But it's not just something they've put Jesse to it. I possess. It's a claim and it's a declaration. To God be the glory for the gift that I possess. May God's hand ever be on Max Jesse's life. And beside them, another trophy. We have brother Toby and sister Rebecca, parents also that have stood for the gospel and now they see their children standing here with another gift. I say there's power not only in the blood, there's power in the token, &gt;&gt; power to deliver, power to give love, power to give life, power to give a desire for the things of God. And if you ever spend any moments with brother Toby and sister Rebecca, you don't have to spend too much time in their living room and you realize that they have a love for the things of God. Joel, what a joy it is, brother Toby, to be given a gift such as your little daughter, Joel. Abeni. Joel. Jehovah is God. Abeni We prayed and God answered. &gt;&gt; What a time it is. &gt;&gt; They took time and Jesus blessed them. Lord, would you bless these children? We've got parents giving testimony of the greatest gift. And another Joel, God, you're God. Jehovah, your God. But I've prayed and you've answered. And if you want to take the time into Psalms where David cried out in Psalms 118 and5, Psalms 40 and1, Psalms 107 and13, Psalms 130 and2, 1st Samuel 23, and David inquired of the Lord again and God answered him. &gt;&gt; I say these are parents that have got a connection with God. &gt;&gt; They don't just send their children to church. They come as a family to church. May God bless these little ones this morning. Let's pray. Amen. Not too many years ago, I was doing this with Jonathan. I blessed man to be able to stand on here this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Love gifts &gt;&gt; given by God to special couples. They've sought your face. They've walked with God. You brought them together, Lord. You've led Jonathan and Sister Sarah. You blessed their parents. &gt;&gt; Now you blessed their home. &gt;&gt; I hold in my arms, Max, Jesse. Lord, &gt;&gt; pray God that you'll ever keep your divine presence upon this child. And may he live life to its fullest, to its maximum. Lord in Christ, this greatest gift that you are. Lord, may he have such joy. May he bring it to mommy and daddy's heart. Lord, may he learn of you at a tender and young age if you should terry. &gt;&gt; May father God, you bless this child in a special way. &gt;&gt; We dedicate him this morning to you saying, Lord, here's a gift you've given. We give back. We ask God now that your greatest blessing rest upon this child. As Jonathan's always had a song in his soul. Time should terry, you should terry. May also this little gift. Lord bless others with a song in his soul for the glory of God. We pray in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you John. God bless you. Aren't they darling? &gt;&gt; Yes, girls. Amen. Let's pray. Truly, Lord God, as a prophet has declared, Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new. What a testimony it is that a mother and father stand here this morning, Lord, wanting to dedicate their little daughter, their little gift back to you. And that's what we're doing. Father, I'm so thankful that they are parents that have communion with God. &gt;&gt; Lord, they've asked. Not only is it asked, but you have answered. &gt;&gt; You have blessed their lives. Bless it again, I pray. &gt;&gt; Let the glory of God rest upon this little child. I pray father God that the glory of your nearness will overshadow her. May Lord should bring joy again into the home. May oh God that she within her own life would be an expression of your grace. &gt;&gt; May Lord your hand &gt;&gt; a blessing be upon her is my prayer &gt;&gt; as we dedicate her back to you in the name of Jesus for your glory for your honor. Give wisdom to brother Toby. Give wisdom to Sister Rebecca. Grant to them favor, Lord, you. And I just pray now as this little family will leave this place. May your presence ever go before them in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Bless you. Amen. Thankful for God's blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just very thankful for the blessings of God. We're going to sing u song just as brother Biscll comes to bring the word. My hope is in the Lord. I stand in awe within the presence of the Lord. Let's sing it together as brother Ed comes. I stand in awe within the presence of the Lord. In whom the wisdom of the aes [Music] for whom the raing of the sea sides, [Music] the living sacrifice, [Music] the only source of life, my hope is Lord is [Music] And their mercies come with every rising sun. [Music] To be the sinner in his broken name to our heing and forgive. Oh, and those who tr will find their heart. Heat. Heat. Oh my go my [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just worship him. Thank him. &gt;&gt; How wonderful he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord Jesus. [Music] We praise your name Lord. We praise your name. [Music] &gt;&gt; How we thank you, Lord. How we thank you. Glory to your name, Lord. How wonderful he is. Isn't he worthy of all of our praise? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just let you have your seats for a few moments. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're really thankful for what God is doing. Amen. You've heard the announcement of our brother Junior Jeff uh passing early this morning and into the presence of God and uh we're we're happy for him. We're praying for his family. We have another uh testimony. We've been praying here at the church and others have been praying in in Europe and Switzerland and different places and uh I' I've heard from different places and on the map we've been praying for our brother Jean Jacques Michel in Switzerland and uh I just have a brief summary here. All I can tell you is that twice uh his family members have sent me word and also by telephone, by email that they actually walked into the hospital, walked into the room and watched watched with their physical eyes a miracle taking place in front of them. And uh that's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we shouldn't be surprised at those things. But uh 10 days ago, that was October the 17th, so it's less than 10 days. Brother Michel was rushed to the hospital unconscious. His heart rate was 250 beats and he had a a very high temperature, 39 plus, maybe over 40°, fever. The doctors diagnosed uh not only menitis, but it took them a couple of days after that to determine it was the most severe, worst kind of uh menitis that had attacked his brain. And so they placed him in in an induced coma. He was already unconscious, but they wanted to keep him because he was in very severe convulsions. After a couple of days, they tried to wake him, but his heart reacted negatively and they uh when they attempted to, he would enter into these severe convulsions from which he uh wouldn't recover. They didn't feel he would recover. So, the doctor said that his condition was terrible. That was their word. Uh they did an uh MRI which they call an IRM over there. They did a scan and they showed severe brain damage. They determined that 20% of his brain was uh destroyed. And uh they then they called the family to to be uh with him because they said that there was fluid around his brain and his brain was swelling and they had to take him off of the induced coma which they they said he would then go into these severe convulsions and they didn't expect that he could survive and they would be doing that within the hour. We received a phone call here to the office and I just gathered the brethren that were here. There was brother brother John Andes and brother Tom, brother Dier, brother Derek, brother Kim Dingwall was there as well. So we just gathered the brethren that were all there and we went to prayer and I just said whoever feels led to pray at this uh a very grave and serious moment let us uh enter into prayer and just pray as long as we felt we needed to. Uh they uh I I recall three times a statement was made in prayer, let the convulsion cease. Uh three specific times that was prayed. Let the convulsion cease. And uh the following morning the doctor came to the bedside and said, "Good morning, Mr. Michelo. whereupon brother Jean Jacques opened his eyes and the doctor they said almost fainted. Then his son Joel Joel arrived and whispered in his ear, "Hello dad, this is Joel." His dad opened his eyes and said, "Hello Joel." And from that from that moment he began to converse with the family. Now the doctors has said this that by Wednesday uh by this last Wednesday he was taken off a life support because he was completely on life support machine breathing for him. And by the time they took the indu took him out of the induced coma he began and off the breathing machine he began to breathe on his own. And by morning he was he was breathing 99% on his own and 1% with the machine. And so they took him off the machine completely. Uh and and then he began breathing naturally. When they took him off the induced coma they said that he remained in a natural coma and that is why in the morning when the doctor said good morning uh Mr. Michel and he opened his eyes. That's why there was such a surprise at that. And from that moment he began to converse with the family. He was hearing and moving around speaking even with a light sense of humor. The doctors said he would not be able to speak. He would not be able to uh uh have his uh have his senses back like that. And then then he sat for two hours in a wheelchair with no problem. On Friday, this last Friday, he was sitting, standing, eating well, and even asked for his laptop computer because he wanted to do something. And the doctors are calling him the miracle man. As reports have come in from the family, the emails have been shared and forwarded with others in need as an encouragement and witness of God's faithfulness and power. Just this morning, as I came to the study, I received the most recent, which my wife hasn't even been able to put down here. And we uh Brother Gerard and Sister Angela, and I believe that there's a group that are streaming the service right now. and members of brother Jeanjac's family and we want to greet them this morning and let them know that we join with them and we join with all the other people in the world that have been praying for him in Europe and Germany and Belgium and wherever and I believe that our brother and sister Iverson know them well and uh uh this I just got they received this phone call from the hospital that John Jocks has been taken out of emergency to a normal ward room and the doctors have made a complete neur neurological exams and found that everything is functioning perfectly. Now they're the same doctors. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. [Music] They are the same doctors in Geneva, Switzerland that said after an MRI that his brain was 20% destroyed. And they said that he would not have these functions. And the functions they said he would not have, he happens to have. And they said that they're functioning perfectly. And they just want to give God all the glory. Amen. So we give God all the glory. Amen. I feel that this morning we are here in his presence. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be in his presence? And it's so nice to have you, brother Hank, and Sister Iverson here. They're here for the wedding, of course, of their son, Simeon, who is brother Nathaniel's brother. And uh the wedding is taking place this uh next Saturday, November the 1st. Um, so we're happy to have them here and I believe they're going to be here for a time. So that's God bless them and God bless the wedding. Brother Simeon is marrying Sister Leah Barios and uh it's bittersweet. We are happy for him, but we're not happy that they have to go back to Belgium. But we'll keep strings attached and we're pretty good at that. Amen. Well, maybe you just stand with me and I'd like to just sing. Brother Rod of Wood, here we are in your presence just uh just to move into this uh preparation. You you were singing wonderfully and and I appreciate that so much. But let's just sing this as we move to read the word now. Here we are [Music] in your presence. [Music] Lifting holy hands to you, [Music] Lord. Here we are praising Jesus for the things he brought through. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the things he brought us through. [Music] &gt;&gt; Here we are. Let's lift our hearts up to him. &gt;&gt; In your presence, Lord, we're lifting holy hands to you. Here we are praising Jesus for the things he brought us through &gt;&gt; just with the prayer of thanksgiving. Dear father, we're so thankful because we serve a living God. You're the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, and of the prophets, father of our Lord Jesus Christ. You're the God of Elijah. You're the God of brother Brandham who came and with this mighty visitation. And we have had this visitation. You're the God of the bride of Jesus Christ. And so we worship you today in spirit and in truth. And we pray that truth will be imparted to us. that truth will be interpreted from your word into our very souls. We pray that you will give utterance, oh God, to myself as I stand here and this evening, Lord, in the service as brother Tom will minister. I pray that you will also give a a a reception, oh God, of receiving hearts, receptive hearts, minds, spiritual minds, oh God. And father, as a body of people, we take a firm stand against the enemy of our soul, against the enemy that would try to bind or hinder in any way. I ask that every need, Lord, within the walls of this building. You said to ask largely, so I ask that every need will be ministered to in Jesus Christ's name. And we rejoice in that victory. Amen and amen. Amen. God bless you. I'll have you turn in your Bibles please to Romans the 6th chapter and after we read three verses from 12-14 then uh keep your Bibles open. You may have your seats but we'll be turning then immediately to Judges. After Deuteronomy then comes Judges. Joshua Judges. All right, we'll read. Let not sin, and let's remember that sin is unbelief. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you that you should obey it in the lusts or desires thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. So, we see in this scripture right away that that we have a a part to play. Yield yield your members as instruments to God. That yielding is our part. That's something that we do. And then for sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sin shall not have or unbelief shall not have dominion. &gt;&gt; It shall not reign or control you &gt;&gt; because we're not under law but under grace. But we have a part in that we are to yield ourselves, our bodies are as instruments of God. And then sin will not have dominion over you. &gt;&gt; And that is quite simply when the word comes to us directly and speaks a certain thing, if we believe it and yield to it and act on that, sin will not have dominion over you. But if we hear it and resist it and you know just remain idle with it, then we come into bondage. &gt;&gt; All right, you may have your seats and if you'd please turn to Judges the 6th chapter and it'll take me a few moments in the service to tie these uh two thoughts together. But we're going to read about uh Gideon. And we all are familiar with Gideon. Uh it tells us in the first verse of Judges the 6th chapter and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Midian 7 years. Now when the scripture says and the and the children of Israel did evil, it always comes back to the one thing that they did not obey or believe the word. And so then they went into bondage. So it's exactly the same thing we read in Romans. If we yield, if we hear the word and yield ourselves, then uh then then sin shall not have dominion. They did not they heard but they did not follow through, did not believe, and they went into bondage. In this case, it was the Midian. Sometimes it was the Philistines for I think 40 years. Now they're in the hands of the Midians uh seven years and the hand of of Midian prevailed against Israel. And because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds. And so it was when Israel had sown that the Midianites came up and the Amalachites and the children of the east even they came up against them. And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou came unto Gaza, and left no substance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. For they came up with their cattle, and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude, for both they and their camels were without number, and they entered into the land to destroy it. And Israel, notice this please, was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord. Then it goes on to say that the Lord sent a prophet their way. And if we go down to verse 11, and there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak, which was in Ofra, and pertained unto Joash the Abrausite. And his son Kion thrashed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the Midianites. I wonder if that was legal by the Midianites law. I see her smiling. I don't think it was I think he was probably committing an illegal act. Otherwise, he wouldn't be hiding it, but he was hiding the wheat. That was uh by their law. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, verse 12, and said unto him, "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor." And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? And where be all the his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?" But now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midionites. And the Lord looked upon him and said, "Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midionites. Have not I sent thee?" And he said unto him, "Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am least in my father's house." And the Lord said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. And he said unto him, "If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me, depart not hence, I pray thee until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present." And and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until they'll come again. And Gideon went in and made a ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an epha of flour. The flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him unto the oak, and presented it. And the angel of God said unto him, "Take the flesh and unleaven cakes, and unleaven cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth." And he did so. Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And there arose up a fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight. And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord, a messenger of the Lord, you see, Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord God, for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face." And the Lord said unto him, "Peace be unto thee, fear not. Thou shalt not die." We'll cease our reading there. Now, the reason why I believe that God has has given this in such detail is brother Brandham said that the same angel of the Lord, the angel of the Lord here was like Elohim, the same one that met Abraham uh in the heat of the day. It's the same one. It's the angel of the Lord. And that's why he said that he the angel the God answered him and said you won't die because he thought that he would die having seen the angel of the Lord. Of course the reason why I believe that God uh uh made this such a profound experience in Gideon's life is for what Gideon had to do. And you know then he put the fleece before the Lord and uh you hear of Gideon's 300 and the a great victory which came about. But but I want to I I want to uh go back because I want to I need to make a uh I need to make a a comparison here between the gods of the Amalachites and the gods of the Midianites. And the Bible tells us that they that the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Midians uh for seven years. Now, where God delivered them into the hand of the Medidianites, I need to uh get your thoughts in this direction that that nation, one time it's the Philistines, another time it's Babylon, another time it's the Midianites. Every nation has a a a a system under which they operate. And part of part of uh this uh system I will say because I'm going to be using the word system a great deal is is their worship and their gods for they had gods and that's why God always told his people the children of Israel that you will not worship their gods and you will not intermar because it will lead you to their worshiping their gods and you'll destroy destroy their gods. You are not to submit to their gods because in submitting to their gods, they they became controlled. They came under control. And you're either going to be the conqueror or the conquered. They're either going to serve you or you're going to serve them. And so I I want to uh speak on this unbelief or sin. unbelief shall not have dominion over you. And I'd like to actually give it a second title and that is the gods of Leodysa. Because while we may not have little idols and gods that are set up around the country or we do not have groves where people go to worship, but we are not a nation and we're not a people and we're not a generation without idolatry. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely everywhere. And Satan has permeated this whole generation with idolatry. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham said, "You can make anything a god." He said, "You can make the piano a god. &gt;&gt; You can make your automobile, your possessions a god." A god is simply something that you do servitude to. &gt;&gt; You can make and we have many many systems. And I want to make a an I want to make a equate the gods of the heathens back in that day to the gods of the heathens in this day. &gt;&gt; Now, uh you people are alive and you rub shoulders and you go to work and you hear people speak. I said, and I'll repeat again, the heathens of this generation That's right. &gt;&gt; And we're not uh uh uh we're not living amongst a people that's free. They can speak about, you know, America being free. Uh the western people of the Western world being free. They can talk about a free market and all the rest of it. But we are not a people that are free. In fact, people today are in deep slavery. They're in deep bondage. They're in bondage to very very many things and perhaps many task masters that are actually controlling the people. And we as believers there are there are uh parts of this uh system because we are a part of a nation. We're part of a society. We're part of the civilization of this age. And there are elements within our national structure that we must have. Uh but we must have the spirit of discernment because we need to know where that boundary is whether it is serving us or we are serving it. &gt;&gt; So this is kind of where I'm going. We have a we have a uh we have an educational system. Now, Brother Brandham says on one hand, and I'm just way ahead of myself, but I I want to make sure I get there. Brother Brandham says on one hand, I'm not against education because we need an education, but he turn around on the other hand and say education's of the devil. So, so now you have we have science and we because we have science, we have certain inventions, we have our computers, we have the internet, we have automobiles out in the parking lot. Science has brought these things. We have different appliances in our homes and so on. Science and invention and mankind has developed these things and we wouldn't have them if we didn't feel that they were a benefit to us. But there's a there's a line that has to be drawn whereby we it serves us, serves our purpose, serves our needs or we start serving it. &gt;&gt; And I have I have personally witnessed where I have spoken and and counseledled with people who I knew were now beginning to serve the God of education. And that God took them away from my God &gt;&gt; and your God and they're not amongst us today because they began to serve another God. &gt;&gt; There are those that I believe a person can have a a light moment and can have some enjoyment, can have some R&R, and you can go and have some relaxation and some pleasure and and and enjoy some things. I don't think there's any any sin with knocking a a volleyball over a net, but there are those that have given themselves over to the God of pleasure. &gt;&gt; And I would say that a vast amount of our our living society today, people have given themselves over to pleasure and pleasureful things and they serve that God. And that God is not one twit different than the gods of the heathens of the Old Testament. It's the same kind of God. They may not have an idol, but they do have an idol. And you may say, "Now, Brother Brandham also said that the heathens did not believe that that idol was God. But they believe that that idol would speak to them. Their God would speak to them through that idol. In other words, they would have some uh communication. And they would have some um uh reciprocal thing happening. And I can tell you that people who have made education their god that god speaks to them through that idol. &gt;&gt; And they they will even say, you know, I'm benefited. I I I you know, I just do something. I I I I love this. When someone else loves pleasure, they give themselves to sports. literally give themselves give themselves to music &gt;&gt; and make music of God. &gt;&gt; You folks ought to be responding differently. &gt;&gt; They've made music of God and that God ministers to them. That God speaks to them through the idol that they have made in their in their mind. Business, money, the economic system. Don't tell me people don't serve it. They've served it with everything that's in them. And and and that God has turned around and stung them recently. &gt;&gt; And as the gods failed the heathens, this God has failed the heathens as well. &gt;&gt; And so it must be our servant &gt;&gt; or it will be our master. And so the scripture has said that we cannot serve two masters. &gt;&gt; We cannot serve two masters. We cannot serve God and mammon. Only one. We can only serve one. So there's a boundary between that being a servant or it being a master. And that's the delicate balance that I want to speak about today. And it probably won't be the same boundary in everybody's life, but you have to be in tune with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit has spoken to this generation through a vindicated prophet's mouth. And through that message, I say I can say to you unequivocally, you should be able to, if you're living in that realm of the spirit and not looking at the things which are seen because they're temporal. If you look at the things which are unseen, which are eternal, you God is is God is obliged and he is faithful to show you where that boundary is. &gt;&gt; And if we don't if we live on the side of it being our master, I just I'm getting I'm unloading this whole thing in just a few moments. But if we live on the on the side where be it the god of education, the god of pleasure, the god of business, the god of money, the economic system or any other system, if we live on that side of it where it is our master, it will lead you to death. &gt;&gt; Not to life, but to death. You'll begin to wither and dry spiritually and dry up and and it will keep you. What about what about even the system of time? Now I was uh wanting to do some research. I wanted to find out you know when how did we develop to this place where we are controlled by not by hours but by minutes. And the Bible says that God uh he created the lights in the heavens for days and for seasons and for time so that time would be kept. And so there were in years past I suppose I don't know what the first instrument was but I know that they had you know the sun dial and I know that people who don't have you know uh perhaps watches that run by seconds they you know they get up in the morning well because it's dawning it at dawn is coming a day is breaking. It's not that they are uh uh pounding the pavement at 6:00 in the morning to get to work at 7 and they and or they have to get into the office and punch that clock. They didn't know anything about that, but they knew that, you know, they gathered in the scripture at the hour of prayer. And I don't know exactly when it was, but I uh you know, and we're we're quite precise. We say we're starting service at 10:30. Sometimes it's 10:35, but generally around that time we're in service and there's one tonight at 5:00 and you'll look at your watch. But listen friends, not not because it's wrong. We need to I know you need to be at your place at a certain certain time, but this can be a very cruel master &gt;&gt; because it goes beyond just being at a certain place at a certain time. Our lives become completely regulated. And we and and and by beginning you find out when you start to serve that God &gt;&gt; that God if you serve it will leave you no time for your God. &gt;&gt; Is that so? &gt;&gt; Have you not all struggled &gt;&gt; trying to squeeze time out of the God of this age? &gt;&gt; Who developed it? Who who who who has cultivated and developed this civilization to this point to this fine-tuned where now it it you know it wasn't just a sun dial to tell you know that it was noon or midday or afternoon or whatever more. It hasn't done that, but it is it has got you down to seconds and and to hours and seconds and even, you know, 54 3 2 1 blastoff things are are just split seconds. So now I've got you kind of where I wanted you to to see where I want to equate the the the gods of the heathen nations to this present time that we're in. And then God through the leadership of the Holy Spirit should have absolute control of our lives. Now the scripture says, and I'm giving you some scripture which I just quoted from, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. the things which are seen, the things which are not seen. Uh you know, we're we're influenced by things that are seen. Let's face it, I want to be very very I want to be brutally honest today. We are very much controlled by the things which are seen. And your prophet, my prophet, God's prophet said that these little five senses that we live in, that's uh uh that's the way that's the way that God gave us in this world, this little world of our own. He said we were only given these so we could contact our earthly home but their senses beyond that another dimension. He went on to say in this building tonight well I will say this building this morning stands Jesus Christ. I made some statements like this in Ukraine and there was uh 4 or 500 people there. And when I said in this building is Jesus Christ in this building is angels. It was like a holy reverence just dropped on the whole congregation. and they accepted it &gt;&gt; and the and the atmosphere turned absolutely electric &gt;&gt; because they believed it. &gt;&gt; And it says in this building stands Jesus Christ in this building tonight is hosts of angels. Thousands of them gathered around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're a few hundred here, but there's thousands of them gathered around. &gt;&gt; I am accepting that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am believing that &gt;&gt; because it is that belief. It is that faith and the and the God who created all of those angels created them to be here &gt;&gt; and they're dispatched. Certain ones are dispatched here. Your angel is here. He says, "You don't see them, but you can feel the influence of them telling you that they're here." &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to sense and feel that influence. &gt;&gt; And a person doesn't have to have any physical feeling, but we have a feeling uh something within us that says and witnesses deep down, I believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I receive that &gt;&gt; and I wish and desire to be influenced by that unseen part of our uh of our worship and of our that God has provided for us. So I believe that we should strive to be directed by the things that are not seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I said earlier, we're either conquered or we're the conquerors. in God speaking to Mo through Moses the prophet of that day to them to the children of Israel. He said this to them and I'm reading this because I believe it's applicable to you that are here and to the people of this age. And the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath. I'm saying you should be the conqueror, the victor, and you shall not be beneath. &gt;&gt; You're not to succumb to the systems that uh deprive you of your spiritual life and walk with God. &gt;&gt; And I know that each one has their own struggle in this realm. I hope to be able to dwell on a little bit further. He said, "If if that thou if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord," I say, if you hearken to the voice of God that has been brought to us in a message, that message, the prophet said, the end time message meets the end time conditions. &gt;&gt; And remember, don't forget this, Satan has always from the very beginning desired to be worshiped. That's why he came to Jesus Christ, the son of man, in his physical state on earth and said, "If you'll fall down and worship me, I'll give you this." And he had he had the uh the the control of the earth at that time. But it says, "If you will hearken under the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day to observe and to do them, if you'll hearken to the commandments, you'll be the head and not the tail. If you hearken to the commandments, you'll be above and not beneath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll say, if you hearken to the commandments, then you will be the conqueror. &gt;&gt; If you hearken to the commandments, then all the gods of these other all the other nations, they will be your servants &gt;&gt; and they will and God will bring them to your benefit rather than to master be master over you. &gt;&gt; So, we cannot serve two masters. However, you can serve one master and he will instruct you by the Holy Spirit how to serve the other. Be it an employer, be it your business, be it your uh further education or whatever it is. Now, just because these things are right down to the grassroots of your life and my life, it doesn't mean that it's not deep spiritually. Well, what is difficult is to take something and there's I I've got pages of quotes here that I want you to be able to hear to let you know that God had the spirit of Elijah speak these things in a very definitive way because it's important to us. &gt;&gt; It's essential to us. No man can serve two masters, our Lord Jesus said. For either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon. &gt;&gt; So there's nothing wrong with saying I I am I am using uh because God even said if you'll obey my commandments, these nations will serve you. Right. &gt;&gt; He said even they'll be tributaries to you. &gt;&gt; They'll serve you. &gt;&gt; I believe that the whole economic system should serve you. &gt;&gt; I said it should serve you. &gt;&gt; You should not become the servant &gt;&gt; of the economic system. Whether it comes on a piece of paper or whether it comes on a plastic card called a a a Visa, Mastercard or whatever more. I believe it's wrong to become servant to it. &gt;&gt; Use it, but don't serve it. &gt;&gt; Where's that line? Will you let the Holy Spirit tell you where that line is? But I believe that it's wrong to become a a a servant to it. And so we need to uh we need to have this uh discernment. Now in Ephesians, Apostle Paul has said, "Servants, be obedient to them." Now, this just goes to show you now, "Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto Christ." as unto Christ. I'm so glad. But if they if they told you, and I have I'm looking down in a congregation. I have people who have had uh who have had good occupations but their employer has said when you come to a certain station where you need to report I want you to report falsely &gt;&gt; that's a believer &gt;&gt; I want you to report falsely I want you to report report false weight I want you to tell them a lie so what what's a believer do he has to be master over that &gt;&gt; that master says as as Christ well Christ isn't going to require you to serve booze &gt;&gt; he's not going to require you to do a bunch of ungodly things he's not going to require you to lie and be untruthful and that's where a person needs to he's not going to require you and he's not going to deprive you listen closely he's not going to deprive you of the very spiritual fellowship that you need. &gt;&gt; You need spiritual fellowship. And if my employer said, "Well, you can't uh you know, you you have to work this Wednesday and you have to work every weekend." That that that would be the end of my conversation. &gt;&gt; That'd be the end of my conversation right there. I said, "Well, you know, I may have to miss a service or I may have to miss, you know, because of a a certain schedule, but I will not let this God &gt;&gt; deprive me and deprive my God of worship &gt;&gt; because I want to come and I want to worship with the household of faith. I need to worship and that God is not going to dictate my life to me. &gt;&gt; You're going to serve me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Serve my purpose. Serve my ends. And you know what? God will honor that. &gt;&gt; God will honor that. &gt;&gt; Well, I I I need to because of of the finances. Now, we've gone to another god. &gt;&gt; See, so we have all of these gods of Leodysia, of this age, in this generation. But Apostle Paul tells us to serve our masters, to serve them with fear and trembling and singleness of heart, not with eye service as men pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, with good will, doing service as to the Lord, and not to man, knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. So it says as we do that and we serve we serve our our earthly master with singleness of heart with fear and trembling and reverence etc. which is foreign to this is foreign language to this day. &gt;&gt; People serve their employer and and and with disrespect and curse them out and try to slough off on their job and all the rest of it. Listen, what Apostle Paul is teaching is that when we serve them according to the word, we don't get a reward from him. You might get a paycheck or something on your uh IRA or whatever, but we we we get it from God. God's the one who rewards us. &gt;&gt; He can make your money go further. &gt;&gt; He does all the time. &gt;&gt; He can prosper your field, &gt;&gt; prosper your home. &gt;&gt; He can just turn things like that Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People who say, "I can't afford to tithe." You can't afford not to tithe. &gt;&gt; You can't afford not to tithe to begin with. It's not your money. &gt;&gt; It's God's money. &gt;&gt; And what what country in the world has has had their taxes at 10% for 4,000 years? &gt;&gt; It's only It's been 10% since the beginning. Every country raises their taxes, raises their taxes, but but this economy has been the same. &gt;&gt; God's continued to operate everything with his tithing and 10% and then offerings if you feel to do so, knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. And you masters now some of your employers do the same things unto them forbearing uh uh and and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing uh forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven is in heaven neither is their respect of persons with him now there are some systems in the world and I don't want to spend any time on this but some of the ones that are are so very prominent. You know, communism was a big thing some few years ago, but but it's actually based on a system and the system is an economic system uh in which the means of production are distributed uh to the open competing uh profit. That's capitalism rather and and the seeking seeking of a free market. And communism is a system that's been put forward. These are some words that I've just chosen by revolutionary thinkers such as Lenon and Marx and and these kind of people and uh and and it is believed they believed it was necessary to absolutely abolish private uh property and thus doing away with the ruling class and turning everything over to uh uh to to the people to the workers. That was their whole scheme. And it's great in theory, but it didn't work because actually, you know, these are my words once again, but I think that communism as it as it's been demonstrated in the world is the highest form of capitalism because it actually took took the ownership from the people and let just a very very small ruling class live like kings. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They're the ones they're the ones. I I spoke with a brother who was a minister over just when communism was falling and he actually kind of wanted it to come back because his apartment cost $160 US a month. They paid everything. But the same brother couldn't go and find any meat. Could hardly find anything to buy. Didn't have money to buy it anyway. And I gave them I gave them a little box of food and gave them $50 US. Went a $160 US. So we paid for their room for a long period of time. But when I gave them $50, they just broke into open sobbing. They didn't even imagine that kind of money in their hands. And and and and so did communism provide the actual working class? No. Nothing. But were they serving that system? Absolutely. They'd serve it and even wanted it to come back. And these are people who were you know um Christians as such. So these are controlling systems and within the framework of every nation and we have we have all kinds of controlling systems here. You you might say do do you live by it? Yeah, you do. They tell the system tells you. &gt;&gt; The system tells you how much tax you're going to pay. &gt;&gt; To keep the system going to come down and control you. &gt;&gt; This is not a philosophy. This is actual fact. So the system tells you how much tax you'll pay. You don't tell it. You don't go to the cash register in a store at Walmart or wherever and say, "I refuse to pay that tax." No, they tell you what to pay. They tell you how much to pay. The the the system within your state or your county or your city tells you what you'll pay &gt;&gt; on your house tax. &gt;&gt; It's control. &gt;&gt; They'll tell you, the medical system will tell you what you're going to pay. And this is not just this is not just having to do with money and economics. This is having to do with your health, having to do with your food. &gt;&gt; Who here had any control of inflation? You don't have any control of inflation. It controls you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we do service to it. &gt;&gt; Because in paying it, we keep it going. You pay for your protection. &gt;&gt; You pay for your police force or policemen who are here in the church. You have nothing to say about how much you pay for them. It is paid. They determine whether you will, you know, what you pay on your fire and what you pay on everything else. It's all controlled &gt;&gt; and you work daily to serve that. You're in servitude to it. But there is a line in all of these things. It's very very complex. I have a lot to say about it, but it's very very complex. And and we have to be very very certain that when we have uh something of the Holy Spirit that begins to speak to us and say, you know, thus far, no further. &gt;&gt; Amen. that that's where we draw the line. So just listen now. I want to make this relevant into today's scene. in the beginning when Satan came and used the serpent now because I've talked about a number of systems etc etc but now we'll talk about the system of religion so we do not want the message to become to be a system &gt;&gt; this is under the direction of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and Many people come into the message and they've come out of a religious system. So they expect the message to operate in the same manner. Well, the church I was in, they looked after my children in a daycare and they counseledled with I had every little thing to do and they did this and they helped me there and when I didn't have food, they delivered food to me. It it's a system, but that may not be God's system. God's system might be you get out and you work with your hands and you do what is necessary and you trust him. &gt;&gt; But in the beginning, Satan's cunning tactic becomes clear from the very very beginning. And don't forget the one that was in the garden is the one that has developed this system. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's it. &gt;&gt; Yay. Hath God said, "You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" So now he's coming and saying, "Is the word of God, God's order, and God's system of life, is it holding you back, depriving you of your real potentials? Hath God said, "You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" In other words, he says exactly the same thing today. And and the serpent said to the woman, uh, you shall not surely die because that that whole thing come. I'm talking now from experience. I've talked to lots of people and they have felt that somehow I'm talking now about the message because to me that's God's system. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they begin to feel that the restraints of the message is holding them back from getting where they could really get to. Uh I don't know if the young lady is here, but she had and if she's here, she won't mind, I'm sure, but she had separated herself from the faith of the believers. had separated herself from the fellowship of the believers and and I saw God speaking to her and I went to her and spoke with her and she was separating herself be just for one small thing. She has a desire. So now Satan has taken a hold of the desire and her desire became a god. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And she wanted now and that that's that can be in anybody's place. &gt;&gt; And she she just has a desire a a love for she said I want to be a hairdresser and I know that I can't cut hair if I remain a believer. I know that I can't cut a lady's hair and that one little thing. But Satan was feeding that desire. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now, that may not mean a whole lot to some people, but to me as a pastor, it was that girl's soul. &gt;&gt; And that happens to be very, very important, &gt;&gt; a girl's soul. And Satan was using and anointing that desire until it loomed so big. She's prepared to give up the songs that you and I sing. Prepared to give up the the whole atmosphere of the Holy Spirit, the angels. Prepared to give up. Maybe you sit here, you don't even know until I quote, maybe some of you young people don't even know the thing that you feel and that you sense and you wonder what it is. You know it's not the person sitting next to you. You need a prophet's message to tell you you're you're actually sensing angels, but you don't know it. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the very spirit of God, the creator of heavens and earth comes into a place like this and maybe people are to completely unaware of it. But God, but Satan will raise up something in a person's in a person's life or in their desires or in their who knows amongst their friends, amongst their associates, whatever more and it just starts drawing them Where is it drawing? And who is it that's drawing? And what is it? That thing, whatever it is, becomes a god. &gt;&gt; And it is drawing you to bondage &gt;&gt; and to death. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it does. And so he he he says the serpent said to the woman, "You shall not surely die." He came right to the point. He said, "This isn't going to cost you death. The thing that God is withholding from you certainly won't bring any harm or death for you. Huh? For God knows that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." And now notice this. And the woman uh and and the woman saw the tree that was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired. That tree is still here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The tree of good and knowledge is still present. It won't be here in the future. The tree of life is here as well. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said you're every man, every woman makes the same decision. Now, it's not back on Adam and Eve. It's on us. &gt;&gt; We make the same decision. And uh and and and so she this was this was the tactic. And many things appear like he made it to appear that day. Make them to appear necessary. Make them to appear pleasant. Now, I'm not here to draw any lines. I'm here to expose the things so that you can draw the line. So the Holy Spirit can speak to you and draw the line &gt;&gt; in in Christ is the mystery. Uh brother Brand used this. He spoke these words. Why do you hunger? I just like to stop there. Why do you hunger, church? Why do you hunger? Why do you thirst? Said it's the father trying to reveal his hidden secret to you. &gt;&gt; And then he put it this way. But you let so many things get it out of you to get the hunger out, to get the thirst out. So many things. You let your job, you let your wife. And I'll say something to wives right here. Don't keep your husband so busy that they don't have time for God. You let your husband Husbands, don't keep the wives in a place where they don't have a quiet time, a quality time with God. Everything else, you know, all the things that we agitate and move around in our daily life. And I know you're quiet and I know what I'm saying. I need to say. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan in this age, in this generation, do you know that people just recently in fact is this whole economic meltdown? They talk about an economic meltdown. Do you know that people sold their souls to get to where they are financially to only have it absolutely evaporate in a matter of days? Do you know that a couple days ago, first thing in the morning, I haven't even heard news for a long time, but but in Europe, it wasn't it wasn't headlines. It was entire sections of the international papers, the papers from London and the and the Herald Tribune from Paris and other give entire sections of the newspaper. Europe was melting down because of what was taking place in the United States and people's earnings they've been saving. They've been paying into their into their retirement funds and the retirement funds are just disappearing overnight. It might get to the place and might be there now where you and I are learning we have to depend on God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our God is your best retirement. &gt;&gt; As of last night, the national debt of uh of United States and we don't have one for Canada that I could that I spend any time to find because it would be infatismal compared to America. But America the great dynamic powerhouse Now, God knows what he's doing. God knew why he had a prophet raised up out of that nation because that is the remaining superpower of the earth. And they are the dynamic. They're the dynamics of the economic system of the world. There were at as of last night there's 10 trillion 500 and some billion debt and uh brother Rod I don't know if he's still here he sent me a letter and I haven't read the whole letter but there was a a man who has written called the Dao letter for the last 50 years and he has been exceedingly accurate it with his writing. He has predicted when markets were going down. He's predicted not minutes, days. He's not into that. He's into the whole general scenario whether things are good times are coming or difficult times are coming. And I understand he's never missed. And he said that America something in this order. America has always been able to print themselves out of these crises because all other nations can't afford to lose them because they're the they're the dynamic behind the they they consume a tremendous amount. They buy a tremendous amount and and these other countries need to need to uh sell and export to America. They said something on this order and I may not have it completely correct but he said and I I just know a wee bit about this but he he related to the gold standard and brother Brandham spoke about the gold standard. He said that United States is the only nation, the only nation that has refused to acknowledge the free the free uh the free market value of gold. They have held it at the $35 an ounce. As far as themselves as a as a nation is concerned, they've held it at $35 an ounce. I was in Toronto when President de Gaulle of France required that America pay and take all their paper money and pay them pay France in gold. And that is when gold left all other nations. That is when it left the $35 an ounce and began to start. And when it went to about like 70, 75, and 80, you know, it was tripling its value. It was just shaking and there was a there was a a a real loud voice within the Senate and and because it amounted to about 40 to 45 billion that America had to provide in gold and buy the paper back and the and there was an uproar in the Senate of United States government because they said they still owe us, France still owes us the war debt and the war debt is about exactly the same amount. And so just let it be a wash and just tell President de Gaul, we'll just take that for your war debt. We're not paying you back in gold. But America being the good neighbor that they are and the generous people that they are paid and took their money back and gave them gold. and gold then went completely off the off the radar and has been going up and down ever since. But this gentleman says, and I'm spending more time with this than I had anticipated, but just give me a few moments. This gentleman says who writes the Dow letter. He says, "America has never acknowledged that gold is off of the $35 an ounce." So, because they are the powerhouse, if they should say, for example, all right, we'll unhinge it. We'll okay, it's going to be free, then we'll say it. We're the ones we'll say it it's loosed from the $35 an ounce. And this man said, "How would you like $30,000 an ounce?" Because by if they have to pay in gold, they let it go screaming up to some absurd figure which will reduce their debt from trillion, 10 trillion maybe down to just a quarter of that or less and let it go screaming up there. Now, brother Brandham said some very very specific things about the gold market and the gold standard. And he he even he even went as far as to say the one thing that Castro did which was right was change the order of the money. Change it and print new money. And I happen to have been now through several nations that have reprinted their money and changed their money and and and you people from Europe, you know a little bit more about that. But suddenly things that brother Brandham has said about the gold standard and where the gold is and he says Rome said in one place specifically he may have said they own it but he says in one place Rome controls &gt;&gt; the gold of the world. South America was in se severe debt crisis not very long ago. Pope John Paul and I saw it on the television. I don't know where I was, but I saw him on the television and he walked in to the United Nations, the United Nations of all the world, and he chastised them. Now, here's a man that hasn't got tanks, hasn't got missiles, doesn't have an army, but has more power &gt;&gt; than all those nations put together. And he exercised that power because because South America, Brazil, and Venezuela, and some of those countries owed the US banks and Canadian banks and European banks hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. The Pope stood on their behalf. Why? Because they're Catholic. and he chastised the other nations and essentially commanded them to forgive that debt. And the Canadian government, the Canadian banks forgave hundreds of millions of dollars of debt. And he's the one who called for it because do they not have gold? Yeah, they have gold. But he had he exercised his power to forgive those debts. You see friends, don't don't don't f don't mistake me when that prophet says they control the gold. That's exactly what it means. &gt;&gt; They control and I'm saying they're controlling systems &gt;&gt; which you and I we need. He says one place now you may think that I'm I'm really off base here. says one place in the beginning they didn't have to wear clothes but we have to wear clothes. See in other words we have to we have to be modest but we don't have to serve the god of fashion. &gt;&gt; We don't have to have every latest color &gt;&gt; and every latest style. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you get on that treadmill, you're simply bowing to a God of this age. &gt;&gt; Says on the one hand, I'm not against education because you need an education. How far you go in the education, that's strictly between you and God. &gt;&gt; We haven't got anything here. It says you got to drop out at 8 or no, you have to go to 12 or you need your diploma. Oh, no, you need to go and have further education, whatever more. I'm happy for everyone here that has got the education that they have got. But don't forget that it is a God. &gt;&gt; And this little man that stands here before you has has I I've agonized because I saw that God begin to tell that person what they could do spiritually and what they couldn't do spiritually. And they're gone. &gt;&gt; They're gone. And you know what that God brought them? Death. death, &gt;&gt; a spiritual death. You might say, "Well, what were they predestinated to?" I don't know what what what God's order predestination is. But I know one thing that we are to exhort. We're to admonish. We are to preach. And I can tell you that the word and the message which we have received has the answer &gt;&gt; for every end time condition. And I don't care what condition you're in today, whether you're employed, unemployed, whether you're rich, whether you're poor, whether you have enough, or you have nothing, or you're way below the uh where you're in a crisis, a financial crisis, or whatever. All I can tell you is that Satan operates in every one of those systems. And we are called on to not to serve them, &gt;&gt; to use them, &gt;&gt; but not to serve them. going to take a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; He says this, I talk about the system of religion just now for a moment. He says the false church groups come together. Now, the reason why I'm going to read quite a bit and I want you to follow it very closely. Follow it very closely because you'll it tie together how that this whole economic thing really it really is part of a religious system. We talk about Rome. Rome is not merely an economic system. It's a religious system. Do you see how powerful that God is? Amen. &gt;&gt; You talk about the God of the Medidianites and the God of the Am Amalachites and all these other god of the Jebusites and everything else. They have nothing on this generation. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe they controlled 10,000 people or a 100,000 people. We're talking about a a man in a system that controls literally controls directly over a billion people, but indirectly actually he'll control the earth. That's right. &gt;&gt; The false church groups will come together in a world council of churches. They have this world council of churches is the image erected to the beast. So now you know that I know that you've read that before. Now remember it is imperial pagan Rome that fell by the sword. But she was healed of her death stroke when she joined in the nominal church, Christian church of Rome and incorporated paganism and Christianity. She's the one that has done it. Satan through the instrumentality of that system, that's a system united those two together, paganism and Christianity, and thereby became the Holy Roman Empire. He said, "This may seem far-fetched." He said, "I'll just I'm trying to hurry here. Have to forgive me." He said, "Which was to endure until Jesus came and destroyed her, but Rome is not going it alone. Her daughters are right with her, and she will take over absolute authority by the World Council of Churches." This may seem far-fetched to some, but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling the politics. &gt;&gt; So churches are controlling the politics. &gt;&gt; You accept that? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So politics is actually serving to the churches and at the opportune time we'll manifest exactly how great that that is that control. This ecumenical move will end up with Rome at the head. &gt;&gt; Even though the people did not envision it that way. &gt;&gt; Hey, I I know all kinds of people I've talked to. They never envisioned that they'd be swept into that. the ecumenical thing would be swept into Rome. If they would have read the church age book, they would have seen it way back 40 years ago. &gt;&gt; Even though the people did not envision it that way. This is so because in Revelation 17:3-6, it states that the horror mystery Babylon is seated on the beast and she is controlling she is controlling the last or fourth empire. And this Roman church is doing that with the world church system. World church system under uh world church system under her. Rome will be controlling and this image church system will be the will be obedient to Rome because Rome controls the gold of the world. &gt;&gt; She controls the gold of the world. So now the whole uh church system, well how does that affect us as believers? Well, maybe in some minor way at this point, but if you just go across this audience right here and all who are streaming and everything else and tally up the weight and burden that you go through economically speaking, you can thank Rome for most of it. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; You'll say, "Well, you know, I I just have a I I just have a Bank of America card. I just have this or I'm just paying this mortgage." But way beyond the realm of your vision &gt;&gt; is a is a a a power &gt;&gt; who's controlling and manipulating and doing these things. And you're just down here. We're just surfs. &gt;&gt; That's right. We're just little people down here at the end of the line and we're just working for our paycheck. Whatever more you, that's what I'm saying today. You don't have any control over the economics. You don't have any control over the taxes. You don't have any control over what's taken off here. In fact, is all we are here. We're we're just in in servitude in a sense. So that is why we need the Holy Spirit to direct us because as far as the world is concerned, they can just cause that to evaporate in a few moments. or a few days. I think two three days ago, the first thing on the news is that the stock market in the United States and in Canada was in a complete free fall and they were going to issue and stop the trading. I never heard of that in America. Never heard of that in in in Canada that that these countries part of the G8 system that system big trading system they're going to stop because uh the whole bottom had fell out of our economy. Iceland as a nation was going to declare bankruptcy as a whole nation. You know friends, like brother Brandham said to this man that tried to give him one and a half million. My wife and I were talking about it today over the breakfast table. Tried to give brother Brandham a million and a half dollars. Brother Brandham told me in detail himself how the two men came to his door and they said, "Do you know Mr. So and so?" And he said, "Yes, I do." said, 'I believe his wife was healed from cancer. They said, ' That's correct. In California. They said, 'Well, we're here because we have to Can you identify who you are? And at first, he thought, is something wrong? Is something wrong with Billy Paul? Is something happened? No. Said nothing's happened. Nothing's wrong. We just need to ensure ourselves that we're talking to the right person. So, he said, "Well, I have my minister card or whatever." They said, "They'll be fine." And so he identified himself and he said he said, "But what what's wrong?" No, they said, "We're here just to uh we're here to see first that we have the right person and then to u notify you that you've been given a million half dollars." Oh, he said, "I I wouldn't even know what to do with a million half dollars." He said, "It would just drive me crazy. I wouldn't know what to do with that. Million half back then is probably 15 million today." They said, "I wouldn't know what to do with a million and a half." No. They said, "Uh, they said it's already in your account. It's already we just have a letter saying that, you know, we have to notify you. You can go to the bank and and do whatever you want to do." And he sent them back. He said, "Go back." And thank the man very much, but he says, "I cannot accept it." He said in another little thing that we were reading this morning, his brother Howard said, "Take it. you should receive that check. The man wanted to give him this check and he he told this man or the man told him he said when they were talking about this million and a half dollars. He said, "You see those mountains way over there?" Brother Bam said, "Yeah." He said, "Do you know how far that is?" He said, "No, sir, I don't." He said, "That's 80 miles." He said, "And over those mountains I own grazing land for my cattle up to those mountains and over those mountains and on the other side." And Brother Brandham looked at that and he said, "Well, you know, that's a lot." He said, "Is it looking that way?" And then he looked up. He said, "How much do you have up there?" &gt;&gt; And he admitted himself. He didn't know if he had anything up there. He said, "I have a I have a mansion up there. &gt;&gt; That is my home up there. &gt;&gt; That's where my treasure is up there." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just give me a couple more minutes and then I'm going to close. He says, "With great power the church systems will persecute the true bride." You know sometimes little things if if I just tell you it doesn't mean anything to maybe very much to us but it might have caused someone else a whole lot of agony and a great deal of consternation. Sister Leah Barios had a place all picked for their wedding and you know the strain of a wedding and everything else and they're unable to have it here because brother Simeon can't come across the border just at this time. So they're having it down there. Nazarene church. Nice Nazarene people. Brother Tony just preached for in a Nazarene church over there and they're done with him also. this Naz Nazarene church. They agreed to it and the wedding's going to take place, but they go on the website and find our church and Bible way Bible believers and notified her. No, they can't have the wedding there because of who we are. Do you know one of our young ladies was walking with a couple other ladies in a big mall down in Burnaby. Now, you see, I'm going way back from thousands or a couple thousand years, but right to today. They're walking this last week and they're going to have something to eat and they decide, well, they go to a restaurant, no, and they looked another restaurant. No, and they they looked at this one. No. And then they went back and finally decided, well, they'll go to this one. So they go in and the only place o open, you know, a couple men sitting over here and and so they sat here and and had something to eat. They got up to leave and just as they were going by, one man says, "Clanam." And this sister, you don't hardly get very many words out of her. She turned right around and put her hands on the table and she said, "Not clan Christian. Well, oh well, you know, they didn't want to be abusive, but they said, "Well, well, but but it is a clan." No, he said, she said, "It's not a clan. It's Christian." And she was very adamant and bearing down on him. It's Christian. Then they began to, you know, backpedal. Well, you know, then one fell says, "Well, you know," he says, uh, well, I'm a Jew, but I'm not a very good one. And this fellow one the other guy says Chillowak. She said no. Abbottzford. She said no. Cloverdale. He says Brham. She said yeah. What's wrong? What's wrong with having a prophet? &gt;&gt; And this guy says, well actually he says I've been to your church. Oh, you have? Yeah. He says, "My parents are good friends of Brother Burkheart and Sister Doris." He says, "And I came in church and sat." Do you know who it is? I I came in your church and I sat beside them. So he knew. Do you think that was an accident? There's a clan. God bless our sister. &gt;&gt; Karen Ashdown says, "No, not a clan. Christians, I say the Holy Ghost came on top of her." And give those two men something to answer to on the other side. So what is the door closed? Yeah, door was closed. Slam and slammed shut in the last 2 three days to our sister send her scrambling to find another place. And this message today might might cause this door to be slammed. Whatever it is, whatever it takes, &gt;&gt; it's still the truth. &gt;&gt; And then I'm going to close with this. in the this is still in the Philadelphia church age said before the antichrist in person takes over. He said with this great power the church system will persecute the true bride and this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching. Her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it. I have been kept out of the prison. I cannot be part of the visiting people at the hospitals because it has to be someone who's part of the ecumenical system &gt;&gt; that's already that's been in place for a long time. &gt;&gt; Do you know you say, "Well, I wasn't aware of that." You're not aware of a lot of things. &gt;&gt; Do you know why? You're under the protection of the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are under the protection of the Holy Spirit. If we had to be subjected to, you know, if if the Holy Spirit pulled back his protection, you'd find there would be real severe God has protected you. &gt;&gt; He's protected us. He said before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches, the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord. God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the lamb. &gt;&gt; That's where my home is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He went on to say, he says, I will keep thee. He quotes the scripture. And I'm just closing right now in a couple minutes. I will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth. That's scripture revelation. He said this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go into and through the tribulation. If it meant that, it would have said that. But it said, I will keep thee from &gt;&gt; the hour of temptation. Hallelujah. This temptation is exactly like the temptation in Eden. &gt;&gt; That's why I read it. This temptation is exactly like the temptation in Eden. And the temptation was is is this holding you back? You can't earn what you you can't fellowship with who you want to. You don't have the kind of friends. You don't have the kind of you don't have the kind of enjoyment. You're you're held back. You're restricted. You can't really, you know, to some of some of women, and this is common, you got talents that that are you're being held back from, and you need to be able to have that freedom. It's a trap. &gt;&gt; Excuse me for getting, &gt;&gt; but it is a trap &gt;&gt; to throw yourself out into the into the marketplace, as it were. Oh, God, help us &gt;&gt; to keep you from the hour of temptation. He said the same one that was in Eden. He says, "And it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's commanded word. And yet from the standpoint of human reasoning, it will be so very right, so enlightening and lifegiving as to fool the world. Only the very elect will not be fooled. &gt;&gt; The temptation will come as follows." Isn't this amazing? This is more up to-date than tomorrow morning's newspaper. &gt;&gt; God through his prophet knew exactly what was going to happen to the whole economic system, the whole all the subtilities of Satan in this world. And it doesn't matter whether you're a young fellow sitting here on the front seat, young ladies or or or families or whatever more or aged. It's all the same. Only the elect will not be fooled. And the temptation will come as follows. The ecumenical move. See how the temptation will come as follows. He ties it right to the church, &gt;&gt; the church system. The ecumenical move that has that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all might be one becomes so strong politically &gt;&gt; that she bears pressure upon the government to cause listen it's very close to cause the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles in acted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of the council. &gt;&gt; So we say well this church is over here and church is over there and all these various churches the masters of those churches want mastery and control of the entire system. So as I can tell you friends, it it becomes so subtle and they have enacted enacted laws that are in direct violation to the message. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to say to you, who are you going to bow to? &gt;&gt; Who is going to be your God? Amen. &gt;&gt; My God is God. &gt;&gt; My God is a living God. &gt;&gt; And I will not bow to a system or some other order that is going to control my life and tell me how I will serve God or how I will worship or who I can fellowship with or who I can't fellowship with. Our God has already informed us and we're well informed. Excuse me for taking as much time as I have today. But I this is the hunger that I have in my heart. Why do you hunger? &gt;&gt; Why do you thirst? &gt;&gt; It's because the father &gt;&gt; is trying to reveal himself to you. &gt;&gt; Don't serve all these other gods. And there's a multitude of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know you're listening to me. I know some some of you may be having a hard time accepting or acknowledging it. Listen, just believe it. &gt;&gt; Just believe it. And a year down the road, if it doesn't work for you, well then you can come and call me a nasty person. But I can tell you one thing. What that messenger wrote was for us today. &gt;&gt; What God spoke through him 40 years ago, 45 years ago, is for us right now at this time. Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your kind attention. Let's just bow our heads in prayer. Father, we have been so instructed, so informed, and you have pricricked our hearts. We know these words are true. And now I'm asking oh Lord that you will take the words that have been spoken and let them let it be a light upon the path and upon the way. I pray that you will guide oh God the thoughts and the decisions of the people. You will guide them. Give them the discernment discerning of spirits. Lord I pray that they will have such a keen discernment. Let them know, Father, what what what we shall do day by day. And as your messenger has said, we just have a light upon perhaps the next footstep, but you're the one that guides us. And we're so thankful for it. Lord, I ask you to your blessings upon this congregation of people and all that are uh streaming, whatever country, whatever part of the world, whatever time of the day it is. I ask oh father that you will enter the room where they are oh God and let your presence father and let your presence be our portion in Jesus Christ's name and whatever need lord there may be some that are facing great and critical decisions at this time some things that are coming up in their in their immediate future I pray that you will help them father help them in the name of Jesus Christ someone may be in troubled waters I pray you'll still waters for them, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Someone may be suffering physically. I pray that you will heal them for healing as part of our redemptive the redemption price at Calvary. Thank you, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll have you stand with me and I want to I want to uh sing uh I will praise him. I just had that in my heart since the before the service. It's 6:05 and [Music] I saw I saw the cleansing fountain. [Music] Open wide for all my sins. I obey the spirit. When he said will come, let's give him what he's worthy of. I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners slain him. Glory for his blood. &gt;&gt; Notice these words. How the way seems straight and narrow. [Music] Oh, my clay was swept away.

I will praise him. Praise the lamb for our king. Glory all the people. For his blood has washed away each s. And before we sing the fourth verse, I'm going to ask our brother Moan if you'll come down and offer prayer to the people or brother Moan and ask God's Holy Spirit to make these words locked in your memory. And I'm praying that God, I need direction. I need guidance every day. You all can pray for me. If you don't have anyone to pray for, pray for me. We just need that direction. But I know as time goes on, you talk about the squeeze, that's what you're experiencing. That's what you will experience. More of a squeeze. More of a squeeze. That's the whole design. But the prophet said it way ahead of time. So don't get don't get discouraged when you're in the middle of it. It will happen. That's the way it is ordained. But the God that I serve &gt;&gt; is greater &gt;&gt; than any God. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; And he has made you the head &gt;&gt; and not the tail. &gt;&gt; You'll not go hungry. &gt;&gt; You'll not go hungry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Never saw God's children baking bread. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; You'll have enough and more. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He'll guide you. &gt;&gt; He knows the future. Young man, young ladies, he knows your future. He'll open doors where they never thought there was a door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can drop food on the plate from heaven. We want to please him. [Music] &gt;&gt; When you're sick, &gt;&gt; he's our father. [Music] &gt;&gt; I've enjoyed wonderful health. Wonderful health. And I never found that I had to beg him for it. &gt;&gt; Just received it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And thank him for it. That's what you want to do. &gt;&gt; All right, the last verse. We'll sing it. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful name. &gt;&gt; So glad he took me. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? He took us in. Oh, he forgiven all my friends. [Music] He has cleansed my heart from &gt;&gt; Oh, we have so much to thank him for. Oh, I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the Lamb. [Music] has washed away. [Music] &gt;&gt; Shall we pray? Aba Father, my God, &gt;&gt; my Lord, we heard your son praying, Father. We saw how we personalized his relationship with the father &gt;&gt; and he said, "My Lord and my God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Father, we have been placed in that position today. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where we could relate to you as your children. &gt;&gt; We can relate to you as sons and daughters of God whom you have washed with your blood whom you have bought a second time from the pawn shop. Whom you have redeemed &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; With the price of your own blood. &gt;&gt; What it cost you, Father, to redeem these children today. &gt;&gt; We stand in your presence, Lord. Once again, we thank you for the words that have been spoken from this pulpit. &gt;&gt; We thank you for the message that has gone forth throughout the earth today from here. Father, we thank you that you have been amongst us. Your presence is with us. &gt;&gt; Regardless of the times that we are living in, &gt;&gt; you taught us that this will come upon us. &gt;&gt; We saw that events have triggered Lord. Years ago, what we are experiencing today, &gt;&gt; you told us that a squeeze will come. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; And you said for us to prepare. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Prepare and make sure that we know you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. whom to know is life eternal. &gt;&gt; Lord, may this knowledge that you require of us unfold in a greater measure today. For if we know you and we can hold your hands and you can hold on to us, Father, then we will be that invincible army &gt;&gt; that you promise will come upon this earth that we will not be moved. We will not be shaken. This Eve will not go down like the first Eve. This is the eve that you have predestinated to come. The eve will that will not be broken. &gt;&gt; A people that will not be defeated. &gt;&gt; An army of the living God that will not be shaken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you that this word has been committed to us. &gt;&gt; This word lies in our hearts this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we pray that we will not disappoint you. We will not bring shame and reproach to you, Father. &gt;&gt; But we will stand, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; as the people that you will be proud of, &gt;&gt; when you challenge the enemy and said, "How dust thy consider my servant Job?" &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, this morning we could stand before you &gt;&gt; as such a people &gt;&gt; to make you proud, Father. &gt;&gt; We seek your glory. We seek your honor. Forgive us for the ways we have let you down. Give us strength to go again. And now, Father, as we depart one from another, we pray that you would take us to our homes in peace and safety. Bring us again and send the word of light. Father, that we may be able to walk in it as in the day. Bless this ministry. Bless this people as we go. For we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. in.
