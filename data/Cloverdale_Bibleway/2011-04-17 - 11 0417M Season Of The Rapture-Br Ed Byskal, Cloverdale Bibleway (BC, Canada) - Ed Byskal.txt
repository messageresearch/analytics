Let's hold that before the throne of grace this morning. He's a miracle working God. His wonders to perform. Heavenly Father, we believe in the resurrection. You said, "I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." Lord, we have heard that same voice, the voice from the excellent glory of God. Lord, we've seen you high and lifted up in the revelation of your word. We have come to the house of God to join our licks of fire to give you glory, to give you honor, and to give you praise this morning. We can say you are a miracle working God. Your wonders to perform. And Lord, you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, you came in Jericho. You left Jericho, but there was a blind man that was waiting there for the son of David. Lord, there's many this morning. We are waiting for the move of the Holy Ghost to meet the needs of your children once again. So with uplifted hands, we cry out to you. Living God, meet our needs this morning. Anoint us to believe for all things are possible to them that believe. Lord, these requests that have been spoken, hands that are raised, a pastor that will come, anoint us, Lord, to receive the promises of God. Hallelujah. You are the same God that spoke to that raging Red Sea. But we can say this morning by your revelation, that same God is living in me. So we speak healing in the name of Jesus Christ. We speak deliverance for the glory of God. Lord, we take you at your promise this morning. Lord Jesus, we ask that you will touch everyone in divine presence that they will not leave the house of God sick, but they will go healed for the glory of God and every request that was spoken. Pray Lord that you will have your divine will and way. Charge your people Lord with the Holy Ghost and fire. Lord, we don't want formality. We want the moving of God. We desire the word to stimulate us Lord. Hallelu from the youngest to the oldest. May the Holy Ghost move. We love you this morning. &gt;&gt; Ask me not, oh gentle savior. Hear our humble cry. Lord, deep needs are here. Souls need to be saved. Deliverance is here. Those that need deliverance. Father, you are the mighty horn of Israel. You are our deliverer and our savior. Let the joy of God permeate this building. &gt;&gt; And Father, let the victory of Christ be our portion. &gt;&gt; We love your people. We pray God that you will have your divine will and way now. &gt;&gt; Anoint us to hear what the Holy Spirit would have us to hear now. We commit all things to you for your glory and honor in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. You may have your seats this morning. Hallelujah. Wonderful atmosphere that you can create and I appreciate that very much. Sister Okeello's got a special for us this morning. Believe it's a song that she's just recently sang. So maybe she can come and bless us with a special this morning. We're going to turn right to the word and give our pastor as much time as he needs this morning to deliver the thought that the Lord has laid upon his heart. I believe it's the burden of the word, the hour in which we're living in. It's pertinent today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we can sing my redeemer is faithful and true as she's coming to get ready. &gt;&gt; My redeemer is faithful and true. Everything he has said, he will do. Every morning his mercies are new. My redeemer is faithful and true. My red redeemer is faithful and true. Everything he has said he will do. Every morning his mercy for you. I believe her is faithful and true. Bless you this morning. I've stood on the bank of a wide raging river, trusting that I'd get across. I've made my way through some valleys and deserts, believing I'd never get lost. Lo, I've stood at the foot of what felt like Mount Everest, knowing I would have the strength for the climb. Through every trial, each test and temptation, one thing is sure every time. Over and over, again, God is faithful. Over and over, again, through it all, he's made me a able to stand and survive to come through a life when it sure looked like I wouldn't win. Jesus is with me. I'll claim the victory over and over again. If you ask me why, I have no hesitation. God does what he says he will do. I'd simply say every battle has taught me there's nothing he won't take me through. So why should I dwell on the hardships and struggles when I look just beyond them I see the way this will end is with great celebration. And deep in my heart I believe over and over again and again. God is faithful. Over and over again again and again. Through it all. He's made me able to stand and survive. to come through a life when it sure looked like I couldn't win. Jesus is with me. I'll claim the victory over and over again. Over and over again and again. Lord, you're faithful. Over and over, again and again, through it all. You've made me able to stand and survive. To come through alive when it sure look like I couldn't win. Jesus, you're with me. I'll claim the victory over over again. Yes, Jesus is with us. We'll claim it victory over over again. Praise the Lord. Victory in the camp this morning. Amen. Why don't we sing the master of the wind? I know the master of the wind. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. The sun is shining. I know the way because I know I know the way. I know. He made the sun to shine again. I know the master. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing it once again. I know the master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. He can call the storm and the sun to shine again. I know the master of the wind. I'm amazed that he loved me. Heat. Heat. Hey, heat away. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. I say all my things I want for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're approaching the &gt;&gt; We're approaching the Easter season. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; On Tuesday starts a Passover for the Jewish people on Tuesday. And they're going to be remembering the whole week. And uh for the most part, they're blinded yet &gt;&gt; to really what happened &gt;&gt; that week. But here we approach the greatest week. Just think. And we're here to be able to rejoice. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why our sins were all washed away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're rejoicing in it. My my what glory and praise can go to our Lord Jesus Christ. And if any people can rejoice as those to whom he has revealed himself to. I am truly amazed. I'm amazed. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Heat. Heat. Wonderful Lord Jesus. And with that on our lips and knowing that the Passover, we wanted to announce this earlier in the week because we generally like to have it announced ahead of time, but we're going to have communion tonight for those that can be here. We'd like to announce it a full week ahead so that the people in Seattle can come up and be with us. But I just was so heavy on my heart and we just asked, you know, brother Tom asked and spoke to the sister see if we can have the bread ready and that was on the spur of the moment. But I just want to have communion tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord's table foot washing. Brother John Landes is going to be speaking and uh so you want to be here if at all possible. Uh so that's this evening and we'll start right on time and make it as have perhaps a little shorter uh preliminaries. also those that are seeing the going through the school building and uh there are there are are I think about every half hour this afternoon is at every half hour starting about 2 2:00 and every half hour. So, if you want to go through, you they've asked you to sign up, but if you're haven't signed up, please let brother Kim uh show you what has been taking place. Most of you haven't been in the in that building, but a tremendous amount of work. And for those brothers that have given their time, and we just want to we don't know how to say thank you. God reward you. the people who have given, you have given, you've sacrificed in one way or another. And God uh God has helped us. Amen. He's helped us immensely. I want to say to you that if time should go on, and we don't know if it will, but if time should go on any length of time, there's young people who are in their coming up into their teens. And they will be not the church of tomorrow, but the church of today. really taking their position. had an email from brother Tim Andes and uh he let me know that he along with some other young people have been able to have been able to u load 100 Portuguese messages, &gt;&gt; excuse me, in four different formats in three days. And that's what like that's like a 100 messages, four formats. That's 400. And I want to say God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'll probably make reference to it a wee bit in the scripture in the while in the ministry because uh that's the mission of the church. &gt;&gt; And I'll read a quote. Brother Brandham said, you know, God help Jefferson Tabernacle if they ever lose that vision. &gt;&gt; We're not just a church. We're here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; We're not here for a good time, just a, you know, fellowship. That's not it. &gt;&gt; We're here on a mission. &gt;&gt; Fulfill this mission. &gt;&gt; Fulfill this labor. &gt;&gt; Pray the Lord of the harvest that he'll have laborers. &gt;&gt; Into the fields. &gt;&gt; Amen. There a lot of people behind the scenes. It's not those just behind the pulpit, but the people behind the scenes. I want to give a special welcome to our sister Sylvia Nolton's Meyer sitting here between Gail and Sister Ruth Frederick. Sister Sylvia, would you just raise your hand so the people will know who it is now? You might be, she might be new to you, but you're not new to her. Sister Sylvia and her husband Carl Carl passed away last year. And uh they've been streaming the meetings here for about since 207, excuse me. And uh so she even knew where people were sitting. and she said, "I just want to be here in fellowship with the church." And so she has moved all the way from Georgia to be here. And brother Matt Desmet, Brother Terry Schmoutz. I want to give a special thanks to them. They went and hauled our sister Sylvia's stuff out here. and uh she doesn't know exactly where we're going to unload it yet, but that's fine. And we want you to make her feel welcome. I know that you have already. We don't want to smother her, but you know, make her feel welcome. We really uh appreciate the step of faith that she is uh without her husband has taken and it's it's it's been a massive thing. Our brother Terry was telling me I I thought that they had gone through three different trucks. He told me now it's five. Five trucks. Tie rod ends on one, the motor seized on the next one. And I don't know what happened on the others. Maybe Randy, it'll be over to you and your We say praise God. We always go back to the message brother Tom preached who said it's bad. &gt;&gt; I'll probably put a plug in here through brother Randy. He got us in touch with or got in touch with the the headman CEO of Budget International. And I think that I just said to some brothers, I said, "Well, how do how does he know him?" I said, "Brother Randy probably knows the Pope Secretary by her first name. I haven't found anybody that brother Randy doesn't know. So anyway, we got with the top man, told them the whole all the details and all the trouble we're having with the first two trucks. And uh he said, "When those men arrive in the West Coast to Bellingham, just have them list absolutely every cost, and this trip's not going to cost you anything. So, Sister Sylvia started out here with it costing quite a bit and ended up with it costing nothing. Just as long as you're allowed to have a little trouble along the line. So, God bless our sister Sylvia and brother Terry, sister Shannon, Linda flew out to fly back with her and Wesley and Amanda. They're about 90 miles from her place and they went up and and arranged other trucks and everything. It's it, you know, the body of Christ is a wonderful body. It's just a wonderful body. That's all we can say. Uh, next Sunday we're going to have just one service. That's Easter Sunday. It'll be 11:00 in the morning. The Saints are coming up from Seattle also, but we'll just have one service because of the traffic at the border. I was in Nexus yesterday and it still took about 50 minutes, which is unusual, but nevertheless, uh then we can have a relaxed time, have as long as we wish, and it's it's we're remembering Easter, Easter Sunday. All right. Thank you for standing. If you'll take your Bibles, I'll have you turn to Luke's Gospel the third chapter and we'll commence to read. I have two places to read and the second will be Romans 8. Get me Thanks. All right. Luke the 3 chapter. I'm going to read verses uh 1:3 and then 12- 15. Now in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontis Pilate being governor of Judea and Herod being tetriarch of Galilee and his brother Philip tetriarch of Itia and of the region of uh Tricontis and Lassanius the tetriarch of Abelene. Anna, Annis the and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zachcharias in the wilderness. Isn't it amazing? All these great fellows, high priests and all the rest of it. But the word of God comes to John in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he came unto all the country. And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. Verse 12. Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? Notice now publicans are coming. Master, what shall we do? And he said unto them, exact no more than that which is appointed you. And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, "And what shall we do?" And he said unto them, "Do no do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages." And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ or not. And then if you'll turn to Romans, I'll read 8 and verse 18. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. &gt;&gt; For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to the redemption of our body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just have prayer. Our loving father, we're so thankful we can say, "Our Father, &gt;&gt; which art in heaven, &gt;&gt; hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. We pray, oh God, you'll forgive us our sins, forgive us our debts as we forgive others who are indebted to us. We thank you for your provision. Thank you for the food you provided, but thank you for the spiritual food. Thank you for this message, oh God, and the gift of the Holy Spirit that has been given to fill us that we might understand the things that you have given to the children. Oh God, your children that you've called, the elect lady, thank you for this bride message, oh God. pray that you will inspire all who are gathered here and those that are streaming and those that will hear the service, Lord, what by whatever means. And I pray, Father, you'll bless those that labor in the word, oh God, and the hearers today, the speaker, Father, I surrender myself to you. May your will be done. May you be glorified. You're the only worthy one, oh God. Come and move amongst us, oh God, and get great glory to your name. All hail the name of Jesus Christ. How we want to glorify you, Lord. Thank you, Father. Anoint us now, Lord Jesus. In your name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. There are two things that I would like to uh draw to your attention out of these scriptures which we read and it has to do with the expectation. I want to speak to you on something that's very pressing on my heart and it has to do with the expectation in the season of the rapture. Now the Bible tells us that of the ministry of John the Baptist and that was the spirit of Elijah that was sent to introduce Jesus Christ. I would please ask you to grasp what God was doing because you can't manufacture this. But what he did, he details in verses 1, 2, and three how that all of these various men and uh political celebrities we could say were in their regions of power and authority and so on. But then beside that, here's John in the wilderness and the word of God comes to John in the wilderness and he begins preaching and the publicans come to him, the military comes to him, the religious leaders come to him. The Bible even says one place are all gathered to him, all Judea, Samaria and so on. And there and and then the Bible says this and as the people as they were in expectation. Now the reason they were in expectation is because when when the certain word of certain promises of God when they come into the the time of their fulfillment there's a movement on the people even the people don't perhaps understand it but they they come into a state or an atmosphere of expectation they know that something should happen and like even the public today not just even Christians but the public you know they ask the question what's happening and something's happening they they're totally in the dark they're confused about it what is taking place it's not the same as it used to be uh something is is uh something is developing something's evolving and there's all kinds of uh philosophical uh ideas and thoughts about it and then the churches take it from different angles and so on but the Bible says and as The people were in expectation and all men, not a few, all men mused in their hearts. That is, they pondered. They meditated. They they they were filled with wonderment in their hearts uh regarding John whether he was the Christ or not. Now, they didn't have that wonderment about Elijah or Elisha or Moses or Samuel or any of the other prophets or Isaiah or Jeremiah or Daniel, they didn't have that. There wasn't the people weren't filled with wonderment uh whether he's the Christ or not. But when the spirit of Elijah comes in the season &gt;&gt; of the redeemer's coming, &gt;&gt; Christ's first coming, then the people they were there was an atmosphere that God had brought upon the people and they were they were filled with expectation. It like something's happening, something's got to happen. &gt;&gt; Something must be taking place that they they feel it coming upon them. They feel the pressure of the time, but they don't know what it is. And then and then when they see John coming with the spirit of Elijah preaching what he was preaching and demonstrating, and he didn't even demonstrate any miracles, you know, I I I even spoke to brother Brandon when we were together. I said it always was especially uh uh it was a wonderment to me that John the Baptist I mean I'm sorry Elijah came and he I understand from the scripture that he performed four miracles but he didn't really preach and Elisha came and performed asked for double portion he performed eight miracles and he didn't really preach so Elijah came the first coming second coming he He did miracles but didn't really preach. Then comes the spirit of Elijah on John the Baptist and he preached but didn't do any miracles. And then comes the Elijah ministry in our time preaching and doing miracles. It's a consummation of the whole thing. And it was a doing miracles first and then preaching and bringing a message. To me it was very remarkable. But when John began to preach, the Bible says, "And the people mused. They they wondered. They pondered. They they turned it around like it even means that they it they revolved. It revolved in their thoughts. Who is this? And what is this? And is this the Christ? Is he the Messiah or not?" It was so so near because he is the he's the one to introduce the Messiah. and they almost become inseparable. And then now now John John the Baptist came in the physical body and Jesus the Messiah was there. &gt;&gt; It's it's not surprising that they had that confusion in their mind because Jesus was already there. He just hadn't revealed himself yet and John was there to introduce him. And so that is why it was just like it was almost being homogenized together where John in one body, Jesus in one body, and he could say, "Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." But in the end time, the forerunner is in a body, but the one he's introducing is not. &gt;&gt; He's in another realm. He's in the unseen. So he has to take the one that's in the scene and take him into the unseen back and forth and back and forth so he can say to the people, "He's here." &gt;&gt; As much as you are here, he's here. As much as the angels are here as much as television is here. As much as the airwaves are carrying voices, he's also here. He's more real than those things. More real than my voice going out to you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? If you can grasp that and hold that, &gt;&gt; then if we hear what the Elijah spirit, the prophet has to say, it will set up an expectation &gt;&gt; for what is to take place. &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the people were in expectation and they all mused in their hearts regarding John. So when the time of deliverance arrived for the children of Israel in they were in bondage. They were slaves in Egypt. But when the time and the season because the the scripture the promise to Abraham was that his seed would go into bondage but after 400 years they would come out with a mighty hand. So now they're not aware. Those people perhaps aren't aware that that is what God spoke to their father Abraham 400 years ago. Generations of children have come and gone and now they're slaves, but they they were crying out to God. And God said, "I've heard their cry &gt;&gt; and I've come down &gt;&gt; to deliver them. Go thou, therefore, he's saying to Moses. Why? The season had come. But the thing was, because the word was coming into his season, a spirit of expectation was falling upon the people. Even though they couldn't identify exactly what that expectation was, &gt;&gt; they just knew that something was to take place. And they came into a spirit of expectation when Moses came on the scene and said, "Let my people go." I tell you what, those people said, "We've been waiting for that. &gt;&gt; We've been waiting for this." &gt;&gt; And it was so compelling that even even other people followed them and went with them. &gt;&gt; I don't know if any Jews stayed behind, but nevertheless, or of the Hebrews, I should say, but Moses arrived on the scene and the people were gathered to his message. Expectation is not only what we would refer to the word as I mean expectation but it is awaiting. It's looking for them who look for him. This isn't that I I'm all swallowed up with my daytoday things. I'm all swallowed up with my work. I'm all swallowed up with my business. I'm all swallowed up with my education. I'm all swallowed up with all of these. That's not it. &gt;&gt; It is a waiting, &gt;&gt; a looking. And these other things are just peripheral. They're on there side issues. &gt;&gt; I'm looking. I'm waiting. And for those that wait and look for him, shall he appear the second time to those that look for him? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a hunter. A lot of brothers here have hunted. I can tell you one thing or fished. You get out in the woods and when I go hunting, I mean the moment moment I leave camp, everything's changed. He just I I I take a few steps and I just stop and look. And I love getting alone because I'll get up and if especially if the wind is blowing and I get the wind blowing against me and I I I'm not worried about the politics. I'm not worried about the financial things or any meltdown. &gt;&gt; I'm not worried about I don't think I just don't my mind isn't there. My mind is just here and I think I might see maybe I just see an ear of an animal behind a tree. I tell tell you what friends, you are focused. You are looking. You're not you're not you're not thinking about another thing. You're just thinking this is what you're here for. And and if that's that way just in the natural, how much more so? We ought to be just be taking a step at a time. And I'm just here. This is what I'm This is what I've been born for. I've been born here to look and to wait and to watch and to expect &gt;&gt; a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Somebody here is going to see it. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to see it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who cares then &gt;&gt; where you what station you get to in life? &gt;&gt; Who cares about &gt;&gt; any fame or fortune or labors or or anything else? Who cares about that? &gt;&gt; If you should be granted the privilege as you have been granted the privilege to hear what you have already heard. And what I'm saying is today, this message by this Elijah came for a purpose. To put you into an atmosphere of expectation, &gt;&gt; to grip you, &gt;&gt; to move you, to capture you, to apprehend you, &gt;&gt; to select you, &gt;&gt; elected, chosen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the chosen of the Lord &gt;&gt; to catch and see and and to be participant in &gt;&gt; a resurrection &gt;&gt; called to have the change of your body. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a sweep. It's not going to sweep over all humanity. It's going to sweep over certain ones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said the rising of the sun, when the sun shines, it shines on the rocks, &gt;&gt; but nothing happens. It shines on the dirt, but if there's no seed, nothing happens. It shines on the weeds. &gt;&gt; It shines on the thorns. It shines on all of it. But there is some that's been elected. &gt;&gt; The wheat is wheat. &gt;&gt; And that's what comes out of the seed is wheat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And there's something by way of seed, a predestinated seed, and it can only bring forth a predestinated life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And because of that, &gt;&gt; this message came to put you in expectation. Didn't come to give you another doctor, another religion, another church. &gt;&gt; It came to put you in expectation &gt;&gt; for what God had promised &gt;&gt; in that word. This isn't Moses message. &gt;&gt; This revealing message &gt;&gt; and this is very interesting word. It's the only time it's used like this in the Bible. The Bible does say that David he did muse. But then the people they mused whether this was the Christ or not, whether John was the Christ or not. And the the root word is very very interesting because in the Greek it is to uh to put together or to collect. Like when you have a log, the word log, we we log the the people on the on this boat or we log there's a log of the of the people who may be on a plane. And you look at the log and they've collected all the people that's on that plane and put it on this list. It comes from mused. And so I have to put it together for you. So the the root word is to put together or to collect when the people mused. It's to ponder, meditate, consider, to reason, and to put different reasons together to reckon up to reckon up the reasons why this is so. And it concludes that if you consider and ponder just in your in the in your bank account, if you consider, and this is one of the examples they give, they give. If you consider that and you evaluate and you collect things up, all your reasons for determining I have $25 left in my bank account. The word mused, it reduces it down. Says, if you have reasoned and collected all your thoughts together, I have $25 in my bank account. The conclusion is you have $25 in your bank account. That's how powerful that word is. It it is actually to impute. You impute. And the scripture says that Abraham believed God &gt;&gt; and God imputed to him &gt;&gt; righteousness &gt;&gt; and he accepted that. He took the thoughts of God and he and and he gathered all the thoughts of God. And and God God imputed to him righteousness because he believed God. &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is say, "I believe God there. I believe God here. I believe God there." The promise says, "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God." I believe that. The Bible says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." I believe that. The Bible says he died for our sins. I believe that when time you collect those together, you got eternal life because he said it. Not because you feel it. You may not feel any different. You may feel worse when you're done, but you believe the promise of God. You believe you have $25. You have. You've collected all the all the data, all the things. You've collected it into a log set. At the bottom, it says, "I have $25. I don't see the bank. I don't see the account, but I have $25 in the account." I say, "You may not feel eternal life. You may not see eternal life, but I've gathered all. I've logged it all together, and I have eternal life." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when I collect Luke 17:30, when you see the days of Lot again, when they'll be building and so on and daring, are they building? &gt;&gt; When you see the days of Sodom again, do you see them? &gt;&gt; Okay, we're collecting it all together. Even so shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed. Have you seen that? &gt;&gt; And you hear that? Do you hear the son of man speak through that messenger that even so this will be the forerunner? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that the angel of the lord appeared at the river Ohio? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? He said as John the Baptist forerran the first coming so will your message for the second. You believe that? &gt;&gt; We're collecting it together. We're making a log of the promise. Hallelujah. And you believe what he said that the dead in Christ shall rise first. And then you believe that we who remain shall be caught up together with them. You believe you collected in the law and we shall be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why do we believe it? Because we've mused, &gt;&gt; we've pondered, &gt;&gt; we've read it, &gt;&gt; we've ate it, &gt;&gt; we've thought about it, we've listened to it in our car, we listen to it in our bed, we read it, we come to church. This is why we're here. We're musing about it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're saying, I believe that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you've come to that point, the almighty God says, "I've imputed it to you." &gt;&gt; You believe you have 25, you have 25. You believe you have eternal life, you do have eternal life. &gt;&gt; And the prophet messenger says, "How long do you have it? As long as you believe it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How long are you healed? as long as you believe it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; And when the people believed the vindicated messenger, &gt;&gt; then whatever God promised &gt;&gt; by that messenger for that season, when the people believed it, &gt;&gt; it was imputed to them. That's why I stress believing what he said. &gt;&gt; And God had said to Abram, "Know of assurityity. Know for certain." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That your seed will be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them 400 years. And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge. and afterward shall they come out with great substance. So they knew that. I guess that's why they went and borrowed everything that they could when they left Egypt. And the Apostle Paul says, "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time, you have some, you have your share, you have your problems. We all do. &gt;&gt; I don't know anybody here that doesn't. We've got our concerns. We've got our burdens. And they're big. They can be very big. They can cause tears, pain, sorrow. That's why I wasn't here Wednesday night's service. I got word late late Tuesday night that a very dear friend of mine had passed away suddenly and we had a very short time to get to the service to be at the funeral and how brief time is how unpredictable it is. We all have our uh concerns and some of them perhaps go on for some time. But the sufferings of this present time are not worthy. &gt;&gt; Not worthy. &gt;&gt; You want to repeat that to yourself. My problems are not worthy &gt;&gt; to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For the earnest expectation, here it is. The earnest expectation of the creature. Hello creatures. &gt;&gt; Creatures of earnest expectation. The earnest expectation of the creature waitth for the manifestation of the sons of God. And brother Brandham says that manifestation of the sons of God could not come until the end time. &gt;&gt; Perhaps I'll come to it a little bit later on. The expectation, the act of looking, not only looking, but looking confidently. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know it's going to happen &gt;&gt; in the time of Moses. And I'm just going back and forth a little bit. We are told in the and God spoke through so many of the of his uh seers and sages and prophets and kings and David referred to it how he brought them out. It isn't that he brought them out of Egypt. He brought them out with a mighty hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't some limp lame thing. With a mighty hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If if God did that &gt;&gt; for Hebrews, &gt;&gt; many who would perish in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Many who would perish, listen to me, in the wilderness. If he divided the Red Sea, if he allowed the people to go through on dry land, if he swallowed up the whole armies of the superpower of the earth at that time, what do you think he will do for the elect that are going to sit around the marriage table? &gt;&gt; What do you think he's going to do for the bride of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Believe it, friends. There is nothing, nothing, there's no power that can separate you from the love of God. Believe it. Put it in your log. &gt;&gt; Add it to your series. Collect it. &gt;&gt; No one. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; To the elect. &gt;&gt; We can't believe that we're elect and somehow God is going to desert us. &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing. You're the apple of his eye. Amen. &gt;&gt; His eye is ever upon you with every move. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, this word, I wish I could pronounce it for you, but it starts out it's log, I z or zed, however you wish. O m ai. And it's permount logid zahi but it starts with the log and that is the important issue. It says of this Greek word it deals with reality. It's not dealing with you know uh something that is uh abstract. It deals with reality. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is to count out and to weigh out and to meditate upon it, to take into an account and to make an account. &gt;&gt; I I feel I need to stay with that just for a few moments. You've got $25. You have it. &gt;&gt; You've logged that. You've calculated that. You've accounted that. &gt;&gt; It deals with reality. For what s the scripture, Abraham believed God? Why did he believe God? Well, God said this and God said that and God said whatever else to him and he believed it. He didn't do a, you know, selection and say, "Well, that sounds all right, but this one doesn't look very possible." That isn't the issue. &gt;&gt; He believed God. Whatever God said, he believed it. &gt;&gt; God said, "Leave your kindred." So, he did. leave your country. So he did. Go to a place that I'll show you. So he did. And he didn't know where he was going. &gt;&gt; That's a kind of belief. &gt;&gt; You're you're you're required to do the same thing. You don't know where this thing's going to end up. &gt;&gt; A lot of us can say, and I'm sure most of us have said at some point in time, I never dreamed that I would encounter this uh you know, in my walk with Christ, &gt;&gt; but we did. &gt;&gt; Did we stop? No, we didn't stop. We carried on. Why do we carry on? Cuz we can't do anything else. &gt;&gt; Because we put it in the log. That was God that spoke. And I believe it sir. &gt;&gt; It's God who said Malachi 4 would come and I believe it &gt;&gt; and I've heard it. &gt;&gt; How many others have heard the same thing you've heard and rejected it? But you heard it and you believed it. That's right. &gt;&gt; That is why you believed it because there's a seed in there that that deep believes it &gt;&gt; and was calling for it. &gt;&gt; I'm sure it'll be the it would be the testimony of many if not all here. &gt;&gt; Before you even heard the message, you experienced a crying, a calling out. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was calling out for something that was real. &gt;&gt; I've seen this and I saw that and I tried this and I tried that but it didn't satisfy. What say the scripture? Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness. And Abraham accepted that he was righteous. It wasn't just that God accounted it to him, but he believed that account. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says also Romans 4 and 22, "And therefore it was imputed to him. It was accounted to him. It was put in his account. It was reckoned to him that he was righteous." Now, let me take you quickly. The angel said, "Come hither, and I will show you the lamb's wife." And it was granted to her that she would be er arrayed in fine linen. She was not just dressed, she was arrayed in fine linen. &gt;&gt; Amen. which is the righteousness of the saints. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, and you can find it and you want to search it out. He said, "Let me dress that bride." &gt;&gt; Why could he say that? Because he knew that he was coming forth with a message and he knew, listen friends, there was a fraction. I just thought I would might do that this morning. How many people here never ever saw Brother Brandham in his lifetime? Raise your hands. How many here did see him? You could stand. I know. Sister did. Sister Andy's as well. No. One, two, three. were four. Five. Thank you. Five. Six. One over there with seven. There seven in this audience. Seven. What made the rest of you believe? Blessed are they &gt;&gt; that see not &gt;&gt; and believe. More blessed are they &gt;&gt; that see not and have believed. Put it in your log. &gt;&gt; I had something. &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. There's something down here that absolutely convinced me &gt;&gt; and caused me to surrender &gt;&gt; and caused me to uh to to sell out, &gt;&gt; to give up, &gt;&gt; to surrender. Some of you left &gt;&gt; homes &gt;&gt; and left families &gt;&gt; and you have you have given yourself completely to the word that you heard. What caused such a thing? &gt;&gt; That is God's grace, abundant grace to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How wonderful it is. The people mused in their heart. The Bible says they mused in their heart about John. They didn't mu they didn't just muse in their heart. I love the way the scriptures. They didn't just muse in their heart, but they mused in their heart about this person. I want to say to this congregation, I can tell you one thing. The whole world, the whole religious world mused in their heart concerning William Brham. &gt;&gt; They had never seen anything like that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And they could not produce it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's what gave him such confidence. Read or listen to Godhead explained. Right. &gt;&gt; And he has all those ministers there in Chicago, doctors and DDDs and, you know, all the all the degrees of of of the religious world. And he and he just takes them so simply through the scripture. And here's this man who they don't want to accept. They don't want to accept his idea of the Godhead. They don't want to accept the, can you believe it? Not accept the baptism. There was those who said, "We're going to be baptized." He said, "Not one showed up &gt;&gt; to be baptized." Can you imagine ministers preaching to thousands of people refusing to be baptized in the name of their lovely Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Isn't this preposterous? &gt;&gt; Isn't this unbelievable? Amen. &gt;&gt; And he kindly told them, you know, if you can't take the scripture and come and stand here beside me and not one &gt;&gt; came and stood beside him. Oh, after he was gone, they had all kinds of things. Oh, yes. Great declarations and prophecies and everything else. And I you know what I say? Nonsense. &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense. when he was here, they were so amused and they wondered and they tried to duplicate. &gt;&gt; That's what he that's what he says. I hope you're learning &gt;&gt; in the message. You know, he talks about impersonators. &gt;&gt; Now, he said he even named brethren and he said, "My dear brothers, they're my dear brothers." But he did not excuse or compromise on what they were doing. They were impersonating his ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer lines. Where did prayer lines come from? Prayer lines. I mean, that was the reason why prayer lines came into existence is because brother Brand had to take them by the hand. &gt;&gt; And reveal the disease, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I I I stood right there. I was as close as some of you people there and watched it while he took he shook a deacon's hand out of my elers's hand out of out of my church and he just shook his hand across the restaurant table and he jerked and looked at me said did you get that get get that I tell you what it just I didn't have any capacity to get that but he was just shaking hands with the brother and he picked it up you know what it caused us to do it caused us to muse But I kept musing. I kept pondering. I could not get away. I kept collecting all the all the facts and the fulfillment of the scripture. And finally, when I begin to see Malachi 4 and begin to see Luke 17:30 and beginning to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, and see Revelation 10, and Revelation 3 and 14, the messenger to the church age, and 10 and seven, and by the time I put it all in the account, I could say, I got a message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what? I got a revelation. &gt;&gt; And others could say, "You do? What is the revelation?" Oh my. It's so precious. &gt;&gt; Have you got a revelation? &gt;&gt; Might be mysterious to a lot of folks. &gt;&gt; It's more real &gt;&gt; than your physical body. &gt;&gt; You can pinch your hand if you wish, but I can tell you that my revelation is greater than even your body that you're sitting in. Hallelujah. Because the revelation's going to outlive this body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just added this little note. The people should have listened to their heart &gt;&gt; in John the Baptist when they were musing. They should have listened to their heart and they'd been a lot better off &gt;&gt; if they'd listened to their heart. When your heart is saying yes, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; yay, &gt;&gt; amen, listen to it. Don't listen to your head and say, well, this, that, the other thing. Listen to your heart. &gt;&gt; Your heart will lead you &gt;&gt; in a more correct &gt;&gt; place. Although Jesus had not even revealed himself completely at that time yet when he began to come and reveal himself to the people uh it was a separating time even then. Now I have I have some quote that I want to give you here. When the people believed the vindicated messenger, then whatever God promised for that season was imputed to them. &gt;&gt; This is a rapture message. &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; This is about the ultimate victory that was purchased at Calvary. That's what this whole message is about. This is about the forerunner coming and introducing a people to Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is not here physically. We don't need that because we're looking as Apostle Paul said to the unseen. &gt;&gt; Are you looking to the unseen? Not some figment of your imagination, a reality. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, if you want to if you want to understand me better, go home and listen to listen to some of the prayer lines. not to take you back 40, 50 years. Listen to some of the prayer lines. And when when you see this man, when you hear him telling the people the just intricate details of their life, I want you to commence musing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And say to yourself, who is that? &gt;&gt; It's not William Brennham, &gt;&gt; seventh grade educated Kuckian. Not him. He never saw these people. They're saying, "You've never seen me before. Are we strangers? They're strangers." Muse about it. Think about it. Ponder it. Who is that? You say, "Well, you say, "Well, that's simple, Brother Ed. It's it's none other than Jesus Christ. Where is that Jesus Christ, then?" Well, he he's right there. He wouldn't even do that. He wouldn't even start that until he was at the platform. All right. So now we have a messenger who God is speaking through his mouth. And now we take our musing further. What is the purpose? &gt;&gt; What is he saying? What's he doing this for? Why is he talking to people who will not even receive Jesus Christ? What is the whole purpose? What is this? So he says it's the sign. It's a sign. The sign is pointing somewhere. It's a sign of the resurrection. Oh, this is actually pointing to the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Where is it pointing? &gt;&gt; To the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a sign taking us to the resurrection. If I just keep following the signal, &gt;&gt; we ought to end up to the destination. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; These aren't idle words when I say &gt;&gt; there are those here &gt;&gt; and I hope it rings something true in you &gt;&gt; that shall see the resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's according to this message because it's a sign of the resurrection. What are you young men and young ladies going to do? I'm sure you're going to see it. &gt;&gt; I'm expecting to see it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How much expectation do you have? Every &gt;&gt; day. &gt;&gt; Every day, my friends. Every &gt;&gt; day. &gt;&gt; I look for it every day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And he said unto Abraham, "Know assurely that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them 400 years. And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterward they shall come out with great substance. They shall come out with great substance. That is what fell upon the people and expectation that they shall come out. 400 years of slavery. &gt;&gt; But something came into them. We shall not stay here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something has to come upon the people of this message that says, "We're not staying here." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not a resident of Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It's not just a song. I'm bound for the promised land. I am indeed on my way to the promised land. in the message. Is this a sign of the answer? And you know when that was it was just before and this was foretelling of the coming of the of the angelic messengers and the opening of the seals. He said that angel coming and said, this was on the Ohio River before many, many people as John was sent to wind up the Old Testament and to bring forth the introduction of Christ. Your message will wind up the loose ends and I will introduce the Messiah just before and will introduce the Messiah just before his coming. the message of the last days. Notice the mighty angel swore with an oath that time would be no more. Now we're in Revelation 10. And just think of this a minute now. In other words, muse about this for a few moments, friends. &gt;&gt; In the in the messages of the last few weeks, there's been one thing that's been pronounced to me, and I want you to muse about this. people. I know that people have wondered, you know, where did that come from? Because I have become conscious. I'm grabbing a loose end that's over here and a loose end that's over here and one that's up there and one that's back maybe some years ago. And by the time you pull those loose ends together, you've got a composite picture. &gt;&gt; And the composite picture, you know, like blows me away. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's because he it's prophesied that this message came to bring the loose ends together. &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of loose ends out there, folks. &gt;&gt; I'm not down on the denominational people. They're doing the best they can with loose ends. &gt;&gt; But until you accept and put into your log right here at the top, I got Malachi 4. I have Elijah the prophet. I believe in the spirit. And that because of that, I have a message. And in this message is a bunch of loose ends that's been put all together again. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; This angel come down from heaven. &gt;&gt; So the other seven angels of the seven church ages were earthly messengers. But this angel, &gt;&gt; all of the message is finished. The seventh angel winds up the whole thing. And this angel comes not to the earth. He isn't a man from the earth as the as the messengers to the church ages. That's finished. But this angel brings the next announcement. And an angel means a messenger. And he comes down from heaven clothed in that pillar of light cloud with a rainbow over his head. And a rainbow is a covenant. It was Christ with one foot on the land and one foot on the sea. And he swore that time shall be no more. &gt;&gt; Where are we at, sir? &gt;&gt; Where are we at? &gt;&gt; Now, he said before a lot of this was fulfilled. He's asking it. This is even before the experience &gt;&gt; of the cloud formation of the angels coming. Where are we at? He's asking, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes. What's all this about? &gt;&gt; He said, I'm asking you. &gt;&gt; I say that puts us into great expectation. &gt;&gt; The other angels were messengers, men of the earth. But this angel, this said to the angel of the church of Leodya, to the angel of the church of Ephesus, messengers of the earth, men, &gt;&gt; messengers, prophets, and so forth to the church. But this one didn't come from the earth. &gt;&gt; He came down from heaven &gt;&gt; because the mystery is all finished. He came down from heaven because the mystery is all finished. &gt;&gt; Hello, folks. &gt;&gt; Whether you received it or not, the mystery is all finished. &gt;&gt; That's why I urge you hear the messages. And I would urge you to hear them in a in an order and hear especially those uh messages of significance with doctrine and meat in it. Christ is the mystery God revealed and the third exodus and and the token and these and the seals. You listen to them in an order and you'll you'll the loose ends. &gt;&gt; He'll make it known to you as you have need of and it will do one thing for you. It will put you into an atmosphere of expectation. I was talking to somebody here just the other day and they said they were in a message and they know that they've been in it maybe dozens of times. They said it was as though they had never read it before. &gt;&gt; I can say amen to that. &gt;&gt; This one didn't come from the earth. &gt;&gt; He came down from heaven &gt;&gt; because the mystery is all finished. And when the mysteries finished, the angel said, "Time shall be no more." The seven thunders throat out their voices out &gt;&gt; because the thunder is the voice of God speaking it out. Not just here to these ears, &gt;&gt; not just what's on a tape, but what what God speaks and vibrates within your own soul. And you know the amazing thing is last week I believe it was had about eight or nine brothers up here and they all quoted exactly the same scripture from all their different languages. &gt;&gt; The mystery the amazing thing is that when the revelation of that scripture repent and be ye baptized uh repent and be ye baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall be and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. They all read the same thing in languages most of us didn't even understand or comprehend. But every one of those men got the same experience from hearing different audible sounds in their ears. &gt;&gt; I want to say to uh Tim and those that helped Elena and so on formatting the messages and sending it out, perhaps already one has realized their name is written in the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; And those that labor and those that pray and those that give shall share in this great commission. Friends, I'm consumed with it. &gt;&gt; I want to get the last one in. &gt;&gt; And that's what will give us a good time. Yes. &gt;&gt; Perhaps when you're listening and you hear this messenger say while he's talking and he calls the people and they gather and sometimes it's so laborious and he calls him by number and A1 and A2 and A3 and A4 and call it's it's it's it seems like it's time consuming and it's so laborious. God did it so simple. And he stand and you'll hear him say sometimes, you know why I'm waiting. &gt;&gt; I'm just your brother. &gt;&gt; I'm helpless unless he comes. &gt;&gt; Then you'll hear him say, "He's here. &gt;&gt; If you could, if you were waiting in the audience and could actually see it, you'd see his hand go up like this." Said, "He's here. bring the first patient. &gt;&gt; Who's he talking about? &gt;&gt; He's talking about this angel that this messenger came down from heaven &gt;&gt; and he's there to give absolute infallible &gt;&gt; infallible &gt;&gt; proof &gt;&gt; of that ministry. He's going to give a vindication that nobody here, nobody streaming, and no one who ever heard it can dispute it. &gt;&gt; Doesn't that raise our expectation? &gt;&gt; I have something. &gt;&gt; This isn't something that had to uh uh, you know, improve with time. &gt;&gt; It was perfect the first time. &gt;&gt; God never had to change his mind or improve it. It was perfect the first time. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, children. You've got a message that's been vindicated by an infallibility &gt;&gt; by a messenger from another. He came down from heaven. &gt;&gt; He He ordained that he wouldn't be seen by your natural eyes because he's in another realm &gt;&gt; and he has a messenger. Just think only one. only one. Over six billion people, but only one. &gt;&gt; Moses was only one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said Moses was only one, but he declaring one other that was unseen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, I have reason to be enthused. &gt;&gt; I have reason to preach with such zeal. I have reason because we're preaching something that the rest of the world knows very little about. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching to to give you some quotes and just to, you know, make us feel uh a different We're not here to be different. We're here for a rapture. &gt;&gt; We're here for a change. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the angel said, and you read it in Revelation 10 times, there'll be no more. What he's simply saying, if you read it in your in your uh column, it'll say that the the delay, &gt;&gt; the delay will be no longer. He won't delay the revelation any longer. He said, 'What if it's something to let us know how to enter into rapturing faith? &gt;&gt; This is in December of 62, February 63. The angels of the Lord come &gt;&gt; from the eternities and God is having him even he's preaching things and saying, "Is this it? Is this the time, sir?" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And how and and and what if it's something to let us know how to enter into rapturing faith &gt;&gt; is it &gt;&gt; will we run and leap over walls? &gt;&gt; Is there something fixing to happen &gt;&gt; and these old marred vile bodies are going to be changed? &gt;&gt; Can I live to see it? Oh Lord, is it so close that I'll see it? See you. You can pick up his his own anticipation &gt;&gt; with all of this coming. &gt;&gt; Is this it? Is this the time? Sir, &gt;&gt; can I live to say it? &gt;&gt; Sir, my brethren, what time is it? &gt;&gt; Where are we at? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will say to you this morning without any apology after reading these and expounding on them just a little bit, don't don't don't you miss it. &gt;&gt; You have no reason to miss it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's look at the watch, the calendar to see what date we're living in. Israel's in Palestine." Okay, we'll put that in the log. in her homeland. The end sign, the sixth star of David. Uh uh 2,000 years have gone by. We put all this into our log. Nearly 2500 years go by. The oldest flag is flying. Israel's back in our homeland. When the fig tree put forth its buds, this generation shall not die. Shall not pass out, pass away until all things are fulfilled. We can put that into our log. &gt;&gt; You as students know what that's all about. Put it in your log. Put it in your computer if you want. I don't care where you put it. &gt;&gt; But muse on muse on it. &gt;&gt; Many mused. It didn't do many good. Let's not muse idally. Let's muse and be and and muse so long and so ponder it so deeply that God imputes it to us. &gt;&gt; That's the reason she's bearing birth painans because there's a fight in her. There's an Esau, just a man of the world, very religious and he's all right, good fellow, clean, moral, as far as I know of, but he don't know nothing about the birthright. He's born that way. Listen, friends, we can't be affected and afflicted by those others that perhaps don't have any call. You talk to people, maybe people who even come and fellowship in church or fellowship around the message, but they don't have any call. &gt;&gt; They just don't feel any pull. And I say to you, if you're here today and you say, "Well, I don't really feel like you do, brother Biscll. I don't feel such an energy and such a pull." Let me say this. Respect. You have respect for the God that called you. &gt;&gt; Have respect for the channel. Maybe mother, father, or some friend or maybe a minister that brought it to you. Have respect for it. &gt;&gt; And if you will respect it and say it, I know this is you. &gt;&gt; I know this is you. I know that this is supernatural. I know that this is God. I don't feel any particular energy about it, but I I believe that this is Malachi 4. I believe that this is the spirit of Elijah. I believe that that could not come from a man. And start to put it in your log &gt;&gt; and say, "Oh, Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; come and quicken this to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll never shake it. &gt;&gt; You'll never shake it. &gt;&gt; He's born that way. He's shaped that way. And Jacob, &gt;&gt; I don't care what he is. &gt;&gt; He wants that birthright. He's a spiritual one. You might be here and Satan has has beat you on the head and and and said you're not worthy of it and you're weak and you're a failure and you're this and all the rest of it. In spite of all of those things you want to be able to say and declare in your heart. One thing I do know those promises are yay and amen. In spite of my frailties, in spite of my failures, I believe that because I want that birthright. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the spiritual one and them too today is in the womb of the church. There's a great big system trying to be formed called the world council of churches and from the womb of the church is coming forth two children. You just mark my word the world. He said word must deliver the word bride church. The church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for Christ. Do you realize that when he was saying that she had not actually been delivered? &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ has come out of the womb. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it's been a birth pain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me ask another question. How many here were in another faith or another church or another religion or another denomination or another belief before you came to the message? You were in one. You were committed to it. Let me see you raise your hands. All right. And I think of those that raised their hands, no one really was one of those who said, "I was physically here and saw the messenger." But you were in something else. You were in something else. And according to this, this is how literal I take this. You had to be delivered out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You had to be delivered. &gt;&gt; There was no way, brother Joe, for you and the family and brother Sam and brother Henry and brother Eli. No way for you to remain where you were. There was no way that I could remain in the fellowship. I did not belong to a denomination. Never have believed it was wrong. Believed denomination was something that was designed by the devil. That's what we actually believed. It was some system. And of course, I didn't know that we were as right as we were, but that didn't make the message right to me. When the message came, everything else had to fall in line with that. &gt;&gt; I had to be delivered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You had to be delivered. &gt;&gt; And those of you that were just in sin, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; you had to be delivered. &gt;&gt; You had to come out. &gt;&gt; You believe it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And them that fell asleep in all ages will make up that bride that come out on the word &gt;&gt; that they come out on. They in other words, they believe the word of their time like like from your feet coming to your head. She just gets greater &gt;&gt; and more you have to have and so forth. As the body grows up, so does the body of Christ grow up. And then finally, finally, finally, the head will come to it. The head of it all. The head of it all happens to be the mighty angel that he was just talking about. He will come. He's not from the earth. He comes from heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was born of a virgin so he could go to Calvary in a body. And the body perished, died at Calvary, sacrificed for you, but the spirit that was in Christ raised him from the dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not just preaching for my own good here, but I'm I'm feeling very energized about it. &gt;&gt; As the body grows up, he says, "And then finally the head will come to it." &gt;&gt; And I saw another mighty angel come from heaven. It's just different language of the same event. I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven. He said, "Who was it?" It was Christ. &gt;&gt; Who is Christ? He's the head of the body. Why is he coming down? Because the body is on earth. &gt;&gt; It's not a pair of feet that's on earth. &gt;&gt; It's not just a, you know, a part of the limbs on earth. The body's on earth. The body had been it had been shaped up. How did the body came? The same way the body of Jesus Christ came into the womb. All of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets. &gt;&gt; Remember last Sunday and God took the earth, the earth that had been formed up into the bodies of men and they were dying then &gt;&gt; because they were brought up out of a cursed earth. Their mother ate wheat and cabbage and bread and whatever more and fed the baby in the womb and the womb and out of the womb came prophets. Isaiah came out. Jeremiah came out. Elijah came out. Elisha came out. They all came out. But they spoke of the redeemer. &gt;&gt; They spoke of his sufferings. &gt;&gt; David the psalmist spoke of his sufferings. What is it? God's voice coming out of the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. speaking their own redemption. &gt;&gt; And you in bodies of this earth, God has sent a message to you. And out of this cursed earth speaks salvation. You speak of your redemption. &gt;&gt; And God imputes it to you. It's righteousness. &gt;&gt; You confess, I'm redeemed. &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed. I said this morning in prayer, I believe &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; died at Calvary for my sin. &gt;&gt; I believe he hung there. &gt;&gt; And when you believe that, all of your sin was nailed to that tree. &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't any man or woman want that? &gt;&gt; All of my sin, &gt;&gt; all of my sin &gt;&gt; is nailed to that tree. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan's head was crushed. &gt;&gt; And you want to say that to yourself, that enemy is on your trail. &gt;&gt; The hounds of hell will be on your trail. Even when you leave this church, you want to be able to say, "Satan, your head was crushed. &gt;&gt; And I'm celebrating. I'm celebrating this Easter. Your head was crushed. And I believe it. It's in my log. I am muse about that. I muse about that. I think about that. I ponder it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; And God says, "My son, my daughter, &gt;&gt; indeed, &gt;&gt; you have it. &gt;&gt; You have it. &gt;&gt; You have a life that's free &gt;&gt; of Satan's power. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about real things. He's greater than the sickness you may feel this morning. &gt;&gt; If you're sick and afflicted, the one I'm speaking of paid for it at Calvary. And he's greater than your sickness &gt;&gt; or your infirmity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then finally, the head will come. This day is the scripture fulfilled. &gt;&gt; The world is in birth pains now. It was back then when he spoke it in ' 65. It's in birth pains now. The old has to be done away with so the new can be born. Just like a seed has to rot away in order to give new life. And under every prophet's message, Israel got a birth pain because that these prophets would come on the scene after the theologians and clergymen would have the church all in an organizational form. And when them prophets come on the scene with thus saith the Lord, they shook them churches. And she had a birth pain. And finally she gave she finally she had birth pains plum up to until she delivered a son of the gospel which was the word itself made flesh. &gt;&gt; I hope you grasp what he's saying. &gt;&gt; It wasn't only the word made flesh back then but the gospel of Jesus Christ. The word in this hour has become flesh in the bride of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you know what gives me confidence in saying that? You know what gives me such assurance is that he a man, a brother in Christ. &gt;&gt; Who I call my precious brother Brandham as an individual that I can say in our time and you can say in my time. I heard about it this morning. You young people absorb this. Ponder this. Don't ponder some equation now or some something in your mathematics. Ponder this that in my time God sent this kind of a ministry with an infallible proof. &gt;&gt; And I've asked myself I am mused. I said why? &gt;&gt; Oh the answer came because he's a forerunner. &gt;&gt; I am mused further. Why? What was he forerunning? Who was he forerunning? He was forerunning the Messiah, the Christ, the son of God, the bridegroom, my husband. I put it all in the log. He was forunning him &gt;&gt; and further put it in the log. He said he would introduce the bridegroom to the bride &gt;&gt; as as the messenger, the servant introduced Boaz. Boaz said, "Who is this woman in the field?" Who's the field? Jesus said, "The field's the world." Can you imagine this savior Boaz coming and the prophet of God speaking to multitude of people and you weren't even here yet. &gt;&gt; But he said, "There's a bride. &gt;&gt; There is a bride." &gt;&gt; And the word that was coming out of his body would call that bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It called you. &gt;&gt; Put it in your log. Say, "Why did he call me?" Because you are to be the recipient, the beneficiary of what's in the promise. &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is the forerunner to the resurrection. &gt;&gt; This is the forerunning to the rapture. &gt;&gt; All you need to say is, "Here I am, Lord. Bring it on. &gt;&gt; Bring it on. &gt;&gt; We are here. &gt;&gt; We are ready. We're prepared. &gt;&gt; Can you say, "I believe." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe the good report. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory to the Lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel it. You just say you believe it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't look at the impossibilities. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; Sister Violet. We all have them. I have them. &gt;&gt; Brother Gary, Brother Roy, Sister Judy, we all have them. &gt;&gt; We all have them. You say, "Well, I shouldn't name them." Well, he he names you. &gt;&gt; He knows your name. &gt;&gt; He calls your name. They're impossibilities. Brother Vile, Sister Mara, they think they're impossibilities. We will leave the impossibilities behind. Let me ask you, what would they mean if the sweet came before the service was over and you were transformed and changed and walking in another body? What would it mean? What would your studies, what would your future mean if it changed? nothing. &gt;&gt; The man on whose casket I just laid my hand and I spoke a few words concerning him. He was worth tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars. What does it mean to him? &gt;&gt; What it mean to him? I got called on the weekend said his kidneys are shutting down. They gave him a shot and he just went downhill and was gone Tuesday. Could have bought. In fact, is this man bought the Baptist's ho hospital in Amarella, Texas. And I was trying to find out if that happened to be the hospital brother Brandham was in. I hadn't found out yet. He bought the entire hospital in Amarella, Texas, the Baptist hospital. Huge complex going to turn it into a senior citizens home. What does that mean for him? &gt;&gt; Nothing. Nothing. &gt;&gt; What are those big problems that Satan tries to loom up in your make them like mountains in front of you? They're nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're children of the sweep. &gt;&gt; You're children of the change. &gt;&gt; You have received the sign of the resurrection. That's why you're here. You've been following that sign. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, this is spiritual GPS. I'm so amazed with this GPS, &gt;&gt; you know, I can't quite get on to it. I They said, "Well, just push this button. Put this disc in here." Mine's never worked. I tell you what, if I ever followed GPS, I'd be y Calamazoo someplace. But I just so amazed. I was riding somebody riding with the taxi driver and he said, "Where are you going?" He says, "This is we're going to forest lawn." Okay. Keep left. Keep left. I thought my that woman seems that this fellow doesn't even hear it, but she just kept saying it. That's why we keep saying it. &gt;&gt; Keep right. &gt;&gt; Keep right. &gt;&gt; Keep right. Keep believing. That thing say left, left, turn left. At the next exit, turn left. Now turn right quickly. &gt;&gt; I thought it was amazing. She's actually telling us where we're going. &gt;&gt; If GPS can do that, I'll tell you what, there's a prophet in the land that knows where you're going. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We got spiritual GPS. &gt;&gt; Turn the corner here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believed in the trinity at one time and I I believed there was father, son, holy ghost. I couldn't I couldn't put them together. Yeah, there one, but there's three. But I I don't know anyway. It's a mystery. But then I heard the prophet's voice and and the GPS says, "Turn right." &gt;&gt; We're at a corner. Turn right. He's one. &gt;&gt; Then he just explained it. Three offices in one go. said my that simple &gt;&gt; that is so simple and it be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the only way they were baptized I want to be baptized my wife she couldn't you know get she's very precise and one day she decided I am going to read the scripture and I'm going to read every place that they were baptized and I am going to find out how they were baptized. And then she comes to me and she said, "Everyone, everyone is baptized in the name of the Lord, the name of the Lord Jesus, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." I said, "Of course." Well, then then she couldn't wait to be baptized. &gt;&gt; So, we got baptized. &gt;&gt; What about we turn the corner? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then we're all going to come to the one we've been waiting for. &gt;&gt; This is the exit. &gt;&gt; This is the exit. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to hear that? This is the exit. Turn here. We're going to say goodbye world. &gt;&gt; We're going to sing this old world can never hold me. Any moment I'll be gone. You don't even have to be happy. You can just say, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; I believe it. Put it in your log. &gt;&gt; You think I'm just preaching a little sermon? No. I want you to put it in your log &gt;&gt; until she was delivered &gt;&gt; of a word of the gospel. &gt;&gt; That's fine. Hallelujah. I want to I want to sing a song musician. &gt;&gt; This old world &gt;&gt; can never hold me. &gt;&gt; Any moment I'll be gone. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I can think of so many songs that don't know which one to sing first. &gt;&gt; I want to sing about No wonder. No wonder, brother Brenam singing, I just I just feel like traveling on. I feel like traveling on. My heavenly home is bright and fair. I feel like traveling on. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your kind attention and allowing me to express what's on my own heart. Oh, glory to God. It's such a reality. It's so real. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh this old world, let's think to start with. This old world can never hold me. Any moment I'll be gone. Can never hold me anymore. Then I'll be gone. All right. Heat. Oh, my concentration and I have my Oh, I feel like traveling on. I feel like traveling on. My heavenly homely home is bright and fair. I feel like heavenly there. Heat. Heat. Yeah. I feel like it's clear. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. away. I feel like traveling. Oh, I feel like traveling. I feel like therefore we sing this last verse. The Lord has been so good to me. I don't mind saying things that perhaps it makes us vulnerable but I want you to know that you know the men who stand behind the pulpit and the men who preach the gospel of this message. I hear brother Brandham and sometimes it becomes so personal about his own life. It's almost an embarrassing embarrassment to hear him. He he he you know he said how he'd failed and he was down to the front. I was in prayer this morning and the greatness when I think of the greatness and the goodness and the how how the brother Brandham said that God could not in Christ the mystery of God revealed he couldn't make himself known he had to come down in the form of Jesus Christ otherwise we couldn't understand him he said it'd be too mystical it'd be too mysterious is what he said and I'm thinking of that the greatness of God. I'm thinking about the the galaxies in the of the entire creation. And I'm sure you would feel the same. You feel so small. You feel so insignificant. You feel as though you failed. And I just hung my head down on my Bible and I I said, "Lord, yeah, I feel like such a failure." I and then I was just reading which I perhaps if the Lord allows me next Sunday I read the entire part beyond the curtain of time and he said only perfect love &gt;&gt; could enter there &gt;&gt; only perfect love &gt;&gt; could enter there &gt;&gt; and it's Not not it's not what the world has told you or you read about in newspapers or the magazines or whatever. The world knows nothing about this love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only perfect love can enter there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I I feel short on that. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry but I feel short on that. I say, God, I failed you. I've just failed in obtaining this perfect love. It's so deep. It's so beyond me. It's beyond my grasp. It has hung my head on a Bible. And I want you to know that I come to the pulpit with that on my heart today. I said, God, you know, you you just have to speak your word. You have to just say it to the people. But as for me, I know one thing. This is what I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe it. I'll say it to the world. I'll say it to the devils. I say it to anybody. My friends, this is what I believe. This word is what we believe. &gt;&gt; And in spite of any weakness or frailty, that's why I could say that with such such vigor, such faith. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much a person fails. I'm not saying it about you. I'm saying it about myself. It's it's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; It's not how you fail. It's what do you believe. &gt;&gt; I declare I believe this word. &gt;&gt; I believe this message. Just think of it, friends. I wasn't saying it to you. I'm saying it for myself. Vindicated with infallibility. &gt;&gt; Where are you going to find that? &gt;&gt; In the encyclopedia? Never. &gt;&gt; In another church, in a denomination? Never. You won't find it. And who did he do it for? And I begin to put that into my log. &gt;&gt; And when you say, "He did it for me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He did that for me. Great. &gt;&gt; You say it to yourself. He did it for me. &gt;&gt; I'm putting it in my log. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ponder about this. Then you'll realize this last verse. The Lord has been so good to me. I feel like traveling on. Oh, I see. Heat. Heat. Heat. I feel like traveling on. The Lord has been so good to me. I feel like traveling on. Heat. Heat. Heat. Let me hear the young people 25 and under. I feel like all the young people once more. &gt;&gt; Let's hear it now. Sing it to the whole world. Wonderful. Everybody 25 and over. I feel like and I feel like everybody wants and I'm traveling on. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Heavenly Father, our Lord Jesus said that I go to prepare a place for you. Your messenger said it was being prepared then. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said it was a special place designed for the bride of Jesus Christ. And we'll see them from every tribe and every tongue and the nations, our neighbors, our friends, our loved ones, our family. We want to be gathered to that table, oh God. and not only to the table, but then everything that takes place from then on. Prepare us, Lord. You know what needs to be, what we have need of, and what needs to be done. I wonder if while I'm praying, you may want to raise your hands and say, "Brother Ed, include me in this prayer, please." &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh God, I have my hands up. Prepare me. &gt;&gt; Prepare us for this blessed place. prepare us for this place of perfect love. Prepare us, oh God. Oh God, I pray that you will infuse us with the very nature and character of Jesus Christ. That we we may respond and we may speak as you would speak and we may be silent as you would be silent and we may express you. Lord Jesus, what a privilege, what an honor it is for us. Bless this audience of people, oh God, and those that are streaming, those rooms that we have been privileged to enter into and fellowship with the saints in whatever country or place they are. Bless them. Bless them, I pray, oh God, until we meet. Until we meet at this blessed table of the Lord, Jesus, keep us, keep us in the hollow of your hand. Keep us in the sweetness of your Holy Spirit. I pray in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to sing while we're shaking hands some once before we shake hands. Oh love of God, how rich, how pure, how measureless and strong and strong and strong. Oh love, how great. How me and it shall forever in you this. Let's greet one another. Greet one another as we sing, oh lamb of God. My brother Derek from God. How rich and pure, how measureless and strong it shall forever more endure. the saints and angels shall God bless you. I trust you'll be able to take this atmosphere with you and we'll see you this evening. Brother John is going to be speaking and have the Lord's supper after he's done ministering as part of the service. You're dismissed in Jesus name. God bless you. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Oh, heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Glory to you. Good. Good. Heat. Heat.
