but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets brother Brandon um someone wants to know why you were not uh I mean mentioned in the Bible I believe you are HCA 214 get that brother HCA 21-4 let them read this and study it third chapter think name on types of four chapters uh believe I believe is you uh while he's hun it's albeca uh 2 1:4 um uh brother a sister every ask the questions no name that's fine I like to you ask those things I know what's on your heart see and then uh I tell you no see you wouldn't have to necessarily have your name in the Bible see but you see as long as you're in the Bible there as long as you're in Christ you are in the Bible you're in him you see in the Bible see as long as you are in Christ then you are in the fullness of the Bible see you are in your full position when you're in Christ all understand that um do you have it brother Neville what uh hcaa I haven't read it this just put in here I guess this morning uh habca 2 1:4 that's see habca 2 Rebeca 2 and um 1 to4 I will stand up on the watch and set me upon the tower and will watch and see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer I I am when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because I will surely come and I will not t behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in but the just shall live by his faith well uh I'd imagine this dear person that ask this you see it's somebody that loves me or they wouldn't write that see now I could not say my the Bible doesn't call my my name William brandom or call your name whoever it is but we are in him anyhow and these and now you see some familiar places that refer to in the Bible it says certain things see now if you'll watch History repeats itself in the Bible see now let's just give you a scripture for one I see many of writing it down now in third chapter of St Matthew it said and when God called his son out of Egypt that it might be fulfilled which is spoken out of Egypt I call my son now if you got a Scofield or any other reference Bible if you follow that reference there that Marg reading he'll bring you back to where he called Jacob Israel out of Egypt see but Jacob was his son that he called out of Egypt also Jesus was his son that he called out of Egypt so see the word of God is never ending see we identify ourselves in the Bible with different how many remembers my m message on identifying yourself with Christian characters Phoenix Arizona whor preaching yeah many of us got on the tape SC identify with Christian character see you can identify yourself anywhere you want to in that scripture if you are a Christian and if you're not a Christian you can identify yourself in the Bible see so I think maybe that would help
