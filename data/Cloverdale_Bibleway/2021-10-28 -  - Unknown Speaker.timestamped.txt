[24:56] you feed the people father we are hungry
[24:59] people father we don't feed upon what
[25:01] men say we feed upon the word of god so
[25:03] i pray father that you take your word
[25:05] may you transform it into faith and
[25:07] substance into revelation to our souls
[25:09] lord god we commit the hearers and the
[25:11] speaker into your hands for your glory
[25:13] in jesus name we pray amen
[25:17] man let us turn to the word
[25:25] let's go into
[25:27] matthew chapter 16.
[25:44] verse 13 to 14.
[25:49] when jesus came into the coast of
[25:51] caesarea philippi he asked his disciples
[25:54] saying
[25:55] whom do men say i the son of man am
[25:58] and they say some say that our john the
[26:00] baptist
[26:01] some elias and others jeremiah's or one
[26:04] of the prophets
[26:06] let's also turn back to matthew 11 verse
[26:10] 6.
[26:21] and blessed is he
[26:23] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[26:26] amen let's pray
[26:30] heavenly father
[26:32] this is a terrible place to stand
[26:35] the lord we're just
[26:36] following you tonight father
[26:39] i pray o god that you help me tonight
[26:41] that you call my nerves lord as i'm
[26:43] prepared as i may feel lord god but that
[26:45] you can take the word of god and meet
[26:47] the need of your people
[26:48] for it is for the people that will come
[26:50] here tonight lord it's our love for the
[26:52] people to be able to see something that
[26:54] can help somebody love you more that can
[26:56] help somebody know you better lord that
[26:58] can help somebody be edified and
[27:00] establish in a relationship with you
[27:01] that's our desire lord so i pray that
[27:04] you take the word of god that you
[27:05] breathe life into the scriptures or god
[27:08] that we can go back home knowing that
[27:09] you've spoken to us
[27:11] knowing that something of eternal value
[27:13] was deposited in our souls that's our
[27:15] prayer tonight in the name of jesus
[27:17] christ as we read your word
[27:19] it to our hearts bless it make make it
[27:21] come alive in jesus name we pray amen
[27:25] and you have your seeds
[27:37] all right we're going to go straight
[27:38] into the world tonight
[27:40] i don't know how long i'm going to be
[27:41] hopefully not too long
[27:43] i just want to be precise and to achieve
[27:45] the purpose of the goal that i have
[27:46] today and the burden that's on my heart
[27:51] i'm going to start by reading uh brother
[27:53] brown amir makes a statement in god
[27:55] hiding himself in simplicity
[27:57] he says and we know that god is so great
[28:00] till we expect it to be some great
[28:02] something
[28:04] and we miss the simple thing
[28:06] we stumble over simplicity
[28:09] that's how we miss god is by stumbling
[28:12] over simplicity
[28:13] god is so simple until the scholars of
[28:16] these days and all these
[28:18] so he said the scholars of these days
[28:19] and all days
[28:21] miss him a million miles
[28:24] because in their intellect they know
[28:26] that there is something like there's
[28:27] nothing like him so great but in his
[28:30] revelation he makes it so simple
[28:33] that they go plum over the top of it and
[28:36] miss it so prabhupada is saying that the
[28:38] scholars not just in these days so if
[28:40] you could if you can take how god deals
[28:42] with humanity throughout the ages from
[28:44] the old testament to in this day
[28:46] the reason why people miss it
[28:49] is because
[28:50] of their intellect
[28:53] and they miss it because god in his
[28:54] revelation he makes it so simple
[28:58] and
[28:59] just as a disclaimer tonight
[29:02] god cannot be known by intellect let me
[29:04] just stop by saying that laying that
[29:06] down there is absolutely no way god can
[29:09] be known by intellect
[29:12] scholars miss him because of intellect
[29:15] and that's the reason why the pharisees
[29:17] and israel missed him and we understand
[29:19] that through the scripture brotherhood
[29:20] shows that how they were blinded
[29:22] but what what was the reason why they're
[29:24] branded it's not like they had like a
[29:26] spiritual blindfold right
[29:28] but the the reason why they're blinded
[29:30] is because in how god fulfills his word
[29:33] it is so radically different that the
[29:36] intellectual conception
[29:37] that is what blinds with people is when
[29:40] god does something in a way that they do
[29:41] not expect
[29:46] brother one says in recognizing your day
[29:48] and his message
[29:50] he talks about in the days of noah he
[29:51] says they didn't know the day they
[29:53] didn't know
[29:54] that's the reason why they missed it
[29:56] it's because they did not recognize it
[29:58] they were like today he says like
[30:00] somewhat like people today blinded by
[30:03] scientific proofs
[30:05] by educational systems by theological
[30:08] seminaries and things that blinded them
[30:11] in that day it's exactly the same thing
[30:14] today it's blinding them again
[30:16] so seminaries
[30:18] theological
[30:20] scientific proofs is what actually
[30:22] blinds people
[30:24] right so
[30:26] you can you can actually preach the word
[30:28] and god's absolute truth to people
[30:31] if they're looking away from an
[30:32] intellectual point of view if they want
[30:35] everything to be scientifically proven
[30:36] before they believe they will never meet
[30:39] god
[30:40] god can never be known that way and we
[30:42] have to be careful as believers not to
[30:44] fall into this trap to attempt to
[30:47] convince people of god's truth
[30:49] by intellectual reasoning because god's
[30:51] word comes to you by revelation alone
[30:53] [Music]
[30:59] in in
[31:01] chapter 16 of matthew as we just read
[31:06] and i left that one verse on purpose but
[31:07] we're going to go back to it after verse
[31:08] 15. but in verse 13 and 14 what i wanted
[31:10] to show you here
[31:12] especially verse 14 it says some say
[31:15] that our john the baptist
[31:17] some say the true elias
[31:20] and others say that to jeremiah's or one
[31:22] of the prophets
[31:23] some some others right it means that
[31:26] concerning who christ was
[31:29] there wasn't a consensus of opinion
[31:32] concerning who christ was there was a
[31:34] disagreement
[31:36] right and the reason why there's a
[31:38] disagreement because in its nature
[31:40] itself the word of god is controversial
[31:43] and something that's controversial is
[31:45] something that gives or that's likely to
[31:47] give rise to public disagreement
[31:49] it's something that is contentious
[31:52] something that is disputed something
[31:54] that is an issue that's debatable
[31:56] and something that's controversial
[31:58] speaks of an expression of opposing
[32:00] views on a given subject so as you can
[32:03] see here when jesus asked who did who
[32:05] did they say that i am some say some say
[32:09] and others say different opinion about
[32:11] the same person christ because in his
[32:14] nature christ himself is controversial
[32:17] which means that if you bring a subject
[32:19] or it's something that's controversial
[32:20] if you bring a topic in a group of
[32:22] people like tonight and you ask people
[32:24] for their opinion they'll all have
[32:25] different opinions
[32:26] right
[32:28] and what makes something controversial
[32:31] is that
[32:32] there is valid arguments
[32:35] in those pausing views
[32:37] right
[32:38] and if you if you're actually going to
[32:40] search on google as a deal a few a while
[32:43] back about controversial subjects to
[32:45] today
[32:46] in the 21st century even in 2021 and
[32:48] you'll find such as like you know the
[32:50] second amendment you find something like
[32:52] like pro-choice pro-life abortion
[32:56] gay marriage transgender all those
[32:58] issues are issues that are actually
[33:00] controversial issues and the reason why
[33:02] these topics are controversial
[33:06] okay i just started my stop watching now
[33:08] i forgot so i don't know how long i've
[33:10] been
[33:10] but the reason why these issues are
[33:12] controversial is that if you bring
[33:15] people together and ask them to debate
[33:17] on it they have valid arguments on both
[33:19] sides
[33:22] we need oxygen to breathe that's not a
[33:24] controversial issue
[33:26] right like we all agree that oxygen is
[33:28] needed to breathe you can take somebody
[33:31] somewhere in the world who says i don't
[33:32] need oxygen and you can write on every
[33:34] newspaper on the planet nobody will give
[33:36] it any credit but that is not a
[33:39] controversial point of view because
[33:40] generally we all agree that oxygen is
[33:42] needed to breathe
[33:44] so what makes something controversial is
[33:46] that people actually have valid
[33:48] arguments
[33:49] the intellect they have valid reasoning
[33:52] as to why this subject can go either way
[33:57] and another thing that makes something
[33:59] controversial is that the topic in
[34:01] question has high stake right it's
[34:03] something of importance like pro-choice
[34:06] pro-life that's that's something that is
[34:07] very high stake so it is important
[34:09] enough that it is controversial you know
[34:12] if if i prefer apple juice and you
[34:14] prefer orange juice that's not
[34:15] controversial we're not going to have a
[34:17] debate about it right
[34:18] the stakes are not high
[34:20] maybe for you
[34:23] but another thing is that the gap in
[34:25] perspective must be significant so if we
[34:27] slightly disagree it's not really
[34:29] controversial it must be that this is
[34:31] what i believe versus this is what you
[34:33] believe
[34:34] right that is what actually puts
[34:36] somebody or puts the topic as label
[34:38] something that's controversial
[34:40] now breitbart is still showing us that
[34:42] the book of genesis itself is a book of
[34:44] seeds
[34:45] so everything that you find today you
[34:47] have to go back to the book of genesis
[34:49] so we found that the serpent and eve had
[34:52] a radical different view
[34:54] of what the fruit was
[34:57] even knew what god said to do and the
[34:59] serpent said well god didn't say it to
[35:01] do that there is an opposing view about
[35:04] what the fruit was or if they were
[35:06] allowed to have it that was
[35:07] controversial
[35:09] and now even till this day
[35:11] there's a controversy around the
[35:12] original sin
[35:14] we understand that people say well it
[35:15] was fruit and if you follow that raw
[35:17] some say it was an apple an apricot a
[35:20] pear right but some will say that no it
[35:23] was actually a relationship in the
[35:24] garden of eden that was what the
[35:25] original seed is and they don't agree
[35:28] right and serpent seed itself now if
[35:31] you're looking at it from an
[35:32] intellectual point of view it's a
[35:34] controversial subject but to you and
[35:35] it's not because it is revealed
[35:46] so there's three main purposes that i'll
[35:48] try to achieve tonight my title is the
[35:51] word is controversial
[35:53] and for a subject i like to speak on
[35:56] looking beyond the offense
[35:59] three main purposes number one is the
[36:02] word of god is controversial
[36:04] by design and what i mean by design is
[36:07] that it is intentional
[36:09] so there's an intent beyond how the word
[36:12] comes across
[36:14] god intends it to be a specific way so
[36:17] that it all right so that it provokes
[36:19] different opinions about it because god
[36:21] doesn't want people to come to him on
[36:23] the basis of understanding in the mental
[36:26] intellect he wants people to come to
[36:29] them on the basis of revelation
[36:33] number two that we are meant to know god
[36:36] by revelation
[36:38] only not here
[36:40] revelation
[36:43] number three is revelation is sovereign
[36:48] so in matthew chapter 11 verse 6 as we
[36:51] read
[36:52] jesus said blessed is he
[36:54] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[36:57] and i said it's an interesting thing and
[36:59] rabbi picks it up in a forgotten
[37:01] beatitude and he talks about that and he
[37:03] says oh my and blessed is he who's not
[37:06] offended me don't be offended i believe
[37:08] there's more people offended in jesus
[37:09] than any other person that's ever lived
[37:11] on earth
[37:12] think about it
[37:14] right you can think about all the
[37:16] politicians today or all the historical
[37:18] figures that have lived throughout the
[37:20] ages nobody was more offensive
[37:24] than jesus christ
[37:26] people were more offended in jesus
[37:29] than in anybody else who's ever lived
[37:32] and we know that jesus is the word
[37:34] so the word is a reason for offense
[37:37] people are more offended in the word
[37:40] than in any other thing
[37:43] but surprisingly christianity there's
[37:45] 2.5 billion creases on the face of the
[37:48] earth today
[37:50] ask yourself why
[37:52] why is it that back in the days of
[37:54] christ he was rejected he was crucified
[37:58] but today's 2.5 billion can look back
[38:00] and say oh i believe in him he was the
[38:02] son of god that's religion
[38:05] because what has happened is that
[38:06] religion has painted a sunday school
[38:09] version
[38:10] of jesus christ
[38:11] they painted a jesus who loves everyone
[38:14] a jesus whose message is love your
[38:16] neighbor be kind be good be humble and
[38:19] jesus that was persecuted and hated for
[38:21] no reason
[38:22] jesus who was just hating for absolutely
[38:24] no reason he died on the cross for our
[38:27] sins he rose again sent the holy ghost
[38:29] sitting on the throne pleading for our
[38:31] sins every day you can fall and sin all
[38:33] you want he loves you he forgives you
[38:35] all the time
[38:36] this is a palatable version of jesus
[38:38] christ
[38:39] the easiest pill that anybody can
[38:41] swallow today
[38:44] then that's because religion's mandate
[38:47] is to build communities and you can
[38:49] easily build a community on this type of
[38:51] jesus on this historical jesus christ
[38:54] who is love everybody that type of jesus
[38:57] christ that everybody hate him for no
[38:59] reason but actually when look in the
[39:00] scripture there was a valid reason why
[39:02] he was crucified it wasn't just like oh
[39:05] people were so unfair to him no people
[39:07] look at the law of moses and according
[39:09] to the law they had to put him to death
[39:11] so they're hiding the fact that there
[39:12] was a certain element about his ministry
[39:15] that i was offensive
[39:17] and the painting a christ that anybody
[39:19] can love
[39:24] but god's mandate is not to build
[39:25] communities
[39:27] god's mandate is to build a church
[39:29] is to call out a people that they can
[39:31] reveal himself to
[39:33] and brave obama talks about any
[39:34] christian mystery of god reveals that
[39:36] his purpose was to reveal himself
[39:39] god is not interested necessarily in
[39:41] your feelings
[39:43] so god will say something a certain way
[39:46] and you won't care that it's going to
[39:48] offend you because his interest is to
[39:50] reveal himself to you
[39:52] and truth can be offensive sometimes but
[39:55] the predestinated seed can look beyond
[39:58] your face
[39:59] [Applause]
[39:59] [Music]
[40:07] romans chapter 9 we're going to go
[40:08] through a couple of scriptures here
[40:10] verse 31 to 33.
[40:14] paul says but israel which followed
[40:16] after the law of righteousness
[40:19] hath not attained the law of
[40:20] righteousness it says in verse 32
[40:22] wherefore because they sought it not by
[40:25] faith
[40:27] but as it were by the works of the law
[40:30] for they stumbled
[40:32] upon that stumbling stone
[40:34] as it is written behold lay in zion a
[40:38] standing stone and a rock of offense and
[40:41] whosoever shall believe on him shall not
[40:43] be ashamed what is paul saying here is
[40:45] that israel stumbled upon this rock
[40:50] because the scripture had to be
[40:51] fulfilled god laid in zion
[40:53] for a foundation a stone
[40:56] he put a stone inside in zion that is a
[40:58] stumbling stone what does it mean it
[41:00] means if you're a runner and you're
[41:02] running there's something on your way
[41:04] that causes you to stumble and fall
[41:08] and god said i am the one
[41:10] who laid a stumbling stone in zion
[41:13] this is not the devil's doing
[41:15] this is intentional by design god lays a
[41:19] stumbling stone
[41:20] so that when people come and try to run
[41:22] this race if they're not predestinated
[41:25] seed this stumbling stone stops them
[41:27] dead truck in the tracks but you and i
[41:30] we can look beyond the offense you can
[41:33] lay down every stumbling stone
[41:36] we will look beyond each one of them and
[41:38] run this recipe perseverance
[41:45] do not take the offense out of the world
[41:50] do not take the shame that is attached
[41:53] to this gospel outside of the gospel
[41:56] because when you render it without
[41:57] effect you've taken an aspect out of it
[42:00] don't preach jesus that is easy to
[42:02] accept and swallow preach the word
[42:05] exactly the way it is because we are
[42:07] looking for that predestinated sin
[42:10] that can look beyond your face
[42:19] matthew 15
[42:22] verse 10 to 13
[42:24] and he called the multitude and said
[42:26] unto them
[42:28] hear and understand
[42:31] not that which goeth into the mouth
[42:33] defile of a man
[42:35] but that which cometh out of the mouth
[42:36] for the file of a man
[42:39] then came his disciples and said unto
[42:41] him
[42:42] no
[42:43] that the pharisees
[42:45] were offended
[42:46] after they heard this saying
[42:49] but he answered and said
[42:51] every plant
[42:53] which my heavenly father have not
[42:54] planted shall be rooted up
[42:57] so here are the disciples coming to
[42:59] jesus christ and they're saying hey the
[43:01] things that you're preaching don't you
[43:03] know that it's offending people
[43:05] his response was oh really
[43:09] his response was not well maybe i should
[43:11] take part two of the service and make
[43:13] myself a little bit more clear
[43:15] he's responsible no no no that's not
[43:16] what i meant let me actually explain to
[43:18] you let me give you something that's
[43:20] easy to
[43:21] swallow no
[43:22] that wasn't his response
[43:25] his response was
[43:27] through the offense
[43:28] god will root up every plant that he is
[43:31] not planted
[43:34] the disciples saying the pharisees are
[43:36] offended and his answer is that every
[43:38] plant which my father had not planted
[43:41] shall be rooted up
[43:43] the reason why people offended and the
[43:46] reason why the word of god is in such a
[43:48] way to offend people is that god has to
[43:51] unplug every planet that he did not
[43:54] plant
[43:56] we don't want to have a bride of jesus
[43:58] christ that is not a pure bride so god
[44:01] will send off his word and design it
[44:04] intentionally in a certain way so that
[44:07] those who cannot look beyond the offense
[44:09] will be offended and removed
[44:13] and what stays still act
[44:20] matthew chapter 13 verse 54 to 58
[44:25] and when he was come into his own
[44:27] country
[44:28] he taught them in their synagogue in so
[44:30] much that they were astonished
[44:32] and said once at this man his wisdom and
[44:34] this might works
[44:36] it's not this carpenter's son he's not
[44:38] this
[44:39] he's not his mother called mary his
[44:41] brother james and
[44:43] and john and simon and judas and his
[44:45] sisters and they're not all with us
[44:47] once then if this meant all these things
[44:49] verse 57
[44:51] and they were offended
[44:53] in him
[44:55] but jesus said unto them prophet is not
[44:56] without honor saving his own country in
[44:59] his own house
[45:01] they were first astonished by his
[45:03] doctrine by his teaching they were the
[45:05] marvelous they were amazed by it
[45:08] but when they looked at the man
[45:11] christ
[45:12] we know this man
[45:13] we know his parents we know his brothers
[45:16] we know his sisters we know where he
[45:17] grew up now how can this man say these
[45:20] things see what offended them was a
[45:23] human element
[45:25] wasn't the doctrine necessarily though
[45:27] the doctrine can be offensive as you
[45:28] will see but in this verse it's because
[45:31] they look at jesus the man
[45:33] they could not go beyond the man and
[45:36] that was the stumbling block that god
[45:39] almighty veiled himself into a blood
[45:41] cell and came and walked on earth like a
[45:44] human being they could not swallow the
[45:46] fact that almighty god was in that flesh
[45:50] so the human element is what offended
[45:53] them
[45:55] see to not be able to look beyond the
[45:58] human element and see god is to be a
[45:59] pharisee
[46:01] i think i spoke this in victoria i say
[46:02] if you're not able to look past your
[46:05] brother's humanity and flesh you are a
[46:07] pharisee
[46:09] because that is the pharisees is the
[46:10] kunosi garden flesh is stumbled as a
[46:13] human element if you cannot look past
[46:15] the veil and see god you are a pharisee
[46:25] john chapter 6.
[46:28] 51-69
[46:30] actually let's turn to that together
[46:47] i am the living bread starting with
[46:49] verse 51.
[46:54] i am the living bread which came down
[46:55] from heaven
[46:56] if any men eat of this bread
[46:59] shall live forever
[47:00] and the bread that i will give
[47:02] is my flesh which i will give for the
[47:04] life of the world
[47:06] the jews therefore stroke among
[47:08] themselves saying how can this man give
[47:10] us his flesh to eat
[47:12] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[47:14] i say unto you except you eat the flesh
[47:17] of the son of man and drink his blood
[47:20] he shall have no life in you
[47:22] my first he said that he's the living
[47:24] bread
[47:25] and that the bread that he gives is his
[47:28] flesh and the jews the the jews were
[47:30] offended by it and decided thinking how
[47:33] he's gonna give us his flesh
[47:35] instead of making things better he makes
[47:37] things worse
[47:39] right he says
[47:40] verily verily i say unto you except you
[47:42] eat my flesh
[47:44] and drink my blood you have no life in
[47:46] you
[47:47] whosoever eateth my flesh and drink of
[47:49] my blood have eternal life and i will
[47:52] raise him up at the last day for my
[47:53] flesh is meat indeed and my blood is
[47:55] drink indeed he that eaten my flesh and
[47:57] drink up my blood and dwell up in me and
[48:00] i in him as the living father has sent
[48:02] me and i live by the father so he that
[48:05] eat of me even shall live by me
[48:08] this is that bread which came down from
[48:10] heaven not as your fathers did eat manna
[48:12] and are dead he that eateth of this
[48:15] bread shall live forever
[48:18] now it says in verse 60
[48:21] many therefore of his disciples
[48:23] when they had heard this said this is a
[48:26] hard saying who can hear it
[48:29] verse 61 when jesus
[48:31] knew in himself that his disciples
[48:34] murmured at it he said unto them does
[48:36] this offend you
[48:38] what and if you shall see the son of man
[48:40] ascend up where he was before my he's
[48:42] talking about eating is he talking about
[48:44] him being the manna the living bread
[48:46] people offended it says that offends you
[48:48] let me carry on unless you eat my flesh
[48:50] and drink my blood you have no part in
[48:51] me and then the disciples are asking
[48:53] this is a hard thing says are you
[48:55] offended wait until you see the son of
[48:56] man he's just going to say i'm going to
[48:58] offend you more and more and more he's
[49:00] not even trying let me explain
[49:02] everything's better he just keeps on
[49:03] preaching the word
[49:11] and
[49:12] oh i skipped here sorry
[49:20] verse 66
[49:22] from that time many of his disciples
[49:24] went back
[49:26] and walked no more
[49:28] with him
[49:29] then say jesus unto the twelve will you
[49:31] also go away
[49:33] then simon peter answered him lord to
[49:35] whom shall we go
[49:37] thou has the words of eternal life
[49:40] even the disciples that follow jesus
[49:42] christ they got offended by the
[49:45] preaching of the word and christ did not
[49:48] try to make it more palatable for them
[49:49] he didn't try to soften things up
[49:52] for them to swallow it he kept on
[49:54] preaching and preaching and preaching
[49:55] and then the bible says from that time
[49:57] on many disciples no longer work with
[49:59] him why because they could not look
[50:01] beyond the offence
[50:14] let's look into
[50:16] matthew chapter 26
[50:22] verse 31-34
[50:30] or 35 rather
[50:35] then said jesus unto them
[50:37] all these shall be offended because of
[50:40] me this night
[50:42] for it is written i will smite the
[50:43] shepherd and the sheep of the flock
[50:45] shall be scattered abroad
[50:47] but after i am risen again i will go
[50:49] before you into galilee
[50:51] peter answered and said unto him though
[50:53] all men shall be offended because of
[50:54] thee never will i be offended and jesus
[50:57] said unto him verily i say unto you that
[50:59] this night before the cockroach thou
[51:01] shalt deny me thrice peter said unto him
[51:04] though i should die with thee yet will i
[51:06] not deny thee likewise all see all the
[51:08] disciples even jesus is telling his own
[51:11] 12 disciples that left he says even you
[51:14] this very night you'll be offended
[51:16] peter said not me i will never be
[51:18] offended on all the disciples says me
[51:19] neither not me i'll never be offended
[51:21] but they were
[51:24] paul says in first corinthians chapter 1
[51:27] verse 21 to 23 it's a lot of scriptures
[51:29] tonight i just have to lay this down
[51:33] verse 21 of first corinthians chapter
[51:35] one
[51:36] for after that in the wisdom of god the
[51:39] world by wisdom knew not god
[51:41] it pleased god by the foolishness of
[51:43] preaching to save them that belief
[51:46] verse 22 for the jews require a sign and
[51:50] the greeks seek after wisdom
[51:52] but we preach christ crucified
[51:55] unto the jews a stumbling block and unto
[51:58] the greeks foolishness
[52:00] what is paul saying here paul is saying
[52:02] that the jews search after miracles and
[52:05] signs they want to see signs and science
[52:07] the greeks love wisdom which is
[52:08] intellectual reasoning they want to be
[52:10] able to understand and reason and that's
[52:12] why you see in the book of acts when
[52:13] paul wants to the greeks that's all they
[52:14] did is they debated in the debate and
[52:16] debate and reason they want the
[52:17] stimulation of the intellect like oh
[52:20] let's put the scriptures together oh
[52:21] let's step in shadow that's what the
[52:23] greeks wanted but paul said it's not
[52:25] what i wasn't preaching what the jews
[52:26] wanted i didn't prefer the greeks wanted
[52:29] i preached christ crucified
[52:32] and he said to the jews it was a
[52:34] stumbling block
[52:35] and to the greeks it was foolishness so
[52:38] the things that we're preaching and
[52:39] believing to many people it ought to be
[52:42] foolishness and stumbling block we're
[52:44] not believing in the gospel that makes
[52:46] sense
[52:48] we're believing the gospel that is
[52:50] revealed
[52:52] and the reason why it makes scriptural
[52:54] sense to us is by revelation
[52:57] not here if you're an intellectual the
[53:00] only thing you can do the most sensible
[53:02] thing you can do is to reject it and
[53:04] you'll be right
[53:05] because
[53:06] intellect ought to reject the word of
[53:08] god the only thing that can accept god's
[53:11] word is revelation
[53:13] [Applause]
[53:16] as robert obama says that the importance
[53:18] of revelation can never be
[53:19] overemphasized that means on wednesday
[53:22] and sunday and wednesday and sunday we
[53:24] can preach revelation every service we
[53:27] will never over emphasize it because
[53:29] revelation is the only way
[53:32] the only way to know god
[53:35] [Music]
[53:38] if you're believing in the message i'm
[53:39] jumping ahead of myself because somebody
[53:42] put the scriptures together so perfectly
[53:44] that you saw the church ages yeah i see
[53:46] it okay i see every every age has a
[53:48] messenger okay i see brother branham
[53:49] okay i see sons and wonders in the
[53:50] sermon oh yeah he must be perfect i
[53:52] believe oh my you'll be deceived
[53:55] because what anchors the soul of a
[53:57] believer is revelation
[54:00] the word and the message of your day has
[54:02] to come to you by divine revelation
[54:05] if it doesn't come that way
[54:07] after five years after 10 years after 40
[54:10] for some you'll find yourself back why
[54:13] because intellectual reasoning will fail
[54:16] sons and wonders are not going to hold
[54:17] you forever but revelation
[54:20] upon this rock i will build my church
[54:22] and the death of help can never prevail
[54:25] against revelation
[54:27] it will prevail against your
[54:28] intellectual understanding it will
[54:30] provide you some mental conception and
[54:31] understanding it will provide just your
[54:33] signs and your wonders and your
[54:34] discernment but it will never prevail i
[54:37] got something that god from heaven
[54:39] deposited in your soul
[54:41] [Applause]
[54:42] oh my that is why sometimes even when
[54:44] things go hard in life and you ask
[54:46] yourself maybe i'm deceived why am i
[54:48] doing this why am i in this message like
[54:50] i'm just gonna leave it but something in
[54:52] your soul
[54:53] holds you firm
[54:54] because what calls you is divine
[54:57] revelation
[55:01] hallelujah
[55:02] all brothers and sisters i cannot
[55:04] emphasize on this you need this message
[55:07] to become a personal revelation to you
[55:10] [Applause]
[55:11] [Music]
[55:22] now the word offend has read in matthew
[55:25] 11 verse 6 blessed is yours not offended
[55:27] to me
[55:28] it means scandal israel that's
[55:31] right there which means a scandal
[55:35] which means it's a stumbling block
[55:37] or an impediment
[55:39] in the way
[55:41] to cause somebody to trip and fall
[55:44] it causes a person
[55:46] to begin to distrust
[55:49] and desert one whom they ought to trust
[55:51] and obey
[55:53] it causes somebody
[55:54] to find in him something that you
[55:57] disapprove and it hinders you from
[55:59] acknowledging his authority think about
[56:02] it
[56:03] so
[56:04] because christ is in offense
[56:06] people found in him something
[56:08] that they could not approve of
[56:11] and it's the thing that they found in
[56:12] the word and i'll say in the message of
[56:15] the day
[56:16] is what they found in the message that
[56:18] they could not approve of
[56:20] and it hindered them from acknowledging
[56:23] the authority of the world
[56:26] it means that there was a stumbling
[56:27] block something that was put on the way
[56:30] to make them trip and fall
[56:36] it's by design
[56:38] intentional
[56:39] people will come and believe the word of
[56:41] the hour
[56:43] believe intellectually they will
[56:45] understand it they will follow it for a
[56:47] year for five years for 10 years but
[56:49] soon enough for some maybe 50 years
[56:52] they'll even preach the message for 40
[56:54] years some of them but one day they will
[56:57] find something in the message or in the
[57:00] messenger
[57:01] that they disapprove of and because they
[57:04] found that thing they can no longer
[57:06] accept the authority of the word and god
[57:09] said yeah i put that in there for you i
[57:12] put that in the world so that one day
[57:14] you will be offended and you will live
[57:16] it because i've designed my word in such
[57:18] a way that my predecessor sin can never
[57:22] be offended
[57:23] not in the word and not in a messenger
[57:25] [Applause]
[57:29] if you're going to believe the word of
[57:30] god for your day you're going to have to
[57:32] accept and all to the shame
[57:35] that comes with it
[57:36] that's what it is
[57:38] if you call us of a disciple of jesus
[57:40] christ you have to own to what jesus
[57:42] christ says you've made you're walking

[58:44] with believing in god's word
[58:47] don't try to change it own up to it
[58:49] embrace it
[58:51] you could not preach the cross of christ
[58:53] without preaching

[59:32] man who's asking people to actually eat
[59:35] his flesh and drink his blood
[59:37] yup
[59:39] it wasn't about well to be fair he never
[59:41] quite really explained it maybe give him
[59:44] another chance come to the next service
[59:46] my message it will be clear
[59:48] own up to it is that what he said if you
[59:50] say that i believe it
[59:51] [Applause]
[59:52] because in you the predestination see it
[59:55] there is nothing to be offended
[59:58] oh my hallelujah i'm thankful tonight
[1:00:01] that god has placed something in me that
[1:00:03] can look beyond your face others will
[1:00:05] look at something and stumble i'll look
[1:00:07] at him like nope doesn't bother me
[1:00:09] somebody will look at something else and
[1:00:11] stumble and fall i look at me it doesn't
[1:00:12] bother me at all and i'll keep walking
[1:00:15] or fest up to offense and i'll keep
[1:00:17] walking i want you to explain it i want
[1:00:19] you to understand anything all i know is
[1:00:21] that god revealed it to me
[1:00:23] [Applause]
[1:00:26] i can't walk away from something that
[1:00:28] god made real to me i can't you can't
[1:00:30] that is why even when you backslide and
[1:00:32] you go back to nowhere for years and
[1:00:33] years and years no matter what the devil
[1:00:35] says if this message was ever to ever
[1:00:38] reveal to you once
[1:00:40] once
[1:00:41] soon enough one day something will start
[1:00:43] to turn into your heart something's up
[1:00:45] quicker than you it's time to go back
[1:00:48] it's time to go back because i know that
[1:00:50] i've left it but something tells me that
[1:00:52] that is where i belong
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:00:57] [Applause]
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:03] hallelujah
[1:01:05] i remember
[1:01:06] in the last few days
[1:01:08] i had come to a point where there's so
[1:01:11] many scriptural discussion with people
[1:01:13] augustine the prophet and malachi 4 and
[1:01:16] like oh no that's for israel no it's for
[1:01:17] the jews oh nice for the gentiles then
[1:01:19] you go to the church ages and
[1:01:21] i found that even though i had very very
[1:01:24] good valid arguments a lot of people
[1:01:26] just couldn't get it
[1:01:28] and then you can go back home like okay
[1:01:29] i'm gonna put something together and i'm
[1:01:31] gonna lay down so perfectly they won't
[1:01:34] be able to argue so you go back and you
[1:01:36] come and you lay down so perfectly types
[1:01:39] shadows scriptures old testament new
[1:01:41] testament boom you gotta believe like i
[1:01:44] don't see it like how
[1:01:46] how
[1:01:48] then one day i was praying and the lord
[1:01:50] spoke to me and said you to stop
[1:01:51] speaking to the mind speak to your souls
[1:01:54] and i was like wait a minute
[1:01:56] that's it because if i speak to the mind
[1:01:58] they will respond from an intellectual
[1:02:00] point of view and then we have
[1:02:01] disagreements and we'll just clash but
[1:02:03] if i cannot speak it to be true if
[1:02:05] they're predestinated seed there is
[1:02:08] something in their soul
[1:02:10] that even if it doesn't make sense here
[1:02:12] it's quickened here
[1:02:14] and that's what i said to him like i'm
[1:02:15] going to tell you what god has done in
[1:02:17] this age because brother branham says
[1:02:19] that the elective of god can see the
[1:02:22] light of their day
[1:02:24] so i'm going to tell you what the light
[1:02:26] is if there's a seed in you when that
[1:02:28] light flashes it will strike that seed
[1:02:31] even if you don't understand it here
[1:02:33] either
[1:02:34] if somebody stretch you'll see that it
[1:02:36] comes alive
[1:02:38] try to stop it you can't
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:44] sorry
[1:02:45] i'm just down with explanations and
[1:02:47] debates i'll just preach to you what
[1:02:49] brother bonham said i'll preach what god
[1:02:51] is doing this age if you're
[1:02:53] predestinated you will see it you might
[1:02:55] argue here you might fight it for a
[1:02:57] little bit but once it's quickened
[1:03:00] even if you cannot resolve it here you
[1:03:02] cannot get away from something that's
[1:03:03] done here and that's how i believe it
[1:03:07] [Applause]
[1:03:11] i remember once uh
[1:03:12] somebody asked brother stephen was in
[1:03:14] nigeria to ask him why isn't speaking in
[1:03:16] tongues the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:03:18] and you've heard the testimony and i was
[1:03:20] waiting for stephen to maybe you know go
[1:03:22] in the scriptures and i didn't know
[1:03:23] where he was going to go
[1:03:24] he looked at the person and said i'm not
[1:03:26] going to give you any scripture
[1:03:28] the reason why it is not the edness of
[1:03:30] the holy ghost is because god's prophet
[1:03:32] in this day has said it's not
[1:03:36] go solo that
[1:03:38] that's how i believe it i if brother
[1:03:40] branham said it i will stand by it and i
[1:03:42] would say it exactly like you said
[1:03:44] even it doesn't make sense to me here
[1:03:47] all i know is that i believe
[1:03:50] that's all i know is i believe
[1:03:58] we're going to continue talking about
[1:04:00] the ministry of jesus christ now as i
[1:04:02] said people have painted uh
[1:04:04] a sunday school version of jesus christ
[1:04:06] but do you actually know when i was
[1:04:07] doing some search in history that there
[1:04:09] was
[1:04:10] there is a group of people even till
[1:04:11] this day
[1:04:12] that believe that
[1:04:14] jesus christ has some mental health
[1:04:15] issues
[1:04:16] and i'm saying that very respectfully
[1:04:18] it's the lord that we're talking about
[1:04:20] but i just want to show you something
[1:04:22] in john chapter 7 verse 16 to 20
[1:04:26] i'll actually just jump to verse 20. it
[1:04:27] says the people answered and said
[1:04:30] thou has the devil
[1:04:31] who goeth about to kill you
[1:04:34] so jesus is talking about you know the
[1:04:36] son of man will be killed you seek to
[1:04:38] kill me and you're like nobody's trying
[1:04:40] to kill you
[1:04:42] like you you're paranoid like check
[1:04:44] yourself man something's significantly
[1:04:45] wrong with you
[1:04:47] and psychiatry say that he he shows sign
[1:04:49] of paranoia multiple times is that he
[1:04:51] was always feeling that somebody was to
[1:04:53] get him somebody was going to betray him
[1:04:56] somebody was going to kill him he was
[1:04:57] constantly feeling threatened and
[1:04:58] they're like yeah that fits the personal
[1:05:00] paranoia
[1:05:01] this man
[1:05:03] better going to mental institution
[1:05:05] now you're a believer of jesus in those
[1:05:07] days and that is the man that you're
[1:05:08] following and the rumors in your town is
[1:05:11] that you're following a man who ought to
[1:05:13] be a mental institution does that sound
[1:05:14] like jesus easy to follow today
[1:05:16] right put yourself in those days so the
[1:05:18] reason why the disciples really followed
[1:05:20] him till the end predestinated seed
[1:05:24] that's the only way
[1:05:26] if you're honest pharisee the only
[1:05:28] conclusion you can come to is crucified
[1:05:30] jesus because right here everything he
[1:05:32] does here contradicts the bible the old
[1:05:35] testament everything he does is against
[1:05:37] reason
[1:05:38] everything is against everything you
[1:05:40] stand for so what are you gonna do
[1:05:42] crucify him it's the logical conclusion
[1:05:44] but if you're predestinated you can look
[1:05:47] beyond the offense you can bypass your
[1:05:49] reasoning you can bypass your own fears
[1:05:51] you can bypass your own reasoning
[1:05:53] because you are hooked
[1:05:56] [Applause]
[1:05:56] [Music]
[1:06:05] mark chapter 3 verse 21
[1:06:08] and when his friends heard of it
[1:06:11] they went out to lay hold of him for
[1:06:14] they said he is beside
[1:06:16] himself and the scribes which came down
[1:06:19] from jerusalem
[1:06:21] say he hath bails above and by the
[1:06:23] priests of the devil scarcity of the
[1:06:25] devils
[1:06:26] think about it
[1:06:28] not his enemies his friends
[1:06:30] those who knew jesus
[1:06:32] his friends when they heard the things
[1:06:34] he was saying the bible says they came
[1:06:36] to lay ahold of him in other words they
[1:06:37] came to restrain him
[1:06:39] to retain him
[1:06:42] because they say he is beside himself do
[1:06:44] you know what that means it means he's
[1:06:46] crazy
[1:06:47] he's mentally insane
[1:06:49] these are his friends
[1:06:51] right you'll be like miss tonight i'm
[1:06:53] speak speaking and i say something and
[1:06:55] brother see my brother brother marcus
[1:06:56] has come like oh we apologize we're
[1:06:58] sorry like
[1:07:00] brothers
[1:07:00] it's okay let's go let's go to the back
[1:07:02] so something's wrong with brother john
[1:07:04] yeah like so he's really something has
[1:07:06] gone really wrong that's exactly what
[1:07:07] the scripture is saying
[1:07:08] while jesus is speaking his friends
[1:07:11] not his enemies his friends come to like
[1:07:13] okay well it's time to go now let's get
[1:07:15] ahold of him because he's beside himself
[1:07:17] i don't know what's wrong with him
[1:07:18] usually he's not like this usually he
[1:07:19] doesn't say things like that like
[1:07:21] okay it's time to go that is jesus
[1:07:24] that they're following
[1:07:26] is that's your sunday school jesus
[1:07:28] that's easy to swallow today no
[1:07:33] john chapter 10
[1:07:35] verse 19 and verse 20. there was a
[1:07:38] division therefore again against the
[1:07:39] jews for he sayings
[1:07:41] and many of them said he has a devil and
[1:07:44] he is mad why hear him
[1:07:47] the amplified version says
[1:07:49] there is a division of opinion
[1:07:51] among the jews because of the words of
[1:07:53] jesus and many of them said he has a
[1:07:55] demon and he is insane he raves and
[1:07:59] rambles
[1:08:00] do you know what that means it means to
[1:08:01] talk widely and incurrently as if one is
[1:08:05] delirious or
[1:08:08] insane to talk or write at length in the
[1:08:11] confused way
[1:08:13] when they're hearing jesus
[1:08:15] speak you're like this man poor guy
[1:08:18] something has gone really really wrong
[1:08:20] with him
[1:08:21] maybe it's time to call dr rabbi to take
[1:08:24] him to his psychiatric institution let's
[1:08:26] do some damage control here this is
[1:08:28] jesus
[1:08:31] god didn't send a son of god that was
[1:08:33] just so perfectly acceptable by everyone
[1:08:36] no he let him be a certain way he let
[1:08:39] him say things a certain way he let him
[1:08:41] act a certain way so that this can
[1:08:43] happen
[1:08:46] some say that jesus had a savior's
[1:08:48] complex
[1:08:49] which is a state of mind in which an
[1:08:51] individual holds a belief that they were
[1:08:52] destined to become a savior
[1:08:55] so if you're listening to jesus talking
[1:08:56] about saving you might not giving his
[1:08:58] life and you have just attended
[1:09:00] jerusalem university and the classroom
[1:09:02] psychiatry the talking of the savior's
[1:09:03] complex this individual exhibit this
[1:09:06] type of science and then you go to a
[1:09:07] meeting and jesus is preaching and you
[1:09:09] hear what jesus is saying tends to fit
[1:09:12] the description of that electoral
[1:09:14] university what are you gonna do
[1:09:18] if the shoe fits right you're like oh i
[1:09:20] just i just heard about it in school
[1:09:22] perhaps somebody went to andrew i was in
[1:09:24] class look look at my notes this thing
[1:09:26] that jesus is telling we talked about it
[1:09:28] at university these are sons of somebody
[1:09:30] who has a savior's complex you want to
[1:09:32] stay away from that man
[1:09:36] andrew will say man i don't know
[1:09:38] it seems like you're right but i just i
[1:09:39] just can't get away from this man
[1:09:41] i just can't do it i can't like even
[1:09:43] myself i i did some research yeah you
[1:09:46] have a point i've seen it too don't
[1:09:48] worry about it i've seen it but like
[1:09:49] even one day i decided you know what i'm
[1:09:50] not gonna fall in but something in me
[1:09:52] said you gotta keep following him i
[1:09:54] cannot explain it yeah maybe i'm
[1:09:56] deceived maybe i am
[1:09:58] that's how it is to follow jesus
[1:10:03] they talk about paranoia it's an instant
[1:10:05] or thought process that is believed to
[1:10:07] be heavily influenced by anxiety and
[1:10:09] fear
[1:10:10] so to people jesus was constantly
[1:10:12] anxious
[1:10:14] he was constantly living in fear that
[1:10:16] somebody was out there together
[1:10:18] that is the jesus that they followed
[1:10:21] now today people wanted jesus but
[1:10:23] everybody can be so proud of like here's
[1:10:25] my friend jesus i follow him and be like
[1:10:27] oh i've heard so much about you oh what
[1:10:29] a wonderful man no if you're a disciple
[1:10:32] of jesus
[1:10:33] with your discipleship comes rumors
[1:10:36] mockeries shame
[1:10:39] offense all you have to do is say i
[1:10:41] believe don't try to explain it don't
[1:10:43] even try to excuse it
[1:10:46] own it
[1:10:50] now there's three categories of people
[1:10:52] that follow jesus can bring up the
[1:10:53] slideshow
[1:10:55] i'm gonna drive this home now
[1:11:00] the first slide
[1:11:08] can you see it
[1:11:09] not the title the next slide
[1:11:17] all right so there's people who followed
[1:11:19] jesus because it's all signs and wonders
[1:11:22] and i'll show you the scripture very
[1:11:23] quickly because i'm running out of time
[1:11:26] there's people that follow jesus because
[1:11:28] they have an understanding of the
[1:11:29] scriptures mentally
[1:11:32] but there's people who actually have
[1:11:34] revelation
[1:11:35] next slide
[1:11:37] and we understand but i going to show
[1:11:39] that judas
[1:11:40] had signs and wonders he saw them and he
[1:11:42] actually manifested them
[1:11:44] and judas preached the word he had the
[1:11:45] intellectual understanding of the
[1:11:46] scriptures and he preached the message
[1:11:49] but judah said no revelation
[1:11:52] next slide oh we're going for that so
[1:11:55] medication check
[1:11:57] there you go so
[1:12:00] your signs and wonders what you see
[1:12:02] is what you see with your flesh your
[1:12:04] eyes your ears and what you hear right
[1:12:06] that is what is attracting you
[1:12:09] and then in your spirit realm doesn't
[1:12:11] need to let you understand what i'm
[1:12:12] going to cause intellectual faith so
[1:12:14] when we're preaching the word you'll
[1:12:16] hear it to your ears in your body you'll
[1:12:18] that into your spirit one man you
[1:12:20] said making sense of it in your mind but
[1:12:21] then the next step is down in your soul
[1:12:24] god turns that word into revelation
[1:12:29] very quickly here in john chapter 2
[1:12:31] verse 23
[1:12:33] now when he was in jerusalem in the
[1:12:34] passover in the feast day many believe
[1:12:36] in his name when they saw the miracles
[1:12:39] that's why they believe that's other
[1:12:40] miracles
[1:12:42] in john chapter 10 verse 41 and 42
[1:12:44] many resorted unto him and say john did
[1:12:47] no miracle but all these things that
[1:12:48] john speak of this man were true and
[1:12:50] merely believed on him there
[1:12:53] matthew 7 verse 28 and it came to pass
[1:12:55] when jesus said ended this thing the
[1:12:57] people were astonished at his doctrine
[1:12:59] and they believed luke 4 32 and they
[1:13:01] were astonished at this doctrine for his
[1:13:02] word was with power mark 1 222 and they
[1:13:04] were astonished at his doctrine there's
[1:13:06] people who heard jesus christ and follow
[1:13:08] him because of the signs that people
[1:13:09] heard it because the doctrine sounded
[1:13:10] good they were astonished by it and
[1:13:12] follow him body spirit
[1:13:16] but the bible says in james chapter 2
[1:13:18] verse 19 god believes that there is one
[1:13:20] god
[1:13:21] that does well the devils also believe
[1:13:24] and tremble
[1:13:25] what belief is that right here
[1:13:28] the devil doesn't have a revelation
[1:13:34] now
[1:13:35] i'm going to skip this part but i was i
[1:13:37] was going to show you quickly here
[1:13:39] how many people actually have issues
[1:13:41] believing in the bible because
[1:13:43] the way the scriptures are panned out in
[1:13:45] a way that challenges your mental
[1:13:47] intellect and it makes it hard to
[1:13:48] actually reconcile these things and i'll
[1:13:50] give you an example
[1:13:51] god sent a prophet to david and to talk
[1:13:54] to me about to threaten him about
[1:13:56] years of famine
[1:13:57] in samuel chapter 2 or 24 verse 13 talks
[1:14:00] about seven years of famine and first
[1:14:02] chronicles 21 talks about three years of
[1:14:03] famine
[1:14:05] so how many pairs of clean animals god
[1:14:07] told noah to take into the ark genesis 6
[1:14:09] 19 says 2 genesis 7 verse 2 says 7. and
[1:14:14] who was the father of joseph the husband
[1:14:16] of mary well matthew 1 16 says it was
[1:14:19] joseph uh and another chapter verse
[1:14:23] chapter 3 verse 23 say it was hell
[1:14:25] matthew 1 16 and luke 3 23.
[1:14:29] when you look at the general of jesus
[1:14:30] christ matthew places him as a
[1:14:31] descendant of solomon son of david
[1:14:33] but luke prism is the son of nathan son
[1:14:36] of david
[1:14:38] now i'm not going to go through this
[1:14:39] book for the sake of time there's
[1:14:40] multiple scriptures and people will look
[1:14:42] at those scriptures and they will be
[1:14:43] like i can't see this bible this bible
[1:14:46] is not consistent this bible is this is
[1:14:48] bible that and brother banham says this
[1:14:57] in pride he says the holy spirit wrote
[1:15:00] the bible
[1:15:01] and is written in such a way that there
[1:15:04] is no way at all for men in his mental
[1:15:07] conception to understand what it is
[1:15:11] no matter how well you got it wrote out
[1:15:13] no matter how well you can put it
[1:15:15] together it is wrong to begin with see
[1:15:17] because it's hid from the eyes of the
[1:15:20] wise and prudent and it's a spiritual
[1:15:22] revelation
[1:15:23] he's saying that the bible is written in
[1:15:24] a certain way on purpose
[1:15:27] by design
[1:15:28] intention intentionally so that as if
[1:15:31] somebody is looking at the word from an
[1:15:33] intellectual standpoint he won't believe
[1:15:37] that is the part of the word from noah
[1:15:40] to moses to jeremiah to daniel to jesus
[1:15:43] to paul to brother branham the word is
[1:15:46] comes out in a certain way on purpose so
[1:15:50] that those who play those tapes and read
[1:15:52] those books from a mental point of view
[1:15:54] they can never see it they might
[1:15:56] sympathize and follow it for a while but
[1:15:58] they will never see it because god
[1:16:00] designs his word that way on purpose
[1:16:08] so the word creates a conflict between
[1:16:10] faith and reasoning
[1:16:12] things are said
[1:16:14] events take place scriptures are panned
[1:16:16] out in a certain way on purpose to
[1:16:18] create a radical conflict
[1:16:20] between spiritual revelation and
[1:16:22] intellect
[1:16:23] that way when the believer must
[1:16:25] willingly
[1:16:26] remove from his foundation
[1:16:28] everything else that is not divine
[1:16:30] substance
[1:16:31] because of only foundation that is safe
[1:16:34] secure and everlasting is revelation so
[1:16:38] if you've come to the message because
[1:16:39] you heard about the discernments and the
[1:16:41] healings and the diet being raised
[1:16:42] that's all good we need that
[1:16:44] or you've come because you've never
[1:16:46] understood the trinity you never agree
[1:16:48] with me and you see oh brother also
[1:16:49] doesn't agree with you like yeah it
[1:16:50] makes sense i don't believe in the
[1:16:51] trinity that's also fine
[1:16:53] but if that is your foundation
[1:16:55] god will allow things he will allow
[1:16:57] events to come by your way he will bring
[1:17:00] bring forth a win that will shake
[1:17:02] everybody that you trust
[1:17:03] until from your foundation
[1:17:05] nothing is left but revelation
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:12] a wise man builds builds his house on
[1:17:14] the rock right right
[1:17:17] says in indictment
[1:17:20] paragraph 2 22 it says loving doctrine
[1:17:22] of men make denominations and dogmas
[1:17:24] better than they do the vindicated word
[1:17:26] of god
[1:17:27] say this generation of people
[1:17:29] this narration expands god's revelation
[1:17:33] in other words they reject with disdain
[1:17:35] and content
[1:17:36] so contempt talks about the feeling that
[1:17:38] a person or a thing is beneath
[1:17:40] consideration worthless or deserves no
[1:17:43] attention at all
[1:17:44] something that shouldn't be taken into
[1:17:46] account but it's disregarded what is
[1:17:48] probably what i'm saying we're living in
[1:17:49] a time where revelation doesn't matter
[1:17:52] anymore
[1:17:54] that is why he's saying that it can
[1:17:56] never be over emphasized because this
[1:17:58] world that you're living in to the
[1:18:00] religious world revelation is of no
[1:18:02] effect it doesn't matter to them all
[1:18:04] they want is to paint a jesus christ
[1:18:06] that died 2000 years ago and that
[1:18:08] retired and is sitting on the throne
[1:18:10] where's jesus christ sent back to the
[1:18:11] holy ghost and he carried on in every
[1:18:13] single day he said the word of your day
[1:18:16] till this day he sent a prophet and he
[1:18:17] sent a message god doesn't work that way
[1:18:21] this generation spreads revelation
[1:18:23] they take it out of because to them it
[1:18:25] doesn't matter
[1:18:31] how did abel
[1:18:32] know what to do in order to offer a
[1:18:34] proper sacrifice god
[1:18:36] by faith he received the revelation of
[1:18:38] the blood
[1:18:40] cain didn't get such a revelation baron
[1:18:43] says this in in the church book
[1:18:44] revelation of jesus christ and i love
[1:18:46] this cain didn't get such a revelation
[1:18:48] even though he had a commandment
[1:18:51] so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice
[1:18:53] so we know that god comes to cain and
[1:18:54] says if you do like your brother you'll
[1:18:55] be accepted which is a commandment even
[1:18:57] though he had a commandment he could
[1:18:59] never get that revelation
[1:19:05] in matthew chapter
[1:19:06] 16 where we read in the beginning and i
[1:19:08] left out verse 15 and 16.
[1:19:10] jesus said
[1:19:12] who
[1:19:13] by who say he that i am and simon peter
[1:19:15] answered and said thou are the christ
[1:19:18] the son of the living god
[1:19:20] right and jesus said flesh and blood did
[1:19:23] not reveal this to you but my father who
[1:19:25] is in heaven reveals this to you
[1:19:28] now i want to show you something that's
[1:19:30] very remarkable to me at least
[1:19:33] in john chapter 1 41
[1:19:37] i want him to go to it but andrew comes
[1:19:39] and calls peter and says come see this
[1:19:41] man that we found
[1:19:42] he is the christ
[1:19:45] so there was a certain point in peter's
[1:19:47] walk where he followed jesus because
[1:19:48] andrew told him that jesus is the christ
[1:19:52] but here
[1:19:53] in matthew 16
[1:19:55] jesus tells us flesh and blood didn't
[1:19:58] reveal this you
[1:19:59] so peter's understanding by intellect
[1:20:01] because his brother andrew told him
[1:20:04] there is a pawn in his walk with jesus
[1:20:06] where that intellectual understanding
[1:20:08] became divine revelation and jesus said
[1:20:12] flesh and blood
[1:20:13] this is not an angel who told you this
[1:20:15] what i'm hearing now
[1:20:17] is coming directly from my father this
[1:20:19] is a revelation so perhaps you come
[1:20:22] because you understand the word that's
[1:20:23] fine but at some point in your work that
[1:20:26] mental understanding must become divine
[1:20:29] revelation
[1:20:36] the church is built on revelation but
[1:20:38] i'm going to say but you see the whole
[1:20:39] secret is the revelation that's where
[1:20:42] the trouble is people don't understand
[1:20:43] that the whole church of the living god
[1:20:45] is built upon spiritual revelation
[1:20:52] i'm just going to lay down a few quotes
[1:20:53] here on revelation
[1:20:55] problem who says
[1:20:57] the revelation of every word of god is
[1:20:59] true
[1:21:00] hang your soul on any phase of it
[1:21:03] revelation
[1:21:05] what does our soul hang on
[1:21:07] revelation that means if our soul was
[1:21:09] hanging and there was a glove beneath us
[1:21:11] of hell and burning fire and the only
[1:21:13] thread by which our soul was hanging was
[1:21:16] revelation you're secure
[1:21:18] you're safe that is what you need to
[1:21:20] hang your soul on revelation perhaps one
[1:21:23] day you'll be challenged by somebody
[1:21:24] show me the bible why you believe that
[1:21:26] and you can't do it maybe you go
[1:21:28] scripture after scripture and for every
[1:21:30] scripture they have another scripture
[1:21:31] you ought to say that is fine it's
[1:21:34] revealed to me
[1:21:35] [Applause]
[1:21:37] that's good enough
[1:21:38] that's all that matters
[1:21:44] oh i love this quote
[1:21:46] god's provided a way of healing now we
[1:21:48] can preach the word and explain the word
[1:21:52] but you have to receive the word oh
[1:21:54] hallelujah he says that's what sets it
[1:21:56] on fire brother when you receive the
[1:21:58] revelation
[1:22:00] something slips out of the unseen world
[1:22:03] yonder
[1:22:04] comes rolling down through a mystical
[1:22:07] channel somewhere into your soul
[1:22:10] it says now i see it
[1:22:13] your eyes brighten your lips that hung
[1:22:16] down straighten up and smile
[1:22:19] every muscle in your body seems to
[1:22:20] rejoice
[1:22:22] because something is going to happen
[1:22:24] there
[1:22:25] oh hallelujah
[1:22:27] when something comes out over brother
[1:22:29] says out of the eternality out of the
[1:22:32] eternal realm something begins to happen
[1:22:35] and through a mystical channel straight
[1:22:38] down into your soul
[1:22:39] god drops the revelation
[1:22:42] and your eyes are enlightened
[1:22:44] i can't see it
[1:22:46] oh brother team i think that's what
[1:22:47] jonathan had last wednesday when he ate
[1:22:50] of that honey he's also enlightened what
[1:22:53] happened in the eternal realm something
[1:22:56] came down in his soul and he began to
[1:22:58] smile and say if the people out of this
[1:23:01] honey
[1:23:02] they would have possessed the land by
[1:23:04] now
[1:23:04] if the people had this revelation
[1:23:09] oh hallelujah
[1:23:11] that is what is happening tonight in
[1:23:13] this service i pray that out of the
[1:23:15] eternity god will begin to open the
[1:23:17] channel and it's a mystical channel when
[1:23:20] god reveals something to you it's
[1:23:22] personal as i'm preaching this word god
[1:23:25] can be communicating with somebody
[1:23:27] one-on-one and nobody else knows
[1:23:29] anything about it because divine
[1:23:31] revelation comes into a channel directly
[1:23:34] into your soul
[1:23:36] and nobody else knows it's happening
[1:23:38] hallelujah
[1:23:41] hallelujah
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:46] brother says the kingdom of god
[1:23:48] is established in the heart and soul of
[1:23:50] a man
[1:23:52] by a revelation
[1:23:54] of jesus christ
[1:23:59] you don't expect to know god by
[1:24:01] educational theology
[1:24:02] you know god
[1:24:04] by being born again
[1:24:05] new birth
[1:24:06] since the holy spirit wrote to the word
[1:24:08] of god
[1:24:09] he so entangled it in there oh my
[1:24:13] he so entangled the word and said i have
[1:24:16] hid
[1:24:17] it from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:24:19] because it has to be revealed to babes
[1:24:21] such as we'll learn
[1:24:23] the word of god god on purpose took the
[1:24:25] scriptures he took the word he took the
[1:24:27] message and he tangled in such a way
[1:24:30] that if you come by understanding
[1:24:32] intellectually you can see it
[1:24:35] i'm sorry you won't be able to see it
[1:24:37] don't be offended when the people that
[1:24:38] you want trusted have let what you
[1:24:40] believe
[1:24:41] it's not their fault they just couldn't
[1:24:43] see it because god entangled in such a
[1:24:45] way on purpose
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:52] 15 minutes i'm gonna drive this home now
[1:24:54] we're gonna close soon
[1:24:57] you see the sun
[1:24:59] seem in the way of the revelation that
[1:25:00] god has revealing to you the only way
[1:25:02] you will ever know the sun
[1:25:04] is that god has revealed them to you
[1:25:06] do you not see the message after message
[1:25:08] there's an emphasis you can only know
[1:25:11] god by revelation
[1:25:14] but i'm saying many times misunderstood
[1:25:15] and i've tried my best to explain it to
[1:25:17] the people see the reason is i can't do
[1:25:19] it it has to be revelation
[1:25:21] do not take revelation out of the word
[1:25:25] it is the most essential ingredient of
[1:25:27] the word
[1:25:29] it's not about proving it with quotes
[1:25:31] and scriptures and scriptures and i
[1:25:32] believe you ought to know the scriptures
[1:25:34] i'm not saying we don't have to what i'm
[1:25:36] saying is that what matters the most is
[1:25:38] that god has deposited something in your
[1:25:41] soul that nobody can ever take away from
[1:25:44] you
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:46] that is why when we come to the service
[1:25:48] we're preaching all in what god has
[1:25:49] revealed to us
[1:25:51] we are preaching what god makes real to
[1:25:53] us but the same way we come prayerfully
[1:25:56] you ought to come to church prayerfully
[1:25:58] and say lord the word is gonna be
[1:26:00] preached don't let it stop into my mind
[1:26:03] what is just intellectual understanding
[1:26:05] but let the word of god come down in my
[1:26:07] soul and be transformed into a divine
[1:26:10] revelation
[1:26:11] because if you don't do that you're in
[1:26:13] danger of staying in church for years
[1:26:16] with a mental understanding of the
[1:26:18] message
[1:26:22] but the first thing is the seal of
[1:26:24] christ it has to be a spiritual
[1:26:27] revelation that god has given to the
[1:26:29] individual that jesus christ is a son of
[1:26:32] god calling that's right without that
[1:26:34] brother you are only impersonating
[1:26:37] is you are only pretending
[1:26:41] if the message and the word of the hour
[1:26:43] has not become a divine personal
[1:26:46] revelation you are pretending
[1:26:49] the reason why they live is because they
[1:26:51] played church for years they pretended
[1:26:55] to be believers but in their soul there
[1:26:58] was never a revelation
[1:27:01] oh my i just want to drive down home
[1:27:03] tonight revelation alone
[1:27:13] in conclusion
[1:27:16] who was back there to tell him a better
[1:27:18] way to make the world
[1:27:20] who would dare to tell him how to run
[1:27:22] his business
[1:27:23] every word of god itself is sovereign
[1:27:26] even
[1:27:27] the revelation
[1:27:29] is sovereign and this is what i wanted
[1:27:30] to get to he reveals to whom he will
[1:27:34] reveal it
[1:27:36] the
[1:27:37] very revelation itself is sovereign in
[1:27:44] god luke chapter 10 verse 21 and 22.
[1:27:50] in that hour
[1:27:51] jesus rejoice in spirit
[1:27:54] and say i thank thee o father lord of
[1:27:57] heaven
[1:27:58] and of earth that thou see these things
[1:28:00] from the wise and prudent and has
[1:28:02] revealed them
[1:28:05] that jesus websites he's rejoicing in
[1:28:07] spirit
[1:28:08] it's not just uh oh that's good
[1:28:11] there's a groaning in the spirit realm
[1:28:14] and i like to think this is just me i
[1:28:15] like to think that jesus was walking and
[1:28:18] then something struck him
[1:28:20] like just god the father just dropped
[1:28:22] this revelation in his heart just
[1:28:23] dropped it right there and in that hour
[1:28:26] he rejoiced when he got it and i said oh
[1:28:28] father i thank you
[1:28:30] i just received a revelation that you
[1:28:32] have you've hidden these things from the
[1:28:34] west and the prudent but you only reveal
[1:28:37] it to bits oh my
[1:28:40] so revelation is sovereign
[1:28:42] god chooses to whom he's gonna make
[1:28:44] himself known to
[1:28:49] for
[1:28:51] for it seemed good in thy sight
[1:28:54] all things are delivered to me of my
[1:28:56] father and no man know what the son
[1:28:58] by the father and who the father is but
[1:29:00] the son and he to whom the son will
[1:29:03] reveal him
[1:29:04] so now look at this
[1:29:06] those two whom things are hidden
[1:29:08] it's not because they did anything wrong
[1:29:11] those two whom things are revealed it's
[1:29:13] not because they did anything right
[1:29:16] it's god
[1:29:17] exercising his sovereignty
[1:29:20] that god is free to choose who he wants
[1:29:23] to make himself known to
[1:29:25] many of you are friends of mine that i
[1:29:27] love but there are certain things that
[1:29:28] are only open not to certain people it
[1:29:30] is my choice nothing against you it's
[1:29:33] not that i hate you it's not like you
[1:29:35] did something wrong to me he said i am a
[1:29:36] sovereign person i can choose to whom
[1:29:39] i'm going to make myself known to
[1:29:41] that is god's prerogative to choose to
[1:29:44] whom he's going to reveal himself
[1:29:50] luke 8
[1:29:51] verse 9 and 10 verse 10
[1:29:53] and he said
[1:29:54] unto you it is given to the mysteries of
[1:29:57] the kingdom of god
[1:30:00] unto you
[1:30:01] it is given
[1:30:03] not to everyone not to all the jews just
[1:30:06] to the disciples not to all the churches
[1:30:08] just to his bread it is given to know
[1:30:11] the mysteries of god
[1:30:13] is it fair yes it is fair
[1:30:16] first corinthians two verse seven and
[1:30:18] eight
[1:30:19] we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery
[1:30:22] even the hidden wisdom which god
[1:30:23] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:30:25] world for our glory
[1:30:27] which none of the princes of this world
[1:30:29] knew for had they known it
[1:30:32] they would not have crucified the lord
[1:30:34] god
[1:30:35] now my this is a dangerous situation
[1:30:38] here because if god had revealed who
[1:30:41] christ was to everyone there'll be no
[1:30:43] crucifixion
[1:30:46] so if revelation was given to everyone
[1:30:49] christ will not be crucified
[1:30:51] so it is then necessary that some
[1:30:53] people's eyes remain closed
[1:30:56] for the purpose of god to be fulfilled
[1:30:58] in us
[1:30:59] because if revelation was given to
[1:31:00] everyone cain would not have killed abel
[1:31:04] seth will not be a type of the
[1:31:05] resurrection jesus would not have died
[1:31:08] the blood would not have been shed
[1:31:09] humanity will be stuck in the limbo the
[1:31:12] bridge between man and god will still
[1:31:14] remain close
[1:31:15] the book will forever remain in the
[1:31:16] hands of god the love will not be able
[1:31:18] to claim the book and lose the seals the
[1:31:21] ramifications of giving up revelation to
[1:31:24] everybody is serious
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:26] that is why god chooses to whom he's
[1:31:29] gonna make himself known to that is why
[1:31:32] you and i we are to rejoice that we of
[1:31:35] that group of people that he selected to
[1:31:38] make himself known to
[1:31:43] [Music]
[1:31:46] then i mentioned that it takes the holy
[1:31:48] spirit to give us revelation and we fail
[1:31:49] to get it
[1:31:50] bringing these two thoughts together you
[1:31:52] will see that it won't take just an
[1:31:54] ordinary study
[1:31:56] it it's not about thinking to make this
[1:31:59] book real it's going to take the
[1:32:00] operation of the holy ghost
[1:32:03] listen
[1:32:04] that means this book
[1:32:07] can't be revealed to anyone
[1:32:10] but
[1:32:11] a special class of people
[1:32:14] and it will take one with prophetic
[1:32:16] insight it will require one with the
[1:32:18] ability to hear from god
[1:32:21] you have the ability to hear from god my
[1:32:25] sheep know my verse but what i'm saying
[1:32:27] is the revelation of the word that is
[1:32:30] what you and i have the ability to hear
[1:32:33] this revelation cannot be meant not to
[1:32:36] everyone but a special class
[1:32:39] and i'm here to tell you you are a
[1:32:41] special class
[1:32:42] don't look at your failures don't look
[1:32:44] at your flesh if this message has been
[1:32:47] revealed to you
[1:32:48] come true self-privileged
[1:32:51] [Applause]
[1:32:55] if the light of god the holy spirit ever
[1:32:57] strikes a predestinated seed whose name
[1:33:00] was put on the lamb's book of life
[1:33:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:33:04] the bible says that's right the light
[1:33:06] will shine now listen
[1:33:09] you can preach to some
[1:33:11] and it seems like it's just water on a
[1:33:14] dark's back
[1:33:15] falls off
[1:33:16] but let it once
[1:33:18] shrek that predestinated seed and watch
[1:33:21] what happens
[1:33:23] something is in there right now why it's
[1:33:26] a predestinated seed coming forth it's
[1:33:29] got to come and when that light the
[1:33:31] gospel strikes it they get it
[1:33:35] it was a predestinated seat in you when
[1:33:38] somebody handed you a book of serpentine
[1:33:41] that life strike and you got it
[1:33:44] because it was a predestinated seat in
[1:33:45] you my brother while you were walking
[1:33:47] you said god why didn't you sign a
[1:33:49] prophet and when you heard about this
[1:33:50] prophet that light strike that
[1:33:52] projectionated scene and you said i get
[1:33:55] it
[1:33:56] [Applause]
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:59] when that light strike little rebecca
[1:34:01] she knew something within her all had to
[1:34:04] bring her back to isaac
[1:34:06] the message of eloheeser struck rebecca
[1:34:09] beyond the physical senses beyond the
[1:34:11] senses in the spirit realm something
[1:34:13] began to roll down from eternity into
[1:34:16] her soul and brought her to isaac
[1:34:20] i was thinking this
[1:34:21] brother dan we worked on the message lab
[1:34:24] if you type a search term
[1:34:27] and if what you're searching is included
[1:34:29] in the database you get a result back
[1:34:32] correct
[1:34:33] if you put in a search term that is not
[1:34:35] in there it says no match found
[1:34:38] so for a search to be successful
[1:34:42] the search term that you're looking for
[1:34:44] must already be contained in that
[1:34:46] database so when the word is being
[1:34:48] preached it's a search going out
[1:34:51] if in you in your soul there isn't
[1:34:54] already what i'm searching for there's
[1:34:56] zero match but if there is a match it
[1:34:59] says one match found
[1:35:01] when that world came to this day god was
[1:35:04] searching when it struck your brother
[1:35:06] george it said one much fun
[1:35:08] what is structure he began there was a
[1:35:10] mass that was found
[1:35:12] for certain people there is no match
[1:35:15] because in them there is nothing
[1:35:19] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i
[1:35:22] thank you father that you mean there was
[1:35:25] something that the world doesn't find
[1:35:28] hallelujah not because you did it not
[1:35:31] because you are good but because there's
[1:35:33] a sin of god he knew and god was
[1:35:36] sovereign enough to come to you
[1:35:39] and make himself known to you
[1:35:43] you've got what it takes to go beyond
[1:35:45] your face
[1:35:46] you are built to look beyond your face
[1:35:49] stumbling blocks are not for you
[1:35:52] therefore the ones that are going to
[1:35:53] fall away
[1:35:54] but for you there's a seat inside of you
[1:35:56] that contains a germ of life that can be
[1:35:59] quickened through the revelation of this
[1:36:01] hour
[1:36:02] and that's a house built on the rock you
[1:36:05] don't need intellect
[1:36:06] you don't need signs and miracles and
[1:36:08] wonders all those things are good but to
[1:36:10] withstand the assault of the enemy
[1:36:12] against this truth
[1:36:13] all you need is what you already got
[1:36:15] revelation
[1:36:17] let's stand
[1:36:18] [Applause]
[1:36:28] we ought to pray for revelation
[1:36:31] pray every day
[1:36:32] lord reveal yourself to me
[1:36:35] reveal yourself to me and god wants to
[1:36:38] impart his life to you oh man there's a
[1:36:41] quote that was shared with me recently
[1:36:42] that just frightened my mind a brother
[1:36:43] who talks about the joy that god has in
[1:36:46] importing his life to you oh my
[1:36:50] he he compares it to a man and a woman a
[1:36:53] man giving seed to a woman he says that
[1:36:54] is how god wants to impart his life to
[1:36:57] you
[1:37:00] more than anything he wants to be
[1:37:02] worshipped absolutely but what he
[1:37:04] desires the most is to make himself
[1:37:07] personal to you
[1:37:09] he desired it that's what brother said
[1:37:11] why do you hunger why do you thirst is
[1:37:13] your father desiring to make himself
[1:37:16] known to you to reveal himself to you
[1:37:19] god wants to give you revelation
[1:37:22] and if you don't have it pray for it
[1:37:25] unless the message of the hour and the
[1:37:27] word of god has become a personal
[1:37:29] revelation to you we have zero
[1:37:31] foundation
[1:37:33] and i'm saddened to say that you've been
[1:37:34] in a message for five five years 10 15
[1:37:37] 40 years one day
[1:37:39] after all the wins
[1:37:41] and after all the falling away and after
[1:37:43] all the events and after all the
[1:37:44] offenses you'll be tired and you go back
[1:37:48] but if it's been revealed to you
[1:37:51] even if you tried
[1:37:52] you won't be able to leave it because
[1:37:55] you're hooked by it you are addicted to
[1:37:58] the life of god how can you live it when
[1:38:02] it's a part of god himself in you
[1:38:06] i want to take this opportunity to
[1:38:07] publicly declare i stand firm on this
[1:38:11] message
[1:38:12] being god's true for this day
[1:38:15] quote me
[1:38:16] if i leave it in 10 years play this
[1:38:18] service back because i'm not going to
[1:38:20] recant what i said tonight this has been
[1:38:23] personally revealed to me as being the
[1:38:27] truth of god for this day that's my
[1:38:30] revelation get your own revelation
[1:38:35] and i just want to thank you lord for
[1:38:38] letting me hear your word
[1:38:39] what have i done to deserve nothing such
[1:38:42] glory revealed in me thanks for that
[1:38:44] special night when i saw this glorious
[1:38:47] life i came face to face with eternal
[1:38:50] life lord i thank you
[1:38:53] you didn't have to open my eyes you
[1:38:55] could have easily been passed me by
[1:38:57] oh my
[1:38:59] hallelujah
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:03] heavenly father
[1:39:05] thank you for your word
[1:39:06] thank you for revelation lord we thank
[1:39:09] you for it lord oh god i pray that if
[1:39:11] there's somebody here who will still
[1:39:13] rely on a mental conception of the word
[1:39:16] who perhaps is still following after
[1:39:17] signs and wonders and after some form of
[1:39:19] simulation i pray that tonight will be
[1:39:22] the night where something solid
[1:39:24] something everlasting something real
[1:39:27] will come down into their soul god and i
[1:39:30] pray this is anybody among us who's had
[1:39:32] this revelation but who's been bombarded
[1:39:34] in their mind let them know where to
[1:39:36] stand on he said what you've already
[1:39:38] given them is more than enough
[1:39:40] and if you could give us anything more
[1:39:42] than revelation you would but you've
[1:39:43] given us revelation because the guests
[1:39:45] of hell can never prevail
[1:39:48] against revelation
[1:39:50] i commit the people into your hands lord
[1:39:52] forgive me father perhaps for not being
[1:39:54] as adequate as i wanted to be but take
[1:39:56] your word oh god make it real not a
[1:39:59] knowledge of revelations brother by
[1:40:00] themselves but let it be a revelation
[1:40:02] itself
[1:40:04] granted lord in the name of jesus christ
[1:40:06] amen for the thing
[1:40:09] [Music]

[1:43:43] as our brother said and i underlined it
[1:43:46] revelation cannot be over emphasized
[1:43:50] [Music]
[1:43:52] and brother john covered it so well but
[1:43:55] i'll say didn't cover half of it
[1:43:57] that's how great revelation is and even
[1:44:00] just the subject of revelation it goes
[1:44:03] beyond what any preacher can preach but
[1:44:06] it was some pretty good preaching
[1:44:07] tonight
[1:44:09] on the subject of revelation

[1:44:33] but
[1:44:34] i want to take you back to the pastor's
[1:44:37] own testimony
[1:44:39] sitting on a log
[1:44:41] with a prophet
[1:44:43] talking about serpency which he didn't
[1:44:46] see
[1:44:48] and you know you might have somebody
[1:44:51] that you know that doesn't see it yet
[1:44:55] but a prophet of god was saying to our
[1:44:58] pastor
[1:45:00] as brother biscuit said but eve said
[1:45:03] i've gotten a man from the lord and the
[1:45:05] prophet said
[1:45:07] and then what did she say in the next
[1:45:08] verse or what was the next verse
[1:45:11] and and brother biscuit says well i
[1:45:13] couldn't even remember the next verse
[1:45:14] and he says eve begot abel and or begot
[1:45:18] canaan also beget abel and he said they
[1:45:21] were twins and and explained him very
[1:45:23] briefly serpent seed he didn't go in to
[1:45:26] make it easy for him
[1:45:28] but he just laid it out for him and then
[1:45:30] he said this he says
[1:45:32] you pray about it and i'll pray for you
[1:45:35] and god will reveal it to you
[1:45:39] first time i heard that
[1:45:42] that smote my heart he didn't he wasn't
[1:45:44] trying to convince him
[1:45:47] [Music]
[1:45:48] he wasn't trying to to show him all the
[1:45:50] different scriptures as we might when we
[1:45:52] share serpent seed with somebody he just
[1:45:55] shared one scripture he says now you
[1:45:57] pray i'll pray for you and the lord will
[1:46:00] reveal it to you
[1:46:02] hallelujah
[1:46:03] revelation is sovereign of god
[1:46:07] you know somebody you want to have
[1:46:08] revelation pray for them
[1:46:11] you share the word you might say
[1:46:12] something to them you might even be here

[1:46:16] all uh but i was rejoicing
[1:46:19] in the testimony of sister zoe it's
[1:46:22] sister zoe wasn't it on sunday

[1:46:26] word

[1:46:32] uh

[1:46:36] sharing some things and she was just
[1:46:37] seeing it and then brother murphy was
[1:46:39] talking to her and she was just seeing
[1:46:41] it and she was just seeing it and then
[1:46:43] all she said was what's next
[1:46:46] what's next repent and be baptized in
[1:46:48] the name of jesus christ

[1:48:53] you want
[1:48:54] that's a type of vessel that'll just
[1:48:56] surrender themselves
[1:48:58] and die to themselves lord because they
[1:49:00] have no ability of their own to preach
[1:49:03] this word and we heard about tonight
[1:49:04] father it's not intellect but it's a
[1:49:06] revelation that we have need of but we
[1:49:09] don't have to explain this message to
[1:49:10] anybody you didn't lord
[1:49:13] in fact you offended many people but you
[1:49:15] knew who you were your own lord and you
