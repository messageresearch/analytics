[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] I this lady I gave her a handkerchief
[0:03] she wanted me to she said bless the
[0:05] handkerchief now a lot of people anoint
[0:07] them that's all right anything that God
[0:09] blesses I'm for it but if you watch the
[0:11] scripture Paul didn't anoint them he
[0:13] take them off of his body see just off
[0:15] of his body I believe that's right isn't
[0:17] it and Paul knew that you know where I
[0:20] think he got that brethen I think when
[0:22] Elijah taken the to said take my staff
[0:24] and go lay it on the child you see
[0:26] Elijah knew that everything that he
[0:28] touched was blessed but whether the
[0:29] woman would believe it or not and Paul
[0:31] taken from his body anguishes and aprons
[0:34] and laid on the sck unclean spirits went
[0:36] out of them and the diseases were healed
[0:38] now it wasn't Paul it was God it was God
[0:42] and honoring the people's faith in his
[0:44] servant well not the same God was there
[0:47] I'm not the St Paul none of us are but
[0:49] he's still the same Jesus you see it
[0:51] wasn't it wasn't the St Paul anyhow but
[0:55] it was Jesus now this woman taking it
[0:58] and put it in her Bible and a few weeks
[1:00] after that she was cleaning a lamp
[1:03] chimney way back there in a cotton
[1:05] country of Arkansas and the old L
[1:07] chimney broken and cut the archery in
[1:09] her arm now this is her story she got a
[1:12] pillow slipped and put over it just got
[1:15] wet with blood she got a sheep poest
[1:17] neighbor was two miles her husband was
[1:19] in the city and she was bleeding getting
[1:21] weaker she knew she was going to die
[1:22] shortly if something didn't happen and
[1:25] she thought of the Handi she went got
[1:27] the hand Chief and laid it on there now
[1:29] here's her t morning when her husband
[1:31] came in that evening she waited about
[1:34] two mes at her through the mud with her
[1:36] boots on hung a lantern in the tree
[1:39] caught the Greyhound bus and come to a
[1:41] little rock where it's holding the
[1:42] meeting and walked in with these boots
[1:44] on holding this H ship praising God the
[1:47] H wasn't even stained just a miracle
[1:49] just stopped it right like that the
[1:51] woman was dying that's the only thing
[1:53] that she could get to like that and she
[1:54] knew him and God honored her faith in
[1:57] doing so now we all us believe that well
[2:01] I sent a little thing with it it tells
[2:03] you how you get to your pastor and get
[2:04] him to come and and confess your faults
[2:07] and get rid of everything and then lay
[2:09] it on there there's nothing in the way
[2:10] God will do it don't you believe that
[2:13] and now God be with you th son of man
[2:16] the children of thy people still are
[2:18] talking against thee by the walls and in
[2:20] the doors of the houses and speak one to
[2:22] another everyone to his brother saying
[2:26] come I pray you and hear what is the
[2:28] word that cometh forth from the Lord and
[2:31] they come unto thee as the people cometh
[2:33] and they sit before thee as my people
[2:35] and they hear thy words but they will
[2:37] not do them for with their mouth they
[2:39] show much love but their heart goeth
[2:42] after their covetousness and lo Thou Art
[2:45] unto them as a very lovely song of one
[2:47] that hath a pleasant voice and can play
[2:49] well on an instrument for they hear thy
[2:52] words but they do them not and when this
[2:55] cometh to pass Lo it will come then
[2:58] shall they know that a prophet hath been
[3:00] among them
