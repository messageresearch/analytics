Roy, our precious loving heavenly father, already we have felt your presence in this sanctuary, oh God. And Lord, we just want to bow our hearts and our faces down to the ground from whence we came. &gt;&gt; And honor you, the King of glory this morning, Father. Every song that's been sung in the sanctuary this morning, Father, has spoken about and and dedicate and declare your love and grace and mercy and guidance. &gt;&gt; How you left, oh God, your the ramplets of glory, your your majesty, and you came in as a humble servant. You just didn't come into a darkened world, but in the hearts of souls that were first born in your presence, oh God, to redeem us back to yourself. What an honor, Father. What a privilege that we have this morning to open our mouths and our hearts and worship the King of glory this morning. Men and women who've fallen from grace are now back into the oneness of God. Oh God, what a wonderful opportunity that we have this morning to call upon the King of glory this morning, Father, to honor you amongst us this morning, Father. It is indeed a privilege that we are we are lost of words, oh Father, to be able to tell you how wonderful we feel to be in your presence this morning. Father, we thank you, oh God, for the testimony of our brother. How you've come and destroy that enemy, oh God, who tried to take his life and hinder him from coming into the fullness of his relationship with you. But we thank you, oh God, that you've already delivered him, oh Father. And those, oh God, who are bound by this demon of cigarettes, we pray that, oh God, you will continue to move upon their lives and deliver them, oh God. We pray this morning. Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, we lay our hands on this request that was written by our sister, Father, for those who are in need this morning. Lord, we pray that, oh God, because they've been pinned down by faith, that you will honor the faith of our sister this morning and heal that one who is in need this morning. We pray, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, there are those who are needy amongst us this morning. Lord, today we think of all the families that will be gathered together, oh God, and who will be celebrating this time of Christmas.

Oh, cuz I just want to leave the be his will in every way. to be lost in his presence. Found in his likeness here say well someday [Music] to what a tiny simple st allbe and one hardly a place for a king to be born. He didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty. So I know if I'll give him control, he'll be born in me. Let your word be born in a manger of my heart. Let it in me. Where are live inside this house of clay and mold it every day. Let your word be born in a manger of my heart. Outwardly I'm nothing, not much to behold unlikely a place for his word to unfold.

For his word to be born in our hearts. Amen. Believe it. That work's already happened. I was born to be a dwelling place, a home for the presence of the Lord. Let's sing it together and then maybe the visible sisters have a song for us this morning. For I was born to be a Heat. Heat. Heat.

We want to greet all of our internet family, all those who are worshiping with us just now, not in the visible congregation, but we just greet them each one in the name of Jesus Christ.

And for us that are here, I pray that your day today will be a very, very precious time in God's presence. We want his presence. &gt;&gt; We want him to be pleased, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh maybe I'll just have you have your seats for a moment. We'll be turning to the word in just a moment, but I I don't want to keep you standing too long. This is a special Sunday. uh not merely because it's December the 25th. That's not really what is so special to me. What is really special to me is that this is 40 years as of last night that God called Brother Brandham off the scene. 40 years, one generation. and I and my wife were sitting in our in our den room in Toronto. Uh and uh our children were were just been put to bed. So it was evening and I was pondering. I knew that brother Brandham was laying in a coma in the hospital in Amarillo, Texas. And uh I had uh Sister Tammy Laroo's father. He he and I had been in touch with each other. And brother Tom Brown uh said he would call me just soon as he heard anything. And while I was sitting there, I was just, you know, I was pondering the Christmas season. It was very Christmas, of course, out there. you know, they have snow on the ground and and uh it was like it was like just something just overwhelmed me and come over me and my wife was sitting nearby and I said, "Just think, dear. You know, this is Christmas Eve." And uh yeah, the the store windows are full of manger scenes and the church bells are ringing and the churches are having Christmas service, Christmas Eve services and candlelight services and and the radio waves around the earth. Uh the radios are playing out all kinds of Christmas carols and joy to the world. the Lord has come and all of these things. I said, "If if Brother Brandham with the phenomenal life that he had and the birth and the light and all the phenomena that followed his life, I said, "If he lives beyond this season and just dies," I said, "I won't understand that." But I think just imagine just think what if God took him right at this time when the whole world is declaring the whole Christian world is declaring we believe he came the first time and we believe in John the Baptist we believe that he sent a forerunner the first time and announced his coming and uh we believe all these things what would happen I said what what what would happen I was trying to in asking her I was trying to assimilate the depth of the meaning myself if right at this time while the world's declaring that we believe he came the first time the messenger of his second coming is taken off the scene and about two hours from then the phone rang and said he's gone well I was like you probably feel just now I was I was smitten I thought what should I be doing what should I do I thought probably I I I need to just run across this whole nation just tell him it's over. It's over. And I just didn't know what what God was going to do from then because as far as I was concerned, it was impossible. We had to go to more meetings. We had to hear more services. There was more things to happen. You know, it never occurred to us that we got to preach this message. We're just listening to it. We're just enjoying it. We're just waiting for the next series of meetings. We're waiting to see what, you know, God's messenger is going to bring next. That's that's what on our minds. When's the next set of meetings? And here it was all still and gone. Well, I can tell you there were some deep thoughts that went through our minds. And I was thinking of uh you know, the Joshua Commission. Brother Bram talked about his Joshua commission. And the angel of the Lord said, "As Moses was given two signs, you'll be given two signs. If they don't believe the first sign, I'll they will believe the next sign. I'll because the next sign will have a voice. There'll be a voice behind the sign. And if they don't believe the first sign, I'll cause them to believe the second. For I'll make you to know the very secrets of their hearts." And that's what happened. And they had to believe it right to the very end. Right at the very end. I mean they had to they had to believe that it was God even though they didn't believe the message part of it. And then I got thinking of the you know brother Brandham talks about said Joshua means Jehovah savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church and even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed with the true Joshua with Joshua. They stayed true with Joshua. Joshua was a God-scent prophet and he knew the promises of God and he waited for them. He waited for a clear-cut decision from God. And when the time came to move, God placed the full leadership in Joshua's hands because he had stayed with the word and God could trust Joshua but not the others. So it will repeat in this end day the same problem and the same pressures. And in the court trial message in Birmingham, Alabama, he said, "Now Joshua said, I still the people." Is Joshua speaking? I still the people by telling them keep quiet. God said so. God said it. And that's true. But you know there they were only two days from there. That's Kadesh Barnea. They were only two days from Kadesh Barnea. They were only two days. They would have been in the promised land, but Joshua said it was 40 years before we took the land. And that's what Joshua said in in his book in Joshua's the 14 chapter 14 said 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kades Barnea to as spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart. Now he's referring back to Kadesh Barnea two verses down. This is verse for verse 10 chapter 14. And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said, these 40 and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, and now lo, I am this day four score and five years. There were an extra 40 years. But God took another generation into the land. And you know, there was a I I would like you people that are here and all who are listening today, we need to be able to appreciate fully what God has allowed and permitted us to have what others weren't permitted to have. We don't know why, but there was a whole generation of people saw the signs, had the hearts revealed, were in that remarkable atmosphere, but aren't here today, aren't following it today. And here you are. Most of you have never seen it, &gt;&gt; heard a tape, read a book, whatever more. But God, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, God in his uh abundant mercy &gt;&gt; and in his predestinated plan, open your eyes and your understanding and said, "I'll take them in. &gt;&gt; I'll take them in because they will believe it. They do believe it." Hallelujah. Oh, and I'm thankful to be identified &gt;&gt; with a group of people today that believe it &gt;&gt; with all their heart. &gt;&gt; I thank you for your love and your prayers. I thank you for the cards and things and uh words of encouragement that you've given. I I know you wouldn't be here if there just wasn't something in your heart. And I thank you for it. I really do. And I trust that we can we can never be worthy of it, but we will try to be of service to you as long as God gives us strength and allows us to be that. Amen. I would like to speak today and we don't have any service this evening. That's fine. I'm not going to speak till this evening, but I would like to speak on this subject. Deity united with humanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now you can stand once again. Thank you. Sure enjoyed that song. Even if they were my daughters, I tell you what, I it's not not that part of it. It's just hearing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some worship to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everyone feeling good? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham asked that often. You feeling good? That's that's important. I want you to be feeling good. Hallelujah. We're coming up now. Next next uh Saturday evening is a watch night service. And uh you know, I thought I I just talked to all you see you young men and you young ladies that are here and those you that God has done something very very special for you. You probably didn't catch it, but I think it's remarkable that God did this just coming up to this 40-year anniversary. a whole new generation. &gt;&gt; If I were you, I would this morning as of this moment, I'd say, "Brother Brandon, Brother Biscll's trying to tell us something." And probably if you' talked to the young people and the young young ones that were going into the promised land said, "Do you feel any different?" They probably say, "Well, no, I really don't." But they were different in that God was doing something different in their season. &gt;&gt; And there is something very different that is happening. And I want you to really really have a uh not merely an appreciation but that you will have an openness towards God and say, "God, you didn't call me for nothing. You called me for something. You called me and you have a purpose. &gt;&gt; You have a purpose. Whatever it is, man or woman, we have a we have a purpose. God has a purpose for our lives. Let's just pray before we read. Dear Father, how I thank you this morning that we have life and breath within our body and we are able to come and express what we would like to express to you. Perhaps not fully, but we we know that you look on the heart. You don't look on the outward, Lord, but you look upon the heart. And the as we look upon one another as brothers and sisters here within the congregation, we do not really see what's in the heart, but you see what's in the heart. And we're so thankful this morning that you you look upon us, oh God, and you see our desires, the desires that you've placed there in our desires to serve you, desires to love you and to be true to you. And Lord, I pray that you'll help us. Help us in our frailty. Help us in our weaknesses. Oh God, help us although we have failed you. We ask you to forgive us. And we pray, dear Lord, that you'll take us and strengthen us. That we might serve you with more courage. We might be fervent, oh God, that we truly may have the spirit that was upon Joshua. Oh, to be courageous, you said to him, and heed the word and do it. And we pray, oh God, you'll help us. We ask this morning you'll give uh cause me to be fluent with the word Lord and with clarity of thought. May it be the very thought and mind of God made known to the people. Bless this people I pray. Bless us together. Anoint us each one as we stand at our post of duty in Jesus Christ's name and for his glory alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Happy to have our brother and sister Andy's here with us. And I'm sure it was nice for them to see their grandchildren singing. I see brother Kim Dingwall here. God bless you, brother Kim. Nice to see you and brother Ben. Shook hands with him as well and many others that are perhaps visiting and we're happy that you're here because a lot of our people are away. But uh but we're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read out of Genesis the 3 chapter uh a few verses there. Genesis 3 and we're going to read verses 23 uh 22 23 and 24. And the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become as one of us to know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever." Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubams and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life. Amen. You may be seated. Strange scripture for perhaps a a Christmas day service. But every day, you know, we although this day is uh is perhaps special, but I think every day needs to be special to us as far as as far as the you know the working of God is concerned and and our relationship with the Lord. But these verses which we have read just now they are the the real meaning of Christmas is perhaps disguised but I don't think it's disguised in these verses. The real meaning of Christmas which is God bringing Jesus Christ his son into the world as a remedy for sin. Christmas is because of what happened right here in these verses. And that is that God had to drive Adam and Eve out from the place that they had been intended to be. And that union that was between God and man now turned into a separation. That separation had to be had to come back into a complete union again. And that's why I titled the service today deity united with humanity because that's what Christmas is. deity united with humanity. And there were times I'd like to just give a a a brief overview first. There were times when you can see through the scripture where God would draw near to the people. And that is why even we say prophet and they're prophets of the Old Testament. But the reason why God even established a prophet, the office of a prophet was so that he could draw near to the people because he had to have a vessel. And I can say that having not having not experienced, you know, what a prophet's office is except to have been near the prophet of this generation. But when you read those of the Old Testament, they were so misunderstood. They were considered as mad men. They were considered uh out of their mind and consequently they paid for it with their lives. Jesus said of the scribes and the Pharisees, you've slain every one of them. But why were they slain? Was because they were they were men that were unearly to the population. Read Ezekiel. You can't understand Ezekiel for the life of you. &gt;&gt; You can't understand many of the things that the prophet spoke. We get glimpses of pieces here and there and so on. But what was the prophet established for? God established that office so he could draw near to the people. But it was a treacherous place for a man to be. &gt;&gt; You want to believe that? It was a treacherous place for a man to be. Brother Bram told me that where he went in inspiration was just a razor's edge from insanity where you go up into that kind of inspiration and then come and then have to come back down into this here, &gt;&gt; you know, because that inspiration just lifts a person up. And that's why people today, even in the drug world, they want to get something. They want to get something that lifts them out of reality. So it's the world's not real and and then they want to stay on it. It's not just that they gets addicted, but they want to stay there because they don't like the real world. They don't like the problems. They don't like the decisions. They don't want to face life the way that it is. So they stay in some other realm as long as it is possible and then of course become addicted to it. But you know that's just a devil's substitute. &gt;&gt; That's all it is. It's a devil's and it's a poor substitute. It destroys the body and destroys the mind and people live in some other world. All right, but nevertheless, it's not God's way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the prophets, they were one of the uh tools or instruments that God used to draw near to the people. And that is why the first prophet Moses when he came on the scene and God established him, the people said, "You speak to us. We we don't want God to speak. It was too fearful. It was too It was just too fearful for them and they were gripped with fear. So they would sooner have a vessel stand between them and God. You hear him and then you come back and tell us. So God had these times when he drew near and he instructed Moses, you made a tabernacle and you constructed a certain way and you do all of these things precisely because I want to dwell with the people. I want to be near them and I want to be where they can, you know, but God has always been veiled. He had to always veil himself. Brother Brandham said Job, he wanted he wanted a God with skin on. He wanted to go up to his door and knock on his door and talk to him because man has always desired that. But because of this separation in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. &gt;&gt; You shall surely be separated. This oneness, this closeness, uh this unity between God and man would be separated. And the whole story of the book from Genesis to Revelation is for that union to come back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when Jesus was born and then I'm I'm just giving you this quick overview. When Jesus was born, deity was united with humanity completely. He was a God man. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. But was this only for him? I say no, it wasn't. Had it been for him only. And if that had been if that had sufficed the heart of God, then God wouldn't have wanted anything further. But that was not sufficient &gt;&gt; because Jesus said it's expedient for you that I go. If I don't go, he won't come. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. &gt;&gt; He says one place the father will send the holy spirit. next place he says, "I'll send him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One God. &gt;&gt; And so we're believing in that's what deity is. Deity is the belief in one God. &gt;&gt; We believe in one God. &gt;&gt; And this God wanted to be united in a fusion with humanity that is beyond our understanding. But it was essential because this this body this man is doomed to die &gt;&gt; or be changed one or the other. But by the sin of our our four parents, Adam and Eve, we have been born in sin. And so we have that and we pack it. We pack this weak body with us. The flesh is weak. But I want to I want to major on this dual aspect of deity and humanity. We are humans and uh as far as the church world is concerned, most don't want to approach the subject of deity because then that they think that that gets off into cultism. But I'll tell you something. If we haven't got deity in us, then Jesus did not speak the truth. He said, "I will be in you." &gt;&gt; And if he was not deity, then we don't have salvation. If he was not deity, then there was no point in the crucifixion. If he was not deity, even the resurrection, what does that mean? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was deity fused together with humanity because it had to be that way. And then was it only for Jesus? No, it wasn't only for Jesus because then on the day of Pentecost, he said now, now he will be in you when he, the spirit of truth has come, he will be in you. He will dwell in you. This is going to be something different. This is at another level. But then all through the church ages, all through the church ages, then at the end, now it's not because we want to make brother Brandham something, but you cannot find I I I defy anybody to find a history book, any book of religion, any leader of the past that had the kind of of ministry. I'm talking about the whole scope of it. I'm not talking about healing. And I'm not talking just about the revealing of the heart. I'm talking about the healing, the supernatural, the phenomena, and the angel of the Lord, the pillar of fire in attendance all the time. &gt;&gt; And then the supernatural with the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, the oneness of the Godhead, there's been people that have believed that, but haven't tied it together with the baptism. There's been people that have put it together with the baptism. But then the serpent seed, you cannot deny the serpent seed. is from Genesis straight through to Revelation. Absolutely. And if you put all of these together and the opening of the seals and the opening of the word, you put all of those together, the MelzDC ministry, put all of that together, I tell you what, and you cannot find a ministry that is so knitted and stitched together in oneness with the scriptures from Genesis through to Revelation. That kind of a ministry came at the end time because there had to be a fusion of deity with humanity at another level. And that level happens to be husband and wife. &gt;&gt; And that's the only time the scripture refers to when it says to husband and wife, they too shall be one flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that has direct reference to the bride of Jesus Christ and the bridegroom which is which is our Lord Jesus Christ. It is deity. And thus they had to have this kind of a ministry at this end time so he could speak of the mighty God unveiled because God was deity was behind that skin &gt;&gt; making himself known to his people because that was not for him alone. It was for you &gt;&gt; as Jesus the deity God in God in Jehovah in an infant &gt;&gt; Jehovah in Christ Jesus. But it was not for him alone. It was for you. And that's why I said, "I'll be in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good that I'm with you, but it's more important that I will be in you. &gt;&gt; And as long as he was in that temple, I can't be in you. It's important that I go so the Holy Spirit will come and he'll be in you. &gt;&gt; And then we've gone all through the church ages. And at the end of the church age, here comes a a I'll say a God man, &gt;&gt; a man with God in him. &gt;&gt; Well, you could say lots of people have had God true, but not at this level, &gt;&gt; not at this capacity, not at this intensity, not with this kind of vindication, &gt;&gt; not with this perfection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And because God did that, he was indicating. He was saying it's not just for me, it's for you. &gt;&gt; He was saying the wick of the messengers. The w the messengers have their wick dipped in that oil that will not go dry. But it's not for the messenger alone. It's for the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Deity &gt;&gt; united with humanity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God, we read the scriptures when God drove them out. So, he drove out the man. This is the when he was expelled, he was driven out. He was divorced. He was put away. That's what the word drove in the Hebrew means. God divorced them. He put them out. He put them away. He had to thrust them out and drive them out of his out out of the midst of that place of perfection. My, there had to be a a way all the way back, &gt;&gt; not part way back. A prophet couldn't do it &gt;&gt; just by himself. It had to be more than that. It took the God man, the man, God Jesus Christ. It took deity being infused into flesh into humanity and the word became flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us and we handled him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This separation from God, separation of man from God required a master plan &gt;&gt; whereby deity or God would once again be united with man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And thus that is why when Jesus said, "I and the father am one." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then took the Jews. Then the Jews took up stones to stone him again. When he said that, &gt;&gt; when he said, "I and my father are one." &gt;&gt; You know, that happens to be the crux of things today. &gt;&gt; People just dislike someone being so assured that they would say, &gt;&gt; "I and my father am one." &gt;&gt; That has implications. &gt;&gt; That has powerful implications. You're saying that God's in you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That goes a little too far. You want to sing, pray, prophesy, speak in tongues, do all of these manifestations, fine. But to say God is in me. &gt;&gt; People today will say that, but they somehow they want the scripture kind of watered down. &gt;&gt; So it's not completely God in you. You can say that and yes, they'll rejoice at it. But then when it comes down, God deity in me. &gt;&gt; That's a different story. &gt;&gt; We need it in its full strength, friends. &gt;&gt; We don't want to back away from it. We need it. You need it in its full strength. You need to confess that is the truth. And those of the scripture when they have to say you know when the disciples the Bible says in and in in fact is in in in John's gospel the Bible says that the people left him when he came to this subject eat my flesh and drink my blood the people said how can how can we do that how how can we hear that and the Bible says that they left him I'm making a point and finally he was left with just his disciples. I want to convey to you, you need to have the same attitude those disciples had when they could say, "We have not left. We are different." &gt;&gt; And yes, we are chosen. And Jesus said, "Have not I chosen you 12 and one of the devil." But we have to be able to say, "I have been chosen &gt;&gt; by God &gt;&gt; to be true." Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been chosen by God to have this revelation. I've been chosen by God to see what I see. I've been chosen by God. &gt;&gt; That's the place you have to come to. I've been chosen by God. I can't help it. I see what I see. I can't help it. I am what I am. I can't help it. If the word says I'm the bride, I am the bride. Sorry, you don't want to claim it. That's fine. But that's what the word says. I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. You must say that. &gt;&gt; You must know that deep inside. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I and my father are one. &gt;&gt; Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. &gt;&gt; Jesus answered them, "Many good works have I showed you of my father. For which of these works do you stone me?" The Jews answered him, saying, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, because thou thou being a man, makest thyself God." There's the crux. &gt;&gt; There's the difficulty right there. Thou being a man make thyself God. See, they didn't understand. They just didn't understand. They couldn't comprehend. And the human mind can never catch it. &gt;&gt; Amen. this God merging deity with humanity. And to this and to this day, there's multitudes over the face of the earth that don't believe that Jesus was deity merged with humanity. &gt;&gt; The God man. Do you realize that &gt;&gt; big population of the earth doesn't believe that? &gt;&gt; Do not believe it. We don't only believe it. And there's a multitudes more that believe it, but they believe it historically. &gt;&gt; Yes, it happened back there. And we remember the babe in the manger. It's not the babe in the manger that we worship, friends. &gt;&gt; And I know that you know that. &gt;&gt; Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law I said ye are gods?" If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came to and the scripture cannot be broken and how often brother Brandham quoted that. Why did he quote it? Because it was pertinent to his own ministry and what the message was conveying to the hearers of the message &gt;&gt; to you and I. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken, say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world, thou blasphe because I said, I am the son of God. In uh in the message that it is the rising of the sun, brother Brandham asks concerning the resurrection of Jesus. Was this was he to be only was he the only one to be the beneficiary of this or are we to be beneficiaries of it? I say we are. He said you are &gt;&gt; to be beneficiaries of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say we are beneficiaries of his birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are beneficiaries of what happened there. &gt;&gt; We are beneficiaries of the fact that God came into humanity. &gt;&gt; That my friends is what's absolutely essential. And that makes the difference between a believer and a makeeliever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A believer &gt;&gt; knows. He knows. She knows. She's had the experience. God &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; is in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; God is in me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That kind of a person &gt;&gt; walks different, &gt;&gt; speaks different, lives different, and is different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Tell you friends, I want you to be enthused with me. If you are enthused, if it's your if it's your experience, this is a glorious thing &gt;&gt; that God created heavens and earth. You say, "I can't grasp that." That's a good thing. If you could understand it, it wouldn't be worth believing. &gt;&gt; They couldn't believe how they were going to eat his flesh. They couldn't believe how they would drink his blood. They couldn't believe. They couldn't understand, but they believed it anyway. &gt;&gt; Brother says over and over, they couldn't explain it. Couldn't explain it. There's a lot of things about the message I can't explain. I haven't been called to explain it. I've been called to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now I want to take and have you look with me because this is an important part of the service this morning. This dual aspect of the person of Jesus Christ, both divine and human. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know why it's so important? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is because that has direct reference to you and I. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are a vessel holding something divine. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we're very human. &gt;&gt; I'm kind of taking off from last Sunday, but you probably won't catch the you won't be able to identify it. There's a lot of folks that will put all kinds of, you know, strong terminology on brother Brandham himself and on his ministry and so on, but draw back from allowing that to reflect onto them &gt;&gt; because it feels it puts them in a in a in a spot where their life needs to measure up. Well, our lives do need to measure up. We do need to live according to the word. That is absolutely for sure. And we need to be real, we need to be real sincere about that. I believe that. &gt;&gt; I believe what he also said. A lot of people want to quote is just certain things, but he said that our testimony and what comes out of our mouth should should match &gt;&gt; our lives and our testimony should match. I I believe in that. But is the flesh weak? Yes, it's weak. It'll always be weak. Does that give allow us to go out and just, you know, just do the things of the flesh and live in the world and so on? No, not at all. That doesn't give that that isn't what that says. But Jesus was man very man and he was God very God. Duel means this. It means made up of two distinct elements having two parts or two functions or two aspects or items of similar kind. We have, I would like to say that two distinct elements. We are certainly flesh and we're very conscious of that. And Jesus was just as much flesh as you are. If he wasn't, then he couldn't redeem your your He couldn't redeem you. He couldn't be your redeemer. He had to be a kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Kinsman. He had to be every bit your kinsman. If he didn't, then he didn't he could not stoop far enough to pick us up and to include us into the plan of redemption. So, he was man, very man. He was tempted. &gt;&gt; Listen, you know how you're tempted. This word says he was tempted in all points. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, most people have Jesus up someplace where he wasn't tempted quite like you. &gt;&gt; That's not what this book says. &gt;&gt; This book says he was tempted in all points. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, people get a little quiet when you come to that because they they want to have Jesus in some in some uh realm that is unreal. Right? &gt;&gt; He was very real. And that's why most of the people didn't believe in him &gt;&gt; because they said, "Isn't this Joseph's son? &gt;&gt; He's worked here. His brothers and sisters are here with us." And so they elevate him to today because it's historical. So we can elevate him into some place that that the people back then did not see him, could not view him. He was they they could see the human part of it. But Jesus himself was completely tied to the divine part. &gt;&gt; Even so, when they said, "Your mother and your brethren are here, &gt;&gt; they're looking for you. They want to speak to you." He said, "Who is my mother &gt;&gt; and who are my brethren?" Now, would that beloved Lord Jesus be disrespectful to Mary? No, he wasn't disrespectful. But his his complete tie, he was completely linked and connected with the divine part. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm bringing something down to you, friends, and I I know that you won't you probably won't get it into the depth I want to bring it to you, and I'd like to show it from the rooftop. We are the opposite. We are so tied &gt;&gt; to our natural our natural background, our natural family, our natural this, our natural that. If somebody said to me, your your your wife and your family and so on is out here, it wouldn't even it wouldn't even clue into my mind for me to say, "Who is my wife? Who are my children? Who is my family? Who is my brother? Who is my sister?" &gt;&gt; Jesus Jesus gave me and gave you the solution to that equation. And he said, "They that believe the word of God, sir." &gt;&gt; And you and I this Christmas day, we need that kind of a revelation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I've seen people so affected by the unbelieving within their own family that they allowed it to drag them down. &gt;&gt; And that is not what God intended. Who is my family? Who are my children? Who are my brothers? Who are my sisters? They that hear the word of God can do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus never there's no record. He ever went back to where he was born. It's religion that's done that. &gt;&gt; He never established the church of the nativity. He knows nothing about that. &gt;&gt; That was not his doing. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen to it. It's absolutely the truth. All of this Christmas business had nothing to do with Jesus. &gt;&gt; He didn't establish it at all. But it was this it it was this dual aspect. Jesus had it. And now it was important at that time because God always had to be veiled. And Jesus was the veil. He was the body that God, the invisible God, dwelt in. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the body by which God could manifest himself in. Now, I know that you you know that some of these things are perhaps elementary, but the scripture says of Jesus, "For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh." It was weak through the flesh. &gt;&gt; That was that one element. &gt;&gt; The law was weak through the flesh. God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's why the dual aspect he had to be flesh man, God man because he knew you were coming. &gt;&gt; You were a flesh man, a flesh woman. He was giving you a a a sign that God deity would dwell within that flesh man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is the full redemption. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil cheat you out of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is why I'll just recall last Sunday. Now I went through the lineage of the record of the record of the birth of Christ. Now now I'm going to ask you some I think powerful question here just now. If God knew from before the foundation of the world that he was going to send that man would fall and he was going to send his only begotten son by a virgin birth by a virgin birth having nothing to do with a man and that the one that would come forth out of the womb of a woman would be neither Jew nor Gentile. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why then is there such a uh I'll say such an intense concern by God over the lineage in the human side. &gt;&gt; Why was God concerned who had who for a son? &gt;&gt; Cuz his son's going to come by a virgin. &gt;&gt; It's going to have no link to this anyway. But God tied his son inseparably to the natural lineage. &gt;&gt; And yet when he came right to the time of the birth, I mean he even we talked about the women that are included in in Genesis 1 or rather Matthew 1, Abraham, why is this important? Abraham begat Isaac. Isaac begat Jacob. And Jacob says this is the generation of Jesus Christ. Excuse me. I'm not being sacriiggious now. When I say who cares he's going to see, he's going to be born by a virgin. Who cares who begat who? &gt;&gt; Why is that important? Why is it important? Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat whoever. Who cares? &gt;&gt; It's going to be a virgin birth. This is just this is irrelevant. Completely irrelevant. Are you with me? But there was another seed &gt;&gt; and it was a faith seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that faith seed was divine from God. &gt;&gt; They didn't have that faith within their flesh, within their flesh man. They had weaknesses. Abraham lied. &gt;&gt; He sinned. He failed. &gt;&gt; But he had a faith. Hallelujah. Listen to me friends. His faith was stronger than his lie. &gt;&gt; His faith was stronger than his weakness. &gt;&gt; His faith was stronger than his flesh. &gt;&gt; He did heed his wife. He did take Hagar. He did bring forth Ishmael. But God in mercy, &gt;&gt; the faith that was in him was stronger than that frailty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He had a faith seed. &gt;&gt; He had something divine. &gt;&gt; It's something that was given to him. &gt;&gt; And so God, that's why he followed. And that's why the lineage was so so absolutely critical critical till it come down. That's why I made you just a wee bit on Tamar. You've heard me speak about Tamar. I the reason I refer to it and the reason I go over it again is some of you have not heard it &gt;&gt; but tamar and that's why we get into we get into areas of the scripture we can't even begin to understand who can understand we call it the grace of god but it was more than even the grace of god in that it was absolutely essential that tamar she had no idea what was driving her she was being driven by an unfor unseen force She had to bring forth that seed of Judah. &gt;&gt; She could not understand it. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, irrespective of what what we go through &gt;&gt; as a believer, I'm talking about a real true son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; I have I care nothing for what we go through. We may go through easy times. We may go through hard times. You may struggle all your life, but let me tell you that your faith in the word of God in this hour has more value to God. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean we become disrespectful to our friends or our family or whatever more. But the thing is you must have your your emphasis your emphasis and the whole focus of your life must be on that spiritual divine part within you. God has given me favor &gt;&gt; with faith in my heart. I believe it and I don't even know why I believe it. I see it, but I don't know how come I got to see it. I see it because God made it clear to me. I can't help it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not because you got enthused in the service. It might have happened in the most quiet time, but God revealed himself to you. And you know where it was when he began to reveal himself to you. That was divine. &gt;&gt; That's something from God himself. &gt;&gt; That's a divine part. You are a dual being in that aspect. &gt;&gt; And Tamar, now she was married to a man for you young people that don't know the name. She was married Judah was her father-in-law. And in those days, you know, quite often there the the a son would be promised to a young woman. And so Tammer was married to Judah's son and he died and the law was in the Old Testament that the then the next brother had to take her for wife and he would not give her seed. He refused his seed to her and God smoked him and he died and there was a last son Sheila and the father was reluctant to give. Well, Sheila was too young at that time and said he so he said to his daughter-in-law, "You go home to your father, put on the garments of widowhood so people will know you're a widow and stay with your father-in-law in your your mother and father's home." So, she went there. Sheila became of age to marry her. But ju Judah doesn't want to give his youngest son because he's already lost two and this is the last even possibility that he will have a lineage through Sheila and it appears that as though Tamar may be a dangerous woman of some sort of thing. there's some danger connected with her and so he refuses to give Sheila his youngest son to her and so she remains as a widow. She hears that Judah is up with his friend shearing sheep not far from where she is and that he must pass through their village and she takes off. Now look, watch this. Watch this. This is in the scripture. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says Jesus Christ is in every scripture. &gt;&gt; And she takes off purposely now takes off the garments of her widowhood and puts on the garments of a harlot. She plans and schemes this thing. &gt;&gt; And I I I want to ask you to ask yourself, what is driving this woman to this extremity? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What's causing her to do such a thing? Because now she looks straight in the face of being stoned or being burned &gt;&gt; for her sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she puts on the garments of harlotry like a harlot and presents herself on the pathway where Judah will be passing by. Judas sees her, desires her, and says that he would like to have a sexual relationship with her is the Bible. &gt;&gt; And before, she said, "Before I do that, what will you give me for this?" Said, "I'll give you a kid. I'll give you a small one of the animals, a kid, a small goat. He said, "Now before you bring that, what will you give me as a sign that you will bring that?" So he has a bracelet and a a staff, I believe it is. And he gives her three items. Says, "Here, you have these three, and I'll send my servant. He'll bring you the kid, and then he'll retrieve these three items. Judah lays with his daughter-in-law, which is absolutely against the scripture &gt;&gt; that we know of. &gt;&gt; Even though this was prior to the law, this was prior to Moses' law. And then he goes and he sends his his friend back with the kid with a small goat. And when he comes to Tamar, when he comes to to the town, he can't find a harlot. So he says to the man of the town, "Where's the harlot that stand sits by the pathway?" Says, "You're in the wrong town. There's no harlot in this town." So he goes back and gives the kid back to Judah and says, "There's no harlot down there." After a season, Judah goes home. And after a short season, word comes to him through the grape vine, "Tammer, your daughter-in-law is pregnant." He said, "Bring her here and I'll burn her." And they brought her to him. Now, here's this man, one of the 12 sons of Jacob, and he's prepared to burn her. And she says, "Just before you burn me," said I have something here. And she hands him his three items and says, "Of this man, I'm carrying a child." And he says, he says publicly, "Tamar is more righteous than I am." &gt;&gt; But now the question, you can never understand that. And you'll never understand. You'll never grasp what was it. What was it that was deposited within this woman that drove her to such an extremity, &gt;&gt; a planned plan? What drove her to do that? I say what drove her was a divine power. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she allowed and surrendered herself to that divine power in the sight of in the sight of burning, &gt;&gt; in the sight of stoning, in the sight of death. She looked death right in the face, but something was moving her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And something, my friends, it doesn't move us to commit sinful things, but something is moving us beyond anything people can say about the message. any persecution or whatever they may do. But I I I need you to see this extremity that she went to. And then you find her over in Matthew the first chapter. You'll recall me from last Sunday. Over in Matthew the first chapter, here she is mentioned. Tamar &gt;&gt; and Rahab the harlot and Ruth the Moabitete and Ba Sheba. These are four women that you cannot reconcile with your own puny little mind. But I want I I need to say to you that there was something of a divine nature sent from God himself because God knew when it would come to the virgin birth. And and you'll recall I I'm making mention now because I want to major on this a wee bit. There's a gap between this natural lineage all the way through. And then Jesus is born of a virgin. There's a gap. This is all a human part. &gt;&gt; And then God, deity, comes down and is united in human flesh. What What has this got to do with all of this for centuries? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; What has this got to do? If God knew it was going to be by virgin birth, why is all of this taking place? Why are these men? Why are these women? Why is all of this lineage? Why are they going through what they're going through in their natural life? What's it all for? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a divine part, my brother and sister, that you do not understand and you will never understand. But it's deity that comes down within the human &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and you'll never never grasp it completely. But in this day and age, I believe that we are God has ordained for us to experience something at this level that we have never experienced. &gt;&gt; I don't care where you've been in church. I don't care what kind of religion you come from. This message contains things you'll never grasp fully. &gt;&gt; But one thing you'll know, you'll be driven. &gt;&gt; You'll be guided by a force. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the squeeze comes, and we can have a lot more squeeze than we've had, friends. We've had things fairly easy, but when the squeeze comes, there'll be a force that will drive you on. Hallelujah. There'll be a force that won't let go. &gt;&gt; There's a power and a strength within this message that will not give in to this world. Will not give in to this chaos. &gt;&gt; The world's headed in one direction. And I can tell you it's becoming more vulgar, more evil, more wicked, and it's very enchanting to the flesh. But I thank God there's deity in this flesh. &gt;&gt; And if you can't say that, friends, and you're in for a big fall, you've got to know that there's something divine that God has placed in you. And you've become a believer of the word. You're believing his voice. You don't know how come you believe it, but you do believe it. &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe it yet this morning, you need to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This gap, &gt;&gt; this critical gap between humanity and the deity. There was one thing about the humanity. The humans, they had one thing in common. They believed God. &gt;&gt; They believed what he said. &gt;&gt; They had their failings. They had their tempestuous times. They had their difficulties. And much so perhaps than even we have, but God allowed their extreme cases. &gt;&gt; So, so you and I who have not had that extreme case. We haven't had the experience of Tamar. We haven't had I didn't have to send a man. I was not ordained to be a king, that kind of a leader. I didn't send a man to the warf front to be killed so I could have his wife. If I did do that, you wouldn't want me as pastor. But that's what King David was. A man after God's own heart. God drove him to that or God allowed him to. And he was driven to that and he took Bath Sheba out of whom came Solomon. And Jesus came and said, "A greater than Solomon is here." If you were going to reason with your mind, you might say, "Well, that's not too much. Solomon was a was a child of a woman that was uh whose husband was killed by a king." &gt;&gt; You say, you might say, "Brother Ed, why are you preaching that way?" So, you can know this morning there's a whole a whole lot of this word you don't understand. You don't know. You'll never know the depths of the grace of God. God is letting you know there's depths of grace that you'll never have to tap in because perhaps you never experienced those things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who understands this Christmas of this kind of God? &gt;&gt; Who understands him? Maybe a lot of people want a weaker God. This word is too strong. This message is too strong. I don't want a weaker God. I want a God that tells me who he is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wanted God in his full strength and his full power. &gt;&gt; And if he could take that lineage of women &gt;&gt; and those men, Abraham and David and and their lives, if he could take them in their natural life and and and and they would bring a lineage down because they believed. They believed God. They believed. They believed. That's the only thing they had in common. They believed. And that's the only thing we have in common. You believe. You believe. You believe. You believe. I believe. You believe. I believe. We have that in common. &gt;&gt; Your frailty and your weakness isn't my weakness. But we all have it. &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God, but we all have frailties. We all have weaknesses. We have things that we despise about ourselves. But that has nothing to do with God's plan and program. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. What a Christmas message when deity comes to dwell in humanity. &gt;&gt; And so God at the end, he's going to send a a a virgin birth, but he takes all of the holiness and all the righteousness and all the purity of the virgin birth and attributes it to them. all the correctness of how it came and everything that this that this seed of the woman would do and bruise the serpent's head and he takes it and attributes it all and places it on this whole lineage of people says I give that to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I give that to you. &gt;&gt; And that's why Paul can say the works of the flesh, &gt;&gt; the works of this natural man that's worthless to God. If it's by works, then he said it's not by grace. &gt;&gt; By grace are ye saved and through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Turn quickly in your Bible to Acts the 2 chapter if you would please. I've referred to this many times over the years, but the reason I go back to it is because I always realize there's a new crop and maybe there's a a new season for someone who's heard it before, but then finally it'll click. &gt;&gt; Oh, finally I got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the second chapter of Acts, uh we'll start at the 25th verse because Peter now in his this is the first sermon preached after the influ infusion of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; into what had been a coward. A man who two months before swore with cursings that he didn't know Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's right. It's absolutely true. And here he is now. He says, "Hear me." [Applause] &gt;&gt; If you were some of those that left Christ, just say, "Oh, well, I think I'll just stick around a while and see what happens. This fellow uh you know, you you know what I heard? I heard he ran like a he he ran like a scared rabbit. when Jesus was being crucified. And now they're claiming that he's raised and we don't believe he's raised and claiming all kinds of things. And so they sit there and listen to him. In the 25th verse, he starts, "Now keep in mind this dual aspect I'm speaking to you about. For David speaketh concerning him, I forsaw the Lord always before my face. For he is on my right hand that I should not be moved. Therefore, because the Lord is on my right hand, in other words, therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad. Moreover, also my flesh, my flesh shall rest in hope. &gt;&gt; His flesh, my body will rest in hope. Amen. &gt;&gt; This David who experienced all kinds of things that you and I are thankful we haven't experienced yet. He was called a man after God's own heart. He had such a repentive spirit and he made things right and he but but he he he just believed God. And listen, because of he said, "Moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope because," and this is why his flesh will rest in hope, "because thou wil not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption." He's prophesying of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But he's he's also God. There's a a divine deity part. Are you following me? a divine part of him. It's uttering right out of the weakness of that man, that flesh. We could say, well, that was before the Holy Spirit. That is true. There's been a lot of things happened since that as well. And we can look around us within the message today. And I just want you to know, friends, that there's one thing we have in common with believers of this message, and that is we believe the message. &gt;&gt; That's the one thing we have in common. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just carry on with the scripture. Thou will not leave the holy one to see corruption. Thou hast made known to me the ways of life. Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance. Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David because that's David he just quoted that he is both notice now dead and buried and his sephilar is with us unto this day. Therefore, being a prophet, David a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne. Now, let me stop there and just look this way for a moment. He's saying David is dead and he's buried. That's a flesh man. &gt;&gt; His flesh shall rest in hope. But he says he is dead. He's buried. And the sepel is right here. Therefore, or even though this has happened, even though he's died and even though he's buried in the seilurse here, but therefore being a prophet and they knew that he was and they believed that and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, the oath, the oath, hear me, the oath or the promise of God that had and sworn to him &gt;&gt; that he believed was stronger than the supplr &gt;&gt; and was stronger than his burial and was stronger than his death &gt;&gt; because he believed God's oath. &gt;&gt; It was stronger than what happened to the natural mind. It was stronger than his weakness. It was stronger than having taken Urias and sending him to battle. It was stronger than that &gt;&gt; because he believed the word that God sent to him. &gt;&gt; It was stronger. &gt;&gt; And because of that, Peter doesn't end here. &gt;&gt; The oath was that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh. according to the flesh, according to his body, of the fruit of his loins, according to his body, that he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne. Now, I want you all just to look this way as I'm coming at it again. If the loins of David had anything to do with Jesus Christ coming, then he wasn't born of a virgin. &gt;&gt; So, how do you handle that scripture? God swore to him &gt;&gt; that of the fruit of his loins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He would raise up &gt;&gt; his son, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; to reign on his king on his throne forever and ever. I'll tell you how that happened. &gt;&gt; Not because I'm smart be because I because you can't go anywhere with that kind of an equation. You can't go anywhere with that kind of a problem. There is no answer to it. The only answer is the only answer is that David had to say within himself, I don't know how this is going to happen. &gt;&gt; How is how is my son going to sit on my throne forever and ever? &gt;&gt; How are you going to live forever and ever? &gt;&gt; How are you going to have eternal life? You don't know. You're getting older every day. You don't know how you're going to have eternal life. How do you know you have eternal life? How do you know you have it? The only way you can know is that you've believed some promise. &gt;&gt; That's the only way. And the only way, the only way, one way that David could know that someone would sit on his throne forever and ever. And God allowed that it would be his own son. And he said that he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne. To sit on his throne. That Christ, the Messiah, would sit on his throne. How would David ever figure that one out? Where is he coming from? this Messiah, the Messiah is going to set. But David believed on it because God, he said, as far as he was concerned, God has swore to me an oath. &gt;&gt; Now, friends, I'm speaking strong language today. But when we talk about this message, people are, oh, the message this, the message that, the message. Hey, the message to me is God's oath &gt;&gt; being swore to me. &gt;&gt; God has swore to me that my theophony is beside me. God has swore to me that one step beyond this, I go to another body. God has swore to me &gt;&gt; that the bride of Jesus Christ will reign a thousand years here on earth. How do I know? I don't know. God has said it in his word and God has confirmed it. God has swore to me. And because David regarded that oath, &gt;&gt; when it come to Matthew 1, it said Jesus, his father was Abraham and David. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God, because he believed, God simply took and attributed &gt;&gt; all of the righteousness to David and God forgot their sin. He never held it against him. &gt;&gt; And you cannot find it in the New Testament &gt;&gt; because it's forgotten. &gt;&gt; And God has swore to me &gt;&gt; according to the message &gt;&gt; that God cannot remember my sin. &gt;&gt; God cannot remember your sin. &gt;&gt; God cannot remember your weakness. &gt;&gt; God has swore it in an oath. And if you believe it, you may have it. If you do not believe it, you're damned. &gt;&gt; If you believe it, &gt;&gt; if you believe it, &gt;&gt; God swore an oath to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I say, Satan will be loosed &gt;&gt; from all of his ability to bring things back into your memory. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit will come now and blow those channels clear. &gt;&gt; Glory. We're a dual being &gt;&gt; and Peter was a dual being &gt;&gt; and he could speak well. Peter knew he had failed &gt;&gt; but he was able to speak with that strength and &gt;&gt; him being a prophet and God swore to him of the fruit of your loins. &gt;&gt; Now here's the key and you won't forget it please. &gt;&gt; The word of God the word of God is a seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said it was the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It happens to be stronger than this seed. &gt;&gt; The seed of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being believed &gt;&gt; nullifies &gt;&gt; and removes &gt;&gt; what has followed you down &gt;&gt; by your genealogy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care who your father was. I don't care who your mother was. I don't care what you've done. I don't care where you've been. But when you receive Christ, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It goes into the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; And you've heard this ter terminology before, but now I'm telling you how it happens. &gt;&gt; Because the seed out of the word, out of the mouth of God, the when a prophet speaks, thus saith the Lord, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. That is a seed &gt;&gt; and that seed is stronger than this seed &gt;&gt; stronger than a human seed. &gt;&gt; Thus I say, I don't care what country you come from. I don't care what language you speak. I don't care what kind of a background you've had. I don't care how many errors or mistakes you have made. I'm not saying that this allows us to live in any loose way. No, not at all. If you are a son of God, you'll live like one. If you are a daughter of God, you'll live like one. You want to be holy. You want to look holy, but looking holy doesn't make you holy. &gt;&gt; Being a nice clean man doesn't make you holy. &gt;&gt; What makes you holy is you believe the word of God. &gt;&gt; And then when that happens, you want to be. &gt;&gt; The life that's in you wants to be holy. You want to dress right. You want to be an example to the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, the man Christ Jesus was the veil. &gt;&gt; The man was the veil. &gt;&gt; And you know what a veil is? Is a veil is to hide. The Greeks wanted to see him in the unveiling of God. The prophet says, "So the Greeks couldn't see him because he was hid from them in a human being." And it's like people coming to church. They came to the disciples. They could come here to church. They could maybe be here this morning. I don't know. they could come and be a part of the congregation and stay here for weeks or months. There's no no restriction against that. But uh and they come and say, "We want to see this that you're speaking. We want to see this Christ." They said, "We want to see Jesus." And so the disciples, they thought, "This is great. We're having a revival. There's people here want to become believers. Come to Jesus and said, "The Greeks here want to see want to see you. Except the weed of corn fall into the ground. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And die, it abideth alone. &gt;&gt; And James probably turned to Andrew and says, "What'd he say?" &gt;&gt; Peter maybe said to John, "John, ask him what does he mean?" This doesn't even equate. We've got some people here want to see him. And he's talking about a kernel of wheat falling into the ground. If it that doesn't fall into the ground and die, it abides alone. But if it dies, it'll bring forth much fruit. What's he talking about? He was telling them what they wanted, what they needed to see. The grain had to go into the ground and die. And when it died, it come forth and brought forth much fruit. And that's the only way the Greeks would ever see him. The only way Le Oysia and we're not in Leodysia. It's the last age, but we're in a bride age. The only way the only way the world can ever see Jesus Christ is through this what he has chosen, this channel, this church, not this particular building. I'm not saying that. I'm talking about the call out ones that he's called by his voice. &gt;&gt; You might say that sounds awful exclusive, just like 11 did. &gt;&gt; But it was 11. It was 11. &gt;&gt; And when it came to Malachi 4, it was one. &gt;&gt; It was one. And we say amen. It was one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when it was Malachi 3, it was one. It was John the Baptist. It was only one. And it was the spirit of Elijah. Only the spirit of Elijah. Wasn't the spirit of Isaiah. Wasn't the spirit of Moses. It was the spirit of Elijah. It was that one. &gt;&gt; Because God made it that exclusive. That happens to be the way it is. And the bride is made up of so many members and no more. &gt;&gt; Who they are. I don't know. But God surely knows. &gt;&gt; God surely knows. And whoever they are, I say amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be part of it. I want to be with them. I want to be in that number. Don't you? &gt;&gt; That's why he came &gt;&gt; deity &gt;&gt; to be united with humanity. Not for him alone back in a manger, but for you today. &gt;&gt; How does it happen? By you believing the word. You'll never be good enough. You'll never do enough good things. But by believing the word, God will attribute everything Christ was to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To me, friends, that's everything. &gt;&gt; That means everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said a veil of his own creation, not a veil of the creation of a woman. Through the womb of a woman, through the womb of a woman. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the womb of Mary that created him. &gt;&gt; The womb of the woman was an incubator for him. &gt;&gt; But he was a creation of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the beginning of the creation of God, the beginning of the new creation. And we've been born by him. &gt;&gt; We're part of a new creation. &gt;&gt; When they ask you who you are, say, "I'm redeemed." &gt;&gt; They ask you who you are, say, "I'm redeemed. &gt;&gt; I'm born again." &gt;&gt; I'm of Christ. &gt;&gt; And God dwells in me. &gt;&gt; We must not back away from that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. another place. I'll tell you what, the prophet speaks strong language and often &gt;&gt; we need to say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said there was no male seed. He said God was the male seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was the male seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who is your parent? God is my parent. &gt;&gt; I have an earthly lineage, but doesn't amount to too much. &gt;&gt; Really doesn't amount to too much. Not many of my family, my father's side, my mother's side, they're all steeped in Catholicism. And I'll never forget them taking me by the hand. I don't know if my sister who's sitting here today was with me at that time or not, but all I remember is some aunt or uncle or grandpa or grandma or whoever it was taking me into the that uh uh some Ukrainian Catholic church and walked and soon as we walked in the door there was a a table with some idols on it. I'm 5 years old. Stepped up, told me to kiss them. I start to laugh. You got to be kidding. me kiss this piece of wood. I've never kissed a piece of wood in my life. And they put their hand behind my head. That's the first time I have some real exercise in neck muscles. I just resisted that with all I was worth. They're just pushing me forward to kiss this thing. And I thought that was the silliest thing. But when I got when I grew up and became a man, I realized that's that very spirit was still on me as a boy. I thought that was absolutely absurd. Why would anybody want to kiss this wood idol? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And many of them stayed in that darkness. Most of them stayed in that darkness. But oh, my heart bleeds for them. But how I thank God for the light. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The veil is what keeps us from seeing God face to face in this church. &gt;&gt; The veil is what keeps us from seeing the angels at their positions this morning. The veil is what keeps us from seeing the angels at their position this morning. Your veil. You need to discard the veil. At least within your soul, within your spiritual eyesight, discard it. And hear what the prophet has said. They're standing at their positions this morning. The angels are here. &gt;&gt; How do you do angels? Welcome &gt;&gt; to Cloverdale Bible Way. Welcome to December the 25th, 205 service. We welcome you, angels. I can't see you, but I know you're here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I know you're here to energize your faith, brother David. To energize your faith, my brother, my sister. They're here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; They're not here as a a wall decoration. They're not here to be like these plants. They're here on a mission &gt;&gt; to energize your faith. The angels are here. &gt;&gt; They're veiled from us. &gt;&gt; All poor veil. &gt;&gt; All this poor, disgraceful, vile veil that we have. And someday we'll shed it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One day it will drop &gt;&gt; and we'll rise to seize the everlasting prize. &gt;&gt; Don't pay too much time and spend too much of your days on this veil. It's still only worth a few cents. &gt;&gt; And they're standing by the seats. &gt;&gt; Are you sitting on a seat? &gt;&gt; A prophet of God who saw beyond the veil thousands of times is telling you that your angel or angels are standing by your seat. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of you believe it. Some of you thinking about it. &gt;&gt; Mighty angels. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Mighty angels &gt;&gt; standing by your seat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Attending to you sent from our father. &gt;&gt; Amen. To look after that deity. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to assist you, &gt;&gt; to protect you, to guide you along the way. And they're at the command of the Holy Spirit, the very spirit of God. &gt;&gt; They're not directionless. They're under specific instructions &gt;&gt; of what to do. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The veil is what keeps us from seeing him. &gt;&gt; We're hid behind the veil, and the veil is the flesh. &gt;&gt; We are sons and daughters of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know what your name is, but we are sons and daughters of God. Do you believe this? &gt;&gt; That's thus says the word of God. &gt;&gt; And if your faith is in the word, &gt;&gt; then all of the righteousness of the word is attributed to you. &gt;&gt; And incidentally, you want to believe it because if you don't, all the damnation of the world is attributed to you. I say, "Oh God, I don't want any of the curses. I don't want any of the damnation. I don't want the judgment of the world. I will believe your word at all cost. At all cost. I will believe your word. &gt;&gt; The angels of God are encamped about those who fear him. &gt;&gt; We are in his presence in the presence of God all the time. &gt;&gt; We are in the presence of God. You say, "Well, my I I have a lot of my life where I don't feel in the presence of God." But the prophet is saying that on the authority of the word that says, "I will never leave you." &gt;&gt; Nor forsake you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the veil is the flesh, and that's what keeps us out of his presence. But through the soul, the spirit, by our faith, we know that he's watching us and he's standing by us and he's here now. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; glory to God. God bless you, brother. You accept it. It's yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's here now. &gt;&gt; You don't have to bring him down. He's here now. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you're the veil. &gt;&gt; You veil him. &gt;&gt; He's veiled in you. Jesus said, "It's not me that doeth the works, it's my father that dwelleth in me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I work and the father workketh and I work hitherto. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here he is as the veiled one walking in the flesh. God Emmanuel, God with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Jesus was speaking these things, except to eat the flesh of the son of man, they said, "Moses gave us our fathers." Moses gave us mana in the wilderness. I just touched on last Sunday. And Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." &gt;&gt; Yes. And with this, I'm going to close. Unless you eat the veil, &gt;&gt; you'll never see what's inside. &gt;&gt; Unless you're able to actually accept and assimilate fully what that is. The prophets of old, I can give it in that example. And Jesus Christ is a better example. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "Except you eat the flesh of the son of man." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And drink his blood and drink his blood. Always eat the flesh first &gt;&gt; and drink his blood because in the blood was the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the blood was the life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you can't cope with the vessel, &gt;&gt; you will never get to the life. &gt;&gt; That's true. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that holds true at all levels within the body of Christ, &gt;&gt; whether it be pastor, &gt;&gt; the messenger of the age &gt;&gt; or the pastor of the ministries, &gt;&gt; the deacons, the offices, the place, and you see somebody rise up and they're belligerent and and and forceful and they had no respect. Uh you know the prophet says that you know we examine everything and so on so forth and they have no conscience and no right and no position. One thing for sure they will never see the deity part. They will never catch a hold of the God part from brother to brother from sister to sister. We need to be able to consume or assimilate to and by that I mean it is by a by a respect and by a an acceptance. &gt;&gt; That is how you consume it. By accepting it, by receiving it. How do I consume the word of God? By accepting it as the word of God. By receiving it, by taking it in. And when we assimilate one another and I take you by the hand, I say, look in your eye and say, "God bless you. God bless you, my sister. God bless you, my brother." It isn't that we're examining one another's weaknesses. If you're going to examine my weakness, I'm going to examine your weakness. We're hopeless. Who is her here that's beyond that kind of examination? &gt;&gt; Who is there any place who's beyond that kind of examination? And that is why those that could not consume, could not respect, could not accept the flesh, the veil of the prophet never come to the message. &gt;&gt; That was their first problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's a standard problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I got that off my chest. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I got that off my chest. And you can go back to the Bible and you can see those so clearly that could not eat his flesh. &gt;&gt; They never got to the spirit. They never got the deity part. They never got his message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But those that stayed with him believed him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I'm glad we believed the true report. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I passed the outer court. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. &gt;&gt; I didn't preach this to make you happy, friends. I preach this because I believe it with all my heart. I believe it with everything that's in me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I want to sing uh and have you stand with me. I want you to sing till the rafters &gt;&gt; sing with you. Let the plaster fall if needs be. We're going to sing down from his glory. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother David Nash. God bless you, family. Amen. I look around, get preaching, then I do see a few more faces. Amen. Nice to have you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Roy, you're going to take off. You're going to take Hallelujah. [Music] All right. 70. Now you understand what this is all about. [Music] down from his glory. Ever glory my God and Savior came and Jesus was his [Music] is allanger. [Music] &gt;&gt; Here's our testimony. Oh, how love. How I adore him. I bre my son, my all in all. The great creator became my savior and all God fullness [Music] [Applause] in him.

I bre my sun shine my heart my [Applause] be my savior and all your soul [Music] [Applause] [Music] Aren't we privileged &gt;&gt; to have one another as brothers and sisters? &gt;&gt; Isn't this a glorious honor from God? &gt;&gt; Thank you for being who you are. &gt;&gt; We can say with Apostle Paul, I am what I am by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; We are who we are. I know one thing. Our desire, your desire, my desire is to serve him &gt;&gt; with everything that's in us. to love him and to pass through into the beyond the curtain of time. We say, and I thought of this especially for those that are of a younger group when I started out and said 40 years ago last night. I know that there's many that say, "Oh, ooh, ooh, 40 years. Oh, that's a long time ago." But just a second just one step in the first moment, the first instant of eternity, 40 years is going to be nothing. 100 years will be nothing. Thousand years will be nothing. You now have eternal life. You now possess it. So look upon 40 years in in reference in relationship to your eternal self, your eternal being. That's not long ago. I come from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going back to God. Was 40 years. You're going to be here for another 40 years. My wife said, driving here, she says, "If we'd have only known we're going to be here 40 years, when we sat in that room, we wouldn't have been able to understand. 40 years we're still going to be here. What if you're going to be here another 40? We won't be. I won't be here. I'll be dancing on this on the shores of hills of glory." But, you know, you say, "Well, there's no way they're going to be here." I don't know. &gt;&gt; Well, what's 40 years? It just that's not even it. It's just gone. It's gone. &gt;&gt; So that's what we're living for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm going to welcome the Timberman's family. That's brother Ry's mother and father. Brother Timberman, I saw you a little earlier. Right here. Right there. Yes. Yes, they've come to dwell in this lotus land. They've come to dwell and they've got their home. They've moved into their home. And I didn't know because I'm not in the first part of the service. I didn't know they had been officially welcomed. But I want to officially welcome you. And thank you for your life and thank you for your family. Thank you for your son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's made a good principle for us. And we appreciate brother Randy and his wife Sharon and uh also daughters with them. Have to forgive me. I don't I try to keep up to all the names but I just not quite able to. But um I'll meet you on the other side and I won't I won't forget a name for sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless the Timbermans as they fellowship with us. We're going to sing this chorus once more and I'm just going to have brother Andy's come and pray a prayer for us. Would you please Brother Andes? Oh, how I love you. I [Music] my heart [Music] be my savior. in your [Music] fullness. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Andy's happy to have you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; It's good to be in God's house this morning, isn't it? Certainly enjoying the word of God. While we was having song service prior to the message, the thought impressed me that we've come to celebrate a marriage. And I thought, how could that be? And then it was impressed upon me that it was a marriage between God being one with his people. &gt;&gt; And uh I certainly enjoyed the word today. Isn't it lovely? &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Heavenly Father, what a privilege and a high honor it is to speak of you as our literal father. What a heritage. A heritage that is passed on directly from you to every young girl, young child, boy, teenager, and adult here that has received the fullness of your presence, the fullness of your revealed word. We pray Lord that what's been spoken today and the full volume of the message brought to us by your prophet William Brham would ever live in our hearts, Lord. Lord, we want to be an example. We want to be your life lived out. And Lord, hear the prayers of repentance here today. laying aside of the old nature and Lord the desire for you to indwell in your fullness. Come among us Lord and continue as we fellowship with family and friends throughout this day. May you be upon our minds and upon our heart. May you not be the one in a manger but father looking upon you as God as Emmanuel &gt;&gt; within your people. Lord Jesus, we love you. We thank you for the forgiveness of our sins. We thank you for new life, Lord, the eternal family. We feel that we're a part of that eternal family of yours here in this building. And Lord, throughout the world, uh there's so many that your family, we feel a part of them. And we pray that your Holy Spirit would quicken every word of yours within their heart. We're looking forward to the time that we can be with them, joined of one heart and of one mind and in a glorified body in that day. Until that moment, Lord, we ask that your spirit continue to work among us and among them worldwide until the resurrection and the ascension that we come to dwell with you forever more. Jesus Christ's name, we ask this blessing and also upon your people and upon your ministry and upon the bride worldwide. We pray that your uncctioning power would rest upon her for the responsibility of proclaiming and pro propagating this message in this end time. Come quickly Lord Jesus. We love you with all of our heart. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. God bless you. Bless you. [Music] How many appreciate brother Andy's and all the work at Voice of God [Music] and his good wife, Sister Andes, and all she has done. We appreciate it so much. That's very very little for us to do when we've sat and read you know volumes of books and to know that you typed and know that you edited. We appreciate it. Amen. We're dismissing you in the name of Jesus Christ. We ask you to have a wonderful time in God's presence. God with you. Amen. Dismissed. [Music]
