The valve did not need replacing, only repair, and [music] this is bringing the family closer to God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for your prayers." Amen. It was a request that we would just please remember [music] our sister Helen Bisberger. She suffered a mini stroke and a possible heart attack on Saturday afternoon, but who was caught early and on time and she's now at the Langley Hospital under observation. She would very much appreciate our prayers for a [music] speedy recovery. And I believe brother Tom was at the hospital this morning having prayer with sister Helen. Maybe we could just continue to lift her up this morning. Brother West Ny [music] Garden, could you come please open the service for us? Let's remember the camp in the upcoming week. Many are already there sacrificing their time to prepare things for us. [music] Amen. I just I know there's a mighty expectation.

Uh I have just a few things I'd like to mention before we turn to the word. Uh we've been in contact with uh brother Dimmitri uh in Norway and I mentioned we have prayed for him and his family and I would like if you would continue to pray for him. There are some complications uh with their time. They're only allowed to be in Norway until September. And I can just say this that the wife and the three daughters have have uh one type of entrance into Norway and able to stay there perhaps uh uh as as visitors and the others as tourists, the father and the son as tourists. So it raises a little bit of a complication, but they would like to uh uh find entrance here to Canada. And uh so we just want to pray for them. Pray also for brother Vladimir and the church in the Ukraine. That's the church that God helped us to build. We provided the funds and the people there provided all the work and they worked so wonderfully. They worked in the bitter winter. I admire them so so much and uh built one of out of a just a like a bombed out structure. But they built a church that is probably one in fact as I to my knowledge it's the largest church in Europe and at its dedication I think there was probably around uh 700 people. I heard there was even nine, but um the numbers don't mean anything to God. But right now, Daetsk, the city that the church is in, is in the eastern part, which is more under the influence of Moscow and Russia. And there's a lot of Russian nationals that are there. And so there's a lot of war and fighting that is going on. And some families have fled. They have gone to different places. Some have gone down to Alooa. Brother Vladimir said in a email to brother Tim Dodd that they are mostly with young children or with teenagers some families but they continue with uh three meetings a week and uh but the the city there is a a lot of struggle going on there and so we just want to remember them. Remember that God hears prayer and God as it was in the Philippines protected for those of you that don't know in the Philippines of that terrible destructive typhoon there was a church and the pastor felt and sometimes it's good to listen to the pastor the pastor felt led to invite the people to come and pray all night and they went to the church and prayed. Uh there were some that had left and they kind of went their own way and it was not good for them. I'll say it that much. But next to the church is a hospital and the hospital is two stories and the church is only a one-story little structure. And in the hospital the water line is up at the second floor above the roof of this church. You can see it in the pictures. We showed it here on the slides. And it's above the it's at the second floor and uh and there was such destruction and the tidal wave tsunami wave went through the whole city devastated it. A city of a quarter of a million people devastated it and the church which is right here and right next to it the hospital and just destroyed everything. this church. How it survived, I do not know. But it was undamaged and there was no loss of life. &gt;&gt; Not one person destroyed. I tell you what, friends, God's in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we believe that with all of our heart. uh sister uh Sephora Chimpac Chapeka and uh some of the family are have have gone to Chad to be with uh brother Jean Chimpaka and uh Sister Naomi and Mila are still here. Uh they're remaining here and I wonder if Sister Naomi and Mila are you in the service this morning? I could see you. &gt;&gt; All right. Would you stand up please for me? Oh, there's Sister Naomi right there. All right. Uh, any of you families that would like to invite them over and give them some fellowship and food, [laughter] I'm sure they'd be very happy. I just thought I'd make that as a public announcement. Uh, I I told her daddy in a I I told your daddy in an email, Sister Naomi, Sister Mila, that uh we would look after you. So, that's how we're doing it. Amen. and uh I'm sure they would love to have some fellowship. Also, I have a couple of great grandchildren here that just get here very rarely and this is the first time they've come together and that is Mea and Naomi Ardal from Atlanta, Georgia. And they're here visiting their cousins Ava and Isabelle and uh all the rest of them there and at over at Leah's place. I wonder I you know uh Mela sang for us once and it was uh it was just so lovely. Touched my heart. I wonder if Mea and Naomi could they come up and sing. Would that be possible? Oh, that would be great. And maybe some others are going to join them too. That would just be fine. Then we have a baptism in the service today after. And I I really love some of these names that uh some of our African sisters and brothers have. Uh I tell you, they use biblical names. And uh this name that's this sister that's being baptized is Sister Precious. Isn't that all right? &gt;&gt; You'll never forget that. And God bless Sister Precious as Brother Tom will be baptizing her. Sister Helen Bisberger had a bit of a mini stroke and uh but a heart attack. I think that you prayed for her this morning and uh brother Tom was up and prayed with her this morning at the hospital and she's doing real well. So we'd like we'd like to just keep you informed and so you can be uh right in the same channel in your prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. How are you? Oh, that's wonderful. God bless you. How are you Naomi? My goodness. Well, here we are. God bless you. Thanks, brother Ryan. [clears throat] You deserve [music and singing] the glory and the honor. [music and singing] Lord, we lift our hands to worship [music] as we praise [singing] your holy name. [music] You deserve the gloryy and [music and singing] the honor. Lord, we lift our [music and singing] hands to worship as we praise [music] your holy [singing] name. For you are great. [music] You do [singing] miracles so great. There is [singing] no one else like you. There [music] is no one else [singing] like you. For you are great. You do miracles [music] [singing] so great. There is no one else like you. There [singing] is no one else like you. You deserve the gloryy [singing] [music] and the honor. [singing] [music] Lord, we lift our hands to worship as we [music and singing] praise your holy name. You deserve the gloryy [singing] [music] and the [singing] honor. Lord, we lift our [music] hands to worship as we [singing] praise your holy name. [music] For you are great. You do miracles [music and singing] so great. There is no [music and singing] one else like you. There is no [singing] one else [music] like you. For you are great. You do miracles so great. [music] There is no one [singing] else like you. There [music] is no [singing] one else like you. [music] I'm amazed [music] that you [singing] love me. I'm amazed how you [music] care. Through your [singing] preious [music] blood, I found pardon. And my [music] sins are washed. They're all [singing] washed [music] away. Oh my sins are washed [music and singing] away. I'm [music] amazed that you [singing] love me. I'm [music] amazed how you care [music] through your preious blood. I found [music and singing] pardon and my sins are [music and singing] washed. They're all my sins are. [music and singing] Let's stand as we sing once again. &gt;&gt; I'm [singing] [music] thank you. I believe you [music] through your preious I found [music and singing] and my sins are [singing] all washed away. [music] All [singing] my sins are washed away. [music] That's my Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We're going to be turning to the word in just a few moments. I I would like to say that uh uh the the camp which is beginning uh this tomorrow starting this week all week and next Sunday there's no service here in the morning. &gt;&gt; It's at the camp. No Sunday service morning service here next Sunday. It'll be at the camp and the junior camp is starting right after the service today. Some of the workers go down, but the registration is tomorrow. So, it'll be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday for the juniors. And Thursday begins the seniors. And Thursday, the camp is completely maxed out. It's the largest I think we've ever had. There's about 350 will be on the camp, including some of the counselors, the counselors and so on. Uh but in the evening is the evening meetings and we want everybody there. Everybody is welcome from here and abroad. Uh brother Craig Bour, pastor of Bible believers of Lima, the church will be preaching. And uh we're impressed how he gives himself to God. And we we should come there with a lot of expectation. I'd like you to have a lot of expectation this morning &gt;&gt; that God will just prepare our hearts and do whatever he wishes to do. But that will be the senior camp and we're so happy to have our brother Brewer and uh I would like you to be praying for these meetings. &gt;&gt; Uh uh I'm going to have you turn in the Bible please to Hebrews the 11th chapter and we'll begin to read. I would also like to say and give a special special welcome to all of our the group that is here from China and those that were unable to come across the border for this morning's service but they will be at the camp. So you'll get a chance to meet them at the camp. Uh and uh it's just wonderful what God has done. In fact is I I would like to say to this congregation to all that are streaming I do not believe I'm I can't help myself. I'm a visionary type of person, but I believe that God has has done uh great things in China, &gt;&gt; but I believe that is just the beginning. &gt;&gt; It is spreading to other countries and what brother Timothy Maul has done in Vietnam. &gt;&gt; We have brother John Lei here today and and his family and brother Joseph and James and their families. We're so thankful that you're here at this time to be a part. This is the first time we've had a whole company of people here, Brother John. I don't suppose when you were over there with your packs sack handing out books outside of some of the three self churches that you ever dreamed we'd be here with the whole group, did you? But I didn't dream about it, but here we are. &gt;&gt; And God bless you each one. We're so happy that you are here. Amen. Amen. And there's another first that's happening this morning. Uh, brother Matthew Dertie has brought about seven uh, Egyptian of Egyptian descent or of Arabic background. They're in the service this morning and up in the room is the service is being translated into the Arabic language for those that are here and we want to welcome you. &gt;&gt; We have a multicultural church and we just say praise God. God God has raised up all these people from all these different nations and we're just happy to be one family. This way it's going to be around the marriage supper, friends. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be Canadian, American or British or whatever more. It's going to be around the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's going to be some of my service this today. We're going to read out of Hebrews 11 starting with verse 8. [clears throat] By faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went. [clears throat] I want to read that verse again and put every person in that verse &gt;&gt; because it is divided into uh sections that include all of us. Anyone who's come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and the message &gt;&gt; by faith Abraham when he was called &gt;&gt; to go out into a place we have been called to a place &gt;&gt; which he should after receive for an inheritance. &gt;&gt; He obeyed &gt;&gt; and he went out not knowing whether he went. &gt;&gt; How many could say amen? That's been my testimony. Amen. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country. We're in a strange country. Dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob. We don't have Isaac and Jacob, but we have a lot of other folks here. And that's who you're dwelling with really dwelling with Isaac and Jacob and the heirs with him of the promise. And that's what we have here this morning is the heirs &gt;&gt; with the promise. For he looked for a city. We can say amen. Which hath foundations whose builder and maker is God. Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who [clears throat] had promised. Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as as good as dead, as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable. These all died in faith, &gt;&gt; not having received the promises, but having seen them aar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. &gt;&gt; I'm [clears throat] going to dwell on the first part of this verse. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them &gt;&gt; aar off, and were persuaded of them, &gt;&gt; and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. &gt;&gt; You can just look this way as I read this verse. It's just one verse out of Romans 4:20. He, speaking of Abraham again, staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God. And one other scripture, Romans 12:3, for I say through the grace given unto me to even to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. And God bless you. You may be seated. I'll need everybody's attention and just as little movement as possible so we don't distract others. This measure of faith is not that God has given you a certain measure of faith. The word measure is it is a an instrument of measuring and you are that instrument. Because God made a promise out here and has given you a measure of faith. You hear the word and then you are able to obtain the promise. I just want you to think of that. Now it is the measure of faith is not that a certain amount is given to every person but it is the ability for you to believe. You are a vessel. You are a vessel that God and you'll see this very very clear throughout the scripture as I speak to you. But it is they the Bible says that they saw they saw the promises a far off. They were instruments of God down through the scriptures and different ones could see. Job finally had vision and and can say, "I know my redeemer liveth and at the last day." He had long range vision. There were others. Moses said, "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up like unto me." That was the measure that was given to him. He it wasn't just a certain measure, but he had the ability to see forward and to speak of that. Now, we have we happen to have promises. It's a very critical time that we live in. It's always been critical for believers, &gt;&gt; but it is absolutely essential that we are able to see the promise, &gt;&gt; to embrace the promise, and to confess the promise &gt;&gt; and to believe that that is the promise that was sent to us &gt;&gt; and a messenger came and sent us and gave us these words that we had not even uh seen or had them quickened to us as such. So it's it's a measurement. It's a vessel for receiving and determining the quantity of things or a rule of standard of judgment. It's a sphere of influence is given to you. The prophet said every person influences someone &gt;&gt; and one influences perhaps more than another. I believe that parents should influence their children. &gt;&gt; I believe that peers peers of the same age or the same group or the same whatever. Young men should influence &gt;&gt; young ladies should influence. Couples and homes should influence individuals just every believer should influence and does influence and that is a great responsibility upon us. Now there is a a quote I want to uh read carefully in why Christ speak so you'll listen respectfully. Faith sees what God wants done. This is in why Christ speak paragraph 161 faith sees what God wants done not just hears this is my words he does it's not just hears what he used to do we're not going to live in the past &gt;&gt; and say well this is what he did 40 years ago &gt;&gt; this is what he did in brother Brandham's ministry this is what he did with the apostle Paul or Peter or the disciples, this is our time. &gt;&gt; This is our day. &gt;&gt; So faith sees what God wants done. &gt;&gt; Not what he has done or what he will do, but what he's done, what he wants done now. Faith sees what God wants done at this camp. &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God wants done today, &gt;&gt; in this service, &gt;&gt; with your life, at this time, in this season. Faith sees what God wants done. It says, "Oh, I hope this goes in." Faith doesn't look at the present time or the circumstances around. Faith's not looking at the circumstances. Faith doesn't see this here. Faith looks to see what God wants and it works accordingly. &gt;&gt; That's what faith does. It sees what God wants and what God wants done. And faith operates through that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Faith is a long range vision. &gt;&gt; It don't lower its sights. It holds to the target. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Holds to the prize. I've said of the high calling in Christ Jesus. He said it's a telescope. It's it's a binocular &gt;&gt; that you don't look around here. You don't use binoculars to look to see what time it is. You don't need a pair of binoculars to look at your watch. &gt;&gt; You don't use that. But you use binoculars to look a way off. And faith does that. Faith picks up God's binoculars. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to be talking a little bit about that. Uh I have I have some binoculars here. And uh these are good binoculars. I can tell you that these binoculars will see an animal off in the distance and uh it'll it'll see a tree stump that you see off just a tree stump, but then you pick up the binoculars and you find out it's a it's an animal. It's a moose. These make all the difference. Uh, let's see. I'm I'm going to have uh I'm going to have some help up here. See, why don't you come up? See where's it? Dave Jarrenoff. Dave, you've looked through lots of these. If you you'll come up and help me here with uh Now, I just want to see. Now, if you look at these the wrong way, you'll see things way down there that are actually right here. You've had that. They've had a look through those and just put them in the most blurred place. No, it's right here. &gt;&gt; What do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; Just see it's all blurred. &gt;&gt; Okay. How you doing? Have you ever used one of these? &gt;&gt; You have? Good. Well, you put them up. These these are super good ones. These are uh these are from Germany. There's his eyes. Is it very clear? &gt;&gt; What do you see? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Blurry. &gt;&gt; Just blurry. He says just blurry. Well, here. Uh, f focus it up. Focus it way out there. Is it coming any better? What denomination do you belong to? Is it clear? &gt;&gt; Well, well, just hold them up. You got to use them here. What time is it? See, doesn't know. They don't help him. He can't say what time it is. Prophet said it's not to say what time it is. You don't use them to look at your watch. You use them for another purpose. &gt;&gt; There's scripture here. There's scripture isn't, you know, it isn't just for the little things around. Well, I I you know, I I I got a pain. That's fine. &gt;&gt; There's promise for that. &gt;&gt; Uh I'm I don't have a job. Well, that's fine. That might be looking a little bit further. And there's promise for that. But then you start saying, "I'm a sinner. &gt;&gt; I feel convicted. I'm a sinner. I feel unclean. I don't feel, you know, somebody here that I see has got something I haven't got." &gt;&gt; Now you're seeing further. &gt;&gt; And you start hearing about a heavenly home. &gt;&gt; You start hearing hear seeing about being born again. &gt;&gt; I was born, but I GOT TO BE BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; And then something starts TO STIR AND YOU'LL FIND OUT THERE'S A PROMISE. YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AND NOW YOU HAVE LONG ARRANGE FAITH THAT LOOKS TO THAT promise and then that happens. &gt;&gt; So I got another pair of binoculars but no use them. &gt;&gt; We made our point. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Dave. &gt;&gt; You'll just remember what we just did. And he says, "And faith does that." Faith picks up God's binoculars. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking by faith. Seeing the promises plural by faith, seeing the promises. If you actually see them for yourself personally, &gt;&gt; you'll embrace it. &gt;&gt; You'll take it to yourself. So I have quite a service here and I I want to make it across to you. He said both sides, the Old Testament and the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Indeed, both sides. &gt;&gt; If you read the science of of binoculars, you'll find out that they're very very unique things because they they they actually put both eyes to work. Not not that you don't have it right now, but they work at it in a certain way so that both eyes get extended vision &gt;&gt; and it's just that's the way they're designed. So he says both eyes, he says both sides of New and Old Testament &gt;&gt; and sees every promise that he made &gt;&gt; and faith sees that out yonder. And faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says. Amen. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what things say around around about us, he looks at the end. He doesn't drop his sights down to look this way. &gt;&gt; He looks out yonder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He keeps the crosshairs dead center on the word. &gt;&gt; That's what faith does. &gt;&gt; That's the faith &gt;&gt; that the man that's [clears throat] in a man that does those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, as something is blurred, it needs to be adjusted and made clear. Now, Malachi 1 said, now we're starting to get into the message, and I'm going to follow it through the scripture. Malachi 1 said, "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in. Behold, he shall come, says the Lord." And Israel had 400 years of quietness, no prophet between Malachi and Matthew. And the first one that breaks on the scene is John the Baptist and the spirit of Elijah. &gt;&gt; And he begins to tell the people, there's one THERE'S ONE COMING &gt;&gt; WHOSE SHOE LATCHED I'm not worthy to undo. &gt;&gt; And this IS THIS WILL BE HIM. &gt;&gt; AND THE people they you know, they knew there was something different. So the multitudes were gathered to him and the and the scribes and the Pharisees AND ALL THE RELIGIOUS ORDER. It happened again happened in our time. But here they people gathered and they were ATTRACTED TO AND SOME OF THEM were even smitten in their hearts and he preached baptism and they came to him to be baptized. You read the Old Testament, there's nobody in the Old Testament baptized that I know of. They didn't gather to Moses or gather to Joshua or whatever more to be baptized like that. But here they come to be baptized and John is baptizing and and disciples come to him. But there were some that saw and they became disciples. They saw something. &gt;&gt; They perhaps could not have defined it exactly &gt;&gt; but they saw something. &gt;&gt; They what they were seeing was the promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; They saw I behold I send my messenger. &gt;&gt; They may not have even known the scripture, but there was something in them &gt;&gt; calling them to him &gt;&gt; TO BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH HIM and to follow him and and and then eventually in a perhaps a short period of time here he sees his cousin, which a lot of people thought was his cousin coming to him while he was in the water. AND HE SAID, "BEHOLD THE LAMB OF God that takes the sin, TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD. Behold the lamb of God." &gt;&gt; And he was pointing the people to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But the but the leaders, &gt;&gt; listen folks, &gt;&gt; the people who were raised in church, &gt;&gt; the people who read the Old Testament, which was the Bible, the people that read it, they actually came to John. THEY SENT SENT PEOPLE TO JOHN and said, "Who are you?" &gt;&gt; They had a pair of blurred binoculars. &gt;&gt; They couldn't see who he was. &gt;&gt; And there was it DIDN'T SEEM TO BE SOMETHING SUFFICIENT. IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO bring them to him, but it was not sufficient to give them vision of who he was. &gt;&gt; They needed it to be adjusted. And and and then if if Satan can get a HOLD OF THAT PERSON, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO IT, &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY THERE'S SOMETHING TO THIS, &gt;&gt; HE doesn't want THEM TO GET WHAT IT IS THAT they have. &gt;&gt; So then he announced that Jesus Christ would come. I'm going to move quickly. THEN HERE WAS JESUS CHRIST. And to some their vision was HE'S BLEUB. HE'S THE PRINCE OF THE DEVILS. HE HE CASTS OUT EVIL SPIRITS BY THE PRINCE OF THE DEVILS. And there are others they could see something different and THEY SAID HE'S A good man. Others said HE'S A PROPHET FROM GALILEE. &gt;&gt; UH IT WAS COMPLIMENTARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. And I'm reading and OTHERS SAID HE DECEIVES the people. &gt;&gt; And then Nicodemus said, "Rabbi, &gt;&gt; you're a teacher." &gt;&gt; He said, "THOU ART A TEACHER that has come from God. &gt;&gt; For no man can do THESE THINGS." &gt;&gt; THOU A TEACHER. SO THOU THE TEACHER, YOU'RE A PROPHET. HE'S A DECEIVER. HE'S A HE'S A PRINCE OF THE DEVILS. &gt;&gt; All of THOSE THINGS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE THEY WERE LOOKING THEY WERE EVEN IN EXPECTATION FOR A SAVIOR. &gt;&gt; They believed IN A SAVIOR. THEY all believed in a savior. &gt;&gt; They all believed they all knew that someone had to come, &gt;&gt; but it didn't it that's what their vision didn't extend to that degree. And then there was there was another one AND JESUS SAID, "WHO DO YOU SAY I AM?" &gt;&gt; And he MADE A DECLARATION THAT HAD NEVER BEEN WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE THE THEY'RE THE CHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; HE GOT THESE IN. HE GOT THEM IN FOCUS. &gt;&gt; Both sides in focus. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE CHRIST, &gt;&gt; THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS HE SAW HIM RIGHT THERE IN THE PRESENT &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS FOCUSED IN WAY DOWN &gt;&gt; WAY DOWN THE ROAD. He could see that HE WAS THE SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SAW. &gt;&gt; AND THEN NOW WE HAVE A PROPHET IN THIS DAY. I getting way ahead of myself, I suppose. BUT WE HAVE A PROPHET AND HE SAID HE'S WANTING TO TELL THE PEOPLE TO TELL YOU AND I &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS ANOINTING LIKE? SAID, "WELL, let me draw a LITTLE DRAMA." AND AND AND THERE'S A LITTLE HALO OF LIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD, YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND HIM. He's too great. &gt;&gt; HE'S TOO MYSTICAL. YOU CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT GOD FILLS ALL TIME AND SPACE. GOD WHO, AS I SPOKE TO MY WIFE ON THE WAY HERE, GOD WHO CREATED EVERY BUG. GOD WHO created every animal and the character of different animals AND THE CHARACTER OF animals within the same specy. You'll find horses one way and other animals uh another way. BUT YOU'LL FIND EVEN AMONGST THE horses or amongst dogs or cats, they have their own individual character. AND AND GOD HAD TO BE all of that. &gt;&gt; EVEN AMONGST THE ANIMAL KINGDOM, GOD HAD to be all of that. And then here's Darwin. &gt;&gt; Poor soul. &gt;&gt; Poor soul. Think of ALL OF THESE FLOWERS and all OF THESE COLORS AND ALL OF THE DIVERSITY and and and HERE WE ARE AS HUMANS JUST AS DIFFERENT AS NIGHT IS FROM DAY AND THE MULTI- MULTIHUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF OF OF of skin that size and everyone has ever been different. &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF A GOD IS THAT? WHAT KIND OF A BEING IS THAT? YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT GOD NEVER. IT'LL TAKE ETERNITY TO &gt;&gt; TO discover him and to know what he is. AND HERE COMES A PROPHET SAYS NOW THAT now to give a drama we can't understand that God like that. BUT OUT FROM OUT FROM HIM APPEARS a a little a light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that light is out of the bosom of the father. &gt;&gt; And we'll call it the logos, the word. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE CREATIVE POWER &gt;&gt; coming out of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and through that power, he's going to create &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; ALL MANNER OF THINGS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LET THERE BE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; Hold that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm going to surprise you a little later on. &gt;&gt; So, he was all of these things, but Peter with the binoculars of Revelation. It's a good brand. &gt;&gt; Revelation's a good make. &gt;&gt; It's a lot better than Ze. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Better than Schwartzki or whoever he is. &gt;&gt; Better than Monulta and all of these others. &gt;&gt; When you have you have eyesight &gt;&gt; of the revelation &gt;&gt; revelation. &gt;&gt; He said you'll never you'll never overstate revelation. &gt;&gt; G &gt;&gt; and by that he could say thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. He said in the me message presuming we also have preachers of denominations great denominations across the nation &gt;&gt; and these ministers preach the doctrine of their denomination. &gt;&gt; Of course they do. &gt;&gt; Presuming that they are doing exactly what's right. &gt;&gt; Presuming &gt;&gt; that they're doing exactly what's right. Many of them, no matter how contrary to the scripture it is, they presume they're doing right when they preach that doctrine, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Let it be whatever it may be. &gt;&gt; They presume that that's just what God requires. &gt;&gt; A certain creed or a certain affiliation. They think that's just all that God requires. They presume that they're taking the people to heaven. &gt;&gt; You know, IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I'VE BEEN TO A LOT of funerals. I've conducted a lot of funerals &gt;&gt; and I've been to a lot of funerals &gt;&gt; and I know the person who's in the casket &gt;&gt; and I KNOW HOW THAT PERSON LIVED &gt;&gt; AND THEY WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH SALVATION. THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THEY WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH CALVARY. &gt;&gt; AND SOMEHOW THE MAN BEHIND THE PULL PIT MANAGES TO PUT HIM IN HEAVEN. WHAT'S HE WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN FOR? HE NEVER WANTED HEAVEN down here. He never wanted God's people down here. AND I'VE NEVER YET NEVER YET HEARD anybody &gt;&gt; put anyone into hell. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Jesus did. &gt;&gt; JESUS TOLD THE ACCOUNT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AND FURTHERMORE, THIS BIBLE, WHEN I LOOK THROUGH THE BINOCULARS, THIS BIBLE &gt;&gt; TELLS me that more deceived, &gt;&gt; THAN THOSE THAT HAVE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; more people are opposed TO THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; according to this word. And the Bible says there'll be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth &gt;&gt; FOR WHATEVER IS COMING UPON THE EARTH. FRIENDS, LISTEN TO THIS MESSENGER. LISTEN TO MY VOICE TODAY. You do not want to be there. &gt;&gt; I do not want to be there. &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, whatever it takes. &gt;&gt; Whatever it takes. &gt;&gt; LET ME SEE THE PROMISE. REPENT &gt;&gt; AND BE BAPTIZED. EVERY ONE OF YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; THAT'S A PROMISE. &gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH VISION TO SEE THAT PROMISE? &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, FATHER, SON, HOLY GHOST. FATHER, SON, HOLY GHOST." THAT'S THAT'S IN THE BIBLE, BUT YOU NEED TO ADJUST THE YOU NEED TO ADJUST IT AND AND get over into the book OF ACTS WHERE THEY WERE FULFILLING THAT SCRIPTURE AND BAPTIZED EVERYONE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO ADJUST IT SO IT BECOMES VERY CLEAR &gt;&gt; WHEN IT BECOMES CLEAR. EMBRACE IT. &gt;&gt; CONFESS IT. &gt;&gt; Believe it. &gt;&gt; AND DO IT. &gt;&gt; HE WENT OUT INTO A COUNTRY HE DIDN'T KNOW, BUT HE believed it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Friends, you might as well say amen. I just started preaching. &gt;&gt; They didn't get focused even by seeing the resurrected Christ. Listen to this. Even by seeing the resurrected Christ. For the scripture says, "And behold, I send the promise of my father upon you." That was one tar in Jerusalem until he be endued with power from on high. Behold, I send the promise of the father. They couldn't see the promise. &gt;&gt; THEY SAW HIM AFTER HE WAS RESURRECTED. THEY SAW MANY INFALLIBLE WORKS. THEY SAW HEALINGS. WHERE'S ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HEARD William Brandon? &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you some testimony here in just a few moments. Where's all these people? WHERE ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE? IT'S ALL A INCREDIBLE INFALLIBLE WORK. &gt;&gt; That vision doesn't give you the full the fullness of the gospel. &gt;&gt; AND SO THESE PEOPLE HEARD THIS, "BEHOLD, I send you the promise of the father. Go and tar in Jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high." A MAN RAISED FROM THE DEAD. &gt;&gt; The resurrection of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And in this day and age, hundreds of times, a prophet of God said, "THIS IS THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION OR THIS IS THE PROOF OF THE RESURRECTION AGAIN." &gt;&gt; WHY? UPON THIS GENERATION, UPON THIS AGE, AND UPON US HERE, WE HAVE RECEIVED THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST SOME DOCTRINES, NOT JUST SOMETHING DIFFERENT, NOT JUST SOMETHING DIFFERENT. CHURCHES, THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You've seen it, friends. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE HAD IT. THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION DIDN'T COME just to give us some different churches. &gt;&gt; The sign of the resurrection never come just to give us some fellowship of a different at a DIFFERENT LEVEL. &gt;&gt; THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION CAME TO UNVEIL JESUS CHRIST IN THIS WORD. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then there was another and and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the father. &gt;&gt; But others had things to do. &gt;&gt; They had families. They had friends or whatever more. They had jobs or whatever more. But this was the most important thing. &gt;&gt; But wait for the promise. The promise. The promise. THEY SAW THE PROMISE AS A FAR OFF. &gt;&gt; Looking for THE PROMISE. NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER PROMISE. I I'LL SEND YOU SOMETHING. I'LL SEND YOU THE PROMISE OF THE FATHER. And they're trying to adjust it and couldn't quite see it. And the Bible says 500 &gt;&gt; ABOVE 500 brethren perhaps more than we have or something like we have here this morning. 500 brethren. heard and saw the infallible works. 120 &gt;&gt; got to the upper room. 120. &gt;&gt; Come on, YOU PEOPLE. YOU YOUNG PEOPLE THAT DO ARITHMETIC. 120. WHERE DID 380 go? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; 320 had a had a set of binoculars, the Old Testament, the New. And they they uh they apprehended and embraced that promise and ended up in the upper room. &gt;&gt; What are we doing? &gt;&gt; I don't know. Peter, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA? NO. I I don't know. Brother Brandham even says maybe they got a good feeling. Said I think this is it. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it's not it. Not yet. &gt;&gt; Waited 5 days, 6 days, 8 days, 9 days, &gt;&gt; 10 days. THEN AFTER THEY'VE BEEN THERE 10 DAYS, THEY'RE KIND OF SOUND &gt;&gt; FROM HEAVEN &gt;&gt; LIKE A MIGHTY RUSHING WIND, &gt;&gt; nothing they did. &gt;&gt; AND THERE APPEARED CLOVEN TONGUES, &gt;&gt; PILLARS OF FIRE ON EACH OF THEM. &gt;&gt; God breaking himself up. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD COMING INTO THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THIS WAS THE PROMISE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE OTHER 380 DIDN'T GET IT. &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T FIND THEMSELVES THERE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEIR VISION WAS CLEAR. WASN'T CLEAR. 120. You can't you It just CAN'T YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT KIND OF ARITHMETIC MAKE ANY SENSE. But friends, I want to be one of the 120, don't you? &gt;&gt; Whatever it costs. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE ONE of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you want TO SAY TO YOURSELF THIS MORNING, &gt;&gt; BY GOD'S GRACE, &gt;&gt; I SHALL BE one of them. &gt;&gt; And the third promise, and therefore being at the right hand of God, exalted, and having received of the father the promise of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; he hath shed forth this that you now see and hear. That's what John is saying. or brother Peter is saying when they SAID THESE MEN ARE DRUNK, I tell you what, their binoculars were way out of whack. &gt;&gt; They all came there for a GREAT FEAST, &gt;&gt; A GREAT CONVENTION, &gt;&gt; A GREAT CAMP MEETING, &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAW ALL THESE THINGS GOING ON. &gt;&gt; THESE PEOPLE SO FULL OF GOD, THEY COULDN'T WALK STRAIGHT. THEY STAGGERED AROUND. THEY'RE SO FULL OF GOD AND WHAT THEY HAD EXPERIENCED. I TELL YOU WHAT, THEY WEREN'T AFRAID OF WHAT THE PEOPLE THOUGHT of them. &gt;&gt; We sit HERE NICE AND STILL AND STEADY. THAT'S FINE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, FRIENDS, THOSE PEOPLE GOT FULL SO FULL OF GOD. NOT FULL OF EMOTION, FULL OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THAT GOD SPOKE OUT THROUGH PETER'S MOUTH TO THE whole multitude until they were pricked in their hearts. AND THE PEOPLE SAID, "WHAT SHALL WE DO? AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's what God plan was. WHAT SHALL WE DO? &gt;&gt; REPENT. &gt;&gt; AND DEP. HE'S CHECKING ON THEIR VISION NOW. &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE WHERE REPENTANCE COME? &gt;&gt; REPENT. &gt;&gt; Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm coming to it in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; AND ALL EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED. You think of the book OF ACTS AND ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT HAPPENED. YOU'D THINK THAT THAT WOULD MOVE ANYBODY. Listen friends, that the Satan you're working through the flesh could give all kinds of substitutes. &gt;&gt; DON'T TAKE A SUBSTITUTE. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "WELL, I FEEL GOOD." HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; FEELINGS VERSUS FAITH. I WAS GOING TO CALL this service. &gt;&gt; And one THING I SEE A GREAT NEED in the MESSAGE IS FOR FAITH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Aside from feelings. &gt;&gt; Well, I kind OF FEEL LESS. FORGET IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The Bible produces, as the prophet spoke, rugged &gt;&gt; men and women. The gospel doesn't produce a bunch of well I don't feel like going or I don't feel like this or I don't feel like be being a part of that or I don't feel YOU BETTER FIND YOU BETTER GET THE BINOCULARS up and SEE WHAT THE WORD OF GOD SAYS &gt;&gt; AND I CAN TELL you one thing the prophet said when the doors open to the house of God you should be there should be waiting AT THE DOOR WAITING TO COME IN SIT DOWN prayerfully and get your heart PREPARED SAY GOD I know you're going to HAVE A MAN OF GOD BEHIND ON the pullpit. I have prayed for that AND I'M WAITING TO HEAR SOMETHING. YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK TO ME &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD HAS SAID I'M A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; I'M A DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO GUIDE ME. &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, WE HAVE TO HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; We must HAVE IT &gt;&gt; AT ALL COST. WE MUST HAVE THAT. And then &gt;&gt; Malachi 4:5 and 6. BEHOLD, I SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET. It's a promise. &gt;&gt; I WILL SEND YOU. BEHOLD, I'll send you. &gt;&gt; Not not Malachi 3, that's John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Now, another appearing of the spirit of Elijah. I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the Lord. First coming was as great. Second coming is dreadful. &gt;&gt; First coming is in salvation, redemption. Second coming is in judgment. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Before the great and terrible day of the Lord. And when the angel out of God's PRESENCE CAME DOWN AND spoke to Zachchariah, John the Baptist's father, told him that he would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and broke the scripture in half because it wasn't the other half. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Wasn't the day of vengeance as Isaiah spoke of the same time. And so, &gt;&gt; but as it was before Pentecost, many didn't have a vision, &gt;&gt; didn't see that. They didn't see the promise of Malachi 4, but they were attracted. I was, my parents were. &gt;&gt; We're attracted along with a few other thousands of people. &gt;&gt; I was in Vernon. I was in Tacoma. I was in uh down in Salem, down in Port Al Bernie, DOWN IN VICTORIA IN ABOUT 30 MEETINGS, 30 different meetings. I never saw I didn't have the binoculars, God's binoculars, &gt;&gt; TO SEE WHO MALACHI 4 WAS. &gt;&gt; Till I sat down one day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And now a mouth speaks the same scripture which I've read many times. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But it come from a different source. &gt;&gt; It was like he was handing me a pair of binoculars &gt;&gt; here. Look at this. &gt;&gt; And I'll TELL YOU WHAT, FRIENDS, I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO ADJUST IT VERY MUCH. IT BECAME AS CLEAR AS COULD BE. &gt;&gt; HIS FIRST COMING, &gt;&gt; HIS SECOND COMING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HERE IT IS IN LUKE'S GOSPEL. DOT IT UP AND ADJUSTED IT. OH, MY FRIENDS, IT'S NOTHING'S BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU SEE THE PROMISE, &gt;&gt; ONCE YOU SEE THE PROMISE, &gt;&gt; everything else is all blurred out there. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST SEE THE PROMISE FOR YOUR DAY, &gt;&gt; NOT BACK IN SOME DENOMINATIONAL TIME OR THE TIME OF LUTHER. LUTHER ADJUSTED IT AND HE SAW THE FAITH the the just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; And that was the whole foundation. THAT WAS HIS WHOLE MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; And people were attracted to it. &gt;&gt; But now WE HAVE, "BEHOLD, I SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET, &gt;&gt; and he shall turn the hearts of the the the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers." &gt;&gt; On top OF THAT, GOD SENT SPECIAL gifts &gt;&gt; to try to get the people to adjust.

Come on. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, THE PERSON SHOULDN'T USE THAT LANGUAGE." I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, GOD uses stronger language. &gt;&gt; If they TELL YOU SOMETHING AND IT'S ONLY A PARTIAL truth &gt;&gt; for the purpose of misleading you, God calls it a lie.

Return home and be well. Say that's just to TICKLE OUR EARS. DON'T YOU FOOL YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A PROMISE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOD'S PROMISE TO FULFILL MALACHI 4 &gt;&gt; TO FULFILL LUKE 17:30. THIS IS A MESSAGE TO THE church &gt;&gt; that John saw in Revelation 3:14 &gt;&gt; AND TO THE AND TO THE messenger &gt;&gt; to the messenger &gt;&gt; of Leodysia, right? these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thus sayith the amen. &gt;&gt; The amen's the beginning and the end. &gt;&gt; TELL THEM, THUS SAITH THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW CREATION OF GOD. I'M ANOTHER SPECIES. &gt;&gt; I'M ANOTHER SUPER SEED. I'M ANOTHER CREATION. LISTEN TO ME, FRIEND. IF YOU DON'T HEAR THIS, YOU'LL DIE LIKE A DOG. &gt;&gt; You'll just go where other multitudes have gone. &gt;&gt; You must believe. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have to answer to this. &gt;&gt; God sent this to you. &gt;&gt; I'm simply repeating what did happen. &gt;&gt; THIS DID HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S TH THAT'S SAYAITH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; IT DID HAPPEN. AND THIS GENERATION HAS TO answer to that. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right, brother. &gt;&gt; Your name's Eva &gt;&gt; and your last name is York &gt;&gt; and you live in this city. &gt;&gt; And your HOUSE NUMBER IS 6136TH STREET, Washington DC. &gt;&gt; Your name's Mrs. Bayer. Like Bayer Aspirin. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Like Bayer Aspirin. And that's right. You're healed. She was in Los Angeles and that was in 1965. 1965 when the great uh theologians were saying he's gone off in the &gt;&gt; end &gt;&gt; because they didn't their doctrine. They were spending their time assuming &gt;&gt; that they're sending PEOPLE TO HEAVEN, ASSUMING PEOPLE ARE getting repentance and GETTING SALVATION, ASSUMING THAT THEIR DOCTRINE WAS RIGHT. And none of them ever did this. I say &gt;&gt; if YOU'RE GOING TO BUCKER, DO THIS. [applause] &gt;&gt; This a lesson to this congregation. &gt;&gt; You hear or say and God help you so you don't give your ears to hear this junk and nonsense. &gt;&gt; But when you do, and then I tell people, AND YOU'VE HEARD IT FROM OTHER MINISTERS HERE, Brother Tom, Brother John, Brother Tim, these brethren, and and there all this community stuff on on Facebook, etc. I got an answer for you. &gt;&gt; God's going to shut it down. &gt;&gt; You say, "Really?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's going to shut it down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you hear these people all the skeptics and all this about God and they don't believe in God or they don't believe in this message or whatever more. Just tell them do this &gt;&gt; AND DON'T COME BACK TO ME TILL YOU'VE DONE THIS. &gt;&gt; You bring me your leader that does this. You bring me the man THAT YOU FOLLOW AND DO THIS. &gt;&gt; AND UNTIL YOU DO THIS, STAY AWAY. &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOU DO THIS, YOU HAVE NOTHING VALID to say. &gt;&gt; Will you do it? Young people, &gt;&gt; young ladies, WILL YOU DO IT? &gt;&gt; MEN, will you do it? &gt;&gt; Remember your commission now. Remember your confession. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THE PROMISE. &gt;&gt; DON'T SEE ALL THIS GARBAGE. WHAT DO WE SAY? OH, WELL, THERE'S A GARBAGE DUMP OUT THERE. YEAH, WELL, why don't you all go and see it? It's it's a great big garbage dump. Vancouver has a big garbage dump. &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, there isn't anything in the garbage for me." That's exactly right. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; These skeptics haven't got anything for me. These guys with all this criticism of the women OR WHATEVER MORE, THEY HAVEN'T GOT A THING. &gt;&gt; THEY HAVEN'T GOT A STUMP TO STAND ON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'm not even asking you to forgive me. I'm not going to apologize for what I'm saying. [applause] &gt;&gt; Your name is Mrs. Wolf. That's number nine. &gt;&gt; In Topeka, Kansas in 1964. You're a reverend. It's number 10. &gt;&gt; I just give you 10. &gt;&gt; I could have given you some hundreds, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But I'm just giving you 10. &gt;&gt; You're a reverend. You're a minister. &gt;&gt; I see you at the pulpit. &gt;&gt; You do? &gt;&gt; I see you AT THE PULPIT. WHO IS THIS PERSON? &gt;&gt; Who is this man? You think William Brandham saw HIM AT THE PULPIT? NO. THE GOD THAT WAS SPEAKING THROUGH HIM was giving him sight beyond his mind. Has nothing to do with the human mind. I SEE YOU AT THE PULPIT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. And then he said something and the man says, "Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Believe with all your heart and God bless you." And the man spoke up and said, "That's 22 years ago &gt;&gt; that he stood behind the pulpit." &gt;&gt; And here's a prophet standing in THAT MOMENT SAYING, "I SEE YOU BEHIND THE PULLPIT. &gt;&gt; WHERE WAS HE IN ETERNITY IN ANOTHER DIMENSION? &gt;&gt; Bring me another man. BRING ME YOUR PRIEST. Bring me your rabbi. bring me anybody and have him do this. &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't do that, SAY, "WELL, THERE'S OTHER PROPHETS." BRING THEM HERE. &gt;&gt; And if they DON'T DO THIS, YOU'RE OBLIGATED TO HEAR SOMEBODY WHO SPEAKS TRUTH. &gt;&gt; All this was done. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thought of your message, brother Don. Brother John, when you turn, he didn't know. He was I was already deep in my message. And brother John goes to Malachi 4. He says to turn to cultivate is to dig deep. &gt;&gt; And I thought, that's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll send you Elijah the prophet &gt;&gt; and he'll dig deep. Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll turn your heart. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T CARE WHERE YOUR HEART IS. HE'LL TURN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; HE'LL TURN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; Which the SCRIPTURE ALSO SAYS IS WICKED. &gt;&gt; THE HEART IS WICKED. &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL SEND A WORD &gt;&gt; AND A PROMISE THAT WILL TAKE THAT WICKED HEART &gt;&gt; AND TURN IT. &gt;&gt; THE HEART THAT IS STEEPED IN PRIDE AND TURN IT TILL YOU BEND the knee. [cheering] SAY, "GOD, FORGIVE ME. &gt;&gt; JESUS, FORGIVE ME. &gt;&gt; Turning my heart. &gt;&gt; I ALWAYS FELT I WAS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. &gt;&gt; Listen to some OTHER MAN THAT HASN'T GOT ANY VINDICATION WHATSOEVER." And here you bring THIS RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY TO ALL THAT ARE streaming &gt;&gt; and all that are in this building or under the sound of my voice or will ever hear this voice, &gt;&gt; let it be known to you. &gt;&gt; God arranged you to be here. &gt;&gt; God arranged for you to hear these words. &gt;&gt; In a message why I'm a holy roller, &gt;&gt; brother Bam talks about a man Joel. He's speaking 53. And he said, Joel, God put a binocular on his eyes &gt;&gt; one day and he looked DOWN THROUGH THE STREAM OF TIME &gt;&gt; YONDER. HE SAW the church. &gt;&gt; He seen this vine tore down. &gt;&gt; He saw it destroyed. &gt;&gt; And he said, "What the palmer worm left, &gt;&gt; the caterpillar is eaten. And what the caterpillar has left, the locust has eaten. &gt;&gt; And what lot what the locust at eat another worm has eaten. &gt;&gt; He said, "Could this church ever grow again?" &gt;&gt; But God said, &gt;&gt; "I WILL RESTORE, SAYETH the Lord." And Joel had enough had enough of God in him as A PROPHET TO EMBRACE that promise &gt;&gt; and said, "I BELIEVE THAT PROMISE." &gt;&gt; God will restore. &gt;&gt; I will restore, says the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, we need to believe that even now &gt;&gt; we're in that restoration. A lot of people have taken the restoration and this redemption and what the messenger said and just made it into a like a little gathering. &gt;&gt; This is not here so you can just come and have a comfortable afternoon. &gt;&gt; Or say, "Well, I've been to church THIS MORNING." THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. That doesn't mean ANYTHING TO GOD. WHAT KIND OF LIFE DO WE LIVE &gt;&gt; after you've left church? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All this was done to turn the heart. And he says, uh, I will restore, say the Lord. And Joel the prophet, he said, looking down through the eyes of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm preaching to you today. Don't look through these eyes &gt;&gt; or hear what these ears hear. &gt;&gt; God's not depending on that. And that's not what he's using. &gt;&gt; Eyes of faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And looking down through the eyes of faith, he saw the vine coming up out of Genesis." &gt;&gt; He saw it all as far away they he said there after the Jerusalem, thereafter Jerusalem, the Holy Ghost fell. &gt;&gt; He seen the dark ages coming on. He seen the vine destroyed &gt;&gt; and pushed down to a stump. And but God said, "I will restore, say the Lord." When you look through the eyes of faith, it doesn't mean whether you see a see the vine coming up strong and fruitful or whether you see it being destroyed, CUT DOWN, PUSHED INTO A STUMP AND THE LIFE GOES BACK DOWN. BEING A PROPHET, he knew that the word of God, &gt;&gt; the word of God is creative &gt;&gt; and the life goes back down to the roots &gt;&gt; where no one can find it. Right. &gt;&gt; And that's why it says of Jesus Christ that he's both the he's both the branch and the root of Jesse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They couldn't destroy him. They tried to put him into a coupe &gt;&gt; called a sephilar. &gt;&gt; AND THEY PUT HIM THERE dead and lifeless, &gt;&gt; BUT THEY COULDN'T GET TO THE ROOT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THEY MIGHT DESTROY THIS BODY. THEY MIGHT BURY YOU IN THE GRAVE, BUT THEY CAN'T GET TO THE ROOT. &gt;&gt; YOUR FAITH. WHAT YOUR FAITH IS ANCHORED IN. &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T GET AT YOUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "If it wasn't for that, you might be able to kill the branches, but the life is in the church." Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is in Jesus, which is Jesus Christ, the lamb slain from the foundation of the earth, &gt;&gt; God will restore &gt;&gt; back to the word Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the purpose of hearing the word and thus receiving rapturing faith. Friends, I was I've been yeah struggling I guess is the word striving. So you say say God I want to bring the promises for this day to these people promises that you have made. I will do it. You've been hearing the word as believers of the message and the people today assume all kinds of things and it's simply assumptions and people run off after run out after all kinds of opinions. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, I heard this. It sounds good. Sounds what? Sounds good to what? &gt;&gt; To who? &gt;&gt; To your brain. &gt;&gt; Your mind. It's got to be something within the soul. &gt;&gt; Not something that just tickles up and down your spine. Not not something because it's just new. &gt;&gt; Something because it's from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has proven himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's in the scripture. &gt;&gt; People have opinions on the horse riders in the book of Revelation. &gt;&gt; Have the opinions on the horse riders and can tell you what the horse riders are. And how can you be so different? Are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; You can read it if you want to go on the internet and Google and whatever more and they'll have you the horse riders and they'll say the horse riders on a white horse and it's the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And the prophet comes and says, "It's the devil. &gt;&gt; Who you going to take sides with?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, this man says the Holy Ghost. I'm not too sure. And a doubt comes. Are you going to listen to that or are you going to listen to someone who tells people their names and their addresses? &gt;&gt; As a sign, and he tells you, furthermore, it's not me. This is Jesus Christ saying this. &gt;&gt; I don't know these things. &gt;&gt; Are you going to believe that and embrace that? &gt;&gt; This is God speaking to me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And he says, "No, that's the devil. &gt;&gt; He's out to deceive. &gt;&gt; He's out writing in his deception." And furthermore, I want to say to you, he's been very successful in his deception. And he will be because the scripture tells us in Revelation, the same book that they're looking at, that all whose names are not written in the book of life will worship him. Don't catch yourself in that group. &gt;&gt; Don't find yourself in that group. &gt;&gt; They have opinions on the Antichrist. All kinds of the opinions. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I listened to a man on the radio some years ago and he was going to open the seals and that's published. He's opened the seals. You never heard of it and a lot of other people never heard of it. Brother Brandham spoke on spoke the seals. They have all kinds of opinions on the Catholic Church. They have all kinds of opinions on Russia. They have opinions on the coming of the Lord and the different beasts. but completely missed what John saw &gt;&gt; when John saw Christ. &gt;&gt; And John said, "And I saw I saw &gt;&gt; another mighty angel &gt;&gt; COMING DOWN FROM HEAVEN." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And he has over his head a rainbow, &gt;&gt; WHICH IS GOD'S PROMISE &gt;&gt; TO NOAH. &gt;&gt; HE HAS A PROMISE OVER HIS HEAD. &gt;&gt; HE'S A GOD OF PROMISE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I SEE THIS CHRIST COMING &gt;&gt; AND ALL OF THESE THEOLOGIANS MISS IT. &gt;&gt; You know why? &gt;&gt; Their binoculars aren't lined up. &gt;&gt; Well, I learned it in Bible school. I'm sorry. You better turn the knob. &gt;&gt; Well, that's what my church teaches. You better turn the knob. &gt;&gt; You better GET IT FROM A VINDICATED PROPHET. And he says clearly, he's descending &gt;&gt; and his feet are like brass, &gt;&gt; like burning. And that's the way he's described in Revelation 1. &gt;&gt; And his voice is like that of thunders. &gt;&gt; And he speaks &gt;&gt; and puts one foot on the sea and one foot on the land. &gt;&gt; He's in control of everything. &gt;&gt; This is him. Uh and the seventh verse says, "But in the days of the seventh angel or the seventh messenger, when he shall begin to sound, &gt;&gt; all the mystery of God should be finished." Why? Because now he's got a valid, &gt;&gt; proven, &gt;&gt; vindicated voice on the earth. &gt;&gt; And when HE PUTS A VALID, VINDICATED VOICE ON THE EARTH, it's for you as a human to hear it. I didn't say understand it. Hear it. &gt;&gt; Embrace it. &gt;&gt; Confess it. &gt;&gt; And if you confess it, you will possess it. &gt;&gt; In fact, I'll tell you, it's your only way out of here. [applause] &gt;&gt; Listen, folks, grow up. &gt;&gt; LET'S MATURE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LIVING down here in a bunch of froth &gt;&gt; and just a bunch OF EMOTIONALISM. WE'RE LIVING UP HERE IN HEAVENLY PLACES &gt;&gt; WHERE JESUS CHRIST HAS BEEN MADE REAL, ALIVE. &gt;&gt; Everybody ought to raise their hand. &gt;&gt; Say, I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the seven church ages, he says, "When I look, &gt;&gt; that'd be a good place for you to look. When I look said, I see the nations broke. &gt;&gt; I see politics broke. &gt;&gt; I see the homes broke. &gt;&gt; I see the church broke. &gt;&gt; Now there's just nothing else can mend it but God. &gt;&gt; And that's all cuz they have not nothing else. The morals of the nation is broke. And the political parties are broken. &gt;&gt; Where we trusted so much in our politics, they are broke. &gt;&gt; And every kingdom of this world will be broke in pieces. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ will rule and reign. &gt;&gt; If this were my last message, I'd want to preach it this way. &gt;&gt; You got faith in your government. Are they going to fix things? You know they're not. &gt;&gt; You think the world can solve it? Listen, I'll just give you a paradox. This last week, &gt;&gt; this last week, this isn't ridicule. Not a bit. I respect the leaders, but this last week, the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the United States of America, Mr. John Kerry, a man of power, a man of great persuasion and in influence in the world, journeys to Israel. The president of the United Nations, Mr. moon. The president of the world body travels to Israel because there's been a few hundred people Palestinians killed in Gaza. You're normal people. Israel, Israel simply says, "Stop sending the rockets &gt;&gt; and we will stop invading." &gt;&gt; The invasion has cost a lot of lives. Of course, Israel doesn't want Gaza. They don't want to see people killed. &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking on their behalf. I'm just saying what's happening. This is what's happening. &gt;&gt; Israel says, "Stop sending the rockets and we'll stop immediately." &gt;&gt; Israel and Hamas have said, "We will give the people, they agreed to give the people 12 hours so they could get food and so on and so forth." After 12 hours, which has just passed, Hamas has started sending rockets into Israel. But Israel said, "No, we will we will not yet do anything. We're going to continue with a a ceasefire. In the meantime, here's Mr. Kerry. Listen to me now. I don't care what your opinion is. I'm just telling you what's happening. &gt;&gt; Mr. Carrie and Mr. Moon, the president of the United Nations, they go where there's several hundred people killed and it's sad and children are killed and mothers and and and people are and they went over there and found themselves they found rockets stored in in in a in mosques, etc. Nevertheless, I'm not getting in the middle of it. I'm just telling you what happened. Now, I'm asking you a serious question. I want somebody to tell me, what spirit is directing those men? When in fact, not hundreds, but thousands. &gt;&gt; Almost a hundred,000 have been killed in Syria. &gt;&gt; Did Mr. Moon go to Syria? &gt;&gt; Did Mr. Carrie go to Syria? No. But to go to Israel, soon as it's Israel, &gt;&gt; listen to me now. Serious friends &gt;&gt; because this goes much deeper. This isn't politics. Politics is broke. &gt;&gt; You understand? Politics is broke. &gt;&gt; But why? I I ask you the question. You go home and ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION, WHY DIDN'T they go to Syria where thousands are being killed, CHILDREN ARE BEING KILLED, A million are up in Turkey in camps &gt;&gt; living under terrible conditions. &gt;&gt; Why didn't they go there? &gt;&gt; Because this prophet is correct when he says every government is of the devil. &gt;&gt; Every government. &gt;&gt; You don't want to stay here, folks. You don't want to say they haven't got the answers. &gt;&gt; Why do they go to Israel? Because that happens to be where God began to deal with a man by the name of Abraham &gt;&gt; as one man. Started with Abraham and out from him came seed until it became an innumerable amount of people. And the Bible says &gt;&gt; and they said they saw the promises of God a far off. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; AND THEY HELD AND EMBRACED THOSE PROMISES. They never inherited the land. They never got anything for it. &gt;&gt; They didn't have the kind of life you and I lived. &gt;&gt; Many of them lived as poppers. Many of them were imprisoned. Many of them suffered many things. But the Bible tells US THEY LOOKED A FAR OFF. THEY WERE destitute &gt;&gt; and they were imprisoned. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE SUS &gt;&gt; AND SUFFERED HEINOUS THINGS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; But they saw the promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A far off &gt;&gt; of whom the world is not worthy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and they held to those promises. &gt;&gt; And now God has given us some promises, friends. &gt;&gt; When we talk about Revelation 10:1, go and read it. Maybe some of you don't even know what it says. But I saw another mighty angel descending from heaven. That's not just a story book phrase. That happens to be a promise. &gt;&gt; GOD OUT OF WHOSE BOSOM CAME CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE HAD IN HIS MIND ONE DAY HE WILL RETURN BACK TO THE EARTH when it's a great scientific age. I'm going to talk about the scientific age. Want everybody watching. I've got a few slides. This first one is by faith Abraham. And then then I want to get right down where you live. By faith, Abraham. Can we dim the lights a wee bit, please? Are there? And if we need some help up there. Okay. By faith, Abraham when he was called to go out. The word here is called. How many here were called? I got I got a little a little something for you. A call isn't something where you just hear it in the morning or or hear in this service. You hear a voice, you hear the preaching and it stirs your heart. It may be that, but it's even deeper. &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; Prophet God, I want to touch your soul. Now, prophet God says it'll be a little uh ducks will go from Louisiana where brother John and his family are living now down Louisiana. They'll fly all the way up to the Arctic and in the marshes of the Arctic, they'll make nests. You understand that? They'll lay eggs and hatch them. And out comes little ducklings. And brother Brandham says those ducklings, they they swim out in a little pond. They don't know any other pond. That's the only pond they've ever known. Your pond. You don't know any other pond. This is where I was born. This is where I was raised. I was raised. I was born in a certain country. I was raised. You ate off that pond. That's all you know. And then, are you listening? And then the snow and the frost comes on the hills and a little breeze comes down &gt;&gt; and it's a little chilly cold and that little duck will put his bill up in the air honker. Brother Brenham calls it and at the smell of that her honker he'll give a couple quack quack quack quack and all the others all the others know that he's a leader. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT? something in them says he's a leader. &gt;&gt; And they all swim over to him &gt;&gt; and he hears that wind AND THERE'S A CALL IN HIM. &gt;&gt; WHERE DID IT come from? &gt;&gt; AND HE TAKES OFF TO THE SKIES AND AS STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW, HE FLIES to Louisiana. &gt;&gt; Where he's never been, &gt;&gt; HE'S NEVER SAW IT. &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, FRIENDS. YOU HEARD THIS MESSAGE. YOU DIDN'T JUST HEAR A PREACHER. YOU HEARD A CALL FROM ANOTHER PLACE. A CALL FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION AND A C IN THE COLD WINDS OF THIS WORLD AND THE VIOLENCE AND THE TROUBLE. AND I TELL YOU, ONE DAY, ONE DAY BY GOD'S PROMISE, EMBRACE IT. HOLD IT. You'll take off from here as straight as an arrow into an eternity INTO A PLACE, A PLACE PREPARED for you. Jesus said, "I go to prepare a place for you." &gt;&gt; Are you one of them? &gt;&gt; Are you one of them &gt;&gt; on the balcony? Are you one of them? &gt;&gt; Do you embrace that for yourself? &gt;&gt; I prepare this place for you. &gt;&gt; If you don't want it, you can just go to a casket. &gt;&gt; If you don't want it, you can just remain here for tribulation. promise. &gt;&gt; Promise of God. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment. Is there anything in here is calling out? That thing that's calling is not just to escape the pond. It's not just to escape the frost, not just TO ESCAPE THE COLD WEATHER. It's to preserve their life. &gt;&gt; And something in THEM, HE'S NEVER LEFT THERE. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE LOUISIANA IS. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HEAVEN IS, BUT I'M GOING THERE. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; THAT THING THAT CALLED ME, &gt;&gt; THAT THING THAT ANCHORED IN MY HEART, HE'S STILL GUIDING ME HERE. THE UNSEEN HAND. He should after receive for an inheritance he obeyed. He went out not knowing whether he went &gt;&gt; like where you are today. He sojourned in a land of promise as in a strange country. &gt;&gt; Dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the promise. Now, we're going to take a quick turn. Two years ago, this happened on July the 22nd of 2012. about 24 months ago. This is the sun and down here is the Earth. That's the scale. And this that came out is a huge explosion from the sun traveling at 6,4 6,480 miles an hour. 1,800 miles a second. It was a a satellite that took the picture and the satellite was struck straight on. This isn't some thing to startle you, but it is startling. I I thought about it most of the night. And this is what scientists NASA is very involved in this. NASA, the satellite that took this picture was a NASA NASA satellite. And they've said that while you didn't see it, feel it, or even read about it in the newspapers, Earth was almost knocked back to the Stone Age on July the 23rd, 2012. These are out of newspapers, out of the Kansas newspaper, out of the Florida newspaper, several of the newspapers. Almost two years ago to the day our most bountous and fantastical celestial body, the sun, kicked out one of the largest solar flares and coronal mass ejections ever recorded. And it missed the Earth by a whisker. If it had hit, we would still be picking up the pieces, says Daniel Baker, who led the research into the massive solar storm. It was on July the 22nd, 2012 that NASA's Stereo A spacecraft spotted what looked like an enormous solar eruption sending out a coronal mass ejection at blazing top speeds of roughly 1,800 m per second or 6,480,000 mph. per hour, the fastest ever recorded by the spacecraft. By the time it actually passed stereo A, a mere 17 hours later, the magnetic cloud was still traveling at 750 m per second or 2,700,000 per hour. Had the event hit the earth, it would have produced a record geomagnetic storm. It missed the earth by about 10 to 15 minutes. Everything shuts down, Casey said. Without electricity, there is no manufacturing, no medicines, no processed food, no gasoline could be refined or even oil drilled. Your cell phone is instantly worthless. There's no phones. There's no communications. The earth was struck by one of these in 1859 and it was a gentleman by the name of Carrington that uh was the it was called the Carrington event 1859 we didn't have computers [snorts] we didn't have all of this scientific civilization and this prophet spoke about the scientific civilization and finally said and said more than one place. Listen now. He said that world I go to prepare a place for you. He said that world will have none of the scientific things. &gt;&gt; It'll be so far beyond this. &gt;&gt; I want you to think now because you are the residents of this civilization. And I felt led to say this. And in that in that there was only telegraph wires. And the telegraph wires were actually fused by the by the force of this magnetic thing. And the women that were sitting taking telegraphs and their they had their notepads in front of them. They said things sparked and the notepads caught on fire. And after the batteries were burned out, completely burned out, they could still hear the voices going by the effect of this sunburst. But they said if one happened today, and this is what all the newspapers use, they said it would literally unplug the planet. You that have electric stoves, you wouldn't turn it on and cook dinner and your fridge would immediately begin to deteriorate. Your deep freezes would begin to spoil the food. And those of you who don't know how to make a fire would have a hard time cooking anything. This is precisely and this is this is so such a reality today that in the Washington and then amongst the Senate and so on they have debate going on and discussions going on about how to harden [clears throat] the electrical systems and they're telling the electrical providers that you must take take steps to harden the system somehow and protect it against such a a last. They said that there's a 6% chance that the Earth would have a direct hit within the next 10 years. You know what I think? I think that our God who loves righteousness and hates iniquity hates this scientific age. And I was just reading this on the computer and then there's some pictures and maybe maybe you would also like to turn to these. Maybe you'd also like to read these. It's only about six of them. One of them is a woman advertising her that what it what the event was when she announced she was a lesbian. That's exactly why God's going to destroy it. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry you saints from China. Maybe this isn't what you came to hear, but this is the age we're living in. It's a wicked age. The same devil that's in America is in China. The same devil that's in China is in Europe. &gt;&gt; The same devil's in Russia and the Ukraine and wherever more. It's the same evil spirit. And friends, I want to say to you modern people, don't get caught up in this modern world. &gt;&gt; Your scientists are saying it could be back to the stone age in just a moment. Right. &gt;&gt; And perhaps this is a warning &gt;&gt; that God is giving to people who will hear. This could happen in just a moment. What would you do tomorrow morning? Well, I'll go to school. No, you wouldn't go to school. There's no lights. Remember, can you imagine all the hospital equipment that shut down and the people waiting for emergency operations and there is no such a thing? Friends, you think that this is some kind of story? This is what science is telling us. The very science that produced us is telling us what it could do. &gt;&gt; And God, when he said, "Let there be light," &gt;&gt; he knew every flare that would come out of that. He knew where it would go. &gt;&gt; And if it if it strikes this little planet, &gt;&gt; it'll not merely be a wakeup call. You your mind cannot grasp or comprehend what that would do. &gt;&gt; I've been thinking about it for the last several hours, for a day or two. This is the structure of what it would affect. The oil and gas, communications, the water, the banking and finance, ATMs wouldn't work, government services, emergency services, transportation, electric power. Can you imagine planes not flying? If that had happened or does happen, people are on one side of the world will remain there because I guarantee you there's no flights back. They said that it would affect no less than 130 million people. They're just showing some of it there. The these are not my findings. God give you faith to receive the promises. And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring. &gt;&gt; Men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming &gt;&gt; on the earth. For the powers of the heaven shall be shaken. &gt;&gt; Moses faith led him to watch what would be, not what was. Looking at tomorrow instead of today. Look at the promise instead of the glamour. &gt;&gt; Look at the people instead of the organization. &gt;&gt; Lot could see the glamour of prosperity down in Sodom. Lot could see the possibilities of a of of a lot of money. Lot could see the possibilities of when he looked over to Sodom and he could maybe become maybe that he was a Hebrew, he might become a great man there because he was a great intellectual figure and the nephew of Abraham. So he chose to go towards Sodom. Lot's intellects led him to see the glamour of prosperity. &gt;&gt; Lot's intellects, you have to do what you want to do with these. &gt;&gt; Lot's intellects led him to see the blessing of glamour, but his faith was so paralyzed &gt;&gt; by it. He didn't see the fire that was going to destroy that sort of a that sort of a life. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I am not saying and I'm not here to be an alarmist, but I'm here to be a realist. &gt;&gt; This is God's word. &gt;&gt; This isn't NASA speaking now. This is God's word. I don't care whether it comes from the sun or just out of heaven, but God caused SOMETHING TO COME. FIRE CAME FROM heaven &gt;&gt; and destroyed SODOM AND GOMORRAH AND THEY NEVER BEEN RAISED UP. &gt;&gt; God's got all kinds of ways he can do things. And the same God THAT DESTROYS ONE ALSO GIVES LIFE TO ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROMISE OF GOD SAYS YOU ARE A SON and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You believe that? And he said furthermore that the reason why the reason why the faith worked for Jesus is because he knew where he came from and he knew who he was. &gt;&gt; And he SAYS EVERY BELIEVER HAS TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; AND if you KNOW THAT YOU'RE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD, THEN YOU CAN EXERCISE FAITH. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. YOU CAN EXERCISE FAITH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN GET ON THE ON THE phone to and tell them to pray with you. That may be fine. But it's you'd have to know who you are, where you CAME FROM, WHERE YOU'RE GOING, AND WHO SPOKE TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AND THAT GOD, THAT FAITH IN KNOWING WHO YOU ARE, THAT'S THE FAITH THAT OPERATES THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; You don't need anymore. Do you hear me? [cheering] &gt;&gt; You don't need anything more. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach, friends, till you get it. &gt;&gt; We want a church of faith. &gt;&gt; WE WANT A CHURCH THAT'S NOT LIVING IN THE PAST OR WAY UP IN THE FUTURE, BUT A CHURCH THAT'S RECEIVING THINGS FROM GOD NOW. &gt;&gt; You're going to camp. YOU SAY, "OH GOD, FILL ME WITH YOUR SPIRIT, WITH A MEASURE I'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE." &gt;&gt; WE NEED IT. WE NEED IT FOR THE DAYS WE'RE LIVING IN. I CAN'T JUST GO ON the way we have. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; how about you up in the balcony? IS THIS SPEAKING TO YOUR HEART? &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; COME. Come to the fountain. Come. &gt;&gt; He has everything you need. &gt;&gt; Come. He'll transform your transform your life. I left my cliffer. Can you change that to the next? Just lead the next one on, please. But the heavens and the earth, which are now by the same word, are kept in store, &gt;&gt; reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men. &gt;&gt; Next one, please. But beloved, &gt;&gt; beloved, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; I feel that with all my heart and soul. Beloved, &gt;&gt; beloved of the Lord, &gt;&gt; called by Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; have you been called? &gt;&gt; I ask it again. Have you been called? &gt;&gt; You know that happened. That call came. &gt;&gt; You can't explain it. The little duck has a call. The prophet talked about horses. He was plowing with his father and the horses are snorting and he and he says to his dad, "What is that?" He said, "There's a storm coming. They already know it. It hasn't even arrived. There's no evidence of a storm, but the horses snorting know it." I lived in the wilderness. When I was a boy, I would hear and it was just natural. I knew that there was a wind coming because I could hear the wind and maybe 10, 15 minutes the wind would be blowing in. But they just hear it. They know it. All the birds that nest, they get away from the walls that are going to fall and go out in the middle of the field cuz earthquake's coming. All these animals, &gt;&gt; all this creation, but we're so involved. We got to be on our phone and we've got to be texting and we got to be learning and we got to be reading and we're making such plans for this life and for this and and the Holy SPIRIT IS SAYING LOOK UP. &gt;&gt; Give ear. &gt;&gt; Hear what I sent. &gt;&gt; I will send you. &gt;&gt; Do you know why we needed Elijah? because of the day that we're in. &gt;&gt; We needed SOMETHING THAT COULD SHAKE US OUT OF our &gt;&gt; out of our comfort, &gt;&gt; out of the ease. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm not predicting. I'm not making any prediction. I'm not even I'M JUST SAYING THIS COULD BE ONE thing God could use. &gt;&gt; And what I wanted to register with you this morning is that that could happen today. And this whole world, the whole world, I'll use their phrase, not mine, would unplug. &gt;&gt; THEY'D UNPLUG THE PLANET. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, my dear friends, you'd find life has changed for you &gt;&gt; drastically. And that's why we take these things serious. But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that the day that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness, but is long-suffering to us word, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. &gt;&gt; But the day of the Lord will come. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is that a promise? &gt;&gt; The day of the Lord will come. I want to say furthermore with with those of you that have had this revelation of the message, &gt;&gt; the day of the Lord has come. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I I don't know." Well, here I'll just give you a pair of binoculars. When a prophet of God actually spoke and predicted ahead of time, prophesied ahead of time that he'd meet the angels of the Lord &gt;&gt; and the seals would be open. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they came from heaven &gt;&gt; and they and the opening of the seals, he says the seals was him. Hello. Can you embrace that? &gt;&gt; The seals was him. &gt;&gt; And he took the seals off of himself. &gt;&gt; If I take the coat off of myself, &gt;&gt; I don't have it anymore. &gt;&gt; He took the seals off of himself. Who said that? He took the seals off of himself. It all ties together. Why? Because she's bride. He's bridegroom. &gt;&gt; The bride and the bridegroom go don't go into marriage with all kinds of secrets. &gt;&gt; They come they come to marriage into that most intimate estate and completely exposed. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have no more secrets. That's why it had to be that way. That's why the seals come off of him because I have no more secrets. And then the prophet says another place and he's whispering secrets to her. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE A MAN IS COMING TO BE A HUSBAND OF A WIFE IS WHISPERING HIS SECRETS TO HIS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; These are his secrets. I've covered a lot of ground this morning, &gt;&gt; but I wanted to DO THAT SO THAT THIS CONGREGATION AND THOSE YOU THOSE OF YOU GOING to camp might know. Listen friends, if even this PICTURE WHAT HAPPENED IF THAT HADN'T MISSED IT by 10 or 15 minutes, you wouldn't even be going to a camp. There wouldn't be a camp. &gt;&gt; You'd be trying to FIGURE OUT HOW TO SURVIVE. &gt;&gt; Bicycles will be at a premium. &gt;&gt; There won't be fuel for your cars. Right? &gt;&gt; The pumps won't work. &gt;&gt; Life will be changed dramatically. Is that going to happen? Is that WHAT YOU'RE PREACHING? NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M PREACHING. THAT COULD HAPPEN. THAT'S A REALITY. &gt;&gt; And the great scientists who are far greater than me are the ones that are telling us about this. &gt;&gt; They're not to startle us. They're just telling us. And that's why they didn't tell it for about two years. But God said it hundreds and hundreds of years ago. &gt;&gt; So the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night and in which the heavens shall pass away &gt;&gt; with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; Shall be burned up. &gt;&gt; And the works therein shall be burned up. IF IF YOUR LIFE IS JUST ALL CONSUMED WITH THE WORKS THEREOF, you're going to lose it all. &gt;&gt; LET US MAKE OUR HOME OUR ETERNAL WELFARE. &gt;&gt; SAY TO ALL PERSONS HERE IN THIS BUILDING, IF YOU LIVE FOR THIS LIFE, YOU LOSE. &gt;&gt; IF YOU LIVE FOR THE OTHER WORLD, you win. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hastening under the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according &gt;&gt; Hallelujah [clears throat] &gt;&gt; to his promise. &gt;&gt; Let's say that together. We according to his promise look for a new heavens &gt;&gt; and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. Oh God, I want to be done with this world. I want to be done with all of this trouble and sorrow and white fighting and violence AND WAR AND EVIL and filth and so on. &gt;&gt; And here's our promise. &gt;&gt; I give it to you &gt;&gt; according to his promise. &gt;&gt; We look for new heavens. Embrace it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hold it tight to your bosom &gt;&gt; and a new earth &gt;&gt; wherein dwelleth righteousness. I would imagine everything that has become extinct will be back in the new heaven and the new earth. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, young men that have a few years ahead of you, those years are going to go just like that. And one day when you have my gray hair, I tell you as a father, you want to be able to turn around, young ladies, you want to be able to turn around and say, "I have nothing to regret." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We work as hard as we can. We do all that we can and we we tell everybody we can. We live for Christ in the good times, in the bad times. We live for him. And he want to be able to turn around and say, "I don't regret it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Living for him. Let's all stand. &gt;&gt; Wonder Brother Ryan or could come to the piano, please. Let's bow our heads, please. Oh, Father, in the quietness and reverence of this moment, and I respect the people that have driven long distances. I see them here from Seattle, Renton, Tacoma. The people from China have flown all the way from China. I would not want to be accused of wasting their valuable time. God, what you laid on my heart and even to this morning, I pray that you will take this word, these words. &gt;&gt; I pray that you will take these things that the prophet of God spoke so clearly. I pray that you will brand our souls. Lord, may there be an imprint upon us &gt;&gt; that will be of eternal in its nature. &gt;&gt; Let us not limp along, oh God, with a watered down confession. &gt;&gt; But may it be a fervent confession. &gt;&gt; May it be AN OLDTIME CONFESSION as the early church had. I pray, oh God, you'll take the simple things that I attempted to use today and that the people will look to see what is it that I'm looking at. &gt;&gt; What is it that I see? What is it that's taking up my entire being? I pray Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, oh loving not only bridegroom but husband as you spoke in the revelation, [music] come and I'll show you the lamb's wife. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh God. Oh God, let me be one of that in that number. I pray. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we desire to be in that number. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, if there's any here that are not in that &gt;&gt; they're not in that number and they they know that it's not right yet in their heart. They have never received Jesus Christ. May they come from sinner to saint. &gt;&gt; May they be transformed, oh God, from the world to the world that is to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray, oh God, that you will work mightily in the lives of individuals. A sister's yet to be baptized, a sister desires to be prayed for. I pray, oh God, you hear us as we are in [music] prayer now. And we pray that you will come, Father, manifest and show yourself &gt;&gt; today in power today. This woman that's going to be prayed for, may she be healed, oh God, but may her sight go far beyond just healing. May her sight go on to salvation to the redeemer. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Bless the people, Lord. Oh my brother, oh my loving brother. Father Matthew, if you'd like to bring the sister, please.

She doesn't speak our language, but you speak her language. &gt;&gt; Speak to her soul, oh God. I pray you will bless our [music] visitors. &gt;&gt; I pray that you will give them, oh God, that they might hear your call. For surely you have called. Even in this service, you have called. And while I'm at this point in my prayer, I want to ask this congregation, while my eyes are closed and I'm in prayer, [music] if you have felt God dealing with you and speaking to you and you know that there's something more for you, why don't you raise your hand and say, "Here am I, Lord. Here am I. [music] Here I am, Lord. I'm here, oh God, to hear what further you have to say. And you'll speak [music] to us. You'll speak through our brother Craig Bo. You'll speak through my friends. You'll speak through your word. You'll speak through your messenger. You'll hear I will hear specific things that you want me to hear. Heavenly Father, now I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you that have come down and descended and have spoken with such a clear message. [music] Oh God, let it become a reality. Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray that a spirit of revelation may fall upon the people and that they will be openhearted and received from you, oh God, and that they might say in unison, "Lord Jesus, just lead me, direct me, direct my thoughts. Show me the path that I must take. Not the path that I've always walked in, but the path that you would have me to take at this time." [music] And father, I pray that the effect of this service will long continue beyond this this time in the name of Jesus Christ. We love you. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. We just ask you to be patient a [music] few more moments and uh we're going to baptize Sister Price. I wonder if we could just do we have a song we could just sang a [music] verse or two of a song.

Sister Precious, come on over here. Well, Sister Precious, this is what you've been desiring.
