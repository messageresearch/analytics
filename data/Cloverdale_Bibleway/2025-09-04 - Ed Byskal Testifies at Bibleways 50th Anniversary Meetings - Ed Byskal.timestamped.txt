[0:00] We've got so much to be thankful for.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats before we go any
[0:05] further.
[0:27] 50 years with a man of God.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; How thankful I am
[0:34] &gt;&gt; for that life,
[0:36] &gt;&gt; for that vision,
[0:38] &gt;&gt; and what it's produced. People have
[0:40] tried to strip it. We're still here.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Chains have been broken.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; People have been loosed.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; People have been saved.
[0:49] &gt;&gt; People have been delivered.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; We're still here, devil.
[0:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're going up.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; We're going up.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; Like to thank brother Biscll.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; 50 years of a faithful pastor.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; This is the beginning of our jubilee.
[1:07] But as I said the other day, this is not
[1:10] a day rejoicing.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; Jubilee was a year of rejoicing.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; We can start as we have started
[1:18] rejoicing in the goodness of God that
[1:20] has led us, kept us, and has kept our
[1:23] pastor.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Bisco, would you come and say
[1:26] something, please? Let's greet our dear
[1:30] pastor.
[1:40] Heat. Heat.
[2:03] We're so thankful
[2:06] for you each one and for those men that
[2:10] are here on the platform that have left
[2:12] their churches.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; Brother David Meyer
[2:17] and son Yes. have come from Switzerland.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; Uh, brother Tim Puit
[2:26] and brother Tim Puit has said
[2:31] he said again at our table
[2:34] and I believe it with all my heart. He
[2:37] said, "Brother Ron Spencer is a
[2:40] miracle."
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. when he stands and preaches
[2:45] every week. And I know something about
[2:47] that.
[2:51] And he's the man who prayed a prayer.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; When I was laying in the hospital.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; And I suddenly
[3:01] I jerked my head
[3:03] because I knew my family was waiting.
[3:07] And uh I said, "I don't know." And I
[3:12] said out loud, "I don't know if I'm
[3:14] going to come out of there."
[3:18] I had had
[3:20] brother Ron Spencer pray
[3:24] and I said, "I'll just call his cell."
[3:28] You don't mind standing, do you? No. Few
[3:31] moments.
[3:32] I'll call his cell and if he answers
[3:37] then I know that God is has put it
[3:40] together
[3:42] and I call his cell and I said, "Brother
[3:47] Ron, I called you once for prayer. Now
[3:52] I'm calling you again for prayer."
[3:56] The first time
[3:58] it was just a a physical thing, but this
[4:03] time it's a spiritual thing and I don't
[4:07] know whether I'm going to come out of
[4:09] this place
[4:12] and uh he said sure brother Ed and he
[4:16] prayed a prayer and he started to pray
[4:20] and uh I thought while he was praying I
[4:23] thought I'm going to hang on to the
[4:25] words because this is my turn.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; The woman at the well, it was her turn.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; But now this is my turn.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; And I brought it up to today.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; And friends, I'm moved.
[4:43] I'm moved because God answered the
[4:45] prayer. And I said
[4:49] I I I prayed and I said would you have
[4:54] pray
[4:56] for me? I have 14 blockages
[4:59] 90%
[5:02] in the main artery.
[5:05] I have not told all of this
[5:10] and down to 30% in other
[5:14] and my cardiologist had a look at it and
[5:17] he said to my wife
[5:20] he said
[5:22] the man that did the
[5:26] uh bypass
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; and he didn't turn on any of the bypass
[5:32] equipment. He said, "This is off pump."
[5:37] And that's what they said on the
[5:40] document.
[5:41] It was an off pump operation.
[5:45] And he operated on my heart for three
[5:48] and a half hours.
[5:50] And he Dr. Chong was his name.
[5:55] And I thought it was Dr. Watson going to
[5:58] be doing the operation.
[6:00] So I I just when brother Ron Spencer was
[6:06] praying,
[6:08] he said, "Anoint the person, anoint
[6:12] the person or the man or the woman
[6:16] &gt;&gt; or the doctor." He said, "Anoint the
[6:19] anoint them so that they will rise to
[6:24] the challenge."
[6:26] And I thought, well, I know who the
[6:29] person is. Is Dr. Watson. And I went
[6:32] back into Dr. Watson's office. Or no,
[6:36] I'm sorry. I didn't go back into his
[6:39] office. I was laying on the bed.
[6:42] And he said, "Unfortunately, we have to
[6:44] leave. I have to leave tonight and I
[6:47] will not be there to do your surgery."
[6:51] I said, "Who's going to do it?" He said,
[6:54] "Dr. Chung. he will be in charge of the
[6:58] I said Dr. Watson
[7:02] you look awfully
[7:04] awful lot like a man that stood at the
[7:08] foot of my bed who was Dr. Watson he
[7:11] said I am Dr. Watson,
[7:15] but I can't do your operation.
[7:18] And he said, we have great teams. I
[7:21] said,
[7:23] would you
[7:26] be standing there
[7:28] as I am laying here?
[7:32] Would you be as happy
[7:35] if Dr. Chong was doing
[7:39] your surgery? And the head of the team,
[7:43] he said, that was the only time he
[7:45] smiled. He cracked a little smile and he
[7:49] said, "All of our people, our teams are
[7:52] good." And I said, "Would you trust them
[7:55] with your life?"
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Yeah, I think so. I
[8:00] would." I said, "That's good
[8:06] because he's the same yesterday."
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Yep. today
[8:10] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; And there was a sister here,
[8:15] Sister Shirley,
[8:18] Brother James's wife,
[8:21] and she's up in the recording room.
[8:25] Yes. And I said to her, Sister Shirley,
[8:29] Brother James, I said to her,
[8:32] uh, I've missed you.
[8:35] I miss you from seeing your face. And
[8:38] she said, I'm up in the recording room
[8:41] and I am doing it in Chinese for the
[8:44] Chinese people. And I said, praise God.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother James.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; And and and I know that it's right. It's
[9:00] right that Shirley should be up there.
[9:06] And I know it was right. And Dr. Chung,
[9:10] he was ready to do the surgery for me.
[9:14] and he
[9:16] uh I want to say this,
[9:20] my daughters were there and they tapped
[9:24] real quick and my for my wife's sake and
[9:28] brought up the Google search and brought
[9:32] up Dr. Chung's name and he got famous by
[9:38] transplanting three human hearts in one
[9:43] evening.
[9:45] And that was a 15. He stood on his feet
[9:48] for 15 hours and transplanted those
[9:52] three hearts. And I know I felt okay.
[10:00] I felt okay. And in the morning he said,
[10:03] "Hi, I'm Dr. Chung." I said, "Nice to
[10:07] see you." He said, "This is Dr. Kang
[10:10] from Singapore. He's going to be
[10:13] assisting me and uh watching while I do
[10:17] the surgery." I said, "Well, great. I
[10:19] prayed for you all both of you and by
[10:23] name. Dr. Chung, I prayed for you. Dr.
[10:27] Kang, I prayed for you." And they said,
[10:30] "Well, thank you." They accepted that,
[10:35] but I I wanted to get that in that I had
[10:39] prayed for them.
[10:41] And a man who was a cardiologist was not
[10:44] even there, but he was looking at the
[10:47] pictures and he said, "Well," he said,
[10:50] "we have
[10:52] uh 14 blockages
[10:55] and we've bypassed those."
[10:59] And
[11:00] the Dr. Chong was able to bypass them
[11:04] with about three
[11:07] only three bypasses.
[11:10] It was just miraculous.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; And uh
[11:15] so I was standing there and he said
[11:20] he said you have this bypass and that
[11:24] bypass and you have a a an extra one. He
[11:29] says and my wife said to him, "Why do we
[11:33] have that?" He said it's because he's a
[11:36] man of God
[11:38] and he's Jewish.
[11:40] He was Jewish cardiologist,
[11:44] but he said, "Well, he's a man of God."
[11:47] And so
[11:48] they operated on it and he he he
[11:53] wouldn't let Michael in the room.
[11:57] Michael wanted so badly to go in.
[12:05] Michael's our in-house doctor,
[12:09] but he this was above him apparently.
[12:15] Anyhow, Michael, that was the other part
[12:18] of the story and that's why they
[12:21] wouldn't let because I had said to my
[12:24] wife, nobody goes in and sees until the
[12:28] tube is on them. I don't I don't want
[12:31] them to see in tube and uh that was
[12:34] because
[12:36] my grand my
[12:39] uh son-in-law
[12:42] who's married to Linda Ardal
[12:47] and Kenneth Ardal was there and I said I
[12:51] do not want them to see them moving that
[12:54] two boat two weeks before he had saw He
[12:59] had had to give the word for his mother
[13:04] to have the tube taken out and she
[13:07] didn't last and they had a funeral for
[13:12] her. And I said, I don't want that,
[13:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[13:15] &gt;&gt; I I don't want that to happen.
[13:18] I want to him to know that it's all done
[13:23] &gt;&gt; and it's finished. And the man that was
[13:26] doing it, he said, "Can you hear me?"
[13:29] "Yes." I said, "I can hear you." He
[13:32] said, "The last thing little thing I'm
[13:34] going to do is take the tube out." And I
[13:37] they took it out. I wasn't in tubed
[13:39] anymore.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; And I was perfectly fine.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; And I've been perfectly fine ever since.
[13:47] Praise God.
[13:52] Thank you, brother.
[13:57] Thank you for your prayer.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayer
[14:05] and thank God that answered it.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; And I've got here my grandson.
[14:13] Uh
[14:15] there you are, Wesley. Raise that big
[14:18] hand up. There you are. Higher, higher,
[14:21] higher, higher. There they are.
[14:26] And you give us a pleasant surprise. You
[14:29] walked into the church last night
[14:33] and you brought your daughter Naomi with
[14:36] you. Thank you for coming.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; And God bless your mom and dad
[14:43] for
[14:45] We appreciate that.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; We do.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Appreciate all the people that are here.
[14:49] Amen.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; And I have
[14:53] this was hanging in brother Cenbrer's
[14:57] office for many years
[15:01] and I had preached a sermon in Germany
[15:05] and he was there. He said that meant a
[15:08] great deal to me the prayer you prayed.
[15:14] And he said I've had it.
[15:17] And he he called his son
[15:21] uh Jonathan.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; And while Jonathan came in and saw him,
[15:27] he sent this. He said, "I have had this
[15:31] framed and I would like you to take it
[15:34] off of my wall in my office and give it
[15:37] to Brother Biscll." And while I was
[15:40] opening it, he had passed
[15:43] &gt;&gt; from this life
[15:46] to that other realm.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; And it meant a great deal to me,
[15:51] &gt;&gt; sir.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; So I wanted to show it to you and say,
[15:54] God be blessed.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; God be blessed.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Can I read the prayer to you? Amen.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[16:10] we've come to the closing moments of
[16:14] this time and we feel very connected to
[16:18] the eternal. You are our father.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; All things are within your hands
[16:28] and your
[16:30] you just deal with us so tenderly.
[16:35] You show us your will. You let us.
[16:41] We shall fulfill it all.
[16:45] You tell us we will fulfill it all. We
[16:49] shall do it, oh God. And we are so
[16:53] thankful
[16:55] &gt;&gt; you allowed us to have this time of
[17:00] eternity here in this time. and friends.

[17:21] &gt;&gt; There's Sam Reaoka.
[17:24] Just a few days ago,
[17:28] he said to God,
[17:30] "Help me.
[17:33] Help me. I need your help. By the end of
[17:37] May, isn't that right? By the end of
[17:40] May. And you had put on your zip file
[17:46] over a thousand hours
[17:49] and you needed that those details for
[17:54] the
[17:55] &gt;&gt; final paper,
[17:56] &gt;&gt; the final exam.
[18:01] And I want you people to know
[18:04] &gt;&gt; this God
[18:06] &gt;&gt; that I talk about,
[18:08] &gt;&gt; this God that I was reading about,
[18:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[18:10] &gt;&gt; This God that saw brother Coenbrunner
[18:14] lay there. And this God that said, "Take
[18:18] it off my wall and send it to Brother
[18:21] Biscll."
[18:24] And here they are. I'm showing them to

[18:38] not alive.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; That God is living.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; He's alive.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; And he's alive tonight.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; He allowed us this time
[18:51] &gt;&gt; that we're living in.

[18:56] &gt;&gt; he allowed us this but in an eternal
[19:00] realm. We are eternal beings.

[19:09] &gt;&gt; Sure do.

[19:14] &gt;&gt; And that's eternal God that sent Dr.
[19:17] Chong in to me. Yes, sir. You
[19:18] &gt;&gt; sure did. Amen.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; It's God that has had you pray your
[19:22] prayer.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; It's God that we saw you, Brother John
[19:28] Charman.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; And you were years a deacon
[19:33] &gt;&gt; in the log church. We saw you peeling
[19:37] the logs.

[19:43] &gt;&gt; yes,
[19:44] &gt;&gt; saw you doing it in eternity. Amen.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; And here are a number of people that
[19:51] have been saved.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Filled with the Holy Spirit,
[19:57] &gt;&gt; guided by the spirit of almighty God
[20:01] &gt;&gt; in this time.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; They're living here as living
[20:06] testimonies
[20:08] &gt;&gt; of the grace of God.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; I say praise be to God.

[20:35] &gt;&gt; God bless
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Sister Shirley that is up in the
[20:40] &gt;&gt; in the
[20:42] translation booth.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Translation cubicle.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah, she's right there
[20:47] &gt;&gt; in the eagle's nest.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Shirley.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; This is a living Christ,
[20:56] &gt;&gt; a living reality.
[20:57] [Music]
[20:59] &gt;&gt; And thank you.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Tom.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Dad.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[21:06] God bless you.
[21:12] You should tell the rest of
[21:14] Brother Sam.
[21:17] Brother Sam, you took your dog for a
[21:19] walk.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; The night before you were to have that
[21:23] exam
[21:26] and the dog stopped and went into the
[21:29] bushes, didn't it?
[21:32] And he started scratching in the bush
[21:35] and pretty soon he had the zip the zip
[21:39] file in his mouth.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; And you took it out of that was after
[21:44] rain, after freezing.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; After snowfall.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Nothing could change that.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; And you plugged it in and it worked
[21:54] perfect.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; God be blessed.
[21:59] Hallelujah.
[22:05] Glory.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Is he the same yesterday, today, and
[22:10] forever?
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Is he alive?
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Well, if you think we're having a normal
[22:28] service, you came to the wrong church.
[22:33] We don't have regular services anymore.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Can the church of the living God say
[22:39] amen?
[22:40] &gt;&gt; We have a few visitors that might be
[22:42] timeconscious, but we've changed that.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; I should say the Holy Spirit changed
[22:47] that.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; And so, we're going to have a jubilee
[22:50] whether the devil likes it or not.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; We don't have a time zone.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; We got nowhere else to go.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; We want to give God the glory this
[22:58] weekend.
[23:03] Amen. But I we'll give some brother
[23:05] David obviously all the time he wants.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; You see these banners that we have up
[23:12] here. Those banners were printed and
[23:15] they were put up over the sound uh um
[23:18] battens. You can see it. You read it
[23:21] vertically, not across horizontally. Did
[23:24] you get that? Because if you go that
[23:26] way, you'll be confused as I was.
[23:29] And I heard as it were a voice of great
[23:32] multitude
[23:34] &gt;&gt; and as the voice of many waters and a
[23:37] voice of mighty thunderings
[23:40] &gt;&gt; saying hallelujah.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; So don't get scared when we say
[23:43] hallelujah.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; All heaven is saying hallelujah.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; For the Lord God omnipotent.
[23:52] You get that word omnipotent. That means
[23:55] our God can do anything and he has done
[23:58] everything and he wants to do more this
[24:00] weekend.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; He's the Lord God omnipotent and he
[24:04] reigns tonight.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; It goes on to the next verse. Let us be
[24:09] sad.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; No,
[24:12] &gt;&gt; what does it say?
[24:14] Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[24:16] honor to him.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; For the marriage of the lamb is come
[24:21] &gt;&gt; and his wife
[24:23] &gt;&gt; has made herself ready.
[24:32] That's your verse this weekend. That's
[24:35] our verse this jubilee time. And we want
[24:39] to thank God that he's so gracious to in
[24:44] interrupt
[24:47] the devil.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Try to take our pastor.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; And I remember dad that you said,
[24:56] "Would you do this?"
[24:59] He said, "Do you want to see another
[25:01] Christmas?"
[25:03] That was pretty that's pretty profound.
[25:05] And of course we said we want to see him
[25:07] to see another Christmas. And God has
[25:09] given him another Christmas and another
[25:11] Christmas and another Christmas.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? So we can be here rejoicing
[25:18] with his sheep.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Did you get that? His sheep.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; And here we are rejoicing with you, Dad.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; You've been a great shepherd
[25:27] &gt;&gt; and we love you.
[25:30] [Applause]
[25:38] We had a wonderful evening last night
[25:42] and I want to thank all those that have
[25:43] made this church and and brought it up
[25:46] and made what it is today and we had a
[25:49] lovely evening and we're thankful for
[25:52] everyone and everybody says don't say my
[25:54] name and don't say my name so I'm not
[25:56] saying any name I just want to thank the
[25:59] body of Christ here that has made this
[26:02] available for us this weekend to look as
[26:04] lovely as the church looks after all
[26:07] these years. God bless you. So, we're in
[26:11] a celebration.
[26:12] We're in a jubilee.
[26:14] We are thankful for the lives that God
[26:16] has given us in Christ Jesus. We are
[26:19] thankful for everything that he does
[26:21] within the body of Christ. We're
[26:24] thankful for men of God that have come
[26:26] to join with us. We have tonight,
[26:29] Brother David Mayor from Switzerland,
[26:31] France, Belgium, the bride. He's from
[26:36] heaven actually.
[26:38] And brother David has been a big part of
[26:42] going forward within the church. And
[26:45] over these last 10, 12 years, brother
[26:48] David has hosted had the vision with
[26:50] brother Biscll to have meetings for
[26:52] Europe, Africa, the collective uh around
[26:56] the world come to the meetings. And
[26:57] we're privileged to have you tonight,
[26:59] Brother David, as our our first speaker.
[27:02] We want to thank you for coming,
[27:04] sacrificing your family time, and your

[27:10] [Applause]
[27:14] &gt;&gt; brother Timothy Puit. Brother Timothy,
[27:16] know I know we're short, right? So, this
[27:19] is not a short joke. So, would you
[27:21] please stand?
[27:24] Brother Timothy
[27:26] has been a young man that we've admired
[27:28] over the years. God has raised up for
[27:32] the bride of Jesus Christ. You have
[27:34] blessed our young people. Brother Bram
[27:36] said, "If you want to bless me, bless my
[27:39] children."
[27:40] &gt;&gt; And you've blessed us deeply.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; And Brother Timothy will be speaking
[27:45] tomorrow morning. And we want to all be
[27:47] here pulling on the man of God. Thank
[27:50] you for coming, Brother Timothy.
[27:57] [Applause]
[27:59] Well, here are my two heroes in here.
[28:03] Brother Ron, God bless you. You've been
[28:06] a friend, a man of God, a mentor, a
[28:09] brother, a buddy, as they say, and we
[28:13] thank you from the depths of our heart.
[28:16] You've always said, "Well, Brother Ed's
[28:18] been a hero to me." I want you to know
[28:20] you've been a hero to us. God bless you,
[28:22] brother.
[28:26] [Applause]
[28:34] And brother Tim, I don't have enough
[28:36] words to thank you for your life in
[28:39] Christ
[28:41] &gt;&gt; and what you've meant to this church.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; You have stood when many ran.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget that.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Never.
[28:50] Never.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; That's a man of God. And we thank God. I
[28:59] can't say enough, but I want to thank
[29:01] God for your life, Brother Timothy, for
[29:03] your family, your church, and all that
[29:06] you've done for the bride of Jesus
[29:07] Christ.
[29:08] [Applause]
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Saturday night, Brother Ron will be
[29:20] speaking. Lord willing, we'll have a
[29:21] prayer line if that would be the way
[29:23] that the Lord leads. And then of course
[29:26] Sunday morning, Brother Tim will be
[29:28] speaking at 10:00. 4:00 will be a
[29:31] banquet and that is for you.
[29:34] We love you.
[29:38] We're doing this because you've meant so
[29:40] much to us. We'd like to give something
[29:43] back to you. The trustees have sat down.
[29:46] God bless our trustees, our deacons, and
[29:50] all that they do. They're behind the
[29:51] scene men of God and we're thankful for
[29:53] every one of them. And so we will have a
[29:56] banquet. They they will be serving at
[29:59] 4:00 and dinners at 5. And everyone that
[30:01] has signed up, of course, is is welcome.
[30:05] We have different ones here. Brother
[30:06] Steven Dodd has made it all the way from
[30:08] Grand Prairie, Alberta. Minister, we
[30:10] thank you, brother Steven, for making
[30:12] the effort to come with your sons. We
[30:15] thank God for all those that have flown
[30:16] in. We've got nine people flying in at
[30:20] two in the o'lock this morning yet to
[30:22] come. People are coming and we're
[30:24] thankful for them. So you look around
[30:27] the room and we hear of course of
[30:28] brother Dodd and and what he's done in
[30:31] Uganda and doing and brother Timothy has
[30:33] been a a great part of this and brother
[30:36] Timothy I know you don't like this but
[30:39] please could you please stand because we
[30:41] couldn't do whatever we've done without
[30:44] your support and vision.
[30:50] Happy birthday.
[30:51] [Applause]
[30:59] Thank you. Thank you for your
[31:01] friendship. Thank you for your love. Are
[31:04] we're Are we're going to enjoy
[31:06] ourselves?
[31:07] &gt;&gt; We're going to enjoy. We're going to
[31:09] sing that chorus we've been singing and
[31:11] I'm going to invite Brother David Mayor
[31:13] to come and and minister to us. goodness
[31:16] has followed us. Can we say that as
[31:19] assembly?
[31:20] &gt;&gt; It's been a sort of a song we've been
[31:22] singing in the last little while, but I
[31:24] preached on it years ago. And
[31:27] and that goodness that will pursue you.
[31:30] It'll overtake you. It will keep you.
[31:34] And here we are tonight, kept by the
[31:36] power, the blood of Jesus Christ, we can
[31:39] say, "Surely the goodness of God
[31:42] comes after us." Let's stand as we
[31:44] welcome brother David Mayor to minister
[31:48] tonight.
[31:57] [Music]
[32:00] All my days
[32:03] I held in your hands.
[32:06] [Music]
[32:08] From the moment I wake up
[32:13] till I lay my head.
[32:16] Oh, I will sing
[32:19] of the goodness
[32:22] of God.
[32:26] [Music]
[32:27] And all my life you have been faithful.
[32:34] [Music]
[32:36] Oh my
[32:40] so
[32:44] every
[32:50] sing
[32:52] of the goodness
[32:54] of God
[32:57] my life
[32:59] and all my life you have been faithful.
[33:04] Oh,
[33:10] so
[33:16] every
[33:22] single
[33:24] goodness
[33:26] of God.
[33:29] Hallelujah. Can we give him half of
[33:32] praise? Thank you, Jesus.
[33:36] Hallelujah.
[33:38] Amen. Amen. God bless you, saints. What
[33:42] an honor to be standing here. That's
[33:44] from the bottom of my heart. It's good
[33:47] to be back, but it's an honor to be
[33:49] standing here in front of the saints for
[33:52] this 50th anniversary.
[33:56] My I just want to take a before I
[33:59] preach. This is the moment I want to
[34:01] take. So maybe if you can take your
[34:03] seats just a
[34:06] so I bring you greetings on behalf of my
[34:08] precious wife, family, the church and I
[34:12] have my son with me. I'm very happy he
[34:14] could join. When I asked him do you want
[34:17] to come? Oh for the meetings I want to
[34:18] come. So he made it possible. So but
[34:21] again I repeat it's an honor to be
[34:23] standing here.
[34:25] many would have loved to be here. So I
[34:28] thank brother Ed, brother Tom for the
[34:30] invitation
[34:32] and we want to give honor where honor is
[34:35] due. So I want to take my time
[34:38] and
[34:42] we have all the generals behind. So
[34:47] it's really an honor and a blessing.
[34:50] But when God calls a man, he calls his
[34:53] wife.
[34:55] So, Brother Ed, Sister Ruth,
[34:59] I looked up the word legacy. What a
[35:02] legacy.
[35:04] It says a gift or something transmitted.
[35:09] Now, 50 years is well, if if youngsters
[35:14] and you know, teenagers, you tell them
[35:16] you're 50, you're old.
[35:19] I know what I'm talking about. So
[35:22] but 50 years in a church many things
[35:25] happen. We we could see the pictures log
[35:28] church how it how God blessed
[35:33] &gt;&gt; because that's been said but I want to
[35:35] said because a man of God had a vision.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe you were not there but when you
[35:41] look around
[35:43] that's God's doing
[35:46] &gt;&gt; and it is marvelous.
[35:48] It is marvelous.
[35:52] Brother Ed has given all he had for the
[35:57] wonderful world of God.
[35:59] And when I said he has, it ain't over
[36:02] yet. Because if he wants to give advice
[36:05] even now, he will say spread the
[36:08] message, spread the word, give it out
[36:10] wherever. Right? And when I said it's an
[36:14] honor to be standing here as you can
[36:15] look around and please do
[36:19] you know your brothers and sisters but
[36:21] there's an unseen
[36:23] huge crowd
[36:26] maybe we don't think about but that were
[36:29] touched because they received one
[36:32] message book
[36:34] &gt;&gt; because a man of God had a passion a
[36:37] zeal.
[36:40] So yeah, we want to give honor where
[36:41] honor is due.
[36:43] I met brother I heard brother Ed years
[36:47] years and years ago and but for the
[36:49] first time we met brother Ed in Germany.
[36:53] That was the first time we met at
[36:54] brother G Roaltz
[36:56] in Beaslesburg and there was a direct
[36:59] bond a direct connection a direct love
[37:02] if I may say. So don't be jealous.
[37:05] Please, because some people could be
[37:07] jealous, but don't be jealous.
[37:11] You cannot manufacture that.
[37:17] And through the years, I've spent time
[37:20] with brother Ed. I've been honored to
[37:21] have him in my home and listening to
[37:24] advice and and and
[37:27] what a blessing. You are blessed. We are
[37:30] blessed.
[37:32] And then I learned and that understands
[37:34] even better the connection is of course
[37:37] we love the word.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; We do everything we have for the word of
[37:41] God. And then also hearing his life
[37:44] story or you know when brother Ed was
[37:47] born he was in the Anna Turnbull
[37:50] Memorial Hospital in Saskatchewan. I'm
[37:53] sorry my pronunciation
[37:55] but what struck me is that since 1908
[37:58] there was a Dr. RG Scott that was from
[38:01] the Geneva mission who was in charge.
[38:05] So, Brother Red, there was a connection
[38:07] already. You were born.
[38:11] But even before we were born, there was
[38:14] already a connection.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; We were together before the foundation
[38:17] of the world.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; And we are feasting sir
[38:22] &gt;&gt; on what God has done through a vessel, a
[38:25] surrendered vessel. 50 years many things
[38:28] happens. Many joys,
[38:31] many hardships,
[38:34] many births,
[38:36] baptisms.
[38:37] Some people has left us.
[38:40] But I thank God for brother Ed, sister
[38:43] Ruth.
[38:45] You know brother Ram, he speaks about
[38:47] great woman. He says is a woman who has
[38:50] faith.
[38:52] That's sister Ruth.
[38:55] Amen.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; And greatness says brother Brandham is
[39:00] humility.
[39:02] Thank you brother Ed. He would never
[39:05] take credit for what he has done for the
[39:07] message.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; If you want to speak that's why I want
[39:11] to take this opportunity. Please forgive
[39:12] me brother Ed. But from the bottom of my
[39:16] heart I would like to say thank you. And
[39:19] when I say there's an unseen invisible
[39:21] crowd. Yes. When brother Ed came over to
[39:24] the meetings,
[39:27] you have people from different countries
[39:29] coming and say, "Thank you for sending
[39:32] us the message. Thank you for
[39:34] translating."
[39:36] Maybe you don't understand that
[39:40] because you speak English. You got all
[39:42] the message books. You got all the tapes
[39:44] in audio. But out there, there are
[39:47] people
[39:48] that live with one message book for
[39:52] months and months and months.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; So I thank God for a vision that he gave
[39:59] to a man. We're not lifting up man. But
[40:01] yes, we want to be thankful to God for
[40:04] what he has done for us.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Ed never wants to take credit.
[40:10] But I want to say thank you, brother Ed.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; I love you from the bottom of my heart.
[40:15] We love you. Family loves you. The
[40:17] church loves you. The saints love you.
[40:21] And while I was coming here,
[40:25] I listened to a tape on the plane and
[40:28] randomly
[40:30] and it was proving his word and brother
[40:33] Brennham starts talking and he says,
[40:36] "Well, there's my precious friend of
[40:39] mine, brother Reverend Eddie Biscll."
[40:41] Said, "Well, hallelujah." No, God knows
[40:43] how to do things.
[40:46] There, brother, my reverend, good
[40:48] friend, brother, Reverend Eddie Biscll,
[40:50] wife and children.
[40:52] And he says, probably he was looking for
[40:55] brother Eddie.
[40:57] Now, that's not the amen corner.
[41:01] He says, "You can come over here on the
[41:03] platform. You're welcome to come up."
[41:06] And then he continues to give the
[41:08] testimony about the Green Checker Church
[41:10] and so on. So, I'm glad
[41:13] &gt;&gt; the prophet called him a good friend.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; By God's grace,
[41:19] &gt;&gt; I can call brother Ed Biscll
[41:22] a friend of mine.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; It is an honor
[41:25] &gt;&gt; to be standing with real man of God.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; So, may God bless him. May God bless
[41:32] Sister Ruth.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:38] And like the prophet would say, brother
[41:41] Rad, Sister Ruth, a huge portion of
[41:43] heaven
[41:44] &gt;&gt; awaits thee.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; What you have done to the least.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; You have done it unto me.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Eden.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:58] And thank you. Thank you.
[42:06] So it ain't over.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; It's just a continuation
[42:13] because something has been transmitted,
[42:15] a passion, a zeal, and we will continue
[42:19] until we leave this place. Amen. Why
[42:22] don't we stand?
[42:25] Hallelujah.
[42:34] We can take the word of God,
[42:37] take Leviticus,
[42:43] and please forgive me if I didn't shake
[42:45] your hand yesterday night.
[42:48] So, we'll have the whole weekend to
[42:49] shake hands. So,
[42:52] wanted to get ready for today, but
[42:55] I believe God will bless us tonight and
[42:58] through the whole weekend. So, Leviticus
[43:01] 25:8.
[43:14] And thou shalt number seven Sabbaths of
[43:16] years unto thee seven times seven years,
[43:18] and the space of seven Sabbaths of years
[43:21] shall be unto thee 40 and nine years.
[43:23] Then shall I cause the trumpet of the
[43:26] Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the
[43:28] seventh month. So we see here Revelation
[43:31] 10:7. Okay, please read just putting
[43:35] some foundations here. In the day of
[43:37] atonement shall you make the trumpet
[43:39] sound throughout all your land.
[43:42] And you shall hold the 50th year and
[43:44] proclaim liberty throughout all the land
[43:46] unto all the inhabitants thereof. It
[43:49] shall be a jubilee unto you. And ye
[43:52] shall return every man unto his
[43:54] possession, and ye shall return every
[43:56] man unto his family. A jubilee shall be
[43:58] the 50th year be unto you. Ye shall not
[44:00] sow, neither reap that which groweth of
[44:03] itself in it, nor gather the grapes in
[44:06] it of thy vine undressed, for it is the
[44:08] jubilee. It shall be holy unto you. Ye
[44:11] shall eat the increase thereof out of
[44:13] the field, and in the year of this
[44:15] jubilee, ye shall return every man unto
[44:19] his possession.
[44:20] Amen.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:23] Another scripture in John 8
[44:27] verse 31.
[44:45] Then Jesus
[44:47] then said Jesus to those Jews which
[44:49] believed on him, "If you continue in my
[44:51] word, then are ye my disciples indeed,
[44:55] and ye shall know the truth, and the
[44:57] truth shall make you free."
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; They answered him, "We be Abraham's
[45:02] seed, and we were never in bondage to
[45:04] any man. How sayest thou, ye shall be
[45:06] made free?" Jesus answered them,
[45:08] "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[45:10] whosoever committeth sin is the servant
[45:12] of sin. And the servant abideth not in
[45:15] the house forever, but the son abideth
[45:17] ever. If the son therefore shall make
[45:20] you free,
[45:22] ye shall be partially free, you shall be
[45:26] 99.9.
[45:27] No, ye shall be free indeed.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May God add the blessing to
[45:35] the reading of his word. Let's pray.
[45:37] Precious heavenly father. Lord, once
[45:40] again, we want to give you all the
[45:42] glory, Father. How thankful we are,
[45:45] Father, for the church here, Lord, for
[45:47] the celebration of 50 years, Lord God.
[45:50] And how we thank you for all the work
[45:53] that's been done, Lord. All those that
[45:55] have labored for this weekend. I pray
[45:57] may you give them a special blessing,
[45:59] Lord. May you bless Brother Ed, Sister
[46:01] Ruth, Father. Lord, may you watch over
[46:03] them, Lord. and how thankful we are,
[46:05] Father, to have been standing together
[46:07] here on the battlefield, Lord. And
[46:10] Father, for the blessing, Lord, through
[46:12] the vessel, Lord. So, may you bless them
[46:15] especially in this weekend. Bless each
[46:17] and everyone here, Father, those that
[46:18] are streaming, Lord. And Father, we can
[46:21] read your word, Lord. Anybody can read
[46:23] the word, but Father, we ask you, the
[46:25] author, to come down, Father, and to
[46:28] break the bread of life, Lord, to oh,
[46:30] Lord, make yourself real to each and
[46:32] everyone, Father. May may it not be just
[46:35] an anniversary for of a church Lord but
[46:37] may each and everyone receive his
[46:39] liberty his freedom Lord that you have
[46:42] given us Father. So may you take full
[46:44] control father I surrender Lord and may
[46:46] you speak through the vessel. We pray
[46:48] and ask these things in Jesus Christ's
[46:50] name. Amen and amen. God bless you. You
[46:54] may be seated.
[46:57] Amen. For a title tonight.
[47:02] I was listening to this song and said,
[47:04] "Oh, they're they're taking my sermon
[47:08] for a title,
[47:10] the bride's jubilee is a reality."
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We sung the song, my jubilee. So,
[47:18] it's something personal. My jubilee.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. There, where the spirit of the
[47:23] Lord is, there's liberty. Amen. So, our
[47:26] worship is not to bring us back to Isuza
[47:28] Street or No, no. It's not just an
[47:30] emotion or an excitement. No, but it's
[47:33] it's the word of God, the opening of the
[47:35] word that produces that
[47:39] &gt;&gt; the dynamics on the mechanics. But how
[47:42] thankful we are. Amen. For the true
[47:44] jubilee. If we look up in the in the
[47:46] lexicon in Hebrew, it says yobel means
[47:49] trumpet. The Greek lexican uh says
[47:52] release from bondage forgiveness or
[47:55] pardon letting them go as if they had
[47:58] never been committed.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So therefore I'm going to put
[48:03] bring a parallel now. We read Amen. 10:7
[48:06] Revelation 10:7. Amen. And and God is so
[48:10] good because the prophet could say it's
[48:13] like you've never done in the first
[48:14] place.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. The definition of jubilee, amen,
[48:19] is a season or occasion of joyful
[48:22] celebration. So I don't want to see any
[48:25] sad face. This is an opening service,
[48:27] but it's not an opening service. Amen.
[48:29] It's a continuation. Amen. It's a book
[48:32] of acts that is being written. So it's
[48:34] from glory to glory and glory to glory.
[48:38] If you don't want it, I will take it.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. 50 years is gold. Yeah,
[48:46] &gt;&gt; this is a golden time in the world. They
[48:48] speak it's it's a horrible time. This is
[48:50] a golden time for us for the bride.
[48:53] Amen. Brother Brandham says 50 means
[48:55] jubilee. 50 is God's jubilee number. The
[48:59] word Pentecost means 50. So let it be
[49:02] another Pentecost this after this
[49:04] weekend.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Jubilee means the going up, the release.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the jubilee I want. That's
[49:13] the jubilee I want. Amen. We can look
[49:16] into Sabbath. The Sabbath means a rest.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then brother Bram says the Holy
[49:22] Spirit is a Sabbath.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we going to we going to just
[49:26] Amen. travel along through the
[49:28] scriptures if that is okay.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And for the Americans, I I did
[49:33] some research for the our dear friends
[49:35] from the United States who crossed the
[49:37] border.
[49:39] I will have a big amen on that one.
[49:42] We'll see there.
[49:44] Yeah. The Liberty Bell
[49:49] was a symbol of the American
[49:52] independence.
[49:54] The first time it was rang was on July
[49:57] the 8th, 1776.
[50:00] And it was to summon the people to hear
[50:02] the Declaration of Independence. And on
[50:04] that bell was written a part of
[50:07] Leviticus 25:10. It says, "Proclaim
[50:10] liberty throughout all the land unto all
[50:13] the inhabitants thereof." So, a country
[50:17] can proclaim liberty and people rejoice
[50:21] about it. People, oh, they'll have a big
[50:23] party because we are free. I mean, we
[50:25] can hear wars, rumors of wars, and and
[50:28] and we're sad and we pray for our
[50:30] beloved ones there and the saints there.
[50:32] And when a people is in oppression, yes,
[50:35] people live under fear and all this. But
[50:39] then when the liberty is proclaimed,
[50:41] it's a time of great celebration. Amen.
[50:44] But I'm not here to ring the liberty
[50:46] bell of the United States. I'm here to
[50:48] proclaim the liberty that God has given
[50:51] us. Amen. And we going to we're going to
[50:54] ring that bell so loud through the
[50:56] weekend. Amen. That each and everyone
[50:59] can receive the liberty.
[51:04] Hallelujah.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; So my liberty.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Make it personal.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; We know brother Brandman speaks about
[51:14] seven Sabbaths which is the seven church
[51:17] ages. Now the Jews they have been
[51:19] blinded and they waiting all this time
[51:21] while the Pentecostal first fruits has
[51:24] been poured out upon the church. Amen.
[51:27] So through the ages. Amen. The
[51:29] Pentecost, the first fruits have been
[51:31] poured out.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; And here we are.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Here we are. My what a celebration.
[51:37] Amen. In return and jubilee, brother
[51:40] Brandham says as a type, we're going to
[51:42] use Israel because Amen. It's the
[51:46] Jubilee time. And the church was given a
[51:48] portion which was who? Christ himself
[51:53] that was poured out by the Holy Spirit
[51:56] into each heart that would receive it
[51:59] &gt;&gt; and then become sons of God.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Listen now.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; We're building up now. Israel was a
[52:07] servant to God and was given a
[52:09] possession.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[52:13] And this possession
[52:15] was not given to anyone else.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that.
[52:21] So when Satan comes around, he tries to
[52:24] steal your blessing, tries to steal your
[52:26] possession,
[52:29] &gt;&gt; the Jubilee trumpet sounds,
[52:33] &gt;&gt; and when I hear the word of God, I can
[52:35] claim my God-given rights.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory, glory.
[52:42] If someone
[52:44] &gt;&gt; or an individual lost their inheritance
[52:47] that was given to them by God.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; So it's not any inheritance that God g.
[52:54] It's given by God.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; It's about time we wake up.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; The awakening of the bride is a reality.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; The bride's jubilee is a reality. Not an
[53:08] emotion, not something manufactured.
[53:10] It's a reality.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Glory. So if any individual lost their
[53:18] inheritant given by God,
[53:21] &gt;&gt; there came a year called the Jubilee
[53:23] year.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; And every seven years there was a
[53:26] Sabbath. and this jubilee. Every man
[53:29] that had lost his inheritance, every man
[53:35] &gt;&gt; I'm looking to
[53:39] &gt;&gt; by some means if he was a freeborn.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Huh? Brother Brandham says we are not
[53:50] born to be in bondage to be slaves. We
[53:54] are born to be sons and daughters of
[53:57] God.
[53:58] [Music]
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Freeborn and trueblooded Israelites.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham would say, "I'm not
[54:09] born Charles Alabra and a Brennham.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; I come from God. I go back to God."
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[54:20] So no matter who held the possession, he
[54:24] it had to go back to him free. He didn't
[54:27] have to pay anything. He didn't have to
[54:30] do a thing, but just stop what he was
[54:33] doing and go back to his inheritance. It
[54:36] was a God-given right because by grace
[54:40] he inherited it. Amen.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; So no matter what had taken place, So no
[54:47] matter what has taken place before you
[54:49] arrive here,
[54:52] &gt;&gt; if he lost it, it must go free because
[54:56] it meant grace is a way provided for
[54:58] each individual
[55:01] &gt;&gt; to return to their rightful inheritance.
[55:05] My the Jubilee is God's manner of
[55:09] expressing grace to his people.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; For restoring or be or be brought back
[55:19] to their rightful position.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Our rightful position in Jesus Christ.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Now I believe that this is the hour
[55:32] again of Jubilee. I believe it's the
[55:35] time of Jubilee, says a prophet.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Now, a man and his family could go back
[55:44] to their original inheritance.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; If they could hear the Jubilee,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; now we know Revelation speaks about he
[55:52] that had an ear, let him hear what the
[55:55] spirit says unto the churches.
[55:58] Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; So Lord, let my spiritual ear be so
[56:03] sensitive
[56:04] &gt;&gt; when the word comes forward. I don't
[56:06] want to be busy with all kinds or going
[56:08] around with all my mind battles, all
[56:10] kinds of thoughts. I want to receive. If
[56:13] only a word I know my life can be
[56:16] changed.
[56:18] [Music]
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[56:24] So he if he could hear the jubilee a
[56:26] trumpet sound and know what it meant to
[56:29] them. The priest brother Brown calls it
[56:32] the Jubilee priest.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; The Jubilee priest
[56:36] &gt;&gt; that sound the trumpet meeting service
[56:38] after service. Service after service.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Jubilee priest sound the
[56:45] trumpet. The minister. The trumpet is a
[56:47] gospel. So no matter where they lost,
[56:50] how far they went back.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen now. How far you went
[56:55] back doesn't matter.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Whatever they had to do, they had the
[57:00] privilege.
[57:02] We have the privilege tonight to be in
[57:06] the presence of God Almighty.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; To come and receive again their
[57:13] inheritance.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Come on, mom and dad. Listen to this.
[57:17] the whole family could come and receive
[57:21] their inheritance.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; You have a wayward son, a wayward
[57:28] daughter, it doesn't matter. It's your
[57:30] inheritance. It's your possession.
[57:34] [Applause]
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:42] Or
[57:43] &gt;&gt; there's the other crowd that have walled
[57:46] themselves so far that they want to
[57:49] listen to what somebody says about it
[57:56] instead of listening to thus sayeth the
[57:59] Lord.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; You know, I rather listen to somebody
[58:03] who might have a clearer understanding.
[58:06] I might listen to somebody who got a
[58:09] revelation or some kind of doctrine or
[58:11] whatever. Nonsense. Give me the pure
[58:14] word. God sent me a vindicated prophet.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; For who? For me
[58:22] &gt;&gt; for my jubilee.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Thine of glory. Now is the hour of
[58:31] jubilee.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. Now is the hour of jubilee.
[58:37] Come on, church. Don't put it on
[58:40] tomorrow. Tomorrow we'll have another
[58:42] jubilee. Now is the hour of jubilee.
[58:45] [Applause]
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Come back to your original inheritance,
[58:56] to a real Holy Ghost again.
[59:02] And outside of the pure word, you won't
[59:05] have a real Holy Ghost. You can have
[59:08] sensation. You can have emotions. You
[59:10] can have all kinds of goosebumps or hair
[59:13] coming like this and all kinds of
[59:14] things.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; But it's not a true real baptism of the
[59:19] Holy Ghost.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Now, you could go free. Didn't have to
[59:26] pay anything. Didn't have to do nothing.
[59:28] Just get up and go. That's all he had to
[59:30] do. Amen. If he knew the sound of the
[59:34] trumpet, but he had to know the sound of
[59:37] the trumpet,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; for they were sons of God.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Now, you know, a trumpet can sound many
[59:47] ways.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; In the army, a trumpet can sound and
[59:51] it's one sound to call you, let's come
[59:53] and dine. Another sound just to wake you
[59:57] up.
[1:00:01] or another sound for the raising of the
[1:00:04] flag.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; But the Jubilee trumpet had a sound,
[1:00:10] a clear sound, not an uncertain sound.
[1:00:14] It was a sound from God himself.
[1:00:19] And the people knew when I hear that
[1:00:22] sound,
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; the seed in me knows when I hear that
[1:00:26] sound, no matter where I'm at, I hear
[1:00:29] the sound, I can go free. I be I can be
[1:00:35] delivered. I can be healed.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; My
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; But it's individual.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; It's your jubilee.
[1:00:49] Let's come back to to Israel. Moses
[1:00:52] receives the promise. Go deliver my
[1:00:54] people.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; They go out.
[1:01:01] Now they're front of this nice country.
[1:01:04] Moses couldn't go. There's Joshua and
[1:01:06] Caleb.
[1:01:09] The land where it's flowing of milk and
[1:01:11] honey.
[1:01:12] Brother says, "You've been on this
[1:01:14] mountain long enough, but come on."
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:17] Let's go over.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Let's possess our inheritance.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; It's time to rise to be sons of God in
[1:01:26] the name of Jesus Christ and rise to a
[1:01:29] place so you can return in this jubilee
[1:01:32] and hear the sound of the trumpet of the
[1:01:35] gospel of the word of God.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; You are brethren, not a denomination.
[1:01:43] You are born sons and daughters of God.
[1:01:46] But if the slave wants to stay a slave,
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; let him be. Let him stay in these walled
[1:01:54] cities.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; But you are free.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; "Let's go back to our inheritance. Let's
[1:02:03] go back to the beginning.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to what we were from the
[1:02:08] beginning."
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; An attribute of God. We come from God.
[1:02:13] We go back to him. Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Now, Joshua,
[1:02:21] he didn't have the poor me attitude.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't have the grasshopper attitude.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't have the defeat attitude.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; I'm making it personal now.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; How do we come to church?
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, poor me.
[1:02:45] No, not poor me.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Joshua said, "We're more than able."
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; You think Joshua didn't have eyes?
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, he did. He even knew very well
[1:02:56] how thick the walls were.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; God always does. Like brother Joe would
[1:03:02] say, incredible math.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; So, here we have Joshua. How can I
[1:03:10] destroy the walls?
[1:03:13] The land is ours. The promise is ours.
[1:03:16] God gave it to us. But how can I possess
[1:03:19] the land? There has to be a way that
[1:03:22] these walls, these seals can open.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; If those seals don't open, I won't see
[1:03:31] my full possession. I won't see my true
[1:03:34] identity. I won't see my full
[1:03:36] inheritance.
[1:03:41] So what does he do?
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; We never pray enough. So he goes, that's
[1:03:46] biblical, huh?
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; He goes to prayer.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; And here he meets someone,
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord. He has his sword
[1:03:54] drawn.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Are you for me or against me?
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; I'm the captain here.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; I'm the captain here and I'm in charge
[1:04:04] of this.
[1:04:06] Say Joshua, you're going to follow me.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; I'm leading this battle.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Our Lord is mighty in battle.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even brother Brham himself needed
[1:04:23] the angel to come down.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; He says it himself for those that want
[1:04:30] to make from brother Brandham a god. And
[1:04:32] with all due respect, but he isn't God.
[1:04:36] He said, "If the angel wouldn't have
[1:04:37] come, I would have told you a terrible
[1:04:40] mistake."
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; So, no one is worthy to take the book,
[1:04:48] to open the seals thereof. Only the lamb
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; slain before the foundation of the world
[1:04:55] is worthy to take the book and to open
[1:04:58] the seals thereof.
[1:05:00] So no man can claim
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; my revelation.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; God keeps that to himself.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; So this is not a revelation of brother
[1:05:14] Brham.
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; This is not brother Brham's property
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; or anybody's property.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; This is God's property.
[1:05:33] Some people don't like it, but it's the
[1:05:34] truth anyway.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; I'll be gone in a few days. So,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; the word is God's property.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And he reveals his own word.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; So, God himself chose his bride.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Just like I explained, there's a
[1:05:55] connection. Love, appreciation, respect.
[1:05:59] I mean, that's what God, he chose his
[1:06:03] bride.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; It's not a person. It's not a group.
[1:06:07] It's not a headquarters.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; It's God himself.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; So now during those seven church ages,
[1:06:13] they have been walking in silence around
[1:06:15] the walls. And here comes the seven
[1:06:18] church age. And it says, "But in the
[1:06:21] days of the voice,
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; when he will begin to sound,
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; the mystery of God shall be finished,
[1:06:29] shall be revealed, shall be made clear.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Christ revealed."
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It shall be finished. These walls,
[1:06:37] these seals shall be opened.
[1:06:42] These thunders will utter their voices.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; And you will have a jubilee.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Not a man-made jubilee. Not from a man
[1:06:55] somewhere in a country or son. No, a
[1:06:58] real jubilee from God himself.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] For some there's still silence. H but
[1:07:12] for the bride the silence is broken.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; For the bride it is a rejoicing time.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; It is a jubilee time.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:23] There has been a message of resurrection
[1:07:28] a rapture message an adoption message
[1:07:31] given to his bride.
[1:07:34] That's why in the seventh time while
[1:07:36] there is shout king
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; and these walls are coming down
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go ahead building up
[1:07:44] let's go back to our origin
[1:07:51] the young people sung about it failure
[1:07:54] failure won't define me
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; although Satan comes around and he says
[1:08:02] you did you've done this You've done
[1:08:03] that. You did this. You did that.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Your background is this. Your background
[1:08:07] is that.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Failure won't define me.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; I am a son of God. I am a daughter of
[1:08:14] God.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's about time we don't just
[1:08:18] say things, but we believe what God
[1:08:21] Amen. It's not what Satan says, what
[1:08:24] anybody says, and what God says about
[1:08:26] me.
[1:08:30] Glory. Glory. Amen. Amen. Amen. So what
[1:08:34] happens when God sends a jubilee in them
[1:08:37] days? Listen, the God that sends a
[1:08:39] Jubilee in them days is the same God
[1:08:42] that sends the Jubilee today.
[1:08:45] [Applause]
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; All the ones that were in captivity
[1:08:50] didn't have to pay any price. They could
[1:08:52] absolutely go free.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; But it was their choice.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Choose ye this day. Yes.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Tonight
[1:09:04] you can be delivered.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Tonight you can be healed.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Tonight you can be sealed.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just want to wait until Brother
[1:09:13] Ron, Brother Tim, Brother
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; No. Tonight you can be delivered.
[1:09:22] [Applause]
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:09:30] Now those that didn't want to go free,
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; what happened? The master would take an
[1:09:36] all bore the ear which marked them to
[1:09:40] serve their master forever.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; You know why it was put on the ear?
[1:09:48] Because hearing faith cometh by hearing,
[1:09:51] hearing of the word of God. So to reject
[1:09:56] the message, to reject the resurrection
[1:09:59] message, the rapture message, the
[1:10:00] Jubilee message, the word of God
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; is been born in the ear
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; and be spiritually deaf. That's why we
[1:10:11] have all this nonsense everywhere on on
[1:10:13] the internet. So don't even waste your
[1:10:15] time.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. Sorry, brother Tim, to
[1:10:19] mention that, but people try to write,
[1:10:21] you know, all kinds of mails and try to
[1:10:23] provoke. We don't even want to waste
[1:10:25] time on it. I'm getting ready. We're
[1:10:28] getting ready to leave here.
[1:10:31] There'll still be fussing and the
[1:10:33] rapture will be gone already.
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; So tonight,
[1:10:42] if you want to run,
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; don't run outside.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Run to Jesus.
[1:10:48] If you want to doubt, doubt the devil.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; If you want to hide, hide in the word
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; because there's no time for wasting.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the way, the truth, and the
[1:11:05] life. There's one way. That's Jesus.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; He came down. Listen. He came down in a
[1:11:15] blood cell. Yes.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Not through a man, but by the Holy
[1:11:19] Ghost.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; And in that virgin womb, a tabernacle
[1:11:23] for the purpose of death was built.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; So, let's look the resurrection a
[1:11:29] moment. Is that okay?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; The value I heard, can't remember who,
[1:11:36] but I heard somebody say the value of
[1:11:39] something is the price somebody is
[1:11:42] willing to pay.
[1:11:45] [Music]
[1:11:47] You can think about that
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; and you can think what he has done for
[1:11:51] me
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; for us.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; That's the value. That's your value.
[1:11:56] That's how he saw us.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; So let's never take things for granted
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; or just an ordinary service or something
[1:12:05] commonly. No,
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; God is so good to us.
[1:12:12] So we can look into the gospels.
[1:12:15] There's the four gospels and we can see
[1:12:17] that they all tell us the stories what
[1:12:21] happened around Jesus where Jesus was.
[1:12:24] So they all have different perspectives
[1:12:26] of what was going on. Now some tell it a
[1:12:29] certain way others is not. For example,
[1:12:32] there's only in John that you will read
[1:12:35] about Lazarus.
[1:12:37] But
[1:12:39] there's one thing they have in common.
[1:12:42] That is the resurrection message.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; They all write it
[1:12:48] what happened.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; So it must be something quite important.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus told exactly what would happen. He
[1:12:57] told it to his disciples. For the sake
[1:12:59] of time, you can read it in Matthew
[1:13:01] 16:21 where he says, "And I'm going to
[1:13:03] be killed and be raised again the third
[1:13:04] day."
[1:13:05] He told it even to the Pharisees,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; but they were not listening to the sound
[1:13:11] of the trumpet.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; They didn't want it because it was out
[1:13:15] of their, you know, they were so
[1:13:18] blocked, chained by traditions.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; But even there they heard it. Matthew 27
[1:13:26] says saying, "Sir, remember that dece
[1:13:29] deceiver said while he was yet alive
[1:13:31] after three days I will rise again." And
[1:13:35] people hear the word of God and they
[1:13:38] just want to continue.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; But not for me.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; It's my jubilee.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; You want You don't want your jub. It's
[1:13:49] my jubilee.
[1:13:53] So the resurrection message well didn't
[1:13:56] start by the disciples.
[1:13:59] It started by Jesus himself.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; God keeps that to himself
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; because he doesn't want anybody to
[1:14:09] interfere with whatever. It's only after
[1:14:12] in the book of Acts that you see the
[1:14:14] disciples, Amen, writing about. Amen.
[1:14:17] And the book of Acts
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; didn't stop, didn't end. Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; we are living a book of Acts.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; So now Paul says,
[1:14:32] "Knowing that he which raised up the
[1:14:34] Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by
[1:14:37] Jesus and shall present us with you." In
[1:14:40] 1 Peter 1, it says, "Blessed be the God
[1:14:42] and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:14:44] which according to his abundant mercy
[1:14:47] had begotten us unto a lively hope by
[1:14:50] the resurrection of Jesus from the dead,
[1:14:54] to an inheritance,
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; incorruptible
[1:15:00] and undefiled, and that faded not away,
[1:15:05] reserved in heaven for you.
[1:15:08] [Applause]
[1:15:10] Where is the U group here?
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; So the resurrection, the rapture message
[1:15:19] is not an ending. It's not a conclusion.
[1:15:22] It's a climax.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Revelation 1:18 says, "I am alive
[1:15:29] forever more."
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 15, "But
[1:15:35] if there be no resurrection of the dead,
[1:15:36] then Christ is not risen. And if Christ
[1:15:38] be not risen, then is our preaching in
[1:15:40] vain? And your faith is also in vain.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; But there was a resurrection.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; So God intended for men of God to preach
[1:15:50] the word,
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; not to push, play, and obey.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Hey, sorry, brother Tom, brother. And
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; hey, it might set somebody free.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about.
[1:16:06] Satan has bound so many people
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; by all kinds of ideas of man, doctrines
[1:16:11] of man. While the trumpet, the sound of
[1:16:14] freedom has been proclaimed.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; The rest in Hebrews 4, there remained
[1:16:27] therefore a rest, a Sabbath to the
[1:16:29] people of God. For he that has entered
[1:16:31] into his rest, he saw he also had ceased
[1:16:34] from his own works and God did from his.
[1:16:37] So the rest is a confirmation
[1:16:41] and makes you a witness of the
[1:16:43] resurrection.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Now follow me here. It's just some
[1:16:48] teaching building up.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; So when that happens, it's not my daddy
[1:16:55] told me that my redeemer live it. It's
[1:16:58] not a testimony of someone that told me
[1:17:01] God is alive.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; My redeemer liveth.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; I know he is alive tonight.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's living in me.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; I feel him in my hands. I feel him in my
[1:17:17] feet. I feel him all over me.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; God's not dead. He's alive.
[1:17:26] [Music]
[1:17:31] Because I live,
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; ye shall live also.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; I am the Messiah.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And you are messes.
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:47] Matthew 21:1 says, "If the in the end of
[1:17:50] the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward
[1:17:53] the first day of the week," now listen,
[1:17:57] you going to continue. I want to stay on
[1:17:58] that for a while. The Sabbath ends at
[1:18:02] sundown. When the sun goes down,
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; when the sun comes up,
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; that's the witness of a new day. Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Now, we know the Jews, they didn't name
[1:18:14] their their days and and but Matthew
[1:18:16] here, he wants to make sure
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; that everybody would recognize
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; what day we're talking about.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; This marks a changing of time. This will
[1:18:30] be the last Sabbath
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; where
[1:18:36] we will bring lambs, bring doves, we'll
[1:18:39] bring Sabbath. So after this Sabbath, it
[1:18:42] will never be the same.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Because a perfect lamb
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; was slain for me.
[1:18:55] [Music]
[1:18:56] There's a new covenant, a new day this
[1:19:00] Sunday. Prove that God is almighty.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look for a little while
[1:19:13] what we find at the tomb. Okay.
[1:19:17] The first witnesses of the resurrection
[1:19:22] were women. We know in the Bible
[1:19:27] women represents a church
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; a type. So the first witnesses of the
[1:19:33] resurrection is the church.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; What are they doing there?
[1:19:41] They have seen him lay him in a tomb.
[1:19:43] They saw him crucified. They saw all the
[1:19:45] events happening.
[1:19:48] The following day they come with spices
[1:19:50] to anoint him.
[1:19:53] They are mourning.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; They go there out of love,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; out of sympathy.
[1:20:03] They love Jesus.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; They go there,
[1:20:08] but they haven't went there for a
[1:20:11] resurrection message. That's right.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; And maybe some are here tonight
[1:20:18] and you have come out of love for your
[1:20:20] mom, for your dad,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; or maybe out of love and sympathy for
[1:20:24] for for brother Ed and Sister Ruth
[1:20:26] because it's a an anniversary.
[1:20:30] But God has a lot of plans for you.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; You will hear the resurrection message.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; You will feel the resurrection power.
[1:20:41] [Music]
[1:20:42] Stop limiting God.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Stop making your own programs
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; and surrender to God.
[1:20:51] [Applause]
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something? While they were on
[1:20:58] their way, the Bible says in Mark 16:2,
[1:21:01] "And verily early in the morning, the
[1:21:03] first day of the week, they came into
[1:21:05] the seeler at the rising of the sun."
[1:21:08] Woo!
[1:21:10] And they said among themselves, who
[1:21:13] shall roll away the stone from the door
[1:21:16] of the sepoker? So here we have these
[1:21:19] women all kinds of mind battles.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Here we have the spices. We have we will
[1:21:25] do all we can, all we have out of love.
[1:21:30] But
[1:21:31] what will happen?
[1:21:34] Who will roll away that stone?
[1:21:39] They were walking in darkness. They were
[1:21:42] waiting for the rising of the natural
[1:21:44] sun.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; But they're fixing to be witnesses of
[1:21:48] the resurrection,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; of the rising of the sen.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; They don't even know that something
[1:21:59] happened already to that stone. Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; During that time, you know, Satan tries
[1:22:06] to attack the word every time.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; He tried even while Jesus was here.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; That's the antichrist spirit that we can
[1:22:15] see working all over the world.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; But God's spirit is here and he raises a
[1:22:20] standard.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; So during that time, we can see in
[1:22:26] Matthew 26, Pilate said unto them, you
[1:22:28] have a watch, go your way. Make it as
[1:22:30] sure as ye can. Woo! Stupid devil.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; So they went and made the seulture sure,
[1:22:41] sealing the stone and setting a watch.
[1:22:45] They couldn't seal it enough.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; God is almighty and he will always break
[1:22:51] the seal to prove his resurrection.
[1:22:57] My God is awesome,
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; mighty in battle.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Matthew 28:2.
[1:23:06] We're building up here now.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Matthew 28:2. And behold, there was a
[1:23:12] great earthquake, for the angel of the
[1:23:14] Lord descended.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:1. And another mighty
[1:23:19] angel descended.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Glory. Another man, an angel from the
[1:23:25] Lord descended from heaven and came and
[1:23:26] rolled back the stone from the door and
[1:23:29] sat upon it.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[1:23:34] Come on, church.
[1:23:37] My God is almighty.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; What Rome, what Satan has sealed, God
[1:23:45] just sits on it.
[1:23:49] Satan tries to keep you bound, but Jesus
[1:23:53] set me free.
[1:23:55] Satan tries to keep you down. But Satan
[1:23:59] is finished because Jesus proclaimed me
[1:24:02] free.
[1:24:04] Glory.
[1:24:06] Glory.
[1:24:09] Boo devil.
[1:24:11] Start claiming your possession.
[1:24:14] He's but a bluff.
[1:24:16] Brother David, I heard it before. It's
[1:24:18] not I heard it before. This is the
[1:24:21] trumpet sounding telling you this is the
[1:24:25] bride's jubilee.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:24:31] Hallelujah.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; The resurrection message. The rapture
[1:24:46] message has an effect on all the
[1:24:49] surroundings.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; There was an earthquake.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that those guardians,
[1:25:03] those soldiers, they were like dead.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; They were there was a real trembling
[1:25:08] taking place.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; They ended up dead.
[1:25:18] Satan couldn't stop the angel from
[1:25:21] coming down
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; and opening that seal.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't stop the angel from
[1:25:28] coming down to open the seals for us.
[1:25:34] [Applause]
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory. Satan. He Oh, we
[1:25:38] better kick him out of here.
[1:25:40] [Applause]
[1:25:42] Come on, church.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; The Jubilee. We know the story. They
[1:25:48] climbed up the mountain. So, let's just
[1:25:50] think about it.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Think about it. You came here and
[1:25:54] tonight you going. If the trumpet
[1:25:57] sounds, you will be free.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; They send out
[1:26:03] the young,
[1:26:05] you know, trained people
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; like brother Michael who can run fast.
[1:26:12] Go on, Michael. Go there.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And when the sun rises,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; just tell us
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; because
[1:26:24] I know somebody who went up Mount
[1:26:27] Calvary, Mount Golgatha,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; and he proclaimed my freedom. He told
[1:26:33] me, I am free.
[1:26:36] So I know in whom I believe now.
[1:26:43] What's the opening of the seals
[1:26:45] revealing Christ?
[1:26:50] [Applause]
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. A few more bombs here.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; The opening of the seal
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; was wasn't broke to let Jesus out.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; You get that?
[1:27:08] The opening of the seal wasn't there to
[1:27:11] let Jesus out. Because Jesus, he can
[1:27:13] walk through walls. He can walk through
[1:27:15] the rock.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; It was there
[1:27:20] for them to go in.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[1:27:24] Only in Christ Jesus I am secure.
[1:27:29] I am safe.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; That's why the book is open and you have
[1:27:34] to go get the book. Eat the book and see
[1:27:37] who you are.
[1:27:40] Oh my Lord.
[1:27:42] Hallelujah.
[1:27:44] Talking about the Jubilee.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Here comes these women questioning. But
[1:27:54] their questions were already answered
[1:27:56] before they arrived. Their questions
[1:27:59] were answered by the message, the
[1:28:02] rapture message, the resurrection
[1:28:04] message. Amen. All doubts were settled.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[1:28:11] My the opening of the word. Oh, settled
[1:28:15] all my questions.
[1:28:18] [Applause]
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; There is no other light. There is no
[1:28:24] other life than in this message, in this
[1:28:27] word.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; This message gives us perfect faith.
[1:28:36] [Applause]
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; He who the son has set free is free
[1:28:41] indeed.
[1:28:43] Not partially free indeed.
[1:28:48] Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; And the angel Matthew 28:5 And the angel
[1:28:53] answered and said unto the woman, "Fear
[1:28:55] ye not."
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; For I know that ye seek Jesus which was
[1:29:01] crucified,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; but he is not here. He is risen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; As he said,
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; as he said, it is written, thus saith
[1:29:12] the Lord. Woo! My
[1:29:16] Come see the place where the Lord lay.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; My
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Did they see a dead corpse? No,
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; He is risen. We are not serving a dead
[1:29:31] God. God is alive.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; He's almighty.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; We're not feeding on a dead word, but
[1:29:38] the unfailing of the body word of the
[1:29:41] Son of Man. Some people may think this
[1:29:44] message is a dead word. No, no, no, no.
[1:29:47] This is a word from God Almighty sent in
[1:29:51] this end of the last age
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; for me, for you.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; So the bride's jubilee, that's why it's
[1:30:01] the bride's jubilee is a reality.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; What are you rejoicing about? Yes.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; My
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; You don't know what you're rejoicing
[1:30:12] about.
[1:30:13] Brother Bram says, "What a resurrection
[1:30:16] this was."
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; What a resurrection this is.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; My
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; The angel tells him, "Come see for
[1:30:28] yourself. I want you to be a witness
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; of the resurrection power.
[1:30:38] My my my my
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus was come later. He came to the
[1:30:46] disciples in the room through a stone
[1:30:48] wall.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; You want to talk? He says he had his
[1:30:55] glorified body says the prophet. You
[1:30:57] talk about the space age.
[1:31:01] The church is fixing to take one fast.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Now there are some people that take that
[1:31:08] personal and they takes up so much
[1:31:10] space. My ministry I I I that's not what
[1:31:14] it's saying.
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; What does the Bible say in John 3? He
[1:31:22] must increase but I must decrease. It's
[1:31:25] not what I've done, it's what he has
[1:31:27] done for me. Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; He proclaimed my liberty.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; We we we had the quotes. I thought Amen.
[1:31:36] It's not you have to pay. It's not I
[1:31:38] have to do this. It's what he has done
[1:31:41] for me.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; By grace I am saved.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; He loved me before I even could love
[1:31:48] him.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; He chose me.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; He elected me
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:31:58] my
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; then
[1:32:03] they have done what they said they would
[1:32:05] do to Jesus.
[1:32:08] They crucified him. His soul descended
[1:32:10] into hell. Preach to the souls that are
[1:32:11] in prison. He took the keys of death,
[1:32:16] hell away from the devil.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Satan wants you to believe that these
[1:32:22] prisons doors are still locked. Yeah,
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; he doesn't has the keys anymore.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; But it's up, you know, the ministers can
[1:32:31] preach it,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; but it's up to you to take a step of
[1:32:34] faith.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; It doesn't need, it's not a huge door
[1:32:38] where you need all the power and you
[1:32:40] know, let's go.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; He just opened
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; faith like a mustard seed
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; because the door's already open.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen now. I love it. I
[1:32:56] love it.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; He has taken the keys of debt and hell
[1:33:01] away from the devil. Return back on
[1:33:02] Easter morning. And as he come through
[1:33:05] paradise, he knocks at the door.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah says the prophet.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; I can hear him say, "Children, Abraham
[1:33:15] say, who is that? I'm your seed." The
[1:33:18] seed of Abraham. Abraham said, "Are we
[1:33:21] going out? It's almost daylight on
[1:33:23] earth.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord my God. And somebody can ask me,
[1:33:30] well, how are you going to be raptured?
[1:33:32] Don't you worry about that. Enoch was
[1:33:34] walking. He pleased God because he
[1:33:37] believed the word of God and he started
[1:33:40] walking. He started walking. Bye-bye
[1:33:44] world. Bye-bye world.
[1:33:48] Don't ask me to explain the physics
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; because I don't care about the physics.
[1:33:53] I know God said so and I believe it.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; My my my come on.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Abraham, are we going out? It's almost
[1:34:06] daylight on Earth.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Abraham says,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:34:13] can we make a little whistle stop? Woo.
[1:34:18] [Laughter]
[1:34:25] Can we make a little whistle stop in
[1:34:27] Jerusalem?
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Listen now.
[1:34:33] The reply of Jesus.
[1:34:36] Yes,
[1:34:38] I got 40 days.
[1:34:42] I want to instruct my disciples.
[1:34:47] They got to go in the world and cast out
[1:34:52] devils.
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus, we cast out
[1:35:00] devils.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; So, we're not we shouldn't fear them
[1:35:05] because God gave us this authority.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, "Let me go to them. I'm
[1:35:11] going to instruct them for 40 days to
[1:35:14] cast out devils. It didn't end with the
[1:35:16] disciples at that time.
[1:35:19] [Laughter]
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; I better talk to him a little while
[1:35:27] before going up so you fellows can just
[1:35:31] walk around.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; My We going to live. We're so close.
[1:35:36] Amen. To living a time, Amen. where our
[1:35:39] beloved ones will come die. Hey, we're
[1:35:41] going to be preaching. Here's brother
[1:35:43] Brandham. My You want to talk about a
[1:35:45] revival? You want to talk about the
[1:35:47] Jubilee? Oh, Brother David, I hear now
[1:35:50] the critics say, "Brother David, I'll
[1:35:52] wait until You know what? You won't see
[1:35:54] them.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; You won't see them because it's only the
[1:35:58] elect. It's only the bride that will see
[1:36:01] them. Oh my."
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; If you've never shouted before,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; you're going to shout. Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; My hallelujah.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; When because I live ye shall live also.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says he was speaking to
[1:36:20] his wife.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; my. Thank you Jesus.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:30] Amen. When he died. Amen. And he shed
[1:36:33] his blood. Listen. The perfect life of
[1:36:36] God was liberated.
[1:36:40] The perfect life of God was liberated to
[1:36:45] come back upon the sinner who would
[1:36:48] accept the Christ as his savior.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; My
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; So how are we responding
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; to the Jubilee trumpet
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; to the freedom trumpet?
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; All that God was, he emptied in Christ.
[1:37:07] All the great eternals of God was
[1:37:10] emptied in Christ. And all that Christ
[1:37:12] was, he emptied it into the church.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; And men and women are afraid to claim
[1:37:19] their God-given privilege and stand upon
[1:37:22] the truth of it. Not what you think, not
[1:37:25] what Satan says, not what anybody says,
[1:37:28] but what the truth, what the word of God
[1:37:30] says about you.
[1:37:35] We have the privilege to enforce upon
[1:37:39] Satan the claims that God has given us.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; My
[1:37:44] [Music]
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have the right to force
[1:37:51] these claims upon Satan
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; and say, "Give it back.
[1:37:59] [Applause]
[1:38:02] I heard the trumpet sound. This is my
[1:38:05] inheritance.
[1:38:07] This is my property. Get the behind me.
[1:38:13] Some of you were at camp and some of you
[1:38:16] have written something on the soul
[1:38:18] because that's where Satan belongs. But
[1:38:20] it's about time maybe you rewrite
[1:38:23] something and start putting Satan under
[1:38:26] your feet.
[1:38:28] Well, brother David, I wasn't at camp.
[1:38:31] Don't you worry. You got your time now.
[1:38:33] This is the hour of jubilee.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; This is the hour of jubilee.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Glory. Give it back. And he has to do
[1:38:46] it.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; He has to do it. That's say the Lord.
[1:38:56] [Applause]
[1:38:59] Hallelujah.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:12] And if that ain't enough,
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; we can take God's agent,
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit,
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; go route down, right down on our knees
[1:39:24] and say it's thus sayeth the Lord, he's
[1:39:27] got to give up. That's all.
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:39] That's all. Cuz the Holy Spirit is there
[1:39:41] to make him do it.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; This ain't your battle.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; He proclaimed me free.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; He gave me an open book.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; He broke the seals thereof. Therefore,
[1:39:55] my jubilee.
[1:39:56] I can rejoice. I can be glad.
[1:40:01] Worthy is the lamb.
[1:40:03] He alone is worthy.
[1:40:06] [Applause]
[1:40:08] Why are you so excited? Because I'm
[1:40:10] living in a jubilee.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; I'm living my jubilee.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And it's a reality.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; This book of Acts is a reality.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. You heard testimony. Testimony.
[1:40:24] Not just a brother Tims, not just a
[1:40:26] brother arms, not just a brother Tom's.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; All over the world, the spirit is
[1:40:33] moving.
[1:40:36] Woo! Hallelujah.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; That's the enforcement restored back to
[1:40:43] its natural condition again.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; It's not our claim. It's our claim
[1:40:50] because God gave it.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; By his stripes, we are healed.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:41:01] [Applause]
[1:41:06] I prayed and it didn't happen and
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; there's this poor me attitude.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Joshua went there
[1:41:17] with a victorious attitude.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; He knew in who he believed.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; And I'll send my angel before thee.
[1:41:31] Amen.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was wounded for our
[1:41:38] transgressions. By his stripes, we are
[1:41:39] healed.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; And the lawgiver, the Holy Spirit
[1:41:43] himself, listen, the lawgiver,
[1:41:46] not Satan,
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; that's the nonsense giver,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; the liar giver.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; That's what he is. That's his nature.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; He can seem very honest.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Very truthful.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Quote 99.9%
[1:42:12] of the truth,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; but he's still a liar.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; He's still a liar. But here
[1:42:20] the lawgiver, the Holy Spirit himself is
[1:42:24] here, the agent of God to see that it's
[1:42:28] done that way. Amen.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; My You want to talk about a jubilee?
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; That's a true jubilee.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Because when this trumpet was sound when
[1:42:45] it
[1:42:48] They put down everything.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; If you wanted to be free,
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; you could continue
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; and keep on
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; slave master.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; But it's up to you,
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; each and everyone.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; So I don't want to look to my mom, look
[1:43:10] to my dad, look to my brother, look to
[1:43:11] my sister. It's me, myself and I. Amen.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; To take a step
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; and say, "This is my jubilee.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; This is my liberty.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; This is my freedom."
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; He whom the son has set free is free
[1:43:34] indeed.
[1:43:36] And he, oh my,
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; I'm
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says once
[1:43:42] once he was freed, he could never be a
[1:43:46] slave no more.
[1:43:49] Hallelujah.
[1:43:52] You never have to live under the yoke of
[1:43:54] bondage. My God has set me free.
[1:43:58] [Applause]
[1:44:01] Therefore, it's not an excitement. Oh
[1:44:04] yeah, I can act excited, but it's a
[1:44:06] reality.
[1:44:08] The Jubilee of the bride is a reality.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:14] We've got the authority by Jesus Christ.
[1:44:18] That's the reason demons scream.
[1:44:22] [Applause]
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; We are.
[1:44:29] That's the reason demons scream.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; It's about time we give them
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; a good whapon.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Enough is enough.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Satan had me bound,
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; but Jesus set me free.
[1:44:56] Oh, brother David, that's not a deep
[1:44:58] message. Oh, yes it is.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Because Satan tries to keep you bound.
[1:45:02] Satan tries to keep you in bondage.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Try to do everything
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; to stop you from praising, worshiping
[1:45:10] God, receiving the word, receiving the
[1:45:12] blessing.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Is that okay? A few more minutes.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; My Lord.
[1:45:23] Romans 8, who shall lay anything to the
[1:45:26] charge of God's elect?
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; It is God that justifieth.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; The Greek lexican says it's pronounced
[1:45:36] dao. Sorry, my pronunciation. To render
[1:45:39] righteous, to declare one as he ought to
[1:45:44] be.
[1:45:45] [Applause]
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a
[1:45:50] son of God.
[1:45:52] [Applause]
[1:45:53] I no longer
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; ought to live here in bondage.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; I am a son and a daughter of God. Now I
[1:46:04] am
[1:46:06] [Applause]
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Let me bring it more personal now. You
[1:46:16] believe him to be the same,
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; to be the same in principle,
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; to be the same in power.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; The only thing different tonight is that
[1:46:28] he's using your flesh and my flesh.
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Joshua saw the same walls you see in
[1:46:41] your life.
[1:46:44] But he sto he took a step of faith.
[1:46:48] [Music]
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; God used Joshua.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; God used Abraham. But now he's using
[1:46:56] your flesh and my flesh. In my name, the
[1:47:00] name of Jesus. They shall cast out
[1:47:03] demons.
[1:47:06] Hallelujah.
[1:47:11] Hallelujah.
[1:47:12] [Applause]
[1:47:18] Let me take a little whistle stop, said
[1:47:20] God. Let me take a little whistle stop
[1:47:22] here at Bible Way Cloverdale.
[1:47:25] There's your anniversary going on.
[1:47:28] And I'm going to tell them I'm going to
[1:47:31] tell them that they are free indeed.
[1:47:37] That I I sound the Jubilee trumpet.
[1:47:41] And you are here to cast out demons in
[1:47:45] Jesus' name.
[1:47:47] In Jesus' name, we press on in Jesus'
[1:47:52] name. We have the victory.
[1:47:55] Hallelujah.
[1:47:57] Glory.
[1:48:00] Glory.
[1:48:03] Hallelujah.
[1:48:04] [Applause]
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Worship the Lord Almighty.
[1:48:11] Hallelujah.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Take possession.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Take possession,
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; full possession of what is yours. If you
[1:48:21] need healing, he is the same. The same
[1:48:24] power. Oh my Lord. He's the same
[1:48:27] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; You want your family restored? He's the
[1:48:35] same.
[1:48:39] Jesus just needed a whistle stop.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; I'll tell them
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; you'll cast out demons.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you than he
[1:48:51] that is in the world. Don't rely on your
[1:48:54] strength. Don't rely on any theological
[1:48:58] knowledge. Just surrender to God and
[1:49:01] say, "Here I am. Here I am. Thy will be
[1:49:04] done. Thy will be done.
[1:49:07] Fill me Lord. Fill me Lord. Break every
[1:49:11] feather. Break every feather.
[1:49:16] I can hear the Jubilee trumpet sound.
[1:49:20] I can hear it. I am free indeed.
[1:49:24] [Applause]
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:27] Hallelujah.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; That's what it's about.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Being free.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Free indeed.
[1:49:37] free indeed.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Musicians.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; He's here,
[1:49:51] but it's up to you now to claim your
[1:49:54] liberty.
[1:49:56] We can sing about it, but it's more than
[1:49:59] sing about it. I know in who I believe.
[1:50:08] Brother David doesn't know your needs,
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; but the great I am is here.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what you have need of.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; And is anything too hard for the Lord?
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Brother David, I heard that before.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Stop listening to the nonsense of Satan.
[1:50:36] if you can only believe.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; God has plans for you.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe you came questioning here,
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; having all all kinds of mind battles.
[1:50:58] Maybe this is the first time you're in
[1:51:00] church
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; and maybe this is the first time you're
[1:51:04] connected.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; God has other plans for you.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; The answer is in the rapture message.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Because I live,
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; ye shall live also.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:29] Glory be to God.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; I am a son of God.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; This is an anniversary.
[1:51:43] The Lord is directing differently,
[1:51:45] saints.
[1:51:49] But he knows
[1:51:53] what you need.
[1:51:57] So, let's not miss the moment. That's
[1:51:59] not just an anniversary.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; It's the bride's jubilee.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; This is the bride's jubilee and it's a
[1:52:11] reality.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; So, claim your God-given rights.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; He is here. The lawgiver, the Holy
[1:52:21] Spirit.
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:25] to change every situation.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:31] [Music]
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; To take away all doubt, all fear.
[1:52:38] Cuz I don't need to live any longer in
[1:52:40] the fear.
[1:52:43] God proclaimed me free. He paid my
[1:52:46] price.
[1:52:48] And I want to be a witness
[1:52:52] of the resurrection message.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; It's not me that lived, but Christ that
[1:52:57] liveth in me.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; And it's more than just a word we speak
[1:53:01] out.
[1:53:03] It's a power,
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; a resurrection power.
[1:53:10] But it has to be an individual
[1:53:12] testimony.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; So don't miss your opportunity. I'd sing
[1:53:18] that song. I'm no longer
[1:53:22] a slave
[1:53:24] to fear.
[1:53:28] I am

[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; to hear the chains of bondage broken
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; by the word of God.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; I think I said something last weekend,
[1:59:19] brother David. They need to change those
[1:59:22] words. And they didn't do it.
[1:59:27] Known from my mother's womb. I've been
[1:59:30] known before the foundation of the
[1:59:32] world.
[1:59:34] Didn't I say from my father's mind? Come
[1:59:38] on, put it up. Change it. Joseph,
[1:59:42] we we didn't just start and find out
[1:59:44] salvation. We were always saved.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; It was just the night you gave your
[1:59:49] heart to Christ that you knew you were
[1:59:52] in the mind of God before the foundation
[1:59:54] of the world.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; You never had just got eternal life.
[1:59:58] What the prophet say? You always had it.
[2:00:01] If you can't rejoice over this message
[2:00:03] tonight, you're brain dead.
[2:00:06] You might as well rejoice because our
[2:00:09] father is alive and well. He's done a
[2:00:12] whistle stop tonight at Cloverdale Bible
[2:00:16] Way.
[2:00:20] Hallelujah.
[2:00:22] Have you got that back up there? Right.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; From the mind of God,
[2:00:30] you have chosen me.
[2:00:37] [Music]
[2:00:42] Oh, I
[2:00:44] [Music]
[2:00:46] to your family.

[2:01:06] I am
[2:01:11] [Music]
[2:01:15] a slave
[2:01:17] to be.
[2:01:21] I am a child
[2:01:24] of God.
[2:01:26] [Music]
[2:01:28] I wonder tonight who can lift up their
[2:01:30] hand and say, "I dropped my hole.
[2:01:33] I drop my hole. I've heard the priest's
[2:01:37] trumpet called the trumpet jubilee. This
[2:01:41] is my jubilee.
[2:01:44] And it's about time, saints of God, we
[2:01:46] arise and take our inheritance
[2:01:49] and not be just a song, but a living
[2:01:53] revelation.
[2:01:58] It's about time we start to let the
[2:01:59] devil know, I've come from God. got to
[2:02:02] go back to God and Satan, you get behind
[2:02:05] me.
[2:02:07] You talk about a jubilee.
[2:02:11] How many tonight can say by the word of
[2:02:13] God, by the word of God, it washed me.
[2:02:17] It cleansed me. It loosed me. It set me
[2:02:21] free.
[2:02:23] Not by some excitement, but by thus
[2:02:26] sayeth the word of God.
[2:02:30] If it's by emotion, it will leave
[2:02:31] tomorrow. It will leave next week. But
[2:02:34] if it's a revelation, it will stay with
[2:02:37] you forever and ever and ever. So when
[2:02:41] the devil comes by your way and say,
[2:02:42] "Remember that hole you had?" You said,
[2:02:44] "Yeah, I left it at the Jubilee service
[2:02:48] never to pick it up again."
[2:02:54] Arise.
[2:02:56] Arise.
[2:03:01] possess your inheritance. That's a song
[2:03:04] we sing, right?

[2:14:09] I apologize if this is out of order, but
[2:14:11] I I I couldn't shake it. I I have to
[2:14:13] give a testimony. Um,
[2:14:16] I I don't know if anyone knows. My wife
[2:14:18] knows and uh, Brother Eron McGary knows.
[2:14:20] I was in Arizona and uh, God just came
[2:14:25] in a special way. But I I
[2:14:29] when my brother passed, um, I I I um, I
[2:14:36] started to really spiral and, uh, I I
[2:14:39] began I I didn't even know what it I was
[2:14:40] about to develop anxiety uh to the point
[2:14:42] where I was checking myself into the
[2:14:44] hospital and I thought I was having
[2:14:46] heart attacks.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Um I I couldn't hardly leave the house.
[2:14:49] My wife would be wondering like what's
[2:14:50] going on? It's a nice day. You need to
[2:14:52] get some things done. When I would
[2:14:53] actually work for somebody, I I was
[2:14:55] showing up late all the time because I I
[2:14:57] was so it was getting so bad to where I
[2:14:59] couldn't hardly leave the house. I was
[2:15:00] trying to make excuses for everything. I
[2:15:02] was trying to make excuses not to go
[2:15:03] out. we get invited out and I just want
[2:15:06] to apologize to the
[2:15:09] I haven't really opened my home. I
[2:15:11] haven't I've been hiding. I've been
[2:15:13] under such a I I even
[2:15:16] it's almost embarrassing to say I I
[2:15:18] started seeing a a doctor
[2:15:21] and uh I would take psych texts and u I
[2:15:27] I was in you know I mental health was a
[2:15:30] real situation and I don't know if
[2:15:33] there's anyone else dealing with it but
[2:15:35] we heard sister Julie God gave me
[2:15:38] opportunity to be at camp with my son
[2:15:43] and sister Julie said she began to
[2:15:44] praise and depression left her. she was
[2:15:48] in bed
[2:15:49] and and we hear about depression and I
[2:15:52] didn't know anything about anxiety but
[2:15:55] I've certainly learned in a in a few
[2:15:57] short years and brother Aaron began to
[2:15:59] speak a service and about boundaries
[2:16:03] and if he's listening God bless you
[2:16:04] brother Aaron uh and barriers and
[2:16:06] boundaries and he just began to talk
[2:16:08] about these things and everything that
[2:16:11] he talked about was was me it was me it
[2:16:13] was me and he just began to say I know
[2:16:15] this young he know young man who lost
[2:16:17] lost a loved one and he could never get
[2:16:20] uh back up on his feet. And um and I'm
[2:16:24] like, "That's me. That's me." And I
[2:16:26] don't know who he was speaking about,
[2:16:28] but I just claimed that that's me.
[2:16:30] And that moment I have not had any
[2:16:33] anxiety since it's been like two months.
[2:16:37] And this is my jubilee.
