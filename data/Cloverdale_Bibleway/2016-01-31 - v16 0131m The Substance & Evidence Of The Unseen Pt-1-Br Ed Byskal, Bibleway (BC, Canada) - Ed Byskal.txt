I'm going to ask brother Jean Manassie to come and lead us to the throne of grace. If we could just play that song, Jesus paid it all. We haven't got any prayer requests written in, but I know we have many needs. And we just also want to remember uh Happy Valley Church this morning.

Our brother John Manassie to sing that chorus once more. Jesus made it all by sing. [Music] Let's pray it. Heavenly Father, we come into your presence this morning, Lord Jesus Christ, with an expectation in our hearts. Lord, our hearts are rejoicing, Father, to be in the house of God. Lord, where we know we're not going to hear from a man, but we're going to hear from Almighty God. Father, the instructions that we need, Father, to get closer to that change in the body, the instructions we need to get closer to that rapturing faith, Lord Jesus. I've come this morning expecting, Lord God, in my heart, Lord Jesus, this is a great desire for you, Father. This is a greater love for you, oh God, this morning, oh Jesus. I'm so grateful for all that you've done for us this year already, Father. and you're taking your church higher, oh God. Our desire is that you take us to higher grounds, oh Father, that will be so lost into your love, oh God. So love, so lost in the depths of your love, Father Jesus. I pray, oh God, that you lift up the congregation, oh Lord Jesus, in the atmosphere that we that require you, Father, to bring forth your word, Lord. As a prophet say, it's the atmosphere that produces the result, Father. And I pray that our praise and worship, Father, will be pleasing to you, oh God. That you'll bless the offerings this morning, Father. Any person here who has a request in his heart, Lord God, you know our hearts, Father. The word of God is a discerner, Lord Jesus. We don't need to write it down necessarily, but God, we know that your word, Lord God, can go and directly meet our needs this morning. Father, if there's needs, Father, for healing in the body, Lord God, we believe, Father, that you died for our sins, that you die for our healing, Lord Jesus. We come believing for our loved ones, oh Father, they don't know you yet, Lord God. for the backsliders, Lord Jesus Christ. I pray, oh father, this morning, Lord God, by the preaching of the word that you inspire faith in our hearts to claim them, Lord Jesus, for the fathers and mothers, praying for the daughters and sons, oh God, that we apply the token this morning with our prayer and we'll claim Lord Jesus Christ. for ourselves, oh God, needing, Father, a greater walk with you, needing a greater baptism. Father, I pray that you just baptize each five bird of our body with the Holy Spirit, oh God, that will walk out of this place a different people. Oh Jesus, your consecrated people, oh Jesus, we want this morning to be a special meeting, Lord God. Not because they were special people necessarily, but because you're a special God in midst of his people this morning. Lord God, Lord God, when the God came down in the mountain, Father, the prophet said the mountain became holy, not because of the mountain, but because of holy God. Lord, let this congregation be holy because the holy God is in our midst this morning, oh, Father, and because you're in our midst, all things are possible, Lord Jesus. We believe, oh God, we believe for the impossible this morning. Thank you, Father, as we sing it, Lord. It's already done, Lord God. It is well with my soul. It's our confession this morning. You're the high priest of our confession, Lord. We put it upon our lips, Lord God, that all is well. And we thank you for the things that you've granted us already, Lord, for you hear us when we pray. Thank you, Lord, for all the things that you have done in our lives. May you bless the musician, Lord. Bless the song service. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother, we have your seat. Just going to ask brother Peta to get ready for his special. And let's just sing that song. It was a great thing that he did for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Number 278. &gt;&gt; Start with a start with a chorus. It was a great day that before. It was great. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Yeah.

That's how bad it is. So, um, Sunday before I think brother Tim came back from South Africa, I asked the Lord what you do for that sister, you can do it for me. So, I said I go to bed. I prayed as Lord when I woke up in the morning, I want to go to work. I woke up in the morning 100% So I just want to thank the Lord today. [Applause] I'm nervous. It's been a while. [Music] While the world looks upon me as I struggle along, they say I have nothing. But they are so wrong. In my heart I'm rejoicing. How I wish they could see. Thank you, Lord, for your blessing on me. [Music] There's a roof up above me. I've got a good place to sleep. There's food on the table and shoes on my feet. You gave me your love, Lord, and a fine family. [Music] Thank you, Lord, for your blessing on me. I know I'm not wealthy. These clothes they not new. I don't have much money.

Well, we have brother Ryan and his wife, Sister Elaine, up here. Brother Ryan is not in his usual official position leading the song service or playing the piano or singing a special or leading the choir, but he's in a very official position. He's a daddy. &gt;&gt; And Sister Ya is a mama. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's a God-given position. So, I had a few things to say and uh I hope there's other members of the family. They'll probably either be streaming or and if you're streaming, we say God bless you. &gt;&gt; If you're here present, God bless you. &gt;&gt; And uh I'm asking that may the word of God &gt;&gt; hover over this sun that we're going to dedicate. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh to perform your desire. And I say that to you, brother Ryan and Sister Elena. You have desires toward your children and to this son that you want to dedicate. And I just felt that to say to you that may the Holy Spirit hover over this boy to perform your desires for him. They have named this child Josiah James Hayes. And Josiah, as soon as you mentioned that, Brother Ryan, I didn't say anything to you, but it's one of my favorite persons in the Bible. So, this this is easy. I can speak from my heart. And uh but I don't know if you realized you have one name from the Old Testament and one from the New. My favorite uh scripture concerning Josiah, God said this, "Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes and wept before me, I also have heard thee, sayeth the Lord. And I just pray that the God who spoke that will be near this boy all of his days. The second name that you've chose is James. And I want to say I want to speak to the congregation and to Ryan James and sister Elena together. James was a brother of John, one of the first disciples called by Jesus to follow him. James left all and followed him. James was with Jesus on the mount of transfiguration. James was there when Jesus said, "Who touched me?" And the ruler of the synagogue was also there and stood nearby because he was bes he wanted to beseech the Lord for his 12-year-old daughter that was dead dreadfully sick. And the Bible says that the ruler of the synagogue while he was standing there his servants came and said don't trouble the master. James is standing there all this time. Don't trouble the master. Your daughter has died. And Jesus took his disciples only. He suffered no man to follow him save Peter and James and John. James was there when the great draft draft of fishes were caught and saw Peter fall at the knees of Jesus and say depart from me for I am a sinful man. And the Bible says that they left all. They forsook all and followed him. James was one of those. James uh Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him into Gethsemane. James is the first apostle to be martyed. So I want to say to this couple today, Josiah is a wonderful name of the Old Testament, one of the one of the admired and kings that found his way to the heart of God. And James found his way to the heart of Jesus. He was always with him. And so you don't That's wonderful. James Josiah, you're a wonderful boy. I asked Brother Ryan, does he have a quiet spirit? Because I'm going to take a few moments And it's James in the New Testament that has said the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed any sin they shall be forgiven him. The Bible says that when Simon Peter saw it and fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I'm a sinful man, oh Lord." And he was astonished and all that were with him at all the fishes that they caught. And they fell down at his knees. And so also was James and John, the sons of Zebedee, also called the sons of thunder. But there was something that was unusual and you had said this to me, Brother Ryan, in your email. We wrestled, we being brother Ryan and Sister Ulena, we wrestled with what to name him for some time and didn't really lean toward Josiah until a few weeks before his birth. Brother D Ryan said, "I began to read on Josiah in the scriptures, and that's wonderful. And it was when I read 2 Kings 23:25 that I began to really feel it was the name he was supposed to have." And I'll say to you that are getting married or you that are looking for children or when you have children, it's important that you take serious thought what you call a child. And like unto him, there was no king before him that turned to the Lord with all of his heart and all his soul. This was in Ryan's email to me. and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses, neither after him arose there any like him. And they've called this boy by that man's name. I think that that speaks well of what's in the heart of this mother and father to call him. And it says an interesting account that we took as confirmation for Josiah's name. The day he was born, I left the hospital. That's Ryan. Left the hospital to get Yolena something to eat as the doctor felt it would be several hours before the baby came. Do you remember that, Elena? You remember that? I guess you wouldn't forget. He said, "While I was away, I received a text from Elena's mother, Sister Mel Medlanka, and she had just heard from her sister, Danka, who was unaware that Elena was currently in the hospital about to deliver Josiah." And Danka had just been reading in the Bible, first Kings 13:1 and2. And behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto Bethl to Gerobam. And Gerobam, so that you probably know, Brother Ryan, Sister Elena, and I want the congregation to know, was a was a king, but he took to be a high priest. He took it upon himself to be a priest and he he retained all kinds of other people to be priests and to handle the word of God and to burn incense etc etc and so a man of God came they I don't think he's even named and he cries out he's a man from Judah and he cries out against Josiah I not Josiah but against Gerobam who had he was king over 10 of the nations or 10 of the tribes I should of Israel. And and he had taken his he taken a position that was not his to handle uh incense before God. And this man and he cried against the altar in the in the word of the Lord and and said, "Oh altar, altar, thus saith the Lord, behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name, and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon him." It wasn't that he offered the priests, but he offered their bones. Those that had died and he offered their bones. And this man was crying against it. &gt;&gt; And he said, "A child will be born, a different child." And she immediately, this is Sister Danka, doesn't know that Yolena's in the hospital and calls Yolena's mother asking, "Is he here? Has Josiah come?" I was very touched, Ryan said, when I received it. And I'd still struggled with what his name should be and felt the Lord was very mindful of our desire in choosing the right name for our son. &gt;&gt; And I believe you've chosen the right name for your son. And uh you tell your mom that I I read this. If she's not streaming right, she's here. God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; We're going to dedicate Josiah Isn't he a fine boy? We'll pray. Heavenly Father, we are touched and moved at your word. You know all things from beginning to end. And you know even the word that you've put on my heart today. and how I waited before you regarding this dedication and you found Josiah in the Bible. You ordained him to be a king and you ordained him as a young boy at 8 years old to become a king. And when he was 18, he found the book, &gt;&gt; oh God, and he began to turn the hearts of Israel towards you. and he made such a repentance and he wept when he found the book. May that spirit be upon this son. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, oh God, as you have given Josiah to sister Yolina and brother Ryan that they will raise him in the fear of the Lord. And Lord, I pray your blessing upon him. I pray your Holy Spirit shall come not only upon him but into him. We dedicate him to you. We dedicate him for all the days that you give him upon the earth. And whatever time we have from now till the rapture, use him. I pray. I pray you'll use his father and his mother. Oh God. You will gift them with divine wisdom. May they have a source, oh God, from the throne of God to raise their children in this wicked and vile and dark generation. May they be lights, oh God. May this son be a light. Use him. I pray in the name of Jesus. May your hand be upon him from this day forward. May your hand be upon his parents. May your hand be upon his grandparents, oh God. And may all of them be blessed because of his life in the name of Jesus Christ. May he learn of you, Lord Jesus. May he learn of you. And I pray may he be like James, oh God, one that will be close to your heart. Father, I dedicate Josiah James Hayes to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Elena. God bless you. Bless you, brother Ryan. And God bless you, Josiah. You may wonder why we take so much time. Some of the some of the messages which I find are so very very important that brother Brandham was speaking. He had time to dedicate the children. Did you ever think of that? Of course you did. Sometime I'm so waiting for the message. I think, oh, are these are these kids this important? I guess they are. They are certainly to the mothers and fathers. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to speak to you this morning. &gt;&gt; And I I want to really ask you to pray for yourself sincerely. God, give me eyes to see our heart to understand what it is you've spoken to us in this generation. What you've spoken to us, the wonderful things you've left in the word of God. I know without even asking that we've all read the scripture and we wondered, what does that mean? Thank God for a prophet that gave us some understanding &gt;&gt; in these things. Amen. Amen. I wonder if I you would stand with me and I'm going to ask you to come. Brother Nathan, I want to just sing uh We'll walk the the course. We'll walk in the light, the beautiful light. We are here [Music] for mercy. Oh sh all around us. I high Jesus light on the world. Now, I'd like to I'd like to have you just personalize it and sing it. Uh sing it as a prayer, but don't sing it quite as slow as you're singing it. I'd like to just pick it up. That's brother Ed's speed. will walk in the light. It's a beautiful light [Music] of mercy. Oh sh all around us, my Jesus light. [Music] [Applause] [Music] All around my head and my life, [Music] the light of the world. While you're standing, we'll pray. Heavenly Father, we're coming to you not in a formality. We're coming to you because we want to come to you. We're coming to you because you have invited us to come. And you have invited us because you desire to pour out your blessings, multiple blessings. You want to pour out the spirit of revelation, the spirit of adoption. Cause us to mature in the word of God. I pray you'll cause us to see things we have not seen before. Things that will inspire us, things that will let us know who we are in the body of Jesus Christ. Bless these dear people. I pray, Father, as we call one another brothers and sisters in the kingdom of God, children of the living God. In the name of Jesus Christ, we claim it as our own possession. Amen. And amen. Amen. God bless you as you turn in the Bible to Hebrews the 11th chapter. [Music] I don't want to make a couple of comments about Hebrews 11. I am praying and I really desire that it will be more than a scripture reading. I pray that you will also remember me in prayer as I uh come to this. I've been pondering this for some time. Uh we need to identify ourselves in the scripture. &gt;&gt; And once we identify ourselves, we need to accept that. &gt;&gt; And we need to accept it so completely that Satan will have no way to attack it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll say God said this and you have no part of God's word. &gt;&gt; And that's where I want you to come to this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. A life lived for God is the substance and the evidence of things not seen. I'm just saying that as a pre to prelude the reading of the scripture. The Old Testament saints are recorded in Hebrews 11, which is called often the faith chapter, and they fulfilled and thus essentially are the Old Testament. They are the Old Testament. Without the characters, without those that are recorded in Hebrews 11, you don't have an Old Testament. That's right. So it's not that the Old Testament is something that God wrote and somehow these people were involved. That's not it. It is that God recorded their lives &gt;&gt; and that was his word being lived out through them &gt;&gt; and that was the Old Testament. And it concluded with Jesus Christ who was the word. This is where I'm going. And the prophet of God has said, "The bride of Jesus Christ, the piece that was struck off of the masterpiece, she will fulfill the New Testament." &gt;&gt; I want you to say, and I want you to know today, and whether you think that I go overboard, that's perfectly fine. But I want to say things in in such a straight direct way. You are not here merely going to church. You are not here just to worship even around a message that has been sent. &gt;&gt; You are here because God has certain people, &gt;&gt; certain individuals and and he they are certain individuals. They're elect of God &gt;&gt; and God brought by their way his word and they believed it because they were ordained to believe it &gt;&gt; and they are the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might say that's overboard. Somebody's got to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; And you might as well take it and say it and declare it and say that is me. &gt;&gt; I have been called into this. &gt;&gt; So the bride of Jesus Christ will fulfill the new testament and brother Brandham simply says husband and wife. The old testament the new testament is simply husband and wife. So now we will read out of uh Hebrews the 11th chapter just a verse or two. Now faith verse one. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen. I'm going to let you have your seats. Maybe we can just dim the lights a wee bit. Faith is the substance of things hoped for. the evidence of things not seen. Now, this is where I'll be going. You are substance. &gt;&gt; And I will show you in the scripture where God knew about your substance before your mother and father did. &gt;&gt; God knew about your substance &gt;&gt; before you were ever thought of. Amen. &gt;&gt; When your forefathers were here, maybe with clubs on their back, God knew that you were going to be here. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, his election in his mind is so the prophet said, "God can learn nothing. &gt;&gt; He knew everything. He's omnipresent and he's omnisient." Now, in case I go over your head, just forget that. I I I spoke a couple of these things to my wife and I said, "Now, don't think about it. This is just what he said. &gt;&gt; Just accept that. &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out." Because the thing is, you can't figure it out. I can't figure it out. You can't figure it out. Nobody. And anyone who tries to figure it out simply gets more tangled up. &gt;&gt; You accept that? &gt;&gt; Amen. And the evidence, their lives that were lived out was the evidence of the unseen God. &gt;&gt; That there was an unseen God at some point in their life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What they lived and what they held to and what they believed and what they confessed. Now, we're not talking about their errors and their mistakes. They all made mistakes. The prophet said, "All the prophets had flaws. &gt;&gt; All of them had flaws. &gt;&gt; We all have flaws. &gt;&gt; God's not holding back redemption because of our flaws. &gt;&gt; He in fact will turn flaws into the very glory of God. Even Even if he has to save some from the very depths, &gt;&gt; the very depths of sin, &gt;&gt; even if he has to take a harlot and make her and bring her into the motherhood of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; someone you wouldn't have as your neighbor &gt;&gt; to our shame &gt;&gt; because we just don't have enough h of of God's mind and God's thought and God's attribute. God is so complete in his redemption &gt;&gt; and he wanted to he wanted it to be so forward in the scripture. So he'll put it in the most uh famous book that ever struck the earth, the Bible. &gt;&gt; And he will write it right in the scripture. And he will he will put uh he will put women that were not uh not only below the perfect he will take not only imperfect &gt;&gt; but he will take reprobate &gt;&gt; as the world would say repbate &gt;&gt; because he is declaring the power of his creative blood. &gt;&gt; I'm going to redeem these people. I'm going to redeem them. And not only redeem them, I'm not merely going to forgive them. I'm going to make them spotless. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring them in from the old creation into the new creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11 is a record of ordinary people who believed what God promised and thus became the evidence of things not seen. They essentially are the Old Testament substance and here's the meaning of the word and we will we will just uh major on certain things. It will be confidence and that is no surprise to you also. They have a word that just says person. It it it substance is a person can be a person. You all are persons and you all are substance and that's the substance I want to I want to emphasize today. Sorry, I want to go back please. That which has foundation substance is that which has foundation is firm. Hence that which has actual existence, actual existence, a substance, a real being, the substantial quality or nature of a person, the steadfastness of mind, courage, firm trust, assurance in fact is because you are the substance of God. You can't be moved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth of it. And that is why the word has to be assurance and firmness and foundation. You have all of those. &gt;&gt; The believer has all of those. &gt;&gt; The believer cannot be moved. If you can be moved, you aren't a believer. &gt;&gt; But a believer cannot be moved. A believer cannot give up. &gt;&gt; Just can't give up. may get to the point and and others around the country might think that uh they they should give up or they would give up but they can't give up &gt;&gt; the steadfastness of mind and courage. Could I go to the next one? Thank you. We are still on substance. It's to cause or make to stand to be immovable. You think or perhaps you thought, well, the day came when I became convinced and I received Christ. That's partially true. But you couldn't receive him unless he received you. &gt;&gt; He called you. as many as are called, &gt;&gt; he glorified. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's done the work &gt;&gt; and we give him all the glory &gt;&gt; uh to be substances to cause to stand, to be immovable, to make firm, to establish, to cause a person to keep his or her place, to cause them to keep the place. Satan may have attempted to move you a multitude of times, but he has failed. He's the one that's failed. Not you failed. He failed. &gt;&gt; He could not make you move. &gt;&gt; To stand unharmed. Oh my, how many times you may feel that God has allowed you to be harmed. You're not harmed. ready or prepared to be a steadfast mind and one who does not hesitate &gt;&gt; and does not waver. &gt;&gt; I'd like the congregation to say does not waver. &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. Does not waver. &gt;&gt; Satan, have you heard that? &gt;&gt; Does not waver. &gt;&gt; The the redeemed of the Lord &gt;&gt; said, does not waver. steadfast, has a foundation, immovable, has an assurance, and we are the persons. &gt;&gt; We are the substance. &gt;&gt; That is our substance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Christianity, the prophet said, cannot be understood. &gt;&gt; We ought to make that a a motto. Christianity cannot be understood. Not not the Christianity of the world. This Christianity cannot be understood. It is to be lived. &gt;&gt; Well, we say amen. &gt;&gt; It is to be lived by faith. We do these things. The whole works is by faith through grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the scriptures that we have here, I haven't got time to go into them in Hebrews 11, but by faith Abel, notice where it starts in the garden. By faith Abel, by faith Enoch, by faith Noah, by faith Abraham, and through faith also Sarah herself received strength. And I'm reading that because she received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child, when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. Therefore, the Bible says, "Therefore sprang thereup." This is the 12th verse, the 11th chapter. Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in the multitude in multitude, and as the sand of the sea uh and the sand of and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable. The Bible says these all the verse 13 these all died in faith not having received the promises. They died while they lived. They lived but they died in faith because that's what they were. &gt;&gt; That's what the substance was. They died in faith believing things that uh they had not seen yet. &gt;&gt; But their lives were declaring the unseen. &gt;&gt; That's what you're here for. you you're not here, friends, you're not here to simply get an education. I say to the young people, you're not here m merely to enter a profession. That's not why you're here. You're here because God called you to be here. And I want to show you from the prophet's ministry how how he declared it &gt;&gt; and and and how we should esteem that uh that prophet of God and God's work down through the ages. how he speaks of bringing the masterpiece of Jesus Christ for about 4,000 years and then at Calvary strikes him to strike off a piece for out of him came the life &gt;&gt; the life of the new creation and that's why he declared to the seventh messenger in the book of revelation that he was the new the beginning of the new creation &gt;&gt; oh my &gt;&gt; do you hear me &gt;&gt; the beginning of the new creation And this same Bible says that you are in Christ. So you are in the new creation. &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. And thus we saying, of course, I am a new creation. &gt;&gt; I'm a newb born. That's why we have a new birth. Except you be born again, you cannot see the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And these all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having I want you to notice about four things here. Having number one seen them a far off. Not everybody saw them. These people saw them. They saw the promises a far off. They p they were persuaded of them. Number &gt;&gt; and embraced them. number three &gt;&gt; and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. &gt;&gt; You need to confess that &gt;&gt; I'm in my work. I'm doing my duties. I'm at my job. I'm to do the best I can because I'm a child of God. I I'm to do the very best I can. But they don't own my soul. &gt;&gt; My soul is from God. They they can they can have the labors of this body, &gt;&gt; but they do not own my soul. I must feed my soul. I must have time with my God. I worship my God. That has nothing to do with this world. &gt;&gt; This world cannot see the promises of God the way God is showing them to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they seen the promises a far off and they were persuaded of them and we should be putting ourselves &gt;&gt; in front of that &gt;&gt; and we are persuaded of them &gt;&gt; and we embrace them &gt;&gt; and we confess as a result of all of this process. We confess that we're strangers and pilgrims here. If you feel uncomfortable in this world, good. &gt;&gt; This world is not a welcome place for the believer. &gt;&gt; And by faith, it goes on then after Abraham and by and Sarah, by faith Isaac, and by faith Jacob, by faith Joseph, by faith Moses, by faith the harlot Rahab. My what's she doing in there? And what shall I say more? For the time would fail me &gt;&gt; to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of Jeff. Jeff was born of a harlot. &gt;&gt; And David also and Samuel and of the prophets. Listen friends, when I drop in and say he's the son of a harlot, don't fall quiet. Right. &gt;&gt; Say, "Glory, &gt;&gt; great is our God. &gt;&gt; And what shall I say more of these?" &gt;&gt; It says, "Quench the violence of fire, escape the edge of the sword. Out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant and valiant in fight. And turn to flight the armies of the aliens." How did they do that? By their own power and strength? No, &gt;&gt; no. By the power of God. &gt;&gt; And now in the New Testament, the bride of Jesus Christ is casting out demons and sending the word of God amongst the people. &gt;&gt; And even if you could see it just now, Satan hates these words that I'm saying because it's going to defeat him &gt;&gt; in people's lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's going to set people that he has bound free and shackles are going to fall and sick people are going to be healed. Not because of myself. No, not at all. That's because of the word of the living God. And that's what the word does. The word heals. The word defeats the enemy. The word sends the aliens to flight and flight. And I say, "Glory be to this God." &gt;&gt; I'm not up here just because I'm inspired. I'm up here because that's God's holy word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there is no one like our God. &gt;&gt; He called you. &gt;&gt; You need to say that you called me. &gt;&gt; You brought me here. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here in this building today. We're not interested in a Cloverdale Bible Way Church. We're interested in a place we can hear the word of God, where we can fellowship with people of like, precious faith. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promises. God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect or not be made complete. All of these heroes, &gt;&gt; do you hear me? &gt;&gt; All of these heroes are depending upon us, depending upon you sitting here listening to me today. I'm simply telling you this is what God has said. This is what God thinks. And God let them live their lives and the whole Old Testament record with all the great courage that they showed. and they were slain and cast before lions and and and and went into bondage also. God's people went into bondage, but God would deliver them when they cried in in repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I have some other scriptures. There one theme today. It's the substance. &gt;&gt; You are that substance. Hallelujah. David said, "My substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret, and curiously rot in the lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance or my embryo or my fetus, yet being unperfect. And in thy book all my members were written, which in continuence were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. &gt;&gt; That's our God. &gt;&gt; That's when he saw you. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, how precious also are thy thoughts unto me. unto me, &gt;&gt; oh God, how great is the sum of them. &gt;&gt; If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand. &gt;&gt; And when I awake, I am still with thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when I awake, I'm still with thee. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hello. Wake up, folks. &gt;&gt; I'm still with thee. That means I'm with you now. But when I awake, I'm still with &gt;&gt; thee. I want the next slide, please. When a man lives, that's the one I want. When a man lives by faith and walks by faith. Now, if if we think that faith is something, I've got to get somehow get this faith. No, what you have to do is believe what he said. &gt;&gt; To believe it, simply believe it. That's faith. &gt;&gt; To doubt it, that's sin. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. That's where it begins and that's where it ends. &gt;&gt; To believe it is faith. &gt;&gt; And to doubt it is sin. &gt;&gt; And all the other things that goes on in the world is attributes of sin. &gt;&gt; That's why they didn't really matter that much to God. I may qualify that. Are there great sins? Yeah, there are. There were sins in the Old Testament that were the that they required the death penalty and that's why Jesus died. He did the death penalty for us. And that is why they could take those from the Old Testament that even should have been burned or should have died and God took them and placed them in the most holy and revered place in the very motherhood and lineage of Jesus Christ. When a man lives by faith and walks by faith, I mean substance faith, he is isolated from the entire world. And because and becomes a new creature in Christ there. Now you're getting into bride material. &gt;&gt; You're getting into rapturing condition. &gt;&gt; Now he said that means more. That means for each one of us not just the pastor, deacons, trustees, but means that for the leoty may means for the leoty. Every individual walks in a world with God alone. Every individual, I don't care how young you are. I don't care how old you are. I don't care if you're married, unmarried, or anything else. That has nothing to do with that. Every individual that's in this category that walks by faith and walks by in fact is if you're a believer, you walk by faith because of what you're believing. You simply believe it. &gt;&gt; And maybe you can't even explain why you believe it. I don't know why I believe it, but I believe these things. I believe it. And you leave the result in the consequence of God. And you live as an individual walks in the world alone with God or with God alone. You're baptized. This is continuing on. You're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and God. &gt;&gt; He gives the orders &gt;&gt; and you pack them out. &gt;&gt; He gives the orders. He gives the word and you live it out. &gt;&gt; You're the substance. &gt;&gt; You receive the orders. &gt;&gt; You receive them and you believe them &gt;&gt; and you live them out. You pack it out. You live them out. And thus you are giving evidence of the unseen God. You pack them out. Whatever he says. There's not a shadow of doubt nowhere. You walk right on it. If the Lord says this, there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it. &gt;&gt; You go right on just the same. Now you're coming into perfect faith. Perfect. Perfect perfection that cannot fail. That faith never fails. &gt;&gt; That's a kind of faith. And that is so simple. Whatever you do, don't stumble over the simplicity of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I say believe, I'm not don't don't put it at the in the category of people who believe a say a certain religion. Say, well, I'm a believer. I I believe a certain religion or I believe a certain doctrine, I believe a certain uh uh a certain thing that's personal or private to me or whatever more. That's not it. I'm talking about, and I'll be coming to it in a few moments, believing something that God supernaturally vindicates. &gt;&gt; It really hinges there because that's the only difference really. When it boils down to it, that's the only difference. I believe a vindicated word. When I say a vindicated word, a proven word at somewhere along the line, God comes and and he does it. And when he does it, uh uh I'm I'm just holding myself back because I I want you to say very very keen and very very alert. When God does it, there's no human involved. Right. &gt;&gt; I know a lot of you know say about the meetings in Switzerland. Oh, are you going to Switzerland? Are there going to be meetings in Switzerland? Da da da. And I know that that gets into the convention category. That's not what it is. &gt;&gt; The meetings in Switzerland began in a chair that I can show you in my study. And you young men that were there and others that were there see where I sit when I study. sitting in that chair looking at a computer screen that technology provided and getting an email on the internet that technology has provided and reading two lines because I did go to school for a short time and I could read and say you know I heard I saw the message and I was streamed the message and I was blessed by the message and then comes a voice. This is a wounded one and her husband doesn't know she's written this &gt;&gt; that I didn't invite &gt;&gt; that I didn't call for &gt;&gt; that I didn't try to generate &gt;&gt; something I didn't try to get into some holy place that I believed &gt;&gt; because it was divine &gt;&gt; because it wasn't human. Now, if a voice said, "Go and do some dastardly thing and some terrible crime," I would know it was from another place. But when it says, "This is a wounded one." And her husband doesn't know she's written this. I go back to that often over the last seven years and say, "You spoke that. &gt;&gt; You had a plan. That was your voice." And I act on that voice. And because of that, &gt;&gt; we get on a plane. Because of that we will we will speak to other people. Because of that we would invite. Because of that people are coming from maybe about 20 countries. One of the biggest problems right now they don't know where they will put all the people. One of the brothers said I need a jackhammer to be able to uh remove a concrete wall. They extended it last year so it to go from 300 people to 400 people. Are we are we enthused about the numbers? No, no, not a bit. &gt;&gt; Not a bit. That whatever may maybe they come because it's a convention or a special meeting or whatever more. I'll tell you that some people come simply because there was a there was a certain atmosphere. &gt;&gt; It was as though God put his hand around it. And the best way I could describe it, it was as though God cast a cover over it with a draw string on the bottom and pulled it tight. And I told people after the first meeting, God is saying, "This is mine. &gt;&gt; And I won't let anyone touch it. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let anybody disturb this." And people were there from from this side to this side. And they were as far apart in their doctrine as you could believe. One was maybe hyping up one thing and another one, another one, and somebody staying out of it all. And God pulled them all into one in one place and said pulled a drawstring and he didn't even allow one ounce in seven years. I haven't heard anybody even make a suggestion of a doctrine, anything of anything special. They're just so happy to come and hear the word of God. Do you know what? People are fed up with personalities. They're fed up with man's efforts. They're fed up. They're just fed up with all these issues and doctrines. They want to hear the word of God. And you want to sit here and pray for the men that stand behind this pulpit. Oh God, end them with your word and endo and illuminate my mind so that I understand what you have said. That's all we're here for, friends. We're not here to play church. We're not here for a social gathering. We're here that we might hear the word of God. And I said to our Lord Jesus this morning, Lord Jesus, I don't even know how to pray. But when we come to the house of God, will you please continue? You build your church. &gt;&gt; You build your people. &gt;&gt; You take the substance and build it stone by stone. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. By faith Abraham when he was called to go into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, he obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went. by faith. Abraham the substance. Abraham is the substance. He's a man like you men. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; He's a man like you, brother Peter, that sang a song. &gt;&gt; He's a man like you men who have gone through deep trials and went through impossible situations. And Sarah's a woman like you women. You've had all kinds of difficulties. She's had all kinds. They had they had strife in their home between Hagar and her. And they had an Ishmamail and a situation. And Abraham had strife between the servants of Lot's cattle and his cattle. And they had all kinds of different kinds of struggles. But he had one thing in mind. That is God spoke. &gt;&gt; God said, and I believe that. And by that he became your father. &gt;&gt; He became the father of the faith. &gt;&gt; Why the father? Because he believed what God said. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said these visions are perfectly true. &gt;&gt; They are sent from God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Why? Because a man, I can't just stand here and say, "I'm going to have a vision." &gt;&gt; That has to come from another dimension. &gt;&gt; That has to come from another realm. &gt;&gt; That has to come to one who's selected and elected to be able to receive those things. &gt;&gt; Have to be born that way. I have desired many times, please don't read this ahead of me. I desired many times so I could try and convey to you people things in brother Benham's life and ministry that would help you to understand where the message comes from and what you've been called into. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And so lay everything aside just now for a moment as I read. This is probably one of the best that I have read. I read it to the brothers in the study last Sunday. I was so impressed with it. Brother Brandham said, "I would never bring a person to the platform if it wasn't for one thing, that I might get face to face with the person." Many times out in the building, you'll hear me call people and things. I see it materialize to stop there. He sees something materialize. He said, "Many times out in the building, you'll hear me call people." So he calls a certain identifies a certain person. He said, "And I see it materialize." The very life before me materializes. Life, that's kind of an ambiguous statement. What is life? What is life? But he sees life. You say, "Well, it's material substance." Well, it hasn't yet. He sees it materialize. He sees He knows that it's life and it materializes. the very life before me materializes. Maybe I start here and look out yonder and I see a little girl say and it'll start materializing and I see the way she's and he stops. He stops. He needs to stop because he's he he can't make it everything hypothetical. He said something happens and I'll just start speaking what I see. So he sees a little girl and he just it's materializing. The life is materializing. He sees a little girl and then something happens. So then he just starts to speak what he sees happening and then he speaks I he says and I and and something happens and I'll just start speaking what I see and then after a while it'll leave before me and maybe right along here sets the woman. He sees in the vision a little girl. He sees a life and the life begins to he explain that brother Biscll. I can't explain it. You can't explain it. He couldn't explain it. God is the author of life. &gt;&gt; So he sees a life and it starts to materialize. He sees a little girl and then something happens. Then he begins to speak what's happening. what he sees taking place. And after a while, he said, "It leaves from before me and maybe right along here sets a woman. She's done come down to this age." He saw your substance. I will read a little earlier a little later I will read where you came here by election even in the there's a natural selection &gt;&gt; the sperm of your father and the seed into which that sperm went. There was uh there was a certain election. The color of your hair, the color of your skin, the color of your eyes, all of those things were determined not by father, not by mother, by an intelligence. &gt;&gt; I say that intelligence is God. &gt;&gt; And that was a natural selection. That was a natural election that brought you here in this substance. God knew you before that ever happened. He knew you before the the the natural selection took place. And then you came here into a physical body. Your mother and father received you as a baby and dealt with you and cared for you all through life. and you had a certain name and you were raised in a certain country and all of those things. God knew all of that before it ever happened. &gt;&gt; And then somewhere along the line, God, if you were called by him, he sent a certain word or certain witness or certain testimony by your way &gt;&gt; and something smoked you inside. Said that's truth. I can't explain it but it's true. &gt;&gt; Something has spoke. Someone asked me when did you see that brother Brad Pam was Malachi 4. I can't tell you exactly. He mentioned Malachi 4. He mentioned Malachi 4 and and and and and just said and he'll turn the hearts of the fathers of the children hearts of children. I just believed it. &gt;&gt; It it was so obvious. any anything else. If anybody had tried to convince me that it was, you know, scripturally or technically or put all the scriptures together, I I would just said, "Get away from me. Just get away." I mean, this was the only thing I I said to people that were in in uh uh the upper realms of denominationalism. They they were challenging Malachi 4. Well, you've preached on Malachi 4. I said, "If I preached it about myself, it it it wouldn't bother you. It wouldn't bother you because it doesn't fit me." When he when he speaks it, people are disturbed because it fits him. Right. &gt;&gt; When the prophets gave their prophecy and the people who heard it knew they were prophets, &gt;&gt; that's why they slew them &gt;&gt; and they said things that were just out of out of reason with the age that they were living in because the prophet even the word prophet is some he's telling something ahead of time. You know, I read a statement yesterday. &gt;&gt; I read a statement yesterday. I said to my wife, I'm going to read it to you. I never heard Brother Brandham say it. You talk about prophet. He said they'll there will come insects. He's talking about judgment. He says there'll come insects that haven't hatched yet. &gt;&gt; Have you been listening to the news? &gt;&gt; Children being born because of a certain mosquito. Where was this mosquito when I was a kid? Where was this mosquito 500 years ago? There will come insects that haven't even hatched yet. &gt;&gt; And that kind of word and that kind of intelligence called you, &gt;&gt; called me. &gt;&gt; And then after he called, doesn't know what's going to happen. He knows every detail. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He knows what you've been through. &gt;&gt; He knows all about the mud and the sin. And he knows all about the religion you got stuffed with. &gt;&gt; And he in a moment of time you can People have been as stuffed with religion and with the trinity doctrine for decades and it leaves them in just a second. &gt;&gt; Who does that? God Almighty leaves them. God Almighty does that. &gt;&gt; And he saw your substance &gt;&gt; before you came in the doors. &gt;&gt; He saw your substance when you were a little girl. Saw your substance when you're a little boy. &gt;&gt; And he guided that substance until that substance come in contact with eternal life. &gt;&gt; And you received it. &gt;&gt; You received it then because you were ordained to receive it. and you were born again &gt;&gt; into another kingdom &gt;&gt; for another message &gt;&gt; and you came down to this age &gt;&gt; and you're sitting here in the seat today. You come down to this generation and I look and hear upon this I said then I'm going to look upon this congregation and these people came down to this age. Why did you come down to this age to hear what you're hearing? pay attention to what you're hearing and to declare that is a word of God to me. I'm going to embrace it. Others may not embrace it. I I am going to embrace this promise. I'm going to confess it &gt;&gt; and I'm going to possess it &gt;&gt; and I will let my life be the evidence of the unseen God. &gt;&gt; The God that spoke it. I will live that. to his glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who's preaching in Long Beach? He said, "Here, wait a minute. A woman appeared here." He just g He just explained it a moment ago. A woman appeared here before me. Somebody praying neuritis eyes. I I didn't know about your neuritis, so I googled it. Yeah. And it talks about the eyes. Here's a man with a seventh grade. The substance had seventh grade Kentucky education. &gt;&gt; It's in Long Beach, California, years later. And he says, "A woman has appeared." Where did she appear? &gt;&gt; Appeared in wherever he was. He He went even to where they were. &gt;&gt; God who is timeless would take his messenger. Tell you what, friends, and don't get me wrong, but God came down. &gt;&gt; The God that brought you here, &gt;&gt; came down to call people's names. Came down to say the the God that was in Christ. He said, "I will be in you &gt;&gt; and you will be in me &gt;&gt; and the things that I do, you'll do." We don't get it done because we don't believe it &gt;&gt; the way we ought to believe it. &gt;&gt; We We think come here and we think we come to church. You've not come here to church. You've not come here to hear somebody. I'm making an announcement to you that this God that called you, this God that ordained that you should hear this word, he's the one that's speaking to you now. It's not even this substance here. I give this substance to God himself. &gt;&gt; I prayed, God, send your word. &gt;&gt; Send your word out. You still heal. Your word is exactly the same as it was in the time of Jesus. Deliver the people. Heal the people. Perform the unseen amongst us. &gt;&gt; Can you believe it? Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; I see a little girl. I see a little man. I see a boy. and he comes on down to this age to hear this word. &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance &gt;&gt; of things hoped for, &gt;&gt; the evidence of things unseen. &gt;&gt; Your life will produce the evidence. &gt;&gt; You've been called to produce the evidence. I see a woman appeared. Somebody's praying. Neuritis eyes. The woman's got a red dress on. What's he doing? He's seeing it materialize. &gt;&gt; And something's happened. &gt;&gt; Nearitis eyes. She has a red dress on. Where is that? &gt;&gt; And the woman's sitting right here, &gt;&gt; right there in front of him. But he he's he's busy. The thing is all materializing. &gt;&gt; That realm, friends, &gt;&gt; that's not some spooky place. &gt;&gt; That's not some place that's only accessed by one man. &gt;&gt; It was accessed by him. Don't get me wrong. We're not prophets. I'm not a son of a prophet. But you are here and testifying that God spoke to you. The invisible God spoke to you. It is that invisible God's responsibility to lead you. He said, "I will not leave you. I will guide you. I will comfort you. &gt;&gt; You are the redeemed of the Lord." And the redeemed of the Lord says so. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a human name. &gt;&gt; This intelligence knows your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It said the woman's got a red dress on here. She sits right here. What happened? The vision just materialized to the present time. And the woman was sitting right there. You believe that he will heal you, Miss Curry? You believe he'll heal you? You believe he'll do what you've asked him to do, &gt;&gt; Miss Adama? &gt;&gt; Do you think he will do what he will do? You think he'll do what he'll say, &gt;&gt; Sister Clement? &gt;&gt; You believe he'll do it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe he'll do it. Brother Daniel, &gt;&gt; he knows your name. Yes, &gt;&gt; he knows your life. &gt;&gt; He comes into a message and I've spoken this many times, but maybe you didn't catch it and he starts a service with conference of God. &gt;&gt; I can tell you you could tell me a dream that you had perhaps years ago. How can you tell it? Because you lock back into your memory channel. If your memory channel can bring that, don't tell me that God by vision can't bring what he wants to bring. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he can bring it from before you were birthed, &gt;&gt; before you were conceived. &gt;&gt; And that's what he said to Jeremiah. Before you were conceived, &gt;&gt; I knew you &gt;&gt; before you came forth out of the womb. &gt;&gt; I declared you ordained you to be a prophet. &gt;&gt; And this is what will happen. &gt;&gt; Even during his prophecy, he had to say, "I'll not speak it. I make too many enemies. I'm not going to say it. But he says, "But the word burned in my bones." &gt;&gt; If you've been called here to this earth to be a witness, you can't keep quiet. &gt;&gt; Even if you live it in silence, you must live it. &gt;&gt; You will live that life because your life, you have been sent here to declare the invisible God. &gt;&gt; Do you receive that? Let me see your hands if you receive it. &gt;&gt; He says, "Then if you'll believe with all your heart, God will make you well. And if that's right, raise up your hand. There you are. I challenge you to believe it." He said, then he asked the question, "What is it? What is it? &gt;&gt; What is this quote that I've just given? What is it that was happening then? What is it that's happening now? &gt;&gt; The same Lord God Almighty. &gt;&gt; He's He's answering what it is. You may say, "What is that?" &gt;&gt; It's the Lord God Almighty. &gt;&gt; He's here &gt;&gt; and he's indwelling human flesh. And he says two words. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This invisible God is here. &gt;&gt; What is that? I see a woman. It's eyesight. It's neuritis. &gt;&gt; And I had to Google it and went on. What is neuritis? It's a disease of the eyes and it goes on long explanations. Mayo Clinic is describing it. What is it, friends? What is this message? I ask this congregation of Cloverdale Bible Way and all who may be streaming, what is this message? Why are we here? Why are you living? Why do you have substance? God saw your substance coming here? God saw you before you were conceived and knew that you'd be here. Knew that you'd have a certain job. You'd enter a certain a certain education, a certain profession, or a certain labor. God knew exactly every detail and he watched it materialize from a boy in China, Josh. And he saw it and he saw it all materialize and come on down. And if he was describing and say one day he came and he heard at a school or he heard in a service and something spoke to your heart that was this invisible God and he sent his word so that you might declare it the invisible God to someone else. &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. I can tell you if this congregation could get a hold of what I'm saying, there'd be things spontaneously happening as a prophet would say, if they would would believe it, the people, the whole congregation would be healed. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Or was he just saying that to be nice? No, he was saying that because that's the truth of God's word. and people who tried to believe it that was failing. All you have to do is just believe what was spoken. &gt;&gt; That's not hard. Don't stumble over the simplicity. &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. &gt;&gt; It won't come. It won't work by knowledge. Just say he said it. &gt;&gt; He the invisible God has declared it. &gt;&gt; And I believe that as a child I believe that. &gt;&gt; Hello folks. Hello folks. &gt;&gt; We believe. &gt;&gt; We believe. &gt;&gt; He said it. We believe it. &gt;&gt; That's how it works. &gt;&gt; What if it doesn't happen today? He still said it. &gt;&gt; And I still believe it. &gt;&gt; And if necessary, I will die in the faith saying, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let the people of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; He is worthy &gt;&gt; of all of your breath &gt;&gt; and all of your praise. &gt;&gt; All of your worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel so filled. I feel as though I'd love to if I had a thousand tongues, if I could dance, I would dance before the Lord. &gt;&gt; What a meaning. What a message. What a time. Listen to me, kids. &gt;&gt; You get on the internet or you get on with the devices that we have today. You see all kinds of things and make it so it's almost alive and see people fighting and shooting. It's a hoax, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; It's not there. &gt;&gt; In fact, it's just a lie. It's a lie cuz it's not true. Those people aren't there. Those guns aren't firing. Those bombs aren't going off. The whole thing's a hoax. Don't spend your time on a hoax when you can have all of your time in something that's so real. There is another dimension. There is another place. Hallelujah. That knows your name. You believe it, Daniel. Hallelujah. He knew the substance would come here. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let people become overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's not be Let's not be ashamed of seeing women weep &gt;&gt; and wash his feet with tears &gt;&gt; and wipe his feet with the hairs of her head. may be disturbing to a nice supper dinner.

God Almighty has told them go down stand around them. This is my redeemed. You angels are my servants but these are my redeemed. I purchased them &gt;&gt; with my own beloved son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful today. This &gt;&gt; what God saw has materialized &gt;&gt; and is here. &gt;&gt; You're here. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; The redeemer's here. The healer is here. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory to Lord. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Can I continue on just for a few moments? I've chosen several so that you can not deny it's not just one here, one there. through the scripture. God said to Jeremiah, "Before I formed in the belly, before I formed you in a belly and before you came forth out of the womb, before any of this happened, I sanctified you &gt;&gt; and ordained you a prophet to the nations. Doesn't surprise me. Not for a moment that a boy heard a boy. If he'd have seen a vision of himself, he'd have seen a boy carrying water to a whiskey still. Still his father was an alcoholic. His father was a bootleger and the boy called of God ordained to be a prophets carrying water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In two buckets. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He's not heard him yet. He's not seen him yet. &gt;&gt; But he's carrying water. Does that sound like you're a prophet? Does that sound like a ordained one of God carrying water that'll be turned into whiskey? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. as God's elected &gt;&gt; and thus a wind blew. And if he was seeing the vision, he would hear a wind and he would start to speak and say, "I see a boy." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see a tree. He's near a tree. And the wind is rustling in the leaves of the tree. &gt;&gt; And now there's a voice. And the voice spoke to the boy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. said, 'N never never drink or smoke or defile your body in any way. &gt;&gt; So when you're older, there's a work for you to do. &gt;&gt; Many years later, and then the thing would materialize. &gt;&gt; So I see him here. Here he is standing behind the pullpit. &gt;&gt; Here he is declaring the word of God. That's what the substance was ordained to do. &gt;&gt; Oh, I see you've had a lot of trouble. I've seen a lot of your friends have left you. I see you turning down a lot of money. &gt;&gt; I was ordained to do that. &gt;&gt; He told me about the check. $1.5 million because a man's wife was was healed from cancer. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Take it back." Said, "I" Well, they said, "We can't take it back. The FBI, they just needed to make sure they had the right person." And he showed him some ID and he said they he said take it back and tell him I thank him. Said we can't take it back. It's already in the bank. We're just here to make sure we have the right person and you are authorized. The money's already in your account. He says it drive me crazy. I wouldn't know what to do with it &gt;&gt; if he was seeing his own vision. You say, "I see you turning away from it." &gt;&gt; Because the gift of God can't be sold. &gt;&gt; The gift of God can't be bought. &gt;&gt; The gift of God, what is a million half dollars? It's nothing. It'll burn up in the fireplace might start a good fire, but I tell you what was in the bosom of this man will start a fire in the souls of individuals in the substance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before you were formed, said to Jeremiah, &gt;&gt; "I ordained you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In conference with God, &gt;&gt; now you'll find this one. &gt;&gt; I listen to because I I'd just been determined I was going to convey going to somehow get to these people, get what it's like, what this ministry is all about. &gt;&gt; This isn't my daddy's bigger than your daddy. has nothing to do with that. My daddy happens to be father God Almighty. &gt;&gt; We have one father. You and I have one father. And that's our father. And he's in the invisible realm. And we needed some substance down here &gt;&gt; in his extended mercy. Some substance &gt;&gt; to see visions that we could understand &gt;&gt; and speak of scripture so that we could understand it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in this conference with God, he starts out talking about doctors. He said how kind, compassionate they are. He said trying to make life better for the people. He just talks. He doesn't talk it like a minister. He just talking about doctors, how they try to make life better for the people. And then he preaches conference with God, maybe an hour, hour and a half. Then they call prayer line and the first one that comes, the first one is standing there and you have to listen very carefully, but you'll hear him say, "You believe it, doctor?" and mother too. Uh-huh. said, "You're not from this city. You're not from this country." Is down in the States someplace. You come from another place. You come from Canada. Said, "You come from Vancouver." What kind of intelligence is that? Sister Ano you nailed here. You didn't come from SFU. You didn't come from this country. You come from Africa. You come from Zimbabwe. He knew you before you were even conceived. &gt;&gt; Your name is Anno. That's just how precise it was. I know that by a human knowledge. But now here he is talking to a doctor and he's in another realm. You're not from this city. You're not from this country. You're from Canada. Uh-huh. Vancouver. Uh-huh. But he says, "But you're not from Vancouver. You're from Finland." Hello. &gt;&gt; If that man had said, "No, I'm sorry. You're wrong. I'm from Texas." &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be here preaching. &gt;&gt; If he said, "No, I'm not from I'm not from Finland. I'm from Germany." I wouldn't be here preaching. That's how honest I am. And that and he was a hundred times a thousand times more honest than that. He stayed with that vision. What that vision said is what he said. Then I begin to see something happen. Then I say I begin to speak and I begin to speak and then then then it materializes comes down the person sitting right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it, don't you, James? &gt;&gt; Sister Joy, you believe it. We believe it. &gt;&gt; You believe it, Sean. You believe it, sister. &gt;&gt; That's all. to disbelieve a sin. &gt;&gt; I say, "Well, I'm tempted with this." And it and Satan would like to come around, club you over the head. Oh, you thought these bad thoughts. You thought these things. Sorry, Satan. Sorry. You don't have any place here. You don't have any claim on me. I happen to be a believer. &gt;&gt; I may be human, but I happen to be a believer. I don't s and let those evil birds nest in my hair. &gt;&gt; We're believers. &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me shall be saved. &gt;&gt; He that believeth not is damned. &gt;&gt; What could be simpler than that? Right. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to close right away. I'm sorry. Holding it a little bit. &gt;&gt; I've got to abbreviate some things. You don't only He didn't only for me. You say, "Well, what I've been through." No, no. Let's Let's forget what you've been through. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's forgive trials and hardships. I could keep you up here for a long time and tell you things. You kids get to play in a gym. I never saw the inside of a gym. You get to go to your room. I've never had a room. Never had a room. You've moved around the country. I moved 13, 14, 15, 16, about 17 times from the time I was eight to the time I was 15. But one time it did a hunger in my heart. &gt;&gt; Just a hunger in my heart and I would read something. I'd read some scripture. I read a scripture. Can I give you this? I read a scripture, strange scripture. If you remember it while I'm talking, you can raise your hand. and was uh Abraham. And the Lord said, he said, "What seed will you give me?" And he said, "What will you give me?" And he said, "Take a she I believe it was a she a he goat or a she goat, a ram. Take a ram. Take these animals and cut them in pieces and lay them out." and the turtle dove and the birds and don't divide them and and then the horror of darkness came through and then a light came a little light came through and while I would read that I'd start to weep and I would weep till I sobbed and I thought why am I crying And tears, big tears dropped on my Bible. And I thought, why is it every time I read this, something comes over me and I weep. It's very personal. I thought, why is that? And one day while I was reading the message, years later, I was reading the message and brother Brandham refers to Abraham taking these animals out and God told him in a horror of darkness came through. He said, he said, "Well, maybe I'll just take a moment and explain that." Oh, I thought, "Please do. Please do. I want to know a part of my life." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he says God was showing Abraham redemption. &gt;&gt; He was showing him Calvary. &gt;&gt; I thought, "Oh, that's why I was weeping. &gt;&gt; That's why tears came out of my eyes and fell on my Bible. He was showing Abraham redemption. I'm going to redeem your seed. I'm going to redeem them." &gt;&gt; I was so thankful. So thankful that you have a messenger that &gt;&gt; maybe years and years ago. &gt;&gt; Brother David Laws. Brother David, you work for fitting tractor and for a time you just stand as a witness now for a few moments to the invisible God. That's why you came. That is why you're here. That's why you were put into a material substance body. that your only purpose in life is to get glory to God. &gt;&gt; This man because of difficult circumstances in his life was not able to hold a job and he had a wife sister Violet who's standing beside him or sitting beside him. Violet, would you like to stand this woman here? And they had a baby, a child. And that child, Brother David, called me one day in the church years ago. That same God is still living and is present here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said to Violet Brother David, the same one who did that. And he said, "Did I ever tell you how Brother Brandham spoke to me over the tape? Brother David had learned to be a spray painter, but he couldn't get a job. and he couldn't, he didn't have any money hardly to live on. And he said to me, he said, "I knew that a man must work and support his family." And I told God, "I can't support my family. I must not have the Holy Ghost." He walks into his house full of despair, a little wee tiny place where this couple was. This man walked in. I won't say penniles, but nearly penniless. No job, a wife and a child that he can't support. Can't get a job. He's been fired from several. Not because he was a bad worker. He was an excellent worker. He said, "I ever did I ever tell you how Brother Brown spoke to me over tape." He said, "I walked into my house full of despair." He said, "I don't know why. If I'm wrong, Brother David, you can correct me. But you said you went into a closet and you picked out a white shirt that you had used for painting and there were specks of paint on it. Is that correct? You remember that? He said, "I went into the front room and I sat down in a chair. Just sat there full of discouragement and despair. There he is. I didn't know he was going to be here this morning. I didn't know. This is unplanned." And he said, "And I and I just turned on the tape. I just flicked the tape to play. I don't don't know what tape it was. I don't know anything about the tape. I just I knew it was brother Brandham on the tape and the tape started playing and he had a healing line coming up or whatever and he's speaking from the platform and he's saying and he said another thing he said young man sitting down in that chair brother David doesn't know why he didn't sit in the sofa why he didn't sit he sat in oh like a kitchen chair and he sat in this chair with this white shirt on. And brother Brandham says, "Yes, you sitting in that chair." Yes. He said, "You with the white shirt &gt;&gt; said, you need two thing. You have two things on your heart. And one is you need a job. And the other is you wonder if you have the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; That's this man. That was the two questions on his heart. And I want you to know right after that he got a job with Finning Tractor and had it till he retired. &gt;&gt; I say this God, &gt;&gt; God saw a boy. He knew where the boy lived. He knew that boy would sit in a certain chair. He knew that he'd go into a closet and pick up a certain shirt. And that shirt, he doesn't know why he put it on, but it has that paint flex on it. Why am I putting this shirt on? God made you put that on, brother David. Because God was going to speak from another realm and say, "I know that boy." And he come down now. He sits right here in this chair and a prophet speaks to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother David, Sister Violet. I'm so thankful you're here. &gt;&gt; You're here as a witness to this invisible God. And the devil's lying to you. Don't tell him. Don't give him any credit. He's a liar. &gt;&gt; And the deliverance, this word comes with deliverance. &gt;&gt; This word comes with the power of heaven behind it. &gt;&gt; I say glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let the congregation of the Lord give him glory. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So God said through Isaiah, he's not just a character, but God said through Isaiah, so we are all as an unclean thing and of all of our righteousness is as filthy rags. And we do all we all do fade as a leaf. And our iniquities like the wind have taken us away. And there is none that calleth upon thy name. That sounds pretty pretty sad. That stirth up himself none that stirth up himself to take hold of thee. For thou has hid thy face from us and hast consumed us because of our iniquities. But now, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you saying that? But now, Lord, these things have been I've been like a leaf that's withered on a branch. I've been dry. My white righteousness is as filthy rags. Listen friends, the fact that you come to church and we do the duties of life that we're not heroes because of that. But now, oh Lord, thou art father. Thou art our father, and we are the clay. &gt;&gt; And thou our potter, not a potter. You're our potter. You're my potter. I am your clay. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you feel that way? &gt;&gt; And we all are the work of thy hands. said through Jeremiah. The vessel that had been made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter. So he made it again, another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it. Oh, I tell you friends, and the apostle Paul picked it up. Hath not the potter power over the clay, over the same lump to make something to honor, to dishonor? Doesn't he have power? &gt;&gt; I just say to the church today, hasn't the potter power over the clay? &gt;&gt; You got a disappointment? You think he's got power over the clay? &gt;&gt; Now, father, &gt;&gt; you're the potter. &gt;&gt; I'm the clay. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, father, &gt;&gt; you saw it wasn't my mother and dad that decided determined to have a child. They didn't know I'd be a boy or a girl. But God did. &gt;&gt; And sent a prophet, I see a little girl. I see a child. I see a life materializing. &gt;&gt; God saw your life. Oh, if I could get sit down with you face to face and tell you God saw your life when it was materializing before father knew mother knew anything about it. God saw the life materializing &gt;&gt; and then it came on down. Then he saw a little girl. What did God do, friends? What did God do? God gave you a personal messenger &gt;&gt; to explain how he sees things. &gt;&gt; This is how God sees things. I have had a personal messenger sent from God to tell me even how I got here. [Applause] friends, don't ever declare yourself to having been, well, I'm this I'm I'm of this clan or of this group or of this organization or this country or we we're strangers. That's right. &gt;&gt; And pilgrims, &gt;&gt; we don't belong here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're from another kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're from another place. &gt;&gt; Listen to me now. This messenger, this personal messenger has told you and I, he said, "This has not been done. I have it here, but I haven't come. This has not been done for 2,000 years. He said the He said the Old Testament was the husband &gt;&gt; and the saints back there fulfilled that. And he says the bride will fulfill the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the New Testament ends with amen at the end of Revelation. &gt;&gt; And the New Testament says, "Come to the seventh messenger. I'll show you the brow. I'll show you the lamb's wife. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's a promise for us to embrace. &gt;&gt; I'm part of that &gt;&gt; and I confess it and I hold to it and I see that promise maybe a far off. That's my promise. That's why I came here in substance to give glory. Who spoke that? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we want to sing some praise and worship to you. We praise you. We pray you'll receive our praise and thanksgiving as the people have received your word. Send forth your word, oh God. You will do so. The word is gone. You will heal and deliver and shackles will fall. &gt;&gt; People's minds will be renewed. &gt;&gt; You'll take away, oh God, all the dullness &gt;&gt; and all the weariness of this life. you'll take it away. Let it dissipate, oh God. And to those that are streaming, I feel just now to call and pray for them. I pray that you will do something in a very special manner. Do something. Oh God, let our minds of the people here remain focused. Oh father, but those that are in need. You will even send your word. You see the wounded ones and you see the healed ones and you see the rejoicing ones. Oh God, receive glory and the and the promises we embrace. You have said we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; That is our promise. You have said that. We have heard it many times. But you have spoken it and it shall materialize. [Music] Glory, glory, hallelujah. [Music] I'm a new creation. Brother Brian, let's stand. [Music] If you believe experiences, &gt;&gt; sing it as a redeemed. [Music] Oh, I thank God he justify me by his we [Music] &gt;&gt; more than a storm now. More than a song. Maybe a decoration. I've been born. Look back and think about the time [Music] of a song. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. I'm a new creation. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man, brand new woman, brand new pass away. I born again more than a coner. [Music] You know there's a lot of people didn't rejoice even when the prophet himself even when Jesus himself it's not what's being said it's what's being believed. [Music] The prophet himself said, "Miss Curry calls another woman, said she's missing it." &gt;&gt; And then he finally said, "She's missed it. &gt;&gt; That's not us. &gt;&gt; That's not for That's not why I preach. I preach that you'll get it. &gt;&gt; Make it so real till you'll get it. &gt;&gt; This word's for me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is alive and he's here present. I've heard it before, but it's different now. He's here, present. You're here. I'm embracing you with the promise. I'm embracing the promise. Hallelujah. I love the promise. You love it, brother David. Hallelujah. [Music] What are these people? I see a boy. I see a life and it materializes. You want that quote. It materializes. I see a girl. Something happens. She's wearing a red dress. Oh, here she is right here. Say, "That sounds mystic." That's exactly. He said, "And the people of God live in a place alone with God and they're mystics to the world." And I say, "Glory to God." Hallelujah. I want I don't want this old world fictitious and bony as can be. You talk about gloss and a bunch of Hollywood and nonsense. And we don't want to be swept away with just emotionalism in a in a glorified Hollywood presentation. That's not what it is. This is oldfashioned gospel. This is the oldfashioned Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This may not be the popular way, but this is the way. &gt;&gt; He is the way, the truth, and he was rejected. We may be rejected, but that doesn't change anything. Are you with me while I continue to preach? &gt;&gt; That's why I say hallelujah. [Music] He saw you &gt;&gt; before you came before you came here. Brother Gilbert, you came here for this purpose. [Music] You out there, each of you, he knows exactly your name. I say you're coming down. You come right down to this age. &gt;&gt; He ordained that you would be here &gt;&gt; in this service &gt;&gt; to hear these things &gt;&gt; and to go out of this building transformed by the transforming power. The scripture, &gt;&gt; the Bible, the words of God, they have a certain imbred characteristic in them to cause you to believe. &gt;&gt; It will cause you to believe. &gt;&gt; This kind of preaching should make anybody believe. &gt;&gt; If this congregation believes, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He'll move every demon power. He'll move every government. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll move every situation and institution to his glory and his will. To God be the glory. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; I just the just couple things on my mind. I want to sing with you. Sometime I don't sing because of you. I sing because of me. It's not being selfish, but I just want to sing. I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Tell the world I'm one of them. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're not whimpers. We didn't we we we didn't come here to whimper. &gt;&gt; We came here to glorify God. There's no device that's formed against thee that shall prosper. Do you believe it? There's no device. There's no economic device. There's no work device. There's nothing. There's no device. Satan has not got an invention that can suck you in. In fact, I have an invention that from God that will break every feather. We have a Holy Spirit within. We have a secret power to break every fatter. &gt;&gt; Fact is, I have it right here. The prophets in Chicago, many people have come around the front. He speaks such a rebuke. If he spoke that in this church, it would hurt us. He spoke such a rebuke. He said, "What's the matter with you Pentecostal people?" said, "Shame on you." &gt;&gt; Because of the things that happened, he was calling out the people. Called out many, many, many. Just couldn't hardly get them out fast enough. And he called the people forward to repent. And ministers came and so on so forth. But he said, he said, "You may see me. I draw my hands back and then I put them out forward and lay lay my hands on the people." He said, "I'm doing that because he said visions are breaking out all over the congregation and healings and supernatural things are taking place." And when I see it taking place out there, I lay my hands on these people that they might partake of the same thing. I say, "Glory be to God." Thank God for that insight. There's faith out there. &gt;&gt; There's faith out there. There's faith down here. We come to church to see things happen, friends. &gt;&gt; Not just to hear preaching, but things happen for you. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Let the Hallelujah roll.

God created this substance for that purpose. &gt;&gt; God created your substance. &gt;&gt; You that are here in the platform, he created our substance for that very purpose. Brother Tom, why don't you ask a blessing upon the people? &gt;&gt; Amen. Next Sunday, there's no service here in the morning, &gt;&gt; right?

Heavenly Father, what can we say this morning but how much we love your word. &gt;&gt; Word has come alive to us Lord and heaven has come down. Our spirits have been just thrilled Lord to hear thus sayaith the word of God. to thank Lord that we have finally found out. Hebrews 1, Hebrews 11:1, by faith this substance has been declared. &gt;&gt; Before Lord, it was even in our mothers and our father's minds. We were found in the mind of God. And sub faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. And Lord, we heard we could hear about Abraham. We could hear about Moses by faith and Noah by faith. But the wonderful part, Lord, that they without us are not made perfect. &gt;&gt; The New Testament &gt;&gt; without that Old Testament, the New Testament without us, they are not made perfect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God, may the faith of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Lord, be our faith this morning. &gt;&gt; Our faith is raised up to another realm. and we're thankful for it. Strengthen your servant. May this word become alive to each and every one of us realizing we have a part to play. And so, Lord, our hearts are indeed thrilled. And would you go with us? May the presence of God surround us. May this word of God come alive to us. And Lord, as the pastor is saying just at the end, it's just not what's being said and people not hearing. It's the people believing. And we want to say we are the believers that are believing by faith. Go with us now Lord under this blessing in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you saints. Come with this presence. Bring the Lord Jesus Christ with you. We'll have a wonderful time one more time. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Heat. Heat. N. [Music] Heat.
