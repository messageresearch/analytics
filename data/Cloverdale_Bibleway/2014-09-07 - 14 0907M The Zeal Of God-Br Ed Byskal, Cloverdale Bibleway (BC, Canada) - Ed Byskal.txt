Brother Dave Chabernoff, if you'd [music] come, there's several requests that we want to pray over, but you've got to reach out and touch the Lord right where you're at. many needs in the congregation [music] this morning. But I believe that God has a heart. God has a mind for you, for this [music] body, for this service this morning, for our pastor. So we want to come under one mind, one heart, [music] one accord. We want to remember the straws family. Their daughter's in very serious condition in an accident down in Oregon. She's in ICU. We want to remember her this morning. [music] Unspoken requests we want to lift before the Lord this morning. We just want God to move in our midst. How many have a need upon [music] your heart? You just say, "Lord, with my burden lifted up before you would to [music] come and meet me this morning as we pray." Brother Dave, God bless you. Let's pray seats. Our precious heavenly father, Lord, we bow our heads to you, Lord, in one mind, one accord this morning.

But we're following the revealed word of the hour, Lord. &gt;&gt; This is the ark, Lord. [music] This is the ark for this hour, Father. And we've climbed inside it, Lord, and we're resting on it, Lord. We're feeling completely safe, completely content under thus sayaeth the Lord this morning.

And Lord, this morning as we've already prayed, we are praying for brother Michael Andes and brother Ryan Hayes, far away in Malawi, but yet they're not far away from our hearts. Oh God, we pray the same spirit. Although it's evening time there, bless the word, oh God. And as Michael speaks, I pray you'll cause words to be spoken, Lord, and &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uttered from his mouth, oh God. And may they know, Father, that brother, brother brother Ryan and brother Michael are being held up in prayer and being surrounded by prayer. We pray you'll make them an eternal blessing. Oh God, may something be done for the kingdom of God in your name raised up. We thank you, Father, for the guests that are here. Brother Jean Manassi's [music] family. And we hear Lord that brother Jean Commandis family wife and four children [music] have arrived in Canada to be with him. We pray oh God that he will rejoice in you and give you glory today. I know that he is. Pray especially Father for the word this morning for the people that have gathered see the church full and to know that there are those oh God that are streaming elsewhere. And Lord, I pray that you will bless the bride of Jesus Christ [music] throughout the world. Oh God, those bloodbought children of God. You've [music] paid the supreme price for them. And today, Lord, give us divine understanding. [music] &gt;&gt; Give us, I pray, the gift of understanding and knowledge, oh God, in the things of God. Help us to see the day that we're in. I ask father for special [music] help by the Holy Spirit that you will take control of the mouth of the speaker and Lord I pray you'll take control of the ears of the hearer and that you will take control of each one of our minds and spirits Lord and bring it under the management of the Holy Spirit. And I pray oh God you will come now to our soul that channel oh God may it be filled with faith to receive every word of God in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'll invite you to take your Bible and [music] come directly to the word. I'm reading out of Isaiah. I will read two places in the Bible that don't seem to fit together, but they will during the service. I'd like to make a comment while you're looking. And if you'll be listening very very carefully, something that I've pondered very much and I decided I would just like to make these three comments. the pattern of events that follow or take place within the body of believers. I'm talking about message believers. The pattern of the events that follow or take place within the body of believers of this message are in many cases in many cases identical to those experienced in the life of Jesus Christ when he was here on earth. &gt;&gt; That's number one. This is confirming that this message is the life of Jesus Christ being lived out in another form &gt;&gt; in the corporate body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's number two. And it is the very same Lord Jesus Christ present here this morning now here in another form and in another season fulfilling perfectly Luke 17:30 in the day when the son of man is revealed because he is perhaps still revealing himself to some or revealing himself in a greater way to others. And and I'd like to say to you this morning, sometimes he is revealing himself when you aren't even aware of it. &gt;&gt; You think you're in church for Sunday morning service, but the the Lord Jesus Christ is intent on revealing himself to you. &gt;&gt; That's his purpose. And so with that, I want to address the congregation and those that are streaming. And there may be some streaming that are doubters or rejectors. I have a word for them also. I believe it's a word from God. Certainly a word from his prophet. May God bless his word. And we will read now from Isaiah 9 and we'll start at verse 6 down through verse 8. [clears throat] Familiar scripture. For unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace. Of the increase of his government and peace, there shall be no end. upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. &gt;&gt; The Lord sent a word into Jacob. Notice sent a word into Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel. I'll read a second scripture which is in Matthew the 26th chapter and verse 6 [clears throat] down to 11. Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he sat at meat. And when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, "To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor." When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, "Why trouble ye the woman? For she hath wrought a good work upon me, for ye have the poor always with you. But me, you have not always." He's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. But in this case and in many instances in your case, me, you have not always at that moment or for that season or for that moment in time which she was seizing me. You have not always. So we'll ask God to bless his word. Heavenly Father, we ask you to take these words now and break it to us in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he might be glorified. Amen. You may be seated. [clears throat] So the zeal of the Lord shall perform this. Although God did not give all the details through Isaiah of how he will perform this. Nevertheless, he said that the Lord of hosts, he will perform this. the zeal, the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this. It's uh it's important that we understand and I may be reaching out here this morning. Uh I've I've hesitated. I've really wondered about this, but I if God gives me grace and gives you grace to understand I understand I I realize we're speaking to a mixed multitude and perhaps many on the internet that are not under the full atmosphere of the service, but uh I I hope and I trust and pray that I will not be misunderstood. But the zeal of God to bring forth Jesus Christ. The redeemer is absolutely indescribable. It's completely indescribable. The zeal, the word zeal actually involves jealousy. That's one of the first uh meanings of the word. the the the zeal is the aror or passion. Uh it is love or fervor and it is referred to as one of the one of the things right in its own meaning in the in the scriptures is the jealousy or disposition of a husband. The reason why they couldn't understand Jesus Christ is because there are aspects of his message which just didn't have to do with living and love one another and those kind of things. But he was speaking from the disposition or from the position of a husband that they could not understand. The reason why people couldn't understand William Brham was because he's a prophet speaking thus sayaeth the Lord which now is the seed of God. &gt;&gt; And when you're dealing with the seed, there happens to be a certain level of jealousy. As Apostle Paul said to the Corinthian church, I'm jealous over you &gt;&gt; with a godly jealousy. &gt;&gt; For I have espoused you. I've given you an engagement to one husband, but I fear lest as the serpent beguiled Eve, so your mind should be corrupted. You understand? It has to do with the passage of seed. It has to do with one one who is giving it &gt;&gt; and and others who are receiving it. And then you'll understand things that the prophet of God spoke in this generation in a much different and greater way. I do believe so. Zeal is directly associated with the jealous dispossession of a husband. God forming a prophet vessel. God forming a prophet vessel to bring thus sayeth the Lord. He he prepared certain vessels. We call them prophets. For they said thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Who is that? That's that's a man saying thus sayaith the Lord. Not thus sayith Isaiah or thus sayith Jeremiah or thus sayith William Brandon. Thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we are we got that? And the scripture tells us that the word is the seed. It's the seed. It's God's seed. Let's just go back to the beginning very moment for just a moment quickly. And I I I don't want to labor this too terribly much. And yet I want to convey this thought before we move forward. In the beginning, God said, "And God spoke and it was so." And God spoke and it was so. And he created man and uh and and he gave man his word. And he said, "Now about these trees, you can partake of this, but you can't partake of this one." And it was that very word that Satan through the serpent came to because he always wants to get to the source of the seed. &gt;&gt; And when he was able to twist her mind around concerning the further enlightenment, &gt;&gt; uh what was the next thing that happened? became an experience that we all have participated in in that we've been born through a sexual birth and by that we die. Every person in here is dying at different levels, at different times, at different seasons. We're we are we are on our road to die. Says it's appointed under man once to die and after this the judgment. So, we know that. And then there are those that are going to be raptured, defying death. &gt;&gt; God putting it in the face of Satan. I defy you. &gt;&gt; You started this on the wrong course. I'm correcting it and putting IT ON THE RIGHT COURSE. &gt;&gt; And the only way you could do that is to bring a redeemer &gt;&gt; of the seed of God, the beginning of a new creation. And thus, GOD WAS JEALOUS. I WILL READ some scripture. jealous over Zion, jealous to bring forth his word. That's why each OF THE PROPHETS CAME IN THE jealousy of the of of God because they were carrying the seed of God, searching out to find uh a womb to put that seed in. &gt;&gt; If you don't understand it, don't take me wrong. So the zeal of the Lord performed to fulfill. Unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given. That's what it's talking about. The zeal of the Lord will perform this. The zeal of the Lord will bring forth this child, this son. This will be the seed of God. This will be the redeemer of the mankind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in the scripture which we read in in Isaiah, it starts out with for unto us a child is born. But then in this in those two verses, it says of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it. And the prophet of God tells us very clearly many times that upon the throne of David, he comes to the throne of David in the millennium. So we are somewhere between unto us a son is given. &gt;&gt; A child is born that took place. Mary the virgin brought forth that son, the seed of the woman. &gt;&gt; But and we are somewhere between that because in the millennium he will be on a throne of David. SO WE ARE VERY CLOSE to that. &gt;&gt; WE'RE VERY CLOSE. THAT IS WHY FRIENDS, THE COUNTRY, the nation that God called and brought forth out of Abraham and brought out of bondage by Moses and and sits over there in this in a nation called Israel. That is why there's so much trouble on the news every day STRUGGLING ALWAYS constantly giving up land or giving up inheritance or fighting over their inheritance or fighting over their existence. What other nation is there that is threatened by hundreds of millions of people to be driven into the sea to be made extinct so THAT YOU DON'T EXIST ANYMORE? Would you want that as Canadians or as Germans or as British or what other nation or as Americans WOULD YOU WANT SOMEBODY THREATENING ON YOUR VERY SHORES? We're going to drive you into the ocean. WE'RE GOING TO DRIVE YOU INTO NON-EXISTENCE. we're going to drive you into annihilation. They live under that threat. &gt;&gt; Why do they live under that threat? IT'S BECAUSE GOD HAS BROUGHT THEM FORTH BY A PROMISE. AND WE'RE NOT WE DON'T STAND for everything Israel stands for. Far be it. But there are some that are in that nation that are ELECTED TO RECEIVE THIS CHRIST. And they WILL SAY ONE DAY, THEY WILL SAY ONE DAY, "WHERE DID YOU GET THE WOUNDS?" in the house of my FRIENDS AND THEN THEY WILL have a revelation. Oh, he was the one that was crucified. HE IS THE SON. HE IS THE redeemer of Israel. He is the Messiah. Oh, MY FRIENDS, WE'RE RIGHT ON THE VERGE of that. &gt;&gt; So, HE'S NOT SITTING ON THE THRONE. AND THE PROPHET of God tells us uh he said it's not it's not the David that was king of Israel. It's not him. I'll read it probably a little bit later. And he said, "And it's not uh it's not Jesus. It's not Jesus as he was here on earth, but it is him that will as a son of David will sit on the throne. Sit on the throne of David his father. It was the seal of God in the people of the Old Testament. You see the the the the bringing forth of Jesus Christ unto us a son was is born. We we may say and there's a many that perhaps uh within religious world that attribute everything to Mary. The virgin wasn't just Mary. God was forming up this son way back. &gt;&gt; Uh when he promised Abraham for a son, he wasn't thinking of Isaac. He was thinking of Christ. &gt;&gt; And he chose one man that would be called the father of the faith because God himself was determined to be A FATHER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE CRIED OUT THROUGH ISAIAH ALSO, "WHERE'S MY FAMILY? WHERE'S MY HOUSEHOLD?" BECAUSE THIS IS THIS HAS BEEN IN HIS MIND. HEY, HE WANTS CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND THIS SON THAT HE'S GOING TO bring forth is going to be THE REDEEMER OF THE ENTIRE EARTH. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO REDEEM THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Is it all right thus far? &gt;&gt; We're just laying a bit of a foundation here. So the zeal of the God, the zeal of God in the people of the Old Testament, don't worry, we'll get down to your address in a few minutes that brought forth Jesus Christ. The coming and the birth of Jesus Christ involved many. It was not an isolated or singular event that just happened between Mary and and an angel and so on. That was the climax or the culmination of of all of this process all down. The Bible says, "And God formed man out of the dust of the earth." What did he do it in 24 hours or did he do it IN 24 YEARS? WE DON'T KNOW HOW long it took. It took centuries for God to form Jesus out of the old through the Old Testament. But it was through a series of people THAT WENT FROM FAITH TO FAITH to faith to faith. I WILL SAY FROM ELECTED TO ELECTED to elected to elected. IT WAS ALWAYS A PROCESS OF BRINGING HIM FORTH. AND THE PROPHET COMES IN THIS DAYS AND SAYS THERE'S MATTHEW uh I'm sorry there's uh there's uh Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, the four corners of the statue of the Lord Jesus Christ, the masterpiece that he was forming and bringing forth. AND ALL THE PROPHETS spoke uh thus sayaith the Lord and tried TO BRING ISRAEL BACK to their PROMISES AND BACK TO God and and and they BE WENT INTO IDOLATRY and went into bondage AND EVERYTHING. BUT GOD NEVER CHANGED HIS MIND. &gt;&gt; I'm still going to use them. He never SAID, "WELL, I'LL WIPE you off the face of the map and I'll start with another nation." NO, HE NEVER DID. GOD GOD KEPT IT. HE HE'S HE'S got a onetrack mind. I MAKE A PROMISE AND THAT'S IT. DO &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT? &gt;&gt; I MAKE A PROMISE AND THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BLESS I'M GOING TO BLESS THOSE THAT BLESS ABRAHAM. THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BLESS THIS MESSAGE AND THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO, he's going to bring forth and many were involved with this. Many down through time were connected directly or indirectly the zeal of God bringing forth his son passing his word seed from generation to generation from believing heart to believing heart. Believers have always been connected with bringing forth Jesus Christ in the Old Testament. And remember now that was just a shadow. And the Bible is filled with record of people from vastly different backgrounds from different races from different levels of society. See, because we've got a mixed multitude here of people and levels of life. Some perhaps, you know, are well educated, others are poorly educated. it and it doesn't make any difference. And I'm saying that because because of the we have young, we have seniors, we have married, we have unmarried, we have different races and different ethnic groups. That has nothing to do with it. You are here. God has allowed you to come. God has allowed you to come to the earth. You've come BY A NATURAL BIRTH. God knows that. And God had in his mind another birth called a new birth. &gt;&gt; God had another SEED &gt;&gt; IN HIS MIND. And he realized also that man, we all have come from a male seed into a woman's womb. And we were born at a certain time, at a certain season, and this is our season. I want to speak for a moment quickly on the zeal that brought forth a person or people to carry the faith seed. Some were ordained to give the seed &gt;&gt; and others were ordained to carry the seed. Right? &gt;&gt; Jesus was ordained and sent. For God so loved the world, he sent his only begotten son. &gt;&gt; And when he came, he was declared to be the seed of God. &gt;&gt; He was declared to be the beginning of a new creation. &gt;&gt; If he's the beginning of the new creation, HE HAS TO BE THAT DIRECT SEED of God. &gt;&gt; And the PROPHET SAID HOW IT HAPPENED. HE DESCRIBED it very clearly. HE SAID THE WORDS OF THOSE PROPHETS, &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T ISAIAH, JEREMIAH, PSALMS, and so on. IT WAS THEY WERE ELECTED OR ORDAINED TO SAY CERTAIN THINGS THAT spoke of Christ. And and the prophet said, our prophet said that the words of those prophets, now try to imagine this. The words of those prophets anchored &gt;&gt; in the womb of Mary &gt;&gt; when she believed, "Let it be unto me according to THY WORD." AND THAT WAS IT. &gt;&gt; That was it. the seed germatized AND WAS CONCEIVED WITHOUT A MAN. &gt;&gt; GOD ALMIGHTY HIMSELF, THE HOLY GHOST shall overshadow thee. IF THE HOLY GHOST OVERSHADOWED A A A YOUNG GIRL, virgin girl, WHAT WILL THE HOLY GHOST DO TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME UNDER THIS MESSAGE? WHAT WILL THE HOLY GHOST DO WHEN HE HOVERS over the people of THIS MESSAGE? I TELL YOU WHAT, FRIENDS, THE THINGS OF LIFE BECOME STRANGELY DIM WHEN WE REALIZE, FULLY REALIZE AND give honor to why God HAS DONE WHAT HE'S DONE. &gt;&gt; And I'm not here to play little picnic games or to, you know, to speak lightly. I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT SUBSTANCE OF THE WORD of God. THIS MESSAGE HAS INCREDIBLE SUBSTANCE. And if THIS WERE MY LAST MESSAGE, I WOULD WANT TO CONVEY IT TO YOU IN ALL THE POWER AND ENERGY OF THE HOLY GHOST to drive it down into your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophets were ordained to pass the seed. Surely the Lord God will do nothing, &gt;&gt; but he revealth his secret unto his servants, the prophets. The word OF THE LORD CAME unto the prophet. How many times it says that in the scripture and the now I want to just divert for a moment and speak of the zeal of God in Abraham to believe against all odds. FOR WHAT SHALL WE SAY? APOSTLE Paul says for what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh have found? What shall we say &gt;&gt; about Abraham? What did he find sir? says, "Who against hope?" &gt;&gt; He believed in hope that he would become the father of many nations. According to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHO AGAINST HOPE BELIEVED IN HOPE. When he heard those words spoken to him, WHAT LANGUAGE WAS IT SPOKEN? I DON'T KNOW, BUT those words were spoken. SO SHALL THY SEED BE. And Abraham said, "Our father in the faith," he said, "So be it." &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW. I DON'T KNOW WHEN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BUT I KNOW ONE THING. I HEARD the voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. WE MAY NOT KNOW WHEN. WE MAY NOT KNOW HOW. WE MAY NOT KNOW HOW THE ATOMS ARE GOING TO BE CHANGED. WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO IN A RAPTURE. BUT WE KNOW IT HAS BEEN SPOKEN. AND SO SHALL IT BE. Is it right? &gt;&gt; Does your faith say that? &gt;&gt; Are you a child of Abraham &gt;&gt; who against hope believed in hope in the message Israel in the church prophet God said then he brought his seed down. So now we're watching and we're just going moving through the Old Testament quickly. The next thing he comes down through Abraham and then through Isaac and then through Jacob. And I underlined. I would have had it for you on the screen, but just accept my words for it. And then through Jacob. And then through Jacob to Joseph. Look, he said, "Election is in Abraham." Did you notice just those four patriarchs? And then it ceased, broke up, went out, went out in the 12 patriarchs, and the tribes tribed off. Never did return again till it returned in one, &gt;&gt; the seed of Abraham. Then it came or come into the human being, which is Christ. &gt;&gt; It all broke off. THEN IT ALL ASSEMBLED BACK into one. Jesus Christ. Unto us a son was given and he said was glorified here on earth and lifted up unto God. And the Holy Ghost came back to spread the whole nations to fill the earth with knowledge of the Lord as deep as the heavens. And oh, that's the Holy Spirit today. &gt;&gt; I think of a number of others and I'm not going to go into it because I could preach a whole sermon on each of them. Uh I think of you've heard me preach on Tamar. She was compelled by the zeal of God to do things that she never dreamed she would do. She Tamar the daughter-in-law of of Judah and dressed herself in widowhood after two sons died. And he said go back to your father your father's house. And she dressed herself in the dress garments of widowhood. Notice the difference of garments. and she dressed herself in a garment of widowhood. Heard later that he was with his friend up shearing sheep and so near her town. So she dressed herself now in a garment of harlotry. And as a harlot sat by the roadside and and uh Judas saw her and asked now what was in his mind and what was in her mind were two totally different things. and he asked that he might have a relationship with her. And she asks him to give her uh to give her some some uh evidence of of the gift. He said, "I'll give you a kid uh little goat. I'll give you a kid for this uh service." And uh and she said, "Well, give me how do I know you'll come back?" He gave her, I think, a a signate and a rod or whatever more. gave two or three items and uh and then he goes to his friend and says, "Take this kid back to the harlot in the village." And he goes back and talks to the people cuz he can't find her. Talks to the men of the village and says, "Uh, where is the harlot that sits by the wayside?" Said, "No, there's no harlot in this village. There's no harlot here." So he goes back to Judah and says, "There's no harlot." REMEMBER NOW, JUDAH, &gt;&gt; RIGHT, &gt;&gt; IS carrying a seed. &gt;&gt; There had to be one. THERE WAS ONE COMING. &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE THE the lion [clears throat] OF THE TRIBE of Judah. &gt;&gt; Which would be none OTHER THAN JESUS CHRIST. HE HAD TO COME. BUT IT LOOKED AS THOUGH BY THE DEATH OF TWO MEN FROM JUDAH, HIS SONS, that this that this was going to be broken and it was going to end right here. IT MUST NOT END &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FULFILLMENT OF THE SCRIPTURE MUST HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; AND SO SOMETHING POSSESSES HER AND DRIVES HER TO DO SOMETHING WHICH NO WOMAN would do. SHE WASN'T WANTING A SEXUAL EXPERIENCE. SHE WASN'T EVEN WANTING A MAN. SHE WASN'T WANTING A HUSBAND. SHE WAS WANTING THAT SEED. &gt;&gt; I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. WHEN YOU SIT HERE AND YOU WANT THE WORD OF GOD THAT BAD, &gt;&gt; YOU'LL FIND THAT COMING TO CHURCH ON A SUNDAY MORNING IS JUST INFATISMAL. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOTHING. SAY, I DRIVE QUITE A DISTANCE OR WE HAVE A LONG SERVICE. NONSENSE. THIS WOMAN WHO WAS A WIDOW PUT ON THE GARMENT OF HARLOTRY &gt;&gt; TO GET THAT SEED. &gt;&gt; She didn't EVEN KNOW WHAT'S DRIVING HER. SOMETHING'S DRIVING HER, COMPELLING HER. &gt;&gt; SHE KNEW SHE WAS UNDER THE THREAT OF BEING BURNT TO DEATH. &gt;&gt; FOR SUCH AN ACT, &gt;&gt; AND SHE RISKED EVERYTHING, INCLUDING HER OWN LIFE. WELL, I have to move on. I'm talking about, YOU SAY, WHAT CAUSED HER TO DO THAT? THE ZEAL of God. &gt;&gt; She didn't have it within herself. The zeal of God. YOU LOOK BACK INTO EACH OF OUR LIVES, YOU'LL FIND THAT WE DID SOME PRETTY STRANGE STUFF. We may made some very, VERY UNPOPULAR uh decisions in life. BUT WE TOOK A STAND AND GOD CAME BEHIND IT AND STOOD BY THAT STAND. &gt;&gt; WE'VE LEFT HOME. WE LEFT FRIENDS. WE LEFT FAMILY, LEFT MOTHERS AND FATHERS. SOME OF YOU, I KNOW I'M SPEAKING TO YOU. I KNOW WHAT SOME HAVE GONE THROUGH. I KNOW THAT SOME HAVE BEEN SAID, UH, GO TO THE PSYCHIATRIST. YOU HAVE LOST YOUR MIND. NO, THEY JUST GOT THEIR MIND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Rejoice with me, friends, if you would. I think of the hot zeal of Moses. Moses. Moses, &gt;&gt; right in line to step into the Pharaoh's throne. And now he's wandering in the wilderness as a smelly shepherd and leads all of these complaining people out for 40 years. 40 years. EVEN SAYS TO GOD, YOU ASK ME TO TAKE THESE PEOPLE. HOW CAN I CARRY THESE PEOPLE? AM I A FATHER? HAVE I BROUGHT THESE PEOPLE FORTH THAT I SHOULD CARRY THEM IN MY BOSOM? He said, if you don't go before us, if you don't go before us, don't lead us up. &gt;&gt; If this angel OF THE LORD DOESN'T lead us in this message, if it's not you leading us, don't let don't carry us up any further. WE MUST HAVE HIM. &gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO ENERGIZE THIS CONGREGATION. WE MUST HAVE HIM. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT HIM, THIS IS AN EMPTY FORM. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT HIM, THIS IS JUST A GATHERING of people. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to enjoy one another's company. &gt;&gt; If we don't have him. And Moses, the zeal of God was driving him. And he went through all of the difficulties leading the people, but he did bring forth a people that became a nation. And finally, there was a people that could be called out of God known as the children of God, the children of Israel. For the first time, Moses moved it forward. There would be a people that would be that. Then we have others like Rahab and and Ruth. She was both a of a strange race and reduced to utter poverty. MOSES WAS AT THE TOP OF THE RICHEST AND MOST POWERFUL superpower on earth. This woman now she's at the bottom of the ladder. &gt;&gt; She's a she's a widow. &gt;&gt; HAS NEVER HAD A CHILD AND SHE'S OF the wrong race. She's of a race that's had its beginnings with incest. &gt;&gt; Nothing to boast about. A &gt;&gt; Moabite. &gt;&gt; Friends, you may have some I want I I want to stir your minds to think. And she was of a strange race and reduced to poverty. Yet Boaz neither despised her poverty nor her birth. If Ruth had not left her father's household and his kindred and her country, she would not have attained to the union with Boaz. We too having forsaken the creeds and the traditions and all the customs of our FATHERS WHO WALKED IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR DAY. WE'RE NOT DEGRADING THEM. We're not diminishing them. BUT WE HAVE LEFT FROM THAT. WE HAVE ANOTHER MESSAGE that has come from God. WE HAVE A THUS SAYAITH THE LORD, A VINDICATED WORD. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO US? WHAT does it mean to us? Oh, it means everything. &gt;&gt; You're all my breath. YOU'RE MY YOU'RE MY SUNSHINE. YOU'RE MORE THAN LIFE TO ME. &gt;&gt; And because Ruth forsook all, she became the mother of kings, even as the church did likewise for her David himself. from D from her David himself sprung. You might say, "WHAT AM I DOING HERE ON A SUNDAY morning listening to this?" You have I'm announcing TO YOU. YOU HAVE BELIEVED A MESSAGE THAT'S going to BRING FORTH THE SON OF DAVID TO SIT ON A THRONE. &gt;&gt; You don't believe that? &gt;&gt; That is according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Ruth brought forth Oed brought forth Jesse brought forth David. Ruth did perfect type of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There came unto him a woman. Now he's born and he's here on earth and I've moved quickly as I as quickly as I possibly can. And there came a woman having an alabaster box, very precious ointment, and poured on his head as he sat at meat. And when the disciples saw it, they had indignation. They were very provoked. They were filled with indignation. And another scripture tells us it was Judas. He probably had the most indignation because he was the he was the treasurer and the keeper of the funds for the group of Jesus. And they were saying to what purpose is this waste? Think of this act. This woman is going to anoint him for his burial and they have identified it as a waste. &gt;&gt; How far off believers can be. Sometimes perhaps you've OBSERVED THINGS AND YOU THINK, "OH, THE MINISTRY DID THIS AND THE MINISTRY SAID THAT." LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE WHAT THE MINISTRY IS doing or saying. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're compelled &gt;&gt; TO DO A CERTAIN THING. I don't say everything the ministry does is correct, &gt;&gt; but I'm SAYING THAT WE'RE UNDER A DIFFERENT THIS ISN'T JUST PREACHERS OF ANOTHER CHURCH. We're under a different KIND OF BAND-AID. &gt;&gt; WE STUDY A DIFFERENT KIND OF WORD. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY OF THE SCRIPTURE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING WORD. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT, YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING HERE. &gt;&gt; You must believe that &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A DIFFERENT MESSAGE. WE'RE UNDER DIFFERENT OES. WE'RE UNDER A DIFFERENT LIGHT. WE'RE UNDER A DIFFERENT VINDICATION. &gt;&gt; I didn't intend on saying that, but it's free. And this OINTMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR MUCH and given to the poor. And when Jesus understood it, he said unto them, and this is burning in my heart for many days now, why trouble ye the woman? for sheath has brought a good work upon me. For you have the poor always with you. But me, me, even though it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, but me. At this this moment, you don't have always. You'll look back perhaps in future days say, "Oh, if I had only hear that again. Oh, if I'd only known what was really happening. Oh, if I'd only been listening. Oh, if I'd only given my best. Oh, if I had just strained at it as a as a people." as I see those and I heard about heard brother Ed talking about the women and the men of the old the Joshua and the Calebs and I heard the brothers preach about it and my heart was so stirred let it be more than stirred friends &gt;&gt; even this morning &gt;&gt; me you don't have always you're listening close me who he was referring to was a moving object. Me was soon going to be me was soon going to be crucif me was soon going to breathe his last breath. She couldn't COME A FEW DAYS LATER. THIS WAS ONLY ABOUT 6 DAYS BEFORE the crucifixion. SHE COULDN'T COME A FEW DAYS LATER AND SEE HIM AT THE CROSS AND SAY, "OH, IF I COULD ONLY DO IT NOW, MY ALABASTER BOX IS STILL IN THE ROOM. I'D LIKE I I LIKE TO DO IT NOW. &gt;&gt; ME, &gt;&gt; you don't ALWAYS HAVE. WHEN THAT HOLY SPIRIT SPEAKS TO YOU, HE INTENDS HE'S COMING FROM THE ETERNITY. HE INTENDS THAT YOU MOVE. HE INTENDS THAT YOU SAY, "YES, HERE I AM, LORD." &gt;&gt; What is it that you'd have me to do or say? And I know that this is for this congregation. Me, you don't always have. I'm going to come right to the heart of it right now. And I may come a little later. right in this time and brethren, right in this season in the message, this Christ, &gt;&gt; this Christ that's been revealed, &gt;&gt; THIS CHRIST THAT FINALLY CAME across the nation was birthed in America. AND GOD KNEW the son coming from east to west and this great nation that would be uh the most generous and the uh protector of nations of many in the world and who whose part in the birth painans of the first and second world war primarily this nation that that the god would bring forth and to be a superpower. AND FINALLY IN OUR DAY, in our day in this season would become the the singular superpower. And in your day, you begin to see the decline. And in your day, you begin to see immorality creep uh through over the nation. And in your day, YOU BEGIN TO SEE SODOM SWEEP over the nation. AND IN YOUR DAY, YOU see it come into every home and room. And in your day, YOU SEE THAT young people and your children carrying it in their hands, the ability to reach into the internet and enter the vast resource of the of of the world. AND IN YOUR DAY, YOU'VE SEEN THIS decline &gt;&gt; until you said, "Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. What an age, what a time that we're LIVING IN, OH GOD. WHAT CAN PRESERVE US? OH GOD, WHAT CAN HOLD US? WHAT CAN HOLD THESE marriages together? What can what can give a good girl a good man and a good man a GOOD WIFE? WHAT IS THERE? OH GOD, THIS GENERATION IS SINKING INTO SUCH A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS. WHO'S GOING TO PRESERVE THESE FAMILIES? WHO'S GOING TO PRESERVE these children? Who's going to preserve these young men and these young women? I can tell you friends, there will be a FEW AND NOT MANY THAT BY THE ZEAL OF GOD WILL GUIDE THEIR HOMES. GUIDE AND BE BE OFFICERS IN A CHURCH. AND THAT PEOPLE THAT COME TOGETHER WILL NOT COME TOGETHER TO HAVE A Sunday service. THEY'LL COME TOGETHER TO HEAR SOMETHING OF THE WORD of God. THEY'LL COME TOGETHER TO BE TRANSFORMED BY THE POWER of God. THEY'LL COME TOGETHER UNTIL THEY GET A DIFFERENT set of values. &gt;&gt; This woman didn't know. The guests at the dinner didn't know what she was doing. &gt;&gt; The disciples didn't know what she was doing. She didn't know what she was doing. &gt;&gt; All she knew &gt;&gt; IS THAT SOMETHING WASN'T QUITE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I don't know what it is, &gt;&gt; BUT I KNOW ONE THING THAT HE DESERVES MY BEST. &gt;&gt; And incidentally, 300 pence. They worked for one pence was as a silver Roman coin. That was a day's salary. And 300 days was nigh unto a year's salary that she bust and broke over his head in one place over his feet. We Christ is in another form. You're following a message whose messenger was put out of every door. He said, "I've been in Tucson here for about three years and all the doors are closed. I haven't had one invitation." Why? Not because of him, but while he was carrying &gt;&gt; the word THAT WOULD TRANSFORM YOU AND I THUS SAYETH THE LORD TO A NATION, carrying it in his BOSOM AND DOORS shutting &gt;&gt; because Revelation 3:14, I believe it is, HAD TO BE FULFILLED. ARE YOU LISTENING YOUNG PEOPLE? &gt;&gt; And he was found out who he me not me at me. Me you do not have always. He could have SAID IT TO THE PEOPLE BEFORE THEY PUT HIM OUT. IN REVELATION HE'S FOUND OUTSIDE, but it had to be lived out IN THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; A MINISTRY, A WORTHY MINISTRY, A SUPERNATURAL MINISTRY. ONE LIKE HAD NEVER BEEN EXPRESSED IN THE IN THE WORLD of revealing THE SECRET OF THE HEARTS AND TELLING PEOPLE WHERE THEY came from and those things they say and and the and the devil tried to bring up some cheap substitute even brought it on the television stuff cheap it was it wasn't even worth a wooden nickel &gt;&gt; are you with me &gt;&gt; and he's put out had to be put out he had to endure that &gt;&gt; he had TO BE PUT OUT BECAUSE IT WAS CHRIST IN HIM BEING PUT OUT. &gt;&gt; If he had to be put out, did he say, "Well, I don't have any more invitations. I guess I'll just give it up." No. No. There was a zeal of God. &gt;&gt; Forgive me, you may not understand this, but that zeal of God in him was saying there's a virgin bride that needs to be pregnantated with this word. &gt;&gt; THIS MUST HAPPEN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SERPENT DID WHAT HE DID. THIS MUST HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; HE IS WORTHY OF A VIRGIN BRIDE AND THE ZEAL OF GOD IN HIM. THE ZEAL OF GOD &gt;&gt; WAS PRESSING HIM UNTIL SHE SHOULD BE BROUGHT FORTH. AND I CAN SAY THIS MESSAGE IS BROUGHT FORTH. A VIRGIN BRIDE PREGNANT BY THE PURE SEED OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. You don't have to EMPOWER THAT SEED. THAT SEED IS ALREADY EMPOWERED WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND IT WILL BRING FORTH JESUS CHRIST IN THIS WORLD AND YOU ARE CALLED TO MANIFEST THAT LIFE. &gt;&gt; You don't have to produce it. You just manifest it. Neither the guests nor the Pharisees nor the disciples nor the woman doing it understood what was happening. The prophet messenger delivered the word seed to a bride people who will carry the seed to manifest Jesus Christ. And the prophet said in the message shalom, "God is a jealous God." &gt;&gt; You'll understand more what these phrases mean perhaps when you leave. He is jealous and he wants his wife pure. Isn't it amazing? He talks about wife in the same sentence. &gt;&gt; I haven't got time today. You have to forgive me. I haven't got time. Do you mind if I take my jacket off? In the Old Testament, I have I have a few scriptures. The greatest jealousy that can be known on earth and one of the causes for a lot of crimes is the jealousy of man over his wife or wife or her husband. And so in the Old Testament, so when a man is jealous over his wife and when a man and and and the spirit of jealousy comes on him and so on and then it finally finally God gives instructions. I haven't got time to go into it, but he can bring he can bring the wife to the priest and bring an offering and it's called the jealousy offering. It all had to do with one thing. There was a relationship between the husband and wife and what we have and what we know of down here. Listen to me friends. You're adults. I don't want to go into detail. But you must understand what is the absolute obsession of this age. It's sex. twisted sex, perverted sex over getting married. I can't You can't stand I dare you to stand in the in the market at the at the cash counter and all you'll be faced with is what Hollywood is doing. &gt;&gt; Hollywood, this woman is dumped and that guy is dumped and this one is getting and this one's getting a divorce. And I I just say what else is new? &gt;&gt; Garbage. Garbage. just trash and garbage. And you go down the street in the road and and there all all of the I won't go into it, but all the gay parades and what do you mean gay parade? Where's Where's all the straight people? Where's all the upright people? What's wrong with the right home? What's wrong with saying something about a right home? WHAT'S WRONG WITH SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT A FAMILY? &gt;&gt; COME ON, FOLKS. &gt;&gt; LET THE VOICE YOUR VOICE be heard. Tell you what, friends, you got an old man behind this pulpit, but the zeal of God burns in me. I wish it burned in every one of you the same degree it burns in me. Don't take a weak stand on these things. &gt;&gt; At least live it. He's a jealous God and he wants his wife pure. He wants her a virgin chased nothing in the world in into her at all. Altogether his word part OF HIM. WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? IT DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING FROM the world. IT DOESN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION OR ANY WORDS from the world to make up part of her being. He only wants her word, his word IN HER. WHAT'S HE SAYING? I WANT MY SEED IN MY LIFE, &gt;&gt; pregnantated with his word and possessed of his zeal to bring forth the life of Jesus Christ to sit on the throne of David in the millennium. Listen in the message. I hope I can say this in the way of a true prophet. in the message the way of a true prophet. You know what this last two paragraphs are? The last two stanzas of this is like a song. Oh lion of the tribe of Judah, &gt;&gt; rise up and roar is in his prayer. &gt;&gt; His closing prayer. Oh lion of the tribe of Judah, &gt;&gt; rise up and roar. Thou art roaring in this last day. Your eyes are narrowed. You're looking down. You're seeing THE SIN OF THIS SO-CALLED CHRISTIAN nation and world. You're seeing the sin of this nation when it's been brought when it's been bought with precious blood. What you talking about? Blood that didn't come by a sexual birth. Blood of the new creation of God. I'm preaching to a people. said, "A nation that you raised up HAS BEEN BOUGHT, PURCHASED. NO WONDER THIS MESSENGER of the owner is zealous." &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SEEING THE SIN OF THIS NATION when it's been brought bought with the precious blood. You're seeing how the denominations are waiting over your word. What's he saying? the denominations with their own word, &gt;&gt; their own seed, waiting over your word, &gt;&gt; just waiting and walking over it and saying, "Well, we don't believe that. This is what WE BELIEVE." I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; It's what GOD CONFIRMS IS HIS SEAT. &gt;&gt; I'M INTERESTED IN SEED THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; THUS SAITH THE LORD. AND WE HAVEN'T GOT THAT COME OUT OF SOME HUMAN MIND that's nothing more than a teaspoon of ashes. &gt;&gt; We're not interested in teaspoons of ashes. WE'RE INTERESTED IN WHAT GOD SAID &gt;&gt; and what not not what somebody thinks he said. &gt;&gt; See how the false prophets are lying. That's not that's not uh maybe what they consider culture language. That was the truth. &gt;&gt; See how false prophets are lying. What is false prophet? That's somebody who's carrying a word and their word, God's truth, they're denying. Roar, oh lion of Judah. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about this li this line. this not this lion but this line of this lineage that almost didn't make it almost couldn't make it. Think of it when Judah looked like there would be no more children birth. Oh lion of Judah, let your prophets cry out. &gt;&gt; When God speaks, who can keep from prophesying? It's the word of God coming out of the Bible. moving up through the prophet. How can he hold his peace? If he would, he'd blow to pieces. Oh God, let your prophets roar. &gt;&gt; Let Lord roar out. Roar out your message &gt;&gt; and let every creature of your kingdom take heed. &gt;&gt; Said, I believe, Lord, if you'd send Amos here, he'd cry out the same thing. For he could not cry. But if he he is a prophet of the Lord, he's a sender forth of the word. In other words, he transfers the word, the seed word of God. He is sent forth by the word with the word. And he is the word. &gt;&gt; Now Lord, let it be done in the name of Jesus Christ. That's the end of that message. The woman, she happened to be Mary of Bethany. that broke the ointment. She's the sister of Martha and Lazarus. I'm taking you. I mentioned that because she was so disheartened when her pastor Jesus Christ wouldn't come when her her brother was sick and he waited till he died. She had disappointments and she had been she had walked with Jesus as you have walked in the message for a long time not only months but perhaps years she had walked. So she's seen she's seen all the great crowds and she saw all the perhaps miracles and saw all of these things and now uh he's become rather silent and she has seen a decline and perhaps we've seen something that is you think is a diminishing and you say what is all of this happening? What is all this business in the message? What is all this stuff? Have you been there? &gt;&gt; Have you read some things? Have you been there? You don't have to answer that. I know you have. What is this? What is this about ministers of the message denying it and leaving it? Well, when Jesus she walked with Jesus and Jesus said some words and a whole multitude of people left him. So she saw that where' they all go and then finally 70 that he chose to work with him, commissioned with him to go and preach with him. 70 they said who can who who who can understand this? who can understand, you know, what he said, who I can't put this together. Uh, some of it seems to go against the Bible, the Torah. Some of we we don't understand it. We can't understand it. And they they kind of withdrew and finally they left. So, she saw 70 leave preachers, &gt;&gt; miracle workers, &gt;&gt; sent out by Jesus himself. &gt;&gt; Saw them go. I have to ask I have to ask this congregation. I want you to ask yourself where would you be? &gt;&gt; Where would you be? You put yourself back in the Bible. I don't have to answer that. You put yourself there. When you look at me, you don't look at something that's historical. I'm talking about something as fresh as tomorrow morning's newspaper. &gt;&gt; I only ask you that because I asked myself that she couldn't explain everything. In fact, she couldn't hardly explain anything. &gt;&gt; All she knew here, he sits just six days before the Passover. Just six days and all the people in the population and all the popularity is gone and all the greatness is gone. And here he is at a at a supper and he's sitting there. Somehow it's not just right. It's not right. She runs home, gets an alabaster box. I'm going to ask you, what is your alabaster box? And brings it to him and breaks it. She doesn't understand. She's just driven. Now watch closely, friends. I have something to say. She just driven. She breaks that ointment on him and spills all out and everybody. Everybody, it's such a waste. She didn't know what she was doing. I said right in that study, I said, I I don't know why I was so obsessed. maybe 40, 45 or 50 years ago. It sounds like A LONG TIME. IT'S NOT long ago. I lived it &gt;&gt; and I went overseas to Africa and saw the people and many of them couldn't speak very clear English and they're listening to a message ON TAPE AND THEY'D look at me with those dark eyes and know that I had books and know that I had tapes, know I had red volumes, know I had it in this form and that form and they're saying, "Oh, you're so lucky. You're so fortunate you have it. And I I heard some of them speaking and as I listened they're speaking in Kentucky accent because they just listen to the tapes. I talked to some ministers and they learned English from listening to the tapes. And I thought, I can hardly understand some of those tapes myself because the the production is so poor and the and the uh it's so poor and I don't know what they're listening to it on. And I come back and I spoke to a a widow woman. I won't use her name. And I told her this. I said, "I look at those black eyes. They don't have the message." I said, "I just I'm I feel driven." I didn't tell her that. I want to clean these tapes. I want to filter these tapes and make the best tapes we can. Why? What was driving it was a zeal &gt;&gt; THAT GOD'S PEOPLE, THE ELECT OUT THERE, &gt;&gt; MIGHT HEAR CLEARLY, AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE, THE VOICE. And so, WE STARTED CLEANING THE TAPES. And in this study today, I can't can't remember ever doing it. I just thank God. God, I just wanted to pour this part of my life out. And I got others and others other young man. He worked four years. Four years. He wasn't worried about salary. I think we gave him something to eat. I don't know what we gave him. I have no idea. But he worked for four years full time. Full time in a little log room. And we had all the tapes there. and they listen to all the tapes and make a diary of the sounds and the noises and then start cleaning and filtering the tapes. We filtered 530 tapes. 530 in four years. I'm so glad to have poured out those years. They had on the radio broadcast for a little while. Some people, you know them, the Ploachers from Montana and they're probably streaming say greetings to the Ploer family. I heard that Sister Ploer was coming. Matthew Redell told me sister Ploer's parents or her mothers. He's He says, "I think she's going to be she's going to be visiting her mother in Vancouver." And I was a little bit nervous. She hadn't been here before. Never thinking of maybe moving here or whatever. I never want to try to persuade people on that. And she was here with her husband and walked out and and almost everybody had gone. And then I saw they were still there. I was talking to a person. I said, "Excuse me, I have to run. I want to see these people." I believe Brother Mark and Sister Sally, you were just with the poachers, right? I saw the pictures looked very nice. And so I walked over just brother and sister poster by themselves. I said, "Well, how are you?" I said, "It's so nice to to meet you." I said, "Your husband has told me about you. It's nice to see you." I said, "I understand that your mother's from Canada and is in Vancouver." She said, "Actually, my mother's in Langley." Oh. I said, "Goodness, Langley, just right here. Your mother's in Langley." And she said, "Yes." She said, "Many years ago, you had a radio broadcast." And she said, "And my mother wrote and you sent her tapes and then she wrote again and you sent her a church age book." And she said, "I read the church age book and I came into the message." &gt;&gt; That was about about 10 seconds of a testimony. I thought, "Praise God. I'm so glad we so glad we sent her." Didn't know what you're doing when somebody's sending out that church age book. But isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; This woman didn't know what she was doing. I don't want to conclude. I've got to conclude right away. But I don't want to conclude without saying unto us a son is unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given. And he'll be called wonderful and counselor and mighty God and the father and all of these things. and he will be on the throne of his father David and a prophet comes and lets us know who wants to know that'll be in the millennium he'll be on his but all of that scripture from one point to the other point the zeal of God shall perform this &gt;&gt; and you may wonder what it is that you sense or feel in a service perhaps like This it is the zeal of God that is registering something in your heart and life and soul that is that is is is pressing forward to perform this. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS ONE THING IN HIS MIND REVEAL AND MANIFEST JESUS CHRIST IN THIS WORLD. YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING? HE'S SAYING I'VE COME TO OVER I'VE COME TO TAKE IT OVER. &gt;&gt; I PAID FOR THIS WHOLE WORLD. I'VE HAD I'VE SENT A PROPHET AND HE TOLD YOU HOW IT'S GOING TO BE renovated &gt;&gt; and it's going to burn up with with UNQUENCHABLE FIRE &gt;&gt; and the and the thing that's in you right now is THE SPIRIT OF HIM WHO SPOKE this &gt;&gt; is in me and the zeal of God is in ME &gt;&gt; AND THUS SAYITH THE LORD IS IN ME &gt;&gt; AND the and the seed of God is in me producing Jesus CHRIST &gt;&gt; AND THAT JESUS CHRIST HAS ALREADY DECLARED I own this place. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I I'M GOING TO COME BACK HERE WITH MY BRIDE AND LIVE HERE. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get rid of all of this filth. &gt;&gt; AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS EVEN THE HEAVENS WILL BE ON FIRE. WHY? BECAUSE THOSE VOICES that you may hear coming on the radio, all of you on the television and God forbid that and on on and it's printed down and through the internet and they call it the worldwide world web. I have an announcement. There's another web &gt;&gt; and there's another world. And the prophet says even the heavens will be on fire because of the demon power &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THE DARKNESS of devils. &gt;&gt; I shouldn't have to I shouldn't have to expound on it. You should catch that AND JUST SAY GLORY BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; The zeal THAT'S IN ME IS CRYING OUT FOR THAT. OH FIRE OF GOD BURN ON BURN UP. BURN UP THESE ELEMENTS OUT OF THE HEAVENS. BURN ALL THIS PERVERSION OUT OF THE HEAVENS. BURN ALL THIS DEMON POWER IN DARKNESS. He said me you don't have always. I want to say to this congregation, we need to seize. We need to really ponder this message. Ponder what the Holy Spirit will speak to you in the next coming days. I will tell you, even if we're like Mary of Bethany, she maybe just made a lot of meals. She entertained the word. When she had a sick brother, he was called. Christ was called. He didn't come when they wanted to. Didn't always get the response they wanted. Began to see things that they couldn't understand. This one leaves. That one denies. The church secretary is gone. We understand he committed suicide or hung himself, cast himself down. What a record. Who wants to join that church? &gt;&gt; Only those &gt;&gt; who have zeal of God in it. &gt;&gt; Only those elected. &gt;&gt; Only those that ARE GIVEN AN INSIGHT &gt;&gt; AND they know the season that it's him. &gt;&gt; And to me, to me, this is not a dark hour in that we rise and have shone with the light of God. Are you listening? This is not to not to just energize you, not to emotionalize you, but this is ONE OF OUR GREATEST OPPORTUNITIES. &gt;&gt; When I hear all kinds of things TAKING PLACE, I SAY, "PRAISE GOD." &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT JESUS SAID? YOU KNOW WHAT JESUS SAID TO SCRIBES AND PHARISEES? GO AND FILL UP THE CUP OF YOUR FATHERS. &gt;&gt; Fill it up. Get this thing over with. Whatever you're going to do, go and do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. DID IT CHANGE HIM? NOT A BIT. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said something that I want to be sure to get this. And I'm speaking now to many that might be on the internet and you're listening for whatever reason you're listening. I'm not too sure. But the prophet of God in this generation have been vindicated thousands of times. He said this, "You will remember these words on your deathbed &gt;&gt; and you'll roll back and forth on your deathbed." And in your dying hour, you will hear my voice. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; And I say, "So be it &gt;&gt; and thus it shall be." And if I were you, I if there's an ounce or a tinkle of of of GOD'S SPIRIT AT THIS MOMENT, I WOULD CRY OUT TO HIM. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY NOT be married. You may not be another one, BUT I WOULD CRY OUT TO HIM. AND I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS, BUT I WAS COMPELLED. And I told my wife yesterday, I'm going to speak to the people on the internet. You rejectors and you doubters of the word. If you're doubting the word, I WOULD CAST THAT OFF AND SAY, "GOD, DELIVER ME FROM THIS SPIRIT OF UNBELIEF. Deliver me." It didn't WORK FOR ANYONE THAT DISBELIEVED IN THE WORD OF GOD. AND IT WON'T BELIEVE FOR YOU. It won't work for you BEFORE YOU ARE BEFORE YOU COME TO THAT PLACE. He said, "You'll hear my voice." &gt;&gt; And the prophet said further to the people, he said, "If you could only recognize &gt;&gt; the voice, &gt;&gt; not my voice, it's his voice. &gt;&gt; IF IT'S HIS VOICE, WHO IS IT? IT'S A HUSBAND." AND WHAT DOES THE HUSBAND HAVE? HE HAS SEED. AND HE'S JEALOUS OVER THAT SEED. HE'S JEALOUS OVER THAT SEED. And that seed's going to arrive to its right place. I have so much to say. Abraham had seed, had the right seed, BUT IT WOULDN'T WORK in Hagar. &gt;&gt; THE RIGHT SEED IN THE WRONG WOMB. And the word of God in THESE DENOMINATIONS WILL NOT WORK. &gt;&gt; WILL NOT WORK. &gt;&gt; Say amen, folks. &gt;&gt; THIS RIGHT, THIS RIGHT SEED IN UNBELIEVING HEART WILL NOT WORK. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But the right seed in the right womb will bring forth in Isaac. The right seed in the right womb, the right seed, THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW CREATION of God in the Virgin Mary brought forth a child and a son unto us a son is given. &gt;&gt; And to think that that son grew up and returned in the end time and send a message your way. I don't know where you heard it. Well, I heard it from my mom and my dad. I didn't hear it from my mom and my dad, but I sat here where grace is sitting. And I saw the prophet of God talk to a woman with a blind girl about 12 years old, 10, 12 years old. And I thought, I I I want to really listen to this. I want to really hear this. I've never seen this before. And eyes of her eye her eyeballs are just white. And brother Brandham prays once. He looks at her twice, three, four times, five times, six times. She's just the same. Put his hand around her head, said, "Satan, an angel from God, gave this gift to me &gt;&gt; and told me if I could get the people to believe that nothing would stand before my prayers, not even cancer." &gt;&gt; And the people are here and they are believing. and I adjure you in the name of the living God to loose her and let her go. That time he just took her by the shoulders and turned her to the people and then lifted her up. Her eyes were as straight as mine. &gt;&gt; That anchored in my heart and I've never seen this before. THIS IS DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; And I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THAT VOICE WAS SAYING. I want to know. AND IT IT WENT ON THROUGH and then people and then I hear all he's gone off and he believes the serpent's seed that Cain is the son of the serpent. Well, I know I had my disappointments. I didn't know. I didn't even know to baptize. Here I was preaching the gospel seven years preaching. I wasn't too sure if God was one or two or three. I wasn't sure about these things. Why am I saying this to you? Because there was something in me that was greater than disappointment. Something in you THAT'S GREATER THAN ALL YOUR FRIENDS. SOMETHING IN YOU THAT'S GREATER THAN ALL THIS DARKNESS. SOMETHING IN YOU THAT'S GREATER THAN ALL ALL THIS ON THE WEB. &gt;&gt; I SAY TO YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, THOSE HEAVENS THAT HOLD THOSE VOICES, ALL THOSE DENIERS SHALL BE BURNED UP. AND ONE THING WILL REMAIN AND THAT IS THE VOICE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; UNTO YOU A SON IS GIVEN. &gt;&gt; UNTO YOU A BRIDEGROOM'S GIVEN &gt;&gt; UNTO YOU. A VOICE IS GIVEN THAT HAS CALLED YOU OUT OF THIS DILEMMA. &gt;&gt; OUT OF THIS TERRIBLE STATE OF CONFUSION. COME TO PEACE, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; Come to peace. Come. &gt;&gt; I'm well aware. Some of you wrestled. Some of you wondered, but I said to you, come. Come. Just drop it. Come this morning. Come to his feet, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. What an opportunity. It's not the church building. It's not the church name. It has nothing to do with it. We don't know anything of the house that Mary was in. We don't know anything of the We have never seen the alabaster box, but we have something. It's a life. A life. And with that life, we can go out and earn living and earn perhaps do well, live a good life. But when it's all over, what do we have? And so I pray, oh God, I don't know how you will deal with individuals. I don't know how you'll speak to them, but I prayed about this service, Lord. And I pray that somehow you'll speak very very very deep, not just to stir their hearts in a in a moment or an emotional moment, but that they might see the hour that we're in within the scope of this message, within the scope of the believers worldwide and where they are. Maybe some this is just a title on the church or a name and they they're believers of the message. But I pray, oh God, that there be a reality. Let the Holy Spirit give them a birth, oh God, in the word of God. Give them a birth, oh God. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Move every power of darkness. Move every confusion. MOVE EVERY DEMON FORCE OUT FROM THIS BUILDING, oh God. AND MAY MEN AND WOMEN RESPOND AS you would have them to respond, Lord. May they begin to have a relationship with you. &gt;&gt; Me, you have not always. So Lord, I want to before I leave this pulpit today, I want to say that I love you. I wonder if we could have someone at the piano. I sat and I was singing, "I love him. I love him." when a voice spoke out, cried out, "YOU'LL NOT COMMIT SUICIDE, soldier boy." A day later, I met him. A day later, he was being prayed with. A day later, he was delivered. Friends, that God is present in this [music] building. &gt;&gt; I could not make it more more real to you. Let that God, maybe you've carried on, but you're not satisfied with your life and you know that you're not living where you ought to be. I want you to be man enough as w as Mary was woman enough to do what she didn't even understand. Maybe you'd like to stand. Maybe you'd like to come [music] and stand here forward as an evidence. I'm dedicating myself. I'm giving myself holy to this one. Maybe you'll sing it with me. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; We come to first love. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Salation. [music] [music] [music] I love him. I [music] love him [music and singing] because he love me [music and singing] and [music and singing] just smile. Salation. [music] [music] [music] There's someone else [music] who wants to come. [singing] [music] I [music] love [music] [singing] his word for [music] me and [music] her life. [music] Salation [music] [music] and a message here you [music] hear. I speak to you on the internet and perhaps some that are here. I trust not this message. will linger &gt;&gt; with you as long as you live. &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of opinion the person has about this Christ, this message will linger. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he's made himself known to you? Aren't you glad he's come to your home? Aren't you glad he's come to your house? You might just be a teenager. You might be to someone in a in a in A CHRISTIAN HOME. AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU'RE IN THAT KIND OF a home? &gt;&gt; I was just young fellas was your age. I was just young. A message like this stirred me [music] very very deep. Stirred me very very deep. That's when it started. Didn't start years later. I want you to be real respectful [music] now. I sing it, please. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He was [music] first &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Purchase my Sal [music] [music] said I never see you again on this earth. Those words are just as real to me. I don't care when they were sad because the message lives on. &gt;&gt; And he said, "If this if you never see me again on this earth, remember in your dying hour, he may be gone and you may be still here. And those on the internet may still be listening. And I'm addressing you because I know you're there. God, witness to my heart that you'd be there." and these words in your dying hour this message will ech back and forth on your deathbed. Friends, I wouldn't I wouldn't risk that for anything. I'd say if I were you, where's my alabaster box? &gt;&gt; And those of you that are believers, listen to me. Listen to me. In this hour, th this is this hour is similar to the one that Mary was in. He was on his way to a terrible end, a terrible crucifixion. He was on his way to what appeared to be obvious defeat. But the prophet said THIS WAS HIS GREATEST VICTORY BECAUSE NOW HIS ENTIRE MINISTRY was being crowned. Hallelujah. Listen, the very thing that you live for is is destined to be crowned. &gt;&gt; Who wants to turn back? How many here want to see the change of their body? &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. I want to see it. Some don't want it. I want to see your hand. You want it. You desire it. &gt;&gt; You're going to leave a lot of peers behind. We're not into an emotional thing. YOU'VE ALREADY RECEIVED THE SEED. SAY, "I'VE RECEIVED THAT SEED. I've received THAT WORD." HE SENT that personal message to me. It's a personal thing. I'M NOT PREACHING just to A CROWD. IT'S A PERSONAL MESSAGE TO ME. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; like each one to pray with me. Going to pray for all these all of you that are standing here. I want you just to Hey, this is more than just a moment. &gt;&gt; This is a rare moment. A rare moment in time. I have to tell you, this is a glorious, glorious opportunity that you have, my brothers, my precious sisters. [music] A glorious opportunity you have. Heavenly Father, my father, my father, you that have sent your word seed, eternal life seed. Oh God, we don't want any of man's words, man's seed. We don't want anything that just has a time limit on it, but we want this eternal seed. Oh Jesus Christ, giver of life, author of life. You that gave yourself for us, a propitiation, a substitute for us. Come, oh God, we so desire to pour out our lives at your feet, to pour out all that we have. Oh God, grant us this moment, Lord. Grant us this moment in time as we express our love [music] to you. Oh lamb of God. Lamb of God, we love you. We love you. Oh, we love you Lord Jesus. We love you. We love you Lord. We love you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to sing him. We love you Lord. I love you Lord. Brother Derek, if you'd help us, help me, please. I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I love you, [singing and music] Lord. Let his voice as blend as one. And I [music] worship, [music] oh [singing] my soul. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Rejoice my king. [music] [music] Let it be a sweet [singing] sweet [music] in my ear. [music] Oh, I love [music] you, Lord. Receive Lord and I [music] th [music] these dear ones. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Bless these dear ones. Oh God, God bless them with great [music and singing] my [singing] [music] sweet son. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. [music] Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; My Jesus, my [music and singing] Jesus, I love thee. Jesus, [singing] [music] I love thee. I know. [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, come amongst us, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; All [music and singing] of [music] [singing] Let's unite together in one voice. [music] My gracious redeemer, [music] my savior, [singing] our God. [music] If ever I love thee, my Jesus [music and singing] is We love you, Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; I want to thank you for this congregation, Lord. &gt;&gt; I thank you for these men and women. Thank you for these young people. Thank you, oh God, for the guests that have come. It wasn't an accident that they were in this meeting. Some have left. We do not know why. I pray, Father, that they didn't escape or leave your presence. I pray, oh God, for each one that is standing here, Lord Jesus, may something compel them. &gt;&gt; May the same thing that moved Mary. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we may we may give something of ourselves. Oh God, we do not know even what we're doing, but we just give ourselves. Take me, Lord. Take me. Let this people be a witness for you, Lord. In this age of deniers, in this age of mockers, raise up a people, oh God, that stand tall above all of these things. Unmovable, unshakeable faith. Supercharge us with the Holy Spirit. ANOTHER BAPTISM OF QUAD. OH, FATHER, FATHER, I pray with all that is within me that the people may receive everything that you [music] have in store for them. May we, oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Christ, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'll just sing a few more words. I'd like you to sing with me. Christ the transforming light. Those you that know it, sing it up. Christ the transforming [music] light. And then we'll dismiss the transform. [music] &gt;&gt; Come Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come. All transforming lives of this revealed [music] world this night making [music] his glory [singing] shine. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Release your heart now [singing] to reflect his [music] grace. Causing [singing] the world to see. [music] Love that will grow till others [music] shall know. Jesus [singing] in me. Here's [music] what's happening this morning. Life is no longer mine. [music and singing] I yield it all to all. [music] Fill me that I may [singing] shine until [music] I see. [music] Oh, to reflect his grace. [singing] Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; the world to [singing] see. Love [music] that will others shall [music] Jesus reveal [singing] in [music] me. Triumpa peace is mine [music] now. Jesus reign with [music and singing] divine [music and singing] and victory over sin. [music] Oh, to reflect [music] his grace, calling [music] the world to see love that will [music] others [music] &gt;&gt; my Lord Lord Jesus, I know you will hear me as I pray from the very [music] depths of my heart. First, I want to thank you for all that have come and attended this morning. I thank you, Father, and pray that you'll go with Brother Tom and Joanne as they will leave for Seattle and be with the Saints in Reon. Pray, oh God, you'll be with the saints in Victoria. Now I pray for all of those that have streamed this service or ever will stream it.
