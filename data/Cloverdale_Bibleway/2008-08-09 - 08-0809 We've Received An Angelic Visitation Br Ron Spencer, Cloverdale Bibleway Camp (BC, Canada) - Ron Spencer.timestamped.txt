[1:29] and started singing, you know, and the
[1:32] Bible says one will put a thousand, two
[1:33] will put, amen, 10,000 a flight.
[1:38] And uh one thing I've always found very
[1:41] helpful, you know, if you get some
[1:43] people, brother Ron be talking, somebody
[1:46] find somebody who really loves the Lord
[1:48] and get real close to them. Amen.

[8:09] John, Brother Gary, if you'd come and
[8:10] open the service in a word of prayer
[8:12] tonight.
[8:14] Man, if you've got a need,
[8:16] just look to the Lord at this time.
[8:19] If you're listening in on the internet,
[8:21] you've got a need, just take it before
[8:22] the Lord and we'll agree with you right
[8:24] now. Amen. To have that need that the
[8:26] Lord would meet your need. Amen.
[8:38] Father, we're
[8:41] glad to be washed by the water of the
[8:43] word tonight, Lord.
[8:46] Lord, just realizing
[8:49] that's the positive, Lord, of the rain
[8:51] that falls outside. Father,
[8:54] we love you, Lord, and we love your
[8:56] presence.
[8:58] Already in our midst tonight, Father.
[9:00] Lord, we don't have to work it up, Lord.
[9:02] It comes from inside and just bubbles
[9:04] up, Father. Lord, just feeling every
[9:07] expecting heart tonight, Lord Jesus.
[9:10] Knowing you're on the scene for every
[9:12] desire, every need, every heart, Lord,
[9:16] we don't gather year after year, Lord,
[9:17] for vain reasons. Lord, we gather for a
[9:20] closer walk with you, Lord Jesus. A more
[9:24] dedicated life, Lord, realizing, Lord,
[9:27] just even reading your prophecy message
[9:29] before the service, Lord, he was calling
[9:31] it on the scene, Lord, even then,
[9:33] Father. How much longer can it go, Lord
[9:35] Jesus? We know you're coming, coming
[9:38] quickly, Lord. We want to have ready
[9:39] hearts, Lord. Ready to step over, Lord.
[9:42] Ready to go over, Lord, as 100s, Lord.
[9:45] not falling across the line, but running
[9:47] across the line. Lord Jesus, make a way
[9:50] for us tonight. Lord, if we're not
[9:51] ready,
[9:52] &gt;&gt; if we're not running, Lord, let us run,
[9:54] Lord. Help us to live our lives, Lord,
[9:57] as our heart desires, nor Lord, not as
[10:00] life would drag us down into, Lord, but
[10:02] as our heart directs us, Lord, and as
[10:04] your word directs us, Father. Lord, I
[10:06] pray this camp meeting tonight would
[10:08] just be a supernatural event, Lord.
[10:10] every heart would be expecting, none
[10:12] would be drifting off to other thoughts
[10:14] or other places, Lord Jesus, but just to
[10:16] right here, Lord, for all the all the
[10:19] work that's gone into it, Lord. I pray
[10:20] you'd bless it. Bless our dedication,
[10:23] Lord. Bless your word tonight, Lord, as
[10:25] it falls on our hearts, Father. We want
[10:28] to thank you for every bit of it.
[10:29] Father, we love you, Lord. We just ask,
[10:32] Lord, you'd receive our praises tonight
[10:34] in Jesus name. Amen.
[10:41] and you can have your seats.

[23:15] We'll work till Jesus comes. We'll work
[23:20] till Jesus comes. We'll work till Jesus
[23:26] comes and
[23:31] Jesus got a hold of my life and he won't
[23:35] let me go.
[23:39] Jesus got into my heart. He got into my
[23:43] soul.
[23:46] I used to be so sad.
[23:50] But now just free and
[23:54] Jesus got a hold of my life and he won't
[23:57] let me go.
[24:02] Jesus got a hold of my life and he won't
[24:05] let me go.
[24:09] Jesus got into my heart. He got into my
[24:13] soul.

[24:42] Thank you. Aren't you glad Jesus got a
[24:44] hold of your life?
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um I'm going to ask the choir to
[24:48] come up. We're going to sing uh the
[24:50] wonder of your cross. I've been I was
[24:52] thinking tossing and trying to decide
[24:54] whether this song was really on my
[24:56] heart. I had a brother call me and uh
[25:00] told him how much he was blessed by this
[25:01] song. We trust that someone tonight will
[25:04] be blessed. Maybe the the choir could
[25:06] come maybe as they do. Let's sing
[25:08] together. Jesus, all for Jesus.
[25:14] Jesus,
[25:17] all for Jesus.
[25:23] All my have and have
[25:29] an ever dream.
[25:37] Jesus.
[25:41] All for Jesus.
[25:47] All I am and have
[25:53] and ever hope to be. For it's only in
[25:56] your will.
[25:59] For it's only in
[26:04] your will that I
[26:08] free.
[26:11] Glory
[26:14] in
[26:16] your will that I that I am free.
[26:24] Jesus.
[26:29] All for Jesus.
[26:35] all my
[26:49] some folks today went through and there
[26:51] was a station at the cross. But you know
[26:52] what? I don't know. I heard that some
[26:54] people never got to the cross.
[26:57] And if you didn't get to the cross,
[26:59] everything you did today was for
[27:01] nothing. You don't get any points. which
[27:03] is an illustration. If you don't if you
[27:05] never get to the cross, there is nothing
[27:07] in your life that can ever amount to
[27:10] anything.
[27:12] Amen.
[27:14] And we can't put enough emphasis on
[27:16] that. It is the most important thing a
[27:20] person needs to come to the foot of the
[27:21] cross. So, we're going to trust that
[27:23] you'd be blessed by this song as we sing
[27:25] it tonight.
[27:55] The wonder of your cross shall be our
[27:59] meditation
[28:07] to gather in that shadow as the sun went
[28:12] down
[28:19] to weep with those who thought that you
[28:23] were leaving.
[28:26] You were leaving Jesus,
[28:30] a humble king who never wore an earthly
[28:36] crown.
[28:48] to steal away at night when they took
[28:51] down your body
[28:59] with love and care to lay it in a
[29:03] borrowed grave
[29:10] to go with Mary to the place they laid
[29:16] you.
[29:17] where they laid you, Jesus.
[29:22] And in the morning find the stone was
[29:26] rolled away.
[29:32] The cross.
[29:34] Oh, the wonderful
[29:38] cross.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Wonderful
[29:41] cross.
[29:43] What glory,
[29:46] what victory

[37:49] Till my true belief
[37:52] that last night
[37:59] I will break
[38:02] the old
[38:09] and exchange
[38:13] for a crown.
[38:19] Amen.
[38:21] How wonderful.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; I hope you're all comfortable.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; We tried to keep it as uh moderate
[38:28] inside as possible. It's hard to keep it
[38:32] so it's uh comfortable throughout the
[38:35] whole tent. We don't want you on the
[38:36] outside to get too cool. So, we're
[38:39] dropping the curtains down or the side
[38:43] flaps. We hope that you're not too
[38:45] stuffy here up in the front. So, as long
[38:48] as you're comfortable, we don't want to
[38:49] make it too comfortable because we we
[38:53] don't want you to doze while the service
[38:55] is in progress.
[38:57] Like someone said, if you can sleep
[38:59] while I'm preaching, you go right ahead.
[39:02] I don't think you're going to sleep
[39:03] while brother Ron Spencer's preaching. I
[39:05] just I'm quite sure of that. Uh
[39:11] we only have tonight and tomorrow's
[39:13] service and uh on one hand there's going
[39:17] to be a lot of folks who put so much
[39:19] into it, so much work, so much labor. Uh
[39:22] some have worked uh most of the night
[39:26] sometimes getting ready and all the
[39:27] preparation. Those in the kitchen, I
[39:30] know you go in, you go through and pick
[39:32] up your food, but they start very very
[39:35] early in the morning and uh to have
[39:38] everything ready and work till way late
[39:40] at night and we're thankful for that.
[39:43] They're they're they're missing the
[39:45] meeting. They're watching the screen
[39:47] right now and I know that they would
[39:49] much prefer being right here. We
[39:51] appreciate that. Uh
[39:55] the Lord has given us this uh camp
[39:58] facility and had he not made it
[40:00] possible, we wouldn't have the kind of
[40:03] liberty.
[40:05] uh we wouldn't have the kind of feel
[40:06] that we have. I know that for those of
[40:09] you that have been here in previous
[40:11] camps and uh some of you many of you
[40:13] that are here have have been to all
[40:15] seven years that we were here
[40:17] previously. Was seven, wasn't it?
[40:19] Brother Tom and uh but there uh it's a
[40:23] feeling of we're at home and I think
[40:26] that's a feel that you have. you young
[40:29] people have mentioned it and many of the
[40:32] uh others of the congregation have
[40:34] mentioned it. I I'm glad you feel that
[40:37] way and I'm glad you've mentioned it
[40:39] because that's personally how I feel.
[40:43] It's not just a feeling but there are
[40:45] many uh uh liberties which we're able to
[40:49] take
[40:51] uh when you have it and you own it
[40:53] yourself which before we had to you know
[40:57] always ask permission. Sometimes we were
[41:00] not accepted or our permission was not
[41:04] granted and we weren't able to do things
[41:06] we wanted to do. But now it's it's all
[41:09] different and all I can say is thank you
[41:11] Jesus. Amen.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; You You've certainly been good to me.
[41:17] You've certainly been good to us.
[41:19] Brother Brandham made a statement. I
[41:20] want to just take a moment to uh before
[41:24] our brother Ron comes to preach because
[41:26] we actually have nothing better to do.
[41:29] We're here at camp and uh this is all we
[41:32] have to do this evening. When we're
[41:34] done, you know, we don't want it to end
[41:37] too soon anyway, do we? So, we just want
[41:39] to savor every moment. But in the
[41:42] message influence,
[41:44] brother Brandham
[41:46] uh he mentioned uh pilgrims progress and
[41:50] uh the young people today. I was going
[41:53] to have brother Tom say something about
[41:55] it because he would be best to represent
[41:58] the those that have labored for weeks
[42:01] and I would guess even into the months
[42:04] to prepare. Uh uh I know that some
[42:08] started this morning, including myself
[42:11] and my wife and my daughters at 7:30.
[42:14] They said, "You must be down here to get
[42:16] ready." And we all had to have a part.
[42:19] Brother Lance spoke on the cross.
[42:21] Brother John Andy's was the evangelist.
[42:24] Brother Tom, he preached at at a at a
[42:27] certain station. And uh I was at house
[42:31] beautiful as the interpreter to uh start
[42:35] Christian and the group on their way and
[42:38] it was really a wonderful time. So I
[42:40] thought I wanted to see what brother
[42:42] Brandham had said. I know he mentioned
[42:44] Pilgrim's Progress quite a number of
[42:46] times but he said this in the message
[42:49] influence.
[42:51] uh he said uh Abraham Lincoln had two
[42:55] books uh Pilgrim's Progress and the
[42:58] Bible and you see what kind of a
[43:01] character that molded.
[43:05] So if you young people have not read
[43:08] Pilgrim's Progress would be good for you
[43:11] and I'm sure you'd have some inspiration
[43:13] now after today to read and see why that
[43:16] molded the kind of person uh the
[43:19] pilgrims pro progress in the Bible. And
[43:23] then he went on to say this, and this is
[43:25] what I really want to convey to you this
[43:28] evening. Just let me go in your house
[43:31] and see what kind of pictures you got on
[43:34] your wall and let me go in your home or
[43:39] your office
[43:41] and uh and let's see what kind of music
[43:45] playing
[43:47] uh what you read.
[43:50] what you look at and I can pretty well
[43:53] tell what's on the inside of you because
[43:58] it feeds on that. Notice he didn't say
[44:01] you feed on that. He said it feeds on
[44:04] that. That spirit that's in you feeds on
[44:07] that. And then he went on to say this.
[44:10] And oh to this entire congregation, I
[44:14] want you to know as an individual, as a
[44:16] pastor, this really touched me.
[44:21] Don't let it condemn you if you don't
[44:23] think you measure up, but use it as an
[44:26] example and a and a a a high water mark
[44:32] to move to. He says, "And owe to a
[44:35] home."
[44:37] If we made a home more lovely,
[44:41] children wouldn't want to run away.
[44:44] Make things more for them where they
[44:48] feel welcome and nice and comfortable at
[44:52] home where home he said they can't
[44:56] hardly wait to get till they get there.
[45:00] And that's the way home should be.
[45:04] this here group of people under this
[45:06] tent. You that are visiting, that's
[45:09] fine. You can listen to me. But I speak
[45:12] largely to the Bible way congregation
[45:15] that fellowship here and those of you
[45:17] that are part of the congregation that
[45:19] perhaps live some distance away, but you
[45:22] consider home for you. Uh you're the
[45:25] family. You're the children
[45:29] of the family that God has caused to
[45:32] gather here.
[45:35] And I say from my heart, we've tried to
[45:38] make things welcome. We've tried to make
[45:42] things lovely. I don't mean nice,
[45:46] flowery, but I mean lovely with an
[45:49] atmosphere, with a welcoming spirit.
[45:53] We've tried to make things so that you
[45:55] want to come back. We've tried to make
[45:58] things so that even when the weather
[46:00] isn't very nice, you want to be here.
[46:03] You don't want to miss a meeting because
[46:05] it is too it it is just too in inspiring
[46:09] for you. It's it's a food for your soul.
[46:13] It it strengthens you. And you young
[46:16] people, we like to have things nice for
[46:18] you. We try to do things so that you
[46:21] want to come back. And you you sitting
[46:24] here today are a witness to that. You
[46:26] want to be here. And those of you that
[46:28] are visiting, I'm sure you want to come
[46:30] back. And we want you to come back. We
[46:33] want you to come into this atmosphere.
[46:35] We want you to participate and be part
[46:37] of the miracles that God is doing. You
[46:41] say, "Is God doing miracles?"
[46:45] Well,
[46:47] I want to show you one.
[46:51] Some of us in our congregation, we have
[46:53] seen these, but I have some slides I
[46:56] want you to see
[46:58] of our brother Ron Spencer
[47:03] just
[47:05] that is him last September,
[47:09] not one year ago yet. I wish we had the
[47:13] giant screen so you could see it.
[47:16] That's brother Ron Spencer last
[47:18] September
[47:21] and he was in that state
[47:23] in that burn ward
[47:26] and sister Connie was between two
[47:29] hospitals. one where her son Matthew
[47:33] was s was laying because he went to
[47:36] retrieve his father in this fire and
[47:39] they stumbled and fell and he was in one
[47:43] hospital and brother brother Spencer in
[47:46] the other
[47:48] and I got so burned. Now sitting in my
[47:50] study is exactly how it happened.
[47:54] sitting in my study.
[47:57] I wanted to go and be at brother Ron's
[47:59] bedside, but I wasn't able to go.
[48:02] And the Holy Spirit came on me and said,
[48:06] "Call Sister Connie." And I knew that
[48:09] Sister Connie was not home. I knew that
[48:13] she was at his hospital. And I knew that
[48:16] they weren't able to take a call there,
[48:18] but I was so compelled and I just I
[48:22] picked up the phone and the only number
[48:23] I had was her home number and I knew she
[48:28] wasn't at home. But that's where you
[48:29] have to just cast down reasoning and do
[48:31] what the spirit is telling you to do. I
[48:34] picked up the phone, called the home
[48:35] phone, it rang maybe twice, and Sister
[48:38] Connie picked up the phone. My first
[48:41] words was, "Sister Connie, where are
[48:44] you? She said, "I'm between hospitals.
[48:47] I've just left the one hospital. I'm on
[48:50] my way to Ron's hospital." And I said,
[48:54] "God has so burdened me. I'm so
[48:57] burdened. I'm burdened for you. You
[49:00] don't have your husband. You don't have
[49:02] your son. Your husband's hanging between
[49:05] life and death." I said, "Sister Connie,
[49:08] I want you to take a message. I
[49:10] understand from a medical people that
[49:13] the last of the human senses to depart
[49:16] the body is the hearing. I've had
[49:19] experiences of that before. I said, "And
[49:22] you take and I want you to speak in
[49:25] brother Ron's ear and tell him that we
[49:29] have just purchased a camp and he's
[49:32] going to preach there next year." And go
[49:35] and tell him that in his ear. And as he
[49:38] said night before last, Sister Connie
[49:41] came and spoke those words in his ear
[49:44] while he was yet unconscious.
[49:46] I say you young people, you as a
[49:50] congregation are sitting here tonight
[49:53] not only witnessing a miracle, but you
[49:56] are participating in that miracle
[49:59] because God has called you to be here.
[50:03] Let's say praise be to God.
[50:06] Hallelujah.
[50:09] Hallelujah.
[50:16] And what you see now on the screen is
[50:18] him about 45 days later.
[50:21] Within about a month and a half,
[50:24] God had healed him and raised him up the
[50:27] way he is right now. And I I appreciate
[50:30] your clapping. I think it's good to give
[50:32] a clap to the Lord, but I really think
[50:35] the Lord would like to hear your voice
[50:36] and say, "Praise the Lord."
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give him praise.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; To God be the glory. Great things he has
[50:47] done.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:55] Be the glory.
[51:02] Let's stand to our
[51:03] &gt;&gt; feet
[51:14] for sing and hope
[51:19] and all.
[51:22] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let
[51:26] the earth hear his voice. Praise the
[51:30] Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the people
[51:36] rejoice.
[51:37] Oh, come to the father through Jesus the
[51:43] son and give him the glory. Great things
[51:49] he has done. Before we sing the chorus
[51:52] again, I'm going to ask the deacons to
[51:54] come forward.
[51:56] We're going to receive an offering this
[51:58] evening again and tomorrow will be your
[52:01] tithes and offerings. This is for the
[52:03] expense of the camp. Bring us your
[52:06] speaker, brother Ron Spencer here and
[52:10] his wife. We're so happy to have them
[52:13] here. And I know that you want to play a
[52:15] part. I don't care what you give, but
[52:18] you open up your heart and say, "Lord,
[52:19] what would you have me to give?"
[52:24] God loves a cheerful giver.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Are we cheerful givers tonight? Of
[52:29] course we are. You've been giving and
[52:32] giving of yourself. Amen.
[52:37] Let's just sing the chorus once again.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let
[52:45] the earth his voice. Praise the Lord.
[52:50] Praise the Lord. Let the people Oh,
[52:56] come to the father through Jesus the son
[53:02] and give him the glory. Great things he
[53:07] has done.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads as we ask God's
[53:12] blessing upon our giving. Dear heavenly
[53:15] father, we've taken these few extra
[53:17] moments to have another look at the
[53:22] miracle that you have done. We speak
[53:25] Lord of miracles of the past, but this
[53:28] is something that is current. This is
[53:31] something that is right before us. Here
[53:34] we had our brother Ron Spencer last year
[53:38] and shortly after that meeting he was
[53:41] struck down. We know that Satan tried to
[53:45] take his life. We're convinced of that.
[53:48] But we're more convinced that you
[53:50] stepped in the way and you refused it.
[53:54] You refused the enemy this advance. You
[53:57] stopped him in his tracks. YOU CAST HIM
[54:00] BACK AND YOU BROUGHT our brother out, oh
[54:03] God. And we're giving you praise. We're
[54:06] so thankful tonight that we're able to
[54:08] give in support of the great work of
[54:11] God. And Lord, as we seek to make this
[54:14] camp a facility, a place where the bride
[54:18] of Jesus Christ could come, Lord, Lord,
[54:22] I pray that you'll be pleased with
[54:24] everything that takes place here.
[54:26] Forgive us of our weaknesses and our
[54:28] wrongs. Oh Lord, if there's anything
[54:30] that would be displeasing to you, remove
[54:32] it from us, oh God. We just want you to
[54:35] be glorified and your name to be lifted
[54:37] up and that the kingdom of Christ Jesus
[54:40] will be advanced. We thank you now in
[54:43] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[54:47] bless you as you have your seats and the
[54:49] deacons move forward and and take up the
[54:51] offering. Brother Rod, I wonder if you
[54:53] could just sing a chorus with us. You do
[54:55] that.
[54:58] Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Let's sing.
[55:00] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that
[55:02] is within me. Bless his holy name.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord,
[55:10] oh my soul,
[55:13] and all
[55:15] that is within me. Bless his holy
[55:21] bless his holy
[55:25] name.
[55:29] I will bless the Lord.
[55:34] Oh my soul and all that is within me.
[55:41] Bless his holy name. Bless his holy
[55:48] name.
[55:50] He has done great things.
[55:54] He has done great things.
[55:59] He has done great things. So many great
[56:04] things. He has done great things.
[56:09] Bless his holy holy.
[56:13] He's done great things. He has done
[56:18] great things.
[56:22] He has done great things.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; So many great things.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; He has done great things.
[56:31] Bless him.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Well, I will bless the Lord.
[56:40] Oh my soul and all that is within me.
[56:47] Bless his holy.
[56:51] Bless his holy
[56:54] name.
[56:59] Bless the Lord.
[57:01] Oh my soul and all that is within me.
[57:08] Blessings
[57:10] holy. Bless is holy.
[57:15] Sing it one more time. Bless the Lord.
[57:20] Bless the Lord.
[57:23] Oh my soul and all
[57:27] that is within me. Bless his holy
[57:34] bless his holy
[57:37] name.
[57:40] Oh, I will bless the Lord.
[57:45] Oh my soul and all that is within me.
[58:06] Amen.
[58:10] Brother Ron Spencer,
[58:13] a miracle of the grace of God.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And I know one I don't know all the
[58:19] reason God raised him off that bed you
[58:21] just saw.
[58:23] But I do know one major reason. That's
[58:26] so he could stand behind this pulpit
[58:28] tonight
[58:29] &gt;&gt; and speak words from God
[58:32] &gt;&gt; to your heart and soul. And we're here,
[58:37] &gt;&gt; are we not?
[58:39] We ready?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Love the Lord this evening.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; He's certainly good to us, isn't he?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; I would uh
[58:59] I would like to have my two sons to come
[59:01] up here tonight. I want to
[59:04] I want to show share them with you.
[59:25] This is brother Matthew here and brother
[59:28] Andrew.
[59:30] Brother Matthew was felt felt to come
[59:33] and see his daddy at about 9:30 almost
[59:37] 10 o'clock at night to bring sister
[59:39] Whitney some graph paper.
[59:43] Everything is predestinated by God.
[59:47] And brother Matthew had arrived just
[59:49] only seconds before the explosion.
[59:52] And I thank God for every pound of him.
[1:00:07] I had on bib overhauls and I fell in the
[1:00:09] explosion and and he literally said he
[1:00:12] just grabbed me like that and just
[1:00:14] tugged me and went running with me and
[1:00:17] probably my feet didn't even hit the
[1:00:19] ground.
[1:00:20] But without that, we know God is a
[1:00:23] miracle working God. And and God
[1:00:26] anointed him for that challenge of that
[1:00:28] moment. And uh Brother Andrew quickly
[1:00:32] moved quickly and got us to the rescue
[1:00:34] squad and got me in the in the truck.
[1:00:36] And so I want to give them a great big
[1:00:38] hand this evening.
[1:00:57] We have a young daughter here. She's 17
[1:01:00] years old. She's not old enough to be
[1:01:02] available just yet,
[1:01:10] but she w she as well as my
[1:01:12] daughter-in-laws were at Sister
[1:01:14] Conniey's side 100% of the time. My
[1:01:19] daughter never flinched.
[1:01:22] Connie said she never never said a
[1:01:24] negative word.
[1:01:26] She said, "Daddy has preached to always
[1:01:29] think positive and say positive things."
[1:01:34] Sister Whitney, will you stand up just
[1:01:36] now? Amen. Let's give her a great big
[1:01:38] hand this evening.
[1:01:49] And the little lady that whispered in my
[1:01:51] ear and put Brother Brandham's voice in
[1:01:53] my ear for a coma for almost three weeks
[1:01:59] with doctors telling her her husband
[1:02:01] wouldn't go wouldn't make it. She had
[1:02:04] faith to believe that God's going to
[1:02:06] raise him up.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; That phone call, Brother Ed, was just
[1:02:10] life sustaining. You just don't know
[1:02:12] what that meant to us. Sister Connie,
[1:02:15] will you stand? We certainly love her.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I learned never to play with
[1:02:32] matches again.
[1:02:35] Amen. We certainly thank the Lord for
[1:02:37] what he has done and and it
[1:02:42] those those horrid reminders of what we
[1:02:45] went through and uh we certainly thank
[1:02:50] the Lord that he has not only healed my
[1:02:52] body but he's healing my lungs and they
[1:02:55] have been quite a struggle. It destroyed
[1:02:58] about 75% of my lung capacity. But God
[1:03:02] is a miracle working God.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we just we just are so
[1:03:07] pleased that we can fulfill the vision
[1:03:10] of the word of the hour. And just as
[1:03:13] much as there was a silver tip grizzly
[1:03:15] bear and a 42in horns on an animal, I
[1:03:19] believe just as much as that same God
[1:03:22] spoke to brother Ed and said he will
[1:03:24] preach that meeting next year.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; The camp came, you came and I stand here
[1:03:32] tonight by the glory of God.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:38] Hallelujah.
[1:03:40] To God be the glory.
[1:03:46] Hallelujah.
[1:03:48] To God be the
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:07] Your scriptures with me tonight to St.
[1:04:09] Luke
[1:04:11] chapter 4.
[1:04:16] St. Luke chapter 4.
[1:04:22] Last night I was up in the wee hours of
[1:04:24] the morning in prayer. The Lord just
[1:04:27] visited me in a special way and I want
[1:04:30] to thank him for that
[1:04:35] because he is the important one in this
[1:04:37] building.
[1:04:38] Yes. Amen.
[1:04:41] St. Luke chapter 4.
[1:04:45] And let's just talk to the author of
[1:04:46] this book and ask him to speak to our
[1:04:49] hearts. How many of you will ask him to
[1:04:51] come to your your seat tonight? Ask him
[1:04:55] to come right where you're at.
[1:04:57] He's a personal God.
[1:05:00] Hallelujah. Just as much as he's been
[1:05:02] personal to me over the last week and
[1:05:04] months and year, he's a real personal
[1:05:06] God to you.
[1:05:08] Lord Jesus, we love you.
[1:05:12] I stand nervously behind this desk
[1:05:14] tonight
[1:05:16] and I am aware that you saw this before
[1:05:19] the foundation of the world
[1:05:21] and you allowed brother Ed to see and
[1:05:24] sense certain things about this camp
[1:05:27] Lord about how it would be constructed
[1:05:30] and how it would be laid out and now how
[1:05:33] the speaker would who he would be and
[1:05:36] Satan would like to have forthed all of
[1:05:39] all of that. But Lord, you're a great
[1:05:42] God.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're alive and well tonight.
[1:05:48] We still have a report of an empty tomb.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we thank you tonight
[1:05:54] that you would come and and in the midst
[1:05:57] of this congregation
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; and we're aware that you're here,
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Lord. Maybe it's not in our senses of of
[1:06:04] our flesh or even in our spirit, but
[1:06:06] Father, we're aware because your word
[1:06:09] says that you're here.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just have a super sense
[1:06:13] that just lets us know that you are in
[1:06:15] this building. And I pray that you would
[1:06:18] circumcise our hearts, our ears, our
[1:06:21] tongue tonight.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, may you give us a temporary
[1:06:25] resurrection
[1:06:26] through which you can speak through us.
[1:06:28] And may we be a microphone and ears to
[1:06:32] hear your word and may you channel it
[1:06:34] towards our needs, our soul. And Lord, I
[1:06:38] pray that you would come and speak to
[1:06:40] us.
[1:06:42] May it be not the mind of a man, but may
[1:06:44] you speak to us tonight. We thank you
[1:06:47] for these things that you have laid upon
[1:06:50] my heart in Jesus Christ's name. We
[1:06:52] thank you. Amen and amen and amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; St. Luke chapter 4 and verse 16. This
[1:07:00] evening,
[1:07:06] I would like to look tonight at a
[1:07:08] released word.
[1:07:12] And he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:07:14] been brought up. And as his custom was,
[1:07:16] he went into the synagogue on the
[1:07:18] Sabbath day and stood up for to read.
[1:07:21] And there unto him the book of the
[1:07:23] prophet Isaiah.
[1:07:26] And when he had opened the book, he
[1:07:29] found the place where it was written,
[1:07:32] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me,
[1:07:34] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:07:36] the gospel to the poor. And he has sent
[1:07:39] me to heal the
[1:07:42] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:07:44] and the recovering of the sight to the
[1:07:46] blind, and to set at liberty them that
[1:07:48] are bruised, and to preach the
[1:07:50] acceptable year of the Lord." And he
[1:07:53] closed the book, and he gave it again to
[1:07:56] the minister, and sat down. And the eyes
[1:07:58] of all of them that were in the
[1:08:00] synagogue were fastened on him. And he
[1:08:02] be to say unto them, "This day is this
[1:08:06] scripture fulfilled in your ears." And
[1:08:10] all that bear him witness wondered at
[1:08:13] the gracious words which proceeded out
[1:08:15] of his mouth, and they said, "Is not
[1:08:19] this Joseph's son? and you may be seated
[1:08:22] this afternoon.
[1:08:32] We realize that words can have power
[1:08:36] that goes with them.
[1:08:38] We realize that every word is a seed of
[1:08:41] potential and when it it's released and
[1:08:43] and brother Brandham says certain light
[1:08:46] is released in every age and there's a
[1:08:48] certain amount of light that is released
[1:08:50] and and we realize that that many times
[1:08:54] as the prophets would speak maybe they
[1:08:57] did not understand what they were saying
[1:08:59] and and even when they were saying those
[1:09:02] words maybe inspiration would hit them
[1:09:04] and maybe they wouldn't understand it
[1:09:06] and maybe they would never see the
[1:09:08] fulfillment of it.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Such as Psalms chapter 22 when he begins
[1:09:12] to proclaim out, "My God, my God, why
[1:09:15] hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou far
[1:09:19] from helping me and from the words of my
[1:09:21] roaring? Oh my God, I cry in the
[1:09:24] daytime, but thou hearest not. And in
[1:09:26] the night season, and am not silent,
[1:09:30] they g upon me, their mouths in a raver
[1:09:32] and a roaring line. I am poured out like
[1:09:34] water and all my bones are out of joint.
[1:09:37] My heart is like wax. It is melted in my
[1:09:40] of my boughs and my strength is dried up
[1:09:42] like a pop shear and the tongue cleaveth
[1:09:45] to my jaws and thou has brought me into
[1:09:47] the dust of the death. For dogs have
[1:09:50] compassed me. The the assembly of the
[1:09:52] wicked have enclosed me. They pierced my
[1:09:54] hands and my feet. And David didn't
[1:09:56] realize THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT CALVARY
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS PROJECTING THOSE VOICES.
[1:10:02] NOTICE AS ISAIAH, HE BEGINS TO BE
[1:10:04] INSPIRED. FOR UNTO US A SON, a child IS
[1:10:08] BORN. UNTO US A SON IS GIVEN. AND THE
[1:10:11] GOVERNMENT SHALL BE UPON his shoulder.
[1:10:13] And his name shall be called Wonderful,
[1:10:16] Counselor, the mighty God, the
[1:10:19] everlasting FATHER, THE PRINCE OF PEACE.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Those words no doubt had been used many
[1:10:25] times before, but never in that
[1:10:27] collection or that gathering. But God in
[1:10:30] his great mind and all of his attributes
[1:10:33] knew what he was going to do upon the
[1:10:35] earth. So he allowed an ordained
[1:10:37] prophet, A PREDESTINATED PROPHET, an
[1:10:40] elected prophet to come on the scene at
[1:10:42] a certain season and he would come to a
[1:10:45] certain maturity in his life and he
[1:10:47] would stand under the inspiration OF GOD
[1:10:50] ENTRUSTED WITH A certain characteristic
[1:10:53] and he would begin to proceed things out
[1:10:55] of his lips and not even from his mind.
[1:10:59] UNTO US A CHILD is given.
[1:11:05] No doubt many of rabbi, many of priests
[1:11:08] would look at those scriptures and maybe
[1:11:11] take them for a text or a theme of a
[1:11:14] sermon. We're looking unto something.
[1:11:17] We're looking into a certain day. But
[1:11:19] brother Brandham said in Mary's belief
[1:11:21] he said on a certain day a rabbi stood
[1:11:24] up for to read and he said Joseph of
[1:11:27] Mary was sitting in the congregation and
[1:11:30] they begin to hear the words as it
[1:11:32] proceeded out of the rabbis out of the
[1:11:35] rabbi's mouth. Now once again these are
[1:11:38] powerful words and these words have
[1:11:41] circled the earth for hundreds of years
[1:11:44] and as they've circled the word the
[1:11:46] world for hundreds of years NO DOUBT
[1:11:48] LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MEN THOUSANDS OF
[1:11:51] MEN HAVE UTTERED THESE WORDS.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; But on this day
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; and at this season of time THIS MAN
[1:12:00] FEELS INSPIRED TO GO TO THIS passage of
[1:12:03] scripture. A SCRIPTURE THAT HAS
[1:12:05] INCREDIBLE POWER to it. And young lady
[1:12:08] SITTING IN THE CONGREGATION, HEARD THE
[1:12:11] WORD AND SOMETHING STRUCK INSIDE OF HER
[1:12:13] HEART.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT MANY WANTED TO BE THAT PART.
[1:12:20] MANY DESIRED TO BE THAT PART, BUT THERE
[1:12:23] WAS ONE PREDESTINATED WOMB THAT WOULD
[1:12:27] FULFILL THAT PART.
[1:12:31] Brother Brandham said the next day she
[1:12:34] at that afternoon said they'd went home
[1:12:36] and they pulled out the scripture and
[1:12:39] they rolled the scroll out and they read
[1:12:41] it again and IT SAID AS THEY SAT THERE
[1:12:44] in the evening sun was going down they
[1:12:47] begin to think on these things and
[1:12:49] something just burned within her heart.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; He said it WAS ON THE NEXT DAY THAT AN
[1:12:54] ANGEL came and met her.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; We believe that don't we?
[1:13:00] Because we too live in another age.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Not only did Mary get an angelic
[1:13:07] visitation,
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; but I have received an angelic
[1:13:15] visitation.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Before the great AND THE DREADFUL DAY OF
[1:13:21] the Lord, hallelujah, God sent Ron
[1:13:25] Spencer, an angel.
[1:13:30] Are you with me now?
[1:13:35] There they sat in the tabernacle in the
[1:13:37] synagogue.
[1:13:40] And no doubt
[1:13:43] as Jesus as his custom was, he went to
[1:13:46] church
[1:13:48] and he opened up the scripture
[1:13:51] word
[1:13:53] because in the beginning was the word
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; and the word was made flesh
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; and it dwelt among us
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; and he opened the word and he looked for
[1:14:02] his part to read
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; and he be to read the scriptures of
[1:14:07] which he is going to fulfill.
[1:14:10] And he begins to read, "The spirit of
[1:14:13] the Lord is upon me because he hath
[1:14:16] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:14:18] poor. He has sent me to heal the
[1:14:21] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[1:14:23] the captives and recovering of the sight
[1:14:25] to the blind, to sit at liberty them
[1:14:27] that are bruised, to preach the
[1:14:30] acceptable year of the Lord." And he be
[1:14:33] to say once he closed this book, "This
[1:14:37] day, this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:14:41] ears."
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; SOME SAID, "THIS IS JOSEPH'S SON."
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THEY HAD LOOKED FOR IT FOR
[1:14:49] HUNDREDS OF YEARS.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD THEY HAD WANTED THIS TIME,
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; BUT IT DIDN'T COME THE WAY THAT THEY
[1:14:58] thought it would come.
[1:15:00] How powerful her words.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln was in New Orleans
[1:15:09] and as he was standing beside a boat
[1:15:11] that was
[1:15:13] people to be sold.
[1:15:16] He watched an incredible scene that
[1:15:18] would have a great effect in his life. I
[1:15:21] was actually going to go to the quote
[1:15:23] that brother Ed just read. I'll leave it
[1:15:25] alone.
[1:15:27] It's incredible powerful. I like how God
[1:15:29] does business.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; But he was molded by two books,
[1:15:34] Pilgrim's Progress
[1:15:36] and the Bible. And with that kind of
[1:15:40] character standing there, he had lost 11
[1:15:43] o times to win a public office. But God
[1:15:47] wasn't done because he failed 11 times.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I FAILED OVER AND
[1:15:56] OVER AND OVER AGAIN." GOD'S NOT
[1:15:57] FINISHED. JUST BECAUSE YOU FAILED a few
[1:16:00] times in your life.
[1:16:04] And he stood beside THAT BOAT AND HE
[1:16:06] WATCHED PEOPLE be sold. AND HE SAID, "NO
[1:16:09] MAN SHOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD into slavery.
[1:16:12] We're all created equal."
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Brown, white, black,
[1:16:17] yellow, we're all equal."
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; We all came from Adam. Hey, I WANT YOU
[1:16:24] TO UNDERSTAND TONIGHT here he stood and
[1:16:27] SOMETHING BOSOMED INTO HIS HEART and he
[1:16:29] said, "IF IT COST ME MY BLOOD, I'M GOING
[1:16:32] TO PUT A STOP TO THIS."
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; This country became in a great crisis.
[1:16:38] It became in a split. And we recognized
[1:16:41] that Abraham Lincoln one day was to go
[1:16:43] and make a speech.
[1:16:45] And as he was on his train ride to
[1:16:48] Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,
[1:16:51] there was a man that stood in front of
[1:16:52] him AND PREACHED. HE SPOKE FOR TWO
[1:16:54] HOURS, A GREAT ORATOR. He was called one
[1:16:56] of the greatest orators of the whole
[1:16:58] day. And as HE STOOD THERE THAT DAY, HE
[1:17:02] BEGAN TO PREACH. As he began to speak,
[1:17:04] excuse me, AND HE SPOKE FOR TWO HOURS.
[1:17:07] Nobody hardly remembers anything that he
[1:17:09] had to say, nor do they even remember
[1:17:12] his name.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS MAN
[1:17:16] HAD PRAYED ON THE WAY IN that train and
[1:17:19] it HAS SPOKEN THAT HE HE DIDN'T have
[1:17:22] anything on his heart you know that you
[1:17:26] know that would move and he's PRAYED
[1:17:28] UNTO GOD
[1:17:30] HELP ME
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; GOD INSPIRE me
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; and HE STEPPED TO THE PODIUM THAT DAY A
[1:17:38] TALL slender man of face with rugged and
[1:17:42] chisel look AND HE STEPPED TO THAT PULL
[1:17:45] PIT, THAT PODIUM THAT DAY. AND SURE,
[1:17:48] THERE WERE PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
[1:17:49] FELT THE SAME WAY HE DID and said the
[1:17:52] same THINGS THAT HE DID. BUT THIS MAN
[1:17:55] WAS ORDAINED.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; This man was elected.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; THIS MAN WAS PLACED TO COME TO THAT
[1:18:03] POSITION. AND WHEN HE STEPPED TO THE
[1:18:06] PODIUM THAT DAY, THE WORLD DIDN'T
[1:18:08] RECOGNIZE WHAT KIND OF POWER THAT THIS
[1:18:11] MAN HAD WHEN HE SPOKE THE GETTYSBURG
[1:18:14] ADDRESS.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Though short, though quick, it was
[1:18:20] powerful.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; There was a man that was inspired in our
[1:18:29] day.
[1:18:31] His name was Martin Luther King.
[1:18:36] This man had a vision.
[1:18:38] He had a dream.
[1:18:42] And as like him or don't like him or or
[1:18:45] those things, brother Ram had many
[1:18:47] different things to say about him.
[1:18:50] But this man had something that was
[1:18:52] inspired in his soul. And he began to
[1:18:55] speak it forth
[1:18:57] because not all of us could drink at the
[1:18:59] same water fountain. Not all of us could
[1:19:02] drink and eat at the same restaurant.
[1:19:05] Not all of us could to stay at the same
[1:19:07] motel. But this man had a vision THAT IT
[1:19:11] SHOULDN'T stay that way.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; And so HE BEGIN TO PROJECT THIS VISION
[1:19:16] out that I have a dream.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; I have dream
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; that we can all be free.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; WE CAN ALL ENJOY FREEDOMS. AND HE BE TO
[1:19:29] SPEAK THIS OUT. AND THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE
[1:19:32] TURNED OUR NATION INSIDE OUT FOR QUITE A
[1:19:34] WHILE, IT BEGIN TO IT BE TO HAVE POWER.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT BE TO CAUSE US TO COME TO
[1:19:42] GRIP WITH OUR FEELINGS.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THOSE WORDS COMING FROM THAT
[1:19:47] MAN'S LIPS HAD INCREDIBLE POWER.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; And as you BEGIN TO SPEAK IT FORTH, I
[1:19:52] HAVE BEEN TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN. I
[1:19:55] HAVE LOOKED OUT OVER THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:19:58] And he began to project a vision to
[1:20:00] people.
[1:20:02] You see, he wasn't the only voice of
[1:20:04] this day.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; I have laid my foundation.
[1:20:14] When Jesus was standing there
[1:20:18] and he said, "My job is to preach the
[1:20:21] acceptable year of the Lord."
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:25] to set at liberty them that are captive.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; I have came to heal the brokenhearted.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand every devil
[1:20:36] that had challenged him at the mount of
[1:20:38] temptation
[1:20:39] knew when he echoed these things out of
[1:20:42] his lips.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; We have trouble now.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; A lot OF PEOPLE HAD QUOTED THESE WORDS.
[1:20:54] A lot of people HAD ALLOWED THOSE WORDS
[1:20:56] TO COME OFF OF THEIR LIPS.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A MAN.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; There had never been a man
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; THAT HAD STOOD TO HIS FEET
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; AND SAID THESE WORDS WITH NOT ONLY POWER
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; BUT SAME VOICE SAID, "LET THERE BE A
[1:21:16] SUN, MOON, AND STARS."
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS A SUN, MOON, AND STARS.
[1:21:23] THE SAME VOICE HAD SAID, ABRAHAM, I'M
[1:21:26] GOING TO HAVE A COVENANT BETWEEN YOU AND
[1:21:28] I.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I'M GOING TO RESTORE YOUR BODY.
[1:21:32] I'M GOING TO CHANGE YOUR NAME FROM ABRAM
[1:21:35] TO ABRAHAM.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO CHANGE YOUR WIFE'S NAME
[1:21:38] FROM SARAH TO SARAH, AND SHE'S GOING TO
[1:21:41] BE A PRINCESS WITH GOD. YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:21:43] HAVE A PROMISED SON, ABRAHAM,
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; AND HIS NAME IS GOING TO BE ISAAC.
[1:21:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; THAT SAME VOICE SPOKE TO NOAH, BUILD AN
[1:21:55] ARK. IT WAS THAT VOICE THAT WAS INSIDE
[1:21:59] OF THAT BODY.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It would CHANGE THE LIFE OF
[1:22:05] THE WOMAN AT THE WELL.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; IT WOULD CHANGE THE life of Legion.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; IT WOULD CHANGE THE LIFE OF LAZARUS.
[1:22:13] AMEN.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; DEATH WOULD NEVER BE LOOKED AT EVER THE
[1:22:17] SAME ONCE JESUS came to Lazarus's tomb.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Who was his biggest critic? Preachers.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Who is the biggest critics OF THE SON OF
[1:22:37] MAN AGAIN TODAY? PREACHERS.
[1:22:41] THEY BROUGHT HIM A WOMAN THAT WAS CAUGHT
[1:22:43] IN ADULTERY.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; LET'S SEE WHAT HE DOES WITH THE WORD.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; He said woman,
[1:22:53] he looked at all OF THEM THAT HE THAT IS
[1:22:55] WITHOUT sin
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; cast the first stone
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; because brother Ram says that NO MORTAL
[1:23:02] CAN STAND BEFORE another mortal
[1:23:05] IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND CONDEMN HIM.
[1:23:10] That's a powerful.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful thing.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; No mortal can stand before another
[1:23:17] mortal
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND CONDEMN HIM.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Did you get that?
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS BOWED ON HIS KNEES AND HE
[1:23:27] SAID, "HE THAT IS WITHOUT SIN, CAST THE
[1:23:29] FIRST STONE."
[1:23:31] And he be to write into the sand.
[1:23:35] And the scripture said that they WERE
[1:23:38] CONVICTED
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; BY THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; THE PRESENCE OF GOD, THEY WITH THEIR
[1:23:45] TURNAROUND CLOAKS and they're holier
[1:23:47] than holy.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; LOOK TO THEM NOW. THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[1:23:52] BEGINS TO DEAL ON THEIR hearts
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; and THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A CONDITION
[1:23:58] WE CAN'T THROW A STONE. AND JESUS LOOKED
[1:24:01] AT THE WOMAN, "WERE THINE ACCUSERS? I
[1:24:03] HAVE NONE.
[1:24:06] I have not.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; NEITHER DO I CONDEMN. THEY GO AND SIN NO
[1:24:12] MORE.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, JESUS WAS NOT A REHABILITATION
[1:24:19] CENTER.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; He was not a consultant service.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; But when THEY CAME INTO THE PRESENCE OF
[1:24:25] GOD,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; the woman AT THE WELL WAS NO LONGER A
[1:24:32] PROSTITUTE.
[1:24:34] THE WOMAN THAT WAS CAUGHT IN ADULTERY
[1:24:35] WAS NO LONGER A HARLOT.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY FOUND PETER, HE WAS NAKED and
[1:24:43] cursing. BUT WHEN JESUS GOT A HOLD OF
[1:24:46] HIM, HE WAS A KIND OF DISCIPLE THAT
[1:24:48] COULD BE THE SPOKESMAN ON ACTS CHAPTER
[1:24:50] 2.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; What kind of a man was this?
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Zachchariah said, "Oh, rejoice greatly,
[1:24:58] oh daughter of Zion.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Shout, oh daughter of Jerusalem. Behold,
[1:25:02] thy king cometh unto thee. He is just,
[1:25:05] and having salvation, lowly, and riding
[1:25:08] upon an ass, upon the colt, the fo of an
[1:25:10] ass. Psalms 11:18 says, "He is the stone
[1:25:14] which the builders refuse, has become
[1:25:16] the head of the corner." This is the
[1:25:18] Lord's doing. It is marvelous in our
[1:25:21] eyes. This is the day which the Lord has
[1:25:23] made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Save now I beseech thee, oh Lord. Oh
[1:25:28] Lord, I beseech thee send thou th now
[1:25:31] prosperity. Blessed is he that cometh in
[1:25:34] the name of the Lord. WE HAVE BLESSED
[1:25:36] YOU, OH HOUSE OF THE LORD.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Just the titles of our Lord Jesus.
[1:25:50] He was the anointed.
[1:25:53] He was beginning and the end of the
[1:25:54] creation of God. He was our blessed. HE
[1:25:58] WAS OUR BRIDEGROOM.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; He is the bread of life.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; He is the I am that I am.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; He is the CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S HOPE.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; He is the CHIEF CORNERSTONE.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; HE IS THE COMMANDER. He is THE
[1:26:12] CONSOLATION OF ISRAEL. HE IS THE
[1:26:14] CORNERSTONE. HE IS OUR COUNSELOR.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Every word of THESE WORDS HAS INCREDIBLE
[1:26:21] POWER.
[1:26:23] HOW MUCH WHEN MOSES WALKED IN, HE TURNED
[1:26:25] THE KINGDOM UPSIDE DOWN BY JUST SAYING,
[1:26:27] "I AM THAT I AM."
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. Love the Lord.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; He is the heir of all things. HE IS THE
[1:26:37] HEAD OF EVERY MAN.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; HE IS JEHOVAH'S FELLOW. HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; HE IS JESUS THE CHRIST.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:53] I want to kind of quickly turn towards
[1:26:57] you just now.
[1:27:00] Behold, I send you
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; before THE COMING OF THE GREAT AND THE
[1:27:09] dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall
[1:27:12] turn the heart
[1:27:14] of the fathers to the children and the
[1:27:16] heart of the children to the fathers,
[1:27:18] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[1:27:20] curse.
[1:27:22] Revelation chapter 3 said, "Behold, I
[1:27:24] stand at the door and knock, and if any
[1:27:27] man hear my voice and open the door, I
[1:27:30] will come into HIM AND WILL SUCK WITH
[1:27:32] him and he with me
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; to him that overcomemeth."
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. JESUS HAD TO LOOK AT
[1:27:41] THE WORD AND SEE WHAT IT SAID ABOUT HIM.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; I'D GOT TO LOOK AT THE WORD AND SEE WHAT
[1:27:46] IT SAYS ABOUT ME.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; To Ron Spencer that overcometh
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; in 2008,
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GRANT TO SIT WITH ME IN MY
[1:27:56] THRONE EVEN AS I HAVE OVERCAME AND I'M
[1:28:01] SAT down
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; with my father in his throne.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love the Lord?
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us?
[1:28:10] Brother Brandham said, "I WAS INSPIRED
[1:28:12] TO TAKE UP MY PEN and write."
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Now, remember, he's God's prophet. So,
[1:28:18] he's beginning to write down words that
[1:28:20] are going to release power.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Listen closely. Here's
[1:28:26] what I picked up my pen for." He said,
[1:28:27] "Did you see, friends, this I have stood
[1:28:30] the way that I have and I why I'm a
[1:28:32] contending." He says, "And get away from
[1:28:34] the denominations and the real CHURCH OF
[1:28:36] GOD." HE SAID, "SEE WHY IT'S GOT TO COME
[1:28:38] OUT OF THE WORD? It can't COME FROM THE
[1:28:41] WISDOM OF MAN. IT'S GOT TO COME BY THE
[1:28:43] WORD OF GOD. That's the reason I believe
[1:28:46] the WORD JUST THE WAY it's written. I
[1:28:48] won't add nothing to it or TAKE NOTHING
[1:28:50] AWAY FROM IT. JUST PREACH IT THAT WAY
[1:28:52] AND JUST KEEP it going." He said, HE
[1:28:55] SAID, "ALL RIGHT. NOW, HERE'S WHAT I'M
[1:28:56] TRYING TO SAY TO YOU. THE LAW OF
[1:28:58] REPRODUCTION BRINGS FORTH KIND after
[1:29:02] kind.
[1:29:04] SO IF GOD WANTS TO REPRODUCE HORSES,
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; he has horses. IF HE REPRODUCES COWS, HE
[1:29:12] HAS COWS.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; If he REPRODUCES CAMELS, HE REPRODUCES
[1:29:17] CAMELS. SO WHEN HE WANTS TO REPRODUCE
[1:29:20] HIMSELF HERE IN THIS LEOTAN AGE,
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; HE REPRODUCES MINIATURE GODS UPON THE
[1:29:29] EARTH.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Messiah on the earth.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; THE IMPORTANT PART OF YOU TONIGHT IS
[1:29:37] THAT LITTLE SPOT THAT IS DOWN ON THE
[1:29:39] INSIDE OF YOU
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; THAT BECOMES IGNITED BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:29:45] AND ONCE IGNITED, IT'LL SET THE WORLD ON
[1:29:47] FIRE. BROTHER SAID, "GOD'S STRATEGY IS
[1:29:51] EMPTY THE WORLD OUT OF YOU AND FILL YOU
[1:29:53] WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND THEN SHAKE THE
[1:29:56] THE WHOLE WORLD with it."
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; He said the law of reproduction brings
[1:30:04] forth kind of his kind. These last days,
[1:30:07] I suppose that would be these days.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; These last days. If you don't think
[1:30:13] we're in the last days, just pay
[1:30:15] attention to the news for five minutes.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Earthquakes,
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Sodom and Gomorrah,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; governments are falling, BANKS ARE
[1:30:26] FALLING, MONEY IS FALLING,
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; jobs are falling,
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; education's at its end.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, I'M IN MY SECURITY ZONE. I
[1:30:38] GOT NEWS FOR YOU. MONEY'S NOT YOUR
[1:30:40] SECURITY. That's right. COME ON.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; JOBS IS NOT YOUR SECURITY.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. FRIENDS OUT THERE ARE NOT
[1:30:47] YOUR SECURITY BLANKET.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU, THERE'S ONLY ONE REFUGE
[1:30:51] WE CAN RUN TO TONIGHT, AND THAT IS INTO
[1:30:54] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:59] I'm not planning on staying here for THE
[1:31:01] TRIBULATION PERIOD. I'M PLANNING ON
[1:31:03] TAKING A RAPTURE.
[1:31:08] WE HAVE A WORD THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED IN
[1:31:10] THIS EVENING. NOW,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT RELEASED BY THE MIND of a man.
[1:31:16] BROTHER SAID, "YOU'RE NOT FEEDING ON THE
[1:31:17] WORD, THE MIND OF A MAN. YOU'RE FEEDING
[1:31:20] ON THE BODY WORD OF THE SON OF MAN."
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS WAS NOT THIS IS NOT WILLIAM
[1:31:27] BRANDHAM'S MESSAGE. THIS WAS GOD'S
[1:31:29] MESSAGE.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT WILLIAM BRANDHAM'S WIFE.
[1:31:34] WE'RE GOD'S WIFE.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:37] HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE VOICE THAT IS
[1:31:44] BEHIND THE VOICE.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LAMBS WHEN
[1:31:49] THAT ANGEL SCREAMED, "WHO IS WORTHY TO
[1:31:52] TAKE THE BOOK?"
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, OUR NAMES WERE WRITTEN IN THAT
[1:31:57] BOOK.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU WERE 50 YEARS OLD AND 80
[1:32:00] YEARS OLD, AND SOME OF YOU ARE SITTING
[1:32:02] HERE TONIGHT 12 AND 15 YEARS OLD. BUT
[1:32:05] THE LAMB STEPPED FORTH AND TOOK THE
[1:32:08] BOOK.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; HE REDEEMED YOU.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; HE REDEEMED YOU. WHEN YOU COULDN'T
[1:32:15] REDEEM YOURSELF, HE STEPPED FORTH FOR
[1:32:18] THE TITLE D BOOK.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; NOW, the accuser of the brethren had
[1:32:28] wrote a lot of things down that was
[1:32:30] against you.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; But I want to remind you, HE'S A LIAR.
[1:32:38] HE IS A PERVERTER.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; He has perverted this world. He has
[1:32:42] perverted the theology.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; HE HAS TRANSFORMED HIMSELF AS AN ANGEL
[1:32:47] OF LIES. HE'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST
[1:32:49] PREACHERS THAT THERE IS IN THE WHOLE
[1:32:50] WIDE WORLD.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; He preached in Eden. HE HAS PREACHED IN
[1:32:54] SATAN'S EDEN.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; I REFUSE TO BELIEVE HIS LIE.
[1:33:04] HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; OH, don't you love the Lord? Tonight,
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; he said these last days, the true church
[1:33:13] bride comes to the headstone
[1:33:16] will be A SUPER CHURCH,
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; A SUPER RACE.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; NOW, there's been brides brides.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; There's been a lot of wannabes.
[1:33:32] You remember what I said when we first
[1:33:34] started out? A lot of people SAID THE
[1:33:36] SAME THING ISAIAH DID.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; A lot of rabbis got up and read.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; A lot of men said, "I'm the Christ."
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; But there was one coming.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; A LOT OF PREACHERS SAYS, "I'M I'M I'M
[1:33:53] Malachi 45 and six."
[1:33:56] A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT I'M THE PROPHET
[1:33:58] OF THE LAST DAYS,
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE HAD ONE.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; When he STOOD AT THE HOUSTON DEBATE AND
[1:34:07] THE ANGEL SAID, "GO ON DOWN."
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL WAS CHALLENGING HIM THERE
[1:34:14] THAT DAY.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; God likes a challenge.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; AND HE STOOD THERE THAT DAY AND THE
[1:34:23] PHOTOGRAPHER KEPT CLICKING. BUT GOD
[1:34:25] WANTED HIS PICTURE TAKEN.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED HIS WIFE TO HAVE HIS PICTURE.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; He wanted US TO BE ABLE TO HANG HIS
[1:34:38] PICTURE IN OUR CHURCHES,
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; in our homes, in our bedrooms, in our
[1:34:44] living rooms, carried around in our
[1:34:46] billfolds. THIS IS A PICTURE OF MY
[1:34:48] HUSBAND.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:54] A lot of people WANT TO SHOW THEIR
[1:34:56] FAMILY ALBUM. I'VE GOT A FAMILY ALBUM,
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; not only of the earthly, BUT I'VE GOT
[1:35:01] ONE OF THE HEAVENLY AS WELL. I HAVE MY
[1:35:04] PICTURE OF MY HUSBAND.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I'm excited.
[1:35:14] Listen,
[1:35:18] when these words are projected,
[1:35:21] NO DOUBT SATAN WAS WATCHING THESE WORDS.
[1:35:28] NO DOUBT HE HAD WALKED INTO THE
[1:35:30] METHODIST camp meetings and the Baptist
[1:35:33] camp meetings and the Pentecostal camp
[1:35:36] meetings
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; and he had heard their voices
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; and they had had their revivals in their
[1:35:41] day
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; and he had HAD TO BRING IN PERVERSION.
[1:35:47] SO HE ONCE AGAIN TRIES TO COME AND
[1:35:49] PERVER PERVERT THE WORD.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS A BRIDE ON THE SINK
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; THAT REFUSES THE THE PERVERSION.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; SHE SAYS, "GIVE IT TO ME PURE. I CAN
[1:36:03] HANDLE IT."
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; GIVE IT TO ME PURE. I CAN HANDLE IT.
[1:36:09] HE SAYS THEY WILL LOVE HIM AND HAVE HIS
[1:36:12] POTENTIALS
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; FOR FOR HE IS THEIR HEAD AND THEY ARE
[1:36:17] HIS SUBJECT SUBJECT TO THE HEAD SUBJECT
[1:36:20] TO THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Notice what harmony Jesus never did
[1:36:26] anything until he seen the father or the
[1:36:28] father showed him first.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; It's just like this. Sometimes we just
[1:36:34] need to be very careful, be very
[1:36:36] confident in what God is doing.
[1:36:40] No wonder Brother Brandon could be so
[1:36:42] confident and say, "Write this down on
[1:36:43] the fly leaf of your Bible."
[1:36:47] And two years later, he'd be on the
[1:36:49] Russian Finnish border.
[1:36:54] As I said last night standing there,
[1:36:58] "You call me a false prophet if this
[1:37:00] little boy is not off of the ground in
[1:37:02] five minutes.
[1:37:05] There's not another preacher in the
[1:37:06] whole world
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; that will say that.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; I challenge you. There's not another
[1:37:15] preacher in the whole world
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; that will say that.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; But it was the SAME KIND OF VOICE THAT
[1:37:22] SPOKE TO THE SEA.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And they SAID, "NEVER A MAN SPAKE LIKE
[1:37:30] THIS MAN."
[1:37:32] IT WAS THE SAME KIND OF VOICE THAT SPOKE
[1:37:34] TO LAZARUS.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; NOW HE'S HERE IN BRIDE FORM.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH, I'M GOING TO
[1:37:44] BIND IN HEAVEN. WHATEVER YOU LOOSE ON
[1:37:47] EARTH, I'M going to loose in heaven.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; And if ye abide in me and my WORDS ABIDE
[1:37:52] IN YOU, ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND IT SHALL
[1:37:56] BE DONE UNTO YOU.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; WHO YOU TALKING TO, BROTHER RON? YOU
[1:38:00] WHEN YOU GO ON YOUR KNEES,
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; YOU SHAKE THE KINGDOMS OF HELL.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; What was he trying TO DO TO ME? SHUT ME
[1:38:12] UP.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; CUZ SATAN DON'T LIKE SERMONS LIKE THIS.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; WHY WAS HE TRYING TO BUY BROTHER
[1:38:22] BRANDHAM OFF? CUZ HE DIDN'T LIKE SERPENT
[1:38:24] SEAT.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; He didn't LIKE TO BE EXPOSED.
[1:38:30] HE DIDN'T LIKE REVELATION 17 BEING
[1:38:32] OPENED UP WHO THE MOTHER OF HARLOT IS.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; THAT GREAT HERSELF. OH, MOTHER
[1:38:38] ROME.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; But that didn't bother the church WORLD
[1:38:41] SO MUCH UNTIL HE PREACHED WHY I'M
[1:38:43] AGAINST DENOMINATIONS.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; AND HE OPENED HIS LITTLE BIBLE AND HE
[1:38:48] OPENED UP TO READ. NO DOUBT THE DEVIL
[1:38:50] THOUGHT WHEN HE BE TO SPEAK THOSE WORDS
[1:38:54] ACROSS THE PULLPIT, I HAVE TROUBLE.
[1:39:08] I have trouble
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; when he preaches sermons like
[1:39:13] blasphemous names.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; I have trouble.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; I hope he SAYS THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU.
[1:39:31] WHEN you roll out of bed in the morning
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; and you open your little eyelids and you
[1:39:37] roll up OUT OF BED AND YOU'RE STANDING
[1:39:39] ON THE FLOOR AND YOU SAY, "THANK YOU,
[1:39:40] JESUS, FOR ANOTHER DAY."
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; When you recognize that you will not sit
[1:39:46] HERE TO BE TORMENTED BY THE DEVIL, BUT
[1:39:49] YOU ARE A SON OF GOD. THE SCRIPTURE
[1:39:51] SAYS, "NOW ARE WE THE SONS OF GOD?" NOT
[1:39:55] WILL BE, may be, someday might be, SOME
[1:39:58] DREAM SOMEWHERE OTHER. BUT RIGHT NOW, WE
[1:40:01] HAVE recognized
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; that WE ARE THE VERY SPOKEN WORD OF GOD,
[1:40:06] THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD, THE PHYSICAL
[1:40:09] LIVING ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ON THE EARTH.
[1:40:11] AND HERE WE STAND.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SEE ONE OF GOD'S THOUGHTS?
[1:40:17] HERE IT IS.
[1:40:25] HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; I STAND HERE IN VICTORY TONIGHT.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE HOUSES ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES
[1:40:33] OF GOD THAT HE THOUGHT OF BEFORE THE
[1:40:36] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you shouldn't get so
[1:40:47] excited.
[1:40:51] People can go to a ball game
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; and they will jump, shout, jump all over
[1:40:59] themselves.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; They'll take their coats OFF AND STAND
[1:41:05] IN sub-zero degree weather.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; THEY'LL BEAT EACH OTHER OVER THE HEAD.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; THEY'LL SCREAM TO THE TOP OF THEIR
[1:41:13] LUNGS.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; THEY'LL BE HORSEARO ON MONDAY MORNING.
[1:41:19] They'll spend all their money on the
[1:41:20] weekends.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; THEY GET SO EXCITED. THEY'RE SO
[1:41:25] THRILLED.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; WE COME TO CHURCH. THIS IS THE ETERNAL
[1:41:29] PART.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; When a guy RUNS A TOUCHDOWN, IT DOESN'T
[1:41:41] SAVE ME ONE BIT.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T BOTHER MY SLEEP EITHER WAY.
[1:41:47] WHEN A GUY HITS A THREEPOINT CONVERSION
[1:41:49] OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THAT THING, IT
[1:41:51] DOESN'T BOTHER ME ONE LITTLE BIT. WHEN
[1:41:54] TIGER WOODS GETS A HOLE IN ONE, THAT
[1:41:56] DOESN'T EXCITE ME ONE LITTLE BIT. BUT
[1:41:58] WHEN I GET TO THINKING ABOUT JESUS,
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; oh hallelujah.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; BROTHER ROD, THAT'S WHAT WE SING ABOUT.
[1:42:17] THAT'S WHAT WE PRAISE THE LORD ABOUT.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M THANKFUL FOR WHAT HE DID
[1:42:22] AT THE WOMAN AT THE WELL. I'M THANKFUL
[1:42:24] FOR WHAT HE DID THROUGH COLUMBUS DAY AND
[1:42:26] IREINIUS'S DAY. AND I TELL YOU, I'M
[1:42:29] THANKFUL FOR WHAT HE DID WITH MARTIN
[1:42:30] LUTHER AND JOHN WESLEY. BUT I'M SO
[1:42:34] THANKFUL.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; I am so thankful.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; HE IS MY HUSBAND AND I WANT TO WORSHIP
[1:42:45] HIM.
[1:42:50] HE WAS ANOINTED ABOVE ALL THE FELLOWS.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; ALL THE PROPHETS HAD TO STAND THERE.
[1:42:56] NONE OF THEM COULD SAVE YOU AND I. MOSES
[1:42:59] COULDN'T SAVE ME.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; MOSES, AS POWERFUL AS HE WAS, HE
[1:43:05] COULDN'T SAVE ME.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; JONAH COULDN'T SAVE ME. LISTEN, I WANT
[1:43:09] YOU TO KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM COULDN'T
[1:43:10] SAVE ME.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; BUT ONE STEP FROM THE MIDST OF THE
[1:43:13] THRONE,
[1:43:16] A lamb.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I can hear THE
[1:43:25] NOISE GOING DOWN THROUGH THE STREETS. AN
[1:43:27] OLD CROSS BEATING ON THE COBBLESTONES.
[1:43:31] Bump bump bump bump bump down THROUGH
[1:43:35] THERE." HE SAID, "I CAN SEE HIS HIS
[1:43:37] ROBE." AND HE SAID, "IT STARTS OUT
[1:43:40] LITTLE BITTY SPOTS."
[1:43:42] HE SAID, "BUT THOSE SPOTS BEGIN TO GET
[1:43:44] BIGGER AND THEY GET BIGGER." HE'S
[1:43:47] STRUGGLING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE
[1:43:48] CROSS.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; He's struggling.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; No doubt. THERE WAS ANGELS SCREAMING,
[1:43:58] "JUST SPEAK TO US.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; JUST SPEAK TO US.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; JUST NOD YOUR HEAD. I'LL CHANGE THE
[1:44:05] SCENE."
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; LITTLE KIDS RAN OUT AND SPIT IN HIS
[1:44:09] FACE.
[1:44:11] THEY SPIT, BROTHER SAID, UNTIL IT RAN
[1:44:13] THROUGH HIS BEARD and ran off of him.
[1:44:16] But he was determined.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Determined.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; The scripture said, "He was wounded for
[1:44:28] my transgressions.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; HE WAS BRUISED FOR MY INIQUITIES."
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY TIED HIM TO THAT BEATING BLOCK
[1:44:35] THAT DAY,
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; HE WAS DETERMINED.
[1:44:39] WHEN RON SPENCER WAS GOING TO BE IN A
[1:44:41] BURN UNIT. I'M GONNA HEAL HIM.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; I'M GONNA HEAL HIM.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO WALK INTO HIS BURN ROOM
[1:44:52] UNIT.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; SATAN, YOU CAN'T DO IT. I'M GOING TO
[1:44:56] WALK IN THERE. THE DOCTORS WON'T SEE ME.
[1:44:59] THE NURSES WON'T SEE ME.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:11] OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to clean his lungs up.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO DESTROY HIM, BUT
[1:45:24] HE'S MY SON.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO HEAL HIS HANDS TO WHERE
[1:45:30] THEY HOLD THEY WORK COMPLETELY. I'M
[1:45:32] GOING TO HEAL HIS ARMS.
[1:45:36] I'M GOING TO HEAL HIS FACE TO WHERE HE
[1:45:38] WON'T EVEN HAVE A SPLOTCH ON IT.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; SATAN, YOU FOUL BREATH DEVIL.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; GET OUT OF THAT HOSPITAL ROOM.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; GEORGIA CARTER WAS RINGING HER WAS
[1:45:57] RINGING ALL THE STAIN OFF THE BED POST
[1:45:59] AND SHE WAS CRYING OUT TO GOD. AND WHEN
[1:46:02] THOSE DEVILS WERE BEATING ON HIS BODY,
[1:46:04] HE SAID, "GEORGIA, I'M GOING TO HEAL
[1:46:06] YOU."
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO HEAL YOU.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE,
[1:46:13] NO DOUBT, NO DOCTORS COULD HELP HER, BUT
[1:46:16] HE WAS SAYING, "FLORENCE, I'm going to
[1:46:19] heal you."
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Daddy, when you had cancer A FEW YEARS
[1:46:23] AGO AND THE DOCTOR SAID, "YOU GOT TO
[1:46:25] HAVE AN OPERATION." WHEN HE WHEN THEY
[1:46:28] WAS BEATING ON MY LORD, HE SAID,
[1:46:30] "CHARLIE,
[1:46:32] I've healed you.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; I'VE HEALED YOU, CHARLIE.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Ed,
[1:46:41] when you crinkle that neck over and you
[1:46:44] feel the pain,
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; he said, "Eddie, I've healed you.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; I've healed you.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Tom, I've healed you.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; I've healed you.
[1:47:02] I healed you. I healed you.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, BROTHER, I DOUBT THAT."
[1:47:17] WAIT JUST A MINUTE.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; I'M SURE YOU COULDN'T GET LAZARUS TO
[1:47:22] BELIEVE THAT JESUS WASN'T A HEALER.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN JESUS IS NOT A HEALER?
[1:47:29] I JUST GOT RESURRECTED FROM A GRAVE. I
[1:47:32] WAS SHAKING HANDS WITH ABRAHAM, ISAAC,
[1:47:34] and Jacob the other day.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; I was shaking their hands.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; I WAS SHAKING THEIR HANDS AND THEY WAS
[1:47:46] TELLING ME ABOUT MELAZDC WHEN HE CAME
[1:47:49] AND HE SPOKE TO HIM UNDER AN OAK TREE.
[1:47:51] WE HAD MEAT AND DRANK MILK AND HE SPOKE
[1:47:53] A VOICE AND IT CHANGED MY BODY.
[1:47:59] I HEARD A VOICE.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; LAZARUS.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT KNOWS MY
[1:48:12] VOICE, BUT THAT'S A VOICE.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A VOICE I COULD NEVER FORGET.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; LAZARUS, COME FORTH.
[1:48:28] The next thing I knew, I WAS WRAPPED IN
[1:48:30] GRAVE CLOTHES. I DON'T NEED GRAVE
[1:48:32] CLOTHES NO MORE.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; I don't need A BURN CENTER NO MORE.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; I don't need lung THERAPY NO MORE.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; HE'S A HEALER.
[1:48:55] Maybe you're sitting HERE TONIGHT AND
[1:48:57] THE DOCTOR'S TOLD YOU that the cancer is
[1:48:59] going to heat you up and you're going to
[1:49:01] die. YOU LOOK AT THAT DEVIL SAY YOU ARE
[1:49:03] A LIAR.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Arthritis is eating you up. You look at
[1:49:09] that rascal tonight and tell him it's a
[1:49:11] demon out of hell
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; and I don't have to put UP WITH YOU.
[1:49:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:17] SHAMGAR ONE DAY REALIZED, I AM A SON OF
[1:49:21] ABRAHAM.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; I don't HAVE TO PUT UP WITH YOU NO
[1:49:26] LONGER.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; I told you Satan was in for trouble
[1:49:45] tonight.
[1:50:00] I was going to go a complete different
[1:50:02] way and God dealt with me last night to
[1:50:04] go this way.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; What are you doing, Ron? I'll tell you
[1:50:10] what I'm doing. I'm doing what Papa said
[1:50:12] for me to do. I'm going to release some
[1:50:14] words
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; and you're going to hear some words.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; And you're going to say, "I'm getting UP
[1:50:25] OUT OF THIS BED."
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; There might be somebody on the internet
[1:50:28] TONIGHT THAT IS CLOSED IN a room
[1:50:30] somewhere another. And God is speaking
[1:50:32] to their life right now.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:41] You say, "Oh, Brother Ron, THIS WAS A
[1:50:42] HORRIBLE ACCIDENT THAT HAPPENED." I GOT
[1:50:44] NEWS FOR YOU TONIGHT. YOU MAY HAVE BROKE
[1:50:47] YOUR LEGS, BUT GOD IS STILL THE HEALER.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; You may HAVE BROKE YOUR ARMS, BUT GOD IS
[1:50:53] STILL THE HEALER.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says this, "I now challenge
[1:50:58] the devil to a debate.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Satan, you are aware that you are
[1:51:02] whipped.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; You have no legal rights. Jesus Christ,
[1:51:06] my Lord, STRIPPED YOU OF EVERY AUTHORITY
[1:51:10] YOU HAD WHEN HE DIED AT CALVARY TO TAKE
[1:51:13] AWAY SINS.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; And you're nothing but a bluff. AND
[1:51:18] WE'RE CALLING YOUR BLUFF.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW that when our LORD CAME TO TO
[1:51:22] THE TREE, HE CURSED THE TREE. THE next
[1:51:25] day it was withering. AND OUR LORD SAID
[1:51:27] HIS TO HIS DISCIPLES, "HAVE FAITH IN
[1:51:29] GOD. FOR HE SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN, BE
[1:51:32] THOU REMOVED. DON'T DOUBT IN YOUR HEART,
[1:51:34] BUT BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE SAID. IT IS
[1:51:36] COMING TO PASS.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE SAID.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT JUST TO THE DISCIPLES.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAM SAID, "WHEN GOD GIVES YOU,
[1:51:49] WHEN YOU BECOME A CHRISTIAN, GOD GIVES
[1:51:51] YOU A CHECKBOOK
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; AND IT HAS UNLIMITED FUNDS.
[1:52:09] Let me explain to you unlimited.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Tom looks over at Sister Joanne and HE
[1:52:20] SAYS, "GO SPEND WHAT YOU WANT."
[1:52:26] AND SISTER JOANNE GOES WITH SISTER LINDA
[1:52:28] AND THEY GO ON a buying spree.
[1:52:31] THEY BUY THREE CADILLACS, TWO TOYOTAS,
[1:52:34] and four Mercedes-Benz.
[1:52:37] And they come back IN AND THEY SAY,
[1:52:38] "HONEY, we're so sorry, but we just got
[1:52:40] excited."
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "WAIT A MINUTE. YOU DON'T
[1:52:45] UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF UNLIMITED.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR
[1:52:52] SPENDING.
[1:53:01] I seen you there.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; He was saying, "Don't you pay no
[1:53:05] attention to this.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; It is we who limit God.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; NEVER HAVE A NEGATIVE THOUGHT. AMEN.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER
[1:53:29] HAVE a negative thought.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Paul was building, THEY WERE BUILDING A
[1:53:40] CHOP BLOCK OUT THERE AND SAID, "YOU KNOW
[1:53:43] WHAT THAT IS, BOY? WE'RE GOING TO CHOP
[1:53:45] YOUR HEAD OFF."
[1:53:47] IT IS.
[1:53:49] I HAVE FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT.
[1:53:54] I FINISHED MY COURSE.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; I have kept THE FAITH.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; HEY, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING THAT FOR?
[1:54:00] YOU'RE GOING TO DIE. OH, DEATH. THAT
[1:54:03] LITTLE OLD HOOK KNOWS YOU. I KNOW YOU. I
[1:54:07] BEAT YOU TO PIECES. I BEAT YOU WITH
[1:54:09] STRIPES.
[1:54:11] THEY DID THIS OR THAT TO YOU, BUT I'VE
[1:54:14] GOT YOU NOW. He looked at death and he
[1:54:18] said, "DEATH,
[1:54:21] WHERE IS YOUR STING AT?
[1:54:25] GREAT. WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY AT?
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; HENCE WHAT YOUR ATTITUDE IS TONIGHT.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYS WE'LL NEVER
[1:54:41] MAKE IT. BUT I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE OTHER
[1:54:45] SIDE.
[1:54:51] YOU MIGHT BE HEADED OVER THE PASTOR'S
[1:54:53] HOUSE, GOING DOWN THE ROAD SOMEWHERE
[1:54:55] ANOTHER, AND A TINY LITTLE LIGHT COMES
[1:54:56] DOWN. AND ONE OF THESE DAYS, IT'S BEEN
[1:54:59] SPOKE AND IT WILL COME TO PASS. YOU'RE
[1:55:01] GOING TO BE CHANGED IN THE MOMENT, AND
[1:55:04] THE TWINKLING of an eye.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand's preaching. IT'S NOT JUST
[1:55:11] WORDS. SHE'LL BE BONE OF HIS BONE.
[1:55:13] SHE'LL BE LIFE OF HIS LIFE. SHE'LL BE
[1:55:15] POWER OF HIS POWER. SHE'LL BE SPIRIT OF
[1:55:17] THE SPIRIT. HEY, IT'S GOING TO COME TO
[1:55:19] PASS.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; SHE WILL BE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Them ain't good motivational words.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; That's just truth.
[1:55:41] You'll lay hands on the sick and they
[1:55:44] shall recover.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; You'll fill out a check one DAY AND SAY,
[1:55:51] "GOD, I need a job." And you'll fill out
[1:55:54] a check and you'll send it through the
[1:55:56] bank of heaven and it never comes back
[1:55:58] in sufficient funds.
[1:56:01] I said TONIGHT IT NEVER COMES back in
[1:56:04] sufficient funks.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; You may have TO WAIT TWO DAYS, 5 DAYS,
[1:56:11] 10 YEARS, 25 YEARS. But I got news FOR
[1:56:14] YOU. ONE DAY IT CASTES THROUGH THE BANK
[1:56:16] OF HEAVEN.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY UNTO THAT MOUNTAIN, BE THOU
[1:56:21] REMOVED AND CAST INTO THE SEA. WHEN YOU
[1:56:24] SPEAK IT, ONE GRAIN OF SAND ROLLS OVER.
[1:56:31] HALLELUJAH.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; I GOT NEWS FOR YOU TONIGHT. NO WEAPON
[1:56:35] THAT IS FORMED AGAINST ME IS GOING TO
[1:56:38] PROSPER.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY, JUST START
[1:56:47] QUOTING THE WORD TO HIM BECAUSE THAT'S
[1:56:49] THE MOST SUPERNATURAL THING ABOUT YOUR
[1:56:51] WHOLE BODY.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:56:57] JESUS SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN. IT IS
[1:56:59] WRITTEN. IT IS WRITTEN."
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN.
[1:57:04] IT IS WRITTEN. IT IS WRITTEN." OH,
[1:57:07] LITTLE BRIDE, TONIGHT, IF WE COULD ONLY
[1:57:09] SAY, "IT is written. It is written. It
[1:57:13] is written.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM."
[1:57:25] Call Sister Connie.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother Ed.
[1:57:33] Right there in a coma condition,
[1:57:36] Brother Ed says,
[1:57:39] "You're going to preach AT 2008
[1:57:43] BIBLE Way Campground.
[1:58:10] How does all that work, brother Ron?
[1:58:12] Believer
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; plus faith in the word
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; UTTERS IT ACROSS THE LIPS.
[1:58:21] NOW, ONCE IT IS RELEASED,
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; once it's released,
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT A DEVIL IN HELL,
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST DEVIL IN CANADA,
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST DEVIL IN ZIMBABWE,
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST DEVIL IN ARGENTINA, AMEN.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to call out some champions
[1:58:53] tonight.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST DEVIL IN LOUISIANA,
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; New New Orleans,
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I wish I could stand here and
[1:59:11] preach.
[1:59:15] BUT ONCE HE UTTERED IT,
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; she believed it.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; SHE TRANSFERRED IT INTO MY EARS.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A SEED DOWN INSIDE OF THERE
[1:59:27] THAT DON'T NEED TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A
[1:59:29] COMA.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; CUZ GOD JUST SAID, "GO AHEAD AND REST A
[1:59:37] LITTLE BIT, SON. YOU NEED A COUPLE WEEKS
[1:59:39] OFF.
[1:59:52] YOU THINK GOD GETS EXCITED? PETER DONE
[1:59:54] PREACHED ALL DAY LONG. HE DIDN'T GET A
[1:59:56] GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, SO HE HAD HIM
[1:59:57] ARRESTED.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; PUT HIM IN JAIL.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; LAID HIM BETWEEN SOLDIERS.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T GET EXCITED ABOUT CANCER.
[2:00:10] GOD DON'T GET EXCITED ABOUT YOUR CRISIS.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE ONE THAT GETS EXCITED.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE ONE THAT GETS TORE ALL THE
[2:00:17] PIECES.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE ONE THAT CRIES, "OH, GOD'S
[2:00:21] FORSAKEN ME." GOD'S GOT YOU IN THE PALM
[2:00:23] OF HIS HAND.
[2:00:37] I feel like I could just take a take a
[2:00:39] walk.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; I feel like I could walk RIGHT NOW.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I FEEL LIKE MY BODY'S
[2:00:46] GETTING READY TO TAKE A CHANGE FOR SURE.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; In one ear, the devil saying, "You don't
[2:00:55] know what you're doing. We're going to
[2:00:56] come after you." So,
[2:01:01] so
[2:01:07] Goliath was a champion of champions.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Some of you had some Goliaths to come to
[2:01:13] your house, too.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Scream in your ears
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; and you watch people around you just
[2:01:20] tremble on shake.
[2:01:27] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT GOLIATH'S BIGGEST
[2:01:29] PROBLEM WAS? THERE WAS A GUY CAME on the
[2:01:32] scene
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS PREDESTINATED
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE HIS HEAD OFF.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT SATAN'S PROBLEM IS IN
[2:01:46] SATAN'S EDEN?
[2:01:53] He has created Hollywood.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; He has created devils for politicians.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; HE HAS CREATED SODOM AND GOMORRAH.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; HE HAS CREATED EVERY JOB. HE HAS CREATED
[2:02:05] EVERY MODERN DAY CHURCH THAT YOU CAN
[2:02:07] HAVE.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; BUT HIS BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THERE IS A
[2:02:11] BRIDE THAT'S ON THE EARTH.
[2:02:23] The song says, "I'M SO GLAD I GOT IN
[2:02:26] THIS ARMY AT A GOOD TIME."
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE LEGAL POSSESSION BY JESUS

[2:03:56] BODIES AND SET EVERY ONE OF THEM FREE
[2:03:58] FROM SICKNESSES,
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; from evil powers.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE DEFEATED.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother, I'M HAVING MARRIAGE
[2:04:21] PROBLEMS.
[2:04:23] JUST TELL HIM, "Get out."
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Get out.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT WELCOME IN MY HOME.

[2:04:38] AWAY. DON'T YOU GIVE UP. DON'T YOU NEVER
[2:04:41] NEVER NEVER
[2:04:44] GIVE UP.

[2:04:59] ANOTHER OR WITH SOME STRANGE WOMAN
[2:05:01] SOMEWHERE ANOTHER. LISTEN, GOD IS
[2:05:03] FAITHFUL.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DO
[2:05:10] YOU? YES, SIR. MY MAMA PRAYED THAT AND
[2:05:13] HERE I AM TONIGHT.
[2:05:21] OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SITTING THERE TONIGHT BACKSLIDING
[2:05:25] AS A GOOSE AND YOU KNOW YOU ARE.

[2:05:46] CUZ I ain't done.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; I got some chopping to do just here for
[2:05:58] a few minutes.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; You've allowed little old THINGS TO
[2:06:01] CREEP INTO YOUR HOME THAT YOU KNOW DON'T
[2:06:03] need to be there.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; It's time you GO HOME AND SPEAK TO THEM
[2:06:07] THINGS AND SAY, "HEY BOY, TIME TO GET
[2:06:09] OUT."
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO TAKE POSTERS OFF OF WALLS
[2:06:13] THAT DON'T NEED TO BE THERE. IT'S TIME
[2:06:15] TO TAKE CDS OUT OF CD PLAYERS THAT DON'T
[2:06:18] NEED TO BE THERE. IT'S TIME TO TAKE
[2:06:20] MOVIES AND THROW THEM IN THE TRASH.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO HAVE A BURNING PARTY
[2:06:32] TONIGHT. IT'S TIME TO TAKE SPLIT TAIL
[2:06:35] DRESSES AND HIGH HEEL SHOES
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; AND SCISSORS AND TRIM YOUR HAIR THAT
[2:06:40] NOBODY ELSE KNOWS ABOUT.
[2:06:43] IT'S TIME TO TAKE SHORTS. IT'S TIME TO
[2:06:46] TAKE THOSE PANTS THAT WADDLE DOWN PAST
[2:06:47] YOUR WAIST.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO TAKE EARRINGS OUT.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO TAKE STUDS OUT OF YOUR
[2:07:09] MOUTH.
[2:07:21] It's time to GET RID OF THOSE SKIN DOWN
[2:07:23] WIENER DRESSES.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; OH, brother Ron, I JUST GOT TO SHOW
[2:07:32] MYSELF I DON'T HAVE BUT A SHORT TIME.
[2:07:34] After a while, I weigh 210bs.
[2:08:01] Come on. You don't have to be a Barbie
[2:08:03] doll to get a boyfriend.
[2:08:07] Brother Brandham was here today. He had
[2:08:09] looked down. He looked at that stuff
[2:08:10] over top of eyes.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe not be a person in this building
[2:08:15] got it on, but I don't preach it anyway.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; They paint up
[2:08:21] paint up like a baboon.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; EVEN GRANDMAS STARTED PAINTING UP LIKE A
[2:08:29] BABOON.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; GOT A TATTOO ON THE LEG.
[2:08:36] HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; GOT A SHOE THAT THEY NEED A LADDER to
[2:08:43] get IN AND A PARACHUTE TO GET OUT OF.
[2:09:12] You're going down the road and you're
[2:09:13] going,
[2:09:21] "NOBODY KNOWS. GOD KNOWS." AMEN.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; You change your channel. YOU PULL A CD.
[2:09:26] YOU PUT IT UNDER YOUR UNDER YOUR UNDER
[2:09:28] YOUR THING. YOU HOPE YOU HOPE MOM DON'T
[2:09:30] LOOK.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; I hit a pin. I know I did.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; I hope dad don't RAID MY CAR. WHAT ABOUT
[2:09:39] GOD RAIDING YOUR CAR?
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE GOD RIGHT NOW IS RAIDING SOME
[2:09:43] CARS.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; THERE SITES YOU'VE BEEN GOING TO ON THE
[2:09:49] INTERNET YOU KNOW YOU BETTER not be
[2:09:50] going to.
[2:09:56] Brother Ron, I'm going to GO AWAY ON A
[2:09:57] TWO-WAY HOLIDAY. I'M GOING TO LET MY
[2:10:00] HAIR DOWN. GOD GOES WITH YOU.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE ALONE.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; CHARACTER IS WHAT YOU ARE WHEN YOU'RE
[2:10:11] UNDER PRESSURE. AND IT'S ALSO WHAT YOU
[2:10:13] ARE WHEN YOU'RE BY YOURSELF. ANY OLD
[2:10:16] HALF HYPOCRITE CAN LIVE RIGHT HERE IN
[2:10:18] CAMP. BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU GO BACK
[2:10:20] HOME?
[2:10:27] BROTHER RON, I GO BACK HOME TO AN
[2:10:28] UNBELIEVING FAMILY. YOU GO IN THERE AND
[2:10:30] LOOK AT THEM AND SAY, "I DON'T WATCH
[2:10:31] THEM THINGS NO MORE.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; I DON'T LISTEN TO THAT KIND OF MUSIC NO
[2:10:35] MORE."
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY ACTUALLY SURPRISE YOURSELF AND
[2:10:38] GET YOUR FAMILY SAVED.
[2:10:51] HALLELUJAH. Boo devil.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get you. I'M GOING TO GET
[2:11:00] YOU. I'M GOING TO GET YOU. YOU SHOULD
[2:11:01] HAVE GOT ME BEFORE.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; BOOVIL.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; I'm a WINNER EITHER WAY.
[2:11:14] WHO ARE YOU? I am a son of God.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; And you are a son of God.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:11:39] Yeah, you'll have to wash it tonight.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Devil,
[2:11:50] get out.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Shake off the grave clothes. You don't
[2:11:58] need them no more.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Shake off the baggy pants. You don't
[2:12:04] need them no more.
[2:12:06] SHAKE OFF THE SHORTS. YOU DON'T
[2:12:09] NEED THEM NO MORE.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; CANCER, I DON'T NEED YOU NO MORE.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going TO QUIT FEELING SORRY FOR
[2:12:30] MYSELF.
[2:12:32] I'M GOING TO GO TO CHURCH AND SAY AMEN
[2:12:34] IF NOBODY ELSE SAYS AMEN.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; That old pride devil comes to church
[2:12:48] with you and he sits there right on the
[2:12:49] pew with you. He says, "Don't you say
[2:12:51] amen?
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Don't you say amen? You'll get fanatical
[2:12:56] before long.
[2:13:00] Don't you patch your foot.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Don't you patch your foot. DON'T YOU
[2:13:05] CLAP YOUR HANDS.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; YOU BETTER WATCH YOURSELF. YOU'RE GOING
[2:13:09] TO BE RIGHT OUT THERE IN THE AISLE WITH
[2:13:11] THAT WOMAN SHOUTING.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham SAID, "I GOT TO
[2:13:17] THINKING IF I HAD THE VICTORY THAT SHE'S
[2:13:20] GOT."
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:27] HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:32] HALLELUJAH.

[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:55] HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; You've been DOWN ON YOUR KNEES. YOU'VE
[2:14:13] BEEN CRYING OUT TO GOD, "GOD, SEND US A
[2:14:16] REVIVAL.
[2:14:18] SEND US A REVIVAL. SEND US A REVIVAL."
[2:14:21] AND THE DEVIL HAS DONE EVERYTHING THAT
[2:14:23] HE COULD DO TO STOP IT AND TRY TO STOP
[2:14:25] IT AND TRY TO STOP IT. BUT LOOK WHO'S
[2:14:28] GOT THE VICTORY TONIGHT.
[2:14:46] SILVER AND GOLD HAVE I NONE,
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; BUT SUCH AS I HAVE GIVE I THEY IN THE
[2:14:52] NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. RISE UP AND WALK.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS
[2:15:03] TONIGHT.
[2:15:08] I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW SMALL OR HOW BIG,
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; RAYMOND, YOUR LITTLE BOY, GOD'S A
[2:15:20] HEALER.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:15:39] You want the HOLY GHOST TONIGHT. YOU
[2:15:42] FIGHT OVER EVERY DEVIL,
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; every lying spirit.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; YOU TELL THAT DEVIL, I'M NOT LEAVING
[2:15:49] THIS TENT.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; TILL I GET WHAT I CAME FOR.
[2:16:01] EVERY SPIRIT THAT HAS BEEN ATTACKING ME,
[2:16:03] I WANT YOU TO TAKE YOUR LIPS TONIGHT.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; I want you to TAKE YOUR VOCAL CORDS
[2:16:08] TONIGHT.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; It's not enough for ME TO TELL YOU. It's
[2:16:14] not enough for brother Ed to TELL YOU,
[2:16:16] BROTHER TOM. NOW YOU GOT TO START
[2:16:19] SPEAKING.
[2:16:24] WHATEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH,
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU LOOSE ON EARTH, I'M GOING
[2:16:29] TO LOOSE IN HEAVEN.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; I CHALLENGE EVERY DOUBT SPIRIT IN THIS
[2:16:40] BUILDING TONIGHT TO LEAVE IN THE NAME OF
[2:16:43] JESUS CHRIST.
[2:16:56] LEAVE. You have no authority here. THIS
[2:16:59] IS GOD'S PROPERTY. GET OFF. GET OFF. GET
[2:17:03] OFF IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[2:17:19] If I were in your shoes and I had a
[2:17:22] need, I'D RUN TO THIS ALTAR TONIGHT. I'D
[2:17:26] RAISE MY HANDS TO GOD AND SAY, "GOD, I
[2:17:29] THANK YOU THAT YOU HEAL MY BODY. THANK
[2:17:31] YOU THAT YOU FILL ME WITH THE HOLY
[2:17:33] GHOST. THANK YOU THAT YOU CAST AWAY
[2:17:35] DEVILS FROM HELL.

[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; OUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS. TONIGHT,
[2:19:05] Satan hasn't got no legal authority.
[2:19:09] He has no paperwork.
[2:19:12] HE IS THE ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN AND HE
[2:19:15] IS CAST DOWN
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; BY THE BLOOD of the lamb and THE WORD OF
[2:19:20] OUR TESTIMONY TONIGHT.

[2:38:23] I give you love.
[2:38:34] You are the
[2:38:41] truth, the way
[2:38:47] the
[2:38:49] bless Bless your name. I bless the name.
[2:38:57] I bless your name.
[2:39:03] I bless your name.
[2:39:09] I give you all.
[2:39:15] Give you praise.
[2:39:20] You are my
[2:39:26] truth the way
[2:39:33] your nameless.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; What a privilege we have to bless his
[2:39:42] name. I bless your name.
[2:39:49] I
[2:39:58] give you honor. I give you
[2:40:13] the
[2:40:27] Two things I like to say to this waiting
[2:40:29] congregation,
[2:40:31] this praising congregation this evening.
[2:40:35] Our Lord Jesus Christ is pleased.
[2:40:40] Almighty God is pleased when we worship
[2:40:43] him. He's an object of worship.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; He created angels to worship him.
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the greatest thing we
[2:40:53] can do in life is give him praise.
[2:40:57] &gt;&gt; Not just from our lips, but from our
[2:40:59] lives. We give him praise.
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; We sat here this evening
[2:41:10] and we heard the sound.
[2:41:13] They heard a sound of a miracle.
[2:41:18] Our God is a miracle working God. Our
[2:41:21] God is not human. He's supernatural.
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; He's almighty. He's not limited.
[2:41:29] Whatever he chooses to do tonight and
[2:41:32] whatever he has chosen to do,
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; we want to be very careful that we come
[2:41:38] back and give him thanksgiving.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; Give him what's due to him.
[2:41:45] It's not a labor.
[2:41:48] It's not difficult.
[2:41:51] It's not something a preacher has to
[2:41:53] force or excite you to do it. It's
[2:41:55] something that's in your soul. I've come
[2:41:57] back to give you thanksgiving.
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; Our brother Ron is gone now back. I want
[2:42:05] to say to you, it's not just a miracle
[2:42:08] from last September till now.
[2:42:11] Brother Brandon when he told of
[2:42:13] supernatural things of the boy in
[2:42:15] Finland being raised from the dead and
[2:42:17] other great things that took place in a
[2:42:20] sister in their own area that had cancer
[2:42:22] in the heart and was healed was supposed
[2:42:24] to been gone and lived for many many
[2:42:27] many years. He told those over and over
[2:42:30] and over again. WHY? BECAUSE GOD'S NOT
[2:42:34] IN A box of time.
[2:42:37] Something that happened 50 years ago or
[2:42:39] 5,000 years ago is just as great as it
[2:42:41] was 5 minutes ago.
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SECOND GREAT MIRACLE THAT GOD
[2:42:48] DID in our brother Ron Spencer's life,
[2:42:51] and nobody would know it better than his
[2:42:52] mom and dad who are who are here this
[2:42:54] evening, was when he was bound by every
[2:42:58] devil of hell.
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; And just one night,
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; God said, "That's it.
[2:43:05] you're done.
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't up and down and up and
[2:43:08] down and in and out. And I want to say
[2:43:10] to this camp and you young men, the
[2:43:12] thing that I have cried for and prayed
[2:43:15] for even tonight is that the full birth
[2:43:18] takes place.
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; And that you're done with the world.
[2:43:23] You're done with sitting on the fence.
[2:43:27] YOU GET ON FIRE FOR GOD tonight and it's
[2:43:30] over forever.
[2:43:35] I KNOW IT WORKED.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; IT HAPPENED TO ME.
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; IT HAPPENED TO MANY OTHERS that are
[2:43:42] here.
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; Both young and old, it happened.
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; How many had a birth AND IT WAS ALL over
[2:43:53] right from then?
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; Let's see your hands as a testimony.
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:59] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:44:01] How many want to BE HONEST AND SAY THAT
[2:44:03] HASN'T HAPPENED to me but that's why I'm
[2:44:05] standing here tonight and that's what
[2:44:07] I'm praying for and that's what I
[2:44:09] believe God is going to do for me. I
[2:44:10] HAVE THAT FULL BIRTH. I'LL BE DONE. I'M
[2:44:13] DONE WITH THE WORLD. I WANT TO GIVE A
[2:44:16] TESTIMONY TO THAT TONIGHT. HALLELUJAH.
[2:44:19] GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS YOU for being
[2:44:22] honest. And God will do just that.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:27] &gt;&gt; If some midnight hour
[2:44:37] If you should find,
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; you should find
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; you're in a praise
[2:44:49] in your mind.
[2:44:52] Oh, just reach out and praise.
[2:44:59] Defy those saints
[2:45:04] and they will fall
[2:45:10] in Jesus
[2:45:12] name.
[2:45:15] I bless your name.
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; I bless your name,
[2:45:25] Lord. I give you I give you all the
[2:45:30] honor, Lord, and I give you all the
[2:45:34] praise.
[2:45:37] You are alive,
[2:45:42] knowing the truth.
[2:45:48] I bless your name, Lord. I bless your
[2:45:53] name. I bless your
[2:45:56] name.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; Bless your name.
[2:46:05] I bless your name.
[2:46:11] I give you.
[2:46:14] Lord, I give you all the honor and I
[2:46:17] give you praise.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[2:46:22] You are the life,
[2:46:27] the truth, the way.
[2:46:33] I bless your name.
[2:46:39] I bless
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; the midnight hour.
[2:46:44] some midnight hour.
[2:46:50] If you should find
[2:46:55] that you're in a prison
[2:47:01] in your
[2:47:03] mind,
[2:47:06] reach out and praise.
[2:47:11] defy
[2:47:13] those chains.
[2:47:16] &gt;&gt; Those chains and they will they will
[2:47:19] fall.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; They will fall in Jesus
[2:47:25] name.
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, I bless your name.
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; I bless your name, Lord.
[2:47:39] And I give you
[2:47:42] honor.
[2:47:44] I give you praise.
[2:47:50] You are the life,
[2:47:55] the truth, the way.
[2:48:01] I bless your name.
[2:48:08] Bless your name.
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; This is rapture atmosphere, folks.
[2:48:38] rapture atmosphere.
[2:48:41] &gt;&gt; One of these days it'll be just like
[2:48:44] this
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; and you won't hardly know there's a a
[2:48:47] change. will be just another dimension
[2:48:50] and he'll just be continuing on to
[2:48:51] worship.
[2:49:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:11] Look for me. Look for me for I will be
[2:49:15] there too.
[2:49:17] for me
[2:49:20] for I will be there too.
[2:49:29] I realize
[2:49:33] when you arrive,
[2:49:36] there'll be so much left to do
[2:49:41] after you've been there
[2:49:45] 10,000 years, a million maybe
[2:49:51] to look for me
[2:49:56] for I will be there too.
[2:50:04] Look for me
[2:50:08] for I will be there too.
[2:50:17] I realize
[2:50:20] when you arise
[2:50:24] there'll be so much there to do.
[2:50:28] &gt;&gt; But after you've been there
[2:50:32] 10,000
[2:50:33] years, a million baby
[2:50:38] to look for me.
[2:50:44] I will be
[2:50:49] Not to take away from this wonderful
[2:50:50] atmosphere, but I think
[2:50:53] I think it would just be
[2:50:56] right and appropriate
[2:50:58] as we sing that again from our heart. We
[2:51:03] turn around and we shake hands with
[2:51:06] someone that you plan to spend eternity
[2:51:09] with.
[2:51:11] I don't know about you folks.
[2:51:14] Everybody has to make their own
[2:51:15] decision.
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it seems so glorious to me and
[2:51:20] I wonder how it's going to happen. But
[2:51:23] all I have I just have a promise
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; and I've anchored my soul in that
[2:51:28] promise.
[2:51:30] &gt;&gt; I plan to go there.
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; The world's not comfortable for me.
[2:51:37] Hasn't been comfortable since I've been
[2:51:39] a teenager.
[2:51:40] I'm not comfortable with the world.
[2:51:43] Never have been, never will be. There's
[2:51:47] only one place.
[2:51:49] It's that celestial city.
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; Christian,
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; how many Christian do we have here? You
[2:51:55] were on the path today. There's only one
[2:51:57] place. You're at home.
[2:52:00] &gt;&gt; And we're on our way. This is just
[2:52:02] another little station here called
[2:52:04] Family Camp 208. Just one more station,
[2:52:07] one more gate we went through.
[2:52:22] When you get over there,
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; look for me.
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; I'll look for you.
[2:52:30] &gt;&gt; Let's greet one another as we sing it
[2:52:32] once again.
[2:52:36] Look for me
[2:52:40] for I will be there too.
[2:52:48] And I realize
[2:52:51] when you arrive,
[2:52:55] there'll be so much there to do after
[2:53:00] you
[2:53:02] been there 10,000 years,
[2:53:06] a million
[2:53:08] maybe two

[2:53:51] years, a million

[3:01:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:02:17] Just just in case you think that looks
[3:02:20] strange,
[3:02:22] think about a service or a gathering and
[3:02:24] a woman comes walking up to a stranger
[3:02:28] sitting there named Jesus of Nazareth.
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; And she begins to wash his feet with her
[3:02:35] tears. And brother Brandham describing
[3:02:38] it. He says, "And she's she's kissing
[3:02:40] his feet." She's going
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; and her hair falls down
[3:02:48] while she's washing and kissing his feet
[3:02:50] and she begins, she's overcome. She's
[3:02:52] beside herself and she begins to wipe
[3:02:55] his feet.
[3:02:57] Everyone else just watched her.
[3:03:01] &gt;&gt; But Jesus never put one word in the
[3:03:03] Bible what everybody else did. just what
[3:03:06] she did.
[3:03:11] And
[3:03:12] &gt;&gt; I can tell you Jesus loves what he sees
[3:03:14] tonight.
[3:03:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not waving for you. I'm waving for
[3:03:19] him.
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; THERE'LL BE A GREAT procession
[3:03:24] &gt;&gt; in that city in the sky.
[3:03:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:28] &gt;&gt; All right. And then we're going to close
[3:03:30] in prayer because unless you want to run
[3:03:33] straight to it tomorrow morning, we

[3:05:04] blessing. Another blessing.
[3:05:08] &gt;&gt; Wasn't the word rich tonight?
[3:05:15] &gt;&gt; You just don't know what it means to me.
[3:05:17] Friends,
[3:05:19] just
[3:05:21] just a supernatural happening. Amen.
[3:05:24] &gt;&gt; I just pray that God will take our
[3:05:26] brother
[3:05:29] Ron Spencer and make him a vessel that
[3:05:32] will bring the spirit of God to a lot of
[3:05:35] other places.

[3:05:54] make his people pull as hard as these
[3:05:56] people pull.
