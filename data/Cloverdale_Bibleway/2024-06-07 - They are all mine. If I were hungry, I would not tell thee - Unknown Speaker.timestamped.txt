[0:00] Psalm 50 a Psalm of Isa the Mighty God
[0:04] even the Lord hath spoken and called the
[0:07] Earth from the rising of the sun unto
[0:09] the going down thereof out of Zion the
[0:12] Perfection of beauty God hath shined Our
[0:15] God shall come and shall not keep
[0:17] silence a fire shall devour before him
[0:20] and it shall be very tempestuous round
[0:22] about him he shall call to the heavens
[0:25] from above and to the Earth that he may
[0:27] judge his people gather my Saints
[0:30] together unto me those that have made a
[0:32] covenant with me by sacrifice and the
[0:34] heavens shall declare his righteousness
[0:36] for God is Judge himself Sila hear oh my
[0:41] people and I will speak oh Israel and I
[0:43] will testify against thee I am God even
[0:47] thy God I will not reprove thee for thy
[0:49] sacrifices or thy burned offerings to
[0:52] have been continually before me I will
[0:54] take no bulock out of thy house nor he
[0:57] goats out of thy folds forever beast of
[1:00] the forest is mine and the cattle Upon A
[1:03] Thousand Hills I know all the fowls of
[1:05] the mountains and the wild beasts of the
[1:08] field are mine if I were hungry I would
[1:11] not tell thee for the world is mine and
[1:13] the fullness thereof will I eat the
[1:16] Flesh of bulls or drink the blood of
[1:18] goats offer unto God Thanksgiving and
[1:21] pay thy vows unto the most high and call
[1:23] upon me in the day of trouble I will
[1:25] deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me
[1:28] but unto the wicked God God saith what
[1:30] hast thou to do to declare my statutes
[1:33] or that thou shouldest take my Covenant
[1:35] in thy mouth seeing thou hatest
[1:37] instruction and castest my words behind
[1:40] thee when thou sawest a thief then thou
[1:43] consented with him and Hast been
[1:45] partaker with adulterers thou givest thy
[1:48] mouth to evil and thy tongue Fram deceit
[1:51] thou sest and speakest against thy
[1:53] brother thou slander is thine own
[1:55] Mother's Son these things hast thou done
[1:58] and I kept silence
[2:00] thou thest that I was altogether such in
[2:02] one as thyself but I will reprove thee
[2:05] and set them in order before Thine Eyes
[2:07] now consider this ye that forget God
[2:10] lest I tear you in pieces and there be
[2:13] none to deliver who so offereth praise
[2:15] glorify me and to him that orderthe
[2:18] conversation AR right will I show the
[2:20] salvation of God
