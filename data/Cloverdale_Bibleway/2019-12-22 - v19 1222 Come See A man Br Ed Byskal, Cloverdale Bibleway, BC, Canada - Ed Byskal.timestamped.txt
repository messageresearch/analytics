[0:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. that you come down from heaven,
[0:29] Lord. You left the ramparts of glory,

[0:35] redeem us and to save us and to deliver
[0:38] us, Father. Lord God, you became man
[0:41] that we might become you, oh God. You
[0:44] took our place, Lord. You went to
[0:47] Calvary for us, Father. You took our
[0:50] sins with you there, Lord. You who knew
[0:52] no sin became sin, oh God. Oh father,
[0:57] not only did you become sin and you
[0:59] died, but you you took those sins to
[1:01] hell with you, Lord. You were tormented
[1:04] by the enemy. You were tortured, Father.
[1:07] But oh God, you raised from the dead
[1:10] with the keys of death, hell, and the
[1:12] grave. Oh God, for that we want to give
[1:15] you glory, Lord. We want to praise you
[1:17] and lift up your holy name, oh God. Oh,
[1:21] you came as a baby blood, but Lord, you
[1:23] ascended as a king of glory. Lord God,
[1:27] &gt;&gt; you're victorious. Father,
[1:29] &gt;&gt; we love you this morning, Lord.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Receive our worship, oh God.
[1:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, we bring our needs before
[1:37] you, Lord.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; You have supplied every need, Lord. You
[1:42] took the stripes on our on your back for
[1:44] your our healing, Father.
[1:47] You're our deliverer, Lord. You're our
[1:49] redeemer, oh God. We come to you,
[1:52] Father, with confidence knowing that you
[1:54] have already supplied and we thank you
[1:57] for it, Lord.
[1:59] Oh God, we give you this service this
[2:01] morning. Father, anoint our pastor,
[2:04] Lord. Anoint him, Lord God, with the oil

[5:00] If you ever get a chance to have them
[5:02] over and and uh uh and try and encourage
[5:06] them, they don't really need your
[5:08] encouragement, but they will encourage
[5:09] you. I said, you are uh your testimony

[5:22] baptized and identified with this
[5:24] message. I said that's the way to get
[5:25] your husband,
[5:27] get him saved and then marry him. So,

[7:28] right?" I said, "All right." I said,
[7:31] "Brother Ed, take them all. We love
[7:34] you." And I I love that last message
[7:37] Brother Brem preached. I think brother
[7:38] John alluded to it on Wednesday night
[7:41] which was a tremendous service. But
[7:43] God's gifts always and I love that word
[7:47] always find their place. So God gave us
[7:51] at Cloverdale Bible Way a tremendous
[7:54] gift in the man of God. And I want to
[7:57] give God the re I want to recognize that
[8:00] to him this morning. How thankful we are

[32:00] remarks before we read the scripture.
[32:03] And I'm going to have brother John Andes
[32:05] read the scripture for me.
[32:08] Uh, Brother Brandham often referred to
[32:12] the woman at the well.
[32:16] This is also one of the scriptures.
[32:20] I want you to really pay attention to
[32:22] this. This is also one of the scriptures
[32:25] which we have in John 4 and we're going
[32:27] to read.
[32:29] But this is one of the scriptures that
[32:31] the angel of the Lord referred him to
[32:36] when he was entering into the second
[32:40] pole of his ministry and revealing the
[32:43] secrets of the hearts of the people. And
[32:46] the ministers
[32:49] ministers told him it's of the devil.
[32:54] And uh
[32:57] the people people had a difficult time
[33:00] and I had a difficult time speaking
[33:02] about this because that was the very
[33:05] thing that anchored my heart
[33:09] because I thought no man can do this.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; This has to be from another place. Amen.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; And I was just uh a teenager
[33:23] as some of you are. I was 14
[33:27] when I first saw that
[33:30] and and I heard a man from Vancouver
[33:34] actually who was Ern Baxter
[33:38] and he was pastoring a church downtown.
[33:40] He became
[33:42] brother Brham's first manager.
[33:45] And I heard him at the platform saying
[33:48] before brother Brandham came out
[33:51] and he said, "Now, Brother Brandham will
[33:54] not begin to preach. We'll not begin to
[33:58] pray for the sick until the angel of the
[34:02] Lord is here at the platform."
[34:05] And I that just
[34:08] smoked my heart. I thought I have heard
[34:12] about angels.
[34:14] I have had Sunday school teachers
[34:19] refer to us out of the scripture about
[34:21] angels, but I have never seen a man that
[34:26] spoke to an angel
[34:29] and I want to hear him. And brother
[34:32] Brandham came out and began to pray for
[34:34] the sake.
[34:36] And that is the night or the day I saw a
[34:40] blind girl healed.
[34:42] And I never forgot that.
[34:46] It is remarkable
[34:48] how his ministry
[34:51] unfolds the makeup
[34:54] of our human being, our body,
[34:59] our spirit,
[35:02] and our soul. Now, I won't let you get
[35:05] out of this building today without
[35:08] pricking your heart with a a phrase that
[35:14] you've heard him say many, many times.
[35:18] Now, I'm I want to take every spirit in
[35:22] this building
[35:24] under my control. And when he said that,
[35:28] I thought that has to that statement has
[35:31] to come from another place. Who has the
[35:35] control of every spirit of every person
[35:41] in a building?
[35:43] &gt;&gt; How does a man stand there and be able
[35:47] to say that unless God will come in,
[35:50] move behind him and allow that to take
[35:53] place? And that is why also he would
[35:57] tell the people don't move around,
[36:02] don't be, you know what he's saying is
[36:04] don't be irreverent.
[36:06] And so today I want to take uh my time
[36:11] and I want to engage some others to help
[36:16] in the service. And I would ask you to
[36:19] be as reverent and uh as
[36:25] respectful
[36:27] as you possibly can.
[36:31] Now, uh, I'm going to read and you can
[36:35] take your Bibles, please,
[36:40] and we'll turn to the book of John.
[36:49] I have some slides
[36:51] and I will have some audio as well. Now,
[36:55] I'll forewarn you ahead of time.
[37:03] The slides
[37:05] have to do with
[37:08] included in the slides
[37:11] are
[37:12] uh audio portions
[37:15] that I was seated here
[37:20] probably no further than where John or
[37:23] Tom is. brother Tom from me
[37:27] and uh my mind was filled with questions
[37:31] because
[37:33] the scriptures had not been revealed
[37:35] open to me concerning baptism and
[37:39] concerning Godhead and concerning the
[37:42] serpent seed. Now, do you have any
[37:45] questions?
[37:48] And brother Brandham said when the
[37:50] people came up, he said, "Now I just
[37:53] want to talk to the woman or I want to
[37:56] talk to the man, sir,
[37:59] and contact your spirit."
[38:05] That was him.
[38:07] Now, the scripture, the Bible you're
[38:09] holding says he's the same
[38:14] yesterday.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:16] So, I'm going to take some from the
[38:18] woman in the well.
[38:21] That was yesterday.
[38:23] And today,
[38:25] I was sitting on the platform
[38:29] 2,000 years.
[38:32] That sounds like a long time. That's not
[38:34] very long for God, a person that's
[38:39] eternal.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; That's no there are there's no
[38:42] yesterday.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; There's no tomorrow. And there's no
[38:45] today. It's all the same time. It's and
[38:49] I can tell you and I am speaking from
[38:53] being a witness of that. And then I
[38:57] stood where brother Tom is when
[39:02] he was contacting the spirits of some
[39:05] people that I knew
[39:08] and he would tell them what was going to
[39:12] take place. And some of you young men,
[39:14] well, you've heard me tell the story of
[39:16] the soldier boy.
[39:18] Now, you're going to hear brother
[39:20] Brandham cry out to him
[39:23] in the service.
[39:26] And the next day, I met him.
[39:29] The next day, it was all fulfilled.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; And I just felt that I would fail you if
[39:39] I didn't do this.
[39:42] And so I'm going to give you that as a
[39:45] gift
[39:48] and there'll be no Christmas like this.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; And furthermore,
[39:56] the prophet of God came and one of his
[40:01] first services was God
[40:04] in his people.
[40:07] That's God in
[40:09] &gt;&gt; you. You may not feel very worthy. You
[40:13] may not feel as though that is the case.
[40:17] But that happens to be the absolute
[40:20] truth.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; And you have to recognize that because
[40:26] if you don't recognize it, that doesn't
[40:30] stop it,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; but it will prevent God from using it
[40:35] the way he would like to. And so I'm
[40:39] going to be speaking to you at a service
[40:42] that I have held in my heart now for
[40:45] some weeks.
[40:47] And uh so I pray that you will
[40:52] be attentive. I know you will.
[40:55] And may this be a service that you will
[40:58] remember all your days.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; It's my prayer. Brother John,
[41:04] would you come and and read, please?
[41:08] We're starting at John the 4th chapter
[41:11] and verse
[41:14] is it five?
[41:16] Verse five.
[41:19] and John will be reading
[41:22] and I will I I like the way that he
[41:26] reads the scripture
[41:28] and we're reading it very slowly and
[41:32] very with emphasis.
[41:36] Okay, brother John
[41:37] &gt;&gt; John 4 verse 5.
[41:41] Then cometh he to a city of Samaria,
[41:45] which is called Saikar,
[41:48] near to the parcel of ground that Jacob
[41:50] gave to his son Joseph.
[41:53] Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus
[41:57] therefore
[41:58] being wearied with his journey,
[42:01] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to notice Jesus who is
[42:04] going to say to this woman later on, I
[42:07] am he.
[42:10] Yes.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Is he weary? He's weary.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; He's tired.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; He's thirsty.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; So continue.
[42:23] Jesus therefore being wearied with his
[42:26] journey sat thus on the well, and it was
[42:29] about the sixth hour. There cometh a
[42:33] woman of Samaria to draw water.
[42:37] Jesus saith unto her, "Give me to
[42:40] drink." For his disciples were gone away
[42:44] unto the city to buy meat.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you could put slide six up.
[42:51] Uh slide one rather. Slide one.
[43:00] And if you read verses nine and 10,
[43:02] we'll read it together and you can look
[43:04] it if you don't have your Bible.
[43:10] Verse N. Then saith the woman of Samaria
[43:14] unto him, How is it that thou being a
[43:18] Jew, askketh drink of me, which am a
[43:23] woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no
[43:26] dealings with the Samaritans. That is uh
[43:31] difficulty number one.
[43:34] How is it
[43:36] that you are speaking to me that Jews
[43:40] have no dealing with the Samaritans?
[43:43] And here's a young Jewish man in his 30s
[43:47] perhaps
[43:50] uh who is tired
[43:54] is obviously wearied by his journey
[43:58] and he's thirsty
[44:00] and he's asked for a drink of water from
[44:04] this woman.
[44:06] Now she has some hurdles to overcome.
[44:10] How is it that you a asking me Jews have
[44:14] no dealings with the Samaritans?
[44:17] That's a real problem.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered and said unto her, if
[44:24] thou kneest the gift of God,
[44:26] &gt;&gt; if thou kneest the gift of God. Now,
[44:30] he's going to unveil a gift to her. And
[44:34] I have chosen this time to unveil that
[44:38] gift to you.
[44:42] And who it is that saith to thee, give
[44:47] me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of
[44:50] him, and he would have given thee living
[44:55] water.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; The woman saith unto him, "Sir, thou
[45:02] hast nothing to draw with."
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Problem number three,
[45:06] &gt;&gt; and the well is deep. Problem number
[45:08] four,
[45:09] &gt;&gt; from whence then hast thou that living
[45:13] water?
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Number five,
[45:16] &gt;&gt; art thou greater than our father Jacob?
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Number six,
[45:21] &gt;&gt; who gave us the well, and drank thereof
[45:24] himself, and his children, and his
[45:28] cattle.
[45:30] Jesus answered and said unto her,
[45:33] "Whosoever drinkketh of this water shall
[45:36] thirst again,
[45:38] &gt;&gt; but whosoever drinkketh of the water
[45:42] that I shall give him shall never
[45:45] thirst."
[45:47] &gt;&gt; But the water that I shall give him
[45:50] shall be in him, a well of water
[45:54] springing up into everlasting life.
[45:57] Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Friends, there is a satisfying portion.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; There's even a portion where you will
[46:06] not return
[46:08] to have somebody some I know we're
[46:12] having a special speaker, our brother
[46:14] Ron Spencer. Uh, and that's wonderful.
[46:18] But remember that you can be inspired
[46:22] and you can be oh so caught up. Oh, you
[46:26] think I'll never be the same, but you
[46:29] have to come back and get another drink.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; But I can tell you that there is water
[46:35] &gt;&gt; that where you will never thirst again.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Never thirst again.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; God can do something in your life
[46:45] &gt;&gt; that will be so permanent,
[46:49] &gt;&gt; so powerful,
[46:51] &gt;&gt; it will answer your questions. And I
[46:55] have some things to ask you
[46:58] and remember during this service while
[47:00] brother John is reading.
[47:03] I wonder if he is here.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; I wonder if he is trying to catch your
[47:10] spirit
[47:13] &gt;&gt; and reveal himself to you.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; That will be the greatest gift
[47:19] &gt;&gt; I could give you.
[47:21] We'll continue to read
[47:23] &gt;&gt; verse 15.
[47:26] The woman saith unto him, "Sir, give me
[47:30] this water that I thirst not, neither
[47:34] come hither to draw."
[47:36] Jesus saith unto her, "Go, call thy
[47:40] husband, and come hither." The woman
[47:43] answered and said, "I have no husband."
[47:47] Jesus answered
[47:50] said unto her, "Thou hast well said, I
[47:53] have no husband, for thou hast had five
[47:57] husbands, and he whom thou now hast is
[48:02] not thy husband. In that, sayest thou,
[48:07] truly." The woman saith unto him, Sir, I
[48:11] perceive that thou art a prophet. Our
[48:14] fathers worshiped in this mountain. And
[48:18] ye say that in Jerusalem is the place
[48:21] where men ought to worship. Jesus saith
[48:24] unto her,"Woman,
[48:26] believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
[48:30] shall neither in this mountain, nor yet
[48:34] at Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye
[48:38] worship, ye know not what.
[48:42] We know what we worship. For salvation
[48:46] is of the Jews.
[48:48] But the hour cometh,
[48:51] and now is when the true worshippers
[48:55] shall worship the Father in spirit and
[48:59] in truth.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; For the Father seeketh such to worship
[49:04] him. Hallelujah.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit, and they that worship
[49:08] him must worship him in spirit
[49:12] &gt;&gt; and in truth.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; The woman saith unto him, I know that
[49:18] Messiah cometh,
[49:21] which is called Christ, when he has
[49:23] come, he will tell us all things.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to notice now this. He will
[49:30] tell me, tell us all things. Yes,
[49:34] &gt;&gt; please notice that.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; And brother and and the prophet of God
[49:39] brings out this. She he said she knew
[49:43] one thing. I know the Samaritans know. I
[49:49] know when the Messiah cometh, he will
[49:52] tell us all things. And and the Lord
[49:56] Jesus opened his mouth and told her one
[50:00] thing. It only needs to tell you one
[50:03] thing.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; And you feel as though your whole life
[50:06] has been exposed.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Come see a man."
[50:11] &gt;&gt; That's my message. Come see a man.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; That told me all things.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "I don't know
[50:20] you." That's William Brandham. I don't
[50:22] know you, but there's one here that
[50:25] knows us.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; And he knows everything about us. He
[50:29] knows all of our troubles, our
[50:30] difficulties, our trials,
[50:33] &gt;&gt; our burdens, and the things that are
[50:36] throw our lives into such a chaos
[50:39] sometimes.
[50:41] And we come and you've come now to this
[50:43] service and I want that you'll receive
[50:46] something.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Carry on, please.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Verse 26.
[50:52] Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto
[50:56] thee am he.
[50:59] And upon upon this came his disciples,
[51:02] and marveled that he talked with the
[51:05] woman. Yet no man said, What seekest
[51:08] thou? Or, why talkst thou with her? The
[51:13] woman then left her water pot, and went
[51:17] her way into the city, and saith to the
[51:20] men, Come see a man which told me all
[51:25] things that ever I did. Is not this the
[51:31] Christ?
[51:32] &gt;&gt; That's the question.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; And now this morning.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; And now today.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. Not back then.
[51:43] This same Christ,
[51:46] &gt;&gt; this is what this prophet of God and
[51:49] this what the ministry here and brother
[51:52] John spoke on Wednesday night. If you
[51:55] haven't heard it, you need to go home
[51:57] and stream that service. Wonderful
[52:00] service.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; God is in his people.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; And that's the greatest gift that we can
[52:10] give you. Amen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; The greatest gift. You may not care for
[52:14] the wrapping.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a different wrapping. He's
[52:19] given each child that's been born into
[52:22] the world a different wrapping.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And so you have your own wrapping.
[52:30] And maybe it's not appealing to
[52:33] everyone,
[52:36] but nevertheless,
[52:38] that's the wrapping. God has wrapped you
[52:42] up with a certain nature, a certain
[52:45] character.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; And uh and now I want to say to you,
[52:52] this man was dressed as a Jew. Come see
[52:55] a man.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; He's dressed as a Jew.
[52:59] a man wearied
[53:02] and thirsty.
[53:03] He doesn't look impressive.
[53:06] He doesn't look like some dynamic
[53:08] preacher.
[53:11] He was more than a prophet.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; He was the Messiah.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; A man wearied, thirsty with his journey.
[53:22] A man speaking to a woman of a diverse
[53:27] culture. Right?
[53:30] &gt;&gt; And actually the Jews considered them of
[53:33] a lower base
[53:35] culture.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; And so that is why when his disciples
[53:42] returned, they wouldn't ask him anything
[53:46] about why do you speak to this woman?
[53:50] And not only that, she was ill-famed.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[53:54] &gt;&gt; she was one that you may not wish to
[53:56] have as a neighbor.
[53:59] She had had five husbands
[54:02] &gt;&gt; and been unsuccessful
[54:04] with five husbands.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Unsuccessful. Not a very successful
[54:11] person. And the one she's with now is
[54:14] not her husband.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Not a very impressive
[54:21] &gt;&gt; no sir.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Record.
[54:24] But the Messiah met her and answered all
[54:27] of her questions in a moment of time.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; And that's the gift God and his people.
[54:34] Thank you, brother John. Thank you.
[54:41] That is why she said,
[54:44] "How is it?" I'll let you sit down in
[54:46] just a moment.
[54:49] How is it that you being a Jew
[54:52] ask a drink of me? That's a simple
[54:55] thing.
[55:00] She had the bucket. She could give him
[55:03] the water. She could give him a drink.
[55:07] Why didn't she just give him a drink and
[55:09] call it quits?
[55:12] &gt;&gt; She could have done that.
[55:14] You could do you can do things
[55:18] that are spiritual and acceptable to
[55:22] your neighbor, to your wife, to your
[55:25] husband, to your children,
[55:27] or the young people, to their parents,
[55:31] but is it what
[55:34] he really is troubling your spirit
[55:36] about?
[55:38] And that's what I want to ask.
[55:41] Is he trying to contact your spirit
[55:43] today?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; It's given to me to stand here.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; And I feel very humbled over that
[55:54] to think that a man,
[55:57] a father, a mother, a young person
[56:02] can have this God
[56:04] in them.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Are we worthy?
[56:09] probably not,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; but we'll pray.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[56:19] &gt;&gt; how I thank you for your children.
[56:22] How I thank you for your servants
[56:26] who have given themselves to you
[56:29] unreservedly.
[56:31] Lord, I do not know
[56:34] where you want to go today,
[56:37] but I am asking
[56:40] that the Messiah
[56:42] that sat on the well
[56:46] and spoke to a woman of Samaria will be
[56:50] here and speak to people from
[56:53] Washington, Idaho.
[56:57] We'll speak to people from London and
[56:59] Blaine and Cloverdale and Langley.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; We need you.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, we need you.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just gather in a church
[57:11] building.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; We'd sooner just meet you out in the
[57:17] wilderness someplace.
[57:20] Come and do what you would be pleased
[57:23] with.
[57:25] I ask it in your name Jesus Christ
[57:29] our Lord and Savior. Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[57:42] Jesus answered her and said,
[57:47] "If thou kneest, if you knew
[57:52] the gift of God,
[57:56] a lot of people are going to be giving
[57:58] and a lot of people are going to be
[57:59] receiving and maybe have some gifts
[58:02] given."
[58:05] And I can tell you before you even tear
[58:07] the wrapping,
[58:10] it may be important and it may not be
[58:13] important.
[58:16] One thing for sure, it won't change your
[58:18] life. But I am going to offer you
[58:23] according to this book.
[58:26] I'm going to offer you
[58:29] a God that knows you
[58:31] &gt;&gt; inside out.
[58:34] And he knows the things that's troubled
[58:36] you
[58:38] all of your life perhaps or for maybe
[58:41] many many years.
[58:44] And maybe you even asked why have you
[58:47] allowed this? Why did you allow this?
[58:54] I'll tell you what you need. You need
[58:56] this gift
[58:58] and it'll answer it in a moment.
[59:01] And I'm going to tell you about you're
[59:03] looking at a man that was filled with
[59:07] huge questions. I was telling the
[59:10] brothers in the back.
[59:15] I saw a group of ministers and I was one
[59:18] of them.
[59:20] And they gathered around a woman that
[59:23] was very oppressed.
[59:26] She was very cast down and she had a
[59:30] heavy spirit with her
[59:33] and I don't know what the problem was
[59:35] even to this day. I don't know what it
[59:37] was, but she was physically
[59:41] in some state.
[59:43] And the ministers around her cast
[59:46] started casting out spirits and they
[59:48] cast out devils.
[59:50] And I didn't know they cast out every
[59:54] devil I even knew ever knew of.
[59:58] And nothing seemed to happen. And when
[1:00:01] they were all done and done their
[1:00:03] praying and exercised in prayer,
[1:00:08] they all went to their seats. I was
[1:00:10] still standing right here. And a woman,
[1:00:14] she's a widow,
[1:00:16] and her husband was a great teacher of
[1:00:18] the scriptures.
[1:00:21] And uh she took up to sending his books
[1:00:25] out,
[1:00:26] and her name was Eaton.
[1:00:29] And this was in a little tent.
[1:00:32] And she stood in front of this woman.
[1:00:34] The woman was right here at the pulpit
[1:00:37] standing. And she stood in front of her
[1:00:39] and she began to quote the scripture.
[1:00:42] That was all she knew. She quoted one
[1:00:45] after the other after the other. And I
[1:00:47] saw her get happy as she quoted the
[1:00:50] scriptures. That's all she had. And she
[1:00:53] quoted the scriptures and she began to
[1:00:56] giggle. and she'd quote another one and
[1:00:59] laugh. And the woman in front of her, I
[1:01:03] saw her face change. I saw her I saw the
[1:01:07] transformation take place and soon she
[1:01:10] entered into she began to smile with the
[1:01:14] lady and and she giggled a little bit
[1:01:18] also. And that woman was completely
[1:01:22] delivered
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; listening to the scriptures
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; being quoted to her by another woman and
[1:01:29] all the ministers you know ministers
[1:01:32] uh eloquent ministers maybe powerful
[1:01:36] preachers I don't know and I was
[1:01:38] standing there with them but I knew that
[1:01:41] something was missing
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; that woman is to be delivered
[1:01:48] and I'm going to tell you now the God
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; that is present.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; You must receive that.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; But that God is present to to be active
[1:02:01] in your life and to give you what you
[1:02:04] have need of. And you need to be able to
[1:02:07] say, "I know
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; when the Messiah cometh,
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; he will tell us all things."
[1:02:17] And you're looking at a man,
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; that was in that same state.
[1:02:25] But I knew one thing
[1:02:28] that what this prophet of God, it was
[1:02:32] another era. I just knew I had never
[1:02:34] heard anything like that before.
[1:02:39] And I had questions on the scripture.
[1:02:45] And
[1:02:48] please hear me out.
[1:02:53] There was one that knew what those
[1:02:56] questions were
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; and he answered those questions.
[1:03:07] If thou kneest,
[1:03:10] if you know, if you behold, if you
[1:03:14] perceive,
[1:03:16] you've asked maybe
[1:03:19] many times, you've asked down in your
[1:03:22] deepest
[1:03:23] self.
[1:03:26] And uh you'll excuse me when I
[1:03:34] When the woman said, "How is it that
[1:03:37] thou being a jou a Jew, how is it that
[1:03:41] you being a message believer,
[1:03:44] how is it that you have these things
[1:03:48] that are
[1:03:50] seemingly
[1:03:51] beyond answer
[1:03:54] and yet
[1:03:56] they should not be a part of your life,
[1:03:59] part of the oppression And I'm not
[1:04:02] speaking defeatism, but that does
[1:04:05] happen.
[1:04:08] And uh
[1:04:12] thank you for your attention.
[1:04:18] She was not, and this is the key,
[1:04:22] she was not completely open
[1:04:26] with everything.
[1:04:30] You know, we are
[1:04:33] capable in this day and in this age of,
[1:04:37] you know, we've cultivated ourselves to
[1:04:40] such a place. We go to church and we
[1:04:44] have we have the answers to so many
[1:04:47] things and and we do. But we become a a
[1:04:52] word
[1:04:53] which is koi.
[1:04:56] C O Y. We become koi and that is we
[1:05:01] become incapable of
[1:05:04] coming to
[1:05:06] a very sensitive part of our life.
[1:05:10] We uh so he said, "How is it that thou
[1:05:14] being a Jew
[1:05:17] askest of me which am a Samaritan?" That
[1:05:21] was a big question in her mind.
[1:05:24] And then now I'm going to give you a
[1:05:28] great secret
[1:05:30] that I have found in throughout my life
[1:05:33] and that's this that you can bring
[1:05:35] people and when you contact or start to
[1:05:39] contact their spirit
[1:05:42] they're willing and open to speak to you
[1:05:44] about spiritual things but they don't
[1:05:47] come right to the problem.
[1:05:51] And brother Brandham said
[1:05:54] he he said this
[1:06:00] he said the Samaritan woman was willing
[1:06:05] to speak about what the Jews and
[1:06:08] Samaritans now I'm sorry that's not the
[1:06:10] exact quote but nevertheless the woman
[1:06:13] was willing to speak about what was the
[1:06:16] Jews and Samaritans what they believed
[1:06:19] believed and where they worshiped etc.
[1:06:24] She said how is it that the the she said
[1:06:28] I know that the Jews worship in
[1:06:30] Jerusalem
[1:06:32] and she turns religious right away
[1:06:35] and is willing to speak and is able to
[1:06:38] speak of those things. I know the Jews
[1:06:41] say we should worship here and we
[1:06:44] Samaritans say they should worship in
[1:06:46] this mountain. I don't know where
[1:06:50] where where is the place that you really
[1:06:53] worship.
[1:06:54] And Jesus said if you knew the gift of
[1:06:57] God and who it is that is speaking to
[1:07:00] you.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to say to you
[1:07:04] today. If you knew the gift of God, what
[1:07:07] is the gift of God? A prophet. God sends
[1:07:10] Elijah the prophet to let you know that
[1:07:15] God is not He says he says these words,
[1:07:19] "God's in the universe. Do you believe
[1:07:21] it?" The people believe it.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; He said God's in his son. Do you believe
[1:07:26] it? Yes, we believe that God's in his
[1:07:31] people.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Well, if you as long as you don't mean
[1:07:37] me.
[1:07:40] Because if you only knew my flaws,
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; he knows their He knows that. He knows
[1:07:48] those flaws.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; He knows all about it.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Before you even came on the scene, he
[1:07:55] chose
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; to be recognized
[1:08:01] in you and with you. Amen.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; And you know
[1:08:07] uh we become so
[1:08:10] efficient at covering it up and not
[1:08:15] really coming to the subject
[1:08:18] and that was her case.
[1:08:24] So he said what she was not able to do
[1:08:28] go and get your husband.
[1:08:31] He was contacting her spirit
[1:08:34] right then. Go and get her husband.
[1:08:38] Well, she said, "I I have no husband."
[1:08:41] And Jesus said, "You've spoken the
[1:08:44] truth.
[1:08:46] You've had five."
[1:08:48] Her eyes flashed. I'm sure.
[1:08:53] What? What kind of man is this?
[1:08:56] You've had five, but the one you have
[1:08:58] now is not your husband.
[1:09:01] in that you've spoken the truth.
[1:09:06] She says, "I know that when the Messiah
[1:09:08] comes, he'll tell us all things."
[1:09:11] She achd for that moment.
[1:09:15] I that speak to thee am he.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; You know, you know the God of this word.
[1:09:24] You know the God of this
[1:09:27] Bible is God in his word. Yes, you
[1:09:30] believe it. Yes. Is God in his son? Yes.
[1:09:34] Because that's way in the past sometime.
[1:09:38] But is God in his people?
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; That's the question.
[1:09:47] Is that God right here?
[1:09:50] Is that God who can contact
[1:09:55] somehow
[1:09:56] we put that off and put it out there?
[1:09:59] some place where we don't have to deal
[1:10:01] with it. Don't do that.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:04] Bring it right here.
[1:10:08] God, in this service,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; God, in this
[1:10:13] tabernacle, this sanctuary,
[1:10:17] God, you've heard my confessions.
[1:10:20] You've heard my worship.
[1:10:24] You've heard me say things. You've heard
[1:10:27] me say I love you
[1:10:32] and I'm sorry.
[1:10:36] Maybe I didn't say it with a surrendered
[1:10:38] life that I should have
[1:10:42] that I want to have.
[1:10:46] And I am going to
[1:10:53] I wonder if you'd play an audio part.
[1:11:05] Yes, that'll be fine.
[1:11:08] Please.
[1:11:11] Now, as this is being played,
[1:11:14] your brother at is standing here was on
[1:11:18] the platform.
[1:11:20] I perhaps had more questions than you
[1:11:23] have
[1:11:26] because I was bewildered and in a
[1:11:28] dilemma
[1:11:30] when I was just standing just where
[1:11:33] Thomas seated.
[1:11:36] I may have been seated. I don't
[1:11:38] remember. But I was there and I heard
[1:11:39] this. I was there.
[1:11:43] So would you please play it?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Just break that little bed of blackness
[1:11:48] there and watch the Holy Spirit fall on
[1:11:49] this building and every person in here
[1:11:51] be healed. Will you believe it?
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Stand up on your feet and accept it then
[1:11:55] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Raise up your hands now to him. Say, "I
[1:12:00] believe you, Lord.
[1:12:02] I
[1:12:04] love him.
[1:12:07] I
[1:12:09] love you.
[1:12:12] [Applause]
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; I'm broken because I was there.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, your heart. Just raise your hands
[1:12:24] high and praise him. Say, "Thank you,
[1:12:26] Lord Jesus."
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; What's the matter, soldier boy?
[1:12:35] You're not going to commit suicide.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; The devil's lying to you, boy.
[1:12:46] You've only got a phobia.
[1:12:50] He's lying to you. He'll drive insane if
[1:12:52] you believe. Deny,
[1:12:55] renounce the devil. I command you in the
[1:12:58] name of Jesus Christ to renounce the
[1:13:00] devil and accept Jesus Christ as your
[1:13:02] healer. You'll go back and be a
[1:13:03] gentleman and a real real man. Do you do
[1:13:06] that? Raise up your hands to God and
[1:13:07] say, "Praise God." That's right. Oh,
[1:13:10] amen. I go back for me. Be well.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Said, "You'll go back."
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And be a real gentleman and be a real
[1:13:21] man.
[1:13:23] On the way back,
[1:13:26] they passed us
[1:13:30] and I stopped in a town. It was a little
[1:13:33] mud town called Fort Nelson,
[1:13:37] 300 miles
[1:13:40] from where this was song was being sung
[1:13:46] and I was on the platform listening to
[1:13:48] this.
[1:13:50] How strange. Sure.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; How strange it was to have somebody in
[1:13:56] the middle of a course. I love him.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I love him. It was a normal service to
[1:14:06] me.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Because he first What's the matter,
[1:14:11] soldier boy? That was different.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; That was a service like I didn't I
[1:14:18] couldn't predict. You'll not commit
[1:14:21] suicide, soldier boy.
[1:14:26] Everyone started looking for the soldier
[1:14:28] boy. That's not the point.
[1:14:32] You'll not commit suicide, soldier boy.
[1:14:34] That's the devil talking to you.
[1:14:38] The next day they passed us.
[1:14:44] And when we had gotten to Fort Nelson,
[1:14:48] I said to Brother Brandham, I said, "You
[1:14:49] know, it's about 2:00.
[1:14:52] By the time we get to Southwick's,
[1:14:55] Sister
[1:14:56] uh Southwick will be done the dishes and
[1:14:59] so on. Maybe we should have something to
[1:15:02] eat right now." He said, "I think
[1:15:05] that'll be a good I think that would be
[1:15:07] a good idea, Brother Eddie." So, we just
[1:15:10] pulled off the highway onto a little
[1:15:11] side road,
[1:15:15] potholes, rough gravel, and we're
[1:15:19] jostling up and park the car.
[1:15:23] And we go in,
[1:15:27] and there's Chris Berg, Brother
[1:15:30] Brandham, and myself.
[1:15:34] And uh
[1:15:38] in the door comes
[1:15:40] we had just ordered our soup
[1:15:43] and the waitress had gone
[1:15:46] and uh the door opened. It was just over
[1:15:50] here. The door opened little aluminum
[1:15:53] door and in walked two men.
[1:15:58] The one man I hadn't seen before
[1:16:02] and the tall young man I had seen,
[1:16:06] he was probably six foot,
[1:16:09] probably your size, brother Carrie
[1:16:13] and his eyes were quite his face was
[1:16:17] drawn
[1:16:19] and he
[1:16:22] this man little heavier set man
[1:16:27] uh crowded by him and came around in
[1:16:31] front of brother Brandham and thrust his
[1:16:33] hand down. He says, "Brother Brandham,"
[1:16:37] he says, "so you remember calling out
[1:16:39] the soldier boy?"
[1:16:42] And he put his hand up and he was kind
[1:16:44] of shaking. He said, he looked at me. He
[1:16:47] said, "Do you do you remember, brother
[1:16:48] Eddie?" I said, "Yes. You said you'll
[1:16:52] not commit suicide, soldier boy. That's
[1:16:54] the devil talking to you." He said,
[1:16:57] "That's it. That's what you said. That's
[1:16:59] what you said."
[1:17:01] And uh he said, "This is him.
[1:17:05] Would you pray for him?"
[1:17:08] He said, "Uh, I brought him down from
[1:17:10] Fairbanks
[1:17:12] to be in your meeting
[1:17:15] so that you could pray for him, but I
[1:17:17] couldn't get him in the healing line."
[1:17:21] And so, just then, the waitress came and
[1:17:24] slid our soup. In fact, as I can tell
[1:17:26] you, it was pea soup. And she slid it in
[1:17:31] front of us and uh just went on her way.
[1:17:35] And brother Brandham said, "Uh,
[1:17:39] well, maybe we'll just have our soup."
[1:17:44] I thought, "Have our soup?" You know,
[1:17:48] here's a boy is trying to commit
[1:17:50] suicide.
[1:17:52] three times commit suicide in the last
[1:17:55] year and we got our soup and we're not
[1:17:59] going to pray for him. I thought that
[1:18:02] was one of the awakening things I had.
[1:18:08] If God's going to do something, a bowl
[1:18:10] of soup doesn't make any difference.
[1:18:14] So, we
[1:18:17] uh
[1:18:19] they said, "Well, we're going to have a
[1:18:20] bite to eat, too." So they went down a
[1:18:24] few booths and sat down
[1:18:28] and uh
[1:18:31] brother Brandham he said now I saw he he
[1:18:35] had changed. He was burdened again. Now
[1:18:40] it it was not just uh to go out in the
[1:18:43] mountains and hunt. You know the people
[1:18:45] at home maybe thought that but here he's
[1:18:49] always exposed to the burdens of the
[1:18:52] people
[1:18:54] and he he said uh I think there was a
[1:18:58] woman yesterday he said in the healing
[1:19:01] line
[1:19:03] and uh she's blind.
[1:19:06] I said, "Uh, I can't remember her."
[1:19:11] Because they had the ministers all lined
[1:19:13] up and just laying their hands on the
[1:19:16] sick. I said, "I can't remember any
[1:19:19] blind woman."
[1:19:21] Yeah. Brother Berg said, "I think there
[1:19:24] was a blind woman
[1:19:27] uh in the healing line." And brother
[1:19:30] Brham said, "He's just listening, but
[1:19:34] he's not paying much attention." He
[1:19:36] said, "Just a moment." And he looked
[1:19:39] just over my head
[1:19:41] and looked like he was looking into
[1:19:45] eternity or someplace
[1:19:48] and he said, "Yes."
[1:19:51] He said, "It's uh let's see."
[1:19:55] And he's looking, he's watching
[1:19:57] something.
[1:19:58] He said, "Yes, she's a young German
[1:20:01] woman."
[1:20:03] And uh let's see. Oh, he said, "I see
[1:20:07] now she has given up her place in the
[1:20:10] prayer line to lead the blind woman
[1:20:13] through."
[1:20:18] He looked at me and said, "That's
[1:20:20] right."
[1:20:23] And then I just listened. I knew now
[1:20:26] that he was off someplace else.
[1:20:30] And he said, "Yes, she's a young German
[1:20:33] woman." He looked at he kind of shook
[1:20:35] his head and looked at me and we're
[1:20:37] eating soup.
[1:20:41] I can tell you soup doesn't stop God.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; I can tell you this meeting doesn't stop
[1:20:48] God.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; The fact we've got microphones and
[1:20:53] speakers, etc., and you're set again.
[1:20:55] That doesn't stop God.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; The question is, is God coming near to
[1:21:02] you to contact your spirit? If he is,
[1:21:07] then he has some answer for you.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; You can make contact with him.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Yes."
[1:21:17] Just a young German woman. He looked at
[1:21:20] me. He said, "You see, brother Eddie,"
[1:21:22] he said, "she may be praying just now."
[1:21:26] I, Brother John, Brother Tom, I was
[1:21:29] completely
[1:21:31] bewildered.
[1:21:33] She could be praying right now. We're up
[1:21:36] in the wilderness someplace. How are we
[1:21:39] going to know she's praying?
[1:21:43] He said,
[1:21:45] "She has perhaps some things that she
[1:21:49] was she's in need."
[1:21:52] And he just listened for a few moments
[1:21:55] and looked said, "Yes, she's a young
[1:21:58] German woman. Starts all over again."
[1:22:03] And her name, he said, "I'll ask him.
[1:22:08] I'll ask him. Come see a man." Yes,
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; I'll ask him.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And he'll give me her name. And he was
[1:22:18] just silent a moment and he said, "Yes,
[1:22:23] her name is Sister Fear." He said, "We
[1:22:26] would say fair."
[1:22:28] She's a young German woman. Her name is
[1:22:31] Sister Fair. And he shook his head just
[1:22:34] a moment. He said, "You see, she could
[1:22:36] be praying just now.
[1:22:41] I thought,
[1:22:45] what kind of a what kind of an
[1:22:48] experience is this?
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; What kind of a preacher is this?
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Who will know that she's praying just
[1:23:01] now? Praying for what?
[1:23:04] And she had had no idea
[1:23:08] that 300 miles of the Alaskan Highway,
[1:23:12] 300
[1:23:13] miles, 500 miles from where she is
[1:23:18] praying. And I got in touch with my
[1:23:21] father, my dad, who lived in Dawson
[1:23:24] Creek, about 200 miles from her. I said,
[1:23:28] "Can you find Sister Far?"
[1:23:32] I said, "This is what happened." And he
[1:23:35] said, "She lives down in a certain town,
[1:23:39] I think White Court, something like
[1:23:42] that. And she was praying.
[1:23:48] I don't know what she was praying or
[1:23:50] what she was saying, but here was a
[1:23:53] prophet of God, and that was what I was
[1:23:56] introduced to." Now friends,
[1:24:01] the soldier boy,
[1:24:03] we had already
[1:24:06] left
[1:24:07] of Fort Nelson. We're driving up and and
[1:24:13] we have a second portion. I just want to
[1:24:16] a second audio portion. Could we play
[1:24:18] that, please? The second one,
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; the woman's moving back from
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; the lady is suffering with a tremendous
[1:24:35] nervous condition.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; He's talking to a woman.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Spiritual problems that bother her.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Her name is Sister Clint. K L the truth.
[1:24:44] Raise up your hand.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; A good friend of my family.
[1:24:50] She's standing just in front of me.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Last time I said you guessed that,
[1:24:52] Brother Brandham. Let me talk to her a
[1:24:54] little more. She's a fine person and the
[1:24:56] anointing's on her. Let me just say this
[1:24:58] to you. I don't know the woman. Never
[1:25:00] spoke to her till just now. But that
[1:25:02] woman is aware that something's on her
[1:25:04] right now. A real sweet holy feeling. If
[1:25:07] that's right, raise up your hand, lady.
[1:25:09] Now, she's the Canadian here with you.
[1:25:13] See, I'm looking right at it. That it
[1:25:15] isn't a glare. It's a glow. amber light
[1:25:18] right around the you say how do you see
[1:25:20] it and I don't well it's another
[1:25:22] dimension how did Paul see that pillar
[1:25:25] of fire down there and damper with him
[1:25:27] didn't see it
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; how the wise man see the star that led
[1:25:31] him to Jesus and no observatory ever
[1:25:33] reported it mystic star in the sky for
[1:25:37] two years nobody saw it but the wise man
[1:25:40] because they were the only ones looking
[1:25:42] for it
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know what I told you the only
[1:25:46] way I know is on I hate them. But
[1:25:48] whatever it said was right.
[1:25:51] Now, let's just see again. Yes. Nervous.
[1:25:58] Your trouble comes mainly about this
[1:26:00] time of day, late in the evening, when
[1:26:01] you're really fatigued, wore out, have
[1:26:04] real funny, weary feelings come on you.
[1:26:07] That is right. You get nervous once in a
[1:26:09] while and drop things. Not long ago, you
[1:26:11] were standing near a window when a sun
[1:26:12] was going down. You feel real nervous
[1:26:14] rubbing your hand. That's the truth.
[1:26:18] How would I know where you were
[1:26:19] standing? How would I know you did that?
[1:26:21] Before you come to the meeting, you
[1:26:22] prayed to God that you'd get a prayer
[1:26:24] card. You were very happy when you
[1:26:26] received it. That's thus sayaeth the
[1:26:28] Lord. That's true. Here's another thing.
[1:26:31] God tells me that on your heart, you're
[1:26:32] praying for somebody else.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; That's a friend that's a dying. It's got
[1:26:37] cancer. They don't live here. They live
[1:26:39] in Fort St. John. And the person's
[1:26:41] shadow with a dark shadow. That person
[1:26:44] is a sinner dying with cancer. Thus
[1:26:47] sayaeth the Lord.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Are those things true? Raise up your
[1:26:50] hand now. Is there a shadow of doubt in
[1:26:52] your mind? Is he Jesus Christ? Is God
[1:26:55] among his people?
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Do you believe, sister? Take that same
[1:26:58] handkerchief with you. Lay it on the
[1:27:00] person and don't doubt. Jesus Christ
[1:27:02] will make him well. Don't believe.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it all?
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; I was in the car.
[1:27:07] We were driving past Fort St. John and
[1:27:10] the first exit into the and I read in
[1:27:13] his obituary, this man's obituary last
[1:27:17] night.
[1:27:20] You know what obituary is? That's read
[1:27:23] at the funeral.
[1:27:27] Now, here he is calling him out.
[1:27:32] And then he's talking now to a woman
[1:27:35] that I know is a very close friend of
[1:27:38] ours. went to our church
[1:27:42] when they were in Dawson Creek and they
[1:27:44] were in Fort lived in Fort St. John. Now
[1:27:46] we're just coming to through Fort St.
[1:27:48] John on the Alaskan Highway. The prophet
[1:27:51] of God has no idea where we're taking
[1:27:53] him. He just knows that we're driving
[1:27:56] and he's actually driving and I'm
[1:27:58] sitting beside him in the passenger
[1:28:00] side. And there was a big old white
[1:28:03] house
[1:28:05] uh up probably 150 meters up this access
[1:28:10] road and it was the first road into the
[1:28:13] town. They moved the town because the US
[1:28:17] Army built the highway wherever they
[1:28:20] wished it to go and they made it as
[1:28:23] straight as they could right at that
[1:28:25] point. And I often wondered about this
[1:28:28] big old white house. never did know and
[1:28:33] that this man who Sister Clint was
[1:28:36] praying for lived in that house. And
[1:28:41] while we drove, he slowed right back
[1:28:44] down because it was about a 30 mph
[1:28:47] uh zone and brother Brandham is driving
[1:28:51] and he said, "There was a woman praying
[1:28:54] for a man. I believe it was from Fort
[1:28:57] St. John." And I said, I wanted him to
[1:29:01] know. Oh, I know her. She's a good
[1:29:03] friend of our family and well acquainted
[1:29:06] with us. I knew her very very well. And
[1:29:09] now she was standing in front of this
[1:29:11] prophet of God and he was telling her
[1:29:14] and another thing. Now he said someone
[1:29:18] might have said I guessed that but
[1:29:21] another thing you've been praying for.
[1:29:24] He said, "Another thing, God tells me
[1:29:28] that on your heart, you're praying for
[1:29:32] someone else. That's a friend that's
[1:29:35] dying
[1:29:38] that's got cancer. They don't live here
[1:29:42] because we were in Dawson Creek." He
[1:29:44] said they live in Fort St. John and
[1:29:47] we're in Fort St. John.
[1:29:51] And the person is shadowed with a dark
[1:29:55] shadow. That person is a sinner dying
[1:30:00] with cancer. That's thus sayaeth the
[1:30:03] Lord. And while we drive by slowly, he
[1:30:08] has to put his hand and he puts it
[1:30:10] behind my head. And he said, "The man's
[1:30:12] in that house."
[1:30:15] When I got to to to brother Southwick's
[1:30:20] place, I'm anxious to tell him what a
[1:30:22] prophet is. So I'm saying, you know,
[1:30:26] Fort St. John, I said, you know, that
[1:30:28] big white house. I said, we're just
[1:30:30] going by it. And brother Brandham put
[1:30:32] swings his hand out and and because of
[1:30:35] the movement of the car, he puts it
[1:30:37] behind my head and he said, "The man's
[1:30:40] in that house." Brother Southwick says,
[1:30:45] "Well, I know that's Ed Thomas.
[1:30:48] I know him." He said, "He
[1:30:53] and I know he's dying with cancer."
[1:30:57] I said, "Well, you know, Sister Clint,
[1:30:59] she was praying for him and standing on
[1:31:02] the on the platform and here I am
[1:31:06] sitting just a few feet away and I see
[1:31:10] her
[1:31:12] and I'm listening to every word. Now
[1:31:15] you're listening to me.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Are you listening to every word?
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; This happened." Amen.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; A man that I'm introducing to you was
[1:31:27] telling this prophet of God and speaking
[1:31:31] through his mouth and telling him,
[1:31:34] "She's praying for a man. He's a sinner
[1:31:37] man. He's dying with cancer. He died two
[1:31:41] months later or three months later. He
[1:31:44] died in July."
[1:31:46] uh according to the internet, he died in
[1:31:50] July
[1:31:52] and uh uh he and and his wife wrote a
[1:31:57] great obituary about him and told where
[1:32:00] they were living. And I found and just
[1:32:03] read it this last week where he was
[1:32:06] living and when they moved to that place
[1:32:09] and when he built that house and raised
[1:32:12] his family in that house. Listen
[1:32:14] friends, this isn't some play game.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; This is God, a living God. You have been
[1:32:25] called by a living God.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; He knows every detail of your life. He
[1:32:30] knows your burdens right now. He's
[1:32:33] contacting your spirit to let you know
[1:32:37] that he's alive and he's ready to deal
[1:32:40] with every situation.
[1:32:43] Do you believe that?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; You think that he may be unaware and
[1:32:49] somehow maybe because you can speak of
[1:32:53] religious things. Oh, I I go to Bible
[1:32:56] way and what does that mean?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; It it doesn't mean anything. What it
[1:33:02] really means is that there's a God
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; in this world. He chose to come here to
[1:33:10] this world and through Jesus Christ
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; who is the God man.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; And this is something that I have great
[1:33:22] difficulty but I'm going to try to
[1:33:24] explain it to you. That was the man. He
[1:33:27] went to the cross as a man but it was
[1:33:31] God in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:33:36] himself. He was making a way.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; He was being your uh uh propitiation.
[1:33:44] Uh he was being your sacrifice. You
[1:33:48] needed a sacrifice.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; You're hell bound.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Without God, without the sacrifice,
[1:33:54] you're hell bound. There's no way for
[1:33:57] you to be saved. But but through him
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; and he gave himself
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; freely to you.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Freely
[1:34:07] no questions asked.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask this woman to tell about
[1:34:11] her life. What about your first husband?
[1:34:14] What about your second? What about the
[1:34:15] third? What about the fourth? What about
[1:34:18] the fifth? He didn't. Now the Messiah
[1:34:21] was there
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; to deal with that thing
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; and she said, "Come see a man.
[1:34:30] and that's what I'm saying to you.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Come see a man,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; not a man,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; not not William Brandham, not brother Ed
[1:34:41] Biscoll, but come and see a man that
[1:34:44] knows every detail. It's none other than
[1:34:48] the living God.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; And he chose to come in the form of this
[1:34:54] message. This message only relates I had
[1:34:58] all kinds of questions about it and uh
[1:35:03] this man
[1:35:06] a man that God had under his control.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; A prophet of God. And you may have a
[1:35:13] question about that right now. When did
[1:35:17] when was that prophet under complete
[1:35:20] control of the Holy Spirit? I can tell
[1:35:24] you a friend, when he uttered those
[1:35:26] words, that was God speaking.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; God spoke to my wife
[1:35:32] whose daddy was hanging between life and
[1:35:35] death.
[1:35:38] I flew her up.
[1:35:40] I flew her up. The man that's standing
[1:35:43] behind this pulpit flew the sister
[1:35:46] that's sitting back there listening to
[1:35:49] me. And she could only look at her
[1:35:52] father
[1:35:54] for 10 minutes of a day and that was it.
[1:35:59] And could not utter a word. Couldn't say
[1:36:02] anything to him. His heart might stop.
[1:36:06] His main artery had ruptured and but had
[1:36:10] not burst but had ruptured but it was on
[1:36:12] the verge of bursting. And if he did,
[1:36:15] he'd just expire.
[1:36:18] and she's standing there and I called a
[1:36:21] doctor, Dr. O'Brien in Dawson Creek and
[1:36:25] I said, "Uh, should I fly my wife up?"
[1:36:30] "Yeah." I said, "I think you better."
[1:36:32] So, I flew her up.
[1:36:35] But we have three daughters that are all
[1:36:38] here this morning,
[1:36:41] and
[1:36:42] she's mother to them.
[1:36:47] And brother Brandham was in Victoria
[1:36:51] and he had meetings there. You have it
[1:36:53] on tape. Three in Grand Prairie. I'm
[1:36:57] sorry. Three in Grand Prairie. Yes. And
[1:36:59] three in Dawson Creek. But the year
[1:37:02] before, the next year, we had three in
[1:37:06] uh Portal Bernie and three in Victoria.
[1:37:09] And she was holding this in her heart
[1:37:11] all the time.
[1:37:14] I don't know who was there. I was there.
[1:37:18] But my wife wrote the ads for the
[1:37:21] newspaper
[1:37:24] and was playing. There were two
[1:37:26] Pentecostal churches that I had attended
[1:37:30] both
[1:37:32] and one hosted brother Brandham in
[1:37:35] Saskatoon in 1947
[1:37:38] and they would not cooperate with this
[1:37:41] meeting.
[1:37:45] It's hard to say, but it's true.
[1:37:49] And I called the pent main Pentecostal
[1:37:51] church and invited them to be in the
[1:37:54] meeting.
[1:37:57] He said, "Well, we have a camp." So I
[1:38:00] said, "Well, that's fine."
[1:38:02] So he excused himself.
[1:38:06] And so that was three churches invited.
[1:38:10] We just have this service starting. My I
[1:38:13] think my wife or sister Opel McGriff's
[1:38:15] at the piano. I'm on the platform
[1:38:19] and Brother Brandham is going to come
[1:38:21] out shortly
[1:38:23] and a woman comes up and she said
[1:38:26] she's from Christ Church Cathedral in
[1:38:29] Victoria.
[1:38:31] That's the church the queen goes to.
[1:38:35] You talk about a stuffy church. That's a
[1:38:38] stuffy church.
[1:38:41] Anglican church. She came up and she
[1:38:44] said, "You need somebody playing the
[1:38:47] piano. You need somebody at the organ."
[1:38:51] We're I think we're singing Only Believe
[1:38:53] or something. And she sat and began to
[1:38:56] play the organ. And she was the woman
[1:38:59] that played the organ for those
[1:39:01] meetings.
[1:39:04] Somebody
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; who claimed to be a real Christian
[1:39:09] really missed out.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; They had an opportunity.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; And here God's prophet
[1:39:21] who is uttering and speaking to people
[1:39:25] who I knew
[1:39:27] and they're missing it.
[1:39:30] And this woman comes up. When I say they
[1:39:33] are, they had been invited to play and
[1:39:37] partake of those beatings.
[1:39:39] And they did.
[1:39:42] Friends,
[1:39:45] God is in his people.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; And when you shake hands with somebody
[1:39:54] today,
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; And if you're here in this service, Yes,
[1:39:58] sir.
[1:39:59] Make yourself accessible.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Make yourself
[1:40:04] visible
[1:40:07] and make yourself available
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; to God's people.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, nice to see you. Thank you
[1:40:15] for being here.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I trust this will be a blessing to you.
[1:40:26] said, "What was Brother Brenham's
[1:40:27] ministry?"
[1:40:31] His ministry was this, and I'm going to
[1:40:34] do it like he did it.
[1:40:37] God is in the universe.
[1:40:40] Said, "Do you believe it?" The people
[1:40:41] said, "Amen."
[1:40:43] He said, "God is in his word."
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:40:50] He said God is in his son.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; And he says God is in his people.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what we are called here to
[1:41:04] believe.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; God, this God
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; is in his people. Amen.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; And I wonder if he's maybe touching your
[1:41:16] heart, touching your spirit, not
[1:41:19] touching your emotions, but touching
[1:41:20] your spirit.
[1:41:24] And maybe you've had
[1:41:27] very very deep
[1:41:30] questions. Yeah, we can talk about
[1:41:33] spiritual things. We can talk about the
[1:41:35] church. We can talk about well, I
[1:41:37] worship here. Will you worship there?
[1:41:43] That's not the question.
[1:41:51] You see me here in this service,
[1:41:56] but we had to give up everything.
[1:42:00] I had people call me and cancel meetings
[1:42:05] because
[1:42:06] now I was tainted with William Brham's
[1:42:09] name.
[1:42:11] But I can tell you and I tell you by a
[1:42:14] declaration.
[1:42:16] I wouldn't trade any of those brothers
[1:42:20] testimony for the testimony of this
[1:42:23] message which I've received it. You talk
[1:42:27] about it it answering all of your
[1:42:30] questions. I said
[1:42:33] I had three questions and and people
[1:42:37] hear about that. When those three
[1:42:39] questions were answered, my whole life
[1:42:41] was exposed.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Whole life. The whole life.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; There's something about it. There's
[1:42:49] something about God's word.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; There's something about it. And I don't
[1:42:54] want you to get lost in the terminology
[1:42:56] of God's word, but there's something
[1:42:59] about the scriptures. There's something
[1:43:02] about a certain light that comes from
[1:43:06] another place.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; It's a divine light.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; And it may be that halo. I don't know. I
[1:43:14] couldn't care less. I don't know what
[1:43:17] kind of light it is. I don't know where
[1:43:19] it came from. Uh-huh.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; All I know is a a light
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; is shed.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; And explodes
[1:43:29] in your heart
[1:43:31] and all questions
[1:43:35] people asked me and they were
[1:43:37] irreverent.
[1:43:40] And one man asked me, he was a minister.
[1:43:43] I think he was certainly religious. And
[1:43:47] he said to me, he didn't even have the
[1:43:49] respect to say, "Brother Brandham." He
[1:43:52] said, "What attracted you to Brandham's
[1:43:56] ministry?"
[1:43:58] That's what he said.
[1:44:01] I said, "Well,
[1:44:03] every time he spoke,
[1:44:09] this book became alive."
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Is that your testimony?
[1:44:16] Then I'm with friends. Every time he
[1:44:18] spoke, this book became alive.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; I said it didn't take much intelligence
[1:44:25] to determine whoever is the author of
[1:44:28] this book was speaking through those
[1:44:30] lips.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what attracted me
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; when he opened his mouth. when when all
[1:44:38] of that happened up in Fort Nelson
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; and we were driving on a rough uh road,
[1:44:46] access road, I just said, I just stepped
[1:44:50] out of the Bible.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; I've just stepped out of the Bible.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; I've just stepped out of the pages of
[1:44:58] the Bible. That's what has drawn me to
[1:45:02] this. And the fact that people come or
[1:45:05] people go, that's up to them what they
[1:45:09] do. I can tell you one thing. It's a
[1:45:12] living thing. It's a living testimony. I
[1:45:16] thought of you, Brother Milco, and and
[1:45:18] the people in uh in Yugoslavia, the
[1:45:22] former Yugoslavia, and all the
[1:45:24] supernatural things that took place.
[1:45:28] That's this man.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Come see a man. people disregarded him
[1:45:34] and fell and we don't want to even talk
[1:45:36] about that. But we had a Pentecostal
[1:45:41] minister. He wanted to print this
[1:45:43] message.
[1:45:45] But he had other things in his mind
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; and he stood right beside the printing
[1:45:50] press at 30 37 to 38 years old and
[1:45:55] dropped dead
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; right there printing this message. Those
[1:46:04] things are not easy to get. His wife
[1:46:06] remained a believer for years. Those
[1:46:09] were things that we experienced.
[1:46:14] Friends, you talk about writing a book.
[1:46:17] We could write a volume of a book. But
[1:46:20] God has People are not sitting here
[1:46:24] because
[1:46:25] of their health. They're not sitting
[1:46:28] here because I don't have another church
[1:46:31] to go to. They're sitting here because
[1:46:34] something has gripped them.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Something somebody
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; has gripped them.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; And all I can say to you, come and see a
[1:46:45] man.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; I introduce you to a man.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; The same man the woman talked to.
[1:46:57] How is it that thou being a Jew? How is
[1:47:01] it that you being a Christian? How is it
[1:47:03] that you've been engaged
[1:47:07] are here
[1:47:10] to hear this? It's not even a sermon as
[1:47:14] such.
[1:47:15] But how is it maybe you could speak
[1:47:18] about things and handle yourself and
[1:47:22] maneuver things around and talk about
[1:47:25] the message or talk about
[1:47:29] but you know
[1:47:31] there's something missing yet.
[1:47:36] You know there's something missing.
[1:47:40] This man
[1:47:43] that I introduce you to is the one
[1:47:47] where an honest prophet of God
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; would say,
[1:47:53] "I don't believe I've known you. I don't
[1:47:56] know you."
[1:47:58] He said, "I see you've been prayed for
[1:48:01] before."
[1:48:04] uh said, "Yes, a man that's
[1:48:09] kind of got thinning his hair."
[1:48:12] He's prayed, "You've been prayed for in
[1:48:15] a big meeting before."
[1:48:18] He said, "Why? It's me."
[1:48:22] He said, "It's me." When he sees it
[1:48:25] refocused, I suppose in the vision, he
[1:48:28] said, "It's me. You were in a meeting of
[1:48:30] mine and I prayed for you before." And
[1:48:33] uh she said, "That's right.
[1:48:38] I like that kind of honesty."
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, you have been introduced
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; to a Christ.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; He knows everything about tomorrow.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; He knows everything about the rest of
[1:48:57] your life. He knows every person. He
[1:49:00] knows every detail. And not only that,
[1:49:02] he knows it, but he's got it in control.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Absolutely has it in control.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Would you stand with me and I'm going to
[1:49:14] pray.
[1:49:22] Lord, I'm going to ask you
[1:49:25] to come by
[1:49:28] come by our way.
[1:49:31] Come by the people's way.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Come by these that are standing here.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; And I have given witness
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; of the things that you have done.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; You're the living God.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; It's a true testimony.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; It's a true work.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; You're here, oh father,
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; bless your holy
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; living in your people.
[1:50:00] living in your servants.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Help us
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; to receive as we ought to receive.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Help us, Father.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; There are people here that I
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; dearly love. Oh God,
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; and this congregation is full of people.
[1:50:22] Father,
[1:50:24] may they know and may they feel.
[1:50:28] Oh, God.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; I bring them to you.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; I offer them to you.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; This is the wrapping
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; you have given, oh God.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:47] It's been crinkled by a lot of things in
[1:50:49] life.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:52] But you are real. And I want to say you
[1:50:56] are more precious.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; I want to say with a man
[1:51:02] that you used mightily,
[1:51:05] he was humble enough to say, "Brother
[1:51:07] Eddie,
[1:51:10] the next time you're talking to him,
[1:51:13] tell him."
[1:51:15] and you feel his presence close, come
[1:51:18] close to you, tell him that brother Bill
[1:51:21] loves him very much.
[1:51:24] And tonight, Lord, today I want to say
[1:51:28] to you before these people,
[1:51:32] we love you
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; very much
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; for all that you have done and all you
[1:51:40] will continue to do.
[1:51:42] Jesus, I want to present these people to
[1:51:45] you.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; And the only gift we have is whatever
[1:51:50] you have given.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Bless them I pray.
[1:51:55] Bless them I pray in Jesus name.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:03] God bless you. You may be seated.
[1:52:14] Would you allow me just to pray a prayer
[1:52:20] although we've just prayed
[1:52:27] brother Brandham said and I was so
[1:52:29] touched by this if you don't mind
[1:52:32] he said shall we bow our heads
[1:52:35] just
[1:52:37] a moment Ed for prayer.
[1:52:40] Our heavenly father,
[1:52:43] as we come into thy presence now,
[1:52:47] dedicating ourselves
[1:52:49] and this building and all that's in here
[1:52:53] for your service. That's what I want to
[1:52:56] say.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:59] realizing that this may be the last time
[1:53:03] that some here will ever hear the gospel
[1:53:07] or be privileged to be in a church
[1:53:10] anymore.
[1:53:12] And this may prove
[1:53:14] the eternal destination of their being.
[1:53:19] So help us,
[1:53:21] Father, tonight to be very reverent, to
[1:53:27] be very loyal to the gospel and to the
[1:53:31] call that thou hast called us unto this
[1:53:35] world.
[1:53:38] And I thank thee, Father, tonight for
[1:53:41] the privilege
[1:53:43] that I have to stand before this
[1:53:46] audience of people.
[1:53:49] I've often thought how I would I cherish
[1:53:55] in my hands a charger
[1:53:58] that held the drop a drop of the blood
[1:54:03] of thy son.
[1:54:06] But I realize tonight I hold greater
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; in this estimation.
[1:54:14] Before me is a purchase of the blood
[1:54:18] that he gave his blood that these might
[1:54:23] become his.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you see why
[1:54:30] I'm exercised is because of that? And
[1:54:33] I'm coming to a close now. So may thy
[1:54:37] spirit direct every word.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; And how we thank
[1:54:44] and how we thank
[1:54:49] for the
[1:54:51] grace of God.
[1:54:54] to know
[1:54:56] that one time we were aliens
[1:54:59] cut off from God
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; without mercy
[1:55:04] without hope.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Christ died for us
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; in ourstead
[1:55:11] bearing our reproach
[1:55:15] and sins in his own body and knowing
[1:55:19] someday that he shall come. We do not
[1:55:24] know
[1:55:25] uh we do not know what we shall be like
[1:55:30] but we know we shall have a body like
[1:55:33] his for we shall be like him.
[1:55:38] Amen. Amen. God bless you my precious
[1:55:43] friends
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; this season. Thank you Sister Athena for
[1:55:49] being here. God bless you,
[1:55:55] Brother Nathan's mom, Sister Charity's
[1:55:58] mom from Idaho. Thank you for being here
[1:56:04] and thank you for giving me this
[1:56:05] opportunity
[1:56:07] to speak to you.
[1:56:10] Come see a man.
[1:56:15] I hope you'll remember. It may not be.
[1:56:19] It may not be today, but it could be
[1:56:23] that he'll come to you in a very
[1:56:25] personal way.
[1:56:28] And I pray that he will. I pray that
[1:56:30] you'll experience some of these things.
[1:56:32] Don't Don't get weary.
[1:56:36] Don't
[1:56:39] give up.
[1:56:41] Don't do that.
[1:56:44] You pursue it.
[1:56:46] And he'll he'll meet you. The man at the
[1:56:50] well,
[1:56:51] he'll meet you.
[1:56:54] I say it in faith. I say it in
[1:56:57] confidence.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; He'll meet you. He didn't bring you this
[1:57:00] far.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't bring you to hear this message
[1:57:04] unless he intended to take you all the
[1:57:07] way.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; I look over this. I know that some of
[1:57:18] you have experienced troublesome times.
[1:57:21] I know that.
[1:57:24] I know that you have reached almost like
[1:57:27] the end of yourself. That's fine. That's
[1:57:32] good. But you'll never reach the end of
[1:57:35] himself.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what to do and how to
[1:57:41] do it.
[1:57:42] He knows exactly
[1:57:44] how to touch you, how to reach and I
[1:57:48] think of I I read it so many times, but
[1:57:52] I read it again and again. I put it he
[1:57:56] said he I'm trying to reach your spirit.
[1:57:59] I'm trying to contact your spirit. And I
[1:58:03] said, "Oh God,
[1:58:06] let these people that sit there and
[1:58:08] listen to these words,
[1:58:12] let them know that someone
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; so much greater."
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Will contact their spirit.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Friends, you can have all the Christmas
[1:58:25] you want,
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; but give me one moment in his presence.
[1:58:32] That's much greater than anything else.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom,
[1:58:53] I feel like the presence has been open.
[1:58:57] Amen. And we're not like brother Bham
[1:58:58] talked about that idiot that was caught
[1:59:00] up with the wrapping paper, but we're
[1:59:03] caught up in the God that was in the
[1:59:06] wrapping. Let's stand to our feet. Let's
[1:59:09] let's just sing beautiful Christ.
[1:59:12] Beautiful Christ.
[1:59:18] Well yeah we can say let me exalt

[2:02:14] Beautiful
[2:02:16] cry.
[2:02:18] Beautiful
[2:02:20] cry.
[2:02:22] My ever glory.
[2:02:29] I wondered this Christmas whether you
[2:02:31] can come and say, "Come see a man.
[2:02:35] Come see a man that's told me all
[2:02:36] things." How many of us could lift up
[2:02:39] our own hearts before God and say, "I
[2:02:42] met that man.
[2:02:44] I met that man." It's not just a story
[2:02:47] of 2,000 years ago, but this Jesus that
[2:02:50] has come down in our day has come to
[2:02:54] meet me and I love him. So, I think it'd
[2:02:58] be fitting to to close this little
[2:03:00] meeting off with I love him. I love him.
[2:03:07] I
[2:03:10] love him.
[2:03:12] [Music]
[2:03:14] I
[2:03:17] love you.

[2:03:42] sal

[2:03:58] tree. Let's bow our heads a word of
[2:04:00] prayer.
[2:04:03] [Music]
[2:04:05] We heard your word this morning, Lord,
[2:04:07] and it spoke deeply into our hearts.
[2:04:13] [Music]
[2:04:15] How often have we read John 4 at the
[2:04:18] woman at the well?
[2:04:20] How many times your prophet used that
[2:04:23] scripture to identify even his ministry
[2:04:28] and the people missed it.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; They missed seeing the Christ in the
[2:04:33] vessel.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; You said the world will see me no more,
[2:04:39] but you shall see me.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; For I'll be with you, even in you to the
[2:04:45] end of the world.
[2:04:49] This great unveiling of Christ is now
[2:04:52] Lord being resident within the flesh of
[2:04:55] your children
[2:04:57] Jesus Christ living in us.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; May this Christmas season we unwrap our
[2:05:05] lives before those that love us
[2:05:09] that they could look within to love you.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us live this life.
[2:05:17] Not just speak about it, but Lord, live
[2:05:21] it and love it.
[2:05:24] Love a message that has come to elevate
[2:05:27] you in all your glory.
[2:05:33] Lord, I pray that you'll be with each
[2:05:36] and every one from the youngest to the
[2:05:38] oldest.
[2:05:40] May this be such a different Christmas
[2:05:45] that not caught up in the frivolous
[2:05:48] things of life,
[2:05:50] but let us come get caught up so that we
[2:05:54] might be carried away with the blessed
[2:05:57] lover of our souls. Would you bless this
[2:06:01] church, Lord? Bless this group of people
[2:06:04] for they are the church, the sons and
[2:06:07] the daughters of God that have witnessed
[2:06:11] this declaration of come see a man and
[2:06:15] we've seen you high and lifted up in all
[2:06:18] your glory. Bless your children as they
[2:06:21] are with their loved ones maybe unsaved.
[2:06:24] May God they be drawn to the God wrapped
[2:06:27] within their lives.
[2:06:29] Use us for the kingdom. Lord, there's
[2:06:32] just maybe this could be our last
[2:06:33] Christmas,
[2:06:35] our last time, Lord.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; To proclaim the glory of God. And wise
[2:06:41] men are still seeking the word made
[2:06:43] flesh. Guide us every step of the way.
[2:06:47] Lord, let this star lead us in the days
[2:06:50] that lay ahead. Bless your children now.
[2:06:53] We pray in Jesus holy name.
[2:06:58] Amen.
[2:06:59] Amen. Well, can we just sing one last
[2:07:02] song?
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Can we sing one last song?
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; One last song. Oh, beautiful star of
[2:07:10] Bethlehem.
[2:07:12] This star that God used today to guide
[2:07:15] us to his word.
[2:07:18] Beautiful
[2:07:19] star of Bethlehem
[2:07:23] shining upon
[2:07:26] [Music]
[2:07:34] and guiding the wise around their way
[2:07:37] unto the place where Jesus lay.
[2:07:40] Beautiful star that let shine on.
[2:07:46] Beautiful star
[2:07:49] of Bethlehem,
[2:07:52] shining on us from the glory
[2:07:56] dawn.

[2:08:02] the land of perfect day. Beautiful star
[2:08:06] that land shine our first rain.
[2:08:10] Beautiful smile, the whole of rest for
[2:08:14] the redeemed, the good and blessed.
[2:08:16] Yonder in glory when the crown is one.
[2:08:22] Jesus now that star brighter and
[2:08:26] brighter.
