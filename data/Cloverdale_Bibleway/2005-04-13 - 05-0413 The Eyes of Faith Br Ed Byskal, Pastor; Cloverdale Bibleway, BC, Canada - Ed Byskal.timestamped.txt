[2:57] [Music]
[3:10] Hallelujah.
[3:13] [Music]
[3:19] We are standing in his presence on holy
[3:25] ground.
[3:27] One more time.
[3:30] We are standing.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, we are standing
[3:36] on holy ground.
[3:41] And I know that there are angels
[3:47] all around.

[3:52] Let us praise
[3:57] Jesus.

[4:03] we are standing
[4:06] in his presence.
[4:11] [Music]
[4:13] Hallelujah.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that that's exactly
[4:17] where we're standing tonight. And if
[4:20] each of us could catch that revelation,
[4:22] what a service we would have.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. from the littlest ones all the way
[4:27] back to the oldest ones down here in the
[4:30] front sitting up in the balcony. If we
[4:33] could really understand that it's in his
[4:35] presence that we currently are standing,
[4:38] what a tremendous time we'll have
[4:40] tonight. Because I don't believe it's
[4:42] something far-fetched, something very
[4:44] hard for us to grasp. We just have to be
[4:46] willing to get out of the way, let the
[4:48] Lord have his way, and it won't be what
[4:50] a service we could have. It'll be what a
[4:53] service we did have because it'll be a
[4:56] reality. Amen. God bless you this
[4:58] evening. It's very good to see each and
[5:00] every one of you here this evening.

[11:55] evening, Father, but we want to see you
[11:57] high and lifted up.
[12:00] We want to see you glorified in this
[12:02] gathering this evening, Lord.
[12:05] Lord, we didn't come to see our pastor,
[12:07] Lord, how we love him so much, Lord.
[12:10] Lord, we came to see you speak through
[12:12] our pastor.
[12:14] We came you to see you, Lord, revealed
[12:17] in our brothers and our sisters gathered
[12:19] around us. Lord, may we be humble enough
[12:22] to see the life of Christ on display.
[12:25] Lord,
[12:28] we love you tonight, Father. We love
[12:30] your appearing, Lord.
[12:33] Come this evening, this humble little
[12:35] gathering. Lord, we don't have a lot to

[14:27] I trust there's
[14:29] a deep down inside each of you tonight
[14:33] that cries out holy,
[14:36] holy to the lamb that was slain. We want
[14:39] to go to prayer at this time and ask
[14:42] brother Madden. Brother Madden if you'd
[14:43] come and
[14:46] take us to the throne of grace this
[14:47] evening in prayer. We've got a testimony
[14:50] from sister Patty. Believe this was
[14:52] several days ago. She says, "I woke up
[14:55] with my left arm almost useless and in
[14:58] very much in pain. So I wrapped it. I
[15:02] believe this was this must have been
[15:03] Sunday." And she came to church anyway
[15:05] with it wrapped and in pain. And during
[15:07] the service says, "It struck me that I
[15:09] just had to believe and confess my
[15:11] healing." And praise the Lord, the pain
[15:14] has gone.
[15:15] [Music]
[15:17] She said, "I just want to take a punch
[15:19] at Satan with my left hand." Amen. Well,
[15:23] all parts of the body are for a use.
[15:26] Amen. We've got a testimony from Brother
[15:27] Tom Frey. He says he'd like to thank the
[15:29] Lord for answering his prayers. Several
[15:32] months ago, we had put in a prayer
[15:34] request regarding insurance requirements
[15:36] on their home and they're thankful to
[15:38] say that the requirements are no longer
[15:39] needed and they're able to move forward.
[15:43] Want to remember Dave Drake
[15:46] uh asked to pray for Tom Miller.
[15:49] Um
[15:51] the prayers that have been put forward
[15:54] have been a benefit and a help as his
[15:56] heart has been responsive.
[15:59] And uh want to remember Sister Pat
[16:01] Drake, Sister Shauna Gruner, and Sister
[16:04] Marge Miller as they're over on
[16:07] Vancouver Island with Tom at this time.
[16:10] [Music]
[16:14] Sister Joanne puts in a request. Please
[16:16] pray for I am at home not well in body.
[16:21] Amen. I know it's the flu season. The
[16:24] devils took a swing at my myself, my
[16:26] family, my wife, my wife and I on the at
[16:29] the same time, the kids. And uh it's no
[16:33] picnic. We just hold on, hold out, hold
[16:36] fast. How many how many remember that
[16:38] service brother Lance preached probably
[16:40] a couple years ago? I don't know if I'll
[16:41] ever be able to forget that. Hold on,
[16:44] hold fast, and hold out. And sometimes
[16:46] that's just all you can do. But the
[16:49] Lord's faithful. Amen.
[16:52] Amen. Sister Leverne Clemens wants to
[16:56] thank all that have been praying for me.
[16:58] Thanks for your caring and concern.
[17:01] Uh she has been very sick for about two
[17:03] weeks. The battle has been won. However,
[17:06] the Lord is victorious and the devil's
[17:08] on the run.
[17:09] Um, she says, "My daughter-in-law has
[17:12] asked for prayer
[17:14] um for her boss.
[17:17] I'm not exactly sure what the problem
[17:20] is. I believe that uh they've been
[17:22] bucked off of a horse and broken several
[17:25] things and pulled some vertebraes. I
[17:27] believe
[17:29] be in surgery on Friday. So asking that
[17:31] the Lord would intervene on their behalf
[17:35] and above all requesting prayer for
[17:37] salvation.
[17:40] Amen. We want to remember my
[17:42] mother-in-law has been caring for a very
[17:44] sick lady for quite some time now. Has
[17:47] had cancer, reoccurring cancer, and is
[17:50] now at the stage where she has to
[17:52] undergo experimental treatments to try
[17:55] and cure the cancer from the body. And
[17:58] basically, I guess they just kill
[18:00] everything in the body that's alive,
[18:02] hoping to squaltch the cancer and then
[18:03] reintroduce life back into the body with
[18:06] uncancered blood and bone marrow and
[18:09] things. So, she's uh she's
[18:13] at her she's at her wit's end. So, we
[18:16] want to ask prayer not only for the
[18:18] healing touch in her body, but that the
[18:19] Lord would provide a healing touch in
[18:22] her soul.
[18:24] request for brother Gary Steey from
[18:27] Hudson Hope. He is at home very sick and
[18:30] body having some internal bleeding.
[18:35] Please pray for DTP employees at the
[18:38] William Brandham Good News Society
[18:40] printing work in India.
[18:43] Uh Sister Mary's six-year-old son died
[18:46] Friday, April 8th due to a brain tumor.
[18:49] He was in the hospital for the last 2 to
[18:51] three days. Her husband is not a
[18:53] believer although he permits her to work
[18:55] for the Lord at the printing pl printing
[18:57] press. Just want to remember those in
[19:00] India
[19:01] and please pray for brother Moses there
[19:04] as well.
[19:06] Many requests but our Lord is mighty in
[19:09] battle.

[19:14] prove himself powerful. Brother

[30:08] [Music]
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Well, I wonder what Jesus wants to do
[30:18] tonight.
[30:20] That's the important question, isn't it?
[30:23] We came with our expectations, but I
[30:25] wonder what his expectation is. So, we
[30:28] can say, "The will of the Lord be done."
[30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we all agree with that. Do
[30:34] whatever he wishes to do. And when the
[30:37] service is over that he's pleased.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what's so means so much to
[30:44] us. Hallelujah.
[30:46] We're happy to be saved, aren't we?
[30:49] Happy to be in his presence tonight.
[30:52] Amen.
[30:54] Well, we uh you've had prayer and there
[30:57] was quite a number of prayer requests.
[30:59] We're going to go to the scriptures
[31:00] right away.
[31:02] But I needed to also, we're going to
[31:05] include in prayer tonight. I wanted I
[31:08] didn't uh have it as an announcement
[31:10] during the service, but we just got word
[31:13] yesterday that our brother David Mamalus
[31:16] passed away very suddenly. And uh he was
[31:21] apparently just in his chair. Uh Sister
[31:24] Mamalus, Sister Paulie was not home. She
[31:29] was actually, I believe, away visiting.
[31:33] I'm not too sure. I understand she was
[31:36] maybe visiting her her family.
[31:39] Uh and uh uh a sister from I believe
[31:44] that works in their office uh found him
[31:48] in his chair, sitting in his chair.
[31:50] Brother Momus has contributed a great
[31:53] work to the bride of Jesus Christ. I
[31:58] always want to respect a man for what he
[32:01] had in his heart to do for God.
[32:04] It's not what we think a person should
[32:06] do. It's what what God put in their
[32:08] heart to do. And he put some wonderful
[32:12] volumes of the message out and probably
[32:15] worked for 20 25 years and had a whole
[32:18] team of people working with him. And so
[32:21] we just want to thank God for his life
[32:25] and pray that God will sustain his wife
[32:29] and uh loved ones. What family? I don't
[32:32] know any of the extended family, but we
[32:36] just want to remember them in prayer.
[32:40] Also, I would like you to be in
[32:43] continuing prayer. Brother Mladden
[32:47] uh is going to be going to Serbia and
[32:50] they have arranged for some meetings to
[32:53] take place. You know, let me just get
[32:57] take this moment. It used to be
[32:59] Yugoslavia which was a number of
[33:01] provinces. Then they had their war over
[33:05] there and there's Macedonia and Bosnia
[33:08] and and uh Serbia and Slovenia and
[33:11] Croatia and all of these different
[33:14] provinces now essentially are nations
[33:17] within their own right and so while a
[33:20] war was continued on and afterwards they
[33:24] were restricted they couldn't travel so
[33:28] prior to that there was a few believers
[33:30] scattered some in Slovenia Ian, some in
[33:33] Croatia, some up in Serbia and so on,
[33:36] but they could not even reach and
[33:38] fellowship with one another. And now
[33:42] it's now possible for them to have free
[33:45] movement and so on. And they have
[33:47] arranged for a camp meeting. This is the
[33:50] first time I believe it's ever taken
[33:52] place. Brother Madden has taken the
[33:54] initiative and has been working with the
[33:56] brothers for weeks now and we have set
[33:59] the meeting up for June I believe 16th
[34:04] and 17th and 18th and they they got a
[34:08] campground belongs to it another
[34:10] denominational church but they're happy
[34:12] to let us use that facility and the Lord
[34:15] willing I will be going there to be with
[34:17] the brothers but the milco plans to fly
[34:19] over and they're going to be coming from
[34:22] Romania and perhaps Bulgaria and and
[34:26] Hungary and different places, Poland,
[34:29] and this is the first time they've had a
[34:31] meeting there. Now, we've labored in
[34:32] this country for well over 20 years and
[34:36] have printed and translated and so on in
[34:39] uh those languages. So, it it I I know
[34:43] that the country needs your prayers. It
[34:45] really needs your prayers. Will I have
[34:48] your support in that? Let's remember
[34:51] these brethren and brother Madden has
[34:53] done a marvelous work in translating and
[34:57] voice over of the messages and the
[34:59] services from here and they go over
[35:02] there on a regular basis constantly
[35:04] going over and people are counting on
[35:06] them almost like for their for their
[35:09] services and some are streaming probably
[35:11] streaming right now and so we're we're
[35:13] very very very
[35:15] burdened for that work and we want to
[35:17] see God move and a powerful way. And uh
[35:22] one of the brothers has taken quite a
[35:24] bit of responsibility. The the camp is
[35:26] ending on Saturday and he's arranged for
[35:28] me to speak in a Pentecostal church I
[35:30] believe in Belgrade on Sunday and I need
[35:34] your prayers. I need your prayers very
[35:36] very much. I've been depending on that.
[35:38] All right, let's just have a word of
[35:40] prayer. Father,
[35:43] the people have prayed and I heard our
[35:46] brother Madden pray and many requests
[35:49] were made. We're asking for more and you
[35:54] are a God of plenty. You're not short on
[35:58] power. You're not short on grace. You're
[36:01] not short on long suffering, Lord. And
[36:04] we need we need your guidance tonight,
[36:07] Father, in the service. So, we're asking
[36:10] for your blessing upon the meeting.
[36:12] Asking for your anointing upon the word.
[36:15] Asking for your anointing of the Holy
[36:17] Spirit upon all the people that hear, oh
[36:20] God, present in those that are not
[36:22] present. And for myself, oh Lord, at
[36:25] standing at the post of duty. We're
[36:27] asking, oh God, for your grace. We are
[36:30] asking Lord on behalf of uh Sister Momus
[36:33] uh the family Lord the loved ones the
[36:36] workers those of his congregation those
[36:40] oh Lord who are touched by his passing
[36:44] you have of your own accord you have
[36:48] called him home and we know oh God that
[36:51] there is a place for him that you have
[36:54] ordained and we thank you for his life
[36:57] we thank you for the labors oh God, the
[36:59] things which you laid upon his heart
[37:02] that he did and the energy which he
[37:04] expended and the flame and the fire, oh
[37:07] God, that will continue on and he has
[37:10] his reward, oh Lord, according to your
[37:13] good pleasure. And I pray, Father, a
[37:16] special grace and comfort upon the
[37:18] family. And now, Lord Jesus, be with us.
[37:21] I ask in a special way just now. Jesus
[37:24] Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:30] Take your Bibles if you would and turn
[37:32] to uh Genesis the 31st chapter.
[37:40] We have a rather lengthy uh scripture
[37:43] reading, but without it, we can't really
[37:45] get the uh background. So, I hope you
[37:48] won't mind. You don't mind reading the
[37:51] Bible anyway. You You're all Bible
[37:53] readers and Bible believers.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] uh chapter 31.
[38:02] Now, I just give you just a wee bit of
[38:03] background. This is concerning
[38:07] Jacob and his father-in-law, Laban.
[38:10] And most of you know, but for those of
[38:12] you who don't, he worked seven years for
[38:16] the wife he didn't expect and got Leah.
[38:20] And then he worked another seven years
[38:21] for the wife that he wanted and he got
[38:24] Rachel. So, he worked 14 years. And
[38:27] besides those 14 years, he worked
[38:29] another six years. And he spent 20 years
[38:32] working for his father-in-law. That is
[38:35] tough, believe me.
[38:39] Anyway, he managed to make his way
[38:41] through 20 years. And he he he must have
[38:46] had more than respect for his
[38:47] father-in-law because he must have
[38:48] feared him. And he wanted to leave. He
[38:52] wanted to cut the ties and get away. So,
[38:55] he thought he had to pretty well escape.
[38:58] And so, his father-in-law, Laban, was
[39:01] away uh shearing sheep. And Jacob
[39:05] thought, "This is it. This is the time.
[39:08] I'll I'll flee now." So, he put his
[39:11] wives under notice and all his people
[39:14] and so on. And he had huge flocks by
[39:16] this time. And they are he he said, "I'm
[39:20] history."
[39:22] And away he went. And he was gone in
[39:25] about three days journey when Laban
[39:27] heard about it. And Laban was not a
[39:31] happy camper. He was not pleased. And so
[39:35] we're in the midst of that. We're going
[39:37] to read about them meeting. All right.
[39:39] And uh and it was 22nd verse. And it was
[39:44] told Laban on the third day that Jacob
[39:46] was fled and he took his brethren with
[39:49] him and pursued after him seven days
[39:52] journey. And they overtook him in the
[39:55] mount Gilead. And God came to Laban the
[39:59] Syrian in a dream by night, and said
[40:02] unto him, Take heed that thou speak not
[40:04] to Jacob, either good or bad. Then Laban
[40:07] overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched
[40:10] his tent in the mount. And Laban with
[40:13] his brethren pitched in the mount of
[40:15] Gilead. And Laban said to Jacob, "What
[40:19] hast thou done that thou hast stolen
[40:21] away unawares uh to me and carried away
[40:25] my daughters as captives taken with the
[40:27] sword? Wherefore did thou flee away
[40:30] secretly, and steal away from me? And
[40:33] did not tell me that I might have sent
[40:35] thee away with mirth, and with song,
[40:37] with tabrate, and with harp?" Oh, yeah.
[40:41] and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons
[40:44] and my daughters. Thou hast thou hast
[40:47] done foolishly in so doing. It is in the
[40:51] power of my hand to do do you hurt. But
[40:54] the God of your father spake unto me
[40:56] yesterday night, saying, Take thou heed
[40:59] that thou speak not to Jacob either good
[41:01] or bad. And now, though thou wst needs
[41:05] be gone, because thou sore longest after
[41:09] thy father's house, yet wherefore hast
[41:12] thou stolen my gods? And Jacob, you see,
[41:16] uh Rachel had taken some idols of her
[41:19] father and hid them in their stuff. She
[41:22] stole them. She took them. Her maybe she
[41:25] didn't she just borrowed them. You know,
[41:27] when a daughter takes some of the
[41:28] father's stuff,
[41:31] she doesn't she doesn't think it's too
[41:33] serious. I remember when Tom and Joanne
[41:36] got married, I went up after a few weeks
[41:38] up to Joannne's room and there was
[41:39] nothing left in the room. The bedroom
[41:40] suite was gone. Everything was gone. I
[41:43] went and asked her, I said, "There's no
[41:45] furniture up in your room." She said,
[41:46] "That's my furniture."
[41:49] So, that's the way maybe Rachel thought
[41:51] about it.
[41:55] And uh and it says and the 32nd verse uh
[42:00] 31st verse and Jacob answered and said
[42:02] to Laban because I was afraid
[42:05] uh afraid for I said pre-adventure that
[42:07] thou wouldest take by force thy
[42:09] daughters from me. With whomsoever thou
[42:12] findest thy gods, let him not live
[42:16] before our brethren discern thou what is
[42:19] thine with me and take it to thee. For
[42:23] Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen
[42:26] them. And Laban went into Jacob's tent,
[42:30] and into Leah's tent, and into the two
[42:33] maidservants tents, and he found them
[42:36] not. Then went he out of out of Leah's
[42:39] tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
[42:41] Now Rachel had taken the images, and put
[42:43] them in the camel&lt;unk&gt;s furniture, and
[42:46] sat upon them. And Laban searched all
[42:48] the tent, but found them not. And she
[42:51] said to her father, "Let it not
[42:53] displease my lord that I cannot rise up
[42:56] before thee, for the custom of women is
[42:59] upon me." And he searched, but found not
[43:02] the images. And Jacob was wroth and cho
[43:06] with Laban. The the words in the Hebrews
[43:10] said he was absolutely angry. He was
[43:12] just filled with he was filled with
[43:15] fury.
[43:17] you came here and accused me and you
[43:19] can't find them. They're not here. I
[43:21] didn't steal anything. And Laban said
[43:25] with Laban and Jacob answered and said
[43:27] to Laban, "What is my trespass? What is
[43:30] my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued
[43:33] after me? Whereas thou hast searched all
[43:36] my stuff? What hast thou found of all
[43:38] thy household stuff? Set it here before
[43:41] my brethren and thy brethren, that they
[43:43] may judge betw twix us both." This 20
[43:46] years have I been with thee. Thy you use
[43:50] and thy goats have not cast their young
[43:53] and have not cast their young. And the
[43:55] rams of thy flock have I not eaten. That
[43:59] which was torn of beasts I brought not
[44:02] unto thee. I bear the loss of it. Of my
[44:05] hand did thou require it, whether stolen
[44:08] by day or stolen by night. Thus I was in
[44:12] the day the drought consumed me and the
[44:15] frost by night, and my sleep departed
[44:18] from mine eyes. Thus have I been 20
[44:21] years in thy house. I served thee 14
[44:24] years for thy two daughters, and six
[44:26] years for thy cattle, and thou hast
[44:28] changed my wages 10 times, except the
[44:32] God of heaven, except the God of my
[44:34] father, the God of Abraham, and the fear
[44:37] of Isaac had been with me. Surely thou
[44:40] hast sent me away now empty. God hath
[44:43] seen mine affliction and the labor of my
[44:46] hands, and rebuked thee yesterday night.
[44:49] And Laban answered and said unto Jacob,
[44:52] These daughters are my daughters, and
[44:54] these children are my children, and
[44:56] these cattle are my cattle, and all that
[44:58] thou seeest is mine, and what can I do
[45:02] this day unto thee unto these my
[45:04] daughters, or unto their children which
[45:07] they have borne? Now therefore, come
[45:09] thou, let us make a covenant, I and
[45:12] thou, and let it be for a witness
[45:14] between me and thee. And Jacob took a
[45:17] stone, and set it up for a pillar. And
[45:21] Jacob said unto his brethren, "Gather
[45:23] stones, and they took stones, and made a
[45:27] heap, and they did eat there upon the
[45:29] heap." And Laban called it Yagar
[45:33] Sahadutha.
[45:35] But Jacob called it Galed. And Laban
[45:39] said, "This heap is a witness between me
[45:41] and thee this day. Therefore was the
[45:44] name of it called Galed." And Mispa
[45:48] said, "For he said, the Lord watched
[45:51] between me and thee when we are absent
[45:54] from one another."
[45:57] All right, I'll just have you have your
[45:59] seats. We've read a lot of scripture
[46:03] and I'm sure you didn't get buried in
[46:05] it. Interesting account. I want to speak
[46:09] to you
[46:11] tonight.
[46:13] Uh, Wednesday's nice family night. I
[46:16] want to speak to you on how
[46:19] people
[46:20] can experience the same event
[46:25] and experience many many events because
[46:27] Jacob and Laban had much of their life
[46:31] 20 years of their life in common. In
[46:34] other words, they experienced a
[46:35] multitude of the same things.
[46:38] But Laban
[46:41] sees it one way and Jacob sees it quite
[46:45] another.
[46:46] Uh
[46:48] I was I've been thinking about this for
[46:49] a number of weeks. In fact is I've had
[46:51] this scripture in my message notes for
[46:54] probably the last five weeks and never
[46:57] have been able to come to it. So I said
[46:59] tonight although we leave for services
[47:03] in Ohio to do the dedication for brother
[47:05] Jeff's church uh leave tomorrow uh and
[47:09] this Sunday will be the dedication
[47:10] meetings. I felt I wanted to speak this
[47:13] here this evening and it and to me it's
[47:15] very very important um how we see
[47:18] things. Brother Brandham talks about the
[47:20] eyes of faith and I was thinking of the
[47:23] eyes of the word. The word has eyes.
[47:26] Brother Brandham talked about talked
[47:28] about Jesus coming down to see John and
[47:33] he and he puts it this way. How the eyes
[47:36] of the word looked into the eyes of the
[47:39] prophet. I thought that was so
[47:42] picturesque, so powerful. How the eyes
[47:45] of the word looked into the eyes of the
[47:47] prophet. And the word has eyesight.
[47:52] I wish that we as a church could operate
[47:55] and function our lives more with the
[47:58] eyesight of the word than we do with our
[48:01] natural eyesight. This word, the promise
[48:04] of this day has eyesight and we really
[48:07] need desperately that vision.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; We need to be able to see that by uh by
[48:14] the eyesight of the word. Now
[48:18] in uh in the sermon I'm just laying a
[48:20] little bit of a foundation in the sermon
[48:22] why I am a holy roller brother Brandham
[48:25] said
[48:28] he said oh my I'll tell you why I'm a
[48:30] holy roller he said I see the sign
[48:34] coming up
[48:36] look at him uh there when they were
[48:40] going the church moving on and then he
[48:43] refers to Joel now listen closely
[48:46] He said, "Joel saw God put a binocular
[48:50] on his eyes one day and he looked down
[48:53] through the stream of time yonder and he
[48:57] seen the church.
[48:59] He seen this vine torn
[49:03] down and destroyed."
[49:06] He said, "What the palmer left, the
[49:08] caterpillar's eaten. And what the
[49:11] caterpillar left, the locust has eaten.
[49:14] And what the locust eat, he left it for
[49:16] another another worm has eaten. He said,
[49:18] "Could this church ever grow again?"
[49:22] But God said, "I will restore, sayeth
[49:25] the Lord." And that's where Joel got his
[49:27] vision. He saw by what God was speaking
[49:31] to him. "I will restore, says the Lord."
[49:33] And he said Joel that prophet looking
[49:36] down through the eyes of faith because
[49:39] he had faith in what God was saying to
[49:42] him and what God was witnessing to him
[49:44] inside. And that gave him the vision. It
[49:47] wasn't what his eyes saw,
[49:49] &gt;&gt; but it's what what he had from an inner
[49:52] vision from what God was speaking to
[49:55] him. You know, we all have those eyes.
[49:57] You have that eyesight. You have that.
[49:59] It's not just you have access to it. You
[50:02] have that eyesight. But so often we're
[50:04] being dictated to by what we feel or
[50:07] what we see or the circumstances we're
[50:09] experiencing when in fact if you just
[50:12] turn your focus and your attention
[50:14] inside there'll be a witness in your
[50:17] soul and that is the witness that needs
[50:19] to give you the eyesight.
[50:21] Amen.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; And he said, looking down through the
[50:24] eyes of faith, he saw this vine coming
[50:28] out of Genesis,
[50:30] he saw when the Holy Ghost had fell. He
[50:34] saw the dark ages coming. He seen the
[50:37] vine destroyed and pushed down to a
[50:40] stump. H but God said, "I will restore,
[50:44] sayeth the Lord." Oh my. He said, "If it
[50:47] wasn't for that," Hallelujah. And if it
[50:49] wasn't for the promise we have today in
[50:52] this message, friends, we might as well
[50:54] shut the doors, go home, eat, drink, and
[50:56] be married. But the word has eyesight
[50:59] and if we just allow the the promise of
[51:02] this hour to come, God didn't just say,
[51:05] "I will restore," said the Lord. But he
[51:07] also said in Malachi, "Behold, I'll send
[51:10] you Elijah the prophet for a purpose,
[51:12] for a reason, to restore the children
[51:16] back to the faith of the fathers.
[51:19] That's my eyesight. That's the vision
[51:23] that we must have. And then he goes on.
[51:26] He said, "If it wasn't for that," he
[51:28] said, "you might be able to kill the
[51:30] branches." If it wasn't for the fact
[51:32] that God had spoke that, you might be
[51:34] able to kill the branches, but the life
[51:36] is in the church. I'd like you to say,
[51:39] "Amen." If you believe that he said,
[51:41] "Which is Jesus Christ?" And I read, I
[51:44] was reading this sentence. I was just
[51:47] reading it and rehearsing it in my in
[51:49] the study and I was reading these words,
[51:52] Jesus Christ, the lamb. And as I read
[51:55] the lamb, you people were out here
[51:58] singing that those very two words in a
[52:02] chorus and we said it together. I
[52:05] thought that was amazing. I was reading
[52:07] this quote and I was just saying the
[52:09] lamb. When you were saying the lamb in a
[52:12] song, I thought, "My God, you have a you
[52:15] have a uh you have a mind. You have a
[52:17] thought. You're getting the people right
[52:19] in the same spirit." And they said,
[52:21] "Jesus Christ, the lamb slain from the
[52:24] foundation of the word earth. He will
[52:26] get somebody who's going to believe
[52:29] him." As a this to me is a prophet
[52:32] speaking. He will get somebody. And I
[52:35] say today, I am that somebody. You must
[52:38] say you are that somebody. He has found
[52:42] somebody to believe his word. And this
[52:45] word has a it it gives me a a I have
[52:48] eyesight by the word. I have eyesight of
[52:52] the promise. The word still has eyes to
[52:55] see. Hallelujah.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said
[52:59] &gt;&gt; praise God.
[53:02] And then the message of trial,
[53:07] I'll just read. He said, "Don't look at
[53:08] me."
[53:10] He said, "You can look at me, but look,
[53:14] let your faith look beyond that." I'd
[53:18] like to say that tonight in this
[53:20] Wednesday evening service, you can see
[53:22] me as a pastor, as a speaker, as a
[53:26] minister tonight. But you must look
[53:27] beyond that or you're not going to get
[53:29] what God has in this service. You must
[53:32] look beyond that. He said, "You can see
[53:34] me, but look, let your faith look beyond
[53:37] that. You can look to me with physical
[53:40] eyes, but look to him with your eyes of
[53:43] faith." That he is that word. And he's
[53:48] just changed his mask. That's all he was
[53:50] saying. He's just changed his mask. It's
[53:52] the same one, same one that Joel saw. He
[53:56] said that Paul, he referred to Paul. He
[53:58] said he looked also. He looked through
[54:01] spiritual eyes and he saw the age that
[54:03] we're in. He said in the in those days
[54:06] there'll be treacherous days. Perilous
[54:08] times shall come. He saw them. Men will
[54:11] be lovers of their own selves more than
[54:14] lovers of God. Lovers of pleasure and
[54:16] they'll be heady and high-minded. He saw
[54:19] that. And here we have it today.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; We can see what's around us. And you
[54:25] know, you don't only see the conditions
[54:27] around, but you can you can sense the
[54:29] spirit of the age.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; And what the word has said about the day
[54:33] that we're living in is absolutely
[54:36] absolutely accurate.
[54:41] Now
[54:44] how how people can ex experience or look
[54:47] at the same same event
[54:51] and see it from different positions. How
[54:53] they can experience and go through two
[54:56] people can go through exactly the same.
[55:00] They can experience the same happening.
[55:03] It'll do one thing for one person and do
[55:06] completely the other thing for another
[55:08] person. One person will see it and it is
[55:10] a complete negative. This is terrible.
[55:13] This is disastrous. And next person sees
[55:16] it says what an opportunity.
[55:20] There was a fellow by the name of Robert
[55:22] McLaclin.
[55:24] How many here know about Robert
[55:26] McLaclin? Not very many.
[55:30] There's a fellow by the name of Robert
[55:32] McLaclin and he had his roots
[55:37] in Tyrone County actually Ireland but by
[55:40] the mid 1800s
[55:44] he had been lured to Peterborough
[55:47] Ontario
[55:49] with the promise of free farmland
[55:52] and to clear his farm Mlaclin built
[55:55] handles for axes
[55:58] and to supplement his income. He sold
[56:00] some handles at the local market.
[56:03] The handles went over well with the
[56:05] neighbors, and in 1867 or so, McLaclin
[56:10] built himself a horse carriage.
[56:13] So good was his design and craftsmanship
[56:16] that the neighbors who liked his axe
[56:18] handles asked him to build carriages for
[56:20] them.
[56:22] As knowledge of quality of MLAN's
[56:25] carriage spread, the more he was called
[56:27] upon to build and by 1867
[56:31] to 1901, McLaclin had moved from Tyrone
[56:34] to Ashawa, Ontario and expanded his
[56:38] operation so much that he had to give
[56:40] give it a name. Uh by 1901 the McGlaclin
[56:44] Carriage Company was born and the
[56:47] company was owned by McLaclin and his
[56:50] two sons
[56:52] Sam and George were his partners. 1901
[56:55] would prove to be a crucial turning
[56:58] point for Sam McLaclin when he and his
[57:01] brother were given a drive in a
[57:04] carriage. Uh uh the the the carriage
[57:07] company's bookkeepers new automobile.
[57:10] They just made an automobile. And Sam
[57:12] was enthusiastic over the technology,
[57:15] the son, and he wanted to get his father
[57:18] to invest in the production of these
[57:20] horseless carriages. And Robert, the
[57:24] father, he was not so forwardinking as
[57:26] his sons, saying that these contraptions
[57:30] were noisy, smelly, dangerous, and were
[57:33] a passing fad.
[57:36] I guess you know that Bill Gates said
[57:38] that the computer would be completely
[57:39] useless for the average home and it
[57:42] would be of no use whatsoever and it
[57:44] wouldn't need any more memory than about
[57:46] 640K or something like that.
[57:50] Bill Gates.
[57:53] Sam was not discouraged by his father
[57:56] and by 1907 he he testdriven a number of
[58:01] these passing fads and decided that he
[58:04] wanted to build the Buick in Canada.
[58:07] And Robert reluctantly his father
[58:09] agreed.
[58:11] So they approached another friend and
[58:13] I'll just abbreviate this and they
[58:16] established the Buick Motor Company.
[58:19] And then they were finally bought out by
[58:22] or became General Motors of Canada. That
[58:26] is how it began. It began with axe
[58:28] handles and ended up as General Motors
[58:31] of Canada.
[58:33] It was it it became the MLAN Motorc Car
[58:36] Company. I've actually seen a MLAN car,
[58:38] but I'm not from the 1800s.
[58:43] McGlaughlin built 154 cars in his first
[58:46] year of production and they were all
[58:49] sold all sold very quickly.
[58:52] However, sales dropped off etc.
[58:55] And then uh uh one day they uh the
[58:59] General Motors who had was in the states
[59:02] decided that they would uh merge.
[59:07] And so the McGlaughlin Motor Car Company
[59:10] grew and prospered until it had grown so
[59:13] complex that in 1918 it was bought by
[59:17] General Motors and renamed General
[59:19] Motors of Canada under the direction of
[59:22] the Sam McLaclin and Sam remained as
[59:25] president until 1945.
[59:28] He lived to be 101 years old. He was
[59:32] living when I was yet in Toronto.
[59:35] He didn't forget the country that made
[59:39] him so wealthy. And they have the MLAN
[59:42] planetarium in Toronto. They have the
[59:44] intensive care unit of the hospital for
[59:47] six children. The GE University library
[59:51] and uh part of the group of seven
[59:53] collection of uh vast collection of art
[59:56] and all of this he has given and donated
[59:58] and given back. But in 1929,
[1:00:03] the whole world crashed. The economy of
[1:00:06] the world crashed and the world went
[1:00:09] into a great depression. That's why I
[1:00:11] gave you this background.
[1:00:14] And people were lined up in for soup on
[1:00:17] the streets.
[1:00:18] My wife's dad
[1:00:22] tried to buy hay. And I met the man. He
[1:00:24] told me that he was standing in in my
[1:00:26] father-in-law's store and he told me Wes
[1:00:30] Harper needed hay for his animals for
[1:00:33] his cattle and I was selling hay for 50
[1:00:37] cents for an entire hay rack load and he
[1:00:41] couldn't afford it. He didn't have 50
[1:00:43] cents. There was no money. People slew
[1:00:46] and killed their cows by the thousands
[1:00:49] because a cow wasn't even worth a
[1:00:51] dollar. Nobody wanted them and there was
[1:00:54] no money and the country went into a a
[1:00:57] tremendous and it crashed overnight. The
[1:00:59] stock market totally collapsed.
[1:01:02] While people and there were a good
[1:01:04] number of them that leaped out of the
[1:01:07] skyscrapers in New York and committed
[1:01:10] suicide. Now I just want you to get this
[1:01:12] picture now so I can go on in my
[1:01:13] message. Just imagine the mental torture
[1:01:17] and torment that went through men's
[1:01:20] minds when to stand there and look down
[1:01:22] on those streets and say, "This has been
[1:01:24] such a catastrophe.
[1:01:27] I'll just end my life." And they leapt
[1:01:29] out of those buildings to their death.
[1:01:32] Sam McLaclin,
[1:01:34] he saw the same event completely
[1:01:36] opposite. He thought, "What an
[1:01:39] opportunity.
[1:01:40] The market has crashed." and he took all
[1:01:43] his resources or as much I guess as he
[1:01:46] had and bought General Motor stock
[1:01:49] because he had absolute confidence. This
[1:01:51] is a good company. This thing's going to
[1:01:54] come back and I'm going to buy all the
[1:01:56] stock that I can get my hands on. And he
[1:01:58] became the largest shareholder of
[1:02:00] General Motors
[1:02:03] by taking an opportunity in a crash when
[1:02:07] people were committing suicide.
[1:02:10] the same event looked at from two
[1:02:14] totally different perspectives.
[1:02:16] And I I I I would sooner have MLANS
[1:02:22] than be down there a piece of uh you
[1:02:24] know a grease spot on a street someplace
[1:02:28] and he went from axe handles and that's
[1:02:30] why he had confidence. He didn't get it
[1:02:32] on a golden platter. He worked hard. He
[1:02:35] made axe handles and sold axe handles.
[1:02:37] Then he got some carriages and he went
[1:02:39] on from there. went on from there and
[1:02:41] then when this terrible calamity came
[1:02:44] not only in this country in America,
[1:02:46] North America but all over the world he
[1:02:48] saw it as a great opportunity
[1:03:00] the scripture which we read.
[1:03:04] I'm going to give you just a little
[1:03:06] background because I'm going to come
[1:03:07] directly to my point.
[1:03:12] I read and I've been studying this for a
[1:03:14] number of weeks now where Isaac
[1:03:16] instructed
[1:03:18] Jacob his son. He said, "You go to your
[1:03:23] kindred and choose a wife." This whole
[1:03:26] episode, all of this 20 years started by
[1:03:30] a young man heeding his father's
[1:03:33] instruction. He said, "Don't take a wife
[1:03:36] of the of the people here. you go to
[1:03:38] your kindred and go to your uh your
[1:03:42] mother's brother and there choose a wife
[1:03:46] of his daughters and I gave you the
[1:03:48] background how he served and then Jacob
[1:03:52] leaving him and this great uh clash of
[1:03:56] their their natures you know also
[1:04:01] Rachel now obviously Jacob discovered at
[1:04:05] some point that Rachel
[1:04:07] caused all of this. But you don't find
[1:04:10] him reprimanding her or becoming uh
[1:04:14] angry with her or whatever more. He he
[1:04:17] saw that God's hand was in it all. He
[1:04:21] saw he saw the hand of God in the whole
[1:04:23] thing. And uh and and now I want to draw
[1:04:27] your attention
[1:04:29] to this uh particular
[1:04:32] verse of scripture.
[1:04:34] And it says here that
[1:04:38] that Laban when they took a heap of
[1:04:42] stones and they made their
[1:04:45] covenant, not so much a covenant, but
[1:04:48] they ate and they uh it would be a
[1:04:51] witness. And Laban, he called it Jagger
[1:04:56] Sahadutha,
[1:04:58] and that means a heap, a gathering of a
[1:05:01] heap.
[1:05:03] And Jacob, he called it Galed,
[1:05:08] which is actually the same as Gilead.
[1:05:11] They both have the same the same
[1:05:13] meaning. But now
[1:05:16] Jacob didn't want to call it
[1:05:18] what Laban had called it because what
[1:05:21] Laban called it, it was just a a heap of
[1:05:24] stones. That's all it was to him. But to
[1:05:28] Jacob, it had a completely different
[1:05:30] meaning. the same event had a completely
[1:05:33] different meaning. And I want to go into
[1:05:36] this with with some depth because
[1:05:40] uh for Jacob
[1:05:42] it if you if you will remember uh Joshua
[1:05:47] when he first came into the country and
[1:05:50] Mount Gilead is an important you'll find
[1:05:53] it all sprinkled all through the
[1:05:55] scripture because Mount Gilead was a a
[1:05:59] place that number one it makes reference
[1:06:02] to a witness witness. This is a witness.
[1:06:06] And to Jacob, the witness was that it
[1:06:10] was a covenant. And that covenant must
[1:06:14] remain faithful. And in the Hebrew, it
[1:06:17] is, as I've used the meaning of it here
[1:06:19] before, to say the same thing. You
[1:06:23] remember me saying that, and to say it
[1:06:25] again and again. And every time you say
[1:06:28] it, you say it exactly the same. If you
[1:06:31] don't say it the same, then it's not a
[1:06:33] covenant. That is why if you can just
[1:06:35] grasp what I'm saying, that is why
[1:06:38] you'll find brother Brandham or any
[1:06:40] prophet of God coming back when he's
[1:06:43] saying thus sayeth the Lord, the thing
[1:06:46] that he condemns so much was
[1:06:49] denominations because he said there
[1:06:51] isn't one that can take the whole word.
[1:06:55] So what he's really saying is to to put
[1:06:57] it in another language
[1:06:59] if if they can't take the whole word
[1:07:02] that means at some point they have to
[1:07:05] say something else
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; and that is condemned by almighty God
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; because then the covenant is no longer a
[1:07:14] covenant. And so to Jacob, notice what
[1:07:18] he said now to Laban when he he this
[1:07:21] whole occurrence allowed him to have
[1:07:24] this explosive moment of wroth and he
[1:07:28] was angry with Laban. You pursued me
[1:07:31] like a thief. I worked for you for 20
[1:07:33] years, seven years for this daughter,
[1:07:36] seven years for that daughter, six years
[1:07:38] for the cattle. I took the ring
[1:07:39] straight. I took all the speckled. I
[1:07:42] took the bad ones. If something was
[1:07:43] wounded, I didn't even I didn't even
[1:07:45] charge you for it. I took the wounded. I
[1:07:47] took the loss. I took all that. Now you
[1:07:49] follow me like a thief. Like I've stolen
[1:07:52] your gods or something. You see, God
[1:07:55] actually allowed that. Don't ask me to
[1:07:57] explain it all. But whatever uh whatever
[1:08:00] possessed Rachel to take those idols,
[1:08:04] you can only conclude because you have
[1:08:06] to see Jesus Christ in every verse. You
[1:08:09] can only conclude that God allowed her
[1:08:11] to do that to give Jacob this
[1:08:14] opportunity so that this could be
[1:08:16] written and he could actually
[1:08:17] demonstrate what really was in his
[1:08:19] heart. And after he choed with Laban and
[1:08:22] he scolded him out and all the rest of
[1:08:24] it and he told him, "You changed my
[1:08:27] wages 10 times." And he said it twice.
[1:08:31] "You changed." In other words, your
[1:08:33] covenant is no good. Your word is no
[1:08:36] good. You are not reliable. You've
[1:08:39] changed your You've changed your word.
[1:08:41] You changed your promise. You are an
[1:08:43] unreliable person. And I'm out of here.
[1:08:46] I'm done with you. I thank God he
[1:08:49] separated from him. And so when he made
[1:08:51] the heap, it didn't only mean a heap of
[1:08:54] stones, but it also had direct reference
[1:08:57] to a a second compounding word, which is
[1:09:00] that this is a covenant. For me, it's a
[1:09:02] covenant. And it and it is a covenant
[1:09:05] that can be repeated again and again and
[1:09:08] again. There's something wonderful about
[1:09:09] a person's life when you see them 10
[1:09:11] years ago and you see them 5 years ago,
[1:09:14] you see him today and you see a track
[1:09:16] record and you know in your heart that
[1:09:19] person's going to be the same if God
[1:09:20] gives them life is going to be the same
[1:09:22] for the next 20 years, next 25 years.
[1:09:25] Nothing's going to change them. Styles
[1:09:27] aren't going to change them. Poverty
[1:09:28] won't change them. Money won't change
[1:09:30] them. Death won't change them. Nothing
[1:09:32] will change them. Give them something or
[1:09:35] take it away, they will be the same
[1:09:37] because they are tied to God's covenant.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; And that's what it meant for Jacob.
[1:09:43] That's why I call it Gilead Galed
[1:09:47] because in fact is you can even see what
[1:09:49] is in him because when he left and he
[1:09:51] began to flee, he fled towards that
[1:09:54] mountain and the word means heap of
[1:09:57] stones. Even Mount Gilead means heap of
[1:10:00] stones. And that's where he's headed to
[1:10:02] because to him it was a it's a covenant
[1:10:05] place. When Joshua brought the children
[1:10:07] of Israel into the promised land, that's
[1:10:10] the first place they went to was there
[1:10:14] because it was a sign. And God said to
[1:10:16] him, I have this will be a sign.
[1:10:19] Something like that because I have the
[1:10:20] scripture. I'll give you a little later
[1:10:22] because he says I have this will be a
[1:10:24] sign. I have I have removed the bondage.
[1:10:30] I have rolled off. And the word is
[1:10:32] rolled. I have rolled off the bondage of
[1:10:37] Egypt. And this is a sign. He's telling
[1:10:41] them, you're done with this bondage.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; And this is exactly what Jacob was
[1:10:45] saying. Jacob was saying, "I'm done with
[1:10:49] this weight and this heaviness, this
[1:10:52] servitude to this man. This heap means
[1:10:55] to me, I'm going to serve God that's
[1:10:58] reliable. I'm going to serve God who
[1:11:00] keeps his word and I'm done with you.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; I'm done with this bondage."
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; And that's what it meant to him.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; This bondage is rolled off from me.
[1:11:16] Oh my.
[1:11:18] Tell you what,
[1:11:21] I went through these scriptures.
[1:11:23] I I went through the scriptures real
[1:11:26] close. Says, "And he and he took his
[1:11:28] brethren with him and pursued after him
[1:11:30] seven days journey. And they overtook
[1:11:32] him in Mount Gilead." That's where they
[1:11:35] overtook Laban. I mean, Laban overtook
[1:11:39] uh Jacob because that's where that's
[1:11:41] where he that's where he had stopped.
[1:11:45] And then
[1:11:47] Laban saying to Jacob,
[1:11:49] "Thou hast stolen away unawares of me."
[1:11:53] Now notice how he says it. "And you've
[1:11:54] carried away my daughters
[1:11:57] as captives taken with the sword." And
[1:12:00] he delivers a strong accusation
[1:12:03] against him. And he told him, you know,
[1:12:06] uh just when we were reading it, I hope
[1:12:07] you noticed it. He says, "You've taken
[1:12:09] my daughters and you've taken my sons
[1:12:12] and you've taken my cattle." And he
[1:12:13] said, "Furthermore, all this is mine."
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Showing that he w was supremely
[1:12:20] not simply unreliable, but he was not
[1:12:24] trustful. He was not a godly man in that
[1:12:28] sense of the word because he made his
[1:12:30] word, made his promise, broke it, made
[1:12:32] his promise, broke it. And Jacob, this I
[1:12:36] this was very, very significant. And so
[1:12:39] for Laban, here's one way of looking at
[1:12:42] it and it's going to come home to us
[1:12:45] right where we're living. But he
[1:12:49] to him, well, I've met and and here
[1:12:53] here's the whole sum and substance of
[1:12:54] we've had a pile of stones here and and
[1:12:56] we've had a meal over top of that's all
[1:12:59] it was to him. That's how he saw it.
[1:13:03] Jacob says that's not it at all. This
[1:13:06] pile of stones is a witness. And the
[1:13:09] witness has to be a true covenant. And a
[1:13:11] true covenant has to be the same every
[1:13:13] time. Every time. Every time. It can't
[1:13:16] change. That his faith was in God. And
[1:13:19] furthermore, this is evidence because it
[1:13:21] come from another word, rolling off or
[1:13:24] roll away. And and and and this is a
[1:13:27] sign. This heap of stones here. It might
[1:13:30] just be a pile of stones to you, Laban,
[1:13:32] but to me, the oppression and servitude
[1:13:36] of all of these 20 years is gone. I'm
[1:13:39] free from you. I'm free from this burden
[1:13:42] anymore. How many can remember when you
[1:13:44] got came free from it?
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; You don't you don't remember the bondage
[1:13:49] of Egypt anymore. You're done with it
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; because God's promise is true.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if you have a doubt in
[1:13:58] it, if you question it, then of course
[1:14:00] then you're going to you're going to
[1:14:02] slip into a bondage or a condemnation.
[1:14:05] And he goes on and tells him, I've got
[1:14:07] power to do you hurt.
[1:14:11] He didn't have any power at all.
[1:14:14] God met him. Can you imagine God?
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; What would you feel about that? You're
[1:14:19] pursuing somebody and the very God of
[1:14:22] that person comes to you and says, "You
[1:14:23] don't say anything either good or bad.
[1:14:28] that I think that would kind of stall me
[1:14:30] in my tracks,
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; but didn't seem to phase him too much.
[1:14:36] And when and when Jacob finally was
[1:14:39] dealing with him, the scripture, the
[1:14:41] words for the scripture, you have to
[1:14:43] understand, he was furious.
[1:14:46] He he it was to burn with anger and to
[1:14:50] be incense. This wasn't just a little
[1:14:52] bit of a a tiff. I tell you what, he he
[1:14:56] had his moment to to tell Laban what had
[1:15:00] been burning on him for a long time.
[1:15:05] Now,
[1:15:08] Jacob giving it the name of the place
[1:15:11] that of what he was experiencing.
[1:15:17] I got thinking
[1:15:20] of how
[1:15:23] we see things.
[1:15:26] I thought of Samson
[1:15:29] and how the people around him saw him
[1:15:33] and they were rejoicing
[1:15:36] that they had this champion
[1:15:40] as a prisoner with no eyes. And he was a
[1:15:44] sorry sight. And brother Brandham
[1:15:46] describes it. He was a sorry, sorry
[1:15:49] sight. It was a pitiful sight.
[1:15:53] But he says this one more time.
[1:15:56] One more time. Once more, Lord. And even
[1:16:00] gave a message title for the prophet of
[1:16:04] God in this day. So many times he
[1:16:06] preached once more.
[1:16:09] And Samson saw a possibility. You know,
[1:16:13] we're living in an awful dark time.
[1:16:15] We're living in a time when the church
[1:16:17] has gone blind. We're living in a time,
[1:16:20] as I was saying, Sunday, there are
[1:16:22] momentous things that are happening. And
[1:16:25] if we looked at just what the world sees
[1:16:29] or what we see, if we just looked at
[1:16:31] that, it could be you could be very,
[1:16:33] very disheartened at what you see. And
[1:16:36] I'm sure that twinges on you all the
[1:16:38] time. It does me almost every day. I see
[1:16:42] things and it's so disheartening. You
[1:16:45] see things that are inequitable. You see
[1:16:49] such injustice.
[1:16:51] It's just monstrous injustices that are
[1:16:53] happening. And you see people under the
[1:16:56] weight of it. You see the world trying
[1:16:58] to live their life. You see the whole
[1:17:00] way things are going. And whether you
[1:17:03] look at whether it be the government or
[1:17:05] the business or the or the education
[1:17:07] system or you see the young people, I I
[1:17:10] see I don't like to be negative, but I
[1:17:12] see some of the young people. I feel so
[1:17:15] sorry for them. And my wife was just uh
[1:17:18] talking about, you know, there's some
[1:17:20] little boys, little boys, young fellas,
[1:17:25] two of them 13 and one 11.
[1:17:28] And they brutalized a woman
[1:17:32] and and I don't know what all they were
[1:17:34] trying to get her purse or what they
[1:17:35] were trying to do. And the police
[1:17:37] actually caught them right I guess right
[1:17:41] in the act right over here in Burnaby.
[1:17:44] and they've been having quite a bit of
[1:17:46] this. Some of them were 13 and 14 and
[1:17:48] 15. And the police took the 11 year old
[1:17:51] and it was around midnight at night and
[1:17:54] went to the home of the parents, got
[1:17:56] them out of bed and says, "This what
[1:17:59] your boys in?" They said, "They can't
[1:18:02] believe it. My boy, my little boy 11
[1:18:05] years old."
[1:18:07] You know, you say, "Is this a world I'm
[1:18:10] living in where parents don't even know
[1:18:13] where 11year-old child is and they're in
[1:18:16] bed and they have what's going on? What
[1:18:18] kind of a world are we living in?" And
[1:18:20] if we just looked at that, you could
[1:18:22] beame, you could become very very That's
[1:18:24] the way some people have to look at it.
[1:18:26] But I have to look at something else. I
[1:18:28] have to look at I have to look at the
[1:18:30] covenant and say, "This is the way it's
[1:18:32] going to be. You might as well get used
[1:18:35] to it. This is the way it's going to
[1:18:36] be." And this covenant says, and you
[1:18:38] might as well repeat it, it's not going
[1:18:40] to get any better. This covenant says
[1:18:42] things shall wax worse and worse. Does
[1:18:46] it not say that? And God is going to
[1:18:48] fold it up. This whole cosmos, he's
[1:18:51] going to fold it up like an old garment
[1:18:53] and put it away. But and this world is
[1:18:55] not even good enough for the believer to
[1:18:58] live in. God is going to burn it with a
[1:19:00] holy fire. And he's going to bring
[1:19:02] forth, he's going to bring forth a new
[1:19:04] heaven where there is no demons in it,
[1:19:06] where there is no television, where
[1:19:08] there is no radio in it. There's none of
[1:19:10] this filth in the heavens. He's going to
[1:19:12] burn the very elements. He's going to
[1:19:14] cleanse the earth. He's going to cleanse
[1:19:16] the earth with a renovation and make it
[1:19:18] over new and then say to his children,
[1:19:20] "Here it is."
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; That's also what he said here in the
[1:19:26] word. And we might as well say it again
[1:19:29] and say it again and repeat it again and
[1:19:31] say it like he said it because that's
[1:19:33] the way it's going to be.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; That's what Jacob was saying.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Many of you know right well they they
[1:19:42] don't have a covenant in this world.
[1:19:45] They don't know such a thing as a
[1:19:47] covenant. It's said one way and said
[1:19:50] another way and and truth breakers.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Truth breakers. It's just hard to have.
[1:19:59] And if we looked at that, you could be
[1:20:01] very very disheartened with it. But we
[1:20:03] have a we have a different eyesight. And
[1:20:06] we're seeing some different things.
[1:20:10] To Jacob, I mean to Laban, it was just a
[1:20:14] heap of stones. Listen to me, friends. I
[1:20:17] don't care whether it is your job or or
[1:20:20] something. What could be more
[1:20:22] elementary? What could be more just
[1:20:28] I don't even know what to call it. What
[1:20:29] what could be more simple than just a
[1:20:31] pile of stones?
[1:20:35] But uh
[1:20:37] to Jacob it was a whole lot more than a
[1:20:38] pile of stones.
[1:20:40] This is a special event. I'm here in
[1:20:43] Mount Gilead. I'm going to call it. I
[1:20:46] don't care what you call it. Laban, I'm
[1:20:48] calling it. And Laban to me could be
[1:20:51] anybody. Could be the world, could be
[1:20:52] your employer, could be anything. I
[1:20:54] don't care what you call it. You might
[1:20:56] just call this a job. You might just
[1:20:58] call me a servant. You might call me an
[1:21:00] employee. But I am a servant of God. I
[1:21:03] am under a covenant of the almighty God.
[1:21:05] That's what I'm here doing. You might
[1:21:07] just call it my salary, but I am here
[1:21:09] serving God. That's what I'm here for.
[1:21:12] I'm here in this world for a purpose.
[1:21:14] You might know me as just my own name.
[1:21:17] I'm just add to you, but not in the eyes
[1:21:19] of God. And I have a different eyesight.
[1:21:22] You got to have a different eyesight.
[1:21:24] You have to see yourself. You listen.
[1:21:26] Jesus Jesus had great respect to who he
[1:21:29] was. And he even taught the disciples.
[1:21:32] You know, they were they may have been
[1:21:33] passive, but I tell you what, they they
[1:21:35] weren't just uh they weren't just
[1:21:37] something to trample over.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; They stood for what was truth and they
[1:21:42] stood for what was right. And you have
[1:21:44] to have respect. You have to have
[1:21:46] respect to yourself as a believer
[1:21:50] and hold that. You hold it with a with
[1:21:53] an honor. You hold it with a dignity.
[1:21:58] Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Just another moment or two
[1:22:10] in the message proof of his
[1:22:12] resurrection.
[1:22:14] Brother Brown takes this
[1:22:17] little scene and so often he he draws a
[1:22:20] scene, a picture and people think you're
[1:22:22] just telling a nice little story. Oh,
[1:22:25] there's depth there that we don't want
[1:22:28] to miss.
[1:22:30] says in the days when they had slaves
[1:22:33] and they were in bondage
[1:22:36] and they were slaves, he says here in
[1:22:38] the states and Abraham Lincoln died to
[1:22:41] free the colored man to give him rights
[1:22:45] not to be a slave any longer.
[1:22:48] And they were going to be freed at
[1:22:50] sunrise, too. And he said they were so
[1:22:53] happy about it knowing that they were
[1:22:55] going to be free soon as the sun rose.
[1:22:58] Some of them that were healthier and
[1:23:00] better physically fit, they climbed up
[1:23:03] on a mountain.
[1:23:05] Some could go all the way to the top.
[1:23:08] He's m he's making a point.
[1:23:10] Some here might be able to go all the
[1:23:13] way to the top. I'm talking about this
[1:23:16] congregation.
[1:23:18] Some may not be able to make it to the
[1:23:20] top. And he said some way, some halfway
[1:23:23] and some all the way down.
[1:23:26] And as soon as the sun began to peep up,
[1:23:30] the great strong ones
[1:23:33] was up on top. And I'd liken today to
[1:23:37] great strong Christians who rise up into
[1:23:40] the sphere of the Holy Spirit and those
[1:23:43] who come along the road under
[1:23:46] justification and those are way down in
[1:23:49] the valley of confusion. But he says
[1:23:52] they raised up and as soon as the ones
[1:23:54] was high could see it first way off and
[1:23:58] when they seen the sun rising they
[1:24:00] screamed at the top of their voice
[1:24:03] strong ones were higher up they saw the
[1:24:06] sun just peeping they begin to see
[1:24:09] what's he talking about talking about
[1:24:11] people who can see something
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; down the way off in the horizon but they
[1:24:17] see it I'm not talking about vision from
[1:24:19] the eyes I'm taking from this account
[1:24:22] what we see spiritually. And maybe some
[1:24:25] here maybe haven't seen anything for a
[1:24:27] while. It doesn't mean that the sun is
[1:24:29] shining. Might be that you're just too
[1:24:31] far down in the shadows. Oh God, lift me
[1:24:34] up. Let me rise up. Let me walk up.
[1:24:37] Strengthen my body. Strengthen my
[1:24:39] spiritual legs. Give me stanma and
[1:24:42] stamina. And let me rise up and see what
[1:24:45] is shining. The light that is shining.
[1:24:49] I tell you sometimes I come to the
[1:24:52] pullpit
[1:24:56] and this last this last week I knew what
[1:24:59] I was going to preach and by a long time
[1:25:03] along about Friday
[1:25:07] I was I said you know it's just a
[1:25:10] roadblock just like a wall in front of
[1:25:13] me and I can't I can't move forward and
[1:25:17] God just shut the door and in the
[1:25:20] meantime I just began to get a a burden
[1:25:23] in my heart and you know the scripture
[1:25:25] says the burden of the word of the lord
[1:25:27] it starts that in Malachi the burden of
[1:25:29] the word of the lord the word of the
[1:25:31] lord actually has a burden brother
[1:25:33] Brandham in the message way of a true
[1:25:35] prophet he said came down the prophet
[1:25:37] Amos came down
[1:25:40] uh down the hill and coming down and he
[1:25:43] looked over Israel saw Israel all spread
[1:25:46] out before him he said had his little
[1:25:48] bald head uh beaded with prespiration
[1:25:51] and he come down and said his eyes
[1:25:53] narrowed as he looked on the condition
[1:25:55] of Israel. Israel was prospering. Israel
[1:25:58] was in a time like perhaps we are.
[1:26:01] Things are going great and and and and
[1:26:03] prosperity everywhere and Israel that
[1:26:05] this is a great this is a great uh
[1:26:08] society and civilization and we're
[1:26:10] having a great age that we're living in.
[1:26:12] That isn't what Amos saw. Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And Amos cried out against their sin and
[1:26:17] cried out against their iniquity because
[1:26:19] he had different eyesight.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; And my brother, my sister, we that have
[1:26:24] the message. We have a completely a
[1:26:26] different vision. Don't don't let your
[1:26:28] vision become affected or don't let it
[1:26:30] become clouded by what what I say Laban
[1:26:34] just call a heap of stones. To everyone
[1:26:36] out there, the job is the job. and and
[1:26:38] uh wages is the wages and to be able to
[1:26:41] buy and things and all of the substance
[1:26:43] that is around us and the work and the
[1:26:45] opportunities and everything else.
[1:26:47] You'll have exactly the same thing that
[1:26:50] Laban had. You'll have the same thing
[1:26:52] that others but don't look at it the
[1:26:54] same way.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; It's not just a job. It's not just a
[1:26:58] business. It's not just an education.
[1:27:01] It's not just all of these things.
[1:27:03] That's just the heap of stones. But you
[1:27:05] see beyond that. Hallelujah. God has
[1:27:07] given me eyesight. I see beyond that.
[1:27:10] It's not just the hardship.
[1:27:13] It's not just the false accusation.
[1:27:16] You had a falsely accused for something.
[1:27:19] It's not just a false act. You look
[1:27:20] beyond that. Hallelujah. Say, "Uh, I I
[1:27:25] I'm registering something here tonight.
[1:27:27] Even on this Wednesday night, God, give
[1:27:30] me a clear vision in an eyesight. I see
[1:27:33] too many believers in this church
[1:27:35] affected by adversity.
[1:27:38] When as a believer supposed to be
[1:27:40] affected by adversity? None at all. Who
[1:27:44] doesn't have adversity? We all have it.
[1:27:46] You're not to be affected by adversity.
[1:27:49] And you want to take an opportunity as
[1:27:51] it is in this night's service and say
[1:27:53] that which is being spoken is of the
[1:27:55] Holy Ghost. And I I am not going to
[1:27:58] consider this just as a heap of stones
[1:28:00] anymore. I'm considering this this
[1:28:02] evening. I'm considering this time. I'm
[1:28:05] making this my moment.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Labens are everywhere.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:18] And I can say
[1:28:21] and I'll say it to you in the name of
[1:28:22] the Lord. And it's nothing new to you,
[1:28:24] but I I want to confirm and I want to
[1:28:27] say it again. The sun's up.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; The sun is shining.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Rise and shine for your light has come.
[1:28:37] Not everybody's light, but your light
[1:28:38] has come and the glory of the Lord has
[1:28:41] come upon you and has shone upon you.
[1:28:44] And you can believe it or disregard it.
[1:28:46] But if you disregard it, it'll just be a
[1:28:48] heap of stones. That's all life is. It's
[1:28:50] just a heap of stones.
[1:28:53] Just a heap of stones.
[1:28:57] I say if if God gives you
[1:29:02] a room
[1:29:04] just to live in, serve God in it.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; If he gives you a car, an automobile,
[1:29:13] be always giving. Don't figure out how
[1:29:17] that betters you. Say, "How can I use
[1:29:18] this for the kingdom of God?" God gives
[1:29:21] you uh some status or some education or
[1:29:25] a vocation or something. Always be
[1:29:28] thinking about how I can Don't just
[1:29:31] consider it a vocation. That's just a
[1:29:34] heap of stones.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Don't just consider it a business. Don't
[1:29:37] consider your home just a home. That's
[1:29:40] just a heap of stones. How can we bless
[1:29:42] others? How can we be blessing to
[1:29:44] others? How can I pour my life out to
[1:29:46] others? Can you say amen?
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, friends, I
[1:29:49] believe that with everything that's in
[1:29:51] me.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; And your time is not your own time. The
[1:29:55] time is God's time. And just say, "I'm
[1:29:58] here as a servant. God's given me so
[1:30:00] much time. I don't know how much time.
[1:30:02] God's given me so much strength. I don't
[1:30:04] know how much. God's given me some days.
[1:30:06] I don't know how many." You say, "Well,
[1:30:08] oh, that's all right for you, Brother
[1:30:10] Ed. You're down there. You're preaching
[1:30:11] your your you know, you're you're
[1:30:13] preaching your lungs out and all the
[1:30:15] rest of it." I can tell you something
[1:30:17] friends that that that is the way that I
[1:30:20] believe. I believe it with all my heart.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Believe it with all my
[1:30:28] heart.
[1:30:31] I've told you before. I just tell you
[1:30:33] these little accounts because sometimes
[1:30:35] you forget and then others grow up. I
[1:30:38] was I was just a young man. I got I got
[1:30:40] a new car. I got a new car. It was uh uh
[1:30:44] I had a partnership with the bank
[1:30:47] and they owned the most of it, but I had
[1:30:49] control of it
[1:30:52] and we didn't have the streets you have
[1:30:54] out here. No, we were kind of in the
[1:30:57] backwoods
[1:30:59] and I I just had this car. It was red
[1:31:01] and white and old's mobile
[1:31:05] and uh I picked up kids for Sunday
[1:31:08] school to take to church. And there was
[1:31:10] one family,
[1:31:13] did they have kids? When you open the
[1:31:16] door, they just came out like, you know,
[1:31:18] rabbits.
[1:31:21] I don't know how many they had, but Oh,
[1:31:25] and uh how many know what gumbo is?
[1:31:28] Good. Northern gumbo. Mud, your
[1:31:30] bootstick in it.
[1:31:33] I've gone across the street more than
[1:31:34] once and left my boot there and was
[1:31:36] standing in my stocking feet in the next
[1:31:38] step. That's how it sucks your hangs
[1:31:40] onto your boots.
[1:31:42] Well, I I And this car had red carpets.
[1:31:47] I remember that. It was white and red
[1:31:49] color outside and had red carpets
[1:31:51] inside. Probably one of the nicest cars
[1:31:54] I could have ever had.
[1:31:57] I think it was I think my father-in-law
[1:31:58] thought it was a foolish investment. And
[1:32:00] looking back, I would agree with him.
[1:32:03] But we young people, we like new things.
[1:32:06] New, clean, you know. And here I pulled
[1:32:09] up to this house and I just kind of
[1:32:11] cringed
[1:32:13] because I had to run across this muddy
[1:32:15] yard and climb into my nice brand
[1:32:18] spanking new car with red carpets. And
[1:32:21] whoopee, here they come, you know, just
[1:32:23] piling out of this house. And I had to
[1:32:26] put the seat forward cuz it was just a
[1:32:28] two door. I'll never forget it. And they
[1:32:31] all had rubber boots on and they started
[1:32:33] piling into the back of this car and mud
[1:32:36] was going on the seat and mud was going
[1:32:38] everywhere and I just
[1:32:42] had to remember this car was dedicated
[1:32:44] to the Lord's work. You know it this
[1:32:47] might be an account for you but I I I'll
[1:32:50] lay it on you. Why don't you try it?
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Why don't you do it
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; now? Say amen.
[1:33:00] go out and down some road and get
[1:33:03] somebody and invite them to church and
[1:33:05] bring them in. Hey, we don't want to sit
[1:33:07] here and be comfortable.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; There's things to do.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; There's things to do. There's lots to
[1:33:14] do. And I'm so thankful for everybody
[1:33:16] that takes their part. This church
[1:33:20] and what happens here can just be a pile
[1:33:22] of stones.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Everybody goes to church. All kinds of
[1:33:26] people go to church. But this isn't just
[1:33:28] a church for me. If I thought this was
[1:33:31] just a church, you say, 'Well, you're
[1:33:32] the pastor. I tell you what, I'd check
[1:33:34] out of here just like that.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "Is that right?" Absolutely
[1:33:39] right. I've checked out of them before.
[1:33:42] If this was just a if this was just a
[1:33:43] heap of stones to me, but no. To me, I
[1:33:48] see Gilead.
[1:33:51] To me, it's a place where the covenant
[1:33:54] of God remains the same. meeting after
[1:33:58] meeting after service after service and
[1:34:00] the message of the hour remains the
[1:34:03] same. We're not going to dilute it.
[1:34:05] We're not going to change it. It's going
[1:34:06] to be the same. It's a covenant of God.
[1:34:09] That's what it means to me. More than a
[1:34:10] heap of stones. I don't care who
[1:34:12] preaches. Whether it be brother John or
[1:34:14] brother Lance, brother Tom, brother Da,
[1:34:16] whoever preaches, I come here with
[1:34:18] confidence that God's going to maybe I
[1:34:20] don't hear maybe 90% of it doesn't
[1:34:23] relate to me, but the 10 that does
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; or the one statement that does. Oh my, I
[1:34:30] tell you what, I whispered in Brother
[1:34:32] Lance's ear, he's not here, but I I
[1:34:34] whispered in his ear when I shook his
[1:34:36] hand last Sunday when he preached. I
[1:34:38] said, "The Holy Ghost made you say those
[1:34:41] things." That's what it was to me. The
[1:34:44] Holy Ghost. What was it to you?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; What was it to you? The Holy Ghost. I
[1:34:51] trust you can believe it's the Holy
[1:34:52] Ghost saying something to somebody. Even
[1:34:55] tonight on this night, we're not here to
[1:34:57] put in a Wednesday night. We're not here
[1:34:59] just to fill in a couple of hours. I
[1:35:01] prayed before I came in here. I said,
[1:35:02] "God, this is the hour of prayer. This
[1:35:05] is the hour we come here to hear from
[1:35:07] you. You speak to the people. Speak to
[1:35:10] me. take your word and speak to my own
[1:35:13] soul. That's what I'm here for. That's
[1:35:16] what my my whole life is is is devoted
[1:35:19] to that. And I I trust that yours is,
[1:35:21] too.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:26] God wants people who's climbed up the
[1:35:28] hill,
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; gone a little bit higher
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; until you become compelled and you you
[1:35:38] you can't hold your peace and it's
[1:35:42] something that you see. A lot of people
[1:35:44] climb the hill, don't see anything, but
[1:35:46] you climb the hill and you can cry out,
[1:35:49] "The sun is shining. Hallelujah. The sun
[1:35:52] is up." And what does that mean? You're
[1:35:54] free.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; This is Jubilee. You're free.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; This is Gilead. The bondage is rolled
[1:36:01] away. The formalism is rolled away.
[1:36:04] Everything that Satan would try to lay
[1:36:05] on the believer, it's rolled away. The
[1:36:08] reproach is rolled away. Our service to
[1:36:11] the world is rolled away. I don't just
[1:36:13] serve the world anymore in my job. This
[1:36:15] isn't a heap of stones. Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; You brothers that drive buses, you
[1:36:19] brothers that work in different places
[1:36:20] and sisters and all that you have your
[1:36:22] dayto-day duties. You raise a family.
[1:36:25] All kinds of people raise a family.
[1:36:27] Could be just a heap of stones. That's
[1:36:29] not a r. You're ser you're raising them
[1:36:32] to serve God. You're praying for them.
[1:36:34] You're believing for them. And whatever
[1:36:36] state they're in tonight, you're
[1:36:37] believing for them because that's what a
[1:36:40] mother and father does. Believe for
[1:36:42] them.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They don't always go the way
[1:36:45] we want them to go, but you believe for
[1:36:47] them.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; And God, I I I gave an example before
[1:36:51] them. I live before them. And my faith
[1:36:53] is not my confidence is not in what I
[1:36:56] did. My confidence is in what you have
[1:36:58] already done. And my confidence is in
[1:37:01] the faithfulness of the Holy Ghost,
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; the mighty Holy Spirit.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, I'm ready to
[1:37:09] preach.
[1:37:11] That's where our confidence in. The
[1:37:13] whole world has all of their little
[1:37:15] significant times and all it is. It's a
[1:37:17] laben. It's a laben syndrome.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; You won't forget that. Just a laben
[1:37:22] syndrome. The job, the work, all the
[1:37:25] things, what I need and my bills and all
[1:37:28] the rest of just a heap of stones. But
[1:37:30] to the believer, it's more than a heap
[1:37:32] of stones. And you, that's what will
[1:37:35] turn it into something significant. And
[1:37:38] remember, it was the same heap of
[1:37:40] stones.
[1:37:41] The same heap of stones that to Laban
[1:37:44] was just a heap.
[1:37:47] But Jacob says, "I'm going to give a
[1:37:49] different name because it means
[1:37:52] something different to me. I'm here the
[1:37:54] same heap of stones. It's just a heap to
[1:37:56] you. Just a job, just a life, just a
[1:37:59] bunch of material things and so on. I
[1:38:01] don't condemn it, but use it for the
[1:38:03] kingdom of God. This heap of stones for
[1:38:05] me is an opportunity to serve Christ.
[1:38:08] Opportunity to serve the bride.
[1:38:10] Opportunity. And that's what we've built
[1:38:12] this church on. I tell you what,
[1:38:14] friends.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; All our resources and all the things. We
[1:38:19] just keep trying to pour it out and pour
[1:38:20] it out and pour it out and sending these
[1:38:23] brothers out that go to different places
[1:38:24] and we're just trying to pour out all
[1:38:27] the resources and all the help that we
[1:38:29] can to people who other brothers and
[1:38:31] sisters. It doesn't matter whether I
[1:38:33] know them or I don't know them, whether
[1:38:34] I see them or don't see them. It makes
[1:38:37] no difference to me.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; We went to the Philippines the first
[1:38:43] time and I I saw all those ministers,
[1:38:46] about 250 I met in about a week's time.
[1:38:49] I only got to shake hands with a few of
[1:38:51] them. And I I just I then I learned that
[1:38:54] they did. Out of 150,
[1:38:58] 92 ministers didn't have one tape of
[1:39:02] brother Brandham's out of 150 ministers.
[1:39:06] You think I could come here? I never
[1:39:09] went back to the Philippines. I haven't
[1:39:11] been going there. I don't think it's I
[1:39:13] don't think I need to be there and
[1:39:14] preaching and so on. They had hundreds
[1:39:16] and hundreds of meetings and all kinds
[1:39:19] of ministry. And I I I I even had a hard
[1:39:22] time feeling right. I had a hard time
[1:39:25] feeling right. I go, "What are the
[1:39:27] ministers doing traveling from different
[1:39:29] places in the world and and and
[1:39:31] preaching conventions and conventions
[1:39:33] and conventions and conventions and then
[1:39:35] leave and these men don't even have the
[1:39:37] prophet's message
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; and they can understand English for the
[1:39:40] most part and they don't 92 don't have
[1:39:43] one tape." You know what I said to
[1:39:44] myself? What do they preach next Sunday?
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; What do they preach?
[1:39:54] And we said on a mission,
[1:39:56] get these tapes out. Start duplicating
[1:39:58] them. Find out whether we duplicate them
[1:40:01] here, brother. And he says, "There's a
[1:40:02] man in Florida. We'll try and get them
[1:40:03] in Florida. We'll get them from Voice of
[1:40:06] God, whatever. Let's let's order 50
[1:40:08] cents right away and get them over
[1:40:10] there." And somebody says, "We'll
[1:40:11] donate." A church in Edmonton said,
[1:40:13] "We'll donate a duplicator." Okay. Well,
[1:40:16] let's let's get the tape from Singapore.
[1:40:17] That's where they're coming from anyway.
[1:40:19] And start duplicating them and getting
[1:40:20] them. and uh and and we found ourselves
[1:40:22] in the middle of the fire. We found
[1:40:25] ourselves in the middle of people didn't
[1:40:28] didn't see it right. They didn't see
[1:40:29] what it was we're trying to do and got
[1:40:31] all kinds of resistance and all kinds of
[1:40:34] bad things said. I tell you what,
[1:40:38] to me it wasn't just a heap of stones,
[1:40:40] not just some tapes.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; People say, "Oh, you know, Biscll trying
[1:40:44] to make a big name for himself. My how
[1:40:47] false that is, how untrue that is." and
[1:40:49] just trying to see that God's bride is
[1:40:52] blessed. But in the meantime, in the
[1:40:55] meantime, I have the Jacob syndrome.
[1:40:57] I'll tell you, it's the last message I
[1:40:59] preach. I'll tell you, I believe in the
[1:41:00] Jacob syndrome. If they're if they're I
[1:41:03] if they keep all the good ones, God will
[1:41:05] give me the ringstrake ones.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; He'll give me the spotted ones. He'll
[1:41:09] give me the ugly ones if necessary. But
[1:41:11] God will bless their work.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God will bless this. He
[1:41:16] He'll He'll raise up the prostitutes off
[1:41:19] the street, the drug addicts if he needs
[1:41:21] to. He'll take the singles and the
[1:41:23] single mothers, single fathers. He'll do
[1:41:25] whatever he needs to do. But his kingdom
[1:41:28] will succeed. Amen. And I believe in the
[1:41:31] ones that God has gathered here. I
[1:41:33] believe in the families. I believe in
[1:41:35] the people. Whoever God brought here, I
[1:41:38] say God bless you.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; To me, the congregation here is not just
[1:41:42] a congregation, not just another pile of
[1:41:44] stones. I see it as a covenant of
[1:41:47] almighty God. I see God having kept his
[1:41:50] word. I see God gathering his bride. And
[1:41:54] I can say to you, the sun is up, folks.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:59] It's hard not to get enthused, excited
[1:42:01] about a message that we have. Children,
[1:42:03] the sun is up.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham to me is not just a
[1:42:13] prophet either.
[1:42:15] been like a father to us,
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; one they haven't seen, but one that
[1:42:20] prayed. And Jesus said, "I don't pray
[1:42:22] for these alone, Father, but I pray for
[1:42:25] all those that will believe on me
[1:42:29] through their word." Jesus prayed for
[1:42:33] you,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; sitting right where you are. You're not
[1:42:37] just a human body. You're not just a
[1:42:39] heap of stones to Jesus. He prayed for
[1:42:41] you. Do you believe John 17? He prayed
[1:42:45] for you.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; You want to read it tonight when you go
[1:42:48] home as I did last night and see how
[1:42:50] many times thou those that thou has
[1:42:53] given me. Those that thou has given me.
[1:42:56] Those that thou has given me. Thine they
[1:42:58] wear.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; I always wear yours, but you gave them
[1:43:03] to me. Hallelujah.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:43:09] Christ. Oh God, how we thank you. Thank
[1:43:12] you, Lord. This is not just a heap of
[1:43:14] stones to us. Even this service tonight
[1:43:16] is not just a heap of stones. It's a
[1:43:19] covenant keeping time. It's a time when
[1:43:22] you confirm your word. Oh, it's a time
[1:43:24] when we have eyesight, the eyesight of
[1:43:27] faith. Oh God, I pray you'll take this
[1:43:30] people tonight and that you will
[1:43:32] invigorate them. I pray you'll fill them
[1:43:35] with the Holy Ghost. I ask that you'll
[1:43:38] make every promise, Lord, that they've
[1:43:40] heard tonight. I pray you'll make it a
[1:43:42] reality to them. And while others are
[1:43:44] falling away and while others are
[1:43:47] committing spiritual suicide, we see it
[1:43:50] as a great opportunity.
[1:43:52] Oh, bless your people. Bless your
[1:43:54] ministers. Bless your servants, oh God.
[1:43:57] Bless the deacons. I pray in the name of
[1:43:59] Jesus Christ. Bless the trustees. Give
[1:44:02] them supreme divine wisdom. Bless the
[1:44:05] school teachers. Lord, I pray you'll
[1:44:07] bless the Sunday school teachers, our
[1:44:09] brother Richard. Oh God, bless those
[1:44:11] that work in the video. Lord, in the
[1:44:14] sound system, I pray you'll bless, oh
[1:44:16] God, the people that are out ministering
[1:44:18] right now. Father, bless and be with our
[1:44:21] brother Tony and sister Rebecca. Oh God,
[1:44:23] how they're burning up their energy
[1:44:25] right now. The mo the least we can do is
[1:44:27] pray for them. I pray, oh God, for the
[1:44:29] meetings on Sunday. I pray you'll fill
[1:44:32] this place with a holy milky cloud of
[1:44:35] faith upon the people. May signs and
[1:44:38] wonders be done to the glory of the holy
[1:44:41] name of Jesus Christ. Oh God, I know
[1:44:44] that these people support me. Sometime
[1:44:46] they're quiet, but I know in their
[1:44:48] heart, oh God, they're feeding on the
[1:44:50] word and they love your word. We love
[1:44:53] this covenant.
[1:44:55] We love this covenant word. The covenant
[1:44:58] that you've given to us in this time and
[1:45:00] your promise will never be forgotten.
[1:45:04] You will certainly fulfill it.
[1:45:07] And you will bring us, oh God, as a
[1:45:09] people
[1:45:11] into a new place and new heaven
[1:45:14] and a new earth wherein dwells
[1:45:16] righteousness.
[1:45:18] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, we love you. Amen.
[1:45:23] Hallelujah.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Well, let's sing. Let's sing something.
[1:45:34] I don't have a song. Somebody got a
[1:45:36] song.
[1:45:39] Musicians don't have a song.
[1:45:46] All right.
[1:45:48] They sang uh I want to sing uh
[1:45:56] um
[1:45:58] if I had the only believe book, I know
[1:45:59] exactly where it is. It was uh living by
[1:46:03] faith is living by faith. Let's stand as
[1:46:06] we sing it.
[1:46:09] Hallelujah.
[1:46:12] Before we sing it, do you believe it?
[1:46:15] You young people believe it especially.
[1:46:17] You believe it? Young ladies, young
[1:46:20] fellas, you believe it.
[1:46:22] You think brother Biscll gets excited?
[1:46:26] You should have seen me when I was about
[1:46:27] 19.
[1:46:29] I could jump around those days.
[1:46:32] Hallelujah.
[1:46:34] Brother Brandham said he believes it
[1:46:36] exactly the same since he was just a
[1:46:38] young fellow preaching it. I can tell
[1:46:41] you I I see things a whole lot
[1:46:43] different, but since the message came to
[1:46:45] me, but since the message came, it's
[1:46:48] been a wonderful,
[1:46:50] wonderful time. Hallelujah.
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:46:56] Hallelujah. My my my.

[1:50:45] Just sing the chorus again. We're going

[1:50:55] Pray God's blessing upon them. Oh my.
[1:51:00] Hallelujah.
[1:51:01] I feel a love of God.
[1:51:04] My heart
[1:51:06] in prayer just before I came to the
[1:51:08] pulpit, it just began to bless me. God
[1:51:10] is love. He's compassionate.
[1:51:15] He's merciful.
[1:51:17] He's forgiving.
[1:51:20] He's long-suffering. I love all of those
[1:51:22] things. But above all, God is love. Not
[1:51:27] the kind of weak need love that we know
[1:51:30] about, but God loves
[1:51:33] regardless of where we are or
[1:51:36] we all have failed. Regardless of what,
[1:51:39] you know, what our failings might be,
[1:51:40] God is love. He's going to love us and
[1:51:44] see us through. and his love will never
[1:51:47] let us go. I ask you, what will separate
[1:51:50] us from the love of God in Christ Jesus?
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Heights nor depths nor trouble
[1:51:55] or circumstances or heaps of stones or
[1:51:57] or job or failure or success or sickness
[1:52:00] or any of this will separate us. No.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Do we hear it? No. Hallelujah. Nothing
[1:52:08] can separate us from the love of God in
[1:52:11] Christ Jesus. He loved us too much.
[1:52:14] Praise the Lord. I'm enthused about it.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to be loved
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; with that kind of love.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; It will not dim.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; It will not change.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:32] I'm living by faith
[1:52:36] in Jesus.
[1:52:41] trusting to flying
[1:52:45] in his great love. Like trusting in your
[1:52:48] love, Lord. All our faith
[1:52:53] in his world.
[1:52:58] Living by faith. Living by faith.
[1:53:07] Hallelujah.

[1:53:15] Let's our heads.
[1:53:19] Our precious Lord Jesus. How wonderful
[1:53:22] it is Lord God to know Lord that we have
[1:53:26] received the covenant,
[1:53:29] the witness Lord, not the Leven
[1:53:32] syndrome, Lord. How thankful we are,
[1:53:35] Lord God, that when this message was
[1:53:38] introduced to us, Lord, that it rang
[1:53:40] true in our hearts, Lord God, that it
[1:53:42] spoke to the seed down inside and
[1:53:44] awakened it to the reality of who we are
[1:53:47] and what we are, Lord God, and what you
[1:53:49] expect of us in this day. And Lord, how
[1:53:52] we are going to rise. We are rising,
[1:53:55] Lord, to those greater heights in Christ
[1:53:58] Jesus, Lord God. And we're so thankful,
[1:54:00] Lord, that we have ministry as we have
[1:54:02] here, Lord Jesus. Lord God, that we
[1:54:05] could, Lord, just climb a little higher
[1:54:08] in Christ Jesus, Lord God, just to come,
[1:54:11] Lord, to where you expect us to be, Lord
[1:54:13] God.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, that bride without spot or
[1:54:16] wrinkle, Lord,
[1:54:18] rising to be beside you forever more,
[1:54:21] Lord God. We pray, Father God, that you
[1:54:24] would bless each of us, Lord. Lord, to
[1:54:26] tuck this deep in our hearts, Lord, this
[1:54:28] treasure, Lord Jesus. Lord, that the
[1:54:30] world would cast aside. But Lord, that
[1:54:35] Lord, you had sold all to go and buy
[1:54:37] that field, Lord. We just so thank you,
[1:54:40] Father. Lord, that we are that treasure
[1:54:42] in that field, Lord. And Lord, we are
[1:54:45] just coming home to you. We thank you,
[1:54:48] Father. We pray that you would bless us
[1:54:50] now, Lord, just to ponder on these
[1:54:52] things, Lord God, and just snug up
[1:54:54] closer to you. Bless our pastor, Lord,
[1:54:57] as he would travel, Lord, for the
[1:54:58] dedication, Lord. Give him strength,
[1:55:00] Lord, as that 19year-old man, Lord God.
[1:55:04] Lord, a man of 90 would jump and click
[1:55:06] his heels. And where were you before I
[1:55:08] laid the foundation of the world, Lord,
[1:55:11] give him that supernatural strength,
[1:55:13] Lord, may you go with the prayers of the
[1:55:15] saints. Lord, we thank you in Jesus
[1:55:18] name. Hallelujah.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Why don't we greet one another? Not only
[1:55:32] God bless you. Praise the Lord. Let them
[1:55:33] know the sun is shining.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:39] You can say it. Don't be afraid. This is
[1:55:41] your This is This is a place you can
[1:55:43] worship. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
