[29:29] how many have you need tonight
[29:31] how many believe that the Lord has a
[29:32] word for you tonight
[29:34] as brother Darren prayed I so appreciate
[29:36] I say Lord on Sunday I receive a word
[29:38] from you and tonight I believe it is a
[29:41] word for me that's our attitude when we
[29:43] come to the house of God lord speak to
[29:45] my heart
[29:46] and I want to sit in the back there I
[29:49] come to church with a desire with a need
[29:51] and I keep it before the Lord throughout
[29:53] the service
[29:54] and I say Lord your word is a discern
[29:56] our thoughts an interest of my hearts
[29:58] let your word address the needs that I
[30:00] have in my heart and I will not be
[30:02] satisfied if the service goes until the
[30:05] end and you've not spoken to me
[30:06] regarding my needs that should be your
[30:08] attitude tonight and say Lord I'm gonna
[30:10] hold this before you tonight make sure
[30:13] you you touch this night address this
[30:15] area of my life speak to me about this I
[30:18] have this request Lord I have this
[30:20] question Lord how many will do it
[30:22] tonight
[30:23] before we go into the word and before I
[30:25] read our Bibles there's a quote that I'd
[30:27] like to share with you if the brothers
[30:28] can put that up for me
[30:30] for the past four weeks I've not been
[30:32] able to
[30:33] escape this quote it just keeps coming
[30:35] back over and over again and this may be
[30:37] know what that's like
[30:39] where the Lord seem to be you know
[30:42] zeroing you know the particular
[30:43] scriptural quotes I'd like to read that
[30:45] to you before we get into the word
[30:47] problem says this
[30:49] and when I was coming over I was
[30:50] thinking of the infallibility of God's
[30:53] spoken word
[30:54] it's just perfect and if we could only
[30:57] eat this audience you
[31:00] in this audience tonight
[31:02] if Clover the Bible away tonight
[31:04] could only get settled in their mind
[31:07] who said this
[31:11] what this really is this spoken word
[31:16] would not need any healing service we
[31:18] will not need any salvation article it
[31:21] will be finished if you just realize
[31:23] what the word was and I says now let's
[31:26] look at it so to now we're going to look
[31:28] at this we're going to look at what this
[31:30] word is
[31:32] who said this word and what this word is
[31:35] this spoken word and it by the preaching
[31:37] of the word it can be settled in your
[31:39] mind what the word is and who spoke
[31:42] these words we cannot leave the service
[31:44] tonight without an altar call without a
[31:47] healing service but everybody will go
[31:49] back home healed
[31:50] anybody who's bound will go back from
[31:52] delivered anybody who was the new will
[31:54] find the answer to the need if we can
[31:56] only settle in your mind what this word
[31:58] is
[31:59] [Music]
[32:02] I don't speak presumptuously when I said
[32:04] I believe I received the word of the
[32:05] Lord for tonight
[32:06] and this is what God wants me to speak
[32:08] on tonight and if I can only get you to
[32:10] see this word
[32:11] if it can only help your faith tonight
[32:13] to see why the prophet of God is saying
[32:16] here
[32:17] this will be a special night for you how
[32:19] many believe that
[32:21] let's take our Bibles let's open in the
[32:23] book of second Corinthians chapter one
[32:25] thank you musician
[32:27] [Music]
[32:34] [Music]
[32:37] second Corinthians chapter one beginning
[32:39] in verse
[32:41] verse 18.
[32:48] But as God is true
[32:50] our word toward you was not yea and a
[32:54] for the Son of God Jesus Christ who was
[32:56] preached among you by us even by me and
[32:59] Sylvanas and timothius was not yea and
[33:02] nay but in him was yea for all the
[33:04] promises of God in him are yea and in
[33:07] him amen unto the glory of God by us
[33:12] let's also turn in the Book of
[33:14] Revelation chapter 3.
[33:17] very familiar scripture
[33:29] verse 14.
[33:34] Revelation 3 14.
[33:36] and unto the angel of the Church of the
[33:38] laodiceans right
[33:40] these things saved the amen the faithful
[33:43] and true witness the beginning of the
[33:46] creation of God Amen you may be seated
[33:53] prayer is we approach the word
[33:56] Heavenly Father we exalted tonight Lord
[33:59] and you have exalted Thy word Above All
[34:01] Things Lord
[34:02] we've come to be fed we've come to speak
[34:05] your word we've come to believe your
[34:07] word and to receive your word I pray
[34:09] that the Holy Spirit Will anoint your
[34:10] word to our hearts and may the things
[34:12] that we read come to pass in Jesus name
[34:15] amen
[34:20] I like to take for a title tonight
[34:22] I won't be long
[34:26] amen
[34:28] so be it
[34:30] that's my title tonight amen so be it
[34:36] now brother says
[34:39] in the scripture the revenue Revelation
[34:41] chapter 3 is Jesus addressing himself to
[34:44] the senior churches and if you read from
[34:47] chapter 2 to chapter 3 the message to
[34:49] the seven Church ages
[34:50] to every Church age when Jesus speaks to
[34:53] Germany says write these things and he
[34:55] addresses himself or he introduces
[34:56] himself or a characteristics of himself
[34:59] to that church age
[35:01] to the Ephesian church he says he that
[35:03] hold at the Seven Stars in his right
[35:05] hand who walketh in the midst of the
[35:06] seven golden candlesticks so that's how
[35:08] he introduced himself to that church
[35:10] to Smyrna it says the first and the last
[35:13] which was dead and which is alive
[35:15] the program message says he which have
[35:17] the sharp sword with the edges tatara it
[35:20] says this thing says the Son of God who
[35:23] have his eyes like unto a flame of fire
[35:24] and his feet are like fine brass
[35:27] to start this he says he that had the
[35:29] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[35:32] to Philadelphia he introduce himself he
[35:34] says this thing say of he that is Holy
[35:36] he that is true he that have the Key of
[35:39] David he that openeth and Norman Sharif
[35:42] and Sharif and no man openeth
[35:45] now we come to deliver the senior Church
[35:46] Asian verse 14. what he introduced
[35:49] himself to John and says write these
[35:51] things these things safe the amen
[35:55] now he introduce himself differently
[35:57] than he did in the previous Church ages
[36:01] his introduction says I am the amen
[36:05] I am the faithful and the true witness
[36:07] the beginning of the creation of God
[36:10] says this like this my isn't that the
[36:13] most wonderful description of the
[36:14] attributes of our lovely Lord and Savior
[36:16] Jesus Christ these words just make me
[36:19] want to shout he says they bring such a
[36:21] spiritual reality into my heart just
[36:23] reading them without even waiting for a
[36:24] third revelation of the spirit upon them
[36:26] it fills me Jesus is giving us a
[36:29] description of himself in relation to
[36:32] the last age now that's an important
[36:34] statement this description throughout
[36:36] the seven churches each description was
[36:38] in relation to that specific Church age
[36:42] the description that Jesus chose for
[36:44] this church age he says I am the amen
[36:47] and brother continues and says the days
[36:49] of grace are winding up
[36:51] he has looked from the first century
[36:53] right through to the 20th and told us
[36:55] all things concerning these ages
[36:58] before he reveals the characteristics of
[37:00] the last age to us he gives us one final
[37:02] look at his own gracious and supreme
[37:05] deity
[37:07] this is the Capstone revelation of
[37:10] himself
[37:12] and we know the Capstone comes in the
[37:13] end time the camisole is a final element
[37:16] to to to uh that comes upon the the
[37:19] search of a perfect man so what he's
[37:21] saying here is that the Capstone
[37:22] Revelation is a revelation of the amen
[37:25] It's the final Revelation and God
[37:28] introduced himself to the senior
[37:30] churches as being the one who is the
[37:33] amen
[37:34] let's carry on thus save the Amen
[37:37] brother says Jesus is the amen of God
[37:39] Amen my I love that
[37:41] Jesus is the amen of God Jesus is the
[37:46] solidic being of God amen stands for
[37:49] finality it stands for approval it
[37:52] stands for prevailing promise it stands
[37:55] for unchanging promise it stands for the
[37:57] Seal of God
[37:58] the Capstone revelation of Jesus Christ
[38:01] in the lyrics in the church ages I am
[38:04] the amen I am the word I am the so being
[38:07] of God in other words I am the one who
[38:10] makes these things to come to pass
[38:12] Jesus is that word which is the amen of
[38:15] God when God speaks something why he
[38:19] speaks is Jesus as we sing I speak Jesus
[38:22] what is the message Jesus what is the
[38:25] message the amen it's the cups of
[38:27] revelation of Jesus Christ in his last
[38:29] days God is letting us know to this
[38:31] level see in church I am the amen
[38:35] I am the Soviet and whatever I say is
[38:37] final
[38:39] and I stand for prevailing promise so
[38:42] all my promises are yea and amen
[38:45] everything that I've declared from the
[38:47] first church age in the last church is
[38:49] final
[38:51] I will not alter the words that came out
[38:53] of my mouth the scripture says my
[38:55] Covenant will you will I keep there is
[38:57] nothing in the word of God that God is
[38:59] going to alter there's some
[39:01] circumstances in laodicea
[39:03] there's nothing in his word is going to
[39:05] take away or change or altar because of
[39:08] the realities of this age
[39:10] he swore by himself because he is the
[39:13] amen of God and he's come to John to let
[39:15] you know tell us people in laodicea
[39:17] especially the message of that age I am
[39:20] the amen and I've come to fulfill my
[39:22] word pertaining to this age
[39:25] and whatever I say is final
[39:32] like it continues and this is from the
[39:34] church age book in The Living Church he
[39:36] continues and connects the scripture
[39:38] Revelation 3 14 to Isaiah 65. that says
[39:42] that he will bless himself in the Earth
[39:44] shall bless himself in the god of Truth
[39:47] and he does swerve in the earth Shall
[39:49] Serve by the god of truth because the
[39:51] former troubles are forgotten and
[39:53] because they're a hit from mine eyes now
[39:55] he says the word truth here in look in
[39:56] the Bible the word truth there is amen
[39:59] in the Hebrews are men
[40:01] and brother says he is the god of the
[40:04] amen
[40:06] he never changes
[40:08] what he does never changes he says it
[40:11] and it stands fast
[40:13] he does it and it's done forever
[40:16] none can take from what he says or add
[40:18] to it what he says is final final means
[40:21] there's no alteration to it you cannot
[40:24] add to it and you cannot remove from it
[40:26] and it says
[40:28] so let it be amen so let it be aren't
[40:32] you glad that you served that kind of a
[40:34] god
[40:35] aren't you glad to know that you serve
[40:37] the god of the amen aren't you God that
[40:39] you serve Jesus Christ the amen of God
[40:41] because you can rest your faith upon his
[40:44] every word because it's final
[40:50] he says you can know exactly where you
[40:52] are with him at any time
[40:54] God doesn't play games
[40:58] he is the amen and God won't change this
[41:02] thing said the amen he says I like that
[41:04] it means that whatever he said is final
[41:06] it means that whatever he said to the
[41:08] first age and to the second age and to
[41:11] all the ages about his own true church
[41:13] and about the false fun is exactly right
[41:15] and you won't change it also means that
[41:18] while he started out with in Genesis he
[41:22] will finish in Revelation
[41:23] he asked for he has to for he is amen so
[41:27] let it be everything that God has
[41:30] promised in Genesis he fulfills in
[41:32] Revelation in other words every word of
[41:35] God is that's been spoken in Seal form
[41:37] he'll bring it to pass
[41:39] right because Revelation is the
[41:41] manifestation so what God has sown in
[41:43] Genesis what he is spoken his seed from
[41:46] he's letting us know in this age I'll
[41:48] bring it to pass
[41:51] now the Bible in Revelation chapter 22.
[41:56] ends the very last verse of the Bible
[41:58] and the very last word of the Bible as a
[42:00] matter of fact is amen
[42:02] if you read revelation 22 verse 20 he
[42:05] which testify these things saved surely
[42:07] I come quickly
[42:09] a man even so come Lord Jesus
[42:11] verse 21 the grace of our Lord Jesus
[42:14] Christ be with you all
[42:16] amen
[42:18] and that's how the Bible ends God
[42:20] punctuates his word the last verse the
[42:23] last word of the Bible the last book the
[42:26] last chapter the last line the last word
[42:28] amen
[42:30] God wants you to know sorry let it be
[42:33] everything that he said it will be Let
[42:36] It Be amen so be it everything that was
[42:40] spoken in this word so be it from
[42:42] Genesis 1 1 to Revelation 20 to 21 so be
[42:46] it from later big you know beginning God
[42:49] created from that very first verse to
[42:51] the last verse of the Bible even so come
[42:54] let the bless our Lord Jesus Christ be
[42:55] with you the Bible ends with amen and
[42:59] God punctuates his word by saying Amen
[43:02] to it
[43:07] now the word amen appears in many places
[43:09] in the scripture and let's go through
[43:10] through some of them here
[43:12] I'm not going to I'm not going to go
[43:14] through all them for the sake of time
[43:16] first chronicles 16 36 blessed be the
[43:18] Lord
[43:20] blessed be the Lord God of Israel
[43:21] forever and ever and all the people said
[43:24] amen and praise the Lord
[43:26] so this word appears in many forms in
[43:28] the Bible in Isaiah 65 as read it
[43:31] appears as the word truth the god of
[43:32] Truth which is the god of Amen it also
[43:35] appears when Jesus says verily verily
[43:38] that means truly truly and it also means
[43:40] amen amen
[43:42] so whenever Jesus in the scripture was
[43:44] saying verily verily what he's saying
[43:46] amen amen he's saying that the words
[43:48] that I'm speaking now will come to pass
[43:51] the words that I'm speaking are true for
[43:53] I am the amen of God amen amen verily
[43:56] verily I say unto you
[44:00] Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 6 and Ezra
[44:02] bless the Lord the great God and all the
[44:04] people answered amen amen with lifting
[44:07] up their hands and about their heads and
[44:09] Worship the Lord with their faces to the
[44:11] ground
[44:12] Psalms 41 13.
[44:14] blessed be the Lord God of Israel from
[44:17] Everlasting and to Everlasting amen and
[44:20] amen
[44:21] Psalm 72 verse 19 and blessed be his
[44:24] glorious name forever and let the whole
[44:26] earth be filled with his glory amen and
[44:28] amen
[44:29] Psalms 89 52 blessed be the Lord
[44:32] forevermore amen and amen John 21 25 and
[44:37] there are also many other things which
[44:38] Jesus did though which if they should be
[44:40] written everyone I suppose that even the
[44:43] whole the world itself could not contain
[44:45] the books that should be written amen
[44:47] Romans 11 36 for of him and through him
[44:50] and to him are all things to him being
[44:53] Glory forever amen Romans 15 33 now the
[44:57] god of peace be with you all amen first
[45:00] John 5 21 Little Children keep
[45:02] yourselves from Idols amen Revelation 1
[45:05] 7 behold he cometh with cloud and every
[45:07] hour shall see him and they also reach
[45:09] Pierce him and all kingdoms of the Earth
[45:11] shall wail because of him even so amen
[45:15] Revelation 1 18 I am he that liveth I
[45:18] was dead and behold I Am Alive
[45:19] forevermore amen
[45:24] now the prophet says
[45:26] and I believe one we believe God
[45:29] every time God says anything we
[45:31] punctuated with amen
[45:34] that's right whatever God said he said
[45:37] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to
[45:38] them forever somebody will say well in a
[45:41] way amen
[45:43] if he said repent and be baptized and
[45:45] receive the Holy Ghost amen see if he
[45:48] said to Joshua live by faith amen and he
[45:51] said I will come again amen and he said
[45:53] you're the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[45:55] and he said bye by straps you were
[45:57] healed amen I'm the god I giveth you
[45:59] peace amen receive you the Holy Ghost
[46:01] amen everything that the Holy Ghost
[46:03] speaks the Holy Ghost in us will
[46:05] punctuate it with an amen because it's
[46:08] the Holy Ghost agreeing with his own
[46:10] word
[46:11] it's not about saying amen because you
[46:13] want to say Amen it's a right thing to
[46:15] say in the service it's when the Holy
[46:17] Ghost punctuates that word in your soul
[46:19] bearing weaknesses of what he's saying
[46:22] is true to you that's when God speaks to
[46:24] you personally
[46:25] right it's not about the motion going
[46:28] through the motions of saying Amen in
[46:29] the service but it's about the Holy
[46:31] Spirit punctuating his own work as they
[46:34] come across a Pulpit and as always being
[46:36] ministered every service and as it is
[46:38] ministered tonight there will be a
[46:40] statement that is said there'll be a
[46:42] scripture read there will be a quote
[46:43] read and something in you will say Amen
[46:46] and that is the holy ghost personalizing
[46:49] that word to you bearing weakness of
[46:52] that word personally to you
[46:55] amen
[46:58] he says let's go back to Calvary and get
[47:01] the real stock of the Holy Ghost in us
[47:03] then you know where you stand you know
[47:06] who your father is and every time then
[47:08] the Bible says anything you punctuate it
[47:10] with amen
[47:12] the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same
[47:14] yesterday to them forever the old donkey
[47:16] might say I don't know about that but
[47:17] the real genuine pedigree says amen
[47:22] you get the Bachelor of the Holy Ghost
[47:23] and you believe
[47:24] in God's power
[47:26] you believe every word God says and you
[47:29] punctuate it with that
[47:31] to everything God says
[47:34] another quote and a good Thoroughbred
[47:36] Christian knows where the storehouse of
[47:38] God is they know that they are born of
[47:41] God the word is made flesh in them and
[47:43] every word that God says they don't
[47:45] differ with it they say it's right amen
[47:48] and amen they punctuated with an amen
[47:51] every time amen amen amen something in
[47:54] them punctuates it
[47:56] himself
[47:58] something in them something in you
[48:01] punctuates the word and what is that
[48:03] something he says himself
[48:05] the word himself
[48:08] punctuates the word in you the word in
[48:11] you agrees with the word that's coming
[48:13] across the pulpit it's the Holy Spirit
[48:15] bearing witness to his own word and
[48:18] testifying on the amen of God and I'm
[48:20] saying Amen to what is being ministered
[48:22] I'm acknowledging that to be true and I
[48:25] will bring that to pass
[48:26] that's what happens when your soul cries
[48:28] amen if you're saying no whatever you're
[48:30] speaking I agree with your word and the
[48:33] Holy Ghost he means bang witness that
[48:35] you will bring it to come to pass in my
[48:37] life amen
[48:40] you don't say anything to every
[48:41] statement do you without
[48:43] we say Amen to why God makes real to us
[48:45] in the service because that is the word
[48:47] is about to bring to pass in your life
[48:49] so listen carefully to the web being
[48:51] Minister tonight when suffering you
[48:53] Wells up and says amen it's the Holy
[48:55] Ghost bang weakness that he will bring
[48:57] it to pass in your life
[48:59] amen
[49:04] Jesus is the amen of God
[49:08] now
[49:09] the first occurrence of this word amen
[49:12] in the Hebrews Amen in the Greek which
[49:15] we read in the New Testament in the
[49:16] Greek it's Amen
[49:18] which was said at the end of a statement
[49:21] of a prayer as read in the New Testament
[49:23] blessed be the Lord Our God Amen may
[49:26] peace and peace and Grace be unto you
[49:28] amen so amen was said at the end of his
[49:30] statement
[49:31] and a lot of this statement it says
[49:33] making it personal
[49:35] and making this petition or prayer
[49:37] thereon
[49:40] so the person who's ministering or
[49:42] saying a prayer when you say Amen to it
[49:45] in a great year it means that you're
[49:47] you're making that plea or that petition
[49:50] you're on
[49:51] as though you were the one saying it
[49:53] say I'm making this my own by agreeing
[49:56] with it I'm saying Amen to it let those
[49:59] words which we speak become my own
[50:03] now in Numbers chapter five let's turn
[50:05] to the scripture
[50:07] this is the first occurrence of this
[50:09] word in the Bible
[50:17] now brother Murphy I believe last year
[50:19] spoke on this chapter
[50:22] and I strongly recommend that you go
[50:24] back and listen to that service
[50:26] I didn't listen to it because I was
[50:28] going to be preaching on the same
[50:29] chapter and I didn't want to go in a
[50:31] different direction but I remember it
[50:33] vividly it was the spirit of jealousy
[50:35] brother Murphy you remember that go back
[50:37] and listen to that service it will do
[50:39] you good we're going different way
[50:40] tonight but this is the first time in
[50:43] the Bible where we see this word
[50:45] Numbers Chapter 5 we can begin verse 11.
[50:50] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[50:53] speak unto the children of Israel
[50:55] and say unto them if any man's wife go
[50:59] aside and commit a trespass against him
[51:01] and a man alive with her carnally and
[51:03] he'd be hid from the eyes of the husband
[51:05] and be kept close and should be defiled
[51:08] and there'll be no witness against her
[51:09] neither she be taken with the manner and
[51:12] the spirit of jealousy come upon him and
[51:15] he'll be jealous of his wife and should
[51:17] be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy
[51:19] come upon him and she'd be jealous of
[51:21] his wife but should be not defiled then
[51:23] shall the man bring his wife unto the
[51:25] priest
[51:26] and he shall bring her offering for her
[51:29] the tenth part of anitha of Barley Mill
[51:32] he shall pour no oil upon it nor put
[51:34] frankincense thereon for it is enough
[51:37] ring of jealousy an offering of Memorial
[51:39] bringing iniquity to remembrance
[51:41] and the priest shall bring her near and
[51:44] set her before the Lord
[51:45] now pay attention to something from
[51:47] verse 17. and the priest shall take holy
[51:49] water in the Earthen vessel and of the
[51:52] dust that is in the floor of the
[51:53] Tabernacle the priest shall take and put
[51:55] it into the water
[51:56] and the preacher said the woman before
[51:58] the Lord and uncovered the woman's head
[52:00] and put the offering of Memorial in her
[52:03] hands which is a jealousy offering and
[52:06] the priest shall shave shall have in his
[52:07] hand the beetle water that causes that
[52:10] cause of the curse
[52:12] and the priest shall charge her by an
[52:13] oath and say unto the woman if no man
[52:17] have laid with thee and if that was gone
[52:19] that thou has not gone aside to
[52:22] uncleanness with another instead of thy
[52:23] husband be thou free from this Beetle
[52:26] water that causes the curse
[52:28] but if thou has gone aside to another
[52:31] instead of thy husband and if that be
[52:33] defiled and some men have leaned with
[52:35] thee beside their husband then the
[52:37] priest shall charge the woman with an
[52:39] oath of cursing and the priest shall say
[52:41] unto the woman the Lord make thee a
[52:43] curse and an oath among thy people when
[52:46] the Lord's death made thy side to rot
[52:48] and I barely to swell
[52:50] in other words it was going to Shadow a
[52:52] woman and this water that causes the
[52:54] curse shall go into the bowels to make
[52:56] that Bailey to surround the thigh to rot
[52:58] and the woman shall say amen amen
[53:02] and then the priest shall write these
[53:04] curses in the book
[53:06] now this is interesting and the priest
[53:09] shall write these curses in the book and
[53:11] then he shall brought them out with the
[53:13] bit of water
[53:14] and then he shall cause a woman to drink
[53:17] the beetle water that causes the curse
[53:19] and the water that cause of the Kershaw
[53:21] entering into her and become bitter and
[53:24] when the priest shall take the jealousy
[53:25] offering of the woman's hand and shall
[53:27] weigh the offering before the Lord and
[53:28] offer it upon the Altar and the priest
[53:30] shall take a handful of the offering
[53:32] even the memorial thereof and burn it
[53:33] upon the Altar and afterwards shall
[53:36] cause a woman to drink the water and one
[53:38] he had made her to drink the water then
[53:40] it shall come to pass that if she be
[53:41] defiled and have down trespass against
[53:43] her husband the water shall cause the
[53:45] curse shall enter into her and become
[53:47] bitter and rebellious as well and her
[53:49] thighs shall route and the woman shall
[53:51] be accursed among the people
[53:52] and if the woman be not defiled but be
[53:54] clean then it shall be free and shall
[53:56] conceive seed
[53:58] it's a lengthy reading but this is the
[54:00] first mention of this word amen and amen
[54:04] in the double occurrence here amen and
[54:07] amen
[54:08] if a woman
[54:10] was guilty of adultery or the husband
[54:13] suspected that she was guilty of
[54:15] adultery and this is the offering of the
[54:19] the spirit of jealousy here and if the
[54:21] spirit of jealousy Came Upon him he will
[54:23] bring the woman to to the priest and God
[54:25] give Moses the ordinance on how to deal
[54:27] with these issues now two things will
[54:30] happen here if she was guilty the curse
[54:33] that the priest has spoken will
[54:34] materialize in our life if she was
[54:36] innocent she would go away free and be
[54:38] Vindicated that she was innocent of the
[54:40] sin
[54:41] but how does this come to play here is
[54:43] that the priest will take dust off the
[54:46] floor of the Tabernacle mix it with some
[54:48] with holy water some water and then make
[54:51] her drink the water
[54:52] but before he makes her drink the water
[54:54] he will write these words in the book
[54:58] and then when you rest the words in the
[55:00] book he now blocks the word so he takes
[55:02] the water and he wipes the ink off of
[55:05] the book another ink and the water is
[55:07] mix and it makes her drink it
[55:09] in other words he makes her drink The
[55:11] Words which he has written in the book
[55:14] and once he drinks those words God says
[55:16] she has to say Amen
[55:19] and amen
[55:21] and then if you look at the scripture
[55:23] there's nothing in this ordinance that
[55:25] can actually close a woman's womb if you
[55:27] drink water and dust that's not going to
[55:29] close your womb right
[55:31] but there's something else that takes
[55:34] place after this ordinance is met
[55:36] because God is the one who spoke these
[55:38] words he causes this word to produce in
[55:42] that woman why he said he was going to
[55:44] produce
[55:45] water and dust on its own doesn't
[55:47] produce anything but because God is the
[55:49] one who sparked those words one the
[55:52] woman receives this or performs the acts
[55:54] of God ordain and she says amen amen
[55:56] amen so be it each was guilty the
[56:00] friends of the prince has spoken will
[56:01] happen to her
[56:03] but if she wasn't guilty nothing will
[56:05] happen to her
[56:06] right
[56:07] so that's that's in a negative that's
[56:09] about a curse but let's turn this around
[56:10] in the positive
[56:13] the woman is standing before a priest
[56:16] before a preacher
[56:18] before a minister
[56:20] she's standing in the church in the
[56:22] Tabernacle and he is not pronouncing the
[56:25] words of God
[56:26] upon her
[56:28] and she is required to say amen amen
[56:33] and she must eat the word that was
[56:35] written in the book
[56:37] and once she eats the word that was
[56:39] eaten the book is that the word that she
[56:42] eats that's going to bring a change in
[56:44] her body
[56:46] it's the word that she's eating from
[56:48] that curse that's going to cause your
[56:50] belly to swell that's going to cause the
[56:52] thigh to rot what's going to bring about
[56:55] a change in our body it's the words that
[56:57] the priest has spoken and the words that
[56:59] he spought are written in the book and
[57:02] when he gets her to eat the words that
[57:03] are in the book those words perform a
[57:06] change in your life
[57:09] but for that change to come about in
[57:11] your life she says amen amen
[57:16] so Shima is the words of the scroll or
[57:18] the words that are in the book
[57:19] and now in the new test this is the Old
[57:21] Testament in the New Testament we found
[57:23] a very similar instance now in the
[57:24] positive
[57:26] there is another woman
[57:28] but she's a virgin
[57:30] she stands before Gabriel a messenger
[57:34] and he's going to speak words unto her
[57:37] and she's going to say being unto me
[57:39] according to your word in other words
[57:42] he's going to say amen amen
[57:46] and once she says amen so be it in other
[57:49] words when she says when she says amen
[57:52] amen what she's actually saying let the
[57:55] things
[57:56] that you have declared happened to me
[58:00] this is what that woman in Numbers
[58:01] Chapter 5 was required to say if I'm
[58:04] guilty of the words if I'm guilty of
[58:06] what my husband is accusing me of then
[58:08] let the things that you've spoken let
[58:10] them happen let my belly swell let my
[58:12] thyroid let those things happen to me
[58:14] amen so be it let the words on the
[58:17] priest materialize in my life let those
[58:19] things to spoken happen
[58:23] let those things that you've declared
[58:25] take place in my life if I'm guilty then
[58:28] let my tie rot but if I'm innocent then
[58:31] none of these things happen then I may
[58:32] be justified so be it I'm not running
[58:35] away from it I'm not escaping it I'm not
[58:37] fighting it so be it
[58:40] that's the attitude that God required in
[58:43] Numbers chapter five and that's the
[58:44] attitude of Mary so be it
[58:47] let the things which you're speaking let
[58:51] the words that are coming out of your
[58:52] mouth let there be a power that's going
[58:55] to make them happen so be it
[59:00] I'm not fighting it behold I'm the
[59:02] Lord's helmet be enough to not connect
[59:04] to your word if this world is of God let
[59:06] the words of Gabriel happen to me
[59:11] I'm not going to fight it I'm not going
[59:13] to escape it I'm not I'm I'm I want this
[59:15] word to capture me
[59:18] I want to be captured by the power of
[59:20] your words level things that you have
[59:22] spoken run after me let those things
[59:25] you've spoken cause me to become subject
[59:28] do the things that you've spoken that's
[59:30] the attitude of the belating heart amen
[59:32] so be it I'm not finding your word I'm
[59:35] not trying to run away from it I'm not
[59:37] trying to reason with it I'm not trying
[59:39] to debate it so be it
[59:42] if you're saying that you're my healer
[59:44] so be it let those words that you're
[59:46] declaring happen to me I'm not escaping
[59:49] and I'm saying Amen to it so be it I
[59:53] don't understand it I have no idea how
[59:55] it's going to come to pass but here I am
[59:57] before the priest let your words come to
[59:59] pass
[1:00:00] [Applause]
[1:00:00] [Music]
[1:00:02] I ain't finding you Lord I'm not
[1:00:04] rizzling against your word so be it
[1:00:07] if I'm guilty that those words come to
[1:00:09] pass let the power of your word bring a
[1:00:12] change in my life
[1:00:18] now
[1:00:19] Mary didn't know how these things were
[1:00:21] going to come to pass but now we're
[1:00:23] given the clue in the scripture the New
[1:00:24] Testament it says how will this thing be
[1:00:26] the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you
[1:00:30] now we understand that the words that
[1:00:32] were spoken by a messenger Gabriel
[1:00:34] couldn't have been materialized without
[1:00:37] the Dynamics without the holy ghost
[1:00:39] coming and making those words come to
[1:00:41] pass
[1:00:42] so now this gives us a good idea of
[1:00:44] Numbers Chapter 5. because like I said
[1:00:46] earlier on drinking water with dust
[1:00:49] doesn't cause your belly to swell or
[1:00:51] your thigh or your womb to shut it
[1:00:52] doesn't do it so what that informs us is
[1:00:55] that when the prince spoke those words
[1:00:58] because those words were not the thought
[1:01:00] of a man and they're the thought of God
[1:01:02] the Holy Ghost there was a power that
[1:01:05] followed those words that caused those
[1:01:07] words to produce the result of the word
[1:01:11] it wasn't the water of the Dust it
[1:01:13] wasn't the ink of the curse word in the
[1:01:16] book it wasn't those things that caused
[1:01:18] ability to swell or a threat to rock it
[1:01:21] was that God punctuated his word with an
[1:01:23] amen it was the Holy Ghost took the word
[1:01:26] that was spoken by a priest and made
[1:01:28] them to become material into a into a
[1:01:31] into a physical reflection of why God
[1:01:34] spoke so there was a tangible result in
[1:01:37] her body
[1:01:38] there was a body change brought about
[1:01:41] the words that was spoken of God
[1:01:43] what happened to Mary there was a body
[1:01:45] change
[1:01:46] she was a virgin and she became pregnant
[1:01:49] the words of Gabriel which are the words
[1:01:52] of Isaiah which are the thoughts of God
[1:01:54] were spoken to her and her attitude was
[1:01:57] so be it and the Holy Ghost went after
[1:01:59] that word and brought a change in her
[1:02:01] body
[1:02:02] do you believe in the body change how
[1:02:04] are you going to get a body chance is
[1:02:06] what a messenger in your day speak the
[1:02:09] thoughts of God the words of God before
[1:02:11] the foundation of the world what those
[1:02:13] things that God thought about you
[1:02:15] when the messenger begins to Proclaim
[1:02:17] his message
[1:02:19] not want to study this ministry but when
[1:02:21] it begins to Proclaim his message he
[1:02:23] begins to declare the thoughts of God
[1:02:25] concerning you and if your attitude is
[1:02:28] so big the Holy Ghost goes after that
[1:02:31] word and brings a change in your body
[1:02:34] what's going to change your body one of
[1:02:36] these days it's this message that you're
[1:02:38] feeding on
[1:02:39] if you eat the words of the book
[1:02:43] the priest has written it in the book
[1:02:45] and it's magic to eat the words
[1:02:48] John go to the angel and take the book
[1:02:52] eat the book John and if you eat the
[1:02:54] book the words that are written in the
[1:02:56] book will grow in your belly will go in
[1:02:59] your body regarding yourself and the
[1:03:01] Holy Ghost will bring your body change
[1:03:05] because you said so be it
[1:03:07] amen so be it
[1:03:11] it's not up to you
[1:03:14] it's up to the one who spoke it
[1:03:16] your attitude is not to try to make it
[1:03:18] happen
[1:03:19] your attitude is to be as vulnerable as
[1:03:21] one can be and say Here I Am do what you
[1:03:23] want
[1:03:25] that's man's attitude I am the husband
[1:03:27] of the Lord be it unto me I'm not going
[1:03:30] to try to influence this I'm not going
[1:03:32] to try to make it happen I'm not going
[1:03:33] to try to do anything about it I'm as
[1:03:35] vulnerable as I can be before your words
[1:03:37] let them happen to me let your word I'm
[1:03:40] preeminence over me let your word
[1:03:43] Supreme Over Me when my body comes to
[1:03:46] subjection to the words that you're
[1:03:48] speaking
[1:03:50] so be it
[1:03:51] if somebody tonight can only realize
[1:03:53] what this word is and who's these
[1:03:56] words and the attitude of your soul is
[1:03:58] so big
[1:03:59] they want to be a simple one among us
[1:04:01] tonight anybody who's sick can get
[1:04:03] healed tonight because all you can tell
[1:04:05] the Lord is so big
[1:04:07] so be it Lord
[1:04:09] stop it Lord if your words are true and
[1:04:12] you've said that You're My Healer let
[1:04:14] those words with response let them
[1:04:16] happen to me
[1:04:18] [Applause]
[1:04:20] Let My Life Begin to testify that those
[1:04:23] words are true so big
[1:04:26] you said you're my deliverer and I've
[1:04:29] been bound by chains for years and years
[1:04:31] and years but if your word is true so
[1:04:34] big
[1:04:36] let your work come into my life and
[1:04:38] break the chains as your words say be it
[1:04:41] unto me
[1:04:43] amen so be it
[1:04:52] let your words
[1:04:53] become flesh
[1:04:57] now in Jeremiah 28
[1:05:00] let's turn to that quickly
[1:05:02] about 20 minutes
[1:05:15] I am not even following you
[1:05:17] my nose here
[1:05:18] there's something that that spoke to me
[1:05:20] when I was great for this don't worry
[1:05:22] about your notes
[1:05:23] this is not about mechanics this is
[1:05:25] about the power of God
[1:05:28] Jeremiah 28 and it came to pass the same
[1:05:31] year in the beginning of the reign of
[1:05:32] zedekiah the king of Judah in the fourth
[1:05:35] year as verse one and in the fifth month
[1:05:37] that hananiah the son of azure the
[1:05:39] prophet which was of gibeon spake unto
[1:05:42] me in the house of the Lord again we're
[1:05:45] back in the Tabernacle
[1:05:47] in the house of the Lord in the presence
[1:05:49] of the ministers the priests and of all
[1:05:51] the people the congregation
[1:05:53] saying thus speak of the Lord of hosts
[1:05:55] the god of Israel saying I have broken
[1:05:58] the Yoke of the king of Babylon within
[1:06:00] two full years will I break again into
[1:06:02] this place all the vessels of the Lord's
[1:06:05] House that Nebuchadnezzar King of
[1:06:06] Babylon took away from this place and
[1:06:08] carried them to Babylon
[1:06:10] and I will bring again to this place
[1:06:14] king of Judah with all the captions of
[1:06:16] Judah that went into Babylon save the
[1:06:18] Lord for I will break the Yoke of the
[1:06:20] king of Babylon and when the Prophet
[1:06:22] Jeremiah then the Prophet Jeremiah said
[1:06:24] unto the prophet
[1:06:26] in the presence of the priest and in the
[1:06:28] presence of all the people that stood in
[1:06:30] the house of God
[1:06:31] even the Prophet Jeremiah said amen
[1:06:34] the Lord do so the Lord performed thy
[1:06:38] Words which thou has prophesied and
[1:06:40] bring Again The Vessel of the Lord's
[1:06:41] house and all that is carried away
[1:06:43] captive from Babylon into this place
[1:06:45] nevertheless
[1:06:47] here thou now this word that I speak in
[1:06:50] thy ears and in the ears of the people
[1:06:52] the prophets that had been before me and
[1:06:54] before thee of old prophesied both
[1:06:56] against many countries and against Great
[1:06:58] kingdoms and of war and of evil and of
[1:07:00] pestilence he's saying all the prophets
[1:07:02] that came before you and Before Me
[1:07:03] Prophet on judgment
[1:07:04] but the prophet which is going to
[1:07:06] prophesy peace which you are prophesying
[1:07:08] your peace now when the word of the
[1:07:10] Prophet shall come to pass then shall
[1:07:12] the prophet be known that the Lord truly
[1:07:14] sent him
[1:07:23] even so would I break the Yoke of
[1:07:25] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon from the
[1:07:27] neck of all the nations within the space
[1:07:29] of two full years
[1:07:30] and the Prophet Jeremiah won his way
[1:07:34] German I didn't fast
[1:07:35] German I didn't argue ananiah comes and
[1:07:38] prophesy it's something contrary to what
[1:07:40] the prophet says Jeremiah said amen
[1:07:43] so be it let the Lord perform the words
[1:07:46] that you've spoken because if what
[1:07:48] you're saying is a word of God then you
[1:07:49] come to pass my attitude as a Believer
[1:07:52] is amen so be it you said God is
[1:07:54] speaking so be it let us see God perform
[1:07:57] the words that you've spoken and
[1:07:59] Jeremiah went his way no fasting no
[1:08:01] arguing
[1:08:04] now
[1:08:05] then the word of the Lord came out to
[1:08:07] Jeremiah
[1:08:08] after ananiah the prophet had broken the
[1:08:10] Yoke from off the neck of the Prophet
[1:08:11] Jeremiah saying go tell him
[1:08:13] saying that serve the Lord
[1:08:19] that was broken yolks of wood but that
[1:08:21] shall make for them yolks of iron for
[1:08:23] thus if the Lord of hosts the god of
[1:08:25] Israel I put a yoke on iron upon the
[1:08:27] neck of all these nations that they may
[1:08:29] serve Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and
[1:08:31] they shall serve him and and I have
[1:08:33] given him the Beast of the field also
[1:08:35] then say the Prophet Jeremiah and
[1:08:38] hanania to the prophet here now ananya
[1:08:40] the Lord have not sent me but thou
[1:08:42] making these people to trust in their
[1:08:44] life therefore that saved the Lord
[1:08:46] behold I will cast it from off the face
[1:08:48] of the Earth this year that shall die
[1:08:51] because thou will start Rebellion
[1:08:52] against the Lord verse 17.
[1:08:55] so hananaya the prophet died the same
[1:08:58] year
[1:08:59] why the scripture ending that way to let
[1:09:01] you know that what Jeremiah said was of
[1:09:04] God
[1:09:05] what hananaya said wasn't of God
[1:09:07] Jeremiah didn't fight it he did not
[1:09:10] argue it he said so be it let the Lord
[1:09:12] perform what you said because Jeremiah
[1:09:14] is a prophet knows that the one
[1:09:16] characteristics of God is that
[1:09:17] everything he says come to pass
[1:09:19] so if a prophet use an anointing of God
[1:09:21] and he's speaking on behalf of God so be
[1:09:24] it let it happen Amen Let the Lord
[1:09:27] perform what you said but when God came
[1:09:29] and spoke to Jeremiah and said Dustin
[1:09:31] law you shall die the scripture ends
[1:09:33] ananiah died so who did God speak to
[1:09:36] the amen of God has a final say
[1:09:40] now this is very important because in
[1:09:42] numbers I think in Deuteronomy rather
[1:09:45] chapter 18 I believe verse 21-22 God
[1:09:48] tells the children of Israel this is how
[1:09:50] you shall know whether I've signed a
[1:09:52] prophet or not
[1:09:54] eat the things that he speaks come to
[1:09:57] pass I'm with him but if what he said
[1:10:00] doesn't come to pass the description
[1:10:01] don't be alarmed don't worry about it
[1:10:03] Jeremiah knows that he wasn't worried
[1:10:06] about it he wasn't alone by it if you're
[1:10:08] a Son of God the words that you speak
[1:10:10] will come to pass
[1:10:16] now Jeremiah's attitude was not to argue
[1:10:18] or dispute the prophecy
[1:10:20] but he said amen amen
[1:10:23] So eventually none of the things that
[1:10:25] hananaya prophesied came to pass
[1:10:27] but what Jeremiah said happened
[1:10:29] now as horrible as it is
[1:10:32] to speak Allah in the name of God which
[1:10:34] is what ananya did he said Lord and he
[1:10:37] was alive and he calls the people to
[1:10:39] believe in a lie
[1:10:40] as horrible that is it is equally
[1:10:43] horrible to take God's truth for a life
[1:10:48] it's one thing to speak a line in the
[1:10:50] name of God
[1:10:51] and it's another thing to take the truth
[1:10:52] or the word of God for a lie in other
[1:10:55] words doubting what God has said
[1:10:57] you're making God a liar
[1:11:01] right but I'm gonna go on and say this
[1:11:03] then the Israelites one settle there and
[1:11:06] what if they get to studying while I'm
[1:11:07] not worthy is talking about when they're
[1:11:09] in Goshen and to apply the blood you
[1:11:11] don't have to do nothing the only thing
[1:11:12] is to come under the shed blood that
[1:11:14] settles it once on the blood you're safe
[1:11:16] what if the deaf angel with his sword in
[1:11:18] his hand sweeping the land you didn't
[1:11:20] have to wander and to be scared was an
[1:11:23] insult to Jehovah
[1:11:27] if a man wants under the blood
[1:11:30] feels afraid
[1:11:31] that God won't keep his word it's an
[1:11:34] insult to him
[1:11:37] and you say Jehovah perhaps
[1:11:40] this is your word
[1:11:42] but I don't know whether it's right or
[1:11:43] not I think about the prophet God is
[1:11:45] saying
[1:11:46] one you under the blood
[1:11:49] you cannot take God at his word it's an
[1:11:51] insult to Jehovah
[1:11:54] when you're looking at your
[1:11:55] circumstances and you're weighing them
[1:11:57] against the promises of God and your
[1:11:59] circumstances way more than the promises
[1:12:02] of God it's an insult to Jehovah
[1:12:04] because you are a doubting that he's
[1:12:06] able to keep his word you're taking the
[1:12:09] truth of God's word for a lie
[1:12:11] because if you die you're saying you
[1:12:13] don't believe that he's able to bring
[1:12:15] you to pass therefore you don't believe
[1:12:16] that he can't keep his word you make him
[1:12:18] a liar
[1:12:25] the characteristics of God's word is
[1:12:27] that the things that he has declared
[1:12:29] must come to pass
[1:12:31] and if he doesn't come to pass it wasn't
[1:12:33] his word
[1:12:34] that's how you know it's the word of God
[1:12:36] if he comes to pass
[1:12:37] now God wouldn't allow a man to speak a
[1:12:40] lie in his name
[1:12:41] because that does great damages
[1:12:44] to his reputation
[1:12:47] you say his reputation
[1:12:49] a problem talks about this for the sake
[1:12:51] of time I'm not going to go through any
[1:12:52] details but it says that there's wanted
[1:12:55] to build a bridge in Sydney Australia
[1:12:57] and I wanted to find a great Builder
[1:13:01] they wanted the best builder
[1:13:03] and they decided to build this bridge
[1:13:04] across the Great Street of water
[1:13:06] and it came down to a renowned
[1:13:09] contractor who had a reputation behind
[1:13:11] him
[1:13:12] that he could do it
[1:13:14] it was expensive when the people didn't
[1:13:15] care because they wanted something of
[1:13:16] quality
[1:13:18] and but everyone says and I think every
[1:13:19] Christian ought to take the same
[1:13:20] attitude that's right we want to know
[1:13:22] where we're standing
[1:13:23] we don't want our Eternal destination
[1:13:25] built upon the shifting Sands of some
[1:13:27] church theology but on the Eternal Word
[1:13:29] of the Living God
[1:13:30] because remember every one of you
[1:13:32] sitting here tonight stormy time is
[1:13:34] going to hit that building that you're
[1:13:36] setting in tonight that's right death is
[1:13:38] going to strike it and you better know
[1:13:39] what kind of sin it's built upon or what
[1:13:41] kind of foundation it has God building
[1:13:44] the foundation will put nothing else but
[1:13:46] the best that there is because God is
[1:13:48] thoughtful of his reputation
[1:13:51] think about that statement God is
[1:13:54] thoughtful God cares about his
[1:13:56] reputation
[1:13:57] God cares about what people think about
[1:14:00] him
[1:14:01] so the reason why God gave that law to
[1:14:03] the children of Israel put him to death
[1:14:04] if somebody come to say that saved the
[1:14:06] Lord and it's not me kill him because
[1:14:09] they were damaging my reputation it's
[1:14:12] going to come to pass that when somebody
[1:14:13] says that said the Lord the people won't
[1:14:15] believe it
[1:14:17] because you'll think that God is not
[1:14:18] able to keep his word so let it be known
[1:14:20] that I keep my word I take my reputation
[1:14:23] seriously if anybody dares to speak in
[1:14:25] my name will I kill him
[1:14:28] God takes his reputation seriously
[1:14:33] now in Numbers Chapter 14 when the
[1:14:35] people rebel against Moses
[1:14:38] Moses and Aaron fell before the
[1:14:40] Tabernacle of the Lord and prayed and
[1:14:41] pleaded for the people
[1:14:43] and God comes to Moses
[1:14:45] and says
[1:14:47] it says unto Moses how long will this
[1:14:50] people provoke me
[1:14:51] and how long will it be until they
[1:14:54] believe me for all the sons which I've
[1:14:56] shown among them
[1:15:01] I will Smite them with pestilence and
[1:15:04] this disinter with them and will make
[1:15:06] thee a great nation and mightier than
[1:15:08] they and Moses said unto the Lord
[1:15:11] now listen the Egyptians shall hear it
[1:15:16] for thou brought us up these people in
[1:15:18] that might from among them
[1:15:20] the Egyptian saw your power they saw how
[1:15:23] you deliver these people
[1:15:24] if you kill them in the wilderness they
[1:15:26] will hear about it
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:29] and they will tell it to all the
[1:15:30] inhabitants of the land
[1:15:32] that they have heard that thou Lord are
[1:15:35] among his people that Lord you have been
[1:15:37] seen face to face and that clouds stand
[1:15:39] up over them and not go as before then
[1:15:41] by day in the field of cloud and in the
[1:15:43] period not by night now if Thou shalt
[1:15:46] kill all these people as one man than
[1:15:48] the Nations which have heard the fame
[1:15:51] your reputation which I've heard the
[1:15:54] theme of them will speak saying because
[1:15:56] the law was not able to bring his people
[1:15:59] into the land which is sure unto them
[1:16:01] therefore he have slain them in the
[1:16:03] wilderness
[1:16:06] and now I beseech they let the power of
[1:16:08] my law be great according as thou has
[1:16:10] spoken saying the Lord is suffering
[1:16:12] long-suffering and great of great Mercy
[1:16:14] pardon I besee the iniquity of your
[1:16:16] people and the law says I have pardon
[1:16:18] according to that word
[1:16:19] but as truly as I live all the years
[1:16:22] shall be filled with the glory of the
[1:16:23] Lord I love this this dialogue between
[1:16:25] God and Moses Moses priests before God
[1:16:28] and says Lord I understand you're angry
[1:16:31] I understand you're frustrated but be
[1:16:33] mindful of your reputation
[1:16:36] Nations have heard of what you're able
[1:16:38] to do they've seen your Mighty hand in
[1:16:40] Israel in Egypt never heard that there's
[1:16:42] a pill of fire in armies they're heard
[1:16:44] that is a pill of fighting armies and if
[1:16:46] you kill your people in the wilderness
[1:16:48] they will say oh their God was only able
[1:16:51] to take them this far he couldn't take
[1:16:53] them all the way and all the nations
[1:16:55] would start talking about it in other
[1:16:57] words this will be your new reputation
[1:16:58] that you are a God who can only go
[1:17:00] halfway that you cannot keep your word
[1:17:02] God say oh hold on I'll forgive them
[1:17:05] but as long as I live all the Earth
[1:17:07] shall be filled with my glory in other
[1:17:09] words I will not let any word that I
[1:17:11] speak fall to the ground I will not let
[1:17:13] my reputation suffer any damages
[1:17:15] regardless of the unbelief fine I will
[1:17:18] forgive them because my world is more
[1:17:20] important to me than the unbelief my
[1:17:23] Integrity is more important to me than
[1:17:25] putting up without belief I'll keep my
[1:17:28] word for the sake of my own reputation
[1:17:32] almost somebody intercept tonight like
[1:17:34] Moses and say Lord if you don't heal me
[1:17:36] the people that have testified at work
[1:17:38] saying that God Is A Healer they will
[1:17:41] hear about this they will hear away how
[1:17:43] you heal that person and that person but
[1:17:45] they'll say you're not able to heal me
[1:17:47] is this what you want your reputation to
[1:17:49] be Lord that you cannot heal my sickness
[1:17:53] God says wait a minute I will heal you
[1:17:56] I will heal you because as long as I
[1:17:58] leave all the Earth shall know my glory
[1:18:00] my words will come to pass my reputation
[1:18:03] will not suffer
[1:18:06] in Israel the Ark of God had a
[1:18:09] reputation as soon as the people of
[1:18:11] Israel brother Arc back all the nations
[1:18:12] around and fear God because they knew
[1:18:14] that the Ark in their midst meant that
[1:18:17] they're invisible
[1:18:18] then you're in the party of the Ark the
[1:18:20] power of God in their midst why because
[1:18:21] it took God years and years of building
[1:18:23] up a reputation
[1:18:26] what do you think throughout the church
[1:18:27] throughout all the Old Testament when
[1:18:29] God said sign the prophet they said that
[1:18:31] saved the Lord that saved the Lord
[1:18:33] that's the of the Lord that said the
[1:18:35] Lord God is making the Christ so clear
[1:18:37] this is this is me speaking
[1:18:39] and everything he speaks comes to pass
[1:18:42] everything he speaks comes to pass and
[1:18:45] it starts to build a reputation
[1:18:47] that everything that God speaks will
[1:18:49] happen and the people start building up
[1:18:51] confidence in the word of God because
[1:18:53] they know that God is able to keep it
[1:18:56] God is doing all of that to help your
[1:18:58] faith
[1:18:59] to help you believe because if you can
[1:19:02] only get you to believe what did the
[1:19:03] angel of the Lord said to brother
[1:19:04] Branham if you can get the people to
[1:19:07] believe
[1:19:08] the issue is not the word it's all
[1:19:09] powerful it's omnipotent the issue is
[1:19:12] our faith God Son of prophet with a gift
[1:19:14] to help them believe God put gifts in
[1:19:17] the church to help you believe God put
[1:19:19] minutes on the pulpit to help you
[1:19:21] believe so that you can get your faith
[1:19:23] right on the word of God that all things
[1:19:25] are possible to you if you can believe
[1:19:28] what am I doing tonight by preaching the
[1:19:30] word helping you believe
[1:19:32] that's the sister who came to prayer
[1:19:33] line but everyone was praying for a
[1:19:35] brother and another brother and sister
[1:19:36] came he says you don't have to be
[1:19:37] nervous it's okay it's a nervous spirit
[1:19:39] and it's all over the congregation how
[1:19:41] many have a nervous period people raise
[1:19:42] their hand so I'm just trying to tell
[1:19:43] you that God is here he knows all about
[1:19:45] you and I believe you're going to be
[1:19:47] healed as they said it says frankly I'd
[1:19:48] like to pray for you because you're not
[1:19:50] healed
[1:19:51] what happened he said that shadow has
[1:19:53] left you he didn't lay hands on her he
[1:19:55] didn't pray for her he was speaking to
[1:19:57] her but he got her faith he helped her
[1:20:00] faith and once her faith reached that
[1:20:02] level that it met the requirements of
[1:20:04] God that Spirit left on its own
[1:20:08] because somebody battling in his Spirit
[1:20:09] tonight I select your faith rise up and
[1:20:12] let your heart declare Lord be unto me
[1:20:14] according to the words to speaking and
[1:20:17] as sure as God is God I don't have to
[1:20:20] lay hands on you I don't have to cast
[1:20:21] that demand from you it will live on its
[1:20:24] own
[1:20:25] because you meet the requirements of God
[1:20:29] [Music]
[1:20:31] how many have

[1:20:46] out the form how many know what I'm

[1:20:57] put your last name you put your phone
[1:20:58] number you put your email and all of a
[1:20:59] sudden that button you couldn't click on
[1:21:01] it before it's not activated you cannot
[1:21:04] click on it it's not accessible to you
[1:21:06] why because you met requirements
[1:21:08] it's not up to you to choose what you
[1:21:10] want to leave the page or you want to go
[1:21:12] next
[1:21:13] that option wasn't there before you
[1:21:15] couldn't do anything before but when the
[1:21:17] requirements are met it's not up to you
[1:21:20] to choose do I want to go on or do I
[1:21:22] want to leave this webpage
[1:21:24] there's the promises of God and the
[1:21:26] power of God has to lose to the church
[1:21:27] but that's not accessible to you until
[1:21:29] you meet the requirements what are the
[1:21:32] requirements face when you come to a
[1:21:34] point where you met the requirements by
[1:21:35] believing in the word of God it's not
[1:21:37] accessible to you in other words it's up
[1:21:40] to you what you want to do
[1:21:42] you can stay in a wheelchair or you can
[1:21:44] get up and walk
[1:21:45] you can stay blind or you can get up and
[1:21:47] see you can keep that arthritis in your
[1:21:50] body or you can stretch your hand and be
[1:21:51] whole
[1:21:51] it's up to you because once you met the
[1:21:54] requirements of God the power is loose
[1:21:56] unto you
[1:22:08] Isaiah 46 11 here I've spoken it I will
[1:22:11] bring it to pass Jeremiah 4 28 because
[1:22:13] I've spoken it I purpose it I will not
[1:22:15] repent I will not turn my back on it
[1:22:17] Ezekiel 5 13 they shall know that the
[1:22:20] Lord have spoken it Ezekiel 5 15 add the
[1:22:22] Lord have spoken it Ezekiel 17 24 I had
[1:22:25] the Lord have spoken it and I've done it
[1:22:26] many personal scriptures I the Lord have
[1:22:28] spoken it I have done it I've spoken it
[1:22:30] as God wants you to know he's the one
[1:22:32] doing the speaking and if this is the
[1:22:34] one doing the speaking he will bring it
[1:22:35] to pass
[1:22:37] I'm going to close with this
[1:22:41] so we talked about Brahman says if you
[1:22:43] can only say it on your mind what this
[1:22:44] is and who spokeless
[1:22:46] and we spoke about who spoke this the
[1:22:48] amen of God he's the one who spoke in
[1:22:50] this let's talk about what this is what
[1:22:53] this word is
[1:22:55] when Moses goes down into Egypt he goes
[1:22:58] speaking things into existence
[1:22:59] right the place he calls the Flies and
[1:23:03] all the different things that happen in
[1:23:04] Egypt
[1:23:05] the prophet of God I don't know whether
[1:23:07] Moses realized it or not at the time
[1:23:09] that what was actually happening was
[1:23:10] created Power but the prophet of God in
[1:23:11] this age tells us that creative power
[1:23:13] came out of his mouth
[1:23:16] he says
[1:23:18] if he didn't speak the word into
[1:23:20] existence where did he get the material
[1:23:22] to make it out where did it come from
[1:23:24] sure he did he spoke it in existence
[1:23:26] because it's the word of God the very
[1:23:29] dirt and things that you're setting on
[1:23:31] today is the creative word of God
[1:23:35] the word of God Is Creative power
[1:23:39] so when Moses comes out of Egypt and God
[1:23:41] begins to deal with him to write the
[1:23:43] five books of the Bible Genesis to
[1:23:45] Deuteronomy and God gives him a front
[1:23:47] row seat at that kind of creation
[1:23:49] we know he's a prophet and now Moses
[1:23:52] starts to see how God
[1:23:54] from the words the heavens and the Earth
[1:23:56] and this this is why bless me this is
[1:23:58] pretty powerful to me to see this
[1:24:00] because when God Appears to Moses in the
[1:24:02] people of fire in Exodus chapter three
[1:24:03] once it doesn't know much of his God
[1:24:06] what do you heard from his parents
[1:24:08] as Brother Thompson said on Sunday he
[1:24:10] only had some knowledge of it but he
[1:24:12] didn't know him
[1:24:14] but he knew Egyptians God right because
[1:24:16] he was raised pagan
[1:24:18] so when God Appears to Moses Moses is
[1:24:20] having an encounter with God and he's
[1:24:22] trying to realize oh this is the god
[1:24:23] that I heard about and he's he's the
[1:24:25] pill of Fire
[1:24:27] he said this is the god that we heard
[1:24:28] about
[1:24:29] he's the god of Abraham and asking Jacob
[1:24:31] his name is I am Moses began to be
[1:24:34] acquainted with this God
[1:24:35] and as God uses Moses to deliver the
[1:24:38] people God is unfolding more of himself
[1:24:40] to Moses and to the people
[1:24:42] so when Moses spoke does fly and they
[1:24:44] came Moses like wow this girl is
[1:24:46] powerful
[1:24:47] wow
[1:24:48] he can bring flies like that Moses
[1:24:51] through his his rod and turned into a
[1:24:52] snake wow this God is powerful
[1:24:55] these are the things that he's able to
[1:24:56] do Moses struck the water and turn into
[1:24:58] blood wow and Moses is starting to
[1:25:00] experience the power of God
[1:25:03] now God tells Moses to come I'm going to
[1:25:05] show you creation
[1:25:08] now Moses starts to write
[1:25:11] in the beginning
[1:25:15] God said let there be light and there
[1:25:19] was
[1:25:20] Moses is watching God's creative power
[1:25:25] at work now this God of us mysterious is
[1:25:28] not revealing something special to Moses
[1:25:30] oh my it's not revealing to Moses The
[1:25:33] Secret of my power is in my word
[1:25:38] I'm catching it catch it he's not
[1:25:40] revealing to Moses I'm the all-powerful
[1:25:42] God you've seen me do these things in
[1:25:44] Egypt you saw what I'm able to do but
[1:25:46] now let me show you I'm going to reveal
[1:25:48] to you where all my power Lays
[1:25:51] it was a mystery to you before it was a
[1:25:53] mystery to the children of Israel before
[1:25:54] they only knew that I was a powerful God
[1:25:57] they knew that I was able to do this and
[1:25:58] that but now I'm going to show you how
[1:26:00] I'm able to do these things Moses the
[1:26:03] power or the secret of my power is my
[1:26:06] word
[1:26:07] when I say something it comes to pass
[1:26:10] and Moses is there watching he's like oh
[1:26:12] my God is the secret of his power the
[1:26:16] thing that makes this God unlike every
[1:26:18] other God is his word the kingdom makes
[1:26:21] him above all the other gods is his word
[1:26:23] the reason why he's able to do this fix
[1:26:26] is his word
[1:26:28] and then he says wait a minute that
[1:26:30] means that when I spoke in Egypt it was
[1:26:33] his word
[1:26:34] oh my God I began to point out this from
[1:26:36] the team to think that Moses coming to
[1:26:38] that realization wait a minute when I
[1:26:40] spoke in Egypt that means that was his
[1:26:43] word
[1:26:44] the same creative word that created
[1:26:46] heaven on Earth was the same words that
[1:26:49] he put in my mouth
[1:26:50] and when I speak the word I spoke God's
[1:26:53] thoughts he is stressing me with the
[1:26:56] secret of his power
[1:26:59] I feel like shouting but not even enough
[1:27:02] what's left in me The Secret of his
[1:27:04] power is his word
[1:27:05] if somebody can catch it tonight
[1:27:09] like Samson they knew what his power
[1:27:11] could do he's able to kill this field of
[1:27:14] sins he's able to do that he's going to
[1:27:16] carry a gate the line of Samson tell me
[1:27:19] the secret of your power
[1:27:21] see they knew what Samsung could do but
[1:27:23] I didn't know what the secret was and
[1:27:25] the secret of something was his hair and
[1:27:27] Samsung revealed it to the wrong person
[1:27:28] and here God is revealing to Moses what
[1:27:31] makes me almighty God what makes me
[1:27:34] all-powerful what sets me aside from all
[1:27:37] the other gods Wife puts me in a
[1:27:39] complete different category than all
[1:27:41] your Idols of Egypt is my word thank you
[1:27:44] The Secret of my power is in my world
[1:27:47] Moses write it in the Bible say in the
[1:27:50] beginning God said
[1:27:52] so that the people will know that my
[1:27:54] word is power
[1:27:57] you may not grasp it but there's one
[1:27:58] person who understands it really well
[1:28:00] it's the devil
[1:28:02] he knows all too well the power of God
[1:28:05] is in his word
[1:28:06] why do you think every Church any
[1:28:08] attacks the word
[1:28:10] because the source of power
[1:28:11] that's why the prophet of God says that
[1:28:13] the Holy Ghost was bound throughout the
[1:28:15] church ages by Chris and dogmas
[1:28:18] right because the devil attacked the
[1:28:20] word and by mixing the word with men's
[1:28:23] Christians and dogmas he rendered it of
[1:28:25] non-effect in other words he removes the
[1:28:27] power out of it by God's not a prophet
[1:28:30] in this last days to Aristotle work to
[1:28:33] you why because in the restoration of
[1:28:35] the word is the resurrection of power
[1:28:39] you'll think this message is Doctrine no
[1:28:42] sir you say this message is just
[1:28:44] baptizing right no sir you think this
[1:28:47] message is addressed God
[1:28:49] a code of conduct
[1:28:51] a compilation of scriptures and good
[1:28:53] testimonies now
[1:28:55] the message of the hour is the secret of
[1:28:58] God's power restored to the church which
[1:29:01] is the word which is the seven Thunders
[1:29:03] which is the opening of the seals which
[1:29:05] is a shot at midnight that's your body
[1:29:07] change that's your rapture that's your
[1:29:09] healing that's your deliverance it's the
[1:29:12] word
[1:29:14] if I don't want to get you to believe in
[1:29:16] the world they'll be everybody here at
[1:29:18] Hill tonight

[1:43:01] about certain things that he'd spoken to
[1:43:03] me
[1:43:03] and I wasn't sure
[1:43:05] whether those things would come to pass
[1:43:07] because of choices I made in my life
[1:43:09] and I came here when everybody left and
[1:43:11] I prayed at this altar
[1:43:13] and I said Lord
[1:43:15] I failed you miserably but these are the
[1:43:17] things you've spoken to me
[1:43:19] please
[1:43:21] what will happen to those things that
[1:43:23] you've spoken about not that I didn't

[1:43:38] not alter them
[1:43:39] my Covenant with you will like it I've
[1:43:43] held on to those words all these years
[1:43:45] because I know he met me here I know and
[1:43:49] he told me that the words that came out
[1:43:51] of his mouth he would not alter them
[1:43:53] because of what I did he will not change
[1:43:55] them because of my decision he said my
[1:43:57] Covenant with you will I keep because I

[1:44:20] Hallelujah Lord Jesus
[1:44:24] Lord how can we close Lord at the
[1:44:26] moments like this where you brought your
[1:44:27] word forth Lord where you brought your
[1:44:29] people to a place Lord where they can
[1:44:31] just claim Lord Lord it feels like even
[1:44:33] at this moment Anything Could Happen
[1:44:35] Lord you don't bring Lord a word to your
[1:44:37] servant you don't bring your people to
[1:44:39] this place not just to drop off and let
[1:44:42] us walk out a door so Lord we want you
[1:44:44] to still stir and move here in this
[1:44:46] service Lord we're not going to Lord
[1:44:47] dismiss in prayer and just walk out a
[1:44:49] door but Lord would you still move
[1:44:51] tonight don't you you've brought us to a
[1:44:54] place Lord somebody maybe just needs to
[1:44:56] sit and allow that word now to stir Lord
[1:44:59] to where maybe in their heart they're
[1:45:00] saying amen but Lord their mouth needs
[1:45:03] to now confess that you are indeed the
[1:45:05] Amen in their situation oh God so Lord

[1:45:19] move oh God may we have this sensitivity
[1:45:22] Lord if you're Spirit Lord within has
[1:45:24] not not to disrupt not to move away but
[1:45:27] Lord just to start to enter in at this
[1:45:29] very moment when you're dealing with
[1:45:31] your people oh God maybe tonight would
[1:45:33] be one of those all-night prayer meeting
[1:45:35] type of nights when Lord you're moving
[1:45:37] in the midst of your people and we can
[1:45:39] just be shut in with God in his secret
[1:45:42] place Lord whatever you're speaking
[1:45:44] whatever you're dealing whatever you're
[1:45:46] bringing somebody to a certain place
[1:45:48] where Lord the answer that you've been
[1:45:50] speaking to them is now going to come to
[1:45:52] manifestation because their heart is
[1:45:55] screamed out Amen to the word of God so
[1:45:58] Lord we pray tonight you just move with
[1:46:00] us Lord deal with the Lord is if someone
[1:46:03] must leave it so be it but Lord we stay
[1:46:05] in your presence tonight as we say Amen
[1:46:08] to the word of God and now let it bring
[1:46:11] forth May that creative power that Moses
[1:46:14] experienced by watching you by Vision
[1:46:16] take the Earth and start to form may it
[1:46:19] form in the in the bodies of your people
[1:46:21] oh God we pray in Jesus Christ name go
[1:46:25] with your people Lord as we now just

[1:46:32] amen
[1:46:37] foreign
[1:46:43] I wish I knew what to do at this very
[1:46:44] moment
[1:46:46] maybe I could say something else I could
[1:46:47] help you
[1:46:49] but the quote that we read in the
[1:46:50] beginning
[1:46:52] I lie not when I say that I've not been
[1:46:54] able to escape from it
[1:46:56] it's the Holy Ghost was emphasizing to
[1:46:58] me that this was tonight what he wanted
[1:47:00] to tell the church
[1:47:02] if you can only settle in your mind what
[1:47:05] this word is and who spoke this word
[1:47:07] there's no reason why you should walk
[1:47:09] away the same
[1:47:11] I don't know about you but I just happen
[1:47:12] to believe the prophet I believe what he
[1:47:15] says because I know it's not his words
[1:47:16] the thoughts of God's spoken through a
[1:47:18] man it's Immortal power coming through
[1:47:20] moral lips the same happened tonight the
[1:47:23] thoughts of God creating power coming
[1:47:24] through moral leaps if you can settle in
[1:47:27] your mind that the person I spoke to you
[1:47:28] is not your brother beyond the pulpit
[1:47:29] it's almighty God how dare you go back
[1:47:32] on the same
[1:47:34] let me challenge you how dare you go
[1:47:36] back home to sin
[1:47:37] take all his word tonight there's no
[1:47:39] reason why you need to go back home with
[1:47:41] that same sickness if you can only
[1:47:43] settle in your mind who spoke this word
[1:47:46] and what this word is
[1:47:48] May the attitude of your soul be amen
[1:47:52] being unto me Lord
[1:47:54] feel free to do as the Lord as the Lord
[1:47:56] and spirit leads you God bless you
