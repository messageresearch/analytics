[0:32] says, "You're not a worshshiper."
[0:34] A worshipper goes there to worship,
[0:36] speaking of going to church, to express
[0:39] himself before his God, to praise God
[0:43] for his goodness, to every word, he
[0:45] hangs on to it.
[0:48] It says by a look, a gesture, especially
[0:53] by language, to declare, to utter, to
[0:57] tell.
[0:59] So, as we're gathered here together to
[1:00] worship,
[1:02] I'd like you to express yourself to God.
[1:07] If if you've had a bad week, and it
[1:09] happens to all of us,
[1:11] &gt;&gt; lift up your hands,
[1:13] &gt;&gt; straighten your knees and your back
[1:16] &gt;&gt; and express yourself to God this
[1:18] morning. Amen. There's a song I want to
[1:20] start, and I know Sister Linda doesn't
[1:22] like me when I sing it, but I uh cuz
[1:26] it's a difficult song, but maybe we can
[1:28] stand and sing it. I want to sing the
[1:30] verses, too.
[1:33] And if you know it, you can sing with
[1:34] me. If you don't, you can listen. This
[1:37] words of this song says, "How can I say
[1:39] thanks for the things that you've done
[1:42] for me?
[1:43] Things so undeserved,
[1:46] yet you gave to prove your love to me."
[1:48] The voices of a million angels could not
[1:51] express my gratitude. Amen. If you're
[1:54] grateful for what God has done for you
[1:56] this morning, you lift your voice,
[1:59] express yourself this morning, and tell
[2:01] God how much you appreciate him, how
[2:03] much you love him, how much you're
[2:05] thankful for what he's done for you.
[2:07] Amen. We'll sing it together.
[2:13] How can I say thanks
[2:18] for the things
[2:21] you have done for me
[2:28] so undeserved
[2:31] yet
[2:34] to prove your love for me.
[2:38] The voices
[2:41] of a million angels
[2:44] could not express
[2:47] my gratitude.
[2:51] All that I am and ever hope to be.
[2:57] I will

[24:20] Man, I was in Israel.
[24:22] It's a week ago
[24:25] and I had Don't ask me how I get, you
[24:27] know, it just said, "Hey, you want to go
[24:30] to IDF headquarters? I'd love to." Next
[24:32] thing I know, I'm meeting with one of
[24:34] the top generals in the army and at IDF
[24:36] headquarters. And I started thinking and
[24:37] we talked to him about one of the
[24:40] problems they have in Israel right now.
[24:41] And how many know Israel types the
[24:43] church?
[24:44] &gt;&gt; There's two kinds of Jews in Israel.
[24:47] There's secular Jews and there's
[24:49] believers. And the secular Jews have no
[24:52] said the problem they have is they're
[24:53] losing their attachment to the land.
[24:55] Hey, and there's a bunch of people
[24:57] walking around here in this world that
[24:59] say they're Christians, but they got no
[25:01] attachment to the to my home. Amen.
[25:05] Amen.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Now, there's some people that have
[25:07] attachment to the land, right? And these
[25:10] people are believers. And
[25:14] when I first saw them over there, it
[25:16] blew my mind cuz I thought I was looking
[25:19] at you guys.
[25:21] I saw 25, 30,000 people walking through
[25:24] the streets of Jerusalem and they had
[25:26] long dresses on.
[25:29] The sis, the women, the women, they had
[25:31] long dresses. I It's like I'm looking at
[25:33] the church. I had I had uh one of the
[25:35] fellas, we went over to this place for
[25:37] Shabbat, Cindy and I, last year. He said
[25:39] told his wife, he says, "You're going to
[25:41] love Cindy and Rod." He says, "They're
[25:43] just like us."
[25:45] He says, "She doesn't wear pants."
[25:49] And they don't have a TV in her house,
[25:53] right?
[25:55] And
[25:57] we're in a fight, saints. We are in a
[26:00] fight. And I tell you, when you walk
[26:02] into the IDF headquarters, I mean, they
[26:06] don't let anybody in there, you know?
[26:08] You got to get checked out, see if
[26:10] you're on the right side.
[26:12] And you go in there and you got to go
[26:14] through, you can't just drive in. You
[26:17] got to go through. You got to say,
[26:18] "Okay, here's my identification. Here's
[26:20] who I am." And they check you out. Okay.
[26:24] You got an appointment with a senior
[26:25] guy. We'll let you through there. You
[26:26] know the right people. And and then
[26:28] there's people walking around with I
[26:30] mean, you know, if you made one false
[26:32] move, you're gone, right? Cuz
[26:35] everybody's carrying weapons all over
[26:37] the place. The other thing, too, is they
[26:40] have that's where they have bunkers way
[26:42] down underground. You know, I thought,
[26:44] you know, the word says, "Thy word have
[26:46] I hid." It's down deep,
[26:50] &gt;&gt; right? And when you got the word hid
[26:51] down deep, Satan come against you, but
[26:54] he ain't getting in to the bunkers,
[26:56] right?
[26:57] I'm thankful. You look around, we see
[26:59] the signs of the time. It's getting
[27:01] close to the end, saints. They're
[27:03] talking about another war over there.
[27:05] Sy, you know, they just dumped a big
[27:07] bomb on one of the nuclear reactors that
[27:09] Syria had going and uh you know, not you
[27:12] don't hear about it. You just know, oh,
[27:13] there's something happened over there,
[27:15] right? There's a war going on. You might
[27:17] not hear about all the battles, but we
[27:19] want to be prayed up. Amen. We want to
[27:22] be pressing in. Amen. because our in
[27:25] fact I
[27:27] you know when I I talk to these people
[27:29] over there and I just have such a
[27:31] wonderful time cuz we talk about the
[27:34] word
[27:35] and I had I had this Jewish fellow said
[27:38] you know there's a scripture in the Old
[27:40] Testament
[27:42] said the prophet said he'd restore the
[27:44] hearts of the children back to the
[27:46] fathers.
[27:48] This is a Jewish man. He's not a
[27:49] Christian. He said I believe that is a
[27:51] scripture for our day.
[27:57] And where are we saints?
[28:00] Israel is recognizing where they are
[28:02] sitting in the scriptures. And we know
[28:04] where we are.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; We're going home soon. Praise God.

[30:22] Brother Tony, brother Tony, why don't
[30:25] you just come up and give a greeting to
[30:27] the people?
[30:41] God bless you.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Well, we uh certainly are thankful for
[30:48] God's keeping power. You know, as we
[30:50] sing the song signs of the times, we are
[30:53] recognizing what uh day and hour we're
[30:56] living in. And we also know that uh the
[30:58] word of God is uh has got to go into
[31:01] certain areas. And so, as you know,
[31:03] we've been overseas now just about four
[31:05] months to the day. We just got home last
[31:07] night and uh we uh have uh some unique
[31:12] uh testimonies of God's keeping power. I
[31:14] think some of you might have heard from
[31:16] uh Micah a little bit of what had taken
[31:19] place over there, but we areh going to
[31:21] share a little bit more maybe later on
[31:23] about how, you know, you sometimes find
[31:25] yourself and just an innocent situation
[31:26] where you're just feeling led to go and
[31:28] and the enemy might come in like a flood
[31:30] as it were, but God gives us peace in
[31:32] the midst of it all, doesn't he? And uh
[31:34] so we uh we're very thankful for all
[31:37] that uh we have been able to experience
[31:40] and speaking the word. We were in in
[31:42] Saudi Arabia and been able to minister
[31:44] the word there and share what God was
[31:46] doing in these last days. Different ones
[31:49] were expressing a great desire and open
[31:52] door to take the word into even uh Egypt
[31:54] and uh some possibilities there. We were
[31:58] in the country of Syria three times. who
[32:00] were in Jordan about three times as well
[32:02] and Lebanon a number of times and then
[32:04] also up in uh in Turkey where uh this
[32:07] brother Tarkin has been very very
[32:11] interested in what God is doing in these
[32:13] last days. And I believe that uh we can
[32:15] see from the message of the hour, you
[32:17] know, how late the hour is and what uh
[32:20] is called for in these last days. And so
[32:22] we just wanted to step out in faith and
[32:24] be used of God in a way that we felt he
[32:27] was leading us into. And so, uh, we're
[32:29] thankful for each and every one of you
[32:31] that remembered us in prayer. You're
[32:33] you're an extension of what the word of
[32:34] God is as it goes forward, right? I
[32:37] mean, one sws, one waters, God gets the
[32:39] increase. And it takes a body of uh of
[32:42] Christ to be able to send those out into
[32:44] these parts of the world. And so, we
[32:46] know that many of you wouldn't be able
[32:48] to go there. It's a difficult situation
[32:50] to be in some of these places. But, uh,
[32:53] God has laid a burden on our hearts, and
[32:55] we're just very thankful for that. We
[32:57] want to bring you greetings as well from
[32:58] the believers in Marople, Ukraine. We
[33:02] were with uh sister Natasha and her
[33:04] husband Merced in Jordan. And uh they
[33:07] she has family there in Ukraine and that
[33:10] was how she became a believer. Her
[33:12] family had gotten saved and sent her
[33:13] material when she was living in Jordan
[33:15] with her husband. And they also the
[33:16] whole church of Marople wants to send
[33:18] their greetings to you, brother Ed. And
[33:20] uh they're uh also I know brother
[33:22] Vladimir is asking for meetings there
[33:24] with brother Ed. So maybe who knows
[33:26] he'll be there in Ukraine sometime. We
[33:29] uh we also were with brother Ger Rovald
[33:31] and so brother Gird and the entire
[33:33] assembly there. They all send their love
[33:35] and greetings to you. We were with uh
[33:38] brother Gustaf and Noise uh on Wednesday
[33:42] and had a meeting with him and of course
[33:43] they send their love and greetings.
[33:44] Brother Malcolm Wana was just coming in
[33:46] for special uh uh meetings this weekend.
[33:49] It's Pentecost and so uh we just uh were
[33:52] able to connect with him just as we're
[33:54] leaving. he was coming in. And so,
[33:55] greetings from New Zealand as well. And
[33:57] of course, uh uh all the different ones
[34:00] there that uh have been here, they want
[34:02] to send their love and greetings as
[34:03] well. But we're here to hear the word.
[34:04] So, I just want to get out of the way
[34:05] and say God bless you and thank you.
[34:07] We'll shake your hands afterwards.
[34:17] Well, this is Mother's Day and uh uh
[34:20] while not everyone is a mother, but we
[34:22] all have had a mother.
[34:24] That's one thing. We all have this in
[34:26] common. We all have a mother and we're
[34:29] thankful for mothers. and all of you
[34:31] that are mothers that are here today, we
[34:34] want to give you honor and uh a special
[34:38] thanks for the part you have played in
[34:43] bringing your children. Uh I thank my
[34:47] wife for she doesn't let me give her a
[34:50] mother's day card because she reminds me
[34:53] I'm not your mother.
[34:56] But so I don't give her mother's day
[34:58] cards. I let my children do that. But I
[35:01] thank her for being a mother. Otherwise,
[35:03] I wouldn't have a family. So, we're so
[35:06] thankful and God bless our mothers
[35:08] today. And like brother Brandham said,
[35:10] we don't want to just remember that on
[35:12] one day.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; We want to be remembering our mothers
[35:15] all the time,
[35:16] &gt;&gt; every day of the year. And for those of
[35:18] you that have your mothers, you want to
[35:21] be thankful for that. And uh I can say
[35:24] that uh it it's really amazing. I don't
[35:27] want to take a lot of time with this but
[35:30] uh it's amazing. I I lost my mother when
[35:32] I was 6 and a half and my sister an here
[35:36] she was 11 and uh so we spent most of
[35:40] our life without our real mother. We had
[35:43] a stepmother uh and uh we thank God for
[35:46] her but we didn't have our mother. I
[35:50] probably missed my mother more in the
[35:52] last five years of my life than I missed
[35:55] her in all the rest of my life. It that
[35:58] you might not understand that but the
[36:00] memories be are so acute and so so much
[36:04] uh fondness and uh you just miss them
[36:08] and and then you wish you know I wish
[36:10] you could have seen my children. I wish
[36:12] you could have seen my grandchildren. I
[36:14] her great grandchildren. You know you
[36:16] just have those thoughts and that's only
[36:18] natural. But one day we have a promise
[36:21] right here.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what a glorious salvation she
[36:26] had. And and that's one of my memories I
[36:30] remember about her the salvation and joy
[36:33] she walked in.
[36:35] Uh, brother Rod has made the
[36:37] announcement, but I'll just re-emphasize
[36:39] that uh, next Sunday the 18th, which is
[36:42] the long weekend for Canada, and the
[36:45] following Sunday, which is the 25th of
[36:48] the Memorial Day on the US side, we'll
[36:50] just be having one service here in the
[36:52] church. Uh, for those of you crossing
[36:54] the borders or having anything to do
[36:56] with the borders, it's it's become
[36:57] almost a nightmare even on any day of
[37:00] the week. And so, uh, on those Sundays,
[37:03] we're just going to have one service,
[37:05] and it'll be the regular time that we
[37:07] have, uh, this next Wednesday, uh,
[37:10] Brother Jason Watkins, who is, uh,
[37:13] Sister Lisa St. John's brother, and
[37:15] we're well acquainted with Brother Jason
[37:17] for and have been for many years, he
[37:20] will be speaking here next Wednesday,
[37:22] and, uh, he's with Brother Tim Dodd
[37:24] today in in Grand Prairie, and I'm sure
[37:27] they'll be having a wonderful weekend.
[37:30] So that's this coming Wednesday.
[37:33] Uh
[37:35] we have a special announcement regarding
[37:38] uh the camp. I would like to I would
[37:40] like to just set the dates for the camp
[37:42] in case you are not aware of it. But our
[37:47] our family camp uh begins in August. Uh
[37:51] the junior camp is the August 4th, 5th,
[37:54] and 6th. And then we go into the senior
[37:57] camp. But the senior camp is the family
[37:59] camp. That is where we put the tent up
[38:03] and all the people come. And I can tell
[38:05] you that this is going to be a very very
[38:07] special year, the Lord willing. Very
[38:11] special year. uh and so that will take
[38:14] place on the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th
[38:20] will be those and those days uh will
[38:23] brother Ron Spencer is going to be the
[38:27] uh speaker. Now this is very very
[38:29] special. Very special. Uh and I as you
[38:34] know at the time when we were just
[38:36] purchasing the camp, brother Ron Spencer
[38:40] was in that explosion, that accident and
[38:43] engulfed in flames and burnt very very
[38:46] badly. He was unconscious
[38:49] in in the hospital in the ICU and they
[38:54] did not know from day to day whether he
[38:56] would live. And one day sitting at my
[38:59] study in my desk, I became so burdened
[39:03] for his wife, Sister Connie, because
[39:06] also their son was burned in trying to
[39:08] retrieve him out of the fire. And uh and
[39:12] as they were running, his father fell
[39:15] and he had to go back and kind of get
[39:18] him to help him out and try and get him
[39:20] out of the flames.
[39:22] Uh and I phoned a a cell number that I
[39:26] had. I'm sorry. I phoned their phone
[39:29] number, their home number, realizing
[39:33] that
[39:35] she's not going to be home. Nobody's
[39:36] going to be home. But I just felt I had
[39:38] it was the only number I had. and I felt
[39:40] I needed to contact her and uh when the
[39:45] home phone rang, she picked it up
[39:49] and I said, "Sister Connie, where are
[39:52] you?" She said, cuz I said, "I've called
[39:55] your home." She said, "I'm in the car
[39:58] driving between hospitals. I've just
[40:01] left my son and I'm on my way to the my
[40:04] husband." and and she said uh
[40:09] I'm I'm said and I have the line the
[40:12] telephone from home forwarded to my cell
[40:15] and I said I've called you because I'm
[40:18] burdened for you. I said you your your
[40:21] son is in the hospital. Your husband is
[40:25] in the ICU and I I'd like to know just
[40:29] how things are. And she told me that he
[40:32] was still unconscious. And I said, I
[40:34] feel directed of God. I said, I'm told
[40:38] by the medical science and medical
[40:41] people and doctors that of all the
[40:43] senses that we have of our body, the
[40:47] hearing is the and you've heard me say
[40:49] it here before, the hearing is the last
[40:51] one that a person has or the that a
[40:54] person loses. And I said, ' And I have
[40:57] spoken to other people and told them,
[41:00] you read the scripture, you put on that
[41:04] prophet's voice, you speak to them, uh
[41:08] sing them songs of Zion that you know
[41:11] they're familiar with and let them hear
[41:14] even if you're not getting any response.
[41:17] And I said, "We have just bought a camp.
[41:20] At least we are closing on this camp
[41:22] ground. I want you to go to brother Ron.
[41:27] I want you to say to him and his air.
[41:30] Brother Biscll is sending a message.
[41:33] They have purchased a camp and you're
[41:35] going to preach in that camp.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; And she went to the hospital and gave
[41:40] him that message. And he's going to
[41:43] preach in this camp.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; I give God all the glory.
[41:52] Hallelujah.
[41:54] And I saw him 30 days after this. I saw
[41:58] him standing in brother uh brother
[42:04] Dan Daisley's church when he had just
[42:06] passed away and and I was moving up to
[42:10] view at the casket
[42:13] and there was a a man right in front of
[42:15] me and he turned around and I could
[42:18] scarcely recognize he looked so
[42:21] youthful. His face was so bright, looked
[42:25] like he had baby skin. It was Ron
[42:27] Spencer.
[42:29] I couldn't believe. And that's why I
[42:31] came back and showed you the picture of
[42:32] him laying in the hospital right on the
[42:35] very brink of death. And 30 days later,
[42:38] couldn't even tell he had been in a
[42:40] fire.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, God's God's a
[42:44] supernatural God.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; And when when we asked him to come, he
[42:48] just agreed right like that. And I told
[42:50] him, "This is going to be a special
[42:51] dedication, this camp. I I just feel it.
[42:54] I've been feeling it for weeks.
[42:57] and we're going to have the Lord
[42:58] willing. In fact is they became so
[43:01] enthused I said uh your father and
[43:03] mother have never been here and I met
[43:05] his father in 1978 and he's a pastor
[43:09] never been here. I said I want your
[43:11] father and mother to come. I want them
[43:13] and I want Sister Conniey's mother and
[43:15] father because he's a pastor and I want
[43:18] them to come. Brother Ron's mom has
[43:20] never been on a plane. I said I don't
[43:22] care if she's ever been on a plane. you
[43:24] get her on the plane and and get her
[43:26] here and and and and the and then his
[43:29] son is coming, his son and his wife and
[43:32] his other son and his wife. And I said,
[43:34] "Well, praise the Lord. Praise the
[43:36] Lord." The more I said, "Praise the
[43:37] Lord," the more they're coming.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; So, the last I heard, there's 13 of them
[43:41] coming. So, we're going to open up our
[43:43] homes and and not only welcome them, but
[43:46] anyone else who comes. So I'll say to
[43:49] you seniors that plan to get in the
[43:51] camp, the soon as a registration, when
[43:54] is the registration? Not yet. Well, I
[43:57] don't want the office to be flooded. But
[43:59] the soon as registration is offered, you
[44:02] want to get your name in very very quick
[44:04] because otherwise it's going to be same
[44:07] old story, no no room in the end.
[44:10] And you don't want to hear that, do we?
[44:13] So make sure that you get your name in.
[44:16] But in order to do that, we got one
[44:19] final push. Is that right, brother
[44:22] Chris?
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Randy. Where's Brother Randy?
[44:27] At least they tell me it's one final
[44:28] push. There he is. So, here's the two
[44:31] brothers that's responsible.
[44:33] And I want to give a bouquet.
[44:36] Brother Chris has spent the last six
[44:38] months
[44:39] almost most almost almost all of the
[44:42] last six months gets up early and goes
[44:45] to the camp and has been giving it uh
[44:48] been giving it his personal attention
[44:51] and he just has given himself to it. We
[44:54] had two things that needed to be done
[44:57] and one was all of the septic systems
[44:59] etc. and you've heard about that. So, I
[45:02] won't go into detail, but brother Chris
[45:05] has been just overseeing the the
[45:08] operation there and to bring it up to
[45:11] where we would want it to be and need it
[45:14] to be. And brother Randy who's in who's
[45:17] actually inspector of uh of fire systems
[45:20] for Watcom County and Scadget County and
[45:23] down in Phoenix and all over. He's been
[45:26] working between Phoenix and Seattle and
[45:30] Bellingham and the camp and and then
[45:33] when these brothers are all done, they
[45:36] have some time for home and their wives.
[45:38] And I I I've kind of avoided their wives
[45:41] a wee bit because we've gobbled them up
[45:44] so much. But uh so you sisters, I know
[45:47] that Sister Cigarette and Sister Lori
[45:49] will forgive me. But we have one last
[45:51] push and we need we need some specific
[45:54] help. Uh we need uh uh I took brother uh
[45:59] brother John Lelay and his two sons,
[46:00] brother Joseph and brother James. And
[46:03] those three brothers, they're all
[46:04] carpenters and they're real tradesmen.
[46:07] And they came out there. I said, "We
[46:09] need this this extension." At least
[46:10] Brother Randy says, "We've got to have
[46:12] this extension to the chapel to put
[46:15] washrooms. There's no washrooms in the
[46:17] chapel. And we're going to and and we
[46:20] don't even need a building permit
[46:21] because we're we're getting it in under
[46:23] the fire prevention because the fire
[46:25] sprinkler system has to come in here. We
[46:27] need a place to put the pipe. So, we'll
[46:30] build a whole washroom to put the pipe.
[46:32] I said, "That sounds like a good plan.
[46:35] Doesn't that sound fine?" And uh and so,
[46:38] Brother Ry's arranged this. And of
[46:40] course, we you know, we we've got quite
[46:43] an advantage because he's one of us to
[46:45] sign the papers. So, he sees the
[46:47] blueprint and he signs the papers and
[46:49] passes it. Uh, I I think that's, you
[46:52] know, I don't know. That's the way I
[46:55] like to do things.
[46:57] You kind of have an inside track.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; So, we appreciate these brothers. But
[47:01] we're needing
[47:03] for the 16th and 17th. That's a Friday
[47:07] and Saturday. And that's the Canadian
[47:08] long weekend.
[47:10] And also the 23rd and 24th, which is the
[47:13] Memorial Day long weekend on the US
[47:15] side. We need uh uh those skilled
[47:19] tradesmen and those of you that are
[47:20] framers and carpenters and whatever
[47:22] more. And I've got the names of of of of
[47:26] a number here and I'm going to call
[47:28] these names out so there's no mistake.
[47:30] Is that all right, brother Chris? That's
[47:32] exactly what you want. I got an email
[47:34] from this brother at 5:53 this morning.
[47:39] I was sleeping, but he was not.
[47:42] And uh we would like to see these
[47:44] brothers. Is this all right? We We've
[47:46] got a little time. All right. Uh,
[47:48] Brother Jeff Walman, we need you. Joel
[47:52] Ray, we need you.
[47:56] Uh, if you got to go to work, well,
[47:58] maybe you can get sick enough to go to
[47:59] the camp and we'll we'll fix you up
[48:02] there. Uh, Brother Tim Perkins and
[48:05] Justin Perkins and Bob Stall. Brother
[48:08] Bob, you're such a good worker. You work
[48:10] so hard and so good and so competent.
[48:13] They say they can't operate without you.
[48:15] Joseph Lei, James Lei, John Lei. I know
[48:19] they will all be there. And brother
[48:21] Chedimeir,
[48:22] and uh Brother Dragmare. Now, you've
[48:25] been away in Yugoslavia or Slovenia or
[48:29] Bosnia and just got back. Isn't that
[48:32] wonderful? Just in time.
[48:35] And we welcome you back with a
[48:37] invitation to be at the camp. But those
[48:40] brothers we really need and all others
[48:42] who might uh uh have some skills along
[48:46] these way. We can use quite a number of
[48:48] others, can't we? And I think some
[48:50] sisters, we don't have a chef. He's gone
[48:52] on vacation. So, we need some sisters.
[48:54] And I think maybe sister Karen
[48:56] Hendrickson, she just got her uh uh her
[48:59] she got passed as a official food
[49:03] person, food in the food service
[49:06] industry, and that's necessary. So,
[49:08] we're real glad and I'm sure uh that
[49:11] you'll be kept busy as well.
[49:17] Amen.
[49:19] One last thing. Any brothers going from
[49:21] Canada to the state side, do not cross
[49:24] the border at the Sumass crossing.
[49:26] That's what the American officials have
[49:28] told us. The American officials have
[49:31] told us, "Do not cross at the Sumass
[49:34] crossing, but cross at the Peace Arch
[49:36] and the truck crossing. Those are the
[49:39] crossings where they've made
[49:40] arrangements and you can go down to the
[49:43] camp and and God bless you."
[49:47] So, I give special thanks to these
[49:49] brothers that have worked so hard,
[49:50] Brother Chris and Brother Randy. God
[49:52] bless you. Uh, can I take a moment for a
[49:56] wonderful testimony?
[49:58] We just prayed this last week for sister
[50:01] Debbie Coral. That's brother Wayne's
[50:04] sister-in-law
[50:05] and uh brother brother Perry. Uh I spoke
[50:10] with him day before yesterday and spoke
[50:12] with him this morning.
[50:14] Uh he gave me you know we we hear a
[50:17] little bit about uh uh the situation.
[50:19] Sister Debbie was giving birth to a
[50:21] child and uh almost bled to death. In
[50:25] fact is
[50:27] her doctor told brother Perry that she
[50:30] had at the most one hour to live.
[50:34] So that's just how how serious it was.
[50:38] Brother Perry told me,
[50:42] he said, "I uh about two to three weeks
[50:46] before my wife was to have child, he
[50:49] said, I I began to just have such a a
[50:54] desire." And he said, "My thoughts went
[50:57] to your testimony that you gave when you
[51:00] were with brother Brandham." And he
[51:02] said, "You were in the car and the angel
[51:05] of the Lord, that presence, Brother
[51:07] Brandham asked you a question. Do you
[51:09] what about this ministry? Do you believe
[51:10] it could be that of Elijah the prophet?"
[51:13] And he said, "And you look back." Now,
[51:15] Brother Perry is speaking this ex these
[51:18] are his words. And he said, "You look
[51:20] down to the glove box." That's my exact
[51:22] words.
[51:23] And you made some that you believed it
[51:26] was or it must be. He says, "And then
[51:28] that presence of the of God, that very
[51:32] angel of the Lord came right between
[51:34] you." And I said, "That's exactly
[51:36] right." He said, "That came to my mind."
[51:39] And he said, "And and he said, you have
[51:42] a wonderful uh site." Uh, and there's a
[51:45] clip on there of that, just that clip.
[51:48] And that is the site uh, Believe the
[51:51] Sign. And if you haven't seen it, you
[51:54] need to get on that site. Believe the
[51:56] sign. and he didn't know how it came
[51:58] about. And I said, "Brother Jeremy
[52:00] Bergen, who's a chartered accountant,
[52:03] took six weeks, I'm six months, rather,
[52:07] six months off of his work and took a
[52:10] sabbatical
[52:12] and he is so fidious and so accurate and
[52:15] so precise. He put that site together."
[52:18] He said, and Perry said, "That's a a
[52:20] wonderful site. It's an excellent site."
[52:22] And that clip is on that site. He said,
[52:25] "And brother Biscll, I played it and I
[52:28] played it and I played it and that
[52:30] presence of God that you spoke of became
[52:35] such a reality to me." He said, "I
[52:38] played it probably 20 times."
[52:42] And then he said, "I said to Debbie, sit
[52:45] sit down. I want you to hear this." And
[52:49] he said it was the night she had to go
[52:51] to the hospital. And of course, I guess
[52:53] they wouldn't have known that. and he
[52:55] had her sit down and he says and we
[52:57] played that clip again and he said we
[53:00] probably played it for another five or
[53:02] six times
[53:04] and he said he said I was so gripped
[53:07] with the presence of God. He says, "And
[53:10] then that night she had to go to the
[53:11] hospital. Next morning she's laying at
[53:14] the point of death." He said, "Brother
[53:16] Bisco, when I went into the hospital,"
[53:18] he said, "I couldn't recognize her.
[53:20] Could hardly recognize her. She had
[53:23] changed in such." And he says, "And I I
[53:26] demanded that her doctor come in." Said,
[53:29] "I'm sorry. Uh, her doctor is off
[53:32] today."
[53:33] He said, "You have to get get her here."
[53:37] and her doctor came in. And when they
[53:39] saw that situation, he gave her an MRI
[53:42] and gave her an emergency operation. And
[53:45] and he said within within just hours,
[53:47] she's laying on a ventilator, can't
[53:49] breathe herself, and laying right at the
[53:52] point of death. He didn't even know how
[53:54] serious. But the doctor told him, he
[53:56] said, "What we're afraid of, she's lost
[53:57] so much blood that her organs are going
[54:00] to start shutting down."
[54:02] And uh and this was their concern. When
[54:06] I spoke to him just day before
[54:07] yesterday, she was still on the
[54:09] ventilator. Actually, yesterday it was
[54:11] on a ventilator. And he says they've
[54:13] taken a blood test. They said that the
[54:15] blood
[54:17] uh they gave her this operation. And
[54:19] when she's laying in that state, Brother
[54:22] Perry's at her bedside
[54:25] and her mother and dad and the medical
[54:28] team.
[54:34] He said, "I thought about that clip.
[54:37] I thought about that presence." And I
[54:40] said to the doctors, I said, "Excuse me,
[54:43] I'd like you to leave.
[54:45] All the medical staff, I'd like you to
[54:47] leave." He said, "We're Christians and I
[54:51] want to pray."
[54:53] And he said, "They left."
[54:56] And just Brother Perry and her mother
[54:58] and dad. He said, "I began to pray and
[55:02] began to relate to God
[55:05] about the presence
[55:08] and and the things that were said and
[55:11] call on him to come." He said, "Brother
[55:14] Biscll, the presence of God came in that
[55:16] room so mightily." He said, "Came in
[55:19] that room so mightily." He said, "It was
[55:21] just like I knew that it was over." And
[55:24] I said, you know, Brother Brandham said
[55:25] that in his presence, the supernatural
[55:28] is happening. And all I can tell you
[55:31] this morning, as of this morning, within
[55:33] just hours, the ventilator's gone. They
[55:36] had the heart specialist in. He said,
[55:37] "Her heart is so strong that she just is
[55:41] back to normal as far as the heart's
[55:42] concerned." They called in the kidney
[55:45] specialist, and the kidney specialist
[55:47] told him what a serious situation. And
[55:49] he said she just had such an enormous
[55:51] amount of fluid and water in her body.
[55:54] And he said it didn't seem possible. He
[55:57] said her kidneys are operating 100%.
[56:01] Those were his words. And I say to God
[56:04] be the glory. Great things he has done.
[56:09] [Music]
[56:16] You know I I get feeling that you have
[56:18] to forgive me.
[56:22] These things are real.
[56:24] I got down in my study. And I said,
[56:28] "Lord, it was you that came into that
[56:32] car.
[56:33] It was a being. It was a person. It was
[56:36] a being."
[56:37] &gt;&gt; And I froze. I thought if I take one
[56:40] breath,
[56:41] if I take one more breath, I'm going to
[56:43] pass into some other realm. I've never
[56:46] It's not a blessing. It's not a It's not
[56:48] some light frivolous thing. I thought
[56:51] that I was passing away from this world.
[56:54] I have never never experienced anything
[56:56] even remotely like it. I've had people
[56:58] come up and say, "Oh, brother Biscll, I
[57:00] know exactly what it was. I had that one
[57:02] time." I
[57:04] say, "You've never had anything like
[57:05] this." and sitting beside and brother
[57:08] Brandham's face just turned ashen and he
[57:11] turned to me just slightly brother Eddie
[57:15] I guess he's come to me 10,000 times
[57:18] 10,000
[57:19] and it's every time it's the same it's
[57:21] just like I could die
[57:24] he'd said another time he said it's like
[57:26] a heavy current going through a very
[57:30] thin wire see these bodies they're not
[57:33] really made for that but we the presence
[57:36] of God could turn on with such intensity
[57:38] right here that you'd be afraid to
[57:39] breathe.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; That's our God.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; He's a holy God.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; He's a righteous God.
[57:47] And I got down my knees and I said,
[57:50] "Lord,
[57:52] when you came into the car that day, it
[57:55] was already in your mind that a boy on
[57:59] down the road,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; a young man on down the road,
[58:03] &gt;&gt; you're going to bring this to his mind
[58:05] &gt;&gt; and he's going to get a hunger for that
[58:07] and he's going to want to hear it." And
[58:10] so you did it for him
[58:11] &gt;&gt; and you did it for sister Debbie and you
[58:14] did it that they would come into your
[58:15] presence and have an answer to this
[58:18] prayer. And I asked if I may give this
[58:20] testimony and he said by all means and
[58:22] to give thanks to brother Jeremy Bergen
[58:24] for putting that site on. Believe the
[58:26] sign. Brother Jeremy, if you didn't do
[58:28] it for any other purpose than this one,
[58:31] it was worth it all.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Would you stand with me
[58:38] and we'll pray. Heavenly Father, we're
[58:40] going to turn to your word right now,
[58:42] but we've heard so many times that that
[58:44] any human with strength can turn the
[58:46] pages of the Bible. But it takes
[58:49] almighty God by the Holy Spirit to
[58:51] reveal its contents. And because you are
[58:54] the author, I pray that you as the
[58:56] author will come and give interpretation
[58:59] and give meaning and give substance to
[59:01] it. We are here today, oh God, to give
[59:03] you thanks for everything that you have
[59:05] done. every time that you've spoken or
[59:07] appeared to us or or given something at
[59:10] a personal level. For all of these that
[59:12] are here within the sanctuary and
[59:14] throughout this building in the
[59:16] fellowship room and wherever they may be
[59:18] and those that are internet connected to
[59:21] us with live streaming today, I pray
[59:24] that they will be sensing the same
[59:25] atmosphere and the same presence and the
[59:28] same lovely warmth of our Lord Jesus
[59:31] Christ in the place where they are. And
[59:34] now, oh God, take human lips, I pray,
[59:37] and human hearts that they may receive
[59:39] your word in the name of Jesus Christ,
[59:42] receive, I pray, our thanksgiving to
[59:45] you. And we pray that you'll bless our
[59:47] mothers, oh God. We pray that you will
[59:50] bless them and give them the desires of
[59:52] their heart. I'm sure that many of them
[59:54] are praying for their children and
[59:56] praying for their spouses and praying
[59:59] for their families. Oh God, I pray, oh
[1:00:01] God, you'll bless them with a answer to
[1:00:04] their prayers and grant them the desires
[1:00:06] I ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'd like you to
[1:00:12] turn in your Bibles, please, to Romans,
[1:00:14] the 12th chapter. We have uh three
[1:00:17] readings, but they're all brief.
[1:00:32] The 12th chapter of Romans, verses 1 and
[1:00:35] 2. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
[1:00:39] the mercies of God, that you present
[1:00:41] your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[1:00:44] acceptable unto God, which is your
[1:00:47] reasonable service. and be not conformed
[1:00:51] to this world, but be ye transformed by
[1:00:55] the renewing of your mind, that you may
[1:00:58] prove what is that good and acceptable
[1:01:01] and perfect will of God. Notice, and be
[1:01:05] not conformed to the world, to this
[1:01:08] world, but be ye transformed by the
[1:01:12] renewing of your mind, that you might
[1:01:15] prove what is that good and acceptable
[1:01:18] and perfect will of God. And we're all
[1:01:21] we're all interested in the perfect will
[1:01:23] of God. In the eighth chapter of Romans,
[1:01:26] turn back a page or two, the 29th verse,
[1:01:29] which is part of our scripture reading
[1:01:31] from last Sunday.
[1:01:34] For whom he did forno,
[1:01:37] he also did predestinate
[1:01:40] to be conformed. And I'd like you to be
[1:01:43] mindful that this conformed is a
[1:01:46] different word in the Greek than the
[1:01:48] conformed that we just read in Romans 12
[1:01:50] and two. To be not conformed. Now this
[1:01:53] one is to be conformed and they're two
[1:01:56] completely different words which I'll
[1:01:57] just touch on in a moment. For whom he
[1:02:00] did forno he also did predestinate to be
[1:02:03] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:02:06] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:02:09] brethren. And then if you can turn to
[1:02:11] Hebrews the 8th chapter
[1:02:14] the 10th verse
[1:02:18] of ro of Hebrews 8 and 10.
[1:02:22] For this is the covenant that I will
[1:02:25] make with the house of Israel after
[1:02:27] those days, say the Lord. I will put my
[1:02:31] laws into their mind and write them on
[1:02:35] in their hearts, and I will be to them a
[1:02:37] God, and they shall be to me a people.
[1:02:40] That's God's doing, is it not?
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your
[1:02:44] seats.
[1:02:49] Paul has said, "And be not conformed to
[1:02:52] this world." I'm just going to be brief
[1:02:54] on on this point so you grasp it
[1:02:56] quickly, please. Be not conformed. And
[1:02:59] this is to conform oneself.
[1:03:04] We can never make oursel We can never
[1:03:07] conform ourselves and make ourselves
[1:03:09] acceptable to God. That's virtually
[1:03:12] impossible. So that is be not conformed
[1:03:15] to this world. That is to be don't be
[1:03:18] fashioned after this world. Don't don't
[1:03:22] change yourself because uh because that
[1:03:25] is something you can do. You can just
[1:03:27] fashion yourselves according to the
[1:03:28] world. So don't fashion yourself after
[1:03:31] this world. But when the apostle Paul
[1:03:34] said that in in Romans the 8th chapter
[1:03:37] 29th verse to be conformed to the image
[1:03:40] of his son that is to be fashioned like
[1:03:43] unto be fashioned like him or having the
[1:03:47] same form as another be conformed to the
[1:03:51] image of Jesus Christ describes and this
[1:03:55] describes what is the essence of the
[1:03:57] character and the very substance and
[1:04:00] thus the complete
[1:04:02] be conformed to the image of his son.
[1:04:04] That has reference to something that is
[1:04:07] durable. Something that is lasting and
[1:04:11] not merely an outline.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; This is in substance. This is an
[1:04:16] essence. This is in character. Be
[1:04:18] conformed to the image of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:21] And then when God said, "I will put my
[1:04:24] laws into their mind, and I will write
[1:04:27] them in their hearts, and I will be to
[1:04:29] them a God, and they shall be to me a
[1:04:31] people." He said, "I will put my laws."
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; It's not saying, "Do you want my laws?"
[1:04:37] He said that whom he forneew, he
[1:04:40] predestinated,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; he predetermined that they will be
[1:04:44] conformed to the image of his son. I'm
[1:04:49] I'm interested in something. And I I am
[1:04:52] going to be short on time this morning.
[1:04:53] So I I need to bring you up right to uh
[1:04:57] my thought.
[1:04:59] We know from the scripture, we know from
[1:05:01] the message in particular
[1:05:04] that a a word that is spoken is a
[1:05:07] thought expressed.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; So now there is God had thoughts. This
[1:05:12] great supreme being had thoughts. And
[1:05:16] because he's God, he's all knowing. He
[1:05:19] cannot learn anything as such. So he
[1:05:22] knew all those that are his. Jesus said,
[1:05:24] "My sheep hear my voice." That's very
[1:05:27] specific. My sheep hear my voice. And
[1:05:30] furthermore, another they will not
[1:05:32] follow.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; I began thinking this great supreme
[1:05:37] being that uh in in the Greek they refer
[1:05:40] to the word the word as the logos. And I
[1:05:44] was interested in how that developed and
[1:05:46] how that evolved down. But I I I tried
[1:05:49] to go back and to think on this point.
[1:05:54] God who had these thoughts
[1:05:57] thought of you and thought of me thought
[1:05:59] of this service. He had all these things
[1:06:02] in his mind.
[1:06:04] He this word was his thoughts first. Now
[1:06:09] how did he convey what was in his mind?
[1:06:13] How did he convey that
[1:06:16] to me to you so that it had the same
[1:06:20] meaning as it was in his mind?
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; How does it translate down?
[1:06:28] Because as I thought about that, you
[1:06:31] know, words and the and the evolution of
[1:06:34] words and so someone speaks a word and I
[1:06:39] may say a board and someone may think oh
[1:06:43] the pulpit's a board or next person will
[1:06:47] think of a tree. So there's a there's a
[1:06:51] a difference of imagery that's that is
[1:06:55] comes to the the human mind
[1:06:59] when a word is spoken.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Today brother Rod talked about the the
[1:07:05] the Jews.
[1:07:07] Well they read from Genesis to Malachi
[1:07:12] and it has one image to them. They see
[1:07:16] something from those words which are
[1:07:19] written and the next person can hear the
[1:07:22] same words and have a different have a
[1:07:25] complete different understanding from
[1:07:27] the same words.
[1:07:30] And so then you wonder uh how do either
[1:07:34] of us know that we have God's
[1:07:36] understanding?
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; That's the question. And then Jesus
[1:07:40] asked Jesus spoke specific words. All
[1:07:44] kinds of people heard him. It meant one
[1:07:46] thing to the Pharisees. It meant
[1:07:48] something else to the Sadducees. It
[1:07:50] meant something else to the Zealots. It
[1:07:53] meant something else to the disciples.
[1:07:56] And even then, they weren't grasping in
[1:07:59] fully what he was speaking. So, I'm
[1:08:02] interested in knowing how God is going
[1:08:06] to transfer. I know now we know that it
[1:08:10] can't come just by knowledge. It can't
[1:08:12] come just by learning you know the words
[1:08:16] in the language whatever language we
[1:08:18] speak. So as soon as something is spoken
[1:08:22] then we have a certain thought we can
[1:08:24] say repent
[1:08:26] repent and be baptized and soon as
[1:08:29] someone hears that one person says well
[1:08:32] I did I was sorry and then I went over
[1:08:35] here and somebody sprinkled me. Is that
[1:08:38] what was in God's mind?
[1:08:40] That's the question. And the next person
[1:08:43] says, "Well, I went through a different
[1:08:45] exercise, but reading the same words.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Was this one sincere?" Absolutely. Was
[1:08:50] this one sincere? No doubt.
[1:08:53] Everybody's sincere. It has nothing to
[1:08:55] do with sincerity. Did God, was he able
[1:08:59] somehow to channel what he thought into
[1:09:02] your mind? And so that you then acted
[1:09:06] upon
[1:09:07] really what God had in his mind. And
[1:09:09] then when God saw what took place, he
[1:09:12] can say, "That's what I thought."
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; That was my thought.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that thought, then
[1:09:19] we certainly haven't got the perfect
[1:09:21] will of God.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Because he spoke and made known his will
[1:09:24] of God. So now I've got you maybe left
[1:09:26] out on a limb. I'm giving you
[1:09:29] essentially a summary of the of the
[1:09:31] message in a few minutes. I I can prove
[1:09:34] to you that the channel and the only
[1:09:36] channel and the secret of it is in
[1:09:38] Jesus' own words to Peter when he said
[1:09:41] to Peter, "Who do men say that I am?"
[1:09:45] Who do men say that I, the son of man,
[1:09:47] am? Well,
[1:09:49] some say, and they all heard him. Some
[1:09:52] say, "You're Jeremiah
[1:09:55] or Isaiah
[1:09:56] or one of the other prophets."
[1:09:59] Some even thought that he was John the
[1:10:01] Baptist raised from the dead
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; because there was a similarity of the
[1:10:06] spirit of Elijah which was on John and
[1:10:10] Jesus Christ who John for ran.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; So but who do you say I am?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Says thou art the Christ the son of the
[1:10:22] living God. Blessed art thou. You are
[1:10:26] especially blessed. You are in a unique
[1:10:30] group.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; You are an elected one.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Because flesh and blood, your mother,
[1:10:36] your father, your family has not
[1:10:39] revealed this to you. The the rabbi has
[1:10:42] not revealed this to you. No flesh has
[1:10:45] revealed this to you, including the
[1:10:47] flesh of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; It was not the flesh of Jesus Christ
[1:10:52] that revealed it to him. It wasn't
[1:10:54] Peter's flesh who learned it somehow.
[1:10:58] That's true.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou
[1:11:02] because flesh and blood hath not
[1:11:04] revealed this to you, but my father.
[1:11:07] He's revealed this to you. So we know
[1:11:10] now that the thought of God can only be
[1:11:13] conveyed by revelation.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; And revelation can be grossly and is
[1:11:21] grossly misunderstood. So the power of
[1:11:24] the spoken word,
[1:11:26] the power of the spoken word is the only
[1:11:28] thing that can transform
[1:11:31] us into sons and daughters of God. There
[1:11:34] is no other thing. You can't learn it.
[1:11:36] You can't read enough books and you
[1:11:38] can't hear enough tapes. You can't you
[1:11:41] can't do anything on your own that will
[1:11:43] give you that uh that can give you that
[1:11:46] transformation. But when you when you
[1:11:48] read the word of God and God reveals to
[1:11:52] you what that is and where it is and
[1:11:56] where your part is in it and when it's a
[1:11:59] revelation. Now I'm being very very
[1:12:01] honest.
[1:12:04] When I was done thinking and pondering
[1:12:06] and praying and
[1:12:08] seeking God earnestly, I've been giving
[1:12:10] giving myself uh some very very
[1:12:15] in-depth questions.
[1:12:17] And I'd urge you to because there isn't
[1:12:19] a person here that isn't going to pass
[1:12:21] on from this scene one way or another,
[1:12:24] either through a rapture and a body
[1:12:25] change
[1:12:27] or by way of death.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And then what? So I asked myself,
[1:12:35] when have you had a revelation?
[1:12:40] When have you when can you actually say
[1:12:43] that was revealed to me?
[1:12:50] I was brought up in a Christian home.
[1:12:54] I've heard thousands of services and
[1:12:56] preaching,
[1:12:59] but I can tell you that a revelation
[1:13:01] will brand you forever.
[1:13:05] Amen.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; And when I sat on a log
[1:13:10] looking into the eyes of a prophet of
[1:13:13] God with questions encumbering my soul
[1:13:17] and my mind as a young minister who' now
[1:13:21] been preaching for about seven years and
[1:13:24] I wondered I got some very dear friends
[1:13:27] that believe God is three persons. I
[1:13:30] have some very dear friends that believe
[1:13:32] God is one. I even had one I looked up
[1:13:36] to and esteemed and he said, "All I can
[1:13:38] see is two." And so I could fit myself
[1:13:42] in that place. Is he one? Is he two? Is
[1:13:46] he three? And here I am preaching to
[1:13:48] people and I can't even declare them,
[1:13:51] thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:13:57] And then I saw people
[1:14:00] with manifestations of all kinds speak
[1:14:03] in tongues and prophesy and have visions
[1:14:06] from God and say, "Thus sayaith the
[1:14:08] Lord." And then as time went on, it it
[1:14:11] it obviously wasn't thus sayith the Lord
[1:14:13] because it didn't happen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; You know, it's a very fearful thing,
[1:14:18] friends, to be standing where I'm
[1:14:20] standing behind this pulpit today.
[1:14:23] And I often wish I didn't have this
[1:14:25] responsibility
[1:14:27] because this is a solemn thing. You got
[1:14:29] a soul
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; and I wouldn't dare say anything that
[1:14:33] would misguide you or misdirect you. But
[1:14:36] I can tell you one thing.
[1:14:40] I said to this prophet of God, I said to
[1:14:44] brother Brandham,
[1:14:46] "How is it that people can be so
[1:14:48] anointed?" And I said, "And I know they
[1:14:49] are anointed. I know that. I I know what
[1:14:52] that anointing is. They're anointed and
[1:14:54] I hear them prophesy. I hear them speak
[1:14:56] in tongues. I hear all I've seen all
[1:14:58] kinds of manifestations. But the lives
[1:15:01] that are lived are not according to the
[1:15:04] word of God. That man opened up his
[1:15:06] mouth and gave me four scriptures. He
[1:15:09] didn't try to convince me about
[1:15:11] anything. Didn't speak about himself. He
[1:15:13] gave me four scriptures out of the
[1:15:15] Bible. The rain falls on the just and
[1:15:17] the unjust. The wheat and the tears
[1:15:19] enjoy the same sunshine, enjoy the same
[1:15:21] rain, and grow out of the same earth and
[1:15:24] have the same nutrients. And one is
[1:15:26] wrong, one is tears, and one is wheat.
[1:15:29] And by the time he went through those
[1:15:31] four, he even asked me, "What is the
[1:15:32] rain?" I said, "It's the Holy Spirit."
[1:15:34] And and the scripture says it falls on
[1:15:36] all. It falls on the just and the
[1:15:39] unjust.
[1:15:40] And I sat there and I said, "Why didn't
[1:15:43] I see this before?
[1:15:46] How come I could miss this?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you right at that moment,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; a flash of light
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; entered into my soul. And it's as real
[1:15:57] today as it was at that moment.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; And I said to God while I was studying
[1:16:02] this message. That's one time I know I
[1:16:05] had a revelation from God. And it has
[1:16:08] never changed. It's only increased in
[1:16:10] its intensity. It's only increased in
[1:16:12] its truth. And it might be a whole lot
[1:16:14] of things because people get excited.
[1:16:16] They get enthused and they think that's
[1:16:18] revelation. That's not rest revelation.
[1:16:21] A revelation might excite you. It might
[1:16:24] enthuse you, but that is not necessarily
[1:16:26] just getting inspired. That's not
[1:16:29] necessarily revelation. Or even getting
[1:16:31] anointed is not revelation. Revelation
[1:16:34] is the very mind of God that comes down
[1:16:38] into your soul and you know it without
[1:16:40] any question. And I can tell you, a
[1:16:42] revelation will never fade.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; A revelation will never get dull. A
[1:16:47] revelation will never allow you to go
[1:16:49] into the world and go into unbelief and
[1:16:51] sin. A revelation will remain constant.
[1:16:55] [Applause]
[1:17:01] That's mostly my message.
[1:17:05] Through faith, we understand.
[1:17:08] Now, in connection with that, I want you
[1:17:10] to think about
[1:17:12] the title to my message today is the
[1:17:14] power of the spoken word. Because I've
[1:17:17] taken seven weeks, seven services now on
[1:17:20] the heavenly bridegroom creates head
[1:17:25] bride.
[1:17:27] And that's the power of transformation.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Creative power. It can only come from
[1:17:34] one source and that's the word of God.
[1:17:37] But now my message is you can hear the
[1:17:39] word and the question is
[1:17:43] have you heard the word of God
[1:17:46] and if it is the word of God we can hear
[1:17:49] a word and it can mean different things
[1:17:50] to different people as I said earlier
[1:17:52] and I'm going to go into some depth in
[1:17:54] that
[1:17:56] and we can hear the word but how do we
[1:17:58] know that we have heard the word of God
[1:18:02] and that we have the very thought of God
[1:18:06] and God help people.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; I mean, I I'm preaching serious stuff.
[1:18:10] This is serious things because we do not
[1:18:13] want to flounder around. We don't want
[1:18:15] to continue on and just religion or or
[1:18:18] have a our a message brand. I see a lot
[1:18:21] of things in the message and I'm
[1:18:23] convinced it's not the thought of God.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; I see people act the way they act and
[1:18:28] perhaps dress the way they dress and
[1:18:30] they need the mind of Christ.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; They need some conviction. They need
[1:18:36] something to happen inside, something
[1:18:38] more. Or they can hear a preacher maybe
[1:18:40] preach, get behind the pullpit and lay
[1:18:42] some heavies on them and they make an
[1:18:44] adjustment and a change, but it hasn't
[1:18:46] been a revelation yet. You need a
[1:18:48] revelation in your own heart that this
[1:18:51] is the way I must live. This is the way
[1:18:53] I must conduct my home. This is the way
[1:18:56] I must conduct my life. This is the way
[1:18:58] I must conduct my business.
[1:19:00] It's not somebody pounding it over the
[1:19:03] over the over the pulpit. Not somebody
[1:19:06] laying a heavy on you. It's God
[1:19:09] transferring by revelation what's in his
[1:19:12] mind into your mind. So it brings the
[1:19:14] result of his thought.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; The Lord
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; through faith. The scripture says we
[1:19:24] understand that the worlds were framed
[1:19:27] by the word of God. The worlds were
[1:19:30] framed by the word of God. So that the
[1:19:33] things which are seen were made of
[1:19:35] things which do
[1:19:40] that the things were seen were not made
[1:19:42] of things which do appear.
[1:19:48] John wrote in Revelation
[1:19:51] 4 and 111, "Thou art worthy, oh Lord, to
[1:19:54] receive glory and honor and power, for
[1:19:57] thou hast created all things,
[1:20:00] and for thy pleasure they are and were
[1:20:04] created."
[1:20:07] In the Hebrew series,
[1:20:09] Brother Brandham refers to the logos. He
[1:20:11] said, "And incidentally, I have been
[1:20:13] reading
[1:20:15] what the world considers as some of
[1:20:17] their greatest and most illustrious
[1:20:19] philosophers
[1:20:21] to determine on their individual thought
[1:20:25] of what the logos was and how that word
[1:20:28] even developed to where it is today." So
[1:20:30] that I say logos, one person over here
[1:20:33] might say, "I haven't got a clue what
[1:20:34] that is." Next person, they have a
[1:20:36] different understanding. Someone else
[1:20:37] has a completely different different
[1:20:39] understanding. I'd like to know what
[1:20:41] these philosophers,
[1:20:44] great great philosophers, names that
[1:20:46] you'd recognize immediately.
[1:20:49] What did they think about the logos?
[1:20:57] And I found that they have said in brief
[1:21:03] that the word logos has a long history
[1:21:06] and evolution of the idea it embodies it
[1:21:10] is really the unfolding of man's
[1:21:13] conception
[1:21:15] of God.
[1:21:18] Dr. Scoffield in the Scoffield Bible
[1:21:20] when he speaks of Jehovah the Lord God
[1:21:25] how he is the
[1:21:27] self-existent one
[1:21:30] who continuously
[1:21:32] and increasingly
[1:21:35] reveals himself
[1:21:38] the self-existent one
[1:21:42] and as I read what these men and then
[1:21:44] some went and they they have said
[1:21:49] Every word implies a thought
[1:21:53] and it is impossible to imagine a time
[1:21:56] when God was without thought. Brother
[1:22:00] Brandham says and I have I'm going to be
[1:22:03] perfectly honest with you and very
[1:22:04] simple. I found that brother Brennham he
[1:22:07] gave an absolute profound
[1:22:10] profound
[1:22:12] he distilled the thought of these even
[1:22:14] great philosophers a man with a grade
[1:22:16] seven education gave the thought and
[1:22:18] distilled their thought into such
[1:22:21] concise and precise statements that it's
[1:22:24] just it's just absolutely divine
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; it going to be nothing but god
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; because on some of them they tended
[1:22:31] towards that the logos must be reason,
[1:22:36] the power of reason and reasoning. And
[1:22:39] then others as they took it and studied
[1:22:41] it, these great uh philosophers of the
[1:22:44] world said it must also be something if
[1:22:47] it is of reason, it has to have at some
[1:22:51] point an expression. It has to come to
[1:22:53] expression. And so it was finally
[1:22:56] determined that they must merge
[1:22:59] someplace.
[1:23:01] And here, brother Brown says it in just
[1:23:03] a few words.
[1:23:04] A thought, a word is a thought
[1:23:08] expressed. And that line actually is a
[1:23:13] it's a it's a consummation of even what
[1:23:15] these great philosophers I've read quite
[1:23:17] a bit about it. But it's absolutely
[1:23:19] amazing that a word is a thought
[1:23:24] expressed. But I take it on from there.
[1:23:26] You're familiar with that. You hear that
[1:23:28] all the time. But what I am concerned
[1:23:30] and interested about is that you hear a
[1:23:33] word, I hear a word, they hear a word,
[1:23:36] some other church hears the same word,
[1:23:39] reads the same scripture and comes up
[1:23:41] with completely different conclusion.
[1:23:48] So how do we know yours is right? How do
[1:23:49] we know mine's right? How do we know
[1:23:51] this one's right?
[1:23:54] And within the ranks of the message, one
[1:23:57] read one thing, they read this quote and
[1:23:59] bingo, they're in this direction, and
[1:24:01] someone else read exactly the same thing
[1:24:03] and mean something else to them. They
[1:24:04] both say, "I got a revelation." Excuse
[1:24:07] me, somebody ain't got a revelation.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; One of the two or maybe neither one have
[1:24:12] a revelation
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; because what is the revelation? And the
[1:24:15] revelation has to be nothing less than
[1:24:18] the thought that God had in his mind for
[1:24:22] this season. And he transfers it through
[1:24:26] the channel of revelation because
[1:24:28] there's no other way for him to do it.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou
[1:24:34] Simon Barjonah.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:24:38] you. Your father, a godly man, did not
[1:24:41] reveal this to you. your pastor, your
[1:24:44] priest, your synagogue, your rabbi,
[1:24:47] whoever it might be, the one that loves
[1:24:49] you so intensely did not reveal it to
[1:24:51] you. It has to come by a revelation from
[1:24:54] God. And a revelation will transform
[1:24:57] your life
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; because it is designed by God to conform
[1:25:02] you into the image of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; That word has has been invested with all
[1:25:11] the power
[1:25:13] That word has been invested with
[1:25:15] actually creative power. It will take
[1:25:18] and transform you into the image of
[1:25:21] Jesus Christ. It's not whether you will,
[1:25:24] he will to do it.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Said I will put my word.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Into their heart. I will put it in their
[1:25:32] mind.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Amen.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; So the logos, just listen to these few
[1:25:41] things now. The logos, this great
[1:25:44] fountain of spirit which had no
[1:25:47] beginning or no end. This great spirit
[1:25:50] began to form in the creation and the
[1:25:54] logos that went out from it was the son
[1:25:57] of God. It was the only visible form
[1:26:01] that the spirit had. And it was a
[1:26:04] theophony which means a body and the
[1:26:07] body was like a man.
[1:26:12] If I took and read for you
[1:26:17] some of the things
[1:26:25] that some of these people who the world
[1:26:26] regards as very great,
[1:26:32] very very recognized people.
[1:26:37] You'd think that
[1:26:39] uh they say, "Well, this logos must be
[1:26:43] the son of God.
[1:26:46] This logos must be theophony. This logos
[1:26:50] has the ability to appear." And they
[1:26:53] start going down the line and this
[1:26:55] paragraph I just read you, Brother
[1:26:57] Brandham, has summed the whole thing up.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:27:03] And then he said, "And it's the same
[1:27:05] type of body that we receive when we die
[1:27:09] here. If this earthly house, Apostle
[1:27:12] Paul said, if this earthly tabernacle be
[1:27:15] dissolved, we have one already waiting."
[1:27:19] That was it. He said, "And that was the
[1:27:21] theophony which was the son of God. That
[1:27:24] son, that logos became flesh because we
[1:27:28] were put in flesh. And the theophony,
[1:27:30] the logos, became flesh here among us.
[1:27:34] And it was nothing else but the dwelling
[1:27:36] place for that entire fountain dwelt in
[1:27:41] him. The fullness of the godhead bodily.
[1:27:45] The scripture says, now if this sounds a
[1:27:47] little heavy for you, just hang in here,
[1:27:49] will you?
[1:27:51] In the message attitude he says and
[1:27:53] there that great space where no one can
[1:27:57] fathom in their mind beyond that that
[1:28:00] space eternity that's Jehovah God
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; out there and we're taught in the
[1:28:06] beginning that the logos or the son of
[1:28:08] God went out of God and thus the
[1:28:11] scripture can say that all things were
[1:28:13] made by him. Well, we know that all
[1:28:15] things were made by God. But all things
[1:28:16] were made by by Christ because Christ
[1:28:20] was the creative force that went out
[1:28:22] from God by which God created all
[1:28:26] things. And because you were in a fallen
[1:28:29] state, he had to take a body of the
[1:28:31] earth like you have a body of the earth
[1:28:34] coming from your mother. And as I've
[1:28:36] been preaching on the last weeks, he
[1:28:38] took a body of the earth and and God God
[1:28:42] in Christ claimed the earth. He dropped
[1:28:44] his blood on the earth, claimed the
[1:28:47] earth. And when he dropped his blood on
[1:28:49] blood on it and claimed it, you and the
[1:28:52] elements of your body, the substance was
[1:28:55] laying here on the earth. You were
[1:28:57] laying here when Jesus died. You were
[1:29:00] laying here when the blood dropped upon
[1:29:02] it. You were laying here when God says,
[1:29:04] "I'm redeeming the earth." And when
[1:29:06] Jesus now coming and was baptized and
[1:29:10] the heavens opened and a dove descended
[1:29:12] and a voice, "This is my beloved son."
[1:29:16] And the prophet says, "That was his
[1:29:18] first part of the earth that he
[1:29:20] redeemed." And and and and then in the
[1:29:24] Old Testament, oh my, you just have to
[1:29:26] help me now. in the Old Testament when
[1:29:28] they when they planted their field,
[1:29:31] remember that everything here on earth
[1:29:33] is a reflection of of the heavenly. And
[1:29:36] so when when a a man planted his field
[1:29:39] and he received the first the first
[1:29:42] harvest, the the first mature grain of
[1:29:45] the harvest, he cut a sheath down and he
[1:29:48] took the sheath to the priest and the
[1:29:50] priest waved the sheath before God in
[1:29:53] thanksgiving. And the prophet says he
[1:29:56] waved it because there were more like
[1:29:58] that chief in the field.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ was the first born son
[1:30:05] of God.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; This is my son. He was cut down at
[1:30:11] Calvary. He was buried, but he raised
[1:30:14] again. The first chief to come to full
[1:30:18] maturity. And it was waved before God as
[1:30:21] a a as a memorial that there's more like
[1:30:25] me in the field. In the field. Yeah. And
[1:30:27] you were laying in the field. And God
[1:30:30] was giving testimony. There's more sons
[1:30:32] like me.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; There's more children like me. And
[1:30:36] they're laying in the field. And Jesus
[1:30:38] said, "The field is the world.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And you were laying here in the field
[1:30:42] when that happened. God testifying, I'm
[1:30:45] going to bring them."
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; And here you are today. Good.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Here you're seated today. And so now God
[1:30:52] with his children, he must transfer his
[1:30:55] thought to his children. How does he
[1:30:57] transferred? He can't do it through any
[1:30:59] educational system. Can't even do it
[1:31:01] through this church. Can't do it through
[1:31:03] any church. Can't do it through any
[1:31:04] minister. You can hear the words, but
[1:31:07] it's now God that has to send his spirit
[1:31:10] and cause a revelation of what that word
[1:31:13] has to mean to you. Hallelujah.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you
[1:31:20] if you receive it by revelation,
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; it'll have a transforming power attached
[1:31:26] to it.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:37] Now although the things
[1:31:40] were made by him, yet there was a
[1:31:43] preparation for the creative power to do
[1:31:45] its work. There isn't anyone here that
[1:31:48] would deny God has brought me here. God
[1:31:52] has given me life. I'm here breathing
[1:31:54] God's free air. I'm here because God has
[1:31:57] allowed my life to be here. That's
[1:31:59] exactly right. And now I can show you in
[1:32:02] the scripture which I will that
[1:32:05] there needs to be a something take place
[1:32:10] in preparation for the word to bring
[1:32:12] about its result.
[1:32:15] And the Bible says and God said let the
[1:32:19] waters
[1:32:20] under the heaven be gathered together
[1:32:23] unto one place and let the land let the
[1:32:26] dry land appear. And it was so. Why was
[1:32:30] that? Because in the ground there were
[1:32:33] seeds.
[1:32:34] Brother Brandham says in the ground
[1:32:36] there were seeds that were there. Let
[1:32:38] the let the dry land appear and the word
[1:32:41] of God was spoken and it happened. It
[1:32:43] had an effect on creation. Now we're
[1:32:46] saying if the word of God is preached
[1:32:49] over this pulpit or over any pulpit, if
[1:32:51] God's word for this season is preached,
[1:32:55] then there will be a preparation that
[1:32:57] takes place in the heart on the earth.
[1:33:00] The earth that's sitting in these pews
[1:33:02] today. There will be a a preparation
[1:33:05] because in there is a seed that must
[1:33:08] come forth. In there is a life that must
[1:33:11] manifest
[1:33:12] and the Holy Spirit broods over over us
[1:33:16] today
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; to cause that life to manifest
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; in the rising of the sun. He said, "And
[1:33:24] God had a reason to do that. For down
[1:33:26] beneath the water,
[1:33:29] there was seeds that had to be planted
[1:33:32] that had that he had planted and had to
[1:33:34] have the sunlight to make it to live."
[1:33:37] And the first light, the first light
[1:33:40] that was ever given in the earth was
[1:33:42] God's spoken word.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; That's the first light
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; that was ever spoken. So the word of God
[1:33:51] is the creative principle.
[1:33:54] By the word of the Lord, Psalm David
[1:33:57] said in the Psalms 33:6, "By the word of
[1:34:00] the Lord were the heavens made and all
[1:34:03] the host of them by the breath of his
[1:34:06] mouth." The word of God is also the
[1:34:09] instrument of his judgment. Because the
[1:34:12] scripture says through Hosea the
[1:34:13] prophet, "Therefore have I hewed them by
[1:34:16] my prophets, by the prophets. I've slain
[1:34:19] them by the words of my mouth. And thy
[1:34:22] judgments are as the light that goeth
[1:34:25] forth. So the word of God is a creative
[1:34:28] principle. The word of God is also the
[1:34:30] agent of judgment. And the word of God
[1:34:33] is also the agent of healing. For he
[1:34:35] spoke in the Old Testament also. He sent
[1:34:38] his word and healed them and delivered
[1:34:40] them from their destruction.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Do you think that word has diminished?
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Has it diminished? Is it as effective
[1:34:48] today? He sent his word and healed them.
[1:34:51] Do you know that in the preaching of the
[1:34:53] word today, you can lay hold by faith of
[1:34:56] the promise of God and said, "That's
[1:34:58] just as effective at this moment as I
[1:35:00] sit here in my physical need as it was
[1:35:03] when it was spoken because it's God's
[1:35:05] eternal word."
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; And he sent his word and healed them.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; So the word is the agent of judgment.
[1:35:14] The word is the agent of healing. The
[1:35:16] word is creative
[1:35:19] and transforms us into sons and
[1:35:21] daughters of God.
[1:35:25] I want you to think with me for a few
[1:35:27] moments on the thoughts of God
[1:35:32] and how
[1:35:36] words are developed
[1:35:39] to convey the thought so that we
[1:35:41] understand what the thought is.
[1:35:46] And I have said a moment ago, which I
[1:35:49] won't go into now, that
[1:35:53] God has uh he's got a means that he's
[1:35:56] got an ability. When when God said,
[1:36:00] "I will write my words in their heart. I
[1:36:02] will I will put them into their mind."
[1:36:06] That's just a very short sentence, very
[1:36:08] short phrase. How does he put it in his
[1:36:10] mind? And I've described for you from
[1:36:13] even from personal testimony
[1:36:19] that can only come through a channel and
[1:36:22] that channel is revelation.
[1:36:29] How does a word express a thought?
[1:36:33] How does it express a thought is my
[1:36:36] question.
[1:36:38] How is that word transmitted? How is it
[1:36:41] sent to you?
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; And how do we know that it's not a
[1:36:47] counterfeit revelation? And now I'm
[1:36:49] going to just refer to a couple of
[1:36:52] things I have I've experienced
[1:36:56] and I'll appreciate your real close
[1:36:58] attention. Now
[1:37:00] I have experienced where
[1:37:04] uh you know there are people in the
[1:37:06] world lots of people that are fed up of
[1:37:09] the government. Absolutely fed up of the
[1:37:12] government. They think that the
[1:37:14] government has made an absolute mess of
[1:37:16] things.
[1:37:19] And there are those that go to extremes
[1:37:22] along that line and they they become uh
[1:37:25] really anti-government
[1:37:27] and some become even active in movements
[1:37:30] that are anti-government and they feel
[1:37:33] that the government is deceptive and the
[1:37:37] government is stealing from the people
[1:37:40] and the government is corrupt and then
[1:37:43] they get in touch with the message and
[1:37:45] maybe they come to a message church and
[1:37:46] they hear and the brother takes a quote
[1:37:49] and says, "And this prophet has declared
[1:37:51] that every government's of the devil."
[1:37:53] He said, "Hey, I got a revelation." That
[1:37:56] is right. What he's really saying is, "I
[1:37:58] found somebody agrees with me."
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't get a revelation at all. He
[1:38:03] found somebody that agreed with him and
[1:38:05] and then you find someone else and let's
[1:38:07] say that he's a forgive me brothers but
[1:38:10] he's a doineering man and he he's got a
[1:38:13] real tight control on his wife and his
[1:38:16] family and tells his wife you go and do
[1:38:19] this do that come here go there get in
[1:38:21] the car do this the other thing you know
[1:38:22] what I mean tells her how to cook tells
[1:38:24] her how to do everything and uh and and
[1:38:27] they think that that's what the Bible
[1:38:29] teaches but that's not really what the
[1:38:31] Bible teaches is
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; the Bible teaches that you love your
[1:38:34] wife as your own body.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; So if you want to put, you know, tighten
[1:38:38] things down on her, you got to tighten
[1:38:39] things down on yourself.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Anyway, say like brother brother
[1:38:44] Garwalt. So there it is.
[1:38:48] But then they'll hear somebody say a
[1:38:49] quote, a minister will get up and make a
[1:38:51] quote and about women's places in the in
[1:38:54] in the kitchen and you'll hear that fell
[1:38:56] say, "Amen. My goodness. You mean a
[1:38:59] prophet said that? I got a revelation.
[1:39:02] No, they didn't get a revelation. They
[1:39:03] found somebody that agreed with them.
[1:39:06] They already had that in their heart.
[1:39:08] That's the kind of person they were. And
[1:39:10] they found now a doctrine and they says,
[1:39:12] "I got a revelation." And then they
[1:39:14] become part of your church and part of
[1:39:15] the congregation. And oh my, they're so
[1:39:18] fervent.
[1:39:20] My, this place is quiet.
[1:39:24] They're so fervent. You think you got
[1:39:26] the best member in the world? No. And
[1:39:28] finally it fades out. It fades away. Do
[1:39:31] you know why it fades away? Because it
[1:39:33] wasn't a revelation the first place.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And then others rise. And then a wind of
[1:39:37] doctrine blows in. Oh, everybody's just
[1:39:40] caught up in it. My, this is a this is
[1:39:43] the end all. This is the last
[1:39:44] revelation. There is nothing after this.
[1:39:47] This is so exciting. I'm so enthused.
[1:39:50] And they and they get completely swept
[1:39:52] away on it. And as time goes on,
[1:39:57] just fritters away,
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; just where'd it go?
[1:40:02] Well, I don't know. I don't know where.
[1:40:05] Well, wasn't revelation in the first
[1:40:07] place.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; No, when you get a revelation,
[1:40:12] you get a revelation. You get a
[1:40:14] revelation. I tell you what, friends,
[1:40:18] I was ready. I was ready for brother
[1:40:21] Brandham when I sat with him in case he
[1:40:24] brought up the serpent seed
[1:40:28] and I had been forewarned
[1:40:32] and I had memorized the scripture and
[1:40:35] Adam knew his wife and she conceived and
[1:40:38] brought forth a son and called his name
[1:40:40] Cain for I've got a man from the Lord.
[1:40:44] And I thought if I hope this subject
[1:40:46] doesn't come up. I believe it's
[1:40:47] something bad that someone just said
[1:40:49] about him. I don't believe that it is
[1:40:51] true. But if he brings it up, if it
[1:40:54] happens, and I hope it doesn't, but if
[1:40:56] it does, I'm going to quote the
[1:40:57] scripture.
[1:41:01] So when we sat on that log,
[1:41:05] the subject just came up and I remember,
[1:41:08] and you forgive me, I remember raising
[1:41:10] my finger and I said, "Brother Brandham,
[1:41:12] but the scripture says, "And Adam knew
[1:41:14] his wife, and she conceived and bare a
[1:41:17] son and called his name Cain, for I've
[1:41:18] got a man from the Lord."
[1:41:21] He said, "Brother Eddie, that's exactly
[1:41:23] right." What are you saying? That's my
[1:41:26] defense.
[1:41:29] This is my great scripture. He says,
[1:41:31] "But you need to read the next verse."
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what the next verse was.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; That's absolutely the truth. I didn't
[1:41:40] know what the next verse was. He says,
[1:41:42] "And she again bore his brother Abel."
[1:41:45] They were twins.
[1:41:47] Oh,
[1:41:51] that was revolutionary. Not revelation,
[1:41:54] but revolutionary. And then this is what
[1:41:56] he said. He said, "Brother Eddie, you
[1:41:59] just pray, be sincere, and I'll pray for
[1:42:03] you, too, and I believe God will reveal
[1:42:05] it to you." He said, "It can only come
[1:42:07] by revelation."
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; And that was the end of the subject. It
[1:42:11] was about 4 months later.
[1:42:13] I'm in my room and I have my Bible open,
[1:42:17] not to the Old Testament, not to
[1:42:18] Genesis. Serpent seeds a million miles
[1:42:20] out of my mind. And I'm reading Apostle
[1:42:23] Paul's writing. Bear with me in my
[1:42:26] folly, and indeed bear with me, for I'm
[1:42:27] jealous over you with a godly jealousy.
[1:42:29] For I've espoused you unto one husband,
[1:42:33] oh, one husband, that I may present you
[1:42:36] as a as a chasteed virgin to Jesus
[1:42:40] Christ. But I fear lest as the serpent
[1:42:43] beguiled Eve, so your mind should be
[1:42:46] corrupted. Had one fell said it was in
[1:42:49] her mind, but you know the amazing thing
[1:42:51] in the curse, she didn't get migraine
[1:42:53] headaches.
[1:42:56] And when he came and then God came and
[1:42:58] addressed the serpent and he said,
[1:43:00] "Because you did this, not because you
[1:43:02] thought this,
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; because you did this,
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put enmity between thee and
[1:43:08] the woman and between thy seed and my I
[1:43:12] could not get around that. Thy seed, his
[1:43:16] seed." And here God have a man who would
[1:43:18] withstand all religious thought and say
[1:43:21] there's a serpent seed. Right.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus could say to the
[1:43:26] people, "You are of your father, the
[1:43:28] devil."
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; And his deeds you do,
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; for he was a murderer from the
[1:43:33] beginning. He didn't say Cain was a
[1:43:35] murderer from the beginning. He said he
[1:43:37] was a murderer from the beginning
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; and you're of his children.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; And someone says, "Oh, it's just
[1:43:45] spiritual." What difference does it
[1:43:46] make?
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Still lost. Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Still re God rejectors.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Still resist the word of God. Still
[1:43:55] disbelieve the word of God. That day in
[1:43:58] my room with my Bible open, I received a
[1:44:01] revelation from God. And that became a
[1:44:04] foundation of the whole scripture. Then
[1:44:06] I understood Calvary. Then I understood
[1:44:09] circumcision. Then I understood the
[1:44:11] blood sacrifice.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; I'm here to testify to David. It doesn't
[1:44:16] mean anything to you. I'm here to
[1:44:18] testify on my own behalf that God gave
[1:44:21] me a revelation of that. And it's never
[1:44:24] never faded.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; It's stronger today than it ever was.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; You don't have to study it and study it
[1:44:31] and study it. It's a revelation that
[1:44:33] comes from God and it's accurate. And
[1:44:36] I'm convinced that it's what God had in
[1:44:38] his mind has been transferred to the
[1:44:42] individual.
[1:44:44] Hallelujah.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; A man might be an instrument of it to
[1:44:49] bring it to you. But on the other hand,
[1:44:53] a man may not be an instrument. It might
[1:44:55] be God sovereignly bringing it to you.
[1:45:07] Going to be just about 10 more minutes
[1:45:08] and then I'm going to close.
[1:45:11] the thoughts of God.
[1:45:14] This gets tight, but uh if you agree,
[1:45:17] then you can say amen. And the mighty
[1:45:19] God unveiled when Jesus came, if he
[1:45:24] would have come with Noah's message,
[1:45:27] it wouldn't have worked.
[1:45:30] It wouldn't have worked. But Noah was a
[1:45:32] portion of God. He acted a particular a
[1:45:36] peculiar way because he was peculiar and
[1:45:39] his message was peculiar because it was
[1:45:41] the word being made manifest. He goes on
[1:45:44] he says but when he came
[1:45:47] talking about Jesus when he came
[1:45:50] expressed exactly like the testament had
[1:45:52] said he would be expressed.
[1:45:55] Then all of those who were redeemable.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that?
[1:46:03] when he came and expressed. Now, we
[1:46:06] wouldn't deny that Jesus was the word
[1:46:08] made flesh.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; We agree.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Do you agree?
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; All right. So, now here the word
[1:46:15] we're talking about, how was it
[1:46:17] transferred? Here the word became flesh
[1:46:20] and walked amongst the people. No
[1:46:22] different than today.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh and walked
[1:46:26] amongst the people. And he expressed the
[1:46:29] testament. And the Bible says, "Then all
[1:46:32] those who were redeemable
[1:46:35] believed it." And what is believing?
[1:46:38] Believing is the opposite to sin. Sin is
[1:46:41] unbelief. So they believed it and they
[1:46:44] were the redeemable because they were
[1:46:46] the thoughts of God. So when God
[1:46:50] manifested his thoughts
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; on earth and manifested it, those that
[1:46:56] were redeemable believed that
[1:46:58] manifestation.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; And why did they believe it? Because
[1:47:03] they were the thoughts of God
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; in the first place.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, that is so wonderful. It's so rich.
[1:47:10] It's so pure because you were in the
[1:47:14] mind of God. Because you were a thought
[1:47:16] of God. Then when God comes and manifest
[1:47:19] his word, whether it be back there or in
[1:47:21] this day, manifest his word and you see
[1:47:24] the manifestation of it, you believe it.
[1:47:27] You because you're redeemable.
[1:47:30] You have to believe it. And there the
[1:47:32] scripture is is fully fulfilled where it
[1:47:35] says, "I will put my law in their mind."
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; That's God's uh that's God's formula.
[1:47:44] That's God's process of transmitting his
[1:47:47] thought to you.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Now, what is the message? The message is
[1:47:53] nothing less than God's thought.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't only speak it, he manifested
[1:47:59] it.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; And when it was manifested,
[1:48:04] like when I saw the little girl, blind
[1:48:06] girl,
[1:48:07] you see, it wasn't just a miracle.
[1:48:09] There's all kinds of miracles that
[1:48:10] happen. All kinds of ministries have
[1:48:13] miracles, but this one came with a voice
[1:48:16] and a message
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; and a presence.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; God brought you forth
[1:48:29] and by brooding over you the great Holy
[1:48:32] Spirit of God and by revelation you
[1:48:35] recognized your part of the word. I have
[1:48:39] some slides I'm going to read along with
[1:48:41] you.
[1:48:43] And so and at the end of this will be
[1:48:46] the conclusion of the of the message
[1:48:48] even though once again I'm a long ways
[1:48:50] from being done but what do we say? What
[1:48:53] is revelation?
[1:48:54] What is a revelation?
[1:48:58] According to the scripture and according
[1:49:00] to the Greek words which are used and to
[1:49:03] many of you this is very familiar.
[1:49:07] It is to uncover
[1:49:09] or to lay open what has been veiled or
[1:49:12] covered up. It is a disclosure. It's to
[1:49:16] make known or to make manifest or to
[1:49:18] disclose what was previously unknown.
[1:49:23] Now bear with me.
[1:49:28] The scriptures, the scriptures that
[1:49:30] brother Brandham quoted me, I have read
[1:49:34] perhaps
[1:49:36] 50 to 100 times. I'll just be
[1:49:38] conservative. I've read them since my
[1:49:41] youth.
[1:49:43] I read those scriptures. So the words
[1:49:46] and if I read those words, the rain
[1:49:48] falls on the just and the unjust. I say,
[1:49:51] "Well, yep, that's right. Amen." But I
[1:49:54] didn't have any understanding of it.
[1:49:56] just didn't have any understanding. The
[1:49:58] wheat and the tears grow in the same.
[1:50:00] Should we go and pluck up the tears? No.
[1:50:03] Leave them till the harvest time because
[1:50:05] they're so close together. Their roots
[1:50:07] are even intertwined. If you pull them
[1:50:10] up, you may pull up the wheat also.
[1:50:12] Leave them till the harvest time. And in
[1:50:14] the harvest time, I'll send my angels,
[1:50:16] my messengers, and they'll separate
[1:50:18] them.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; How does God separate the people? Jesus
[1:50:22] spoke his word and separated the people.
[1:50:24] God confir God transforms you and
[1:50:27] conforms you by his word. He created the
[1:50:30] earth we're standing on today by his
[1:50:33] word. The sun was by his word and you
[1:50:35] become a son and a daughter of God by
[1:50:38] his word.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; You mature by his word.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; So it's all by his word. But yet other
[1:50:44] people can hear the word, hear the same
[1:50:46] word and mean something different to
[1:50:48] them. That's where revelation comes in.
[1:50:50] You can't you cannot manufacture
[1:50:53] revelation.
[1:50:54] It's something that's divine. It's
[1:50:56] something that God drops into your
[1:50:58] heart.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; And you may look back after this service
[1:51:01] and say, "What have I received
[1:51:05] sovereignly from God
[1:51:09] that I can actually lay my finger on,
[1:51:12] lay my hand on it?"
[1:51:16] Many of you young people that have come
[1:51:17] to church
[1:51:19] and you've heard it preached, you got to
[1:51:21] be born again and you have to have the
[1:51:23] experience in you. What is that
[1:51:24] experience?
[1:51:28] You need to look back and say, "Well, I
[1:51:29] know it's real to my parents,
[1:51:33] but what has really been real to me?
[1:51:36] What's going to hold me when I'm away
[1:51:38] from home? What's going to hold me when
[1:51:40] my peers or my friends or my work
[1:51:43] associates try to persuade me one way?
[1:51:46] What's going to hold me when I am uh you
[1:51:50] know under the maybe the onslaught of of
[1:51:53] of of some other teaching? What's going
[1:51:55] to hold me when somebody sweeps in and
[1:51:56] says, "So, you got to hear this.
[1:52:00] What's going to hold me in that hour?"
[1:52:03] I'll tell you what's going to hold you.
[1:52:04] Your own personal
[1:52:07] revelation. that God has dropped into
[1:52:09] your soul. And you can say this morning
[1:52:12] in all honesty, and I had to before I
[1:52:14] came to this pulpit today, before I came
[1:52:16] to this service earlier in this week, I
[1:52:19] didn't want to come here till I could
[1:52:21] have that and be brutally honest with
[1:52:23] myself. And so, I went back to the
[1:52:26] beginning. I went back in my life.
[1:52:31] I know that that was from God. I didn't
[1:52:36] ask for it. I didn't invite it. I didn't
[1:52:40] learn it.
[1:52:42] Nobody convinced me of it. I wasn't
[1:52:45] gripped with some I I wasn't enamored
[1:52:48] with some uh, you know, charismatic
[1:52:50] ministry.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; It was something, brother Ernie, that
[1:52:55] God
[1:52:57] dropped and illuminated in my heart, my
[1:53:00] heart, my soul. It was like from Genesis
[1:53:02] to Revelation, it all just rippled right
[1:53:04] through the whole scripture in a moment
[1:53:06] of time. It's like God said, "Let there
[1:53:08] be light."
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; And say it with me, there was light.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I've seen it in the
[1:53:20] people of this congregation. I've seen I
[1:53:21] know your individual lives
[1:53:24] and you maybe wrestled with things and
[1:53:27] thought about things
[1:53:31] And it just come in a moment's time.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; That's revelation.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Revelation
[1:53:52] is an appearing.
[1:53:54] Revelation is a disclosure of truth.
[1:53:57] It's instruction.
[1:54:00] instruction
[1:54:02] concerning things before unknown.
[1:54:06] But you may have heard the words but
[1:54:07] didn't know.
[1:54:10] Do we have it?
[1:54:14] Now here we see plainly the complete
[1:54:17] secret of our lives in journey and in
[1:54:21] death and where we go after we die. in
[1:54:26] journey. That's you now this morning.
[1:54:29] You're in your journey
[1:54:33] in death
[1:54:35] and where we go after we die. What is
[1:54:38] God forming us into? Notice there is
[1:54:41] still three stages to perfection. Just
[1:54:44] like he redeems the world. Same way he
[1:54:48] redeems his church, he redeems the
[1:54:50] people in three stages. And out unto
[1:54:54] Adam he said, Because thou hast
[1:54:55] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife,
[1:54:58] and hast eaten of the tree of which I
[1:55:01] commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not
[1:55:03] eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy
[1:55:06] sake. In sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
[1:55:10] the days of thy life. That's why he had
[1:55:13] to redeem it.
[1:55:15] Be That's why there had to be a
[1:55:16] redemption.
[1:55:19] You're in your journey.
[1:55:21] We're in bodies that are corrupting
[1:55:25] in death and where we go after we die.
[1:55:28] The reason that process is so
[1:55:30] significant, so important to us, is
[1:55:32] because this happened. Because the fall
[1:55:35] came and God said to Adam, "Cursed is
[1:55:39] the ground for thy sake." Listen, ladies
[1:55:41] and gentlemen, brothers and sisters in
[1:55:43] Christ, the body you're sitting in is
[1:55:46] part of the earth that was cursed.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:50] Right?
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Is it not? So,
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; wait till you get my age. And many of
[1:55:56] you may not reach that and you'll find
[1:55:58] out this body is of the earth that was
[1:56:02] cursed
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; and it won't live very long and it'll
[1:56:06] get weaker
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; and you'll have pains and aches and we
[1:56:09] say, "Well, that's just life." No, it's
[1:56:11] because it was cursed.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; And God had to have a plan of
[1:56:15] redemption. And this is a plan. three
[1:56:17] stages in your journey here in death and
[1:56:20] after death
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; and that's why the apostle saw Paul
[1:56:23] could say if this tabernacle be
[1:56:25] dissolved we have another one waiting
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; that's the thought of God
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; are you with me
[1:56:36] your body was laying here when God
[1:56:39] cursed the earth
[1:56:41] in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[1:56:43] bread till thou return unto the ground
[1:56:46] for out of it thou was taken, for dust
[1:56:48] thou art, and unto dust thou shalt
[1:56:50] return. God gave the promise, however,
[1:56:53] of a redeemer,
[1:56:55] and I will put enmity between thee and
[1:56:58] the woman, and between thy seed and her
[1:57:01] seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou
[1:57:05] shalt bruise his heel. Isn't it amazing
[1:57:08] the way some people have it in their
[1:57:09] religion? God would be speaking to a
[1:57:11] snake.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't that ridiculous?
[1:57:16] And he's saying that because Eve ate an
[1:57:18] apple. There's no scripture said she ate
[1:57:21] an apple. Says she parttook of the
[1:57:24] fruit.
[1:57:25] And incidentally, you're all the fruit
[1:57:27] of your mother.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; You're the fruit of her womb.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; And you came from the loins of your
[1:57:32] father, from the human tree,
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; and Jesus is the tree of life.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I got to.
[1:57:42] For as much then as the children are
[1:57:44] partakers of flesh and blood, he also
[1:57:47] Christ, he also likewise himself
[1:57:50] likewise took part of the same. What did
[1:57:53] he take part of? He took part of this
[1:57:55] body.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; He took part of the earth.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; He was born
[1:58:00] the kinsman redeemer.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; He had to become flesh.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; So that he could take the curse off of
[1:58:06] you.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; He took part of the same that through
[1:58:14] death he might destroy him that had the
[1:58:17] power of death. And that is the devil.
[1:58:19] That that's very clear.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; And being found in fashion as a man, he
[1:58:24] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:58:27] death, even the death of the cross. And
[1:58:29] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:58:32] us. And we beheld his glory, the glory
[1:58:35] of the only begotten of the father, full
[1:58:37] of grace and truth. And when Jesus was
[1:58:40] being baptized of John, God spoke from
[1:58:43] the heavens, "This is my beloved son in
[1:58:46] whom I'm well pleased." And the brother
[1:58:48] Brandham says in proving his word, and
[1:58:50] what happened? The dove, which was God
[1:58:53] descending from heaven with a voice
[1:58:55] saying, "This is my beloved son in whom
[1:58:58] I am pleased to dwell in." What did he
[1:59:01] come to do? To redeem that part of the
[1:59:06] earth. He Jesus was the beginning of the
[1:59:10] creation of God. That's what he said in
[1:59:12] the to the seventh church age messenger
[1:59:15] because God is not a creation only in
[1:59:18] Christ. He was the beginning of the
[1:59:21] creation of God and God redeemed that
[1:59:24] body when he came down. This is my
[1:59:27] beloved son. I'm well pleased in him.
[1:59:31] And brother Brandon puts it in these
[1:59:33] words and I love it. This is my part of
[1:59:35] the earth that I have redeemed. And from
[1:59:38] this part of the earth, I will redeem
[1:59:40] the rest of it. For he is my word made
[1:59:43] flesh,
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; made manifest. Isn't that wonderful? And
[1:59:47] from this part of the earth, that's why
[1:59:50] the Bible says, "They that are asleep in
[1:59:52] Christ,
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, they shall rise."
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; All that have gone asleep and have
[1:59:59] perished or have died in Christ, they
[2:00:01] shall come forth.
[2:00:04] And through him, he'll redeem the rest
[2:00:06] of it. The whole world, I spoke it into
[2:00:09] existence by my word. Hebrews 11. And
[2:00:12] Satan held it all this time, but I've
[2:00:15] come to redeem it. So much of it as has
[2:00:18] so much of it a has made his body, and
[2:00:22] I'm coming to dwell in it. Oh my. I hope
[2:00:24] that you're grasping this, friends.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; He's coming to redeem what? The body of
[2:00:29] Christ. as many as have made up his body
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; who raised from the dead. Jesus Christ
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; and God came into this little cell, he
[2:00:42] began to develop cells, drew from his
[2:00:45] mother's vitamins and things. Then when
[2:00:47] he became old enough to eat himself and
[2:00:50] what was that? It's the dust of the
[2:00:52] earth which you come up and plant life
[2:00:55] and animal life and so forth. And as he
[2:00:57] began to eat the the fish and the bread
[2:01:01] and and and so forth, it began to
[2:01:04] develop cells. And then when it's fully
[2:01:06] matured at 30 years old, he was baptized
[2:01:08] in obedience to God in the water and
[2:01:11] went out. Later, we find this body Jesus
[2:01:14] Christ on Mount Transfiguration in a
[2:01:16] glorified form with Moses and Elijah.
[2:01:20] Listen you believers now. And there was
[2:01:22] a prophet named Moses. And one day, God
[2:01:25] called him and wouldn't let him go over
[2:01:28] the land. And he died on a rock. The
[2:01:32] angels took him away and buried him. And
[2:01:35] there was another man, an eagle, didn't
[2:01:38] even have to die. He just walked across
[2:01:40] Jordan. And God sent a chariot down. And
[2:01:43] this robe of flesh he dropped and rise
[2:01:45] and caught the everlasting prize. 800
[2:01:49] years later on Mount Transfiguration,
[2:01:51] here stood those two men. Moses' body
[2:01:54] had been rotten for hundreds of years
[2:01:57] and he was in such a form till Peter,
[2:02:00] James, and John recognized him.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were in such a form.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; They didn't have to have a lesson. They
[2:02:10] didn't have to have an education. They
[2:02:12] didn't Jesus didn't have to say, "How do
[2:02:14] you do, Peter, James, and John? I'd like
[2:02:15] you to meet Moses and Elijah."
[2:02:18] in that form they knew them 800 years or
[2:02:22] hundreds of years later they knew them.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous?
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; And that's the kind of body Jesus was
[2:02:30] demonstrating for those of you that
[2:02:32] haven't heard this on Mount
[2:02:34] Transfiguration notice was the whole
[2:02:36] cycle of life.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; There was Peter, James, and John in
[2:02:40] bodies like you have.
[2:02:43] There was Moses and Elijah in a
[2:02:45] theophony body which is just a breath
[2:02:48] away. Apostle Paul said, "If this
[2:02:51] tabernacle is dissolved, you have
[2:02:53] another. We have another. It's in the
[2:02:55] heavens. It's eternal. It's waiting for
[2:02:57] you. And you'll step from this one into
[2:02:59] that one in a moment of time. And then
[2:03:02] when the dead in Christ are raised, that
[2:03:04] theophony comes, claims that body, and
[2:03:06] that's your glorified body." And so on
[2:03:09] the on the mount of transfiguration
[2:03:12] stood the three in bodies like you have.
[2:03:15] That's normal life in this journey. And
[2:03:18] there stood Moses and Elijah. Moses had
[2:03:21] died. Elijah did not die. So one went by
[2:03:26] the way of death. One went by the way of
[2:03:27] a rapture. And there stood Jesus
[2:03:30] glorified. The whole cycle of life was
[2:03:34] there.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Listen to me.
[2:03:38] Surely we can get excited about this.
[2:03:41] They get excited down here at the
[2:03:42] racetrack seeing horse flesh run around
[2:03:44] the track. I'm excited about this kind
[2:03:46] of body. I'm excited about eternal life.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; I'm excited about this kind of message.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; And there on Mount Transfiguration, God
[2:03:59] manifested what was in his mind
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; to Peter, James, and John. Go down,
[2:04:06] write it, tell them, preach it, and send
[2:04:09] this gospel to the Gentiles.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved,
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; If you're an attribute of God expressed
[2:04:27] here on the earth, you've got a body
[2:04:29] waiting
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; after you leave this world. If you're an
[2:04:34] attribute of God, once again, it may
[2:04:37] sound selective. It is.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My sheep hear my voice."
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Those whom he forneew, whom whom he
[2:04:49] forneew,
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; he also did predestinate.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And them that he
[2:04:59] predestinated, he called.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Them whom those?
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't cower.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Don't be in doubt or unbelief.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Don't be questioning.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; If God has sent his spirit and called
[2:05:14] you and there's something down inside
[2:05:16] and you can say, "I know I'm one of his.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; He called me at a certain time. I know
[2:05:22] I'm one of his." Then hear this word.
[2:05:26] Amen.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; You've got a B body waiting for you.
[2:05:31] There they were standing on Mount
[2:05:32] Transfiguration in their theophony for
[2:05:35] they were prophets to whom the word came
[2:05:37] to. What formed them into that
[2:05:39] theophony? The word that came to them.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the transforming word.
[2:05:46] God help me. I'm 10 minutes late
[2:05:48] already.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "And Christ hath redeemed us
[2:05:52] from the curse of the law being made a
[2:05:54] curse for us. For it is written, Cursed
[2:05:56] is everyone that hangeth on a tree.
[2:05:59] Neither by the blood of goats and
[2:06:00] calves, but by his own blood he entered
[2:06:03] in once into the holy place, having
[2:06:05] obtained eternal redemption for us. You
[2:06:08] see the scriptural references there.
[2:06:11] Wisdom versus faith in this message.
[2:06:20] All right.
[2:06:22] The earth itself is a womb. Where did
[2:06:25] God place his seeds? Where are seeds put
[2:06:28] in a womb? And all things were made by
[2:06:30] him. And without without him was not
[2:06:32] anything made that was made. As he
[2:06:36] stands there revealing, this is in the
[2:06:38] last church age revealing who he who he
[2:06:41] is in the last age. He calls himself the
[2:06:45] author of the creation of God. And with
[2:06:48] this, I'm closing. Now I have about
[2:06:49] three more quotes here, three more
[2:06:52] slides. This is another creation. This
[2:06:55] has to do with the church. This is a
[2:06:57] special designation of himself. He is
[2:07:00] the creator of that church. The heavenly
[2:07:03] bridegroom
[2:07:04] created his own bride.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; He's a creator. He created the trees and
[2:07:09] all of these things. We're not so
[2:07:11] interested in that. We're in the
[2:07:12] mountains and all those things. Glory.
[2:07:13] The heavens and all these things. Listen
[2:07:15] friends, if the heavens is something
[2:07:17] that God got satisfaction on, he'd have
[2:07:19] stayed with that. That wasn't it. But he
[2:07:21] says to the prophet Isaiah, "Where's the
[2:07:23] where's my household?
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Where's my family?
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Where is it that where's the house that
[2:07:29] you build me?"
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that every house is
[2:07:32] built by some man, but he that built all
[2:07:35] things was Jesus Christ. And as Moses
[2:07:37] was faithful in all his house, what was
[2:07:39] it? His whole area, his whole realm of
[2:07:42] responsibility. Moses was faithful in
[2:07:44] all of his house. His house was all the
[2:07:47] Exodus people. He was faithful in all of
[2:07:49] his house. So Christ is faithful, a son
[2:07:52] over his house whose house you are.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; He's faithful.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; He's a faithful husband.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; It's going to give you what you need.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; He's going to provide for you and he's
[2:08:06] going to take you where you need to go.
[2:08:08] He's going to take you to father's
[2:08:10] house.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; In my father's house are many mansions.
[2:08:13] If it were not so, I would have told
[2:08:14] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[2:08:16] And if I go to prepare a place, I will
[2:08:18] come again and receive you unto myself.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Risa, for the song
[2:08:23] you sang. I will receive you unto
[2:08:26] myself. The message is his voice
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; receiving you.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; How else you expect it to happen?
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; He send his word and does everything. He
[2:08:36] sends his word and receives you to
[2:08:38] himself.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; And it's him that's present here now to
[2:08:42] take us out of this dimension to that
[2:08:44] one. Amen.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon stood before
[2:08:48] those people and said
[2:08:50] that woman you see you go and see the
[2:08:52] video deep call of the deep and the
[2:08:54] woman standing here. She's the first of
[2:08:56] her number
[2:08:58] and and and the prophet of God's going
[2:09:00] to reveal the very secret of her heart
[2:09:02] in in public in front of the people in
[2:09:03] Washington, I believe DC.
[2:09:07] And she steps and she's here
[2:09:10] and she reaches out her hand to steady
[2:09:12] herself.
[2:09:13] and he said, "It's all right,
[2:09:16] sister. That won't hurt you. That's not
[2:09:19] me. That's him." When she came into the
[2:09:24] close proximity of that presence, she
[2:09:27] became nervous. You know, some people,
[2:09:30] they're waiting to get in to see a a
[2:09:33] famous person or a so-called celebrity
[2:09:37] and and and they're nervous and they
[2:09:40] begin to tremble.
[2:09:42] Friends, this one that I'm speaking of,
[2:09:46] he's not some human. He's not some human
[2:09:48] celebrity. This is one that's just here
[2:09:51] one breath away. He's just in another
[2:09:53] realm. He's the one that came into that
[2:09:55] car. He's the one that he's the one that
[2:09:58] brought the brought it to the thoughts
[2:10:00] of brother Perry Coral. Him not knowing
[2:10:02] his wife's going to be at the point of
[2:10:04] death within a few days, within a few
[2:10:06] hours. Sit down. I want you to hear
[2:10:08] this. I want you to hear. I want you to
[2:10:11] come into this presence. How important
[2:10:13] that is. And I I can see our heavenly
[2:10:15] father saying, "You're here in this
[2:10:17] service. I don't want you just sitting
[2:10:18] here. I want you to come into this
[2:10:20] presence. I want you to grasp what this
[2:10:22] little man's trying to tell you."
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; He's telling you a live testimony.
[2:10:28] There is a presence of God that will
[2:10:30] literally illuminate you
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; and explode with life and transform you
[2:10:35] into a son and daughter of God.
[2:10:39] If that's not true, I'm a false
[2:10:41] preacher.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Bridegroom created his own bride. This
[2:10:48] new creation is not the old creation
[2:10:49] made over
[2:10:52] or it could not be called a new
[2:10:53] creation. This is exactly what it says,
[2:10:55] a new creation. It's another creation
[2:10:57] distinct from the old one. No longer is
[2:10:59] he dealing with the ways of the flesh.
[2:11:02] That is how he dealt with Israel. He
[2:11:04] chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue
[2:11:07] through the godly Isaac line. But now
[2:11:10] out of the every kindred tribe and
[2:11:12] nation, he has purposed a new creation.
[2:11:15] He is the first of that creation. He was
[2:11:17] God's creation in the form of man. Now
[2:11:20] by this spirit, he is creating many sons
[2:11:23] unto himself. God the creator creating
[2:11:26] himself. Amen. This is the true
[2:11:28] revelation of God. This was his purpose.
[2:11:31] This purpose took form through election.
[2:11:33] Amen.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; That is why he could look right down
[2:11:36] through the last age when all would be
[2:11:38] over and see himself still in the midst
[2:11:41] of his church of the church as author of
[2:11:43] the new creation of God. His sovereign
[2:11:46] power brought it to pass and by his own
[2:11:48] decree he elected the members of this
[2:11:51] new creation. He predestinated them to
[2:11:53] the adoption of children according to
[2:11:55] the good pleasure of his will.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:59] And blessed, blessed and holy is he that
[2:12:01] hath part in the first resurrection. On
[2:12:04] such the second death hath no power,
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; but they shall be priests of God and of
[2:12:12] Christ, and shall reign with him a
[2:12:14] thousand years. Behold, I show you a
[2:12:17] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[2:12:19] shall all be changed. Can we say that
[2:12:22] together? But we shall all be changed.
[2:12:25] Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[2:12:27] honor to him. For the marriage of the
[2:12:29] Lamb is come, and his wife hath made
[2:12:32] herself ready. And to her was granted
[2:12:35] that she should be arrayed in fine
[2:12:37] linen, clean and white. For the fine
[2:12:40] linen is the righteousness of the
[2:12:42] saints. Thou art worthy, oh Lord, to
[2:12:44] receive glory and honor and power. For
[2:12:46] thou hast create created all things, and
[2:12:49] for thy pleasure they were created.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; And I say, for thy pleasure,
[2:12:55] You have been created. I have been
[2:12:57] created. We're his sons and daughters.
[2:13:00] That's the whole purpose. That's the
[2:13:01] program of God. Thank you for your time.
[2:13:04] I trust that this would be a blessing to
[2:13:06] you. I'm not one to read a lot of uh
[2:13:10] slides, but I thought it's been a
[2:13:12] blessing and I would cap it off with
[2:13:14] these with this whole series. I tried to
[2:13:16] arrange it so it was in a in a sequence
[2:13:18] of your journey
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; in death
[2:13:23] in a theophony
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; on mount transfiguration as it was
[2:13:28] listen friends that wasn't just for
[2:13:29] Moses and Elijah God that's why he took
[2:13:32] Peter James and John up there
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; and you know what he said read the last
[2:13:38] verses of the chapter previous he said
[2:13:42] to them
[2:13:43] that he's going
[2:13:45] You will not all
[2:13:49] um
[2:13:50] let me just read it as the musicians
[2:13:52] come please.
[2:14:09] Verily I say unto you,
[2:14:13] there be some standing here
[2:14:16] which shall not taste death till they
[2:14:20] see the son of man coming in his
[2:14:24] kingdom.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; And after six days he took Peter, James,
[2:14:28] and John. They were the ones that were
[2:14:30] standing there onto the mount. And when
[2:14:33] he saw, when they could witness, we are
[2:14:35] here in human bodies. Here's Moses. We
[2:14:39] know he died
[2:14:41] hundreds of years ago and he's standing
[2:14:43] here in a body. And here's Elijah. We
[2:14:46] know that he was caught away and carried
[2:14:49] in a whirlwind.
[2:14:52] And here's Christ and he's glorified. No
[2:14:55] wonder Peter got consumed. It's good for
[2:14:58] us to dwell here. Let's build three
[2:15:00] tabernacles.
[2:15:03] And then the voice said, "This is my
[2:15:05] beloved son. hear ye him. And Jesus was
[2:15:10] showing to them his kingdom.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; And we're in that kingdom.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "We are in that kingdom."
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; And we've been called into that kingdom.
[2:15:22] Amen.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; There'll be those standing here. And I
[2:15:27] believe there's those that are probably
[2:15:29] seated here
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; that'll not taste death either.
[2:15:39] If you want to put it away in the
[2:15:40] future, fine. Go ahead.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; But I would say even to I don't want to
[2:15:46] taste death.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; And I don't want anybody to discredit me
[2:15:50] for believing that I can be changed
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; in my atoms and be transformed and
[2:15:56] transformed and transcend the grave.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:02] And if you hear one day that I'm gone,
[2:16:04] just rejoice.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Because I'll also rise.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; For the dead in Christ, I'll rise before
[2:16:13] you're changed.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that?
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; I'll rise before you're changed. For the
[2:16:18] dead in Christ shall rise first,
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; and then we who are alive and remain
[2:16:24] shall be got up together with them in
[2:16:26] the air.
[2:16:29] Hallelujah.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; If I go by the way of the grave, I'm
[2:16:33] going to come by your way sometime.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; But the dead in Christ will rise first.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to come up saddle
[2:16:40] sidle up right beside you and say, "Hey,
[2:16:43] remember me." Say, "No, I don't know
[2:16:45] you. I never saw you before." Well,
[2:16:48] aren't you a believer? Yeah. Yeah, I'm a
[2:16:50] believer. You heard about the
[2:16:51] resurrection? Oh, yeah. I believed it
[2:16:53] all my time. Well, let's get caught up
[2:16:55] to time. It's already happened.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here we are.
[2:17:00] Why don't we just stand, shall we? I'd
[2:17:02] like to just sing. Uh uh I want so many
[2:17:06] things to sing.
[2:17:09] Said I said I found a love that pardons.
[2:17:13] Help me sing it now. Said I love I found
[2:17:15] a love that pardons.
[2:17:18] Say I love
[2:17:22] that.
[2:17:25] Heat. Heat.
[2:17:35] [Music]
[2:17:37] might
[2:17:48] be Jesus.
[2:17:52] Jesus
[2:17:56] Jesus.
[2:17:58] He
[2:18:02] want
[2:18:11] Jesus.
[2:18:14] It's in Jesus.
[2:18:17] For it's in Jesus.
[2:18:22] Jesus.
[2:18:25] Jesus.
[2:18:38] is
[2:18:39] in Jesus.
[2:18:42] He is the
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just feel like rejoicing.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:50] And a wonderful brother Ly. Amen.
[2:18:54] Oh my. Oh my. We're going to drop this
[2:18:57] body
[2:19:00] and seize the everlasting prize. Amen.
[2:19:04] Amen. We're going to dismiss you.
[2:19:07] Brother Lance Laroo is ministering
[2:19:08] tonight. We want you to be here and be
[2:19:10] fresh. We're having a baptismal. Darlene
[2:19:14] Hildebrand, uh, Sister Karen's daughter
[2:19:17] is going to be baptized tonight. Amen.
[2:19:21] Ain't that wonderful? God just puts that
[2:19:22] hunger in their heart. We're so happy
[2:19:25] for her. We don't know who else might be
[2:19:27] baptized. I wonder, brother DD, if you'd
[2:19:29] come and ask God's blessing upon the
[2:19:31] people as they're dismissed and uh have
[2:19:34] some refreshment and come refresh this
[2:19:36] evening. God bless you.
[2:19:40] Let's pray. Father, we like to thank you
[2:19:43] this morning. We recognize that you're
[2:19:45] faithful. You're true. You never fail
[2:19:48] us, oh God. You provide for our needs.
[2:19:51] Father, this morning we're glad that we
[2:19:54] sat at your table, oh God, that you
[2:19:56] prepared food for us, fitted for the
[2:19:58] soul, to encourage us, oh God, to let us
[2:20:01] know of your great plan and your great
[2:20:02] thought that you saw us express in this
[2:20:05] hour, receiving your word, oh God, being
[2:20:08] revelated, Father, to believe for these
[2:20:11] things that seems far-fetched for the
[2:20:13] people of this world, that we know
[2:20:15] there's a rapture, there's a change,
[2:20:17] there's a promise of a resurrection,
[2:20:19] Father, we're looking for these things.

[2:20:33] Holy Spirit the rain will fall upon it
[2:20:35] to bring it into manifestation, Father.
[2:20:38] For we want to be all that you have
[2:20:40] called us to be to give glory unto you
[2:20:43] father but bring this word to life oh
[2:20:45] God by being oh God the expression of
[2:20:48] your very thought in these last days. So
[2:20:51] bless your children, Father. Just give
[2:20:53] us that faith, oh God, that can hold
[2:20:55] upon every promise of God, every word
[2:20:58] spoken, dear God, and thus you'll be
[2:21:01] glorified, Father. Bless your children
[2:21:03] today. Oh God, just give us strength for
[2:21:06] the journey ahead, even for the service
[2:21:08] this evening, Lord Jesus. Just continue
[2:21:10] to deal with lies. Continue to draw us
[2:21:13] closer, Father. Continue to make
[2:21:15] yourself known, Father. We know it's not
[2:21:18] flesh and blood, but it you the Holy
[2:21:20] Spirit ministering unto our souls. Oh
[2:21:23] God, we want to thank you for keeping
[2:21:25] your promise again this morning. For you
[2:21:28] say where two or three gather in your
[2:21:29] name, you'll be there, Father. We
[2:21:32] recognize that you've been here with us.
