Nothing in ourselves that we find, Lord Jesus, but to the cross we cling this morning. The great sacrifice lamb was slain. on our behalf this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I trust Calvary means more to you this morning. Amen. One look at Calvary with an honest heart. with an honest heart and everything pales in comparison. &gt;&gt; Your failings, your weaknesses with an honest heart, friends, your friends failings and their weaknesses pale in comparison to Calvary. My bones, they stare at me. His flesh was hanging off his back. Our weaknesses fail in comparison to Calvary. Our sicknesses hold no moral redeeming value in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can shake them off this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate each one of your lives this morning. trust that this resurrection morning will have a new meaning to us. Amen. Happy Father's Day to all of our fathers. God bless you on this resurrection morning. Amen. Amen. Amen. We want to remember our brother Tom this morning ministering with the saints down in Seattle at Brother Mockmoods. So, if we don't see some of the ones that have been driving up recently over the last several months, we trust that they just have a real blessed time as we have a real blessed time in the presence of the Lord this morning. It's good to have all the visitors with us. Switzerland, from Arizona. I've got a list of names. Brother John Peterson, Brother Matthew and Sister Kim Potter, Sister Emily Clayville, Brother Bill and Sister Mary Ivy, Brother Oed and his wife Dioa, Brother Gerard and Sister Angela Michel from Switzerland. Amen. &gt;&gt; They come from the east and the west, &gt;&gt; from the lands of far. &gt;&gt; So the scripture has been fulfilled yet again. this morning in our very midst and we wouldn't want to miss that opportunity. I'm just going to have brother John come and lead the congregation of people in prayer this morning. We do want to remember brother Hugh messages sister Sylvia's sister sick in need of a healing touch this morning and uh need from Helen Smith also with a many may know her as good from up in White Horse I believe just as a real unspoken request and ask that the Lord would intervene on her behalf. Amen. And if you have a need upon your heart this morning with an honest heart, just make it known by the uplifted hand to he who sees every need. Amen. I just wanted to give a quick testimony. We've just had a few hours with our brother Ivy in fellowship and he gave me a testimony of a family in his church that had three children. And I think they were three daughters raised in the message, but at a certain time they they just left the Lord. They went out into the world. And I believe it was this last Easter season, he was baptizing, Brother Ivy was baptizing another individual and one of those young ladies was at the service and she just came literally almost running to the altar. And I think it was the next week or a short time after that, she rededicated her life to the Lord and was baptized again. God is in the restoration business. &gt;&gt; All the years &gt;&gt; and just when you think like things are just shattering, falling apart, and you don't know what to do, Jesus Christ is able to bring it all back together again. &gt;&gt; He's a wonderful father. &gt;&gt; So, he's our healer today. He's the restorer. He's the deliverer. He's the He's the answer to all of our needs. &gt;&gt; So, the world might call it Father's Day, but we take this opportunity to say, "Our great Father." &gt;&gt; From where all of our answers and all of our whatever we have need of, just plug into him today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we lift up our hands, God. We're surrounded around the altar of sacrifice. You, the lamb of God, are the sacrifice. The only one that was worthy that stepped forward and took the book, &gt;&gt; took our past, took our present. You knew our future. You even knew before we were born, the pathway of our lives. How many times we would forsake you, go away, fall. But you came to us, Lord. Your grace, Lord, made a way where there seems to be no way. Your healing came bursting through. Your deliverance set us free. This morning, we want to give praise. We lift up our hands. One hand, two hands. Most of all, our hearts, God. We want to give you glory. We want to give you praise. We want to open up our mouths and say, "Thank you, Jesus. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom has come. Your will is being done in this earth as it is in heaven. Consume us this morning. God, let your word be manifested, all over this building, all over the unseen, the internet, the phone hookup, and even beyond these walls. As prayers are coming up as odors, we're reminded of the testimony of our brother Ivy, how you can save souls and win hearts. God, we were all calloused. We were all broken. We were all a stranger from you. I'm I'm reminded of the father that was looking down the road and all of a sudden a son started coming down the road and he ran toward him. What a rejoicing God. What a day this is Lord that you can restore all things to our lives and we can cry aba father my father our father the same being that was present lord in the tabernacle years ago when you broke those seals is very very near today you attended your prophet in the meetings you was with the believers the martyrs those that gave their lives brothers and sisters ers, Lord, and we we put our lives up next to theirs as they without us are not made perfect. Would you perfect our lives today, God? There's needs all over. Our hands are lifted up. We are a needy people, but we serve a great God, and our faith is in you. We are resting our faith in your word, God, that nothing you have spoken will return to you void, but you will accomplish what you sent it out to do. accomplish it within these lives. God, let the supernatural just break out through the service as we are not in a form or just a ritual of a meeting. But Lord, we are looking to you to touch our souls, transform lives, move into areas of the unseen, people's lives and their spirits, God, into their bodies. Satan may try to hide, demons may try to hide, but the great doctors on the case today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, we embrace your word. We whatever you say to us, Lord. Let your presence draw near to every life. We want to thank you, God. May you move into the room, Lord. there where the brothers and sisters in Tacoma, Seattle, Federal Way are gathering and may you pour out your spirit on that meeting. Lord, your will be done and may you just direct these lives. Lord, &gt;&gt; Sister Helen has a need, Lord, from White Horse. May you minister to her. &gt;&gt; Every unspoken request, every heart, we're here this morning, Jesus, for a divine encounter with you. We want you to touch our lives in a way that no church, no man, no friend, no individual. We're wanting to go beyond all of that, Lord, into a place where it's God, you, and us alone. So we shut away everyone else, all of our feelings, all of our thoughts, all of our strong opinions, and let your word just come to its meeting place. We commit this service to you Lord in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My hope is in the Lord from this time on and My [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. You may have your seats this morning. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. We've got a quick announcement we need to make. We're going to have a baby dedication this morning. Brother Toby and Sister Rebecca Caillumbi are going to have their little one dedicated. Our pastor is going to come this morning. Brother Toby and Sister Rebecca, if you could come. Brother Richard Drake wants to announce that next Sunday. Our Sunday school children will be singing in the sanctuary, presenting also their missionary offering. Please have the children here at the church at 9:45 sharp so they can get their practice done before the song service starts. That would be a real blessing if you could be here. Amen for that. Why don't we sing together? Jesus loves me, this I know. For the Bible tells me so. Jesus loves me this I know. For the Bible tells me so. Little ones. To him belong. They are weak but he is strong. Yes Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. [Music] Jesus loves me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a grand a grand occasion. brother Toby and sister Rebecca and uh her uh some of her parents are here. I mean her mother and family is here and her father I was actually just spent some time with him in Switzerland and brother Toby's parents are here and that is really wonderful. I'm going to ask uh brother Cailloui, if you would please come and join me. Brother Caillou is a senior pastor and uh I'm sure they dedicate children by the hundreds, [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Mother Cobi. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; It's a a pillar a pillar in the church. God bless you. I'd like you to just be here with me, brother Caumbi. Well, I make I make some comments and there it's it's very important I think to have your father here at this time. Jesus said that they brought young children to him and you have brought your children and your son that God has given you. Sister Rebecca and brother Toby. And they brought the children to him that he should touch them. And this is what I want to draw the attention to the people that he should touch them. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them. And there may be some here that don't understand it fully. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said to them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for such is the kingdom of God. And whosoever shall receive the kingdom of God as a little child, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall not rece not enter therein." And then it says that he took them up in his arms and put his hands upon them and bless them. Uh this isn't uh you know a baby dedication. This is actually a transfer of the blessings of God upon a child. I began to think about that. I've never really thought about it in the light and in the way that I have been thinking about it for the last day or two. When Jesus was a babe and uh Mary and Joseph brought him, the Bible says that Simeon took up the baby Jesus into his arms and he thanked God that now he had seen the salvation of God. then took he up in his arms and blessed God. That he had seen the salvation of God. Brother Brennham said many, many times, dozens of times, I lay my hands on you for the blessing. &gt;&gt; Why? Why didn't he just say you're I bless you? But he said, I lay my hands on you for the blessing of God. I got thinking about this and brother Toby, sister Rebecca, it's why I wanted your father here also. Joseph brought his sons to his father Jacob. And he just wanted his father, which would be the grandfather of the children, to lay his hands on them. But he had it figured out in his mind which hand he wanted on which child. So he brought them Manasseh and Ephraim and Manasseh on one side, Ephraim, that he would be that he would be blessed and put the blessing on those children and when when he brought them to the grandfather, Jacob crossed his hands and the father said, "Not so." But when he was crossing his hands, God was reflecting through him the cross of Calvary. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that the blessing, the blessing not only came to the son and in that order, but the blessing came to us. &gt;&gt; And we were reflected back then and he would God was reflecting on earth that the gospel is going to come to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; I say today, thank God for that touch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God that grandfather put his hands on his grandsons and the right ones &gt;&gt; and the blessing would come to us. &gt;&gt; And we are going to lay our hands upon this son who has been named Joshua. I'm saying it correctly. Is that right? Good enough. Samuel. And I learned that his name Samuel. Uh they decided Samuel at quarter to 1 this morning. His name was changed at quarter to 1 this morning and brother Toby doesn't know this but I had a email from another brother and I wanted to get it and I didn't have a chance to read it. So, I had my Blackberry in my hand trying to find that and I felt it vibrating. I thought, "Who in the world is calling me at quarter to 1 in the morning and I opened it up and it's brother Toby." And he says, "His name's not Andreas, it's Samuel. We've just changed it." So, praise the Lord. We have Joshua, Joshua. Samuel. And it is Samuel of course is L. That means God or God heard. And Joshua is Jehovah. Uh Jehovah is salvation and the existing one. And those things are fine for us to understand. But what's important I want I'm going to take the child. I want your father to lay hands on this child as well as we pray and dedicate it. Amen. Hallelujah. What a sacred moment. &gt;&gt; This child that you've given to brother Toby and Rebecca and father from many, many miles away has come the grandfather and grandmother. And we lay our hands upon this child to dedicate it to you in the name of Jesus Christ. And we pass blessings, oh God, from the father and from the grandfather and from the grandparents down to this child. &gt;&gt; May this child be a blessing in the home. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May this child be blessed with good health. May this child be blessed as a vessel of the testimony of Jesus Christ. I pray, oh God, that you'll give the mother and father wisdom to guide the footsteps and to teach him the word of God in the name of Jesus Christ. May revelation come to him early &gt;&gt; and Lord may he be a great blessing I pray amongst others as he grows up to be uh to be a real example father keep them in good health I pray and now Lord we pass these blessings the blessings of our Lord Jesus Christ as we stand here as your servants in Jesus name we dedicate him to you amen &gt;&gt; amen Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Toby. &gt;&gt; Bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, we're happy to have all the visitors that are with us and uh a lot of our people are away. Some are down in in Seattle to the want to have a service there this morning. So that was fine. We want them to know we miss them. &gt;&gt; Yes, we certainly do. This evening where we have a special treat. We have our brother Bill Ivy, pastor from Gibson's, Missouri, and his wife, Sister Mary are here with us. I'd like if they would stand so you'll know who's going to be speaking tonight. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We've known our brother and sister Ivy for quite a few years and uh I I've had the privilege of being to their church on one occasion. We really appreciate that. And we have staying with us in our home uh brother Gerard and sister Angela Michel. And I'd like them to stand because I want to make a special uh note about Sam. God bless them. This is the couple that one day about six years ago, I read an email and we get quite a few emails each day and I was reading the email and uh and I'm sure they won't mind me just saying this. I'll make it brief. I just started I made maybe read two lines and just you know we we streamed the meeting and I or I streamed the meeting. I enjoyed the the service and just at that time the Holy Spirit spoke as clear as I'm speaking to you. He said, "This is from a wounded one and her husband doesn't know she sent this." And it was the sister Angela and I got maybe two or three more over spread over some weeks. And then I got quite a long one email one day. Sometimes they were fairly long. And I just started to read that email and just as I started to read it, the same voice said, "Now her husband knows." And I looked quickly to the bottom of I scrolled down to the bottom and it was the same same last name. I said, "Well, isn't that something?" And then they invited us to come and stay in their home. Uh and uh I and my wife we we were going to Ukraine and we had 5 days that were we we didn't really have we we were over there already in Europe and we had 5 days before we had to go to the Ukraine and it was kind of an awkward timing and awkward scheduling and we said well let's let's see if uh it would be all right for us to visit brother George and sister Angela we ever met. And uh so they picked us up and took us to their home and gave us a beautiful room and and I sat there and we hardly ever ever stay in people's homes. I stay locked up in a motel. I study. I go to the meeting and go back to the room. And that's been our schedule. And I'm sitting in this room and I said to my wife, "What are we doing here? This is so strange. What are we doing here?" And uh from that such a friendship and a bond and God has opened a door uh to others and uh we've made wonderful friends amongst them. And so thank you, brother George and sister Angela. We have also and I failed to mention brother Joe Riley is here. I saw you, brother Riley, in the one of the last services and failed to mention you you being there. Brother Riley was with brother Brandham, his son, and they took him out fishing and all these things. I wonder, brother Joe Riley, if you would stand because our brother Joe Riley has passed 90 years old. Past 90, isn't that right? You've had your 90 birthday and he's up here fishing. Lord, I've got a few years yet. only have some people take me fishing. That's wonderful. Yeah, I think brother Mark Matul and others may be taking brother Joe Riley fishing. Well, I I I'm proud of you, brother Riley, and and envious. And he's had a lot of experiences and gave a testimony also. We're just thankful for everyone. Won't it be wonderful when we aren't restricted with time and we don't have to have a service as such? We'll be around the marriage uh wedding table, a supper, and that's that's only the beginning. &gt;&gt; Then from then on, what are we going to do? &gt;&gt; We're going to worship him. We're going to fellowship. We're going to And it's hard to conceive eternity, isn't it? &gt;&gt; But you do believe it, do you? I can't even say it's going to be a long time because there is no time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here this morning. &gt;&gt; Well, we could talk on and on, but we want you to stand if you would, and we're going to read the word of God. Uh, where's Brother Timothy from Johannesburg and his wife Shantel? right here. Brother Timothy, raise your hand. This brother flew the other day with his whole family, his wife, and two children, Brother Paul, his son, and we sort of respect them. He flies here for his vacation from Johannesburg just to have vacation to be here at the church. God bless you, brother Timothy and Sister Shantel. We appreciate that. Let's just have a word of prayer before we read. Dear Father, how lovely it is, your presence, your holiness, clean spirit, Holy Spirit. how we love your Holy Spirit, oh God, and that you have filled us with that Holy Ghost. And if there's any here that have not experienced that that baptism, they may have been in water, but may they be baptized &gt;&gt; with the Holy Spirit, even while the word is being preached. &gt;&gt; Let them receive the word and the spirit will come and make the word alive. &gt;&gt; This is your promise. It is yay and amen to all who believe. Lord, we thank you for all the people that are here this morning and the guests that have come and we just pray your blessing upon the reading of the word and the and the message this morning that you've laid upon my heart. We just commit this time to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just before we read, we have uh our graduates which we had a graduation time last night. Could you put that picture up, please? Can we dim the lights, please? Isn't that a nice group? I just want to say something about this group. Every single one of them expressed such a desire for God in their heart. And I had more people come to me last night than at any graduation I've ever been in. And one even I got an email this morning said it was like a service. It was such a godly atmosphere. There was no frivolity. There was no nonsense. It was just a lovely lovely atmosphere. And all of you people that were there, we appreciate that. And I say to these graduates, God bless you and God grant the desire of their heart and the scriptures. They all gave scriptures and quotes that God had made real to them. And I pray that that God will lead you all the days of your life &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. If you'll take your Bibles and open please to Matthew's Gospel, the 16th chapter. We'll read from the 13th verse. When Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?" And they said, "Some say that thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremas or one of the prophets?" He said unto them, "But whom say ye that I am?" And Simon Peter said unto him, answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. And I say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whosoever thou shalt and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats. I'm going to move along as quickly as possible. I will ask for your full and kind attention and as little movement as possible please so that we can remain as focused as possible. This is uh the message I think will be in in in simplicity and yet in simplicity often in fact is very often there is depth that's almost incomprehensible and that and God is in simplicity. It's simplicity that's our problem friends. It is so simple. We go over it or it goes over our heads. So ask that God will give you such discernment and that such a grasp of the simplicity of the gospel that we'll be able to grasp the thought Jesus has said here and the these phrases. I will build my church or my called out ones. And quite frankly, that's the only church that exists. There's other gatherings. There's other clubs. There's other churches as uh as we speak of them as being churches. But the only church that actually exists is what Jesus has called and claimed my church. &gt;&gt; That's the church. Because the church is the ecclesia. It is the called out persons. And if they're called out, something and someone had to call them out. And he says, "This is my church. &gt;&gt; I will build it. There is no other builder than he himself who is the creator of all things. All things were made by him, including the church. &gt;&gt; And without him was nothing made that is made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the word of God that came out of the bosom of the father, which we'll go into just a little bit later. And it is supremely supremely important to identify I. Who is this? I will build my church. Is it the man Jesus of Nazareth that walked the shores of Galilee and lived in Nazareth? Who's who was born of the Virgin Mary? Well, in part that is so. Yet uh I can tell you that when Peter said, "Thou art the Christ," &gt;&gt; he was not looking just merely at the man, the physical man that was standing in front of him. He was looking into the unseen. He was looking beyond the flesh. He was looking beyond this physical one who got weary and had to sleep, who persspired like anyone else in the heat, who got hungry and had to eat, who uh who who who lived a very common life. And because of that that common life that he lived, everybody for the most part missed him. So he said, "Who do they say that I am?" And some said, "He's a good man. He is a great teacher. &gt;&gt; Uh he is one of the prophets. &gt;&gt; And they had uh many phrases. They said uh hosana &gt;&gt; a week before he was crucified. Hosana &gt;&gt; in the highest &gt;&gt; uh the king of the the son of David. &gt;&gt; But they were still missing it &gt;&gt; to the woman at the well. Uh, she said, 'I perceive that you're a prophet, a compliment. You're Elijah, a compliment. Are you John the Baptist that has raised from the dead? Are you Elijah? Are you Jeremiah? Are you one of the prophets that has come? Those are all compliments. But none of those confessions would put a person into his church. That's right. [Applause] &gt;&gt; In Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And follow this very close if you would. And if you wish to make a note, it's fine. Brother Brandham asked a question. How do you know it's this is right? How do you know it's right? He here's the answer. He the word is vindicated. Vindicated simply means to show somebody or something that it's correct. &gt;&gt; To demonstrate it's proven correct. &gt;&gt; It's unmistakably correct. &gt;&gt; Unqualified correct. &gt;&gt; God proves it correct. &gt;&gt; Supernaturally. He proves it correct. &gt;&gt; It's vindicated. And by identifying that you become a material, a building stone &gt;&gt; for his church. &gt;&gt; And he said the word is vindicated. He the word properly properly vindicated is the headship. &gt;&gt; The head of the church. &gt;&gt; He's the word, the headship. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's properly identified. &gt;&gt; Properly identified. We're talking about building the church. He said, "How do you know it's right?" It's vindicated. It's properly identified. &gt;&gt; And then vindicated by his own spirit. &gt;&gt; It's not someone's enthusiasm. It's not someone else's inspiration. It's not some very uh uh someone who is an actor and can put the words and thoughts and connect things together. It's not that. It's not a human uh inspiration. It is the spirit of God that comes and supernaturally does something that no man can do and proves that the word that is spoken is true. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you identify that &gt;&gt; as being that has to be Messiah, &gt;&gt; that is the word of God, &gt;&gt; then you become qualified &gt;&gt; to be put into this building. And he said &gt;&gt; by his own spirit being in the church itself. The person. The person. &gt;&gt; Not just a good feeling. The person, friends, &gt;&gt; we're talking about a person. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be stressing this very strong. &gt;&gt; Showing forth himself. &gt;&gt; The person showing forth himself by vindicating. I'm not doing the vindicating. He's doing the vindicating. &gt;&gt; And and and the message which we believe, which I have been stressing over the last months, the message we believe, it's not because it's some formulated doctrine has come out of some school. God took a vessel and proved supernaturally all the years that the vessel uh uh ministered uh every all the years that brother Brandham was present right to the very end right to the very end proved that that was God's word &gt;&gt; you have to identify that it's God's word &gt;&gt; not a man's word &gt;&gt; and God didn't say now you all have to go and do the same thing No, Jesus said, "Believe on him whom God has sent." &gt;&gt; How do we do the works of God? They want to do something. How do we do the works of God? This is the works of God that you believe on him whom God has sent. &gt;&gt; God so loved the world, he gave one of the graduates was favorite scripture. God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life, eternal life, &gt;&gt; believing on him whom God hath sent. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "If you don't believe me, believe for the work's sake. Believe the supernatural things that are happening." Amen. &gt;&gt; He said showing himself in vindication is the direct proof of the entire body. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said you don't need creeds then. &gt;&gt; You don't need denominations. &gt;&gt; He said denominations has perished. But the headship itself recognized in the body by the personal identification personally identifying himself proves the headship to the body. &gt;&gt; Then then notice the word then we are united. &gt;&gt; Our vindicated headship that is Christ. That's Christ. &gt;&gt; That's a person. That's not a book. That's not a tape. That's not It's not even this book. This book is what speaks of him. But he is a person. &gt;&gt; He's alive &gt;&gt; by his holy spirit. &gt;&gt; He's present &gt;&gt; by his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One vindicated headship that is Christ, the word of God, not under any church. He said then our headship is a kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now I want to move into this phase. The method the method because brother Brandham said he doesn't change his method. The method of this divine builder is to reveal himself. That's what we've just been reading. The method of this builder is to reveal himself or make himself known to you personally. &gt;&gt; Now it's not just a single experience. This is a continual life. &gt;&gt; He continues to reveal himself to us personally. And by that inner knowledge or that inner revelation, you are shaped &gt;&gt; from the inside out. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said the first thing that he wanted to do now this God that we are here this morning worshiping and saying that we are his children. He said God wanted to reveal himself &gt;&gt; to the people and he could not do it as a great Jehovah. You've heard me quote this perhaps many times. He couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space, time, and eternity. It starts to make us very feel very insignificant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this goes far beyond us. We've had young people just graduate. I can tell you, you could live a thousand years and you'll never figure this one out. You'll never figure God out. &gt;&gt; This God that fills all God fills all space. He fills the space between you and I. &gt;&gt; God fills all time and space. He doesn't know anything about yesterday or tomorrow. God's eternal. &gt;&gt; He's allotted time for us humans and for his creation. And it it evolves and changes. But God God has never had a beginning. You can't figure that out. God will never have an end. You can't figure that out. And that God spoke out of his own being eternal words and became manifested here on earth in certain human beings. And that's why Jesus said, "My sheep hear my voice." &gt;&gt; And those sheep are as eternal as he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I will not lose one of them. &gt;&gt; And if you're here in that state, &gt;&gt; that ought to thrill your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God, but he wanted to be made known. He said he's too great to ever be revealed to the people because it would be too mysterious. It is mysterious even when I try to consider it and think of it. How could that great being that never did begin and after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space? It's amazing how brother Brandham uses scientific terminology of light space &gt;&gt; that didn't come from a seventh grade seventh grade a seventh grade education &gt;&gt; times of light space billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space &gt;&gt; and on out into the infinite into eternity &gt;&gt; and a great creature that was all of that and still is now all of that mysterious here the prophet brings this great mysterious uh uh incomprehensible God and he brings it down. But what he wanted to do, he loved. He pulls out of the very heart of God. He loved fatherhood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is Father's Day. I think like what brother John said, every day is Father's Day really. But he loved fatherhood. &gt;&gt; And he said, "For he was a father." that attribute was in him to be a father. And if he had that attribute in him to be a father, he needed to have a son. &gt;&gt; He needed to have a family. &gt;&gt; And he and he goes on to say he was a father. And please note this. Please put it on your fridge, on your wall. At least hold it in your heart. And the only way, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; the only way that he could express express it was to become a son of man. &gt;&gt; He had to become a son of man. When you identify the son of man, Jesus Christ, it was him. &gt;&gt; It was he who was the in expression of the invisible God. And the little things that he did, taking up a child in his arms is part of the attribute of God. God wanted to embrace children. &gt;&gt; His attribute, his son embraced children. God wanted to touch the sick. &gt;&gt; And so his son touched the sick. &gt;&gt; And they were supernaturally healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is why the prophet of God in this age which was called to reveal the son of man touch the people. &gt;&gt; Come and let me bless you. &gt;&gt; And they came. And you know what? They were blessed. &gt;&gt; They did receive the blessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Multitudes received the blessing. Why? because it was the father who loved fatherhood revealing the son of man in this hour. &gt;&gt; And that's the only way that this great eternal being beyond all science, beyond all learning, beyond our puny, insignificant minds, the only way he could be understood. And when that great one, our father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, &gt;&gt; thy kingdom come, and thy will be done &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven. In heaven, he wanted a family. In heaven, he wanted to touch people. In heaven, he wanted to embrace him. In heaven, he wanted them to know him. &gt;&gt; How could he be known in heaven? He wanted a response, &gt;&gt; not forced. &gt;&gt; He wanted a response from the people. He wanted he wanted to become made so real and so close in his presence to just permeate people that they freely would say, "Oh, father." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. how I love you. &gt;&gt; Thank you for sending forth Jesus Christ. Thank you for revealing your word. Thank you, Lord. You've revealed your word. I see the person. &gt;&gt; Not a book, not a stack of books, not just a lot of technical tech technical things, but I see a person. The person &gt;&gt; I feel the touch. &gt;&gt; Amen. Recognizing that when you recognize that which I've just described and you recognize it, it's not this building, not any building. &gt;&gt; It's a persons &gt;&gt; who've come in direct contact &gt;&gt; with the by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; with this person &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ, God revealed Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you identify that that is the one &gt;&gt; that is one that Jesus Christ has said, "Blessed art thou Simon Barjonah." &gt;&gt; When he said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you, but my father which is in heaven, and upon this rock, upon that kind of a confession." He couldn't make the confession till he saw the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just the man walking. It wasn't just Jesus of Nazareth. It was He saw the son of God. &gt;&gt; He saw the He saw what came out of the bosom of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The invisible God which cannot be understood by the human mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Determined that he would make himself known to his creation. And I want to just direct your thoughts into two into two phases here that he determined that he would make himself known. One is by direct revelation &gt;&gt; and the second is by taking human vessels whom he called prophets and to speak his spoken word through them. And that word then to you does not become some intellectual understanding. That word to you becomes an illumination within and it becomes a person to you &gt;&gt; and you engage into a relationship with that person &gt;&gt; and then you are built into the church and that is the church Jesus was talking about. There is no other church and I want to speak about how that church is built. how that church is made. &gt;&gt; So by direct revelation, I'm going to move just quickly through this. By direct revelation, Abel, Abel, Brother Brandham says Abel, quoting the scripture, by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain. Both boys offered. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Both boys prayed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Both boys built an altar. &gt;&gt; Both boys worship the same God. &gt;&gt; Nothing's changed, friends. &gt;&gt; We got the same thing today. &gt;&gt; There's people in this building or people in that building or people they call the Billings church. It's not the church. It's buildings. &gt;&gt; They're in that sanctuary or this temple or they're in that synagogue or whatever more. The buildings is irrelevant to God. It's what's inside the building. And the only there's only one church. &gt;&gt; It's the church that Jesus built. &gt;&gt; And that church is living stones, &gt;&gt; living people who have actually seen the supernatural be vindicated. &gt;&gt; When I hear it or I read it, I see it &gt;&gt; and I say, "That's a person. That's my God. That's my Lord Jesus Christ. That's the revelation of God Almighty. I see him. I want to enter into a relationship with him. I want to walk closer with him because I know that's the only material that Jesus Christ can take and say, "I will build my church." &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, outside of that, &gt;&gt; there's really nothing in this world. &gt;&gt; We might as well just live like a bunch of animals and eat, drink, and be merry and die like &gt;&gt; all flesh. &gt;&gt; Not for me, friends. &gt;&gt; If there is a if there is a possibility &gt;&gt; of having eternal life, &gt;&gt; one thing is absolutely certain. Everybody who's living and and present in this building today, you you were born and you were born of a woman. you issued from some woman's womb. And I can guarantee you, every person is going to take their last breath outside of the rapture, which is the change of the body while we're alive. And that's a mysterious thing, too. But it's promised. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall not all die. We shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a promise. We shall be changed. I don't even understand how I was formed in my mother's womb. Do you? I don't even know. I started from a spine and and and how these organs work and how it all began to function in the in the and the few seconds of in the birth and how I took a breath and how I came. I don't understand anything about it. Neither do you. &gt;&gt; Oh, we can get into the technicalities of of of the medical field. What is it that came that &gt;&gt; burst of breath of life &gt;&gt; and a prophet comes said a spirit entered it. The human spirit entered it and we became alive. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; But Abel had a direct revelation. &gt;&gt; And somehow it was just something in him. He knew there wasn't any and nobody told him. His father mother didn't teach him but he went out to the field and he starts searching for a certain kind of a a lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he picks the right kind of lamb and he begins to slay this lamb to see blood to pay for the redemption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, the Bible is full of strange things. &gt;&gt; And I know we like to have church and have everything nice. So in order everything everything clean and quiet or whatever more. Uh but let me just tell you friends sometimes God allows some things that are very irregular to happen &gt;&gt; and we're not in control of it. &gt;&gt; But we want to say father God have your way &gt;&gt; whatever it takes to glorify yourself. &gt;&gt; And he says both boys worship the same God. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Both boys worshiped the same God and one was accepted and the other was turned down. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I will build my church." &gt;&gt; Lots of people are in buildings and some are accepted and others are turned down. I'm sorry, friends, and I'm not sorry. I don't apologize. That that was the bare naked facts. &gt;&gt; Some are accepted and some are turned down. There's only one way to be built into this and that is by a revelation from God by the Holy Spirit. That the message that came to you is the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there is no other way. &gt;&gt; That's the only way that he can become a father &gt;&gt; and it's the only way you can become a son &gt;&gt; or a daughter. &gt;&gt; There is no other way. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? There is no other way. Has nothing to do with our background or or the the things that we experienced or I saw flashes of light. Just forget all of that. &gt;&gt; I heard the word &gt;&gt; from a messenger &gt;&gt; that was supernaturally &gt;&gt; vindicated. &gt;&gt; Proven correct. I played a tape for a very dear friend of mine, Catholic all his life, still a Catholic today, a fine person. Do you know that? He told me he goes every morning to the church and prays. He told me that not very long ago. I go to the church every morning and pray that I may enter into the kingdom. I doubt if there's anybody here that does that. &gt;&gt; If it was on sincerity, he ought to make it. &gt;&gt; And he's sincere. He had an aneurysm. He hunted between life and death. And he said since that time and we worked together in the same office. He was even my partner and at noon he would go up to the any church that was close and pray. And he told me I pray every morning that I may enter into the kingdom. I pray that God will reveal himself. I played a tape. We were traveling together and I had brother Brandham on. And brother Brandham now comes with the vindication &gt;&gt; and begins to tell the people the secret of their hearts and he's listening. And I asked him, I said, "Bob, did any of your popes ever do that?" He said, "No, &gt;&gt; that should have been enough." Did any of the great church leaders do that for 30 years? No. &gt;&gt; That's why I believe it. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm a I'm a fanatic if they wish to say or a heretic if they wish to say. But God Almighty, this God that cannot be seen and cannot be felt and cannot be understood. He's too mysterious. But he came down in this generation &gt;&gt; and made it very clear this is me &gt;&gt; and when you say that is the Christ &gt;&gt; that's the word of God &gt;&gt; that is the Messiah &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; and Jesus is saying clearly to you you're the material &gt;&gt; I'll build my church &gt;&gt; and you become a part of the church the church. &gt;&gt; Don't go away from here saying I said coil Bible way is the church. No, the church is the called out ones. &gt;&gt; All over the earth, the church is the called out ones. &gt;&gt; But Satan knowing that this is the only way that you can come in. He has a myriad, &gt;&gt; a multitude &gt;&gt; of substitutes &gt;&gt; that are so close. &gt;&gt; Oh, I felt something. That doesn't mean a thing. &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel something. You have to believe something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I felt such a warm feeling. Or I wept. It was such an experience. You might have all of those, but there's one thing that you must do. You must hear the word that God has sent and believe it with all your heart and soul. &gt;&gt; And that is when God starts to take you and shape you &gt;&gt; so that you can be built into the kingdom &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, friends, don't take this message lightly. This is the only church. That's the only church. &gt;&gt; Not this building. &gt;&gt; He said, "No one told no one told Abel that Cain was wrong." Brother Brandham even says about about Cain. No one told him he was wrong when he was doing all of his worshiping. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says it has come. It it has to come spiritual revelation. Flesh and blood. Never told Cain that he was wrong. Never told Abel that Cain was wrong. &gt;&gt; But it was a revelation that Abel had. He had something come over him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somehow it's blood. &gt;&gt; I've got to shed some blood. &gt;&gt; He'd never seen it done before. It had never been taught before. There was no books. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody told him to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might hear this message for the first time and nobody told you that this is the this is thus say the Lord that this is the way to eternal life. But you heard it and something inside of you said, "I believe that." &gt;&gt; Even before you knew what it was all about. Even before you knew what was required of you, there was something inside said, "I believe that &gt;&gt; and furthermore, this is what I must do &gt;&gt; and this is the way I must go." &gt;&gt; And nobody's telling me that I got to go this way. But something inside is saying I must go this way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] We had a little brother. He was a Catholic brother. I had his funeral. He became very very dear to me. Brother Amy Mulan, most of this church knew him. And brother Amy told me, he says, "Brother Ed, when I first heard this message, because he had given himself in the Catholic faith, he even went over to Borneo on a on a on a on a ship, missionary ship. He was doing everything. He was giving himself religiously as he was just literally throwing himself into it. You know why? He was an alcoholic. And he thought if he could just do enough things and get religious enough, he'll get free of this demon. And it never helped him. He went, he just did everything he could. His brother heard our radio broadcast over in Vancouver Island and became a believer. I went over and there was about 20some charismatics and rather Amy's brother and his wife who are over in brother Rogers church Roger Smith's church right now been wonderful believers and they came and he said he said they talked to me about the message he said to brother Ed I could have raised up a thousand arguments in my mind all the arguments came. But he said, "My heart said it's the truth." &gt;&gt; And you know how he really knew it was the truth? He was delivered instantly. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he called up his mom who was over in Vancouver Island. Mom, he said, "I'm free. I'm delivered from alcohol." She said, "Oh." He said, "Come back in six months." Said, "I've heard this before." And he was all down hard. He says, "What do I do, brother Ed?" I says, "Go back in six months." &gt;&gt; He called her in six months, said, "Hi, Mom. I'm still delivered." She says, "Ah, I've seen this and heard this all before." You know, and he come back to me all discouraged. He said, "What I do?" I said, "Go back in a year." &gt;&gt; And he lived that life &gt;&gt; till he walked into eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, others have quit. We're not talking about that. I'm talking about I'm talking about being delivered. &gt;&gt; Other people quit cigarettes or quit this or quit that other hab, but that doesn't mean anything. I'm talking about a man who fought with this all of his life and was delivered by believing something. &gt;&gt; Believing something that his mind was arguing against, but his heart was saying, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; That's what caused Abel to slay the lamb. &gt;&gt; I have to believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you're having as good a time as I am. &gt;&gt; It was a revelation that Abel had &gt;&gt; that it was blood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once we have a true revelation of the I am, &gt;&gt; then we can know who is doing the building. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The God-given revelation of who Christ or the anointed word is in each generation &gt;&gt; is the rock &gt;&gt; on which Jesus Christ is building his church. &gt;&gt; I just read that note because I had to. The way it had come in the message lamb and the dove he said and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail against it. What is it then? The rock that it's built on is a divine revelation of who Jesus Christ is &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it. &gt;&gt; Revelation even amongst the messages very much misunderstood. &gt;&gt; Very much misunderstood. It's more than some mental stimulation. We can get stimulated, but it's more than stimulation. Nothing wrong with stimulation. I get very stimulated, &gt;&gt; but it is more than that. It's more than any physical feeling. &gt;&gt; It's more than something and I have had a lot of people, a lot of people, they were brought up oneness and baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, but still carried a denominational seed. Listen, I want to be very clear with you. That's a very, very dangerous thing. And people hear the message and they say, "Oh, of course." Now, they feel substantiated. They feel strengthened in their resolve to believe the doctrine they've been taught in when in fact uh that had a denomination. If if they if they watch it, they would say that the groups of people that are gathered around the doctrines are and if they go any further or go very further into it, they'll find they'll find that what he taught about how we act and how we conduct ourselves and how we dress etc etc. It starts to run crosscurrent to what those churches so-called believe. &gt;&gt; You understand me? But it's revelation is not oh well now uh we've always believed the oneness. We've always believed baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Revelation will make known Jesus Christ in the scriptures and will glorify him. &gt;&gt; The true revelation of Jesus Christ the we'll call it the logos. And don't get lost when I say that word because the logos I want to just give a quote in a moment. The log go the prophet said was was he said we go back and kind of you know in a drama wee bit and he said there's a little light that proceeds out a little light that appears and it is the logos proceeding out of God. &gt;&gt; God fills all time and space. So it's not an object as such but this lo this light appears this logos because it's it's proceeding out of God &gt;&gt; out of the bosom of the father. &gt;&gt; Jesus said I came out of the bosom of the father. &gt;&gt; So it came out of that resource of God. That love of God. He was the personification of the love of God. That's why he could love men when they spit in his face and pulled his beard out and cursed all kinds of cursings and could say, "Father, forgive them." &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; And this logos came out of the bosom of God &gt;&gt; and he said it was the son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in the scripture they he was called in that time a good man, a great teacher, a good master, a prophet from Nazareth, John the Baptist raised again. Perhaps he's Elias or Jeremas or one of the other prophets or he's the king of the Jews. As Pilate said and wrote over the title at the cross, you're the son of David. Hosanna. And none of those statements put them into the church. &gt;&gt; They did not become part of Christ's building. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus had already told what it is that's required something. &gt;&gt; Even Peter even after that great uh uh revelation which it was &gt;&gt; yet he still slipped from that. &gt;&gt; He did not have the fullness of the Holy Spirit hold that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Jesus knew that even beyond the denial that he made &gt;&gt; and the curses that he made at the time of the cross at the time of the suffering you say it is possible. I'm not making excuses now but it is possible and I want you to remember that and I tried to tell the graduates yesterday. It is possible that a a soldier, a Christian can get bombarded, can find themselves in such a such a place that they that they weaken or maybe even make a denial and and but yet if they're a son of God, they will pick themselves up. &gt;&gt; They will pick themselves up &gt;&gt; from the hog pen &gt;&gt; and something will come within them &gt;&gt; in their debauchery. They'll say, "I'm returning to Father's house." &gt;&gt; Even if you'll just make me a servant, I'm going back to Father's house. &gt;&gt; I want to preach on that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, they had a celebration. &gt;&gt; I just have to hold back. &gt;&gt; But Father didn't say gravel down here in the dirt for a while. Show me that you really mean it. &gt;&gt; You ruined and you spent your entire substance &gt;&gt; down there on all this harlotry and riotous living. And I want to see the proof that you are that you are really repenting. &gt;&gt; No, there was none of that. &gt;&gt; Let us rejoice. &gt;&gt; My son has come home. &gt;&gt; That's the father's heart. That's Jesus teaching. &gt;&gt; That may not be what your preacher teaches or someone else tells you, but that's Jesus teaching. &gt;&gt; I love Jesus teaching. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You made your mistake. Remember this. &gt;&gt; The father had been looking for you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No one else but the father was looking for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have to I have to pull myself back. I'll be preaching on it. It's been burning on my heart. Your elder son, the elder son &gt;&gt; who never did anything wrong. &gt;&gt; Always paid his tithe, always came to church, always worked real hard, lived a clean, pristine life. He wasn't looking for him. &gt;&gt; And when he came back, he didn't even understand the rejoicing. &gt;&gt; It was foreign to him. But if you're away from God, come home. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Come back to Father's house. &gt;&gt; Father's looking for you. &gt;&gt; Father's waiting for you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're waiting to have a feast. &gt;&gt; We're waiting to rejoice over your coming. [Music] [Applause] Peter didn't learn that verse from anybody. &gt;&gt; His father and mother never taught him and the rabbi never taught him. No teacher ever taught him. He never heard it before. &gt;&gt; Amen. But something inside, &gt;&gt; the same thing that was driving Abel out to the field to get a lamb, the same thing was urging Peter to say, "Thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God, &gt;&gt; he said, "Upon this rock, &gt;&gt; I'll build my church." I took some of the messages that the prophet of God spoke in this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want you now to know here's the vindicated vessel. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And it's almost every service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Supernatural. You might be sorry you even came to this service. I'm going to come right to your address &gt;&gt; and put you on notice. And if you haven't heard these, he preaches. He says, "Who do you say this is?" &gt;&gt; Not just a whole group of who do you say &gt;&gt; this is? &gt;&gt; Who do you say I am? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there entire services? Who do you say &gt;&gt; I am? Not the church, but you. &gt;&gt; Who do you say this is? &gt;&gt; Identify it. Say it. Speak it. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When their eyes were opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is this? Who is this Melzdc? &gt;&gt; There's a man here that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; And he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not the little Kuckian, but the God that was in him. &gt;&gt; Looking beyond the suit, looking beyond the grammar. Looking beyond the man and seeing the who he is revealing. none other than Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in this day. &gt;&gt; And when you can recognize that and it becomes a light and a power within you, a force, a passion, &gt;&gt; that's when Jesus Christ can lay his hand upon you and shape you to be built into his church. &gt;&gt; That's the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Yeah. &gt;&gt; A greater than Solomon is here. &gt;&gt; Not a title. &gt;&gt; A declaration. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that one that's greater than Solomon isn't back there 40 years is here. &gt;&gt; Same one is here. &gt;&gt; Waiting for your response. Waiting to see if something is ignited &gt;&gt; within your own soul. &gt;&gt; Say, I can say that. I know who it is. I've heard the voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't say it because the preacher wants me to say it. I don't want to say it because it sounds right. I want to say it because it's a reality. &gt;&gt; The unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be not afraid. &gt;&gt; Amen. And last, &gt;&gt; do you now believe &gt;&gt; I just took a little selection? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You ought to read all the titles &gt;&gt; of the messages. &gt;&gt; Do you now believe? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who do you say this is? &gt;&gt; Do you know who was preaching those services? You know where those titles come from? They didn't come from the school in Kentucky. That's right. &gt;&gt; They came from the divine &gt;&gt; mind of God &gt;&gt; to say this &gt;&gt; presented in this day. Who do you say I am? &gt;&gt; And this is where the flesh and the people get confused. And some say, well, you're leaning towards deity. Not a bit. I'm seeing that it's deity in him and deity in you. &gt;&gt; How can you make it any different? Amen. &gt;&gt; That one that was being revealed is none other than the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when that becomes a reality to you and you can't say anything else, you can't believe anything else, then you are uh uh you're a potential. &gt;&gt; To be built and that's who Jesus was talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing else in this world. A lot of my life has passed, but nothing else in this world means anything to me than to have a witness as the Lord Jesus. That spirit that was in in that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it witness in my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're you are my church. You're part of my church. I put my hand on you. Brother Ben talks about a master stonemason and and and that decisions are just a pile of rocks and those rocks have to be shaped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can say, "I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ." That's fine. That's just a bare starting spot. And that's when God begins to shape you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we all right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And Satan knows well that the revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He knows well and that's what he tries to prevent because he knows it will prevail against his kingdom. &gt;&gt; He talks about and I won't go into it. I have the quotes here and all but he talks about how the priest he learned he learned that it was right. And for those you &gt;&gt; uh young people especially, &gt;&gt; you know, you are in a certain mode of learning. You go to school and you learn things and you're at home and you learn things. How do I do that? And your mother, your father teaches you this is how you do it. Oh, okay. Let me try. And we we we are in in this generation which is a highly educated generation. We learn things and we come to church and we learn things. We learn songs. We learn to sing. We learn the scriptures. We learn things. And we carry that same format into the church. A revelation is not learned. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's not something you learn. If you if you learn it, then someone else can teach you something different &gt;&gt; and you can be talked out of it. &gt;&gt; But a revelation becomes actually part of you &gt;&gt; as much as your entire being. It becomes a part of you. No one can ever argue you out of it. [Music] Now just stay real close for next few moments. Brother Brandon said in the message there is a man here that can turn on a light. He said when you see his word being vindicated or other words made known or in other words made known proved that it is the light of his spoken word &gt;&gt; and without light nothing can live without light. There is no life upon the earth today but what has come by the light of the sun. &gt;&gt; And are you interested in eternal life? Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no eternal life outside of the son of God. &gt;&gt; He is the light. &gt;&gt; Well, we know that as phrase. We know that as is being written in the word of God. That's not what I'm speaking about. I'm speaking about experimentally that you have experienced it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You actually experienced it. And so God confirms his word by manifesting. Now follow me if you can please because I didn't know just how to convey this to you. But God's word is not mere languages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just phonics. What what what brought the revelation to Abel? I don't know. But then when Moses began to speak, he said, "I'll speak through a prophet." When Moses began to speak the word, Moses did not speak our language. I'm not too sure how. And the prophets maybe lived in different areas and spoke differently and their languages was different, but God was saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was still saying exactly the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in the masterpiece that he cannot change his method. &gt;&gt; He refers to Malachi 3, I'm God, I change not. He cannot change his method. &gt;&gt; When he started after the fall of the masterpiece, he started to rebuild his uh rebuild the masterpiece. Follow me very close. I'm got a ways to go yet. And so he starts with Abraham. What's he do? He makes himself known to Abraham. What language says, "And God appeared to him." What did he say? How did he say it? I don't know. Do you know? &gt;&gt; I don't think anybody here knows. But you know, Abraham got the same message. He got the message. &gt;&gt; Whatever language, whatever sound or whatever he saw, he got the message that this is God speaking. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was speaking to him. &gt;&gt; And he got a specific message. I'm going to give you this land. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a son. &gt;&gt; Those are very specific things, aren't they? &gt;&gt; He didn't say it in my language. Didn't say it in your language. I don't know how he said it. So, this is what I want to convey to you. It's essential to convey it to you. It may not be any specific language. God spoke to me. I don't know how he speaks to an individual, but when God speaks, it will surely bring a person into a righteous, holy condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God makes his word known. This is how God makes his and he doesn't change his method. God makes his word known &gt;&gt; by supernatural vindication and by manifest manifesting it or proving that it is his word. That's his method &gt;&gt; and that's what he did in our generation and that's the word that you believe. &gt;&gt; You may have to believe it for years yet. I don't know. We may have the rapture before today is out. I don't know. But people have hung on and believed that since uh since the time of Jesus Christ when they identified who he was and this is this is the method friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus said flesh and blood has not revealed it to you. And that's the method &gt;&gt; when it's revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's so much that's going on. Revelation is an overworked word &gt;&gt; amongst believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Why do you say that? How do you know that?" Well, I'll tell you why. Because I see people drift from it. And you can get to say, "Here's precisely what the message says. Here's precisely what it says." Doesn't mean anything to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I come with a real hard one. &gt;&gt; Are they in the church? &gt;&gt; Are they in the church? &gt;&gt; Here's what the vindicated prophet of God said. Here's what it is. Doesn't mean anything to them. &gt;&gt; I have another feeling. I have another this. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can sing the same songs and and worship and pray and all that doesn't mean anything to me. &gt;&gt; All kinds of people pray. &gt;&gt; I can guarantee them. Most of the people in the message, none that I know of, go to the church every morning and pray specifically that I might enter into the kingdom. Right? &gt;&gt; That's a sincere person. &gt;&gt; You know how long he's been doing it? Years and years. &gt;&gt; Does he tire of it? No, he doesn't tire because he wants to enter the kingdom. &gt;&gt; And I ache in my heart. I pray I I trust that God somehow some way would bring him to a place where uh the there' just be a light turned on within him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here's what God spoke through Moses. But the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name or the preacher which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if thou say in thine heart, how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; How shall we know? How will you know the word that the Lord hath not spoken? &gt;&gt; Amen. When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, &gt;&gt; if it's not vindicated, &gt;&gt; if it's not proven, &gt;&gt; if it's not correct, &gt;&gt; and nor it come to pass, that thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell my brother, my sister, the message has become more important to me at in in this stage of my life than at any other time if he hasn't spoken it. It's not a proven vindicated word. I don't fear it. &gt;&gt; I just don't fear it. &gt;&gt; We're going to do this or we're going to do that or I'm going to go here or I'm going to go I got a plan. You go ahead with your plan. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, you anchor &gt;&gt; Amen. You anchor your entire being &gt;&gt; in what is thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; I was really I was really touched last night. Brother Mark, why I don't see him here this morning. Maybe he's on a camera someplace. Yeah, you're there. And he said he was required by because of his management position I guess he was required to read and study this volume this book on management and leadership. Many of you weren't there last night so you can hear this for the first time. And there was 22 things that were are are guides and requirements for a person to become really in leadership. And he says he had to study. He was required to study all of those things. And when he was finished, he said it was really intense. And when he was done, he read the message leadership. And I appreciate the kind of uh mental ability that he would have. And he took the message leadership and read it and said every one of those 21 or 22 items are included in the message leadership. &gt;&gt; All of those qualities are there. All of those instructions are there. Isn't it incredible? And listen, if you read that, if you read that and let the Holy Spirit make it a reality to you'll get every quality you need for leadership. [Music] Brother Brandham talks about I just want to mention this one who is doing the building. No man hath seen God at any time. The only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father. Notice he was standing on earth when he said who was in the bosom of the father. He hath declared him. In other words, he has made him known. Brother said so he was first God Jehovah and out of him he said let's see uh coming out of space where there's nothing. Let's make a little white light, like a mystic light, like a halo. And that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning. That was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father. That was what was in the beginning was the word. Now, he's going back and just giving us a a little description. That's what it was. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God. Well, he just describes it and gives it in a in in a in a drama form and a little white mystic light comes out and he said that is the logos. That's the word proceeding out of the bosom of the father. &gt;&gt; And he said we'll call it the son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do I have just a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Because this becomes actually I'm actually coming to the part that is so important to me. I believe that God raised up the messenger of this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you notice now I just pray that God will help me to make this and I'll conclude on this part even though I'm not finished. I saw him now because of the message and the way God was dealing with me. I saw now this one we call the Lord Jesus Christ as the builder and according to his own words coming out of his own mouth. When you see the days of Sodom again, which we see. When you see the days of Lot, when you see the days of Noah again, that's when I will be revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30. And we know that God raised up this prophet messenger and through him revealed. Now he's coming. And I I see now it's not just Willie Brham, not him in that in his physical form, but I see that that he's been chosen and gifted and given this office. And it's the Lord Jesus Christ. And he says the angel of the Lord speaking to him if they don't believe the first the first sign I'll make them to believe the second for I'll make you to know the secret of their heart. &gt;&gt; So now I want to come to that part because now the one hang in here the one that he is actually going to make known to the people is the builder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one who said, "I &gt;&gt; Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; That's the I &gt;&gt; I will build my church. &gt;&gt; So now he's coming to a whole masses of people who don't really know who he is. &gt;&gt; And so now he begins to tell them that it's a light. It's the same pillar of fire. And he's explaining it to the people. He says, "It's over this man. It's over this woman." And he begins to reveal the secret of their heart. But many many many many times he says this now follow me. Said I take every spirit &gt;&gt; in this building &gt;&gt; under my control &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; And you know it's well taught in the message every that your spirit has the five channels. And you have the memory. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; that channel can be so &gt;&gt; such a disappointment. &gt;&gt; And the conscience &gt;&gt; where the guilt and all the condemnation can be and the ma and the memory and the conscience and the imagination &gt;&gt; and the reasoning &gt;&gt; and all of these and the affections. I don't know. I can't. I don't think I have the time. But isn't it incredible that God positioned a man says, "I take every spirit &gt;&gt; under my control." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the glory of God. &gt;&gt; He took control of the affections. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He took control of the memory. Took control of those for the glory of God. And I can tell you when when the heart of the secret of the heart begin to be unveiled of the people, they didn't have anything in their mind. They come there, they needed something desperately. And God was on the scene making him known. In other words, God, that's how he began to approach the building stones. &gt;&gt; And there was multitudes that could say, "Hosana, hosana. Oh, this is like Bible days again. This is glorious again." But when the word came and he began to tell them who he is, there wasn't very many saying thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God. &gt;&gt; This is the Messiah. And even told him, this is the sign of the Messiah. This is the last great sign. Are you folks following me? &gt;&gt; That's how close. And that, you know, it was just that fine line that they weren't able to grasp. &gt;&gt; But he it was it was the same. It was the builder and he was approaching the stones. Heaps of stones. Heaps of stones. Baptist stones, Presbyterian stones, Pentecostal stones, Jehovah's Witnesses, the whole works of them. all these stones out there and just one here, one there caught it. &gt;&gt; This is God's prophet &gt;&gt; and begin to listen and begin to see and saw the vindication, the vindication, the proof &gt;&gt; that this was correct. &gt;&gt; That to me means so much. Friends, if this were my last message, this is what I would want to scream out. That vindication is what I have my confidence in &gt;&gt; because that's God. That's not a man. That's not a church. It's not a Bible school. &gt;&gt; It's not a theology. &gt;&gt; You can argue about he said, she said, they said, he did. They did. You can argue that till you're blew in the face. You can't argue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you say you had an operation, you're in the hospital last week. You had an operation. You have cancer. There cancer in the prostate. &gt;&gt; Sister, you have cancer. It's on the breast. It's on your right breast. &gt;&gt; Another one. &gt;&gt; You've had an operation. You've had two. You've had three, four, five. Oh, that poor woman. And they couldn't find it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's real diagnosis. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's going way beyond the doctors. Five operations and they couldn't find it. &gt;&gt; What wisdom is this that can find it? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Just a moment. The devil is trying to hide. Oh, be real reverent. Scanning the congregation. Oh, there it is. &gt;&gt; Epilepsy. &gt;&gt; That's a hard one to handle. You you can hide from the doctors, but you can't hide from God. &gt;&gt; Where was God? &gt;&gt; In the man. &gt;&gt; Was it right? Was it true? I say yes, it was true. &gt;&gt; That's the builder. &gt;&gt; Not William Brandon, the Christ that was being revealed in this day. The one the person of the message &gt;&gt; is the builder. &gt;&gt; And if anybody denies &gt;&gt; the message, I don't have any confidence that they form part &gt;&gt; of his church. &gt;&gt; It's a group people. Brother Bam called them clubs. &gt;&gt; Friends, I don't want to be in a club. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got to know, brother John. I'm in the church. &gt;&gt; There's only one church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Take every spirit under my control. &gt;&gt; He says, "And this gift is to contact &gt;&gt; your spirit." &gt;&gt; He said, "You realize we're dealing with spiritual beings." said, "You have a spirit." &gt;&gt; Every person in this building, regardless of what age you are, you have a spirit, a human spirit that entered your body when you took your first breath. &gt;&gt; And you have a man in a suit like I'm dressed this afternoon. A man, &gt;&gt; I take control of your spirit. I take control of every spirit &gt;&gt; in this building for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Your affections, your emotions, your every part of you. I take control of it. He didn't say, "I take control of your soul." &gt;&gt; Because he was only seeking it was the builder &gt;&gt; trying to get you to bite on the hook. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that he could bring you in &gt;&gt; and start working on you by the word of God. and build you into his church. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I can say with the children that sing the chorus, he's still working on me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why don't we all say that? He's still working on me. &gt;&gt; Now, we should say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he's still working on me. [Applause] God. &gt;&gt; And uh I'm I'm closing with this, but this is so priceless. He said when that and he's talking about taking people taking the spirit under control. He said when I when the blood cell when the blood cell at Calvary broke and he says when that blood cell broke at Calvary not only the life of the human being came back &gt;&gt; but the life of God comes back &gt;&gt; from it and makes you a son and daughter of God. He said in he he he he said another place he said that God making himself tearing out or rooting out all of the evil bringing into submission the flesh the dust that he created and live with you as a partner. &gt;&gt; Oh I love that. He says then the blood cell was broken on Calvary. Not was not an animal neither was it a man. It was God's own blood. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And it comes back and gives a new birth. He said that spirit &gt;&gt; that spirit that comes out of there &gt;&gt; comes into the human spirit &gt;&gt; and makes him a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; I can I will say the blood cell has been broken. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the blood cell at Calvary has been broken. &gt;&gt; The spirit came out from there. That is the Holy Spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And he said it comes into the human spirit. &gt;&gt; And makes you a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you just to think now as we close according to this teaching. I have a spirit. I have a human spirit. But I have believed I trust you can con confess and say that along with me. I have believed the word that God has sent. &gt;&gt; I have believed on him whom he has sent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that word that I believed is none other than the Jesus Christ, the son of God. &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it beyond my understanding. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My dear friends, let the message &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; be your guide. &gt;&gt; It's Christ the person, &gt;&gt; not a book. &gt;&gt; Not just looking at a book for some answers. That's not it. looking to see another aspect of the person. &gt;&gt; This is the person. &gt;&gt; I'm your friend. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you the absolute truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When I have a message book in my hand, I approach it that I might get what the author is trying to say to me. I don't look at brother Brandham as being the author. People talk about brother Brandham breaking the seals. Brother Brandham didn't break the seals. He spoke the bro open seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I see it as a person. &gt;&gt; Not a book of brother Brandham said this and that because he said this that you have to do that. No, I want the person. &gt;&gt; He said it's a person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to think deep. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Who do men say that I am?" &gt;&gt; And Peter finally said, "Thou art the Christ, the son." What son was he talking about? &gt;&gt; He's not talking about the son that was born from Mary. &gt;&gt; You have to watch this close cuz that son died &gt;&gt; and rose again &gt;&gt; by the spirit that was in him. So he's talking about the son of God, the son he couldn't see. &gt;&gt; The son that was made real to him. &gt;&gt; That's the one I look for as I read the messages. And I admonish you. I encourage you when you read that and you take that and you listen to it, you say, "Son of God, &gt;&gt; revealed in this time &gt;&gt; you speak to me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can tell you &gt;&gt; even in the last few months &gt;&gt; the spirit of God has just so guided sometimes cautioned then instructed. I can't take you to the actual quote but I see I I I'll maybe read a quote. Oh, and then &gt;&gt; and then I I circle that then. Then this happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, friends, it it depends what you think this is today. &gt;&gt; Depends who you think this is. I'm not interested in any other church than the church. I'm not interested in this church. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in this church. I'm interested in &gt;&gt; a church of failure. People will fail you. &gt;&gt; But the church of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; it will never fail you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Built upon the church, built upon the rock. &gt;&gt; The declaration, the confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That spirit, and I'm going to just repeat this in my closing comment, that spirit &gt;&gt; that comes out of there, &gt;&gt; which he said was a blood cell. That spirit that comes out of there, that blood cell comes into the human spirit and makes or creates him as a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. This was one of brother Brandham's great I'm not going to I'm not taking this off to speak a lot longer. I'm just taking it off to be more comfortable. You know I lived in the time I sat in the meetings and I heard brother Brandham preaching to the people. Listen to me real close. You couldn't convince those people that that they were not sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You couldn't you couldn't convince them for anything. &gt;&gt; What do you mean? I'm a minister. I'm a preacher. I have a congregation. I have a successful church. And he had the ministers meetings one after the other after the other. And you ought to listen. Go ahead and listen to them on the tape. They're so quiet. You can cut the air with a knife. You go and listen to Godhead explained &gt;&gt; several hundred ministers &gt;&gt; and he's telling them I love it. &gt;&gt; He says he asked him a question. You should listen to it. He asked him a question. Now hang on to your seats. He said was God the father the father of Jesus Christ? And he is real quiet. He says, "Well, surely you know what you believe and you're not ashamed of what you believe." Was God the Father, the Father of Jesus Christ? See, they sensed that it was a trap. And it was. And then he asked him the second time, "Was God the Father the Father of Jesus Christ?" And you hear two or three little squeaks. Amen. You know why? Cuz they were they were afraid. &gt;&gt; He says, "All right, let's turn to Matthew the 2 chapter and begins to tell of the conception of Jesus Christ." And he was conceived of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Wow. He said, "Now we have the second person conceiving the third person." And they were having a problem. Now, here I'm going to I I'm going to bring it really down home. Do you think that they could convince one of those men, ministers of successful churches, that they were not sons of God? I'm not saying they weren't sons of God. But when the word came, when the word was coming, they said, "We speak in tongues and we have all this demonstration, have healings, &gt;&gt; have miracles, have all the manifestations, &gt;&gt; but there's one thing that's lacking, and that is that God can unveil the secret of the heart, doesn't matter what it is, and say it time after time after time, and ask the people public, is that correct? Is that the truth?" And the people said, "It's the truth." Amen. &gt;&gt; Not not just a healing, not just having faith for a certain thing to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I heard him just the other day and he's talking to a man and he said, "You're real nervous." And the reason you're nervous is you're you're a minister, aren't you? Yes, you're a minister. And the reason why you're nervous is you got to get out of here and go to a service. &gt;&gt; You got an appointment you have to go to. Just just relating everything. Is that true? Yeah, it's true. &gt;&gt; 30 years. &gt;&gt; Is that true? You say, "Brother Ed, we've heard you say that so many times." Is that true? That's what you have to anchor your faith in. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. &gt;&gt; We have the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth vindicated the word. &gt;&gt; And then when you hear that, when you see that and it begins to speak to you, say, "You are the Christ, &gt;&gt; not the man." the man that was in the man, the son &gt;&gt; of the living God, &gt;&gt; not the one born from Mary. &gt;&gt; Yet, that was the vessel that God was in. &gt;&gt; And it was Jesus Christ in in a special way because he said, "My flesh is meat indeed, &gt;&gt; and my blood is drink indeed." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham could never say that. &gt;&gt; This was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. born of a virgin and the blood was the blood of God. &gt;&gt; Not Jew, not Gentile, the blood of God. And God's blood was in his a new creation. And that blood cell of the new creation broke and the spirit uh uh departed from that body. And that holy spirit hovered over the earth to bring forth the sons and daughters of God. And when those those who were chosen and elected saw it, they said in each age, that's the son of God. &gt;&gt; That is the Messiah. That's a revealed word in our time. &gt;&gt; And I say to you, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; blessed art thou. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're blessed &gt;&gt; people. Amen. And when you've taken your last breath, and I've taken my last breath here, &gt;&gt; we'll meet in another land, &gt;&gt; in another place. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like I'd like to just sing a little song. I need Brother Derek, can you help me? I'd like to sing a song that a native brother sang in Port El Bernie. And when he got finished singing it, Brother Brandham came out to the pulpit and he said wouldn't be much of a preacher. He couldn't preach after that. I tell you what, it's just glorious. Absolutely glorious. Oh, what a savior. &gt;&gt; What a savior. Would you stand with me and let's sing a verse or two of it? We have the words up, please. Let's just remain, Reverend, for a moment while we glorify him. Oh, what a savior. Oh, what a savior. Oh, hallelujah. His [Music] heart was broken [Music] on his hands were star his [Music] He gave his life forever. Let's sing this verse. Once I was straight. was I was afraid in s no [Music] I see I love this next line. They searched through heaven and they found the savior. Oh hallelujah. To save God soul life. Feel it lifted up now. Oh how a savior. Oh hallelujah. Glor. His heart was broken [Music] on Calary. His hands were nail. He gave his life for me. He left the father [Music] with all his riches [Music] with all the sweet [Music] and down [Music] and gave his My blood to make the highest single. [Music] Oh my savior. Oh hallelu. [Music] His heart was broken. on Calary. His hands were star he gave his life for the king. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a savior. Hallelujah. Our precious Lord Jesus, thank you. How can we thank you? These words are so inadequate. But hear it in the language of our hearts, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hear it in the language that cannot be spoken in our tongue. Oh, we say with the minister, the songwriter, oh for a thousand tongues to declare our savior's praise. Lord, our souls, our souls, oh God, are lifted up to you in thanksgiving &gt;&gt; and we cannot describe, but we ask you, Lord, to look within our hearts &gt;&gt; and see that love and receive it, oh God. Let it be like a sweet incense before you. And I pray that the people here today, Lord, will not have sat in a Sunday morning service hearing a message or sermon. But may there be words of God spoken to them. Touch them. Lord, &gt;&gt; touch each life. Lord, I'm thinking of different ones in the assembly. Oh, Father, speak to them. We've had a graduating class. Oh Lord Jesus, would you guide them? You said that the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth. Guide them, oh God, guide them. And may they be man enough and woman enough to say you are my guide. I will not trust my own mind, my own wisdom. I will not trust any other one, but I'll trust you. You will guide their footsteps right. Oh God, make them a make them a real witness for you. We need witnesses. I pray Lord that this congregation of people will be a a powerful witness of Christ in this time, Lord Jesus. And as we spend a this afternoon and return this evening to hear our brother Bill Ivy, oh God, pastor of many years, brought up, oh father, and he's he's been brought up in the in the faith. Oh Lord, I pray that you'll use his mouth. Speak to me. Speak to us, oh Lord. would say, "Speak my Lord and I will answer." Oh God, &gt;&gt; you'll put words in his mouth for us. &gt;&gt; Bless us this afternoon, Lord. And as we depart this place, may we depart with the peace of God abiding upon us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; I commit these one to you now. Amen. And amen. [Music] Hallelujah. I'm going to dismiss you. We've been a little bit longer than perhaps normal, but if you would be so kind to greet one another and especially the visitors in our in our gates, make them welcome and we dismiss you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.
