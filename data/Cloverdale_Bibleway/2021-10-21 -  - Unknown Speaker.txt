TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and i was thinking about the process of life and actually the growth of human life and what is happening and you have no clue what's going on right like what's going on and so i have a little video just hold just hold it there for a second and i'll take this three minutes because i want you to realize as we just go through this little message tonight a little simple wednesday night that regardless of what you may see or hear or what your five senses here feel something very well could be transpiring you just have no you don't have a sense to see it except your faith accept your faith the sixth sense do not rely on your emotions and your affections and your memories and your your touch and your feeling your hearing all of that because you you're gonna miss the fact and the strength that you actually need knowing by faith it's actually happening but i don't see it happening so we're going to look at an example that this happens so why don't you throw up the video yeah all right so we have a human cell and it's been fertilized and it has just split this is just as fertilization and now the cell is splitting you have no clue this is happening this is like within hours 24 hours actually it begins to divide so this has happened within 24 hours of fertilization and every 12 to 15 hours it continues to divide in about five days there's about 100 cells you're saying what's happening i don't see life coming know what's happening at such a microscopic level you don't know here's about 100 cells and it breaks forth from this coding and this protection it has and these cells now break forth and they implant themselves under the womb and they actually don't just plant themselves there it actually then goes right into the lining of the membrane and now starts to grow continue to grow and the cells now which called is called gastrulation this is what's happening here and it's going to actually now start splitting and there's different layers of the cells that now start to grow and one layer starts to become you'll see in the little little uh video one becomes certain aspects of the body a third the middle layer becomes a certain aspect of the body and a bottom layer becomes a certain aspect of the body showing here lungs this is all happening and you have no clue you have no clue that life is in in formation as we as as you're living and you're like where's the problem where is it but it's happening here now you have a teeny teeny little not even an embryo yet this is his brain cells you can see the brain is still open and all the different cells are being formed and they're reaching out to each other and it's kind of now your organogenesis you're seeing the cells form of blood vessels as vessels and cells start going to their their areas of what their what they're meant to become here's your heart the little little one's heart now beating very early in development he's about at about uh four and a half weeks in or so he's about five a fifth of an inch long in 30 days he's about the size of a red currant and here his little arms now are starting to break forth and butt out from the from the main body organs start to go in place and we have this teeny teeny little aspect of a child that's being formed that's barely even at the at the end of about 60 days they're not even an inch long and a third of an ounce in weight cells start to recede and where it was webbed one time they started to recede and now they're not webbed the cells diminish in certain areas and each cell has a function to play and this teeny little one you say he's like very small it's like this big you have no clue no clue that this is happening [Music] incredible i marvel at life i marvel at it and you see something like this how on earth can someone say there's no god how on earth can someone look at that and see the form who tells those cells to go and be an arm who tells that cell to be a blood vessel and go to the brain and form the brain cells who gives it that intelligence you're telling me evolution it's garbage it's god himself that does that who who is what is the life that gives those cells that unction god god amen and a miracle of life it takes his time and all the while someone says i don't my mama doesn't really feel anything and in the first 30 days she has no clue what's really going on but it's happening there's an appointed time of life it's happening even though you might not see it or feel it but god has it ordained and his purpose will come to pass i want you to take that into your own situation say i don't know if you have a need and i'm not seeing it come to pass but maybe it's just like that little one maybe cell upon cell maybe little arm cells baby little liver cells that little heart starts to pump life is starting to pump just a few weeks deep and some life now is forming and your answer is on the way hallelujah amen
