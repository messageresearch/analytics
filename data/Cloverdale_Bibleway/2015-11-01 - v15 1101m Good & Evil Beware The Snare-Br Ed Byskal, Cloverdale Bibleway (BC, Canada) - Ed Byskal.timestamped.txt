[33:29] We don't have the faith challenge report
[33:32] available for everyone as yet, but it is
[33:35] printed and and uh some have gone down
[33:38] with brother Tim Dodd uh to the
[33:42] ministers. He's having not a minister's
[33:43] meeting, but a young men's meeting and
[33:46] with brother Barry Coffee and and
[33:48] however many gather there. They've had
[33:50] them for a few years. Uh so they're
[33:53] having that and then he will be in
[33:54] Murphy'sboro. But as soon as they're
[33:57] available, you want to have this copy.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Pardon?
[34:03] &gt;&gt; They have. Oh, all right. I know they

[34:19] be sure and get your copy and read it
[34:20] from cover to cover. Wouldn't you rather

[34:31] speaks about the radio broadcast in
[34:35] Uganda and uh pictures of a number of
[34:37] people who have come to the knowledge of

[34:48] in uh Gintall, Manitoba and he's he's
[34:51] been going up and made several trips to
[34:54] Mongolia. So it it it covers the efforts

[35:18] listening to the prayers you were
[35:19] praying and I want to thank you for
[35:21] that. Um I I wanted to catch uh first
[35:25] time I've ever done it. I wanted to run
[35:27] out and uh catch a deacon hopefully and
[35:30] so I could uh put my offering in the
[35:33] offering basket. And uh this also was
[35:37] the first time. Where's Brother David
[35:39] Law? I saw him.
[35:42] Brother David
[35:44] right there. Brother David, why don't
[35:46] you stand up,
[35:48] folks? There's Brother David Laws.
[35:54] Thank you, brother David.
[35:57] Uh because it this this doesn't happen
[35:59] every day, but uh I I came to put my
[36:02] offering in and I got rewarded by seeing
[36:05] brother David coming down the foyer and
[36:07] uh uh we just uh instinctively put our
[36:11] arms out and had a great big hug. And
[36:14] we're going to do that on the other
[36:15] side, brother David.
[36:17] Just before we sit down to the marriage
[36:19] supper.
[36:22] Amen. That was a really wonderful
[36:25] experience. Uh we have too much to say
[36:28] to talk about that. Met also brother
[36:31] Jerry Harter. Where's Brother Jerry?
[36:38] &gt;&gt; All right.
[36:42] Yes.
[36:43] Brother Jerry, you can you can stand
[36:46] now.
[36:53] The way I said it that way was because
[36:56] there was a time not too long ago he had
[36:58] a hard time standing and uh he's uh his
[37:02] hips are well and we're really happy
[37:05] over that. Brother Jerry, God bless you.
[37:08] God bless you.
[37:10] Nice to have brother Aaron and sister
[37:12] Jessica back. Uh I missed you, brother
[37:16] Aaron. My printer is not working.
[37:21] And uh he already knows that, so it
[37:24] wasn't a surprise. Brother John and
[37:26] Sister Sharon, it was nice to have them
[37:29] back. And I think was your father and
[37:32] mom with you?
[37:33] &gt;&gt; They weren't with you. Oh, that's too
[37:35] bad. Anyway, a he text that the
[37:38] hurricane was coming down in Mexico and
[37:41] I was saying, "Well, you don't want to
[37:42] go up in the rapture that way." Anyhow,
[37:46] we have it may be a whirlwind of some
[37:48] sort, but it won't be necessarily one
[37:50] that struck Mexico.
[37:53] uh this this morning I wish to uh
[37:58] provide you with quite a bit of material
[38:01] and there's one person you need to pray
[38:03] for and that is not only for myself but
[38:06] you pray for yourself and pray that God
[38:09] will help you to put everything together
[38:14] in a certain order.
[38:16] Thank you, brother,
[38:19] for the song. Brother Ryan, for the song
[38:22] and everything, and the musicians can
[38:25] have their seats.
[38:27] All right.
[38:29] Uh, I'm going to provide you with uh
[38:33] quite a bit of material and scriptures.
[38:36] And I I I want you to pray and pray
[38:38] earnestly that God will help you to uh
[38:43] that that God will assemble it for you
[38:46] and provide you with that portion of the
[38:50] word that will be eternal. I was
[38:53] thinking uh of the people that have
[38:55] difficulty with brother Brandham and the
[38:59] message.
[39:01] But you know, if I were you or if I were
[39:04] those that may be listening on the
[39:06] internet, I would consider this one
[39:09] thing that
[39:12] the God he was speaking of was pleased
[39:16] to come and be in attendance with him
[39:19] &gt;&gt; while he expressed those thoughts. And
[39:22] if there's any thoughts that uh you
[39:25] might have or that you might tend to
[39:28] have, I would certainly advise and
[39:31] counsel
[39:33] that we come into harmony with what God
[39:37] was not ashamed to come in behind.
[39:41] When he would come in behind and and and
[39:45] confirm those thoughts, you or you might
[39:48] say, "Well, I don't know if he was
[39:49] confirming it." Well, that's fine, too.
[39:51] That's a that's a a justifiable perhaps
[39:56] thought or question. But nevertheless,
[39:59] the fact is that God did come in behind
[40:02] it and did confirm it with supernatural.
[40:06] And if you believe in a supernatural
[40:08] God, I suggest it was best that we agree
[40:11] with what he agreed with and say, "Well,
[40:14] you were not ashamed of this. I better
[40:16] not be ashamed of it. You agreed in the
[40:18] order of what was being said. I think I
[40:20] will better I better I'd be best a agree
[40:23] with the order of it.
[40:26] I want to speak to you today uh Lord
[40:29] willing on
[40:32] good and evil
[40:35] and I have a double a double title and
[40:39] the second part of the title is beware
[40:42] the snare.
[40:46] Uh so if you wish to stand, I'm going to
[40:49] read out of Genesis 2
[40:52] and we will read just three verses and
[40:54] then have prayer and you'll have your
[40:56] seat.
[41:03] H how many don't know what a snare is?
[41:09] Well, that's wonderful. Looks like 100%
[41:11] know what it is.
[41:14] You might not know the snare that
[41:17] uh say the trappers use up north. And I
[41:21] will just say a couple of things about
[41:23] it. They always put a snare in the path
[41:28] or in the way where an animal always
[41:31] goes, where he runs for his food or he
[41:34] goes down to the water or wherever he's
[41:37] got a well marked out pathway which is
[41:40] his regular thing. Uh that's where a
[41:44] snare is laid. A snare is quite often
[41:46] out of fine wire which is not really
[41:48] visible and then it's concealed or
[41:50] veiled or covered over with. So it looks
[41:53] just exactly like it's untouched
[41:57] and uh and that's where a snare is laid.
[42:02] Uh
[42:04] uh I I'll be coming to these points
[42:06] later on and and it may take a a trapper
[42:10] or a fowler which is called he will
[42:13] deliver me from the fowler. Same thing.
[42:17] Uh, it may take a trapper or a or a uh
[42:22] someone laying a snare may take them
[42:24] ever so long to determine where exactly
[42:28] how and then to fit it and lay it. In
[42:32] the scripture, we'll I'm going to read
[42:34] quite a few scriptures. In the
[42:36] scripture, you'll find that sometimes
[42:39] God allowed
[42:42] uh snares allowed the enemy to lay a
[42:45] snare. And to surprise you, God has even
[42:48] laid snares.
[42:50] Uh, and it may take centuries,
[42:54] may take months, may take years to lay
[42:58] the snare, but it only takes a second to
[43:01] snap it.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; And uh, so you want to be mindful of
[43:05] that while we speak about these things.
[43:09] I want to read this scripture. Genesis 2
[43:13] 7-9.
[43:15] And the Lord God formed man of the dust
[43:18] of the ground, and breathed into his
[43:21] nostrils, the breath of life, and man
[43:24] became a living soul. And the Lord God
[43:28] planted a garden eastward in Eden, and
[43:30] there he put the man whom he had formed.
[43:34] And out of the ground made the Lord God
[43:36] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[43:40] the sight and good for food, the tree of
[43:44] life, the tree of life also in the midst
[43:47] of the garden, and the tree of knowledge
[43:50] of good and evil. Let's just pray.
[43:54] Heavenly Father, it's such a glorious
[43:58] and wonderful moment to be gathered with
[44:01] your people and those that have
[44:04] connected and those that are on the
[44:07] internet streaming, those that are
[44:10] gathered in other assemblies and
[44:12] wherever they may be on the earth and it
[44:15] may be in a different time zone, but I
[44:18] pray that the bride of Jesus Christ will
[44:21] be immensely blessed. Oh God, by the
[44:25] word that they hear from the men that
[44:27] you have directed to be there for them.
[44:31] And we hear, Lord, we need to hear your
[44:33] word. Uh we need to have the Holy Ghost.
[44:38] Place it in order and place it in our
[44:40] hearts. Do anchor something, Father,
[44:43] that will be spoken this morning and
[44:45] this evening with Brother John Andes. do
[44:48] anchor something in our hearts, oh God,
[44:51] as you did with myself, Father, as I
[44:53] listened to Brother Tom minister the
[44:56] last service. And and we just thank you,
[44:59] oh God, that we have the message and the
[45:01] messenger. We are we are not ashamed to
[45:05] say we thank you for standing and
[45:08] vindicating and being in full attendance
[45:11] and and demonstrating to us these
[45:13] supernatural things. And thank you for
[45:15] eyesight, Lord, that we're not blinded
[45:18] to these things. So many are, and we
[45:21] don't understand why, but we pray that
[45:24] you will give such clarity of sight,
[45:27] grant determination, and Father,
[45:29] strengthen any weak spot within our
[45:32] lives or testimony. And now anoint is
[45:35] each one, Father, myself, and the people
[45:37] that will listen in the name of Jesus
[45:40] Christ. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[45:55] All right, I have some slides. I'll just
[45:57] going to show the first couple here. If
[45:59] we can dim the lights, please.
[46:05] There are two trees in Eden. Number one,
[46:10] the tree of life and the tree of
[46:13] knowledge of good and evil.
[46:19] The good part in the tree of knowledge
[46:22] did not come from the tree of life.
[46:27] As I'll be dealing with, there are
[46:30] people that are fine, people that are
[46:32] good. There's good qualities. There's
[46:35] good character. There's good.
[46:38] Having hospitals is good. Having
[46:42] all kinds of things in life which are
[46:45] good. But it's not eternal life.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; We want to make that distinction.
[46:55] At this at all this present civilization
[47:00] came excuse the spelling from the tree
[47:02] of knowledge and therefore tends towards
[47:06] death.
[47:10] Only the Holy Spirit of God
[47:16] only the Holy Spirit of God can discern
[47:18] between the good and the evil.
[47:25] Good things very often develop into a
[47:28] snare unless a person is under the
[47:31] leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; A snare can be a long time in the
[47:38] preparation
[47:40] but suddenly trips at some point.
[47:47] I would like to also read some
[47:50] scriptures
[47:54] and have you read them with me.
[48:01] Thou shalt not these are just various
[48:03] scriptures throughout the scripture. I
[48:05] want I throughout the Bible. I want to
[48:07] leave these uh give these to you as bit
[48:11] of a foundation that we might draw on
[48:13] and some things I want you to notice.
[48:16] Thou shalt not bow down to their gods.
[48:20] They're not our gods.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Never were our gods.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; It's their gods.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; But what God is speaking to his people
[48:28] is we don't bow down. And when you you
[48:33] you're not going to rid the country.
[48:34] You're not going to rid the population
[48:37] of their gods because they have the
[48:40] things. But you will not fall down or
[48:43] bow down to their gods, nor serve them,
[48:46] nor do after their works, but thou shalt
[48:50] utterly overthrow them and uh quite
[48:53] break down their images.
[48:57] They shall not dwell in thy land, lest
[49:00] they make thee sin against me. For if
[49:05] thou serve their gods, it will surely be
[49:08] a snare unto thee. Brother Brandham's
[49:10] ministry actually broke on the scene in
[49:12] what is commonly known as the um
[49:19] charismatic movement.
[49:22] How many have heard of the charismatic
[49:24] movement?
[49:27] Raise your hands once more all over.
[49:29] Good. Charismatic movement was when
[49:32] walls of denominationalism began to go
[49:34] down. And brother Brown speaks about
[49:37] even uh the pre his appreciation for the
[49:39] Christian businessmen international the
[49:41] Christian businessmen because they they
[49:45] disregarded any walls of
[49:47] denominationalism and people gathered
[49:49] and and brother Brandham was often with
[49:51] groups and people on the platform that
[49:54] were from all different you know shades
[49:57] of of denominationalism.
[49:59] and he appreciated that. uh but on the
[50:03] other hand there was a huge
[50:05] uh shall I say frailty amongst the
[50:09] people and that was that people who had
[50:11] a say a high standard of holiness and so
[50:16] on then they begin to see oh all these
[50:19] people are accepted they're coming in
[50:21] they're speaking in tongues and they're
[50:25] worshiping they're singing the same
[50:26] chourses and we all worship together and
[50:28] so on so forth that never I won't say it
[50:32] never, but it did not tend to lift
[50:35] those from, shall I say, lower spiritual
[50:39] experiences to a higher experience.
[50:42] Rather, it took those those that were uh
[50:46] of of, you know, maybe very very strict
[50:49] churches, etc., etc., if they didn't
[50:52] have it in their heart, they quickly
[50:54] went down. And and I saw that. I saw it
[50:58] myself. In fact is I I was in a church
[51:01] in Toronto and we just went there
[51:03] because it was one where things were
[51:05] really happening etc etc and when I came
[51:08] to the church there two of the ministers
[51:11] were standing on the on the backst step
[51:13] having a cigarette and uh I didn't know
[51:17] what was going to happen so I went in
[51:19] had some fellowship in the area and then
[51:20] we went into the sanctuary and those two
[51:23] men got up to give the people communion
[51:27] and I just said to my wife I said,
[51:28] "These men will never give me the Lord's
[51:30] table."
[51:32] And I said, "I'm going to walk out of
[51:34] here." And all five of us got up and
[51:36] walked out in the midst of their
[51:38] communion. And uh uh whatever it meant
[51:42] to them, that's between them and God.
[51:45] But I that was the end of it for myself.
[51:48] And I I was really startled that I
[51:50] people that I knew had such a a godly
[51:54] conviction. And then they saw, oh, you
[51:56] know, the women they they've gone back
[51:59] to their they I guess I can go back to
[52:02] my paint and my Max Factor and all of
[52:05] these things because God's accepting
[52:08] them. And that was a huge failing.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Thou they shall not dwell in thy land.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Lest they make thee sin against me. For
[52:23] if thou serve their gods, it will surely
[52:26] be a snare unto thee,
[52:30] and thou shalt consume all the people
[52:33] which the Lord thy God shall deliver
[52:35] thee, uh shall deliver thee. Thine eye
[52:38] shall have no pity upon them, neither
[52:41] shalt thou serve their gods, for that
[52:44] will be a snare unto thee.
[52:49] Wherefore I also said, I will not drive
[52:52] them out from before you, but they shall
[52:56] be as thorns in your sides, and their
[52:58] gods shall be a snare unto you. That was
[53:01] into into Judges the second chapter.
[53:05] And Gideon made an Ephod, Ephod thereof,
[53:10] and put it in his city, even in Ofra,
[53:14] and all Israel went thither a whuring
[53:18] after it, which thing became a snare
[53:21] unto Gideon and to his house. I just
[53:24] want to stop there for a moment. I would
[53:26] not have spoke I would not have even
[53:28] stopped here except last night we had
[53:32] just a quick invitation and we had to be
[53:36] ready in about 30 minutes and brother
[53:39] Mark and Sister Rachel Matul asked us if
[53:42] we'd like to just go out and have a bite
[53:44] and it was really wonderful and while we
[53:46] were speaking they said you know we've
[53:47] been reading in Joshua and then we
[53:50] finished Joshua and we went on into
[53:52] Judges and I thought oh boy I've been
[53:55] into Judge es and uh so I just thought
[53:58] I'd just let them talk about it and then
[54:00] they got into Judges and they said and
[54:02] then we we I said did you get to Gideon?
[54:05] Oh yes, that's where we are right now.
[54:08] And so I went to this scripture here and
[54:11] that Gideon made an ephon. She says well
[54:13] that's what we were just reading said
[54:14] Rachel. That's just what we were
[54:16] reading. So I thought well maybe I will
[54:19] say something about it because in in
[54:22] Gideon as you know Gideon was a mighty
[54:25] man of valor and he was visited by the
[54:28] angel of the Lord and uh and he he chose
[54:33] uh some men to go fighting with them.
[54:36] And he was he was the one that had
[54:38] incredible victories for God. And he was
[54:41] the one that went with 300 men and had
[54:44] them and defeated the Midianites. And
[54:47] when he had done that, after he had
[54:49] defeated the Midianites, they came back
[54:52] and all the people rejoicing and so on.
[54:54] So the people rose up and said, "We want
[54:57] you to be over us and your son after you
[55:03] and your household after you." They were
[55:06] so enthralled with this huge victory
[55:10] that was wrought by Gideon and his
[55:12] faith. And he said, "I will not rule
[55:16] over you and my son will not rule over
[55:20] you and my household will not rule over
[55:24] you. The Lord will rule over you."
[55:27] And then he said, "But I'll ask you,
[55:29] I'll make a request." And that's what he
[55:31] says. I request of you one thing. That
[55:35] is the the people that you take the
[55:38] earrings because the men wore earrings
[55:41] and you'll take the gold earrings from
[55:44] the prey, those that you have defeated
[55:47] and you break off those earrings. And
[55:49] the Bible says they spread out cloth and
[55:52] robes and uh they and and the people
[55:55] said, "Oh, they would willingly happily
[55:58] do that." And they broke off the
[56:00] earrings from their prey, their
[56:02] captives, and and threw them down also
[56:06] the great necklaces that were on the
[56:09] camels. And the war royal robes of the
[56:12] kings and princes, and they threw it all
[56:15] down, and the weight of the gold was
[56:18] 1,700
[56:20] shekels. And I that then then
[56:25] Gideon took that and make made an aphod.
[56:29] Now an ephod in the Old Testament in the
[56:32] in Exodus and so on, the ephod was a
[56:36] magnificent shoulder type of garment
[56:40] that came over the shoulders of the
[56:42] priests and it had precious stones in it
[56:44] and so on and sometime was made out of
[56:46] gold thread and so on so forth. There's
[56:49] a difference of opinion uh as to what
[56:52] this ephod was. I couldn't find anything
[56:54] that brother Brandham said specifically
[56:56] about it other than that they were
[56:58] usually a robe. But this ephod must have
[57:01] been the thought is that this ephod must
[57:03] have been a an object or an idol of some
[57:07] sort or something because and he placed
[57:10] it in his city and the bible says the
[57:13] people came a whuring after it. Now he
[57:16] wouldn't rule over the people and his
[57:19] household. He said, "My household shall
[57:21] not rule over you. God shall rule over
[57:23] you." So the but the people came bowing
[57:26] to this and giving whatever kind of
[57:29] attentional and o obesence to it and uh
[57:34] and uh and and it was a a they were
[57:37] committing like an harlotry adultery
[57:40] with this thing. They were just giving
[57:42] it such a place in there and it became a
[57:44] snare. It became a snare because it took
[57:47] him away from God. And after that uh
[57:51] Gideon was he had a big family. He had
[57:54] 70 sons and he had one by a concubine.
[57:58] And the one that raised up by the
[58:00] concubine actually up as as soon as
[58:04] Gideon had passed away, the son that he
[58:08] had had by a concubine, he raised up and
[58:12] he went to his people, his mother's
[58:15] family and so on, and said, you know,
[58:17] we're brethren and so on. If you
[58:19] strengthen me, I want to go and slay the
[58:23] sons of Gideon. And the thing certainly
[58:25] became a huge snare because the very
[58:30] you know from then on they just had
[58:32] terrible turmoil.
[58:34] So so the fact the lesson here is that
[58:36] the fact that you know God does great
[58:40] things for a person and and opens our
[58:43] eyes and we have great victories and so
[58:46] on so forth. Don't ever forget we still
[58:48] need the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[58:51] We cannot that's where it takes the Holy
[58:54] Spirit to guide an individual
[58:58] so that we have that leadership of the
[59:01] Holy Spirit so we don't allow something
[59:03] to become a snare to us or to our
[59:06] families or to our church or whatever
[59:08] more. Now I'm not dwelling I'm not
[59:11] dwelling so much on that even though it
[59:13] will sound that way.
[59:16] Surely he shall deliver thee from the
[59:18] snare of the fowler and from the noisome
[59:21] pestilence, David said, and he certainly
[59:24] knew what that was all about.
[59:27] Heaven and earth shall pass away, Jesus
[59:29] said, but my words shall not pass away.
[59:34] And take heed, this is the next verse,
[59:37] and take heed to yourselves, lest at any
[59:40] time your hearts be overcharged or
[59:43] overweighted.
[59:45] overcharged, overweighted with
[59:47] surfetting
[59:49] and drunkenness and cares of this life.
[59:54] And so that day come upon you unawares.
[59:57] Now I know that surfeting and
[1:00:00] drunkenness is not a problem amongst
[1:00:03] believers but the cares of life
[1:00:05] certainly is
[1:00:07] and there isn't anyone. So these things
[1:00:10] certainly fit into uh uh our realm and
[1:00:14] I'm going to try to make it very uh much
[1:00:17] alive into where we live today and and
[1:00:21] surfing and drunkenness and cares of
[1:00:23] this life. So and so that day come upon
[1:00:27] you unawares or suddenly.
[1:00:31] And the Bible says, "For as a snare
[1:00:35] shall it come on all them that dwell on
[1:00:39] the face of the whole earth."
[1:00:42] You know, the first computer, for
[1:00:44] example, and this is this will bring it
[1:00:46] right up to date. first computer I s saw
[1:00:49] a picture of it on Google and the thing
[1:00:52] looks like uh the they said it had about
[1:00:55] the intelligence and calculating ability
[1:00:57] of a brick
[1:01:00] and that was about it and uh the only
[1:01:03] thing I could recognize was some white
[1:01:05] keys on it and uh the first computer
[1:01:08] actually took up two entire floors I
[1:01:10] think of the Empire State Empire State
[1:01:12] Building in New York and it was made for
[1:01:15] military purposes That's what computers
[1:01:17] were originally made for, for for
[1:01:21] computer purposes. And it wasn't too too
[1:01:25] too too long ago that people never
[1:01:28] dreamed that they would be uh uh you
[1:01:31] know, you using one. But not only are
[1:01:34] you using one, children are using them.
[1:01:37] Your children are using them. All kinds
[1:01:39] of people.
[1:01:42] Were they good or are they good? Well,
[1:01:45] yeah, there are they are
[1:01:48] there is a
[1:01:51] you know I use one all the time. I use
[1:01:54] it to study.
[1:01:56] I am very very at the same time I'm very
[1:01:59] aware that Satan has certainly taken a
[1:02:02] hold of it and has captivated minds and
[1:02:06] people are tapping all kinds of things
[1:02:08] and all kinds of messages. It is uh it's
[1:02:12] a very evil device.
[1:02:15] It is also a very huge time waster.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to say amen, go ahead.
[1:02:24] And and it is a valuable device.
[1:02:27] I'm happy I can go online and and book a
[1:02:31] flight and go on a jet, which has been
[1:02:34] all of these things actually came from
[1:02:36] the tree of knowledge.
[1:02:39] Civilization
[1:02:41] as we know it has come from the tree of
[1:02:43] knowledge.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; I wrote some things down at random.
[1:02:48] Uh
[1:02:50] the world the system of civilization
[1:02:54] uh what science and civilization have in
[1:02:59] store for you. Brother Brham asked what
[1:03:01] does science and civilization have in
[1:03:04] store for you?
[1:03:06] And he said, "More death."
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Uh, that's in things that are to be,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; things that seemingly we so enjoy. And I
[1:03:15] will read this quote a little later on.
[1:03:18] Things that seemingly we so enjoy
[1:03:23] and things that seem so needful. I have
[1:03:26] added civilization
[1:03:29] inventions
[1:03:31] uh and but civilization increases in
[1:03:35] pressures and softness of life.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Is it true?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Civilization has moved things and
[1:03:42] science has formed or fashioned designed
[1:03:48] that is a refinement and the refinement
[1:03:51] becomes a trap.
[1:03:54] You don't believe that or do you?
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Very few saw or put this put their hands
[1:04:03] on uh the first computer I have put
[1:04:06] here. Today everyone has one can tap out
[1:04:10] a text can do formulas
[1:04:13] in Excel etc. Uh makes younger people
[1:04:17] wise.
[1:04:19] The world is in a The world is in a
[1:04:21] trap. That's is that's in the Greek word
[1:04:25] for it for snare. Setting the trap or
[1:04:29] the snare may take uh but it's it may
[1:04:33] take a long time but it snaps suddenly
[1:04:35] and the world will develop something by
[1:04:38] science so needful and so attractive, so
[1:04:42] helpful and so timesaving,
[1:04:46] laborsaving.
[1:04:47] Yet the element of death is veiled
[1:04:50] behind the veil of its beauty.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; I believe that's true.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; I believe that was inspired.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; God also has taken years and even
[1:05:04] centuries to bring a savior attribute
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; and then he came suddenly to his temple
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; and he caught the people in a trap.
[1:05:17] He caught them right where they were
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; and then they the trap was they had to
[1:05:23] deal with it
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; and the world just moved along and moved
[1:05:28] along moved along and suddenly came the
[1:05:31] seventh messenger
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; and broke on the scene and with with
[1:05:36] incredible things that were indisputable
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; they had to be glad
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; and when you hold a child and it's all
[1:05:44] crippled up and then it begins to crack
[1:05:47] and the bones begin to straighten out
[1:05:49] and the child becomes absolutely whole
[1:05:52] right there in front of the people.
[1:05:54] Who's going to deny that?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; And did it take a long time coming? No.
[1:05:58] It it just suddenly but the but the
[1:06:02] Christians or the believers or the
[1:06:05] whatever on Plymouth Rock, the early
[1:06:07] fathers that landed on Plymouth Rock or
[1:06:10] or arrived, they came for they came for
[1:06:13] Christian liberty. But now look how
[1:06:16] things had developed until and God laid
[1:06:18] a trap really for America and snap.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; And here it is.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Now you have to make a decision.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Is it of God or isn't it of God?
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; And I've even said to people who want to
[1:06:31] be real doubters and find all kinds of
[1:06:34] problem. I said, "Well, look, look, be a
[1:06:36] real be a real man. Be a just say it's
[1:06:39] of the devil."
[1:06:41] No, no. Oh, no. They don't want to do
[1:06:43] that. Well, then what kind of person are
[1:06:45] you? It's either of God or it's not of
[1:06:47] God. If it's not of God, it's of the
[1:06:50] devil.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; No, they don't want to go that far. Then
[1:06:54] then the person should say it's of God.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Can't be halfway in. It's not It's not a
[1:07:00] mix between the tree of knowledge and
[1:07:02] the tree of life. The tree of life is
[1:07:04] Christ.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:07:16] For the day of the Lord will come
[1:07:18] suddenly
[1:07:20] and it will come as a snare upon all.
[1:07:26] I was reading where brother Brandham
[1:07:28] talked about the world council of
[1:07:30] churches and how they would swallow up
[1:07:34] the churches. When he was saying that
[1:07:37] they had very few members. The first
[1:07:39] meeting of the World Council of Churches
[1:07:40] was in 1948.
[1:07:42] It's a very significant year. The
[1:07:45] message was just breaking on the scene
[1:07:47] also at the same time while they were
[1:07:49] forming. How how perfect that is. And so
[1:07:52] I thought I would just, you know, go
[1:07:54] once on the on on Google and search out
[1:07:58] how many members they have uh today.
[1:08:01] When he when he was speaking that there
[1:08:03] was very few, but he said they're going
[1:08:05] to swallow up the world.
[1:08:08] These are the members. Page one
[1:08:12] that goes from A to S to C rather C to
[1:08:17] E.
[1:08:19] These are two columns on every page.
[1:08:23] All member. These are not churches.
[1:08:25] These are member groups.
[1:08:33] that goes to pee
[1:08:37] several hundreds of them
[1:08:39] and a man stands on the platform and
[1:08:42] says they'll all go there
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; and I can tell you as I stand here
[1:08:47] they're about there
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; and the same voice says
[1:08:55] repeating the words of Jesus and as a
[1:08:57] snare it'll come upon the whole world
[1:09:00] you thankful
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; for a message to prepare our hearts
[1:09:06] and to caution us and that is different
[1:09:09] from the world. Aren't you thankful for
[1:09:10] something that's different from the
[1:09:12] world? I know that you are.
[1:09:16] God bless you.
[1:09:18] Now, I like to just carry on. Please,
[1:09:21] I'll be saying some of the same things.
[1:09:25] The uh you can take those off the slide
[1:09:28] now, please.
[1:09:36] And out of the ground made the Lord God
[1:09:38] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[1:09:42] the sight and good for food and the tree
[1:09:45] of life also in the midst of the garden
[1:09:47] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:09:49] evil.
[1:09:51] And uh I would like to just continue on
[1:09:54] to say that our civilization and
[1:09:57] standard of life that we enjoy is the
[1:10:00] product of the tree of knowledge of good
[1:10:02] and evil.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; We we're going to go out of the church.
[1:10:06] We're going to get in our cars. We're
[1:10:09] going to turn on the heater on or
[1:10:10] whatever
[1:10:12] uh defrost button and we're just you
[1:10:15] know this. It's so much a part of life.
[1:10:18] It is so infiltrated and and I will I
[1:10:22] would like to add this and I may not be
[1:10:25] able to make it as clear as I would like
[1:10:27] to but the good
[1:10:30] we need a a person needs the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:36] We need the Holy Spirit each day in our
[1:10:40] lives
[1:10:42] because what what what where the good
[1:10:45] begins to merge into evil,
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; we need the sensitivity of the Holy
[1:10:51] Spirit right there to know a job is
[1:10:54] good.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; A job can become a trap.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; An education is good. And we may go in
[1:11:02] education for years. Education is good.
[1:11:05] But it will give you a better job,
[1:11:07] better position, whatever more. But an
[1:11:09] education can also be a huge trap.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Uh let not the gods of the world be our
[1:11:19] gods.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; They have nothing to do with us.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; That's their gods.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; They serve them. all the pleasure and
[1:11:27] all the uh whether the sports world and
[1:11:30] the entertainment world and and uh I
[1:11:33] wanted to find out a few things about
[1:11:35] the good life.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; You know America is identified with the
[1:11:43] good life.
[1:11:46] uh that term is actually attributed to
[1:11:50] Aristotle
[1:11:52] who was be he was born before Christ.
[1:11:56] Uh the good life a philosopher a
[1:12:00] philosophical term for the life that one
[1:12:04] would like to live originally associated
[1:12:07] with Aristotle.
[1:12:10] Aristotle's philosophy
[1:12:12] not only provided man with a system of
[1:12:15] reasoning
[1:12:17] but also touched upon ethics. He
[1:12:20] prescribed a moral code of conduct for
[1:12:24] what he called good living. He asserted
[1:12:28] that good living to some degree
[1:12:31] defied the more restrictive laws of
[1:12:34] logic since the real world poses
[1:12:38] circumstances
[1:12:40] poses circumstances that can present a
[1:12:42] conflict of personal values. I'm not
[1:12:45] going to bore you just two three more
[1:12:48] lines.
[1:12:50] That said, it was up to the individual
[1:12:53] to reason cautiously
[1:12:55] while developing his or her
[1:12:59] own judgment.
[1:13:01] That's a winner.
[1:13:08] Then I just went to the end of the
[1:13:10] article. I wanted to know his death and
[1:13:12] legacy
[1:13:16] in 3:22 BC.
[1:13:19] just a year after he fled to a a city in
[1:13:24] Greece on an island to escape
[1:13:26] prosecution under charges of impiiety.
[1:13:30] And I searched to find out what his act
[1:13:32] of impiiety was, but it's I couldn't
[1:13:36] find where it was recorded. Aristotle
[1:13:39] contracted a disease of the digestive
[1:13:42] organs and died. That's the end of it.
[1:13:47] uh
[1:13:49] the 20th century.
[1:13:52] The 20th century
[1:13:55] in human history, now we're up to in
[1:13:58] more to our time, was dominated by World
[1:14:02] War I and World War II,
[1:14:06] nationalism
[1:14:08] and decolonization,
[1:14:10] the Cold War and the postcold war
[1:14:13] conflicts con uh cultural homogeniz
[1:14:17] homogenization
[1:14:19] through developments in transportation
[1:14:22] and communication. You know what?
[1:14:24] There's something good. I'm I'm sure
[1:14:26] that it's not going to be very long
[1:14:28] before one of you pick up a phone.
[1:14:31] Is it bad?
[1:14:34] Could be.
[1:14:36] What if we say, "Well, it's good." Well,
[1:14:38] where does the good end?
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; And where does the evil begin?
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; You're going to need the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:47] There's no way that you can sort that
[1:14:49] out
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; outside of that
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; and technology and world population
[1:14:55] growth, awareness of environmental
[1:14:58] degradation and the birth of the digital
[1:15:01] revolution.
[1:15:02] Uh it saw great advances in
[1:15:05] communication and medical technology
[1:15:08] that by the late 1980s
[1:15:11] de uh uh allowed for near instantaneous
[1:15:15] worldwide computer communication and
[1:15:18] genetic moda modification of life.
[1:15:22] And we're told that both civilization
[1:15:26] and culture are modern words. The two
[1:15:29] words are derived from ancient Latin.
[1:15:33] The word civilization is based on the
[1:15:36] Latin civus or inhabited in a city.
[1:15:43] Don't look at me like that
[1:15:46] cuz most of you live in some kind of a
[1:15:48] city or gathering.
[1:15:52] It says that this civilization
[1:15:55] in its most essential meaning meaning is
[1:15:59] the ability of people to live together
[1:16:01] harmoniously in cities or in social
[1:16:05] groups.
[1:16:07] And yet this civilization that we're in,
[1:16:10] I have a article here that says in the
[1:16:14] 20th century more people died.
[1:16:20] More people died
[1:16:23] in the 20th century than all the history
[1:16:26] of man
[1:16:28] put together.
[1:16:30] And you have a prophet standing and
[1:16:32] saying
[1:16:34] this civilization is death.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; And you could just sense people raise up
[1:16:39] and they don't like to hear that. That
[1:16:41] happens to be the truth.
[1:16:43] no matter how associated, no matter how
[1:16:45] much in love we are with uh you know
[1:16:48] whatever whatever and and and and I
[1:16:51] literally have dealt with people who
[1:16:53] worship the God of education
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; and yet we're not against education
[1:16:58] because brother Benam would say and I
[1:17:00] will certainly say as well uh we we're
[1:17:03] not here in support of ignorance.
[1:17:06] We have a school and we're so thankful
[1:17:09] for Holy Ghost people
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; that would give their lives and we're
[1:17:13] thankful for those that have home
[1:17:15] homeschooled and do homeschool. Uh I was
[1:17:19] thinking of the uh brother and sister
[1:17:21] Haynes. Uh God bless you. You raised a
[1:17:25] wonderful family and uh and I understand
[1:17:28] sister Haynes is homeschooled. I have
[1:17:30] not spoken to her directly about it but
[1:17:33] I believe that they have. I understand
[1:17:35] that brother Andy's son and his wife uh
[1:17:39] have a whole group, a homeschooling
[1:17:42] group that have gathered, you know, have
[1:17:45] some association together. And uh what
[1:17:49] what are people trying to do? They're
[1:17:51] trying to make their way through this
[1:17:54] civilization and hold a good standard.
[1:17:57] And we're not just talking about a good
[1:17:59] standard. Remember that is as good as it
[1:18:02] can be. It did not come from the tree of
[1:18:04] life.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; This message came from the tree of life.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life, it came from
[1:18:14] the tree of life.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't got it, I would toss
[1:18:19] everything aside to gain eternal life.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; As a young man said to Jesus, "What good
[1:18:28] thing must I do to inherit eternal
[1:18:30] life?" And the Bible says Jesus loved
[1:18:32] him.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; He come running to the master. What good
[1:18:36] thing must I do to inherit eternal life?
[1:18:39] You do this, this, this, and obey the do
[1:18:42] the commandments. All of these have I
[1:18:43] done. And yet what lack I sell all thou
[1:18:47] hast and give it to the poor. And he
[1:18:49] went away saddened because he had and
[1:18:52] brother Brandham says he turned down
[1:18:53] eternal life.
[1:18:57] A woman
[1:18:59] who perhaps you wouldn't want as your
[1:19:01] neighbor
[1:19:02] came to a well and met a man.
[1:19:08] And this woman did not have a good
[1:19:09] record in this community.
[1:19:14] She'd gone through five marriages
[1:19:17] and now was living with another that was
[1:19:20] not her husband.
[1:19:24] and she meets a man.
[1:19:27] But the one thing I want to take I could
[1:19:29] I you you can read it and you know it
[1:19:31] very well yourself. And here God himself
[1:19:33] directs a messenger in support of his
[1:19:36] own message to that very woman
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; and began to speak to her and she had
[1:19:43] questions. We all have questions.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; And he had she had questions about
[1:19:48] worship. But he first he took the three
[1:19:50] steps through the body and the spirit
[1:19:53] realm and the soul.
[1:19:56] And then he said, "Give me a drink
[1:19:59] just for the body." That's as far as
[1:20:02] that goes.
[1:20:04] And she says, "What relationship should
[1:20:06] we be having? The Jews don't have any
[1:20:09] communication with the Samaritans." And
[1:20:12] she was a Samaritan.
[1:20:14] He said, "But if you knew who I was,
[1:20:16] you'd ask me for a drink." and she's
[1:20:18] still just using the natural well the
[1:20:21] well is deep and you don't have anything
[1:20:23] to draw with and you know and he said if
[1:20:26] you knew who it was you'd ask me for a
[1:20:28] drink I give you a wa I give you water
[1:20:30] you'll never thirst again
[1:20:33] and she's still into this water here how
[1:20:35] will you give me Jacob our father Jacob
[1:20:38] drank of this well and so on
[1:20:42] and he said you'd never thirst again she
[1:20:44] said sir g give me this water. And
[1:20:48] that's what brother Brandham says to us.
[1:20:50] Live salty.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Live salty and make your friends, make
[1:20:55] your unsaved family thirsty.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Just by your life.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; He wasn't there thundering out a big
[1:21:01] message to her.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; He was just living a life and telling
[1:21:05] her what it was he possessed. She said,
[1:21:09] "Give me this water." and she still is
[1:21:12] in the naturals that I never I I I don't
[1:21:14] have to come back here to draw. That
[1:21:16] wasn't it. And he ignored it.
[1:21:21] He said, "Go and get your husband."
[1:21:24] That was the key.
[1:21:26] I'm sure her eyes flashed because he
[1:21:30] just like a dagger went right to her
[1:21:33] problem.
[1:21:35] Sir, I perceive that you're a prophet.
[1:21:40] That was good. Not far enough.
[1:21:44] He said, "Go and get your husband." She
[1:21:46] said, he said, "In that you have said is
[1:21:48] true,
[1:21:51] and who you have now is not your
[1:21:52] husband."
[1:21:54] Who who which one of you would want her
[1:21:57] as your neighbor?
[1:22:00] But here's the Messiah himself
[1:22:02] desiring
[1:22:05] not this woman, but that eternal seed
[1:22:07] that was in her. Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; And he was moving from the spirit. Now
[1:22:12] he's in the spirit. She said, "The Jews
[1:22:15] say we should worship in Jerusalem and
[1:22:17] the Samaritans say we should worship in
[1:22:19] this mountain." And she just came up
[1:22:21] with the confusion. There's all kinds of
[1:22:22] confusion in this world. How many people
[1:22:24] in the churches? All kinds of confusion.
[1:22:26] This is what they believe and this is
[1:22:28] what they believe and this is what
[1:22:29] somebody else believes.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; We have nothing to do with that.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; It's way beyond that. This message is
[1:22:36] way beyond that.
[1:22:39] And
[1:22:41] she said, "I know when the Messiah
[1:22:42] comes, he'll tell us all things."
[1:22:46] And he said, "I that speak to them, he'"
[1:22:49] He didn't have to explain a whole bunch
[1:22:51] of things and prove a whole bunch of
[1:22:53] things. She dropped her water pot, ran
[1:22:55] into a city, said, "Is this not the
[1:22:58] Messiah?
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Is this the Messiah?" The priests
[1:23:02] couldn't catch it.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; The priests couldn't catch it. the
[1:23:05] Sadducees and the Pharisees couldn't
[1:23:07] catch it. But here is a woman that that
[1:23:10] we in the natural would think really
[1:23:13] really has uh uh
[1:23:17] has failed in natural life.
[1:23:21] But I tell you what, in eternal life,
[1:23:23] she didn't fail.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't this the Messiah?
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; And friends, today this message, isn't
[1:23:31] this Messiah? Isn't this Messiah who
[1:23:33] reveals the secret of your heart? Isn't
[1:23:35] this Messiah? Is this just some books?
[1:23:38] Is this just some translations or
[1:23:41] transcriptions that have been
[1:23:43] transcribed? Or is it something more?
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, is it something more?
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; To me, it's been Messiah. And I thought
[1:23:51] today I'll stand here and declare to you
[1:23:53] who I believe this is.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; This is Messiah.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And many want to say, "Well, I think
[1:24:04] that that's gone too far." Well, that's
[1:24:06] very fine. That's very fine. Go where
[1:24:09] you wish to go with it. But as far as
[1:24:12] I'm concerned, the woman at the well,
[1:24:15] she wouldn't have got what she got. And
[1:24:18] the and the prophet of God speaks about
[1:24:19] her and said she was elected and she had
[1:24:22] that predestinated seed. and the and and
[1:24:25] and when and when the priest was
[1:24:27] confronted with it, he said Belub.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; When she was confronted with it, she
[1:24:32] said Messiah.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; That's the difference, friends.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; There's no gray space here.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; It's either Belub or Messiah.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; I say that word,
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; that word that God vindicated, the
[1:24:46] author of life,
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; that has to be that has to be Messiah.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; He has sent a word to catch you.
[1:24:53] Hallelujah.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Said an Ephesian church age ever keep in
[1:25:01] mind and I'm going to try to be I'm not
[1:25:06] going to be long long. I'm going to go
[1:25:08] as far as I can and then just stop.
[1:25:11] Ever keep in mind that religion
[1:25:15] said spiritual matters if you like is
[1:25:18] composed of two parts that intertwine
[1:25:22] but are as opposite as black and white.
[1:25:25] Religion and the spiritual world are
[1:25:27] made of those two trees which had their
[1:25:30] roots in Eden.
[1:25:32] Both the tree of life and the tree of
[1:25:35] knowledge of good and evil stood in the
[1:25:37] midst of the garden and no doubt their
[1:25:40] very branches intertwined with one
[1:25:42] another.
[1:25:51] He said further that Leodysian he said
[1:25:53] the name Leodysia the people's rights or
[1:25:57] justice of the peoples
[1:26:00] was there ever an age like the 20th
[1:26:02] century
[1:26:04] the 20th century church that has seen
[1:26:07] all nations rising up and demanding
[1:26:10] equality social socially and
[1:26:13] financially. This is the age of
[1:26:16] communists where all men are supposed to
[1:26:19] supposedly equal though it is only so in
[1:26:22] theory. The and uh one of the articles I
[1:26:26] read said that this the 20th century was
[1:26:29] the age of exceeding an explosion of
[1:26:33] wealth amongst certain wealthy nations.
[1:26:36] Genesis 4:17 said, "And Cain knew his
[1:26:40] wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch,
[1:26:43] not the Enoch that was translated,
[1:26:45] Enoch, and he builded a city and called
[1:26:49] the name of the city after the name of
[1:26:51] his son Enoch." And that was the
[1:26:54] beginning. And brother Vanna refers to
[1:26:57] the science and the
[1:27:01] uh the the whole musical world. I was
[1:27:06] wanting to find out what I could find
[1:27:10] out about the good life.
[1:27:13] Are you weary?
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Can I carry on?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; And so I thought I would just Google
[1:27:19] Wikipedia is supposed to have
[1:27:20] everything. So you go to Wikipedia. Do
[1:27:22] you know what it starts off with?
[1:27:25] entertainment,
[1:27:28] movies,
[1:27:30] music,
[1:27:31] and I went through a whole big long list
[1:27:33] and came to the end and the whole thing
[1:27:35] was trash from beginning to end.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; The whole thing is lies from beginning
[1:27:40] to end.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; And that's what they started off as the
[1:27:43] good life. If that's a good life, they
[1:27:46] can have it.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; They can fill her belly full of it.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; I want nothing to do with that trash.
[1:27:51] You talk about a snare.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Talk about a snare. Is this true,
[1:27:56] friends?
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And this kind of I'm not I'm I'm not
[1:28:04] even intending on stepping on on any
[1:28:06] toes, but if it does, just don't say
[1:28:08] out. Say, "Amen."
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:18] And the God of this evil age is Satan,
[1:28:21] God of this age, by his knowledge
[1:28:23] getting the people to eat from the from
[1:28:25] his mixed his mixed tree of good and
[1:28:29] evil. His mixed tree
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; of good and evil. Listen friends, this
[1:28:37] enemy is just too subtle,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; too deceiving.
[1:28:43] And if he would deceive the very elect,
[1:28:45] if possible,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Is a very cunning enemy.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Don't ever think through our human
[1:28:54] intellect we can overcome that we need
[1:28:57] the Holy Spirit.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; He says that he is building a greater
[1:29:02] Christian civilization by his knowledge
[1:29:04] of good and evil. a greater Christian
[1:29:07] civilization
[1:29:10] in redemption by now I want to move to
[1:29:12] living the good life and redemption by
[1:29:15] power in prayer brother Brandham says oh
[1:29:18] God this may be the last hour this may
[1:29:22] be the last chance that men will receive
[1:29:26] many no doubt are sitting here men and
[1:29:29] women who desired
[1:29:31] whose life who's lived just a normal
[1:29:34] good life but never have been born again
[1:29:39] doesn't know what it means to be filled
[1:29:41] with the Holy Spirit a complete
[1:29:44] surrendered life with all the shame
[1:29:47] bashfulness taken from them and God's
[1:29:51] spirit baptize them into his mercy isn't
[1:29:54] that wonderful
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; I say oh God that's what anybody would
[1:29:58] desire
[1:30:01] said you you say well I don't drink
[1:30:04] brother Brano I don't smoke. I don't
[1:30:06] gamble. I wouldn't run out on my husband
[1:30:09] or my wife. I live a good life. But the
[1:30:12] devil has perverted that.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; He lets you think to satisfy your guilty
[1:30:21] conscience that you join a church or
[1:30:24] you're all right. That's wrong. That's
[1:30:28] perverting.
[1:30:30] And then Jesus Christ the same
[1:30:32] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:30:34] This was actually in Grand Prairie,
[1:30:36] Alberta, and I happen to be sitting on
[1:30:38] the platform when this message was
[1:30:40] preached. I'm sorry I don't remember
[1:30:43] more of it. I'm actually ashamed I don't
[1:30:45] remember more of it, but I was sitting
[1:30:48] on the platform
[1:30:52] in Grand Prairie, Alberta. He said,
[1:30:54] "Today we go to a service. We act like
[1:30:57] we're going to a funeral service to pay
[1:31:00] honor to the dead instead of worship and
[1:31:03] hail a conqueror.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; You can say amen as I say this.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Christ conquered death.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; He conquered hell.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; He conquered the grave.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; He conquered sin.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; He conquered sickness.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; We are hailing a conqueror.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.
[1:31:27] Not someone died thousands of years ago
[1:31:31] that lived a good life.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Like perhaps Mr. Aristotle did, I don't
[1:31:37] know, or Plato or someone else. And yet
[1:31:39] they will make those things and make
[1:31:41] them almost as idols and idolatry and
[1:31:44] you've got to study this. How come you
[1:31:47] don't have to study the message or study
[1:31:49] some godly godly? How come you don't
[1:31:52] have to study the Bible?
[1:31:56] Why isn't the Bible a key item in the
[1:31:59] UBC or in in in the Western University
[1:32:02] in in Bellingham or Seattle or the
[1:32:06] University of Miami where brother Toby
[1:32:09] came from? Why isn't it a key item?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Some philosopher that died centuries ago
[1:32:17] whose body is nothing but a bunch of
[1:32:20] asses. Jesus never corrupted. His tomb
[1:32:23] is empty. I've been there. It's empty.
[1:32:26] He's a conqueror of death.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Conqueror of hell.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Could come and stand beside a man
[1:32:35] redeemed like you're redeemed like I've
[1:32:38] been redeemed by his grace and mercy and
[1:32:41] stand by him and do the supernatural in
[1:32:44] front of our eyes or in front of our
[1:32:46] ears within our earshot. You can hear
[1:32:48] it.
[1:32:52] You can hear him speak to my family
[1:32:55] friend uh Sister Clint.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; You can hear him say, "You're praying
[1:32:59] for a man. He's not from the city." You
[1:33:02] can hear it.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Perhaps you need to hear it.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Bisc sitting on the platform
[1:33:08] right there while while she's standing
[1:33:11] and he's and the prophet's talking to
[1:33:13] her several feet away from her. And
[1:33:15] you're praying for a man. He's not from
[1:33:17] this city. He's from another another
[1:33:20] place. I believe it's called Fort St.
[1:33:23] John. It was like he was reading it. We
[1:33:25] drove past the man's house.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; The next morning
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; and as we were driving by, he said, "I
[1:33:33] believe there was a woman praying for a
[1:33:35] man dying with cancer here." And I said,
[1:33:39] "Oh," I was all caught up. I said, "Oh,
[1:33:41] Brother Brandham is a a dear friend of
[1:33:43] our family, very well known, our
[1:33:46] family." He never he never smiled. He
[1:33:48] never said anything. We were just
[1:33:50] driving past and as we were driving past
[1:33:53] the place was passing us. He said the
[1:33:55] man's put his hand behind my head. The
[1:33:57] man's in that house.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; You can you can think what what maybe
[1:34:05] passed through my mind. I'm being very
[1:34:06] very honest. I thought, "How do I know
[1:34:08] he's in that house?"
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "Did you think that?" No, the
[1:34:13] devil did.
[1:34:17] and he had access to my mind. So, he
[1:34:19] just let it shot through my mind. Then I
[1:34:22] get about 400 miles up the highway and
[1:34:24] I'm trying to tell brother Southwick all
[1:34:25] about, you know, this kind of ministry
[1:34:27] that this is, he doesn't know Genesis
[1:34:29] from Revelation.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; And I'm trying to tell him about it. I
[1:34:33] said, you know, you know that big old
[1:34:35] white house just before you turn into
[1:34:36] Fort St. John. I said, you know, Brother
[1:34:38] Brandham says, the man's in that house.
[1:34:40] He says, well, I know him. He said, I've
[1:34:42] known him ever since I've been about 8
[1:34:44] years old. He said, "And he is dying
[1:34:46] with cancer."
[1:34:53] Not too terribly long ago, I decided to
[1:34:55] Google his name and he died. This was in
[1:34:59] May. He died in July of that year.
[1:35:02] Brother Bram never said, "Thus said the
[1:35:03] Lord is healed." I was very, very alert,
[1:35:06] but I knew knew her so well. So I wanted
[1:35:09] to know what he did say and he just told
[1:35:12] her to go and
[1:35:15] believe and God bless you
[1:35:18] and the man died. It wasn't it wasn't it
[1:35:21] was it wasn't the case for him but there
[1:35:23] were others.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; There were others. There's a a man
[1:35:28] standing very very dignified Bible
[1:35:31] school teacher standing right beside me
[1:35:36] and uh brother Brandham had a whole row
[1:35:39] of people maybe 40 50 in front of him
[1:35:42] and he's standing there
[1:35:44] and just while he's standing there I'll
[1:35:46] just do what happened. He says the boy
[1:35:49] will be all right.
[1:35:52] while he's standing talking to people
[1:35:56] just cries out the boy will be all right
[1:35:59] over his shoulder like that and this man
[1:36:02] tall dignified Paul Cornish was his name
[1:36:07] he was a very very dignified man he was
[1:36:09] a pastor of the church right there and
[1:36:13] he just went like this like that and he
[1:36:17] was shaking and convulsing with tears
[1:36:20] instantly like he'd been hit with a
[1:36:21] hammer
[1:36:23] And I I I didn't know what was
[1:36:25] happening. All I hear is this voice and
[1:36:27] something
[1:36:29] power some force. I I I'm I'm in an
[1:36:32] absolute dilemma. I don't I don't
[1:36:35] understand what's happening. And here's
[1:36:37] this man who's a very dignified man
[1:36:40] folded right over and convulsing in
[1:36:44] tears. And when he straightens up, he
[1:36:46] stands beside me. He's a little taller
[1:36:48] than myself
[1:36:50] and a little older.
[1:36:53] And he touches me and he says, "Brother
[1:36:54] Eddie," he said, "You see down the
[1:36:57] prayer line way down towards the back?"
[1:37:01] Didn't look like they'd ever get there
[1:37:02] to him. He said, "See that young man
[1:37:05] there?" He said, "That's my son, and
[1:37:07] he's up for a serious operation this
[1:37:11] next week."
[1:37:13] And here, just caught like that, the boy
[1:37:16] will be all right.
[1:37:19] What am I supposed What am I supposed to
[1:37:21] do with those things?
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; You tell me. What am I supposed to do?
[1:37:24] Am I supposed to declare them? Should I
[1:37:26] declare them?
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to declare them.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Are you happy to hear it?
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; These things are true.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; How does a man from Jeffersonville know
[1:37:40] the boy's going to be all right? Right.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; How does he know the woman's praying for
[1:37:45] a man 40 40 50 miles up the road dying
[1:37:48] with cancer and he lives in that white
[1:37:50] house and brother Bud Southweight knows
[1:37:52] him and has known him since he was a
[1:37:54] child. Who knows that?
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; I would say it would be good for us to
[1:37:59] be in tune with that kind of wisdom.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; It would be good for us to be in tune
[1:38:05] with that kind of thought. And that
[1:38:07] thought never came from the tree of
[1:38:09] knowledge.
[1:38:11] That thought never came out of a
[1:38:13] scholarship out of a university and
[1:38:16] never came out of a a seminary,
[1:38:19] never came out of a denomination.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; I would sooner have that man say a
[1:38:24] prophet never came out of a denomination
[1:38:27] ever came.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "And when they denominated,
[1:38:30] they died." And I would just say,
[1:38:32] "Amen."
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; I want to be tapped into life. And not
[1:38:38] only life, life is good. I'm alive now,
[1:38:42] but this body is dying.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to have eternal life
[1:38:47] through the knowledge,
[1:38:49] the tree of knowledge,
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; even though it's good.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; And there's all kinds of And the good
[1:38:54] part of it simply relates to this life.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; That's all. It just relates to this
[1:39:00] life.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm not only interested in this
[1:39:03] life, friends.
[1:39:08] It passes too quickly.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; There's too much suffering. There's too
[1:39:13] much pain. There's
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; too much trouble.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Who wants this life?
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Is that not so?
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, well, let's it's it's good."
[1:39:26] Don't forget what's good came from the
[1:39:28] tree of knowledge of good and evil. And
[1:39:31] anything that came from it and
[1:39:33] everything that came from it is
[1:39:35] perishing
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; and will die. And will die. I'll say it
[1:39:40] one more time. And will die.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; So glad and so thankful we can be tied
[1:39:50] into.
[1:39:54] And behold, one came and said to Jesus,
[1:40:00] said unto him, Good Master, good master,
[1:40:06] what good thing shall I do that I may
[1:40:08] have eternal life? And he said unto him,
[1:40:10] why callst thou me good?
[1:40:14] It's a question. Why callst thou me
[1:40:16] good? There is none good, but one, that
[1:40:20] is God.
[1:40:22] What is he saying?
[1:40:24] There's none good but God.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; And he's the source of eternal life.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; God that fills all time and space. I
[1:40:35] want that kind of God that's the
[1:40:37] fountain of all wisdom, divine wisdom. I
[1:40:41] want a God that's a fountain of all
[1:40:43] holiness. There's nothing much holy
[1:40:46] here, is there?
[1:40:53] And he said unto him, "Why callst thou
[1:40:55] me good? There is none good but one that
[1:40:57] is God. And if thou will enter into
[1:40:59] life, keep the commandments." And he
[1:41:02] said, "All of these I I've kept."
[1:41:06] Good in the Greek thought is that which
[1:41:09] is good, excellent, distinguished,
[1:41:11] upright, and honorable. And that is all
[1:41:13] fine. Those are all words which would
[1:41:15] describe this life. But I would say good
[1:41:19] needs to be eternal life. Oh, God is
[1:41:23] good.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; But we don't think of him in
[1:41:27] relationship to, you know, jobs and my
[1:41:30] bills are paid. And that's not the good
[1:41:32] we're talking about. We're talking about
[1:41:33] the good
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; that when no one left on this earth can
[1:41:39] hold your hand
[1:41:41] or forgive your sins, you have met one.
[1:41:46] And the guilt is gone.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Friends, that's what has to happen.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Born again.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Can I take a few more minutes?
[1:42:05] If it is not understood,
[1:42:08] if this is not understood,
[1:42:11] believers
[1:42:12] can find themselves
[1:42:15] unnecessarily
[1:42:17] entangled
[1:42:19] or ens snared in many difficulties. And
[1:42:24] the reason why I said I was going to
[1:42:25] provide material because you can't
[1:42:27] define
[1:42:29] you know everybody's situation is
[1:42:30] entirely different and God will lead a
[1:42:34] person differently and you need the Holy
[1:42:36] Spirit to lead you in this life
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; whether it be in job whether it be in
[1:42:41] education whether it be in
[1:42:44] uh success
[1:42:47] or whether it be in what the world may
[1:42:49] consider failure.
[1:42:51] Uh, you may be unemployed right now.
[1:42:54] That's fine. You can have I I think
[1:42:56] maybe the woman was unemployed. I don't
[1:42:58] know.
[1:43:02] She found a place
[1:43:05] with Jesus Christ.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; She had a conversation with Jesus
[1:43:10] Christ.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ stopped for her.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Sat on the well for her.
[1:43:21] You don't ever find that happening with
[1:43:23] a queen
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; or with royalty
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; or celebrities
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; or all these women that are made
[1:43:32] goddesses of Hollywood and are facing on
[1:43:36] all of the magazines when you come to
[1:43:38] pay at the cash register for your food.
[1:43:41] Listen friends, is this is this true or
[1:43:44] not true?
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to know. Jesus, did
[1:43:48] Jesus have time? If if they would
[1:43:52] repent, he'll have time for them.
[1:43:55] But I don't I don't want to get into
[1:43:57] predestination.
[1:44:00] It is under if it is understood, this
[1:44:04] subject needs to be understood by
[1:44:05] believers otherwise they can find
[1:44:08] themselves unnecessarily
[1:44:11] entangled or ins snared in many
[1:44:13] difficulties. The good from this tree
[1:44:16] did not originate from the tree of life.
[1:44:22] And here's the quote. In this world
[1:44:25] that we live in, this education,
[1:44:29] science, civilization, when I say
[1:44:33] education, I am not anti-education.
[1:44:37] I believe in education,
[1:44:39] but I believe that a person needs the
[1:44:41] Holy Spirit to guide them.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Some of you are in business. You need
[1:44:47] the Holy Ghost to guide you in business,
[1:44:50] to guide you in a job, to guide you in a
[1:44:54] marriage.
[1:44:57] cannot ever be a trap or a snare
[1:45:01] to guide you in your peers with your
[1:45:04] relationships and who you are with and
[1:45:08] who you are close to in this world we
[1:45:11] live in this education, science,
[1:45:13] civilization and all these things that
[1:45:16] we seemingly so enjoy today is of Satan.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; And will perish.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:45:28] We need and we must have the leadership
[1:45:31] and discernment of the Holy Ghost to to
[1:45:35] discern between that which is good
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; and that which is evil.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:45] You say, and now I'm continuing on with
[1:45:47] the quote. You say, brother Brandham,
[1:45:49] civilization. Yes, sir. This
[1:45:51] civilization came by Satan. And that's
[1:45:53] why I said what I have said up to this
[1:45:55] time about civilization and all the
[1:45:58] things that we have and all the
[1:45:59] trappings that we have. Number one, I I
[1:46:03] hope you forgive me on one hand, but we
[1:46:08] have to have it. We have to have certain
[1:46:11] things. I've got to get out and I got to
[1:46:14] drive in my old car. You say, "Old car?"
[1:46:17] Yeah, it's an old car. I I need to drive
[1:46:20] home. I need to have a bite to eat and
[1:46:22] we'll need it to drive back to the
[1:46:24] service. And don't you?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; But is it is there anything eternal or
[1:46:32] anything that's going to gain you?
[1:46:39] No, I won't say it.
[1:46:45] I have asked
[1:46:47] I have asked people
[1:46:50] who had all kinds of degrees and we have
[1:46:54] people here that have all kinds of
[1:46:55] degrees and I honor them and I respect
[1:46:58] that. Don't ever think that I don't. I
[1:47:01] do.
[1:47:03] But I said to one person who actually
[1:47:06] was giving up the message
[1:47:08] to get all of this and I said once you
[1:47:12] achieve it
[1:47:14] I said are you going to paper your walls
[1:47:17] with the degrees
[1:47:19] and then I said the time will come
[1:47:24] now I'm across the desk from you. The
[1:47:26] time will come
[1:47:29] when trouble will come and you'll need
[1:47:32] to call upon God.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; I said, are you going to fall down
[1:47:38] before those degrees
[1:47:40] and those certificates and say, "Oh my
[1:47:42] gods.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; I need you now."
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Is that going to happen?
[1:47:51] That same person
[1:47:53] called me on the phone later
[1:47:58] and said,
[1:47:59] "I have a lump in my breast
[1:48:02] and I have cancer."
[1:48:05] I didn't want to be facitious and say,
[1:48:08] "Why don't you call to your
[1:48:09] certificates?"
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; What's that going to do?
[1:48:16] And another time was even worse.
[1:48:20] You know, I'm I'm being honest and I'm
[1:48:22] being very very forthright.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what we achieve in this
[1:48:27] life.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; I know what I know what the world the
[1:48:33] world will throw promotions and throw
[1:48:37] degrees and throw things. That's fine.
[1:48:40] Get get them all. Get all that you can,
[1:48:43] but hold it under the leadership of the
[1:48:45] Holy Spirit. He's the only one that
[1:48:47] knows what to do with it.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; I'll just take a few more minutes and
[1:48:53] then I'm going to close.
[1:49:00] He says, "The kingdom of God
[1:49:03] will not have automobiles." Thank God.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:49:09] Not have airplanes.
[1:49:11] Thank God.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; I'm sure there's a lot of people in
[1:49:14] Russia right now who would like to say,
[1:49:15] "Thank God."
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Won't have airplanes.
[1:49:19] There are they're in grief. They're in
[1:49:22] agony over the many over the hundreds,
[1:49:26] 224 that were killed
[1:49:30] on the Sinai Desert on a Russian
[1:49:33] airplane that went down yesterday.
[1:49:39] won't have airplanes
[1:49:41] or any scientific achievements.
[1:49:44] No, it won't have any education
[1:49:47] at all. It'll be an education so supreme
[1:49:51] to this
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; that this won't even be thought of
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; education, civilization, and all of this
[1:49:57] comes from Satan. And having said all of
[1:50:00] that, we not we are not opposed to the
[1:50:04] good and all that the good can be that
[1:50:07] good can be that you can attain to in
[1:50:11] this life. That's fine. Let God must be
[1:50:15] the head and the director and in control
[1:50:18] of all of it.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; You believe me?
[1:50:35] power of transformation. So God in this
[1:50:38] his great kingdom that is to come we
[1:50:41] will have we will have a civilization
[1:50:46] but it'll not be anything like this. It
[1:50:49] won't be by science. It'll be by faith.
[1:50:53] Civilization by the word. This
[1:50:57] scientific civilization we have is
[1:50:59] exactly Satan's trap.
[1:51:02] this church and all who hear my voice on
[1:51:05] the internet or ever will hear my voice
[1:51:08] needs to say amen in full agreement to
[1:51:12] that statement that uh uh it's exactly
[1:51:16] Satan's trap.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; And that's what he has that's what he
[1:51:22] has killed the people with. That's what
[1:51:25] he is killing us every day with. That's
[1:51:28] how as we eat uh each day instead of
[1:51:32] living we die. Is that true?
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; At some point in time you know you're
[1:51:40] getting stronger and your youth and all
[1:51:42] all all those things.
[1:51:46] It doesn't need to be but it can be a
[1:51:48] trap.
[1:51:51] Young ladies born with beauty.
[1:51:55] Brother Brandham actually felt sorry for
[1:51:58] some said because there the beauty was
[1:52:02] given to you by God.
[1:52:04] Youth young men was given to you by God
[1:52:07] but it's fading away and over a period
[1:52:10] of time it'll vanish
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; and you'll be like me
[1:52:17] or someone like that
[1:52:20] you know it'll change.
[1:52:25] Oh, thank God for eternal life.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Thank God for eternal life.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, "They have so perverted
[1:52:35] everything to even take just so much of
[1:52:38] this and mix it with this and hybrid
[1:52:40] this and that till it's dying. It's a
[1:52:44] dying race."
[1:52:49] Now, the good from the tree. Are you
[1:52:51] still with me a few minutes?
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Paul said, Apostle Paul said,
[1:52:58] "For we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:53:01] part or we preach in part. But when that
[1:53:04] which is perfect is come, then that
[1:53:07] which is in part shall be done away."
[1:53:10] When I was a child, when I was a child,
[1:53:15] I understood as a child that wasn't
[1:53:18] evil.
[1:53:20] When I was a when I was a child,
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; I understood as a child. Maybe it was
[1:53:24] foolish. You didn't. Maybe. Hey, you're
[1:53:28] not even on the right planet, boy.
[1:53:31] Was it evil? No. No. He understood as a
[1:53:34] child. When I was a child, I understood
[1:53:36] as a child. And I spake as a child. I
[1:53:39] understood as a child. I thought as a
[1:53:42] child. And when I became a man, I put
[1:53:44] away childish things.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; The child part wasn't evil part. Wasn't
[1:53:49] evil. It was good. It was wonderful. We
[1:53:52] all had our youth and our childhood.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:58] I'm glad I was a kid.
[1:54:06] You get a big joke out of these things.
[1:54:09] You know, I I I was I was a boy when the
[1:54:12] war was on, and I thought, boy, you
[1:54:16] know, all I could think about was men in
[1:54:19] uniform and soldiers and guns and
[1:54:23] artillery and so on. They came into our
[1:54:26] town. I was just going down the down the
[1:54:28] alley and they came into our town,
[1:54:29] Brother John, uh with the big trucks
[1:54:32] pulling artillery weapons behind them
[1:54:35] and I thought the war had reached here.
[1:54:37] I went screaming home that they're here,
[1:54:40] the soldiers are here, and guns are here
[1:54:42] and everything. And so I was so obsessed
[1:54:45] with this. My dad had a pile of
[1:54:48] kindling. I've never told this, and I
[1:54:50] don't want you to ever repeat it.
[1:54:55] My dad had a pile of kindling. So I got
[1:54:58] out by the wood wood in the kindling and
[1:55:00] I started I took a axe or the hammer the
[1:55:03] head of the axe I can't remember which
[1:55:05] and I started pinging pounding one stick
[1:55:08] of kindling. Oh that looks so strong and
[1:55:12] I pile I drove down another one another
[1:55:14] one. I made it like a rug like a carpet
[1:55:17] out from the single just solid. It was
[1:55:21] so strong. I thought boy if the enemy
[1:55:24] ever drops a bomb here will it ever
[1:55:26] surprise them? It won't do a thing.
[1:55:30] When I was a child,
[1:55:33] I thought as a child,
[1:55:35] but when I put up I I'm glad I got to be
[1:55:37] a man could put away those things.
[1:55:40] I don't think that a few sticks of
[1:55:42] kindling are ever going to stop a bomb.
[1:55:45] But but I I I just I I felt so good that
[1:55:48] I had made this so protected. Wow. If
[1:55:51] the enemy ever comes here, won't they
[1:55:54] ever be surprised that drop a bomb here
[1:55:56] won't do a thing?
[1:55:58] Well, I finally have I finally have
[1:56:02] something with some authority behind it.
[1:56:04] Says they could drop an a bomb
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; and won't do a thing before that first
[1:56:10] bomb drops. Bride's gone.
[1:56:13] [Applause]
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; I sooner believe that. That's right.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said this, "Send your
[1:56:25] children to school and get education and
[1:56:28] so forth." But I'll tell you right now,
[1:56:31] it won't do them any good in the world
[1:56:33] that's to come.
[1:56:36] Well, I got a degree here. What have I
[1:56:38] got over here? Uh, how much faith do you
[1:56:41] have?
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; How much faith did you exercise?
[1:56:46] He says it won't do them any good in the
[1:56:48] world that's to come because there'll be
[1:56:50] another civilization so far above this.
[1:56:54] He said education is all right very fine
[1:56:57] thing and we need it. God knows that.
[1:57:00] But we need salvation worse than we need
[1:57:03] education.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; You all agree with that.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Get all that you can. But we need
[1:57:12] salvation worse.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be sitting here
[1:57:16] today and you're concerned about, you
[1:57:18] know, your studies or where you're going
[1:57:21] to get. Just be concerned about your
[1:57:23] soul
[1:57:25] and
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; where you are.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; You know what I get troubled about is
[1:57:30] when I ask God for things and it doesn't
[1:57:34] seem to happen.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about.
[1:57:40] and pray over things that seem
[1:57:43] desperately
[1:57:44] desperately needful.
[1:57:48] I didn't know that it was going to be
[1:57:50] this way,
[1:57:53] Brother David Law. I didn't know that
[1:57:55] you'd be sitting in this service,
[1:58:00] but the kind of intelligence
[1:58:05] and I'm going to say this publicly,
[1:58:08] our brother David Laws
[1:58:11] was dying and he was actually in the
[1:58:14] grip which wasn't known at the moment
[1:58:17] with flesheating disease.
[1:58:20] Is this all right, brother David? Have
[1:58:22] your permission.
[1:58:27] and his mother and dad came
[1:58:30] and were sitting in the waiting room
[1:58:33] because the hospital and medical people
[1:58:35] didn't expect him to live.
[1:58:38] Sister Violet, his
[1:58:41] wife who's sitting there now looking at
[1:58:43] me,
[1:58:45] she all remained such a stalart woman of
[1:58:48] faith.
[1:58:50] just continued on. And I went in and
[1:58:55] David's mother and dad were sitting
[1:58:57] there.
[1:58:59] He's in ICU.
[1:59:01] He's been unconscious and has not come
[1:59:04] to.
[1:59:08] And the Holy Spirit spoke to me and
[1:59:10] said,
[1:59:13] "Go and tell David that he shall rise
[1:59:19] and stand in the company of the saints
[1:59:22] and give glory to God."
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you this publicly because
[1:59:29] David is here to
[1:59:32] to confirm. Sister Violet is here to
[1:59:34] confirm. I couldn't go in till Violet
[1:59:37] came out.
[1:59:40] And she came out come into the little
[1:59:43] waiting room just a little we waiting
[1:59:46] room with just a few chairs and I see
[1:59:48] you and Langley
[1:59:51] and I walked in. I walked in beside
[1:59:54] David's bed and he has no remembrance or
[1:59:57] recollection of this that I he has told
[2:00:00] me.
[2:00:02] and I put my hand upon the stainless
[2:00:05] steel railing on the bed and he was
[2:00:08] laying there had never been awake. He
[2:00:11] opened his eyes,
[2:00:13] smiled,
[2:00:16] said, "Hi, brother Ed."
[2:00:18] I said, "How are you, Brother David?" We
[2:00:22] said, "I've been I was kind of wanting
[2:00:25] to see you." And I said, "Brother David,
[2:00:30] just a moment." I said, "I met you in
[2:00:33] the foyer of the church and I knew that
[2:00:36] your heart was heavy. I knew you wanted
[2:00:39] to talk to me, but I have a message for
[2:00:41] you."
[2:00:44] I said, "God has told me, you shall rise
[2:00:49] and stand in the company of the saints
[2:00:52] and give glory to God."
[2:00:54] That man rose. They sent him from that
[2:00:57] hospital downtown to one of the major
[2:01:00] hospitals because they couldn't do
[2:01:02] anything more for him. And that hospital
[2:01:04] said he just kept living and they might
[2:01:07] as well just send him back. They sent
[2:01:09] him back and four months later he stood
[2:01:12] behind this pulpit that you're looking
[2:01:14] at and gave glory to God.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of education.
[2:01:22] That's the kind of I don't know how, but
[2:01:25] that's the kind of God
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; I want to serve.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God that deserves our
[2:01:32] all young men.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget it. That's the kind of
[2:01:38] God. Why does he do that? I don't know.
[2:01:41] But he does it for his glory. Brother
[2:01:43] David, Sister Violet, we're here to give
[2:01:46] him glory. Even if it is this last time,
[2:01:48] I want to give him glory. These things
[2:01:51] are from him.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; We've prayed for other things and and uh
[2:01:55] perhaps God doesn't do it and he can be
[2:01:58] silent and the prophet says even silence
[2:02:01] is an answer.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; God has a right to be silent.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; So he may not say anything but when he
[2:02:09] does things it's for his glory.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; It's not for the glory of any man or any
[2:02:14] preacher or anything else or not any
[2:02:16] church or any building or any other
[2:02:18] name. It's for his glory. Amen.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Does this congregation say amen for
[2:02:22] that?
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of that's the kind of
[2:02:29] things that come from the tree of life,
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Not the tree of knowledge.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; And with that, I'm going to close.
[2:02:50] Oh God.
[2:02:53] Oh God.
[2:02:57] We want more of it. Lord,
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; we need more of it.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; We want to see your hand move. Oh God.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; We want to see. How many hunger for
[2:03:10] that?
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; You hunger for that.
[2:03:15] eternal thing.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, there's friends,
[2:03:20] there is a supernatural aspect.
[2:03:24] I don't want it to miss us. I don't want
[2:03:26] to miss it.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; I want to say the supernatural
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; in this congregation,
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; the supernatural in your homes.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, come on the scene.
[2:03:39] We want to see the supernatural in our
[2:03:41] lives. We have needs, oh God. We have
[2:03:45] needs, Father. We have needs for the
[2:03:47] supernatural. And we pray, oh God,
[2:03:50] you'll find it. you'll find us uh uh
[2:03:54] willing and surrendered and prepared to
[2:03:57] receive from you, Father, as I've taken
[2:04:01] and spoken of you and spoken of what
[2:04:03] your messenger has said and spoken, oh
[2:04:07] God, out of the scriptures and have
[2:04:09] talked to the people today from my
[2:04:12] heart. And now we have here, Father, and
[2:04:15] I did not expect it to be this way, but
[2:04:19] we have here our brother David Law. Oh
[2:04:21] God, I want to forever give you glory
[2:04:25] over what you have done. You had a
[2:04:28] purpose in doing it. And perhaps this
[2:04:30] was part of the purpose. I do not know.
[2:04:32] But let it anchor in the people's
[2:04:34] hearts. I pray for our young men and our
[2:04:37] young women, oh God, that you'll guide
[2:04:40] them by the Holy Spirit. And there'll be
[2:04:42] such a baptism of the Holy Ghost in in
[2:04:45] the individual lives. Father, let them
[2:04:48] hunger and thirst after you until,
[2:04:51] Father, they have the confidence, "My
[2:04:54] God shall lead me, and they might say
[2:04:57] with the with the King David, that he
[2:05:01] who he he shall deliver me from the from
[2:05:03] the snare of the fowler, the hunter
[2:05:07] might be in the in every area of life.
[2:05:11] the hunter and the fowlers in every area
[2:05:14] of life. But we defy that enemy. We defy
[2:05:19] his deceit. We defy of false and
[2:05:23] unbelief. We defy the doubt in the name
[2:05:26] of Jesus Christ. Grant faith, oh God.
[2:05:30] Make this people a people of faith. May
[2:05:33] they be stalwart. Father in uh in the
[2:05:37] supernatural things we ask for the
[2:05:39] perfect faith of Jesus Christ. Oh God.
[2:05:43] Oh God. I pray father that we might have
[2:05:47] the we might express oh God the
[2:05:50] simplicity and the faith of Jesus
[2:05:53] Christ. Come amongst them. Oh God. We
[2:05:56] can never be satisfied to drink to
[2:05:59] stagnation waters of stagnation. We will
[2:06:02] not live in the past. We will not live
[2:06:04] in history. We will not live in the
[2:06:07] ancients. Oh God, but we need a God
[2:06:09] that's a God of the current moment. A
[2:06:12] God that's a God with the children, with
[2:06:15] the teachers, Father, in this school of
[2:06:18] BCA, oh God, in the other colleges of
[2:06:22] higher learning where they may go, may
[2:06:24] they never have, oh Father, their faith
[2:06:28] diluted. I pray in the name of Jesus,
[2:06:30] you'll rise us up above being a church.
[2:06:33] May we be a Holy Ghost people, Father,
[2:06:36] in the blessed name of Jesus Christ. And
[2:06:39] to glorify that name is my prayer.
[2:06:43] Hallelujah.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
