[5:18] When I need healing,
[5:22] I [music and singing]
[5:27] do not know. I [music and singing] do
[5:31] not know
[5:34] how others [singing]
[5:36] make it [music] through.
[5:41] You never

[6:32] [singing] me.
[6:34] [music]
[6:36] for all my sins, [music]
[6:40] my sickness, [singing]
[6:42] and my pain.
[6:46] When [music and singing] I need healing,
[6:51] I claim those precious [singing]
[6:54] blood stains.
[6:58] It's [singing] already done.
[7:01] [music]
[7:04] Oh,

[8:49] The [singing] battle is over.
[8:53] The victory [music and singing]

[8:59] As we stand as a declaration [singing]
[9:02] this morning, lift it up to [music] him
[9:04] now. It's already done.
[9:09] It's already [music and singing] done.
[9:12] is already

[9:24] the victory [music and singing]

[9:33] [music]
[9:33] [singing]
[9:35] hallelujah.
[9:38] Hallelujah.
[9:40] Glory to your name, Lord.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We fight, [music] but he's
[9:47] defeated.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; He's an enemy, but he's already lost.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; We serve a risen savior. [music]
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Living in you, living in me. Amen.
[10:00] Brother John, would you mind opening
[10:01] [music] the service this morning in a
[10:03] word of prayer? I believe there's
[10:05] victory in the camp.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's things we struggle
[10:08] with and there's things that [music] we
[10:09] fight with, but that's just because we
[10:11] have an adversary. Amen. But we believe
[10:14] the word of God is true. [music] We have
[10:16] overcome by the blood of the lamb, the
[10:19] word of our testimony. I bless you each
[10:21] one that's gathered [music] in this
[10:22] morning. We do want to remember a
[10:24] request for from sister Sonia in Croatia
[10:28] to pray for [music] a family in Hungary.
[10:31] This family is broken. Drug addicted
[10:34] children. Father and mother are
[10:36] believing. Amen. We'll believe with them
[10:39] this morning. The family is sealed.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; God is our healer of every [music]
[10:45] situation. Sister Tracy Rivas has
[10:47] written in a request to pray for Sister
[10:50] Kim Kak from Brother David Mciri's
[10:53] church in Texas. [music] She has very
[10:55] serious health needs and is currently in
[10:58] uh Washington DC seeking treatment.
[11:01] needs a move of God in a very
[11:03] supernatural way for healing while she
[11:06] is there. Amen. We w want to just pray
[11:09] that God will heal her and [music] open
[11:11] the doors that need opening at this time
[11:13] for her. We'll believe with you, Sister
[11:14] Tracy, [music] on her behalf this
[11:16] morning. If you have a need upon your
[11:18] heart, just desire that the mighty God
[11:20] will move [music] on your behalf this
[11:22] morning. We do want to remember brother
[11:23] Hugh message this morning. God will
[11:26] [music] lift him up.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother John, God bless you. Our
[11:34] dear heavenly father, we want to lift up
[11:36] our hands and lift up our hearts.
[11:40] We approach you in quietness, Lord,
[11:42] realizing how great and awesome is your
[11:44] [music] presence.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; We want to thank you for the blood of
[11:48] Jesus Christ that covers each one of us.
[11:52] Your prophet has already spoken to us
[11:54] and said, "You hear our voices coming up
[11:58] through the blood." I pray that you
[12:00] would see your life today, the precious
[12:03] blood of Jesus that has invited us into
[12:06] your presence.
[12:09] How many prayer lines did your prophet
[12:11] have? And he said, "If there's sin in
[12:14] your life,
[12:17] step out of line and repent of that and
[12:21] step back in line to receive the
[12:24] healing, to receive the answer. Our dear
[12:28] heavenly father in communion service we
[12:32] are commanded to wait on one another
[12:37] we realize men and women today stand in
[12:40] your presence all of us
[12:44] claiming that streaming blood that cord
[12:48] for the token over our lives because
[12:51] without that and without this message
[12:55] there is no life.
[12:58] But because you've come to us in this
[13:00] generation, [music]
[13:01] we can throw open our arms, throw open
[13:04] our hearts and cry, "Aba, Father," and
[13:07] know that everything that we have need
[13:09] of, every need, every desire, every
[13:13] request is met within you.
[13:17] So Lord, you have placed gifts in the
[13:20] church.
[13:22] And Lord, we welcome you. the greatest
[13:25] gift ever, the Holy Ghost, to come and
[13:28] feel welcome today at Cloverdale Bible
[13:31] Way. This little address here on the
[13:34] hill, but more than that, souls and
[13:37] spirits and bodies of men and women cry
[13:40] out to you.
[13:42] We already sense your presence and the
[13:44] angels have taken their place. But
[13:47] there's something about redeemed men and
[13:50] women that can only sing about grace and
[13:53] mercy comes up to another level when men
[13:57] and women reach beyond the veil. Touch
[13:59] the hymn of almighty God.
[14:03] Lord Jesus, we love you today God and we
[14:06] want to welcome you first place. We want
[14:09] to crown you Lord of all and surrender
[14:12] everything and ask for forgiveness of
[14:15] every sin, every unbelief.
[14:18] As we approach you solemnly, we want to
[14:21] put everything under the blood of Jesus
[14:24] Christ. It's not our merits. It's not
[14:27] one another, it's you, Lord. And we
[14:29] claim that today and pray that you would
[14:32] cover this assembly, cover the
[14:34] sanctuary, this address, and out upon
[14:37] the internet. We pray that the Holy
[14:39] Ghost would anoint every individual,
[14:42] every predestinated seed to receive
[14:45] exactly what they have need of. Hands
[14:48] are lifted up.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; You're touched with the feeling of our
[14:52] infirmities.
[14:54] The high priest is here. The Holy Ghost
[14:57] is here. the one that seeks out every uh
[15:01] sheep like a great shepherd that knows
[15:03] all the details, all the fine print of
[15:06] every situation. We lay that out on the
[15:09] altar right now and ask you to consume
[15:12] it with your holy fire. Lord, take the
[15:16] service today and may Satan be defeated.
[15:19] May every unbelieving spirit and demon
[15:22] from hell be held captive at the name of
[15:25] Jesus. May the gift of the Holy Ghost
[15:28] work openly today amongst the
[15:32] congregation as we wait upon you and
[15:35] everything that's said and done today
[15:37] would be for the glory of God. Lord, we
[15:40] remember these couple requests, Lord,
[15:42] and hungry. We believe that you're more
[15:44] than able to deliver any spirit that
[15:47] would come in any family to divide a
[15:49] husband or a wife or children. Anything
[15:52] that comes in the household to break up
[15:55] oneness is not of God. So we claim the
[15:58] oneness of Jesus Christ. For every
[16:01] individual in this family in Hungary, we
[16:04] claim their loved ones under the token
[16:07] and we bind our hearts together across
[16:09] the oceans. not just for their family
[16:12] but for every family that the
[16:14] desperation cries would re unleash that
[16:18] power to bring souls to repentance.
[16:22] Even our dear sister from Dallas that's
[16:24] in Washington. Lord, you know the
[16:26] secrets of her heart and her needs and
[16:28] her personal life. Doctors and nurses
[16:31] and [music] they can all have their
[16:33] part. But the great healer, the great
[16:35] physician is you, Lord Jesus. And we
[16:38] release your power Lord God upon every
[16:41] need and every life. Nothing is hidden
[16:44] from your presence God. And we are here
[16:47] to adore you and worship you. And Lord
[16:50] Jesus give you first place. Take every
[16:54] song today, every prayer. May you
[16:57] sanction your will in every life. And
[16:59] may you just Lord be pleased with today.
[17:02] We give you this whole day and this
[17:04] service, this offering. May you multiply
[17:07] it to your service and for the glory of
[17:10] God. We give you ourselves, Lord, in
[17:13] worship. Take each life and fill us with
[17:16] your presence. And our brother Ron
[17:18] Spencer, may the Holy Ghost take the
[17:21] vessel, take the gift of God in his
[17:24] life, strengthen him, and may you give
[17:26] him eagle vision to say those things
[17:30] only that is thus sayeth the Lord. And
[17:33] may the Lord Jesus get behind the veil
[17:36] and say the things that we individually
[17:39] have need of for you to say. And we
[17:42] reverence you in Jesus Christ's name.
[17:45] [music] Amen.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:48] God bless you. As you have your seats
[17:50] [music] this morning, the deacons
[17:52] receive the offering. Certainly want to
[17:56] thank them for [music] that. Amen. God
[17:58] bless you, Brother Sam.
[18:03] Let's sing together. 11:03 I just want
[18:05] to thank you Lord for letting me hear
[18:06] your word. Key of G as well.
[18:10] There's a uh white Jetta.
[18:13] License [music] plate DN7. I don't even
[18:17] know my license plate. If you have a
[18:18] white Jetta and it's out [music] in the
[18:20] parking lot and you drove it here today,
[18:22] go turn your lights off. Your battery
[18:24] will work and then you can go get some
[18:26] lunch.
[18:28] Amen. We're happy to be in the house of
[18:30] the Lord.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's nice to have each and every
[18:32] one of you here. Those that have
[18:34] connected with us on the internet say
[18:36] God bless you to you as well. Amen.
[18:38] Folks [music] stream from all over as
[18:40] you've heard on watch night. There were
[18:42] messages that came in that said they
[18:43] wanted to greet you and thank you for
[18:45] being at your post of duty so
[18:47] faithfully. [music]
[18:48] Amen. We would certainly appreciate the
[18:50] ministry. Let's sing this together.
[18:52] We'll turn the service to brother Ed
[18:54] here in just a moment. Invite him to
[18:56] come. [music]
[18:57] You didn't have to open [singing]
[19:00] my eyes.
[19:02] You could have easily passed [music]
[19:05] me by. [singing]
[19:07] Oh, the age I was living [music]
[19:09] in was fur.
[19:12] [singing]
[19:16] Then I heard recognizing [music]
[19:18] your name
[19:20] serge [singing]
[19:23] [music]
[19:25] [singing]
[19:26] and the mercy of grace. Lord, I thank
[19:31] you. Thank you [music] this morning.
[19:33] [singing]
[19:33] I just want to thank you Lord [music]
[19:38] for letting me hear [singing] your word.
[19:42] What have [music] I done to deserve such
[19:46] glory [singing] revealed in me? [music]
[19:56] [music and singing]
[20:05] &gt;&gt; [singing and music]
[20:05] &gt;&gt; I thank you. I just want to thank you,
[20:09] Lord. I just want to [singing] thank
[20:12] you, Lord,
[20:14] for [music]
[20:15] you.
[20:19] I [singing]
[20:21] deserve such glory [music]
[20:28] for [music]
[20:31] when I saw your glorious [music]
[20:41] I.
[20:43] [music]
[20:45] Amen. God bless you each one.
[20:48] I am just going to take a few moments
[20:51] out of the service
[20:53] uh because
[20:56] we don't want to
[20:59] uh cramp or feel that the ministry is
[21:02] cramped
[21:04] &gt;&gt; for a time and uh I want to take a few
[21:07] moments and read a few scriptures.
[21:10] [clears throat] We're going to have an
[21:12] ordination
[21:14] service.
[21:15] But I wanted to say and I have been
[21:19] pondering this for several weeks,
[21:22] probably three, four weeks.
[21:25] [clears throat] To ordain
[21:29] is misunderstood, very much
[21:32] [clears throat] misunderstood.
[21:36] to appoint a person to preaching or
[21:40] other religious duties. However,
[21:44] there must be an author.
[21:48] If you look up the word in your
[21:50] dictionary or on your internet, you'll
[21:53] find it's someone that's being placed
[21:56] into an office, etc. But I was very much
[22:01] very much forced to go back and I had my
[22:05] wife reading all of these things and I
[22:09] said no no no no it's not it's way back
[22:12] of that and the scripture says quite a
[22:15] bit about it. So I was uh reading some
[22:18] scripture and I'm going to give you some
[22:20] of those scriptures just now.
[22:24] There must be an author
[22:28] and an author or a foundation
[22:32] to this sacred act
[22:36] &gt;&gt; because
[22:37] I read in the scripture where the Jews
[22:40] ordained it wasn't right.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Uh and another one of the Old Testament
[22:47] saints ordained and people they were
[22:52] swept away with it. But he had a golden
[22:55] calf in Jerusalem and a golden calf in
[22:59] the far north so that the people for
[23:03] convenience sake. So everything that is
[23:06] just for convenience isn't necessarily
[23:09] of God. But when God does the ordaining
[23:15] and uh I'm going to read some scriptures
[23:17] for the gifts and calling
[23:21] and callings of God are without
[23:24] repentance. That scripture is used by
[23:28] the prophet of God very often.
[23:32] For the gifts and calling of God are
[23:35] without repentance. It's something that
[23:38] a person is born with and because of
[23:42] that you have a certain direction or a
[23:44] certain passion.
[23:47] But many times God works and this is in
[23:52] that message the gifts and calling of
[23:54] God are without repentance. He said,
[23:57] "But many times God's workmen
[24:02] come just in a a different way to get
[24:07] and then he breaks this qu the sentence
[24:12] but perceiving
[24:15] uh but perceiving their thoughts." That
[24:18] was new
[24:21] perceiving their thoughts.
[24:23] And you perhaps don't even know when
[24:26] that is happening, but God might even be
[24:30] answering or ministering to something
[24:33] during the service. And while the word
[24:36] is preached,
[24:38] &gt;&gt; your thoughts are being perceived.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; And then God at a at some moment will
[24:46] awaken you and say, "Hey, that's exactly
[24:50] what I was thinking about." Well, what
[24:52] you want to do? You want to go back and
[24:54] see what he was saying about what you
[24:57] were thinking about.
[25:02] And he said,
[25:04] uh, but perceiving their thoughts, and
[25:08] he will reveal it to babes such as will
[25:12] learn.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; It can't be your own way, but he'll
[25:17] reveal it to babes such as we'll learn.
[25:21] And you, he said, you believe that?
[25:24] &gt;&gt; And then he makes a statement which I
[25:26] want you to remember. God will do it.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; God is the one. He lays the foundation.
[25:34] And if he doesn't lay a foundation in
[25:36] the person's life, there's nothing you
[25:39] can do about it. And the Bible says in
[25:43] first kings 5, "And the king, which was
[25:46] King Solomon, commanded, and they
[25:50] brought great stones,
[25:52] costly stones, and huge stones to the
[25:58] foundation
[25:59] of the house.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; It required those stones to be placed
[26:07] and fixed." And that's the first meaning
[26:09] really of
[26:12] ordination.
[26:14] Great stones, human stones, costly
[26:19] stones.
[26:20] It has nothing to do with the will of
[26:23] man. It has to do with the will of God.
[26:26] All the church world, all the
[26:28] organizations,
[26:30] they all have people they ordain.
[26:34] They just had a cardinal. I don't even
[26:37] mention this, but they just had a
[26:39] cardinal in Australia
[26:41] and he was sentenced to several years
[26:45] because he misused his office and abused
[26:49] some young men
[26:52] and he was a cardinal. He has appealed
[26:54] the case. This just happened.
[26:58] And he was sent to prison
[27:01] for six years. But I thought of how he
[27:05] uh
[27:07] you know I listened to the judge and
[27:10] they they were affected by his position.
[27:16] Man put him into that position. The pope
[27:19] even put him into that position. It
[27:21] doesn't matter uh if an archangel put
[27:25] you into a position if it's not
[27:26] according to the word of God. And I
[27:29] think of what the prophet of God said.
[27:31] He said he he said, "Did the angel of
[27:34] the Lord tell you to say that?" He said,
[27:37] "If the angel of the Lord told me
[27:39] something that wasn't in the word of
[27:42] God, I wouldn't believe him."
[27:45] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[27:49] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of message you can have
[27:51] confidence in. It's here in the word of
[27:55] God.
[27:58] And the king commanded that they brought
[28:01] great stones, costly stones, huge stones
[28:07] to lay the foundation of the house. It
[28:10] was the house of the Lord. And the Bible
[28:13] says in 1 Peter 2 and5,
[28:16] you also
[28:20] as lively stones,
[28:23] not dead stones, but lively stones
[28:27] are built up a spiritual house. And that
[28:31] who that will be who brother Ron Spencer
[28:35] is preaching to this morning, a lively
[28:39] house.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Hill and stones. It didn't come maybe
[28:43] easy, but they're human stones,
[28:47] &gt;&gt; costly stones,
[28:49] and then they're made to fit. And
[28:51] that'll be a foundation. And he says,
[28:55] build up a spiritual house and holy
[28:58] priesthood to offer
[29:01] up spiritual sacrifices
[29:05] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. And
[29:08] then Philippians says, "Brethren, I
[29:11] count myself
[29:14] to have apprehended
[29:18] uh I count myself
[29:22] to have apprehended, but this one thing
[29:25] I do, forgetting those things which are
[29:29] behind, and reaching forth unto those
[29:33] things which are before, I press toward
[29:38] the mark of the high calling. I believe
[29:41] that's one of the things that Brother
[29:44] Spencer began the service with on Friday
[29:46] night.
[29:48] Uh I press I want to say to you
[29:51] believers,
[29:53] your lively stones,
[29:56] you've been cut,
[29:58] you've been human.
[30:00] You've been made more valuable.
[30:03] You don't even understand when that is
[30:06] happening. May be happening in your
[30:09] school. May be happening as a child, may
[30:12] be happening as a young man or a young
[30:14] woman. And the prophet of God made
[30:18] reference to it. And I want you to be
[30:21] conscious of it this morning. You are
[30:24] lively stones. The ministry that stands
[30:28] behind this pulpit is for your benefit.
[30:32] And it's for it's sent for your sake
[30:35] because God has you in his thoughts in
[30:40] his mind. And there may be something yet
[30:43] that he wishes to do. And we say, "Thy
[30:47] will be done."
[30:48] &gt;&gt; G
[30:48] &gt;&gt; on earth and in earth
[30:51] &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven. Thy will be done.
[30:55] And he says, "Brethren,
[30:57] I count I count not myself to have
[31:02] apprehended,
[31:03] but this one thing I do, forgetting
[31:06] those things which are behind,
[31:10] and reaching forth
[31:13] unto those things, I press toward the
[31:17] mark of the high calling. There's a
[31:20] goal. I press toward the mark. I pursue
[31:24] it.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; I re I receive the challenge that God
[31:29] has put in my heart
[31:31] &gt;&gt; and I am pursuing it with all that's in
[31:34] me
[31:35] &gt;&gt; that I may attain that goal
[31:41] &gt;&gt; for the prize of the high calling. When
[31:45] you were called to this message,
[31:47] my friends, I I feel as though I'm up
[31:51] here. I have looked at these scriptures.
[31:54] I have pondered them. I have gone back
[31:57] and forth over them for several weeks.
[32:01] I press toward
[32:05] the mark. And the reason why you press
[32:07] is God the author
[32:10] in his predestinated plan. He put
[32:13] something in you that would cause you to
[32:17] keep pressing
[32:18] forward
[32:20] for the toward the mark, toward the
[32:22] goal. Don't miss it. You won't miss it
[32:27] toward the prize for the prize of the
[32:31] high calling of God. It's his call
[32:35] &gt;&gt; right
[32:36] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus.
[32:40] One who possesses
[32:42] the inner drive
[32:44] as a result of the call of God
[32:50] to seek after eagerly,
[32:53] earnestly
[32:55] endeavor to acquire. The call of God is
[32:59] very much misunderstood
[33:04] &gt;&gt; by most everyone including some who have
[33:07] been ordained.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; It's not a it's not a solve all. It
[33:13] isn't a fix all.
[33:16] It is that the even the man of God who
[33:21] stands to offer prayer for the ordaining
[33:26] of God's
[33:29] call called servant.
[33:32] You can't invent that. The call of God
[33:35] is very much misunderstood by most
[33:39] everyone
[33:40] including some that have been ordained
[33:44] to press. And this I want to go into
[33:47] just a wee bit, just a couple moments to
[33:50] press. What is that?
[33:53] What what what causes you to get up
[33:58] and say,
[34:01] "I'll continue on."
[34:03] &gt;&gt; What causes that? What is it in you that
[34:06] says, "I just can't
[34:09] I can't give it up. I can't throw the
[34:12] towel in.
[34:15] Brother Gunther, he's passed away just
[34:19] now recently. I phoned him once on a
[34:24] during the week and I said, "Brother
[34:26] Gunther, do you ever feel like giving up
[34:29] the ministry?" He said, "About once
[34:31] every Sunday."
[34:33] [laughter]
[34:36] I said, "Well, thanks for being
[34:37] truthful."
[34:39] said about once every Sunday,
[34:43] but he he would be there at the pulpit
[34:46] the next Sunday and the next one. Why?
[34:49] Because something was in inside driving
[34:54] him forward. He was eagerly eagerly
[34:59] looking forward to the prize of the high
[35:02] calling. He's gone to his reward.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:13] So it's not just someone that ministers
[35:16] and it's not someone who just preaches.
[35:20] It is something that is inside that is
[35:23] driving a person.
[35:27] Now I'm going to take you just on a
[35:29] quick curve.
[35:33] Samuel was sent with a horn horn of oil.
[35:37] to anoint
[35:39] a person
[35:42] and he said you go to the house of
[35:43] Jesse.
[35:45] So he went to h the house of Jesse and
[35:48] he had quite a few children.
[35:52] So he said [clears throat] Samuel said
[35:55] are here all thy children
[35:58] because each one that came know it's
[36:02] what was pressing him was saying inside
[36:05] it's not him.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; It's not him.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; It's not him. Fine young men, fine
[36:12] children.
[36:14] And and he said there remainth yet the
[36:19] youngest. And you know when I was
[36:22] pondering when the Holy Spirit was
[36:24] bringing this to me was in the wee hours
[36:27] of the morning.
[36:29] There's still one. The youngest is not
[36:33] here. And behold, he keepeth the sheep.
[36:38] And Samuel said unto Jesse, "Send and
[36:41] fetch him." They didn't send a
[36:44] Rolls-Royce.
[36:46] They didn't send an armored vehicle.
[36:50] They were bringing a man that was going
[36:52] to sing the psalms of the word of God.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; And he said he's out there with the
[37:03] sheep yet.
[37:05] And he said, "Go and fetch him,
[37:08] for we will not sit down till he come
[37:12] hither." Yeah.
[37:16] And he sent and brought him in.
[37:20] [clears throat]
[37:23] Now he who
[37:25] he was ready
[37:27] and with all of a beautiful
[37:32] complexion,
[37:34] countenance,
[37:36] and goodly to look at. That had nothing
[37:38] to do with it. And the Lord said, And
[37:42] the Lord said, "Arise,
[37:45] anoint him."
[37:47] This is him.
[37:51] That's the kind of laying down of a
[37:53] stone.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; That's essential.
[37:59] That's the foundation stone. That's not
[38:03] calling someone forward in all of their
[38:05] robes and
[38:07] and cute little hats and things. It has
[38:11] nothing to do with that. You can ordain
[38:14] a man can ordain men till they're blue
[38:17] in the face, but if it's not in here
[38:22] &gt;&gt; by a predestinated stone.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. And that person
[38:29] may well have attempted other things.
[38:42] You may even be blessed of God
[38:46] in other things. You may be blessed of
[38:48] God with skills
[38:51] that God will never use.
[38:54] You may be blessed of God of
[38:56] intelligence
[38:59] that God may or may not use. He may use
[39:02] it for a time to get you to a certain
[39:06] point and then turn a sharp corner.
[39:10] Believe me,
[39:13] I I speak as one of experience.
[39:18] He may
[39:20] bring you and drive you.
[39:25] I have a passion have had a passion for
[39:30] uh 40
[39:32] plus these 20 years, 60 years.
[39:37] I've had a passion.
[39:41] You have to forgive me for a moment,
[39:45] but that passion has been
[39:49] I've enjoyed this message.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; This is a man running from the presence
[39:55] of the Lord. But
[39:58] the message is the third Exodus.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Kinsman redeemer.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; I said, I have been so blessed. The
[40:08] mighty God unveiled. I've been so
[40:11] blessed
[40:13] &gt;&gt; and I've looked into the eyes of
[40:17] Africans
[40:20] and Indian brethren and sisters, been in
[40:23] their homes, slept in their beds.
[40:27] I did hear amongst the native Indian
[40:30] people, which they call indigenous first
[40:32] nations and all that lot.
[40:37] When they're amongst themselves, I hear
[40:39] what they call themselves.
[40:42] And I stayed in their rooms. And here in
[40:46] Cloverdale, we went to Uklit
[40:52] and I stayed on the native side
[40:57] with the Indian people because I had
[41:00] never stayed anywhere else. I had never
[41:03] stayed in a white motel. I stayed with
[41:06] them, ate their food,
[41:09] worshiped with them,
[41:12] prayed with them, and I became their
[41:16] friend indeed. And they are
[41:20] I can't describe.
[41:22] I tell you what, one native young man
[41:26] walked in here and kind of came to the
[41:28] forward and some deacons came forward.
[41:31] They didn't know whether he I was going
[41:33] to be attacked because we met right here
[41:36] and threw our arms around each other. He
[41:39] had I didn't pay the attention that he
[41:41] had long hair.
[41:44] I knew him when he was crippled
[41:47] in the hip from a shot from a gun.
[41:52] I I knew his background, etc., etc., but
[41:56] I loved him with an undying love.
[42:01] had a passion,
[42:03] brother Tim,
[42:06] to get this message into other
[42:09] languages.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; And I could not shake it.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; I apologized to the congregation here,
[42:20] but I want you to know I'm receiving
[42:23] letters almost every week.
[42:26] They're so thankful for the word that
[42:29] goes from this church, Brother Tom, and
[42:33] the ministry of the word that's
[42:36] ministered here and for our stand with
[42:39] the word. If you have ever grumbled over
[42:43] our stand with the word, you'll have to
[42:46] get somebody else to hear it because I
[42:49] can tell you that
[42:51] it will have no effect upon us
[42:55] because we're fighting a losing battle
[42:58] with something that's inside. It's
[43:01] called the seed of God.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; It's called the Holy Ghost. And we
[43:07] cannot we cannot uh change that.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; This morning
[43:16] this morning you're here at church.
[43:21] I was looking for Sister Annel
[43:24] from
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Africa.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Zimbabwe.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; She's in
[43:30] &gt;&gt; pardon.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; She's in Africa.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; She's left.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; She's in Africa.
[43:35] Well, I don't know.
[43:38] They feel that the whole nation is in
[43:42] starvation mode and they only have food
[43:46] to carry even the
[43:50] higherups.
[43:51] They'll only carry the nation till the
[43:54] end of February.
[43:56] They're without food.
[44:00] I'm so glad
[44:02] that in the 1980s
[44:06] I walked all over the place. I talked to
[44:09] people,
[44:11] found a place where they could print the
[44:13] message.
[44:17] They got to have maybe they haven't got
[44:20] race, but they've got to have this.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; They've got to have this word revealed
[44:26] to them.
[44:28] They have to have that. And then God,
[44:30] the God who wrote this,
[44:33] &gt;&gt; will provide for them
[44:36] &gt;&gt; because he promised to do that.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; If you'll pray for them.
[44:43] And I have one scripture and I'm going
[44:45] to
[44:48] call Michael if you'd like to come down.
[44:53] You have not chosen me,
[44:56] but I have chosen you. The scripture
[44:59] says, "And ordained you," and I'm
[45:02] referring to each one, [clears throat]
[45:05] that you should go and bring forth
[45:09] fruit,
[45:10] and that your fruit should remain,
[45:15] and whatsoever you shall ask
[45:19] in ask of the father in my name,
[45:24] he will do it.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Thus saith the Lord.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Shall we rise to our feet, please?
[45:45] you that are standing here in a couple
[45:47] moments
[45:49] maybe you're feeling I'm taking too
[45:51] [clears throat] much time but in a
[45:53] couple moments
[45:55] our brother Ron Spencer will speak to
[45:58] those
[46:00] that God has spoken to in this word
[46:07] and he said,
[46:11] "Also, I will ordain a place for my
[46:15] people Israel
[46:19] and will plant them,
[46:23] and they shall dwell
[46:27] there in peace, and dwell in their
[46:30] place,
[46:32] and
[46:34] shall be moved no more, neither Neither
[46:38] shall the children of the wickedness
[46:41] waste them anymore as at the beginning.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; The children of wickedness shall not
[46:50] move the people of God.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; They will not have an effect upon you.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; That's thus saith the word of God.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; I will do it.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; He will lay the foundation. He will do
[47:06] the necessary essential work. And this
[47:10] is not just some
[47:12] uh of my thoughts. This is his word.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; And with this I do you know why you're
[47:21] here?
[47:22] There's parts of this Bible
[47:26] that are waiting to be fulfilled.
[47:31] You know, when Samuel was saying, and
[47:33] this is what I was laying on the on my
[47:36] bed thinking,
[47:38] when Samuel was saying,
[47:43] he still had the oil in his hand.
[47:48] The oil to anoint someone.
[47:52] He said,
[47:54] "Do you have all your children here?" He
[47:57] was hearing something. Maybe he was
[47:59] hearing the singing of the Psalms,
[48:03] &gt;&gt; the glory
[48:04] &gt;&gt; and the worship to God that came out of
[48:08] David's mouth.
[48:12] He had to do that. That had to happen.
[48:16] David is in Kings. David is in
[48:19] Chronicles. Yeah,
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 just couldn't come
[48:25] &gt;&gt; by itself.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Where's your part?
[48:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; And after you eat and partake
[48:34] and that's what I was so I felt a
[48:38] commission of this entire congregation.
[48:43] Maybe you don't understand.
[48:49] you young men.
[48:52] I didn't have a profession.
[48:55] I didn't have much of an education. I
[48:57] didn't have a chance at it.
[49:02] I was poorly educated.
[49:06] I never finished high school.
[49:11] I understand my mother had grade two
[49:15] and died when she when I was six and a
[49:17] half.
[49:20] I never had access to dentists
[49:24] and to doctors
[49:26] and to people that
[49:29] every home needs. I didn't have access
[49:32] to it.
[49:36] I wandered
[49:39] from one camp to another, from one place
[49:42] to another. I'm not calling for your
[49:44] sympathy. God knew exactly where I was
[49:48] at.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; And I was learning exactly what I needed
[49:52] to learn. Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; And Sister Abigail, you're a a woman of
[49:57] the north,
[49:59] and God gave you exactly the upbringing
[50:03] &gt;&gt; that you need to be the wife
[50:08] of Michael.
[50:10] And when you're ironing that shirt,
[50:13] there will be many more like that.
[50:25] You're listening very close.
[50:28] My eldest daughter, Linda, is here.
[50:37] You'll allow me to be
[50:39] a little emotional at a moment, but many
[50:43] times
[50:45] when you are gathered with your
[50:46] families,
[50:49] I was not able to gather with my family
[50:53] and my daughter, our first to be born,
[50:58] was laying in a hospital here and had
[51:01] just had surgery.
[51:03] And she was under the
[51:06] under the uh
[51:11] &gt;&gt; anesthetic.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Anesthetic. Yeah, she was under
[51:16] anesthetic just coming out
[51:19] and we were rushing to the airport
[51:27] and my wife,
[51:29] God bless her,
[51:32] for a mother that bore that child.
[51:37] and she just coming out of the
[51:39] anesthetic and she said,
[51:41] "Look, no tubes."
[51:44] They had just pulled the tubes out and
[51:48] we said goodbye and went to the airport.
[51:53] I just met a sister this morning from
[51:56] South Africa. God bless you.
[51:59] I was in one of the ministers homes
[52:04] when a phone call came and somebody had
[52:08] traced me down and I went to the phone.
[52:12] They said, "Your stepmother had just
[52:14] passed away
[52:17] and her funeral will be on Friday or
[52:20] whatever day."
[52:23] And I said, "I just can't make it. I
[52:27] can't get back from South Africa
[52:32] to America in time.
[52:35] So, I was not here for my stepmom's
[52:38] funeral.
[52:41] Friends,
[52:43] those things do mean something.
[52:46] But when you've gone down the road a few
[52:48] years
[52:50] and you say, "Well, was it worth it?"
[52:55] Yeah, it was worth it.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; It was worth it.
[53:05] I thank God for his call on your life
[53:09] and that's why you're here.
[53:14] There are times maybe you would like to
[53:16] have thrown in the towel and quit.
[53:21] But there's something
[53:24] within you.
[53:26] It's called the Holy Ghost.
[53:30] It's not your human spirit. Your human
[53:33] spirit.
[53:34] You would have gone a different
[53:36] direction, Michael.
[53:39] Yeah. There's people you would have
[53:40] operated on as a doctor
[53:44] and you would have alleviated a lot of
[53:47] their trouble and pain
[53:49] perhaps. And there's others here, Sister
[53:53] Anna Hope,
[53:55] Sister Lisa,
[53:59] and there's others of you that could do
[54:03] a lot. And the prophet of God comes. Do
[54:06] you know what he says?
[54:09] He says
[54:12] they have hospitals
[54:14] and that's good.
[54:18] And some of the prophet's best friends
[54:20] were even Dr. Samadair.
[54:29] That's good.
[54:31] That's not
[54:33] That's not the highest calling.
[54:37] There's something still higher.
[54:42] And maybe you feel that even as brother
[54:45] Spencer is going to come and preach
[54:49] the higher calling.
[54:52] I wonder brother Michael if you'll come
[54:54] down and perhaps sister Abigail you'll
[54:57] come down with him
[54:59] because
[55:02] and we'll go down and pray, shall we?
[55:38] It's about ordination.
[55:41] And now we ask oh God.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; That you'll receive this couple
[55:47] &gt;&gt; for their
[55:50] &gt;&gt; work.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; That you have
[55:54] &gt;&gt; for them. For Sister Abigail,
[55:57] &gt;&gt; brother Michael.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; You put it in their heart. I want to
[56:01] help
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus. And I want to help my dad.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; In the ministry.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and and a great fear came
[56:10] upon his life.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I never wondered. I never
[56:15] wanted this."
[56:17] &gt;&gt; But he will not run from it
[56:20] &gt;&gt; because the call is too great
[56:23] &gt;&gt; and they're without repentance.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Ron Spencer, will you
[56:28] pray for them?
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Michael,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; I stood on a very supernatural night.
[56:39] This is a very spirit supernatural day
[56:43] &gt;&gt; and he's got great work to do.
[56:47] He has arranged this whole thing.
[56:52] Almighty God,
[56:53] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Th will be done.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, just now
[57:07] As I stood in a prayer line with Michael
[57:12] &gt;&gt; and your uncction came,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; I feel like Samuel and him
[57:19] &gt;&gt; pouring all on David.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Here we are three years later
[57:27] &gt;&gt; in this moment of time
[57:30] &gt;&gt; that blends with eternity.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. It's not what a man lays his
[57:35] hands on. It's what God lays his hands
[57:37] on.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; We're not interested in man's opinion.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; We're not even interested in a man's
[57:44] thoughts.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; But God, we give oursel to you just now.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; By the authority of the name of the Lord
[57:53] Jesus Christ,
[57:56] &gt;&gt; we recognize the gift that you placed in
[57:59] his life for the world. We recognize not
[58:02] just he but his wife.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, we stand on these sacred grounds
[58:09] right now.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Oh God, holy is the presence.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may the angel of the Lord
[58:17] &gt;&gt; even sanctioned this day in this moment.
[58:20] Father,
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you see the hardships, the
[58:26] difficulties,
[58:28] &gt;&gt; the literally endless hours of study,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; the prayer
[58:34] &gt;&gt; of great decisions, of circumstances,
[58:38] standing there,
[58:39] &gt;&gt; oh God,
[58:41] &gt;&gt; anointed for the purpose,
[58:43] &gt;&gt; oh God.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Oh God, and we as an audience
[58:48] recognize
[58:50] the the full circle
[58:53] &gt;&gt; of events now.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[58:56] &gt;&gt; and we stand with mighty men
[58:58] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Holy name.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask you now,
[59:02] &gt;&gt; all conquering men
[59:03] &gt;&gt; that you would take Michael.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[59:07] &gt;&gt; yes my
[59:09] &gt;&gt; use him for your service.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Not even for his service.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; This is not his gift. That's your gift.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. not his gift to abuse and use,
[59:21] &gt;&gt; but it's your gift
[59:23] &gt;&gt; to bless the body of Jesus Christ and
[59:27] edify.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; And Lord, may even the people that sat
[59:31] under to hear the word of God, may they
[59:34] realize that's coming from the very
[59:36] throne of God. Oh God,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; oh God, we just pray now.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[59:43] &gt;&gt; we thank you for these things.
[59:46] Thank you for this moment, Father.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; My God.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:40] Sing your song.
[1:00:43] This message makes music.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; You're the one that's going to make the
[1:00:49] music.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; The same as
[1:00:54] David. He had all that in him.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; It had to be in here.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; And the message is in here.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; But the revelation is in you. Yeah.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; And that's different. Sing your song.
[1:01:13] [music]
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Somebody's waiting to hear it.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] Amen.
[1:01:20] Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. God bless you. I [music] stand
[1:01:27] [singing] in all within
[1:01:31] [music]
[1:01:36] the wisdom [singing]
[1:01:37] of [music] the agees.
[1:01:44] Whom [music and singing] the raging of
[1:01:46] the sea
[1:01:49] subside,
[1:01:52] the living [singing]
[1:01:53] [music] sacrifice,
[1:01:57] the only source [music]
[1:02:00] of [singing] life.
[1:02:02] My
[1:02:05] is [music]
[1:02:08] in [singing] you.
[1:02:12] from this time on
[1:02:17] [music]
[1:02:19] [singing] my
[1:02:23] [music]
[1:02:24] Lord
[1:02:27] forever
[1:02:29] [music] more. [singing] His tender
[1:02:31] mercies,
[1:02:35] [music] His tender mercies [singing]
[1:02:37] come with every rising
[1:02:41] sun
[1:02:44] to [music] meet the senior
[1:02:47] [singing]
[1:02:50] [music]
[1:02:53] [singing]
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat.
[1:03:05] [singing]
[1:03:06] [music]
[1:03:10] Oh,
[1:03:14] [music]
[1:03:19] [singing]
[1:03:21] heat, [music]
[1:03:25] heat.
[1:03:27] [singing]
[1:03:30] [music]
[1:03:34] forever.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; What a great [music] day.
[1:03:48] Hallelujah.
[1:03:50] Brother Michael, it seems like we've
[1:03:52] made a full circle. And
[1:03:55] God bless you. Thank you, thank you for
[1:03:58] letting me be a part of that.
[1:04:01] Hallelujah.
[1:04:03] Hallelujah. We love you with all of our
[1:04:05] hearts and so good to see you this
[1:04:07] morning. And I'm just thankful that we
[1:04:10] we're just here.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've had a wonderful, wonderful
[1:04:15] time already.
[1:04:18] And today is a going to be a great day.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:24] I awoke this morning and I told Sister
[1:04:26] Connie, I said, "Today's a really great
[1:04:29] day for a believer and a really bad day
[1:04:32] for the devil."
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Without a whole lot
[1:04:39] of ado, I won't spend I won't I won't
[1:04:41] take long this morning and maybe we'll
[1:04:43] finish this evening. But I'm conscious
[1:04:46] of time, but I'm also conscious that I'm
[1:04:48] sent here to do a job,
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, [clears throat] you are. Amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I I just want to say something to
[1:04:56] you today.
[1:05:00] I'm not here for a notch on the belt.
[1:05:04] I'm not here to get clicks on an
[1:05:05] internet.
[1:05:07] And I'm not here for popularity.
[1:05:10] I'm here on a mission.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; And I want to come to your home.
[1:05:18] Many times
[1:05:20] I I say this, I'd like to come to your
[1:05:23] porch
[1:05:24] and drink coffee with you and eat some
[1:05:26] chocolates,
[1:05:29] but today I believe God's going to allow
[1:05:31] me to do that in another realm.
[1:05:35] And I'd like for you to be very
[1:05:37] conscious, if you if I can ask you to do
[1:05:40] that, be very conscious that I'm getting
[1:05:42] ready to come to your house.
[1:05:47] Not me personally,
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; but him
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; and he wants to speak to you.
[1:05:54] We are identified one time when Jesus
[1:05:59] was walking through a street
[1:06:03] and there was a lot of things going on
[1:06:05] around. Healings and miracles and faith
[1:06:08] was arising and people's expectations
[1:06:10] were in a lot of ways. And Jesus walks
[1:06:13] under a tree
[1:06:16] and there's a man there. Brother
[1:06:18] Brandham describes that man quite well
[1:06:21] and very vividly.
[1:06:23] And he called him by name and he said,
[1:06:26] "Zakius,
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; come down.
[1:06:30] I'm going to go home with you and eat
[1:06:32] with you."
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:34] to the neighborhood. They probably
[1:06:36] thought Jesus just picked the worst man
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; that he could have picked
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; and some call him a prophet and forgot
[1:06:45] the miracles that just happened.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; And Jesus goes to Zakius's house because
[1:06:54] he's a predestinated seat.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; And he goes to his house
[1:07:04] and he has lunch with him and they say a
[1:07:06] lot of things and he has lunch with him
[1:07:11] and Jesus's presence changed his life
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; just his presence changed his life
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; in the coming days he would restore
[1:07:25] and he would become a different kind of
[1:07:27] a man
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; and his whole life would change
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why Jesus came to his
[1:07:33] house.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; I'd like to invite you to prayer now.
[1:07:42] And I want you personally,
[1:07:46] don't invite him to somebody else's
[1:07:48] house. I want you to personally invite
[1:07:51] him to your house.
[1:07:53] I want to invite him to your pew just
[1:07:56] now.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Could you do that with me by a raise of
[1:07:59] hands all across this audience?
[1:08:02] Amen. Amen.
[1:08:06] Almighty God, we bow our heads before
[1:08:08] you now.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for these events
[1:08:12] already this morning.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; It's a culmination of
[1:08:19] of many things.
[1:08:21] And we have saw your supernatural hand.
[1:08:26] It's not passed on by natural lineage.
[1:08:29] And
[1:08:31] no doubt in many times circles people
[1:08:33] say, "Well, that's just the family.
[1:08:36] That's just the family moving on."
[1:08:39] But God, you you're the caller.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; You're the ordainer.
[1:08:47] And just as much as Michael has stood
[1:08:49] here before with Abigail and no doubt
[1:08:53] neither wanted to be in this position a
[1:08:57] few years ago, but today here they
[1:09:00] stand.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; God, you have gathered us from all
[1:09:03] realms of the earth.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; And years ago, we would have probably no
[1:09:08] doubt picked this way, but you picked
[1:09:10] it, Father.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; You called and you placed it. Decisions
[1:09:16] were made, choices were made, and
[1:09:20] and Lord, we can truly say this. You've
[1:09:22] been with us all our lives.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, as I have studied and you
[1:09:30] have laid this on my heart now, knowing
[1:09:33] I was coming to this spot this morning,
[1:09:37] Lord, this morning, I pray that you
[1:09:39] would take these words.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:42] Lord, hide me behind a curtain if it may
[1:09:45] be.
[1:09:47] I don't want people to attach to my
[1:09:49] personality. I want them to attach to
[1:09:51] you
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; and recognize that you are in this
[1:09:55] building,
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Lord. If I can say this in its correct
[1:09:59] way, the angel of God is here,
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Father. and may you search through our
[1:10:06] lives and minister to our hearts,
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, for the purpose that we might be
[1:10:13] greater used,
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, that we would lay aside every
[1:10:17] weight,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; every sin.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Create a passion and a desire in us like
[1:10:24] never before.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, may we commit everything to you
[1:10:29] this morning.
[1:10:31] Father, forgive us of every mistake and
[1:10:34] every failure.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you take the tongs from off
[1:10:39] of the altar. Take that live coal and
[1:10:43] lay on our our lips now. Not just our
[1:10:46] lips, but our whole life.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; We wholly consecrate oursel to you now.
[1:10:53] Give oursel to you. May unbelief leave
[1:10:56] this building.
[1:10:58] I give you freedom to leave this
[1:11:00] building
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you. If
[1:11:10] you will turn with me in your scriptures
[1:11:12] this morning. [snorts]
[1:11:15] I would like to go to second Kings
[1:11:17] chapter 5
[1:11:21] and verse one
[1:11:23] and then to Luke 4 and verse 23.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:37] Second Kings chapter 5 and verse one.
[1:11:44] Thank you for the opportunity to stand
[1:11:46] before you. And I apologize that
[1:11:50] brother Tom's not speaking or brother
[1:11:52] Ed's not speaking or these other guys
[1:11:54] are not speaking, but you know, maybe
[1:11:57] maybe I can say something that'll bless
[1:12:00] your heart.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:05] [clears throat and cough]
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Now non
[1:12:09] captain of the host of the king of Syria
[1:12:12] was a great man with his master
[1:12:17] and honorable
[1:12:20] because by him the Lord had given
[1:12:24] deliverance
[1:12:25] unto Syria. There's some incredible
[1:12:28] words said there.
[1:12:31] He has been used to fulfill the vision
[1:12:35] of the word of God.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; He is honorable.
[1:12:41] He's a great man. Now, God saying this
[1:12:44] about him, right?
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be written down in
[1:12:47] eternal word.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; This is what the caliber of a man that
[1:12:51] he was.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; He was also a mighty man in valor.
[1:12:58] But notice these next words.
[1:13:01] But he was a leper.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; In Luke 4 verse 23,
[1:13:10] Jesus will recall this from the word.
[1:13:15] And Jesus is speaking. And he said unto
[1:13:17] them, you will surely say unto me this
[1:13:21] proverb, physician, heal thyself.
[1:13:26] whatsoever you have heard done in
[1:13:28] Capernaum, do also hear in thy country.
[1:13:32] And he and he said, verily I say unto
[1:13:35] you, no prophet is accepted in his own
[1:13:38] country.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; But I tell you of a truth. Many widows
[1:13:44] were in Israel in the days of Elias.
[1:13:48] And the when the heavens was shut up
[1:13:51] three years and six months, when great
[1:13:53] famine was throughout all the land,
[1:13:58] but none of them
[1:14:00] was Elias sent, say Sarapa, the city of
[1:14:05] Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.
[1:14:10] And many lepers were in Israel in the
[1:14:12] time of Elias
[1:14:14] the prophet. And none of them was
[1:14:17] cleansed
[1:14:19] saving non
[1:14:21] the Syrian.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:14:29] [snorts]
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; I know this is a very simple story, but
[1:14:40] it it can get real complex. So, if
[1:14:43] you'll just kind of give me a few
[1:14:45] moments to to speak it to you.
[1:14:49] Non being a great man,
[1:14:53] had a position,
[1:14:55] had great authority,
[1:14:58] he was recognized as a as as the captain
[1:15:02] of the host.
[1:15:04] He would be the five-star general.
[1:15:07] He would be kind of what Iran is is
[1:15:11] mourning today, a general that has been
[1:15:14] killed. And I'm not getting into
[1:15:16] politics, but they they looked to that
[1:15:19] sort of a man as a great man.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; This was a kind of a man that lived on a
[1:15:26] on a kind of a higher level. He people
[1:15:29] reverenced him. People watched him and
[1:15:31] they made over him. He was a man that
[1:15:35] had great authority with his tongue and
[1:15:37] with his with his words, with his
[1:15:39] speeches. He was a man that was what you
[1:15:43] might say
[1:15:44] greatly hailed as a great hero.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; He will be the man that will fulfill the
[1:15:52] scripture of Ahab's death. And he'll be
[1:15:56] the man that that will liberate
[1:15:59] Syria.
[1:16:00] And as a liberator, people want to
[1:16:03] worship him. No doubt making statues to
[1:16:05] him and spots in museums. He's a living
[1:16:08] legend now.
[1:16:10] Everybody is just completely
[1:16:13] completely enamored with his presence.
[1:16:16] You know, you just don't walk into the
[1:16:18] king and have an audience with him when
[1:16:20] you want to. But when you're a man named
[1:16:23] Non,
[1:16:25] you can do such
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; interact with the upper echelon of the
[1:16:30] city,
[1:16:32] look to them and be able to to
[1:16:34] correspond with them. and you're the man
[1:16:37] that kind of everybody looks to.
[1:16:40] But Non was a different sort of fella.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; You see, he could
[1:16:47] he he carried something in his body that
[1:16:51] was a secret.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Only the inner realm of his home would
[1:16:57] know this
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; because to be a leper
[1:17:02] would take him into exile.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:17:06] as a leopard in that day. They they
[1:17:08] placed them on islands or places away or
[1:17:11] communities away amongst leper colonies
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; because of the rotting of the flesh, the
[1:17:18] stench, the pulls, the the muscle
[1:17:22] deterioration,
[1:17:24] the literally limbs would fall off and
[1:17:28] hard conditions. That's right.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; This man was able to keep this
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; from the public eye.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; This man was able to hide it and hold it
[1:17:44] very secretly.
[1:17:48] And then he's holding it very secretly.
[1:17:51] You know, everybody knows at home.
[1:18:01] You see a lot of times many people look
[1:18:04] out like on the outside as great
[1:18:06] overcomers.
[1:18:09] They can quote the message lyrics
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; almost by heart. Dress the part.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Look like great heroes.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Look great to the community, the society
[1:18:22] and other other families and patrons and
[1:18:25] many of you that I'm sitting here and I
[1:18:27] don't have anyone pointed out but God
[1:18:29] sure does.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And and to look and to see you. I I'd
[1:18:35] like to be like that home. I'd like my
[1:18:37] family to be like that family. I'd like
[1:18:39] for I'd like for for my myself to be
[1:18:42] like that. Not knowing
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; that there's a secret.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; That elephant that is in the room
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; that nobody talks about.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I preach this at my home
[1:19:00] church, too. [snorts]
[1:19:04] If you can just relax a moment with me,
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; there was an answer in his house.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; You see, when he was away at war,
[1:19:17] he he took some treasures
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; and in the treasures, he took a girl.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham will begin to share
[1:19:26] some things with us. They had a little
[1:19:29] girl there.
[1:19:31] I want to show you the force of a
[1:19:33] testimony of a child.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Who lived in a nation perhaps a family
[1:19:38] who was under the influence of God. She
[1:19:40] loved her master. She loved her
[1:19:42] mistress. And when she seen Nab's non
[1:19:47] probably a good-hearted naturatured man
[1:19:49] as we know according to history, Elijah
[1:19:52] had never healed of a man of leprosy.
[1:19:55] There had never been a leper case in his
[1:19:57] day. Right.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And the little girl being raised under
[1:20:01] the influence over in Israel,
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; yet an alien,
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; she was conducting herself as a
[1:20:09] believer.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And that's the way that we should do all
[1:20:12] the time is conduct ourselves, no matter
[1:20:15] what our position is, conduct oursel as
[1:20:17] a believer,
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; ready at all times to give an answer for
[1:20:21] the hope that lith within you.
[1:20:26] This little girl had been taken captive,
[1:20:28] not of her own will.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; She had been taken captive
[1:20:33] by the captain, not a sergeant, the
[1:20:35] captain of the host.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Brought into his home.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; No doubt treated good, but it wasn't
[1:20:41] home.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; No doubt it was a nice home, but it
[1:20:44] wasn't home. No doubt she ate good food,
[1:20:47] but it wasn't home.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; No doubt they begin to love her, but it
[1:20:51] wasn't home. He wasn't father. She
[1:20:54] wasn't mother. There wasn't family. She
[1:20:57] wasn't home.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; But she found a spot in their life
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; to where that they trusted her.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; She became the the little lady in the
[1:21:08] home that did so much many things.
[1:21:12] But being a captive, she had to deal
[1:21:14] with some things.
[1:21:16] Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; She would see non as he walked in and
[1:21:21] take his armor off.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Take his shields and take all of that
[1:21:27] off. And he would go be from being the
[1:21:31] captain
[1:21:33] to daddy,
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; captain to the husband.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Captain to the man in the home.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Major difference. Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Out there, everybody worshiped him in
[1:21:50] here. He was a man with leprosy
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; and he would start unwrapping himself.
[1:21:56] No doubt the stench and the ooze and the
[1:21:59] bass and the and the all the different
[1:22:01] kind of things that they would try to
[1:22:02] do. Let me just say for him to go to the
[1:22:05] local doctor would out him.
[1:22:09] for him to go to to some physician to
[1:22:12] try to get himself help would tell the
[1:22:15] whole community
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; non was a leper. Amen.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; You can read history. Once you was found
[1:22:22] out as a leper, you were exiled. Brother
[1:22:24] Tim,
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; you know you work you work in India.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You have to leave your family. Listen,
[1:22:31] nobody wants to leave your family.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to destroy your family.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to come come to a spot to
[1:22:41] where that that you you want your whole
[1:22:44] family exposed.
[1:22:47] Nobody wants that. I understand that.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; But he was suffering with the disease of
[1:22:53] leprosy that was taking his life and
[1:22:56] taking everything about him.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; He didn't have an answer.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; I'd say that's a lot like sin. Sometimes
[1:23:06] sin will creep into lives unbeknownst,
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; maybe innocent at a bit, and before long
[1:23:14] it attaches itself to you, no matter how
[1:23:17] great a warrior you are.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; And before long, because of as it moves
[1:23:24] in, it sells itself so well. Before
[1:23:27] long, your prayer life's gone, your
[1:23:29] dedication's gone, the tapes are gone.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; The moral factors begin to leave. And
[1:23:35] before long, if you're not careful, in
[1:23:37] the public eye, you're living one way.
[1:23:40] And in the private world,
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; God knows.
[1:23:52] Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; We get so so
[1:23:56] uh consumed by people spying in on us.
[1:24:00] We get consumed by cameras everywhere.
[1:24:04] You know, we live in a society of facial
[1:24:07] recognition. And
[1:24:10] uh they know everywhere we're at, what
[1:24:12] we're doing, what we buy, what we sell,
[1:24:15] what we're interested in. Our
[1:24:18] conversation becomes our next email.
[1:24:22] It just seems like everything is just
[1:24:24] just known about you.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Well, that's not anything new.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Satan didn't come up with that.
[1:24:33] [clears throat]
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; He gets credit for being of the tree of
[1:24:35] knowledge, but he he didn't come up with
[1:24:37] that. God knows everything.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; He knows every situation of our life,
[1:24:44] the desires, the the patterns of our
[1:24:46] lives. He knows everything. He designed
[1:24:49] the predestinated seed that laid on the
[1:24:52] side of you and knew your strain of your
[1:24:55] humanity
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; of the difficulties that you would deal
[1:25:00] with because of the passing from
[1:25:02] generation to generation and all of
[1:25:05] their qualities would fall down on top
[1:25:06] of you.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; And if I could just speak, sometimes we
[1:25:12] just need to be honest with oursel. We
[1:25:14] don't have the answer. That's right.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; There's no doctor we can go to, no
[1:25:18] psychologist we can go to.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; We are in a day to where people want to
[1:25:27] discredit credit the humanity of of our
[1:25:31] prophet.
[1:25:32] [snorts]
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; He was honest with us.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; He was very honest with us and he he was
[1:25:38] overly honest with us.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; True. But if that same microscope could
[1:25:44] be used on you,
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; I get a little infuriated and you
[1:25:49] forgive me. I get a little I'm 5'5, so
[1:25:53] so I have got a shorter fuse,
[1:25:57] but I get a little infuriated that
[1:25:59] people want to put a microscope on
[1:26:00] brother Brandham and not put it on their
[1:26:02] self.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:26:12] [clears throat]
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; And if we can look at brother Brandham
[1:26:14] would have been a murderer had God not
[1:26:17] stopped him.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; He would have shot those boys had God
[1:26:21] not stopped him. But God had a greater
[1:26:23] work.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; God wasn't looking at his human
[1:26:27] mistakes.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Because there's a blood that was
[1:26:32] applied.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:26:39] I think in the Old Testament sometimes
[1:26:41] as you're as if you being the writer
[1:26:44] that you've got to write certain parts
[1:26:47] in.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; I'm the meakest man of the earth.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And knowing who you are,
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; a temper caused me not to go into the
[1:27:01] promised land.
[1:27:04] There's some parts of David that he I'm
[1:27:06] sure he wish was not written.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; But they desired to live in a temple,
[1:27:16] not a temple made with hands, but they
[1:27:18] desired to live in a body to where that
[1:27:21] there would be something there.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; That would take dominion over the lust
[1:27:28] that they felt.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; They had a sacrifice. They had a blood
[1:27:33] of the bulls and goats, but it didn't
[1:27:35] change their nature.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; No, it didn't.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; But they served a holy God
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; that no doubt that expressed his love to
[1:27:44] each and every one of them. And I'm
[1:27:46] being very generic now, but express his
[1:27:49] love. And they fulfilled prophecy and
[1:27:51] visions and they overcame wars. But they
[1:27:55] desired
[1:27:57] a change in their life
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; to be restored and walk like Adam did in
[1:28:03] the Garden of Eden. What Adam stepped
[1:28:06] out of, we want to step into.
[1:28:17] [snorts]
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; This little girl, she had the power to
[1:28:21] deliver him.
[1:28:23] If we could just take it just for a
[1:28:25] moment. This little girl had to overcome
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; and forgive him for taking her captive.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; She had to deal with,
[1:28:36] yes, he's my captor.
[1:28:39] Yes, he has ruled over me. He's been
[1:28:41] good to me. But I could withhold
[1:28:45] deliverance from him.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to just think. She's a
[1:28:49] young lady.
[1:28:51] And as a young lady, she's heard about
[1:28:54] incredible miracles,
[1:28:56] the power of God working through her
[1:28:58] prophet,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; and he has never healed a leper.
[1:29:08] But her faith
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; though she be an alien, her faith was
[1:29:18] great enough in the God of the prophet
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; that could take him into that realm
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; to where that he could be healed.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Though it had never been done,
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; though it was the most dreaded disease
[1:29:35] that there ever was.
[1:29:39] And so she challenged him, "If you could
[1:29:42] get to my prophet,
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; If you could get to my prophet,
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; are you with me now?" What a
[1:29:53] prescription that she's giving. if you
[1:29:55] could get to my prophet.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; You as an audience have been wonderfully
[1:30:01] set for decades
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; with one that sat on a log with a
[1:30:06] prophet.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; You you've heard the stories.
[1:30:12] But listen, God wants to do more than
[1:30:14] just give you stories.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; We're not discrediting that. Whatever.
[1:30:18] He wants that same God,
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; that same passion
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; that was in the prophet that's in your
[1:30:26] pastor,
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; that's in the ministry here, that
[1:30:30] [screaming] same God wants to live in
[1:30:32] your home.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; And if I may say this preemptively,
[1:30:38] leprosy of sin does not have to have
[1:30:41] dominion over your life.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; We have a prophet in Israel.
[1:30:57] And if you could get to him, I believe
[1:31:00] you'd be well.
[1:31:09] Do you know what this entails?
[1:31:15] This entails that I have to go to an
[1:31:17] enemy nation.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; This entails that I'm just not anybody.
[1:31:28] I'm a general.
[1:31:32] So, I could be an act in a war
[1:31:37] if I just, you know, where I go.
[1:31:39] Everybody knows where I'm at. If I go,
[1:31:43] you know, don't doubt there's a lot of
[1:31:44] so-called prophets here, but you're
[1:31:46] saying if I go to him, I'll be well. So,
[1:31:50] I've got to discredit all of these
[1:31:51] people.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Now, he begins to blend
[1:31:59] the will of God for a bit.
[1:32:03] I'll go on my own terms.
[1:32:06] I think that's sometimes how people come
[1:32:08] to Christ.
[1:32:10] They want to do it on their own terms.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; They know that this is a recipe that
[1:32:15] produces wonderful families.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; They they know this is a recipe that has
[1:32:22] supernatural things that you can't
[1:32:24] explain.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Some things you'll never understand.
[1:32:29] You just you just never be able to put a
[1:32:31] real thumb on it. This this is exactly
[1:32:34] how it happened.
[1:32:36] I don't know how you take 10% and you go
[1:32:39] much further than 100%.
[1:32:43] I
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; I'll take care of your finances if you
[1:32:45] put me first. I'll take care of your
[1:32:47] family if you commit me and make me
[1:32:49] first place. Listen, you can't you can't
[1:32:51] come up with a formula that in that.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; I know you got a wonderful school, but
[1:32:57] there's not a formula for what God does.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:07] First of all, he had to come to grips
[1:33:09] with
[1:33:10] I can't live with this sin anymore.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Leprosy anymore.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; I I can't live with this sin anymore. A
[1:33:20] leprosy anymore.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; I'm done with it.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; I've come to the end of it. It's rained
[1:33:26] over my life. No matter if I was winning
[1:33:29] a battle and I was cutting somebody's
[1:33:31] head off, still there was leprosy.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; When I unwrapped it, I smelled it. When
[1:33:37] I walked down the street, I had to make
[1:33:38] sure that nobody could smell the sin
[1:33:40] that was in my life. I had to make sure
[1:33:42] that I was clothed in a way to know
[1:33:44] where nobody.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; I had to make sure nobody knew what I
[1:33:50] was.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; But now a little girl in my home is
[1:33:54] challenging me.
[1:33:58] There's a prophet that's got an answer
[1:34:00] for you.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; There's a message that's got an answer
[1:34:05] for you. You don't have to live with
[1:34:07] pornography. You don't have to live with
[1:34:09] drugs. You don't have to live with
[1:34:11] running around on your wife or your
[1:34:13] husband.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; And the list is endless.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; But you don't have to live with sin in
[1:34:22] your life.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; I've been a while around a while now.
[1:34:43] One day I was sitting on a porch with a
[1:34:45] man. I was sitting with several
[1:34:47] brothers.
[1:34:49] I was sitting on the porch with a man
[1:34:51] and he was sitting beside of me and I
[1:34:54] was just sitting there and I just laid
[1:34:55] my hand over on his
[1:34:58] leg and
[1:35:00] I said, "When are you going to get rid
[1:35:02] of that little habit?"
[1:35:08] And he just looked at me like,
[1:35:13] "What happened?" I said, 'You know, I
[1:35:15] know what happened.
[1:35:19] When are you going to get rid of it?
[1:35:22] He said, ' Nobody knows.' I said, 'I
[1:35:24] do.'
[1:35:26] And I said, God just spoke it to me.
[1:35:30] When are you going to get rid of that?
[1:35:33] And he said, it's not hurting nobody. I
[1:35:35] said, really?
[1:35:42] Said, no.
[1:35:43] I said, "Your children know
[1:35:48] their children watch you put it in your
[1:35:50] mouth."
[1:35:55] I said, "You'll grow up. Their children
[1:35:57] will grow up. If you don't get rid of
[1:35:59] it, that little old habit will stay
[1:36:01] there and your children will grow up for
[1:36:04] a while. And once they get about this
[1:36:05] big,
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; you'll start wanting to correct them.
[1:36:11] Yeah.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And then they'll just look at you
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; and go, "You didn't overcome
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; and before long there'll be demons in
[1:36:27] your house you can't control."
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; I said, "Let me just go just a little
[1:36:31] bit further.
[1:36:33] Let me just prophesy to you. There will
[1:36:36] come a time when your children are gone.
[1:36:38] your wife will leave and she'll take
[1:36:40] another man.
[1:36:44] Now I'm almost 30 years some from that
[1:36:46] event
[1:36:50] and his children are gone
[1:36:53] and his children fight with complexes
[1:36:56] and I prayed for them in prayer lines
[1:36:59] and because the father
[1:37:03] didn't commit
[1:37:05] they struggle.
[1:37:08] This ain't a good time to lock down.
[1:37:12] His
[1:37:16] wife
[1:37:18] did exactly that. Gone.
[1:37:21] But it could have all been fixed,
[1:37:23] brother Tim.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; By taking hands of a brothers and
[1:37:27] saying, "I'm naming and I need to come
[1:37:29] clean
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; but you see, you got to go from hiding
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; to saying, "I need help." Amen.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, did brother Tom talk to
[1:37:46] you? I didn't even tell brother Tom what
[1:37:48] I was preaching this morning.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; You didn't talk to me. You've been
[1:37:53] overseas. Have you talked to your wife?
[1:38:02] I had someone else talking to me.
[1:38:07] Amen.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; And non come to a spot to where I got to
[1:38:15] risk it all to get help.
[1:38:19] Now, it may be on the internet, but
[1:38:20] somebody may be sitting on the couch
[1:38:22] going, "Okay, it's time.
[1:38:25] I can't live a double life anymore,
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; and I'm tired of living a double life,
[1:38:32] and I got to have help. I got some good
[1:38:35] news for you. I'm not a little girl in a
[1:38:37] in a captive situation.
[1:38:41] I'm a man of God standing commissioned
[1:38:43] by the word of God.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; There's a blood here for you.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; You can leave this service completely
[1:38:51] different than you walked in.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Change can be gone. Prison doors be
[1:38:58] opened up.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And walk out of here free.
[1:39:09] Brother Go, one of his dying requests to
[1:39:11] me was, "My son Isaiah
[1:39:14] would come to the Lord last night in
[1:39:17] Belgium. I got I got text all night
[1:39:21] long. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free."
[1:39:25] Isaiah came to the Lord.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He came to the season
[1:39:34] of his life that he couldn't live that
[1:39:35] way no more.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; And he found out there's a blood that'll
[1:39:42] take care of that.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:49] [snorts]
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Non sent
[1:39:54] letter to the king. He went to the king.
[1:39:57] I cannot imagine the conversation that
[1:40:00] he had to have with the king in a very
[1:40:02] private moment. You're talking about
[1:40:04] humiliation, intimidation,
[1:40:07] but he obviously did it with an
[1:40:09] attitude.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz attitude's everything.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; An attitude of
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; I need help.
[1:40:24] But even in this attitude, he wanted to
[1:40:26] do it his own way. [snorts]
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to preach to you.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; This is not your own way gospel.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; I could care less about your bank
[1:40:37] account.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; I could care less about what you drive.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; I could care less of what your PhDs if
[1:40:45] you've got enough degrees on there to on
[1:40:47] your wall to have a thermometer.
[1:40:50] I'm not interested in none of that.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; It does not impress me.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; But are you right with God?
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in your name. Are you
[1:41:04] right with God?
[1:41:15] created a letter
[1:41:17] to have an audience with the prophet.
[1:41:22] Instead of going to the prophet, he went
[1:41:23] to the king.
[1:41:27] You know, sometimes in doing it your own
[1:41:30] way,
[1:41:31] it's kind of like
[1:41:35] brother Ram had to explain to us
[1:41:38] that God has a way
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; and it's got to be that way.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; And he describes to us, lean not to your
[1:41:46] own understanding.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; He sermon after sermon, he drives it.
[1:41:52] It's not your way, it's his way.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And so he sends a letter to the king and
[1:42:03] then he goes to the king.
[1:42:06] You know, God's not interested in
[1:42:08] parades.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; He's just not even interested in
[1:42:12] parades.
[1:42:14] So, he's able to cross borders, go to
[1:42:17] the king. He is able to work it out. And
[1:42:20] when he comes to the king, the king
[1:42:23] hears about it. And this man being of
[1:42:25] this stature and having this kind of a
[1:42:27] history,
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; he rents his clothes.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "I can't do this. There's never
[1:42:34] been a leper healed
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; and you're bringing leprosy to me.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; You have walked into my castle with
[1:42:45] leprosy. You brought it to me.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You brought death to me.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Do we not understand as a family, as
[1:42:54] homes, as structures, of churches, do we
[1:42:57] not understand that sin will destroy us?
[1:43:00] And brother man said, "You must destroy
[1:43:02] it before it destroys you."
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, in your mind's eye, what
[1:43:10] are you thinking preaching a sermon like
[1:43:12] this? This is a good way to start out a
[1:43:14] new year. [applause]
[1:43:18] You may have stumbled through last year
[1:43:20] and by grace you are still sitting here.
[1:43:23] But let me just say you can walk in
[1:43:25] victory.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; I may be only preaching to one but I'm
[1:43:28] preaching to that one.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz all of you been there.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; 100% has been here.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; 100%. I don't care what your name is.
[1:43:42] I'm not impressed.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; All of us. Yes,
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; had been right here.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; We needed to get to the prophet.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Found out where he was at. He made his
[1:44:00] way. Elijah sent word to the king.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Send him on.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Send him on. You're not going to You're
[1:44:07] not going to do any good down there.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; You're in the king's castle. You're not
[1:44:11] going to get healed. Here's where you
[1:44:13] got to get healed.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Right. Let me just say, here's where the
[1:44:16] rapture's at.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Here's where the resurrection's at. You
[1:44:21] can d all [screaming] all you want to
[1:44:23] out there.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Had a man walk up and hand me his card
[1:44:32] just a few moments ago. He's a preacher.
[1:44:34] He's preaching a meeting here here in
[1:44:35] this deal. Come from from Dawson Creek.
[1:44:38] and he just walked right straight up to
[1:44:39] me and an elderly man and introduced
[1:44:42] himself and and we began to talk for a
[1:44:44] few moments and and he and he was he's
[1:44:47] preaching a prescription this morning
[1:44:48] somewhere. I looked at his wife.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; That's all I needed to see.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; He needs this message.
[1:44:59] I told him you might what what what we
[1:45:01] have you might want to look on the
[1:45:02] website here the
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; I didn't have an hour to talk to him.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Come and see.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Come and see.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Come and see.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said if you go to a
[1:45:18] doctor
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; he said you got to trust that doctor.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; He writes you a prescription. You got to
[1:45:22] trust that prescription.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; And he said you take it home you got to
[1:45:26] take it. Right.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; A lot of people want to sit in a pew
[1:45:30] with it.
[1:45:35] [snorts]
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hollywood does not have all the Oscar
[1:45:38] winners.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, Hollywood don't
[1:45:45] have nothing
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; on a lot of church people.
[1:45:57] I've met people that said, "I I'd like
[1:45:59] to been with the prophet." And I just
[1:46:00] say, "No, you wouldn't."
[1:46:06] Cuz you're not ready to meet God yet.
[1:46:11] Don't take that in the wrong way. But if
[1:46:13] I can see through you,
[1:46:21] [snorts]
[1:46:27] I could imagine as the servants now knew
[1:46:29] that non was
[1:46:32] [snorts] a leper,
[1:46:34] their faith now is if we can get him
[1:46:38] to the prophet, he'll be well. Our fears
[1:46:41] will be gone.
[1:46:45] If I can get my daddy into the presence
[1:46:46] of the Lord, my mother in the presence
[1:46:48] of the Lord, that alcohol and that porn
[1:46:50] and and all that, if if he could just
[1:46:52] really instead of just going to church,
[1:46:54] get it.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Things will be different at home.
[1:46:57] Devotions will be different at home.
[1:47:07] [snorts] Interesting thing happens when
[1:47:09] they finally arrive at the prophet's
[1:47:10] house.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; you know, he's used to he's used to red
[1:47:16] carpet treatment.
[1:47:18] He's been to a lot of houses.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; He's used to maybe a dinnerer
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; and the best of a dinner.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; He's used to having the best seat in the
[1:47:28] house. He's he's used to being
[1:47:30] applauded. He's used to be being a lot
[1:47:32] of things, treated a certain way, bowed
[1:47:34] to.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; He's used to a lot of a lot of
[1:47:36] dignities. Right.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; But when he comes to the prophet's
[1:47:40] house,
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; prophet don't even come out.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Knowing he's coming, send a letter, told
[1:47:46] him to come.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Prophet don't even come out. He sends
[1:47:50] his servant out.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Told him what he was there for. The
[1:48:03] servant goes in and I can just imagine
[1:48:06] him looking at his people. Well, this is
[1:48:09] some sort of a treatment.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; The servant comes out and says, "The
[1:48:17] prophet said to go wash in Jordan
[1:48:22] and dip seven times.
[1:48:30] Amen.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Now he begins to talk about the
[1:48:36] ingredients of the message.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Do I have to go to church?
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Do I have to wear dresses?
[1:48:53] Do I have to
[1:48:55] clean everything out?
[1:49:00] If I'm going to wash, I'd like to wash
[1:49:03] in the beautiful Mediterranean pools.
[1:49:07] If it's requiring washing,
[1:49:10] I I I'd like to wash in a more dignified
[1:49:13] spot,
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; You know, I don't I don't need a guy
[1:49:18] with a no education. I I need a doctor
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; speaking to me, you know, that'll use
[1:49:23] liy words.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:49:29] [sighs and gasps]
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; He got mad.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; He got mad at the message of the hour.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; He got mad at his cure.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; So at this spot, he loved the leprosy
[1:49:45] more than he did the word of God.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; And he had come to a spot, now he's
[1:49:52] arguing. He's having a temper tantrum.
[1:49:55] He's in that moment. Do I die out or do
[1:49:58] I do I continue with sin or
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; he had some good counsel around him.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Said just do what the prophet said.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Listen, don't argue with this message.
[1:50:11] Just do what it said.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; You don't have to read nothing into it.
[1:50:16] Just believe what it said. It's simple.
[1:50:22] temple.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Someone sat at my table the other day
[1:50:31] and they were sitting there and said,
[1:50:32] "What an incredible family. How lucky
[1:50:34] you must be." And I looked at them. I
[1:50:36] said, "This has nothing to do with
[1:50:37] luck."
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Never been an argument at this table.
[1:50:44] This our table has the capacity to set
[1:50:46] 18. We have 16 seats. Well, it it's
[1:50:49] never had an open argument at that
[1:50:50] table. Never.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Never.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Never had an open argument.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; I've never had a continuous contentious
[1:50:57] moment to to where somebody got up and
[1:50:59] mad and walked out of the It's never
[1:51:01] happened at that table.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; It don't happen at a home.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; That home is a is a sanctuary to where I
[1:51:10] can walk into
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; as a token applied. The devil's not
[1:51:15] welcome. His music is not welcome. His
[1:51:18] nonsense is not welcome. We're just not
[1:51:21] lucky.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; We applied a blood a long time ago. This
[1:51:26] message works.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. You can't fool
[1:51:34] children.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Little children see.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; They hear.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; They copy.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; They know what's right. Right
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; now I'm speaking to the youth are all
[1:51:49] across this building. You know,
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; but sometimes you as little children
[1:51:55] have got to break the cycle.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you as little children's got
[1:52:02] to break the cycle. If your mom and dad
[1:52:03] won't break the cycle, you break the
[1:52:05] cycle.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to live with that.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; This one backslide, that one backslide.
[1:52:13] Somebody's going to overcome.
[1:52:15] Somebody's going to be a real believer.
[1:52:17] I believe I'm one of them.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; I stood with you in the
[1:52:32] in a meeting in China.
[1:52:36] I don't speak your language.
[1:52:40] Wish I did. I love your people.
[1:52:45] Go back in a moment.
[1:52:48] And I say that from my heart.
[1:52:51] Go back in a moment.
[1:52:55] You stood beside me in the prayer line
[1:52:59] and you you knew those people
[1:53:02] and God told them things I didn't know,
[1:53:05] but God told them things
[1:53:09] for hours. Six hours one night.
[1:53:13] God told you things
[1:53:17] that you knew. I didn't know, but he
[1:53:20] knowed.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; I looked into your eyes and you were
[1:53:28] told things you knew I didn't know, but
[1:53:31] he knew.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Why would he do that to you? He
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; cares.
[1:53:41] Amen.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; He cares.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; He cares. Why would people drive all
[1:53:52] across America
[1:53:55] to get to a prophet of God and maybe not
[1:53:57] get a prayer card?
[1:54:01] I grew up with a man that preached the
[1:54:04] message and he called it shotgun
[1:54:06] preaching. His name was Charlie
[1:54:07] Mitchell. And he walked into that
[1:54:10] meeting with a tumor on his left lung.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; And he didn't get a prayer card.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; He didn't get he had no no chance of
[1:54:19] being able to walk across the stage.
[1:54:22] Huge meeting.
[1:54:24] Charlie was sitting there with a death
[1:54:26] sentence.
[1:54:28] And the other ministers had called out
[1:54:30] to him and said, "If you we can get you
[1:54:31] to the prophet,
[1:54:33] you'll be well." And they were sitting
[1:54:36] aside from him because I didn't get to
[1:54:37] sit with him. And brother Brandham calls
[1:54:40] out, I believe, Reverend Mr. Smith. And
[1:54:42] then he calls Charlie Mitchell. I knew
[1:54:44] that man.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Charlie Mitchell was sitting there with
[1:54:49] a tumor on his left lung. I heard him
[1:54:52] say it over and over again.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; It was like an eye looking back at him.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; And he said, I ducked down for a minute.
[1:54:59] There it was. And he said, and he called
[1:55:01] my name and told me where I came from,
[1:55:04] told me my condition. The difference was
[1:55:07] he went home.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; The difference is is a lot of people can
[1:55:13] call you out and a lot of people can do
[1:55:15] a lot of different kind of things. But
[1:55:16] the difference is when you go home.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; I grew up watching Charlie Mitchell
[1:55:31] preach a shotgun sort of message and he
[1:55:34] called it starting out here and end up
[1:55:36] somewhere. He said, "I'm going to shoot
[1:55:38] all over the tree to get to you."
[1:55:43] I watched I watched people come out of
[1:55:46] wheelchairs with his faith.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; I watched I watched him preach the word
[1:55:52] of God.
[1:55:55] My father was an associate pastor in the
[1:55:58] church and later to become a pastor. I
[1:56:01] grew up with this kind of a faith.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; I grew up with this kind of faith.
[1:56:07] I grew up walking into a into a into a
[1:56:10] woman that was now 85 lbs and she had
[1:56:12] been about a 250 lb woman and she had a
[1:56:15] tumor on her throat and dad walked in
[1:56:18] and said, "I want you to go in and smell
[1:56:20] it." He said, "That's a smell of death.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; That's a smell of leprosy." Walked in
[1:56:25] there and he told her, he said, "Sister
[1:56:28] Barer, you'll live and not die." Laid
[1:56:31] his hand on that tumor and cursed it in
[1:56:33] the name of Jesus Christ. I'll tell you
[1:56:36] what, every weekend she would come back
[1:56:38] saying, "Charlie, I've gained five more
[1:56:40] pounds."
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; And she was thrilled. She wasn't on no
[1:56:44] Weight Watcher program. She was thrilled
[1:56:47] when she went over 200 lb again. To God
[1:56:50] be the glory.
[1:56:52] [applause and cheering]
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; God's not interested in a Hollywood
[1:56:57] body.
[1:57:00] [laughter]
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; So many times we want to fool with the
[1:57:13] recipe,
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; right? True.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that recipe
[1:57:20] is you can kind of work it a little bit
[1:57:22] is if you can get yourself to come every
[1:57:25] weekend, every couple weeks, just come
[1:57:28] to church. It'll soothe that feeling.
[1:57:33] It'll soo the feeling to where that you
[1:57:36] can go to church and then you can sin.
[1:57:39] You can go to church and you can sin.
[1:57:41] Before long, you've hushed the
[1:57:43] conscience.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; But let me just say,
[1:57:49] you know,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; there comes a point
[1:57:55] to where that you have to come to a
[1:57:56] point
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; that you can't live that way no more.
[1:58:10] It's kind of like
[1:58:14] one time I was in a vision
[1:58:17] and I was walking off of this crater. It
[1:58:19] looked like a bomb had taken place to
[1:58:21] where this earth had been so destroyed
[1:58:24] and roads were destroyed and buildings
[1:58:27] were destroyed. And when I got to the
[1:58:29] bottom of a crater,
[1:58:33] everything was black and there was a
[1:58:35] girl standing there.
[1:58:39] Sister Connie was with me. And we walked
[1:58:42] down into that crater and I said, "Are
[1:58:45] you ready to leave now?
[1:58:48] Cuz things can't get no worse. Are you
[1:58:50] ready to leave?"
[1:58:53] And she said, "I'm ready."
[1:58:57] and we walk back up out of that crater.
[1:59:02] You see, nobody can make you do
[1:59:04] anything. You have to come to a spot to
[1:59:07] where
[1:59:09] I can live differently.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; You preached long enough to know that
[1:59:21] I'm dealing with quite a few things
[1:59:22] here.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; The servant told him, said,
[1:59:33] "Go wash."
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Go wash.
[1:59:45] He made his way to the altar. He made
[1:59:48] his way to the Jordan.
[1:59:51] Brother Brandham said he was like a cat
[1:59:54] and sticky molasses.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; So he was down there putting his feet in
[2:00:02] it, kind of stomping in it. Muddy. It
[2:00:06] was nasty. It's where the waters come
[2:00:08] together. And it's a nasty place.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; He's not going to just put his feet in
[2:00:15] it. He's got to get in it.
[2:00:18] Amen.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Now, folks, he walked in here full of
[2:00:23] leprosy.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; And he walked down and he put his feet
[2:00:28] in that sticky water and mud.
[2:00:32] He put himself down in there.
[2:00:35] I don't know how deep. I don't I don't
[2:00:37] have that. But he got out to where he
[2:00:40] was standing in it and all he could see
[2:00:43] was mud. That's what represented his
[2:00:46] sin.
[2:00:49] He was and the prophet told him to dip
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; and he dipped
[2:00:57] and he came up and he looked and it was
[2:00:59] still the same way.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Have you tried before and you came up
[2:01:04] and it was still the same weight?
[2:01:08] You tried before and you came up and
[2:01:10] you're still the same way.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; He dipped.
[2:01:16] He came up.
[2:01:22] He dipped.
[2:01:24] And he came up.
[2:01:27] Maybe there was a spot or two that he
[2:01:28] felt like quitting.
[2:01:38] He did. He came up.
[2:01:43] He's a general. Everybody knows he's
[2:01:45] dipping.
[2:01:50] He dips. He comes up.
[2:01:55] The sixth time he dips, he looks down
[2:01:58] and he knows, "I'm just doing what the
[2:02:01] prophet tells me to do.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; I'm doing what that little girl told me
[2:02:05] to do."
[2:02:09] Brother Jonathan when he dipped this
[2:02:11] time,
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; the vision of the prophet and the vision
[2:02:15] of that little girl.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; And the prescription and everything that
[2:02:20] had bound him in slavery, what he had
[2:02:22] lived in in secrecy,
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; the thing that he had tried to hide all
[2:02:29] [screaming] this time,
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; he was free.
[2:02:34] [cheering]
[2:02:35] [applause]
[2:02:37] He was free.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; It would never hold him bondage again.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Smell of his flesh, it didn't stink no
[2:02:46] more. It wasn't oozing no more.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; He wasn't a slave no more.
[2:02:53] [cheering]
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to just notice what were
[2:03:00] you going to do after the miracle?
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:04] It's one thing to have a miracle. It's
[2:03:06] one thing to have a transformation. But
[2:03:07] what are you going to do after today?
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do this coming
[2:03:12] year?
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you I've been I've been
[2:03:15] wrestling this sermon as I'm going
[2:03:17] along. I haven't just been giving you a
[2:03:19] normal sermon. This is a year sermon for
[2:03:22] you. What are you going to do after the
[2:03:24] miracle?
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:32] He goes back to the prophet to give
[2:03:34] thanks and offer him all of his
[2:03:36] treasures. Listen, you're willing to
[2:03:37] give it all.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; You're willing to give whatever. He's
[2:03:40] brought incredible treasures to pro. He
[2:03:42] wasn't interested in that.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "At least let me take a a beast
[2:03:46] home with with with with buckets of
[2:03:50] dirt.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Let me take dirt home.
[2:04:00] Brother Ron, what's the significance of
[2:04:02] him wanting to take dirt home? He wanted
[2:04:05] to be where that prophet had been.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; What God blessed that ground, that
[2:04:10] hollowed ground. I want to take some of
[2:04:12] this home with me.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; I want to take what's living in this
[2:04:16] church to my house.
[2:04:19] I want that same God to live on the
[2:04:22] inside of me. The same God that was in
[2:04:24] the prophet. The same God that's in my
[2:04:26] pastor. The same God in the one. I want
[2:04:29] [screaming] that same God.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Preacher.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Don't soft soap yourself.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Don't halfway.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Don't live for decades behind a mask.
[2:04:57] Do you know who I am?
[2:05:00] Non. Yes, I do.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; But you need to wash.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; You need to wash.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Are you getting it?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Cloverdale. God decided the first thing
[2:05:18] the first Sunday of the new year was to
[2:05:20] to give you a bath.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter]
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; I may never get to preach again,
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; but today
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; God sent some bath water for you.
[2:05:39] [applause]
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; He said,
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; "Clean your fingers."
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Yep. Clean behind your ears.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Clean the back of your head. Wash. I
[2:05:49] want to smell the I want to smell the
[2:05:51] soap.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; It's what you told your children. Did
[2:05:57] you take a bath?
[2:06:00] You didn't take a bath.
[2:06:04] How many moms could say that across this
[2:06:06] building? Every mom just said, "Yes,
[2:06:08] that's right. I've told my children, "Go
[2:06:10] take a bath."
[2:06:12] Did you brush your teeth, honey?
[2:06:16] Let me check.
[2:06:19] I watch my daughter-in-laws smell hands
[2:06:23] and I laugh cuz a few years ago I was
[2:06:25] smelling their father's hands.
[2:06:28] [laughter]
[2:06:32] And I'm sorry, so many times there still
[2:06:35] stinkers
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; and you can wrap all kinds of things on
[2:06:43] it
[2:06:46] and you can put all kinds of clothes on
[2:06:48] it.
[2:06:56] But when you go home, you got to take it
[2:06:59] off.
[2:07:02] And when you look at the man in the
[2:07:03] mirror,
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; you know,
[2:07:08] you know,
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; you know
[2:07:19] why do we discredit prayer prayer lines
[2:07:21] or altar calls?
[2:07:26] Brother Brandham did it.
[2:07:29] I'll tell you why we do that.
[2:07:32] It's because we want to make it easy.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; We want to make it easy. Just evolve
[2:07:39] your way into the message.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Just make it easy. You got to die.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I can't die for you.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; I was a homeless drug addict at one time
[2:07:52] and I had to die. Sister Tracy, you
[2:07:55] remember sitting in a service? I've
[2:07:56] heard your testimony so many times
[2:07:58] sitting in the service and God just
[2:08:00] began to sweep over your life. Many
[2:08:03] years ago, I brought my son that'll be
[2:08:05] here
[2:08:07] one day.
[2:08:13] I brought him to this meeting and I knew
[2:08:15] he was a stinker.
[2:08:18] He was my boy, but he was a stinker. He
[2:08:22] was dressing the part and combing the
[2:08:24] part and he was doing the part and he
[2:08:26] was at every service. But he was a
[2:08:27] stinker. Come on, brother Joel. You
[2:08:30] ought to be the best a man in this
[2:08:31] building.
[2:08:34] And you had a meeting that day.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; And later that night, he would have a
[2:08:38] meeting and you two would never be the
[2:08:40] same.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Ben, you had a meeting in Edmonton and
[2:08:44] you would never be the same.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take 10 years. It just takes
[2:08:51] a few moments.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Just a few moments. Jump, shout. I don't
[2:08:57] I don't care what you do there. That's
[2:08:58] not emotion comes with it. But let me
[2:09:00] just say, let that eternal moment
[2:09:03] happen. [screaming]
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; That gene seed of God has got to come to
[2:09:09] life in the right atmosphere.
[2:09:20] Oh, holy God.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Holy God.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben, you said, "I'll never come
[2:09:27] back to church no more." And that's what
[2:09:29] you told your father. I'm done. I'm done
[2:09:31] with that. I'm done with that. And he
[2:09:32] said, "Brother Ron's speaking, isn't it
[2:09:33] right? It's what you told me in
[2:09:34] Edmonton." And he said, "I I'm done with
[2:09:36] that. I'm done with that."
[2:09:40] And you came that night and you were
[2:09:41] sitting the side of a pole
[2:09:46] and the Lord spoke to me three months
[2:09:48] before you'll preach this at Harold
[2:09:49] Hilderbrance on a Wednesday night.
[2:09:54] And I thought, I preach his convention.
[2:09:56] I'll never be there on a Wednesday
[2:09:57] night.
[2:09:59] And Tim Dodd calls me. Brother Tim Dodd
[2:10:02] calls me says, "I want you to come and
[2:10:04] preach a meeting."
[2:10:06] And brother Harold calls just before and
[2:10:09] he says, "You're going to brother Tims."
[2:10:11] He said, "Stop in Edmonton to speak on
[2:10:13] Wednesday night." And I had the service.
[2:10:16] While I was studying three months
[2:10:18] before, God told me, "This is the
[2:10:20] service that you'll preach." He knew
[2:10:22] you'd be coming to the muddy Jordan
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; and you were an intricral part of that,
[2:10:30] not knowing that eternal seed had to
[2:10:33] come to life. and you invited me to that
[2:10:35] meeting. I slept in your basement. We
[2:10:38] had a wonderful time. Your boys played
[2:10:39] Nerf guns and we had a wonderful time at
[2:10:42] your home.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; But on the way, I would I would preach
[2:10:48] and it seemed like that nothing was
[2:10:50] happening, but God had came to you in
[2:10:53] that meeting.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Did that end the wars of agony of
[2:11:00] wrestling with your humanity? I'd say
[2:11:02] absolutely not. There's probably been
[2:11:04] many spots in your life that if you
[2:11:06] could get equipped,
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; circumstances come and situations come
[2:11:11] and stories come and all kind of history
[2:11:14] comes and everything comes together. But
[2:11:16] you know,
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; sir, sir,
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; but you know,
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; but you [screaming] know that you know
[2:11:24] that you know that you know it's not you
[2:11:27] holding on. It's him holding on to you.
[2:11:31] Amen.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; That's greater than being healed of
[2:11:44] cancer. That's greater than walking
[2:11:47] being able to walk that eternal
[2:11:49] [screaming] part of you.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; That eternal part.
[2:12:01] You know what that's like, Sam?
[2:12:04] We stood at the lake at Mount Baker a
[2:12:06] couple years ago. You know what that's
[2:12:08] like?
[2:12:11] All of a sudden, you're in a moment.
[2:12:16] I know I've been a little lengthy, but
[2:12:18] I'm coming to an end now.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; But I want to I want to just capture
[2:12:23] just for a moment. You're in a moment.
[2:12:31] It's that moment that changes your life
[2:12:36] forever.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I've ever prayed for a
[2:12:43] service like I've prayed for this one.
[2:12:47] And I'm saying that in my own humanity
[2:12:50] because I know
[2:12:53] I know
[2:12:59] some of you are thinking this is so
[2:13:00] elementary.
[2:13:02] Three different people in this building
[2:13:04] has wrote me that this service is
[2:13:06] between life and death.
[2:13:10] So, do you think I walked into this
[2:13:11] building thinking, "Well, we're just
[2:13:13] going to have another good service and
[2:13:15] go to go to a restaurant,
[2:13:19] go rest this afternoon, and get ready
[2:13:21] for the service." Oh, no. This is
[2:13:23] between life and death.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; I'd like for you to bow your heads now.
[2:13:54] Now's your opportunity. I've did my job.

[2:14:18] washed.
[2:14:22] Would there be a hand up in the
[2:14:23] building, Brother Ron? I've lived a
[2:14:24] double life and I need to raise my hand
[2:14:26] before God.

[2:23:48] I have never been disappointed in you.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; So, Father, I ask you to forgive us of

[2:40:10] Christ.
[2:40:12] Hallelu.
[2:40:15] I believe we can lift up our voice
[2:40:17] [music]
[2:40:18] in thanksgiving.
[2:40:21] How often we heard just go your way,
[2:40:24] rejoice. Just go your way, rejoice.
[2:40:27] Jesus is near.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Just come by your way and change your
[2:40:33] heart. Change your lives.
[2:40:36] To God be the glory.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; To God be the glory. Great things
[2:40:43] [snorts] is [music] done.
[2:40:46] Jesus, in all humility, Lord,
[2:40:50] you know our hearts. Oh God,
[2:40:53] all we've been desiring is the moving
[2:40:57] of the Holy Ghost
[2:41:00] within this little assembly. Lord,
[2:41:04] it's been the cry of our hearts, Lord.
[2:41:09] [music]
[2:41:10] Ones respond this way,
[2:41:13] some respond this way.
[2:41:16] But Lord, at least we're responding.
[2:41:18] Lord, [music]
[2:41:21] I give you praise
[2:41:24] and thanksgiving for the faithfulness
[2:41:27] of the dealing of the Holy Ghost.
[2:41:34] Just
[2:41:35] in a moment, [music] you can change our
[2:41:38] lives. And you indeed have.
[2:41:43] And so Lord, with [music] my heart and
[2:41:46] mouth lifted up, I give you praise,
[2:41:49] Lord. Thank you for a wonderful people
[2:41:52] that can respond.
[2:41:55] Nathan, Lord, came. He said, "Well, I
[2:41:57] thought I thought he had his own
[2:41:59] thoughts, but when he cast them down and
[2:42:02] caught your thought,
[2:42:05] Lord, it was all well.
[2:42:08] Make it all well, Lord, from the front
[2:42:11] of this altar, Lord, to the back of the
[2:42:14] church. Make it all well now, Lord.
[2:42:18] That we can make this declaration, as
[2:42:21] our brother Spadford once said, it is
[2:42:23] well
[2:42:25] with my soul.
[2:42:29] We ask that you would be with your
[2:42:31] people this afternoon and that [music]
[2:42:33] we give you praise, Lord, in our private
[2:42:36] conversations. Jesus met me. Jesus
[2:42:39] healed me. Jesus delivered me. I'm not
[2:42:42] two persons no more. I don't have a
[2:42:44] split personality. I've got one heart,
[2:42:47] one goal, one vision, one God, and he's
[2:42:51] a lovely Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:42:56] Father, would you now go with us? We
[2:42:59] will [music] return back, but we'll
[2:43:01] return back different. Lord,
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; we will return back a different people.
[2:43:07] We are facing this new year, Lord. You
[2:43:10] have set these meetings in order.
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; And now, God, push us forward. Let that
[2:43:17] drive within us move us where you want
[2:43:20] us to be.
[2:43:23] We ask now your blessing on your
[2:43:25] children
[2:43:27] and dismiss them in the name of the Lord
[2:43:29] Jesus
[2:43:31] for your glory and for your honor.
[2:43:36] It is well with my soul.
[2:43:47] [music]
[2:43:54] With [music] sorrows
[2:43:57] I see
