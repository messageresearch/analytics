Brother John, would you mind opening [music] the service this morning in a word of prayer? I believe there's victory in the camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's things we struggle with and there's things that [music] we fight with, but that's just because we have an adversary. Amen. But we believe the word of God is true. [music] We have overcome by the blood of the lamb, the word of our testimony. I bless you each one that's gathered [music] in this morning. We do want to remember a request for from sister Sonia in Croatia to pray for [music] a family in Hungary. This family is broken. Drug addicted children. Father and mother are believing. Amen. We'll believe with them this morning. The family is sealed. &gt;&gt; God is our healer of every [music] situation. Sister Tracy Rivas has written in a request to pray for Sister Kim Kak from Brother David Mciri's church in Texas. [music] She has very serious health needs and is currently in uh Washington DC seeking treatment. needs a move of God in a very supernatural way for healing while she is there. Amen. We w want to just pray that God will heal her and [music] open the doors that need opening at this time for her. We'll believe with you, Sister Tracy, [music] on her behalf this morning. If you have a need upon your heart, just desire that the mighty God will move [music] on your behalf this morning. We do want to remember brother Hugh message this morning. God will [music] lift him up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother John, God bless you. Our dear heavenly father, we want to lift up our hands and lift up our hearts. We approach you in quietness, Lord, realizing how great and awesome is your [music] presence. &gt;&gt; We want to thank you for the blood of Jesus Christ that covers each one of us. Your prophet has already spoken to us and said, "You hear our voices coming up through the blood." I pray that you would see your life today, the precious blood of Jesus that has invited us into your presence. How many prayer lines did your prophet have? And he said, "If there's sin in your life, step out of line and repent of that and step back in line to receive the healing, to receive the answer. Our dear heavenly father in communion service we are commanded to wait on one another we realize men and women today stand in your presence all of us claiming that streaming blood that cord for the token over our lives because without that and without this message there is no life. But because you've come to us in this generation, [music] we can throw open our arms, throw open our hearts and cry, "Aba, Father," and know that everything that we have need of, every need, every desire, every request is met within you. So Lord, you have placed gifts in the church. And Lord, we welcome you. the greatest gift ever, the Holy Ghost, to come and feel welcome today at Cloverdale Bible Way. This little address here on the hill, but more than that, souls and spirits and bodies of men and women cry out to you. We already sense your presence and the angels have taken their place. But there's something about redeemed men and women that can only sing about grace and mercy comes up to another level when men and women reach beyond the veil. Touch the hymn of almighty God. Lord Jesus, we love you today God and we want to welcome you first place. We want to crown you Lord of all and surrender everything and ask for forgiveness of every sin, every unbelief. As we approach you solemnly, we want to put everything under the blood of Jesus Christ. It's not our merits. It's not one another, it's you, Lord. And we claim that today and pray that you would cover this assembly, cover the sanctuary, this address, and out upon the internet. We pray that the Holy Ghost would anoint every individual, every predestinated seed to receive exactly what they have need of. Hands are lifted up. &gt;&gt; You're touched with the feeling of our infirmities. The high priest is here. The Holy Ghost is here. the one that seeks out every uh sheep like a great shepherd that knows all the details, all the fine print of every situation. We lay that out on the altar right now and ask you to consume it with your holy fire. Lord, take the service today and may Satan be defeated. May every unbelieving spirit and demon from hell be held captive at the name of Jesus. May the gift of the Holy Ghost work openly today amongst the congregation as we wait upon you and everything that's said and done today would be for the glory of God. Lord, we remember these couple requests, Lord, and hungry. We believe that you're more than able to deliver any spirit that would come in any family to divide a husband or a wife or children. Anything that comes in the household to break up oneness is not of God. So we claim the oneness of Jesus Christ. For every individual in this family in Hungary, we claim their loved ones under the token and we bind our hearts together across the oceans. not just for their family but for every family that the desperation cries would re unleash that power to bring souls to repentance. Even our dear sister from Dallas that's in Washington. Lord, you know the secrets of her heart and her needs and her personal life. Doctors and nurses and [music] they can all have their part. But the great healer, the great physician is you, Lord Jesus. And we release your power Lord God upon every need and every life. Nothing is hidden from your presence God. And we are here to adore you and worship you. And Lord Jesus give you first place. Take every song today, every prayer. May you sanction your will in every life. And may you just Lord be pleased with today. We give you this whole day and this service, this offering. May you multiply it to your service and for the glory of God. We give you ourselves, Lord, in worship. Take each life and fill us with your presence. And our brother Ron Spencer, may the Holy Ghost take the vessel, take the gift of God in his life, strengthen him, and may you give him eagle vision to say those things only that is thus sayeth the Lord. And may the Lord Jesus get behind the veil and say the things that we individually have need of for you to say. And we reverence you in Jesus Christ's name. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. As you have your seats [music] this morning, the deacons receive the offering. Certainly want to thank them for [music] that. Amen. God bless you, Brother Sam. Let's sing together. 11:03 I just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your word. Key of G as well. There's a uh white Jetta. License [music] plate DN7. I don't even know my license plate. If you have a white Jetta and it's out [music] in the parking lot and you drove it here today, go turn your lights off. Your battery will work and then you can go get some lunch. Amen. We're happy to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's nice to have each and every one of you here. Those that have connected with us on the internet say God bless you to you as well. Amen. Folks [music] stream from all over as you've heard on watch night. There were messages that came in that said they wanted to greet you and thank you for being at your post of duty so faithfully. [music] Amen. We would certainly appreciate the ministry. Let's sing this together. We'll turn the service to brother Ed here in just a moment. Invite him to come. [music] You didn't have to open [singing] my eyes. You could have easily passed [music] me by. [singing] Oh, the age I was living [music] in was fur. [singing] Then I heard recognizing [music] your name serge [singing] [music] [singing] and the mercy of grace. Lord, I thank you. Thank you [music] this morning. [singing] I just want to thank you Lord [music] for letting me hear [singing] your word. What have [music] I done to deserve such glory [singing] revealed in me? [music] [music and singing] &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; I thank you. I just want to thank you, Lord. I just want to [singing] thank you, Lord, for [music] you. I [singing] deserve such glory [music] for [music] when I saw your glorious [music] I. [music] Amen. God bless you each one. I am just going to take a few moments out of the service uh because we don't want to uh cramp or feel that the ministry is cramped &gt;&gt; for a time and uh I want to take a few moments and read a few scriptures. [clears throat] We're going to have an ordination service. But I wanted to say and I have been pondering this for several weeks, probably three, four weeks. [clears throat] To ordain is misunderstood, very much [clears throat] misunderstood. to appoint a person to preaching or other religious duties. However, there must be an author. If you look up the word in your dictionary or on your internet, you'll find it's someone that's being placed into an office, etc. But I was very much very much forced to go back and I had my wife reading all of these things and I said no no no no it's not it's way back of that and the scripture says quite a bit about it. So I was uh reading some scripture and I'm going to give you some of those scriptures just now. There must be an author and an author or a foundation to this sacred act &gt;&gt; because I read in the scripture where the Jews ordained it wasn't right. &gt;&gt; Uh and another one of the Old Testament saints ordained and people they were swept away with it. But he had a golden calf in Jerusalem and a golden calf in the far north so that the people for convenience sake. So everything that is just for convenience isn't necessarily of God. But when God does the ordaining and uh I'm going to read some scriptures for the gifts and calling and callings of God are without repentance. That scripture is used by the prophet of God very often. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. It's something that a person is born with and because of that you have a certain direction or a certain passion. But many times God works and this is in that message the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. He said, "But many times God's workmen come just in a a different way to get and then he breaks this qu the sentence but perceiving uh but perceiving their thoughts." That was new perceiving their thoughts. And you perhaps don't even know when that is happening, but God might even be answering or ministering to something during the service. And while the word is preached, &gt;&gt; your thoughts are being perceived. &gt;&gt; And then God at a at some moment will awaken you and say, "Hey, that's exactly what I was thinking about." Well, what you want to do? You want to go back and see what he was saying about what you were thinking about. And he said, uh, but perceiving their thoughts, and he will reveal it to babes such as will learn. &gt;&gt; It can't be your own way, but he'll reveal it to babes such as we'll learn. And you, he said, you believe that? &gt;&gt; And then he makes a statement which I want you to remember. God will do it. &gt;&gt; God is the one. He lays the foundation. And if he doesn't lay a foundation in the person's life, there's nothing you can do about it. And the Bible says in first kings 5, "And the king, which was King Solomon, commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and huge stones to the foundation of the house. &gt;&gt; It required those stones to be placed and fixed." And that's the first meaning really of ordination. Great stones, human stones, costly stones. It has nothing to do with the will of man. It has to do with the will of God. All the church world, all the organizations, they all have people they ordain. They just had a cardinal. I don't even mention this, but they just had a cardinal in Australia and he was sentenced to several years because he misused his office and abused some young men and he was a cardinal. He has appealed the case. This just happened. And he was sent to prison for six years. But I thought of how he uh you know I listened to the judge and they they were affected by his position. Man put him into that position. The pope even put him into that position. It doesn't matter uh if an archangel put you into a position if it's not according to the word of God. And I think of what the prophet of God said. He said he he said, "Did the angel of the Lord tell you to say that?" He said, "If the angel of the Lord told me something that wasn't in the word of God, I wouldn't believe him." &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; That's the kind of message you can have confidence in. It's here in the word of God. And the king commanded that they brought great stones, costly stones, huge stones to lay the foundation of the house. It was the house of the Lord. And the Bible says in 1 Peter 2 and5, you also as lively stones, not dead stones, but lively stones are built up a spiritual house. And that who that will be who brother Ron Spencer is preaching to this morning, a lively house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hill and stones. It didn't come maybe easy, but they're human stones, &gt;&gt; costly stones, and then they're made to fit. And that'll be a foundation. And he says, build up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. And then Philippians says, "Brethren, I count myself to have apprehended uh I count myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark of the high calling. I believe that's one of the things that Brother Spencer began the service with on Friday night. Uh I press I want to say to you believers, your lively stones, you've been cut, you've been human. You've been made more valuable. You don't even understand when that is happening. May be happening in your school. May be happening as a child, may be happening as a young man or a young woman. And the prophet of God made reference to it. And I want you to be conscious of it this morning. You are lively stones. The ministry that stands behind this pulpit is for your benefit. And it's for it's sent for your sake because God has you in his thoughts in his mind. And there may be something yet that he wishes to do. And we say, "Thy will be done." &gt;&gt; G &gt;&gt; on earth and in earth &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven. Thy will be done. And he says, "Brethren, I count I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things, I press toward the mark of the high calling. There's a goal. I press toward the mark. I pursue it. &gt;&gt; I re I receive the challenge that God has put in my heart &gt;&gt; and I am pursuing it with all that's in me &gt;&gt; that I may attain that goal &gt;&gt; for the prize of the high calling. When you were called to this message, my friends, I I feel as though I'm up here. I have looked at these scriptures. I have pondered them. I have gone back and forth over them for several weeks. I press toward the mark. And the reason why you press is God the author in his predestinated plan. He put something in you that would cause you to keep pressing forward for the toward the mark, toward the goal. Don't miss it. You won't miss it toward the prize for the prize of the high calling of God. It's his call &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. One who possesses the inner drive as a result of the call of God to seek after eagerly, earnestly endeavor to acquire. The call of God is very much misunderstood &gt;&gt; by most everyone including some who have been ordained. &gt;&gt; It's not a it's not a solve all. It isn't a fix all. It is that the even the man of God who stands to offer prayer for the ordaining of God's call called servant. You can't invent that. The call of God is very much misunderstood by most everyone including some that have been ordained to press. And this I want to go into just a wee bit, just a couple moments to press. What is that? What what what causes you to get up and say, "I'll continue on." &gt;&gt; What causes that? What is it in you that says, "I just can't I can't give it up. I can't throw the towel in. Brother Gunther, he's passed away just now recently. I phoned him once on a during the week and I said, "Brother Gunther, do you ever feel like giving up the ministry?" He said, "About once every Sunday." [laughter] I said, "Well, thanks for being truthful." said about once every Sunday, but he he would be there at the pulpit the next Sunday and the next one. Why? Because something was in inside driving him forward. He was eagerly eagerly looking forward to the prize of the high calling. He's gone to his reward. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not just someone that ministers and it's not someone who just preaches. It is something that is inside that is driving a person. Now I'm going to take you just on a quick curve. Samuel was sent with a horn horn of oil. to anoint a person and he said you go to the house of Jesse. So he went to h the house of Jesse and he had quite a few children. So he said [clears throat] Samuel said are here all thy children because each one that came know it's what was pressing him was saying inside it's not him. &gt;&gt; It's not him. &gt;&gt; It's not him. Fine young men, fine children. And and he said there remainth yet the youngest. And you know when I was pondering when the Holy Spirit was bringing this to me was in the wee hours of the morning. There's still one. The youngest is not here. And behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, "Send and fetch him." They didn't send a Rolls-Royce. They didn't send an armored vehicle. They were bringing a man that was going to sing the psalms of the word of God. &gt;&gt; And he said he's out there with the sheep yet. And he said, "Go and fetch him, for we will not sit down till he come hither." Yeah. And he sent and brought him in. [clears throat] Now he who he was ready and with all of a beautiful complexion, countenance, and goodly to look at. That had nothing to do with it. And the Lord said, And the Lord said, "Arise, anoint him." This is him. That's the kind of laying down of a stone. &gt;&gt; That's essential. That's the foundation stone. That's not calling someone forward in all of their robes and and cute little hats and things. It has nothing to do with that. You can ordain a man can ordain men till they're blue in the face, but if it's not in here &gt;&gt; by a predestinated stone. &gt;&gt; That's right. And that person may well have attempted other things. You may even be blessed of God in other things. You may be blessed of God with skills that God will never use. You may be blessed of God of intelligence that God may or may not use. He may use it for a time to get you to a certain point and then turn a sharp corner. Believe me, I I speak as one of experience. He may bring you and drive you. I have a passion have had a passion for uh 40 plus these 20 years, 60 years. I've had a passion. You have to forgive me for a moment, but that passion has been I've enjoyed this message. &gt;&gt; This is a man running from the presence of the Lord. But the message is the third Exodus. &gt;&gt; Kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; I said, I have been so blessed. The mighty God unveiled. I've been so blessed &gt;&gt; and I've looked into the eyes of Africans and Indian brethren and sisters, been in their homes, slept in their beds. I did hear amongst the native Indian people, which they call indigenous first nations and all that lot. When they're amongst themselves, I hear what they call themselves. And I stayed in their rooms. And here in Cloverdale, we went to Uklit and I stayed on the native side with the Indian people because I had never stayed anywhere else. I had never stayed in a white motel. I stayed with them, ate their food, worshiped with them, prayed with them, and I became their friend indeed. And they are I can't describe. I tell you what, one native young man walked in here and kind of came to the forward and some deacons came forward. They didn't know whether he I was going to be attacked because we met right here and threw our arms around each other. He had I didn't pay the attention that he had long hair. I knew him when he was crippled in the hip from a shot from a gun. I I knew his background, etc., etc., but I loved him with an undying love. had a passion, brother Tim, to get this message into other languages. &gt;&gt; And I could not shake it. &gt;&gt; I apologized to the congregation here, but I want you to know I'm receiving letters almost every week. They're so thankful for the word that goes from this church, Brother Tom, and the ministry of the word that's ministered here and for our stand with the word. If you have ever grumbled over our stand with the word, you'll have to get somebody else to hear it because I can tell you that it will have no effect upon us because we're fighting a losing battle with something that's inside. It's called the seed of God. &gt;&gt; It's called the Holy Ghost. And we cannot we cannot uh change that. &gt;&gt; This morning this morning you're here at church. I was looking for Sister Annel from &gt;&gt; Africa. &gt;&gt; Zimbabwe. &gt;&gt; She's in &gt;&gt; pardon. &gt;&gt; She's in Africa. &gt;&gt; She's left. &gt;&gt; She's in Africa. Well, I don't know. They feel that the whole nation is in starvation mode and they only have food to carry even the higherups. They'll only carry the nation till the end of February. They're without food. I'm so glad that in the 1980s I walked all over the place. I talked to people, found a place where they could print the message. They got to have maybe they haven't got race, but they've got to have this. &gt;&gt; They've got to have this word revealed to them. They have to have that. And then God, the God who wrote this, &gt;&gt; will provide for them &gt;&gt; because he promised to do that. &gt;&gt; If you'll pray for them. And I have one scripture and I'm going to call Michael if you'd like to come down. You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. The scripture says, "And ordained you," and I'm referring to each one, [clears throat] that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain, and whatsoever you shall ask in ask of the father in my name, he will do it. &gt;&gt; Thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Shall we rise to our feet, please? you that are standing here in a couple moments maybe you're feeling I'm taking too [clears throat] much time but in a couple moments our brother Ron Spencer will speak to those that God has spoken to in this word and he said, "Also, I will ordain a place for my people Israel and will plant them, and they shall dwell there in peace, and dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more, neither Neither shall the children of the wickedness waste them anymore as at the beginning. &gt;&gt; The children of wickedness shall not move the people of God. &gt;&gt; They will not have an effect upon you. &gt;&gt; That's thus saith the word of God. &gt;&gt; I will do it. &gt;&gt; He will lay the foundation. He will do the necessary essential work. And this is not just some uh of my thoughts. This is his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And with this I do you know why you're here? There's parts of this Bible that are waiting to be fulfilled. You know, when Samuel was saying, and this is what I was laying on the on my bed thinking, when Samuel was saying, he still had the oil in his hand. The oil to anoint someone. He said, "Do you have all your children here?" He was hearing something. Maybe he was hearing the singing of the Psalms, &gt;&gt; the glory &gt;&gt; and the worship to God that came out of David's mouth. He had to do that. That had to happen. David is in Kings. David is in Chronicles. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 just couldn't come &gt;&gt; by itself. &gt;&gt; Where's your part? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And after you eat and partake and that's what I was so I felt a commission of this entire congregation. Maybe you don't understand. you young men. I didn't have a profession. I didn't have much of an education. I didn't have a chance at it. I was poorly educated. I never finished high school. I understand my mother had grade two and died when she when I was six and a half. I never had access to dentists and to doctors and to people that every home needs. I didn't have access to it. I wandered from one camp to another, from one place to another. I'm not calling for your sympathy. God knew exactly where I was at. &gt;&gt; And I was learning exactly what I needed to learn. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Sister Abigail, you're a a woman of the north, and God gave you exactly the upbringing &gt;&gt; that you need to be the wife of Michael. And when you're ironing that shirt, there will be many more like that. You're listening very close. My eldest daughter, Linda, is here. You'll allow me to be a little emotional at a moment, but many times when you are gathered with your families, I was not able to gather with my family and my daughter, our first to be born, was laying in a hospital here and had just had surgery. And she was under the under the uh &gt;&gt; anesthetic. &gt;&gt; Anesthetic. Yeah, she was under anesthetic just coming out and we were rushing to the airport and my wife, God bless her, for a mother that bore that child. and she just coming out of the anesthetic and she said, "Look, no tubes." They had just pulled the tubes out and we said goodbye and went to the airport. I just met a sister this morning from South Africa. God bless you. I was in one of the ministers homes when a phone call came and somebody had traced me down and I went to the phone. They said, "Your stepmother had just passed away and her funeral will be on Friday or whatever day." And I said, "I just can't make it. I can't get back from South Africa to America in time. So, I was not here for my stepmom's funeral. Friends, those things do mean something. But when you've gone down the road a few years and you say, "Well, was it worth it?" Yeah, it was worth it. &gt;&gt; It was worth it. I thank God for his call on your life and that's why you're here. There are times maybe you would like to have thrown in the towel and quit. But there's something within you. It's called the Holy Ghost. It's not your human spirit. Your human spirit. You would have gone a different direction, Michael. Yeah. There's people you would have operated on as a doctor and you would have alleviated a lot of their trouble and pain perhaps. And there's others here, Sister Anna Hope, Sister Lisa, and there's others of you that could do a lot. And the prophet of God comes. Do you know what he says? He says they have hospitals and that's good. And some of the prophet's best friends were even Dr. Samadair. That's good. That's not That's not the highest calling. There's something still higher. And maybe you feel that even as brother Spencer is going to come and preach the higher calling. I wonder brother Michael if you'll come down and perhaps sister Abigail you'll come down with him because and we'll go down and pray, shall we? It's about ordination. And now we ask oh God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That you'll receive this couple &gt;&gt; for their &gt;&gt; work. &gt;&gt; That you have &gt;&gt; for them. For Sister Abigail, &gt;&gt; brother Michael. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You put it in their heart. I want to help &gt;&gt; Jesus. And I want to help my dad. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In the ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and and a great fear came upon his life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I never wondered. I never wanted this." &gt;&gt; But he will not run from it &gt;&gt; because the call is too great &gt;&gt; and they're without repentance. &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Ron Spencer, will you pray for them? &gt;&gt; Michael, &gt;&gt; I stood on a very supernatural night. This is a very spirit supernatural day &gt;&gt; and he's got great work to do. He has arranged this whole thing. Almighty God, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Th will be done. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, just now As I stood in a prayer line with Michael &gt;&gt; and your uncction came, &gt;&gt; I feel like Samuel and him &gt;&gt; pouring all on David. &gt;&gt; Here we are three years later &gt;&gt; in this moment of time &gt;&gt; that blends with eternity. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. It's not what a man lays his hands on. It's what God lays his hands on. &gt;&gt; We're not interested in man's opinion. &gt;&gt; We're not even interested in a man's thoughts. &gt;&gt; But God, we give oursel to you just now. &gt;&gt; By the authority of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; we recognize the gift that you placed in his life for the world. We recognize not just he but his wife. &gt;&gt; Oh, we stand on these sacred grounds right now. &gt;&gt; Oh God, holy is the presence. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may the angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; even sanctioned this day in this moment. Father, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you see the hardships, the difficulties, &gt;&gt; the literally endless hours of study, &gt;&gt; the prayer &gt;&gt; of great decisions, of circumstances, standing there, &gt;&gt; oh God, &gt;&gt; anointed for the purpose, &gt;&gt; oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh God, and we as an audience recognize the the full circle &gt;&gt; of events now. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; and we stand with mighty men &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Holy name. &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask you now, &gt;&gt; all conquering men &gt;&gt; that you would take Michael. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; yes my &gt;&gt; use him for your service. &gt;&gt; Not even for his service. &gt;&gt; This is not his gift. That's your gift. &gt;&gt; Yes. not his gift to abuse and use, &gt;&gt; but it's your gift &gt;&gt; to bless the body of Jesus Christ and edify. &gt;&gt; And Lord, may even the people that sat under to hear the word of God, may they realize that's coming from the very throne of God. Oh God, &gt;&gt; oh God, we just pray now. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; we thank you for these things. Thank you for this moment, Father. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing your song. This message makes music. &gt;&gt; You're the one that's going to make the music. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The same as David. He had all that in him. &gt;&gt; It had to be in here. &gt;&gt; And the message is in here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the revelation is in you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's different. Sing your song. [music] &gt;&gt; Somebody's waiting to hear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. God bless you. I [music] stand [singing] in all within [music] the wisdom [singing] of [music] the agees. Whom [music and singing] the raging of the sea subside, the living [singing] [music] sacrifice, the only source [music] of [singing] life. My is [music] in [singing] you. from this time on [music] [singing] my [music] Lord forever [music] more. [singing] His tender mercies, [music] His tender mercies [singing] come with every rising sun to [music] meet the senior [singing] [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] Oh, [music] [singing] heat, [music] heat. [singing] [music] forever. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; What a great [music] day. Hallelujah. Brother Michael, it seems like we've made a full circle. And God bless you. Thank you, thank you for letting me be a part of that. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We love you with all of our hearts and so good to see you this morning. And I'm just thankful that we we're just here. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've had a wonderful, wonderful time already. And today is a going to be a great day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I awoke this morning and I told Sister Connie, I said, "Today's a really great day for a believer and a really bad day for the devil." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Without a whole lot of ado, I won't spend I won't I won't take long this morning and maybe we'll finish this evening. But I'm conscious of time, but I'm also conscious that I'm sent here to do a job, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, [clears throat] you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I I just want to say something to you today. I'm not here for a notch on the belt. I'm not here to get clicks on an internet. And I'm not here for popularity. I'm here on a mission. &gt;&gt; And I want to come to your home. Many times I I say this, I'd like to come to your porch and drink coffee with you and eat some chocolates, but today I believe God's going to allow me to do that in another realm. And I'd like for you to be very conscious, if you if I can ask you to do that, be very conscious that I'm getting ready to come to your house. Not me personally, &gt;&gt; but him &gt;&gt; and he wants to speak to you. We are identified one time when Jesus was walking through a street and there was a lot of things going on around. Healings and miracles and faith was arising and people's expectations were in a lot of ways. And Jesus walks under a tree and there's a man there. Brother Brandham describes that man quite well and very vividly. And he called him by name and he said, "Zakius, &gt;&gt; come down. I'm going to go home with you and eat with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. to the neighborhood. They probably thought Jesus just picked the worst man &gt;&gt; that he could have picked &gt;&gt; and some call him a prophet and forgot the miracles that just happened. &gt;&gt; And Jesus goes to Zakius's house because he's a predestinated seat. &gt;&gt; And he goes to his house and he has lunch with him and they say a lot of things and he has lunch with him and Jesus's presence changed his life &gt;&gt; just his presence changed his life &gt;&gt; in the coming days he would restore and he would become a different kind of a man &gt;&gt; and his whole life would change &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why Jesus came to his house. &gt;&gt; I'd like to invite you to prayer now. And I want you personally, don't invite him to somebody else's house. I want you to personally invite him to your house. I want to invite him to your pew just now. &gt;&gt; Could you do that with me by a raise of hands all across this audience? Amen. Amen. Almighty God, we bow our heads before you now. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for these events already this morning. &gt;&gt; It's a culmination of of many things. And we have saw your supernatural hand. It's not passed on by natural lineage. And no doubt in many times circles people say, "Well, that's just the family. That's just the family moving on." But God, you you're the caller. &gt;&gt; You're the ordainer. And just as much as Michael has stood here before with Abigail and no doubt neither wanted to be in this position a few years ago, but today here they stand. &gt;&gt; God, you have gathered us from all realms of the earth. &gt;&gt; And years ago, we would have probably no doubt picked this way, but you picked it, Father. &gt;&gt; You called and you placed it. Decisions were made, choices were made, and and Lord, we can truly say this. You've been with us all our lives. &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, as I have studied and you have laid this on my heart now, knowing I was coming to this spot this morning, Lord, this morning, I pray that you would take these words. &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord, hide me behind a curtain if it may be. I don't want people to attach to my personality. I want them to attach to you &gt;&gt; and recognize that you are in this building, &gt;&gt; Lord. If I can say this in its correct way, the angel of God is here, &gt;&gt; Father. and may you search through our lives and minister to our hearts, &gt;&gt; Lord, for the purpose that we might be greater used, &gt;&gt; Lord, that we would lay aside every weight, &gt;&gt; every sin. &gt;&gt; Create a passion and a desire in us like never before. &gt;&gt; Lord, may we commit everything to you this morning. Father, forgive us of every mistake and every failure. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you take the tongs from off of the altar. Take that live coal and lay on our our lips now. Not just our lips, but our whole life. &gt;&gt; We wholly consecrate oursel to you now. Give oursel to you. May unbelief leave this building. I give you freedom to leave this building &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you. If you will turn with me in your scriptures this morning. [snorts] I would like to go to second Kings chapter 5 and verse one and then to Luke 4 and verse 23. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Kings chapter 5 and verse one. Thank you for the opportunity to stand before you. And I apologize that brother Tom's not speaking or brother Ed's not speaking or these other guys are not speaking, but you know, maybe maybe I can say something that'll bless your heart. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat and cough] &gt;&gt; Now non captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria. There's some incredible words said there. He has been used to fulfill the vision of the word of God. &gt;&gt; He is honorable. He's a great man. Now, God saying this about him, right? &gt;&gt; And it's going to be written down in eternal word. &gt;&gt; This is what the caliber of a man that he was. &gt;&gt; He was also a mighty man in valor. But notice these next words. But he was a leper. &gt;&gt; In Luke 4 verse 23, Jesus will recall this from the word. And Jesus is speaking. And he said unto them, you will surely say unto me this proverb, physician, heal thyself. whatsoever you have heard done in Capernaum, do also hear in thy country. And he and he said, verily I say unto you, no prophet is accepted in his own country. &gt;&gt; But I tell you of a truth. Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias. And the when the heavens was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land, but none of them was Elias sent, say Sarapa, the city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elias the prophet. And none of them was cleansed saving non the Syrian. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. [snorts] &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I know this is a very simple story, but it it can get real complex. So, if you'll just kind of give me a few moments to to speak it to you. Non being a great man, had a position, had great authority, he was recognized as a as as the captain of the host. He would be the five-star general. He would be kind of what Iran is is mourning today, a general that has been killed. And I'm not getting into politics, but they they looked to that sort of a man as a great man. &gt;&gt; This was a kind of a man that lived on a on a kind of a higher level. He people reverenced him. People watched him and they made over him. He was a man that had great authority with his tongue and with his with his words, with his speeches. He was a man that was what you might say greatly hailed as a great hero. &gt;&gt; He will be the man that will fulfill the scripture of Ahab's death. And he'll be the man that that will liberate Syria. And as a liberator, people want to worship him. No doubt making statues to him and spots in museums. He's a living legend now. Everybody is just completely completely enamored with his presence. You know, you just don't walk into the king and have an audience with him when you want to. But when you're a man named Non, you can do such &gt;&gt; interact with the upper echelon of the city, look to them and be able to to correspond with them. and you're the man that kind of everybody looks to. But Non was a different sort of fella. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; You see, he could he he carried something in his body that was a secret. &gt;&gt; Only the inner realm of his home would know this &gt;&gt; because to be a leper would take him into exile. &gt;&gt; Sure. as a leopard in that day. They they placed them on islands or places away or communities away amongst leper colonies &gt;&gt; because of the rotting of the flesh, the stench, the pulls, the the muscle deterioration, the literally limbs would fall off and hard conditions. That's right. &gt;&gt; This man was able to keep this &gt;&gt; from the public eye. &gt;&gt; This man was able to hide it and hold it very secretly. And then he's holding it very secretly. You know, everybody knows at home. You see a lot of times many people look out like on the outside as great overcomers. They can quote the message lyrics &gt;&gt; almost by heart. Dress the part. &gt;&gt; Look like great heroes. &gt;&gt; Look great to the community, the society and other other families and patrons and many of you that I'm sitting here and I don't have anyone pointed out but God sure does. &gt;&gt; And and to look and to see you. I I'd like to be like that home. I'd like my family to be like that family. I'd like for I'd like for for my myself to be like that. Not knowing &gt;&gt; that there's a secret. &gt;&gt; That elephant that is in the room &gt;&gt; that nobody talks about. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I preach this at my home church, too. [snorts] If you can just relax a moment with me, &gt;&gt; there was an answer in his house. &gt;&gt; You see, when he was away at war, he he took some treasures &gt;&gt; and in the treasures, he took a girl. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham will begin to share some things with us. They had a little girl there. I want to show you the force of a testimony of a child. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who lived in a nation perhaps a family who was under the influence of God. She loved her master. She loved her mistress. And when she seen Nab's non probably a good-hearted naturatured man as we know according to history, Elijah had never healed of a man of leprosy. There had never been a leper case in his day. Right. &gt;&gt; And the little girl being raised under the influence over in Israel, &gt;&gt; yet an alien, &gt;&gt; she was conducting herself as a believer. &gt;&gt; And that's the way that we should do all the time is conduct ourselves, no matter what our position is, conduct oursel as a believer, &gt;&gt; ready at all times to give an answer for the hope that lith within you. This little girl had been taken captive, not of her own will. &gt;&gt; She had been taken captive by the captain, not a sergeant, the captain of the host. &gt;&gt; Brought into his home. &gt;&gt; No doubt treated good, but it wasn't home. &gt;&gt; No doubt it was a nice home, but it wasn't home. No doubt she ate good food, but it wasn't home. &gt;&gt; No doubt they begin to love her, but it wasn't home. He wasn't father. She wasn't mother. There wasn't family. She wasn't home. &gt;&gt; But she found a spot in their life &gt;&gt; to where that they trusted her. &gt;&gt; She became the the little lady in the home that did so much many things. But being a captive, she had to deal with some things. Amen. &gt;&gt; She would see non as he walked in and take his armor off. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Take his shields and take all of that off. And he would go be from being the captain to daddy, &gt;&gt; captain to the husband. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Captain to the man in the home. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Major difference. Amen. &gt;&gt; Out there, everybody worshiped him in here. He was a man with leprosy &gt;&gt; and he would start unwrapping himself. No doubt the stench and the ooze and the bass and the and the all the different kind of things that they would try to do. Let me just say for him to go to the local doctor would out him. for him to go to to some physician to try to get himself help would tell the whole community &gt;&gt; non was a leper. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can read history. Once you was found out as a leper, you were exiled. Brother Tim, &gt;&gt; you know you work you work in India. &gt;&gt; You have to leave your family. Listen, nobody wants to leave your family. &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to destroy your family. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to come come to a spot to where that that you you want your whole family exposed. Nobody wants that. I understand that. &gt;&gt; But he was suffering with the disease of leprosy that was taking his life and taking everything about him. &gt;&gt; He didn't have an answer. &gt;&gt; I'd say that's a lot like sin. Sometimes sin will creep into lives unbeknownst, &gt;&gt; maybe innocent at a bit, and before long it attaches itself to you, no matter how great a warrior you are. &gt;&gt; And before long, because of as it moves in, it sells itself so well. Before long, your prayer life's gone, your dedication's gone, the tapes are gone. &gt;&gt; The moral factors begin to leave. And before long, if you're not careful, in the public eye, you're living one way. And in the private world, &gt;&gt; God knows. Amen. &gt;&gt; We get so so uh consumed by people spying in on us. We get consumed by cameras everywhere. You know, we live in a society of facial recognition. And uh they know everywhere we're at, what we're doing, what we buy, what we sell, what we're interested in. Our conversation becomes our next email. It just seems like everything is just just known about you. &gt;&gt; Well, that's not anything new. &gt;&gt; Satan didn't come up with that. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; He gets credit for being of the tree of knowledge, but he he didn't come up with that. God knows everything. &gt;&gt; He knows every situation of our life, the desires, the the patterns of our lives. He knows everything. He designed the predestinated seed that laid on the side of you and knew your strain of your humanity &gt;&gt; of the difficulties that you would deal with because of the passing from generation to generation and all of their qualities would fall down on top of you. &gt;&gt; And if I could just speak, sometimes we just need to be honest with oursel. We don't have the answer. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's no doctor we can go to, no psychologist we can go to. &gt;&gt; We are in a day to where people want to discredit credit the humanity of of our prophet. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He was honest with us. &gt;&gt; He was very honest with us and he he was overly honest with us. &gt;&gt; True. But if that same microscope could be used on you, &gt;&gt; I get a little infuriated and you forgive me. I get a little I'm 5'5, so so I have got a shorter fuse, but I get a little infuriated that people want to put a microscope on brother Brandham and not put it on their self. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And if we can look at brother Brandham would have been a murderer had God not stopped him. &gt;&gt; He would have shot those boys had God not stopped him. But God had a greater work. &gt;&gt; God wasn't looking at his human mistakes. &gt;&gt; Because there's a blood that was applied. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I think in the Old Testament sometimes as you're as if you being the writer that you've got to write certain parts in. &gt;&gt; I'm the meakest man of the earth. &gt;&gt; And knowing who you are, &gt;&gt; a temper caused me not to go into the promised land. There's some parts of David that he I'm sure he wish was not written. &gt;&gt; But they desired to live in a temple, not a temple made with hands, but they desired to live in a body to where that there would be something there. &gt;&gt; That would take dominion over the lust that they felt. &gt;&gt; They had a sacrifice. They had a blood of the bulls and goats, but it didn't change their nature. &gt;&gt; No, it didn't. &gt;&gt; But they served a holy God &gt;&gt; that no doubt that expressed his love to each and every one of them. And I'm being very generic now, but express his love. And they fulfilled prophecy and visions and they overcame wars. But they desired a change in their life &gt;&gt; to be restored and walk like Adam did in the Garden of Eden. What Adam stepped out of, we want to step into. [snorts] &gt;&gt; This little girl, she had the power to deliver him. If we could just take it just for a moment. This little girl had to overcome &gt;&gt; and forgive him for taking her captive. &gt;&gt; She had to deal with, yes, he's my captor. Yes, he has ruled over me. He's been good to me. But I could withhold deliverance from him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to just think. She's a young lady. And as a young lady, she's heard about incredible miracles, the power of God working through her prophet, &gt;&gt; and he has never healed a leper. But her faith &gt;&gt; though she be an alien, her faith was great enough in the God of the prophet &gt;&gt; that could take him into that realm &gt;&gt; to where that he could be healed. &gt;&gt; Though it had never been done, &gt;&gt; though it was the most dreaded disease that there ever was. And so she challenged him, "If you could get to my prophet, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; If you could get to my prophet, &gt;&gt; are you with me now?" What a prescription that she's giving. if you could get to my prophet. &gt;&gt; You as an audience have been wonderfully set for decades &gt;&gt; with one that sat on a log with a prophet. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You you've heard the stories. But listen, God wants to do more than just give you stories. &gt;&gt; We're not discrediting that. Whatever. He wants that same God, &gt;&gt; that same passion &gt;&gt; that was in the prophet that's in your pastor, &gt;&gt; that's in the ministry here, that [screaming] same God wants to live in your home. &gt;&gt; And if I may say this preemptively, leprosy of sin does not have to have dominion over your life. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; We have a prophet in Israel. And if you could get to him, I believe you'd be well. Do you know what this entails? This entails that I have to go to an enemy nation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This entails that I'm just not anybody. I'm a general. So, I could be an act in a war if I just, you know, where I go. Everybody knows where I'm at. If I go, you know, don't doubt there's a lot of so-called prophets here, but you're saying if I go to him, I'll be well. So, I've got to discredit all of these people. &gt;&gt; Now, he begins to blend the will of God for a bit. I'll go on my own terms. I think that's sometimes how people come to Christ. They want to do it on their own terms. &gt;&gt; They know that this is a recipe that produces wonderful families. &gt;&gt; They they know this is a recipe that has supernatural things that you can't explain. &gt;&gt; Some things you'll never understand. You just you just never be able to put a real thumb on it. This this is exactly how it happened. I don't know how you take 10% and you go much further than 100%. I &gt;&gt; I'll take care of your finances if you put me first. I'll take care of your family if you commit me and make me first place. Listen, you can't you can't come up with a formula that in that. &gt;&gt; I know you got a wonderful school, but there's not a formula for what God does. &gt;&gt; Amen. First of all, he had to come to grips with I can't live with this sin anymore. &gt;&gt; Leprosy anymore. &gt;&gt; I I can't live with this sin anymore. A leprosy anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm done with it. &gt;&gt; I've come to the end of it. It's rained over my life. No matter if I was winning a battle and I was cutting somebody's head off, still there was leprosy. &gt;&gt; When I unwrapped it, I smelled it. When I walked down the street, I had to make sure that nobody could smell the sin that was in my life. I had to make sure that I was clothed in a way to know where nobody. &gt;&gt; I had to make sure nobody knew what I was. &gt;&gt; But now a little girl in my home is challenging me. There's a prophet that's got an answer for you. &gt;&gt; There's a message that's got an answer for you. You don't have to live with pornography. You don't have to live with drugs. You don't have to live with running around on your wife or your husband. &gt;&gt; And the list is endless. &gt;&gt; But you don't have to live with sin in your life. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; I've been a while around a while now. One day I was sitting on a porch with a man. I was sitting with several brothers. I was sitting on the porch with a man and he was sitting beside of me and I was just sitting there and I just laid my hand over on his leg and I said, "When are you going to get rid of that little habit?" And he just looked at me like, "What happened?" I said, 'You know, I know what happened. When are you going to get rid of it? He said, ' Nobody knows.' I said, 'I do.' And I said, God just spoke it to me. When are you going to get rid of that? And he said, it's not hurting nobody. I said, really? Said, no. I said, "Your children know their children watch you put it in your mouth." I said, "You'll grow up. Their children will grow up. If you don't get rid of it, that little old habit will stay there and your children will grow up for a while. And once they get about this big, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; you'll start wanting to correct them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then they'll just look at you &gt;&gt; and go, "You didn't overcome &gt;&gt; and before long there'll be demons in your house you can't control." &gt;&gt; I said, "Let me just go just a little bit further. Let me just prophesy to you. There will come a time when your children are gone. your wife will leave and she'll take another man. Now I'm almost 30 years some from that event and his children are gone and his children fight with complexes and I prayed for them in prayer lines and because the father didn't commit they struggle. This ain't a good time to lock down. His wife did exactly that. Gone. But it could have all been fixed, brother Tim. &gt;&gt; By taking hands of a brothers and saying, "I'm naming and I need to come clean &gt;&gt; but you see, you got to go from hiding &gt;&gt; to saying, "I need help." Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, did brother Tom talk to you? I didn't even tell brother Tom what I was preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; You didn't talk to me. You've been overseas. Have you talked to your wife? I had someone else talking to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And non come to a spot to where I got to risk it all to get help. Now, it may be on the internet, but somebody may be sitting on the couch going, "Okay, it's time. I can't live a double life anymore, &gt;&gt; and I'm tired of living a double life, and I got to have help. I got some good news for you. I'm not a little girl in a in a captive situation. I'm a man of God standing commissioned by the word of God. &gt;&gt; There's a blood here for you. &gt;&gt; You can leave this service completely different than you walked in. &gt;&gt; Change can be gone. Prison doors be opened up. &gt;&gt; And walk out of here free. Brother Go, one of his dying requests to me was, "My son Isaiah would come to the Lord last night in Belgium. I got I got text all night long. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free." Isaiah came to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He came to the season of his life that he couldn't live that way no more. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And he found out there's a blood that'll take care of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Non sent letter to the king. He went to the king. I cannot imagine the conversation that he had to have with the king in a very private moment. You're talking about humiliation, intimidation, but he obviously did it with an attitude. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz attitude's everything. &gt;&gt; An attitude of &gt;&gt; I need help. But even in this attitude, he wanted to do it his own way. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to preach to you. &gt;&gt; This is not your own way gospel. &gt;&gt; I could care less about your bank account. &gt;&gt; I could care less about what you drive. &gt;&gt; I could care less of what your PhDs if you've got enough degrees on there to on your wall to have a thermometer. I'm not interested in none of that. &gt;&gt; It does not impress me. &gt;&gt; But are you right with God? &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in your name. Are you right with God? created a letter to have an audience with the prophet. Instead of going to the prophet, he went to the king. You know, sometimes in doing it your own way, it's kind of like brother Ram had to explain to us that God has a way &gt;&gt; and it's got to be that way. &gt;&gt; And he describes to us, lean not to your own understanding. &gt;&gt; He sermon after sermon, he drives it. It's not your way, it's his way. &gt;&gt; And so he sends a letter to the king and then he goes to the king. You know, God's not interested in parades. &gt;&gt; He's just not even interested in parades. So, he's able to cross borders, go to the king. He is able to work it out. And when he comes to the king, the king hears about it. And this man being of this stature and having this kind of a history, &gt;&gt; he rents his clothes. &gt;&gt; He said, "I can't do this. There's never been a leper healed &gt;&gt; and you're bringing leprosy to me. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; You have walked into my castle with leprosy. You brought it to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You brought death to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Do we not understand as a family, as homes, as structures, of churches, do we not understand that sin will destroy us? And brother man said, "You must destroy it before it destroys you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, in your mind's eye, what are you thinking preaching a sermon like this? This is a good way to start out a new year. [applause] You may have stumbled through last year and by grace you are still sitting here. But let me just say you can walk in victory. &gt;&gt; I may be only preaching to one but I'm preaching to that one. &gt;&gt; Cuz all of you been there. &gt;&gt; 100% has been here. &gt;&gt; 100%. I don't care what your name is. I'm not impressed. &gt;&gt; All of us. Yes, &gt;&gt; had been right here. &gt;&gt; We needed to get to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Found out where he was at. He made his way. Elijah sent word to the king. &gt;&gt; Send him on. &gt;&gt; Send him on. You're not going to You're not going to do any good down there. &gt;&gt; You're in the king's castle. You're not going to get healed. Here's where you got to get healed. &gt;&gt; Right. Let me just say, here's where the rapture's at. &gt;&gt; Here's where the resurrection's at. You can d all [screaming] all you want to out there. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Had a man walk up and hand me his card just a few moments ago. He's a preacher. He's preaching a meeting here here in this deal. Come from from Dawson Creek. and he just walked right straight up to me and an elderly man and introduced himself and and we began to talk for a few moments and and he and he was he's preaching a prescription this morning somewhere. I looked at his wife. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's all I needed to see. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; He needs this message. I told him you might what what what we have you might want to look on the website here the &gt;&gt; I didn't have an hour to talk to him. &gt;&gt; Come and see. &gt;&gt; Come and see. &gt;&gt; Come and see. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said if you go to a doctor &gt;&gt; he said you got to trust that doctor. &gt;&gt; He writes you a prescription. You got to trust that prescription. &gt;&gt; And he said you take it home you got to take it. Right. &gt;&gt; A lot of people want to sit in a pew with it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hollywood does not have all the Oscar winners. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, Hollywood don't have nothing &gt;&gt; on a lot of church people. I've met people that said, "I I'd like to been with the prophet." And I just say, "No, you wouldn't." Cuz you're not ready to meet God yet. Don't take that in the wrong way. But if I can see through you, [snorts] I could imagine as the servants now knew that non was [snorts] a leper, their faith now is if we can get him to the prophet, he'll be well. Our fears will be gone. If I can get my daddy into the presence of the Lord, my mother in the presence of the Lord, that alcohol and that porn and and all that, if if he could just really instead of just going to church, get it. &gt;&gt; Things will be different at home. Devotions will be different at home. [snorts] Interesting thing happens when they finally arrive at the prophet's house. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; you know, he's used to he's used to red carpet treatment. He's been to a lot of houses. &gt;&gt; He's used to maybe a dinnerer &gt;&gt; and the best of a dinner. &gt;&gt; He's used to having the best seat in the house. He's he's used to being applauded. He's used to be being a lot of things, treated a certain way, bowed to. &gt;&gt; He's used to a lot of a lot of dignities. Right. &gt;&gt; But when he comes to the prophet's house, &gt;&gt; prophet don't even come out. &gt;&gt; Knowing he's coming, send a letter, told him to come. &gt;&gt; Prophet don't even come out. He sends his servant out. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; Told him what he was there for. The servant goes in and I can just imagine him looking at his people. Well, this is some sort of a treatment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The servant comes out and says, "The prophet said to go wash in Jordan and dip seven times. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he begins to talk about the ingredients of the message. &gt;&gt; Do I have to go to church? &gt;&gt; Do I have to wear dresses? Do I have to clean everything out? If I'm going to wash, I'd like to wash in the beautiful Mediterranean pools. If it's requiring washing, I I I'd like to wash in a more dignified spot, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, I don't I don't need a guy with a no education. I I need a doctor &gt;&gt; speaking to me, you know, that'll use liy words. &gt;&gt; [laughter] [sighs and gasps] &gt;&gt; He got mad. &gt;&gt; He got mad at the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; He got mad at his cure. &gt;&gt; So at this spot, he loved the leprosy more than he did the word of God. &gt;&gt; And he had come to a spot, now he's arguing. He's having a temper tantrum. He's in that moment. Do I die out or do I do I continue with sin or &gt;&gt; he had some good counsel around him. &gt;&gt; Said just do what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; Listen, don't argue with this message. Just do what it said. &gt;&gt; You don't have to read nothing into it. Just believe what it said. It's simple. temple. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Someone sat at my table the other day and they were sitting there and said, "What an incredible family. How lucky you must be." And I looked at them. I said, "This has nothing to do with luck." &gt;&gt; Never been an argument at this table. This our table has the capacity to set 18. We have 16 seats. Well, it it's never had an open argument at that table. Never. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Never had an open argument. &gt;&gt; I've never had a continuous contentious moment to to where somebody got up and mad and walked out of the It's never happened at that table. &gt;&gt; It don't happen at a home. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; That home is a is a sanctuary to where I can walk into &gt;&gt; as a token applied. The devil's not welcome. His music is not welcome. His nonsense is not welcome. We're just not lucky. &gt;&gt; We applied a blood a long time ago. This message works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. You can't fool children. &gt;&gt; Little children see. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. &gt;&gt; They hear. &gt;&gt; They copy. &gt;&gt; They know what's right. Right &gt;&gt; now I'm speaking to the youth are all across this building. You know, &gt;&gt; but sometimes you as little children have got to break the cycle. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you as little children's got to break the cycle. If your mom and dad won't break the cycle, you break the cycle. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to live with that. &gt;&gt; This one backslide, that one backslide. Somebody's going to overcome. Somebody's going to be a real believer. I believe I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I stood with you in the in a meeting in China. I don't speak your language. Wish I did. I love your people. Go back in a moment. And I say that from my heart. Go back in a moment. You stood beside me in the prayer line and you you knew those people and God told them things I didn't know, but God told them things for hours. Six hours one night. God told you things that you knew. I didn't know, but he knowed. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; I looked into your eyes and you were told things you knew I didn't know, but he knew. &gt;&gt; Why would he do that to you? He &gt;&gt; cares. Amen. &gt;&gt; He cares. &gt;&gt; He cares. Why would people drive all across America to get to a prophet of God and maybe not get a prayer card? I grew up with a man that preached the message and he called it shotgun preaching. His name was Charlie Mitchell. And he walked into that meeting with a tumor on his left lung. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And he didn't get a prayer card. &gt;&gt; He didn't get he had no no chance of being able to walk across the stage. Huge meeting. Charlie was sitting there with a death sentence. And the other ministers had called out to him and said, "If you we can get you to the prophet, you'll be well." And they were sitting aside from him because I didn't get to sit with him. And brother Brandham calls out, I believe, Reverend Mr. Smith. And then he calls Charlie Mitchell. I knew that man. &gt;&gt; Charlie Mitchell was sitting there with a tumor on his left lung. I heard him say it over and over again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It was like an eye looking back at him. &gt;&gt; And he said, I ducked down for a minute. There it was. And he said, and he called my name and told me where I came from, told me my condition. The difference was he went home. &gt;&gt; The difference is is a lot of people can call you out and a lot of people can do a lot of different kind of things. But the difference is when you go home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I grew up watching Charlie Mitchell preach a shotgun sort of message and he called it starting out here and end up somewhere. He said, "I'm going to shoot all over the tree to get to you." I watched I watched people come out of wheelchairs with his faith. &gt;&gt; I watched I watched him preach the word of God. My father was an associate pastor in the church and later to become a pastor. I grew up with this kind of a faith. &gt;&gt; I grew up with this kind of faith. I grew up walking into a into a into a woman that was now 85 lbs and she had been about a 250 lb woman and she had a tumor on her throat and dad walked in and said, "I want you to go in and smell it." He said, "That's a smell of death. &gt;&gt; That's a smell of leprosy." Walked in there and he told her, he said, "Sister Barer, you'll live and not die." Laid his hand on that tumor and cursed it in the name of Jesus Christ. I'll tell you what, every weekend she would come back saying, "Charlie, I've gained five more pounds." &gt;&gt; And she was thrilled. She wasn't on no Weight Watcher program. She was thrilled when she went over 200 lb again. To God be the glory. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; God's not interested in a Hollywood body. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Amen. &gt;&gt; So many times we want to fool with the recipe, &gt;&gt; right? True. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that recipe is you can kind of work it a little bit is if you can get yourself to come every weekend, every couple weeks, just come to church. It'll soothe that feeling. It'll soo the feeling to where that you can go to church and then you can sin. You can go to church and you can sin. Before long, you've hushed the conscience. &gt;&gt; But let me just say, you know, &gt;&gt; there comes a point to where that you have to come to a point &gt;&gt; that you can't live that way no more. It's kind of like one time I was in a vision and I was walking off of this crater. It looked like a bomb had taken place to where this earth had been so destroyed and roads were destroyed and buildings were destroyed. And when I got to the bottom of a crater, everything was black and there was a girl standing there. Sister Connie was with me. And we walked down into that crater and I said, "Are you ready to leave now? Cuz things can't get no worse. Are you ready to leave?" And she said, "I'm ready." and we walk back up out of that crater. You see, nobody can make you do anything. You have to come to a spot to where I can live differently. &gt;&gt; You preached long enough to know that I'm dealing with quite a few things here. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The servant told him, said, "Go wash." &gt;&gt; Go wash. He made his way to the altar. He made his way to the Jordan. Brother Brandham said he was like a cat and sticky molasses. &gt;&gt; So he was down there putting his feet in it, kind of stomping in it. Muddy. It was nasty. It's where the waters come together. And it's a nasty place. &gt;&gt; He's not going to just put his feet in it. He's got to get in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, folks, he walked in here full of leprosy. &gt;&gt; And he walked down and he put his feet in that sticky water and mud. He put himself down in there. I don't know how deep. I don't I don't have that. But he got out to where he was standing in it and all he could see was mud. That's what represented his sin. He was and the prophet told him to dip &gt;&gt; and he dipped and he came up and he looked and it was still the same way. &gt;&gt; Have you tried before and you came up and it was still the same weight? You tried before and you came up and you're still the same way. &gt;&gt; He dipped. He came up. He dipped. And he came up. Maybe there was a spot or two that he felt like quitting. He did. He came up. He's a general. Everybody knows he's dipping. He dips. He comes up. The sixth time he dips, he looks down and he knows, "I'm just doing what the prophet tells me to do. &gt;&gt; I'm doing what that little girl told me to do." Brother Jonathan when he dipped this time, &gt;&gt; the vision of the prophet and the vision of that little girl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prescription and everything that had bound him in slavery, what he had lived in in secrecy, &gt;&gt; the thing that he had tried to hide all [screaming] this time, &gt;&gt; he was free. [cheering] [applause] He was free. &gt;&gt; It would never hold him bondage again. &gt;&gt; Smell of his flesh, it didn't stink no more. It wasn't oozing no more. &gt;&gt; He wasn't a slave no more. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to just notice what were you going to do after the miracle? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's one thing to have a miracle. It's one thing to have a transformation. But what are you going to do after today? &gt;&gt; What are you going to do this coming year? &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you I've been I've been wrestling this sermon as I'm going along. I haven't just been giving you a normal sermon. This is a year sermon for you. What are you going to do after the miracle? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He goes back to the prophet to give thanks and offer him all of his treasures. Listen, you're willing to give it all. &gt;&gt; You're willing to give whatever. He's brought incredible treasures to pro. He wasn't interested in that. &gt;&gt; He said, "At least let me take a a beast home with with with with buckets of dirt. &gt;&gt; [panting] &gt;&gt; Let me take dirt home. Brother Ron, what's the significance of him wanting to take dirt home? He wanted to be where that prophet had been. &gt;&gt; What God blessed that ground, that hollowed ground. I want to take some of this home with me. &gt;&gt; I want to take what's living in this church to my house. I want that same God to live on the inside of me. The same God that was in the prophet. The same God that's in my pastor. The same God in the one. I want [screaming] that same God. &gt;&gt; Preacher. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Don't soft soap yourself. &gt;&gt; Don't halfway. &gt;&gt; Don't live for decades behind a mask. Do you know who I am? Non. Yes, I do. &gt;&gt; But you need to wash. &gt;&gt; You need to wash. &gt;&gt; Are you getting it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cloverdale. God decided the first thing the first Sunday of the new year was to to give you a bath. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I may never get to preach again, &gt;&gt; but today &gt;&gt; God sent some bath water for you. [applause] &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; "Clean your fingers." &gt;&gt; Yep. Clean behind your ears. &gt;&gt; Clean the back of your head. Wash. I want to smell the I want to smell the soap. &gt;&gt; It's what you told your children. Did you take a bath? You didn't take a bath. How many moms could say that across this building? Every mom just said, "Yes, that's right. I've told my children, "Go take a bath." Did you brush your teeth, honey? Let me check. I watch my daughter-in-laws smell hands and I laugh cuz a few years ago I was smelling their father's hands. [laughter] And I'm sorry, so many times there still stinkers &gt;&gt; and you can wrap all kinds of things on it and you can put all kinds of clothes on it. But when you go home, you got to take it off. And when you look at the man in the mirror, &gt;&gt; you know, you know, &gt;&gt; you know why do we discredit prayer prayer lines or altar calls? Brother Brandham did it. I'll tell you why we do that. It's because we want to make it easy. &gt;&gt; We want to make it easy. Just evolve your way into the message. &gt;&gt; Just make it easy. You got to die. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I can't die for you. &gt;&gt; I was a homeless drug addict at one time and I had to die. Sister Tracy, you remember sitting in a service? I've heard your testimony so many times sitting in the service and God just began to sweep over your life. Many years ago, I brought my son that'll be here one day. I brought him to this meeting and I knew he was a stinker. He was my boy, but he was a stinker. He was dressing the part and combing the part and he was doing the part and he was at every service. But he was a stinker. Come on, brother Joel. You ought to be the best a man in this building. And you had a meeting that day. &gt;&gt; And later that night, he would have a meeting and you two would never be the same. &gt;&gt; Ben, you had a meeting in Edmonton and you would never be the same. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take 10 years. It just takes a few moments. &gt;&gt; Just a few moments. Jump, shout. I don't I don't care what you do there. That's not emotion comes with it. But let me just say, let that eternal moment happen. [screaming] &gt;&gt; That gene seed of God has got to come to life in the right atmosphere. Oh, holy God. &gt;&gt; Holy God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Ben, you said, "I'll never come back to church no more." And that's what you told your father. I'm done. I'm done with that. I'm done with that. And he said, "Brother Ron's speaking, isn't it right? It's what you told me in Edmonton." And he said, "I I'm done with that. I'm done with that." And you came that night and you were sitting the side of a pole and the Lord spoke to me three months before you'll preach this at Harold Hilderbrance on a Wednesday night. And I thought, I preach his convention. I'll never be there on a Wednesday night. And Tim Dodd calls me. Brother Tim Dodd calls me says, "I want you to come and preach a meeting." And brother Harold calls just before and he says, "You're going to brother Tims." He said, "Stop in Edmonton to speak on Wednesday night." And I had the service. While I was studying three months before, God told me, "This is the service that you'll preach." He knew you'd be coming to the muddy Jordan &gt;&gt; and you were an intricral part of that, not knowing that eternal seed had to come to life. and you invited me to that meeting. I slept in your basement. We had a wonderful time. Your boys played Nerf guns and we had a wonderful time at your home. &gt;&gt; But on the way, I would I would preach and it seemed like that nothing was happening, but God had came to you in that meeting. &gt;&gt; Did that end the wars of agony of wrestling with your humanity? I'd say absolutely not. There's probably been many spots in your life that if you could get equipped, &gt;&gt; circumstances come and situations come and stories come and all kind of history comes and everything comes together. But you know, &gt;&gt; sir, sir, &gt;&gt; but you know, &gt;&gt; but you [screaming] know that you know that you know that you know it's not you holding on. It's him holding on to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's greater than being healed of cancer. That's greater than walking being able to walk that eternal [screaming] part of you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That eternal part. You know what that's like, Sam? We stood at the lake at Mount Baker a couple years ago. You know what that's like? All of a sudden, you're in a moment. I know I've been a little lengthy, but I'm coming to an end now. &gt;&gt; But I want to I want to just capture just for a moment. You're in a moment. It's that moment that changes your life forever. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I've ever prayed for a service like I've prayed for this one. And I'm saying that in my own humanity because I know I know some of you are thinking this is so elementary. Three different people in this building has wrote me that this service is between life and death. So, do you think I walked into this building thinking, "Well, we're just going to have another good service and go to go to a restaurant, go rest this afternoon, and get ready for the service." Oh, no. This is between life and death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like for you to bow your heads now. Now's your opportunity. I've did my job. Now is your opportunity. non outed himself to get deliverance. Now is your opportunity. Young person, older person, I don't care what your age is, and I don't care what your name is. Now is your opportunity to come and get washed. Would there be a hand up in the building, Brother Ron? I've lived a double life and I need to raise my hand before God. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I need to wash. I need to wash. I need to wash. I need to wash. I need to wash. I need to wash tonight. I need to wash. Thank you. Those that's raised their hands. You know who's raised your hands and that's between you and God. I want you to stand to your feet. &gt;&gt; I want you to come and stand at this altar now and we're going to have prayer together. Maybe maybe if the song leader will sing a song of just before they're coming. I'm I'm sorry, brother Derek. I apologize. It's my fault. I'd like for us to sing a song just before we pray. Brother Derek, if you could do that, just create an atmosphere here. You are the earth [music] of my [music] heart. We [music and singing] are the God of all we are. I was the broken [music] bless. You look beyond [music] me. [music] of the building. [music] You touch my heart. [music] Now I hold on my [music] surrender. [singing] I give my heart [music] to you. The song [music] has brought me here to Lord [music] now [singing] to praise you. I [music] praise you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Brother Lou, &gt;&gt; you want this to go home? &gt;&gt; Yes, I have decided before you preaching. Yes, it's true. Thank you for your calling. I can feel the Holy Spirit walking both you and me the same [music] Holy Ghost. It's true. I have decided. &gt;&gt; This is a moment. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is a moment. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; A very sovereign moment. &gt;&gt; Yes. I know that it's the time for me to go home. I know this is is not your calling is from God. I'm sure I believe [music] God will never meet you in Japan. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I ask you now. [music] Touch this home. &gt;&gt; Touch our families. &gt;&gt; Oh God, the sin is great. Overwhelming [music] the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, what you send you protects [music] 91 is in order. Protect this whole family. May the sword of the Lord go forth with power Jesus. [music] You do the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ. [music] &gt;&gt; God, may it be like a book of Acts. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [singing] [music] Make me again. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. all across this audience. &gt;&gt; This is a sovereign move of God right here in this morning. &gt;&gt; It's a sovereign move. &gt;&gt; No man produces this.
