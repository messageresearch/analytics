[0:00] matter
[0:01] so little
[0:04] how much you may
[0:12] or the people
[0:14] you've known.
[0:17] It all comes to nothing
[0:21] when praised at his feet.
[0:25] It's nothing
[0:27] to Jesus,
[0:30] just meories
[0:32] to keep.
[0:37] Only
[0:38] one life,
[0:40] so soon it will pass.
[0:45] Only
[0:47] what's done
[0:49] for Christ will last.
[0:54] only
[0:56] one chance
[0:58] to do
[1:00] his will.
[1:02] So give to Jesus
[1:04] all your days.
[1:07] It's the only life that pays when you
[1:11] recall. You have but one life.
[1:19] You may take all the treasures
[1:24] from far away lands.
[1:28] Take all the riches
[1:32] you can hold in your hands.
[1:37] And take all the pleasures
[1:41] your riches
[1:43] can buy.
[1:45] But what will you have when it's your
[1:50] time to die?
[1:56] Only
[1:58] one life.
[2:00] So soon it will pass.
[2:05] Only
[2:06] what's done
[2:08] for Christ will last.
[2:13] only one chance
[2:17] to do his will.
[2:21] So give to Jesus
[2:24] all your days.
[2:26] It's the only life that pays when you
[2:30] recall. You have but one life.
[2:36] [Music]
[2:46] The days pass so
[2:51] the months come and go.
[2:55] The years melt away
[2:59] like new fallen snow.
[3:04] Spring turns to summer.
[3:08] Summer
[3:10] to fall.
[3:13] Autumn brings winter
[3:16] and death comes to all.
[3:23] Only
[3:24] one life,
[3:26] so soon it will pass.
[3:31] Only what's done
[3:35] for Christ will last,
[3:39] only
[3:41] one chance
[3:43] to do
[3:45] his will.
[3:47] So give to Jesus
[3:50] all your days. It's the only life that
[3:54] pays when you recall. You have but one
[4:00] life.
[4:04] One life.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why don't we sing
[4:18] number 430 on the screen? This is my
[4:20] desire to honor you.
[4:24] Brother Jeremy and a couple of sisters
[4:26] have a song, Jeremy Waldner. So maybe
[4:28] they could come while we're singing this
[4:30] a couple of times.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; This is my desire
[4:40] [Music]
[4:42] to honor
[4:45] you,
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Lord. With all my heart
[4:52] I worship you.
[4:59] &gt;&gt; All I have within me
[5:04] I give you praise.
[5:10] All that I adore
[5:14] is in you.
[5:21] Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my
[5:25] soul.
[5:28] I live for you alone. Every breath that
[5:33] I take, every moment I
[5:38] &gt;&gt; Lord have your way in me.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it again. Oh, this is my
[5:46] desire
[5:49] to honor
[5:52] you,
[5:54] Lord, with all my heart.
[5:58] I worship you.
[6:03] Oh,
[6:05] all I have within me,
[6:10] I give you praise.
[6:15] All that I adore
[6:19] is in you,
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Lord. I give you my heart. I give you my
[6:31] soul.
[6:33] I live for you alone. Every breath that
[6:38] I take, every moment I make,
[6:45] have your way in me.
[7:17] [Music]
[7:39] It is written
[7:41] that man shall not live by bread alone,
[7:48] but by every word that comes from the
[7:52] mouth of God.
[7:56] And by his word, he gave his son for us
[8:02] on Calary
[8:05] to pay the price of sin for you and for
[8:11] me.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; By his word,
[8:14] &gt;&gt; he raised the sick man from the veil. By
[8:18] his word
[8:18] &gt;&gt; he gave life unto the dead.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; By his word,
[8:23] &gt;&gt; oh he brings hope to the hopeless soul.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; To the hopeless soul by his word
[8:31] &gt;&gt; you can have the victory.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; For he has set the captive free.
[8:40] He gives life to you and me.
[8:46] [Music]
[8:55] Just one word was broken in Eden and
[8:59] that's what caused a fall.
[9:03] So it will take all of the word to bring
[9:08] us back to God.
[9:11] And through this last day message,
[9:15] all his word has been made known.
[9:20] And through its power, we have overcome.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; He spoke and squirrels of hair.
[9:33] Storm roll back from where you came.
[9:36] Little flesh, I give you back your life.
[9:40] He made your life.
[9:44] He spoke the tumor right of existence.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; He gave to voice salvation. Word. He
[9:53] gives life to you and me.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; By his word
[10:00] &gt;&gt; we'll be changed like Abraham and Sarah.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Be caught away like Elijah.
[10:08] [Music]
[10:09] We will raise the sleep and save
[10:12] &gt;&gt; raise
[10:15] by his word. Let go to a wedding supp.
[10:25] We will live eternally.
[10:30] By his word, we'll be changed like
[10:35] by his word be away like
[10:41] we will raise the sleeping ra
[10:50] [Music]
[10:52] to see our ris
[10:58] eternally.
[11:02] By his word we will live eternally.
[11:08] [Music]
[11:13] [Applause]
[11:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that
[11:23] &gt;&gt; by his word?
[11:24] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're here to hear this

[17:39] Let's just sing that chorus again as our

[17:58] I'm praising

[18:18] This is my song.
[18:24] Praising myior
[18:29] [Music]
[18:31] all the day long.
[18:37] Amen. God bless you. Wonderful day.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; It's always a good day in his presence,
[18:43] isn't it? I'll just have you have your
[18:45] seats for a few moments.
[18:49] Nice to see church full. And I know
[18:53] they're sitting in the sanctuary in the
[18:55] not only sanctuary, but in the
[18:56] fellowship room.
[18:58] Just uh yesterday I was uh just walking
[19:02] through a restaurant and uh looked down
[19:06] and and strange as it might seem, I had
[19:08] just mentioned this man's name. He's a a
[19:12] well well-known oldtimer from the
[19:15] Cloverdale area. And I had just
[19:18] mentioned his name to another person. I
[19:20] probably wouldn't mention his name in in
[19:22] years and years. I would have no reason
[19:24] to. Uh, and uh,
[19:29] I I walked through this restaurant and
[19:30] there he's sitting right there. And uh,
[19:33] so I called him by name and took him by
[19:35] the hand and he just didn't want to let
[19:37] go of my hand. He didn't know who I was
[19:38] to begin with. And and I gave him my
[19:41] name. I says, "It's Ed Piscll." Oh my.
[19:43] And he's sitting there with a younger
[19:45] lady and it was his daughter. And it
[19:48] turned out she had him there on his 83rd
[19:52] birthday. And uh I said I you won't
[19:55] believe this. I said in the last two
[19:57] hours I just spoke of you to another
[20:00] man. And I told him about you and and
[20:03] told him about you know a little bit
[20:05] about how I knew you and etc. etc. He
[20:08] had a trucking business right here in in
[20:10] Cloverdale. Just one or two trucks and
[20:13] you know just a a man at I he graveled
[20:16] for me when I built our house about 35
[20:21] years ago. And uh and so then he started
[20:24] speaking to his his daughter. He says he
[20:28] asked me, he said, "You you know, you're
[20:29] still connected with the the the church
[20:32] or Bible way or something." "Oh, yes." I
[20:34] said, "There's about 800." "Oh," he
[20:35] said. He started talking to his
[20:37] daughter. He said, "You can't even get
[20:38] in that parking lot." He he knew all
[20:41] about it. He knew more about it than a
[20:42] lot of other people. And here you you
[20:45] you don't realize you wouldn't think
[20:47] that a a just a lot of metal on rubber
[20:51] tires driving into a parking lot is a
[20:55] witness to anybody.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; But you're a witness every time you
[20:59] drive in.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; You're a witness every time you walk
[21:02] into the house of God because it raises
[21:05] a question. What's it all about?
[21:08] &gt;&gt; What is drawing those people there? What
[21:11] fills that parking lot on a Wednesday
[21:13] night? Why are they there? I had a
[21:16] pastor in this town tell me, he said, "I
[21:18] can't hardly get 10 people on Wednesday
[21:20] night." And they're just absolutely
[21:23] baffled.
[21:25] It's a good reason.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Good thing said, "Let the world be
[21:30] baffled.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Let the world be in wonderment."
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad we got something to shout
[21:36] about.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we got something to rejoice in.
[21:40] Glad we got something we can look
[21:42] forward to,
[21:43] &gt;&gt; you know, not just to be enthused, but
[21:45] something to be enthused about
[21:47] &gt;&gt; and to have a reason behind it.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'm enthused.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We just had uh uh thank
[21:56] you for your prayers. We just had uh
[21:58] services in Lima, Ohio with Brother Jeff
[22:02] Jenkins, and uh it was their annual
[22:05] family camp as well uh held right at
[22:08] their church. And uh it was probably
[22:13] I I would say the most outstanding
[22:15] meetings and uh that I've been in. I
[22:18] just spoke three of them. Brother Barry
[22:19] Coffee was there. Brother Eugene Braun
[22:22] uh also speaking participating in the
[22:25] meetings. But for whatever reason, and I
[22:28] don't try to I don't try to question God
[22:32] or to ask him, you know, why he does
[22:34] certain things at certain times, but
[22:37] there was just a
[22:39] a a very wonderful presence. And I
[22:42] believe that brother Jeff Jenkins said
[22:43] it right. He said it was really a
[22:45] two-part thing in that the presence of
[22:49] God was there, but also he said the
[22:51] people were so filled with expectation,
[22:54] he just couldn't get over that aspect of
[22:56] it. And to me, he hit the nerve because
[22:59] that was the key. And on a on our
[23:02] Saturday evening meeting,
[23:05] uh it was it was a very very unusual the
[23:08] presence of God. And then long after we
[23:11] left the service, uh, Brother Jeff told
[23:14] me they were there till 11:00
[23:17] or or after and people standing and
[23:19] people just sitting and people at the
[23:22] front and whatever more. I I perhaps had
[23:25] already left the service. I don't know.
[23:27] I don't want you to clap. I don't want
[23:29] you to rejoice because this is a I don't
[23:32] know exactly how to take just what I'm
[23:34] going to tell you now. I've never had
[23:35] any experience like this. I've never had
[23:38] it in a service that I've been in. And
[23:41] uh it it was uh it was a great victory.
[23:44] It was a great disappointment
[23:46] after I was speaking on I had just been
[23:48] speaking here on
[23:51] you as an individual and the bride of
[23:53] Jesus Christ being the expression
[23:57] you're not called to be you know uh
[24:01] workmen or plumbers or carpenters or
[24:04] business people or whatever more or or
[24:07] even housewives you are called to that
[24:10] but that's not your main purpose in
[24:12] life. your main purpose and the reason
[24:14] why you're here and the reason why God
[24:16] brought you here is to express the
[24:18] mystery of God which is Christ
[24:22] and and it was powerful and God came
[24:24] down and vindicated that message that
[24:28] that thought that theme. There was a
[24:32] woman in a wheelchair and been in a
[24:33] wheelchair for two years and she was in
[24:37] the back uh I think just outside of the
[24:40] sanctuary. Her husband was there
[24:43] wheeling her and another woman was there
[24:47] and this woman in the wheelchair said to
[24:49] the woman, she said,
[24:52] "I see Jesus Christ in you."
[24:56] And that woman turned around to her and
[24:58] said, "Well, if you see Jesus Christ in
[25:00] me, stand up out of that wheelchair and
[25:02] walk." That woman stood up out of that
[25:04] wheelchair,
[25:06] walked into the church, walked down to
[25:09] the front, and began to worship God. Her
[25:12] husband, in a stunned
[25:15] uh uh shock, took the wheelchair and
[25:19] followed her down
[25:21] all the way down to the front
[25:24] &gt;&gt; and was right behind her with the
[25:25] wheelchair. And when she was done
[25:28] worshiping and praising God like that,
[25:30] she looked around, saw the wheelchair,
[25:34] and went and sat back down in it and
[25:36] lost it.
[25:39] Just like that. Brother Brandham said,
[25:42] and we may take these things lightly,
[25:44] but we shouldn't. He said, "As sure as
[25:46] your faith will take it away, your doubt
[25:49] will bring it back."
[25:50] &gt;&gt; And he said, "She just glazed over." And
[25:53] brother Jeff even talked to her and it
[25:55] was just like a glaze had come over her
[25:57] and she couldn't hardly grasp what had
[26:00] happened and why she was now in that
[26:03] state again. It's a lesson for us. I
[26:06] wasn't going to tell you this, but I
[26:08] thought I would. It's a lesson for us.
[26:11] It's a lesson for us. Listen to it.
[26:15] That your faith will take it away
[26:18] and your doubt will bring it back.
[26:21] We need to really really and I pray that
[26:24] this woman will enter into that place
[26:26] again. I really do. I pray that she'll
[26:30] not have to go through life in that
[26:31] wheelchair. But I tell you what, if I'd
[26:34] been two years in a wheelchair and and
[26:37] and and got up and walk because I saw
[26:39] Christ in a woman, the last thing I'd
[26:42] want to do is sit back down in it. I'd
[26:44] say, "Take that thing and throw it off a
[26:47] bridge. I'm done with that."
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; And friends, you know, maybe you haven't
[26:53] got a wheelchair, but in one sense, we
[26:55] all do.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; We all have something we sit in. We all
[26:59] have something we rely on. We all have
[27:01] something that our unbelief causes us to
[27:04] to be hindered by and we want to be sure
[27:07] and get out of that thing.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; We also had while there were two young
[27:16] men that God spoke to at that same
[27:18] evening, both young men, one was a
[27:21] Pentecostal young man and another young
[27:24] man that had been hanging around on the
[27:26] per perimeter of the message, but had
[27:28] never dedicated his life to it. And God
[27:31] spoke to both of those young men that
[27:33] night. And both of them were baptized
[27:35] and received Christ in the fullness of
[27:37] his word. And that was a great victory.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:41] I mentioned the message hub. In fact, is
[27:44] we had uh the two videos that we've
[27:46] shown on the message hub here. The one
[27:49] with brother Derek introducing it and uh
[27:53] the one that uh uh brother Kim and
[27:55] brother Michael uh took when they were
[27:58] in the Philippines. It was about an
[28:00] 8-minute clip. So, I just said, "Well,
[28:03] maybe we'll just show both of these."
[28:04] And we we did show it to the people and
[28:07] and just exactly what we have so long
[28:11] for and desired. I said, "This is only
[28:12] second time we've shown this. We we
[28:15] showed it to our congregation, but we're
[28:17] not really ready. This is rather
[28:18] premature, but we're going to go ahead
[28:20] and I will just fill in here what uh
[28:23] what the vision is, what the objective
[28:25] is." And they they just caught it like
[28:28] that. And there was a brother from Kenya
[28:31] and he came forward and he says, "I've
[28:32] been a translator for years. I want to
[28:34] translate. The key is the when once a
[28:38] message is translated your people will
[28:41] be able to read it anywhere in the world
[28:43] probably within just a few hours.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; That's the key.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; And he came for he wrote a note and said
[28:49] I want one of those printers and I want
[28:51] to be a translator. And other brother
[28:53] was from Ghana there. Both of them were
[28:55] pastors. And then brother brother Barry
[28:58] Coffee who is just going to be going uh
[29:02] to Ukraine and in fact as I will be
[29:04] meeting him in the Ukraine in first week
[29:07] of October and then he's going on up to
[29:11] uh Moscow where we have sent funds from
[29:14] that's been given by uh some people that
[29:17] are streaming the service been given by
[29:19] people here in the church and we've
[29:22] already sent the first amount of funds
[29:24] over there. They are I think that was
[29:27] probably the first amount that
[29:28] substantial amount they received and
[29:31] they are so uh inspired. They are so
[29:35] quickened that they can now move forward
[29:37] and they're moving forward with the
[29:39] plans. Brother Barry is going over
[29:41] there. But as I spoke about the hub and
[29:44] about the printers and and you know I
[29:47] don't know
[29:48] uh just how you are going to take this
[29:51] but it it seems that it's just you know
[29:53] it's just the hand of God of of all the
[29:56] printers that were chosen to for the
[29:59] kiosk and for the hub and I was between
[30:02] brother Randy Snow's work brother Kim's
[30:04] work and anyway this one printer was
[30:07] chosen and of all of the printers
[30:09] probably hundreds that huelet Packard
[30:12] make they put that one on sale at half
[30:15] price.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; I just said I said you know God made
[30:19] them do that.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; And they they they said they'll be on
[30:23] pray on on half sale to the end of this
[30:26] month. So, Brother Barry Coffee and uh
[30:28] and the the church there, they got they
[30:30] got a bunch. They said, "We want to put
[30:32] between 15 and 20 of these print
[30:35] stations in uh in Russia and they're
[30:38] just taking it and making use of the hub
[30:40] that's been created and and uh got the
[30:43] message on it. Uh and more messages are
[30:45] going on all the time. I I'm just so
[30:48] delighted at what is happening and
[30:50] people are picking up on it. In fact, is
[30:52] this morning probably they they uh
[30:56] Brother Barry set it all up, connect it
[30:58] onto the internet in his church to show
[31:01] the people he bring he'll bring a
[31:03] message down and have it printed right
[31:05] there on the platform. I tell you what,
[31:08] people are getting it. He said he said
[31:10] outside of the initial search message,
[31:13] the search for the message which was
[31:15] done many many years ago and there's
[31:18] many of you here in the church that have
[31:19] it and that's what everyone uses. He
[31:21] said outside of that initial search for
[31:24] the message, he said this is in his
[31:27] estimation is the greatest thing that
[31:29] has happened since then. And I I am just
[31:33] so thankful that we can be a part of
[31:35] that. And I rejoice in it, friends. I
[31:38] rejoice in it. I don't know what your
[31:40] plans are. God might be in them. He
[31:42] might not be in them. I don't know. I
[31:44] don't know what your what your thoughts
[31:46] are. He might be in them. He might not
[31:48] be in them. But I'll tell you one thing.
[31:49] God is in this message.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; God loves this message. I don't know
[31:54] about your plans or where you're going
[31:56] or what you intend to do. And God may be
[31:58] in it. He may not be in it. But I do
[32:00] know that God's in this message. God's
[32:01] in this word. And whatever you can do to
[32:04] send that out, I don't care how you do
[32:06] it. God God will bless you for it.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; And we don't do it for blessing. We do
[32:11] it because it's our life.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Uh, our camp is coming up in just a a
[32:20] few more days. Really, it's rushing up
[32:22] on us so quickly.
[32:24] I want to say a few things to the
[32:27] congregation. First, I want to thank the
[32:30] congregation
[32:32] for the way that you have lived your
[32:35] lives,
[32:37] for your sacrifice,
[32:39] for your giving,
[32:42] for your labor
[32:44] and all and in every way. It includes
[32:47] everybody
[32:48] really includes everybody. Without your
[32:52] giving and support, we would not have
[32:53] been able to initially
[32:56] make the uh purchase possible which has
[32:59] happened. And without people coming
[33:02] forward
[33:03] uh such as our brother uh Chris uh
[33:06] Peterson and uh this congregation will
[33:09] really never know the amount of time
[33:13] that our brother Chris and then our
[33:15] brother Randy Snow making it uh making
[33:18] it a fireproof uh I won't say fireproof
[33:22] but fire prevention system throughout
[33:24] the place. You've heard me say some of
[33:26] this before, but I just want to take a
[33:28] few moments because we're rushing up now
[33:30] to our camp time. We have not done this
[33:35] to have a 44 acre camp out of Mount
[33:38] Baker. We've done it for whatever
[33:41] spiritual purpose
[33:44] God will do. You people have homes, you
[33:47] have apartments, you have condos or
[33:50] whatever that you live in. Uh, and you
[33:53] might say, well, I bought this home
[33:55] because I needed it. My family needed
[33:57] it. My or have to have a place to live.
[33:59] I bought this place because I've got to
[34:01] have a place to work. But the ultimate
[34:04] the ultimate purpose and objective in
[34:06] everybody's life. And these are kind of
[34:08] four pre
[34:11] uh comments before my message today. But
[34:14] the real reason we do these things is
[34:17] because our whole life and everything we
[34:21] do is towards God.
[34:24] All of you that have contributed and
[34:27] have volunteered your time and given
[34:29] your time. I we don't want to wear you
[34:32] out. We don't want to burn you out. But
[34:34] I want to say this. It's like riding a
[34:36] bicycle. You know, you ride a bicycle.
[34:39] uh you might get all played out or you
[34:41] you you do something that takes up your
[34:43] energy, but when you're done, you know
[34:46] what happens? Uh you rest a little while
[34:49] and God gives you that energy back.
[34:52] Isn't that amazing?
[34:54] &gt;&gt; So, you've been out at camp and you've
[34:56] worked and you've labored and you've
[34:57] given and and we thank you for that.
[35:00] More than that, I believe that God who
[35:03] keeps an accurate set of books, he knows
[35:06] exactly
[35:08] what you have done and how you have
[35:10] prayed and so on so forth. And then and
[35:13] then you get all wearied out, but you
[35:15] have a little rest and you know what? It
[35:17] comes back
[35:19] &gt;&gt; and you're renewed again. You didn't
[35:21] have to put anything in the slot machine
[35:23] to get it. God just gave you the
[35:25] strength back.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; So, you gave it freely, but God also
[35:28] gave you freely. He gave it all back.
[35:31] So, I would just say to the
[35:32] congregation, you make yourself
[35:34] available. We need uh you I think we've
[35:37] got counselors and then there's uh staff
[35:39] that's needed in the in the kitchen in
[35:42] the camp and not only our camp but uh
[35:45] we're trying rushing right now to get
[35:47] finished and brother Chris, brother
[35:48] Randy just needing whatever kind of
[35:51] help. And if they make known to you if
[35:54] you can uh you know give a few hours of
[35:56] time it'll be so so helpful. They're
[35:59] just finishing the last things. And I
[36:02] don't know you out there at the
[36:03] fellowship room at the fellowship day I
[36:05] should say but very much has taken place
[36:08] even since then. And it's going to be a
[36:10] place it's going to be a place it's
[36:12] going to be a retreat. It'll be a place
[36:14] where you'll be able to go where you'll
[36:17] be able to just be in that kind of
[36:20] atmosphere. And now it brings me to uh
[36:23] my last point on this and that is
[36:26] I would like to call on this
[36:28] congregation
[36:30] to take uh specific time and quality
[36:35] time and set it aside and get alone with
[36:39] God and pray for this camp.
[36:43] I feel that God wants to visit us in a
[36:46] special way.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; I desire the supernatural.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; We don't just desire to have a lot of
[36:54] preaching. We don't desire just to have
[36:56] music and worship, but we desire to see
[36:59] the supernatural hand of God.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; And I want I want to bring you to a
[37:04] place of expectation.
[37:06] Why should we not believe? For all
[37:09] things are possible to them that
[37:12] believe. Are we believers?
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to confess you're a
[37:16] believer. You know, we've had sicknesses
[37:18] and things hang on and diseases and
[37:20] things hang on and infirmities and
[37:22] things hang on and and and if it and if
[37:25] those things don't take place, Brother
[37:27] Brandham right at the end of his
[37:28] ministry still had sisters in
[37:30] wheelchairs that were sitting right
[37:31] there and he said, "She's like a
[37:33] beautiful flower here amongst us." That
[37:35] then that's God's part. But let not our
[37:38] faith be diluted. Let not our faith be
[37:42] diminished. We want to believe for all
[37:44] things are possible.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Why settle for less?
[37:50] &gt;&gt; We want to see the supernatural amongst
[37:52] us. And the greatest supernatural be
[37:54] supernatural spiritual deliverance.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; And so that is why I would like to ask
[38:01] you to that's more than volunteering.
[38:05] We're not volunteering. We're doing
[38:07] something that's a part of our life and
[38:09] that is to pray for a special pray for
[38:13] you. I'll give you some specific things
[38:15] to pray for. Pray that God will give me
[38:18] wisdom. Pray that God will give the
[38:21] brothers in charge. Brother Tom, Sister
[38:23] Joanne, Brother Jess, Sister Lynn,
[38:25] Brother Tom Frey, and his his good wife
[38:29] to and and they take charge of of
[38:31] aspects of it. Brother Raymond and
[38:33] Sister Raesa and all the sisters, you
[38:36] sisters, sister Karen and Sister Karen
[38:39] Hendrickson here and people that have
[38:41] taken just given themselves so
[38:43] unreservedly. We appreciate it, don't
[38:45] we?
[38:46] &gt;&gt; I know that you do. And I don't think
[38:48] there's anything wrong with saying God
[38:50] bless them
[38:51] &gt;&gt; and God bless you, each one of you,
[38:54] because I know that you have so given.
[38:56] And I'm and so I'm not talking about
[38:57] that for camp. I'm talking about that
[38:59] for what God wants to do.
[39:02] Hallelujah.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; I want to see sons and daughters. And
[39:07] this is the largest camp we've ever had.
[39:10] We've maxed out completely in the senior
[39:14] camp. The senior camp is around 350
[39:17] right now and we've been below 200. All
[39:21] we've filled it up. We're putting and
[39:23] people are just saying we're just coming
[39:25] and we don't know where to put them. And
[39:28] uh and there's people who wanted to come
[39:30] and they've said, "We've heard that it's
[39:31] an exclusive camp that nobody can get
[39:33] in." I said, "No." I had to answer them
[39:36] because they were quite upset about it.
[39:38] I said, "No, it's not an exclusive camp,
[39:40] but you'll have to get a motel
[39:41] someplace. We only have so much only so
[39:44] much beds. That's what's exclusive about
[39:46] it. And after that, then you can you can
[39:49] just come to the meetings." The meetings
[39:50] are open in the evening. Let's pray for
[39:53] the for the speaker, our brother Ron.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe God spared him. Don't
[39:58] you?
[40:00] &gt;&gt; I believe God spared him for one of the
[40:02] purposes. He spared him is to be here
[40:04] with us.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; And if God spared him for that purpose,
[40:08] I believe that God has certain words
[40:09] already set aside. Not for last week,
[40:12] but for and but for that time. Amen. And
[40:16] I want you to come to the I want you to
[40:18] come out of those grounds with that in
[40:20] your heart. God preserved this speaker.
[40:24] When death tried to take him and Satan
[40:26] tried to take him, God preserved him and
[40:28] he's coming here with words of God and
[40:30] he's going to utter them. And I want you
[40:32] to believe that this morning.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; I could have gone a long time ago, but
[40:38] God's preserved me and I believe
[40:41] preserved me to be here and have
[40:43] something for you.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to take it and receive
[40:47] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:49] All right. Thank you for the songs that
[40:51] the sisters sang and and uh Sister
[40:56] Hannah and Esther and Naomi. I
[40:58] appreciate that song so very very much.
[41:01] And brother Jeremy along with Sister
[41:03] Lesanne
[41:05] and Sister Florence and Sister
[41:07] Elizabeth. We appreciate those words the
[41:10] concerning the blood of Jesus Christ.
[41:12] Well, I've taken a little extra time,
[41:14] but I feel that I that's my privilege.
[41:18] Why don't you stand with us?
[41:25] Just before we turn to the word, I'd
[41:27] like to pray with you.
[41:32] What a wonderful moment this is, Lord
[41:35] Jesus, that we can
[41:39] refer
[41:40] and and bring ourselves and refer to
[41:42] you, oh God, as our father.
[41:46] And we uh we love Lord this these
[41:49] moments when we can be together and and
[41:52] sense your divine nearness and just have
[41:56] evidence Lord even as I've related to
[41:58] the people of the things that you have
[42:00] done. Lord I rejoice to see you two
[42:03] young strong men who had resisted giving
[42:08] themselves so freely but then your
[42:11] presence overwhelmed them. Lord, I think
[42:14] of the woman who got up out of the
[42:15] wheelchair. I pray that even now,
[42:18] Father, that that will have come back on
[42:20] her. I pray that she's already out of it
[42:22] again, Lord. I pray she'll be out of it
[42:24] for the rest of her life, Father.
[42:26] Whatever you have in store for her. And
[42:28] whatever you desire to do, Lord, amongst
[42:30] us, not only today, not only in this
[42:34] service, but in our individual lives,
[42:36] when we move about the town, when we
[42:39] move about our work, when we moved about
[42:42] our community and amongst our associates
[42:44] and friends, and especially when we move
[42:47] about the body of Christ, may we be a
[42:50] dedicated, sanctified, holy vessel for
[42:53] you. May we be a strength to one
[42:55] another. Oh God, I pray you'll banish
[42:58] every doubt. I pray you'll banish every
[43:00] wrong amongst us. Oh God, I pray you'll
[43:03] remove every obstacle in the name of
[43:06] Jesus Christ. You said whatsoever you
[43:08] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.
[43:12] We bind the efforts of the enemy. We
[43:15] bind Satan against uh against his
[43:18] purpose and his will. We bind him, oh
[43:20] God, according to your word and
[43:23] according to your promise. And now,
[43:25] Father, I pray there will be a mighty
[43:26] release of the Holy Spirit upon the
[43:30] people, upon our hearts. Oh God, if
[43:32] there's a heart that's out of place, out
[43:34] of tune, I pray, Lord, they will just
[43:36] come into harmony now with your will. Oh
[43:40] Lord, I pray you'll open your word, send
[43:42] a spirit of revelation upon us that we
[43:45] might see clearly. And I pray you'll
[43:46] anoint us, anoint myself, Father, as I
[43:49] give myself to you. and each one, Lord,
[43:52] as they receive your word, may it fall
[43:54] into good ground. I pray in Jesus
[43:56] Christ's name. Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'll invite you to
[44:02] uh take your Bible if you would please
[44:04] in turning to Genesis. And while you're
[44:06] turning to Genesis, I the 32nd chapter.
[44:10] Actually, I want to also say that I have
[44:14] heard from so many places how blessed
[44:17] you were uh last Sunday, Brother Lance's
[44:20] service.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I heard he broke all time records.
[44:24] And I'm glad that we shattered that time
[44:27] zone for Brother Lance. God bless you,
[44:30] Brother Lance.
[44:32] Amen. Hallelujah. I think preacher needs
[44:34] to forget the clock sometime. And that's
[44:37] what these Sunday morning services we
[44:39] don't have a a evening service uh right
[44:43] now and during this time but they do
[44:45] have the service in Seattle. So we are
[44:48] mindful of that as well. But uh uh us
[44:52] preachers we need lots of help. God
[44:55] bless you. All right. In the 32nd
[44:57] chapter I'm going to be skipping some
[45:00] verses. We'll read verse 1 2 and 3 and
[45:05] then 6 and 7 and then 9 10 11 and 12 and
[45:10] then I'll be jumping down to verse 20.
[45:13] This is about Jacob just to give you the
[45:14] background. And Jacob went on his way
[45:17] and the angels of God met him. And when
[45:20] Jacob saw them, he said, "Uh, this is
[45:23] God's host." And he called the name of
[45:25] that place Mahanim.
[45:28] And Jacob sent messengers before him to
[45:31] Esau his brother unto the land of Sire,
[45:35] the country of Edom. And the messengers
[45:39] returned to Jacob. Verse six, saying, We
[45:43] came to thy brother Esau, and also he
[45:46] cometh to meet thee, and 400 men with
[45:49] him. And then Jacob was greatly afraid
[45:52] and distressed. And he divided the
[45:55] people that was with him and the flocks
[45:58] and herds and the camels into two bands.
[46:02] Verse n. And Jacob said, this is his
[46:06] prayer. Oh God, my father Abraham, and
[46:09] God of my father Isaac, the Lord, which
[46:13] said unto me, return unto thy country,
[46:17] and to the kindred, thy kindred, and I
[46:20] will deal well with thee. Now, he's
[46:21] rehearsing to the Lord what God has
[46:24] spoken to him. Verse 10. I am not worthy
[46:28] of the least of all thy mere mercies,
[46:31] and of all the truth which thou hast
[46:34] showed unto thy servant. For with my
[46:37] staff I have passed over this Jordan,
[46:40] and now I am become two bands. Deliver
[46:43] me, I pray thee, from the hand of my
[46:45] brother, from the hand of Esau, for I
[46:47] fear him, lest he will come and smite me
[46:51] and the mother of the children. and thou
[46:54] hast uh and thou saidest, I will surely
[46:58] do thee good and make thy seed as the
[47:01] sand of the sea, which uh cannot be
[47:05] numbered for multitude. Now, that is
[47:07] kind of a uh just a
[47:10] preamble to the message, which I would
[47:12] like now to focus on verse 24.
[47:16] And Jacob was left alone because Jacob's
[47:19] he sends gifts to Esau and then he sends
[47:22] his family from him and he's left alone.
[47:26] And there wrestled a man with him until
[47:28] the breaking of the day. And when he saw
[47:31] that he prevailed not against him, he
[47:33] touched the hollow of his thigh. And the
[47:36] hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint
[47:39] as he wrestled with him. And he said,
[47:42] "Let me go, for the day breakth." And he
[47:46] said, "I will not let thee go." That's
[47:48] the angel said, "Let me go."
[47:51] And Jacob has said, "I will not let thee
[47:53] go except thou bless me." Notice now he
[47:56] this is one that has already received
[47:58] the blessing. But now this is something
[48:01] beyond the blessing of the birthright
[48:04] and the blessing of his father Isaac.
[48:08] He's gone now. Now there's something
[48:10] within him. He recognizes. You may not
[48:12] know exactly who this person is, but he
[48:15] said, "I will not let you go except thou
[48:17] bless me." And he said unto him, "What
[48:20] is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob." And
[48:23] he said, "Thy name shall be called no
[48:26] more Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince
[48:31] has thou power with God, and with men,
[48:35] and hast prevailed." And Jacob asked
[48:37] him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy
[48:39] name. And he said, "Wherefore is it that
[48:43] thou dost ask after my name?" And he
[48:46] blessed him there.
[48:49] And Jacob called the name of the place
[48:53] Peninoale,
[48:54] which is meaning facing God. For I have
[48:58] seen God face to face, and my life is
[49:02] preserved."
[49:03] And as he passed over Penoale, the sun
[49:06] rose upon him and he halted upon his
[49:11] thigh.
[49:13] Now he said, "I have seen God." Verse
[49:16] 30, if you look please, I have seen God
[49:20] face to face and my life is preserved.
[49:24] You may be seated.
[49:36] I'm going to
[49:38] ask for your undivided attention and
[49:40] your full focus
[49:43] because you're
[49:45] sometimes it's difficult and I feel a a
[49:47] challenge for as a as a minister feel a
[49:51] challenge to try to get a whole group of
[49:54] people to follow the thought as God has
[49:56] brought it to me because sometimes it
[49:58] seems that you you need some distance
[50:01] you know there's a distance between one
[50:03] thought and the next thought so just ask
[50:05] the Holy Spirit now to give you the same
[50:08] kind of understanding and the way he
[50:10] spoke to me about this I want to speak
[50:14] on my life is preserved
[50:17] and Jacob ties that directly in to
[50:21] seeing God face to face said I've seen
[50:25] God face to face
[50:27] and my life is preserved served
[50:32] in the
[50:34] in the patmas vision
[50:37] when John the apostle saw the Lord Jesus
[50:40] Christ.
[50:42] Now he never he did not see him as he
[50:44] knew him on earth. This was a very very
[50:48] different scene. It was so different and
[50:51] so numbing and so consuming upon him
[50:55] that when he saw him, he fell at his
[50:57] feet as one dead. He never did that in
[51:00] life. Never once did John fall at the
[51:04] feet of Jesus Christ in flesh as one
[51:07] dead. But when he saw him now in the
[51:10] revelation, he fell at his feet as one
[51:12] dead. And uh brother Brandham brings out
[51:17] uh that uh the seven descriptions of his
[51:21] personage.
[51:23] The seven description there's seven
[51:25] church ages. And just watch now the
[51:27] seven descriptions. And his head and his
[51:30] hairs were white like wool, as white as
[51:34] snow. Number one. His eyes were as a
[51:39] flame of fire. Number two. and his feet
[51:43] like unto fine brass as if they burned
[51:46] in a furnace. Number three, his voice as
[51:50] the sound of many waters. Number four,
[51:54] and he had in his right hand seven
[51:56] stars. Number five, and out of his mouth
[52:00] went a sharp two-edged sword. Number
[52:03] six, and his countenance,
[52:06] his face was as it were the sun that
[52:10] shineth in its strength. Number seven,
[52:14] in the scripture, when you saw the face,
[52:17] we saw him face to face. That is that
[52:20] you now met the person,
[52:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Not you're not just seeing a part of the
[52:26] person, but you have met the person. And
[52:29] that is why the words are even
[52:31] interchangeable in the scripture
[52:33] concerning the face uh panim in the in
[52:37] the old testament the face of the person
[52:40] was the person and when they when you
[52:43] saw their face that meant the person was
[52:46] now present.
[52:48] I want you to hang on to that. The
[52:50] seventh the seventh church age. The
[52:53] seventh church age as I saw his
[52:56] countenance and there was no more
[52:57] description after that. That was now the
[53:00] total person was present in the seventh
[53:03] church age. That is the purpose of our
[53:07] day is not that we should have another
[53:10] blessing or learn something more about
[53:13] God but that God would make himself
[53:16] present amongst a people.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:22] I understand we're going to have a
[53:23] wedding here this coming Saturday.
[53:27] I can tell you for those of you that
[53:29] come here and attend the wedding, it
[53:32] won't be a bride with a groom in her
[53:36] imagination.
[53:38] And it won't be a groom standing here
[53:40] with no no bride. Just him in his
[53:44] imagination. and said, "Well, I'm
[53:45] imagining she's there, or I'm imagining
[53:48] he's there. I have a perfectly pictured
[53:51] in I have a perfect image in my mind."
[53:53] That won't do it.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; That just not going to suffice. The
[53:57] person has to be present and they want
[53:59] to turn towards each other and look each
[54:01] other face to face. We didn't marry
[54:04] something imaginary. We didn't come to
[54:07] this wedding. We're the prophet said,
[54:09] "We're married here."
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not married here to
[54:13] some some image in our mind or some
[54:15] historical figure of the past.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; And if that's what we would have, then
[54:19] you don't know him yet. But you're
[54:21] married to one who has come present. How
[54:23] did we come to know him? Because he
[54:25] unveiled himself. He made himself known
[54:27] in his word. This is me. I'm describing
[54:31] myself accurately, perfectly, precisely,
[54:34] and my spirit of my person has come to
[54:37] make that word alive.
[54:39] Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; And so the seventh age messenger
[54:45] the seventh age and the messenger
[54:48] you have been brought face to face
[54:53] or have been brought we'll put it
[54:55] another word. You've been brought face
[54:56] to face or you have been brought into
[54:59] the presence of that person into the
[55:03] presence of this one that's been
[55:05] described. And then Revelation 10:1.
[55:08] Notice now, brother Brennan goes back to
[55:11] Revelation the first chapter and says
[55:15] the same person. So he says, "And I saw
[55:17] another mighty angel come down from
[55:20] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[55:23] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[55:26] was as it were the sun." The reason why
[55:29] now his face becomes uh becomes a key uh
[55:34] a a key part of this verse is because
[55:36] it's his person. Now notice also he said
[55:40] a rainbow was upon his head. That's a
[55:42] covenant. That was the word part. And
[55:44] his face was as it were the sun. That's
[55:47] the person himself is present. And his
[55:49] feet as pillars of fire. It's important
[55:53] to recognize that his face and his feet
[55:56] are represent his person and his feet is
[56:00] always identified with judgment. If you
[56:02] look in re in Revelation 1, his feet
[56:05] were like fine brass that burned in the
[56:08] fire and brass all through the scripture
[56:11] is judgment. when he came when he came
[56:15] uh when he came in the time of Noah and
[56:18] you know that deliverance the god of
[56:20] deliverance was the god of judgment at
[56:23] the same time the same water that
[56:26] delivered the people was the same water
[56:29] that destroyed the others you follow
[56:32] that so it was important now he's coming
[56:35] a mighty messenger coming descending
[56:38] with the covenant with the word and it's
[56:42] not now just sending someone but it's
[56:45] the person himself his face is is once
[56:49] again identified because it's his person
[56:51] his own personal presence that is coming
[56:54] will be there and he has to have because
[56:57] he's not coming into a physical body
[56:59] like he did when he was born of a virgin
[57:03] but he's coming now to use a redeemed
[57:05] vessel so he comes through a prophet
[57:08] messenger in the end time and that is
[57:10] why that is I brother Brandham had to
[57:12] say for 30 33 years that's not me that's
[57:18] him. Had to keep saying it. It's not me
[57:21] it's him. Why did he have to say that?
[57:23] Because the people could feel that
[57:25] strange that fain almost un unearly
[57:29] presence. He wanted them to know that's
[57:32] not me. That's not just some mystic.
[57:35] That's him.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; That's the resurrected Christ. I can
[57:39] prove to you that he's here.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not I can prove to you he's
[57:43] coming. I can prove to you that he's
[57:46] present. He was saying
[57:47] &gt;&gt; and that's the word we've believed.
[57:49] That's the word that's unveiled him.
[57:51] That's the word that you if you believe
[57:53] in it, you'll come to know him in
[57:56] reality.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the feet and the face speak of
[58:01] exactly the same. The revelation of
[58:03] Jesus Christ is to see. The revelation
[58:06] of Jesus Christ is to see the very face
[58:09] of God. And to see him is to receive
[58:12] him. To see him, I'm repeating, is to
[58:15] either receive him or to reject him. To
[58:19] receive him is life and to reject him is
[58:24] death. There's no way around it.
[58:27] Jacob wrestled with the angel and God
[58:30] changed his name.
[58:33] a person's life, his life, his character
[58:36] from Jacob to Israel. It's really quite
[58:40] uh uh it's quite interesting. In fact,
[58:43] is it's mentally challenging to think of
[58:46] the times that Jacob was referred to in
[58:49] the New Testament. And he's they always
[58:52] call him Jacob,
[58:54] but Jacob was changed. The whole nation
[58:56] of people that came out of him, for out
[58:58] of him came the patriarchs, and out of
[59:00] them came the whole nation. And that is
[59:03] why they call it Israel. That's how come
[59:05] Israel is called Israel. It's called the
[59:07] land of Israel. It's the land of Jacob.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the land of the
[59:12] patriarchs. That's what came out of him.
[59:15] It's the land of the birthright.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; That was his birthright
[59:20] &gt;&gt; to bring forth. Got to keep myself or
[59:23] I'll be going ahead of what I want to
[59:26] get to. So, Jacob received the blessing.
[59:29] Now the Bible says uh the Bible says
[59:33] that of him that you have prevailed that
[59:36] Jacob has prevailed
[59:39] and because he prevailed he is a a
[59:42] prince and he prevailed the scripture
[59:46] your name will be no more Jacob for as a
[59:48] prince thou hast power with God and with
[59:52] man and hast prevailed. Don't you find
[59:55] it a paradox? This is a man that just
[59:59] been running from his troubles.
[1:00:02] This is a man who just sent his wives
[1:00:05] and their children across the creek,
[1:00:08] across the river ahead of him. This is a
[1:00:11] man who just sent a few hundred animals
[1:00:14] as a gift to his brother because he
[1:00:17] feels his brother's going to kill him or
[1:00:20] do some damage. is a man. He still knows
[1:00:22] but he has an abiding
[1:00:25] knowledge. He has abiding faith that I
[1:00:29] have the birthrightmen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; I have the inheritance. That's going to
[1:00:33] be very very very important as we move
[1:00:36] through the rest of the message. So he
[1:00:38] he had received the blessing but yet in
[1:00:42] another sense and I want you to follow
[1:00:45] me very closely. Jacob had prevailed.
[1:00:48] But in another sense, it was God that
[1:00:51] had actually prevailed. God had
[1:00:54] prevailed in bringing him to a place and
[1:00:57] into an experience that changed him. Up
[1:01:01] to that moment, he was a shyster.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Up to that moment, he was a deceiver. Up
[1:01:08] to that moment, he contrived. He
[1:01:10] deceived his brother. He conceived his
[1:01:13] his daddy who was a prophet. He deceived
[1:01:16] all the people around him. He he was a
[1:01:19] he was a deceiver. He just had that uh
[1:01:22] kind of nature with him. But at that
[1:01:25] moment he was changed. And by being
[1:01:28] changed he could come into the lineage
[1:01:31] and the fatherhood of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; So God had prevailed. God had prevailed
[1:01:37] in advancing the mystery that he was
[1:01:41] unfolding out of the eternities that of
[1:01:44] Christ, this anointing which I've been
[1:01:46] speaking about in advancing the whole
[1:01:51] program of redemption. And God was not
[1:01:54] going to change his mind. God was going
[1:01:57] to be the God of Abraham, the God of
[1:01:58] Isaac, and the God of Jacob. That's all
[1:02:00] there was to it. God was going to be the
[1:02:03] God of those and that was going to be
[1:02:05] the foundation and out of Jacob it
[1:02:07] couldn't change. He had to bring forth
[1:02:09] the patriarchs. You agree with that?
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; When I say that, I want you to also be
[1:02:15] able to personalize it and internalize
[1:02:18] it for your own self that God who
[1:02:22] brought you here and has a purpose in
[1:02:24] your life, he's not going to change his
[1:02:26] mind about that.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; He's going to do what he's going to do.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to surrender.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; I want to dedicate myself to God's
[1:02:36] program
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; rather than have our program.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; And so God prevailed. It says that Jacob
[1:02:44] prevailed and and indeed he did. But God
[1:02:46] prevailed in advancing his great
[1:02:49] unfolding of his mystery uh in revealing
[1:02:53] of Christ and bringing forth Christ.
[1:02:58] In a message identified masterpiece of
[1:03:01] God the prophet said and Jacob which
[1:03:05] means surppler
[1:03:07] and that's a deceiver and we realize
[1:03:10] that Jacob's life really represented
[1:03:13] grace because it was grace of God all
[1:03:17] the time with Jacob. So it was a it was
[1:03:21] a it's a really a a a I'll say a unique
[1:03:25] combination when we can find and we need
[1:03:28] that we need that believe me even in
[1:03:31] this last week as I spent time alone
[1:03:34] with God I'm so conscious that you know
[1:03:37] we're unworthy people
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; we're unworthy servants we we need the
[1:03:43] cleansing all the time
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; we need the grace of God every day.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; We just can't live one day without the
[1:03:51] grace of God being extended to us. We
[1:03:54] absolutely are in dire need of the grace
[1:03:57] of God. And I'm glad so glad that we
[1:04:00] don't have to do anything to earn it
[1:04:02] because if we if we had some penance or
[1:04:05] we had some some activity that we did to
[1:04:08] try to earn it no more. It would be no
[1:04:10] more grace. I'm just glad that God gives
[1:04:13] a grace.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; By grace he gives us what we have need
[1:04:16] of. And then the prophet in the message
[1:04:18] my redeemer liveth
[1:04:21] he said he walked different Jacob did
[1:04:24] what he used to walk because one night
[1:04:27] he came in contact with an angel of God
[1:04:30] and the angel touched his hip and made
[1:04:33] him walk different. He had and here's
[1:04:37] what I want you to uh register please.
[1:04:40] He had an evidence that he had been a
[1:04:45] hold of God and God had been a hold of
[1:04:49] him.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; He had a different walk.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; And I trust we all have experienced
[1:04:55] that.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; And if we have not say, "God, make my
[1:04:58] walk different."
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; I look down this congregation and I know
[1:05:02] the lives of many of you and I know that
[1:05:05] you got a hold of God. And I know that
[1:05:08] God got a hold of you because something
[1:05:11] happened and you were a changed
[1:05:13] creature.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The things I used to do, I
[1:05:17] do them no more. Not because we had some
[1:05:20] reformation, because we had a
[1:05:23] transformation.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Listen to your testimony, Sister Lana. I
[1:05:29] and my wife, and we're so blessed to
[1:05:31] hear it again and to hear things we
[1:05:33] hadn't heard before. And this is what
[1:05:35] they're producing. some from the
[1:05:37] congregation right here. It's called Our
[1:05:39] Stories and it's wonderful. You want to
[1:05:42] get the DVD of Sister Lana's testimony
[1:05:45] and what God brought her from and how
[1:05:47] God preserved how God preserved you, how
[1:05:50] God brought you to this place. It's
[1:05:52] nothing but the grace of almighty God
[1:05:55] that God would even open your eyes. Look
[1:05:57] where you came from and where you are
[1:06:00] today. And many of you have been here
[1:06:02] many many years in the grace of God and
[1:06:05] the peace of God and the preservation of
[1:06:08] God.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; You know where this message has come
[1:06:16] from?
[1:06:19] It's come from a prayer
[1:06:22] that I've been praying
[1:06:27] sometime. I would like to be able to
[1:06:30] I wish I could show the people on a
[1:06:33] screen
[1:06:35] how I see the enemy sweep in
[1:06:39] and attempt to destroy lives and cut
[1:06:41] them down.
[1:06:44] Attempt to destroy families and cut them
[1:06:47] down.
[1:06:49] Attempt to destroy ministries not only
[1:06:52] here but elsewhere and cut them down
[1:06:54] mercilessly.
[1:06:58] And I haven't had I haven't had a lot of
[1:07:01] words,
[1:07:02] but I have I want to say to this
[1:07:05] assembly as your brother,
[1:07:09] I've just prayed one thing. Preserve us.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Preserve us, oh God.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Preserve us in these violent times.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Preserve us in these wicked times. Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Preserve us from this temptation.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; That's why it meant so much to me,
[1:07:32] brother Jake,
[1:07:36] standing in the hospital room
[1:07:39] with the body of Sister Mina on the bed
[1:07:42] and just Brother Jake alone early in the
[1:07:44] morning and my wife and I went there and
[1:07:48] he began to tell me. He said she was not
[1:07:51] very responsive. She was
[1:07:54] sitting in her chair at home and he said
[1:07:58] her hand was just moving like this on on
[1:08:00] the arm of the chair.
[1:08:04] And he said,
[1:08:06] "This is the other part of the story,
[1:08:08] Brother Jake. This is your part and I'll
[1:08:10] tell you my part."
[1:08:13] He said, "What are you doing?"
[1:08:18] She said, "She's writing."
[1:08:21] What are you writing?
[1:08:24] Lead us not into temptation, but deliver
[1:08:27] us from evil.
[1:08:29] And I had been praying just over the
[1:08:32] last days
[1:08:35] when I see the enemy sweep in and he
[1:08:38] wants to cut people down. He wants to
[1:08:40] destroy. He wants to shatter lives. He'd
[1:08:43] like to just shatter everything.
[1:08:47] I just said, "God,
[1:08:50] preserve us.
[1:08:52] Preserve us." And then you hear a little
[1:08:54] rumor, you know, because I'm kind of the
[1:08:56] center
[1:08:58] control where central where everything
[1:09:01] comes through. You hear about this young
[1:09:03] person, you hear about that family, you
[1:09:05] hear about this fellow, hear about that
[1:09:06] man, hear about this woman, hear about
[1:09:08] them.
[1:09:12] He just gets so he can't hardly carry
[1:09:14] anymore.
[1:09:16] I only look up and say, "Preserve us.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Preserve us, oh God.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Preserve our young people.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Preserve our families.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Preserve our congregations.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Preserve our ministry. Preserve us. Oh
[1:09:31] God, can you say that with me? Preserve
[1:09:34] us."
[1:09:39] And I went to the scripture
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; and I read about Jacob
[1:09:47] says, "And I saw God
[1:09:50] face to face
[1:09:52] and my life is preserved."
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; I said, "Father, that's exactly it. in
[1:10:01] this day and in this age, my my mind
[1:10:03] went immediately to the message of this
[1:10:05] hour. And knowing that this was the this
[1:10:08] is the age of his presence. This is the
[1:10:11] age of his countenance. This is the age
[1:10:13] of his. And if we haven't seen it, it's
[1:10:15] our problem. Then we need to say, God,
[1:10:18] clear my vision.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Clear my eyesight. Take the veil away.
[1:10:24] Remove the dimness from me. Take the
[1:10:26] shades away that I might see you clearly
[1:10:29] because I know by your word. I know by
[1:10:32] the message of the hour. This is the day
[1:10:34] of your presence. This is the day of
[1:10:37] your visitation. This is the day when
[1:10:39] you're here to look and I can see you
[1:10:41] face to face. Amen.
[1:10:45] [Music]
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; If you don't see them, it's not a
[1:10:54] failure on God's part.
[1:10:57] It might be that our expectation is not
[1:11:00] where it should be. It might be where
[1:11:01] our focus
[1:11:04] is not where it should be.
[1:11:07] And so he said that Jacob from that
[1:11:10] moment had the time, had the evidence
[1:11:12] that he'd been a hold of God and God had
[1:11:14] been a hold of him, had gotten a hold of
[1:11:16] him. And he says when he was getting
[1:11:19] ready to die down in Egypt,
[1:11:23] he said with that inspiration before the
[1:11:25] resurrection,
[1:11:28] give him a a measure before the
[1:11:30] resurrection said, I know that
[1:11:32] something's going to happen yonder.
[1:11:35] a promised land in the promised land one
[1:11:38] of these days. So upon the the very
[1:11:41] place that this inspiration
[1:11:45] he said come here my boy Joseph
[1:11:48] that was a prophet his prophet come here
[1:11:51] my son Joseph
[1:11:54] which was a prophet he said come here
[1:11:57] and lay your hand
[1:12:00] on this wrestled the place where I have
[1:12:05] been. So now he's years later he's
[1:12:09] taking his son Joseph said lay your hand
[1:12:12] still remembering this is the evidence I
[1:12:15] have my life has been changed my life
[1:12:18] been transformed I still remember that I
[1:12:21] go back to that place that's a good
[1:12:22] thing to do and he said Joseph lay your
[1:12:24] hand right here on this place and swear
[1:12:28] to me by the God of heaven that you will
[1:12:30] not bury me down here swear that you
[1:12:33] won't bury me here for he knew that was
[1:12:36] essential that he was gathered with his
[1:12:39] people. He knew that he must be gathered
[1:12:42] with his people and I must not be buried
[1:12:44] here in Egypt. And so they took his
[1:12:46] bones and put them. He said, "My life is
[1:12:49] preserved." Now
[1:12:51] taking an important turning an important
[1:12:53] corner here in the message. My life is
[1:12:56] preserved.
[1:12:58] Jacob's life
[1:13:01] not according to his material things
[1:13:04] but his life according to the blessing
[1:13:08] and according to the promise. His life
[1:13:10] was preserved.
[1:13:14] When you think of what your life is
[1:13:19] and if I asked you to
[1:13:24] tell me what really comprises your life.
[1:13:33] Probably the most of it would be
[1:13:35] something that would be and I want to
[1:13:37] use two words tangible
[1:13:39] and intangible.
[1:13:44] visible and invisible,
[1:13:49] seen, material, physical
[1:13:52] and immaterial,
[1:13:55] invisible
[1:13:56] and unseen.
[1:13:59] And if I asked you to say to me, tell me
[1:14:03] what really makes up your life.
[1:14:12] You might have a whole range of things.
[1:14:14] You might say, "Well,
[1:14:18] uh, the love of my family,
[1:14:23] the special relationship that I have
[1:14:26] with this,
[1:14:28] my husband, my wife, or my family, my
[1:14:32] children.
[1:14:37] What makes up my life is the experiences
[1:14:39] I've had with God
[1:14:42] that have brought me to this place to
[1:14:44] where I am now.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; All of those are intangible.
[1:14:51] All of those are very very difficult to
[1:14:54] define because you can't put your hand
[1:14:58] on them. something that's tangible. If
[1:15:01] you look up the word, it is something
[1:15:03] that you can touch. And intangible is
[1:15:07] something that you cannot touch. You
[1:15:09] can't lay your hand on it.
[1:15:12] I began to think about our spiritual
[1:15:16] life
[1:15:18] and and uh what really makes up our
[1:15:21] spiritual life.
[1:15:24] And uh
[1:15:27] most of the things in the scripture
[1:15:31] have reference to in our a believer's
[1:15:35] life is largely the unseen.
[1:15:39] Now brother Brandham talks about the
[1:15:42] senses the senses of the body. He said
[1:15:45] and you've been given these five senses
[1:15:49] to contact this world. So you have them.
[1:15:53] He did something interesting as well. He
[1:15:56] picked a man out of the congregation.
[1:15:58] Said, "Now here's a man. He's in a gray
[1:16:01] suit. He's got a striped tie on."
[1:16:05] He said, "It's a little larger than
[1:16:07] myself."
[1:16:08] He said, "Now, uh, I can't touch that
[1:16:12] man. I'm I I'm not able to touch him,
[1:16:16] but he says, but my sight declares him."
[1:16:20] So I have a sense that declares him. I'm
[1:16:24] looking at brother Ernie just now. So my
[1:16:26] sight declares him even though my touch
[1:16:30] does not declare him. My other senses
[1:16:33] don't declare him but my sight declares
[1:16:36] him. Then he moved and he says now my
[1:16:39] sight doesn't declare him but I still
[1:16:41] know that he's there.
[1:16:44] My sight doesn't declare him. Now now
[1:16:46] there's no he can't touch him. He can't
[1:16:49] see him. He can't hear him. Doesn't
[1:16:52] smell him. Doesn't taste him. None of
[1:16:54] the senses declare that he's there. But
[1:16:57] he says, "But I know that he's there."
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; And that's how faith is.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; These senses were not made to contact
[1:17:07] the supernatural.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; They're not made for it. Oh, I felt it.
[1:17:11] Well, that's that's fine. Happy you felt
[1:17:13] it, but it wasn't it's not what we're
[1:17:15] talking about.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I heard I heard a voice. I heard. I
[1:17:19] saw a flash of light. Fine. Too many
[1:17:22] people put their anchor their faith on
[1:17:25] that. That's not faith. It's what you
[1:17:28] don't see, what you don't hear, what you
[1:17:31] don't smell, you don't taste. The body's
[1:17:34] not affected by it whatsoever, but you
[1:17:36] know it's there.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; How do you know? Well, I wrestled.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; I had a great wrestle.
[1:17:47] I'd been trained in a certain way. I I
[1:17:49] believed a certain thing and I had a
[1:17:53] wrestle with a man uh with the angel of
[1:17:56] God and it left me with a different
[1:17:59] walk. I was changed from that moment. I
[1:18:02] got up out of that place and I was a
[1:18:04] different person from then on. I've had
[1:18:07] lots of struggles. I've had lots of
[1:18:08] battles. But I was changed.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Every person needs that. Every man and
[1:18:16] woman needs that. Every young person
[1:18:19] needs that. If you haven't had that
[1:18:21] meeting, you need to meet that angel of
[1:18:24] the Lord.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Who is it? It's the angel of the
[1:18:26] covenant. You need to meet Revelation
[1:18:29] 10:1. You need to meet him. You need to
[1:18:32] meet him in his power and in his
[1:18:34] holiness and in his presence. Oh, you
[1:18:37] say, "How will I know that I met him?"
[1:18:39] You won't be able to shake it off. You
[1:18:42] won't be able not to know. Do you hear
[1:18:44] me? You won't be able not to know.
[1:18:46] You'll meet him and you'll be
[1:18:48] transformed.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; And seeing Sister Lana's testimony
[1:19:01] really spoke to me because I was right
[1:19:03] on the on the line of this in my
[1:19:05] message.
[1:19:07] When God begins to deal with you,
[1:19:11] I don't care where you're at. I don't
[1:19:12] care what your position. You can be in
[1:19:14] in hell's darkest hole,
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; but when God begins to deal with you and
[1:19:20] he begins to put things in your mind,
[1:19:22] you can't get rid of those things for
[1:19:24] nothing. They're just with you all the
[1:19:26] time. You can be in in a you can be in
[1:19:29] the darkest place on earth. You can be
[1:19:31] in the deepest of of sins of of sin's
[1:19:35] blackness, but you cannot get that off
[1:19:37] your mind. That's all you think about.
[1:19:40] You just think about it. and you can't
[1:19:42] shake it off because God's dealing with
[1:19:44] you. Then when you finally surrender and
[1:19:47] give in, when you finally lay it all
[1:19:49] down, oh my, how glorious it is. It's a
[1:19:52] birth and it's a mess.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I like to see births that are a mess.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; I like to see people wallow in their
[1:19:59] tears. I like to see them repent. Oh,
[1:20:02] you say, "Well, a lot of people have
[1:20:04] tears, but they don't they don't really
[1:20:06] come to Christ." That is true. A lot of
[1:20:08] people repent for a whole lot of reasons
[1:20:10] and I'm not going to go into it.
[1:20:13] You want me to?
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; People repent because they get caught.
[1:20:16] People are cry because they get caught.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; That's not repentance.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; People cry because they they they've
[1:20:25] tried something else and doesn't work.
[1:20:26] Woohoo. It doesn't work.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; So that's your problem.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not being difficult. But when a man
[1:20:33] the the scripture says that it is the
[1:20:36] goodness of God. There's two scriptures
[1:20:39] that I always stand on. The goodness of
[1:20:41] God leads a man to repentance.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And godly sorrow
[1:20:49] workketh repentance.
[1:20:51] Godly sorrow. We're sorry for our sin.
[1:20:56] We're sorry for our mistakes. We're
[1:20:58] sorry for our unbelief. That's why I
[1:21:00] don't have much of well if I hurt you
[1:21:02] that's not the thing. If I offended you
[1:21:05] that's not a repentance. It's say I did
[1:21:07] wrong and I'm sorry for it. I said
[1:21:11] something and God has spoken to me and
[1:21:13] I'm sorry for it. I should not have said
[1:21:16] that. I should not have done that.
[1:21:18] That's repentance.
[1:21:24] So we have now the visible and the
[1:21:26] invisible, the seen and the unseen, the
[1:21:28] tangible and the intangible things. And
[1:21:31] I can tell you that Jacob became a very
[1:21:35] very great man in the in his time. And
[1:21:40] he had thousands of cattle and thousands
[1:21:42] of flocks of sheep and goats and camels
[1:21:46] and
[1:21:47] herds of animals and so on. He had
[1:21:50] children. He had his wives with him and
[1:21:53] servants and all of these things. You
[1:21:56] will not find any place in the scripture
[1:22:00] where he's contriving
[1:22:02] to gain. Well, you say, "Well, what
[1:22:04] about when he was working for Laban?"
[1:22:07] Listen, he tells Laban when he meets
[1:22:09] him, Laban follows after him, chases
[1:22:11] him, and catches him. I think seven days
[1:22:13] journey or so. They had already left
[1:22:15] three days and he finally caught him and
[1:22:18] said, "Why did you take my gods?" etc.
[1:22:20] And they search for everything. Can't
[1:22:21] find the gods. It was Rachel that had
[1:22:23] taken one of her father's gods and hid
[1:22:25] it. But anyway,
[1:22:28] uh Jacob says to Laban, he said, "I
[1:22:32] served you." He says, "What do you mean?
[1:22:34] You know that these are your cattle and
[1:22:36] everything I have is yours." He said, "I
[1:22:38] served you so many years for my wives. I
[1:22:42] served you." He said, "And you changed
[1:22:43] my wages 10 times." And and and and the
[1:22:47] the cattle that I was to receive, they
[1:22:50] were if they were a a scrubby one and a
[1:22:52] sickly one, that's what I got. And then
[1:22:57] and then if they were string raaked or
[1:22:59] or whatever, marked a certain way, he
[1:23:01] got all the marked cattle. And and and
[1:23:04] then God told them how to put the rods
[1:23:07] in front of the the eyes of the animals
[1:23:10] while they were while they were
[1:23:12] conceiving. And and here the cattle came
[1:23:15] and they were all marked and they were
[1:23:17] odd kind of oddball cattle and that all
[1:23:19] became his. And anytime one of Jacob's
[1:23:23] one of Laban's cattle was sick and died,
[1:23:26] he made Laban he made Jacob replace it.
[1:23:29] Anything that was torn by animals and
[1:23:32] killed, he made Jacob replace it. And so
[1:23:36] Jacob, Jacob's
[1:23:38] focus and his thrust in life was not to
[1:23:41] attain.
[1:23:43] I'm laying a big foundation here, but
[1:23:46] his focus in life was not to better
[1:23:48] himself in life. God just did it.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; In fact is whatever God wants to do,
[1:23:56] he'll just do it. As long as we have our
[1:23:59] correct perspective, as long as we have
[1:24:02] our correct focus, as long as we have
[1:24:06] God's spiritual agenda, then we leave
[1:24:09] everything else. Sometimes, you know, we
[1:24:12] tend to look upon another say, "Oh my,
[1:24:14] why are they blessed? Oh, why? What do
[1:24:16] they do? What what do they do? How come
[1:24:18] they're doing so well?" That has nothing
[1:24:20] to do with that. You got your eyes on
[1:24:21] the wrong thing.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Your eyes need to be on one thing. is
[1:24:26] what is God's main purpose in this life?
[1:24:29] What is God's main agenda?
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Whether you say amen or not, I'm going
[1:24:37] to preach it.
[1:24:38] [Applause]
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying about Jacob is what I'm
[1:24:44] saying about us.
[1:24:46] Jacob's trouble
[1:24:49] only started after he got the birthight.
[1:24:53] That's where his trouble really started.
[1:24:55] And the birthright in its entirety
[1:25:00] is intangible
[1:25:03] completely.
[1:25:05] Something he can't define. It's just
[1:25:07] something out there.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Hey, you talk about your theophony. Show
[1:25:13] me your theophony.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; You talk about, oh, I go to prepare a
[1:25:18] place for you, and if I go to prepare a
[1:25:20] place for you, I'll come again and take
[1:25:21] you. I I got a home. Show me the home.
[1:25:23] Tell me the home. It's all intangible.
[1:25:28] You believe this message. Believe this
[1:25:30] word. Show me your faith. Show me your
[1:25:32] believing. Show it to me. So, well, you
[1:25:34] know what you're going to end up with?
[1:25:36] You're going to end up at the end of
[1:25:37] this service saying, "I can't really I
[1:25:39] can't really prove anything.
[1:25:42] I don't have anything tangible to lay my
[1:25:44] hand to and say, this is really what I
[1:25:46] believe." That's why people, you know,
[1:25:49] they like to take medals and idols and
[1:25:53] so on so forth. And that is why the even
[1:25:55] the children of Israel, that's why they
[1:25:58] said to Moses, you know,
[1:26:02] give us this calf.
[1:26:04] We want to we want to identify something
[1:26:07] and say, "These be the gods that brought
[1:26:10] you." We want to be able to lay our
[1:26:11] hands on something and say, "This is the
[1:26:14] blessing of God.
[1:26:18] I really come home this morning say how
[1:26:22] people come here in this church and I
[1:26:24] don't care what other people throughout
[1:26:26] the message think about this church is
[1:26:28] oh yeah big church worth millions of
[1:26:30] dollars blessing my goodness I don't
[1:26:33] even think about that when I come in
[1:26:34] this place I'm just glad glad we got a
[1:26:36] place to sit in and glad we got a place
[1:26:38] to worship glad I have people come
[1:26:41] around you know what I don't even take a
[1:26:43] lot of people around because I they get
[1:26:44] start googling
[1:26:47] Oh.
[1:26:49] Oh.
[1:26:50] And they see the big switchboards up
[1:26:52] there or whatever more. I don't even
[1:26:54] know. Some some people buy it. The
[1:26:56] trustees buy it or somebody says
[1:26:57] something. This is what we need. That's
[1:26:58] what we need. So they go ahead and get
[1:27:00] it. Say h how's it paid? I don't know.
[1:27:05] God gave somehow and the people gave and
[1:27:08] that's what happened. But somebody out
[1:27:10] there this this God's work.
[1:27:13] When the church was very very young,
[1:27:15] just a handful were there. My some of my
[1:27:18] own daughters came to me and they were
[1:27:19] all disturbed and troubled because it
[1:27:22] looked like some of the young people,
[1:27:23] one or two of them were slipping away. I
[1:27:26] said, "Dad, dad, you know, this is
[1:27:28] happening. Dad, dad," I said, "Hey,
[1:27:32] just a second.
[1:27:33] These are God's sheep, sir, and if he
[1:27:37] can't keep them, I sure can't."
[1:27:41] Well, this one's slipping away and that
[1:27:42] one's slipping away. I say, if God can't
[1:27:45] keep them, if they've been here,
[1:27:47] sometimes people been here and they hear
[1:27:50] the word, they've been here for years.
[1:27:52] They know exactly what the word of God
[1:27:53] says. They know exactly what the message
[1:27:55] says, but they're determined to go their
[1:27:57] own way.
[1:27:59] Up to them. Down the road is a lot of
[1:28:02] trouble.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Down the road is a lot of heartache. And
[1:28:05] the trouble is so many times years later
[1:28:07] they come back.
[1:28:11] The woman might be in the service this
[1:28:13] morning.
[1:28:17] Just about three weeks ago,
[1:28:20] I sat in my office
[1:28:23] with a woman
[1:28:27] and she took counsel from me
[1:28:31] 23 years ago.
[1:28:36] And I said, "Don't do it.
[1:28:40] Don't do it.
[1:28:43] It's wrong. It's against the word. It's
[1:28:46] against the message."
[1:28:50] But it was something that she felt she
[1:28:53] needed in her life. She would get a
[1:28:57] companion. She would get a home.
[1:29:02] And so she went and did it. It involved
[1:29:05] a marriage.
[1:29:09] About three weeks ago,
[1:29:13] she asked for a meeting,
[1:29:15] sat in my office,
[1:29:19] and her first word says, "I've been in
[1:29:22] the wilderness for 23 years.
[1:29:28] Can I come back?
[1:29:34] It's the only woman I ever put out of
[1:29:38] the church.
[1:29:41] Just can I come back?
[1:29:44] Have you repented? Oh, have I repented?
[1:29:48] 23 years. 23 years
[1:29:53] gone.
[1:29:55] Kind of a big vacant space.
[1:30:01] You know friends
[1:30:08] say so what is the problem brother Ed?
[1:30:10] The problem was got the vision on the
[1:30:14] physical on the natural and lost the
[1:30:18] vision on the spiritual.
[1:30:21] Where am I headed
[1:30:24] now? I want to come to another
[1:30:26] scripture. I want you to hold that right
[1:30:29] there, please.
[1:30:31] The scripture says, "While
[1:30:34] we look not at the things,
[1:30:38] While we look not at the things that are
[1:30:41] seen,
[1:30:45] While we look not at the things
[1:30:49] which are seen,
[1:30:52] but at the things which are not seen.
[1:30:55] For the things which are seen are
[1:30:58] temporal,
[1:30:59] but the things which are not seen are
[1:31:02] eternal.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Can I read that again?
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Would you like to turn in your Bible and
[1:31:09] read it with me?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Turn to second Corinthians the 4th
[1:31:13] chapter.
[1:31:24] 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter
[1:31:29] and it is verse 18.
[1:31:36] And let us read it together, shall we?
[1:31:39] While we look not at the things which
[1:31:41] are seen, but at the things which are
[1:31:44] not seen, for the things which are seen
[1:31:48] are temporal, but the things which are
[1:31:51] not seen are eternal. The key word here,
[1:31:56] the key word, and this is really where I
[1:31:59] want to focus the message
[1:32:02] is while we look. Look,
[1:32:06] that word is actually has two aspects to
[1:32:10] the word and I need to kind of
[1:32:13] demonstrate it for you.
[1:32:16] While we look not at the things which
[1:32:18] are seen and the and and and the word
[1:32:22] key, the word that is key here is this
[1:32:27] word look. And I just want to get I had
[1:32:30] it I have it here for you.
[1:32:37] It is to do this that we do not look to
[1:32:41] observe to fix one's eyes upon to direct
[1:32:46] one's attention to or having regard for
[1:32:50] a thing. In other words, and it also
[1:32:52] means to to to turn or to be separated
[1:32:56] from.
[1:32:58] So there's two things that happen here
[1:33:00] when we look say we look so we turn and
[1:33:05] we focus here and we look on a certain
[1:33:08] thing
[1:33:11] in order to do that
[1:33:13] we have to be we separate we essentially
[1:33:16] that's what the word is speaking of we
[1:33:18] actually separate while we turn because
[1:33:20] it assumes we are looking at something
[1:33:23] so while we look not so we look not to
[1:33:27] look said Look here. We So we we
[1:33:30] actually it's not just a change of
[1:33:32] direction, but it's actually a change of
[1:33:35] focus. What we were concentrating on
[1:33:38] here, what we were spending our energy
[1:33:41] on here, now we change the focus and we
[1:33:44] look over here. What Apostle Paul, he's
[1:33:47] not saying we're not in this world
[1:33:49] anymore. He's not saying we don't have
[1:33:50] bills to pay anymore. He's not saying we
[1:33:52] don't have a life to live and we don't
[1:33:54] have we don't have to make our way. He's
[1:33:56] not saying that. But what he's saying is
[1:33:58] that we don't focus on this. We don't
[1:34:00] look on this. In fact is he's saying be
[1:34:03] separate separated from that.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Because we can't be divided. And that's
[1:34:09] what Jesus said. We can't serve God and
[1:34:11] mammon. Can't serve them. Can't serve
[1:34:13] both. It doesn't say that mammon doesn't
[1:34:16] exist. Says we can't serve them.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; We can't be focused on them. That can't
[1:34:22] be our attention. That can't be what
[1:34:25] consumes us. That can't be what occupies
[1:34:28] us night and day. It can't be that. It
[1:34:31] has to be what is invisible.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; What does the invisible declare to you
[1:34:37] today?
[1:34:43] Where are you going to place the
[1:34:44] importance? If I understand what a
[1:34:46] prophet says, he says, "Right beside you
[1:34:48] is a theophony." Listen to me. You mean
[1:34:51] at the time of this short breath on
[1:34:53] life, we're going to take just a breath
[1:34:56] expire from here. People will weep maybe
[1:34:59] over our remains and you're going to be
[1:35:02] in another body.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we be focused on that?
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we be focused that if this
[1:35:09] body be dissolved, we have another in
[1:35:11] the heavens, eternal aonian.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why shouldn't that occupy
[1:35:16] us? Why shouldn't we be thinking about
[1:35:18] that? Why shouldn't we be thinking about
[1:35:20] where we're going? Not to spend 30, 40,
[1:35:23] 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years. Where we're
[1:35:25] going to spend eternity, where we're
[1:35:27] going to be at home, not where we're
[1:35:30] going to be with a few people here at
[1:35:31] Cloverdale Bible, but where we're going
[1:35:33] to be with the saints of old.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; You people have said to me, "Oh, you're
[1:35:37] so privileged. You say you were with the
[1:35:39] prophet of God. You were with brother
[1:35:40] Brandham." What happens if I tell you
[1:35:42] this morning? You're going to see him.
[1:35:44] You're going to be there. You're not
[1:35:46] going to be in a weakened body. You're
[1:35:48] not going to be struggling with life.
[1:35:50] You're not going to have weaknesses.
[1:35:52] You're going to be there. You're going
[1:35:53] to see the Lord Jesus. You're going to
[1:35:55] see the apostles. You're going to see
[1:35:57] the saints. You're going to see the
[1:35:59] martyrs. You're going to be with them
[1:36:01] forever.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't that be our focus? Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; And the things of life, the things that
[1:36:14] are natural, if we strain and we
[1:36:16] struggle and we want to get a little
[1:36:18] higher, we want to get I'm not saying
[1:36:20] don't pay your bills. I'm not saying
[1:36:21] don't don't appreciate your your raise
[1:36:25] or whatever happens or a better car you
[1:36:27] get or whatever more. That's not our
[1:36:29] focus.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; If it just so happens, if it happens,
[1:36:33] let it happen. If the camels increase,
[1:36:36] let them increase.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; If the house increases, let it increase.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Whatever happens, that's not our focus.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; It might go down.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; And I have a message coming on God's
[1:36:49] economy.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; And it'll be a startle to a lot of
[1:36:53] people.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; So what? say, "Oh, I had people come by
[1:37:02] my place years ago and said, "Your house
[1:37:05] is worth $90,000." Well, of course,
[1:37:08] that's a chuckle today cuz that's not
[1:37:09] even the price of a lot.
[1:37:12] And I think I think I had around 50
[1:37:15] 50,000 in the place that I built, 57,000
[1:37:19] or something. Says, "Oh, your place
[1:37:21] worth 90,000."
[1:37:23] Well, well, it's just a roof. I I got to
[1:37:26] live here. That was my realization. And
[1:37:27] I even told him maybe I put in my hands
[1:37:29] like spiritual Jews. I don't know. I
[1:37:31] said,
[1:37:34] "So it's worth 90,000." What? So what?
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; But I said, you know, and I I I had a
[1:37:40] realization if I if I sell it for 90, I
[1:37:43] got to pay 90 for some piece of junk
[1:37:45] across the road.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; So that's that's nothing. And they came
[1:37:49] back said, "Oh,
[1:37:53] your place's worth 130,000." So, so I
[1:37:57] still have to have a place to live.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; It doesn't do anything for me. And they
[1:38:02] come back and say, "Oh, it's gone down.
[1:38:04] It's only worth 110." So,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; and I finally decided a long time ago,
[1:38:11] I'm not the one who's setting the price.
[1:38:13] Some guys in the government or some
[1:38:14] economist or some who control inflation
[1:38:17] or the Federal Reserve Bank or whoever
[1:38:19] else and I don't care about them.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; So, oh, now you're worth this. Okay.
[1:38:25] now. Oh, the economy's busting. Now
[1:38:27] you're only worth this. You're broke.
[1:38:29] So, I'm still here.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; And it so happens that we got a whole
[1:38:34] another focus. I'm looking to the
[1:38:36] unseen.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Are you crazy? Yeah, I'm crazy. I'm
[1:38:40] looking to the unseen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; I see in the unseen realm.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; I got another sense. A real one
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; more than this feeling. I got another
[1:38:52] sense. more than my taste and more than
[1:38:55] my smelling and more than my hearing and
[1:38:58] more than my sight. I have another
[1:39:00] sense. It's called a sense of faith.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; And this word of God says that faith is
[1:39:06] substance.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is substance.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; I got my hand on it. I got my spiritual
[1:39:13] grip on it.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't change. You need your
[1:39:18] vision on that on that unseen, the
[1:39:21] intangible, the untouchable. You can't
[1:39:23] touch it. Thank God I can't touch it.
[1:39:26] And neither can the devil touch it.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; And the economists can't touch it. And
[1:39:36] the politicians can't touch it. And the
[1:39:38] religious order can't touch it. Nobody
[1:39:40] can touch it. It's a sacred secret
[1:39:42] between God and me and God and you.
[1:39:49] while we look not.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And for the congregation this morning
[1:39:54] and all that hear me,
[1:39:56] there's a great need in this Leodysian
[1:40:00] age and within the message to actually
[1:40:05] we've been plagued by something and what
[1:40:07] we're plagued by is trying to have a
[1:40:09] foot in both worlds.
[1:40:11] What we're plagued with is trying to
[1:40:13] hang on to the one while we're trying to
[1:40:14] see the other.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; What we're plagued with is a divi a
[1:40:18] division in our focus. We're here and
[1:40:20] then we're here.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; We're here and then we're here.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Doesn't work.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Just doesn't work. We got to have our
[1:40:28] focus on and and this isn't going to go
[1:40:30] away. The church will still be here for
[1:40:32] you to these seats will be here, Lord
[1:40:34] willing, next time you need them to come
[1:40:36] and sit in them. Your house will be
[1:40:38] there whatever more and God will see you
[1:40:40] through it.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Through the good times, through the bad
[1:40:44] times.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:56] Jacob was not striving and neither
[1:40:58] should we
[1:41:01] to increase his goats,
[1:41:03] increases sheep,
[1:41:06] increase his what?
[1:41:09] Let me tell you something, friends.
[1:41:13] There's people in this country, I got to
[1:41:16] handhold myself back a wee bit. There's
[1:41:18] people in this country when I was a
[1:41:22] uh just a young we were young family
[1:41:26] and are they come in with a grand
[1:41:28] announcement. This is a this is a smart
[1:41:30] people. This is the smart people.
[1:41:34] The grand announcement.
[1:41:36] Can I tell you just a little personal
[1:41:38] things?
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Does it help you?
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; The smart people. The people are in
[1:41:43] control of thing. I'm we're not in
[1:41:44] control. People are in control of
[1:41:46] things. said, "We're going to allow you
[1:41:49] to put a little money away every year,
[1:41:53] and this will be for your retirement."
[1:41:57] Oh, it sounds so good. Retirement. I
[1:42:00] think a lot about that these days.
[1:42:03] Retirement.
[1:42:05] So, they let you put a little away and
[1:42:07] you don't have to pay tax on it. Oh,
[1:42:10] that is so my the government is so nice.
[1:42:14] Thank you for thinking of me. so kindly.
[1:42:18] So we put the money away and then the
[1:42:22] next year you put a little more away and
[1:42:24] the next year a little more and then
[1:42:26] finally things, you know, they go like
[1:42:28] this in the world up and down and in and
[1:42:30] out and back and forth. And then when
[1:42:32] you're done, you get to be my age and
[1:42:34] you find out what you put away.
[1:42:38] Won't even keep you in an old folks home
[1:42:39] for the next 12 months.
[1:42:45] just won't keep you. And here they've
[1:42:47] been enticing you all these years.
[1:42:51] Let me tell you another one.
[1:42:55] They take take off your salary. Take off
[1:42:58] your I'm talking about the things that
[1:42:59] we've been focused on. They take off
[1:43:02] your salary. It's called in Canada CPP,
[1:43:05] Canadian Pension Plan.
[1:43:12] and they take it off every every
[1:43:14] paycheck every year. I've put into it
[1:43:18] all my life. I started working when I
[1:43:19] was 15 before they even had it. And then
[1:43:23] as soon as they instituted, I've been
[1:43:25] paying ever since because I never see
[1:43:26] it. They take it off. It's yours, but
[1:43:29] they take it to look after it for you
[1:43:31] cuz you can't look after it. You're too
[1:43:33] dumb.
[1:43:36] We, the smart guys, we'll look after it.
[1:43:40] So they look after it and then God
[1:43:43] blesses me with health. And when I'm
[1:43:46] supposed to retire, I still I don't want
[1:43:47] to retire. I keep working. So I just
[1:43:50] keep going. They say, "Oh, you're still
[1:43:52] working. You can't have this."
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Well, who's going to have it? Oh, we're
[1:43:59] Never mind. Don't ask those questions.
[1:44:03] We're going to keep it.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; You are? Yeah.
[1:44:08] can't see a penny of it. And then you
[1:44:12] know what they said? Oh, you reached a
[1:44:14] certain age
[1:44:16] and uh we're going to send you a check.
[1:44:19] Well, the check right now wouldn't even
[1:44:21] buy gas for my car.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; And then they decided they learned, "Oh,
[1:44:26] you're still working. We're going to
[1:44:28] take that check back, too." And it's
[1:44:31] called grabbing back.
[1:44:36] You know what?
[1:44:38] I have a philosophy.
[1:44:41] So what?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; They never gave me my health in the
[1:44:46] first place. They never gave me
[1:44:48] salvation in the first place. They never
[1:44:50] gave me the promises of God in the first
[1:44:52] place. I got the promises of God which
[1:44:54] are far more. And so they tell you one
[1:44:56] time, "Oh, this is a oh, this is a
[1:44:58] wonderful thing." Don't have your eye on
[1:45:00] it.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't count on it being wonderful
[1:45:03] cuz I guarantee you the direction the
[1:45:05] world is going is not going to be not to
[1:45:07] treat you like
[1:45:09] like you're a special child.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; No, they won't.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Now that'll have you nice and silent.
[1:45:21] That's just kind of an introduction to
[1:45:23] God's economy. God has an economy also.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; God has an economy also. Do you believe
[1:45:31] that?
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; You know where I learned some of my
[1:45:34] lessons?
[1:45:37] The old brother from Portland, Oregon,
[1:45:40] he and his wife, which took I and my
[1:45:42] wife, they saw something in us. I don't
[1:45:44] know what they saw, but they saw
[1:45:46] something in us and invited us. They
[1:45:48] said, you know, they they felt that I
[1:45:50] should be in the ministry. So, they
[1:45:52] opened the door and we went before we
[1:45:54] had any children. My wife became
[1:45:57] pregnant carrying Linda while we were in
[1:45:59] meetings
[1:46:01] and we had to go back so that she'd be
[1:46:03] born. My wife was carrying a second
[1:46:06] child, Marilyn, while we were in
[1:46:08] meetings. And we were in meetings night
[1:46:10] after night after night. And then we had
[1:46:12] to go all the way back 1500 miles so the
[1:46:15] child could be born. This was our life
[1:46:18] at that time.
[1:46:21] And we were staying with them in a
[1:46:23] little wee tiny house. And he bought
[1:46:25] this. He bought this as a shack,
[1:46:28] one-bedroom shack. And he says, "I want
[1:46:30] to build on to it." He had a gift to do
[1:46:32] things in a special way. He said, "I
[1:46:34] want to build on to it." And and he had
[1:46:37] told me, he said, "Ed,"
[1:46:40] he said, "I have brothers and they
[1:46:43] worked their fingers to the bone. One is
[1:46:46] gold mining in Alaska. Another one is
[1:46:49] over in Yakama. and they spend their
[1:46:52] time working their fingers to the bone
[1:46:54] to increase and to get wealth and so on
[1:46:56] so forth. He says, "And I have as much
[1:46:58] as any of them have and spent his whole
[1:47:00] life preaching the gospel."
[1:47:03] Spending his whole life and I saw the
[1:47:06] man make incredible sacrifices
[1:47:08] and refuse and turn down lucrative
[1:47:11] lucrative things. They asked him to
[1:47:14] build the the the monument arch over
[1:47:18] President Roosevelt's where his son was
[1:47:21] killed, their only son in the state of
[1:47:24] Alaska on a in a plane crash. And they
[1:47:27] said, "We've built a we built a road
[1:47:29] about 60 miles." He says, "I'm too busy
[1:47:31] preaching to the native Indian people."
[1:47:34] He said, "No, you don't understand." He
[1:47:36] said, "We don't care what you charge. We
[1:47:39] build a road 60 miles. charge anything
[1:47:42] you want. We've looked at several pieces
[1:47:44] of stonework and we want you to do it.
[1:47:47] He said, "Well, I can't do it. I'll go
[1:47:49] and have a look at it and tell you how
[1:47:50] it should be." So, he drove out with
[1:47:52] them and he says, "This is the way you
[1:47:53] have the arch and this is what should
[1:47:55] be." He designed the whole thing, you
[1:47:56] know, said this way, you know, and and
[1:47:58] and then he said, "Well, you're going to
[1:48:00] do it, aren't you?" "No, I'm not going
[1:48:01] to do it."
[1:48:03] Said, "We don't care what you charge.
[1:48:07] Name your price. we want you to do it.
[1:48:11] He said, "No, I won't do it. I'm too
[1:48:13] busy."
[1:48:15] I learned things from that man.
[1:48:19] I learned that he was seeing
[1:48:22] something else.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; And so I helped him in this shack in
[1:48:28] this house. And I'll never forget,
[1:48:31] excuse me for being so personal today,
[1:48:33] but I'll never forget he had the power
[1:48:35] saw laying at his feet, standing right
[1:48:38] out in front of this wall. We got a
[1:48:39] bunch of builders and carpenters here.
[1:48:41] None of you like this fellow.
[1:48:43] He said, you know, he said, "We want to
[1:48:45] build this room out from here," he said.
[1:48:47] And he picked up that saw and he he
[1:48:48] looked the corner of the wall and he
[1:48:50] said, "I think we should cut in right
[1:48:51] about here." And he just buzzed right up
[1:48:54] that cut the whole front end of his
[1:48:56] house out. And I, my dad was a
[1:48:59] carpenter. I thought, "Wow, you know,
[1:49:02] there's something else." He's just
[1:49:03] cutting right in right into his home.
[1:49:06] Cutting the whole wall out with no
[1:49:08] measurement, no line, no nothing. He
[1:49:09] just going up the wall, cut the whole
[1:49:11] wall out, fixed up this beautiful room
[1:49:14] and he built a fireplace in it and I was
[1:49:16] helping and he just designed it and
[1:49:18] because it was cute, people fell in love
[1:49:19] with it. But this just a place where
[1:49:22] they could have between meetings, they
[1:49:23] had to have a place, a roof over his
[1:49:25] head. He didn't care. it is no interest
[1:49:27] to him what it's worth. That had no he
[1:49:31] didn't know we're going to do it and
[1:49:32] make some money. That wasn't in his mind
[1:49:34] at all. We just need a roof over our
[1:49:35] head
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; so we can come back and be at home.
[1:49:40] And pretty soon knock on the door came.
[1:49:43] Says, "Where was the Department of
[1:49:44] Transport?"
[1:49:46] He's way out in the boondock south of
[1:49:48] Portland towards Tigert. He says, "And
[1:49:51] here come uh here come people from the
[1:49:55] Department of Transport." They said,
[1:49:56] "There's a big freeway coming from the
[1:49:58] I5 here, and it's cutting over here to
[1:50:01] Beaverton, and it's coming right through
[1:50:04] this area, and we need a big area for a
[1:50:08] freeway
[1:50:10] uh corridor, and it so happens that the
[1:50:13] corridor comes across the back of your
[1:50:15] property. If it didn't touch your house,
[1:50:18] then you'd be home free. Unfortunately,
[1:50:21] it just cuts the corner off your roof.
[1:50:25] Just a corner. It doesn't touch the
[1:50:26] building. It just the hangover of the
[1:50:28] roof and it just clips it. So they says,
[1:50:32] "So we have to buy the house from you."
[1:50:34] Says, "We don't want to sell the house.
[1:50:36] You have to. And then what we'll do is
[1:50:39] when we buy the house, you have to move
[1:50:41] out the property that is not used. We
[1:50:45] take the house and we sell it by auction
[1:50:48] and then the house will be moved by the
[1:50:51] person who buys it and you will have the
[1:50:54] remaining property
[1:50:57] and whatever we don't have and haven't
[1:50:59] taken from you, you will have that. So
[1:51:02] fine, it was a big hassle. So they oh we
[1:51:06] do we need this because it's in our way.
[1:51:08] He was so busy just wanting to have
[1:51:10] meetings, wanting to work for God.
[1:51:11] That's all his whole life was getting
[1:51:14] people saved. That was his whole
[1:51:16] ministry.
[1:51:18] So now they have to move out. They move
[1:51:20] out
[1:51:21] just go in a motor home or something and
[1:51:24] go to the auction to buy the house
[1:51:26] because they sent people there and he
[1:51:28] had all this stone big stone fireplace.
[1:51:30] So appraiser comes in says we don't know
[1:51:33] how to praise this place. How's anybody
[1:51:35] going to move all this stonework? They
[1:51:37] sent two other fellas. They come and
[1:51:39] look at it and the lady next door wasn't
[1:51:42] even getting enough to pay her mortgage.
[1:51:44] They weren't getting anything. Here's a
[1:51:46] man who's giving his whole life. Has no
[1:51:48] focus, no attention on natural things
[1:51:51] whatsoever.
[1:51:52] None. Zero.
[1:51:54] Believe me, I spent some years living
[1:51:56] with them and learned some things,
[1:51:59] things I've never shared with you. I'm
[1:52:01] sharing this with you. And finally, they
[1:52:03] said, "We're going to give you 25,000
[1:52:06] for this house."
[1:52:08] and we'll sell it at the auction. So he
[1:52:10] gave him 25,000 cash, a lot of money
[1:52:14] back in the 1950s. Yes, sir.
[1:52:18] And he goes to the auction. He's sitting
[1:52:20] there. They'll wonder what they're going
[1:52:22] to get for this place because they can't
[1:52:24] move all this stone fireplace and stuff.
[1:52:27] He sits in the auction and buys the
[1:52:30] house for 800
[1:52:34] and went and got his stuff and moved
[1:52:36] back in because the land that they
[1:52:38] didn't need fell back to him and he
[1:52:41] stayed in the same house was just out
[1:52:42] for a few days and had 24,200 in his
[1:52:46] pocket. I say, "Praise God. I like that
[1:52:49] kind of economy." Now, did he figure
[1:52:52] that out? No, he never figured that out.
[1:52:54] God figured that out. Yes.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; But what was his vision on? His vision
[1:52:58] wasn't I'm going to do this. I'm going
[1:52:59] to make a big bunch of money and so on.
[1:53:01] That wasn't consuming him. He couldn't
[1:53:03] care less.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; You understand? Because there has to
[1:53:07] come a time. We turn from this. We turn
[1:53:10] from this apple. We turn from this and
[1:53:14] look over here. And what is over here?
[1:53:16] The invisible,
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; the unintable,
[1:53:20] the immaterial, the thing I can't touch
[1:53:23] but the thing I believe in. And my
[1:53:25] faith, which God loves,
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; touches that.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; My faith lays a hold of that.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; That is my eternal purpose. That's my
[1:53:33] eternal home. That consumes me.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; That's what I think about when I get up.
[1:53:38] That's what I think about when I'm
[1:53:39] shaving in the morning. That's what I
[1:53:41] think about all my time is thinking
[1:53:43] about that.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; But Satan's got this life engineered to
[1:53:48] get your mind to captivate it on a whole
[1:53:51] bunch of other things. And at the end of
[1:53:53] the day, it's a waste.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; I really have an opposition to it
[1:54:02] because I see it. It just almost causes
[1:54:04] a person to become expire their strength
[1:54:07] and their energy and just become so
[1:54:10] weary struggling with the things of
[1:54:11] life. I tell you what to do. Turn away
[1:54:13] from it.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; I need to hear a bigger amen to that.
[1:54:19] Turn away from it. Amen.
[1:54:21] [Applause]
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; And you'll come to a rest.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; You'll come to a peace.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; It's not that we become dilatory. It's
[1:54:31] not that we become careless. God intends
[1:54:34] us to be careful stewards of what he
[1:54:37] gives us, but we're not striving or
[1:54:40] spending our time creating a larger herd
[1:54:42] or a larger bank account or this or that
[1:54:44] is. Just be diligent with what God gives
[1:54:46] you. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; If you're working for somebody, give him
[1:54:50] his time.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Be diligent. Be the best employee there
[1:54:54] is on the street. Be the most Be the
[1:54:57] most diligent person with financial
[1:55:00] matters. Just be diligent with the whole
[1:55:02] thing.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Just give me a couple more moments
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; because you may think, well, where's
[1:55:13] this in the message? This is pretty
[1:55:14] elementary. It's very important.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; The seals now came to be open.
[1:55:23] And I have to give you this before I
[1:55:25] close.
[1:55:27] The seals were about to be open. Now,
[1:55:29] here's the messenger on earth.
[1:55:32] A a prophet messenger 30 years
[1:55:37] looking into the invisible.
[1:55:42] Do you see that light? He couldn't
[1:55:44] believe that people couldn't see that
[1:55:45] light.
[1:55:49] I read this morning, he said, "I see
[1:55:51] you."
[1:55:53] He said, "Does anybody know this woman?"
[1:55:56] Some hands went up. He said, "Thank you.
[1:55:59] Are we strangers?" Total strangers.
[1:56:02] I said, "I see you. You be I see you
[1:56:04] becoming a young woman again.
[1:56:08] Where's he looking?" That's the only way
[1:56:11] he could help her. That's the only way
[1:56:14] she could get faith in her heart is by a
[1:56:17] prophet looking into the invisible and
[1:56:20] seeing. And now comes a time because all
[1:56:22] of the healing, all the supernatural,
[1:56:24] all the vindication isn't bringing a
[1:56:27] bride forth.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Thought you'd catch that.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; All of that, all that feeling, all of
[1:56:35] that, you sense the presence. You know
[1:56:38] you're not in the presence. Even that
[1:56:39] didn't bring a bride forth.
[1:56:43] How many people have you run into said,
[1:56:45] "Well, I stood in front of the prophet
[1:56:46] and I felt that incredible mighty
[1:56:48] presence and it just consumed me. It
[1:56:51] just it just changed my life." Do you
[1:56:54] ever meet one?
[1:56:57] Do you know why? Cuz that's not it.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Did they feel it? Yes, they felt it. Did
[1:57:03] they tremble? Yes, they trembled. Did
[1:57:05] they put their hand on the pulpit to
[1:57:07] steady themselves? Yes, they did. But
[1:57:09] did did it bring them to the word birth?
[1:57:11] No.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; And I don't know exactly why.
[1:57:16] Don't look. I say to this congregation,
[1:57:18] the name of the Lord, stop looking for
[1:57:21] the physical, supernatural, emotional.
[1:57:24] Stop living in an emotional realm.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I feel good. I don't feel good.
[1:57:30] That has nothing to do with it.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Your natural desires and your emotional
[1:57:35] things has nothing to do with the
[1:57:37] kingdom of God.
[1:57:44] And now God has a messenger says now I'm
[1:57:48] going to I'm going to open the seals.
[1:57:52] I'm going to open what's been in the
[1:57:55] bosom of God through this eternities
[1:58:02] and uh
[1:58:05] you you go and if you read if you will
[1:58:07] read
[1:58:10] Is this the time, sir? Is this the time
[1:58:12] of the end, sir? And Junior Jackson has
[1:58:15] a dream. And he interprets the dream.
[1:58:18] And he says, I was standing and he asked
[1:58:20] Juny, calls him Juny, said, "Didn't I I
[1:58:23] I had my hand up there and I I I took
[1:58:26] something like a bar or something
[1:58:28] sharp." Yeah, that's right. And and
[1:58:30] cleaved off the top of this mountain.
[1:58:32] Yeah, that's right. And it was white
[1:58:35] stone. There was stone there and things
[1:58:37] were written in the stone. But the sun,
[1:58:39] not the su n, but the s o n had never
[1:58:42] shone on that. It was written. There's
[1:58:45] mysteries, secrets, things that had been
[1:58:47] who made the mountains. God raised them
[1:58:49] up. What is this all referring to? It's
[1:58:52] referring to the opening of the word.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; And there was things that were written
[1:58:56] there. And no man had ever seen this.
[1:58:59] The sun had never shone on it. He says,
[1:59:01] "And I was to interpret this to the
[1:59:03] brethren to the brothers and there was a
[1:59:05] bunch of ministers around." He said,
[1:59:08] "And and and
[1:59:10] the the one that was with him said to
[1:59:12] him as a prophet messenger, look on
[1:59:15] this."
[1:59:16] He says, "And I said to the ministers
[1:59:19] that were standing around me, look on
[1:59:22] this." And then I left and went and I go
[1:59:25] over a hill, down a valley, over a hill,
[1:59:27] down valley, and begin to go west, which
[1:59:30] is what he did.
[1:59:31] came to Arizona. I was going west,
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; he says. And then the ministers, some
[1:59:36] went this way, some went that way, some
[1:59:39] went another way, and very few stayed
[1:59:43] and looked on what I said.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; The looking was the key to everything in
[1:59:53] the future.
[1:59:55] And those that went this way and went
[1:59:57] that way did so because they had other
[2:00:00] things they got attached to and failed
[2:00:03] to stay and look on what he said.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; And then he comes comes actually to the
[2:00:12] opening of the seals and in the seventh
[2:00:14] seal he comes all the way back and
[2:00:17] details and relates that whole thing
[2:00:20] again.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. and told the people, "Look on this
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; at the end."
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Are you catching what
[2:00:30] I'm saying? Look on this.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Don't figure it out. Just look on it.
[2:00:36] Amen.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; And then the first seal was opened and a
[2:00:43] horse rider, a living creature, a horse
[2:00:46] rider rode out, but a living creature, a
[2:00:50] living,
[2:00:52] it was called a beast. The beast said,
[2:00:54] but there's two different I want to
[2:00:55] won't have time to get into it now, but
[2:00:58] the the beast was a living creature. The
[2:01:00] prophet said it was an anointing that
[2:01:02] came down in every age. And he said,
[2:01:06] "And the beast said, the seal was
[2:01:09] opened, and the living creature cried
[2:01:13] out, come and see."
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Those are two things. And if you look
[2:01:22] carefully now, just for a moment, and
[2:01:25] I'm winding up. If you look carefully at
[2:01:27] every move of God
[2:01:31] for Moses
[2:01:33] or say for the Lord Jesus,
[2:01:36] the first part of his ministry
[2:01:39] was a ministry that caused people to
[2:01:42] come
[2:01:44] to come and they came and it attracted
[2:01:48] the people. And the prophet said in the
[2:01:51] ministry which was the revealing of
[2:01:52] Jesus Christ for 30 years the ministry
[2:01:56] attracted the people. The signs
[2:01:59] attracted the people. The wonders
[2:02:01] attracted the people. So what did they
[2:02:03] do? They all came.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Thousands came. Hundreds of thousands
[2:02:08] into the millions came. Then come
[2:02:11] another part of the ministry which was
[2:02:13] the unveiling
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; of the God that was speaking.
[2:02:19] Notice, notice, please carefully. Well,
[2:02:22] I'm just trying to close up. Moses comes
[2:02:25] down to the people. I'm on the same
[2:02:27] thought. Moses comes down to the people
[2:02:30] said, "I met God in a burning bush." A
[2:02:33] supernatural thing. I met him in a
[2:02:35] burning bush and this is what he said
[2:02:37] and now I'm down here.
[2:02:39] He said, "Who is he?" Says, "I am that I
[2:02:41] am."
[2:02:44] And Moses then begins to manifest this
[2:02:47] one in the invisible, intangible,
[2:02:51] immaterial God that spoke to him in a
[2:02:54] voice. And to prove that he met this God
[2:02:58] and this God had called and spoke to
[2:03:00] him, to prove it, plagues begin to come.
[2:03:04] When the plagues came, something the
[2:03:06] people could touch and feel and
[2:03:09] understand, something that affected them
[2:03:11] physically, they began to see it. And
[2:03:13] then they would respond to Moses, "Go
[2:03:16] and tell your God, take it away, and
[2:03:18] we'll let the people go."
[2:03:22] And God would hear and take it away. But
[2:03:24] the people the people to them it had a
[2:03:29] it had a compelling power and attracted
[2:03:33] them
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; to come.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; You might wonder maybe why the woman
[2:03:39] didn't continue to walk out of the
[2:03:41] wheelchair. I tell you what that
[2:03:43] happened or they had a bigger crowd
[2:03:45] there. A bigger crowd of what?
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; A bigger crowd of who?
[2:03:54] You understand?
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; And here come the big crowds and some
[2:03:58] more plagues and some more plagues. 10
[2:04:01] plagues. And those people were
[2:04:03] completely in alignment with Moses.
[2:04:07] Moses is our man. Oh, Moses is this
[2:04:11] great prophet.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; They're going to hear Moses. They only
[2:04:15] got into the wilderness a short distance
[2:04:17] and they forgot all about him.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; And we don't even know what happened to
[2:04:21] this Moses. They went up in the
[2:04:22] mountain. They've been 400 years in
[2:04:24] bondage. Not not willing to wait 40
[2:04:27] days.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; I find that is still a human weakness
[2:04:31] today. Person can live a life and be
[2:04:34] before the people all the years and then
[2:04:36] some maybe some infraction maybe not
[2:04:38] some infraction but some disappointment
[2:04:40] said well I'm disappointed.
[2:04:43] And so the people became disappointed in
[2:04:45] Moses for whatever reason but they had
[2:04:48] come out. They had come out. Watch
[2:04:51] closely. They came out. They did the
[2:04:54] coming uh being attracted to that first
[2:04:58] part. Come
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; and see.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; And then Moses met God and came down.
[2:05:06] And for the first time when he spoke the
[2:05:09] word, they could now see who it was.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt have no
[2:05:18] other gods before me. And he begins to
[2:05:20] lay the word down. Now they had God
[2:05:23] defined in word form
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; and they couldn't take it.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; The plagues call them to come. But when
[2:05:34] they saw God,
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; the Bible says they all died in the
[2:05:39] wilderness.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Read it. Read it in your Bible. Read it.
[2:05:46] And Jesus, he healed and took the fever
[2:05:49] away and raised the dead. And they came
[2:05:51] by the thousands and tore off their
[2:05:53] clothes and wave laid them down and
[2:05:56] waved, "Hosana
[2:05:59] in the highest.
[2:06:01] Hosana."
[2:06:03] One week before they were crying,
[2:06:05] crucify, crucify, crucify.
[2:06:08] What happens? People are fickle
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; if they don't have a real revelation.
[2:06:12] Really fickle. Amen. Amen.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Are they not? Do you understand what I'm
[2:06:17] saying?
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; That's why I say when a person has a
[2:06:21] birth and gets their eyes fixed on the
[2:06:24] supernatural, on the invisible, on the
[2:06:27] intangible, they're unmovable.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're unmovable.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; And here comes brother Brandham.
[2:06:41] 30 years, not three and a half as Jesus
[2:06:45] 30 years
[2:06:49] in front of the people, in front of
[2:06:51] mostly the Pentecostal people. As
[2:06:53] brother Brandham said, you received me
[2:06:57] and you receive the supernatural. They
[2:06:59] were made for it and the great signs and
[2:07:02] wonders that were done and they are to
[2:07:04] attend the church. It's not that they're
[2:07:06] not supposed to. They're they are too
[2:07:07] attentive. But that's what their focus
[2:07:09] was. What they could see, what they
[2:07:12] could feel, what could happen. And they
[2:07:14] wanted they wanted to see these things
[2:07:16] take place. And oh, they were did they
[2:07:19] glorify God? They glorified God.
[2:07:22] And then God begins to send his word.
[2:07:25] Come and see.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; God now begins to define himself in a
[2:07:30] thus sayith the Lord in a word. And the
[2:07:34] people now for the first time begin to
[2:07:36] see who it was that was with the
[2:07:38] prophet. And when they saw who it was,
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; they went their way.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; They went to their business. They went
[2:07:48] back to their cattle. They went back to
[2:07:49] the full gospel businessmen. They went
[2:07:51] back to their churches. They went back
[2:07:52] and look where they are today.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; And you never saw that. You never were
[2:07:58] in those meetings. You have tapes, but
[2:08:00] you didn't see maybe what I saw. That's
[2:08:02] why I feel it's a double blessing for me
[2:08:04] to be able to be here. I saw it and I'm
[2:08:06] still here.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; You never saw it and you're here.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; He in his grace, oh, made himself known
[2:08:14] to you. He in his grace showed himself
[2:08:17] to you and here you are.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; And I say to you in the name of the
[2:08:22] Lord,
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; let your vision pierce the veil.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Let your vision look to the unseen.
[2:08:30] Hallelujah.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; I just can't I can't really go on any
[2:08:34] further. I have so much so much here I
[2:08:36] would like to say, but I would I'd like
[2:08:38] to tell you that this messenger
[2:08:42] that is the one thing I'm so endeared to
[2:08:45] and he said that same God,
[2:08:49] that same God that was back there is
[2:08:52] actually present with you now. Oh, if I
[2:08:56] could get you to believe that.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; If I could get you to believe that,
[2:08:59] there wouldn't be a sick person in this
[2:09:01] place.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Not that that's our focus, but we desire
[2:09:05] those things. We desire the
[2:09:07] supernatural. Satan has no right
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; to God's children.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; You're sick here and afflicted. It's
[2:09:16] your right to be free from that.
[2:09:22] You've not had this experience with God.
[2:09:25] It's your right.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; It's your right to have it.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; You're here and you have not had a real
[2:09:32] light turning on of revelation within
[2:09:34] you. I'm not here to try to preach you
[2:09:36] into it. I'm just here to tell you it's
[2:09:38] your right.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Now, I come against Satan in the name of
[2:09:44] Jesus Christ. Something has plagued you.
[2:09:47] Some blindness has blinded you. It's
[2:09:49] your right to have vision.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. It's your
[2:09:55] right to look into the invisible.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; It's your right to have faith.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Faith belongs to you. It's your right
[2:10:05] more so than your feeling of your hand.
[2:10:07] It's your right to have that kind of
[2:10:09] touch.
[2:10:10] [Applause]
[2:10:14] And the prophet said, if we don't walk
[2:10:17] in light, if we only walk in, he said,
[2:10:19] if we don't walk in light, we'll become
[2:10:21] children of darkness.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; God, let us walk in light.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; The light of the word that has come.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; I give all praise and glory to God who
[2:10:30] has brought this message. I shall not be
[2:10:32] ashamed of this word.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; It has brought you to where you are
[2:10:37] today. I say glory to God.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; For having called you and brought you
[2:10:43] into his light.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; You didn't only come, but now you see.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; All glory to God.
[2:11:09] I've seen God face to face
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; and my life is preserved.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; My life is preserved.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; What was preserved?
[2:11:25] What was preserved
[2:11:27] when Jacob met him? What was preserved
[2:11:31] was the fact, listen closely, that he
[2:11:35] became within the lineage
[2:11:39] of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Satan was trying to rob him of the
[2:11:45] privilege.
[2:11:51] Listen to me friends. This world,
[2:11:55] this world would try to entice you
[2:11:58] for the single purpose of consuming you.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; This world would try to entice you with
[2:12:03] the good things of this age and the
[2:12:06] beautiful things of this age. You try to
[2:12:08] entice you until you be completely
[2:12:10] consumed and that is your whole focus
[2:12:12] and that that just becomes your energy
[2:12:15] is spent on that. And at the same time,
[2:12:18] God from another realm is speaking to us
[2:12:21] and showing us what it is he given. Here
[2:12:24] it is. And he's laying it out for us.
[2:12:26] He's giving it as simply as he can.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:34] I have an ambition in life.
[2:12:39] And I'll tell you, I can tell you my
[2:12:40] ambition. My life is close to being I'm
[2:12:43] in the twilight years.
[2:12:47] You may wonder why I am I am obsessed
[2:12:54] with getting the message into somebody
[2:12:56] else's hands.
[2:13:00] I feel a great coolness even amongst
[2:13:02] believers
[2:13:06] on that subject
[2:13:08] because they're content. I have it. And
[2:13:10] this is what I I'm in the bride.
[2:13:14] There's only God's grace here in the
[2:13:16] bride.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Nothing good that you have done. And by
[2:13:19] bringing you in, God laid the
[2:13:21] responsibility on you to try and give it
[2:13:23] to somebody else.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Show it to somebody else. Manifest this
[2:13:27] Christ to somebody else. Manifest this
[2:13:29] revelation to somebody else.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm obsessed.
[2:13:35] I sit at home as I did this week
[2:13:40] and I run across and I'm reading the
[2:13:42] message
[2:13:44] looking to the unsane. Looking at the
[2:13:46] unseen
[2:13:50] and I'm just so moved. I said, "My wife,
[2:13:53] let me read this to you. Isn't that
[2:13:54] beautiful?
[2:13:56] Isn't that beautiful?" And right away I
[2:13:59] get stung.
[2:14:01] What if somebody else wants to read
[2:14:02] that?
[2:14:04] What if somebody else that hasn't got
[2:14:06] that
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; right
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; needs that?
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; What can you do? And I feel that's where
[2:14:13] we need to use our energies and our
[2:14:15] resources.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Will I ever see that person? Maybe never
[2:14:18] see that person. Maybe never shake hands
[2:14:20] with that person. But I look to the
[2:14:22] unseen. One day, one day I tell you, I'm
[2:14:27] going to take a I'm going to take a
[2:14:29] journey, too. One day I'm going to take
[2:14:31] a step into my theophony. One day I'm
[2:14:35] going to be more than theophony. I'm
[2:14:36] going to be in a glorified body. You'll
[2:14:39] be in a glorified body. And let that
[2:14:41] body be more real than the one you're
[2:14:43] sitting in today.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; That's the promise of God's word. If I
[2:14:48] try to think of it with my mind, it's
[2:14:50] too too impossible.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; It just seems so far out of reach. The
[2:14:56] only way I can do it is with what he
[2:14:58] said. Right.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; And by getting it into someone else's
[2:15:06] language, I just think right away
[2:15:08] someone else can read that
[2:15:10] and see those same words and have that
[2:15:13] same effect on them. I see where that
[2:15:16] word has helped me through big battles,
[2:15:20] through big struggles.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; See where Satan tries to come in and
[2:15:24] just tear everything out from under you.
[2:15:34] I'll share one more very very precious
[2:15:36] moment with you.
[2:15:41] I may have shared it with this
[2:15:42] congregation. I don't know.
[2:15:45] Back in the log church,
[2:15:53] we were going through one of our darkest
[2:15:55] moments.
[2:15:58] It seemed that all the powers of
[2:16:01] darkness and Satan came against us.
[2:16:05] Came against me personally as well.
[2:16:09] And just as you walked in through the
[2:16:11] double doors, there was a door right
[2:16:12] here where the where the tapes had been
[2:16:16] cleaned.
[2:16:19] It was a nursery first and then we made
[2:16:22] it a room where the tapes were being
[2:16:24] filtered, brother Bren. And what was
[2:16:27] that for? Try to get it so someone else
[2:16:30] could hear it. Try to just get some get
[2:16:32] some tapes out. Get some cassettes out.
[2:16:35] Do whatever you could do.
[2:16:38] And I went into that room
[2:16:41] and I fell to my knees
[2:16:43] and I sobbed. You say you you sobbed,
[2:16:47] Brother Ed? Yeah, I did. I sobbed like
[2:16:50] my whole inside had broken like a
[2:16:53] fountain.
[2:16:55] And I cried out to God.
[2:17:00] And God spoke to my heart. No voice,
[2:17:04] nothing audible, but as clear as I'm
[2:17:07] speaking to you.
[2:17:11] Says, "Like David,
[2:17:15] I have given you peace.
[2:17:18] and you have walked with my prophet.
[2:17:23] Those two things.
[2:17:28] I've had ministers come and say,
[2:17:30] "Brother Ed,
[2:17:32] we look at your church
[2:17:35] and we see its stability."
[2:17:39] I move very quickly to back away
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; from taking any credit.
[2:17:47] Zero.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; There's no talent,
[2:17:52] no smarts, no nothing.
[2:17:56] Not my ministry, nothing.
[2:17:59] I go immediately back
[2:18:02] to that chair.
[2:18:05] I've given you peace.
[2:18:08] And I face those times.
[2:18:12] Every time I face them, not too often,
[2:18:15] but every time I do. Why am I saying
[2:18:17] this to you? You maybe didn't kneel at
[2:18:19] that chair, but you've knelt someplace.
[2:18:23] God spoke to you someplace. God talked
[2:18:26] to you somewhere. And I'm encouraging
[2:18:29] you, you go back as Jacob did, saying to
[2:18:32] his grown son, who's now a great great
[2:18:35] ruler, saying, "Put your hand at this
[2:18:38] spot where I met God, where I wrestled
[2:18:42] it out with God." That's what I say to
[2:18:45] you. And whenever I face it, I go back
[2:18:49] to that moment. And that's I read for
[2:18:51] you this morning, Jacob. Here he's
[2:18:53] coming. got his brother and a host of
[2:18:56] men, armies of men, 400 of them. He
[2:19:00] doesn't know what's going to happen, but
[2:19:01] he begins to tell God, "God, this is
[2:19:04] what you said."
[2:19:06] What's he doing? He's looking to the
[2:19:08] invisible.
[2:19:10] He's not looking at all the things that
[2:19:11] are around him. And I'm saying to the
[2:19:14] congregation this morning, we've got a
[2:19:16] we've got a a a a major battle on in
[2:19:20] Leodysia.
[2:19:21] This is a day of sights and sounds and
[2:19:25] feelings, feeling good, medications,
[2:19:29] everything, uppers and downers and this
[2:19:32] and that. Don't be hurt. Don't feel bad.
[2:19:36] Are you depressed? We got things to look
[2:19:38] after you. We got things to fix you.
[2:19:40] That's this world. We got a new color.
[2:19:43] We got a new taste. We got a new design.
[2:19:46] There's a new pickup truck coming out.
[2:19:48] There's a new this. There's a new that.
[2:19:50] I say don't have your eyes on that.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:54] [Music]
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; And let your faith and your philosophy
[2:20:03] be.
[2:20:09] Whatever he chooses for me
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; will be fine.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for your
[2:20:21] patience. Thank you for your time. Thank
[2:20:24] you for listening to me. And I pray that
[2:20:27] it'll be a blessing to you in the name
[2:20:29] of Jesus Christ. I trust you'll come to
[2:20:33] know him.
[2:20:36] Not lifting myself up, but I trust
[2:20:38] you'll come to know him as I have known
[2:20:39] him.
[2:20:41] When I speak to you and I become
[2:20:43] touched, it's because I've met him. I've
[2:20:46] heard him. I've heard his voice. I tell
[2:20:50] you, children, it works.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; it works. Do you remember where he met
[2:20:54] you? Do you remember where he first
[2:20:57] spoke to you?
[2:20:59] Don't forget about going back to it,
[2:21:01] reminding him. That's when you delivered
[2:21:03] me.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; That's when you set me free. That's when
[2:21:07] you spoke to my heart. That's when you
[2:21:09] told me to do a certain thing and I did
[2:21:10] it.
[2:21:14] Amen. I've seen God face to face and my
[2:21:18] life is preserved.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray.
[2:21:27] How we love you, Lord.
[2:21:30] How we love you, oh God. You're the God
[2:21:32] of Abraham,
[2:21:35] the God of Isaac,
[2:21:37] the God of Jacob.
[2:21:40] You are the one that
[2:21:43] they worshiped.
[2:21:45] Father, today as I've spoken very
[2:21:49] openly and very personally to this
[2:21:52] congregation,
[2:21:55] I pray, Father, especially for those
[2:21:58] that have not come to know you yet.
[2:22:02] May it be even now. May there be a
[2:22:05] strange and wonderful movement of around
[2:22:08] them. May they sense your presence,
[2:22:11] Lord. And for others that may not sense
[2:22:14] anything, may they simply say, "You have
[2:22:18] spoken it, oh God. You have said it in
[2:22:21] your word, and I want to follow it. I
[2:22:24] give myself to you." Lord, there's no
[2:22:26] service that we should end without
[2:22:28] giving opportunity to the people to say,
[2:22:31] "I am yours, Lord. I give myself to
[2:22:33] you." Right in the middle of my prayer,
[2:22:35] if that's you, then lift your hand. Let
[2:22:38] our eyes be closed and our hearts be in
[2:22:40] prayer. You lift your hand. Say, "Oh
[2:22:43] God, make yourself I need you to make
[2:22:45] yourself real to me." And I'm calling
[2:22:48] out to you right now. Don't depend on my
[2:22:50] prayer, but depend on your prayer.
[2:22:53] Depend on the promise of God. And
[2:22:55] heavenly father I pray through Jesus
[2:22:58] Christ the they the our redemption our
[2:23:01] redeemer. Lord even as you uh use Jacob
[2:23:05] in his own way and in his part you
[2:23:08] advanced you advanced and move forward
[2:23:11] the uh the coming of Christ uh in in in
[2:23:15] his visitation. And now in this time,
[2:23:18] Lord, you've even spoke through your
[2:23:20] messenger that we bring forth, we
[2:23:23] actually produce and bring forth the
[2:23:26] body of Jesus Christ in a bride form.
[2:23:29] Lord, I pray that you will take the word
[2:23:31] and the not only the sincerity but the
[2:23:34] seriousness of it. And may may our
[2:23:37] vision Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:23:41] let the vision of this congregation be
[2:23:45] fixed on the invisible Lord and on that
[2:23:48] which is beyond this world. For you've
[2:23:50] said in this you've said that the things
[2:23:52] of this world will pass away but those
[2:23:56] things oh God which you have made
[2:23:59] eternal they will be forever. In the
[2:24:02] name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I ask
[2:24:05] these blessings and believe for them.
[2:24:07] Lord,
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to have you stand and sing
[2:24:12] with me, Faith of Our Fathers, Living
[2:24:14] Still.
[2:24:26] I've got half a scripture I'll read.
[2:24:30] For we walk
[2:24:33] by faith,
[2:24:35] not by
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; That was written for us.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; We walk by faith.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; We walk by what we don't see.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; And not by sight.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; That's what Apostle Paul has said. All
[2:24:53] right, let's sing this song together.
[2:24:57] Faith of our father
[2:25:01] living
[2:25:02] still
[2:25:04] in fire
[2:25:08] and fire and sword.
[2:25:12] Oh, our hearts be high with joy.
[2:25:19] Where we hear that glorious
[2:25:25] word,
[2:25:27] fade of our father,
[2:25:32] [Applause]
[2:25:34] we will be true to the
[2:25:40] day. Our
[2:25:43] father's chain
[2:25:46] in prison
[2:25:48] dark
[2:25:50] where still and heart and conscious
[2:25:55] brea
[2:25:57] how sweet would be their children's
[2:26:03] faith
[2:26:05] if they like them could die for thee.
[2:26:12] Faith of our father.
[2:26:16] Holy
[2:26:18] faith.
[2:26:19] We will be true
[2:26:23] to thee till death.
[2:26:28] Faith of our father.
[2:26:31] We will love
[2:26:35] both friend and fool in all
[2:26:40] our strife
[2:26:42] and preaching
[2:26:46] as love knows how
[2:26:50] by kindly words
[2:26:53] and users.
[2:27:00] Holy
[2:27:03] faith
[2:27:05] we will be true to
[2:27:11] as your testimony faith on our father's
[2:27:17] holy
[2:27:19] name
[2:27:21] we will be true
[2:27:24] to the
[2:27:26] children.
[2:27:30] Why do you think Hebrews 11 is there in
[2:27:33] the scripture? It's there for you. It's
[2:27:36] there for me. By faith, Abraham, by
[2:27:40] faith, Sarah, by faith, Noah, by faith
[2:27:43] the patriarchs, by faith. That's what
[2:27:46] God recognized. And friends, it's not
[2:27:48] something you have to pull down. Faith
[2:27:50] is nigh thee.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Where? Even in thy mouth.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; The word of faith which we preach, it's
[2:27:57] not far away. this thing that I preach
[2:27:59] today, it's not don't become quiet. It's
[2:28:01] not something that's distant. It's I'm
[2:28:03] trying to tell you you possess it. You
[2:28:05] have it. You need to just exercise that.
[2:28:08] Hallelujah. And part of the exercising
[2:28:11] will be will be turning your focus from
[2:28:17] this
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; to this.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; And I want to say in closing, you can
[2:28:24] have both. That's why I use Jacob,
[2:28:26] please. I'm not preaching anymore, but I
[2:28:29] use Jacob as a testimony because a
[2:28:32] believer
[2:28:34] can have both the material
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; and his vision fixed on the unseen at
[2:28:41] the same time.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; And that is why
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; the scripture tells us of kings.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; David, he he he didn't write in his
[2:28:50] Psalms 10 and some books and chapters.
[2:28:54] He didn't write about his throne. He
[2:28:56] didn't write about the marble. He didn't
[2:28:58] write about the great columns and the
[2:29:00] great pillars and what more he wanted to
[2:29:02] do. He wrote about the covenant of God
[2:29:04] and wrote about the precepts and your
[2:29:07] word is life to me. That was all. What
[2:29:09] is it? He had he was connected to the
[2:29:11] intangible.
[2:29:14] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I
[2:29:16] pray that my time here this morning will
[2:29:18] not be in vain, but that there'll be a
[2:29:21] majority majority of this congregation
[2:29:24] that will say, "I'm fixing I'm fixing my
[2:29:28] vision from this to this." There was a
[2:29:32] whole portion of the Old Testament where
[2:29:34] exactly the same principle applies.
[2:29:36] Exactly the same principle applies.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:43] You got a life to live. You got bills to
[2:29:46] pay. I would I would advise you to take
[2:29:49] exactly what the old preacher said.
[2:29:52] God, you and I are in a deep dark hole.
[2:29:57] You get out, I'll hang on, and we'll
[2:29:59] both be out.
[2:30:01] Think that's good. That's good advice.
[2:30:04] That's good advice. And as sure as we're
[2:30:07] standing here, friends,
[2:30:10] you are going to cross over.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you. You are going to
[2:30:16] cross over.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; I am going to cross over. We might as
[2:30:22] well meet victoriously.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; We might as well go victoriously.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; We might as well go with our sights on
[2:30:30] the right goal.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[2:30:34] [Music]
[2:30:38] We're going to be there more real than
[2:30:40] we are right now.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; More real than we are right now. We are
[2:30:46] going to cross over and it won't be too
[2:30:48] long.
[2:30:50] And we're going to be on the other side
[2:30:53] either through the rapture or through
[2:30:54] and listen
[2:30:57] one last thing.
[2:30:59] When the opening of this word was coming
[2:31:02] and the opening of the seals was coming,
[2:31:05] the voice that spoke to him said, "This
[2:31:08] will bring rapturing
[2:31:12] faith."
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, I want to look on that,
[2:31:17] brother Gary.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; I want to be looking on that. I want to
[2:31:21] be looking on that, Nathan.
[2:31:24] Brothers and sisters, I want to keep my
[2:31:26] eyes on that.
[2:31:29] God bless you. We're going to pray now.
[2:31:34] Dear Father, I'm just asking as we
[2:31:37] close, as we dismiss,
[2:31:40] let this be a day when we ponder
[2:31:45] and think deeply about our lives,
[2:31:48] about what you'd have us to do, that we
[2:31:51] might follow very seriously,
[2:31:55] conscientiously.
[2:31:57] And Lord, in a consecrated way, the
[2:32:00] voice of the Holy Spirit, I pray that
[2:32:04] you'll direct the footsteps of these
[2:32:07] precious people. These are your
[2:32:08] children. You bought them with your own
[2:32:11] blood. I pray that oh God
[2:32:16] let them
[2:32:18] let us as a group of people be a true
[2:32:21] testimony
[2:32:23] be a true expression of the Lord Jesus
[2:32:26] Christ as he's revealed in this hour in
[2:32:29] Jesus Christ's name. Dismiss us now with
[2:32:32] your grace I pray
[2:32:34] for your glory. Amen. Amen. God bless
[2:32:39] you. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:32:44] You greet one another on this side.
[2:32:49] [Music]
[2:32:52] Lord willing, we'll see you on Wednesday
[2:32:53] evening. God bless you.
