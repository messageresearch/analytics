[20:09] Father, what a glorious atmosphere that
[20:12] we have here this morning with your
[20:14] presence amongst us.
[20:18] Father, we are so thankful that we have
[20:19] a place that we can come where your
[20:21] presence will be there to uplift us.
[20:25] Father, we are so thankful this morning
[20:27] that we have a God who hears and answer
[20:29] prayers.
[20:31] Father, you're not a God of stone, of
[20:33] wood, or or metal, of some kind of
[20:37] unanimated object,
[20:40] but you're the living God. Heavenly
[20:42] Father,
[20:44] you're the God of the resurrection.
[20:46] Father, you're the God of the living. Oh
[20:48] God, you're the God of the creation, of
[20:51] the heavens and the earth and the
[20:53] universe and all things and all there
[20:55] is. You are God of all things, Father.
[20:59] And there no things that are small are
[21:01] big in your sight, Father. All things
[21:04] are by you and for you and for your
[21:06] glory that were made this morning.
[21:10] We come before you with thanksgiving and
[21:12] with praise this morning, oh God,
[21:14] because you are the mighty God, the King
[21:17] of all kings and the Lord of all lords,
[21:20] and you're worthy of our praise this
[21:22] morning, the heavenly father.
[21:25] And out of the abundance and gratitudes
[21:28] of our hearts, Lord, we lift up our
[21:29] hearts with praise and adoration to a
[21:32] God who is more than deserving this
[21:35] morning. Father,
[21:38] &gt;&gt; who is like unto our God? For you are
[21:41] the almighty God, Father, and there is
[21:43] nothing impossible with you this
[21:45] morning.
[21:48] So we come with a request this morning.
[21:51] Heavenly Father, for each need that's
[21:54] been represented here this morning, oh
[21:56] God, you have an answer, Father, already
[21:59] delivered to meet that need, oh God. For
[22:02] you have given the answer through the
[22:05] sacrifice of your son Jesus Christ the
[22:08] resurrection.
[22:11] So this morning Lord we lay hands on
[22:13] this request and in the presence of the
[22:16] saints of the living God. Father we
[22:18] claim every need to be met in your
[22:20] divine presence.

[22:26] his wife in Africa. Father the pinched
[22:29] nerve. Lord we know how painful that
[22:32] situation can be. So we ask that Lord

[22:37] touch a sister and raise her up. Oh God,
[22:40] and heal her this morning. Father,
[22:43] we remember brother
[22:46] Rod's father in the hospital this
[22:48] morning. Oh God, we pray that Father,
[22:50] you will just do a great healing in his
[22:52] body. Oh God, we pray that oh Lord, the
[22:55] living cells in his body will come
[22:57] together, oh God, to give him a complete
[22:59] recovery this morning.
[23:03] Father, we remember that little one, oh
[23:05] God, with cancer, Lord. Oh God, what a
[23:08] devil. What a demon. Lord, we curse that
[23:12] thing in the name of Jesus Christ this

[23:17] the name of Jesus. Father, we pray you

[23:22] little one, oh God, and deliver it this
[23:25] morning for the glory of God. And for
[23:28] every other demon that is afflicting
[23:31] your people this morning, we curse them
[23:33] in the name of Jesus Christ. We put them
[23:36] at flight this morning with faith rising
[23:39] from your church this morning, Lord.
[23:43] Drive them away from your people, Lord.
[23:45] For we are the temple of the living God.
[23:48] And these bodies were made to worship
[23:51] you, Lord, to praise you, to glorify
[23:54] you, God. Oh father, we pray that Lord

[23:59] control this morning and deliver your
[24:02] people from everything that is troubling
[24:04] them.

[26:53] happy to have each and every one of you
[26:55] here and uh
[27:00] We're going to have a baby dedication at
[27:02] this time. Brother Alex and Sister Wina
[27:04] going to have their little one
[27:05] dedicated. If you could come at this
[27:07] time. Got a couple of announcements.
[27:10] Uh we want to welcome Rachel Joy Hoffer
[27:14] into the assembly. Uh brother David and
[27:17] Sister Natalie had a little girl 6 lb
[27:20] and 6 o 20 in long. born December the
[27:24] 9th, Thursday morning at 5:18
[27:29] a.m. It's early riser.
[27:32] And uh we want everyone to know as well
[27:37] uh that have children in the uh Bible
[27:40] way Christian Academy. There's a full
[27:42] practice for all of the children in the
[27:44] Bible way Christian Academy and all
[27:46] those who practice last Sunday evening.
[27:48] The children will eat their lunch in the
[27:50] fellowship room and the practice will
[27:52] start at 2:30 sharp this afternoon.
[27:56] Amen.
[27:58] Brother,
[28:02] how do we have a baby dedication without
[28:04] singing Jesus loves me?
[28:09] Jesus
[28:10] loves me. This I know.
[28:15] For the Bible tells me so
[28:24] long,
[28:26] they are weak, but he is strong.
[28:32] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[28:37] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[28:43] Yeah,
[28:44] Jesus loves me.
[28:54] I think that's a big revelation that we
[28:56] need to catch and realize from little
[28:58] children to
[29:01] old adults that Jesus loves me. This
[29:05] morning we have a baby dedication,
[29:07] Gideon.
[29:08] Lord,
[29:10] help me out.
[29:12] Yeah, I always say it one way and and
[29:14] they said, "No, you're saying it wrong."
[29:16] So, we'll say, "Little Gideon is being
[29:19] bapti baptized is being dedicated this
[29:21] morning." And I want you to uh think
[29:24] about a name, what a name is all about.
[29:28] Gideon,
[29:30] his father named him Gideon when he was
[29:32] born, and it means tree feller.
[29:37] And I thought that's that's incredible
[29:39] that his father would name him Gideon
[29:43] and call him tree feller.
[29:47] And he didn't happen to fall trees until
[29:49] the angel of the Lord came his way and
[29:52] he knocked down his father's groves.
[29:55] I thought that was incredible that he
[29:57] was given a name under prophecy of being
[30:00] a tree feller.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; But if you look it up also, it also
[30:04] means warrior.
[30:07] Gideon was a warrior. And I I I have had
[30:10] the privilege of of knowing brother Alex
[30:14] and sister Wakina as a brother and
[30:16] sister in Christ, a couple that love the
[30:20] Lord very much. Love this message.
[30:24] And I know the seriousness in which
[30:27] they've approached God to name their
[30:30] child. And I believe that as a
[30:32] believers, we all do that. Brother Bram
[30:36] said this. He says, 'Now, did you ever
[30:38] notice our young boys have become
[30:40] Ricky's and Elvis's?
[30:43] You got a child named that. He said,
[30:45] 'Cange it right quick. Name it number
[30:48] one or number two.
[30:53] Now that's horrible. Now this is what he
[30:55] says. That's horrible. You say, what
[30:58] difference does a name make? Why? It
[31:01] sure means everything. Your name
[31:05] characterizes your life.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; So I I I believe Brother Alex, Sister
[31:11] Wina, you've prayed before the Lord. You
[31:14] sought God and you named your child
[31:18] Gideon, a Woodfeller, a warrior.
[31:22] Brother Bram goes on to say now, he
[31:24] says, "Brother Brham, you're in
[31:25] numerology." No, I'm not. I'm on thus
[31:28] saith the Lord. So this is more than
[31:31] just a statement. This is the mind of
[31:33] God regarding naming your children.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; And I I thought it's tremendous that
[31:39] Gideon not only is mentioned in the
[31:41] under judges in the Old Testament, but
[31:44] in Hebrews, that chapter of faith, he is
[31:49] named in the scripture. And what shall I
[31:52] say more for the time would fail me to
[31:54] tell of Gideon?
[31:57] May Gideon be anointed under that name
[32:00] that his mother and father has given him
[32:04] to be a warrior for the kingdom of God.
[32:08] He was a brother Bram said he was a
[32:10] scriptural man and may Gideon be a
[32:13] scriptural man. If God should terry and
[32:16] he should grow up and he sees that his
[32:18] mom and dad are serving God with all
[32:21] their hearts. May he realize my parents
[32:24] are scriptural men and women. I want to
[32:27] be exactly a scriptural man. He says
[32:31] that's the kind that God comes to a
[32:34] scriptural man. May God anoint this
[32:37] little baby. May God watch over this
[32:39] little child and may he keep him under
[32:42] the wings of his of his protection.
[32:58] Lord, I cradle in my arms here this
[33:00] morning
[33:02] a bundle of joy and life that you've
[33:05] given brother Alex and Sister Wakina.
[33:09] Lord, they've desired that this young
[33:12] child would be dedicated this morning in
[33:14] the presence of God given back to you.
[33:18] They've waited on God to name this child
[33:21] and they've named it Gideon.
[33:24] And Father, I'm asking now that you will
[33:26] watch over this child. Keep it from all
[33:29] harm.
[33:31] Lord, set a wall around him. Give him
[33:35] such boldness as he would grow up, Lord,
[33:38] in the admonition of God.
[33:40] Lord, that he would be like a Gideon of
[33:42] old. That he'd be a warrior for the
[33:45] kingdom of God. that he would also be a
[33:47] contender against Baal, that he would
[33:50] stand for the standards of Jesus Christ,
[33:52] that he would hold the banner of your
[33:54] word up high, and that you will ever
[33:56] keep your hand upon this child. Make him
[33:59] a blessing in the home is my prayer.
[34:01] Lord, as a young age, may he thirst
[34:03] after thee, the living God. And Lord,
[34:06] may his joy be in Christ and Christ
[34:09] alone. Father, I just pray now that you
[34:12] will receive this little gift this
[34:14] morning as their mom and his mommy and
[34:17] daddy have now dedicated him back to you
[34:20] and pray God that you will take him and
[34:23] keep him in your perfect will is our
[34:26] prayer in Jesus name. Amen.
[34:30] Amen. The Lord
[34:52] We have a choir come and
[34:57] sing for us. Um song that uh want to we

[38:23] I give you my soul.
[38:28] I live for you alone.
[38:33] Every breath that I take,

[42:29] Have your way.
[42:33] Lord, I give you my heart.
[42:36] I give you my soul.
[42:41] I live for you alone.
[42:45] Every breath that I take,
[42:48] every moment I wait.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. Last phrase, have your
[43:01] way in me. Why don't we sing that chorus
[43:04] once again? Lord, I give you my heart.
[43:07] Lord, I give you my heart.
[43:11] I give you my soul.
[43:15] I live for you alone.
[43:20] Every breath that I take,
[43:23] every moment I
[43:28] have your way.
[43:34] I'd like the choir just to remain there
[43:35] just a moment. We're happy that you're
[43:38] all here. We're delighted for everyone
[43:41] that is part of our congregation this
[43:44] morning, the visible congregation, the
[43:46] invisible congregation, and I will say
[43:49] all those that may ever hear this
[43:52] service, may God bless them.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; May the presence of God be assembled
[43:59] with them, be in attendance with them
[44:02] wherever they may be. And especially
[44:04] today while we are
[44:08] uh connected,
[44:10] joined together hearttoheart, I like to
[44:13] say attribute to attribute because
[44:16] that's what every believer is is an
[44:18] attribute of God. We are just so happy
[44:21] to be uh a part of them. Uh, I would
[44:25] like to make mention that the Bible
[44:27] Waych Christian Academy has a Christmas
[44:30] presentation this Thursday and it is at
[44:34] uh 700 p.m. But we have very limited
[44:37] space. Uh, don't stay away because of
[44:40] that, but seating is limited. So, it'd
[44:44] be good for you to come early. And, uh,
[44:47] we're really thankful for the teachers
[44:50] which we have. We're thankful. I'm so
[44:53] delighted. I'm pleased that we have that
[44:58] number of children that uh between 60
[45:01] and 70 children that don't have to be
[45:04] exposed to that terrible environment in
[45:08] the world. Uh I I I would think that the
[45:11] congregation and everything that you
[45:12] contribute to it, I say God bless you.
[45:15] You might not know what you contribute,
[45:17] but the building is contributed. The
[45:19] premises is contributed and we like we
[45:22] we are just happy to have that part of
[45:25] it. Oh, it's a wonderful thing. We want
[45:27] to know that we give our young people
[45:29] and our children all the prayer support
[45:31] and all the support that we can in this
[45:34] time. You know, God is so gracious to
[45:37] us. I know that there was a a prayer
[45:40] request I believe by the Dertie family,
[45:43] but I just want to make mention uh
[45:46] Sister Geneva Dertie. Now, this just I'm
[45:50] going to rather than read it, I'm going
[45:51] to give it as I heard it. She was taking
[45:54] some she had some children with her and
[45:56] was taking them I believe uh home or
[46:00] whatever. And uh one of their sons
[46:04] uh
[46:06] Andrew, he had some pain in his in his
[46:09] stomach and pain in his internally and
[46:13] was just kind of complaining, not badly,
[46:15] but it was getting worse and worse, I I
[46:19] guess. And so anyway, she finally uh
[46:22] took him to the hospital to emergency
[46:25] and they uh sat there for about 2 and
[46:28] 1/2 hours, I believe it was. And you
[46:31] know, the medical system today isn't
[46:33] working very well. Uh it doesn't work
[46:37] very well on the state side. It doesn't
[46:39] work very well here. I've I've been in
[46:41] close contact with a lot of people
[46:43] suffering on both sides of the border,
[46:46] but you know, there's just more more
[46:48] sickness. There's more affliction.
[46:50] There's more diseases. There's more side
[46:52] effects from things that we've had. And
[46:54] sometimes the remedy is worse than the
[46:56] cause. And that's just the way it is.
[46:59] And so, Sister Geneva was waiting there
[47:01] a while and finally went up to the lady
[47:04] and said, "Our name hasn't been called."
[47:06] And she said, "Well, have you filled in
[47:08] these forms?" Well, no, I didn't haven't
[47:10] filled those in. Oh, she said, "You have
[47:13] to fill those in first." So, she filled
[47:15] those in and they finally got her in.
[47:17] And just as u as they finally got Andrew
[47:22] in, the doctor that was on duty was just
[47:25] getting ready to leave. And so, he's
[47:28] just going to check him over. Uh and uh
[47:32] he determined, well, there wasn't really
[47:34] anything
[47:35] uh seriously wrong and just let him go
[47:38] home. home and you know uh that was
[47:40] about all there was to it. But another
[47:43] doctor, a woman doctor had just come in
[47:46] to take this doctor's place and she
[47:48] said, "Well, let me check him over." So
[47:51] that doctor left. Now, this is why they
[47:53] had to wait all this time. See? And that
[47:56] doctor checked him over and said, "Take
[47:58] him to the sur emergency immediately cuz
[48:02] he's got a burst appendix."
[48:05] And he had a burst appendix. And the
[48:08] doctor who operated said it was a mess.
[48:11] Now you know, see, they had to wait till
[48:14] that other doctor was leaving and the
[48:17] new one was just coming. And it hadn't
[48:20] been that the boy might not be here this
[48:22] morning. So God does all things well and
[48:26] we're thankful for these testimonies
[48:28] that come by. Many times we don't know
[48:31] why we're going through what we're going
[48:33] through, but God sure knows why we're
[48:35] going through it. And so we're happy for
[48:37] the Dertie family.
[48:40] You know, I just wrote down while I was
[48:42] in prayer today where I was saying to
[48:44] the Lord, we're never needy till we're
[48:46] needy
[48:47] &gt;&gt; and then we're very needy. You know, our
[48:50] little boats go along the stream of life
[48:53] and everything seems to be going along
[48:55] nicely.
[48:58] But then when we hit rough water, you
[49:00] know, that's when we feel and realize
[49:03] our need is greater. And there are many
[49:06] people that are needy and some that may
[49:08] not even be here that are needy and we
[49:10] want to be compassionate. We just say,
[49:13] "Oh God, we want to see the hand of the
[49:16] Almighty." You know, we never need a
[49:18] miracle till we need a miracle. Then we
[49:20] really need one.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way it is? So let us be a
[49:25] believing people. I'd like to sing and
[49:28] have the choir. You can sing and help us
[49:31] in a real way. Let everybody in prayer
[49:36] say, "He came to me
[49:39] when I couldn't go to him. He came to
[49:41] me.
[49:42] I wasn't seeking for God, but he he was
[49:45] looking for me. He was looking for you
[49:48] and he found you and that's why you're
[49:51] here. That's why you believe what you
[49:53] believe because he came to you." Amen.
[49:57] Hallelujah. Let's just join in one
[49:59] unison, one unity. Let nothing be. Uh uh
[50:06] and and while I'm saying this, I would I
[50:08] would like to I would like to speak to
[50:12] the parents. Uh I've noticed that often
[50:15] times during the ministry of the word
[50:18] that there's far too much movement.
[50:22] Uh young people go out and I don't
[50:24] believe it's necessary.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a fairly senior man now and I
[50:30] don't have to leave the service. And I
[50:32] think that that our our people, mothers
[50:36] with young children and babies, that's
[50:38] one thing. But I think that we can sit
[50:40] and, you know, it's disrespectful
[50:43] when the word is being ministered, when
[50:45] prayer is being offered. It's a terrible
[50:48] disrespect. Just get up and solder out
[50:50] and go down the stairs or what. What is
[50:53] this? This isn't a game. This isn't a
[50:56] football game or a hockey game. This is
[50:58] God that we're we're coming into his
[51:01] presence and we want to maintain.
[51:03] Brother Brandham said so often, don't
[51:05] move around. Don't especially right at
[51:08] the time he was ministering to the
[51:10] afflicted and so on. Don't move because
[51:13] it was distracting and disturbing and
[51:15] you don't know who it disturbs. And I I
[51:17] have uh I'm sorry, but I've actually
[51:19] counted sometime over 40 to 50 going
[51:23] through the doors and that is absolutely
[51:27] unnecessary. I've been in crowds of
[51:30] hundreds and even thousands and you
[51:32] don't hardly see a soul get up and move.
[51:35] So unless it's an absolute emergency and
[51:37] want the parents to take responsibility
[51:39] for your children, you see them start
[51:41] getting up, you just grab them by the
[51:43] scuff of the neck, just sit right here.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; And if you're dying, we'll bring them to
[51:50] the front and we'll pray for them.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; You need to say amen to that. I believe
[52:00] that'd be pleasing to the Lord. We don't
[52:02] want anything to distract
[52:04] when the presence of God is amongst us.
[52:08] All right, let us sing it then. He came
[52:13] to me.
[52:17] He
[52:19] to me
[52:27] to where he was.
[52:30] He came to me.
[52:36] as I
[52:42] on
[52:49] my
[52:52] to
[52:58] have all of our sisters sing it.
[53:03] Lift it up to him now.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; When I
[53:14] come
[53:16] to anyone,
[53:19] he gave me.
[53:25] That's why I
[53:34] bless his holy name
[53:40] to
[53:43] he
[53:47] man.
[53:53] Oh, he came to me
[54:01] when I could come
[54:04] to where he was.
[54:07] He came to me.
[54:13] That's why he li
[54:18] on
[54:24] what I could not come
[54:28] to where he was. He came to me. Everyone
[54:34] all together now he came to me.
[54:40] Oh, worship him.
[54:44] to me.
[54:48] When I
[54:52] to
[55:10] praise the Lord I would come
[55:15] to where he was
[55:19] to me.
[55:25] Our heavenly father,
[55:28] our hearts are filled with gratitude
[55:32] and the mercy, the grace, the love that
[55:36] you've expressed towards us. I pray that
[55:39] you will now take supreme control and be
[55:43] the preeminent one. Be the honored one
[55:47] in the hearts of the people and praise
[55:50] coming out of the mouths of the people.
[55:52] Lord, we are here not to be seen, but
[55:56] we're here to meet with the living God.
[55:59] We're here to see your power manifested,
[56:03] your revelation upon our hearts and our
[56:05] minds. Lord, I pray that you'll take and
[56:08] anoint us each one that service has
[56:10] already been much prayer and worship.
[56:14] But we're asking once again just now as
[56:16] we stand at the post of duty. You will
[56:19] come to each one.
[56:22] Bless us together now in Jesus Christ's
[56:25] name and all those that are
[56:28] in their homes, in their rooms, wherever
[56:31] they might be. Lord, wonderful words
[56:34] that we've received from the people on
[56:37] the internet streaming in Switzerland
[56:40] and in Norway. Oh God, and New Zealand
[56:44] and America, North America, all over.
[56:47] Lord, how we thank you for these beloved
[56:50] saints of God.
[56:52] Bless us together now as we open your
[56:54] word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[56:58] Thank you, choir.
[57:01] If you'll open your Bible, please to
[57:03] First Peter. We're going to read a few
[57:05] verses.
[57:13] The scripture says of Jesus
[57:16] when they recorded his coming,
[57:19] John told us
[57:22] that he was full of grace.
[57:28] full of grace and truth. And I couldn't
[57:32] help but think in this in this
[57:34] generation
[57:36] when he came to us,
[57:38] he came full of grace. That's favor,
[57:41] full of favors,
[57:44] full of unmmerited
[57:46] favor. Full of
[57:49] &gt;&gt; And we are here today blessed people,
[57:52] full of grace and truth.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Full of truth. Not just a little shade
[57:58] of it here and there, but full of truth.
[58:00] What a mighty unveiling of the word of
[58:02] God in this day. Full of truth.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to read out of
[58:08] first Peter
[58:10] uh chapter 2 and starting at verse 20.
[58:19] For what glory is it if when you are
[58:21] buffeted for your faults, you shall take
[58:24] it patiently? But if when you do well
[58:28] and suffer for it, you take it
[58:30] patiently, that is acceptable with God.
[58:35] For even here unto where you called,
[58:38] because Christ also suffered for us,
[58:42] leaving us an example, that you should
[58:44] follow in his steps,
[58:47] who did no sin, neither was guile found
[58:50] in his mouth. Who when he was reviled,
[58:54] reviled not again. When he suffered, he
[58:58] threatened not, but committed himself to
[59:01] him that judgeth righteously.
[59:04] righteously,
[59:06] who his own self bear our sins in his
[59:09] own body on the tree, that we being dead
[59:13] to sins, should live unto righteousness,
[59:16] by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye
[59:20] were as
[59:23] sheep going astray, but are now returned
[59:26] unto the shepherd and bishop of your
[59:29] souls. God bless you. Thank you for
[59:31] standing. You may be seated.
[59:37] If you still have your Bibles open, I
[59:40] wish to
[59:43] speak out of uh the 21st verse.
[59:48] For even here unto were you called,
[59:52] because Christ also suffered for us,
[59:56] leaving us an example that you should
[59:59] follow his steps.
[1:00:03] I I want to speak on in his steps.
[1:00:07] There's two things that
[1:00:11] come to mind immediately
[1:00:14] when we speak about
[1:00:16] following in his steps. Two essentials.
[1:00:20] There must be one to lead,
[1:00:24] willing to lead, able to lead, and there
[1:00:28] must be
[1:00:30] one that will follow.
[1:00:33] Those are the two essentials.
[1:00:35] someone to lead and someone to follow.
[1:00:41] In the last last few services as we've
[1:00:45] been speaking,
[1:00:47] I did refer to some of these scriptures
[1:00:50] out of Exodus.
[1:00:52] But you know, this was a remarkable time
[1:00:54] and that's why it's referred to so much
[1:00:56] because God was now calling a nation out
[1:01:01] of a nation. And God had spoke to
[1:01:04] Abraham, who was the first man of
[1:01:06] promise.
[1:01:08] Your seed is going to remain in this
[1:01:09] land. They'll be there for 400 years.
[1:01:13] They're going to be they're going to
[1:01:15] suffer, but I'm going to deliver them
[1:01:17] with a mighty hand. And that's why it's
[1:01:20] a remarkable thing. But what? But now
[1:01:24] here, God began to lead them out.
[1:01:28] And they weren't always willing
[1:01:31] followers.
[1:01:32] when they weren't willing to follow,
[1:01:34] they ran into a good deal of trouble.
[1:01:38] And it says in the scripture, I'm going
[1:01:41] to read quite a number of scriptures.
[1:01:45] The Bible says, "And the Lord went
[1:01:47] before them." This is Exodus 13:21.
[1:01:50] "And the Lord went before them by day in
[1:01:54] a pillar of cloud to lead them the way."
[1:01:59] That was the purpose. to lead them the
[1:02:02] way and by night in a pillar of fire to
[1:02:06] give them light to go by day and by
[1:02:09] night. In Exodus 23rd chapter, then two
[1:02:13] verses 20 and 21, God spoke again to
[1:02:18] them says, "Behold, I send an angel
[1:02:21] before thee to keep thee in the way
[1:02:26] and to bring thee into the land which I
[1:02:29] have prepared." In other words, this is
[1:02:32] who it is, and I'm giving it to you. And
[1:02:37] this is the objective to bring you to a
[1:02:40] certain place. Now, that was back there
[1:02:43] and nothing has really changed. I have
[1:02:46] sent an angel to lead you
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; and to show you the way
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; and it's going to bring you to the place
[1:02:54] that I have intended for you to be. That
[1:02:57] was the plan of God. And then in Exodus
[1:03:02] 32, this was the chapter when we spoke
[1:03:05] on the blame game. This is a chapter I
[1:03:08] referred to because now the people, they
[1:03:12] start out by saying this Moses, this
[1:03:16] man,
[1:03:18] this man who was leading us, we don't
[1:03:22] know what's happened to him.
[1:03:25] They made a grave error
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; by not realizing and not recalling, not
[1:03:32] remembering. It wasn't a man that was
[1:03:34] leading them.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; This man that God gave us and to lead us
[1:03:41] out. We don't know what's become of him.
[1:03:44] He's this message has changed and the
[1:03:46] man has disappeared and he's up in the
[1:03:48] mountain someplace. We don't know what's
[1:03:51] happened to him. But God never did tell
[1:03:53] him, "I sent a man to lead you. I have
[1:03:56] sent an angel to lead you."
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; And the angel was the angel of the Lord.
[1:04:01] It was God himself that was leading
[1:04:04] them. And the man was a prophet who was
[1:04:07] able to transcend that dimension where
[1:04:12] God was. And he was the one who
[1:04:14] initially saw the pillar of fire.
[1:04:16] Whether the others saw it was in the
[1:04:18] sight of all of them. But the the key
[1:04:21] here is that it was the angel that was
[1:04:23] leading them.
[1:04:26] And when the people saw that Moses
[1:04:29] delayed
[1:04:31] to come down out of the mount, the
[1:04:32] people gathered themselves together unto
[1:04:35] Aaron, and said unto him, "Make us gods,
[1:04:41] which shall go before,
[1:04:44] and before is the face of
[1:04:47] panium, the face or the presence. make
[1:04:51] us gods who we who will be present with
[1:04:55] us who will who we can go who will go
[1:04:58] before us and we will be in the presence
[1:05:01] of them make us gods for us for as this
[1:05:04] Moses the man that brought us out of the
[1:05:09] land of Egypt we know not what has
[1:05:12] become of him this man that brought us
[1:05:15] out of Egypt can you imagine people
[1:05:19] being reduced to to that place. Not just
[1:05:22] one or two, not just one or two, but the
[1:05:25] whole company of the people all rose up.
[1:05:28] You know, it was a it was a mass error.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how this mass of of people
[1:05:36] can become influenced and they they
[1:05:39] they're swayed one way and a few days
[1:05:41] later they're swayed another way. It's
[1:05:43] it's fickle. Politics is fickle.
[1:05:47] Popularity is fickle. All of this fame
[1:05:50] is fickle. If you're if you're a gold
[1:05:53] medal winner, you're oh, you're you're
[1:05:56] almost a god or a goddess. But if you
[1:05:58] come in second, you're just nothing.
[1:06:00] They don't even know your name. And the
[1:06:02] next year or the 6 months down the road,
[1:06:05] you're replaced or displaced by someone
[1:06:07] else and you're just not even in the
[1:06:09] picture anymore because it's just a
[1:06:12] fickle thing. And religion is fickle.
[1:06:15] something is all you know just a whole
[1:06:18] sweep and we've had all of these sweeps
[1:06:21] who had you know uh
[1:06:24] oh uh the promiseke keepers
[1:06:29] you don't hardly hear of it anymore but
[1:06:31] there's have tens of thousands people
[1:06:33] get all excited because it's a big mass
[1:06:36] hysteria that gets going
[1:06:40] bumper stickers by the thousands I found
[1:06:43] it That's true.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; You saw them. No doubt. I found it. And
[1:06:48] the unbelieving, you know, it became a
[1:06:50] laughter. They know what did you find?
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; You know, what did you find? It was, you
[1:06:54] know, like they thought it would be a
[1:06:56] kind of a religious catchphrase. And,
[1:06:58] you know, they were going to, you know,
[1:07:00] I found I found it. I found Jesus or I
[1:07:02] found something. I don't know what it
[1:07:04] was, but the whole thing just became a
[1:07:05] mass hysteria and the bumper stickers
[1:07:08] and the whole thing just went away just
[1:07:10] like it came.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz it's just a bunch of air.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Just a bunch of emptiness. It's just a
[1:07:16] bunch of vain emptiness. Somebody just
[1:07:19] conjured up in their mind. Thought it'
[1:07:21] be a little catchy thing and we might
[1:07:22] get a few souls saved. What nonsense.
[1:07:25] The scripture says we're saved by the
[1:07:27] word of God, by the incorruptible. And
[1:07:30] the scripture says by the preaching of
[1:07:32] the word, God chose that was the way to
[1:07:35] save those that were lost. Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; And now the people are all caught up
[1:07:41] into a mass hysteria.
[1:07:44] Probably started with some whispers.
[1:07:46] Maybe started with some leaders amongst
[1:07:48] the people, some princes because they
[1:07:50] had a lot of leaders amongst the people.
[1:07:52] What happened to Moses? What? Yeah, I
[1:07:54] don't know what what did happen to him.
[1:07:55] Well, he's been gone. Yeah. And the
[1:07:57] whole thing ripples through the crowd
[1:07:58] and said, and then someone starts out,
[1:08:00] you know, I think we need something to
[1:08:01] go before us and lead us some. We got to
[1:08:03] have we got to have an object in front
[1:08:05] of us. We got to have something. Uh why
[1:08:07] doesn't somebody talk with Aaron? Yeah,
[1:08:08] I think that's a good idea. Let's get
[1:08:09] Aaron. Let's talk to Aaron. And pretty
[1:08:11] soon the whole thing was just a great
[1:08:12] big mass.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; This wasn't just one or two. The people
[1:08:17] rose up
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; and they had finally gotten the decision
[1:08:21] made. Make us some gods that can go
[1:08:24] before us. And they wanted gods who in
[1:08:27] the in the face go before before is pim.
[1:08:30] It's a face. The word is in the Hebrew
[1:08:33] is the face. And the presence is used
[1:08:35] the same for God.
[1:08:37] Exactly the same. It identifies his
[1:08:40] presence in a very personal way. It's
[1:08:42] the very face of God. And so we want
[1:08:46] them to go before us. And then
[1:08:49] God said, "I'm going to I'm going to
[1:08:51] wipe these people off." I mean, he was
[1:08:54] so disturbed and angry with it. And uh
[1:08:59] they said to Moses said in the 23rd
[1:09:02] verse says, "For they said unto me, make
[1:09:04] us gods which shall go before us, for as
[1:09:08] for this Moses, the man that brought us
[1:09:10] up out of the land of Egypt, we ought
[1:09:12] not what has become of him."
[1:09:15] And then God spoke to him in the 34th
[1:09:18] verse, says, "Now therefore," because he
[1:09:21] interceded for them, he says, "Now go
[1:09:23] there. Now, now go and lead the people
[1:09:28] unto the place. Now, he's telling Moses,
[1:09:30] "Now go and lead the people unto the
[1:09:33] place." Because Moses knew it wasn't him
[1:09:36] that was leading. Moses knew that he
[1:09:40] couldn't do anything unless God would
[1:09:42] instruct him. He was in daily contact.
[1:09:46] Moment by moment, he had an immediate
[1:09:49] contact with God and God was leading
[1:09:51] him. And thus he was able to be a leader
[1:09:55] to the people. And he said, "And lead
[1:09:57] the people unto the place which I have
[1:10:00] spoken unto thee. And behold, mine angel
[1:10:04] shall go before thee. Nevertheless, in
[1:10:08] the day when I visit, I will visit their
[1:10:12] sin upon them, their unbelief. I will
[1:10:15] visit them upon them."
[1:10:18] He said lead them
[1:10:21] which also is to guide. You know it's
[1:10:26] it's to to lead a person and to guide a
[1:10:29] person is really two different things.
[1:10:32] Like
[1:10:34] we went up hunting. We took brother
[1:10:35] Brandham up and brother brother Bud
[1:10:38] Southwick and they have an association
[1:10:42] and it's called the guide the trappers
[1:10:44] and guides association.
[1:10:47] A guide isn't just one that walks in
[1:10:49] front of you and just say, you know,
[1:10:51] just walk in my footsteps. That's not a
[1:10:53] guide. He might lead you, but now this
[1:10:57] is more than just leading. A person
[1:10:59] says, "Well, I'll I'll lead you, you
[1:11:01] know, and and just follow this path."
[1:11:03] But a guide, he knows that you have a
[1:11:06] certain objective. And if he's a hunting
[1:11:08] guide, he he he's one that's watching.
[1:11:12] He he he knows what it is that the
[1:11:15] purpose that you're there for. And so he
[1:11:18] will be maybe spot he will look for a
[1:11:21] certain area. He not just climbing
[1:11:24] mountains and going over the cliffs and
[1:11:27] saying just follow me. That wouldn't be
[1:11:29] a guide. He might lead you and he might
[1:11:32] lead you in a safe direction, but he
[1:11:34] might not lead you for for the purpose
[1:11:36] and the objective that you're there. Why
[1:11:39] you're there. Why are we here? We don't
[1:11:41] want to just have we don't want to just
[1:11:43] be led. We want to be guided to a
[1:11:45] certain place. We want to know that that
[1:11:48] there's one going before us that is
[1:11:51] leading us in a in a certain direction.
[1:11:54] And he's watching also for danger. He's
[1:11:57] a guide. He doesn't want to see you come
[1:12:00] into danger. Lead us not into
[1:12:03] temptation. So when he sees areas of
[1:12:06] temptation, he wants to lead the people
[1:12:08] away from it because he's not only a
[1:12:10] leader, he's a guide.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; And that's a big that's a very very
[1:12:16] important element to leadership. We
[1:12:20] don't have just a leader. This message
[1:12:22] is not merely leading us, but it's a
[1:12:24] protective word. It's a guiding word.
[1:12:29] Hallelujah. A person can lead and and
[1:12:32] take you in their footsteps. But you
[1:12:34] might after a while say, "I need some
[1:12:36] water. I need some food. I need some Oh,
[1:12:41] well, we're not in that direction at
[1:12:42] all. We're not near any water." But a
[1:12:45] guide knows you're going to need some
[1:12:47] water. You're going to need some
[1:12:49] sustenance. You're going to need some
[1:12:51] protection. A guide may know that
[1:12:53] there's some weather coming because he
[1:12:56] knows he knows the signs. He can see
[1:12:58] that there's some adverse weather coming
[1:13:01] and he'll guide you to a place where
[1:13:03] you're protected and you won't be
[1:13:05] exposed where your life may be
[1:13:07] threatened. Hallelujah for a guide.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; We don't only have a leader, we have a
[1:13:13] guide.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; And
[1:13:20] this is not when he said lead them
[1:13:23] to this place.
[1:13:26] It would be to guide them. But there's
[1:13:28] another another element to this word
[1:13:32] lead and that is bring them. You will
[1:13:36] bring them. This there's an assurance
[1:13:40] here an absolute certainty. You will
[1:13:43] lead them. You'll show them the
[1:13:45] direction. But you'll also guide them
[1:13:48] because he's watching and caring for
[1:13:51] them. How brother Brandham spoke of of
[1:13:54] God. And it was so tenderly how tenderly
[1:13:57] he cared for them in the wilderness. And
[1:14:00] and the prophet said he busied himself
[1:14:03] with them. He just busied himself. He he
[1:14:07] busied himself caring for them, watching
[1:14:09] over them and bringing them mana from
[1:14:12] heaven and and flesh. Even things that
[1:14:14] they cried for that they shouldn't have
[1:14:16] cried for. But he busied. You know that
[1:14:18] he hasn't changed. He's the same
[1:14:20] yesterday, today, and forever. Oh, if we
[1:14:22] could only know about his tender
[1:14:24] mercies, he is busying himself caring
[1:14:27] for us.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; And the determination is
[1:14:34] you're going to bring them to that
[1:14:37] place.
[1:14:39] You are going to bring them to that
[1:14:41] place. Lead them and bring them to their
[1:14:44] destination.
[1:14:48] There was certainly nothing
[1:14:51] that they could do of the work of their
[1:14:53] own hands. The only thing that they were
[1:14:55] required to do was to hear the voice and
[1:15:00] to obey it. That's what they were
[1:15:03] required to do.
[1:15:06] They couldn't
[1:15:08] attribute
[1:15:10] any of the success of arriving to their
[1:15:12] destination by their own works because
[1:15:16] it wasn't by works.
[1:15:19] The place that their souls crave for and
[1:15:23] which God had purposed,
[1:15:25] the the the souls of the people actually
[1:15:28] craved for this place that God had
[1:15:30] purposed to lead them to.
[1:15:34] And a little later on,
[1:15:37] they're in the land now. Some centuries
[1:15:40] perhaps have gone by and God has raised
[1:15:44] up another prophet to them by the name
[1:15:46] of Samuel.
[1:15:50] And they came to Samuel and they said,
[1:15:54] "You know, we've observed the other
[1:15:57] nations around us. We've observed other
[1:16:00] people. We have saw some Eve saw some
[1:16:04] things and now we've saw some things and
[1:16:08] we've seen things that look appealing to
[1:16:10] us. We'd like to have a king.
[1:16:13] And once again, it wasn't just one or
[1:16:16] two that had the idea, but the whole
[1:16:18] people. This had gone through the whole
[1:16:20] the whole group. You know, we'd like to
[1:16:23] have a king.
[1:16:26] And
[1:16:28] Samuel in the eighth chapter, he
[1:16:31] appealed to them. He said, you know,
[1:16:35] when you get this king,
[1:16:38] you know what he's going to do? He's
[1:16:40] going to take your young men and he's
[1:16:43] going to make them soldiers and they're
[1:16:46] going to go and fight. And he's it he's
[1:16:49] going to have you he's going to take
[1:16:50] your fields. He's going to farm your
[1:16:53] fields for himself. He's going to take
[1:16:55] your your young ladies and he's going to
[1:16:59] make them to work and labor all in his
[1:17:03] for his sole purpose. He he's going to
[1:17:06] have a completely a different a
[1:17:08] different agenda. But and the Bible says
[1:17:10] nevertheless the people refused to obey
[1:17:13] the voice of Samuel and they said nay
[1:17:16] but we will have us a king over us. And
[1:17:20] he he he concluded his appeal to them.
[1:17:22] He said, "Have I taken your money?" They
[1:17:25] said, "No." "Have I ever spoken anything
[1:17:28] in the name of the Lord that wasn't
[1:17:30] true?" Said, "No."
[1:17:32] H Is there any reason why you should be
[1:17:35] doing this? I'm putting it in our
[1:17:37] vernacular. No, there isn't. No. You've
[1:17:40] spoken the truth. You have been indeed a
[1:17:44] a a true prophet of God. You've never
[1:17:47] taken our money. You've never acted
[1:17:49] improperly. But nevertheless, that's
[1:17:52] what they start out with. Nevertheless,
[1:17:56] we like to have a king. We want a king
[1:17:59] over us that we also may be like the
[1:18:03] other nations and that our king may
[1:18:06] judge us and go out before us.
[1:18:11] Now, I want you to get the thought. We
[1:18:13] want him to lead us, go before us, and
[1:18:17] fight our battles.
[1:18:19] And Samuel heard all the words of the
[1:18:22] people, and he rehearsed them in the
[1:18:24] ears of the Lord. And the Lord said to
[1:18:27] Samuel, "Hearken unto their voice, and
[1:18:31] make them a king." And Samuel said unto
[1:18:34] the men of Israel, "Go every man unto
[1:18:37] his city." And God said to Samuel, "They
[1:18:41] haven't rejected you, they've rejected
[1:18:43] me."
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; They thought it was Samuel. They didn't
[1:18:47] recognize that there was an angel of God
[1:18:51] that was leading them. And now they want
[1:18:54] a man. We want a man to go before us
[1:18:56] into battle. You talk about going and re
[1:19:00] being reduced down to the arm of flesh.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Their trust was going to be in a man.
[1:19:06] And uh in the Smyrnian church age,
[1:19:10] brother Brandham makes reference to this
[1:19:13] and he says when they approached Samuel
[1:19:15] and asked for a king, Samuel was so
[1:19:18] dismayed that his heart almost failed
[1:19:22] him.
[1:19:24] God had been leading his people through
[1:19:28] his consecrated
[1:19:30] scripture vindicated prophet and he felt
[1:19:34] that he had been rejected.
[1:19:37] He gathered the people and pleaded with
[1:19:39] them not to turn away from God who had
[1:19:42] carried them like children
[1:19:46] and prospered them and blessed them. But
[1:19:50] they persisted. They said to Samuel,
[1:19:53] "You have never been wrong in your
[1:19:55] leading. You have never been dishonest
[1:19:58] in your financial dealings.
[1:20:01] You have done your best to keep us in
[1:20:04] line with the word of the Lord. We
[1:20:06] appreciate the miracles,
[1:20:09] the wisdom,
[1:20:11] the provision, and the protection. We
[1:20:14] appreciate all of these blessings and
[1:20:16] benefits. We believe in it.
[1:20:20] We like it.
[1:20:22] And furthermore, we don't want to be
[1:20:25] without it.
[1:20:27] It's just that we want a king to lead us
[1:20:30] into battle.
[1:20:32] Now, that is identical. I know people
[1:20:35] today, I talk about the blame game. I
[1:20:37] was only giving some reasons in the last
[1:20:38] couple of weeks. I know people today
[1:20:40] that sat right here and enjoyed the
[1:20:42] blessings of God. They're gone off on
[1:20:44] their own winging ideas and gone here
[1:20:46] and gone there. And you say, "Do you
[1:20:48] believe in the prophet?" Absolutely. We
[1:20:49] believe in the Was he true? Absolutely.
[1:20:51] He was true. We you you believe that
[1:20:53] he's a messenger of Malachi. Oh,
[1:20:55] absolutely. We believe we believe that
[1:20:57] this and we like it and we want it and
[1:21:01] we want the miracles. But nevertheless,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I've got my own idea about things.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; I've got my own I got my own
[1:21:10] denomination. I got my own king. I got
[1:21:13] my own I got my own man or I'm following
[1:21:15] this or I'm following that or I'm
[1:21:17] following something else. And you might
[1:21:19] say, "Well, well, this is exactly what
[1:21:21] the prophet of God said." Yeah, I I I I
[1:21:23] understand. I don't deny that, but
[1:21:24] nevertheless, I'm I'm going my own
[1:21:26] direction
[1:21:30] and we want to he said, "Now, of course,
[1:21:32] when we go out to battle, it is still
[1:21:35] our intention. We still intend to have
[1:21:38] the priests to go ahead with Judah
[1:21:42] following and we will blow the
[1:21:45] trumpets." In other words, we will not
[1:21:47] lose our spiritual inclination.
[1:21:51] We won't we won't completely lose the
[1:21:54] format. We'll still maybe we'll just
[1:21:57] gather in a little house or something
[1:21:59] and be off by ourselves and we'll still
[1:22:01] sing some songs and we'll still blow the
[1:22:04] trumpet and we still want the you know
[1:22:06] we want the kind of the pattern. We want
[1:22:09] it to continue. And he says and and
[1:22:12] we'll still shout and sing. We don't
[1:22:14] intend to stop any of that, but we want
[1:22:17] a king who is one to lead us.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; And God said to Samuel, "See, they've
[1:22:25] not rejected you, but they've rejected
[1:22:29] me,
[1:22:30] me from ruling over them."
[1:22:35] Now this compares with and I will be
[1:22:38] coming to this in another service but
[1:22:41] the rejection of Samuel
[1:22:44] and the acceptance of a king was
[1:22:46] literally the accepting of a
[1:22:48] denominational system a manmade system
[1:22:52] that they wanted to have over them.
[1:22:55] Jesus said I'm just going to drop that
[1:22:57] in and then leave it because I will come
[1:22:59] back to it perhaps in another service.
[1:23:01] Jesus said, "In my father's house are
[1:23:03] many mansions,
[1:23:05] if it were not so, I would have told
[1:23:07] you, I go to prepare a place for you."
[1:23:13] Now, I say to this congregation today
[1:23:17] that those words of our Lord Jesus are
[1:23:20] absolutely true. But I can tell you that
[1:23:24] you will never find that place without
[1:23:27] following in his steps.
[1:23:29] in his steps and having him not only as
[1:23:34] a leader but a guide
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; one that will bring you to that place.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; The place that he has prepared. And if I
[1:23:44] go to prepare a place, I will come again
[1:23:46] and receive you unto myself, that where
[1:23:48] I am, there ye may be also. And whether
[1:23:51] I go, ye you know, and the way you know.
[1:23:56] And Thomas said to him,"Lord,
[1:23:59] we know not whether you go,
[1:24:02] and how can we know the way?" In other
[1:24:04] words, how can we find your footsteps? I
[1:24:06] was thinking
[1:24:08] while I've been studying on this over
[1:24:10] the last
[1:24:12] two, three weeks.
[1:24:18] You know, Satan slithered into
[1:24:22] into God's Eden.
[1:24:24] so deceptive, so cunning, just snuck his
[1:24:28] way in. But today,
[1:24:32] he doesn't even try to hide himself.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; He's right out there.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; You take me the way I am, and you you
[1:24:39] love it or lump it or like it, like it
[1:24:41] or lump it. Here I am, and I'm right
[1:24:44] out. Satan, and all of all of the
[1:24:47] iniquity, he's just, it's like a flood
[1:24:50] tide. Listen friends, I'm not going to
[1:24:54] I'm I'm an optimist of optimist, but
[1:24:56] I'll tell you there's not much to save
[1:24:58] in the world today.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; It has corrupted itself.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; It is so you can't hardly find honesty
[1:25:06] and integrity. Whether it be in politics
[1:25:08] or whether it be in government or
[1:25:10] whether it be in any kind of system or
[1:25:12] whether it be in education, wherever it
[1:25:14] is, you can scarcely find an ingredient
[1:25:17] of real integrity anymore. I a and and
[1:25:20] and I say that Satan has come in a a
[1:25:24] fullblown exposure of himself on the
[1:25:28] streets
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; and everywhere. Absolutely everywhere.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; And uh and and you are it is imposed
[1:25:36] upon you whether you're in a restaurant
[1:25:38] or in a mall or in a store or uh
[1:25:41] wherever you might be uh wherever it is.
[1:25:44] It's just a imposition upon you.
[1:25:48] Whether you're in an airplane or
[1:25:50] wherever, wherever it might be, it's
[1:25:51] just imposed upon the believer
[1:25:55] everywhere.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Whether you work in a place, you might
[1:25:58] want just some peace and quiet. I was in
[1:26:00] a restaurant here some days ago and some
[1:26:03] brothers we wanted to some people we
[1:26:05] wanted to speak and so wasn't hardly
[1:26:07] anyone in the restaurant.
[1:26:10] There's only two or three other people
[1:26:12] and the music was such that it was it
[1:26:16] wasn't bad but it wasn't good. It wasn't
[1:26:19] good for conversation. So we asked the
[1:26:22] girl and we were in a kind of an area by
[1:26:24] ourselves. So we asked the girl, "You
[1:26:26] shut that down for us, please." She
[1:26:29] looked around. Well, I Well, I don't
[1:26:31] know if I can or not. Well, I said, "I'm
[1:26:33] sure that there'll be a control for this
[1:26:34] speaker here. Just go and shut it right
[1:26:36] off."
[1:26:38] And you know, there was nobody in that
[1:26:40] place calling for that. Nobody. Nobody.
[1:26:44] None of the people wanted. They would
[1:26:46] like to have had it quiet so they could
[1:26:47] have, but but that's just a whole spirit
[1:26:50] of the age. We're We're going to do it
[1:26:52] and you're going to like it.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; And if you don't like it, it's just too
[1:26:57] bad. Just sit there and suffer with it.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; That's the way the generation ends.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; It's perverted.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; It's twisted. mentally
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; twisted.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; And that's the generation we're in.
[1:27:13] And our Lord Jesus has come and walked
[1:27:17] in Satan's Eden. But I want you to know
[1:27:21] his footsteps are not that easy to find
[1:27:25] in this generation.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; And I say further, if we don't have the
[1:27:29] leadership of the angel, you won't find
[1:27:32] them.
[1:27:35] in fact is Satan has taken sole control
[1:27:37] of religion.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; He has he has become the master
[1:27:42] interpreter of God's word
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; and he has any interpretation that might
[1:27:48] suit your particular angle of thought or
[1:27:51] your particular uh uh line of life
[1:27:54] however you wish to conduct yourself. He
[1:27:57] has an he has an interpretation for you.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; You understand? Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; And you will never find the footsteps of
[1:28:05] the son of man unless the angel, the
[1:28:09] angel, not the man, but the angel
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; that went before the prophet.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; It was the angel of the Lord. They
[1:28:17] missed the angel all the time.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Whether I whether I go,
[1:28:24] you know, and the way you know." And
[1:28:25] Thomas said, "We don't know." And Jesus
[1:28:27] said unto him, "I am the way, the truth,
[1:28:30] and the life, and no man can come to the
[1:28:32] Father but by me."
[1:28:35] It was him.
[1:28:38] It was him.
[1:28:41] This angel of God, this one that told
[1:28:46] the people the secrets of their heart. I
[1:28:49] have quite a number of quotes. I want
[1:28:51] you to listen very very closely because
[1:28:54] I'm I'm coming with my theme
[1:28:58] in the message perseverant
[1:29:01] in ' 64.
[1:29:05] Brother Brandham said if you've been
[1:29:06] redeemed from anything the pawn broker
[1:29:10] cannot hold you any longer if you're
[1:29:12] redeemed. If you've got the receipt that
[1:29:16] it's redeemed that settles it. He can't
[1:29:19] hold it no more. Then he said, "We've
[1:29:22] got the receipt."
[1:29:25] And so now if you've got faith to cash
[1:29:27] it in,
[1:29:30] but now if he's standing here, if he is
[1:29:33] standing here, here is a here is brother
[1:29:37] Brandham as God's prophet messenger. But
[1:29:40] he said, "Now if he is standing here,
[1:29:49] and me basing all my campaign upon he's
[1:29:53] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:29:58] He said he would know what your trouble
[1:30:01] is talking to a person. And that would
[1:30:05] surely
[1:30:07] see how he's bringing it. That would
[1:30:09] surely, and he breaks, he says, "Me not
[1:30:13] knowing it, it would certainly identify
[1:30:17] it have to be him." He's pointing to
[1:30:22] someone else.
[1:30:28] It had to be some power.
[1:30:32] And it and now here's my key for the
[1:30:36] theme for the next couple of moments in
[1:30:38] the next few quotes. It depends
[1:30:42] on what you think
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; the power would be
[1:30:54] in this age of leadya. One thing that is
[1:30:58] certainly
[1:31:02] prevalent,
[1:31:04] you're allowed to think whatever you
[1:31:05] want to think.
[1:31:08] You're allowed to come up with whatever
[1:31:10] conclusion you want to come up with.
[1:31:13] You can even take the word of God and
[1:31:15] handle it however you want to handle it.
[1:31:17] You can take it as serious as you wish
[1:31:19] or you can take it as light as you want.
[1:31:22] You can take it direct from God or you
[1:31:24] can circumvent it and say well you know
[1:31:27] this or some other you know for some
[1:31:30] other reason and maybe a legitimate
[1:31:32] reason whatever more but but I I I just
[1:31:35] can't be as oh there are some people
[1:31:37] that are really really serious with the
[1:31:40] things of God. We all ought to be.
[1:31:43] But now he comes with this phrase. It
[1:31:45] depends on what you think that power
[1:31:48] would be because because you know that I
[1:31:52] don't know you humanly speaking and I'd
[1:31:56] have to I'd have to be some power and it
[1:31:59] would have to be some power and if you
[1:32:02] believe that to be him.
[1:32:05] If you didn't believe it to be him of
[1:32:07] course you wouldn't be you shouldn't be
[1:32:10] standing here.
[1:32:12] And but if you do believe it to be him,
[1:32:15] then he could tell you what you've done
[1:32:18] or what you're here for or something
[1:32:22] that would increase your faith, wouldn't
[1:32:24] it? But it would depend on what you
[1:32:27] think it is.
[1:32:30] in Greater Than Solomon
[1:32:33] in Tucson.
[1:32:36] Uh,
[1:32:41] now I'm I'm speaking of this Christ
[1:32:44] that's full of grace and truth.
[1:32:49] Full of grace and truth. But most of
[1:32:52] these people, they really were missing
[1:32:56] what Brother Brandham was trying to tell
[1:32:57] them. And I'm simply going back to show
[1:33:00] you. He pointed them continuously to
[1:33:04] another person,
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; someone else. In other words, he was
[1:33:07] telling them it's someone else that
[1:33:09] knows you. I don't know you. Someone
[1:33:11] else that's here knows you. There's
[1:33:14] someone else that's leading you. And now
[1:33:17] he's speaking to a woman and he said,
[1:33:19] "How do you do, lady?
[1:33:21] We're strangers to each other. I don't
[1:33:23] know you and you're a lot younger than I
[1:33:26] am, but do you believe Jesus can tell me
[1:33:29] what your trouble is or something about
[1:33:31] you? Would it give you faith to believe?
[1:33:34] You believe me to be his servant? You
[1:33:37] know, I wouldn't know. It would be
[1:33:38] impossible for me to know.
[1:33:41] I'd have it have to be from him
[1:33:46] spirit.
[1:33:48] and you're conscious at this time that
[1:33:50] there's something going on. It's his
[1:33:54] presence
[1:33:55] or his face
[1:33:58] or the one that's going before me,
[1:34:01] before us. It's him, not me.
[1:34:06] And you're not exactly standing for
[1:34:09] yourself.
[1:34:11] You've got a lot of trouble. You've got
[1:34:12] a spiritual a lot of spiritual problems
[1:34:15] that you're wondering about. And he
[1:34:17] said, "And you're going to get the
[1:34:20] answer for them."
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[1:34:25] that messenger that was there was able
[1:34:27] to say, "And you're going to reach your
[1:34:29] objective
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; because the leader that is here is going
[1:34:33] to bring you to the place where you can
[1:34:36] have the answer.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; You're going to get the answer for them.
[1:34:44] And just to let you know that I know
[1:34:47] what I'm speaking of. Some of it is
[1:34:50] about something going on in your church.
[1:34:54] That is right. It's a business deal.
[1:34:58] It's going on in your church and you
[1:35:00] don't think it's going on right. And
[1:35:03] that's thus saith the Lord. So he told
[1:35:06] her what was happening in her church. A
[1:35:08] business deal was happening in her
[1:35:10] church and she didn't think it was right
[1:35:12] and she was troubled about it. And now
[1:35:14] she's come and got the answer. You're
[1:35:16] going to get the answer.
[1:35:19] And another thing, I see a person
[1:35:21] appearing that's almost dead. It's a
[1:35:25] cancer case. You're praying for cancer.
[1:35:29] Someone in your country and you're also
[1:35:31] from Oregon.
[1:35:34] Because it's the same country the lady
[1:35:36] was here before.
[1:35:39] And you receive what you asked for.
[1:35:41] Return home. Your faith granted to you.
[1:35:44] I never touched the woman but God did.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; I'm taking these early examples and yet
[1:35:53] they're not early. 63 and 64. I'm taking
[1:35:57] these examples to show that even after
[1:35:59] all of these years, he's having to
[1:36:01] punctuate. He's having to penetrate the
[1:36:04] people's minds because we're a lot of
[1:36:08] man followers. We want to have something
[1:36:11] tangible
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; to go before us. We want to have some
[1:36:15] identification even to say, you know,
[1:36:18] well, this is Cloverdale Bible Way.
[1:36:20] Cloverdale Bible Way can't get you to
[1:36:22] your objective.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Bible believers or no other church or
[1:36:27] Brandham Tabernacle or William Brandham
[1:36:29] himself can't get you to the objective.
[1:36:31] It has to be the angel of God that goes
[1:36:34] before him.
[1:36:37] See, none of these things you it we're
[1:36:40] not looking for a tangible we can get
[1:36:42] our hands on. That is why people even
[1:36:44] today that probably gone they they they
[1:36:46] look for something else or they'll turn
[1:36:48] here or turn some other direction to
[1:36:50] some man or some hero or or someone else
[1:36:54] is going to come or or or brother
[1:36:56] Brandham's son or sons are going to
[1:36:58] raise up or something. So, we have
[1:36:59] something out in front of us that it's
[1:37:01] not that isn't even in the equation. The
[1:37:04] thing is it was an angel, the angel of
[1:37:07] God who's none other than the Lord Jesus
[1:37:10] Christ himself in another dispensation,
[1:37:13] another time. And this congregation
[1:37:16] needs to realize that that angel has
[1:37:18] never left this word. That angel is
[1:37:21] guiding the people who are believers
[1:37:24] indeed believers of the word.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; But it depends what you think it is.
[1:37:36] The angel could be right here, but it
[1:37:39] depend on what you thought it was.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; I could be speaking an absolute thus
[1:37:46] sayith the Lord, but it would depend on
[1:37:47] what you say it is.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:38:02] I thought I would like to ask this
[1:38:04] congregation today
[1:38:06] because we have such a diverse way of
[1:38:10] life,
[1:38:12] live in different places,
[1:38:15] work at different kinds of jobs,
[1:38:18] have a whole myriad, just a multitude of
[1:38:21] circumstances. Everybody has their own
[1:38:24] shoes to walk in. Everybody has their
[1:38:27] own set of circumstances.
[1:38:30] But I thought I would like to ask this
[1:38:32] congregation, do you have something
[1:38:35] as a personal individual that hangs
[1:38:39] heavy on your heart this morning
[1:38:43] and you don't exactly know the answer.
[1:38:47] You haven't got sufficient mental powers
[1:38:51] and you don't have even sufficient
[1:38:53] discernment spiritually perhaps to know
[1:38:56] God has held it from you. You don't know
[1:38:59] exactly what you should do. You might be
[1:39:01] in a particular situation and it may it
[1:39:04] may mean it may mean nothing to someone
[1:39:08] who's sitting right beside you, but to
[1:39:09] you
[1:39:12] it it's it's it's a very deep you're
[1:39:14] very deeply involved in it. and and
[1:39:17] maybe it seems like there's no exit.
[1:39:19] There's no way out of it. You just don't
[1:39:21] know which way to turn. But you've got
[1:39:23] that personal dilemma this morning. All
[1:39:28] I can tell you,
[1:39:31] there is one here.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; There is one here that knows your
[1:39:37] answer.
[1:39:40] And I believe that that one, it depends
[1:39:43] on what you think this word is.
[1:39:46] If you think this word is just some of
[1:39:49] you been born in messagebelieving
[1:39:52] households and you if you think well
[1:39:55] this is just mom and dad's religion. I'm
[1:39:58] going to tell you something brother
[1:39:59] Brandham said and I've got three four
[1:40:01] more quotes. Depends on what you think
[1:40:03] it is.
[1:40:06] If you think like the Pharisees did that
[1:40:09] he's just a good teacher,
[1:40:12] he's a good man, he said you will get
[1:40:15] their reward.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; He said if you believe it come direct
[1:40:20] from God, you will get God's reward.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; If you believe it's just a man, you'll
[1:40:31] get a man's reward.
[1:40:35] But if you believe it's of God,
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; you will get that reward. It depends
[1:40:40] what you if you think this is just mom
[1:40:42] and dad's religion, then that's only
[1:40:44] that's the um that's the reward that
[1:40:46] you'll receive.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Just a reward. It'll be a human reward.
[1:40:51] You may have a better life. You will
[1:40:54] have a a father that works. You will
[1:40:57] have food on the table. You'll have
[1:40:59] people who love you more than say some
[1:41:01] ungodly people. You'll have a different
[1:41:04] kind of an environment, but it isn't
[1:41:06] what God has intended for you. Those are
[1:41:09] just some side benefits.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; If you believe, well, it's a good
[1:41:16] church. Bible way is a good church. It's
[1:41:19] the best in the area. It's a it's where
[1:41:22] I hear things. It's where I am uh uh I'm
[1:41:26] cared for and I am fed spiritually. And
[1:41:29] we want that. We want the singing and we
[1:41:31] want the worship. We believe that we'll
[1:41:33] never have that. We want the trumpets to
[1:41:35] blow. We want the priests to carry the
[1:41:37] word. We want all of that. But you have
[1:41:39] to believe further than that. You have
[1:41:41] to believe that this is a angel of the
[1:41:44] Lord that is leading this people on. If
[1:41:47] you don't believe that, then you don't
[1:41:49] belong here.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; It has to be more than just a ministry.
[1:41:54] It has to be more than just a group of
[1:41:56] people. Has to be more than just a
[1:41:58] program or a vision or whatever. more
[1:42:00] that that maybe this congregation has.
[1:42:02] It has to be more than that. And now
[1:42:05] here you might be digging digging in
[1:42:06] your heels, but I can tell you if you
[1:42:08] don't, that's as far as your reward will
[1:42:10] go.
[1:42:16] Do you have something
[1:42:19] that you need an answer for?
[1:42:24] In sers, we would see Jesus.
[1:42:28] Here's a picture.
[1:42:30] It's St. John 4. A man and a woman meets
[1:42:35] for the first time in life to meet face
[1:42:37] to face. Now, I'm only drawing back into
[1:42:42] these quotes, not to use them as a quote
[1:42:45] and not to say, "Well, it was a glorious
[1:42:47] thing back there." I'm saying what was
[1:42:50] back there is present even now.
[1:42:57] the Samaritan woman in our Lord Jesus.
[1:42:59] Now, here's a woman and I don't know
[1:43:01] her. I've never seen her before and
[1:43:04] she's a total stranger. Now, it depends
[1:43:06] on
[1:43:09] what you think it is. You can say Billub
[1:43:15] or you can say Christ.
[1:43:18] If you say Billub,
[1:43:21] you will get his reward. Amen.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; I think Belub,
[1:43:29] prince of the devils, is assigned to the
[1:43:32] lake of fire.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; And I'm certain he's assigned to the
[1:43:38] lake of fire.
[1:43:47] And sometimes, you know,
[1:43:50] we just shoot from the lip.
[1:43:53] Well, I don't think that's of God. Then
[1:43:55] what do you think?
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Might as well say the rest.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; There have been people that have said
[1:44:06] openly and declared that this message
[1:44:10] and this ministry is of the devil, I say
[1:44:13] they are hellbound.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; They are going to hell.
[1:44:19] And furthermore, I do not know but what
[1:44:22] they have blasphemed the Holy Ghost and
[1:44:25] have no opportunity for forgiveness.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; And those happen to be the hard cold
[1:44:30] facts.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Door to the heart. Now depends on what
[1:44:39] you think.
[1:44:42] If you think like the Pharisees, you get
[1:44:44] their reward. If you think like
[1:44:46] Nathaniel, you get his reward.
[1:44:49] You get God's reward if you think it's
[1:44:51] God.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Nathaniel, he wasn't too sure who he
[1:44:59] was.
[1:45:01] And Nathaniel had the secret of his
[1:45:03] heart revealed. And there were
[1:45:04] multitudes, millions had their secret of
[1:45:06] their heart revealed. And that's the
[1:45:08] reward they got. That's as far as it
[1:45:10] went because that's all that they
[1:45:12] expected. And that's all the that was
[1:45:15] what it depended on what they thought
[1:45:17] and their thought was I've come here.
[1:45:20] People say it's meant that lepathy
[1:45:22] people say it's this. People say well
[1:45:23] it's a gift of discernment and what they
[1:45:25] thought is what they got. And Pentecost
[1:45:27] thought it was the gift of discernment
[1:45:29] and that's all they got.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; And the gift is a gift that's gone.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:45:36] But the angel, if they had only
[1:45:38] recognized that what he said over and
[1:45:41] over and over again, multitudes of
[1:45:43] times, if not me, I don't know you, I
[1:45:46] can't know you.
[1:45:48] It is him. There is one here. He's alive
[1:45:51] and we're in his presence and he's the
[1:45:53] only one who can know you. That was the
[1:45:56] one who was leading and that's who those
[1:45:57] people should have continued to follow
[1:45:59] and that's who we must continue to
[1:46:01] follow.
[1:46:05] The children of Israel
[1:46:08] thought it was a man
[1:46:12] and they got a man's reward.
[1:46:15] A man dies
[1:46:17] and they all died in the wilderness. And
[1:46:20] Jesus said, "Furthermore, they're all
[1:46:22] dead. Spiritually dead. Your fathers did
[1:46:26] eat mana in the wilderness and are all
[1:46:29] dead.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Spiritually dead. spiritually separated
[1:46:33] from God. God let them die. Even though
[1:46:36] God, that's why God said to Moses,
[1:46:39] he said, I believe in 23 of Exodus, with
[1:46:43] this angel that's going before you,
[1:46:47] he said, see that you obey him.
[1:46:51] See that you obey him. Even telling
[1:46:54] Moses, see that you obey him. He will
[1:46:56] not he will not forgive your
[1:46:58] transgressions.
[1:47:00] It's amazing.
[1:47:02] how serious it was.
[1:47:05] And so now the people are in the
[1:47:07] wilderness and God God told Moses, "I'm
[1:47:10] going to wipe them off." Moses said,
[1:47:11] "Don't wipe them off. Blot my name out.
[1:47:14] All right, I'll preserve them, but in
[1:47:16] that day,
[1:47:18] I'll visit
[1:47:20] their sins upon them and they died in
[1:47:23] the wilderness."
[1:47:26] I would say the reason they died in the
[1:47:28] wilderness first and foremost was they
[1:47:31] failed to recognize who it was that was
[1:47:34] leading them. They finally got to the
[1:47:36] place who this man Moses, we don't know
[1:47:39] what happened to him.
[1:47:43] If they could have only recognized it
[1:47:45] was the angel that was leading them.
[1:47:50] And I feel
[1:47:52] very very much impressed
[1:47:56] that this congregation realizes
[1:47:59] that who brought this message and I'm
[1:48:01] going to I want to come down to that.
[1:48:06] Time has slipped away on us, but can I
[1:48:08] carry on for a few more moments?
[1:48:13] When Jesus was here on earth in his
[1:48:15] visitation, some thought he was a great
[1:48:18] teacher and that was the reward that
[1:48:21] they got. Others thought he was a
[1:48:23] prophet and that was the reward they
[1:48:26] got. He got their they got their
[1:48:28] blessings like they said like they said
[1:48:30] to Samuel, "We don't want to lose the
[1:48:32] blessings." You know, uh everything that
[1:48:35] you've been you you've been exactly what
[1:48:38] you've said you were and we have nothing
[1:48:40] against that. When Jesus was here, they
[1:48:43] they they acknowledged that he was a
[1:48:45] prophet. And brother Brandham refers to
[1:48:47] said they were they wanted this popular
[1:48:50] prophet. They wanted him. They invited
[1:48:52] him to their feast and so on and so
[1:48:54] forth.
[1:48:56] And that's as far
[1:48:59] as it went. That was the reward that
[1:49:01] they got.
[1:49:02] When Jesus got to the woman at the well
[1:49:06] and he revealed the secret of her heart
[1:49:09] and she knew that he was a prophet
[1:49:12] that was very complimentary to him
[1:49:17] to acknowledge him as a prophet of God
[1:49:20] but it wasn't sufficient and because she
[1:49:22] was an elected seed he had to take her
[1:49:25] further than that she had to realize
[1:49:27] that he was more than a prophet that he
[1:49:30] was indeed the Christ the Messiah, the
[1:49:34] very God in flesh.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; He had to bring her to that.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; While some thought he was a pre a
[1:49:43] teacher, some thought he was a prophet,
[1:49:44] some thought and there was a lot of
[1:49:45] disturbance about it. But Peter was
[1:49:48] convinced. Even though Peter had not
[1:49:50] received the sealing of the Holy Spirit,
[1:49:52] he was still convinced. You may not
[1:49:54] receive, you may not have the Holy Ghost
[1:49:56] this morning. you. Some of you may know
[1:49:59] that you don't have the Holy Ghost. But
[1:50:00] I can tell you one thing you can know.
[1:50:02] You can have a true confession out of
[1:50:04] your mouth. Even though I may not have
[1:50:06] the ceiling of the Holy Spirit, I'm
[1:50:08] going to confess that this is of God.
[1:50:10] This thing is of God. And this is not a
[1:50:13] man leading this thing. It wasn't merely
[1:50:15] a man that brought this message, but it
[1:50:17] was none other than the angel of the
[1:50:18] Lord that has brought it to us.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; That's the confession
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; that you need to make. And Peter, though
[1:50:26] he had not been sealed with the Holy
[1:50:28] Spirit, and Jesus said, "Who do you say
[1:50:30] that I am?" He said, "Thou art the
[1:50:33] Christ, the Son of the living God." And
[1:50:35] Jesus said, "Blessed art thou, Peter,
[1:50:37] for flesh and blood hath not revealed
[1:50:39] this unto thee, but my father that is in
[1:50:42] heaven, he has revealed it unto you. You
[1:50:45] are blessed because you make that
[1:50:47] confession."
[1:50:53] The angel
[1:50:55] of his presence
[1:50:58] is here to answer
[1:51:01] every question. He may not give you the
[1:51:04] answer that you want. Many need a
[1:51:07] definite answer.
[1:51:09] He said to Jesus Christ the same
[1:51:13] message. He said, "You're aware that
[1:51:16] something's going on. You're wondering
[1:51:18] what it is. You realize that something's
[1:51:21] going on." He said, "It's the angel of
[1:51:24] the Lord, his presence. It's the angel
[1:51:27] of the Lord. It's his presence."
[1:51:33] That person may not have
[1:51:36] uh felt any more than you're feeling
[1:51:38] right now where you're sitting.
[1:51:43] Some of you may think, "Oh, if we could
[1:51:45] have only been there." I've been there.
[1:51:47] I've been sitting right where brother
[1:51:48] Tom is. I've sat right on the platform.
[1:51:50] You listen to the Port El Bernie uh Port
[1:51:53] Al Bernie meetings. My wife is playing
[1:51:55] the piano and I'm playing the guitar.
[1:52:00] So, what was that like? Just like you
[1:52:02] sitting here.
[1:52:05] He said, "Really?" Exactly. Brother
[1:52:08] Breda Langard there was leading song
[1:52:10] service. You hear the Dawson Creek
[1:52:11] series? That's him singing at the
[1:52:13] platform. He was leading the song
[1:52:15] service, directing the service.
[1:52:18] What was it? Just like you now.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Well, what would make it different
[1:52:25] depending what you think it was.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that changed it
[1:52:33] depended what you think it was.
[1:52:37] Oh, I think it's a great gift of
[1:52:39] discernment. Great. That's what you got
[1:52:40] for it.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; I think this is a profit of God. That's
[1:52:44] what you got for it.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Well, you said
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; I All of those are great, but they don't
[1:52:52] fit.
[1:52:54] This is something more.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; There is some divine presence.
[1:53:06] I have a sister.
[1:53:09] She might be here today. I don't know.
[1:53:11] She's visiting from the island.
[1:53:14] But my wife and I had
[1:53:17] breakfast with her yesterday.
[1:53:21] over these many many years I haven't had
[1:53:25] perhaps I haven't taken
[1:53:29] the opportunity to
[1:53:31] say what I've wanted to say but in the
[1:53:34] last few months
[1:53:39] brother Brandham spoke to me about her
[1:53:42] on one occasion
[1:53:45] and she I had a crushing burden on my
[1:53:48] heart for her.
[1:53:51] She was only 15 at the time,
[1:53:54] but I had a I was absolutely crushed in
[1:53:57] my heart for her. And I had a second
[1:54:00] thing is that I'd had a call from our
[1:54:05] church in Dawson Creek where id
[1:54:06] pastored, brother Ba had pastored.
[1:54:08] Brother Breda and my sister Anne were
[1:54:10] terribly hurt in a car accident, head-on
[1:54:13] collision by a a drunk driver.
[1:54:18] and and they were barely preserved.
[1:54:20] There happened to be a car directly
[1:54:21] behind him that had a it was a oil field
[1:54:24] car, I believe, had a two-way radio and
[1:54:27] radioed for an ambulance immediately.
[1:54:30] And brother Ba was injured. My sister
[1:54:33] went up through the windshield and was
[1:54:36] cut severely and they were hurt, badly
[1:54:39] hurt. Brother Ba couldn't move. the
[1:54:42] steering wheel was up into his rib cage
[1:54:45] and he couldn't move and he actually
[1:54:47] thought that his wife, my sister, was
[1:54:49] dying and I believe he said something uh
[1:54:52] mother are you leaving us at this time?
[1:54:57] Just a people that are uh perhaps of a
[1:55:01] lower state in life and drinking and
[1:55:05] woman selling gifts, giving her body
[1:55:09] and that's who ran into them. And
[1:55:11] because of that, uh, a young man who
[1:55:15] was, uh, actually intended to come up
[1:55:17] and, I think, start a UPC church
[1:55:22] in Dawson Creek. And brother Ba being
[1:55:26] cordial and asked him, you know, he'd be
[1:55:30] willing to take the pulpit and preach.
[1:55:32] And anyway,
[1:55:34] he did, but I think there was some other
[1:55:36] agenda. Maybe not in his mind. He was a
[1:55:39] nice man, but I think maybe leaders
[1:55:42] intended then to take the church over. I
[1:55:44] got a call anyway from from Cindy
[1:55:47] Bergen's father
[1:55:49] and her uncle. They were two deacons and
[1:55:53] they said, "You better get up here
[1:55:57] because we're losing the church."
[1:56:00] And looked like they were going to get
[1:56:02] the people persuaded to take a vote and
[1:56:04] gain the church and gain the property.
[1:56:06] And that was the second thing that was
[1:56:08] on my heart. And I was crushed. We
[1:56:11] worked with our hands. My father and I,
[1:56:14] we we drove nails. And the people of the
[1:56:17] church worked hard. And we were just a
[1:56:19] small group and built a nice church with
[1:56:23] big laminated arches up. It wasn't. And
[1:56:26] Bud Southwick bowed down on his knees
[1:56:29] with his five sons on this concrete in
[1:56:32] the basement of that church and gave his
[1:56:34] heart to Christ. And it was just not
[1:56:37] long after that then maybe within a year
[1:56:40] and a half or so that brother Brandham
[1:56:43] accepted my invitation to come up
[1:56:45] hunting and now I was I had moved down
[1:56:47] here was going to the native Indian
[1:56:49] people. So I said I would arrange it. I
[1:56:52] called my brother-in-law brother Ba and
[1:56:54] he arranged the meetings there and we
[1:56:56] arranged some meetings in in Grand
[1:56:58] Prairie.
[1:57:01] It was at this time I had these two
[1:57:03] things that were just crushing me on my
[1:57:05] heart.
[1:57:07] And we got way up into the mountains and
[1:57:09] here here I am. I'm in a dilemma.
[1:57:13] I there's things that I heard that
[1:57:15] brother Brandham preaches that I I just
[1:57:17] can't I can't even accept as true. And I
[1:57:22] just, you know, I got these questions in
[1:57:23] my heart. I'm not sure about baptism.
[1:57:25] I'm not sure about the Godhead. I've got
[1:57:29] good friends on both sides of the fence.
[1:57:33] And here I am, a young man, 27
[1:57:36] and then 28 I guess it was. And I'm I'm
[1:57:40] with my I think my second now or third
[1:57:42] time with brother Brandham. And I got
[1:57:44] these two things in my heart. I don't
[1:57:47] know why I'm telling you this, but
[1:57:50] I guess you'll get my point in a moment.
[1:57:54] And I could only stay a few days because
[1:57:55] I had just taken a job. I was in debt. I
[1:57:59] didn't have money to even pay off my
[1:58:01] debt. And in in a year and a half of
[1:58:04] traveling to the Indian people, I got $5
[1:58:08] from one person from our former church.
[1:58:12] I got $5 from them. And I was washing
[1:58:17] floors and walls for janitor service
[1:58:20] owned by the pastor of the church just
[1:58:22] when his boys couldn't do it. I was
[1:58:25] getting uh just a very very meager
[1:58:28] amount that might put food on the table.
[1:58:31] But that wasn't my concern. I had taken
[1:58:34] this job and now I was gone up with
[1:58:36] brother Brandham and I I had to get back
[1:58:38] to work and I could only spare one week
[1:58:42] and I would have to leave early. Brother
[1:58:44] Fred Sauman was there, Brother Brandham,
[1:58:46] Brother Billy Paul, Brother Bud Swick,
[1:58:49] Brother Blaine, and myself, and a native
[1:58:51] Indian, Oscar Macdonald, who perished in
[1:58:54] a fire after that.
[1:58:58] And we were all up there
[1:59:01] and uh the day came. The picture that
[1:59:04] you have, the print,
[1:59:07] that is the noon before this. I'm
[1:59:10] telling you now that was at noon the day
[1:59:13] previous that that picture was taken
[1:59:15] which Marilyn painted
[1:59:17] and that's why it meant so much to me
[1:59:19] and we'd been it was a beautiful
[1:59:20] magnificent day and I had to ride out
[1:59:23] the next morning and I thought surely
[1:59:26] brother Southwick is going to send
[1:59:28] somebody with me. It was about 30 miles,
[1:59:32] 25 to 30 miles right out of virgin
[1:59:35] wilderness in the mountains in the Rocky
[1:59:38] Mountain Trench. And we crossed rivers
[1:59:41] and cross streams. And I didn't know the
[1:59:44] way back. It was grizzly infested with
[1:59:47] grizzlies and all kinds of wild animals.
[1:59:50] And so I said to Brother Bud,
[1:59:53] "Is is Blaine or someone going to ride
[1:59:55] out with me?"
[1:59:56] Oh, he said the horse knows its way
[1:59:58] back.
[2:00:01] Well, I happen to have right ridden
[2:00:03] horses that were so stupid
[2:00:06] that they simply walked into the woods
[2:00:08] and stopped with her head up against a
[2:00:11] tree or a willow and just wanted you to,
[2:00:13] you know, which way do you want me to
[2:00:15] go? And I knew that I wouldn't know the
[2:00:18] way. And furthermore, where you where
[2:00:21] you cross these streams and rivers,
[2:00:23] especially, these are mountain rivers,
[2:00:25] glacier water. And where you cross them
[2:00:28] was critical. If you didn't cross them
[2:00:31] exactly, you could get into deep water,
[2:00:34] the horse would roll over and soon as a
[2:00:36] horse gets water in its nostrils, it's
[2:00:38] gone. It almost is pretty well sure
[2:00:41] thing that he drowns. And so I I was so
[2:00:45] nervous and apprehensive about this. I
[2:00:47] couldn't believe he was going to send me
[2:00:48] out by myself. And the next morning I
[2:00:51] woke up and guess what? We were in the
[2:00:54] midst of the most terrible snowstorm
[2:00:57] that you could imagine.
[2:00:59] And I thought this snowstorm, you can't
[2:01:02] hardly see your way. Surely they're
[2:01:04] going to send someone out with me. No.
[2:01:07] We had breakfast and everybody's in the
[2:01:09] cook tent
[2:01:11] and I could hear their conversation. I
[2:01:13] had had my breakfast and I went back. It
[2:01:15] was the only time I'd slept in another
[2:01:17] tent and and I slept in that tent with
[2:01:19] brother Brandham and brother Sothman. We
[2:01:21] were three in that tent. And I went back
[2:01:24] in a tent cuz I had to leave. I had 8 to
[2:01:27] 10 hour ride to go out. And I remember
[2:01:31] to this moment I was rolling up my
[2:01:34] sleeping bag. I was so heavy and I
[2:01:37] hadn't got an opportunity to say a word,
[2:01:40] not a word, because there just so much
[2:01:42] activity and brother Brandham was having
[2:01:45] his relaxation. I wasn't going to bother
[2:01:47] him with my burdens and I was rolling up
[2:01:49] that sleeping bag
[2:01:51] and I thought of it this morning.
[2:01:56] Instead of Abraham in the tent door, I
[2:01:58] was in the tent.
[2:02:01] And I was rolling up my bag and the
[2:02:02] flaps opened up and Brother Brandham
[2:02:05] came crawling in on his hands and knees
[2:02:09] and he sat squat style with his legs
[2:02:12] squatted like that.
[2:02:16] Oh, Brother Eddie said, "Sure, sorry to
[2:02:19] see you go." And I remember just like it
[2:02:22] was yesterday or five minutes ago. I bit
[2:02:25] my lip. I didn't want to break down in
[2:02:28] front of him. I bit my lip.
[2:02:32] I said, "Yeah, Brother Brandham,
[2:02:35] I hate to go, too."
[2:02:37] Oh. He said, "You know, if you could
[2:02:39] just stay." He said, "You know, Brother
[2:02:41] Eddie, you could stay here and we'd we'd
[2:02:43] be here for a month and the sun would
[2:02:46] come out and shine and we'd ride up
[2:02:49] along here." And he just went into some
[2:02:52] euphoria.
[2:02:54] said we'd see some big rams and I
[2:02:57] remember distinctly I said in my heart
[2:02:59] don't do this to me brother Brad don't
[2:03:02] do this to me
[2:03:05] and then he just turned serious
[2:03:08] he said but
[2:03:10] I know I understand he said you have a
[2:03:13] family you got responsibilities
[2:03:17] I understand
[2:03:19] and I understand all about your sister
[2:03:22] and the church in Dawson Greek.
[2:03:27] Now listen friends,
[2:03:31] I know the man.
[2:03:33] He come from Jeffersonville.
[2:03:36] He drove a car. He drove a Ford station
[2:03:39] wagon. But that one that was speaking
[2:03:42] through him at that moment was God.
[2:03:45] God alone knew about my sister. And God
[2:03:50] alone knew about the church in Dawson
[2:03:53] Creek. And yesterday I related this to
[2:03:55] her and I said it has come back to me
[2:03:59] and I have been in prayer saying God
[2:04:03] what was in your mind.
[2:04:06] What were you thinking
[2:04:09] when you said I know all about my
[2:04:12] sister?
[2:04:16] And yesterday
[2:04:18] I told her that in detail
[2:04:21] and I I said, "What was God thinking
[2:04:24] when he said all about my sister?" I
[2:04:27] said, "It wasn't just your state back
[2:04:29] then,
[2:04:31] but he knows all about you." And her
[2:04:34] eyes brimmed with tears.
[2:04:37] She said, "That's quite a statement to
[2:04:38] end
[2:04:40] end our visit on." I said, "Yes, it is."
[2:04:44] I know it penetrated her heart. I want
[2:04:48] to say as a testimony this congregation,
[2:04:51] I believe that what we believe, I
[2:04:54] believe in the word that has been
[2:04:56] unveiled. I believe in the Christ that
[2:04:59] has been unveiled is the result of the
[2:05:02] angel of the Lord that has gone before
[2:05:05] us in this generation. It is none other
[2:05:08] than the angel of God that has come and
[2:05:11] spoke these things and taken a human's
[2:05:14] lips and vindicated him. That's why he
[2:05:16] vindicated him. So we would believe. So
[2:05:19] you would believe. So there'd be no
[2:05:22] excuse not to believe. From the youngest
[2:05:24] to here, you can understand. We don't
[2:05:27] need just a leader. We need a guide. We
[2:05:30] need a protector. We need a provider. We
[2:05:34] need someone who will busy himself with
[2:05:37] our affairs. And I want to say to you,
[2:05:40] we have one.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus Christ, the same yesterday or
[2:05:45] today. Not some imagination figure of
[2:05:47] the past, but we have the angel of the
[2:05:50] Lord.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip something, but I want
[2:05:57] to come to something. I'm going to
[2:05:58] close.
[2:06:03] I want to I want to address you very
[2:06:06] seriously now just for a moment on the
[2:06:09] person of Jesus Christ. This last
[2:06:11] Tuesday was the 39th anniversary of
[2:06:15] brother Brandham speaking his last
[2:06:17] service leadership
[2:06:20] last
[2:06:22] the last thought that would be uttered
[2:06:26] out of that vindicated mouth
[2:06:30] was leadership.
[2:06:33] If there's anything
[2:06:36] that we would need
[2:06:38] is a leader. Amen.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; In these days,
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; I'll say to you
[2:06:45] authoratively, you will never find your
[2:06:48] way
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; outside of this leader.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; You'll never discover the direction you
[2:06:53] should go. You'll never come to the
[2:06:56] right decisions. You will never be able
[2:06:58] to to discover what you should what the
[2:07:01] answer is for these things because
[2:07:03] today's dilemma is not tomorrow's
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; and tomorrow's questions are not next
[2:07:09] week. We need a a leader that will busy
[2:07:12] himself with our affairs and guide us
[2:07:15] through this life. And we have a leader,
[2:07:19] none other than the angel of the Lord
[2:07:22] that was in the burning bush in Egypt,
[2:07:25] in the wilderness rather, in the desert,
[2:07:27] the backside of the desert. The one that
[2:07:29] went before them, the one they missed,
[2:07:32] the one they thought was a man,
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; not a man, friends, the angel of the
[2:07:39] Lord.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; And it depends on what you think it is.
[2:07:45] I'm saying
[2:07:49] if you think, well, that was brother
[2:07:50] Ed's experience and that's fine. That's
[2:07:52] fine for him. That'll be your reward.
[2:07:56] That's all a reward you'll get and it
[2:07:57] won't be very much. If you think it's
[2:08:00] just a man, you'll get a man's reward.
[2:08:02] You'll just die, go to the grave.
[2:08:05] There's no promise in a man's reward.
[2:08:10] But if you say, "Brother Ed,
[2:08:15] I'm believing what I'm hearing."
[2:08:18] And it's touching it's it's touching
[2:08:20] something very deep within me. And I may
[2:08:23] not understand it all, but I don't want
[2:08:26] I don't want to allow anything to escape
[2:08:28] me. I want it to penetrate me. I want it
[2:08:32] to permeate every part of my being. And
[2:08:35] And you'll say, "Oh, God. God that spoke
[2:08:39] these things, God that brought this
[2:08:41] word, come and take me. Don't let me sit
[2:08:44] in this service and just think it's
[2:08:46] another Sunday meeting. It's not another
[2:08:48] Sunday meeting.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; I feel as though week by week, we're
[2:08:55] almost a milestone at a time.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Incredible things.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. that God wants to guide us to.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul, and here's my closing
[2:09:10] thought.
[2:09:12] Brother Brandham said to a group of
[2:09:14] people, said, "You're crowded in here."
[2:09:19] And it was not that comfortable to the
[2:09:22] people that were there. He said, "You
[2:09:24] haven't been here for 8 hours." I guess
[2:09:26] the time they were waiting and then the
[2:09:28] time they were sitting in church. You
[2:09:29] haven't been here for eight hours for
[2:09:32] your curiosity. He said, "I don't
[2:09:33] believe that."
[2:09:38] He said, "You didn't come here to be
[2:09:39] seen." He said, "I don't believe that."
[2:09:43] You didn't come here just to hear
[2:09:44] somebody preach. I don't believe that
[2:09:46] either.
[2:09:48] You people that come across the border,
[2:09:50] I'm so humbled every time I go back and
[2:09:53] forth across the border myself.
[2:09:56] Whether you have nexus or not, Nexus,
[2:09:57] it's still a pain.
[2:10:00] And you that drive long distances and
[2:10:03] get up early and get your family
[2:10:05] together and put them in the car and go
[2:10:07] home, maybe have your lunch here and go
[2:10:09] home late at night. You didn't come here
[2:10:12] out of curiosity this morning. You
[2:10:14] didn't come here just to be seen. You
[2:10:16] didn't I don't believe that either. You
[2:10:18] didn't come here just to sit with
[2:10:20] somebody and to be here. You didn't come
[2:10:22] because there's an obligation.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Then we have to say, why did we come? We
[2:10:27] I don't believe you come here because
[2:10:29] it's just your habit.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; I don't believe you come because it was
[2:10:33] going to be some financial or some
[2:10:34] material gain. I don't believe you moved
[2:10:36] across the seas and across the country
[2:10:39] and across the land. I don't believe you
[2:10:41] did it just for your some little natural
[2:10:44] benefit. I don't believe that for a
[2:10:46] minute. I believe that you came for the
[2:10:48] right purpose and God in heaven. What a
[2:10:51] responsibility upon my own shoulders.
[2:10:53] May the God of heaven confirm to you
[2:10:55] that you are here following the angel of
[2:10:58] the Lord.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, and we give him such esteem this
[2:11:07] morning. I give him all the glory. And
[2:11:09] that is why I wanted to sing. He came to
[2:11:11] me. He came to me.
[2:11:15] A man crawled in the tent door when I
[2:11:18] was crushed with a dilemma on my heart.
[2:11:21] It wasn't merely a man. It was God
[2:11:23] hiding in flesh.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; And I hope you understand that
[2:11:27] correctly. And that's why I'm going to
[2:11:29] just conclude with this most important
[2:11:31] most important thought. The person of
[2:11:34] Jesus Christ. Apostle Paul said these
[2:11:37] words. He said, "To whom you forgave
[2:11:40] anything, I forgive also. For if I
[2:11:43] forgave anything, to whom I forgave it
[2:11:46] for your sakes, forgave I it in the
[2:11:51] person of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:58] Brother Brandham said in the Jubilee
[2:12:00] year,
[2:12:02] now the same one that sent the Lord
[2:12:04] Jesus Christ here by his spoken word, he
[2:12:09] said it materialized and became the son
[2:12:13] of God. Amen.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; As an innocent for the guilty to redeem
[2:12:18] us back to fellowship to God that we
[2:12:21] might who are once alienated for God
[2:12:25] from God can now be brought nigh to God
[2:12:28] by the offering of the blood of the
[2:12:30] righteous son of God.
[2:12:33] God materialized
[2:12:36] himself
[2:12:38] in a body of flesh.
[2:12:40] And the scripture says by a new living
[2:12:43] way which he hath consecrated for us
[2:12:45] through the veil that is his flesh. The
[2:12:48] veil
[2:12:49] just bear with me now a few m moments.
[2:12:53] The veil was his mask
[2:12:57] and I I was interested. I thought I will
[2:12:59] look cuz in the leadership brother
[2:13:02] Brandham says
[2:13:04] oh I was so touched. You want to go home
[2:13:06] and listen to it?
[2:13:08] And these are Christian businessmen
[2:13:11] international.
[2:13:13] These men are stalwarts of churches.
[2:13:16] These men feel a mission to take the
[2:13:19] gospel to the world. These men actually
[2:13:20] believe the church has failed, that
[2:13:22] denominations have failed. They're all
[2:13:24] split up. They actually believe that the
[2:13:26] ministry has failed and God has raised
[2:13:29] us up and we've been able to break down
[2:13:31] and cross all the barriers of
[2:13:33] denomination. God is using us. He has
[2:13:35] prospered us. We have the money. We have
[2:13:38] the means. We have the talent. We've got
[2:13:40] the men. And here comes a prophet says
[2:13:42] doing God a service without his will.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Just cuz you've got the money, got the
[2:13:46] means, got the talent, got everything,
[2:13:48] doesn't mean you've got the mission. Yet
[2:13:50] you've got been called by the by the
[2:13:52] Holy Spirit anointing. And he was
[2:13:54] telling them, don't do it.
[2:13:59] And he's talking to these people and he
[2:14:01] talks about the rich young ruler
[2:14:05] and how he was led by his mother took
[2:14:08] him by the hand, by his father who
[2:14:11] taught him how to be successful in
[2:14:13] business, by the rabbi who taught him
[2:14:15] all the laws of God. And the scripture
[2:14:18] says, "And Jesus beholding him loved
[2:14:21] him."
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus loved him.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? He was a nice fine young
[2:14:28] man, successful, honorable, respectful,
[2:14:32] and one that could take out of the heart
[2:14:34] of Jesus Christ. He loved him for it,
[2:14:42] he said. But he
[2:14:45] refused
[2:14:46] eternal life.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; He was religious.
[2:14:51] He kept the whole law of Moses which
[2:14:54] very few people could say but he could
[2:14:57] not he could not accept
[2:15:01] the person
[2:15:04] of eternal life. And brother Brandman
[2:15:05] uses the term the person of Jesus Christ
[2:15:09] and uses the term the person
[2:15:12] of eternal life. And there it was right
[2:15:14] there in front of those people. And it's
[2:15:16] like a salvation message. Don't don't
[2:15:18] reject the eternal life. Don't reject.
[2:15:21] Those people must have been. They're so
[2:15:23] quiet. When you listen to it, you'll
[2:15:24] hear so quiet. Hardly gets any amens out
[2:15:26] of it. Because those people said, "I've
[2:15:28] been saved for years.
[2:15:31] I've spoken tongues. I've got the gifts
[2:15:34] of the spirit." What is this man
[2:15:36] speaking about? And there was God hiding
[2:15:39] behind a mask telling them, "They've
[2:15:42] missed it.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Look where they are today. Look where
[2:15:47] their organizations are today. Look
[2:15:49] where Pentecost is today. It's a
[2:15:51] disgrace to the name of Christ
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; and the things they allow. It needs to
[2:15:56] be cried out against. It needs to be
[2:15:59] cried out against. I say, and you need
[2:16:01] to support it with everything you have
[2:16:03] in it. Any man, any person that will
[2:16:06] stand up and make a declaration of
[2:16:09] what's truth is truth and what's
[2:16:11] falsehood is falsehood. There's no gray
[2:16:13] areas. Friends, I'm not at all uh angry,
[2:16:16] but I'm disturbed. I'm disturbed at at
[2:16:19] what Satan has uh been able to
[2:16:22] camouflage
[2:16:24] and have good people. They're good
[2:16:26] people, lots of good people there, but
[2:16:28] they got to come out.
[2:16:34] And so I wanted to find out what is
[2:16:37] brother Brandham used that term the
[2:16:38] person
[2:16:40] of eternal life.
[2:16:43] What is a person?
[2:16:45] And with this a few thoughts I'm going
[2:16:47] to close.
[2:16:50] According to Encyclopedia Britannica, a
[2:16:53] person
[2:16:54] is a human being
[2:16:57] as including the body
[2:17:00] and mind.
[2:17:03] A person
[2:17:05] is a part acted
[2:17:07] on the stage in person.
[2:17:12] Present in the flesh,
[2:17:15] present and acting for oneself.
[2:17:19] A person is one that may be acting on
[2:17:23] the stage
[2:17:25] acting out
[2:17:28] in person
[2:17:30] in the flesh present and acting for
[2:17:34] oneself
[2:17:35] and you'd find as I did
[2:17:39] persona
[2:17:42] and persona is two words per which means
[2:17:48] through
[2:17:50] through and sus a mask, a sound rather,
[2:17:56] through
[2:17:58] making a sound. And persona,
[2:18:02] the encyclopedia said, is a mask for
[2:18:05] actors,
[2:18:09] a sound
[2:18:11] coming through
[2:18:12] a mask
[2:18:14] or a veil.
[2:18:17] And there
[2:18:19] stood a prophet, a veil for the almighty
[2:18:22] God, a veil for the angel of the Lord
[2:18:26] with a sound coming through the mask
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; to that group of people blind,
[2:18:35] blinded by their religion.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; But God with such clarity telling them
[2:18:42] there was a rich young man. He was
[2:18:45] successful like you businessmen. But
[2:18:47] when he got confronted, he knew the law
[2:18:50] and he kept the law. He had an
[2:18:52] impeccable record. He was respectful. He
[2:18:54] went to the synagogue. He went to church
[2:18:57] as you have today. But when he was
[2:18:59] confronted with the person, the person
[2:19:02] the person that the children of Israel
[2:19:05] missed,
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; as for this man,
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; we don't know what happened to him. They
[2:19:12] missed it. They thought it was a man,
[2:19:14] but it was the angel of the Lord that
[2:19:17] was speaking through a mask.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Does this congregation understand what
[2:19:22] I'm preaching today? Do you understand
[2:19:24] what it is?
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, when you
[2:19:29] begin to take a hold of that message,
[2:19:31] you'll find out it was the angel of the
[2:19:33] Lord. It was even God himself, the angel
[2:19:37] of the Lord,
[2:19:39] his presence, his face right here. But
[2:19:43] it depends what you think it is,
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; what kind of devotion you think it
[2:19:48] requires.
[2:19:51] Oh, it's a hit and miss situation. It's
[2:19:53] just when I feel just right. It's when
[2:19:54] it's all comfortable, when it's all
[2:19:55] convenient.
[2:19:59] Brother Brandham was in that message
[2:20:02] done.
[2:20:04] He said,
[2:20:06] "I want to leave it to this
[2:20:08] congregation." He said, "Who's
[2:20:11] leading you now?"
[2:20:13] That's what's important.
[2:20:16] Could be your job.
[2:20:19] Young ladies, it could be your beauty,
[2:20:22] your youthful beauty. Young men, your
[2:20:25] strength,
[2:20:27] your education.
[2:20:29] your future.
[2:20:32] And if anything begins to
[2:20:35] contravene
[2:20:37] the words that came by the angel of the
[2:20:39] Lord,
[2:20:41] you suddenly have another God.
[2:20:45] And that God is going before you.
[2:20:49] And you'll live in his presence. And he
[2:20:52] won't stop dictating and telling you how
[2:20:54] you're going to order your life and what
[2:20:56] you're going to do and what you're not
[2:20:58] going to do and where you're going to go
[2:20:59] and what where you're going to go. And
[2:21:01] that why I say we need to make
[2:21:05] absolutely certain
[2:21:07] that none other but God himself.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Not your imagination of what you think
[2:21:14] God is but of what God expressed.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; This this word he spoke this word. It
[2:21:20] didn't come to a man. And now I say to
[2:21:24] you, we call ourselves the body of
[2:21:27] Christ, the word made flesh persona.
[2:21:32] There's a sound coming through this
[2:21:35] mask,
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; this mask called the bride of Jesus
[2:21:39] Christ. There's a sound and it's none
[2:21:42] other than the same one who spoke back
[2:21:46] then who has spoken this generation that
[2:21:49] wants to utter something out of you and
[2:21:51] through you. It will be a sound coming
[2:21:54] through. It might just be an act. It
[2:21:56] might be something that has to wait for
[2:21:58] years. As I found yesterday, it waited
[2:22:01] for many, many, many years. But I thank
[2:22:04] God
[2:22:08] that we're able to live a life
[2:22:16] that will confirm that what you're
[2:22:18] saying and what's coming out of your
[2:22:19] mouth is true.
[2:22:22] That what comes out of your mouth and
[2:22:23] what is expressed in your life are not
[2:22:25] two different things. They must be the
[2:22:28] truth. And and if we say, "Well, yeah,
[2:22:30] it's you know, I know it's I know that
[2:22:32] it should be different. All the rest of
[2:22:33] it, then who's God?"
[2:22:36] Oh,
[2:22:38] I tell you what, I got another message
[2:22:39] coming up. I can tell you that some
[2:22:42] magazines
[2:22:44] have taken the place of God.
[2:22:47] Some fashion designer has taken the
[2:22:49] place of God.
[2:22:51] You say, "Are you are you are you
[2:22:53] absolutely is that really what you're
[2:22:54] saying?" That's exactly what I'm saying.
[2:22:57] You'd say, "Well, how in the world could
[2:22:59] that be?" The same way as some earrings
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; and other bracelets that went into a
[2:23:06] fire and came out a calf became a god.
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; That became a god. You say, "Well,
[2:23:12] that's absolutely absurd. They had the
[2:23:14] angel. They had the pillar of fire. They
[2:23:16] had the pillar of cloud. They had a
[2:23:18] prophet." Yes. And so do we.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; So do we. So are we.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "What
[2:23:29] happened?" Church said, "You seen too
[2:23:31] much television." He's talking about
[2:23:33] that. Why? Because what they saw on
[2:23:35] television became their god.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; They saw there how they're to dress.
[2:23:40] They saw there how they're to speak.
[2:23:41] They saw there how they're to act, how
[2:23:43] children would treat their parents with
[2:23:45] such disrespect. And that became their
[2:23:47] god.
[2:23:50] Satan is devising every way, every way
[2:23:52] conceivable to w to to uh
[2:23:57] make his way into our homes or make his
[2:24:00] way into our lives. I tell you, my
[2:24:02] precious friends, fathers, mothers,
[2:24:06] young people, there's only one answer to
[2:24:09] this generation, and it is the word that
[2:24:11] God has sent vindicated in the mouth of
[2:24:14] a prophet. But it is the angel of the
[2:24:16] Lord. It is his own. It is his own. The
[2:24:20] presence of Christ. His own personal
[2:24:23] presence identified amongst us.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:24:32] I want to sing.
[2:24:37] He leadeth me. He leadeth me. What a
[2:24:41] blessed thought that he leadeth me.
[2:24:47] What do you think about it?
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; I say to you this morning,
[2:24:52] it depends on what you think of it. It
[2:24:54] was It depends on what you think it is.
[2:25:01] It's really amazing.
[2:25:09] It's really amazing.
[2:25:15] I just have to be careful. I don't want
[2:25:17] to move anymore forward. We've I've kept
[2:25:19] here a long time.
[2:25:22] But it's really amazing
[2:25:25] how clear the message can be
[2:25:31] and what response it gets. What response
[2:25:33] it gets. And I'm talking about every
[2:25:36] area of Christian life.
[2:25:39] Every area.
[2:25:42] every area of Christian life.
[2:25:48] Not long ago,
[2:25:51] few days ago,
[2:25:53] the brothers who watch the internet and
[2:25:55] I don't watch it much. They just send me
[2:25:58] a little. It It's quite costly.
[2:26:02] Costs a lot.
[2:26:05] Almost 50% of the people on the internet
[2:26:10] were people of the congregation
[2:26:13] sitting at home streaming.
[2:26:17] If a person is sick, afflicted, or for
[2:26:20] one reason or another, but you belong
[2:26:23] here in the house of God,
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; not streaming, sitting at home.
[2:26:30] Now, you be careful.
[2:26:33] It depends what you think that is.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; I can prove from the word of God that
[2:26:39] you're supposed to be in the house of
[2:26:40] God.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; We are edified
[2:26:45] by that which every joint supply.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; Every joint supply.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; It's needful to be here in the house of
[2:26:57] God. Not for my benefit, for your
[2:27:00] benefit. And for those that are
[2:27:01] streaming right now for your benefit if
[2:27:04] at all you can't. And we have people
[2:27:05] that are ready to sell out, ready to
[2:27:08] ready to do almost the impossible just
[2:27:11] so they can get to be here. Ready to
[2:27:13] sell out lands and at a senior life
[2:27:17] senior age in their life don't even know
[2:27:19] how they would live here in this costly
[2:27:23] place. But they're prepared to do that.
[2:27:25] They want to do that. Help us. Help us
[2:27:28] just to find a place. We don't know how
[2:27:29] we'll live, but we want to be there
[2:27:31] because we need the fellowship. We need
[2:27:34] to be there.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; We need to be in the house of God.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, was it just Brother Bride?
[2:27:44] Was it just the man who said you should
[2:27:46] be at the doors
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; waiting?
[2:27:53] Or does that actually have its roots
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; in here?
[2:27:58] And was it William Brandham or was it
[2:28:00] actually the angel
[2:28:02] that was saying it?
[2:28:05] Now it depends on you what you think it
[2:28:07] is.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Everything that you do, whether it be
[2:28:12] you're giving at the tithe box.
[2:28:16] Maybe some of you young couples, you
[2:28:17] haven't got started yet. You haven't
[2:28:19] started tithing. And I may I'm quite
[2:28:21] aware of that. I don't go and check it
[2:28:23] out. I never look at it. Never. People
[2:28:27] called me and said, "Oh, we had a uh you
[2:28:29] know, our our check or something." I
[2:28:31] said, "Don't talk to me. I don't know
[2:28:32] anything about it." Somebody said, "I I
[2:28:34] got to catch up on my tithe because uh
[2:28:38] if you you know, I I my receipts show
[2:28:40] that I haven't paid my tithe." I said,
[2:28:42] "I don't know a thing about it. I don't
[2:28:44] look at them." That's between you and
[2:28:46] God.
[2:28:48] I can tell you it depends what you think
[2:28:50] it is.
[2:28:52] You think, "Oh, well,
[2:28:55] uh,
[2:28:57] we can't get started yet because we just
[2:29:00] got married and we've got so many debts
[2:29:01] and we've got so many things that we've
[2:29:03] got to do
[2:29:06] that we get your reward."
[2:29:08] Then people wonder, why is it I'm having
[2:29:11] such difficulty? Why is it why isn't the
[2:29:15] blessing of God on me? Because you
[2:29:17] haven't been honest with God. you you
[2:29:19] haven't even come where the blessing can
[2:29:21] begin to fall. You're not there. And so
[2:29:25] if now we got to say
[2:29:29] that's God or it's not God or it's just
[2:29:32] something for the Old Testament or that
[2:29:34] was just Brother Brenham's idea.
[2:29:37] Be careful now.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; You'll be found in the same place.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; Say this man. It's
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; not the man. And it certainly isn't this
[2:29:46] man.
[2:29:48] It's some man. No, it's not a man.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the church. The church needs
[2:29:54] the money. I can tell you the church
[2:29:55] doesn't need it.
[2:29:57] But you need to give it.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; You need to give it. You need to give
[2:30:02] it. You young couples, you need to
[2:30:03] start. You say, "Well, I I can't because
[2:30:06] of I have this and that, and by the time
[2:30:07] I add it all up, oh, are you actually
[2:30:11] spending God's money to pay your to pay
[2:30:12] your bills?
[2:30:14] Are you spending God's money to pay off
[2:30:16] your car?
[2:30:18] Is that really what you're doing? Well,
[2:30:21] uh, you know what happens?
[2:30:25] This is where I'm going to be coming to.
[2:30:26] I'm just giving you a heads up. It's
[2:30:28] where I'm going to be coming to. That
[2:30:30] thing that you reasoned out has become
[2:30:33] your God.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; And that's what's going.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; That is what's leading you. That has
[2:30:39] become your God and displaced this God.
[2:30:42] Amen.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; And the church can say
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:30:51] And I'm not into this preaching tithe so
[2:30:55] you'll be blessed.
[2:30:57] You tithe whether you're blessed or not
[2:30:59] blessed. It's not yours in the first
[2:31:01] place. Like somebody I heard say not too
[2:31:04] long ago, he said, "It's not only the
[2:31:05] tithing that's God, it's all God's. He
[2:31:07] gave you 90%.
[2:31:14] You might say, "Well, that's just
[2:31:15] Brother Ed. That's fine. That'd be all
[2:31:17] right, too."
[2:31:19] God bless you.
[2:31:22] I've kept you a long time, but I have to
[2:31:25] unbburden my heart. Let's stand, shall
[2:31:28] we?
[2:31:31] Let's start the first verse, please.
[2:31:36] He leadth
[2:31:38] me. Oh, bless his heart on all words
[2:31:45] with heavenly
[2:31:48] comfort
[2:31:49] brought.
[2:31:54] I do wherever I be
[2:32:00] still
[2:32:02] God's hand that leadth
[2:32:06] me.
[2:32:09] He leadth
[2:32:11] me.
[2:32:13] He leadth
[2:32:15] me. My strong hand has he leadth
[2:32:22] me.
[2:32:24] His faithful
[2:32:27] father
[2:32:29] I would be for by his hand
[2:32:35] he lead
[2:32:37] me.
[2:32:40] Sometimes
[2:32:42] it seems our deepest blue.
[2:32:49] where sins
[2:32:51] flowers
[2:32:58] still
[2:33:00] Follow she
[2:33:07] that lead
[2:33:10] me.
[2:33:12] He lead
[2:33:14] me. He leadth
[2:33:18] me by his hand. He leadth
[2:33:25] me.
[2:33:29] full power.
[2:33:32] I will be
[2:33:37] happy.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon made that
[2:33:44] statement,
[2:33:46] you're not here for your curiosity.
[2:33:50] Are you coming to show your clothes? He
[2:33:51] said, no sir, I don't believe that.
[2:33:55] come to spend hours in the tabernacle
[2:33:57] like this congested and jammed together,
[2:34:00] you've sat here longer, perhaps twice
[2:34:02] longer than the average church.
[2:34:05] He said, "You wouldn't do it for
[2:34:06] curiosity
[2:34:08] or to show close. It's because that
[2:34:12] something in you,
[2:34:14] something in you is leading you to do
[2:34:18] it."
[2:34:19] And I believe in my heart of hearts this
[2:34:22] morning that there's something in you
[2:34:24] that's pushing you. He said another
[2:34:27] place that's pushing you. It's causing
[2:34:29] you to believe.
[2:34:31] And we have some that are needy. We're
[2:34:35] going to pray for some that are needy.
[2:34:39] Uh Sharon, my granddaughter, is in need.
[2:34:43] And there may be some others. And I felt
[2:34:45] that those that are in real physical
[2:34:49] need or spiritual need, if you want to
[2:34:52] come, especially I want to anoint with
[2:34:54] oil this morning. And I feel to anoint
[2:34:56] with oil. I've been requested to anoint
[2:35:00] with oil.
[2:35:02] And uh brother Marco, I'd like you to
[2:35:05] come if you would. Brother Michael, Mike
[2:35:08] Hunt, if you would as father. Are there
[2:35:10] others here that have need to be
[2:35:13] anointed with oil? All that come and
[2:35:15] stand, I'm going to anoint them with
[2:35:17] oil. And I would like the ministers to
[2:35:21] come and just pray for each one. The
[2:35:24] Bible says, I am the Lord that health
[2:35:28] thee.
[2:35:29] And the Lord will take away
[2:35:32] from thee all sickness, and he will put
[2:35:35] none of the evil diseases of Egypt,
[2:35:37] which thou knowest upon thee, but a but
[2:35:42] will lay them upon all them that hate
[2:35:44] thee. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and
[2:35:47] all that is within me. Bless his holy
[2:35:49] name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and
[2:35:52] forget not his benefits, who forgiveth
[2:35:55] all thine iniquities, and healeth all
[2:35:57] thy diseases.
[2:35:59] And the church said,
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:04] And Isaiah through the prophet that veil
[2:36:07] uttering, "But he was wounded for our
[2:36:09] transgressions and bruised for our
[2:36:11] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[2:36:14] peace was upon him. And with his
[2:36:16] stripes, can we say it? We are healed."
[2:36:21] Hallelujah.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; With his stripes, we are healed.
[2:36:27] Sickness and disease, we must say it and
[2:36:30] declare it, has no business in the house
[2:36:33] of God.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; And this one, which you know, and is
[2:36:37] usually referred to
[2:36:40] with respect to
[2:36:43] salvation, but I want you to hear it.
[2:36:48] But what saith it?
[2:36:50] The word is nigh thee even in thy mouth
[2:36:54] and in thy heart. That is the word of
[2:36:57] faith which we preach.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; And I have declared today that this word
[2:37:03] has come by none other than the angel of
[2:37:06] the Lord. To me, he's the angel of
[2:37:09] healing.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; He's the angel of his presence.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; He's the angel of his voice.
[2:37:17] Amen.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; And he says, "But the word is nigh thee
[2:37:19] to those that are coming to be prayed
[2:37:21] for." The word is nigh thee in thy
[2:37:23] mouth,
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; and that thou, if thou shalt confess
[2:37:29] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,
[2:37:33] and shalt believe in thine heart
[2:37:36] that God hath raised him from the dead,
[2:37:41] thou shalt be saved. And we take
[2:37:44] salvation as someone come to the altar
[2:37:45] repenting and being saved and they go
[2:37:48] away saved. I thought I will look
[2:37:50] thoroughly at that word and to be saved
[2:37:53] is this.
[2:37:55] It is to make whole
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; to heal
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; and to be whole. Come and make more room
[2:38:03] if you would please.
[2:38:07] to keep safe,
[2:38:14] to be sound,
[2:38:17] to rescue from danger or destruction.
[2:38:20] Listen now closely. And thou shalt be
[2:38:23] saved
[2:38:26] to save a suffering one
[2:38:29] from perishing,
[2:38:31] one suffering from disease. You shall be
[2:38:34] saved from disease.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; You shall be made well.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture says. You
[2:38:42] shall be
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; if you confess. Here it is. It depends
[2:38:48] on what you think about it.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; If you confess with your mouth and
[2:38:53] believe in your heart.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; And I'll say to the church, believe the
[2:38:57] whole council of God. Don't believe just
[2:39:00] one part. Believe the whole council of
[2:39:02] God. I'm here to believe it. It depends
[2:39:04] on what you think it is. Oh,
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, we could have a meeting
[2:39:11] starting right now that wouldn't even
[2:39:12] end. We wouldn't even be done before the
[2:39:15] evening service would start because
[2:39:17] there is that God
[2:39:22] can break on this scene.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; All manner of supernatural things. This
[2:39:30] is supposed to be happening in the house
[2:39:32] of God.
[2:39:34] I believe in the supernatural God that
[2:39:36] led supernaturally.
[2:39:38] Hallelujah. They shall lay hands on the
[2:39:41] sick and they shall recover.
[2:39:44] And if anybody can't believe, dismiss
[2:39:47] yourself. We don't want any hindrance.
[2:39:50] If your heart's not right, either get it
[2:39:52] right or dismiss yourself. We want
[2:39:54] nothing to hinder the power of God in
[2:39:57] this place.
[2:40:00] And you shall be saved. You shall be
[2:40:03] whole. You shall be healed.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; And the word is neither in thy mouth,
[2:40:09] not in my mouth.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; Not in a other minister's mouth, but in
[2:40:14] your mouth. It's nigh thee in thy mouth.
[2:40:16] I believe that this word has been
[2:40:20] identified by the angel of the Lord.
[2:40:23] That is the healing angel. That's the
[2:40:26] angel of his word.
[2:40:30] The promises of God are yay and amen to
[2:40:35] everyone that believeth. It depends on
[2:40:38] what you think about it.
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; To save, to keep sound,
[2:40:47] and to rescue.
[2:40:51] Is that an act showing stretching forth
[2:40:54] thine hand to heal and that signs and
[2:40:57] wonders may be done in the name of thy
[2:41:00] holy child Jesus. There's been a
[2:41:02] backlash against uh signs and wonders
[2:41:05] amongst many message believers. I
[2:41:08] believe in the signs and wonders.
[2:41:11] And like I said,
[2:41:15] when the boat is slipping along nice and
[2:41:19] easy and there's no turbulence, it's
[2:41:22] easy to say, "Well, we don't need it."
[2:41:24] But wait till your boat starts rocking.
[2:41:26] Wait till you start running into it. You
[2:41:29] say, "Oh, God, save me now. What is it
[2:41:31] that you want?" You need a God, a
[2:41:33] supernatural God, a miracle working God.
[2:41:38] Yeah.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; I wish above all things that thou mayest
[2:41:42] prosper and be in health
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; even as thy soul prosperth.
[2:41:50] Now
[2:41:52] hear the mask. Hear the voice coming
[2:41:54] through the mask. The prophet mask. And
[2:41:58] he said, "Now he's veiled in you."
[2:42:01] Listen to me, friends.
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; Who's veiled in you?
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; This same
[2:42:08] same Christ veiled in you. You're the
[2:42:11] mask.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; What are you to be doing as a mask, God?
[2:42:15] You're dwelling in me. And I place my
[2:42:18] heart in faith, hearttohe heart with the
[2:42:21] next one that's next to me and with that
[2:42:23] person that's down in the front, that
[2:42:25] sister that's in that wheelchair. I
[2:42:26] place my heart in faith.
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; I am part of this company. I'm part of
[2:42:32] this body of Christ. I'm part of this
[2:42:34] bride. I'm part of this Exodus group.
[2:42:37] I'm part of the rapture group.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:48] The same one,
[2:42:50] the same one that sent the Lord Jesus
[2:42:52] here by his spoken word. It materialized
[2:42:56] and became the son of God. Died as an
[2:42:59] innocent for the guilty to redeem us
[2:43:01] back to fellowship with God that we
[2:43:04] might we who were once alienated from
[2:43:06] God can now be brought nigh to God by
[2:43:10] the offering of his blood of the
[2:43:12] righteous son of God. We can be brought
[2:43:14] nigh to the sacrifice. Now
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; the prayer of faith
[2:43:25] shall save the sick
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; and the Lord shall raise him up and if
[2:43:31] he have committed sins they shall be
[2:43:34] forgiven him.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; Linda, he came to me.
[2:43:41] He came. or the rod where you come and
[2:43:45] play.
[2:44:01] to

[2:45:28] part.
[2:45:29] Let me reverently now play my part.

[2:45:39] Maybe we've said, "Brother Rod, if you
[2:45:41] would only believe, only believe, all
[2:45:42] things are possible."

[3:13:34] praise and glory.

[3:13:56] Oh, we thank you, Lord.
[3:14:01] &gt;&gt; What a lovely one, Lord.
[3:14:04] What a lovely name.
[3:14:07] The name of Jesus,
[3:14:09] &gt;&gt; the name is above every name.
[3:14:12] And all the hosts of heaven are
[3:14:15] glorifying him. But they have not been
[3:14:18] redeemed. We have been redeemed
[3:14:21] from the pit of sin,
[3:14:23] from the slavery of the enemy.
[3:14:27] Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all
[3:14:31] that is within me. Bless his holy name.
[3:14:34] Hallelujah.
[3:14:36] Hallelujah.

[3:14:50] the Lord. Hallelujah.

[3:15:10] for, do what you could not do. If you
[3:15:12] have some infirmity,
[3:15:16] do what you could not do.
[3:15:19] Hallelujah.
[3:15:20] &gt;&gt; It's time for our sister Heidi neighbor
[3:15:22] to be healed.
[3:15:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[3:15:27] Glory to God.
[3:15:30] We want to hear and see the name of
[3:15:33] Christ lifted up and glorified
[3:15:36] amongst his people. We will give glory
[3:15:38] to none other but to him and him alone.
[3:15:41] He's the only one worthy.
[3:15:46] Oh father,
[3:15:49] our praises and our thanksgiving
[3:15:52] will not cease as we walk from this
[3:15:56] sanctuary.
[3:15:58] But we will continue.
[3:16:00] We will remain in this atmosphere.
[3:16:03] We will come under a glory cloud this
[3:16:05] evening. Oh God, we thank you for your
[3:16:09] We came Lord and you have answered. We
[3:16:12] came Lord with questions. You've
[3:16:14] answered them. We've come with physical
[3:16:16] needs, Lord. We came hobbling up here.
[3:16:19] We came, oh God, with our suffering and
[3:16:21] our pain. But we can say Jesus paid it
[3:16:24] all.
[3:16:27] &gt;&gt; And when you spoke those priceless
[3:16:29] words, it is finished. There is nothing
[3:16:32] we could add to it. We don't have to try
[3:16:35] to conjure up something. We don't have
[3:16:37] to receive it in some emotional. But oh
[3:16:40] God, we are emotional now. We're happy
[3:16:42] now. We're praising you, oh God, and and
[3:16:45] we'll continue to praise you till the
[3:16:46] finished work is completed.
[3:16:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:16:52] &gt;&gt; Glory be to the son of God.
[3:16:56] &gt;&gt; Be with us, Lord, as we depart from this
[3:17:00] place that we may return after a short
[3:17:04] time of refreshment and rest.
[3:17:08] Let you speak what you would have spoken
[3:17:10] to us, Lord, tonight through your
[3:17:13] servant
[3:17:15] in Jesus Christ's name. We want to know
[3:17:18] we love you.
[3:17:21] We love you
[3:17:23] and we thank you. We thank you for
[3:17:26] coming to us.
[3:17:30] Hallelujah.
[3:17:33] Hallelujah.
[3:17:35] I love him. I love him. And with that we
[3:17:37] are dismissed
[3:17:39] and we'll go quietly and reverently.
[3:17:42] I
[3:17:45] love him.
[3:17:49] I
[3:17:52] love him
[3:17:56] because
[3:17:59] he first
[3:18:02] love
[3:18:04] me.
[3:18:09] And
[3:18:14] my
[3:18:15] sh
[3:18:43] Amen. You're dismissed.
