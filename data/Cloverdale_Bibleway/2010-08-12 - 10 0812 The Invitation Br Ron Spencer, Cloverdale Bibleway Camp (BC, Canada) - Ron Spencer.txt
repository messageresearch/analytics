Oh, welcome Holy Spirit. Yes, Lord. We are in your presence. Fill us with your power.

Oh, fill us with your power. Live inside of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, that's our desire tonight. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; I just want to make a few comments before we pray. And uh I'm going to be asking brother Tim Dodd to come and lead us in prayer and ask uh God's not merely his blessing. We want his perfect will. &gt;&gt; Brother Dodd in in this meeting. There's been a lot of prayer that's gone up. We've been praying. They've been praying in the prayer meetings and people have been praying individually at home. We've been praying that there be a holy holy blanket &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit, a holy cloud upon this entire gathering. And all that happens here is for his praise &gt;&gt; and his glory. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to have you take your seats for a few moments. There's three things that we're here for. And one is I and I would like each of you to be able to say this within yourself that you could in agreement say I'm here for this purpose. Uh this is my prayer and these are words that I spoke to the Lord before the service tonight and I I feel that they are they are words that we could all agree with and make it our prayer. We are here tonight to hear words of God. &gt;&gt; We are here tonight to give ourselves unreservedly &gt;&gt; to his purpose and his will. &gt;&gt; And we are here tonight Not just this evening, but we're here to encourage one another and to edify someone else. We want to be spiritually productive. &gt;&gt; And we don't know what that might be, just a word. It may be just your presence, the fact that you are here. The fact that you're not somewhere else, but you're here will be an encouragement to someone else. I've been speaking to brother Ron Spencer just about his how he feels about the service. He said they came from Edmonton. He said they had one of the most special times uh in in services in Edmonton and uh I just felt it was no doubt in preparation for us here. We've come with great expectation &gt;&gt; and as you said tonight, brother Roy, and it really touched my heart. You don't know if you've ever felt a greater expectation &gt;&gt; and I think that all of us can ask, "Father, give us such an expectation so that we are pulling on the ministry of the word." &gt;&gt; There's two things that are happening at the same time in a meeting like this. And I just want to bring it to your attention before we go on in the service because I wanted to welcome everyone that has come and some have come from some long distances but we're so happy that you're here. &gt;&gt; And uh we have felt to really turn these meeting not into so much a youth camp. This is a family camp. &gt;&gt; Mothers and fathers are here. Families are here. and I've heard already from several. It is so wonderful just to be able to mingle with uh the people that are able to be here as families uh and some that were here during during the junior camp. They have just uh stayed on for the for this next four days and I think it's just wonderful. But the two things that are happening at the same time, brother Brandham spoke of the time this message which he was bringing is is a jubilee message. And at the time and he referred to the in the Old Testament that there was a time of Jubilee when a a trumpet was being blown. A sound was coming was being made. And at that sound you could do one of two things. You could go free &gt;&gt; or you could stay in your slavery. &gt;&gt; And slavery is really uh there it can be a lot of things. We could just be enslaved to our own our own idea, our own complex or or our sickness or to uh who knows what or our sin or whatever more our flesh ourself. But tonight I believe and I I feel this very very strong upon my heart tonight as brother Ron Spencer comes to speak. I believe that he is ordained of God for this moment. The trumpet sound of the message has already sounded &gt;&gt; and we all at some time or other I expect have heard it and you upon hearing the sound you can do one of two things. You can accept it, believe it and be free. I mean free &gt;&gt; not in a word f re e e but you can be free. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or you can just stay the way you are. And brother Brandham said that person who just wanted to stay, they would get bore with an all in their ear and then they couldn't hardly hear anything else. And I'd like to take this moment and just read this read this quote before we pray. He said, "Notice the Messiah standing in the platform to identify himself with the word of promise for that age." &gt;&gt; And tonight, the Messiah, not brother Ron Spencer, but the word that is preached is the Messiah. &gt;&gt; The Messiah, I want to announce to you, the Messiah will be here at the platform this evening. Furthermore, I'll say the Messiah is at the platform. &gt;&gt; He said, "How strange the Messiah standing up before the church and look at these precious words when he says here to preach the acceptable year, the acceptable year of the Lord." And he said, "The acceptable year of Jubilee, when the all slaves and prisoners, no matter how long they've been in bondage, &gt;&gt; or how long they were supposed to stay there, when the year come uh of the Jubilee, when the trumpet sounded, &gt;&gt; every man, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; could go free &gt;&gt; if he wanted to go free. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're free. &gt;&gt; You were no more a slave. &gt;&gt; But if you desired to remain a slave, &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; said if you desired to remain a slave, then you had to go and be taken to the temple to the temple post and have your ear with an all board. He said, "What a perfect example." Now, folks, we're not just here having this family camp service. I feel if that's what we're here for, it's a failure. &gt;&gt; We're here for a different purpose. &gt;&gt; We're here because God sent a message and there is no other message like it. &gt;&gt; There's no other message that's had this kind of vindication. When the when the messenger of this evening, brother Spencer, comes and stands behind this pulpit, just remember one thing. He is speaking on the basis and his authority is from a message that God vindicated. That's why I say the Messiah &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; God vindicated. And a prophet says, "What a perfect example it is of the gospel of Jesus Christ when it's preached, the acceptable time and the time of Jubilee." And I thought tonight, I wonder, Lord, there's going to be a jubilee for somebody. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody, no matter who you are, &gt;&gt; what color you are, what denomination you belong to, how far you've been stopped, how far you've stooped in sin, or what's wrong with you. You can go free when you hear God's gospel trumpet sound. You are free. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you turn your back upon the message, that's the two things. &gt;&gt; You are free. That's number one. &gt;&gt; But if you turn your back on the message, he said if you turn your back on the message and refuse to hear it, notice he says you're bored in the air with an all. And that means to say that you've crossed the line between grace and judgment and you will never hear the gospel again. And he said, "You never get any further. You must be a slave to the system." &gt;&gt; Sometimes the system is just our own system. &gt;&gt; Don't have any preconceived idea tonight. &gt;&gt; We're not here to have any special kind of, you know, whip up. &gt;&gt; We're not We're not here to have a bunch of emotionalism. We're here to have you prepared to hear the Messiah. You believe it's the Messiah? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It is indeed. And I'd like to sing. Brother Ryan, if you would please. Set I found. Would you do that? And then, Brother Tim Dodd, if you would come, we have three uh urgent burdens or uh two very urgent in fact. Brother Gay, our sister Barb Drake's father uh has perhaps one week or two weeks to live. And uh tonight uh two of the daughters, Sister Barb sisters, left this morning to go to be with him. And so we want to pray for brother Gay that God's will, perfect will be done. And this is what we're asking. We just don't want him to suffer. If God's to take him at this time, then may he go in peace. &gt;&gt; And if he's to remain, may he be restored quickly. &gt;&gt; Sister Litty, if she was sitting here this evening, you would admire her. She's a wonderful sister. She may be streaming the meeting this evening. Uh she's in Switzerland and uh she and her husband Daniel have been very very instrumental in the meetings. uh in Switzerland and she does a lot of work just like some of the young sisters around here. She has some kind of muscular thing. The doctors can't discover what it is. And I sent him an email today and I said it might hide from the doctors. That's what the prophet said. But it can't hide from God. Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; God bless our sister Lyd with a healing. Brother Tim, as you pray, brother Jim Weber, he had a bit of an accident today. He was not hurt. We're thankful for that. But he got bumped around and the brakes failed in his truck and the truck rolled over. We understand. But he's he's fine. But he's got uh you can't have a something like that happen without it being, you know, shaking you up a bit. So we want to pray for brother Jim and God will just be near him. And then there's been uh some have gotten sick here at the camp and we just know that the enemy, he hates what we're doing. And so we want to pray that God will just overshadow this camp. And brother Tim, if you would come while we sing this chorus, please. &gt;&gt; Said love that. Would you stand please? said, "I found some struggle my weakness." Oh, I found grace to cover all my sins. It's in Jesus. It's in Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. foundation is in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we pray? Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, how we love you. Lord, &gt;&gt; how we thank you, Father, that you are the center of our lives. &gt;&gt; Lord, you have quickened us to that fact. And &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe that everybody here in this room, you are the center of their life. But Father, it may be &gt;&gt; that some have not been quickened to that fact yet. They have not been quickened that Lord, you were in they were in your mind before the foundation of the world. Lord, maybe this is their night. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, may you draw near unto us tonight. Lord, may you draw near unto us in these meetings as has been requested, Father. Lord, may you take, Lord, one thing we would request, Father, is we would see your sovereignty, Lord, for you are sovereign, oh God. &gt;&gt; And Lord, let the mind of man be uh put to shame and let the mind of Christ be exalted in these meetings, in this weekend. Lord, we welcome you to have the preeminence. And Lord, we're needy people, oh God. Lord, you know our hearts. Oh, Father, we thank you that you know our hearts. You know the secrets that we don't have to put it on paper. We don't have to make our requests understandable by our words. Because many times, Father, we would fail with our words to express to you. But Lord, you know the deepest regions of our lives and our needs, our burdens, our desires. Lord, our yearnings towards you, as has been said this morning, our groanings, oh God. Lord, I pray that you'll meet every groaning, every yearning, Lord. Every burden, every question, Lord. And Lord, there's some needs tonight very specific and urgent, Lord. It would it wouldn't have been mentioned if they weren't urgent, Father. And Lord, we're remembering our brother Gay tonight. Lord, we're asking Lord for your perfect will in his life. Lord, &gt;&gt; we ask, oh God, that you'd your hand would be upon him for your will to be done. Lord, if it be to take him home, your will, Father, we we are not their sorrow as them that have no hope, Lord. But Lord, we know you have a purpose in all things. But Lord, if it be your will that he would stay with us, raise him up, Father. Lord, we're asking, oh God, that you'll sovereignly touch him &gt;&gt; for your perfect will to be done. We ask, Lord, for the sister, Lord, that the devil has tried to hide. He is a defeated foe. Lord, you paid the price for all healing 2,000 years ago. Lord, in your mind, it's a finished work. And we accept the mind of Christ tonight. May our sister accept it. And Lord, may she be completely loosed even now. Father, may the enemy be driven from her, Lord. As your scripture says, even if there be any sin, she might not even know, Lord, may it be forgiven her, Lord. Lord, let your grace rest upon her life. &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask for our brother that's been in the accident, Father. Lord, you know him, Lord. Let him be loosed, Father, from every upset and every ill feeling, oh God. Lord, may he have perfect liberty, oh God. May he walk away now perfectly clear in conscience, in mind, in body. And Lord, may you just give him that that uh blessing upon his life that he needs at this time of the urgency. So we commit ourselves to you. We commit the song service. We commit brother Spencer to you Lord because Lord we want father that you will use him for our benefit and for the glory of the name of Jesus Christ. We ask it in that holy name, the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you. You can have your seats. We're just going to prepare to take the offering. Our brother Tom's going to come. And just as we prepare to do that, why don't we sing, I just want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. Aren't you thankful that you've heard? &gt;&gt; You think of all the people in the earth. There's a chosen few, and God saw fit to let us be a part of that. How can you have a bad day when you think about that? Amen. So, let's sing this. I just want to thank you, Lord. Oh, I just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your word. What have I done to deserve such glory reveal in me for that special to And I just want you to s for that special when I saw your glorious face to face with eternal life. &gt;&gt; One more time. I just want to thank you Lord. I just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your word. What have I done to you for that special face with eternal life? Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; We're coming to the time of the offering. &gt;&gt; Well, you can look at it one or two ways. You can take you can keep playing. You can take it look like it's maybe some sort of burden or you can make it a love offering &gt;&gt; to the Lord. There's always two types of people in the world. There's givers and there's takers. You say, "Well, I just came to camp, show up, and I want the blessing." &gt;&gt; Well, I could be a taker, but I want to do the giving tonight, saints. I want to give everything that I can. I have come here to meet the living God. And I know he's poured out everything and has given everything to us that we might benefit his glory and grace. &gt;&gt; And so we come to an offering. It shouldn't be, oh, there's an offering and say, "Oh, God, this is a part of worship. Let me give my offering. &gt;&gt; Let me give my offering. Whatever I can do for the kingdom, young people, we need to learn this. &gt;&gt; This is a a love offering to the Lord." and that there are of course expenses that come with meetings, but Lord, we want to give it back to you. You've given so much to me, and I'm expecting that God's going to pour down his grace and open the windows of heaven upon my soul. Can I do my part of worship? And can I give a little something back to you, Lord? Don't be a taker only. Why don't you be a giver tonight? And thank God that you have an opportunity, young people. Let's just bow our heads and ask the Lord to bless this offering tonight. Father, how we have prayed and saints have laid on their face. Parents have sacrificed. I would say they're not the takers, they're the givers. They've given much. They've sacrificed their lives, their time, and now we're here in this wonderful setting. We have wondered people, the redeemed of God. And so, Lord, this is going to be an offering that we we give. Would you bless the giver, Lord Jesus, that you will take this offering and multiply it abundantly for the kingdom of God. We thank you for everyone that is here. So, Lord, we're just praying now that your grace and your blessing be upon each and everyone now at this time. In Jesus' name, we give you thanks. Amen. God bless you as you give. Amen. Light of the world, you step down into darkness. Open my eyes. Let me see. For such beauty that makes this heart adore you. Joy of the lives with you. Oh here I am to worship. Here I am to bow. Here I am to see that you're my God. Oh, you're all together. All together worthy. All together king of all so highly exalted your glorious in The earth that you created for me. Heat. Heat. Heat. Never know just how much it cost to see my Oh my god. Heat. Heat. Heat. together. All together you're all together. Here I am. Oh, here I am. Here I am to here. I am to see that my You're all together. All together we see just once more. Here I am to worship. Here I am. Heat. Heat. Heat. together. Just sing one more time. Worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God. All together wonder here I am to worship sweetly now. Here I am to Here I am to say that you're my God. You're all together lovely. All together worthy all together wonder. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, that's why we've come here tonight, oh God. Lord, to give of ourselves, oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just want to worship you tonight, oh God, in spirit and in truth, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, from the depths of our souls, there's such a desire and a craving, oh God. Lord, that you would be exalted, &gt;&gt; that you would be made manifest in our midst tonight. Oh God, &gt;&gt; come, oh God, we pray, Lord, &gt;&gt; blessed be your name, oh Jesus. Hallelujah. We don't want to interrupt this atmosphere. Oh Lord, we just want to sing a song for you before we turn to the word tonight. Just invite you to worship along with us. Those of you that know it, please just sing along with us. God bless you. You can have your seats. I slipped through the gates of pearl as Peter greed me. And one by one I met the saints I'd long so much to see. I saw my hero Steven, Paul and Timothy. But before my breath could find the words, I heard them speak to me. Are you she the bride of the last days who stood the worst of times when so many slipped away. Here's your crown. Take your place beside the throne. Christ is now your very own. Is this the special chosen one we see? Are you was the worst of all the ages. They continue to say, "How did you live a Christian life in such a godless day?" But question after question my heroes lifted me and I heard a voice behind me whisper tenderly is she the bride of the last days who stood the worst of times when so many slipped away. Here's your crown to take your place beside the throne. I am now your very own. This is the special chosen one we see for the chosen one. This is she. These trials that you're facing may seem so big and tall, but when we hear the master speak, it'll make it worth it all. Worth it all. You worship the ride of the last days. The worst time when so many slipp away your praise. Christ is now your very own. This is the special chosen one. You're the chosen one. You worship. You worship. Wonderful. Thank you for that wonderful song. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For the hours you've taken or practicing. God bless you. We're going to turn to the word. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, not only thank you for coming, we thank God for sparing this man. &gt;&gt; Not once, but more than we believe that God spared you for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Besides your people at home, but for us &gt;&gt; and for tonight, folks, &gt;&gt; I believe that God has given him words. I do believe that God has given them words. I have no idea what he's going to speak on, but I'm taking it to myself. I want to hear words from heaven, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; I want to consecrate myself a new. &gt;&gt; I want to be a blessing to someone else. Come, brother Ron. Take your liberty &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Amen. We love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's certainly good to us, isn't he? &gt;&gt; We are. We're so thrilled just to be here. I would term it one of the highest honors in the whole world, just to be able to stand here with you. And uh we love you with all of our hearts. But the reason we're all here is to serve him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't felt the presence of the Lord here already this afternoon, you're numb. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you would stand with me this evening, I'd like to just go directly to the word. And so glad to have Sister Connie with me and then my daughter, Sister Whitney and Sister Autumn from our church. And so good to see each and every one of you friends. And uh what a family reunion we have here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just a just a real time in the Lord. How many has come under expectation for this week &gt;&gt; that the Lord Jesus would come to you? &gt;&gt; We've come with an expectation, Lord, before this week is over. &gt;&gt; We'd like to spend just a little time with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I I stood yesterday at an hour at an airport counter waiting for a man just to look up an hour. I watched my watch. He was very diligent not to look up at all. And I waited cuz I was as patient as he was patient not looking at me. But our Lord Jesus is waiting on us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And let's just invite him to where we're at just now. &gt;&gt; May he come and speak to our hearts and anoint our lips. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; Lord, this meeting has been set aside and much work has went in. But Lord, we realize that we're the physical attributes of God that you thought of before the foundation of the world. And there is a gathering that's going on here even this afternoon. &gt;&gt; And Lord, you know exactly what our needs are. &gt;&gt; You know exactly what the conditions are in our lives. &gt;&gt; And you know, Father, what we're struggling with and what we're fighting. &gt;&gt; But Lord, the answer to every one of our problems is more of you. Lord, if you would just come tonight, &gt;&gt; forgive us of our sins, &gt;&gt; our mistakes. Father, &gt;&gt; I have no one to blame, but Lord, I ask you that you would forgive me, dear God. Lord, if you would just come and anoint these lips one more time and this body, Father, we come to this predestinated moment. And we ask you that you would anoint our lives, Lord, for the service of your kingdom. &gt;&gt; Not just as a speaker, but also as a hearer, Father. And wherever these words would echo, Lord, tonight, I pray that they would reach their mark, dear God. May they be effective, Father. Lord, these are your words. And I ask you that you would just minister to us. Bridle our tongues. Bridle our minds tonight, Lord. Lord, those that have traveled so far and their bodies may be weary. May you refresh them in your presence tonight. Help us, we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen. And amen. Amen. If you will turn with me in your scriptures this afternoon to Luke chapter 7 this evening. Luke 7 and verse 36. And I would like to look this afternoon at the invitation if I could this afternoon. Luke 7 and verse 36. And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet. And behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at me in the Pharisees house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, and stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with ointment. And when the Pharisee which had been bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touched him." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; For she is a sinner. You may be seated this evening. Brother Brandham uses this text in many different places and for many different purposes and I would like to just spend just a few moments with it this afternoon. And brother Brandham said that our Lord Jesus was possibly up on a heel heaven meeting and no doubt he was had delivered some words of maybe from even the biatitudes. Blessed is the pouring spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. and hundreds and maybe even thousands had gathered on this hill to to be be a part of this ministry. And they were watching the word become made flesh. And no doubt as they were there and many were sick were just pressing their way to where he was at. And as they were going, as they were working their way, maybe if they could just get a time with him and they could just press their way to where he's at. if they could get a disciple's attention, you know, pray for my mother, pray for my brother, pray for me, I have incredible need, anything that they could do to get close to him. &gt;&gt; They just wanted his eyes to fall upon them &gt;&gt; that their need could be met. &gt;&gt; The more they saw, the more their faith rose. &gt;&gt; Now, there was another young man that was headed towards this meeting. He was a courier. He had a message. He had a cause to be here. And now he has a he has a boss that has is arranging a great gayla, a great dinner. He's invited the celebrities of all of the city and as of any of these events, he's he's got the social gatherings and everything and everything's going to be perfectly set up. But on this occasion, brother Tim, he wants to invite Jesus of Nazareth. &gt;&gt; He has a purpose. He has an agenda &gt;&gt; in his mind to bring him there. &gt;&gt; And so he sends out this courier and and brother Brandham says he would run for maybe days looking and searching the heels and searching where he may have been and searching for testimony of if the Jesus had been there and he was just doing whatever he could to get to where he was at. And as he comes towards the meeting, he's very he's very impatient. He's making his way. And brother man said, "I can see him." And excuse me, I just I just want to be a repeater here just for a little while. Brother man says, "I can see him as he as he makes his way towards towards Jesus." And he said, "The disciples see him coming and they stop him." And they stopping and maybe want to know his business and and he begins to tell him in quite an excited for fashion of of Jesus of Nazareth now has been invited to to the to this Pharisees house. And what an honor it would be for Jesus to come. And it would and it would no doubt that if Jesus would come, you know, he's he's bringing him the greatest invitation that he could possibly bring Jesus to be able to come and set at meet at this great celebration that is getting ready to take place. Not knowing really who he was inviting, &gt;&gt; not knowing what was really getting ready to take place. Come on, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham. I especially today I heard him say this courier had an opportunity &gt;&gt; with the Lord &gt;&gt; and his cause was more important &gt;&gt; than taking the opportunity with the Lord Jesus for the greater purpose. &gt;&gt; His boss's cause, the invitation was more important than getting what he really needed. I pray that in this meeting &gt;&gt; that we have come with the right purpose &gt;&gt; that we have come that when he comes on the scene to where we're at &gt;&gt; that we take this opportunity &gt;&gt; whether we're young or the oldest in this building to draw nearer to him. No doubt Peter being the way that he was and his disposition the way it was, he just kind of kind of shoved him aside. There's more important pressing things here already formulated in his mind maybe speaking with Andrew. No way that the Lord will go. No way the Lord will go. He's he's busy about this and and I can see as this courier, he's just waiting for his opportunity to step up. And when it comes his time, he steps up and he begins to deliver this great witness that he's getting ready to do that you're invited to come at a certain time. You to come and be with us and so and so is going to be there and so and so is going to be there and we want to have you as a guest there. And he begins to deliver it with all of his heart. And no doubt others are sitting waiting for him to be rebuked and he says, "I'll come. I'll come. &gt;&gt; He's going to a place that he calls f their fathers devils. &gt;&gt; He calls them hypocrites. &gt;&gt; Whited supplers. &gt;&gt; Now he's getting ready to go to their place where they're at. No doubt in their own mind they cannot understand even what is the purpose of why he's even going. &gt;&gt; Here is much business to be done. Here is a people that love him. Here's a people that are just looking for the opportunity just get near him. Now he's going to leave this scene and he's going to go to this great social occasion. But you see as a man we can't see what's going on. We can't see what God is gathering in another dimension. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can't even understand how he gathers this one and gathers this one. And and maybe we don't even understand even why we're here this evening. But God in his infinite mind &gt;&gt; knows exactly how to pull us all together to speak to one person. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can see as the scene is beginning to set in the &gt;&gt; brother said this little girl from the city. She goes out and the streets are empty. Just down in a certain place where this is all to be set at. There are chariots gathering and and men gathering with all different kinds of thing and great work has went into this evening and they've gathered there and all the socialites. All the people that are called the who's who &gt;&gt; the people that are supposed to be impressed with other people and and eyes on humanity. They've gathered and they're just so thrilled that they can have their socialite reunion, you know, and they're tipping their wine glasses and talking about their businesses and and what's going on in the community and no doubt politics is coming up and no doubt as each one would gather as the red carpet would be, they might have an announcer there and and he calls out so and so is here. Dr. Jones is here. &gt;&gt; The great lawyer is here and they're gathering and no doubt hand applause goes and then they would come to the footwash flunky and they would get a new robe and they would get a perfume and they'd get washed up. There'd be great announcement and incredible welcoming that would go on and it was a special committee set up to take care of this welcoming. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And as they're gathering, no doubt they're making sure that one another's gathering. You going or you going or you going? Well, it'll be a special time. &gt;&gt; And now now the disciples are also coming. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They're walking with the master. &gt;&gt; No doubt some gravels are being kicked and dirt being kicked wondering why he's even going. &gt;&gt; They're making their way. It's not just a normal little jaunt down the road, but they're making their way to where where this place is at. And they're walking and the master's just walking among them, maybe maybe even just kind of just very quietly moving. And as he's going, there's a purpose of why he's going. &gt;&gt; There's a purpose of why he's going. outside the street is full of people. Brother B said poor people gathering looking to see who's there. Maybe a little food will be handed out once everybody begins to be drunken and and maybe lambs and meat. And he said the air is filled with spices and you could just smell it, the anticipation, the excitement of the event. And now Jesus is making his way towards where they're at. Their heads are not so turned when he walks into their midst, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; As he begins to make his way, maybe rubbing shoulders with one another and kind of moving through. His name isn't called as they he begins to get to the entrance. The disciples now can't go with him. He makes his way in. The footwash flunky avoids him with everything that's within him. And you can tell when you're being avoided. &gt;&gt; You know, there's just something about the spirit of rejection that just falls. And the atmosphere is literally literally charged with rejection and feelings. And you know, our humanity plays in that order. And Jesus is having to feel this as he makes his way. But he's got purpose. And you see, you know, he he didn't come for to be applauded by men. Now, &gt;&gt; they came to be applauded by men. &gt;&gt; And listen, listen. There's objectives. We're not here to be praised by man. &gt;&gt; We're here to praise God. &gt;&gt; He begins to make his way through the through the scene and spectators are looking and why is he even here? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he can hear the moans and the groans from the people and the rejection and &gt;&gt; and he can hear them. Look at there. Why? He's came and they didn't even give him a robe. They didn't wash his feet. No doubt outside there. They're making mention. Look what's happening now. As he makes his way, he's he looks for a spot and he settles himself in a corner and a corner over by side and he's kind of just sitting there scanning the room. Listen. Our all knowing Messiah &gt;&gt; sitting there &gt;&gt; patiently waiting. &gt;&gt; There's a pull. There's a leading. &gt;&gt; As he's beginning to scan the room, he's watching for the purpose of why I'm here. &gt;&gt; Because he's did what his promise was to keep his appointments. He keeps them all. &gt;&gt; He goes wherever he's invited. There's great work by humanity that's went into this event, but they really don't know that they were orchestrated by God to bring in a predestinated seat. &gt;&gt; As he begins to set, no doubt now there's no drinks handed his way. There's no orderves handed his way. There's no food handed his way. I'm sure as the as as they're talking once among another they're kind of looking over their shoulders seeing him over there dusty clothes and no doubt no doubt he's been very weary from the journey and they're watching him and they're kind of making small talk and laughing and saying different things about him. &gt;&gt; Now let's just look through his eyes just for a few moments. cuz these eyes have met some of these same people &gt;&gt; it was these kind of people that brought a little woman one day &gt;&gt; to tempt him &gt;&gt; and they they had it they had a law that this woman should be stoned &gt;&gt; and as they brought him there they brought this woman listen they broke their own law they should have brought the man and the woman. &gt;&gt; But they they came and they brought this woman. Now the scripture says that Jesus spoke to them, "He that is without sin, cast the first stone." &gt;&gt; He doesn't speak an incredibly long sermon to them, &gt;&gt; but just his mere presence, &gt;&gt; brings a conviction on them. Listen, they could go to church and didn't feel that kind of conviction. &gt;&gt; They could go to their synagogues and read the the the script of Ezekiel and Jeremiah and stand in the temple all day long with their allas and and their their their their sacrifices. &gt;&gt; But this man has a presence about him. &gt;&gt; This man's got an atmosphere about him. This man literally he literally commands a presence about him. &gt;&gt; He simply says he that is without sin &gt;&gt; cast the first stone. &gt;&gt; Now these people call themselves the holiest of holy people. &gt;&gt; Why? They no doubt carry their own records and their own their own their own sorceries and and everything about them and they they consider themselves holier, the the stock of Israel. &gt;&gt; But only a few days ago, the prophet stood on the banks of a Jordan and is telling them that your sacrifices are not much longer going to be accepted. Right? &gt;&gt; Because there's one cometh, &gt;&gt; the lamb of God &gt;&gt; that will take away the sins of the world. &gt;&gt; There's coming a time when you won't need to offer up lambs and turtles, doves, and you won't have to identify yourself with that sacrifice anymore. &gt;&gt; But God sending a kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The one that can erase sins forever &gt;&gt; by one offering. &gt;&gt; Listen, I can hear John as he preaches it with a revelation in his heart and sent to introduce that one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saw the hypocrisy in the church. &gt;&gt; He saw there was no reality. He saw there was no life. and God's getting ready to change that whole order of that &gt;&gt; all the way from Adam coming out of the Garden of Eden. Listen, I just read brother Brandham said God spoke to Adam and said not only did he cast them out, he said, but God even said, "I'll go with you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's a woman in her condition, not denying her condition. &gt;&gt; Here's a woman in her condition, standing there before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he begins to write on the sand. The scripture says they were convicted by their own conscience. &gt;&gt; And here's here he is sitting in the corner. and he's standing in the room and he's watching. That same kind of gift was in Misha Walker &gt;&gt; and there was a real Christian and there was a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; That same gift was set in in standing prayer lines. Right. &gt;&gt; And look at a man say, "You're wanting this the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; if you'll take the tobaca out of your left back pocket &gt;&gt; of your inner pants. &gt;&gt; You're wearing two pair of pants of your inner pants. You've hid that. If you'll get rid of that tobaca, God will give you the Holy Ghost." That same mechc &gt;&gt; that talked to Abraham, &gt;&gt; that's the same one that was sitting in the room. &gt;&gt; And he was sitting and he was staring looking at these so-called Pharisees, religious men, &gt;&gt; that was looking for a Messiah &gt;&gt; that had an order in their mind of what he would be like. And he was there. &gt;&gt; He was sitting there. and they were missing it. &gt;&gt; Now, there's another little girl. She's she's a part of this scene. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; And she she goes down the street, &gt;&gt; she sees the gayla going on, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; She spots in there what's going on. No doubt she can see through a certain place. And she can sense. She's consented some things. No doubt some of those men have been at her house. &gt;&gt; Listen, she knew what reality was. &gt;&gt; Those those men, those religious men, they didn't have reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But she too had heard rumors &gt;&gt; about this one. And she saw something in him sitting there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there was a deep calling on the inside of her. &gt;&gt; Maybe she was like maybe one of you sitting here. She had tried many times in her life to reform her life &gt;&gt; and to resurrect her life and try to raise up and be a better person. &gt;&gt; Maybe she had tried it on her own energies. &gt;&gt; Maybe she had tried within herself to raise herself up. But let me just say this to you. Only God can reach down and raise us up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There was something on the inside of her calling out. &gt;&gt; Listen, there was something there. Sin didn't satisfy. The things of the world didn't satisfy. Listen, all of the debauchery and everything that was that that was around her. None of that satisfied her life. I will tell you sin has a thirst that listen no matter how far you go in it cannot be quenched. &gt;&gt; Lust only gets worse. &gt;&gt; Greed only gets worse. &gt;&gt; Immorality only gets worse. Perversion only gets worse. &gt;&gt; You're sitting here tonight and you say, "Well, Brother Ron, I you know I You know, I I I I'm not such a bad person. Let me just say what a target that we are without the spirit of God in our life for the devil to destroy. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown met some people on Peg Alley. He would ask him, "How did you get here?" Maybe a president, a man sitting there, it was an alcoholic &gt;&gt; and he would he would ask him, "How did you get here?" Right? &gt;&gt; Well, I was the president of the bank. I I I I was very successful, but I began to take a little social drink. He never thought it would make him wind up there. &gt;&gt; He never thought of where it would take him. Maybe maybe if we could just come to today visiting the wrong internet site. We never thought of where it would take us. &gt;&gt; Chatting with the wrong person. We never thought where it would take us. Samson never believed getting in bad company. &gt;&gt; Would wind him up at a meal blind, &gt;&gt; churning corn, &gt;&gt; being spit on by little kids, &gt;&gt; being at the very center of a city, grinding at a meal. And let me just say, every one of us, if we're not careful, are targets of an enemy that would like to have us grinding at a meal. Satan will offer us a whole lot of things. Forgive me for just going this way just for a few minutes. Just felt very led of the Lord to do this. Satan will offer you jobs that'll take you away from church. &gt;&gt; He'll offer you friendships that'll take you away from church. &gt;&gt; He'll take you He'll offer you relationships that'll take you away from the presence of God. He'll bring you under the influence of humanity that will pull you from the presence of the Lord. Examine your friendships. &gt;&gt; Examine your relationships. &gt;&gt; If they're not drawing you closer to God, are you with me now? If they're not drawing you closer to God, examine and leave those things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, examine your own attitude as you come to church. Are you really getting what you need? &gt;&gt; Is it just churchity that is bringing you sitting on a pew? Is it just because your mother and father are here? Is it just because your family's here? &gt;&gt; If you remember, Cain was a He was a religious man. &gt;&gt; He built an altar. &gt;&gt; He did incredible amount of work to make it just right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Well, he was religious. He wanted to do the very best job that he could do. But brother Brown said, "Watch his attitude." &gt;&gt; When God didn't accept his sacrifice, he had an attitude. You can't. That's the best that I've got. Take it or leave it. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. If we're not careful, we'll refuse to move on. &gt;&gt; We'll refuse to step to a higher calling. Brother Ron, I've got it made. Let me just say this to you. We're not in the rapture just yet. Every service we should draw closer to him. &gt;&gt; Every service we should be looking for the voice that is behind the voice. God speak to my heart. &gt;&gt; God anoint us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let this camp meeting be a complete different camp meeting. Not because I'm speaking, not because these other brothers are speaking, but listen and grab a hold of that voice, &gt;&gt; that presence that is in this building. &gt;&gt; Whether you're a minister, &gt;&gt; no matter who you are, &gt;&gt; listen, every one of us must be challenged. We need more of him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No doubt. No doubt this woman had been offered religion. I shared with the church the other day, Sunday night, I just I just felt just completely moved by God to go back and and just speak. And I'll just share this with you. I was raised in the message. My father was a preacher. He was here a couple of years ago with me. He's very Holy Ghost man fil man. I was raised listening to the the prophet's message every day. I heard it every day. My brother and I could quote it would stand and quote brother Brandham. See who could quote the best. I played a drum in the church from the time I was seven years old. We went to church every week, two, three, four, five services a week. I saw incredible miracles take place, phenomenal miracles, heard incredible preaching, but that didn't save me. &gt;&gt; Going to church all of that much, it didn't save me. My dad believed what brother Brown said, you be their Holy Ghost until they get it for themselves. &gt;&gt; He believed it with all of his heart. Oh, I walk to an altar a time or two and and just just because others kind of pull me there &gt;&gt; because I was supposed to and I began to get led under the influence of friends the wrong direction even within the church it be kind of to lead lead me they were whirly and and for some reason because I didn't have the new earth began to lead me in the wrong direction. And I could say from that time &gt;&gt; from that time it went from maybe leaving service and going out while the service was going on and and then getting back in time to play music. I'm sorry. Maybe smoking a joint while I was out and then getting back. It wasn't long until I was a drug addict. It wasn't long till I was doing the wrong thing. But I knew no matter how far in sin I went, I knew &gt;&gt; I knew there was something real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Friend took me to a Baptist church and I said and I listened and he was a tall man and he he looked down at me. He said, "Ron, don't you want to go to the altar?" Incredible speaker. I said, "No, no, I don't want to go to the altar. Not here. &gt;&gt; Not here. &gt;&gt; This ain't the spot. &gt;&gt; Another friend took me to a Pentecostal church. You need this run. He tricked me and I went I heard a friend of mine preach and he stood and he preached. His name was Mike and he stood and he preached. He came down the aisle and he he literally got in front of me. Don't you want to come to the altar? No. &gt;&gt; No. because I knew where there was something real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was now past 21 years old, just about coming on 22. And I told my grandma, who was quite a curser, she can make a Navy Seal, blush. Stood all 5 foot tall, weighed about 240 lbs, got every bit of my height height from her. And I'll never forget, we were sitting at the table one night and it was it was it was a Saturday evening and she said, "They invited us to church." I said, "You need to go." She said, "You need to go with me." And we went and the man got up and he began to speak. And that presence that I had been running from. &gt;&gt; That presence I'd been running from now met me. &gt;&gt; And as I sat there, I couldn't pay attention to the words the mans were saying because there was a presence in the room now. And now I knew I knew without a shadow of a doubt. Now this is more than a man that's speaking to my heart. &gt;&gt; But this is God. And I'm very much aware that God anoints men. &gt;&gt; He will change their thoughts. &gt;&gt; He will literally change the entire meeting. &gt;&gt; Waiting on that predestinated seat. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, in my altar experience and in the experiences upcoming, I went to that altar and I said, "Lord, let me get something real from you. &gt;&gt; I need something more than churchity. &gt;&gt; I need more than just running through an an experience. I need you to live in my life. I'm going to be very honest with you tonight. I told him very vividly. &gt;&gt; I told him, "I cannot do this." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In my human ability. &gt;&gt; I don't know who I'm speaking to, but I'm speaking to you. I could not do this in my human ability. &gt;&gt; And neither can you. and he came. &gt;&gt; If we're not careful, we'll get an easy belieism. &gt;&gt; We'll try to make a we'll we'll try to make an easier way for our children. &gt;&gt; Just come and sit on a pew. &gt;&gt; Just be good Christians. &gt;&gt; Just marry a good wife. Just reflect Christ. If we're not careful, we'll get we'll start memorizing the message and memorizing quotes and memorizing scriptures and become good pew sitters. &gt;&gt; But let me remind you, the devil can do all of that. &gt;&gt; But there's one thing he cannot have, and that's a new birth. &gt;&gt; Peter stood there that day. &gt;&gt; Peter knew what we're talking about tonight. Simon Peter had believed the Christ and said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." And Jesus said, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you, but my father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; But yet Peter in just hours would literally &gt;&gt; rebuke the Lord &gt;&gt; for saying he was getting ready to be crucified. Jesus would tell him, "Simon, I prayed for you." &gt;&gt; When thou art converted, strengthened the brethren. &gt;&gt; So he was more than polished up. He was more than just religious. &gt;&gt; This was more than just emotion that he needed. His name had been changed, &gt;&gt; but the life hadn't arrived yet. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I don't want emotion." Well, anything without emotion's dead. &gt;&gt; Emotion just comes with it. &gt;&gt; Passion just comes with it. &gt;&gt; Life just comes with it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? We need more than a social gospel. &gt;&gt; This little woman needed more than a social gospel. &gt;&gt; She needed more than just a just an identity change from being a harlot to a churchgoer. &gt;&gt; The Pharisees, their churches hadn't changed their life. &gt;&gt; But there was something about this man. If I can only get to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; She ran home and she brother said she went up into her closet. &gt;&gt; Went back into the back of the closet and there was a shock there with all the money that she had. &gt;&gt; Listen, God's not looking for your fifth and sixth best. He wants everything that we've got. &gt;&gt; I'll serve him when it's convenient. God's not looking for a convenience. &gt;&gt; He wants our whole life. This woman begins to make her way towards a store. It's a store she's been at many times. &gt;&gt; And she's looking for more than an attractive scent. She wants the best. &gt;&gt; She wants the best that this man has. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She throws her money out on the counter and he begins to count it and ask ask why why she's wanting it. And she begins to tell him her purpose. Why are you wasting your money? Brother Bram said, he said, the man begins to argue with her. She says, listen, just give me the best that you've got. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what your critics say about you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't need to go to church that much. &gt;&gt; Why did you quit listening to that kind of a music? Why did you go quit low to that kind of entertainment? Why did you leave all your friends aside? Brother Ron, I'm afraid my I'm afraid. I'm afraid of my friends. I'm afraid to leave my friends. Don't you worry about your friends. Your friends will leave you. &gt;&gt; And you'll get some real friends. &gt;&gt; You'll get the kind of friends that'll be that'll be a kind of friend that will be with you through thick and thin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. On good days, bad days. She begins to make her way. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And listen, she has purpose in her mind. &gt;&gt; Maybe like some of you when you came to this meeting with great expectation. &gt;&gt; I don't know what this meeting will be like, but whatever it's like, I'm going to go to where he's at. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She knew that she wasn't welcome. &gt;&gt; She knew that she hadn't got an invitation. Right. &gt;&gt; But there was somebody that was sitting at the room that needed her attention. &gt;&gt; She made her way. No doubt she had to sneak her way &gt;&gt; past men that would have turned her around &gt;&gt; because no way would she been welcome at this place. &gt;&gt; She makes her way to where he's at. Yes, sir. And brother Brandham said she be to wash his feet with her tears. &gt;&gt; I want you to just think about this just for a few moments. Here's the Messiah. Here's the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Here's a woman predestinated &gt;&gt; of all of the men and women since Adam. Here is the woman that's predestinated to wash his feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of all of all of the incredible human beings &gt;&gt; that would come since Adam, &gt;&gt; here is the woman. Listen, because God in his mind knows who's going to be where, who's going to be born where in his pre-planning, &gt;&gt; he knows your nature. Listen, he knows everything that's about you. Listen, he predestinates this woman. &gt;&gt; He puts this burden on her heart. &gt;&gt; Let me just use a term. He bypasses a million, &gt;&gt; 10 million, a 100 million. to use her to wash the Messiah's feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; her sins has brought her to this spot. &gt;&gt; And here is the lamb of God that can take away the sins not only of her &gt;&gt; but of the whole world. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To her, this is more than an event. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Listen, she had no way of knowing will he accept me or reject me. &gt;&gt; But she was willing. &gt;&gt; She was willing. Whatever. &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy. No way was she worthy. &gt;&gt; She makes her way. &gt;&gt; She struggles to where he's at. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you've got to press your way to worship. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you've got to fight your way through every demon of hell. &gt;&gt; Every demon of Leo. &gt;&gt; You got to fight your way through every dark spirit. &gt;&gt; Even when you walk in church, you got to press your way to worship the Lord. You got to press your way past pride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, you've been a Christian for years. &gt;&gt; You struggle to pray. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you struggle to read your read your Bible, struggle to listen to tapes, &gt;&gt; and that same enemy meets you in a service after service, &gt;&gt; bombard your mind, bombard your worship, but your lips were made to praise the Lord. your voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not only is Brother Brandham's voice distinctive, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; he has a distinctive voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; But not only his voice was distinctive, your pastor's voice was distinctive. My voice is distinctive. Each and every one of you has a distinctive voice, &gt;&gt; but it was made in such a way. &gt;&gt; It was made in such a way until he could recognize our voice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every man was built to worship God. &gt;&gt; He was built to worship God. He was built to come into his presence. There was a thirst that was placed in him since a baby to worship God. &gt;&gt; And Satan tries to satisfy that thirst with the gods of the world, the gods of sports, the gods of humanity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when we come into his presence, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, we want to give him everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're built to be in a three room house. He said, &gt;&gt; "Anybody can be in the kitchen. Anybody can be in the living room. &gt;&gt; But he wants his wife to come to the bedroom to become intimate with him. We want a relationship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't want to say this is just the best that we got. Take it or leave it. &gt;&gt; We want to give him our all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can see Ruth when she makes her way. She's worked in the field. She's done all. Hallelujah. She's watched his movements. Now she's instructed by her mother-in-law. go lay at his feet. &gt;&gt; She knows the persecution's going to come. She knows they're going to say all matter of things about her, but she's pressed to predestinated to be the bride, &gt;&gt; a type of the bride of this day. And she's willing to lay at the kinsman's feet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you willing to lay at his feet? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a scene this is. You've heard it. You've heard these kinds of sermons over and over in your life, just as I did. But what if you had have been the person that was asked selected to be in his feet. She stays there. She brings him all her sorrow. all of her broken promises, all of her heartache, all of her complexes. She brings in all the strains of her own humanity. &gt;&gt; This is her opportunity. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Listen, opportunity doesn't happen every moment. &gt;&gt; The courier that brought the message missed his opportunity. Right. &gt;&gt; The rich young ruler, he missed his opportunity. &gt;&gt; Elvis Presley missed his opportunity. &gt;&gt; The celebrities of hell missed their opportunity. &gt;&gt; Listen, there's been many of people that sat with us in churches &gt;&gt; that missed their opportunity. &gt;&gt; Blind Barameus said, he was standing by a rock wall. Brother man said, "A cool day, &gt;&gt; sun beaming down on that that wall." He backed himself up against the wall and he was standing there like he stood many days. &gt;&gt; Maybe he could remember the turtle doves that he's offered up and he could remember other things &gt;&gt; and he hears a noise coming down the road &gt;&gt; and people are worshiping and screaming and hollering and he hears testimony, maybe another testimony. I had this disease. I couldn't walk. I couldn't see and he touched me and I'm well. &gt;&gt; And he can remember when he was a little boy sitting on his mama's lap and she's rehearsing to him about Elijah's God. &gt;&gt; Jehovah &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; She goes through the attributes of God. &gt;&gt; There's one coming. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he hears the testimonies coming by his way. And there's a noise. Re said wherever Jesus is always a lot of noise. &gt;&gt; This is his opportunity. &gt;&gt; We don't know how old he was, but now age is starting to pass him by. This is his opportunity. He didn't even know what to call him, &gt;&gt; but he be to scream, "Thou son of David, &gt;&gt; have mercy." &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. Whatever it takes to stop him in his tracks, &gt;&gt; listen. Do whatever it takes in this building this week. &gt;&gt; Do whatever it takes to get his attention. Brother Ron, why are you so passionate? I'll tell you why I'm passionate. This may be the last meeting. &gt;&gt; Noah preached the last service. &gt;&gt; Noah preached the last service. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't that Noah that's the one shut the door. God shut the door. Luther stepped into the pull pit and preached the last message. Are you with me? Wesley preached the last one. Brother Brown preached the last one. We don't know when it'll be our last one. &gt;&gt; Oh, but we've been coming to church for years, but it's soon coming to an end. &gt;&gt; This woman knew it was her opportunity to be at his feet. &gt;&gt; She had taken some wrong roads in life. She had walked down some wrong paths in life. She had made some wrong choices. Brother Ron, I've made some wrong choices. Nobody here is to beat you to with your choices. &gt;&gt; But listen, listen. Let God start changing the way you make your choices. Brother Brandham says she pours out the oint and it begins to fill the whole room. &gt;&gt; He has she has the whole the whole place's attention now. And now the man that's the head of the party, his name is Simon. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to this quotation. This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is. Let me just say this to you. The reason that he was even in the room was for her. &gt;&gt; He wasn't there for Simon. &gt;&gt; He wasn't there for those religious men. &gt;&gt; They God had used them to invite him. &gt;&gt; To get her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The whole reason of why he was there was for her. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a thought. &gt;&gt; What an incredible thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; All of this money, all of these celebrities, all of these Pharisees, all of the social light, all the meat that was cooked, all the wine that was drank, &gt;&gt; all of the setup, all of the work behind the scenes was to get her there. And they didn't even know Oh, I feel like jumping to the top of this tent right now. &gt;&gt; He would have came to this earth and did it all if it was just for me. If he knew, &gt;&gt; he more than just knew this predestinated moment was for her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen how brother Brennham uses this. She was determined to get to Jesus. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the outside world says. &gt;&gt; Let's get to Jesus. &gt;&gt; He is the main thing. &gt;&gt; Listen to how he uses it. In fact, he says, I believe for the first time since Jesus had been at the feast, he felt at home. Jesus feels more at home with a repentant harlot &gt;&gt; than he than he would &gt;&gt; in your big fine classy church. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere we need. &gt;&gt; We're not here for the who's who. &gt;&gt; We're not here to how how fine we can be, how eloquent speakers that we can be. She's repentant. &gt;&gt; The tears are rolling down her cheeks and on his feet. &gt;&gt; She's washing his feet with the tears. &gt;&gt; She's kissing his feet. &gt;&gt; Sure she did. She didn't care what anybody thought. &gt;&gt; She was in the presence of Jesus. &gt;&gt; What does she care about her actions? Her heart was pouring out. the fountains of repentance. What beautiful water for his feet. &gt;&gt; She was washing them. &gt;&gt; She was hysterical. &gt;&gt; The man said, "And I was too." &gt;&gt; I was too. When I got in his presence, I got hysterical. &gt;&gt; I didn't care what anybody else thought. I know they said I was a holy ruler, but I don't care. &gt;&gt; I was before Jesus. I didn't care if they exccommunicated me from the church. I was in the presence of Jesus. As she was washing his feet, oh, I'd love to be there. Wouldn't you? And they were standing. The Pharisees nudged the other one. Said, "Now, if he was a prophet, he'd know that woman who she was." And he said, "It goes to show you that he don't know what he's talking about." He said, "She's kissing his feet. Kissing his feet cuz she's repenting. tears flowing down all of her hair. She had done gone all the top off of her head. She's her curls are all fell down around her. She stops and takes this out box out and she did that and she didn't break and she breaks it again. She pours the whole thing over him. all that she's got with the tears and the oil washing his feet and kissing the grease all over her mouth, her hair falling down. She picks up the curls. She sets his feet up and begins to wipe them with the hairs of her head. &gt;&gt; Don't never let these stories become common. Oh God, &gt;&gt; can you stay with me just a few more moments? &gt;&gt; The celebrity was there. All the society of the city was there. She looked like she was out of her head. Maybe she was, but she was at the feet of Jesus. People may act crazy, but what difference does it make when you're at the feet of Jesus? &gt;&gt; What do I care what they think? &gt;&gt; She was at the feet of Jesus. She was kissing him. &gt;&gt; The old Pharisee. Oh my. He was ready to blow up. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus turns his eyes and looks &gt;&gt; and I can see those eyes as he turns his sacred head. &gt;&gt; And he know the thoughts of that Pharisee. Simon, I've got something to talk to you about. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, you see Pharisee, one of these days to come to you. I've got something to talk to you about. You invited me here. You never give me any water for my feet. You never anointed my head with when I came in. Neither did you kiss me. Welcome. &gt;&gt; But the poor sinner ever since I've been sitting here. She's done nothing but wash my feet with her tears. Wipe them with the hairs of her head. Kiss my feet ever since I've been here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a judgment day it'll be &gt;&gt; when he looks at preacher after preacher and says, "You didn't welcome me at your church. &gt;&gt; Singer after singer, &gt;&gt; you're talent and you didn't welcome me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Know it alls. He said, "Mine's so full of stuff and no place for Jesus." &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Oh, Pharisee. He says, "No." He looked over. Now the woman's scared. What's he going to say? &gt;&gt; Is he going to condemn her? &gt;&gt; Cuz his words is the words that matter. It doesn't matter what they say. &gt;&gt; I could care less what Obama says. &gt;&gt; I could care less what the dignitaries of the city says. &gt;&gt; It's what he says. &gt;&gt; It's what he says. &gt;&gt; He's the one that makes a difference. &gt;&gt; He's the important one in this building tonight. I'll tell you the important one here is tonight. It's him. &gt;&gt; Don't you never get your eyes on a man. You keep your eyes on him. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I'm not the one that you're feeding on. You're feeding on more than the mind of a man. You're feeding on the body word of the Son of Man. &gt;&gt; I want him to be a trapper. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is he going to condemn her? Let me just say, did he jerk his foot back and say, "Don't do that." No. &gt;&gt; Jesus don't do things like that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He never pulled his foot back. No, sir. He sat right there and watched her. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. She was doing for him what they ought to have done. &gt;&gt; She was doing for him what they ought to have done. &gt;&gt; There was the Pharisee, the bishop of the church with all the pastors and elders standing around thought themselves too good to touch this holy roller. Right. &gt;&gt; This poor little woman standing there now. &gt;&gt; She is going to receive. &gt;&gt; She knowed that she loved him. &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. The greatest thing you can ever do is fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; When you fall in love with him, &gt;&gt; Yes sir. There is nothing in this world matters &gt;&gt; when you fall in love with him. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; When you fall in love with him, listen, it just gets better. &gt;&gt; Every service, every day, every scripture, every tape, &gt;&gt; every prayer meeting, no matter how bad your trials are, no matter how dark your valleys are. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a love affair. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to make yourself go to church anymore. &gt;&gt; You don't have to make yourself pray anymore. Had she done something wrong? He said one day whosoever will let him come and they wouldn't and she wanted to. &gt;&gt; If these big starchy churches won't worship God, God will put out you poor people and he'll let you do it. He will call the sinners and the harlots from the streets to do it. &gt;&gt; Somebody is going to worship God. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; Then look at that little woman. She's startled. Her big brown eyes as beautiful as they was. Looked up. Then he turns after looking at the Pharisees. Grease all over her face and her tears washed down her face. Her hair hanging in streaks. There she was. What's he going to do? What's he going to do? &gt;&gt; Simon, I come at your invitation. You invited me. You never washed my feet. You g You never anointed my oil all on my hands and my neck. You never kissed me. Welcome. But this poor sinner has constantly kissed my feet. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who would love the most? He begins to say &gt;&gt; and he gives him a parable. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said in his embarrassment, he stood there redfaced knowing he was trapped. And now the woman that has been at the feet that they've made fun of, now she becomes their envy. Though her sins be many, &gt;&gt; though her sins be many, &gt;&gt; g &gt;&gt; she is forgiven. &gt;&gt; Only the lamb can do that. Only the lamb &gt;&gt; can do that. &gt;&gt; Many sacrifices and preached has been in order but only the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Very shout an unwelcome Christ. &gt;&gt; But the lamb of God &gt;&gt; pronounces out of his lips &gt;&gt; though your sins be many. You are forgiven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just a couple more minutes. &gt;&gt; Forgiven. Brother Brandham said, he said it's more than just being justified. He said justified is as though you never did it in the first place. It wasn't even the real you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, I was this and I was that and I wasn't. Come to a revelation. It wasn't you. That was your father's and mother's DNA poured down in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You was named a sinner. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But now you're an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, but you was you was no sir. When God justified me, &gt;&gt; he predestinated me. Romans chapter 8, he predestinated me before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And God, who is rich in mercy, &gt;&gt; never saw me as a drug addict, &gt;&gt; never saw me in my sin, never saw me in my father's iniquities, never saw me in any of my mistakes. But God who is rich in mercy took my deed that had a whole lot of accusation against it and he washed it with his blood. &gt;&gt; He became my kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; He became worthy &gt;&gt; and he bought he paid for the whole thing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's done. &gt;&gt; Things that you've been wrestling with for months, weeks, and years. &gt;&gt; If you could lay it at his feet tonight, &gt;&gt; and you could wash his feet with tears, &gt;&gt; you've already got your his attention &gt;&gt; just to get you here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, if I could only get his attention just to get you here. &gt;&gt; He knew you were coming. &gt;&gt; He waited on you to take your place. &gt;&gt; He knew what seat you would be in &gt;&gt; when they were lining up your seats. He knew where you would sit here tonight. &gt;&gt; And he would know that he would come to that seat. He would deal with your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He would come to where you're at. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To tell you, you don't have to live that way no more. &gt;&gt; This is more than sitting in a pew. It's more than just believing it. Cast all your cares on me. &gt;&gt; I care. I care for you. &gt;&gt; Every head bowed in this place just now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She found the fountain of purity. things that you've wrestled with in your mind, things that you've tried in your natural being to try to overcome. You know you like nobody else knows you and you'll go so high and then the enemy will knock you right back down cuz he knows your weaknesses. He'll allow you to enjoy service only to remind you of where you really living. Why don't you let the keys on the chains that are holding you? &gt;&gt; Why don't you let the Lord take those chains off your life? Let him take those dark shadows of your life, those dark complexes and depression of your life tonight. Won't you give it to him and say on the first night of this meeting, there's no need to wait till Sunday. On the first night of this meeting, &gt;&gt; I'd like to spend just a little bit of time with him. &gt;&gt; Would you be a hand up tonight? Say, "Brother Ron, I need him. I need him. I need him. I need him." Hallelujah. I need him. We're not here for show. We're not here for even one another right now. &gt;&gt; We're here for him. Hallelujah. You'll have to stand alone when you go home. &gt;&gt; You'll have to stand alone somewhere. Now, &gt;&gt; tonight, I want you to spend some time alone in the sanctuary of your heart. &gt;&gt; As the musicians would come, I want to invite you every hand. &gt;&gt; I want to invite you to come now to spend some time with him at this altar. I want to invite you to step out from where you're at just now. I want you to come. I don't know what your condition is, but he's created this meeting to speak to your heart. &gt;&gt; Young, old, &gt;&gt; you know who you are. You've been wanting a revival and he's the revival. &gt;&gt; You've allowed things to cool off. You've allowed things to get in your life. You've allowed some things to happen. &gt;&gt; Tonight's the opportunity to lay it at his feet for a little while. &gt;&gt; We're not here to question why or what. &gt;&gt; It's your turn. It's your turn just now, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; For such a time as this. Lord to need you. No matter how long she lived, she had a personal testimony. There was a day like no other day. And I'm sure she told that testimony a thousand times. Oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; there's none like you. None like you. I too had heard sermon after sermon after sermon after sermon after sermon and went to church for years. &gt;&gt; Raised in an incredible home. Boy, I finally met you. &gt;&gt; I didn't need psychology no more. &gt;&gt; I found the one that I really needed. All my wasted days, my failed opportunities. &gt;&gt; Lord, I couldn't rewrite yesterday or the day before. &gt;&gt; But I could determine, God, I'm going to put you first the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, there's people sitting here tonight, Father, &gt;&gt; that's even wrestling in this service. Satan's doing his best to get them through it and trying to keep them out of your presence. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you bring a victory in their lives. &gt;&gt; May you bring a victory tonight, Father. &gt;&gt; May you release the chains of sin and darkness. May every demon be bound tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. May the angels wings be felt sweeping through this building. Father, may your August presence just sweep down into our lives. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may the voice behind the voice, &gt;&gt; speak to the deep down in our heart, the thirst and the desire, Lord, the longing, &gt;&gt; that which lacking. Tonight I pray, &gt;&gt; Lord, may there come a peace in our life that passes all understanding, a peace we can't get from education, a peace we can't get from the world. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you would come and live in our lives. &gt;&gt; Lord, you hear our voices calling out to you just now. Come meet us at our altar. &gt;&gt; Come meet us at our pew just now. &gt;&gt; Come buy back every enemy. Come move in our lives, dear God. &gt;&gt; Lord, you see us just as we are. &gt;&gt; May we never be the same ever again. &gt;&gt; Oh God, maybe we've let things sit between us and God. We've become cool. We've allowed our prayer life to slip away. We've allowed the emotional Lord God of the world and things to steal our joy, rob us of our victory. &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask you to restore it tonight, dear Lord. &gt;&gt; Restore it tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, come to us just now, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just ask you move in our lives in Jesus Christ. Jesus name. Oh, dear God. Hallelujah. Won't you just call out to him just now? &gt;&gt; He's just waiting to hear your voice. &gt;&gt; Whether you're in the front of this tent or in the back of this tent, &gt;&gt; won't you just meet him where he's find him where he's at right now? &gt;&gt; He's waiting on you just now. &gt;&gt; He's sitting patiently waiting on you now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let him just do a work in your life. &gt;&gt; Let him just do a work in your life right now. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come Lord, &gt;&gt; brood over my soul. &gt;&gt; Oh God, come and brood over my soul. &gt;&gt; Sweep through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Change our disposition. Change our attitude. Change our starchiness. Oh God, &gt;&gt; minister to us just now. &gt;&gt; May the mighty angel just come just now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Worship him right now. &gt;&gt; Just make love to him just now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, &gt;&gt; you're welcome here. &gt;&gt; You're welcome here. &gt;&gt; We want to make you feel welcome. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thou art welcome in this place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. While on others thou art calling &gt;&gt; hear my humble cry. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come just now. Every year, &gt;&gt; everybody. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just enter in tonight? Why don't you just raise your hands to him? Do not This is your opportunity. This is your opportunity tonight. Why don't you just say, "Save your savior." Oh save your oh. Hallelujah. Hear my humble cry. Hallelujah. There's now Jesus not passing by. Oh, don't miss this opportunity, saints. Let's all stand. Oh saveior save my ground. Our love is our pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh savior bless your nameless &gt;&gt; speaking to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Dealing with hearts. Dealing with lives. &gt;&gt; Moved by the word. &gt;&gt; Lives being changed by the word. Lord, we want to lift up our cups to you tonight. &gt;&gt; We want to lift them high &gt;&gt; that we can say, "Fill my cup tonight, Lord. Fill my cup. &gt;&gt; I lift it up. &gt;&gt; Fill my cup, Lord. &gt;&gt; Heal my cup, Lord. Oh, I lift it up. Oh, this is my soul. Heaven. is my cup and how many want your cups filled tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh God, here's my cup. Come and Mercy my soul. Here's mine. I lift it up and make me. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful when Jesus comes near? &gt;&gt; Pharisees missed it. &gt;&gt; The party missed it. &gt;&gt; But there was one little lady She couldn't miss it &gt;&gt; because God had her in mind. &gt;&gt; Many might miss it tonight, &gt;&gt; but there's a little lady that's not going to miss it cuz God had you in mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about it, Brother West. God had us in mind. He prepared the whole feast. prepared the whole camp meeting &gt;&gt; so that he can meet with you. &gt;&gt; I want to thank him tonight. &gt;&gt; I want to praise him tonight. &gt;&gt; I want to worship him tonight for he is worthy &gt;&gt; that he was mindful of you young people that God sent a word. What an invitation was given. &gt;&gt; What an invitation was given. But people miss it. But I don't want to miss the moving of God. &gt;&gt; Forgiven. Forgiven. And people are selective. But he's not selective when he puts his eye upon you. &gt;&gt; We can say, "I'm forgiven." &gt;&gt; Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy. Thou art worthy. Oh, thou art worthy.

Amen. And young people, &gt;&gt; if you can come to a place in knowing that that was Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a pastor was opening up Messiah again. The veil is so thin. We think we see a man, but I see God. I see the word. So, was that brother Ron Spencer ministering to us or was that the word himself? You must determine in your heart that was the word that spoke to me. &gt;&gt; It wasn't some emotion that spoke. That was the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that word is what met my soul. And that's why I was moved not by a minister, but I've been moved by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Anchor that deep in your heart tonight. Continue in worship. Continue in praise. Continue in this atmosphere. Take it with you when you leave the tent. We want God to go to the cabins. We want the Holy Spirit. We want, as we had at winter camp, prayer meetings in our cabins speaking of what God's done individually within our lives. We want to thank all those that have come to visit and to be with us come many miles. We want to thank you. God's God &gt;&gt; and we don't want to limit the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we pray that God will go with you as you make your way off the grounds. We've opened the camp. It's a family camp. We have a full camp. And so with a full camp comes full responsibilities. And we hate to limit it, but once the service is over, if you wouldn't mind just making your way and make your way off the grounds. And if God should bring you back tomorrow night and bring your lick of fire, that's wonderful. Just mind the Holy Spirit. Mind God. And we thank you once again for being a part of what God is doing here at this camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God's not finished. This is just the beginning, young people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. Father, a song goes, I just want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. That means so much to me, Lord, when men and women are are dull of hearing today. But so, Lord, there's a receiving set within our soul and said, "That's the word. That's the word. Lord, there's something in us that wants to respond." Amen. Amen. Amen. Lord God, &gt;&gt; we're thankful that we heard the word tonight. And God, these young people had a receiver set. They just said, "Oh, God, you see my need. you see my burden and they've come and we pray God that you'll do greater things within their lives. &gt;&gt; We're thankful for the Holy Spirit and it's moving in their hearts tonight.
