[22:38] remember the husband of a coworker who's
[22:40] going in for open heart surgery. His
[22:42] name is Wayne.
[22:44] Just pray that the Lord would be with
[22:45] him and use this as an opportunity to
[22:49] speak to his heart. And remember our
[22:51] brother John speaking in Seattle. the
[22:53] Seattle meetings down there. If you have
[22:55] a need you want to take before the Lord,
[22:56] just let it be known with an uplifted
[22:58] hand. And brother Tom, would you
[22:59] actually come and take us before the
[23:01] Lord if you wouldn't mind?
[23:04] Amen. Thank you, brother Tom.
[23:07] Father, the worship has been sweet
[23:14] and we believe the presence of God is
[23:15] amongst your children this morning.
[23:19] So we want to open uh our hearts to you.
[23:24] Speak to us from your word this morning.
[23:27] Lord, as your servant will come, we all
[23:30] desire to walk in heavenly places.
[23:35] The believer's rightful position
[23:38] to sit with the king to dine as his
[23:41] guest.
[23:43] How a privileged these pilgrims are that
[23:47] we can eat off that body word of the son
[23:49] of man. Commune with the king and not
[23:53] only us speak to you but you speak back
[23:56] to us Lord. So may we have receptive
[24:00] hearts this morning as you will speak
[24:02] through your servant. Anoint him anoint
[24:05] us. And may this communion service
[24:09] around the word be sweet and pure and
[24:11] holy as the worship has been. We believe
[24:15] Lord even as the angels are in
[24:17] attendance that they must hold their
[24:20] voices as we will speak of the
[24:22] redemption of God and power of the blood
[24:25] and the bleach of your word and the
[24:28] cleansing power that lays within the
[24:31] token. We're so thankful, Lord, that we
[24:33] have an assembly of believers that can
[24:36] gather together lick of fire upon lick
[24:39] of fire. That Lord, that the Holy Ghost
[24:42] himself could dwell amongst the praise
[24:45] of your people. So let us lift up our
[24:48] voices together and worship the lamb for
[24:51] he is worthy of all glory and honor and
[24:53] praise. Lord, would you meet the needs
[24:56] of your children? Lord, with our hearts
[24:58] filled with faith that we would believe
[25:01] for our request this morning, not only
[25:03] do we ask, but we receive it in the name
[25:05] of Jesus.
[25:08] So, Father, as we now turn the order of
[25:10] the service to the word,
[25:13] may God, we come with open hearts to
[25:15] receive all the promises of God. We love
[25:19] your your servant, our pastor. We pray
[25:23] that you'll anoint the gifts and father
[25:26] god that you will anoint the need the
[25:29] needs and those that have joined with us
[25:31] on the internet on the phone lord may
[25:33] that same presence that is here would it
[25:36] go to them Lord God minister to every
[25:39] soul
[25:40] &gt;&gt; break up the stony heart Lord God and
[25:43] gives us heart of flesh that the word
[25:45] would be pinned
[25:47] &gt;&gt; upon them this morning we ask you now to
[25:50] meet every need in divine presence
[25:53] So we commit now this service to you in
[25:56] Jesus name.
[25:58] Amen.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[26:01] &gt;&gt; amen.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Love the Lord.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Have your seats
[26:05] please. I'm just going to take this time
[26:08] now to make a couple of announcements.
[26:12] And it's sort of always hard because
[26:15] just love to continue in this channel
[26:18] channel of worship for the word to come
[26:21] and speak to us. God bless you all.
[26:24] We have camp coming up.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; And we're going to our mission field.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Del Mount Baker Bible Way Camp.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; We're going to missionary to our
[26:36] children. Amen.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; And I want to thank right now every
[26:39] counselor and assistant counselor and
[26:41] those parents that will be on camp for
[26:43] giving your time, your money, and your
[26:46] effort to be there to be able to be a
[26:48] blessing to our children. You have
[26:50] sacrificed. And I believe our God will
[26:53] pour out abundantly upon you for all
[26:56] that you've done for the kingdom of God.
[26:58] And I I know you've heard it over the
[27:00] years. We always say one soul's worth
[27:02] it. But for me, with the family of God
[27:04] that is here and our children, to me,
[27:07] it's worth everything and all the effort
[27:09] that we do. And I want to say God bless
[27:11] you this morning and thank you for
[27:12] making yourselves available. We'll have
[27:14] a meeting this afternoon right after the
[27:16] service in the chapel, a meeting for
[27:19] counselors and assistance counselors who
[27:21] have been contacted.
[27:23] So, we have contacted those that will be
[27:25] taking uh a cabin and uh for junior and
[27:29] senior, we want everybody there that has
[27:31] been contacted. I wish to thank all
[27:34] those that have volunteered to want to
[27:37] be a counselor, an assistant counselor.
[27:39] And my joy is there's always more than
[27:42] than we need. And we try to to move
[27:45] different ones that have been or haven't
[27:47] been and the younger ones and bring them
[27:49] up. So, we've tried to do our best and I
[27:52] want to show my deep appreciation for
[27:55] your support and to thank you that you
[27:58] have um wanted to do something for the
[28:01] Lord and and and I'm so thankful we've
[28:03] got more. I'm not pulling teeth to get
[28:05] you there. So, God bless you for that.
[28:08] We have opened the camp to be a full
[28:10] family camp and we've got those that'll
[28:12] be staying on camp, which is wonderful.
[28:16] And um we have also contacted those that
[28:19] uh have wished to stay on camp and we've
[28:21] placed them. I want to thank Michael and
[28:23] Abigail and Sarah and my wife Joanne for
[28:26] doing this. This is a this is an
[28:27] unbelievable task because we had
[28:30] suggested to our counselors if the
[28:32] husband is counseling, we'd like to help
[28:34] out the sisters to be there with their
[28:36] children and vice versa to make this a
[28:38] full uh family camp. We do have a
[28:42] apparently um a waiting list still of
[28:44] people wanting to come on. So if you've
[28:47] been contacted and and and we've placed
[28:49] you into a place and then plans have
[28:52] changed and you're not going to be
[28:54] there, we don't want um to be surprised.
[28:56] So if you have changed your plans, would
[28:59] you please contact Sister Sarah at the
[29:01] office so we can have those that are on
[29:02] the waiting list come on in. And I I
[29:05] believe that there's still RV spots
[29:07] Sarah still available. So, if anybody uh
[29:10] desires a RV spot, I think there's um uh
[29:14] space there for you. We're looking
[29:16] forward to August. We're looking forward
[29:18] to a great time, junior camp and senior
[29:20] camp. And God bless you. Keep it in your
[29:22] prayers. And um Lord willing, I've
[29:26] talked to brother Ron Spencer. He's he's
[29:28] he's thrilled to be back with us again.
[29:30] And I'm I told him, I said, "Well, I
[29:32] think we're more thrilled than you are."
[29:34] I said, "We're going to work you and
[29:36] we're going to squeeze you." And I know
[29:39] what it is to be squeezed like a lemon.
[29:41] So, I told him, "We're going to squeeze
[29:42] you like a lemon." And um God bless you
[29:46] and remember the camp. Thank you.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Tom. Also want
[29:54] to remember the week at the witnessing
[29:55] booth, the week immediately following
[29:58] camp. Is there still a signup sheet out
[30:00] there? There's still a signup sheet. So,
[30:01] if you're interested and can donate even
[30:03] an evening or one shift, there's three
[30:05] different shifts per day if you just
[30:06] like to sign up and put your name on the
[30:08] list so that we have an idea of how many
[30:10] people are going to be able to make it
[30:11] out. Amen. We don't have any specials
[30:13] this morning. So, we're just going to
[30:14] sing a special all together. Why don't
[30:16] we sing here is love as we prepare for
[30:18] our brother Episcopal to come and bring
[30:20] the word. Amen. Are you hungry?
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're eager to hear the
[30:24] word. So, let's just take another moment
[30:25] and continue to worship him. Amen.

[35:36] saying we are standing on holy ground
[35:39] and I know that they're angels.
[35:43] Amen. Oh, and we are standing
[35:52] on holy

[37:21] [Music]
[37:25] Amen. Amen.
[37:29] Hallelujah.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; You feel like you're standing on a holy
[37:34] ground.
[37:36] It's holy ground because the people get
[37:38] to meet God.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; We haven't come here just to sing. We
[37:42] haven't come here just to preach or to
[37:45] listen to preaching. We've come to meet
[37:47] with God.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. To draw closer to him.
[37:52] I have here a note that we are welcoming
[37:56] our uh brother John and sister Lois
[38:00] Okall. I believe it is. They're friends
[38:02] of brother Persal and sister Adah. and
[38:05] they just uh immigrated here from the
[38:08] Philippines. I wonder if they could
[38:10] stand.
[38:20] Amen. We're always welcome. You're
[38:23] welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus
[38:25] Christ.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; We pray that you'll not only receive but
[38:28] also participate and and uh benefit
[38:32] others with your presence. Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[38:37] Uh we we are really happy to hear also
[38:41] what uh Sister Jenny Lelay is doing
[38:44] better. Uh we praise God for that. It
[38:48] was really she was in I would think
[38:52] quite a critical situation. The doctors
[38:54] initially didn't know. I think they gave
[38:57] about 50/50 chance not on life but a
[39:00] 50-50 chance of with their procedure
[39:02] being successful
[39:04] uh with these four aneurisms
[39:07] that were uh feeding blood to her uh her
[39:13] pancreas I believe no her pancreas began
[39:15] to swell after that and so we begin to
[39:18] have some difficulties to her spleen it
[39:21] was and uh so I think many of you
[39:24] received the email
[39:27] Uh, you know, we can go into all of the
[39:29] details,
[39:31] but the Bible is simple.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that health thee.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said, healing is in the
[39:40] body. And that's the thing we have to
[39:42] look at. You know, the medical team and
[39:44] the medical staff, we're all happy.
[39:46] We're happy for them. We're happy for
[39:47] what they know. and uh they can look at
[39:50] the meters at the at all of the scopes
[39:53] and the different things and tell us
[39:56] what they say. But like the old brother
[39:58] or not the old brother but was with
[40:00] brother Brandham I think his child was
[40:02] about 12 years old and dying and he said
[40:05] to the nurse well he said dear you know
[40:07] you're looking at the medical equipment
[40:10] he said but I'm looking at the promise
[40:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[40:14] &gt;&gt; we're so thankful today we can look at
[40:16] the promise and brother brother brother
[40:19] James and I know John and Marie and uh
[40:22] sister Jenny and all of the relatives of
[40:25] the Dodge family and all all the saints
[40:27] where Sister Sally sent word out. We
[40:30] were in prayer for her and really
[40:32] feeling for her and God has uh done
[40:35] something on her behalf. Brother Gilbert
[40:37] Oello's mom, I believe she's stabilizing
[40:41] some and and Sister Lois has been
[40:44] keeping us in in uh in informed. We have
[40:48] now those are those are physical things
[40:50] but we also have and I want the
[40:52] congregation to know on Friday night I
[40:54] was blessed to be able to be in the
[40:56] prayer service and it was wonderful. It
[40:59] just wonderful that people began to
[41:01] rejoice and began to worship
[41:04] uh after prayer and it was just hard to
[41:07] get away and I didn't leave here till
[41:09] about 10:30.
[41:11] uh if you want to really have a blessing
[41:14] uh not only for yourself but be a
[41:16] blessing because I want the congregation
[41:18] to know you were prayed for
[41:21] &gt;&gt; on Friday evening and different ones
[41:23] lifted you up in prayer and all who
[41:24] would come in the doors so we want even
[41:27] you that uh maybe come from some
[41:29] distances if you come from Burnaby or
[41:31] whatever more it's worth the trip
[41:34] &gt;&gt; it's worth the trip we're glad that
[41:36] you're here this morning but it's really
[41:38] worth the trip it's worth the trip on
[41:40] Wednesday evening ing. Uh I a couple
[41:43] Wednesdays ago, Brother Tom was speaking
[41:45] and I just personally just receive
[41:47] personal direction because I'm sitting
[41:50] back here. When I hear a man of God
[41:52] preach, regardless of who it is, I
[41:55] listen to it for a personal reason.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; I want to hear. I want to be fed. Don't
[42:02] we all?
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so
[42:07] we're here to uh do that. I also I want
[42:11] to ask the congregation
[42:14] in your in your private time when you're
[42:16] alone and you have a moment and I would
[42:19] like you to remember the the camp we
[42:22] call it the camp the family camp
[42:24] whatever more and truly it is a family
[42:25] camp we had that uh you know personally
[42:28] I had that burden and vision and
[42:31] revelation I think maybe 22 23 years ago
[42:34] and uh you know I saw the young people
[42:37] and I felt that they their needed to be
[42:40] some place in the in a year is busy
[42:42] during the school year and the children
[42:44] are at school and they're at various
[42:46] activities and going here and there and
[42:49] you know maybe some sports things or
[42:51] some music lessons and there's so much
[42:54] today to keep the families parted and I
[42:59] thought it would just be a very special
[43:02] thing to be able to have a a week at
[43:04] least where the families could be
[43:07] together and it has been marvelous over
[43:09] the years. You know, young people, they
[43:11] end up having a deacon as a as a
[43:14] counselor and they never, you know,
[43:17] never dreamed that, you know, that they
[43:19] would get that close. And now they have
[43:22] other people who they would normally
[43:23] wouldn't get to know and they get to
[43:25] know them in a personal way. And and
[43:28] then next time they come to church and
[43:30] shake hands, it's a different kind. It's
[43:32] a different kind of a uh relationship.
[43:35] and and and then the believers
[43:37] themselves, we get to go there and be
[43:40] with one another and without all the
[43:42] pressures of life and maybe having to be
[43:45] engaged the next morning. I think it is
[43:48] a a wonderful time and I I really felt
[43:51] to ask you if you join with me in prayer
[43:55] for these days at camp. We want a Holy
[44:00] Ghost lifech changing days and time
[44:04] there. And I think all of us can say
[44:07] amen to that. We just want to hear. I I
[44:10] was praying already for brother uh uh
[44:14] brotherh Spencer that God would begin to
[44:17] just illuminate his heart and speak
[44:21] words to him and have him see what what
[44:24] God would have him speak when he comes
[44:27] here. I believe that that is uh we're
[44:30] going to we're in for a wonderful time.
[44:32] I don't want to just get enthused or
[44:34] happy in the meetings. I want to be able
[44:36] to come away and said, "God spoke to
[44:39] me." A lifechanging
[44:42] time.
[44:43] Brother Gary Walker, who you know was
[44:45] here and blessed us, uh he and brother
[44:48] Tom are going to speak right after our
[44:51] con our camp family camp. they will be
[44:54] going to uh Serbia and having having the
[44:59] speaking the convention there. I just
[45:01] want to say something about uh uh the
[45:03] meetings in Serbia. Of course, brother
[45:06] uh brother Milco has been so involved
[45:09] with those people for many many years
[45:10] because it's his former home country in
[45:13] Slovenia, which is one of the provinces
[45:15] of the former Yugoslavia.
[45:18] And but the people that go there, you
[45:21] say, you know, you I don't want you to
[45:23] relate it like our services. Exactly.
[45:26] Because many of the people who gather
[45:28] there, they don't have a church. They're
[45:32] maybe scattered in very various parts of
[45:35] the nation or countries and they come
[45:39] together and this is a very special time
[45:42] for them. Remember these brothers if you
[45:45] would. And then there's things happening
[45:47] behind the scenes. I think when we get
[45:50] on the other side, we're going to say,
[45:52] "I just saw the tip of the iceberg.
[45:55] We didn't see everything that was
[45:57] happening." So from week to week, I like
[45:59] to keep you kind of up to date. You You
[46:01] don't mind, do you? And uh uh so uh
[46:07] brother Gary sent me an email, sent also
[46:11] I think brother Tom the same email and
[46:14] he just wanted to thank us. He was he
[46:17] said I want to thank you brother Biscll
[46:19] for allowing me to come and and my
[46:22] testimony. He said I am getting letters
[46:25] and phone calls and emails from all over
[46:29] the world. He he didn't dream that the
[46:32] effect of the internet was going to have
[46:34] that much effect on his testimony. And
[46:37] the believers in Romania who streamed
[46:40] and and and saw the service services I
[46:44] should say they they have friends or
[46:46] relatives I guess or acquaintances in
[46:49] the Pentecostal church. And the
[46:51] Pentecostal church in Romania is really
[46:53] quite strong. And this one church at
[46:56] least or this group was very anti he
[46:59] said they were anti-branomism
[47:02] and they gave them uh this streaming the
[47:06] DVDs I guess it was and God so touched
[47:10] their heart with brother Gary's uh uh
[47:13] message and testimony and his preaching
[47:16] because he didn't just give a testimony
[47:18] that they have invited him to come to
[47:21] their church and their group. So,
[47:23] Brother Gary after the Serbia meetings
[47:25] is going into Romania to preach to a
[47:27] Pentecostal group. And I just say, God
[47:30] bless him. God endure him with great
[47:33] wisdom and power that he might declare
[47:35] the truth of God's word.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; I also got an email this last week from
[47:41] a couple
[47:43] in uh in Ohio. They go to brother Jeff
[47:46] Jenkins church and uh they said we have
[47:51] been sponsoring through one of the
[47:53] sponsoring children sponsoring uh uh
[47:56] organizations. We've been sponsoring a
[47:59] girl in Lut which is a a a country
[48:03] within South Africa and we've been
[48:06] sponsoring her for 13 years and she is
[48:09] now 17 and I think their sponsorship
[48:13] will end when she's perhaps 18. I'm just
[48:16] uh assuming that and uh I think if
[48:20] you're I'm I'm also just assuming that
[48:22] if you are sponsoring a child and you
[48:25] write them through one of these
[48:26] organization, it isn't that you can kind
[48:28] of convert them or try to do anything of
[48:31] a religious nature so much. But anyway,
[48:34] they told her uh when I was two years
[48:37] ago at brother Jeff's church, she said,
[48:40] "You spoke of the message hub." And so
[48:43] she said, "I mentioned this to this uh
[48:46] girl that we're sponsoring and uh and I
[48:50] I wish I had the picture of her. She's
[48:51] just a beautiful lovely girl from Lutu."
[48:56] And uh uh she went onto the hub. She
[48:59] does not speak English, but she went
[49:01] onto the hub and there's one message in
[49:04] her language and her language is sutu.
[49:08] And uh and and and she got that message
[49:11] book. It was the eagle stir as the eagle
[49:14] stirth her nest. And she read that book
[49:18] and wrote her sponsors back and said she
[49:22] was so happy to hear that God sent a
[49:25] prophet. And she said, "I know that he
[49:28] will strengthen and help me to
[49:30] understand the Bible." And I just
[49:32] thought, you know what extent God goes
[49:35] to. He will find his own
[49:38] &gt;&gt; wherever they are.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; He might inspire somebody. They might
[49:41] think they're just sponsoring a child
[49:43] for 13 years, but God knows exactly how
[49:46] he's he puts the whole network together.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; And you don't even know. You may think
[49:52] you're just doing your work, doing your
[49:54] job at your wherever, shopping, whatever
[49:56] more, but you don't know who you're
[49:58] meeting, and you don't know even what
[50:01] you're saying, but you're contacting
[50:03] somebody. You You know why? You're a
[50:05] witness.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; We're all witnesses here.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; You're a witness.
[50:11] whether you feel like it or not, you are
[50:14] a witness.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I thought that that would just
[50:17] be uh something interesting for you.
[50:21] Praise the Lord. Uh let's just stand and
[50:25] and uh I hope you feel as good as I do.
[50:30] I'm sure you do. I hope you feel better
[50:32] than I do.
[50:35] Amen. Amen. It's always a nervous time
[50:38] just standing here behind a pull pit and
[50:40] been looking to the Lord a great deal
[50:43] for this service. Pray that God will
[50:46] give us understanding that the service
[50:48] this morning will probably be a first a
[50:52] first part. There's a a a you know, as a
[50:56] minister, you begin to labor in the word
[50:59] and and then uh the very heart of the
[51:03] subject sometimes just is uh so hard to
[51:07] define and and and do you know why? Cuz
[51:10] it's just too big. The subject just too
[51:13] big and starts getting deep and and uh I
[51:16] got into some areas here and I thought,
[51:19] am I really seeing what I'm saying? You
[51:22] know, I found that the prophet of God,
[51:24] he just may use the same statement two
[51:26] or three times down through the
[51:29] scripture. And then you'll find that
[51:31] that phrase is I found in the Old
[51:34] Testament and that's in the book of
[51:36] Daniel. And then when I went there and
[51:38] said, "Well, I just want to see what the
[51:39] Hebrew what does it mean?" That phrase,
[51:42] he just used it. And then the thing just
[51:44] begins to explode and I get lost. I just
[51:48] get lost. I say I'm going to have to set
[51:50] that aside or I won't even have a
[51:52] service for Sunday morning.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; We're thankful for his word.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Just before we read the scripture, I'm
[51:59] going to be reading out of Matthew the
[52:01] 6th chapter,
[52:03] the Lord's Prayer. Let's just pray
[52:05] together.
[52:07] Lord Jesus, what a lovely time.
[52:12] What a lovely group of people. And I
[52:14] think of all of those that are on the
[52:17] internet and those that will archive and
[52:20] hear the archives from different parts
[52:22] of the world. I ask your blessing upon
[52:26] the bride, your bride. You had each one
[52:30] of them in your mind as you hung there
[52:33] on the cross and purchased their
[52:35] redemption. And we can say with the
[52:37] songwriter, "Oh, what a savior."
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, what a savior. the lamb
[52:44] of God who gave himself for us and loved
[52:48] us. We thank you Lord Jesus for
[52:50] redemption for the full impact of it in
[52:54] our lives and I ask that you'll bless uh
[52:57] us that have gathered here today Lord
[53:00] lovely group of people. I just pray
[53:02] father your holy spirit and the presence
[53:06] of the holy angels uh that are nearby in
[53:10] in attendance standing at each side of
[53:13] us Lord that as your prophet said we
[53:16] feel their influence. May we not be so
[53:20] oh God uh taken up with this life or the
[53:23] children or the little things of this
[53:25] service but may we be conscious the
[53:28] unseen realm is right beside me the
[53:32] theophony body my word body oh God and
[53:37] when when the breath has left this body
[53:40] I will go to that one father God and
[53:43] from this realm to that eternal realm oh
[53:46] let the eternal realm press in nearby,
[53:49] oh God. Oh God, let us feed on the word
[53:52] of God. I pray in Jesus name, I ask that
[53:55] you'll give uh ability, Lord, and
[53:58] instruction to my own mouth and lips and
[54:02] hearing for the people more than the
[54:04] hearing of the ears, but the hearing of
[54:06] the heart and soul. We love you, Lord
[54:09] Jesus. We thank you. Amen. Amen.
[54:14] Thank you to the musicians
[54:21] for those of you that I trust you all
[54:24] have your Bibles, but in case you don't
[54:26] have your Bibles,
[54:28] I uh
[54:30] I want to put our Lord's Prayer up
[54:33] and uh
[54:38] so
[54:40] we can read together if you Our
[54:44] Father, which art in heaven,
[54:48] hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,
[54:53] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[54:56] heaven. Give us this day our daily
[54:59] bread, and forgive us our debts as we
[55:02] forgive our debtors, and lead us not
[55:06] into temptation, but deliver us from
[55:09] evil. For thine is the kingdom and the
[55:13] power and the glory forever. Amen. While
[55:17] you're still standing, I just want you
[55:19] to notice the two verses.
[55:22] Thy kingdom come
[55:25] and for thine is the kingdom. The
[55:29] kingdom being mentioned twice in these
[55:32] uh in these verses. May God bless his
[55:35] word to our hearts. You may have your
[55:37] seat.
[55:38] I would ask for your kind attention and
[55:43] may the Lord help uh help us to
[55:47] uh approach this theme. You can turn the
[55:50] lights back on if you would please.
[55:54] Uh I want to speak on uh
[55:58] contending with two kingdoms.
[56:03] Contending with two kingdoms.
[56:07] Now the term kingdom is not something
[56:10] that's commonly used amongst us. We we
[56:13] use uh the nations, the nation states,
[56:18] uh empires, there's monarchies, there's
[56:22] different descriptions to describe uh a
[56:25] a a nation as such. The Bible speaks a
[56:29] great deal about kingdom. A kingdom can
[56:32] be an empire or a monarchy, a a realm of
[56:36] sovereignty.
[56:38] Uh dominion, it can speak of dominion
[56:41] and power and rule
[56:44] and also control.
[56:47] We we often refer to England as the UK.
[56:50] Well, that is for the United Kingdom
[56:53] because they at one time had a much
[56:56] larger kingdom than they do today which
[56:59] included nations all over uh Africa and
[57:03] India and the world and parts of Asia.
[57:06] Uh today there are kingdoms which still
[57:08] remain. There's the kingdom of uh Saudi
[57:11] Arabia, Bahrain,
[57:14] uh Mali in and Ghana in Africa and there
[57:18] are different places which uh this would
[57:21] be more applicable.
[57:23] But uh here in uh our country be it
[57:27] United States or Canada
[57:30] uh or some other country that you might
[57:33] be from we are governed by the laws of
[57:37] that country. Uh that country will have
[57:41] their laws and those laws will be in the
[57:44] federal capital. Uh so this is the
[57:47] earthly kingdom. We all are in an
[57:51] earthly kingdom.
[57:53] uh or the kingdoms of this world as it's
[57:55] spoken of in the Bible. Uh but there is
[57:59] really only two kingdoms and the kingdom
[58:03] of God uh which we will emphasize as we
[58:07] go on is is within you. So
[58:11] the law of this kingdom is not in some
[58:14] federal capital. The law of this kingdom
[58:18] is in you.
[58:22] The Constitution of the United States
[58:26] is not in everybody, every American
[58:29] citizen's heart. The Constitution of
[58:32] Canada, I cannot say the Constitution of
[58:35] Canada is in me. I would want to be able
[58:38] to draw on it if I have a need. Uh you'd
[58:42] want to be able to draw on the
[58:43] Constitution of your country if you have
[58:46] a need. And uh uh we hear certain
[58:50] certain of the seven main parts of the
[58:53] US Constitution quoted from time to
[58:55] time, the right to bear arms and the
[58:58] right of speech and and freedom of
[59:00] worship and all of these things. But the
[59:03] the the the kingdom of God, I want to
[59:09] try to impress upon you that kingdom and
[59:12] speak uh speak from that perspective.
[59:16] And the scripture tells us
[59:19] that the kingdom of God is within you
[59:24] &gt;&gt; and the laws of that kingdom are within
[59:27] you.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; We cannot say that of our country
[59:32] states.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; This is very different. But because we
[59:36] live in this world, I want to try to uh
[59:40] uh separate you from this world. And
[59:45] especially I pray that God will while we
[59:48] are here in this service be able to take
[59:50] our minds and and let it be divorced
[59:54] from this world. Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:00:01] uh we won't have we won't turn the
[1:00:04] lights down for this. I The kingdom of
[1:00:07] this the kingdom
[1:00:09] brother Brandham said the kingdom is the
[1:00:12] word of God made spirit and life in our
[1:00:17] own life.
[1:00:19] The kingdom
[1:00:21] is the word of God
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; made spirit and life in your own life.
[1:00:28] So the constitution of the United States
[1:00:31] isn't in you. We can say well the word
[1:00:34] is in us but th this kingdom really
[1:00:38] takes it a lot further. The kingdom the
[1:00:42] kingdom what makes up the kingdom. We're
[1:00:45] not talking about something abstract
[1:00:47] now. We're talking about a living
[1:00:48] kingdom. We're talking about a real
[1:00:51] kingdom. And the kingdom is the word of
[1:00:55] God. Not just the word of God, but the
[1:00:58] word of God made spirit and life in our
[1:01:04] own life.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Now, do we in our respective countries,
[1:01:11] do we live up to the full benefits of
[1:01:14] that country? Probably not. and others
[1:01:18] don't understand what their country or
[1:01:21] their constitution uh stands for. And
[1:01:23] neither do we know all the benefits that
[1:01:27] are ours in the word of God. But we have
[1:01:31] a power and it's not some governing
[1:01:34] power. It is a holy spirit of God. the
[1:01:39] one who is the author of this word who
[1:01:42] has been sent and is committed to make
[1:01:45] this a living a living constitution
[1:01:48] within us.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; It's made uh to make it a a living word
[1:01:53] within us. So we have the law within us.
[1:01:56] We have the benefits within us. We have
[1:01:58] all of these things within us. And that
[1:02:01] is not just uh some uh uh some
[1:02:07] conversation. And I'm not saying this
[1:02:08] for conversation sake, not saying it for
[1:02:10] a sermon's sake. And I want you to
[1:02:13] listen, if you would please, to what the
[1:02:15] prophet said in the seventh seal. The
[1:02:17] kingdom of God is coming and it's
[1:02:21] becoming more from the negative to the
[1:02:25] positive as it has been. In other words,
[1:02:28] it has been getting nearer from the
[1:02:31] negative to the positive. This is the
[1:02:33] seventh seal. It's getting nearer from
[1:02:36] the negative to the positive. And now
[1:02:40] that oughten to choke people from
[1:02:43] justification to sanctification to the
[1:02:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then here.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; So the sanctification is one place, the
[1:02:53] justification is one place and the
[1:02:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost is one place
[1:02:57] and then here is another place.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that? That's what
[1:03:03] he's saying. We're not adding anything
[1:03:05] to it. And then it is here
[1:03:09] and we're just drawing closer to God all
[1:03:13] the time.
[1:03:17] Now
[1:03:20] more from the negative to the positive.
[1:03:24] Now contending as I have given the title
[1:03:28] contending with two kingdoms. I want to
[1:03:30] take that may sound a little strange but
[1:03:32] I want to take this what this does
[1:03:35] contending can be contending is a state
[1:03:39] of something in other words it's a claim
[1:03:42] that something is true
[1:03:45] we are contending that something is true
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; contending also is to compete it is to
[1:03:54] com to compete for something a prize or
[1:03:58] a trophy we are contending for the
[1:04:01] faith.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; We are contending for the prize of the
[1:04:05] high calling in Christ Jesus. We're
[1:04:08] competing.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; There may be others who make the claim.
[1:04:12] But we have a we have a special unique
[1:04:14] position, friends, as believers of a
[1:04:16] vindicated message. This is not some
[1:04:19] word that is in the Vatican and not some
[1:04:21] word in some headquarters. This is a
[1:04:24] word that came from heaven.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. and came to a vindicated prophet's
[1:04:29] mouth. So we have no reason to doubt it,
[1:04:32] no reason to question it. So we are
[1:04:35] competing in that sense. It's a struggle
[1:04:38] with something or somebody. In other
[1:04:40] words, we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:04:42] blood, but against principalities. So
[1:04:45] it's not only something for, but it's
[1:04:48] also something against. It's not only
[1:04:50] positive. We're not only running in this
[1:04:53] race. We're not only uh making a claim.
[1:04:56] We're claiming I'm a son and daughter of
[1:04:59] God. You claim you have an office. You
[1:05:01] have a position. You're a father. You're
[1:05:04] a husband. You're a mother. You're a
[1:05:06] wife. You're a a believer. You're a
[1:05:08] daughter of God. You're a son of God.
[1:05:11] Don't ever belittle that position.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; That's a high calling. Amen.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; This is We're talking about the creator
[1:05:21] of heavens and earth. We're talking
[1:05:23] about the giver of every good thing.
[1:05:25] We're talking about a God that spilled
[1:05:27] out the planets and spoke the stars and
[1:05:30] all of these things into existence. I
[1:05:32] don't know how, but I believe it because
[1:05:34] that's what the word of God says.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And we and he is our father.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Our father
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; which art in heaven. My father
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; thy kingdom come.
[1:05:48] Thy kingdom come.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; I'm in another one. I'm contending down
[1:05:54] here, but I'm declaring your kingdom is
[1:05:57] the true kingdom. I'm contending that
[1:06:00] I've heard the word of that kingdom. I'm
[1:06:03] contending that the constitution of of
[1:06:06] that kingdom actually dwells in me. I'm
[1:06:09] contending that the Holy Spirit of God
[1:06:12] has been sent to me and is with me now
[1:06:15] and in you as an individual to make that
[1:06:18] to make that constitution or make that
[1:06:20] law a part of my life.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; That's very different
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; than just being an American, a Canadian
[1:06:29] or whatever else. Yes,
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[1:06:33] but against principalities, against
[1:06:35] powers, against the rulers of darkness
[1:06:38] in this world.
[1:06:41] To contend is to dispute with somebody.
[1:06:46] And he went, speaking of Apostle Paul,
[1:06:49] into the synagogue and spake boldly for
[1:06:52] the space of three months, disputing and
[1:06:55] persuading the things concerning the
[1:06:58] kingdom of God. This is contending.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; And we are contending.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; We're contending for one kingdom and
[1:07:07] we're contending against the other
[1:07:09] kingdom.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; And you are contending every day.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a great great struggle and a
[1:07:17] great uh revelation actually.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; There are only two powers.
[1:07:23] Brother Brandham has said there's only
[1:07:25] two powers.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Whatever country you come, whatever
[1:07:29] jurisdiction you're under, there's only
[1:07:31] two powers and there's really only two
[1:07:34] kingdoms.
[1:07:37] And the two powers
[1:07:41] really only two powers.
[1:07:46] There are only really two powers in all
[1:07:48] the universe of all of our differences
[1:07:51] between nations and differences between
[1:07:54] each other and everything. It all
[1:07:57] amounts up to two powers. There's only
[1:08:00] two powers and there's only two
[1:08:02] kingdoms. Two powers and two kingdoms.
[1:08:06] All the rest of the little minor things
[1:08:08] are connected with either one of these
[1:08:11] two powers, those powers. And those
[1:08:14] powers is God's power and Satan's power.
[1:08:19] And that is the power of life and the
[1:08:22] power of death. Now, that's the only two
[1:08:26] powers. I want to say today in all
[1:08:29] semimnity and seriousness,
[1:08:33] every person here is in one of those two
[1:08:37] kingdoms.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; You are not hanging somewhere in
[1:08:41] between.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; You're in the kingdom of God and under
[1:08:46] the power of eternal life
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; or you're in the kingdom of Satan
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; and under the reign of death. And it
[1:08:54] would be foolhardy. It would be the most
[1:08:56] foolish thing to sit and listen to the
[1:08:59] gospel of Jesus Christ and remain in
[1:09:02] that kingdom of darkness and kingdom of
[1:09:05] confusion and kingdom of defeat. I want
[1:09:08] you if you even if you even have the
[1:09:10] least sense that you might be there say
[1:09:13] I take a claim. I claim by the word of
[1:09:16] God my position in the kingdom of Jesus
[1:09:20] Christ. I take my place in the kingdom
[1:09:23] of God. Those are only two kingdoms. I'm
[1:09:27] contending for one.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And you may have to contend for it this
[1:09:31] morning.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Right. While you're here, how do I
[1:09:34] contend, brother Bisc? Make a
[1:09:36] confession.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; You can make the confession while I'm
[1:09:39] preaching. I'm a son of God. And if you
[1:09:42] haven't made a repentance, you can
[1:09:44] repent while I'm preaching. This this
[1:09:47] ministry, this preaching, this message
[1:09:50] is speaking to me. and I'm not sure
[1:09:52] where I'm born again. Father, in the
[1:09:56] name of Jesus Christ, your son, I repent
[1:09:59] of my wrongdoing. I repent of my uh sin.
[1:10:04] I repent of iniquity, which is to know
[1:10:06] to do good and not do it. I repent of it
[1:10:09] and I accept your gift of salvation
[1:10:12] through Jesus Christ. And you'll be born
[1:10:14] into the kingdom of God. And that's the
[1:10:17] only way to get into it.
[1:10:23] Hallelujah.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; I understand there's a ship off the
[1:10:26] coast of British Columbia with a couple
[1:10:27] hundred people coming from Sri Lanka
[1:10:31] wanting to get into this country and uh
[1:10:35] and on international law they might get
[1:10:38] accepted. Australia has refused them and
[1:10:41] there's debate in our country whether we
[1:10:44] should accept them or not. Canada seems
[1:10:47] to be very tolerant and sometimes maybe
[1:10:50] too tolerant but uh anyway there'll be a
[1:10:54] process and the last boys that landed
[1:10:56] here about 76 of them and I think
[1:10:58] there's about 200 this time if they were
[1:11:01] going to turn them aside they have to
[1:11:02] turn them aside while they're
[1:11:04] international waters if they get into
[1:11:06] Canadian waters according to the
[1:11:08] international law you can't turn the
[1:11:09] ship away you've got to receive the
[1:11:12] refugees if they are refugees we don't
[1:11:15] No, but there'll be a process and you go
[1:11:18] through this process. Well, I tell you
[1:11:20] there is a process and the process you
[1:11:23] must repent. You must turn around. There
[1:11:27] is no other way. And the process is you
[1:11:29] must be baptized. If you haven't been
[1:11:32] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:11:35] you can't come into this kingdom.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Some say, "I don't think it matters how
[1:11:41] you're baptized." It matters. The
[1:11:44] constitution has been written.
[1:11:46] Hallelujah. It makes a difference. You
[1:11:48] must be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:11:50] Christ to get into this kingdom.
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; And then the life of the author, the
[1:12:02] very life of Jesus Christ. Yes, sir.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; We will be filled and baptized with the
[1:12:07] Holy Ghost. It's our job to preach the
[1:12:10] gospel. Your job to repent. Our job and
[1:12:14] your job together to baptize you. And
[1:12:17] it's God's job to fill you with the Holy
[1:12:19] Ghost.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's your job to yield
[1:12:24] to the Holy Spirit. It's your job to
[1:12:26] call on the name of the Lord. Brother,
[1:12:29] sister, this thing works.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; If this thing didn't work, I wouldn't be
[1:12:34] here. This thing works. Can you say
[1:12:37] amen?
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I thank God for the
[1:12:42] kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven
[1:12:44] and the constitution, the word of God
[1:12:47] which is alive by the Holy Spirit. The
[1:12:50] kingdom is the word made alive in us by
[1:12:54] the spirit of God.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:08] One kingdom is the kingdom of
[1:13:10] righteousness with a divine structure.
[1:13:15] The kingdom is in you as apostle Paul
[1:13:18] has said
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; this is very unique. You are unique. The
[1:13:23] kingdom is in you and you are in the
[1:13:24] kingdom
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; both.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:30] In Christ is the mystery of God
[1:13:31] revealed. A beautiful quote, something
[1:13:33] you have to really ponder.
[1:13:36] The kingdom of God is within you, said
[1:13:38] the Bible, Jesus.
[1:13:41] We are not a denomination.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; And that's not just making a statement.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; A denomination has a doctrine.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; All denominations have doctrines. When
[1:13:53] you see a church, you just remember that
[1:13:55] is just a building. When you say this
[1:13:58] church is just a building,
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; the people who sit there listen to a
[1:14:02] word. They listen to a message. And what
[1:14:05] God is concerned about is not only where
[1:14:08] did the message that they're listening
[1:14:10] to come from, but how it was delivered
[1:14:13] to them.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; All kinds of people and churches will
[1:14:16] have this Bible laying on the pullpit,
[1:14:20] laying at the podium. But the channel
[1:14:23] through which it came, I tell you, I've
[1:14:25] got books, volumes, thick volumes like
[1:14:28] this. And they're they're filled with so
[1:14:31] many words, thousands and thousands of
[1:14:34] pages of scholars this and scholars that
[1:14:37] and liberal scholars and Orthodox
[1:14:40] scholars and the and the Hebrew view and
[1:14:43] the Jew the view of the Jews and and the
[1:14:47] early Phoenicians and all of these
[1:14:49] things. And when I'm reading some of
[1:14:51] those things that to see what do they
[1:14:53] got to say about the kingdom, what do
[1:14:55] they have to say about the resurrection,
[1:14:57] I don't have to read very far before I'm
[1:15:00] saying in my heart. I thank God for a
[1:15:04] prophet voice that made it so simple and
[1:15:07] made it so clear. Nobody has to make
[1:15:10] even a fool doesn't need to air therein.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:18] I'm glad I'm not in one of the kingdoms
[1:15:20] they describe.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; It doesn't work. There's no power in it.
[1:15:26] There's no absolute.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad we have a thus sayaith the
[1:15:32] Lord.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; We belong to a kingdom. And the kingdom
[1:15:42] is the word of God made spirit and life
[1:15:44] in our own life.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Bringing to pass every promise.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Let's say that together. Bringing to
[1:15:51] pass every promise. Say it again.
[1:15:55] Bringing to pass every promise. Lift
[1:15:58] your hand and say, "It's me. I believe
[1:16:00] that."
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Bringing to pass every promise. If you
[1:16:05] don't need it this morning, you'll need
[1:16:07] it one day. Hallelujah. That's the
[1:16:09] kingdom of God,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; bringing to pass every promise.
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; You want to be resurrected.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Who wants to have a resurrection
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of God?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; There's only one place to find it.
[1:16:27] That's in the word of God.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; That you must receive.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; You receive that word and the Holy
[1:16:33] Spirit will come and make that spirit in
[1:16:36] life in your own life.
[1:16:38] It's not good enough to say, "Well, it's
[1:16:39] wonderful. The preacher's enthused. It's
[1:16:42] in his life." That doesn't do you any
[1:16:44] good. You have to say, "In my own life."
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Every promise.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; It says we will meet him in the air. It
[1:16:52] says we will rise. I want that promise.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; I claim that promise.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:04] Yes.
[1:17:07] Lord.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And the word of God is one in his church
[1:17:13] today,
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; making it the headship of the body
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; that is redeemed to bring the message in
[1:17:20] the last day and to be taken up from the
[1:17:23] dead in the resurrection to go back to
[1:17:27] restore again as Adam and Eve in the
[1:17:30] beginning of the Garden of Eden. The
[1:17:33] three-fold mystery of God, his body. Oh,
[1:17:37] friends, I don't know how to tell you.
[1:17:40] I'm not reading this for you. I'm
[1:17:42] reading this for me. This is my promise.
[1:17:45] This is part of my constitution. This is
[1:17:48] part of the kingdom. The kingdom that is
[1:17:51] within me is declaring to me. I'm
[1:17:54] hearing words from my kingdom.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is making that
[1:17:59] spirit of life within me.
[1:18:02] Hallelujah. Even the word is the word of
[1:18:04] the kingdom.
[1:18:06] [Music]
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; This isn't a message, friends. This
[1:18:10] isn't just a sermon.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; This is life to you.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; This is what God is saying to you.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; This is a kingdom. You are in the
[1:18:19] kingdom.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; You're a you're a participant. You're a
[1:18:22] citizen of the kingdom.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; They have my social security number.
[1:18:27] Your social insurance number. And they
[1:18:29] have all kinds of data in detail. They
[1:18:32] know all about you and they know about
[1:18:34] how many offenses you've had and how
[1:18:36] many times you've been speeding down the
[1:18:38] highway and how many times you got
[1:18:40] misdemeanors and they know a whole bunch
[1:18:43] about you and it's all back in the
[1:18:45] headquarters. Well, I tell you what,
[1:18:47] there's a headquarters. My headquarters
[1:18:49] knows what it wants to keep and knows
[1:18:51] what it wants to forget.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; That's the headquarters I want. They
[1:18:59] know more. They don't have to have
[1:19:00] numbers. They know my own nature. They
[1:19:03] know my character. They know where I
[1:19:05] came from.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They know the seed gene that
[1:19:09] brought me down to this place.
[1:19:11] Hallelujah.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Spirit was hovering
[1:19:15] over every child of God when they issued
[1:19:17] out of their mother's womb and has
[1:19:19] watched over your footsteps all down
[1:19:22] through this life because you're a
[1:19:24] resident. You're a citizen of another
[1:19:26] kingdom.
[1:19:29] God's saying,
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; "You're my child,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; and he's not ashamed of it."
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; He isn't interested in your past. He's
[1:19:36] interested in your future.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; The other is a perverted kingdom.
[1:19:58] is the one we're contending against.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; We're contending against it.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; It's very real.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; It permeates every area of your life.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it is that you go
[1:20:11] to school. It's permeated your school
[1:20:13] rooms.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; I don't care where you shop. It's
[1:20:16] permeated the stores. It's permeated
[1:20:19] every area. It's permeated the news
[1:20:22] stand. It's permeated the service
[1:20:24] station. It's permeated, this kingdom
[1:20:27] has permeated science and education.
[1:20:30] It's permeated the economy. It's
[1:20:33] permeated everything. And we're
[1:20:35] contending against that kingdom.
[1:20:39] [Applause]
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot create.
[1:20:53] Satan can only pervert what has create
[1:20:57] what God has created.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And all sin
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; is righteousness perverted.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; And Satan perverts what God has made.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; And he made you to be a son or daughter.
[1:21:13] Listen to this. He made you to be a son
[1:21:15] or a daughter to him. And Satan
[1:21:18] perverted you. Changed your way of
[1:21:21] thinking. Change your mind, change your
[1:21:25] appetite, change your desire. That's how
[1:21:28] he works.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; He'll he he will in his perverted
[1:21:32] there's his system. He he changes your
[1:21:34] way of thinking.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; He changes your mind.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; See, he'll even have you start to think
[1:21:41] a different direction
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; and you start entertaining thoughts and
[1:21:45] pretty soon he's changed your mind.
[1:21:47] Right.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; And then he changed your mind and
[1:21:52] changed your appetite.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Then you find that the whole appetite
[1:21:56] you want to keep hearing things like
[1:21:58] that
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; or hearing something. That's why gossip
[1:22:01] is treacherous.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Gossip is absolutely treacherous.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; I want to declare in the name of the
[1:22:08] Lord, gossip is of the devil.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; What is yay is yay and nay is nay. And
[1:22:16] what is more of that? Jesus said is
[1:22:18] evil.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; You brothers and sisters, I'm saying to
[1:22:25] you, you watch what you hear
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; and watch what you say
[1:22:30] [Applause]
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; because Satan, the other kingdom of
[1:22:35] Satan is is is there to change your
[1:22:38] mind.
[1:22:41] You'll find I I find it str you have to
[1:22:44] struggle against that all the time. And
[1:22:46] then you start thinking, well, you
[1:22:49] desire, you know,
[1:22:51] your desire maybe isn't as fervent as it
[1:22:53] used to be and I don't know if I want to
[1:22:55] go to church or I I don't know if I want
[1:22:58] to be around those people or I maybe
[1:22:59] just kind of isolate myself or I don't
[1:23:02] know what kind of thought it is. He's
[1:23:04] got a whole multitude of thoughts.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; This is his kingdom. Right?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; And you start thinking something about,
[1:23:11] and brother Brennham deals with, you
[1:23:13] start thinking something about a certain
[1:23:15] person.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; And uh and you'll find out if you're not
[1:23:19] careful, it's Satan trying to change
[1:23:22] your thinking.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; One time you thought they're fine.
[1:23:25] You're they're a brother, they're a
[1:23:27] sister, and he wants to change your
[1:23:29] thinking.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And then he'll change your mind.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; That person not my friend. That person's
[1:23:36] my enemy.
[1:23:38] You know, if you start thinking that and
[1:23:41] then it says uh you change your mind or
[1:23:43] change your appetite and change your
[1:23:46] desire.
[1:23:50] All right, you can take that off,
[1:23:51] please. Now,
[1:23:53] now
[1:23:58] Satan's Eden.
[1:24:00] In Satan's Eden of sin and unbelief,
[1:24:03] the prophet said, "In Satan's Eden, a
[1:24:06] religious perversion,
[1:24:08] a perverted, perverted kingdom, a
[1:24:11] religious perversion,
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; perverted." Satan loves religion.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; And he loves to turn the message into a
[1:24:20] mere religion.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham speaks of it clearly.
[1:24:24] It just becoming a tradition. We don't
[1:24:27] want the Lord's table to become a
[1:24:30] tradition or footwashing to become a
[1:24:33] tradition or to say that we believe in
[1:24:35] Malachi 4. That's not enough.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; We want to have and be able to say my
[1:24:42] heart has been turned back to the faith
[1:24:45] of the fathers.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, we should expect the
[1:24:51] same thing, the same thing that the
[1:24:53] fathers had. You can have it as well.
[1:24:56] You're a citizen of this kingdom.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; I'm saying that.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching. I'm declaring that.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Every bloodwashed son and daughter of
[1:25:08] God. And if you're not, don't leave this
[1:25:11] room. Don't leave this place until you
[1:25:14] know in your heart what Brother Eisll's
[1:25:17] preaching is true within your own soul
[1:25:19] and life.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; I'm bloodbought.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've been purchased. God has
[1:25:26] declared it and I confess his
[1:25:29] declaration.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Speaking of Satan's Eden, he said, "This
[1:25:36] kingdom," listen to this declaration by
[1:25:40] the prophet, "This kingdom has to die."
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Listen to his second statement. This
[1:25:47] kingdom shall die.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:25:52] Oh. Do
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; you know what, friends? In heaven, and
[1:25:56] it speaks of those that saw the uh uh uh
[1:26:00] uh saw the Satan, the old serpent, the
[1:26:03] devil, cast into the lake of fire. And
[1:26:07] the people didn't weep. They didn't
[1:26:09] sympathize. They didn't say, "That's too
[1:26:11] bad." They rejoiced.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; They said, "Hallelujah."
[1:26:15] And when you have this kind of
[1:26:17] vindicated prophet told people who their
[1:26:20] name is, told them where that pillar of
[1:26:22] fire was, told them their address, told
[1:26:25] them their disease, and when he says to
[1:26:27] you, "This kingdom shall die, this
[1:26:31] church ought to rejoice."
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Not at my preaching at those words.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; There should be something in your soul
[1:26:39] says, "I can't wait till this kingdom
[1:26:42] dies.
[1:26:45] I want to see this wickedness destroyed.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; I just feel like quitting preaching
[1:26:58] right now. Go home and rejoice the rest
[1:27:01] of the day. This kingdom is going down.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; This kingdom is being destroyed.
[1:27:10] And when you hear the things in the
[1:27:12] news, it shouldn't surprise you.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; The prophet said some he he may made
[1:27:17] some great declarations about this
[1:27:19] generation, about Leodysia, about
[1:27:22] America, and about the world as a whole.
[1:27:26] It's going down.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; The economy is shaking.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; It has been a meltdown of banks, banking
[1:27:33] system. And as of today, it's not banks
[1:27:36] that are going down. its nations are
[1:27:38] going down. Iceland went bankrupt.
[1:27:40] Ireland went bankrupt right now. They
[1:27:43] just bailed out uh Greece
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; right
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; with Merkel who is the premier prime
[1:27:49] president of Germany. I think gave about
[1:27:52] 58 billion euros to to and get the
[1:27:57] community of nations to bail out Greece.
[1:28:00] And they had the they had dissension
[1:28:02] amongst the Euro nations, the Euro
[1:28:04] kingdoms because uh I understood that
[1:28:07] Italy and Spain are hanging on with
[1:28:09] their fingernails.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; So we can't contribute. We're barely
[1:28:13] hanging on ourselves. So now it's not a
[1:28:16] meltdown. Say, "Well, the bank, you
[1:28:17] know, I can't get money from the bank."
[1:28:19] Don't worry. Whole nations can't get
[1:28:21] money. They're they're they're failing.
[1:28:23] Whole nations.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if you understand, I've
[1:28:30] even just read recently where there's
[1:28:32] been economists that says the second
[1:28:34] wave hasn't hit yet.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And they didn't just say it as a
[1:28:37] statement. They said the first the first
[1:28:40] meltdown in America, North America here,
[1:28:42] was the was the meltdown of of of the
[1:28:45] retail market of homes. But they said
[1:28:48] the big one is the commercial,
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; high office buildings and warehouses and
[1:28:54] factories because those buildings have
[1:28:57] long-term have long-term uh mortgages on
[1:29:01] them. But the long-term mortgage on your
[1:29:03] home can be 30 years, but a long-term
[1:29:05] mortgage on an industrial an industrial
[1:29:08] or commercial complex is only 10 years.
[1:29:11] That's a long term. And so some of these
[1:29:13] mortgages were all in place when the
[1:29:15] meltdown came. They maybe only have two
[1:29:17] or three years yet to go and the banks
[1:29:21] have already stated they will not
[1:29:23] refinance them.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And they said that will be the big one.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; We get quiet.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; We should say praise God.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; This kingdom has to go down.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; This kingdom has to then what do we do?
[1:29:41] Well,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; grow a garden.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Have a chicken. Right.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Have a pig or a cow or something in your
[1:29:49] backyard.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Are you serious? I've been in places
[1:29:55] where they had to have that.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; I was here. I was in Serbia when they
[1:30:01] didn't have any money. There was a whole
[1:30:03] shoe box, a whole shoe box of money. And
[1:30:06] there was billions and billions and
[1:30:08] billions of currency money in that. And
[1:30:12] you know what was happening to it? The
[1:30:13] kids were playing with it.
[1:30:15] I said, 'Hey, can I have some of that?
[1:30:18] Sure. So, I just took $30 billion out
[1:30:20] and stuck it in my pocket. I think I'll
[1:30:22] go back and buy all of Vancouver.
[1:30:25] That $30 billion wouldn't buy a loaf of
[1:30:27] bread.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? That's That's like
[1:30:31] a story joke. That's reality.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; That money was printed
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; on good paper and they said when they
[1:30:38] were done printing it, it wasn't worth
[1:30:40] the paper it was written on.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:30:46] I'm going up
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; in the first resurrection.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; My constitution says that
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; the law of my country, my citizenship is
[1:30:57] in heaven. Your citizenship
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; is in heaven.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Now the prayer that Jesus taught
[1:31:18] actually has all the elements of the cit
[1:31:21] of the nation of the kingdom in it.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Our father
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; which art in Washington. No.
[1:31:36] Which is in London. No.
[1:31:39] And thank God it's not in Ottawa.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Our father,
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; the one I came out of.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Which art in heaven
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; beyond this world.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our Father which art in
[1:32:06] heaven,
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; hallowed, holy
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; is your name.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; We can't say that about any of our
[1:32:12] federal systems. We can't say holy is
[1:32:15] your name.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; In fact is if you're brave enough, you'd
[1:32:18] say it's it's not truth that comes out
[1:32:20] of there. It's wickedness often that
[1:32:23] comes out of there. It's all kinds of
[1:32:25] lobbying and all kinds of of of
[1:32:28] conniving and all kinds of thing taking
[1:32:31] place. But we have a holy kingdom. Our
[1:32:34] father which art in heaven. Hallow and
[1:32:37] holy. Holy and righteous is thy name.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; First thing, thy kingdom come.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Thy government rule.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want that kingdom come.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; We want that government.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want it to come into
[1:32:58] play. And we want it. We even want that
[1:33:01] government to rule more in our lives
[1:33:03] now.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Teach me your laws.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Teach me your ways.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; and thy will be done
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; on earth
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; on earth. We're not waiting for some
[1:33:19] time in the sky. Thy will be done on
[1:33:22] earth.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Now establish, oh God, thy kingdom.
[1:33:27] And I can tell you, you cannot find out
[1:33:29] what this kingdom is about outside of
[1:33:31] the message of the hour.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Give us
[1:33:51] this day our daily bread. That's the
[1:33:55] economy. Forgive
[1:34:02] us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
[1:34:05] That's the justice system.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; And lead us not into temptation,
[1:34:16] the things that are desirable and
[1:34:18] entertaining to us.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Don't lead us into temptation, but
[1:34:23] deliver us from evil. Loose us from
[1:34:25] every band. Loose us from everything
[1:34:28] that would try to bind us down.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:34:36] Why?
[1:34:38] Why do we want this economy? Why do we
[1:34:41] want this justice system? Why do we want
[1:34:44] not to be led into it? We want to walk
[1:34:46] in a way of truth and life. Why do we
[1:34:49] want that? For thine is the kingdom.
[1:34:53] That's what this kingdom is all about.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; And the power
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; to bring it to pass. And the glory.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; How long? Till the next election.
[1:35:02] Forever.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; And ever. Amen. Amen. Forever and ever.
[1:35:10] Amen. Amen. So be it. Forever. Forever.
[1:35:16] And it'll never change. There's not
[1:35:19] going to be a new set of promises at the
[1:35:21] next election. There is no election.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; This is a theocracy, not a democracy. A
[1:35:28] theocracy
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; by a righteous king.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; And we're right at that stage in the
[1:35:33] message
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; where he'll become king of kings.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; And Lord of lords,
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:35:51] prophecy.
[1:35:53] Prophecy of Jesus coming.
[1:35:56] There's a prophecy in Isaiah. You know
[1:36:00] it well. Now, just captivate every
[1:36:05] thought in mind in your thoughts now.
[1:36:07] And hold to every word as I go through
[1:36:10] this because it's just I had a struggle
[1:36:12] almost left it out.
[1:36:15] But the prophecy in Isaiah says, "Unto
[1:36:19] us a child is born.
[1:36:21] Unto us a son is given and the
[1:36:24] government
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; shall be upon his shoulder." Amen.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; And then Isaiah also 22 says, "And the
[1:36:35] key of the house of David,
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; because he is the son of David,
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; the key of the house of David will I lay
[1:36:43] upon his shoulder.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; And so shall he open
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; and none shall shut."
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; And he shall shut
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; and none shall open. Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Can I just paraphrase it for you a wee
[1:36:59] bit? And he shall open the word.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; He shall open the seals.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; And no man can shut them.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; And why? Because he has the key of
[1:37:12] David.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; He has the authority. He's the only one
[1:37:15] who can do it.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; That's why in heaven when John says,
[1:37:18] "Oh, there's no one to open the book."
[1:37:21] And he turned and and he said, "Don't
[1:37:23] don't weep. The lion of the tribe. The
[1:37:25] lion of the tribe of Judah. He's
[1:37:28] prevailed.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; The lion of the tribe of Judah is the
[1:37:32] son of David. It's kingship. The king
[1:37:35] has prevailed has opened the seals and
[1:37:39] one stood up to receive it because one
[1:37:42] that was going to receive it had to have
[1:37:43] the the price
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; and he had paid it with his blood
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; and he says, "I will come and claim that
[1:37:50] book."
[1:37:51] Listen to me, my dear friends of
[1:37:53] Cloverdale. Your name was in that book.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Your record was in that book.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Your failures were in that book. Your
[1:38:03] sins were in that book. All of your
[1:38:05] weaknesses were in that book. But the
[1:38:07] lamb said, "I will take that book."
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; This is the king.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "I can remember what I want to
[1:38:16] remember and I can forget what I want to
[1:38:19] forget.
[1:38:22] That's the kingdom we're in.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; I'm living in that kingdom.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and God uh God help the
[1:38:31] person try to remove me or remove you
[1:38:33] out of that citizenship.
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; And these prophecies include, are you
[1:38:44] staying with me?
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; I want you wide awake and alert. Don't
[1:38:50] be distracted by anything.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; And he says these these prophecies uh uh
[1:38:56] uh include the first and the second
[1:38:58] coming
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. The first to buy his
[1:39:02] bride and the second one to marry her.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; So that's what the key is all about.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; And that's why it says it's on his
[1:39:11] shoulder
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham goes through
[1:39:13] that in the marriage ceremony. And he
[1:39:16] says, "And unto us a child is born, and
[1:39:19] the government will be upon his
[1:39:21] shoulder."
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; And it says in Isaiah that the key of
[1:39:24] the house of David will I lay upon his
[1:39:27] shoulder.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; And he shall open and no man can shut
[1:39:32] and he can shut and no one shall open.
[1:39:36] Then when the prophet of God comes down
[1:39:38] into the Philadelphiaian church age just
[1:39:41] before the Leodysian church age and he
[1:39:44] goes to the scripture into the angel of
[1:39:46] the church of Philadelphia.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; These things says he that is holy.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; He that is true.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; He that hath the key of David.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; So now we know who has the key of David.
[1:39:59] The Lord Jesus Christ who was revealing
[1:40:01] himself through the church ages in the
[1:40:03] dispensation just passed told that
[1:40:06] generation, "This is the one that has
[1:40:08] the key of David.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And he openeth." He says the same thing
[1:40:13] that Isaiah said, "He opens and no man
[1:40:16] shutth. And he shutth and no man opens."
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; He says, "But what does this key
[1:40:22] signify?"
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; The answer lies in the position of the
[1:40:26] key. It's not in his hand.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; It's not worn around his neck.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; He alone has the use of the key.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; For he alone opens and shuts. And no man
[1:40:39] has that right but Jesus himself.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Where is the key? It's on his shoulder.
[1:40:45] And what does the shoulder have to do
[1:40:47] with it?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; The government shall be upon his
[1:40:50] shoulder.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; He said the phrase the phrase here's the
[1:40:54] lesson. The phrase the government on his
[1:40:57] shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony
[1:41:00] of the east when the bride has been
[1:41:03] committed.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; When the bride has been committed
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; and it happened in this time that the
[1:41:09] bride became committed.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; You have lived in that season.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; We are living in that season. The bride
[1:41:19] has been committed.
[1:41:21] Yeah.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Are you following me yet?
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Here he stands. The key is on his
[1:41:29] shoulder.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; And the bride has been committed.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; That prophecy couldn't take place till
[1:41:35] now.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; People are coming to the realization,
[1:41:41] I'm not a church member. I'm the bride
[1:41:43] of Jesus Christ
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; and I'm a committed one.
[1:41:51] [Applause]
[1:41:53] Nothing can change.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; And the bride is committed to the groom
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; and she takes off her veil
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; and places it over on the groom's
[1:42:03] shoulders
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; where the key was. She takes the veil
[1:42:08] off and puts it on his shoulders,
[1:42:11] signifying that not only is she under
[1:42:14] his dominion,
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; that she has transferred her rights to
[1:42:18] him.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Listen sisters, listen my dear sisters.
[1:42:23] This is the pattern of God that she has
[1:42:25] transferred her rights to him and he is
[1:42:29] the head but also that he bears the
[1:42:33] responsibility.
[1:42:35] Every man, every husband bears the
[1:42:37] responsibility
[1:42:39] of a spiritual headship in his home.
[1:42:43] Hallelujah. And in this church and in
[1:42:46] the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:42:49] and the care and the care and that he
[1:42:54] and he alone, no one else, no other man,
[1:42:58] no other p power has any right and
[1:43:01] responsibility.
[1:43:03] I know we have a social network. I know
[1:43:06] we have social aid. But I really think
[1:43:08] if a man has faith in God, God will
[1:43:12] provide for him and his family.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe that as a
[1:43:17] church?
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; I believe that's the perfect way. Now,
[1:43:20] we need to contend against the other
[1:43:23] kingdom.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Maybe you could say more on that later,
[1:43:31] but anyway.
[1:43:33] And that beloved is the key of David.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; God is sovereign. He forneew by divine
[1:43:40] decree exactly who would be in his
[1:43:43] bride.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; I don't have that power. I don't know
[1:43:46] how many this church could be packed
[1:43:48] with 500 or 600 or 800 or a thousand
[1:43:52] people. I wouldn't know who's the bride
[1:43:54] of Jesus Christ. But our father
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; which art in heaven,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; holy is thy name. Thy kingdom come. You
[1:44:04] know who's in the kingdom. You know
[1:44:06] who's been called and you know who's
[1:44:09] committed.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about commitment, friends.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And I feel at this time, those of you
[1:44:18] that come here to this congregation, you
[1:44:21] don't want to come here just to sit and
[1:44:22] listen to a sermon. You don't want to
[1:44:24] come here just because there's
[1:44:25] friendship or there's fellowship or
[1:44:28] whatever more. You want to come because
[1:44:30] you're committed to a cause.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; You're committed to a vision.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; You're committed. And you know that
[1:44:37] God's call for this age is being
[1:44:40] achieved and accomplished. We're trying
[1:44:42] to do our part.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Not that others aren't.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Don't get that in your mind. But we have
[1:44:48] a call. We have a certain a certain
[1:44:50] mission. Yeah.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; I find that the Apostle Paul,
[1:44:57] Apostle Paul, even though he's been an
[1:44:59] apostle for years, he keeps saying,
[1:45:02] "Apostle Paul,
[1:45:05] uh, called by the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; And I I hesitate to say this, but I can
[1:45:12] tell you I would not be standing here,
[1:45:14] and neither would I even stand in the
[1:45:16] shadow of Apostle Paul. But I said, I'm
[1:45:18] I'm not even in this town by my own
[1:45:21] wish. I'm here by a call of God to do a
[1:45:24] certain thing. And and and brother
[1:45:27] Cydney Jackson stood in a little log
[1:45:29] church and he looked up at the logs. He
[1:45:31] says, "Long, straight, and narrow like
[1:45:34] the people." He said, "Solid, straight
[1:45:38] people grown by." These logs were grown
[1:45:41] by God.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he says, "I don't know
[1:45:46] why, brother Eddie." He said, "I don't
[1:45:48] know why, but he said, uh, the the the
[1:45:51] the spirit of God has a has a mission,
[1:45:55] has a work for this place to do."
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; And I and and I I had no idea of going
[1:46:01] any place even beyond the boundaries of
[1:46:03] Cloverdale. I And we had a little radio
[1:46:06] station. I'm just going back because we
[1:46:08] had the radio station because we were
[1:46:10] burdened for the local area.
[1:46:13] I never dreamed. I never dreamed that
[1:46:16] what would take place has taken place.
[1:46:18] But I say that's all part of the call of
[1:46:22] God. And God called you called you to
[1:46:25] this place not to sit here and listen to
[1:46:27] a service and just enjoy the music. He
[1:46:30] called you to be part of that call.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's part of the call.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; The call is to reach the last elected
[1:46:38] seed.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of it. Amen.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of it.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; I feel it's my right. Your right.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Our right.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; God has made it possible. It's our right
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; to be able to spread that word and get
[1:46:55] it out.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; What a great thing.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; That's that that's the work of the
[1:47:01] kingdom, friends.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; The rest of it is just little things we
[1:47:07] have to do.
[1:47:10] Amen.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; You have to help me so I get through
[1:47:13] this.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; And she's committed to the groom.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; It says, "And then he chose her.
[1:47:23] She did not choose him."
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; He called her.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; I say he called you.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; You did not call him.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; She did not come on her own.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; He died for her.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; He washed her in his own blood. He paid
[1:47:39] the price for her. She belongs to him
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; and to him alone.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. She is wholly committed to him and
[1:47:48] he accepts the obligation.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is her head for Christ is the
[1:47:54] head of his church as Sarah called
[1:47:56] Abraham Lord. Even even so the bride is
[1:48:00] happy that he is her Lord. He speaks and
[1:48:04] she obeys for that is her delight.
[1:48:08] Brother Tom's been speaking on
[1:48:10] obedience. Full obedience. It gives us
[1:48:12] uh uh what to the word
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; gives us right to the word to the tree
[1:48:20] of life.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Full obedience.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; But now take goes even a step further.
[1:48:24] He says she delights in obedience.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Marriage time. In other words, you say,
[1:48:33] "How do we get with this with the two
[1:48:34] kingdoms?" Marriage time is when the
[1:48:37] bridegroom makes known that he is the
[1:48:40] one with the key.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; That's when he makes known.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; And it was the bridegroom. It was your
[1:48:50] bridegroom that was speaking and say,
[1:48:52] "There's been a blast."
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; And I have to go east. I have to go
[1:48:58] west.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; And seven angels come down. This is the
[1:49:02] bridegroom.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; And and what was he? Did he have Did he
[1:49:08] have blonde hair? Did he have another
[1:49:11] color? No, he had white hair
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; showing that he was the judge
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; of a kingdom
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; because he's coming into judgment as the
[1:49:22] king,
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; the son of David.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; He'll be son of David during the
[1:49:27] millennium.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Whether you know it or not, you're
[1:49:29] moving towards the millennium faster
[1:49:31] than you even believe. Amen.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; I want to be in that kingdom.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Do you know when the millennium comes
[1:49:42] and when we get caught away? There's
[1:49:44] only two places to be here in the
[1:49:47] tribulation
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; or caught away in the rapture.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; That's the only two places. There's only
[1:49:52] two kingdoms.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; I think everybody in this room ought to
[1:49:56] say, "I want to be in that rapture
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; at all cost."
[1:50:02] Hallelujah.
[1:50:03] [Music]
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, thy kingdom come.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done on earth as it is in
[1:50:11] heaven.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Give us what we need for our daily
[1:50:14] bread.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Uh we don't need to buy boats and
[1:50:18] cottages and all kinds of things. If God
[1:50:22] gives it to you, fine. I'm not against
[1:50:24] that. I'm just simply saying we don't uh
[1:50:27] lust after the we don't strive after
[1:50:29] that. That's not our our ambition is for
[1:50:32] the kingdom of God.
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; God prospers you. Fine.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; That's fine with me.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Then God has a purpose in it.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; So the veil
[1:50:55] now the marriage has come.
[1:50:57] the marriage time and she's committed
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; and he makes known himself to her.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; I'm the bridegroom.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; That that you felt inside that that that
[1:51:10] attraction.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; I always ask when a young couple begin
[1:51:15] to
[1:51:17] come to know one another and they feel
[1:51:19] that I'm for a certain person, it's what
[1:51:23] what attracted you?
[1:51:28] What is it that attracted you?
[1:51:31] And it should be some godly character.
[1:51:33] It should be some
[1:51:35] something that is from above
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; and we were attracted to him.
[1:51:45] And then here comes the servant
[1:51:48] and the mass has come and oh it's oh oh
[1:51:52] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:51:52] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:51:52] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:51:54] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:51:54] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:51:54] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:51:54] oh and then the secrets of the hearts
[1:51:56] are revealed and public and we hear it
[1:51:59] on the tape and can read it in the book
[1:52:01] and
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; oh it we're so aruck.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; And then that mouth begins to speak
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; and begins to tell us
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; this is the time of the marriage.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the time that
[1:52:14] Rebecca must come to Isaiah.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the time the son as
[1:52:19] we've waited uh now the now the marriage
[1:52:22] must take place
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; and a ceremony must be conducted
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; and he conducts it in invisible union of
[1:52:29] the bride of Jesus Christ and a people
[1:52:32] become aware.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; How do we become aware?
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; From the constitution of our nation.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:40] It tells a great wedding's going to take
[1:52:43] place
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; and that the father's preparing a table
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; and the invitation has gone out
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; and some are too busy. They're busy with
[1:52:52] their business or they're busy with
[1:52:53] their education or they're too busy with
[1:52:56] something and they can't get there.
[1:52:57] They're just too busy with life. Maybe
[1:52:59] they're too busy being lazy.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; I want to be eaten up. Amen.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; I tell you, my brother, my sister,
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; I sometimes think things are wrong with
[1:53:10] me. I I feel the same fervor.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; I did my early 20s. I must do this.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; I must speak this.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; I said this morning, oh God, give me the
[1:53:22] give me the give me the strength of my
[1:53:24] youth to preach this message.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; We're contending for a kingdom and we're
[1:53:29] contending against a kingdom.
[1:53:32] And everything of this world is opposed
[1:53:34] to the kingdom that God has called you
[1:53:37] in.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Try and take away your spirit. Try and
[1:53:41] take away your desire. Try to take away
[1:53:44] your time. Try to take away everything.
[1:53:46] Don't you let him.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; You deny him.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; The veil.
[1:54:02] The veil was torn
[1:54:04] when he made the purchase of you. The
[1:54:06] veil was torn between
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; the Holy of Holies and the people.
[1:54:13] And now he went into the holiest place.
[1:54:16] And he didn't say you can't go in. He
[1:54:18] says come on in.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; He made it accessible to you.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; I've taken full responsibility. Amen.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; The veil was taken away.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Now the inception. Follow it very close
[1:54:40] is a very important part. The inception
[1:54:45] of the kingdom of God. God intended.
[1:54:51] God intended to continue the creation
[1:54:53] through Adam.
[1:54:56] And God blessed him and said unto him,
[1:54:59] "Be fruitful."
[1:55:01] Now I've done this.
[1:55:03] I've created all of this. Now you be
[1:55:06] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[1:55:10] earth. Replenish the earth is simply to
[1:55:12] make it full.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; To complete it, to accomplish what
[1:55:16] started.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Now I've got my image and I make you go
[1:55:21] of the earth. Now you go ahead and fill
[1:55:23] it. Amen.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; And you know that the children the way
[1:55:26] we came was not God's ordained way.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; He had the power to bring them another
[1:55:32] way.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; And so God was commissioning him now you
[1:55:38] fill it. You complete it. You continue
[1:55:41] this creation
[1:55:44] and the power that he was given. And the
[1:55:46] and the prophet said in the fundamental
[1:55:48] foundation for faith. Listen closely
[1:55:51] now. Are you getting weary? No,
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; we get where it's too important. I just
[1:55:54] shut down. We go again. If you want to
[1:55:56] continue on.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; All right. That's three hands. How many
[1:56:00] more hands is? All right.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; He says, "Man was made as a secondary
[1:56:05] God on earth. He was given the power to
[1:56:08] control all things, all elements of the
[1:56:11] earth. Adam was given these powers. But
[1:56:15] then the power that he was given to make
[1:56:18] himself
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; staggering statement. The power he was
[1:56:24] given to make himself in other words to
[1:56:28] reproduce himself.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; The power to make himself is where he
[1:56:33] fell.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; The very power he had to bring forth a
[1:56:38] son and daughters and replenish. Listen
[1:56:40] friends, all the humanity that we see on
[1:56:43] the earth didn't come according to God's
[1:56:45] original way.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; The original way was when Jesus came and
[1:56:52] he saw certain ones. He says, "Follow
[1:56:54] me."
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Follow me. I'll make you fishers of men.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; And he transplanted them from the
[1:57:01] kingdom of this world into the kingdom
[1:57:03] of God.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; I'll prove it to you.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; They became transplanted. Amen.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Displaced persons by the world's
[1:57:14] standard.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And that is where he
[1:57:19] fell." And Adam could speak to the
[1:57:21] winds, it would stop. He could speak to
[1:57:24] the trees and they would obey him. He
[1:57:28] could speak to the wildlife, it would
[1:57:30] obey him. He could speak to the waters,
[1:57:33] every what it was, everything obeyed
[1:57:36] Adam. And before Adam could establish
[1:57:39] the kingdom of God.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; In the earth, Satan entered through the
[1:57:45] serpent.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Seowing his seed from which the kingdoms
[1:57:50] of this world would spring forth.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; In the greatest battle
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; ever fought, he said
[1:58:01] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:58:03] Lucifer.
[1:58:05] what they do. Are you still listening?
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; The pain I went through
[1:58:14] God
[1:58:16] dragging my mind and through this
[1:58:19] message. I don't want you to be I don't
[1:58:22] want you at all to be wearied
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; if it would. I've just closed and we
[1:58:27] start again.
[1:58:29] But I want to finish this part if I
[1:58:31] could. Amen.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; He says that Michael and his angels
[1:58:36] fought.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; You know what? I would I'd take another
[1:58:40] word I've been using. They contended
[1:58:41] with
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; there was contention.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; And they fought
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; with Lucifer and his angels. And he had
[1:58:49] deceived those angels to believe a lie.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; And he fought against them.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; And he could not prevail. and the angels
[1:59:00] and the and the prophet says
[1:59:04] uh the the prophet says uh just let me
[1:59:07] get to it now.
[1:59:15] And then it was thrown down. He says,
[1:59:17] "And they fought against Lucifer and his
[1:59:20] angels. And then it that battle was
[1:59:24] thrown down from heaven, cast out of
[1:59:27] heaven to the earth, and fell on human
[1:59:32] beings.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Hello, friends. Are you a human being?
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; This battle fell upon you.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; You didn't ask for it, but this battle
[1:59:44] fell upon you.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; There's only two powers.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; There was only two in heaven. And it was
[1:59:50] God and righteousness and Satan in
[1:59:52] rebellion.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Satan and his deception. And that battle
[1:59:57] fell upon humans.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; And this is the battle that we have.
[2:00:02] And he went on to say, "And then the
[2:00:05] battle from angels became human battles.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; This is our battle.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; And Satan came to destroy God's
[2:00:15] creation.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; And we're here saying we deny him.
[2:00:20] We deny him that right.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; We see God trying to destroy a son or a
[2:00:24] daughter of God. We claim them. We deny
[2:00:27] it
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; at all cost.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; What might it cost? It'll probably cost
[2:00:32] prayer.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; It may cost fasting.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; It may calling on God.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; It may call calling on the forces,
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; other brothers and sisters. It may call
[2:00:43] on it. But too often we give in.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Well, I guess that's the way it has to
[2:00:47] be. That's not the way it has to be.
[2:00:51] [Applause]
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Peter was in jail. The authorities had
[2:00:55] taken him. Their kingdom of this world
[2:00:58] and of darkness had taken him. And they
[2:01:00] gathered together and had prayer. And
[2:01:02] they're praying for Peter to come out.
[2:01:04] And Peter came out. And they wouldn't
[2:01:06] stop praying till he came out.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, we have another way or we
[2:01:13] have something else we can do." Listen
[2:01:15] my friend, my brother, my sister, let's
[2:01:17] not surrender up
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; to the kingdom of this world.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; He says, "And then the battle begins
[2:01:27] here on earth and begin in us and it's
[2:01:31] been raging here ever since."
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Right? our forefather Adam.
[2:01:36] As soon as he lost that power and soon
[2:01:40] as he lost that power to create himself
[2:01:43] to bring himself forth and he lost it,
[2:01:46] the battle began to rage right then. It
[2:01:49] fell.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; And Satan, Lucifer, used a serpent
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; who God had made because he allowed all
[2:01:57] of these things to happen.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; You know why he allowed it to happen?
[2:02:01] because he knew you and I would come
[2:02:02] forth in this last age. And he intended
[2:02:05] that you and I would be victorious
[2:02:08] because we would hear a word that would
[2:02:10] strengthen you, that would open your
[2:02:12] eyes and your understanding, and we
[2:02:14] would not cower to the kingdom of this
[2:02:16] world.
[2:02:17] [Music]
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; You young men and young ladies, don't
[2:02:21] you cower.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Satan will throw every delight your way.
[2:02:25] Don't give in to him.
[2:02:30] Hallelujah.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Please just bear with me a little bit.
[2:02:38] And so the battle raged in the mind of
[2:02:41] Eve.
[2:02:44] the process. The prophet said,
[2:02:47] she looked
[2:02:49] and then
[2:02:51] she began to think
[2:02:56] and as she began to think, her mind got
[2:03:00] changed.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; When her mind was changed, she entered
[2:03:05] into the act
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; and that's how it happened.
[2:03:12] And that thought happens today.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Two seeds and two kingdoms. Pray. God
[2:03:29] help me and God help you. I've just got
[2:03:31] to finish this up to a certain point.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord God said unto the
[2:03:36] serpent, because thou hast done this,
[2:03:40] thou art cursed above all cattle, and
[2:03:43] every beast of the field, upon thy belly
[2:03:45] shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat
[2:03:48] all the days of thy life. And I will put
[2:03:51] enmity, contention between thee and the
[2:03:55] woman, and between thy seed and her
[2:03:59] seed, thy seed, serpent, and her seed,
[2:04:02] the seed of the woman. and it shall
[2:04:04] bruise thy head. The woman's seed will
[2:04:07] bruise your head. And the word is
[2:04:09] actually will crush your head and thy
[2:04:13] and thou shalt bruise his heel.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; The seed of the woman was none other
[2:04:20] than Jesus Christ.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; And so now here's the contention. I'll
[2:04:24] put contention between these seeds. And
[2:04:27] Adam found out I like what one brother
[2:04:29] said when they talked about Jesus and
[2:04:31] those that were rose up against him.
[2:04:34] They said, "Who was it that was trying
[2:04:37] to bruise him?" That was no big mystery.
[2:04:39] Who who was holding stones in their
[2:04:41] hands?
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Who who wanted to bruise him?
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; That was another seed that come from
[2:04:46] another. I tell you what, friends,
[2:04:47] that's why we don't want to have any
[2:04:48] part of that. We're not here to destroy
[2:04:51] people. We're here to build up the body
[2:04:53] of Jesus Christ. We don't know who they
[2:04:56] are. And we just say, "Oh God, I know
[2:04:59] one thing that all of yours that are
[2:05:01] yours, none will, no man can pluck them
[2:05:04] out of your hand."
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; And and then and then the prophet said
[2:05:10] in the spoken word, listen to this
[2:05:12] closely. As Adam found his wife pregnant
[2:05:16] with the seed of death of Satan's lie,
[2:05:20] she had accepted.
[2:05:22] Joseph found his wife pregnant with the
[2:05:25] seed of God, which was the word she had
[2:05:28] accepted.
[2:05:30] [Applause]
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Adam, the first Adam, found his wife
[2:05:36] pregnant with the seed of Satan, which
[2:05:38] she accepted. And Joseph found his wife
[2:05:42] pregnant with the seed of almighty God
[2:05:45] by the word she accepted.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; That principle applies today. If we want
[2:05:50] the benefits of God, accept the word of
[2:05:53] God.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; It comes from that promise.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; And thus commenced
[2:06:03] to build Satan commenced to build his
[2:06:06] kingdom. And as I said before, the
[2:06:08] kingdom is is his domain.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; And here's how it went. And I'm going to
[2:06:16] be brief as I need you to follow very
[2:06:18] closely.
[2:06:19] And the sons of Ham, Kush,
[2:06:24] uh, Ms. Misraam,
[2:06:27] and Foot and Canaan. And Kush begat Nam
[2:06:31] Nam Nimrod
[2:06:33] and he began to be a mighty one in the
[2:06:37] earth
[2:06:39] and the beginning of his kingdom. It's
[2:06:42] the first time it appears in the Bible.
[2:06:45] Satan was the first to get to Eve.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; He's the first to do a lot of things.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; He got to He got into Israel before
[2:06:54] Jesus did.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; He got to Eve before Adam did. And now
[2:06:59] he starts building a kingdom before God
[2:07:02] even can get his kingdom established.
[2:07:05] And the beginning of his kingdom was
[2:07:07] Babel.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; The beginning of his kingdom was
[2:07:12] confusion. It's still confusion.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; The building of his kingdom was a whole
[2:07:16] myriad of voices. And it's still a whole
[2:07:19] myriad of voices. I don't care where you
[2:07:21] hear. Oh, you ought to do this and you
[2:07:24] should do that and listen to the still
[2:07:26] small voice. God has a voice. It's
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; not the voice of your neighbor or the
[2:07:32] voice of someone else. It's the voice of
[2:07:34] God.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says in God's only
[2:07:45] provided place of worship. Notice
[2:07:48] nothing in the Bible types the
[2:07:50] denominations but Babylon.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; So there was the beginning of the
[2:07:56] kingdom. The beginning of Nimrod's
[2:07:58] kingdom was Babel. And now we come all
[2:08:01] these thousands of years. And you have a
[2:08:03] prophet saying nothing in the world
[2:08:07] types that Babel but Babylon.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; And Babylon was founded by Nimrod.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; And Nimrod was a renegade
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; in the Ephesian church age. He says,
[2:08:23] "Now, to get the real meaning of what
[2:08:24] we're about to go into, I must caution
[2:08:28] you to ever keep in mind that religion
[2:08:32] matters uh that keep in mind that
[2:08:36] religion, spiritual matters, if you
[2:08:39] like, is composed of two parts.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Religion is composed of two parts
[2:08:46] that intertwine
[2:08:48] but are as opposite as black and white.
[2:08:51] Religion and the spiritual world are
[2:08:54] made up of those two trees
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; which had their roots in Eden. Both the
[2:08:59] tree of life
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; and the tree of knowledge of good and
[2:09:03] evil. Remember it is the tree of
[2:09:05] knowledge of good
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; and evil.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; You're all going to go out and I imagine
[2:09:12] most every one of you going to go into a
[2:09:14] car. That's good. But it's also evil.
[2:09:19] You may turn on a radio and hear some
[2:09:21] news or hear the weather or hear the
[2:09:24] traffic report. That's good. But it's
[2:09:26] also evil.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; You're going to go to the store and
[2:09:30] you're going to eat food. It's going to
[2:09:32] be good. Much of it's been refined till
[2:09:35] it's evil.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; And he says the spiritual world are made
[2:09:43] up of those two trees which had their
[2:09:45] roots in Eden. Both the tree of life and
[2:09:48] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[2:09:51] stood in the midst of the garden and no
[2:09:54] doubt their very branches intertwined
[2:09:58] with each other.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; You know I guess maybe some people
[2:10:05] excuse me I have to I have to just plow
[2:10:09] along here. Maybe some I don't know if
[2:10:12] some stood in Eden and if they saw those
[2:10:15] trees and saw their branches intertwined
[2:10:17] and they said well which is which
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[2:10:28] This is where I would like to come to
[2:10:31] you. I'll just give you a little a
[2:10:33] little quote to think about
[2:10:35] and this is why I couldn't come to it
[2:10:38] because it is so
[2:10:41] it is so invading in every part of every
[2:10:44] life
[2:10:46] mine, yours, every home, every church.
[2:10:53] Satan is the master
[2:10:56] deceiver,
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; deception.
[2:10:59] And if it is possible, Jesus said he
[2:11:02] deceived the very elect.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Those are are are import those are
[2:11:07] potent words.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; And he is so successful that he has
[2:11:15] multitudes of people
[2:11:18] who believe they're in his kingdom,
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; but they believe they're in the other
[2:11:23] kingdom.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Now, that is a real master stroke of
[2:11:27] deception.
[2:11:30] I never want to be there.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; I I I'm I'm really going to come down
[2:11:38] right where we are.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't get
[2:11:44] uh
[2:11:47] don't feel I'm imposing something. But
[2:11:49] how do you know you're not in the
[2:11:51] kingdom of How do you know you're not in
[2:11:52] Satan's kingdom?
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; I have a reason for asking. How do you
[2:11:57] know? You have the Baptist church is
[2:12:00] over here and the free Methodists is
[2:12:01] over there and they believe they're in
[2:12:03] the kingdom of God just like you do. And
[2:12:05] those over there believe they're in the
[2:12:07] kingdom of God. They don't agree with
[2:12:08] each other, but they believe they're in
[2:12:09] the kingdom of God.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; And the Catholic people believe they're
[2:12:13] in the kingdom of God for sure. And the
[2:12:15] churches all over this country. What
[2:12:17] makes you think you're in the kingdom of
[2:12:19] God? Because they believe they're in the
[2:12:21] kingdom of God.
[2:12:24] Well, it would come down to
[2:12:29] what is it that you believe?
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; And they would open up the Bible and
[2:12:35] they'd say, "Baptize in the name of the
[2:12:36] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." And that's
[2:12:38] how I was baptized. And that's right in
[2:12:39] the word of God. And that's why I'm in
[2:12:41] the kingdom of God. I received Jesus
[2:12:43] Christ. I repented of my sins. I shed
[2:12:46] tears at the altar. And that's why I'm
[2:12:48] in the kingdom of God. I repented like
[2:12:50] you repented.
[2:12:54] Okay. It it starts getting sticky,
[2:12:56] doesn't it?
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; And maybe they were more sincere than
[2:13:01] even you were.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; And you could tell some some people
[2:13:07] would say, "I called out on God. I
[2:13:08] screamed. I was so miserable in my
[2:13:11] life." And furthermore, there was a
[2:13:13] dramatic change
[2:13:15] and transformation.
[2:13:18] You say, "Wow, that's what happened to
[2:13:20] me.
[2:13:23] And then you say, "Well,
[2:13:27] what is what is the it it get down?
[2:13:30] You're in the kingdom of God. I'm in the
[2:13:31] kingdom of God." Now, what is it really
[2:13:34] when we get right down to the short
[2:13:37] strokes where the rubber hits the road?
[2:13:40] What is it that you believe? What What
[2:13:43] do you believe about
[2:13:46] Malachi 4?
[2:13:48] What do you believe? Because that's key.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; This isn't just small stuff. This is
[2:13:53] key. This is important.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe that was John the
[2:13:57] Baptist. Oh, this is where things start
[2:13:59] pulling apart.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; What do you believe about revelation?
[2:14:03] What do you believe? What do you believe
[2:14:04] about a prophet of God coming in this
[2:14:07] generation?
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; And then you start finding out the ways
[2:14:12] have parted. Yes.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; So now the critical the critical
[2:14:18] the critical point is
[2:14:22] this becomes the critical point either
[2:14:25] this that you have hung all your eternal
[2:14:28] destiny on. Either it's remember there's
[2:14:31] only two kingdoms.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; There's and there's only a rapture and a
[2:14:36] tribulation
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; and there's only a heaven and a hell.
[2:14:42] There's no big gray area here, folks.
[2:14:44] Leodys has made everything kind of gray.
[2:14:46] You're this way. We just accept you and
[2:14:48] everybody loves Jesus and everybody.
[2:14:50] That's nonsense.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; They don't love Jesus. Jesus is the
[2:14:53] word.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; So now it becomes critical. And this is
[2:15:01] why this is why we so treasure I so
[2:15:06] treasure. We talk about tapes, books,
[2:15:08] this that the other thing. It's not
[2:15:09] textbooks, just those things. It is that
[2:15:12] God
[2:15:14] our father which are in heaven.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Holy is your name.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; It's a holy thing that you had brother
[2:15:23] Brandham born. It's a holy thing that he
[2:15:26] heard a voice in a tree. It's a holy
[2:15:29] thing when you said don't drink or smoke
[2:15:31] or defile your body in any way. It was a
[2:15:33] holy thing when he began to go to the
[2:15:36] people and give his life and not even
[2:15:38] knowing where he was going. It was a
[2:15:40] holy thing when he was out in Arizona
[2:15:43] and the seven angels come. That's a holy
[2:15:45] thing that a holy God did.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; You know how important that is? That's
[2:15:51] the only thing that separates you from
[2:15:53] everyone else.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And for that reason and that
[2:16:00] reason alone, we are in the kingdom of
[2:16:03] God.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; And if you take that away,
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; I can tell you if you took that away,
[2:16:09] I'd walk out these doors. You have no
[2:16:11] more idea. Everybody's got religion.
[2:16:14] Everybody's got Everybody sings songs
[2:16:16] the same songs we sing. Everybody prays.
[2:16:19] Everybody's sincere.
[2:16:22] Everybody gives and they tithe. And all
[2:16:24] that has nothing to do with that. It's
[2:16:27] what are you doing with the
[2:16:28] Constitution?
[2:16:32] [Music]
[2:16:35] [Applause]
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; It's going to be 10 more minutes. I'm
[2:16:44] going to quit
[2:16:52] in Israel in the church. Brother
[2:16:54] Brandham said, "Just look at that
[2:16:56] spirit, how it rose up back there." I I
[2:16:59] I just love the way Brother Brandham can
[2:17:02] can distill something and put it into
[2:17:04] three, four lines. Amen.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; He said that spirit, how it rose up back
[2:17:10] there in Cain,
[2:17:13] how it came on down through Ham.
[2:17:16] How out it went through Nimrod
[2:17:20] into Babylon,
[2:17:22] out of Babylon, came on down into the
[2:17:26] days of the coming of Jesus. Amen.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; And he said they were teachers and they
[2:17:31] were scholars and they were wise men
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't recognize him.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; And the same thing and has come down to
[2:17:40] this day. This is the day.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:17:49] if I can just have 10 minutes
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; and then I'm going to close. Now that
[2:17:54] was how that other kingdom. I want to
[2:17:56] just talk a little bit more about our
[2:17:58] kingdom.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; The first Adam failed. So the second
[2:18:03] Adam had to come.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus was coming, he was coming
[2:18:07] for all of his citizens.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; And if you're sitting here today as a
[2:18:11] citizen of this kingdom, this all
[2:18:13] happened for you.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm reading part of your history.
[2:18:18] And the scripture says that the spirit
[2:18:20] of Elijah was on John the Baptist.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; And John the Baptist came and the first
[2:18:26] thing he starts out by saying, "Repent
[2:18:28] ye
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus came and was baptized of
[2:18:36] John in a voice from heaven saying, "Lo,
[2:18:40] this is my beloved son."
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're starting all over
[2:18:44] again.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Adam was a son. Now we have the second
[2:18:47] Adam. And a voice, "Oh God,
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; our father in heaven spoke,
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; this is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[2:18:58] pleased. This is the second Adam. This
[2:19:01] is the seed of the woman. This is the
[2:19:02] one that'll crush the serpent's head.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; This is the beginning of the creation."
[2:19:07] Notice, plays the phrase, the beginning
[2:19:09] of the creation of God.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:13] And immediately after that, notice the
[2:19:15] sequence, please. John,
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus baptized, and the voice saying,
[2:19:20] "This is my son."
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; The next thing that happens in your
[2:19:23] Bible is that Satan and the devil taketh
[2:19:27] him up into an exceeding high mountain.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't take him to a tree. He didn't
[2:19:34] take Eve to
[2:19:37] He took Eve to a tree. Says, "Look at
[2:19:40] this now. He's taking the second son of
[2:19:43] Adam. I'm sorry that he's taking the
[2:19:45] second son of God, the second Adam to a
[2:19:47] high mountain
[2:19:49] and showeth him
[2:19:52] all the kingdoms
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; of the world.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Look what I've done.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Look what happened
[2:20:04] since first Adam.
[2:20:07] I came in through Cain,
[2:20:11] through Ham,
[2:20:14] through Nimrod.
[2:20:17] And look at the kingdoms of the world.
[2:20:19] Look at the power. Look at the glory.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Look at the wealth. Look what they've
[2:20:24] dug out of the earth. Look at the gold.
[2:20:26] Look at the gems. Look at the majesty.
[2:20:29] Look at the Look at all of these things.
[2:20:31] I'll give you
[2:20:33] all these kingdoms.
[2:20:36] And all Jesus had, he just called one
[2:20:39] man. The Holy Spirit came on one man.
[2:20:44] The one voice
[2:20:47] and he says to the people, "Repent."
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God's at hand.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Right
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; now, it's it's it's right at hand.
[2:20:58] And then in a day or two, Jesus comes to
[2:21:00] him
[2:21:02] and is baptized of him and he rises up
[2:21:05] out of the baptism in a voice,
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; "Behold, this is my son."
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; That was enough to stir the gates of
[2:21:14] hell
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; and the devil comes and takes them right
[2:21:17] up into a high mountain.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Look what I've done.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Look at the kingdoms of the world. And
[2:21:24] if you'll fall down and worship me, I'll
[2:21:26] give you all of this. And Jesus did said
[2:21:30] what you need to say. Get behind me,
[2:21:33] Satan.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Get h Satan.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; He'll come to you with his whispers.
[2:21:39] He'll come to you with clear language
[2:21:41] and want you to bow to him. Bow to his
[2:21:44] system. You say, "Get hints."
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; And if you mean it like Jesus meant it,
[2:21:50] the Bible says, "And he did. He departed
[2:21:52] for a season.
[2:21:55] [Music]
[2:22:05] And Jesus said to him, "Get hence."
[2:22:08] And then from that time,
[2:22:11] from that time, are you following the
[2:22:14] sequence I'm teaching? From that time,
[2:22:20] Jesus began to preach.
[2:22:24] Yes.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Same message,
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; same words. Jesus began to preach.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; What is it? The kingdom's coming.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; He said, repent
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus began to preach. Repent for the
[2:22:41] kingdom of heaven is at hand. I'm I'm
[2:22:43] hurry because I'm rushing out of time
[2:22:45] here. I'm rushing out of time. I meant
[2:22:47] it that way.
[2:22:49] And from those days, John the Bapt from
[2:22:52] the from the days of John the Baptist
[2:22:54] until now, the kingdom of heaven
[2:22:56] suffereth violence, and the violent take
[2:22:58] it by force. And he and then he began to
[2:23:02] heal the sick that are therein. And and
[2:23:05] he sent out the disciples, and he said,
[2:23:06] "And say unto them, the kingdom of God
[2:23:09] has come nigh to you." Soon as he sent
[2:23:11] the disciples and healings begin to take
[2:23:14] place, he he said, "The kingdom of God
[2:23:17] has come nigh to you." What happened
[2:23:19] when the prophet of God came and began
[2:23:21] to have multitudes
[2:23:23] coming and healings were taking place?
[2:23:26] What was God saying? The kingdom of God
[2:23:28] has come nigh.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; The message is approaching.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; The word is coming.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; The constitution is going to be made
[2:23:40] known.
[2:23:43] [Music]
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; And he answered Matthew 13:11. And he
[2:23:47] answered and said to them, because it is
[2:23:49] given, he said to the disciples, it's
[2:23:51] given unto you that to know the
[2:23:53] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but
[2:23:56] to them it is not given. Then he said,
[2:23:58] verily I say unto you, there be some
[2:24:01] standing here, listen closely now,
[2:24:03] really pinch your conscience, there be
[2:24:05] some standing here, Jesus said 2,000
[2:24:08] years ago, which shall not taste death
[2:24:10] till they see the Son of Man coming in
[2:24:15] his kingdom.
[2:24:18] The kingdom is. And when he came, he
[2:24:20] came in a changed body.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; And he stood right on on Mount
[2:24:25] Transfiguration in a glorified body. The
[2:24:28] kingdom of God.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Let me say to you, in the name of the
[2:24:32] Lord Jesus Christ, this kingdom that I'm
[2:24:35] preaching about has a glorified body for
[2:24:38] you.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Does that mean anything to you?
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; A glorified body. We'll not have these
[2:24:47] pains and aches, brother Abe, anymore.
[2:24:49] This kingdom has a glorified body for
[2:24:52] you.
[2:24:55] [Music]
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:01] [Music]
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, I'm moving quickly.
[2:25:06] He says to Peter, "And I will give unto
[2:25:09] thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
[2:25:13] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[2:25:15] shall be bound whatsoever thou shalt
[2:25:19] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven."
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; And when he was demanded of the
[2:25:23] Pharisees, when the kingdom of God
[2:25:25] should come, he answered them and said,
[2:25:27] "The kingdom of God cometh not with
[2:25:30] observation."
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Luke 17:21, "Neither shall
[2:25:34] they say, lo here, lo there, for behold
[2:25:37] the kingdom of God." Do you hear the
[2:25:40] words of Jesus?
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Do you hear Jesus here speaking to you,
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; not me? I'm reading his words. Jesus is
[2:25:47] saying to you, the kingdom of God is
[2:25:50] within you.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; The mount transfiguration, his
[2:25:53] experience is within you. Amen.
[2:25:56] [Music]
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; You are born again people. You are very
[2:26:06] very unique group.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; You're in this world but as Jesus said
[2:26:11] not of this world.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; I'm no more in the world but these are
[2:26:17] in the world.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; And I come to thee holy father keep
[2:26:20] through thine own name.
[2:26:23] John 17:14, "I have given them thy word,
[2:26:27] and the world hateth them because they
[2:26:30] are not of the world."
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; So many things that we engage in, so
[2:26:35] many things that take up our time and
[2:26:38] consume us. I'm just more conscious all
[2:26:40] the time. It's just this world. We deal
[2:26:43] with it as we need to, touch it as we
[2:26:46] need to, but don't become engaged with
[2:26:48] it. And above all things, don't let it
[2:26:51] affect you. Amen.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; It's just this world.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; If we live by every precept of God, God
[2:26:58] will provide.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; God will protect.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; God will heal. God will deliver. It's a
[2:27:05] part of our kingdom. I want to bring you
[2:27:07] to this deliverance. I want to bring you
[2:27:09] to this kind of miracle working power.
[2:27:13] [Music]
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; They are not of this world, even as I am
[2:27:23] not of the world.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; My kingdom is not of this world. Jesus
[2:27:27] said, if my kingdom was of this world,
[2:27:30] my servants would fight that I should
[2:27:33] not be delivered to the Jews.
[2:27:36] And Paul said, who hath delivered us?
[2:27:41] who hath delivered us from the power of
[2:27:44] darkness
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; and hath translated us into the kingdom
[2:27:48] of his dear son.
[2:27:51] And the prophet said this in closing.
[2:27:54] And when we are born again,
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; you are of heaven
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; and of God. You're citizens of the
[2:28:01] kingdom of God. And the Holy Spirit that
[2:28:04] dwelleth in there that comes into you
[2:28:06] will make you act and look and think it
[2:28:09] does it. that nation where we're going
[2:28:13] to.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Well, friends,
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; I live under the laws of Canada. You
[2:28:25] live under the laws of United States,
[2:28:27] many of you.
[2:28:30] But we're citizens.
[2:28:32] Yes.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; When you take your passport out and hand
[2:28:36] it to the border control officer, just
[2:28:40] remember you have another passport.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; That passport will never give you a
[2:28:45] transformed body.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; That passport can't get you out of some
[2:28:49] of the trouble that we as humans can get
[2:28:52] into.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; But I have another Do you know what
[2:28:55] friends? This message has plenty of
[2:28:57] power in it. It needs to be preached
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; and preached until the people believe
[2:29:02] it.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; And once it once the people believe it
[2:29:05] and are committed to it, you'll see
[2:29:07] things happen amongst us you didn't even
[2:29:09] believe was possible.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; He's a God of the impossible.
[2:29:14] [Applause]
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to our great one.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Our friends from the Philippines. You
[2:29:32] believe it?
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:43] [Music]
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Jim.
[2:29:48] I I see that that gives me gives just
[2:29:51] gives me urges me on
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; and that's 1:00 and I said I'd close and
[2:29:57] so I'm going to close.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Why don't you turn around and shake
[2:30:11] hands with a citizen of another country,
[2:30:14] the same country you're in.
[2:30:17] Canadians can hug Americans and back and
[2:30:19] forth. We don't even belong to these
[2:30:21] countries. We belong to another country.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come, John, shake my hand.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Brother Ernie, I
[2:30:34] got to shake hands with a You're not
[2:30:36] American.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; And I'm not a Canadian.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; We believe it.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; I believe it all my heart.
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got the same president.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Well, what should we sing?
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; I thought I thought we'd have all kinds
[2:31:00] of songs here that All right.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; I pledge allegiance.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; All right. Wonderful. All right.
[2:31:12] Come and help me, brother.
[2:31:16] Why don't you help me, brother
[2:31:19] Kim? Can you help me with that? I pledge
[2:31:21] allegiance.
[2:31:22] My voice is gone.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; Pledge allegiance to the lamb.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; What country are you from?
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; in heaven.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; This doesn't make you happy, friends.
[2:31:43] This is the truth.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; This is the truth.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; And I want to inform you that the laws
[2:31:50] of our land can overpower the laws of
[2:31:53] our country are higher and greater than
[2:31:56] the laws. We live by the law. I believe
[2:31:58] we should live by the laws of this land.
[2:32:01] But we have a law that's greater than
[2:32:03] this law.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; I agree with it as far as it can go.
[2:32:10] Right.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; When they start marrying the same sex
[2:32:13] marriages here in New Westminster, I
[2:32:15] don't agree with that.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Do you? No.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; We're with one voice.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; No, we don't agree with it.
[2:32:24] [Music]
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; We're against it.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; Sorry, folks.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; That's where the law doesn't agree. And
[2:32:31] if they come here and said, "You have to
[2:32:33] you have to agree to that. You're a
[2:32:35] citizen of this country." I say, "Well,
[2:32:37] tear up my passport or do what you want.
[2:32:40] This is what I believe. And if you can
[2:32:41] find it here, I'm with you."
[2:32:44] [Music]
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; All right. I pledge allegiance.
[2:32:54] [Music]
[2:32:57] I pledge
[2:32:59] alance
[2:33:01] to the land
[2:33:04] with all my strength.
[2:33:08] With all my
[2:33:11] I

[2:35:11] to come
[2:35:14] to
[2:35:15] this world
[2:35:17] to embrace
[2:35:19] the cross.
[2:35:21] One by one, let us

[2:36:35] [Music]
[2:36:41] to
[2:36:45] [Music]
[2:36:47] the lamb of God.
[2:36:50] The Lord my
[2:36:54] to my place
[2:36:57] and the Lord my
[2:37:00] I see
[2:37:04] his
[2:37:07] [Music]
[2:37:11] toes.
[2:37:12] [Music]
[2:37:18] [Music]
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; I address you as citizens of another
[2:37:23] country.
[2:37:24] [Music]
[2:37:26] Not just because we had the service that
[2:37:28] we had today,
[2:37:30] but because it's in my heart. You are
[2:37:32] indeed citizens of another country. And
[2:37:34] I'm going to pray now that that will be
[2:37:38] imprinted upon your mind. And as you go
[2:37:41] about your daily life, you will confess,
[2:37:46] you will act and live
[2:37:49] under the dictates
[2:37:52] of that kingdom.
[2:37:55] May God ever lead you. Heavenly Father,
[2:37:59] our Father, which art in heaven, we say,
[2:38:03] "Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,
[2:38:07] and thy will be done on earth.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; And we are the ones that you have chosen
[2:38:11] that might do your will here on earth.
[2:38:14] May it be done as it is in heaven. Give
[2:38:17] us this day our daily bread, oh God. Let
[2:38:19] us not be subjected to the economies of
[2:38:22] this world. But we are subjected, oh
[2:38:24] God, and living under the blessings of
[2:38:27] your economy. Forgive us our sins and
[2:38:30] our debts, oh God, as we forgive others.
[2:38:32] This is your justice system. If we do
[2:38:35] not forgive, then are we are not
[2:38:37] forgiven. Oh God, we thank you for this
[2:38:40] glorious justice. Thank you for the
[2:38:42] blood, oh God, that has cleansed us,
[2:38:44] Father. And I pray, dear Lord, that
[2:38:47] you'll be pleased with this group of
[2:38:48] people as we will soon leave the
[2:38:51] sanctuary of this building. All of those
[2:38:54] over the internet, oh God, in the rooms,
[2:38:56] in the gatherings, wherever they might
[2:38:59] be, we speak peace to them in Jesus
[2:39:02] Christ's name. We speak blessings to
[2:39:04] them. We speak healing, oh God, to those
[2:39:08] that are sick and afflicted because this
[2:39:10] is part of the kingdom. I wonder those
[2:39:13] that are standing here in this audience,
[2:39:15] you want to raise your hand at this
[2:39:17] time. Somebody may be saying, "I'm
[2:39:19] sick." Someone else may be saying, "I
[2:39:21] need deliverance. I need peace of mind.
[2:39:24] I need to be free from this depression."
[2:39:27] Whatever it is of this other kingdom,
[2:39:29] I'm confused. Whatever it may be that's
[2:39:32] not of the kingdom of God, we have a
[2:39:34] right to banish it. Whatsoever we bind
[2:39:38] on earth shall be bound in heaven. We
[2:39:40] bind these spirits. We bind these evil
[2:39:43] works. We bind these enticements of the
[2:39:46] world. We bind this tempter in the name
[2:39:50] of Jesus Christ. Satan, you are rendered
[2:39:53] powerless before this word that I hold
[2:39:56] in my hand and before this word and this
[2:39:58] message which I hold in my heart and the
[2:40:01] people hold in their heart. And now they
[2:40:04] are strengthened. Oh God, they are
[2:40:05] instructed. I pray that the Holy Ghost
[2:40:09] will go with each one. Oh Lord, you as
[2:40:11] their teacher and as their comforter and
[2:40:15] you will lead them, Father, in all
[2:40:17] grace, I pray
[2:40:20] Jesus, as we prepare ourselves for the
[2:40:22] coming days and the camp which will soon
[2:40:24] be upon us, let this camp be like no
[2:40:27] other time.
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:40:31] walk down these trails,
[2:40:33] into the chapel, into the kitchen.
[2:40:37] Oh God.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; Oh God. May people meet with you.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; May they talk with you and you talk back
[2:40:44] to them.
[2:40:45] &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, there will be a a a
[2:40:47] presence over that campground such as
[2:40:49] never has been in the times we've been
[2:40:52] there. Father granted. I pray you'll
[2:40:55] bless your people now. Bless them in
[2:40:56] their giving as they give, Father, to
[2:40:59] the Lord's work. We thank you for it in
[2:41:01] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:05] And the people said, "Amen."
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We dismiss you in the
[2:41:10] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:15] You want to go? You want to stay?
[2:41:18] You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:41:22] [Music]
[2:41:26] Nice, brother Kim.
[2:41:34] [Music]
[2:42:40] Hallelujah.
