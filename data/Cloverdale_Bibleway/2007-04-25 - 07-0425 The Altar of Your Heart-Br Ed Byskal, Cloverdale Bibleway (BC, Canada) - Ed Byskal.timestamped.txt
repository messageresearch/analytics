[6:59] good to have you back with us. Brother
[7:00] Tony if you'd come and lead us in prayer
[7:03] this evening.
[7:05] want to remember a prayer request. Uh
[7:08] we've got several prayer cloths up here
[7:09] to pray over and one that specifically a
[7:12] lady had written in and asked if we
[7:14] would pray over this prayer cloth this
[7:16] evening. We trust that each of you that
[7:19] have a desire and need on your heart
[7:20] tonight can reach out and touch the hem
[7:23] of the garment of the master as he's in
[7:26] our presence this evening.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we want to remember in prayer
[7:33] brother Gordon in Bishop Falls,
[7:36] Newfoundland. Bring you greetings from
[7:38] the saints in New Brunswick and also in
[7:42] Bishop Falls and also St. John's
[7:44] Newfoundland. Our brother Gordon, he's
[7:46] plagued with a kidney stone. He really
[7:48] needs a deliverance. So we want to join
[7:50] our hearts together. Raise your hand in
[7:53] faith to the Lord tonight as well.
[7:56] Oh, Father,
[7:58] how wonderful it is to be in your
[8:00] presence once again. The place where we
[8:03] originated from. The place where we came
[8:05] from, that we're feeling the pull back
[8:07] to once again. Oh, this is a little bit
[8:10] like heaven for us down here in this
[8:12] this evil world in which we live in this
[8:15] weary land that we are just sojouring
[8:18] through. Lord Jesus, how we live for
[8:20] these times to come into the house of
[8:22] God. how we live for these times to open
[8:25] our mouths and praise your name, Father,
[8:28] to give you glory, to give you honor, to
[8:30] give you praise, Lord, for the eyes to
[8:33] have seen who who we are and where we
[8:35] are in time in these last days. Oh, your
[8:38] mercies are new every morning. Oh,
[8:40] you're faithful. Morning by morning, we
[8:43] see, oh God, your grace extended to us
[8:46] and how you've kept us safe today and
[8:48] how you've kept us from temptation and
[8:50] how you've brought us to the house of
[8:52] God again to Lord hear words of life,
[8:55] words that elevate us into heavenly
[8:58] places as we hear our place in Christ.
[9:01] Oh, Father, we're honored to be in your
[9:03] presence. We pray that you're pleased to
[9:06] dwell in the praises of your people as
[9:08] well. Oh, Father, we're here tonight.
[9:10] Uh, Lord Jesus, remember different ones
[9:13] that are in need. You you see the hands.
[9:16] You see by faith, Lord, the people who
[9:19] who are raising, reaching out to you for
[9:22] an a moment of need as we also remember
[9:25] our sister who sent in this prayer
[9:27] request and the prayer closet are here
[9:29] and our brother Gordon in Newfoundland,
[9:30] Lord, with this kidney stone. Just Lord
[9:33] Jesus, break that thing up and dissolve
[9:35] it in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh Lord
[9:38] Jesus, many other needs here as well
[9:41] from around the world that we could hold
[9:42] up before you, Lord. But you know them
[9:45] all, even before we would ask or think.
[9:47] And so, Father, we're confident that you
[9:50] who have begun a good work will perform
[9:52] it until the day of Jesus Christ. Lord,
[9:54] be with Brother Tom and Sister Joanne.
[9:56] Is there a way? Refresh them and
[9:58] strengthen them, we pray. And Lord, for
[10:01] the word tonight as brother Ed would
[10:02] come and Lord unbburden his heart with
[10:05] the word that you gave to him. Lord
[10:07] allow him to have strength and clarity
[10:10] of thought and Lord let the man step
[10:12] aside that you might speak through him
[10:14] to us. Lord we need your word. It is the
[10:18] bread of life upon which we live as we
[10:20] ask all these mercies now in the name of
[10:23] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. As
[10:29] you have your seats this evening,
[10:33] we do have two announcements we need to
[10:35] make you aware of. Our sister Elizabeth
[10:37] Neighbor has a special for us, so if
[10:38] she'd come this evening and get ready.
[10:41] Uh the Bible Waych Christian Academy
[10:43] wants to invite all those that would
[10:44] like to attend. They're hosting a
[10:46] science fair tomorrow evening at 7 PM in
[10:50] the fellowship hall. That'll be
[10:52] Thursday, April 26th. Everyone is
[10:54] welcome and uh want to celebrate all the
[10:57] work that the students at BCA have been
[11:00] able to accomplish thus far this year.
[11:03] And we have an announcement for the
[11:05] young people that there will be a young
[11:07] people's meeting this Friday night,
[11:09] April 27th at 7:30 p.m. here at the
[11:12] church with brother John Andes. So, God
[11:14] bless you to each one of you this
[11:16] evening.
[11:25] [Music]
[11:40] The sands
[11:42] have been washed
[11:44] in the footprint
[11:48] of the stranger
[11:51] on Galile.
[11:53] [Music]
[11:56] And the voice
[11:58] that the below
[12:05] will be hurting
[12:07] Judea.
[12:13] But the path
[12:15] of that long
[12:17] Galilee
[12:27] [Music]
[12:37] when I get to the end of the
[12:45] And the
[12:47] road
[12:49] will see nothing
[12:53] when I get to the end of the
[12:59] [Music]
[13:04] hills
[13:05] to climb upward.
[13:09] I am often
[13:12] longing for rest.
[13:17] But he
[13:19] who appoints me my pathway
[13:25] knows just what is
[13:30] best.
[13:33] I know
[13:35] in his word
[13:37] he has promised
[13:41] my strength it will be as my day
[13:49] and the
[13:52] road
[13:53] will see
[13:57] when I get to the end of my way.
[14:03] [Music]
[14:05] Yes.
[14:10] see nothing
[14:13] when I get to the end of the way.
[14:22] He loves me too well to forsake me
[14:30] or give me one trial
[14:34] too much.
[14:37] All his people
[14:40] have been dearly purchased
[14:46] and Satan
[14:48] can never
[14:50] claim such
[14:53] by and by I shall see him and praise him
[15:01] in the city
[15:03] of unending
[15:09] And the
[15:12] road will see
[15:17] when I get to the end of the way.
[15:24] Yes. The toils
[15:27] of the road, they will sing.
[15:33] When I get to the end of the way,
[15:41] when the last earthly step has been
[15:46] taken
[15:49] and the gates of that city
[15:53] appear,
[15:57] and the beautiful
[15:59] songs
[16:01] of the angels
[16:05] flow out on my listening
[16:09] ear.
[16:13] When all that seems so mysterious
[16:20] will be bright and as clear as the day.
[16:28] And the toys
[16:30] of the road will see nothing
[16:36] when we get to the end of the way.
[16:44] Yes, the
[16:47] road they will see nothing
[16:52] when we get to
[16:55] the end of the way.
[17:05] Amen.
[17:06] God bless you, Sister Elizabeth. We
[17:08] appreciate that. Why don't we stand just
[17:11] as we invite our pastor to come bring
[17:14] the word this evening? We'll sing 938 on
[17:17] the screen.
[17:19] Let's sing the chorus. High and lifted
[17:21] up.
[17:22] [Music]
[17:23] High and lifted up in all his glory.
[17:32] High and lifted up in roses of wine.
[17:39] For he's coming back to rule and reign
[17:44] forever.
[17:47] Oh, high and lifted up is Jesus Christ.
[17:55] High lifted up in all his glory.
[18:02] [Music]
[18:03] High lifted up
[18:12] to rule and reign forever.
[18:18] He's high lifted up is Jesus Christ.
[18:26] High lifted up in all his glory. We are
[18:32] his glory tonight. High lied up in the
[18:37] ros of
[18:40] He's coming back to rule and reign
[18:45] forever. Ever
[18:49] highly lifted up is Jesus Christ.
[18:56] Oh, high and lifted up in all his glory.
[19:04] High and lifted up in ros.
[19:11] He's coming back to rule and reign
[19:15] forever.
[19:17] [Music]
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we're here for this
[19:29] evening.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Lift him up.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could sing All That I Am,
[19:35] All That I Have, All That I Can Ever Be.
[19:38] I'd like to just sing this as a prayer
[19:40] before we come to the word this evening.
[19:42] So nice to see you all here. I believe
[19:46] the the Lord is pleased with that.
[19:50] Amen. We have almost almost every day we
[19:54] have testimonies wonderful testimonies
[19:58] be it would be nice if we could share
[20:00] them with you by name but it's not
[20:03] possible because you know the broadcast
[20:06] goes out the service goes out but I
[20:09] received a lovely email from a pastor
[20:12] today in one of the republics of the
[20:15] former Soviet Union and we met we met in
[20:20] Norway for the first time this last
[20:24] spring in July it was I'm sorry
[20:28] and this brother had a very very
[20:32] grave situation. And it had it there was
[20:34] a death in the family
[20:36] and uh in fact as he had lost his wife
[20:40] and I
[20:41] was speaking to him through an
[20:43] interpreter after towards the end of one
[20:46] of the last services.
[20:48] And uh there was another situation that
[20:51] was similar to his
[20:53] that I remembered
[20:57] many years ago, a lot of years ago. And
[20:59] it seemed like it was so impossible. And
[21:02] this this brother
[21:04] years ago just at the at the dinner
[21:07] table before we prayed, he unburdened
[21:10] his heart and uh he said, "Would you
[21:13] pray for me?" And we prayed just a
[21:18] simple prayer over the food and
[21:20] remembered his request.
[21:23] I saw him a year ago,
[21:27] a year ago, Easter, and he told me, he
[21:30] said, "God answered that prayer in three
[21:32] months." And I've been waiting for
[21:35] years, and it was answered in three
[21:37] months. And I told this brother that
[21:40] testimony. And he said in an email today
[21:44] through a translator, he said, "When you
[21:46] told me that testimony, it just stuck in
[21:49] my heart." He says, "And in three
[21:51] months, my prayer was answered."
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, we thank God. Isn't that
[21:57] wonderful? Isn't that wonderful?
[22:00] Hallelujah.
[22:01] Our God's a wonderful God. Amen. And
[22:04] he's conscious of us right here this
[22:07] evening. Amen. All that I am.
[22:12] All that I have.
[22:17] All that I am,
[22:22] all
[22:24] I shall never
[22:27] [Music]
[22:38] [Applause]
[22:41] [Music]
[22:44] surrender
[22:50] Heavenly Fathers, we have sung these
[22:52] words.
[22:54] We believe that you inspired someone
[22:58] to write them, to pen them,
[23:02] to say from their heart, "All that I
[23:05] have and all that I am, I give to you
[23:10] now." I pray father that the service
[23:12] this evening will not be one of words
[23:18] not only reading of the scripture but
[23:20] may the author of the word
[23:23] come and do for us in this service what
[23:26] needs to be done.
[23:29] Lord Jesus be the glorified one. Be the
[23:33] honored one. And before the people leave
[23:36] this sanctuary and those that are
[23:39] streaming, oh God, of the invisible
[23:41] audience, invisible to us, but not
[23:44] invisible to you, I pray that before
[23:46] they lay their head upon a pillow this
[23:48] evening, that there will be something,
[23:50] oh God, that they can lift up their
[23:52] voice and say, "Thanks be to God. I
[23:55] prayed. I asked, and I you heard me, and
[23:58] I know it's done.
[24:00] Bless us together as we read your word.
[24:03] Anoint the people. anoint myself, oh
[24:05] father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[24:10] Amen.
[24:13] Take your Bibles if you would please,
[24:14] and turn to First Kings,
[24:18] book of First Kings,
[24:20] the 18th chapter.
[24:26] And we're going to begin reading at
[24:27] verse 25 to give us a little bit of a
[24:30] background.
[24:39] And Elijah said unto the prophets of
[24:41] Baal, "Choose you one bulock for
[24:45] yourselves, and dress it first, for you
[24:47] are many, and call on the name of your
[24:50] gods, but put no fire under." And they
[24:53] took the bulock which was given them,
[24:54] and they dressed it, and called on the
[24:57] name of Baal from morning, even until
[25:01] noon.
[25:03] saying, "Oh Baal, hear us." But there
[25:05] was no voice, nor any that answered. And
[25:08] they leaped upon the altar which was
[25:10] made. And it came to pass at noon that
[25:12] Elijah mocked them, and said, "Cry
[25:15] aloud, for he is a God, either he is
[25:18] talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in
[25:21] a journey, or pre-adventure, he
[25:22] sleepeth, and must be awake." And they
[25:25] cried aloud and cut themselves after
[25:28] their manner with knives and lancets
[25:30] till the blood gushed out upon them. And
[25:33] it came to pass when midday was passed
[25:36] that they prophesied until the time of
[25:38] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[25:41] that there was neither voice nor any to
[25:44] answer nor any that regarded. And Elijah
[25:47] said unto all the people, "Come near
[25:49] unto me." And all the people came near
[25:52] unto him. And he repaired the altar of
[25:55] the Lord that was broken down. And
[25:57] Elijah took the 12 took 12 stones
[26:00] according to the number of the tribes of
[26:02] the sons of Jacob. Unto whom the word of
[26:04] the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be
[26:08] thy name. And with the stones he built
[26:10] an altar in the name of the Lord.
[26:14] And he made a trench about the altar as
[26:17] great as would contain two measures of
[26:19] seed. And he put the wood in order and
[26:22] cut the bulock in pieces and laid him on
[26:24] the wood and and said, "Fill four
[26:27] barrels with water and pour it on the
[26:29] burnt sacrifice and on the wood." And he
[26:32] said, "Do it the second time." And they
[26:34] did it the second time. And he said, "Do
[26:35] it the third time." And he did it and
[26:37] they did it the third time. And the
[26:40] water ran about around about the altar,
[26:43] and he filled the trench also with
[26:45] water. And it came to pass at the time
[26:48] of the evening of the offering of the
[26:50] evening sacrifice that Elijah the
[26:53] prophet came near and said, Lord God of
[26:55] Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel. Let it be
[26:59] known this day that thou art God in
[27:01] Israel, and that I have that I am thy
[27:04] servant, and that I have done all these
[27:07] things at thy word. Hear me, oh Lord.
[27:11] hear me that this people may know that
[27:14] thou art the Lord God and that thou hast
[27:16] turned their heart back again. And then
[27:19] the fire of the Lord fell and consumed
[27:22] the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the
[27:26] stones and the dust and licked up the
[27:28] water that was in the trench. And when
[27:32] all the people saw it, they fell on
[27:34] their faces and they said, "The Lord, he
[27:38] is the God. The Lord he is the God.
[27:42] Amen. You may be seated.
[27:49] I will not keep you long but I will uh
[27:53] if we don't finish this evening then we
[27:55] will just uh continue on Sunday. I want
[27:58] to uh I want to in incorporate perhaps
[28:01] some of the things from last Sunday the
[28:05] marred sacrifi the marred masterpiece
[28:08] but I want to speak on the altar of your
[28:11] heart uh this evening the altar of your
[28:15] heart uh in the message handwriting on
[28:19] the wall brother Brandham simply said
[28:21] your heart is God's altar
[28:26] in Jehovah Gyrus series he said your
[28:28] heart is the altar just pull back all
[28:32] the unbelief and know that he is here
[28:36] now. So your heart is a altar is the
[28:39] altar. So everyone here I was conscious
[28:43] as I was getting ready for this service
[28:46] in the last few days and I thought I
[28:49] will be speaking to a group of people
[28:51] and one thing will be certain every
[28:54] person that I'm speaking to has an
[28:58] altar.
[29:00] Everyone has an altar. And I must say I
[29:04] also wrestled with the subject a wee bit
[29:07] because sometimes they get so immense
[29:10] and I've mentioned that to you
[29:12] previously. They get so
[29:15] uh you know the subject becomes so large
[29:17] it's hard to define it really clearly
[29:20] and we want to be able to do it. It's a
[29:22] real real challenge to try and get some
[29:24] of these things down into an hour or
[29:26] even two hours as it was on Sunday. So
[29:29] now altars, I I I have to just take you
[29:33] the way that God deals with me. And I
[29:36] always like to see how something
[29:38] originated.
[29:39] You know what? Because I know that if
[29:42] it's in the word, then it had to be in
[29:44] the mind of God.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; And I like to see how it was initiated.
[29:48] How did it start? And we did that when
[29:51] we we went through the anointing. And we
[29:54] went to the very first instance of the
[29:56] anointing and saw how it progressed uh
[29:59] all the way through from having oil
[30:00] poured on a stone that Jacob had his
[30:03] head laid upon until the people in the
[30:06] in the New Testament have the anointing
[30:08] from within something poured out
[30:10] transferred to them. And I don't know uh
[30:13] what it's meant to you but to me those
[30:15] thoughts remain fixed in my mind and in
[30:18] my heart in my soul. It becomes a part
[30:21] of my spiritual life. it part of my
[30:24] spiritual structure and that's what the
[30:26] word is to do. So we want to come here
[30:28] prepared not only not to hear just a
[30:30] message on a Wednesday evening or on a
[30:32] Sunday service but that we receive
[30:34] something in it is permanently lodged in
[30:37] our heart permanently and something that
[30:40] lifts us up something that takes us
[30:42] further something that strengthens us
[30:44] edifies us and makes us more prepared
[30:47] for the oncoming days and the rapture.
[30:50] Amen. And so as I look back into the uh
[30:54] scriptures to see uh where altars were
[30:58] first uh initiated in the scripture uh
[31:02] first quite often as it is in this case
[31:06] there's quite a difference of of the
[31:08] meaning even of the words and quite
[31:10] frankly I believe that God knew that we
[31:13] were going to have a Bible that is as
[31:16] translated from the Hebrew in the Old
[31:19] Testament and from the Greek in the New
[31:21] Testament and then you'll find a Hebrew
[31:23] word and it will have one connotation.
[31:27] It will have a a different flavor, a
[31:29] different and and when you really look
[31:32] at it, you find that that was very
[31:34] specifically ordained of God because
[31:37] that really pertained to the Jewish
[31:40] mind, the Hebrew mind, I will say it was
[31:43] the way they saw things. It they had to
[31:45] see it that way because that was the
[31:47] life that they were living. And then
[31:49] when you come over to the New Testament
[31:51] and the New Testament now you we take
[31:54] and we read the Old Testament we
[31:55] spiritualize everything. And of course
[31:57] the Jewish people today even today and
[32:00] back then they didn't they didn't
[32:03] spiritualize things at all. Everything
[32:05] was what it was. A tree was a tree. A
[32:07] stone was a stone. You know the lineage
[32:09] was the lineage. It wasn't they didn't
[32:11] have a new birth concept. They didn't
[32:13] have uh you know a spiritual lineage.
[32:16] and and God was the great creator and
[32:18] and Elohim and and so on and Jehovah the
[32:22] Lord the Lord God and so they had they
[32:25] just see things from a very very factual
[32:29] standpoint and you'll find in the Hebrew
[32:31] language uh the way it's written in the
[32:33] Bible that often very often that's
[32:36] exactly how the meaning of that word
[32:39] comes and and it it tends towards the
[32:42] way that they believed and the way they
[32:43] saw things and now for example temple
[32:46] the heart in the Hebrew because the
[32:49] altar of your heart. So the heart in the
[32:52] Hebrew
[32:53] had reference to the inner man,
[32:58] the mind, your will, your understanding.
[33:02] I don't want to go over these very
[33:04] quickly because I want you to ponder
[33:05] them. Your mind, your will,
[33:10] your understanding,
[33:12] your knowledge, your thinking,
[33:16] your reflection, what you ponder, things
[33:19] you your memory, things that are in your
[33:22] memory bank,
[33:25] your resolution, when you determine
[33:28] something, you think something over, and
[33:30] then you make a decision, then you
[33:32] resolve. That's the way I'm going to go.
[33:35] That's what I'm going to do. That was
[33:37] all in the Hebrew understanding of your
[33:39] heart.
[33:41] The determination of the will and your
[33:43] conscience.
[33:45] It also referred to the place your heart
[33:50] to the Hebrews was a place of your moral
[33:54] character and the seat of your
[33:56] appetites, the things that you crave
[33:59] from within,
[34:01] the seat of your emotions and your
[34:03] passions
[34:06] and also the place of your courage.
[34:09] If you took all of those and sat and you
[34:12] really need to maybe if you hear this
[34:14] service again you can jot those down
[34:18] because that was now the Hebrew
[34:21] understanding
[34:23] and their concept of what the heart was.
[34:27] Then when you come over to the Greek and
[34:29] you'll find many of the Greek words.
[34:31] This is not a a lesson now because I'm
[34:33] not a teacher as such. But when you come
[34:36] over to the Greek, you find that many of
[34:38] their words, our English words have come
[34:40] from and the heart is cardio where we
[34:43] have cardiac arrest and so on. So that's
[34:46] where our our word comes from. But now
[34:49] to the Greeks, they they have it
[34:52] combined because they also include it as
[34:56] the as the circulatory part of our
[34:59] circulatory system. our heart that pumps
[35:02] our our blood and it's part of that
[35:05] system and hence it is regarded as the
[35:09] seat of physical life as far as the
[35:12] Greeks are concerned and we have the
[35:14] same understanding. We know that our our
[35:16] heart has that aspect but also
[35:20] it is more than the center of the
[35:22] physical but in the Greek it was also
[35:25] the center of the spiritual the
[35:28] spiritual life. It is the seat of uh the
[35:33] actually the seat of your uh uh not only
[35:37] your spiritual life but the the vigor of
[35:39] your spiritual life, the energy of your
[35:41] spiritual life. And now this I want to
[35:44] just read it for you. The center and
[35:47] seat of spiritual life, the soul or
[35:50] mind. We know that the heart is not the
[35:53] soul per se because brother Brennham
[35:56] tells us exactly that the soul there's
[35:59] only one channel to the soul and that
[36:00] soul that channel is you either believe
[36:04] or you disbelieve and that channel but
[36:07] they they they believed it was the seed
[36:10] of spiritual life the soul or the mind
[36:13] and as it is the fountain and seat of
[36:16] thoughts. Now they come to the same line
[36:19] of of the Hebrew, the the thoughts and
[36:22] the passions, the desires, the
[36:24] appetites, the affections,
[36:27] your purposes, your endeavors,
[36:31] the understanding and the faculty and
[36:34] the seat of your intelligence,
[36:37] of the will and your character
[36:41] of the soul so far as it is affected and
[36:44] stirred in a way that is good or a a way
[36:47] that is good or the soul is the seat of
[36:49] its sensibilities,
[36:51] affections, emotions, desires,
[36:53] appetites, and passions. It repeats it
[36:55] again because sometimes the word comes
[36:58] from two two different words. So I said
[37:00] all of that and brother Brandham said
[37:03] and I give you the quote a little later
[37:05] on said that science had recently
[37:08] discovered that there was a place in the
[37:11] heart because the Bible says as a man
[37:14] thinkketh in his heart so is he. Now it
[37:18] isn't just that perhaps you've run into
[37:20] people who uh ridicule that but I did in
[37:25] my short lifetime I I've I've had you
[37:29] know discussion of other people says
[37:30] well the heart a person doesn't think
[37:32] with their heart they think with their
[37:34] head but then uh science had said and
[37:37] brother Brandham made reference to the
[37:39] article to the report that there was a
[37:42] that there was even a place within the
[37:44] heart that they said there was no cells
[37:47] or something. He said that it was it was
[37:49] a a place that they couldn't grasp. They
[37:52] couldn't understand. But the Bible
[37:54] nevertheless, whether they found out or
[37:56] whether science discovered it or whether
[37:58] somebody in Chicago reported it or or
[38:01] who whoever said anything about it, this
[38:04] word says, "As a man thinkketh in his
[38:06] heart, so is he." So there's a region,
[38:09] there's a realm, and and the Hebrews
[38:12] struggle to get a word for it, and the
[38:14] Greeks struggle to get a word for it,
[38:16] and we struggle to understand it, to
[38:18] comprehend it. But we don't have to
[38:20] struggle. All we have to do is just
[38:22] simply take it. As a man thinkketh in
[38:24] his heart, so is he. Then a prophet says
[38:27] that your heart is God's altar.
[38:33] the first altar that was ever
[38:35] constructed.
[38:37] And I always think as I said when I go
[38:39] back and see where the initial
[38:43] event took place, I ask and we need to
[38:46] ask
[38:48] as it was in this case and Noah builded
[38:50] an altar. He just came out of the ark
[38:53] into the new world as it were and he
[38:56] builded an altar unto the Lord and he
[39:00] took every clean beast and every clean
[39:04] fowl and offered burnt offerings. You
[39:07] know, I would say that Noah expressed in
[39:12] this act a great deal of confidence that
[39:16] those animals, remember, he only had
[39:20] seven of the clean.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; And he's only coming out with a handful
[39:25] of creatures into the whole earth. And
[39:28] the first thing he does is offer some as
[39:30] a sacrifice to God. But he built an
[39:33] altar. He built an altar.
[39:36] whatever came over him to build an
[39:38] altar. Where did he get the idea? Where
[39:41] did it ever come from? I'm going to
[39:43] build an altar and I'm going to burn
[39:45] something on this altar and I'm going to
[39:48] offer it to God who just destroyed the
[39:50] world.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; I don't expect you to understand that.
[39:56] But the next verse said, "And the Lord
[39:59] smelled the sweet savor. And the Lord
[40:03] said in his heart, I will not again
[40:06] curse the ground anymore for man's sake.
[40:10] For the imagination of man's heart is
[40:13] evil from his youth. Neither will I
[40:16] again smite anymore every living thing
[40:20] as I have done. Here's a man, one of
[40:23] eight souls left on the earth. Got seven
[40:27] of each clean animal, only two of the
[40:29] unclean. and he comes out into this
[40:32] newly renovated earth as it were and he
[40:36] takes those animals and he builds an
[40:38] altar,
[40:40] takes and sacrifices some animals and
[40:43] God, the Bible says God smelled that
[40:46] sacrifice
[40:48] and it was pleasant to him and God said,
[40:52] I tell you friends, man to think that
[40:54] this great creator of heavens and earth
[40:57] could allow a person to do a simple act
[41:01] and that God would focus all of his
[41:03] attention on that on that simple thing
[41:06] that's happening. He might be doing that
[41:08] right now
[41:10] &gt;&gt; as simple as you driving to service
[41:11] tonight. What was the purpose that you
[41:13] came and what was your desire? What why
[41:17] are you here? God sees all of that. And
[41:20] I believe I trust believe with all my
[41:22] heart that something is pleasant to him.
[41:25] That something is a sweet smelling
[41:27] incense to him. If we believe it's
[41:30] beyond us, it'll never happen. But when
[41:32] Noah came out, he didn't he didn't just
[41:34] say, "I'm going to do this and I hope
[41:36] the smoke ascends and I hope it I hope I
[41:39] hope I hope it does something." He he
[41:41] built that altar unto the Lord.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; This is to you. I'm doing this for you.
[41:48] I'm doing it unto the Lord and I'm going
[41:50] to make a sacrifice here unto him. And
[41:53] the Bible says, "While the earth
[41:56] remainth," God speaking, "Seed time and
[41:58] harvest, and cold and heat, and summer
[42:01] and winter, and day and night shall not
[42:04] cease." God said that
[42:08] when when Noah had made his sacrifice.
[42:11] So now the initial and this is where
[42:16] our first thought comes from the initial
[42:20] the initial concept or the initial act
[42:24] of building an altar and making a
[42:27] sacrifice that gave the name to the
[42:30] altar. It was the place of slaughter.
[42:34] Slaughter of course is death and the
[42:37] place of sacrifice.
[42:39] That's what it is. An altar is a place
[42:42] of sacrifice. The Hebrews understood it
[42:44] as a place where something dies.
[42:48] And you got an altar.
[42:52] And there may be some things even
[42:55] tonight in your heart that really needs
[42:59] to die.
[43:02] And there may be some other things that
[43:04] need to be offered to God.
[43:07] Say, I hold that. I've held that on my
[43:10] heart. It's been such a treasure and
[43:11] I've just held that on my heart.
[43:13] Sometimes there's a there can be a an
[43:16] adversity, a way to I'm going to not get
[43:19] get ahead of myself. Sometimes there can
[43:21] be some disappointment and we hold it
[43:23] some bitterness and we hold it some
[43:25] this, some that, some hurt, something
[43:27] else. And you need to let that thing die
[43:32] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[43:34] I don't want to just preach. I want God
[43:36] by the Holy Spirit to come into this
[43:38] congregation and do it.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Just the same as if you were sick, I'd
[43:43] want to see you healed. I pray that you
[43:45] will be healed. I'll say the same thing
[43:47] the prophet said. If I was God, I'd heal
[43:49] you. If I was God, I would light the
[43:52] fire to the sacrifice tonight and set
[43:55] you free and let you walk out of these
[43:57] doors a transformed person.
[44:01] And there isn't a person. I don't think
[44:03] there's a person in here including
[44:04] myself. I just I'm we're brothers and
[44:07] sisters together. But what there is
[44:09] something I I I tried to ponder tried to
[44:12] meditate how we could how I could be
[44:15] concise enough about our heart and
[44:17] describe our heart and what is on our
[44:19] heart and and I found myself floundering
[44:22] but I'll do my best to move through
[44:25] that. But now at least I have you in the
[44:27] channel in the channel of my thoughts.
[44:29] So it is initially it's a place of
[44:31] slaughter and a place of sacrifice
[44:35] for the believer. A place of sacrifice I
[44:38] believe is more appropriate for us as
[44:40] believers
[44:42] because the slaying of an animal is most
[44:47] often an offering to God. Abraham built
[44:51] an altar unto the Lord upon receiving a
[44:54] promise. I think this is the second
[44:55] occurrence, the second time it is
[44:57] mentioned. And the Bible says in Genesis
[45:00] 12:7 it says, "And the Lord appeared
[45:02] unto him." Now the Lord is initiating
[45:05] this. The Lord appeared unto him, unto
[45:07] Abram, and said unto thy seed will I
[45:10] give this land, and there builded he an
[45:13] altar unto the Lord who appeared unto
[45:15] him. Now he builded an altar because now
[45:18] he's been given a promise. Something
[45:20] just how how did that promise come? How
[45:22] was that voice to him? I don't know.
[45:24] That's really irrelevant. But it's how
[45:26] how he received it. And that altar was
[45:29] evidence of his faith that I have heard
[45:31] from God. He didn't build the altar
[45:34] because he imagined something.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't build an altar because he
[45:37] thought he thought of something or he
[45:40] conjured something out of his mind. He
[45:41] built an altar because he said, "God
[45:44] appeared to me and I'm going to build
[45:46] something physical here on earth to
[45:48] testify that God spoke to me. God gave
[45:51] me a promise." And furthermore, even a
[45:54] man has no children says, "This land
[45:56] belongs to me and to my seed, God came.
[46:00] God told me, and I'm going to make a
[46:02] sacrifice right here. I'm going to build
[46:04] an altar and worship God right here that
[46:06] appeared to him."
[46:10] Building an altar, an offering
[46:15] is we offer something of value. You
[46:18] don't put something on this altar. I'm
[46:21] talking about altar of your heart and
[46:23] say like people at Lent, Brother Bam
[46:25] talks about Lent. Different churches
[46:28] keep Lent. And so for Lent, they say,
[46:30] "Well, you know, people who smoke, I
[46:33] won't smoke during Lent." Oh, big deal.
[46:36] You know, I won't, you know, I won't eat
[46:39] my desserts during Lent. I'm going to
[46:41] sacrifice.
[46:45] I don't think I don't think that
[46:47] sacrifice got the 30 foot up to the
[46:49] ceiling quite frankly. You know, you
[46:52] might say, well, the people are sincere.
[46:53] It's not not a matter of sincerity. It's
[46:55] a matter of what what initiated what
[46:58] caused that sacrifice. I I really
[47:01] believe you might say, "Well, brother,
[47:03] brother Ed, you said already tonight
[47:04] that we could, you know, perhaps this
[47:06] evening that God would it depends on
[47:09] just how sincere, not only how sincere,
[47:13] but if we do it as a result of the
[47:16] ministry of the word, then you can say,
[47:19] "God spoke to me.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; God spoke to me. He initiated this."
[47:25] Brother, brother Ed doesn't know what's
[47:27] in my heart, but God spoke to him. God
[47:31] caused him to read a certain scripture,
[47:34] to say a certain phrase. And I don't
[47:36] receive it from a man just at the
[47:38] pulpit. I receive it from God.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Can you do that?
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:47] So, we offer something that is of of
[47:50] value.
[47:53] And so I might say because I wanted to
[47:56] ask a question this evening. We have an
[47:58] altar. I think
[48:02] you accept that.
[48:04] I'd like to just ask what is on your
[48:07] altar?
[48:10] What do we have on our heart? And I'm
[48:13] sure that uh you're probably going to go
[48:15] through the same exercise that I went
[48:17] through. And I hope that you'll go home
[48:20] with it. say, "Yeah, what is what is on
[48:23] my heart?"
[48:26] How do you define it? Is it something
[48:28] I'm thinking about or is it is it
[48:30] something I feel or is it what what is
[48:32] it that's on my heart really? What is
[48:35] it? Well, if I can help you a wee bit, I
[48:39] would say something that's on your heart
[48:41] is is something that's
[48:44] persistently and almost constantly
[48:47] there. It is something that is there
[48:51] It is something that you don't have to
[48:54] uh try to bring it there. You know, if
[48:58] if you've been hurt, let's let me just
[49:00] take the negative side. Let's say that a
[49:02] person's been really hurt, really
[49:04] disappointed, really wounded. Something
[49:07] very very unhappy came your way and you
[49:11] are hurt. You're very hurt. You're so
[49:14] hurt you don't want to really talk to
[49:16] anybody about it. You're so hurt, you
[49:18] don't want to you don't want to go over
[49:19] and visit. You don't want to fellowship.
[49:21] You don't want to really talk to
[49:22] anybody. You just kind of you're you're
[49:25] real hurt. You're wounded. You're hurt.
[49:28] Now, you don't have to think about that.
[49:31] You don't have to think that you're
[49:32] hurt. You don't have to try to, you
[49:36] know,
[49:38] you don't have to try to make it up.
[49:40] It's just there. And it's there when
[49:42] you're eating your breakfast. And it's
[49:44] there when you're in your car. And it's
[49:46] there when you lay your head upon the
[49:48] pillow at night. And maybe when you wake
[49:50] up in the middle of the night, it's
[49:51] there. And maybe you can't sleep because
[49:53] it's there. That's on your heart.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; That's something that's on your heart.
[49:58] That's what I'm talking about. Maybe God
[50:00] starts dealing with a person. I'll come
[50:02] in a positive way. God starts dealing
[50:04] with a person and you're in a service
[50:07] and something is said, something
[50:09] happens. A song is sung. You just feel a
[50:12] different presence around you and you go
[50:14] out. you got to go to work and that is
[50:16] there. It's just there and it's there
[50:18] when you're eating your dinner and it's
[50:20] there it's there when you're visiting
[50:22] and you can be in a room full of people
[50:24] but you're you're kind of in a place by
[50:26] yourself. You're in a you're in a place
[50:29] that's that's you're shut away inwardly.
[50:32] You're shut away. I'd say that God is
[50:35] dealing with your heart that's on your
[50:38] heart.
[50:47] last Sunday
[50:50] uh I was speaking and and I'll just
[50:53] bring your memory back
[50:56] and uh we talked uh talked about
[51:01] how Israel had gone into such a decline
[51:05] and they were offering
[51:07] they became idolattors
[51:10] and Gerobam who was the son of Solomon's
[51:13] servant and Riaboam was Solomon's son
[51:17] and uh prophet Aia came and tore a new
[51:22] garment his new garment and gave 10
[51:24] pieces to Jeroboam and says you're going
[51:27] to have 10 tribes and God is dividing
[51:30] he's rending the kingdom from David but
[51:32] nevertheless for David's sake he's going
[51:34] to leave one tribe to Riaboam and
[51:38] Jerusalem and he will be in Jerusalem
[51:41] and have Riaboam and Riabom rather will
[51:44] have Jerusalem and Judah as as one tribe
[51:47] and then uh and I'm just going over this
[51:49] briefly going to spend about one two
[51:51] minutes on it only and Gerobam
[51:54] and he said it's going to be too too
[51:56] troublesome and if the people go there
[51:57] and worship in Jerusalem they their
[51:59] hearts might be won back to Riabom and
[52:02] then their allegiance will be won over
[52:04] so I will make it I'll make it
[52:06] comfortable for them so I'll have a
[52:07] golden calf in in Bethl and one in Dan
[52:10] man and just tell the people here these
[52:12] are your gods you worship here. And so
[52:15] uh as time went on
[52:18] uh Jerobom himself is standing at the
[52:21] altar
[52:23] of sacrifice.
[52:25] So they never got away from the
[52:27] religious acts. They kept their
[52:29] religious acts up. They've got an altar.
[52:31] They're burning sacrifices and so on.
[52:33] They're going through all of the
[52:34] motions. And incidentally, that fits
[52:37] perfectly to denomination. That is
[52:40] denominationalism. Denominationalism is
[52:42] idolatry because it's left off the
[52:44] headship of God. And so, he's got he
[52:47] he's standing right there by the altar
[52:49] when Aaya comes by and Aaya prophesies
[52:53] and he cries out and he prophesies
[52:56] against the altar. against the altar
[53:00] and and uh I I won't bother going into
[53:03] it because I don't want to take the time
[53:05] with it. But oh altar, oh altar, aas
[53:08] sang and he prophesies against it. He
[53:11] says because on you the bones of the
[53:13] prophets who who offered these
[53:15] sacrifices are going to the bones are
[53:17] going to be burnt on you. And Jeroboam
[53:20] stretches out his hand like that and it
[53:23] it it freezes it. It it it becomes stone
[53:26] dead. And then he calls on Jerobom to
[53:30] calls on I'm sorry on Aia to pray and
[53:33] his hand is restored to normal again.
[53:35] But now Israel had sunk to such a
[53:39] degraded place that they were uh they
[53:43] were offering on those altars uh
[53:48] idolatrous sacrifices. But the strange
[53:51] thing is that uh the prophet had spoken
[53:54] to Aaya. I mean the prophet Acha had
[53:58] spoken to to Jeroboam and told him told
[54:02] him that the reason why God was rending
[54:05] the kingdom was because they had gone
[54:07] into such idolatry and were worshiping
[54:10] all these various gods and he named them
[54:12] all off. And then Jerobom goes right
[54:14] back and falls right back into it. A
[54:17] prophet comes in this generation and he
[54:19] says he says to the people he says to
[54:22] Pentecost he goes back and he says here
[54:25] Luther came out of that harlot church
[54:29] and have a great move of God and the
[54:32] people don't stay with the move of God
[54:34] they go right back into that
[54:36] denominational
[54:38] idolatry and then Wesley comes out and
[54:41] there's a great move of God and the
[54:43] people go right back into it and
[54:46] Pentecost come right out and that's
[54:48] where he cried out because he was a
[54:50] messenger to that church age and he said
[54:52] your fathers came to this land to run
[54:57] away from that thing and you've run
[54:58] right back into it and if you want to
[55:01] read Frank Bartleman who was a
[55:03] journalist whose picture is with with
[55:05] Daddy Seymour in the Isuza Street book
[55:07] if you read Isuza Street
[55:10] and and and uh John G Lake is there
[55:15] brother FF F. Bosworth is there. Uh,
[55:18] Daddy Seymour is there in that picture.
[55:21] And some of the first fathers of
[55:22] Pentecost are there. And here Bosworth
[55:26] traveling with brother Brandham and
[55:27] declaring to the people, God has raised
[55:30] up unto us a prophet. And he stayed with
[55:33] that message right to his dying days up
[55:36] way up in his senior 80 in his 80s when
[55:39] he passed away. Brother Brandham told me
[55:41] when he heard that brother Bosworth was
[55:42] passing away, he he went and went down
[55:46] to Florida as fast as he could and came
[55:48] to his bedside and he said, "I went and
[55:51] threw myself on him and and he said, "Oh
[55:54] my God, my God, the horses of and the
[55:56] chariots and the horses thereof, you
[55:59] know, the same thing that was said, I
[56:01] believe, by Elisha when Elijah was
[56:04] taken." and uh and here these here these
[56:08] men are but he's crying out says you
[56:10] came out of that your fathers came out
[56:13] of it and now you're taking it right
[56:15] back in. What was he doing? He was
[56:16] crying against the idolatry that was
[56:19] coming back and they were trying to make
[56:21] a you know to make everything a system
[56:25] everything to make it a system a
[56:26] denominational system. So uh
[56:32] and so Jesus made reference to Jesus
[56:35] made reference to uh
[56:38] Solomon
[56:40] and he said and yet I say unto you
[56:43] speaking to the people at that time. Now
[56:45] here's Jesus speaking that even Solomon
[56:48] in all his glory was not a raid like one
[56:52] of these speaking of the liies of the
[56:54] field. Solomon in all of his glory. I
[56:57] just want I'm not talking about the
[56:58] liies now. I'm talking about Solomon.
[57:00] Jesus of all of the people that he could
[57:02] have spoken of said Solomon in all of
[57:06] his glory. I just want you to think of
[57:08] that for a moment. And brother Brandham
[57:10] refers to Solomon's age and he refers to
[57:13] the glory of Solomon's age. The reason
[57:15] why I'm saying that is because I'm
[57:17] referring to the altar. how they could
[57:19] go from the glory of Solomon, from the
[57:22] glory of the temple, and sink down to
[57:25] idolatry. You know, people think, "Oh,
[57:27] I'd never do that." You know, we're
[57:29] right in the middle of this great move
[57:30] of God and all the rest of it, but a
[57:32] person has to have a real Holy Ghost
[57:35] guard upon their heart, upon their
[57:38] altar.
[57:40] He says, "And Solomon's age was the
[57:42] millennium for the Jews. It was the
[57:45] golden age for the Jewish people."
[57:48] Solomon was a four type of Christ in
[57:51] that he built the temple and so forth.
[57:54] And then in the message greater than
[57:56] Solomon he said now we find out he comes
[57:59] down then after speaking of Jonah and he
[58:02] comes to Solomon's age. And now we all
[58:05] know that Solomon's age was a
[58:07] millennium. A millennium almost of the
[58:10] Old Testament. It was the greatest time
[58:13] of all Israel ever had was under the
[58:17] reign of Solomon. No wars to speak of.
[58:20] And they had a great time. God gave
[58:23] Solomon which was the son of David. Says
[58:25] gave him a gift. I want you to hold this
[58:28] and watch it very closely. Gave him a
[58:30] gift of discernment. And now he could
[58:32] discern the thoughts in the people's
[58:37] heart.
[58:40] Now he wasn't a prophet. He was a king.
[58:44] Now I want you just take a quantum leap.
[58:48] I think you are thinking. I want you I'm
[58:51] just going slowly purposefully.
[58:55] The scripture that brother Brandham used
[58:59] because he was a prophet. He was not a
[59:02] gift of discernment. In fact is so many
[59:04] of the people even men that I know and
[59:07] I've heard them say it as a gift of
[59:09] discernment. And that's where they went
[59:11] off track because they said, "Oh, you
[59:14] know, because of his gift of discernment
[59:17] and because of the gift of healing,
[59:19] brother Brandham had a great ministry."
[59:20] There's none greater than that. All
[59:22] these others kind of came out from it.
[59:24] But when he went to teaching the word,
[59:26] when he went to teaching, he went off.
[59:28] And that's a little favorite phrase. He
[59:30] went off at the end. Isn't that amazing?
[59:33] of the last of his last 30 services, I
[59:36] think the last 30 services, 28 of them
[59:40] were preached for the Pentecostal
[59:41] people.
[59:43] And I say to them when I'm talking to
[59:44] them, is that right? Ain't that amazing?
[59:47] You people had somebody who was off
[59:49] preaching for you.
[59:51] Isn't that incredible? Is that all the
[59:53] discernment you had?
[59:56] You had somebody who was way off, all
[59:58] false, preaching for you the last 28 of
[1:00:01] his last 30 services. Ah, a big excuse.
[1:00:06] Just a nice little phrase that they try
[1:00:07] to get away from because it wasn't a
[1:00:09] gift of discernment at all. It was
[1:00:11] actually the word coming right out of a
[1:00:12] prophet's mouth. And because the
[1:00:15] scripture says, and he always went back
[1:00:16] to the scripture for the word of God,
[1:00:18] the word of God, the word of God, not
[1:00:21] the gift of discernment, not the gift of
[1:00:23] wisdom or the gift of knowledge. The
[1:00:24] word of God is is is quicker is more
[1:00:28] powerful than a two-edged sword. It's
[1:00:30] quicker. It's a two-edged sword. And
[1:00:33] it's a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:00:34] intents of the heart. It's the word
[1:00:37] that's a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:00:39] intents of the heart. And that is why a
[1:00:41] gift of discernment, you can't stand in
[1:00:42] front of the people, line them all up,
[1:00:44] and use a gift of discernment one after
[1:00:45] the other, one after the other, or call
[1:00:46] them all out. That's not a gift of
[1:00:48] discernment.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; That's a prophetic ministry. And so now
[1:00:52] Jesus is saying a greater he talks about
[1:00:56] uh Solomon having a gift of discernment
[1:00:59] but even after that gift of discernment
[1:01:01] had been there and the queen of Sheba
[1:01:03] comes and here's uh everything is is
[1:01:06] told to her but after Solomon's death
[1:01:09] not long after his death the nation of
[1:01:12] Israel now is divided as I spoke to a
[1:01:14] moment ago it's tore in two 10 tribes go
[1:01:17] one way one goes to uh uh the tribe of
[1:01:21] Judah goes to Riabom and Jerobom takes
[1:01:23] the whole nation into idolatry.
[1:01:27] And when Akea spoken, he said be he,
[1:01:30] this is what he said, because they have
[1:01:33] forsaken me. That was the first thing.
[1:01:36] Because they have forsaken me and have
[1:01:38] worshiped Ashroth, the goddess of the
[1:01:40] Zidians, and Shemosh, the god of the
[1:01:42] Moabites, and Milcom, this the god of
[1:01:45] the am the god of Ammon, and have not
[1:01:48] walked in his ways. That is why God did
[1:01:51] what he did. And then notice now I've
[1:01:54] just I took the Bible. It says within a
[1:01:57] a very few years, approximately nine
[1:02:01] years,
[1:02:03] Jerobom had 10 tribes. He had the 10
[1:02:06] tribes for a for approximately nine
[1:02:09] years. And within that nine years from
[1:02:12] the time of being given 10 glorious
[1:02:15] tribes
[1:02:17] out of this nation, he takes them into
[1:02:20] such steeped idolatry
[1:02:33] in the message. God who is rich in
[1:02:36] mercy.
[1:02:40] Brother Brandham says this.
[1:02:43] He said, 'Look how they did. Now they
[1:02:46] got denominational wild. He said,
[1:02:49] running out to make them each a creed
[1:02:51] and so forth. They just come, they just
[1:02:55] become another idol like a brass
[1:02:58] serpent. And I made reference that the
[1:03:00] brass serpent which at one time gave
[1:03:04] life to them and then they made an idol
[1:03:06] out of the brass serpent and it had to
[1:03:09] be destroyed. It became he makes
[1:03:12] reference to it. It became an idolatry.
[1:03:15] every fellow said.
[1:03:18] Now
[1:03:24] I take this very very seriously and I
[1:03:27] don't want to point a finger elsewhere
[1:03:30] but I'll come right into the land of the
[1:03:33] message itself. He said it became an
[1:03:35] idolatry. Every fellow said
[1:03:40] I belong to this and I belong to that.
[1:03:45] And when I hear that in the message,
[1:03:48] well, I'm following him. No, I'm
[1:03:50] following him. No, we believe this way.
[1:03:52] No, we believe that way. We don't need
[1:03:55] to point a finger anywhere but right
[1:03:57] here at home.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; When we start, you know, constructing uh
[1:04:02] uh even within the message, and that's
[1:04:03] why I say to believers here, don't don't
[1:04:06] ever become a part of that.
[1:04:08] If God takes me off the scene, protect
[1:04:11] your altar against that kind of thing
[1:04:14] that you hold in your altar. Oh, I'm
[1:04:16] after this brother. No, I'm following
[1:04:18] this brother or I'm following this. I'm
[1:04:20] following that. We ought to follow one
[1:04:22] who is the word and the word alone and
[1:04:24] that's none other than the Lord Jesus
[1:04:26] Christ. I tell you, I get into I get
[1:04:28] into cities and I go and have a meeting
[1:04:30] or go into a place, go into a state and
[1:04:33] have a meeting and the first meeting
[1:04:35] generally is just marvelous and all the
[1:04:37] people are there. Then maybe the second
[1:04:39] time or the third time then I find out,
[1:04:41] you know, oh well uh you know we'd like
[1:04:44] to come but uh we we you know and and
[1:04:47] they don't see it just eye to eye. Who
[1:04:49] says we got to see eye to eye?
[1:04:54] I had the brothers in Cape Town, Cape
[1:04:57] Town, South Africa.
[1:05:00] You might think that uh uh
[1:05:04] I don't know what would be a compliment
[1:05:05] to you, but a compliment to me is this
[1:05:07] and it just made me feel so wonderful.
[1:05:11] They said, "Brother Biscll, we have
[1:05:13] about eight different
[1:05:15] churches and groups
[1:05:19] of the message in this area. might have
[1:05:22] been after this kind of doctrine, one
[1:05:24] out of that. And people are sincere.
[1:05:26] They're sincere. They really believe
[1:05:27] they got something. They they're excited
[1:05:29] about it. They're enthused about it and
[1:05:31] all the rest of it. But to me, all the
[1:05:32] enthusiasm and all the incitement and
[1:05:35] all the revelation and whatever else
[1:05:36] that person claims to have, if they got
[1:05:39] to divide and be separate and said, you
[1:05:41] know, we have nothing to do with you,
[1:05:43] then I think all the revelation is very
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; is worthless.
[1:05:47] They said when when you come
[1:05:51] every every time you come to Cape Town,
[1:05:55] South Africa, every group gathers.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; To me, I'm just sharing with you. To me,
[1:06:03] that was one of the greatest compliments
[1:06:05] I've ever been handed in South Africa.
[1:06:08] Every time you come, all the groups
[1:06:09] gather and I'm really happy over that.
[1:06:12] I'm really thankful about that. And now
[1:06:14] of course if someone wants to just go
[1:06:16] with listen if someone goes in all kinds
[1:06:19] of false doctrine so on we don't have to
[1:06:21] follow it we don't have to you just just
[1:06:24] stay right with the word if others
[1:06:25] separate from you that's up to them but
[1:06:28] I mean the thing is for us you know
[1:06:30] protect our altar
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; I hope you got that
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; then he goes on in God who is rich in
[1:06:43] mercy. Again, he said that's just the
[1:06:45] same thing I think that's happened to
[1:06:47] our church ages. God has sent us the
[1:06:50] message of Martin Luther. That's what I
[1:06:52] referred to a moment ago. God has sent
[1:06:55] us the message of Martin Luther with his
[1:06:58] message, John Wesley and the and the
[1:07:00] Pentecostal message. But what did we do
[1:07:03] with it? The very same thing that they
[1:07:06] did with that brass serpent. We idolized
[1:07:09] it. I belong to this and I belong to
[1:07:12] that. Notice he says exactly the same
[1:07:14] words. I belong to this and I belong to
[1:07:17] that. I think it's sufficient. He says
[1:07:20] what we need on the scene today is a
[1:07:23] prophet that will destroy the idol of
[1:07:26] denominations.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Now he said this also and I know that
[1:07:32] perhaps you're thinking of it. When the
[1:07:34] third pull ministry came,
[1:07:37] he said they'll never denominate this
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; because you cannot denominate Christ.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; You cannot denominate maybe every
[1:07:48] denomination in the world maybe holds
[1:07:50] this Bible, but you cannot denominate
[1:07:53] this word.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; You can't denominate it. You can maybe
[1:07:57] interpret it this way or interpret it
[1:07:58] that way or or lean whichever direction
[1:08:01] a person wants to lean. You may say well
[1:08:04] you know why am I going into this
[1:08:06] because I think I think it's very
[1:08:08] essential
[1:08:09] but the prophet said you cannot
[1:08:11] denominate
[1:08:13] the third pull the opening of the word
[1:08:15] the message it cannot be denominated
[1:08:21] and quite frankly when the message came
[1:08:26] uh I I wouldn't even hazard a guess here
[1:08:29] of how many denominations are
[1:08:31] represented right here in this little
[1:08:34] group of people. How many denominations?
[1:08:37] Because the message, the messenger, the
[1:08:40] message and Christ who is Christ the
[1:08:43] word destroyed what had been idolized
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; and we held it in our heart and you you
[1:08:50] you can say now that was the thing we
[1:08:52] held it in our heart. We had a certain
[1:08:54] belief, a certain belief and now we had
[1:08:57] that belief on our heart and we held
[1:08:59] that and only the message only the word
[1:09:02] of God can destroy that and cut that
[1:09:05] down and take that brass serpent
[1:09:08] whatever it was something that was it
[1:09:10] was something that was genuine. It was
[1:09:12] something that was good. God did use it
[1:09:14] at one time but then the people idolized
[1:09:17] the thing. had became an idol in that
[1:09:19] they denominated on it and that was on
[1:09:21] the altar of their heart and God had to
[1:09:23] destroy it.
[1:09:29] Now
[1:09:31] in the midst the reason I read uh the
[1:09:34] reason I read uh first kings and about
[1:09:37] Elijah today because this happens to be
[1:09:39] also in the midst of Israel's decline
[1:09:43] and it came to one of their lowest spots
[1:09:46] because Ahab was probably their most
[1:09:49] wicked king
[1:09:52] married Jezebel
[1:09:54] and brought the brought brought the
[1:09:57] nation of Israel down very very low and
[1:10:01] we have received this is not figurative
[1:10:04] speech now but we have received and I
[1:10:07] know that you agree
[1:10:10] uh the same spirit of Elijah not Elijah
[1:10:14] the Tishbite and to you young people
[1:10:16] that are here it's not just brother Ed
[1:10:18] up here speaking on this Wednesday
[1:10:21] evening but the same the same spirit the
[1:10:25] very same spirit spirit. And when I say
[1:10:27] the same spirit, I would expect if it
[1:10:30] was the same spirit that came and
[1:10:32] delivered something to you and I today
[1:10:34] that there would be some resemblance,
[1:10:37] there would be some similarities. And
[1:10:40] there is. And I want you to get those.
[1:10:43] in the midst of such a decline.
[1:10:46] And quite frankly, I must think that
[1:10:48] Leodysia
[1:10:50] is much worse than Israel was when Ahab
[1:10:54] came on the scene. I think that Leodysia
[1:10:58] is much worse because Jesus referred to
[1:11:01] this time
[1:11:02] and he said that it'll be so deceptive
[1:11:06] that even the elect would be deceived if
[1:11:09] it were possible. if it were possible.
[1:11:12] You know, that's a very fine line. A
[1:11:15] very fine line. And if you and I,
[1:11:19] you have the assurance in your heart
[1:11:22] that you've been delivered from this
[1:11:25] desperately,
[1:11:27] desperately deceived age. You have
[1:11:30] something to be very, very thankful of
[1:11:33] tonight.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Very thankful. But in the midst of this
[1:11:38] terrible condition that he was in, and I
[1:11:40] want to say we're in a worse condition,
[1:11:43] this is what happened. And we read the
[1:11:45] scripture.
[1:11:47] The first thing, and I'm I'm looking at
[1:11:51] the 29th verse. Now,
[1:11:58] 30th verse, I'm sorry.
[1:12:01] And Elijah said unto all the people,
[1:12:04] "Come near unto me." And all the people
[1:12:07] came near unto him.
[1:12:10] And he repaired the altar of the Lord
[1:12:12] that was broken down.
[1:12:15] Now,
[1:12:17] I could preach, but I don't want to
[1:12:19] preach. I just want to I want to I want
[1:12:21] you to keep your attention, and I just
[1:12:23] want to keep your uh uh keep talking to
[1:12:26] you like this for this evening.
[1:12:30] I do not believe that Elijah was able
[1:12:34] one man's voice to say to all those
[1:12:37] thousands and thousands of people and
[1:12:39] that they would hear him come near unto
[1:12:41] me.
[1:12:43] I don't believe they heard that. I don't
[1:12:45] believe they said now when Elijah's
[1:12:48] spirit came back today. I happened to go
[1:12:51] to a meeting.
[1:12:54] My father always would come to spiritual
[1:12:57] meetings when everything spiritual was
[1:12:58] coming on. I'd gone to church since I
[1:13:01] was a little fellow. So now I come to
[1:13:03] church and it's in a it's in a a big
[1:13:06] arena. So we we go to the arena, but
[1:13:10] we're going in the afternoon. The
[1:13:11] meeting's not till 7:00. We're going in
[1:13:13] the afternoon. My parents know something
[1:13:16] that I don't know. And we come to the
[1:13:18] arena. I remember like it was yesterday.
[1:13:20] And here's a people lined up, three,
[1:13:23] four, maybe five, six, wide, stringing
[1:13:25] down like this. I thought, what kind of
[1:13:28] service? What kind of what kind of
[1:13:30] meeting is this? Who's this? Who's here?
[1:13:35] Do you know what it was? It was the same
[1:13:38] spirit
[1:13:39] saying to the people, "Come near
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; unto me."
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; And caused the people to come. There was
[1:13:47] it wasn't his charisma
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; even in fact it would be humility
[1:13:54] but there was just something there was a
[1:13:57] presence there was something unusual
[1:13:59] there was a uh you know
[1:14:03] words that you hadn't heard phrases that
[1:14:05] you hadn't heard the angel the angel is
[1:14:08] here or I won't I can't do anything till
[1:14:11] he's here and then to say he's here now
[1:14:14] all these things may seem elementary to
[1:14:16] you. But I want you to see them back in
[1:14:18] the scripture. It was God saying through
[1:14:22] the messenger, "Come near." And the
[1:14:25] people came near. The Bible says, and
[1:14:28] the Bible says now that he
[1:14:32] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[1:14:34] broken down. First it was broken down
[1:14:38] and then he repaired the altar. And this
[1:14:41] this word repaired is
[1:14:46] actually to be healed.
[1:14:49] He healed the altar.
[1:14:53] It has reference to individual
[1:14:55] distresses
[1:14:57] of personal distress or it is simply to
[1:15:00] make healthy which was not well.
[1:15:05] Now, we wouldn't know this outside of
[1:15:07] the message,
[1:15:09] but the altar,
[1:15:12] your heart, which is the altar of God,
[1:15:17] it was not even capable of offering
[1:15:20] anything to God that God would answer
[1:15:24] until the same messenger,
[1:15:27] until the very messenger of the message
[1:15:31] built the altar, rebuilt it, healed
[1:15:36] the heart.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; It's not I'm not talking about little
[1:15:39] hurts and things like that, but these
[1:15:42] altars you you didn't even have
[1:15:44] anything. I want to make that as an
[1:15:46] announcement to you. We all sit here as
[1:15:48] individuals and maybe we came from many,
[1:15:50] many, many different places and many
[1:15:52] different beliefs. But the truth of the
[1:15:54] matter is we didn't even have a
[1:15:56] structure on which to present anything
[1:15:59] to God outside of the messenger first
[1:16:04] repairing healing rafa the altar.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; It had to be healed.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; And that's the first thing he did.
[1:16:13] People think, "Oh, Elijah went on Mount
[1:16:15] Carmel and called fire down from
[1:16:17] heaven." No. Elijah went on Mount Carmel
[1:16:19] and the first thing he repaired the
[1:16:21] altar.
[1:16:22] Called the people to come near him and
[1:16:24] he repaired the he repaired the altar.
[1:16:28] The scripture says who can know the
[1:16:30] heart? Who can know the heart?
[1:16:33] Who can really understand? Do we even
[1:16:35] understand our own heart?
[1:16:38] Who can really know it?
[1:16:41] I got thinking I'd like to speak on the
[1:16:43] subject the secrets of the altar. He
[1:16:46] revealed the secrets of the heart.
[1:16:49] You know, friends,
[1:16:51] we could come to church and we can try
[1:16:54] to generate things. We can try to work
[1:16:58] things up. You don't have to. I'm
[1:17:00] speaking very quietly. You don't have
[1:17:02] to. You don't have to. What you really
[1:17:05] need to do. All you need to do is direct
[1:17:08] your thoughts to that altar.
[1:17:11] And a prophet says, "Your heart is the
[1:17:14] altar." We have a few hundred altars
[1:17:16] here tonight and I could say that there
[1:17:20] are some things that need to actually be
[1:17:23] annihilated
[1:17:25] on that altar. We come weighted down. We
[1:17:29] come cumber encumbered. We come in such
[1:17:33] a state, you know, distressed about
[1:17:37] things. And this world will distress
[1:17:39] you. It's a distressing place. We come
[1:17:42] troubled. We come with all and we can't
[1:17:45] we can't we're not really in a position
[1:17:47] to receive some. We need to we need to
[1:17:50] be shed of those things. There are some
[1:17:53] things that we need to actually burn up
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; and offer it to God. If I took you
[1:18:00] through the altars of the scripture,
[1:18:01] you'd find out that there's altars of
[1:18:03] sacrifice, altars of there's altars
[1:18:06] where there's peace offerings offered. I
[1:18:08] don't mean there were different off
[1:18:09] different altars necessarily, but there
[1:18:11] were different offerings on that altar.
[1:18:13] Offerings of incense, offerings of sin
[1:18:16] offerings, peace offerings, all kinds of
[1:18:19] offerings upon the altar. And we're here
[1:18:22] a myriad of people here this evening,
[1:18:25] but I would I would say that there isn't
[1:18:27] there isn't one of us, but what need to
[1:18:29] offer something? And perhaps perhaps we
[1:18:32] need to offer God something. You know,
[1:18:35] Abraham received a promise that I'm
[1:18:37] going to build an altar. I'm going to
[1:18:39] offer God something for his grace and
[1:18:41] his goodness and his promise to me. I'm
[1:18:44] going to offer something to him.
[1:18:57] Proverbs says, "For as a man thinkketh
[1:19:00] in his heart, so is he. Eat, drink, eat
[1:19:03] and drink, sayith he to thee, but his
[1:19:06] heart is not with thee. For as a man
[1:19:08] thinkketh in his heart, so is he. In
[1:19:11] Luke's gospel, Jesus said, "A good man
[1:19:14] out of the treasure of his heart
[1:19:16] bringeth forth that which is good, and
[1:19:19] an evil man out of the evil treasure of
[1:19:21] his heart bringeth forth that which is
[1:19:23] evil. for uh for of the abundance of the
[1:19:27] heart his mouth speaketh.
[1:19:32] You know this is so elementary you may
[1:19:36] think that it is almost childish but
[1:19:39] this what Jesus said and you find what
[1:19:41] people talk about.
[1:19:44] I went to pray for a woman
[1:19:48] in Ohio
[1:19:50] in a hospital and she was very ill. And
[1:19:53] I got to her bedside
[1:19:56] and she started telling me about this
[1:19:59] test and this thing had happened and
[1:20:00] that and then then and then this doctor
[1:20:02] and this specialist and this and went on
[1:20:04] and on and on and I stood there
[1:20:08] and I finally said to her, "Are you
[1:20:09] done?
[1:20:11] Are you finished? is I can't even begin
[1:20:13] to pray for you with all of this trape
[1:20:16] saying God's not interested in which
[1:20:18] doctor and what this and this medication
[1:20:20] this reaction that happened this
[1:20:22] happened that happened all of that that
[1:20:24] was that that was that need to be burned
[1:20:26] up
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; that need to be destroyed it need to get
[1:20:30] rid of that
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; in order to get into a place we can
[1:20:33] offer something say God you gave me a
[1:20:35] promise of healing you gave me a promise
[1:20:38] that what I'd ask you would do I'm going
[1:20:40] to put that on my altar And that's what
[1:20:43] I'm going to be thinking about. That's
[1:20:44] what I'm going to be concentrating on.
[1:20:46] That's going to fill my whole bosom.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to sleep with it. And
[1:20:51] I'm going to wake up with it. I am going
[1:20:53] to have my mind, not my mind, but the
[1:20:55] thought of your heart, my heart upon the
[1:20:58] altar.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Another man, I've told you this, but I
[1:21:08] feel this is appropriate. Got a phone
[1:21:10] call. Brother Ed, will you fly? My
[1:21:12] brother-in-law is dying in a hospital in
[1:21:14] the East Coast, United States. Would you
[1:21:17] please fly there and pray for him? This
[1:21:20] man had confidence. And in fact, this I
[1:21:22] think he'd been saved in one of one of
[1:21:24] the services I had. And I said, "Well,
[1:21:27] we want to do it according to scripture.
[1:21:29] You call you call your brother-in-law
[1:21:32] and find out." He was he was he was just
[1:21:34] hanging on a thread with a massive heart
[1:21:36] attack. And they I said you f you have
[1:21:39] him ask for me to come because I need to
[1:21:42] have that for the scripture. Called back
[1:21:44] in a few minutes said he wants you to
[1:21:46] come. And I took a plane the next
[1:21:48] morning flew to the eastern state. Don't
[1:21:50] even remember the city. Just landed at
[1:21:51] an airport was picked up and
[1:21:56] he and brother-in-law and the man's wife
[1:21:59] took me to the hospital and I stood
[1:22:01] outside the room and I said, "You go in
[1:22:04] first." because he's hanging on such a
[1:22:06] thin thin thread. I didn't want my
[1:22:10] presence to take his life. So I said,
[1:22:13] "You go in first and tell him I'm here
[1:22:15] to pray for him." And walked in the
[1:22:17] room. She came out, said, "Come in." And
[1:22:20] his name was Ted also. And he's laying
[1:22:22] there all hooked up
[1:22:26] and they're Greek Orthodox.
[1:22:29] And I said, "Ted," I knew he was very
[1:22:32] weak. I couldn't take much time. I said,
[1:22:34] "Ted,
[1:22:36] I want to read some scripture for you."
[1:22:38] And I read James the fifth chapter. Is
[1:22:42] any afflicted, let him pray. Is any
[1:22:45] sick, let them call for the elders of
[1:22:47] the church. And the prayer of faith and
[1:22:50] anoint them with oil. And I explained
[1:22:52] the oil. I said, "Your priest anoints
[1:22:54] you for death, but I am anointing you
[1:22:57] for life."
[1:22:59] And I read all the scripture, several
[1:23:01] verses,
[1:23:03] and I said, "Ted, how does that sound?"
[1:23:07] He said in his weak voice, "Sounds like
[1:23:11] the whole package."
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; I anointed him with oil, brother Ernie.
[1:23:16] And in 10 days, he was up out of that
[1:23:18] hospital.
[1:23:20] Hallelujah. And went and retired down in
[1:23:23] Florida.
[1:23:25] I didn't know anymore. I did I did I did
[1:23:27] what I was called to do. Left the rest
[1:23:30] up to God. But now one woman that was a
[1:23:33] believer, she could just couldn't stop.
[1:23:34] Her her mouth was just a fountain of all
[1:23:36] the doctors and all of this and all the
[1:23:39] reports and everything else. And next
[1:23:40] man at the reading of the scripture just
[1:23:42] said, "Sounds like the whole package."
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; I trust I'll see him on the other side.
[1:23:50] Someone who received the whole package,
[1:23:52] body, spirit, and soul. Amen. Do you
[1:23:56] believe it?
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I do believe it. It just shows the
[1:23:59] difference of what one person had on his
[1:24:01] heart and what the next person had on
[1:24:03] their heart. Can I spend just a few more
[1:24:05] minutes and I am going to just close.
[1:24:07] And it says
[1:24:09] it says of the of Elijah. It says here
[1:24:13] that he is repaired the altar. And then
[1:24:16] it goes on
[1:24:19] and uh the the scripture which we know
[1:24:23] Malachi 4 said he'll turn turn the heart
[1:24:30] turn the heart of the children back to
[1:24:33] the fathers. We've not only been
[1:24:36] repaired.
[1:24:38] Oh my. This master sculptor building a
[1:24:41] masterpiece. We haven't only been
[1:24:43] repaired, but our hearts have literally
[1:24:46] been turned back to return back to God.
[1:24:50] And the same scripture is is referenced
[1:24:52] right here.
[1:24:54] And then this the the verse that brother
[1:24:57] Brandham uses all the times. For the
[1:24:59] word of God is quick and powerful,
[1:25:01] sharper than any two-edged sword,
[1:25:04] piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[1:25:06] of soul and spirit, and of the joints
[1:25:07] and marrow, and is a discerner of the
[1:25:10] thoughts and intents of the heart, the
[1:25:14] intents of the heart. The word is a
[1:25:17] discerner of the intents
[1:25:20] of the heart.
[1:25:22] Let's
[1:25:32] let you think about it a while.
[1:25:35] What do you have on your altar?
[1:25:40] What is it that really
[1:25:43] consumes
[1:25:47] consumes you
[1:25:51] in the daytime? I've been preaching for
[1:25:53] a number of weeks and I've been very
[1:25:56] conscious of something and that is I
[1:26:00] don't want to preach. I don't have any
[1:26:02] itch to preach to preach but I have an I
[1:26:06] have a insatiable desire to see people
[1:26:10] moved
[1:26:11] by what is said. I find that Jesus spoke
[1:26:14] some very very simple messages. The
[1:26:17] greatest minister that ever preached the
[1:26:21] Bible says he began to preach. Brother
[1:26:23] Brandham says, "Oh, I'd love to have sat
[1:26:25] there and listened to him. I'd love to
[1:26:27] have heard him. Wouldn't you? If we'
[1:26:29] have sat there, we'd have said, "Those
[1:26:31] things are so simple." It wasn't the
[1:26:33] simplicity merely, friends. It was that
[1:26:36] there was something that was there to
[1:26:38] back it up. And I have asked God and I
[1:26:41] believe because of what I've heard from
[1:26:43] the people, the emails that I've gotten,
[1:26:46] the voice, the the phone calls that I've
[1:26:49] gotten, the handshakes that I've gotten,
[1:26:52] and not not myself only, but what's
[1:26:55] coming over the pulpit is having a very
[1:26:57] great effect. I'm getting it far and
[1:27:00] wide. I say, friends,
[1:27:03] God, I believe that God is taking us a
[1:27:05] step, a step at a time. I see God doing
[1:27:08] some very deep things. Not that people
[1:27:10] say, uh, oh, it was a great service. I'm
[1:27:13] not referring to that. I'm talking about
[1:27:15] people who have run into stone walls,
[1:27:20] have come to places in their life that
[1:27:22] they felt they couldn't get over and
[1:27:25] find now that the word is moving that
[1:27:28] out of the way. The word is doing a work
[1:27:31] in their hearts and lives. I believe
[1:27:33] God's getting us ready for a change of
[1:27:36] the body and to get us out of here.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There may have been things
[1:27:46] that, you know, we could tolerate or we
[1:27:48] could have and maybe things between
[1:27:50] husbands and wives or between children
[1:27:53] and parents or whatever more. But I
[1:27:56] don't believe that can I don't believe
[1:27:57] that that can continue to be a part of
[1:28:01] the rapture scene.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; I really don't I believe that the altar
[1:28:06] of God is a sacred place that's been set
[1:28:09] up and you have an altar and your heart
[1:28:12] is that altar. I'm going to I'm going to
[1:28:15] just uh uh take a a few more minutes,
[1:28:18] probably five minutes, 10 at the very
[1:28:20] most.
[1:28:23] the secrets of the heart.
[1:28:29] And why are people so tossed about?
[1:28:32] Brother Brandham said, "Now, the first
[1:28:34] time I spoke with you, and this is where
[1:28:37] I sat,
[1:28:39] young people, down in the about three
[1:28:43] rows from the front, the night I saw the
[1:28:44] blind girl healed,
[1:28:47] and he was taking everybody by the
[1:28:49] hand."
[1:28:51] very good friends of mine.
[1:28:54] He said, "Now,
[1:28:56] if God heals
[1:28:59] you, I'm going to ask everyone to close
[1:29:01] their eyes, but I'll keep ask you to
[1:29:03] keep your eyes open and you watch my
[1:29:06] hand." He said, "If my hand
[1:29:09] does not become normal, if my hand
[1:29:12] becomes normal, God has healed the
[1:29:15] child. If it does not become normal,
[1:29:18] said God has chosen not to heal the
[1:29:21] child. And that's what he's referring to
[1:29:23] here. He said he took the hands of the
[1:29:26] people and told them what was wrong. And
[1:29:28] the second pull, the second pull, why?
[1:29:30] He said when you did, you would know the
[1:29:33] secrets of their hearts. And he told
[1:29:35] them ahead of time. Now the second pull
[1:29:39] will know the secrets. The secret the
[1:29:42] secret of the altar. Oh, not some deep,
[1:29:45] dark, clouded, evil thing, but the thing
[1:29:49] that was weighed on your heart. And
[1:29:52] you'd been blessed if you'd have studied
[1:29:54] with me today. Brother Brand says, "And
[1:29:57] the thing that's on your heart, and the
[1:30:00] thing that's on your heart, and the
[1:30:01] thing that you're holding on your heart,
[1:30:03] and how many," he'd say, "Well, you're
[1:30:05] so nervous. You're so very nervous." And
[1:30:08] then he go and tell them why they were
[1:30:11] nervous and reveal the secret of their
[1:30:14] altar.
[1:30:18] And that Elijah ministry
[1:30:21] was being honored by God
[1:30:24] to consume that thing so they would be
[1:30:27] free of it and walk out. What you have
[1:30:31] on your heart, you've got a girl on your
[1:30:34] heart and that girl is not here. That
[1:30:37] girl is in insane asylum and calls her
[1:30:40] sister Orders. That's brother Mike
[1:30:42] Orders's mother, the song leader for
[1:30:44] brother Dan Daisley. That's his mother.
[1:30:47] You got a girl on your heart, your
[1:30:50] daughter, and she's an insane
[1:30:52] institution. Go your way, Mrs. Orders.
[1:30:56] You talk about taking something off of
[1:30:59] the altar of a person's heart because
[1:31:02] how can a person how can an individual
[1:31:06] really come into the presence of God and
[1:31:09] have something that's gnawing and
[1:31:11] twisting and burdening them and crushing
[1:31:13] them and distressing them and pressing
[1:31:15] them down. And what God wants to do
[1:31:18] tonight and want to take anxiety and
[1:31:20] take it off your altar, consume it. And
[1:31:23] you need to say, "I give it to you. Let
[1:31:26] the fire of the Holy Spirit consume
[1:31:29] this. Let fire come from heaven. Let
[1:31:32] fire destroy this, annihilate it, and
[1:31:35] let it go up in smoke that I never see
[1:31:37] it again, never feel it again."
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; You're holding some little thing or
[1:31:46] holding some thing of the world on your
[1:31:48] heart. I tell you, God can never meet
[1:31:50] you. You can never have. This service
[1:31:52] will be a dead place for you. Church
[1:31:54] will be a a doldrum for you. But if you
[1:31:57] let it go,
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; if you let it go,
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; if you'll offer it, offer it. Freely
[1:32:03] offer it. God's not going to force you.
[1:32:05] You got to freely offer it now. I'm
[1:32:08] laying it here. I'm giving it up.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Will you do it?
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Can you do it?
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; I'm giving it up. I'm laying it here.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; You don't want to keep it. You don't
[1:32:20] want to hold that thing. You want to
[1:32:22] give it up.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; I can maybe hear you say, "Well, I have
[1:32:29] a right." You sure do. I have a right to
[1:32:32] hold that. I have a right to have that
[1:32:34] feeling. Maybe you do. I have a right to
[1:32:37] be heard. I have a right.
[1:32:41] Oh, I could tell. I could write you a
[1:32:42] book.
[1:32:47] I could write you a book.
[1:32:52] People have held things and just twisted
[1:32:54] them up terribly,
[1:32:56] but oh, if you'd only offer it on God's
[1:32:59] altar.
[1:33:01] Hallelujah.
[1:33:03] Hallelujah.
[1:33:05] Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Don't look at me as though you have you
[1:33:08] don't know what I'm talking about. You
[1:33:09] know exactly what I'm talking about. You
[1:33:11] got some hurt and you've held something
[1:33:14] and people call it a chip on the
[1:33:16] shoulder. This is this is this is right
[1:33:18] down home where we live.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well,
[1:33:24] that's why David said, "Know my heart."
[1:33:28] Because often we don't know it
[1:33:29] ourselves. We could be sitting here
[1:33:31] tonight and we don't know. Said,
[1:33:33] "Brother Ed, I don't know what you're
[1:33:34] talking about. I just feel free." I say,
[1:33:36] "Praise God. Just thank him for it." And
[1:33:38] if you if you're in that condition, just
[1:33:41] thank him for it. And now you say, "Am I
[1:33:43] done?" No, I'm not done. say what can I
[1:33:46] give him? What can I offer him? I like
[1:33:50] to take the choice instead of coming you
[1:33:54] know uh the give him the very last or
[1:33:58] the tail end of something. I'm going to
[1:34:00] give him the best. I'll give him the
[1:34:02] best of the day. I'll give him the best
[1:34:04] of my time.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:16] For if our heart condemn us,
[1:34:19] if our heart condemn us,
[1:34:22] God is greater than our heart
[1:34:25] and knoweth all things. If our heart
[1:34:28] condemn us,
[1:34:32] I can tell you one thing for sure. You
[1:34:34] just can't get what you're supposed to
[1:34:36] get out of a service if you come
[1:34:37] condemned. If you come feeling God wants
[1:34:41] to burn that condemnation,
[1:34:44] burn that thing so that you'll be
[1:34:47] guiltree.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Absolutely guiltree.
[1:35:00] Would you like Brother Brenham's
[1:35:02] example?
[1:35:06] one of his last services,
[1:35:08] his his example. I'll give you his
[1:35:11] example to follow.
[1:35:13] He said, "This is not the day of
[1:35:14] Pentecost. The Pentecostal age is
[1:35:17] passed. Pentecost is gone. This is
[1:35:19] harvest time." And he says, "And
[1:35:22] brother, sister, I lay myself
[1:35:27] on the altar tonight also
[1:35:30] calling others." But here he is in the
[1:35:33] very he he's only got a few days that
[1:35:36] he's going to be God's going to have him
[1:35:38] still with us. And he says, "I lay
[1:35:40] myself on the altar."
[1:35:43] What a blessed thing to be able to take
[1:35:45] a person's life and say, "I just lay
[1:35:48] myself on the altar. All that I am." And
[1:35:51] that's why I sang it. All that I have,
[1:35:53] all that I am, and all that I ever can
[1:35:55] be, I just lay myself on the altar.
[1:36:05] What was the uh altar right at the very
[1:36:08] beginning?
[1:36:10] A place of
[1:36:12] doesn't sound very nice over a pulpit. A
[1:36:15] place of slaughter.
[1:36:18] This isn't something where you, you
[1:36:19] know, you surgically do something real
[1:36:22] nice.
[1:36:24] Fact is, brother Brandham said when they
[1:36:27] brought that sin offering
[1:36:30] and they had to go and get the best
[1:36:34] had to be without blemish.
[1:36:37] They go and get that without blemish.
[1:36:39] Got not that not not not something that
[1:36:40] was lame or broken of the best and bring
[1:36:43] it
[1:36:45] bring it to the priest. And I'll say now
[1:36:49] oh I want you is this not just a story?
[1:36:51] This is what happened. Now you
[1:36:55] lay your hand on it.
[1:36:57] You lay your hand on the head,
[1:36:59] everybody. You didn't say, "Oh, brother
[1:37:00] Ed, you do it for us, or let mom and dad
[1:37:02] do it for us, or let someone else do
[1:37:04] it." No, you do it. This is your
[1:37:06] sacrifice. You lay your hand on the
[1:37:09] head,
[1:37:10] identify yourself with it, and then
[1:37:13] watch that priest. And he said, "Take a
[1:37:15] sharp stone and start to hack at the
[1:37:18] throat of this animal." And death is not
[1:37:22] a pleasant thing.
[1:37:25] Maybe some say, "I can't stand that. I
[1:37:27] can't stand the sight of blood." You'd
[1:37:29] either go guilty or stand the sight of
[1:37:31] blood.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; You had to go through that. Identify
[1:37:34] yourself with it. And that was God's
[1:37:37] commandment. You might say, "I can't
[1:37:38] figure that out. We're far too We're far
[1:37:41] too educated. We're far too cultured
[1:37:44] now. No, we're not too cultured. We've
[1:37:46] got to take some things in our stride
[1:37:49] and are things that need to be
[1:37:52] slaughtered.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; You need to become ruthless with it. The
[1:37:57] fact is you've babyed it long enough.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Say, who are you speaking to, brother
[1:38:03] Ed? I don't know, but I'm speaking to
[1:38:05] somebody. And if I only speak to one or
[1:38:07] two or five or six, that'll make me
[1:38:09] happy. And I know exactly. I know
[1:38:12] exactly. I know exactly that God God
[1:38:15] spoke to my heart today and I know
[1:38:18] precisely that this is for this
[1:38:20] congregation for this evening and God
[1:38:22] wants to move this congregation further
[1:38:24] than we've been in the past. Wants to
[1:38:27] move us further
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; and you can lay your hand on the head of
[1:38:31] that and watch it die in its death
[1:38:34] throws and know that it was your
[1:38:36] substitute. That ought to be me. It's
[1:38:39] taking my place and this blood spattered
[1:38:42] as that little animal. It wasn't a
[1:38:44] pretty thing. It wasn't some nice
[1:38:46] surgical cut. It was not that. It was a
[1:38:49] It was a removing of our guilt. And
[1:38:52] that's what happened. And this God that
[1:38:54] sent this message sent this messenger.
[1:38:57] It didn't come easy, but it came to it
[1:39:01] came to deliver us. It came to take the
[1:39:04] things that you've allowed or even even
[1:39:07] things that maybe you didn't allow. It
[1:39:09] just came your way. Just became a part
[1:39:11] of your scene.
[1:39:16] Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; I'll say amen because I know it's right
[1:39:19] dead on the target. I know it's right on
[1:39:22] the target. And we got questions. We got
[1:39:25] questions about our life. Why is my life
[1:39:28] the way that it is? Why has this
[1:39:30] happened? Why? Why this? And we got
[1:39:33] questions. And sometimes the questions
[1:39:35] actually almost like consume us. It's
[1:39:37] because it's on your heart. The
[1:39:38] questions on your heart. And if God God
[1:39:42] sent Elijah, he doesn't have to stand
[1:39:44] here tonight. Even if Elijah the
[1:39:46] Tishbite was here. Tell you what,
[1:39:49] friends, we we don't need we don't need
[1:39:51] Elijah the Tishbite. We've got the very
[1:39:55] word of God. And that word is a still
[1:39:59] the prophet didn't say William
[1:40:00] Brandham's a revealer of the secrets of
[1:40:02] the heart. The word the word the word is
[1:40:07] a revealer of the secrets of the heart
[1:40:09] and reveals what's on the the altar. Not
[1:40:14] to stand there and bring some big heavy
[1:40:16] weight upon it but to come and say I've
[1:40:20] I've come to receive the offering. Just
[1:40:24] just let it go. Offer it. Bring it
[1:40:27] willfully, willingly, and offer it to
[1:40:30] God. Hallelujah.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; And if you can't think of anything else,
[1:40:38] just do what Brother Bram said. I'll
[1:40:39] just offer my life. I'll just lay myself
[1:40:42] upon this altar. All that I have, all
[1:40:46] that I am, all I can ever be.
[1:40:50] Don't go out of the service tonight
[1:40:53] till you've determined in your heart
[1:40:56] you're going to give this God the very
[1:40:58] best.
[1:41:01] Let's just bow reverently.
[1:41:04] Father
[1:41:07] in the stillness and quietness
[1:41:11] and each person within their thoughts
[1:41:15] within their heart. Oh God,
[1:41:18] you are still the revealer of the
[1:41:20] secrets of the heart, the secrets of the
[1:41:23] altar.
[1:41:25] Lord, uh the same spirit.
[1:41:29] Oh,
[1:41:31] how heavy my heart was. and many times
[1:41:34] how heavy it has been. But you have come
[1:41:39] and oh God, oh God in your grace, you
[1:41:44] come so wonderfully
[1:41:47] rebuild something that is perhaps broken
[1:41:50] down, something that is brought into a
[1:41:53] state of disrepair.
[1:41:55] I think, oh God, of those that have just
[1:41:58] even recently I see your your hand in
[1:42:02] their life. That is such a treasure, oh
[1:42:06] father, such a treasure. And this
[1:42:09] evening, Lord, while we are here in the
[1:42:11] closing moments of this service, I pray
[1:42:14] that your sweet Holy Spirit brood out
[1:42:18] over the people, Lord, and make known,
[1:42:21] oh God, the very secret of their heart,
[1:42:24] the thing that is weighing on them. I
[1:42:28] pray, Lord, it'll be offered not
[1:42:30] something just removed off the altar,
[1:42:32] but it'll be offered as a sacrifice. and
[1:42:35] the fire of God consume, oh Lord, the
[1:42:39] offering, the offering that is being
[1:42:41] made to you. And then I pray, Lord, that
[1:42:43] you will, as you've made promises and
[1:42:45] the promises have been made so quickened
[1:42:49] to the people. And we individually,
[1:42:51] Lord, as you make the promise quickened
[1:42:54] to us, then we want to respond. We want
[1:42:58] to give you something of ourselves. We
[1:43:00] want to give you our best, Lord. We want
[1:43:02] to give you our our strength, our
[1:43:04] energy, our resources, and whatever it
[1:43:06] is that we have, we want to give it to
[1:43:09] you. We want to give it to your people.
[1:43:11] We want to bless your people, Lord. We
[1:43:13] want to bless the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:17] And we know that you will see it. We
[1:43:19] believe that you'll receive it in Jesus
[1:43:21] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:43:29] The scripture tells us
[1:43:32] that there was incense that was rising
[1:43:36] before him
[1:43:38] in the book of Revelation.
[1:43:40] And it says, you can probably say it
[1:43:42] with me, the prayers
[1:43:45] of the saints.
[1:43:50] You can offer him something this
[1:43:52] evening. You can offer him
[1:43:55] with your mouth and with your heart,
[1:43:58] with your soul. You can offer him your
[1:44:00] prayer to him and say it from the very
[1:44:05] depths. Here I am, all that I have,
[1:44:10] all that I am. Let me say something. I'm
[1:44:13] your friend tonight.
[1:44:16] When we meet on the other side,
[1:44:20] you'll not regret
[1:44:22] giving hearing the service tonight.
[1:44:25] You'll not regret being here and you'll
[1:44:27] not regret doing doing exactly
[1:44:31] what I'm counseling to you. Just give
[1:44:33] him yourself. Give him your best.
[1:44:37] Hear his promise. Hear his word.
[1:44:40] Give yourself. Give it up. Just give it
[1:44:43] up. Surrender it to him. and your life
[1:44:46] will be infinitely blessed of God.
[1:44:51] Hallelujah. Let's stand.
[1:44:58] All that I have,
[1:45:04] all that.
[1:45:09] All
[1:45:11] I shall ever
[1:45:15] [Music]
[1:45:20] can not
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:25] love
[1:45:27] my
[1:45:31] [Applause]
[1:45:32] surrender
[1:45:34] to thee
[1:45:37] as a prayer.
[1:45:41] All that
[1:45:44] [Music]
[1:45:48] I am.
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:07] I
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:13] surrender
[1:46:15] to the
[1:46:19] I feel led to have prayer
[1:46:22] with someone or some number
[1:46:27] that God has spoken to tonight.
[1:46:31] I have my eyes closed
[1:46:34] because I'm not interested in any big
[1:46:38] response. I'm interested in a quality
[1:46:41] response.
[1:46:42] I'm interested that God comes by your
[1:46:45] way. It's the only thing I'm interested
[1:46:48] in. I'm interested that God comes by.
[1:46:51] I'm interested that you are given the
[1:46:54] grace to release to release and drop
[1:46:59] this thing upon the altar and let the
[1:47:02] fire of the Holy Spirit come and remove
[1:47:07] it by a fire and let it vanish into
[1:47:12] another into another realm. Let it
[1:47:14] vanish by God's divine flame.
[1:47:19] Oh God,
[1:47:21] send I pray the very fires of God. The
[1:47:26] flame, the flame that burned in the
[1:47:29] bush, the flame, the pillar of fire that
[1:47:32] moved the people, the licks of fire that
[1:47:35] was upon the people, oh God, for you
[1:47:38] said in your word, they were all in one
[1:47:41] place and they were in one accord. And
[1:47:44] the fire of God, the licks of fire were
[1:47:48] on and God came and took control of the
[1:47:51] people. Come, Father, in the name of
[1:47:54] Jesus Christ, your son, come and take
[1:47:57] control of the people. I pray oh God you
[1:48:00] remove oh Lord and give the power give
[1:48:04] grass grace and grant the people the
[1:48:06] power and the deliverance to let go of
[1:48:09] their own grip and their own hands that
[1:48:12] they will not grasp these things any
[1:48:14] longer. put it on the altar of their
[1:48:17] heart and say, "Here it is, oh God. You
[1:48:20] will consume it. I give it to you. All
[1:48:23] that I am." And Lord, there are others
[1:48:26] that are here. I stand here tonight,
[1:48:29] Father, myself saying, "Oh God, I've
[1:48:32] heard your promise of this hour. I've
