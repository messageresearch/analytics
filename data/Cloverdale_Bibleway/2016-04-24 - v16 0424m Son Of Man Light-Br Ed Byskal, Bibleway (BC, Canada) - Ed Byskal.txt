I'm so thankful for the leading of the savior in our lives and it's uh number 812. Brother Ed mentioned this song last Sunday and I uh I looked it up and it's a an old Fanny Crosby song and there's a little testimony. she had uh had need of a little bit of uh funds financially in her life and and as it was her way, she began to pray. And um it didn't take too long and someone came by her door and all she needed was $5, but the Lord provided. [Music] It's the Holy Spirit. Let's just sing it together. All the way my Savior leads me. What have I to ask beside can I doubt his tender mercy? Who through life has been my God. Heavenly peace divided comfort here by faith in him to dwell.

Holy Spirit, [Music] Lord, Holy Spirit, glory as I lift my hands to worship and You magnify thy name. Holy Spirit through me. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. We have some prayer requests here this morning. um says, "Please pray for the Anderson's baby girl born this last week. Doctors have found a hole in her heart and will have to do surgery in the next couple of weeks. They are praying for a miracle so the doctors won't have to do surgery." Amen. Uh could you please pray for a young mother with five children? Been told she has arthritis that's keeping her from caring for her children. It's an unspoken request and brother Javier writes in um the earthquake that took place in Ecuador last week. There's a pastor that has died when the church crumbled and some brothers with him had also passed away. Others are still missing. pastor's daughter also passed away last night and we just want to remember that need before the Lord and it's uh very tragic and there's a church without a shepherd and we just pray that God will intervene and have his way and many needs here this morning. We just bring them before the Lord and God is able to supply all of our needs. He is that great fountain. The inexhaustible fountain. &gt;&gt; His hand is not too His arm is not too short. His hand is not weak, but he is able to provide. Amen. Just going to ask brother John Andes to come and take us before the throne of grace. Bless you, brother John. Amen. If you have a need, just hold it up before the Lord. He knows all about it, but he wants our faith just to make a connection. Our heavenly father, we thank you for the atmosphere that's in this service. We thank you for the songs that we've been able to sing. Each one of them have spoken of leadership, have spoken of our faith being released. To you our great shepherd, to you our father, to you our provider, to you our husband. Lord, we come this morning with faith believing, lifting up our hands, Lord, as a group of people, as a congregation of believers, just inviting your Holy Spirit to come into this meeting. Come into our lives, Lord Jesus. Each one of us are so needy without you, Lord. We are nothing, Father. We want to repent of any sins, Lord, and lay our lives out before this altar as bear, Lord. We need your appearing, Lord, and your presence this morning. As these needs were read out and as lives are bare before you, we live in a desperate time, God. We live in a very troublesome hour, Lord. Men's hearts are failing them for fear and lives are being shredded by Satan's plans and schemes, Lord. But we believe your plan is greater than all of Satan's plans. the plan of redemption, the plan of salvation, the plan of healing, God, the plan of deliverance. Father, you are our comforter. You are our joy. You are our peace, Lord. And Lord, we want to confess, Lord, your attributes are greater than any of Satan's plans from the from the garden. And even before when he was cast out of heaven, it's always been his scheme to undermine and break trust. But today, Lord, after all these years, Lord, we're so happy that you're standing on the earth and a group of people, Lord, that love your appearing, God. We're under that spirit of prophecy that there would be a bride rise up in the last days that would believe you for the impossible and the dead have been raised up, Lord. Miracles have been done, healings, Lord, and lives that have been brought out of sin, Lord. us listening to your prophet talking about the woman at the well, how her life was crashed and crushed going through five husbands and married to another man. And Lord, but when she heard the word for her day, she didn't need that water pot no more. She just dropped it, Lord, and ran into the city. Lord, may we today have that great liberation of faith that our Messiah is here. The answer is here. The very answer to our request is within this building, the Lord Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father, we want to bring these three requests, Lord, that were spoken out, Lord, so needy. Thinking of the one that was born with a hole in its heart, Lord, but Lord, there's been those in our own assembly. Little children have been born with heart problems, and you, Lord, have done a change within their lives, God, physically, spiritually. Lord, we all had a hole in our heart. Would you touch this little life, Lord God, and the mother, Lord, that has need, Lord, this arthritis attacking her, Lord, this request with children, Father. I'm just thinking, Lord, how Satan comes to those that are so needy and tries to make it even worse, Lord. We're holding on to your word, God. You're the creator of life. You're the creator, God, that can speak to a womb and bring life today. And this last request, Lord, the pastor and Ecuador and his own daughter and family and believers crushed, Lord. Father, would you come by that way today? Be the shepherd to the elect, oh God. You will not lose one of your seed, oh God. Lord, there's great faith within the building today, God. You're moving, Lord, within our souls, Lord. And I pray you'd comfort lives, Lord, and be with families, be with hearts that are even broken today, even in our own midst, Lord. There's unspoken requests. Some have their hands lifted up, Lord, like it was reaching out for a lifeline. Lord, may you come and meet our needs today. May you pour out your service, Lord. Your your spirit in the service, oh God, through our pastor, through the anointed channel, God. May you meet every need in divine presence, unspoken hearts and lives that are quivering, even shaking. Maybe they're so in a place of doubt or fear. Satan's got them. But may you turn it around, Lord, and bring faith today to our hearts. Lord, you have done so well over the years by taking care of us just right. And we want to give you glory, Lord, and believe for the impossible. There is nothing that is impossible with you, Lord. Even bless the offering and multiply it, God, and use it, Lord, to take this message around the world and continually even behind this pulpit. May the Holy Spirit continue to lead and guide us as we look to you today for the answers. Lord Jesus, we believe you, Lord. We believe the spoken word today has the answers for the very heart's cry within our bosom. Come, Lord Jesus, come. And you'll bring it across the platform and minister it even throughout Reinton today in Victoria and throughout this whole Northwest, Lord, and throughout the world. Your Holy Spirit is meeting the elect, the bride of Jesus Christ. We thank you for that, Lord. Go with us throughout this day, gentle shepherd and lead and guide us in your word. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. We thank you and give you glory, Lord, and appreciate you, Lord, for your present, close, near. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John, you may have your seats as you take up the offering this morning. God bless you. Praise the Lord. [Music] We'll sing a couple courses while they take up the offering. And Brother Andrew's got a special with the choir and we'll have them come up right after we sing a couple of courses. Let's just sing. Why don't you lead me to the rock that is higher than I? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you lead me to the rock that is higher than I lead? [Music] Why don't you lead me to the rock that is higher than I? Oh, thou has been a shelter for me. I don't believe you that is higher than I don't lead me to the rock that is higher behavior [Music] to the rock that is higher than for me. Why don't you rock that is higher than I? Thou has been a shelter for me. Amen. God bless you. Amen. God bless you this morning. Um, I just want to say this song was written by a sister in Florida who's passed away now, but um, she wrote it during a hurricane and they were all evacuated and uh, she worked for the state, I believe, documenting damage and stuff. And, um, when she got the report of what had happened to her home in her area, she began to write these words down. So, I trust that it'll bless you. And um I just want to thank everybody singing here because they didn't know about this until midnight last night, each one of them and the musicians. So just want to thank you all. [Music] Strong winds are blowing with an unrelenting force. People running to and fro. They don't know what's going on. Men's hearts are failing because of turmoil in the land. Church doors are closing. Preachers just can't take a stand. But it's going to take a stronger wind than this to keep me from my promises. It's going to take a stronger wind than this to turn me around. It's going to take a stronger wind than this &gt;&gt; because my feet are on solid ground. [Music] People are searching for the true and living God. There's a famine in the land and the word seems null and void. [Music] They have eyes but cannot see. They have ears but cannot hear. If they only knew the scripture, they know Jesus Christ is here. But it's going to take a stronger wind than this won't keep me from my promises. It's going to take a stronger wind than this to turn me around. It's going to take a stronger wind than this because my feet are on solid ground. [Music] Christians are living no different than the world. [Music] Claiming to know the Lord, but truly serving other gods. They call on him both day and night, but they can't produce the light. Anointed ones in the end time, rejecting the only Jesus Christ. But it's going to take a stronger wind than this. Won't you keep me from my promises? It's going to take a stronger wind than this to turn me around. It's going to take a stronger wind than this &gt;&gt; because my feet are on solid ground. Oh, it's going to take a stronger wind than this. to keep me from my promises. It's going to take a stronger wind than this to turn me around. It's going to take a stronger wind than this because my feet are on solid ground. Oh, it's going to take a stronger wind than this &gt;&gt; to keep me from my promises. It's going to take a stronger wind than this to turn me around. It's going to take a stronger wind than this because my feet are on solid ground. Amen. [Music] [Applause] Thank you, brother Andrew and choir and musicians. We really appreciate that so much. I just love songs of declaration. The bride rising up and taking her position. Amen. Just thrills my soul. Praise God. Let's just sing that song as brother Ed comes. God is good all the time. Puts a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good [Music] all the time. He puts a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. Through the dark night, it lights. God is good. God is good all the time. When you're walking through the valley and the shadow all around [Music] God will guide me. We will be sing and glory and bright [Music] and worthy [Music] all the time. He puts a song of praise in this part of my God is good all the time through his life. God is good. Oh, he's so good all the time. Let's all stand in the sixth and second verse. Oh, we were sinners. Oh, I'm worthy. But for I see to die to the Holy Spirit and testify that his love is everlasting and his mercy. All day and God is good all the time. [Music] God is good all the time. Through the darkest night, his light still shines. God is good. God is good. all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen to that. &gt;&gt; He's certainly been faithful, hasn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Led you this week, protected you, provided, &gt;&gt; brought us all together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just have a word of prayer before we turn to the word. Dear heavenly father, &gt;&gt; you're the almighty one, the giver of all good gifts. &gt;&gt; You're the giver of life. You have given us salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've given us a message. &gt;&gt; You have come down and proven it. You have confirmed and vindicated. &gt;&gt; You have been so liberal, oh God, with your presence. &gt;&gt; You've come amongst us. You've come to us in our homes, in our cars, in our bedrooms. &gt;&gt; You've come to us at the strangest times and you have spoken. &gt;&gt; You know how to speak to hearts. And so I pray that this morning you will cause me to say words, Lord, that will stay in the hearts of the people. Perhaps just a word or a phrase. Perhaps something you will take out of the message, out of the scriptures and illuminate us. Oh God, I ask that you will illuminate us. Help us to understand not only that where we are this morning in a sanctuary, but help us to understand Lord that you have us where we are in your program in Jesus name for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to have some scripture reading. Going to be doing some things different today. &gt;&gt; And I guess that'll be Don't be don't be spooked with what's covered here. It's very simple. It's just I want to make some reference to tapes and and the things that we have done, things that you have done, and I want to bring it to the scripture and ask some very serious questions. you know, uh, even the prophet of God when he was speaking, he didn't always declare precisely where we are. It's always been a a a I will say a bit of a problem with humans. One of our weaknesses is we are uh very very weak to realize where we are and where we are in time. Uh for example, Jesus said to the disciples they they asked a question. And they said, "Why do the Pharisees say?" So now it was something that they were asking of the religious leaders. Why do the Pharisees say that Elias or Elijah must first come? And Jesus said, "Well, he he he will come and fulfill all things, but I say unto thee that he's come already, and you and they missed it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. That's the weakness I'm talking about of something happening and it passes by and then we Oh, that's what happened. We don't want to do that. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be far better to be in tune &gt;&gt; if God made it available for you to be in tune? And so maybe this morning we'll just tweak it a wee bit, &gt;&gt; turn up our our interest or our make us more keen. Now if you think that we've just come to a Sunday service and you know this will be another service, well that's what it'll be. &gt;&gt; But if you think well maybe there's something to this. I should be I should be a little more alert. I should just give myself. That's what I would ask you to do. And brother Brandamman, I think in the service of the message u souls that are in prison one and the other message would be sers is this the time and he asked is is this the time? Is this it friends? Is is this the time? He wasn't absolutely certain himself of is this the time? He said and he was so earnest about it. He said, "I've got friends. I've got family here. Is this the time? Is Is this where we're at?" So, I don't know if I'll be able to get to it, but I want to ask us, you know, when I get into some of the scriptures and the phrases of the messages, you say, "Well, I've heard that before." No, you haven't heard it in this particular vein or direction before because I've been asking myself this for a very long time and now I've been working for quite a long time some weeks just to try to put this together and uh so we will we will look to the scripture. I would like to call the service today my comments to you will be son of man light. I want to speak about the light and the son of man light and then we will be going to scriptures. I'm going to have the scriptures on the on the screen first because I'm reading a number of scriptures and it would be uh uh maybe a distraction for you to try to follow one verse at a time. So, we could dim the lights please, a little bit if we would. Then Jesus spoke again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world. He that followth, and I want to stop there. Followeth is a a verb. It is an action word. That means there's is is progressive. &gt;&gt; He that followth me. And you can't follow Jesus as it was back then because he was in a physical form. So what does that mean to you and I? He that followeth or progressive followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life. &gt;&gt; So to walk is to be progressive. To follow is to be progressive. We should not be today where we were last week. &gt;&gt; In other words, we are to be progressive. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin. Now friends, we're not reading a story book. We're not reading a paperback. We are reading the word of God. And it and it clearly declares that our fellowship is based upon our fellowship with one another is based upon walking or if we walk in the light as he is in the light. It's progressive once again. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship somehow. We got that same one there. So we'll go on to the next one. F for ye were sometimes darkness, &gt;&gt; but now are you light &gt;&gt; in the Lord. Walk as children of light. &gt;&gt; Ye are all the children of light and the children of the day. We are not of the night. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Nor of the darkness. &gt;&gt; I love that. You are the children of light. &gt;&gt; In other words, you're the children of you're you're the product of life. &gt;&gt; You are the sons and daughters of light. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture is saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not the product of. We are the offspring of the light. &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters born of the light. You were of the light. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Either that or we're of a denomination or we're of a church or we're of a club or we're of a society. But the but Jesus is saying in the scripture, you are of the light. You are a product of the light. You stand here today. You say, "Well, I'm the product of my mother and father." It's got to go beyond that. as your mother and father, you'll die like your mother and father. You'll die like your grandparents, but we're something more than that. &gt;&gt; And the question is, where did the light come from? And that's what we'll be going into. You may have your seats. that there are many forms of light. The Bible tells us that God in the beginning he made two great lights. The greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and he made the stars also. So he made the sun. We have electricity powers our homes, power so many things, wanting to power cars, equipment, and if we had uh a power outage, things really become very chaotic quickly. And then there's uh power for our equipment and power actually laser power. I could take a laser here and and and it would you'd have a light on the screen and you'd be able to see what I want to point at. A laser the actually the term laser which I didn't know until I had just run into this. It is the short for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation laser. That's where it comes from. &gt;&gt; And laser, they have laser therapy and laser. I had a very, very bad cut on this finger and it was black and it was dark and it was a large cut almost to the bone. Did it up hunting and I had to go to a hospital in Cornell. Got there late at night and they had a doctor come in and stitch the thing up. But it was all dark with soot because it happened on a with a stove. And I thought, well, am I going to go through life like that? And I spoke with brother Otto here and he spoke to a specialist and they have a special laser thing. I had to put lead uh over my eyes and so on. And he's got a little deal and uh he just comes and goes. He's zapping this thing. And I said, "What? Well, what is that doing? It just felt like a elastic was snapping on my hand. I said, "What is that doing?" And he just kind of smiles. And he's got special goggles on as well. And he says, "Well, it just breaks it up." And uh your blood will carry it away. And I thought, "Praise God, God's got a laser light, too." and he just zaps my soul and my heart and all the unbelief and the blood carries it away. So I got a message out of that. I thought that was fantastic and now you can't see it. You can't see it at all thanks to laser. So I'm happy that they have you know devised and uh uh have come up with some of these uh advancements. So, we have laser surgery, laser optics, and scanners, and laser printers, and on and on and on we go. So, we're thankful for that. And I can have a switch. I was going to bring a switch, an electrical switch. Well, it's not worth very much, maybe worth 30 cents, but and it has a switch on it. And you say, well, you know where we got switches all over here. But the switch wouldn't do any good if it didn't have a source of power. &gt;&gt; So, you've got to be connected. You may you may be able to switch things on and switch things off, but you've got to be connected to a power source. And then something that I was interested in and it's amazing how it spiritually applies as well. There are conductors. There are certain metals that are very very good to conduct power. Isn't that right, brother Joe Waldner? Our electrician in-house electrician. So you have metals that will be very very good to conduct power and to send it and in fact is I understand that there are three metals that are very very good. Pure silver, pure copper and pure gold. Those are the three top ones. Pure silver, pure copper and pure gold. They will be the best conductors of electricity and to give us power. But on the other hand, there's also something that they call resistors, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So in a church, we want to be a conductor but not a resistor. &gt;&gt; And a carbon carbon are resistors. They make resistors, all kinds of resistors. And it depends on what kind of current it is and how you want to resist it. And so equipment is full of resistors, &gt;&gt; you know, all all electronics we've got up here. And we've got power coming in, but there will be one place, you know, and this is all part of the scheme and part of tech technology. So we want something to resist. But when it comes to the power of God &gt;&gt; and when it comes to the light of the gospel, we only want conductors. &gt;&gt; We don't need resistors. &gt;&gt; And it's an amazing thing in the scripture. It talks about Janice and Jambre &gt;&gt; and they were resistors. &gt;&gt; They resisted the gospel. They resisted Moses and they to their own loss and damnation. They resisted what God was doing. And there are many that resist the message &gt;&gt; because they feel that it doesn't agree with what I think. Who cares what I think? &gt;&gt; Who cares what anybody thinks? Who cares what a school of theology develops? Who cares about that? They've been in confusion for hundreds of years and they want me to extend that or they want you to extend it. No, I I don't want anything to do with that. I want to something that God has evidenced and proven this is a power &gt;&gt; and that this is a light &gt;&gt; and it's a light for your life. &gt;&gt; It's a light to give you a direction. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't you can't even the most serious things in life you are you are helpless to make succeed &gt;&gt; people there used to be a phrase and there still is a phrase I want to be happy. Oh is that something new? I want to be happy. Everybody wants to be happy. And so religious and uh Christian movements get on that say well you want to be happy come and join us. I can tell you that doesn't make a person happy. When you just join somebody, but when you become joined to Christ and you're free from your sins, you will be automatically happy and you will be connected to a supernatural power that will give a light into your life. And tell me, let me tell you friends, I've experienced that even recently where we have to have a light. We have to have God to do things supernaturally in our lives. &gt;&gt; And when he does, honor it. &gt;&gt; When he does, thank him for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, are we all right? &gt;&gt; You got along where I'm going. So, we have conductors and we have resistors. And we want to say that light serves many purposes but none as important. And I'm going slow for a purpose. Light serves many purposes but none I'm talking about you. None as important as spiritual enlightenment. &gt;&gt; And that's why I read the scriptures. Jesus said, "I am the light of the world." And I can tell you that's a light that the hydro company can never produce. &gt;&gt; There's no generator that can ever produce this kind of light. It's a glorious light. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire was a light. And it attracted Moses, who wasn't a prophet yet, but he was born a prophet. &gt;&gt; And he didn't know why he was what he was to do. And he didn't know how he was to do it. And he's off in the wilderness as a failure, as a vagabond, as a murderer. &gt;&gt; He killed a man. And this man's going to be a prophet. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, God knows what he's doing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we walk in the light, how do you walk in the light? &gt;&gt; What kind of light is this? &gt;&gt; It's not a light you just switch on and off. What kind of light is it? I'll tell you when you need There isn't a person here, I'm not preaching to just a few. There isn't a person here, there isn't a person streaming this service today that doesn't need a divine light of this son of man shining in their life or you will never make it successfully through life. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; There's a light of knowledge. There's a light of wisdom. There's a light that we gain educationally. But let me tell you that light will never guide you. There are people that are very very intelligent &gt;&gt; and I just saw a documentary on Einstein and a prophet of God said that Einstein uh almost broke into God's laboratory into God's laboratory. He almost had discovered but he just lacked the supernatural aspect. He had the theory of relativity and changed things of the uh uh was considered the brightest brain. And then we have Stephen Hawking and these men I I went and heard Stephen Hawking down in uh Vancouver and he has to speak through a computer voice and so he has but he took questions and I I admired him for taking questions from the public and then uh with his computer and his assistant he's answering complex questions on the universe and on the particles and on uh the bend ing of light waves and so on. All these kind of questions that don't really pertain to life and he's terribly crippled. He's in a terrible terrible condition in this wheelchair and he's all crippled up like this. And I thought that how how sad and how inequitable it is that you know I'm here in a full body and strength and there he is and all that wisdom and all that knowledge. But I thought if he only knew, &gt;&gt; if he only knew that the Lord Jesus Christ, God himself &gt;&gt; who spoke, "Let there be light," that God has to say that to you and me, has to say that to you as an individual. And the younger you get it, the better it'll be. &gt;&gt; You need God to speak, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; I want the light. I want my blessing. And my blessing will bring light to this young person and will bring light to this young man, this young woman, and will guide this family through life. Listen to me, friends. You need this light &gt;&gt; that I'm preaching about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "For God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined into our hearts." &gt;&gt; Amen. to give the light. Why did he shine into our hearts? I want you listening very carefully. To give the light of knowledge. That's true knowledge. This isn't to give the light of an opinion, to give the light of some human decision, to give the light of what might come out of the a a Bible school or a school of theology or some other place or some university or Harvard or some other wonderful place. You need a personal encounter with the author of light &gt;&gt; to give you the light of knowledge of the knowledge of the glory of God &gt;&gt; in the face of Jesus Christ. Now, I'm hesitant a wee bit because I'm going to be getting off into areas that are hard to describe. You'll need every ounce of gray matter that you have, every ounce of spiritual guidance, and you need to pray, "Father, let me catch what it is you're seeking to convey. &gt;&gt; I can't perhaps put it into words exactly, but I I'm commencing now to get into some thick water. &gt;&gt; Do I have your attention? &gt;&gt; For God who commanded the light, God commanded the light to shine out of darkness when you knew nothing about him. When you're in darkness and you have all kind of rig religiosity and ideas and your own ideas and your own culture, you needed God. &gt;&gt; We might be Canadian or American or African or European or whatever we are, but we need God. &gt;&gt; The spirit of our nation couldn't give us this light. &gt;&gt; Your education can never give you this light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your human intelligence from your background or your parents or whatever more, your IQ will never give you this light. &gt;&gt; Settle that, friends. We're lost in darkness. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter where we are, we can't come to the house of God with any human pride. We have nothing to offer. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? We have nothing to offer. &gt;&gt; Amen. God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined into our hearts. And the purpose is to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in in the face in the countenance of Jesus Christ. And when John saw the Lord Jesus Christ, one like unto the son of man in the in Revelation chapter 1 when he saw him and he end up this was John who walked with him. This was John who ate with him. This is John who who who stayed in the desert with him. This was John who knew him so well. But when he saw him in this light, &gt;&gt; he fell down at his feet as one dead. He didn't have anything to offer. He didn't say, "Well, I was a friend of the high priest. &gt;&gt; I was a friend who got Peter into the judgment hall. I I I knew you so well." No, he didn't know this one. &gt;&gt; He knew him at the moment for the moment. You may know him &gt;&gt; when he spoke to you at camp. &gt;&gt; You may know him as he spoke to you and dealt with you in a certain moment of your life. But now we're progressing on. You're not where you were one week ago. You're progressing on. You need this light. You don't know what's happening tomorrow. You don't know what's going to happen in the world tomorrow. I can tell you, you're living in a very dangerous world. Tell me that this isn't a very dangerous world. Earthquakes happening where they don't know they're supposed to happen or that they will happen. All kinds of all kinds of powers. The economy goes up, the economy goes down. You don't know anything. You can't power. You can't guide that power. You need a light. &gt;&gt; You need a light to guide your life so that you can say Jesus led me all the way. &gt;&gt; And so in the light of his countenance and that is the the word face is actually the first word is vision. to look at or to allow oneself to be seen to appear in the face of Jesus Christ. You need a light when the Lord Jesus even himself and the power of God is making him known. You need a special capacity to be able to say it. Think of the two men on the way to Emmas. I I I I I I cannot get away from them and I will be touching on it maybe a little bit later on. But think of the two men on the way to Emmas. Did they know him? Oh, they knew him. They had eaten with him. They had done all these things. But they didn't know this one. Why? Because this was a few hours later. This was a few days later. You say, "Do you know God?" Oh yes, I know God. I can talk all about God. No, no, no. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the God who's trying to get near to you now &gt;&gt; at this moment in time. &gt;&gt; And I just simply want to say we need it. &gt;&gt; We need it. &gt;&gt; I don't want anything spiritually or supernaturally to happen and miss it &gt;&gt; unnecessarily. Miss it. I don't want to be so fogged in. I don't want to be so captured, captivated by the burdens and the weariesome of life. I don't want to do that and miss it. &gt;&gt; Miss the most important thing of life &gt;&gt; in the first it says in the face of Jesus Christ in the glory of God. Please just hang on to these words. Now I'm looking at you as a class in the first seal. First seal. Now it's not just a book. We're going to the first seal. That won't be the next night because it will be progressed to the second sale. Then it'll progress to the third seal and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth and the seventh. In the first seal, brother Brennan, he goes now as uh I want you to grasp as a prophet, as a messenger God maybe has sent to you if you accept that. And the messenger is saying now in John 12:23, he said, "Now listen here now real close." And you that perhaps don't understand my English real well, listen real close. He said, "Then you won't have to wonder no more what it is." And Jesus answering them, that's in the Bible, saying, "The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified." Speaking about him and Brother Brandham says, "See, you were at the end of an age there." His ministry is ending &gt;&gt; because he's soon going to be going to Calvary. He's soon going to be going to the cross. &gt;&gt; He's soon going to be silent. He's not going to say anything. He's not going to do any miracles. It's the end of an age. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; And things are changing. And people who know him so well won't know him in two or three days unless the light would shine on them and into their heart. And so it says you're at the end of the age. His ministry is ending. The hour is come. This is what Jesus said. The hour has come that the son of man should be glorified. He said, "What about the hour?" He breaks. What about the hour has come when his bride must be taken away? I say to this church in this congregation, what about the hour that comes when the bride shall be taken away? What about that hour? I I I may not know a lot about it, but I can tell you this. You don't want to miss it. I don't care what your prospects of the future are. I don't care how gifted you are. I don't care what kind of IQ you have. You don't want to miss this. I don't care how successful in business you are. You don't want to miss this. when the bride must be taken away. What he said that the hour has come that time shall be no more and the angel is ready to set his foot on the land and on the other and the other on the sea. He's in the first sail. He's going to move on to the next one now. and the rainbow over his head, the the covenant declaring clearly, I'm the covenant angel &gt;&gt; and with his and the rainbow over him with with feet and say, "Time has run out." And besides that, he raised his hand and swore that time should be no more when this happened. How perfect it is. And here's the words. A sworn affidavit &gt;&gt; to the church. It's an affidavit is like an oath that's made on top of an oath. It's a double shity. An affidavit is only good when you have a someone who can document it, who's authorized to document. If you if you make a certain document, say with your immigration or you make a certain document and you must declare these things are true and correct, they won't just accept your signature. They want an affidavit. So you go to someone who is authorized and accepted by the government. They stamp it affidavit. And I declare that this is true. Then they take the responsibility and the government accepts it. Now we have a man and there's all kinds of preachers, &gt;&gt; all kinds of religious ideas. What does this mean in Revelation? What does this mean over here? And we have all kinds of preachers perhaps that have preached on Malachi 4. Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet. But then you have one come and refer to that. And then and then you have this God who creates light. And you have a man stand here and say, "Don't you see that light over this person?" And begins to tell that person what it is that is the big question and the dilemma in their life and answers that question. That kind of God I can serve. &gt;&gt; That kind of God is worthy of your life. &gt;&gt; That kind of God is worthy of your worship. That kind of God is worthy for you to come to church on Sunday &gt;&gt; and give your time and give your full attention. &gt;&gt; That kind of God I can listen to. &gt;&gt; Not once, thousands of times. &gt;&gt; Friends, God, that God has made this world and this generation inexcusable. There won't weigh anyone that has an excuse. And then when it talks about the countenance, I just want to say something about the countenance. Father, the hour has come that you shall glorify. The hour has come that the son of man should be glorified. And now you have a messenger of the son of man sent to declare him to make him known to a people. Get me now? To make make him known to reveal him to a group of people and say, "Oh, but I love him." because you have a messenger that's sent to attract people out of all of the religious systems to make a wife a bride for this son of man. &gt;&gt; And you know Jesus said the hour has come that you'll glorify him. And the Bible says speaking the apostle Paul says the woman is the glory of the man and that is why she doesn't have her she has her hair head covered and that covering is her hair but the woman is the glory of the man. I had two police officers I was speaking to last week, mounted police, and I was talking to them and they just of themselves they began to speak about women and I they're just speaking about their business, their their work as police and they said the women are these are the words they said the women today are so brash So forward and they said especially 15y old to 17 that's their biggest problem. Women what what what what made them that way? &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't make them that way. &gt;&gt; The Bible gave them a tender spirit. &gt;&gt; The the Bible gave them the honor of motherhood. The Bible gave them the capacity to be compassionate. &gt;&gt; What made them so that even police officers say they're so brash so just you know what made them that way? I'll tell you what made them that way. I'm not wise, but darkness made them that way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not light. &gt;&gt; Not this kind of light I'm speaking about. Not this one who said, "I'm the light. &gt;&gt; If you follow me, &gt;&gt; you'll not walk in darkness anymore. The hour has come that the son of man should be glorified." And then the next verse, the next line is this. Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground, it dies and abides alone. But if it die, it brings forth much fruit. If it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He's talking about father the hour has come that the sun shall be glorified but if a seed if it doesn't except a corn of wheat fall into the ground he's talking about himself being glorified and now he goes through the death now please hang on to this I'm just getting into the meat of the subject now he's now what is talking about he's going to go to the death and he's going to be resurrected into another body beyond death and this is being glorified and the people who know him he has just had 5,000 or thousands of people and he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you brother Brandham says he wants us to be vampires he said what do you think of a doctor or a nurse, a medical person would think of that phrase. He didn't explain it. He just said it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said he said it to thin down his crowd. &gt;&gt; He said it with a purpose. &gt;&gt; And there may be things today, and I trust not that would thin down the crowd. &gt;&gt; I don't want to thin down the crowd. I pray that the light of the gospel will shine into your heart. in the face of Jesus Christ and you'll see that there's something more &gt;&gt; to the gospel of Jesus Christ than what the churches and I include this church. God help us that we never sink down and just become a a society and a club and a charity society. We're not that. This is the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is the lifechanging light. This is the light that exposes the darkness. &gt;&gt; It's lifech changing. &gt;&gt; And into the face of Jesus Christ. For the scripture says, you may wonder about this scripture when I said the woman is the glory of the man. It's 1 Corinthians 11:7. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head. For as much as he is in he is the image of and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. Now I'm I'm I'm just making a little shift here on the message turn on the light. And I didn't choose that uh message for that reason. Could we just dim the lights please a wee bit? Okay. Thank you. There come another time that the church should get away from its sins and that is unbelief. Brother Brandham doesn't speak of sins. He says sins are not you know your adultery and drinking and carousing and so on. Sins is unbelief and the rest are attributes of sin and be sanctified. And along came John Wesley a little Anglican man but he saw the light on the gospel. Something happened to him. He saw the light on the gospel &gt;&gt; and it was the Philadelphiaian age to come forth. He preached sanctification by the blood of Jesus Christ and nothing could stand in its light. He was considered a fanatic but he protested all the rest of them and shined forth the light because it was the light of the hour. &gt;&gt; God found a man, John Wesley, who could turn on the light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then came the Pentecostal brethren. &gt;&gt; They come back in their age to the restoration of the gifts of speaking in tongues, the gifts of healing and things to the church. I want to stop there and I want your keen attention for a moment. I lived through this era and I'm probably one of very few in this body of people and for you that are on the internet I want you to listen very close. I lived in this area era in this time when there's a huge outpouring and the prophet's ministry came uh rose in that time and you can find books on it if you want in the libraries and it becomes a piece of history and and uh professor David Edwin Harold of of uh the university in Alabama I believe it is I spoke with him and he said that uh of the the two great giants of this movement and the reason he was studying it because he was a professor of history. He was studying it because he realized that there was this whole religious movement that happened. He said about 1958 1948 to 1958 it had changed in his words were changed the face of America. And now here's this uh nation that's rising in its uh mil military power to become the supreme military power of the earth. It hadn't yet. It had just come out of the second world war. But it was rising in its power of economic world power and military world power, but also would have a voice from a prophet that would say the nation would become or was the prostitute of nations because it also had a Hollywood and it also had a corruption and immortality immorality within it that would rot it from the seed from the core. But the gifts, Brother Brandham wasn't the only the gifted one. There was all kinds of gifts, gifts of healing. There was a Jack Cole and a HW uh Richard H. Hall and and Tommy Osbbor and Tommy Hicks. I've been in both of their meetings. And or Roberts, who's been here to Vancouver and all over the world. and has a huge faith city in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And there was all of these great ministries, O Jaggers and WV Grant and on and on at Infinitum, all kinds of them. And when uh when William Brandham was one, but David Ed, Professor Herald says that the two giants were William Brandham and Oral Roberts. But they said William Brandham a a meek and a man of a small stature and very humble. They said, "But he became a prophet to a generation." &gt;&gt; That's what he said. True. &gt;&gt; So that's not what we said. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; As far as I know, he's not a believer of the message as such, but he's a good man. And I spent a day with him here. He flew up here because he was interested in some things that I had said about him. And uh but the mistake, the great error. Now friends, I will not be speaking this again. I don't expect the great error. This is to help you. The great error that was made and the reason why people have such a wrong impression of things is they thought that what William Brham was doing was a gift. &gt;&gt; One of the gifts &gt;&gt; and they missed it. And I can tell you I was on a razor's edge from missing it myself. Why? Because gifts were everywhere. &gt;&gt; I saw small people. I saw people you don't know and I don't know. I saw a man from California up here just on the across the Canadian border praying for people, Russian people. And they're praying for them. And the three young young people came up, teenagers, deaf and dumb, couldn't speak and couldn't hear. And he prayed for them. He's just a preacher. He prayed for them in the name of Jesus Christ. And they both spoke and could hear all three of them. &gt;&gt; Did I forget that? Could never forget that. &gt;&gt; But did I get that confused with this ministry? No. And and tapes. Who made tapes? Katherryn Kman made tapes. Or Roberts made tapes. Billy Graham made tapes. All kinds of people made tapes. Having tapes isn't isn't unusual. Michael, if you want to come or can come, it'll be fine. Most of you don't know what this is. For you that are over on this side, this is a tape recorder. &gt;&gt; Say that's a monster. No, this is a small one. This is the tape. Brother Benham's voice is on that tape. This is called the real to real. And my wife has was talking to some of you young ladies that are probably here and you may remember it. And she said re realtore tape. She said you know something about the real to real. They said what what's real to real? That is from this over here. You want to put this here, Michael? We'll just put this one on here. We don't have to thread it on. This is real to real. that is I could tell you things but maybe I shouldn't take the time but uh it it's interesting that this tape is the is the I may be considered kind of kind of offthe-wall but anyway at at the expense of being off the wall this tape is is a byproduct of oil. Oil in the Bible always speaks of the Holy Spirit. I'm not making that connection, but it's strange that God would allow a byproduct of oil to make a tape way back before the foundation of the world. He said, "I'll probably let man and civilization develop a tape because I want to record my voice on it." And you want to go into the science of this tape. If you go into the science of it, and this is many, many years ago, but when the tape is made, it it lays like a whole lot of little rods. On the tape, it just like a whole lot of rods, you know, little short pieces of rods going like that. That's that's the composition of the tape. And when the tape goes by the playing head because it has a recording head. And I I want to I want to say that you go to the last book of your Bible that's called Revelation. Revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But it's strange. It's It's hard to understand. And it goes past the recording head. John was the recorder. &gt;&gt; And when it goes by the And when this tape goes by the recording head, you're going to think I'm crazy, but I'm not. When it goes by the recording head, all those particles that come from a byproduct of oil, all those particles, they scramble into all kinds of forms that science calls symbols. &gt;&gt; You go into the seals book and you'll find the prophet says, "Well, they heard a thunder." Well, he said it was just in a symbol form, right? &gt;&gt; Revelation said he heard a thunder, &gt;&gt; but it was just a symbol. He said God symbolized it to the church &gt;&gt; for just a season &gt;&gt; and then when it goes past the play head &gt;&gt; when you put it into play mode and now it's going to play it. It unscramles the symbols. And so God in Luke 17:30, Jesus was standing there on earth. And this John who wrote Revelation or recorded Revelation was standing there. And Jesus is saying when you see the time come of Sodom in the world and when you see the time come of Noah where they plant and they build and they buy and they sell and you see all the immorality and perversion. Do you see it? &gt;&gt; Even thus &gt;&gt; shall it be when the son of man that was him was on earth. He says when the son of man is revealed, there will be a time when you see the uh the the the characteristics of Sodom and when you see the time of Noah once again worldwide. That'll be the day when the son of man is revealed. And then they have the spirit of Elijah once again on the earth, not to record the events, but to to to untangle the symbols. &gt;&gt; And when you take this tape and you play it past the play head, it unscramles the symbols so that all the particles lay back into line once again. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? Well, that's just for a little that's a bonus. &gt;&gt; You know why I said that? Because I know you wouldn't hear it anywhere else. &gt;&gt; You kids are in school, you're in high school, you're in graduation, you're in college. You'll never hear that in college. &gt;&gt; And you'll never hear it in in a Bible school. And you may never hear it in your classroom. Even though we have wonderful people such as brother Kim Dingwall and brother Norm Woods and Mr. T. Catch and thank God for the school, &gt;&gt; but also thank God for the church. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And he takes things in time. And now here's here, like I said, that was just a bonus because this is just the beginning. Are we all right for time? &gt;&gt; Brother Tom is going to Seattle and so I don't want to uh I don't want to overstep my time. But wasn't that simple? [Music] And God chose to commence to reveal the son of man. And it bypassed us. And they were recording these when I was your age. They were recording these. I didn't know they were recording them. I didn't know that God said, "I'll send another prophet and I will stand by him and I will confirm it's me speaking." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because I must have &gt;&gt; I must fulfill the scripture in the days. &gt;&gt; Listen to me folks, &gt;&gt; don't be distracted. In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; when he begin to sound, the mysteries of God should be finished as he declared it to his prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now in the last 60 years, churches like this have been made. Churches like this have been constructed. And the gospel has moved on another 60 years. And I can tell you that the church world has become very entertainment prone, &gt;&gt; very given over and become occupied with all kinds of education and all kinds of the the world has advanced so far that we've gone from this and there's you know how many there is. Who can tell me how many messages there are? Raise your hand. Hello. &gt;&gt; Yes, Sister Reena Wit. &gt;&gt; How many is she signing? &gt;&gt; 1183. &gt;&gt; 1183. Brother Tim Dodd confirms 1,183 real to reals that you don't know anything about. But what you do know something about is this is a chip. Anybody know what a chip is? Put your hand up. Oh, have we ever got a lot of intelligent people here? You know what a chip is? How many on this side? How many in the balcony knows what a chip is? Let me see your hands. Be honest. Good for you. Everything that's on 1,183 of these is on this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But now I'm coming in with the I'm coming in with the heavy. I'm coming in with the artillery. Now, this did not give any of you any revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This did not make you any wiser in the gospel. &gt;&gt; Satan, this is Satan's Eden. and all this development and all this wisdom and all of this sophisticated uh engineering of technology did not Satan didn't do that to reveal Jesus Christ to you. &gt;&gt; He's not interested in revealing Jesus Christ to you. &gt;&gt; He's interested in bringing you into darkness, &gt;&gt; into confusion. He's not interested in bringing Jesus Christ. But God said, I'll record it there. &gt;&gt; You didn't have the privilege of walking with Jesus Christ when he was here. He was lowly. He was the son of man. He said, "The son of man hath nowhere to lay his head. He had a garment that was a nice garment. And the soldiers, they gave lots out to get his garment. And Jesus spoke some very difficult things except we hate our life and disregard it sort of thing. If you don't follow me, you have no life. You have no life, friends. And we might have been there in the crowd as we're here today. I hope you don't walk out just now. But Jesus said, "Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. And no one understood that. &gt;&gt; And because no one understood it, the Bible says, and the prophet of God emphasizes, they all left. And there were 70 who were ordained to the ministry, called by him to the ministry, sent out by this son of man to the ministry, &gt;&gt; and they left. That's right. Don't be surprised when people leave. &gt;&gt; Don't be shocked when people have questions. &gt;&gt; They all had questions. &gt;&gt; Don't be surprised when you say, "Well, that's a different kind of a church. He's a different kind." He wasn't just a different kind of a preacher. He was God's son. Amen. &gt;&gt; On earth. &gt;&gt; And he owes we owe him everything. &gt;&gt; And the fact that the world could come to oh such a sophisticated and such a cultury cultural wonderful and so high in all of our ly dawn our music and our singing and our our sound system and uh all of those things. That's fine. Use it. Use it. Use it. But we have one purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And I had a man say something to me, my former partner. He was a Catholic man. He was in the fellowship room. He came here to brother Mike Hunt's funeral. He had had an had an aneurysm and from his office to the Vancouver hospital was 10 minutes. And when they rushed him to the hospital, I just learned yesterday from brother Ken Ordeal that he had a private secretary and the secretary in the next office heard a thump and and and Bob's door was open. So she walked into his office. Normally she wouldn't walk into his office. And she walked into his office and he was on the floor I guess. And they called 911, got him to hospital within about 10 minutes, the hospital said. and he told me that if I hadn't been near the hospital, I wouldn't have made it. I wouldn't have survived. And then he said this, "Here's a man who's a millionaire. Here's a man who's been very, very successful. Here's a man who works very hard, very diligently. Young man, just works very hard. He doesn't know anything about the clock. He throws the clock away. He's made all kinds of money." But he told me this right here in the fellowship room. He said, 'I have one purpose in life, and that's to enter the kingdom of God. A Catholic man, Brother Daniel, I have one purpose in life, that's to enter the kingdom of God. I'm a little broken because I have to admit I haven't had a believer say that to me. &gt;&gt; I have one purpose &gt;&gt; in life to enter the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And this Lord Jesus, this son of man, this one that I'm telling you has been revealed. I don't have to convince you. He did it himself. He has been revealed. Everything that's on all of these tapes is on this chip, but that's not what will reveal it to you. You have more access to it. It's more available to you, but that won't reveal it to you. And then God gives you ministry. God gives you men who've given their lives. Do you think they can't do anything but preach? They absolutely can. They have all kinds of offers, all kinds of things and all kinds of people that want them maybe to preach and and and those things are are are very attractive perhaps, but they give themselves to the gospel of Jesus Christ to the needs of the people so they can encourage it on. Listen, young people, when you come for counseling, you you should pray as brother brother Joe Waldner, not brother Joe, brother Mike Walder told me, "Brother Ed, I I seldom call you, but when I do, I pray before I come and I say, God, whatever comes out of that man's mouth, I will take that as you speaking to me." Let me tell you friends, I've been here a long time. There's a lot of folks even sitting here this congregation could have saved themselves a lot of trouble if they would have come first to the office of the pastor the office of the man of God the office to the ministers and to the word of God and taken what God said they have they got disc yeah they got disc &gt;&gt; have they got have have they got the reals I probably haven't got the real to reals and then every everything that's on 1183 tapes is in this in this box and now it's here in this and a person can hear it on their iPad iPod and iPad and whatever more. &gt;&gt; But if they took and realized that God sent a servant here on earth to catch to catch the symbol and to catch the secret and to catch the men mystery of Jesus Christ and reveal him to the people. What simplicity? If they would regard that, they'd save themselves a lot of trouble. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? Exactly. I want to conclude in just a few minutes. Brother Brandham had just said. Then along came the Pentecostal brother. They came back in their age of the restoration of the gifts. Restore back the gifts. This is speaking in tongues and the gifts of healing and the things to the church. But did he said, but did you realize we've moved on from that? He said, "We didn't we don't disregard that anymore than you do your youth. You you that are older, you've all been youth. We've all been children." &gt;&gt; I look on my boyhood days and and it's it's very different from many of you, but we we we we don't disregard that we were children. We enjoy that. &gt;&gt; But now we become men and women. &gt;&gt; Now we become married couples. Now we become fathers and mothers with responsibility and the weight and the duty. Now you realize that we've moved on from that and we are in a bride time. &gt;&gt; Would you accept that? &gt;&gt; We're in a bride time. The selecting time, &gt;&gt; friends. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is this where we're at? Is this what's happening? &gt;&gt; It's selecting time. &gt;&gt; Do do you believe what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; You folks back there, do you believe that? This is a selecting time, not my selection. God's selection. &gt;&gt; God's making the selection. &gt;&gt; God has sent a voice. &gt;&gt; And you have a big part of it yourself. You say, "I believe that. I don't understand it, but I believe it. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends from experience, that's exactly the place I came to. And I heard that prophet speaking. He just spoke about Malachi. He said when Malachi there's before the great and terrible day of the Lord and the his first coming was great. It's recorded in the Bible. And his second coming is dreadful because it's judgment. And &gt;&gt; my question today is where are we? &gt;&gt; Where are we? Is God bringing this world into judgment? Are we in almost movement into a tribulation period? I don't know. I wouldn't want to see much more violence than we see. people just blown to pieces and suicide bombers and all kinds of things. Oh well, we we can become accustomed to it. We become accustomed to it because we hear it every day. That doesn't mean that's the way it's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; But now I come down to something. If you think you've really been thinking, I want you to really think about this. Even thus shall it be when the Son of Man is revealed. I I about missed it when it was 1183 tapes and everybody around me was saying, "Oh, it's just a gift. It's God's gift." And isn't that wonderful? Yeah, it's wonderful. Praise the Lord. This is great. And then I begin to I had questions. Huge questions. Now I know you boys believe me and girls. But when you have a question and they go on year after year, is God one? I got this friend here. He says God's one. It's Jesus only. And it's only one. I got this one over here. And it's God's three is a father, son, and holy ghost. And we're not going to tribulation. Yes, we're going through a tribulation. And and I finally determined there's no absolute to the big questions of life. And then I saw these people, you know, get up and uh anointed of God and prophesy and speak in tongues and all kinds of gifts and praying for the sick and I've been prayed for myself and yet healed and only, oh, you got healed. So that shows we're right. Then I had a simple a man just in his jeans, a man by the name of William Brandham who I was scared of because I'd heard so many things. And he goes like this. This is a gift of William Brham, but this is not William Brham. And they have gifts. Gifts that have been given them of God, but it's not God. &gt;&gt; But when you hear the word of God, the word of God, are you listening? The word of God is God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus was the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why the word had to be recorded because it had to fulfill the scripture in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. And friends, God did a an extraordinary thing. He gave us more than he really needed to do, &gt;&gt; but it so that we'd have no excuse. &gt;&gt; He left it here to be registered and recorded and translated into other languages. You people that speak Chinese, thank God. And you people that speak in the African language, thank God. And we're going to Russia next Sunday. I'll be in Moscow. Brother Tim Dodd will be in Moscow. This is the first time my wife heard this for the first time at breakfast and you people are hearing it for the first time. This is the first time that the faith challenge report has been re has been translated into Russian language. So the people in Moscow and Russia will be able to have it. I say thank God. &gt;&gt; I have a lot to say friends and I'll try to say it as fast as possible. But you see this here when the son of man is revealed and now brother Brandham comes follow me very close now. This is my hardest time. Brother Brandham preached a message. And don't don't think that this is just a sermon. This is a message, the unveiling of God. &gt;&gt; And he said, "My subject this morning is to reveal and unveil that God." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now friends, &gt;&gt; I might not pay much attention to it if I as a preacher said that. But when I when I hear a man that the pillar of fire, the angel of the Lord stood beside year after year, year after year, month after month, whatever city, whether it was Bombay or Durban, South Africa or Johannesburg or or or Helsinki, Finland, and the boy was raised from the dead. And and when people hear about those great things, you know, friends, are you able to stay with me? &gt;&gt; I have things that I haven't preached here. I have testimonies of this message. I was in Helsinki in Finland and there's a small group, maybe no more than would be here, and most of the people were white hair like myself, older people. and the young man who was who was what they didn't even have a pastor and this church supported a young man called Matty Honadan who's now the voice of God representative for Finland and for that region and I said you are obviously the one that is that the people look to you arrange the meetings you take the place of the pastor I said but he said I can't he's a male nurse in a hospital about 150 km away. This church, this body of people and some of them are still here. We paid his salary to become a pastor in Helsinki, Finland. And he told me, he said, "A woman in a group here, went to visit in a senior citizen's home." Are you following me? You've never heard this before. You young people, listen very close. A woman in the group in Helseni went to a sen senior citizen's home and she's visiting an old lady and another woman who was visiting came to her and said, "Excuse me, it seems that I know you from someplace." And this sister said, "Well, I can't recognize you." Yes, but she said, "It seems that I know you." So, they begin to exchange stories. And are are you a Christian? This lady said, "Yes, yes, I I go to a little group over here." She said, "And you?" She said, "I go to a Pentecostal church." Oh, well, she said, "That's nice." And they just exchanged a few greetings. And and this woman says to her, "And and what kind of church do you go to?" She said, 'Well, we fellowship around uh uh the message that God sent through brother Brandham, William Brham. Oh, this lady said, "Do you know about William Brham?" She said, "Well, yes." She said, "Do you remember hearing about the boy that was killed and was raised from the dead?" "Oh, yes." She said, "Of course I remember." She said, "It was my husband that drove the car that killed the boy." How do you like that? I got that woman on the telephone. She spoke only Finnish and Brother Matty Honen interpreted for me and I wanted to go to her place to get her testimony. She lived about 150 kilometers out of Helseni. She was nervous to be before a camera. But you know there were two boys on the bicycle and one was hurt and unconscious. And the mother of that boy, brother Brandham told me she was at the bottom of the stairs when he would come down the platform. She would get a hold of him. Sir, sir, you you must raise up my boy. You must raise up my boy. you. The other boy was raised from the dead. You must raise up my boy. He said, "I I didn't do that. The Lord Jesus did that. God did that." No, no, no, no. She said, "You did it." He She said, "No, no. God did it." Brother Brandham told me now you fellas are able to listen to someone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've been there. I'm the only witness. And brother Brandham said to me, he said, "I was in my hotel room and I was looking out the window and I saw of a vase, a flower vase with two liies in it and one was bent over like that and one was standing up straight and nice." He said, "And while I looked at the two liies, the other one came up erect and stood with this one." He said, ' And I said, call the woman. &gt;&gt; And he called, they called the woman and he said, 'Your son shall live. &gt;&gt; That was more than just one of the gifts of healing. &gt;&gt; That was more than just seeing a vision. You understand this, fellas? That was more I'm telling you personally things I don't have to tell you, but I'm telling you, I'm taking the time. I'm taking the time of the of of the ministry of the word today to give you this kind of testimony. This testimony is true. &gt;&gt; I lived it. &gt;&gt; I heard it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I talked with the woman whose husband drove the car that killed the boy. I had a man who visited that boy became a policeman in the highway highways department of Finland and a man sat in my house up here on 180th Street who lived in my daughter's house lived in the basement for a time. His name was Nino Nylo or something. I just forget. And he brought out of his pocket. We invited him to our place for dinner. And he brought his billfold out. And he reached his billfold and got a little picture. And he said, "Do you do you know this picture?" And I said, "Yes, it's the boy that was raised from the dead. It's a picture you've all seen with his heavy head of hair and bangs across here like this. And that was the boy that was raised from the dead." He said, "I I just visited him in Finland. He's a policeman on the highways department. And I said, "Does he remember anything?" "No, he remembers nothing. He only knows." Well, you don't remember anything when you're dead. And he he he became a policeman. And he said, "Just tell the people when you go, just tell them I'm happy and I thank the Lord." Now, you know how close it is. Not many people have a minister that has talked to the woman whose husband drove the car that struck the bicycle. That's how close it is, friends. And we have here in Cloverdale, by the way, no excuse. &gt;&gt; No excuse but to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I come to a point you have to you have to uh burden be burdened with me. That is why I'm receiving so many calls. It's a burden. I'm not happy with it. I don't want to get on a plane and travel for 15 hours this next week. I'm 81 years old. I got an email this morning from a pastor down in Tennessee said, "We're so thankful you've been on my heart for weeks. I'm so thankful that God has kept you. We have to have a witness. And you are a witness. And God has given you strength and given you health. But friends, I'm calling on this church. Maybe you've never uttered my name in prayer. But before you go home and after you go home, you utter my name in prayer and say, "God bless brother and sister Biscuit with health. &gt;&gt; I need my wife. I need my health. I need my voice. And I'm giving it all to the gospel. And I've never been ashamed of this gospel of Jesus Christ. And I challenge you. Live your life to this gospel. Live your life for this message. And you'll never never you'll never regret what I say. I challenge you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And this now I'm going to close in a few minutes. This man, brother, brother Brandham, he's a Kentucky and just a ordinary person. But he's the only one that I've ever heard in all of my life that said, now I want you to listen very close. He come the first time as son of man. And then when the Holy Spirit came after his resurrection and the Holy Spirit came down on the church that was the Holy Spirit. God is the spirit. And Jesus said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you." Said he became son of God. said all he did was change his mask. We call it Easter. &gt;&gt; That is why Jesus was walking with those two men on the way to Emmas. He wanted them to know the mask has been changed. You're not where you were last week. &gt;&gt; I've changed. &gt;&gt; But they needed to know that he had changed. &gt;&gt; They needed to know where they were. That's why I'm preaching this morning. Where are we? &gt;&gt; And then in the unveiling of God, he said, I want to unveil that God to you. In the unveiling of God, he says, then between the son of God and there he's revealed as son of man. became a little breach. I've never said this before public, but I will say it now just because it's one of my personal thoughts. I've often wondered why Brother Brandham just before he comes to the opening of the seals, what seven angels just before the seals, there's a message that's called the breach. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the breach is the breach is a word that is like there's a gusting forth. There's a gushing forth. There's like an announcement. And in the breach, go to it when you go home. Go to the breach and you'll find in the breach. In the breach, the prophet will go to Boaz and Ruth. Boaz a kinsman redeemer, taking a gentile wife and bringing her into Israel by giving seed to her. And that seed is the beginning of the lineage of the kings. &gt;&gt; He's on his way to be the son of David. &gt;&gt; And that child was from Boaz and Ruth. That was uh not Jesse, but that was OED and then Jesse and then David. And Matthew 1:1 says, "This is the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of Abraham, the son of David." &gt;&gt; That would be that's what made David's throne everlasting from everlasting to everlasting. Are you following me or have I lost you? Are you okay? You following me? He's the son of David. And this now we have a messenger. It says now he comes in a breach. He comes as a son of man between the son of God. And now I'm loading it off on you. And the son of David. And he said he comes son of David to the Jews &gt;&gt; in the millennium. He will be the son of David. Right. &gt;&gt; This voice, most of you know nothing. I had to go into my closet and get these. You don't know anything about that. [Applause] It kind of just slipped us and passed us by. He said, "Well, I wasn't even living at that time. But you were living at this time. &gt;&gt; But this didn't give you the revelation either. You were living at this time. Where is it? &gt;&gt; Surely I didn't lose my chip. &gt;&gt; On the pulpit. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I can lose the chip, but I can't lose what's in here. So you lived in this time, but this won't give you the revelation. &gt;&gt; Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, they shall be filled. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you as a congregation, doesn't matter what name is on here or who you have as ministers, but Cloverdale Bible way has nothing to boast about. Not whatsoever. We cannot impart to you a revelation. But you give yourself and believe on him whom God hath sent, and you shall receive the revelation, and that revelation shall anchor you, and you will be acquainted with the son of man, and you'll you'll run into things as I have that you cannot explain entirely. I ask you, you say, "Well, what things can't you explain entirely?" Where are we at? Exactly. &gt;&gt; Where are we at? I'm so thankful for the grace of God that he reveals what's in that Bible &gt;&gt; and he reveals what's in the message and it's the same God because what he reveals is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; The son of man that's in the Bible. The son of David, that's in the Bible. the son of God. That's in the Bible. But to tie them together and to ask the question, where are we? &gt;&gt; Do we just live our lives and die like a bunch of animals and go to a grave? Or do we really have a purpose in life? I'm very very thankful for you and the young men and the young ladies for this congregation. I'm thankful for you. Do you know why we getting called? Brother John Andes is leaving on Thursday for Poland. Brother Greg Novakowski is already over there. Want to be in the meetings? Let me tell you something, friends. We've reached out for 40 years. Over 40 years, we've reached out to India, to Poland, to Norway, to Finland, to Russia, to China, all over the world. We've reached out to them. You need a tape. Do you need a book? Well, yes, we'll do whatever we can. And that is why they reach back in &gt;&gt; and we got a group of people. If we didn't have, I thought of you, Brother Norm, Wood, that just retired. a man that's just retired with a full pension and all these all these things. You think he wants to go off and maybe be in a boat and fish, but instead he gives himself to you young people who've been at the school in the high school to teach you things that we couldn't afford to give you a man that could teach that. We just couldn't afford it. We couldn't afford to have a person as brother Kim Dingwall to build that school. I've told him plainly in this church ought to tell him if God hadn't sent you here we wouldn't have that kind of school and here we have brother Tatch uh Mr. Tats to you a lot of you children that man took us such a discount in his income probably $100,000 less than he could make in the in the secular world to be at the school and to teach our children. I say God we thank you. Amen. &gt;&gt; God, how we thank you. And you people have given. You think that you just goes into a hole in the a hole and we just spend it someplace. No, it isn't. It is that it might go out and that we might send somebody and we might send a brother Murphy or send someone to China or pay for some Bibles. Whatever it is, I say to God be blessed and God bless this congregation and God bless this ministry because we we're doing something that only God could put it in our hearts to dol &gt;&gt; God bless you brother Matthew Redell &gt;&gt; and taking the witnessing and taking and organizing the the youth and not only youth but others and going to other cities and other camps and other places. I say even if one soul, this is what I've said, even if one soul comes, we're not looking for a great big sweep. Even if one soul comes, it's worth it. &gt;&gt; You're living a testimony. You speak a word to somebody. It doesn't have to be a whole sermon. You sisters live the message. &gt;&gt; Live. &gt;&gt; My wife gets disturbed. Says, "I haven't brought a soul." One of her this last week says, "I haven't brought a soul to Christ recently." I said, "You lived a message today. You're living a message today. I had such an opportunity to speak to those policemen." I said, "And she told them about the church and told them about the school and told them to go down to the school." Troubled men. They're policemen, but they're troubled. You know why they're troubled? Father, because they're having to deal with darkness &gt;&gt; and the effects of darkness &gt;&gt; and Satan wrecking lives, wrecking families. I feel sorry for them. I'm so thankful we can declare a gospel that is a positive gospel. There's nothing like this message, friends. How many will say amen for me? &gt;&gt; This is my whole message. I'm done. We've gone on from here. This church was built since these were made. This church was built while these were made. This church stood here while it went onto this and while the hub was made. If we didn't have people like brother Darren Hoffman, we wouldn't have the hub. That man gave himself to write a program. We wouldn't have anything going to China if it wasn't for our brother Murphy. Who sent these people here? &gt;&gt; Who put it in their heart &gt;&gt; to give their time? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who put it in their heart? &gt;&gt; I'm just saying things. I'm not saying things to pump anybody up. But I'm saying things I've thought of these three men that are right here. Said, "Well, yeah." Oh, well, Brother Tom, raise your son-in-law. Listen, I remember when he was in a cast to his hip &gt;&gt; for 20 months. &gt;&gt; Who wants to be in a cast for 20 months? &gt;&gt; Almost killed in an accident. and he said, "All I want to do," and we needed somebody to listen to the tapes and get a 27 minute segment so we could put it on the radio broadcast. That's what he did &gt;&gt; as a young man as a young man in his early 20s. That's what he did. Brother John Andy's came here as a 15year-old. Brother Ken Andes, his father is here and his mother. Brother Ken Andes was here many years ago and he called me. He said, "I'd like to have breakfast with you." We met right over here in uh Willowbrook Mall. We had breakfast. He said, "Brother Biscoll, I feel to leave my family here." What do you think about that? Do you remember that, Brother Kent? I said, "Well, I I really believe that a father should be with the children." Well, anyway, he said, "That's what I feel led to do." I said, "Okay, whatever he feels led to do." And Sister Andes and the children lived here just across the border without their daddy. That was a sacrifice &gt;&gt; for many months at a time while he was transcribing and and sister and is transcribing the messages off the tapes and sending them out of spoken word and then voice of God. 37 years. That's what I call people giving themselves. &gt;&gt; And then someone up in the up there doing the Chinese Bible. Why? Because we want to do the Bible. No, there was a need. &gt;&gt; So we have God brings somebody that gives themselves. &gt;&gt; Just give themselves to God. &gt;&gt; You know what it is, Jeremy, to give yourself? You just live your life. Say, "Well, there's something in here." I bless you. You I shook his hand for a purpose. You You know, even as young fellows, are you 14? I was 14 when a man laid his head on my back and said, "Make him a preacher." I didn't want to be a preacher. He said, "Be a preacher. God, make him a preacher." And I wept. We don't understand these things, friends. We don't understand it. There's nobody here that's not important. &gt;&gt; Every last soul Jesus Christ shed his last drops of blood for you, for you sisters, for you brothers, for you families, for you elderly elder ones. God gave himself, he b you think that I think this is a small thing. I I realize I'm talking to the purchase of the blood of God. God God created that blood that I'm going to shed that blood and I'm going to send my spirit. I'm going to call his people and I'm going to send my messenger. I'm going to send a voice and it'll attract people and I will I will select them. I will call this one. I will call that one. &gt;&gt; Brother Jason, your wife, call her while she's in a mall. And and do people agree with it? No. Our minds fight it and maybe our friends fight it and our emotions fight it, but yet we can't get away from it. God is pulling us. God is pulling us and he's pulling us straight into heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. If there's a little something in your heart, give yourself to it. When you go out these doors, I can't necessarily go with you, but I have one that can go with you. The Holy Spirit, the spirit of God, the son of God, the Holy Spirit. And I have I I have things friends in this message unveiling of God. He says, then he'll he'll then he'll become when I see everything here. It's all happened. This has all happened. This has all taken place and it's gone by. Whether we have meetings Sunday after Sunday, it happens anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. While we're sitting here singing our songs and having our specials, it's happening anyway. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you how God cares for a person. Brother Tim Dodd, he worked at the bank, Royal Bank of Canada. I had my wife's my wife's sister got saved up in Edmonton. Milco took her to brother Harold Hillbrand's and she gave her heart to Christ. Just simple came and gave her life to Christ. Brother Mila, that's why you were with the airlines so he could call her and arrange to meet her and she gave her life to Christ. We weren't there. Sister Biscll, hey, you young ladies, you think life is difficult to shake hands with Sister Biscll after the service. She prayed and lived as a girl, younger than you, Jack. She lived as a girl and went to church 37 years and never saw anybody of her family come. And now God arranges for somebody to be on the airlines and her a thousand kilometers away and she comes to Edmonton and he meets her in Edmonton, takes her to church, she gives her life to Christ, everything changes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And her mom is 82 years old. Was 82 was here in a log church and she hears the message. I baptized hermen. &gt;&gt; My wife. That's the first people she saw in her family. &gt;&gt; After 37 years of being a girl, &gt;&gt; she didn't have to become my wife. &gt;&gt; I lived on the other side of the street. I was the vagabond. I was a drifter. I was the uneducated. Her daddy was successful businessman. Her daddy was asked to be mayor of the city. And when I first talked to him, he said maybe she wants to travel. She could travel, but she wanted to be in church. to this very day. It's one of the problems I have. Sometimes I'm too weary. Sometimes I have to study. But she wants to come to church. She wants to sit where she's sitting. I baptized her mom at 82 years old. You want to ask yourself, am I prepared to live for Christ? Am I prepared to live before my family? I don't have any encouragement at home. I don't have a mother that's saved. I don't have a father saved. In fact, as my home is broken, my mother's 2,000 kilometers away. &gt;&gt; But God had ordained that she be part of this message, part of the bride. And on the way to be his bride, she become my bride. Friends, that's okay. &gt;&gt; Shake hands with her after the service. She's held true to this message. And I'm challenging you now. You hold true to this message. &gt;&gt; It's worth every ounce of your strength. &gt;&gt; If anybody has any question about any testimony I've given here, I'll be happy to give you give you that testimony and give you more. &gt;&gt; I can tell you as a witness and I got an email this morning from a pastor in Tennessee. He says, "I'm so thankful God has preserved you as one of the witnesses of this message." and you have strength. I text him right back. I'm just on my way to church. I'm going to preach on the light, the son of man light. And friends, that's why you have some order to your life. That's why we have some order to this church. Not because we have anything to ourselves, but that the light of the gospel has shone upon us. And I have identified it. You have identified it. We recognize it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we give ourselves to it. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Brother Nathan, I'd like you to join me in the song. We'll walk in the light, the beautiful light. Would you like to stand? Bow your head with me in prayer. If you feel to raise your hand and say, "Brother Biscll, I need prayer.

After a sermon like that, all you can say is, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; You ought to leave the place this morning just saying, "Thank you, Lord." Thank you, Lord, for that message. Thank you, Lord, for brother Biscll unburdening his heart. Thank you, Lord, for leaving us a witness. A witness of what has happened in this generation. Thank you, Lord, that I can be a part of what you're doing here in Cloverdale Bible Way. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's bow our heads together in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you. We praise you. We exalt the name of Jesus Christ, that name above every name. Lord, man cannot put together these events that have unfolded in these last days. And you've allowed it to unfold right down to the present time that we're living in. And even as brother Biscll has said, Lord, do we really understand the time that we are living in, oh God? Lord, I pray that you'll take the word that was spoken this morning through your servant. And Lord, may you anoint it to each one of our hearts. May we ponder it, Lord. May we not just leave here saying it was a nice message and a nice service, but may we leave here in the power of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ. that as we go from this place that the word would resonate within our hearts, giving us what we have need of. Oh Lord, you truly have ministered to us. Lord, we could say as the scripture said, our hearts burned within us as you spoke to us this morning. And go with us now as we refresh these mortal bodies with uh refreshment and relaxation this afternoon before the evening service. May you bless each one that's able to make it back tonight to hear your word once again. We commit ourselves to you. We commit brother Biscll to you, Lord. Strengthen him, Lord. He's committed himself to travel and at his age, it's not easy, Lord. May you pour in virtue, God. Strengthen him for the meetings ahead. We commit all to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. and shake hands with one another as you go. God bless you. The service is dismissed until the evening service at 5:00. Amen. [Music] Oh, heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
