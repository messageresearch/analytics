[0:00] the revelation of St John the Divine
[0:02] chapter 22 and he showed me a pure River
[0:06] of Water of Life clear as Crystal
[0:08] proceeding out of the Throne of God and
[0:10] of the lamb in the midst of the street
[0:13] of it and on either side of the river
[0:15] was there the Tree of Life which bear 12
[0:18] manner of fruits and yielded her fruit
[0:20] every month and the leaves of the tree
[0:22] were for the healing of the Nations and
[0:24] there shall be no more curse but the
[0:26] Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be
[0:28] in it and his servants Shall Serve him
[0:31] and they shall see his face and his name
[0:33] shall be in their foreheads and there
[0:35] shall be no night there and they need no
[0:37] candle NE the light of the Sun for the
[0:40] Lord God giveth them light and they
[0:42] shall reign forever and ever and he said
[0:44] unto me these sayings are faithful and
[0:47] true and the Lord God of the Holy
[0:49] prophets sent his Angel to show unto his
[0:51] servants the things which must shortly
[0:53] be done behold I come quickly blessed is
[0:57] he that keepeth the sayings of the
[0:58] prophecy of this book
[1:00] and I John saw these things and heard
[1:02] them and when I had heard and seen I
[1:05] fell down to worship before the feet of
[1:07] the Angel which showed me these things
[1:09] then saith he unto me see thou do it not
[1:12] for I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:15] Brethren the prophets and of them which
[1:17] keep the sayings of this book worship
[1:19] God and he saith unto me seal not the
[1:22] sayings of the prophecy of this book for
[1:25] the time is at hand he that is unjust
[1:28] let him be unjust still and he which is
[1:30] filthy let him be filthy still and he
[1:33] that is righteous let him be righteous
[1:35] still and he that is Holy let him be
[1:38] holy still and behold I come quickly and
[1:42] my reward is with me to give every man
[1:44] according as his work shall be I am
[1:47] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:49] end the first and the last blessed are
[1:52] they that do his Commandments that they
[1:54] may have right to the tree of life and
[1:56] may enter and through the gates into the
[1:58] city for without our are dogs and
[2:00] Sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers
[2:04] and idolators and whosoever loveth and
[2:06] maketh a lie I Jesus have sent mine
[2:09] Angel to testify unto you these things
[2:11] in the churches I am the root and The
[2:13] Offspring of David and the bright and
[2:15] morning star and the spirit and the
[2:17] bride say come and let him that heareth
[2:21] say come and let him that is a thirst
[2:23] come and whosoever will let him take the
[2:27] Water of Life freely for I testify unto
[2:29] every man that heareth the words of the
[2:31] prophecy of this book If any man shall
[2:34] add unto these things God shall add unto
[2:36] him the plagues that are written in this
[2:38] book and if any man shall take away from
[2:40] the words of the book of this prophecy
[2:43] God shall take away his part out of the
[2:45] book of life and out of the holy city
[2:47] and from the things which are written in
[2:49] this book he which testifieth these
[2:52] things saith surely I come quickly amen
[2:55] even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our
[2:59] Lord Lord Jesus Christ be with you all
[3:02] amen
