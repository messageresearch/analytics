Lord, you're found in the praises of your people where two or three would gather. Lord, it's not just words that are written on the page of a book, but it is your mind expressed down to us, Lord, to give us the confidence, Lord, to allow faith to rise up in our souls this morning, to take you at your word. We have gathered this morning not looking to man but looking to you the God of our salvation Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Elohim. [Music] [Applause] How we long. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hell. [Music] Oh, [Music] how we long to worship you. Hallelujah. Amen. I asked brother David Adamore to come and just lead us in prayer this morning. We have couple of requests to make known. I look down and I see the Ricardo family is together this morning for the Ricardo and Sister Buffy and family. May God bless you. Brother Ricardo wants to ask for prayer for the daughter of his boss at work. He's going into surgery to remove a growth on the brain on Monday. Just ask that the Lord would touch her life. There's a John and Rita Simmons. Rachel Simmons is asking request on their behalf. Uh vehicle Thursday morning hit the side of the house asking for prayer for the family. The father is very distraught asking that he would touch their lives this morning. Sister Ronda Redell has a thanksgiving to express to the congregation for everyone for their prayers and support. All of those who brought food and flowers. May the Lord richly bless you. Most of all, I just want to thank the Lord for always being so faithful to be right by your side, holding your hand every step of the way to carry you through with his peace. All glory and praise be to God. Thank you for bringing back that report, Sister Rhonda. Amen. I think that's the true heart of every believer is to be the one out of the 10 lepers that got released. You know, when you have leprosy, you're not allowed to fellowship. You're not allowed to go over to company's house, sit down and have a meal together. You can't come to church when you have an affliction. But when Jesus came and set them free, they could go about normal activities once again. &gt;&gt; But only one found it in their heart to come back. And I think that's the heart of every believer is to come back and give thanks to the Lord &gt;&gt; when he delivers us out of each one of our situations. Amen. Brother David, why don't you come and lead us in prayer this morning? If you have a need upon your heart or you just want to thank the Lord for something that he has done, the house of the Lord is full this morning. It's good to see the saints from Seattle. Brother Machmood, brother Peter I saw just a moment ago and the different ones, Brother Oed, Brother Israel and your families. Brother Solomon, God bless you. This is a great great house of worship. May you just be free in the Holy Spirit this morning to worship God. Brother David, let's just bow our heads and our hearts. &gt;&gt; Our dear heavenly father, we we worship you this morning, oh God. Father, it's a privilege, Lord, to stand with brethren of like, precious faith &gt;&gt; that Lord, we can gather together like this, Lord, and know that we have one common goal, Lord Jesus, and that's to see you glorified, oh God. Father, we we start with thanksgiving, Lord Jesus. We thank you, oh God, for good health, Lord. We thank you for the salvation, oh God, that you brought to us, oh God. We thank you for the Holy Spirit, Lord. We thank you for your salvation, Father. Father, we know, oh God, without you, Lord, we can do nothing. We know, oh God, that we're just mortals, Lord. Father, vessels of clay, Lord. Father, as a microphone, as it were, but Lord, it's your spirit that makes a difference, Lord. how we're reminded of the service once again, Lord, when Jesus came. &gt;&gt; And Father, it's when you came, Lord, that you made the difference, Lord. And we thank you, oh God, that you've considered us this morning to come in our midst, not only, Lord Jesus, in healing Sister Rhonda, Lord, but Father, in the breaking of the bread of life, Lord Jesus. Father, we thank you, oh God, for the healing of the body, not just spiritually, Lord, but physically, Lord God. And father, with these thanksgiving, we come with faith in our hearts, knowing that you can meet every need, Lord, for this little one who's going for surgery, Lord Jesus. Father, you're the one that created the brain, Lord. You're the one that created the heart. You're the one that created the body, Lord Jesus. And Father, when we come, oh God, with faith in our hearts, Lord, we know that everything is possible, oh Lord God. Because, Father, you said whatsoever we can believe for, we can have it, Lord. So, Father, we lay our hands by faith upon these requests, oh God, asking that you would you would touch this young lady, Lord. Father, if it be your will to go through this surgery, Lord, we pray you'd give the physicians, oh God, the wisdom, direct their hands, oh God. Father, may they be precise, Lord Jesus. And may this little one turn around to give glory to you, Lord. Father, for this family, Lord, who had the the vehicle on the side of the house, Lord Jesus, the husband, Father, the house is distraught. Father, you're the great comforter, oh God. Father, if he does not have the peace of Jesus Christ, we ask, oh God, that you would go to him where even now, Lord, that you, oh God, will supply his every need, Lord, you would keep him in composure, Lord. You will keep his mind, oh God, at peace. You keep his heart, oh God, at peace, Lord. But most of all, Lord, may he look up to you. May he, oh God, recognize that it's your grace, oh Lord, that has sustained him to this time, Lord. Father, Lord Jesus, for I believe um the brother, oh God, I don't remember the name just now, but God, I just all the needs, all the requests that were made, Lord, we we bring it before you, Lord Jesus. Father, it's upon my heart also to give thanksgiving to to you, Father, for Brother Ed's granddaughter, Lord, the special report that has come back, Lord. Father, I I rejoice, Lord, with with the brethren, oh God, that Father, you have found it in your heart, Lord, to touch this little one, Lord. Thank you for the doctor's report, Father. Thank you, dear God, for the faith of the believers, Lord, to continue to hold on. But, Father, it's in my heart, Lord, because the work is not completely done yet. Father, I want to see her, oh God, walking perfectly. I want to see her, oh God, free from every aid, Lord. But, Father, giving you praise, Lord, and rejoicing, Lord Jesus. That's my heart desire, Lord. And I make it known to you as I'm sure, oh God, is all of our hearts desires, Lord. Father, we have many things to be thankful for, oh God. Father, as the word of life would come even this morning, Lord Jesus. Father, there many in this congregation, Lord, who are not saved, Lord, many who might not be filled with the Holy Spirit, Lord. Many, oh God, who are here, Lord Jesus, or are not even here, Lord. Father, we pray that the bread of life will be broken to each member. That your Holy Spirit, oh God, would reach out, Lord, to each lost soul, Lord. And father in your own special way God that you would deliver that you power this morning &gt;&gt; God almighty that you deliver Lord [Music] &gt;&gt; have your own way &gt;&gt; God you said in your word &gt;&gt; that it's not your will that any should perish Lord. &gt;&gt; And oh God, I pray that you deliver this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, I remember my brother Daniel. Lord, [Music] &gt;&gt; have mercy this morning. and your power. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't have confidence in any man, Lord, &gt;&gt; but I pray you would anoint the man behind this pulpit this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God, it's a blessed time to walk with you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Pray you give the man of God the words to speak. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to speak many words, God. But if he can only speak one, God, just the way you got a hold of my heart. She can only speak one word, God. &gt;&gt; Father, but I'm confident, Lord, that you do all things well. &gt;&gt; Thank you for my family, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for all the families that are represented here. Oh God, &gt;&gt; thank you for the families of God. Lord, Father, I know also Brother Tony had a request. And father, I don't know if we can speak it over the pulpit, Lord, but you've done it before, Lord. &gt;&gt; We pray, God, not. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, Lord, not just spiritually, but also physically, Lord. Yes, &gt;&gt; but God, we stand this day with faith in our hearts, Lord, because we're confident in you, Lord, &gt;&gt; that you who have called us, Lord Jesus, you're more than able to take us all the way, God. &gt;&gt; And so we thank you, dear God. We thank you, Lord, as we would hear your word, Lord. Let there be liberty. Let there be freedom. as was prayed earlier on. Lord Jesus, God Almighty, I pray Lord, let your word have its way in our hearts, let us not just be hearers only God, but let us, Lord, be doers. Let your Holy Spirit work through us, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for everything. Father, be magnified and glorified in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [Music] In prisoners chains [Music] with pleading stripes, tall and silence, how they prayed that night and in their pain they began And to see [Music] &gt;&gt; our God's a delivering God. &gt;&gt; Hey, we're free.

You may have your seats this morning. God bless you. Sister Rebecca from Ohio, Brother Jeff Jenkins Church. Is she here this morning? Okay, there you are. I'm sorry. I'm looking for you back there. If you want to come and get ready, she's going to sing a special for us this morning. So, just while she comes, I've got a quick announcement. Um, in regards to winter camp, the forms are back on the tithe box back in the back. For those wishing to be counselors, please fill out the forms as soon as you possibly can and turn those in just as quick as you can. And they'll be trying very diligently to include as many as uh as they can for winter camp. That's March 11th through the 14th. So, just a few short days away to get ready for camp. And there's also going to be a benefit uh being held in Rutherford at Brother Joseph Green's church. So if anybody is going to be in Rutherford, North Carolina uh around February 13th time frame, you might want to check the back bulletin board. We'll put this announcement back there for you. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; May the church say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. &gt;&gt; God bless y'all. Um, I would just like to say it's been such a blessing to be here sojouring with you for a few weeks. Um, I felt such a welcoming spirit here and your many expressions of love and I want to thank everyone um, for making us feel so welcomed. Um, I would just like to give a little testimony before I sing this song if that's okay. Um, I was in a speech class in college, um, back in 2005 and we had an assignment to write a poem and I began writing the poem and I wrote the first four lines of it and um, I I wasn't serving the Lord at the time and I we were supposed to write a poem about something that really meant a lot to us and um, of course that was the Lord to me, you know, even though I wasn't I was running from Um, and so I'm sorry. Um, so I I began writing the poem. I wrote the first four lines and then I wasn't able to complete it because I wanted to end it on a positive note and I wasn't able to do that without having the experience of the Lord in my life. And so um, a couple months after that course, the Lord got a hold of my life. I finally surrendered. And uh and then about a year and a half after surrendering my life, I was praying one day. I had my my brother was very burdened on my heart and I began to pray for him and it was just such a special time of prayer. Uh I was just really beside myself and and it it was just such a blessing and it during prayer um the Lord spoke to me and said, "Get up and finish the poem." And I just thought it was a distracting thought and I kind of tossed it aside. I was just, you know, I just I was like, why would I have that thought while I'm while I'm sitting here praying, you know, but then the urge came on so strong and uh to to where I picked myself up and and I just went over to search for the beginning of the poem that I had started and um and the Lord just gave me the lines. It just flowed. He he just completed the whole thing. And and I'm just so thankful to have my brother here with me today. He's here visiting and it's just such a blessing. Um and so I also um am just very thankful um you know to be able to be here myself and and this poem that the Lord has given um he's been really dealing with me in song lately. So I'm going to try and sing it by the grace of God. So just please pray for me. God bless you all. [Music] There's a yearning deep down inside of my heart. Something is missing and I'm falling aart. The curtains are closing and the time is near. I should be rejoicing, but instead I'm in fear. I know there was a promise that was made long ago, but the cares of this world have brought me so low. I feel trapped down here now with no way to get out. If only I could understand what the cross is all about. A sense of urgency sweeps over me. And deaths at my door. Jesus Christ then comes to mind. And my knees soon hit the floor. In desperation I cry out. Sing. There's nothing I can do. He seems so distant from me. Will I be able to break through? I have heard about his love and how he sets the captive free. But all the sin that I live in, how could it be for me? And suddenly he reminds me and I begin to see. He paid the price so long ago on a hill called Calvary. I then ask him for forgiveness for all my unbelie. [Music] Just like a mighty rushing wind, he quickly sends relief. Something inside of me responds and reality sets in. I wasn't meant to live this life a slave in bondage to sin. I cannot begin to explain it. But her death has taken place. New life has sprung up in me. The joy is written all over my face. What seemed to be impossible has just been made so clear. All this time I have been running as he has tried to draw more near. This is just the beginning of our journey through this land. I am hanging on to his promise as we walk together hand in hand. I know I will make many mistakes and many times I will fall down, but by his grace I'll get back up. I'm predestined to receive a crown. I've been made an overcomer by his mercy and his grace. Thank God for authority to put the devil in his place. Satan has no more dominion over this tabernacle of clay. But my maker will attend it with care each and every day. I am thankful beyond words for the love he shares with me. I see him in my brothers and sisters which brings true unity. I am thankful for his keeping path which gives eternal security. I will praise his wonderful holy name throughout eternity. Yes, I will praise his wonderful holy name throughout eternity. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to welcome I didn't catch your brother's name. &gt;&gt; Michael. &gt;&gt; Michael. God bless you, Michael. It's good to have you here. Let's give Michael a hand. [Music] Amen. Oh, it's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's good to hear the testimonies &gt;&gt; of the redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And why don't we stand this morning? We'll give the Lord a hand clap of praise. He is worthy. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. Something's making me feel awful relaxed. I don't know what it is. Maybe you better turn around and shake hands with somebody. Tell them, "Welcome to the house of the Lord this morning." &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why don't we sing the word is working on me. Do you know that, Elena? We're going to invite our pastor to come take his liberty this morning. We have a communion service this evening, footwashing at 4:00. Remember that 4:00, we'll have communion footwashing. The service will start right away at 4:00. So, make sure that you're here and get a good seat this for this evening's service. Brother John will be ministering. I know it's going to be a wonderful day today. Amen. So, as our pastor comes, why don't we sing this together? The word is working mightily in me. The word is working mightily. Oh, in me. No matter what the circumstance or what I feel or see, the word is working mightily in me. The word is working. Praise God. The word is working finally. [Music] No matter what the circumstance or what I feel or see, the word is working finally in me. Well, the word is working. Oh, in me. The word is working in me. No matter what the circumstance, [Music] &gt;&gt; I agree. God bless you. Yeah. Just have your seats for uh a while, would you please? While I I have uh a number of important announcements to make and uh to speak with you about some of these things. very very happy for all that are here. all who are forming part of the congregation that we don't see the invisible congregation last Sunday I don't always check on this but last Sunday uh there was 177 locations that were streaming and some of those are groups and some of those are families and some of those might be one but 177 locations so it' probably be somewhere around 400 people that are right today joining with you and many many have been streaming for years. They stream every service. And so we just want to say to them, God bless them. God bless you. &gt;&gt; And God bless us together. &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul said, we're one bread. And so that's God's choosing. I have a number of announcements. So I just want to uh follow those closely. Uh the communion service which brother Derek has already announced at 4:00 this afternoon, but there are those from Seattle, Tacoma, and perhaps other places that have uh come to be with us today. And so I would just like to if you are here and you have driven h you are not going to be going home obviously and uh those on the US side uh those of you that are not going home and you are going to be remaining uh it won't be that long between the services but if you don't have a place to go and you're free this afternoon I'd like to know how many I'd like to see how many I say we're not going home and we're going to be remaining here uh until the afternoon service, but you don't have a place to go. I'd like to have you raise your hand so the rest of the congregation could see. Why don't you raise your hand? All right. Uh Sister Shannon and brother Terry Schmouth. Uh and over here, please just hold your hand up so everyone can see. All right, that's brother Matt Desmet upstairs balcony. My most of the people are taken care of. But you that are that are here and uh part of the congregation and are local, you you see these hands and those who are here, it would be just grand to invite them, have them over, put another cup of water in the soup. It'll still probably be nourishing or in the stew or whatever. You can always do some imaginative things. I read about uh a a young man in a Jewish family in New York and they were very very poor, very poor. And he wrote in his wasn't in his memoirs but in his articles cuz he was a journalist of some kind. And uh I thought it was so typical. It was uh just so typical. And so if they were having guests over, they didn't have enough food. Mother didn't have enough food. So, she'd say to the children, "Now, don't you dare uh don't you dare take vegetables because we haven't got enough to go around." So, the kids, they pass the vegetables up. "No, I don't want any. I don't want any." So, when it came to the dessert, she'd say, "Now, you kids didn't eat your vegetables, so you don't get any dessert." And that's how she made it enough to go around. So, whatever you folks have to do to make it go around, just make sure everybody here is welcome and has a and has a a place to go and put their feet up and have a bite to eat, and God will bless you. It's wonderful. It's really wonderful to be able to do that. Uh, this Friday, we're having also a prayer meeting, but we've been inviting the young people. Normally be a young people's meeting. It won't be a young people's meeting in that sense, but we want to be able to combine it. So, they are welcome. It'll be a prayer service. Brother Don Alexander, he takes charge of the prayer service, but we also will be h having perhaps a testimony and and we'll speak together about that, Brother Dawn. uh because we just want to make it so that uh families come and those of you that have come, we've heard such good reports and this last Friday we weren't able to be here uh to the service, but we heard some very wonderful reports from it. So, you are invited to that. Brother Derek spoke of the uh winter youth camp, but I want to just say a little bit more about it. You know, friends, these aren't just events. These are spiritual things, spiritual events. We're not doing it to have an event. We're not doing it for any entertainment. That's not why we put all this effort forward. We do that because some of you that are sitting here, God moved on you in a very real way in some of those meetings, camp meetings, wherever they were over the last 20 or 21 years. And we probably there's probably been maybe 200 or more that have been baptized as a result. And sometimes it's months later that a young person &gt;&gt; and believe me I believe in that. &gt;&gt; I was young once, believe it or not. And I remember clear crystal clear what God did for me as a youth. And I would not trade those moments for all the money or gold in the world. Those are eternal moments and we want to create that atmosphere. I think it's wonderful to be able to create an atmosphere and have a place where people's minds can be so solely on Christ and on eternal things. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; So that's what this is all about. The speaker will be brother Kedri Diggs. Brother Tom and he shared a a special meetings together. And so those that are streaming that this is your church and you pay tithes here. Some many people who are in the local area who may be in the Okonogan up in the uh valley down in the Tri Cities or over in Idaho. We had a phone call from uh uh uh sister uh brother Lane and Athena his wife and they wanted she just so urgent. I want my young people to be in that meeting and they stream all the time. They're part of the congregation by streaming. You don't see them but these eyes these eyes register very little compared to what God is doing. And so by all means we want to let them know that uh those are welcome to come and it'll be on a first come first serve basis however many were able to handle on in August first week of August is going to be a family camp and brother Ron Spencer will be the speaker &gt;&gt; and we're so happy that he was free and able to come and wanted to come. And I'm sure we want him to come. He and his wife, Sister Connie, we expect them to be here. And I asked him to try to persuade his father. We've tried to get Sister Conniey's father and mother to come. And if they are able to come at some time, uh you will you'll never forget them. I tell you that brother Frasier when the Lord made him, he threw the pattern past Pluto. I'm sure because you'll never never see another person quite like him. And uh brother Charlie Spencer, I don't know whether he and his wife can come, but brother Ron has asked us to pray especially for brother Frasier, sister Conniey's dad, because he's having he's had just had an operation on his sinuses and so on. And this man's a fighter. This man's a old warrior. I mean, he he fell out of a tree and broke up all the bones in his body. He's got more wires and rods in his back and all of these things. And they thought he'd never walk again. Hey, he's up doing everything that anyone else can do. And if you to see him walk in here, you wouldn't think anything's wrong with him. He just uh a real determined. I like to see people that are real fighters like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you don't have to be an older person to do that. Uh you might even want a pencil to jot some of these things down. Brother Richard Dioa uh he is emailed he was planning to be here in January. We sent invitations letter invitation letters so they get a visa and he wasn't able to come and the reason why he's not been able to come the first time he couldn't get a visa quick enough he wasn't able he had to go down to South Africa to get it the second time they have bought a a a piece of property that is five hectares now the place that they have right now I think is about seven hectares where they have Shikina publications and all the translation buildings and things and it's a it's a wonderful work just a wonderful work and uh we have been there on several occasions we were I was there for the dedication several were here from here were over there for the dedication of uh Shakina publications uh property and but they don't have a church the church is on our boulevard further into the city but it's too small and I've been there several times you don't even see the whole congregation. The church seats probably 8 to 10,000 people and they the last time we were there they tore the whole wall out and had about a thousand men working for a week tore the wall out and extended it by onethird and now it's too small. So, they have purchased this 5 hectare uh piece of property and have the materials to put up a steel building, but he's been very uh burdened with that. So, let's pray for him. He's a small man with a big heart and a big vision, and God has really used brother Dioa, and I I would like to just even just have him here to show friendship and to strengthen him. And let me tell you, we don't have enough time in the day to tell you how the enemy fights against a man like that. &gt;&gt; So, you're spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can just know that Satan has far more demon powers and spirits that's waring against him than he even has in his congregation. He's got he's got just hordes of spirits and demons that would fight him and every turn of the road. And it is the children of faith &gt;&gt; and the men of God &gt;&gt; that declare the word of God &gt;&gt; and and will absolutely will not bend &gt;&gt; to the enemy. &gt;&gt; And so we want to show our support. It's not a visit, friends. It's not just a somebody to come and visit and speak. That's not why he's he's coming. He just wants to be uh with you again and with the congregation and and uh perhaps speak of uh what God is doing out of out of his heart or in his heart. And I just say God bless our brother Dioa. And we're going to attempt to have him here in February. We sending just sent out invitational letters now. I've been in contact, direct contact with uh a brother in Haiti. He's he's an elder brother in the church that has 2,000 members. And uh he has told me now that of the number of people uh there was 12 in that congregation that lost their lives. And he just puts it different. He said uh now in the all the tally of the I think that not all the churches necessarily in Haiti because I haven't got uh contact with all of them but there's he said we have 18 believers that have gone to be with the Lord and uh uh so they're not sad about that but they just wanted us to know that they said that the immediate need was for food and for water and then uh brother John had uh sent this from taken from brother Pat's website but we also have had contact and uh brother Pati is over there and they have formed I'll just read a little bit of this they have formed a distribution committee with the pastors and leaders of the churches from Porta Prince and two other areas two other cities and there are uh 4,500 brothers and sisters gathered in those three areas alone alone. And although the international help is now starting to be available, violence is all too often a part of it such that the brethren shy away from it. So the needs are so great that all the funds could be used up just in order to cover very basic food and water requirements. And incidentally, the church here and you people gave an offering. some that are streaming gave uh and sent offerings in and nice offerings. So, we have sent $8,000 uh to brother Pat's account uh so that he could take those funds and have them down there to meet the immediate need. So this committee has they determined that they would take a first installment of uh $5700 and buy uh by the immediate things that are essential to cover the essential needs and uh this was combined with Jeffersonville donations as well. People have given from all over. They even gave from Europe. And brother brother Pat very precise that he has an account and from that account is he's very accountable and food and and water are the first things and then they will have needs. I asked a brother about clothing in my email and he said we will need clothing because the people have lost everything everything. They don't have homes to go to. Many of them are living even at the church or in tents or just under tarps or whatever they have and they just have the clothing that they had on their backs. So, I'm not only asking this congregation, but those that are streaming and to tell anyone else uh if you wish to uh don't give parkas or wool garments, but this is a fairly hot climate, but you could bring uh appropriate clothing. I've spoken with brother Richard Drake and uh although he cannot do the work so I'm I'll come to a second part of that but he will be the point man and uh uh what we want to do is be able to collect clothing and be able to send it to those people. So we will need secondly we'll need workers and those that are able or would like to put in a little bit of time or just help in some way not necessarily in this but uh there may be sisters there may be brothers and I would like to just say something to you'll never regret making yourself available &gt;&gt; for service to the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in whatever way and start young Start young. I was peeling logs for a church at about 16 years old. And do you think I regret that? Not for a second. &gt;&gt; I would clean that church when I was about 18 and already felt a call for the ministry. I wasn't trying to get somebody to open up a pulpit. I just wanted to work for God. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether I'm cleaning the church or whether I'm uh playing the guitar or whether I'm singing or whatever it is. just want to bless the people. &gt;&gt; And that's what God appreciates and just use my energy, use your strength, use your resources. &gt;&gt; I can tell you. And brother Brandham said about uh he said about building a church, which I'll come to in just a moment. He says, "If you're building a house, put it on up." Because he was asked about the coming of the Lord and and what they should be doing. If you're building a house, put it on up. If Jesus comes tomorrow, you'd be found faithful at the duty. If you're building your church, go on, put it up. I'd rather be putting my money in something like that than be found with it in my pocket. So, just keep on continue as you are. And so, whatever we're doing towards the Lord's work, your life is an expression. And uh uh you know, you have to help me so I won't go too far with this, but this is all announcements. That's part of it. And I I feel very very urgent today. Whatever a person does, if you're working at the at the camp for the young people, it's not the camp, it's the young people. It's God's people. It's God's children. And you have to think of it in terms of I'm helping, I'm assisting to create an atmosphere to be here for our children. And I work for our children like they're my own children, like they're my own teenagers and my own kids. I just love them. And I think we ought to all feel that way. They don't have to be part of your family. I think it's just wonderful. We've got these little ones that come around here and I always shake their hand and they're always find me in the foyer and they're, you know, they're coming. They don't want their parents even to drag them past. They want to be sure and shake hand. And I always want to make sure I shake hand with them, too. I think that's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Also, uh so that is about Haiti. And now I want to uh make announcement for the Switzerland Easter convention. Not that it has such a great bearing here, but it does for you to be praying for it. And that is going to be on April the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th. and it is at the campus uh of uh Cersei Convention Center and uh brother Murphy Wong will be uh there as well speaking along with myself uh brother Frank Kronite had planned to be there and he is uh having he's had to work during this time so he's not able to be there but uh pastors brother Fransis Lipacar who was here and also brother Jeanjax Gerard. Uh there there are two brothers, two pastors that are cooperating and participating in the meetings. There'll be other ministers from Europe that are expected to be in attendance. And also I want to uh especially for those that are streaming from Europe, whether in Holland or Belgium or Germany or Switzerland, we want to be sure that you know that you are invited to be a part of these meetings. And we have on the screen the address and the uh phone numbers that you can call uh brother David Meyer or brother Daniel Culenbrunner and uh you can call the numbers that are on the screen and they will be able to give you further information regarding those meetings. There's going to be several that are coming from here. Uh brother Kim and sister Hedi Dingwall plan to go. Uh there's about uh 12 or more from from the church here that are planning to go to attend these meetings. Brother Murphy will be going uh further. He will be going to brother Gear Rotos. I spoke with brother Garrett Rotoald also this last week and we were I was I and my wife were supposed to go too but we just feel we won't do that. And uh then brother he's arranging also in the week for brother uh Murphy. So pray for him. And sister Tracy may be going as well. They're going to be at brother Rodwell's and perhaps brother Hank Dystra and up in Holland has asked for brother Murphy to come by could go to uh near Crayfeld Doozeldorf area where uh I was there last year with brother Murphy as well and I met him and heard him speak. And so uh you see these people friends you know you have the opportunity of hearing firsthand uh these people but there are people that go year in and year out and never hear and so I trust that you appreciate I mean people give all their almost give their eye it teeth to hear somebody that just returned from as we did on Wednesday night brother Timothy M from about two and a half months from Vietnam. Who else do you know who's been in Vietnam for two and a half months? Who else do you know who's who's maybe baptized 150 people in Vietnam? I say thank God we can be a part of that. Thank God we can even as support and say amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. How many enjoyed brother Timothy on Wednesday night? It was wonderful. Just wonderful. I should say so. And brother Murphy having been up in the interior. I've been to China several times, but I can't go where he goes. Brother Brandon was aware of that. He says the the native of the country, he's the one that can really go there and he can get to these distant places. So, we're we're looking forward to a gracious time there. And then on April the 29th through May the 2nd is going to be a dedication of the church in Moscow. I've given little tidbits of but I just decided to take time with the meeting this morning. The church in Moscow is uh is a there was three groups uh three small groups and they're gathering in different parts of the city. Incidentally, Moscow is a city of just under 12 million people. That's according to census 12 million and one of the most expensive cities in the world. Far more. You think things are expensive here? How do you like to spend several thousand US dollars a month for a condominium rent? They do. You say, "How do they live?" Well, you just have to get uh accustomed to some of these things. So, these three groups, one of them was meeting or maybe they were two of them, I don't know, but they're meeting a little storefront, some kind of commercial place, and they lost they weren't able to use that anymore. and shifted from here to there. And they and the people, you know, with the they're just peasants and poor people and maybe some are businessmen, but they put together $80,000 US over the years. They saved and scrimped and saved $80,000 and they bought a piece of land, but they could go no further. That's as far as they could go. and brother Sergey and brother Garrett Roal. Brother Sergey is brother was brother Rodal's right-hand man and he actually was in like down in Pakistan or Usbekiststan or one of those countries in the southern which was a former Soviet Union and one of the states and brother Sergey is a young man probably in his late teens or early 20s. He witnessed this message and there was some people that came in and a church was formed out of that. And so God I mean this just what happened. And then he moves to Germany and he marries a German girl and ends up in brother G Roal's church and what is isn't God full of accidents? No. It's all a plan. &gt;&gt; And here what does brother Roto needs? He needs an interpreter. He needs a translator in the Russian language. And God provides one and sticks it right in his office. &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother John. &gt;&gt; I want you people to get electrified with this. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful the way God works? &gt;&gt; He just brings the right person, brings them right in, sets him right in the office. So, he became brother Gerro's right-hand man. And then the church, the three groups came together in Moscow and they they called for brother Sergey and had to come up and minister and he would go out and minister and they said, "We want you to be our pastor." Oh, brother Ger Rotoald really had to go to prayer over that one. And he he he let him go just very reluctantly, you know, but now he's already up there. But in order for them to get there, I'm just telling you now what we've been through over the last months. In order for him to move there, they had to have a place. His wife naturally, they have four children and one was just a little infant in arms and she wasn't really anxious to pick up and move from her native country and move into Russia and had no place to live. And an apartment is so costly they couldn't even begin to afford it. So the only thing to do was to put up a building of some sort on this piece of land. And the people just said, you know, put up in the first place that we should finish as a place for the pastor to live. And I thought that was wonderful for the people and so different, you know, they got architects and all the rest of it and a a builder brother from Ria Latvia. He's a pastor of a church there. And uh uh oh my goodness, there's just so much. I mean, my mind is just racing. Uh if I just begin to tell you, you know, even this brother's from Latvia, he's the son of the old man that we visited in 1990 that saw a vision of brother Brham and told his people. And in this vision, he saw a man riding a horse and a voice spoke to him and said, "That man can tell you what you need to know." And later he saw the name on a book and uh in a Russian language and told the people, "This is the man." It was brother Brandham's name. &gt;&gt; How do you like that? And he sat right beside the pullpit here in a little chair at 80ome years old and just stared down into the people while I was able to stand behind the pulpit and said, "Your pastor saw a vision of the man who I was with and now I will stand here as a living witness to his vision." &gt;&gt; You think that didn't have some effect? And that and out of that church came the people that is the believer's work in that area right now. And I'll never forget and the brother who's in charge of that work, he's a monster of a man driving us back to where the city, which we shouldn't have left at that time. And we left, you know, kind of secretly and had because you're not supposed to leave from the city, but we went, we had to go to these churches. And uh so we're driving past and I'm looking at this car and uh this great massive Russian man and he's just hunkered over this steering wheel and driving this car back to this city. And I'm I said uh what's make is this car? He says I made it. So that's the car we were driving in and he's looking after this work now. Well, it is it is that the pastor that old pastor his son who's now a man probably 50 60 years old. He's a pastor in in Latvia in Ria Latvia. And he went down to Russia to see this church that they were planning to build. And he said, "No, this isn't the way you do it. you need to put a second floor on it and it won't cost anymore because they had a real nice roof. Take that roof off and just raise it up and and he doubled the space for just a few more loads of concrete blocks. And so they wrote here and said, "If we just can get 16 more loads of concrete blocks or something, we can have a whole second floor." And and so anyway, make a long story short, the pastor has moved and he's in the he's now got his quarters finished and they have a they have a the sanctuary is pretty primitive, but they that's why we sent some more funds just recently in December, I think it was. And so the churches in in Europe and church here and and the believers that are sent through Bible believers and so on, we've been able to send them something over $100,000. And so this will be the dedication of this church. Uh brother uh I will be attending along with brother Garrett Rodald to share in the meetings. Uh the pastor's name is brother Sergey Vulov and I I spoke to brother Peter Iban from Tacoma and his passport has expired and I have to send it to Russia to get it renewed. So I believe brother Peter is here. Are you here in the service, brother Peter? Yes. All right. And anyway, I sent an email, which I didn't get an answer to yet, and said, "Don't let them send it by mail, send it by FedEx, send it by DHL or something so he can get it back a little faster because I sure want to see him to be able to attend those meetings." And uh, Brother Kim Dingwall will be there. Brother Randy Snow is planning to go. Brother Milco and two brothers from the US plan to meet us in New York. And I just learned this morning that brother Richard is going with his his son Levi, I believe, also. So we will have not only good representation from here, but uh uh it will be a great encouragement to them over there. All right, you still with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. Good. We want to remember also this morning, we don't want to uh there isn't a whole lot to say. Brother Billy Paul uh had some test, but he said he's all right. Brother Randy Snow was speaking uh to Brother Billy and uh because they know each other very well and he said he had those tests, some tests just recently, this last week, but he said he's feeling real fine. Now, we want to have prayer. You've already prayed this morning. I'm conscious of our time. We've been quite a while. But we have brother Kim is in India right now. And I've got to say, can I take a few minutes? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been in India now this year 30 years. Do I hear something more than silence? &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And from the first month, we have never missed a month printing the messages in the prophet's language. &gt;&gt; That printing press and the printing presses have never printed one of my messages. &gt;&gt; That's not what's important. They've printed the prophet's message every month and have gone from one language now to 11 languages. I believe it is. And God has given very very faithful people over there. Brother D brother uh brother Dr. Jacobs and he's passed away and gone to be with the Lord now. But he was the right man to get it all up and running and established. The work there has had as many as 15 full-time staff and was a heavy financial burden. But people gave. I tell you what, people gave. a woman that has never been there. A woman a very very dear friend of I and my wife and she's now gone on to be with the Lord herself. She had she cared for as many as a hundred young people, not at once, but they've gone through her home. She had no husband all the years that I've known her. And she had as many as a hundred mentally challenged young people and children and young people in her home and she cared for them so that she could have the funds and send them to Bible believers to support the work in India. And besides that, she raised canaries, little song birds, and she raised them and sold them and would send probably most every year somewhere between 2,000 and 2500. I'm not taking up an offering. I'm telling what people have done. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you what they've done. If a person has the will, you'll find a way. And not everybody has the same burden. But they were burdened for India before they even came to the message. They were burdened while they were still in Pentecost. When they came into the message, praise God, &gt;&gt; we can we now know what we're that what we're doing and why we're doing it. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, don't be satisfied with uh with what we have here. And we're in a land of plenty. It could just disappear like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; It could just disappear like uh like what's happened in Haiti. It could just disappear like it's going to happen in Los Angeles. &gt;&gt; It's going to be gone. &gt;&gt; The good life is going to be gone. And I can tell you when that happens, banks will fail. &gt;&gt; Insurance companies will disappear because they won't be able to support that. The whole lifestyle of this grand North America, Canada as well, going to slide right down the tube. and I'm going to not slide with it. I'm going to ascend and go up. &gt;&gt; That's the promise that God's given us. This message that we've gathered around sitting here today has said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, it's going to slide into the ocean &gt;&gt; and the ocean will weep its way into the desert." &gt;&gt; And that's thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's the message that we're around. Whether it happens today, tomorrow, or a year from now, or 10 years from now, it's irrelevant with me. It's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Like I had a Pentecostal pastor's wife who nibbled on this message. They knew us, I and my wife, they knew us so so well. And this p this pastor's wife was a pianist for us when we first began to pastor up in Dawson Creek. And they just couldn't. They wanted they wanted something out of the uh to be respected. Excuse me, musicians for a moment. But they wanted to be respected and they couldn't let go of wanting to be a wee bit popular and recognize they could not let go of that and take a hold of the message. But a earthquake took place at uh right while a ball game was t happening I think at Candle Park in LA in in San Francisco and shook and the highway overpasses fell down. How many remember that? &gt;&gt; Quite a number of you remember that right while a ball game was happening and I heard a news reporter says somebody trying to tell us something. And I say, you know, something was speaking to him and and I don't know how many people lost their lives, but the first thing that happened is I got a phone call right away from this pastor's wife who could not accept the message, but soon as the earthquake happened, she's on the phone. She asked me, she said, "What did Brother Brandham say about the earthquake in California?" And somebody was saying that there he said that there's going to be three. Hey, it's already too late. If you're going to wait till after the fact, it's already too late. So, well, I'll find out then. No, it's already too late. &gt;&gt; We know now. We've been told now. We've been warned now. We've been instructed now. And so, we don't have to wait for that to take place. &gt;&gt; So, I thank God. and and and now in in India, Brother Kim sent a wonderful wonderful report and and advanced things much much further than I thought could be done just in a few days. He's only been there two three days. He's been with brother Moses. This is what I need you to pray about. We have had for about a year, a year and a half uh all in the works to change the work in India dramatically because today technology will allow that we can do do better with less people in a smaller location. We've got a large three-story building which was built there for this work for the William Brandham Good News Society. And now we need to move that to a much smaller place much uh much tighter uh uh uh unit and it's going to be a large digital printing unit so that a pastor could call and simply say I need 200 of this title now with the hub it ties in with the hub and it's going to be a regional distribution area instead of this big building three stories we got one whole floor of inventory of books because if you start fire up that big press, you need to keep it running in order to print enough so that you'll have a few thousand left over for churches that come and believers that come for the next year or two because you're not going to print those again. But now that's not the case anymore. And so you just work from a much smaller press. So the all the equipment this big press and so on which was bought from Nova Scotia that all that press and that equipment will be sold we don't need the packing people because now it's just on demand and that to me I'm so enthused and so happy about it you know listen friends I don't have relatives in India I don't have any emotional ties there but God opened a door there and I thank God for it I want to be able to stand before the Lord Jesus and say, "Well, we did what we could and I spoke to the people and we spoke to the world and spoke about it in conventions and did we did what we could. &gt;&gt; We got the word out as we could." And how many here have how many here have been blessed by reading a message. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Have to forgive me. And so that's what's happening right now. And we just wanted the people in India. And here God put it in their hearts and they went right moved right into it. And this is what brother uh Kim has been doing in India. Brother Victor Adamora is still in Nigeria and will be until March. And so we want to pray for them. Uh but this is this is the plan. Brother Tony has sent an email and I'm sure many here received it as well that that some uh believers or Christians in Iran. I don't know them. Does uh do you know brother Matthew knew those people? Sister Geneva. They're in Iran. I don't know if you heard about it, but uh I I'm sure that because those are the contacts brother Tony actually got I think from brother Matthew. And so we want to remember them. They're under a death threat right now. All right, I'll have you stand. It's not the usual I take this much time, but I would like to uh Okay. Yeah, I made I made an error, but brother brother Jean Jax I said Gerard actually is brother Michel. I'm sorry. Brother Jean Jax Michel. So you'll forgive me, brother Jean Jax, when you hear this. All right, we want to have prayer and remember these requests. Will you join with me? I wonder if we could just sing, have faith in God. Have faith in God for the answer. Will you pick it up for me? [Music] &gt;&gt; Faith in God. [Music] Have faith in God. Have faith in God for the answer. Have faith in God. Dear heavenly father, we're coming to you because we do have faith in God, the living God, the only true living God. You are the God that Abraham worshiped, the God of Abraham. You're the God that Isaac worshiped, the God of Isaac. You're the God that Jacob worshiped and the prophets of the Old Testament, the seers and the sages, the patriarchs. You're the God of the apostles. You're the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ that sent him for to be a substitute for us. You're my substitute, Lord Jesus. And today in your name, we come and we ask that your name will be lifted up and glorified in this service. We pray that you will bless the people that we have spoken of. Whether it be in Switzerland, whether it be in Russia, whether it be in China or Vietnam or India, we pray that you will bless the believers. Oh God, the bride of Jesus Christ around this globe. It is your inheritance. How we were speaking of it this morning, Lord. This is what you have on the earth. This is your family. These are your children, oh God. Bless brother Kim. Give him wisdom, strength, and courage. I pray watch over him, Lord. our brother Victor Adam Moore. Oh God, as he moves around amongst the people, I pray you'll you will be mindful, oh God, and give him the kind of wisdom he needs, words that will come to him, Lord, at the right moment. And I pray you'll bless our brother Dio, oh God, under a great strain at this time. He's bearing a great burden. We remember when Moses was so burdened with such a great burden of such a multitude of people. I pray you'll strengthen our little brother's body, oh God. That you will encourage him and infuse him, Father, with wisdom from above. May the Holy Ghost prepare the way ahead and provide for them, Lord, as they have need. And now for this morning, we have need, Lord. I have need. I'm so depending upon you. I'm praying that the word will have entrance into the hearts of the people. Cause them to be receptive, oh Lord. cause them to be in expectation. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, bless your word now as it goes forth, I pray, amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And everybody said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Thank you. Open your Bibles if you would. Thank you for musicians for staying so long. Now, I want to read out of Luke's gospel. Going to move along as quickly as I can. uh the fourth chapter reading a from the 16th to the 21st verse. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written. That's one of the most marvelous statements in the Bible for me. He found he found the place where it was written. In other words, he found the place of the promise for that very moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord &gt;&gt; is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. Can we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted. Can the brokenhearted say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; To preach deliverance to the captives. We can say, "Praise the Lord." And recovering of sight to the blind. To set at liberty them that are bruised. Praise God. Hallelujah. to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." &gt;&gt; And then a scripture that we all know so well, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to speak about &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; the promise for today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for those of you and the young people that are maybe not so familiar with the message, if you want to read and hear about the other half of the scripture, Isaiah 61 and2 where it says to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book. That's half of the scripture. If you want to read the other half, go into birth pains in 1965. And brother Brandham had a brand new Bible and couldn't get to find the scripture he wanted to read. And a priest came from behind and said, "Here, read it out of my book." And he said something about this is the Lord. Read it out of my book. He read it out of the priest's book and handed it back to him and and preached birth pains that the earth is in a the throws of another birth pain. And he says, "This one's going to cause it to go right into eternity." &gt;&gt; And then he preached right immediately after that this day. Cuz then when he got back out of there, he he saw the whole thing unfold out of the scripture. And then he came back and preached this day. Is this scripture &gt;&gt; fulfilled in your ears? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not here on a history program, friends. We're not here for some pie in the sky in the future. We're here because this promise is for this day. This message is for this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you as you have your seats. &gt;&gt; God has ordained certain things to happen. in a certain season &gt;&gt; for a certain time. &gt;&gt; And that's always been his way. &gt;&gt; And by his spoken word, God brought forth &gt;&gt; and will finish his will and his purpose in his in his season. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us quickly, and so you'll just stay real attentive because I'm going to move along real quickly. And God called the light day and the darkness he called night in Genesis 1 and5 as the Bible is being opened. And the evening and the morning were the first day. I could spend quite a long time on the evening and the morning were the first day. In 1 and8 and God called the firmament heaven, and the evening and the morning were the second day. and 1 and 12. And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself. And the evening and the morning were the third day. In Genesis 1 and 16, and God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and he made the stars also, and the evening and the morning were the fourth day. God had a program and he stuck right with the program. He did on the second day and the third day and the first day and the fifth day what he wanted to do on that day &gt;&gt; in that time. And God created great wield great whales and every living creature that moveth which waters brought forth abundantly after their kind. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth a living creature after his kind, cattle and creeping things, and the beast of the earth after his kind." And it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the earth. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the sea, and over the fowl, and over the cattle, and over the earth, and over every creeping thing." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. And God saw everything that he had made. And behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. And on the seventh day, God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from it all. In other words, God did specific things. And we say, well, that day was a thousand years long. And we also have a message which the prophet has spoken of that is the message of this day, but it's not a 24-hour period. It's a certain it's a certain period of time and and that's all within God's God's spirit may fall and come at a certain moment and you know as it did on the day of Pentecost and then there'll be a moment there will be there will be a point in time when the Holy Spirit actually lifts off of the earth. the Holy Spirit will lift off of the earth and God will leave all wickedness to itself void of any restraint. &gt;&gt; You think it almost looks like that right now and sometimes I think it almost is like that. But I'm glad for the tug of the Holy Spirit. We may not see where the kite is, but we got the string in our hand and we can feel the pull of the Holy Spirit and it's pulling us upward &gt;&gt; all the time. And and the prophet of God said in the message shalom, the word of Moses time did not work in the days of Jesus time. Jesus couldn't come with Moses message. The word in the days of the apostles does not work. He said in this day, &gt;&gt; it's a promised word for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the scripture says the apostle Paul when he's speaking now to the Hebrews that were believing in Moses and they would always refer back to Moses. He said, "Wherefore, holy brethren, those these were Hebrews and Jews who had come out uh and and and and as a result of the early church and the power of God in the church, there had been Hebrew believers. And now he's speaking to them because he doesn't want them to lapse back into the previous age like many even in the message unfortunately have lapsed back to a denominational methods denominational ideas and even even so into the message a denominational doctrine. &gt;&gt; Wherefore holy brethren he's saying partakers of the heavenly calling. Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, who sang it? The Holy Ghost saith &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; if you will hear his voice, &gt;&gt; he said, take heed, brethren, verse 12, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. And when when Jesus was confronted with the apost not the apostles I'm sorry the scribes and Pharisees and the religious leaders and about the resurrection and various questions and and and Jesus had to tell them God is not a god of the dead. &gt;&gt; God is a God of the living. &gt;&gt; When he says God's a God of the living, what's he saying? God's a God of the now. &gt;&gt; God's a God of today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, &gt;&gt; and forever. &gt;&gt; That's what's important. Brother Brandham used that phrase, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever over 600 times in his ministry, starting at the very earliest of the message and starting and it goes on service after service every year. every year and multitudes of days, multitudes of cities. I ask you, was there any time that he spoke that that Jesus was not effective on that day? &gt;&gt; You get my point? &gt;&gt; Here's a prophet on earth and he's saying in 1947 448 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Was he impre was he trying to impress the people that he was the he that it was yesterday or that it's tomorrow he's concerned with? No. He wants the people to be impressed with it's today. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ today. And so he said now I'll prove the resurrection of Jesus Christ. He said if you believed it back then you might say he said oh if I was back then I would have believed it. He said, "It's the same one who's here now. &gt;&gt; I'm here to prove he's here today. &gt;&gt; This message is not a message of yesterday. It's not a whole bunch of scheming about tomorrow or the future. We're not trying to study and dissect every age and every time and how this person did it." But all we look at the past is to say that's the way he was back there and he had believers back there who believed he was alive today. Amen. &gt;&gt; All through the whole New Testament, they had a witness of the Holy Spirit. He's alive today and they received what he what they had. Some some didn't have it. They were thinking of only the future. And brother Brandon says that's that's the problem with man. We we rejoice in what he was and we have anticipation of what he will be, but we miss what he is. Now, &gt;&gt; let this congregation know we're not talking about the past or the future. We're talking about this moment. &gt;&gt; We're talking about this service. &gt;&gt; We're talking about this moment where you sit and what you hear. &gt;&gt; What we believe is a God &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I believe that he's present now. &gt;&gt; I believe what he did back there, he is here to do now again. If &gt;&gt; you have not been filled with the Holy Ghost, he will fill you with the true Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. Which is which is the full revelation and understanding of the word of God. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit's the author of this word. It's the Holy Spirit that was speaking through a prophet in this time. That was the Holy Spirit. It's not yesterday. It's now today. &gt;&gt; You need a drink from the fountain. You don't want stagnant water from the past. You don't want to think about, oh, there might be some rain in the future. You want to say, today &gt;&gt; the showers of blessing are falling. &gt;&gt; Today I have a resource. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherefore, holy brethren, &gt;&gt; he's a God of the living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The living God is nothing less than the living word. &gt;&gt; This message &gt;&gt; is not just a series of books and tapes and discs. &gt;&gt; This message is a living word. &gt;&gt; It's alive. &gt;&gt; It's vibrant. It has a personality because it's none less than Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You can feel him. Yes, &gt;&gt; you can talk to him. &gt;&gt; It's a living person. &gt;&gt; If you think it's a book, you'll never you'll miss him. &gt;&gt; If you think it's something of 40 years ago, you'll miss it. &gt;&gt; It's not 40 years ago. Brother Brandon was proving he was the same then. Jesus Christ the same yesterday in 48, in 49, in 1950, in 51, in 52, up in 64, 65, into the last messages. Why? Because he was the same one. &gt;&gt; And he was proving meeting after meeting, month after month, that he is alive. &gt;&gt; And that's what you and I are here for. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to be blessed. We're here to prove that he is alive &gt;&gt; and that indeed he lives in me and he lives in you and that's your purpose of being here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May it be so. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, may the Holy Ghost fall upon this congregation and give you a revelation that you are here on a mission. You are here. You are called of God. You're here for a special purpose. &gt;&gt; To prove that he's alive &gt;&gt; so that he can get glory. &gt;&gt; We are here to get glory to the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Jesus said to the leaders that they had aired. He says, "I'm the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." God is not the God of the dead, &gt;&gt; but of the living. &gt;&gt; He's for the living. &gt;&gt; He's in the time of the living. &gt;&gt; He's here to do whatever it is that we have need. And Jesus said unto him in Luke 24:43, "Verily I say unto thee, speaking to the thief on the cross, who was changed, a treacherous man, &gt;&gt; a man who lived by treachery &gt;&gt; and horrible crimes. They It was the worst of criminals that hung on a cross. &gt;&gt; And he was hanging there. And the Bible says in two of the two of the epistles that the thieves plural railed on him. &gt;&gt; They railed on him. They railed on Jesus Christ. But no one some some kind of an atmosphere. Something came over him and he began to see that this man and he even rebuked his friend. He said this he said we suffer justly for our crimes. This man has done nothing. &gt;&gt; He's done nothing. And finally, his eyes were opened and he saw something. He received a revelation the apostles didn't have. &gt;&gt; He received a a revelation that Mary, who the Catholic Church lifts up to heaven, Mary didn't have it. &gt;&gt; None of the women had it. &gt;&gt; None of the men had it. &gt;&gt; But the thief on the cross got it. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he was the last one &gt;&gt; under that dispensation. &gt;&gt; The last one that came in. &gt;&gt; He didn't see the first pull. He didn't see the second pull of Jesus ministry. He didn't hear his message of his third pull. But on the cross, he got a revelation that was beyond any of them that heard. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was beyond those that ate the bread and the fishes. &gt;&gt; It was beyond those that just got blessed at a camp or in a service. &gt;&gt; He got a revelation from God. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, remember me. &gt;&gt; When you come into your kingdom, &gt;&gt; he recognized he was a king. &gt;&gt; He recognized there was a kingdom. And he recognized he wasn't dying, but he was coming into his kingdom. &gt;&gt; And what was Jesus first word? Today, &gt;&gt; why don't you say it? Today &gt;&gt; you'll be with me &gt;&gt; in paradise. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. Not some pie in the sky. &gt;&gt; Not some history from the past. Today &gt;&gt; you'll be with me in paradise. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's hard for me to lower my voice. &gt;&gt; I just I feel so enthused, so gripped and so moved. &gt;&gt; This is the same Jesus. The same one that stood on hung on the cross and said today he's here today. &gt;&gt; He's here in this service. His holy spirit is here. And his holy spirit is pleased that I'm telling you he's a god of the living. He's a god of today. He wants to fill you. He wants to move you. He wants to do things for you. &gt;&gt; You're his children. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Bren says, "Man is still the same. &gt;&gt; He's always thanking God for what he has done. &gt;&gt; Looking forward to what he will do &gt;&gt; and ignoring what he is doing. &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to look up and say, "Father, I'm not ignoring what you're doing. You're a God of the now. &gt;&gt; You're a God of this moment. The only thing that stands in our way is our unbelief. &gt;&gt; We put it off or we elevate our problem &gt;&gt; higher than his power to deliver. &gt;&gt; God is not concerned about your problem because his power is greater than your problem. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You believe it? There's too many today within the ranks of the message. They read what the Holy Ghost has spoken in this day and yet somehow ignore it or simply will not receive it. I have read the powerful truths of the message to those who have professed to be believers and who have sat in churches claiming and they have a profession but I have found it to be an empty profession because when they say this is what the word says this is exactly what pro God's messenger has said and somehow they will take their events or they will take what their thoughts are and somehow ev it evolves into something else. And really what it is, really what it is, listen to me very closely now. There's a danger lest we take the circumstances of our lives &gt;&gt; or where we are in our present life and our present condition or our present experience and take the message and the message says something different. Rather, as the prophet says, we need to make surrender our lives to be molded to that. &gt;&gt; But what they do instead is adjust this until it fits their present situation. &gt;&gt; That's not what God wants. &gt;&gt; That's not the program of God &gt;&gt; to to take the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I thought of, and I'm not wanting to put any uh any bondage on you, but to say, why are you here? &gt;&gt; Well, I'm here because my friends are here. &gt;&gt; Sorry, that's the wrong reason. &gt;&gt; I'm here because my husband or my wife is here. Even that's the wrong reason. &gt;&gt; I'm here because I was born and raised in the message. And uh uh and so I just this is the pattern of my life. That's the wrong reason. &gt;&gt; What a person you say well what is the right reason. The right reason is I have had an experience with this living God. &gt;&gt; He has spoken to me. I have felt his I have felt him in my heart. I have felt a a work within my soul. I feel him moving. I hear him speaking. I have a relationship with him. And I know that he's alive. And I come to hear the word of God preached. I come to have my soul edified. And that's why I come to the house of God. I come here also to be a blessing to someone else. I come here because I'm a member of the body of Jesus Christ. I come to shake their hand. I come to let my words, the best words out of my mouth. God bless you. &gt;&gt; That's why I come. That's why I'm here. Then we're here for the right reason. And if we have a church full of people that come for those reasons, then you're going to see things move. You're going to see the supernatural happen because you cannot stop it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I want to address the young people for a moment, the youth, and those of you that are in your teens and so on. What a wonderful time of your life. What a wonderful era when you got your youth and your strength and your beauty and your your physique for you young men. What an opportunity. &gt;&gt; What a glorious time &gt;&gt; to give it to God's work and to God's people. What a wonderful privilege it is to be able to say, "Well, I'm so thankful I could give my time and give my energy to the work of God. Don't get quiet on me now. &gt;&gt; I thought of you, Brother Raymond, Sister Ree, or your wife. I thought of you. I thought of you, Sister Karen. I thought of the meals that have been I thought of you sisters that have worked amongst the uh young people." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you you say, "Well," and some might say, "Oh, well, I I haven't got any time for that. I haven't got I don't even go off to those camps. I haven't got any time." What about the cup of cold water? &gt;&gt; What about the cup of cold water? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We could preach a cold water &gt;&gt; doctrine. What about that cup of cold water? &gt;&gt; You got times I take and hand a cup of cold water. Not if somebody comes panting and and and desperately needing a cup. That's not it. You offer it, &gt;&gt; you give it. Lighten up their load and make their life easier and you bless them with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One year I and my wife, we said, you know, our ch our children were quite small and we naturally have them home around the Christmas holidays and that time. So, you know what we're going to do? We're going to invite people, not friends. These are people we hardly know. We're going to invite them to our home. We're going to have them here for dinner. We did that on one occasion. We did it on another occasion when we were we're still in the log church. We said, "We're going to have people that don't have a home and don't have a family and we know they have no place to go. We're going to have them for over Christmas season." And it was one of those that sat uh he he he was a he was a believer brother working in the logging camps and he sat on our couch and I was sitting right across from him. He took his billfold out and pulled out a little picture and it was a picture of the boy from Finland that had been raised from the dead and he held the picture up. Now this is a stranger, not a stranger entirely, but he was not a part of the our church. She was over living on Vancouver Island going to Mike and Maryland's uh church and he just held this little picture up. He says, "Do do you have you seen this picture?" "Oh, yes." I said, "I've seen that picture. That's the boy that was raised from the dead in Finland." He said, "Yeah, that's right." He says, "I was just in his home. I was just visiting him." I thought, "What a reward." &gt;&gt; All we had to give was a little bit of turkey or chicken or something. And here I'm sitting with a brother that has talked with this boy that been raised from the dead. He said he's a he's a traffic policeman now outside of the city of Helsinki. That's the only man I've ever met in all my life that sat and talked to that boy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And here we hadn't even fed him yet. &gt;&gt; And God already gave me a reward before we even had a chance to feed him. I thought, how wonderful. Here I am. I don't know how many people in the world got to sit with him. How many people I saw that picture many times, but now I can say to you, I got to talk to the man who sat and talked to the boy that was raised from the dead. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a God of today. &gt;&gt; And you young people, believe me, you will never regret. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even the children, you'll never regret giving your heart to Jesus Christ. And you parents and older people, you'll never regret praying for them. You teachers, God bless you. Sister Jenny, brother uh Terry John, Sister Ramona, God bless you teachers, you'll never regret &gt;&gt; harboring those children, praying for them, and letting them get a part of your heart. You'll never regret it. You people here, you'll never regret having identified yourself with Jesus Christ in this day. &gt;&gt; He's been crucified again. &gt;&gt; He's despised, &gt;&gt; but we've been given an opportunity to bring him another drink of fresh water. &gt;&gt; Do it. &gt;&gt; Give him the best part of your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thought a lot about you, brother Daniel. What was it? 14 years old. you start to do something. I I thought of this brother. He needs to give his testimony for you young people. &gt;&gt; And here he started as a young just a young teenager with just a passion to do something for God and wrote me an email in the last few days. You know what his the title on his email is? Forgive me for saying this. His email is last week. My preoccupation. &gt;&gt; I'm preoccupied. Right. &gt;&gt; I can't get this out of my mind. &gt;&gt; I'm here to do something for God. &gt;&gt; May God open doors for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Want you to know they got a hold of my heart cuz I was about that same age and I had that was my preoccupation but I didn't know it at the time. &gt;&gt; I just couldn't get rid of it. &gt;&gt; I'm not here because I have to have a pulpit to preach in. I got invitation from South America, from Brazil, and from Peru. And I got about four or five in one week last week. &gt;&gt; People think they can discredit a ministry. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to happen that easy, friend. &gt;&gt; From Germany and from Switzerland and from Moscow and from Peru and from Brazil and from Cape Town, South Africa in about about 10 days time. Can't even go to them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't even near go to them. &gt;&gt; I feel a responsibility. But I'm saying here to this church, &gt;&gt; this God, &gt;&gt; and I I I I'm here behind this pulpit to tell you the truth of God's word is the same in my heart today as it was yesterday as it was when I was 18 or when I was 20. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing to get in a car and drive all night to go to another place, drive through the mud, pick up kids, let a new car get full of mud because why? Just wanted to do something for God. &gt;&gt; Pounded over some of the worst roads you could imagine to go to the native Indian people to have a meeting outside. Oh, was it some big arrangement? No. We just went there and they gathered. And do you think I regret it? Not for a minute. &gt;&gt; Not for a minute. put our kids in the back of the station wagon and drive all night to get home so they can go to school in the morning. I never regret that. &gt;&gt; No. And you mightn't say, "Well, that's your situation." That's exactly right. But in your place, you can brighten the corner where you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't need We don't need a big pulpit. We don't need a big church for you to be able to do that. &gt;&gt; Be fruitful &gt;&gt; in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to help me to shut down. &gt;&gt; I'm not getting anywhere with my sermon. &gt;&gt; As part of my burden, I've witnessed and I feel I have to say these things. I've witnessed in this message very troubling things I've witnessed in this message where ministers and believers and where ministers will even allow their people and not only allow their people will lead their people because they themselves they've allowed the message to evolve into something nothing more than an empty profession. &gt;&gt; It's an empty profession. &gt;&gt; And they're just certain they know the right language and know the right words and talk about Malachi 4 and Luke 17:30 and and Revelation 1 and 10 and 1 and and all of these things. &gt;&gt; To me, it's not an empty profession. It's a living, burning presence of a living God &gt;&gt; that's alive now today. &gt;&gt; And I want some that some of what I'm feeling to pour off onto you. &gt;&gt; If you don't feel it, let it pour onto you. &gt;&gt; Even just say this morning, "Oh God, let what let what Brother Ed is feeling, let let it pour into me as well. Let my soul be consumed &gt;&gt; to live for you. &gt;&gt; Even if you live quietly, live for him. &gt;&gt; Spend your life for him. &gt;&gt; Let it be, as our brother Daniel said, &gt;&gt; preoccupation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not enough just to admire somebody else and admire brother Murphy or brother Ivan or brother Timothy or some of these. We don't have to be out in front. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be that. We just have to be at our post of duty. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, here he is. Who who had a bigger portion? Nobody. And nobody had a bigger portion in this generation. But to have him say, "If you're a housewife, &gt;&gt; you're a housewife here. God bless you. You have a tremendous mission on earth. Young man, young woman, &gt;&gt; singles, whatever we are, children, young people, farmers, be the best one. &gt;&gt; Whatever you can do. &gt;&gt; You're in business, be the best one. &gt;&gt; You're a worker, be the best one you can be. Let that be your testimony. Say, "Until God moves me out of here, I'm going to be the best I can &gt;&gt; right where I'm at. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to make myself available. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just wish I could do so much more. &gt;&gt; I just have a fire burning in my bones. Have people some people that come by hear it all the time. Ridicule. Maybe something that I've had missions ridiculed. &gt;&gt; They haven't looked into the faces of people like brother Daniel and look into my eyes and I look into those dark eyes and he wants the message if I can only have it. Do you know how I can get it? And then I come home to say, "Oh, that missions." &gt;&gt; You know, somebody put himself forward as a minister. They talked about missions. Of course, we've been out there in front for a long time. And some of the stuff you don't want to hear, but you might as well hear it. I had to hear it. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Missions." And spat on the platform. you're quiet and I had some great revelation. Do you think I can say a little what you said in your email, Sister Karen? a minister of this message supposed to be I don't consider a minister not the message I know &gt;&gt; taking groups of young girls young ladies &gt;&gt; and he doesn't have a wife at this time and he's taking young ladies on scuba diving trip to some other country s southern country in the Caribbean minister this message says he is and people hold him as a pastor and afraid to leave. I tell you what this prophet said if a pastor doesn't preach this message and doesn't believe this word I'd leave him. &gt;&gt; And that'd be my advice to anybody here in this congregation or streaming. If a me if a pro if a minister of this message wouldn't declare the whole council of God and believe it and live by it, I'd leave him. &gt;&gt; And if I don't believe every part of this word, then you're free to leave it &gt;&gt; and leave me. &gt;&gt; But first, before you do, pray for me. &gt;&gt; That'd be the most important thing. &gt;&gt; Pray for the man of God. But I wouldn't I wouldn't couch out of that. I wouldn't give into that. &gt;&gt; And regardless of how many may speak against missions or against they don't they haven't experienced what I've experienced. You could not take it. It's a part of my own soul. You'd have to cut my heart out. &gt;&gt; And that's the way the people What about Jesus Christ? What is the last commission? And the prophet of God said the great commission. &gt;&gt; And God never took that commission away. He says it'll be a part of the church till we go home. &gt;&gt; Go ye &gt;&gt; into all the world &gt;&gt; and preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; This is the gospel. &gt;&gt; You have the gospel. God's entrusted to you the gospel of this hour because it is a living word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not a word of yesterday. &gt;&gt; It's today. If you hear his voice, &gt;&gt; harden not your heart. As in the provocation when they when I he tried him in the wilderness. Don't harden your heart. Don't have any resistance. Just say, "Oh God, I throw my heart's door wide open. &gt;&gt; Talk to me. &gt;&gt; Invite him. Sometimes people feel well you shouldn't say anything negative over the pulpit. I Jesus said quite a few things were negative. &gt;&gt; But when you say them in a certain way then they can be a positive thing. &gt;&gt; A warning can be a positive thing. an end time message. End time messenger. Can I have a few more minutes, please? Brother Brandon was talking about the woman at the well and he said she left her water pot and ran into the city and said, "Come see a man that told me all things that ever I did. Isn't this the very Messiah?" That's him. He said, "If the people could only see that today." &gt;&gt; He was going back there 2,000 years ago, but then he brings it forward 2,000 years. If the people, &gt;&gt; are we people? &gt;&gt; We're humans. &gt;&gt; He's talking about us. If they could only see it today, &gt;&gt; he says, "Then they'd know the day we're living in." &gt;&gt; And they would see it's God's promise for this day. Amen. &gt;&gt; God said it would be this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love the scripture which we read because I &gt;&gt; if you were there in that day, you'd have seen where Jesus actually was searching through the scripture &gt;&gt; to find the place &gt;&gt; that was speaking of him for that moment. &gt;&gt; I tell you my friends, God has given us a laser guidance into the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we never tire of them. &gt;&gt; I read you can read revelation &gt;&gt; 3 and 14 where they the message to the Leodysian church. You could read it this afternoon and then you want to utter a prayer in this day and say, "Oh God, I'm so thankful I'm not a part of that. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad you've delivered me from that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus could have spoke of himself out of all the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Every scripture in the Bible speaks of him. He could have spoken of himself from all the scriptures &gt;&gt; as he had the two men on the way to Emmas and he's speaking to Cleopus. He's he's telling them and the Bible says he spoke to them out of all the scriptures the things concerning himself. But now when he stood in the synagogue that day and it was delivered to him the the scroll of the prophet Isaiah and he rolls it out and he's looking until he finds the place because it had to be that scripture for this very day and that same Lord Jesus Christ. Now when he's gone his Elijah his spirit of Elijah prophet messenger in this time and something takes place and he doesn't quite he's even anxious over it why I couldn't get the scripture this Bible's been misprinted and then then a few hours later or the next day or so God tells him and points him to this scripture &gt;&gt; and lets him know that's what happened again &gt;&gt; because it's me back in Luke 4. And it's me here in this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you're witnesses of it. &gt;&gt; And you're here &gt;&gt; and everyone else &gt;&gt; of Christianity. They can read Luke the 4th chapter &gt;&gt; and they see it and believe that's happened to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But it's not the God of yesterday. &gt;&gt; He's a God of the living. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those people who Jesus read the scripture to are all in the grave. &gt;&gt; He's not the God of those that are gone and not the God of history. He's the God of the living. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham saw in the scriptures certain ones he looked at what was to happen in this day &gt;&gt; and watch closely for the fulfillment in the third seal. He said when I see that God has promised to do a certain thing in this day when he promised to break open break off these seals till this till this last day and you don't know the joy and you don't know the joy and the glory when I seen him reveal this stand there and watch it happen and know that I'll take any person or charge and char or charge he never did say one thing to us but what had happened that way and then to see the joy that's in my heart when I see his promise &gt;&gt; for this last day &gt;&gt; what is he saying what am I saying to you listen friends if you don't have a joy &gt;&gt; from having seeing these things happening in your day then you need to pray about that to begin with oh God restore Pour unto me the joy of my salvation. Let it let the joy and the glory that you gave to the prophet when he saw these things happening. &gt;&gt; It's this day. &gt;&gt; You're alive. &gt;&gt; You're here. &gt;&gt; You're present. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is present. &gt;&gt; God is present. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire is here. The very pillar of fire that Moses talked to &gt;&gt; and God spoke through that pillar of fire in a burning bush. That pillar of fire is here today. &gt;&gt; You say, "But where's the burning bush?" &gt;&gt; I'm one bush. &gt;&gt; You're another bush, Brother Andes. &gt;&gt; Are you another bush, Brother Nathan? &gt;&gt; Are we flaming bushes &gt;&gt; and no man can put the fire out? We've been chosen to burn in this time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank God for burning bushes. &gt;&gt; And there's a voice in the bush. &gt;&gt; And there's a voice in these bushes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same God &gt;&gt; is here in these bushes. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; And you can't put it out. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I don't feel that fire." You stay here today and you will feel that fire. I remember when &gt;&gt; brother Milo Ravar, God bless him when he got when he met this fire and it began to flame in his own soul &gt;&gt; and he's in the airlines of purser and for the airlines and they're serving liquor and he doesn't want to serve liquor let the girls do it and they're coming with their shag hair. He felt so sorry for him. They used to look good to him. Excuse me, brother Milco. But now they look like he said, "Look, you look like you a dog that's had a bath." &gt;&gt; And then the union &gt;&gt; and and the and the the management said, "Shut it off." He said, "I can't find the stop button. It's getting me into so much trouble. Show me the stop button so I can push it. But nobody could find the stop button. He couldn't find the stop button. There is no stop button on this bush. There's a burning bush. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen in the balcony? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, you're just enthused, brother Biscll." You're right. I am enthused. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought of Caleb this morning &gt;&gt; and I even said when he was in his 80s, 85 or something and 40 years before, he said, "My strength is not diminished." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give me this mountain. &gt;&gt; I say, "Give me the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Give me the rapture." [Applause] We got the best thing on earth. &gt;&gt; Did you hear Vancouver has the Olympics? &gt;&gt; Someone might rise as high as get on a pedestal. I'm going higher. &gt;&gt; We're going higher than some pedestal &gt;&gt; to have a gold medal around their neck. I got the gold of Christ's character inside this meeting. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The gift from God, &gt;&gt; not from some Olympic committee. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is promised for this day? I've got to quit. &gt;&gt; But what is promised for this day? If you want something interesting, go and punch it in your computer and just punch this in with italics on both sides. The bride will &gt;&gt; Thank you, my friend. &gt;&gt; The bride will. &gt;&gt; Can I just give you a few? &gt;&gt; The bride will &gt;&gt; when not yesterday, today. The bride will be called out &gt;&gt; during this time. &gt;&gt; Can you say, "I've been called out." &gt;&gt; Not yesterday. Not in history. I've been called out. &gt;&gt; The bride will be a lovely lady. &gt;&gt; I don't have to tell you how nice you are. Elijah told you how nice you are. The bride will be a lovely lady, &gt;&gt; a lady of the word, &gt;&gt; unadulterated, not touched by any man's organization and any man-made theory. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; And you don't need to say just the bride's a lovely lady. You have to say yourself. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; He said I'm a masterpiece. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a lovely lady &gt;&gt; of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride will know her husband. &gt;&gt; We're not going to sit there and kind of &gt;&gt; uh what's that about the word? &gt;&gt; No. No. When she hears things about him &gt;&gt; and and a prophet said something else and I love it. I keep it as a phrase. It's branded in my mind. The bride is attracted to the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you say this is this is what the this is what the word of God says. This is the unveiling of him by his messenger. &gt;&gt; And then you look at it and people won't have a downcast and say, "Isn't that wonderful?" She'll be attracted to the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; The bride will be the flesh &gt;&gt; and bones &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Is this just a statement on paper? &gt;&gt; Are these just some words that spoken out of William Brandon's mouth &gt;&gt; or did this come as thus sayeth the Lord to you? &gt;&gt; Do you receive it as a message from Jesus Christ? That's exactly what he said about you. You're the flesh and bones &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It'll take on new meaning when you hear, &gt;&gt; "I'm the body of Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; You will walk different. &gt;&gt; You'll feel different. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you will be different. Praise God. &gt;&gt; The bride &gt;&gt; that fell into the ground at Naa has come back to original word grain again. [Music] &gt;&gt; And now going to close in a few moments. The bride will say &gt;&gt; the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; He said the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will say &gt;&gt; she'll say the same thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you hear someone else punching something else, this is what I think or this is what we think. Don't give a second moment to it. &gt;&gt; Your mind is too valuable. It's a womb for the word of God. &gt;&gt; What the authenticated prophet has said, the bride will say, [Applause] &gt;&gt; we can surely say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride will be married to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They and the bride will be so much like him, &gt;&gt; they will even be in his very image. &gt;&gt; The bride will be caught away. &gt;&gt; The bride will be caught away. &gt;&gt; She's not going to be on the phone asking, "What did Brother Brham say about the earthquake? not going to be saying, "What did he say about this or what did he say about that?" &gt;&gt; The bride will be caught away. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is rest in that. &gt;&gt; He said it. &gt;&gt; We believe it. &gt;&gt; And that settles it. &gt;&gt; The bride &gt;&gt; will be caught away. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll be taking a step one day perhaps. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be sitting at a table. You may be at your work &gt;&gt; and you'll take one step &gt;&gt; at a time &gt;&gt; right into eternity. Brother Brandham said when he was taken beyond the curtain of time and that was actually like a translation, &gt;&gt; he told me with his own lips. He said, "Brother Eddie, &gt;&gt; he said, "I I was laying right there." He said, "I had my hands behind my head." And he said, "I was just saying, well, Bill Brandham, if you're going to do anything for God, you're now 52. If you're going to do anything for God, you better get up and get going." said just then one stood beside the bed &gt;&gt; said I've come to show you things that you've asked about &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; things you've questioned and wanted to know &gt;&gt; he says there was no sensation of movement &gt;&gt; I was immediately &gt;&gt; standing looking at my body &gt;&gt; from maybe 20 ft away &gt;&gt; I was still sitting there &gt;&gt; still sitting there leaning against the wall with hands behind his head &gt;&gt; he said and immediately instantly no feeling no sensation Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He said then he looked and here was here was a millions of people &gt;&gt; looked like to him &gt;&gt; and he saw the ladies first &gt;&gt; when he said another place I saw you all there &gt;&gt; I want to say to our sisters &gt;&gt; maybe you were part of that number &gt;&gt; and they come running &gt;&gt; to him. Isn't this amazing? And they said, "Our brother, our precious brother." &gt;&gt; And then the men came. &gt;&gt; And our brother, our precious brother. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham is saying to the one that's with him, "Who are these?" &gt;&gt; He said, "These are your people." &gt;&gt; He said, "Are brands?" &gt;&gt; No. He said, "The ones you've won to Christ." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Multitudes of them. He said, "Brother Eddie, I bit my finger." &gt;&gt; He said, "I pinched my hand." &gt;&gt; And I felt for my hair. And he says, "All my hair, my head was full of hair again." &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's very much like this." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Beautiful wilderness of northern &gt;&gt; British Columbia. &gt;&gt; He said, and that's why he said to the people, I can never be the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. William Brandham again. &gt;&gt; There's nothing to fear. He always wondered. He wondered if there'd be like a a mist go by and he wondered if that's brother Neville and he wouldn't have a hand that I could shake cuz his hand is there in the grave and and rotted away. But here they're not in the tomb. They're not in a grave. They're living person. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Another body. &gt;&gt; He told you about the body and he told you about the place. He's not a God of the dead. &gt;&gt; He's a God of the living. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said some other words, whatever you do, don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Let's pray for one another. We don't want to miss it. &gt;&gt; What shall a man do if he gain the whole world &gt;&gt; and lose his own soul? What do you want? Never want to miss it. If you're here, young person and hanging in the balance, don't hang any longer. &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Cast the world aside. Cast all your ambitions aside. &gt;&gt; Cast all your wants and all your uh whatever it might be. Just cast it aside &gt;&gt; because there nothing is worthy of missing that moment. &gt;&gt; I've had people say to me, "Well, I I'll just, you know, I'll I'll go through the great tribulation. If you can't stand now, you'll never stand then." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. [Music] Can I close with some potent words, please? He's talking about everything of Christianity and those that claim. He said, "Now it's began to pull away. The wheat has begun to be seen. This is not a Pentecostal age. &gt;&gt; This is the latter day age. &gt;&gt; This is the bride age. &gt;&gt; This is the evening light. &gt;&gt; This is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern. &gt;&gt; This is Luke 17:30 to be fulfilled. This is the book of Jeremiah and all the rest of them that Joel has spoke of these days. This is that day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've heard Lord that it was coming, but now I see it with my eye. &gt;&gt; See, the day might be this 20 might be this 24-hour period. I think of the people that, you know, they've they've seized upon a certain opportunity. Brother Brandham talks about the woman. Excuse me for taking just a few more minutes. He talks about the woman. I sat real close to him when he was talking about the woman that washed his feet with her tears. I have never seen such an expression of emotion. He was weeping so hard. His face was just reened, beat red. And he kissed his hand. And he was going depicting how she kissed his feet. friends, that was not what people regularly do when a guest, honored guest is invited for supper. &gt;&gt; She wasn't interested in what was proper &gt;&gt; and what was right. &gt;&gt; I've seen people in a service &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God would fall upon them &gt;&gt; and they might do something irregular, &gt;&gt; but it was so pure. It was so holy &gt;&gt; and everybody knew it was God because that person would never do such a thing if if they in their own in their own self. This woman brother Ben Brandham describes he said she saw him sitting there. She saw him with dirty feet. She saw him unwelcomed and she said this isn't right. Somehow it's not right. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I was in a church, even if I was the pastor of a church and they had zero interest and they fought against and resisted anything uh any effort, any attempt to speak to others or to let others or to translate the message or to use any means possible, whether it be cleaning the tapes as we were all these years ago and duplicating them and making even making cassettes so we could put the prophet's words on and sending them out over the radio or sending them anywhere we could. My brother, my sister, if God blesses a life or blesses a church, he'll do it for that. If I wasn't amongst a group of people that believed in that, &gt;&gt; don't worry about you leaving me. I'd leave you. I'm interested in people that have the same vision and the same burden and the same zeal. &gt;&gt; Tell me what's wrong with zeal. &gt;&gt; I'm not asking you like an athlete to get up at 5 in the morning or 4 in the morning and be at the gym at 6:00 and work yourself out till you're in a total sweat and almost wasted of your energy and eat this kind of food to do that. Not today and not this week, this month, this whole year. and maybe years of your life. Listen friends, this isn't a myth. This isn't a story. Vancouver's full of them right now. &gt;&gt; And people who put an incredibly more importance on some fleshly natural uh uh pride. I don't know what it is. I'm not opposed to them. I'm just saying that we as believers, &gt;&gt; we as believers, we have a greater cause. &gt;&gt; We have a greater reward. We have a greater call. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm going to close now, but I'm going to close with this statement. Brother Brandon went to great lengths to describe for the people that God chooses a person or he may choose an individual to be a channel and then he describes how a prophet is even born in a certain way &gt;&gt; because he is a channel. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the last two, three services, I've used the phrase the prophet channel, &gt;&gt; not a history channel, not a discovery channel, but a prophet channel. &gt;&gt; And you have to you have to turn it and get onto that channel. &gt;&gt; And God raised up a prophet who was the channel &gt;&gt; and people could say what they wanted to say. And they did &gt;&gt; and people used him &gt;&gt; and people abused him. But it never changed the channel. &gt;&gt; People resisted it. People blackened his name. They tried to do everything to destroy him and to destroy the work. Hey, we were here a handful of people. I know what it's all about. I'm telling you. I'm telling you with all my heart. We were here eight or 10 people sitting on rough unplained planks for benches on blocks of wood and I was the president of a company. I was respected by banks as an appraiser and yet and my and my on Sunday and and Tuesday and on Friday we're sitting there with young people, &gt;&gt; former drug addicts and whatever more. You've heard them testify. And I sat there because I believed in this message. &gt;&gt; And I believed that the message was the only thing that could change these young people. &gt;&gt; And we sat there with a handful of people. &gt;&gt; Eight or 10 people. All I can tell you is if I had to do it again, I'd do it exactly I would do it again. &gt;&gt; God was in it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of them heard it in school, didn't they, Karen? &gt;&gt; I'll never forget. You've seen Sister Karen. You know what she is. I just Sister Karen came with Joanne into our home, walked in a pair of jeans. I'm not saying that to embarrass her. That was a thing for young ladies to do. She's in a pair of jeans, sat at our table, and I just began to speak to her and went right into the serpent seed. Wasn't me that revealed it. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; not of yesterday. &gt;&gt; She begin to realize there's a God. &gt;&gt; There's a living person. &gt;&gt; This Bible says something that's relevant now. &gt;&gt; Not back there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just feel a pull. I feel a real strong pull. And I know I know that you would never dispute or you wouldn't even disregard the fact that the prophet's a channel. &gt;&gt; But do you know what he said? &gt;&gt; He said you, &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ, is the channel. &gt;&gt; You are now the channel. &gt;&gt; His voice is still and he is not here, but you are here. God's a God of the living. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you are the channel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're the one to whom it's committed &gt;&gt; this gospel &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. Live it, speak it, &gt;&gt; present it, however. But God has chosen you &gt;&gt; and he's said further &gt;&gt; that you're the voice, &gt;&gt; the final voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; The final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age. [Music] &gt;&gt; Why do you teach, brother Phillip? Do you expect the students to hear you? You expect them to remember what you've studied and prepared for them? I would hope so. And I would hope that your students would do that and be benefited. That's what teachers do. &gt;&gt; That's what preachers do. &gt;&gt; I believe Philip believes it. I believe Brother Terry John. I believe Sister Ramon and Sister Jenny. believe that they I believe that ministers &gt;&gt; and we don't want to ever get to be the place where he says and I said a little while ago, oh my oh my, I hope you stay with me just a few more moments. I'm going to close. But he said preachers will preach for a bread ticket &gt;&gt; for a living. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so they fit the gospel &gt;&gt; to fit their situation. &gt;&gt; That's not what we're here for. &gt;&gt; We study the word, the whole word, the whole council of God, and bring it to the people. This is what has been said. This is a message for this hour. And now we're preaching it not just to live somehow a better life. We want to show the scriptures that have unfolded and the scriptures that are being unfolded as of this time and what he said the bride is. Then I want to say to you this is what she is. &gt;&gt; What he said the bride will do. I want to repeat it. This is what the bride will do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whether I see it or whether I feel it is irrelevant. &gt;&gt; This is what she will do. &gt;&gt; You will do it &gt;&gt; as a people. You will do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thank the Lord for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So everything that God has spoken his word received into the right channel. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Will &gt;&gt; Amen. will materialize that word. [Music] &gt;&gt; The promise of God, &gt;&gt; not in theology, but the promise of God in the right channel. &gt;&gt; I'm closing, friends. He has declared &gt;&gt; and there cannot be a higher authority. &gt;&gt; There's never been a voice so vindicated as this voice. God, how can we forget? How can we even even question it? It says, "And they doubted back there." And so we're not doubting. &gt;&gt; We're saying, "Lord, I believe &gt;&gt; this is a scripture for this day. &gt;&gt; If you will hear his voice &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; if you will hear his voice, &gt;&gt; harden not your heart." So he has said the channel is the bride of Jesus Christ and the promise of God in the right channel &gt;&gt; will cause that promise to materialize. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I say this is the right word. &gt;&gt; It came by the right messenger. &gt;&gt; It came in our day. &gt;&gt; It came for this people. And we are that people. &gt;&gt; We've been called out &gt;&gt; and we responded &gt;&gt; and we were married to him. &gt;&gt; We are the channel. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Friend, what is the wife of a husband for? &gt;&gt; She's the channel &gt;&gt; for his seed. &gt;&gt; She receives his seed &gt;&gt; and she brings forth his image. And the prophet said further, that's why she was given to the husband to the man that she might bring forth his seed &gt;&gt; or his image. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Said if she would refuse his seed, &gt;&gt; she should be put away. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? Because she refusing to bring forth his image. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why it says, "Harden not your hearts &gt;&gt; as it was in the day of the provocation." &gt;&gt; In other words, open your heart. Open the womb of your mind. Say, "God, what you're speaking, I believe it. &gt;&gt; I haven't figured it out, but I believe it. &gt;&gt; I may not understand it, but I believe it." &gt;&gt; And the promise of the word in this channel will cause it to materialize. &gt;&gt; Say, "I I want I need a deeper life in Christ. I need to be changed. I need to be transformed. That's what this word came to do. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for taking up so much time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand, shall we? &gt;&gt; I thank you for your sincerity and I thank you for allowing me this time. &gt;&gt; You forgive me &gt;&gt; if I need to be. I want to sing a happy song. I want to sing a song that is from the scriptures. This is the day &gt;&gt; that the Lord hath made &gt;&gt; and we will be glad &gt;&gt; and rejoice in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I never forget. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I I wish I could have him here today. He's gone on. He's probably singing and dancing. Brother Eddie Layman. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; From South Africa. How many remember when he sang it? I can't re I can't duplicate that. But he just danced his way across the platform back and forth. This is the day. This is the day that the Lord hath made. Start me off, brother Derek. Everybody can sing. This is the day. This is the day that the Lord has made. That the Lord has made. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] the Lord. We will be glad. This is the day. This is the day that the Lord has made. That the Lord.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'd like to sing a verse of uh Joel's army, [Music] sons of God.

You all have, I'm sure. &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful sight, isn't it? Well, the prophet of God, he preaches watchmen one of the night and he tells us tells you tells me the evening star that was here in the evening time. &gt;&gt; This this very one that was here was the evening star. &gt;&gt; And then he says in another place, the evening star and the morning star are the same star. They're the same star &gt;&gt; and one's announcing that the evening is here. &gt;&gt; That's why the evening and the morning &gt;&gt; was the first day. &gt;&gt; Evening and the morning. &gt;&gt; And in the evening time, &gt;&gt; we had an evening star. Declared a message for the evening time. &gt;&gt; But before the resurrection came, he had to announce &gt;&gt; the sun is rising. [Music] That's the message we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We're going to have a glorious time this afternoon and evening around the communion table. Dear Lord Jesus, your people, such pure hearts, pure spirits, oh God, such keen desires, such a hunger. And you said, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness. They shall be filled." Lord, let the people be filled to overflowing. And may they have a a a rest and refreshment now this afternoon, returning back at 4:00, Lord, as we gather around your table and hear some exhortation. And we're coming, oh God, to remember this hour that you have given us. Bless the people. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're dismissed in Jesus name. I'll let you go your way. We've been a little longer than we should be. So I appreciate that and try not to do that next Sunday. God bless you. You're dismissed. See you this evening. Don't miss the Lord's table. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music]
