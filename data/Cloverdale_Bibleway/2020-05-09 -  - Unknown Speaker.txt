TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] coming home the other night or the other day or just for come home I was fell into a vision and I seen some little fellas theme look like young boys or something head on cat and we were standing hunting and I'd shot a mammoth big brown looking bear and then they turned around and said to me said but there's some confusion about the meeting I said no matter what the confusion is if I suppose go wherever it was I'll go anyhow see it doesn't matter in the vision stop I don't know where that's at but this is on Katie it's going to happen just remember it's going to happen Division on one of the trips we had just arrived and made camp and brother brothers Southwick said Blaine why don't you and Billy Paul and brother Ed go this direction and I and brother branham will will will go up the mountain just behind us here and I think that he wanted to do that because on the first day of the hunt he wanted to build take brother Brent a little bit easier and he wanted a little easier for himself as well because he had you know suffered a wee bit with that in China so they were going to take it easier and we made our way down the valley and then up into another little valley and we just climbed up on a bench and there was a giant bear coming down the other side of this valley not far from us and he was making his way and we kind of positioned ourselves behind some willows I never saw a bear like this before or since and he was quite dark very large and right from behind his ears and Overhill over his hump and on his down his cape down his breast like so he was just the color of golden wheat I never saw a bear like that it was the most magnificent thing and large and he was turning over stones and looking for ants and things that maybe rodents and so on and he's making his way down and I know that Grizzlies are very poor sighted but they're hearing and and especially their smell is so accurate we don't know that world at all but God has given them that and he when he walked out to there where the hills turned into this valley and he just across from us and Billy Paul and brother Blaine and myself we got down in the Willows there was just small willows there and we were watching this bear and he came down and he was across from us he was probably four or five six hundred yards across the mouth of this little Valley it was I started like a wash from a basin and we were watching him and the other brothers thought I should try a shot at it and I said no I wouldn't do that I said brother branham hasn't fired a shot yet that I know of I said I wouldn't want to do that we didn't know had not connected it with the a vision brother branham had had on a large big brown bear and this was him and we watched him for probably half an hour and then I saw that bear and he just put that giant head up into the air in the wind and he he was a tossed his head back and forth and he was trying to get our scent and then he just went like this and looked straight across the valley at us and then he wheeled around and started on a gallop and and straight up this mountain I timed him it was probably 1012 minutes and it went right right over the top of this mountain up into the glacier and his big paws and we were watching in the glasses and he ran right over the top of this mountain and disappeared that day brother Billy Paul had gotten a caribou and I also got a caribou later in the afternoon and the next day was just cloudy stormy weather and a rained and it was cold and that night and the next day and the next day and the next day four days we were locked into the tent and I heard brother South wake he kinda came by because I was kind of the point man and arranged the hunts and what the food and not things you know organized for the hunt and so he kind of it just came by me said I think brother branham wants to go home all I said you know that was a shock to me I couldn't believe that he wanted to go home we hadn't really started the hunt in earnest so I said to brother Brennan why I said but the Branum do you do you want to go home all he said we've had a wonderful hunt I said but you haven't even fired a shot he said well that means I can come back next year and he took it so nicely and and I felt I felt kind of downhearted that to me it hadn't been completed and it was raining and cloudy and clouds were hanging low and it was cold it was just very miserable weather so bud started to pack up things and make ready to go and it was I was feeling quite down cast and we had the horses outside and now I'm starting to put the panniers on them and this is quite a lengthy process probably take two and a half three hours and I was outside with my horse and brother Brennan he came up and he said brother anywhere was it that you saw that bear and I said well I pointed down the valley I said it's right down here and where those that little valley comes in to this one I said oh you just turn left and he'd go right up in there and he was right on that bench of the mountain and he said how long are we going to be so we asked bud how long are we going to be all he said you have lots of time you just take your time and Odin and you know you've got a lot of time probably a couple of hours yet so brother branham just disappeared and no those short willows and he was gone and and brother bud carried on and I was standing with my horse and we were in our rain here and this was really remarkable and then finally I got all on my horse and I was sitting on my horse and brother branham about an hour and a half or two hours later he came out he he'd been out he'd actually been alone with God I believe and he came out and he came up right beside my horse and this is what happened to me this is what I heard and this is my testimony and he said put his finger up he said this was on account of me he he said and some people might be offended with this but this is what he said I'm the Jonah in this group he said I knew I should have been with you little fellows he said that's the only time I know that I've disobeyed a vision only twice only twice they're like no one I've disobeyed a vision and he said like this was the second time and he said but he said that this is over and will ride out of here dry dry the leaves on the bushes were just labeled with rain and wet and if you just went a few meters few yards into the woods because there were short willows but if you would just go a few yards you'd be soaking wet and I was just I was bewildered I didn't know what to say I didn't know how to respond and I just sat there and I was sitting there about maybe 10 minutes and pondering the words that I've just heard but we'll drive we'll ride out of here dry it's over he said it's over and we'll ride out of here dry so all I knew is that whatever disappointment there was or he'd settle something with God or whatever I wasn't questioning I didn't try to figure things out I just knew it was over and in about ten minutes not more than 10 12 15 minutes at the most there was a puff of air warm air that just kind of blew by by me and I thought why that was not that was nice warm air and I we hadn't felt that for a number of days and just a little puff of hair and then a little while later there's a little breeze and the leaves were shaking and I noticed uh probably 20 30 yards or meters in front of me a sudden the Sun was shining just a big round spot where the Sun was shining that probably I looked up there was a hole in the sky and I was looking at blue sky and the Sun was shining straight through there on the ground and a little warm breeze was just like a Hawaiian breeze was blowing just dog lovely little breeze and the leaves were shaking and before our horses took the first step it was hot sunshine I took off rain gear that I had on and we rode out of there in our shirt sleeves and it was very warm weather and we rode all the way home about eight hours in perfect sunshine and just a lovely day you couldn't have had a more picture-perfect day than that day and we just rolled out dry I want to say to the viewers if we'd wrote out wet you wouldn't be hearing this testimony we wrote out dry that's what he said and that's exactly what happened and I want to give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ the people and many people don't understand some don't think well it's not fulfilled etc I would like to I have a couple of slides here that we'd like to refer to and I'd like to quote this is in September 1962 after the hunt and it's in the message countdown brother Branham says so I in these thirty going on thirty two years of ministry I have tried to stay just read it out of the Bible is that just what the Bible says and let it go like that and so I haven't had to take back or rearrange because I just said it the way that the Bible says it and I find out if God has spoken anything then we must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled we've seen that as I told you last I have a vision just recently that if I had to be there and warning to be there and telling me six months before to be on that spot and standing there saying go down there three times with them I just walked on with the other man and the vision passed right through exactly God's part I was there standing so we want to remember you've got to stay on the word stay right with the word where the word lead you go right with the word and you bring out all right I'm sure and that that for my part is the absolute solution and to the vision I I'm just sorry that a lot of people either don't ask their pastors or they don't research it in the message and then some just speak presumptuously that's without authority of any kind they don't have any super national authority they don't have the attendance of the angel of the Lord and they go ahead and say that brother Branham spoke presumptuously well I can I can declare he did not he spoke with great authority and great clarity and furthermore I was right there it never belittled her to me him when he said this is on account of me never occurred to me that that it made less of him I always thought it was great it was greater that he could actually say it this is on account of me I mean that I didn't want to be selfish but the fact that we wrote of dry and the weather changed I said what kind of man is this you know that speaks of the wind and the waves and speaks to the storm and the clouds and what is this what's God doing for me you know I always thought that it was just beyond beyond what was almost necessary you know that we that we that I I would be privileged to experience that and hear it and baffled me that people would find that as a reason to disbelieve I thought what in the world is going through their minds I just I can't even understand that today I just can't understand it he just lived lived it lived a full life of the Lord Jesus Christ whether it was whether it was in honor or whether he was admitting that he wasn't standing where he should be as he said in the message and he told it right publicly to the people and you have to be standing were you standing with the word if it's to be fulfilled and then it'll be all right [Music] you [Music]
