TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] he I have AER and [Applause] [Music] I and Before Time begin my life in his hands oh he know he knows my he knows he know [Music] my AR you glad that he know [Music] thank you [Music] Lord oh I'm so glad you [Music] know he knows my that's our God Allelujah we'd be a sad group of people we didn't have that confidence that kind of a God to come to amen are you happy happy you're a Believer amen that's wonderful I want to make a couple of uh announcements and uh sometimes these things aren't immediately understood right at the beginning but sometimes as a pastor you have to just ask for things to be done in a certain way and uh I've noticed that you know over the years from being a small Church we've always had written requests and requests have come up and we've taken time to read them and and as time goes on the requests become more and more and more and more and more more detailed and sometimes difficult to get to all of them and I whenever I have a a question come up my mind I always just go back to the message and listen to what happened in the prophet services and they just didn't do it that way and so I'm not going to I'm going to ask that we refrain from written requests that expect to be read I know that that you know for some say well I want the whole congregation to know but that's wonderful I mean I'm glad you have that kind of a burden but the thing to do is and what they did do is they brought aprons and they brought handkerchiefs they brought cloths and if you want a loved one prayed for or you want something special done you bring that and and the minister will lay hands on it here and that's what they did in the meetings and I think that's the pattern we need to follow and otherwise it just goes on and we have announcements about this and announcement about that and and we take up a lot of precious time that can be taken for the word of God and not that these aren't important they're very very important then if there's a something really critical and Urgent a a written request that's fine that's what we want to take time for or or or someone that uh we we get testimonies as well and we read this testimony read that testimony that's lovely but I think if we have a testimony and you want to thank the Lord for it and then people will get in the habit of just writing it out and putting it on the notice board and let people stand there and read it and rejoice with you otherwise you know we we just take up a great deal of time service after service after service and I just feel to follow the pattern that the prophet of God had in his meetings is that all right I trust you can say Amen to that and and uh next Sunday next Sunday evening we're not going to have a service we're cancelling next Sunday's regular service and the reason for that is we need to have a meeting of all of those in the congregation that feel that they would like to contribute or at least make themselves available to contribute a volunteer time for the upcoming conference in in July we need we need to have that meeting we need to actually have it urgently so we want to have that meeting next Sunday evening and I think maybe 5:00 will be all right too brother Tom we'll just meet at 5: and uh here are the areas that uh we we will have team leaders appointed but here are the areas that we will be needing assistance with uh number one with accommodation and in the accommodation we have an A and B portion of that and one is there will be buting that'll be taking place in homes that involves having a a list of homes and what each home can accommodate and uh uh and and then matching people to those homes that's very involved it takes a lot of time secondly under abating under accommodation will be the people that will be going to hotels some ministers are going to Hotel some people will want to make their own arrangements and so even to let them know now we've got a website that's already up and uh brother Darren and some of the brothers working with him we have a website that is 2007 convention and it's a beautiful website and that is for people anywhere in the world that can click on they can get the accommodation and list of the hotels Etc but we have a lot of ministers from different parts of the world and North America that we are uh assisting and working with and looking after so that's the accommodation and even though we have a team leader in the accommodation he's going to need several people to assist him and then under transportation and we have two areas of Transportation there will be ministers that'll be scattered throughout the area and people and we want to be able to have arrangements made so that those people those that are in private residences that we will have perhaps one one person with a a van or one person with a car all right these are your responsibility and and here's the meeting times and these pastors will need to get you know to the church at 9 in the morning get back or have uh some lunch whatever and these will be your responsibility so that is why we will be using a lot of different bodies but there'll be people who will be in charge who we need to have held responsible and then uh also transportation from the various hotels and so on uh because of the international nature of of this area and of this church there are people coming from many many different countries and the immigration the immigration requirements are not the same as they were before 911 the the reality is Everything's changed and you that cross the border back and forth you're well aware of that and we have brothers from different countries in fact is as far as canidate concerned we are requiring people to have visas now that did not require visas just a few years ago and so they have to apply to get visas sometimes they can wait for weeks or months to get a visa and we're only a few months away from the convention right now and it's it's nothing we understand brother Tony was telling me that a someone from India waited I think seven months and never did get the visa in time for the meeting so we have that to consider and uh and and this is not this is not a service we'll provide but we want to assist people and perhaps direct them to the right to the right uh Department also with some of the ministers we I have been writing and we've been for the last week and a half we've been sending out letters from the church office with invitation and these kind of invitations are just so that you know what we have to go through I just want to share it with the congregation we don't just sit in the office you know and and send out little notes uh we get we get word back from one of the consulate one of the Canadian consulate office wants to wants uh want the in official information of the church uh the our society status they want our bank account they want our financial statement because we have to take full responsibility for some of these people and our invitation say that we will look after this individual their complete accommodation uh their food and any medical needs that they might have while they're in this country that's what we have to assume when we invite uh uh the ministers especially that are coming so it's a it's a it's a big thing and we just can't take all the calls in the office so we need people to assist us in that and the next thing will uh involve some of the uh perhaps some of the sisters maybe with people like our brother Raymond young uh we need people that can take responsibility with the feeding we're not going to feed everyone but but we are going to have perhaps at least two ministers luncheons if not three and so I I am determined to allow the ministers to have as much time together so they're not just passing each other in the hallways I want the ministers from Brazil to meet the ministers from the Philippines and and the brothers from India to meet the brothers from the Ukraine and so on and I think that is a very very important thing and uh right now we have uh Brethren who have already notified us and this is uh we're way ahead but Brother G rald from bebber Germany will be coming brother Harold hilderbrand from Edmonton is the usually they have a convention in in in July and they have cancelled their convention this year to join with us in the convention here brother Tim Dodd from Grand Prairie brother Donnie Reagan is coming with we have brother uh brother uh Moses coming from India and several Brothers probably six or more from Brazil that want to come but we have to get the they have to get their documents together as quickly as possible uh and we want to have these brothers together as as much as possible then we have the internet streaming services the that F that uh internet streaming of the live services and and uh we have the Brethren who are in charge of that but they will need all kinds of go for people and and assistance uh then we have in the missions Department to work with brother Tony and brother Derek Paris uh there's a lot to do with regards to the missions and we need uh we need brothers and sisters also that will be able to assist in those areas and we just need to we may not be able to use everybody but we we want to be able to say here's an opportunity and the reason why we like to get all of these things looked after and get them really cared for by people who are fully responsible to see it move ahead is because uh I personally want to have my mind just on the ministry part who's going to minister and the services and I just like to be completely given over to that and I'm sure that you understand that uh you may want to just chart these down if you're interested uh Pastor Mundo in Ottawa is having the dedication of their Church uh is the sixth 7th and eth of April so that's next month and I think he may even have the meetings earlier he may be starting them as early as the 3D I don't have an official announcement but we've been speaking on the phone and I do know that the 8th Sunday the 8th is the official dedication time for the church this church is really quite unique and it has gained the attention of uh of a lot of shall I say uh decision makers and people in government in in some fairly high places I understand right to the uh prime minister of Canada himself they're very interested in this church because it has been built by largely new Canadians immigrants to Canada and it's kind of one of its kind it it's like something that's never happened before and I understand members of parliament plan to attend and there's a possibility the Prime Minister himself will attend uh some City counselors are planning to attend attorneys and different people well that's fine I I'd be happy if they want to come and hear the hear what the message is all about but uh brother Mundo would like us to pray especially he you can understand the position that he's in and he wants us to really pray for those uh that dedication I will be speaking the dedication meetings on the 8th on Sunday the 8th on May the 26 27th and 28 is in bezburuah was having the pent Pentecost special at that week and July the 20th the 21st and the 22 that's just after our convention brother Roy Shrewsbury is having dedication of their church I had a l lengthy conversation with him yesterday and uh one of the things you know he wasn't talking about the construction of the church so much in fact as we hardly talked about it at all uh he'd like us to pray for sister Shrewsbury she's been in the hospital about two weeks over two weeks 18 days uh with uh with pneumonia and you know she just uh quite up in years and she's very very frail but what a trooper what a soldier she is she she she had been home and and just a frail little person and when we went down there last time she wanted to come to church and she sat at the orgon and played the whole service and came back at night and played I didn't know she was even capable of sitting up that long and I just said you know God bless people like that that spirit is so fervent even though the flesh is weak the spirit is Welling and uh so we want to remember our sister shrewbury brother shrewbury he is held he's stood right by the doctors and they told him your wife is dying he said she can't she can't die because God has given her as a help meat and I'm not done with her and I still need her and uh he said she's going to come out of here and she's going to live and that's been a probably three years ago and every time she goes in they think she's going to die and and until brother shrewsbury's done she's just not going to go he told me that there was a man that came to know the Lord Jesus in the light of this message at their church I think probably in the last year that man when he was four years old had a diseased eye and they actually took his eye out he said his eye was hanging down on his cheek while they operated uh back in the eye socket of his left eye and he was not able they were not able to regain his sight and he'd been absolutely blind since he was 4 years old in the last few weeks I guess it was they had had a a meeting brother shrewbury felt led to have a 3 weeks of meeting and just one of his lay ministers that assists him I understand was speaking the meeting and I don't know what all happened but the brother was prayed for and uh his name is Tony and he was prayed for and he lives about 15 miles from the church and after the service he and his wife and either his mother or his wife's mother they were in the car car and he's driving and he said I can see out of that eye and he said you know what I'm going to do I'm going to stop and I'm going to put a patch over my over my good eye and they of course his wife and uh mother-in-law got real nervous you're going to drive you know with that eye and he put a patch on his good eye and drove 15 miles home I say praise be to God hallelujah and brother Shrewsbury said he had him just in the meeting the other day stand up he says stand up brother Tony brother Tony stood up in the meeting he said I want you to cover your good eye which he did and he said now I want you to count my fingers how many fingers do I have up how many fingers do I have up he said he could see just fine I say praise be to God hallelujah that's a great encouragement to the church our God is a god of Supernatural things and if we can just believe only believe Hallelujah he does know our name doesn't he why don't we stand maybe we can just sing that chorus again [Music] Linda He Knows My Name aren't you glad he know my every [Music] here's the main one when I call he knows my he knows my he SE hears me when I in a moment of prayer we want to approach him almighty God author of this word that I hold here in my hand just now we believe that you breathed the breath out of your very being and because you breathed prophets of old spoke men were inspired who assisted them and stood by them inscribed those words they've been preserved down through the centuries you sent your only begotten son and through our Lord Jesus Christ we have salvation redemption and forgiveness of sins and today we say Lord without any any hesitation forgive us our wrong forgive for us our sins forgive us every wrong thought every wrong attitude and even now we lay it down before you we confess those wrongs that it might drop into the bleach of Jesus Christ and be annihilated we might stand as spotless as the driven snow we pray Lord you'll bless this congregation the visible congregation in this sanctuary and throughout this building of this place of worship pray that you will be with the invisible congregation Lord wherever they may be as we've heard this last week from different parts of the world and I pray oh God this service will be a blessing a strengthen lift up your people into the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Oh Lord let the Holy Spirit of divine revelation uh functionize us

are participating Lord in the sound and the video I pray you will anoint us for service in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you I'll invite you to take your bibles if you would please and turn to Second Kings uh 20th chapter nice to see you brother Lyall miss you also amen I'm going to begin to read at the 12th verse and we'll read down to the 18th verse at that time bod do baladan the son of baladan the king of Babylon sent letters and a present to Hezekiah for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and Hezekiah hearkened to them and showed them all the house of his precious things and the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armor and all that was found in his his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his do Dominion that Hezekiah showed them not then came Isaiah the prophet unto King Hezekiah and that is Isaiah of the book of Isaiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and Hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from Babylon and he said what have they seen in thine house what have they seen in thine house and Hezekiah answered all the things that are in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them and Isaiah said unto Hezekiah hear the word of the Lord behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried into Babylon nothing shall be left saith the Lord and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which Thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be unic in the Palace of the king of Babylon then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah good is the word of the Lord which thou Hast spoken and he said said is it not good if peace and Truth be in my days may God bless his word as you have your seats I'll really need you will need your full attention as the Lord I ask I ask the Lord to take and assist me very very much in this service I spoke last week on being impress impressed by Revelation and how we are impressed by different things and when we are impressed it it uh causes a an action or a reaction within us uh we're all impressed with something or someone and sometime we may become impressed uh very suddenly something we just see momentarily we become impressed with it and other times other things impress us over a long period of time but what we are impressed with impressed means to be left with a mark from a constant pressure that's put upon either the mind or the conscience or our our life some aspect of us and it can take place over a long period of time and then then we can also be impressed now impression Naturally Speaking happens when our senses are contacted something we see something we hear and I just mentioned very briefly and I want to be very brief in the summary you know people are impressed with art they're impressed with architecture they're impressed with great things or big things or they're impressed with music or musicians and and we can just any Myriad of things that people become impressed but if you are really impressed by something or by someone or by some character or something that you observe and I'm speaking about really being impressed that impression will leave an imprint on you and if if it's on a over a period of time it will actually shape your life until you become what you are impressed by now that is the that is the principle that is spoken of uh that I spoke of last Sunday but the when it comes to a spiritual impression and we went into what the prophet of God spoke about our conscious and our subconscious and it become very very evident that uh a Believer and then we need let me just preface that by saying and we need conditions for Revelation there has to be conditions the right atmosphere the right environment has to be present and when that when that does take place and the right environment the right conditions and you yield and submit yourself and uh Focus yourself and just in a relaxed State begin to receive the engrafted word of God that even bypasses our mental our conscious our conscious our mental our critical conscious and comes down into the soul then the Holy Spirit can bring back to remembrance the things that you heard at the appointed time and it begins to change and shape maybe it just be a thought you'll run into something next week and then something you heard and and you don't really realize it at the moment it's not in your conscious thought but it's something within you and it affects you it moves you it begins to direct your actions and actually you're being shaped by that which you receive from God through the word of God by the Holy Spirit you can say Amen to that coming through that subconscious last Sunday I made reference to the scripture and our scripture reading had to do with what the Apostle John had said concerning their time when they were following Christ and he said that which was from the beginning the things that we've heard and the things that we've seen the things that we looked upon and our hands of handled of the word of Life uh for the life was manifested and we seen it and we bear witness and we show it unto you and we declare it and and even after all of that we know that it was not what they heard and what they saw and what they had hands handled that actually revealed who Jesus Christ was to them because the scripture says flesh and blood and that's your flesh and blood and any preacher's flesh and blood and any parents flesh and blood or anyone else cannot reveal fully who Jesus Christ is now you can sit and hear the word as they heard it they heard it they pondered it but the Bible also tells us that that as they continued to follow on and then certain events took place then remembered they the word of the Lord so it was spoken they heard it but that did not do the revealing at the moment but as they had received it into a believing heart in Simplicity they received it and then they ran into something later on then they remembered what the Lord had spoken because now they were seeing it unfold unfold itself so there must be this added spiritual Dimension to even the things you hear this morning and that's why we pray God by the Holy Spirit cause these things to be a reality to me if if I don't need them now cause them to be a reality to me when I do need them may they be and may I be in a place may I be ready may I be available may I be yielded bring me in that place I think that it's absolutely critical that we keep that H at itude we may not be fully aware of the magnitude of what we are receiving until a later time I want you to think about that even what you're hearing now may say well that was rather simple and that may well be but we may not be aware of the magnitude of what we're hearing until a later time and then the holy ghost will bring to your attention or to your remembrance Jesus said John 14:26 but the comforter when which the which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things it's powerful all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you so he had said it he spoke spoke it but now he's saying the father will send the comforter the Holy Spirit and he's going to bring all things back to your remembrance of the things which I have said so when Jesus spoke it they were not able to receive the full revelation of what was said is that correct however the conditions the conditions for the Revelation were present they were followers we're following you wherever you lead we're following you in the good times in The Bad Times we're following you those are the conditions we're yielding whatever you say we'll do you tell us to go and get a donkey we'll go and get a donkey you tell us to go and get a an upper chamber we'll go and get an upper chamber you tell us to prepare tell us to go into the City and and buy victuals for the people whatever you say we'll do but they weren't under they didn't know it's going to be written in the scripture they didn't know that every move M was the word of God that was going to be written for centuries to come they didn't know that but the Holy Spirit would make these things real and that's what I say we do not know what the you don't know what the magnitude of your being here your life your testimony your words the very expression of Christ in you you don't know what portion that is playing in the overall Rapture you have no way of knowing that so you have no way of measuring the magnitud ude of what God is bringing and registering in your heart in the message God identifying himself and I believe I read this last Sunday Jesus was referring to Luke the 17th chapter and that's such a common scripture to us I don't want you just to glance over it and he says as it was reading he's quoting back to Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed and he says then when the Revelation is unfolding itself when the Revelation is unfolding itself in the days when the world will be like Sodom what will it be he said the characteristic of that scripture the characteristic of that scripture Luke 17:30 being fulfilled which is the Revelation unfolding itself God identifying himself by his characteristic characteristics that he's always been he cannot leave that in the last days he identified through his son I well I'm just be laboring this a we bit I want you to hang on to every word in the last days he said in the last days he identified through his son now the Revelation is unfolding itself you cannot make the revelation of God's word unfold itself it is a living seed and so it unfolds itself oh but there's another important aspect here go God just doesn't have his word unfolding itself and revealing marvelous things I have a question to whom to whom who is this for on whose behalf is this and what is the objective of God in doing this oh well I'll go to Galatians 3 uh 3:18 and 19 and now I'm just I'm just actually giving a little uh foundation for the service we've got a lot of hay on our Fork Apostle Paul says for if the inheritance be of the law if our inheritance and he's speaking to the Galatians if your inheritance your inheritance your spiritual inheritance he said if it be of the law Thou shalt Thou shalt not Thou shalt Thou shalt not he said then it is no more of promise if it's of the law and you do this and you don't do that and you do a whole lot of things if it's of the law if your inheritance is coming by the law then it's not by promise but he says but God gave it to Abraham by promise it was unconditional brother Brandon makes a point many times he says to Adam if you do this and I'll do this but but when it came to Abraham that is not what he said he said to Abraham I have done it it's already done you are going to be a father of Nations you are going to have a son the sun's coming by promise not by what you can achieve I'm giving you the sun isn't it wonderful to have an unconditional promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law he asked the question then what does the law serve it was added because of transgressions if there's no sign out there that says you know 30 m an hour you can go 50 but if it says 30 m an hour the law is added so that transgression can be identified then you go 50 you're guilty so that is just that simple it was added because of transgressions because uh people I won't want to get into it but people were simply transgressing they were even transgressing their own conscience and so God gave a law that would make the whole world guilty before him but he says now notice this wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions and here's the phrase till the seed should come to whom the promise was made the law was given the law was given so that transgression could be multiplied until the seed would come the people would come the elected would come to whom the promise had been made because until the promise the promise could be declared but if the people weren't there to whom the promise was given then uh then it's it's not a complete picture okay we we we'll just talk about a natural inheritance here uh a father and a mother than uh a young man young woman get married and they're they working hard and the children come into the family and they got little Junior in a crib and maybe another one crawling around and and so on and daddy he's working every day and bringing back and you know the feeding them and clothing them and all the rest of it and maybe putting a little savings away or gets a little house or whatever more who who who is that inheritance well it belongs those little ones crawling around but they don't know it and before they came on the scene Maybe daddy was already building a place but he was building it for for the children but they haven't even come yet you understand so the inheritance is their but they're not even on the scene yet but The Inheritance is for them and then when they come on the scene they are The Heirs of what Mother and Dad have it's just that simple and so God had great things in store for his children and he has and he has seed coming thanks be to God all down from generation to generation from season to season he has children coming and he's got promises time locked in this word of God that's for All Peoples of all time and there were promises for this day for this day and Luke 17:30 was one of those promises that was time locked for this day in the day when the son of man is revealed what day this day and that sat here for centuries but the children to whom the promise was made had not arrived and so it was it was absolutely essential that when the children arrived then the Holy Spirit begins to shine what he did through a prophet messenger shined upon that scripture and kept referring to it and referring to it and referring ref in to it and tens of thousands hundreds of thousands heard it but there were an elect group to whom the promise was made and they saw it and they couldn't see anything else they couldn't help themselves they saw it and it was it came by Revelation I can say all of those that have seen the revelation of Luke 17:30 the revealing of the son of man how did it come to you you didn't go to a school you didn't go to cat ISM you maybe heard a lot of sermons but you know that just comes like that you see it no one can shake that from you I tell you there isn't enough devils in Hell there isn't enough theological teachers there isn't enough books in the world to take that out of my heart what did we know what did you know about the scriptures what did you know about the rapture your process what did you know about the shout the voice in the trumpet before you heard the message big fat zero big fat zero until the message came what was it it was the promise was always there the Apostle Paul spoke it it show I show you a great mystery we do not all sleep but we'll all be changed Hallelujah we didn't know how we didn't have the word a sweep will go over us we had never heard will'll change in our atoms we had never heard in fact as we had the whole thing happening in the twinkling of an eye that's how twisted even intelligent men can become because there's nothing in the scripture says it'll happen in the twinkling of an eye it says we'll be changed in the twinkling of an eye but people put it and put the whole Rapture process then it comes a prophet starts putting it in order there'll be a voice there'll be a shout and the shout will be a message and that is to collect the living there'll be a voice and the voice is to collect the sleeping and there'll be a trumpet and that will be the sleeping and the living gathering together for we always gather at a trumpet when did you know that when did we know that well you know it now you know it now I'm asking do you know it now now my next question how did it come to you how did it come what channel did it come I'm not too sure that's the channel I'm talking about it's a channel that God created it comes down into the soul we don't know how it comes all we can say it it arrived Hallelujah it arrived it is so real amen what do you know about Revelation 10 before the message come did you ever have the emphasis on a I saw another Mighty angel coming down descending from heaven and then and and it's described the rainbows over his head and it's and his hair is white and his feet and then you you look into and then you just have you have a simple Simplicity of a prophet message say it's the same one in Revelation one he described exactly the same he's the same one and we looked at it we said of course what was that how did that come to us until the seed should come to whom the promise was made re reation was actually made for the children who should come until the seed should come to whom the promise was made Revelation 10:7 was made for us Revelation 101 was made for us it was spoken for us Thessalonians through the Apostle Paul was spoken for us you can set yourself off if you wish put yourself off in some Far Away place if you wish I put myself directly by God's grace under those promises this is to whom I'm part of that seed to whom This Promise was made and I say thanks be to God we've arrived Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit was on time and the Holy Spirit took those promises and said and gave them to the children say here they are children here they are how did we know the coming of the Lord was a process until the message came there's so much confusion out there talking about the coming of the Lord have no idea how it's going to happen here comes a prophet ler right out here's step one here's step two here's how it's going to happen here's the whole scene here's the message here's the word of God going back to the Jews it's so beautiful isn't it and because because you are Sons Apostle Paul says now he's revealing himself and because your sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son not into your head or into your mind but into your heart he sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father father we enter into a relationship with him and the prophet said he loved fatherhood I have a few uh slides I'm just going to show the first couple here and because you are sons all right all right there we are and because you're Sons God ha sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father brother brandham said he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way I want to stress that the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man and that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man now I want to get your attention here when Jesus stood here on Earth who was the son of man and God who fills all time and space Desiring because he said also in Christ The Mystery of God revealed that his great uh his great three-fold mystery was he wanted to reveal himself to the people now if you just try in your imagination for a moment is imagine this God the god that gave all life the god that created all the universe that's God and he wants to have a family he wants to enter into a relationship that he can't have with stars and planets and all of these things and and even an animal kingdom but he wants one like himself he wants to make himself known his great ambition then I make myself known in fact is if you go back to the Garden of Eden this is the very thing that Satan Satan got in the in the middle and and uh did everything he could to disturb that process of God making himself known and separated the people from him by Disobedience by sin and consequently by death which Jesus Christ had to undo that whole act am I making sense to you and so this God he wants to reveal himself so now comes the very uh the the very person ification of God God In the Flesh of Jesus Christ and he begins to manifest himself who he is and that he's got attributes of healing he has attributes of forgiveness he has attributes and he's making those known to the people God but the what what he was really doing above all of that Jesus goes down into the waters is baptized and a voice speaks goes up onto the mount Transfiguration and a voice speaks what it say this is my son you can see what's in the heart of God he didn't say this is a beautiful day this is a great moment in time you're a wonderful people this is a great nation of Israel he could have said a lot of things but of all the things that was in the bosom of God when he had his son plus he could say this is my son this is my son and as that son and he loved fatherhood so much that he wanted to have a son who would be in His image and also he knows that he's through that son he's restoring back all the other Sons to himself and so Jesus Christ as the son of man says to the people when you see the days of Noah return on a global scale and when you see the days of Sodom return on a global scale even so even thus shall it be in that day the son of man will be revealed now listen let me say to you it is obvious the only reason that Jesus would be saying that and the only reason that there would be a further Revelation or uncovering of the son of man would be because God the Father his father wants to wants to uh uh manifest or show something of the father son relationship that was not that did not happen at that time there will be a further revealing of the father son relationship and that further revealing is that now now oh my I just hope you can grasp it with me now it's not just a singular Jesus Christ but now it is a body of people that now what they have now which they didn't have then when Jesus was here he was here single singular in an individual body but in Luke 1730 in the fatherhood who love fatherhood part of that loving was there has to be more there has to be more than the individual Jesus Christ standing here on Earth there's got to be some more seed to whom the promise I give the promise of Luke 17:30 but the seed must come and they will be part of the family you know if Jesus stood right here on Earth in an individual unit of body and flesh he would be incomplete he was incomplete then and I hope you understand that he was incomplete in that there were others that were to come and that is why he said it's expedient for you that I go if I don't go the Holy Spirit can't come but when he's come he'll reveal the truth to you he'll speak of me can you say Amen you understand what I'm saying he'll speak of me and we are will'll be Sons and Daughters born of the spirit and born of the word and in that day when Luke 17:30 is revealed the even the father and this and the sunship will take on a whole new dimension because now we'll see really what that body of Christ is my time slipping away on us terribly now you can just turn the lights back on if you will please for a moment I've stated in the New Testament pretty well but there is a there is those that were had revelation Revelation is not exclusive to the New Testament Revelation was also in the Old Testament Abel it was revealed to him brother brandham says to bring a lamb in the message works as Faith expressed brother brandham speaks about Abraham and he said it was revealed to him he said he considered not his own body dead neither even considered it he said it wasn't even brought into a question whether whether God would do it or not God said it he would do it and he said it was revealed to him how did it come just like I asked you how did it come to you the scripture the promise that was being made to him in the case of Moses he said he had his foot on the throne and Moses chose rather to suffer with the people of God than to sit on the throne down there because it was revealed to him spiritually and here he was going and God was proving proving his word to him so it was revealed to Abel it was revealed to Abraham it was revealed to Moses and brother Brandon speaks about David and that's the last one I'll refer to he said he's standing there with a little piece of leather goat skin or sheep skin with two pieces of string tied to it but it was revealed to him by Revelation revelation and struck him and he said the god that took me out of the paws of the bear and the god that took me out of the paws of the lion how much more will he deliver that un uncircumcised Philistine into my hand whatever that Philistine is today it can be a cancer it can be some disease it can be some thing that has plagued you spiritually it can be some spirit that has hounded you and bound you you got to rise up either today tomorrow or sometime if you believe that you're a son or a daughter to whom the promise is made I said it's time that you arise and say all I got is a sling but I got a promise from God and this thing cannot stay here sometimes blessings and benefits continue on because God has been pleased with the life of another why do you think about that I read it several times in my studies sometimes God would even allow the entire Kingdom or we could say the entire church or we could say an entire family you here as young people you might say my oh we got a blessed family we just all I all I could really say is thank you Lord I Thank you but you may not know why that blessing is there I feel that we've been a blessed church and I cannot perhaps identify exactly why but I do know that God has blessed the assembly here and he's blessed individuals here he's blessed families here and and and you have allowed me to be part of the rejoicing with you and I Rejoice Hallelujah over the mighty things that God has done whereof we are glad and I hope we never lose that Thanksgiving Hallelujah and if we're not here because of that blessing of God and we ought to go somewhere else we're here because we believe that God has us here that you have a special place a special recognition and God has sent his promise to the elected seed until they should come and if you can't say anything else before you leave this place I want you to be able to say I am one I am one of the seed to whom the promise was made and thus I am here receiving the the benefits of that promise I want to hope that you can stay with me now I want to step back quickly to a King King Hezekiah and I'm going to move as quickly as I can now in the days of Solomon King Solomon he had a very competent a very very competent very industrious and a man of great Valor in his kingdom and his name was jobon he was he was the son of of one of his leading servants and he made him because he saw the kind of man that he was he was a young man the Bible calls him a young man and Solomon detected and saw what kind of a man he was and he put Jobo over his entire house over all all of his house and the Bible says that the man Jobo was a mighty man of Valor and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the House of Joseph and then Solomon's son was rabone so if you remember those rabom was Solomon's son and Jobo was a man that he had appointed a young man Jesus spoke of Solomon in all of his glory and the glory of his kingdom and we can only imagine the portion of trust that Solomon must have had in order to give all of this into jeroboam's hands so now we have some events that are happening and they're happening towards the end of Solomon's Ministry or Solomon's Reign Solomon now towards the end of his life because he had many wives and he also took wives of heathen Nations no doubt beautiful young women but he had hundreds of wives and the Bible says that the wives persuaded the heart of Solomon away from the Lord and to their idolatry and Idols the Bible says that King Solomon lived loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites and the ammonites the the zidian and and the Hittites and if you knew anything about the Hittites the Hittites were really a very very violent vicious Wicked people and of the Nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel you shall not go into them and neither shall they come in unto you that's simple isn't it you shall not go into them and you shall not you know I think of some of the things that God has spoken to us by by uh the prophet of God in this generation and it is so simple it's just that simple you don't do that and you don't go out there because if you do you'll be afflicted and you'll bring that world back in or you'll be afflicted yourself or whatever more they're just such simple things you should dress in a certain Manner and act in a certain Manner and live in a certain way it's not complicated it's not rocket science say Amen you know it's true just do it and so the Bible says that you shall not go to them they shall not come in unto you for surely surely they will turn away your heart from their your heart after their gods and Solomon clave unto these in love the last verse for it came to pass when Solomon was old excuse me terrible to get old when Solomon was old that his wives glad I just got one turned him away turn him away turn his heart away after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as was the heart of David his father and because of this because of this and because of this situation had Arisen at the end of his life I'm giving you background now to King Hezekiah because of this Jobo had a new garment on and he walked out into a field and was met there with the prophet of God AA and AKA was speaking to him and AKA took His Garment and rent it into 12 pieces and he gave Jobo 10 now that's not Solomon's son that's a young man of Valor and he gave him 10 pieces and said to him and he said to Jobo take these 10 pieces for thus sayth the Lord the god of Israel behold I will Ren the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give 10 tribes to thee but he shall have one tribe there's one missing he shall have one tribe that tribe was Judah for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel so here you're going to have 10 and and I'll leave one with David's son Solomon to reabo and he'll have one he'll have Jerusalem he'll have Judah and when Solomon died and riab his son became the king he was really very very foolish and very unwise because they he he he came with a Messengers and they approached riab and said your father was very harsh and put very strict uh uh heavy burdens on us and we ask you to lighten these burdens and the Bible tells us that uh rabom he took counsel from his young friends and his peers and they said put heavier burdens on them and so he went back and told him say my little finger is going to be as thick like my father's thigh or something like that and I'm going to put heavier burdens and so they they rebelled against uh they rebelled against re B and thus the prophet AA his prophecy was fulfilled and the nation was torn in two and the tribes of 10 tribes took Jobo as their King and they became the northern kingdom and rabom was left with one which was just Judah and it came to pass when Israel heard that jobon was come again that they sent and called him under the congregation and made him King over all is Israel and here's now where you want to keep your attention because I may have to come back to this but when we speak of Israel now in this service today we're not speaking of the nation of Israel we're speaking of the 10 tribes those 10 tribes were called Israel and the other tribe was called Judah and now now the lineage of the Kings of Israel split into two and there's two lists of kings that go on down and one are one is the Kings of Israel and the other is the kings of Judah now I needed to say that because Jobo was a very very smart cunning man not evil in that sense of the word because otherwise Solomon wouldn't have given him the responsibility that he gave him but right away Jobo says are you with me Jobo says in his mind ah if I let the people go to Jerusalem to worship if I let them go to Jerusalem for the Passover their hearts are liable to be swung into the allegiance of riabal and be swung back under rabom as king and I mustn't do that or I will lose their allegiance so what shall I do so he set up two golden calves he set up one at the North and he set up one at the south in bethl which was Mount Ephraim and one in the north which is Dan and so he could announce to the people aren't you lucky you have jerob as king you don't have to journey to Jerusalem anymore more I've localized the thing and you that are in the South you can worship in Ephraim and bethl and we got a golden calf down there and you lucky people who live in the North up and down you have a calf up there and you can worship there that became known as the sins of Jobo and it never left the children of Israel and the scripture says concerning the sins of Jobo because now it looked like a good idea it was a good political move but he got the people into idolatry and the Bible says if this people go up to do sacrifice to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again to their lord even unto rabam king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to rabom King of Judah so he took counsel and they made the two Cals and said to them it's too much for you to go to Jerusalem Behold thy Gods oh Israel now you know one of the challenges of a minister is when he's going from the Old Testament and you're sitting here saying how does that relate to us I can tell you that that same spirit is still very present and even more so today in and and trying to suggest to the people it's too much the message really requires too much for you you can have the same benefits you can have the same blessings you don't have to go to that extreme don't go down you don't have to go down to Jerusalem you don't have to do all of these things that that oh and then they began to compare themselves with themselves and say well they don't go down the the people in Dan they don't go down there what do we have to go down there for they don't dress like that what do we have to dress like that for I see what they do in another church I see what they do in another place I see what they're doing on the state side or I see what they're doing up in Edmonton or I see what they're doing that's not the Bible they're not our scripture say my friend your friend's not in the Bible as a book in the Bible it's not what somebody thinks it's not what somebody reasons it's not even what you think it's what God has [Applause] said and what do you want to do have have something easy here for just a breath and you're gone and then then eternity then what the other side then what in the presence of God then what Hallelujah and we've got this message as a incredible responsibility and and we are the seed to whom it came and Israel was God's chosen nation and now this nation that God chose as his own people it's Tor to and he's got one leader and he had a prophet say to him you're going to have 10 and he takes the 10 tribes and drags them into absolute idolatry and they're called the sins of Jobo and here's just the scripture and he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jobo Kings 14:16 First Kings 15:30 because of the sins of Jobo which he sinned in which he made Israel to sin Kings 16:31 and it came to pass as if they had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jobo 2 Kings 3:3 nevertheless he clave under the sins of jobon 2 Kings 10:31 and jahu there's much read about J was a fast driver and he took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord for he departed he he he departed not from the sins of Jobo 2 Kings 13:2 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord and followed the sins of Jobo 2 Kings 13:11 and he did that with which was evil in the sight of the Lord and He departed not from the sins of jerbo and and 2 Kings 14:24 and he these are all different Kings all different people all different leader and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord and He departed not from the sins of jerbo and second Kings 15:19 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord and his fathers and and had done and departed not from the sins of jerbo we're walking all through centuries of time and this what this one man did and it goes on right right on to the end of Kings 17 and 22 for the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jobo which he did they departed not from than brother brandham in the church ages he comes right to the end and he reads uh Deuteronomy 2916 to 20 which I won't take the time but you can write it down and God is saying to the people this is kind of a lesson are you able to follow me are you alert enough to follow me I put a lot of prayerful prayerful time into this and God said for you know how you have dealt dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we come through the Nations which you passed by and you have seen their Abominations he's talking to his people now I'm going to say to this congregation we've passed by a lot of denominations and we have come through many of these lands and we've seen how they believe and how they worship and we see what it produces and we want no part of it but if we tamper with it or if we mingle with it you will be affected am I making a point and he said lest there should come lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord your God to go and serve other gods of these other nations lest there should be any among you a root that beareth GA and wormwood and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that He blesses himself in his heart saying I will have peace I have people who have heard the message heard it declared absolutely and say well you know I talked to one right outside in the foe I said if you go this direction you might be able to keep yourself you might be able to keep yourself but you'll never keep your children your children will not follow this not go in this direction and it was a sad tale it was a sad tale that person lives in sin today gross sin and lost one of the children by Suicide died at 14 years old and the last time I told this someone didn't even like me saying it I tell you what God would have said it in the Bible because it's the truth and they don't want to hear that a man of God stood there and said but your children will not they'll not remain you might be able to hold some status cuz you're already set in your ways but they will go a different direction and some say well I don't think that's so and I had him say it to me I don't think that's so and I said to this individual be it known to you your God is not my God Amen your God is not my God I don't serve of your God your God that tells you these kind of things that tell you perverted things concerning the message that God's not my god listen friends I'm going to say some things I've proven this God and this God is a living God this God hears us this God sees us and he sees exactly where we are sees what we do he knows all about us and I'm glad he's a righteous God I'm glad he's a holy God says the Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall be upon him and the Lord shall blot his name and here's what brother Brandon was stressing want the congregation to hear it and the Lord shall blot his name from under the heavens and I read for you the sins of Jobo and he walked in the sins of Jobo and he walked in the Sin the sins of jobal Simply where that he turned the hearts of the people because of his own insecurity because of his own he wanted to secure his position he so he got the people and he brought them it looked like such an innocent thing he brought them and here you have 10 tribes and they went into idolatry up and down and down in Ephraim I invite you to go home and read the 144,000 in the Book of Revelation and of the tribe of Asher 12,000 and of the tribe of GAD 12,000 of the tribe of nap 12,000 of the tribe of this and of the tribe of that two tribes are missing their names became blotted out Dan and Ephraim are not there the sins of Jobo carried all the way forward and those two tribes and a prophet brings it and says I'll blot his name out and their names are blotted out you know we're in a very very wonderful age may my help me we're in a very wonderful age and you have freedom of thought and freedom of worship and freedom of a whole lot of things but I'll tell you God is not some he's not some pansy God says something and that's what he means God asks us to do something and he may not force us but he asks us to do it and you'll be blessed if you do it and you will not be blessed if you don't and there are some things a person can do and come right under a curse of God and that I wouldn't want to have for anything now let me just can I take about another 10 15 minutes and then I'm I'm going to close Hezekiah King Hezekiah was the 13th King down from riabal right down to number 13 there have been all these Kings before him and his own father his name was ahaz and the Bible says that ahaz that's hezekiah's Daddy was 20 years old when he came and became king and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem and he did that which was not right in the sight of the Lord like David his father and he made molten images and I'm giving it brief now now I've come on down to show how it all happened and now I've come down to the Hezekiah himself but I want to just give you a little bit of a picture a little window of his daddy king ahaz who was 20 and he made molten images to balum and he burnt incense in the valley of hom and he burned his children in the fire wouldn't some of you kill want to be his son after the Abominations of the Heathen whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel so now he's doing exactly what the other Heathen Nations that were cast out now he's doing it and he sacrificed also burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every Green Tree now as I go through this we have such a large contingent of young people here and you are I have a lot of Hope and confidence I'm in the Twilight time you're just in the rising of your strength and your beauty and your homes and what you'll do in life I want you to put yourself in Hezekiah place he grew up seeing all this he saw his daddy making Molten imag to bail and saw them burn some of his siblings after the Heathen gods and he's seeing them pack up incense up into the Groves in the mountains and the whole nation's doing it and he felt like an oddball because it just wasn't in his heart to do it and then he saw his daddy ahaz delivered into the hands of the king of Syria and they smot him and carried away a great multitude of the people as captives here's Hezekiah he's seeing a nation that he's a King's son I'm a message believer this just isn't supposed to happen it was happening right in Judah it's happening right in it's right right in King David's lineage this kingdom is supposed to last forever it's kingdom is supposed to be raptured oh hang on I got some things to say to you and he says and They Carried a whole lot away his captives and brought them to Damascus which is in Syria and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel who smot him with a great Slaughter and the Lord brought Judah low because of ahaz king of Israel and he made Judah naked and transgressed sore against the Lord for he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus which smot him and he said because of the Gods of the king of Syria help them can now imagine how perverted a person gets here he's taken captive he's worshiping all these Heathen gods and he comes to a place where says well they actually helped us now I know maybe you don't understand where I'm coming from but do you know that it's possible for even Believers of this message to get to such a point that they think that things that come from the mentality of the world somehow is a benefit and this is going to you know this is going to be a benefit for us and it says ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in Jerusalem but they brought him not into the Seer of the Kings they wouldn't even bury him in the Seer of the Kings of Israel and Hezekiah his son reigned in instead now I got something to say to this congregation and as I said it be many of you young and your young families and so on and if this brother bis's last service I'd want to punch this home to you A lot of people say well you know I'm kind of what I am my dad does this or My Mother Does that or this is kind of you know this is a kind of thing that we do in our home and yet there's something down in your subconscious that says it's not quite right and there's something down in your subconscious says I should be much more fervent but all those around me they don't take it so serious so why should I take it serious I say what's what's that got to do with it here's Hezekiah and the whole nation around him and he's a King's son and all he can see is trouble everywhere they're going in idolatry they're becoming worldly they've got the modern thought of the world it's a whole this is what this is what the world does this is what the people do this is the way they think this is the way they conduct themselves this is the way they approach things but it's not God's way and there's something down deep on the inside in the subconscious that says and you young ladies and you young men and you couples and you of this congregation know real well God registers down in the subconscious that there's something further there's something more that there's something that is wrong there's something that you need to change and I'd say that it's not it's not going to stand it just won't carry water for us to say well I see someone else or my father's this or my brother's that or my family's this or my sisters that or this has happened who cares is that going to carry any weight we stand before God and say well I live the way I live because you know everything around me the kids weren't fervent around me other families weren't really fervent around me and I I I know that there was something more but anyway that's where I lived I don't know if I'm conveying it am I really getting it across this isn't intending to be harsh but it's intending to be truthful and I wouldn't want an influence in this church or to say I'm preaching because I know this message goes elsewhere and and something happened and ah has like you know something I'm going to it might squeeze your time brother Tom but I'm going to take a little time now I have to get to it then ah house became king and I haven't got time I have all kinds of scriptures on the screen but I'm not going to take the time ahaz uh not ahaz but Hezekiah now became king and I he was 20 25 when he became king and within the first right away in the first year and the first month the Bible first year in the first month he's 25 how many here are 25 let me say you raise your hand two or three right here he's 25 you know what he does he starts to clean up he starts to clean up the house of God that this place is a mess and the people are gone in such a way so he begins in the house of the Lord and he begins to clean up the place and take out the uncleanness out of the house of God and out of the country he had it in his heart and then besides that he begins then he calls the young men and the young Levites and they hadn't been Sanctified they were Levites but they weren't Sanctified I think we probably got some Levites here that aren't Sanctified yet and he he called them because they just been living the the way that the world lived and he called them and said sanctify yourself become Sanctified cuz there's a work to do you've got to serve God and you can't serve in the way that you are sanctify yourself get ready to do something for God dedicate yourself sanctify yourself things are going to change around here and a man begin to sanctify themselves and get ready to serve God these aren't these aren't men that are 40 and 50 and 60 years old these are young men and there one thing that's unique about this congregation and I don't know why God has done it but I have a a belief that he called it for a certain reason to put men into a certain place of usefulness because it's needed in this message at this hour we need men with substance we need women with character and integrity I don't care how others are this is the way I am I'm dedicated we live straight to the line God begin to bless him and his pages long it's chapters long you can read it in Chronicles you can read it in Kings Chronicles has a beautiful a beautiful account as the Chronicles goes through the life of Hezekiah and he begins to clean out the nation and he smashes the he smashes down the altars and he crushes all the molten all the images and he gets rid of them so the people don't even have it before their eyes anymore and he begins to clean out the whole nation and turns the nation in the Bible says he did that which was right in the sight of God and it was a marvelous time you know some of you young people may have parents that don't even bring you to church but you're here now I want you to level with your parents you say you either take me to church and get get me to the house of God or I'm going to find a way or I'm going to get somebody to come and pick me up to your shame parents that are believers of this message and can't even get their families to church I say it's a disgrace there's no other word to it within an hour at least hour or hour and a half it's no great burden what if you in China what if you're someplace you had to take a train you had to go on a boat and try and get get there to church you be so hungry to be in the house of God say you got to realize that you're it's essential that you're hear and hear the word of God preached this is the thing that changed you it's reaching into your subconscious reaching into your critical mind but even beyond that and it's changing you I say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's life character changing power in the word that we speak and they had a mighty Revival under Hezekiah it's really beautiful it's beautiful and it's bitter and it's sweet because it's sad also and he had he had all and God blessed him now I hope and I'm just going to take another 10 minutes or so Hezekiah and I hope you can catch this Hezekiah came into a situation that I would say would be very reminiscent of the era when brother Brenham came in on the scene ecumenical movement on the way Christian businessmen taking their getting way out of control out of place through we're going to send the gospel out people who aren't called to the ministry women preaching theological schools full of training and the whole thing was bound up into hundreds of denominations all bound up and he even confessed that he felt his ministry was to break those walls down and let the water come in of the Holy Spirit and let the water rise and let the ducks start fellowshipping together and so there is an in all of these uh Gatherings it's just a hodge podge and there's a little man declaring it straight and delivering the word and cleaning up the place and cleaning up the temple and calling people to repentance and calling people to a baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and demonstrating the power of God and the blessings of God start to come and the people come out from among them and the blessings of God start to come upon them and the groups are blessed and they're Gathering here and Gathering there are you following me and a whole time of blessing comes it's a a whole era of Revival and a whole transformation of things that's happening Hezekiah made a fatal error and just prior to that he got sick to death and God sent Isaiah the Prophet to his place came imagine him coming to the palace and now here's a palace and God has so blessed this Judah under Hezekiah they had treasures and vessels and the whole nation was dedicated to God and the blessing of God was falling upon it and seemed and and God would give him Victory when armies would come against him it seemed like nothing could take him he was just in and and the country and the Nations hurting the glory under Hezekiah here come Isaiah says to him set your house in order you're going to die and the Bible says he turned his face to the wall you know how fast he did it he did it instantly he turned his face to the wall and he began to weep profusely and he says oh god I've walked perfect before are you and I can't set things in order immediately I need 15 years and and Isaiah is just on his way and God says turn around and go back and tell Hezekiah I've heard his word and he goes back to Hezekiah and says the Lord has heard you and has added 15 years to your life and he says give me a sign and the sign was a sun dial whether it goes forward or it goes backward he said but it goes forward it's not such a great miracle but have it go backward and the sun dial went backward so many degrees as a sign I heard your prayer and you are healed brother brandom says he probably had cancer it says a boil in the Bible but he said a boil a person wouldn't normally die from a boil but it was some kind of a Cancer and God healed him and and and promptly promptly the king of Babylon from a far country heard about it you've heard of Babylon haven't you you know about Babylon don't you confusion of tongues babylon's in Genesis and babylon's in Revelation Babylon Babylon the greatest Fallen Babylon the mother of harlots Babylon set up by in Genesis I'm just trying to think of his name it's irrelevant right now right and he sends ambassadors he send some celebrities he sends some man of position and they come to hezakiah where from the king of Babylon and fact is I'm the son of baladan The King and I have come personally and I have letters from my father and we have gifts my father heard that you were sick and now we brought gifts and the Bible says so I don't know exactly what was in the letters but the Bible says and Hezekiah hearkened unto them so he listened to them and they must have had a request he begins to show him the glories of the house fatal mistake fatal error instead of saying oh take a message back to your father I was sick I was at the point of death but we have a prophet in the land and a prophet came to me and told me you're going to die and I begin to repent and I begin to weep and I told God I can't do it I can't do it I can't put my house in order I need 15 years and before the prophet even got to his home he was turned around and sent back to me and God gave me a message you shall live I've heard you I'm not sick I'm Healed but he was impressed he was impressed that a great king should send such Royal visitors he was impressed that they should send him a letter he was impressed that they should send him gifts and he was he was more impressed with that than he was with the very God who gave the vessels and he says come and I'll show you everything I'll show you and he begins to show a Godless King righteous vessels holy vessels Sanctified vessels and begins to expose them to this King and his people and Isaiah comes back to him with a message and Isaiah says who are these people that came oh he said they came from a far country even Babylon and what did they say and what did you do so I begin to show them everything and there was nothing that I didn't show them I showed them the treasures I showed them the stockpiles of the spices precious ointments I showed them absolutely everything and there's nothing in my house that I haven't shown them I showed them everything God gave us I showed them everything he was impressed and here was the here was the consequence of being impressed like that and Isaiah says hear the word of the Lord everything you showed them will go to Babylon and your sons that you haven't even begotten yet they're going to come out of your body they're going to take them there and make them Unix so they can't even have children and they'll be Unix in King baden's Kingdom and the very thing that you are impressed with you have become that time there was no repentance that would work nothing would work I know that you're thinking do you know that when a prophet of God you you hear these messages and listen I'm closing now in just a moment and you hear him scream out and you hear him preach his life out and you hear him pour His literal life stream out and he's pleading with the people and one of the big items in brother brandom's during that time was the influence of Hollywood and he could see that thing trying to invade and and and here was Pentecost with their gifts and the restoration and all of those things and here here's a prophet trying to make a line of Distinction we're not like those we're not part of those Nations we're not part of those denominations we're not all one we're not one he said and I say this they were impressed with the people and the celebrities that were coming in and they that were impressed by it have become it and Hollywood has taken over the whole thing what they call fundamental religion Hollywood has infiltrated it and the thing that they were impressed with has shaped them into the same thing until they use the same terminology and people get on the platform and it's featuring this singer and featuring that singer and featuring this Entertainer the whole thing is Hollywood from the bottom up because it's Babylon and you know that's true you can't even see it but it turns you ill inside we say how are we different thank God for a message I can't shout it out I can't I haven't got enough voice thank God for something that has cleansed us thank God for the washing of the water of the word thank God for a standard to live to there was no recovery from that and now we started out we started out in a house with a ly in Ohio we started in a there was a double garage and I I remember standing in that double garage and I thought how what a paradox and how wonderful this is here's people that are working factories here's a brother over here he's a bean farmer here's gladon here's brother Bill da chairman of a bank all sitting there in little chairs shoulder toosh shoulder multimillionaire over there Bean farmer over here man who works in a factory and and had actually it was his home that we're in we're there we'll walk in the light oh it's a beautiful light on the wings of Snow White du and in that beauty and in that Simplicity here's the people Gathering and little groups here and little groups there are you still with me and God moving sovereign ly remarkably moving and people yielding to it just giving themselves to it but I fear I have a great concern L as time goes on I don't know could you still want to meet in the house I was president of a company because we were trying to support the work and I knew this message had it and soon as soon as young people would come in give their life to Christ I said go right downstairs and plug yourself into the tapes you can get something there that I can't give you get right into the tapes and hear those and they would hear those as they weren't interested in a whole lot of things they took time and they just listened to the tapes and a lot of those people are sitting here in the congregation today I say glory be to God and it began to cultivate young men and cultivate families and cultivate children and cultivate preachers that are out preaching today because it's the same word and the planks were just 2 by1 or 2x 12 unplaned rough planks sitting on blocks of wood and I say to this congregation would you be satisfied with that we'd be satisfied to come in next Sunday say well that's where we start sometime we say well it's so cold well it's so hot well it's so this well so that but what it is is so spoiled and I think that you know preaching really you know the preacher is really going Beyond his time he's taking a lot of Liberty this is the truth this what we need this the kind of instruction we need and there's a danger that then when things get all you know so blessed and so blessed and then those with no experience no conviction no nothing just say oh we heard and this what I closed with last Sunday we heard we've heard we heard from so so and so somebody told us and so and so told us what's happening told us about your young people told us about your families told us about your school told us about something else oh that kind of impression I'm not impressed with and hezekiah's big mistake is he was not impressed with the vessels that God had given him but he was impressed with the recognition that he got because of his riches and today I want to end this service by saying I'm impressed I'm not impressed with this building I'm not impressed with our equipment I'm not impressed with all the music and and all all all the uh video things and I'm impressed with the people I'm impressed with dedicated men I'm impressed with a sanctification I'm impressed with Integrity I'm impressed with the vessels and I'm impressed that God has said you are my particular peculiar treasure amen you are the treasure you're the treasure not going to allow the devil to mop up his Temple floors I see listen I'm pretty well read and I'm in contact and I see how other I see how other organizations worship and I see the direction they're going and if you have contact with it make sure that you're the influence make sure that we're not impressed with something else out there I'm not impressed with finer things I'm not impressed with the things of the world I'm not impressed with Hollywood coming into the church I'm not impressed with the fashion of the world and if you see that this is what this this is what they do out there this is what they do this is what young people do get away from it move away from it can you say amen amen young people can you say amen God bless [Applause] you brother Bram spoke some great things about Hezekiah he was certainly a great King but I don't want to make hezekiah's error and the Bible says that we are to learn by those things say do you have any concerns about brother Ed do you have any concerns about Bible Way yeah I do L we become too prosperous too refined too fussy too stuffy too formal that we lose some of that reality some of that genuiness we get too too much pride too much you know I'm afraid somebody's going to see me who cares we need people to yield to God and that least little twins inside listen to that voice do what it says so whatever I go to the front repent what are people going to think who cares what they think do what the holy spirit says what will other churches think what will other people think we don't care what they think they're not our standard this church that church this message believer that preacher we're not we're not subject to that we're subject to what the Holy Spirit speaks in this place we need the support of everyone we need the support of everyone I say sanctify yourselves to our god sanctify yourselves I can't sanctify you you sanctify yourself before God hallelujah will you stand with me we just go to prayer father you've seen what's going on in my heart these last days and how I wondered I wondered I was so twisted up inside wondering because I couldn't see clearly what it was you were wanting to say and what you wanted to do how you want to affect the people and Lord there may be those here who have they've developed uh an exterior they've developed a front they've actually developed an acceptability they've been accepted and recognized as something but perhaps deep down in their heart today there is a witness inside by the holy spirit that is urging them others it might be cautioning them that something they're allowing does not take them in a Godly way and they need to turn from that they need to return they're hearing the voice return return come back into the path they may be hearing the voice of the messenger crying out stay in line stay in line stay in line Lord there may be others that you are moving upon and simply telling them you're too busy you're too taken up you're being swallowed by just the things of the world that mean nothing and and in in Eternal in Eternal value it will all pass away we all have our Our Lives to live and we have our jobs to do but oh God Faithful Holy Spirit the most important thing we have here to do is to establish the kingdom of God and spend our time and spend our energy and our resources that the kingdom of God may be established in the hearts I ask father that you'll bless the work your work thr the Earth and in the various countries where you've allowed us to have some part I pray that you'll bless these brothers bless those that are preparing to and Desiring to come to the convention prepare us oh Lord move upon this congregation send a mighty sweep of the Holy Spirit upon us oh God I certainly confess we've not reached the plateau that you would have us to be at we've not reached Reach the the best that best that you have I know that you have much more oh God we want to see I want to see the supernatural hand of almighty God saving those that are lost convicting the backslider oh God moving upon the hearts of the people and so that they will move on upward upward upward and they will influence others God let me be impressed by what you're doing and by the revelation of your word oh Father granted I pray and whatever it is that would please you now I pray that you will do what you would have done I wonder who would like to raise their hands say I'd just like to join with your brother Ed in prayer I'd like to pray together now father you see this congregation and you're the one that looks down in the hearts of the people you know what it is that they're Desiring because you put the desire there I'm praying that this day will be set aside and that throughout this afternoon oh Lord the people will just be getting more prepared more prepared for the evening service and oh God you'll drop down into our hearts oh speak Mighty things and do Mighty things oh God God some things that need to be done here this morning Lord do it don't let them get away don't let them move away from it don't let them quiet in the voice speak my Lord speak in the name of Jesus Christ I ask it let's sing speak my Lord speak my Lord speak and I'll be quick to answer thee and I want I just lay it with you you do what God is talking to you about you do that and if you know that you're not committed to Christ and you've not given your life to Christ I invite you here to come and kneel at this Altar and whether someone prays for you or not that's your immaterial it's what you pray and what you say to God that's what's important it's what how you dedicate yourself to God oh my Hallelujah and if you feel like worshiping worship then worship this God under hezekiah's rule they began to sacrifice and the Bible says that they that they worshiped until the sacrifices were all burnt oh God is worthy of all of our worship friends thank you Lord speak my Lord speak my Lord [Music] and Qui to [Music] answer speak my [Music] Lord speak my speak and I will answer [Music] once again speak my speak to me Lord Jesus speak my [Music] Lord I to answer speak my [Music] speak my speak and I will answer Lord Just As I Am Without One Plea just I am without [Music] one was sh for and th we [Music] come of God I the last verse just says I am th will receive just as th receive will freely and become because I promise [Music] I I want to sing that last verse once again and then we want to pray and right after that when we enter into prayer I know that God is speaking to perhaps many more than can even get around this Altar and you don't have to come around the altar that's not a requirement but it's a good thing to let the world know let your brothers and sisters know let the devil know you're responding you're answering to a call and I believe that God would have this congregation to sanctify themselves and if God is speaking to you concerning in that then I say take this opportunity say Lord I receive what I heard today and I take a move out of my regular course of my life I am sanctifying giving myself dedicating myself and yielding myself to you come Holy Spirit Come Oh Holy Spirit and do what is needful in my life and in my future days and in my decision making in Jesus name just as I am th will receive will well [Music] [Music] our precious Lord Jesus who has revealed the father to us the words that that hundreds in this congregation have just finished uttering is I come I come May those words hold true in describing their actions Lord I want it to be also my testimony here I am I come Without One Plea here I come here we are because you made the promise here I come oh God and I know you will receive here I come I know that you have fire to cleanse I know you have the spirit to baptize I know that you have all and more than is needful for every person let it be personal Lord let them enter into a personal experience and relationship with you something greater than they've ever had before and if the enemy is seeking to hold oh God some by habit some by habits of Life some by Pride religious Pride move it out in the name of Jesus Christ by all power of God and may Satan lose his hold I pray in Jesus Christ's name name bless your people Lord as they are dismissed in this
