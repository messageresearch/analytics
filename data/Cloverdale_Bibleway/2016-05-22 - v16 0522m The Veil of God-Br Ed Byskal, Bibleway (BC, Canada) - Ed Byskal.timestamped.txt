[14:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said they were called.
[14:24] They were selected.

[14:45] play my faith looks up to thee, thou
[14:48] lamb of Calvary.
[14:50] We just want to go to a prayer this
[14:53] morning. Remember an unspoken request
[14:55] for two loved ones facing a very very
[14:57] critical
[14:59] situation in their life. This is from
[15:01] the Rid Path family. We ask the Lord to
[15:03] intervene and bring complete and total
[15:06] healing. Amen. Also
[15:10] want to remember to
[15:14] uh this is from brother Victor Adamora.
[15:16] His brother has prostate condition and
[15:18] is being considered for surgery by
[15:20] Friday.
[15:21] Just asking that the Lord would direct
[15:23] the hands of the doctor for successful
[15:26] surgery. Why don't we just all bow our
[15:28] hearts and heads this morning? We'll
[15:30] just pray together and ask the deacons
[15:31] to come. Appreciate that, brothers.
[15:34] Let's just pray together. Father, we
[15:35] want to commit this entire day to you.
[15:39] Many have set aside time, Lord, to
[15:41] listen to the sound of the prophet's
[15:44] voice.
[15:46] The seventh angel that you sent in our
[15:48] day.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; For you, Lord, according to your own
[15:51] word said, I will send unto you Elijah
[15:54] the prophet. Lord, we received your word
[15:56] in our day. We want to give you thanks
[15:59] this morning, Lord, for giving us a
[16:01] seed, Lord, an incorruptible seed that
[16:04] could be birthed under the light of this
[16:06] message within each and every one of our
[16:08] lives. We're so truly thankful, oh God.
[16:11] This morning, we bring the needs and
[16:13] petitions of the congregation before
[16:15] you, Lord, asking that you would move on
[16:17] their behalf. This one with a prostate
[16:19] cancer, oh God, prostate condition.
[16:22] Lord, you know exactly what the need is
[16:25] there. Lord, if it would go to surgery,
[16:29] we pray that you would guide the hand of
[16:30] the physician that you have given a gift
[16:33] and a talent to. Lord, would you guide
[16:35] his hand? Lord, if you would see fit to
[16:38] even bring about a change in that
[16:40] prostate condition so that it wouldn't
[16:42] have to go that way, Lord, we would
[16:43] return and give you the praise. We
[16:46] return and give you the glory, Lord.
[16:48] We'd say one more time, you came upon
[16:50] the scene just in the last moments when
[16:53] all things seemed impossible. Lord,
[16:56] we're believers this morning.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; We believe in the impossible.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; We believe in those things we have not
[17:02] seen. What our eyes have not laid upon
[17:05] yet. We believe according to your word.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, drop faith in the hearts of the
[17:10] believer this morning.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, may we reach out, take a hold to
[17:14] the promise of God. We want to remember
[17:17] brother Tom Ray this morning,
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Lord. No doubt streaming in this
[17:22] morning. Just thinking about him earlier
[17:24] this morning. Lord, how he would desire
[17:27] &gt;&gt; to sit in the congregation of the people
[17:30] [Music]
[17:31] &gt;&gt; be his portion this morning. Oh God, may
[17:33] there be such a presence in that room.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Lord, may your love envelop him and
[17:38] bring healing. Oh God, you paid the
[17:41] price. Lord, we just ask Lord that it
[17:44] would be ministered
[17:46] &gt;&gt; into his body this morning.
[17:49] I want to remember brother John Andy's
[17:51] be traveling to Seattle this afternoon.
[17:54] Brother Kyle and Victoria,
[17:56] Lord, your many membered body needs to
[17:58] be ministered to this morning. We have
[18:01] needs in our own midst. Oh God,
[18:04] Lord, you've chosen a vessel, our
[18:06] pastor,
[18:07] brother Ed Biscll, Lord, to speak
[18:09] through this morning to our needs, Lord,
[18:12] to our hearts. We pray that you would
[18:13] open the eyes of our hearts. Lord,
[18:16] &gt;&gt; let us see you moving amongst your
[18:18] people.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; We'll be sure to give you the praise and
[18:22] the honor and the glory. As the deacons
[18:25] take up the offering, bless them, Lord.
[18:27] Bless the offering that's given. Each
[18:29] and everyone that can give and
[18:30] contribute. We ask that you would bless
[18:32] them abundantly. We give you thanks in
[18:35] all things this morning in Jesus
[18:37] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

[32:26] [Music]
[32:34] Heavenly Father, this is not only our
[32:37] prayer.
[32:39] This is our desire. This is our hunger.
[32:41] This is what we're thirsting after. So
[32:44] we ask that you will open our eyes, open
[32:47] our ears, and open our mouth that we
[32:50] might praise you in spirit and in truth.
[32:53] Father, I pray that our hearts will be
[32:56] blended with the Holy Spirit and it'll
[33:00] become one. Oh cad, reveal yourself to
[33:04] us. Speak to us, we pray. And now, Lord
[33:08] Jesus, we want you to be glorified
[33:11] in our service today. We're gathered
[33:14] here, Lord, at a time of prayer. We're
[33:17] asking, Father, that you will bless in
[33:20] the service in Victoria. Our brother
[33:23] Kyle Morton and Sister Christina there
[33:26] there and all the saints that are
[33:28] gathered. Bless them. those that will be
[33:30] gathered in Reton and our brother John
[33:32] Andy's down there going down. We pray
[33:35] that you'll bless them, oh Father, all
[33:37] that gather, Father, the bride of Jesus
[33:41] Christ. We do not know them all, but you
[33:43] know everyone.
[33:45] You said they are yours and you must
[33:48] gather them. We pray that you will
[33:51] bless, oh God, the gathering of the
[33:53] bride of Christ around the world in
[33:55] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[34:00] Let's just have you have your seats for
[34:02] just a moment. I have a couple of uh
[34:04] announcements we'd like to make before
[34:06] we
[34:08] go any further. Nice to see you all
[34:10] here. And I want to thank those of you
[34:13] that had opportunity to uh give yourself
[34:17] to the message uh unveiling of God. That
[34:20] will help us this morning. But I want to
[34:24] mention the family camp that's uh going
[34:26] to be taking place in July. Uh it'll
[34:31] family camp 2016 will be July the 25th
[34:35] to the 31st. And the junior camp will
[34:39] start on Monday the 25th.
[34:42] Uh and then and then the camp speaker is
[34:46] going to be brother Danny Stemon. He's a
[34:50] pastor there in what?
[34:53] and Sarasota, Florida. Exactly. Right.
[34:57] And brother Danny has been here before.
[35:00] Uh so we certainly have enjoyed his
[35:03] ministry,
[35:05] also his father's ministry. I really
[35:07] loved his father and uh he was he was
[35:11] just such an original.
[35:15] You know, we're all originals, but every
[35:17] once in a while you run into one, and it
[35:20] seems that God just took the pattern and
[35:21] threw it someplace into into the
[35:25] universe. And his father was the just
[35:27] like that, brother Johnny Steman. And
[35:29] now, Brother Danny Steman, so glad and
[35:32] nice to see his son stepping up, taking
[35:35] the church and and giving it leadership.
[35:39] this e this afternoon. Uh I say
[35:42] afternoon, it'll be afternoon by the
[35:44] time we get to it. But after this
[35:46] morning's service will be the baptism.
[35:48] We're having a baptism at Sister Kora.
[35:52] Uh Sister Cora, would you like to stand
[35:56] there? God bless you, Sister Cora.
[36:01] Thank you. Thank you. You may be seated.
[36:05] And brother Ryan. Where's Brother Ryan?
[36:10] above. All right.
[36:13] [Applause]
[36:16] So, we have two baptisms uh after the
[36:20] service, after the preaching of the
[36:22] word, and brother
[36:24] Murphy will be doing the baptizing.
[36:27] Brother John and he have met together
[36:31] and uh have had further counseling and
[36:35] so on. And sister Kora is related to
[36:39] Sister Juniper.
[36:41] Uh I believe Anise by marriage are all
[36:44] right. God bless you.
[36:48] So also I want to mention this is the
[36:51] latest faith challenge report.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; You haven't received it yet, you can get
[36:57] your copy. Is that it?
[36:59] &gt;&gt; They're in the foyer now. Uh once you
[37:03] get it, you will you'll just want to
[37:05] read all of it and get it and take one
[37:10] if you have someone that you're going to
[37:12] send it to. uh brother brother Tim and
[37:16] uh has done an a wonderful job in inside
[37:22] is it's uh the details of Ethiopia
[37:26] and uh the Chinese Bible
[37:31] uh I had to smile in fact is I had to
[37:34] actually more than smile I I told
[37:38] brother Murphy that I had to actually
[37:40] laugh out loud
[37:42] at at some of the comments about the
[37:44] Bible because I had asked him to get to
[37:48] get the comments from Chinese believers
[37:51] and uh one brother Lou he said uh when I
[37:55] compared the Chinese King James version
[37:58] in Union that's the Union Bible the one
[38:01] they had
[38:03] uh he said I found there's a strange
[38:05] spirit in the Union Bible because of
[38:09] many important verses I thought that is
[38:13] really wonderful. He said, "Especially
[38:15] when I read many of the verses
[38:17] translated exactly as the prophet has
[38:21] said in the message, my heart became so
[38:24] excited like in the book of Ezekiel 8
[38:27] and2." The Union Bible said as the color
[38:30] of gold, but the King James uh Chinese
[38:33] King James version translated literally
[38:35] the color of amber. And that's exactly
[38:38] what the prophet described. Oh, praise
[38:40] the Lord. Uh this brother Lou I'm sorry
[38:43] he said when I compared King James
[38:45] version to Union I found there's a
[38:48] strange spirit in the Union Bible
[38:50] because many many uh many important
[38:55] verses are not translated exactly as the
[38:58] original said such as in the New
[39:01] Testament Romans 16 and1 and 1 Timothy 3
[39:04] and 11 the Union Bible translated woman
[39:08] deacon
[39:09] but this is absolutely contrary to
[39:11] Paul's with Paul's teaching. When I
[39:14] looked in the King James, Chinese King
[39:16] James version, sure enough, it said a
[39:19] servant of of the church as Romans and
[39:23] their wives, First Timothy. No wonder
[39:26] many churches today are many churches
[39:29] today use these verses to ordain women
[39:33] pastors and women deacons. All these
[39:37] wrongly translated verses leads me to
[39:40] think it is there is a strange spirit
[39:44] purposely trying to hide something from
[39:47] the true believers.
[39:49] So you can imagine how how the practice
[39:52] how the practice of the church ends up
[39:55] completely
[39:56] contrary to the word of God uh because
[40:00] they just extend something and uh it was
[40:03] like uh like a Jehovah's Witness lady
[40:05] and nothing wrong with Jehovah's
[40:07] Witness. I just happened they happened
[40:09] to come to my door. So, it's them coming
[40:11] to me, not me coming to them and uh were
[40:15] wanting to inform me about something.
[40:17] And I said, "Well, that's fine. I just
[40:19] don't have time. I'm in the middle of
[40:21] studying. I'm actually studying. You
[40:23] interrupted my studies because I'm
[40:25] getting ready to preach." Oh, she said,
[40:28] "I'm a preacher, too." I said, "Well,
[40:30] that's against the word of God." Well,
[40:32] well, she said Deborah was a prophetist,
[40:35] but I said, but Jesus chose chose
[40:37] disciples and none of them were women
[40:40] and they weren't to carry the seed.
[40:43] That's all. It's just that simple.
[40:45] Anyway, they decided that they were
[40:47] needed to be on their way right away. So
[40:54] my wife didn't have time either once
[40:56] when a couple had come and
[40:59] and uh so she said she she just thought
[41:02] she'll just start right at the right at
[41:04] the very basic and she says, "Well, did
[41:06] you know that uh Cain was the son of the
[41:09] serpent?" And they said, "Oh, there's no
[41:10] hope for you. They just walked away."
[41:13] So if you ever need an answer, there you
[41:15] have one.
[41:19] Isn't he wonderful?
[41:21] &gt;&gt; All right, I'll have you stand and we're
[41:23] going to turn to John the 14th chapter.
[41:28] It's always good when you read the
[41:30] scripture. Uh John 14 is the chapter
[41:36] uh that the text was taken from
[41:40] for things that are to be. That's the
[41:44] third last service preached.
[41:48] And this uh at least my Scoffield Bible
[41:52] says that
[41:54] John 14:1,
[41:56] let your let not your heart be troubled
[42:00] was spoken in the Passover chamber and
[42:03] Jesus foretells his his coming for his
[42:07] own in John 14. He's just getting ready
[42:10] to leave. So it's spoken in the Passover
[42:13] chamber and it's the and and brother
[42:16] Brandham at the very end of his this is
[42:18] at the very end of Jesus Christ the son
[42:21] of man that's very end of his ministry
[42:24] and he's going to John 14. I somehow
[42:28] believe in my own heart. It's not
[42:30] doctrine, but I believe in my own heart
[42:32] that Jesus knew when he would come back
[42:36] to reveal himself in a redeemed son that
[42:40] he'd be choosing the same chapter just
[42:43] before he left.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Something to think about, isn't it?
[42:50] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to start to read at verse
[42:52] eight, please.
[42:56] Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the
[43:00] father, and it sufficeth us or satisfies
[43:04] us. Jesus sth unto him, Have I been so
[43:08] long time with you, and hast thou not
[43:10] known me, Phillip? He that hath seen me
[43:14] hath seen the Father? And how sayest
[43:17] thou then, show us the Father?
[43:21] Believest thou not that I am in the
[43:24] Father, and the Father in me? The words
[43:28] that I speak unto you, I speak not of
[43:31] myself, but the Father that dwelleth in
[43:35] me, he doeth the works. Amen.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus almost here makes a uh
[43:45] he himself
[43:47] and the father and the words that he
[43:51] speaks which are the father's words
[43:54] almost synonymous with each other. It's
[43:57] me, the father that's in me and the
[44:00] words I speak. They're all three
[44:04] synonymous.
[44:05] And then when we come down to John 14,
[44:08] the 19th verse, just look at the 19th
[44:12] verse.
[44:13] Yet a little while and the world seeth
[44:16] me no more, but you see me.
[44:19] Because I live, you shall live also.
[44:23] At that day you shall know that I am in
[44:26] the father and you in me and I in you.
[44:31] So now it is almost appears
[44:35] uh uh just depended on how you can
[44:38] perceive it that you as an individual
[44:41] have become synonymous.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Uh I don't mean equal to but synonymous
[44:47] with Christ
[44:50] the father
[44:52] the word that's in the father. So this
[44:54] you Christ the father and the words of
[45:00] God are to be merged into a single unit.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[45:08] &gt;&gt; We pray the Lord will bless us as you
[45:10] have your seats.
[45:19] So when I read uh John 8 uh 14:8-10,
[45:24] I just want to lay a little quick
[45:25] foundation here. Uh
[45:30] Jesus words had advanced beyond
[45:33] parables. Now
[45:35] &gt;&gt; when he said,
[45:37] "Have I been so long time with you,
[45:40] &gt;&gt; John?" or rather Philillip. And hast
[45:43] thou not known me?
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Uh, he that hath known me, you've not
[45:49] known the father. But if thou hast not
[45:52] known me, Philillip, he that hath seen
[45:54] me hath seen the father. And how sayest
[45:57] thou show us the father? Now, here's
[45:59] here's not a Philillip is not some
[46:03] lightweight.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Uh Philip's a firm disciple of the Lord
[46:08] Jesus. Show us the father. And and there
[46:11] was something there was something in the
[46:13] last later words of Jesus that it it had
[46:17] advanced. So I want to say that the
[46:19] message of Jesus had advanced very much
[46:22] from parables
[46:24] &gt;&gt; to something that was very
[46:27] uh very heavy
[46:29] &gt;&gt; and very much meat I would say for the
[46:33] believers. He wasn't saying it to
[46:34] everyone but he was saying it to
[46:36] Philillip. Philip wanted to know
[46:38] something specific
[46:40] &gt;&gt; and so now it was not a parable any
[46:43] longer. I want to say that the message
[46:45] has advanced
[46:46] &gt;&gt; and when you were reading and you that
[46:49] were reading and have listened to and
[46:51] have uh some have listened to it several
[46:54] times I trust you had opportunity the
[46:58] unveiling of God. I have been in it. In
[47:00] fact is there's the last few pages I
[47:02] still need to read because I have been
[47:05] so slow. I've been reading it for maybe
[47:07] two weeks uh and many more times before
[47:10] that because there are areas in uh in
[47:15] that message. It's not it's not one of
[47:18] the lighter brother Brandon would say
[47:20] for example now we're just going to go
[47:22] down at this church and in honor of
[47:24] another man's pulpit we're going to have
[47:26] like an evangelistic service and we'll
[47:28] have a prayer line. The prayer line's
[47:31] not a lightweight thing, but and the
[47:34] unveiling and the revealing of the
[47:36] heart. None of those things are but the
[47:39] message really advanced al from a first
[47:42] pole ministry to a second pole to a
[47:45] third pole which he said was the opening
[47:48] of the word. And so the opening of the
[47:50] word requires something more of us.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; It requires a intensity. It it requires
[47:58] a hunger. It requires a sincerity. I
[48:02] believe it requires a uh just us to be
[48:06] sanctified to the word and to give
[48:08] ourselves to it. say that's why we're
[48:11] singing open our my eyes that I may see
[48:19] in the message uh show us the father
[48:24] in early message brother Brandham spoke
[48:25] it several times but he in early message
[48:29] he said every man
[48:32] since the dawn of time has longed to see
[48:35] God
[48:38] &gt;&gt; uh want to look at him. Job one time
[48:41] said, "Oh, if I only knew where he was."
[48:45] In other words, if I knew where to go
[48:48] and knock on his door and he'd open up
[48:51] the door and I'd come in and sat down
[48:54] and talk with him. He said, "That's the
[48:56] way people want to see God." And yet God
[48:59] was so close to Job till he was speaking
[49:03] to him. And in in Job 23, it actually
[49:07] says, "Oh," and this is the scripture
[49:09] Brother Brand's referring to, "Oh, that
[49:11] I knew where I might find him." Job
[49:14] said, uh, "And I might come even to his
[49:18] seat. I would order my cause before him,
[49:21] and I would fill my mouth with
[49:23] arguments. I would know, not to argue
[49:26] with God, but I would fill them with
[49:28] words. I would know the words which he
[49:31] would answer me and understand what he
[49:34] would say unto me.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; That was his hunger.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Just imagine what Job had been through.
[49:40] And then but this is what he's this is
[49:43] essentially what he's craving in another
[49:45] place and show show us the father. He
[49:48] said show us the father and it will
[49:49] suffice. Now that has been the human
[49:53] heart's desire since the world began. if
[49:56] they could only see God. And and he
[50:00] refers to Job once again. And and these
[50:03] are two different two different
[50:04] messages.
[50:07] God made man, all of us, man, woman,
[50:12] young people,
[50:14] children, even children. God made us to
[50:17] thirst. God actually constructed us to
[50:20] thirst after him. Amen.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Now, that's an important statement
[50:24] because I'm going to be taking a turn, a
[50:28] very important turn here in a few
[50:29] moments. Satan, this the Bible says that
[50:33] this present evil world, the prophet
[50:37] says this is Satan's Eden.
[50:40] And Satan has taken, this is where I'll
[50:43] be going in a few moments. Satan has
[50:46] taken all the things of God's original
[50:50] creation.
[50:52] I was reading about uh predestination
[50:55] because perhaps I might touch on that.
[50:57] But do you know that even the metals
[51:00] in the earth listen now the metals in
[51:04] the earth just the whether it be iron or
[51:08] gold or silver whatever more they're all
[51:10] predestinated.
[51:12] You can't take You can't take silver ore
[51:15] and make it something else.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; It's silver.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is. And gold is
[51:21] gold
[51:22] &gt;&gt; and iron is iron and 10 is tin and
[51:25] copper is copper. It's predestinated to
[51:27] be that way. And that happens to be what
[51:30] you are. You're predestinated.
[51:36] There might be one ore that has more to
[51:40] overload or overburden to grind off, but
[51:43] it'll come out the same.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Could preach on that, but I'm just I'm
[51:51] just laying that as a foundation.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; So, God was so close to Job, but he
[51:56] didn't know it. God was close to another
[51:59] couple men uh centuries later, which
[52:01] were two men on the way to Emmas.
[52:05] But they didn't know that someone was
[52:07] with them. Uh that understood are you a
[52:10] stranger here in Jerusalem and you don't
[52:12] know all the things that have happened
[52:14] and here they're talking to the very one
[52:17] that had happened to but he he had
[52:20] changed form and so he was veiled from
[52:23] them. Yes.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; So, we're talking about I want to speak
[52:28] to you on this subject, the veil of God.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; And uh the unveiling of God is the
[52:37] uncovering. Brother Brandham did not
[52:39] speak on the veil of God. He spoke on
[52:42] the unveiling of God.
[52:50] The scripture two men on the way to
[52:52] Emmas no doubt had heard Jesus say a
[52:56] little while and you shall see me again
[52:59] and again. A little while and you shall
[53:02] uh and you shall see me. He said first
[53:05] I'm sorry. A little while and you shall
[53:07] not see me. And again, a little while
[53:09] and you shall see me because I go to the
[53:13] father.
[53:16] I'm just having a little difficulty
[53:17] because we've got some shadows down here
[53:19] on the pulpit.
[53:22] Yet he came so near, but they were
[53:25] unaware of him because he was veiled in
[53:29] another form.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[53:31] &gt;&gt; He was the same person. And it was Jesus
[53:32] Christ. But he was veiled in another
[53:35] form. He had passed from mortal to
[53:37] immortality.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; For you that are awaiting the change and
[53:44] I trust you all are.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Brother John Andy's was praying in the
[53:48] study and he not I noticed that he's
[53:51] praying that we are the people of the
[53:54] change and we're looking for the change
[53:57] and we are indeed looking for the
[53:59] change. But now I want you to bear in
[54:03] mind that we're also looking to a God.
[54:07] We're we're we're we're in a message
[54:10] called the unveiling of God. Why is it
[54:14] unveiling? Because there's there's
[54:17] something of a change taking place. And
[54:20] I want you to think about that.
[54:24] And joy did not come to these two that
[54:27] were walking with Jesus until they
[54:29] recognized
[54:31] who he was.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; And I really think that we've advanced
[54:35] in the message from parables and maybe
[54:39] uh evangelistic type of services and
[54:42] fundamentals of the gospel. Uh we still
[54:46] need those. You always need the
[54:48] fundamentals, but we well I I trust that
[54:51] you'll move a little beyond that to
[54:54] this. We're we're we're talking about
[54:57] children of the rapture, people of the
[54:59] change. And and it's essential that you
[55:03] all recognize that in this message is
[55:07] actually pregnantated, this message is
[55:10] pregnantated with the power to change.
[55:14] Now, some of you young people are going
[55:16] to be graduating and and some of you
[55:18] have graduated and some of you will be
[55:20] graduating this year and perhaps going
[55:22] on to further education. Why do you go
[55:24] on to further education? Well, I don't
[55:27] know anything about accounting, but I
[55:29] hope after 3 four years that I'll I'll
[55:31] know something about it. Oh, you
[55:33] actually are expecting the words of some
[55:35] book to change you from someone who
[55:38] knows nothing about it to somebody who's
[55:40] a a tax expert or an accounting expert
[55:43] or you can audit books and all that.
[55:45] It's just the words
[55:47] &gt;&gt; in certain books that will transform you
[55:50] from what you are to a mechanic or to a
[55:53] farmer or to know something about
[55:55] something you don't know anything about
[55:57] today.
[55:58] You see some young fellow, you know,
[56:01] some of you young fellas here and think
[56:03] uh that I might commit myself to you for
[56:06] brain surgery. Well, not quite yet.
[56:09] You're going to have to be transformed
[56:11] by something. Something's going to have
[56:13] to happen or you might not know what to
[56:15] do with the scalpel.
[56:18] And I don't want to commit myself to
[56:19] you. I can tell you, brother Tom Ray
[56:22] right now, he's he's listening to me. He
[56:25] he committed himself to the finest that
[56:28] is in in Canada as far as we know. And
[56:31] he was a student of Dr. uh Hansen in uh
[56:37] in Seattle. And Dr. Hansen, I think, is
[56:39] probably one of the finest in the world.
[56:41] And there's a wing of the hospital down
[56:44] there in Seattle that's called after Dr.
[56:47] Hansen. And Dr. Hansen always seemed to
[56:50] just be something very, very special.
[56:52] Joanne spent I think weeks probably
[56:55] looking for a doctor anywhere in the
[56:57] world because they did not have and this
[57:00] would be a news to some of you but I
[57:02] won't take any time with it except to
[57:04] say uh we we we had artificial hip
[57:08] joints artificial knee joints but did
[57:11] not have artificial ankle joints. The
[57:13] ankle is a very very complicated
[57:16] multiple multiplicity of of bones and so
[57:20] on all together and balancing each way
[57:23] etc. And I understand that a man in
[57:26] either South Dakota or North Dakota
[57:28] actually invented it and it was it's
[57:31] been a kind of recent the uh the reason
[57:34] why to brother Tom Ray had his done in
[57:37] Seattle is because it had never been
[57:39] done in Canada period and the government
[57:42] of British Columbia paid for the entire
[57:45] operation down in Seattle. and uh
[57:49] Johnson and Johnson, the medical people
[57:52] bought that uh I think bought the um
[57:55] invention out and now it has been
[57:58] refined a wee bit. And so, Brother Tom
[58:01] had two operations on it for that
[58:04] artificial uh artificial ankle ankle
[58:08] joint. And so, he is uh rather rare.
[58:11] It's hard hard to come around, you know,
[58:15] it was very expensive becoming rare.
[58:18] But anyway,
[58:20] uh this time he didn't have it. Just one
[58:23] of the one of the connections that
[58:26] became a little bit loose, not in the
[58:28] actual joint itself, but into the bone.
[58:30] And it was very very painful. And so
[58:33] that's all fixed. And incidentally, he
[58:35] want to thank you for your prayers very
[58:38] very much because uh the he is he is
[58:42] almost 100% free of of pain.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; That's really wonderful.
[58:59] So, we talk about the two men on the way
[59:00] to Emmas, but we we've been called to
[59:02] live in another season. We're not back
[59:04] there.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; We're up here in another season.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Uh, and this is a very, very,
[59:12] very unusual.
[59:14] I had probably one of the most difficult
[59:16] times I've had in years with this
[59:19] particular message that I'm speaking to
[59:21] you. And you might say, well, it is so
[59:23] simple. Uh, well, it's simple yet. Uh,
[59:28] but I had a great difficulty. I wanted
[59:32] to distill the age that we're in without
[59:35] depressing you. And that was a very very
[59:39] challenging. I see you smiling, brother
[59:42] Ken. Thank you. uh because it's it's
[59:46] it's almost impossible to describe this
[59:49] age. But I want you to think about now
[59:52] just think about this. God created all
[59:56] things and when he had finished his
[59:58] creation, he looked upon it and he said,
[1:00:00] "It's good. It's very good."
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; God would not look or could not look
[1:00:07] upon what Satan has done with his
[1:00:10] creation and say it's very good. That's
[1:00:12] right.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; And fact is it's going to be fit for a
[1:00:15] lake of fire.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said some things that
[1:00:21] were just very very very interesting. I
[1:00:24] decided I would look at what he said
[1:00:27] about atomic power. And each time I went
[1:00:30] to it, he talked about uh the flood
[1:00:35] and that they had atomic power back
[1:00:37] then. and and and and
[1:00:41] turned the earth perhaps away from the
[1:00:44] sun. He just put it in simple language,
[1:00:46] turned away from the sun. He said, "Now
[1:00:49] this time it'll be thrown into the sun."
[1:00:52] And I had just finished I had just
[1:00:55] finished listening to the news and India
[1:01:00] having 51° C
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; which is about 100 almost 125°
[1:01:08] Fahrenheit.
[1:01:09] and uh and they had the whole map of the
[1:01:12] nation just red as red as could be from
[1:01:17] the terrible terrible heat and hundreds
[1:01:20] and hundreds of people have perished
[1:01:23] uh because of the heat and and they said
[1:01:25] that this morning they said that it was
[1:01:28] not this morning I guess it was last
[1:01:30] night they said that the people were
[1:01:32] just a little bit relieved it had had
[1:01:34] just dropped below 50° C. I was in India
[1:01:39] when it it got to 41 and I didn't think
[1:01:42] I was going to survive. I just laid
[1:01:44] listless on a bed. Uh I think brother
[1:01:48] Tim perhaps brother John you've been in
[1:01:50] countries when it's 40° and that's hot.
[1:01:54] That's very very hot. I've just my head
[1:01:57] was just swimming and I just laid still.
[1:01:59] I couldn't do anything. I don't know
[1:02:01] what I would do in 51 degrees
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; and another shortage of water
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; and are trying to bring water in and
[1:02:11] tank. Hey, hey, this is a billion
[1:02:14] people,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; a billion people in that country. I just
[1:02:18] wonder if we call global warming,
[1:02:21] warming is actually
[1:02:24] uh something that man is doing that's
[1:02:27] throwing it throwing it towards the sun
[1:02:31] and it's just terrible heat. I got
[1:02:33] thinking about I just I just was
[1:02:35] thinking about what would we do? Yeah.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Uh we had a summer here just a one or
[1:02:41] one or two ago and everything just caked
[1:02:44] and turned brown last year. Almost the
[1:02:47] large cedar trees in our yard just
[1:02:50] limped and laid there. Branches hung
[1:02:54] down and there was no water, not enough
[1:02:56] water. We weren't allowed to put water
[1:02:58] on them. Uh not allowed to put water on
[1:03:01] the lawns or the flowers or anything.
[1:03:04] And oh that's all fine because you know
[1:03:07] oh it couldn't happen here.
[1:03:10] What if it did?
[1:03:13] What if it did? Uh there's so much
[1:03:16] water. Canada has so much water. I think
[1:03:19] 109 barrels for every person
[1:03:24] uh a year and and and we got so much
[1:03:27] fresh water in the Pacific Northwest and
[1:03:29] lakes and on and on. And uh I can tell
[1:03:33] you one thing. Whatever God has said in
[1:03:36] his word,
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; And whatever God has spoken through that
[1:03:39] prophet, you better hear it.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it's going to be.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; He might have said it in some very plain
[1:03:46] language. You're going to throw it
[1:03:48] toward the sun or throw it in that
[1:03:50] direction or whatever more. Uh it only
[1:03:53] means one thing. It's going to be hot.
[1:03:55] Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; So, we're called to live in another age.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Satan's Eden is a perversion of God's
[1:04:05] Eden.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. The
[1:04:09] things, everything that you see, we have
[1:04:12] the lights and we have all this
[1:04:14] material. All of this was somewhere
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; in this earth
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; at one time. man and his wisdom and man
[1:04:24] and his knowledge and being inspired by
[1:04:27] Satan and and uh and the prophet said
[1:04:31] one thing, science, what has science got
[1:04:33] for you? More death.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; That's just a short statement. And we
[1:04:38] cringe from that and we say, "Oh, surely
[1:04:40] this is so nice." What's nice?
[1:04:44] Well,
[1:04:45] you know, all the color and the fabric
[1:04:48] and everything is so nice and it changes
[1:04:50] every year and keeps us running on the
[1:04:53] treadmill and pushing out the credit
[1:04:56] cards and it's all wonderful.
[1:04:59] You're real quiet.
[1:05:05] God saw that everything that he made and
[1:05:08] behold it was very good.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Genesis 3. Satan cannot create.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; These are just brief statements, but
[1:05:17] they're true statements. He cannot
[1:05:19] create. He can only pervert what has
[1:05:22] been created.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Everything that we see, we've got our
[1:05:26] cars out there. We have all of our fine
[1:05:30] things and we have our homes and all the
[1:05:32] appliances and everything. Everything
[1:05:34] came out of this earth that God made in
[1:05:37] the first place. all the metals and all
[1:05:40] the fabrics and all the plastics and all
[1:05:43] the things that we have. Well, you say,
[1:05:45] "Well, man has made it." Uh, all it has
[1:05:48] all come as a perversion. And Satan
[1:05:51] cannot create, he can only pervert what
[1:05:54] God has created. He's taken substances
[1:05:58] created by God and put it on the earth
[1:06:02] to captivate the five senses.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Good. And now if he captivates the five
[1:06:09] senses
[1:06:11] and we end up we end up so much in this
[1:06:15] age. We look at whether it be magazines
[1:06:19] or the newspapers or something. Just try
[1:06:21] to turn your eyes away from it. You go
[1:06:23] into a restaurant and there's all the
[1:06:25] sports guys and they're doing their
[1:06:27] thing and you just try to look at the
[1:06:29] menu, you know, and you want to look up
[1:06:32] there cuz it's flashes something else.
[1:06:36] what what what is it now? Or you know,
[1:06:38] and and whether it be the news, it could
[1:06:41] be something very very innocent, but uh
[1:06:43] he's he's and if he gets you
[1:06:48] or me just looking at it, well uh I I
[1:06:53] have to try to control this thing
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; cuz it buzzes. Oh,
[1:06:59] it vibrates. I don't have any sound on
[1:07:02] it. But I'll be sitting with somebody
[1:07:03] goes ting ting ting tingling ting ting
[1:07:05] tingling ting ting. I just feel like
[1:07:07] shut that thing off. And
[1:07:10] I saw an ad once and it was some ladies
[1:07:13] trying to have a a little tea, you know,
[1:07:17] and they were out on a nice uh like a
[1:07:20] little patio with a beautiful lake out
[1:07:23] there and everybody and suddenly they
[1:07:26] all stopped. Zip zip zip zip zip. And
[1:07:30] they all just grabbed their phone and
[1:07:31] all with no union threw it into the
[1:07:33] water and then they were at peace.
[1:07:36] They were finally at peace and could
[1:07:38] enjoy enjoy everything and their phones
[1:07:41] were in the water. Well, I don't have to
[1:07:43] worry about mine. I have it off here.
[1:07:45] But once in a while, you know, it it's
[1:07:48] there's a convenient side to it and say,
[1:07:50] you know, somebody wants to get you and
[1:07:53] there's an urgency and you know, they
[1:07:55] want you to pray or they want you to go
[1:07:57] to the hospital or something and but but
[1:08:00] but there's a lot of garbage on it.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of damn damning things on
[1:08:07] it.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And say, "Oh, well, the net, the net,
[1:08:10] that's exactly what it is. It's a net."
[1:08:14] And I just want to ask you if if Satan
[1:08:17] now has why has he done all this? Not to
[1:08:20] make life just so much easier for us and
[1:08:24] to make us a more wholesome people. Why
[1:08:27] we've gone we've gotten so rank it isn't
[1:08:29] even
[1:08:32] look what you have for leaders. Look
[1:08:33] what we have for leaders.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Godless people. Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; In fact, as one of our members of
[1:08:42] parliament just stood up this last week
[1:08:45] and he said in uh and he said in this is
[1:08:49] this is our government. This is the
[1:08:51] government who are supposed to be making
[1:08:53] laws for us to live by. And they stand
[1:08:56] he said I could not use the words I
[1:09:00] could not use the words in public that
[1:09:02] our leader has used. Yeah,
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; this is absolutely incredible. So, are
[1:09:09] we talking about well just a gathering
[1:09:11] of bad things? No. This is where the
[1:09:13] world has gotten to. And and and
[1:09:17] do we fly on planes? Absolutely. I don't
[1:09:19] want to be on one that goes into the
[1:09:21] ocean.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Uh do we drive cars? Absolutely. And and
[1:09:26] we're we're I'm happy that we'll be able
[1:09:28] to step into one out here, but don't
[1:09:30] ever get your eyes on that.
[1:09:35] Do you hear me?
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Because if I want to ask you a question
[1:09:41] now. If we become captivated,
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; which we are
[1:09:48] largely,
[1:09:50] if we become captivated
[1:09:53] and we're just uh
[1:09:55] well, we're actually under the control
[1:09:58] of oh well this oh this isn't new and
[1:10:02] style has changed etc etc and I need to
[1:10:05] get another one and so on when and we do
[1:10:08] I don't want you to get you know I I
[1:10:11] don't want to get you're bound. But
[1:10:13] nevertheless, on the other hand, I want
[1:10:15] to ask you a serious question. If we
[1:10:17] become captivated by that, now who has
[1:10:20] become unveiled before us? Right.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm afraid that Satan has succeeded
[1:10:30] in veiling himself
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; in beautiful things
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; in just such lovely things
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; and beautiful people and celebrities and
[1:10:44] talented people and in the sports world
[1:10:47] and until until he has become God. Yes.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; And then in the church, everything is so
[1:10:56] nice, but we don't want it too hot. We
[1:10:59] don't want it too cold. We want the
[1:11:01] lights. So, we want the sound. We want
[1:11:04] And if it's not just right, you know, I
[1:11:07] want it to feel right. I want it to
[1:11:10] sound right so I can hear it. I want it
[1:11:13] so I can see. I want it to look right.
[1:11:16] And what's it appealing to? The five
[1:11:18] senses. And the prophet of God, this
[1:11:21] prophet says, "Your five senses were not
[1:11:24] given to you to contact God.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; They they are given to you to contact
[1:11:30] this world.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; But God then now I'm going to move to
[1:11:34] another phrase and please listen very
[1:11:37] very carefully because we start suddenly
[1:11:40] getting into deep water and I'm speaking
[1:11:42] just from inspiration now." And that is
[1:11:45] why that is why God had become flesh.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; And that's what the unveiling of God is
[1:11:55] all about. He had to become flesh.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; He had to come down in this cursed earth
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; and take all soil a body of the earth
[1:12:05] which was cursed
[1:12:07] and lived in that with the word. And so
[1:12:10] the prophet says, so you'll find in the
[1:12:12] unveiling of God that the prophet and
[1:12:15] Jesus was a God prophet, but the prophet
[1:12:19] was the veil,
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; but the word that was in him was God.
[1:12:25] [Applause]
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Now I want to say that again. So the
[1:12:29] prophet is the veil and the word that is
[1:12:32] in him is God.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ is the veil
[1:12:37] and the word that's in her is God.
[1:12:42] And you have to understand that the
[1:12:44] deity part never gets watered down.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; It can't become diluted.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the word wasn't less in Jesus
[1:12:53] than it was in God himself.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; The the word went out from God and Jesus
[1:12:59] was the word because the word was made
[1:13:02] flesh.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; And so now the veil and the word merged
[1:13:07] together in one body. And he had to take
[1:13:10] that body to Calvary and pay the
[1:13:14] ultimate price, pay the absolute
[1:13:17] sacrifice. And all men that received
[1:13:21] this, all men that were ordained to
[1:13:23] receive it, and I'm going to come to
[1:13:25] predestination. All men that were
[1:13:27] ordained to say it were absolutely free
[1:13:30] of sin.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; God paid the price. And actually, God
[1:13:36] wants to wave. Listen to me now and
[1:13:38] believe it. God wants to wave the the
[1:13:42] sinners that Satan Satan took sinners
[1:13:44] and dragged them to the very depths of
[1:13:47] sin. And God said, "I paid the price for
[1:13:51] him. He's free.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; I paid the price for her. She's free."
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Now, he talks about, now just stay with
[1:14:00] that. He talks about him coming down,
[1:14:03] how he came down
[1:14:06] and he talks about I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:14:08] bring it right to you sitting here and
[1:14:10] he he he refers to himself. God refers
[1:14:13] to himself and that is how he came down.
[1:14:17] Christ was in Moses. Christ was in
[1:14:20] Enoch. Christ was in uh Abraham. Christ
[1:14:25] was in Isaac. What was he doing? He said
[1:14:28] that's how he came down
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; and that's how God came down because the
[1:14:33] uh the final end of this was these all
[1:14:37] expressed faith somehow along the way.
[1:14:40] And when they expressed faith that's the
[1:14:43] sin unbelief.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; It's not what you did.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; That's not that's the attributes of sin.
[1:14:51] Aren't you glad for a message? Those are
[1:14:54] the attributes of sin. That's what
[1:14:56] sinful people do. Uh but you're you're
[1:15:01] all humanity have had uh extreme
[1:15:04] failures someplace along the line. At
[1:15:07] least Satan tells you that the are bad
[1:15:11] bad people because you did or thought or
[1:15:14] whatever said a certain word or whatever
[1:15:17] more. But now
[1:15:21] help me now. Amen.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; He had to become flesh and he was
[1:15:27] without sin.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; But he took that body uh of the earth
[1:15:33] and he was considered sinful although he
[1:15:36] was not sinful.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus was without sin but he took a
[1:15:41] perfect body in a perfect sacrifice to
[1:15:45] the death.
[1:15:46] And it was sinful men that judged him
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; and found him guilty and worthy of
[1:15:51] death. And it was their penalty that he
[1:15:54] was paying.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; It was our penalty that he was paying.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; I want to announce to you, your debt has
[1:16:02] been paid.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; You cannot add anything to his price.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; He paid the full debt. There's nothing
[1:16:10] you can add to it. It's not Calvary
[1:16:13] Plus. It's Calvary and Calvary alone.
[1:16:16] And God looked upon that sacrifice and
[1:16:19] when he said, "My father, my God, my
[1:16:22] God, why hast thou forsaken me?" He paid
[1:16:25] the full price. There's nothing you can
[1:16:27] add to it.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; There's nothing you can do to be
[1:16:32] accepted of God.
[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:38] And when he paid the full price, he this
[1:16:41] is how he came down.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; And you read it in in Matthew 1 and1
[1:16:47] says, "This is the generation of Jesus
[1:16:49] Christ, the son of Abraham, the son of
[1:16:52] David." Excuse me, the son of David. The
[1:16:57] son of David who sent a man to the war
[1:17:00] so he could bet get killed so David
[1:17:03] could have his wife Ba Sheba. And out of
[1:17:06] Basheba will come Solomon. Uh are you
[1:17:10] are you kidding me?
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what happened? And he had a
[1:17:15] child with Basheba before he killed his
[1:17:18] her husband.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Or Moses who murdered a man. No. The
[1:17:23] price Calvary paid it all.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; And incidentally, I said to my wife
[1:17:30] because I was so thrilled over it. He I
[1:17:32] said, "God wants to hold the redeemed
[1:17:36] and shake them in the face of Satan. You
[1:17:38] You cause this man to murder, but I call
[1:17:41] him free. He's my prophet." And he led a
[1:17:45] people out and I delivered them out of
[1:17:48] out of Pharaoh's hand. You you you you
[1:17:51] caused this woman uh of Tamar and And
[1:17:55] she'll be in the motherhood ancestry of
[1:17:58] Jesus.
[1:18:00] And she took a seed of her own
[1:18:02] father-in-law. Oh, horrors. Horrors, not
[1:18:06] horrors to God. There's nothing so dark.
[1:18:09] There's nothing so evil that he cannot
[1:18:11] forgive because he decreed he would
[1:18:15] forgive.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Those that would believe him.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; That's the key.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Some believe and some do not believe.
[1:18:24] You do not believe, you'll go to hell.
[1:18:27] That's all there is to it. because there
[1:18:29] is no redemption. But if you believe,
[1:18:32] and some of you that think you don't
[1:18:34] believe, you can't even leave it because
[1:18:37] you do believe.
[1:18:39] You know that you believe.
[1:18:41] You're born to believe. You have the
[1:18:44] seat of God. And God fornowledge. And
[1:18:48] this is what so many wise people and
[1:18:51] theologians can't get through their
[1:18:53] head. He whom he forneew.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. them. He predestinated.
[1:18:59] He forneew because he is the God that
[1:19:01] cannot learn. He looked down, the
[1:19:03] prophet said, through the stream of time
[1:19:06] and saw who would believe. He knew that
[1:19:09] you would believe. And because you would
[1:19:11] believe, he predestinated you. And he
[1:19:15] put a seed within you.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Before you came, he put a seed within
[1:19:21] you.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; So you could not doubt it.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; You had to believe it.
[1:19:26] Just try to turn away from it. You
[1:19:29] cannot.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And he wants to hold the redeemed
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; in the face of his arch enemy.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Satan, you got angels out of heaven,
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; but now these are my sons and daughters.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And some of them you took by cancer,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; but I healed them. I paid for their
[1:19:56] price of healing. Some of them you
[1:19:59] caused to go to an early grave. Some of
[1:20:02] them you did this or you did that. But I
[1:20:05] hold them before you as a redeemed of
[1:20:08] the Lord. I have redeemed them.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; And some of them went into dark
[1:20:13] denominations.
[1:20:15] Some of them like my father was an alter
[1:20:18] boy in a Catholic church. But I called
[1:20:21] him.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; I spoke to his soul. He gave himself to
[1:20:27] me.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; And he's redeemed. And I hold him before
[1:20:32] you as a redeemed
[1:20:35] be. And how did he do it? He came and
[1:20:37] the word became flesh.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; The word became flesh.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And then beyond that, just listen to
[1:20:44] this. The the flesh man was virgin born.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; The first Adam was created and formed.
[1:20:54] But this Adam was virgin born. Even the
[1:20:58] womb that he went to, he only could be
[1:21:01] the the the the prophet said that the
[1:21:04] listen now the words of the prophets. I
[1:21:07] love this. The words of the prophet
[1:21:10] anchored
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; into the womb of Mary
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; because she said as a as you've spoken
[1:21:18] so be it unto me.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; She so be it unto me. When those two
[1:21:24] things merged, the very word of God
[1:21:28] which was pregnantated with life,
[1:21:30] conceived in her womb, the son of God,
[1:21:34] and God gave his own son for the sins of
[1:21:37] the world.
[1:21:39] [Applause]
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; And he can hold that price. It's been
[1:21:43] paid, Satan. Nothing you can do. There
[1:21:46] is no sin
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; that that blood will not purge. There's
[1:21:50] no darkness that that blood will not
[1:21:53] purge. There's no evil
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; that that blood will not purge.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Friends, I know what I'm talking about.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I've stood on the on the street in a man
[1:22:09] in white because he was in white because
[1:22:12] they turned him loose from from prison
[1:22:14] just to come to the meeting. And I was
[1:22:17] with several of them that had come from
[1:22:19] prison. Brother David,
[1:22:22] and the man who was standing beside me
[1:22:24] was a murderer.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Believe this message.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And I was so thankful he wasn't only in
[1:22:31] a white suit. He was in white because
[1:22:33] the prison pe guards put him in white.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; All of them were in white to identify
[1:22:39] themselves as prisoners. I thought, how
[1:22:42] appropriate. He's white inside.
[1:22:45] Snow White.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about color. I'm talking
[1:22:48] about cleanliness now.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Snow White.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't this marvelous?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; There isn't anything,
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; nothing on the earth that a man or woman
[1:23:05] can do or has done but what has been
[1:23:08] purged.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; That does not give us license to go out
[1:23:12] and live in sin. Not at all. No, that's
[1:23:15] not what it is. Or to live a sinful
[1:23:17] life.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; This is the full substance that God
[1:23:23] unveiled himself
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; in this age. And and the more that he
[1:23:28] further that he unveiled himself,
[1:23:32] it became more difficult for some to
[1:23:34] believe.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Some fact is I just t spoke with one of
[1:23:43] our brothers is going to be speaking
[1:23:45] today at uh in a little Pentecostal
[1:23:49] group.
[1:23:53] But one man said he was talking to him
[1:23:55] and he said as he talked to him he found
[1:23:58] that he was things were from the
[1:24:00] message.
[1:24:02] And then he discovered that the man the
[1:24:06] man said well I became a believer in
[1:24:08] Dubai
[1:24:09] and he says and I followed along. He
[1:24:11] said then I run into the serpent seed
[1:24:14] and I couldn't take it any further. So
[1:24:17] he pulled back one of our brothers from
[1:24:20] this church going to be with them today.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; We want to pray for them.
[1:24:27] Pray that God will open their eyes that
[1:24:28] they may see
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; glimpses of truth
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; thou hast for me.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Are you getting a little bit of a
[1:24:37] picture?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, God is not only wanting
[1:24:41] to wave before, and this is my language
[1:24:45] now, wave before the enemy. You tried to
[1:24:48] take them. You took them to an early
[1:24:50] grave. You tried to take them to a
[1:24:53] sinful grave, but I paid the price.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; I paid the price.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; In fact, is you tried to twist things so
[1:25:04] so terribly in the Old Testament that I
[1:25:07] took uh I took Ruth, a Moabitis, and
[1:25:10] brought her into Israel. I took Rahab, a
[1:25:14] harlot.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; How many men did she know? I have no
[1:25:17] idea. It makes no difference. I tell
[1:25:20] you, once God decreed that she was one
[1:25:22] of his children, and furthermore, I'm
[1:25:25] going to I'm going to wave it so much in
[1:25:28] the face of Satan. I want you people to
[1:25:29] hear it. I want you to take it to
[1:25:32] yourself.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; He took He took the the the the vilest.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; The vilest.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; He wanted to show the strength of
[1:25:42] Calvary. He took the vilest of sinners.
[1:25:45] Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul said he had blasphemed.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; I don't understand. I don't know what he
[1:25:52] said, but he became an apostle
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; and he recognized he was an apostle and
[1:25:57] he said he was an apostle.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; He never saw Jesus that we know of.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; But I tell you, he saw the pillar of
[1:26:04] fire. He recognized the age that he was
[1:26:08] in. Are you following me?
[1:26:10] And God did not only God did not only
[1:26:13] pay the price for them. He did not only
[1:26:16] wave this in front of Satan's face.
[1:26:19] Said, "You tried to you tried to make
[1:26:21] this man do this. You tried to make this
[1:26:24] woman do this. We don't know anything
[1:26:27] about Rahab except that she's in the
[1:26:29] motherhood ancestry of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:33] Jesus came here
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; and he was not ashamed to say Rahab is
[1:26:39] in my ancestry. I came down through
[1:26:42] that. I came down through Tamar. I came
[1:26:46] down through Bath Sheba. There's no sin.
[1:26:49] In fact is I'm glad I could pay the
[1:26:51] price.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And the word became flesh.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; And I just want to step back just a
[1:27:10] moment
[1:27:15] and and Satan himself took Jesus. The
[1:27:18] Bible says, "And the devil taketh him up
[1:27:20] into an exceeding high mountain and
[1:27:23] showeth him." Didn't only show you in
[1:27:28] this age.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; And this age, friends,
[1:27:32] You just be thankful you're able to live
[1:27:34] in this age
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; that gave gave gave God gave you the
[1:27:38] opportunity to live in the most
[1:27:40] deceptive age. You say praise God
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; I was able to live in the most deceptive
[1:27:46] age.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I was able to live with all
[1:27:49] these fancy gadgets and overcome the
[1:27:52] television and overcome television
[1:27:55] nothing new. The prophet said, our
[1:27:57] prophet said television was here when
[1:27:59] when when Elijah was here. Television
[1:28:02] was here all through the Old Testament.
[1:28:04] He said it just wasn't discovered till
[1:28:06] this time. Isn't it amazing? They were
[1:28:09] discovering things. And so were we
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; discovering things because even uh uh do
[1:28:15] we didn't go from a horse and buggy to a
[1:28:18] to a automobile and from an automobile
[1:28:20] to an airplane and from an airplane
[1:28:23] they've gone to astronauts. And the
[1:28:25] prophet stopped at astronauts says we
[1:28:27] got astronauts. Elijah was an astronaut.
[1:28:30] Enoch was an astronaut. They were caught
[1:28:33] up to heaven. Jesus was a chief
[1:28:36] astronaut.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And he stood on the earth
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; declaring that he was in heaven.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Even the son of man who is in heaven.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:28:50] And Jesus did all of that to show us we
[1:28:53] could live in any age.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; And it happened to be the age of
[1:28:58] Leodysia.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And to the angel of the church of
[1:29:02] Leodysa, right? And saith the amen and
[1:29:07] the true witness and the beginning of
[1:29:11] the creation of God.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; This is a different creation. And the
[1:29:16] prophet and I'll read it hopefully. This
[1:29:18] is another species.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; This is another type of people. This is
[1:29:22] a super church. This is a redeemed
[1:29:25] church. This is a church that's prepared
[1:29:28] for an exodus. This is not people who
[1:29:31] expect and need fancy things. We would
[1:29:34] meet in a church or in a barn if we
[1:29:37] needed to. We met in a log church. We
[1:29:40] met in a house. I personally sat on
[1:29:43] planks that were unplaned, just uh rough
[1:29:46] planks out of a right here in
[1:29:48] Cloverdale. Uh that we're not prepared
[1:29:51] in this building and all this fancy
[1:29:54] things that that this age provides. We
[1:29:56] don't need them.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; I can tell you what's in you would meet
[1:30:01] any place.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; You'd meet anywhere.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; I don't need to have this carpet.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I've walked on boards. I've walked in
[1:30:12] the Indian in the Indian shacks. It
[1:30:15] makes no difference. You see it the way
[1:30:17] it is right now. But listen friends, it
[1:30:20] hasn't always been this way. And I'm not
[1:30:22] interested in people that can just sit
[1:30:24] on nice pews. I'm interested in people
[1:30:26] that are rugged people.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; You understand what I mean?
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Believers are rugged people. When the
[1:30:35] prophet said that, he wasn't speaking
[1:30:36] of, you know, just
[1:30:39] shine our nails sort of thing. We're
[1:30:42] rugged people
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; and the thing that's in you will meet
[1:30:45] anywhere.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; There's people right today that are
[1:30:50] walking all day Saturday in the Congo to
[1:30:52] be in the church on Sunday. And I tell
[1:30:55] you friends, if you had to walk, you
[1:30:57] would walk.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; That hunger would drive you.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Is that true, brother
[1:31:04] Daniel? They'll walk all day Saturday.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; To be in church on Sunday.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; I've seen it myself.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; That's not some ancient time. That's
[1:31:16] now. That's today.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Why am I saying this? Why are you
[1:31:22] preaching like this, Brother Biscll? I'm
[1:31:24] preaching like this because we're not
[1:31:26] we're not given over to be a bunch of
[1:31:28] soft dish rags. Come on.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; We've been made this way and we come a
[1:31:35] long ways, friends. But don't ever don't
[1:31:37] ever let uh uh this age
[1:31:42] veil. Satan himself is veiled in beauty.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; He's veiled in celebrity.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; He's veiled in that in in in
[1:31:55] well things are it's hard to describe.
[1:31:59] very hard to describe.
[1:32:02] I had a difficult time the last week or
[1:32:05] two. Not difficult within myself, but
[1:32:08] difficult to think that the taxes we pay
[1:32:14] are paying for people within the
[1:32:17] government
[1:32:21] in Canada.
[1:32:23] I'm ashamed to say this, and I should
[1:32:25] perhaps not say it over a pulpit, but
[1:32:28] they're wanting to pass a bill that
[1:32:29] makes it illegal
[1:32:33] to identify
[1:32:37] or
[1:32:39] uh diminish the importance of
[1:32:43] transgender.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; True. And they had
[1:32:48] they had gathered around them and the
[1:32:51] media is pushing it.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Who's pushing this thing?
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; What about the people that are solid
[1:33:00] family people?
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; What about the people that want to live
[1:33:04] clean?
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; What about the people that want to go to
[1:33:06] church
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; and have their children in Sunday
[1:33:09] school? What about these people? But yet
[1:33:12] the whole body, the whole government is
[1:33:15] seems driven by some spirit. And they
[1:33:18] are driven by a spirit. It's an unclean
[1:33:20] spirit. And it's Satan himself that's
[1:33:24] driving the thing. They can shut me
[1:33:26] down, but they can't shut me up.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; They can never shut the believer up.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Who's driving this thing? And a handful
[1:33:36] of people, five or six people, men who
[1:33:39] are obviously men who want to appear
[1:33:42] like a woman.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And what a shame. What a disgrace.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; They need to be read the riot act
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; and told what is right and what is right
[1:33:55] and get on and live like a man. Live the
[1:33:58] way you should. Live like a woman.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Go home and bake some cookies.
[1:34:04] said as standing as a flag person.
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I think that our prophet Messenger did
[1:34:15] such an honor to women when he said
[1:34:17] that, you know, standing with a big gun
[1:34:20] on their hip and something else and a
[1:34:21] billy club and and handcuffs. I'm not
[1:34:24] mocking. I'm saying that's no place for
[1:34:27] her.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; I got a queen sitting back here. You
[1:34:32] think I'd let Sister Biscll stand out
[1:34:34] there with a uh amongst all these
[1:34:36] cursing men and and have a gun on one
[1:34:40] side and handcuffs on the back? Handcuff
[1:34:42] who?
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Pepper spray who?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; That's not a woman's place. Stand out in
[1:34:50] the front and want to say, "Well, women
[1:34:53] want their freedom." That isn't freedom.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; That's terrible bondage. think I have to
[1:34:59] take a gun and or or whatever. I had two
[1:35:03] policemen at my door just a few days
[1:35:05] ago. Nothing bad.
[1:35:10] They actually came twice. They came
[1:35:12] twice. Nice fellas. I had them in the
[1:35:14] house and uh you know they can sense a
[1:35:18] different atmosphere.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Maybe they see the wife of the house and
[1:35:25] they they feel different.
[1:35:28] And they
[1:35:31] they they came around. I Well, I'll just
[1:35:33] tell you so and I'll tell the whole
[1:35:35] world.
[1:35:38] Uh
[1:35:39] they said
[1:35:42] they said you have a gun that's
[1:35:44] unregistered.
[1:35:47] Here's a car about a $60,000 car and and
[1:35:50] and two policemen and they're sitting
[1:35:52] waiting waiting waiting for me to tell
[1:35:55] me I have a gun that's unregistered.
[1:35:58] I said, "Which one?" Oh, they said, "You
[1:36:01] have more than one.
[1:36:07] Is this incredible?" I said, "You know
[1:36:09] what?" I said, "I'm paying you guys
[1:36:11] wages." He said, "That's right." I said
[1:36:14] I wanted them to know I'm paying your
[1:36:17] wages. I in fact is I was a little out
[1:36:19] of sorts. Not really. I just paid some
[1:36:21] taxes, you know, with tax income tax
[1:36:24] time. So we paid taxes. I said, "I'm
[1:36:26] paying your wages." Yeah. They said,
[1:36:27] "You are?" Yeah. And so they waited and
[1:36:30] waited and I they said, "Well, shall we
[1:36:32] come in?" I said, "No, I'll bring it
[1:36:34] out."
[1:36:36] So I said, "What caliber is it?" That's
[1:36:39] what they said. Oh, you got more than
[1:36:41] one.
[1:36:44] And to think that while I'm there down
[1:36:47] the street,
[1:36:50] you know,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; two doors down from me, a guy got
[1:36:53] blasted away right in his driveway.
[1:36:56] I don't live in a bad area. I live in a
[1:36:59] fairly decent area. But he got blasted
[1:37:01] away because he had a Lamborghini car
[1:37:03] out in front and he was a drug trader. I
[1:37:06] guess he was trading in drugs. and they
[1:37:09] got time to come by with all this
[1:37:11] equipment
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; and all this. This is our society. This
[1:37:15] is the direction it's going. And now I'm
[1:37:17] to accept and we're to accept and and uh
[1:37:22] you don't even know what the laws are.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; They're passing laws that you couldn't
[1:37:27] possibly keep.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And passing laws that you will not keep.
[1:37:31] You can't keep
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; and you're paying for them.
[1:37:37] And you people in America, exactly the
[1:37:40] same thing.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; You got laws that
[1:37:44] make lawful people criminals.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; We have laws. Now, I'm I'm on I'm on a
[1:37:55] case now. I'm on a run. So, just But
[1:37:57] I'll only be a moment. We got laws that
[1:38:00] insist that homes be broken up.
[1:38:05] We got laws that state that we can't
[1:38:08] pay. I know what I'm talking about.
[1:38:12] You the kind of pension you should get
[1:38:16] and the kind of pension your husband
[1:38:17] should get. But if you get a divorce, we
[1:38:20] could do it.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; You're quiet. You know how many times I
[1:38:28] faced that? Probably one, two, three
[1:38:30] times.
[1:38:32] And the pe believers come to me and
[1:38:34] said, "Should we get a divorce?"
[1:38:38] Why? Well, the government says,
[1:38:42] "We can pay you enough pension if you
[1:38:44] get a divorce."
[1:38:48] No. That that come from the throne of
[1:38:50] God, did it?
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; No. That come from the pit of hell.
[1:38:54] Amen.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And in each of those cases, none of them
[1:39:02] got divorced.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; And somehow it worked out.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Somehow it worked out.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; That happens to be the age that you're
[1:39:13] living in.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Now, I want I know I want you to listen.
[1:39:20] Now, I got your attention. I want you to
[1:39:22] listen real good.
[1:39:24] Your prophet talked about, now I'm
[1:39:26] taking this to you personally,
[1:39:29] he talked about the molder
[1:39:31] who molds the bells
[1:39:34] to give a certain tang
[1:39:38] and then he starts in the natural.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know what kind of life you maybe
[1:39:44] came from or what kind of background or
[1:39:46] how messed up you were or or how
[1:39:49] disgraced you are. Maybe you don't want
[1:39:51] to talk about your past,
[1:39:54] but he says he bred this one to this one
[1:39:58] and this one to this one and he bred
[1:40:00] this one to this one, this one to this
[1:40:03] one. And he stops. He says that's how he
[1:40:05] came down.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; That's how Jesus came down.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; He let Tamar do her in-laws made
[1:40:15] promises that they didn't keep. And so
[1:40:17] she had incest with her father-in-law.
[1:40:19] And then Rahab the harlot and she had
[1:40:22] men and whatever more and all these
[1:40:24] things carried on. Are you with me?
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say nothing. It doesn't say
[1:40:30] nothing about that in the New Testament.
[1:40:32] But Rahab ends up in the with the heroes
[1:40:35] of the faith in Hebrews 11.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; I'd love to have my name there. She has
[1:40:42] her name there.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; You know that that doesn't make her
[1:40:48] great. That's not the purpose of it. It
[1:40:50] makes Calvary great. It makes Jesus
[1:40:53] great.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God, brother Roy. This is
[1:40:58] something to thank God about. Has
[1:41:01] nothing to do about our past.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do about our past. And
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; then he says he bred this one to this
[1:41:11] one and this one to this one.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; And this one to this one.
[1:41:18] Listen to what the prophet said. You'll
[1:41:20] never hear it anywhere else until he got
[1:41:23] exactly
[1:41:25] what he wanted.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; I don't care who you are. If you're a
[1:41:32] believer
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; and you've been given a heart to
[1:41:36] believe,
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; God bred this one to that one and this
[1:41:40] one to that one. I'm talking about this
[1:41:42] natural person. This one to that one
[1:41:44] until he got exactly
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; what he wanted.
[1:41:52] [Applause]
[1:41:53] And that's how he came down
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; until he got exactly brother John,
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; brother Tip, exactly what he wanted.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; You know what that did to me? It start
[1:42:04] to break me up. I thought, "Oh, God.
[1:42:08] There's so many things I'm so
[1:42:11] disappointed in with myself."
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; But you got Exactly.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; I look across this congregation. I
[1:42:19] charge you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:42:22] to receive that word. That's a thus
[1:42:25] sayaith the Lord. He brought this one to
[1:42:28] that one and this one to that one till
[1:42:30] he got exactly what he wanted.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not using idol words. Exactly what
[1:42:38] he wanted.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; I wanted you to hear this, brother
[1:42:41] David. Until he got exactly what he
[1:42:44] wanted. I want this congregation to hear
[1:42:47] that. and to receive it and take it into
[1:42:50] themselves and say, "I will believe
[1:42:53] that." Until he got exactly what he
[1:42:56] wanted.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; I'm here as a son of God that he does
[1:43:02] not love halfway, but he loves 100%. I'm
[1:43:05] here as a daughter of God that he loves
[1:43:08] dearly.
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; You talk about grace.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's abundant grace.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; And when Satan showed Jesus all the all
[1:43:23] the kingdoms of the world, he was not
[1:43:26] impressed by it.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And neither should we be impressed.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; With what he dazzles before us today,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; what he hangs before us, all these
[1:43:36] dazzling things everywhere I go. And the
[1:43:40] more I've given myself to the message,
[1:43:42] the less it impresses me. I'm not
[1:43:45] impressed with the world. And we shall
[1:43:47] not be impressed with the world or the
[1:43:50] greatness of the world or the
[1:43:52] intelligence of the world or all of
[1:43:54] these things because if if Satan gets a
[1:43:57] hold of it, which he has,
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; this is his kingdom.
[1:44:05] And in this day
[1:44:12] after we'd had,
[1:44:17] you know, we have the
[1:44:20] all kinds of u
[1:44:22] documentaries and videos that are
[1:44:25] available to you of the war.
[1:44:29] Awitz.
[1:44:31] You were just at Awitz.
[1:44:34] Solemn experience.
[1:44:37] They have a memorial to it in Israel.
[1:44:41] Very somber.
[1:44:45] It's happening every day.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; It's happening every day.
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:44:59] And people take the message and they
[1:45:01] say, you know, Brother Bram uses the
[1:45:03] term atomic fodder.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, and we seem we're so self-righteous
[1:45:10] about it. Say, oh, that is so terrible.
[1:45:12] We don't want anybody to suffer.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; What about all the people in the
[1:45:17] graveyards?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; What about the untold billions that are
[1:45:22] in graveyards? They're already gone. So,
[1:45:25] let's not talk about those that are
[1:45:26] living. Let's talk about those that have
[1:45:28] gone. And while they were living, what
[1:45:30] were they doing
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; while they were living? Cursing,
[1:45:34] damning,
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; hating God, and then have some
[1:45:38] backsliding preacher put them into
[1:45:40] heaven.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Who Who wants that? Isn't that the
[1:45:44] epitome of hypocrisy?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Hear my words. Is that not so?
[1:45:52] You know, I know what I'm talking about.
[1:45:54] I've been through it.
[1:46:00] There was a man that passed away. I
[1:46:03] guess I just have too many accounts, but
[1:46:06] there was a man who passed away. He was
[1:46:08] related to a a woman in this church.
[1:46:14] And they told me, they said, "The family
[1:46:16] hasn't got anybody to. They don't even
[1:46:18] know a minister.
[1:46:23] Would you have a service for him?"
[1:46:28] For her sake, I said, "Yes,
[1:46:31] I'll have a service for him."
[1:46:35] I went to the funeral home and all his
[1:46:37] colleagues were gathered because he
[1:46:39] worked at a in a big union. all his
[1:46:42] colleagues were gathered and all, you
[1:46:44] know, hugging one another and so on. I
[1:46:46] that's fine. I just stood there
[1:46:51] and one was walking up just walked up
[1:46:54] past me carrying a white cowboy hat
[1:46:59] and God spoke to me. Do you believe you
[1:47:01] God speaks?
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; That's what makes this church special.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; God speaks.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; God says specific things. When I talk
[1:47:10] about Switzerland, I'm not talking about
[1:47:12] some convention. I'm talking about God
[1:47:14] speaking 10 12,000 miles away and saying
[1:47:17] this is a wounded one
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; and go and ask her. She is a wounded one
[1:47:22] and she's not wounded anymore.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Her her and her husband and a whole
[1:47:26] flock of people are healed. How
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; we ought to believe in the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; He's the one who speaks. He's the one
[1:47:34] who's saying things.
[1:47:36] He's the one who's drawing other people
[1:47:38] there.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; And God spoke to me and says
[1:47:42] he's a homosexual,
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; the one that's in the coffin. He's a
[1:47:46] homosexual. And this is his partner
[1:47:50] walking by with a cowboy hat. And I just
[1:47:54] watched him. I stepped to the door and
[1:47:56] watched him go in. He went to the
[1:47:57] coffin. He stood by the coffin.
[1:48:00] Now put yourself in my place. You think
[1:48:02] this is an easy place?
[1:48:06] It's not an easy place.
[1:48:09] And he lays the cowboy hat on his
[1:48:13] partner's body
[1:48:16] and he comes to walk back out and I made
[1:48:18] him at the door and I said, "He must
[1:48:21] have meant a lot to you." "Yeah," he
[1:48:23] said. He meant very much to me. And he
[1:48:26] started to get teary and he walked out.
[1:48:32] They think I'm going to put him in
[1:48:33] heaven.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Not a chance.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; That's not my place.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; So, I just told my wife about it. The
[1:48:46] only reason I'm talking about it now is
[1:48:48] I just told my wife about it last night.
[1:48:51] I said I just got up and I spoke about
[1:48:53] the life of the the life that God put in
[1:48:55] the botney life and the plants and the
[1:48:58] flowers and things and how they come up
[1:49:01] and each year. And I just talked about
[1:49:04] the life of God.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; That was it.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Let them go wherever God says he shall
[1:49:12] go.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; We're done with hypocrisy in the church.
[1:49:18] Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; We're done with this. Weak need
[1:49:22] Leodysian age.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; The prophet said they need to get uh
[1:49:28] just preachers with uh gloves on.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; And say it the way it is.
[1:49:35] [Applause]
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; It's time for us and you in America and
[1:49:43] wherever you come from in the world to
[1:49:45] stand up for truth.
[1:49:50] Let the chips fall where they may.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not impressed with Satan's
[1:49:57] kingdoms and the glory of them.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; And neither are we impressed.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; We're not impressed.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; They may have the buses and the
[1:50:05] airplanes and all these things and to
[1:50:08] make the life easier and more beautiful
[1:50:11] cars and more beautiful clothes and all
[1:50:13] of us. It's all going to perish.
[1:50:15] And the prophet says it's going to be
[1:50:17] burned up.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And I say in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:50:22] bring it on.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; We talk about a change. We're not going
[1:50:27] to be changed just in in all the flowery
[1:50:30] things. That's not what's changing us.
[1:50:32] It's the word of God that's changing us.
[1:50:35] And you people that have read and have
[1:50:38] been in the unveiling of God, and if you
[1:50:40] have not yet, you shall, you should. And
[1:50:43] it will you'll run into lots of things
[1:50:45] you do not understand. When you can't
[1:50:48] understand it, you'll say, "Praise God,
[1:50:50] this is beyond this puny brain of mine."
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, and he had
[1:50:59] several thousand in front of him, that's
[1:51:02] in the unveiling of God. And he had
[1:51:05] several thousand in front of them. He
[1:51:07] says
[1:51:09] to the thousands, "Except you eat the
[1:51:12] flesh of the son of man and drink his
[1:51:16] blood, you have no life in you."
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; And that was it.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says they left him.
[1:51:27] Your Bible does not say that he sent
[1:51:30] visitation committees after them.
[1:51:34] Your Bible does not say, "Oh," he said,
[1:51:36] "wait a moment. Wait a moment. Now, let
[1:51:38] me explain that."
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't need to explain it.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; And that is why the prophet in this day
[1:51:44] spoke the opening of the seven seals
[1:51:46] with a period at the end and said,
[1:51:48] "That's thus, sayith the Lord. That's
[1:51:50] the end of it."
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; He never came back to explain it the
[1:51:54] second time. That's what it is.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; It is what it is.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Is it okay?
[1:52:03] Hallelujah.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; He showed him the glory
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; and that was it.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; And he shows us his glory.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And we want to announce to the Satan, to
[1:52:23] all of his hordes, to every demon spirit
[1:52:26] that he will bring up. We want to let
[1:52:29] him know that whether whether he would
[1:52:32] get fancier or more or or more refined
[1:52:35] or more cultured or more whatever, we
[1:52:39] are not here to accept
[1:52:42] his devices. We're not here to accept
[1:52:45] his ways. We're not here to accept his
[1:52:48] language. We're not here to accept all
[1:52:50] the fine things and the community. We're
[1:52:54] not We don't need a community, friends.
[1:52:56] We have the body of Christ.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; That's why this school over here for you
[1:53:06] young people are in school. That's why
[1:53:08] the school said that you young people
[1:53:11] shall not have cell phones.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; And called the parents. And the parents
[1:53:17] said,
[1:53:20] "If you're going to allow your children
[1:53:22] to have those,
[1:53:24] don't come and enroll the kids." Do you
[1:53:26] know why? Because there's so much vile
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; and vulgar
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; and damning and unclean things.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; You might be washed nice on the outside,
[1:53:40] but your soul
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; is unclean.
[1:53:44] and taking and feeding on those things.
[1:53:47] We cannot feed on those things. And
[1:53:49] what's good for the young people is good
[1:53:51] for the adults as well. We cannot feed
[1:53:54] on those things. We cannot feed on those
[1:53:57] things. You I if they've had a hold on
[1:54:00] you and there have been believers that
[1:54:02] have had a hold on you, you want to say,
[1:54:05] "God, give me deliverance.
[1:54:08] Jesus Christ, you paid the price for me
[1:54:11] to be free from these things." And whom
[1:54:13] the Son sets free shall be free indeed.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; You know why I'm preaching this way?
[1:54:22] Because I know how cunning he is.
[1:54:26] [Applause]
[1:54:29] He makes things so
[1:54:32] desirable,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; so enticing,
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; that scarcely,
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; scarcely the believer would be saved.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; It's just exactly the way it is.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; And he brings on he brings on pressures.
[1:54:53] I hadn't intended on going into all of
[1:54:55] this. In fact, is I had decided I
[1:54:56] wouldn't. But then here I am.
[1:55:01] But he makes so much pressures, economic
[1:55:04] pressures,
[1:55:06] uh different kinds of pressures,
[1:55:14] pressures on the young men and young
[1:55:16] ladies
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; to go into areas
[1:55:20] of maybe areas of education.
[1:55:23] that you ought not to go into.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Says, "Well,
[1:55:35] our daughter Joanne wanted to go to
[1:55:39] nursing."
[1:55:41] So, my wife and I drove her to where the
[1:55:44] signed into nursing. It's a very intense
[1:55:47] program. You only get two days off in a
[1:55:49] year.
[1:55:51] And after two years, you're an RN.
[1:55:56] And after one year, you're a registered
[1:55:59] uh
[1:56:03] practical nurse.
[1:56:07] So, we got into the reception room
[1:56:12] and there the whole wall
[1:56:15] is all fractured.
[1:56:18] Fractured. The whole wall of of of of
[1:56:23] wallpaper all around the reception room
[1:56:25] is all fractured. And there were some
[1:56:28] images, some kind of images. And I was
[1:56:31] trying to figure it out. I'm sitting
[1:56:33] there waiting, waiting. I'm looking at
[1:56:35] these images. You know what it was? A
[1:56:38] hard rock band.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; It was a picture of a hard rock band.
[1:56:43] And all the whole wall was all
[1:56:45] fractured. And I I you know, thank God
[1:56:49] for the word of God. I just said it's
[1:56:52] those guys that have fractured the
[1:56:54] people,
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Those guys, that whole spirit has sent
[1:56:59] the people bazoonis and now they're
[1:57:01] going to go through a whole education of
[1:57:04] nursing and everything try to put it
[1:57:06] back together again.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; What a deception.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? Do you think I've gone
[1:57:12] off the head? And so I I said to my
[1:57:14] daughter, "Have a look at that." I said,
[1:57:16] I said that's why that's why they need
[1:57:18] to give you psychology.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Try to put people together
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; and then ask a question. Why are they
[1:57:25] this way? They don't even realize that
[1:57:27] they've invited
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; the very the very spirit of things.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Friends, we haven't only got it. You
[1:57:38] know, they talked about when when the
[1:57:39] bra prophet was here, when brother
[1:57:40] Brandham was here, they had te
[1:57:42] televisions in uh in in uh uh into the
[1:57:46] house. He said it brought Hollywood.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Hollywood's a hell hole.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; You call those people celebrities,
[1:57:55] you wouldn't want them as your neighbor.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; And the whole world goes into a am I
[1:58:04] being too critical?
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; No. the whole world goes into a a mode
[1:58:08] of a weeping mode for for people. Well,
[1:58:12] he just uh perished or she just perished
[1:58:14] at at 32 years old or 37 years old or 41
[1:58:18] or 51 or whatever it is, you know, from
[1:58:21] a drug overdose and they want you to cry
[1:58:23] over that.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Isn't this this is our society. Do you
[1:58:30] think God shedding tears over that?
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; No. Not. He's He did everything.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; And people always don't listen to me,
[1:58:39] congregation. I'm not going on and on,
[1:58:41] but don't mistake the age that we're in.
[1:58:45] And don't mistake the the kind of result
[1:58:48] that you have and the kind of feeling.
[1:58:51] And don't apologize. Something rises
[1:58:53] within you and say it's wrong.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; That's not the way I live.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; That's not the way our home shall be.
[1:59:03] You young ladies that are are expecting
[1:59:06] to get married, you wait on God.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; You young men expecting to get married,
[1:59:11] you wait on God.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; And let God do the work.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Don't get in any panic mode.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; I can tell you home is heaven or hell.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Not as many amens that time,
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; but that's the way it is.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; You that are married, God is the answer.
[1:59:29] Christ is the answer
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; and the word is the answer.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:35] [Applause]
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; You know what, brother John, help me.
[1:59:43] I'm going to take my coat off.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; I want to preach the last few minutes.
[2:00:00] One thing we all know, we all know where
[2:00:02] we kind of came from.
[2:00:07] You people don't know where I came from.
[2:00:11] But I came from a very, very harsh
[2:00:13] background. Not harsh and sinful, harsh
[2:00:17] in loneliness.
[2:00:21] I know you were way back, brother
[2:00:23] Nathan, way back in Idaho and way back
[2:00:26] in the wilderness, but I was in the
[2:00:28] wilderness alone.
[2:00:34] I lived in camps,
[2:00:37] not for days or weeks, but months and
[2:00:40] months and months in bitter cold
[2:00:44] with nothing.
[2:00:48] practly nothing.
[2:00:51] And I thought in the last few days,
[2:00:54] brother Daniel, I've thought of much
[2:00:56] about I thought, God,
[2:00:59] you brought me from there
[2:01:05] to have friends all over the world and
[2:01:09] uh have people in the church and the
[2:01:12] people who will come. I could scarcely
[2:01:13] believe it.
[2:01:17] I admire you people for coming to the
[2:01:19] church. I'm thankful that the brothers
[2:01:22] give me opportunity to preach. But I'm
[2:01:24] pouring my heart out.
[2:01:27] And I say to you in all sincerity, this
[2:01:29] is not because of my age. This is an
[2:01:31] awful age.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; This is an awful, awful age. Amen.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; And when I was in my teens, drugs were
[2:01:39] just coming in
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; and people were taking drugs and they
[2:01:45] wanted, you know, me to get involved.
[2:01:48] I wasn't in I I I didn't have it in me.
[2:01:51] It just wasn't there.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; And when I say that God even bred this
[2:01:57] one to that one and this one to that one
[2:01:59] and this one to that one until he got
[2:02:01] the right thing until he got exactly
[2:02:04] what he wanted. Brother Nathan, he got
[2:02:06] exactly what he wanted.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Brother David, he got exactly what he
[2:02:11] wanted. Brother Ernie, I know some of
[2:02:13] our backgrounds are maybe horror
[2:02:15] stories, but he brought one to another
[2:02:18] until he got the right thing.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; And he got exactly what he wanted. And I
[2:02:23] want you to be able to sit here today
[2:02:25] and say, I'm exactly what he wanted.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Whatever country you come from, whatever
[2:02:33] culture you come from,
[2:02:35] He got exactly what he wanted.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; I'm looking down into your faces because
[2:02:41] God has laid this upon my heart. He got
[2:02:44] exactly what he wanted, Sister Lisa.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; He just he brought one to the other and
[2:02:49] one to the other because he knew what he
[2:02:51] was going to do on the spiritual side.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; On the spiritual side,
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; young man, on the spiritual side, he saw
[2:03:00] you as his son,
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; his daughter. And I'm going to I'm going
[2:03:05] to I'm going to begin a new creation.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; And they're not part of the old
[2:03:10] creation. They're part of the new
[2:03:12] creation. I'm going to start it I'm
[2:03:14] going to start it with blood. My own
[2:03:16] blood.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to start it with my own blood.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; And in this blood is no traits of sin.
[2:03:26] In this blood is nothing. In this blood
[2:03:28] is only to go the way of the word. And
[2:03:30] in this blood will be in one called
[2:03:33] Jesus Christ. And he will take the
[2:03:36] cursed earth. He will take it to
[2:03:38] Calvary. He'll take the sins of the
[2:03:41] world. And all who believe upon him, who
[2:03:44] believe upon him shall be saved.
[2:03:48] [Applause]
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Who wants to stay here? Who wants to
[2:03:52] stay in this mess? Who wants to stay in
[2:03:54] this conglomeration? I say with the
[2:03:57] Apostle John, even so, Lord Jesus, come.
[2:04:01] [Applause]
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I announce to you, you're
[2:04:05] made for another place.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; You hungler for another place. No wonder
[2:04:11] we talk about a change. You are you are
[2:04:14] destined
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; for a change.
[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:18] [Applause]
[2:04:20] When you're in the message
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; in the message of unveiling of God, the
[2:04:25] prophet is simply simply saying that
[2:04:28] he's unveiled to the believer.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; He's veiled to the unbeliever.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; He's veiled in the prophet. He's veiled
[2:04:37] in Moses. He's dwells on that. He was
[2:04:40] veiled in the prophet. He was so strong
[2:04:42] upon that. He was so veiled in Moses
[2:04:45] that when Moses received the word and
[2:04:48] came out, they had to put a veil over
[2:04:50] his face. So the people could not look
[2:04:53] upon him because he had he was the word
[2:04:56] of God to the people. And somehow people
[2:04:59] think that God in a prophet today will
[2:05:01] be something less. It's nothing less.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; And that thought comes from the devil.
[2:05:09] And the reason why the devil wants you
[2:05:11] to think that is because that word then
[2:05:13] comes through the prophet to you
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; and you become the veil.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; And he and Satan doesn't want that.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Satan is fighting against that.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; He hates that truth. And that I
[2:05:27] struggled with it this week. Satan hates
[2:05:30] that. It's not less a word friends on
[2:05:33] the balconies. It's the same word that
[2:05:36] came out of the bosom of the father,
[2:05:38] came down into the flesh and became
[2:05:40] Jesus Christ. And Jesus said, "I don't
[2:05:43] leave you coverless. I will come to
[2:05:45] you." And it won't be it won't just be
[2:05:48] you and the father up there and the Holy
[2:05:50] Ghost somewhere. It'll be we will be in
[2:05:53] you
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; even to the end of the consummation.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Something less, no, nothing less. The
[2:06:01] same God, the same God will be in you.
[2:06:05] And theologians would say, "What are you
[2:06:07] trying to make us?" We're trying to make
[2:06:09] us what Jesus said we were.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Trying to make us that these weak people
[2:06:14] will believe the word of God. Friends,
[2:06:17] I'm getting tired. I'm getting weak. But
[2:06:20] this has been a spiritual battle. Satan
[2:06:22] hasn't wanted me to get this to you. But
[2:06:25] don't be caught up in this world. This
[2:06:27] world is going to perish.
[2:06:32] This world is going to perish.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; And you shall walk out on the ashes
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; of the wicked.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; That's what the word of God says.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; You shall walk out on the ashes.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; I say you don't want to miss that.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; That's one march you want to be in.
[2:06:58] That's one walk you want to be on. We
[2:07:00] have all the community walks today.
[2:07:02] We're going to walk for cancer and walk
[2:07:04] for this and walk for that. Oh, when we
[2:07:07] walk on that walk I'm talking about is
[2:07:09] the walk of the redeemed.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; When the redeemed goal
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Just five more minutes. Amen.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Now in this world, this has nothing to
[2:07:38] do with our school.
[2:07:40] We think that people should be in it as
[2:07:42] much as possible. Now in this world that
[2:07:45] we live in, this is the third last
[2:07:48] service the prophet preached.
[2:07:51] This is where in this chapter, show us
[2:07:55] the father. Amen.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you Jesus was showing
[2:08:00] them the father. How is it, Philillip,
[2:08:02] you say, "Show us the father." And I've
[2:08:04] been with you so long and you haven't
[2:08:05] seen the father. His third last service
[2:08:09] laying laying a word that would be read
[2:08:11] in this age,
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; in your age. You've got the tape. You've
[2:08:16] got it on your iPad. You've got it
[2:08:19] somewhere available to you. You need to
[2:08:21] hear it. This is the service. And he
[2:08:24] spoke in there. And he said now in this
[2:08:25] world that we live in
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; that you live in
[2:08:32] in this education I want to prove you
[2:08:35] prove to you education
[2:08:38] science civilization and all is now the
[2:08:43] same thing is in this civilization
[2:08:46] altogether we read we write we do this
[2:08:50] we don't never get it but don't never
[2:08:52] get adjusted to Amen. Amen.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; You've got to work. You've got to pay
[2:08:57] your bills. You drive a car. You've got
[2:08:59] to gas up. You got to pay rent or you've
[2:09:02] got to buy a home or something. But
[2:09:04] don't never get adjusted to that.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Don't let that be the boss.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Don't let that ever be in control. You
[2:09:19] control it. Use it. use it for the
[2:09:22] kingdom of God. And you can kind of be a
[2:09:25] little uh uh uh what shall I say? You
[2:09:29] know, you're on the inside. I've got an
[2:09:31] inside track. I know a little bit about
[2:09:34] this. I'm kind of a secret agent for the
[2:09:36] Holy Ghost. I belong to another kingdom.
[2:09:39] I don't even belong to the society. I'm
[2:09:42] another race. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:09:46] Yeah, we have people from Africa, from
[2:09:48] China, from Japan, from wherever. But
[2:09:50] we're of another race. We have another
[2:09:53] passport called the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; We're from another country.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; People of the world will listen to this
[2:10:01] kind of preaching and say, "He's a
[2:10:02] bigot. He's something else. I'm not. I'm
[2:10:05] a Holy Ghost fil preacher." Hallelujah.
[2:10:08] That believes the words of Jesus Christ.
[2:10:11] And I'll say to this world, you're the
[2:10:13] people that crucified Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:10:16] I'm the people that believed he came out
[2:10:17] of the grave. I'm the one who believes
[2:10:20] he's still alive today. I believe he's
[2:10:23] still doing the supernatural things.
[2:10:26] He's still delivering people. He's still
[2:10:28] healing people. He's the same yesterday,
[2:10:31] today, and forever. And you young people
[2:10:34] especially, you ought to rejoice and
[2:10:36] say, "Thank God. That's my God. That's
[2:10:40] my Jesus. That's my kind of preaching."
[2:10:43] Hallelujah.
[2:10:44] Hallelujah. I'm so glad I'm in that
[2:10:46] number.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:10:53] [Applause]
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Some of you might say, "Well, I haven't
[2:11:03] experienced all those things, Brother
[2:11:05] Ed. Just wait. I've been a lot further
[2:11:08] down the road." And incidentally, the
[2:11:12] word of God says to me, you elders, you
[2:11:14] tell the children.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; And it says to you, don't move the old
[2:11:19] landmarks, old landmarks.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; What I saw, what I've experienced is the
[2:11:28] same God.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; He held me in childhood. He held me in
[2:11:32] my mother's death.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; He held me when I when there were all
[2:11:35] kinds of temptations. He held me when
[2:11:38] drugs were coming into the world. He
[2:11:40] held me when uh all kinds of fancy
[2:11:42] things and they wanted to uh you know
[2:11:45] race the cars. I didn't have it in me to
[2:11:48] race the cars. I just didn't care for
[2:11:50] those things. And the girls came along.
[2:11:52] Oh yeah, the girls. And they're the
[2:11:54] flooy, you know, flooy girls. And they
[2:11:57] they wanted I'm not talking about you
[2:11:58] sisters. I'm talking about those of the
[2:12:00] world. But it had no attraction to me.
[2:12:03] Hallelujah. I was attracted to something
[2:12:06] in God's word. I thought, God, you said
[2:12:09] something about this. Did I know
[2:12:11] understand the Bible? No, I didn't
[2:12:13] understand the Bible. But I believe the
[2:12:15] Bible and I'm saying it to you as a
[2:12:17] witness today. In my youth, I believe
[2:12:20] this Bible. And as a young preacher, I
[2:12:22] believe this Bible. When I met the
[2:12:24] prophet of God, I met this Bible. And
[2:12:26] here I am today. I still believe the
[2:12:29] same word of God. I saw it work when I
[2:12:32] was young. I've seen it work when I was
[2:12:34] old and I'm here to say it works.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, it works. And the word
[2:12:41] of God is true. True.
[2:12:46] [Music]
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Yesterday
[2:12:53] I stood by the ocean.
[2:12:57] My wife is standing beside me.
[2:13:00] I said, you know, I said, somehow God
[2:13:03] humiliates us.
[2:13:05] I said that, see those old black stones
[2:13:07] down there, just millions of them. See
[2:13:10] those waves coming in? Waves lapping up
[2:13:13] against the stones. You say, "Well,
[2:13:15] that's nothing. That's just the ocean."
[2:13:17] Hey, I'm a man.
[2:13:20] I was supposed to be the epitome of
[2:13:22] God's creation.
[2:13:24] This water was here when God first
[2:13:26] spoke. Yeah,
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; this water's been lapping up against it.
[2:13:29] What What are these stones worth?
[2:13:32] Next to nothing. What's these stones
[2:13:34] worth? Nothing. Just black stones. What
[2:13:38] are they worth? What am I worth?
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm humiliated.
[2:13:44] I may be gone in a short time. Those
[2:13:46] stones will still be here. The water
[2:13:48] will still be here lapping up. I'm so
[2:13:51] glad that friends, if you can't say, you
[2:13:54] want to say before the service is over,
[2:13:56] the God that made that water, the God
[2:13:58] that put those stones there, that God is
[2:14:01] my father.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And his life is my life.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; As he lives, so I live.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. He paid my penalty.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what Satan pokes down
[2:14:16] my memory lane. I can say, "It's
[2:14:18] forgiven. It's forgiven. I'm washed
[2:14:21] whiter than the snow.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm going to sing? I'm
[2:14:31] going to rejoice
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; when the redeemed are gathering in.
[2:14:34] Brother
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Ryan, hallelujah. Nice to see you,
[2:14:39] Brother Jim. Such a joy.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The brother that sang, I
[2:14:43] understand he's from Brother McGary's
[2:14:45] church
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; and the choir. God bless them. Amen.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; But now we're going to sing.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; You young people got a voice.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; You want to sing for brother Biscll?
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Sing when the redeemed are gathering in
[2:15:00] wash like snow and free from all sin.
[2:15:03] You think we're fanatics? You want to go
[2:15:05] to the next NBA game.
[2:15:08] I tell you what. And are they waving in
[2:15:11] the hockey game and they're waving and
[2:15:13] all these people and they're not nuts.
[2:15:17] We're supposed to be nuts.
[2:15:19] [Music]
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. Is this Is this too
[2:15:23] sanctified here?
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; No. When a redeemed are gathering in.
[2:15:30] You think that's just a dream? That's a
[2:15:33] reality.
[2:15:34] I don't know how, but we're going to
[2:15:36] walk in.
[2:15:38] And the prophet said, "We'll sit down,
[2:15:40] Brother Jim, across from one another,
[2:15:42] and tears of joy will come down our
[2:15:44] face." And then the king himself will
[2:15:47] come in and he'll wipe the tears. Say,
[2:15:50] "Don't weep anymore, children. It's all
[2:15:53] over. It's all over, Brother Andes. The
[2:15:56] battle will be over. Glory to God. Glory
[2:16:00] to God. Glory to God." How do you feel
[2:16:02] about it up in your balcony? Praise God.
[2:16:07] Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you going to be there?
[2:16:14] Yes. Yes, we're going to be there.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Sing when the redeemer gather. I tell
[2:16:21] you,
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; I am on the rapture.
[2:16:27] I will be
[2:16:31] happy.
[2:16:34] I will raise the heaven and the city in
[2:16:39] the sky.
[2:16:40] [Music]
[2:16:43] I got
[2:16:46] [Music]
[2:16:50] again.
[2:16:54] [Music]
[2:16:58] Oh, how shout,
[2:17:02] [Music]
[2:17:10] you know, when we sing that course,
[2:17:12] those that are going to be baptized, if
[2:17:14] you'll go now and prepare for baptism,
[2:17:16] Brother Murphy will meet you and your
[2:17:18] your
[2:17:20] friends and
[2:17:23] we'll be with you when you're getting
[2:17:24] ready. As soon as they come, they're
[2:17:27] going to have the baptism right away.
[2:17:29] But when I sing this course, when the
[2:17:32] redeemed are gathering,
[2:17:35] I will sing.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm doing now. And I will
[2:17:39] shout. Glory to God. I just can't say it
[2:17:42] as a whisper. I will sing. And I will
[2:17:46] shout. I will sing when the redeemed are
[2:17:49] gathering in. Glory to God. Let me just
[2:17:54] have a personal a personal time of joy

[2:17:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; You'll forgive me, Brother David.
[2:18:10] Yesterday, I woke up very early in the
[2:18:12] morning with this young man's name on my
[2:18:16] mind,
[2:18:17] and I couldn't shake it. And I couldn't
[2:18:19] shake it. I got more nervous. David more
[2:18:22] nervous till I couldn't lay in bed
[2:18:25] anymore and I just threw the covers back
[2:18:27] and head to my office and sent you a
[2:18:30] little email. Thank you for answering
[2:18:33] back. Then you sent me another one this
[2:18:36] morning. Said I'll be in church. I'll be
[2:18:39] praying for you. And in my heart I I
[2:18:42] wanted to say be sitting in your same
[2:18:44] seat.
[2:18:46] But that was just my desire but God gave
[2:18:48] me my desire. Thank you, brother David.
[2:18:51] Hallelujah.
[2:18:53] Never give up.
[2:18:59] There is no weapon,
[2:19:01] no weapon. Say that will you. No weapon
[2:19:06] that is formed against me that shall
[2:19:09] prosper. Hallelujah.
[2:19:12] No weapon shall prosper. You'll prosper
[2:19:16] when Satan's making the weapon.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. I want to
[2:19:22] send you out of this place with victory
[2:19:25] in your soul. And not only a hope, but
[2:19:27] this is not a hope so religion. This is
[2:19:30] a I know it.
[2:19:34] Yes.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; When the redeemed
[2:19:44] joe
[2:19:45] [Music]
[2:19:59] and if you're not a believer, be a
[2:20:02] believer. Brother John talked about that
[2:20:04] that so touched my soul. Was it brother
[2:20:08] Brandham had a person in the healing
[2:20:09] line said if you're not saved just not
[2:20:13] right just step out and then step back
[2:20:16] in. I say to you you don't have to step
[2:20:19] anywhere. You just step on the side of
[2:20:22] repentance. I'm sorry oh God with the
[2:20:25] from the depths of my heart and I'm
[2:20:27] going to step back in. Glory to God. Is
[2:20:31] it just that simple? Just that simple.
[2:20:35] Do that. If you haven't got the victory,
[2:20:37] I'm going to just step out while I'm
[2:20:39] bound. Thank God I am free. Free. Free.
[2:20:43] I'll step back in. We'll shout and we'll
[2:20:46] sing when the redeemed are gathering in.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Next verse. There will be a
[2:20:55] [Music]
[2:21:00] I am
[2:21:04] beautiful.
[2:21:08] [Music]
[2:21:18] My
[2:21:21] [Music]
[2:21:22] soul
[2:21:28] is
[2:21:31] [Music]
[2:21:40] sing.
[2:21:46] [Music]
[2:21:52] angels
[2:21:56] join the song.
[2:21:59] [Music]
[2:22:05] [Music]
[2:22:20] You will be with me.
[2:22:22] [Music]
[2:22:27] Or you might say, I can just hear
[2:22:29] someone say, I'm well, I'm just not made
[2:22:31] quite like that. I'm not made like
[2:22:33] brother Bisco. Oh, give me another
[2:22:35] story.
[2:22:38] I I I just want to see you on the other
[2:22:40] side.
[2:22:41] I see the biggest crowd of fanatics I
[2:22:43] ever saw say, "Oh, Brother Biscll, you
[2:22:46] preached that when I was down there."
[2:22:48] That's exactly right.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; I preached that so that you could have
[2:22:52] this kind of liberty up here and down
[2:22:55] here. You believe it, friends?
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; I'm impressed when the prophet of God
[2:23:01] talked to people want to kill
[2:23:03] themselves. Said, "Now just go and be
[2:23:05] happy."
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why be happy? The
[2:23:08] deliverer's here.
[2:23:10] The healer is here.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Talk about the change of the body. The
[2:23:15] one that changes it is here.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; He sent his word here. We have it,
[2:23:20] friends. We have it all. Oh, when the
[2:23:24] redeemed
[2:23:28] river
[2:23:31] [Music]
[2:23:37] will
[2:23:40] sing when we
[2:23:44] are against
[2:23:49] how far away.
[2:23:53] Brother Murphy, you can come out.
[2:23:57] We better sing at a time or two. I'm
[2:24:00] waiting for those to be baptized.
[2:24:03] Oh, and the redeemer.
[2:24:06] [Applause]
[2:24:12] [Music]
[2:24:16] I will die.
[2:24:19] I will see.
[2:24:23] [Music]
[2:24:29] Shake hands with one another.
[2:24:32] Let's shake hands with one another.
[2:24:35] [Music]
[2:24:40] Heat. Heat.
[2:24:44] [Music]
[2:25:00] Heat. Heat.
[2:25:05] [Music]
[2:25:16] You may sit down. You may have your
[2:25:19] seats. Amen.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Sit down.
[2:26:16] Okay, good. So, brother Ryan Fong and uh
[2:26:20] has been faithfully coming to the
[2:26:21] service for almost two months. I think
[2:26:24] brother Ed was just appreciate
[2:26:28] everything you have to be perfect.
[2:26:30] Everything you have to be uh just right.
[2:26:32] But uh you know when I heard brother
[2:26:34] John told me um brother F is coming from
[2:26:38] North Vancouver and uh every time he
[2:26:40] come to the service he has to ride on
[2:26:42] bus for two two and a half hours almost
[2:26:45] and that's to take a great effort
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; if the that just shows that the people
[2:26:49] they're hungry for the word of God
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; and I'll say that in the last two months
[2:26:54] brother Ryan has heard a lot of your
[2:26:57] preaching.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And many times the hard saying
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; but the the seed of a god will never be
[2:27:02] turned away
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; but they always are receiving the word
[2:27:06] of a god.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; And so brother Ed just mentioned uh uh
[2:27:10] you know when uh Jesus when they uh come
[2:27:12] to uh uh speak into the word said if you
[2:27:14] don't eating my blood are you if you
[2:27:16] don't eat my flesh you don't drink my
[2:27:18] blood you have uh no life in you.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; And many people said this is hard saying
[2:27:23] and many people turned it away.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. But there are some people left
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; that is remant that Peter said uh uh you
[2:27:31] have the word of eternal life.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Who should we turn to?
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; And brother B said are they going to go
[2:27:37] back to the cold old denomination?
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; No, they cannot go back. Sometime the
[2:27:42] Lord is sit at the heart saying
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; he just we down the people.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; But as I was speaking the other day but
[2:27:48] the purpose is not only just to weigh
[2:27:50] down the people.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; The purpose is to get the group
[2:27:53] together. Amen.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Getting people ready for the rapture.
[2:27:57] Getting the people around the word. And
[2:27:59] that's exactly the word our brother Wine
[2:28:01] has doing.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; We are so thankful that uh he can give
[2:28:05] it his heart to the Lord
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; and to repented. And now we're going to
[2:28:09] the baptize him.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; And the brother John has shared the
[2:28:12] words uh with brother Ryan and in the
[2:28:16] last two months and also this morning.
[2:28:18] We just pray the Holy Spirit uh coming
[2:28:20] down to totally baptize our brother. We
[2:28:23] can baptize him in the water, but it
[2:28:25] take the Holy Spirit to come down to
[2:28:28] really embrace our brother into our Lord
[2:28:30] Jesus and booze him.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; You have anything to say?
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Uh Romans 3 has really been on my heart
[2:28:39] a lot. Uh Romans 3:23. So that's all I
[2:28:42] really have to say. A lot of stage pray.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; So let's have a prayer.

[2:32:07] in my aunt sister juniper
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; and also I saw the life that in the
[2:32:12] whole congregations over here she has
[2:32:14] been uh go to the church before that's
[2:32:17] in Beijing that's with sister juniper
[2:32:20] and uh uh I know that's the starting of
[2:32:23] it but it's the life of the people that
[2:32:25] really created the desire that I end our
[2:32:28] dear sister
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; and the bible said that for the name for
[2:32:31] the righteous that if they receive the
[2:32:33] righteous man, they will receive the
[2:32:35] gift, the reward of the righteous man.
[2:32:37] So we believe uh that our sister Kora
[2:32:40] has saw the life that in the people
[2:32:42] that's touched her and she said I said I
[2:32:45] want to live the same life like all you
[2:32:47] lived and so you have something you want
[2:32:51] to say to the Lord.
[2:32:54] Uh thanks Jesus Lord. Um leave me far
[2:32:58] away from to hear far far trying not to
[2:33:02] hear to receive his message to know his
[2:33:07] word to understand his word.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; And I think um from this moment from now
[2:33:14] on past is past I'm brand new.
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and I will walk he his way
[2:33:23] and he told me and he lead me and
[2:33:30] to know his word that's amen
[2:33:35] the Lord fill our sister

[2:39:43] Blessed be thy holy name, oh Lord.

[2:40:02] Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:08] Hallelujah.
[2:40:13] He said in that day you will know
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; I am in the father. The father in me. I
[2:40:18] in you and you in me.
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; What day? This day when the word becomes
[2:40:24] open.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; I wrote down something that brother
[2:40:26] Biscoll said right at the beginning. I
[2:40:29] want you to take it with you. Take
[2:40:31] everything with you. But I'm going to
[2:40:32] take your memory right back to the
[2:40:34] beginning of the sermon. Jesus
[2:40:38] the father
[2:40:40] and the words were synonymous.
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; And then he brings us into the picture.
[2:40:46] Jesus the father, the words that he
[2:40:50] spoke now become resident in a bride.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; All together God unveiling himself
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; now in bride form.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; You know, it's it's a great hour to live
[2:41:03] in in the opening of the word.
[2:41:06] what they had on the day of Pentecost
[2:41:08] now revealed by a message in these last
[2:41:12] day that you might understand the
[2:41:14] unveiling of God. That I might
[2:41:16] understand the unveiling of God. God had
[2:41:19] a purpose that he might reveal himself
[2:41:22] in his family.
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus the father, the word, and you.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; God's great purpose he had in his mind.
[2:41:33] What a wonderful day to live in.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; The most deceptive day,
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; but a day of overcomers,
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; a day of conquerors.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you rejoicing?
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads together as we
[2:41:47] dismiss in prayer.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; If you have a need, he's here very
[2:41:53] present. If you have a desire, a burden,
[2:41:58] or maybe you just want to say, "Lord,
[2:41:59] make these things real to me, more real
[2:42:03] than they've ever been before."
[2:42:06] Brother Brandham said in the in the
[2:42:07] message, the unveiling of God,
[2:42:10] it's not just what you say you believe,
[2:42:13] but when you really believe, you live
[2:42:14] it.
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; And it lives itself out through you.
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; So, let's just say, Lord, anchor this in
[2:42:21] our hearts this morning. Heavenly
[2:42:23] Father,
[2:42:25] how precious it's been, oh God,
[2:42:28] to sit at your feet, Lord,
[2:42:31] to hear these words and inspired through
[2:42:34] your servant the veil of a pastor.
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; The veil of a man, a gift, oh God, that
[2:42:41] you might step behind that veil. And
[2:42:43] that's what I was looking for. And I'm
[2:42:45] sure many were looking for this morning,
[2:42:47] Lord. That you might step behind the
[2:42:49] veil of a man and speak the word. The
[2:42:52] same word that was eternal, that existed
[2:42:55] before the world ever existed, now
[2:42:58] becoming known to the sons of God.
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, take those things and anchor them
[2:43:03] within our hearts. Wash us, purge us,
[2:43:06] Lord, with your word that we might stand
[2:43:10] totally in perfect faith before the
[2:43:13] throne of grace this morning and say,
[2:43:16] Lord, you are our father. You are our
[2:43:19] maker. You're the one that ordained our
[2:43:22] families to come the way they did. That
[2:43:25] we might come in this hour just exactly
[2:43:27] the way you wanted us. Yes. With the
[2:43:30] weaknesses that you knew that we would
[2:43:32] have that in our weakness, your strength
[2:43:35] might be made perfect.
[2:43:37] Lord, we thank you for your grace. We
[2:43:40] thank you for the power of your word. We
[2:43:43] thank you for the life of the blood of
[2:43:45] Jesus Christ that is in the body of
[2:43:48] Jesus Christ. And she has become the
[2:43:51] very blood of Jesus Christ by the life
[2:43:54] that is in her. And Lord, may you send
[2:43:57] us forth from this place with the word
[2:43:59] that we have heard this morning,
[2:44:01] anchored within our hearts. With a faith
[2:44:03] that resonates, greater is he that's in
[2:44:06] us than he that's in the world. And no
[2:44:08] matter what this world might raise up,
[2:44:10] the one that is in us will crest every
[2:44:13] wave.
[2:44:15] The stabilizers are on the ship. And no
[2:44:18] matter what storms lay ahead, we shall
[2:44:21] overcome by the one that has put his
[2:44:24] life in us. We thank you, Lord, for this
[2:44:27] time we could be in your house today.
[2:44:30] Lord, we might not be having a service
[2:44:32] here tonight. I know brother John will
[2:44:33] be traveling to minister and perhaps
[2:44:35] others as well to hear the word in
[2:44:37] Seattle. May you bless them, Lord. May
[2:44:40] you pour out your blessings in Seattle.
[2:44:42] Oh God, may you redeem every redeemable
[2:44:46] soul. Lord, may you be with Brother
[2:44:48] Kyle. The service will be just starting
[2:44:50] up there in Victoria now. Lord, may you
[2:44:53] bless his ministry. Lord, may you bless
[2:44:56] it to the benefit of your children over
[2:44:58] there. Pour in your life in your power,
[2:45:01] oh God. Lord, here we have no continuing
[2:45:04] city. We have one purpose, and that's to
[2:45:07] gather every predestinated seed to the
[2:45:10] redemptive plan of God. Go with us as we
[2:45:13] go our way. We love you, Lord. We love
[2:45:16] your word. We thank you for all you've
[2:45:18] done for us today in the wonderful name
[2:45:21] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. There's uh believers faith
[2:45:28] challenge updates that Brother Biscll
[2:45:29] spoke about this morning for every
[2:45:31] family. They're in the hallway by the
[2:45:34] office. You can pick one up there. I'm
[2:45:36] sure they'll be a blessing to you. The
[2:45:38] next service here will be Wednesday
[2:45:39] night at 7:30. Unless we're changed in a
[2:45:43] body change. That'll be even better.
[2:45:46] Praise the Lord. Shake hands with one
[2:45:47] another as you go. The service is
[2:45:49] dismissed in Jesus name.
