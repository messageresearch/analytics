TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I notice again now what's his three-fold purpose manifest himself in Jesus Christ to come into the body by Jesus Christ to have the premises to what restore back Eden bring back that which lost that's the only thing out of order all the rest of his things is in order but he had to let put man on free moral agency to fall so that he might be a savior to display what's in him see his attribute of Savior something had to be lost and the very thing that man fell and become lost he become the savior of that taken his own law and he could not do it is that great Jehovah that covered all SpaceTime see he could do it and he had to become a man and he took kinship with the man that was lost amen and become a man God made flesh Hallelujah think I'm excited but I'm not something inside God became from God to become me to take my sin upon him that he might make me him amen back to his great purpose of Sons and Daughters of God for he is a Eternal Father that attribute was in him
