AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.

the eagle puts his nest up there how different from his denominational brother the chicken the chicken builds his nest anywhere yet you can't say he's not a bird he is but he don't know nothing about the heavenlies he's never been up there he don't know nothing about it there's men and women who profess to be Christians who walk around in the scratching of the barnyards of some cold farmal indiff place and they don't know what it is to be lifted up into the spirit of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost would kill him he isn't built for it he can't take it he got to be borned Again by the holy spirit that changes his whole makeup and makes him a new creature in Christ Jesus you're changed from the creature that you are when you are born again of the spirit of God another thing the chicken is unconcerned about The Brood he builds his nest on the ground and the Rats the mice the weasels the snakes can get them that's what loose preaching does letting people go to the Rock and rolls and women wearing these immoral clothes Deacon smoken cigarettes it take them into the rats and the mice of hell that their souls and condemn them a preacher or a denomination or a church that would try to build a congregation on anything less than the solid rock of God's word you're wrong and your members will perish and you'll perish with them but the eagle is going to see different to that he goes so high that if a rat tried to climb it it break his neck
