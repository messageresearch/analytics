Time is near where everything that I hold dear will lay before the whole consuming fire. All my works and all my deeds and every prayer set on my knees will lay before the holy smoothing fire.

We should be the most thankful people on the face of the earth today. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask our brother Tim Mandis if you would come and open the service for us. We have one prayer request. We just pray for brother Jason Tagger for guidance for two jobs or wanting God's perfect will to be done. Trusting that unseen hand. Amen. If you have anything in your life that you need guidance for, if you need a touch from the Lord, we have a testimony from our sister Elena Hendrickson. For several weeks, she's been on medication for a severely pulled muscle in her back. She went in for prayer on Thursday night and felt it after that that taking the medication was no longer necessary and since then there's been absolutely no pain where before it had been almost constant. She wants to thank the Lord for her total healing. Amen. Praise God. Brother Tim wants to come up from the service for us. Okay. Brother Tim prays. Uh I just got a received an email from Switzerland and brother uh Jean Jacques uh who we who we prayed for the people from our church. Remember brother Jean Jocks and he and his wife Sister Marinette visit us. We just got an email from his daughter and he was up in service. He was uh uh reading some scripture and speaking speaking to the people and he just completely uh lost uh a lost mental ability of where he was and began to repeat himself again what he had just spoken a couple minutes before. And then two of the brothers came, his son and and brother Daniel Ken Bruner came and stood beside him and uh began to pray. And the people began to pray. They laid a prayer cloth of brother Brandham uh upon him and uh he didn't have any pain or anything but he just lost his mental faculties of where he was and then he couldn't remember anything. He couldn't remember yesterday. He couldn't remember that he had been so terribly sick about a year and a half ago. Couldn't remember any of those details. So they're going to be taking him to the hospital just to see what has taken place. but uh sent word to us so we could join with them in prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we've seen too many answers to prayer even this week, have we not? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, Brother Tim, as you're praying, remember brother Jean Jax. Let's &gt;&gt; all bow our heads. If you have a need, God knows. He knows your need. Just lift it up before him. Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, we come before you this morning, Lord. We're a needy people, Lord. each one of us, Lord. We need more of you, Lord. We need your you to come, Lord Jesus, into our lives. Change us, Lord. Take those things out, Lord Jesus. I believe this weekend, Lord, has just been a dying out to self, oh God. We've been losing the things of this world, oh God, and looking to you, Lord Jesus. Looking to you for the answers, Lord Jesus. Looking to you for companionship, Lord, to be our comfort, Lord Jesus. May you do that for each one, each life here today, Lord Jesus. Lord, we want to we want to go on, Lord Jesus. We want to see us all there, Lord Jesus. As brother Ron said, we're not going to we're not going to be satisfied with just half of us going, Lord. We want every life to be there, Lord Jesus. Oh God, take out the things of this world, Lord, that are trying to snuff us out. Oh God, take the drugs, Lord Jesus. Take the alcohol, oh God. Take those demons of the Satan that are holding us back, Lord Jesus. Take them under your subjection, oh God. every spirit here today, Lord. May you move, Lord Jesus, like you never had before, Lord. We've seen you do it in lives. You've transformed the lives, Lord. It may have seemed impossible, Lord, but nothing's impossible with you, Lord Jesus. We thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you for Brother Jason, Lord. He was delivered by cigarettes, Lord, from smoking, Lord, and now he has another need, Lord. Just meet that need, Lord. Meet that desire, oh God. Meet Brother John, wherever he is, Lord Jesus. whatever his mental condition is, oh God, you know, Lord Jesus, and you knew, Lord, that he would be in his condition, Lord. And for your glory, Lord, we ask that you would heal him, Lord, in your name if it be your will, Lord Jesus. Oh God, come, Lord, this morning, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're a needy people, God. We need you like never before in this age, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't want to ever come cold, Lord Jesus. Lord, just become a social gospel, Lord. We need you, Lord Jesus. And Lord, we're calling on you, oh God, the one that you know all things. You knew from the beginning to the end where we all are, Lord Jesus. And we're going through everything for a reason, oh God. May we never look at the circumstances, Lord. But Lord, we look to you. We lift our heads to you. For our strength cometh from you, Lord Jesus. So come behind the word, Lord. Reveal yourself. Prove yourself worthy, oh God. meet the desires of the people that lives would be changed and would be healed for your glory. Lord, thank you, Lord, for what you've done for Sister Elaine. Oh God, Lord, you can do it for each one of us, Lord. If we just confess it, believe it, Lord. You will do the work, Lord. We believe, Lord Jesus, and we receive it, and we accept it in your name. We're standing on thus sayeth the Lord, and your promises, and they shall never fail. Thank you, Jesus, for that calm assurance. we have just plus the remainder of the song service and the minister Lord may it be you Lord may we see you Lord Jesus you're speaking to us dealing with us and may we not become hard to that Lord may we be soft Lord Jesus clay in your hands that you can mold us make us and cut those things off that we don't have need of oh God that are holding us back from our victories in you Lord Jesus grant it Lord Jesus and may every life be changed in for your glory and your honor Lord in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Uh well, I've just prayed that the that the Holy Spirit will let a a cool breeze flow through here. &gt;&gt; And uh if you feel feel a little extra warm, well, just remember there's people in this world that are in a whole lot warmer conditions than we are. our brother Ron and Sister Connie Spencer and uh sister Whitney and her friend I guess they've come from where it's 100 plus. Brother Eddie Hurley, God bless him for coming from Kentucky and it's a 100 plus down there and humidity. &gt;&gt; Let's say praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's the right one to praise. &gt;&gt; It could be a lot warmer. So we're thankful for that. I want to just give some recognition before the service continues uh to everyone who has uh put such an effort forward for these meetings and for the camp and I trust I will not miss anyone but we have to kind of generalize everyone as far as I'm concerned has put forward a 110% if not more uh in this camp everyone and uh brother brother Ron I'm including the wives in these cases brother Ron his wife Sister Connie brother Ron I'm sure that everyone who even streamed the service last night and we've heard from those that have been streaming the meetings and they are so so blessed uh and we are blessed are we not &gt;&gt; brother Ron put out a th000% last night I mean he hardly knew where he was when he was done ministering and you know that's what the anointing does to a person uh is just it's such a force and it's a heavenly force. It's a divine force. It's the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and and a person just yields themselves. Brother Ron, we are so thankful. Uh and he will soon be coming. Uh brother Tom and Sister Joanne Ray in preparing for the camp. Brother John and Sister Sharon Andes and Sister uh Sarah Ashdown. I can tell you that these people have worked for weeks and weeks in arranging where you're going to sleep, where you're going to stay. And the camp was 100% maxed out. One brother came in unexpectedly and he needed a bed to sleep in. And uh we had we had a few people get a little sick for 24 hours and I think it was brother Ricardo, he wasn't feeling that well. He was laying on the lawn over here and he went home. So, we gave this brother his bed. It was the only bed there was. So, the camp was just 100% maxed out. We're thankful for those that have labored so much. Uh, Brother Derek and Sister Debbie Paris and their family, even their even their eldest daughter works. And I want to thank brother Derek and sister Debbie. You can hold your applause until we're done. Uh, and they and they have a staff here at the camp. You don't hardly maybe recognize what they're doing. Brother Paul Holford out here watering just uh the roadway so we you have less dust. I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; Brother Matt Beanis and Sister Angela Brooks answering the phone. I was I was in there doing some work and I could hardly keep my concentration. The phones are ringing. The radio's from someplace calling. Where's Brother Derek and where's this person? Where's that person? uh and sister Karen and brother Gil Ashdown. Sister Karen has put an incredible amount of labor into making the uh arranging for the food. But brother Raymond and Sister Raisesa Young, Brother Raymond has actually I think he's taken charge of ordering the food and so that we would have Hasn't the meals been wonderful? Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't doesn't even feel like a camp from the meals. Who ever saw cinnamon buns the size you did this morning? I said, "Cut that thing in half and I could barely eat half." How many ate a whole one? Oh my goodness. Almost all boys. The entire kitchen staff. The entire kitchen staff, sisters. They've been working 12 and 15 hours a day. I say God bless the kitchen staff and all of you that labored for them. Amen. God bless them. And the other support staff at the that's worked around the camp. I don't even know them all, but they've cleaned rooms and they've tidied up things and sometimes had to do things and uh that weren't all that pleasant. Some got sick in the rooms and they they don't just clean it up. I mean they completely uh sterilize the place. So when the next person comes in, God bless them. Brother Tom Frey and Sister Kim, they have worked tirelessly. Brother Tom arranged that the that this tent is up and uh you're fanning yourself now and it's warm in here. But let me tell you, you'd appreciate it if it was raining. &gt;&gt; At least most of you are except where the holes are and some rain might come through. So, God bless Brother Tom. When you're done and you walk away from here, his work's just starting again. And I saw him up there getting trailers. We appreciate Brother Tom and Sister Kim that have uh that have really labored. Um, Brother Ryan, who's led song service, and his wife, Sister Yolena. You know, the reason why we include the women is when the men are away and when they're doing something or the women are busy doing something, the husbands have to be there or the women and the wives have to be there. So, we appreciate, brother Ryan, the time you've spent and uh and preparing prayerfully for these services, the sound and the video staff. And I can tell you brothers that the people that are streaming even right now in Sunday evening in Switzerland and in Europe and different parts of the world, they appreciate that. And I God bless you each one. Brother Darren, brother Aaron, all of you, brother Isaac, and uh my brother Nathaniel, brother uh Jules, we appreciate that. Brother Michael and Abigail Ray, they worked uh at arranging the things and the activities in the daytime. And brother Marco and and sister Sharon Vanenter. Uh and there's many that were missing. I'm I know because there's been so many that have worked. Uh uh uh sister the counselors, God bless the counselors. I thought that all all you young people would say, "Amen." And God bless our counselors. God bless you counselors and the time that you spent in the hours after a service. And and uh last but certainly not least, all of you that have attended, if you hadn't come, there wouldn't be a camp. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to turn around, shake hands with somebody &gt;&gt; and say, "Thank you for being here. God bless you." Some of you don't look very happy while you're shaking hands. I I hope you're all happy that everyone come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did we leave anybody out? I don't think so. Those you that traveled and come from so far, some from Montana, some from Idaho, some from Phoenix, some from Chicago, uh our brother Miracle and his wife, God bless you. and they have to leave right after the service. And uh uh how many would like to see uh another time next year? &gt;&gt; The only thing that's better than this is the rapture. &gt;&gt; And we're all in agreement about that. &gt;&gt; And if we don't meet here in the dining room, we'll meet at another dining table. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many have a reser reservation there? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you, brother Ryan. Sing us happy. God bless you. What we do is get all the preliminaries out of the way. If we could have the deacons come forward, then we'll just Brother Ryan will lead us in a song and we'll uh take up the offerings and the tithes. Also, let's remember our sister Barb Drake and uh her daddy passed away yesterday morning. I know that most of you know it, but uh the Bible says that we we uh rejoice with those that rejoice and we sorrow with those that sorrow. And even though you can be as prepared as you wish to be prepared when that finally final moment of departure comes, there is a sting with death. &gt;&gt; And you can't avoid the sting. But the the apostle Paul says we don't sorrow as others who have no hope. Hallelujah. I'm so glad we have a hope beyond this grave. And so let's remember our sister Barb uh and and and the family, the brother John Gray, and he's traveling with his whole family. Uh also the other sisters are down there. There's three other sisters that I know of and they're down there with them now at this time. So I wonder if the deacons could come forward, please, and we'll just uh have a word of prayer and you give of your offering and tithes, please. We'll appreciate that. And if you're not prepared with your tithes now, you can give it at the church when you get back. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful. We don't know how to thank you. We haven't got the words. We don't have enough time today, but we will spend the rest of our life thanking you and praising you and giving glory to the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you for all of our beloved friends and members of the body of Jesus Christ. We pray that you'll bless them wherever they're meeting today around the earth and those ministers that minister and the gifts that are being given now, Lord, and the tithes that are being given in support of the ministry and in support of these kind of meetings. I pray, Father, that you will bless the giving of the people and multiply it to meet every need. Lord, you always have and we know that you will continue to do so. We give you praise. Bless the deacons, Lord, who have served so faithfully. They have not mentioned them, but they've been here every night. I pray that you'll bless them in their office. Oh God, bless their wives and their families and in their homes. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. And we thank you for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We don't want to miss this opportunity. &gt;&gt; Amen. If anyone needs it, there also is a tithe and offering box set up out next to the pond if you're not prepared at this moment but wanted to give this morning. Our sister Hedi Kasani is going to come and bless us with a special. Why don't we sing blessed be the Lord God Almighty as she comes. We'll start with the verse father in heaven.

Just as we prepare to turn to the word now, we didn't get a chance to have a choir song this camp. We had a busy schedule and didn't allow for it. But there's a song the choir knows. It's called Towards the M Mark. I want to give my life as a living sacrifice. If I do, it's uh I had the number written down. Number 1049. So, if you're a young person, what's wrong with your young person would like to come up and sing, please do. If you don't remember it very well, that's okay. You'll learn it after a time or two. So, why don't we have those who would like to come and sing it. I want to give my life as a testimony and a confession after this camp. We're not just coming up to sing. Those who want to make a declaration. I want to give my life as a living sacrifice. We're just going to sing the chorus, come on up. We've got room. And those of you who don't come up can sing it from the audience. I believe we're going to get some microphones set up here. Amen. Wonderful.

Have you enjoyed the meeting? &gt;&gt; Just to be here on these grounds is just just supernatural. And we just we certainly for my part I've I've thoroughly enjoyed this meeting probably above many others. And so we're just so thrilled. And wherever he is that's where we want to be at. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd rather be where he is five minutes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Than to be where he was all my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'd like to thank brother Ed for inviting me and putting up with me and and brother Tom and brother John and all the other helpers here. You've treated you've treated me like royalty. My wife, my family, uh sister Whitney with us and Sister Autumn as well. We'd like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts and like to thank thank you for just just in just coming and pulling on the word and and I pray that you've you've been touched by the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My mother and father, brother Charlie and sister Christine would like to pass on their hells. and my father-in-law and mother-in-law, Brother Homer and Sister Nancy, and our church. And well, I could spend the rest of the day saying hello. But way yonder in the Shannondoa Valley, there's an outpost down there. &gt;&gt; We're not fighting the Civil War no more. &gt;&gt; But we're fighting this Leotan battle. &gt;&gt; And uh remember us in prayer. We've got a meeting that's just in a couple of weeks as well. And remember that meeting that God would just be with us there. We've got a couple people with cancer. Sister Natalie Jce that has cancer and the doctors has said she has somewhere between a 5% and 20% chance of survival. But we have a high priest. &gt;&gt; My own brother-in-law, brother Harold Shifflet has cancer and third stage. And we ask the Lord that you would just you remember him when you're talking to the Lord. and &gt;&gt; Sister Stephanie that's been in the hospital for almost 3 months now and carrying twins and total bed rest. We ask you that you'd pray for them. &gt;&gt; Pray that God gives us all strength to to to to make it and and uh gives us strength to survive even this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just ask you that you'd min you'd just pray for us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. pray for my vocal cords. And after all, we just need to thank the Lord that we're able to preach. Period. &gt;&gt; When the doctor said we'd never be able to do it again, here we are. &gt;&gt; If you never see another miracle, you've seen one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And if you will turn with me to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, I would like to speak this morning on pressing the mark. &gt;&gt; I want to read to you a poem that was very very quoted very much by brother Brandham and then the Lord gives him a poem as well just before just before we go to the word. Brother Brandham quotes this over and over and over again. Must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of bees while others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody seas? &gt;&gt; No, I must fight if I must reign. Increase my courage, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help me &gt;&gt; and support me by thy everlasting word. This was given to brother Brandham in prophecy, tongues and and then prophecy. Because thou hast chosen the narrow path, the harder way that hast walked of thine own choosing, thou hast picked the correct and precise decision, and it is my way. And because of this momentous decision, a huge portion of heaven awaits thee. What a glorious decision thou has made. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a glorious decision thou has made. This in itself is that which will give and make to come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine. &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians chapter 4 and I'll start at verse 15. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, with a trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Paul writing this almost 2,000 years ago by the breath of God, by the anointing of God, writing about me and you. &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And that's what believers believe. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. Chapter 5 verse one. But of the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that that you have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. And when they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of day. We're not of the night, nor of the darkness. Therefore, let us not sleep as do others. But let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep in the night, and they that are drunken are drunken in the night. But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and of love, and for a helmet and a hope of salvation. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; we thank you now as we have just now come to the last last service of this meeting. We're very much aware that father that we this could be the last time ever lord in this type of a setting. Our next meeting may be with you. We believe we're just at that time. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I ask you that you would anoint these lips of clay one more time. Lord, you see the weariness of my own flesh and the the tiredness of my own vocal cords. But Lord, this message is a passion to me. &gt;&gt; It's more than houses, homes, businesses, &gt;&gt; all the money in the world. &gt;&gt; All the popularity that man could give. Lord, I ask you that you would just come and by divine energy, give us strength this morning. &gt;&gt; Both as hearers and as speaker, &gt;&gt; Lord, drive back every enemy from away from us. &gt;&gt; We're aware that thousands of angels have gathered to watch your children worship. &gt;&gt; And Lord, may you energize us this morning like never before. No doubt as we've give all of our energies in this camp and we've enjoyed our time of play and our time of worship. But Lord, may you come personally to us today. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I pray that you would ignite us like never before. &gt;&gt; Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray, touch our hearts, meet every need in your name. May we be a witness, a torch, Lord, &gt;&gt; in this day in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated this afternoon. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, there's just sometimes you just feel like just busting. This is one of those times for me. Brother Brandham makes a quotation that I want to just share with you this morning. Taking sides with Jesus. And I want to draw some thoughts from here this morning. What if God would have told John the Revelator? Now, it's going to be 2,000 years before my coming. John would have come back and told the church. Well, I guess we may as well eat, drink, be merry, cuz there's going to be many generations. Jesus ain't coming for 2,000 years. See, the church would have been loose. &gt;&gt; There would have been no on the mark. There have been no waiting. After all, it's your anticipations. &gt;&gt; If you fall asleep in that watch &gt;&gt; that you wake with them the same anticipations &gt;&gt; cuz it ain't going to hinder &gt;&gt; one thing. You're going to be right there on time anyhow. &gt;&gt; See? See what I mean? Notice the statement. When St. Martin awaits in the resurrection, St. Paul and the rest of them, can I add just a moment, brother Pam? &gt;&gt; It'll be just as fresh as if they went right in the battle, battling right away &gt;&gt; cuz they went right down under those same anticipations looking for his coming. &gt;&gt; And there will be a scream come. Oh, hallelujah. And up will come the whole church. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter 1. &gt;&gt; And I was in the spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice as a as of a trumpet, saying, I'm Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. What thou seeest write in a book and send it in the seven churches which are in Asia and Ephesians and right on down. In verse 17, and when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not. I am the first and the last. &gt;&gt; I am he. I am he. Hallelujah. That was dead. And behold, I am alive forever more. Amen. And have the keys of hell and of death. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter. The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in the right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. And in this day, we don't have to guess who they were. God has took the guesswork out of it. &gt;&gt; We're not having to write a book about theories. &gt;&gt; We're not standing guessing. Well, maybe we'll compare this ministry with this ministry and this ministry with this ministry. But we know that first star was Paul. &gt;&gt; We know that he ran the race &gt;&gt; with everything that was within him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He could write the book of Ephesians with guards standing around him and chains on him, hooked to a soldier, but that didn't deter his energy. It did not deter his his vision. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he wrote the letters, Brother Tim, and he would hand them out knowing there were men that were going to be ignited by the word. &gt;&gt; And they would carry this with all of their heart. this weekend study. I just I just I just had a special time. I can just see Paul as he begins to come &gt;&gt; sees how everything is laying and God allows him now to write about the rapture of the church. as he begins to he begins to take the whatever type of material he's going to use for paper and whatever pen they would use. He begin to write it down. This is now God's covenant &gt;&gt; with his wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; And no matter how dark your battle gets, &gt;&gt; no matter how hard your way gets, &gt;&gt; I'm making you a covenant. &gt;&gt; I'm making you a covenant. &gt;&gt; If you have to go in the grave, &gt;&gt; go there with every bit of energy. &gt;&gt; Don't give up. &gt;&gt; There's no time to lighten up. There's no time to quit. &gt;&gt; Go to your grave with every bit of energy. &gt;&gt; Give it all s &gt;&gt; cuz he goes back to the scripture where Jesus turned to his disciples, let not your heart be troubled. &gt;&gt; You believe in God, believe also in me. &gt;&gt; In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you that where I am, there you are. &gt;&gt; There you &gt;&gt; as as the bride &gt;&gt; when brother Brandham came to the pullpit, this was not for denomination. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you about your future home. &gt;&gt; I want to talk to you about your future home. It wasn't going to be a 30inut message. &gt;&gt; 4 hours he would begin to spend with with the wife of heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He slipped the wedding band of unmarited grace on you before the foundation of the world. He reminded you that you were elected in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; You were predestinated. God bypassed a million and chose you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, there may be some wars. Yes, there may be some terrible things, but God thought of you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Talks about the behavior of the people in the motel. the behavior of the people in the in in the community, the behavior in the restaurants. I'd like to thank you for your behavior, he says. Why would he do that? Because he's he is preaching to a people that that can be citizens of the kingdom of God living right here &gt;&gt; in total darkness. when he even couldn't see past 1977, &gt;&gt; when it was so dark and so wicked and so religious, &gt;&gt; God would have beacons of light in the midst of darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For when Paul was pinning it out, we &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz he had an expectation. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't get to see him, but he wanted to see him. &gt;&gt; The ministers under Paul who had been ignited, pastors, teachers, evangelists, men of God that had got a hold of it &gt;&gt; and preached it with, listen, they may not had the same ministry that Paul had because we're not to compare oursel with one another. All of us has got different ministries. &gt;&gt; But listen, whatever ministry that you have &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you're a minister to your little little children and home sisters, &gt;&gt; give it every bit of energy you got. &gt;&gt; You're the janitor to the church, clean every part. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No matter where you're at in the darkest of night, whether you're in a church with 10 people or 5,000 people, listen, give it every bit of energy that you've got. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We and I can just think of all of the hundreds of thousands of men that walked to the pullpit took this text believing with all of their heart. &gt;&gt; We're that group. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God could not give them the revelation it's going to be 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; It's it cannot tarry. They cannot have the revelation it's going to be because you must give everything. God wants your whole might. He wants your whole heart. He wants your whole soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus was standing there. I want you to notice a statement that he uses. Sometimes I use the word I'm discombobulated, but here we are. Paul would write this words. And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience, among whom we had our conversations in times past, in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of our flesh and the mind. were by nature the children of wrath even as others. But God who is rich in mercy &gt;&gt; for his great love wherewin with he loved us even when we were dead in trespass dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved notice this next statement and hath raised us up &gt;&gt; and made us to sit together in heavenly places. And brother I said that's our position in Christ Jesus. We are his workmanship &gt;&gt; created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. &gt;&gt; He comes to Ephesians 6 and he said finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, and against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that's your covenant. &gt;&gt; He said that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand, stand. Stand therefore, having your your loins gird about with truth, having on the breastplate of righteousness, your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace. He says, above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and the helmet of salvation, with the sword of the spirit and the word of God, praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, watching there unto all perseverance and supplication for all saints. Watch what brother says. He says, "And when God was going to equip his children, &gt;&gt; he said he gave them the best weapon that they could have," &gt;&gt; that was his word. &gt;&gt; We said it the other night. His word will defeat Satan anywhere, &gt;&gt; any place, &gt;&gt; anytime. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'd like to hear one of those old guys testify. Let's just hear him for just a few minutes. Peter. Peter's going to preach. &gt;&gt; And listen, he's going to preach with passion. &gt;&gt; He's going to preach with inspiration. &gt;&gt; He's seen the word open up to him. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. But Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them, "Ye men of Judea and all that dwell in Jerusalem, be it known unto you, and hearken unto my words, for these are not drunken as ye suppose, seeing, it is but the third hour of the day, but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel." He literally takes this word and it becomes a human vessel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It becomes humanity now. &gt;&gt; This is that. &gt;&gt; It was a prophecy, but now it's history. &gt;&gt; They preached about a bride coming, but it's history now. We're here. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, we're looking for that last revival. We're here. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel. And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out my spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your young men shall see visions. Your old men shall dream dreams. My and my sermons, oh my handmaidaidens, I will pour out in in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy, and I will show wonders in the heaven above, signs in the earth beneath, blood, fire, vapor of smoke, and the sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon into blood before that great and durable day of the Lord to come. And it shall come to pass. Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Let me just say, I'm sure Peter wasn't standing like some some dead preacher standing there whispering. &gt;&gt; It was with every bit of energy that was within him. &gt;&gt; He could care less if they were saying, "Isn't that that the guy that denied the Lord? Isn't that the guy that was cussing the other day? Isn't that the guy that became a coward?" &gt;&gt; He was saying, "This is that. I heard a Jubilee sound. &gt;&gt; All the words that was in the book, I couldn't understand. It's open to me now. &gt;&gt; He's my redeemer. He's &gt;&gt; more than just our redeemer. He's our king. He's our husband. &gt;&gt; He's our bridegroom. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You men of Israel, hear these words. This is fresh. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you. as yourselves also know him being delivered by determinate counsel and the knowledge of God ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should beholden of it for David speaking concerning him I forsaw the Lord always before my face and he is before on my right hand that I should not be moved. Therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad. Moreover, also my flesh and my it shall rest in hope because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell. Neither will thou suffer that holy one to seek corruption. &gt;&gt; There rumors somebody stole the body did not deter Peter. &gt;&gt; I have seen him. &gt;&gt; I have seen him. &gt;&gt; I have a vindication. He lives in my heart. &gt;&gt; He was with me. &gt;&gt; He was here. I seen the miracles. &gt;&gt; But the God that lived in him lives in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thou has made known to me the ways of life. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt make me full of joy with my countenance. Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you &gt;&gt; of the patriarch David, &gt;&gt; that he is both dead and buried, and his supplicers with us into this day. Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God has sworn an oath to him that are the fruit of his loins according to his flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he seeing this before he spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus, &gt;&gt; this is not a whatif gospel here. &gt;&gt; This Jesus, &gt;&gt; this Jesus, &gt;&gt; this isn't a theory or an ideology. &gt;&gt; This Jesus &gt;&gt; have God raised up. There are we are all witnesses. &gt;&gt; Who's so we all? Brother Bam said even Mary &gt;&gt; even Mary who carried him nine months who was visited by the angel Gabriel and he stood in a small narrow passageway a man about six foot tall shoulder length hair down had a robe on and sandals on and he called her by name. and identified who she was and identified what God's plans was for her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She watched the zodiac come into order. She watched the star. She saw the shepherds. She Sheard the angels sing the first Noel. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know it's hot, but boy, this is good. She watched God supernaturally protect that baby. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She She watched him. &gt;&gt; Listen, she even left him alone to go and she left him like the church does at 12 years old. And she comes back and here's the brightest minds in the entire world sitting around and talking philosophy and astronomy and science. Right. &gt;&gt; Men that could blow the minds &gt;&gt; of just their deep thinking and they're astounded. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I'd like to spend a little time right there. They're astounded of what he knows about the nervous system and the artery system, how the complexes of life works. &gt;&gt; They're astounded about how the stars are laid out, how each star has to circle another star and the orbits have to be a certain way, how they're a certain degree, and the 24th and and all of this. And he begins to lay that out for him, why this this would mean this and this would would mean that. And the astronomers, the greatest men, sitting there going, And it's not only science, &gt;&gt; it's not only physicians, &gt;&gt; but he takes the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because he's that one that has been prophesied of. This Jesus whom you did crucify, &gt;&gt; this one that stood among you, &gt;&gt; Mary watched it. She watched miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle. &gt;&gt; And yet he wouldn't even call her mother. &gt;&gt; He would rebuke her when she would make an error in her testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, that didn't give her the new birth. &gt;&gt; Listen, in all of that, that didn't make her the new birth. It was a Catholic system that made her a god. &gt;&gt; But even in her mortal condition, she still needed to be born again. &gt;&gt; She still needed a jubilee sounding for herself. &gt;&gt; She still needed the life of God. I want you to just watch a qu questions and answers. Brother Ram details it. Apologize for its length. No, I don't. &gt;&gt; But the man says, "For the worshipper once purged has no more conscience of sins. &gt;&gt; He has passed from death into life, and he's got eternal life inside of him dwelling there, and can no more die than God can die." If you ever get a revelation of that right there, &gt;&gt; if you ever get a revelation that you are as eternal as God is eternal, &gt;&gt; they can burn this body. &gt;&gt; It can be whatever accident there is. There's an anchor that holds on to you. &gt;&gt; There's an anchor that holds on to you. &gt;&gt; He says, now watch this. He said, "And he's got eternal life and dwelling inside of him. He can no more die than God." Exactly. The Bible, he's eternally taken care of because he's got eternal life. He said, "That don't mean that you can sin and get by with it with your sin, you're punished for your sins. But as long as eternal life is in there, you live forever." Jesus said, "He that hearth my word and he that hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall never come into judgment, but has passed from death unto life." No man can come except my father draw him first and all that comes I will at that day he says all that my father father's given will come to me and all that has given will come and none of them will be lost and I'll give him them life eternal and will raise him up at the last day &gt;&gt; oh what a blessed assurance he says they then you don't have to be scared about death and wondering he said God has given us a perfect assurance that we are his children &gt;&gt; and as his children he corrects us just like I correct my children and you correct your children. When they're wrong, we correct them. If my children does wrong, then it's my duty as a father to correct them. If God's children does wrong, it's his duty as a father to correct you. Just remember, you will be corrected. But as long as you're his child, &gt;&gt; as long as you're his child, &gt;&gt; the world better keep their hands off of you. It's far better for you that a millstone was hanging around your neck and drowned in the depths of the sea than to bring one offense against one of the little ones. Brother Pat, back to your question. I like how he kind of gets off and then comes back. Brother Pat, back to your question. The spirits that went out of a man drove him like a maniac. Does the same thing in people today. It's them spirits. Thousands times thousands. The devil comes in just like a little opium. And he said they take a little school girl and the first thing they do is they get her to smoke a cigarette. That gets her started. The next thing they do, they'll they'll get a little stronger and then the first thing it ends up in is marijuana. Here's brother Brandham explaining the drug world. &gt;&gt; Here he's explaining the drug world. He starts you out with just a little thing. And you say, "Well, it won't hurt me, Brother Ron. I can do this and get by with it. It has no end to it." &gt;&gt; He says, "And the next thing to do, get a little strong and the first thing it ends up in marijuana." And then from that to a a real dope addict, what does it do? It drives them insane. They'll go crazy. The devil's got a hold of them. So the devil is in smoking cigarettes and that little old in a little mile for them. And if he sees you're pretty smart and goes to catching on, he'll never take you any further than just cigarettes. And as long as he can hold you there long enough, he can get your life snapped out. &gt;&gt; Cuz he knows that you can't go until God said so. But you'll hear a sermon after sermon, message after message, punch after punch on it, warning after warning. If he can keep you warted off and keep your mind on something else and as being a popular person or you've just got to have it, something like that, then he can hold on to you until he gets the gets you out. &gt;&gt; Watch the statement. Or if he can get you to join a church, &gt;&gt; he can get you to join a church &gt;&gt; or come to a he says he says, "Oh, I'm going to be a good fellow. I'm going to turn a new page." He says, "I'm going up to the church and join the church." &gt;&gt; If he could just keep you under that, that's all he has to do. He said he's got to get you. Because Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born of water and of spirit, he will in no wise enter the kingdom." &gt;&gt; It's very important here. &gt;&gt; He comes down. He talks about a farmer talking about putting corn in the ground, being perfect corn. He says, "Unless it has a germ of life in it, it'll just lay there and rot. It'll never raise up again." He says, "I don't mean to hurt your feelings. This is my church. This is my tabernacle. I'm free as a bird." I want you to remember that in this that a man can be good. He can pay his tithes. He can be honest. He can help the widows. He can help the orphans. He can be a church member. And you can't find one flaw about that man. Every time there's something to come up right down in his pocket, he'll get every last penny that he's got to give it to the poor. He'll stand with you through thick and thin. He'll be your buddy even when a lot of so so-called others turn out and will will turn you down and everything like that. Notice that statement. Every one of us as pastors want that kind of guy in our church. &gt;&gt; But notice that's not the important part &gt;&gt; in all of that. He said that man is still outside of the kingdom of God unless he's been filled with the Holy Ghost. Unless he's been dramatized by the life of God. &gt;&gt; That's how important it is. &gt;&gt; I just want to spend a moment right here. Let me just say this to you, especially each and every one of you young people. If I can have your attention. I know it's hot. Satan will offer you everything that he can offer you to deter you. &gt;&gt; Everything possible. Not just you guys, but you guys. &gt;&gt; He'll offer you jobs that'll take you away from church. &gt;&gt; He'll offer you education. And brother Baron said, he says, "Education only," and we all got to have it, but education will only take you further away from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've got a daughter-in-law. She has not just one, but she actually has two. She She wouldn't let you know that for all the money in the world, but I'm going to tell it on her. She has two master's degree and two complete different subjects. One day we we were we were together as a family and I looked at her and I just read what brother Brandham said about that. I said, "Sister Cassie, I have to ask you a question. Brother Brandham makes a statement that education will only take you further from God. You came through your schooling. I want to ask you, what do you make of that statement? And she paused a moment. And she said,"I tell you now, had I not had the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; had I not had the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; with all of their power of reasoning, &gt;&gt; they would have made me question the word. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost kept me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost kept me. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's how important it is. &gt;&gt; Because you can't have even a token without having the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You cannot make the rapture without having the Holy Ghost. You can't live an overcoming life without having the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, but I prayed and I prayed and I prayed." You keep You keep praying as hard as you can. You stay urgent. You stay desperate before God. &gt;&gt; How will I know? You'll know. &gt;&gt; You'll know. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to compare evidence with evidence tonight. Listen, you probably won't get the experience I did or brother Tom did or brother John did or brother Ed did. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But God will be individual to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the kind of God that your experience is different than another's experience. &gt;&gt; And it'll be a love affair between you and him. And you'll know &gt;&gt; when you feel like quitting, he's in there. &gt;&gt; When you don't feel like praising the Lord, he's in there. &gt;&gt; When you don't feel like making it another day, he's in there. &gt;&gt; It's like a little stream. Why do you bubble? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you bubble? Because the deer come and drink from you. The animals come and I come and drink from you. Oh no, it's an artillerian well. It's bubbling from the inside out. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I can't get rid of these habits. Just keep giving them to God. &gt;&gt; Just keep giving them to God. Just keep giving them to God. &gt;&gt; Listen, I can't say enough. Just keep giving them to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz you know who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just feel led to stay here just a second. You know, in the privacy of your own home, &gt;&gt; you know, when you're all by yourself, man, woman, boy, or girl, you know what you're dealing with. But you take that weakness to God. &gt;&gt; You take that weakness to God. &gt;&gt; You keep Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Cuz he leaves some things for you to overcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; Having a good time. &gt;&gt; I think in the world they call it time out. You're about to kill me. Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to pick it up. Freely speak unto you of the patriarch David. He's both dead, buried. Seplic is with us in today, this day. I'm sure there was a people still worshiping David. And he's seeing this before he spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh that did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up. Wherefore we're all witnesses, therefore being by the right hand of God, exalted, having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he shall shed forth his this which now see and hear. For David is not ascended into the heavens, but he sth, the Lord sth unto my Lord, sit on my right hand until I make thy enemies thy foottool. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A lot of time could be spent right there. And when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart &gt;&gt; and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, &gt;&gt; men and brethren, what shall we do? &gt;&gt; And he stood there and he said, "Get your tape recorder &gt;&gt; and listen to all the tapes. Sir, &gt;&gt; believe God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; No, them things are fine. &gt;&gt; Repent &gt;&gt; every one of you. &gt;&gt; Repent every one of you and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; for the remission of your sins &gt;&gt; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother B said that is the inoculation to sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said he said if doctors were given shots that would give you life eternal there'd be lines forever. You couldn't get near the building. &gt;&gt; He said God gave you an inoculation to sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave you an inoculation. Some of you'd like to have inoculation from the flu this week. &gt;&gt; But he gave you an inoculation. I'm the Lord that health thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll give you the Holy Ghost. For the promise, this covenant is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. What is a covenant, brother Ron? Let me just spend a couple of minutes right here. God said to Abram, "I'll be your shield. I'll be your buckler." And Abram began to watch God. He watched God how he wa moved him. He moved him from one place to another. And he kept his focus on God. And God changed his name. Because in Abram and Sarah as a dominating female, he could not produce the promise. &gt;&gt; So God made a covenant with him and he took part of his own attributes and he puted on the inside of him &gt;&gt; and changed his name from Abram to Abraham, &gt;&gt; Sarah to Sarah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A princess with God. Because in their own energies, all they did was he produced Ishmamail, which we're still dealing with. &gt;&gt; And in our own energies, we'll only produce churchgoers. &gt;&gt; We'll only produce another denomination. But if he can come and transform our lives, &gt;&gt; it'll be kind after kind after kind after kind after kind. Cuz every seed will reproduce itself. It will not be denomination. How can we protect this which we've got? How can we take care of it? &gt;&gt; This life will reproduce itself. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's God's life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When God wants to reproduce horses, he produces horses. Horses. Horses. And then elephants. Elephants. Elephant. Elephants. When God wants to reproduce himself, it's miniature gods on the earth. Now, not only did God I want to just not only did God hide some things, but the devil did, too. Because the devil laughed when Abram laughed. He just kept getting older and he criticized him. He mocked him. He made fun of him. He whispered in his ears. No doubt the devil was just feet away from Melzdc as he sat there as God which God had blowed a body and stepped into two messengers go to Sodom and only feet away Satan was watching. &gt;&gt; He no doubt hears the words, "Where's your wife Sarah?" &gt;&gt; She laughed in her heart. And he's thinking, "Good, this will kill her. &gt;&gt; This will kill her." All of these years, &gt;&gt; all of these years, &gt;&gt; this will get her. And because she was part of Abraham and a part of the promise, &gt;&gt; God refused to kill her. &gt;&gt; Cuz she was the predestinated womb through which the seed had to come through. Listen, God knew he had to come through Rahab. &gt;&gt; He knew he had to come through Tamar. &gt;&gt; God dropped that in brother Ed's heart here a few years ago to preach on the five ladies of grace. Listen, God was just revealing. &gt;&gt; He was revealing to this bride, "Grace, &gt;&gt; I've watched over you. I protected your womb. &gt;&gt; He knew he had to come through, &gt;&gt; Ruth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It did not deter the plan of God that Rahab was a harlot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Cuz out of her womb would come Boaz. &gt;&gt; And he had to have the complexes of life. Because there was a Ruth headed his way &gt;&gt; and he had to redeem Naomi to get Ruth. &gt;&gt; Our Lord had to forgive the Jews to get me and you. &gt;&gt; Father, forgive them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgive them. &gt;&gt; Why was he forgiving them to get me? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It was cruel. It was horrible. But he had to forgive him. &gt;&gt; Abraham testified. He testified. He testified of the covenant. He testified of the covenant. He testified of the covenant. And one morning he woke up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He looked over standing combing her hair. &gt;&gt; I read it this morning. Brother Beam said her hair was so black and shiny. &gt;&gt; Her eyes were velvety looking. said she was the most beautiful. &gt;&gt; She was the most beautiful woman in the whole world. &gt;&gt; Abraham's heard that. Satan's heard that testimony all this time. &gt;&gt; Now look, &gt;&gt; he's got laboratories all over this world &gt;&gt; trying to give herbs. vitamins, &gt;&gt; every kind of exercise machine there is. &gt;&gt; Faceelifts, &gt;&gt; not going there. &gt;&gt; But he hid something from the whole human race himself. &gt;&gt; God has the power to turn you young again. Why didn't the theologians preach this to you in the churches? &gt;&gt; Why didn't they? &gt;&gt; Why didn't they do it? &gt;&gt; Satan was there watching. &gt;&gt; I've asked minister after minister after minister, minister, what happened there? &gt;&gt; What happened there? &gt;&gt; Here's a man above 100 years old. Here's a woman above 90. What happened? They had a baby. &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; They've been married since they were children. What happened? &gt;&gt; Why would a king &gt;&gt; a gentile king, &gt;&gt; why would he, of all of the women of the whole land, &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm sorry. This just way it is. Why would he pick a 90-year-old woman? Why would he fall so crazy over heels in love with her? &gt;&gt; He's willing to kill him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's not looking at grandma. &gt;&gt; He don't need another quote. &gt;&gt; Abraham don't need &gt;&gt; He don't even need Melazdc to visit him anymore. &gt;&gt; It's on the way. I say this to you tonight, it's on the way. have gathered &gt;&gt; and don't know why. &gt;&gt; Two men that stood like we talked about last night &gt;&gt; that stood and talked with Jesus is getting ready to come back and preach them &gt;&gt; the feast of the trumpets which is the seven seals &gt;&gt; and they're going to preach with passion &gt;&gt; and they're going to take the scriptures &gt;&gt; and they're going to go through are you with me now? They're going to go all the way through the Old Testament and bring them to Revelation chapter 10. And I saw another mighty angel come down. &gt;&gt; And he did. And there was a bride that took the book and she ate the book and she become the book. And they did. They got rid of all of their church ideas. And they did. They ate it and they prophesied again. They were voices in Jeffersonville. They were voices in Vancouver. They were voices in the Shannondoa Valley. There were voices all over the earth. &gt;&gt; They were lights pressing against darkness. &gt;&gt; Martin Luther went into the ground and it's incredible the work that he did. &gt;&gt; It is said that it would take 15,000 men with secretaries to reproduce the work. &gt;&gt; But his favorite scripture was, "I must work while it is day. for night cometh. &gt;&gt; He wanted this to be in your in your hands. &gt;&gt; He wanted this open word to be in your hands. &gt;&gt; Don't never take it for granted when you put this under your arm &gt;&gt; and you walk into church. Martin Luther gave every ounce of energy that he could give so you and I could get this book in our hands. John Wesley, &gt;&gt; 5 foot one. &gt;&gt; He didn't stand out there with denominational preaching, but he preached with passion. &gt;&gt; He didn't have an internet to go around the world. That angel tried to light as many torches as he could light. &gt;&gt; Everybody must hear this. &gt;&gt; Everybody must hear this. &gt;&gt; His mama had prayed like no other woman had prayed &gt;&gt; cuz she was desperate. &gt;&gt; John Wesley was desperate. That's what would cause him to get on a boat and ride four months &gt;&gt; to come to America. &gt;&gt; That America could have this gospel. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "You will never know what this message has cost me." &gt;&gt; Your pastor was anointed &gt;&gt; to try to give Brother a break. Amen. &gt;&gt; To get him away to God's nature, &gt;&gt; not knowing that the torch would be handed &gt;&gt; because when Paul Rivere rode, nobody worshiped Paul Rivere, &gt;&gt; they simply caught the message &gt;&gt; and went out to fight. &gt;&gt; We love and respect brother Franom. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I give my life for him right now. &gt;&gt; But let me just say this to you. He was not the one who stepped out &gt;&gt; and took the book. &gt;&gt; He was the messenger. &gt;&gt; And God had men, &gt;&gt; prepared men, &gt;&gt; whether you want to believe it or not. The some of the greatest men that would ever put their feet in shoes. that would leave businesses, &gt;&gt; would leave homes &gt;&gt; and give their life for the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Cuz this message needs to be preached, brother Ernie, with power and demonstration. &gt;&gt; This message must come off of paper. &gt;&gt; It must live. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is a thunder that shakes the devil. &gt;&gt; This is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; If all you saw was Brother Brandham, you missed the picture. &gt;&gt; If all you saw was your favorite picture, favorite preacher, you missed the picture. But that same God, Deep Zoe, wants to live on the inside of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What have we felt this week? &gt;&gt; The same God that walked the earth 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; The same spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That stood in Tacoma, Washington. That stood in British Columbia. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that stood in Jeffersonville. And brother Bam stood there and said, "You know, I'm waiting on something. I'm as helpless as I can be without him. It was that spirit that we felt in this building. &gt;&gt; Well, I wish I could preach like brother Tim back there and just stand. But I wasn't built with that gear. &gt;&gt; Some of us are just kind of like raceh horses. You're either standing in a gate or you're running wide open. Sometimes I just sit in the pew and I go, "Wow, I'd love to be able to do it like that. Wow, isn't that amazing?" And then I get up here and try to do that and it's it's a waste of human effort. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? Time out. This will teach you to put your children in a corner. &gt;&gt; He's sitting over here smiling 20ome years ago. He was screaming in my ear &gt;&gt; and didn't know it. Run. &gt;&gt; Run with everything that's within you. &gt;&gt; Others have run. Now it's your turn to run. He didn't know me. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And I responded. &gt;&gt; I responded. I can't do it. &gt;&gt; But God, if it's your will, &gt;&gt; I'll give you every bit of energies that I can give you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just want to take one more note here just for a moment. David had some men gathered to him &gt;&gt; on the way to the throne. Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, and I I'm finishing up here in just a couple moments. I promise you, &gt;&gt; I'm out of fuel. The scripture says they were men in distress. Do we have any of those? &gt;&gt; They were men in trouble. &gt;&gt; They were bankrupt &gt;&gt; and they gathered themselves &gt;&gt; unto David. David had a desire one day if I could have a cool drink of brother Ron's water &gt;&gt; if I could have some water from Jacob's well &gt;&gt; cuz it's a covenant water. &gt;&gt; It's a water with promise. &gt;&gt; Three men, &gt;&gt; mighty gentile warriors. You know the story. But one of them put a sword in his hands and the scripture said he cle to that sword. &gt;&gt; He refused to let go of the grip of that sword. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And killed a brother said he jumped in a pit and killed 800 men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This ain't Hollywood. &gt;&gt; This ain't Hollywood. &gt;&gt; In his own energies, no way. &gt;&gt; But God signed the covenant with David. &gt;&gt; And he simply needed somebody that would jump in the pit. &gt;&gt; Don't have to be the best warrior. Don't have to have the best human fit to you. You don't have to have the brightest mind. You don't have to be an astronaut here. &gt;&gt; Just jump in the pit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One, two. He probably couldn't count to 20, but he just kept punching. He got so tired he couldn't hold his arm up. &gt;&gt; So he probably just held it like this right here and they kept dying. &gt;&gt; Don't never drop your sword. Now you see William Random stood on the side of the hill and on his knees praying and a sword appeared in his hand. He termed it the third pull, the king's sword. &gt;&gt; He did not keep it for himself. &gt;&gt; It was handed to you. Because your bone of our bridegroom's bones, &gt;&gt; your flesh of our bridegroom's flesh, &gt;&gt; your power of our bridegroom's power, your spirit of our Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You are him in bride form. &gt;&gt; And all of the prophets had been given a choice &gt;&gt; standing there. What age would you want to live in? &gt;&gt; I'd like to live in that that last age. This was the kind of anticipation that Martin Luther went into the ground with. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him look up on his face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; And a death angel walked into his door. Well, I know I'll come up &gt;&gt; Wesley. I know I'll come up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, I know I'll come up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have been handed that kind of a torch. &gt;&gt; We have been handed that kind of an expectation. &gt;&gt; Run with zeal. &gt;&gt; Run with urgency. &gt;&gt; Run with desperation. Don't let nothing get between you and God. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; You may leave this camp today and every devil in hell hits you. You were ordained. You were built to overcome this age. Don't let nothing get between you and God. I'm done, but this is going to be free. &gt;&gt; And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I saw I John saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven &gt;&gt; prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. &gt;&gt; I like this statement. Behold, I make all things new. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give yourselves a great big hand. Give the Lord a great big hand this evening. &gt;&gt; We must work while it is day. &gt;&gt; Every one of us have the same 24 hours. &gt;&gt; None of us are allotted any different. All right. &gt;&gt; Work. &gt;&gt; Run. &gt;&gt; Take what you got in your hand. Use it. &gt;&gt; Press the mark like never before. &gt;&gt; Forget those things which are behind. &gt;&gt; Forget what happened yesterday. &gt;&gt; Forget. Listen, I live with something that I have to forget. Every day I get burned up in my mind. Though I didn't see it, but I once I got past that accident, I had to put it in the back of my mind. &gt;&gt; Press towards the mark of the high calling. &gt;&gt; Run like you've never run before. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him look upon his face. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, where you at? There to sing forever of his amazing grace. If I have to wait 10,000 years to get my time at his feet, &gt;&gt; if my name is the last name called, &gt;&gt; it don't matter. &gt;&gt; If I have to wait 10,000 years or 20,000 years, it'll be worth the wait. &gt;&gt; But I'm sorry if you're behind me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, brother Kim. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All my hope, &gt;&gt; all my joy, all my energies &gt;&gt; are to see him. &gt;&gt; Well, oh, I want to see him. Look upon his face there to sing forever. Sing it, brother Ryan. Upon the streets of glory. &gt;&gt; Let's dance. Oh my. Is &gt;&gt; that your desire? &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his face. and sing forever. Oh my last to I want to see him upon his face and sing forever of glory. Here's all and oh that sounds so good. Can we sing it again? And all I want to see is forever. Ever see on the street ever to rejoice. One of them. One of them. One of them. And I'm so glad that I can say I say they were gathered. They were gathered in the array in his name. and power. I'm so glad that I get next I'm my brother. I will Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Want to say what I want to say? I'm so glad I &gt;&gt; Well, hate to say it. These are the closing comments. I feel like preaching actually. &gt;&gt; That's okay. I've got some meetings later on this week, so I have lots of opportunity. Don't worry, I won't do it to you. Well, you think it's hot here, young people, try hell. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yep. Try it sometime. I'd rather be sitting in an atmosphere like this in a presence of God and be sweating my brains out &gt;&gt; than being in a lost eternity, &gt;&gt; trapped and never able to get out. &gt;&gt; This isn't just for white-haired men like me &gt;&gt; and for parents that are standing behind you. For the promise is unto you and to your children &gt;&gt; and to your children's children. &gt;&gt; Don't look around the room. Look at me. &gt;&gt; We're not finished. Look at me. &gt;&gt; We want to exalt him &gt;&gt; for what he's done this week &gt;&gt; in our young people. &gt;&gt; Don't let your mind drift. Let's focus on what God has done this week. junior camp, senior camp, I want to give God all the glory, all the honor. &gt;&gt; And I think we can lift up our voices in thanksgiving and say, "Praise our God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus." &gt;&gt; I like what Brother Ron said last night, and I'm going to use it. I'm going to put it in my script bag. Don't you dare let somebody else worship for you. &gt;&gt; We are high priests. We are kings and priests unto God, offering a sacrifice of our praise. And if you can't open your mouth, I say you need an experience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In this atmosphere and what we've heard this week, saints of God, &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm ready to fly away &gt;&gt; and I'll fly away. Oh, glory. I got that expectation what I heard this morning in my heart. Same expectation St. Martin had, &gt;&gt; Luther had, Wesley had. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had. &gt;&gt; That same expectation is in me. &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful that we got Brother Jim Weber still here with us. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Jim. Hallelujah. Devil's got mad at you for some reason, Brother Jim. God watched over you because you've got something for us that I need. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Strengthen you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Could have been a different type of meeting, wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; Would have had just an overcast over this meeting and so concerned and brothers passed on, but he's here rejoicing in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I say to God be the glory. &gt;&gt; Young people, have God done something for you this week? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord, brother Ben. We've heard the run, haven't we? Run. &gt;&gt; Run with this message of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Wes, isn't it a joy to see the young people and see what God's doing in their lives? God bless you. &gt;&gt; Where's Brother Mark Stein ankle? Where are you? Are you I know there he is. Brother Mark came all the way from overseas to be here with us. We want to thank the Lord for brother Mark. God bless you, brother Mark. Amen. For all that have come to make these meetings possible, God bless you. And all the young people that put on this camp, God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm always amazed at what God raises up. You know, we often think, well, they can't do without me. Oh, you just watch. If I wasn't here tomorrow, somebody raise up. &gt;&gt; You can't do without me. I said can. Who? Who are you? &gt;&gt; God's got gifts in the body. Going to raise them up. &gt;&gt; This just didn't happen, saints. It was young men and young ladies &gt;&gt; that put this on. And I think you'd be able to thank them for their labors of love. Amen. God bless you all. And there's going to be a a booth next week at the fair. And we had a nice little meeting here in the morning. Brother Andy says, "Work so hard." And brother Matthew and the different ones that'll be there. We say, "God bless you. Thank you." And we're expecting great things. It's worth it. Brother Andy's one soul. One soul. It's worth it all. counselors. One soul that you've affected &gt;&gt; means more than me. A brother came up to me, gave me a big hug. Brother Tom, we love you. We appreciate all that you done for for us. You know what I said? Right there is enough reward. That's all I want. That's all to see you people fall in love with this God that I love, &gt;&gt; this message that I love. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tear your mask off as we've been preaching and just love him with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength and worship this God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love you, brother Larry. And I I'd like you to come up and close us in a word of prayer. Zeal still a fire and still a flame. Just a couple of announcements. the brothers. We're going to need 15 brothers afterwards to meet brother Tom Frey behind this tent to put this tent down later on. He'll coordinate 15 brothers. If you've got time this afternoon, would you please meet immediately behind the tent? Brother Tom Frey, registered campers and all those that are registered on grounds, we have a lunch uh available still for you. And the campers and counselors, we'd like you in the lower annex. We'll squeeze you in. I think there's some um different um awards and so forth that'll be passed out in the lower annex. We must remember Wednesday service is uh um not going to be we'll be uh returning to the church next Sunday. The sound all the sound equipment every all equipment that's here will get back to the church give you a few days to rest up and we're just going to have a time. You're going to have a time. I won't be there, but you're going to have a wonderful time on the Sunday morning with deep appreciation for all the sisters that labored in the kitchen. Really a very very deep appreciation. Yeah. I'm always humbled when I walk by that where they wash the dishes. That's one of my most humbling experiences. Every time I come to camp, see those sisters just working and brothers in there washing dishes for me, for you. May God bless them. &gt;&gt; I forget how many. It's well over 4,4,800 meals that get done in this senior camp. Plus then there's junior camp. I think that's amazing. How do you like to be stuck in a room for 6 hours and the spraying the steam and but I I I I do appreciate it. Sisters and brothers. God bless you with the cabins counselors. Please would you just do an extra special work? They have a camp coming in tomorrow and it would just make it extra special for brother Derek and Sister Debbie for all they do for us at this camp. If we could just put a little bit more elbow grease, make it just as clean as spotless as we can. And especially the ones that are up top of the hill, that's what's going to be um rented out first thing next week. So, whoever's in those cabins up top, would you just make an extra special effort to make it very clean? God bless you. something we look forward to all year has now come to a close. Whether we have another year or not, not all of us will be back next year. After we close, why don't you give each and everyone a very warmed greeting? Brother Miracle, God bless you. Coming all the way from Chicago, Illinois with his dear wife, going to go back for 32-hour drive. That's not so bad a commute, Brother Joseph. That's not so bad. It's only 32 hours. God bless you, Brother Joseph. We appreciate you. Well, God bless you all. Thank you for coming. Your prayers mean so much. Your support. Until we meet again, God be with you all. Let's just bow our hearts. Father, you are truly an allconsuming fire, oh God. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we ask now, Father, as the close of this specific meeting, Father, comes to a a close, Father, it's just the beginning &gt;&gt; of the fresh fire that's placed within us by your servants, Father, all over, Father. Those that are washing dishes, Father. Those that are tending the young ones in the nursery. Those that are running running the sound, Father. Those that are pick up the chairs, Father. Those that are pick up the trash. All of your servants, Father, full of that fire, Father. We ask in Jesus' name, Lord, that you would continue to consume us, Father, with your word, oh God, that everlasting word, that ever eternal word, Father, as we are absent from the body, we we would we will be present always and eternally with you, Father. I wrote in the leaf of my Bible, Father, today God, that if if that eternal God doesn't dwell us with within our hearts, Lord, we can no more die than you can die, Father, we will live eternally, Lord, and we will see our loved ones and we'll see the Lord Jesus Christ face to face one day. And Lord, we just yield ourselves to you, Father, and ask, Father, now for a refreshing upon those that labored so diligently throughout the hours and days and weeks and months of this meeting, Father, that you would refresh them. And brother Ron, a special blessing and supernatural energy. Pour into his body, oh God, in Jesus' name. He will not be empty no more, Lord. He is in that anointing, that fresh fire that you've placed within him, oh God, has now kindled our fire, Lord, as we brought our licks of fire. One from Oregon, and one from Chicago, Lord, and one from overseas, Lord, and all over through Canada, Lord, all through the United States, the South, the Northeast, and the West. Well, Lord, we've gathered here for one purpose. We're in purpose only, Lord, that we may have a closer walk with you, Lord. We want a closer walk with you, Lord. We want our young people to experience what we've been afforded as a young person. And God, we ask in Jesus' name that you would bless those that are here right now. And those on the internet, Lord, that are streaming the service. Father, may that same fire and that same energy that we feel here upon this platform be in their homes, in their hotel rooms, and we still remember Jock. Father, whatever the cause of this infirmity is, Lord, we rebuke it in Jesus' name. Father, he is a normal man of God. We ask you to lift him up, Father. Strengthen him now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. and those that have been afflicted by the enemy. Lord, we ask they would rise up and run the race that is set before us. Father, press the mark for the prize of the high calling of God. And Father, we just want to be at your feet. Lord, we want to know you for ourselves. Lord, bless every young person, every woman, every man, every boy, every girl. It's in this service today in divine presence who will archive these services. Father, that same anointing may touch their hearts. Fire them up, Father. When we get old, we don't just dwindle out. Lord, we just refire. Father, fire us up with your word, oh God, with the preaching we heard today. Father, how can anybody be still there just fire shut up in our bones, oh God, we cannot. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, God. Hallelujah. Oh father, thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy. Now go with us. Give us traveling mercies, Father. This one that drives 32 hours, Lord. Supernatural strength in his body, oh God. Father, bless and strengthen this brother. And we thank you, Father, for every man, bo, woman, boy, and girl that's under the sound of this voice now. Bless them, Lord, and go with them, Father, as we carry the fire. And Lord, as as these men gather at the the fair this week, Lord, we ask in Jesus' name, Lord, that you would move upon the hearts of those people that pass that booth, Lord, that they may sense the presence of Almighty God upon these warriors, Lord, whether they'd be young or old, Father, that you'd speak an oracle through their lips, oh God. Let the compassion and the love of Jesus Christ be projected out of them, Father, &gt;&gt; that they may be able to sense your wonderful presence as we feel it today in our bones, oh God. For we are bone of your bone, flesh of your flesh. And Lord, we just humbly bow before you now and thank you for your mercy, for your grace. Go with us now, Lord, as we yield ourselves to you for further work. We thank you for it in Jesus lovely name. Amen. And everyone said amen. &gt;&gt; Till we meet. Till we meet. Greet one another. Till we meet. And when you're finished greeting, would you mind just taking your chairs with you? They have pellets at the back. It would help the brothers so immensely. Thank you so much. Till we me.
