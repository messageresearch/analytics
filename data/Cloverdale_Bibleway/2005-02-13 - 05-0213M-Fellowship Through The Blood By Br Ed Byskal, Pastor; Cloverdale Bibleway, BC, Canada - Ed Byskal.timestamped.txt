[34:35] and I will ride

[36:40] [Music]
[36:48] Amen. God bless you.
[36:51] Nice to see everyone here building full
[36:55] all those that are visiting also with
[36:58] us. We nice to have a brother Paul and
[37:00] sister Jerry Haylet here and they
[37:03] brought another couple with them which
[37:06] we were able to meet last night. Brother
[37:08] Tim and sister Hedah Bream. Happy to
[37:12] have them as well. Brother Wolfram
[37:15] Hornshed and his daughter.
[37:18] I people journey a long ways to be with
[37:21] us in church. We appreciate that. God
[37:24] bless them. And uh perhaps there's
[37:26] others as well. We want to welcome
[37:30] everyone who's streaming.
[37:33] There's more and more.
[37:36] 122 locations were streaming the other
[37:39] last week and we just increased the
[37:42] number so more could be connected with
[37:46] us. We want to greet them in the name of
[37:49] the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm going to
[37:50] allow you just to have your seats for a
[37:52] few moments.
[37:54] Thank you for standing. Thank you for
[37:56] worshiping
[37:58] setting the atmosphere
[38:01] for the word which we're going to come
[38:04] to in just a few moments. Brother Tony
[38:06] is in uh Brazil. Uh they have arranged
[38:10] there's been some meetings that have
[38:11] been arranged there actually for a long
[38:12] time and I'm going to be joining him uh
[38:15] tomorrow uh just for the one week. I
[38:18] want you to pray. Pray for me if you
[38:20] would pray that I'll have strength and
[38:22] it's a a grueling trip to begin with and
[38:25] a grueling amount of meetings. They're
[38:28] going to have ministers meetings two and
[38:30] three a day uh for about three days and
[38:33] then evening meetings
[38:36] uh over the weekend and then back just
[38:38] Monday. So it's just go Monday, come
[38:41] back Monday. It's just like a U-turn.
[38:43] It's a very very long very very long
[38:46] journey.
[38:47] And uh but these meetings have actually
[38:50] been uh arranged for a long time. And uh
[38:55] God has
[38:57] uh God has really been gracious to South
[38:59] America. Although we have not had a lot
[39:00] of contact with uh with the believers
[39:04] there on a large scale, but there's been
[39:06] a real move of God in all of the South
[39:10] American countries. The last time we
[39:13] were there, there was probably at least
[39:15] 2,000 people in evening meetings and
[39:18] they didn't come from a long long ways.
[39:20] That was mostly local to the city of
[39:23] Chimpika. And now we're going to be in
[39:26] the northern part of Brazil called Bella
[39:29] Horizonti.
[39:31] Uh and uh the pastor there, he just a
[39:36] wonderful brother. We couldn't
[39:37] communicate because of our language
[39:39] problem. But you know the way God does
[39:42] things and I just want to drop it to the
[39:44] congregation so you know kind of what's
[39:46] happening.
[39:47] The first first invitation which we had
[39:50] it wasn't merely an invitation. They
[39:52] just pressed and pressed and pressed. We
[39:55] just like you to come down and we so we
[39:57] didn't know what it was all about but we
[39:59] felt a confirmation to go and of all of
[40:01] these years have never been uh into
[40:05] Brazil. And the pastor there at uh
[40:08] Brazil speaks Portuguese and the pastor
[40:12] who was hosting the meeting he had such
[40:15] a burden for missions. So
[40:19] he has traveled to Africa to Mosmb beek
[40:24] many times and through his uh labors
[40:29] there there have been many many when I
[40:32] say many I'm talking there was about 200
[40:36] churches he asked the believers in
[40:39] Malawi to care for that he had had he'd
[40:43] been instrumental in having those and
[40:46] many many more started he actually
[40:49] mentioned about 500 groups that have
[40:53] been assembling in Mosmb beek and Mosmb
[40:56] beek is Portuguese. So he they were just
[41:00] so burdened because he said you know we
[41:02] go over and the holy spirit calls the
[41:06] people but when we leave we have nothing
[41:10] to leave them. we don't have sufficient
[41:12] books in Portuguese. And uh so I I
[41:17] attempted then at in the ministers
[41:19] meetings to assemble their resources
[41:22] together and they had a couple families
[41:25] that were devoted to translation work
[41:28] and one was around Rio Sa Paulo area I
[41:32] believe and the other was more to the
[41:34] north of Brazil.
[41:37] So we we tried to introduce to them look
[41:39] what you need to do is you know uh get
[41:43] your efforts together and then you'll be
[41:46] able to you do the translations and I'll
[41:49] speak to brother doa in Congo cuz that's
[41:52] the thing you need to do you know don't
[41:55] want to print it over here or in Brazil
[41:58] get uh have it done in in Congo and and
[42:02] it's already in Africa and they can just
[42:03] ship it down to Mosmb beek well it all
[42:06] sounded good. Uh but uh for the last
[42:09] couple of years almost it's been kind of
[42:12] grinding your wheels in the sand and and
[42:14] uh
[42:16] uh you know people get a little ministry
[42:18] whether it be translating work and
[42:20] printing a few message books or whatever
[42:23] it might be they get a little ministry
[42:24] and then it was the same thing in the
[42:26] Ukraine and then they begin to feel well
[42:29] if they get any direction from outside
[42:33] you know somehow they're going to lose
[42:35] their work they're going to lose their
[42:36] identity it's going to get swapped
[42:37] swallowed up in something bigger. Well,
[42:39] my that's what we're here for. Let let
[42:42] it get swallowed up and let it get
[42:44] spread and let it get, you know, voiced
[42:47] abroad.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; So, uh, we we said, "Well, we'll do what
[42:52] we can." And I went to Congo and I spoke
[42:54] with Brother Dioa and he was all geared
[42:56] up and ready to do, you know, what they
[42:59] could do. And we we said, "Well, we will
[43:01] assist with those books, Lord willing,
[43:03] if we're able. will exist financially to
[43:07] have those books printed uh in the Congo
[43:11] and well it never really came about you
[43:14] know some message books uh uh some
[43:17] translations were it was so slow and
[43:20] it's hard to coordinate things and just
[43:21] like kind of grinding your wheels in the
[43:23] sand and brother brother Tony you know
[43:26] he kind of came to the end we couldn't
[43:28] do much more then we get these phone
[43:30] calls now and they said we're now ready.
[43:34] We're ready. We're ready to cooperate.
[43:36] We're ready to work together over here.
[43:38] We're ready, but we don't know exactly
[43:40] how to do it. Come and help us set this
[43:42] thing up and come and teach us and come
[43:45] and tell us what you've learned over
[43:47] these years and how this should function
[43:49] and what a blessing it can be. And we're
[43:51] just kind of we'll be at your disposal.
[43:53] So, we said, well, on those grounds,
[43:55] we'd come down. So, that's what we're on
[43:58] our way to do. And at the same time, of
[44:00] course, you know, the way it always is,
[44:02] they they don't want just that. Let's
[44:04] have some meetings, too. So, we'll have
[44:07] some meetings, Lord willing.
[44:10] God pouring out his grace upon us. So,
[44:13] that's what we're looking forward to.
[44:17] While we're gathered here to worship
[44:18] him,
[44:19] &gt;&gt; you've been worshiping. And uh I thought
[44:23] before we read the scripture, we could
[44:25] just stand and sing peace like a river,
[44:27] love like a fountain. And we want his
[44:30] presence. And I am desiring,
[44:33] you know, without him, we can do nothing
[44:35] today.
[44:39] And I'm sure you recognize that we need
[44:42] him desperately. We need him perhaps
[44:44] more than we realize. So let's unite our
[44:48] hearts. Would you do that? Would you
[44:50] say, "Brother Ed, I'll unite my heart
[44:53] with yours
[44:55] &gt;&gt; and pray that God will come amongst us,
[44:59] meet us in a special way." Amen.
[45:04] Peace
[45:06] like a river
[45:12] like a mountain.
[45:17] With
[45:18] God your spirit
[45:23] is glowing
[45:25] everywhere
[45:31] like a mountain
[45:37] stream.
[45:40] [Music]
[45:43] Holy Spirit,
[45:47] let your power
[45:49] [Music]
[45:50] fall once again. Peace like a river.
[45:54] Peace like
[46:02] the mountain.
[46:05] The king
[46:07] of your spit
[46:11] is glory
[46:15] [Music]
[46:19] like the mountain.
[46:23] [Music]
[46:28] Oh come
[46:30] Holy Spirit.
[46:34] Let your fire
[46:36] [Music]
[46:39] holy spirit come
[46:42] Holy Spirit.
[46:46] Let your power
[46:50] everyone once more now.
[46:54] Holy Spirit,
[46:57] let your fire.
[47:00] [Music]
[47:04] May he grant it in Jesus name.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're coming now to
[47:09] open the scriptures. We can turn its
[47:13] pages as your prophet said, but we
[47:15] cannot reveal it. You must reveal it by
[47:18] the Holy Spirit. Let there be a spirit
[47:21] of revelation upon every person that's
[47:24] listening in, oh God. Every person
[47:27] within the walls of this building, we
[47:30] pray, oh Lord, you'll be lifted up,
[47:33] glorified.
[47:34] May your majesty, oh God, be seen and
[47:38] visible. Heal the sick and afflicted. I
[47:42] pray deliver them. We want to glorify
[47:45] you for what we've heard in the good
[47:47] reports, Lord, for the complete healing
[47:50] of our brother Bessie. God, how we
[47:52] rejoice. We have prayed publicly and
[47:55] have prayed in our private chambers, but
[47:58] now you have done this work. And others
[48:01] that are so needy, Lord, the prayers
[48:03] have been made and we know that you
[48:05] heard us. And now, oh Lord, I pray that
[48:08] you'll give grant us, Lord, the Holy
[48:12] Spirit's ability as I stand at the post
[48:16] of duty. May we speak the words that you
[48:18] would have said and be silent, oh God,
[48:21] on those things you would not have said.
[48:23] Let the hearts of the people be open.
[48:26] May the seed fall into good ground in
[48:29] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:34] God bless you. We're going to turn in
[48:36] our Bibles to Psalms the 86th chapter.
[48:40] And then when you're seated, you can
[48:43] keep your Bibles open if you would like.
[48:45] I have a number of scriptures that I
[48:47] will be referring to.
[48:50] But we're going to read together, and
[48:53] I'll have you read with me
[48:56] in unison
[48:58] verses 11 and 12 of Psalms 86.
[49:05] Teach me thy way, O Lord. I will walk in
[49:10] thy truth. Unite my heart to fear thy
[49:14] name. I will praise thee, oh Lord my
[49:18] God, with all my heart and I will
[49:22] glorify thy name forever more. And
[49:26] everyone said, "Amen." Thus shall it be.
[49:30] God bless you. You may be seated.
[49:37] Brother Brandham took these two verses
[49:39] in the message the uniting time and sign
[49:44] and I want to
[49:47] uh speak a rather difficult subject for
[49:50] me. It may seem very very simple and
[49:52] elementary to you. But if God will allow
[49:56] you to reach out more or less where my
[50:00] thoughts and mind has been and if he
[50:02] will give me the ability to draw you in
[50:05] to what the Holy Spirit has been
[50:08] speaking to me about. Sometimes a
[50:10] preacher wrestles over not over a
[50:14] subject but wrestles over how to deliver
[50:16] it and how to make it real like it's
[50:20] been real to my own heart. And so I want
[50:22] to try to convey to you
[50:26] uh this uniting
[50:30] as David had said, "Unite my heart
[50:36] to fear thy name. I will be speaking
[50:39] also very much upon the blood
[50:43] because the blood is a unifying force.
[50:47] It's a not only a lifegiving force but
[50:50] it's a uniting force. And uh I want to
[50:55] just go back for a moment in your
[50:58] imagination and in your spiritual
[51:01] thoughts
[51:02] and see God try to comprehend him just
[51:07] for a moment. Although we cannot we
[51:09] can't even begin to comprehend them. But
[51:11] I would like you just to somewhere
[51:15] in the eternities. We're creatures of
[51:17] time so we think of things in terms of
[51:19] time. But somewhere in the eternities
[51:22] before there was anything of creation.
[51:26] Here's this
[51:28] being that fills all time and space
[51:32] filled with attributes.
[51:34] a creator that has not yet created
[51:38] uh by himself. He's alone, not even God
[51:44] yet because there's nothing worshiping
[51:46] him. Perhaps not even a creation of a
[51:50] universe as as yet. And brother Brandom
[51:55] said he sat alone with his thoughts. Uh
[51:59] a a god with a mind and filled with
[52:02] thoughts and filled with power, filled
[52:06] with attributes. And brother Brandham
[52:09] said he loved fatherhood. Somewhere
[52:12] amongst all of those attributes, he
[52:14] loved fatherhood. And how he did by his
[52:17] word, we do not know. Only we do know
[52:21] that all things were made by him. And
[52:24] this power, this logos that came out
[52:27] from God, a creative power, a creative
[52:30] force, and he begins to create,
[52:33] he says, uh, uh, like a clinker
[52:38] maybe spun off of the sun and a burning
[52:42] molten clinker and it fell perhaps for a
[52:46] 100 million years in space. I thought I
[52:50] would try to bring something to you uh
[52:53] so I could relate and make something
[52:55] relative as far as the space and
[52:58] universe is concerned but I found it too
[53:00] cumbersome. I found it too enormous. I
[53:03] got to the place where if you took one
[53:06] step it was 3 million uh 600,000
[53:10] years uh of light space and uh I I I
[53:14] just got lost in it. So, I I thought we
[53:16] could get get, you know, I've read where
[53:18] they've had, you know, the planetary
[53:20] systems and everything uh down where you
[53:23] if you put a like a a P here, you'd have
[53:26] to go so far and then and then we're
[53:29] just talking about our own galaxy and
[53:31] and we start talking about the universe,
[53:33] you just get lost. You talk about a
[53:35] planet, this this planet will be a pin
[53:38] head over here. Then he left to walk 26
[53:40] yards with three million uh three
[53:43] million light years at every step. And
[53:46] then and we didn't have enough space in
[53:47] this building. Even if we made
[53:49] everything so minute, this earth would
[53:51] only be a particle of dust. And that
[53:53] would just be our universe.
[53:55] Not our universe, but our galaxy. And
[53:58] you just couldn't even begin to begin to
[54:00] speak about it. I'm talking about God
[54:03] that filled all of that and a lot more.
[54:05] this being that we we speak about we
[54:08] call him our God, our father which art
[54:11] in heaven. Is he ever in heaven?
[54:15] &gt;&gt; And saw this clinker fall maybe a 100
[54:18] million years who knows how fell and
[54:21] then by his words stopped. We can't even
[54:25] imagine that. We don't even know how it
[54:26] happened. Stopped it and it be to simmer
[54:30] down. And there were certain elements
[54:32] that were there potsh and various
[54:36] elements. He said what was he doing?
[54:38] Here was a prophet saying what was he
[54:40] doing? He's making you
[54:43] &gt;&gt; in that great mind. He was thinking
[54:47] about a family.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; That attribute of fatherhood
[54:53] was rising and coming to the surface. I
[54:57] want to have children. And that is why
[55:00] at the end of this book as it ends, it
[55:04] says, "And I will be his God, and he
[55:08] will be my son."
[55:10] &gt;&gt; That's what was in him.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; He'll be a He's going to have a son. And
[55:16] for those of you that have had children,
[55:19] one thing is sure, the blood of the
[55:21] father is in the child.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; They have been unified. they've been
[55:27] brought into. We have what we call
[55:28] bloodlines
[55:30] and uh uh we we have various terminology
[55:34] that refers to the the unifying force
[55:39] and power of the blood. I thought of God
[55:44] and Job thought of him and God had a
[55:47] conversation with Job and I I suppose
[55:50] this really began to expand Job's mind.
[55:54] He said, "Where were you when I laid the
[55:57] foundations of the earth? Whereupon are
[56:00] the foundations thereof fastened? Or who
[56:04] laid the cornerstone thereof?" God began
[56:07] to ask him questions that would in our
[56:10] terminology really uh challenge his
[56:14] mind. When the morning stars sang
[56:17] together and all the sons of God shouted
[56:20] for joy, "Where were you, Job? Where
[56:21] were you? Where was I?
[56:24] My goodness, we can't even imagine where
[56:26] we were. But we were somewhere in the
[56:29] mind and thoughts of Almighty God. If
[56:31] God is God, if there ever was a being
[56:33] like God. And the prophet said he knew
[56:36] every knat, every flea, every time it
[56:38] would bat its eyes and how much tallow
[56:40] it would make if it were if it were
[56:42] rendered down. He knew every last. He
[56:44] knew every time you're going to blink on
[56:46] earth.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; He knew everything about you. He knows
[56:49] us, my brother, my sister. And if he
[56:52] didn't, then he wouldn't be a God worth
[56:54] serving. I thank him that he's that kind
[56:56] of a God. And he knows every last detail
[56:59] of our lives. He He knows and he's put
[57:02] us here for a purpose. He's asking Job,
[57:07] "Who shut up the sea with doors when it
[57:10] broke forth? And when it issued out of
[57:12] the womb, when I made the cloud, the
[57:15] garment thereof, and the thick darkness,
[57:18] uh, a swaddling bag for it, a swaddling
[57:20] band, rather, hast thou commanded the
[57:23] morning since thy days, and caused the
[57:26] daypring to know its place? Hast thou
[57:29] entered into the springs of the sea? Uh,
[57:32] hast thou walked the in the search of
[57:34] the death? Hast thou perceived the
[57:37] breath of the earth? Declare if thou
[57:40] knowest it. I tell you that no wonder
[57:43] Job said, I'll put my hand over my
[57:45] mouth. I won't say anything.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Who's going to say anything when you
[57:49] start hearing things like this?
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Hast thou commanded the morning? He
[57:54] asked. And then he went on thou bind the
[57:57] secret influences of Pleiades or loose
[58:00] the bands of Orion cast thou bring forth
[58:04] Mazeroth in his season all these uh uh
[58:08] planetary systems. What do you know
[58:11] about these things? Thou guide Arcturus
[58:14] with his sons knowest thou the
[58:17] ordinances of heavens? Cast thou set
[58:19] dominion thereof? I'm sure that Job's
[58:22] mind was trying to grasp this God. And
[58:26] yet the prophet said, Job, he wanted to
[58:29] come up to his house. He wanted to find,
[58:32] is there someone who can give me some
[58:34] hope beyond this life?
[58:38] &gt;&gt; I'd like to Is there a Is there a God?
[58:40] I'd like to go up to his door. I want to
[58:43] knock. He said he wanted a God with skin
[58:45] on.
[58:47] There's
[58:48] &gt;&gt; something within us
[58:49] &gt;&gt; that cries out for a God that can
[58:52] understand this dimension that we're in
[58:55] and what we go through and what we
[58:57] experience. And that's why so many
[58:59] people who don't even know God say, "Why
[59:00] am I here? What is this all about? They
[59:04] need God. We need God. You need God. I
[59:07] need God. I need this kind of a God." We
[59:10] don't only need some being that fills
[59:12] all time and space. But what makes God
[59:14] great is he could reduce himself down
[59:17] down and become a blood cell
[59:21] &gt;&gt; in the womb of a woman, a virgin.
[59:24] Hallelujah.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; And that is something that just is
[59:27] beyond the mind to comprehend. The
[59:31] Jewish people, they can't comprehend
[59:33] that. They know that there's a God and
[59:36] he spoke to a prophet and he spoke to
[59:38] Moses and and brought the word and so
[59:40] and so. Can't imagine a god that could
[59:43] become a blood cell. But that was the
[59:45] unifying force. He had to unify because
[59:49] it was blood that broke us from him.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; The scripture says through Isaiah,
[59:59] jumping around a wee bit back and forth.
[1:00:01] Thus say the Lord spoke Isaiah. The
[1:00:04] heaven is my throne and the earth is my
[1:00:06] foottool. But where's the house that
[1:00:08] you'll build me? And where's the place
[1:00:10] of my rest? Where's the house? How will
[1:00:12] my household be structured? How is this
[1:00:15] going to happen? The whole heavens are
[1:00:18] my throne and the earth is my foottool.
[1:00:22] This whole earth just a foottool for
[1:00:25] God. Where's my household is what he's
[1:00:28] asking.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:31] And as I said moment ago and he is
[1:00:35] closing the book,
[1:00:38] closing the scriptures. I'm alpha and
[1:00:40] omega, the beginning and the end.
[1:00:43] Speaking of the faithful, he that
[1:00:45] overcomemeth shall inherit all things.
[1:00:49] He that overcomemeth shall inherit all
[1:00:51] things, and I will be his God, and he
[1:00:54] shall be my son.
[1:00:57] That's the cry of the heart of almighty
[1:01:00] God.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Not just sunship as some relationship as
[1:01:05] we know in the human in our human realm,
[1:01:09] but sunship in an inseparable union
[1:01:13] that's brought about
[1:01:16] by a lif stream. And God conceived in
[1:01:20] his mind
[1:01:22] that he would form and make
[1:01:26] someone in his image.
[1:01:28] This is going to be different. It's
[1:01:31] going to give him life. God can't learn
[1:01:34] anything. He knew it from beginning from
[1:01:36] the end.
[1:01:40] There's going to be a a seed, a sperm
[1:01:44] that is going to come into a bedding
[1:01:48] ground
[1:01:51] of a womb.
[1:01:54] And life is going to be conceived.
[1:01:59] And it'll be birthed through a process
[1:02:02] of birth.
[1:02:05] And it'll have
[1:02:08] a circulatory system. It'll have blood
[1:02:14] and in the blood will be alive.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; This was in the mind of God.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Don't worry friends, Satan knew
[1:02:26] something about this
[1:02:29] because
[1:02:30] Jesus said he was a murderer
[1:02:33] from the beginning.
[1:02:36] He was a sheddder of blood from the
[1:02:39] beginning.
[1:02:42] Now follow me real close.
[1:02:46] Before
[1:02:49] before Cain slew Abel, before he slew
[1:02:53] Abel, before it was blood that was on
[1:02:56] the ground for God, you know the first
[1:02:59] the first time the word blood appears in
[1:03:01] the scripture, it is spoken by God
[1:03:03] himself.
[1:03:06] He says to a, it says to Cain,
[1:03:10] "Where's your brother?
[1:03:13] His blood crith unto me from the ground.
[1:03:17] Where is it?" And it was this sin, a
[1:03:20] blood sin that caused the separation.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Blood was involved in the separation.
[1:03:28] But before it was blood that was spilled
[1:03:30] to the ground, it was a word. Before it
[1:03:32] was blood, it was a word. Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; And the word was you shall not surely
[1:03:36] die
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; before it became uh that that crime it
[1:03:44] was a word. It started with a word and
[1:03:47] then it evolved and became an act. It
[1:03:50] was a first a word then it was an act
[1:03:54] and then and the separation took place.
[1:03:59] David says
[1:04:02] in our scripture, "Unite
[1:04:06] my heart."
[1:04:09] And the heart according to the Hebrew
[1:04:13] can be the inner man,
[1:04:15] the mind,
[1:04:18] the soul,
[1:04:20] the understanding.
[1:04:22] Unite my soul.
[1:04:25] Unite my understanding.
[1:04:27] goes on. Unite the seed of my emotions.
[1:04:33] Unite my emotions
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; to fear thy name. Oh, I tell you what,
[1:04:41] this is a very emotional age that we're
[1:04:43] in. People are geared and live by their
[1:04:46] emotions. And I can tell you what, a lot
[1:04:48] of those emotions aren't they're not uh
[1:04:51] they don't fear God.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Says, "Unite my heart to fear thy name.
[1:04:56] Unite my unite the very seed of my
[1:04:59] emotions
[1:05:01] passions. Unite my passions to fear thy
[1:05:06] name.
[1:05:11] The center of all physical and spiritual
[1:05:15] life. The fountain and seed of my
[1:05:17] thoughts. Uh even here this morning.
[1:05:21] Everyone, we all have our own individual
[1:05:23] little
[1:05:25] thinking process or mindset. But I would
[1:05:28] like this congregation this morning to
[1:05:31] say within yourself, "Oh God, unite my
[1:05:35] thoughts,
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; to fear your name."
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; So often our thoughts bring all kinds of
[1:05:40] other fears. We fear life. We fear the
[1:05:43] future. We fear about our health. We
[1:05:45] fear about retirement. We have concerns.
[1:05:48] We're made anxious about this, about the
[1:05:50] pressures of life, our finances, and and
[1:05:53] whatever more. We have all kinds of
[1:05:55] concerns, but we should say this
[1:05:57] morning, this congregation should say,
[1:05:59] "Cause me to fear. Let my thoughts fear
[1:06:02] your name.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Take your name into reverence.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Let my thoughts, let my emotions, let
[1:06:08] the very seed of my passions, let them
[1:06:11] all be consumed to fear your name and
[1:06:15] reverence your name." I can tell you my
[1:06:17] brother, my sister, to a man or a woman
[1:06:18] that does that, everything else will
[1:06:21] fall into place.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That is serving God first, putting him
[1:06:25] first.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; That is the whole being.
[1:06:36] Cause me,
[1:06:39] unite
[1:06:41] my heart
[1:06:43] to fear your name.
[1:06:47] Now how how does this happen in reality?
[1:06:53] Blood as I said earlier
[1:06:56] is a unifying force. Blood is signifies
[1:07:00] the ultimate union.
[1:07:04] Blood in the old testament is considered
[1:07:08] to be the life principle.
[1:07:13] There's been much mystery attached to
[1:07:15] it.
[1:07:18] Uh as I studied this
[1:07:22] subject and in the scripture you'll find
[1:07:27] there there's there was an awe and there
[1:07:30] was a reverence
[1:07:32] attached almost a mysterious aspect
[1:07:37] attached to the shedding of blood.
[1:07:40] And don't forget, I said God was the
[1:07:42] first one to mention that now.
[1:07:44] And and man, you could go to the most
[1:07:48] illiterate peoples and you'll find that
[1:07:52] somehow they'll have some blood rights,
[1:07:56] some kind of ceremony that they'll keep
[1:07:59] with blood.
[1:08:02] years ago, some years ago, and we were
[1:08:04] in Nepal
[1:08:06] and were up in an area
[1:08:09] found a place where they were
[1:08:10] worshiping, where the people worship,
[1:08:14] no knowledge, as I know of the God that
[1:08:17] you and I serve.
[1:08:19] But we were going to go through a little
[1:08:21] doorway in a wall. I said, I saw it was
[1:08:25] a dark red color over the door. I said,
[1:08:28] "What is this?" They said, "It's blood.
[1:08:31] They kill a goat and they smear blood
[1:08:34] over this doorway.
[1:08:36] Almost identical
[1:08:38] to the Passover.
[1:08:41] You put blood. They didn't know why, but
[1:08:44] they just something in them. In some of
[1:08:46] the tribes in Africa, they will scarify
[1:08:51] their skin as you know, but the reason
[1:08:53] they do that is to draw blood. And then
[1:08:56] they have like this inner transfusion of
[1:09:00] blood. They want to bind themselves
[1:09:03] together and know that they are in a in
[1:09:06] inseparable
[1:09:09] brotherhood and uh uh they then they
[1:09:12] will take each other's blood and and
[1:09:14] smear it upon one another. So they have
[1:09:17] some uh inner transfusion of of this
[1:09:21] blood rights and they feel it that now
[1:09:23] now this union is made complete but it
[1:09:26] can't be made complete without that act.
[1:09:29] They have that uh and and they have many
[1:09:32] many others.
[1:09:34] Uh the mutual shedding of blood and uh
[1:09:38] uh it is brought it into and considered
[1:09:40] to be a brotherhood or a blood
[1:09:43] friendship or blood fellowship.
[1:09:48] Now uh
[1:09:51] when God when God spoke to the serpent,
[1:09:55] imagine now he spoke to the serpent, not
[1:09:57] a snake but to this being
[1:10:00] and uh he he he said that that the seed
[1:10:04] of the woman.
[1:10:06] Now in the seed of the woman, you're
[1:10:08] going to just do a little swimming in a
[1:10:10] moment. In the seed of the woman, the
[1:10:14] blood of the child comes from the man.
[1:10:18] It's in the It's in a hemoglobin. It's
[1:10:20] in that seed. They can tell the child.
[1:10:23] They can test it to see who the father
[1:10:25] is. And God had ordained it to be that
[1:10:29] way. And he said that the seed of the
[1:10:32] woman will bruise your head.
[1:10:36] God created that seed for the first
[1:10:39] time. When Jesus Christ was conceived,
[1:10:43] for the first time, God intercepted
[1:10:46] humanity
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; with another blood cell.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; This was a different one, folks.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; There's a different life coming forth.
[1:10:56] And that one was going to bruise his
[1:10:58] head.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; He brought the separation through a
[1:11:01] blood sin. That's good.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And Christ is going to bring the
[1:11:06] unifying force once again by the newly
[1:11:09] created blood of Almighty God.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; And he's speaking to
[1:11:20] speaking to Cain said, "What hast thou
[1:11:23] done? The voice of thy brother's blood
[1:11:26] crith unto me from the ground." What did
[1:11:29] God hear? I don't know.
[1:11:31] What sound was it? I don't know.
[1:11:35] But this is what God said. Do you
[1:11:37] believe God?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; You believe he said the truth.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "The blood, your brother's
[1:11:43] blood crith to me from the ground." That
[1:11:46] wasn't the first time. I mean, that may
[1:11:48] have been the first time, but that
[1:11:50] wasn't the last time that God was going
[1:11:51] to hear that. We spoke about the
[1:11:55] terrible things that have happened to
[1:11:57] the Jewish people all down. Uh there's
[1:11:59] one thing that that uh one thing that is
[1:12:02] is common in their history from age to
[1:12:05] age to age is the blood of those people
[1:12:08] have cried from the ground of the earth
[1:12:11] and God has heard it
[1:12:17] in the future home. Prophet just says
[1:12:20] the sperm from the male carries a
[1:12:23] hemoglobin which is the blood and in the
[1:12:26] blood is the life
[1:12:29] and in that life is a nature the soul
[1:12:34] and Satan the serpent got to Eve before
[1:12:37] Adam got to her. That's right. So he
[1:12:41] beguiled her. So, Satan, the serpent,
[1:12:44] was the husband to Eve before Adam ever
[1:12:48] knew. And that follows all through the
[1:12:51] scripture.
[1:12:52] All through the scripture, the Satan got
[1:12:56] to Israel before God, before Jesus was
[1:12:59] even there. There were religious orders
[1:13:01] there, all kinds of beliefs and
[1:13:03] doctrines and traditions when Jesus came
[1:13:06] on the scene. And Jesus was the seed of
[1:13:08] God.
[1:13:12] Now the that act united us with a fallen
[1:13:17] race.
[1:13:20] You don't have to teach your children to
[1:13:22] do wrong.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; You can take you can take your child.
[1:13:28] You can take any child. You can isolate
[1:13:31] them. They never hear a bad word. Never
[1:13:35] see a wrong act. Never involved. don't
[1:13:39] have any peer pressure. You can take
[1:13:41] them, but deep down somewhere within
[1:13:45] the inner being of that child, there'll
[1:13:48] be a fallen nature.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; And there's a a belief today, a strong
[1:13:54] belief that we're essentially born good
[1:13:58] and we're become bad by outside
[1:14:01] influences.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Well, that just doesn't happen to be the
[1:14:04] case.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; It just is not the case. You can have
[1:14:08] them and protect them and do all that
[1:14:10] you want, but there is a fallen nature
[1:14:12] there and it will surely manifest itself
[1:14:15] at some point in time.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; That is true.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; We know that is the case. And so we were
[1:14:25] actually united
[1:14:28] with that fallen nature. And brother
[1:14:31] Brandham calls it your first husband.
[1:14:34] What is a husband?
[1:14:38] What is a husband and wife? A
[1:14:39] relationship,
[1:14:41] an intimacy.
[1:14:43] And we were united through your sexual
[1:14:47] birth, your natural birth. You were
[1:14:49] reunited with a fallen nature. Right.
[1:14:56] And that is that is so uh I mean we
[1:15:01] wrestle with it but that is so much a
[1:15:03] fact of life that we were born with that
[1:15:07] nature
[1:15:08] and and and even after a person has been
[1:15:12] born again. Satan doesn't give up
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; on trying to plague you
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; with that old characteristics of the
[1:15:21] fallen nature. And we have weaknesses
[1:15:23] and we hardly know where the line is. Is
[1:15:25] that is that the devil or is that just
[1:15:27] me or what is that?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; You all know what I'm talking about.
[1:15:34] That that hangover thing and that and
[1:15:37] and and Satan will do everything that he
[1:15:40] can to plague the son and daughter of
[1:15:42] God
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; with that uh uh from the throwback I'll
[1:15:48] say of the fallen nature.
[1:15:51] Jesus did not come and God did not
[1:15:55] create this blood cell that flowed in
[1:15:59] the veins of Jesus Christ to make us 50%
[1:16:03] or 75% or 99% free from the old nature.
[1:16:08] He came to divorce us from that nature.
[1:16:12] And through the body of Christ, that old
[1:16:14] husband is dead.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; And that's what Paul says in Romans. And
[1:16:19] we are made alive to be to be united to
[1:16:24] be married to another.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Not only to be married to another. Now
[1:16:30] listen close. Not only to be married to
[1:16:33] another, but to bring forth fruit unto
[1:16:36] him.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; And that does not come by a casual
[1:16:41] acquaintance.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; That comes by an intimate act.
[1:16:46] It's a spiritual thing, but it is deeper
[1:16:48] than even the natural.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; The spiritual thing I'm speaking about
[1:16:57] is not coming to church. That intimacy
[1:17:00] is not necessarily coming into the house
[1:17:02] of God. That's not the necessarily the
[1:17:04] intimacy. The intimacy I'm speaking
[1:17:06] about is not someone just having being
[1:17:09] sorry for their sin and shedding some
[1:17:11] tears. That's not just it. But it's when
[1:17:13] God acknowledges your faith and the
[1:17:18] election of almighty God and you know
[1:17:21] that you've been called by him and the
[1:17:24] Holy Spirit is calling you and drawing
[1:17:27] you and finally you break your will your
[1:17:30] self-will and stubbornness breaks down
[1:17:32] and you say yes Lord I repent oh God I
[1:17:37] recognize that is you that is doing it
[1:17:40] and God sends his spirit into you and
[1:17:43] there's a there's a a an act that takes
[1:17:45] place.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; God himself, he comes and unites with
[1:17:50] you and that that is a birth that takes
[1:17:53] place. It's by water, it's by blood and
[1:17:57] it's by spirit.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; For the life is in the blood and that
[1:18:01] life of God comes into the individual.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; And that's a irrevocable act of almighty
[1:18:09] God. He will not take that back. He
[1:18:12] said, "I will be his God, and he'll be
[1:18:14] my son.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; She'll be my daughter,
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; and I'm not sorry for it." And I didn't
[1:18:19] think about it just yesterday. That was
[1:18:21] way back.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Someplace in the eternities,
[1:18:26] God conceived. He'll have a daughter
[1:18:28] just like you, a son just like you.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And I have an attribute in this great
[1:18:34] being. I have an attribute. And they're
[1:18:36] going to carry that attribute. They're
[1:18:38] going to carry it uniquely. And I'll
[1:18:41] make them so different
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; there won't ever even they won't I won't
[1:18:44] even repeat their fingerprints on again
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; no one else will ever carry that that
[1:18:52] imprint of their fingerprint. No one
[1:18:54] else will even look like them. There'll
[1:18:57] be other that resemble them but no one
[1:18:59] will look like them. They'll be so
[1:19:01] unique they'll have a different number
[1:19:03] of hairs in their head and I'll know
[1:19:05] every one of them.
[1:19:08] They'll be so unique. They'll just be
[1:19:10] different in every way. And God himself
[1:19:14] saw that even through the natural birth,
[1:19:16] this one bred to that one to that one,
[1:19:18] to that one, to that one to bring forth
[1:19:20] a certain creature, a certain being. And
[1:19:23] then God himself knew in his election
[1:19:26] that I he will he will uh uh cross the
[1:19:30] footsteps of this individual somehow
[1:19:33] some place through some vessel through
[1:19:36] some preacher through some through some
[1:19:38] message book or some Bible or whatever
[1:19:41] more. He's going to cross their
[1:19:42] footstep. He's going to touch their
[1:19:44] heart and they're going to surrender.
[1:19:46] He's going to have this Holy Spirit on
[1:19:48] their trail until they do surrender.
[1:19:53] Then I'm going to unite with them.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Going to unite with them
[1:19:59] in an intimacy
[1:20:02] that goes far beyond
[1:20:05] any human natural relationship or
[1:20:07] marriage.
[1:20:09] Every one of us here that are a child of
[1:20:12] we are a child of someone else.
[1:20:17] You can never change that.
[1:20:21] You can make disgrace the family name.
[1:20:25] They can disown you.
[1:20:29] Your father can stroke you out of his
[1:20:31] will.
[1:20:38] You can you can uh yourself flee to the
[1:20:42] farthest corner of the earth, but you
[1:20:44] can never change
[1:20:46] never change the fact that you are that
[1:20:51] man or woman's child
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; and you came by a certain seed into a
[1:20:57] certain womb and were birthed.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; You can never change that.
[1:21:04] And when you think of that humanly
[1:21:06] speaking that God has made that such an
[1:21:09] irrevocable act, it can never be
[1:21:11] changed.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; You think God's going to have to change
[1:21:14] his mind about his children
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; when they've been birthed to him by his
[1:21:20] own spirit?
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; I can tell you what, friends, that's
[1:21:23] what the blood and all of all the
[1:21:26] mysteries concerning blood and the
[1:21:28] shedding of blood at Calvary, that's
[1:21:31] what it was all about. But I want to
[1:21:33] quickly say to you, think of it now.
[1:21:36] Before it was blood, it was word.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Before it was blood. In other words, let
[1:21:48] me just put it to you this way.
[1:21:51] Think of think of blood because blood is
[1:21:53] a unifying force. Think of it as being
[1:21:56] in different forms.
[1:21:59] At one time
[1:22:02] when the children of Israel or the
[1:22:04] Hebrews were enslaved in Egypt and God
[1:22:08] had already promised to Abraham, I'm
[1:22:10] going to deliver your seed out
[1:22:13] of of this nation that will keep them in
[1:22:15] bondage. I'm going to deliver them.
[1:22:21] He comes to Moses,
[1:22:24] his prophet,
[1:22:26] the word of God.
[1:22:29] Let every man
[1:22:31] take a lamb to his household.
[1:22:35] That's the word.
[1:22:38] And slay the lamb.
[1:22:40] And do this with the blood and do that
[1:22:43] with the flesh.
[1:22:46] That was word.
[1:22:49] Before it happened, it was first word.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; And when God said it, it was more
[1:22:54] certain then than even when it became a
[1:22:56] physical act.
[1:22:59] Are you with me?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; It was first word, then it became an
[1:23:03] act.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was making it known to the
[1:23:12] disciples that the son of man shall
[1:23:14] suffer, the son of man shall be slain,
[1:23:17] will be killed. And they didn't want to
[1:23:19] hear that. Peter, he didn't want to hear
[1:23:22] that. And finally they're in the garden
[1:23:26] and Jesus is going through the agony of
[1:23:28] Gethsemane and soon the soldiers come
[1:23:32] with spo swords and spears and Peter
[1:23:35] takes his sword to slay Malcus strikes
[1:23:38] off his ear. Jesus says put up your
[1:23:41] sword.
[1:23:44] He tells him that this must be
[1:23:48] or else how will the scriptures be
[1:23:51] fulfilled? Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; He hadn't shed his blood, but it was
[1:23:55] still, it was word first.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; The word
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; was a unifying force before it even
[1:24:03] became physical blood. We talk about the
[1:24:05] blood of Jesus Christ. How thankful we
[1:24:08] are. It was shed. But before it was
[1:24:10] shed, it was promised to be shed.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Before it was blood, it was word. Like
[1:24:17] when brother Lance preached years ago
[1:24:19] and it was striking in the in the log
[1:24:22] church yet and he said if we had here a
[1:24:25] vial a vial of the literal blood of
[1:24:29] Jesus Christ there would be no spiritual
[1:24:33] value to it whatsoever.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; The spiritual the blood the physical
[1:24:39] blood that was shed was only evidence
[1:24:41] that it had been written. It was
[1:24:43] prophesied.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He shall be led as a lamb to
[1:24:48] the slaughter and as a shear as a as a
[1:24:50] sheep before shears are dumb. So he
[1:24:52] opened not his mouth. He's he's wounded
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; for our iniquities and by his stripes
[1:25:00] were healed.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; He's marred more than that any man. And
[1:25:05] it depicts his in incredible suffering
[1:25:08] and death. All of that was prophesied
[1:25:10] hundreds of years before he went to
[1:25:12] Calvary. So I say today before there was
[1:25:15] a Calvary it was word.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; I need to establish that very very much
[1:25:20] because now the act has been the act is
[1:25:24] in the past. First it was the word that
[1:25:27] was in the past and then and then it
[1:25:29] came into a physical reality. Now for us
[1:25:33] the physical reality is 2,000 years ago.
[1:25:36] But it's word once again.
[1:25:43] And it's a bleeding word.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; There's power
[1:25:48] within
[1:25:50] the very words of God.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Power to unify
[1:25:57] and bring a man or a woman into an
[1:26:00] absolute inseparable
[1:26:03] contact and relationship with Almighty
[1:26:06] God. more so than you are a daughter or
[1:26:10] a son of your parents. More so than
[1:26:12] that.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And I say to you today, that's
[1:26:16] absolutely an irrevocable. You cannot
[1:26:18] change that. You cannot change that. But
[1:26:21] more certain than that is that a word
[1:26:24] that God has given for this generation
[1:26:26] packs the very life blood of God. Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; When you hear thus saith the Lord,
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; I can tell you within that's that does
[1:26:37] not not just speaks volumes, but hear me
[1:26:40] today. When you hear a word, thus saith
[1:26:44] the Lord and you hear a prophetic voice
[1:26:46] in this generation, a message for this
[1:26:48] hour, I will tell you on the authority
[1:26:51] of God's word, that word is a bleeding
[1:26:53] word.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; That word has the blood cell of almighty
[1:26:57] God in it. That word has the power to
[1:27:00] bring you into sunship.
[1:27:02] [Music]
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; And there is no other seed that can do
[1:27:07] that.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:27:12] that's precisely why Satan in all of his
[1:27:15] cunning
[1:27:17] and deception
[1:27:19] would like to introduce
[1:27:21] his view as he did in Eden,
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; his doctrine, his tradition. get people
[1:27:28] all taken up with their ly
[1:27:31] and all of their titles and all of these
[1:27:34] other things because he gets them
[1:27:36] consumed with that and it's a lifeless
[1:27:39] thing.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; There's no life in it. It's a ceremony.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; It's a tradition.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; No life in it. There's no blood in it.
[1:27:49] Amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; But soon as the word of God comes,
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; I can tell you right away, they come
[1:27:58] against that word as they've always come
[1:28:00] against that word.
[1:28:04] A man heard my service last Sunday
[1:28:09] as I spoke on your house is left to you
[1:28:11] desolate.
[1:28:14] He said, "I don't know if you are aware,
[1:28:17] but there was a public prophecy
[1:28:20] that was cried out in a meeting
[1:28:25] just as brother Brandham was finished
[1:28:28] speaking, I believe, just finished
[1:28:30] speaking
[1:28:31] and he said, "You may be interested.
[1:28:33] This is the prophecy verbatim, word for
[1:28:36] word
[1:28:39] back in the 1950s.
[1:28:42] Before serpent seed was preached,
[1:28:45] before Godhead was explained,
[1:28:49] before all of that, here was the
[1:28:52] prophecy.
[1:28:57] Yay
[1:28:59] saith the Lord to this my people that my
[1:29:03] servant whom I have sent even unto thee
[1:29:07] even unto this generation he must speak
[1:29:09] boldly even as Paul to convince these
[1:29:13] that I have sent him to yay for I have
[1:29:16] sent him my servant Branham I have put
[1:29:21] my words in his mouth even as I have
[1:29:24] sent my son to die and my people
[1:29:26] rejected him. Even so have I sent my son
[1:29:29] Brham, even in this thy day. Unto thee
[1:29:34] he hath come. Yay, they have assembled
[1:29:37] together. They have met in their secret
[1:29:39] chambers. The leaders of my people have
[1:29:42] counseledled together. They have passed
[1:29:45] judgment even upon him. They have said
[1:29:48] in their secret chambers, "We shall
[1:29:51] reject him. We shall seek a fault with
[1:29:55] him. We shall find many faults with him,
[1:30:00] and we shall teach our people. We shall
[1:30:04] tell them that this also is Belub.
[1:30:08] Yay, it is not the Spirit of the Lord
[1:30:11] that has sent him. So I will judge them
[1:30:14] even by my servant Bratam, whom I have
[1:30:17] sent unto thee. For I will put my spirit
[1:30:20] in my servants. And if thou shalt if
[1:30:24] thou doest not yield do not yield to my
[1:30:27] spirit, thou shalt be broken. For if for
[1:30:31] if it shall fall upon thee, the word of
[1:30:35] the Lord shall fall upon thee, thou
[1:30:38] shalt be crushed, and thy house left
[1:30:40] unto thee dazzle. This is the rock. Yay,
[1:30:44] if thou shalt fall upon it, thou shalt
[1:30:46] be broken. But if it doth fall upon
[1:30:49] thee, it will grind thee to powder. And
[1:30:51] thus sayeth the Lord, even unto those
[1:30:54] who have assembled together, thus sayeth
[1:30:56] the Lord, unto those that have called
[1:30:58] themselves by those who have been filled
[1:31:01] with my spirit. For yay, for ye have
[1:31:04] been my people. I have blessed thee. I
[1:31:08] have anointed thee, but thou hast
[1:31:10] gathered together and hast rejected the
[1:31:13] servant of the Lord God that I have sent
[1:31:15] unto thee. and even by sending him will
[1:31:18] I judge thee, and thy house shall be
[1:31:20] desolate even to this day, and in this
[1:31:23] hour. For thou shalt call for revival,
[1:31:26] but the ear of the Lord shall not
[1:31:28] hearken unto thee. For when I did call
[1:31:31] unto thee, thou did not know me. Thou
[1:31:35] would be a strange people unto me when I
[1:31:38] would speak unto thee. Yay, thou hast
[1:31:41] become even as my people. When I stood
[1:31:43] and cast out devils, and healed the
[1:31:46] sick, and broke bread, and multiplied it
[1:31:49] in thine eyes, thou said, he is a devil.
[1:31:53] But unto him that hath an ear, let him
[1:31:56] hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[1:31:58] churches. For I will speak unto thee, I
[1:32:02] will send my servants unto thee, and
[1:32:04] they shall bless thee, and thou shalt be
[1:32:06] gathered unto me. Thou shalt be blessed
[1:32:09] mightily as thou hast never been. Cast
[1:32:14] from thee the thinking of men and the
[1:32:17] ways of man and turn unto the Lord.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Incredible. That didn't come from a
[1:32:27] message believer.
[1:32:30] That didn't come out of one of our
[1:32:33] churches.
[1:32:34] There was none
[1:32:37] that came
[1:32:38] way up in the balcony
[1:32:41] and a person who was in the meeting said
[1:32:44] there was no microphone
[1:32:46] but my recorder picked up every word.
[1:32:50] Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:32:59] I say going the extra mile.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Going to the extremities to bring forth
[1:33:07] children to himself. Amen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I can tell you I know
[1:33:13] the church
[1:33:14] as far I'm certain of the church where
[1:33:18] this prophecy was spoken.
[1:33:20] But I can tell you one thing. I can tell
[1:33:22] you one thing. The words are absolutely
[1:33:25] true. You talk about crying for revival.
[1:33:29] How they've cried for revival. And what
[1:33:32] a toboggan route. What a toboggan ride.
[1:33:35] where the church has gone from the time
[1:33:37] of this message that was spoken till
[1:33:40] today. You couldn't even recognize the
[1:33:42] two groups.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; It was certainly from the Lord
[1:33:49] up in Grand Prairie and and Brea were in
[1:33:52] those meetings. I was just uh reading
[1:33:55] some
[1:33:57] words there because we were there knew a
[1:33:59] lot of the people and I think the first
[1:34:01] person that comes to him he asks do you
[1:34:05] believe that God is here and do you
[1:34:07] believe that I am his prophet
[1:34:10] we didn't even recognize it at the time
[1:34:13] what is it what is it we say what is a
[1:34:16] word from a prophet I say before before
[1:34:20] Moses slayed the first lamb
[1:34:24] It was already slain when he spoke the
[1:34:26] word.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; When he said it, "Thou shalt take a lamb
[1:34:30] for a household. Thou shalt slay it."
[1:34:32] The blood was essentially dispensed
[1:34:34] with.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Do you think I'm off base?
[1:34:40] It was already done.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; It was already done by word.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; And then it became an act.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Before there was a Passover, before
[1:34:50] there was a Calvary,
[1:34:52] It
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; was already
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; established
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; here.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; And oh, I know we agree with that. But
[1:35:00] now I tell you, we're hundreds and
[1:35:03] hundreds of years beyond, centuries
[1:35:05] beyond and a people in a generation that
[1:35:08] has gone far. A Leodyian generation
[1:35:12] that's out there. How thankful I am for
[1:35:14] a bright age. How thankful I am that the
[1:35:17] spirit of God has called a people out of
[1:35:19] this death out here.
[1:35:22] Say, I'm rich and increased with goods
[1:35:24] and have need of nothing and knowest not
[1:35:26] that thou art wretched and naked and
[1:35:28] blind and deceived.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; That's the generation.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; How we ought to rejoice today that in
[1:35:40] this day came a true word.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; A word that's not just some do this, do
[1:35:49] that. wear your clothes this way, your
[1:35:52] hair that way, or do something else. You
[1:35:55] can't do this and you can't you can't do
[1:35:57] that, but you can do this. If that's all
[1:35:59] it is, forget it.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; This isn't a bunch of commandments.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; This is a life
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; that come from a blood cell
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; into a living being down into the soul
[1:36:13] and transforms us into new creatures in
[1:36:16] Christ Jesus. And you're no longer your
[1:36:19] old self. You're a new creature and you
[1:36:21] might be here today and need that. Some
[1:36:23] of our young people might need that.
[1:36:24] Don't stop at anything short. That's
[1:36:26] what it is.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; And that's where the blood is
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; and it's the blood that unites. You can
[1:36:33] say, "I'm a son, a daughter with God of
[1:36:36] God by his blood."
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; His word, the very word that he speaks,
[1:36:48] I won't say is more potent, but it's
[1:36:50] just as real
[1:36:53] to a believer as the substance. That's
[1:36:56] why faith is the substance of things
[1:37:00] hoped for.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; It's such a reality in in amongst
[1:37:08] children. And all of you that are
[1:37:10] parents, you know what I'm going to
[1:37:13] refer to now. When you have a child, you
[1:37:17] don't have to even put the thing in
[1:37:18] their hand. You just have to tell them
[1:37:22] that daddy's going to do this.
[1:37:25] We're going to get in the car and soon
[1:37:27] as you're done with this little bit of
[1:37:30] work, we're going to get in the car and
[1:37:32] we're going to go down and I'm you're
[1:37:34] going to have a milkshake. Going to buy
[1:37:36] you an ice cream. We're going to do
[1:37:38] something special. Oh, they get happy
[1:37:41] right away. It's just as well. They they
[1:37:44] can see that ice cream in their hand.
[1:37:46] It's just a reality. What was it? All
[1:37:49] they have is daddy's voice.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Daddy's words.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; But his words are as good as the ice
[1:37:56] cream.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; And I don't have to wait to have the ice
[1:37:59] cream to be happy. I can be happy now
[1:38:01] cuz father's not going to lie.
[1:38:05] I go to prepare a place for you
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; and where I am there you may be also
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; that brings immediate joy. You say he
[1:38:15] won't tell me a lie.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; I will be your God and you shall be my
[1:38:22] son.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; It's finished.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; How am I your son? Because you have
[1:38:29] received into your being the word. Not
[1:38:32] only the word but the bleeding word of
[1:38:35] God.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; You pack. That's why the prophet could
[1:38:38] say you pack the token.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; You have the sacrifice
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; in you. You're carrying the token with
[1:38:45] you.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have it now.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; You have the word. You received the
[1:38:51] word.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; It's a bleeding word. And the prophet
[1:38:54] said it could not happen until this
[1:38:56] generation.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; It couldn't happen like that.
[1:39:00] He talked about the uniting time,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; the uniting of the nations, the uniting
[1:39:08] of the churches that everything's
[1:39:10] uniting together. And he made this
[1:39:13] interesting statement
[1:39:17] said I want to call the text. He wants
[1:39:19] to preach on it the uniting time and
[1:39:23] sign.
[1:39:25] Then he says the uniting time sign. So
[1:39:30] that sounds kind of complicated.
[1:39:33] Uniting. See time. Uniting time. That's
[1:39:38] what it is. Now
[1:39:41] this time that we're in is a uniting
[1:39:44] time. Then he said, "And the sign of
[1:39:49] that
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; uniting time." Amen.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Now, to make that just a little bit more
[1:39:57] clear,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; I just refer you back to the
[1:40:04] three wise men.
[1:40:09] These were spiritual men.
[1:40:12] Brother Brandham says clearly,
[1:40:14] he said those
[1:40:17] those three stars
[1:40:19] that had to cross their paths. He said
[1:40:22] it was their birth path
[1:40:24] in the heavens and those three stars
[1:40:26] came and became one light. They saw the
[1:40:29] star.
[1:40:31] They followed it
[1:40:34] for a long time.
[1:40:36] said the observatories or those in those
[1:40:39] in those days they certainly studied the
[1:40:41] stars and everyone missed it.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; It didn't mean it was a sign to them.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; They were elected to see it
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; but no one else saw it.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; The observatories didn't see it. The
[1:40:56] stargazers didn't see it. The
[1:40:58] astronomers of the day, it was a great
[1:41:00] day of science.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; They didn't see it. It didn't mean
[1:41:05] anything to them, but they even knew
[1:41:08] what to ask for. Oh, I hope you see they
[1:41:11] they saw the sign. It was elected for
[1:41:15] them to see it. Listen to me, my
[1:41:18] precious friends.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; This is my last service. I would want
[1:41:22] you to understand and see this. These
[1:41:25] signs that take place now, they don't
[1:41:28] even mean anything to a lot of people or
[1:41:31] to a lot of people. Well, they're just a
[1:41:33] piece of journalism. Oh, there's this. I
[1:41:35] have it here. There's this in the
[1:41:37] newspaper. This newspaper right here,
[1:41:40] which I just got this week, makes a
[1:41:42] statement that I made last Sunday. I
[1:41:45] made my statement by the message. They
[1:41:48] make their statement by an event. Before
[1:41:50] it became an event, it was already
[1:41:52] established.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Three wise men.
[1:41:59] So they see the star and they follow and
[1:42:02] they journey.
[1:42:05] What are they being already? These three
[1:42:09] stars have combined united
[1:42:13] and they united.
[1:42:15] These wise men to the sign.
[1:42:20] They began to follow the sign. They
[1:42:23] believed in the sign. They believed in
[1:42:26] the sign. I said
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; they believed in this heavenly sign.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; They believed in it even when no one
[1:42:32] else believed in it. And when they came,
[1:42:34] they knew what they were looking for.
[1:42:36] Where is he that is born king of the
[1:42:39] Jews?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; How did that light tell them there was
[1:42:43] somebody born king of the Jews? They
[1:42:45] were elected by the God who caused those
[1:42:48] stars to come into line up into uniting.
[1:42:51] They came into a unity and they bound
[1:42:54] these men on earth to it and carried
[1:42:56] they followed the star. They followed
[1:42:58] the sign and came and that led them
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; to the Messiah.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; They were united
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; with the Messiah. They fell. They
[1:43:10] worshiped him
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; and they're recorded in the scripture.
[1:43:14] Right.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; They saw the sign
[1:43:18] didn't mean anything to a lot of other
[1:43:21] people. And today
[1:43:24] there's so many signs
[1:43:27] you and I can scarcely keep up with it.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; You know, this is the first time
[1:43:37] we've seen we've watched a lot of signs
[1:43:39] regarding Israel.
[1:43:42] And the prophet said, "If you want to
[1:43:44] see where you're at, see where the Jews
[1:43:47] are.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; See what they're doing.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; See what's happening."
[1:43:54] Our prophet declared
[1:43:57] that Rome, which been an archeneemy of
[1:44:00] Israel for years, will make a covenant
[1:44:04] with them,
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; make an alliance with them. And how I
[1:44:08] just rehearse to you how golden my ear
[1:44:12] first woman prime minister and the first
[1:44:14] prime minister of Israel to every
[1:44:17] journey to the Vatican and commence and
[1:44:20] open the door. A crack of the door
[1:44:23] appeared and they began to set up
[1:44:26] visitations back and forth and and
[1:44:30] receiving of dignitaries and finally
[1:44:34] diplomatic even ambassadorial
[1:44:37] relationship
[1:44:39] doors were opened. I have a a second uh
[1:44:42] article here where
[1:44:46] uh
[1:44:47] the Pope John Paul II
[1:44:51] is meeting and the first time in history
[1:44:54] is meeting with the Israeli and
[1:44:58] Palestinian
[1:44:59] tourism ministers, ministers of tourism,
[1:45:03] receiving them to the Vatican because
[1:45:07] you know, oh my I hope you people
[1:45:11] believers of the message take a hold of
[1:45:13] the keys and just open up those keys.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Satan is in control of the economics.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Satan is in control of the politics.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Satan's in control of this whole thing.
[1:45:25] And he now now uh it it looks so
[1:45:27] innocent. It looks so
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; uh she looks so reasonable.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Here's Israel hurting right now. Hurting
[1:45:36] because her big industry is tourism.
[1:45:40] That's her big industry and she's
[1:45:42] hurting terribly. The Palestinian
[1:45:45] people desiring to set up their state
[1:45:48] and it looks like it's moving in that
[1:45:50] direction. And they have a an old
[1:45:54] warrior
[1:45:56] who has forgot his uh
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; his convictions
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; and forgot what he fought for
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; and certainly has forgot his Torah.
[1:46:08] He's
[1:46:10] forgotten it because of the pressure
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; of economics and the pressure of keeping
[1:46:16] the state going and paying the bills
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; and their their economy is down because
[1:46:23] of tourism is down. But now the most
[1:46:26] powerful man on earth of mortal man
[1:46:35] is prepared to throw his weight and to
[1:46:38] say to the Christian world, you must
[1:46:41] increase the tourism to Israel. And both
[1:46:45] of them, both the Palestinian
[1:46:48] and the Israeli, need it desperately.
[1:46:52] And they're they're increasing to
[1:46:57] bind themselves together under that
[1:47:00] headship and under that leadership. And
[1:47:03] I have a it goes on here which I won't
[1:47:05] bother going into it now. But
[1:47:09] the ambassador
[1:47:12] of the Vatican, the ambassador to
[1:47:14] Israel, they have their ambassadors have
[1:47:17] been set up. Listen friends, that
[1:47:19] happened maybe not while you younger
[1:47:21] ones have been alive, but it happened
[1:47:23] when most of us were alive, right?
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; When most of us lived. We have gone from
[1:47:28] we have gone from zero association
[1:47:32] to not just an introduction, but now to
[1:47:36] a union
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; and a closer and closer and closer tie
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; with what a prophet said will be a
[1:47:47] covenant.
[1:47:49] That's right.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; And as I said in the last meeting and
[1:47:53] the Vatican is putting pressure on the
[1:47:55] United States, the most powerful nation
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; to put pressure on Israel to conclude
[1:48:02] with this agreement with us. We have in
[1:48:05] two letters, one which I told you I have
[1:48:07] I have a copy of and I've read and all
[1:48:10] of the all of the things that uh the
[1:48:13] Vatican is requiring concerning the
[1:48:15] properties and taxation, etc., etc. says
[1:48:18] put put pressure and here prophets
[1:48:20] already said it.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; He said that they will they will that
[1:48:24] that that that this beast that came out
[1:48:26] of the earth said which is America she
[1:48:29] will say what the beast says.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Repeat the same thing. And here he's
[1:48:35] telling her now what to say and you go
[1:48:37] and say it. And they're doing it.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Where are we at? Amen.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Now, to a lot of folks,
[1:48:47] it's a news article.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; To a lot of folks,
[1:48:52] it's a newspaper.
[1:48:57] Now, Israel
[1:49:00] through her incredible suffering was
[1:49:03] actually united to in uniting time.
[1:49:06] While a prophet of God was preaching,
[1:49:08] Israel was being united with her land.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; And he said, "It's uniting time." But he
[1:49:16] also told us that there'd be a time they
[1:49:19] would break this covenant. And the and
[1:49:21] the bride, the bride of Jesus Christ, he
[1:49:25] says, is gone. Now listen, friends, any
[1:49:28] man that could stand there and tell a
[1:49:30] person, you're a doctor
[1:49:32] or you're Mrs. leads and this is where
[1:49:35] you live. You live at 3765
[1:49:38] certain street at a certain place. And
[1:49:41] this boy in in Grand Prairie, the first
[1:49:43] first person that came up, he turned his
[1:49:45] back and told him exactly what he was
[1:49:49] standing there for and the secret of his
[1:49:52] heart. And the next person and who
[1:49:54] they're praying for, I say, "That's the
[1:49:56] kind of voice I can believe."
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of voice I can believe.
[1:50:03] And that's the kind of voice I have to
[1:50:05] say. No man can do that.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; And I've sat on the platform and heard
[1:50:10] that I'm very responsible because I
[1:50:13] heard it. I saw it. And I can tell you
[1:50:15] even as I said in prayer this morning,
[1:50:17] God, that was you.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; No man can do that. That was you. And
[1:50:23] what you say, I believe.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something else
[1:50:30] just in case you're missing it. that
[1:50:33] when you take it into the innermost
[1:50:36] being, your soul, it's a blood act.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; It's a blood force
[1:50:48] because God back in some eternity
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; back there devised in his mind, it will
[1:50:56] be blood. Blood will be the substance
[1:51:01] that will testify of a covenant and a
[1:51:04] union.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; And when a man and a woman come together
[1:51:08] in the intimacy of marriage, it will
[1:51:11] essentially be blood.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Not do you want a baby, do you want a
[1:51:15] boy, do you want a girl, it'll be blood.
[1:51:18] Yeah.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; And Satan in a garden inspiring and
[1:51:22] using the serpent as a tool took and
[1:51:25] passed blood scene. And the prophet said
[1:51:28] it was the only seed that would mingle.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; And God cursed him out of existence.
[1:51:33] He's a missing link. He's gone.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Cast down to his belly.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[1:51:42] life.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me? It was a blood
[1:51:47] sin.
[1:51:49] And so Jesus had to shed blood and it
[1:51:52] was the newly created blood of almighty
[1:51:55] God. But oh, when that cell was broken,
[1:51:59] but we talk about redemption by blood.
[1:52:03] I'd like to make something clear. I'm
[1:52:04] not going to be just a few minutes
[1:52:06] longer, but I'd like to make something
[1:52:08] clear. We talk about and sing about. We
[1:52:10] have a lovely song. I believe sister
[1:52:12] Leslie Anne has sung it for us and
[1:52:14] others in the congregation. Redemption
[1:52:17] by blood.
[1:52:19] But fellowship by blood is a different
[1:52:22] thing.
[1:52:24] Fellowship can only come and I'm not
[1:52:26] talking about the kind of fellowship you
[1:52:27] shake your hand say God bless you my
[1:52:29] brother my sister. That's not the
[1:52:30] fellowship I'm talking about. I'm
[1:52:32] talking about fellowship that is so
[1:52:34] intimate. It is according to the even
[1:52:36] according to the depths of the Greek and
[1:52:38] the Hebrew and especially the Greek and
[1:52:40] the fellowship even comes to an intimacy
[1:52:43] and they use the word intercourse. It is
[1:52:45] a fellowship. It is a union. It is where
[1:52:49] God unites with his child.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; And thus the the terminology children of
[1:52:55] God doesn't appear in the Old Testament
[1:52:58] because it wasn't known in the Old
[1:53:00] Testament. It could only be known in the
[1:53:02] New Testament when the blood of Jesus
[1:53:04] Christ, the blood cell was broken and
[1:53:07] the spirit from that blood cell would
[1:53:09] come down into a believing heart and
[1:53:12] they would be birthed again by the blood
[1:53:14] of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; You have to excuse me. I get I'm getting
[1:53:21] very very exercised over this. I hope
[1:53:23] you get it.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; And then that is fellowship.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:32] The redeem. To redeem means to pay the
[1:53:35] price.
[1:53:37] That's what it means to redeem. To
[1:53:39] redeem means that one is purchased and
[1:53:44] saved from the penalty
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; of their sin or whatever more. You're
[1:53:50] saved by redemption. But fellowship is
[1:53:53] something else. Fellowship comes as a
[1:53:56] result of redemption.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:02] So God
[1:54:03] spoke the word,
[1:54:06] made redemption, but in his mind it was
[1:54:09] a bleeding word.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Every household,
[1:54:14] every man
[1:54:17] will slay a lamb
[1:54:23] for their household.
[1:54:25] the mind of God.
[1:54:28] He saw blood being shed. Tell you a lot
[1:54:30] of people have a difficulty with the Old
[1:54:31] Testament because there was such such
[1:54:34] bloodshed.
[1:54:36] Animals were slain by the thousands. It
[1:54:39] put a question in anybody's mind. Why?
[1:54:41] Why would this need to be? Why would
[1:54:44] these lovely animals and calves and
[1:54:46] sheep and lambs as loving as they are?
[1:54:48] Why would they have to die? Thousands of
[1:54:50] them. Thousands of them and burn out.
[1:54:52] What kind of a god does this people ask
[1:54:54] that has to have this kind of incense in
[1:54:56] his nostrils coming from from the
[1:54:59] shedding of the life of multitudes?
[1:55:02] You never understand that,
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; But you understand it if you realize
[1:55:08] back in the mind of God, there'll be
[1:55:10] blood.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Blood will be the force. Blood will be
[1:55:14] the uniting force. And when his arc
[1:55:16] enemy came and broke that thing, God
[1:55:19] determined he's going to bring them back
[1:55:20] again. He's going to unite them to him
[1:55:23] again. He's going to reunite them
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; and then bring them into fellowship.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; And as I said, fellowship is not
[1:55:36] sufficiently
[1:55:38] into communion.
[1:55:40] And the same word of fellowship
[1:55:44] quania
[1:55:45] is communion.
[1:55:49] Intimacy of communion.
[1:55:54] And that's what God
[1:55:58] was looking for. in uh
[1:56:03] in God's God's servant Job this message,
[1:56:09] Brother Brandham said, "And before Adam
[1:56:11] could ever approach back in to
[1:56:14] fellowship with the father, God had to
[1:56:18] slay an innocent lamb or sheep and make
[1:56:21] him a cloth to go around him and throw
[1:56:24] out the welcome carpet for Adam." See
[1:56:28] how this is worded? Throw out the
[1:56:31] welcome carpet for Adam to walk back on
[1:56:35] the carpet of redemption.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Powerful.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; So he could walk back
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; on the carpet of redemption. A bleeding
[1:56:45] animal hide.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; There's no salvation in an animal hide.
[1:56:49] But it wasn't salvation in the animal
[1:56:50] hide. It was salvation in the word of
[1:56:52] God that spoke it before it happened.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; That's where the salvation was. And
[1:56:57] people under Moses slew the Passover
[1:57:02] lamb by the thousands. Hear me
[1:57:05] believers.
[1:57:07] And died
[1:57:10] in the wilderness.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Even though they did the physical aspect
[1:57:17] and shed the physical blood, they didn't
[1:57:20] believe the word.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; They didn't believe the word. But when
[1:57:27] you believe the word, you've got the
[1:57:29] blood. When you believe the word, you've
[1:57:31] got Calvary. When you believe the word,
[1:57:34] you've got Christ. You've got the
[1:57:35] Passover. You've got the token. You've
[1:57:37] got everything when you believe the
[1:57:39] word.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; But if you doubt it, you have nothing.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; If you doubt it, you can come to church.
[1:57:45] You can boohoo. You can repent. You can
[1:57:47] do everything you want. But if you doubt
[1:57:49] the word, you have none of it.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; But if you believe the word, you have
[1:57:53] all of it.
[1:57:55] Hallelujah.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; That's my message to you today.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; That we will be brought into fellowship
[1:58:06] by the blood.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Said blood was the way back to
[1:58:15] fellowship. When I say blood, I don't
[1:58:18] want you thinking
[1:58:20] necessarily of Calvary 2,000 years ago.
[1:58:24] I want you to think of that one. He was
[1:58:27] at Calvary because he was first the
[1:58:30] word.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; And after Calvary, he is the word again.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; You can't believe you can't dis disallow
[1:58:38] or disbelieve the word now and have the
[1:58:41] benefits of Calvary back there
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; by believing today on the bleeding word.
[1:58:47] You have the benefits of Calvary.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:56] My last thought and I close.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Here's a depth of fellowship. Now,
[1:59:05] communion. What do we do at communion?
[1:59:09] What do you do at communion?
[1:59:13] We take one loaf
[1:59:16] and we break that loaf.
[1:59:20] a lot of real intimate communion
[1:59:25] with one another. We become
[1:59:29] often eat because eating of the
[1:59:31] sacrifice
[1:59:33] is a definite part of communion. So we
[1:59:35] take the bread and break the bread here
[1:59:40] and they take the cup which comes out of
[1:59:42] one cup and it's poured into many
[1:59:44] because of the number of our people. We
[1:59:48] used to all have just one cup which now
[1:59:50] it's not possible. But out of that one
[1:59:52] cup is poured into the cups.
[1:59:56] And one bread now is into all of you. A
[2:00:01] piece of that bread. From that one bread
[2:00:04] is into all of you.
[2:00:07] And part of the cup goes into all of us.
[2:00:11] It becomes inseparable because it
[2:00:13] becomes part of our system.
[2:00:16] It goes into our very being
[2:00:20] and it's into one being it's into the
[2:00:22] other one
[2:00:24] and we have made a outward declaration.
[2:00:27] It is not some act of of the Holy
[2:00:30] Eucharist or just some communion but we
[2:00:33] with a revelation of the act you're
[2:00:35] saying I'm a part of Christ. I'm a part
[2:00:37] of Christ. I'm a part I'm a cell. You're
[2:00:39] a cell.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; She's a cell. He's a cell. And we are
[2:00:43] sons and daughters of God of one family
[2:00:46] by this bread.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; And we are one loaf.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; And it goes just a wee bit deeper
[2:00:54] on a number of occasions. And I'm so
[2:00:56] glad
[2:00:58] brother Brandham said it this way. He
[2:01:01] says that the cross,
[2:01:04] he got up on his altar. Cross
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; calls it his altar. Cross.
[2:01:11] his altar cross. Isaac who was a type of
[2:01:16] Christ was taken by Abraham on a mount
[2:01:20] Mariah which is a mount of all the
[2:01:22] dispute now and uh the Muslim people
[2:01:26] have identified the rock that he was
[2:01:27] laid on to be offered. Ah the prophet
[2:01:30] describes he climbed up on his rock. He
[2:01:33] carried his wood as Christ carried his
[2:01:35] cross. He climbed up on his altar as
[2:01:38] Christ a willing not a not a rebellious
[2:01:43] not saying I don't want to die he was a
[2:01:45] perfect type of Christ and he crawled up
[2:01:48] on his altar and there God delivered him
[2:01:50] from it Jesus willingly he said to
[2:01:54] Pilate no man takes my life from me I
[2:01:58] lay it down and I will take it up again
[2:02:01] and he laid down on his altar and was
[2:02:03] raised up between heaven and earth on
[2:02:06] his altar. But the Apostle Paul says,
[2:02:09] "Those that eat of the sacrifice, he was
[2:02:12] the sacrifice, are they not partakers of
[2:02:16] the altar?"
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; When we partake of his body and drink of
[2:02:23] his blood, we are partakers of his
[2:02:26] death.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; And we died in him
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; so we won't have to die again.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We died in him, so we live
[2:02:37] in him.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; We are partakers in our communion. And
[2:02:43] the next time you have it, wherever you
[2:02:45] have it, when you take your bread and
[2:02:48] take the wine, I want you to say to
[2:02:51] yourself, I am now a partaker of the
[2:02:55] cross of Christ. I am a participant in
[2:02:59] its shame. I'm a participant in its
[2:03:01] reproach, but I'm also a participant in
[2:03:04] the fact that it is finished. The price
[2:03:07] has been paid and I am free from my sin.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; You become a partaker.
[2:03:18] And even though you say, "Well, is there
[2:03:20] only emblems?" Let it be known to you
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; that you're not that there's no value in
[2:03:25] the emblem itself. The value is in the
[2:03:28] word you believe. Amen.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; And because you believe the bleeding
[2:03:32] word, you have the benefits of Calvary.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; I could have the very blood of Jesus
[2:03:38] Christ and sprinkle it here, sprinkle it
[2:03:40] on you, and it wouldn't do anything. It
[2:03:42] is what you believe concerning it.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; And we believe.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; We believe. Only believe. All things are
[2:03:49] possible. Only believe. God bless the
[2:03:52] congregation. God bless the people
[2:03:54] wherever they are in whatever land
[2:03:56] around the world where they are just
[2:03:58] now. I'm so thankful we have fellowship.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; I mean communion. I'm talking about a
[2:04:04] union that's closer. You might be here
[2:04:06] with your husband or wife or your loved
[2:04:08] ones or your children or whatever more.
[2:04:10] I'm talking about a union that goes far
[2:04:12] beyond that one.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; It was a little quiet then.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; I trust you know that your union
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; with God has gone far beyond any human
[2:04:27] relationship.
[2:04:28] This is not a human relationship we have
[2:04:30] with almighty God through Jesus Christ.
[2:04:34] We have a supernatural
[2:04:36] relationship. It's not something you
[2:04:38] know pie in the sky, some imaginary.
[2:04:42] It's a reality.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; This may really throw you. The musicians
[2:04:53] can come. This may really throw you.
[2:04:59] Prophet said the uniting
[2:05:03] time.
[2:05:06] This is the uniting time and the sign of
[2:05:11] that time.
[2:05:12] Now we have a prophet sign, but he
[2:05:15] happened to give us a whole lot of other
[2:05:17] signs.
[2:05:19] Listen real close now. You might read it
[2:05:22] in your newspaper. You might hear it on
[2:05:24] the radio. You might hear it from
[2:05:26] someone else.
[2:05:28] You might hear it preached and say, "Oh
[2:05:30] my, yes, that is actually happening
[2:05:33] right now." You wouldn't know that.
[2:05:38] You wouldn't know that unless a thus
[2:05:41] sayeth the Lord word had already come.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; You have a message that has told you
[2:05:47] that.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; And now when you hear it and you see the
[2:05:51] event, you've always believed it. You
[2:05:54] believed it because you're a believer.
[2:05:56] You're elected to be a believer. And so
[2:05:58] when you see the event, the sign, the
[2:06:01] sign is actually drawing you into the
[2:06:04] act. Just like the just like the uh uh
[2:06:07] the the three wise men, excuse me for
[2:06:09] taking this extra moment, but the three
[2:06:11] wise men, they came in and they talked
[2:06:13] to the authorities. Where is he? They
[2:06:16] didn't know, but you we'll inquire. Oh,
[2:06:18] he's supposed to be in Bethlehem. All
[2:06:19] right. So, they're making their way.
[2:06:21] They're they're not saying, "Oh, I I
[2:06:23] guess we missed it. He's not here.
[2:06:25] Surely he should have been here in
[2:06:26] Jerusalem. We missed it." No, they kept
[2:06:28] pursuing. They kept going on. We know
[2:06:31] that the sign is true.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; And we saw the sign, and we know what it
[2:06:36] means.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; We haven't seen the event yet, but we
[2:06:39] know that the sign is correct.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We know the sign is
[2:06:46] right.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; And the man saw a lot of different
[2:06:50] signs. They kept looking, following the
[2:06:52] star, making the journey. We're
[2:06:53] journeying through life. We're going to
[2:06:55] work. We're hearing something. We hear
[2:06:57] something. We hear it preached. I heard
[2:06:59] a brother preach it. Oh my goodness.
[2:07:01] There it is right there. Do we keep
[2:07:02] following it and the sign be confirmed?
[2:07:04] I'll tell you what. You've got the blood
[2:07:06] of the testimony in you.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; That is the evidence that you are united
[2:07:14] as a son and daughter with God. It's a
[2:07:17] blood union.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. because you're able to recognize
[2:07:21] the sign.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean anything to anyone else.
[2:07:25] Someone else says, "Ah, nonsense."
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; That's just a tourist, a minister of
[2:07:30] tourism going to the Vatican. What's
[2:07:31] that mean? Well, it means something to
[2:07:33] someone else.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; It's a news event to someone else, but
[2:07:37] to us say this part of the sign. Part of
[2:07:40] the sign. I had a prophet said, "Watch
[2:07:43] and see where they are
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; and then you'll know what time it is.
[2:07:49] Hallelujah. And we keep watching and
[2:07:51] seeing where they are. And it tells us
[2:07:54] the time that we're in.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; And God our father looks on that and
[2:08:01] says, "Blessed
[2:08:03] children,
[2:08:05] they believe what I speak."
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; They believe what I've said.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; You are children of a blood covenant.
[2:08:14] Amen.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; For the very life that was in the blood
[2:08:18] of Jesus Christ is in my word and you
[2:08:20] believed it.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't it wonderful?
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; I might be a fanatic, but I'm it feels
[2:08:32] good. Anyway,
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; why don't we stand? I'd like to sing
[2:08:40] uh verse or two of the song. It's number
[2:08:43] 20 22:15.
[2:08:45] I thought we just had to sing redeemed.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Redeemed. Not only redeemed, but how I
[2:08:51] love to proclaim it.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Not a
[2:08:56] historical
[2:08:57] thing. Not just historical. The your
[2:09:01] faith today declares you believe in that
[2:09:04] back there.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Will you lend your voice
[2:09:09] with me?
[2:09:10] [Music]
[2:09:13] Redeem God.
[2:09:18] Redeem my
[2:09:21] lamb.
[2:09:23] Redeemer
[2:09:26] [Applause]
[2:09:29] forever. I am
[2:09:32] [Music]
[2:09:37] free by
[2:09:40] [Applause]
[2:09:40] [Music]
[2:09:49] his child forever. I am
[2:09:55] redeemed and so happy in Jesus
[2:10:00] your
[2:10:01] [Applause]
[2:10:03] [Music]
[2:10:05] I
[2:10:07] presume
[2:10:10] [Music]
[2:10:31] his child forever.
[2:10:35] I am now I'd like to sing the fourth
[2:10:38] verse last verse I know I shall sing in
[2:10:41] his beauty we just had a or the some of
[2:10:44] the musicians and songwriters had a a
[2:10:47] meeting about songwriting says some of
[2:10:48] the me some of the songs need to be
[2:10:50] updated this is one of them
[2:10:53] I know I shall see see in his beauty I
[2:10:57] would suggest we sing I know I see him
[2:11:02] in his beauty
[2:11:05] I see him now, friends.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; I know. I see him beauty,
[2:11:18] the king in whom I delight,
[2:11:23] who lovingly pardoned my footsteps
[2:11:28] and given me something in the night.
[2:11:33] Redee,
[2:11:35] redeemed,
[2:11:37] redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[2:11:42] Redee,
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:46] redeemed,
[2:11:50] his child and forever. I am once again
[2:11:56] redeemed.
[2:11:59] redeemed.
[2:12:01] Redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[2:12:07] Redee
[2:12:08] [Music]
[2:12:15] is child and forever. I am.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; How lovely you are Lord Jesus.
[2:12:28] When I think when we think collectively
[2:12:33] the king in all of his beauty and glory,
[2:12:38] oh Lord, in one day even the veil of
[2:12:41] this flesh
[2:12:43] will drop and we will rise to seize the
[2:12:46] everlasting price. We will rise, oh God,
[2:12:50] and escape
[2:12:52] this natural
[2:12:55] mortal life. And there will be another
[2:12:57] great uniting.
[2:13:00] For the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[2:13:03] Then we which are alive and remain shall
[2:13:05] be caught up together
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; with them. Oh Lord.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. What a hope. What a promise.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; And it's true.
[2:13:17] Absolute truth. Our confidence is in
[2:13:21] what you said, not in what we see, not
[2:13:24] in what we feel, but our confidence is
[2:13:27] in what you said. And so we say with
[2:13:30] David, unite our hearts to fear thy
[2:13:36] name, to reverence what you have spoken,
[2:13:39] what you've said. causes. I pray Lord
[2:13:41] that there be a new grip that will be
[2:13:44] taken by the people upon the word that
[2:13:48] you have sent us upon the message of the
[2:13:51] hour for it will do them only good. It
[2:13:56] will draw them. It will be a drawing
[2:13:58] force in their lives. Oh God, I thank
[2:14:02] you for your presence. Thank you for
[2:14:04] your nearness now. And hear us, Lord, as
[2:14:08] we declare
[2:14:11] our love and testify of our sincere
[2:14:15] devotion to you in the name of Jesus
[2:14:19] Christ.
[2:14:21] And before we shake hands and depart
[2:14:24] from one another, let's sing our anthem.
[2:14:28] I love him. I love him because he first
[2:14:33] loved me. Don't let it become just words
[2:14:36] to you, but let it emanate from your
[2:14:38] heart. Now,
[2:14:40] [Music]
[2:14:45] we love you, Lord Jesus.
[2:14:50] I love him.
[2:14:55] He calls
[2:14:58] me.
[2:15:01] [Music]
[2:15:05] Always thank you Lord and
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:14] my
[2:15:16] salary.
