[25:08] Yola Novakowski are having a little one
[25:10] dedicated. And as they uh, says,
[25:12] "Brother Biscll comes, let's sing
[25:13] together. Jesus loves me. This I know.
[25:17] For the Bible tells me so.
[25:22] Jesus loves me. This I know.
[25:28] For the Bible

[25:36] [Music]

[25:57] Jesus loves me.

[26:04] The second verse. So Jesus loves me. He
[26:09] who died.
[26:12] Heaven's gates to open wide.

[26:22] When you little child,
[26:28] Jesus
[26:30] loves me. Oh yes,
[26:33] Jesus loves me.
[26:37] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[26:42] The Bible tells Sing force again. Oh
[26:47] yes, Jesus loves me.
[26:52] Yes, Jesus
[26:54] loves me.
[26:58] Jesus loves me.
[27:07] Well, that should put a smile on
[27:09] anybody's heart and life and mouth and
[27:11] face.
[27:13] Jesus loves us. If he hadn't, we we
[27:17] wouldn't be here, would we? And now we
[27:20] have uh Brother Craig and Sister Yola
[27:23] Novakowski.
[27:25] And they're not their latest edition,
[27:27] their first edition. There's always
[27:29] something special about the first
[27:31] edition, isn't it?
[27:33] Uh I was uh I was thinking about how
[27:38] brother Greg and Sister Yola
[27:41] uh I I heard brother Greg, he went back
[27:44] to Poland to find a wife. Of course, I
[27:48] don't know any other details too much,
[27:49] but he'd already been communicating with
[27:51] her. And uh the way things happen is
[27:55] just so so miraculous. you know, she's
[27:58] in Germany and he's going back to Poland
[28:01] and I don't I don't know what's
[28:03] happening. I just kind of took my hands
[28:05] off of the thing. And here Greg goes
[28:08] over and finds Yola. I mean, that's a
[28:11] And her daddy's a pastor
[28:14] uh of a work over there and and Yola's
[28:18] mom and father are here today. And I
[28:21] thought that is just lovely. Uh so the
[28:23] grandparents of this little one they
[28:26] have and I wonder if we could have uh
[28:29] Yola's mother and father stand and uh
[28:32] brother Greg's mother and father stand
[28:34] as well if we could please. So,
[28:45] it's our brother Wesley and sister Anna
[28:48] Kupka and uh they will be flying out on
[28:52] Thursday. God bless you. Thank you. It's
[28:55] been so nice to have brother Andrew and
[28:58] sister Dorothia
[29:00] and Novakowski and to raise young people
[29:04] like this.
[29:06] Uh
[29:09] to to you, Brother Greg and Sister Yola.
[29:14] Uh I was thinking when I was thinking I
[29:16] wasn't trying to be humorous about Greg
[29:19] going to Poland and finding a bride. Uh
[29:22] there's been stranger things in the
[29:24] Bible, but it's pretty close to some of
[29:26] them.
[29:30] And uh I think you did real real well.
[29:33] Did real real well. You found a real
[29:34] jewel and we're very proud that you're
[29:38] here. But brother Brandham said this. He
[29:41] said
[29:42] uh regarding
[29:45] uh how how uh we have children and how
[29:49] you and I came here because each one of
[29:52] us
[29:54] are a child of somebody. And God spoke
[29:58] to us and he said like a man that is
[30:01] building chimes or making chimes
[30:05] the molder. I'm glad we have a molder.
[30:09] Not just a father and a mother, but a
[30:12] moulder
[30:14] behind them directing things.
[30:17] And uh each bell has got a different
[30:21] ring from the other one. And the same
[30:24] materials, but so much iron and so much
[30:27] steel and so much brass to make it and
[30:32] give the right thing.
[30:34] And he says, "And that's the way God
[30:36] did. He bred this one to that one and
[30:40] this one to that one and this one to
[30:44] that one until he got what he wanted.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; And I thought of who guided, you know,
[30:52] brother Greg to go far far away and
[30:55] guided sister Yola's life here and there
[30:57] and different events in their life. But
[31:00] it was the molder
[31:03] &gt;&gt; wanting to get just exactly so much of
[31:05] this and so much of that and so much of
[31:07] this and so much of that and bring forth
[31:10] one.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; And they've called this one Yan Isak and
[31:15] Yan is the precious. God is gracious and
[31:20] uh Isak he laughs or laughter joy.
[31:25] And I thought of how God the moulder has
[31:28] brought just so much all down through
[31:30] the centuries until this one. Yan will
[31:34] come on the scene and give the right
[31:36] sound.
[31:40] I never heard a grandpa grandpa like
[31:43] Andrew Novakowski said the other night.
[31:46] He said, "This boy, he has the most
[31:50] wonderful voice."
[31:54] How old is he?
[31:55] &gt;&gt; One month.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; One month.
[31:59] So, this grandfather discovered that and
[32:02] I pretty well know. I've had some
[32:03] children. I know what they do in the
[32:05] first month. And I said, I've never
[32:06] heard a grandpa yet find it was so
[32:09] wonderful to hear a voice in the first
[32:11] month. But anyway, we'll take it because
[32:13] all grandfathers
[32:15] uh believe that, I guess. But that's the
[32:18] first time I heard it confessed.
[32:21] But I am asking and going to dedicate
[32:24] Yan Isak. I'm going to ask that if the
[32:27] Lord Jesus carries and he comes of age
[32:30] that he will give the right ring
[32:33] in the high family and in the house of
[32:35] God, it'll be the right ring because God
[32:38] has brought together just so much of
[32:43] each characteristic. and I pray he will
[32:47] have a terrific voice
[32:49] we can do with them. And they brought
[32:51] the young children and Jesus took them
[32:53] up in his arms. I'm a poor substitute
[32:55] for him, but I'm going to take little
[32:59] Yan Isac and dedicate them to the Lord
[33:02] Jesus Christ.
[33:05] Heavenly Father, I hold this jewel, this
[33:08] prize, this gift that you have given to
[33:12] our brother Greg and sister Yola and to
[33:15] their parents also how they would
[33:17] treasure him. And I pray, Father, as the
[33:20] Holy Spirit watches over him, that you
[33:22] will give mother and father wisdom, that
[33:25] they will be guided, instruct him, train
[33:28] him up in the way that he should go, and
[33:31] when he grows up, he shall not depart
[33:33] from it. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[33:35] Christ, I pray that you'll protect him
[33:37] and watch over him. And I ask that he
[33:40] will indeed be a joy in the family and
[33:42] an a joy and and an example to his
[33:46] peers, Lord Jesus. And I pray that when
[33:49] he comes of age, he will know the name
[33:52] of Jesus Christ and the purpose of your
[33:54] life here on earth. I ask, oh God, you
[33:57] will use him and make him a blessing in
[33:59] the house of God as well. I pray father
[34:02] you will give him a voice that he will
[34:05] bring a joy to others and laughter
[34:08] father and uh may he have a spirit on
[34:11] him the holy spirit that will bring such
[34:13] comfort and joy to those that he's
[34:15] around keep him in good health I pray
[34:18] that you'll give sister yola wisdom Lord
[34:20] in the home and brother Greg oh God to
[34:23] guide his footsteps may he set an
[34:26] example for him in the name of Jesus
[34:29] Christ as you have given him to them.
[34:32] They now stand here and dedicate him
[34:36] back to you. We give him to you in the
[34:38] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[34:43] God bless you, Sister Noah.
[34:48] God bless you, Greg. Amen. God bless
[34:50] you.
[34:53] Hallelujah.
[34:55] Well, we stand here today with a great
[34:58] deal of joy in our hearts for the
[35:00] ministry also that has gone out from the
[35:03] church today. There's so many that are
[35:05] out ministering and brother Dier's in
[35:08] Phoenix. Brother John Andes will be
[35:10] taking his place in Seattle this
[35:12] afternoon.
[35:14] Brother brother Murphy is still
[35:16] overseas. He's uh finishing his last
[35:19] service now in in Switzerland. Uh
[35:23] they're actually having the meeting this
[35:25] afternoon. Brother Frasi Pakar's church.
[35:28] They had it last night in brother uh
[35:30] Jeanjac's church. You remember we prayed
[35:33] for brother Jeanjac. Isn't it marvelous?
[35:35] A man that was right. Just within the
[35:38] clutches of death, unconscious
[35:42] uh menitis in the brain. We talked to a
[35:45] nurse. We talked to a nurse over there
[35:47] that's actually relative. And they said
[35:49] that that that menitis and the fluid
[35:52] that was around his brain, it's it's
[35:55] absolutely impossible for it to
[35:58] dissipate within the system. Uh that
[36:00] that type of uh fluid that is has got
[36:04] menitis in it and he was completely
[36:07] unconscious and was that way for some
[36:09] time and God brought him from the doors
[36:12] of death. He and he stands today
[36:15] actually is has done some ministry
[36:17] gaining in his uh gaining in his
[36:19] strength. Nothing. If he was here today,
[36:22] you wouldn't you wouldn't even know that
[36:23] he even had that. You wouldn't even know
[36:26] that he was laying at death's door
[36:27] unconscious. You wouldn't know that. And
[36:30] so we're rejoicing. Brother Murphy had
[36:34] uh a meeting there. And then they're
[36:38] having uh communion Lord's table also
[36:40] after he preaches today in at brother
[36:44] France's church. And what God is doing
[36:47] is really really remarkable. Uh brother
[36:51] Murphy I emailed him and I said if you
[36:53] could just send me a note back and let
[36:56] me know how the meetings are going
[36:58] because they've had a very heavy
[37:00] schedule for him. He was at brother Gear
[37:02] Rudol's on Pentecost Sunday which was
[37:04] last I meant Monday last Monday and on
[37:07] Tuesday they uh he went to East Germany
[37:11] and had and had meeting there brought
[37:13] him back Wednesday and then Wednesday
[37:15] night he preached and I think Thursday
[37:18] went down to Switzerland and had service
[37:20] either Friday or Saturday at least
[37:22] Saturday and Sunday and uh he said that
[37:26] he was so so caught in the spirit of the
[37:29] meeting that He he he just was lost and
[37:34] after after speaking he had to sit down
[37:36] and said you know what has happened and
[37:40] uh God can take you know that God can
[37:42] take control of a person
[37:44] &gt;&gt; and so they had announced that he would
[37:46] give report and have the slides of China
[37:49] which are so so gripping and he had his
[37:53] computer there and he's he's he's
[37:56] preaching and he got caught in the
[37:58] spirit and uh and He he went to, you
[38:01] know, to begin to show the slides cuz it
[38:03] had even been announced. And he said it
[38:05] was like God said to him, "Don't you
[38:07] touch that button." And so he just kept
[38:10] preaching. And every time he tried to
[38:12] touch that button to start the slides
[38:14] and they never did show them, just uh
[38:17] caught in uh God, you know, God's God
[38:21] &gt;&gt; and he can just decide what what he
[38:23] wants in a meeting and he knows exactly
[38:25] what he wants. I want what he wants this
[38:27] morning. I'm not interested in anyone
[38:30] else re myself or anyone. We just want
[38:32] what God wants.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; We have needs. Amen. We have needs both
[38:38] in the congregation, outside of the
[38:39] congregation. We have our brother, see
[38:42] sister Sally Powell there, and I think
[38:44] of brother Edwin Dods. Uh we think of
[38:47] brother Tony and Rebecca also in
[38:49] Lebanon. We we are just thankful for not
[38:53] only the ministry that goes out, but
[38:54] we're thankful that we have a God that
[38:56] knows exactly what our need is.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. My Jesus knows
[39:04] &gt;&gt; just what I need. Amen. Why don't you
[39:07] stand with me?
[39:13] And I wonder if we could sing that,
[39:15] Brother Rod. My Jesus knows just what I
[39:18] need. And I'd like you to make that
[39:20] personal. Would you do that, please? If
[39:23] you'll make it personal, I'll make it
[39:25] personal. He knows just what I need. And
[39:29] then we pray, "Father,
[39:32] even we being mortals know how to give
[39:35] good gifts to our children, to our loved
[39:37] ones. How much more?
[39:40] How much more? With so much perfect
[39:42] wisdom, you'll give just what we need."
[39:46] How many here want him to do that?
[39:51] [Music]
[39:55] &gt;&gt; My Jesus knows
[39:59] just what
[40:01] I need.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he knows. He knows just what
[40:11] I need.
[40:16] be satisfied
[40:21] every
[40:24] supplies.
[40:26] Yes, he knows
[40:29] just what I need.
[40:35] My Jesus knows
[40:38] just what I need.
[40:44] Oh yes, he knows
[40:48] just what what I need.
[40:53] He's satisfied.
[40:58] And everyone
[41:00] [Music]
[41:06] just what I need.
[41:12] And I wonder for me if we could sing
[41:14] together, blessed assurance, the first
[41:18] verse, Jesus is mine. Oh, what a
[41:20] foretaste of glory divine air of
[41:23] salvation and purchase of God. This is
[41:26] my story.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; This is my song. I I'd like you just to
[41:31] bring your thoughts into captivity today
[41:34] and say, "Oh, Holy Spirit, take control
[41:36] of me." Amen. That's what we have need
[41:39] of.
[41:41] Bring my spirit into control of the Holy
[41:44] Spirit.
[41:46] And then we're going to turn to the
[41:47] word. And before we do, I'd like to also
[41:49] announce not next Sunday, but the
[41:52] following Sunday, June the 21st, we'll
[41:54] also be having the Lord's table
[41:57] communion, footwashing on June the 21st.
[42:01] So just mark that on your calendar if
[42:03] you would, please. All right. Let's just
[42:05] sing this verse for me, brother.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Bless
[42:13] Jesus
[42:15] Christ.
[42:19] Oh,
[42:23] our glory
[42:25] divine
[42:29] of salvation
[42:33] and is the God
[42:39] of his
[42:43] wash in his blood.
[42:48] This is my story.
[42:53] This is my song.
[42:58] Praising my
[43:08] This is my story.
[43:11] [Music]
[43:13] This is my song.
[43:17] Praising myior.
[43:22] [Music]
[43:29] Heavenly Father,
[43:31] we stand before you and we believe we're
[43:35] standing on holy ground.
[43:38] And we know that there are angels all
[43:41] around. And we know that Christ is here.
[43:44] We know that the presence of God by the
[43:47] Holy Spirit is here. And you're here,
[43:50] Lord, not to be idol, but to bless,
[43:53] to provide and prove yourself as Jehovah
[43:57] Gyra. Take human lips now, Lord, and
[44:00] speak words, utter things by the Holy
[44:04] Spirit, penetrating words, I pray, oh
[44:07] God, that will come and sink down into
[44:10] the deepest parts of our soul and our
[44:12] being. I pray you'll anoint, Lord, both
[44:15] speaker and the hearers in the name of
[44:18] Jesus Christ and for your glory and your
[44:20] glory alone. Amen. Amen.
[44:25] I'm going to read from 2 Corinthians the
[44:29] 4th chapter
[44:30] and uh verse 17 and 18.
[44:37] And tonight we're going to be favored by
[44:39] hearing brother Lance Laroo speak to us.
[44:44] Amen. It's always good to come ready and
[44:47] be prepared and know who to pray for.
[44:50] Amen.
[44:53] For our light affliction,
[44:56] which is but for a moment, workketh for
[44:58] us a far more exceeding and eternal
[45:01] weight of glory.
[45:04] While we look not at the things which
[45:06] are seen, excuse me, but at the things
[45:10] which are not seen, for the things which
[45:13] are seen are temporal, but the things
[45:16] which are not seen are eternal. Let's
[45:20] read together the 18th verse, please.
[45:23] While we look not at the things which
[45:26] are seen, but at the things which are
[45:29] not seen, for the things which are seen
[45:32] are temporal, but the things which are
[45:35] not seen are eternal. God bless you. And
[45:38] you may have your seats. If you would
[45:40] like to, please keep your Bibles handy.
[45:44] We'll be looking at some other
[45:45] scriptures as well.
[45:49] The things which are seen are temporal.
[45:53] They're enduring only for a short while.
[45:57] They are obviously temporary. They're
[46:00] for a season.
[46:02] Those are the things which are seen. Do
[46:05] you believe that?
[46:07] &gt;&gt; That's good. The things which are unseen
[46:11] are eternal.
[46:14] They're without beginning and end. and
[46:17] that which always has been and always
[46:19] will be.
[46:21] You have eternal life.
[46:24] You didn't get eternal life. You have
[46:28] eternal life. Have always had eternal
[46:30] life. At some point in time, God made
[46:33] you aware of it.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; God brought you and made you aware that
[46:37] you were a sinner. That Christ died for
[46:40] you. He was your sacrifice. that the
[46:43] price of and the penalty for your sin
[46:45] has been paid and that you are a son or
[46:48] daughter of God. That's what God made
[46:50] you to know. But you always had eternal
[46:53] life.
[46:55] In the message awakening Jesus,
[47:00] brother Brandham says, "The whole armor
[47:02] of Christianity is faith.
[47:05] Everything that we have is unseen." I'd
[47:08] like you to notice these words very,
[47:10] very closely.
[47:12] And I'd like your kind, undivided
[47:14] attention because you'll need to follow
[47:17] me very, very close this morning.
[47:20] Everything that we have is unseen.
[47:24] The only things that's real is unseen,
[47:29] unexplained.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; The things that can be explained are not
[47:35] real.
[47:37] They're superficial and die.
[47:41] But the things that cannot be explained
[47:44] are immortal.
[47:46] The whole realm,
[47:49] you know, that is such a if that's an
[47:51] incredibly scientific statement.
[47:55] If you were to go into and read what uh
[47:59] you know the mathematicians and the
[48:03] intellectuals,
[48:05] the Einsteins, the Stephven Hawkings and
[48:08] and a whole list of them and I've list
[48:11] I've read over, you know, over years and
[48:15] even more recently and even now as I was
[48:17] approaching this message, just reviewed
[48:20] and read what some of these men say.
[48:22] They're trying to understand the the
[48:24] universe
[48:26] and they want to try to grasp excuse me
[48:30] try to grasp the smallest particle and
[48:34] they feel if they could just discover
[48:37] the smallest smallest of particles then
[48:40] they would understand the entire
[48:42] universe and it it but as you read
[48:45] anything that they say generally
[48:48] speaking there's more questions that
[48:50] arise
[48:52] than even answers because they they are
[48:56] actually void of a of an absolute and
[49:01] they use the word realities
[49:04] uh the realities because what is a
[49:07] reality when they speak of the entire
[49:10] cosmos the entire universe uh what is
[49:14] real and what is not real and I want to
[49:17] speak on this subject of realities this
[49:20] morning I will be using the word many
[49:22] times. But now that's where brother
[49:25] Brown said what you see is not real.
[49:29] What you can explain
[49:31] it's it's that's that's temporary and
[49:35] it's a thing that can't be explained
[49:38] that you believe because you can believe
[49:41] for things
[49:42] &gt;&gt; that cannot be explained.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; You cannot understand
[49:47] these things that are truly realities.
[49:50] And I am entitling this a title that's
[49:54] in my heart, hungering for the realities
[49:58] of God.
[50:00] That's where I want to come from. And I
[50:03] I would like to think that I'm amongst a
[50:05] company of people today
[50:08] that we don't just want to know or get
[50:11] some more information about the
[50:14] realities of God. We want to be
[50:17] hungering for those things. Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Hungering for things that are beyond
[50:21] this mortal life,
[50:24] &gt;&gt; this beyond this temporary life,
[50:28] &gt;&gt; things that are a moving target.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; They're not eternal.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; And people today, we hear and perhaps
[50:36] you've said, "What is real?
[50:38] Uh, I want reality." Or we have a term,
[50:42] and I hear it amongst the young people,
[50:43] get real. You know, well, what is it
[50:46] that they're really saying? I I guess
[50:49] they want people to, you know, uh come
[50:52] to a a reality of of of their
[50:54] circumstances or their surroundings or
[50:56] whatever more. But the scripture tells
[50:59] us also
[51:02] Paul speaking in 1 Corinthians 7 and30.
[51:05] He said, "And they that weep as though
[51:07] they weep not, and they that rejoice as
[51:09] though they rejoice not, and they that
[51:12] buy as though they possess not." In
[51:14] other words, we we can be involved in
[51:18] things. We can be a part of things as
[51:21] you are. But is this life even real as
[51:25] far as a reality of God is concerned?
[51:29] And because it's a passing, because
[51:31] you're only passing through this season
[51:36] of time, this allotted time that God has
[51:39] given you. I would like to say that what
[51:42] we are mostly consumed with is not a
[51:45] reality.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; What we spend most of our time at is not
[51:53] a reality in the even in the scientific
[51:57] sense and certainly not in the spiritual
[51:59] sense.
[52:01] So is something real because I believe
[52:04] it.
[52:07] I'm just asking some questions.
[52:09] Is it real? Because I had what is can be
[52:13] termed some kind of spiritual
[52:15] experience. I I felt a jiggle. I got a
[52:19] goosebumps. I saw a flash of light. I
[52:21] heard a thunder or you know some
[52:24] physical thing happened or some
[52:26] emotional. I wept till I my eyes were
[52:29] swollen shut. Uh nothing wrong with
[52:32] those things. But is it a reality
[52:34] because I had that experience? I don't
[52:38] think so.
[52:40] Is it a reality because I changed my
[52:42] ways and I quit doing a whole lot of
[52:45] things that I began to feel guilty about
[52:48] and I thought was wrong and so I quit my
[52:51] carousing or my drinking or my smoking
[52:53] or things that are bad habits. I I quit
[52:56] those. And so I've had is that a
[52:58] reality? All kinds of people do that and
[53:02] they have all kinds of different
[53:04] beliefs.
[53:05] And so then we get to something that
[53:07] says what is a reality?
[53:09] uh a person an individual maybe has a
[53:13] certain experience that I oh this is so
[53:16] real to me but is it actually a a
[53:19] reality of God and then perhaps two
[53:22] people will agree on on a certain uh
[53:26] subject or a certain perception see
[53:29] things a certain way say well it this
[53:32] must be because we've agreed on it and
[53:35] then we could have uh a group of people
[53:39] a greater number of people that would
[53:41] assemble and began to believe along the
[53:44] same line and believe the same thing.
[53:47] And then we have a general consensus
[53:50] uh and and we have something now is it
[53:52] real? Because now there's a larger group
[53:54] that believe it. And so we have a a
[53:57] structure of belief. And for that we
[54:00] could say that will largely explain all
[54:03] the different churches and organizations
[54:05] and societies and and denominations and
[54:09] on and on. And all of them all of them
[54:14] believe what they believe because they
[54:16] believe it's the truth.
[54:19] And absolute truth
[54:22] is a reality.
[54:25] But there cannot be 3,000 realities.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; There cannot be 3,000 truths. They can
[54:33] say I could say there could be truth
[54:37] because people believe it's truth. And
[54:39] so from their perception we'll say all
[54:41] right we say it's truth plural but it is
[54:45] not truth singular. There can only be
[54:49] one truth singular.
[54:51] I say as a prophet of God said God is a
[54:55] reality
[54:58] &gt;&gt; not gods because there are many gods and
[55:00] many different beliefs in God but I'll
[55:02] say God whoever that God is is a reality
[55:07] and when God that God when he speaks and
[55:12] it happens
[55:14] that's a reality. So I'd say his word is
[55:17] a reality.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:21] Then I say, "Now, if that God speaks and
[55:24] he actually comes forward and confirms
[55:28] that he's the one that's speaking, then
[55:31] we we we have a confirmation of that
[55:34] reality."
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Now, you might think that I'm venturing
[55:38] out there, but just stay with me.
[55:42] Now you know people have we can speak
[55:45] about all kinds of great names and great
[55:48] evangelists and great uh leaders and
[55:51] every organization every group got the
[55:54] great leaders
[55:58] but when you have now I've just quoted
[56:00] brother Brandham here I just want to say
[56:01] something
[56:03] when you have a man and I'm going to
[56:06] read in a little bit how the angel came
[56:09] to him and the simplicity of it and how
[56:13] difficult it was for him to believe it.
[56:16] Said, "You're going to stand before
[56:17] kings and monarchs. You're going to
[56:19] preach. You're going to bring a a
[56:22] ministry of healing." And he said it was
[56:24] a shock to him and it was hard for him
[56:26] to believe, hard for him to accept. But
[56:31] and then he because he said, "I don't
[56:32] even know how to speak. I don't know how
[56:34] to I only have a grade seven education.
[56:37] I don't know how to present. I don't
[56:39] know how to put words together. I don't
[56:40] know how to bring my thoughts out and I
[56:44] speak so halting and so on. Those aren't
[56:46] exactly his words, but that's
[56:47] essentially what he said. And he said,
[56:49] "How is this going to be?" And the angel
[56:52] of God, who is the angel of the Lord,
[56:54] none other than the spirit of the Lord
[56:56] Jesus Christ, said, "I will be with you.
[56:58] Have no fear. I'll be with you." Then he
[57:01] said, "Then I'll go."
[57:05] Now then you have the opportunity to sit
[57:07] and you listen and hear a man speak. And
[57:11] here we are today and I'm really laying
[57:13] this down to your address. You're either
[57:15] here as a you know just a uh because my
[57:19] friends are here. I'm here because my
[57:21] parents are here. I'm here because
[57:22] somebody's here. I'm here because you
[57:25] know this is where I always go. I've
[57:26] been here for years.
[57:29] But if we're not here because you
[57:31] believe it's truth,
[57:33] &gt;&gt; then you're in the wrong place.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; We need a reality of truth.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; And so when I hear a man who confesses,
[57:42] I speak with such halting English. I
[57:45] don't know proper words. I don't know
[57:47] how to put the things together. But then
[57:50] when he speaks it is it is almost like
[57:53] uh it it it
[57:56] fits into phrases that he makes fits
[57:58] into the scientific realm. Phrases that
[58:01] he makes fits into the medical realm
[58:04] fits into all kinds of the realms of the
[58:07] intellectual people. But then he says
[58:10] now
[58:11] &gt;&gt; if the God
[58:14] &gt;&gt; if God if I have told the truth
[58:18] &gt;&gt; not truths plural but if I have spoken
[58:21] the truth then let that God come now and
[58:27] prove that that's the truth.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; And on one occasion if you haven't if
[58:33] you haven't seen the DVD of the
[58:35] interview that we have with with Mr.
[58:37] Mitchell. Uh, I know Mr. Mitchell. He's
[58:40] passed on now. I know Mr. Mitchell. I've
[58:43] got the quote here. I'm going to read
[58:45] it, Lord willing, later on. But I
[58:47] interviewed him in Roman Oak, West
[58:49] Virginia at the television station.
[58:52] And we sat down and uh uh he began to
[58:56] tell he had never heard of Brother
[58:58] Brandham. He never heard of William
[59:00] Brham. He is a mine worker. He worked in
[59:03] the mines in Virginia. and uh and then
[59:07] he he he got a a a tumor in his lung the
[59:12] size of a man's fist and they had him to
[59:15] Bristol and to two other hospitals and
[59:19] they confirmed that tumor and said that
[59:22] and and then the mining company want to
[59:24] know what kind of liability they had
[59:27] with this man's situation and they uh
[59:31] sent him to these various hospitals
[59:33] three of them and said that tumor has to
[59:35] come out immediately. And he said, "Uh,
[59:39] well, just wait." And his pastor, who
[59:42] was Brother Ernest Fulture at that time,
[59:44] or his friend, Brother Fulture knew of
[59:48] Brother Brandham, and he said, "I'll
[59:50] take you down there." And so, he doesn't
[59:53] even know where he's going. And they
[59:55] take him. And Brother Fulture drives him
[59:58] to Jeffersonville. And brother Brandham
[1:00:00] is preaching this day is this scripture
[1:00:04] fulfilled in your ears. And that man is
[1:00:07] sitting down in the down in the
[1:00:10] auditorium in the church there. And
[1:00:12] brother Brandham preaches this day is
[1:00:15] this scripture. And he takes it back to
[1:00:17] when Jesus read certain scripture. And
[1:00:19] now he's declaring that that same Jesus
[1:00:22] is present now again revealing himself.
[1:00:26] And he begins to speak and he says this
[1:00:28] day, it comes to the end of the service.
[1:00:31] They had no prayer cards. This day is
[1:00:34] the scripture. He said, "Let the God
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; that spoke the word,
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; let the God that brought the message, if
[1:00:42] he be God, let him go, let him come
[1:00:45] forth now."
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; And he does.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And he calls this man out. And he says,
[1:00:52] "There's a man there." And you have a uh
[1:00:56] you have been a mind worker. And the
[1:01:00] reason and that is so profound to me
[1:01:02] because he had been a mind worker. He
[1:01:05] was a mind worker. But from that time on
[1:01:09] he became a pastor of a church. And how
[1:01:13] accurate and how how marvelous it was
[1:01:15] that God begins to speak. You have been
[1:01:18] a mind worker. See, God doesn't only
[1:01:21] know what you wear. He knows what you're
[1:01:23] going to be. Amen. And he says, "You
[1:01:26] have been a mind worker." And he said,
[1:01:28] "You have a tumor and it's in your left
[1:01:31] lung." And he told them all about and he
[1:01:33] says, "Go back to Virginia, Mr.
[1:01:36] Mitchell,
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; and be well." And the man went back to
[1:01:40] the same hospitals and they couldn't
[1:01:42] find that tumor with the X-rays. And
[1:01:45] he's standing right there. Now I tell
[1:01:48] you what friends, now you have, now you
[1:01:50] have not a scientist,
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; not a scientist, not one who's trying to
[1:01:56] figure out, you know, the the influence
[1:01:58] of the quarks on things and has has
[1:02:01] reduced things down to the most uh
[1:02:03] minute particle and beyond what even can
[1:02:07] be seen because they say they can't see
[1:02:09] quirs. They can only see their influence
[1:02:11] on other on other material and they're
[1:02:14] trying to determine gravity and and the
[1:02:17] how light curves and one effect and all
[1:02:20] the planetary system and if they could
[1:02:23] figure that out then they they figure
[1:02:25] then we can discover what the true
[1:02:28] reality is. What is the reality in these
[1:02:31] things? I say we have discovered not
[1:02:33] because I'm saying it. It's not truth
[1:02:36] because I say it. It's truth because God
[1:02:39] confirmed it.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; What tells this man, there's a man there
[1:02:44] with a tumor in his lung and he's from
[1:02:46] Virginia and he has been a mine worker
[1:02:50] and he's going to go home and you're
[1:02:52] going to be well. That's an absolute.
[1:02:55] [Applause]
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Is his name Mitchell? Yes. Does he have
[1:02:59] a tumor? Yes. But but the tumor is not a
[1:03:03] reality.
[1:03:05] Your sickness is not a reality.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Because the reality does away with the
[1:03:11] sickness.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Our mortality is not a reality. Your
[1:03:17] life here is not a reality. Because it's
[1:03:20] not absolute. It's passing. You are a
[1:03:23] moving target. You're only here for a
[1:03:26] season. Everything you touch is only for
[1:03:28] a season. I'm here to declare today,
[1:03:31] these things are not realities.
[1:03:35] That's why natural and mortal things and
[1:03:38] and the things of this life can never
[1:03:40] satisfy you.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; One person is strong and healthy and
[1:03:47] handsome and uh maybe a young lady has
[1:03:49] got her youth and she's beautiful.
[1:03:51] Forget it. It's a moving target.
[1:03:54] If time goes on, you're going to be
[1:03:56] gray-haired and and you're going to be
[1:03:58] stooped over and your breath's going to
[1:04:00] come short on you because it's not a
[1:04:03] reality.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; The things which are seen are temporal.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; And the things which are not seen are
[1:04:10] eternal.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; And I think we ought to be consumed with
[1:04:16] things that are eternal. I think that we
[1:04:19] ought to have our minds on where we're
[1:04:21] going,
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; not where we are today.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Reality.
[1:04:31] They say that a reality is the state of
[1:04:34] things as they actually exist.
[1:04:40] You say, well, here I am. This is the,
[1:04:42] you know, this is the order of things in
[1:04:44] my life. This is what I'm facing. This
[1:04:46] is where I work.
[1:04:49] Your profession is not a reality.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Your life here is not a reality.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; A reality is what is real
[1:05:06] and what is actual fact
[1:05:10] and what is truth.
[1:05:13] A reality is the aggregate sum
[1:05:17] of real things. Could be the total sum
[1:05:21] of real things.
[1:05:24] Listen to this now. A reality is the
[1:05:27] substance that lies back of form and
[1:05:31] external appearances.
[1:05:34] So here we are now. We are here in our
[1:05:38] appearance.
[1:05:40] We have a certain
[1:05:42] physical appearance
[1:05:46] and you may feel very real but that
[1:05:48] appearance is not a reality.
[1:05:52] There is a substance
[1:05:54] which lies behind the form
[1:05:58] which you are just projecting.
[1:06:00] There's an unseen
[1:06:03] that is in you. That is why the prophet
[1:06:06] of God says we have never seen one
[1:06:09] another.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; You only see the physical external
[1:06:15] appearance that declares the person
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; but you have never seen the person. We
[1:06:22] have never met one another. Never seen
[1:06:26] one another. We have met, shook hands,
[1:06:29] perhaps embraced whatever more, married,
[1:06:32] have children and all the rest of it.
[1:06:33] But you have never seen each other,
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; the real person.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And that is why regardless of even how
[1:06:42] long you've lived together and how close
[1:06:44] you may become as husband and wife or as
[1:06:48] a family member or in the church as a
[1:06:51] church member, you never really have
[1:06:53] seen one another and cannot fully fully
[1:06:59] there. There's a restriction. You can't
[1:07:01] fully describe and say everything that's
[1:07:05] in the inner person because that inner
[1:07:08] person's even a mystery to you.
[1:07:19] in them.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; That is a reality.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Because God, it came from the eternal
[1:07:26] God.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; And I hope it doesn't offend you or
[1:07:31] surprise you if I say there's much of
[1:07:34] humanity
[1:07:36] that are passing over
[1:07:40] the earth like waves of the sea that is
[1:07:44] not a reality.
[1:07:50] They appear. What is your life?
[1:07:53] It's even as a vapor
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; that appears for a little while
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; and then vanishes.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; What is your life? That's what the God
[1:08:02] word says in in James gospel.
[1:08:07] A reality therefore is the absolute.
[1:08:12] And also in the encyclopedia it says
[1:08:15] that it is that which is selfexistent.
[1:08:20] How many times have we heard the
[1:08:21] messenger say that God Jehovah almighty
[1:08:26] God is the self-existent one who fills
[1:08:30] all time and space. He's the
[1:08:33] self-existent one. He is a reality.
[1:08:38] And when out of his bosom comes the word
[1:08:41] of God, the logos of God, the very logos
[1:08:45] which is a part of him. That is a
[1:08:47] reality.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; So in the beginning,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; the scripture says, "And God said, let
[1:08:55] there be light. The the reality was
[1:08:58] speaking."
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; And God created a heavens and an earth
[1:09:03] by the word of God. Amen.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; And that was a reality. But then by sin,
[1:09:10] everything fell.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; The creation was lost.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Man's fellowship with God was lost. And
[1:09:18] man lost his way. And now the reality
[1:09:21] was gone.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; If you can follow me,
[1:09:29] the scripture, I'm just going to leave
[1:09:30] that for a moment. The scripture says,
[1:09:35] "Now faith,
[1:09:37] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:09:40] for, the evidence of things not seen."
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; It's the evidence of things that are not
[1:09:48] seen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Faith, in other words, is a uh it is a
[1:09:53] channel. Faith is the six sense. Faith
[1:09:57] can reach out into the unknown. Faith
[1:10:01] can reach out and believe that which is
[1:10:03] not seen. Faith can reach out and take a
[1:10:07] hold of that which cannot be
[1:10:09] comprehended with your mind and it can
[1:10:12] bring it down and can be seen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; I hunger
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; for the realities of God. Amen.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in religion. I'm not
[1:10:33] interested in church anity. I'm not
[1:10:35] interested even in this church. I'm
[1:10:37] interested in the realities of God.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in people that hunger for
[1:10:42] the realities of God.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in human baggage.
[1:10:50] I'm not interested in that which
[1:10:52] accumulates in this life.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Be they possessions or be they uh
[1:11:00] achievements
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; or some great uh fame and goal, we're
[1:11:06] not interested in it. Whatever God gives
[1:11:08] you, you hold it loosely in your hand.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; If he gives you little, you thank him.
[1:11:14] If he gives you much, you thank him. But
[1:11:16] you don't hang. You don't hold it. You
[1:11:18] don't grip it and hold it like that's a
[1:11:22] reality. It's not.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; We came into the world with nothing and
[1:11:26] we leave with nothing.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; It's not real. Friends,
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; you that are in hardships right now, let
[1:11:34] me tell you, your hardship is not a
[1:11:36] reality.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; I can say this too shall pass.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; How can it pass? Because it's not a
[1:11:45] reality. You that are in the good times
[1:11:47] and you're having the good life, let me
[1:11:49] tell you that's not a reality.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; I say that with all the authority of
[1:11:55] God's word. It's not a reality. The good
[1:11:57] life is not a reality. The bad life is
[1:12:00] not a reality.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; They're passing.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; There's something in the human heart
[1:12:10] that
[1:12:12] hungers for simplicity.
[1:12:15] Yeah.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; When brother Murphy showed the slides of
[1:12:19] China
[1:12:21] and he showed this one woman
[1:12:23] and this one woman was searching
[1:12:27] and she wanted she'd heard something
[1:12:29] about this message, an elderly woman
[1:12:33] and she told her daughter,
[1:12:35] "Get on the internet and search and find
[1:12:38] out where this message come from and
[1:12:41] this prophet of God and I need to
[1:12:45] discover more. And anyway, the girl
[1:12:47] found on internet site, found our
[1:12:50] website, our Chinese website,
[1:12:54] and she got some messages. And then that
[1:12:56] woman witnessed to another one and
[1:12:58] another one, another one, and a short
[1:13:00] few months down the road, here's a group
[1:13:02] of women.
[1:13:05] They're poor,
[1:13:07] extremely poor.
[1:13:09] And brother Murphy was just he wasn't he
[1:13:11] wasn't making any specific point. He was
[1:13:13] just saying this is the group of a year
[1:13:16] or so later.
[1:13:18] He says and they're 99%
[1:13:21] widows. They're just by themselves in
[1:13:25] this village.
[1:13:26] They're 99%
[1:13:29] povertystricken.
[1:13:32] They get about $100 a month in some kind
[1:13:36] of a pension.
[1:13:38] And Murphy says he doesn't even know how
[1:13:40] they survive buying food on $100 a
[1:13:44] month.
[1:13:46] And he says, "And yet when they had this
[1:13:49] meeting just recently, the first time
[1:13:50] they had a meeting in China with no
[1:13:53] outside minister
[1:13:55] didn't call Murphy, didn't call anyone
[1:13:57] else. And they said, "We want this to be
[1:13:59] a made in China meeting. This is by the
[1:14:02] Chinese and for the Chinese." And so
[1:14:04] they had this gathering for the first
[1:14:06] time and groups of people came and
[1:14:09] workers and ministers and as you know
[1:14:12] everything has to be on a very small
[1:14:13] scale little house meetings and so on so
[1:14:15] forth and they gathered a group of
[1:14:17] people there. These women contacted I
[1:14:20] guess brother Murphy and the brothers
[1:14:22] over there and said we have put together
[1:14:25] we have saved our money and we've saved
[1:14:28] $2,000
[1:14:29] that we want to contribute.
[1:14:32] We want to be blessed also. They said,
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; "We just don't want foreigners to be
[1:14:37] blessed. We don't want others to be just
[1:14:39] blessed. We must have a blessing. And we
[1:14:41] want this to go to get this same
[1:14:44] message, which we love, to get it to
[1:14:46] other Chinese and other remote places
[1:14:48] and sent $2,000."
[1:14:53] There were brothers that sitting in
[1:14:54] Germany came to me and said when they
[1:14:57] showed those slides and we heard and saw
[1:15:00] the sincerity of the people said we were
[1:15:03] stunned
[1:15:06] I could never be the same one brother
[1:15:08] said to me a businessman
[1:15:13] there's something in us
[1:15:15] that when we see that kind of simplicity
[1:15:20] we even see that what we would call
[1:15:22] poverty,
[1:15:25] extreme poverty. They have it's like
[1:15:27] nothing. It becomes nothingness.
[1:15:31] And when we say that there's something
[1:15:34] down
[1:15:35] in the inner being
[1:15:39] that craves
[1:15:41] that kind of simplicity.
[1:15:44] And when we see those kind of people
[1:15:47] that don't have access to, you know, the
[1:15:51] medical clinic and this specialist and
[1:15:53] that one and can go down to the
[1:15:55] emergency and show their card or
[1:15:57] whatever more, have the state or
[1:15:59] whatever more and and can get access to
[1:16:02] right away medical treatment and so on.
[1:16:05] And they don't have that. They have a
[1:16:07] simplicity.
[1:16:09] This is what God said
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; and this is what God did
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; and this is what the Bible says
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; and God can't lie.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; And so we and it just says do this and
[1:16:23] so we'll do that. Just lay hands on
[1:16:26] someone. So we'll lay hands on them and
[1:16:28] it'll all be over.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It works. Amen.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; What has happened is faith
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; has taken a hold
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; of the realities of God and brought it
[1:16:41] down into this realm.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; And thus they have it. And that's why we
[1:16:47] look at it and we say that simplicity is
[1:16:50] wonderful
[1:16:52] because there's something within our own
[1:16:55] being that craves and desires that
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; and that goes way beyond. We're not
[1:17:01] worried about how the piano sounded or
[1:17:04] how the music or how the how the deacons
[1:17:07] were or how the temperature was in the
[1:17:09] church. Doesn't make any difference.
[1:17:11] Maybe you're sitting on a little
[1:17:12] plastic. Maybe you're sitting on a mat
[1:17:14] or like it was in India or we were in
[1:17:17] even in New Delhi, India and everybody
[1:17:19] had wool parkers on and and and were
[1:17:22] blankets around them and sitting on the
[1:17:24] concrete floor and it couldn't hardly
[1:17:25] move in there. It was so cold, so
[1:17:28] frigid. And while you're while I was
[1:17:30] preaching preaching then all the lights
[1:17:32] go out and it's total blackness. You
[1:17:34] think anybody left or anybody made light
[1:17:36] of it? No. They were just sitting there
[1:17:38] waiting hungering waiting for the rest
[1:17:40] of the word of God.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; And there's something in us that hungers
[1:17:44] for that simplicity.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Because we can find in that realm it it
[1:17:51] seems that we have a a clearer channel
[1:17:54] for our faith to work. Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; But when we get into this cluttered
[1:17:59] life,
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; do you call it that? Is that all right?
[1:18:02] This cluttered life, this uh life that's
[1:18:05] filled with so many labors and so many
[1:18:08] concerns and so much confusion and
[1:18:11] crosscurrens of every direction. It's
[1:18:13] hard to find the channel. But oh my
[1:18:16] brother, my sister, I want you to agree
[1:18:18] with me today. God, open up that
[1:18:20] channel. I hunger for the realities of
[1:18:23] God.
[1:18:30] Faith is the substance
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; and the substance is that which has
[1:18:35] foundation.
[1:18:37] The substance is that which is firm. The
[1:18:41] substance is that which actually exists.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; And that's what the scientists say a
[1:18:46] reality is is something that actually
[1:18:49] exists. Faith is the substance. Faith is
[1:18:53] that which actually exists. In other
[1:18:56] words, I say faith is either the reality
[1:18:58] or will bring the reality to you.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; By faith, we move from the negative to
[1:19:09] the positive.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; By faith, we move from that which is
[1:19:14] temporal and passing
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; to that which is eternal
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; and lasting.
[1:19:20] By faith
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; we pass from the from the seen to the
[1:19:25] unseen. Amen.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; And I know this is hard because
[1:19:30] you know we speak about these things and
[1:19:32] I know that you know you mothers and
[1:19:35] you've got families, you've got
[1:19:37] children, you've got concerns and you
[1:19:39] you know we've got activities and
[1:19:41] schools and and we've got uh meetings
[1:19:44] and we have all kinds of home life that
[1:19:48] we daily life that we need to look
[1:19:50] after.
[1:19:52] But let me take you into the scripture
[1:19:53] just briefly for a moment.
[1:19:57] You know what is really
[1:20:00] number one
[1:20:02] needs to be number one on our agenda
[1:20:06] and that is that you recognize
[1:20:10] the person
[1:20:12] of Jesus Christ
[1:20:15] presently.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; That is number one. Thank you for your
[1:20:19] amen brother.
[1:20:22] When Jesus was here,
[1:20:26] they had their concerns. They had their
[1:20:28] families. They had their jobs, their
[1:20:31] loss of jobs. They had their fish. The
[1:20:34] nets were broken. They were mending
[1:20:36] their nets. They had their old parents
[1:20:38] to care for. They had all their
[1:20:41] concerns. They had to buy things. They
[1:20:44] had to feed people. Those people, they
[1:20:48] had to wash. They had to sleep
[1:20:50] someplace. They had they had their
[1:20:52] natural burdens. The scripture says very
[1:20:55] little about it because it's not a
[1:20:57] reality.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; So Jesus didn't say don't don't pay any
[1:21:03] attention to that. Don't have it, you
[1:21:05] know, don't do that. You don't have to
[1:21:07] care for that. Of course, they had to
[1:21:09] care for that. But the key question was
[1:21:11] when Jesus finally said to them, who do
[1:21:14] men say I am?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; And who do you say I am?
[1:21:20] And the prophet comes in his days and
[1:21:22] says, "Who do you say this is?"
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Who who is this
[1:21:27] Melkazedc?"
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "What shall I do with this
[1:21:32] Jesus called Christ?"
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; What is the whole message? The whole the
[1:21:36] whole uh the whole out of the message is
[1:21:40] that it's not Christ back in the Bible
[1:21:42] 2,000 years ago. It's Christ now. And
[1:21:44] who do you say this is? In other words,
[1:21:47] who have you recognized? Amen.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Who is it that you're feeling? Because
[1:21:51] that's the only reality that we actually
[1:21:54] have.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's what substance real substance.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; That's what's not passing away.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; That's what's eternal.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; So I got this certain achievement or I I
[1:22:11] I you know I was successful here or I
[1:22:15] was a failure there. the failure or the
[1:22:18] success. In my books, according to the
[1:22:21] message that I'm speaking to you this
[1:22:23] morning, neither is a reality.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; I failed my grades.
[1:22:29] Maybe your parents are displeased with
[1:22:31] you or I got straight A's. Wonderful.
[1:22:36] And I pray that you I I feel we need to
[1:22:39] do our best. And whatever we do, we
[1:22:41] should do it as unto the Lord. We should
[1:22:43] do it as a real Christian. What I'm
[1:22:44] speaking today is is not uh uh
[1:22:50] forgetting that we have a a natural life
[1:22:52] but what it is saying we have friends
[1:22:56] and I have to say it far too much
[1:22:58] emphasis on this life.
[1:23:03] It fills our conversation.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; And when you think of it according to
[1:23:07] the word of God,
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; when you speak about this life and all
[1:23:12] the activities and all the things, just
[1:23:14] remember Apostle Paul's words. It is not
[1:23:18] eternal.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; It is temporal.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; It is passing. And it will leave your
[1:23:25] hands. It will leave your mind. It will
[1:23:28] leave your life because it is not a
[1:23:30] reality. Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; There are a number of places in the
[1:23:44] message brother Brandham talks about the
[1:23:47] word and the word the word which is a
[1:23:50] reality the word
[1:23:54] materialized.
[1:23:55] So then it became physical
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; or became it became something that was
[1:24:01] visible. It came down into this realm.
[1:24:06] And that's why I believe that science is
[1:24:08] still trying attempting to understand
[1:24:11] the realities in the creation.
[1:24:15] And I tend to believe that the word of
[1:24:18] God and what the word brings
[1:24:22] is the only substance and is the only
[1:24:25] reality and substance or material things
[1:24:29] can only testify to the word
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; for an allotted time. I'm only here,
[1:24:35] you're only here. We have an allotted
[1:24:38] period of time and you're going to
[1:24:39] testify to something and one day if time
[1:24:42] should go on there'll be a marker on
[1:24:43] your grave
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; saying whatever year you started to the
[1:24:48] year you ended that'll be it.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; May you rest in peace.
[1:24:57] May you go on to his reward
[1:25:00] and somebody will get up and say some
[1:25:01] nice things about you.
[1:25:06] But if in this life that God has
[1:25:08] allotted us so much space of time,
[1:25:14] the greatest thing that we could do is
[1:25:17] to give expression to something that is
[1:25:21] actually a reality.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And that is why I'm speaking about what
[1:25:29] a reality is and what a reality isn't.
[1:25:31] And I hope you don't think I wear the
[1:25:33] word out. Please,
[1:25:37] here's a little
[1:25:40] what the what some of the wise people
[1:25:44] say I guess about this. The term reality
[1:25:47] in its widest sense,
[1:25:50] this is
[1:25:52] what people who have a lot more human
[1:25:54] wisdom than I say about it.
[1:25:56] The term reality in its widest sense
[1:25:59] includes everything that is whether or
[1:26:03] not it is observable or comprehensible.
[1:26:08] Whether you can see it or you can't see
[1:26:10] it.
[1:26:13] The term reality
[1:26:15] in its widest or broadest sense
[1:26:19] includes everything
[1:26:22] that can be observed or whether it's not
[1:26:25] observable or comprehensible.
[1:26:29] The term reality is real existence
[1:26:32] actual being or existence
[1:26:36] as opposed to an imaginary
[1:26:39] mere appearance. You know when I say
[1:26:41] imaginary.
[1:26:43] Hey,
[1:26:45] churches across this land are absolutely
[1:26:47] packed with people
[1:26:50] and they are absolutely convinced
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; that they're believing the truth.
[1:26:57] Many are absolutely convinced they have
[1:27:00] eternal life.
[1:27:02] They are convinced even though they may
[1:27:04] believe in a trinity
[1:27:06] which they cannot explain
[1:27:09] and it's something out there uh that has
[1:27:12] come down been filtered down through all
[1:27:15] the church ages
[1:27:17] uh a a baptism that is not in the
[1:27:20] scriptures and they'll hang on to that.
[1:27:23] How can it be a reality?
[1:27:26] How can baptism be a reality of father,
[1:27:29] son, and holy ghost? They say, "Well,
[1:27:32] Jesus said it." Isn't it amazing that
[1:27:34] Jesus said it and told Apostle Peter
[1:27:38] that I give you the keys to the kingdom?
[1:27:41] And Peter stands up on the day of
[1:27:43] Pentecost, full of the Holy Spirit,
[1:27:46] which is the very spirit of Jesus
[1:27:47] Christ, and goes directly against what
[1:27:50] Jesus said.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; If you believe a trinity doctrine,
[1:27:56] Baptize them in the name of the father
[1:27:57] and the son and the holy ghost. How can
[1:27:59] intelligence people say the word the
[1:28:02] first word in the name and say well
[1:28:04] isn't it natural to say what is the
[1:28:05] name?
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; What is the name of the father? What is
[1:28:08] the name of the son? What is the name of
[1:28:10] the holy ghost? Father, son, and holy
[1:28:12] ghost is the lord Jesus Christ.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; That's his name. Amen.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:28:21] if we don't grasp that, I want you to
[1:28:24] stay with me now. If we don't grasp
[1:28:26] that, if the words, if Jesus was the
[1:28:30] word made flesh
[1:28:33] and he spoke directly out, the word
[1:28:36] speaking directly out, I'd say that the
[1:28:39] life of Christ was the only reality on
[1:28:43] earth at that time.
[1:28:46] And what he spoke and what his word
[1:28:48] brought forth
[1:28:50] also is a reality.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; And it says it's a
[1:28:56] imaginary as opposed to imaginary
[1:29:00] or mere appearance.
[1:29:03] All that exists or happens. Everything
[1:29:06] that actually does or could exist or
[1:29:08] happen in real life
[1:29:11] speaking. This is what the world is
[1:29:12] saying.
[1:29:14] A a reality is
[1:29:20] in proof of the resurrection.
[1:29:25] Now to comprehend says what that can be
[1:29:28] comprehended. The human mind can't
[1:29:31] comprehend
[1:29:32] spiritual things.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; The human mind can't comprehend it.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; I mean understand it fully. So we see it
[1:29:41] out there and and it it brother Brandon
[1:29:46] brings it this way. It it comes into the
[1:29:47] mind but then it has to fall down into
[1:29:50] the heart. Says there's one channel to
[1:29:52] the soul and in that channel we either
[1:29:54] believe or we disbelieve.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; If we disbelieve it's it it cannot be a
[1:30:00] reality. If we believe that faith can
[1:30:03] bring us
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; to a re a real experience. So in proof
[1:30:08] of his resurrection,
[1:30:10] brother Brandham says, "So in order to
[1:30:12] get the truth to man
[1:30:16] to God, God sent his own son made in
[1:30:20] likeness of sinful flesh and he was born
[1:30:23] here on earth. And he was a propitiation
[1:30:25] for our sins, offered up at the day of
[1:30:28] Calvary to take away our sins and to
[1:30:31] give us liberty and to set us free from
[1:30:33] the prison houses that we've been in.
[1:30:37] Now man is a prisoner.
[1:30:40] God said that a man was a prisoner. So
[1:30:44] until something has happened to the man
[1:30:47] I he said and he says now I want you to
[1:30:49] get this now
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; that before this certain thing called
[1:30:54] the new birth. So before this certain
[1:30:57] thing called the new birth ever happens
[1:31:01] to the man, he can he cannot no way at
[1:31:06] all understand or ever understand God
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; or have any knowledge of God.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Listen now. Though the word speaks it,
[1:31:19] his mind can't comprehend it. I can tell
[1:31:23] you friends, brother Brandham is
[1:31:24] actually speaking scientific language
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; and that you can hear it and then you
[1:31:30] imagine now here I'm speaking today and
[1:31:33] all this group of people here you know
[1:31:35] one sitting right next to another the
[1:31:37] reason why what we receive is not a
[1:31:40] reality just through the hearing of the
[1:31:42] ears is because your perception one
[1:31:45] person's perception of what I say oh
[1:31:47] they're getting this next person sitting
[1:31:49] right beside them oh it's this way it's
[1:31:52] this way.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; But when when what is spoken for faith
[1:31:56] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:31:58] word of God, faith cometh by hearing.
[1:32:01] And so a person hears the word of God
[1:32:05] and by faith they lay hold of that even
[1:32:08] though they can't comprehend it
[1:32:10] completely and their mind is unfruitful
[1:32:13] in their understanding. They say, "I
[1:32:15] know God said that. That's God's word.
[1:32:18] God has proven that." And that faith
[1:32:21] reaches a hold of it and brings it down
[1:32:23] to you. And now you have a reality.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:32:35] two people can come in. You know the
[1:32:37] night I gave my life to Christ, my best
[1:32:40] friend was right beside me.
[1:32:44] We did everything together.
[1:32:49] Within one week, I was still hungering
[1:32:51] for God.
[1:32:53] Within one week, he was at a dance
[1:32:57] and in the arms of some girl.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; And as months went by, he continued that
[1:33:03] direction. We were such close buddies.
[1:33:05] We lived together, roommed together.
[1:33:09] We had all of our enjoyment together.
[1:33:15] And at 35 years old, he was built he was
[1:33:18] built like a wrestler.
[1:33:20] Just an incredibly strong. At 15 years
[1:33:23] old, he was carrying green railroad ties
[1:33:27] and loading them. At 15 years old,
[1:33:30] he was so strong.
[1:33:34] He was very quiet. And he used to say,
[1:33:35] he said, "You do the talking and I'll
[1:33:37] hit them."
[1:33:40] to anybody he had, I'd feel sorry for
[1:33:42] them.
[1:33:44] It just real quiet. Became a truck
[1:33:46] driver. Came home at
[1:33:49] one evening
[1:33:52] and uh his wife or the woman he had or
[1:33:56] whatever it was
[1:33:58] uh he she said, "Well, I'll fix you
[1:34:00] something to eat." And he just he said,
[1:34:01] "Well, I'm not too hungry." He had a
[1:34:03] sandwich and just went up and laid on
[1:34:05] the sofa and his heart just stopped.
[1:34:09] 35
[1:34:10] in a prime of health. His heart just
[1:34:14] stopped. I talked to his brother after
[1:34:17] they did an autopsy and the doctor said
[1:34:19] there was nothing wrong. His heart just
[1:34:22] stopped.
[1:34:30] I've always been very thankful for the
[1:34:32] grace of God
[1:34:35] that the next week I kept hungering for
[1:34:38] the realities of God.
[1:34:44] Your life here is very uncertain.
[1:34:48] You think you have it and you you've got
[1:34:51] plans. And I'm here to announce to you
[1:34:54] today,
[1:34:56] it is not. This life is not a reality.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; This life is real. It's not real.
[1:35:06] And when it passes and when you pass
[1:35:08] from it and then we enter into the place
[1:35:11] that God has ordained, the Bible also
[1:35:14] tells us of the rewards that God has
[1:35:19] given or God has promised rewards. We
[1:35:23] want to live a life and uh brother
[1:35:24] Brandham said we should be thinking
[1:35:26] about that. So he said here that we
[1:35:30] can't comprehend it because it's a human
[1:35:32] mind. He's got to have the mind of God
[1:35:35] in him to understand godly things.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; In God's covenant with Abraham, he said,
[1:35:42] "It's such a little thing. How little
[1:35:45] finite minds can try to comprehend the
[1:35:49] infinite mind of God."
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; I think we need a balance. We do need a
[1:35:58] balance between this life,
[1:36:01] this world and the world to come. I
[1:36:06] think we need to have a balance between
[1:36:08] the needs of this natural life as it
[1:36:11] relates to daily life and the fullness
[1:36:14] of the life to come because the things
[1:36:16] which are not seen are eternal.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Are we all right?
[1:36:25] Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was speaking of uh in
[1:36:30] the unfailing realities of the living
[1:36:32] God and he said there's so many precious
[1:36:34] brethren here and uh that we are
[1:36:37] grateful to God that has given given the
[1:36:41] Holy Ghost to these various brethren. He
[1:36:44] said and it's begin to be a talk among
[1:36:47] us. They're in their local church said
[1:36:50] it's begin to be a talk about among us.
[1:36:52] Oh my,
[1:36:55] it revive us to a spot that we'll go to
[1:36:58] searching, hungering,
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; and pulling for the realities of God.
[1:37:04] God is a reality.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; So he was speaking, here's people here
[1:37:09] and there's a reviving going on and
[1:37:11] they're, you know, we're speaking about
[1:37:12] the infilling of the Holy Spirit and he
[1:37:14] said it set up a a a movement. And it
[1:37:17] set up a a revival amongst them to the
[1:37:21] spot where we are searching and
[1:37:23] hungering and pulling for the realities
[1:37:26] of God. And and God is a reality. And I
[1:37:29] said as I read that, I said, "God, let
[1:37:32] this congregation of Cloverdale Bible
[1:37:35] Way. Let them leave this building this
[1:37:39] morning. And I pray that you will be uh
[1:37:42] so gripped that your mind will be
[1:37:46] consumed not with the burdens of this
[1:37:48] life. We can be consumed with that.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; We can be consumed with all of the
[1:37:54] things of this life, but let us be
[1:37:56] consumed with the things which are
[1:37:59] unseen, the things which are realities,
[1:38:02] or consumed with that which will bring
[1:38:04] us to the reality.
[1:38:12] Brother Brandham speaks of God
[1:38:15] allowing his son and permitting him to
[1:38:17] hang between heaven and earth.
[1:38:21] And he said
[1:38:23] in the message, "Go tell my disciples,
[1:38:26] hanging there between heaven and earth,
[1:38:29] crying." Think of it now. Crying, "I
[1:38:33] thirst.
[1:38:34] I thirst, he says. And he even turned
[1:38:37] water to wine. The very creator of water
[1:38:42] standing there screaming for water.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; No wonder Jesus could look at the
[1:38:49] suffering of the cross
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; with joy.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Because he saw what it would attain.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; He saw what it was going to do. He saw
[1:39:00] that this purpose of his life, he came
[1:39:02] to be a redeemer and he'd be doing the
[1:39:04] redeeming act right there. And that the
[1:39:07] cross was not a reality. It was just
[1:39:10] there for time. The suffering was not a
[1:39:12] reality. It was just for a moment of
[1:39:15] time. And this is what I must do because
[1:39:17] I am claiming a reality.
[1:39:20] I'm purchasing a people. I'm purchasing
[1:39:24] my own my bride uh the body of Jesus
[1:39:27] Christ. I'm purchasing them. And so with
[1:39:30] joy, he went to the cross because the
[1:39:33] cross was not the reality.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; What he was purchasing
[1:39:38] you
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; that are seated here today purchasing
[1:39:43] you
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; a reality.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; And so we as his body do not want to
[1:39:50] become consumed.
[1:39:56] Quite a number of you are being you have
[1:39:58] graduated and you're we'll have
[1:40:01] graduating ceremonies and different
[1:40:04] things taking place and gatherings.
[1:40:10] Don't call them a party
[1:40:13] if you have a gathering. So we want to
[1:40:15] gather and I want to thank God that he
[1:40:18] allowed me to live.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; I want to thank God for the testimony he
[1:40:22] allowed me to leave. Some of those kids
[1:40:24] I'll maybe never see again.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Some of some of my girls
[1:40:32] went to I think a 20 or 25 year
[1:40:38] celebration.
[1:40:41] Young men and young ladies and one young
[1:40:43] man walked up.
[1:40:45] He's not young anymore.
[1:40:48] Baldhead had lost most of his hair and
[1:40:51] put on a lot of weight.
[1:40:53] and another lady, one of the girls they
[1:40:56] went to school with. You know what the
[1:40:58] question was? Are you still the same?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Are you still the same?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; I had a preacher's daughter.
[1:41:15] I lived in her home as a vagabond kid as
[1:41:18] I was shuffled from place to place. I
[1:41:21] hardly knew sometime where I was going
[1:41:23] to be staying. And I was staying in this
[1:41:25] preacher's home and he had five
[1:41:27] children.
[1:41:30] I'm talking about real things, friends,
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; but not realities.
[1:41:35] This is passing.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; And she decided to the world was what
[1:41:41] she wanted.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; And she lived in the world and
[1:41:47] enjoyed life.
[1:41:49] lived in the Okonogan over here. Went
[1:41:52] down into the on the US side to a dance
[1:41:56] to have a great time and coming back.
[1:41:59] She's in the back seat and the the car
[1:42:02] left the road and passed right through a
[1:42:05] high tension telephone pole, took about
[1:42:08] a 5-ft section of the pole out, went
[1:42:11] into a farmer's orchard, flipped over on
[1:42:14] its lid, and she's thrown out of the
[1:42:16] car, part out of the car, and part of
[1:42:19] her body, lower body's in the car. And I
[1:42:22] don't know what happened to the two in
[1:42:23] the front seat. And they didn't find
[1:42:25] them for several hours because they were
[1:42:27] down over this embankment and couldn't
[1:42:28] be seen from the road. They finally
[1:42:30] found her. She was a young girl. She was
[1:42:34] just in her 20s.
[1:42:36] She was beautiful.
[1:42:38] But from that day on, she walked on two
[1:42:41] crutches
[1:42:42] like this the rest of her days
[1:42:47] and committed suicide here in New
[1:42:48] Westminster. jumped out of a building,
[1:42:53] a preacher's daughter that I lived I
[1:42:55] lived in their home.
[1:42:58] Say, is this the kind of story? This is
[1:43:01] this is what happened. And I look at
[1:43:03] that and I can tell you her life. She
[1:43:07] says, you know, I'm going to live this
[1:43:09] kind of life. That's not a reality.
[1:43:12] There's nothing real about it. People
[1:43:14] think I'm having real fun. I'm having
[1:43:16] You're not having real fun. That devil's
[1:43:19] got plans for you. He's got plans to
[1:43:22] ring every ounce of life out of you.
[1:43:24] He's got plans to send you to hell.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; That's his plan. That's his program.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; And did she hear the gospel? Thousands
[1:43:34] of words of the gospel. Thousands of
[1:43:38] realities.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Thus saith the Lord,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; but failed to give herself to it.
[1:43:53] Brother Brandham says that the new earth
[1:43:55] will put on its new Eden again.
[1:44:00] We're going green,
[1:44:02] so we can have a whole lot less
[1:44:04] pollution in the air. We're going green.
[1:44:08] I talked to someone the other day,
[1:44:11] Brother Andrew. It was you, I believe,
[1:44:14] and he's in a Starbucks or someplace and
[1:44:17] having a cup of coffee and they got a
[1:44:19] wooden stick.
[1:44:21] You might say, "Is this a gospel?" This
[1:44:22] is right in line with what I'm
[1:44:24] preaching. And uh so he's stirring is
[1:44:27] stirring his coffee with the stick and a
[1:44:30] woman right next to him says, "Well, let
[1:44:32] me use your stick for saving trees.
[1:44:41] And then you open up your newspaper and
[1:44:43] you got a you got a you got a goodsized
[1:44:45] tree right there in the advertising
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; and throw it in the garbage.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; We're saving trees.
[1:44:54] I tell you, God's going to save the
[1:44:57] trees.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; God is making, he says in the closing of
[1:45:01] the scripture, "Behold, I make a new
[1:45:04] heaven.
[1:45:06] and a new earth
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; for the old earth
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; which has been is passed away.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; And God will destroy those who destroy
[1:45:17] the earth according to the scripture. I
[1:45:20] tell you, God is going to go green.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; God's the one who's going to restore it
[1:45:25] back again. And when Jesus hung between
[1:45:28] heaven and earth and his blood spilled
[1:45:30] on the earth and he was crying out, "I
[1:45:32] thirst. I thirst. The creator of the
[1:45:35] tree that he hung on.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; The creator of the iron that was in the
[1:45:39] nails. The creator of the air he was
[1:45:42] breathing and his lungs crying out, "I
[1:45:45] thirst. I thirst. Father, forgive them.
[1:45:47] They don't know what they do." And his
[1:45:48] blood spilling to the ground. He was
[1:45:51] claiming this earth.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; He was claiming for you a reality.
[1:45:55] You'll have a new heaven and a new earth
[1:45:57] to dwell on. And oh friends, friends,
[1:46:00] I'm not just enthused about this. I am
[1:46:03] so I'm so happy. I'm so inspired because
[1:46:07] there's something deep within me that
[1:46:09] tells me uh although I'm not worthy
[1:46:12] that purchase of his blood is taking me
[1:46:15] to that and that life is a reality
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; and that's what we have to be looking
[1:46:22] towards and that's what we have to be
[1:46:24] spending our life
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; towards.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Help me. I'm trying to move through
[1:46:31] here. Yeah.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Says, "When Christ came to become man
[1:46:37] here on earth and to be a kinsman
[1:46:39] redeemer, he redeemed man. To everything
[1:46:43] he lost in the fall, Christ restored it
[1:46:46] to him in the kinsman redeemership.
[1:46:50] Everything the human race lost in Adam
[1:46:53] was redeemed when Christ, God himself,
[1:46:56] became kinfolk with the human race and
[1:46:59] redeemed it back to his maker. All that
[1:47:02] was lost, he redeemed back again.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that Calvary wasn't a
[1:47:08] reality.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; That was a reality.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; One of the greater realities of God.
[1:47:16] and a new earth will put on its Eden
[1:47:19] beauty again.
[1:47:24] So I say the world
[1:47:28] that Jesus came to and was in and lived
[1:47:30] in
[1:47:32] and that's why he didn't he didn't he
[1:47:35] didn't put any emphasis on it because it
[1:47:37] wasn't real.
[1:47:42] He said, "Then sin and suffering, listen
[1:47:45] to what the prophet of God declares. Sin
[1:47:48] and suffering and everything must come
[1:47:50] to a place where it has no existence."
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Sin and suffering must come to a place
[1:47:58] where it has no existence. And even
[1:48:00] science will tell you a reality is that
[1:48:02] which exists. And a prophet of God is
[1:48:05] declaring in scientific language sin and
[1:48:08] suffering. Think of all the suffering of
[1:48:11] humanity. Sin and suffering must come to
[1:48:15] a place of non-existence.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; You might be sick here.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; You might be afflicted. You might have
[1:48:24] some
[1:48:27] some hurt. You might have some pain. You
[1:48:30] might have some inner turmoil. You might
[1:48:33] have something that you say, "Oh, God,
[1:48:35] when when will this end?" I can tell you
[1:48:37] one thing. It is not a reality. And that
[1:48:41] too shall pass because only that which
[1:48:44] is eternal that cannot pass into that
[1:48:47] land where there will be no sin,
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; no death, no crying, no tears, no pain,
[1:48:55] no suffering. That is a place that he
[1:48:58] came and purchased.
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; He said because it had a beginning.
[1:49:09] There was a time when there was no
[1:49:10] sickness, no sin, no sorrow, no death,
[1:49:13] and then it came by perversion. So all
[1:49:16] the perversion must end.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; And all that has had had the was at the
[1:49:25] beginning has to end so that the eternal
[1:49:29] can ever exist.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope that you can as as I studied
[1:49:36] this, friends, I became so gripped. I
[1:49:38] had to come out and talk to my wife
[1:49:40] because I just had to declare all of
[1:49:43] these things, these things that we
[1:49:45] become, you know, that are that uh uh
[1:49:49] possess our our mind and our being and
[1:49:51] our concerns and these burdens and and
[1:49:54] whatever more. These things are not
[1:49:57] reality.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; They're not real.
[1:50:01] So it's not real but it's sure
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; sure on my mind
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; the things which are seen are temporal.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Don't forget it. Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; He says that's the reason it's totally
[1:50:23] impossible for any person to ever be
[1:50:25] saved outside of the new birth because
[1:50:28] men are born again of the spirit of God
[1:50:30] and become a part of God.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Their existence is eternal as God is
[1:50:36] eternal.
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:38] [Applause]
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Their existence
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; is eternal. There's a part of you, my
[1:50:44] brother, my sister, and all that are
[1:50:46] streaming. Let me tell you, there's a
[1:50:48] part of you that has an existence. And I
[1:50:51] can say concerning that existence, it's
[1:50:53] as eternal as God is eternal.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. People who study and practice
[1:51:00] yoga, they will tell you that you know
[1:51:03] uh just in my language that they try and
[1:51:06] get in contact with the universe and and
[1:51:09] somehow feel the vibrations and moving
[1:51:13] through their body and they talk about a
[1:51:15] consciousness and and and and it's semi
[1:51:19] quasi spiritual language but it's not a
[1:51:23] reality because it's it's from the human
[1:51:26] perspective and but they do speak about
[1:51:29] the, you know, the great and about God
[1:51:32] and and so on and so forth. But I tell
[1:51:34] you what, friends, you say, "I'm not
[1:51:36] ridiculing them. I'm not even speaking
[1:51:38] negatively about them. I can only tell
[1:51:41] you that they need and they have all
[1:51:43] kinds of prophets. There's prophets. The
[1:51:44] Muhammadans have a prophet. Mormons have
[1:51:46] a prophet. All kinds of people in India
[1:51:48] have prophets. They've had all kinds of
[1:51:50] prophets that have walked over there.
[1:51:52] Israel has prophets. But I can tell you
[1:51:54] a prophet, the only one I'm interested
[1:51:56] in that can say, "Thus saith the Lord,
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; and let the God who spoke the word, and
[1:52:03] if he said, if I have told you the
[1:52:05] truth, let that God come forth now
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; and prove that he is God."
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Friends, I trust that's why you're in
[1:52:15] this meeting.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And humanly speaking and spiritually
[1:52:22] speaking and if you're even a thinking
[1:52:25] person, that is the first time you have
[1:52:28] a person that's actually bringing
[1:52:31] bringing on the scene an absolute
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; and an absolute is a reality.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; And so now here a prophet is standing.
[1:52:40] I'm only using one example of literally
[1:52:43] thousands. Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Just before brother Brand calls Mr.
[1:52:49] Mitchell out, he says, "There's another
[1:52:51] man." Another man was sitting right
[1:52:52] there. He said, "And and you got you're
[1:52:55] real nervous." He said, "You got a
[1:52:58] trouble in your throat."
[1:53:02] That didn't sound like something
[1:53:04] profound,
[1:53:06] but he says, "The reason why is because
[1:53:09] you're a minister."
[1:53:12] And he says, "And you feel real nervous
[1:53:14] right now. And the reason why you're
[1:53:15] nervous is because you have an
[1:53:17] appointment and you got to get out of
[1:53:19] this meeting and get to that
[1:53:21] appointment." Listen, friends. And your
[1:53:24] name, Reverend Mr. Smith,
[1:53:27] go
[1:53:30] now. Now we have a reality.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Now we have an absolute.
[1:53:36] And that is why the messenger said so
[1:53:38] many times, is that the truth?
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Raise your hand if that's the truth.
[1:53:46] Because the truth is an absolute.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; That was God's channel for bringing a
[1:53:56] reality to a person who's experienced
[1:53:59] something that's not real.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Say, "What do you mean? I'm sick with
[1:54:03] cancer. I'm dying. The doctor said, "I
[1:54:05] haven't got I haven't got a hope to
[1:54:07] live." And that's not a reality. No,
[1:54:09] it's not a reality because it's passing.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; But if you believe God's word, you can
[1:54:15] reach through by faith.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; I I've run out of time and I have pages
[1:54:24] left. I'll have to take probably another
[1:54:26] service. But that the scripture says the
[1:54:30] uh message of heroes of faith in the
[1:54:33] 11th chapter of Hebrews starts out by
[1:54:36] saying faith is the substance
[1:54:40] of things hoped for. It is the substance
[1:54:43] of things hoped for. And then it goes on
[1:54:45] and says through faith through faith we
[1:54:50] understand that the worlds were formed
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; through faith. Because in the very
[1:54:55] beginning it says, "And God said,"
[1:54:58] Brother Brandham says, "And God said,
[1:54:59] let there be light." If a fog came, it
[1:55:03] wasn't God speaking.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; If God says something, then it has to
[1:55:12] happen that way. Let the earth bring
[1:55:14] forth. And it did.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Let the waters bring forth. And it did.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the reality was speaking.
[1:55:23] And then the external came on the scene
[1:55:26] that we could see and we could touch in
[1:55:28] our senses. That which your senses
[1:55:31] declare is not a reality. Said, "Well, I
[1:55:34] saw it with my eyes." People asked me
[1:55:36] when I saw it. The pillar of fire, the
[1:55:38] angel of the Lord came right into the
[1:55:40] car. Said, "Did you see it?" I said,
[1:55:42] "No, if I could, I wouldn't have
[1:55:43] believed it
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; because my eyes, your eyes have not been
[1:55:50] given you to declare spiritual things."
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; But in your soul, you have a realm that
[1:55:58] can believe God.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; And faith is not an emotion. Faith is a
[1:56:03] quiet conviction of the truth.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; God said it.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; I believe it. And that settles it.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; That's faith.
[1:56:14] [Applause]
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have a feeling. You
[1:56:18] don't have to have a jiggle. You don't
[1:56:20] have to have a goosebump. You don't have
[1:56:22] to have a chill down your spine. You
[1:56:24] simply have to have a confession out of
[1:56:26] your mouth. God spoke that
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; and I believe what he said
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; and he confirmed it by a messenger in
[1:56:36] this hour. And we've seen it happen. And
[1:56:39] I know that it's God's word.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; So through faith
[1:56:46] and by faith Abel
[1:56:48] and by faith Enoch.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; And by faith Noah
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; and by faith Abraham
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; and by faith he sojourned.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; And through faith also Sarah received.
[1:57:00] And these all died in the faith. By
[1:57:03] faith Abraham again. By faith Isaac. By
[1:57:06] faith Jacob. By faith, Joseph. By faith,
[1:57:10] Moses. By faith, he forsook Egypt.
[1:57:12] Through faith, he kept the Passover. By
[1:57:15] faith, they passed through the Red Sea.
[1:57:17] By faith, the walls of Jericho came
[1:57:19] down. By faith, the the harlot Rahab.
[1:57:25] And I say, by faith, a bride of Jesus
[1:57:28] Christ has risen up in Leodysia.
[1:57:31] By faith, we heard the word. By faith,
[1:57:35] we have accepted it. We have believed it
[1:57:38] and it is that belief that's made the
[1:57:40] change.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; We don't say we have a reality because I
[1:57:48] believe we don't have a reality because
[1:57:49] I had a change. That's not the proof of
[1:57:51] a reality. That's what I said. Many
[1:57:53] people change. Many people start a good
[1:57:56] life.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; My wife's daddy
[1:58:01] in his early days and a young man, he
[1:58:03] liked to gamble.
[1:58:06] So he was gambling and
[1:58:09] they smoked and drank and whatever more
[1:58:11] and he's gambling
[1:58:13] starting out a young businessman
[1:58:16] and uh the two older children than my
[1:58:20] wife she's the youngest. So his son and
[1:58:24] daughter came down
[1:58:26] in the morning and said
[1:58:29] what what was going on last night?
[1:58:32] What was that racket?
[1:58:35] He just said that's it.
[1:58:37] He was a very strong willed man. That
[1:58:39] was end. No more gambling.
[1:58:44] No more crowing in the house cuz my his
[1:58:47] family was first. That's end. End of it.
[1:58:49] Was that a reality? No. Wasn't a
[1:58:51] reality. He just said, "My kids don't
[1:58:54] need that kind of a home. They don't
[1:58:55] need that kind of a life and I'm
[1:58:57] quitting."
[1:58:58] Some people say, "You know what? I'm
[1:59:00] killing myself with these cigarettes.
[1:59:02] I'm going to quit." So they quit. That's
[1:59:04] not reality. They just did it for their
[1:59:07] health.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; But then the next person hears the word
[1:59:09] of God. They actually hear the word of
[1:59:13] God. They don't know what the changes
[1:59:15] are going to be.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; The changes aren't even in their mind.
[1:59:18] They just hear the word of God. They
[1:59:20] know God is speaking to my soul.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; And they know I hunger for this kind of
[1:59:27] life. I can't comprehend it. I can't
[1:59:29] understand it. It desire it.
[1:59:33] [Applause]
[1:59:35] I don't know where it'll take me.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it'll cost in my life,
[1:59:40] but that isn't even in my mind. I hunger
[1:59:42] for these things.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; I look across this congregation, I see
[1:59:46] one after the other after the other all
[1:59:48] across this congregation who left the
[1:59:50] most beloved loved ones
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; because they were separated from them by
[1:59:56] accepting and receiving the word of the
[1:59:58] Lord in this hour. And then they
[2:00:00] believed that and that spirit came upon
[2:00:02] the word they believed.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; The light sprung forth and changes begin
[2:00:07] to happen.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Those changes are a reality
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; because they came by the word of God.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; The change was a result. The change was
[2:00:18] not a cause.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; The change is a result.
[2:00:26] Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; So by faith
[2:00:33] and by faith
[2:00:36] the Bible says that they obtained a good
[2:00:40] report.
[2:00:43] And I'm going to
[2:00:46] just close now.
[2:00:52] I have a little thing I want to read for
[2:00:54] you.
[2:00:58] This is in
[2:01:01] when brother Brandham spoke these words.
[2:01:03] He had
[2:01:11] he had uh
[2:01:14] maybe four four more hours of life that
[2:01:19] he preaching life that he was going to
[2:01:20] preach.
[2:01:22] This is in things that are to be. Things
[2:01:25] that are to be.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "We build a hospital. It's ever
[2:01:33] so good." That's fine. Talked about
[2:01:36] building schools, building hospitals. He
[2:01:38] said that was not the program.
[2:01:42] We build a hospital that's ever so good
[2:01:44] in practice with the best medicine we
[2:01:46] got and thousands die in it daily. But
[2:01:50] oh my, in the kingdom of God, there is
[2:01:53] no death.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; There is no sorrow. Amen. There's no
[2:01:58] need for these things of the world. But
[2:02:01] we've passed
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; from this thing into the realities of
[2:02:08] God.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Said, "They're all right, but we've
[2:02:12] passed from this."
[2:02:14] Not that we don't not that there's
[2:02:17] anything negative about a hospital or a
[2:02:19] school or those things. Those are part
[2:02:21] of this life. They're part of, you know,
[2:02:28] part of our daily movement through this
[2:02:30] life. But we need to see ourselves in a
[2:02:33] whole different light. We need to see
[2:02:35] ourselves as passing through.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; I'm just passing through. This world is
[2:02:40] not my home.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through. My treasures
[2:02:45] are laid up
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; somewhere.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; They say beyond the blue. And then he
[2:02:49] says, we've passed from this thing into
[2:02:52] the realities of God where we struggle
[2:02:55] so hard to try to find through science
[2:02:58] and more scientific we get, the more
[2:03:00] death we bring on ourselves. We're
[2:03:03] fighting a losing battle there. So turn
[2:03:06] loose of it. This is my concluding
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; phrase to you today. Turn loose of it
[2:03:14] and by faith
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; believe Jesus Christ, the son of God
[2:03:18] tonight and accept him. He's the one.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look where Jesus sits on the
[2:03:25] right hand of God tonight, ever living
[2:03:28] to make intercession on our confession
[2:03:31] of what we believe his word to be the
[2:03:35] truth."
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, I'm I'm not believing
[2:03:41] this message because
[2:03:44] uh there was nothing else to believe.
[2:03:46] I'm not believing it because my mind
[2:03:49] said, you know what, that sounds all
[2:03:51] right. Or that sounds reasonable.
[2:03:56] Why are you believing it?
[2:04:01] Well,
[2:04:03] I'll tell you what, friends.
[2:04:05] There's many times perhaps we would have
[2:04:07] chosen if if it had been up to us, we
[2:04:09] said, you know what? I'm going to live
[2:04:12] an I want an easier life.
[2:04:15] I want an easier life. We haven't been
[2:04:17] called to a picnic.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; We've been called to a battle.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; A battle royal.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; A a real mortal struggle.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; That's what we've been called to. In
[2:04:30] fact, as we've been called to, it's not
[2:04:32] easy to just keep looking to the unseen.
[2:04:35] Oh my, I mean, you know, I could even
[2:04:38] just start preaching now, but it's 20
[2:04:40] to1. And I want to close right away.
[2:04:43] A Abraham, the Bible says that they
[2:04:46] looked to the unseen. Moses, he looked
[2:04:48] to the unseen. I mean, these are men
[2:04:51] that were not even going to they were
[2:04:53] not even going to physically
[2:04:56] materially
[2:04:58] inherit what was promised to them.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Says, "I give you this land." Abraham
[2:05:03] never got the land. How would you like
[2:05:05] to be called to something and never
[2:05:06] actually obtain it and never get it in
[2:05:08] your hands and live your entire life
[2:05:11] that way? That's the faith of Abraham.
[2:05:14] And because Abraham had that kind of
[2:05:16] trust, that kind of faith, God said,
[2:05:18] "You're my friend."
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's worth a whole lifetime. That's
[2:05:23] worth a whole lifetime of struggle. Have
[2:05:25] God come down and say, "You're my
[2:05:27] friend. You believed me."
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with this material
[2:05:33] thing. They had struggles and arguments
[2:05:35] with with uh, you know, Lot servants and
[2:05:38] and all kinds of things and other armies
[2:05:40] that were around. That's just a part of
[2:05:42] life.
[2:05:44] We have that.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; I pray that today, this is my earnest
[2:05:52] desire that something has been said that
[2:05:55] causes you
[2:05:57] to have clarity of sight and an inner
[2:06:00] vision that will see those things that
[2:06:03] are actually real.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; Those things that actually do exist.
[2:06:13] your life,
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; your body, your theophony,
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; your home.
[2:06:24] As brother Tom preached on
[2:06:27] Wednesday night, and I so enjoyed the
[2:06:30] service, this land is your land.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; This is your place.
[2:06:38] I go to prepare a place
[2:06:41] for you.
[2:06:44] And there has to be and my whole purpose
[2:06:47] of this message this morning, church,
[2:06:50] Cloverdale Bible Way, you people that
[2:06:53] come here, you come here Sunday morning
[2:06:55] to hear the word of God. And by God's
[2:06:58] help and grace, I've sought with
[2:07:00] everything that's in me to bring the
[2:07:02] word that God would have you here today.
[2:07:05] Do not go from this place and let Satan
[2:07:09] through the world. This is Satan's Eden
[2:07:11] dictate everything to you. Uh, you know,
[2:07:14] he'll tell you, you know, how much time
[2:07:15] you have for your family and where
[2:07:17] you're going to go and what you're going
[2:07:18] to do and everything else and just keep
[2:07:20] keep you on his treadmill. It'd be nice
[2:07:22] to announce to him, you know what,
[2:07:24] devil? I'm getting off your treadmill.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to let my life be
[2:07:28] run by my inner conviction.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you abundantly and
[2:07:38] come this evening and be ready for the
[2:07:41] word. And I I I don't want to just
[2:07:44] close. Maybe we have the musicians come,
[2:07:46] please. I I don't want to just close
[2:07:48] without giving you an invitation.
[2:07:52] And the invitation is this.
[2:07:57] join me
[2:07:59] as I seek also to to move in the same
[2:08:03] direction.
[2:08:05] I think it would be good to take a hold
[2:08:09] of our agenda
[2:08:12] and say my agenda needs adjustment.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; I need to see more clearly
[2:08:22] the unseen.
[2:08:24] Give me, oh God, and fix my vision on
[2:08:28] the things that are eternal.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Let my thoughts and my mind be consumed
[2:08:34] with that.
[2:08:40] Even I, my wife, we have wonderful
[2:08:44] health,
[2:08:46] but we pray for things in the physical
[2:08:48] realm.
[2:08:52] We have things that we pray for
[2:08:53] earnestly. You have things.
[2:08:57] I need to say to you today, those
[2:09:01] things are not realities.
[2:09:04] it has come along in this life and we
[2:09:07] can say well because I'm getting older
[2:09:09] or because I did this or because I had
[2:09:11] this kind of accident or I you know this
[2:09:14] happened to me and and and now I've got
[2:09:16] this injury and I am this way
[2:09:20] and it it may be you you may you may be
[2:09:22] the way that that way the rest of your
[2:09:24] life but I have to I have to say to you
[2:09:27] I cannot look at that infirmity and say
[2:09:30] that's real.
[2:09:35] I'm talking about personal things.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; You know, I I have to be very personal
[2:09:42] with you. You know, my I my wife wants
[2:09:45] to travel with me when I go to meetings.
[2:09:47] He said, "You need me and I need to be
[2:09:50] there. I need to have your clothes
[2:09:53] ready. I need to be with you. I need to,
[2:09:55] you know, when you have need a little
[2:09:57] bit of lunch or something to eat because
[2:09:59] she just monitors everything and have
[2:10:01] your suits ready and and and watch and
[2:10:04] make sure make sure that you have a rest
[2:10:06] and so on and need to be there. But she
[2:10:09] doesn't have a balance. Many of you
[2:10:10] people know that, but most of you don't
[2:10:12] or many of you don't. They they they
[2:10:15] discovered at the University of British
[2:10:17] Columbia that that her balance system,
[2:10:19] her mechanism, balance mechanism somehow
[2:10:22] was totally destroyed and doesn't exist
[2:10:24] in her body.
[2:10:26] I stand here today, I say,
[2:10:30] as far as God is concerned, she's not
[2:10:33] going to be that way across the river.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; She's not going to be that way where I
[2:10:38] look into the unseen. That's that's not
[2:10:42] I don't see a woman that has no balance.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; I see a woman that has is exactly as God
[2:10:49] ordained it to be.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; And so I'm here believing. I don't I
[2:10:54] don't want to even wait for that. I'm
[2:10:55] believing for it now. God who gave that
[2:10:57] balance system in the first place can
[2:10:59] replace that today before she walks out
[2:11:02] those doors.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; I I say that that is not a reality.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; The reality, what is the reality? You
[2:11:10] say the reality is the creative power of
[2:11:13] almighty God by the word of God that can
[2:11:16] give it back.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; That's the reality. And I'm seeking here
[2:11:21] that my faith can reach out and take a
[2:11:23] hold of that thing.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Take a hold of that promise and bring it
[2:11:27] down into our existence and and that we
[2:11:30] can experience it.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? Amen.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Let this whole church in the name of
[2:11:37] Jesus Christ believe for the true
[2:11:40] realities. And let us say with the
[2:11:42] messenger of this hour, we have passed
[2:11:45] on into the realities of God.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; We hunger and thirst for that.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you, precious people.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Let's stand and bow our heads, please.
[2:12:01] If you'd like to be included in a prayer
[2:12:02] and you wish to raise your hand
[2:12:06] just to identify what's in your heart,
[2:12:08] we'll pray together.
[2:12:13] Father,
[2:12:16] how true.
[2:12:18] Truth. Truth.
[2:12:20] Your word is truth.
[2:12:23] Jesus, you said that you came you came
[2:12:26] to earth to testify of the truth.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; You are truth. Oh God, and I hold in my
[2:12:34] hand the word of God and truly it is a a
[2:12:38] a reality.
[2:12:40] Almighty God, you are the self-existent
[2:12:42] one.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; You are real. We thank you, Father, that
[2:12:46] you have made yourself real. Oh, open
[2:12:49] our eyes and open our understanding that
[2:12:51] we may grasp more perfectly your will.
[2:12:54] Lord, how we thank you for the message
[2:12:56] that you sent in this hour and the
[2:12:58] messenger that has declared it. And for
[2:13:00] the first time in history, have we had
[2:13:02] anything of this nature where someone
[2:13:04] could say, "If God be God and if God has
[2:13:09] spoken these words, then let that God
[2:13:11] come." And you did come, oh God. You did
[2:13:14] come. You're the God of Abraham, Isaac,
[2:13:17] and Jacob. You're the God of the living
[2:13:19] and not of the dead, as our Lord Jesus
[2:13:21] said. You're the God that has created,
[2:13:23] and you're the God that has brought us
[2:13:25] forth to this time. You have a purpose.
[2:13:28] You have a design. And I pray that we
[2:13:31] will fulfill that. Lord, let every man,
[2:13:33] woman, and child within the range of my
[2:13:37] my speaking today and those that are
[2:13:39] streaming, I pray you'll go into the
[2:13:42] rooms where they are. And may the very
[2:13:44] presence of Almighty God, sweep down and
[2:13:48] permeate them and right here, Lord,
[2:13:51] today may there be a may there be a
[2:13:53] general reception, Lord. see receiving
[2:13:56] you saying, "Oh God, come and do thee
[2:13:59] abundantly, exceedingly abundantly above

[2:22:05] [Music]
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; how we love you, Lord.
[2:22:17] Father, words escape me right now, Lord.
[2:22:20] But all we can do is just praise you and
[2:22:22] thank you, dear God, for this amazing
[2:22:24] grace that you've given to us, Lord.
[2:22:27] Grace, the grace upon grace that's been
[2:22:30] poured upon our lives. Father, you're
[2:22:33] unveiling yourself before us in this end
[2:22:35] time hour. You've opened up our eyes,
[2:22:38] dear God. Think of the multitudes, Lord
[2:22:41] Jesus, that have blinded eyes. Ones
[2:22:44] we've testified to and they can't see
[2:22:46] this great Jesus Christ has been
[2:22:48] unveiled before us. But Lord God, you've
[2:22:52] unveiled yourself before us, Lord.
[2:22:53] You've called us to this great mystery,
[2:22:55] Lord. And Father, I want to say thank
[2:22:58] you. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord,
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; that every area of our lives, we could
[2:23:03] praise you. We could thank you. We could
[2:23:05] worship you, Lord. that we could seek
[2:23:08] first the kingdom of God and and your
[2:23:10] righteousness, Father. And all these
[2:23:12] things, Lord, that are around us. All
[2:23:14] these things that, Lord, seem real to
[2:23:16] us, you though they're not realities,
[2:23:18] Lord, you said they'd be added unto us,
[2:23:20] Lord. If we need healing in our body,
[2:23:22] Lord, if we seek first the kingdom of
[2:23:24] God, it'll be added unto us, Father. If
[2:23:27] we need salvation for our loved ones,
[2:23:29] dear God, that will be added unto us,
[2:23:32] Lord. If we need a job, Lord, if we need
[2:23:34] financial needs, Lord, you said you
[2:23:36] would add that unto us, Lord. But you
[2:23:39] said to seek first the kingdom of God.
[2:23:41] And Lord, that's our desire. That's our
[2:23:43] hunger, Lord. How we may please you in
[2:23:45] this hour that is so late, Father. And
[2:23:48] I'm praying, dear God, that we could
[2:23:50] just set aside the cares of life, the
[2:23:52] busyiness of life, dear Lord, and to
[2:23:55] seek you first, to seek your will for
[2:23:57] our lives, Lord. What you would have us
[2:23:59] to do, Father. Lord, we so appreciate
[2:24:02] this service. We appreciate our pastor.
[2:24:05] We appreciate the attendance of the Holy
[2:24:07] Spirit, Lord. And Father God, just
[2:24:09] speaking to our hearts today. Lord, I
[2:24:12] pray that you'll go before us. Father,
[2:24:14] be with us this afternoon in our
[2:24:16] fellowship, the time that we would get
[2:24:18] rest and prepare our hearts for the
[2:24:19] service tonight. Lord, that once again
[2:24:22] that we can come and not to be casual,
[2:24:25] dear God, about this word that you've
[2:24:26] given to us, Father, but Lord, tonight
[2:24:29] as we approach you again, Brother Lance
[2:24:32] coming to bring your word. Father, help
[2:24:34] us be on the edge of our seat.
[2:24:37] Lord Jesus, there could be a night that
[2:24:39] one here that is needing salvation, dear
[2:24:42] God, that they would hear Jesus Christ
[2:24:44] speak to them. My children need
[2:24:47] salvation, Lord. Many here that need
[2:24:49] salvation. Many that are hungering and
[2:24:51] crying for salvation, Lord. And Father,
[2:24:53] you said they that hunger and thirst,
[2:24:56] Lord Jesus, they would be filled. So
[2:24:58] fill us tonight, dear God. All the
[2:25:01] things that we have need of, you're our
[2:25:02] provider. We love you, dear Lord Jesus.
[2:25:06] All that we have need of, dear God,
[2:25:07] you've already provided it for us, Lord.
[2:25:10] So, we're just waiting on you, Father.
[2:25:12] Father, for you to open up the windows
[2:25:13] of heaven and pour down that blessing
[2:25:15] that we wouldn't be able to contain it,
[2:25:17] Lord, but that we can just be released
[2:25:20] from this world, dear God. Be released
[2:25:22] into your presence and and freedom of
[2:25:25] worship and freedom of praise, dear God,
[2:25:27] to receive the revelation, dear God.
[2:25:29] You're just waiting to pour into our
[2:25:31] lives, Father. just help us to get
[2:25:34] aside, Lord, to quieten our spirits,
[2:25:36] Lord Jesus. Oh God, for you have
[2:25:39] something in store for us even tonight,
[2:25:41] even this afternoon, Lord. And so, dear
[2:25:44] God, we pray that you'll just anoint
[2:25:46] each one of us. And Father, as we
[2:25:48] prepare our hearts, Lord, as we prepare
[2:25:51] our hearts for more of you, strengthen
[2:25:53] Brother Ed, dear God, we're so thankful
[2:25:57] for the man of God. So thankful for a
[2:26:00] man who has held out, Lord, who has
[2:26:02] been, Lord, so uncompromising with your
[2:26:06] word. Father, holding the banner high,
[2:26:09] dear God.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; We see the testimony, dear God, that
[2:26:12] he's lived before us, the testimony of
[2:26:14] his dear wife. And Lord, we just pray
[2:26:16] that you'll meet their desires, that
[2:26:18] you'd meet their prayer requests, Lord,
[2:26:21] what they have asked for in privacy,
[2:26:23] dear God, that you would make it
[2:26:24] manifest, Father. Lord, we thank you for
[2:26:27] their lives. We thank you for your
[2:26:29] people. We just ask, dear God, that
[2:26:31] you'd go before us now. Walk with us,
[2:26:34] Lord. We want you to be our friend,
[2:26:36] Lord. You said you'd be a friend that
[2:26:39] stickketh closer than her brother. We
[2:26:41] thank you for it, Lord. Asking your
[2:26:43] blessings upon us now in the precious
[2:26:46] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:26:52] God bless you. All we can say is the
[2:26:54] best thing we can say. God bless you.
[2:26:57] and you greet one another and we'll see
[2:27:00] you this evening. Come early. Have a
[2:27:02] good seat. God bless you. You're
[2:27:05] dismissed.
