[0:03] salvation is very easy
[0:05] it's the story of redemption
[0:08] it's a story of windows
[0:10] of opportunity
[0:11] that every man took
[0:13] noah came with the ark and there was a
[0:15] door
[0:16] god sent the prophet there is a door and
[0:18] brad says when you receive the gift the
[0:20] god is sent in the day it opens up the
[0:22] age of golden opportunity
[0:26] but going to hell
[0:28] is harder than getting saved
[0:31] because for you to be lost it means that
[0:33] every window
[0:34] of opportunity you rejected
[0:37] it's not easy to do that
[0:40] right honestly in two days the same
[0:41] thing the very same thing we are given
[0:43] the opportunity because god cannot judge
[0:46] without first having or without first
[0:48] giving his warning
[0:50] if you told a certain person going down
[0:52] the road speeding stop
[0:55] and say there is a hole down the road
[0:56] there if you continue to speed you'll be
[0:58] killed and they say nonsense i know what
[1:00] i'm doing then you see the blood can be
[1:02] upon you
[1:04] because you have thoroughly warned them
[1:09] well god does the same thing by his word
[1:12] he thoroughly warns the people of
[1:13] uncoming judgment and shows his sign and
[1:16] wonders that's predicted in the bible
[1:18] for that age he shows them and the
[1:21] people just walk right over it it's not
[1:23] easy for a person to go to hell a man
[1:26] fights his way to hell
[1:38] a man fights his way to hell
[1:41] the first lie you ever told you know it
[1:43] was wrong the first cigarette you ever
[1:45] smoked you know that was wrong the first
[1:47] evil you did you know that was wrong but
[1:50] in your conscience something told you
[1:52] was wrong but you continually ran
[1:54] through the red light
[1:55] ran over the barricades you're reckless
[1:58] you want to do it anyhow to show that
[2:01] you're some big guy huh see but remember
[2:04] you fight your way to hell it is not
[2:07] easy to go to hell you have to reject
[2:09] truth
[2:10] and i'm not preaching hell tonight to
[2:11] scare anybody but i'm saying the way to
[2:13] hell is more difficult than the way to
[2:16] salvation salvation is one opportunity
[2:18] you take it hell is rejecting truth over
[2:21] and over and over again how many windows
[2:24] have you had if you've been raised in
[2:26] the church for 20 years i guarantee
[2:28] you've had a window at least every
[2:30] service how many windows are you
[2:33] rejecting to fight your way to hell
[2:41] you say that if i was in the day of
[2:42] jesus maybe i would have stood for him
[2:44] probably says that you have a more you
[2:46] have more of an opportunity to stand for
[2:48] him tonight than you would have back in
[2:51] those days because the opposition today
[2:54] is greater than it was then you say if i
[2:57] was with the disciples and i saw jesus
[2:58] christ in the flesh surely i would have
[3:00] stood for him but the opposition today
[3:03] the forces of hell today against the
[3:05] truth are harder there are more fierce
[3:07] today than then so if you serve god
[3:10] today and stand for him today that is a
[3:12] greater opportunity than the disciples
[3:15] what you have today is a much greater
[3:18] opportunity why won't you take it
