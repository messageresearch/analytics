[11:13] you just come and
[11:16] lead the church in prayer this evening?
[11:18] We want to unite our hearts together.
[11:20] How many were blessed by the Cochman
[11:22] family?
[11:23] They need your prayers tonight. Their
[11:26] little sister Caroline's 7-year-old son
[11:30] Samuel is in the hospital with an
[11:31] infection that has paralyzed half of his
[11:34] face. Just praying that the great
[11:36] physician will step in and on their
[11:39] behalf. So, why don't we unite our
[11:40] hearts together
[11:42] for that need? If you have a need upon
[11:45] your heart this evening, we'll pray with
[11:46] you as well. Just make it known by the
[11:48] uplifted hand. Brother Ken, would you
[11:50] come and pray?
[11:52] Let's bow our heads.
[11:56] Our blessed savior Jesus Christ, we give
[12:00] you praise tonight, thanksgiving from
[12:02] our hearts for all things. You have
[12:07] changed us from what we were to what we
[12:10] are.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; We are thankful for all that you've done
[12:13] for us in your redeeming work. You're
[12:15] keeping power. And Lord Jesus, is a
[12:18] scripture that's quoted so often at
[12:19] church gatherings that where two or
[12:21] three are gathered together, there you
[12:23] are in the midst. Lord Jesus, we accept
[12:26] that tonight that you walk with the
[12:28] redeemed. You walk with your children.
[12:31] You embody a people that will stay with
[12:35] your word and your nature lives through
[12:38] them. We believe Lord that we're a part
[12:40] of that great universal body of Jesus
[12:45] Christ and gathered here tonight. So we
[12:48] accept you Lord. We welcome you into our
[12:50] midst. We feel privileged tonight to
[12:53] have the creator of the universe here
[12:56] within us.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; We are thankful to have the great healer
[13:01] of the sick
[13:02] &gt;&gt; and the discouraged and the infirmed to
[13:06] have you with us tonight, embodied in
[13:09] this people. We are thankful, Lord, that
[13:12] your Holy Spirit that come 2,000 years
[13:15] ago is embodying us. And I pray,
[13:18] heavenly father, that as the word is
[13:20] preached tonight from your ministry, we
[13:25] will receive that word. Lord Jesus, give
[13:28] us hungry hearts. Help us to rightly
[13:31] divide the word as we receive it into
[13:33] our hearts. We would not as your
[13:37] children just swallow anything. We've
[13:40] come here tonight to swallow and to feed
[13:43] upon the great body word of Jesus
[13:46] Christ. That's what we're looking to
[13:48] receive. Heavenly Father, we pray that
[13:50] you'll stretch forth your hand and touch
[13:52] this musical family. They have a little
[13:55] one that's infirmed and hurt right now,
[13:58] Lord. And we pray God that you'll touch
[14:01] and heal the child in the name of Jesus
[14:05] Christ. May he be a testimony for you as
[14:09] the child rises up.
[14:12] And Lord Jesus, our families here
[14:14] tonight. We here tonight are represent
[14:17] representatives
[14:19] of a family. Maybe all of our family
[14:22] isn't here tonight, but our hearts reach
[14:24] out to them. And in the name of Jesus
[14:26] Christ, we lay hands upon those that are
[14:30] part of the extended family, both
[14:33] physical and spiritual. Lord Jesus,
[14:36] tonight we want to leave this building
[14:40] closer to you in a greater reality and
[14:43] understanding of your word and
[14:46] appreciation of you. Bless our pastor,
[14:48] brother Bisll. We pray God that you'll
[14:51] guide this assembly through his
[14:53] leadership and the ministry that's here.
[14:56] Continue to feed our souls Lord and make
[14:58] us strong make us strong stalwart
[15:02] Christians to be first of character and
[15:05] of nature of God in our lives. And then
[15:09] after that we can minister, we can sing,
[15:12] we can preach, we can do something after
[15:15] we have lived the life and we have seen
[15:17] you incarnate within us. In the name of
[15:21] the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask your
[15:22] blessing upon the continuation of the
[15:24] service in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you each and everyone as
[15:32] you have your seats this evening. Greet
[15:35] you all once again in the name of the
[15:36] Lord.
[15:39] Do you feel encouraged after the weekend
[15:41] of meetings?
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe your body's a little bit in
[15:45] weary, but certainly encouraged and
[15:46] strengthened on the inner man.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; We can deny our flesh for a few more
[15:50] minutes, another half hour, another 45
[15:53] minutes, maybe endure another hour. The
[15:55] inner man was encouraging the flesh to
[15:58] sit still
[15:59] &gt;&gt; because a lot a lot was said. I trust
[16:02] that you gleaned a lot from the
[16:03] meetings.
[16:05] Did you memorize the three things that
[16:07] were on the little demand here for three
[16:10] days before your eyes? Okay, there will
[16:12] be a test later. So, if you haven't,
[16:15] I'll let you check your notes. Tomorrow,
[16:18] big Thanksgiving US holiday. A great
[16:21] opportunity for believers to get
[16:23] together and give thanksgiving unto the
[16:26] Lord who is we're most thankful for. The
[16:29] Americans have probably forgot the true
[16:32] meaning of thanksgiving, but believers
[16:34] can celebrate it truly. For the
[16:36] forefathers came and and escaped
[16:39] religious
[16:40] persecution.
[16:42] And so we today truly can celebrate
[16:45] Thanksgiving.
[16:46] So we'll do that tomorrow. It's a
[16:48] Thanksgiving potluck. So if you're
[16:50] coming down, make sure that you bring a
[16:52] small dish or a dessert or something.
[16:54] And if you don't know what to bring,
[16:56] call the the office there at the camp
[16:58] and I'm sure they've got a fairly large
[17:01] list of things that uh that are coming
[17:03] down and those that might be needed. So,
[17:05] make sure you touch base with them if
[17:07] you're interested in spending the
[17:09] weekend down or spending the night down
[17:11] there after Turkey. Sometimes you can
[17:13] get a little sleepy. I don't know if
[17:14] anybody's experienced that, but uh
[17:17] there's plenty of cabins that are still
[17:18] available, so you're welcome to uh make
[17:20] a reservation and spend the weekend down
[17:23] there. Sunday morning will be the only
[17:25] service here this weekend. So, we trust
[17:28] that uh you'll come with your lick of
[17:29] fire and your pull of faith and we'll be
[17:31] able to enjoy a great time in the
[17:33] presence of the Lord on Sunday together.
[17:35] Sunday morning service be no evening
[17:37] service. Well, we want to turn right to
[17:40] the word, invite our pastor to come,
[17:43] minister what the Lord has in store for
[17:47] us this evening. We do believe that it's
[17:49] a spiritual food in due season.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; It's exactly what we have need of today.
[17:54] The great heavenly father knows what we
[17:56] need. Why don't we just sing as we unite
[17:59] our hearts together? Only believe, only
[18:01] believe. as we invite Brother Ed to
[18:03] come.
[18:06] Only
[18:08] believe.
[18:13] Only
[18:15] believe.
[18:19] All things are possible.
[18:26] Holy
[18:28] really,
[18:32] only
[18:36] [Music]
[18:45] all things are possible.
[18:53] Believe.
[18:56] Oh Lord,
[19:00] I believe.
[19:03] Yes, Lord,
[19:06] I believe
[19:08] [Music]
[19:09] that all things are possible.
[19:16] Lord God
[19:19] I believe.
[19:22] Lord
[19:24] I
[19:27] [Music]
[19:28] Lord
[19:31] I believe
[19:35] all things are possible.
[19:41] Lord, I
[19:44] believe for Jesus is here. Jesus
[19:50] is here.
[19:53] Yes, Jesus
[19:54] [Music]
[19:56] is here.
[19:59] And all things are possible
[20:05] since Jesus
[20:08] is here.
[20:11] Jesus
[20:12] [Music]
[20:14] is here.
[20:17] Jesus
[20:20] is
[20:23] and all things are possible
[20:29] since Jesus
[20:32] is here.
[20:34] [Music]
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:38] Isn't he wonderful?
[20:41] I just got an email uh within the last
[20:44] hour from from Israel
[20:48] and uh there's a small group that has
[20:52] come to the message over there
[20:55] and uh they're now they're now 10 plus
[20:59] children
[21:00] and they're they're meeting they have
[21:02] two meetings a week in the home and
[21:06] they're even looking to get a place
[21:09] where that will a a a place where
[21:13] believers meet. And I thought this is
[21:16] just so remarkable.
[21:18] So wonderful. They're uh Russian Jews. I
[21:22] mean a Russian people who have moved to
[21:24] Israel. And I think one I understand is
[21:27] a Russian Jew.
[21:30] And uh
[21:32] so they're just, you know,
[21:35] please come over and help us.
[21:38] that kind of a an email, but I guess I
[21:40] email it just about every week. It's
[21:43] it's uh it's wonderful that I want you
[21:48] to feel the connection
[21:51] &gt;&gt; because they're not somebody on another
[21:54] planet someplace. They're just not very
[21:57] many hours from us
[22:00] uh by way of jet travel. and uh and they
[22:04] want to be they want to feel that you're
[22:07] connected.
[22:09] They want you to feel connected with
[22:10] them.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; And the reason I I'm saying that so that
[22:15] you might be able to respond is because
[22:18] they're going to see this service also.
[22:21] And uh and so we want to be able to say,
[22:24] "God bless you."
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Stand firm.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Be a witness for Christ. There's no word
[22:33] like this word.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; And uh it is just so remarkable. The one
[22:38] sister, she's uh praying for her
[22:41] husband, good man, a Christian man, has
[22:45] not embraced fully the message yet at
[22:47] this time. But uh it's in their home
[22:50] where they have the meetings. So I think
[22:52] that's wonderful. I I we're not don't
[22:55] want to say too much, but uh we want to
[22:58] let you know. And also
[23:01] uh brother brother brother brother
[23:02] brother brother brother brother brother
[23:02] brother brother brother brother brother
[23:02] brother brother brother brother brother
[23:02] brother brother brother Ernie forwarded
[23:03] a uh a letter from a pastor Henry Rance
[23:07] in in the Philippines and he wanted uh
[23:11] us to convey thanks to the congregation
[23:15] to the people those that perhaps are
[23:17] streaming that have given and provided
[23:22] uh help for the for the people in the
[23:25] Philippines during the terrible
[23:27] devastation
[23:28] and that they've had and he wanted you
[23:30] to know that they have visited uh the
[23:32] various groups and places and churches
[23:35] and have made distribution as as uh we
[23:38] we were able and other churches were
[23:40] able to provide for them. So they wanted
[23:43] to be sure and give thanks to you. So
[23:45] you we receive that in the name of the
[23:47] Lord as well.
[23:50] Uh we're going to I'm going to ask our
[23:54] brother Victor Vamora if you would come
[23:57] down, brother Victor. And I want to say
[23:59] a few words. Brother Victor is uh
[24:02] leaving in a few days. And
[24:05] um I think about the 28th,
[24:10] excuse me.
[24:12] And he's going uh he's going to Nigeria.
[24:15] only this time he is not going to
[24:18] Nigeria
[24:20] uh for
[24:22] his work his profession he's going he
[24:26] wants to go
[24:28] because of a spiritual purpose
[24:31] brother Victor has a brother in the
[24:33] flesh that's a pastor
[24:36] uh but brother Victor was also
[24:39] uh you could come here brother Victor
[24:42] would be fine brother Victor was also so
[24:45] instrumental in in I would say
[24:48] presenting the message there to his
[24:51] brother and to the people and more or
[24:53] less having uh a a very real part in
[24:59] that work being birthed.
[25:02] His brother has never been ordained to
[25:06] the ministry. So, they're going to be
[25:08] having an ordination min uh ordination
[25:11] service and a pastor from another place
[25:15] is coming and they're going to have a
[25:16] meeting and his brother is going to be
[25:18] ordained.
[25:20] Brother Victor is going for that to be
[25:24] part of that service and part of that
[25:26] ordination.
[25:28] Brother Victor feels a real burden on
[25:30] his heart for the word has for years but
[25:34] has never
[25:35] uh had the say the freedom perhaps
[25:39] because of his employment and so on to
[25:41] to be able to give himself but he has a
[25:44] special burden and a vision for getting
[25:47] the message into the languages of the
[25:49] people.
[25:51] This brother is just and one more
[25:53] brother
[25:54] who became consumed
[25:58] and it just uh it it it connected. I
[26:01] could think it would fit like a glove
[26:04] when he had brother Kim speak to him and
[26:07] he heard about the the hub.
[26:11] Brother, brother Victor then made
[26:13] contact with a a a very well-known and
[26:17] wellestablished
[26:19] uh minister in Nigeria. And
[26:22] incidentally, Nigeria, for those of you
[26:24] that don't know, is the most populated
[26:27] country in Africa with 150 million
[26:31] people.
[26:34] 150 million. That's five times and half
[26:38] the half the size of United States.
[26:41] And this brother,
[26:43] brother Victor, uh, felt that there was
[26:46] three languages that really needed to be
[26:50] translated of the African languages. And
[26:55] this pastor, he said, I have translators
[26:58] for all three of those languages.
[27:01] So part of this journey is to go over
[27:05] and to meet also with him
[27:09] to initiate that part of the program.
[27:12] And you know, it's just mind-boggling to
[27:15] think that as soon as a translation is
[27:18] done in these various languages
[27:21] that have never been perhaps ever done,
[27:23] I don't know, and then they will be made
[27:27] available over that entire vast country
[27:32] immediately ready
[27:34] &gt;&gt; for them to uh little pastors and so on,
[27:38] whatever corner of Nigeria they're in or
[27:40] other countries, they will be able to
[27:43] have access to that. That is astounding.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I I trust that you have
[27:50] the same, you know, the same burden and
[27:52] same vision. And so they're been very
[27:55] very excited about that. And then
[27:57] brother Victor will continue on from
[28:00] there down to Ghana. And is there a
[28:03] convention in in Ghana? Uh conventions,
[28:06] a special meeting in Ghana. And uh so
[28:10] he's very very burdened that God will
[28:13] also not only direct and I've called him
[28:16] forward because we're going to have
[28:17] prayer here. I'm I'm going to ask you to
[28:20] stand. I'm going to ask brother Ken
[28:23] Andes if you come. Brother Kim I would
[28:25] like you to come as well because you
[28:27] have such a part in directing what is
[28:30] taking place. And perhaps I don't even I
[28:34] trust I've said everything
[28:36] right. It's pretty close. It's accurate
[28:39] enough. All right. And we want to just
[28:43] have prayer with our brother Victor. And
[28:46] this was what he desired that God will
[28:49] give him spiritual direction
[28:53] because he wants to give his life as
[28:56] much as is possible
[28:58] to the work of the Lord. and uh
[29:01] representing
[29:03] what uh brother Kim and Bible believers
[29:06] is seeking to do. And isn't it, say
[29:09] friends, to me it's just absolutely
[29:11] marvelous.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody just steps out of, you know, uh
[29:16] I thought he was going back to
[29:20] do some more work, employment with Shell
[29:22] Oil. And so he tells me the other day,
[29:25] "No, I've retired.
[29:27] I I I just I want to do something for
[29:30] God."
[29:31] &gt;&gt; I say, "God bless you, Brother Victor."
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand, shall we?
[29:38] And I wonder brother Kim and brother Ken
[29:40] if you would come. Brother Tom, we're
[29:42] going to have prayer together. Yeah.
[29:44] We'll just have you here.
[29:51] Wonderful Jesus.
[29:55] Wonderful Jesus. Wonderful Jesus.
[30:01] Heavenly Father,
[30:06] we join hearttoheart,
[30:08] attribute to attribute.
[30:12] Sons and daughters of God that are
[30:14] standing together.
[30:16] We have one ambition that your will
[30:19] shall be done.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; In this vessel,
[30:23] our precious brother Victor Adam, you
[30:26] have dealt with him for years. He has
[30:29] been burdened for years. He has done
[30:31] everything that his hand was able to do.
[30:34] He has spoken. He has been a witness. He
[30:38] has caused others to come to the
[30:40] message. He's caused ministers to be
[30:42] stirred, Lord. And now I pray, Father,
[30:46] that there will be a fresh and new
[30:49] endowment of the Holy Spirit upon him. I
[30:53] pray that he will be empowered. I ask
[30:56] that you'll give him words and you'll
[30:58] give him wisdom. Lord, I pray, Father,
[31:01] as he had desires to set himself aside
[31:04] for the ministry and for what your will
[31:06] is in his life to minister and bring the
[31:10] word to the people, Lord, to bring this
[31:13] glorious gospel
[31:15] &gt;&gt; and to work, Lord Jesus. I pray that the
[31:19] vision, Father, that has been so
[31:22] fruitful throughout the world, oh God,
[31:25] he desires to work with the the people
[31:28] here and our brother Kim and the Bible
[31:30] believers and Lord, wherever they are in
[31:32] the world, but especially in Africa,
[31:34] Lord, and the let him find those needy
[31:37] places, Lord. Let him find those hungry
[31:40] ones, oh God. And I pray that you'll
[31:44] prosper his way, Lord. you'll prosper
[31:47] the work and the translators, I pray, oh
[31:50] God, you'll find the right ones and they
[31:53] will be gripped by the need and they
[31:55] will give themselves. Oh Lord, I ask in
[31:58] the name of Jesus Christ with this group
[32:01] of people tonight, this congregation.
[32:04] You will send him with the blessings of
[32:07] almighty God upon him. Lord,
[32:10] &gt;&gt; I pray that his labors will be fruitful
[32:13] &gt;&gt; and that he'll have a sweet a sweet
[32:17] fulfillment, Lord,
[32:19] &gt;&gt; that he is walking in your perfect will.
[32:21] Protect him on the way
[32:23] &gt;&gt; and bless his family that is here, Lord.
[32:26] Oh God, I pray you'll bless the Adam
[32:29] family, Father, in the name of Jesus
[32:32] Christ.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Hallelujah.
[32:39] Praise God.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Victor. Amen.
[32:48] And greet the people wherever you go for
[32:50] us.
[32:53] Hallelujah.
[32:56] That's wonderful.
[32:58] While you're standing, we'll uh I'll uh
[33:02] have you join with me in reading some
[33:04] scripture.
[33:08] Thank you all for coming on this not so
[33:11] nice
[33:13] I won't say a day it's just another one
[33:16] just another day. God bless you for
[33:18] coming and uh I hope you're able to make
[33:22] it out to the camp and bring something
[33:23] with you as our brother
[33:27] Derek was saying. you know, because I
[33:30] got a little afraid after I announced
[33:31] because I got thinking maybe everybody's
[33:33] going to come down and and we have we
[33:36] we'll all be expecting cuz brother Derek
[33:39] said he said something about five
[33:40] turkeys. Well, I don't know. But I've
[33:43] never seen a believer short on food. But
[33:46] but anyway, I hope you're able to come
[33:48] down. We'll have a wonderful time of
[33:50] fellowship. I want to read out of he out
[33:53] of Hebrews the 11th chapter.
[33:58] And we'll start at the 32nd verse.
[34:10] I'm just expecting a nice relaxed time
[34:12] with you tonight.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; I hope you are.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; And we're just going to dig into some
[34:18] scriptures here and perhaps be able to
[34:21] come to this subject in a fuller way in
[34:24] another time. Verse
[34:27] 32.
[34:29] And what shall I more say? For the time
[34:32] would fail me to tell of Gideon and of
[34:35] Barack and of Samson and of Jeffy, of
[34:38] David also and Samuel and of the
[34:40] prophets, who through faith subdued
[34:43] kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
[34:45] obtained promises, stopped the mouths of
[34:47] lions, quenched the violence of fire,
[34:50] escaped the edge of the sword. out of
[34:53] weakness were made strong, waxed valiant
[34:56] in fight, turned to uh flight the armies
[35:00] of the aliens.
[35:02] Women received their dead, raised to
[35:04] life again, and others were tortured,
[35:07] not accepting deliverance, that they
[35:09] might obtain a better resurrection. And
[35:11] others had trial of cruel mockings and
[35:14] scourgings, yay, moreover, of bonds and
[35:17] imprisonment.
[35:19] They were stoned. They were saw a
[35:21] sunder. Were tempted. Were slain with a
[35:24] sword. They wandered about in sheep
[35:26] skins and goat skins being destitute,
[35:29] afflicted, tormented,
[35:31] of whom the world is not worthy.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; They wandered in deserts and mountains
[35:37] and in dens and caves of the earth. And
[35:41] these all, having obtained a good report
[35:43] through faith, received not the promise.
[35:47] God having provided some better thing
[35:50] for us that they without us should not
[35:53] be made perfect. Amen. God bless his
[35:56] word to us. Together as you have your
[36:00] seats.
[36:03] I I I want to
[36:06] uh speak to you on a good report.
[36:12] And uh it says these all
[36:16] having obtained a good report.
[36:20] The people that are listed here and not
[36:23] only here but throughout the whole
[36:25] chapter, the 11th chapter, which is
[36:27] called the
[36:29] uh
[36:30] heroes of faith.
[36:34] So, I'm just going to go slowly. I want
[36:36] you to absorb. I want you to absorb
[36:39] because we want to bring it right to
[36:41] this time and to our lives and to our
[36:46] individual walk.
[36:50] These people,
[36:52] they lived over an a very long period of
[36:55] time, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[36:58] of years apart. They lived in different
[37:02] uh geographical locations. They lived
[37:05] under very different conditions.
[37:08] They went all the way from being
[37:11] uh royalty.
[37:14] Some of these that are spoken of, they
[37:17] were
[37:19] almost like gods to the people.
[37:24] Uh Moses on his way to be a pharaoh.
[37:27] So they knew what it was to be at the
[37:30] epitome, the apex of of wealth,
[37:36] fame,
[37:38] royalty,
[37:39] almost worship by the people. And that
[37:42] was that was a above and beyond success.
[37:48] And God allowed that God allowed them to
[37:51] have that kind of a life. And at the
[37:55] same time then there were these others
[37:57] which we've read about destitute
[38:00] wandered about caves and lived in caves
[38:03] and dens of the earth and scourgings and
[38:06] bonds and imprisonments
[38:08] and
[38:10] we're we're somewhere in between.
[38:14] None of us are are are in royalty. None
[38:17] of us are having that measure of what
[38:20] the world might call success. Uh we're
[38:24] not in bonds. We're not imprisonments.
[38:27] Uh we're we're not experiencing
[38:29] scourgings. We're not spat upon. We're
[38:33] we don't have that. But we are
[38:35] believers.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; We are believers.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And we're somewhere in between
[38:43] uh these two extremities.
[38:47] But the Bible says, "And these all
[38:49] obtained
[38:50] a good report."
[38:52] Now, I want to introduce to you right
[38:54] away a thought that I've been pondering
[38:56] for uh quite a long time.
[38:59] And that that's why I was determined to
[39:01] speak tonight regardless of my voice or
[39:03] anything else. I wanted to introduce I
[39:06] want you to ponder it in the coming
[39:09] days, weeks, months, whatever.
[39:12] And that is that
[39:15] regardless of who we are
[39:18] and what our station in life is, we're
[39:21] all quite different here tonight. We've
[39:23] come from different backgrounds. We have
[39:26] different educational levels. We have
[39:28] different levels of skill and and and uh
[39:33] uh we're we're made up different. We
[39:35] have different characteristics and uh
[39:38] different natures and all of these
[39:41] things are very very different. And yet
[39:43] we have one thing in common that these
[39:45] had all in common that is they had a
[39:47] faith in God the true living God. They
[39:52] could not be moved but what he was their
[39:56] God and they were going to serve him.
[40:00] Live, die, be successful, be a failure.
[40:04] they were going to serve him. They had
[40:06] that one thing in common.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; We have something in common here
[40:10] tonight. We have something in common
[40:13] because you wouldn't even be here at
[40:15] service if you didn't have that in
[40:17] common. That you have a unqualified
[40:21] commitment to the God that called you,
[40:24] to the God that spoke to you, to the God
[40:27] that has provided salvation for you. And
[40:29] we have that in common. And that's
[40:32] wonderful.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely wonderful.
[40:37] But God allows things and he has he
[40:40] allowed these people and he allows these
[40:44] people he allows us to be confronted
[40:49] uh with things. He allows things
[40:52] circumstances conditions
[40:55] uh of this time. Brother Brandham talks
[40:57] about the pressures of the age of the
[41:01] the different ages that the people lived
[41:03] in. So there was the dark ages and they
[41:06] had their pressures. There was there was
[41:08] the age of perhaps the renaissance and
[41:11] all of and there's been the great times
[41:14] and the good times and the poor times
[41:17] and all kinds of things that perhaps we
[41:20] are even blindsided. We're not expecting
[41:24] uh you know something to take place.
[41:27] We're not expecting that that would
[41:29] happen in our lives. We're not expecting
[41:31] that we'd be called on to do or to uh
[41:37] that we wouldn't be called on by God to
[41:39] answer to some situation that whether it
[41:43] be in our life or in our home or in our
[41:45] family or in our church or or in the
[41:48] nation or in the country.
[41:51] And yet we are called on.
[41:55] So there there's another aspect that I
[41:59] that needs to merge with this thought as
[42:02] we move through and that is that
[42:08] and I can't answer the question exactly
[42:11] but I have asked myself over and over
[42:15] why is it that when
[42:19] uh the good times or we can say the
[42:23] fullness of life and things are just
[42:27] going just uh unre with unrestrained
[42:32] success and just a wonderful. We have
[42:36] good health and we have good friends and
[42:39] we've got uh good this and good that and
[42:42] we don't have any need and we just come
[42:45] oh it's just a blessing of God and it
[42:48] is. There's no question about it. But
[42:50] it's amazing how
[42:54] in the fullness and I'm going to give
[42:56] you several examples. When the fullness
[42:58] comes, people there's like a
[43:03] a debilitating,
[43:05] if that's the right word. It's like a
[43:08] deterioration
[43:09] of spiritual
[43:12] strength and the ruggedness and and and
[43:16] you know that rugged faith that rugged
[43:20] Christian
[43:22] you know if when we get kind of spoiled
[43:26] &gt;&gt; and you know uh things that didn't
[43:28] bother start to irritate us and you know
[43:31] it's cold in the church or infatismal
[43:35] things or it's too hot or the preacher's
[43:38] too loud or he's too quiet or he's too
[43:41] short or he's too long or or we you know
[43:45] and and these things start to uh affect
[43:49] us and afflict us and then and then
[43:52] there are other things that maybe even
[43:54] amongst uh not always young people but
[43:58] and I I'm I'm you are here tonight will
[44:01] benefit if I if I'm able to approach
[44:04] this again and I want to carry it quite
[44:06] quite a bit further.
[44:08] But in the fullness, we'll find and and
[44:11] as I move forward now, you'll you'll see
[44:14] it in the scripture.
[44:16] What could be more complete and full
[44:19] than the perfection of Eden?
[44:25] Harmony with God that we know nothing
[44:27] about.
[44:31] a perfection that we've never seen and
[44:33] won't see until we come into another
[44:36] Eden.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing wanting, nothing lacking for
[44:42] body, spirit or soul. Nothing. You talk
[44:47] about a fullness, they had the fullness.
[44:52] They had the absolute perfection,
[44:55] the perfection of everything. And yet
[44:59] you'd wonder how in that fullness could
[45:02] anyone even hanker or how could Satan be
[45:07] successful at even uh uh uh causing Eve
[45:11] to desire something more than they had.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; That's unthinkable.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; But yet in the midst of that perfection,
[45:22] there was a a a deterioration of some
[45:25] sort. And we can call it a deception. We
[45:28] can call it whatever we want. But and
[45:30] I'm not trying to define it too clearly
[45:33] tonight, but the amazing thing is that
[45:35] it could even happen in that
[45:37] environment.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; And so the downfall came
[45:44] in the state of fullness.
[45:47] And so it's it's it's it's uh it's also
[45:51] amazing to me that
[45:53] in this chapter 11 of Hebrews, Adam and
[45:57] Eve are not mentioned.
[46:00] Of the heroes of faith, they're not
[46:02] mentioned. Their son Abel, who the
[46:05] prophet continually declared, "By
[46:08] revelation, he took a lamb. By
[46:11] revelation, he shed blood. By
[46:13] revelation, he built the altar. Cain
[46:15] built an altar, too, but not by
[46:16] revelation, just by religion. So, we
[46:19] don't know. But here's one that had
[46:20] revelation. And so, now, Apostle Paul
[46:23] picks it up and says, "By faith, Abel
[46:26] &gt;&gt; offered a more excellent sacrifice."
[46:29] &gt;&gt; And so, Adam is not mentioned and Eve is
[46:32] not mentioned. A Abel is the one that is
[46:35] mentioned and they're not included. The
[46:37] scripture says, "By faith, Abel offered
[46:39] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[46:42] Cain.
[46:46] So in this place of perfection and
[46:48] plenty, in this place of abundance,
[46:51] in this place of fellowship and harmony
[46:55] and nothing lacking,
[46:58] we find
[47:00] this
[47:03] something taking place.
[47:09] I want to refer you to the fullness of
[47:11] Israel.
[47:13] And this wasn't spoken just once. Now
[47:16] God said it several times.
[47:20] And there's
[47:23] he spoken uh I'm going to just read for
[47:25] you. You can just listen.
[47:28] Now these are the commandments and
[47:30] statutes and the judgments which the
[47:32] Lord your God commanded to teach you
[47:35] that you might do them in the land
[47:37] whether you go to possess it. Now, this
[47:40] was the word of God coming to them. They
[47:43] didn't have any script. They didn't have
[47:45] any books about it, but they had a
[47:48] prophet that was speaking it. Our
[47:50] conditions today are entirely different.
[47:53] All of the temptations and all of the
[47:55] evil and all of the and not only evil,
[47:58] all of the success,
[48:01] all of the good and all of the bad. Uh
[48:04] we're living under a completely
[48:06] different scenario, but it's the same
[48:08] devil
[48:10] &gt;&gt; that was in Eden. The exactly the same
[48:13] devil. Nothing's changed. He works the
[48:16] same kind of devices, the same kind of
[48:18] suggestions. He's got the same
[48:21] enticements, the same kind of the the
[48:23] the conditions have changed. The
[48:25] environment has changed, circumstances
[48:27] have changed, but the same devil trying
[48:30] to achieve the same thing. Right.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; And so they had a fullness. Adam and Eve
[48:36] had their fullness. But now we have
[48:38] another fullness. And here we are. And I
[48:41] I don't want to get ahead of myself, but
[48:42] here we are now having a prophet. And
[48:46] just perhaps I can give you this uh
[48:49] little bit of lead in in the thought.
[48:53] Brother Bram says, "Since the seals have
[48:55] been opened,
[48:58] since the fullness of the word has come,
[49:02] &gt;&gt; it's wonderful,
[49:03] &gt;&gt; but it's very dangerous."
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's true.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; It's true. And I'm speaking from the
[49:11] perception
[49:13] which is astounding to me,
[49:16] absolutely leaves me speechless
[49:19] sometimes where people that have
[49:22] proclaimed to be believers and are
[49:26] walking in the uh as professing
[49:30] believers. But then when we come to what
[49:32] this prophet has said, they find that in
[49:36] this and and find it everywhere. The
[49:39] same devil, he is trying to entice
[49:42] people and and is successful enticing
[49:45] people to not take the word of God very
[49:49] seriously.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And it's so innocent. And that's where
[49:54] the problem starts. That's right.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Don't take the word that God has sent
[50:00] very seriously. Yeah. Well, you know, he
[50:03] said it, but then there's there's this
[50:05] and you know, and then uh the conditions
[50:07] and the circumstances that I live under
[50:10] and different things that are happening
[50:12] in my life or in my home or in my and so
[50:16] somehow the the surroundings seem to
[50:21] cause people to put less importance upon
[50:25] the word and the circumstances and
[50:28] conditions that we're living in begin to
[50:31] take precedence. idence
[50:33] &gt;&gt; over it.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Anything that
[50:39] comes ahead of God
[50:42] &gt;&gt; is what?"
[50:43] &gt;&gt; As an idol,
[50:45] &gt;&gt; it's idolatry.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; And he said, "You can make anything an
[50:49] idol." He said, "You can make the piano
[50:51] an idol.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; You can make your car an idol. You can
[50:54] make your family an idol. Anything that
[50:56] comes between us and God is an idol."
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I thought I would just throw
[51:02] that in.
[51:04] And so, now God is speaking through
[51:06] Moses and he says, now he refers
[51:09] immediately to the commandments that
[51:12] thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to
[51:15] keep all his statutes and his
[51:17] commandments which I command with thee,
[51:20] thou and thy son, and thy son's son, all
[51:24] the days of thy life, and that thy days
[51:27] may be prolonged. That's quite
[51:29] comprehensive.
[51:31] Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to
[51:34] do it, that it may be well with thee,
[51:37] and that you may increase mightily, as
[51:41] the Lord thy God of thy fathers hath
[51:43] promised thee, in the land that flowth
[51:46] with milk and honey. This isn't a this
[51:50] isn't a a a destitute desert desert
[51:53] place. Here's a land that flows with
[51:56] milk and honey. And I want you to
[51:58] increase mightily here. O Israel, the
[52:01] Lord our God is one Lord. And thou shalt
[52:04] love the Lord thy God with all thine
[52:06] heart, with all thy soul, and with all
[52:09] thy might. And these words which I
[52:11] command thee this day shall be in thine
[52:14] heart. Thou shalt teach them uh
[52:18] diligently unto your children, and you
[52:21] shall talk of them, when you sit uh in
[52:24] in thine house, and when thou walst by
[52:27] the way, and when thou liest down, and
[52:31] when thou riseest up. This word shall
[52:34] have precedence.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; They have to establish that first. This
[52:38] word must be have precedence over
[52:40] everything else. This is what you shall
[52:42] do. And you young people here and you
[52:45] parents that are here and all of us
[52:47] grandparents or whatever more. This is
[52:49] the thing that God is saying through
[52:51] Moses and he's never going to change his
[52:53] nature his his mind on this. And thou
[52:57] shalt bind them for a sign upon thy
[52:59] hand. That's why the Jewish people have
[53:01] the straps over their hands like that.
[53:04] And and they shall be frontlets between
[53:06] thine eyes. And if you've seen these
[53:08] Orthodox Jewish people, they have that
[53:10] little box right here, right as a front
[53:12] lit for their eyes. This is this is
[53:14] where they're getting it from. And thou
[53:17] shalt write them upon the post of thy
[53:19] house and on and on thy gates. And it
[53:23] shall be when the Lord thy God shall
[53:26] have brought thee into the land which he
[53:29] swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to
[53:32] Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great
[53:35] and goodly cities, which thou buildest
[53:38] not, and houses full of good things,
[53:42] which thou filest not, and wells digged,
[53:46] which thou digest not, and vineyards,
[53:48] and olive trees which thou plantest not.
[53:52] When thou shalt have eaten and be full,
[53:55] then beware, lest lest thou forget the
[53:59] Lord which brought thee forth out of the
[54:02] land of Egypt from the house of bondage.
[54:05] And I can say when you come into the
[54:07] land when God has called you and brought
[54:09] you in and things that you couldn't see,
[54:11] things that were so complicated and
[54:14] mysterious and you were so steeped in
[54:17] religion, you were so steeped in
[54:19] whatever you were in and and suddenly
[54:21] you became set free
[54:25] &gt;&gt; and sight that you didn't purchase,
[54:28] &gt;&gt; vision that you didn't have, an
[54:30] understanding that was completely beyond
[54:32] your ability. and I give you lands and I
[54:35] give you fellowship and I give you
[54:37] brothers and I give you sisters. I give
[54:39] you family. I give you all of these
[54:42] things.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; In that fullness,
[54:47] he said, "Beware
[54:49] lest you forget the Lord
[54:52] &gt;&gt; which brought thee out of the land of
[54:54] Egypt from the house of bondage. Thou
[54:57] shalt fear the Lord thy God and serve
[54:59] him. And thou shalt swear and shalt
[55:01] swear by his name. H ye shall not go
[55:05] after other gods of the gods of the
[55:08] people which are around about you. These
[55:11] people going to be all around about. And
[55:14] so it was the people all around about
[55:16] which were having some kind of an
[55:18] effect. And I'm not just speaking here
[55:21] to the congregation that is here
[55:23] tonight, but I I I'm I'm speaking this
[55:26] to you that you can perhaps
[55:30] have a better grasp. Uh, and I guess I'm
[55:33] speaking from the perspective of one
[55:36] that, you know, I' I've traveled a a
[55:38] good deal and I've been to a lot of
[55:41] churches and a lot of places and a lot
[55:43] of people and hear about the kind of
[55:45] meetings that people are having. And
[55:47] then I find that there gets to be a
[55:52] maybe a longing within my own soul and
[55:55] spirit. And uh you you think of the
[55:59] simplicity.
[56:01] Uh you think of the rugged faith of
[56:04] people. You think of what people went
[56:07] through and even what they're enduring
[56:09] today in different places. And I'm sure
[56:12] as our brother uh Victor Adamora goes uh
[56:16] to Nigeria, he will find himself in in a
[56:19] very few days, he'll find himself in
[56:22] conditions which are extremely different
[56:24] from this
[56:27] &gt;&gt; and people don't have the same access.
[56:30] uh they maybe don't have the same
[56:32] ministry certainly don't have the same
[56:34] comfort and don't have and so we have
[56:38] you know here in uh America the western
[56:40] world uh we're we're rather consumed
[56:43] with a good life
[56:45] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham talks about which I
[56:47] don't want to get into just now and I
[56:49] don't want you to feel any sense of
[56:50] condemnation this is this is to help you
[56:53] and to and to help you to help others as
[56:56] well but brother Brandham talks about
[56:58] the pressure of soft living.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Now, you and I didn't develop the soft
[57:04] living. This whole thing is part of
[57:07] Satan's Eden.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; It's all part of his program. And and
[57:11] soft living certainly isn't what they
[57:13] had in ancient times. And these are
[57:16] wandered around in deserts and caves of
[57:18] the earth, etc., etc. They they they
[57:21] certainly didn't have anything to they
[57:23] didn't have the pressure of self-living.
[57:26] They had a a different kind of a
[57:27] pressure. But the God that kept them is
[57:31] the same God that sees us through in
[57:33] this day.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 8, the 8th chapter. I won't
[57:44] take time to read it, but it goes it
[57:48] says very much the same that God's going
[57:50] to bring you into a good land, a land of
[57:53] brooks. He describes it differently. A
[57:55] land of brooks and fountains and depths
[57:58] and spring that spring out of the
[58:01] valleys and hills of wheat and barley
[58:04] and vines and fig trees and
[58:06] pomegranates, a land of uh oil, olive
[58:09] and honey, a land wherein thou shalt eat
[58:12] bread without scarceness. Thou shalt not
[58:15] lack anything. Say, you'll have
[58:18] revelation upon revelation. You move
[58:21] from glory to glory. You will have one
[58:24] experience after another. Or you might
[58:26] have a complete dry spell. You might
[58:29] hear God speak. You might you might be
[58:32] with someone, they have spectacular
[58:34] experiences. You sit right beside them.
[58:37] You don't have any. It's the same God
[58:40] will take you through whichever
[58:43] situation you are in. Whichever one,
[58:46] whichever category. I can't describe
[58:48] everybody's category, but God will bring
[58:50] you through.
[58:52] I've experienced enough even amongst the
[58:55] assembly and amongst the believers in
[58:57] this area and those that are not with us
[58:59] tonight. I've experienced with them
[59:01] where God allowed things to shake them
[59:05] to their very foundation until it looked
[59:07] like they wouldn't survive. But they
[59:10] they didn't only pull through, they came
[59:12] through stronger.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And you have to believe that
[59:17] &gt;&gt; because whether you feel it or not, it
[59:19] has nothing to do with how you feel. You
[59:21] wouldn't go to one of those that were
[59:23] huddled down in a cave and say, "How you
[59:25] feeling, brother?"
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm I'm baking in this in
[59:29] incredible heat. I' I've I've been
[59:32] breathing dust till I can hardly hardly
[59:35] breathe anymore. My lungs are so full of
[59:37] it. Uh my eyes are burning. Uh I haven't
[59:41] had water to even bathe and to be clean.
[59:45] These conditions are unbelievable. Does
[59:48] God see me? Yes, he was.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; They knew God saw them
[59:54] &gt;&gt; and they were even driven out into these
[59:56] places. They said they didn't care what
[59:59] happened. We're going to saw you
[1:00:00] aunderder. Go ahead and do it. And I can
[1:00:03] tell you if you were in that condition,
[1:00:06] if you were there, you would say the
[1:00:08] same thing because that God, that spirit
[1:00:12] that dwells in you, we we you might
[1:00:15] think, well, I break. No. The spirit
[1:00:17] that's in you that's gripped you, the
[1:00:19] spirit that even brought you to church
[1:00:21] tonight, you may you don't know how
[1:00:23] strong that is until you'd be faced with
[1:00:26] it. You have no idea. And it regardless
[1:00:30] of how dark
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; this age gets, regardless of how
[1:00:34] deceptive this age becomes, regardless
[1:00:37] of whether hell rises as it has to the
[1:00:40] streets of our cities and our towns and
[1:00:43] our communities, regardless of uh demons
[1:00:46] walking in flesh, regardless of that, I
[1:00:49] want to announce to the congregation
[1:00:50] tonight, those that are streaming,
[1:00:52] whoever hears this service, the bride of
[1:00:54] Jesus Christ will overcome in every
[1:00:57] case.
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:01:01] She will not surrender because she
[1:01:03] cannot surrender.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Are they moved? Do they get discouraged?
[1:01:08] Of course.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; But God allows it.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; In fact is God allows it for a purpose
[1:01:17] of bringing forth something in you
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; that he couldn't do any other way. Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; And that's really the hub of my message
[1:01:26] that Lord willing if I come to it. God
[1:01:28] allowed these things. God allowed down
[1:01:31] through the ages different things to
[1:01:33] happen, different uh circumstances. And
[1:01:37] brother Brandon says in each age they
[1:01:39] had to pressure and God counseledled
[1:01:41] them. You read the church ages. If you
[1:01:44] go home in chapter 2 and chapter 3, God
[1:01:47] knew there was going to be different
[1:01:50] under Luther, under Wesley, under
[1:01:52] Columbus, under all of these, under St.
[1:01:55] Martin. God knew exactly. They were
[1:01:57] completely different.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; But the people were victorious in every
[1:02:02] age.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; They had to be because they couldn't do
[1:02:10] anything else. Right.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; But God speaks here when he gives all of
[1:02:17] these. And when you are eaten, when you
[1:02:20] have eaten and you're full,
[1:02:22] he says, "Then thou shalt bless the Lord
[1:02:24] thy God for the good land which he hath
[1:02:27] given thee. And beware that thou forget
[1:02:30] not the Lord thy God." Don't forget him.
[1:02:33] Don't sideline him. Don't make him just
[1:02:36] a sideline issue. He has to be the focal
[1:02:39] point. And don't forget to keep his
[1:02:42] commandments and his judgments and his
[1:02:44] statutes. I say don't forget to keep the
[1:02:46] message first place
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; in your life. You say what is the
[1:02:51] message? Don't confuse the message with
[1:02:52] the word of God. The message is God's
[1:02:55] voice which he sent which we have in
[1:02:58] different forms that that speaks to us
[1:03:01] and unfolds and points us to those
[1:03:04] scriptures in this word of God that are
[1:03:07] applicable to our time.
[1:03:12] And you read that word and then you say,
[1:03:14] "Oh, I know the messenger spoke of
[1:03:18] that." And there it is. And you find
[1:03:20] strength pouring into your system.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] the blessings
[1:03:31] of the fullness.
[1:03:34] It's hard for me to say, but the
[1:03:37] blessings of the fullness actually
[1:03:38] turned them to other gods
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; because of this.
[1:03:44] I even asked my wife, I said, "What is
[1:03:47] the word almost like a debilitating?
[1:03:51] It's like a a a weakness comes in and
[1:03:55] and a frailty and and that rugged
[1:04:00] they've not been exercised in their
[1:04:02] faith. We don't want to, you know, just
[1:04:06] find ourselves in a social environment.
[1:04:10] Now, fellowship, I like we're going to
[1:04:12] have tomorrow. I believe in that and
[1:04:15] we've been invited to different places
[1:04:18] and and I believe there's such strength
[1:04:20] in fellowship and I believe that you
[1:04:22] people ought to fellowship with one
[1:04:24] another but that's not the main uh
[1:04:27] that's not our main course. Uh our main
[1:04:30] course is the word of God and when we
[1:04:32] get together then we fellowship about
[1:04:34] the word and around the word and what
[1:04:36] God is doing. Amen. I'm excited about
[1:04:39] it. Amen.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; So after receiving the fullness, now
[1:04:45] listen to what brother Brandham said
[1:04:46] about Jesus
[1:04:50] and this is in the message and thy seed
[1:04:52] shall possess the gate of his enemy.
[1:04:57] He said Jesus as soon as he received the
[1:05:00] fullness of the spirit on the river when
[1:05:04] John baptized him, immediately the devil
[1:05:08] took him into the wilderness to go
[1:05:11] through a time of temptation.
[1:05:15] As soon as he had received the fullness,
[1:05:18] then he's led into the wilderness. But
[1:05:22] when he took the word of God and
[1:05:24] overcame the devil, it is written, it is
[1:05:28] written, he said he came back out then
[1:05:33] ready for his ministry.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; It didn't it didn't take away from it.
[1:05:39] Didn't he didn't become weakened.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; But when the when the fullness came
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; then
[1:05:51] He was uh tempted.
[1:05:54] The Bible says he was tempted in all
[1:05:57] points
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; as we are.
[1:06:01] I want you to see tempting temptation
[1:06:05] the way the Bible says of of Abraham and
[1:06:10] God did tempt Abraham.
[1:06:12] And the temptation is the best
[1:06:15] explanation for it is the word to assay
[1:06:18] like a miner. like a minor that is that
[1:06:22] is uh uh drilling a core sample and they
[1:06:25] bring core samples uh round core samples
[1:06:29] out of the earth long core samples and
[1:06:33] then they grind that down and they maybe
[1:06:36] use chemicals. They put it through a
[1:06:38] testing all kinds of of uh all kinds of
[1:06:42] testing till it's just ground to nothing
[1:06:45] and they find out what kind of chemicals
[1:06:47] or I mean what kind of minerals and what
[1:06:50] kind of uh riches are in it and they can
[1:06:52] only do that by an assay or attempting a
[1:06:56] a test of the a test of the material
[1:07:00] and and that's what the Bible says. But
[1:07:04] now now I want to just come to Paul's
[1:07:06] time just quickly. I'm moving very
[1:07:08] quickly.
[1:07:10] Paul says this now the Apostle Paul. So
[1:07:13] we had the fullness of Eden,
[1:07:16] all the fullness that God gave his
[1:07:18] children that he loved so dearly, the
[1:07:20] children of Israel. And now we have the
[1:07:23] fullness of Jesus and now the fullness
[1:07:26] of the early church. Just quickly and
[1:07:28] briefly for apostle Paul says for I have
[1:07:32] not shunned to declare unto you all the
[1:07:37] counsel of God. The people might have
[1:07:41] uh they might not if you sat and spoke
[1:07:44] if you were sitting listening to Apostle
[1:07:47] Paul and said do you know that you've
[1:07:49] just heard all the counsel of God?
[1:07:53] Do you know that you've just heard the
[1:07:55] first church age messenger? They didn't
[1:07:57] know that. But God was giving them what
[1:08:00] they needed. It wasn't what Moses gave
[1:08:02] them. It was completely different. But
[1:08:05] it was the same God.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; And they knew that the same devil that
[1:08:10] fought those people back there in Moses
[1:08:13] time is the same one that's going to
[1:08:14] fight the early church. And the same one
[1:08:17] that fought the early church is going to
[1:08:18] fight in the last age. And our
[1:08:20] conditions are completely different.
[1:08:22] They had no idea of stepping into a car
[1:08:24] and turning the key on and having a
[1:08:26] motor fire up and drive away and all the
[1:08:29] comfort and, you know, turn the heat up,
[1:08:31] turn it down, turn the fan up, turn it
[1:08:33] down. Hey, you know, I mean, this is all
[1:08:36] they saw was chariots jostling in the
[1:08:39] straits,
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; And here we are. We don't think anything
[1:08:43] of it
[1:08:45] but it is a soft
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; and with the softness is pressure
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham says also in the
[1:08:56] tension
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; tension nervous tension of this age
[1:09:02] we'll come to it a little later on so
[1:09:04] now he says the fullness I've not I've
[1:09:07] not shun to declare unto you all the
[1:09:11] counsel of God. And then he says to the
[1:09:14] Galatians, "I marvel that you are so
[1:09:17] soon removed from him that called you
[1:09:20] into the grace of Christ unto another
[1:09:22] gospel." Here's this mighty apostle,
[1:09:25] first church age messenger, this this uh
[1:09:28] uh intellectual he was, and yet he
[1:09:30] counted everything as lost that he might
[1:09:32] win Christ. been such an articulate man
[1:09:35] who was such a command of the Old
[1:09:37] Testament and he could turn the law to
[1:09:40] grace and what what an incredible man.
[1:09:43] Wouldn't you like to have lived and sat
[1:09:45] and listen to the Apostle Paul? Brother
[1:09:47] Bren says that little bald uh with a rim
[1:09:51] of of of gray hair, white hair around
[1:09:53] there and a little sharp eyes, glinting
[1:09:56] eyes and a mouth with such words and and
[1:09:59] such a command of the language. What
[1:10:02] what a tower of of a person he was. What
[1:10:05] a tower of character. And then he tells
[1:10:07] the people, I've I declared the whole
[1:10:09] gospel to you. I've revealed the whole
[1:10:11] plan of God through Jesus Christ. Have
[1:10:14] declared the resurrection of Jesus
[1:10:16] Christ. And he has to say to the
[1:10:18] Galatians, I I I I marvel how so soon
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; you've been moved from the gospel and
[1:10:24] yet and to another gospel. And there
[1:10:26] isn't another gospel. Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm not just speaking here
[1:10:33] about this church. I'm speaking what's
[1:10:35] happening in the message.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; So when you look here or you hit there
[1:10:39] or you travel over there, don't be moved
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; by anything.
[1:10:46] you remain steadfast
[1:10:48] and just say like one man and it's in
[1:10:51] the message
[1:10:55] Christian businessmen and they were
[1:10:57] saying something well this way that way
[1:11:00] and so forth and brother Carl Williams I
[1:11:03] believe it was he stood up and said
[1:11:05] that's not the way brother Brandham says
[1:11:06] it
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; right that's right
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; God bless him for that
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; God bless him for that
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; and then He says, and through Peter, the
[1:11:17] Apostle Peter says, "Seeing you have
[1:11:19] purified your souls in obeying the truth
[1:11:23] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[1:11:26] of the brethren. See that you love one
[1:11:28] another with a pure heart fervently." So
[1:11:31] here we are. This is a perhaps another
[1:11:33] aspect of it. Seeing you have purified
[1:11:36] your hearts and your souls in obeying
[1:11:39] the truth through the spirit unto
[1:11:41] unfeign love of the brethren. see that
[1:11:43] you love one another with a pure heart
[1:11:46] fervently. Why? Because that's the word
[1:11:48] of God.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:54] I've been challenged. I have to
[1:11:58] confess many times throughout life. I've
[1:12:01] been very challenged.
[1:12:04] Sometimes I you may see me sitting
[1:12:07] behind the minister even as I was
[1:12:09] listening to our our brother France
[1:12:11] Leakar. Incidentally, they just are are
[1:12:14] have left. I suppose their plane has
[1:12:16] probably just left now,
[1:12:18] but they were going through all the
[1:12:20] various relationships and and things.
[1:12:23] And
[1:12:26] you know, it's it's it's tough. It's
[1:12:28] hard. It's hard sometime to keep all
[1:12:31] those relationships. I mean, you know,
[1:12:33] when he talked about how and I I read
[1:12:37] how brother Brandham says about, you
[1:12:39] know, how a man treats his wife and so
[1:12:41] on and how the wife, you know, she's
[1:12:43] supposed to
[1:12:45] be at the door and meet her husband and
[1:12:47] all these things. Uh, it's hard.
[1:12:54] That's why you were quiet
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; and that's why I just had my lips
[1:12:58] puckered and I wasn't even saying amen.
[1:13:03] Not because you don't agree.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; You do agree.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; And you can say, "Amen." But I don't
[1:13:09] want to be a hypocrite like, "Amen. Here
[1:13:11] I am, folks. I do all of this." Well, I
[1:13:14] don't do all of this. And uh uh you
[1:13:17] know, I just be honest. I My wife and I
[1:13:19] back my car out every day. You know, I
[1:13:21] wave like this and she waves like that
[1:13:23] and and that's our that's about it.
[1:13:29] So, I guess people are made up
[1:13:31] different. I don't I I don't know.
[1:13:32] They're just made up different. But I
[1:13:34] absorbed it and I realize whatever the
[1:13:37] word says, that's where success is.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; And if we start running into any snags
[1:13:43] or start running into any uh
[1:13:46] difficulties in our relationships or in
[1:13:49] our inter relationships with one
[1:13:51] another, I'll I'll say this to you.
[1:13:53] Retreat to the word. Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Retreat to the word every time. Find out
[1:13:58] what the word says and do that.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Whether you feel it or don't feel it,
[1:14:04] that's irrelevant. Do what the word
[1:14:07] says. And I I know that God will prosper
[1:14:11] you. Can you say amen to that?
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; So now we'll talk about the fullness in
[1:14:17] the end time. Just quickly,
[1:14:21] we do not deny
[1:14:23] that the fullness of the word has come.
[1:14:27] We may not understand the fullness, but
[1:14:31] the fullness is unfolding from glory to
[1:14:33] glory in the message proving his word.
[1:14:36] Just a few quotes now. He said, "You
[1:14:38] believe we're living in the last days
[1:14:40] when the son of man is to be manifested.
[1:14:44] That would be all the word that's
[1:14:48] gathered if in the last days when the
[1:14:51] son of man is to be manifested. He said
[1:14:54] that would be all the word that's
[1:14:58] gathered up through Luther and Wesley
[1:15:02] Baptist and all that and the
[1:15:04] Pentecostals all gathered up to the
[1:15:07] revelation of what it's all been. The
[1:15:10] seventh angel was to open the sixth seal
[1:15:12] mystery. Uh it's all to be gathered up
[1:15:16] in the son of man which is Christ. His
[1:15:19] fullness of time has come to the
[1:15:22] fullness of his word to manifest the
[1:15:25] fullness of his body.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? The fullness of the
[1:15:30] time has come to the fullness of his
[1:15:34] word to manifest the fullness of his
[1:15:36] body. And I can say whether I understand
[1:15:39] that completely. I'll say amen to it.
[1:15:42] That's God's messenger said it. I know
[1:15:45] we're at that time. We're in a harvest.
[1:15:47] The harvest time is always the fullness
[1:15:49] of time. Everything everything that's
[1:15:51] going to be gathered. Everything that
[1:15:52] has been multiplied is in its multiplied
[1:15:55] form in the harvest time. And so here we
[1:15:58] are. And here we find ourselves. Maybe
[1:16:01] you have your your uh unique situation,
[1:16:04] your home, your family, your children,
[1:16:07] whatever more uh our church, our realm
[1:16:11] of fellowship, our family, my friends,
[1:16:14] etc., etc. So, what do we do uh if we've
[1:16:17] run into a a a difficult what do we do
[1:16:20] when we say we the the rubber has hit
[1:16:23] the road? We what do we do in a case
[1:16:26] like that? I want to say unequivocally,
[1:16:29] I want to say unqualified,
[1:16:33] retreat
[1:16:35] to the word so that you can say this is
[1:16:39] what the message says.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Unvarnished, unpolished.
[1:16:45] This is what we've been taught.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; This is the word. I And I'm not ashamed
[1:16:50] to say that. I just want to say that. I
[1:16:53] want to declare it. This is what we live
[1:16:55] by. Amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; This is what has called us. This is our
[1:16:59] richness. This is the good land. This is
[1:17:02] the houses. This is the vineyards that
[1:17:05] God has given. We didn't who who paid
[1:17:08] anything for for Malachi 4.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Like brother Lipar was saying to the
[1:17:17] children,
[1:17:19] I mean, did you do you pay to have your
[1:17:23] food cooked and brought to you and
[1:17:25] served?
[1:17:27] Well, that's that's very
[1:17:32] that was very wonderful.
[1:17:36] Have we paid anything?
[1:17:40] Do we pay anything towards brother
[1:17:43] Brandham's coming?
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; We didn't, did we?
[1:17:50] How could we re how could we repay a man
[1:17:54] for going into the hospital
[1:17:57] and rushing in just in time to see her
[1:18:00] breathe her last and call her and she
[1:18:03] opens her eyes and speaks a few words
[1:18:07] and she passes out of this life. Just a
[1:18:11] young young woman.
[1:18:13] How could we pay anything for that? And
[1:18:16] God was grinding,
[1:18:19] assaying,
[1:18:21] tempting, trying
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; fiery trial,
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; And then he just gets home.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Gets a call. Come quick. Your baby
[1:18:32] Sharon Rose is dying. Oh, not my baby.
[1:18:36] Not Not Sh. Rush to the hospital. Cry
[1:18:39] out to God. He says, "The heavens are
[1:18:42] brass."
[1:18:44] And as he sees her eyes crossed from the
[1:18:48] excruciating pain that she was in and
[1:18:51] her eyes crossed
[1:18:54] and God was grinding the servant
[1:18:56] grinding, you know, and the devil said
[1:18:58] to him, you know, he won't hear you.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Friends, this isn't now we're not back
[1:19:06] in Hebrews 11. We're right here.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; This is the mouth. His mouth was the
[1:19:13] mouth that God used, but God was
[1:19:15] preparing that mouth and preparing that
[1:19:18] vessel. And he says, furthermore,
[1:19:21] he says
[1:19:23] there's been about 400 cases of of cross
[1:19:28] eyes
[1:19:30] and God has never failed to heal one of
[1:19:32] them.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; He said he said because of what he
[1:19:36] experienced.
[1:19:39] Was there even one of those parents that
[1:19:42] contributed anything to that kind of
[1:19:45] compassion? How he was gripped? God was
[1:19:49] grinding him out while he looked at her
[1:19:52] dying in front of his eyes in the
[1:19:54] hospital. God was preparing that vessel
[1:19:56] for hundreds of people who would have
[1:19:59] children with crossed eyes. And he would
[1:20:01] have such faith that God would heal that
[1:20:04] baby. God would heal that child. And it
[1:20:07] never cost us a penny.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; And we couldn't even say thank you
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; because God was saying the same thing. I
[1:20:17] give you a message. I've sent this
[1:20:19] fullness in this end time with the
[1:20:22] spirit of revelation with the spirit of
[1:20:24] adoption. And we don't take it. We must
[1:20:26] not take it for granted. We must not
[1:20:28] allow this relaxation
[1:20:31] to deteriorate that rugged faith.
[1:20:35] Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; I say may this church in the name of the
[1:20:41] Lord Jesus Christ rise to the occasion.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; This is a great opportunity for us.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It's a great
[1:20:50] opportunity. It's not a time to be sad
[1:20:54] and it's not a time to be withdrawn.
[1:20:56] It's not a time to dig down into a hole
[1:20:59] and and and be uh uh you know, pity me.
[1:21:03] No, no. It's a time to rise
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; because God is allowing you to go
[1:21:09] through what you're going through
[1:21:11] because he wants to give you a good mark
[1:21:13] in your report card.
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; This is a test,
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; You're going through a test. They say,
[1:21:22] "Oh, there's been a big economic
[1:21:24] meltdown." Yes, there has. But it's a
[1:21:26] test. You think God in heaven didn't
[1:21:29] know there's going to be the economy the
[1:21:30] way that it is and difficulty and some
[1:21:33] of you even had to move from your homes
[1:21:35] and whatever more. God knew all of that.
[1:21:38] God knew all of that. God's greater than
[1:21:41] that. God's greater than the economy.
[1:21:43] God's greater than the conditions that
[1:21:45] we're in.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; I want to give him glory.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; I want to praise him because he's in
[1:21:51] control.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:57] Hallelujah. I'm not here tonight just to
[1:22:00] preach you a service.
[1:22:02] I'm here tonight with a very
[1:22:06] something very real within my heart.
[1:22:10] I'm not here tonight because we have all
[1:22:11] the answers. We don't. I don't even
[1:22:14] pretend to have all the answers. Not at
[1:22:16] all. I probably got more questions than
[1:22:18] I have answers. But I know one thing.
[1:22:21] God,
[1:22:23] our God, and we have to say it
[1:22:25] different. My God.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; He knows it all.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; And he's got it in his hand. And he has
[1:22:33] you in his hand.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; In the message, the evening messenger,
[1:22:48] he said this is repeated each time
[1:22:50] through the Bible. We find that the
[1:22:53] sacred that in the sacred scriptures all
[1:22:56] the way through that just at the ending
[1:22:58] of the old age and a new one coming in
[1:23:01] that that age fades out and a new age
[1:23:04] comes in and God sends a messenger. And
[1:23:07] as always, every time that a messenger
[1:23:10] comes, it's always a call back to the
[1:23:14] word. Never fails. He says it's always
[1:23:17] the same. Call back to the word. Why
[1:23:19] call back to the word? cuz they drifted
[1:23:21] from the word.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying tonight. That's
[1:23:26] what we don't want to do.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; There's a possibility
[1:23:36] that we don't feed enough on the word.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; And I think that's a good possibility.
[1:23:43] And I would say that if you find
[1:23:45] yourself tonight and say, "Well, I
[1:23:48] really there's much of the word and much
[1:23:50] of the message I haven't heard." You
[1:23:52] should feed on it.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; You should make it a diet
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; and you will gain strength that you
[1:23:59] didn't even know existed. Like you ate
[1:24:01] your food today and you got strength
[1:24:04] from it. That's exactly what we need to
[1:24:07] do spiritually as well. You need to
[1:24:09] redeem the time. You need to you need to
[1:24:12] plan it. It won't it won't fall into
[1:24:14] your lap. It won't just come of its own
[1:24:17] accord. You have to make that a a
[1:24:20] purposeful decision, a conscious
[1:24:22] decision on your own behalf. And then he
[1:24:25] says, remember this is the complete
[1:24:29] revelation of Jesus Christ. There cannot
[1:24:32] be nothing added to it or taken from it.
[1:24:35] It's the complete revelation of Jesus
[1:24:39] Christ. complete revelation. So we can
[1:24:41] say on one hand, oh hallelujah, you
[1:24:44] know, we can do a jig and a dance and so
[1:24:46] on so forth. Oh, we've got the complete
[1:24:47] revelation. But in the time of fullness,
[1:24:52] always, always in the time of fullness,
[1:24:56] there is that lurking danger that's
[1:24:59] looming there. Lest we just lax back and
[1:25:03] say, "Oh, we've had the fullness of the
[1:25:05] word. Hallelujah. the preacher is going
[1:25:07] to get up and tell us all about it and
[1:25:09] he's going to preach us happy and we're
[1:25:11] going to have, you know,
[1:25:13] people sing and we're just going to have
[1:25:15] a wonderful time. That's all great and I
[1:25:18] hope that we will continue to do that,
[1:25:21] but don't ever let it take away
[1:25:26] from when when when things start going
[1:25:28] absolutely in reverse from what you
[1:25:32] expected,
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; right? Amen. from what you expected
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; in life
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; in your home,
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; in your job,
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; in your church, in your own individual.
[1:25:43] When things go absolutely backwards,
[1:25:46] then you have to know, be certain of
[1:25:48] God.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Be certain of God. God is
[1:25:54] God. Whether I'm drinking branch water
[1:25:57] and eating soda crackers or whether I've
[1:25:59] got a t-bone steak, the same God that
[1:26:02] gave one gave the other.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Then brother Brandham says in the
[1:26:10] message, "Shalom. Can I just have a few
[1:26:12] more minutes?"
[1:26:14] He said, "Listen, I'm your brother."
[1:26:17] Well, first he said, "We're creatures of
[1:26:19] time." And he said, "God's a creature of
[1:26:21] eternity. He never began and we and
[1:26:24] he'll never end. So why not just commit
[1:26:26] yourself to him?
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Look up and shine for the joy of the
[1:26:31] light of God's word that's shining
[1:26:34] today. Why can't people see that,
[1:26:37] friends? He said, listen, he said, I'm
[1:26:39] your brother.
[1:26:41] I love you. Wouldn't it be easier for me
[1:26:44] just to tolerate or go ahead and say, oh
[1:26:47] well, I'll compromise on this. I'm so
[1:26:50] glad he didn't.
[1:26:52] He said, "I'm not made out of that.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Can't you just compromise a little bit,
[1:26:58] Brother Brandham?" He says, "I'm just
[1:27:00] not made out of that." Oh. Uh I I want
[1:27:03] us to be able to to confess that and to
[1:27:07] say that the reason I'm here and the
[1:27:10] reason I'm not uh laying out at home or
[1:27:13] the reason I'm not taking this message
[1:27:15] in a relaxed way is because I'm not made
[1:27:18] that way.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And tonight you want to say, "Thank
[1:27:23] God."
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; And I didn't pay anything for it.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; I didn't buy it. I didn't vote for it. I
[1:27:32] didn't do anything for it. God just
[1:27:34] dropped it down and gave it to me. And
[1:27:37] I'd sooner have that than oil homes or
[1:27:40] cars or lands or money or anything. I'd
[1:27:43] sooner have that that that uh strength
[1:27:46] and that character that comes from the
[1:27:48] seed of God.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; So that you know whatever happens,
[1:27:52] you're going to be right here. You're
[1:27:54] going to be right at God's post of duty.
[1:27:57] Wherever that is.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Just give me another minute or two. He
[1:28:04] said, "I'm not made that way." No, sir.
[1:28:07] He said, "When it's the word, it's the
[1:28:09] word. God help us to stand for that.
[1:28:12] Which is true. And then he said, "Yes,
[1:28:15] sir. It would be fine. Sure, you'd get
[1:28:18] more pats on the back. But what will I
[1:28:21] do standing there that day when them
[1:28:24] bony fingers point in my face and say,
[1:28:27] "You knew better, but you failed to tell
[1:28:31] me." He said, "No." He said, "I'll be
[1:28:35] like Paul.
[1:28:37] I've not shunned to declare to you the
[1:28:41] whole council of God.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; And he already on earth declared, I'm
[1:28:47] not going to I'm not going to uh uh uh I
[1:28:52] I'm I'm going to be like Paul. I'm not
[1:28:55] going to be like that. I'm going to be
[1:28:57] like Paul say, "I've not shun to declare
[1:28:59] unto you the whole council of God. No
[1:29:02] man's blood upon me. Let it go where it
[1:29:05] may be." And that's the truth.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; And I uh I I'm I'm being very honest and
[1:29:12] open and transparent tonight. I read
[1:29:14] that and I feel a sense of conviction
[1:29:18] because I've got neighbors around me. I
[1:29:20] have witnessed to some and there's
[1:29:22] others I haven't. And I've wondered
[1:29:25] about this. You know, I don't want their
[1:29:27] blood on my hands. And I've thought
[1:29:30] about that,
[1:29:32] don't we?
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. you've thought about those things.
[1:29:35] So we want to be a witness. I it's not
[1:29:37] always what a person says but you want
[1:29:39] to
[1:29:41] live in such a way so that if there is
[1:29:43] any hunger there or any uh if they see
[1:29:48] anything that they would ask or open the
[1:29:50] door and I always look for that.
[1:29:57] Brother Brandham talks about this day,
[1:29:59] this day that we're in. And I can't
[1:30:01] possibly uh uh cover this now, but I'm
[1:30:05] just going to mention a couple of the a
[1:30:08] couple of uh thoughts that you can be
[1:30:10] pondering.
[1:30:13] Brother Bam talks about the shrine of
[1:30:16] Hollywood.
[1:30:19] We we talk about, you know, things that
[1:30:23] uh I think that I I personally I get
[1:30:26] affected by the environment.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; I get affected.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; I I I I like to maybe hear some news and
[1:30:35] then I hear something I'm sorry I heard.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; And so I don't have any newspaper coming
[1:30:41] to my home, but I'll go and buy a
[1:30:43] newspaper maybe a couple times a week.
[1:30:45] I'll be in a a service station. So I'll
[1:30:47] I'll pick up a newspaper and somewhere
[1:30:50] along yeah you know you find there's
[1:30:52] interesting things and you find out
[1:30:53] what's happening in the community etc
[1:30:55] etc happening in the city and then you
[1:30:58] just hit the skids and you run into
[1:30:59] something and just say h what well
[1:31:03] what's this age coming to
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; this is insanity
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; look at
[1:31:11] you know we we had a paper the other day
[1:31:13] and and and there's you know one one
[1:31:15] whole section generally when I get to
[1:31:17] the section that says life, I just throw
[1:31:19] it because I know it's death.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; That's true. True.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; That'll be one and it's it's fashion.
[1:31:25] And brother Brandham says that fashion
[1:31:29] the the they've taken the virtue of
[1:31:32] women
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; and called it fashion
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; the strength the virtue of women and
[1:31:38] called it and he says in this age and he
[1:31:41] talked to the Pentecostal people at that
[1:31:43] time he says and they bowed down to the
[1:31:46] shrine of Hollywood
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; you know what a shrine is it's a place
[1:31:50] of worship
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; right
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; so it's no wonder that Satan has called
[1:31:54] them stars cars and idols and the
[1:31:57] American idol and the Canadian idol and
[1:31:59] the British idol. You know why they even
[1:32:02] even he knows it
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; and he's telling them you're you're
[1:32:06] going to worship this thing.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; You're going to worship this program.
[1:32:10] There's going to be millions of you
[1:32:12] watch this stuff
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; and you're you're going to you're going
[1:32:15] to commit fornication
[1:32:18] because you're going to give your heart
[1:32:19] and soul to the thing. And he just gets
[1:32:22] them. I was in a huge factory
[1:32:26] some years ago in Los Angeles
[1:32:29] and a Jewish friend of mine, the owner
[1:32:32] of this factory,
[1:32:35] it was maybe you've heard of the garment
[1:32:37] of a sasson
[1:32:39] and uh so we we went we're going to go
[1:32:43] out and have lunch together. He was
[1:32:44] Jewish too, I guess. I don't know. But
[1:32:46] anyway,
[1:32:48] so we're walking through this factory
[1:32:50] and this whole aisle here on each side
[1:32:53] of the aisle was young fellows and young
[1:32:56] ladies at drawing boards and they're
[1:32:59] drawing and sketching because they're
[1:33:00] artists and they're sketching fashions
[1:33:03] that they're going to make in this
[1:33:04] factory. So, I'm I'm going through I'm
[1:33:07] walking through and they're looking
[1:33:10] and of course this was California, so I
[1:33:12] don't know what you'd expect, but were
[1:33:14] they dressed in weird stuff?
[1:33:16] And I just looked at them, I thought,
[1:33:18] "How in the world could that person ever
[1:33:20] draw anything that would be worth
[1:33:22] wearing?"
[1:33:24] And I'm walking through. Finally, I say
[1:33:26] to Ceson, I said, "Hey,
[1:33:29] how do you know what the people are
[1:33:31] going to buy? What are they going to
[1:33:32] wear? How do you know they will? He He
[1:33:36] just snapped right back. He says, "We
[1:33:38] tell them what they're gonna wear."
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, wow.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; And that's the truth.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And those those young people, I felt
[1:33:49] sorry for them. So twisted and so
[1:33:52] perverted. And then and then here we are
[1:33:55] as message believers and good godly
[1:33:59] people and we're subjected
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; to what some man
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; has said and they're all the same. We're
[1:34:06] going to tell them what they're going to
[1:34:08] wear and they fill the stores and all
[1:34:10] the ladies fashions and men's fashions.
[1:34:13] Fill the stores, plug them full and walk
[1:34:16] through. And that's why some of you
[1:34:17] sisters, you go there and you've got
[1:34:19] tears running down your face before
[1:34:21] you're done. I can't find anything
[1:34:23] worthwhile.
[1:34:24] I can't find anything that would give me
[1:34:27] a clear conscience. And that's why
[1:34:29] brother Brandham said way back then, he
[1:34:31] wasn't trying to be he was trying not
[1:34:33] trying to be humorous. He said they
[1:34:34] still have sewing machines and and and
[1:34:36] goods.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; In other words, material because he knew
[1:34:40] it was going to come to that. Is this
[1:34:42] all right? Just for a moment.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:34:46] So,
[1:34:47] I'm I'm going to close in five minutes.
[1:34:49] I'm just going to list off a number of
[1:34:51] things and then if God so grant me to be
[1:34:55] able to stand before you again and I
[1:34:57] trust that we will you'll have all of
[1:35:00] this background.
[1:35:03] So in our report card
[1:35:07] uh
[1:35:10] how do we handle
[1:35:12] these all had good good report.
[1:35:16] So it would be a question how do we
[1:35:18] handle
[1:35:20] success?
[1:35:23] How are we handling
[1:35:26] the pressure
[1:35:27] of the soft life?
[1:35:30] How do we respond to failure?
[1:35:34] Have you ever had failure?
[1:35:37] If you haven't, you will have. You'll
[1:35:38] experience. So, what do we do?
[1:35:44] I will help you when you have failure.
[1:35:49] God allowed it. You might say, "No, I
[1:35:52] brought it on myself." That's fine. Or
[1:35:56] you might say, "He brought it on. She
[1:35:58] brought it on. This person did it or
[1:36:00] that person did it." And that also might
[1:36:02] be true.
[1:36:05] Or you might say, "I'm just reaping. I'm
[1:36:07] reaping what I sowed." And that might be
[1:36:10] true. God happened to know all of that.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; And when you came to a place, and this
[1:36:17] was just an absolute crushing
[1:36:21] failure.
[1:36:23] Now, this is why brother Biscll is
[1:36:26] speaking this so that you can look at
[1:36:28] that and say,
[1:36:32] I can't change it.
[1:36:35] And God has allowed this. God knew it.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Whether I did it or he did it or she did
[1:36:42] it or my relative or somebody else did
[1:36:45] it. One thing, my God knew it.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; My God saw it.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; And my God, my God is going to use it.
[1:36:56] Whether this is a cave in the desert,
[1:36:59] whether this is wandering around in
[1:37:00] sheep skin. You know something, friends?
[1:37:03] I've been in situations where I'd have
[1:37:05] been happy to exchange my place for a
[1:37:08] sheep skin.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; You don't believe me.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You don't believe me? Just try me.
[1:37:20] I'd be happy to exchange some of the
[1:37:23] spots I've been in for a sheep skin or a
[1:37:25] goat skin and go wandering out in some
[1:37:27] wilderness. I wouldn't want to be in
[1:37:29] town doing it, but I' i'd be out in the
[1:37:31] wilderness.
[1:37:38] How do we respond to failure?
[1:37:44] How do we respond to offense?
[1:37:49] Jesus said when the men came
[1:37:55] and he said they asked about John are
[1:37:59] you he that we should look for or do we
[1:38:01] look for another?
[1:38:03] And he said, "Go back and tell John."
[1:38:06] The blind receive their sight, and the
[1:38:08] lame walk, and the lepers are cleansed,
[1:38:10] and the deaf the deaf hear, and the dead
[1:38:14] are raised up, and the poor have the
[1:38:16] gospel preached to them. And
[1:38:19] blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[1:38:22] offended in me.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Why did he say that? Because people were
[1:38:27] offended in him.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; He offended. Jesus offended people.
[1:38:32] says, "I don't like that. I'm offended
[1:38:35] with that.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; That's why they left him."
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Many were offended.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; And I've I've spoken it years ago, and I
[1:38:44] I just marvel. It used to be something,
[1:38:47] you know, that I was just intrigued with
[1:38:50] how the Bible says he had about 5,000
[1:38:53] people
[1:38:54] and then and then a few verses later
[1:38:58] he has 4,988
[1:39:01] left him.
[1:39:03] And the Bible says clearly he was left
[1:39:05] with the 12.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; So how do we respond? I'm not I'm not
[1:39:10] even preaching on it. How do we respond
[1:39:13] to being rejected?
[1:39:17] I never forget, and I've mentioned this
[1:39:19] a time or two, and if you've heard it
[1:39:20] before, just uh bear with me a moment, a
[1:39:23] a couple came into the into the log
[1:39:26] church, and there was no service, but
[1:39:27] they came into the log church, and we
[1:39:29] were there, and and this young lady, and
[1:39:31] she's a lovely young woman, and she come
[1:39:34] and and just looked at that log church.
[1:39:36] Oh, she said, "Isn't this beautiful?"
[1:39:38] And and her husband, I mean, her
[1:39:41] boyfriend because they were going to get
[1:39:42] married. I didn't know why they were
[1:39:43] there. Oh, she said, "This is just so
[1:39:45] beautiful." And they were so taken by
[1:39:48] it, you know, and she said, "We we want
[1:39:51] to be married here."
[1:39:54] And she thought that I just rejoice with
[1:39:56] her.
[1:39:58] And I said, "Well, we I don't conduct
[1:40:02] any marriages other than the people
[1:40:03] here, the people who come here and have
[1:40:07] this faith and believe what we're
[1:40:09] believing."
[1:40:10] And it was like I struck her in the head
[1:40:12] with a hammer.
[1:40:15] And she said, "You're rejecting me."
[1:40:20] And I was smitten. I said, "Well,
[1:40:24] I guess so."
[1:40:26] He said, "I can't believe that you would
[1:40:29] reject us.
[1:40:31] You are rejecting us." And that poor
[1:40:34] girl was absolutely smitten. She
[1:40:37] couldn't even bring a tear to her eyes.
[1:40:40] She couldn't believe. She was nice,
[1:40:43] lovely, fresh, bright,
[1:40:46] someone that you'd shake hands with or
[1:40:48] have over to your house. But I just had
[1:40:51] to let her know we I can't marry you.
[1:40:55] Even though you love this place and love
[1:40:57] this building and it is everything that
[1:40:59] you would wish, so quaint and nice. I
[1:41:03] never forgot that. Never forgot that.
[1:41:06] You're rejecting us.
[1:41:09] You're rejecting me. And I didn't really
[1:41:11] see it that way, but it was it was
[1:41:14] difficult. So, how do we how do we
[1:41:16] handle it's not easy to be rejected.
[1:41:19] Samuel, he was rejected. And
[1:41:23] God had to speak to him.
[1:41:28] And I'm I'm leaving now. We're going to
[1:41:30] close.
[1:41:33] But I'd like to ask you
[1:41:35] because you know we have a nice group
[1:41:38] here this evening.
[1:41:41] How how do you handle being alone?
[1:41:47] Say, "Oh, Brother Ed, don't crunch me.
[1:41:49] Don't don't don't come don't come down
[1:41:52] where I live like that cuz I know there
[1:41:54] are those that are alone.
[1:41:56] You're alone. There are those that
[1:41:59] perhaps would like to be married aren't
[1:42:01] married.
[1:42:02] There are those who have been married
[1:42:04] that don't have their partners.
[1:42:08] There's uh young people and older people
[1:42:12] and you can be amongst a whole group of
[1:42:14] people. You can be amongst a crowd of
[1:42:16] people and be terribly alone.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; You understand me?
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; I listened to a program on the Canadian
[1:42:27] Broadcasting Corporation many years ago.
[1:42:29] I never forgot it. 30, 40 years ago.
[1:42:33] in Toronto and they opened up the phone
[1:42:35] lines
[1:42:37] and the and the subject was loneliness.
[1:42:42] And their lines were plugged.
[1:42:46] People called and called and called and
[1:42:49] they asked, "Well, where are you? I'm
[1:42:51] here. I'm I have my apartment.
[1:42:54] I work here. I have this, but I'm
[1:42:57] lonely,
[1:43:01] you know." something friends.
[1:43:04] Uh
[1:43:06] I could take in the scripture
[1:43:09] and God had to get Moses alone. God had
[1:43:13] to get brother Brandham says he gets his
[1:43:15] prophets and so and sometimes we feel
[1:43:17] well that's so distant from us. You
[1:43:19] know, I'm not there. I'm not way back
[1:43:21] there. But Jesus got left alone.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; He knew what it was to be alone.
[1:43:29] And I can show you in the scripture and
[1:43:32] one very very man one man that was very
[1:43:35] very much alone was the very messenger
[1:43:37] that brought this message
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; and I was with him when his heart was
[1:43:44] breaking
[1:43:46] because someone tried to worship him
[1:43:50] and he couldn't hardly tell anybody and
[1:43:53] we drove in the car and he was going
[1:43:55] with a nervous conversation. And he
[1:43:57] says, "Please forgive me, brother Ed."
[1:43:58] He said, "It just was so I'm I'm so
[1:44:00] troubled." He said, "What would cause
[1:44:04] what have I done?" He said, just like
[1:44:05] that, "What have I done that would cause
[1:44:08] a woman to give to take praise and
[1:44:11] worship away from my Lord? What have I
[1:44:14] done?" And he just on the verge of
[1:44:16] breaking down. Do you know what,
[1:44:18] friends? He was alone.
[1:44:21] He was very much alone.
[1:44:24] And when you're alone,
[1:44:26] see, I want I'd like to speak on, but
[1:44:28] I've got to close, but I want to be able
[1:44:30] to send you from this place. There's a
[1:44:31] whole array of things. So, we say, "Oh,
[1:44:35] yeah. These heroes of faith,
[1:44:37] they were rejected.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; They were cast off.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; They were alone.
[1:44:45] They had all of these things that we
[1:44:47] experience.
[1:44:49] We're in a different kind of a building.
[1:44:50] We're in a different environment. We're
[1:44:52] in a different society, but we have
[1:44:55] these things are a reality in our lives.
[1:44:58] And I'm speaking that to you to say
[1:45:01] this. He knew you be feel alone. And
[1:45:05] that's why he said, "I will never leave
[1:45:08] you nor forsake you." because he knew
[1:45:11] not necessarily that everybody would
[1:45:13] leave you, but he would he knew that you
[1:45:15] would be isolated and you'd be alone and
[1:45:19] you'd be bearing your own burden and no
[1:45:21] one fully understands. But I'm glad we
[1:45:25] got one that understands us
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; and he'll never leave you alone. He
[1:45:32] understands even better than you
[1:45:34] understand yourself. I love him.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Little over the time and I'm just going
[1:45:40] to start again another time. Will you
[1:45:43] stand with me?
[1:45:50] Oh
[1:45:53] Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus,
[1:45:59] I come to you.
[1:46:02] I'm speaking with you
[1:46:04] before these people and on behalf of
[1:46:07] these brothers and sisters in Christ,
[1:46:10] dear friends, and many that are not
[1:46:13] here. Lord, dear friends, you've given
[1:46:17] us a promise that you'll never leave us
[1:46:20] nor forsake us. I'm asking that you will
[1:46:23] guide our footsteps. Lord, I'm praying
[1:46:25] especially for those that have felt led
[1:46:29] and directed to come tonight, this
[1:46:31] Wednesday night. Father, I pray that
[1:46:34] there will be now something that the
[1:46:38] Holy Spirit has planted deep into their
[1:46:41] heart that they might know the answer
[1:46:45] for every situation in their lives. You
[1:46:49] have already given us. You have provided
[1:46:52] for us because you're Jehovah Gyra and
[1:46:55] there's none like you. You are alone, oh
[1:46:58] God. And you you you are you are alone.
[1:47:01] There's no God like you. There's there's
[1:47:04] no one that would take your place in our
[1:47:06] lives. And so we want to thank you
[1:47:09] tonight, Lord, for us allowing us to
[1:47:12] gather like this. And I pray that your
[1:47:15] Holy Spirit will hover over us, Lord,
[1:47:19] and cause these words to be a reality.
[1:47:22] And I pray that there'll be a virtue and
[1:47:24] a strength that will come into your
[1:47:27] children, your daughters, your sons and
[1:47:30] daughters tonight, Lord, these families.
[1:47:32] Oh God, hear us when we pray. Oh God,
[1:47:35] we're praying, oh God, for our loved
[1:47:38] ones and for all those that have touched
[1:47:41] us and those that we love and those that
[1:47:43] love you and those that are your bride
[1:47:45] and your body. Lord Jesus, bless your
[1:47:48] people, I pray, oh God, in the name of
[1:47:52] Jesus Christ and for your glory, we
[1:47:55] thank you. We thank you. Amen and amen.
[1:47:59] Amen. I wonder, brother Derek, if you
[1:48:01] could just help us to sing Jehovah Gyra,
[1:48:05] if you would please.
[1:48:13] Was it all right?
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; I kind of smiled at uh at the I watched
[1:48:24] you during the services and you're a
[1:48:27] hearty people.
[1:48:30] My goodness, you're hurting people.
[1:48:34] You sat and listened and it was so
[1:48:37] wonderful. I'm so proud of you. Amen.
[1:48:40] Our brother Fransis, isn't it amazing? I
[1:48:43] mean, just went from one statement to
[1:48:45] the next to the next to the next. And do
[1:48:48] you know why he covered it all? Cuz he's
[1:48:51] Swiss.
[1:48:53] What is Swiss known? What's Switzerland
[1:48:55] known for?
[1:48:57] [Music]
[1:48:59] Not to keep time with, but when you're
[1:49:01] speaking, you don't leave a cog out.
[1:49:05] Right?
[1:49:08] You don't leave a spring. You don't
[1:49:10] leave anything out. You put all the
[1:49:12] jewels in and all the cogs in.
[1:49:15] Otherwise, if you don't, it won't work.
[1:49:18] [Laughter]
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; So, I I'm glad that brother Fras now
[1:49:24] he's just he's already gone. So now
[1:49:26] we've got it and we've got it on on uh
[1:49:29] DVD for you. All right, let's just sing
[1:49:32] it and then we're going to close in
[1:49:33] prayer.
[1:49:37] Jehovah,
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:48] [Music]
[1:49:50] you are more
[1:49:53] than enough.
[1:49:56] for me.
[1:50:02] You're
[1:50:09] my
[1:50:13] [Music]
[1:50:18] I am set free.
[1:50:24] [Music]

[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:50:57] more than enough.
[1:51:01] You are more

[1:51:07] Glory.
[1:51:11] [Music]
[1:51:13] You are more
[1:51:16] than enough.
[1:51:20] You are much more.
[1:51:25] You are more
[1:51:28] than enough.
[1:51:32] Let us sing those lines again. You are
[1:51:35] more than enough.
[1:51:37] You are more than enough. Oh yes Lord.
[1:51:48] You are more
[1:51:51] than enough
[1:51:54] for me.
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; I just want to say God bless you.
[1:52:08] Hallelujah.
[1:52:10] May God
[1:52:12] be with you in the next days. May he
[1:52:15] prosper your life. And I pray that
[1:52:18] you'll take these these words. Please
[1:52:22] take these words and say those
[1:52:25] scriptures are true.
[1:52:27] Those quotes are true.
[1:52:30] And help me to absorb them. Help them to
[1:52:33] become part of my fiber.
[1:52:36] And if I've been weakened,
[1:52:39] I have been
[1:52:41] uh you know wearied,
[1:52:44] let that strength
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; cuz he's not weary.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; He's not lost any strength. He's not
[1:52:51] discouraged.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; And whatever you and I have need of,
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; he's Jehovah Gyra. He's going to provide
[1:53:00] for us. Who might want to be remembered
[1:53:02] in prayer as I just close in prayer? Our
[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:11] dear Lord,
[1:53:15] hands
[1:53:17] are raised and they represent something,
[1:53:21] a heart that is beating,
[1:53:23] a heart that is yearning,
[1:53:25] a heart that is hungry, perhaps a soul
[1:53:28] that is thirsty.
[1:53:31] Father, someone needing an answer.
[1:53:33] They've got a question. They have a they
[1:53:36] need an answer. And Lord, uh received an
[1:53:40] email tonight just before service. Oh
[1:53:43] God, a brother who's standing here is
[1:53:47] dear family. They need an answer from
[1:53:49] you. I pray, Father, you'll shine down,
[1:53:52] oh God, that you'll come as the great
[1:53:55] counselor and that you'll take charge of
[1:53:58] the situation in the name of Jesus
[1:54:01] Christ. Oh God, I pray that you will
[1:54:03] cause minds to be changed. Oh Lord, I
[1:54:06] pray you'll work on behalf of my brother
[1:54:08] and his wife and family. And oh God, in
[1:54:12] the name of Jesus Christ, may you turn
[1:54:15] the thing around. Oh God, our brother
[1:54:18] Jerry is needing a job. I pray, Father,
[1:54:21] you'll provide work for him and allow
[1:54:23] his family to be able to be by his side
[1:54:27] very soon in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:29] And every hand that has been raised, you
[1:54:32] are such a personal God. You're such a
[1:54:34] personal savior. You know every detail
[1:54:37] even better than we know it ourselves.
[1:54:41] You will undertake.
[1:54:43] I know that you will. I know that you
[1:54:46] will. And when we've crossed over to on
[1:54:49] the other side, we'll then realize more
[1:54:53] fully and more completely and perfectly
[1:54:55] how much you really cared for us. Thank
[1:54:58] you, Lord Jesus. We're asking it in your
[1:55:01] name that you'll be glorified. Amen. And
[1:55:06] amen.
[1:55:08] God bless you. Going to dismiss you in
[1:55:12] the name of Jesus Christ. You're all
[1:55:14] dismissed. Thank you for being here.
[1:55:17] Lord willing, you'll be here on the
[1:55:19] Lord's day. Fill this place. My wife and
[1:55:23] I can be taking a rest for a few days.
[1:55:25] And I'm sure you're not going to
[1:55:27] uh you won't you won't be upset with
[1:55:30] that. God bless you. You're dismissed.
[1:55:35] Thanks, Brother Derek.

[1:56:03] Hallelujah.
