[0:21] [Music]
[0:33] service deacons and the ushers for the
[0:35] convention. So please any of you who
[0:37] have been contacted uh will be serving
[0:40] as uh ushers uh and all of the deacons
[0:44] uh to meet in the uh chapel immediately
[0:48] after the service. Um apparently up at
[0:51] the Pacific Academy Auditorium
[0:54] uh they've told us that there is only
[0:56] parking for 500 cars and that means that
[0:59] we may run into a parking problem. As a
[1:01] result, we'd like to have as many people
[1:03] as possible carpool on the way there.
[1:07] Um, and as well what you can do is use
[1:09] this parking lot as maybe a a place
[1:12] where you can drop your car off and then
[1:15] uh and this would apply for young
[1:17] people. So if you know if you're driving
[1:20] a brother or a sister and you got one
[1:21] person in a car, pick up some people,
[1:24] arrange to meet here and then go over
[1:26] together. And I think that would be uh
[1:29] uh help us a great deal as we don't want
[1:32] to have uh visitors uh walking a long
[1:35] ways. um and and really plugging up.
[1:38] There's a little bit of parking on the
[1:39] street there, but even if you know the
[1:41] area, there's not a lot of parking uh
[1:43] once you get outside. So
[1:46] um
[1:48] there is uh this is not rel well it is
[1:51] related to the convention, but there's
[1:52] going to be a young people's choir uh 7
[1:55] o'clock at the church this Friday.
[1:58] Please be there. They really need it's
[2:00] really the only practice they're going
[2:01] to have. So, if all the young people who
[2:03] are in the choir could uh could be here
[2:06] at 7 o'clock on Friday, it'd be greatly
[2:08] appreciated. Parents with toddlers, um I
[2:12] mentioned it last Sunday. Some of you
[2:15] are really good. As soon as a child
[2:16] makes a noise, you leave. Others say,
[2:18] "Well, I can listen. I'm just really
[2:20] pressing in." and you don't realize that
[2:21] your child who may be not crying but is
[2:24] happy and uh but is distracting uh you
[2:29] know everyone all around you because
[2:31] they're very happy and very vocal. So
[2:33] please if your child is vocal uh remove
[2:37] them.
[2:39] Um and you know because if you're taking
[2:41] up a spot or they're sitting on your
[2:43] knee you know it's distracting people.
[2:45] We're going to be really packed in here
[2:47] uh come the convention. So uh we really
[2:50] as much help as possible uh with that.
[2:54] Uh also sisters, if you don't have
[2:57] anyone billeted with you um and are
[3:01] looking for something to do, uh it's uh
[3:05] we would really appreciate if you could
[3:08] make a casserole, bring it here to the
[3:10] church and leave it here uh on it.
[3:12] There'll be tables set up so that people
[3:14] who are building and have, you know, are
[3:17] feeding their guests and driving people
[3:19] back and forth, uh, and are going to be
[3:21] extremely busy, uh, can can maybe have
[3:25] some of that burden, uh, lightened a
[3:27] little bit.
[3:29] Um,
[3:31] Amen. Let's be in prayer. Amen. Looking
[3:34] forward to it.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a wonderful time in the
[3:37] Lord. All that thrills my soul is Jesus.

[16:16] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[16:22] Hallelujah.
[16:25] And I'm going to ask brother Tom to come
[16:27] and pray this morning.
[16:30] Open the service in a word of prayer. If
[16:32] you've got a need this morning, you just
[16:34] lift it before our God as we go to
[16:37] prayer. If you're listening in on the
[16:39] internet and you've got a need, you just
[16:40] take it before.
[16:42] Father, as we come before his throne,
[16:45] there's a prayer cloth here. Our brother
[16:47] Glenn Grunard is asking that we pray for
[16:49] his brother Len, who many of us know
[16:52] he's in the uh intensive care unit in
[16:54] Colona. He was in critical condition
[16:57] after a quatting accident. And brother
[16:59] Glenn wants to pray for spiritual and
[17:02] physical healing this morning. But let's
[17:04] unite our hearts this morning. Amen.
[17:12] Hallelujah.
[17:14] Lord, what a grand and glorious
[17:16] privilege it is to stand in your August
[17:19] presence this morning.
[17:22] And Father, something within our hearts
[17:24] cries out, "Pass me not, oh gentle
[17:27] Savior.
[17:29] Hear our humble cry.
[17:31] Lord, we are a needy people, needy of a
[17:34] great God to come down, meet us in a
[17:37] supernatural way, and letting the word
[17:40] have its effect within our lives. And
[17:43] so, Lord, we ask that you would come and
[17:45] suck with us this morning. Break the
[17:48] bread of life to us, Lord. And if our
[17:50] eyes are holden, we pray that you'll
[17:53] open them this morning. that our eyes of
[17:55] understanding would be opened up to see
[17:58] your glory, to see your grace, that we
[18:01] might magnify you and lift up that holy
[18:04] name of Jesus Christ this morning. Lord,
[18:07] we can truly say it's amazing grace, how
[18:11] sweet the sound that saved a wretch like
[18:14] me. So Lord, as we have been preparing
[18:17] and expecting you to come, service after
[18:21] service, and we've been preparing for
[18:24] these meetings that lay ahead, we just
[18:26] pray God that it would be such a
[18:28] refreshing to your people, Lord, as the
[18:31] ministers prepare. We want to prepare
[18:33] our own hearts that you will speak and
[18:36] move. Lord that we would be a different
[18:38] people and the things Lord God of this
[18:42] world would grow so strangely dim in the
[18:45] light of your glory and grace. We ask
[18:48] Lord that you will meet us in a special
[18:50] way and anoint our pastor. Anoint the
[18:53] word. Meet us Lord. We ask in Jesus holy
[18:57] name. And father for this request that
[18:59] brother Lynn Lord is has a need and
[19:02] Glenn has asked that we pray. Lord raise
[19:05] him up. open his eyes. Give him eyes sab
[19:09] to see. Lord, we pray God that you will
[19:11] move supernaturally, that you would not
[19:14] only awaken him, Lord, but God, you
[19:17] would spiritually awaken him to the
[19:19] realities of Christ. And so, Father, we
[19:23] just commit this need to you, may you be
[19:25] glorified.
[19:27] Father, for those that have joined this
[19:28] morning and will join, we just pray that
[19:32] the word would have its deep effect upon
[19:36] every heart and life. And so, Lord, we
[19:39] ask that now you take control of the
[19:40] service, be glorified amongst us, and
[19:43] bless the visitors that are in our midst
[19:46] this morning. In Jesus name we pray.
[19:50] Amen.
[19:55] And you may be seated.
[19:57] [Music]

[32:34] I can see a lurking coyote all around
[32:37] the purple haze. I could hear a lobo
[32:41] hollering down where the long street and

[33:38] Hallelujah.
[33:40] I stepped on
[33:42] [Music]
[33:45] the

[33:50] also low
[33:52] for the far away
[33:57] where the shadows
[33:59] fall the deepest
[34:02] or the mountain crest.
[34:06] I can see a lurking coyote all around
[34:09] the purple haze. I could hear a low
[34:13] hollering where the longh and somewhere
[34:17] up the canon I can hear a lion whales
[34:28] at the air.
[34:31] [Music]
[34:43] Perfect
[34:45] grown up body.
[34:52] The world can understand it forever to

[35:43] But it will still be
[35:48] the world understand

[35:53] that
[35:55] might be offering me when I up
[36:00] here.
[36:05] Hallelujah.
[36:07] I stepped on into
[36:10] life.
[36:14] Hallelujah.
[36:18] [Music]
[36:52] Good morning.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Wasn't that wonderful?
[36:56] &gt;&gt; And that was uh Brother Ules and uh
[36:59] Sister Patricia Briner's uh two girls in
[37:01] case you didn't know. And uh he has
[37:04] three girls. And you know what that
[37:06] makes Brother Ules? Makes him a real man
[37:08] according to our pastor. And we
[37:10] appreciate him. It's a wonderful uh we
[37:13] appreciate the the church of God and
[37:16] just wanted to come up here and and I
[37:18] have a couple things that I wanted to
[37:20] say. I don't want to be lengthy, but uh
[37:23] I wanted to say brother Mike G's class
[37:26] once again has went on their own kind of
[37:28] and has uh they had donations and within
[37:32] his class of about $100 and the $100
[37:35] that he has is going toward missions in
[37:38] uh India and he's going to uh they're
[37:41] going to get as many books as they can
[37:43] for India for uh with that $100. And I
[37:47] would just like to open with a little
[37:49] scripture.
[37:51] And the scripture is a well-known
[37:53] scripture. It's actually a scripture
[37:55] that they use a lot of times for
[37:57] dedicating children. And uh it's Mark
[38:01] chapter 10. You don't have to open it,
[38:03] but I'll just read it. And they brought,
[38:06] excuse me, and they brought little
[38:07] children to him that should that he
[38:09] should touch them. And his disciples
[38:12] rebuked those that brought them. But
[38:15] when Jesus saw it, he was much
[38:17] displeased, and said unto them, Suffer
[38:20] the little children to come unto me, and
[38:23] forbid them not, for such is the kingdom
[38:25] of God. And verily I say unto you,
[38:28] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[38:31] of God as a little child, he shall not
[38:34] enter therein. And he took them up in
[38:37] his arms, put his hands upon them, and
[38:40] blessed them. And uh we just thank the
[38:43] Lord for the little children. It's
[38:44] amazing because the next uh portion of
[38:47] scripture after this is the rich young
[38:50] ruler. And the rich young ruler came to
[38:52] God, you know, and ask him what he must
[38:54] do for eternal life. And uh he didn't
[38:57] come as a little child because a little
[39:00] child is full of obedience and they obey
[39:03] their father. They love their father.
[39:05] I've told my children in my Sunday
[39:06] school class over the years, I said,
[39:08] "How do you prove your love to your
[39:09] parents?" I said, uh, you might tell
[39:12] them you love them day in and day out. I
[39:14] said, 'But when you ask when they ask
[39:16] you to do something and you obey them. I
[39:18] said, 'Th that's how you prove your love
[39:20] to your parents and that's how we prove
[39:22] our love to God. And I just wanted to
[39:24] read uh a couple little things brother
[39:26] Brandham, one of the things Brother
[39:28] Brandham had and uh about children, he
[39:32] said, "Isn't that strange them little
[39:34] boys up not over 10, 12 years old, you
[39:38] say they don't?" Oh yes they do. Suffer
[39:41] the little children to come unto me and
[39:44] forbid them not. For such is the kingdom
[39:46] of God.
[39:48] And their their little hearts hasn't
[39:50] been pulled through too much stuff yet.
[39:53] They're tender and they can't they can
[39:56] easily receive Christ. The spirit knocks
[40:00] and all they know to do is to say yes,
[40:03] Lord. I love those little fellows uh
[40:07] that do that. And I just wanted to uh
[40:11] say something this morning. I love
[40:13] Brother Richard. Have grown to uh to
[40:16] love him as a brother and as a a Sunday
[40:19] school. He's a Sunday school
[40:20] superintendent. He's taught for years
[40:24] and uh he's over in, as you know, he's
[40:26] over in the uh Siberia right now. And
[40:29] he's actually he used his own money. I
[40:31] talked to his wife and used his own
[40:33] money to get over there. He uses
[40:35] vacation time to go over there. And you
[40:38] know the uh as a son of God, we are
[40:41] sheep. And as a sheep, you're a
[40:44] sacrificial animal. And I love to see,
[40:46] you know, uh somebody that uh that puts
[40:49] out and that sacrifices unto God and for
[40:52] this message because it's a wonderful
[40:54] message. But uh I was just thinking
[40:56] about brother Richard a little bit and
[40:58] how brother Brandham says, you know, is
[41:00] a person sired, right? And sired means
[41:03] what father does he have? And I was
[41:05] thinking of brother Charlie Drake. And I
[41:07] don't know how many here knew Charlie
[41:08] Drake or remember brother Charlie Drake.
[41:10] He was a wonderful brother. He was a
[41:13] deacon brother. And uh brother Charlie
[41:16] would uh I remember one time over in the
[41:18] log church. He came up to me, you know,
[41:21] and I'm kind of like a lot of believers.
[41:23] I like to eat. And I was putting on
[41:25] weight. And brother Charlie came up to
[41:27] me and he said, "Brother Ron," he said,
[41:29] "you're kind of putting on some weight,
[41:30] you know. You might want to might want
[41:32] to calm it down, you know. And I said,
[41:34] 'Well, I I appreciate that. And uh the
[41:38] deacon brothers, you know, I I I say
[41:40] that, you know, Cain said, "Am I my
[41:42] brother's keeper?" But a deacon, he
[41:45] says, "I am my brother's keeper." And
[41:47] we're all our brother's keeper, but
[41:48] deacons are real good at that. And I
[41:50] appreciate it. And uh brother brother
[41:54] Gary White, one time I was coming
[41:55] through the sanctu coming into the
[41:57] sanctuary, and brother Gary White says,
[41:59] "Brother Ron, you're making me look
[42:01] skinny." I thought, I'm making Gary look
[42:04] skinny.
[42:06] I gotta calm down a little bit. But I
[42:08] appreciate it, you know. And if you
[42:10] could just take the things even that you
[42:12] think maybe maybe might be a little
[42:14] negative. You might think they're a
[42:15] little negative. But I know uh even if
[42:17] Charlie if I would listen to him
[42:19] earlier, you know, because I I have some
[42:21] health problems now that are caused from
[42:23] eating too much. But uh it's always good
[42:26] to listen to uh to brothers and
[42:29] especially deacons.
[42:34] But uh I was we had the Drake family
[42:37] over years ago and brother Charlie was
[42:40] there and sister Eleanor and we had him
[42:43] over for supper and uh Brother Charlie
[42:46] was just talking to me a little bit and
[42:48] he said, "Brother Ron, you know," he
[42:49] says, "I don't feel like I've done a
[42:51] whole lot for for God, you know, for for
[42:54] the kingdom of God." And I had just read
[42:56] a message and the message said like two
[42:59] days before that how you know how
[43:00] perfect God is. And two days before that
[43:03] I read a message and brother Bram said
[43:04] if you raise your children to love God
[43:07] and to be Christians he said that's all
[43:09] that's expected of you as a father as a
[43:12] parent. And so Charlie's telling me
[43:14] this. I don't feel like I've done a
[43:15] whole lot. And I told him I said brother
[43:18] Charlie I just read a message before you
[43:20] came. And brother Bram said, "If you've
[43:22] raised your children to love God and to
[43:25] be Christians," he said, "that's all
[43:26] that's expected of you." And I said,
[43:28] "You have a son, John Drake. He has been
[43:32] uh our song our sound man for years." In
[43:36] fact, it was no coincidence. John calls
[43:38] me yesterday and he asked me some things
[43:41] because I'm going to be up here. And I
[43:43] asked him, I said, "How long you been
[43:45] doing sound, Brother John?" and he said,
[43:47] "I hate to go back that far, but he said
[43:50] 30 plus years." And I said, "What a
[43:53] blessing." You know, what a what a
[43:54] faithful brother.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; And uh so he's he had John, he had David
[43:59] that was sound and did taping. He had
[44:02] Richard at that time was in the Sunday
[44:04] school department uh teaching. And now
[44:06] he's like I said, he's Sunday school
[44:09] superintendent.
[44:10] But uh I have a couple things. Brother
[44:13] Charlie's gone to his reward. He's
[44:15] fought his good fight, the good fight of
[44:17] faith. And uh I was in the military. I
[44:21] was in the uh the Air Force actually for
[44:22] a little over four years. And it so
[44:25] amazes me because I was in how how uh
[44:30] even how how uh parallel a natural
[44:33] soldier and a and a spiritual soldier
[44:36] are because they put you in basic
[44:37] training. They break you down to where
[44:40] you're nothing. You're absolutely
[44:41] nothing. You know, you can't have your
[44:43] own thoughts, can't have your own way.
[44:45] And then the military builds you back up
[44:46] the way they want you. And God does the
[44:49] same thing. He takes us, he breaks us
[44:51] down to nothing, and then he puts his
[44:54] word back in us so that we'll honor his
[44:56] word and love his word. And it so
[44:58] parallels, you know, just being a
[45:00] soldier. And I was talking to brother
[45:03] Ken Ardal here a while back, and I don't
[45:05] want to keep the children standing very
[45:06] long, but I just had this on my heart. I
[45:08] believe it was from the Lord. But uh the
[45:12] soldier, he was in Iraq, 19 years old.
[45:16] They throw a grenade in his Humvey
[45:19] vehicle and all of a sudden he yells
[45:22] grenade and he jumps on the grenade and
[45:26] pins it to him and ends up taking the
[45:28] blunt end of the of the blast. and uh
[45:32] and the other four wounded a little bit,
[45:34] but three of them go back to Iraq and
[45:36] the other one was uh being nurtured
[45:38] back, but he could have jumped out. He
[45:41] could have jumped out of the Humvey and
[45:42] just left everybody is what they said in
[45:44] the article. But he stayed and he took
[45:47] the end of the blunt. It killed him. And
[45:50] I could think of the the message, you
[45:51] know, in the scripture that says, "No
[45:53] greater love than this, that a man lay
[45:56] down his life for his friends." And I'm
[45:59] going to pin this up if you want to read
[46:01] it back on the bulletin board. But uh
[46:04] the other thing I have is a article that
[46:07] I actually brought to my Sunday school
[46:08] class because I teach Sunday school. And
[46:11] the title is vast majority of wounded
[46:14] USGIs go back to Iraq. And I just want
[46:18] to read this one little uh story about
[46:21] this man. His name's Rick Skeus. It
[46:24] says, "Parallel scars run down First
[46:26] Sergeant Rick Sketa's calf. Tell the
[46:30] story how he nearly lost his leg when
[46:32] roadside bomb blew through the door of
[46:35] his armored Humvey. The blast shedded
[46:38] muscle, ligament, tendon, leaving Sketus
[46:41] in a days as medics and fellow soldiers
[46:44] rushed to help him. Sketus remembers
[46:46] little of that day last November, except
[46:49] someone warning him that when he woke
[46:51] up, his foot might be gone. And after
[46:54] five months and six surgeries, the foot
[46:57] remains intact, but causes Sketus
[47:00] haunting numbness and searing pain
[47:02] caused by nerve damage. Skas 36 of
[47:06] Sullivan, Illinois, fought through the
[47:08] surgeries and therapy to return in April
[47:12] to Iraq, conducting the same type of
[47:15] patrols that nearly killed him.
[47:19] But the vast majority have remained in
[47:21] Iraq or returned later, their bodies
[47:24] marked by scars and their lives plagued
[47:27] by aches and pains. I wear my scars
[47:30] proudly, said Skus as he gingerly lifted
[47:32] up his pant leg to show his railroadike
[47:35] track where doctors had made incisions
[47:38] to save his foot. Why didn't he stay
[47:41] home? He felt guilty. Because I wasn't
[47:45] sharing the same hardship uh that they
[47:47] were, Ska said shily while another
[47:50] soldier nodded at his side. For some
[47:53] soldiers in Iraq, it was a road roadside
[47:56] blast that muffled their hearing and
[47:59] peppered their body and shrapnel. Others
[48:01] have been ripped by gunfire, sometimes
[48:04] leaving them with jabbing pains in their
[48:06] limbs and compromised movement. Their
[48:09] wounds are often similar, but there are
[48:11] many reasons for remaining at war when
[48:15] their wounds are a ticket home. Some
[48:18] can't imagine any other job than being a
[48:21] soldier. Some know no other life. Others
[48:25] like Sketus feel the guilt, an
[48:27] obligation to their fellow soldiers.
[48:32] Many of the injured soldiers have begged
[48:34] their commanders to let them come back.
[48:37] One soldier was sent home after a bomb
[48:40] exploded in his face and damaged his
[48:42] eyes. He likely will never return to
[48:45] Iraq, but he still asked. Another was
[48:48] sent home because he had heart condition
[48:50] and returned to Iraq three times
[48:53] according to Lieutenant Colonel uh Cud,
[48:57] a commander of the 502 second uh
[49:00] infantry regiment.
[49:03] Uh Kunk is a doctor decides every week
[49:08] which wounded soldiers can return to
[49:10] duty. Often soldiers return research
[49:13] regulations and argue endlessly. He said
[49:16] it's heartbreaking when he has to say
[49:18] no. And I just wanted to say this
[49:21] morning that we are soldiers of God and
[49:24] that many many wounds, you know, many
[49:27] roadside blasts. You don't even know
[49:29] where they come from. That's that's hit
[49:31] a lot of soldiers. They don't even know.
[49:33] All a sudden they blast and and it takes
[49:35] them out for a while. But uh we're all
[49:38] soldiers. And I was thinking of uh when
[49:41] a soldier is wounded in battle, they
[49:44] give him the president of the United
[49:45] States gives him a purple heart and that
[49:47] purple heart indicates that he is a
[49:49] wounded soldier. And uh I just want to
[49:52] say we're all we've all been wounded one
[49:55] way or another. And brother Red, you
[49:58] know, if I was to pass out purple hearts
[50:01] being wounded in battle, I mean, I'm
[50:02] sure he would have purple hearts all
[50:04] over his chest. And I just want to say
[50:07] that uh that we love you. We thank God.
[50:10] My key, and I've told my children this,
[50:12] my Sunday school class as a Christian
[50:15] growing up, I grew up in Pentecost, came
[50:17] into the message and love the message.
[50:20] But you know, the key to a Christian
[50:22] walk is never never giving up.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; No matter what has happened, no matter
[50:27] what uh problems we've had or how many
[50:30] battles, because brother Ron has lost
[50:32] battles and I've won battles. But all in
[50:35] all, I tell my children, my wife says if
[50:37] I die tomorrow, she said the one thing
[50:39] she would remember is that I've told
[50:41] them never never quit. Never give up.
[50:45] And uh because one thing you have to
[50:47] fight for freedom and I was talking to a
[50:50] man a couple months ago, he was anti-
[50:52] Bush, anti-war, you know, anti-
[50:55] everything. He had protested everything.
[50:58] And he he told me about it. I said I
[51:00] said my father fought over in Germany
[51:03] and he was wounded and I said if they
[51:06] didn't fight over in Germany for freedom
[51:08] and I'm thinking spiritually now you
[51:10] fight for freedom and if we didn't fight
[51:13] for freedom I said we would be we might
[51:15] be speaking German or we might be
[51:17] speaking Japanese. I said those men
[51:19] fought for our freedom and the same
[51:21] thing as us. We fight for our freedom
[51:24] and I appreciate every one of you. I
[51:25] know you all have purple hearts on you.
[51:28] You've all been wounded. I look through
[51:29] the congregation and I just see him.
[51:31] I've been with you a long time myself.
[51:33] I'm sure I'd have a lot of purple
[51:34] hearts, but I thank the Lord for keeping
[51:37] us and being with us. And wonderful God.
[51:40] I appreciate my shepherd. You know,
[51:42] always been a wonderful shepherd of God.
[51:45] He uh I tell my mom I grew up with a lot
[51:47] of hierlings, but it's nice to have a
[51:49] shepherd, someone that cares for your
[51:50] soul.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; And we just appreciate Brother Ed. Maybe
[51:53] you could come up. And I didn't mean to
[51:55] be very long, but I just had something
[51:57] on my heart that I wanted to say. And we
[52:00] love each and every one of you.
[52:04] And maybe we can bring the monies up
[52:18] here to carry that.
[52:22] might open this.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[52:25] Thank you, brother Ron, for those
[52:29] fine words and especially enjoyed the
[52:33] words about brother Richard who's away
[52:36] in Siberia and the comments from his
[52:39] heritage from his father. That's really
[52:41] wonderful. Sunday school missionary
[52:43] offering. The children of Cloverdale
[52:46] Bible Way Sunday School wish to present
[52:48] their missionary offering for the year
[52:51] 2007.
[52:52] The offering is $1,020.70
[52:56] Canadian and $45 US for a combined total
[53:01] of $1,425.70.
[53:04] And this year's offering has been
[53:06] dedicated to help complete the
[53:08] translation and printing of the Sunday
[53:10] school manual started last year to guide
[53:13] the development of Sunday school Sunday
[53:16] schools for children of saints around
[53:18] the world. Brother Richard Drake,
[53:20] Cloverdale Bible Way, Sunday school
[53:22] superintendent.
[53:23] And thank you. God bless you. Thank you,
[53:26] brother Ron. Appreciate that. God bless
[53:29] you.
[53:31] Amen.
[53:33] Well, do we
[53:36] is that it? Are they going to sing
[53:38] another song? No. Thank you, children.
[53:41] God bless you. We love you.
[53:50] Amen.
[53:53] Isn't that uh
[53:56] it's just something so special and fresh
[53:58] when you see
[54:00] children? I think it's marvelous. And I
[54:04] think it would be appropriate for me to
[54:06] say just now that uh the Bible way
[54:09] Christian Academy, the school
[54:13] has uh their year-end book and I don't
[54:16] know even how many of them they make.
[54:19] They gave me one and I read through it
[54:22] all last evening. I and I was done
[54:25] studying and getting ready for shutdown
[54:28] the evening. I I picked this up. Uh
[54:32] unfortunately, if you pick it up, be
[54:34] prepared to go through it because you
[54:37] won't want to stop. That's for sure. And
[54:40] we had a just a little uh they had a a
[54:45] gathering for the uh seventh grade
[54:49] going into into junior high.
[54:52] and uh
[54:54] had a a graduation ceremony and we went
[54:59] there and then brother and sister Douly
[55:02] really appreciate them. They had a
[55:06] dinner for the teachers and uh brother
[55:09] Randy Timberman, the principal and and
[55:13] the school school board. And I uh I
[55:17] wasn't going to go because I thought my
[55:19] time was too pressed to be ready for
[55:21] this morning. But as I thought about it,
[55:25] I felt very very pressed to go. And uh I
[55:31] listened to brother Randy uh Timberman
[55:33] speak as principal to the
[55:37] uh parents and to the grads. There was
[55:42] eight or nine of them. Uh and I was very
[55:46] very impressed. I want to say to the
[55:48] congregation, I was not only impressed,
[55:50] I was moved because as brother Randy
[55:53] spoke to the grads, I found that he
[55:56] spoke
[55:58] uh far more in in far more depth than a
[56:02] principle having chosen some appropriate
[56:05] comments to children. and he began and
[56:09] he he he actually took a a direction
[56:12] that would be a a ministerial direction,
[56:16] something that a minister would take.
[56:20] And he said he was looking over the uh
[56:23] previous years and the pictures of years
[56:26] of students from previous years. And uh
[56:31] as he observed some of the pictures, he
[56:33] just said, "I don't see that one
[56:35] anymore. I don't see this one. And he
[56:39] began to feel affected by those that
[56:41] weren't there. And then he spoke to
[56:44] those that were graduating going into
[56:47] junior high school
[56:50] from a
[56:52] far more than just a principal of a
[56:54] school. But now he was taking a
[56:56] spiritual direction.
[56:58] You want to be sure and be there. You
[57:01] don't want to turn up missing. You want
[57:03] to follow through for God. And I thought
[57:06] that was marvelous. And I just said,
[57:07] "Thank God we have that kind of
[57:10] principle and these kind of teachers
[57:13] that take these young tender lives." And
[57:16] then brother Tom said made some comments
[57:18] and I thought they were so powerful
[57:20] also. He took I believe a quote where
[57:23] brother Brandham spoke about the
[57:24] children are our very heart and just
[57:28] spoke to the teachers for a moment and
[57:30] said you have our hearts and they have
[57:34] them for more hours in the day than most
[57:37] parents have their children. And I I say
[57:41] to this congregation, we want to be very
[57:44] thankful we have Holy Ghost teachers
[57:48] that can take these tender plants that
[57:51] we call our children. Yes, sure. Our our
[57:54] children, but every one of these
[57:56] children speaking and singing about a
[57:57] theophony, their theophony is the same
[58:00] size as yours.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Not one bit different. And we want to be
[58:05] conscious of that. And to think that
[58:07] their lives can be spared
[58:10] such a an enormous amount of wounds and
[58:13] hurts.
[58:14] I I'm I'm ever thankful to God and it's
[58:17] just not so little comments about the
[58:19] school, but uh also I want to we've
[58:23] discussed this and I might as well make
[58:25] the announcement now. Uh, I I'd like the
[58:29] congregation to be mindful when you're
[58:30] at the offering blocks and see what God
[58:34] is doing through the young through the
[58:37] school and our children at the school
[58:39] and just ask God if he would have you do
[58:42] something for the school on a continual
[58:45] basis from week to week. We've got some
[58:49] parents, some are single parents, some
[58:52] parents are have a difficult time
[58:55] financially. And we I do not want to see
[58:59] a single child that ought to be in the
[59:03] school that the parents would like to
[59:05] have in the school that are unable to be
[59:08] there simply because they're not able to
[59:10] pay the tuition. And I think that as a
[59:12] congregation this size, we can certainly
[59:15] certainly make that little bit up. And
[59:17] so when when you're there and you're
[59:20] placing your tithes and offerings, just
[59:22] ask God, do you want me to just do
[59:24] something a little extra? Or perhaps God
[59:27] has dropped something extra in your in
[59:29] your pocket and blessed you in a special
[59:32] way. It would be nice just to do
[59:34] something for a child. Maybe they'll
[59:36] never know where it came from, but God
[59:38] knows where it came from. Can you say
[59:40] amen? We don't take offerings uh very
[59:43] often here in the church, but I want to
[59:46] ask you to do that when you're on a
[59:48] continual basis. Just make a habit out
[59:50] of it. And uh uh we're we're going to be
[59:53] able to do something for the school. So,
[59:55] God bless you in this regard. Uh we will
[59:58] be taking offerings during the
[1:00:00] convention and already some of the
[1:00:02] ministers are beginning to arrive.
[1:00:05] Brother uh Nikolai Steanenko from
[1:00:08] Lithuania arrived with uh brother Anton
[1:00:12] and they brother Tony delivered them to
[1:00:14] the airport yesterday. They've gone up
[1:00:16] to Edmonton for the week and then they
[1:00:18] will be coming back for the beginning of
[1:00:20] the convention. I believe a a brother
[1:00:22] from Fiji arrived. There are several
[1:00:25] arriving from uh where's our brother
[1:00:28] from Fiji?
[1:00:31] Have we welcomed him? Yeah. Please
[1:00:32] stand. God bless you.
[1:00:39] Amen. And uh I think brother Steven
[1:00:42] Kemper is going to the airport or
[1:00:44] probably already has gone. They're
[1:00:46] picking up several coming from Brazil.
[1:00:49] And I think there's there's close to
[1:00:51] about 90 ministers that are coming from
[1:00:55] uh I've counted at least 22 nations that
[1:00:58] they're that's going to be represented.
[1:01:00] And I really think that's wonderful. I'm
[1:01:02] just I'm very very excited about what
[1:01:05] God wants to do. I want you to be much
[1:01:07] in prayer if you would. I hope you're
[1:01:10] not uh too weary, but I just want to uh
[1:01:14] make sure that you hold the meetings up
[1:01:16] in prayer and the the those that will be
[1:01:19] participating. We've got quite a number
[1:01:21] that are going to be preaching. I pray
[1:01:23] the Holy Spirit come down, permeate the
[1:01:27] air, the atmosphere, and just fill us.
[1:01:31] Another. How many more would like a
[1:01:33] filling? I do. Just want to be
[1:01:36] completely filled and thoroughly charged
[1:01:39] with the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. I'm in
[1:01:43] great expectation.
[1:01:45] Uh
[1:01:47] I just want to make one more uh comment
[1:01:50] and before we go to the word and and uh
[1:01:54] we've started to send out or brother
[1:01:56] John Stall has started to send out some
[1:01:58] of the videos that were made of
[1:02:01] uh brother uh brother John's not his
[1:02:04] testimony but what he had on his heart
[1:02:06] to say to the people in the colonies and
[1:02:09] whoever might receive this uh he
[1:02:12] received a phone call last night and
[1:02:15] it's from a man in a colony yet that
[1:02:19] that also was a teacher as brother John
[1:02:23] Stall was a teacher and this man said I
[1:02:27] have received the DVD and I I have
[1:02:31] listened to it. He didn't hear it all
[1:02:32] the way through, but he had listened to
[1:02:35] about half of it, the first half of it.
[1:02:38] And he said, "I am very impressed."
[1:02:42] He said, "The sermons that we read,
[1:02:45] I have the sermons that we read here, as
[1:02:48] you say, they're just mere history."
[1:02:52] And he said, "This message that you
[1:02:54] speak of," he said, must be the prelude
[1:02:57] to the rapture.
[1:02:59] Isn't that incredible?
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; That's in absolutely incredible. And uh
[1:03:05] and and he said he said it it's he
[1:03:08] speaks about where they are and the and
[1:03:10] the colony life and what they've
[1:03:12] believed. And he said it's it's it's
[1:03:14] made a 180% turn from 180 degree turn
[1:03:19] from what it supposed to be. And he's
[1:03:22] even been speaking about leaving the
[1:03:25] colony and speaking to his wife. And I,
[1:03:28] as I said, you remember I said, "Even if
[1:03:31] one, even if one, how much is one
[1:03:34] worth?" 10,000 worlds. And we spend an
[1:03:38] evening and do a little bit of video
[1:03:39] work. I say, "Glory be to God."
[1:03:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:03:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:48] Amen.
[1:03:51] So, we want to pray as these go out and
[1:03:55] are sent out. and we really uh feel led
[1:03:58] to do so. Let's stand and let's sing a
[1:04:01] chorus. Let's sing. I'm a uh I'm a new
[1:04:05] creation. I'm a brand new man. Old
[1:04:07] things have passed away. Hallelujah. Was
[1:04:10] there anything else, Brother Rod? Okay.
[1:04:14] [Music]
[1:04:22] All things are passed away.
[1:04:26] I've been born again. More again. More
[1:04:30] than a coner.
[1:04:33] That's what I am.
[1:04:36] I'm a new creation.
[1:04:40] I'm a new man. Let's sing it once again.
[1:04:44] I'm a new creation.
[1:04:47] I'm a brand new man.
[1:04:51] Old things are passed away. I was born
[1:04:55] again.
[1:05:01] That's what I am.
[1:05:12] Hallelujah.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; I just get made so happy. Look down here
[1:05:16] and see brother and sister Stany and my
[1:05:18] goodness, how wonderful. God bless them.
[1:05:22] Hallelujah.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Let's just ask the Lord's blessing on
[1:05:25] the word now and we're going to turn to
[1:05:27] it. Heavenly Father,
[1:05:30] you have made a provided way for us
[1:05:35] through your lamb, God's lamb.
[1:05:38] It is your lamb that was inspected and
[1:05:42] he was found perfect. It was your lamb
[1:05:46] that died and rose again
[1:05:49] and said, "Because I live, you shall
[1:05:52] live also." How we thank you for the
[1:05:55] life that you have given us. For the
[1:05:58] word that you have sent, for the spirit
[1:06:00] of revelation that you have poured out
[1:06:03] freely upon us. And I pray this morning,
[1:06:06] Lord, you will cause our hearts to just
[1:06:08] tingle with excitement and with
[1:06:11] expectation. We do not know what you
[1:06:13] will do here yet this morning, oh God.
[1:06:15] And throughout this day, I pray you'll
[1:06:18] bless this congregation, oh father, as
[1:06:20] we have worshiped you. And now we
[1:06:22] worship you in the hearing of your word.
[1:06:25] Anoint hearer and speaker. I pray for
[1:06:29] your glory. Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:06:33] Amen.
[1:06:35] God bless you. Would you turn in your
[1:06:37] Bibles, please, to Acts the 14th
[1:06:40] chapter.
[1:06:57] And it came to pass,
[1:07:00] this is verse one,
[1:07:02] in Iconium, that they went both
[1:07:06] together, now this is Paul and Barnabas,
[1:07:09] into the synagogue of the Jews. And so
[1:07:11] spake that a great number both of the
[1:07:13] Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
[1:07:17] And the unbelieving Jews stirred up the
[1:07:19] Gentiles, and made their minds evil
[1:07:21] affected against the brethren.
[1:07:24] Long time therefore abode they speaking
[1:07:26] boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony
[1:07:30] unto the word of his grace, and granted
[1:07:33] signs and wonders to be done by their
[1:07:34] hands. But the multitude of the city was
[1:07:37] divided, and part held with the Jews,
[1:07:40] and part held with the apostles. And
[1:07:43] when there was an assault made both of
[1:07:46] the Gentiles and also of the Jews with
[1:07:48] their rulers to use them despitefully
[1:07:52] and to stone them, they were aware of it
[1:07:55] and fled to Lististra and Derby, cities
[1:07:59] of Lyonia,
[1:08:01] and unto the region that lith round
[1:08:03] about. And there they preached the
[1:08:06] gospel. And there sat a certain man at
[1:08:09] Lististra, impotent in his feet, being a
[1:08:12] from his mother's womb, who had
[1:08:15] never walked, never had walked.
[1:08:19] The same heard Paul speak and stead who
[1:08:22] steadfastly beholding him, and
[1:08:24] perceiving that he had faith to be
[1:08:26] healed, said with a loud voice, "Stand
[1:08:29] upright on thy feet." And he leaped and
[1:08:33] walked. And when the people saw what
[1:08:35] Paul had done, they lifted up their
[1:08:38] voices, saying in the speech of the
[1:08:40] Lyonia, "The gods are come down to us in
[1:08:44] the likeness of men." And they called
[1:08:47] Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercurius,
[1:08:51] because he was the chief speaker. Then
[1:08:54] the priest of Jupiter, who was before
[1:08:57] their city, brought oxen and garlands
[1:08:59] unto the gates, and would have done
[1:09:02] sacrifice with the people, which when
[1:09:04] the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of,
[1:09:07] they rent their clothes, and ran in
[1:09:09] among the peoples, crying out, and
[1:09:11] saying, Sir, why do ye these things? We
[1:09:14] are also, we also are men of like
[1:09:17] passions with you, and preach unto you,
[1:09:20] uh, that ye should turn from these
[1:09:23] vanities unto the living God, which made
[1:09:25] heaven and earth, and the sea, and all
[1:09:27] things that that are therein, who in
[1:09:31] times past suffered all nations to walk
[1:09:34] in their own ways. Notice the 17th
[1:09:37] verse, our last verse. Nevertheless, he
[1:09:40] left not himself without witness in that
[1:09:43] he did good and gave us rain from heaven
[1:09:47] and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts
[1:09:50] with food and gladness. God bless you as
[1:09:53] you have your seats.
[1:10:00] I'd appreciate your kind attention as we
[1:10:03] approach the word. We've been a little
[1:10:05] lengthy with our preliminaries, but we
[1:10:08] just one service today and uh uh we want
[1:10:12] it to be a real blessing to you. Paul
[1:10:15] said, "Nevertheless,
[1:10:17] he left not himself
[1:10:19] without a witness." I want to speak to
[1:10:23] you, the convention is going to be the
[1:10:26] theme is witness 2007.
[1:10:30] And uh I want to speak to you today even
[1:10:32] though I had not anticipated doing so. I
[1:10:35] wanted to leave this until sometime in
[1:10:37] the convention, but I will be speaking
[1:10:40] to you Lord willing now on we are true
[1:10:44] witnesses.
[1:10:47] You are we are and this is a declaration
[1:10:51] I'm making. We are true witnesses.
[1:10:57] Paul said God has nevertheless he he
[1:11:00] left not himself without witness. God
[1:11:04] has never never left himself without a
[1:11:07] true witness in the earth.
[1:11:11] A witness.
[1:11:13] All of us are familiar with
[1:11:16] some aspect of being a witness. Probably
[1:11:19] many of you have signed a document that
[1:11:22] you are a witness to someone else's
[1:11:24] signature.
[1:11:26] And what you're saying is I I witnessed
[1:11:29] I saw this person sign this document and
[1:11:32] I'm prepared to be called on by anyone
[1:11:36] and I will be able to tell them that I I
[1:11:40] witness a signature.
[1:11:43] We understand also that a witness is
[1:11:45] someone who has either seen something
[1:11:48] happen. They have heard with their own
[1:11:52] ears or they have had personal
[1:11:57] involvement and they are personally
[1:12:00] acquainted with the event that took
[1:12:02] place that is a witness. Brother
[1:12:05] Brandham in the message at thy word
[1:12:08] he uh quoted the scripture that the
[1:12:12] trial of your faith being much more
[1:12:14] precious than that of gold which
[1:12:16] perisheth which is first Peter 1 and7.
[1:12:20] Then he said think of it
[1:12:23] might have let you get sick. In other
[1:12:25] words, God might let you get sick in
[1:12:28] order that you might be a testimony. He
[1:12:31] might let you get sick so that you can
[1:12:33] be a testimony. And a testimony is the
[1:12:36] same thing as being a witness. The same
[1:12:38] word is used in the scripture for both
[1:12:41] both of those uh for for both testimony
[1:12:44] and witness. And that he might heal you
[1:12:47] that you can stand on his word. See,
[1:12:50] that's what God wants. He'll heal you
[1:12:52] that you can stand on his word. Then
[1:12:55] when you reach the opposition and you
[1:12:57] will reach the opposition, you will be
[1:13:00] able to say, you can say, I know beyond
[1:13:04] a shadow of a doubt, you are witnesses
[1:13:08] to me in Jerusalem, Jesus said, and in
[1:13:11] Juda, Judea, Samaria. A witness is
[1:13:15] somebody who's really done something,
[1:13:18] been somewhere, and seen something.
[1:13:21] That's a witness. I've been there. I've
[1:13:24] done something. I've heard something.
[1:13:26] I've seen something. I know what it is
[1:13:29] because I was there. I was there when it
[1:13:31] happened.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; I ought to know.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Some people come with a wonderful a
[1:13:39] wonderful argument. I had people at the
[1:13:41] door of of one of the religions that
[1:13:44] like to come and knocking on your door
[1:13:46] and going to going to tell you some
[1:13:48] things. And so they were going to prove
[1:13:50] to me there was no such a thing as uh
[1:13:53] the Holy Spirit. And I said, "Well, I'm
[1:13:55] sorry. You know, you're just a little
[1:13:58] bit late.
[1:14:00] You've got a probably a very good
[1:14:02] argument, but I happen to have an
[1:14:04] experience." And I said, "Your argument
[1:14:06] is no competition for my experience. So
[1:14:09] I'm sure this is the end of the
[1:14:11] conversation." Hallelujah. It's
[1:14:13] wonderful to experience it.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So I was there. It happened to me.
[1:14:18] I've already experienced it.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful change. And our life
[1:14:23] has been rot since Jesus came in.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, a witness
[1:14:30] has to be a witness, eyewitness to know
[1:14:33] what they're speaking of. It can't be
[1:14:36] secondarily.
[1:14:38] If you go down here at the courthouse
[1:14:40] and say, "I seen a wreck on the
[1:14:43] streets." and you look at it through a
[1:14:46] window glass. You could not be a
[1:14:49] witness. Got to be right there
[1:14:52] personally. You can't double see things.
[1:14:55] You've got to be a a correct witness.
[1:14:59] One of the most important parts of of a
[1:15:02] any court case that we have, you have a
[1:15:06] court case and they call witnesses and
[1:15:09] they always allow the opposing whether
[1:15:12] it be the defense or the prosecuting
[1:15:14] attorneys. They allow them the
[1:15:16] opportunity to cross-examine the witness
[1:15:20] and say they are gifted to try and
[1:15:22] tangle you up and to ask the question
[1:15:25] from this direction and from that
[1:15:26] direction just to find out if you really
[1:15:29] know what you're talking about. And so
[1:15:32] often in the cross-examine they get the
[1:15:35] person's mind clouded and they can't
[1:15:38] remember exactly. They say, "Well, this
[1:15:40] is what you said in the hearing, but now
[1:15:43] you're saying something slightly
[1:15:44] different. you said you remembered
[1:15:45] there, but now you say you can't exactly
[1:15:47] remember. Do you really know it? And
[1:15:49] they come on strong and and get the
[1:15:51] person all flustered and then they try
[1:15:53] to destroy their evidence. And so the
[1:15:56] the crossexamination
[1:15:58] is such an important part because they
[1:16:01] try to destroy the evidence. When Satan
[1:16:04] comes to you and tries to crossexamine
[1:16:08] you about what you have experienced
[1:16:11] about what you heard, you must know
[1:16:14] where you're standing. You must be able
[1:16:17] to say, "I was there, Satan. God has
[1:16:20] already done it. I've experienced it."
[1:16:23] And furthermore, he knows very well it
[1:16:26] happened.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Something I like to rub in the in the
[1:16:29] devil's face is this. My master said you
[1:16:34] are a liar and the truth is not in you.
[1:16:38] And so I conclude you can't say anything
[1:16:40] that's truthful. If you say I don't have
[1:16:43] it for certain I have it.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; And that's a very good position to take.
[1:16:48] Put him on the stand. Say, "What do you
[1:16:51] know about this? You don't know anything
[1:16:52] about truth. You were a liar in the
[1:16:55] beginning, weren't you? My book says you
[1:16:57] were. My Lord said you were. God said
[1:17:00] you were. And God is truth. You are a
[1:17:03] liar in the beginning. You're
[1:17:05] Furthermore, you're a murderer. You're
[1:17:07] the first one to take life. God gave
[1:17:09] life. You're a murderer.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; That's absolutely the truth.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:18] We have on in these countries
[1:17:21] something that you may have heard of and
[1:17:24] I'm sure you're acquainted with, but we
[1:17:25] have in our countries what is known as a
[1:17:28] witness protection program
[1:17:32] where key witnesses of very very uh
[1:17:36] serious crimes
[1:17:38] or the mafia and some of these high drug
[1:17:43] dealers and whatever more and someone
[1:17:45] who's been on inside
[1:17:48] they have they have intimate knowledge
[1:17:51] of how this thing is operating and they
[1:17:53] know who is involved
[1:17:56] and then they say they'll well they say
[1:17:58] we have a the US Marshalss department
[1:18:01] has a a protection program in most these
[1:18:05] western countries where a witness
[1:18:07] protection program and the government
[1:18:10] goes to great lengths great lengths
[1:18:12] perhaps further than you realize to
[1:18:14] protect the witness witness because they
[1:18:17] want to encourage the witness to be able
[1:18:19] to say everything. And in there, I was
[1:18:22] actually into the documents to see what
[1:18:24] they would do for a a witness that's
[1:18:27] willing to tell all. They will create a
[1:18:31] complete new identity for that person.
[1:18:35] They will move that individual. They've
[1:18:38] said that there's hundreds and hundreds
[1:18:40] of cities that they would choose to move
[1:18:43] the individual. and give him a complete
[1:18:46] new identity. And in giving them an
[1:18:50] identity, that witness must choose to
[1:18:53] forget some of his associations and
[1:18:56] promise never never to make any contact
[1:18:59] with that association again. They even
[1:19:02] have to select who in their family that
[1:19:04] they want to be brought into the
[1:19:06] protection program. And those that are
[1:19:10] not that are not identified by the
[1:19:12] witness to come into the protection
[1:19:14] program, that witness must say and
[1:19:17] promise and vow that he'll never make
[1:19:20] contact with those even those of the
[1:19:23] family or distant family or extended
[1:19:25] family because he must and absolutely
[1:19:29] live a new life. And it's called falling
[1:19:33] off the end of the world, falling off
[1:19:35] the end of the earth. And they they they
[1:19:39] call it falling off the face of the
[1:19:41] earth was the exact words in fact and
[1:19:44] living a new life.
[1:19:46] And here I'm going to just give a little
[1:19:48] brief quote. They said that the witness
[1:19:51] security program is designed to create a
[1:19:55] total total anonymity for witnesses and
[1:19:59] help them blend into a new city where
[1:20:03] they most likely won't be recognized.
[1:20:07] The United States has thousands of
[1:20:09] cities in which to hide a protected
[1:20:12] witness. The Marshall Service is tasked
[1:20:16] with creating a new identity and finding
[1:20:19] a new city for the witness, his family,
[1:20:23] and any endangered associates. And this
[1:20:27] requires the coordination of multiple
[1:20:30] government agencies and good timing and
[1:20:35] total secrecy.
[1:20:38] They have said further just making two
[1:20:41] single quotes. Perhaps the riskiest part
[1:20:44] of the process is when the witness
[1:20:47] returns to testify. They have them so
[1:20:51] guarded and they have their heads all
[1:20:53] covered so you can only see their eyes
[1:20:56] and that's the riskiest part and they
[1:20:58] always have a group of marshals around
[1:21:01] with weapons and so on in these
[1:21:04] important testimony that these people
[1:21:06] are going to give. And then they say,
[1:21:08] "While witnesses are given a fresh start
[1:21:12] in a new community,
[1:21:14] their past transgressions
[1:21:17] are not completely ignored." And as I
[1:21:20] read that, I thought, how different the
[1:21:23] world is
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; to God's witnesses.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; God said, "And you shall be witnesses."
[1:21:30] And he didn't tell them, "We're going to
[1:21:31] hide you in another city. We're going to
[1:21:34] sneak you off. You're going to say
[1:21:36] you're going to start right in
[1:21:37] Jerusalem.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it'll spread out to
[1:21:40] Judea and out into Samaria and you'll be
[1:21:44] right out. And furthermore, your past
[1:21:46] transgressions shall be entirely
[1:21:49] forgotten.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not going to have to
[1:21:53] come back and and have some penalty for
[1:21:56] some of your past transgressions. It's
[1:21:58] certainly far different than what your
[1:22:00] government or my government suggests as
[1:22:02] a as a protection program. We haven't
[1:22:05] merely got a protection program. God
[1:22:08] gave us a new identity.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Such a new identity. Hallelujah. The
[1:22:14] world doesn't know the old man. They
[1:22:16] maybe have some past memory of but
[1:22:19] you're so different
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; as a believer. The message you're so
[1:22:24] different from the inside out, so
[1:22:26] transformed, more changed than you even
[1:22:29] realize.
[1:22:32] The last words of Jesus as he was
[1:22:35] departing into heaven, the last words
[1:22:39] that he spoke are these.
[1:22:42] But you shall receive power
[1:22:45] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:22:49] you and you shall be witnesses. We don't
[1:22:54] want to just say you shall be witnesses,
[1:22:57] but I'd like this congregation to be
[1:22:59] able to say with an a and a an
[1:23:02] affirmation within your own soul. We are
[1:23:06] witnesses.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; I'd like this congregation to say those
[1:23:09] words with me. We are witnesses. I want
[1:23:12] to add a word. We are true witnesses.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; I'll prove it to you. I'll prove it to
[1:23:19] you by the scripture. You sitting here
[1:23:22] today having heard and been birthed by
[1:23:24] the message. The message of this hour,
[1:23:26] the message that came with great great
[1:23:29] cost.
[1:23:31] This message, God is not looking upon
[1:23:33] this message as lightly. This is not
[1:23:35] just another doctrine. This is a
[1:23:38] vindicated message where God came on the
[1:23:41] scene night after night, week after
[1:23:43] week, month after month, year after year
[1:23:46] and told people the secret of their
[1:23:48] heart. I you am a are a witness of that
[1:23:52] happening.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; It happened. We've heard the voice. I've
[1:23:55] heard it.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Many people haven't heard it. You've
[1:23:58] heard it.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; You've heard the tape. You've heard it
[1:24:01] however it came to you. You have
[1:24:03] absolute evidence. I am a witness to
[1:24:06] that.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; That's the theme of my service today,
[1:24:09] friend. You might as well get on board.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; I'm a witness.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; How do you know? I heard it.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Did your priest say it? No. Did your
[1:24:18] rabbi say it? No. Did the pope say it?
[1:24:20] No. He knows nothing about this. Does
[1:24:23] the ba mayor say it? No. Does the bishop
[1:24:25] or the overseer say it? No. They've
[1:24:27] never had it.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; But I have heard it.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; I've heard it over and over again. I've
[1:24:33] heard it till it can almost become
[1:24:35] commonplace. But God help us, that'll
[1:24:37] never become common place. When you hear
[1:24:39] that, you are hearing the fulfillment of
[1:24:42] Hebrews 4 and12, the word coming and
[1:24:46] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:24:49] the heart. You have heard it
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; and you are a witness.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Satan would dearly love to discredit
[1:24:56] your testimony.
[1:24:59] Don't let your testimony die. Don't let
[1:25:01] your testimony be silent. Don't let you
[1:25:04] say, "Well, I know something, but I'm
[1:25:05] not going to say anything about it."
[1:25:07] Say, "I know something. I've been there.
[1:25:10] I've heard it. I've been birthed under
[1:25:12] this word.
[1:25:17] And you shall receive power.
[1:25:20] You shall be witnesses unto me.
[1:25:24] Something had to take place
[1:25:26] because a living Christ was among his
[1:25:28] people
[1:25:30] in the message. Who is this? Oh, I love
[1:25:34] the way the prophet put titles. Who is
[1:25:36] this? Then he came to the end of the
[1:25:39] service and started calling a woman out.
[1:25:42] Your name is Miss Belchure.
[1:25:45] Your name is something else. Who did
[1:25:47] this? He's asking the question. It's the
[1:25:50] title of the whole message. Who is this?
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; William Brandham from Jefferson,
[1:25:54] Billandanda, Indiana. Not a chance. Who
[1:25:57] is this? None other than God himself
[1:26:01] coming forward and fulfilling Hebrews 4
[1:26:04] and12. a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:26:07] intents of the heart. Hallelujah. And
[1:26:10] you're a witness to that.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; If you're just a witness and say, "Well,
[1:26:16] God sent some God sent some kind of a
[1:26:18] gift. It's just some gift we've received
[1:26:20] and it's passed by and now it's
[1:26:22] history." You're a false testimony.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; That's a false witness. This is the
[1:26:27] living word of God that never dies. That
[1:26:31] word is just alive tonight as it was
[1:26:33] back then.
[1:26:38] We've experienced it. We know what we
[1:26:40] speak of.
[1:26:42] And in this message, he said something
[1:26:43] had to take place because the living
[1:26:46] Christ was amongst the living people.
[1:26:49] The coming of the Holy Ghost. Here's a
[1:26:52] point I want to make now. The coming of
[1:26:54] the Holy Ghost in this last day.
[1:27:00] this congregation, those on the
[1:27:02] internet, those that are streaming. I
[1:27:05] want to stress that the coming of the
[1:27:06] Holy Ghost in this last day. Well, you
[1:27:08] say, "Well, he came back in Pentecost.
[1:27:11] He came back on the day of Pentecost."
[1:27:13] True. They experienced that. And they
[1:27:15] were able to go out from that place,
[1:27:18] able to go out onto the streets and live
[1:27:21] a life and travel with their ministry,
[1:27:24] whatever it was as Paul and Barnabas
[1:27:26] were doing, and give testimony that we
[1:27:30] have seen it.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; We've heard it and we're a part of it.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what God's looking for
[1:27:36] right now. This is not something This is
[1:27:40] not just a church service. This isn't
[1:27:42] just a some doctrine we believe. This is
[1:27:44] something my I've received a life.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Transforming power has taken over in my
[1:27:52] soul. I'm not the same person I used to
[1:27:55] be.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; And he said that the coming of the Holy
[1:28:00] Ghost in this last days has caused
[1:28:03] somewhat in a like manner stir amongst
[1:28:07] the people of the coming of the Holy
[1:28:10] Ghost. He said again, in this last days
[1:28:12] has sent forth a revival. The coming of
[1:28:15] the Holy Ghost in these last days has
[1:28:17] sent forth a revival. A people that's
[1:28:20] called out. Separated people. I say a
[1:28:24] people that's called out. The
[1:28:26] congregation says amen.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; A separated people. We say amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; A people that's free in their religion.
[1:28:37] And we say amen. that shouts and screams
[1:28:42] and praises God, that believes in signs
[1:28:46] and wonders. We're a free people.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Not just an emotional people. We're a
[1:28:52] free people. We have emotion because
[1:28:54] we're free.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; We're a free people.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; We're witnesses of the greatest thing
[1:29:04] that God has done since man was created.
[1:29:08] There's no record in the scripture of
[1:29:12] anything like you have witnessed that
[1:29:14] you've been born under. There's no
[1:29:16] record of it from Genesis to Revelation.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; We've been birthed under it. We're
[1:29:26] identified with it.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; And that's important. What you're
[1:29:29] identified with, your identification.
[1:29:36] you that have different passports and
[1:29:38] from different countries, you hold that.
[1:29:40] That's your ident your ID. You have to
[1:29:43] show it all the time. And more so in
[1:29:45] this day that we have in at any time and
[1:29:48] you go through the border, you can't
[1:29:50] just show a picture of yourself. They
[1:29:51] want your ID. They want to know who
[1:29:54] you're connected with and what nation
[1:29:55] you're connected with. You may be
[1:29:57] American, you may be Canadian, British,
[1:29:59] whatever, German, whatever more. But
[1:30:02] when you go across the border, even
[1:30:04] though you show who you're identified
[1:30:06] with, you perhaps don't have some great
[1:30:09] surge of of pride or some great surge of
[1:30:14] and feeling filled, you know, with
[1:30:16] ecstasy simply because you got ID. When
[1:30:20] we're identified with this message,
[1:30:22] we're not always on cloud9 and having
[1:30:25] some great glamorous thing happening.
[1:30:28] It's not that way. You're just
[1:30:30] identified with something. But when you
[1:30:31] need it, it works.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; I'm identified with this and it works.
[1:30:37] And when you become to be
[1:30:39] cross-examined, say, "Who are you
[1:30:41] identified with?" I got a passport. You
[1:30:43] can look at it as long as you want, but
[1:30:45] it'll never change. That's my picture
[1:30:48] and that's my identification. That's
[1:30:50] where I was born. And I can say the same
[1:30:53] thing spiritually. This is where I was
[1:30:55] born. This is the message I was born
[1:30:58] under. This is my citizenship.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I have a new identity.
[1:31:05] I've been given new ID papers.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; I got a passport right here.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "The same thing as it was
[1:31:24] is now."
[1:31:26] I love statements like that. The same
[1:31:29] thing that was, it is now,
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; nothing has changed. The same Holy
[1:31:34] Spirit, the same one. And we're talking
[1:31:38] about the witness. Now listen closely.
[1:31:42] The same now that was is now. The spirit
[1:31:44] of the living God lives in them. And
[1:31:47] that's why they cry out.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; You cry out.
[1:31:55] That's why they cry out.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; That's why they can't hold their peace.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; That's why you get to testifying to
[1:32:03] somebody and you just can't shut your
[1:32:06] mouth
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; because you got something that you know
[1:32:08] is real.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; You know that they need it.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; You know the world hasn't got it and you
[1:32:14] know their church can't give it to them.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; If it could, it would have. The church
[1:32:20] is after members. The church is after
[1:32:22] money. The church is after all kinds of
[1:32:24] programs. We're not interested in that.
[1:32:27] We're interested in this new life. We
[1:32:29] are a witnesses and we can say we are
[1:32:32] witnesses of these things.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; And the religious world looks on.
[1:32:43] Do they ever?
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; The religious world looks on. Listen
[1:32:48] friends, I'm not here to hype you up. I
[1:32:51] don't need to hype myself up. I'm just
[1:32:53] trying to keep my feet on the ground
[1:32:55] right now. I've been feeling I just
[1:32:57] yesterday I just said to myself, I just
[1:32:58] can't wait to get to that pullpit. Just
[1:33:01] can't wait to tell the congregation and
[1:33:04] join with them, we are witnesses of
[1:33:08] these things.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I don't care who would
[1:33:11] try to cross-examine. We can take the
[1:33:14] serpent seeds through the scripture. We
[1:33:16] can take it until they're absolutely
[1:33:18] silenced by the word of God, the godhead
[1:33:21] and the baptism. And as the prophet
[1:33:23] said, when the when the scripture says
[1:33:25] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:33:27] Christ, he said that's the way we do it.
[1:33:30] Aren't you glad you've been baptized in
[1:33:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[1:33:35] You're a witness
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; that that's the truth. And God has
[1:33:40] testified that you are a witness to it.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:46] You talk a witness protection program.
[1:33:48] How God has protected our testimony. How
[1:33:51] Satan would like to bring such division
[1:33:54] amongst the people of God. How he's
[1:33:57] protected this congregation and
[1:33:59] protected you as as families. Give
[1:34:02] praise to God.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; You know that you've come under a
[1:34:05] special protection.
[1:34:07] Satan would like to torn you to to
[1:34:10] shreds. He'd like to tore your family to
[1:34:12] shreds. He'd like to cause you divorce
[1:34:15] and all kinds of things. But God, my
[1:34:18] testimony. Hallelujah. God is our
[1:34:21] witness. The Holy Spirit has witnessed
[1:34:24] amongst us that we are his witnesses,
[1:34:26] true witnesses.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; And he wouldn't allow it to happen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wouldn't allow it to
[1:34:32] happen. Satan came in like a flood. But
[1:34:35] God raised up a standard against him.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Standard of the word of God.
[1:34:42] Hallelujah.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; How great is this God?
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; I give witness to him today. I give true
[1:34:50] testimony to him today. I'm so thankful
[1:34:53] we can be as a congregation a witness to
[1:34:57] this message.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; What an honor it is.
[1:35:06] Hallelujah.
[1:35:10] Brother Brandham said, "What's the
[1:35:11] matter with the them people? Who is
[1:35:14] this? What causes this?"
[1:35:18] Or, or may I might say, "What is this?
[1:35:22] What is this that causes that?" If you
[1:35:25] could only read the scriptures, they'd
[1:35:28] find out that it's the spirit of Christ
[1:35:31] promised by God that in the last days,
[1:35:35] I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:35:38] Hallelujah.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; And there will be a latter rain, a rain
[1:35:41] of the spirit of God falling upon the
[1:35:43] people in the last day. I give witness
[1:35:46] today that I've been the recipient of
[1:35:49] such an outpouring.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to my God.
[1:35:55] The stimulation
[1:35:57] of the revelation will do the same
[1:35:59] thing. Said in the fourth seal and the
[1:36:02] new wine when it brings revelation, then
[1:36:06] it's revealed. And that's the way it was
[1:36:09] at Pentecost, the new wine. When
[1:36:12] something was revealed, it brought a
[1:36:14] revelation. That's what happened at
[1:36:16] Pentecost. You a lot of people talk
[1:36:19] about say, "Well, we're Pentecostal."
[1:36:20] They don't have a clue what happened at
[1:36:22] Pentecost. At Pentecost, they spoke
[1:36:25] different languages. Came out on the
[1:36:27] street. How here we every man in our own
[1:36:29] tongue. In our own tongue. Are you with
[1:36:33] me?
[1:36:34] He said they knew that they were
[1:36:36] supposed to be a a supposed to be a
[1:36:39] spirit poured out upon them and they
[1:36:42] waited till this happened. And when the
[1:36:45] vindication of the revelation when the
[1:36:48] vindication of the revelation took
[1:36:51] place, then stimulation was on them.
[1:36:55] When the vindication,
[1:36:57] when the proof, when the evidence
[1:37:01] of the revelation took place, then
[1:37:05] stimulation was on them. Right out into
[1:37:08] the streets where they were afraid and
[1:37:11] had the door shut. And where they would
[1:37:14] go, the where they were out in the
[1:37:16] street, he said where they'd been afraid
[1:37:18] as a group of people preaching the
[1:37:21] gospel to them, something had happened
[1:37:24] because the true word of promise was
[1:37:26] vindicated. Now, let's stop here. Just
[1:37:31] stops. He wants the people saying this
[1:37:34] is what happened at Pentecost. The
[1:37:37] proof, the evidence that God had come
[1:37:41] and inhabited men and women was there.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; They were afraid. Now they're bold where
[1:37:49] they were hiding behind bars and locked
[1:37:52] doors. They were busting out into the
[1:37:55] streets now because something had
[1:37:57] happened to them. And he said, "Now
[1:37:59] let's stop here." He said, "If that
[1:38:02] brought such a positive to them, to them
[1:38:06] men that they nearly every one of them
[1:38:09] sealed their testimony with their blood,
[1:38:12] no matter what come along, as long as
[1:38:15] they lived, they never got over it."
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I read that. I said, "It's
[1:38:22] been 30ome years, almost 40 years since
[1:38:25] I come to the knowledge of this
[1:38:26] message." What a rest.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; What a peace. I have not go sniffing
[1:38:31] around looking for something else. Fact
[1:38:33] is when I look around I can scarcely
[1:38:36] scarcely take in what I'm seeing. I say
[1:38:39] poor people that's what they've got for
[1:38:42] religion. If it be in a newspaper or an
[1:38:45] ad or in a magazine or on a television
[1:38:48] and I see what's supposed to be religion
[1:38:51] of the poor people. I feel such a
[1:38:54] compassion for them. It seems like
[1:38:56] they're caught in some kind of a web.
[1:38:58] And here we are just in a glory cloud.
[1:39:02] Oh hallelujah. This week, last week,
[1:39:05] this month, last month, this year, last
[1:39:07] year. And Satan has been Satan tried to
[1:39:10] buff it. And God has just sent him away.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; He's been defeated. I say, young men,
[1:39:17] young women, Brother Ed has walked this
[1:39:20] road a long time, and there is no way
[1:39:23] like this glorious way. There's no word
[1:39:25] like this glorious word. I've proven it
[1:39:28] and I can tell you it's the truth.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; You surely don't mind if I get excited
[1:39:36] and enthused about that.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; It brought such a positive to those men
[1:39:49] and he says as long as they live they
[1:39:51] could never go get over it. It stayed
[1:39:54] there because it was the word of promise
[1:39:58] vindicated. It stayed there because it
[1:40:01] was the word for this hour.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; At that time, Peter could stand up and
[1:40:06] say, "This is that which was spoken of
[1:40:08] by Joel the prophet. In the last days,
[1:40:11] Seth God, I'll pour out my spirit upon
[1:40:13] all flesh, and your sons and your
[1:40:16] daughters shall prophesy." Said, "This
[1:40:18] is that."
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; And the prophet is saying, "As it was
[1:40:21] then, so is it now." We're not trying to
[1:40:24] repeat that back there. But the
[1:40:26] principle is that God came down. His
[1:40:28] word was fulfilled. And when they saw
[1:40:31] the fulfillment of the word, they saw
[1:40:33] and was vindicated that that word was
[1:40:36] now being fulfilled. A new life entered
[1:40:38] them.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; And that's what's happened.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; If you come here and say, "Well, we've
[1:40:42] just heard some new doctrines and it it
[1:40:45] seems to make sense." That's not it. It
[1:40:48] is that when you realize that God who
[1:40:50] spoke the word, God who gave the
[1:40:52] prophecy, that that prophecy now has
[1:40:55] come in line with the timeline. It's
[1:40:57] right in the season. We're in the zone.
[1:41:00] And that word just explodes with life.
[1:41:04] And when that word is in you, you have
[1:41:06] an explosion also.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going take my coat off
[1:41:14] and preach.
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:21] whereof we are all witnesses.
[1:41:24] And he says,
[1:41:26] "Now look at the promise of the last
[1:41:28] days." He said, "Let's stop here." Now
[1:41:31] he's coming. Let's look at the promise
[1:41:33] of the last days. Your promise, your
[1:41:36] time. And here we see it vindicated
[1:41:39] right before us. The present coming of
[1:41:43] the Holy Spirit. He's saying it again.
[1:41:45] the present coming of the Holy Spirit.
[1:41:48] Friends, we are witnesses
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; to the coming of the Holy Spirit, not
[1:41:54] back 2,000 years ago. Some might say,
[1:41:57] "Well, he's been here all the time. So
[1:41:59] has God been here all the time. So has
[1:42:01] Christ been here all the time. God can't
[1:42:03] go anywhere. He fills all time and
[1:42:05] space, but he can make himself known or
[1:42:08] hide himself. But he has come and made
[1:42:10] himself known. He has stepped forward in
[1:42:12] this generation. He's come out of the
[1:42:14] shadows. He's come out of the
[1:42:16] scriptures. He said, "This has been a
[1:42:18] prophecy. It's been waiting. I've been
[1:42:20] waiting on it, but the season is here
[1:42:22] and the people are here and my messenger
[1:42:24] is here." And he steps out of the
[1:42:26] shadows here and the bridegroom says,
[1:42:28] "Here I am, bride."
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Here I am. I was a mystery
[1:42:33] back there just a few years ago, but
[1:42:35] it's not a mystery anymore. I'm
[1:42:37] revealing myself
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; in the word.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; And the people saw the word. They saw
[1:42:44] the scriptures. It didn't just say, "Oh,
[1:42:46] this sounds new. This sounds different."
[1:42:49] Even though it was different and is
[1:42:51] different, but there was a life in the
[1:42:53] word. And it begin to begin to take a
[1:42:56] hold of our soul.
[1:42:59] Now, not emotional realm so much, but
[1:43:01] the soul realm. And then from that, of
[1:43:04] course, we get enthused about it.
[1:43:08] And he said the present coming of the
[1:43:10] Holy Spirit and the works that he was
[1:43:12] supposed to do. And we find it right
[1:43:15] here among us. The works that he was
[1:43:18] supposed to do.
[1:43:20] I'm identified with the message today.
[1:43:22] There's no place in the scripture that
[1:43:24] says I have to do what the prophet did.
[1:43:27] But it's true in the scripture that you
[1:43:29] need to believe what the prophet said.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; That is true. You need to be identified
[1:43:35] with what he spoke. And if you believe
[1:43:37] it, it will come into the inner region.
[1:43:41] If you're a son and daughter of God, it
[1:43:44] will transform you. This is a this is a
[1:43:46] powerhouse, friends.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; It's a life.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Whereof we are all witnesses. I'm a
[1:43:56] witness today of this vindication.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; To me, it wasn't a man with a gift. To
[1:44:02] me, it was God who stepped on the scene.
[1:44:05] Sometimes in a platform, sometimes in
[1:44:08] the tent, sometimes in a house, and
[1:44:10] maybe sometimes just being interview,
[1:44:13] but God himself vindicated this message.
[1:44:17] God proved it, and he sent the Holy
[1:44:20] Spirit. So, the Holy Spirit himself is a
[1:44:22] witness. The scripture says we have this
[1:44:25] witness within ourselves. The Holy
[1:44:27] Spirit is a witness. What does the
[1:44:29] witness say?
[1:44:31] What does that witness say? Holy Ghost,
[1:44:33] what do you say?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; I can only speak the truth.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; And when he that spirit of truth has
[1:44:39] come, he will not speak of himself. I
[1:44:42] cannot speak of myself. I can only speak
[1:44:44] of he who came. I can only speak of
[1:44:47] Christ, the anointed word. And so I can
[1:44:49] tell you that this word that the people
[1:44:51] have been waiting on, I the Holy Ghost
[1:44:53] can give witness today that that
[1:44:55] scripture has now come into fulfillment.
[1:45:00] I the Holy Ghost can say that Malachi 4
[1:45:04] has already been fulfilled.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; We don't care how many people are
[1:45:07] waiting for it. It's fulfilled.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; It's happened.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And your soul says, "I
[1:45:14] believe that with all my heart and soul.
[1:45:17] I believe that the life of that word
[1:45:19] comes into you."
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; You can't describe it any more than you
[1:45:24] can describe how your breakfast came
[1:45:25] into your system today and gives you
[1:45:27] strength. Now you can't explain that to
[1:45:29] me and I can't explain how I read a
[1:45:32] certain scripture and the life comes
[1:45:34] into me not an enthusiasm, not merely an
[1:45:37] inspiration, a life.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me friends? A life
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; filter comes in to saturate my entire
[1:45:44] being, your entire body.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:53] We're in a wonderful,
[1:45:56] wonderful witness protection program.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; We go to new cities.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Don't we, brother Tony?
[1:46:08] Don't we, brother Ernie? We go to new
[1:46:10] cities
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; where we never been before.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Can't hide it.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Can't hide this vindication.
[1:46:18] We're witnesses.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Something's happened.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Your city needs to hear it.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Your town needs to hear it.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; We have a new identity.
[1:46:30] Absolute new identity. You can't even
[1:46:34] Well, I've had I have people There's
[1:46:36] people right here. if they came up and
[1:46:39] told you the kind of people they used to
[1:46:40] be.
[1:46:43] I've had people of the world standing
[1:46:46] there and brothers who've been saved and
[1:46:49] delivered and birthed by this word try
[1:46:53] to tell them what kind of person they
[1:46:55] used to be. They say, "Ah, you never
[1:46:58] took drugs. You know nothing about
[1:46:59] that."
[1:47:01] You talk about being washed.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; You talk about being changed.
[1:47:08] We're new creatures in Christ Jesus.
[1:47:10] Indeed, in Christ Jesus is not some
[1:47:12] figment of imagination. We're new
[1:47:15] creatures in the word. That Jesus Christ
[1:47:17] is the word made flesh and he's still
[1:47:19] flesh
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; in our flesh.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; We have a new name.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; I've been given a new name. You have a
[1:47:31] new name.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; The government tries to give the people
[1:47:35] a new name.
[1:47:37] But that one might fail. But this will
[1:47:39] never fail.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; We're indeed a new creature in Christ
[1:47:42] Jesus.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; And the witnesses of Jesus Christ have
[1:47:46] their past transgressions completely
[1:47:50] ignored.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; They'll never come back to haunt you.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about some
[1:47:56] something going to come up uh you know
[1:47:59] that God is going to come and lay his
[1:48:02] finger on something and damn you for it.
[1:48:05] In fact, here's what he told you. It's
[1:48:07] forgiven.
[1:48:13] One one woman there was a sister and she
[1:48:16] was talking to my wife and God gave my
[1:48:18] wife such wisdom at that moment and this
[1:48:21] woman was relating her past
[1:48:25] and saying
[1:48:27] you know telling all the sorted details
[1:48:29] of her past
[1:48:31] and wife said to her you know God
[1:48:34] doesn't know anything about that.
[1:48:38] What do you mean God doesn't God knows
[1:48:39] everything? Well, he doesn't know things
[1:48:41] he forgot.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; He's forgotten that.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he doesn't have the
[1:48:46] ability to even remember it.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; I thought God could do all things. Well,
[1:48:51] there's something he doesn't do. He
[1:48:52] can't do because he's decreed that he
[1:48:54] can't do it.
[1:49:01] I'm not saying this to recommend it, but
[1:49:05] it's a brother here in the church and he
[1:49:08] took a very very high security position
[1:49:11] with a company that packs cash around.
[1:49:15] You know, it's like Brinks or
[1:49:19] what are some of those other companies?
[1:49:22] You know, they haul hundreds of
[1:49:24] thousands of dollars around. They need
[1:49:26] people with just impeccable backgrounds.
[1:49:30] So some months later,
[1:49:32] I got the brother and I said, "What are
[1:49:35] you doing? You know, you just deliver
[1:49:38] envelopes and, you know, stocks and
[1:49:40] things." Oh, no, no, no. He says, "You
[1:49:42] know, in an armored car." "Oh, are you?"
[1:49:46] I said, "Well, I happen to know that
[1:49:47] those people have to go through an
[1:49:49] absolute
[1:49:50] critical,
[1:49:52] exhaustive
[1:49:54] study of their past and every last
[1:49:57] thing." I didn't know anything about
[1:49:58] this brother's past, but I doubted
[1:50:00] really whether it was
[1:50:05] whether it would actually qualify for
[1:50:07] this kind of position. So, I said, "Did
[1:50:10] did you how did you do with the
[1:50:12] questionnaire?" Well, fine. He said, "If
[1:50:14] God can't remember it, I sure can't."
[1:50:19] So I said, "Well, okay.
[1:50:24] It worked."
[1:50:26] God couldn't remember it. He sure
[1:50:28] couldn't remember it. Wasn't bad. You
[1:50:31] got a good job. Held it for years. Gone
[1:50:34] on to better things.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you. I don't go and say,
[1:50:40] "Brother Ed told you to do that."
[1:50:42] That was his conviction.
[1:50:46] Now,
[1:50:48] now
[1:50:50] I just want to hear this have this
[1:50:52] courtroom because brother Brandham,
[1:50:55] Brother Brandham called the world
[1:50:58] to court and he made the whole world a
[1:51:01] courtroom
[1:51:05] in the future home. He said the first
[1:51:08] step and that's what he's talking to us
[1:51:11] about. And it seems so fundamental to
[1:51:12] us. But let us just take it through
[1:51:15] because he I've heard about
[1:51:17] justification. I've heard about
[1:51:18] sanctification. I've heard about the
[1:51:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I heard about
[1:51:21] it ever since a young child. But never
[1:51:23] heard about it the way the prophet said
[1:51:25] it. And when I received it the way he
[1:51:27] said it, then I received that. I
[1:51:29] experienced that. And we are witnesses
[1:51:32] today of the kind of justification said
[1:51:35] the first step is repentance towards
[1:51:37] God. And then follows after that is
[1:51:40] water. baptism. Repent and be baptized
[1:51:43] in the name of Jesus Christ. Water
[1:51:46] baptism follows showing that repentance
[1:51:49] was genuine or that you remit your past
[1:51:52] sins. Now he said that has nothing to do
[1:51:55] with future sin. It only it only remits.
[1:51:57] Now remember, don't just don't build a
[1:52:00] whole doctrine on that. He says it has
[1:52:02] nothing to do with future sin. It only
[1:52:04] remits. Repent and be baptized in the
[1:52:07] name of Jesus Christ. What for? for the
[1:52:10] remission taking away of past sin. And
[1:52:13] he says again has nothing to do with the
[1:52:15] future. He said you you can't repent for
[1:52:18] what Adam did. You never did it. Adam
[1:52:22] did. You just get forgiveness for what
[1:52:25] you have done. And the old nature is
[1:52:28] still there.
[1:52:30] He said, and then he goes to a board.
[1:52:32] Let me take this board. And he draws a
[1:52:34] three circles. Then he goes to
[1:52:35] sanctification. Sanctification. in the
[1:52:38] second stage of it cleanses the mind and
[1:52:41] sets the heart sets the heart the mind
[1:52:45] of the mind of the heart in order for
[1:52:47] holiness.
[1:52:49] A man can repent of sin and he's still
[1:52:52] thinking of it. Well, maybe he's an
[1:52:53] immoral man, even immoral looking women
[1:52:56] he finds and it's still there. Maybe
[1:52:58] he's a drunkard and every time he smells
[1:53:00] a drink, it's still there. But then when
[1:53:04] he gets sanctified, that cleanses the
[1:53:07] desire out of him. So now the process is
[1:53:11] moving forward. Listen. And it takes the
[1:53:14] want of it away. Under sanctification,
[1:53:18] it takes the want of it away. He said he
[1:53:22] can still be tempted, but he takes the
[1:53:25] want of it away. Still, he's not right
[1:53:28] yet. But then he's baptized with the
[1:53:30] Holy Ghost on fire, cleansed, burned
[1:53:33] out, cleaned up, and then put into
[1:53:36] service. But before
[1:53:39] before God can come down in the presence
[1:53:42] in the person rather, of the Holy Ghost,
[1:53:45] which is Christ coming down and dwell in
[1:53:48] the human heart, it first must be
[1:53:51] repented. It's going back over it. It
[1:53:54] must be baptized in water in the name of
[1:53:56] Jesus. In the name to show who it
[1:53:58] belongs to. Then secondly, it must be
[1:54:02] cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:04] And finally then and and then the holy
[1:54:08] fire and the Holy Ghost from God comes
[1:54:10] down and burns out all the desire of
[1:54:14] sin, all the nature of the world. And
[1:54:17] the Bible said it's impossible for a man
[1:54:19] that's been been born of God. He cannot
[1:54:22] sin. He does not sin. There's no way for
[1:54:25] him to sin. Listen now. He's come down
[1:54:27] to the full the full
[1:54:30] repentance, justification, and
[1:54:32] sanctification, and the baptism of Holy
[1:54:34] Spirit. He says, "How can he be a sinner
[1:54:37] and redeemed at the same time?" He's
[1:54:39] posing a question. How can he be that
[1:54:41] both at the same time? How can I be in
[1:54:44] the pawn shop and out of the pawn shop
[1:54:46] at the same time? You can't be in the
[1:54:48] pawn shop and out of the pawn shop. You
[1:54:50] can't be, you know, redeemed and still
[1:54:52] not redeemed. He says, "Oh, he redeemed
[1:54:56] us by his blood by his spirit. He
[1:54:58] cleansed us and then comes to dwell in
[1:55:01] us." The church, not the denomination,
[1:55:04] now the church. The scripture says this,
[1:55:08] "For by one offering," Paul said in
[1:55:11] Hebrews 10:14, "For by one offering he
[1:55:15] hath perfected forever
[1:55:18] them that are sanctified." And you
[1:55:20] should get that that he has perfected
[1:55:23] forever.
[1:55:25] And the scripture says, "He that is born
[1:55:27] of God cannot sin because
[1:55:30] the seed remainth in him."
[1:55:34] the seed, the word, the token remainth
[1:55:37] in him
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; and God looks on that. When you do
[1:55:43] something wrong, you transgress or you
[1:55:45] or you sin that as far as you're
[1:55:48] concerned and then you if you're a son
[1:55:50] or daughter of God, you'll repent
[1:55:52] quickly. That's what he said. You'll
[1:55:54] repent right away. Quickly. Doesn't have
[1:55:56] to go on and on and on. You just make it
[1:55:58] right. The Holy Spirit speaks to you.
[1:56:00] You make it right quickly. But if you're
[1:56:03] a son of God, that's the reaction.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; He hath perfected forever and perfected
[1:56:13] he has completed it forever them that
[1:56:15] are sanctified. And then in the 16th
[1:56:18] verse says, this is the covenant that I
[1:56:20] will make with them after those days,
[1:56:22] say the Lord. I will put my laws into
[1:56:25] their hearts and in their minds will I
[1:56:28] write them and their sins.
[1:56:32] Say it. And their sins
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; and iniquities
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; and iniquities
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; will I remember no more. Why? Because he
[1:56:45] perfected it.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; He perfected it. I didn't perfect it. He
[1:56:49] perfected. The plan is perfect. So what
[1:56:52] are we here to do? We're here as
[1:56:54] witnesses by the Holy Spirit that that
[1:56:57] word is true. Yes sir.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, but I see my
[1:57:02] failures. I see my faults." That's that
[1:57:05] doesn't happen to give a true testimony.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; It is said in the scripture. And you
[1:57:11] need to repeat what the scripture has
[1:57:13] said is truth.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. I'm not even here to
[1:57:17] try to explain it. Say, "Well, explain
[1:57:19] that to me." You have to believe it.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; God's not here to necessarily explain
[1:57:25] everything. How can we understand God's
[1:57:27] grace? Who can understand grace? Who's
[1:57:30] got the equation for grace? Einstein had
[1:57:33] the equation for atomic power, but
[1:57:35] that's nothing compared to grace.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Nothing compared to grace. Who's got the
[1:57:42] equation for grace? Who can tell us
[1:57:44] about the love of God? You can't
[1:57:47] understand the love of God. I can't
[1:57:49] understand the depths of God's love. I
[1:57:51] can't even I I can show you places where
[1:57:53] God extended himself in grace that I
[1:57:56] can't even begin to comprehend.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; How did he do that?
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody explain Tamar her life.
[1:58:05] Somebody explain Rahab. Somebody explain
[1:58:07] how those women get to be in the
[1:58:10] motherhood of Jesus Christ. How'd
[1:58:12] explain that?
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; I marvel at it.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; I'm delighted about it, but I can't
[1:58:19] understand it. I just say this is so
[1:58:21] incredible. This is so marvelous that
[1:58:24] God's great plan, he wouldn't let Satan
[1:58:27] foil it.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't let Satan thwart his plan or
[1:58:31] derail it. He had a plan.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he put such a thing into
[1:58:36] the souls of the people. And if he put
[1:58:38] it back in there, listen to me. If God
[1:58:42] could so put something within within
[1:58:44] those women and within those men that
[1:58:48] their whole being was consumed with
[1:58:52] fulfilling God's word in their hour.
[1:58:55] What about us?
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:00] Hallelujah.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not here today to try to uh I I'm
[1:59:05] not gripped with an insatiable desire to
[1:59:08] to replicate the prophet's ministry or
[1:59:10] to try to do the same things. I'm I'm
[1:59:14] here with an just an insatiable thirst
[1:59:17] to believe what has really the fullness
[1:59:20] of what has really happened. You know
[1:59:22] what I would say? I would give this
[1:59:23] congregation some advice this morning.
[1:59:26] I doubt when we step over to the other
[1:59:29] side that any of us will even have the
[1:59:32] testimony that I fully grasped.
[1:59:35] I fully understood what God did in my
[1:59:39] day.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; I doubt if we fully grasp. We may say
[1:59:44] Malachi 4:5 and 6. We may say Luke
[1:59:48] 17:30, but I can't quite decipher the
[1:59:51] whole thing. I know that it is the
[1:59:53] revealing of the son of man. But how God
[1:59:56] took a man in flesh like you and I and
[2:00:00] stood him before the people and the and
[2:00:03] the and the veil of his skin became so
[2:00:06] transparent that God just began to talk.
[2:00:10] God begin to pass through his mind and
[2:00:12] his thoughts and how he could look out
[2:00:14] over the people and say there's a pillar
[2:00:16] of fire there hanging over that person
[2:00:19] and they're from a certain city and
[2:00:21] there that to me is so amazing. I say
[2:00:24] God I'm looking at Hebrews 4 and12 the
[2:00:28] word of God is a discerner of the
[2:00:30] thoughts and I've lived in it.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; You've been gathered.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; I begin to think about the people that's
[2:00:38] going to be gathering. Brother Ernie
[2:00:40] gathering here and in the next few days
[2:00:42] and starting to gather now. Oh, I just
[2:00:44] thought of the song. Oh, what a
[2:00:46] gathering. What a gathering. What a
[2:00:48] gathering of the of the saints of God.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; You would not be here if it wasn't for
[2:00:55] the grace of God that sent a revelation,
[2:00:58] a a shaft of light
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; into your dark and confused soul and
[2:01:04] caused you to see something with such
[2:01:06] clarity, you wouldn't be here.
[2:01:09] But here you are.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Here you are. What are you?
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; You want to say, I am a witness.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; What God has done in this hour is the
[2:01:20] truth.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; And because I'm a witness to the truth,
[2:01:23] I'm a true witness.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; And that which was prophetic, that which
[2:01:29] was prophecy, God has taken me through a
[2:01:31] process. I've been justified and I've
[2:01:35] been sanctified. And now the Holy Ghost
[2:01:38] has come in. And the first the first
[2:01:40] evidence say what is the evidence? I'll
[2:01:42] speak in tongues. No, the evidence is
[2:01:44] that the word that he sent you will
[2:01:47] believe.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; And that that word now springs to life
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; and you become a different person.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; You become to live the life of Jesus
[2:01:57] Christ. It's a different life. And then
[2:02:00] the life that you live, hear me now and
[2:02:02] pray that God will give me strength. And
[2:02:04] the life that you'll live is certain
[2:02:07] scriptures that promises which were
[2:02:10] prophecies before you came but now it
[2:02:14] begins to live in you and that prophecy
[2:02:18] begins to be made history.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; We are making history.
[2:02:23] We are the fulfillment of that scripture
[2:02:26] as a when apostle Peter stood up and
[2:02:28] said the prophet spoke Joel spoke in the
[2:02:32] last days sayith I'll pour out my spirit
[2:02:35] upon all flesh and then he could say
[2:02:38] this is that
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; God revealed to him that what they were
[2:02:45] experiencing was that and that prophecy
[2:02:49] which had been prophetic now became a
[2:02:52] reality.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; You listening close?
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; There's a strange scripture.
[2:03:08] There's a strange scripture
[2:03:12] in the in the Bible
[2:03:15] and um
[2:03:20] and it says this
[2:03:25] and they sang a new song
[2:03:30] and they sang the song rather
[2:03:33] of Moses
[2:03:36] and of the lamb.
[2:03:41] They sang the song of Moses, the servant
[2:03:44] of God,
[2:03:46] and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great
[2:03:50] and marvelous are thy works,
[2:03:53] Lord God Almighty,
[2:03:56] just and true
[2:03:59] are thy ways,
[2:04:01] thou King of saints."
[2:04:06] And I've been pondering this whole week.
[2:04:10] They sang the song of Moses. I want us,
[2:04:13] what was the song of Moses?
[2:04:17] And I went back and God spoke to Moses
[2:04:21] just before he was to die.
[2:04:25] Says, "Sing the people a song.
[2:04:29] Let this song be for a testimony." And
[2:04:32] he said, "Let this song be a witness
[2:04:35] against them."
[2:04:38] And Moses began to sing a song. Give
[2:04:42] ear, all ye heavens,
[2:04:44] and I will speak and hear, O earth, the
[2:04:48] words of my mouth.
[2:04:51] My doctrine
[2:04:54] shall drop as the rain, and my speech
[2:04:57] shall distill as the dew,
[2:05:00] as the small rain upon the tender herb,
[2:05:03] and as the showers upon the grass.
[2:05:07] This is his song. And because I will
[2:05:10] publish the name of the Lord,
[2:05:13] ascribe ye greatness under our God. He
[2:05:16] is the rock.
[2:05:18] His work is perfect.
[2:05:20] For all his ways are judgment, a God of
[2:05:24] truth and without iniquity.
[2:05:27] Just and right is he.
[2:05:30] Next verse. They have have corrupted
[2:05:33] themselves.
[2:05:36] Their spot is not the spot of his
[2:05:38] children.
[2:05:40] They are a perverse and crooked
[2:05:42] generation.
[2:05:44] Do ye thus reququite the Lord, oh
[2:05:47] foolish people, and unwise?
[2:05:50] Is not thy father that hath bought thee?
[2:05:54] Hath he not made thee, and and
[2:05:56] established thee? Remember the days of
[2:05:58] old, and consider the years of many
[2:06:02] generations? Ask thy father, and he will
[2:06:04] show thee. and the elders and they will
[2:06:07] tell thee when the most high he's
[2:06:09] reminding them divided the nations to
[2:06:12] the nations their inheritance when he
[2:06:14] separated the sons of Adam and he goes
[2:06:17] on and the Lord's portion is his people
[2:06:20] he's reestablishing Jacob is the lot of
[2:06:23] his inheritance
[2:06:27] but he goes down verse 15 verse 16 verse
[2:06:30] 17 verse 18 and verse 19 verse 29, verse
[2:06:36] 30, and verse 31. All the verses he's
[2:06:41] speaking that Jessron waxed fat
[2:06:46] and he kicked and thou art waxing fat
[2:06:49] and thou art grown thick. Thou art
[2:06:52] covered with fatness. And he talked
[2:06:53] about the blessing and how the blessing
[2:06:55] came down upon his people. And then he
[2:06:59] tells them, "This is a song. Sing a song
[2:07:01] and this song will be for a witness and
[2:07:03] you'll sing this song and you have gone
[2:07:06] after other gods
[2:07:08] and the gods of the other people and the
[2:07:10] gods of the other nations and he went on
[2:07:12] and on in his song would have been a
[2:07:15] hard song to sing.
[2:07:19] When we have people sing here, I would
[2:07:23] say almost a 100% of the time, we feel
[2:07:26] better when the song is sung because we
[2:07:28] feel inspired. We feel lifted up and we
[2:07:31] feel benefited. We feel edified.
[2:07:35] And Moses had a song and told the people
[2:07:39] in his song, "You've forgotten God.
[2:07:41] You've gone after other gods. You were
[2:07:43] prospered. You prospered and and and God
[2:07:45] dropped everything on you. He gave you
[2:07:47] the country. He gave you the gave you
[2:07:49] cities. He gave you all these things and
[2:07:51] you forgot God. And you go over to the
[2:07:54] book of Revelation.
[2:07:55] I'm so glad that that the part of the
[2:07:59] scripture that's for us doesn't stop.
[2:08:03] And they sang the song of Moses.
[2:08:07] But they sang the song of Moses and of
[2:08:11] the lamb.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; It was the song of the lamb. Amen.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; We're not singing the song of Moses.
[2:08:18] We're singing the song of the lamb.
[2:08:20] We're singing a song of him that
[2:08:22] perfected us. We're singing the song of
[2:08:25] him that absolved us of our sins. We're
[2:08:28] singing a song of him that was
[2:08:29] victorious over Satan. We are witnesses
[2:08:32] that the head of the serpent has been
[2:08:34] crushed and bruised. We're singing a
[2:08:37] different song. We have a different
[2:08:39] melody
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; because we're singing the song of the
[2:08:43] lamb, not the song of Moses, which was
[2:08:46] one of a people that had gone astray,
[2:08:48] had been blessed of God. We have indeed
[2:08:50] been blessed of God. Oh, what a glorious
[2:08:53] word we've received. Oh, what a glorious
[2:08:56] thing he has done. I'm a testimony
[2:08:58] today. You're a testimony today. You're
[2:09:01] a witness today. And we're singing
[2:09:03] another song.
[2:09:06] It's the song of the lamb.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, and they said,
[2:09:12] "Come and see the lamb's wife."
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; That's my song.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; That's my song. That's your song. Let's
[2:09:20] come and see the lamb's wife.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; This is a language the world doesn't
[2:09:24] understand. They think I'm crazy, I
[2:09:27] suppose. But those that are on the
[2:09:28] internet, I hope they understand. We're
[2:09:30] singing the lamb song. Amen.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; What does the what does the line of the
[2:09:35] lamb song say? I'm your bride.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; I'm your wife.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; You have come from the realms of glory.
[2:09:45] You descended. I give testimony to
[2:09:48] Revelation 10:1 and another mighty angel
[2:09:51] descended. I know who that angel is.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; I have felt his presence.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; He has spoken to me. He has unveiled his
[2:10:00] word to me. I know who it was that was
[2:10:03] locked up in the seals. He took the
[2:10:06] seals off of himself. When he took the
[2:10:08] seals off of himself, he said, "Here I
[2:10:10] am."
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; When he took the seals off himself, I
[2:10:17] don't see one wounded and fleeing from
[2:10:20] them that are holding stones in their
[2:10:22] hand. I see one that is glorious.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; I see one that is all powerful.
[2:10:28] Hallelujah.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; I see one that has gathered a people in
[2:10:33] this generation. Listen, my dear
[2:10:35] friends, my brothers, my sister, if it
[2:10:38] was not for this word, where would you
[2:10:39] be? You would be a wreck on the side of
[2:10:42] the road of humanity.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; You'd be destroyed. Many of you wouldn't
[2:10:48] even be here in a body. You'd be six
[2:10:50] feet under. Your homes would be
[2:10:52] destroyed. Your bodies would be
[2:10:54] destroyed. be very very few of you that
[2:10:56] would be sitting here if it was not for
[2:10:59] the grace of almighty God and sending
[2:11:02] this word. You could rise and say, "I am
[2:11:05] a witness."
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 has descended.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. With an open book in his
[2:11:12] hand.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; I'm a witness. The book is open.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; I'm a witness. I know even what it says.
[2:11:23] I know what's in the book.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Say, "What's in the book?"
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll start off with a good one. My
[2:11:31] new name is in the book.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; My new life is in the book.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A life that I couldn't live
[2:11:37] before.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Your new life.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; How many of you tried and tried and
[2:11:42] tried to be victorious? You couldn't be
[2:11:44] victorious. And then one day, that same
[2:11:46] Holy Spirit came down and gave you a
[2:11:49] Holy Ghost birth.
[2:11:51] And that word exploded to new depth and
[2:11:54] meaning within you and you walked out
[2:11:56] into a whole new life.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; I can tell even recently it's true.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; I have people in this congregation I
[2:12:12] know about whose lives were up and down
[2:12:15] and in and out and couldn't even begin
[2:12:17] to live victorious. And one day, one day
[2:12:22] it was just over.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; In an instant, in a moment,
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; it was over.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; God's don't respect her persons.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; You're here today and you've not
[2:12:34] experienced that. The first thing you
[2:12:36] need to do say that is my portion.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; That is for me.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Christ the transforming power. He's
[2:12:47] still a transforming God.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Why would we want to just
[2:13:01] know live on a popper's life
[2:13:08] if we could live and have the riches
[2:13:14] that he has ordained for us?
[2:13:19] This is what God said to Moses.
[2:13:22] Now therefore, write ye this song for
[2:13:24] you and teach it to the children of
[2:13:27] Israel. It was not a song somebody got
[2:13:30] up on the platform and took a microphone
[2:13:32] and sang.
[2:13:34] Moses didn't say, "Now, you just sit all
[2:13:36] there nice and quiet and reverended
[2:13:39] and I'm going to get my ram's horn and
[2:13:43] I'm going to sing for you this song."
[2:13:45] But first, furthermore, and I sometime I
[2:13:47] think maybe you people may feel I'm
[2:13:49] overworking you, but I say repeat this.
[2:13:53] This happens to be a long song.
[2:13:56] And God said to Moses, you teach these
[2:13:59] people that song. They got to sing this
[2:14:02] song.
[2:14:05] I'd have a hard time. I'm glad that's
[2:14:07] not my song.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; And you shall go out and serve idols.
[2:14:14] I say that is strange music for me.
[2:14:19] And the gods of other nations shall you
[2:14:21] serve.
[2:14:24] That just doesn't fit, does it?
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; But I hear a different song.
[2:14:31] Hear another song
[2:14:35] with other words.
[2:14:38] You're mine.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; You're mine. Amen.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; You don't belong to anyone else.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; I like to sing a song. We sing it and
[2:14:52] justified. Justified. I don't think it I
[2:14:55] don't think it really catches us.
[2:14:59] Sing the lamb song.
[2:15:01] I took your stain.
[2:15:04] You don't have it anymore.
[2:15:07] I took it. You confessed it. and it
[2:15:11] doesn't exist anymore.
[2:15:14] In fact, as it's gone so far back into
[2:15:17] the chemistry
[2:15:19] of God's thought and God's mind that it
[2:15:22] evaporated
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; and God can't bring it back. And so a
[2:15:29] prophet could come and say,
[2:15:31] not just a nice little phrase to make
[2:15:33] you feel happy, you didn't do it in the
[2:15:36] first place. And the first place is not
[2:15:39] when you did it. The first place is when
[2:15:41] God thought of you.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; That's the first place. You never did it
[2:15:45] in the first place. In the beginning, it
[2:15:48] didn't exist. You're in the mind of God.
[2:15:51] You're not in the mind of God with sin.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; You're not in the mind of God with
[2:15:55] habits. You're not in the mind of God
[2:15:58] defeated under Satan. You're in the mind
[2:16:00] of God as a son and a daughter.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; And that's the lamb's song.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:08] That's the lamb's song.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; I say sing the song of the lamb.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:27] And I'm closing right away now. I'm
[2:16:30] trying to close
[2:16:34] in redemption in completeness.
[2:16:39] Brother Brandham refers to
[2:16:44] the Pentecost that happened back there.
[2:16:46] He calls it a shadow.
[2:16:49] And then he speaks of those that are
[2:16:51] recorded in Hebrews 11
[2:16:54] of the Hebrews.
[2:16:57] They quenched the violence of fire and
[2:16:59] escaped the edge of the sword and out of
[2:17:01] weakness were made strong and they waxed
[2:17:04] valiant in fight
[2:17:06] and turned to flight the armies of the
[2:17:08] aliens. He said all these things they
[2:17:11] did. Listen,
[2:17:14] you'd believe a vindicated messenger,
[2:17:16] wouldn't you? He said, "All these things
[2:17:19] they did.
[2:17:21] come out of the fiery furnace away from
[2:17:23] the lion's den and everything by the
[2:17:26] shadow.
[2:17:28] And then he adds a word, international
[2:17:31] word. Hallelujah.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; All this they did by the shadow.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Say hallelujah.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Can we say hallelujah?
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; They did it by the shadow.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Just in a shadow.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; In the shadow of what? Of the positive.
[2:17:49] in the shadow of what was yet to come.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; They did this in the shadow. They were
[2:17:55] valiant. They fought. They struggled.
[2:17:57] They were freed from the lion's den and
[2:17:59] all of those things.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Let me say to you, my dear precious
[2:18:04] friends, you've got you've become
[2:18:06] accustomed to the world that you live
[2:18:08] in. You'll go out and jump in your cars
[2:18:10] and jostle down through the traffic and
[2:18:13] uh and have people screeching their
[2:18:15] tires around you and you'll make your
[2:18:17] way. And some of you have flown here a
[2:18:19] long ways, brother Gary, Sister Barb, my
[2:18:24] and they've traveled and some are
[2:18:27] the kind of pressure that you live in.
[2:18:29] If you had brought some of those
[2:18:31] disciples of old, those prophets and
[2:18:34] sages and seers who you admire, some of
[2:18:37] those out of Hebrews 11, say, "I'd like
[2:18:40] to drop you and your family. like to
[2:18:43] drop you and your family into my
[2:18:45] generation.
[2:18:50] I'd like to send your children to this
[2:18:52] public school
[2:18:55] and have them under compulsion
[2:18:59] compulsory to read these kind of books
[2:19:03] and to see this cursing of God and this
[2:19:07] perversion
[2:19:08] that is being stuffed down their throats
[2:19:11] and the same-sex marriages and to teach
[2:19:15] that the children can be raised ly two
[2:19:18] men or two women and that they have to
[2:19:21] read these books. Would you like to send
[2:19:23] your children to this school? This is
[2:19:25] the school that's selected for your
[2:19:27] children. They'd say, "God, prevent me
[2:19:31] from living in such a place."
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; And they'd have to feel the weight and
[2:19:37] the darkness and the deception. And
[2:19:40] there they would live. Maybe they had a
[2:19:42] ruthless nation and a king saying, "You
[2:19:45] bow. You bend and bow or we're going to
[2:19:48] slay you." That was an easy decision.
[2:19:51] You might say sitting here today, "That
[2:19:53] was a that was a difficult decision.
[2:19:55] You've got a lot harder one. You're
[2:19:57] making one every day. You're you if
[2:20:00] you're a son and daughter of God, you're
[2:20:01] praying, "Oh, God, give me wisdom. Give
[2:20:04] me guidance. Give me supernatural
[2:20:06] leadership. It's almost impossible to
[2:20:09] see the way, but I'm trusting you to
[2:20:11] guide me unairringly.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; Is it making sense to you?
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; And if you took those heroes and said,
[2:20:21] "I'd like to drop you down into this
[2:20:24] Leodysian age where the church up there
[2:20:27] and the church over here and one over
[2:20:29] there and all kinds."
[2:20:33] I I can tell you if they were up over
[2:20:35] there in that church on 64th or down
[2:20:37] here in this church on 58th or the
[2:20:40] churches all around one over here on
[2:20:42] 184th of all these churches and they had
[2:20:45] some image up there and the people were
[2:20:48] making sacrifices and and worshiping
[2:20:50] some idol that wouldn't be a problem.
[2:20:55] When they start talking about their God
[2:20:57] like you talk about your God
[2:21:01] and they say that they love Jesus the
[2:21:03] way you love Jesus
[2:21:06] and they have certain signs and miracles
[2:21:09] and things that happen the way and they
[2:21:11] rejoice in what you rejoice and they
[2:21:13] sing the same songs you sing.
[2:21:16] Then you've got a problem.
[2:21:21] They use the same words we use. They use
[2:21:23] the same Bible I use. They rejoice in
[2:21:25] the same things I rejoice in. In fact,
[2:21:28] is they like the same spirit of my God
[2:21:30] that I like.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Now, where's the line?
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Now, where is it?
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Now, what's the difference? Where's the
[2:21:40] distinction?
[2:21:44] That's only one distinction.
[2:21:55] Well, I'm a witness
[2:21:57] that Malachi 4 is not a prophecy but a
[2:22:00] fulfillment
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; and that God has sent that man. Now
[2:22:04] you've drawn the line.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; For the first time you've drawn the line
[2:22:11] and then they're either going to say
[2:22:12] you're a false witness or you're a true
[2:22:15] witness.
[2:22:17] And then you say, "Well, that's my
[2:22:19] testimony."
[2:22:22] And I testify to Luke 17:30. In that day
[2:22:25] when the Son of Man will be revealed, I
[2:22:27] am here as a witness standing on the
[2:22:29] stand today before this congregation,
[2:22:31] before the world, having said and
[2:22:32] declare that has been fulfilled. Now
[2:22:36] you've drawn the line.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; You're either a false witness.
[2:22:44] Okay.
[2:22:49] We have something more.
[2:22:53] Let me see your people.
[2:22:56] Let me see your Let me see your
[2:22:58] children.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Let me see your young men.
[2:23:02] Let me see your young ladies. Let me see
[2:23:05] your families.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; Let me see your wife, sir. Let me come
[2:23:09] into your home and see what it is you're
[2:23:11] entertained with. Let me have a look at
[2:23:13] what you do. And I'm afraid that I would
[2:23:15] have to declare, you are a false witness
[2:23:18] of this word. You're a false witness to
[2:23:21] a holy God. You're a false witness of
[2:23:24] the scripture. And I stand here today
[2:23:27] saying that this is a true witness.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Not your argument, not how much you
[2:23:35] know, not what you've been taught in the
[2:23:37] seminary. What has it produced?
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; And it ought to be man enough.
[2:23:44] Every man in here, every woman in here
[2:23:46] ought to be man enough and woman enough.
[2:23:48] When they see that which is of the
[2:23:49] world, say that is of the world
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; and I am separated from that thing.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; I draw the line that is of the world.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; The suggestive clothing is of the world.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Your jewelry and the way it and the way
[2:24:04] you conduct yourself is of the world.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Can I just be a couple more minutes?
[2:24:12] Listen friends, I'm not quite done.
[2:24:14] Because of the way I'm speaking this
[2:24:16] morning, there was one more thing that
[2:24:18] had to happen with this prophet
[2:24:21] messenger. After he had delivered his
[2:24:23] message, he said, "I now call
[2:24:29] this generation to court."
[2:24:33] And brother Brandham took the position
[2:24:36] of prosecutor
[2:24:39] and he also took the position of
[2:24:40] defender.
[2:24:43] The Lord Jesus took the position of the
[2:24:45] prosecutor
[2:24:47] and also the defender.
[2:24:50] He said, "I don't come to condemn
[2:24:51] anyone, but the words I speak condemn
[2:24:55] you."
[2:24:58] He didn't come to condemn. He that
[2:25:00] believeth on the Son hath life. For God
[2:25:03] sent his son into the world, not to
[2:25:05] condemn the world, but that the world
[2:25:07] from for the world through him should be
[2:25:10] saved. If you believe,
[2:25:13] you are not condemned.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; He that believeth not is condemned
[2:25:18] already.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; He was both the defender and the
[2:25:22] prosecutor.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; He was the defense and the prosecuting
[2:25:28] attorney. And brother Brandham said,
[2:25:32] "I call the world. I called this
[2:25:35] generation to court
[2:25:40] and he said the prosecutor is the devil
[2:25:45] and he is he's got his witnesses Mr.
[2:25:48] unbeliever and Mr. Skeptic and Mr.
[2:25:50] impatient
[2:25:52] and they each one are coming on the
[2:25:54] stand saying the word is not true
[2:25:58] because I was prayed for and it didn't
[2:26:00] happen
[2:26:02] and all had similar testimony.
[2:26:06] My how glorious I'm identified with the
[2:26:09] message. I hope you're alert yet how
[2:26:12] glorious it was as I read those things
[2:26:14] to say I'm identified with a message.
[2:26:16] the one that's standing there as a
[2:26:18] defense to the word of God could make
[2:26:20] this word work
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; in that service in another service. So
[2:26:25] he could speak also then he said I
[2:26:28] indict
[2:26:30] this generation
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; for the second crucifixion of Jesus
[2:26:34] Christ and he said the same spirit that
[2:26:37] was on the people back there is here
[2:26:40] today against the word to crucify the
[2:26:43] word. He said, "I indict this
[2:26:45] generation." And he became the
[2:26:47] prosecutor.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, I'm not just preaching
[2:26:51] a sermon and I'm ending just in a very,
[2:26:54] very few minutes. But I want to announce
[2:26:57] to you in case it hasn't really come
[2:26:59] through when you walk out these doors.
[2:27:01] Don't forget, you're walking amongst a
[2:27:04] people that has already been indicted by
[2:27:07] the greatest ministry that God sent on
[2:27:10] the earth. It is a It is a generation
[2:27:12] that's already under indictment for the
[2:27:15] judgment of Almighty God.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; And then you wonder, why are things
[2:27:21] going to pieces? That's why they're
[2:27:23] going to pieces. Why are things the way
[2:27:26] they are? That's why they are that way.
[2:27:29] Oh, Brother Brandon talked about the
[2:27:30] economy of United States. I don't have
[2:27:32] the article right here. It was front
[2:27:33] page USA Today just a few weeks ago.
[2:27:40] They said the average American household
[2:27:43] is in debt for about $112,000
[2:27:47] personal debt.
[2:27:50] But the government, the government of
[2:27:53] the United States has every single
[2:27:55] American household indebted by $516,000.
[2:28:02] You,
[2:28:03] we are indebted. Also,
[2:28:06] Brother Ron talked about a a war in the
[2:28:08] boys in Iraq. That's a very expensive
[2:28:11] place.
[2:28:13] $516,000
[2:28:17] according to the USA Today, every
[2:28:19] American household is in debt. That's an
[2:28:22] enormous amount. And a prophet 40 years
[2:28:24] ago, saying your grandchildren
[2:28:28] 40 years from now will never be able to
[2:28:31] pay off the debt that we owe right now.
[2:28:34] That was back then because he could see
[2:28:35] the way it was going.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Say, "I got 20,000 in the bank." Well,
[2:28:42] you're only 496,000 in the hole.
[2:28:48] What's the best way out of this?
[2:28:51] Not bankruptcy.
[2:28:53] It's rapture.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; That's the best way out of it. That's
[2:28:57] the only way out of it.
[2:29:00] Leave it all behind.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; Who you leaving it to? the Antichrist.
[2:29:04] Let him pay it off. He's got it all
[2:29:06] anyway.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; You think that's a pipe dream? This is
[2:29:10] This is statistics. This is I I gave you
[2:29:12] a little bit of history today.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; But a prophet saw it way ahead of time.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for this message. Thank
[2:29:21] God for the hour that we're in. And you
[2:29:24] people are a testimony. Don't forget it
[2:29:26] before you go out here. the doors of
[2:29:28] this building today. You know that this
[2:29:31] world is under indictment, but you are
[2:29:34] the people,
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; not because I'm saying it. Tell me if if
[2:29:39] someone if someone would even dare to
[2:29:43] try to suggest that you aren't a true
[2:29:45] witness of this message, I'd say, "Well,
[2:29:48] you get me a message and a messenger
[2:29:51] that did equal or more than this prophet
[2:29:54] messenger, and I'll have reason to
[2:29:55] consider it." But until you do so, you
[2:29:58] have nothing to say. You have nothing to
[2:30:01] offer. We are in support of a word that
[2:30:04] has brought life to our being.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; Has made us whatever we are.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Thank God
[2:30:15] we're true witnesses.
[2:30:17] And I'm singing a different song.
[2:30:20] Singing the song of the lamb.
[2:30:23] Hallelujah.
[2:30:25] Hallelujah.
[2:30:32] To him all the prophets gave testimony.
[2:30:36] All the prophets gave witness.
[2:30:39] But we
[2:30:41] have been entrusted to do.
[2:30:44] I'm so I don't know. I don't have the
[2:30:47] words. I'm so beside myself to think
[2:30:50] that we've been chosen to live in this
[2:30:52] last hour.
[2:30:55] and to stand on the witness stand before
[2:31:00] this world, wherever that witness stand
[2:31:03] may be.
[2:31:08] Don't ever forget the world is looking
[2:31:11] at you very carefully.
[2:31:15] I'm not saying you're different because
[2:31:17] I'm saying you're different. You are
[2:31:20] completely a different people.
[2:31:23] you are from another world,
[2:31:26] from another place.
[2:31:28] And I could read the quote, I won't take
[2:31:30] the time. And he said, you're reflecting
[2:31:34] the world of your rebirth.
[2:31:38] Those are his words. You people here
[2:31:41] today, we are reflecting
[2:31:44] the world of our rebirth.
[2:31:48] The people that you are reflecting it
[2:31:50] to, they know nothing about that that
[2:31:54] world, but they all they ever will know
[2:31:57] about it is what they see
[2:32:00] being expressed and shining through you.
[2:32:03] That's all they'll ever know about it.
[2:32:05] And that's why you look strange.
[2:32:08] Oh, it's not your dress only. It's not
[2:32:10] your
[2:32:13] the way you are,
[2:32:16] the way you approach things.
[2:32:20] They sense it. They pick it up right
[2:32:21] away. You can meet stranger. I find it.
[2:32:24] I find it all the time. All the time.
[2:32:27] And they determine you're nice people,
[2:32:31] but it's something more than they want.
[2:32:34] They're not prepared to make that kind
[2:32:36] of a commitment.
[2:32:41] That's what the man said to our brother
[2:32:44] Frank Fletcher.
[2:32:48] You've heard the story, most of you.
[2:32:49] I'll just close with it. In his shoe
[2:32:52] store way over near the University of
[2:32:55] British Columbia, probably 30 miles from
[2:32:57] here
[2:32:59] on 4th Street, I believe it was 4th
[2:33:01] Avenue, 4th Street,
[2:33:03] over near the university.
[2:33:06] the man who was designing this church
[2:33:08] that you're sitting in,
[2:33:10] the architect that was designing this
[2:33:12] church, we told him what what money we
[2:33:15] had and he had to work within that. and
[2:33:17] he'd be designing a grand building with
[2:33:20] some enormous kind of a ceiling and roof
[2:33:23] and oh my he just was so elaborate
[2:33:29] and he sent me down to Portland to look
[2:33:31] at a similar roof and the roof was going
[2:33:33] to cost what we wanted to pay for the
[2:33:34] whole building
[2:33:37] something like the BC center with one of
[2:33:39] those polyurethane roofs blowed up with
[2:33:41] air on the inside and uh we have enough
[2:33:44] air on the inside anyway.
[2:33:49] And so we fired him.
[2:33:52] The board fired him. Said we, you know,
[2:33:54] we got to get another. And he was in
[2:33:57] brother Frank Fletcher store buying a
[2:33:59] pair of shoes.
[2:34:04] And Frank asked him a question. He says,
[2:34:06] "Where's there a church that preaches
[2:34:09] the truth? Is that what you said?
[2:34:12] Can you say it out loud?
[2:34:20] Stand up and say it again. You gota you
[2:34:22] got to yell at brother Frank
[2:34:29] as church
[2:34:32] to live
[2:34:37] it. It was too heavy for me, but it
[2:34:40] might be for you. So I asked him what it
[2:34:43] was.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; And that's it. It's too heavy for him,
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; but it might be all right for you.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; And here he came. It was too heavy for
[2:34:54] one, but it was just right for another
[2:34:55] one.
[2:35:03] Amen. Let's stand to our feet. I can say
[2:35:06] it was just right for me.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless the Lord.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't mind. I'm going to sing
[2:35:16] a couple happy songs.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; I was there when Jesus saved me.
[2:35:22] I I was there and I guess I ought to
[2:35:24] know. Were you there?
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; Better be a witness.
[2:35:32] [Music]
[2:35:36] I was there when Jesus saved me.
[2:35:40] [Music]
[2:35:43] He took away my heavy burden and he gave
[2:35:47] me peace.
[2:35:49] [Music]
[2:35:52] [Applause]
[2:35:53] [Music]
[2:36:00] [Music]

[2:36:20] [Music]
[2:36:30] And I guess I ought to know.
[2:36:33] [Music]
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; Well, that wasn't bad,
[2:36:38] but it wasn't really, you know, we're
[2:36:40] not there yet.
[2:36:43] like the children soon as they said, "I
[2:36:46] think you can do better." Oh, it just
[2:36:47] went right up. Maybe this is new to a
[2:36:50] lot of you, but I think we can sing it
[2:36:51] anyway.
[2:36:53] I was there when Jesus saved me.
[2:37:00] He
[2:37:02] broke
[2:37:04] me
[2:37:09] down.
[2:37:12] [Music]
[2:37:17] [Applause]
[2:37:23] Brother Rod, do you know the verses to
[2:37:24] this? I'm sure you do. Help us out. You

[2:37:51] whether all is well.
[2:37:55] [Music]
[2:38:02] But I was there when it happened. And I
[2:38:05] guess I ought to know
[2:38:10] I was there to save me.
[2:38:14] Microphone.

[2:40:35] Oh, there they'll be
[2:40:38] in their blessing.

[2:41:13] and I will sing
[2:41:16] with redeemed.
[2:41:20] [Music]
[2:41:21] You know, it's a song that I sing quite
[2:41:23] often when we've been out in conventions
[2:41:26] and I get carried away and because a lot
[2:41:27] of folks don't know me there, I I kind
[2:41:29] of do things I never done before, but I
[2:41:31] always I I like to wave my handkerchief.

[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; I didn't understand it, but it sounded
[2:44:14] good.
[2:44:16] Give us a word of greeting.
[2:44:22] I'm very happy to be here for the first
[2:44:24] time.
[2:44:26] I got here at the very good moment
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; and the moment of the breaking of the
[2:44:32] bread.
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; It's a special moment.
[2:44:38] It was a desire in our heart
[2:44:42] to get to know this church
[2:44:44] and the saints in Christ
[2:44:47] that were reached through this message.
[2:44:50] I am certain
[2:44:53] that it was because you got to know this
[2:44:55] message
[2:44:56] that we are here on this mo right
[2:44:58] moment.
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; This message
[2:45:02] of the evening time
[2:45:04] that united our hearts
[2:45:08] and when we see for the first time
[2:45:11] then we know each other as brothers.
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; True brothers
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; regardless of color.
[2:45:20] nationality or race.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; We are brothers.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; And when I got here,
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; I could see this wonderful church
[2:45:35] enjoying of the presence of God.
[2:45:40] And we were moved. We came from Brazil
[2:45:43] just to be here. And we believe that
[2:45:45] Jesus is here tonight.
[2:45:47] and we want to worship him on this stage
[2:45:50] with you as well.
[2:45:54] I was hearing the brother preaching a
[2:45:56] while ago
[2:45:58] when he said that
[2:46:02] we are rich
[2:46:05] &gt;&gt; and sometimes we we live like poor.
[2:46:09] &gt;&gt; That's one of the worst situations we
[2:46:10] could be in is when we are rich
[2:46:14] and we know not.
[2:46:16] But this message,
[2:46:19] it came and took it away from us, this
[2:46:22] kind of thought to bring us
[2:46:25] to get to know this true richness
[2:46:29] to be sons and daughters of God.
[2:46:33] He was the message of William Brandham,
[2:46:36] the the messenger of the
[2:46:40] brought this truth for us.
[2:46:43] I didn't know I was a son of God.
[2:46:45] I was living like a miserable person
[2:46:49] eating any kind of food.
[2:46:51] Today I have the best food for my soul.
[2:46:54] I have the message of the hour.
[2:46:57] So now I know that I am rich
[2:47:00] and I don't want to live like a poor
[2:47:02] person. I want to live like a rich
[2:47:04] person and the message of the hour.
[2:47:09] I want to thank you with all my heart.
[2:47:14] I want to thank brother Bisco
[2:47:17] for his invitation for me to come to
[2:47:19] Canada
[2:47:22] since I saw his name on the books the
[2:47:24] messages.
[2:47:26] &gt;&gt; So I I I I was interested in knowing
[2:47:31] because I know you know the message
[2:47:34] more than we do.
[2:47:38] Not all the names that brother Brandham
[2:47:40] mentioned
[2:47:43] that these men have kept in the center
[2:47:45] of the way.
[2:47:48] We know him
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; and his ministry
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; and his work.
[2:47:56] I I I believe his name is not on the
[2:47:58] books by chance. That was a purpose of
[2:48:01] God for this man. So we desire to come
[2:48:04] here and see
[2:48:07] so that we would have the blessings as
[2:48:08] well
[2:48:10] and I hope that during all this week
[2:48:13] and the next week
[2:48:16] we are bringing good things back home
[2:48:20] as the proverb goes
[2:48:23] when we go to the supermarket
[2:48:26] and we have money to buy
[2:48:29] we always take a cart
[2:48:32] and when we come to church
[2:48:35] and we have faith to receive.
[2:48:38] We need space to bring all the blessings
[2:48:40] back home
[2:48:42] and I believe that God will give us
[2:48:43] those blessings.
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; You came with me. Brother Neville, my
[2:48:48] son,
[2:48:50] my wife as well, sister,
[2:48:53] she's on the way back there.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; May God bless you all.
[2:48:58] &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord Jesus.
[2:49:05] come and give us a greeting.
[2:49:07] God bless you.
[2:49:11] &gt;&gt; It's a great pleasure
[2:49:14] to be here this morning
[2:49:17] to see uh so many lovely faces,
[2:49:21] people a very all kinds of different
[2:49:24] people.
[2:49:27] So I started thinking how wonderful will
[2:49:29] that day be.
[2:49:31] Amen.
[2:49:36] &gt;&gt; So, it's been a great priv privilege to
[2:49:38] uh get to know the ministry of your
[2:49:39] pastor.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; I met him December last year
[2:49:46] on his trip to John Pesa.
[2:49:51] So, it was a great privilege hearing him
[2:49:53] preaching.
[2:49:56] So I extended him an invitation as well
[2:49:59] to come and preach on my congregation.
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; So then he said if you go to if you come
[2:50:03] to my place
[2:50:05] &gt;&gt; then I will make you a human promise.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; I'm here.
[2:50:12] Hallelujah.
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; The church on which I am minister it's
[2:50:19] called El Shadai Tabernacle El Shadai.
[2:50:23] &gt;&gt; It's uh way down in Brazil in the south.
[2:50:26] And we have a website
[2:50:30] and uh the messages that he preached on
[2:50:33] that occasion I put them in there
[2:50:37] and many people were blessed through
[2:50:38] that
[2:50:40] but they were not on the meetings but
[2:50:42] they they had the chance to watch
[2:50:46] and many people asked for copies as
[2:50:48] well. They were blessed too.
[2:50:54] It's wonderful to see him preaching
[2:50:55] about the ministry of the son of man,
[2:50:59] about the opening of the seven seals.
[2:51:02] I loved it very much.
[2:51:05] When I saw him preaching about the
[2:51:06] rapture,
[2:51:08] this message is the rapture.
[2:51:11] It we are on this rapture.
[2:51:14] This message is bringing this up, the
[2:51:17] faith for the rapture.
[2:51:22] and we are looking forward to have a
[2:51:24] very blessed week.
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; Just a little foretaste.

[2:52:37] their ministry amongst us

[2:52:43] uh time with them and may it be just a
[2:52:46] mutual benefiting of the body of Jesus
[2:52:49] Christ. Lord, I pray that you will take
[2:52:51] the people now and send them from this
[2:52:54] place with the glory of God upon them.
[2:52:58] And may they know of a certainty that
[2:53:01] they have been elected, chosen, and
[2:53:03] called of the Almighty God to be
[2:53:06] witnesses of this truth and of this
[2:53:09] message that you have sent. Lord, I pray
[2:53:11] that you'll give them such a boldness
[2:53:13] and such a strength. I ask Father now
[2:53:17] that the word may linger along with us,
[2:53:20] nor your presence will ever go with us.
[2:53:22] In the name of Jesus Christ, I commit
[2:53:25] them to you. Amen. Amen.
