And I have a prayer request here from Sister Lorie Snow to pray for her dad who is undergoing surgery uh tomorrow for his eye. And she's just asking us to remember him and that the Lord would guide the surgeon's hand and all would be well. Amen. Bless you, brother John. just hold our needs up before the Lord together as believers. Lord, what a privilege to be able to come into your house. &gt;&gt; We want to say thank you, Lord, for providing this opportunity for us &gt;&gt; that in the midst of gross darkness, famine in the land, &gt;&gt; disaster all around, that you've brought us to your side and called us into your tent, Lord. Oh father, we come into the tent of this sanctuary and want to lay aside everything of our lives that's would be distracting or of this world or in our own lives. We just want to lay it aside right now. May the cleansing touch of Jesus and that blood that we've just sang about come down and touch each life. Lord, we believe and there's power in that blood is able to come into every heart and make the vilest sinner whole. Lord, it's limitless, Lord, what you're able to do in a heart that believes all things are possible. So Lord, as believers, we've come, Lord, wanting to shake off the world and come into this atmosphere of your divine presence, just wanting divine love to soak down into our innermost being. Oh, Father, Lord, what you can do in just a few minutes, just five minutes in your presence, just a word from you, Lord, can turn a life change a situation. We're looking for direction. We're looking for leadership. We're asking for your provision for every life. As the families gathered around the table, we have confidence in you, Lord. Just hearing your prophet this morning speak about the great wall and how there's gifts in the body that you've placed to look up over that wall. We came, Lord, myself, our families, all of us. Lord, we have confidence in the gifts of God. The prophet that looked up over the wall and saw way down to your coming that we would have meat and food in due season even for July 2014. There's power in the word. There's enough power in your word to give us a new body. Place us into the rapture, Lord, for our children, for our unsaved loved ones, for any sick that might be here. Sister Lorie's father has need of a great physician for his eye. Would you be present, Lord God? There's unspoken request here, Lord. We have confidence in you that you have brought us up over the fence to look into this evil age that there would be light at the end time. We believe our prophet was one of those gifts. We believe our pastor is one of those gifts. And as you use his gift, Lord, this morning to move us up over the wall of circumstance, up over the wall of unbelief, that we as eagles, Lord, will be able to dig down deep into the word. Hallelujah. Lord, we love your appearing. Don't just talk between the lines, Lord. There's needs among us. Take all the fog away, Lord. Any scales, Lord. This is our one service, Lord. We want to dig deep in the spirit of revelation. We don't want the world, Lord, to come in and blindside us. We believe, Lord, these gifts can look up over and see down the road. You can use these ministries. Our brother Tim Dodd, our brother Tom Ray, our brother Murphy, you used him. These gifts are in the body. We thank you for them, Lord, for they're given as the dress wear to clothe our nakedness that we be able to come into your presence and know that our sins are under the blood. We can have divine relationship with Jesus Christ. So take everything under your divine control today. In all of our lives, we bring subject and we fall down on our knees as worshippers. Bless this offering. Lord, multiply it, God. Some aren't able to give, but I know their hearts would be wanting to give. May you bless their lives and give those that do give, Lord, an extra blessing today. We are in your house, Lord. We are your family and we love your appearing and we love every time Lord that we can sing songs and lift up these hands and say amen to the word. Go out on the internet Lord and just may there be a great movement in your bride today Lord of faith and of believing all things are possible Lord. We love you Jesus. We thank you for what you're going to do today. We believe today, Lord, chains are going to be broken, God, and hearts are going to be set free. We're going to go home saying, "Our hearts we're burning within us today as we heard you step out of the shadows. And you spoke to me and my heart is full. My cup is overflowing, God. For you are the greatest thing in all of our lives, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Lord, &gt;&gt; thank you for answering the prayers of your people. We give you this day, this morning service in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] I am redeemed. I'm bought with a price. Jesus, have your seat, please. Oh, [Music] if anybody ask you just who I am, oh tell them I am first one where there was a love now abounds. Where there was confusion, peace now. I'm walking with Jesus. I'm a child of the King. It's all because that I am redeemed. [Music] Oh, I am redeemed. [Music] Jesus has changed. [Music] I am telling that I am redeemed. I'll tell him his favor. I'll tell his favor. Tell of his precious blood. I'll tell his goodness to me. He purchase my creation with his precious blood and pro [Music] Jesus has changed my life. [Music] I am [Music] I [Music] am if anybody asked you if I ask you who I I am redeemed. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's worthy of our praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Couple of announcements. Um there's a prayer meeting this Friday and also on the 25th. So, this is the 11th and then two weeks is the 25th. And brother Tom also has an announcement and I'm just going to call him up this time. &gt;&gt; Well, this is a camp announcement, but it's a a pre-amp announcement. Um, I don't know how many of you have been aware, but we are going to have uh a group from China coming to join us at camp. And the number right now is 24. So, um there's brothers that go out on the mission field. Now you can be the mission field. And uh we're just making a preliminary announcement because uh we're needing to billet them for uh they're coming in on the um 18th of July and we'll be leaving on the 8th of August. But in between that we have camp of course and we're going to be putting them up at camp for the whole week. And so it's just going to our camp this year. I don't know what is going on, but it's the largest camp we've ever had in all of our history of camps. And they're coming from the east and the west and north and the south. But we have a large contingent coming from China. And um which is going to be a challenge because right now they have their American visas, but they don't have the Canadian ones. So Lord willing this week we'll find out whether they get their Canadian ones. So as of right now we have 24 coming into Seattle. We'll need to move them from Seattle to homes. And the challenge then, of course, is communication. And of course, Roy, you can speak Chinese. I know that. But Sister Mary is here and Jason's here and different ones can speak Chinese. So, we will be building them with one that can uh translate English Chinese. So, if uh your home is available on both sides, whether it be Canadian, because there should be some that will be getting some Canadian visas on this side. And I know the um brother uh Ozales has opened his home already. Different ones have mentioned that they will take four or five, whatever. Brother Glenn, of course, we'll be taking some. So, no problem there. Um so, there's two ways we can do this. You can volunteer or we will volunteer you. No, I'm just we're just looking forward to having a wonderful time. They've come because of the effect of our young people over in China, their confidence in Brother Murphy and what God has done through his ministry. They have come to see you. They've come to be a part of our camp. And we want to open our uh our doors of compassion. We want to be able to give them a wonderful time around the word of God and in our homes. &gt;&gt; So, if you wouldn't mind getting a hold of Sister Megan Drake at the office this week and um what what you can absorb in your home, that would be great. and then we will work it out over the next couple of weeks. God bless you, brother Clarence. Sister Audrey, nice to have you back. We've missed you. God bless you. Well, you're gone a month. &gt;&gt; Six weeks. It see it seemed like six months, but it's nice to have you back. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing uh a chorus together and Sister Joanne will have a special for us. Um, all hail King Jesus. All hail King Jesus. [Applause] [Music] bright and throughout eternity I want to praise him and forever more I will reign with him. Let's sing out once more. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] I [Music] want to praise you and forever I will reign with him. Amen. [Music] I just came into his presence and my feet are standing on the hallowed ground. Seems I'm close enough to touch him and my heart can hear him speak without a sound. [Music] Something whispers stand beside me. Let my glory fill the temple through and through. I just came into his presence in the holy place with Jesus. Hallelu. [Music] Hallelu. Hallelujah. I just came into his presence. Hallelu. Hallelu. Hallelu. I just came into his presence. Hallelujah.

It's so nice to see you all this morning and greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We want to also give special greetings to all those from the US side. Uh you're you're celebrating your independence day and July the 4th and so we congratulate you for that. Uh, God bless our brother and sister Dodds, brother Edwin, Sister Sally. How we appreciate them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love them so faithful. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Edwin is a veteran from the US Air Force and and uh has certainly served a notable service to that country. And we also as Canadians we must say we appreciate America. Uh they've been a great protector for us as well. Have done very much. And uh so we we thank God for every person. Nice to see our brother and sister Gerard here from Tucson. God bless you. I did see you in the in the hallway. And then uh I see that brotherh brother brother Clarence and sister Audrey are back and have been welcomed. And uh we're all back. We're all here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some away today on the on this vacation time, but we're glad you're not all on vacation or I wouldn't have anybody to preach to. But you're here. God bless you. Thank you. Let's just ask the Lord to bless the word a moment. Dear heavenly father, we stand amazed in the presence of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not only the Nazarene, but one that was loved and hated both. One that gave himself a sacrifice for us. We want to speak about that. Oh God, I pray that you will make this message more than a sermon. &gt;&gt; Make it something, Father, that'll be a milestone in the people's hearts. I pray &gt;&gt; we have not many days perhaps. We have not much time, oh God. &gt;&gt; We want to have the greatest effect we can upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless your people, I pray, and their witness, oh God. Let the Holy Spirit reverberate through every life &gt;&gt; that is not only here, but those that are away, those that are streaming the service. We've heard from some even in the last few days how they are blessed by streaming and being part of the congregation. And we say, Father, bless them. Send your blessings their way. regardless of what country they may be in or what condition they may be in. I pray that you will send your healing power to everyone that is sick and deliverance to those that are bound. &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll loose the people, oh God, and let a spirit of divine revelation &gt;&gt; come upon each one, Father, that we might see where we're at &gt;&gt; and the season of our time that we're in. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, your blessings now we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to have you just have your seats for a few moments. There's only one service today and we're not going to try to abuse that. But I did want to say that uh I know that brother Tim Dodd had had uh held this message this book rather not message book but it's uh it's the revelation of Jesus Christ series. the entire series done in one book. It's done by Yola's father. Uh and uh we're h certainly happy to have Sister Yola here who has come. Would you stand Yola? So uh those there she is. That's brother Jacques's daughter. and uh brother Jacques he's they live in Czech Republic uh but have uh he's he he translates into the Polish language and I should say not just a translator he's a perfectionist in the language and this is uh I believe 296 pages no I'm sorry 496 pages and they had it printed in uh in in Poland for $166 per book and I thought that was remarkable. &gt;&gt; That's absolutely remarkable. So, we have committed ourselves to $2,000 to pay for the first 1,200 of these that he's ordered. He just ordered 1,200 because he felt that was all that he could handle. So, we said that we I I committed myself while I was in in Switzerland that we would like to do that. That's a really a masterful piece of work and we really appreciate he's he's translated for about 30 years and if you you should just try translating one one message once you find out it's a it's a real task. So we we praise God for brother Jacques's work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I would like to say with regards to the service today, uh, I was sitting on the platform while brother Murphy was preaching and I already had a a phrase. Sometimes the Holy Spirit will just speak a phrase and how do you know it's the Holy Spirit? Well, the Holy Spirit won't let go. It just keep saying the same thing and just keep repeating the same thing. That's how you always know if it's if it's God or is it just your own mind or something. You'll just feel a a a nudge. You'll just feel uh a voice, inner voice. It'll just keep saying the same thing. Always the same thing. And uh it's not guilt and it's not condemnation. It's not it's not anything of that nature, but it it might be something you don't understand. And the phrase was uh the end thereof. The end thereof. And I thought, yeah, what about the end thereof? I know we're in the end time and the end thereof. And uh so I was thinking about that and just pondering it and I was listening to brother Murphy preach and a a strange scripture came to me. And uh it was as Jesus was coming to the end of his life here on earth. And uh and the Bible is telling us that the the the women and people were going along and he had been condemned. and and they went along and were weeping and lamenting over him. And then Jesus turned and said, "Uh, don't weep for me, but weep for yourself and for your children, for the days will come." So, right away, it it connected, and I didn't even recognize it connecting right at that moment. I was connecting with the end time for the days will come uh when they will say blessed are the womb that has not did not bear and the paps that did not give suck and I thought that was a strange statement. So the message is really uh having to do with that scripture, but it's not a sermon. That's not I'm not preaching a sermon. It's more of a more of a study. And we have quite a bit of reading because then I was directed into brother Brandham's message, the present stage of my ministry. &gt;&gt; And uh as a prophet, things are prophetic. and and it's just amazing how he he continued on a very precise uh course through that message and and not only speaking of the season that he was in but what it would come to. And so I wanted to see if he had said anything about Jesus when he said if this was done in a green tree. He said to the women, "Don't lament over me and weep over me. For if this was done for if they do this in a green tree, what will they do in a dry?" And right away I I while Brother Murphy's preaching, I'm thinking green tree, but he was the tree of life. and then uh a tree of life. And I thought, I wonder if Brother Brandham ever referred to that refers to it once and I'm going to go into it with you. It just incredible. It would take a prophetic eye &gt;&gt; to go where he went in the scriptures. And so, um, with that, I will, uh, I will have you stand and we'll read a scripture. It's uh found in Luke the 23rd chapter. And while you're standing and while we're getting ready to turn, uh or while you're turning, uh my comments this morning and what we will go into is not it not personal or or of any other person. This is not reference to myself personally or anyone else personal. Uh but the person of Jesus Christ uh everyone that has Jesus Christ dwelling in them will experience the same things, &gt;&gt; the same characteristics that we speak of this morning. And the message this morning is in reference to the revelation of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ the person in this hour. Now, brother Brandham's ministry, I mean, I want to lodge this as a almost like a for statement. His ministry was a dispensational ministry. That is why it becomes the target of all of intense love. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Uh love that is so great that it is misunderstood. So they it's it's commonly said, well, they make him deity. Uh oh, I'll just stop there. Jesus said, I is he deity? &gt;&gt; Will be in you. &gt;&gt; What does that do? Well, depends on how much you want to water that down. &gt;&gt; If you want to water it down or if it means what it says. &gt;&gt; And I prefer to say it means what it says. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't make us gods, of course, but it may make us messiahs &gt;&gt; because deity will be in you if you allow and yield to that. &gt;&gt; And uh and then uh now I want to also just make reference to life here. Life here in this place that we have has essential requirements that is placed on all of us. We have to have a home place where we live, family, friends or someone close. We need those relationships. We need pure religion or religion. People need religion. So all over the earth they worship somehow some way. &gt;&gt; They bow and do obesence to something. We have economics and we've got to earn and we have to pay our bills. We all have to do that. We need some RNR. We need to have time to relax to gather ourselves together to rest or and the world has the whole world of entertainment and the whole world of sports and the whole world of something to catch themselves up. People have to have that as well. We have to have our education uh regardless of how little or how much of it. But we need education and we need uh we have concerns concerning health health issues. Uh as you get older you think about you know how am I going to manage when I can't work don't have to say retirement as such but you know how how is that going to happen? What's going to happen if you know we fall sick or something like that. So we have those things but then I want to stop there and say all of these essential areas have been permeated. Are you listening? Have been permeated by Satan. Right. &gt;&gt; He's invaded every single one of those to such a degree and homogen homogenized himself with them until it's almost impossible to separate what is essential, what God recognizes as being essential to life and what Satan has to attract to distract us from the truth and to attract us to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. So with that we'll just read. &gt;&gt; And there followed him a great company of people. I'm sorry this is starting with verse 27. And there followed him a great company of people and of women all which also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning unto them said,"Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, "Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bear, and the paps which never gave suck." Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, "Fall on us," and to the hills, "Cover us." For if they do the these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? The prophet Jeremiah has said, you can just listen as I read this one verse. The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means, and my people love it to have it so. And what will you do in the end thereof? And that's where I came up to the title, what will you do in the end thereof? You may be seated. It'll be very necessary for you to keep your thinking caps on and to follow very closely because this service is one that I intend to hold to my notes as close as I can and and uh I have a lot that I will read with you as well. In the true Easter seal, brother Bram said, "He also broke another seal that I want to speak of here found over in Exodus. When man had sinned and separated himself from the presence of God, and he came to worship God, there was a veil that hung between the holy and the holiest of holies. Inside the holiest of holies was the shikina glory. They were not permitted to go in there. They were not permitted even to look of look of it. And a man going in there had to be anointed once a year, dressed right, blood on him, blood in his in his hand, blood in the charger to sprinkle the mercy seat. But oh brother, when it was sprinkled that day with the blood of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the spirit of God rent the seal from the top to the bottom and brought man back. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If they do this in a green tree, that's the only place I found this in the message. If they do this in a green tree, what will they do in a dry? And if they did that to him being the green tree of life, what will it be done to the old dead formal tree that has no life? Now, when the wrath of God, now we're coming to the end because Jesus is just coming to when the full extent of God's wrath that will be poured out upon him. And when the wrath of God is poured out, how can the old dead formal tree stand it? When the green tree, it even perished. The green tree and sent it to hell. I was thinking of the tree of life. Listen friends, the tree of life &gt;&gt; went to hell for you and I &gt;&gt; because that was our penalty. &gt;&gt; And if it didn't, then it didn't. He didn't take the full penalty. Amen. &gt;&gt; He took the full penalty and sent it to hell. The wrath of God poured out for disobedience of sin sent the green tree to hell. What will it do in a dry tree when it strikes it? If the righteous will be scarcely saved, where will the sinner and ungodly appear? That person that rejects the way, that person that knows better, that person that's been revealed to him that he still refuses to walk in God's way. What will happen to that person? What is it going to be? Yes, he broke the seal that kept us from the shikina glory because sin was finished. Jesus gives a particular reason and I was reading of another writer I believe in Matthew Henry's commentary just portions uh because the message of the hour my commentary Jesus gives a particular reason why they should weep for themselves and for their children. He said that what people normally dread and these are my words uh as I read out of one writer in Matthew Henry's what people normally dread that they would actually desire said blessed are the they would the days will come when they will say blessed are the wombs that don't bear that's not what we desire &gt;&gt; people desire to have children desire ire to have someone to love. They desire that and some are not able to have that. We understand that. And there has been prayer made for those that have not had children and and God has answered marvelously. And then the others there's others and sitting here in this congregation and perhaps listening to me today and will listen to this that have not been able to have children and God knows that and there's some reason for that. But we commit that as if you're a believer then you just thank God for it. &gt;&gt; But there are some and then and but that is something. So Jesus is saying they will say blessed are the womb that blessed is the womb that doesn't bear. But yet that's not what a woman would desire. They would desire to bear and the paps that never gave suck. And he said for the days will come when they will say that because something's going to happen. In other words, it will be better that way for the conditions that are around for the things that are taking place for the world that has sunk into the vile filth and vengeance of this day. When law and order can scarcely keep things together and when we find the days and the conditions that we are in and people are saying it's better not to even have children. Multitudes, millions never get married, don't want to get married. It's too big a headache. The dangers are too the the potential for danger and heartbreak is too great. And are some that have had marriage and have had divorce and have had marriage and divorce and then they were filled with all that's why brother Brandham came to that subject and we're not coming to that subject. Those are painful things friends. Those are very painful things. You cannot even weigh the pain that people have have endured that. And so Jesus is saying the day will come. &gt;&gt; And that a lot of the writers in the commentaries want to uh attribute all of that, but Matthew Henry didn't attribute all of that to the destruction of Jerusalem. That the days are coming and that that would be when Jerusalem is destroyed by Titus that the people would say, "Oh, it better not to have children." Well, that wasn't the full reference to it because dispensationally now we've come to an end time. H how can you go in in one lifetime you're looking at a person that never used to lock their door? I never locked our door. I never locked the car. It didn't even I thought people were crazy and nuts to lock their door. What do you want to lock your door for? Nothing's going to happen. That was in my time. When I was a young married man with children, &gt;&gt; we never locked our door. Well, we do today. And and you say, "Well, don't you trust God?" Well, yeah. I trust God. I also trust the locks. There's just, you know, that's just uh Do you lock your door? &gt;&gt; I'm sure most people do. You have an alarm system and all of those things. Why, you know, anyhow, uh we'll go on from there. Often those that have no children envy those that have children. Then those that have children very often find themselves uh find them such a burden especially in attempting to escape the attraction of the world. These are my words or the grief of seeing them suffer and dying from famine from disease from wars. I'm sure that we can sit here in our comfort and sit here in the safety of this country. Let me tell you something. Safety can disappear very quickly. &gt;&gt; Things can change in a moment of time. People that put their trust in the e economy. The economics can collapse. Even the people who are in charge of the economics realize it can just go downhill overnight. &gt;&gt; We know that. &gt;&gt; And many here have experienced that. We've gone through recessions and depressions and whatever more. I stood as a boy watching my father peeling railroad ties for 10 cents a tie. You say, "Well, that was, you know, back in the dark ages." Not quite. That happens very, very quickly in one person's lifetime. Where'd the last 10 years go for you? Where some of you, where' the last 20 years go for you? Just just gone like that. Isn't that so? And so they go on to say, and I just changed some words for my own self to make it more fitting. So we have the the the children that are in disease and the wars and so and I'm sure that those are people that have passed their mind too. Been better if I hadn't had these children to see their stomach swollen and to see you say, well I is this just to be, you know, is this just to kind of catch our attention? No. No, no, this is reality. This is what God sees. And there isn't one of those children that cry that but what God hears that if he hears the animals and the eagles and the birds and all the rest of it, he certainly hears creation &gt;&gt; that he made in his image. &gt;&gt; And and he says, "And they will envy those that have none, those that have brought children. Conditions will become and a good part of the world it's that way. even today &gt;&gt; when they will envy and blessed are the barren. But Satan is too subtle to just use like famine and disease and wars and sickness. What do we've got are gay parades? &gt;&gt; Are they celebrating children? Are they celebrating life? &gt;&gt; No, they're not. &gt;&gt; They're celebrating no children. They're celebrating no family. &gt;&gt; Are they celebrating raising children that are going to be scientists and astronauts or artists or teachers or preachers or what? No, they're not celebrating that. They're celebrating the fact that none are coming. Right? &gt;&gt; They're literally saying, "Blessed are the wombs that don't bear &gt;&gt; and the pops that don't don't give sir. &gt;&gt; I have your attention. &gt;&gt; This is the day. &gt;&gt; What will you do in the end thereof?" Yes. &gt;&gt; And Satan would like to uh I I I I prayed earnestly that God would help me and give me the words, but he's continuously and so persistently bringing something in front of the people, in front of message believers, just brings it. course language and vile living and all kinds of things and things that are and just such insanity just bring it until finally people say well you know that's the way it is and you know it becomes common place &gt;&gt; and finally accepted &gt;&gt; as the normal normal &gt;&gt; send Elijah send Moses send any of the prophets there would curse that thing &gt;&gt; and say this is not normal This is not holy. &gt;&gt; This is not of God. This is of another kingdom. This came from darkness. &gt;&gt; This is death. &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us &gt;&gt; the scripture tells us that he will be very successful in the end. and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, do obedience to him, &gt;&gt; kneel to him. And that word is to actually like to take a hand and to kiss it and to be acceptance and to have a certain degree of reverence to it. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb's lamb from the foundation of the world. And when we read that, we must have something rise up within us. Thank you, Father, that you sent one worthy &gt;&gt; to open that book and to declare our names. And something that was spoken out from the revelation of Jesus Christ responds to me until I can say that's my name. &gt;&gt; I have been called. I don't know about the next person. I don't know about anyone else but my name was called something within says that's the life &gt;&gt; that's the craving I have &gt;&gt; that's what I respond to &gt;&gt; can you say amen to that &gt;&gt; don't get don't get comfortable &gt;&gt; with this world &gt;&gt; just keep saying this world is not my home &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. &gt;&gt; The results and consequences of sin evolve into con into into conditions so vile that a loving and just God responds with holy justice on a sin-loving Satan's Eden. Don't forget the green tree. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The tree of life. paid a horrific consequence &gt;&gt; for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, if it is possible, &gt;&gt; let this cup pass from me. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just sit in so much comfort that we forget the penalty and as the prophet spoke, the terrible consequence and penalty of sin. &gt;&gt; We want to forever be thankful. &gt;&gt; We're thankful. We remembering on Remembrance Day those that have gone and and fought for us that we could be here in a in a degree of comfort and safety and so on. We're happy about that. We're thankful for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And some of the best crop of the land of America, of Canada, and many other countries, &gt;&gt; right? They died in their youth 18, 19, 20, 21 in early 20s and and their blood soaked the earth &gt;&gt; so that we could have relatively relative freedom. But this can disappear very quickly &gt;&gt; and this is not, you know, something to startle the people. This is reality &gt;&gt; and much of the world is in a great deal of suffering because it's the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the scripture says, God speaking, the scripture says, "And things shall wax worse and worse." &gt;&gt; Not better and better, but worse and worse. &gt;&gt; Friends, that's why we have an unchanging word of God, &gt;&gt; unchanging message and an uncompromising messenger. And I thank God for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then shall they begin to say to the mountains, "Fall on us, and to the hills, cover us." In other words, they would wish to be buried alive or hid in the darkest caves that they may be out of the noise of these calamities. and Revelation 6:16 that they would not flee to Christ for refuge but put themselves under his protection will in vain call for the hills and mountains to shelter them from his wrath. That's what the Bible speaks of. If they do these things in the green tree, what shall they do in the dry? If God delivers me up to such sufferings, speaking of Christ now, if God delivers Jesus up to such sufferings as the as these because because I made a sacrifice for sin, what will he do with sinners themselves? &gt;&gt; Christ was a green tree, fruitful and flourishing. Now if such things were done to him, we we may then infer what would have been done to the whole race of mankind if he had not interposed if he had not come &gt;&gt; and what shall be done to those who con who continue dry trees. Listen friends, I'm glad for a unco uncompromising message that identified the drive tree, &gt;&gt; the whole system of religion. &gt;&gt; I said earlier, Satan is so cunning. &gt;&gt; He's gotten into every area of life that's necessary to humankind. every area, whether it be politics, whether it be military, whether it be whatever power, whether it be educational, whether it be a person's love life or marriage or religion or whatever. And he he loves to be in religion so he can get behind the pullpit. &gt;&gt; He says, "If God did this to the son of his love, I was thinking very very deep. I've allowed my mind to go, my heart, my soul as I've read and pondered these things. God allowed Judas to betray him. &gt;&gt; God allowed Rome to play a part. &gt;&gt; God allowed the people to cry out, "Crucify! Crucify!" Right. &gt;&gt; But it was God's will &gt;&gt; in behind driving everything. &gt;&gt; And he gave those people an opportunity. &gt;&gt; Here he is. Do what you wish. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "You slew the prophets. You killed them everyone. I sent them to you &gt;&gt; and you did what you would &gt;&gt; to them." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; In other words, they had the opportunity to hear the prophets. &gt;&gt; They had the opportunity to hear God's voice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But God sent that so that they could make their choice and do what they wish to do with it. And now he said if God sent this if God did this to the son of his love when he found sin but but imputed to him. Jesus never sinned but taking your sin and my sin. And when God saw our sin &gt;&gt; on him, &gt;&gt; he sent the tree of life to hell &gt;&gt; to pay the full penalty. And in hell, he was still victorious. He was still a mighty conqueror. And he stripped the Satan of the keys of death, hell, and the grave. And arose again, and emptied out paradise. Hallelujah. From Eve and Adam all the way through. Who is it? It's the son of righteousness &gt;&gt; that has risen with healing in his wings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he says and and what shall God what shall he do to the generation of his wrath? See, that's why I say it's not just Jerusalem. What shall he do? Look what he did with Titus and and all the rest of it because they rejected Jesus Christ. That might that's very localized. But now we're people of the earth. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we're people who are connected with the web. &gt;&gt; We're www. people. We're connected with the whole world. You sit in your office and you you you find out all kinds of things all over and talk to people and whatever more get questions answered. Whatever more God's talking about when Jesus said, "What will they do to a dry tree?" What will happen to people who have refused the green tree, the tree of life, and only take the tree of knowledge? What will happen friends? We don't want to be connected to that dry tree. We don't want these dead religions. I want no part of these dead religions. They can't be they can't bear my sin. I have that dry tree, the tree of life that took all of my frailties, and all of my uh wrongs and all of my mistakes and all of my sin and all of my iniquity and took it to hell and paid the price. &gt;&gt; And I want to give him praise, &gt;&gt; openly. Give him glory. &gt;&gt; No one could do that but him. &gt;&gt; He took the penalty upon himself &gt;&gt; and paid the price. Jesus paid it all. &gt;&gt; All to him I owe. &gt;&gt; Sin and left a crimson stain, but he washed it white as snow. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What will he do? What will the just and holy God do? Why are you saying this, brother Bisl? Because you're rubbing shoulders with it every day. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have the influence of it very near you, in your family, in your home. I was thinking of the conditions of the dry tree, the conditions of the world. In Satan's Eden, the prophet spoke and he said, "I wanted to speak to you something to bring something to enlighten you to the promise of God for this age. But I thought I would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures I got written down that would enlighten you to know to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now. to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you. &gt;&gt; That's the main thing &gt;&gt; is to learn to keep the punches off you as much as possible. &gt;&gt; Listen, congregation Cloverdale Bible way and whoever hears this, what do you think that school building is standing there? Think that we're trying to make a name for ourselves? You think we're trying to make some presentation in the community? Not a bit. &gt;&gt; No. has to try to keep the punches off of our children. &gt;&gt; That's because we're trying to we we we read what Satan's tactics are. &gt;&gt; We studied him. &gt;&gt; We see what he's done through the schools. We see what he's done &gt;&gt; through the books, through the learning and all of these things. And we want not only no part of it, but it's up to us. I feel I feel compelled to protect the children and their minds and the purity of their minds from that thing. And God bless every mother and father that homeschools their children. I say, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; It's enough of this rotten sex. &gt;&gt; Why do they need to hear this when they're in grade one and grade two? Why do they need to read books that two two men are the same as a man and his wife? That's of the devil. that came from the pit. Or two women can be mother and father, not a chance. Not as long as we have a voice. And let your voice be heard. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's not just a concrete building. That's to keep the punches off our children. And this church, every person ought to support it with everything that you have &gt;&gt; emotionally and financially in every which way. [Music] Do we want to see our children or see someone? I don't want to even see my enemy pay the penalty that Jesus had to pay. &gt;&gt; But if they do this in a green tree, what will they do in the dry? &gt;&gt; People going to trust their own mind. &gt;&gt; As in opposition to the into the messengers this kind of world that he came to. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let let us look at the great sinful day that we're now living in. I don't believe that there was ever a day that I've ever read in history. &gt;&gt; There's been greater days of persecution. when the children of God was put to death on every hand. &gt;&gt; But to see the de deceitfulness. &gt;&gt; Now here I want you to hang on to every word. But to see the deceitfulness of the enemy. We've never had a day like this like we're living in. It's the most cunning, deceitful day. Why am I emphasizing this? Because we need to have our senses sharpened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to become more aware. &gt;&gt; We need to allow our convictions to run deep &gt;&gt; and we need to be able to stand whether we say anything or not. We stand. Let people know I have no part of that. &gt;&gt; I'm not part of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the most cunning and deceitful day. And when I see that, it brings this that the Christians has to be more on his toe today than ever was in any age. And I say to Cloverdale, Bible way, regardless of your position or where you are in life, we need to be more on our toes, not less on our toes, more alert, &gt;&gt; more conscious when we see things try to creep into your life or into your home or into the church. We we we have a we have a characteristic of resistance. I'm opposed to that. I don't have to strike and fight and war or whatever more. I'm opposed to that. I'm I'm withstanding that by my very life, by my very stature and posture. &gt;&gt; I am against that. Even my silence &gt;&gt; to things. My silence &gt;&gt; is in opposition to it. &gt;&gt; When they accuse Jesus, he remains silent. &gt;&gt; His silence condemned them. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not a war of words. It's just being silent. That's the hardest thing to do to be silent. &gt;&gt; And just to look. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I remember once, I'll never forget it. Uh, you know, we never got into Halloween and all of those things, but this is before the message and my father was living staying with us. He was working for me and uh it was in Toronto and Halloween come and you know the girls wanted to go around and so they kind of dressed up in some simple little costume and and uh they were kind of running through the house and excited about going out is simple simple stuff but I saw my father look at them and I just saw the I won't say disregard but saw he I saw his disapproval all over his face. Never forgot it. I'm his only son. I just saw him look at them in total disapproval. He never said a word. Never said a word to me. Never said a word to them. I never forgot it. Did he preach me a message? Yep. Preached me a message. Was he still father to me? Yeah, he was father to me. Did he influence my life? Yeah, he influenced my life. Did he do his job? Yeah, he did his job. Never said a word. &gt;&gt; Here I am, 79 years old. I remember it to this day just exactly the way it all happened. &gt;&gt; And I knew right then he didn't approve of that. All right. The prophet said, uh, your birth here was pre-planned. &gt;&gt; So, what are we talking about? We're talking about the end time. God pre-planned you for this day. &gt;&gt; You're not an accident. &gt;&gt; You're not a myth. You're not somebody that just, you know, two man and a woman got together, a father and a mother, a husband and a wife, and decide, let's have some children. You're not the product of that desire. You that have become believers, you're the product of God's &gt;&gt; program. He's the one who determined you should come. &gt;&gt; You need to get there. You need to get to that point. I'm here by divine intervention. &gt;&gt; I'm here by a divine program. &gt;&gt; I am here on a commission. &gt;&gt; What are you here for? &gt;&gt; Just to make your way and struggle through life and, you know, rattle about this and rant about that and and complain about this and be happy about that. Is that what you're here for? &gt;&gt; No. Not believers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not believers. &gt;&gt; You'll probably be happy when this service is over, but nevertheless, &gt;&gt; I'll leave you with some things to think about. &gt;&gt; You're pre-planned. I guess you believe that. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned. Did you know that your being here never originated just as a as at a myth or a thought? Everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here. &gt;&gt; So, you're here and I'd like you all to agree with me on this. As much as I am called or any of these brothers are called, you are called. God has you here for a specific reason. &gt;&gt; I want you to go out of these doors today, say, "I was pre-planned by Almighty God &gt;&gt; to be here." &gt;&gt; And I've got more things to say about that as we go along. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God also equipped you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not like a country that may send a soldier out and doesn't give doesn't I'm sorry, we don't have any guns or any bullets. No, he equipped you &gt;&gt; for this day. He equipped you The prophet also said there's two books that Satan really hates. He said while he hates the whole word of God but he hates Genesis and Revelations. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And of course this message is this message exposes him. &gt;&gt; He says but if anything he Satan despises mostly is Revelation in Genesis. &gt;&gt; Right? Remember this now because &gt;&gt; because Genesis tells his beginning &gt;&gt; and Revelation reveals what's going to happen to him in the last day. &gt;&gt; You think he's happy about this? He's not. &gt;&gt; He's roaring, &gt;&gt; ranting. &gt;&gt; Whether you hear it or not, it's not for your physical ears to hear or your physical eyes to see, but that's what's going on. And he's using the most cunning and every device and every deceiving thing to creep into our home, &gt;&gt; our life, &gt;&gt; our church, &gt;&gt; our whole society, &gt;&gt; our country, &gt;&gt; whatever more, whoever you identify with. And that is precisely why he inspires people to doubt the message. because by doing so he can conceal himself in their doubt. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I want to say that again. &gt;&gt; That is precisely why he hates this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And why he inspires people to doubt the message because by doing so he can conceal himself &gt;&gt; in their doubt. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no sin &gt;&gt; in not understanding something. &gt;&gt; I heard brother Brandon say the other day, he said, "I don't understand this." &gt;&gt; There's no requirement. &gt;&gt; There's nothing in the scripture that says, "And thou shalt understand all things." &gt;&gt; Jesus simply said, "Believest thou this." &gt;&gt; Do you believe this? &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. This message has found such a place &gt;&gt; within the human mind of religious people that it's impossible impossible to disregard it. &gt;&gt; Because I said to my wife driving here to this service, it was Jesus Christ when he was on earth. Both loved and hated. &gt;&gt; He was a good man, a good teacher, a good this, a good that. even wanted to make him king &gt;&gt; of the nation. That was the limits of their understanding. But when it came to crucify, crucify, they're out on the streets. Crucify him. Crucify him because there's no anchor there whatsoever. Were not born. Had no revelation that he was the word of God made flesh. Had no revelation that he's going to go to hell on their behalf. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; that just rocks me to my feet &gt;&gt; when I think of that. &gt;&gt; So, in in in a certain message, I'm going to read the dagot. Brother Brandon refers to the scriptures of Paul to Timothy. But understand this, we say in the last days perilous time shall come. But I like to read it from the dagot. Uh not the diagot rather, but the uh amplified version. But understand this that in the last days there will set in perilous times of great stress and trouble, hard to deal with and hard to bear. For people will be lovers of their self of self and utterly self-centered lovers of money and a and a and a aroused by an inordinate greedy desire for wealth. Proud and arrogant and contemptuous boasters. They will be abusive, blasphemous scoffers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy and profane. They will be without natural human affection, callous and inhuman. I didn't believe I would ever live to see the day where I could see men and women or women just up and leave their children. &gt;&gt; That may sound strange to you. I had an old house over here many years ago and it became a girl's house when God began to move upon the young people and I had a friend who was a carpenter and I took him through the old house and he he said better call in a bulldozer and just mow this thing down. And I felt in my heart because I could see God moving on the young people and there's young men on the streets and young ladies and they're getting saved. They're out of very dysfunctional homes and some of them were away from home because there was a lot of hippie and w and w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w wand. So I thought, well, if God calls these people or calls any one of them, I'd have it. So I jacked it up and fixed it up and made a girl's home out of it. But prior to that, I was just letting people live in it at a very very low rent. And one day I got a phone call from a man and he said uh uh the family, he gave them my he gave them a name. He said uh you know that this family has left. I said, "No, I didn't know." And it had snowed and the wind was blowing and I want to describe it to you. And two of the boys went to school with my girls and they were in high school. I think one was in about grade 10. And so I went over to the house and I didn't have to push the door open. The door was open and snow had blown in. And you talk about a desolate. And I thought just think a family lived here. A man and his wife and about three boys lived in this house. And I I walked in. you can walk in with me. And there's the kitchen table and there's plates on the table that I could even tell you they had they had macaroni and meatballs or something cuz they were still dirty on the table. And I looked around. Here's the pictures of the family. Here's the mother with the children and and they're just gone. I've never seen them to this day. They're just gone. let those boys in school, two of them in school and those kids and this man told me, I don't know if you know, but those boys are sleeping there. There's no heat in the house. And and so he wanted me to try to do something. I walked over and I I just could not believe that those boys, two high school boys. These people are parents. This is a father. This is a mother. I'm not speaking friends of stories. I'm talking of experience. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about what God has said in his word. We're living in that day. &gt;&gt; People who are fathers, grandfathers, just gone. Not caring anything about seeing their children or their grandchildren or anybody else. Just gone. &gt;&gt; It just vacates them. I've &gt;&gt; seen children forget their parents, you know, put them away someplace and never go and see them again. &gt;&gt; I'll say to my kids that are here, don't you ever dare do that to me. I know they say no danger. I'll be on the phone. Hi, I need you. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? without natural or human affection. &gt;&gt; Just gone. &gt;&gt; And they'll be without natural or human affection, callous and inhuman, relentless, admitting of no truths or appeasement. They will be slanderers, false accusers, troublemakers, intemperate and loose in the morals and conduct, uncontrolled and fierce and haters of good. They will be treacherous betrayers, rash and inflated with self-conceit. They will be lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amusements more than and rather than lovers of God. And although they hold a form of piety, they'll go to church, they'll sing songs that you sang, &gt;&gt; they'll hold a book and hold a prayer book and whatever more. And although they hold a form of piety, true religion, that the form of true religion, they deny and reject and are strangers to the power of it. Their conduct belies the genuiness of their profession. Avoid avoid all such people. &gt;&gt; Turn away from them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; are you listening? I have the quote here. God has not only pre-planned that you'd live here when these things exist, &gt;&gt; but he's empowered you to overcome them. &gt;&gt; He's empowered you to resist them. He's empowered you and given you knowledge so that you can understand what what's going on in the world. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. Satan is in the average school. He's in the average church. He's in the average government. And the prophet said, "All governments, all education." &gt;&gt; Those are strong things to say. But the reason he's saying this is because that prophetic eye can see the enemy creeping in. He's in business. &gt;&gt; He's in He's in business. He's in your profession. He's in your workplace. &gt;&gt; He's in your computer. [Music] &gt;&gt; Come on. You might as well say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan's in every computer. &gt;&gt; Do you think they would have used the web at a at a good purpose for their purposes back in the days of Jesus? Yes, they would have used it to full extent. and they would have said all kinds of things about them and you'd still be able to pull it up. &gt;&gt; And there's things that do you ever realize that it's not erased. It can't go any place. &gt;&gt; It's there. They put it up. That's the age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said, these are his words. I'll come to it. He said, "You've been pressurized for this age." &gt;&gt; And that I want you to agree with. &gt;&gt; And I want you to say it while you're sitting in your seat. I am pressurized for this age. &gt;&gt; I'm pressurized to resist it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The deception of this age is due to many cunning methods Satan uses. He presents anything that appeals to the senses of the fallen nature &gt;&gt; continuously and persistently. And I know that as you listen here, you may think that I'm going overboard. No, not any not any too much. Not any too much. We here behind this pulpit are not as relentless as Satan is &gt;&gt; in the world. &gt;&gt; He uses every possible means &gt;&gt; to get to your eyes, to get to your ears. And whether you like it or hate it, you'll hear it. You'll hear the thumping of the music in a restaurant where the food is nice because it's both good and evil. That's true. &gt;&gt; Why is all the fine spots, all you talk about beaches, say, "Oh my goodness, you went to a beach. I should be able to go to a beach without all the nakedness, &gt;&gt; without all the vile impurities, with all the I should be able to walk into a restaurant without the bars and all of this nonsense. We should be able to have it. Why should I have to live in the city where the where the uh gay community walk right up to the city hall, our new $130 million city hall and and insist on raising their flag with the flag of British Columbia and the flag of Canada. Can you believe that? You talk about that is the same spirit that is so brazen that would come to the tree of life himself and say, "Worship me. If you will worship me, I'll give you all this. But what's he saying? If you'll just worship me, I'll give you all this garbage. &gt;&gt; I'll give you all these kingdoms. They're going to fall anyway. Listen, friends, I'm preaching, you might as well say amen to it. &gt;&gt; And they will never forget being brazen because that's the spirit that's in them. to be brazen, to be proud, to make it a social a social standing in the community. They'll never make that unclean living comfortable for me. &gt;&gt; God has pressurized you. You better believe what this prophet said. &gt;&gt; God has pressurized you to this age. &gt;&gt; You don't have to fear it. You don't have to succumb to it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to give your ear to it. You don't have to give your eye to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've been made for another world &gt;&gt; and you've had a messenger come with a word that answers to your soul &gt;&gt; and that happens to be calling your name &gt;&gt; you just pray for me now. &gt;&gt; Endless voices of religion &gt;&gt; coarse language bizarre and outlandish. I I will get over this in just a moment. Outlandish. My wife and I, we we're told by our medical people, by the doctor, do you exercise? Do you exercise? Do you exercise? I hear that all the time. Do you exercise? And we say, well, we walk. So, we try to walk. And even even a little simple prominad in white rock, my wife says to me every once in a while said it just the other day, you can wear anything. I said, yeah, you don't have to wear anything. You can wear anything. He says, it's absolutely bizarre. Kinky, beyond kinky, insane. I said, no, they've just turned River, they just opened the doors of Riverview Institution. You know, we don't have an ins insane institution. You folks on the US side, you might have one. We don't have one. Canada just opened all the doors and let all the people out. And here a prophet said years ago, and I didn't understand what he said years ago, he said the streets would be full of insan insanity. &gt;&gt; We don't have Riverview. Riverview. I've been in Riverview. I've sat I've sat with I've sat with the doctors in Riverview over over a young man who was delivered and they were trying to find out, you know, with their mind what happened to him. He said, "What do you do? What do you do with your medication?" He said, "Well, I flushed it down the toilet." "Oh," he said, just in his quiet still voice. "Oh, you flushed it down the toilet." "Yes." He asked me, "What did we do with this young man that made such a change in five weeks?" So we we didn't do anything. We prayed for him. &gt;&gt; I said, "He worked in the garden." He was trying to figure out what what brought such a change to him. Totally demonpossessed young man had been. And then he sat there free. You know who I speak of. So he said, "Mr. Biscll, do you believe in exorcism?" Well, I know what exorcism is, casting out of devils. And so I wanted to play ignorant. I said, "What does that mean?" He said, "Well, it is it is the practice of casting out of devils." I said, 'Well, as Jesus practiced it, I believe in it. All right. Well, that didn't answer his question. So, he went on to another one. Do you believe in something else? And I do you believe in, you know, you can do this? And I said, well, as Jesus taught it and told us, I believe it. And then he asked a third question. I just went back, put my back against the Bible. Well, as Jesus said it, &gt;&gt; I believe it. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Listen, doctor," I said, "I'm sorry. I I I don't want to, you know, play games with you, but I said, if you want to know what I believe, I believe that all mental illness is first a spiritual illness." And he he just let down all the guard. He says, "Well," he says, "I tend to agree with you." So there's a psychologist in the insane asylum saying that all everything in there was really a spiritual problem. Why don't they deal with the spiritual problem if they feel that was what it was? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He also received the deception of the cares and the and uh that are made superior to God. He also that receiveth seed among the thorns is that heareth the word and carth and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful. &gt;&gt; And just before I go to some slides and we'll read some things together. Are you not too weary? &gt;&gt; If thou hast run, this is in Jeremiah 12:5. If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with the horses? And if in the land of peace, wherein thou trust us, you're living in a land of peace. And if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustest, they wearied thee. Now don't look at me and say I'm not weary. I hear from so many. I hear it in my own home. We get weary. You get weary. &gt;&gt; Life is wearing. &gt;&gt; I would say on probably 100% of the people here that are adult, life is weary. And if in a land of peace, wherein thou trustest, they weary they, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? &gt;&gt; How will thou do when Jordan rolls in? &gt;&gt; In the end thereof, &gt;&gt; right? In the for forgotten biatitude, brother Brandham talks about John the Baptist and he said, "John, well, I have this on slide, so I'll if you'll just dim the lights a wee bit, please." John the Baptist, it thought, well, now I introduced a Messiah, that he had his fan in his hand, and he was going to purge the floors and take his wheat into the garner. And I told him that the axe was laid to the root of the tree, and he was going to take all the trash and burn it up. And here he is, instead of great mighty man like that, here he comes, meek and lowly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Something must have went wrong somewhere. He said, "There's no doubt, but something's wrong somewhere." He thought it isn't right. He became dismayed like many of us do. When we see things going on that isn't what we think is just right, we become dismayed. &gt;&gt; We've all been there. said, &gt;&gt; "And you may well be there this morning." And he goes on to say, "Don't be weary." [Music] &gt;&gt; It will be all right. &gt;&gt; I thank God &gt;&gt; for that kind of word. &gt;&gt; Don't be weary. &gt;&gt; It'll be all right. &gt;&gt; That's the God that we have. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, well, you don't know what I'm going through. Yes, God knows what you're going through. &gt;&gt; If I don't know what you're going through, God knows what you're going through. God knows all about that thing because he's he knows that his arch enemy has permeated the entire civilization. &gt;&gt; More so, this is the end time, friends. &gt;&gt; This is the end time. &gt;&gt; Don't think we're not we're going to be there with without we're going to be here without a battle. We're going to have battles, &gt;&gt; but we're pressurized for this age. &gt;&gt; We're pressurized to withstand anything that comes. &gt;&gt; But you have to be able to resist it. You have to resist it. And I felt I felt led of the Holy Spirit to relate to them experiences. I know that they came to speak their heart, but instead I poured out my heart and they will understand more after this service. And I I felt that I I felt led to tell them of the opportunities, the great opportunities that Satan presented. Oh, it was so glamorous. It was so rewarding. It was Was there anything sinful? No, nothing sinful. It was just a such success and things and at that time and one night can't even sleep all night more than people would make in a lifetime was hanging right there already accepted. And I couldn't sleep. And in the morning I said, "Call them and tell them no, I won't do it. I can't do it." And first and foremost, I would have to leave the church for a year. I wasn't prepared to do that. Friends, sometimes the the the the most glorious thing that is presented to you, &gt;&gt; whether it be in business, whether it be in sports, whether it be in beauty, or whether it be in talents, I'm not here to be boastful at all. I'm just here to tell you the truth. If I pass away tonight or tomorrow and gone, at least I'll have this message off my heart. &gt;&gt; My daughter sang And they sang a song that I first picked up from down someone sang it at Jeffersonville. It is I be not afraid. And it it was it was rhythmic song, footapping song. Oh, it is I be not afraid. This is the reply that the master gave and I thought, you know, and they were just singing it with all their energy of their youth and so on so forth. the director that was one of the big studios downtown and the director was the director of the choir of the large Pentecostal church downtown and he says he says put that in my hands and I'll put them on the top 10 of gospel music and I answered immediately I said that's precisely what we don't want &gt;&gt; there's time to say no Amen. &gt;&gt; To this congregation, you will have opportunities. &gt;&gt; Your children will have opportunities. And as fathers, as parents, there's times when we have to put on the brakes &gt;&gt; and say, "No, that is not the direction. That happens to be the world. And I do not want Satan to get an advantage within this home, within this structure &gt;&gt; through their through their their super intelligence or their super ability or their super skill or anything else. &gt;&gt; You may be glad to see me get out of this pulpit, but I've got to let it all out. &gt;&gt; Do you support it? &gt;&gt; You understand it? I'm preaching for your benefit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; in the message shalom. Peace. Don't be weary. &gt;&gt; This is to you, friend. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Don't be weary. Why? He says Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not some figment of your imagination. Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; The word is here. &gt;&gt; The answer's here. &gt;&gt; Don't go stumbling off your own direction in the shadows and in the darkness when the light is here. Jesus is here. The word is here. The revelation of him is here. His voice is here. You can hear it. You have the advantage of hearing it. &gt;&gt; You have the privilege of hearing it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; His great light has come to us and we're thankful for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. his word, the great mystery. Here he is today manifesting himself, doing the same as he did then. You might say, "Well, I don't see him manifesting himself." Open your eyes. Here we are. [Music] &gt;&gt; I stand here as a witness today and I'm unashshamed of the witness of Jesus Christ. Even though there's all kinds of opportunities in the world and whether it be whether it be women or whether it be men or whether it be whatever it is, God give a conviction inside for you and for me and for believers of this word. We we have a sharpened conviction inside. And that there's a time to say yes. I yield. And there's a time to say no. &gt;&gt; That's going to cost me too much. that's going to cost me spiritually. I'm going to say no. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. God will stand behind that. &gt;&gt; Go as far as you can. Get all the education you can. Get all the money you can. Give all you can. Do all you can for the kingdom of God. But one thing for sure, let your life be completely surrendered to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I see some of you young ladies and maybe you've passed the pass through your mind think, "Oh, if I could only find Mr. Per," you won't find him. If I could only find him the right person, all my problems would be solved. Well, I'm here to tell you, no, all your problems just start. Not really. I've had a wonderful marriage, but they say they've been made in heaven, but there's a lot of work to do on earth. &gt;&gt; Do we still have a few more minutes, please? Now, I need your full attention just starting now. We are going to the message and I'm going to go through it by sequence and you're going to read with me parts of it which is the present stage of my ministry. Now don't forget it's prophetic. &gt;&gt; It's prophetic and and and he took it in such a way he said being very tired and worn of himself down the east coast and also up the west coast. If you notice the time, it's 1962, the 9th, which would be September. And he's just been with us in Victoria and over in Port Alurnie and with the native Indian people up the west coast into Canada and with the fine cooperation of all the different denominational churches. That was absolutely true. organizations which cooperated not just in those meetings but in that whole tour having great meetings had great success as far as could be called success today and perhaps maybe uh many would call it great but myself I'm a revivalist and the revival nationally speaking is just about ended so now you'll get the thought and now this is to the many peoples and friends of mine around the world I wish to state tonight here in the tabernacle people are packed in all around stand indoors and outside in their cars and things he's got the church is packed if he's not speaking to a handful of people the church is packed and all right, but nevertheless, this is what he's getting across to us. Regardless of whether the church is packed, but I've come to this place that I want to explain what stage of time &gt;&gt; we're living in &gt;&gt; according to the ministry that the Lord give me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're here under that. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're here under that ministry. &gt;&gt; You're product of that. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. And so he says, I've come now to a place they want to explain. He wants to explain to you what you're experiencing and why we experience these things. And I wanted to record it from the tabernacle to come on my heart last spring, but I waited till I got back here so I could give uh get a recording of it and sent to the people of the world. He reads a scripture and I'm reading this scripture. We are in the stage of time and must be in the spirit of the world. He takes a scripture. I re I I charge thee therefore before God in the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quicken the dead at his appearing. Preach the word be instant in season out of season. Reprove, rebuke, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine. Say within your own self, by God's grace, I will not be part of that number. &gt;&gt; For the time will come. Why? Because of the age, because of the infiltration, &gt;&gt; because of the attack of the enemy, because of the invasion of darkness, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; that will take place. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts or desires shall heap to themselves teachers having itching ears, and they shall turn away their ears from the truth. &gt;&gt; They shall turn away their ears from people. We don't have to turn our ears away. We have to turn our ears towards the truth. Say, I'm here to hear that. &gt;&gt; And and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things. Endure afflictions. Do the work of an evangelist. Make full proof of thy ministry. And he said that fifth verse was a verse he always had stopped and that they'll be turned under fables. But he said now he felt inclined and felt urged to go to the fifth verse. But watch thou in all things endure afflictions and do the work of an evangelist. Make full proof of thy ministry. He said and and we live here now in three dimensions, light, matter and time and our five senses contact them dimensions. But we have contact through science, the fourth dimension, because coming right through the building now comes pictures, voices of radio, pictures of television, but our senses does not contact that. &gt;&gt; But yet they have a tube. I have a reason for saying this, friends. So stay with it, please. That picks up those other waves and manifests them. So all of these voices that are going through here, we have instruments or devices that will pick that up. I have a a cell phone. It'll pick up. They don't want me to have it here because it it messes up the sound. And he says, but and manifest them. They're here. We know it. They're absolutely truth. It proves to us that there is a fourth dimension. Now the fifth dimension is where the sinner &gt;&gt; the unbeliever dies and goes. &gt;&gt; And when a Christian dies he goes into the sixth dimension &gt;&gt; and God is in the seventh dimension. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham at this point he just goes into some detail. I'm going to just rehearse it quickly. He saw a documentary or something on on I believe it was a television program or something. He saw this and it was of a deep sea uh submarine went way way deep into the ocean. And uh he said they saw really unusual and very hideous kind of sea life. And one was a fish that had no eyes. And and he said he had a sense with some kind of a sauna or something where he he could sense and get his food. And but he had no eyes. And he says, "And I thought that this fish that had no eyes." And he says, "But they were guided by another sense so they could contact their food." And he said, "I thought I thought then, oh, if if I could only guide that little fish, if I could just guide him, if I could if I could direct him, if he could have my eyes, if he could see like I see." And uh he said, "If I could have control of that little fish with my sight, how much greater could I supply his food and lead him places? How much greater my sight is than his radar? He contacts. He says, "And then and then it came to me." And then it came to me. If I could only surrender myself to God, &gt;&gt; how much greater is the sight and senses of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who could guide us much more than the things that we see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the faith that he supplies supplies us is the evidence of things not seen with our eyes. Then if that little fish could never come up then if that little fish could never come up to the top of the water like other fish because he's pressurized. Said if he did it explode but he said he's pressurized no more than we can go up higher and keep from exploding. We are pressurized for the place that we live in. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And everybody wants to be in agreement with that. &gt;&gt; Go out this door. Don't succumb. &gt;&gt; Don't feel weary. &gt;&gt; Well, I just can't stand it. Put your shoulders back. So, I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; God has sent me his own personal voice. It is answer to my soul. &gt;&gt; This isn't something that's just good in church, friends. &gt;&gt; I don't want this just to be a church service. &gt;&gt; We're pressurized for the place that we live in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now, if that little fish could ever come up here and be and be me, would he ever want to be that little fish again down in the midnight of blackness? He'd never want to be a fish no more because he's something greater than a fish. He's a man. His senses are greater. His understanding is greater. His intelligent is supreme. Then multiply that by 10 million. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you get what it is when you pass from this into the presence of God yonder. where the human being is so much farther than what we are here. You'd never want to be a human being like this no more down in this pest house of sickness and corruption. &gt;&gt; And I'm sure something down within you is saying that is true. Oh God, there is a place, there is a land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is something. And that's why we live this life. &gt;&gt; That's why we fight these battles. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And this 1962 now friends, I have an advantage that I'm trying to pass off to you. I was with him just after the experience of beyond the curtain of time. And now he refers he relates to it beyond the curtain of time. He doesn't tell the account here but he just said when I seen that place and that condition and those people the condition those people were in and how beyond anything that this world could ever think of it was glorious. There could not be sin there. &gt;&gt; No death or nothing could ever enter that spot. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I hope that I'm able to get this across to you. Churches in the land are filled. Go to any funeral home you wish to go to. They want to put that person that's laying there or their ashes are there. They want to put them in a glorious heavenly place. That is how successful Satan has gotten. When that individual hated anything that was pure, hated godliness, hated the Bible, maybe didn't say they hated the Bible, didn't have any time for it, didn't read it, didn't talk to God, wasn't interested in God. But then some person will get there, wave some metal, burn some incense, and want to put that person up in heaven. They didn't want it down here. What are they doing putting them up there? Somebody's telling a lie. &gt;&gt; Somebody's not being truthful. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you see a 100,000 people and you see a man come out in a frock and put up a couple fingers and say some things about peace, anybody could say it. &gt;&gt; You know, we we should be at peace and you know, may the world have peace and all of these things and all those people, what what what do they think? And then a man is is able to say these kind of things, say more in one paragraph than most people say in their lifetime and can't get the ear of the people, then you know how successful Satan has been at blinding the people and dulling their hearing. And it should behoove us when two men on the way to Emmas who were believers &gt;&gt; and were considering and and reasoning about these things and women from their church had had a vision had been to the sephiler and seen all these things and we've been preaching about it. I'm still on the subject of two worlds. This is a voice from another world. &gt;&gt; And I sat I sat with this man &gt;&gt; on the hillside. You've heard me say it. and he just looked down this magnificent Rocky Mountain trench with beautiful animals down below and and flowers and grass and little willows and just looked down this great vast valley said you know brother Eddie on the other side &gt;&gt; it's just very much like this &gt;&gt; and one day he said when you get over there &gt;&gt; you'll find little paths &gt;&gt; you walk down one of those paths and one of One of one day you'll find me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can't find me when you get over, I might just be walking down one of those trails. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, that's just a figment of imagination. I'd sooner live in that one than live in this one. &gt;&gt; I'd sooner live in the faith and the hope that these words and this Bible is true." And the apostle Paul, oh my, in the present stage of my ministry, the prophet talks about Deeus and how he left Paul. And he said, Paul is writing to Timothy and he's saying, you know, bring my coat and and all all have forsaken me. &gt;&gt; All have forsaken Paul. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right. &gt;&gt; Paul &gt;&gt; who met the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Paul &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham is so kind. He said Deus Deus was a a nice man. &gt;&gt; He said Deus was probably a good preacher. &gt;&gt; Deeus was a good friend. &gt;&gt; But he said he misunderstood &gt;&gt; Paul. He had the wrong opinion of Paul &gt;&gt; because he saw Paul as as as a had great had a great potential, a great ministry, but he's in jail. &gt;&gt; And now he's he's even asking for his coat. He's only got one coat. &gt;&gt; He could have been a success. He mixed he mingled soldier shoulders with millionaires. But there he is in in prison. And he said, "All have forsaken me." and they had &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; and he's going to influence and we read his letters but I wonder friends I don't want us to be hypocritical that we would read his letters and be affected by his letters and yet yet if we had to put ourselves back there would we be standing with Paul or would we be with somebody else [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm being kind of blunt and I [Music] What's the use of having a a a faith or a a and putting forth an image here that we are a certain something, but if we live back there, we're not. &gt;&gt; I want to see ourselves as someone who'd be standing not on the side of the path, but standing with Jesus Christ, standing with the apostles, standing with those that are whatever they were called, fanatics &gt;&gt; or and that's what the prophet said. Oh, they don't want any of these tongue speaking, crying, shouting Pentecostal or or book of Acts people. He said Acts 2:38 people. He doesn't want any of them. Said make the church look like it like it it wasn't it it wasn't a nice nice church. They were impregnated with something else. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No syndicate entered that spot. When I seen those people, he said, "I want to turn, you turn with me to Luke 4:14 and 20, and I want to show you something striking." &gt;&gt; Amen. And here's the scripture. And the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, friend, I'm I hope that you are really alert. I'm really at the heart of my subject right now. This Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; who said, "Don't weep for me. &gt;&gt; Don't lament for me. Lament for your children." &gt;&gt; So the days will come when they say, "Blessed are the wounds that don't bear and the paps that don't give suck." They'll say that now is this Lord Jesus saying he sent me to heal the blind and do these and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book. He says a reference then he referenced Isaiah 611 and two. Now, isn't it strange? And I'll I'll read Isaiah 61 1 and 2 for you. Now, I know that many of you, you know, you know where I'm going, but I'm but this is in a different context. And the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he hath because he hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God. And now he's saying this is such a striking thing because when he got to that part, the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book. &gt;&gt; I'm here to say to you, we're not just members of Cloverdale Bible Way to come here to hear a service. I'm here to say to you, and in our day, in this last day, &gt;&gt; he's opened the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The book that was closed, he's opened the book. &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, he referenced now 61, Isaiah 61 and2. Now, isn't it strange that he stopped right there and the very next verse that was what was applied to his first coming and the second? Next verse is applying to his second coming at judgment. He stopped and closed the book and he he refers to Scofield's note a comparison with the message quoted Isaiah 61 and and two affords the he said where the scripture here preaching Jesus was to preach acceptable year of the Lord and the next verse comes out with his coming and and judgment and you see how he stopped right at that. Now I want to just stop there for a moment. When Jesus said, come now back to my text. When Jesus said, "For the days will come," when they say, "Blessed are the those that don't bear. Blessed are they that don't have children." He said, "Tday will come when they will say mountains fall on us and hills cover us." Right. &gt;&gt; Jesus was actually speaking of this very time &gt;&gt; that we're in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I feel that I need to announce to you and say to you that Satan is far more cunning than we want to give him credit for. &gt;&gt; He invades every area of life. And I want to announce also that God has pressurized you &gt;&gt; and given you insight so that you can see &gt;&gt; what you need to see and given you the power to resist what you need to resist. It's not enough for a minister to do so. It is you have to take that place. You have to take that place. Say this is not in the word of God. This is not what they do in the word of God. And we need to hold that standard very very high &gt;&gt; in the end time. I just have this. I'm going to close. I just read that in this day, the end time. I don't know what that means to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What would happen if you didn't have a church that believed that the word of God had become revealed? &gt;&gt; Where would you be? Says, "And he began calling his children." I want to read this roll call in heaven. If a man die, shall he live again? That's Job asked that. All the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come. Thou shalt call and I will answer. &gt;&gt; I have no question that he has called. Now I'm asking you as a congregation. I want you to ask yourself seriously, have I answered? &gt;&gt; Not just to say yes, I surrender all or sing a nice song. have I surrendered. He shall call and I will answer thee. Thou will have a desire to the work of thy hands. He said the great shepherd is calling his sheep by name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The creative voice of God is calling them forth from the dust or changing their atoms even though they had not fallen asleep. &gt;&gt; It is the rapture. It is the great marriage supper of the lamb and his bride. &gt;&gt; Listen church, young people, everyone here that's listening to my voice, we refer to a message all the time. And I'm closing. It's not a Sunday morning service. If I walked off this platform and never came here again, I would feel that these next few moments would have fulfilled my purpose in life. It is to tell you this message. God sent this vindicated voice to call you from the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; You're in dust. &gt;&gt; And that dust if time should go on is going to turn to a tablespoon of ashes. But that which is in you, that soul, God sent this message and this messenger uncompromisingly to let you know the state of the message and where it is and the present stage. And if you want to read uh the re read the present stage of my ministry, you should go home and read it. You'll find this sequence perfectly in place. And this call, this call is out. This message is actually calling out. &gt;&gt; And that is why that is why Satan is doing everything in his power. He wants to he wants to make the message and the ministers distraught or distressed or weary and the people weary. I hear this and I hear that. That's a place where you need to resist. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's when you need to resist. &gt;&gt; That's what you resist it. &gt;&gt; Don't give your ear to that &gt;&gt; any more than you'd give it to unclean living &gt;&gt; or something in the world. &gt;&gt; Movies don't attract us or entertain us or, you know, we we're not even interested in that. But something that sounds, you know, uh some some discussion about the message or whatever more that's if you need to hear it, we hear it from the messenger himself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's calling him forth from the dust of the earth. And I said to God this morning, it's the marriage supper of the lamb. I said, "You call, Lord. This is the call from the dust of the earth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I've taken too many funerals. I've seen life pass so swiftly. And I can tell you young men, young ladies, the best thing that you can do, the best thing you can do, &gt;&gt; the best thing that you can do is to give your life to the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand me when I say I had a grandson and he was pretty good at basketball. And I just said to him, and he's probably listening right now, I said, "There's no future on bouncing that ball. There's no future in it. I had a little piece of history and I I didn't bring it. I thought it wasn't necessary to read, but it was the from the State Department in the United States from the economic department of what $5 would buy and they went to 1913. Oh friends, I love you and I'd like to be able to say this and I'd like you to be able to hold on to it. said in 1913, they went back to 1913 because they said that was when the United States went off the gold standard and turned everything into the hands of the Federal Reserve, which I understand is just a private business and said then decided to run the country on printed money and that is how that economy they said on 1913 13. If you sent someone to the store with $5, you would not believe the list of things they could buy for $5. 10 lb of this and five lbs of chuck roast and so many steaks and on and on. So many pounds of rice and so many pounds of this and so many pounds of that. And at the end they said, "And then you you'll still have two cents left for some candy. $5 won't even buy you a a good mocha down in Starbucks. And what happened? And and and then and then you think that the prophet left that without saying something. No, he goes right to the gold standard. And I'm not even going to begin to speak to it, but he speaks. What is he doing? He's talking right at the roots of the economy. So why am I saying this to you? Don't put your faith in paper. &gt;&gt; You're looking at a man. I've had I've had right in front of me. Right in front of me. A shoe box. A shoe box full of money on its edge. Packed. Milk. This from your country. and the kids were playing with it and the people in that home had a sick child and that shoe box of money wouldn't even buy them some aspirins and furthermore they couldn't even find any because there was no medication. It's a modern city, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is place this economy people trusted in. They had universities. They had doctors. They had nurses. &gt;&gt; Don't trust in these things. &gt;&gt; I said, "Can I have some of this money?" They said, "Yeah." I took 30 billion dollars out of that shoe box. You couldn't even know it was gone. It had so many cir had so many zeros on it. And Milco says, "We've already taken four zeros off. My brother-in-law was in north in north Italy during the war and a woman was just begging for a loaf of bread, just a loaf of bread. And she's trying to get a man to give her a loaf of bread. And she had a whole bunch of money, millions of dollars in marks, German marks. Germany has come back up in the world, but not then. She had a whole wheelbarrow of this stuff wanting to buy a loaf of bread. And my brother-in-law, who was not converted then, he took a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket and just shook one out. One cigarette. Said, "Give her the bread." And I gave her a loaf of bread. We don't trust in vain riches. &gt;&gt; It's just paper. We don't trust this system. &gt;&gt; I've I've I've employed people and I I'm sitting upstairs and someone says to me, "You see that man sweeping the floor down there?" I said, "Yeah, he he's got some degrees in university. He's been going to university for 20ome years. He's got his master's degree in this or that or whatever more. He's so educated he can't get a job. said, "Well, well, that isn't my situation." It could be. &gt;&gt; That's the world we're in, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That happens to be the world we're in, friends. &gt;&gt; And the economy, the economics, don't trust it. &gt;&gt; It can just go sideways. &gt;&gt; You're looking at a person. I've paid I've paid myself since I was 15 years old. I've paid into the Canada Pension Plan. They took it right off my paycheck. I paid into it all of these years. And now because they can write, they can write whatever regulations they want to write. So they say, "Oh, you're still working. You still have an income from the from the church." So, we claw all that back and anything that you wouldn't even buy a room for you. Wouldn't buy you room and gas for your car. $900 or something. And they claw all that back. Not even their money. Never was their money. They've been using it for 60 years. They claw it all back. What are you going to do? Stomp your foot on the floor. What are you going to do? You say, "Oh, I have a 401k." Yeah. Well, I don't know what you have. Say, "Why are you preaching this way?" Because Satan has gotten into every government. Satan has got into every system. Don't forget it, friends. He is too cunning. He's got behind every religion. He's got behind all of these things. And for you to hear that he that he's using the internet or using this, I don't even talk about it. &gt;&gt; Of course he's using it. &gt;&gt; That's his kind of thing. &gt;&gt; You know, you see us up here in a suit and all the rest of it. I can tell you I and my wife I and my wife stood we've stood at the borders with armed guards trying to get across borders. There's people here who are sitting here in this service right now who had to hide. There's a man looking at me right now that told me I didn't see the sun for 15 months and 10 days. There's people here in this church educated. They got degrees from other countries and they come to this country and have to get re-educated and hopefully get a number and hopefully get certified and hopefully maybe they can teach, maybe they can be a nurse, maybe be something because the whole thing had collapsed. &gt;&gt; Right. Don't put your trust in your youth or your strengths or your beauty or your skills or paper or the government or anything else. You can only put say where will we put our confidence? You better just say like Peter when Jesus said do you want to leave me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you read when you read the present stage of my ministry, put yourself there because that's this ministry is &gt;&gt; that's the call. If I can say anything to you and I'm done. I do not believe that there's another voice coming &gt;&gt; to call the people from the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; There has to be a word with transforming power. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And if this isn't it, then we have certainly been deceived. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, if this is not it, but if it is it, it deserves everything we've got. It deserves the best of our life. It deserves everything. It deserves your finances. And we don't need it. We don't want, we're not asking for that, but deserves everything. &gt;&gt; It deserves your youth, young people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I had mine again, I would do it exactly the same thing. &gt;&gt; I would give I I would do whatever I could. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you get a car. &gt;&gt; I financed and bought a new car. And what I'm doing with it the first Sunday, I'm picking up kids for the Sunday school &gt;&gt; to drive them to Sunday school. And today I heard an announcement. you know who got place to keep some of these people so on. We had people in our house all the time. &gt;&gt; God bless the Hoffman family. I talked to sister Hoffman. I said I heard somebody else can I said can I come to your house and live there? She said if just we have to find a bed. Can you take one more person? Well just as long as we have a bed. You get a mattress room for one more. and I went and picked up kids. Why am I telling you this? The gospel comes this way. &gt;&gt; This is It's on the shoulders of the gospel. It's on the shoulders of the working people. &gt;&gt; It's not on the shoulders of the rich. It's on the shoulders of the poor. &gt;&gt; I know I preached you out, but I'm going to preach it just till I'm getting it home. &gt;&gt; This is the word. And you you have to decide something probably this morning, not just a sermon. say, "Oh, Brother Tom or Brother John or Brother Tim or Brother Ed, somebody's preaching." That's not the point. Is this the message or isn't it the message? Is this the call? Is this the voice of God? &gt;&gt; Is this what it says? What Apostle Paul says &gt;&gt; who's in prison say, "You want to listen to a guy that's in prison that can't even have a following and has one coat? Bring my coat. It's cold." &gt;&gt; Have you been influenced? Are you influenced sufficiently? say, "Well, it's in it's in it's in the Bible." No, no. The man's in jail. &gt;&gt; The man hasn't even got a a congregation. &gt;&gt; The man hasn't got any money. &gt;&gt; He's just got a coat. All my friends have left me. &gt;&gt; All the counselors, all the big people have left. &gt;&gt; You want to be part of that church? You want to be part of Jesus church? &gt;&gt; Jesus church whose secretary just committed suicide. Is that the church you want to be? You got to have a revelation of who that man was. &gt;&gt; Nobody else would agree with you. Said this is the prince of peace. The prince of peace hanging on that cross. What are you telling me? Ah, you're wild. Let me be wild then. You're a fanatic. Let me be a fanatic. You want to listen to this man? Did you read the internet lately? No, I haven't read the internet lately. I've read the Bible lately and I can tell you one thing, this message has revealed Jesus Christ in this Bible. And if time will go on, that change the course of history has been changed by a man of God, &gt;&gt; a prophet of God has actually changed it. Who introduced a serpent seedl? &gt;&gt; So, oh, we heard that long time ago. I even heard that Catholics used to used to believe something along that line years ago. Rabbi Richmond told me that some of the mystics of the of the Cabala or the Jewish Orthodox Jewish faith, they believe that. And I said, "Well, they believe that that Cain was a product." No, he said they haven't gone that far. You got to have the twins. One man who used to profess this message met me down on the on the White Rock Prominad and says, "Oh, I've been I've been wanting to see you." I said, "Is that right?" I said, "I" He said, "You know what?" He said, "If I could have you for a little while, I could I I'd like to tell you that that serpent seed is not of not of God." I said, "Is that right?" I said, "I can." He said, "I can prove it." I said, "Is that right?" I said, 'Well, ju just have a look down this prominad and tell me that this is all all God's children. Have a look at all this nakedness and tell me that I said, "Come on." &gt;&gt; And he was without words. He's without words. The truth was silence on friends. You got to be convinced of this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say you are enthused about this. I say I'm enthused about it. &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing that God's so privileged you &gt;&gt; to believe this word and to be able to say yes. &gt;&gt; This is my life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And Satan doesn't want you to make that commitment because he's a he's afraid of the influence and the effect that you'll have. I said go out from this place and have a powerful effect. Don't just be carried along on a wave of, you know, uh of non-committal. be committed. &gt;&gt; Said to all you people on the balcony, wherever you are in this building, we need men and women committed. &gt;&gt; I find those in the scripture, we're committed. And I want to rub shoulders with them on the other side and feel that I've been true to my age. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Pressure eyes for this age. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You may not feel pressurized for anything. You need to be at this altar. Say, "God, I give myself to you. &gt;&gt; I'm pressurized for this age and I'll stand true to it." &gt;&gt; Lord God, &gt;&gt; dear heavenly father, &gt;&gt; we've done what we felt you would have us to do, &gt;&gt; to declare your truth and declare your word. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And you will not stand behind anything that's not truth. I pray, Father, you'll take the fervor of spirit and baptize everyone with a fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost. I pray the same spirit that brought the word will live the word out through these individuals. I pray you'll bless these ministers that are here, oh God, bless them that have given themselves, given their lives, given their homes, given their families. Bless them, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. Bless this congregation. I pray, oh God, that the fire of God will burn until it's attracted the people and those that are your calling. May they come. May they come and see what is happening. I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll receive us. Forgive us for anything that we have said or done wrong. Now you we be washed by the only only blood, the only sacrifice, the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Thank you, Father, for the people that so support your word, your work. I pray you'll bless the ministers of the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; around the world. Oh God, many of them are in severe difficulties. I pray, Father, you'll see our hearts. We desire that they will be provided for, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. We're not here to serve with lip service. We're here to be active &gt;&gt; in your kingdom, oh God, &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to stand please, with me, Brother Nathan, if you'd come, please, I want to sing that song. I believe it was written by uh what's his name? Not Morai Ham, but Gypsy Smith, I believe, wrote this song. Like you to sing it with me. Jesus revealed in me. Sing it as you mean it. Just wait till we get it out, please. 869, [Music] making his glory shine. Oh, to reflect his grace, causing the world to see [Music] that will shall Jesus redee. &gt;&gt; Now, just before you sing these, I felt led to have this song. And I'm asking you as an individual individually you'll say say every one of these words from the depth of your heart and say this is the direction for me here Lord I bring my heart my love my strength my will [Music] cleanse in every heart with all my spirit filled [Music] his grace causing the world to see love and Oh, till the power shall go Jesus reveal in me. Every word now life is no longer [Music] to me. [Music] I God [Music] reflect his graing [Music] the world to sing. The man will sh Jesus in me. Tri is mine. Now Jesus reigns with he joing [Music] [Music] the world to See love that will grow. [Music] Jesus reveal in me. &gt;&gt; In a few moments, we're going to pray. I'd like to give you a secret about prayer. It's not a big complicated thing. You don't have to come up and pound the altar. Jesus is our pattern. &gt;&gt; And Jesus would ask, "Believe us thou this?" "Yay, Lord." And he gave them what they asked. That simple. Brother Brandon would have people standing here and I've watched it and he'd say, "Do you believe, sister? Do you believe, brother?" And a simple answer, "Yes, I do. God bless you." and would give them what they asked for. It's just that simple. What is that desire you have? Don't let the devil creep into this sanctuary and make you think that you've got to go through some antics and you have to reach up and you have to get some you've got to fast for days and you've got to do something. You don't have to do anything. Believe it. &gt;&gt; Just believe it. &gt;&gt; That's all. Believe it. that you're the one, oh God. &gt;&gt; You have to energize me. &gt;&gt; You have to give me the resisting power. You have to give me the Holy Ghost. I just believe it. Just simple. I've tried everything. He said, don't try to press yourself. You can't press yourself. You can't attain it. You've tried all of that. Just say, I believe it, oh boy, all this life is no longer mine. I give it all to you. If you can mean that, he'll come right now and do that. And we're going to pray. Life is no longer mine. Once more you all toe [Music] until I face the sea. [Music] to reflect his praise. Bring the world to see love that will [Music] shall go. Jesus reveal me. We will bow our heads in prayer. I'll ask you if you have a desire in your heart or a need. Perhaps you'd like to raise your hand to him. I'm not looking. Don't want anyone else to look between you and God. You see, Lord Jesus, the preacher just said, "All I have to say is I believe it. I'm coming to you now. I've tried all kinds of things. I've made promises. I failed. But now I come, I just say, I believe it. I believe in you. I believe that this is your word. I believe that this is your voice that you've sent. And now, Father, with the response from the people, whatever it may be, you know the heart. You know this, those that need it. You know what is what we have need of. And oh God, I have many needs. and the congregation perhaps have many needs, varied needs from different directions. They got different desires they're praying about. But I pray that none of those desires will have anything to do with this world. But it will have to do to position themselves for the world that is coming for the world that they've even been called into. And you have sent a voice, Lord. Let me say it plainly. You sent a voice to call the people out of the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; This world. This world. Oh God, your voice is calling them out of this world into another place into a heavenly place. Heavenly place they can even dwell in heavenly places in Christ Jesus at this very moment. Take them. I pray that today. May there be a sacredness upon this day. May people be have the somnity of the Holy Spirit as they consider oh God what it is that you desire for them. I pray father that as we dedicate ourselves to you, we dedicate ourselves body, spirit and soul, every w we dedicate ourselves to you as a congregation. And now we thank you father. I thank you Jesus for experiencing hell on my behalf so that I would not have to go. &gt;&gt; I thank you Lord Jesus. I thank you, Lord Jesus. How true it was when you told the women, "Don't lament for me. Pray for yourself and for your children, oh God. And here we are, children of this day, but we're children of this message. We're children of this word. We're children who's been called by the voice of God. We're children, oh God, that have been elected and dedicated for the rapture of the church, for the catching away. We do not know how. We do not know when, oh God, but we say with all that is within us. Here I am, oh God. I'm here to be your testimony. I'm here to be your witness. I'm here to stand with Apostle Paul. I'm here to stand with the prophets of old. I'm here to stand with the messenger of this age. Oh God, I'm here to stand and say amen to that which has been preached. Father, here we are. We pray that you'll accept us and receive us in the name of Jesus Christ. We call it done and finished in Jesus name. We thank you Lord. Oh we thank you Lord Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh we thank you Lord. Hallelujah. God bless you. I'm sorry for keeping you as long as I have. I realize the time slipped along but something for you to think about. Something for you to give yourself to. You have heard the voice of God. That's what you've heard down in your soul. &gt;&gt; I say give yourself unreservedly to it &gt;&gt; and make it a dedicated so you don't have to do it over and over again. You don't have to do it over again. &gt;&gt; I can tell you friends, I can tell you do it once and it's done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. None of this wishy-washy stuff. You just do it. You set your sights on the prize of the high calling and go in that direction. God bless you all. You're dismissed in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Glory [Music] to God.
