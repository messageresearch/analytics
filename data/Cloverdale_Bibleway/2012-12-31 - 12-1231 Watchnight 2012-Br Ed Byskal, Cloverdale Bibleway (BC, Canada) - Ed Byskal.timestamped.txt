[5:48] Can we all stand this [music] evening?
[5:53] Such an honor to [music] serve a king as
[5:57] great a king as we serve. Such an honor
[6:01] [music]
[6:02] to know Jesus Christ
[6:05] in an age when it's been prophesied
[6:08] they'd be blind,
[6:10] miserable, [music]
[6:11] and wretched. And here we stand this
[6:14] evening, I trust, clothed in our right
[6:16] minds. [music] Amen. We can worship
[6:19] like no other people on earth can
[6:21] worship. We serve a [music] risen
[6:23] savior.
[6:25] Amen. God bless you this evening. It's
[6:27] wonderful to be gathered with you
[6:29] tonight. [music] It's good to see so
[6:30] many friends
[6:32] coming from the Federal Way, Tacoma,
[6:36] Seattle area,
[6:38] from Chilowak to Victoria.
[6:41] Praise God. [music] I wouldn't even
[6:43] forget about Grand Prairie, Alberta.
[6:47] Praise the Lord.
[6:49] Eagles flying in this evening. Amen.
[6:53] [music] God bless you each and everyone.
[6:55] It's Brother Ken Andes. Did I miss him?
[6:58] Brother Ken, [music]
[7:02] I didn't see him. Brother Joseph [music]
[7:04] Solomon, why don't you come down and
[7:06] open the service in a word of prayer
[7:08] this evening? [music] So good to have
[7:10] you here with us.
[7:12] Amen. [music] Brother Victor Adamora,
[7:14] God bless you.
[7:17] Amen.
[7:19] Isn't [music] it wonderful be around one
[7:20] another, be able to spend the evening
[7:22] together? We've got a list of specials,
[7:25] so I trust that we'll be able to get in
[7:27] as many as we can.
[7:30] If we do miss you, we want to apologize
[7:31] [music] upfront. It's not because we
[7:33] didn't want you to sing. It's the time
[7:35] restraints that we may [music] be under,
[7:37] but we will absolutely enjoy a wonderful
[7:39] evening together.
[7:42] Um, we do want to welcome a co-orker of
[7:45] Sister Margaret. I believe it's Karm and
[7:49] her family and Amen and her family.
[7:51] [music]
[7:52] We right here, why don't we give them a
[7:54] hand this evening? Amen.
[8:01] [music]
[8:02] And those are that are joining with us
[8:04] throughout the evening on the telephone
[8:05] and on the internet hookup, we certainly
[8:08] want to greet you this evening and say
[8:09] God bless you. Welcome to the service
[8:12] tonight, Brother Joseph Solomon. Why
[8:15] [music] don't you come open the service
[8:16] in a word of prayer?
[8:24] Shall we pray together?
[8:26] Our dear heavenly father,
[8:29] we're so grateful
[8:31] and thankful to you
[8:35] &gt;&gt; that we can gather tonight, Lord Jesus,
[8:39] &gt;&gt; looking back through the years
[8:42] with testimonies, Lord, within us
[8:46] with many things [music]
[8:49] to praise you about.
[8:52] We can look back at junctions where you
[8:55] have spoken to us,
[8:57] where you have picked us up,
[9:01] where you have opened doors for us,
[9:04] where you have fought battles for us,
[9:07] Lord Jesus.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:09] &gt;&gt; Junctions where we knew that [music]
[9:13] something supernatural happened. And if
[9:16] it had not been Jesus, [music]
[9:18] where would we be today?
[9:21] We're here to thank you tonight, Lord.
[9:25] We're here to give our hearts to you,
[9:26] Lord.
[9:28] We're here to surrender all, Lord Jesus.
[9:32] You've given us clarity of vision to
[9:34] understand.
[9:37] That is not by our strength. [music]
[9:39] Many of us would have gone away, would
[9:41] have given up under great pressure.
[9:44] [music]
[9:45] &gt;&gt; But Lord, you never let us go.
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're the one
[9:50] that is holding us and
[9:52] &gt;&gt; keeping us through, Lord. [music]
[9:54] &gt;&gt; Father, we want to thank you tonight,
[9:58] &gt;&gt; the living God among us
[10:01] &gt;&gt; that you desire so much to show yourself
[10:05] in your people. [music]
[10:07] And oh, how blessed we are that we are
[10:10] the ones that you have chosen, [music]
[10:12] &gt;&gt; part of your bride.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; But we can say so by faith.
[10:17] Lord, we thank you for a marvelous thing
[10:20] you are doing among us and we have the
[10:23] life to show and to testify that it is
[10:26] true. Your word being made so clear to
[10:29] us, Father.
[10:32] Lord,
[10:33] we pray that you will
[10:36] show forth yourself amongst us tonight.
[10:39] [music]
[10:40] Our worship, Lord, we bring it to you,
[10:43] Lord Jesus. Identify yourself amongst
[10:46] us, Lord Jesus. And all our believing
[10:49] friends, Lord, some on the internet,
[10:52] Lord Jesus, and [music] many on the
[10:53] hookups, Lord. The world over Father,
[10:57] all our hearts, our praise, our songs
[11:01] being directed to you, the living God.
[11:04] [music]
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Come, Father, and take control. Come and
[11:08] bless us. Come and make yourself more
[11:11] known to us, Lord Jesus, through your
[11:13] word. We commit the service to you that
[11:17] you will come and Lord let it be a
[11:19] blessing to our hearts [music] the new
[11:21] year coming in father
[11:25] we thank you so much [music]
[11:27] you've done so much for us and
[11:30] we just pray in simple words that thank
[11:34] you Jesus may you continue with us and
[11:37] have your own way among us tonight
[11:41] those that were not able to [music] be
[11:43] here Lord Lord be with them and
[11:45] &gt;&gt; touch them. I pray
[11:48] give them what you are going to give us
[11:51] because you are the same God ever
[11:54] present.
[11:56] Distance is no problem to you. [music]
[11:58] May you speak to them wherever they are.
[12:02] And we'll give you the honor and praise.
[12:05] Thank you father. Commit the service to
[12:08] you in Jesus name. Amen.
[12:12] [music]
[12:15] Why don't you greet somebody standing

[12:31] Amen. Amen. Why don't you have your
[12:34] seats? Our pastor is going to be coming
[12:35] in just a moment, but I thought we would
[12:37] sing a song [music] that's stuck with us
[12:40] throughout the year. His love has been
[12:42] so amazing.
[12:44] It amazes me that he could [music] love
[12:46] a sinner such as I. That we could be
[12:49] part of one family.
[12:52] [music] I'm [singing]
[12:56] that you love me. [music]
[13:01] I live
[13:05] out [singing] here.

[13:52] love. I bow [music] for you.

[14:00] [music] want
[14:02] all my
[14:11] &gt;&gt; [music]
[14:13] &gt;&gt; And that's who we believe.
[14:16] That's what's really amazing.

[14:34] greetings and we want to give them and
[14:35] get out of the way right away because
[14:37] we've got a lot of the different groups
[14:39] that are going to be singing. And uh as
[14:42] I said to someone in an email today, I
[14:44] said they're going to be singing. We're
[14:46] going to have a group in Chinese and
[14:48] another group in Russian and a group in
[14:51] Congalles and a group and after I named

[15:02] Rodwald's church. Uh brother um brother
[15:07] Marcus Becker who ministers there and
[15:09] also was the interpreter when I was

[15:28] pleasure and a great privilege to meet
[15:29] you and to work with you in 2012 and I
[15:32] trust to meet you again in 2013.
[15:35] Also greetings and uh these are special
[15:38] greetings. People have taken time to uh
[15:41] not only uh think about you but they
[15:44] wanted to write. They wanted it
[15:46] expressed. So the saints in Switzerland
[15:49] all and you've met many of them. So they
[15:52] want to be remembered to you. Brother
[15:54] Benny Perry from South Carolina called
[15:56] today. Pastor Benny Perry and he wanted
[15:59] uh the church to be greeted so that you
[16:03] also can uh we can say God bless you
[16:06] because many of them will be listening
[16:08] on the archives as well. Uh, brother
[16:11] Richard Dioa called the other day and he
[16:14] wanted to be remembered from the church
[16:17] in the Congo and some of you have been
[16:19] in that church and attended it. Uh, we
[16:22] have been there and what a wonderful
[16:24] congregation. Uh, a growing
[16:26] congregation. I don't know how many they
[16:28] have now. Probably 10,000 or more
[16:31] already. Now, uh, brother Vladisovv
[16:36] Vladislov
[16:38] Jacques, he's from Czech Republic and he
[16:41] gave his greetings the other day on
[16:43] Sunday. He gave greetings to the church
[16:46] in person, but uh he wanted to be
[16:49] remembered to you. And he has also uh
[16:52] emailed back right away and said, "We we
[16:55] streamed the meeting and heard the
[16:58] greetings and they were so happy that uh
[17:00] that they could be a part of the
[17:01] service." We had a lovely testimony and
[17:04] I don't have the pictures to show you
[17:07] tonight, but they sent also the pictures
[17:10] from brother [clears throat] Radu Lutus.
[17:13] uh in Romania and he's been working with
[17:17] the uh
[17:19] with a lot of the gypsy people and uh
[17:21] they had a whole line of them alongside
[17:23] of a pool and they were just going in to
[17:26] be baptized and I think I counted 12 or
[17:28] more uh of them ready to be baptized and
[17:32] he he felt directed to go to a certain
[17:34] town. So he just sent that to a number
[17:37] of the ministers here and wanted us to
[17:41] uh rejoice with them about that also
[17:44] from uh brother Yano and sister Anna
[17:48] Thomas and uh children from Serbia. He's
[17:52] a pastor in Serbia and he sent special
[17:55] greetings to us. and John 1:16. And of
[17:58] his fullness have have all we received
[18:03] and grace for grace. May the Lord Jesus
[18:06] bless you and your family and also the
[18:09] saints and keep you in this new year of
[18:13] 2013.
[18:14] And from Uganda, uh, Brother Basabosi,
[18:19] and they may be streaming right now, but
[18:21] we want to be sure and let them know
[18:24] that we have a good connection with
[18:25] them. and many of the saints here have a
[18:27] connection with him. He put out started
[18:29] in university with just a youth letter
[18:33] and it has grown till he's uh simply
[18:36] been is known almost all over the world
[18:39] right now. So and and a a group of our
[18:43] senior young people are going to be
[18:45] going over there I understand by God's
[18:48] grace and be a part of his wedding. He's
[18:51] going to get married.
[18:53] So we wish him the best.
[18:56] Amen.

[19:04] [clears throat] in London, Ontario, and
[19:06] he sent us special greetings as well.
[19:09] Uh,
[19:14] and I think that about does it. Brother
[19:18] Tom received some as well. But anyway, I
[19:20] just wanted to give you those greetings
[19:22] because I think we have an obligation to
[19:24] give those greetings when they've been
[19:26] sent specifically greet the saints for
[19:28] us. And so I don't take it like pray for
[19:31] us, you know, and they don't really mean
[19:33] it. We we mean it. We say pray for us,
[19:35] you pray for us. If they say greet greet
[19:38] the saints, well then I'm here greeting
[19:40] the saints. God bless you all. Can we
[19:42] say God bless you?
[19:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's for everyone that'll be on
[19:47] the streaming. Amen. God bless you,
[19:49] brother.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we have the uh senior
[19:54] choir and uh brother Ryan and sister
[19:57] Shana are going to sing together healer
[19:59] of my heart,
[20:01] young people's choir. I have to be quite
[20:03] specific this evening. So, if brother
[20:04] Ryan corrects me, it's totally fine
[20:08] tonight. Okay.
[20:12] All right. So, let's have the young
[20:13] people's choir.
[20:16] Perfect.
[20:17] And uh let's sing together as they're
[20:19] coming. Lord, I lift your name on high.

[20:24] Amen.
[20:36] Lord, [music] I lift your name on high.
[20:43] Lord, I love to sing [music] your
[20:46] praises.
[20:49] [music] I'm so glad you're in my life.
[20:56] [music] I'm so glad you came to save us.
[21:02] You came [music and singing] from heaven
[21:05] to earth to show the way. From the earth
[21:11] to the cross. [music]
[21:13] My daddy.
[21:16] From the cross to the grave. From
[21:19] [music] the grave to the sky. Lord I
[21:23] lift your name on [music]
[21:25] high.
[21:28] See
[21:36] you the microphone. Matthew,
[21:40] God bless you this evening. Are we on?
[21:42] Wonderful. Uh, Brother Tom had mentioned
[21:45] at a watch night last year how he
[21:48] appreciated having songs that meant
[21:51] something throughout the year. And this
[21:52] was a song that the Lord gave me before
[21:54] camp that I've received probably about
[21:56] as many comments on as any song I've
[21:59] written. And um I've been blessed by it.
[22:02] So I just trust that uh we can all
[22:04] testify that he truly is the healer of
[22:07] our hearts. Not just our physical
[22:09] healer, but our spiritual healer. Amen.
[22:11] So maybe brother, could we have the word
[22:13] the chorus maybe on the screen and the
[22:15] small screen as well for the choir so
[22:17] that those who wish to join us can and
[22:19] we just trust it'll be a blessing to
[22:20] you. Amen.

[31:58] My heart is [singing] dark and dirty.

[32:46] May I press onward [singing]
[32:48] to know you Lord.
[32:57] [music]
[33:02] May our time [music] be sweeter.

[33:56] more worthy.

[34:03] May I stand longer. [singing]
[34:06] May I press onward to know you, Lord.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[34:18] &gt;&gt; So clothe

[34:46] more worthy. [singing]

[37:09] happy to have you here this evening.
[37:11] Amen. Would [applause]
[37:17] it be all right if you'd come and sing
[37:18] for us tonight? Maybe just after the
[37:20] brothers are done. That'd be real
[37:22] wonderful. We appreciate that.

[42:07] land.
[42:16] [applause]
[42:58] Praise the Lord.
[43:00] Just a little song we used to sing way
[43:02] back. Uh a song that inspires us and
[43:05] reminds us of where we're going. The
[43:08] words are really important and we
[43:09] thought it good to bring it to you. We
[43:11] hope it's a blessing to you. Amen.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Appointment in heaven.
[43:21] [music] No way in a sorrow or pain.
[43:26] [music]
[43:27] No hearts that are [singing] bleeding
[43:31] and broken.
[43:34] No song with a minor refrain.
[43:40] The clouds of our earthly horizon
[43:46] will never appear in the sky.
[43:52] [music]
[43:53] For all will [singing] be sunshine and
[43:56] gladness
[43:59] [music] with never a so nor
[44:04] [music]
[44:06] bound for that beautiful city.
[44:11] [music] My Lord has prepared for his
[44:15] song
[44:17] where all the redeemed of
[44:20] [music and singing] all ages
[44:24] sing glory around the white throne.
[44:29] [music] Sometimes I grow homesick for
[44:33] heaven.
[44:36] And the glorious high there shall
[44:39] behold.
[44:41] [music]
[44:42] What a joy that will be [singing] when
[44:45] my Savior I see [music] in that
[44:49] beautiful city of God
[44:54] [music]
[44:54] will never pay rent for our mansion.
[45:00] The taxes will [singing] never come due.
[45:05] Our
[45:07] garments will never grow threadbear,
[45:10] [music]
[45:12] but always be fedless. And you
[45:18] will never be hungry nor thirsty,
[45:23] [music]
[45:24] nor languish in poverty. there
[45:30] [music]
[45:30] for all the rich bounties of heaven.
[45:35] [music]
[45:36] His sanctified children will share.
[45:42] [music] There'll never be grape on the
[45:46] door. No,
[45:48] [music] no funeral
[45:51] in the sky.
[45:54] No graves on the hillsides [music] of
[45:58] glory.
[46:00] For there we shall never more die.
[46:06] The [music] old will be there forever.
[46:11] [music]
[46:12] Transformed in the moment of time.
[46:18] Immortal will stand in his [music]
[46:21] likeness.
[46:24] the stars and the sun to outshine.
[46:30] I'm [music] bound for that beautiful
[46:33] city.
[46:35] [music] My Lord has prepared for his
[46:39] song
[46:41] where all the redeemed of all ages
[46:47] sing glory around the white throne.
[46:53] Sometimes I grow homesick for [music]
[46:56] heaven
[46:59] and the glories I [music] there shall
[47:02] behold.
[47:05] What a joy that [music] will be
[47:07] [singing] when my savior I see in that
[47:12] beautiful city of
[47:17] &gt;&gt; praise God. Thank you. Thank you.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Is that what you're
[47:25] looking forward to? Amen. Brother Kyle,
[47:28] why don't you come this evening? Brother
[47:30] Kyle's going to speak to us for a couple
[47:32] of moments what the Lord has laid on his
[47:34] heart. Amen. God bless you this evening,
[47:36] Brother Kyle.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; God bless everybody. Amen. Didn't that
[47:42] sound good?
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it look so dapper and fine? Oh
[47:45] my man, sons of God are royal. Amen. And
[47:49] so I'm so thankful to be here. Um I was
[47:52] just thinking as I was sitting there,
[47:53] you know, I think we're realizing more
[47:55] and more
[47:57] uh this is my eighth watch night and um
[48:00] I think we're realizing more and more
[48:01] how much of a miracle it is to serve God
[48:03] in the light of this hour.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if you've been
[48:06] finding that lately, but um I sure have.
[48:09] And I just want to share a little
[48:10] thought if the brothers can put up my
[48:12] slides there. Would that be wonderful?
[48:15] So here we are. Got it, Aaron?
[48:18] Wonderful.
[48:19] So man, here we are at watch night and
[48:21] I've been thinking about, you know,
[48:24] 2012 has just gone, 2013 is coming and
[48:28] um whether 2012 was a good year or a bad
[48:31] year, it just depends on your
[48:32] perspective
[48:33] &gt;&gt; and whether you're excited for 2013 or
[48:36] not just depends on your perspective.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's just
[48:43] go for it a bit. So perspective, what is
[48:44] that? It's a particular attitude
[48:48] toward or way of regarding something or
[48:51] a point of view. So if in 2012 you spent
[48:55] a whole lot of time uh researching Mayan
[48:57] prophecies and the end of the world in
[48:59] 2012. Uh 2012 was probably a very
[49:01] embarrassing year for you. You probably
[49:04] wasted a lot of time and energy and uh
[49:07] you I don't know what you're thinking
[49:08] about 2013, but you should start reading
[49:10] your Bible.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz there's a three and a half
[49:12] year tribulation first. So, you should
[49:15] know these things. But if you're here,
[49:16] you're in a good spot. Amen. If you
[49:19] really like the NHL, you're probably
[49:21] really sad. So far, there's been no
[49:23] games and so forth, but uh it doesn't
[49:26] bother me at all. Amen. Let the season
[49:28] go. Let NFL go. Let NBA go. Amen. Word
[49:32] perspective.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh if you're really into
[49:37] economics and the government and so
[49:39] forth, the fiscal cliff uh probably
[49:41] makes you a little bit worried and a
[49:42] little bit nervous and so forth. But if
[49:44] you have a Bible perspective, you know,
[49:46] things have to go that way. Amen. You
[49:48] know, the beasts and the powers have to
[49:50] bring things to a one world government
[49:52] and do all kinds of things with the
[49:53] economy. So, Amen. Don't worry about
[49:55] that. The Bible does not say, "He that
[49:58] enjoys himself to the end shall be
[49:59] saved." Right? He that endures to the
[50:03] end shall be saved. Um, you know,
[50:05] thinking of living a snowbird existence
[50:07] is so 2005, right? We don't we're not
[50:10] just trying to live our life to have big
[50:12] houses and live here in the summer and
[50:14] go somewhere warm in the winter and
[50:16] really enjoy oursel in life. We're here
[50:18] to be rugged, to be rugged Christians.
[50:21] So, we just need to have, as in German,
[50:23] they would say, a bibble perspective.
[50:26] Amen. Not a zeitgeist perspective, which
[50:28] means the the spirit of the world. Amen.
[50:31] Sister Gabusi, that's for you. A Bible
[50:33] perspective.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm half German and half English
[50:36] like Blimin Dodd. So, here is a picture
[50:39] of Sister Marilyn Chabernovs. I took
[50:42] this without her permission.
[50:46] So, I was thinking of Sister Marilyn.
[50:48] This is uh 216th Street. I drive down it
[50:50] many times, but she has kind of an
[50:52] artist perspective, right? and she has
[50:54] kind of a a naturalist perspective. So
[50:57] if you see in this picture here, you
[50:59] notice up here there's some crows and
[51:02] down here there's some uh rotten corn.
[51:05] So she calls this the corn roast on
[51:06] 216th, right? So she's noticing these
[51:09] there's there's these subplots
[51:12] &gt;&gt; happening on this road, right? She she's
[51:14] noticing these things. She has an artist
[51:16] perspective to catch a different layer
[51:18] &gt;&gt; that other people aren't catching. And
[51:21] if you were a hydro uh power line guy
[51:23] like brother Sterling or brother uh Sam
[51:25] Ray, you might think, man, these these
[51:27] branches over here look look pretty
[51:28] close to those power lines. I mean, if
[51:30] it if it gets windy, I better call my
[51:32] boss and get these done cuz this is a
[51:33] real street, right? So, he would have
[51:35] like a hydro person's uh perspective and
[51:38] and way at looking at things. Do you
[51:40] understand what I mean?
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, we want to have a word of
[51:44] God perspective.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to be narrow-minded.
[51:47] Brother Ram says that in the times of
[51:49] Jesus, the Pharisees and Sadducees were
[51:51] so narrow. If you'd put a pencil in
[51:54] front of their eyes, it would blind
[51:55] them. That's that's how narrow they
[51:57] were. And that's how come they weren't
[51:59] able to recognize Jesus. And we don't
[52:00] want to be like that. Amen. We don't
[52:02] want to. I I find uh myself and other
[52:04] people in the message, I find we get so
[52:06] narrow-minded. We think that God is only
[52:09] speaking to us when the preacher
[52:11] mentions the same quotes we've been
[52:12] reading and the same scriptures we've
[52:14] been reading. And if that's not
[52:16] happening, we think God's not speaking
[52:18] to us. Right? That's very narrow. Amen.
[52:20] God wants to speak to us wherever we go.
[52:22] And he wants us to be open and to be
[52:24] willing for him to deal with our heart.
[52:26] And so, we need to have a a more uh
[52:29] wider word perspective. Amen. It's good
[52:32] for believers to uh read the Bible.
[52:34] Amen. Read the message and so forth.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so, I'm going to
[52:37] take a little bit of a a sharp corner
[52:39] here if you don't mind, but it's going
[52:40] to be purposeful.
[52:42] So, here is the little church that we
[52:44] rent in Victoria. Amen. Pretty nice,
[52:46] right?
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's been there so far?
[52:50] That's quite a lot, right? Praise the
[52:51] Lord. That's quite a lot of people. And
[52:53] so, uh that's at 500 Admiral's Road uh
[52:56] in Victoria there. Just wanted to show
[52:58] that. Then here is a picture of uh
[53:00] Brother Raphael. He sang up here with
[53:02] Brother Ansam. He's a song leader there.
[53:04] He just got married to Sister Alen right
[53:06] here in the summertime. You remember
[53:07] that? And there she is right there.
[53:08] There's his wife. Praise the Lord.
[53:11] They're smiling and so happy and doing
[53:13] good. Amen. And here's a picture of uh
[53:15] the group that's also with some friends
[53:17] and families when brother John Andy's
[53:19] was there. It's a big group, right?
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's been over
[53:24] two years now the services have been
[53:25] going.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; That's a miracle.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every Sunday now at 2:00 there's
[53:31] service in Victoria.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; There's a lighthouse in Victoria.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I try and go once a month or
[53:36] one of these brothers come or brother
[53:38] Alex he's back there he'll take services
[53:40] on Sunday brother an S and souls are
[53:42] coming
[53:43] &gt;&gt; there's been five souls baptized in two
[53:45] years
[53:46] &gt;&gt; amen
[53:46] &gt;&gt; and and and three are doing really
[53:48] really good that's wonderful
[53:50] &gt;&gt; amen just think in two years does
[53:52] anybody know of another church in Canada
[53:55] that started in a fresh city not from a
[53:59] split does anybody know one
[54:02] &gt;&gt; nobody
[54:04] so what's your perspect perspective of
[54:05] what this is.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; It's a miracle.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; It's a miracle of God.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; In Acts 19, Paul passed through the
[54:12] upper coast of Ephesus. He found 12
[54:14] people.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at this. Amen. They're not
[54:18] all all of them there aren't serving in
[54:20] the fullness, but they're coming.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; They're coming regularly.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's about 15 uh solid message
[54:27] believers there.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a miracle.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Perspective. Praise God. And I
[54:32] love the believers there. I love them.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; I love them. They're humble and they
[54:35] witness. Every time I go there, there's
[54:37] someone new. Brother Guay, can you stand
[54:39] up? Amen. He's been coming for about six
[54:42] weeks. He's going to stay overnight at
[54:43] my house tonight. Amen. Let's give him a
[54:44] round of applause. [applause]
[54:50] Amen. So, if anybody is from Thailand or
[54:53] Burma. Amen. That's where he's from. You
[54:54] can talk to him a little bit. But Tom
[54:56] met him, remember?
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Isn't that wonderful?
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Perspective.
[55:01] So, here's the Tom Ray. I love it. I
[55:04] love it. But Tom Ray came. Amen. And uh
[55:07] if you look right here, you can't really
[55:08] see too good. There's Abigail and the
[55:10] kids. There's Joel. Here's Michael
[55:12] singing a special. Sister Joanne Ray on
[55:14] piano. It was the first time she ever
[55:16] had to play piano to how Oh God, how
[55:18] great thou Arth
[55:21] [clears throat]
[55:23] Ghana style. Amen. I love it. Amen.
[55:26] Everyone's different. I'm I'm rigid in
[55:27] German and English, but I love it. Amen.
[55:30] And so we had a good time. I was
[55:32] thinking about Tom and his family. Uh
[55:34] they could be a traveling evangelical
[55:35] family, you know. Mike could song lead,
[55:38] Sam could deacon, Joel could be the guy
[55:40] in the pew.
[55:42] Amen. The the girls could do the Sunday
[55:45] school. So just keep that in prayer.
[55:48] Amen. So that was December 16th. Uh so I
[55:52] I was thinking there sorry I was
[55:54] thinking about how um we without knowing
[55:59] it we kind of make God very historical
[56:01] without knowing it. We we do you know we
[56:03] kind of think of things like this. Oh
[56:04] wow. There's the journeys of St. Paul
[56:06] and you know St. Paul went here and St.
[56:09] Paul went there and St. Paul did this
[56:11] right? We we have these maps in our
[56:13] Bibles and we know these things and so
[56:14] forth. But what about this here?
[56:17] The the journeys of St. Thomas Aay.
[56:20] Amen.
[56:23] Was home.
[56:25] Amen. Right. Started in uh Cloverdale
[56:27] here and took the ferry and boat. Right.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Just like what's what's the difference?
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Right. Was Paul a saint?
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Is Blam a saint?
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; His middle name is Arthur. 107th Journey
[56:43] Blom. Amen. I don't know what it but
[56:46] that's just 10 seven is a good number.
[56:47] So, I was just thinking, you know,
[56:49] what's our perspective of things? What's
[56:51] our perspective of who we are? Right?
[56:54] The Bible says, "It's God who workketh
[56:55] in you to do of his good pleasure."
[56:57] Philippians 2:13. So, you know, when I'm
[57:00] saying things about Victoria, it's not
[57:02] cuz we're tooting horns. You know what I
[57:03] mean? It's God.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; It's God who workketh in you to do of
[57:07] his own good pleasure. Amen. So, don't
[57:09] write off those inner workings and
[57:11] churnings. They're for a purpose. It's
[57:12] God working in you.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe in a future date we'll get
[57:16] into that. And so I was thinking of this
[57:18] too. We don't think of that. And we also
[57:20] kind of think, you know, if I was in
[57:22] China, I've been there. You wake up in
[57:24] the morning and you think, you know, I
[57:25] better have breakfast cuz I I need
[57:26] strength to serve the Lord today. I'm
[57:28] going to do this and visit this person
[57:30] and visit that, right? But here we're
[57:32] like, you know, eat breakfast, go to
[57:34] work, go home. We don't have that same
[57:36] perspective. Well, what's the
[57:37] difference? What's the difference
[57:39] between China having breakfast, wake up
[57:42] up in the morning, have a bowling of
[57:43] Cheerios, and then going out to work
[57:45] here? It's all about perspective.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; It's all about perspective and seeing
[57:49] yourself, who you are, and what's your
[57:51] what's God's purpose for your life.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you'll see God doing
[57:56] special things around you. And don't get
[57:58] me wrong, I'm for missions in China. I'm
[57:59] for missions in Iran. I'm for the young
[58:01] people going to Uganda. Don't get me
[58:02] wrong, okay? But it's perspective about
[58:04] our lives. We're not just churchgoers.
[58:07] Amen. Sons and daughters of God.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. What Ram says, this is one of the
[58:11] Mike Hunt's favorite quotes apparently.
[58:13] I had it down, but I took it out. God,
[58:14] he says in God's simplicity, God hides
[58:17] himself in a man who puts his lunch
[58:19] under his arm and goes to work. He said
[58:20] he can do he can do things through him.
[58:22] An archbishop knows nothing about Amen.
[58:25] A man with his lunchbox going to work.
[58:27] God hiding himself in simplicity.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And so here's another
[58:34] saint here. This is the the journeys of
[58:35] St. Orin Hilderbranch. Amen. He walks
[58:39] about 100 ft every day back and forth.
[58:41] School, home, school, home, school,
[58:44] home. Right. You can't even get the
[58:47] directions on Google Map cuz it's too
[58:48] close.
[58:50] So, I had to do it myself. And I I
[58:52] worked with Orin this summer. He's a
[58:53] saint. Amen. And I was It doesn't sound
[58:56] very dynamic, but what it comes down to
[58:58] is Orin, all you people in school,
[59:01] &gt;&gt; what are you doing in school? Who are
[59:03] you influencing for the good? What are
[59:06] you resisting for the good? You're
[59:09] around over a hundred people every day.
[59:12] I'm around maybe five, right? You're
[59:14] around so many people, but it's a
[59:16] perspective of who you are and what
[59:18] you're doing.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. More than math, more than science,
[59:23] &gt;&gt; more than all of these kind of things.
[59:25] And I was thinking, another five
[59:27] minutes. Okay.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. I know there's some great things
[59:31] coming up tonight. So, Ivan might
[59:32] connect with us, but it's it's
[59:34] perspective, right? I was driving the
[59:36] other day um down 176th toward the
[59:38] highway. Okay, do you know where that is
[59:40] kind of 176th Street toward the highway?
[59:42] It's in the valley. Then you go up this
[59:43] hill towards the highway. Does everyone
[59:45] kind of know what I mean? So I was
[59:46] driving in the valley and it was
[59:47] raining. I went up the hill and it was
[59:49] snowing. I thought right there it's
[59:51] raining. Right here it's snowing, right?
[59:53] Just by coming up a little bit higher.
[59:56] If you can come up a little bit higher,
[59:58] your atmosphere is different. Amen. Just
[1:00:01] by coming up a little higher here, it's
[1:00:03] snow. Here it's not. And somebody could
[1:00:08] be right here and it could be snowing.
[1:00:09] He could have a cell phone talking to
[1:00:11] somebody right here. And this guy could
[1:00:13] say, "It's snowing." And he would say,
[1:00:16] "No, it's not." Right? But and they're
[1:00:18] so close and yet such a different thing
[1:00:20] is taking place around them. Right? Just
[1:00:23] by coming up a little bit higher. And if
[1:00:26] we can come up just a little bit higher
[1:00:27] in our perspective, we'll see God more.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's so simple. Bel says, "Get God
[1:00:32] in you. You'll see him everywhere."
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And for me, uh, in my
[1:00:37] mind to come up higher, the greatest way
[1:00:39] to do it is Matthew 23:11-2. I've been
[1:00:43] sharing this verse a bit. But he that is
[1:00:45] greatest among you shall be your
[1:00:47] servant. Whoever and whosoever shall
[1:00:50] exalt himself shall be abased, and he
[1:00:52] that humble himself shall be exalted.
[1:00:55] Amen. If you can humble yourself, God
[1:00:57] can take you to a higher plateau. Amen.
[1:00:59] If you can take the low route, God can
[1:01:01] take you higher, but it takes being
[1:01:03] humble, it takes being willing to serve,
[1:01:07] Jesus saying is whoever bes your
[1:01:08] servant, so who's ever serving the body
[1:01:10] of Christ, right? And God will take you
[1:01:13] higher, but you got to be willing to
[1:01:14] serve God. Amen. And being humble, as
[1:01:17] brother Kim said, being humble isn't
[1:01:19] just your nature. You know, God bless
[1:01:20] you, brother. God bless you. Because
[1:01:22] some people could be like that. you
[1:01:23] know, God bless you, brother, but I'm
[1:01:26] not going to go to church. I can just
[1:01:27] stay home and listen to tapes. I'm not
[1:01:29] Right. So, they're not they're not being
[1:01:30] humble to the word of God. Just their
[1:01:32] nature is humble,
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; right? You have someone like Brother
[1:01:35] Benoa. I love I love him. He doesn't
[1:01:38] come across as super duper humble,
[1:01:41] but he's so humble. He's married now and
[1:01:44] he's still serving God wherever he can.
[1:01:46] He put up those basketball hoops in the
[1:01:48] gym that we so enjoy. A newly married
[1:01:51] man. He doesn't have to do that. He's
[1:01:53] humble, serving the body of Christ. And
[1:01:56] God, give him a wife and give him a
[1:01:58] house. He's going to live just down the
[1:02:00] street in a house, right? He's humble.
[1:02:02] Amen. And God takes him higher. Amen.
[1:02:05] Just willing to serve, willing to do
[1:02:07] something for God. God will take you
[1:02:08] higher. Amen. I don't want to have what
[1:02:10] I call, and excuse me if this offends
[1:02:12] you, but I don't want to have bride
[1:02:14] pride,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; I'm the bride of Christ. I'm so good. Uh
[1:02:19] if what would people do without me?
[1:02:22] Everybody else is serpent seed. Right?
[1:02:25] You you can be embarrassed to go to
[1:02:26] restaurants with people. No respect to
[1:02:28] the waiter. No respect to the waitress.
[1:02:31] How is that salty? You're just holding a
[1:02:34] message book with long hair and long
[1:02:35] skirt. Right? You're not you're not
[1:02:37] carrying yourself the right way. And
[1:02:39] it's like this. Am I going too long? I'm
[1:02:43] I'm sorry. But um and you get people say
[1:02:47] you have the David, can you come here? I
[1:02:50] love Blood David. He's humble to me. He
[1:02:51] loves the word of God. Here's an
[1:02:52] example. Okay, let's say I say to David,
[1:02:54] you know, Blood David, I really don't
[1:02:55] like the police. The police do this and
[1:02:57] the police do that and the police,
[1:02:59] they're such bad people, right? Let's
[1:03:00] say I'm making fun of the police to him.
[1:03:02] Right? If all a sudden I see a guy in my
[1:03:05] backyard with a crowbar and a hood, I'm
[1:03:08] not going to call the David. I'm calling
[1:03:10] the police.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Right. So, we need to be humble. Oh,
[1:03:13] thanks for the David. Appreciate you.
[1:03:18] Right. The Bible says, "Let every soul
[1:03:19] be subject unto the higher powers. For
[1:03:22] there is no power but of God. The powers
[1:03:24] that be are ordained of God. Whosoever
[1:03:27] therefore resisteth the power resisteth
[1:03:30] the ordinance of God."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Right. The Bible, the Bible, Sister
[1:03:35] Gerta. Right. Amen. We need to Oh, the
[1:03:38] border guard this and the border guard
[1:03:40] that. They're protecting the country.
[1:03:42] They've been shot at recently, right? So
[1:03:45] what if you're a nice person? I if they
[1:03:47] only knew me and so forth. Yeah. Right.
[1:03:49] Every day they have people going through
[1:03:51] there who aren't nice and they're mean
[1:03:52] and so forth. Be humble. Amen. Be
[1:03:56] willing to be salty.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't just have pride pride. Amen.
[1:04:00] Jesus, look at his example. People tore
[1:04:03] his beard out and he washed feet, right?
[1:04:06] I gave you an example to be humble and
[1:04:09] to serve. Amen. So that's part of my uh
[1:04:14] thing for the new year. Have the a
[1:04:15] humble perspective. Almost done. My
[1:04:18] little Bethlehem, let me tell you,
[1:04:20] brother, no matter who you are, you want
[1:04:22] to know how important you are? I said to
[1:04:24] my little girl, stick your finger in a
[1:04:25] bucket of water and pull it out and try
[1:04:27] to find the hole. We're nothing. There's
[1:04:30] only one important. That's God. We must
[1:04:32] remember he's the one. Amen. God's the
[1:04:35] important one. Amen. God's the one who
[1:04:37] let us come in this church building
[1:04:39] tonight. Amen. And God's the one who let
[1:04:41] us let us go out these doors. He is the
[1:04:44] important one. Amen. And we want to
[1:04:45] serve him with all of our heart. Amen.
[1:04:48] And so we're so thankful for, you know,
[1:04:50] things like Mount Baker Bible Way Camp,
[1:04:52] the message hub, our church missions,
[1:04:55] and the schools, but it's the grace of
[1:04:57] God.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And these things don't make us
[1:05:00] better than any other bride member
[1:05:01] around the world. Amen. These are things
[1:05:03] that God gave us for some sort of
[1:05:05] purpose. Amen. Please forgive me if this
[1:05:08] offends you, but one person time two
[1:05:10] people were talking here and someone was
[1:05:12] saying, you know, we have the best
[1:05:13] church and we have the best ministry and
[1:05:15] like this and like this and their
[1:05:16] brother said the bride of Christ has the
[1:05:18] best ministry cuz it's the bridegroom
[1:05:21] ministering to the bride. Amen. All God
[1:05:24] has people all around the world. Amen.
[1:05:26] Let's be humble.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Right? Be humble.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're a more visible church, but
[1:05:32] be humble.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; There's people out there who are serving
[1:05:36] God with all their heart. Brother Boz
[1:05:37] and Bozie, people you'll never hear
[1:05:39] about just as important to the body of
[1:05:41] Christ as you are or as I am. Amen. Be
[1:05:44] humble. Bill Graham says, "And humble
[1:05:46] thyself." Show me a church that's
[1:05:48] humble. I'll show you a church that has
[1:05:50] the power and favor of God.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Humble.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm I'm done here in about 10
[1:05:58] seconds. So, 2013,
[1:06:00] whatever people are thinking this will
[1:06:02] happen, that will happen. farmers,
[1:06:03] almanac, and all this kind of stuff.
[1:06:05] Just have a Bible perspective. Say, God,
[1:06:08] just keep me in the middle of the road
[1:06:10] and man, let let the trash of fanaticism
[1:06:12] go this way and let the trash of just
[1:06:14] rigid Baptist
[1:06:17] go that way and just help me stay on the
[1:06:20] middle of the road and be humble and
[1:06:22] serve you, Jesus, and have a a right
[1:06:26] perspective. Amen. God bless you. I hope
[1:06:28] that something made sense. really
[1:06:30] appreciate uh eight years here.
[1:06:36] [applause]
[1:06:38] Thank you, brother Cal.
[1:06:41] Amen. Lord, I lift your name. Maybe you
[1:06:42] want to stand for a moment.

[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:11:20] Um as you know um
[1:11:25] the Lord is that established the
[1:11:27] printing office in China through a group
[1:11:29] of humble believers here you can see on
[1:11:32] the back you can see they're working
[1:11:34] it's a working day busy day it's also
[1:11:37] our new year time
[1:11:40] in year 2012
[1:11:44] we printed 94,000
[1:11:48] books
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; 94,000
[1:11:51] Exactly.
[1:11:53] And we just received an order
[1:11:56] for the new year, the first month of new
[1:11:59] year. It's u 8,300
[1:12:02] books, including 420 Korean messages
[1:12:06] and 100 Japanese message.
[1:12:11] So um from the start of the printing
[1:12:14] station to now we
[1:12:18] send sended
[1:12:23] 127,000 books up.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; You can hear the number.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Well, the spoken word is the original
[1:12:33] seed. All the original seeds are now
[1:12:36] satisfying and changing many hungry
[1:12:39] souls here in China.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:45] And now we are not only formatting the

[1:12:53] it into tabs epo for the great number of
[1:12:59] smartphones and tablet users them to to
[1:13:02] be able to reach end time message. Amen.
[1:13:09] God sometimes spreading his gospel by
[1:13:12] many avenues many times high above our
[1:13:16] thoughts right
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; for example last month two brothers came
[1:13:21] uh I went to McDonald's so I I know you
[1:13:25] know these two brothers pretty well and
[1:13:27] we talked to to them later on
[1:13:31] and u when we finished praying amen and
[1:13:35] a young lady just come approached
[1:13:37] and talk to us. She was just talking to
[1:13:41] her friends saying she wants to become a
[1:13:44] Christian and
[1:13:47] ready to be baptized trying to be
[1:13:48] baptized. When when she was talking to
[1:13:52] her friend,
[1:13:54] she heard amen from us.
[1:13:58] first team fellowshipped with us and uh
[1:14:00] so we spend a few uh time few hours and
[1:14:05] just fellowship with her and send her a
[1:14:07] few books. Last Sunday she was baptized
[1:14:10] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Just two days ago.
[1:14:20] Well, what should I say then? God who
[1:14:22] makes Peter fishes of men for added to
[1:14:25] his his house. He's still ordering the
[1:14:28] steps of good man. So let us spread the
[1:14:31] word of God with boldness.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Uh I think brother Abraham said uh the
[1:14:37] gospel will go back to the oldest civil
[1:14:40] civilization China. But I think this
[1:14:43] world this word will not
[1:14:46] it is actually manifesting in front of
[1:14:49] your eyes.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you brother.

[1:22:52] That's what the Chinese believers do
[1:22:56] with everything they have. I don't know
[1:22:58] whether you heard brother Ivan when he
[1:23:00] was speaking. And now maybe the Russian
[1:23:02] uh singer, the brothers and sisters that
[1:23:03] will be singing in Russian, why don't
[1:23:05] you come and make your way while I make
[1:23:06] a couple announcements here. We're
[1:23:08] looking forward to that. Come on down.
[1:23:11] Brother Ivan, I don't know if it was
[1:23:13] clear enough to you. Uh I was seeing it.
[1:23:15] You weren't seeing the picture, but
[1:23:17] Brother Ivan and his sister Aanath were
[1:23:21] standing right in front of their little
[1:23:22] camera. And behind them was a pile or
[1:23:26] shouldn't pile just a group of people
[1:23:28] that were making books.
[1:23:31] And they are working right now printing
[1:23:34] more the message to get out to China.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And they had done over
[1:23:41] 127,000
[1:23:43] books this year by hand. I say, "Praise
[1:23:47] the Lord."
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; That's amazing. That is amazing to have
[1:23:55] in a little room a group of people come
[1:23:57] on down and
[1:24:00] have them staple, print, and put them
[1:24:02] together and have them ready to go out
[1:24:05] all through China. I think that is
[1:24:07] amazing.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; And you know, the footsteps of the
[1:24:09] righteous are ordered of the Lord. In
[1:24:11] everything that we do, God has an order.
[1:24:14] and that and we need to remember that
[1:24:16] and thank God for it. But brother Toby
[1:24:19] and my son Michael went to China just a
[1:24:22] few weeks ago. And what brother Ivan was
[1:24:24] saying is here's a a a cup here's
[1:24:27] brother Toby and my son in China. And
[1:24:30] Michael only will eat chicken.
[1:24:34] So he says, so they go to the rest this
[1:24:36] particular restaurant and they said, "Do
[1:24:38] you have chicken?" They said, "We're out
[1:24:39] of chicken." Michael says, "No way.
[1:24:40] We're I'm not eating here." So they went
[1:24:42] to a McDonald's
[1:24:44] and right across the street was a
[1:24:46] McDonald's. This is what brother Ivan
[1:24:47] was saying, that sister that was
[1:24:49] baptized. They were in McDonald's with
[1:24:52] brother Ivan, Toby, and Michael. And
[1:24:55] they bowed their heads and prayed over
[1:24:57] their food. And there was a lady sitting
[1:24:59] at another table watching them. And she
[1:25:02] was just saying to another lady, "I
[1:25:06] would like to ask a Christian some
[1:25:08] questions."
[1:25:10] And there God brought them right there
[1:25:12] at that little restaurant. Brother Ivan
[1:25:15] has just baptized her for the glory of
[1:25:17] God. Amen.

[1:39:40] [applause]
[1:39:46] Amen. Brother Steven Dodd going to sing
[1:39:49] a song for us. We had the privilege of
[1:39:50] having brother Steven and his wife,
[1:39:52] Sister Lisa, and their children out at
[1:39:53] the camp over the holiday and just had a
[1:39:56] real wonderful time of fellowship. If
[1:39:58] you get a chance when they're in town,
[1:40:01] don't rob yourself. Have them over. They
[1:40:03] really enjoy it. God bless you.
[1:40:10] There we don't uh we don't charge rent
[1:40:12] for our our bedrooms for our guests. So,
[1:40:25] I'm sure enjoyed our time with you,
[1:40:26] brother Derek.
[1:40:32] [music]
[1:40:39] [music]
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; It's not hard to believe.
[1:40:55] Standing on the [singing] mountain tops
[1:40:58] of glory.
[1:41:02] [music]
[1:41:05] When you can hear the song of angels
[1:41:09] [music]
[1:41:09] and the breeze from heaven sends your
[1:41:13] spirit soaring.
[1:41:15] [music]
[1:41:20] But in [music] the valley once more,
[1:41:24] will Jesus still be Lord? That's the
[1:41:28] question.
[1:41:35] For believing when believing isn't easy,
[1:41:41] [music]
[1:41:42] that is the testing.
[1:41:48] Oh, I [music] need faith for the time
[1:41:53] when the sun does not [singing] shine
[1:41:57] and the [music] mountaintop is just a
[1:42:01] memory.
[1:42:04] When [music] there's no signs [singing]
[1:42:06] to be seen
[1:42:08] and I don't feel a thing
[1:42:12] to the [music] word of God alone, I must
[1:42:16] cling
[1:42:17] and I need faith for the day [singing]
[1:42:23] when [music] trouble comes my way and I
[1:42:27] just don't understand [singing]
[1:42:29] what it [music] means.
[1:42:33] That's when nothing else will do.
[1:42:36] [music]
[1:42:37] Faith alone will get me through.
[1:42:41] And [music] believing becomes my
[1:42:45] victory.
[1:42:48] [music]
[1:42:51] It's not hard to believe [music] when
[1:42:56] things are going well and skies are
[1:43:00] sunny.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; When you feel you're making progress,
[1:43:10] doing good, living [music] in a time of
[1:43:14] plenty.
[1:43:19] Oh, [music]
[1:43:21] but if all of that should change,
[1:43:24] would you still keep [music] the faith?
[1:43:28] That's the question.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; for believing when believing isn't
[1:43:39] [music]
[1:43:39] easy.
[1:43:42] That is the testing.
[1:43:45] Oh, I need faith [music] for the time
[1:43:50] when the sun [singing] does not shine
[1:43:53] and the mountain [music] top is just a
[1:43:57] memory.
[1:44:00] when there's [music] no signs [singing]
[1:44:02] to be seen
[1:44:04] and I don't feel a thing [music] for to
[1:44:08] the word of God alone. I must cling.
[1:44:13] And I need [music] faith for the day
[1:44:18] when trouble comes my way. [music] And I
[1:44:23] just don't understand what it means.
[1:44:29] Oh, that's [music and singing] when
[1:44:30] nothing else will do.
[1:44:33] Faith alone will get me through. [music]
[1:44:37] and believing becomes my victory.
[1:44:42] Oh, [music and singing] I need faith for
[1:44:46] the time when the sun [music]
[1:44:49] does not shine
[1:44:51] and the mountain top is just a memory.
[1:44:55] [music]
[1:44:58] When there's no signs to be seen [music]
[1:45:02] and I don't feel a thing
[1:45:06] to the word of God alone, I must cling
[1:45:11] and I [singing]
[1:45:12] need [music] faith for the day.
[1:45:16] When trouble comes my way and I [music]
[1:45:21] just don't understand what it means.
[1:45:27] Oh, that's [music] when nothing else
[1:45:29] will do.
[1:45:31] Faith alone will get me [music] through.
[1:45:34] Yes, that's when nothing else will do.
[1:45:38] Faith alone will get me through. [music]
[1:45:42] And believing
[1:45:44] becomes my victory.
[1:45:48] [music]
[1:45:52] I
[1:45:53] pray for the time when the sun [music]
[1:45:58] does not shine
[1:46:00] and the mountain dog [singing] is just
[1:46:03] another
[1:46:05] [music]
[1:46:08] sign to be seen [music]
[1:46:11] and I don't feel
[1:46:15] the word of [music] God alone [singing]
[1:46:18] I must
[1:46:20] I
[1:46:22] [music] faith for the day
[1:46:25] when trouble comes my way [music]
[1:46:29] and I just don't understand
[1:46:32] what it means. [music]
[1:46:35] That's when nothing else will do.
[1:46:40] May the Lord will get me through [music]
[1:46:43] and believing
[1:46:45] becomes my victory. [music]
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:46:59] [applause]
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:06] You believe that?
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats.
[1:47:11] I'm not going to sing with you.
[1:47:14] That's the singer in the family.
[1:47:17] Amen.
[1:47:20] Well, it's been quite a year.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; It's been quite a year. Anybody had a
[1:47:25] trial this year?
[1:47:28] Anybody had a trial this year?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Me, too.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; It's been a good year.
[1:47:36] Amen. Anybody feel like they weren't
[1:47:38] going to make it through the trial?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Me, too.
[1:47:45] I felt like that at odd time,
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; but we made it.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Anybody glad to be here tonight?
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah, me too.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; It's good to be here tonight.
[1:48:00] We made it.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; 2012.
[1:48:04] It's been quite a year. Every trial is
[1:48:07] is relative. Everybody has their own
[1:48:09] trial and everybody goes through what
[1:48:12] God sees that uh we have need of and
[1:48:16] what he and his sovereignty
[1:48:19] chooses to mold us in our character
[1:48:22] knowing that we all must be molded
[1:48:24] because character is not a gift. It's a
[1:48:28] victory.
[1:48:30] And that's what we appreciate about the
[1:48:32] revealed word of the hour is just
[1:48:33] knowing those simple little truths that
[1:48:36] carry us through. You can put that
[1:48:38] picture up if you would on the screen.
[1:48:44] And uh
[1:48:47] greetings from brother Murphy,
[1:48:54] perspective.
[1:48:56] Where's Brother Kyle? Perspective. I
[1:48:58] always knew I liked his sense of humor.
[1:49:00] I didn't realize till tonight he was
[1:49:02] half German and half English
[1:49:05] there. There was always something
[1:49:06] special about him.
[1:49:09] And uh brother Murphy sends his
[1:49:11] greetings tonight and he's in Grand
[1:49:13] Prairie as you can see by the picture
[1:49:16] here. He says, "I took this picture
[1:49:17] yesterday from the church." And he says,
[1:49:20] "All my impression about Grand Prairie
[1:49:22] is snow, snow, snow, and cold, cold,
[1:49:25] cold,
[1:49:28] but actually I like it."
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; How come we were so quiet on that one?
[1:49:36] He says, "It's not as gloomy and raining
[1:49:39] miserable as at home.
[1:49:42] At least they got lots of sunshine
[1:49:44] here."
[1:49:46] He said, "We had two meetings yesterday.
[1:49:47] I trust the Lord had put something in
[1:49:50] the people's hearts that will help them
[1:49:52] down the road through the preaching of
[1:49:54] the word. He says they're a wonderful
[1:49:56] congregation. Brother Darren and the
[1:49:58] saints here asked me to pass the
[1:50:01] greetings and love to brother Ed
[1:50:04] yourself, all the ministers
[1:50:06] and all the saints in Cloverdale. So God
[1:50:10] bless you from brother Murphy tonight
[1:50:12] who is in Grand Prairie having his own
[1:50:15] trial. Actually,
[1:50:18] he's having a good time and uh we sure
[1:50:21] appreciate him going up there. The
[1:50:22] Saints, I got a letter, a note from
[1:50:23] Brother Darren. He said, "I I
[1:50:26] uh have lost count of all the wonderful
[1:50:29] blessings we have received this week
[1:50:31] through Brother Murphy. The saints have
[1:50:32] really appreciated it. And so, Sister
[1:50:35] Tracy, God bless you for sparing your
[1:50:37] husband. Uh put the extra blanket on the
[1:50:39] bed when he gets home and he'll want to
[1:50:41] warm up, I'm sure. Give him a sweater
[1:50:44] and whatever else he has in need of.
[1:50:46] Praise the Lord. Well, we've come to
[1:50:48] this time of year that we call uh
[1:50:51] turning the page of a calendar.
[1:50:54] And uh
[1:50:57] you know, time is just a figure of
[1:50:59] speech. It's just a word.
[1:51:03] And uh really as what you what we look
[1:51:06] back this year at is a uh a series of
[1:51:09] interconnected
[1:51:11] events that have brought us to the place
[1:51:14] that we now stand.
[1:51:16] The events of your life might be a
[1:51:18] little bit different than the events of
[1:51:19] my life, but God saw fit that we would
[1:51:23] go through those events. And and uh in
[1:51:28] the scripture when God refers to events,
[1:51:31] God refers to rather a space of time or
[1:51:34] a period of time. Most often, God does
[1:51:37] not refer to a a calendar, but he refers
[1:51:42] to a sequence of events that have
[1:51:45] brought a person to the place where they
[1:51:49] are now at. Because our life, we
[1:51:52] realize, has a destiny. Predestination,
[1:51:56] excuse [clears throat] me,
[1:51:57] predestination speaks to that. Speaks
[1:52:00] that there is a destiny.
[1:52:02] God speaking in Joshua chapter 24. He
[1:52:06] says,
[1:52:08] he says to Israel, "Thus saith the Lord
[1:52:10] God of Israel, your fathers dwelt on the
[1:52:14] other side of the flood in old time is
[1:52:16] speaking the flood is speaking of the
[1:52:18] Jordan River. The other side of the
[1:52:20] flood in old time, even Terra, the
[1:52:23] father of Abraham and the father of Nor
[1:52:26] and they served other gods. And I took
[1:52:28] your father Abraham from the other side
[1:52:30] of the flood, and led him throughout all
[1:52:33] the land of Canaan,
[1:52:35] and multiplied his seed, and gave him
[1:52:37] Isaac. And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and
[1:52:42] Esau, and I gave unto Esau mount Seir to
[1:52:44] possess it. But Jacob and his children
[1:52:47] went down into Egypt. And God goes on
[1:52:50] and he says, "And I sent Moses and
[1:52:51] Aaron, and I plagued Egypt." And as he
[1:52:54] lists these things in Joshua 24, as
[1:52:57] Joshua has come to the end of his life
[1:52:59] and his ministry,
[1:53:00] he's looking back over the things that
[1:53:03] have happened since the time that God
[1:53:05] called Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and
[1:53:08] the events of his life. And brother
[1:53:11] Brandham so took us through many things
[1:53:13] that that were key points that are
[1:53:15] brought out in the scripture for a
[1:53:18] purpose that were reflecting something
[1:53:20] that was to come.
[1:53:22] In one place he takes it he takes the
[1:53:24] scripture of Abraham
[1:53:27] uh taking Isaac on up on the mountain to
[1:53:31] sacrifice him at the uh at the command
[1:53:34] of God.
[1:53:36] And uh as he takes him up there on the
[1:53:39] mountain
[1:53:41] in Genesis 22, the angel of the Lord
[1:53:43] calls out and says,"Abraham, stay your
[1:53:45] hand." and and he calls to him the
[1:53:48] second time and he says, "By myself have
[1:53:51] I sworn, sayaeth the Lord, for because
[1:53:53] thou has done this thing and has not
[1:53:55] withheld thy son, thine only son, that
[1:54:00] in blessing I will bless you, and
[1:54:02] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[1:54:04] the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
[1:54:07] which is upon the seashore, and thy seed
[1:54:11] shall possess the gate of his enemies.
[1:54:16] Brother Brown takes that scripture and
[1:54:17] many times preaches on that and he and
[1:54:20] he calls it possessing the gates of your
[1:54:23] enemy, possessing the gates of the enemy
[1:54:25] and many times uses that title. But then
[1:54:27] in 1964, which I believe is the last
[1:54:30] time he preaches it, he calls it
[1:54:33] possessing the gates of the enemy after
[1:54:37] a trial.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; So it took the trial for Abraham to come
[1:54:43] to that place in his life. It took an
[1:54:45] event. It took God leading him. It
[1:54:47] wasn't a calendar. It wasn't that we can
[1:54:50] say, "Well, we made it through 2012, so
[1:54:52] we've arrived somewhere." If you haven't
[1:54:54] been through something this year, you
[1:54:56] haven't arrived.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, that was awful quiet.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; That's the way life is. It's not about
[1:55:04] we turn the calendar page. We didn't
[1:55:07] come here tonight to turn a calendar
[1:55:08] page. We come here tonight to say we've
[1:55:10] had some victories.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We come here to say tonight, God's
[1:55:14] been with us.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And if God before us, who can be against
[1:55:18] us?
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; And we're rejoicing at the things that
[1:55:22] God has done for us this year.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; We're not rejoicing. We're not
[1:55:25] survivors.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; I I went to a funeral one time. It was a
[1:55:31] I shouldn't say it was I went to a
[1:55:32] funeral. It was my mother's funeral now
[1:55:34] that I think about it. And I was talking
[1:55:36] to a fellow who had lost his wife uh
[1:55:39] through uh um I believe it was cancer.
[1:55:43] And he said to me, he says,"Tim," it was
[1:55:45] a cousin of mine, and uh he said, "Tim,
[1:55:47] I want you to know I'm a survivor." He
[1:55:49] says, "I I know what you're going
[1:55:50] through. I'm a survivor." I says, "I
[1:55:52] appreciate the thought." I said, "But
[1:55:53] I'm not a survivor. I'm an overcomer.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; There's a difference.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; I didn't survive 2012. I overcame 2012."
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight?
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; You didn't survive 2012. You overcame
[1:56:11] 2012.
[1:56:12] Hallelujah. No what? No matter what the
[1:56:14] devil threw in front of you, you
[1:56:16] overcame it.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; And you're here tonight as an overcomer.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Sam. We're overcomers.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are more than conquerors.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, we are. Right.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; So after God recounts in [snorts] Joshua
[1:56:38] 24, as I was referring,
[1:56:42] he says, "I've done this and I've I've
[1:56:44] led Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and and
[1:56:46] done all these things for you. And I
[1:56:48] sent Moses and Aaron, and I sent the
[1:56:49] plagues, and I brought you out with a
[1:56:51] mighty hand, and I brought you through
[1:56:52] the Red Sea, and I brought you through
[1:56:53] the flooding Jordan, and I brought you
[1:56:55] through all these things."
[1:56:58] And Joshua commands him and says, 'Now
[1:56:59] therefore fear the Lord and serve him in
[1:57:04] sincerity and in truth.
[1:57:06] Put away the gods which your fathers
[1:57:08] served on the other side of the flood
[1:57:12] and in Egypt, and serve ye the Lord. And
[1:57:16] if it seem evil unto you to serve the
[1:57:18] Lord, choose you this day whom you will
[1:57:20] serve.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. whether the gods which your father
[1:57:24] served that were on the other side of
[1:57:26] the flood or the gods of the Amorites in
[1:57:29] whose land you dwell. But
[1:57:32] as for me and my house,
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read that again.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; As for me and my house, we will serve
[1:57:48] the Lord.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:52] Amen.
[1:57:58] From about Joshua 18 to to this place in
[1:58:01] Joshua 24,
[1:58:05] Joshua is uh
[1:58:08] arriving at the end of his ministry.
[1:58:12] It's an end of an era. It's the end of
[1:58:15] his life.
[1:58:17] Time, as I said, is just a word, but it
[1:58:21] has gone on.
[1:58:23] They had been in the land for seven
[1:58:24] years, possessing the land.
[1:58:29] 47 years they were into the Exodus,
[1:58:33] 40 years in the wilderness, 7 years in
[1:58:35] the promised land.
[1:58:38] But there still remained much work to be
[1:58:40] done.
[1:58:42] And as Joshua recounts in Joshua 18 at
[1:58:45] the kind of the beginning of this whole
[1:58:47] segment of scripture,
[1:58:49] Joshua says, it says rather that there
[1:58:52] remained among the children of Israel
[1:58:56] seven tribes which had not received
[1:58:58] their inheritance.
[1:59:00] After 40 years in the wilderness and
[1:59:03] seven years in the promised land, 47
[1:59:06] years, there remained seven tribes which
[1:59:09] had not received their inheritance. And
[1:59:11] Joshua said to the children of Israel,
[1:59:12] "How long are you slack to go and
[1:59:16] possess the land which the Lord God of
[1:59:20] your fathers has given you?" has given
[1:59:23] you.
[1:59:25] How long are you slack? Slack means
[1:59:27] disheartened.
[1:59:29] How long are you disheartened? It's a
[1:59:31] question in the time of the Exodus.
[1:59:34] In other words, he's saying it's not a
[1:59:35] time to slack the rains. As we've
[1:59:38] arrived at this time, I chose this
[1:59:41] scripture because we're 47 years past
[1:59:44] 1965
[1:59:46] when the when the message was complete.
[1:59:48] The mystery of God was finished. The
[1:59:49] prophet was taken off the scene. And now
[1:59:52] we've been 47 years down the road. Here
[1:59:54] Joshua at the end of his ministry was 47
[1:59:56] years down the road and said, "There's
[1:59:58] still much to do.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; It's not a time to get slack.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; It's not a time to just relax and say,
[2:00:04] "Oh, well, you know, we we've arrived."
[2:00:06] He says there some of you have not
[2:00:08] possessed your land yet. Matter of fact,
[2:00:10] the majority of the tribes had not
[2:00:12] possessed their land yet.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; And and it actually describes the land
[2:00:17] and says says that the the land was
[2:00:20] subdued before them or literally would
[2:00:22] say we would say the land was under
[2:00:24] their feet.
[2:00:26] As we know that footsteps is possession.
[2:00:29] And so anywhere that their foot would
[2:00:32] trod, God had given them that land. And
[2:00:34] Joshua commanded them. And the scripture
[2:00:36] describes it and said the whole land was
[2:00:38] subdued. But yet they hadn't gone out
[2:00:40] and possessed it all. And I could say
[2:00:42] this evening that the word of God is in
[2:00:44] full effect.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; That the bride of Jesus Christ has come
[2:00:48] to the fullness of the work.
[2:00:51] It's right in our hands, in our midst,
[2:00:53] in our mouth, in our hearts, in our
[2:00:55] lives, in our people.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; And are we possessing it the way that we
[2:00:59] ought to possess it? Don't slack. I'm
[2:01:01] convinced there's much more to do. I'm
[2:01:04] convinced there's there's much that lays
[2:01:06] ahead of us. And I when I say much, I
[2:01:09] don't necessarily mean we have much
[2:01:10] time, but we have much to do.
[2:01:15] And uh I think that we recognize this
[2:01:18] year that uh we are we could say as a
[2:01:22] body of Christ we're losing our Joshua
[2:01:25] and Calebs. I hope that's not too hard
[2:01:27] to say. We saw brother Lonnie Jenkins go
[2:01:31] home just a short time ago. Uh some of
[2:01:35] the old soldiers are beginning to leave
[2:01:39] us here. But Joshua's commission as he
[2:01:42] left was
[2:01:44] don't be disheartened.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Don't be downcast.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Don't be slack.
[2:01:51] And he commanded them to go and to find
[2:01:54] the land and go and search it out.
[2:01:59] And uh that
[2:02:03] if I could say this
[2:02:08] and I'm just trying to conserve time
[2:02:09] here, but if I could just say the word
[2:02:13] of God has been revealed,
[2:02:17] but the word revealed, that is to say,
[2:02:19] the title deed that Adam lost is our
[2:02:22] inheritance.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; And it's been defined. It's been
[2:02:26] described.
[2:02:28] And if there was anything that Israel
[2:02:30] lacked, it was the it was the energy to
[2:02:33] go and take that and make that a
[2:02:36] definition in their life and say this is
[2:02:38] our land. They did not lack going over
[2:02:41] Jordan. They did not lack for the new
[2:02:44] birth. It was the ones that had went
[2:02:46] over Jordan that want needed to go in
[2:02:48] and possess all the land.
[2:02:51] We appreciate the new birth.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; We must have the new birth. without
[2:02:55] crossing Jordan, you'll never possess
[2:02:57] the land. But when you're born again,
[2:02:59] don't stop there.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; That's not the end. That's the
[2:03:02] beginning.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; That's not that's not the the full
[2:03:06] journey. That's the beginning of the
[2:03:08] journey.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; That's entering into the land. And
[2:03:10] that's beginning to possess all of it.
[2:03:13] In the full possessing thereof, there is
[2:03:16] a rapture.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; In the full possessing of it, there is a
[2:03:21] rapture. Amen.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; In this word lays a rapture.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; In the revealing of those seals lays
[2:03:28] rapturing faith.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Laying in there is your inheritance.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Laying in there is your body change. And
[2:03:37] so I would say as Joshua told the
[2:03:39] children of Israel, not being a Joshua,
[2:03:41] but just as Joshua would say it, we need
[2:03:43] to just go and possess it.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; It's laying there for us. We need to lay
[2:03:47] hold of all of as we look forward to the
[2:03:50] new year. We appreciate what we've
[2:03:52] overcome last year. We appreciate the
[2:03:54] victories that God has given us. But
[2:03:56] life has a purpose and the purpose, and
[2:03:58] I'm going to steal your thunder, Steve.
[2:04:00] The purpose is not the training.
[2:04:03] I had him share a message he preached in
[2:04:05] Grand Prairie as we were out at Mount
[2:04:06] Baker at the campground. And he said
[2:04:08] something that inspired me, and we were
[2:04:10] sitting around fellowshipping. I said,
[2:04:11] "Now share that with everybody." And
[2:04:13] these young preachers, they don't like
[2:04:15] to always be the center of attention.
[2:04:17] But he was sharing some things and that
[2:04:19] was very profound in that your life has
[2:04:22] a purpose. And the purpose isn't the
[2:04:24] training.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; The purpose is the character.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; The purpose is the nature of Christ. The
[2:04:32] trials that we go through are only
[2:04:35] training towards a purpose that God has
[2:04:38] for us in this world. Amen.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; We sometimes get a little bit worried
[2:04:42] about the cares of life and all of the
[2:04:44] pressures of life and all of those
[2:04:45] things. That's not the purpose. The
[2:04:47] purpose isn't the job. The purpose isn't
[2:04:50] the hardships. The purpose isn't the
[2:04:52] little things we go through. Those are
[2:04:53] only necessary ingredients for the
[2:04:55] building of the Christlike character
[2:04:57] within the believer to possess all the
[2:05:00] inheritance.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Because power without character is
[2:05:04] demonic, but power with character is fit
[2:05:08] to rule.
[2:05:10] Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; So what is the purpose
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; as we look forward?
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; There is a future.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it might not have looked like
[2:05:23] it, but there is a future.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; What's the purpose? To live Christ.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; To display him. Sometimes we we we
[2:05:35] get focused on one act aspect of the
[2:05:38] purpose. As I close,
[2:05:41] one aspect might be, well, my purpose is
[2:05:43] to if I could just win somebody to Jesus
[2:05:45] Christ. That's a part of the purpose,
[2:05:47] you know, where we're we're we talk
[2:05:49] about it, you know, in missions as we're
[2:05:52] focused on missions and the things that
[2:05:55] we've done, whether it be, you know, the
[2:05:58] Chinese Bible or the the reader project,
[2:06:01] the the hub engine uh search project,
[2:06:04] search engine project, the family alter
[2:06:07] books, which are in uh uh regular format
[2:06:10] or digital format, the the faith
[2:06:13] challenge reports, hitting a million and
[2:06:16] downloads on the hub.
[2:06:19] Uh whether it be adding new languages
[2:06:21] like we have seen the the the Arabic,
[2:06:24] the Korean, the Erdo languages, some
[2:06:27] major languages in the world that are
[2:06:29] necessary to get the message into the
[2:06:32] hands of the people. The meetings
[2:06:35] uh been a lot of meetings since I've
[2:06:37] been here going, Brother Biscll's been
[2:06:39] traveling a lot. went with him to North
[2:06:41] Carolina. Then he was in Murphy'sboro
[2:06:43] while I was in Holland. And then he went
[2:06:45] over to Dallas and and different
[2:06:47] meetings and new meetings coming up in
[2:06:49] the new year and missionary meetings and
[2:06:51] and conventions and things that we'll be
[2:06:54] traveling and ministering and and we we
[2:06:56] have all of these things that we're
[2:06:57] doing and these we we might call them
[2:07:00] projects or we might call them uh
[2:07:02] necessary things that we have to do. I
[2:07:04] think brother Tom's going to China. I
[2:07:05] just dropped that in there just so uh we
[2:07:08] I always emphasize brother Tom's going
[2:07:10] to China
[2:07:12] and all of these things we get focused
[2:07:14] on.
[2:07:16] But now I just want to I just want to
[2:07:17] focus it right down and say the real
[2:07:20] purpose the real purpose is to live
[2:07:23] Christ
[2:07:25] to display him
[2:07:28] to be him
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; in every moment
[2:07:33] in every situation.
[2:07:37] When the word was made flesh 2,000 years
[2:07:40] ago,
[2:07:42] Jesus did not take a holiday from being
[2:07:45] Christ.
[2:07:55] word made flesh in that day.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; And the bride is the word made flesh in
[2:08:03] this day.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; In whatever the situation is, whether
[2:08:07] you're on an airline sitting beside
[2:08:09] somebody and you share with them the
[2:08:11] gospel, whether you're in a supermarket
[2:08:14] sharing it with somebody there, whether
[2:08:16] you're on the job, whether you're in the
[2:08:18] school as we heard tonight, whatever it
[2:08:19] might be, the purpose is to be him.
[2:08:25] That's the entire purpose.
[2:08:28] It's not what would Jesus do, that's an
[2:08:31] old saying, but rather what is the word
[2:08:35] in me moving me to do
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; this year.
[2:08:43] God bless you.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name.
[2:08:55] Amen. Let's sing together. In Jesus
[2:08:57] [music] name,

[2:16:43] [music]
[2:16:50] Let [music]
[2:16:51] all
[2:16:57] [music] the glory
[2:17:01] I glory
[2:17:04] to my
[2:17:09] glory. [music]
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm
[2:17:24] going to speak the obvious.
[2:17:26] Next New Year, we're going to have a
[2:17:28] group from Cloverdale
[2:17:31] that's going to come up and sing. And
[2:17:34] maybe we'll just call it from Canada
[2:17:36] just in case.
[2:17:42] just praise God.
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Uh I just give back the glory
[2:17:49] and thanks for the Lord that that's what
[2:17:52] he gave to our life. I don't know to to
[2:17:58] be uh you know emotional but it's good
[2:18:00] to be emotional in the Lord right not
[2:18:04] bad at all. Yeah. And
[2:18:07] thank you Lord God because brother Tom
[2:18:10] said that I will say something
[2:18:13] uh I must blow my horn.
[2:18:17] Yeah my friend's horn because
[2:18:20] I was a band members before too you know
[2:18:24] my you know and I was a member of the
[2:18:26] band members then
[2:18:30] my instruments a friend's horn and
[2:18:33] sometimes it's a bus. So if my conductor
[2:18:40] give me the sign to blow my horn, I must
[2:18:42] blow it.
[2:18:45] And the the one that are in the fronts
[2:18:48] that are always soloist, they they are
[2:18:51] waiting to blow my horn.
[2:18:54] So I must blow that one.
[2:18:59] So sometimes the masterpiece that we are
[2:19:02] playing is so port changing the beat
[2:19:07] sometimes it is go to change the bit
[2:19:10] into one half sometimes in three part
[2:19:14] and sometimes it become pass
[2:19:17] that's why we I must see to it I must
[2:19:20] see to it that my conductor I'm looking
[2:19:23] with the conductor and the word
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; the note
[2:19:28] And I don't know when I was in the
[2:19:30] Philippines I was so I don't I don't
[2:19:34] expect that
[2:19:35] we are in your front. I am in your front
[2:19:39] but I believe that God bring me here
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; and I we we I play the great masterpiece
[2:19:50] of God since I hear the message.
[2:19:55] I saw it so and I love it and he changed
[2:19:59] me.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; He changed me not only in my heart
[2:20:05] in my heart deep in my heart and I want
[2:20:07] him more more more
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; and please Lord
[2:20:13] change me more and mold me more not only
[2:20:17] me and
[2:20:19] all the Filipino and all our brother and
[2:20:22] sister here.
[2:20:25] And and now I can see that we have a
[2:20:27] great masterpiece
[2:20:29] that we are playing in.
[2:20:32] If our great conductor will
[2:20:35] point us, give the signal to blow our
[2:20:38] horn, we must blow our horn.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Especially when we are alone in the work
[2:20:44] or we are in the market or we are in
[2:20:47] McDonald, we must not be shy praying our
[2:20:52] food. That's the character of the
[2:20:54] Christian.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; And thank you Lord God in this church.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; I see the hands of God here.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; It changed me a lot.
[2:21:05] I was a backslider but still I stand up
[2:21:08] because he's with me
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; by his grace. I do all his work. I do
[2:21:14] his word and I'm always praying that
[2:21:17] Lord God
[2:21:19] teach me more. Lord God, give me more
[2:21:22] your blessing and teach me more. Teach
[2:21:25] me more to wait third until your coming
[2:21:28] until the final and we call it the the
[2:21:32] final or the final say signs of the
[2:21:36] conductor will go like that and all will
[2:21:38] be stopped.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you for the Lord and we are
[2:21:42] singing.
[2:21:44] Hope you will be blessed in our
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; our our peace Lord God.

[2:26:30] [music]
[2:26:37] [applause]
[2:26:46] Amen.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Enjoying it.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; The last two lines of the song that the
[2:26:55] Filipino group were singing
[2:26:57] uh just fits in with exactly the few
[2:27:00] comments that I have. I'm going to be
[2:27:02] very brief, but I want to tell about two
[2:27:06] men that Jesus spoke about in just a few
[2:27:09] moments. But the two lines that they
[2:27:12] were in the chorus that the group were
[2:27:15] just singing, I will do anything and I
[2:27:18] will give everything. Uh that that
[2:27:21] happened to be a very very powerful
[2:27:22] statement. And uh I happen to have some
[2:27:27] quotes that were right in line with uh
[2:27:30] what they just sang and I want to leave
[2:27:32] them with you. Uh we're soon departing
[2:27:35] what we know as uh 2013 20 uh 2012 and
[2:27:40] going into 2013.
[2:27:42] And uh uh I was just thinking uh before
[2:27:46] coming to the service this evening, none
[2:27:48] of us really know what 2013 holds. Uh we
[2:27:52] always say well the next year holds we
[2:27:54] don't know what it holds. Uh and I think
[2:27:57] what the best uh counsel that I could
[2:28:01] give in the fewest words possible would
[2:28:04] be that we need to make preparation. We
[2:28:08] should be mentally prepared for whatever
[2:28:10] it holds
[2:28:12] that it's not going to move me.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be shaken by it. And
[2:28:19] that calls for preparation. Now, we can
[2:28:21] do that even tonight. Say whatever it
[2:28:24] holds. I'm sold out to God.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; I just want to be sold out to his will.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; I will do anything and I will give
[2:28:31] everything just to be able to walk this
[2:28:34] road. And we've we've rejoiced tonight.
[2:28:37] Uh but we want to do just a little bit
[2:28:40] of serious thinking for just a few
[2:28:42] minutes. one the Jesus told the story of
[2:28:45] two men and they both uh built a house
[2:28:50] and both of them experienced winds and
[2:28:54] storms and a severe shaking
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; and one of them stood and remained
[2:29:03] standing and one of them collapsed. Now
[2:29:06] those two men were probably men that
[2:29:09] Jesus knew or spoke of. I don't think it
[2:29:12] was just a parable and the only
[2:29:15] difference was they both heard the same
[2:29:19] words and one did them and one did not.
[2:29:24] And so Jesus describing the situation of
[2:29:27] the two men's lives probably both fine
[2:29:30] men probably had neighbors. Uh they were
[2:29:34] probably people that could sit in a
[2:29:35] service like this. They could clap their
[2:29:38] hands and enjoy the singing and enjoy
[2:29:40] the words and nod their head and perhaps
[2:29:43] say amen. Uh but one of them walked out
[2:29:46] and didn't do it
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; and the other one actually did it.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; And the difference between the two is
[2:29:53] the one that did it, we might say, well,
[2:29:55] what is it that means to do the word or
[2:29:58] to do what we hear? I've been pondering
[2:30:02] a great deal upon what are the
[2:30:04] commandments of the Lord? What are the
[2:30:06] statutes? What are his precepts? What is
[2:30:09] his counsel? And I can tell you that
[2:30:11] anything that we have out here in the
[2:30:14] world. And when we leave this place and
[2:30:16] we're out on the out
[2:30:18] of education or places our places of our
[2:30:22] work or places of our endeavor, this
[2:30:24] world is not conducive to the word of
[2:30:27] God. This world is not conducive to
[2:30:31] living a godly spiritual life. And one
[2:30:34] thing that is an earmark of a spiritual
[2:30:37] life is it's a giving life.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; I will do anything and I will give
[2:30:42] everything. And and and you might say,
[2:30:45] well, soon as we talk about giving, we
[2:30:47] think about money. I'm not talking about
[2:30:48] money. I'm talking about your life. You
[2:30:51] got youth, you should use it. You got
[2:30:54] strength, health that come from God.
[2:30:57] There's a lot of people don't have
[2:30:59] health tonight. And I think about
[2:31:01] myself. I was just thinking in the last
[2:31:03] few days, uh, we have no guarantee.
[2:31:06] There's people, uh, there's people that
[2:31:09] are a whole lot younger than myself and
[2:31:11] younger than you sitting here that are
[2:31:13] stricken down. There's children in the
[2:31:15] children's hospital just hanging on by
[2:31:18] by a a thread of life, just children.
[2:31:22] And you go to the sick hospital and here
[2:31:24] at Christmas time and so on, people are
[2:31:26] visiting, the firemen visit and so on.
[2:31:28] And I look at that and I see that in the
[2:31:31] paper and so on. I I just think it's
[2:31:33] such a travesty and such a tragedy that
[2:31:37] the that we have that in the country,
[2:31:40] but yet we can't if if like brother
[2:31:42] Brandon said, if I were God, I would I
[2:31:45] would heal you. But that is something.
[2:31:47] And then people think that God's
[2:31:49] allowing this. Listen, friends, it's the
[2:31:52] world that it's the world that man has
[2:31:55] devised. Man has put this world
[2:31:58] together.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; It's man that has taken and and taken
[2:32:02] all the things and and has perverted it
[2:32:06] and and listen to things that we so
[2:32:08] enjoy. Some of them are very damnable
[2:32:11] things. They can corrupt a person. You
[2:32:14] can listen to music and it can be so
[2:32:16] corrupting. Thank God we're listening to
[2:32:18] good music tonight. Thank God we're
[2:32:20] listening to words that are true. Thank
[2:32:23] God we hear somebody stand up and read
[2:32:25] out of the scripture. And you can read
[2:32:27] about these two men in Matthew the 7th
[2:32:30] chapter. And the Bible says that one was
[2:32:32] wise and one was foolish.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; And the only difference between the two,
[2:32:39] the wise man dug deep.
[2:32:42] And that's I want to leave you with that
[2:32:44] tonight. I think in preparation
[2:32:49] for 2013,
[2:32:51] in preparation for the rest of your
[2:32:54] life, what you want to do is dig deep.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; You want to hear what you're hearing
[2:33:00] tonight and dig deep and build your life
[2:33:05] on a solid foundation and something that
[2:33:09] cannot shake. And the one thing that
[2:33:11] cannot shake is this word of God. It
[2:33:16] will never shake. And when God makes it
[2:33:19] real to you,
[2:33:21] uh, it will be a reality. I mean, it
[2:33:24] will be so real. I want to give you two
[2:33:27] or three quotes before I close
[2:33:31] because I would like you to prepare this
[2:33:35] next year to give yourself.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Give what you have.
[2:33:43] In fact is I may want to shock you a wee
[2:33:45] bit tonight. We haven't even started.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; We haven't even started there. There's
[2:33:51] very few people that actually give
[2:33:53] themselves unreservedly.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; When I was a teenager like some of you
[2:33:58] young fellas here, God gave me a car. I
[2:34:01] was hauling kids to church every Sunday.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Don't be quiet now
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; because you see me, you know, my white
[2:34:10] hair and say, "Oh, yeah. I was fine for
[2:34:12] you. Uh, I was a teenager one day and I
[2:34:16] had a car and I got married young and we
[2:34:19] had little children and we had people in
[2:34:22] our house all the time. We had people
[2:34:26] over there all the time. You say, "Well,
[2:34:27] what do I do?" Well, start inviting
[2:34:30] somebody. There's people here probably
[2:34:32] tonight from Seattle or Tacoma,
[2:34:34] someplace. Maybe they haven't even got a
[2:34:36] place to stay. You say, "Well, if I got
[2:34:38] all prepared and maybe, you know,
[2:34:40] sometime in the future." They're not
[2:34:42] talking about the future, talking about
[2:34:43] tonight. Just give yourself.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to the gospel of Jesus
[2:34:48] Christ.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Give your strength. One day you might
[2:34:50] not have it.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; Give your youth. One day you won't have
[2:34:54] it.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; Because time is going to go on. 213 and
[2:34:58] 2014 and 2015. There'll be a time you
[2:35:01] won't have it. Say, "Oh my, if I only
[2:35:03] could do it." Don't wait till the
[2:35:05] future. Just do it now.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; You weren't expecting that, were you?
[2:35:14] Brother Brandham says this, and I'm
[2:35:15] going to give you three or four quotes
[2:35:17] and then close. What a perfect picture
[2:35:20] today when you begin to feel like you're
[2:35:22] slacking or the devil says it's no use.
[2:35:25] Has he ever said that to you? It's no
[2:35:28] use. Reach down,
[2:35:32] tighten up the belt a little bit, pull
[2:35:35] up the sword a little tighter
[2:35:38] in the hand and go forward. He said, I
[2:35:42] like that. Be ready for the march.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; I want to say to this congregation,
[2:35:50] whatever 2013 holds, tighten up the
[2:35:54] buckle.
[2:35:56] take a firmer grip upon the sword
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; and go forward.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; The devil hates to hear that, but I'm
[2:36:08] saying to you in the name of the Lord,
[2:36:10] do that. And he says in another place,
[2:36:13] "And the angel of God which went before
[2:36:15] the camp of Israel," he's still here.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; He's here this evening in his watch
[2:36:21] night service. And the angel of God that
[2:36:24] went before the camp of Israel, that
[2:36:26] same angel of God that went before the
[2:36:30] camp of Israel is here.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; That's according to a prophet's word.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. He's
[2:36:39] He's present. The same angel is here. We
[2:36:42] just need to recognize him. And he says,
[2:36:45] "And and they removed from the front and
[2:36:47] went behind them. And the pillar of
[2:36:50] cloud went from before
[2:36:52] before their face and stood behind them.
[2:36:55] And I want to say to you this evening,
[2:36:57] whatever 2013 holds, God who knows what
[2:37:02] you're going to face, he's the one that
[2:37:04] can go from in front and behind and
[2:37:06] surround you. And he'll be in front of
[2:37:08] you and be behind you as well. Be
[2:37:10] encouraging you on, be giving you
[2:37:12] wisdom, be thrusting you forward, take a
[2:37:15] hold of the sword.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I decided even myself
[2:37:20] before I got up here to say these few
[2:37:22] comments, I decided I want to turn my
[2:37:24] life. I want to just find more. I want
[2:37:27] to squeeze more time out of the world. I
[2:37:30] want to squeeze more time out of my day
[2:37:32] and just ponder the word of God and
[2:37:35] ponder the message that the prophet of
[2:37:38] God that God used the prophet to send us
[2:37:41] and set ourselves in a direction for our
[2:37:44] lives. I I I think that that would be
[2:37:46] real wise. So he said, "And show us the
[2:37:49] father." So we are not here for that
[2:37:51] purpose. We are here to try to help you.
[2:37:55] And here's my theme in these last three
[2:37:57] four quotes. I'd like everybody to make
[2:38:00] this their resolution. if you make
[2:38:02] resolutions.
[2:38:04] He said, "We are here to try to help
[2:38:06] you, to try to do something to make the
[2:38:10] neighborhood here a little bit easier to
[2:38:13] do right and a little harder to do
[2:38:15] wrong.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; Make life a little more pleasant to you.
[2:38:21] And maybe that God will heal your
[2:38:24] sickness and lengthen your days and save
[2:38:26] the lost and help the churches. We're
[2:38:28] just here to help somebody."
[2:38:31] So many times he said that. He said,
[2:38:34] "But here's one consolation I have." He
[2:38:37] said, "When I find a few minutes to
[2:38:39] sleep, when I have my prayer before
[2:38:42] going to bed, I know this, that by God's
[2:38:45] grace, I've done the best that I could
[2:38:48] to make life a little better for my
[2:38:51] fellow man."
[2:38:53] He said another time
[2:38:55] he said, "It's to this end that I'm here
[2:39:00] to try to do that. To join hands with
[2:39:02] your doctor, to join hands with your
[2:39:05] chiropractor,
[2:39:07] with your surgeon, with your pastor,
[2:39:10] with your neighbor, and all try to make
[2:39:12] life just a little bit better."
[2:39:15] You know, there's a lot of people that
[2:39:17] Brother Brandham ministered to and did
[2:39:19] and made their life a little better that
[2:39:20] aren't going to heaven.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that he he tried
[2:39:24] to help that brand of people that maybe
[2:39:26] just will go through tribulation. He he
[2:39:29] [clears throat] didn't make any lines
[2:39:31] about that. He's just trying to make
[2:39:32] life better.
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[2:39:36] &gt;&gt; Make life easier. I think that children,
[2:39:38] whether they get born again or don't get
[2:39:40] born again, they're better to go to
[2:39:41] Sunday school. They're better to go to a
[2:39:44] Christian school if they can. They're
[2:39:46] better to go and and and hear the gospel
[2:39:48] of Jesus Christ. You that are sitting
[2:39:51] here in this watch night service. I'm
[2:39:53] saying this without any apology. This
[2:39:55] the best place you can sit tonight
[2:39:58] in this entire valley in this entire
[2:40:00] Northwest because you're hearing things
[2:40:02] that are absolutely true that the angel
[2:40:05] of God stood behind and the angel of God
[2:40:08] supernaturally proved it. Said that's
[2:40:10] true.
[2:40:12] And here we are tonight and we we've got
[2:40:15] such a privilege. And so I just say to
[2:40:16] you, I was young. I've been I've had a
[2:40:20] young family. I've had children, educate
[2:40:24] them, and they're here tonight.
[2:40:27] Grandchildren are here tonight.
[2:40:30] But you know, we just constantly tried
[2:40:33] to give somewhere.
[2:40:36] just give some help somewhere
[2:40:39] and give you yourself. And I want to say
[2:40:42] to this congregation,
[2:40:44] God bless you and bless you as you seek
[2:40:47] to give of yourself and just seek every
[2:40:51] area you can that you can find. Let your
[2:40:54] let your radar be out there and see who
[2:40:57] you can help and who you can bless. And
[2:41:00] I think that I I I really pray that you
[2:41:03] take those words very very seriously.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you one of the things that
[2:41:09] you'll face. People turn around and
[2:41:13] they'll almost envy you be because they
[2:41:16] see the blessing of God on you, but they
[2:41:18] don't know why the blessing's there.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to speak of just one
[2:41:23] family while I'm I'm here for this
[2:41:25] moment. I I I highly respect our sister
[2:41:28] Tracy and Brother
[2:41:33] Murphy.
[2:41:35] I told Brother Murphy I'd like to adopt
[2:41:37] him if he'd take the name Biscoll.
[2:41:41] He's got a family of his own was the
[2:41:43] same size as mine. And he's added other
[2:41:46] children and young people and Mary and
[2:41:49] Jason and the other sister here and and
[2:41:53] they're staying in their house. And
[2:41:56] they've just kept making their house
[2:41:58] bigger and and making more room for more
[2:42:02] people because not because it's easy,
[2:42:06] but because that's just
[2:42:09] there's really nothing else to do.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; You just do that.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; And when uh people read and they say,
[2:42:15] "Well, oh, Brother Ed, you worked
[2:42:17] amongst the native Indian people and and
[2:42:20] the native people." But when the native
[2:42:23] people came to Victoria and I lived in
[2:42:25] Victoria,
[2:42:27] uh, Brother Kyle, Sister Christine, I
[2:42:29] lived in Victoria and they felt welcome
[2:42:33] and they came and slept in the basement
[2:42:36] wherever there was room just like Cord
[2:42:38] would and and and I expected them to be
[2:42:41] there. I expected them because they were
[2:42:44] my friends. There were people that I and
[2:42:46] when I went and not one time, not one
[2:42:49] time in all the years that I went up
[2:42:53] there amongst them and the different
[2:42:55] reservations, not one time did I sleep
[2:42:58] in a motel or stay in a white man's
[2:43:00] house. I stayed with them every time and
[2:43:04] stayed in their place. My wife, I took
[2:43:07] her there and she stayed there and
[2:43:09] stayed in a three- room house for a few
[2:43:12] days of meetings and and there were 17
[2:43:15] people in the house, one bedroom, and my
[2:43:17] wife and I had the bedroom. Listen,
[2:43:20] friends, people know when they're
[2:43:22] welcome. People know I'm just not
[2:43:25] talking about hospitality, but this this
[2:43:27] church, even what it is right now, it's
[2:43:29] because it's been a giving church. If
[2:43:32] somebody wants a tape, get a tape to
[2:43:34] them. And I have another quote here.
[2:43:36] Brother Brando said, you know, uh, we
[2:43:38] got some books. Well, you know, and and
[2:43:40] we got some pictures and things and, uh,
[2:43:43] we sell them for just what we have to
[2:43:45] pay for them, but if you want them and
[2:43:47] you can't pay, don't worry about it. You
[2:43:49] you can just have it. And that's the way
[2:43:51] we've been.
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; And the people overseas, they know
[2:43:55] that's the way we've been. And if we can
[2:43:57] possibly do it, we just want to help
[2:43:59] them. I want that's been it's been up to
[2:44:02] 2013. And by God's grace, it'll continue
[2:44:05] in the coming years. Amen. God bless
[2:44:08] you.
[2:44:10] [applause]
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:44:20] Amen.
[2:44:22] Well, we probably better have another
[2:44:23] group come up. So, let's have uh Daryl
[2:44:26] and Mayan and Karen come up and get
[2:44:29] ready. Just after they're done singing,
[2:44:31] we'll have Jessica and Charity Caldwell
[2:44:33] and Andrew Rivas come up and sing.
[2:44:36] Amen. As they're coming, why don't we
[2:44:37] sing 1199? How deep the Father's love
[2:44:40] is. [music]
[2:44:44] How deep the Father's love for us.
[2:44:50] How blessed [music] beyond all measure
[2:44:55] that he should give his holy [music] son
[2:45:01] to make
[2:45:03] his treasure.

[2:46:15] filled with heartache [singing]
[2:46:17] and pain
[2:46:20] [music] and pray to
[2:46:22] the father
[2:46:24] to take them away. [music]
[2:46:29] Then I heard
[2:46:31] him whisper,
[2:46:34] "I'm always with you [music]
[2:46:38] and I hope tomorrow
[2:46:43] and I'll bring you [music] through.
[2:46:50] [music] Yesterday's
[2:46:52] trials
[2:46:54] give me strength [singing]
[2:46:55] for [music]
[2:46:57] today
[2:46:59] and serve to remind me that [music]
[2:47:04] he'll make a way.

[2:48:01] [singing] again say,
[2:48:05] [music]
[2:48:07] "Yesterday's
[2:48:09] trials. [singing]
[2:48:11] Give me strength [music] for today."
[2:48:16] and serve to [music]
[2:48:18] remind [singing] me that he'll make a
[2:48:22] way.

[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your
[2:56:34] seats once again.
[2:56:39] Amen.
[2:56:41] Well, just as they're getting ready,
[2:56:43] we'll one more second. All right. We've
[2:56:46] looked around the room. Have you looked
[2:56:47] around the room a little bit? Amen. It's
[2:56:50] good to be amongst friends.
[2:56:52] &gt;&gt; It's good to have our families around
[2:56:53] us.
[2:56:54] &gt;&gt; It's good to have the body of Christ.
[2:56:56] Each one is a very integral part.
[2:56:59] If you've uh gone without a member of
[2:57:02] your body very long, you realize very
[2:57:05] quickly that it's missing.
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[2:57:13] &gt;&gt; Try and go to work without being able to
[2:57:14] use your arm because it's bundled up
[2:57:16] because you've heard it. The other one
[2:57:18] has to do a lot of extra work.
[2:57:21] There's a lot of pain and suffering that
[2:57:23] happens when part of the body is
[2:57:24] missing. I see you're smiling, Brother
[2:57:27] James. It's good. It's good to have you
[2:57:29] back.
[2:57:31] Understand brother Joseph is packed and
[2:57:33] is heading down to Louisiana, but we
[2:57:36] understand those things. But it's good
[2:57:38] to have each one of you here.
[2:57:41] Bless you, brother Jeff.
[2:57:44] From the camp, we express our
[2:57:45] appreciation for a very wonderful year
[2:57:48] out of Mount Baker Bible Way Camp. The
[2:57:51] Lord has really, really blessed the
[2:57:52] camp. How many have been able to enjoy
[2:57:55] going out to the camp? I would like more
[2:57:57] of you to enjoy that. And I mean that
[2:58:00] sincerely. And I don't mean to come out
[2:58:02] and volunteer.
[2:58:04] Brother Steven came all the way from
[2:58:05] Grand Prairie to come and stay in a
[2:58:07] cabin for a couple of nights. Shame on
[2:58:08] us if we live close
[2:58:11] and we don't go out and enjoy the camp.
[2:58:13] The Lord's given it
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; to the body of Christ for the body of
[2:58:18] Christ. Amen. We should use it thus.
[2:58:21] There's a lot of uh other churches that
[2:58:23] get to use the camp. There's a lot of
[2:58:24] other youth groups that get to enjoy the
[2:58:26] camp. I think it would be a shame if we
[2:58:28] don't enjoy the camp.
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We look forward to
[2:58:32] another wonderful year serving the body.
[2:58:36] Amen.
[2:58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:58:39] Well,
[2:58:41] almost at the end of a year, I think
[2:58:42] maybe
[2:58:44] we will cross over during our song.
[2:58:49] It's been a wonderful year. But uh this
[2:58:52] little this song is a one of one of my
[2:58:54] favorites and I think it's a a for me
[2:58:57] it's a song that I'm privileged I can
[2:58:59] sing at the close of 2012. Uh it's how
[2:59:02] can we say thanks for the things that
[2:59:04] the Lord has done for us. And uh we I
[2:59:08] lassued my my aunts to sing backup for
[2:59:10] me. So forgive them if it's a if we uh
[2:59:14] you know bumble around a little bit but
[2:59:17] but it's only to give the glory to our
[2:59:18] Lord. And so uh maybe at the end if uh
[2:59:22] you can join in this very simple course
[2:59:23] and I'm sure many of you have heard it
[2:59:25] before. So hopefully it blesses you.
[2:59:38] [music]
[2:59:47] How
[2:59:48] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:59:49] &gt;&gt; Can I say thanks

[3:00:17] The voices [music and singing]

[3:00:23] [music] could not express
[3:00:27] my gratitude. [music]
[3:00:31] All that I am and ever hope to [music]
[3:00:35] be.

[3:04:55] Can you praise him tonight?
[3:04:58] Can you open up your mouth tonight? This
[3:04:59] is your time. This is your time to
[3:05:02] praise him. Glory. Let our praises ring.
[3:05:08] [applause]
[3:05:09] Hallelujah.
[3:05:14] Glory. We thank him.
[3:05:19] Thank him for his word. Thank him for
[3:05:21] his presence. Thank him for his spirit.
[3:05:23] Thank him for what he's done for you
[3:05:24] this past year. Thank him for what he's
[3:05:27] going to do for you in this next year.
[3:05:29] &gt;&gt; There's a rapture to attain, saints.
[3:05:32] &gt;&gt; We're just crossing over.
[3:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[3:05:37] &gt;&gt; We want to praise him. We want to thank
[3:05:39] him.
[3:05:40] Just think, just think, just think,
[3:05:41] saints of God, if God hadn't come by
[3:05:44] with this resurrected message for you,
[3:05:46] you would be in some church somewhere,
[3:05:49] maybe in some pub somewhere, hitting
[3:05:52] some pans and pots together. I don't
[3:05:54] know what that means, but by the grace
[3:05:57] of God here, you're in the house of God
[3:05:59] with the redeemed of God.
[3:06:02] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[3:06:04] We're with the saints from Seattle.
[3:06:13] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:06:13] &gt;&gt; from
[3:06:19] the Philippines,
[3:06:21] from Canada, US. [applause]
[3:06:27] Heaven has come down amongst us.
[3:06:31] Glory [applause]
[3:06:38] My heart is filled.
[3:06:40] &gt;&gt; My heart is filled to see the ones that
[3:06:42] have have sung tonight, the brothers
[3:06:44] that have spoken tonight and those that
[3:06:47] have prepared and will not be singing
[3:06:48] tonight. You will be singing.
[3:06:51] &gt;&gt; There we do have other services.
[3:06:54] So don't you worry. But I want you to
[3:06:57] appreciate what is around you.
[3:06:59] &gt;&gt; I want you to look at one another and
[3:07:01] say, "That's the redeemed of God. God
[3:07:03] died on a cross for my brother, my
[3:07:05] sister. I want to appreciate them more
[3:07:08] in 2013.
[3:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:07:15] &gt;&gt; May have your seats. I'm just going to
[3:07:18] be a few minutes.
[3:07:21] And if you want to if you want to stand
[3:07:23] when I whatever I'm saying and you want
[3:07:25] to lift up your hand, Brother Bren, I
[3:07:27] just heard him the other day. He said,
[3:07:28] "Where are those days?" He said, "When
[3:07:30] you come to church and the Holy Spirit
[3:07:32] speaks to the brother and he just raises
[3:07:34] to his feet and lift up his hand, walks
[3:07:36] down the aisle and sits back down." He
[3:07:38] says, "We need that Holy Spirit again."
[3:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Psalms
[3:07:50] 104,
[3:07:52] "Enter into his gates
[3:07:55] with thanksgiving
[3:07:57] and into his courts
[3:07:59] with praise. Be thankful unto him and
[3:08:04] bless his name."
[3:08:07] What I saw tonight was a thanksgiving
[3:08:12] &gt;&gt; for the thanksgiving.
[3:08:15] &gt;&gt; What I see tonight
[3:08:17] &gt;&gt; is the thanksgiving
[3:08:19] for the thanksgiving.
[3:08:21] &gt;&gt; And I am thankful for what Christ has
[3:08:24] done in every one of your lives.
[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:28] &gt;&gt; I am deeply appreciated to my lovely
[3:08:30] Lord Jesus for your lives and how it's
[3:08:34] impacted me. Amen.
[3:08:38] &gt;&gt; I want to give God thanks tonight.
[3:08:42] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you for your kindness. I
[3:08:44] want to thank you for your generosity.
[3:08:47] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you for your giving,
[3:08:48] your cards, your emails, your letters,
[3:08:52] your prayers, your encouragement for
[3:08:55] myself and my dear wife, for my family
[3:08:58] which you are. I want to thank God for
[3:09:01] every one of you. Amen.
[3:09:04] &gt;&gt; I thank God
[3:09:06] for a visionary
[3:09:08] man of God, father in the faith,
[3:09:12] &gt;&gt; my pastor, your pastor. I thank God for
[3:09:15] the man of God.
[3:09:17] [applause]
[3:09:20] &gt;&gt; Let's enter his church with thanksgiving
[3:09:22] and praise.
[3:09:25] [applause]
[3:09:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a year.
[3:09:28] What an unvealing. What a word.
[3:09:32] What a blessing.
[3:09:34] [applause]
[3:09:36] Glory.
[3:09:40] [applause]
[3:09:40] Hallelujah.
[3:09:45] I will never ever be able to express
[3:09:47] through the eternities my thanksgiving.
[3:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:55] &gt;&gt; I thank God for raising young men such
[3:09:57] as brother Kyla. I thank God for raising
[3:10:01] up brother Peter Ivanko and he couldn't
[3:10:03] be here tonight to greet you. So I want
[3:10:05] to greet you on his behalf. I want to
[3:10:07] greet you on brother Kelly
[3:10:08] Hildbrerbrand's pastor in Grandthal
[3:10:11] Saskatchewan. He wanted me to pass along
[3:10:13] his loving greetings. I talked to
[3:10:15] brother Jason Watkins also. These are
[3:10:18] brothers. These are precious brothers of
[3:10:19] the gospel. I'm thankful for their
[3:10:21] lives.
[3:10:22] I am thankful for the burden that you
[3:10:26] had, brother Kyle, to see what we saw
[3:10:30] tonight and what we'll continue to see.
[3:10:32] &gt;&gt; I never thought that I would be in the
[3:10:34] Bible like that. The travels of St.
[3:10:37] Thomas.
[3:10:40] I don't have that quite in my Cambridge
[3:10:42] Bible. Maybe you want to send them that
[3:10:44] map.
[3:10:47] But I wanted to say the other day,
[3:10:48] saints, listen, when we say the word
[3:10:49] saints and you stood and and you stood
[3:10:52] up in appreciation for what God's done
[3:10:54] for you last Sunday.
[3:10:56] To make a saint in the Catholic Church,
[3:10:58] there has to be one miracle within their
[3:11:00] lives.
[3:11:02] &gt;&gt; And sometimes they take five or seven or
[3:11:04] 15 years trying to find a miracle within
[3:11:08] their lives so that they can be a saint.
[3:11:11] I want to tell you, you are the miracle
[3:11:13] and you are the living saint of the
[3:11:16] Bible.
[3:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:21] &gt;&gt; I don't have to look five years. I see
[3:11:23] it from service to service. How the Holy
[3:11:25] Spirit delivers, sets free,
[3:11:28] &gt;&gt; heals, and touches and saves. I say to
[3:11:30] God be the glory.
[3:11:31] &gt;&gt; Great things he has done.
[3:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:36] I want to thank God
[3:11:40] and I've had the privilege
[3:11:44] to be associated with the caliber
[3:11:48] of brothers that handle the word of God
[3:11:51] here at Cloverdale Bible Way.
[3:11:53] &gt;&gt; You have got brother John Andes. You
[3:11:55] have got brother Murphy. You got brother
[3:11:57] Timothy Maul. You have brother Ken
[3:11:59] Andes. You have brother Ernie Vil Noea.
[3:12:02] We've got brother Dominic that God is
[3:12:03] starting to use. and and move amongst
[3:12:05] us. Brother Tim Dodd has felt led to
[3:12:08] come and help us and soldiering with us
[3:12:10] here in Cloverdale. I thank God for
[3:12:12] these God called men,
[3:12:19] &gt;&gt; for wonderful deacons,
[3:12:24] &gt;&gt; for trustees that care for this church,
[3:12:28] &gt;&gt; that give of their time many hours. I
[3:12:32] thank God for their labors. For those
[3:12:34] that labor in the office that are it's
[3:12:36] hardly mentioned, but they are the ones
[3:12:39] that have kept this like it's it's it's
[3:12:41] just wonderful to see the gifts
[3:12:43] operating in the body and seeing how
[3:12:45] that God had put within the church and
[3:12:48] we hardly even recognize them. But Sarah
[3:12:50] who puts in so much,
[3:12:52] &gt;&gt; we thank God for sister Sarah Ash.
[3:12:57] [applause]
[3:13:02] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:13:04] &gt;&gt; not just say anything of sister Debbie
[3:13:07] and the years the years she has put in
[3:13:09] the church and brother Aaron and brother
[3:13:11] Michael. [applause] Praise the Lord.
[3:13:13] Brother Alex, God bless you. Thank you.
[3:13:16] Thank you. I am humbled.
[3:13:20] I am humbled that that man picks up my
[3:13:22] Kleenex.
[3:13:25] &gt;&gt; I'm humbled, Alex. And I thank God for
[3:13:28] you.
[3:13:29] &gt;&gt; I love you, too.
[3:13:33] Every volunteer that helps at our camps,
[3:13:37] every one of you that did just one
[3:13:39] little thing. And we've had the
[3:13:42] privilege to baptize over 250 of our
[3:13:45] young people over the years. I say to
[3:13:47] God,
[3:13:48] &gt;&gt; be the glory.
[3:13:50] &gt;&gt; Great things he has done. [applause]
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; Praise him. Thank him.
[3:13:58] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:14:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Derek and Sister Debbie and what
[3:14:02] they've done and and all the sisters
[3:14:04] that have helped and labored and worked
[3:14:05] over the years. It it it's been
[3:14:08] marvelous to see every volunteer, every
[3:14:10] laborer in every area. I give you my
[3:14:14] humble appreciation for all you've done
[3:14:16] for the gospel. Means so much to me.
[3:14:20] &gt;&gt; We will hold this banner high. Amen.
[3:14:24] &gt;&gt; We will not let it fall to the ground.
[3:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:29] &gt;&gt; Thankful indeed. I am. The Bible says in
[3:14:33] Philippians 4 and4,
[3:14:35] &gt;&gt; rejoice in the Lord always and I say
[3:14:40] rejoice.
[3:14:44] &gt;&gt; I rejoice in the Lord in the good times.
[3:14:49] &gt;&gt; And again I say rejoice. I say we will
[3:14:52] rejoice in the bad times.
[3:14:54] &gt;&gt; Then I say again to you the church,
[3:14:56] let's rejoice.
[3:14:58] &gt;&gt; Good times, bad times.
[3:15:00] &gt;&gt; We are going through.
[3:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15:05] &gt;&gt; You know what the Bible says in Matthew
[3:15:07] 2 and 10? When the wise men saw the
[3:15:10] star,
[3:15:11] you know what the Bible says? When they
[3:15:13] saw the star, they
[3:15:17] &gt;&gt; rejoiced. And I'm saying tonight because
[3:15:20] I saw the seventh star
[3:15:23] &gt;&gt; in the hand of God
[3:15:25] &gt;&gt; and that word is creating in me a new
[3:15:29] body.
[3:15:30] &gt;&gt; I want to say praise be to God.
[3:15:33] &gt;&gt; Could God be the glory great things he's
[3:15:36] not only done but he is doing now and
[3:15:38] will do.
[3:15:40] &gt;&gt; Have you rejoiced
[3:15:42] &gt;&gt; to see the star?
[3:15:47] 1 Thessalonians 5:16. We're 50 14
[3:15:50] minutes into the new year
[3:15:54] and the world is just starting.
[3:15:58] &gt;&gt; But I do understand we are not children
[3:16:00] of the night.
[3:16:02] &gt;&gt; We're children of the day and I
[3:16:04] understand that. And so I will not hold
[3:16:07] you much longer.
[3:16:11] 1 Thessalonians 5:16 says, "Rejoice
[3:16:17] evermore."
[3:16:20] &gt;&gt; Then I ask you tonight, what are we
[3:16:22] rejoicing in?
[3:16:24] &gt;&gt; Watchmen,
[3:16:25] what of the night?
[3:16:28] &gt;&gt; It's dark here, Brother Tom. And it's
[3:16:31] gloomy, Brother Tom. And I can barely
[3:16:33] put up with what's out there. Brother
[3:16:35] Bram says, "Hey, you're always saying
[3:16:38] how dark it is." and how bad it is. He
[3:16:42] says, "Don't you see how bright it's
[3:16:44] getting
[3:16:45] &gt;&gt; and how powerful the church is getting?"
[3:16:49] &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise God,
[3:16:51] &gt;&gt; watchmen, what are the night?" Hey, it's
[3:16:54] the rising of the sun.
[3:16:57] &gt;&gt; It's the great emancipation.
[3:17:01] &gt;&gt; It's our deliverance that has come.
[3:17:03] &gt;&gt; And so I say to you tonight, can we
[3:17:05] rejoice
[3:17:06] &gt;&gt; in God's messenger?
[3:17:09] Can we rejoice in the message?
[3:17:11] &gt;&gt; Can we rejoice in the word of God?
[3:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this message makes Christ
[3:17:16] alive.
[3:17:28] At the time when a people can actually
[3:17:31] say, "Give me that book."
[3:17:34] &gt;&gt; Can you rejoice tonight
[3:17:36] &gt;&gt; knowing that brother Bram said when you
[3:17:38] have taken the abstract title deed,
[3:17:46] &gt;&gt; when you've taken that title deed and
[3:17:50] you have possessed the abstract, are you
[3:17:54] ready?
[3:17:55] All your sins are gone.
[3:18:00] &gt;&gt; Can you rejoice tonight? Because the
[3:18:03] devil wants you to look back and see all
[3:18:05] your failures, but the word of God wants
[3:18:07] to see the victory that is in the
[3:18:10] revealing of the word.
[3:18:13] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[3:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The abstract, all sins are gone.
[3:18:20] Your sins are struck out. and the blood
[3:18:22] of Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost as an
[3:18:25] abstract to the title that God give me
[3:18:28] by grace by fornowledge. Oh my.
[3:18:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[3:18:33] &gt;&gt; The abstract title deed. This is going
[3:18:36] to now come down to the close so that
[3:18:38] you can rejoice. The abstract title deed
[3:18:42] means your debt is settled forever.
[3:18:51] Amen.
[3:18:52] &gt;&gt; Saints, listen.
[3:18:54] &gt;&gt; Because Satan will come to you and he
[3:18:57] will point back to every one of your
[3:19:01] failures and mistakes
[3:19:03] &gt;&gt; and he is very good for that. But I want
[3:19:06] you to take first John 1
[3:19:08] &gt;&gt; where it says that the blood of Jesus
[3:19:12] Christ
[3:19:13] &gt;&gt; cleanses me from
[3:19:17] &gt;&gt; all sle.
[3:19:22] &gt;&gt; I say again,
[3:19:25] &gt;&gt; rejoice.
[3:19:27] rejoice in what God has blessed us with
[3:19:30] this year and what he will continue to
[3:19:33] do in the year ahead.
[3:19:36] I wanted to actually speak on the
[3:19:39] bride's revival.
[3:19:41] &gt;&gt; And Lord willing, next time I minister,
[3:19:44] I want to minister on this is the
[3:19:48] bride's revival.
[3:19:50] &gt;&gt; And I say to you again, rejoice because
[3:19:53] the word of God has been open to you.
[3:19:55] And you are a possessor of that abstract
[3:19:58] title. All your sins are gone. Your debt
[3:20:01] is paid. And you can say tonight, I am
[3:20:04] free, free, free.
[3:20:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:20:10] [applause]
[3:20:17] [applause]
[3:20:19] &gt;&gt; Last scripture. This one, you can
[3:20:21] rejoice with me. This one put a smile on
[3:20:24] every one of your faces. This one,
[3:20:26] you're going to go out of the church of
[3:20:28] God tonight rejoicing
[3:20:30] because you are an abstract holder, a
[3:20:33] title deed holder.
[3:20:35] My Bible says, and your Bible says this
[3:20:37] in Hebrews 13:5,
[3:20:40] "Let your conversation be without
[3:20:42] covetousness. Be content with such
[3:20:44] things as you have. For he has said, for
[3:20:48] he has said,
[3:20:50] &gt;&gt; I will never leave thee,
[3:20:52] &gt;&gt; nor forsake thee."
[3:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you rejoice tonight?
[3:21:01] [applause]
[3:21:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:21:06] What a promise of a work.
[3:21:08] &gt;&gt; Drive darkness away, won't it? Watchmen,
[3:21:10] what of the night? My Bible says, I will
[3:21:13] never leave you. I will never forsake
[3:21:16] you.
[3:21:17] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my helper, and I will not
[3:21:20] fear what men will do to me.
[3:21:23] &gt;&gt; I say, praise be to God. That's good
[3:21:25] scripture for you.
[3:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the Bible. Are you ready
[3:21:31] for now another translation? Maybe help
[3:21:33] you to put a smile on your face at the
[3:21:35] end of this time.
[3:21:37] He God himself has said, "I will not in
[3:21:42] any way fail you nor give you up nor
[3:21:45] leave you without support. I will not.
[3:21:50] &gt;&gt; I will not."
[3:21:52] &gt;&gt; I will not. Can you imagine a
[3:21:54] translation putting that down three
[3:21:55] times because it's got to be in the
[3:21:57] mouth of two or three witnesses?
[3:21:59] &gt;&gt; The word of God is saying to you, I will
[3:22:01] not I will not I will not ever forsake
[3:22:05] you.
[3:22:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, believers. God bless
[3:22:12] you for doing your part.
[3:22:16] &gt;&gt; Then I say to you tonight, let's press
[3:22:19] the battle like we've never pressed
[3:22:20] before. Let's run the race like we've
[3:22:23] never run before.
[3:22:25] &gt;&gt; Let's take up the charge that has been
[3:22:27] given us tonight from these faithful
[3:22:29] brethren. Let's hold the word dear to
[3:22:32] our hearts. Let's go on and say,
[3:22:35] "Onward, Christian soldier."
[3:22:39] &gt;&gt; Please stand with me.
[3:22:47] Musicians as they come.
[3:22:53] to thank him individually. Now, as we go
[3:22:57] to prayer and close the service, I'm
[3:22:59] going to ask brother Ken Andes to come.
[3:23:03] We missed you at the very beginning, so
[3:23:04] we're not going to miss you tonight.
[3:23:08] Brother Ken, you are on my minister's
[3:23:10] list of appreciation
[3:23:12] to thank you for your labors for many
[3:23:13] years.
[3:23:15] &gt;&gt; I still have the books. I will never put
[3:23:19] them down by the grace of God. And when
[3:23:21] I re when I read them, I think of you
[3:23:23] often
[3:23:24] &gt;&gt; and I thank God for you.
[3:23:28] &gt;&gt; Can we lift up our hands
[3:23:32] &gt;&gt; and in your own way?
[3:23:35] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord
[3:23:37] &gt;&gt; coming into his courts
[3:23:40] &gt;&gt; with thanksgiving. To God
[3:23:44] be the glory.
[3:23:48] To God
[3:23:51] be the glory. [music]
[3:23:55] To God
[3:23:58] be the glory.

[3:24:48] Let us pray. [music]
[3:24:53] &gt;&gt; Our loving heavenly father,
[3:24:57] our hearts are humbled tonight, [music]
[3:25:00] having you in our presence and allowing
[3:25:03] us to be in your presence [music] with
[3:25:06] this promise that's just been said, you
[3:25:09] will never leave us. He will never
[3:25:12] [music] forsake us. And Lord Jesus, as
[3:25:15] the world is counting down the seconds
[3:25:19] and moments even into another time zone,
[3:25:21] it'll be the same for a 24-hour period
[3:25:24] until they've lapsed into a another day.
[3:25:28] As they say, you spiritually have
[3:25:31] [music] completed a countdown.
[3:25:34] We have seen that countdown in our lives
[3:25:37] and throughout the bride of Jesus
[3:25:39] Christ. And we are living in that last
[3:25:43] count [music] in that seventh move of
[3:25:47] your spirit.
[3:25:49] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, I pray that what's been
[3:25:52] done tonight, spoken tonight, and that
[3:25:55] is in our hearts from the previous years
[3:25:58] that you've worked and built up, for you
[3:26:00] know them that are yours.
[3:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] and you are able to bring
[3:26:04] to completion in each life your desired
[3:26:07] purpose. We marvel how you are building
[3:26:11] your church. We marvel how you know
[3:26:14] every individual
[3:26:16] &gt;&gt; and bringing to pass the perfection so
[3:26:20] that there will not be one lost and one
[3:26:23] will not fail. [music] but what they
[3:26:26] will remain in your hand and in your
[3:26:28] kingdom always in that heavenly [music]
[3:26:31] kingdom.
[3:26:33] &gt;&gt; I pray heavenly father as has already
[3:26:35] been spoken tonight that your blessing
[3:26:37] will continue upon the bride universal
[3:26:40] upon every son and daughter of yours
[3:26:42] that we are so much kin to and a part
[3:26:46] of. [music] continue to bless your
[3:26:48] ministers worldwide as they declare your
[3:26:52] gospel [music] without fear, favor,
[3:26:55] compromise.
[3:26:56] Refill us with your Holy Spirit. Lord,
[3:27:00] may the dynamics of your life within us,
[3:27:03] within this assembly, within the
[3:27:05] ministers of this assembly, [music]
[3:27:07] that every man and woman, boy, and girl
[3:27:10] will feel the impact and the [music]
[3:27:14] infusion
[3:27:15] of your presence in our lives. and truly
[3:27:19] that we can go forth in this coming year
[3:27:22] [music] to be a witness to be a life
[3:27:24] lived out and spent and spilled out to
[3:27:29] the hungry and needy. Lord Jesus, in
[3:27:32] your hands we commend and give our
[3:27:34] spirits, [music]
[3:27:36] our souls, our bodies, our minds, and
[3:27:39] all that we are into your presence.
[3:27:41] Lord, [music]
[3:27:42] may your perfect will be done in and
[3:27:44] through this portion of your body and
[3:27:48] those that look this way through the
[3:27:50] internet.
