[12:04] grace. We don't have any requests
[12:06] written down, but we want to remember
[12:07] the Dodd's family. You mentioned the
[12:09] request this morning. Brother Edwin's
[12:12] sister passing on and just that Lord

[12:33] lift our hands, lift our hearts to you,
[12:35] and worship you, oh God.
[12:38] Satan, you are defeated.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Whatever
[12:43] you've come to do tonight, you're
[12:44] defeated.
[12:46] We're standing on the word of God. I
[12:48] know there are needs amongst us. Once
[12:52] again, Satan, you are defeated.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; We are standing on those problem
[12:56] promises, God. We just want to give you
[12:59] thanks, give you glory. Just asking God
[13:02] that you'll take the rest of the song
[13:03] service, the rest of the worship.

[24:47] [Music]
[24:59] [Music]
[25:07] Let's just have prayer.
[25:11] We are so privileged, Lord God, to be
[25:16] able to approach you that we have a
[25:19] channel open. And as your prophet and
[25:22] messenger declared how Job had a
[25:25] channel, he had an avenue, a channel by
[25:28] revelation,
[25:30] we know that you have revealed yourself
[25:33] to us. Lord, we would certainly not
[25:36] know. We could not understand the things
[25:39] that you have caused us to know. You
[25:43] have made yourself known.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; You've made the scriptures clear. It is
[25:48] though you have directed our thoughts
[25:50] and taken command of our minds and have
[25:54] said to us as your children, you shall
[25:56] know these things. You shall know the
[25:59] truth and the truth shall set you free.
[26:02] Lord, we have such a positive promise
[26:06] and we stand there firmly with our feet,
[26:09] oh God, established upon the covenant
[26:13] that you have made. You're not a man
[26:15] that you can lie. You shall fulfill
[26:18] every word that you have promised to
[26:21] your children. This evening, Lord, we've
[26:24] come to worship not only with in song
[26:27] and with our lips, but we've come to
[26:30] worship you with our lives and our
[26:32] presence here. And we pray that your
[26:35] presence will overshadow us and flow
[26:39] around us and permeate us through and
[26:42] through. And we want to glorify you. All
[26:47] glory to the name of Jesus Christ.
[26:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[26:54] Hallelu.
[26:55] Hallelujah.
[26:57] We praise you, Lord. We praise you,
[27:00] Lord. You're worthy. You're the only
[27:03] worthy one.
[27:05] We give glory to you, oh God.
[27:09] Thank you for redemption.
[27:12] Thank you for Calvary where the
[27:13] serpent's head was crushed.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; We have that victory tonight.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to your name.
[27:22] Illuminate us now, Lord, as we read your
[27:25] word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[27:29] God bless you. If you have your Bibles,
[27:34] we're going to turn to Exodus the 3
[27:36] chapter.
[27:38] and
[27:40] this morning speaking
[27:42] uh
[27:44] reading and speaking from first Peter.
[27:47] We won't read there, but just while
[27:49] you're turning to Exodus 3,
[27:52] the verse I took my text from was, "But
[27:55] you are a chosen generation
[27:58] and a royal priesthood,
[28:01] a holy nation, a peculiar people, that
[28:05] you should show forth the praises of him
[28:10] who hath called you out of darkness into
[28:12] his marvelous light." That's our purpose
[28:15] in life.
[28:16] And this is a holy nation. And I have
[28:20] inserted in there a holy
[28:24] resourcerich
[28:26] nation.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; We are resourceri
[28:31] might be that we need to develop some of
[28:33] these resources.
[28:35] Might need we need to refine some of
[28:37] them.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; But we are resourcerich. Now, I'm going
[28:42] to read in Exodus, and we're having
[28:44] baptism tonight as well. Two of our
[28:47] precious young people are being
[28:49] baptized,
[28:51] and uh we're so happy about that.
[28:56] Exodus uh 3. Now, what we're going to do
[28:59] is I'm going to just read a few verses
[29:03] and then if you'll keep your Bible open,
[29:05] you may want to refer back to it. Uh
[29:08] I'll start with verse one.
[29:12] And we'll read down to verse four. And
[29:13] then we'll go to verse 10.
[29:16] Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his
[29:19] father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And
[29:22] he led the flock on to the backside of
[29:25] the desert, and came to the mountain of
[29:27] God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the
[29:31] Lord appeared unto him in a flame of
[29:33] fire, out of the midst of a bush. And he
[29:37] looked, and behold, the bush burned with
[29:39] fire, and the bush was not consumed. And
[29:43] Moses said, "I will turn now aside. I
[29:46] will now turn aside and see this great
[29:50] sight why the bush is not burnt." And
[29:53] when the Lord saw that he turned aside
[29:55] to see, God called him unto him out of
[29:59] the midst of the bush and said, "Moses,
[30:02] Moses." And he said, "Here am I." Verse
[30:06] 10. Come now therefore, and I will send
[30:10] thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest
[30:12] bring forth my people, the children of
[30:14] Israel, out of Egypt. And Moses said
[30:17] unto God, Who am I that I should go unto
[30:22] Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth
[30:24] the children of Israel out of Egypt? And
[30:27] he said, Certainly, I will be with thee,
[30:30] and this shall be a token unto thee,
[30:33] that I have sent thee, when thou hast
[30:36] brought forth the people out of Egypt,
[30:39] you shall serve God upon this mountain.
[30:42] And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I
[30:45] come unto the children of Israel, and
[30:48] shall say unto them, the God of your
[30:50] fathers hath sent me unto you, and they
[30:53] shall say to me, What is his name? What
[30:56] shall I say unto them? And God said unto
[30:59] Moses, I am that I am. And he said, thou
[31:05] thus shalt thou say unto the children of
[31:07] Israel, I am hath sent me unto you. And
[31:12] amen. God bless you as you have your
[31:15] seats.
[31:21] When we speak of resources, we speak of
[31:23] of potentials.
[31:28] Brother Brandham said, and I'll give the
[31:29] quote later on,
[31:33] he said that the burning bush had what
[31:36] Moses lacked.
[31:40] So the potentials
[31:44] uh Moses had certain potentials but they
[31:48] needed to be developed
[31:50] by what was in the burning bush.
[31:53] I don't know just exactly how
[31:57] uh to bring it to you and I don't know
[31:59] exactly how God will deal with you in
[32:03] trying to comprehend and recognize that
[32:06] the very one that was in that burning
[32:09] bush was in Houston, Texas
[32:14] allowed his photograph to be taken
[32:16] &gt;&gt; the same pillar of fire for a third
[32:19] exodus in this generation
[32:22] And as Moses said, I'll turn aside now
[32:25] and see this one day something touched
[32:28] you. And you said, I haven't heard
[32:31] anything like this. I haven't seen
[32:33] anything like I haven't seen this kind
[32:35] of manifestation. Haven't seen this kind
[32:37] of people. I I I I'm going to turn aside
[32:40] now. And you turned aside and something
[32:43] began to speak to you.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Something began to get you.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; I looked down our brother Peter Girtson.
[32:49] He drove past and saw some children from
[32:52] the school playing in the parking lot
[32:55] and something caught him. Said, "I
[32:58] haven't seen that. I haven't seen girls
[33:01] dressed like those young girls are."
[33:03] Something caught him and from that time
[33:06] it's been different
[33:10] &gt;&gt; for you. something caught a hold of you
[33:13] and you saw something and you turned
[33:16] aside for a moment said I will look and
[33:19] see what this sight is and to every seed
[33:22] of God once you turned aside
[33:26] and that which caught your attention
[33:30] had what you needed.
[33:33] And that same pillar of fire was not
[33:36] merely in the burning bush on the back
[33:38] side of the desert near the mount of God
[33:40] of Horeb was not merely in Houston,
[33:44] Texas and photographed
[33:46] but and and I don't want you to take
[33:48] this lightly. That same pillar of fire,
[33:51] that very presence, that very
[33:53] intelligence that spoke to Moses is
[33:56] right here in this building.
[33:59] And if you can believe that, if you can
[34:02] lay hold of that and say, "Oh, God, I
[34:06] believe that with all that's in me, God
[34:08] will do something for you."
[34:11] And this just may be a night that God
[34:14] wants to begin moving in your own life
[34:17] and move you further.
[34:19] A a potential
[34:24] is something that is has capacity.
[34:28] The encyclopedia says it's having
[34:32] potential is having capacity
[34:35] for existence.
[34:38] May not exist at this present moment,
[34:40] but it has capacity
[34:43] for existence to exist.
[34:46] It's a potential. potential is something
[34:48] that's possible but it hasn't it's not
[34:52] actual yet. It isn't it hasn't come into
[34:55] being yet but it has it has the uh
[35:00] capacity
[35:01] and there may be things that are as I
[35:04] speak you might feel that's beyond me.
[35:07] Uh you know
[35:10] I I' I'd like to believe that. I'd
[35:12] really do I do believe it but I just
[35:14] don't know if I can grasp it. I don't
[35:16] know if I can uh apprehend it. Well,
[35:21] there are things that Paul, he said that
[35:24] he was pressing toward the mark. He was
[35:26] saying that he wanted to apprehend that
[35:30] for which he had been apprehended. He
[35:32] wanted to seize that. And he would not
[35:35] be saying that if he had already seized
[35:37] it. So he said, "It's out there. It's
[35:39] beyond me. But I am not stopping. I am
[35:43] reaching forward. I am laying hold. I am
[35:46] believing that and I will lay hold of it
[35:49] and apprehend it. Apprehend means you
[35:52] don't just take a hold of it and let go
[35:53] of it. You apprehend these police
[35:56] brothers. They apprehend a prisoner.
[35:58] They secure him and bring him to
[36:01] wherever they're they plan to uh you
[36:04] know take him. Well, that's exactly you
[36:06] have been apprehended and uh and we want
[36:09] to apprehend that for which we have been
[36:12] apprehended. Amen.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Uh I I also would like to just make this
[36:17] general comment.
[36:19] I don't think there's anything wrong
[36:21] with aiming high.
[36:25] And I don't think that there's anything
[36:26] wrong with aiming too high. I don't know
[36:29] if a person can aim too high. I remember
[36:33] once back in the log church a lot of
[36:35] years ago brother from
[36:39] uh Port Elizabeth I believe it was Cape
[36:41] Town or Cape Town South Africa and he
[36:45] said I'm not going to die and you just
[36:49] feel a little hush go over the
[36:50] congregation and he stopped he said
[36:53] don't you know
[36:56] don't don't do that you know don't don't
[36:59] uh discredit my faith you know if I want
[37:02] to believe that. Well, then the people
[37:04] caught themselves and I think said quite
[37:07] an affirmative amen. If if he could lay
[37:10] hold of that, we say God bless him.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; And I think we ought to be able to lay
[37:15] hold of things that
[37:17] are high goals.
[37:22] Now
[37:24] we began to speak or we were speaking
[37:26] this morning and we got to that part of
[37:30] um the potentials that are within us. Uh
[37:35] now
[37:37] I spoke on and closed on the potentials
[37:40] we have for for unity.
[37:44] I'm going to take about two or three
[37:46] others, but I would like to just go back
[37:49] and speak about uh the body of Christ
[37:52] and some scriptures that we have
[37:55] concerning the body of Christ.
[37:57] Uh
[37:59] Paul said in Corinthians, the cup of
[38:01] blessing which we bless, is it not the
[38:04] communion of the blood of Christ and the
[38:07] bread which we break? Is it not the
[38:10] communion of the body of Christ? And I
[38:13] feel I would really like to stress this
[38:15] point this evening, you know, as a as a
[38:18] beginning place and take you back to
[38:21] this morning's service. uh there are so
[38:24] many homes and so many workplaces
[38:28] that today I think we've become
[38:31] accustomed whether it be the school that
[38:34] the young people go to or the place of
[38:37] work where you brothers work sisters
[38:40] some of your sisters are working out in
[38:42] the workplace uh there are
[38:46] homes and families and I don't think I'm
[38:49] describing uh the homes that are here in
[38:52] the church, but it could be where we get
[38:55] so taken up uh timewise. We get taken up
[39:00] interest wise, our interests are
[39:02] different. And the husband, he's he he's
[39:05] taken up and consumed with his circle of
[39:08] responsibility and so on. And and uh the
[39:10] wife, she's doing her thing, and the
[39:13] children are each doing their thing, and
[39:15] everybody's kind of going their own way.
[39:17] and the house uh ends up being kind of a
[39:20] a mutual meeting place where we grab a
[39:23] bite to eat, sleep for a little while,
[39:25] and then we're we're going our own
[39:27] direction. Uh I don't think that is
[39:30] really now I realize that you know
[39:32] that's a part of our uh a part of our
[39:34] age and I'm going to comment on that for
[39:37] I'm going to take a part of this service
[39:38] about that just a little later on. But
[39:40] you know what I mean when they when I
[39:42] refer to a house just being a place
[39:44] where people go through their own little
[39:47] orbits and then are are out doing their
[39:50] own thing. And the church can be the
[39:51] same thing. You know, we have our own uh
[39:54] our own activities and we have our own
[39:57] little life and we have uh uh we become
[39:59] just a whole uh several hundred
[40:02] individuals and we rotate in our own
[40:05] little uh uh sphere and our place of
[40:08] interest and then you know we have a
[40:09] meeting place here. We come here and we
[40:12] have a certain formality. We sing some
[40:14] songs and have a special and and hear a
[40:16] sermon and whatever more and and then we
[40:18] shake hands and go home. uh uh it has to
[40:21] be more than that. And so the unity I
[40:24] was speaking about this morning is not
[40:26] merely unity of gathering in one
[40:29] building, smiling, shaking hands,
[40:32] rejoicing, clapping our hands and doing
[40:36] similar things. That is not the unity.
[40:38] The unity is is is is from this
[40:40] scripture and other scriptures which I
[40:43] will read. It is uh is it not the
[40:46] communion
[40:48] uh of the body of Christ? This is this
[40:50] is one body.
[40:53] We are members of one body. And this
[40:57] body is not something that is
[41:00] malfunctioning. It's a body that works
[41:02] together. It's a body that functions.
[41:06] It's a body that has the same life
[41:08] stream. The same lif stream that's in
[41:09] you is in me is in the next brother, the
[41:11] next sister. the same lif stream, the
[41:15] same interest. The body of Jesus was not
[41:17] divided in his thoughts. No this way,
[41:19] this way and you know all uh in in some
[41:22] confused state. The body of Christ, the
[41:25] body of Christ has one mind, one
[41:28] thought, one vision. And now it doesn't
[41:31] take away from our individuality. We are
[41:34] individuals and we, you know, we're not
[41:37] all put out through uh uh a same machine
[41:40] and and uh we we look different and we
[41:43] do things differently and we we accept
[41:46] that and we acknowledge that. But as far
[41:48] as our spiritual goals and our spiritual
[41:50] vision is concerned, there should be one
[41:53] unified
[41:55] objective I believe along that line. And
[41:58] then the scripture says also now you are
[42:01] the body of Christ
[42:04] and members in particular. It means in
[42:07] particular you have your own part but
[42:12] that part is not some individual part
[42:15] over here. That part is a unified with
[42:18] the rest of the body. That's why it says
[42:21] you are the body of Christ. And doesn't
[42:24] say you're members in particular alone.
[42:27] That would mean you could be you know
[42:29] going any direction. It says but we are
[42:31] the body of Christ and members in
[42:35] particular. We have a part of a unique
[42:38] part of that body of Christ.
[42:42] Then the scripture says also that
[42:45] Ephesians 4 and2 for the per that the
[42:48] ministry was given for the perfecting of
[42:50] the saints for the work of the ministry
[42:53] and for the edifying of the body of
[42:56] Christ as pastors, teachers,
[42:59] evangelists, apostles, prophets, the
[43:02] five-fold ministry has been given for
[43:05] this. And then that is the structure
[43:08] that God has given. And then uh the word
[43:11] of the Lord comes to the prophet and
[43:13] then the ministry as servants of Christ
[43:16] pick that up and God speaks to them out
[43:20] of the out of the message that God has
[43:24] sent. And it doesn't mean that God
[43:25] doesn't speak to the individuals uh
[43:28] individual members. He does and it must
[43:31] be that way. But as far as leadership is
[43:34] concerned, God has a pattern for
[43:36] leadership. He can't have 500 leaders.
[43:40] He has we he has a structure. In fact,
[43:44] is there's a there's a place in your
[43:46] home
[43:47] as as husbands and wives that have you
[43:51] have a home, you have a family. Uh I'm
[43:54] not permitted to cross a boundary of the
[43:57] headship of a father in a home. I'm
[43:59] permitted to work with him but not
[44:02] permitted to uh to uh override that
[44:06] headship in the home. And when I was in
[44:09] uh uh in uh in Brazil just now, that was
[44:13] one of the major points that I started
[44:16] out with the ministers because it it was
[44:19] it's almost like it was a new thing to
[44:21] them. Uh and it was a surprise to them.
[44:24] And I said to the brothers, they're
[44:26] senior brothers and I'm older than they
[44:29] are. So right away they be feel, you
[44:32] know, subservient to myself or some of
[44:35] them do at least. And I said to the
[44:37] brethren, I am here under your
[44:40] leadership. And they just like, you got
[44:44] to be kidding. I said, that's the
[44:46] scripture. I said, "And the prophet, if
[44:48] he ever laid anything out, he laid out
[44:51] that the church is sovereign
[44:55] and the pastor is the head of that
[44:57] church." That's what he said. Now, we
[45:00] can wiggle around if we wanted to. And
[45:02] many people uh who have traveled from
[45:06] other countries down there, you know,
[45:08] they begin to kind of tell those
[45:09] brothers how they should do it and do
[45:11] this way and you're not doing that right
[45:12] and you should have this and you should
[45:14] have that and and try to restructure
[45:16] them and and make them more successful
[45:18] or make them like a church back in
[45:20] America or Canada or whatever more. I
[45:22] said, "Listen, Brother Brandham said
[45:25] furthermore that that the native person
[45:27] that is native to his own country, he
[45:30] knows best how to get the gospel to his
[45:32] own people than than someone else from a
[45:35] foreign land." And I I really drove that
[45:38] thing down. I said, "I am here to serve
[45:42] you in whatever capacity you want us to
[45:46] try to serve you, but we are here
[45:49] subject to your ministry." And every one
[45:52] of these pastors, every one of you are
[45:54] sovereign in your own church. You're
[45:57] sovereign in your own place. And that's
[45:59] the way God has ordained it. And
[46:01] furthermore, once they started to grasp
[46:03] that and once they began to believe that
[46:06] God began to bless the meeting, they
[46:08] they had they had a liberty. They had a
[46:12] they understood then they were being
[46:13] respected uh for their call. And you
[46:17] know a person has to respect uh what you
[46:20] are in Christ be husband wife whatever
[46:23] we are. And so now this body of Christ
[46:27] there's potentials that I'm speaking
[46:28] about the body of Christ the body of
[46:31] Christ has communion. Whether you have
[46:34] it isn't the point. The body of Christ
[46:38] has communion. We may not have developed
[46:40] that communion. We may not have entered
[46:43] into that closeness. we may not have
[46:45] entered into that the beauty of that
[46:48] harmony uh one with another. Uh there
[46:51] may be uh uh in a larger congregation
[46:54] like this and and I've seen many that
[46:57] are much much larger. I find it would be
[46:59] quite impossible. But I think that we
[47:01] should make an an attempt to be uh to be
[47:05] near to one another, to be close to one
[47:08] another, to at least exude the uh
[47:11] feeling that that we are people that are
[47:15] concerned. We are people that are
[47:17] compassionate. We are people. We're not
[47:19] just someone that come here and happen
[47:21] to sit across the church from you and
[47:23] and and and shake hands when we go and
[47:25] so on, but there there is a a closeness.
[47:28] There is a bond. And the bond is a bond
[47:31] of love. I'm going to come to that in a
[47:33] little bit later. But whether we
[47:35] experience it or not is not the point.
[47:38] The point is this body of Christ has the
[47:41] resource of communion within it.
[47:45] Communion.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; A real union. Communion. Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; This this body has the resource of each
[47:57] member being regarded and respected as a
[48:02] unique and special feature in this body
[48:06] of Christ. I don't care whether it's the
[48:07] ear, the eye, the nose or whatever it
[48:10] is. We are members in particular.
[48:14] and whether we have looked upon that
[48:16] brother that sister or or whatever
[48:19] function is happening and you might you
[48:22] know it's not what happens here on the
[48:24] platform uh necessarily I I can tell you
[48:27] I am I am just amazed
[48:30] and I am so appreciative of every member
[48:34] and the part they play and who they are.
[48:38] You might say well I don't do anything.
[48:40] I'm not visible whatsoever. I can tell
[48:42] you that what whatever God has given you
[48:46] to contribute to the body and it it may
[48:50] be something that you think is so
[48:51] insignificant.
[48:53] But let me just tell you something that
[48:55] you might do. You might not do anything
[48:57] more than shake hands with some people,
[49:00] put your offering in the offering, your
[49:02] tithe, uh say an encouraging word, uh
[49:05] maybe make a phone call, tell somebody
[49:08] that you really appreciated them, that
[49:10] thing that you just said to me uh when I
[49:12] was going out of the church that really
[49:14] lifted me up. Uh it may be something so
[49:18] simple and so insignificant, but that
[49:21] may anchor may well anchor something in
[49:24] that other person's heart and that will
[49:27] never leave them till the time they die
[49:30] or the time they're raptured and it
[49:32] remains as an anchor, a simple little
[49:34] word, a simple little statement.
[49:38] I was working once and as a young man
[49:41] just got married, didn't have any
[49:43] children yet and working hard and trying
[49:47] to make a living and I I think I missed
[49:49] a Sunday service and uh a brother just
[49:52] said to me, in fact, it was old brother
[49:54] McGriff. He just said to me, he said,
[49:56] "Whatever you do, build your life around
[49:59] Jesus Christ." And that that that
[50:02] doesn't sound like a profound service,
[50:04] profound profound message, but I never
[50:06] forgot it. I never forgot it. I've been
[50:09] busy. I've been occupied. I've missed
[50:11] services. I've I've, you know, that's
[50:14] just been life. Uh there's been things
[50:16] I've times you sometime you're away from
[50:18] your family, whatever more. But I've
[50:20] always kept that in the back of my mind.
[50:22] Build my life around the Lord Jesus
[50:25] Christ. Make him the focus point. to
[50:28] make him the hub of the whole of the
[50:30] whole wheel.
[50:33] And now this body also
[50:36] this body has it is presently and even
[50:40] at this moment is being edified.
[50:44] This ministry has been given to the
[50:47] church for the edifying of the body. Now
[50:51] we may not make full use of it but my
[50:54] word and my counsel this evening is that
[50:57] every person we should be made aware
[51:00] that when we walk through those doors
[51:02] and sit in this seat that you should be
[51:05] aware this body by almighty God who
[51:08] created heavens and earth and has set
[51:10] the universe in its place and all of
[51:13] these galaxies and everything in its
[51:15] orbit. My God, you have actually you
[51:19] have actually uh created in such a
[51:22] marvelous way this body of Christ and
[51:25] you have brought edifying into this
[51:27] body. This body whether I'm aware of it
[51:30] or whether I'm half asleep is actually
[51:32] being edified right at this moment
[51:36] because he has said it will be edified.
[51:40] That resource is within the body of
[51:43] Christ and it will be edified. your
[51:45] body, you perhaps have something to eat
[51:48] this afternoon and your body without you
[51:51] knowing anything about it is is uh
[51:54] getting nourishment and it's being
[51:57] nutrients are flowing to your body. Your
[52:00] circulatory system uh is is uh dis
[52:03] dispersing with that the energy and
[52:06] everything else that God ordained in
[52:08] this natural life.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:14] Now,
[52:15] I read a quote. I don't read them very
[52:17] often. I only find it in a couple of
[52:20] places where brother Brandham said that
[52:22] the body of Jesus Christ once was quite
[52:25] early, but he also said it in ' 64. And
[52:27] I read it this morning where he said the
[52:30] sickest body was the body of Jesus
[52:32] Christ. Now I I have heard ministers and
[52:35] I I don't really agree with it that they
[52:37] have made that as a major pillar of
[52:40] their ministry sort of thing that the
[52:42] body of Christ is the sickest body and
[52:44] it is all the rest. I don't really I
[52:47] don't go for that. I don't believe that.
[52:48] I believe the body of Christ is the most
[52:51] beautiful woman. The church of Jesus
[52:54] Christ, the bride of Jesus Christ is the
[52:56] most wonderful group. And wherever I
[52:58] have gone, whether it is Zimbabwe or
[53:00] Malawi or Congo or or or uh in Europe or
[53:04] down in South America or Central America
[53:07] or across the United States or Canada,
[53:09] wherever God has led me to be or over in
[53:11] Asia, wherever it is, they're all the
[53:14] same. You could put them right here or
[53:17] put you right over there and there just
[53:19] wouldn't be that much difference. And
[53:21] you'd just take one another and you'd
[53:22] hug one another and you'd feel the same
[53:25] movement, that same flow of the same
[53:27] spirit. It would be there because it is
[53:30] the same body.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; It has the same life.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; It has it's invigorated the same way.
[53:37] And they would get they would get uh
[53:39] enthused and excited and inspired about
[53:41] the same preaching. I can take the same
[53:43] message I preach right here and go down
[53:45] there to Brazil and they just get
[53:47] electrified
[53:49] over the same thing.
[53:51] Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Its body enjoys the same kind of food.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. We have the same kind of
[53:59] diet.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; You'd fall very quiet if I started with
[54:03] some ava Marie Mary or whatever it is,
[54:08] Mary, mother of God, and some of those
[54:10] statements and brought up some rosary
[54:12] and everything. I think that you'd get
[54:14] very deflated pretty quick. You'd say,
[54:17] "What in the world is going on now?"
[54:22] You just say, "This isn't our diet."
[54:26] &gt;&gt; But this resource is in the body.
[54:29] Nevertheless,
[54:31] it uh you can be perfectly healthy, but
[54:34] you need to
[54:36] uh you need to do some things. Now, help
[54:39] me now. You need to do something. Don't
[54:42] go quiet. In other words, you need to do
[54:44] some things. And as you get older and as
[54:48] the message gets older,
[54:52] you need certain exercises
[54:55] and you need certain, you know, body
[54:57] movements that maybe you didn't have
[54:59] when you were young and the message was
[55:02] young and you didn't have any troubles
[55:04] and you didn't have anything to deal
[55:06] with and oh my, it was just all all uh
[55:09] you know fire and thunder and in you're
[55:12] so invigorated and go out in the street
[55:13] and witness and all the rest of it and
[55:15] Oh, just rejoicing. Threw the clock
[55:17] away. Meetings went on for hours. There
[55:20] was there was no meeting. They just
[55:21] started and went on and on and finally
[55:23] everybody went home. That's the way it
[55:25] was. And oh, we could say, "Oh, look at
[55:27] that denomination, all the rest of it."
[55:29] And brother Brandham, he he even said
[55:31] that, you know, the the what they had in
[55:36] Catholicism after a while, they found
[55:38] the same things coming into into
[55:41] Lutheranism.
[55:42] And after when Wesley came, then they
[55:44] found the same things that were in
[55:46] Lutheranism creeping into Wesleyanism.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; And then came Pentecost. And after
[55:51] Pentecost was young and fresh and, you
[55:53] know, full of fire and then pretty soon
[55:56] as it got older, then they found the
[55:58] same things that were in the Wesleyan
[56:00] movement and it coming into there. And
[56:03] now we out of Pentecost, we've gone
[56:05] moved on into bride age. And when we
[56:07] were young and fresh and didn't have all
[56:09] kinds of, you know, there was none of
[56:10] these difficulties or things to be
[56:13] concerned about. But as time went on,
[56:15] you find the same things, you know,
[56:16] moving in, creeping in, all the rest of
[56:18] it. So what do you need? You need to be
[56:20] edified. You need the body needs what
[56:23] God has put in it. And the resource is
[56:26] here.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; The resource is here. God has placed the
[56:32] resources. the body of Jesus Christ is
[56:35] being edified. But sometime now as you
[56:38] get a little older and I realize my
[56:42] goodness, it's hard to, you know, watch
[56:45] uh uh the breath and the weight and and
[56:50] all the other things that go with it and
[56:53] the movements. Goodness, why is that
[56:56] shoulder hurting? and get up out of bed
[56:59] in the morning, you know, and you just
[57:01] don't straighten up as fast as you used
[57:04] to.
[57:06] I've seen some of you a whole lot
[57:07] younger than me and you're having
[57:08] trouble,
[57:11] but you know what it's like. And so you
[57:13] find you have to start doing things in
[57:15] the body of Christ. Oh, well, we didn't
[57:18] have to do that, you know, back there,
[57:20] but now there are certain exercises that
[57:22] we need to have. And maybe back there,
[57:25] oh, the communion was so sweet. It was
[57:27] so instantaneous. There were just
[57:29] nothing. We just were one little unit,
[57:31] you know, and maybe you remember back in
[57:33] some place that you wear and it's just a
[57:35] little home group and whatever more,
[57:37] which is perfectly fine. But I've been
[57:39] in home groups that had more detention
[57:41] in them than we have here.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Been at each other's neck. My goodness.
[57:52] So, we need to be edified
[57:56] and we need to work at having
[58:00] communion,
[58:02] &gt;&gt; not communion, but as as the Lord's
[58:05] table, but you need to work at it.
[58:08] Amen.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Those of you that are married, you need
[58:13] to work at it.
[58:15] They say marriages are made in heaven
[58:18] but God left a whole lot of work on
[58:20] earth to be done
[58:23] in them.
[58:25] And brother Brandham says in this what
[58:27] shall I do with Jesus?
[58:30] He says right before us and this has
[58:32] been used for healing
[58:34] so much. Right before us we see the
[58:38] image of a perfect healed person by
[58:41] faith.
[58:43] And then we just make step by step till
[58:47] you step right into that person
[58:50] and just walk right on with it. There
[58:54] you are.
[58:56] That's what it take. That's
[58:59] what does it. Your faith, not your
[59:03] feelings. Your faith does it. But
[59:06] thanks. But thanks and praise be to God.
[59:09] Now, you might think this is uh
[59:12] stretching that a wee bit, but I don't
[59:13] think it is at all. You put before you
[59:16] what you think the body of Jesus Christ
[59:20] is.
[59:21] That perfect,
[59:24] harmonious,
[59:27] magnificent
[59:29] body of Jesus Christ. A body of power,
[59:34] a body of single thought, a body of
[59:37] single vision. one that operated like it
[59:40] was here on earth when Jesus Christ
[59:42] moved here. Although he was a man that
[59:46] was didn't have any beauty that we
[59:50] should desire him, yet I believe that
[59:53] his movements must have been with the
[59:56] most glorious grace. And brother
[59:59] Brandham said at the pool of Bethesda,
[1:00:01] he probably stepped over people that
[1:00:04] were sick and afflicted and invalid. And
[1:00:07] there he was. But he already had had the
[1:00:10] vision. He knew exactly where he was
[1:00:12] going. To me, that's the glorious grace.
[1:00:14] The body of Christ isn't some confused
[1:00:18] person today. The body of Christ isn't
[1:00:20] some uh uh I isn't a unit around the
[1:00:24] world that is uh scattered helter and
[1:00:27] skelter and doesn't know what it's
[1:00:29] doing. I find it uh very very marvelous
[1:00:33] under the opaces of the Holy Spirit. And
[1:00:36] when I speak of the the Congo or I speak
[1:00:39] of Brazil or I go to Brazil and speak of
[1:00:41] Cloverdale and speak of what God is
[1:00:43] doing in various places, it is it is to
[1:00:46] me it is absolutely marvelous.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And I say to our God, how marvelous it
[1:00:52] is, how glorious that you redeemed a
[1:00:56] people out of this cesspool of iniquity
[1:00:59] and have brought a pure body bride of
[1:01:02] Jesus Christ. How wonderful. What a
[1:01:05] master plan that you came and descended
[1:01:07] into Satan's Eden and and brought a
[1:01:10] virtuous bride out.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the the the the
[1:01:20] serpent
[1:01:22] went to Eve's
[1:01:24] head
[1:01:27] and took
[1:01:29] her reasoning.
[1:01:31] God came to a virgin and took her womb.
[1:01:38] Jesus Christ came in this time, didn't
[1:01:41] appeal to her head, but came to the womb
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; of the virgin bride and pregnantated her
[1:01:48] with a pure thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:01:51] That's already happened. And she is, I
[1:01:54] tell you, a purchased a purchased body
[1:01:57] of people, a glorious church without
[1:02:01] spot or wrinkle, whether you see it or
[1:02:03] don't see it, but that's what the word
[1:02:05] of God has said.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; And so I think we should as a as a group
[1:02:11] of people, I would like to encourage and
[1:02:14] all those who may be listening and
[1:02:16] streaming. I I went home. I don't even
[1:02:18] know how the people got to the computer
[1:02:20] in time. Got home already. email from
[1:02:23] Finland and another email from United
[1:02:25] States regarding the service this
[1:02:28] morning and the people were just blessed
[1:02:29] by it and and a sister in Finland
[1:02:32] interpret it for her brother. I'm sorry
[1:02:34] for her husband and pro maybe wouldn't
[1:02:37] be listening now but be getting in the
[1:02:39] middle of the night there but if they
[1:02:40] hear the service she'll certainly know
[1:02:42] I'm speaking her husband as she
[1:02:44] interpreted the message he said well
[1:02:46] then unforgiveness would be like a blood
[1:02:49] clot it would be stopping the blood from
[1:02:51] flowing to the part of the body and it
[1:02:54] wouldn't be getting the healing that it
[1:02:56] needs and she said that's exactly right.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm glad for what people were
[1:03:01] getting from it. But what we need to do
[1:03:03] is we view this body of Christ and
[1:03:07] however you relate to it, whether you
[1:03:10] feel deficient or whether you feel
[1:03:12] lacking or I don't know how you feel or
[1:03:15] you feel overjoyed and and uh uh uh uh
[1:03:19] just uh uh important part of it or uh
[1:03:23] really connected. But nevertheless, I
[1:03:26] think we we all need to see this body of
[1:03:29] Christ and walk towards it
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; and walk into it.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I have had I've had some
[1:03:36] little thing, you know, it's caused a
[1:03:38] fragmentation of my closeness with
[1:03:40] somebody else." Then I think you need
[1:03:43] need to stop looking at that person. You
[1:03:45] need to look at this body of Christ.
[1:03:47] Say, "This body of Christ has perfect
[1:03:49] communion. This body of Christ is
[1:03:51] absolutely a unified body. this body of
[1:03:54] Christ walks in and works in one unit.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And I walk into that.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; I believe God would bless that.
[1:04:08] He said in
[1:04:10] uh one in a million,
[1:04:14] he said, "I'd give my entire life for
[1:04:16] this cause.
[1:04:18] And may I say this with sincerity?
[1:04:22] If I had 10,000 lives, I'd never change
[1:04:25] my opinion. Now he said, "Now healing is
[1:04:28] in the reach of every person." Remember,
[1:04:30] healing is in you. Talking about
[1:04:32] healing. I'm talking about healing in
[1:04:34] the body of Jesus Christ. There is
[1:04:36] healing. You think that God would put
[1:04:38] healing in our physical body and not put
[1:04:41] healing in the body of Christ? I tell
[1:04:43] you, there is healing in the body of
[1:04:44] Christ.
[1:04:46] And you might be a cell that will heal
[1:04:48] another cell. You might be one that is
[1:04:50] lifted up and needs to lift another one
[1:04:52] up and minister to another part of the
[1:04:55] body of Christ. Not just, you know, not
[1:04:58] just to have a little circulation here
[1:05:00] and then go on out, but that we actually
[1:05:02] are ministering to one another. And then
[1:05:04] he went on to say, God placed in the
[1:05:06] peach tree every peach that would ever
[1:05:10] be in it. Then he planted it in the
[1:05:12] garden. He said the peach tree or the
[1:05:15] apple tree or the fruit tree just has to
[1:05:18] grow from drinking the water in the
[1:05:20] earth. Now each one of you has those
[1:05:25] potentials in you to deliver you.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Each one of you
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; have in you the potentials the
[1:05:34] potentials perhaps has not become actual
[1:05:37] yet but you have the potential to
[1:05:41] deliver you.
[1:05:42] Hallelujah.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; I say praise be to quad.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; We may need to develop it. We may need
[1:05:50] to develop it further. Might be
[1:05:53] something that has been idled for a
[1:05:54] while. Needs to be uh started up again.
[1:06:00] So, well, I used to do that. I actually
[1:06:02] used to read my Bible. I actually used
[1:06:04] to take time to hear a message. I
[1:06:06] actually used to, you know, participate
[1:06:08] in some. But I've been too busy. Well,
[1:06:11] we're going to get to that, too. So,
[1:06:12] we've talked about the potentials of
[1:06:15] unity this morning, and so I won't go
[1:06:17] any further on that, but what ties in
[1:06:20] with the potentials of unity is the
[1:06:23] potential for, and I I think I'm aiming
[1:06:26] high
[1:06:28] for divine love. We can say it, we can
[1:06:32] speak about it, but I'm talking about an
[1:06:35] active divine capstone love.
[1:06:40] Love can look at a lot of bad things and
[1:06:44] look beyond it.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, if you've ever, you know,
[1:06:49] been standing where I stand, you've had
[1:06:53] family or have children or have those
[1:06:56] that are near to you or relatives and we
[1:06:58] all do.
[1:07:00] Often you have to look beyond a lot of
[1:07:02] things and see
[1:07:06] see what love sees.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; that black woman that had a boy that was
[1:07:13] dying from a social disease, from an
[1:07:15] immoral life, she looked way beyond his
[1:07:19] sin. She looked beyond his disease. She
[1:07:23] looked beyond death that was claiming
[1:07:25] him and patted his ared his face and
[1:07:29] said, "Mama's little boy."
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; And that kind of love she, I tell you,
[1:07:35] she mined. She developed the resource of
[1:07:39] love that pulled an airplane with Elijah
[1:07:43] on it out of the sky.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; That kind of love. And brother Brandon
[1:07:48] looked at me, Brother John, he said,
[1:07:50] "Brother Eddie," he said, "what brought
[1:07:52] that airplane down? What caused that
[1:07:55] snowstorm?"
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; And I didn't say anything. I didn't know
[1:07:58] what to say. He said, "That woman's love
[1:08:00] for her son."
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. just a black mother, a black
[1:08:08] woman living in a poor part of the city.
[1:08:11] But her love was strong enough to change
[1:08:15] the elements of the sky and bring a
[1:08:18] snowstorm and bring a pilot and a plane
[1:08:21] down
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; and bring a minister by her way, a
[1:08:25] prophet
[1:08:27] right by her gate. I tell you, there's
[1:08:31] one happy woman.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And that God will honor faith wherever
[1:08:36] he finds it. Because I want to tell you
[1:08:39] something this evening. This that I'm
[1:08:41] speaking about divine love is a law of
[1:08:44] love.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; I say to you tonight, it's the law.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; It is the law.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; And that resource is within the
[1:08:52] believer.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; It is so strong in surging through me
[1:08:57] right now. Whether you see it in life or
[1:08:59] don't see it in life, God is not a man
[1:09:01] that he can he can lie. He made a
[1:09:04] promise. And if you claim that promise,
[1:09:06] he's not going to look you in the face
[1:09:08] and say, "I couldn't keep it."
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; He's going to keep that.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, it's impossible." Nothing is
[1:09:17] impossible with God.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Say, "That's aiming high. What's wrong
[1:09:26] with it? What's wrong with it? Can we
[1:09:29] aim too high?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; I say aim high.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Whether we even see it in life
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; or we don't see it,
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; that's irrelevant. We believe it.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; We believe it.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; God who could take Abraham when his body
[1:09:47] was dead and Sarah's womb that was
[1:09:50] already dead and the milk veins. Is this
[1:09:53] your God?
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Is this your God?
[1:09:57] God that can change their very mortal
[1:10:00] lif stream and bring her back to
[1:10:03] conception. And you think somebody is
[1:10:06] beyond salvation or redemption? Not by
[1:10:09] my God standards.
[1:10:11] God is waiting for us to tap in to the
[1:10:14] resource that's within us now.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; And it won't function. It won't operate
[1:10:23] simply by well I go to Cloverdale Bible.
[1:10:25] That doesn't mean anything. Uh we got
[1:10:28] good preacher. That doesn't mean a
[1:10:30] thing. We got good singers. We got good
[1:10:32] musicians. We got wonderful deacons and
[1:10:34] all the rest of it. That doesn't mean
[1:10:36] anything. You You can have all of that.
[1:10:38] But it's the word. It's the word. Faith
[1:10:41] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:10:43] word of God. And if you believe that
[1:10:46] word, then nothing is impossible with
[1:10:48] this God.
[1:10:50] That's a divine love.
[1:11:00] Brother Brandham said in the questions
[1:11:02] and answers
[1:11:04] in 54, he said, "I'll give you my
[1:11:07] estimation
[1:11:09] of what I think that the closest thing
[1:11:11] to an evidence that a man is a Christian
[1:11:15] than anything I know of."
[1:11:17] Now, if you're interested in his
[1:11:18] estimation,
[1:11:20] let your ears be perked up.
[1:11:25] You know what it is? It's travail of
[1:11:29] soul.
[1:11:31] A person that is so hungering and
[1:11:34] thirsting for God day and night that
[1:11:38] they just can't stand it.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And they got to do something for God.
[1:11:44] And they're full of love. And they're
[1:11:46] just a soul travail. Just travailing all
[1:11:50] the time. The Bible said, "He that goeth
[1:11:52] forth seowing in tears will doubtless
[1:11:55] return again, rejoicing, bringing with
[1:11:58] him precious sheav."
[1:12:02] This resource of perfect love
[1:12:06] in uh in the message explaining healing
[1:12:09] and and the raising of Gyrus's daughter,
[1:12:12] I guess it is
[1:12:14] in Gyrus.
[1:12:16] Anyways uh
[1:12:20] talks about the law it's simple the law
[1:12:23] of electricity
[1:12:25] he said if you work according to the law
[1:12:27] of electricity
[1:12:30] said if you then he said if you have an
[1:12:32] artisian well you can have an artisian
[1:12:35] well on one side of a hill putting out
[1:12:37] thousands of gallons of water per minute
[1:12:40] and on the other side of the hill you've
[1:12:44] got a crop burning up and it's needing
[1:12:47] that water. He said, "Well, now he said,
[1:12:50] if God is here in this building right
[1:12:53] now," and he asked the people if they
[1:12:55] believe it. Said, "You could shout, you
[1:12:57] could pray, you could do all of the
[1:12:59] things that you wanted to, and that
[1:13:01] water still wouldn't get from that
[1:13:03] artisian well to the other burning crop.
[1:13:07] But if you just used the law of gravity,
[1:13:11] you could get that water to that burning
[1:13:13] to to that burning crop on the other
[1:13:15] side of the hill. And then he he came
[1:13:18] right down. He said, "Now, if God is in
[1:13:20] this building now, here you might think
[1:13:23] if brother Brandon was here, it' all be
[1:13:24] different. It wouldn't be a bit
[1:13:25] different.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't be one bit different. You might
[1:13:28] get more excited. You might have more
[1:13:30] expectation. And I suppose that you
[1:13:32] would, but it wouldn't. You still would
[1:13:35] have to operate faith. You could come
[1:13:37] right before him right here. He could
[1:13:39] reveal the secret of your heart, but
[1:13:41] you'd still have to believe it. He's
[1:13:43] talked to a woman and he said and he
[1:13:45] reveals the tells her the very secret of
[1:13:48] her heart. He says she's missing it.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; And many that got it got their physical
[1:13:57] uh prayer answered never got a spiritual
[1:14:01] revelation. But he said now the only
[1:14:04] thing that you can do is work according
[1:14:07] to the law of God for our healing. He
[1:14:11] said is that right? And what is the law
[1:14:14] of God? What is the law of God?
[1:14:17] Coverdale Bible way
[1:14:20] said his love
[1:14:22] perfect love that casts out all fear.
[1:14:26] Love and faith is the same thing. love,
[1:14:30] perfect love, cast out all fear. I
[1:14:33] believe that that goes hand in hand
[1:14:42] with unity.
[1:14:44] The reason I hesitate there because I
[1:14:46] was thinking they're wondering if I
[1:14:47] should say something or not. But you
[1:14:49] know, I I may be uh a little bit
[1:14:52] strange,
[1:14:55] but I have a little problem with this
[1:14:58] phrase because it's so loose. I love
[1:15:00] you.
[1:15:02] I have a problem with that because I
[1:15:05] feel before I say that, I really need to
[1:15:08] weigh out what it is that I'm saying and
[1:15:12] the depths of those words because they
[1:15:15] happen to have they happen to carry a
[1:15:17] huge responsibility.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; If I love you, that means that
[1:15:24] regardless of what you may do, I'm going
[1:15:28] to hang on to you. I'm going to hold you
[1:15:31] fast. I'm going to believe in you. I'm
[1:15:34] going to be one with you for your
[1:15:36] benefit, for your best. And even though
[1:15:39] you may go off uh into some distant
[1:15:42] place or whatever more, love is strong
[1:15:45] enough to change the circumstances
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; and bring people around.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; And it's not your love. It's his love
[1:15:55] just flowing through you. You're only
[1:15:58] the vessel. It's not your love, it's his
[1:16:00] love.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Paul said to Timothy, "Let no man
[1:16:08] despise
[1:16:09] thy youth, but be thou an an example."
[1:16:13] And I would like, I don't think we're
[1:16:15] aiming too high. If I say to this
[1:16:18] church, I would like this church to be
[1:16:21] an example. You may say, "Well, it
[1:16:23] already is. I'm happy if it is, but I
[1:16:26] would like to be a better and a brighter
[1:16:30] example with a higher standard with a
[1:16:33] and when I talk about higher standard,
[1:16:35] I'm not talking about dress code
[1:16:37] necessarily. I'm talking about a
[1:16:39] spiritual standard where we see the
[1:16:41] manifestation of God amongst the people
[1:16:45] and where people become in visit and
[1:16:47] say, "What love they have the brethren
[1:16:50] one for another. What a body of people."
[1:16:53] and that it might might ripple out and
[1:16:56] others may hear it. What a diverse
[1:16:58] congregation. People from many nations,
[1:17:01] but they love one another. They respect
[1:17:04] one another. Can you say amen?
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Is this too high to aim? I think not. I
[1:17:10] think that resource lays right here
[1:17:14] tonight in these seats.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; That resource to be a greater example. I
[1:17:20] believe that we would benefit the body
[1:17:22] of Christ. They could hear perhaps from
[1:17:26] other places, other cities, other
[1:17:28] churches, other places. Maybe they have
[1:17:32] other kind of difficulty and they could
[1:17:34] look and say, "Well, there's a beacon
[1:17:36] light that's shining."
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; What a tragedy it would be. What a
[1:17:44] tragedy it'd be if we say, "Well,
[1:17:49] you know, we've we've had
[1:17:52] uh just
[1:17:55] spiritual dilemma and all kinds of
[1:17:58] difficulty."
[1:18:00] And uh we're not immune to that. I'm
[1:18:05] talking real plain. We could have that's
[1:18:08] easy to have
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; say, well, we got warfare or war taking
[1:18:13] place amongst the members and the
[1:18:15] deacons fight and they can't agree with
[1:18:17] the trustees and the pastors this and
[1:18:20] other ministers of that and war and
[1:18:23] dispute taking place and open open
[1:18:26] argument happening and so on. Wouldn't
[1:18:29] wouldn't that be a discouragement to
[1:18:31] you?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be tragic? Wouldn't that
[1:18:34] be terrible? That's the other side of
[1:18:36] the coin. And yet on the other hand, we
[1:18:39] don't want to become
[1:18:43] just so
[1:18:45] uh we become professional at hiding our
[1:18:47] feelings.
[1:18:50] You know, they used to have a little
[1:18:53] cartoon and somebody would be doing
[1:18:56] something and shaking hands or giving a
[1:18:59] compliment to somebody. But out here was
[1:19:02] another little cloud that said what they
[1:19:04] were really thinking.
[1:19:07] Well, you look so lovely today. And they
[1:19:09] say, where'd they get that garment? Down
[1:19:11] in the garbage dump. You know, something
[1:19:14] like that.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Say, oh, you know, so nice to have you.
[1:19:20] And the other guy is saying, how can I
[1:19:22] get out of here and
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; get on my way?
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you. You all have that
[1:19:31] cloud. I've had that cloud a whole lot
[1:19:33] of times. And people actually pick it
[1:19:35] up. They can say, "I know you're busy. I
[1:19:37] know you got that is right. That's
[1:19:39] exactly right.
[1:19:47] Choosing the harder way.
[1:19:53] It's not easy. In fact, is I personally
[1:19:57] find it difficult. I'm sure Every human
[1:20:00] does finds it somewhat difficult to lay
[1:20:04] down our own hurts, our own feelings
[1:20:10] our own, you know, something that is uh
[1:20:16] it has touched you very very deep. It's
[1:20:19] hard to lay that down,
[1:20:21] you know, and this is not a counseling
[1:20:24] session and yet I think it is very very
[1:20:26] very
[1:20:27] needful instruction.
[1:20:29] In fact is I don't think there's
[1:20:31] instruction I could be preaching it. We
[1:20:34] need to and we need to practice that. We
[1:20:36] need to put it into practice now.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; We really do need to just lay those
[1:20:41] hurts down. Lay those things down and
[1:20:44] move on
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; from that. Move on from that because
[1:20:49] those things have an they they they
[1:20:52] afflict us.
[1:20:54] They have an effect upon us as a body of
[1:20:58] people. It may not I'm not just speaking
[1:21:00] about people within the church. I'm
[1:21:02] talking about, you know, can be things
[1:21:03] outside.
[1:21:05] You you you that work in the workplace,
[1:21:08] you can get so afflicted from a
[1:21:11] workplace and you pack that home. you
[1:21:14] kids from school that are in in various
[1:21:17] schools, you can pick up such a spirit
[1:21:19] at school and then you pack it right
[1:21:21] home and upset the whole household.
[1:21:27] These spirits,
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; they jump around.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; They sure do. And and the enemy is there
[1:21:35] just upset the whole house, bring
[1:21:37] distress, bring dissension, maybe get
[1:21:39] the mother going one side, the dad going
[1:21:42] the other side. Where'd it come from?
[1:21:43] maybe from some classroom. We got to be
[1:21:46] spiritual.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; And you know, if if it depends what
[1:21:50] frame of mind a person is in. I I've
[1:21:53] said here before people say, "Well, you
[1:21:55] know, I don't like this thing up here."
[1:21:58] Well, that's fine. Maybe I don't like it
[1:22:00] either. But what does that what's the
[1:22:02] difference? What has that got to do with
[1:22:04] what is happening
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; in the communion of the body of Christ?
[1:22:09] It really has nothing. It's perishing.
[1:22:12] It's passing away. It has nothing to do
[1:22:14] with it. The color of the carpet or the
[1:22:16] color of the walls or whether it's what
[1:22:18] is this or what is, you know, whether
[1:22:20] it's cold or whether it's too hot.
[1:22:21] That's fine. We try to make it as
[1:22:23] comfortable and as good as possible. But
[1:22:24] on the other hand, our our message and
[1:22:28] our prophet talks about rugged people.
[1:22:30] You want to be happy you're not sitting
[1:22:31] on the concrete.
[1:22:34] want to be happy we're not suffering
[1:22:36] with some snow outside or some cold
[1:22:38] weather or some hot weather or humid
[1:22:42] weather or whatever more. We we we come
[1:22:44] here for communion. We come here to
[1:22:46] edify one another and we are what we are
[1:22:49] and we can't be anything else. Let's
[1:22:51] raise the standard higher and say we'll
[1:22:54] be a body of people that move in the
[1:22:57] spirit of God and we'll not allow Satan
[1:23:00] to have an opportunity. won't allow him
[1:23:03] to get a foothold in here because we
[1:23:05] believe in the law. The law of perfect
[1:23:08] love. We believe in that law.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Law will drive you to risk your life.
[1:23:20] Love, the law of love will cause you to
[1:23:23] risk your life.
[1:23:25] Love will drive us to expend ourselves.
[1:23:30] people people say and I I'm not saying I
[1:23:33] can only speak personally on on some
[1:23:34] things but they'll say why you know why
[1:23:37] you go down there all that way for for
[1:23:40] one week and just back and you know wear
[1:23:43] yourself out and you know we need you at
[1:23:45] home and so on so forth. I realize all
[1:23:47] that but I can't tell you the things
[1:23:50] that I know that are needed. I I can't I
[1:23:54] can't speak that publicly. So many
[1:23:56] things you can't say and you just need
[1:23:59] to be there for them and need to give
[1:24:04] whatever you can give and you can't give
[1:24:07] something that you aren't and something
[1:24:08] that you don't have but you're there to
[1:24:10] give what you can give and and most
[1:24:13] times it isn't it is in money it's not
[1:24:15] finances it's not that they just they
[1:24:19] some say I want to shake the hand
[1:24:23] that took brother Brandham's
[1:24:26] I had a lot of them say that right here.
[1:24:29] I want to shake your hand.
[1:24:32] Brother came right up. I'm just sitting
[1:24:34] with almost wasted after an hour and a
[1:24:36] half or so. And he says, "Can I have
[1:24:39] your handkerchief?"
[1:24:41] I said, "It's all wet. It's all sweaty."
[1:24:44] I said, "I just want to have it." I
[1:24:48] don't know what it means to him.
[1:24:50] I've had him take it. Say, "Can I have
[1:24:52] your tie?
[1:24:54] Well, it's all wet. I'd like to have
[1:24:56] your tie. Can you give me your tie? I
[1:24:59] take my tie off and give it my tie.
[1:25:02] I have your handkerchief.
[1:25:04] I want to have it. Somebody took my
[1:25:05] handkerchief said I'm not ever going to
[1:25:07] wash this.
[1:25:10] You know, I don't think there isn't one
[1:25:13] one there isn't one ounce of virtue to
[1:25:16] that.
[1:25:18] But yet I want I I don't want to
[1:25:20] hesitate to say very quickly and we need
[1:25:23] this as a as a as a body of Christ. I
[1:25:26] know that that kind of respect
[1:25:28] for the ministry and the man of God is
[1:25:32] going to put them in good standing with
[1:25:34] God. And if we had that kind of respect
[1:25:37] one for another, I'm not asking for
[1:25:40] that, but for one for another, that when
[1:25:42] you look at another, you realize Jesus
[1:25:45] Christ in all of his suffering hung
[1:25:48] there for this person, for this young
[1:25:50] man, for this brother, for this sister.
[1:25:52] Jesus Christ loved them so much. God
[1:25:55] loved them so much. He sent Christ down
[1:25:57] from the glory of heaven to suffer and
[1:26:01] die for them.
[1:26:04] and I respect them.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; And they're doing their best.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; They're sincere.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; They're a member of the body of Christ.
[1:26:13] And that will set up a communion
[1:26:16] between you and them. And you'll begin
[1:26:18] to discover a new appreciation
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; one for another.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Love will cause you to expend yourself.
[1:26:27] Love will
[1:26:30] overcome offense.
[1:26:33] so that you will not be offended. I'm
[1:26:36] just going quickly because I want to
[1:26:38] come to this now before I close. I've
[1:26:40] been almost an hour now and I want to
[1:26:42] close in a little bit, but this is
[1:26:44] coming to one of the most important
[1:26:46] parts.
[1:26:47] I want you to think with me about the
[1:26:49] resource of time.
[1:26:52] Time.
[1:26:57] Satan has engineered things
[1:27:00] to rob us of our time.
[1:27:02] I believe it's highway robbery.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; He's put a gun to our head and said,
[1:27:10] "You're going to do this and you're
[1:27:11] going to keep this schedule
[1:27:13] and you've got this much to do
[1:27:16] and this is going to keep demand your
[1:27:19] time."
[1:27:21] The scripture says
[1:27:25] Job 14 and5 seeing that his days are
[1:27:28] determined and the number of his months
[1:27:31] are with thee, thou hast appointed his
[1:27:34] bounds that he cannot pass.
[1:27:39] Our days are determined
[1:27:42] and our months are with him.
[1:27:45] and he has appointed our bounds and we
[1:27:48] cannot pass that. And David said in
[1:27:52] Psalms, the days of our years are three
[1:27:54] score years and 10. And if by reason of
[1:27:57] strength they be four score years, yet
[1:28:00] is their strength labor and sorrow, for
[1:28:03] it is soon cut off and we fly away.
[1:28:10] Each one here has been given a deposit
[1:28:14] by God,
[1:28:16] a resource
[1:28:18] of so much time
[1:28:22] and those bounds are already set. You
[1:28:25] have so many days, weeks, months, and
[1:28:29] years.
[1:28:31] And God
[1:28:33] has given it to you and allowing you to
[1:28:37] determine pretty much how that is spent.
[1:28:43] And Satan has engineered things so that
[1:28:50] he would make it such so it would be uh
[1:28:54] just a
[1:28:56] an incredible struggle to have barely
[1:29:01] enough time to say a short prayer,
[1:29:05] to come to church
[1:29:08] or to have a little time for God. And I
[1:29:11] think that he has perpetrated
[1:29:15] a massive fraud upon the body of Christ.
[1:29:21] There's an article here says, "Ready,
[1:29:24] set? Let's slow down.
[1:29:31] This is just how the world is viewing
[1:29:33] things." But can you listen close?
[1:29:39] this person who wrote this had a near
[1:29:41] miss on the highway and almost had an
[1:29:44] accident.
[1:29:47] And so they said that this close call,
[1:29:49] you know, it caused them to think
[1:29:52] and they write heart disease because of
[1:29:55] the pressure of this age. Heart disease
[1:29:58] is our number one health problem
[1:30:01] followed by depression.
[1:30:05] Happiness has been on the decline for
[1:30:08] the past 40 years. Isn't that amazing?
[1:30:14] God calls a voice off the earth and
[1:30:16] happiness begins to deteriorate.
[1:30:22] I don't think there's a medical category
[1:30:25] for hurry sickness,
[1:30:29] but we're all carriers.
[1:30:31] We're all carriers of hurry sickness.
[1:30:37] Says, "Our incredible energy," and I'm
[1:30:39] just taking little excerpts, "Our
[1:30:41] incredible energy," speaking of the
[1:30:43] American people, this is out of the
[1:30:44] Seattle Times, I believe it is, "Our
[1:30:47] incredible energy has become obsessive,
[1:30:52] rushing, and maybe we're just galloping
[1:30:54] toward a cliff."
[1:30:58] said, "Could we learn something from
[1:31:00] Europe? Slow life.
[1:31:04] There's a movement over there, slow
[1:31:07] life." And there was a quite a joke over
[1:31:10] the fact that McDonald's, which is fast
[1:31:13] food, set up a place in Italy where they
[1:31:18] traditionally like to take a lot of time
[1:31:20] eating. And so they've called it slow
[1:31:23] food
[1:31:25] instead of fast food.
[1:31:28] And now there's around 6,000
[1:31:33] places that have opened up and they call
[1:31:35] it slow food
[1:31:37] to encourage the people to take a little
[1:31:40] more time. Now just listen just a
[1:31:43] moment.
[1:31:45] They are saying this journalist has said
[1:31:48] but the most significant reason to slow
[1:31:51] down is time for relationships.
[1:31:57] Why? Because research shows that taking
[1:32:01] time for friends and family is the most
[1:32:05] important thing you can do for your
[1:32:09] physical and psychological well-being.
[1:32:13] This is just a world talking about human
[1:32:17] relationship.
[1:32:18] I'm talking about taking time for a
[1:32:22] spiritual relationship.
[1:32:26] You know when Jesus saidf follow me
[1:32:31] I will make you fishes of men and the
[1:32:33] Bible says also that there were others
[1:32:36] women that ministered to him and so on.
[1:32:38] So, it wasn't just the 12 disciples.
[1:32:40] There were many others that followed
[1:32:42] him. And I was just thinking as I
[1:32:46] pondered this subject, it takes time
[1:32:49] to follow the master. And follow also
[1:32:53] comes into being a disciple. And a
[1:32:57] disciple is essentially a follower. And
[1:33:00] in the in the Bible days, a master or a
[1:33:03] leader or uh uh one that was considered
[1:33:06] as a spiritual leader, he perhaps ride
[1:33:09] before
[1:33:11] his students and his students would
[1:33:12] follow him. They study and watch eagerly
[1:33:17] how he does things. And he is not just
[1:33:21] their master, but he is their example.
[1:33:24] And they intend to follow him.
[1:33:27] I I I I want to say
[1:33:31] that this congregation here.
[1:33:35] We do have some time.
[1:33:40] And I would like to lift the standard of
[1:33:43] how we use that time.
[1:33:47] We perhaps don't have to be as long as
[1:33:49] we need to be on the telephone.
[1:33:52] I saw an ad
[1:33:54] and there were a group of ladies and I
[1:33:56] think it I think it's just worth saying
[1:33:58] there a group of ladies and they were
[1:34:00] having a little lunchon together
[1:34:03] on a nice balcony just overlooking a
[1:34:07] beautiful little lake and you could see
[1:34:09] it was so serene and so lovely and so
[1:34:13] nice and they were enjoying one
[1:34:14] another's company
[1:34:17] and
[1:34:19] the cell phone went off
[1:34:22] one of the lady's cell phone. She
[1:34:23] reaches into her purse, takes out the
[1:34:26] cell phone,
[1:34:28] looks at it, and she just pits that
[1:34:31] thing like a hand grenade into the lake.
[1:34:34] And all the other women reached into
[1:34:35] their purse. They all grabbed their cell
[1:34:37] phone. They all pit their cell phones
[1:34:39] into the lake.
[1:34:42] I thought that was a good thing to do.
[1:34:44] We become slaves to those things. And
[1:34:47] some don't have one, they have two. And
[1:34:49] I've been with brothers that have three
[1:34:56] and can talk on two at once.
[1:35:02] I don't know what it is. I really don't.
[1:35:04] I'm a busy person. I have people I can
[1:35:06] be connected with all over the place.
[1:35:08] But you know, and I I shut that cell
[1:35:09] phone down and and and I get in the
[1:35:12] airplane and and the thing just barely
[1:35:15] touched the ground and you know, there's
[1:35:18] somebody on the phone, maybe some young
[1:35:20] girl or some fellow or some businessman,
[1:35:22] and I don't know, maybe it's a sense of
[1:35:24] power. I don't know what it is. You
[1:35:25] know, they get on the phone and I'm busy
[1:35:28] and I'm connected. You know, sometimes I
[1:35:31] wonder whether they're trying to tell me
[1:35:32] I actually got somebody to talk to. And
[1:35:35] sometimes I wonder if they're actually
[1:35:37] talking to anybody. Yeah, sell those
[1:35:39] shares. Oh, are we only going to make
[1:35:41] 400,000? Well, that's too bad. Anyway,
[1:35:43] sell them anyway. And
[1:35:48] the way it is. I got off the last plane.
[1:35:50] They're just all kinds of people on the
[1:35:52] cell phone. I I got a cell phone. I just
[1:35:54] shut the thing down. I didn't even open
[1:35:56] the thing up. I could have been talking
[1:35:57] to people and reading, but I just think
[1:35:59] there's, you know, when I go to dial
[1:36:01] somebody, even in the church, I think,
[1:36:04] how many calls have they got? Do they
[1:36:06] really need me? Do I really need to make
[1:36:09] this call to them right now? Sometime I
[1:36:11] think about that because I just think
[1:36:13] about, you know, their time. I'm getting
[1:36:15] more conscious of time. We've got a
[1:36:17] resource of time. I would like to raise
[1:36:20] the standard of what we do with our time
[1:36:22] in this church. you in your home,
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; you young people, I don't care whether
[1:36:28] and I think you need to become very very
[1:36:30] regimented. Say, I am going to take more
[1:36:34] time for my relationship with Jesus
[1:36:38] Christ. I'm going to tell him. And I
[1:36:41] think we as a church need to take more
[1:36:44] time with our families and more time
[1:36:47] with one another and more time
[1:36:50] with brothers and sisters.
[1:36:53] Do you agree?
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Can I can I just carry on with this?
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; You know, one of the things that they
[1:37:00] said is exactly what brother Brandham.
[1:37:01] Brother Brandham said that the streets
[1:37:03] would be full of neurotics
[1:37:06] and they are saying right here that the
[1:37:09] pressure of time on the people is
[1:37:12] turning them into that.
[1:37:15] He said
[1:37:17] uh
[1:37:21] they said well if they start going this
[1:37:22] way they they indicated uh uh
[1:37:27] won't that ruin the economy if everybody
[1:37:29] slows down? Won't that ruin the economy?
[1:37:34] He said what's the economy for?
[1:37:37] Isn't it to help create a happy healthy
[1:37:39] country? What good is a healthy economy
[1:37:42] if it's killing its citizens?
[1:37:44] Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; It goes on to say and there's a
[1:37:48] gentleman by the name of Wybrow that had
[1:37:50] written an article or written a book and
[1:37:53] and she quotes him says Wybrow says that
[1:37:56] we are being pushed to the edge of our
[1:37:59] physiological
[1:38:01] and uh psychological
[1:38:03] uh limits.
[1:38:05] Uh we can't take much more. We need a
[1:38:09] new approach to both the economy and to
[1:38:12] our sense of well-being. We need to pay
[1:38:15] attention to all the subtle messages
[1:38:18] telling us to slow down. The feeling of
[1:38:22] being constantly irritable and ready to
[1:38:26] explode. The fear that we're always
[1:38:29] behind says those are some of the
[1:38:31] messages.
[1:38:33] And the world is that way.
[1:38:36] I have been irritable
[1:38:38] because of the pressure because of the
[1:38:41] time, you know, that that the the there
[1:38:45] just isn't enough time in the day
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; to get things done. And I've just
[1:38:51] decided it's not worth it.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; God's given me so much time and I'm
[1:38:57] going to just I'm going to make sure
[1:38:59] that the world only gets what it what I
[1:39:02] have to give it. I'm going to have time
[1:39:05] for my relationship
[1:39:07] with Jesus Christ
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; to be able to you have to do thing a lot
[1:39:11] of things. No, you don't have to do a
[1:39:12] lot of things, but you can sit there
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; and you can speak with him and you can
[1:39:18] have some time. People say, "Well, God
[1:39:21] doesn't speak with me." Well, you take
[1:39:23] time for it.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; I think we need to have that time.
[1:39:28] I I I think it would be it would really
[1:39:32] be an insult if we're trying to build a
[1:39:34] relationship with somebody and some of
[1:39:36] the young couples that have, you know,
[1:39:39] gone through courtship and marriage and
[1:39:40] so on so forth
[1:39:42] and as a as a family,
[1:39:46] I hope I'm not being too plain and
[1:39:48] blunt, but it just, you know, to run in
[1:39:51] and say, "Well, dear, I only have five
[1:39:53] minutes. you know, let's uh uh you know,
[1:39:55] let's have our little intimate
[1:39:57] conversation right now and then I got to
[1:39:59] be off. I got to be going. It's not
[1:40:00] going to work.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Just not going to work. We have to have
[1:40:04] time to merely be with one another and
[1:40:08] to sit with one another uh like we are
[1:40:11] here in church tonight. But we have to
[1:40:13] have time. I'm talking about our
[1:40:15] relationship with Christ. It takes time,
[1:40:18] folks. And brother Brandham talks about
[1:40:21] the 10 days that they were in the upper
[1:40:23] room. I think those 10 days did a lot of
[1:40:26] things. Brother Brandham even says Peter
[1:40:29] maybe said, "Oh, I think I got it." No,
[1:40:33] one day and two days and three days and
[1:40:36] they were all together
[1:40:38] and I I don't know what took place
[1:40:40] there, but they were but God allowed
[1:40:42] them to wait 10 days. And that was a I
[1:40:45] think an although we're not waiting 10
[1:40:47] days, but it seems to me that it's an
[1:40:49] essential part of our relationship and
[1:40:54] allowing the Holy Spirit to uh to have
[1:40:59] his way in our hearts. Now,
[1:41:03] um
[1:41:06] my
[1:41:16] when I was with brother Brandham and I'm
[1:41:19] going to close in just a moment. When I
[1:41:21] was with him, I was just a young man and
[1:41:25] I tried to observe
[1:41:28] so I could grasp
[1:41:32] what made him what he was
[1:41:35] or what God saw in him and why as a
[1:41:38] prophet I was so intrigued with that
[1:41:41] ministry.
[1:41:43] I noticed that he had time.
[1:41:48] He had time to observe
[1:41:51] and he observed simple things.
[1:41:54] And I would try to pick up what not only
[1:41:56] what he observed but why he saw that.
[1:42:00] And when he saw this Indian man saw the
[1:42:03] big patches of gunny sacks on his pants
[1:42:06] and how he sat on the horse, how he sat
[1:42:10] so straight. I was observing and he was
[1:42:13] pointing that out to me and I was asking
[1:42:15] myself inside what is it in him that
[1:42:18] sees such a simple thing when he come in
[1:42:20] here if he came in here I can guarantee
[1:42:23] you you'd be shocked with what it was
[1:42:25] that he would observe he would observe
[1:42:28] the most simple thing the thing that you
[1:42:29] and I overlook that's what he observed
[1:42:32] and he told here in detail spent time in
[1:42:34] a service told how at times square in
[1:42:38] New York that he and Billy went there
[1:42:41] and they went there because they said
[1:42:42] they were going to tear this structure
[1:42:44] down. So, they went there to take some
[1:42:46] pictures. And you know the thing that he
[1:42:48] observed, he didn't talk about the
[1:42:50] grandeur of what it was they took
[1:42:52] pictures of. He looked around. He saw
[1:42:54] the people up above and where they were
[1:42:58] and they were rushing, going here, going
[1:43:01] there. He says to Billy, "Where are they
[1:43:04] all going?
[1:43:06] Where are they all going? Where are they
[1:43:08] hurrying to?
[1:43:10] And that's what caught his attention.
[1:43:13] And I actually think that, you know,
[1:43:16] that would be a good thing for us to
[1:43:17] say. Where am I rushing to? What am I
[1:43:19] hurrying off to? Have I taken time for
[1:43:22] the real important thing? You know
[1:43:24] something, friends?
[1:43:26] uh
[1:43:28] in this body if I could just express
[1:43:31] myself tonight in this body I believe
[1:43:34] that if you could take just what I've
[1:43:36] said now on this resource of time that
[1:43:38] we have you say well what would that do
[1:43:40] about yourself think what that do right
[1:43:42] here on the platform think what that do
[1:43:44] for the man of God who's ministering
[1:43:46] here think about what that would do for
[1:43:49] someone else who's observing you and
[1:43:51] then you would encourage someone else
[1:43:52] and someone else and the whole the whole
[1:43:54] atmosphere here of the entire
[1:43:57] congregation rises higher. You begin to
[1:44:00] see God start to do things spontaneously
[1:44:03] in the congregation and prayers answered
[1:44:07] and uh unbelieving and the backslider
[1:44:11] coming back to God and the supernatural
[1:44:14] happening. Why? Because God is so
[1:44:17] pleased to dwell in that kind of an
[1:44:19] atmosphere. I say, "Oh God, that's what
[1:44:22] we want. Is that aiming too high? No. I
[1:44:26] believe that's what God has in store for
[1:44:28] us. And that resource is here. I think
[1:44:30] it just means uh depends on what we do
[1:44:34] with that resource. It's a tremendous a
[1:44:37] tremendous thing. And with this, I'm
[1:44:38] going to close.
[1:44:47] I've observed something in the last
[1:44:50] short while.
[1:44:52] I want to be very very frank with you
[1:44:57] and this is probably coming out of left
[1:45:01] field
[1:45:02] but I want to express my burden and
[1:45:06] vision
[1:45:07] for the present time.
[1:45:10] I've observed and I mentioned it just a
[1:45:12] little bit this morning.
[1:45:14] I was just you you have to try to come
[1:45:16] into my mindset now. I was just in
[1:45:19] Brazil and the message came there
[1:45:24] in 1957 which there really was no
[1:45:26] message in but it was introduced and I
[1:45:29] met the grandson of the man who brought
[1:45:31] it there
[1:45:33] and I believe this grandson is is going
[1:45:37] to have some official position down
[1:45:39] there. not not with what we were doing,
[1:45:42] but um
[1:45:44] he told me and talked to me uh quite a
[1:45:46] little about how his grandfather brought
[1:45:48] the message there. But while he's
[1:45:51] speaking and while I'm speaking now,
[1:45:53] here's another brother, brother
[1:45:55] Vanderlay, whose church we were in and
[1:45:58] seeing this church and upstairs a huge
[1:46:01] kitchen and area to feed the people.
[1:46:05] 11,200 people in the congregation
[1:46:08] probably half again as many as we have
[1:46:10] here
[1:46:11] and qualified men
[1:46:15] something happened to me only only place
[1:46:17] ever happened in the world the head
[1:46:19] deacon I understand he's a head deacon
[1:46:21] and they likened him to Tony because he
[1:46:23] just moved around so quick and so on so
[1:46:27] I was done preaching I I I stepped back
[1:46:30] I was sitting there and he he saw that I
[1:46:32] wanted to maybe slip away. So, he comes
[1:46:35] and gets me and takes me back into the
[1:46:38] pastor's study. I mean, the pastor's
[1:46:40] study is old marble floor. It's
[1:46:41] beautiful study. And takes me to the
[1:46:43] pastor's study, and I'm going to go and
[1:46:45] sit down in the pastor's chair. Oh, no.
[1:46:48] Uh, no, no, no, no, no. He doesn't speak
[1:46:50] a word of English, and I certainly don't
[1:46:51] speak any Portuguese. No. And there's a
[1:46:53] doorway there, and in in this other
[1:46:55] little room right off the pastor's study
[1:46:57] is two twin beds, and off of that is an
[1:47:00] ensuite, a bathroom with a shower and
[1:47:02] all the rest of it. And uh so you know
[1:47:06] now he and and he rushes in there and he
[1:47:09] gets a hold of the pillow and fluffs the
[1:47:10] pillow and makes motion. He wants me to
[1:47:13] lay down. Oh no. I I've never gone from
[1:47:15] the pull pit to lay down like this in
[1:47:18] the pastor's study. Oh, no. I said, "No,
[1:47:20] you know, I want to wash my face." So I
[1:47:22] go into the washroom. He in there ahead
[1:47:24] of me and I start splashing some water
[1:47:27] in my face and washing my face and he
[1:47:29] already has a big bath towel off of the
[1:47:32] off the wall and my face is all wet and
[1:47:34] he's patting my face.
[1:47:38] I loved him.
[1:47:42] I said, "I've never had this happen in
[1:47:45] my life.
[1:47:47] Just let me suffer some more like this."
[1:47:51] and he passes it up and sets that towel
[1:47:54] up and now he's got a hold of me and he
[1:47:56] takes me right over to this bed that he
[1:47:58] was so determined he fluffed the fluffed
[1:48:00] it up and and so well I thought well I
[1:48:03] I'll sit here I can sit here I he had me
[1:48:05] sat down had both of my shoes pulled off
[1:48:07] before I could even say Jack Robinson
[1:48:09] and swung my feet up on the bed and laid
[1:48:12] me down and I thought well this does
[1:48:14] feel pretty
[1:48:22] Guess what? I felt called to Brazil
[1:48:34] and I thought I I looked at these people
[1:48:37] and that's the kind of deacons they
[1:48:39] have.
[1:48:45] Amen.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, it is uh so
[1:48:55] rich
[1:48:56] in its culture and its character and its
[1:48:58] natural resources and the its modern and
[1:49:03] fine buildings and fine congregation.
[1:49:06] And I felt so sad.
[1:49:08] They have probably less than a hundred
[1:49:12] messages available to them.
[1:49:16] And as I was preaching, I I I just took
[1:49:20] three words, three words. It was so
[1:49:22] powerful statement of brother Brandham
[1:49:24] and I I had said that's three words out
[1:49:27] of one paragraph. It's just they just
[1:49:29] exploded. They just were electrified. I
[1:49:31] said, "That's just three words out of
[1:49:33] one paragraph." And perhaps you haven't
[1:49:35] you haven't even got that book.
[1:49:38] But Satan works so hard for them not to
[1:49:43] lay down little feelings,
[1:49:47] little hurts,
[1:49:49] and he just will nurture that, fertilize
[1:49:52] that, keep that thing going. So just go
[1:49:55] on year after year after year. And it's
[1:49:57] amazing how our mind says, "Well, you
[1:50:00] know, listen, this is I had people
[1:50:01] rattle things. When did this happen to
[1:50:03] me?" Well, that was about 12 12 years
[1:50:06] ago and you're still packing that thing.
[1:50:08] 15 years ago and you're still packing
[1:50:10] that thing. But we are poor humans. We
[1:50:12] do that and the devil just loves it. He
[1:50:15] just go for it. Yeah. You know, they
[1:50:18] treated you wrong and that's the way it
[1:50:20] is. I tell you what a miserable
[1:50:23] situation to live in. God deliver us.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Deliver us from that kind of thing. And
[1:50:30] it has hindered the message. And while I
[1:50:33] thought of that, probably got less than
[1:50:35] a hundred messages. I mean, really
[1:50:36] qualified messages. And I I I I so I
[1:50:39] told them, "God bless brother Timothy,
[1:50:43] brother Murphy, the brothers I've got
[1:50:45] down here, China, Vietnam, Ukraine, and
[1:50:49] now Brazil in just the last five or six
[1:50:53] years." And you heard about China this
[1:50:56] morning. Say, "What is this burden? What
[1:50:59] is my burden?" My burden and vision
[1:51:03] is to work with pastors and men of God
[1:51:07] and to see that the message gets into as
[1:51:10] many languages and get spread as far a
[1:51:12] field as it possible in the shortest
[1:51:15] possible time. That's my burden. My
[1:51:18] burden is to go into a place and
[1:51:21] evaluate what is the true need in the
[1:51:24] country. If God opens a country or opens
[1:51:27] the hearts of the people, my burden is
[1:51:29] if requested to provide counsel to men
[1:51:32] of God who have the vision for their
[1:51:34] people. My burden is to advise and to
[1:51:37] make the most efficient and economically
[1:51:39] sound and effective way to get the
[1:51:41] message and increased quantities to the
[1:51:44] nations of the people. My burden is if
[1:51:47] if necessary to offer direct assistance
[1:51:50] to the brothers to ensure that the bride
[1:51:53] of Jesus Christ is is serviced with the
[1:51:57] with the cry and the message that she so
[1:52:00] desires. My burden is to see something
[1:52:03] that is being blessed of God and where
[1:52:06] his holy presence is welcome. My burden
[1:52:08] is to make use of the most advanced
[1:52:11] technology for the purpose of getting
[1:52:13] the gospel of Jesus Christ in the light
[1:52:16] of this message to the world. And my
[1:52:18] burden is that this will require every
[1:52:21] ounce of spiritual strength and resource
[1:52:24] that we can muster. But that is my
[1:52:27] desire.
[1:52:29] Brother Brandham said in deep callth the
[1:52:31] deep.
[1:52:32] He said, "No, in the prayer line," he
[1:52:35] said, "if he rebukes you." He said,
[1:52:37] "It'll be the truth. If it's you must be
[1:52:40] willing to stand it in the audience
[1:52:42] anywhere, if he says you must know it's
[1:52:45] not me, it's him." And go make it right.
[1:52:48] The first thing you can do before you
[1:52:50] can find a a cure, you've got to find
[1:52:53] the cause before you can find the cure.
[1:52:56] And so I'm sorry I've been a little bit
[1:52:59] long, but I got this message from the
[1:53:04] burden that came on my heart when I was
[1:53:06] in this country. And you I you can't
[1:53:08] look at a nation of 180 million people
[1:53:10] and see these churches and see these
[1:53:12] people and see these believers and see
[1:53:14] such wonderful deacons as I just
[1:53:16] described to you and fine godly men of
[1:53:20] God as pastors and see them
[1:53:24] and and and the thing that was so
[1:53:30] uh uh
[1:53:32] I was unable to grasp it was I was just
[1:53:34] incapable of grasping and as the first
[1:53:37] time I encountered it that they were
[1:53:39] content
[1:53:41] with what they had because it just
[1:53:43] seemed as though it wasn't going to come
[1:53:45] to them that they weren't going to
[1:53:48] really get it and they they didn't
[1:53:51] really have they wondered it was like
[1:53:54] too good a thing to believe that we were
[1:53:57] going to stand by them and that's why
[1:54:00] brother Tony stayed there he didn't want
[1:54:01] to stay there he'd love to be here he'd
[1:54:03] love to be with his wife love to be in
[1:54:05] this church tonight he didn't want to
[1:54:06] stay there, but he's going from brother
[1:54:08] to brother and church and it's a huge
[1:54:10] nation and seeking and letting them know
[1:54:12] we are here, brethren. We will stand
[1:54:15] with you. We we will put whatever
[1:54:17] resources we can and you as a church,
[1:54:21] you're the people that are supporting
[1:54:24] with prayer and with giving and whatever
[1:54:27] more. and friends because our time is
[1:54:30] limited because we only have a small
[1:54:33] resource of time. I say to this
[1:54:35] congregation, I trust that you
[1:54:39] see what my burden and my vision is. And
[1:54:43] and and I believe that
[1:54:47] you'll understand if I say this. God has
[1:54:51] raised I'm going to say it plain. God
[1:54:52] has raised up this place and is going to
[1:54:55] need is going to need the full effect of
[1:54:59] every member of the bride of Jesus
[1:55:02] Christ. I'm not talking about finances.
[1:55:05] I finances is is down the ladder as far
[1:55:08] as I'm concerned, but a body that moves
[1:55:10] together. A body that's in harmony. A
[1:55:13] body that exercises the law of love and
[1:55:16] unity and striving endeavoring for the
[1:55:19] unity of the faith. a body where the
[1:55:21] Holy Spirit is so pleased and we come
[1:55:23] together and it's electric. It's just
[1:55:26] electrifying what God has done. I
[1:55:28] wouldn't want to be accountable for
[1:55:29] having held back the spirit of God in a
[1:55:32] meeting when there's people crying out,
[1:55:34] "Oh God, come amongst us. Move mightily.
[1:55:39] Don't let anything hinder you." Hear the
[1:55:42] God of creation come amongst us. Does
[1:55:45] the people say, "Amen." Glory to God.
[1:55:48] That's what your desire is. I believe if
[1:55:51] we move in that direction, even that
[1:55:53] some that may not be as committed as as
[1:55:55] others at this moment, but I believe
[1:55:57] we'll be a force. It'll be a powerful
[1:55:59] force. And it will move others. It'll
[1:56:02] move others. It'll move those that are
[1:56:04] slower, but they will see that someone
[1:56:06] has taken a real stand, a real step. And
[1:56:08] now we're going to use these resources
[1:56:10] that God has given us. The strength that
[1:56:13] we have, what one person can't do, we'll
[1:56:16] do as a unit.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; We'll do together. Hallelujah.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; When we come together in the house of
[1:56:22] God and whoever it is stand behind the
[1:56:24] pulpit, he knows he has the support of
[1:56:26] the people. He knows they've been in
[1:56:28] prayer. He knows they've had a personal
[1:56:30] relationship and they have been talking
[1:56:33] to Christ. No wonder he'll come down and
[1:56:37] anoint us. Hallelujah. I'm taking a
[1:56:39] little extra time, friends, but this
[1:56:41] thing is burning on my soul. That God
[1:56:44] has raised up this place. He's raised up
[1:56:47] this place to be a testimony. And I see
[1:56:50] that the nations that God has allowed us
[1:56:52] to to to work in and to function in the
[1:56:55] brethren that God has given and all we
[1:56:57] are is assisting them. I think of the
[1:57:00] Philippines and what is happening there.
[1:57:02] I tell you what, that office that's in
[1:57:04] the Philippines, that's not just an
[1:57:06] office. That's a work of God.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Everything. I tell you what, even
[1:57:14] believers so-called have worked against
[1:57:16] that and have I've gotten long long
[1:57:19] pages like that of of of ministers names
[1:57:22] who said we don't accept the books that
[1:57:24] come. They think we're printing books.
[1:57:26] We don't print books. It's the pastors
[1:57:28] over there print the books and the
[1:57:30] people over here in America just pay pay
[1:57:32] to have them printed. But they they've
[1:57:35] raised up and one of the first
[1:57:36] scriptures I read to the brothers in in
[1:57:39] Brazil was and a great door and
[1:57:41] effectual is opened unto me. Paul said
[1:57:44] and conjunction word there are many
[1:57:48] adversaries. And I said to the pastors
[1:57:50] as soon as you start to try to do
[1:57:51] something good for God evil will be
[1:57:54] right there. You'll try to do something
[1:57:56] and amazing it's not from without. Many
[1:57:58] times it's from within. Number one, lack
[1:58:02] of support, not financial support. Being
[1:58:05] right behind the vision, not being able
[1:58:08] to not be able to commit themselves and
[1:58:10] say, "Brother Ed, Brother Biscll,
[1:58:12] whoever, whatever you've called me, you
[1:58:14] say, I see what's happening, Brother
[1:58:16] Tony, Brother Ernie, I see what's
[1:58:18] happening, and I may maybe I'm not very
[1:58:20] vocal. Maybe I'm not upfront. Maybe I'm
[1:58:22] not very visible. I want you to know I'm
[1:58:24] behind it because I see what's
[1:58:26] happening."
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:30] And that's all we need.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; And then we'll do whatever God allows us
[1:58:34] to do.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; And when you have, brethren, here I'm
[1:58:37] kind of standing in the middle. I'm
[1:58:39] coming here conveying to you the burden,
[1:58:42] the burden, not of one or two men, the
[1:58:44] burden of maybe two, 300 ministers in
[1:58:47] Brazil saying, "Don't leave us.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Don't leave us.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Help us put this together. We don't know
[1:58:55] how to do it. We don't have the wisdom.
[1:58:57] We've never done it. We don't know. We
[1:58:59] don't have the experience. Stay with us.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; I say to the congregation, are you
[1:59:03] willing to stay with them?
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Willing to stay with them?
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Willing to support them?
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; You willing to say, "Do what you can,
[1:59:10] brother Ed. Do what you can, Brother
[1:59:12] Tony." Pray for Brother Tony tonight.
[1:59:15] We're with you.
[1:59:17] That's what we need.
[1:59:22] Thank you. God bless you. And through
[1:59:23] that then we're able to express to these
[1:59:27] brethren, brother Netto, brother uh
[1:59:30] Vanderlay, some of these brethren, they
[1:59:33] just those two I've just mentioned there
[1:59:34] at least 3,000 believers
[1:59:38] as they were here you'd love them
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; and as soon as you'd embrace them you'd
[1:59:43] say I got 1100 messages they got 100.
[1:59:48] That's what I feel. I take those
[1:59:50] brothers, those pastors by the neck and
[1:59:52] shake their hand and say he he's maybe
[1:59:55] got 70
[1:59:58] and I got,00
[2:00:00] and I'm going to walk out of here
[2:00:02] feeling great.
[2:00:04] I feel heartbroken. I come home and
[2:00:07] think that they're play politics with
[2:00:09] this message. Say you can't get it out.
[2:00:11] You can't I tell you there isn't any
[2:00:13] power in heaven or hell that's going to
[2:00:15] stop when this word from getting out.
[2:00:19] going to get it to those people. And I
[2:00:21] believe we need to we need to support
[2:00:23] that kind of thing
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; in the Ukraine. In the Ukraine and I
[2:00:32] close, I promise in the Ukraine
[2:00:35] there the first time and all 70
[2:00:38] ministers, some from Armenia. I said
[2:00:40] Armenia, my goodness, from Usbekistsan.
[2:00:44] Is it pastors I never thought I'd ever
[2:00:46] see. You mean the message got there?
[2:00:48] Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, how wonderful. He
[2:00:51] said, "Can you help us? Can we get
[2:00:53] books?" I I I don't know what the what's
[2:00:56] happening with the books. We didn't go
[2:00:57] there for that. I said, "Do you have
[2:00:59] books? Do you have message books?" And
[2:01:01] and the first brother said, "I I've only
[2:01:03] gotten the last book I got is in
[2:01:06] Russian. The last book I got was two and
[2:01:08] a half years ago." And this brother
[2:01:10] says, "The last one I got was about
[2:01:11] three years ago."
[2:01:14] and uh
[2:01:17] and a great door and actor was open. But
[2:01:20] there are many adversaries
[2:01:24] and if we stop because there's an
[2:01:25] adversary but we keep pursuing.
[2:01:28] Hallelujah. We keep pushing many
[2:01:31] difficulties but you don't give up.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; We don't give up.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; The body of Jesus Christ doesn't know to
[2:01:38] give up. Even when Jesus was weary, he
[2:01:41] didn't quit. When we're weary, we don't
[2:01:44] quit.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; He was tired, but he had compassion on
[2:01:48] the people. And this body of Christ
[2:01:50] hasn't changed. We get weary, but we
[2:01:53] don't give up.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; And we still have compassion.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; And we expand ourselves as a as a bride,
[2:02:01] a body of Christ. I see what happens in
[2:02:04] the church. I see an event like
[2:02:06] yesterday. I see the sisters. I see your
[2:02:08] labor. I see what you do. I say, "God
[2:02:11] bless you." I take people through the
[2:02:13] school. I tell you what, you teachers
[2:02:15] and you that are involved there, I say
[2:02:18] it, it's not just school workers on the
[2:02:20] wall. It's love hangs on the wall.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; And people come through and they say
[2:02:24] that. And today
[2:02:28] they're getting two messages a month in
[2:02:31] the Ukraine.
[2:02:33] Two a month. Last one I saw was it said
[2:02:36] two and a half years and one says three
[2:02:38] years. Two a month. I ask you as a
[2:02:41] congregation, does that deserve just a
[2:02:44] prayer? Does that deserve our united
[2:02:48] heart, a a feeling from our soul and our
[2:02:51] spirit and say, "God bless every brother
[2:02:54] that has any hand in doing that." And
[2:02:57] may they know that we are here to
[2:03:00] support them in prayer in whatever way
[2:03:03] that we can. Ah, if they see or the
[2:03:06] streaming of the video, they'll see my
[2:03:08] hand up. They'll see the glory of God on
[2:03:10] my face. They'll see me sitting in my
[2:03:13] seat in my place. I've gone over there.
[2:03:15] You'd be surprised. They say, "Who's
[2:03:17] that brother? Who's that sister? I
[2:03:18] notice they're not there now. Where are
[2:03:20] they?" I said, "Well, they're sitting on
[2:03:22] the other side of the church." Oh, then
[2:03:24] they feel better. They thought they
[2:03:26] weren't there anymore. And my wife says,
[2:03:28] "They keep better track of our people
[2:03:29] than we do. It's amazing because they
[2:03:32] live with it." Well, to God be the
[2:03:35] glory. Great things that he's done. and
[2:03:37] let you know we'll be as faithful and as
[2:03:40] burdened servants as we possibly can be.
[2:03:42] And I let the devil know tonight that
[2:03:45] there is absolutely no adversary. There
[2:03:47] is no weapon that he can form that's
[2:03:50] going to stop this message, going to
[2:03:52] stop this bride. And to me, it's a
[2:03:54] beautiful, spotless bride, virtuous,
[2:03:57] married to the lamb of God.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:02] That's what I think about this bride.
[2:04:04] That's what I think about her. I say,
[2:04:06] "God bless you." We've got a couple that
[2:04:08] are going to be baptized. I wonder if we
[2:04:10] could just stand and sing while they go
[2:04:12] to be uh get ready to be baptized.
[2:04:15] Forgive me for being a little bit long,
[2:04:16] but I think that we have sufficient time
[2:04:19] to me unbburden myself. I'd like to just
[2:04:21] sing to God be the glory. Great things
[2:04:23] he's done. Brother Rod, maybe you could
[2:04:26] uh help us lead in that.
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:41] He the world that he gave us his son to
[2:04:48] yielded
[2:04:49] his life and I to sin
[2:04:54] and open the floodgate that all may go
[2:05:00] in. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

[2:05:09] Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the people
[2:05:13] rejoice.

[2:05:20] son and give him the glory. Great things
[2:05:26] he have done.
[2:05:29] Oh perfect
[2:05:31] redemption. The purchase of blood to
[2:05:36] every believer.
[2:05:39] The promise of God.
[2:05:42] The viest
[2:05:44] defender who truly believes
[2:05:49] that moment from Jesus upon every.
[2:05:55] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let
[2:05:59] the earth hear it.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

[2:06:42] wonderful

[2:06:47] Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

[2:09:47] [Music]
[2:09:53] And you can have your seats.
[2:09:57] Very appropriate song for he had done
[2:10:00] great things. Tonight we have two of our
[2:10:03] our young people being baptized. Jamina
[2:10:05] Waldner, Brother Michael, Sister Helen's
[2:10:08] daughter. I was thinking Mike 30 some
[2:10:12] odd years ago
[2:10:14] as Mike heard the voice of God
[2:10:17] and
[2:10:19] actually almost lived in a car and I was
[2:10:22] blessed to have him come and live in my
[2:10:25] apartment. I was a single man and I
[2:10:28] always I had the three-month plan. The
[2:10:30] three-month plan is you live with me
[2:10:32] three months, you better have a job and
[2:10:35] out you go and spread your wings. We had
[2:10:38] some great times of fellowship. Brother
[2:10:39] Mike, great man who loves the word of
[2:10:42] God. And we're blessed here, Jamina, to
[2:10:45] have you here, a daughter standing.
[2:10:49] The scripture says this in in 1 Samuel
[2:10:51] and three,
[2:10:54] it says, "An heir the lamp of God went
[2:10:56] out in the temple of the Lord where the
[2:10:57] ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down
[2:10:59] to sleep that the Lord called Samuel and
[2:11:04] he answered," Here am I.
[2:11:09] We have brother Timothy Andy's also to
[2:11:12] be baptized. We have Jamina Waldner
[2:11:13] that's standing in the waters of
[2:11:15] baptism.
[2:11:17] And the wonderful thing about each one
[2:11:18] of their testimony is that each one has
[2:11:21] heard the voice of God.
[2:11:25] That is a tremendous thing.
[2:11:28] And I believe it's so tremendous because
[2:11:31] the same voice that spoke to Samuel is
[2:11:35] the same voice that spoke to them to go
[2:11:38] on with God. The Bible goes on to say in
[2:11:42] in John chapter 5, verily verily I say
[2:11:47] unto thee, the time is coming and now is
[2:11:51] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[2:11:53] the son of God. So I believe it's very
[2:11:56] important that a person hears this
[2:11:57] voice. And Jamina, you've heard it as a
[2:12:01] young girl. Just a few years ago, God
[2:12:05] dealt with her to surrender her life to
[2:12:07] Christ, to walk on, give herself to the
[2:12:12] Lord. And you know, as time goes on,
[2:12:15] sometimes it just gets a little bit
[2:12:17] distant. Little bit distant. But the
[2:12:19] Lord is faithful. The Lord is very
[2:12:22] faithful. And sister Jimmy is very quick
[2:12:24] to say, "I've heard the voice of God
[2:12:27] again, and I want to be obedient to the
[2:12:31] voice." You know, there's a lot of
[2:12:32] people that hear voices.
[2:12:36] Brother Ram said, "There's many voices
[2:12:37] today. That's to deaden the voice of the
[2:12:41] supernatural." A lot of people hear the
[2:12:43] voice and they might even hear the
[2:12:45] message and they might even uh maybe
[2:12:48] say, you know, God's dealing with me.
[2:12:51] But it's another thing to respond
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; to the voice.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; And Sister Jamina, that's what I want
[2:12:58] you to understand now. Not Not only did
[2:13:01] God speak to you, but now you've
[2:13:04] responded to him. You were pricricked in
[2:13:07] your heart just as they were in the book
[2:13:09] of Acts. They heard the word and were
[2:13:12] pricricked. Peter said, "Repent and be
[2:13:14] baptized every one of you in the name of
[2:13:16] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[2:13:19] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:13:20] Holy Ghost." This baptism is not the end
[2:13:24] all. The baptism of fire, that's when a
[2:13:28] son and daughter is birthed by the word
[2:13:29] of God. Sister Jamina, may God grant to
[2:13:33] you your desires for the things of God.
[2:13:36] Let's pray.
[2:13:46] Father,
[2:13:48] I believe you've ordained this time that
[2:13:51] Jamina is standing in the waters
[2:13:53] tonight.
[2:13:55] Lord, something has tugged at her heart.
[2:13:58] She's responded. She said, "Yes, Lord.
[2:14:00] Yes to your will and to your way." And
[2:14:05] Father, she's responded desired to be
[2:14:08] filled with God. She's repented. She has
[2:14:11] given her life to you. And now, Lord
[2:14:14] Jesus, she wants and desires to be
[2:14:16] identified not only in your death, Lord,
[2:14:19] but in your resurrection. So, I'm
[2:14:21] praying, God, you fill her with the Holy
[2:14:23] Ghost. Make her such an example and a
[2:14:26] light of your glory. Lord, may the
[2:14:28] spirit of God and a spirit of meekness
[2:14:29] and grace be her portion. And may God,
[2:14:32] you ever lead her faithfully is our
[2:14:35] prayer. I commit her now your divine
[2:14:37] care in Jesus name. Sister Jamina, by
[2:14:41] your confession
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ is your personal
[2:14:44] savior. I baptize you in the name of our
[2:14:47] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; I want that kind of blessing. I want I
[2:15:00] want
[2:15:03] I want I want that kind of blessing that
[2:15:10] saves and keeps and satisfies the soul.
[2:15:15] I want I want that full salvation
[2:15:22] to build of heaven for me. Oh, I want I
[2:15:28] want I want the kind of blessing that
[2:15:34] saves me and keeps me and satisfies my
[2:15:38] soul. I want Yes, I want that full
[2:15:44] salvation
[2:15:45] till
[2:15:47] of heaven's glory.
[2:15:51] [Music]
[2:15:52] Come on here, brother Timothy.
[2:15:55] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; We've got a real jewel standing here
[2:16:01] tonight. Timothy Andes,
[2:16:04] God has spoken sovereignly.
[2:16:07] Spoken sovereignly, too. And that's what
[2:16:09] you always look for. You know, so often
[2:16:12] as I told both Jamina and Tim, different
[2:16:15] ones come into the office and many are
[2:16:18] even here yet now and they've come and
[2:16:21] we've talked to them and dealt with them
[2:16:23] in the scriptures and just come and say,
[2:16:25] "Well, I feel I need to be baptized, but
[2:16:27] it's because of my friend or because of
[2:16:30] this or because of that." And we just
[2:16:32] felt, well, we'll just hold on.
[2:16:36] But when it's of God, it's a marvelous
[2:16:39] thing. I've never hurried for one. I've
[2:16:42] taken the time from going from the
[2:16:44] scriptures. We sit down, we cover it. We
[2:16:47] want them to know that this is the most
[2:16:49] important event for them.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; It is because the scripture says,
[2:16:56] "Saints of God, repent." That's that's
[2:16:57] the word of God. And be baptized every
[2:17:00] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:17:02] for the remission of sins. And you know,
[2:17:04] there's people that come here often that
[2:17:05] don't do that.
[2:17:07] The Bible says to him, "You shall be
[2:17:08] filled with the Holy Ghost." And that is
[2:17:11] a desire of every son and daughter of
[2:17:13] God is be filled of God and be used of
[2:17:15] God, whatever God has. And I've watched
[2:17:18] Brother Tim over the last few meetings
[2:17:19] and and God's dealt with you, Tim,
[2:17:21] hasn't he over the last few months. And
[2:17:24] the marvelous thing about this and this
[2:17:26] is a marvelous marvelous thing. Brother
[2:17:30] John was away in meetings and brother
[2:17:33] Timothy is here in the house of God and
[2:17:36] brother John calls me up and he says I
[2:17:38] believe if you just be tender I believe
[2:17:40] the Lord's dealing with Timothy. I say
[2:17:43] that's right. I believe he is too. And
[2:17:45] sure enough Tim doesn't know of our
[2:17:47] conversation and God confirms the word
[2:17:50] and I say that is a great thing. It's a
[2:17:53] great thing. And Tim has come on his own
[2:17:55] desire. Maybe you'd like to give a
[2:17:57] testimony, Tim.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; I just want to say thank you to the Lord
[2:18:02] for letting me be here. And I just want
[2:18:04] to thank him for all the things he's
[2:18:06] done in my life.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, let's pray.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, I
[2:18:18] I see a young man that has responded to
[2:18:21] the beckoning of the
[2:18:23] I pray God that you will ever keep your
[2:18:26] hand upon his life. And Father, that he
[2:18:29] could be an example to other children
[2:18:32] that would be around him. Lord, give him
[2:18:34] such a love for the word of God. Lord,
[2:18:37] that same one that spoke to Samuel, may
[2:18:39] you continue to speak to him on a daily
[2:18:41] basis, Lord, in his little prayer closet
[2:18:43] as he shuts himself away at night, Lord,
[2:18:46] to read your word. May he become a
[2:18:48] soldier of the faith. May you anoint him
[2:18:50] in a young age, Lord God, to hold the
[2:18:53] banner of your word up high. Father, we
[2:18:56] just commit him now to you in Jesus
[2:18:58] name. And brother Timothy, by your
[2:19:01] confession that Jesus Christ is your
[2:19:04] savior, I baptize you in the name of our
[2:19:07] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:19:13] [Applause]
[2:19:22] Let's turn on the screen to number 2333
[2:19:25] and then we'll close in prayer.
[2:19:30] We can stand together. It is burning in
[2:19:33] my soul. Amen. The love and kindle flame
[2:19:36] is burning in my soul. How many seen
[2:19:38] something on fire? Amen. You've seen
[2:19:41] something on fire behind this pulpit
[2:19:42] tonight.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when something's on fire, what
[2:19:45] happens if it gets near something else
[2:19:46] that's flammable, right? It starts
[2:19:48] burning, too. Amen.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; And you're going to be going out this
[2:19:52] week and you're going to be rubbing
[2:19:53] shoulders with people in the world that
[2:19:56] you know would love to be like a wet
[2:19:58] blanket, right? And you can set them on
[2:20:01] fire. Amen. Not through you, but it's
[2:20:03] the Holy Ghost living through you. Amen.
[2:20:07] You heard tonight what the burden of
[2:20:09] this church is. Amen. What the burden of
[2:20:10] our pastors, that's the burden of this
[2:20:12] church. It's my burden. Amen. Should be
[2:20:14] your burden, too. And you should go
[2:20:16] through, you know, some people they look
[2:20:18] at things and they say and they should
[2:20:20] see obstacles,
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; you know. But I'm thankful that our
[2:20:25] pastor sees a goal and he doesn't worry
[2:20:28] about how what Satan what roadblock
[2:20:31] Satan's going to put in the way cuz you
[2:20:32] know he is. You just know, hey, I got
[2:20:34] the Lord on my side. We're going to go
[2:20:35] through all those obst obstacles. Amen.
[2:20:38] We're going to get the job done. Amen.
[2:20:40] We know what the burden is. And what
[2:20:41] each one of us should be praying is,
[2:20:42] Lord, what would you have me to do to
[2:20:44] further that burden? Amen. To accomplish
[2:20:47] the goal so that God could burn. Amen.
[2:20:50] Burn through each and every one of us.
[2:20:51] Let's sing it together as a real
[2:20:53] confession. God sent his mighty power to
[2:20:58] this poor sinful heart to keep me every
[2:21:02] hour and needful.

[2:21:10] supreme control, the loving kindle

[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:24:28] Oh God, our hearts are just burning with
[2:24:31] love and appreciation and gratitude for
[2:24:34] your mercies, for your grace, for all
[2:24:37] the wonderful blessings you've bestowed
[2:24:39] in our lives, Father.
[2:24:43] Father, how thankful we are tonight,
[2:24:45] Lord, that you've come in this time,
[2:24:47] Lord, and have spoken to us like a
[2:24:50] father that truly loves his children.
[2:24:53] Father, we thank you for the divine
[2:24:54] instruction that you've brought to our
[2:24:56] hearts and to our lives and to our homes
[2:24:59] and to our families, Father, as to how
[2:25:02] we should conduct our lives at as
[2:25:05] Christians, as believers, Father. And we
[2:25:08] heard from thy divine throne of grace
[2:25:11] and mercy tonight, Father, that all the
[2:25:14] attributes and resources that we need,
[2:25:16] Father, to overcome and to empower our
[2:25:19] lives and to empower the the the world
[2:25:22] with your love, Father, is within us,
[2:25:25] Father. You've deposited us, oh, Father,
[2:25:28] the power that we need to overcome. The
[2:25:31] power that we need to conquer, Father.
[2:25:33] The power that we need, oh Father, to go
[2:25:36] forward in this great battle to win. For
[2:25:39] you have told us we are victorious and
[2:25:42] we are more than conquerors through
[2:25:44] Jesus Christ our Lord.
[2:25:47] We thank you, oh God, for the burden
[2:25:49] that you've laid upon our pastor
[2:25:51] tonight, Father. And we share that
[2:25:53] burden, Father. And we just ask oh God
[2:25:56] tonight Lord that you will just anoint
[2:25:59] this church father as you have blessed
[2:26:02] us oh God to go forward and to spread
[2:26:04] the word. Let it be oh father a vision
[2:26:08] that is empowering each and every member
[2:26:10] of this congregation.
[2:26:13] Father, we pray, oh God, that you will
[2:26:15] take each one of us, Father, each member
[2:26:18] of this precious mystical body of Christ
[2:26:22] and use us in our in your own special
[2:26:25] way.
[2:26:27] Use us from the youngest to the oldest.
[2:26:30] Father,
[2:26:32] let love permeate this church. Oh God,
[2:26:37] help us to give away and to set aside
[2:26:39] our differences, Father. For there is no
[2:26:43] unbelief in the body of Christ,
[2:26:47] but perfect love. We've heard it, Lord,
[2:26:50] tonight. We've heard it from the heart
[2:26:53] of your servant, oh Father. It is come
[2:26:55] from you, Lord. It's not a pastor, but
[2:26:58] it's you crying out, crying out to this
[2:27:02] congregation, Father. Oh, help us, dear
[2:27:05] God, that this word would not just be
[2:27:09] something that came to our thoughts, but
[2:27:11] something that you've called us to live
[2:27:14] out. Something that, oh God, only you
[2:27:16] can live through us. I pray, heavenly
[2:27:19] father, that as of tonight, oh father,
[2:27:24] this church will be different.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; You've only spoken this way because we
[2:27:30] needed to hear what we've heard today.
[2:27:33] Not just one service, Father, but
[2:27:36] service after service. You've used your
[2:27:38] servants, Brother Tom, Brother Dier,
[2:27:41] Brother Ernie, Father, and you're
[2:27:43] constantly trying to help us to see the
[2:27:46] greater vision. Oh dear God, defeat
[2:27:50] Satan tonight, Lord. Because it's him
[2:27:52] that is coming amongst your people
[2:27:55] because he saw he sees his defeat and we
[2:27:58] conquer him by the word and the
[2:28:00] testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:28:03] Tonight, Father, we defeat every disease
[2:28:07] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:28:09] Christ. Tonight, every hindering spirit
[2:28:11] is defeated and we'll go forward in the
[2:28:14] Holy Spirit, oh God, to conquer every
[2:28:17] obstacle that lays before us. And we
[2:28:20] ask, God, Father, that you will bless
[2:28:22] this church, Father, and continue to use
[2:28:25] us for the glory of God. We commit our
[2:28:28] lives to you, Lord. We lay our lives
[2:28:31] down at your feet tonight, after what
[2:28:34] you've spoken tonight, Father. Oh God,
[2:28:37] we see the fire that is burning in our
[2:28:39] pastor. Let that fire be burning in each
[2:28:41] and every one of your children. Help us,
[2:28:44] oh God, to go forth this week, Father,
[2:28:46] to leave in victory. Help us, oh Lord,
[2:28:49] to be so burning that others may see
[2:28:52] your good works and glorify your Father,
[2:28:54] which is in heaven. May all the glory
[2:28:56] and honor be to you, Father. We thank
[2:28:59] you for this wonderful day that we've
[2:29:01] had in your presence. We thank you for
[2:29:03] coming, Lord, and just speaking to us
[2:29:06] and being with us, Father, and
[2:29:08] encouraging us to go forward, Father,
[2:29:11] for we have the power in the name of our
[2:29:13] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Bless your
[2:29:16] people, Father. Help us, oh Lord, to go
[2:29:19] forward, Lord, each family, Father, to
[2:29:22] take these things and meditate upon
[2:29:24] them, and may they become a part of our
[2:29:27] living, Lord. We ask these things in the
[2:29:29] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[2:29:32] for your honor and glory. Amen and amen.
[2:29:39] And let's sing together as we are
[2:29:41] dismissed. Burn, burn. Holy Spirit, burn
[2:29:43] in me. Set my soul on fire.
[2:29:48] Burn, burn, Holy Spirit, burn me.

[2:30:17] healing and raising the dead.

[2:30:28] through the Shake the hand of your
[2:30:30] brothers, your sisters. Say, "God bless
[2:30:32] you. You're dismissed." Burn, burn, Holy
