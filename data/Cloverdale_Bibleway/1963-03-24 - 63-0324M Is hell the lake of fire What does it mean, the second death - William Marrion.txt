TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right question is hell and the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone the same no hell translation in the Bible I believe the scholar sitting here want to honor that our brother Iverson sitting here and brother n and many of these Brethren who are really theologians the word translated had means the grave is that right the Greek word for the grave but the lake of far is something else because over in Revelations both Hades and all was cast into the Lake of Fire all right now let's see uh is the Lake of Fire hell Eternal no sir anything that was created is not Eternal if anybody ever tells you that you go to burn in an eternal hell I want the scripture for there's no such a thing as that hell was created for the devil and his angels for the Antichrist and his people that was the devil incarnate devil is created for that to destroy out of everything there is the whole world and everything else there's only one thing Eternal and that's God before there was a Adam or electrons or before there was even Cosmic like electrons or anything he was God he's a Creator and that's the only way you can be Eternal is to receive eternal life that re word there I think is Zoe isn't that right Zoe Zoe and then that that life God imparts to you as the father your father imparts his life to you the revelation of St John the Divine chapter 20 and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire thou son of man the children of thy people still are talking against theee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to another everyone to his brother saying come I pray you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord and they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit before thee as my people and they hear thy words but they will not do them for with their mouth they show much love but their heart goeth after their covetousness and lo Thou Art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear thy words but they do them not and when this cometh to pass Lo it will come then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them
