[19:37] glory
[19:39] how many believe that
[19:42] it is from glory to glory victory to
[19:44] victory
[19:46] amen so i was going to ask
[19:48] how many
[19:49] have a pentecostal jubilee and i don't
[19:52] want to say since last camp
[19:55] since last night
[19:58] so i'm asking you the question how many

[20:02] a pentecostal jubilee since last night
[20:06] don't be shy now come on we're at camp
[20:12] and i'm not talking about the
[20:13] organization i'm talking about an
[20:14] experience a life-changing experience
[20:18] amen many people can say a lot about it
[20:21] amen but i think
[20:23] listen to what the prophet says if
[20:25] pentecost started off back there with
[20:27] that kind of a free and going
[20:29] free-hearted and free in the spirit and
[20:32] everything i think you better go and you
[20:35] do your first works over again

[20:41] landmark again
[20:43] where it started
[20:45] listen i'm not done yet
[20:47] come back again to believing in god come
[20:50] back to letting the holy spirit have its
[20:52] way in your heart to worshiping god in
[20:56] the spirit and doing like they used to
[20:59] do
[21:01] get that old starchy indifferent feeling
[21:04] away from you
[21:09] get that old starchy
[21:11] feeling away from you
[21:13] maybe some people don't like it when i
[21:14] say it but like brother brother wayne
[21:16] said it you have to take the whole book
[21:19] the whole message
[21:21] amen so get that that starchy feeling in
[21:24] different way from you amen oh you can't
[21:28] have a church like that

[24:48] meet somebody or no matter what the
[24:50] reason is
[24:53] one thing is sure god has an appointment
[24:55] with you here
[25:00] and god never fails
[25:04] and if there is anything we've received
[25:06] a blessing yesterday god was so good to
[25:09] us but we want another blessing this
[25:11] morning
[25:12] amen so no matter what it is amen isaiah
[25:16] he speaks about the spirit of heaviness
[25:19] so if there is anything
[25:20] left yet here that is is bolting you
[25:23] down that is keeping you bound any
[25:26] spirit of heaviness my prayer is this
[25:28] morning that it may be changed amen in a
[25:32] garment of praise
[25:34] as thus said the prophet isaiah
[25:39] in a garment of praise
[25:42] hallelujah
[25:44] and i want to talk about the main thing
[25:46] jesus christ
[25:48] while you go to
[25:51] the book of ephesians 1
[25:54] i just want to tell you story before we
[25:56] read it
[25:57] where brother branham he speaks about
[26:00] probably you heard it
[26:02] about
[26:03] this
[26:04] poor man and
[26:06] he
[26:07] he found this flower
[26:10] and he takes this flower and this flower
[26:12] says
[26:13] you know whatever you ask
[26:16] i'll give it to you
[26:18] of course it's a story
[26:20] and i hear this man he says well if i'm
[26:23] a poor man if you could open
[26:25] this mountain
[26:29] and i could find gold riches
[26:32] i would be such a happy man
[26:35] so
[26:36] the mountain opens up
[26:38] here he goes he sees all this gold
[26:41] diamonds whatever you name it
[26:45] takes as much as he can
[26:47] but the flower said
[26:49] i will always have to be with you
[26:52] now he takes whatever he can carry
[26:56] goes
[26:57] out flower says hey
[26:59] don't forget me now
[27:01] oh yeah
[27:02] while he comes back
[27:04] oh there's still another bigger diamond
[27:06] let me take that one so i must show my
[27:09] friends i'm no poor man anymore i'm a
[27:10] rich man now
[27:12] flower says
[27:15] don't forget
[27:16] the main thing here
[27:18] oh yeah that's right maybe in my left
[27:19] pocket i still have some space left
[27:22] take some more
[27:24] eventually
[27:25] he goes out flower says don't forget the
[27:28] main thing
[27:29] he said oh shut up and goes
[27:32] and everything closes
[27:35] because he forgot the main thing now i'm
[27:38] talking spiritually brother branham uses
[27:39] it as a story as an example but i'm
[27:42] talking spiritually here
[27:44] don't forget the main thing
[27:46] the main thing of camp is we can have
[27:49] activities they're wonderful we love
[27:51] them
[27:52] but the main thing is to have jesus
[27:54] christ to have a life-changing
[27:57] experience amen we can have activities
[28:00] and other activities amen but one
[28:02] encounter with god is changing you
[28:05] completely
[28:07] and that's what these meetings are all
[28:08] about
[28:10] amen so ephesians 1
[28:12] verse 17
[28:14] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[28:16] the father of glory may give unto you
[28:19] the spirit of wisdom and revelation and
[28:21] the knowledge of him the eyes of our
[28:23] understanding being enlightened that you
[28:26] may know what is the hope of his calling
[28:28] and what the riches of the glory of his
[28:30] inheritance in the saints verse 19 and
[28:33] what is the exceeding greatness
[28:36] and and and the lexicon
[28:38] in greatness says megatoss meaning
[28:41] magnitude the exceeding magnitude of his
[28:44] power then the the lexicon says dynamis
[28:48] it's a force
[28:49] a miraculous power a strength a resource
[28:54] a host
[28:55] listen not done yet power residing in a
[28:59] thing by virtue of its nature
[29:04] so and what is the exceeding greatness
[29:07] of his power to us word
[29:10] who believe
[29:11] according to the working of his mighty
[29:13] power which he wrought in christ when he
[29:15] raised him from the dead and set him at
[29:17] his own right hand in the heavenly
[29:19] places far above all principality and
[29:22] power and might and dominion and every
[29:25] name that is named not only in this
[29:27] world but also in that which is to come
[29:29] and had put all things under his feet
[29:32] and gave him to be the head over all
[29:35] things to the church which is his body
[29:37] the fullness of him that fill it all in
[29:40] all
[29:41] the amplified of verse 22 and 23 says
[29:44] and he put all things in every realm in
[29:47] subjection under christ's feet and
[29:50] appointed him as supreme and
[29:53] authoritative head over all things in
[29:56] the church which is his body the
[29:58] fullness of him who fills and completes
[30:01] all things
[30:02] in all
[30:04] may god add the blessing to the reading
[30:06] of his word let's have a word of prayer
[30:09] our dear heavenly father
[30:11] lord once again we counted such a great
[30:13] honor and privilege
[30:15] lord to be standing here on holy ground
[30:18] father lord this is not just another
[30:20] meeting lord this is an encounter with
[30:23] you father lord we know that we are
[30:25] standing on holy ground angels are all
[30:28] around father because you are here to
[30:30] meet us to bless us to fill us to change
[30:33] us and lord god we pray oh may you give
[30:36] us a greater revelation lord to each and
[30:39] every one of us father may we know our
[30:42] position lord and father god may you
[30:45] take full control over the service lord
[30:47] and take
[30:48] take me out of the way father and may
[30:50] you speak through me lord god and oh
[30:53] break break the bread of life to us
[30:55] father how thankful we are lord we ask
[30:58] these things in the wonderful name of
[31:00] our lord jesus christ amen and amen you
[31:04] may be seated
[31:09] so for a title this morning
[31:12] is it okay if if
[31:14] we had the first round yesterday night
[31:18] so if is it okay
[31:20] brother wayne mentioned the whipping
[31:23] sorry brother wayne that's powerful
[31:26] i i rather use the word knockout
[31:29] so this is the second round so if it's
[31:31] okay with you but
[31:33] we're all together in this
[31:36] let's have a second knockout
[31:39] come on church
[31:43] let's have a second knock out
[31:46] because oh
[31:48] how thankful we can be
[31:50] amen that a mighty angel came down
[31:54] a mighty angel came down and revealed me
[31:57] who he was
[31:59] amen when the word was opened up when
[32:01] the seals were broken it was revealing
[32:04] christ who he was amen and i'm a part of
[32:07] christ so it's revealing who i am
[32:14] it's important
[32:15] we read the word it's important we
[32:18] listen to what god wants to say to us so
[32:20] we know who we are
[32:24] because we live in an age
[32:26] loudly see an age where where everything
[32:28] becomes lukewarm and it comes to such a
[32:31] point where even in the message well the
[32:33] days of miracles have passed you know we
[32:36] live in a time where well you know at
[32:38] the time of brother branham a lot of
[32:39] miracles happen and nowadays well when i
[32:42] pray i don't even know if lord will
[32:44] answer and and i've asked and and i
[32:46] prayed and and i don't know if god is
[32:48] is still working
[32:50] that is satan the spirit the antichrist
[32:53] spirit
[32:55] trying
[32:56] to work on your mind
[32:58] telling you that he is dead that god is
[33:01] dead but i'm here this morning to say
[33:04] that he is alive
[33:06] god has never lost his power are we
[33:09] going to see what god's plan is for us
[33:12] amen we heard it last night those that
[33:15] know their god
[33:17] they will do
[33:19] exploits
[33:20] [Music]
[33:24] come on
[33:27] so the moment you doubt
[33:29] the weapon says the prophet
[33:32] he's got you then so the moment you
[33:34] start so i'm gonna deal with all these
[33:37] these spirits where oh god doesn't save
[33:40] anymore god doesn't seal anymore god
[33:42] doesn't heal anymore god doesn't bring
[33:44] backsliders back
[33:46] that's nonsense
[33:48] that's nonsense god is still the same
[33:51] this morning
[33:56] so i'm gonna bring it from another
[33:57] corner
[33:58] amen and for a title i'd like to take i
[34:01] speak jesus
[34:06] hallelujah amen
[34:08] let me remind you we're fighting a
[34:09] defeated enemy
[34:12] is that all that
[34:15] that makes me want to shout
[34:17] we are fighting a defeated enemy now
[34:20] brother david i'm i'm going through
[34:22] hearts and some hardship so what he's
[34:24] still a defeated enemy
[34:29] so i'm going to read a few verses here
[34:31] colossians 2
[34:33] verse 9 for in him dwell at all the
[34:35] fullness of the godhead bodily and ye
[34:37] are complete in him
[34:39] which is the head of all principality
[34:42] and power
[34:44] now
[34:45] daniel 2 34
[34:47] thou saw still that a stone was cut out
[34:50] with our hands which smote the image
[34:52] upon his feet that were of iron and clay
[34:55] and break them to pieces matthew 21 42
[34:58] you don't need to
[34:59] just listen jesus said unto them did you
[35:02] never read in the scriptures the stone
[35:04] which the builders rejected the same has
[35:06] become the head of the corner this is
[35:08] the lord's doing and it is marvelous in
[35:11] our eyes
[35:14] matthew 21 44 and whosoever shall fall
[35:18] on this stone shall be broken but on
[35:20] whomsoever it shall fall it will ground
[35:23] him to powder
[35:26] 1 peter 2 6
[35:27] wherefore also it is contained in the
[35:29] scriptures behold i lay in zion achieve
[35:33] cornerstone elect precious and he that
[35:36] believeth on him shall not be confounded
[35:38] or shall not be put to shame or to a
[35:42] blush
[35:43] so there's no reason for us to be put
[35:46] out of blush or have shame no no i speak
[35:49] jesus he is still the same god
[35:58] now we see the image you can say well
[36:00] that's in the book of daniel it's a
[36:01] prophetic book
[36:03] brethren says
[36:06] i chose the book of daniel because it
[36:08] was a pre-shadow of the great day that
[36:10] we're living in now the gentile age and
[36:13] everything in the gentile age just
[36:15] how one kingdom will succeed to another
[36:18] until it come down to the very end days
[36:20] that we are living in now
[36:23] so we see amen it goes from gold the
[36:27] head of gold the breast of silver the
[36:29] ties of brass legs of iron the feet of
[36:32] iron and clay so it's it's a the gentile
[36:35] age
[36:36] but where are we at now amen
[36:39] i don't want to go in all the details
[36:41] because that's a sermon in itself amen
[36:43] but just where are we at now brother
[36:45] branham he speaks in conference
[36:47] he says
[36:48] chris and you've heard that before but
[36:51] just i'm just building up here
[36:52] khrushchev means in russia dirt or clay
[36:55] eisenhower means the head of this is
[36:58] iron iron and clay they couldn't mix
[37:00] together they won't cleave one to
[37:03] another the next thing left
[37:06] is the stone to be cut out
[37:08] the coming of the lord to roll into this
[37:11] image and mash it into pieces
[37:16] so what time are we living in
[37:20] the end of the end time
[37:25] that's what is left this stone to come
[37:28] and mash it to pieces let's continue
[37:33] that stone
[37:34] the christ jesus
[37:36] that stumbling stone to the word a stone
[37:39] of an offense a laughing stone a
[37:42] stumbling block to the church but
[37:45] precious stone
[37:48] now sisters
[37:51] you all love stones i know
[37:55] the bigger the diamond the bigger the
[37:57] sapphire the bigger the
[37:58] ruby
[37:59] the more you love it ah come on
[38:04] yes
[38:07] but we're talking here about a more
[38:09] precious stone
[38:12] which is christ jesus so nothing against
[38:15] liking a diamond and and oh i have
[38:17] nothing against that but i'm preaching
[38:19] about somebody who is more precious than
[38:22] gold more precious than anything than
[38:24] anything this world can offer
[38:28] it's a precious stone a load stone to
[38:31] the believer
[38:33] a stone of assurance a stone of rest
[38:38] now listen a lodestone i checked it up
[38:41] you know what the definition is of a
[38:42] lodestone
[38:44] a piece of magnetite or other naturally
[38:46] magnetized mineral able to be used as a
[38:50] magnet
[38:52] or
[38:54] other definition
[38:55] is
[38:56] a person or thing that is the focus of
[39:00] attention or attraction
[39:04] what's the attraction on mount baker
[39:06] camp
[39:10] there is an
[39:12] attraction and it's a reality
[39:16] it's not something makeup it's not just
[39:18] an emotion it is a reality it is a life
[39:26] may there come forth this great issue of
[39:29] this rock that is cut out of the
[39:31] mountain without hands so it doesn't
[39:34] need any help of any man
[39:38] god
[39:39] builds his own church
[39:43] man can build kingdoms
[39:45] i've been last week we were in france
[39:48] somewhere we visited a stronghold of the
[39:50] 11th century that sounds old and it is
[39:52] old well whatever was in his room was
[39:55] remaining
[39:57] so man can build tremendous beautiful
[40:00] things
[40:01] but they don't last
[40:03] but what god builds is eternal
[40:08] so don't build your hopes on sinking
[40:10] sand
[40:11] but build everything on the solid rock i
[40:14] stand
[40:18] hallelujah
[40:20] it'll crush these gentile kingdoms to
[40:22] the ground all these kingdoms spiritual
[40:25] kingdoms natural kingdoms and the rock
[40:27] will cover the whole earth it will be
[40:30] purified purified air those who the rock
[40:33] crush will be ground into powder and
[40:35] those who fall upon that rock shall have
[40:38] a solid foundation
[40:42] that's the foundation i want to be
[40:44] building on
[40:48] brother branham talking about this
[40:50] lodestone magnet
[40:53] he says i'm thinking about another great
[40:55] magnet hallelujah
[40:57] someday there'll be a sound like a
[40:59] rushing mighty wind and here he will
[41:02] come and all those that are magnetized
[41:05] to his spirit will go up to meet him in
[41:07] the air
[41:08] those that are shackled down with sin
[41:11] those that are aluminum
[41:17] aluminum church members
[41:22] so we don't want to be church members
[41:25] i'm a church girl well that's that
[41:27] doesn't help you a thing
[41:33] i want to count well so what
[41:36] if that's why you came i went to camp
[41:40] you will go out and you say i was at
[41:42] camp
[41:42] but if you come under such desperation i
[41:46] want to meet god
[41:47] i had struggle in my life i'm fighting
[41:50] with this giant with that giant but time
[41:53] has come
[41:54] i will take possession
[41:56] [Music]
[42:01] is it possible
[42:02] oh yes i'll prove it by the word
[42:07] those that are shackled down with sin
[42:09] those that are aluminum church members
[42:11] will never make it oh my what a day that
[42:14] will be
[42:15] keep my soul magnetized lord with your
[42:18] spirit above all things
[42:21] that should be our soul desire keep my
[42:23] soul magnetized to you lord
[42:29] the song that was cut
[42:31] is ready to come at any time he says and
[42:34] when it comes what does it do it does
[42:36] away with this gentile age
[42:38] amen it's all over and god completely
[42:41] quits dealing with them
[42:44] my
[42:46] god gives us this time
[42:49] amen to be ready
[42:52] but there will be a time that it's over
[42:54] with
[42:57] so we're not playing games here
[42:59] it's serious yes it is
[43:02] it's all over and god completely quits
[43:05] dealing with him what does he do then he
[43:07] takes his church the holy ghost filled
[43:11] and only those that are filled
[43:13] magnetized as the prophet said with the
[43:15] holy ghost will be raptured
[43:19] that's why he uses a prophet this
[43:21] example of a magnet
[43:24] a stumbling stone some make fun of it
[43:26] laugh about it but it's a load song to
[43:28] the believer it's a magnet there's
[43:31] virtue in it amen because he wants to
[43:34] attract his people to himself
[43:40] we've got to be magnetized to the
[43:42] headstone and the headstone is the holy
[43:45] ghost christ and every one of us that's
[43:47] got the magnetism of the holy spirit
[43:50] when that stone strikes the image the
[43:53] church will flee to it back into glory
[43:59] what is he doing
[44:01] he's painting us a picture
[44:03] and what is it a holy ghost filled
[44:05] church
[44:08] he foreordained before the beginning of
[44:10] the world to appear yonder in his glory
[44:14] and one of these great mornings oh some
[44:16] good morning
[44:18] when time will be over i fly away
[44:24] we've sung that and sung that and sung
[44:26] that but it's a reality
[44:29] amen and you
[44:31] i we
[44:33] are gonna live it
[44:35] [Music]
[44:40] some of these great mornings he will
[44:41] sweep down true from the heavens
[44:44] amen hallelujah like a great magnet and
[44:46] we'll pick up that little church that
[44:49] has been persecuted hang her yonder in
[44:51] the hall of fame and when she goes to
[44:53] the sky she's shouting

[55:28] down with an open book
[55:31] revealing all the secrets all the

[55:46] not talking i face the book
[55:51] what does he say about me

[56:34] i am more than an overcomer
[56:38] [Music]
[56:39] so who do you want to believe
[56:43] google equals satan
[56:47] think of it
[56:49] the
[56:50] if the people of israel if they would
[56:52] have gone to the pharaoh
[56:54] and says
[56:55] well you dow great one pharaoh i don't
[56:58] know how they they talk to the pharaoh
[57:00] but anyway
[57:01] trying to explain it to you
[57:03] what do you think
[57:05] about
[57:06] god sending a deliverer
[57:13] well that's satan that's google but it's
[57:15] satan because that's exactly how he he
[57:18] treats you
[57:20] he's playing with your mind
[57:23] well what you know what do you think
[57:25] about singing a deliverer and and
[57:28] impossible i have the greatest army i am
[57:30] the strongest on this whole world
[57:33] we'll come to a little later
[57:36] how god deals how god works
[57:41] god he is almighty
[57:44] so brother branham he says let us fit
[57:46] ourselves to meet that cornerstone
[57:49] that's why we are here

[57:59] sisters
[58:01] no matter how young or how old you can
[58:02] be this is serious
[58:05] because the bible says in revelation his
[58:07] wife has made herself ready so god made
[58:10] everything he gave everything to his
[58:12] bride to prepare herself to adorn
[58:15] herself
[58:19] so that spiritual union of christ and
[58:22] his church now
[58:23] when that flesh is becoming word
[58:31] don't fall asleep on me now
[58:33] i told you already that one has a jet
[58:35] lag it's me
[58:39] and the word is becoming flesh
[58:42] manifested vindicated just what the
[58:45] bible said would happen in this day
[58:49] we just all said it together what day
[58:52] this day
[58:54] amen and he says here amen exactly what
[58:56] the bible said would happen in this day
[58:59] and it's happening day by day
[59:03] meeting after meeting
[59:07] so this is the second round
[59:09] total knockout
[59:11] and when i say total knock knockout it's
[59:13] not because of the preacher
[59:16] total knockout for each and every one of
[59:18] you
[59:21] you start claiming your god-given
[59:23] privileges
[59:24] start naming it
[59:27] i speak jesus over my sickness i speak
[59:30] jesus over my family i speak jesus over
[59:34] my trouble
[59:36] come on church
[59:39] there is power in the name of jesus
[59:45] hallelujah
[59:47] glory glory
[59:49] we know the jews are in their homeland
[59:51] the gentile apostasy has already taken
[59:54] place
[59:55] brother branham says we have a president
[59:57] like we have
[59:59] that doesn't only apply to the us
[1:00:02] that applies to canada to france to
[1:00:04] everywhere we have the presidents that
[1:00:06] we have
[1:00:10] we have a nation that's broke up like
[1:00:13] we have atomic bombs are hanging in the
[1:00:16] hangars and we have a church that is
[1:00:18] lukewarm but we have a church of people
[1:00:21] that's pulled their selves together at
[1:00:23] mount baker camp
[1:00:29] hallelujah
[1:00:31] we have a ministry that patterns the
[1:00:33] ministry of jesus christ
[1:00:35] for to catch that stone when he comes
[1:00:40] he says what's left to happen it can
[1:00:42] happen any minute
[1:00:45] any minute
[1:00:49] we see that the disciples they received
[1:00:51] a promise
[1:00:53] jesus told him
[1:00:55] go wait in jerusalem
[1:00:58] until you are endued with power
[1:01:02] so they knew
[1:01:04] they needed something
[1:01:08] so here they go to the upper room
[1:01:11] and the bible says they were in one
[1:01:13] accord
[1:01:14] that didn't mean they had a meeting and
[1:01:16] let's sit together and you know brother
[1:01:18] wayne what did he mean when he said i
[1:01:20] will send you power and let's have a
[1:01:21] meeting and we'll discuss you know like
[1:01:23] the council the council of nicaea where
[1:01:26] let's let's talk about what the bible
[1:01:28] means what god means what the message
[1:01:30] means what the the message is so clear
[1:01:32] it's only people that try to take the
[1:01:35] message and make it of non-effect
[1:01:38] thinking they have deep revelations
[1:01:41] might as well drop these bonds
[1:01:45] they have one thing in common and that
[1:01:48] was we need that power
[1:01:54] what happened
[1:01:56] once they got the experience
[1:02:00] acts 4 7 says and when they had set them
[1:02:03] in the midst they
[1:02:04] asked you know the story about the lame
[1:02:07] man
[1:02:08] by what power
[1:02:10] or by what name have you done this
[1:02:14] a man lame
[1:02:16] year in year out sitting there
[1:02:19] and now rejoicing shouting dancing in
[1:02:22] the spirit
[1:02:25] acts 4 10 says
[1:02:27] be it known unto ye all
[1:02:30] and to all the people around the world
[1:02:33] it says of israel i'm saying of all the
[1:02:36] world
[1:02:37] that by the name of jesus christ whom he
[1:02:41] crucified whom god raised from the dead
[1:02:44] even by him that this man stand here
[1:02:47] before
[1:02:48] you whole
[1:02:53] and it ain't done verse 11 says this is
[1:02:56] the stone which was set at nod of you
[1:02:59] builders and which has become the head
[1:03:02] of the corner
[1:03:04] hallelujah
[1:03:07] the prophet says it may be later than we
[1:03:09] think
[1:03:10] so i
[1:03:12] i hope you realize that
[1:03:14] this is a state of emergency the
[1:03:16] president's loved or the the
[1:03:18] government's love to say it when covert
[1:03:19] was around state of emergency
[1:03:23] but here the prophet says it's maybe
[1:03:26] later than we think you see that's
[1:03:27] exactly scriptural the stone with our
[1:03:30] hands cut out of the mountain and so on
[1:03:31] of these days it's going to be that way
[1:03:34] when you're going to stream for
[1:03:35] something i said to them you've already
[1:03:38] had that time
[1:03:40] god has constantly warned you time after
[1:03:44] time i even said it to my own kids
[1:03:51] why do you
[1:03:52] quote that brother david so we realize
[1:03:57] that we need
[1:03:59] jesus christ in our lives
[1:04:06] he gave dominion over all things we know
[1:04:08] adam and eve and he gave he they had
[1:04:10] dominion over all things
[1:04:12] he has lost his godship he lost his
[1:04:15] sonship he lost his domain satan took it
[1:04:18] over but brother
[1:04:20] i love that end part brother
[1:04:25] we are waiting
[1:04:26] for the manifestations of the sons of
[1:04:29] god who will come back and take it over
[1:04:32] again
[1:04:36] now how many
[1:04:37] do we have at camp
[1:04:39] that can say amen
[1:04:41] i'm one of them
[1:04:44] don't do it don't do it for brother
[1:04:46] david don't do it for bread of tom don't
[1:04:47] do it for them don't
[1:04:49] you confess to god what you believe
[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:57] who will come back
[1:04:58] and take it over again
[1:05:02] waiting for the fullness of time when
[1:05:03] the pyramid gets up to the top when the
[1:05:06] full sons of god will me be manifested
[1:05:09] what time is this
[1:05:11] this day
[1:05:12] this time
[1:05:18] let's take an example in the bible moses
[1:05:20] coming back to egypt
[1:05:22] google
[1:05:27] moses has an encounter with a burning
[1:05:29] bush the burning bush had
[1:05:32] what moses lacked
[1:05:34] now
[1:05:36] here he receives word where
[1:05:38] you will go and you will deliver my
[1:05:40] people
[1:05:43] and we see
[1:05:44] in the bible it says i believe it's
[1:05:46] exodus 4
[1:05:47] where moses starts negotiating where he
[1:05:49] says i i'm i'm the least of of you know
[1:05:52] i i have no capacity no capability
[1:05:55] whatsoever i i i cannot even speak
[1:05:57] properly
[1:05:59] i have no power no might of myself i
[1:06:03] and god just reminds him
[1:06:05] who
[1:06:06] tell me moses
[1:06:09] who created your mouth
[1:06:16] it's not enough so moses continues i
[1:06:19] have nothing
[1:06:20] what do you have in your hand
[1:06:24] a rod
[1:06:26] well go and deliver my people
[1:06:30] now lord this is not really a weapon of
[1:06:33] mass destruction this is the most
[1:06:35] powerful army in the earth all over the
[1:06:38] world and i'm going with a stick
[1:06:42] now moses let me remind you
[1:06:45] if they ask you who sends
[1:06:47] you
[1:06:48] i am
[1:06:50] not i will be not i was
[1:06:53] i am that i am
[1:06:56] this morning he is still the i am
[1:07:00] amen for each and every one of you he is
[1:07:02] still the i am
[1:07:05] therefore i speak jesus
[1:07:13] he goes out
[1:07:17] now somebody crosses
[1:07:19] moses where are you going moses well
[1:07:22] going down to egypt to take over
[1:07:24] a one-man
[1:07:26] evasion we all love that story
[1:07:30] but now it's a one man a one woman
[1:07:34] battle
[1:07:36] against
[1:07:38] all these principalities
[1:07:40] the word has been spoken is being
[1:07:42] preached but it's our own battle brother
[1:07:44] wayne touch on it we have our giants in
[1:07:46] our lands in our land
[1:07:49] but we have to fight them
[1:07:54] going down a one-man invasion going down
[1:07:57] to
[1:07:58] take over egypt and he he links it it's
[1:08:00] like going to take over russia the best
[1:08:03] mechanized units in the world was right
[1:08:04] there but god told him i'm going to send
[1:08:07] you down to take over
[1:08:09] moses
[1:08:10] nah
[1:08:11] you're not serious
[1:08:13] brother david you're not serious have
[1:08:15] you lost your mind
[1:08:16] oh yeah
[1:08:18] i lost my mind i've got christ's mind
[1:08:23] amen that's what matters we have to be
[1:08:26] renewed
[1:08:27] in our mind
[1:08:29] amen when the word is being spoken we
[1:08:32] say i believe it lord
[1:08:34] because satan attacks here
[1:08:36] so moses if he would have walked by his
[1:08:38] mind by his intellect his intelligence
[1:08:42] he would have stayed home
[1:08:47] but who had the victory at the end
[1:08:51] now
[1:08:52] what that stick was in moses hand listen
[1:08:55] now church don't get quiet i mean
[1:08:58] what that stick represented
[1:09:00] this arm of mass
[1:09:04] destruction is the name of jesus christ
[1:09:08] to the born-again church
[1:09:11] i speak jesus
[1:09:14] do you hear me
[1:09:16] moses had a victory with a rod but now
[1:09:20] we have the name of jesus for our
[1:09:23] battles
[1:09:24] come on
[1:09:33] and of course we have carnal
[1:09:34] impersonators of the message
[1:09:37] that's what the prophet says
[1:09:40] just like moses had to face them
[1:09:43] here he comes let my people go
[1:09:46] i'm the deliverer god sends me i am
[1:09:48] sends me let my people go
[1:09:51] moses come on
[1:09:53] let's be serious
[1:09:55] throws down the rod
[1:09:58] oh we have some people that can do the
[1:10:00] same thing
[1:10:03] okay
[1:10:04] continue the quote
[1:10:06] carnal impersonators of the message try
[1:10:08] to mimic the same thing without knowing
[1:10:11] where it's coming from i love that
[1:10:16] notice
[1:10:18] the same shepherd staff
[1:10:20] that fell on the ground
[1:10:22] eat ate up the other snakes
[1:10:25] where was them snakes at they were rods
[1:10:29] on the floor
[1:10:30] and there was only one rod picked up
[1:10:33] both heavens and earth will pass away
[1:10:35] said jesus but my word shall never pass
[1:10:39] away
[1:10:41] god shows
[1:10:43] day and day in day out time and time
[1:10:46] again his supremacy
[1:10:51] you following
[1:10:56] when jesus came to jerusalem
[1:10:58] still building up
[1:11:00] it's got plenty of time
[1:11:03] he came into jerusalem and everybody was
[1:11:05] hosanna hosanna
[1:11:10] and there we can see already the same
[1:11:12] antichrist spirit working
[1:11:16] don't worship him
[1:11:18] that's where he says if
[1:11:20] they won't cry out those stones will cry
[1:11:24] if they hold their peace the rocks will
[1:11:26] immediately cry out what was it
[1:11:28] listen now the very rock that was hewed
[1:11:31] out of the mountain without hands was
[1:11:34] coming rolling into jerusalem
[1:11:39] come on now
[1:11:41] and us little rocks
[1:11:43] was drinking from it
[1:11:46] hallelujah
[1:11:49] how many are thirsty here this morning
[1:11:50] i'm not speaking naturally here
[1:11:55] because once you drink of this water
[1:11:58] that this rock gives you will never
[1:12:00] thirst again
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:03] amen so he was coming and amen these
[1:12:06] little rocks was drinking from it
[1:12:08] speak to the rock and it will bring
[1:12:11] forth its water
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:14] so now later on we can see
[1:12:17] israel they go through hardship they go
[1:12:20] through problems amen and brethren says
[1:12:23] amen the people in the testing time
[1:12:25] drops away like israel did
[1:12:28] i have a trial i'm
[1:12:31] i'll drop everything
[1:12:34] no don't drop everything listen to that
[1:12:36] quote
[1:12:38] the people in the testing time drops
[1:12:40] away like israel did they think that god
[1:12:42] has left them oh what a lie satan brings
[1:12:46] in your mind
[1:12:47] makes you think that
[1:12:49] god doesn't love you anymore that god
[1:12:51] doesn't forgive that god doesn't save
[1:12:53] that god doesn't feel that god doesn't
[1:12:55] deliver us that's what satan tries but
[1:12:58] remember the rock never left israel
[1:13:01] israel left the rock and it forgot about
[1:13:04] the rock being with them all the time
[1:13:08] it wasn't out of speaking distance
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:13] come on now
[1:13:15] it wasn't out of speaking distance
[1:13:20] it wasn't out of hearing distance it
[1:13:23] wasn't out of seeing distance and
[1:13:26] neither is christ with the church today
[1:13:29] he is not out of speaking distance
[1:13:34] so what are you going to say speak to
[1:13:37] the rock this morning
[1:13:39] i speak jesus
[1:13:42] over my trouble i speak jesus over my
[1:13:46] sickness i speak jesus over my situation
[1:13:51] start confessing it
[1:13:54] start believing it
[1:13:58] start thanking god for it
[1:14:05] the problem is
[1:14:08] we walk by reasoning too
[1:14:13] uh much david i spoke last last service
[1:14:16] you know i i
[1:14:18] i confessed the victory but
[1:14:23] let me continue to build up a little
[1:14:24] okay
[1:14:26] because god is not out of speaking
[1:14:28] distance
[1:14:30] he's not out of hearing distance
[1:14:32] he is still
[1:14:35] present help in a time of trouble
[1:14:39] he's a very present help if you're sick
[1:14:42] speak to the rock if you're sin sick
[1:14:44] speak to the rock if you're weary speak
[1:14:46] to the rock see the rock the driest
[1:14:49] place in the wilderness but he said
[1:14:52] speak to the rock
[1:14:57] and i believe
[1:14:59] sorry brother wayne
[1:15:00] i added in my notes so i'm going to
[1:15:02] quote it again
[1:15:03] i believe that there's a church on its
[1:15:06] road this morning
[1:15:08] a power of the living god
[1:15:10] where man will speak the word here and
[1:15:12] there and it will flash like lightning
[1:15:16] come on saints
[1:15:18] [Applause]
[1:15:20] satan can't bluff me anymore
[1:15:23] am i the only one or are we just the
[1:15:24] only ones
[1:15:27] bluffing i'm not made of that stuff says
[1:15:29] brother i'm not that bluffs
[1:15:33] i'm made of that stuff that he creates
[1:15:36] i'm his workmanship
[1:15:43] it'll flash like lightning amen amen
[1:15:46] amen oh if the church could ever get to
[1:15:49] that place to where it solemnly rests
[1:15:52] upon god's eternal word to be the truth
[1:15:56] what a difference there would be
[1:15:59] are you hearing me
[1:16:00] what a correcting there would be what a
[1:16:03] cutting away where there it would be
[1:16:06] that's why
[1:16:07] it's coming
[1:16:09] to a minority
[1:16:12] we see people dropping left right
[1:16:14] thousand may drop my left ten thousand
[1:16:17] my right
[1:16:18] but i'm going all the way
[1:16:21] i'm going all the way
[1:16:23] i started on this journey many years ago
[1:16:26] amen by god's grace he will bring me all
[1:16:28] the way
[1:16:32] hallelujah amen now he continuously says
[1:16:36] what a joy there would be what a power
[1:16:39] there would be when men and women would
[1:16:41] take god at face value
[1:16:48] what he said is the truth no matter what
[1:16:50] the circumstances look like that has
[1:16:52] nothing to do with it
[1:16:55] god said so that settles it
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:00] enough with this nonsense the time of
[1:17:03] miracles are gone
[1:17:06] enough with it
[1:17:11] he is still god
[1:17:13] therefore i speak jesus
[1:17:16] and annie no matter what the
[1:17:18] circumstance may look like amen in this
[1:17:21] camp i speak jesus amen there is no
[1:17:24] other name is a name above all names
[1:17:30] what should be our attitude
[1:17:32] amen oh the countdown is on
[1:17:40] and he said he starts counting 10 9 8
[1:17:44] they won't be crying but there will be
[1:17:46] singing and shouting and praising god
[1:17:51] i think the brothers reminded you last
[1:17:53] night there's nothing against true
[1:17:55] worship
[1:17:57] i'm not talking about emotion
[1:17:59] i'm talking about true worship
[1:18:03] when the people of god got delivered out
[1:18:06] of years and years of bondage
[1:18:10] they didn't go out there you know oh
[1:18:12] well you know
[1:18:15] poor me
[1:18:17] they were rejoicing
[1:18:19] they were shouting
[1:18:22] so what about us
[1:18:24] what about us when we see god's plan for
[1:18:27] us in our lives
[1:18:29] noah let's take another example
[1:18:32] he received the promise of god he was
[1:18:34] building an ark amen he was not only
[1:18:36] working a miracle but he was preparing
[1:18:39] for a miracle did we come to camp
[1:18:41] preparing for a miracle
[1:18:44] now maybe if you didn't come i'm i'm
[1:18:47] i'm just preaching the word of god
[1:18:50] but saying encouraging you
[1:18:54] come to church
[1:18:56] prepared for the miraculous
[1:18:59] the phenomenal to take place
[1:19:03] because god is still god this morning
[1:19:07] and still tonight until i'm leaving
[1:19:10] we're leaving this place
[1:19:12] so noah he was getting ready for a
[1:19:14] miracle
[1:19:15] and the church today is not only having
[1:19:17] miracles but it's preparing for a
[1:19:20] miracle the coming of the lord jesus and
[1:19:22] the rapture of the church
[1:19:24] and he says he says give me a church
[1:19:27] come on now
[1:19:28] ready
[1:19:29] visualize to see signs and to see the
[1:19:34] omnipotent god the great power of god
[1:19:37] moving amongst the people
[1:19:42] oh the rapture will be an easy thing
[1:19:47] explain me how will it don't worry about
[1:19:49] explanation
[1:19:51] the prophet tells me it's an easy thing
[1:19:55] i was
[1:19:56] i am no more
[1:19:59] we might get into that later today
[1:20:01] oh my
[1:20:03] it'll be a regular routine listen of
[1:20:06] following the scriptures and the plans
[1:20:09] of god
[1:20:10] the word of god can never fail
[1:20:15] remember christ and the true church is a
[1:20:18] continuation of a book of acts
[1:20:21] through who
[1:20:23] through us
[1:20:25] he is the power
[1:20:28] but now the magnet the magnetism goes
[1:20:31] from the head
[1:20:32] through us from the messiah to them
[1:20:34] through the messiahs
[1:20:36] come on now
[1:20:39] glory
[1:20:41] christ in the true church is a
[1:20:42] continuation of the book of acts and he
[1:20:45] knows that's why satan hates this
[1:20:47] revelation
[1:20:48] like brother wayne reminded us the
[1:20:50] people who know
[1:20:52] who have a revelation
[1:20:54] of who god is who they are
[1:20:57] that's why brother abraham says when the
[1:20:59] bride will know her position the rapture
[1:21:02] will take place
[1:21:03] so there's something about knowing who
[1:21:05] you are and god gave he came down and
[1:21:08] gave us an open book so we can see
[1:21:11] what is written about us
[1:21:12] not what we think about us not what
[1:21:15] anybody can say about me
[1:21:21] he knows that if the people get the true
[1:21:23] revelation of the true church and what
[1:21:25] she stands for what she stands for and
[1:21:27] what she can do
[1:21:30] are you hearing me what she can do
[1:21:35] the greater works she
[1:21:37] will be an invincible army
[1:21:40] and satan will be powerless before her

[1:22:58] only one way to know his will and that
[1:23:00] is that is by the word of god
[1:23:02] lamentations 3 37 says who is he that
[1:23:06] sayeth and it cometh to pass when the
[1:23:09] lord commanded it not there it is if it
[1:23:12] isn't the word you can have it so we can
[1:23:14] ask we can't ask unless it's in the word
[1:23:19] and we can't petition or ask unless it
[1:23:23] is in his name

[1:44:19] this or my dad i'm not listening to that
[1:44:22] i'm listening to what the word of god
[1:44:24] tells me
[1:44:26] we are proof of his victory
[1:44:30] amen amen he himself is working through
[1:44:33] us manifesting himself he is the same
[1:44:36] yesterday today

[1:44:41] john 14
[1:44:42] 12
[1:44:43] verily verily i say unto
[1:44:46] you he that believeth on me
[1:44:50] the works that i do shall he do also
[1:44:53] and greater works than these shall he do
[1:44:56] because i go unto my father and
[1:44:58] whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[1:45:03] that i will do

[1:45:30] anything
[1:45:34] anything
[1:45:35] in my name

[1:45:40] philippians 2 verse 9 says wherefore god
[1:45:42] also had highly exalted him and given
[1:45:45] him a name which is above every name
[1:45:50] that at the name of jesus
[1:45:53] every knee shall battle
[1:45:55] the things in heaven the things in earth
[1:45:58] the things under the earth and that
[1:46:00] every tongue should confess that jesus
[1:46:02] christ is lord to the glory of god the
[1:46:05] father
[1:46:08] i speak jesus
[1:46:18] few more moments
[1:46:19] almost done
[1:46:25] there's something about the name of
[1:46:26] jesus
[1:46:32] when mary
[1:46:34] when she received the word
[1:46:36] luke 1 38 says and mary said
[1:46:40] behold
[1:46:45] excuse me behold
[1:46:48] the handmaid of the lord
[1:46:51] now excuse my english
[1:46:55] but i'm taking it like this behold
[1:46:58] i am handmade
[1:47:00] by the lord
[1:47:04] i am his workmanship
[1:47:08] his bride is his workmanship
[1:47:11] i am handmade by the lord
[1:47:15] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:47:20] and the angel departed when mary goes to
[1:47:22] her friend elizabeth to tell her what
[1:47:25] happened
[1:47:26] listen
[1:47:28] as soon as she said jesus
[1:47:33] maybe the musicians can come
[1:47:35] as soon as she said jesus
[1:47:38] the power of the holy ghost fell
[1:47:42] hallelujah
[1:47:44] the moment she pronounced jesus
[1:47:47] the power of the holy ghost fell and the
[1:47:50] little dead baby in the mother's womb
[1:47:52] began to leap for joy
[1:47:54] [Music]
[1:47:56] you want to tell me i can't leave for
[1:47:58] joy
[1:47:59] i can't rejoice
[1:48:02] when i speak jesus
[1:48:08] if the name of jesus first spoke by a
[1:48:10] human lips will bring life to a dead
[1:48:14] baby
[1:48:15] what it ought to do to christians who
[1:48:18] are born again
[1:48:21] young people
[1:48:24] are you hearing me this morning
[1:48:27] when you pronounce the name of jesus
[1:48:33] something is happening
[1:48:36] why don't we stand
[1:48:38] rod brown says in perseverance
[1:48:42] and just as soon as the human name of
[1:48:44] god
[1:48:45] jesus
[1:48:46] oh i love how he says
[1:48:48] amen
[1:48:48] the human name of god jesus was spoke by
[1:48:51] mortal lip out of human being
[1:48:55] now i'm making it personal
[1:48:57] how many human beings do we have here
[1:49:00] how am i we still have mortal lips
[1:49:03] but that's what he shows us here as an
[1:49:05] example
[1:49:07] amen was spoke by mortal lips out of
[1:49:09] human being a dead baby came to life in
[1:49:12] the womb of a woman and receive the holy
[1:49:15] ghost
[1:49:16] what will it do to the born-again church
[1:49:19] of god
[1:49:23] there is power in the name of jesus
[1:49:27] when i was getting ready for camp
[1:49:29] why brother
[1:49:31] david do you take
[1:49:36] this this message
[1:49:39] because the lord told me
[1:49:41] a few weeks down
[1:49:44] for you pray about it seeking the will
[1:49:46] of the lord
[1:49:47] lord what do we need what do you want to
[1:49:49] tell your people
[1:49:52] and i i had to travel
[1:49:54] and you know i remember brother wayne
[1:49:56] was telling the giving the testimony one
[1:49:58] time he was sitting in a plane and
[1:50:00] i think he was listening to a message
[1:50:02] and
[1:50:03] and all of a sudden the spirit came down
[1:50:05] i am barabbas
[1:50:08] so god works in mysterious ways
[1:50:10] sometimes
[1:50:12] but we have to be sensitive enough to
[1:50:14] hear his voice we sang it before i love
[1:50:17] his voice
[1:50:20] do we really love his voice
[1:50:22] are we sensitive enough to hear his
[1:50:24] voice this morning
[1:50:25] so that we apply it that we live by the
[1:50:28] word of god so i was sitting
[1:50:30] i was traveling and i was sitting in the
[1:50:32] lounge
[1:50:33] i was praying i was too early i thought
[1:50:36] you know the the security was going to
[1:50:38] take long and anyway i was sitting there
[1:50:40] and
[1:50:42] listening to some music
[1:50:45] said lord
[1:50:47] what do you want me to preach
[1:50:51] and here comes the song i speak jesus
[1:50:58] and believe me saints such an anointing
[1:51:01] came down
[1:51:04] i was weeping i was worshiping
[1:51:08] i was paralyzed on my chair i didn't
[1:51:10] care who was sitting on my left or my
[1:51:12] right maybe they called me crazy
[1:51:14] but i don't care
[1:51:16] he was there
[1:51:20] i knew god wanted to tell us
[1:51:23] there is power in the name of jesus
[1:51:28] the name above all names
[1:51:30] but if you can put it on your lips
[1:51:33] believe
[1:51:34] and speak the word it's deity speaking
[1:51:36] through your lips
[1:51:45] you know in possibilities they melt
[1:51:50] like a snowball
[1:51:51] on a red hot stove says the prophet
[1:51:54] when fate steps in
[1:51:58] maybe if
[1:52:00] sister
[1:52:01] ava
[1:52:03] charity and the group if you if you can
[1:52:04] come forward we're at camp we will do
[1:52:06] things a little different but
[1:52:11] i'm winding up here so
[1:52:13] stay stay focused on the word
[1:52:18] mark 16
[1:52:21] tells us
[1:52:23] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:52:27] believe
[1:52:28] in my name
[1:52:30] whose name in my name
[1:52:33] it's not because they're coming forward
[1:52:35] we keep on preaching we keep on saying
[1:52:37] amen to the word
[1:52:38] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:52:41] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:52:43] shall take they shall take up serpents
[1:52:46] and they dre and if they drink any
[1:52:48] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[1:52:50] shall lay hands upon the sick and they
[1:52:52] shall recover
[1:52:54] in my name
[1:52:57] speak jesus
[1:53:04] in the name of jesus we have the victory
[1:53:05] let me wind up with a few quotes
[1:53:11] in jesus name
[1:53:13] we have
[1:53:15] listen
[1:53:17] that came in the middle of the night
[1:53:20] in jesus name
[1:53:22] we have
[1:53:24] you name it
[1:53:27] you name it
[1:53:29] we have you name it
[1:53:32] every
[1:53:33] redemptive blessing
[1:53:36] that he gave me
[1:53:41] so
[1:53:42] brothers and sisters
[1:53:44] you start naming it
[1:53:46] in jesus name
[1:53:50] and don't tell me
[1:53:54] tell you goliath
[1:53:59] how little how much of a bluff he is
[1:54:02] in jesus name
[1:54:04] you know a little example and then i'll
[1:54:06] wind up with one more quote
[1:54:09] david was a little boy
[1:54:12] david in the bible was a little boy
[1:54:16] but he had to meet his goliath
[1:54:20] so it doesn't matter how tall how big
[1:54:23] how strong david was little
[1:54:25] but he served a big god
[1:54:29] and here he comes
[1:54:32] here were some stones that were
[1:54:34] predestinated for before the foundation
[1:54:36] of the world that god shaped perfectly
[1:54:39] hmm
[1:54:41] i love predestination
[1:54:44] god was
[1:54:46] through the ages preparing
[1:54:50] this atomic
[1:54:51] power because a goliath was coming
[1:54:54] before david
[1:54:56] brett abraham says he took up five
[1:54:57] stones which is grace
[1:55:00] f-a-i-t-h
[1:55:02] in
[1:55:03] g-e-s-u-s
[1:55:06] and he starred it
[1:55:10] goliath might hit his boasts
[1:55:12] and david says here you come with all
[1:55:15] your armor
[1:55:16] a big spear big sword
[1:55:19] here you come in this final age with all
[1:55:22] these gadgets with all these this
[1:55:24] divertism and all these things
[1:55:30] but boost satan
[1:55:32] i'm coming
[1:55:34] i hope i have some irons here you know
[1:55:36] that can say i'm coming
[1:55:40] to face you goliath
[1:55:42] in the name of jesus
[1:55:46] i don't need a big
[1:55:47] armor
[1:55:49] they tried it on him
[1:55:50] no i cannot trust that
[1:55:54] but there's one thing i'm coming with
[1:55:57] that's with the name of jesus
[1:56:00] and he prophesied
[1:56:01] and let us prophesy again church he
[1:56:04] prophesied he said
[1:56:06] and this day
[1:56:08] i'm gonna cut your head so why don't you
[1:56:11] confess it this morning this day i'm
[1:56:14] gonna cut your head and i'm gonna feed
[1:56:17] you to the fowls of the air
[1:56:21] i speak jesus
[1:56:26] final quotes i don't know if you want to
[1:56:28] start playing brother ryan
[1:56:33] anything that satan has put upon you in
[1:56:36] the way of sickness
[1:56:38] or whatever it is
[1:56:41] every born-again person
[1:56:44] has an abstract warrant
[1:56:49] has a warrant from god
[1:56:51] and the holy spirit is here to put any
[1:56:54] devil out no matter if it's cancer tumor
[1:56:59] cataract whatever it is the holy spirit
[1:57:02] will put him out if you serve notice
[1:57:11] are you hearing me church yes
[1:57:13] not if brother david serves notice not
[1:57:16] have brother tom brother wayne or
[1:57:18] if you serve notice
[1:57:21] each and every one of you
[1:57:24] maybe you failed yesterday maybe you've
[1:57:26] been through a hard time but here you
[1:57:28] are
[1:57:29] god ordained these meanings for you to
[1:57:32] hear the word of god
[1:57:34] so you can speak the name of jesus
[1:57:41] if you serve notice on him in the name
[1:57:43] of jesus christ
[1:57:45] because he has no legal rights
[1:57:51] i am the lord that healeth all thy
[1:57:53] diseases
[1:57:54] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:57:57] and with his stripes we are healed
[1:58:00] but you've got to go over and take it
[1:58:04] now israel
[1:58:05] they started out
[1:58:07] and god said
[1:58:08] this is your land
[1:58:12] god told us this is your land
[1:58:15] go possess it
[1:58:20] i give it to you right now
[1:58:22] not i give it to you in in a few weeks
[1:58:25] in it
[1:58:25] right now
[1:58:28] and i'm going to give you a witness
[1:58:31] to go before you
[1:58:34] here's going to be a pillar of fire
[1:58:37] and it's going to follow you
[1:58:39] and it'll lead you just exactly where
[1:58:42] you should go
[1:58:46] that's my lord and savior
[1:58:49] he will guide me in all truth
[1:58:51] he will lead me until the end
[1:58:53] he will bring me at my final destination
[1:58:56] what is my final destination my
[1:59:00] place of origin
[1:59:04] i came from god
[1:59:06] and i'm going back to god
[1:59:09] and now here i can rejoice because
