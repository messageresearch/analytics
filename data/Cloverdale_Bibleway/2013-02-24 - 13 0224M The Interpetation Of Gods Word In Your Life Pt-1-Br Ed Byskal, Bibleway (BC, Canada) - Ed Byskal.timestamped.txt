[19:01] the Lord for healing her after eight
[19:02] weeks of suffering and pain. The
[19:04] infection is gone. What antibiotics

[19:11] goes to him. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless
[19:14] you, Sister Eileen.
[19:17] Amen. We don't have any written prayer
[19:18] requests, but we do want to remember the
[19:21] Vineyard family that God would be a
[19:23] comfort to them during this time. And
[19:25] anything else that's on your heart. And
[19:26] can we sing greater than all just as we
[19:28] prepare to go to prayer? Greater than
[19:30] all my sin.

[23:37] today, Father. We are ordained to hear
[23:39] the word that you have to bring forward
[23:41] to us, Father. But Lord God, our prayer
[23:44] is that we just not be hearers, Lord

[24:23] to do, what they have to say, Lord God,
[24:25] when the word goes forth, Father, may it
[24:28] change lives, Father. May souls be
[24:30] saved, Father. Lord, we know nothing is
[24:33] done in vain, Father. Lord, we're
[24:35] casting the bread upon the water, Lord.

[24:51] him now as he prepares himself to come

[24:57] anoint him, Father. Lord, speak through
[24:59] him, Lord. Father, we know that he has a

[25:21] many many out here in in the
[25:23] congregation in the audience that can
[25:25] attest and testify of the same thing,
[25:27] Lord God. Father, you are the one.
[25:30] You're the one that pours in the balm of
[25:32] Gilead. Lord God, only you know what
[25:35] each one of us has need of, Father.
[25:37] Lord, we think we know what the wants of
[25:39] our lives are, but Lord God, you know
[25:41] what the needs are. And father God,

[26:21] desires baptism and would uh like to
[26:23] speak to myself after the service or
[26:25] before the evening service, uh we
[26:28] believe we're at the end time. It's
[26:29] about time to go home. So, there's no
[26:31] reason to delay. There's nothing to wait
[26:34] for. God's given a promise and we want
[26:37] all that he has for us. So, we'll look
[26:39] forward to that this evening for the
[26:41] evening service. Uh, we've been just a
[26:44] couple announcements. Um, we've been
[26:47] looking forward to the prayer meetings
[26:48] and there's uh been some announcements
[26:50] about it being one on the US side. So,
[26:53] this Friday night we're having a prayer
[26:55] meeting on the US side at 7:30 and the
[26:59] Lord willing, it'll be at our home.
[27:01] We're just on 8th Street in Blaine,
[27:03] right across the border. And so it'll be
[27:06] on the back uh notice board, the address
[27:09] and um the time 7:30. And if anyone
[27:11] needs directions or uh you can get those
[27:14] by Friday night. Amen. We want to
[27:16] support what the Lord's doing and give
[27:18] you an opportunity on this side or that
[27:20] side of the border to be able to enter
[27:22] into prayer. Amen. It's so nice to see
[27:25] brother Michael Vineyard here this
[27:27] morning. and uh Sister Cindy Vineyard uh
[27:31] graduated into her new body on Thursday
[27:34] evening uh about 10:45.
[27:37] The body that had been wrapped by a lot
[27:40] of pain and suffering and gone through
[27:41] some years of of uh really kind of
[27:44] torture. She went into a new body that
[27:48] was leaping and jumping and and shouting
[27:51] on the heels of glory. And so we want to
[27:54] thank God for her life and for brother
[27:56] Michael and his family and for their uh
[27:59] strong testimony. Brother Michael, you
[28:01] mean a lot to us and we want to welcome
[28:03] you to the house of the Lord for a long
[28:05] long time. Brother Michael hasn't been
[28:07] able to travel. He's been such a
[28:09] caretaker for his wife. And so now is
[28:12] going to be a time for us in as an
[28:14] assembly and your the friends of brother
[28:15] Michael really to pour back into his
[28:18] life and to be with him. And it opens up
[28:20] a lot of uh areas of ministry for
[28:23] especially you brothers and families
[28:25] that knew the vineyard family just to
[28:27] call him up, spend some time. I know he
[28:29] likes fishing and he loves the the water
[28:32] and he loves to be in nature. So
[28:34] fellowship is always good. So this
[28:36] Friday or sorry this Tuesday, excuse me,
[28:40] at the camp we're going to be having a
[28:42] memorial service uh for Sister Cindy at
[28:45] 11:00 in the morning. Uh this Tuesday
[28:47] morning at 11 o'clock. I know a lot work
[28:50] and school, but uh if those that can and
[28:53] are able to come and support the
[28:54] vineyard family, I know it will do them
[28:57] a lot of good and encouragement. So,
[28:59] it'll be this Tuesday at 11:00 at the
[29:02] camp. And Sister Debbie Paris has asked
[29:05] that we contact her at the camp for
[29:08] refreshments. Uh we'd like to just if
[29:11] the sisters and different ones could
[29:12] maybe prepare some lunch items,
[29:15] sandwiches, uh bring some refreshments.
[29:18] uh we'll just gather together after the
[29:20] service uh around 12 up in the annex and
[29:22] have a little time with the family. Uh
[29:25] some of them can't cross the border so
[29:27] that's why we had it on the US side. So,
[29:29] that'll just give us some time on
[29:31] Tuesday to be with brother Vineyard and
[29:32] the family. And we're looking forward to
[29:34] that. And we're looking forward to
[29:36] today. And maybe the brothers can come.
[29:39] Um, we'll have uh the morning offering.
[29:42] Uh the deacons could come and we'll just
[29:43] prepare ourselves for that. And uh
[29:46] there's something special the Lord has
[29:48] for us today. I just believe the Lord
[29:52] has moved all of our hearts to such a
[29:54] time as this. And we're under
[29:55] anticipation. So, as the brothers come,
[29:58] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[30:00] prayer.
[30:03] Heavenly Father, we're just so mindful
[30:05] of your nearness, of your presence, and
[30:08] what you've mean to all of us over the
[30:09] years. We want to thank you for your
[30:11] comforting spirit, Lord, and for your

[30:16] for salvation, for the vineyard family,
[30:19] brother Mike that's here this morning.
[30:21] just an undying faith, just a resilience
[30:24] to continue to serve you in the good
[30:27] times or in the bad times. We comfort
[30:29] him today, Lord, and express our love to
[30:32] them as they've been a blessing to us.
[30:35] And now today, Lord, as we've gathered
[30:37] to give our tithes and our offerings, we
[30:39] want to give back, Lord, what you've
[30:41] given to us. And we just pray that you'd
[30:43] multiply it as the ministry has gone
[30:45] around the world and even locally that
[30:48] you would just continue to provide all
[30:50] of our needs and provide for the needs
[30:53] of of the the bride around this globe.
[30:56] Lord, we're looking for your coming and
[30:58] we're so happy for what you're doing
[31:00] among us and the stir of God. And we
[31:02] just pray that it would continue even
[31:04] today, Lord, that you would move greatly
[31:06] within our lives. We love you, Jesus. We
[31:09] just dedicate this offering to you in
[31:12] the name of Jesus Christ.
[31:14] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[31:22] Amen. We just want to continue to
[31:23] prepare our hearts for the receiving of
[31:25] the word this morning. Always sing
[31:27] blessed be. Blessed be your name.

[32:03] mighty tower.
[32:06] You, oh Lord,
[32:09] are a strong and mighty tower.
[32:12] You're an ever present help
[32:17] in my darkest hour.
[32:20] You're my hiding place
[32:24] for the ancient of days. You are the
[32:28] rock.
[32:31] Lord, you are worthy of my praise.
[32:36] Blessed

[33:13] for. You're the everflowing
[33:17] fountain
[33:18] that my heart always thirst for. You're
[33:23] the one who makes me whole.

[36:08] We are standing.
[36:13] [Music]
[36:14] You believe it this morning. On holy
[36:18] ground.
[36:22] And I know that there are angels,
[36:24] hallelujah, walking up and down each
[36:26] aisle.
[36:28] Blessed be the Lord
[36:30] all
[36:32] around.
[36:34] So let us pray.
[36:39] Oh, we praise you Lord.
[36:43] Oh Jesus
[36:46] now
[36:50] for we are standing.
[36:53] Oh with his presence on holy ground. How
[37:00] it once more as we turn the service to
[37:02] our pastor. Oh, and we are standing.
[37:11] Oh, on holding
[37:14] ground
[37:18] when
[37:20] I go that there
[37:24] are angels
[37:26] all around.
[37:29] Oh, let us pray.
[37:34] Oh,
[37:36] let us pray.
[37:39] Jesus,
[37:52] holy
[37:54] ground.
[37:58] Hallelujah.
[38:01] Good to be in the house of God this
[38:03] morning.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; And good to be here with some
[38:06] expectation.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to thank you for your
[38:10] prayers. We've had a good rest, Sister
[38:12] Biscll and I. And now uh we're back in
[38:15] the saddle again. Uh I'm going to
[38:20] uh in just a few moments have you stand
[38:23] with me and we're going to read some
[38:26] scripture. But I do want to say that uh
[38:29] we were I was happy to get back one day
[38:32] early. We had to get back one day early
[38:35] and that's the way the flights were
[38:36] arranged. And we just got back and and
[38:40] heard of our sister Cindy's passing. And
[38:43] um we're certainly
[38:45] uh thankful that we can be part of that.
[38:49] That's a homegoing.
[38:51] It is, as brother John said, a
[38:53] graduation.
[38:54] So all that can be with us on Tuesday
[38:57] morning out at the Bible Bible way camp,
[39:00] we want to be there together with the
[39:03] vineyard family. There is uh besides
[39:06] brother Michael, then there's the eldest
[39:08] son Daniel, his wife Sarah, and then Bob
[39:13] and Novani, who many of us know, and
[39:16] they will be there, of course. Then
[39:18] there are uh there are grandchildren
[39:23] and one great grandchild and she got to
[39:26] see that great grandchild before
[39:29] passing.
[39:30] Hallelujah.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:35] And we are thankful for brother
[39:39] Mike and Sister Cindy's testimony. And
[39:41] I'll probably might say a little bit
[39:43] more a little later on, brother Michael,
[39:46] about that.
[39:49] Uh, isn't God good?
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Nice to see you, brother Sam Walder and
[39:55] Sister Randy. The devil tried to attack
[39:58] Sister Randy yesterday morning. I'm glad
[40:01] you're here, Sister Randy, to say to the
[40:04] devil and say to all the people, "God's
[40:06] the same."
[40:08] &gt;&gt; And the devil is indeed defeated.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Now, we have a lot of different names
[40:13] for these things. And uh and and there's
[40:16] a lot of things that people face today
[40:19] that uh actually
[40:22] uh the doctors don't have a remedy for.
[40:26] There's a precious very precious
[40:28] brother, pastor Dystra.
[40:31] He has been in hospital in uh Germany.
[40:35] His son-in-law is pastor in uh Crayfeld,
[40:39] just out of Crayfeld in Dwisburg.
[40:42] and uh brother Pankinan, his wonderful,
[40:44] wonderful brother. Uh and uh brother Tim
[40:49] Dodd was just there speaking the
[40:51] convention and brother Dystra was he's
[40:54] one of the main pastors or I'd say kind
[40:56] of the main pillar pastor there in in
[40:59] Holland and here the doctors have not
[41:02] been able to find out what's wrong.
[41:06] Week and week and weeks and weeks and
[41:07] weeks and can't find out what's wrong.
[41:10] Well, brother Brandham says he just says
[41:11] it simply. You know, you call it cancer,
[41:13] but he said it's the devil
[41:16] and we don't need a lot of names.
[41:19] We don't need a lot of names. We know
[41:21] that it is the devil. And why I
[41:24] certainly don't have anything against
[41:25] doctors. I thank God for them. The
[41:28] prophet thanked God for them. Some of
[41:30] his great friends were were uh Dr.
[41:33] Samadair.
[41:35] And uh and we're thankful for what they
[41:37] can do. and they can perhaps tell you
[41:39] something about your body that you don't
[41:40] know. And I know I've gone to a doctor
[41:43] and I said, he said, "What are you
[41:45] doing?" And so I I told him what I was
[41:47] doing. He said, "No, you're doing
[41:48] exactly the wrong thing." So that's when
[41:51] I thank God for a doctor. Okay, what
[41:53] should I do? We know you said do this.
[41:54] Okay, fine. And then go home and do what
[41:57] he said do and then you're okay. You
[41:59] know, and uh so we're thankful for that.
[42:02] But we want to remember our brother Dyra
[42:05] that God will strengthen him. It's been
[42:07] a miracle that he's been preserved to
[42:09] this time. Also just got a text from
[42:11] brother Tom just before coming to
[42:13] service and he just had the last
[42:15] service. He and brother Murphy they've
[42:18] had uh a very intense number of meetings
[42:23] and also ministers meetings and now uh
[42:28] they are there right now. Michael is
[42:30] over there and has just arrived. They're
[42:32] meeting in Sanhen uh now this evening
[42:36] and they're going to commence uh doing a
[42:39] lot of video work and so on and being
[42:41] with the the saints and believers in
[42:43] Sanhan that are moving forward with the
[42:46] Bible project for China. I am enthused
[42:51] about the Bible project. I may not get
[42:54] enthused very quickly, but once I do,
[42:57] I'm like a bulldog, you know. I'm very
[43:00] enthused to think that we can have a
[43:03] primary part in giving the people of
[43:06] China an accurate Bible,
[43:09] &gt;&gt; a Bible that the prophet of God used. I
[43:11] think that's wonderful. Amen. Well, I'm
[43:14] not going to take any uh delay, but I'd
[43:16] like to sing that song one more time.
[43:18] Sister Lena, here um we're standing on
[43:22] holy ground. Let's all stand, shall we?
[43:26] When we are standing
[43:32] on holy
[43:35] ground,
[43:39] when I go and there are angels
[43:46] all around,
[43:51] oh let us Praise
[43:58] our Jesus
[44:00] now.
[44:04] For we are standing
[44:08] in his presence, our holy
[44:13] ground.
[44:15] Let's sing together also the chorus of
[44:17] that old hymn. He leadeth me. He leadeth
[44:20] me. By his own hand he leadeth me. All
[44:23] right, let's sing it together. And let's
[44:25] sing it with uh uh with some conviction
[44:29] in our heart. Hallelujah.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; You know, when people just win a ball
[44:35] game or brother Ben a hockey game, I'm
[44:38] sure that there's a little more. Well,
[44:39] well, that was nice. No, no, we just are
[44:42] enthused about it. I'm enthused that God
[44:45] leads us.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Do you believe he knows you?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Has he led you?
[44:50] &gt;&gt; He does indeed. All right, let us sing
[44:52] it once again. He leadth me.
[44:56] Oh, he leth
[44:59] me. He leadth me. By his own
[45:08] me.
[45:10] Oh, his faithful
[45:13] power
[45:15] I would be. For by his hand he
[45:22] good.
[45:25] He me
[45:29] help me my
[45:33] high
[45:36] [Music]
[45:38] and his faithful
[45:41] father
[45:43] I would be for I
[45:52] heavenly Father,
[45:54] you are our guide.
[45:57] You have led us. And your ways are not
[46:00] our ways. They're so far beyond our
[46:03] ways. None of us thought that you would
[46:06] send a messenger such as you have in
[46:09] this day. None of us even dreamed or
[46:12] imagined there would be such a message
[46:14] as you have sent us in this hour. That
[46:17] it would be a call to the rapture. the
[46:22] change of these bodies. And Lord Jesus,
[46:25] as we see one departing us here and our
[46:28] sister Cindy having departed us and
[46:31] others have departed us in the past, we
[46:34] know that it's just beyond the curtain
[46:36] of time. And we have these phrases
[46:39] because your messenger used these
[46:41] phrases and stepped into the theophony
[46:44] body waiting for that glorious glorified
[46:48] body. Lord, we look forward to the
[46:51] marriage supper of the lamb. Oh God,
[46:54] we're planning on having a memorial
[46:56] service Tuesday, but we'd sooner be
[46:58] gathered around the marriage table. Lord
[47:01] Jesus, thy will be done. Take the word
[47:04] this morning. Take the vessel, oh God.
[47:07] And in our weakness and frailty, speak
[47:09] and may the Holy Ghost be the one that
[47:12] utters the words. We pray that they will
[47:14] find their uh per uh their their place
[47:17] in the heart, Lord God, and that every
[47:20] person will be greatly built up,
[47:22] strengthened, benefited, perhaps
[47:24] directed or redirected in Jesus Christ's
[47:27] name for your glory. Amen. Thank you,
[47:31] Lord. Amen. I'll invite you to turn in
[47:34] your Bibles, if you would, please, to
[47:37] Luke the 24th chapter.
[47:43] And then keep your Bible
[47:45] uh at the ready if you would please
[47:48] because we will be going then later on
[47:52] into uh other scriptures. But I'm going
[47:57] to be reading considerable from later
[48:01] on, Lord willing, out of Genesis, the
[48:04] 37th chapter,
[48:09] starting at verse 25
[48:12] down through verse 27. Luke 24:2.
[48:17] Then he said unto them, "Oh fools and
[48:20] slow of heart." And that slow of heart
[48:23] means slow to apprehend or believe or to
[48:26] be dull in mind or inactive in mind. But
[48:32] we don't want to be that way this
[48:34] morning. And uh it's slow in heart to
[48:37] believe all that the prophets have
[48:39] spoken. Ought not Christ to have
[48:42] suffered these things and to enter into
[48:45] his glory? And beginning at Moses and
[48:48] all the prophets, he expounded unto them
[48:51] in all the scriptures the things
[48:55] concerning himself. Isn't that a
[48:58] marvelous scripture?
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And beginning at Moses
[49:02] and all the prophets, Brother Brandham
[49:05] said, "Oh, he'd love to have heard him."
[49:07] And he expounded unto them in all the
[49:10] scriptures the things concerning
[49:13] himself. May God bless his word to our
[49:17] hearts as you have your seat.
[49:22] I would really appreciate your full and
[49:26] kind attention
[49:28] and to be just as alert as possible and
[49:32] don't allow your mind to be distracted.
[49:35] And the reason I say that is because I'm
[49:37] attempting
[49:39] this morning to perhaps sometimes you
[49:41] reach out into areas that uh may not be
[49:46] just entirely clear to yourself, even to
[49:50] myself. But you know that there's
[49:53] something there and it's it is dealing
[49:56] with something in the message that
[49:59] perhaps you've had question about. Uh I
[50:03] don't question things in the message but
[50:05] you can have questions about the
[50:06] message. You understand? I don't
[50:09] question say well now was he right here
[50:12] but no I don't question that but I
[50:14] question uh when I may see brother
[50:17] Brandham lean one way in one area and
[50:20] then lean another way in another area
[50:22] say it one way at one time say it
[50:24] another way another time. I don't
[50:27] question why he does that, but I
[50:29] question uh in myself my own
[50:32] understanding that I might understand
[50:35] why he's doing that. There's a reason
[50:37] for it and we want to know why he's
[50:39] doing that. And just keep your heart
[50:41] open so that God will at the appointed
[50:44] time start speaking to your movie in
[50:47] such a way to say, "Oh, now I
[50:50] understand." And so this morning's
[50:53] service and I'll probably have to take
[50:55] another service or two on this but stay
[50:58] with me please if you would.
[51:00] Brother Brandham speaks of this time
[51:03] when uh uh uh in the rising of the sun
[51:07] he says that the resurrection week was
[51:09] the greatest week in in history.
[51:12] And he uses this phrase and it's the
[51:14] only time that I find that he uses it.
[51:17] He said it was the secret of life
[51:21] after death being not it wasn't he
[51:25] didn't say being revealed he calls it
[51:26] the secret of life because the Easter
[51:29] seal the seal was broken
[51:33] and the secret of life after death
[51:36] &gt;&gt; now was made known.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Now they didn't know that it was being
[51:42] made known. They were simply walking
[51:44] with a man and they didn't realize it
[51:48] was another kind of a body. They didn't
[51:51] realize it was another kind of a life.
[51:54] Listen friends, that could happen to any
[51:56] one of you.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; That could happen to any believer in
[52:00] this message. And I trust that we will
[52:02] have that experience that we will walk
[52:06] with the resurrected.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; We will walk with the elected redeemed.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; You talk about achievement. To me that's
[52:13] the greatest achievement I think that we
[52:15] could possibly have. And so it was the
[52:19] greatest week in history. And he said
[52:21] the secret of life after death was
[52:24] revealed before that time we didn't
[52:28] know.
[52:30] Now the secret of this life that we have
[52:33] even right now the secret of life. I've
[52:36] been uh thinking about that. I I'm going
[52:39] be using that term in the scripture uh
[52:42] quite a bit in the service. The secret
[52:44] of this life had been foreshadowed all
[52:48] through the Bible.
[52:50] The secret of the life of Jesus Christ
[52:53] had been foreshadowed all through the
[52:55] Bible. But the secret had not been let
[52:59] out
[53:02] &gt;&gt; until this time until the Easter seal
[53:06] was broken or I just like to say the
[53:09] seal was broken
[53:12] and then uh the by the resurrection and
[53:16] then it was made known. What had been
[53:19] secret now had been made known.
[53:23] Now in our natural life
[53:27] and our natural life and in our birth or
[53:30] by birth we are born with certain gifts
[53:34] and traits,
[53:36] talents and skills.
[53:39] But our parents don't know exactly
[53:43] what's going to come of us. They don't
[53:46] know exactly what we're going to become.
[53:49] And many parents are many parents are
[53:52] actually very pleasantly surprised. Some
[53:54] may be disappointed because they have
[53:57] higher goals in mind for their children.
[54:01] But there are there are men and women we
[54:05] have in life maybe certain opportunities
[54:08] or circumstances
[54:10] uh of life just devolve in a certain way
[54:14] and move us into a certain channel and
[54:16] and uh you know bingo. There's uh we we
[54:19] we surprise ourselves. Maybe I have
[54:23] something here. Don't don't be afraid.
[54:26] But it's a
[54:32] masterpiece
[54:34] of a handmade knife.
[54:38] It's just magnificent. It's ironwood.
[54:42] It's uh turquoise stone from Arizona.
[54:48] It's ivory in the middle.
[54:51] It has special
[54:54] uh little buds or rivets there that come
[54:58] from Texas.
[55:01] So, it comes from many different places.
[55:03] The steel is very special steel because
[55:08] it's been sent to California to a
[55:10] certain place that hardens that steel to
[55:14] the hardest degree it can be.
[55:18] And uh but this has been made by a man
[55:23] and it's made just in a room or two of
[55:26] his little trailer home. And that man is
[55:29] brother Mike Vineyard.
[55:32] I I now this is right in very fitting,
[55:36] brother Mike. I put this in my briefcase
[55:38] yesterday.
[55:41] I never cease to look at the knives that
[55:45] our brother vineyard has made and I
[55:49] cannot conceive in my mind. I cannot
[55:52] grasp how that man takes a rough piece
[55:57] of steel and turns it into this kind of
[56:00] a this is a a a gifted man.
[56:05] And his father makes the
[56:09] holster for it and it just fits so
[56:11] perfect and snug and just a little click
[56:14] in there so it doesn't come out.
[56:19] I doubt if Mike Vineyard's parents ever
[56:23] dreamed that he would take a piece of
[56:26] coal steel and make this kind of a
[56:30] beautiful thing.
[56:33] This has special meaning to me and it
[56:36] was very appropriate this morning,
[56:37] Brother Mike. I didn't I didn't know I
[56:40] was going to do this, but I just thought
[56:42] it was so appropriate
[56:45] because the gift and talent that lies
[56:48] within a person, now I want you to catch
[56:51] this, remains a secret
[56:55] until it's manifested.
[56:58] And then what was in them is interpreted
[57:03] by what they're able to do.
[57:07] You could not live the life of this
[57:10] message
[57:11] &gt;&gt; unless the author and the spirit
[57:14] &gt;&gt; of God who wrote the word
[57:17] &gt;&gt; and said this is what's going to happen.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to send Elijah the prophet
[57:23] &gt;&gt; and he is going to turn the hearts of
[57:26] the children to the fathers.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; You were not able or capable within
[57:32] yourself. You were not born with the
[57:34] ability or the skills to to live the
[57:38] kind of life that the message describes.
[57:41] But when God spoke and uttered and said,
[57:44] "This is the kind of life these people
[57:46] are going to live." And somehow a
[57:49] special grace came upon a certain people
[57:53] and that's called elected people. It's
[57:56] called predestinated people. It's called
[57:59] the children of God people. It's called
[58:03] by the prophet the Exodus people.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; You did not have that ability. You did
[58:08] not have that skill. But God placed a
[58:12] seed down in there. And I want you to
[58:15] remember the word seed because we we
[58:19] cannot even be imagine or or begin to
[58:23] comprehend or grasp the power that's
[58:26] within the seed. But the prophet said
[58:29] there was potentials within the seed to
[58:32] transform uh to transform whatever was
[58:36] in the seed into its species.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; So it's not you or I.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; It's not within us. It's not it's not
[58:44] we're not capable of it of it. But the
[58:47] word that you believe and he said if you
[58:49] get it in the right channel,
[58:51] &gt;&gt; it will bring forth what has been spoken
[58:54] by the creator. Amen.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; So even in natural sometimes we don't
[59:01] know that someone is gifted as a as a
[59:05] musician or as a uh be it a pianist or
[59:10] one of the other instruments. We just
[59:11] aren't aware of that. But it becomes
[59:15] known to us.
[59:18] The Bible speaks and says this. And God
[59:22] said, "Let the earth bring forth grass
[59:25] and herb yielding seed and the fruit
[59:28] tree yielding fruit after his kind whose
[59:32] seed
[59:33] is in itself."
[59:36] When I say seed, I want you to think of
[59:38] word. I want you to think of spoken
[59:41] word.
[59:43] And everything falls on this falls at
[59:47] this point right here. It focuses on
[59:50] this point and that is
[59:53] there's no shortage of words in the
[59:56] world.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; There's no shortage of books in the
[59:59] world. There's no shortage of theories
[1:00:02] in the world. There's no shortage of
[1:00:05] opinions in the world. And there's no
[1:00:07] shortage of preachers in the world.
[1:00:10] There's no shortage of of of what people
[1:00:13] declare as truth. and one goes east and
[1:00:16] one goes west and another goes another
[1:00:19] direction. All the directions in the uh
[1:00:23] on the globe and all say it's all truth.
[1:00:26] But we can we can ask then where is
[1:00:29] truth?
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; And who is the author of truth?
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And if God is the author of truth then
[1:00:36] it's up to God. It's his responsibility
[1:00:39] to prove who it is that's speaking. And
[1:00:43] this is what I say about the message.
[1:00:46] The one reason I have a a an unmovable
[1:00:50] unequivocal
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; uh confidence within the message is
[1:00:54] because it is the one message that
[1:00:57] almighty God attended to and accompanied
[1:01:01] in a supernatural way.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; I want the congregation to say yay or
[1:01:06] nay.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; That is true. Then here we are as a
[1:01:12] people. What is our not responsibility
[1:01:15] but what is our privilege? Our privilege
[1:01:19] if if God will grant grace so that you
[1:01:22] can believe it. And I would say that to
[1:01:25] all that are here if there's any
[1:01:27] question or hesitation in your mind you
[1:01:30] ought to move it out of the way quickly
[1:01:32] because I can say one thing from history
[1:01:35] and from all the religious history you
[1:01:37] may have. There has been no message. No
[1:01:41] message. If there has been and you know
[1:01:43] it, you come and tell me after this
[1:01:45] service and don't hesitate. Be very
[1:01:48] quick. I have not found or heard of ever
[1:01:51] in history a message that has been so
[1:01:54] confirmed,
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; so proven,
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; so vindicated
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; as a message that you have had the
[1:02:02] privilege to hear.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; And you ought to be able to stand and
[1:02:06] say, "Oh, glory to God." Not because
[1:02:09] we're just enthused or excited, but
[1:02:12] because we're privileged of the people
[1:02:14] of the earth to have such a word come to
[1:02:18] us. I say glory to God.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; And that word is a seed.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; It's eternal life seed.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:32] Someone has said and I found this phrase
[1:02:35] actually it's a large article
[1:02:38] and I was searching for what is in a
[1:02:41] seed
[1:02:44] and this gentleman said in a seed lies
[1:02:46] the fierce fierce force of life.
[1:02:53] The drive within them is stronger than
[1:02:57] any other
[1:02:59] on our planet
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; and that to survive.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; It must spring forth.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And he speaks of the glory and the
[1:03:08] wonder of it. It goes into the ground
[1:03:10] singular and comes up multiplied
[1:03:14] because the drive and the force within
[1:03:16] it is to reproduce. Amen.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And the prophet goes back and says, he
[1:03:22] takes the phrase bring forth.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; That's what's doing it.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; That's what's doing it.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; That's why you put a seed in the ground
[1:03:32] and in the fall time. Here it comes up.
[1:03:35] It comes up maybe from the bloom and the
[1:03:37] flower and the stalk and finally it's
[1:03:39] multiplied many times. But it's there's
[1:03:42] a force within it. This gentleman has
[1:03:45] said the fierce force of life that's in
[1:03:49] his seed.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:52] And if God has done that for a potato
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; or for a carrot
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; or for a tomato,
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; how much more for his sons and daughters
[1:04:05] of God
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; to bring forth his life and to express
[1:04:10] what he said, bring forth,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; multiply. I'm not talking about
[1:04:14] multiplying in a in a natural way, but
[1:04:17] multiply his image.
[1:04:21] bring forth him on the earth.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; And this has been the great secret.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; And incidentally, I will just say this
[1:04:31] to some of you that may be more familiar
[1:04:34] with the message.
[1:04:36] While I go through this, I want you to
[1:04:37] think about the seventh seal
[1:04:42] and his coming.
[1:04:47] You're nice and quiet.
[1:04:51] There's places where brother Brandham
[1:04:53] speaks about the seventh seal as though
[1:04:56] it is opened
[1:04:58] and it's happened and the seventh seal
[1:05:01] is his coming.
[1:05:03] And then he speaks of we know that the
[1:05:06] seventh seal is isn't opened.
[1:05:09] Well, you can't have it opened and not
[1:05:11] opened. And yet on one side you're
[1:05:15] smiling
[1:05:17] on one side
[1:05:20] uh you say so we have whole groups
[1:05:22] within the message. Oh has nothing to do
[1:05:24] with us. It's not open and we got other
[1:05:27] groups and they got all the courses
[1:05:28] about it is open since the opening of
[1:05:31] the seals. So you say so here we are and
[1:05:36] and we uh say well we need somebody to
[1:05:39] explain it. Well you can't explain it.
[1:05:41] God has to just reveal it.
[1:05:45] I'll just give you a clue and then
[1:05:47] you'll kind of know where I'm going.
[1:05:50] Brother Brandham said
[1:05:53] it was Christ in Joseph.
[1:05:57] It was Christ in Isaac.
[1:06:00] It was Christ in Moses.
[1:06:03] It was Christ in David when he was
[1:06:05] rejected. And yet David and he goes to
[1:06:09] he goes into depth and he says and he
[1:06:11] says all my bones my bones the personal
[1:06:14] pronoun my bones they stare at me and he
[1:06:18] says and he was rejected and and but he
[1:06:22] said it was Christ he was acting out
[1:06:27] but there's no record anywhere in this
[1:06:29] scripture and I'm going to be going into
[1:06:31] Joseph. There's no script there's no
[1:06:34] place anywhere in the scripture where
[1:06:37] anyone of those people of the Old
[1:06:41] Testament rejoiced in in what they were
[1:06:45] typifying or what they were expressing.
[1:06:48] None of them said David never said, "Oh,
[1:06:51] but there's a greater one. I'm so happy
[1:06:54] to be rejected because there's a greater
[1:06:56] one that's coming. It's a Messiah and
[1:06:59] he's going to be rejected and I'm so
[1:07:02] thankful that I can act out my part.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; they didn't know it.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; It was a secret.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; But the secret was Christ was coming.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Christ was coming.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; They were part of the coming.
[1:07:21] And then now we come down and forgive
[1:07:24] me, I'm kind of getting ahead of myself,
[1:07:25] but now we comes into the end time
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; and we have a a last messenger.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; And I don't dispute we have a last
[1:07:34] messenger
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; and we have the unfolding of the word.
[1:07:38] And now he's been sent to speak the
[1:07:41] opening of the seals. And he comes to
[1:07:43] the seventh. He says it's his coming.
[1:07:47] But there's a part yet that has not been
[1:07:52] fulfilled or hasn't happened because it
[1:07:55] has to be acted out.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; It has to be manifested in a people. And
[1:08:01] that's a secret part of it because we
[1:08:04] don't even know it.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; When I say we don't know it, we we know
[1:08:12] it
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; in the interpretation.
[1:08:15] Are you listening?
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Is everybody listening?
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; I have to lay these things out in the
[1:08:22] interpretation when we say
[1:08:26] uh this is the interpretation.
[1:08:29] So we say all right
[1:08:32] verbally or in speech we can say here's
[1:08:36] a person speaking another language but
[1:08:38] he's going to interpret what I'm saying.
[1:08:41] So he's going to take the one sound and
[1:08:44] translate it and put it into a different
[1:08:46] verbiage and someone else can. So that
[1:08:49] we say well that is interpretation
[1:08:52] or we have someone reading the scripture
[1:08:56] and we say well this is what it means
[1:08:59] and so we have an interpretation
[1:09:02] of the scripture and we have churches
[1:09:04] spotted all over the country.
[1:09:08] I thought I would try to say what is the
[1:09:11] secret in life and I went on to the
[1:09:14] website and I got on just one person's
[1:09:17] website about the secret of life or the
[1:09:20] secret in life or the secret of life and
[1:09:23] this one started out you are so lucky
[1:09:27] that you got onto this page.
[1:09:30] I thought, "Wow, I am so lucky." I got
[1:09:34] on onto this page, seeking the secret of
[1:09:37] life. You have found it. You're in the
[1:09:40] right place. I thought, "Wow, this guy
[1:09:43] must really have something to say." And
[1:09:45] so I looked to see how many people that
[1:09:47] clicked on. There was only one before
[1:09:49] me.
[1:09:51] I thought, "Well, we're two lucky people
[1:09:53] on the earth."
[1:09:55] I thought, "If this man only knew." And
[1:09:57] I read what he had to say. And you know
[1:09:59] what he had to say? nothing, absolutely
[1:10:02] zero. In fact is I was expecting him to
[1:10:06] say something astounding but it was
[1:10:07] really below zero. There was there was
[1:10:11] just nothing there. I thought how
[1:10:14] pathetic and here I am. I I just said
[1:10:19] I'm off of Google.
[1:10:21] I tell you what, when you got a message
[1:10:23] you don't need to Google.
[1:10:26] All these people have got all kinds of
[1:10:27] ideas. And so there's no shortage of
[1:10:30] opinions. There's no shortage of
[1:10:32] theories. There's no shortage of
[1:10:35] messages which are interpreting the
[1:10:37] word. But you know what? We have one who
[1:10:41] has actually interpreted the word and
[1:10:44] able to say thus sayaeth the Lord and
[1:10:47] then have God come behind him and
[1:10:50] confirm that it is God speaking because
[1:10:54] it's not a man speaking when he's
[1:10:56] revealing the secret of a heart.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Right.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And so we we call that which is in you
[1:11:07] as a believer as potentials. You have
[1:11:11] the potential
[1:11:13] to uh unfold the hour. And brother
[1:11:17] Brandham, I'll give you the key. Brother
[1:11:20] Brandham says two or three times he says
[1:11:22] this. Now this is the key. He said when
[1:11:26] he was speaking to the woman at the
[1:11:28] well, when he was speaking to Nathan
[1:11:30] Nathaniel,
[1:11:32] he said his own life
[1:11:35] was the interpretation.
[1:11:38] His life his life what he was living. He
[1:11:42] didn't get out and say, "I'm the
[1:11:44] interpretation of the scripture." But
[1:11:46] what the scripture said would happen at
[1:11:50] that season. and and and did say maybe
[1:11:53] didn't even say it would be at that
[1:11:54] season, but the scripture says a virgin
[1:11:57] shall conceive. Well, she didn't come
[1:11:59] and say, you know what, folks, I'm going
[1:12:01] to interpret that scripture. No, she
[1:12:04] just lived her life like a like a young
[1:12:07] lady and believed the word of God and
[1:12:10] bore forth a child, a manchild when she
[1:12:14] was still a virgin. Even though she
[1:12:16] said, "How can this be?" But it was.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; It was. Why was it? Because the power
[1:12:23] and the strength of the spoken word was
[1:12:27] in that seed.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Are you able to follow me?
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; But it was still a mystery. It was still
[1:12:37] a secret. She didn't know what kind of a
[1:12:39] child. She didn't know. All she knew
[1:12:42] that the angel had said, you know,
[1:12:43] she'll call his name Jesus, for he shall
[1:12:45] save his people from their sins. But
[1:12:48] they don't know how it's going to happen
[1:12:50] or what the manifestation's going to be.
[1:12:52] But Jesus himself didn't come and say,
[1:12:55] "I'll interpret this for you." His life
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; was the interpretation of the scripture.
[1:13:02] I want to say to this congregation and
[1:13:05] every believer, I'm talking about solid
[1:13:07] believers of the message, your life,
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; your life
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; with your hardships and with your
[1:13:14] weaknesses and with your frailties and
[1:13:17] with everything else that you en
[1:13:19] encounter in life. But your life
[1:13:22] ultimately interprets the word of God
[1:13:25] for this season.
[1:13:29] And you don't have to go, you don't have
[1:13:31] to go and interpret it for people. Your
[1:13:33] life will interpret it.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Our life is declaring Malachi 4
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; has happened.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Your life because you have believed this
[1:13:44] is a vindicated prophet from God. Your
[1:13:47] life confirms. Your life proves
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; that what was said had power in it.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Read brother Brown said the seed
[1:14:02] possesses the potentials and power of
[1:14:05] transformation
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; as long as it stays in its channel.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; So it's not just an absolute that no
[1:14:12] matter what you do or anything it's
[1:14:14] going to happen but we have to stay with
[1:14:16] the right attitude and in the right in
[1:14:20] channel for it to take place. And this
[1:14:22] is what he said. And everything under
[1:14:24] control to bring forth of its kind.
[1:14:28] He said, "Now remember to bring to
[1:14:31] bring." And he brings that in quotation
[1:14:33] mark to bring.
[1:14:36] When he put the seed in the earth, the
[1:14:38] seed can only come forth with the power
[1:14:41] of life within it.
[1:14:44] We cannot bring forth anything more than
[1:14:47] what God has deposited in us.
[1:14:50] And anything that has achieved all glory
[1:14:53] is to God.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; He said his transform his transforming
[1:14:59] power. Now God put the seed in there
[1:15:03] with potentials that it would be what he
[1:15:07] said it would be. So whatever he has
[1:15:10] said it would be, you
[1:15:13] going to bring that forth
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; and nothing is going to stop it. Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; He went on to say, "As long as it stayed
[1:15:22] in the right category,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; it would be just exactly what God said
[1:15:26] it would be.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; It had to be that way because he had
[1:15:29] made it that way and made a channel."
[1:15:33] Oh, I thank God for the channel.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; I thank God that that channel's a
[1:15:37] reality this morning. And we can be in
[1:15:39] that channel. If you're not in the
[1:15:41] channel, you can say, "Father,
[1:15:43] you have spoken a word. You have made a
[1:15:46] channel for me. You've made an
[1:15:48] opportunity. So don't look upon this as
[1:15:50] just another service. Search out that
[1:15:53] channel. Say, I perhaps I can't just
[1:15:55] exactly find it, but you put it in my
[1:15:57] heart and soul and cause me to believe
[1:16:01] and and that I might enter into that
[1:16:03] channel. He said that anything that
[1:16:05] stays in his channel, in his line of
[1:16:09] word, it will have to bring forth
[1:16:11] exactly like his word said it would do.
[1:16:15] It cannot move from there.
[1:16:18] And then he says, "And each one of those
[1:16:20] seeds has power in itself to transform
[1:16:24] itself into the specy."
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; I want to ask this congregation,
[1:16:29] you believe
[1:16:31] in the predestination.
[1:16:34] You believe that?
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, you do. And in God's mind, he put
[1:16:40] it was God. It's not you that wants to
[1:16:43] bring forth something. It's God.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "I want a palm tree to look
[1:16:48] like a palm tree. I want an oak tree to
[1:16:49] be like an oak tree." So, he put what
[1:16:52] was ever pictured in his mind. You
[1:16:54] didn't conceive how an oak tree would
[1:16:56] look. He did.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; We didn't conceive how a palm tree would
[1:17:01] look. He did.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; And he put that power in a seed.
[1:17:05] And the last of all
[1:17:09] expressions upon the earth must must
[1:17:15] be the creator himself.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring my image
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; down onto the earth.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; I am the God of creation.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; And so he allowed people who would
[1:17:35] believe his word. Though one would
[1:17:37] disbelieve or others would disbelieve,
[1:17:39] he allowed in the seed a power and we
[1:17:44] believe things we don't even know why we
[1:17:46] believe it.
[1:17:48] Why do you believe the message?
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I can't give you, you know,
[1:17:53] specifics why I believe it. There's just
[1:17:56] something within that says I believe it.
[1:17:58] People say, well, uh, you know, they
[1:18:02] find all kinds of faults and so on. To
[1:18:04] me, it's just wonderful.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; And the more I look at it, the more
[1:18:08] wonderful it is.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; The more beautiful it is,
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; the more perfect it is.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus, when he was here, he had
[1:18:17] frailties. Listen, he had very
[1:18:19] intelligent people find all kinds of
[1:18:21] fault with him. But there was a handful
[1:18:25] of people that saw no fault with him.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; And in in fact is uh when he when he
[1:18:32] came before Pilate who's supposed to
[1:18:34] find the fault could find no fault. When
[1:18:37] he finally was put under the magnifying
[1:18:40] glass of the law he said I find no fault
[1:18:44] with him.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; What a rebuke
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; to a bunch of religious people that
[1:18:49] should have been able to discover that.
[1:18:54] Isn't it wonderful?
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; I find no fault. And I say today, this
[1:19:00] Jesus
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; that has been described, this Jesus that
[1:19:04] has been manifested, I find no fault
[1:19:07] with him whatsoever.
[1:19:10] Amen.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And it is he, the author of life, who
[1:19:16] said, "I
[1:19:18] I am God
[1:19:20] and I am going to be glorified. I'm
[1:19:24] going to be seen. I'm going to be
[1:19:27] recognized. I'm going to be expressed on
[1:19:29] the earth. And you may not realize it,
[1:19:32] but I'm going to make a declaration. And
[1:19:34] that declaration is this. I don't care
[1:19:37] how you feel. I don't care how many
[1:19:40] times you failed.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care anything else about your
[1:19:43] life. If God
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; has called you,
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; if God ordained that you shall express
[1:19:52] him,
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; there is a part of your life.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't want this to sound foolish,
[1:19:59] but you know, you might say this
[1:20:02] morning, I got to go and brush my teeth.
[1:20:04] Well, that's not really here. That's
[1:20:06] just, you know, what God give you some
[1:20:09] gray matter about. I I need to What'll I
[1:20:13] wear this morning? Well, that's not part
[1:20:16] of the mystery.
[1:20:18] So, you
[1:20:21] just say, "Well, you know, I'm going to
[1:20:23] get dressed. I'm going to get I'm going
[1:20:25] to go to church. I'm going to worship
[1:20:26] God." Oh, now now you said something
[1:20:28] worthwhile.
[1:20:31] I'm gonna worship God. And then and and
[1:20:34] then and then maybe you know something
[1:20:36] happens and the toast burns and the tire
[1:20:38] is flat and this goes
[1:20:41] I just feel all all churned up. You know
[1:20:44] just take it easy. Uh you know there's
[1:20:48] power in the seed
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; to transform it and make it the species
[1:20:52] that it's supposed to be
[1:20:55] and it works down into our into our
[1:20:57] ordinary life and our regular life. My
[1:21:00] let me carry on. So there's two parts to
[1:21:03] interpretation. Two parts. You can have
[1:21:06] a verbal interpretation.
[1:21:09] You can have someone stand up and speak
[1:21:11] an interpretation. They can declare,
[1:21:14] "I'm interpreting. This is what the
[1:21:16] Bible speaks." And then I I've had
[1:21:20] people say it and I've been aware of it
[1:21:22] for many, many years.
[1:21:25] Brother Scoffield has I was holding my
[1:21:27] Bible once and brother Brandham says,
[1:21:29] "Oh, I see." He says, "Brother Eddie, I
[1:21:31] see you have a Scullfield Bible." I
[1:21:34] said, "Yeah." And he he took it. He
[1:21:36] said, "That's that's exactly the Bible I
[1:21:38] carry." He said, "I like old Dr.
[1:21:40] Scoffield." He said, he said, you know,
[1:21:42] and that's exactly what he said. I like
[1:21:44] old Dr. Scoffield. He said, you know, he
[1:21:46] uh and and I read in the message places
[1:21:49] when he goes into the mysteries in out
[1:21:52] of Matthew, the mysteries of the
[1:21:53] kingdom. Brother Brandham actually
[1:21:55] quotes
[1:21:58] Scoffield word for word,
[1:22:02] but and then people say, "Well, Brother
[1:22:05] Bam, he he just quoted Scoffield." Yeah.
[1:22:08] Uh well, he said also that it's to tie
[1:22:11] the loose ends together. He said in
[1:22:14] other places, don't say they were wrong.
[1:22:17] The there's been truth coming all the
[1:22:19] way down. But if you read all the
[1:22:21] mysteries of the kingdom that brother
[1:22:23] Brandham gives, there's one on the end.
[1:22:26] He quotes Scoffield, but he adds one
[1:22:31] because it was necessary. If you're
[1:22:33] going to get all the mysteries of the
[1:22:35] kingdom, you needed one more and it took
[1:22:38] a prophet to add that one to it.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Are you following me thus far? So,
[1:22:43] there's a spoken part of interpretation
[1:22:46] of the scripture. And then, and here's
[1:22:49] where you and I come in.
[1:22:51] Then there's the unspoken part. It's a
[1:22:54] lived out part.
[1:22:57] And I'm going to show you from the
[1:22:58] scripture where prior to Christ's
[1:23:01] physical coming, it they lived out parts
[1:23:06] of Christ's coming,
[1:23:08] but they didn't know it. It still
[1:23:11] remained a mystery. It was a secret. It
[1:23:15] was silent.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; When the seventh seal was open, there
[1:23:21] was a half hour of silence. If you ask
[1:23:24] me what is a half hour, I don't know. I
[1:23:26] don't know what the half hour refers to,
[1:23:28] but I know that it was silent. There's a
[1:23:31] silent aspect to his coming. And when he
[1:23:35] slipped in and when he came and and and
[1:23:38] I read the scripture and and there was
[1:23:41] no great roar, thunder, lightning,
[1:23:44] flashes of light. He just came out of
[1:23:47] the tomb. Nobody knew he came out of the
[1:23:49] tomb. And this was all part of his
[1:23:51] coming.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Now he was come. Actually, this was the
[1:23:55] key.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; This was the secret of life after death.
[1:24:02] There's no big bang, no big no big
[1:24:04] announcement, no big preacher to tell it
[1:24:07] happened. It just happened. Just crept
[1:24:10] in.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And that was part of his coming. It was
[1:24:13] still his coming. And there is that.
[1:24:16] That was the key part. He wanted to show
[1:24:18] them. This is the body that you'll have
[1:24:21] a body like my glorious body because I
[1:24:24] live. You live. Oh. And and they were in
[1:24:27] the midst of their lowest moment.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Hello. Maybe somebody's here in their
[1:24:32] low moment. I got good news for you.
[1:24:35] Maybe somebody's here feeling I'm a
[1:24:37] total failure. I got good news for you.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; The power of that seed does not depend
[1:24:45] on what you can do with it or what you
[1:24:47] don't do with it. If you stay in the
[1:24:49] channel, the power of that seed will
[1:24:52] bring forth his image
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; for this hour, for this season. And I
[1:24:57] want to say one more thing. This is the
[1:25:00] season of his coming.
[1:25:02] [Music]
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; This is the season of his coming. And
[1:25:08] you are living part of that coming.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to speak about Joseph
[1:25:18] in a few moments.
[1:25:21] And you'll have to really keep your
[1:25:22] thinking cap on.
[1:25:29] Brother Brandon speaks about Joseph,
[1:25:33] Joseph's life. Now, often when we think
[1:25:35] about Joseph, we think about Joseph and
[1:25:36] the and his brethren bowing to him and
[1:25:39] so on and so forth. And we have Israel
[1:25:41] that but just a second. Joseph's life
[1:25:45] spans the entire life of Jesus Christ
[1:25:48] really. So he spans part of his life
[1:25:52] relates to you sitting here this
[1:25:55] morning.
[1:25:56] and I couldn't tie that together. And
[1:25:59] part of his life spans right when uh
[1:26:02] when we're in the millennium and Jesus
[1:26:05] is making himself known as the Messiah
[1:26:08] to his brethren.
[1:26:11] Part of that is there. So we we'll go
[1:26:15] into that. His his life spans the life
[1:26:18] of Jesus Christ on both his first and
[1:26:21] second coming. I put it that way.
[1:26:25] His life therefore relates to all of us
[1:26:28] as we are the body of Jesus Christ. If
[1:26:32] he if his life related to and expressed
[1:26:36] Jesus Christ and you have Jesus Christ
[1:26:40] in you, it's impossible to separate what
[1:26:43] he was expressing from what you're
[1:26:46] living.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; To whom God would make known what is the
[1:26:53] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:26:56] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:26:58] you the hope of glory. Brother Bram said
[1:27:01] I was talking I was taking the life of
[1:27:03] Joseph in the Bible and there and he
[1:27:06] said there was a man there was nothing
[1:27:07] against Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all
[1:27:10] the others had something against them
[1:27:12] but not Joseph. What a man, a perfect
[1:27:15] man, a perfect type of Christ. He said,
[1:27:18] "When I read that, I just got to
[1:27:20] crying."
[1:27:23] One day, he said, "In my hotel room, and
[1:27:25] I went over in the closet where my
[1:27:27] clothes were hanging." Look at how
[1:27:30] simple this is.
[1:27:32] And I pulled the door together and I
[1:27:35] said, "God,
[1:27:36] I want to thank you for a man like
[1:27:38] Joseph.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; A man who once lived on the earth,
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; a man in flesh like I am. A man that
[1:27:48] could believe you and take your word. He
[1:27:51] was hated of his brethren.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't help being spiritual.
[1:27:57] You can't help having in you what God
[1:28:00] put in you.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; You did not ask for it. God determined.
[1:28:06] You're going to be this and I'm going to
[1:28:09] put this in you. And whether it comes
[1:28:12] easy or whether it comes hard, you're
[1:28:14] going to express me, the creator.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that gave you life. And this
[1:28:20] is the real purpose of that life.
[1:28:25] He saw visions. He could interpret
[1:28:28] dreams.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; And all of them hated him for it. He
[1:28:32] couldn't help that. That's just what he
[1:28:35] was.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; We can't help it. Sorry, world.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; And I don't apologize.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Devils, you can do what you wish. You
[1:28:45] can howl and scream and do whatever you
[1:28:49] want. You can throw all of your
[1:28:51] enchantments at our feet, but it won't
[1:28:54] work
[1:28:56] [Applause]
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; because there's just something within us
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; and we can't. We didn't ask for it. The
[1:29:06] almighty God put it there and that just
[1:29:10] happens to be the way it is.
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:17] the interpretation of the word in our
[1:29:20] own life.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; And to interpret says to give the
[1:29:25] meaning of or to explain,
[1:29:28] to give illustrative representation of.
[1:29:32] When we think of interpretation or
[1:29:34] interpreting, we usually think of
[1:29:36] somebody speaking or hearing it
[1:29:40] verbally.
[1:29:42] But I want to take it a little bit
[1:29:44] further. And Apostle Paul said, "If the
[1:29:47] trumpet gives an uncertain sound,
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; who shall prepare himself for battle? So
[1:29:54] likewise, except you utter by the
[1:29:57] tongue." Those are words that are easy
[1:30:00] to be understood. How shall it be known
[1:30:02] what is spoken? For you shall speak into
[1:30:05] the air. There are it may be so many
[1:30:08] kinds of voices in the world and none of
[1:30:11] them is without signification
[1:30:13] signification.
[1:30:15] Therefore, if I if I know not the
[1:30:19] meaning of the voice, I shall be to him
[1:30:21] that speaketh a barbarian, and he that
[1:30:24] speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.
[1:30:28] Now, I speak of the interpretation of
[1:30:30] the word in your own life.
[1:30:34] I'm taking a turning a corner. Are you
[1:30:36] rested enough? You all right?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Because I wouldn't want you to be too
[1:30:41] worried.
[1:30:45] Someone said the other day to brother
[1:30:46] Brandham, he said, someone said the
[1:30:48] other day when I was talking said,
[1:30:50] brother Brandham, you don't believe then
[1:30:53] the church will go through the
[1:30:54] tribulation.
[1:30:56] I said, I believe the church will, but
[1:30:58] not the bride.
[1:31:00] The church will go through the
[1:31:01] tribulation. Yes, sir. But the bride is
[1:31:04] free from it. She'll go in the rapture
[1:31:07] in a moment. In a twinkling of an eye,
[1:31:09] she'll be caught up to meet her Lord in
[1:31:11] the air for the wedding supper. She has
[1:31:14] nothing to go through any tribulation
[1:31:17] about. Her Lord has paid her price and
[1:31:20] we're so thankful for that.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "You may say to me, Brother
[1:31:24] Brandham, you've got the wrong
[1:31:26] interpretation of it." Well, that's your
[1:31:30] opinion.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "God don't need an
[1:31:33] interpreter."
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:35] Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Said, "You have an opinion. You have a
[1:31:37] right to an opinion." But God is his own
[1:31:40] interpreter.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And that's what the trouble of it is
[1:31:43] today.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; That's where the trouble is today. He
[1:31:48] said, "We've got too many manmade
[1:31:52] interpreters.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; God can interpret himself,
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; his own." Now, catch this, please. I had
[1:32:01] to I had to say it over several times to
[1:32:03] me. old. Now, I wish I could have had it
[1:32:04] on the on the on the screen, but please
[1:32:07] catch it this way.
[1:32:10] His own vindication
[1:32:13] of his word
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; is the interpretation.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; So now the vindication
[1:32:20] is the interpretation
[1:32:23] of the word.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on, God can interpret
[1:32:27] himself. His own vindication is his word
[1:32:31] in of his word is interpretation. He
[1:32:34] said the Pharisees might have cried out
[1:32:36] too. We got the interpretation. The
[1:32:39] Sadducees says we got it. But Jesus was
[1:32:44] the interpretation.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; So the vindication,
[1:32:52] the vindication
[1:32:55] is the interpretation. Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; And that is Jesus Christ.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; That is Christ.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; That's when you know you have Christ.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; We're not just talking about some signs
[1:33:10] and wonders and healings now and those
[1:33:12] things. He said
[1:33:15] that's what that's what they done to
[1:33:18] Jesus. They found out back there that
[1:33:21] they thought he didn't have the
[1:33:23] interpretation.
[1:33:25] He was the interpretation.
[1:33:28] God didn't have to interpret it. Jesus
[1:33:31] life interpreted it.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Nothing has changed from back there to
[1:33:36] this moment.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; The life of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:41] If the if Jesus Christ Now, there's
[1:33:44] millions that certainly believe this
[1:33:46] morning that the life of Jesus Christ is
[1:33:49] in them. And I'm not going to dispute
[1:33:51] that. I don't have to ridicule people.
[1:33:54] All I can say is this.
[1:33:57] If Jesus Christ who is the word is
[1:34:02] literally living in a person,
[1:34:05] their life
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; will be the interpretation
[1:34:10] of the scripture that God wrote for this
[1:34:12] hour.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Their life will be the interpretation.
[1:34:22] So all scriptures that refer to this day
[1:34:26] would only be words in a book or
[1:34:28] preached over a pulpit.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; But once God fulfills that word and the
[1:34:35] called ones believe it,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; the ones that have been birthed in that
[1:34:40] age and they are called to believe that
[1:34:43] word, then then the word is being
[1:34:46] interpreted by a lived out life. Amen.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says the woman at the well,
[1:34:58] she recognized it
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; she recognized her day
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; by the sign of the Messiah.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; That's how she recognized it.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus life.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; He was living out the life of the
[1:35:13] Messiah.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; And she recognized it while others
[1:35:17] thought it was the devil.
[1:35:19] Bub, she thought it was the Messiah.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; He said Nathaniel, a great Hebrew,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; he recognized it.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus was that promise.
[1:35:34] Jesus was that promise
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; of the scripture
[1:35:40] vindicated
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; to the woman
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; or he was the interpretation.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; The vindication or the interpretation.
[1:35:50] Now listen, this is so important. Jesus
[1:35:53] was the interpretation of the scripture.
[1:35:56] His own life interpreted the scripture.
[1:36:04] Multitudes of people can read. As it was
[1:36:08] in the days of Sodom, as it was in the
[1:36:10] days of Noah, so shall it also be in the
[1:36:12] day when the Son of Man
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; is revealed.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; And there's certainly a lot of ideas and
[1:36:20] opinions about that. Amen.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; And and and until the message came, I
[1:36:28] was a minister. I preached for several
[1:36:30] years. I traveled in evangelistic work
[1:36:33] through Washington, Oregon, Northern
[1:36:35] California, Idaho, Saskatchewan,
[1:36:37] Alberta, and British Columbia, that
[1:36:40] whole area, and preached in many, many,
[1:36:42] many churches. and had minister friends
[1:36:45] of mine who preached and some were
[1:36:48] believed in three gods or three
[1:36:51] trinitarians. Some believed only in two.
[1:36:54] The one that I was ministering with
[1:36:56] believed in two. Said, "I can't see a
[1:36:59] third." And they baptized this way, that
[1:37:02] way, whatever way. Went to Africa, they
[1:37:05] baptized for every sin a person could
[1:37:08] remember. And brother Willie Ratif was
[1:37:11] standing on the bank and the man was
[1:37:13] coming up and they're asking, you know,
[1:37:14] do you remember another one? Yeah. Oh,
[1:37:16] down he went again. Brother Willie
[1:37:18] actually walked over to him said,
[1:37:19] "You're drowning him."
[1:37:26] It is humorous, but that's just how
[1:37:29] sideways things were. It goes every
[1:37:31] direction. And this stuff I hesitate to
[1:37:35] even tell people that I'm a minister
[1:37:37] today because in the world they
[1:37:40] automatically put it to some television
[1:37:43] evangelist which is so far they're even
[1:37:46] a poor they're a poor example of
[1:37:49] Hollywood.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; I've seen some I know what I'm talking
[1:37:54] about. I think this is such trash.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; This is such garbage.
[1:38:02] And most of it's pointed towards money
[1:38:04] somehow to make money.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; And it's amazing. They have faith how
[1:38:09] God will give you money to give them the
[1:38:11] money, but their faith doesn't how come
[1:38:14] God doesn't do it for them.
[1:38:17] That's the mystery. Isn't that amazing?
[1:38:24] Let me go on
[1:38:27] your life. And this is the scripture.
[1:38:30] This is the quote rather that spoke to
[1:38:33] me so powerfully and uh while I was away
[1:38:36] and I've been pondering and making
[1:38:37] making notes and taking the thoughts and
[1:38:40] reading I've been I I felt led to start
[1:38:44] reading in Genesis and just read
[1:38:45] straight through Genesis and right at
[1:38:47] the end of Exodus right now just to see
[1:38:51] and I and when I got into the life of of
[1:38:54] Joseph
[1:38:56] uh I began to
[1:38:58] feel something very very strange.
[1:39:01] There's a secret mystery in Joseph's
[1:39:03] life. Can I continue on for just a
[1:39:04] little bit? There's a secret life that
[1:39:07] is secret mystery in Joseph's life. And
[1:39:10] although we have the account of his
[1:39:12] life, now I'm I'm teaching a bit here.
[1:39:15] Although we have the account of his life
[1:39:18] written here in the scripture and you
[1:39:19] can read it as I have as I read it and
[1:39:23] prayerfully
[1:39:24] his dreams
[1:39:26] and the dreams of others recorded in the
[1:39:29] scripture. You can read it. You can hear
[1:39:33] the dream.
[1:39:35] You can hear what happened afterward.
[1:39:38] And yet the mystery that is not even
[1:39:41] written
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; is the coming of the Lord.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; There's nothing said.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; He's cast into the pit. He's cast into
[1:39:51] the dungeon. He didn't say, "Oh, how
[1:39:55] wonderful. I'm representing the greatest
[1:39:59] week of history."
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't even know it.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; To him, he's in prison. To him, he's in
[1:40:09] the pit.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; To him, he's in one of his lowest
[1:40:12] moments.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; And so, his son's he has a dream. And
[1:40:16] the he has dreams. All right. If you
[1:40:19] want to just turn turn with me, we're
[1:40:23] just going to read a few verses and then
[1:40:25] I'm going to continue on for a bit.
[1:40:29] If you get too weary, I'll just quit.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; You want me to continue? Amen.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; That's good cuz I plan to anyway.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Genesis 37, we're just going to start at
[1:40:44] verse three. And now I come really down
[1:40:47] to the crunch of it.
[1:40:51] It's good for you to have your Bibles.
[1:40:54] Now, Israel, that was Jacob, loved
[1:40:57] Joseph more than all his children
[1:41:00] because he was the son of his old age.
[1:41:02] And he made him a coat of many colors.
[1:41:05] Brother Brandham said it was a covenant
[1:41:06] coat, the seven colors of the rainbow.
[1:41:09] And when his brethren saw that their
[1:41:11] father loved him more than all his
[1:41:13] brethren, they hated him and could not
[1:41:16] speak peaceibly to him. And Joseph
[1:41:19] dreamed a dream, and he told his
[1:41:20] brethren, and they hated him yet more.
[1:41:23] And he said, "Here, I pray you the dream
[1:41:25] which I dreamed. And behold, we were
[1:41:27] binding sheav in the field. And lo, my
[1:41:30] sheath arose, and also stood upright.
[1:41:33] And behold, your sheav stood around
[1:41:35] about and made obesence or bowed to my
[1:41:39] sheath. And his brethren said unto him,
[1:41:41] "Shalt thou indeed reign over us, or
[1:41:43] shalt thou have indeed have dominion
[1:41:46] over us?" Remember the scripture when
[1:41:47] Jesus came, they said, "We won't have
[1:41:50] this man to reign over us."
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; And they hated him yet the more. Verse
[1:41:55] eight, for his dreams, for his and for
[1:41:59] his words. And he dreamed yet another
[1:42:01] dream, and told his his brethren, and
[1:42:03] said, "Behold, I've dreamed a dream
[1:42:05] more, and behold, the sun and the moon
[1:42:07] and the 11 stars made obesence to me."
[1:42:10] And he told it to his father, and to his
[1:42:12] brethren. And his father rebuked him,
[1:42:15] and said unto him, "What is this dream
[1:42:17] that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy
[1:42:20] mother and thy brethren indeed come and
[1:42:22] to bow down ourselves to thee in the
[1:42:25] earth? And his brethren envied him, but
[1:42:28] his father observed the saying.
[1:42:33] All right. The dreams give no details of
[1:42:38] what, listen now, no details of what
[1:42:42] Joseph will go through before the dreams
[1:42:46] are fulfilled.
[1:42:49] You may know God saved me. God called me
[1:42:53] to redemption. God has called me to be a
[1:42:56] son of God. But you do not know.
[1:43:00] Perhaps you have a bit of a record now,
[1:43:02] but you don't know what it entails
[1:43:06] for you to be that.
[1:43:09] And there are, you might agree with this
[1:43:11] or you might disagree with it, but there
[1:43:13] are segments or portions of your life
[1:43:16] that are not all written in the word of
[1:43:20] God. And they don't they apply to this
[1:43:22] life. God put you here and you have God
[1:43:25] didn't say thus says the Lord, thou
[1:43:27] shalt go to school when you become six
[1:43:30] years old. He didn't say that. He didn't
[1:43:33] perhaps announce who your teacher was
[1:43:36] going to be. He didn't tell you thus
[1:43:38] sayeth the Lord, thou shalt go to
[1:43:40] college and have some further education.
[1:43:44] He didn't say thou thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:43:47] thou shalt be skilled in computer
[1:43:49] sciences or you shall be gifted as a
[1:43:52] mechanic or you shall be a special woman
[1:43:56] as a mother, a housewife or whatever
[1:43:59] more. He didn't say that.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; But he said one thing and declared one
[1:44:05] thing. I have written certain things in
[1:44:08] this word
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; and they are time locked and some were
[1:44:13] for Joseph's day some were for Moses day
[1:44:16] some were for Samuel's day David's day
[1:44:19] some were for Christ's day some were for
[1:44:22] the apostles day and some were for this
[1:44:24] day
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; and there were people all along and the
[1:44:29] real gift they had is that they were
[1:44:32] called to that word
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit hear it.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; They were called and they heard that
[1:44:39] word and they knew this is different
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; because it was speaking to a seed that
[1:44:46] was down inside. And that seed was given
[1:44:50] power by the author. The creator of the
[1:44:54] seed says, "I will turn this plant, this
[1:44:58] tree, this person into the species that
[1:45:02] I want him to be or I desire her to be."
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; And it's just that simple.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; There's people that are sitting here.
[1:45:13] You said, "Well, you know, I don't
[1:45:14] believe I'm that.
[1:45:20] And the author is saying, "Yeah, yeah,
[1:45:22] you are that
[1:45:26] you are going to do it." And you're
[1:45:28] saying, "Well, I don't think I have the
[1:45:30] strength to do it."
[1:45:32] No, he said, "You you do you will do
[1:45:34] it."
[1:45:35] Well, I didn't expect that it was going
[1:45:37] to go this direction. And the author
[1:45:39] says, "Yeah, that's correct. You didn't
[1:45:41] expect it."
[1:45:44] And you might say, I think now he's
[1:45:48] dreamed a dream. And the thing is, now
[1:45:50] here comes the scriptural punchline.
[1:45:53] Joseph was able to tell them the dream,
[1:45:58] but he wasn't able to interpret his own
[1:46:01] dream. Amen.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; He got put into prison with the butler
[1:46:06] and the baker uh the chief of the butler
[1:46:09] and the chief of the bakers of Pharaoh's
[1:46:12] uh kingdom and they had a dream and he
[1:46:16] could interpret their dream and even
[1:46:18] tell them what was going to happen.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Your head's going to be taken off you
[1:46:22] and you're going to be restored and bear
[1:46:25] the cup to Pharaoh. He could tell him
[1:46:27] all that, but he couldn't even interpret
[1:46:30] his own dream that he was he the real
[1:46:33] depth of his dream was I'm in prison and
[1:46:37] I am the type of the Messiah and one is
[1:46:40] being restored and one is being lost. He
[1:46:43] didn't say I see a cross.
[1:46:46] I see two crosses, one on each side. I
[1:46:50] see the Messiah hanging there and I am
[1:46:53] the privileged one of the earth to
[1:46:55] represent him.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Listen folks, say amen.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; And neither can you interpret
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; what is taking place
[1:47:09] because so often and I'm dealing with
[1:47:12] reality. We get the idea that things are
[1:47:16] going sideways.
[1:47:19] He had a dream that the 11 chiefs were
[1:47:22] going to bow to his chief. And in a
[1:47:25] short time, he's on a camel ride
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; with some Israelites and merchant men on
[1:47:32] his way to Egypt. He's going further
[1:47:35] away from anything that he could put
[1:47:38] together. How in the world are these
[1:47:41] brethren going to bow to him? I'm going
[1:47:44] in the opposite direction.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; So, you might as well say amen because I
[1:47:50] look in your faces and know that's
[1:47:52] exactly where you've been.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going further away from what I feel
[1:47:57] should be happening. I'm I'm headed in a
[1:48:00] This thing's going in reverse. No, it's
[1:48:03] not going in reverse.
[1:48:06] You're right on side. You're right on
[1:48:08] time. You're right in the channel. And
[1:48:11] you're going to produce Jesus Christ in
[1:48:14] his coming.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; You're going to produce. You're going to
[1:48:18] be the evidence that it was Jesus Christ
[1:48:21] standing at the platform. You're going
[1:48:23] to be the evidence that Jesus Christ
[1:48:26] spoke this message.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; And you'll have your you'll have your
[1:48:33] time. You'll sit around the table.
[1:48:37] You'll sit around the marriage table.
[1:48:40] You'll be in another body.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; You'll be greeting other saints because
[1:48:45] that's the life that's in the seed.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; So, he was going further.
[1:48:55] I've had Mike Hunt used to say to me,
[1:48:58] "Boy,
[1:48:59] never dreamed all this was going to
[1:49:01] happen.
[1:49:03] Never dreamed the message was going to
[1:49:05] go this way. never dreamed never dreamed
[1:49:07] that you know we'd go through this.
[1:49:10] No, you didn't dream we'd go through the
[1:49:14] but my announcement to you is it's right
[1:49:17] on time
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; and it's right on track
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; and as long as you are in the channel.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; As long as you're in the channel. Well,
[1:49:29] how do I know I'm in the channel? You're
[1:49:31] sitting here this morning. Your heart is
[1:49:34] open. Your spirit is open.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; You're willing. And oh God, whatever
[1:49:40] your will is,
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; you're in the channel.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; You're in the channel. God, I I have to
[1:49:47] emphasize that because I have uh
[1:49:49] hundreds of millions of devils that are
[1:49:52] on the charge to tell you you're in the
[1:49:55] wrong place. You're in the wrong
[1:49:57] channel. I'm here to tell you you're in
[1:50:00] the right channel. If you have the right
[1:50:03] attitude towards the word of God, God's
[1:50:06] going to bring things forth out of your
[1:50:08] life that you would have the least you
[1:50:10] least expected it to happen.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Just as I was leaving Hawaii,
[1:50:19] I tried to see a man the last time I was
[1:50:21] there. He was a salesman
[1:50:25] and now he's sales manager.
[1:50:28] And I sat down with him and actually he
[1:50:30] had left the office and was on his way
[1:50:32] home
[1:50:34] and I got a text and he says, "I'm here
[1:50:36] in the I'm here in the office." And so I
[1:50:38] stepped into the lobby and and I said,
[1:50:40] "Is is I called him by name. Is he
[1:50:43] here?" Another said, "John's left."
[1:50:47] I said, "I just talked to him." I said,
[1:50:49] "I I was on the I was listening to a
[1:50:52] voicemail as I walked over here. I
[1:50:54] talked to him in the last two minutes."
[1:50:57] Anyway, they called him and he came
[1:50:58] back. He said, "Well, I was on my way
[1:51:01] home. I didn't think you were coming."
[1:51:02] We sat down in the first few minutes. He
[1:51:05] says, "This world's a violent place."
[1:51:09] He says, "This, you know, this world is
[1:51:11] a violent place. This is shootings and
[1:51:13] killings." He says, "What's going on?"
[1:51:17] You know, the economy and everything is
[1:51:19] going all sideways. You know, here's a
[1:51:21] successful man, what's going on? says,
[1:51:24] "Well, you know, we got talking into it
[1:51:28] and finally he said, 'Well, you know,"
[1:51:30] he said, "I made some trips to," he
[1:51:33] said, "I made some trips to Asia, to
[1:51:35] Vietnam, and to Thailand, and to
[1:51:39] Cambodia." He says, "I'm leaving in a
[1:51:41] few days again." And he said, "I just
[1:51:42] want to do something."
[1:51:45] What are you doing? Well, I don't know.
[1:51:47] He says, "You know, I talked to my
[1:51:48] dentist and he'll go over and fill
[1:51:50] somebody's teeth and I I talked to
[1:51:52] sports outfit and they're giving me all
[1:51:54] their sweaters and he says, "I see the
[1:51:56] kids laying on the street." He said,
[1:51:57] "They're orphans." He said, "I was an
[1:51:59] orphan."
[1:52:01] That's the first time I knew that I was
[1:52:03] an orphan. He said, "I see all these
[1:52:04] kids in there laying on the street." He
[1:52:06] says, "You got to do something." I don't
[1:52:08] know. I got to do something.
[1:52:11] And that's just the way. And I was able
[1:52:14] to tell him and I just sent him. He may
[1:52:17] be listening right now.
[1:52:19] He says, "I want the I want the your
[1:52:22] address, web address so I can stream the
[1:52:26] meeting." I just sent it to him last
[1:52:29] night.
[1:52:34] So I want to say also to John,
[1:52:37] there's several hundred people here.
[1:52:39] John
[1:52:43] that have found what the real answer to
[1:52:46] life is all about.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; And I told you, John, it has to start
[1:52:53] with a new birth.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful I'm with the people that
[1:52:59] were born again
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; of another seed.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Not just the seed of your father, the
[1:53:06] sperm of your father,
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; and come from the womb of your mother.
[1:53:11] You came from the mouth of God.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the original seed.
[1:53:18] And that spoken word has the power
[1:53:21] invested in it. It will bring forth what
[1:53:24] the author said it would bring forth.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; And I want you to have a irrevocable
[1:53:31] confidence
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; that that's exactly what it is.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:53:37] Amen.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to be another few minutes
[1:53:41] and then I'm going to close.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; The dreams give no details.
[1:53:50] And even his life which interprets the
[1:53:53] dreams, he doesn't even know that
[1:53:56] remains a secret and mystery.
[1:54:00] You know why I'm speaking this way?
[1:54:02] Because you came to church this morning
[1:54:04] as a believer of this message. You came
[1:54:07] because you're invited. You came because
[1:54:09] you well I I I enjoy the fellowship or I
[1:54:12] enjoy the singing or whatever more. I'll
[1:54:14] tell you why you came. You don't even
[1:54:17] know
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; what's behind it.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; God has ordained that you need to be
[1:54:24] here perhaps to hear these very words
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; and to go away from here and said, "I
[1:54:30] didn't realize that these things could
[1:54:33] be being fulfilled. I don't have to
[1:54:36] understand it. In fact, is God has held
[1:54:38] it from me.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; He's held it as a secret. But I've been
[1:54:43] told and I am telling you on the
[1:54:45] authority of God's word, you are
[1:54:47] manifesting the coming of the Lord.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; The same as Joseph was manifesting the
[1:54:53] coming of the Lord. You have been called
[1:54:56] to manifest a certain part of his
[1:54:58] coming.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:07] He's bought by Potterer,
[1:55:09] captain of Pharaoh's guard, Joseph's
[1:55:12] made overseer of Piper's possessions.
[1:55:15] Oh, things are going good. He got a
[1:55:17] raise.
[1:55:20] He's doing well. Maybe thought now I'm
[1:55:22] in the blessings of God. He's falsely
[1:55:25] accused. Oh,
[1:55:28] something's happened.
[1:55:30] and he is he re he he refuses the
[1:55:34] enticements of this beautiful woman
[1:55:37] potterer's wife
[1:55:40] and he's cast into prison because he
[1:55:43] leaves his coat
[1:55:46] and she says this man here tried to
[1:55:48] seduce me and fact is there was nothing
[1:55:52] of the truth and so because of that he's
[1:55:54] cast into prison
[1:55:56] God doesn't deliver him out of prison
[1:55:58] right away he's in prison He needs to be
[1:56:01] in prison.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; That's part of the type.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; You might say things are going sideways.
[1:56:09] They need to go sideways.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Things are going in reverse.
[1:56:16] They need to go in reverse. God is doing
[1:56:19] something when things are going sideways
[1:56:22] that he can't do when you're on the
[1:56:24] mountaintop.
[1:56:30] There has to be a dungeon. And God kept
[1:56:33] it from him. God keeps it from you. You
[1:56:35] don't know why you're going through this
[1:56:37] trial. God doesn't have to explain why
[1:56:39] you're going through the trial. And God
[1:56:41] doesn't have to take you out of it until
[1:56:44] he's ready.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Say, "Amen."
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Say, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Are you brave enough to say, "Thank you
[1:56:52] for the dungeon."
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Good. It's all about 20% of the hands.
[1:56:58] But anyway,
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; you will learn things and things happen
[1:57:07] and God does not interpret. He never did
[1:57:10] get an interpretation. The
[1:57:11] interpretation of his life, listen, you
[1:57:14] didn't even know till a prophet way
[1:57:17] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:57:19] years, centuries later comes. He was
[1:57:23] loved of his father. He was hated of his
[1:57:26] brethren. He was a spiritual man. He had
[1:57:29] a coat of many colors because there were
[1:57:31] the seven colors of the rainbow. The
[1:57:34] same rainbow was over the head of the
[1:57:36] Lord Jesus. He was clothed with the
[1:57:38] covenant.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, his clothing was his
[1:57:44] covenant. He couldn't do anything
[1:57:46] outside of the word of God.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; I hope that this is carrying some impact
[1:57:53] to you. We didn't know that till now.
[1:57:56] Now the mystery of his life starts to
[1:57:58] unfold. The mystery of And furthermore,
[1:58:00] the prophet said it was Christ
[1:58:03] in Joseph.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; And now we realize, oh, isn't that
[1:58:09] wonderful? It was like Christ in Joseph.
[1:58:12] Come on, wake up, folks. It's Christ in
[1:58:14] you, the hope of glory. And that's what
[1:58:18] you should be rejoice. Well, I I I
[1:58:20] shouldn't be going through this if it's
[1:58:22] Christ in me. Who said you're not
[1:58:24] supposed to be going through it?
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; I say this, whatever you do, do it all
[1:58:32] in the name and for the glory of God.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; I have a good job. Praise the Lord.
[1:58:37] Thank him for it. I'm going through a
[1:58:39] difficult time. Praise the Lord. You
[1:58:42] thank him for it. I've got decisions.
[1:58:44] That's fine. We all have decisions. And
[1:58:47] the prophet said, "Sometimes the prophet
[1:58:49] even makes a wrong decision."
[1:58:51] He says they said God doesn't show a
[1:58:54] prophet everything
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; and you have to make decisions on your
[1:58:57] own. Should I do this? Shouldn't I do
[1:58:59] that? Sometimes we just have to weigh
[1:59:01] things out
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; and say this. Here's the key. Another
[1:59:10] key. But whatever I do,
[1:59:15] whatever trade I learn,
[1:59:18] whatever skills I achieve,
[1:59:22] all will be done with the intent of
[1:59:25] blessing the people of God.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; I am here to serve the body of Jesus
[1:59:36] Christ. And you shall never never be
[1:59:40] disappointed with that attitude.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Just another couple of minutes, please.
[1:59:47] Pharaoh dreamed a dream. Then
[1:59:49] now Pharaoh dreamed a dream.
[1:59:52] And in his dream,
[1:59:55] and I want you to catch this very
[1:59:56] closely now, he stood by a river, and
[1:59:59] out of the river came seven fat cattle,
[2:00:03] and they fed in a meadow.
[2:00:06] And then he dreamed immediately another
[2:00:08] dream and he saw seven
[2:00:11] poor cattle, skinny ones, come out and
[2:00:14] stand beside the others.
[2:00:17] And he, that was the first dream. The
[2:00:19] second dream, he dreamed of seven ears
[2:00:21] of corn, beautiful corn.
[2:00:25] And then he saw seven bad ears of corn,
[2:00:28] withered and
[2:00:30] blasted and bad.
[2:00:34] And he dreamed it. And he called all of
[2:00:35] his wise men and his magicians and said,
[2:00:37] "What is this dream?" And they couldn't
[2:00:40] interpret the dreams. And then that
[2:00:42] butler, the butler had forgotten and he
[2:00:46] had made a promise. And Joseph said,
[2:00:49] "Now I've told you your dreams. When you
[2:00:52] get out, remember me."
[2:00:57] That's you.
[2:00:59] Deliver me out of this dungeon.
[2:01:02] I've been here by a false accusation.
[2:01:05] It never happened.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Nothing could be further from the truth.
[2:01:10] Pray that I'll be delivered out of this
[2:01:12] dungeon.
[2:01:14] And the butler forgets.
[2:01:16] Do you know why he forgot? God wanted
[2:01:19] him to forget
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; until the appropriate moment.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; So what kind of God is this? This is the
[2:01:26] God that makes no errors.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? congregation, the
[2:01:32] balcony. You believe that? He makes no
[2:01:35] errors. Every judgment is absolutely
[2:01:38] correct. And the butler forgets him
[2:01:41] until this moment arrives. And then, ah,
[2:01:45] I remember now when I was in prison, the
[2:01:48] Hebrew down there, he interpreted my
[2:01:50] dream and told me that I would be here
[2:01:52] and lift up the cuff again to you. He
[2:01:54] says, "Go and get him."
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; So, his whiskers must have been out. The
[2:01:59] Bible says he shaved, washed, cleaned
[2:02:02] his clothes, and came and stood and
[2:02:04] heard these he heard these dreams.
[2:02:09] And Joseph tells him,
[2:02:12] "There's a God that can interpret these
[2:02:15] dreams.
[2:02:17] That's all he knows. There's a God
[2:02:19] that'll interpret these dreams." So, he
[2:02:22] interprets.
[2:02:23] He interprets. Get this now, please.
[2:02:26] He's standing there interpreting
[2:02:29] Pharaoh's dreams, but he can't even
[2:02:32] interpret his own.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; He can't interpret his own vision. He
[2:02:38] doesn't know this. Now, I've been lifted
[2:02:40] up out of the prison and here's the
[2:02:43] here's the one fellow who got restored
[2:02:47] and I am I
[2:02:51] this is the greatest thing. I am
[2:02:53] representative of the Messiah in the
[2:02:56] greatest week in all of history.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; But he's missing it.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; He's missing it.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Listen, folks. It's either true or it's
[2:03:08] not true.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; We're not here for a picnic.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; There's going to be some people Some
[2:03:13] people are actually going to walk with
[2:03:15] the resurrected.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; It's never happened before. They're
[2:03:22] going to actually walk with the dead in
[2:03:24] Christ that have risen.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be there?
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to experience that?
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; You talk about the greatest week in all
[2:03:34] history, brother Daniel.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; I'm beside myself.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; I want to be there.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; You want to walk with them? what it be
[2:03:46] like to have one of them come up right
[2:03:48] beside you and you say, "Man, had the
[2:03:51] hardest week. Has been the crulest time.
[2:03:56] I feel so far from God." In fact is I
[2:03:59] think that everything's gone not only
[2:04:01] sideways, I think everything's going
[2:04:03] totally backwards in this message. I
[2:04:06] can't understand it.
[2:04:09] I think I'll go fishing. I'll go back to
[2:04:12] my job.
[2:04:14] I'm done with this. I'm going to throw
[2:04:17] in the towel. And somebody just walks up
[2:04:20] beside you. Stand up here, Tim.
[2:04:24] How are things going? Say, well, you
[2:04:27] said good, but you got to say bad.
[2:04:32] Everything's going the wrong way. Yeah.
[2:04:34] Terrible.
[2:04:36] Have you had some disappointments?
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. Terrible.
[2:04:42] And it's the greatest week. Do you know
[2:04:44] what?
[2:04:45] I'm almost resurrected,
[2:04:51] but one day we'll walk along like this.
[2:04:53] I I I I want to go with you in the
[2:04:55] rapture. But just in case, expect me to
[2:04:57] come along on your shoulder
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; and they're walking along. And brother
[2:05:03] Brandaman, Christ is the mystery of God
[2:05:05] revealed, which is talking there about
[2:05:07] the seventh seal and the coming and the
[2:05:09] secret mystery of his coming. And I wish
[2:05:11] I had time to go into it. I have in my
[2:05:13] notes, but I haven't got time. But then
[2:05:15] he comes right into the two men on the
[2:05:17] way to Emmas. Why? Because that's part
[2:05:20] of the mystery.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; And they didn't realize, but they were
[2:05:25] interpreting the scripture. Here we are
[2:05:27] preaching above them. They weren't
[2:05:29] preaching. They weren't rejoicing. They
[2:05:31] weren't happy. They were sad. And we're
[2:05:34] rejoicing because they had a sad time.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; We're rejoicing because they thought
[2:05:39] everything fell apart. And here we are
[2:05:41] up at this end knowing that it was the
[2:05:43] conclusion of the most glorious moment
[2:05:46] [Applause]
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; friends. This is a reality.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; This is true
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; and you can't interpret what's happening
[2:05:57] in your life. You just cannot interpret
[2:05:59] it. But it is God himself that's
[2:06:02] interpreting it. And things go this way,
[2:06:04] they go that way. They go every
[2:06:06] direction. But don't try to interpret it
[2:06:08] yourself. It's God who's put the power
[2:06:12] and the potentials in the seed to bring
[2:06:15] forth what he desires at this time in
[2:06:19] this season.
[2:06:21] I have to close because I said I would
[2:06:23] close,
[2:06:25] but I would like to I'd like to even say
[2:06:29] more.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; I was ready to get into a closet, too,
[2:06:36] and thank God for Joseph.
[2:06:40] how he just stayed so true,
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; how he represented the first coming of
[2:06:46] Jesus and the second coming. And he
[2:06:49] represented a time that you and I are
[2:06:51] chosen. I'm saying this, friends,
[2:06:54] because I sincerely do not believe that
[2:06:57] we grasp
[2:07:00] really what this message is all about.
[2:07:04] But you stay in that channel.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; I'm glad you're all here. I'm looking at
[2:07:09] different ones and I'm rejoicing in my
[2:07:11] heart that you're here. Thankful you're
[2:07:14] here, Brother Jim. Not out driving.
[2:07:17] Thankful that the school teachers are
[2:07:19] here. I've been yearning in my heart
[2:07:22] that I be able to say this to you.
[2:07:27] You're God's gift.
[2:07:30] You might not feel every day, well, I'm
[2:07:33] fulfilling thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:07:36] But the segments in your life and you
[2:07:40] may not notice just when you say a
[2:07:41] certain thing,
[2:07:46] Brother Terry, Mr. Tatch,
[2:07:48] you just say something to the students.
[2:07:52] You just say something.
[2:07:55] This man is saying something to me,
[2:07:57] Brother Randy Snow, and he's saying, "I
[2:07:59] just want to do something.
[2:08:02] I don't know what to do. I want to do
[2:08:05] something.
[2:08:06] He said, "There's men that want to I
[2:08:08] know all kinds of wealthy men." He said
[2:08:10] they and they're ready to do something.
[2:08:12] I've talked to them, but he has no plan,
[2:08:14] no program. He doesn't know where to go.
[2:08:18] Thought I got to put him in touch.
[2:08:21] You might think, "I'm so insignificant.
[2:08:22] I'm so simple. I'm I'm so
[2:08:24] insignificant."
[2:08:28] You could be the boy with the lunch
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; and the loaves and the fishes and be put
[2:08:34] in the Bible.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; I saw you young people at the thing at
[2:08:39] the school the other night and I'm so
[2:08:42] moved.
[2:08:43] I'm so thankful
[2:08:46] we can have that kind of an atmosphere.
[2:08:50] I want to say to you as believers,
[2:08:53] don't ever forget this. You are called
[2:08:56] to the highest calling that a human can
[2:09:00] experience.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand with me?
[2:09:20] Dear heavenly father,
[2:09:24] this has been a sacred time for me.
[2:09:28] Begin to venture out as it were
[2:09:33] into areas of the mystery and the secret
[2:09:36] of your coming
[2:09:39] and then also to be able to bring it to
[2:09:41] the people that we are part of. We are
[2:09:44] an integral part of we are living out a
[2:09:48] part of that coming as your messenger
[2:09:51] has said. What good would it be if he
[2:09:53] came to preach if there was no one to
[2:09:55] believe it?
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; dear father by the Holy Spirit. You knew
[2:10:03] there would be people who would believe
[2:10:05] it.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; I'm with people that believe it. I'm so
[2:10:08] privileged to just walk with them and to
[2:10:11] be a part of them. I pray your blessings
[2:10:15] upon their homes in the name of Jesus
[2:10:18] Christ. I pray your blessings upon their
[2:10:21] individual lives in the name of Jesus
[2:10:24] Christ. And if they go through a
[2:10:26] hardship and difficulty, they shall go
[2:10:29] through it for the glory of Jesus Christ
[2:10:32] and for the kingdom of God. And we say,
[2:10:35] Lord, let thy kingdom come. A kingdom of
[2:10:39] righteousness, a kingdom of holiness,
[2:10:43] Lord, a kingdom that you have ordained
[2:10:45] shall come into being into place. And
[2:10:48] here we are as the people, the third
[2:10:50] Exodus people. I pray, Father, there
[2:10:53] will be a quickening within the very uh
[2:10:56] very depths of the soul of the people.
[2:10:59] May they ponder these things that have
[2:11:01] been said. I pray they will go back and
[2:11:04] read concerning Joseph and see
[2:11:06] themselves there, realizing, oh, Father,
[2:11:10] that there are certain things we do see
[2:11:12] and there are other things that we do
[2:11:14] not see, Lord. And in in the in your
[2:11:17] coming, there are things that have been
[2:11:19] spoken. They've been unsealed and we see
[2:11:23] them. We understand them. We understand
[2:11:26] that verbal interpretation
[2:11:29] as far as it takes us. But then there is
[2:11:32] that secret part which you have not made
[2:11:35] known to us. But you want us to trust
[2:11:38] you to have confidence just to believe
[2:11:41] that God who called me, he is working
[2:11:44] these things out in my life, he has
[2:11:47] ordained this for me. And I thank you
[2:11:50] for it. I thank you for the good times.
[2:11:52] I thank you for the bad times. We thank
[2:11:55] you for one another. I thank you,
[2:11:57] Father, for the people that have prayed
[2:12:00] and the people that we shake hands with
[2:12:03] and the fact that we can be together
[2:12:05] here in this place to give you praise
[2:12:07] and glory. My Jesus,
[2:12:11] I love thee.
[2:12:13] I know thou art mine. For thee all the
[2:12:16] follyies of sin I resign.
[2:12:20] My gracious redeemer, my savior, art
[2:12:22] thou, if ever I love thee. Amen.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; My Jesus is now. Thank you, Lord, for
[2:12:29] this word.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you for this treasure that we
[2:12:33] have. And I pray, Father, your Holy
[2:12:36] Spirit to abide upon all, upon the young
[2:12:39] men that will be baptized tonight. I
[2:12:41] pray, oh God, the Holy Ghost will come
[2:12:43] upon them, fill them, use them, Lord,
[2:12:47] point their life in a direction, Lord.
[2:12:51] And may this be an evening that they
[2:12:53] will never forget the word that our
[2:12:54] brother Tim Dodd will preach tonight. I
[2:12:57] pray, oh God, that the sheep will not
[2:12:59] only be fed, but built up and benefited.
[2:13:01] And may the Holy Ghost come in behind
[2:13:04] with signs and wonders following the the
[2:13:08] supernatural accompany your word.
[2:13:10] Father, in the name of Jesus, we ask it.
[2:13:13] Amen. I wonder if we could have a song.
[2:13:19] Uh
[2:13:25] perhaps we could sing that verse. My
[2:13:27] Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art
[2:13:29] mine.
[2:13:36] Lift it up now as we sing it.
[2:13:43] My heart.
[2:13:50] [Applause]
[2:13:54] For the
[2:13:57] glory,
[2:14:00] all savior

[2:14:14] my savior.

[2:14:25] I love
[2:14:28] thee, my Jesus
[2:14:32] is now.

[2:14:38] the

[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; How many here remember brother Amy
[2:18:29] Mulan?
[2:18:30] Raise your hand.
[2:18:33] Many. How many don't know him in this
[2:18:36] place? more don't know him. This was one
[2:18:39] of Amy's favorite songs.
[2:18:43] And my heart is so touched.
[2:18:46] That last verse was him. Like a lost
[2:18:49] lamb I was drifting.
[2:18:52] He was a Catholic.
[2:18:55] He was an alcoholic.
[2:18:58] He tried everything. His family gave up
[2:19:01] on him.
[2:19:03] Don't want nothing more to do with him.
[2:19:06] He was hopeless, a hopeless alcoholic.
[2:19:10] His brother told him about this message.
[2:19:13] He came to the log church.
[2:19:16] He told me
[2:19:19] he was delivered instantly.
[2:19:22] He called his mom over in Vancouver
[2:19:24] Island and said, "I'm delivered. I'm
[2:19:27] free." She said, "Oh." Said, "Don't I've
[2:19:30] heard that before. Don't don't talk to
[2:19:32] me about it." He came to me
[2:19:35] He's like Joseph. He was down in the
[2:19:37] pit. He said, "They don't believe me.
[2:19:40] They don't believe anything. I don't
[2:19:42] have any confidence. What should I do?"
[2:19:44] I said, "Call her in 6 months."
[2:19:47] Okay. In 6 months, he called, "Mom, I'm
[2:19:51] still here. Still me. I'm still
[2:19:54] delivered. I'm still saved." Ah, she
[2:19:56] said, "I don't want to have anything to
[2:19:57] do with it." He said, "What' I do?" He
[2:20:00] come back. He now he's really
[2:20:01] discouraged. I said, "Wait a year." A
[2:20:04] year went by. They still didn't want to.
[2:20:07] Now they're finally having to come
[2:20:09] around. There's something to it. He
[2:20:10] said, "Brother, brother Ed, when I came
[2:20:12] to this message," he says, "Things raced
[2:20:15] through my mind and I could find I could
[2:20:17] find all kinds of things wrong with it."
[2:20:21] But he said, "I knew one thing. This was
[2:20:24] the only thing that delivered me."
[2:20:30] He's crossed over.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Mike,
[2:20:35] [Music]
[2:20:36] probably sister Cindy,
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Amy, shaking hands,
[2:20:41] waiting for us.
[2:20:44] Kids,
[2:20:46] you might be 8, 10, 12.
[2:20:50] You're going to be about 20
[2:20:54] just like that.
[2:20:56] How can that be? Just the same as you
[2:20:58] get older.
[2:21:00] You get older without even I'm getting
[2:21:02] older. I don't want to get any older.
[2:21:05] You're young. You want to get to a
[2:21:07] certain point. You say, "I want to be
[2:21:08] 16. I want to be 21." Yeah. Yeah. Tell
[2:21:11] me when you're 21. Come and tell me
[2:21:13] about it.
[2:21:15] How many here wish they were going the
[2:21:17] other direction?
[2:21:19] Look how many want to be younger. See
[2:21:21] there? Is that We're a mixed up crowd.
[2:21:24] Some want to be younger, some want to be
[2:21:25] older. We're not. And all I can say is
[2:21:27] thank God. Forget about that. Thank God
[2:21:30] you got a seed in you. Thank God you're
[2:21:33] going to be part of the interpretation
[2:21:36] of the resurrection. Part of the
[2:21:39] interpretation of the change of this
[2:21:42] body. I'm a candidate.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:21:46] For brother Amy. Let's sing it once
[2:21:49] again, would you? Like a lost lamb. I
[2:21:52] got tears going down my face because he
[2:21:54] just loved that so much. He just loved
[2:21:57] that. He's a great friend. Became a
[2:22:00] great friend.

[2:23:45] shake hands with somebody next to you
[2:23:47] and say, "See you on the other side."
[2:23:51] If we don't see it tonight, we'll see
[2:23:52] you on the other side.
