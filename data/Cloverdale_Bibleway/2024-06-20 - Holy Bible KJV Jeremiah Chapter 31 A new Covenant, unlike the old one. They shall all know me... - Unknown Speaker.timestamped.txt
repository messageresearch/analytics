[0:00] the book of The Prophet Jeremiah chapter
[0:03] 31 at the same time saith the Lord will
[0:07] I be the God of all the families of
[0:09] Israel and they shall be my people thus
[0:11] saith the Lord the people which were
[0:14] left of the sword found Grace in the
[0:16] wilderness even Israel when I went to
[0:18] cause him to rest the Lord hath appeared
[0:21] of old unto me saying yay I have loved
[0:24] thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore
[0:27] with loving kindness have I drawn thee
[0:29] again and I will build thee and thou
[0:31] shalt be built oh Virgin of Israel Thou
[0:34] shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets
[0:37] and shalt go forth in the dances of them
[0:39] that make Mary Thou shalt yet plant
[0:42] vines upon the mountains of Samaria the
[0:44] Planters shall plant and shall eat them
[0:46] as common things for there shall be a
[0:49] day that the Watchmen upon the Mount
[0:51] Ephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go
[0:54] up to Zion unto the Lord Our God for
[0:57] thus saith the Lord sing with gladness
[1:00] for Jacob and Shout among the chief of
[1:02] the Nations publish ye praise ye and say
[1:06] oh Lord save thy people the remnant of
[1:09] Israel behold I will bring them from the
[1:12] North country and gather them from the
[1:14] coasts of the earth and with them the
[1:16] Blind and the lame the woman with child
[1:18] and her that travaileth with child
[1:20] together a great company shall return
[1:22] thither they shall come with weeping and
[1:25] with supplications will I lead them I
[1:27] will cause them to walk by the rivers of
[1:29] waters and a straight way wherein they
[1:31] shall not stumble for I am a father to
[1:34] Israel and Ephraim is my firstborn hear
[1:37] the word of the Lord oh ye nations and
[1:40] declare it in the AES a far off and say
[1:43] he that scattered Israel will gather him
[1:45] and keep him as a Shepherd doth his
[1:48] flock for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob
[1:51] and ransomed him from the hand of him
[1:52] that was stronger than he therefore they
[1:55] shall come and sing in the height of
[1:56] Zion and shall flow together to the
[1:58] goodness of the Lord for wheat and for
[2:01] wine and for oil and for the young of
[2:03] the flock and of the herd and their soul
[2:05] shall be as a watered garden and they
[2:07] shall not sorrow anymore at all then
[2:10] shall the Virgin rejoice in the dance
[2:12] both young men and old together for I
[2:15] will turn their mourning into joy and
[2:17] Will Comfort them and make them Rejoice
[2:19] from their sorrow and I will satiate the
[2:22] soul of the priests with fatness and my
[2:24] people shall be satisfied with my
[2:26] goodness saith the Lord thus saith the
[2:29] Lord a voice was heard in Rama
[2:32] lamentation and bitter weeping Rahal
[2:34] weeping for her children refused to be
[2:36] comforted for her children because they
[2:39] were not thus saith the Lord refrain thy
[2:42] voice from weeping and thine eyes from
[2:44] tears for thy Work shall be rewarded
[2:47] saith the Lord and they shall come again
[2:49] from the land of the enemy and there is
[2:51] hope in thine end saith the Lord that
[2:54] thy children shall come again to their
[2:56] own border I have surely heard Ephraim
[2:58] boning himself that thus thou Hast
[3:01] chastised Me and I was chastised as a
[3:04] bulock unaccustomed to the Yoke turn
[3:06] thou me and I shall be turned for thou
[3:09] art the Lord my God surely after that I
[3:12] was turned I repented and after that I
[3:15] was instructed I smote upon my thigh I
[3:17] was ashamed yay even confounded because
[3:21] I did Bear the reproach of my youth is
[3:24] Ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant
[3:27] child for since I spake against him I do
[3:30] earnestly remember him still therefore
[3:32] my bowels are troubled for him I will
[3:34] surely have mercy upon Him saith the
[3:37] Lord set the up way marks make thee High
[3:40] heaps set thine heart toward the highway
[3:43] even the way which thou wantest turn
[3:45] again oh Virgin of Israel turn again to
[3:48] these thy cities how long wilt thou go
[3:51] about oh thou backsliding daughter for
[3:53] the Lord hath created a new thing in the
[3:55] earth a woman shall Compass a man thus
[3:58] saith the Lord of hosts the god of
[4:01] Israel as yet they shall use this speech
[4:03] in the land of Judah and in the cities
[4:05] thereof when I shall bring again their
[4:07] captivity the Lord bless thee Oh
[4:10] habitation of justice and mountain of
[4:12] Holiness and there shall dwell in Judah
[4:14] itself and in all the cities thereof
[4:17] together husbandmen and they that go
[4:19] forth with flocks for I have satiated
[4:22] the weary soul and I have replenished
[4:24] every sorrowful Soul upon this I awake
[4:27] and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto
[4:30] me behold the days come saith the Lord
[4:34] that I will sow the house of Israel and
[4:36] the house of Judah with the seed of man
[4:38] and with the seed of Beast and it shall
[4:40] come to pass that like as I have watched
[4:43] over them to pluck up and to break down
[4:46] and to throw down and to destroy and to
[4:49] afflict so will I watch over them to
[4:51] build and to plant saith the Lord in
[4:55] those days they shall say no more the
[4:57] fathers have eaten a sour grape and the
[4:59] the children's teeth are set on edge but
[5:02] everyone shall die for his own iniquity
[5:04] every man that eateth the sour grape his
[5:07] teeth shall be set on edge behold the
[5:10] days come saith the Lord that I will
[5:12] make a New Covenant with the house of
[5:14] Israel and with the house of Judah not
[5:17] according to the Covenant that I made
[5:18] with their fathers in the day that I
[5:20] took them by the hand to bring them out
[5:22] of the land of Egypt which my Covenant
[5:24] they break although I was in husband
[5:26] unto them saeth the Lord but this shall
[5:29] be the Covenant that I will make with
[5:31] the house of Israel after those days
[5:33] saith the Lord I will put my law in
[5:36] their inward parts and write it in their
[5:38] hearts and will be their God and they
[5:40] shall be my people and they shall teach
[5:42] no more every man his neighbor and every
[5:44] man his brother saying know the Lord for
[5:48] they shall all know me from the least of
[5:50] them unto the greatest of them saith the
[5:52] Lord for I will forgive their iniquity
[5:55] and I will remember their sin no more
[5:57] thus saith the Lord which giveth the Sun
[6:00] for a light by day and the ordinances of
[6:02] the Moon and of the stars for a light by
[6:04] night which divideth the sea when the
[6:06] waves thereof Roar the Lord of hosts is
[6:09] his name if those ordinances depart from
[6:12] before me saith the Lord then the seed
[6:14] of Israel also shall cease from being a
[6:17] nation before me forever thus saith the
[6:19] Lord If Heaven above can be measured and
[6:22] the foundations of the earth searched
[6:24] out beneath I will also cast off all the
[6:26] seed of Israel for all that they have
[6:28] done say the Lord behold the days come
[6:32] saeth the Lord that the city shall be
[6:35] built to the Lord from the Tower of
[6:36] Hanan unto the Gate of the corner and
[6:39] the measuring line shall yet go forth
[6:41] over against it upon the hill Gareb and
[6:44] shall Compass about to goth and the
[6:46] whole valley of the dead bodies and of
[6:48] the ashes and all the fields unto the
[6:50] brook of kedron Unto the corner of the
[6:52] horse gate toward the East shall be holy
[6:55] unto the Lord it shall not be plucked up
[6:58] nor thrown down anymore forever
