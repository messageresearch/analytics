[0:00] And maybe we could try singing this
[0:02] song, Sister Linda. I don't think we've
[0:03] sung it in a long time, but those of you
[0:04] in the choir know it. Jesus, I love you.
[0:10] Jesus, I love you. Let's stand together
[0:14] and worship him because you care.
[0:18] Lord, you care. I couldn't imagine,
[0:24] no Lord, you were there.
[0:28] [Applause]
[0:29] Oh Jesus, I love you.
[0:34] Oh,
[0:36] because you care.
[0:41] I couldn't imagine.
[0:44] Oh Lord,
[0:46] you weren't there.
[0:48] Jesus, I love you. Jesus, I love you.
[0:56] Oh, because you came.
[0:59] [Applause]

[1:04] Oh,

[1:31] you. Jesus, I love you.
[1:37] Oh, because you came.

[1:46] Oh Lord, if you were there,
[1:52] oh Jesus, I love you.
[1:56] Lord,
[1:58] because you care.
[2:02] I couldn't imagine
[2:06] [Music]
[2:08] you were there.
[2:11] [Music]
[2:14] Amen.
[2:16] I think the choir is going to have to do
[2:17] that one again. Amen. Don't you love him
[2:19] this morning? And I was thinking as I
[2:21] walked into this service this morning,
[2:23] victory in Jesus, my savior forever.
[2:26] It's number 777,
[2:29] the books on the screen.
[2:33] Amen. Aren't you glad you got the
[2:34] victory this morning? Amen. It's through
[2:38] the word of God. And that's why we're
[2:39] here this morning, to hear his word.
[2:42] And man, David said, "Thy word have I
[2:44] hid in my heart that I might not sin
[2:46] against you." Let's just sing this song
[2:48] this morning.
[2:50] It's an old story, but it's still true.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; Well, I heard an old old story. How
[3:00] savior came from glory.
[3:03] How we gave his life on Calary to save a
[3:08] race like me and I
[3:15] preent
[3:19] [Music]
[3:21] my sins and I want the victory.
[3:25] Oh my
[3:28] Jesus my savior

[3:37] with his redee
[3:44] [Music]
[3:49] my feet to victory
[3:53] the cleansing
[3:55] And I heard about his healing of his
[4:00] cleansing powering
[4:03] how he made the l
[4:07] and cause the mind to see.
[4:10] And then I cry Jesus come and heal my
[4:15] broken spirit. Then somehow Jesus came
[4:20] and he brought me the victory. Glory
[4:25] of victory.

[17:17] [Music]
[17:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask our brother John
[17:20] Andy's, brother John, if you'd come and
[17:21] open the service in a word of prayer.
[17:24] There's a testimony from Sister Elena.
[17:28] Uh she wants to thank the Lord for
[17:30] getting my green card and being able to
[17:32] cross the border. Thank everyone for
[17:34] their prayers. U we want to remember
[17:38] this morning's a request from brother
[17:39] Hugh that we remember a former coworker
[17:42] Mike Craraver. He's living in the
[17:43] states. He has cancer of the spine. Is
[17:45] in a lot of pain. He's thankful for the
[17:48] prayers of the saints. I want to
[17:49] remember him this morning. and also
[17:51] brother Ernie's uh away in Minnesota
[17:54] having meetings. Want to remember him
[17:55] this morning. If you've got a need, you
[17:57] just lift before the Lord. He's here
[17:59] this morning, saints. If you got a need,
[18:00] just take it to him this morning. If
[18:02] you're listening in on the internet, our
[18:04] God can meet your needs. John,
[18:10] oh Jesus,
[18:14] we just find ourselves at your feet
[18:18] feeling like that lady. Lord that saw
[18:21] the world and saw the mockers not having
[18:24] no time for you and she fell at your
[18:28] feet with her tears.
[18:30] This morning we have tears of
[18:32] thanksgiving and gratefulness because of
[18:36] all that you have done for us. If each
[18:39] worshipper could just take a step into
[18:42] their heart and
[18:44] give back to you what you deserve,
[18:46] surely this congregation would erupt. It
[18:50] would erupt. Our mouths couldn't
[18:52] wouldn't be able to contain the glory
[18:54] that you deserve. You deserve so much
[18:58] more. A thousand tongues, a thousand
[19:01] lives, Lord.
[19:03] Lord, our services are not to be a
[19:05] one-way street to where you give and you
[19:08] minister and you pour in, but we are
[19:10] here to worship. We are here to give. We
[19:14] are here to love. We are here to
[19:16] communicate back and express ourselves.
[19:20] And let us not be silent. Let us not be
[19:24] distracted, but let our attention be at
[19:26] the feet of our savior.
[19:29] We love you this morning, Jesus, more
[19:31] than anything in this world. And we want
[19:34] our hearts to be clean and right. As in
[19:37] your presence, Lord, everything of this
[19:40] world just fades away. All of the
[19:42] darkness, all of the remorse, all of the
[19:45] selfishness.
[19:46] Oh, Father, let your Holy Spirit come
[19:49] breaking through into every situation,
[19:52] into every mind, into every soul, into
[19:56] every need right now. Lord, this is not
[19:59] a gospel of just 2,000 years ago or even
[20:02] 40 years ago, but you are in the
[20:04] building this morning. You are the
[20:07] healer, and we are here as your children
[20:10] to be healed of our infirmities.
[20:13] Deliver us, oh God, as you pass by this
[20:16] way, those that are bound and crippled
[20:18] spiritually, let them reach out and
[20:20] touch the Lord. You are so near, Lord.
[20:24] You are so present. You inhabit the
[20:26] praises of your people. So Lord, we
[20:29] praise your holy name. We enter into
[20:32] your victory, oh God. You have been
[20:34] victorious in this generation. Every
[20:37] shackle, every dark cloud, every bondage
[20:41] you have broken through. And for that we
[20:44] give you glory. You are not bound to our
[20:46] culture. You are not bound to our
[20:49] countries of origin. You are the God
[20:52] that is above all things and you fill
[20:54] all things. Fill these hearts of ours,
[20:58] oh God.
[21:00] Fill these hearts.
[21:04] Fill these souls, oh Jesus. We magnify
[21:07] your word, Lord. Every syllable, every
[21:11] line. What an opportunity to be in your
[21:14] house today. That we can unbburden
[21:17] ourselves at your presence and know that
[21:20] you know all things even before we ask
[21:24] and you're much more willing to give
[21:26] than we are to receive.
[21:28] So would you pour in your Holy Spirit,
[21:30] Lord? Hands are lifted up needing a
[21:33] touch. Unspoken requests that's needed.
[21:36] Our brother Hugh has written in and
[21:37] others Lord are traveling on the field.
[21:41] physical needs, financial needs,
[21:43] direction,
[21:45] your presence to come through your word
[21:48] and minister a life that is more than
[21:50] our natural life. But we pray for them.
[21:54] Our brother Tony going to Brazil, our
[21:56] brother Ernie in Minnesota, our brother
[21:58] Timothy in Vietnam.
[22:00] So many laborers. Lord, I pray that you
[22:03] would anoint them today and anoint the
[22:06] service. Oh God, there are laborers in
[22:08] this service that are laboring for our
[22:09] good. musicians and sound and video and
[22:13] deacons and our ministry that will be
[22:16] coming. Lord Jesus, we appreciate these
[22:18] things. We appreciate the brother that's
[22:21] next to us, the sister that's next to
[22:23] us, our children, the older ones, the
[22:25] younger ones, one body, one faith, one
[22:28] word. So would you be glorified today
[22:32] that no flesh would glory but you would
[22:34] come down sovereignly
[22:37] and deal in every situation and every
[22:40] issue God withholding nothing that you
[22:44] would just pour it in so much that we
[22:46] wouldn't be able to contain it Lord and
[22:49] go beyond our expectation. If we ask for
[22:52] you to fill us Lord and you answer that
[22:55] prayer we should be happy when you start
[22:58] pouring yourself in. by your word and by
[23:00] your spirit just vindicating it. Oh God,
[23:03] those on the internet and phone hookup
[23:05] bless them. Touch our lives today. May
[23:09] your spirit continue to deal mightily in
[23:12] our lives and we'll give you glory and
[23:14] praise and honor for we love you, Jesus.
[23:18] And we thank you already.
[23:21] Amen.
[23:24] [Music]
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen Lord Jesus. Amen. You can have your
[23:28] seats.
[23:34] [Music]
[23:41] &gt;&gt; And we want to welcome everyone that's
[23:43] visiting with us today. We're happy to
[23:44] have you here with us and uh trust that
[23:47] you'll receive from God's hand today.
[23:50] Our brother Jonathan Waldner has a song.
[23:51] Brother Jonathan, if you could come and
[23:53] get ready at this time. Um, we want to,
[23:57] uh, make a special welcome to, uh,
[24:00] Brother Nathaniel Iverson's parents, uh,
[24:03] Brother Hank, Sister Danielle Iverson.
[24:06] Also, u, Brother Nathaniel's sister,
[24:08] Esther, and her daughter, Lee, are here
[24:11] with us. May we get them to stand so
[24:13] everybody knows who you are. They're
[24:14] going to be here fellowshipping with us
[24:16] for a while. God bless you. Happy to
[24:17] have you here.
[24:21] and uh any others that are visiting with
[24:23] us, we want to make sure you know you're
[24:24] real welcome. Um also uh there will be a
[24:29] young people's service this Friday,
[24:31] December the 8th at 7:30 here at the
[24:35] church. So uh I know some of the young
[24:37] people were wondering about it and uh
[24:40] there will be a service this Wednesday,
[24:41] December the 8th.
[24:45] Amen.
[24:47] You love the Lord.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. just uh wonderful what he's doing
[24:53] and uh
[24:56] sometimes the situation he gets
[24:57] situations he's get gets us into and uh
[25:00] we don't know exactly why we're there.
[25:02] Pray for me. I've got a couple of
[25:04] interesting situations I'm going to be
[25:06] in this week and uh I just need the
[25:09] Lord's help. Amen. Because I don't know
[25:11] why I'm in them. So, but he does. So,
[25:15] Lord bless you, brother Jonathan.
[25:17] This is a little song I wrote called uh
[25:19] why don't you thank him? Uh just talks
[25:22] about uh why we give him thanks during
[25:25] hard times. You know we give him thanks
[25:27] in good times and bad. So sometimes you
[25:30] go through a hard time and you just you
[25:31] just want to thank him anyway. So
[25:34] uh the tempo at home was getting a
[25:36] little quick but I'll try to keep it
[25:38] slower. Slow down. Just tends to get
[25:40] away on you this one. All right.
[25:48] [Music]
[26:02] As the days go by, you're tired and
[26:05] you're weary.
[26:07] Seems like you can't find peace and
[26:09] quiet anymore.
[26:11] I sure don't think you'll find it in
[26:14] this world that's passing by. But I know
[26:16] you'll find it on the other side.
[26:20] Why don't you thank him for what he's
[26:22] done and what he's going to do? Why
[26:24] don't you stand for him and give your
[26:26] best? Because he'll stand for you. Why
[26:29] don't you give your all the way he did
[26:31] for you on Calvary?
[26:34] Why don't you thank him for what he's
[26:36] done for you?
[26:52] [Music]
[26:58] You strive and work so hard to make ends
[27:01] meet.
[27:02] Seems like you're always running for the
[27:05] next thing. I think it's time to quiet
[27:08] down and rest your weary feet. Just
[27:11] realize he's provided what you need. Why
[27:14] don't you thank him for what he's done
[27:16] and what he's going to do? Why don't you
[27:19] stand for him and give your best because
[27:21] he'll stand for you? Why don't you give
[27:23] your all the way he did for you on
[27:25] Calvary?
[27:27] Why don't you thank him for what he's
[27:29] done for you? Why don't you thank him
[27:32] for what he's done and what he's going
[27:34] to do? Why don't you stand for him and
[27:37] give your best because you'll stand for
[27:39] you? Why don't you give your all the way
[27:41] he did you on Calvary?
[27:44] Why don't you thank him for what he's
[27:46] done for you? Why don't you thank him
[27:49] for what he's done for you?
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Jonathan.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate some of the songs
[28:04] that Brother Jonathan's written. Amen.
[28:08] We should thank him every minute of the
[28:10] day. Amen.
[28:12] Certainly. I just Well, I know I'd be
[28:15] really messed up if I didn't have the
[28:17] Lord.

[28:21] would be in the same boat. Amen. And we
[28:24] just want him to lead us and guide us
[28:26] every day of our lives. Amen. Because
[28:29] you know if he does, that's where you're
[28:30] going to be the happiest. Amen.
[28:32] Praise God. I just want more of him.
[28:35] We're going to turn to the word now as
[28:37] brother Biscll comes. Let's sing that
[28:40] little song we uh we sang a couple of
[28:43] weeks ago. More of you
[28:46] and less of me. Amen. That's what our
[28:50] prayer should be. Amen. This flesh just
[28:53] gets in the way. Amen. We want more of
[28:55] him. Amen. We want him to take over.
[28:58] Amen. and then we'll be able to manifest
[29:01] his perfect will in our lives. Let's
[29:03] sing it together. Amen.
[29:06] More
[29:08] of you
[29:12] and less
[29:14] of me.
[29:18] Oh Lord, I pray that there might be
[29:25] more of you and less of me.
[29:31] Oh, I want more
[29:34] of you. That's my prayer, Lord. last
[29:41] me.
[29:44] Oh Lord, I pray that there might be
[29:51] more of you and less of me.
[29:57] Like the grain of wheat that falls to
[30:02] the earth and dies to live a new.
[30:10] All my plans and earthly desires
[30:15] I lay them down to follow you.
[30:21] Oh, I want more.
[30:26] Lord
[30:28] and let
[30:30] us
[30:34] [Music]
[30:36] pray and bear my dream.
[30:40] More of you and less of me.
[30:46] I want more
[30:51] of you and as
[30:58] oh Lord I pray that there might be
[31:05] more of you and less of me like a grain
[31:11] like a grain of wheat that falls to the
[31:16] earth and dies to live a You
[31:23] all
[31:24] my plans and earthly lives. I live now
[31:31] to follow you.
[31:39] You
[31:43] are
[31:48] God. How great and care
[31:53] for you and
[31:57] me.
[32:01] [Music]
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Nice to see you all here.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Full of expectation.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:16] We got victory over the snow.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Good.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; We're so happy it snowed us in last
[32:23] week.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; We got snowed into the church and we
[32:26] couldn't couldn't leave so we just let
[32:29] the preacher preach.
[32:32] We enjoyed the meetings immensely.
[32:35] Our brother Timuit,
[32:37] he enjoyed being here with you also. It
[32:40] was a wonderful spirit.
[32:43] It was just the Lord. It was just just
[32:45] the right time, the right word, the
[32:49] right servant.
[32:51] Everything was perfect.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; I thought just perfect. The Lord just
[32:56] thought, you know, uh this is going to
[32:59] be special. So, I'll just allow the
[33:01] clouds to dump snow down. And so, you
[33:05] know, you know what that does? We we
[33:08] didn't have anything else in our mind.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; We weren't worried about running off
[33:12] home for dinner. We didn't know if we
[33:15] could get home.
[33:18] Didn't know if we could go any place.
[33:20] So, we just stayed here. Uh that was
[33:22] wonderful.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; That was really special.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; And uh you know, it just created a whole
[33:28] atmosphere. Actually changed the
[33:30] atmosphere in the congregation. I sensed
[33:33] it right away. Hey, we have nothing
[33:35] better to do. Really? Really, we had
[33:38] nothing better to do. I know we can say
[33:40] that, but you know when everything's
[33:41] nice and the sun is shining and you know
[33:43] you want to get out and you got plans
[33:46] and all the rest of it. God doesn't
[33:47] really want that on the Lord's day. He
[33:50] just likes us to be closed in with him.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we really feel that way
[33:55] and have that uh that sense that we are
[33:58] just clo enclosed with him in a secret
[34:01] place, then you'll find the atmosphere
[34:03] will be different. We just enjoyed it so
[34:06] so very much.
[34:09] And uh there was a lot of people that
[34:11] streamed. There was 190 locations that
[34:15] live streamed the meeting while it was
[34:16] on. And in the week from then till last
[34:19] night four 40 47
[34:23] have listened on the archives.
[34:25] So there's big a big c when brother
[34:29] brother Puit saw that he said that he
[34:32] just realized there's a big congregation
[34:35] out there that was also uh
[34:38] fellowshipping with us and that's
[34:39] wonderful.
[34:42] Uh, I know that many of you know, I
[34:44] suppose perhaps all know that our sister
[34:47] Rebecca Smith, brother Brandham's
[34:49] daughter, passed away and that her her
[34:53] viewing, they're actually having a
[34:54] viewing today in Tucson.
[34:57] And then there'll be just a family
[34:59] private family
[35:01] uh service and internment tomorrow in
[35:05] Tucson.
[35:06] So, we want to remember as a
[35:08] congregation, I know that you have
[35:10] prayed. I've I know that many of you
[35:12] wrote notes in the uh on the online
[35:16] guest book and uh we just found that
[35:20] yesterday ourselves and so we've sent
[35:23] condolences
[35:25] but let's pray for them. It be really a
[35:27] great loss to the children Angela
[35:31] William and Steven and then their
[35:33] spouses and and their family their
[35:36] children as well. So, especially Brother
[35:40] George, which most everyone here knows
[35:44] in a personal way. Brother George,
[35:45] Sister Rebecca were here for perhaps two
[35:48] or more years.
[35:50] So, we are remembering them.
[35:55] She's the first one of the children
[35:57] gathered with her father and mother on
[36:00] the other side. And I can tell you they
[36:03] have no twinge of sorrow.
[36:06] It's not possible for them to have any
[36:08] twinge of sorrow. We experience a
[36:10] heaviness but they can't have any
[36:12] heaviness. And we're we're so for that
[36:16] part we rejoice.
[36:18] We're thankful.
[36:21] I'd like you also remember if you'd
[36:23] remember myself in special prayer. Uh
[36:27] every just frequently different ones say
[36:30] well we were praying for you this
[36:32] morning. I was Matt said we prayed for
[36:34] you till end of the we hours this
[36:37] morning. Uh that for the service today
[36:40] that really is wonderful. I appreciate
[36:42] that so so very much. Uh this next
[36:46] Sunday I will be in uh Brazil with
[36:48] brother Tony. Brother Tony leaves today
[36:53] and will be there a couple days ahead.
[36:56] Uh we will be with brother Cesar. That's
[36:58] a brother who has uh he's built a a
[37:02] church there in this uh in a certain
[37:05] city up on the coast north of Rio.
[37:10] And uh he's the brother that has a he
[37:13] had the local television broadcast and
[37:16] then the congregation here, members of
[37:18] the congregation made it possible for
[37:20] him to go nationwide to all 19 provinces
[37:25] of Brazil.
[37:27] And uh so
[37:29] um he has arranged that uh he wants to
[37:33] make some some broadcasts and you that
[37:36] were here you saw some of the broadcast.
[37:38] I thought it was really remarkable. He
[37:40] standed on water for probably 45 minutes
[37:43] and preached on baptism
[37:46] and that was really remarkable. He's
[37:48] been getting letters letters. I mean
[37:50] they're they're almost inundated. This
[37:52] is where brother Tony is such an
[37:54] assistant to them because it helps them
[37:57] to set the thing up because they weren't
[38:00] aware. I asked the question and sent a
[38:04] question to him as soon as he talked
[38:06] about having this going nationwide. What
[38:09] are you going to do to the people that
[38:10] respond phone and want something want a
[38:15] you know want a want a you know a
[38:18] message book or something? What are you
[38:19] going to give them? And then that's what
[38:21] they woke up to. Now they've got several
[38:23] people working steady working full-time
[38:26] responding to these requests and
[38:29] ministers and churches and people from
[38:32] all over the country. And it's a large
[38:35] country. It's I understand the fifth
[38:37] largest country on on the planet and
[38:41] very large population.
[38:43] And so uh
[38:46] we also have assisted brother Tony spent
[38:49] a number of weeks down there and Steven
[38:51] Keer was there. uh something has
[38:54] happened in that development and that is
[38:56] that one of the the first church that
[38:59] invited me to come down and it turned
[39:02] out that brother Febiono who was here
[39:05] Februio I should say who was here and
[39:08] had a great burden for Mosmbique because
[39:10] they're Portuguese nation and also
[39:13] Angola who Portuguese
[39:17] he had such a burden for them and
[39:18] traveled over there many times and saw
[39:20] many many works established
[39:23] He had such a burden but there was no
[39:25] message book. So I said well you should
[39:27] be translating them here and then
[39:29] brother doa can print them in Africa and
[39:31] we'll do what we can to see that uh that
[39:34] the printing is is supported and paid
[39:37] for and then as soon as you people can
[39:40] get your act together here you should
[39:42] run the office you know yourselves and
[39:45] we will uh we'll step back and step out
[39:48] of the way. They said oh don't don't
[39:49] leave us. Don't leave us. Well, now
[39:51] they've stepped forward and they've
[39:53] said, "We think that we're about ready
[39:55] to take the whole work over." And and
[39:58] that is the first time first time in all
[40:00] the years that Bible believers has been
[40:02] established where we've been able to uh
[40:06] be an example to a whole nation of of
[40:10] this is what works. It works in India.
[40:13] It it's working in China and it works in
[40:16] the Philippines and it works in the
[40:17] Ukraine and it it it actually works and
[40:21] you and the people receive it's under
[40:23] the leadership of the local pastors
[40:25] which is the way it's supposed to be.
[40:28] Each church is sovereign. You brethren,
[40:31] you know what's needed in the country.
[40:32] There's nobody from somewhere else in
[40:34] the world that's telling you what to do.
[40:36] Uh that's exactly what the message
[40:38] teaches. But but something is actually
[40:40] built that is ongoing. it is uh it it it
[40:44] works, it functions, it's successful.
[40:46] And they said, "We've seen that and now
[40:48] we want to follow that pattern, but we
[40:51] need you to help us." So, we did. We've
[40:53] been helping him now for a couple of
[40:54] years. And it's and now it's just
[40:56] happened as of now. And that's one of
[40:58] the main purposes. Brother Tony will be
[41:00] there to see a transition take place to
[41:04] the local pastors to take it and assume
[41:07] full responsibility within the country.
[41:09] And I think that's wonderful. Abs
[41:11] absolutely remember to pray for them.
[41:13] It's a it's a big responsibility and
[41:15] then we will continue
[41:18] Lord willing helping the uh people in
[41:21] Mosmb beek and you know to us sitting
[41:23] here today we talk about Mosmb beek and
[41:26] Angola and the far away places but I
[41:28] guarantee you you'd have a paradigm
[41:30] shift in your minds if you just saw that
[41:34] those doors open and saw those people
[41:37] start flowing across this platform
[41:40] &gt;&gt; and if they looked down and said we we
[41:42] heard
[41:44] We heard of God sent a prophet in the
[41:46] end time. We believed, but we don't know
[41:49] what he said. We don't have any message
[41:52] books. They told us, "Oh, we'd love to."
[41:54] And they looked down into your faces and
[41:56] said, "Could you get us could you get me
[41:59] a book?"
[42:01] You'd have a paradigm shift this
[42:02] morning.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; How fast? About that fast. You'd say,
[42:06] "Brother Ed, what can we do?" And we're
[42:08] doing what we can. There's been uh when
[42:11] I spoke last brother Dioa 29 messages
[42:15] have now been printed. They've printed
[42:17] in in at Shakina publications for Mosmb
[42:21] beek and and Portuguese speaking people.
[42:24] I just say praise God.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I just want to as far as I'm
[42:28] concerned I just want to uh spend our
[42:31] lives doing that. That's our passion.
[42:34] This message is precious and we want
[42:36] others to experience it as well. And so,
[42:39] Brother Cesar, he's uh he wants to make
[42:41] about six uh TV broadcasts, three each
[42:46] day for two days, and then we have a
[42:48] meeting Saturday night, meeting Sunday.
[42:49] I'll be with them Monday, come back on
[42:51] Tuesday. So, you pray for me. I'm not as
[42:55] uh I'm not 30 anymore, even though I may
[42:57] act like it sometime, but uh anyway,
[43:00] praise the Lord.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; I would like to sing as we get ready to
[43:04] turn to the word uh 246. We are more
[43:08] than conquerors. Brother Rod, if you can
[43:10] help me with that, why don't we stand?
[43:12] We'll get ready to read the word. Also,
[43:14] I'll be reading on John the 14th chapter
[43:18] and also from Isaiah 14.
[43:26] Sing this as a reality. It's a theme of
[43:28] our service this morning.
[43:32] We've been more than coners
[43:38] over in this life.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; We've been made victorious
[43:49] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[43:53] Everyone together. We've been made more
[43:57] than coners.
[43:59] [Music]
[44:01] overcomes in this life.
[44:07] We've been made
[44:09] glorious
[44:10] [Music]
[44:12] &gt;&gt; through the blood
[44:13] &gt;&gt; through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Once more everyone,
[44:19] &gt;&gt; we've been made
[44:21] [Music]
[44:25] over in this life.
[44:30] We've been made victorious
[44:36] by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[44:41] Would you bow your heads with me into
[44:43] your hearts as well?
[44:46] Almighty God, creator of heavens and
[44:49] earth, giver of every good gift. Truly,
[44:53] you have been gracious to us. You've
[44:56] been gracious to your children. You've
[44:59] provided us with all that we've needed.
[45:03] Truly, we can say, Jehovah Gyra, the
[45:07] Lord hath provided. Not only will
[45:10] provide, but you have provided. You've
[45:13] brought us here this morning. Lord, you
[45:16] have given us strength. You've provided
[45:19] our needs. You have poured out your
[45:22] spirit. You have opened up your word.
[45:25] You have sent us your servants, oh God.
[45:28] You have sent us your message. You have
[45:30] sent us your prophet, oh God. You have
[45:33] confirmed your word. Lord, you have sent
[45:37] your presence amongst us. And Father,
[45:40] today we thank you from the very depths
[45:43] of our heart for what we sense and what
[45:46] we are experiencing at this moment for
[45:50] the light. For you truly have said, "Let
[45:52] there be light." And we can say and
[45:55] there is light. We praise your name. We
[45:59] are those Lord who have risen because
[46:03] the light has come and you have said in
[46:06] your word rise and shine for your light
[46:09] has come. We say glory to your marvelous
[46:13] name creator of light and life. And now,
[46:17] Lord, I pray that you will enlighten our
[46:20] minds and open our eyes and our
[46:22] understanding as we look into your word
[46:25] and read. And may we be profited by
[46:28] these meetings. All who are streaming
[46:31] now. Lord, pray your holy presence will
[46:34] enter into every room all over the
[46:38] globe. Oh God. Oh Lord, how wonderful it
[46:41] is that we can be linked together. And I
[46:43] pray they will feel and be one with us
[46:46] in spirit and in truth. In the name of
[46:48] Jesus Christ, I surrender myself and
[46:51] yield myself to you, Lord. Pray you'll
[46:54] bless in wonderfully the service this
[46:56] morning and this evening. Oh God, that
[46:59] your presence will be abiding with us in
[47:03] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[47:07] [Music]
[47:09] In John 14, I want to begin reading at
[47:12] the 19th verse.
[47:17] Yet a little while and the world seeth
[47:20] me no more,
[47:22] but ye see me. Because I live, you shall
[47:26] live also.
[47:28] At that day you shall know that I am in
[47:30] my father and ye in me and I in you.
[47:36] He that hath my commandments and keepeth
[47:38] them, he it is that loveth me, and he
[47:41] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[47:43] father, and I will love him, and will
[47:47] manifest myself to him. Many of you who
[47:50] had me sign your Bibles, that's the
[47:53] verse that you have in your Bible. of
[47:55] all the letters my father wrote me and
[47:59] uh uh instructed me, this is the one
[48:03] scripture that it seemed to leap off the
[48:06] pages of his letter and he gave me John
[48:10] 14 and 21. And when I read it, it seemed
[48:14] it was different from all other
[48:15] scripture for me at that time. Been my
[48:18] favorite ever since.
[48:21] Judas saith unto him, not Escariat,
[48:25] Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest
[48:28] thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
[48:32] Jesus answered and said unto him, If a
[48:36] man love me, he will keep my words,
[48:39] and my father will love him, and we will
[48:43] come unto him and make our abode with
[48:46] him.
[48:52] That's down to verse 23. And I just want
[48:55] you to notice
[48:59] uh verse
[49:03] see here
[49:07] and the 19th verse. Yes. Yet a little
[49:09] while and the world seeth me no more but
[49:12] ye see me because I live ye shall live
[49:14] also. If you'll keep that in your mind.
[49:16] And then in Isaiah 14,
[49:19] I want to read from verse 12 just down
[49:23] to 17.
[49:26] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[49:28] Lucifer, son of the morning? How art
[49:30] thou cut down to the ground which did
[49:33] weaken the nations? For thou hast said
[49:36] in thine heart, I will ascend into
[49:38] heaven. I will exalt my throne above the
[49:40] stars of God. I will sit also upon the
[49:43] mount of the congregation in the sides
[49:45] of the north. I will ascend above the
[49:48] heights of the clouds. I will be like
[49:51] the most high. Yet thou shalt be brought
[49:54] down to hell to the sides of the pit.
[49:57] They that see thee shall narrowly
[50:00] narrowly look upon thee, and consider
[50:03] thee, saying, Is this the man that made
[50:06] the earth to tremble, and the that did
[50:11] shake nations,
[50:14] that made the world as a wilderness, and
[50:17] destroyed the cities thereof, that
[50:20] opened not the house of his prisoners?
[50:24] And then I want to I would like to just
[50:26] read from
[50:29] uh Revelation please the sixth chapter
[50:33] the opening of the seals.
[50:37] And I want to read the opening of the
[50:41] third seal which is verses 5 and six.
[50:46] And when he had opened the third seal, I
[50:50] heard the third beast say, "Come and
[50:53] see." And I beheld, and lo, a black
[50:56] horse, and he that sat on him had a pair
[51:00] of balances in his hand. And I heard a
[51:03] voice in the midst of the four beasts
[51:05] say, "A measure of wheat for a penny,
[51:09] and three measures of barley for a
[51:12] penny, and see thou hurt not the oil in
[51:16] the wine." God bless his word to our
[51:18] hearts. You may be seated.
[51:25] Now I'll need your undivided attention
[51:28] as we just uh seek by God's help to
[51:32] bring these thoughts together.
[51:35] The opening or the purpose of the
[51:37] opening of the seals
[51:39] was to give us insight into the time and
[51:45] the hour that we're in. It's not just
[51:48] some mere history. That's not the
[51:51] purpose of it. It was to give us some
[51:54] insight and also knowledge of the time
[51:58] that we're living in and the conditions
[52:01] that you and I have to deal with. And
[52:03] that's what the opening of the seals are
[52:05] all about
[52:07] in our own strength. And as I read about
[52:10] now, we've we've been touching on these
[52:12] four horse riders, but in our own
[52:14] strength,
[52:16] we are no match and we are not capable
[52:22] of uh of of being able to withstand or
[52:27] to know, I would say, the tactics and
[52:30] all of the infiltration
[52:33] of Satan in our modern society.
[52:37] You go into the shopping mall, I can
[52:41] assure you he's influenced everything
[52:43] that's there. You walk onto the streets,
[52:46] you mingle with the people, if you were
[52:49] go to a sports event or if you were to
[52:52] go to a political event, I can assure
[52:54] you that this crafty, cunning enemy has
[52:59] infiltrated
[53:01] every one of those areas. And so, how
[53:03] are you going to know
[53:06] where your enemy is? How are you going
[53:09] to be able to determine? And I can
[53:11] assure you, there's no person that can
[53:14] fight a successful battle unless they
[53:17] can identify where their enemy is. It's
[53:20] a very very dangerous thing if you are a
[53:22] fighting person in a war. Uh it's it's
[53:26] an unnerving thing to have a hidden
[53:28] enemy and you can't find them and you
[53:32] don't know where they are and you have
[53:34] no knowledge of them. You have no
[53:36] knowledge of where they are. That is why
[53:39] war modern warfare today and all the
[53:42] sophistication of the weaponry which is
[53:45] being devised is to try to determine
[53:48] where the enemy is. having all kinds of
[53:52] uh uh radar gear and and uh all of the
[53:56] instrumentation to try to locate where
[54:00] that enemy is. And one of the most
[54:03] difficult things that they're having
[54:05] even today uh within Iraq is they have
[54:08] not fought this kind of a war before
[54:12] where people come even dressed as women
[54:15] or dressed as just innocent people and
[54:18] normal everyday people riding a bicycle
[54:22] or driving an automobile or whatever
[54:24] more. And then uh the the those that are
[54:27] all equipped and uh very clearly evident
[54:31] fighting men and women find themselves
[54:34] in the midst of a horrific explosion and
[54:37] every day it's happening
[54:39] &gt;&gt; because the enemy is hidden.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; At least what they call an enemy is a
[54:45] hidden enemy. Let me tell you something
[54:47] friends. It would be unlike the God that
[54:51] I know to leave his children ignorant
[54:55] and blind uh not knowing where their
[54:59] enemy is to tell them on the one hand
[55:02] this is the most cunning this is the
[55:04] most deceiving of all enemies most
[55:08] deceiving but somehow you can never find
[55:10] him. No, it would be it would be uh it
[55:14] would be incumbent upon God to pull the
[55:16] covers off and at least say to his
[55:18] children, "Here, I'm going to do two
[55:20] things. I'm going to I'm going to open
[55:22] your eyes and give you eyesight so you
[55:25] can see it see him. And number two, I'm
[55:27] going to tell you where he is."
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what the opening
[55:31] of the seals when you just hear that
[55:32] phrase, let it be known to you, it the
[55:36] the seals have been opened ultimately to
[55:39] give you victory in this life, to give
[55:42] you eyesight, to give you divine
[55:44] knowledge and to equip you so you don't
[55:48] have to be uh uh swept away with uh
[55:51] things that appear to be something that
[55:53] they're not. Now, don't forget just a
[55:56] couple of comments about deception.
[55:58] Deception. If you really want to talk
[56:00] about deception, deception would not be
[56:04] deception unless it is made to appear so
[56:07] attractive that people desire it.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Eve became deceived and she desired. She
[56:16] desired the very thing that Satan was
[56:18] offering through her through the
[56:20] embodiment of the serpent. She desired
[56:23] it and it was pleasant to look upon the
[56:26] enemy. Satan is not some cloven hoofed
[56:30] horned thing. It's not that. He's far
[56:33] more cunning than that. He comes in in
[56:35] all kinds of different ways. And I don't
[56:37] want to spend time on it. But that is
[56:40] why when the lamb himself
[56:44] opened the seals and made possible the
[56:48] content and revealed what was in the
[56:50] seals. And then he would send it down to
[56:54] a a a confirmed vessel, a vessel that
[56:59] had already been proven, a prophet
[57:02] vessel mouthpiece that had already been
[57:05] proven year in and year out.
[57:09] for hundreds of times and thousands of
[57:12] times so that the people have no excuse.
[57:16] As Jesus said, I did not say any of
[57:19] these things in a corner. We have people
[57:21] that have got their prophets and
[57:23] messengers and whatever more uh over in
[57:26] the eastern countries, prophets, the
[57:28] word prophet is not something unusual at
[57:30] all. Soon as you speak about a prophet
[57:32] in Asia, they simply want to know what
[57:35] did he say? They want to know. They're
[57:37] curious to know what kind of a
[57:39] messenger. But you won't find any that
[57:41] stood before the people and revealed the
[57:44] secrets of the hearts one after the
[57:46] other after the other after the other
[57:48] for over 30 years and true every single
[57:53] time. I say that God did something
[57:55] special. What he did, he confirmed a
[57:58] mouthpiece that he was going to speak
[58:00] other things through. And we say, "Oh,
[58:02] that's wonderful." you know that God
[58:04] spoke that spoke those things and
[58:07] revealed the secret of the heart. But it
[58:09] to me it's even more wonderful much more
[58:12] wonderful that God would open the eyes
[58:15] and the understanding of his children
[58:18] and then say look this way children look
[58:21] over here. Here he is.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Here he is. He's trying to hide here.
[58:27] Trying to hide behind behind religion.
[58:29] Trying to hide behind politics. But you
[58:32] just watch them join together now and
[58:34] alert you and I warn you. And here a
[58:37] prophet comes and says religious powers,
[58:40] political powers and demon powers. He's
[58:44] uniting them all together in this end
[58:47] time and homogenizing the whole thing.
[58:50] But there will be a people and there is
[58:52] a people who are not duped by that.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; They can see it because they've been
[58:58] given eyesight. And the scriptures which
[59:00] we've read, Jesus said, I'd like to just
[59:03] tie one thought together immediately.
[59:05] Jesus said, "Yet a little while,
[59:09] and the world seeth me no more, but you
[59:13] see me
[59:15] &gt;&gt; because I live, you shall live also." So
[59:18] now we have two groups immediately. Some
[59:21] that can't see
[59:23] &gt;&gt; and some that can see. when we read
[59:26] about Lucifer
[59:29] and we read about him
[59:32] uh with his boast how he will ascend and
[59:34] so on so forth and yet thou shalt be
[59:37] brought down to hell to the sides of the
[59:39] pit. And there's a very very wonderful
[59:43] statement here and it says they they
[59:48] that see thee, not all will see him. Not
[59:54] all will be able to identify him, but
[59:56] it's identifying a certain group of
[59:58] people here that will actually see him.
[1:00:02] And when they see him, when they can
[1:00:05] identify him,
[1:00:07] the Bible says they will narrowly,
[1:00:11] narrowly, in other words, that word is
[1:00:14] is that they will stare
[1:00:18] and ponder and they'll be able to
[1:00:22] identify him. They'll look right at him.
[1:00:25] And when they do, they look upon him and
[1:00:29] they will consider him saying
[1:00:33] that what they see will cause a response
[1:00:35] within this group of people and only
[1:00:38] this group of people. And they'll say,
[1:00:40] "Is this the man that made the earth to
[1:00:43] tremble?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Is this the man?" And look at the
[1:00:47] insight they get. That did cause the
[1:00:49] nations to shake and is this the man
[1:00:52] that made the world like a wilderness?
[1:00:55] And is this the man that has destroyed
[1:00:57] our cities? And is this the man that
[1:01:00] doesn't open the house of his prisoners?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, they got clued in
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; this group of people. And I'll say it's
[1:01:10] the same group
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; that Jesus said, "The world won't see
[1:01:14] me, but you'll see me."
[1:01:16] And this is the same group that also
[1:01:19] because God sends a prophet's voice, a
[1:01:22] messenger, and pulls the covers off,
[1:01:25] they can see him. And when they see him,
[1:01:28] they look narrowly on him. They stare
[1:01:31] and ponder and consider, "Is this the
[1:01:33] guy that bound me? Is this the guy that
[1:01:36] held me? Is this the guy that destroys
[1:01:38] our cities? Is this the guy that ruins
[1:01:41] our schools? Is this the guy that's in
[1:01:44] our politics? Is this the guy that
[1:01:47] brings our hospitals full of the sick
[1:01:49] and the afflicted and brings us down
[1:01:51] into brings them as prisoners and we
[1:01:53] refuses to open the door of the prison
[1:01:56] house?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Is this him?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; There's a group of people that's been
[1:02:04] given some eyesight.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Thank God there's a group of people that
[1:02:08] are not fooled
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; by the environment that's around us. I
[1:02:13] say thank God for the opening of the
[1:02:15] seals.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; We've been given eyesight.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; And because of that eyesight,
[1:02:26] they that see thee, we see him,
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; but we've also seen another one. We've
[1:02:32] seen the mighty conqueror.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we've heard his voice.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] In the seals
[1:02:44] there was a rider on a white horse.
[1:02:46] That's this fellow
[1:02:49] had a bow and no arrows.
[1:02:53] Then I took a service on the transition
[1:02:57] because with his bow it was in his time
[1:03:00] of having a doctrine but he hasn't got
[1:03:04] any power to enforce the doctrine.
[1:03:08] and some little deeds were taking place.
[1:03:10] They were carried over into the early
[1:03:14] church
[1:03:15] and uh
[1:03:18] he didn't have power to enforce
[1:03:24] what he felt he needed to. He needed a
[1:03:27] power.
[1:03:29] And so the in the transition between the
[1:03:32] white horse and the red horse which was
[1:03:34] the cruel time of cruelty and martyrdom
[1:03:38] and the time when he dispensed with a
[1:03:40] bull with no arrows and ended up with a
[1:03:42] sword.
[1:03:44] In that transition period that
[1:03:47] transition was a marriage of the church
[1:03:50] and state and because because they had
[1:03:53] to have the power of the state. So they
[1:03:56] had to unite the religious power and the
[1:03:59] political power because now through
[1:04:01] politics he could declare war. They
[1:04:03] could say kill these people. They're
[1:04:05] heretics. There are enemies. They could
[1:04:08] identify and make enemies as they still
[1:04:10] do today. they decide that the certain
[1:04:13] uh nation is a threat to freedom or a
[1:04:16] threat to democracy or whatever more and
[1:04:19] someone on the other side of the ocean
[1:04:21] or the other side of the world decides
[1:04:23] that America's a threat or England's a
[1:04:26] threat or France is a threat or
[1:04:28] Germany's a threat and they and and then
[1:04:30] they they create are you you know some
[1:04:33] kind of a uh uh emotionalism and whip
[1:04:36] the people up and and suddenly people
[1:04:39] that you thought were, you know, just
[1:04:42] common people like yourself. They have
[1:04:44] families and they have children and they
[1:04:46] have homes and they they love their
[1:04:48] children and whatever more. But suddenly
[1:04:49] they they become enemies and and and
[1:04:52] politics causes that. But the church now
[1:04:55] gained the power through the politics
[1:04:57] and was able to say they're our enemies
[1:05:00] and you go and kill them and slay them
[1:05:02] and you do God a service
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; which is still happening today.
[1:05:09] I've got pictures, I think I showed them
[1:05:12] here once, and I won't go into any
[1:05:13] detail,
[1:05:15] but where some of the Arab people,
[1:05:19] actually, Palestinians, we're taking
[1:05:21] young children, like we have sitting
[1:05:23] here in the front seats,
[1:05:25] 10, 11, 12 years old, not even into
[1:05:29] their teens, and strapping them with
[1:05:33] with with fake bombs to make them ready
[1:05:36] when they're 16, 17, 18 to go with live
[1:05:40] bombs, but indoctrinating them of the
[1:05:44] great reward that they would have. Well,
[1:05:48] I know if that were me, I know what I
[1:05:50] was like when I was a kid. I'd say, boy,
[1:05:53] if that's such a great reward and you're
[1:05:56] going to get so many such a reward and
[1:05:58] so many virgins are going to welcome you
[1:06:00] to the glorious place, you lead the way.
[1:06:05] You show me how it's done. And after
[1:06:07] you've done it, I'll make my choice
[1:06:09] whether I want to or not. But you don't
[1:06:11] find any of these fellas. I'd say when
[1:06:14] they have these world wars, they ought
[1:06:15] to put the world leaders in the boxing
[1:06:17] ring and let the best man win and let
[1:06:20] all us poor people go just free.
[1:06:22] Wouldn't that be better than slaying all
[1:06:23] our young men and all the rest of it?
[1:06:25] Well, that's politics. Politics is
[1:06:27] rotten.
[1:06:29] And as long as this world is governed
[1:06:32] under this fellow,
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; and don't get me wrong, I think that I
[1:06:36] think that the the struggle for freedom
[1:06:38] and everything has been a huh has been a
[1:06:42] necessary thing and God saw there were
[1:06:44] going to be these birth pains on the
[1:06:46] earth. We were going to have these world
[1:06:48] wars and these things were going to
[1:06:50] happen. But that's not God's. I can
[1:06:52] assure you on the other side there would
[1:06:54] be no such a thing. Amen.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; No such a thing as what whatsoever. And
[1:07:01] then this rider, he changed from a a red
[1:07:04] horse now to a black horse with a pair
[1:07:07] of uh balances or scales in his hand and
[1:07:12] uh controlling economics,
[1:07:15] but he could not hurt the oil and the
[1:07:17] wine. And then he there's a transition
[1:07:19] from there to a pale horse. And the
[1:07:22] brother Brandham goes into considerable
[1:07:24] detail in a number of places that it is
[1:07:27] the pale horse is actually a combination
[1:07:29] of the white horse which is deception,
[1:07:33] the red horse which is cruelty and the
[1:07:37] black horse which is the darkness and
[1:07:40] then on the on the pale horse that's
[1:07:42] what makes the pale horse. In other
[1:07:43] words, that's a power and we are we are
[1:07:46] living in a time now. Brother Brandham
[1:07:48] says that the pale horse rider one place
[1:07:49] he says he's doing his last ride now
[1:07:51] another place right after that the next
[1:07:53] sentence is that is after the church is
[1:07:56] gone and taken from the earth and he
[1:07:59] certainly will perfect his his right at
[1:08:01] that time but this would it would be
[1:08:04] hard to believe that he is certainly not
[1:08:07] or that the transition is taking place
[1:08:09] in that it is so incredibly difficult a
[1:08:14] person needs a divine fine instrument of
[1:08:19] discernment to be able to determine and
[1:08:21] to decipher. Look at how many look how
[1:08:24] many jobs and and and positions there
[1:08:26] are today. I would say that there's
[1:08:29] scarcely one position that a person
[1:08:32] can't be into. But what I don't care
[1:08:35] whether you're a school teacher or
[1:08:37] whether you're a nurse or whether you're
[1:08:40] a preacher
[1:08:41] or whether you're a truck driver or a
[1:08:44] farmer, whatever. At some point
[1:08:48] in your occupation or in your
[1:08:51] profession, you're going to run
[1:08:54] in a head-on collision with this fellow.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care where it is. You're going
[1:09:02] to run into him somewhere and there's
[1:09:03] going to be a twins down inside
[1:09:06] that witnesses to you, I can't go there.
[1:09:10] I can't go there. I can't go any
[1:09:12] further. And you have to declare
[1:09:15] yourself. And suddenly, you're the
[1:09:18] oddball out.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; You're the odd person.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; And you're looked at differently from
[1:09:25] that time and treated differently. And
[1:09:28] it can be very, very innocent. How about
[1:09:31] when uh a man works for professional a
[1:09:35] financial institution, he's going on up
[1:09:37] the ladder, up the ladder, up the
[1:09:39] ladder, and uh he just knowing in his
[1:09:43] heart he cannot be transferred that God
[1:09:47] wants me here in this place. He wants me
[1:09:50] in this town. And so he tells the tells
[1:09:53] the senior executive people, I'm not up
[1:09:56] for a transfer anymore.
[1:09:59] I feel that I need to reside here for
[1:10:02] his own spiritual reasons. And they
[1:10:05] said, well, you know, that's the end of
[1:10:06] the road. You can't go any place here.
[1:10:10] In other words, you're in a you are at a
[1:10:13] dead end. And that happened to be
[1:10:15] brother Tim Dodd. And now he's pastoring
[1:10:18] a very very nice work. But he had to
[1:10:21] know within himself, I can't go any
[1:10:24] further. And so his his profession
[1:10:27] actually comes to a dead halt.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; But as far as God is concerned, that's
[1:10:32] just really when things begin to happen
[1:10:34] for him.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Now the Apostle John,
[1:10:46] he was commanded
[1:10:48] with this with these words. when the
[1:10:51] when the seals were opened, he was
[1:10:53] commanded, "Come
[1:10:56] and see."
[1:10:58] And many years ago
[1:11:00] that stood out to me and I spoke a
[1:11:02] message on it. And again, this last week
[1:11:05] and especially as I move towards the
[1:11:08] service, I couldn't shake away from
[1:11:10] that. So, somebody here needs to hear
[1:11:13] what I'm going to say. Now you'll find
[1:11:16] that God's uh the way God deals with
[1:11:20] people is in this in a twofold manner
[1:11:23] and one is he attracts the people that's
[1:11:28] the come part and then but the coming
[1:11:32] does not open the eyes the coming does
[1:11:35] not
[1:11:37] meet your need in the ministry of Jesus
[1:11:40] Christ we'll just say all of his early
[1:11:43] ministry
[1:11:44] turned a, you know, he began to heal the
[1:11:47] sick and Peter's mother-in-law with a
[1:11:50] fever and the child raised from the dead
[1:11:52] and the multitudes fed and water turned
[1:11:56] to wine and all of these supernatural
[1:11:59] things. That was the come part of his
[1:12:02] ministry. And the people flocked to hear
[1:12:05] it and said, "What glorious things are
[1:12:08] coming?" Is not this the prophet? We
[1:12:11] have a prophet from Nazareth. And they
[1:12:14] were ready. They all moved on the
[1:12:16] invitation part and came. But then when
[1:12:20] it came to the only the only way, the
[1:12:24] only avenue, the only channel by which
[1:12:28] they could actually have sight was by by
[1:12:31] the words that were spoken. And that's
[1:12:34] why he said to the disciples, "The world
[1:12:37] won't see me anymore." Why? Because they
[1:12:40] were not going to receive his message,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; but you will see me.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; How are they going to see? It had
[1:12:47] nothing to do with the physical
[1:12:48] eyesight. And it had nothing to do with
[1:12:51] just being taught and being instructed
[1:12:54] or being indoctrinated.
[1:12:56] It's another system. It's another
[1:12:58] program. And the program is that we hear
[1:13:01] the word
[1:13:03] and believe the word.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; And once we hear it and believe it, then
[1:13:08] a Holy Spirit ignites that word and it
[1:13:11] it comes to life and we see it.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; It is a it is the act of revelation by
[1:13:18] God that actually gives insight. you you
[1:13:21] see something and let me just say to you
[1:13:24] and I'm not I'm just saying to you by
[1:13:27] way of confirmation to any person here
[1:13:31] because I begin to examine my own self.
[1:13:33] I begin to say to myself, what is it
[1:13:36] that God has revealed to me? I've
[1:13:40] learned a lot of things in life, but
[1:13:43] what is it that he actually has revealed
[1:13:46] to me that came as a revelation? I can
[1:13:49] tell you the serpent seed message have
[1:13:52] been a revelation.
[1:13:54] I can tell you that Malachi 4 five and
[1:13:58] six has been a divine revelation. And as
[1:14:02] when I think of those things again, I
[1:14:04] get that feeling, that excitement, that
[1:14:07] stimulation,
[1:14:09] if you want to say it that way. And as I
[1:14:11] pondered the things that I know were
[1:14:13] revelations to me, then I can assure you
[1:14:17] there isn't a devil in hell and Lucifer
[1:14:20] himself that can ever take it out of
[1:14:22] you. It is there and it's there
[1:14:25] eternally because it is eternal. It's
[1:14:28] part of God's word. If you just learned
[1:14:30] something,
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; if you're just made to be convinced of
[1:14:35] something, someone else who's smarter
[1:14:37] and a better talker may convince you out
[1:14:40] of it and may convince you the other
[1:14:42] way. And there are some people who only
[1:14:44] learn the message. Brother Brandham
[1:14:46] makes an makes an example between the
[1:14:48] woman at the well who had not been
[1:14:51] taught. She was even confused. The Jews
[1:14:54] say we're to worship in Jerusalem and
[1:14:56] the Samaritans say we're to worship in
[1:14:58] this mountain. I don't know where we're
[1:15:00] to worship. All she knew is there was a
[1:15:02] difference of opinion on worship. We
[1:15:05] could say, well, we got the Baptist over
[1:15:06] in 64th and we got the free Presbyterian
[1:15:09] over here on 188th, I think it is, and
[1:15:12] we got the Salvation Army, the East
[1:15:15] Indian just around the corner with a
[1:15:17] with a a temple there. A little temple
[1:15:19] used to be Jehovah's Witnesses. So the
[1:15:21] Jehovah's Witnesses are over there. We
[1:15:24] got all of these different people. They
[1:15:25] worship this way. They worship which is
[1:15:27] the way to worship. Jesus said how to
[1:15:29] worship in spirit and truth.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; And God must confirm. He's duty bound to
[1:15:37] confirm his truth. How? Supernaturally.
[1:15:40] Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; So he said the woman at the well said
[1:15:45] but the priest when the priest saw Jesus
[1:15:49] Christ and make himself known they said
[1:15:53] bellub.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; But when the same man made himself known
[1:15:58] to this illiterate woman she said
[1:16:00] Messiah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; There was the difference. One could say
[1:16:05] Messiah
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; and one could say Belub and they hear
[1:16:09] this message and some say Belub, but the
[1:16:12] others say Messiah.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that happens to be as
[1:16:18] far different as you can get. That
[1:16:21] happens to be the most opposite of all
[1:16:23] polls.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; I say Messiah.
[1:16:30] A revelation of this word to me is
[1:16:33] Messiah.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; But he said the difference between the
[1:16:36] woman and the priest was the priest
[1:16:39] learned it.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; He learned what the law had said. He
[1:16:44] learned how he was supposed. He learned
[1:16:46] that he should have a Passover. He
[1:16:48] learned all of these religious acts and
[1:16:50] religious things. And so but when it
[1:16:53] came and the and Christ uh the
[1:16:56] manifestation of Christ and what Christ
[1:16:58] was speaking cut across that then he
[1:17:01] turned away from it. Said it's Belub
[1:17:04] because it was in opposition to what he
[1:17:06] had learned. But that what he had
[1:17:08] learned didn't bring a life. What he had
[1:17:11] learned didn't bring him insight. Didn't
[1:17:13] give him sight. But Jesus said there'll
[1:17:16] be a people they won't see it. To them
[1:17:19] it'll be error. To them, it'll be
[1:17:21] heresy. And to others that say, "It's
[1:17:23] the devil. It's Belubam. It's of the
[1:17:26] devil." I feel sorry for them.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I believe it's
[1:17:30] unforgivable sin.
[1:17:33] I believe it's blaspheming against the
[1:17:34] Holy Spirit to take what God did in this
[1:17:37] generation, as clear as it is, and say
[1:17:39] it's of the devil. Yes, sir.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; I've had people
[1:17:45] I don't advise you to say this to do it,
[1:17:48] but I've had people resist
[1:17:52] vminently
[1:17:54] this message.
[1:17:57] And I just said to them, say, say to me
[1:18:02] that Brother Brandham was of the devil.
[1:18:08] And they just look
[1:18:11] and I said, "Say it.
[1:18:15] Say it."
[1:18:17] And I'm glad they didn't.
[1:18:22] As far as I'm concerned, that's
[1:18:24] unforgivable sin where Jesus said it
[1:18:27] will not be forgiven in this world nor
[1:18:30] in the world to come.
[1:18:32] And brother Brandham says the coming of
[1:18:34] the Holy Spirit in this day.
[1:18:39] It's a serious time, isn't it?
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; God gave you eyesight?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; We don't just see him. We also look
[1:18:50] narrowly. I see Satan in every corner of
[1:18:54] our in every corner of our whole
[1:18:56] environment. I see him everywhere.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; I see him want to tamper with everything
[1:19:01] that he possibly can get his uh dirty
[1:19:04] hands upon. And and I think we ought to
[1:19:07] be ready to declare, Satan, you have no
[1:19:09] part with this. You have no part of my
[1:19:11] home. You have no part of my life. You
[1:19:14] have no part of my environment. I can
[1:19:16] see you. I look narrowly on you. I can
[1:19:18] stare at you and stare you down because
[1:19:21] God has uncovered you.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; I feel almost like stopping preaching
[1:19:29] and just giving God glory.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for eyesight like we have.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful this morning?
[1:19:40] Somebody think, "Oh, this is just
[1:19:42] wonderful." And you say, "Not for me. I
[1:19:45] think it's a big trap.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; This looks like great opportunity. I
[1:19:50] think it's a snare." We got two
[1:19:52] different words for it. I think things
[1:19:54] are going great. I'm sorry. I don't
[1:19:56] think they're going so great. For me,
[1:19:58] they're going great for God's children.
[1:20:00] They're going great. But as far as the
[1:20:02] community at large is concerned and look
[1:20:04] at how they struggle and strive to make
[1:20:06] things, I think that they ought to make
[1:20:08] things as good as they can. But we don't
[1:20:11] have the answer. We don't have the
[1:20:13] answer in the city hall. We don't have
[1:20:15] the answer in the county. We don't have
[1:20:17] the answer at the state level. We don't
[1:20:20] have the answer nationally. We have the
[1:20:23] answer only through a message that came.
[1:20:25] That is the answer that we have. You
[1:20:27] might say, "I'm a fanatic." Well, I'll
[1:20:29] I'll speak as long as I can as a fanatic
[1:20:32] and leave this world as a fanatic as far
[1:20:35] as that goes.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; And the same people will turn around and
[1:20:42] as I've said many times before, they
[1:20:44] look at your lives and admire, admire it
[1:20:49] and desire it, but have not got the
[1:20:51] wherewithal because they have not
[1:20:54] believed. And without believing, you
[1:20:56] have no eyesight. As long as that
[1:20:58] resistance is there, you have no
[1:21:01] eyesight.
[1:21:04] And so we can see it in in Moses. Let me
[1:21:07] hurry along. In Moses, look at look at
[1:21:11] the coming part. Look at the coming part
[1:21:15] here. He meets and the Bible says that
[1:21:19] he saw this sight of the burning bush
[1:21:22] and he said, "I will go and see this
[1:21:24] burning bush." Brother Brandham said God
[1:21:28] was attracting his prophet. He had to
[1:21:30] attract him first.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; So he attracted him and then when the
[1:21:34] prophet got attracted and the word came
[1:21:37] to him, he was able to go down to Egypt
[1:21:39] and then begin to demonstrate this God
[1:21:42] that he had met. God's not afraid of
[1:21:44] showing himself. He began to demonstrate
[1:21:46] this God. And through that, God
[1:21:48] attracted the people. Not only not only
[1:21:52] the children of Israel, but also mixed
[1:21:55] multitude. They said, "We've never seen
[1:21:57] anything like this. This has to be the
[1:21:59] true God. And so, we're going to go
[1:22:01] after Moses, God. We're going to follow
[1:22:03] Moses. Moses is God's prophet." And
[1:22:06] these people all came and went out. And
[1:22:08] so, that was the come part. That was the
[1:22:11] coming out part. And then, how now, now
[1:22:14] then what happened? But God wanted them
[1:22:16] to see who it was that was speaking. And
[1:22:19] it was not until Moses went up into the
[1:22:22] mountain and came back down
[1:22:26] began to tell the people what God had
[1:22:30] said.
[1:22:32] And by hearing what God was said, the
[1:22:35] people now God was now defining himself
[1:22:39] what kind of a God this is, who this is.
[1:22:42] And so God, don't forget this, defines
[1:22:46] himself,
[1:22:48] defines who he is by word.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; It's his word. He speaks his word. And
[1:22:55] that is how we see him. Right.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And then when the people saw who it was
[1:23:03] that was speaking, now all they saw with
[1:23:06] their physical eyes was a mountain
[1:23:08] burning with fire and and heard with
[1:23:11] their literal ears the rumbling of the
[1:23:13] mountain and the great thunder and saw
[1:23:16] the great darkness also come over the
[1:23:19] mountain. And then they decided that was
[1:23:21] too awesome. That was too fearful. Don't
[1:23:24] speak to us anymore. like don't have God
[1:23:26] speak to us directly like that. Said to
[1:23:28] Moses, "You speak to us. You go up and
[1:23:30] get it and come back down." And Moses
[1:23:34] began to give him the word, give him the
[1:23:35] word, give him the word. And that's what
[1:23:37] gave them eyesight.
[1:23:39] Then they begin to see who God was. And
[1:23:43] that multitude, you know what happened?
[1:23:45] Died in the wilderness.
[1:23:48] But the Apostle Paul says, "We are not
[1:23:52] of those who draw back."
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; What's he saying? He's talking about a
[1:23:58] group of people that draw back.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; And this multitude that Jesus came that
[1:24:03] came out to hear Jesus and hear the
[1:24:06] glorious things and see the marvelous
[1:24:09] works and swept up into a euphoric state
[1:24:12] saying, "This must be our king. That's
[1:24:15] right.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; We want to make him king. And tearing.
[1:24:19] Don't tell me they weren't stimulated.
[1:24:21] They tore the branches off the palm
[1:24:22] trees, waved the palms, took their
[1:24:25] jackets off, their coats off, their
[1:24:26] their garments off, and strew them down
[1:24:29] and let the little uh animal carrying
[1:24:32] the Lord Jesus uh come over them and and
[1:24:35] waving and shouting, "Oh, hosana, hosana
[1:24:39] in the highest."
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; And it had to be so.
[1:24:45] Jesus said if they stop the rocks are
[1:24:47] going to immediately cry out. They had
[1:24:49] to do it. But it was only a week later.
[1:24:52] The same mobs were saying crucify,
[1:24:55] crucify, crucify. Why? Because they did
[1:24:59] not see him by his word, they didn't
[1:25:01] hear his message. Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; And the same people today in this hour
[1:25:08] when the Lord Jesus Christ manifested
[1:25:10] himself and came down in visible form.
[1:25:14] When I say visible form, how visible can
[1:25:16] you get?
[1:25:18] Setting the giving eyesight to the
[1:25:21] blind, speech to the dumb, casting out
[1:25:25] the deaf spirit as I heard yesterday saw
[1:25:28] the brother Vandom speak and just
[1:25:30] speaking so simply. and here's a person
[1:25:32] and they can't hear. He said now it may
[1:25:35] be a nerve.
[1:25:37] It may be a nerve that's gone dead and
[1:25:39] it'll have to be life will have to come
[1:25:41] back and it'll take some time. But he
[1:25:44] says but it's a spirit. It's a demon
[1:25:47] spirit that's caused this and cast out
[1:25:50] that spirit and that person gets their
[1:25:54] hearing again.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. how God confirmed himself
[1:25:59] over and over again. But then when the
[1:26:03] word when God begins to define himself
[1:26:05] and show who he is and speak his message
[1:26:08] out, those same people,
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; those who sat on the platform, those who
[1:26:14] enjoyed and reveled in the supernatural,
[1:26:17] turned from the word, but that was God.
[1:26:20] And that's the only thing that gives you
[1:26:21] eyesight.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; It's only the spoken word that can give
[1:26:24] you eyesight. Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; And this word come, I'd like to give it
[1:26:30] to you in the uh in the actual Greek
[1:26:36] because there's a there's two or three
[1:26:39] things that are very very beautiful to
[1:26:40] it. Are you listening?
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; When this word come, because there are a
[1:26:47] number of words that can be used in the
[1:26:50] Greek, but this one here is this kind of
[1:26:53] invitation. come from one place to
[1:26:57] another. The intent is not not just come
[1:27:00] here, but the intent is I want to move
[1:27:04] you from where you are to another place.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Come. And so the living creature, the
[1:27:11] beast said,
[1:27:13] living creature said to John, "Come."
[1:27:16] And you know, we were represented in
[1:27:18] John.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Come.
[1:27:22] I I know. And I pondered this as I was
[1:27:26] studying yesterday. I thought, "Oh, God,
[1:27:28] the people I'm going to be talking to,
[1:27:31] there's a I trust it be 100%. I do not
[1:27:34] know."
[1:27:36] But they've heard
[1:27:38] they've heard an inner invitation.
[1:27:41] And I hope that they realized that when
[1:27:44] God gave that invitation for you to
[1:27:46] come, his intention was to move you from
[1:27:50] where you are
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; to where he wants you to be. And I
[1:27:55] believe that even as we hear the word
[1:27:57] meeting after meeting that there's still
[1:28:00] that element there, God's purpose, God's
[1:28:04] intent, he wants to move you from where
[1:28:06] you are now
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; to where he intends you to be. And you
[1:28:11] might be sitting here defeated. You
[1:28:14] might be sitting here bound. You might
[1:28:16] be sitting here having struggled with
[1:28:18] something till you're almost ready to
[1:28:20] give up. You might be sitting here
[1:28:22] totally lost. I don't know. You might be
[1:28:24] sitting here just defeated, mentally
[1:28:27] wore down. I want to tell you, God wants
[1:28:29] to move you. And he wants to use this
[1:28:31] service to say to you, come out of
[1:28:33] there.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Come move from that place. God has a
[1:28:37] plan for you. And he wants to move you
[1:28:40] from where you are now to where he has a
[1:28:43] place for you.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you, it's not a place of
[1:28:48] defeated. It's not a place of defeat.
[1:28:51] It's not a place where we c excuse me
[1:28:54] cower under the under the power of the
[1:28:56] enemy. It's not that kind of a place.
[1:28:58] It's a place where you have you have
[1:29:00] power over him. That's why I said we are
[1:29:03] overcomers.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; It is also to arise.
[1:29:13] It is also come
[1:29:17] is to be established. I want you to be
[1:29:19] established.
[1:29:21] And this is very very important in this
[1:29:23] day because I can tell you
[1:29:26] from my perspective and from my vantage
[1:29:28] point
[1:29:30] I see a lot of people today
[1:29:35] and they have not become really
[1:29:36] established. I believe that they believe
[1:29:39] the message. I believe that they have
[1:29:41] had an encounter with Jesus Christ, but
[1:29:45] for whatever reason, their roots have
[1:29:48] not gone really down deep.
[1:29:50] And if you're going through a shaking
[1:29:52] time, I say, "Praise God for that." God
[1:29:55] wants your roots to go down. God wants
[1:29:57] you to be established. And there's there
[1:29:59] there's there that is one characteristic
[1:30:04] that cannot be substituted by anything
[1:30:07] else or cannot be developed by anything
[1:30:09] else and that is stability.
[1:30:14] I always think of Abraham
[1:30:16] faithful Abraham the prophet preached
[1:30:19] faithful Abraham because you find him
[1:30:23] and I use the word plotting. Abraham
[1:30:26] plotted. Oh God, give us people today
[1:30:30] that are absolutely unmovable
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; regardless of what happens.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; To be established, come. Be established.
[1:30:45] And the last here that I have chosen
[1:30:47] under this come is to follow one. This
[1:30:52] is an invitation to follow. Not just a
[1:30:55] spurt in a moment, but to follow one. I
[1:30:58] know a little bit about following
[1:31:00] people.
[1:31:03] And the more dangerous the thing is,
[1:31:06] the more closely you want to follow.
[1:31:09] And uh I I'm just going to make this
[1:31:13] brief, but I had an I had a situation
[1:31:15] once where a young native man
[1:31:18] was had been charged by uh a couple of
[1:31:21] white men. And these white men were evil
[1:31:25] men.
[1:31:27] And they had tried to get this man to
[1:31:29] get them a a prostitute.
[1:31:33] And he said no. And they struck him with
[1:31:36] a bottle of beer, a full bottle of beer.
[1:31:38] Struck him on the head and took and laid
[1:31:41] him out across the railway tracks, the
[1:31:44] British Columbia railway tracks, because
[1:31:46] they knew a railway come that night. and
[1:31:49] he woke up prior to that and got off the
[1:31:53] railway tracks and he was wounded and
[1:31:56] these men had charged and these men had
[1:31:58] charged him and uh charged him with an
[1:32:01] assault. They charged him with an
[1:32:04] assault and they struck him and tried to
[1:32:06] murder him. And so he was my he was my
[1:32:09] friend even though he wasn't he wasn't a
[1:32:12] Christian yet. his wife became a
[1:32:13] believer.
[1:32:15] And so I took I took up his I took up
[1:32:18] his cause and I went to a lawyer and I
[1:32:21] said they tried to tried to put this man
[1:32:24] in jail, tried to get him an assault and
[1:32:28] it's completely those men ought to go to
[1:32:30] and serve time. I told him the story.
[1:32:33] They represented him and the case got
[1:32:35] thrown out and he was a free man. Well,
[1:32:39] his daddy, actually his grandpa who
[1:32:41] raised him as a dad,
[1:32:44] he came off his trap line one day and he
[1:32:46] says, "There's a huge grizzly up there
[1:32:51] and I killed a black bear and I think
[1:32:53] that grizzly is going to come on that
[1:32:55] black bear." He said, "You know, go into
[1:32:58] town, get Ed, cuz he wants he wants a
[1:33:00] grizzly." And so George came into town
[1:33:04] to get me.
[1:33:06] And actually he he he he delays a couple
[1:33:09] of days and finally calls me and so we
[1:33:12] we leave and we go up there and we cross
[1:33:16] a river and we go up this road a long
[1:33:18] ways not driving now we're having to
[1:33:22] walk. I think they took us into the farm
[1:33:24] tractor and then left us.
[1:33:29] And so we we spend this afternoon
[1:33:31] walking and we come to where this bear
[1:33:34] had been killed, a big black bear, and
[1:33:36] there was only one little bone left.
[1:33:39] This animal had eaten the hide and the
[1:33:42] hair and all the bones and the skull, as
[1:33:44] thick as a a bear's skull is, ate
[1:33:47] everything up. And and I can tell you,
[1:33:50] he the the the ground was just as smooth
[1:33:52] as this carpet right now. And I looked
[1:33:55] at that site, said, "Boy, this fellow
[1:33:58] knows what he's doing.
[1:34:01] This guy's nothing to play with." And so
[1:34:04] we made our way back. It was a beautiful
[1:34:06] hot day, and we're making our way back.
[1:34:09] And it just soft powder dust on this
[1:34:11] little trail, little old old mining
[1:34:14] trail or something. And I saw the
[1:34:17] biggest tracks I ever saw. And when he
[1:34:20] saw it, he said, "Who? Who?" And this
[1:34:22] this boy knew what he was doing. George
[1:34:25] knew what he was doing. He says that's
[1:34:26] maybe 15, not 20 minutes old, that bear.
[1:34:30] And you know what he did? He actually
[1:34:32] was following us, but we didn't know it.
[1:34:35] And we stopped at a little fishing hole
[1:34:37] just to sit there for a bit. And that
[1:34:40] bear walked around us and walked in
[1:34:42] front of us. And then we came on his
[1:34:44] tracks. I lie not. I laid my hand
[1:34:49] in the heel across the heel. That was
[1:34:52] the width of his heel
[1:34:55] from there to the end. That was just the
[1:34:56] width of his heel. And we measured the
[1:34:59] length of it and we figured his paw was
[1:35:01] 13 in long.
[1:35:04] He was a massive bear. They figured he
[1:35:06] weighed over a,000 lbs cuz he stepped on
[1:35:09] a goodiz log and broke it.
[1:35:12] And we were going and I knew he was just
[1:35:15] 15 and the willows were thick.
[1:35:18] And here's this here's this native
[1:35:21] brother friend of mine, George, and he's
[1:35:23] going through the willows. Do you know
[1:35:26] where I was?
[1:35:28] Right on his tail.
[1:35:33] And he said to me, he was nervous. He
[1:35:35] said, he said, "I I'll I'll
[1:35:39] try to track him. You watch for him.
[1:35:44] Do you ever see an owl?
[1:35:48] I tell you what, I I had I had uh I was
[1:35:51] looking every direction and I was the
[1:35:53] only one packing a gun.
[1:35:56] I'm packing this gun and following this
[1:36:00] mammoth bear. He outsmarted us that
[1:36:03] evening. He outsmarted us and I don't
[1:36:05] know how he did. We were right behind
[1:36:07] him. Now, here's my spiritual truth. in
[1:36:10] this wilderness,
[1:36:12] in this devastation,
[1:36:15] in this
[1:36:17] generation,
[1:36:19] I would say, of smoldering ashes
[1:36:22] everywhere,
[1:36:24] God has laid out some footsteps for us
[1:36:26] to follow. And they're none other than
[1:36:28] the footsteps of the Son of Man. And you
[1:36:32] need to walk in them very carefully and
[1:36:34] see where the next one is and see where
[1:36:36] the next one. And don't move off that
[1:36:38] trail. Don't move off that track. I tell
[1:36:41] you what, friends, it isn't red willows
[1:36:43] that's our problem. It isn't a grizzly
[1:36:45] bear. It's a guy that has ridden into
[1:36:48] this generation. We're not talking about
[1:36:51] history. I'm talking about a cunning
[1:36:53] rider who who who watches as things
[1:36:57] transpire in civilization. And when he
[1:37:01] can't achieve anything on on the horse
[1:37:02] that he's on, on the power he's on, he
[1:37:04] watches the powers of the world and he
[1:37:07] gets on the other one. Now, I can't
[1:37:09] really do what I'm I can't really
[1:37:11] achieve what I want to achieve here in
[1:37:12] the church. And so, I better set up I
[1:37:15] better set up a council of of cardinals
[1:37:18] at uh in Washington. I better set that
[1:37:20] up also in London. And I better set that
[1:37:24] up in in Ottawa where they are. And I
[1:37:27] better set up and and there's a marriage
[1:37:29] and there's a union that's religious and
[1:37:32] there's and here we are little people
[1:37:34] down here. We're trying to sort things
[1:37:36] out. Thank God for eyesight. Thank God
[1:37:40] for a word. And that word, friends, when
[1:37:43] you read it, it's not a message book.
[1:37:44] It's vision.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; It's eyesight.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; It's knowledge.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; It's revelation.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Am I getting somewhere?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; And he didn't say just come, but he said
[1:37:59] to see. Now this attraction part he he
[1:38:03] said that divine healing usually
[1:38:05] attracts
[1:38:07] usually attracts and draws the attention
[1:38:10] of the people. He says then that
[1:38:12] attracts the attention of the people to
[1:38:14] know that there's a presence of a power
[1:38:17] somewhere that can do something that's
[1:38:21] beyond the human understanding. Isn't
[1:38:24] that a powerful statement? Listen to it
[1:38:26] again please.
[1:38:29] when this invitation has come this part
[1:38:32] of there was part of brother Bren was a
[1:38:34] part of Jesus ministry part of Moses'
[1:38:36] ministry it's all through the scripture
[1:38:38] and he says that is to attract the
[1:38:40] people
[1:38:44] quite frankly I haven't got enough time
[1:38:45] this morning to tell you but I see
[1:38:48] people that come
[1:38:50] and they come to the church
[1:38:54] and it depends on who it is but I'm a
[1:38:56] very very cautious person
[1:38:58] very cautious.
[1:39:02] You say, "What are you cautious about,
[1:39:03] Brother Ed?" Well, I know that here for
[1:39:07] the most part is the purchase of the
[1:39:10] blood of Jesus Christ, and I'm very
[1:39:11] zealous over it.
[1:39:14] And so then I ask,
[1:39:18] what what what are they attracted to?
[1:39:22] What is it that they are attracted to?
[1:39:25] And they're just attracted to, well, you
[1:39:27] know, you got nice stable families or
[1:39:29] you got lovely young people or you got
[1:39:31] fine young ladies. I would like
[1:39:32] something like that for a wife. You got
[1:39:34] fine young men. I'd like something like
[1:39:35] that for a husband. That won't work.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; That won't work. That's not why we're
[1:39:40] here. Or we got a nice program for the
[1:39:42] children. Or we got a school or we got
[1:39:43] this. What are they attracted to? Want
[1:39:45] to know that down inside they're
[1:39:48] attracted to the very very Christ that
[1:39:51] you were attracted to. The prophet said
[1:39:54] that the bridegroom,
[1:39:56] the bride is attracted to the
[1:39:58] bridegroom.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Who is the bridegroom? It's the word of
[1:40:05] God revealed, made known, revealed.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:40:16] You have to help me now.
[1:40:23] I've conducted probably a hundred
[1:40:24] weddings.
[1:40:28] I have found on occasion
[1:40:32] that the bridegroom and some of you
[1:40:35] sitting here possibly this morning when
[1:40:37] the bridegroom made his first approach
[1:40:39] to you
[1:40:41] as a young lady,
[1:40:44] you were actually scared of it. You were
[1:40:46] scared of him. You were scared of the
[1:40:47] commitment. You didn't want to have
[1:40:48] anything to do with it. and he went the
[1:40:50] other direction. Now, for a lot of you,
[1:40:51] it was love at first sight, of course,
[1:40:54] but for a lot of other people, it
[1:40:56] wasn't. When I first saw him, the
[1:40:59] message, I was afraid of him.
[1:41:04] I first begin to see, I was seeing there
[1:41:08] was something different in this
[1:41:10] ministry, the prophet's ministry. There
[1:41:13] was a part of it I loved. Oh, the blind
[1:41:16] girl healed in in in this place. Or
[1:41:19] telling the woman on the platform of the
[1:41:21] man dying with cancer up the road and I
[1:41:24] know the place and I know the woman and
[1:41:25] I know the town and I know all the other
[1:41:27] things. Oh, that's nothing to be afraid
[1:41:29] of there. But when it start to get, you
[1:41:32] know, that this is the this is a message
[1:41:34] and this is the Elijah which was for to
[1:41:36] come and this is the forerunning
[1:41:38] ministry and this will bring on the
[1:41:40] resurrection. This will bring on the
[1:41:41] rapture. those things began to be a
[1:41:44] little bit frightening because they're
[1:41:46] awesome.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; And when you really see it, it it is an
[1:41:50] awesome thing.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; You believe that? You regard that. But
[1:41:54] oh,
[1:41:56] as he made himself known, you fell in
[1:42:00] love.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, it became such a loving
[1:42:04] relationship.
[1:42:05] And then you said, "Will you marry this
[1:42:07] man?" Yes, I'll marry this man.
[1:42:10] Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; I'll become his wife.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; I'll give myself to him.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't just happen. You know,
[1:42:19] it's not a flash in the pan. It's not a
[1:42:21] Hollywood experience. This isn't a
[1:42:24] Hollywood romance. This isn't a true
[1:42:26] love story out of some filthy magazine.
[1:42:29] This is when the God that wrote this
[1:42:31] book makes himself known to you in the
[1:42:34] beauty of Jesus Christ, you fall in love
[1:42:36] with him.
[1:42:38] Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And I've got to I've got to come to a
[1:42:43] close because I don't want to keep you
[1:42:45] long
[1:42:47] and so I'm going to bypass some.
[1:42:50] But when he
[1:42:53] when Jesus said you'll you will see me
[1:43:04] and and he's used this in a certain
[1:43:06] certain specific way
[1:43:10] and this has been my experience and so I
[1:43:13] want to pass it on to you.
[1:43:16] You will view attentively
[1:43:20] my precious friends
[1:43:23] who we've traveled with, journeyied with
[1:43:25] for a lot of years, many of you.
[1:43:29] This is not a Sunday go to meeting
[1:43:32] religion.
[1:43:34] This is something you hear
[1:43:37] and you leave this place
[1:43:39] and you view it attentively.
[1:43:43] You view it
[1:43:45] and maybe you don't see it. Say, I
[1:43:47] didn't understand what the preacher
[1:43:49] said.
[1:43:51] I didn't grasp everything Sunday
[1:43:53] morning. Last Sunday morning. Do I just
[1:43:55] forget? Say, "Oh, I didn't understand
[1:43:57] that. I wasn't able to follow it.
[1:43:58] Sometimes I miss some words because I'm
[1:44:00] sitting behind. I don't have the same
[1:44:01] advantage you do." No, I'm not going to
[1:44:03] give up on that. I I want to hear what
[1:44:06] the spirit said to us.
[1:44:10] Hallelujah.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; And you that have heard it heard it
[1:44:13] again. What a joy it is.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; How beautiful it is.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; And so it is to view it attentively,
[1:44:21] to perceive with the eyes,
[1:44:24] to see in this context, you will see me.
[1:44:28] That word is so magnificent because it
[1:44:32] is also to enjoy the presence of one.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; You'll see me. Yes sir.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; He's saying I want you to enjoy the
[1:44:44] presence, my presence. That is his
[1:44:47] purpose. And listen friends, when God
[1:44:50] has a purpose in his mind, if you will
[1:44:52] connect with that same thought, if you
[1:44:55] will confess that same thing. There
[1:44:57] isn't anything in this world that can
[1:44:59] rob you of that. You maybe perhaps have
[1:45:02] not felt his presence. I want to
[1:45:04] announce to you today, you are eligible.
[1:45:08] to enjoy.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Not just a service. You're eligible.
[1:45:13] Young men, young ladies, you're
[1:45:15] eligible. Mothers, fathers, and
[1:45:17] families. You are eligible to go out of
[1:45:20] this service tonight and say or this
[1:45:22] morning and say, "I am eligible. I've
[1:45:25] been announced this morning that I am
[1:45:27] eligible to enjoy, to revel in, to enjoy
[1:45:31] his presence.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; This is not an intellectual exercise.
[1:45:38] This is not just a lesson. This is not
[1:45:40] just a Sunday school lesson. This is
[1:45:42] something that has feeling to it. This
[1:45:44] is something that the greatest lover
[1:45:46] that's ever been is inviting you to
[1:45:49] enjoy his presence.
[1:45:53] And if this horse rider has robbed you
[1:45:56] of that,
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to be closing in
[1:45:59] a few moments, but I'm going to close
[1:46:00] with something that the lamb himself
[1:46:02] said.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; And the lamb has imposed a certain
[1:46:07] restriction upon the horse rider of this
[1:46:11] age. He's imposed a restriction. In
[1:46:15] fact, this I'll go ahead and tell it
[1:46:17] because I'm here anyway. The Bible says
[1:46:20] and there was a the the the beast the
[1:46:22] living creature said that was that
[1:46:24] anointing that living creature he said
[1:46:27] come and see that was the invitation
[1:46:30] move the intent of God who commissioned
[1:46:32] him said take him from this place and to
[1:46:35] this place and to open their eyes but
[1:46:38] then
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; John heard a voice
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; from in the midst of the four living
[1:46:45] creatures and if you read in Revelation
[1:46:48] the 3r chapter I believe it is you'll
[1:46:51] find that that voice that he turned to
[1:46:54] see the fourth chapter fifth chapter he
[1:46:57] turned to see the lion and when he
[1:46:59] turned listen to me now because the
[1:47:01] positioning is important he turned to
[1:47:03] see the lion that had loosed the seals
[1:47:06] and he said he saw a lamb
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; and he gives the position of the lamb in
[1:47:11] the midst of the four living creatures
[1:47:13] and in the midst of the elders right in
[1:47:16] the center was the lamb
[1:47:18] And when he get over to this to this
[1:47:20] seal opening, the third seal, and the
[1:47:23] voice comes out from the living
[1:47:25] creature, come and see. But John hears
[1:47:29] another voice. He hasn't heard it in the
[1:47:32] other seals, but he hears another voice
[1:47:34] out from the midst of the four living
[1:47:36] creatures. Who is the lamb himself
[1:47:39] speaking? And the lamb says, "Hurt not
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; the oil and the wine. Amen.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; You cannot touch
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; the spirit
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; the portion of the spirit that I have
[1:47:53] allotted to my children and you cannot
[1:47:56] touch the revelation of the word.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Touch not.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; God has imposed a law upon Satan
[1:48:09] himself. And I want to announce to you,
[1:48:12] my brothers, my sister, the portion of
[1:48:15] the spirit that God has allotted to you
[1:48:18] and the revelation that he's made
[1:48:20] regardless. You may say, "Oh, it's so
[1:48:21] small. It's so little." But isn't it
[1:48:23] wonderful? Satan cannot touch it.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? He cannot make it
[1:48:29] diminish.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; He cannot take any of it away.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I don't sense it.
[1:48:35] I don't feel it. I don't." That doesn't
[1:48:37] mean it's gone. You still have it.
[1:48:40] It's yours
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; and he cannot take it.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; He cannot take it.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I'm not there." I
[1:48:51] say, "Move."
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Come from where you are.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Come.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Move.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; That was the intent of God. Don't stay
[1:49:00] where you're at.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; If you're bound or you're defeated, say
[1:49:04] it this morning. I'll be free.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; I accept my freedom.
[1:49:08] I receive that portion of the spirit
[1:49:10] that God has allotted to me and there's
[1:49:13] no devil in hell that can take it away.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; And that portion that revelation
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; might say, "Well, I don't have any great
[1:49:23] revelation." Do you know that God is
[1:49:25] one?
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know that you're to be baptized
[1:49:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Millions out there know nothing about
[1:49:32] it.
[1:49:34] You have revelation
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; and Satan cannot take that revelation
[1:49:39] from you. Nobody can take it from you.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you want to rejoice over
[1:49:43] that. That's why I came up with the
[1:49:45] course. We are more than conquerors.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; In his name, we're more
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; than victorious in his name.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Bless our sister. Hallelujah.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; This is our inheritance in Jesus Christ.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; God never intended that your inheritance
[1:50:10] should be depleted or diminished. In
[1:50:12] fact is when the children of Israel got
[1:50:14] in in Judges the first chapter and went
[1:50:17] in and you read it in the first chapter
[1:50:19] you'll find and and Benjamin failed to
[1:50:21] drive the this the Hittites out or the
[1:50:24] Jebusites out and all of the tribes
[1:50:27] failed to drive some of their people out
[1:50:29] of the valleys or out of the mountains
[1:50:30] or wherever more. And though they became
[1:50:33] a problem to them because they didn't
[1:50:36] inherit the whole thing,
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; but the day come when they took it all.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Hurt not
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; the oil
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; and the wine.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says further, he
[1:50:49] may afflict the body.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; He doesn't put in these words. There's a
[1:50:53] portion that he can get at
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; there is. He may destroy this body,
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; our sisters physically, but she's
[1:51:01] supposed to die a long time ago
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; and die before she even got the
[1:51:06] knowledge of the revelation of Jesus
[1:51:08] Christ. And here she stands today.
[1:51:10] Satan's afflicted her body, but he
[1:51:12] cannot take away.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; He cannot take away the oil and the
[1:51:16] wine.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; God may take this body. God may God may
[1:51:24] allow enemy to destroy us. And as he
[1:51:26] took Job and made him uh with boils from
[1:51:29] the top of his head to the soles of his
[1:51:32] feet, have you ever had a boil? He had
[1:51:34] them all over his body. And he was
[1:51:36] scraping it. What a dismal situation he
[1:51:39] was in. But there was one mandate. One
[1:51:42] mandate that was put upon Satan. You
[1:51:45] cannot take his life.
[1:51:49] You cannot destroy his life. And this
[1:51:51] horse rider that's rode into this
[1:51:53] generation. He may afflict you
[1:51:55] financially. He may afflict you uh uh
[1:51:58] physically. He may do all kinds of
[1:52:00] destructive work. There's one thing he
[1:52:02] cannot do. He cannot take the spirit
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; and the revelation
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; of God's word. Hallelujah.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's something that we get
[1:52:20] excited about.
[1:52:22] They get excited down the casino
[1:52:25] winning some winnings. They get excited
[1:52:27] at the horse race. They get excited over
[1:52:30] the football. They get excited over the
[1:52:32] puck. What's wrong with being excited
[1:52:34] about this?
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:52:39] Hallelujah.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; I'm excited about it.
[1:52:44] Lord,
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; it's one of the few places that we can
[1:52:47] just be ourselves.
[1:52:50] Glory to God.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Why don't you say what the lamb said?
[1:52:56] Hurt not
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; the oil and the wine.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hurt not
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; the oil and the wine. Glory to God.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why don't we stand to
[1:53:10] our feet?
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Why do we give him glory?
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:19] Dilia.
[1:53:20] [Music]
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; This blessed sister,
[1:53:34] Father. And what you've given to her, no
[1:53:37] man can take away. All the things that
[1:53:41] she has seen are glorious.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; And now her body, oh God, is in need of
[1:53:46] strength. Her body is in need of the
[1:53:49] virtue. Her body is in need of the work
[1:53:52] that was purchased for her at Calvary.
[1:53:55] Oh God, I pray you'll cast out the
[1:53:58] spirit of infirmity which has bound her
[1:54:01] and hindered her and let her from this
[1:54:04] day forth gain in her strength.
[1:54:07] Strengthen her ankle bones. Strengthen
[1:54:10] her feet, oh God. Strengthen her
[1:54:13] muscles, oh God. strengthen her in her
[1:54:16] faith, oh God, in the name of Jesus
[1:54:18] Christ that you and you alone will be
[1:54:21] glorified. We just want to glorify you.
[1:54:25] We want to magnify you in the blessed
[1:54:29] name of Jesus. We glorify him. Oh,
[1:54:33] hallelujah.
[1:54:35] Hallelujah. We praise him. And as a
[1:54:36] prophet of God said, just thank him.
[1:54:39] Praise him for it. Glory to God. He's
[1:54:42] done great things for you.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Never, never, never.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; The lamb has spoken.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Heard not
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; the oil and the wine. Glory to God.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; We praise him. We praise him. We bless
[1:55:13] your name. We bless your name. We bless
[1:55:16] his name. We bless his name. Hallelujah.
[1:55:21] Give him thanks. Give him praise.
[1:55:24] Oh, bless the Lord. Bless the Lord.
[1:55:28] Bring this atmosphere with you this
[1:55:30] evening.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Who else is worthy of this praise?
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Who else is worthy? There's none like
[1:55:38] him.
[1:55:43] Glory. Glory.

[2:00:01] Heat.
[2:00:11] You are
[2:00:17] the truth.
[2:00:22] I
[2:00:23] [Music]
[2:00:28] bless your name.
[2:00:33] Hallelujah.
[2:00:36] [Music]
[2:00:45] There was a a great hero in the
[2:00:51] in Switzerland
[2:00:53] and they remember this man
[2:00:56] Arnold von Winkler
[2:01:01] [Music]
[2:01:02] and a great heroic need that history
[2:01:05] says that he did
[2:01:11] and there was a
[2:01:13] the oncoming
[2:01:16] uh armies against Switzerland coming
[2:01:19] from Austria
[2:01:22] and uh he ran apparently this is what
[2:01:26] they say he ran into the front lines of
[2:01:30] all of those swords that were drawn
[2:01:32] those spears and plunged them into
[2:01:34] himself. mouth and cried out to those
[2:01:37] that were behind him, save my wife and
[2:01:39] children.
[2:01:42] And he made a breach in the lines of the
[2:01:46] oncoming army and so that there was a
[2:01:48] great victory. Brother Brandon simply
[2:01:51] uses that thought and he says, "But oh
[2:01:54] brother, sister,
[2:01:56] that was such a little thing to one day
[2:01:59] when Adam's race was backed up against a
[2:02:01] wall.
[2:02:03] They had had prophets. They had had law.
[2:02:08] They had they had killed the prophets
[2:02:10] and they destroyed the laws. And Adam's
[2:02:13] race was backed up, helpless and
[2:02:16] hopeless against the oncoming enemy. I
[2:02:20] can tell you friends, if it had not been
[2:02:22] for a message in this hour, I've not
[2:02:25] seen a church. I've not seen a religion.
[2:02:27] I've not seen anyone have been able to
[2:02:29] withstand this rider that has ridden
[2:02:32] into this generation.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; He's writing
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; today. He's writing. You're in church,
[2:02:38] but this enemy is riding.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; He's writing whatever power is is is
[2:02:43] that he can that he can utilize,
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; any scheme he can devise. He's a lot
[2:02:50] smarter than you or I.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; I thank God that the very mind of Christ
[2:02:55] has come down and been made known to us.
[2:02:58] And I don't take these services lightly.
[2:03:00] I don't take lightly. I don't take the
[2:03:02] message lightly.
[2:03:06] And we would have been hopeless to the
[2:03:07] oncoming enemy. He said the devil and
[2:03:10] all of his hosts, welltrained
[2:03:13] spirit beings.
[2:03:16] The mortal was no match for them at all.
[2:03:19] And what could they do? They were
[2:03:22] helpless. Are you listening to me? But
[2:03:25] there was one who stepped out of glory
[2:03:29] from the bosoms of the father. And he
[2:03:32] said, "I'll go down this day and give my
[2:03:35] life for Adam's fallen race." And when
[2:03:38] he was here on earth, he found the
[2:03:41] darkest spot of the spears that
[2:03:44] conquered man. And it was death. And the
[2:03:48] last rider to ride on the pale horse is
[2:03:51] death.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; But our conqueror,
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; he found that spot.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; And he grabbed an armful of them at
[2:04:02] Calvary and plunged himself to death.
[2:04:06] The devil never took his life.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Rome never took his life. The Jews never
[2:04:10] took his life. He took he gave his own
[2:04:12] life.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And he left the commission
[2:04:16] with his church, the little ragged
[2:04:18] group." And we're still a little ragged
[2:04:21] group, uneducated, illiterate fishermen.
[2:04:24] He never left with just, he said he
[2:04:26] never left with just sticks and stones
[2:04:28] to fight with. But on the day of
[2:04:30] Pentecost, he put the greatest weapon in
[2:04:32] the church's hands that it's ever had.
[2:04:35] And he said, "Follow me.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Fight with all that's in you." And I say
[2:04:41] that come has come to my come to my
[2:04:44] heart. Follow me.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Hallelujah."
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; And one came down. How we heard last
[2:04:51] Sunday, Revelation 10 and one. And this
[2:04:54] mighty angel, that's him.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; He wasn't coming defeated. He didn't
[2:04:59] have to come and plunge more arrows or
[2:05:02] darts or spears into his body. He had
[2:05:04] already given it. But he was saying to
[2:05:07] saying to his church in this hour, he's
[2:05:10] saying to us in this hour, death is
[2:05:13] conquered and the time has come. What he
[2:05:16] purchased back there, he intends it to
[2:05:19] be fulfilled.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:24] And he led the way. He was a mighty
[2:05:27] conqueror. He didn't conquer for himself
[2:05:31] and for his own glory, but he conquered
[2:05:34] for the good of Adam's fallen race. And
[2:05:37] there's been never never been a
[2:05:40] conqueror like that.
[2:05:43] I want to sing, I will praise him. I
[2:05:46] will praise him. And surely everybody
[2:05:48] here, we can bring the service to a
[2:05:51] close with that on our lips. I will
[2:05:56] praise him. Give him glory all ye
[2:06:00] people. You're not too weary for that,
[2:06:02] are you? Oh, give him all the praise and
[2:06:06] the glory. All of us together now would
[2:06:09] join in.
[2:06:12] I
[2:06:14] will praise him.
[2:06:18] I
[2:06:20] will praise him.
[2:06:23] Praise
[2:06:26] the Lamb for sinners.
[2:06:39] Holy
[2:06:45] for his blood has
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; just once more together.
[2:06:58] I
[2:07:00] will praise him.
[2:07:04] I
[2:07:06] will praise him.
[2:07:09] Praise
[2:07:12] the S.
[2:07:30] For his blood has washed away.
[2:07:38] [Music]
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Our heads bowed.
[2:07:45] Oh God,
[2:07:47] our God,
[2:07:49] you love fatherhood
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; and that's why you've brought us to
[2:07:53] yourself as your children.
[2:07:56] As I stand here, Lord, before these sons
[2:07:59] and daughters,
[2:08:01] those that you purchased at Calvary,
[2:08:05] Lord, to some perhaps you're saying,
[2:08:07] "Come."
[2:08:09] And for myself, I receive, oh God, the
[2:08:12] invitation
[2:08:13] that you'd have me move, Lord,
[2:08:17] into a higher height with you,
[2:08:21] God. God, how my soul yearns
[2:08:24] to see you even in more of your glory
[2:08:28] and your wondrous beauty in your word.
[2:08:32] Take this beloved precious body of
[2:08:35] people that are here and those that are
[2:08:38] elsewhere around the world at this
[2:08:41] moment.
[2:08:42] It's morning here and it may be evening
[2:08:45] and nighttime where others are
[2:08:47] listening. I pray oh God you'll embrace
[2:08:52] your children and let them feel those
[2:08:55] mighty arms undergurting them
[2:08:59] letting them know that they will face
[2:09:01] nothing in the coming days
[2:09:04] without your presence being there with
[2:09:07] them. Some will be in need of wisdom
[2:09:10] because they have to make a decision.
[2:09:13] Others are in need perhaps Lord
[2:09:16] financially or materially. I pray that
[2:09:20] you will supernaturally provide for
[2:09:23] them. Some may be in need physically. Oh
[2:09:27] God,
[2:09:29] come and do your mighty works that the
[2:09:32] name of Jesus Christ will be glorified.
[2:09:35] But above all things,
[2:09:38] Lord, even if some and at times perhaps
[2:09:42] our eyes get filmed over as it was with
[2:09:46] John the Baptist
[2:09:48] sending his servants and disciples and
[2:09:51] saying, "Go and ask him again, is it him
[2:09:54] or do we look for another?"
[2:09:57] And you sent them back with the
[2:09:58] confirmation, "No,
[2:10:01] it was you doing the same things. go and
[2:10:04] tell him what you see and hear. And I
[2:10:07] pray, Father, we will always remember
[2:10:09] what we've heard and what we say have
[2:10:10] seen. And Lord, I pray that you will
[2:10:13] make that a a quickened quickened to
[2:10:16] each one of us again.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask your blessings upon the
[2:10:21] people as we depart. And now to return
[2:10:24] this afternoon, Lord, and we'll hear our
[2:10:26] brother John Andy's, oh God, with a word
[2:10:29] that you've laid upon his heart. I pray
[2:10:32] that you will make this a a blessed day.
[2:10:36] And Lord, I'd ask you to be with our
[2:10:38] brother Tony as he journeys. Pray that
