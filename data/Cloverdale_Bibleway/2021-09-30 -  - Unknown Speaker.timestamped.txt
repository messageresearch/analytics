[24:42] known all god
[24:44] that we may able to receive something
[24:46] from you tonight father
[24:48] i pray oh god that you take your word
[24:49] tonight
[24:50] that you breathe life into the
[24:52] scriptures oh god that you'll may become
[24:54] substance in the hearts of your people
[24:56] that have gathered tonight with knees in
[24:58] our hearts lord i don't know their needs
[25:00] you know their needs father even better

[25:04] take the man aside lord god that you're
[25:06] able to speak life
[25:07] that we can have an encounter with you
[25:09] tonight for we pray in the name of the
[25:11] lord jesus christ amen
[25:14] thank you musicians
[25:17] good evening
[25:19] god bless you
[25:22] well
[25:23] last time we were here and we
[25:25] we pray that it will be a one-time thing
[25:29] let's pray tonight it'll be just a
[25:30] two-time thing
[25:36] i am very conscious that
[25:38] i have nothing to offer tonight but to
[25:40] as brother tom was telling me the back
[25:42] to make way for god himself to set
[25:44] myself aside that god
[25:46] may be able to speak tonight and that's
[25:47] my desire
[25:49] and i believe we come to church because
[25:51] we have needs right
[25:52] and uh it will be it will be a shame
[25:54] really to to go back home with the same
[25:57] needs uh and and not have the the
[25:59] opportunity to express them to the lord
[26:01] and have god speak back to us
[26:03] so you know your needs i i don't know
[26:05] your needs
[26:06] nobody here behind me knows your need
[26:07] but i i guarantee you if you come
[26:10] pulling
[26:11] and needing something of the lord and
[26:13] believing you'll receive it then
[26:15] certainly god will receive it uh god
[26:17] will give it to you and you'll receive
[26:18] it
[26:20] i'm not going to be bound by my notes
[26:21] i'm just going to relax and let the holy
[26:24] spirit really have his way
[26:25] so you really are able to have whatever
[26:27] you want tonight
[26:30] let's open our bible and in the book of
[26:32] isaiah chapter 55
[26:36] we're going to read verse 6 and verse 7.
[26:54] seek ye the lord while he may be found
[26:58] call ye upon him while he is near
[27:02] let the wicked forsake his way and the
[27:04] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[27:06] return unto the lord and he will have
[27:08] mercy upon him and to our god for he
[27:11] will abundantly pardon
[27:13] let's turn also to ephesians chapter 5
[27:15] verse 15.
[27:26] ephesians
[27:28] chapter 5 verse 15
[27:30] to
[27:32] 16. see then that ye walk
[27:36] circumspectly not as fools
[27:38] but as wise
[27:40] redeeming the time because the days are
[27:42] evil
[27:44] another translation says therefore see
[27:46] that you walk carefully living life with
[27:48] honor purpose and courage
[27:50] shining those who tolerate evil
[27:52] not as the unwise but as wise sensible
[27:56] discerning people
[27:57] making the very most of your time on
[28:00] earth
[28:01] recognizing and taking advantage of each
[28:04] opportunity and using it with wisdom and
[28:06] diligence because the days
[28:08] are evil
[28:10] let's have a little prayer
[28:13] heavenly father the scriptures are
[28:15] indeed inspired
[28:16] but the lord has told us that the letter
[28:18] killed by the spirit gives life
[28:20] so i pray father for the spirit of god
[28:22] whose presence we're in and we fail to
[28:25] unknown the words oh god that they can
[28:27] become life in the hearts of the people
[28:29] we once again commit ourselves into your
[28:31] hands the hearers and the speaker in the
[28:33] name of the lord jesus christ that you
[28:35] may be glorified in jesus name we pray
[28:38] amen
[28:40] you may have your seats
[28:49] redeem the time
[28:51] redeeming the time as we read another
[28:52] translation speaks about recognizing
[28:55] an opportunity and making use of every
[28:57] single opportunity we get
[29:00] our time on earth is made of moments
[29:05] even soccer games basketball games it's
[29:08] made of moments and usually when the
[29:10] game is over
[29:11] you remember the key moments of the game
[29:14] also known the highlights of the game
[29:17] and you remember them whether they were
[29:19] entertaining whether it was a goal
[29:20] scoring opportunity whether it was
[29:22] controversial call by the referee
[29:24] but you remember a game
[29:27] by those moments
[29:29] and our lives are defined by those
[29:31] moments
[29:32] we're remembered at the end of our lives
[29:34] by those moments
[29:36] and when we talk about something that's
[29:37] passed on you you recall specific
[29:39] moments with that person
[29:41] and the impression that we leave on
[29:42] people those are moments that they'll
[29:44] remember
[29:46] so
[29:49] when the bible records cain's life
[29:52] nothing much is recorded about his life
[29:54] because
[29:55] there is really nothing worth recording
[29:58] beside that moment
[30:00] and the moment where he killed his
[30:01] brother
[30:03] or the moment where he rejected the
[30:05] mercy of god
[30:08] so at the end of king's life his
[30:10] condemnation will not necessarily be
[30:11] about did he work did he work hard
[30:14] enough on his garden or on the condition
[30:16] of his fruits but what would condemn me
[30:19] what those moments
[30:21] the moments that he had and what he made
[30:23] of it the time and opportunity was given
[30:26] and what he did with that opportunity
[30:28] so in the service like tonight the word
[30:30] of god will come forth
[30:32] and each person here tonight will have a
[30:34] moment
[30:36] and we are all going to be given those
[30:38] moments in this in the service tonight
[30:40] and those are defining moments
[30:43] those moments are also called
[30:45] opportunities
[30:47] and tonight by the grace of god like to
[30:48] speak on the hour of opportunity
[30:51] and for a subject like to speak on the
[30:53] value of an opportunity
[30:55] an opportunity by definition is a set of
[30:57] circumstances that makes it possible to
[31:00] do something
[31:02] it's an occasion or a situation that
[31:04] makes it possible
[31:06] to accomplish something that you wanted
[31:08] to do or something that you must do
[31:11] another definition which which is very
[31:13] remarkable to me is it's a favorable
[31:16] juncture of circumstances
[31:18] and the juncture speaks about a point in
[31:20] time
[31:21] so there comes a point or a moment
[31:23] in time where circumstances are combined
[31:26] in a favorable way
[31:28] that gives you an opportunity
[31:31] and an opportunity really depends on
[31:33] those circumstances
[31:35] those circumstances on their own are
[31:37] irrelevant but when they combine at a
[31:39] specific juncture
[31:41] it gives room for an opportunity
[31:46] an opportunity is also a favorable
[31:48] appropriate or advantageous combination
[31:51] of circumstances it's a time that's
[31:54] convenient and fit
[31:55] or situation that's fit or placed as fit
[31:58] permitting to do something
[32:01] and when you talk about the value
[32:03] of an opportunity we're speaking about
[32:05] the importance or the worth or the
[32:07] usefulness
[32:09] that we that we assign or that we put on
[32:12] that opportunity how we value it
[32:16] there was a shoe salesman uh there was a
[32:19] shoe company who said who sent a
[32:20] salesman a long time ago in some part of
[32:22] africa
[32:24] and he was there for two weeks and he
[32:26] wrote back to his company a letter
[32:28] saying
[32:29] please bring me home
[32:31] nobody wears shoes here
[32:34] then they sent another salesman in his
[32:36] place and in a couple of weeks he sent a
[32:38] letter back to the company saying
[32:40] please send all the shoes you can
[32:42] nobody wears shoes here
[32:45] so it's the same circumstances
[32:48] but one
[32:49] had the eye
[32:50] to identify an opportunity
[32:53] and assign a value to it he didn't just
[32:56] say send 10 shoes he said send all the
[32:59] shoes you can possibly send for his put
[33:02] a certain value to that opportunity even
[33:05] though the circumstances were the same
[33:06] for both salesmen
[33:08] one was able to identify an opportunity
[33:11] and take it
[33:16] so the circumstances were the same but
[33:17] one is able to identify the opportunity
[33:20] and see that value
[33:21] and circumstances play an important role
[33:24] but it's when they're combined in the
[33:27] favorable way
[33:28] in other words
[33:30] there was a market where there was a
[33:32] need there was no shoes there was a
[33:34] company there was a salesman and there
[33:37] was stock and inventory now when you
[33:39] combine all those elements together and
[33:42] all those circumstances together at a
[33:43] specific juncture of time there's an
[33:46] opportunity that arises
[33:49] so to really understand opportunities
[33:51] you have to understand the circumstances
[33:54] uh for brothers you can start the slide
[33:56] show the first slide please
[34:00] there's been multiple opportunities
[34:03] missed in in the world
[34:07] you have the first one
[34:15] yeah there you go can everybody see that
[34:18] no
[34:20] okay we're good
[34:21] uh who knows about excite who's ever
[34:24] heard a company called excite
[34:26] who knows google
[34:28] right
[34:29] so when google was founded larry page
[34:32] and sergey brin the founders of google
[34:35] after laboring in the first couple of
[34:37] years they decided to sell google
[34:39] they went to a company called excite who
[34:41] also had a search engine and had a web
[34:42] portal
[34:43] and they offered to sell google for a
[34:45] million dollars
[34:47] the negotiated little only reduced the
[34:49] asking price to 750 000 dollars
[34:54] the ceo of uh exciting was george
[34:57] i'm forgetting his last name i think
[34:58] george bell there it is
[35:00] and uh
[35:01] he said no
[35:03] there is an opportunity
[35:05] to acquire google for 750 000
[35:09] and here a man who's a ceo interested to
[35:11] make decisions interesting to recognize
[35:14] opportunities of investment
[35:16] he didn't catch this opportunity and
[35:18] said no
[35:19] today google is worth 367 billion
[35:22] dollars
[35:24] and who knows excite
[35:25] nobody
[35:27] next
[35:28] slide
[35:30] alexander graham bell was he had offered
[35:33] the patent to western union for a
[35:34] hundred thousand dollars about for the
[35:36] telephone today it's it's about 2.4
[35:39] million dollars in today's money
[35:41] western union described the device as
[35:43] idiotic nobody will ever use that
[35:46] today there's more telephones on the
[35:47] earth than people
[35:50] another opportunity that was missed
[35:54] next slide
[35:56] roland wing and again if i may ask you
[35:58] who knows ronald wayne
[36:00] who knows steve jobs
[36:02] right we don't remember ronald wayne
[36:05] but he was one of the three founders of
[36:07] apple
[36:08] and in fact he had the one he was the
[36:09] one with the most money
[36:11] as all the three founders and he was the
[36:13] one who created the apple logo that you
[36:15] see the first logan was the one who
[36:16] created it he owned 10 of apple but he
[36:19] feared because he was wondering the most
[36:21] money if the company wanted debt the
[36:23] responsibility would be upon him
[36:25] so he decided to sell all his shares the
[36:27] 10 stick for 800
[36:31] in today's money is 3500
[36:34] apple is worth 2 trillion dollars today
[36:37] his 10
[36:38] share will be 200 billion dollars today
[36:43] this man is still alive kicking himself
[36:45] every single day
[36:47] his children when they read this dad why
[36:49] are you like this
[36:51] why couldn't you seize that opportunity
[36:55] so you see that throughout history and
[36:57] in business in in many circumstances
[37:00] there are opportunities
[37:01] we don't remember those who miss them
[37:04] remember those who take them
[37:07] and taking an opportunity really is the
[37:09] best thing you can do because once you
[37:11] miss it you can look back
[37:14] and regret
[37:16] today
[37:17] ronald wayne is still alive
[37:19] and he's not known at all he's 800
[37:23] dollars that he got i don't know why
[37:24] they bought with that but today will be
[37:26] worth 200 billion dollars
[37:31] so if you could turn back the clock
[37:34] you can take off the slice if you could
[37:36] turn back the clock and give this same
[37:38] man the same opportunity
[37:40] i guarantee you they will take it
[37:44] if ronald wayne today had the
[37:45] opportunity to go back in time
[37:48] and make a decision on whether to keep
[37:50] his 10 stick of apple or not i guarantee
[37:53] you he will keep his 10 stake
[37:56] because today he knows the value of the
[37:59] opportunity that he missed but he cannot
[38:02] go back in time and make a different
[38:04] decision
[38:06] but as for us it's easier now when we're
[38:09] looking today to see why didn't this man
[38:11] make the right decision
[38:13] well to be honest and to be fair it
[38:15] wasn't quite easy to discern
[38:17] because google for example was in the
[38:19] early stage of the company there was
[38:21] some risk involved
[38:22] apple
[38:23] the guy ronald wayne was in debt in the
[38:25] past so he had some concerns about if
[38:28] this doesn't work i'm going to be in
[38:29] debt again so there are some valid risks
[38:31] that perhaps they consider more than the
[38:33] opportunity itself
[38:35] so when you make an opportunity in the
[38:37] business world like them there are risks
[38:39] because they do not know how the
[38:41] opportunity will pan out
[38:43] so it's easier to determine or to decide
[38:46] whether or not to take an opportunity
[38:48] if you know how things will play out
[38:51] so the easiest opportunity that a man
[38:53] can make is eternal life
[38:56] because that is the easiest opportunity
[38:58] to identify because the outcome is
[39:01] guaranteed
[39:02] so if this is not a business whether
[39:05] some risk involved whether the company
[39:06] can go bankrupt this is an opportunity
[39:09] where you already know how it's going to
[39:11] end for god to love the world
[39:14] that is that he gave his only son that
[39:16] whoever believes in might receive
[39:19] eternal life so you know that when the
[39:21] opportunity comes to receive jesus
[39:23] christ
[39:24] there's no risk involved whether or not
[39:27] that's the right decision or not
[39:29] now you have the opportunity right now
[39:32] to make the right decision because
[39:34] there's records there's history there's
[39:37] a bible there are people who make the
[39:39] same decision as you and they can tell
[39:41] you what the outcome is so if you invest
[39:44] if you make the same decision they made
[39:47] accepting the same opportunity they took
[39:49] you will get the same reward they got
[39:54] amen when it comes to an opportunity
[39:57] there's an expression of
[39:58] window of opportunity
[40:01] or a dwarf opportunity
[40:04] no matter what metaphor you want to use
[40:05] it's always about something that can be
[40:07] open that can be closed
[40:09] so this conveys the thought that an
[40:11] opportunity can come
[40:13] and go
[40:14] it can be accessible one moment
[40:16] and gone the next
[40:19] ronald wayne today does not have the
[40:20] opportunity to keep his 10 percent share
[40:23] excites today doesn't have the
[40:25] opportunity to acquire google that
[40:27] opportunity came
[40:29] and it was gone
[40:31] so there's a window
[40:32] a time frame a specific window where
[40:35] it's possible
[40:37] to to
[40:38] act upon an opportunity and that is why
[40:40] we call you the juncture so there's a
[40:42] point in time where all circumstances
[40:44] are combined and unlined so perfectly
[40:47] that opens a window
[40:49] you have to take the window or it closes
[40:52] brother bottom says there's a kidney
[40:54] troubled lady right back there with the
[40:56] kidney condition you believe that god
[40:57] makes you well lady if you do raise up
[41:00] your hand and accept it respond to god's
[41:02] call you missed it
[41:04] i will show you whether you miss it or
[41:06] not it falls on this lady sitting right
[41:08] there with a handkerchief over her mouth
[41:10] this lady sitting right there also had a
[41:12] back trouble that's right lady
[41:14] yes sir you just come from an operation
[41:17] a cancer operation that's right your
[41:18] name is virginia that's right you're
[41:20] healed jesus christ makes you well you
[41:22] missed it mr anderson because you did
[41:24] not respond
[41:26] so the light moved upon a person
[41:29] a vision broke forth
[41:31] a window of opportunity to open up for a
[41:34] specific time frame
[41:36] she didn't act upon the window within
[41:39] that window the light moved upon
[41:41] somebody else that window closed and
[41:44] opened somewhere else that is how it is
[41:46] with an opportunity when god will give
[41:48] you a window if you do not take it the
[41:51] light moves upon somebody else
[41:57] a window of opportunity also called
[42:00] margin of opportunity or critical window
[42:03] is a period of time during which some
[42:06] action can be taken
[42:08] that will achieve a desired outcome
[42:11] once this period is over or the window
[42:14] is closed the specified outcome is no
[42:17] longer possible
[42:19] so you can only act within that window
[42:22] that you have
[42:24] if you do not respond to the opportunity
[42:27] like that sister here you miss your
[42:29] window
[42:32] can you bring up the the video of the
[42:35] rocket launch please
[42:38] just don't play it you can just bring it
[42:39] up
[42:42] in there's a window of opportunity or a
[42:46] window for a rocket launch it's a period
[42:48] of time where a particular rocket must
[42:50] be launched to reach its intended
[42:52] destination
[42:53] usually it's just a few hours if missed
[42:56] you must wait for the next window
[42:59] so if you can bring up the video and
[43:00] play it
[43:02] what you see in the middle there that's
[43:04] the sun and that's in the blue
[43:06] trajectory that's that's the path of the
[43:08] earth
[43:08] and then the green that's mars in purple
[43:11] that's a rocket that was launched with a
[43:13] payload called insight
[43:15] as you can see the earth is rotating
[43:18] mars is also rotating nothing is static
[43:20] waving
[43:21] so you have a window you have you can
[43:23] play it again you have a specific window
[43:25] to launch that payload so that it can
[43:27] reach its destination if you follow the
[43:29] video you will see exactly at what
[43:31] moment
[43:32] that payload arrives on mars in green so
[43:35] they line up perfectly because the
[43:38] rocket was launched within that window
[43:40] of opportunity if you had missed that
[43:43] window that rocket will not reach its
[43:45] destination
[43:46] so you only have a few hours and
[43:48] scientists they work so hard to find the
[43:50] windows of opportunity they call it
[43:53] orbital dynamics where what the
[43:54] conditions of the planet on earth and
[43:57] the conditions of the atmosphere in
[43:58] space are so lined up in a way that
[44:01] makes launching a rocket
[44:03] possible so they have to take those
[44:05] windows and in some cases what some some
[44:09] alignment of planets only happen once in
[44:11] 175 years you have to take that window
[44:14] or you have to wait another 200 years
[44:17] they're not going to be here
[44:19] so the way it's so critical
[44:21] to do what needs to be done when you
[44:23] have that window
[44:27] planting and harvest i think brother
[44:29] brother team died yesterday the bible
[44:30] said it was talking about the former
[44:32] reign of the latter in here there is a
[44:34] window for a gardener where you must
[44:36] plant where you must sow certain seeds
[44:39] to be able to receive a harvest so if
[44:41] you miss the season i i have no idea
[44:44] what i'm talking about by the way i
[44:45] don't understand seeds and plants and
[44:47] when to plant strawberries i want to
[44:49] print lettuce and tomatoes but there's a
[44:51] season where to plant tomatoes if you
[44:53] miss that window you have to wait
[44:56] because they will not grow the
[44:57] conditions will not be there anymore to
[45:00] be favorable for the growth of that seed
[45:02] so you have to take your window
[45:05] when it comes to reproduction there is a
[45:06] window where a woman is fertile if she
[45:08] doesn't receive seed in that window you
[45:11] have to wait for the next window
[45:14] when somebody has cardiac arrest
[45:16] you have about three to four minutes to
[45:19] perform cpr
[45:20] before they go brain dead
[45:22] so it's a critical window as soon as
[45:25] somebody goes in cardiac arrest you only
[45:27] have about three or four minutes
[45:30] and you can continue 10 minutes after
[45:32] but if you miss that window
[45:34] it's unlikely to save that person's life
[45:36] they'll be brain dead already because
[45:38] the only time that you're given to act
[45:40] is three to four minutes so you
[45:42] understand it in nature in science
[45:44] everywhere you look there are windows of
[45:46] opportunities that are given to us but
[45:48] if you don't take those windows what you
[45:50] wanted to do is no longer possible
[45:53] after a woman's fertility window has
[45:55] gone through you can no longer have a
[45:57] child after this opportunity window is
[46:00] missed nasa has to wait for the next one
[46:02] so it's up on us to take every single
[46:05] window of opportunity that is given to
[46:08] us
[46:17] and opportunity is a process
[46:22] an opportunity doesn't just
[46:24] happen like that you're like i just
[46:26] stumbled upon this great opportunity
[46:28] there's a process that's involved to
[46:30] bring about an opportunity
[46:31] so it's a combination as we say it's a
[46:33] combination of multiple events multiple
[46:35] circumstances and when they when they
[46:37] line up in a favorable way that's what
[46:40] we call opportunity
[46:41] but if we understood that it's not just
[46:44] a sudden appearing it's a building up
[46:47] then we could maybe appreciate
[46:49] more what an opportunity is for example
[46:51] when we come back to the lady who missed
[46:53] her chance of being healed
[46:55] it just didn't just happen and now she
[46:57] had an opportunity no somebody organized
[46:59] the meetings
[47:00] somebody paid for that building while
[47:02] the other meetings
[47:03] some newspaper ads or posters went above
[47:05] the meeting somebody heard about it and
[47:07] decided to come to the meeting there was
[47:09] a song leader who came and sang some
[47:11] songs people worshipping that service a
[47:13] prophet preached then people say amen to
[47:16] the word they responded to the word an
[47:18] atmosphere was created a prophet yielded
[47:20] to the holy spirit people started
[47:22] praying and believing and the light
[47:24] appeared in the room and the prophet
[47:26] followed that light it went upon
[47:28] somebody who believed a vision broke
[47:30] forth a window opened up then there is
[47:32] an opportunity
[47:34] but there is a building up there's a
[47:36] process many things that happen to lead
[47:39] to that moment of opportunity that is
[47:41] what happens in the service when you
[47:43] come to a moment where you receive an
[47:44] opportunity it just doesn't happen like
[47:47] that somebody prayed
[47:48] somebody fasted on monday night somebody
[47:51] was praying somebody studied the word
[47:53] somebody yielded somebody called
[47:55] somebody put the thought together to
[47:57] open a window of opportunity so if you
[48:01] understand all these circumstances line
[48:03] up to give you an opportunity tonight
[48:06] you will take your window
[48:07] [Applause]
[48:14] if you're mindful
[48:16] of an opportunity then you're more
[48:17] likely to stumble upon one or to
[48:20] identify one
[48:22] an opportunity comes to those who think
[48:23] about it
[48:25] you're more likely to let you find
[48:26] opportunity when it's alignment what's
[48:27] on your mind so if you're thinking about
[48:29] getting a car
[48:30] then when an opportunity comes to
[48:33] purchase a car you'll more likely be
[48:34] able to identify it because that's in
[48:36] line with what you're thinking about
[48:39] in in the world they seem to call it the
[48:40] law of attraction but the scripture
[48:42] talks about this in hebrews chapter 11
[48:43] verse 15
[48:45] talking about abraham who left his home
[48:47] the bible says and truly
[48:49] if they had been mindful
[48:51] of that country from once they came out
[48:54] they might have had an opportunity to
[48:56] return
[48:57] so if abraham when he left his house and
[49:00] left his family to follow the lord if he
[49:03] was constantly mindful he was thinking
[49:06] about what he left he would have
[49:08] received an opportunity
[49:10] to return so people that leave this
[49:13] message you know what they've been
[49:15] thinking about
[49:16] what they were mindful of because their
[49:18] mind was on the things that they left
[49:20] they got an opportunity to go back and
[49:24] when that opportunity came they took it
[49:26] because it's what they're mindful about
[49:28] so if you're mindful of something
[49:30] perhaps you need salvation and you're
[49:32] thinking about it lord i need to be
[49:34] saved because you're mindful you should
[49:36] be able to identify that tonight is your
[49:40] opportunity perhaps you need healing you
[49:43] should be able to identify that tonight
[49:45] is your opportunity maybe you're
[49:47] thinking about your life how down you
[49:49] feel your lord i'm so down i need
[49:51] comfort tonight will be your opportunity
[49:54] to receive comfort perhaps you're
[49:56] backslidden he said i need to come back
[49:58] home i don't know how tonight is an
[50:00] opportunity
[50:01] because an opportunity is based on what
[50:03] you're mindful of
[50:08] people must might miss the
[50:10] opportunities but i'll tell you about
[50:12] one man who doesn't miss his
[50:13] opportunities and that's the devil
[50:16] the devil would take any opportunity he
[50:18] gets
[50:20] in job chapter 1 you know the story
[50:23] when the sons of god came before god the
[50:26] bible says satan also came amongst them
[50:28] the lord asked him have you considered
[50:30] my servant job he said job really
[50:33] there's a reason why he's like this
[50:35] you've protected him you've blessed him
[50:36] allow me allow me to go touch him
[50:40] thou has blessed the work of his hand
[50:41] his substances increase in the land but
[50:43] pull from that hand now and touch all
[50:46] that he have and he will curse me to thy
[50:48] face and the lord said to satan behold
[50:51] all that he hath is in thy power only
[50:54] upon himself put not for the hand so you
[50:56] can touch everything he has
[50:58] except him himself
[51:01] now here's the devil
[51:02] acting upon god's word talking about
[51:04] taking god at his word
[51:06] god told him that he could do it he did
[51:08] it
[51:09] so he when the bible says that he went
[51:11] and took his sons his his uh his
[51:14] substance his animal everything that he
[51:15] owned except his own life
[51:18] now the devil gets a second opportunity
[51:20] he comes back to god again
[51:22] god says fine you can touch him but
[51:24] don't take his life the bible says and
[51:27] job was covered from boys from the sort
[51:29] from the soul of his feet to the crown
[51:30] of his head talk about taking everything
[51:33] you can talk about taking your
[51:34] opportunity since god told the devil
[51:37] that he could do it he did it so let's
[51:39] say that the devil wants to touch joe
[51:41] but maybe an angel stepped forward and
[51:42] said don't touch him he says god said i
[51:43] can
[51:44] the angel will back up because here is
[51:46] the devil act upon what god said he
[51:48] could have how about you when god said
[51:50] you can have something if the devil
[51:52] comes what are you doing you say god
[51:54] said i can't
[51:55] and god told the devil concerning job
[51:57] all that he has is in the power but i
[51:59] want to tell you concerning god that all
[52:01] that god is is in thy power you can have
[52:03] all that he is if you want salvation you
[52:05] can have it if you want peace you can
[52:07] have it if you want to hold it you can
[52:09] have it all that god is is in thy power
[52:12] if the devil can act upon god's word and
[52:14] take his opportunity surely there's a
[52:16] church tonight that can act upon god's
[52:18] word and take every window of
[52:20] opportunity
[52:25] hallelujah
[52:29] the devil is not shy or hesitant to
[52:31] seize an opportunity
[52:37] the something about the devil is that he
[52:39] has an incredible ability
[52:41] to recognize an opportunity and take it
[52:44] when jesus was in the wilderness after
[52:46] fasting for 40 days he got hungry and
[52:48] tired there's his window
[52:50] he comes to tempt him and after being
[52:53] overcome by the word the bible says in
[52:56] luke chapter 4 verse 13 and when the
[52:58] devil had ended all the temptation he
[53:00] departed from him for a season in the
[53:04] hebrews until the opportune time so he
[53:06] departed until there'll be another
[53:09] opportunity so the devil the bible says
[53:11] he's always looking like like a roaring
[53:13] lion seeking
[53:15] whom he may devour so while you're busy
[53:18] in life the devil is every day putting
[53:20] his head he has all his screens looking
[53:22] to find an opportunity constantly
[53:24] looking at all his all his graphs and
[53:27] all his cameras everything where can i
[53:29] find an opportunity and if the devil
[53:31] gets one you better believe he's going
[53:32] to take it
[53:38] in matthew chapter 14 verse 22
[53:40] and straightway jesus constrained his
[53:42] disciples to get into his ship
[53:45] and to go before him onto the other side
[53:49] while he sent the multitudes away
[53:51] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[53:53] he went up in the mountain apart to pray
[53:55] and when the evening was come he was
[53:57] there alone but the ship was down in the
[53:59] midst of the sea tossed with waves for
[54:02] the wind was contrary and in the fourth
[54:04] watch of the night jesus went unto them
[54:06] walking on the sea
[54:10] four things here or three things that
[54:11] you want to consider here in this in
[54:13] this verse
[54:14] number one is that
[54:17] the disciples went without jesus
[54:20] circumstances number one
[54:24] and then jesus went up on the mountain
[54:26] apart to pray circumstance number two
[54:29] then it was evening time circumstance
[54:31] number three and jesus was there alone
[54:34] number four the sheep was there in the
[54:36] midst of the sea now all these
[54:38] circumstances have combined
[54:40] and the door of opportunity opens for
[54:42] the devil
[54:44] if jesus was still with them
[54:46] maybe he would not have acted
[54:48] if they were still on land
[54:50] maybe we would have acted but because
[54:53] one the one without jesus two jesus is
[54:55] aware on the mountain three is now dark
[54:57] in the night not all these elements
[54:59] combined there is a window of
[55:02] opportunity that the devil is able to
[55:04] take
[55:07] very bad says
[55:08] about that time
[55:10] satan looked up over the rim and he saw
[55:13] the little boat out on the sea without
[55:14] jesus he thought
[55:16] here's my opportunity
[55:18] so it is tonight with every individual
[55:21] with every church with every member of
[55:23] the church when satan can see you alone
[55:26] without jesus it is his opportunity to
[55:30] smite you
[55:31] and brother cause goes on to say the
[55:34] devil was looking at them on the boat
[55:35] and he says i've caught them alone he's
[55:38] not with them now is my time to get even
[55:40] with them
[55:41] that's the way satan walks that's the
[55:43] way he watches that's the opportunity he
[55:46] waits for the devil is looking at your
[55:48] life every single day wanting to see if
[55:50] you're gonna give him a window if you're
[55:52] gonna do something without the lord if
[55:54] you're gonna go somewhere where god
[55:56] didn't lead you to go if you're gonna be
[55:57] disobedient whatever it is he's waiting
[56:00] watching your life carefully
[56:02] waiting for an opportunity and if you
[56:05] give him an opportunity he will smite
[56:07] you so tonight don't give the devil any
[56:10] opportunity keep your home clean don't
[56:13] open filthy shows on the television
[56:15] giving me a window of opportunity to
[56:17] come into your family
[56:23] don't be
[56:24] yoked with evil and with worldly people
[56:26] yes it's fun to have friends but don't
[56:28] two people can all walk together unless
[56:29] you agree and before you know it because
[56:32] of that atmosphere you're constantly in
[56:34] the devil starts to see a window of
[56:36] opportunity to open you better believe
[56:38] he's gonna take it
[56:47] satan patiently waited
[56:49] for all the circumstances to line up in
[56:52] a way that was favorable
[56:53] to achieve what he wanted to do which
[56:55] was to destroy the disciples
[56:57] and he will wait for you to reach your
[56:58] lowest point
[57:00] and a window opens for depression
[57:03] he will wait for you to reach your
[57:04] highest point and a window for pride
[57:07] opens up
[57:08] he will wait for you to go outside of
[57:10] god's will then a window comes from him
[57:12] to do whatever he wants because you are
[57:14] not protected when you're outside of
[57:15] god's will
[57:16] and the devil will watch you disobey the
[57:18] lord and then the spirit of disobedience
[57:21] which is the spirit of witchcraft will
[57:23] come inside of you
[57:25] oh i hate that spirit disobedience
[57:28] to know what the law requires of you but
[57:30] not to do it
[57:34] so the devil is always able to see the
[57:36] juncture
[57:37] that point in time where circumstances
[57:39] are favorable
[57:41] and sometimes it pays off
[57:43] the devil takes every opportunity he
[57:45] gets sometimes he's successful sometimes
[57:48] it doesn't
[57:50] but a true son of god
[57:52] when he recognizes an opportunity
[57:54] it always pays off
[57:56] always the devil can have ten thousand
[57:58] opportunities and you will take each one
[58:00] of them some you'll be successful some
[58:03] you fail but if you take ten thousand
[58:06] opportunities every single time it will
[58:08] pay off
[58:12] i'm not going to belong tonight
[58:15] judas had an opportunity
[58:18] brother i'm saying he had the same
[58:19] opportunity as the rest of the disciples
[58:21] but he wasn't convinced
[58:24] that that was the messiah oh my he
[58:26] walked with jesus christ for three and a
[58:28] half years and he was never convinced
[58:30] that that was the messiah he came to
[58:33] church service after service but he was
[58:35] never convinced that the message was
[58:37] true he came to church every single
[58:39] wednesday every sunday and every camp
[58:41] but he was never convinced that this was
[58:44] the truth i tell you if you're on the
[58:45] fence tonight here's the wind of
[58:47] opportunity can i be convinced that this
[58:50] message is true
[58:58] matthew 26 16
[59:01] then one of the 12 disciples called
[59:02] judas went unto the chief priest and
[59:05] said unto them what will you give me and
[59:08] i will deliver him unto you
[59:10] and the covenant with him for 30 pieces
[59:13] of silver
[59:14] and from that time he sought
[59:16] opportunity to betray him
[59:20] he had the opportunity to identify
[59:22] christ as the messiah and to be
[59:24] convinced that that was the messiah but
[59:27] because he rejected that opportunity he
[59:29] didn't take it he wasn't sincere he
[59:32] didn't desperately look for god to make
[59:34] that message real to him he was okay
[59:36] with association he was okay with
[59:38] fellowship but done in his soul there
[59:41] was never a real conviction about the
[59:43] message of the hour
[59:44] because he didn't take that window the
[59:46] devil gave him another
[59:49] and now the bible says from that time on
[59:52] he started looking
[59:53] for an opportunity to betray the world
[59:57] oh my
[59:59] if you reject the opportunity to receive
[1:00:00] christ the devil will give you multiple
[1:00:03] opportunities to betray this message
[1:00:06] don't you betray this message it is not
[1:00:08] said the lord it is the word of god for
[1:00:10] this day don't you betray it if you're
[1:00:13] not convinced you'd better get convinced
[1:00:15] tonight don't put up for another service
[1:00:18] you better receive truth tonight before
[1:00:20] you betray this glorious word
[1:00:24] imagine judas jesus christ is praying
[1:00:26] for the sick and he's looking do i have
[1:00:28] a window no
[1:00:30] the manic of gaddera comes running to
[1:00:32] jesus christ for deliverance jesus is
[1:00:33] looking that's not my window
[1:00:36] then he finds a window where christ is
[1:00:38] praying in the garden
[1:00:40] then when he got his window he took it
[1:00:42] but all those years
[1:00:44] instead of looking for an opportunity to
[1:00:46] receive christ and to be convinced he is
[1:00:48] looking for an opportunity to betray
[1:00:51] such as people today coming to church
[1:00:54] looking for an opportunity to criticize
[1:00:56] looking for an opportunity to be
[1:00:57] offended about something so they might
[1:00:59] get a reason an opportunity to live
[1:01:02] i was hurt because you were looking for
[1:01:04] an opportunity and when you got your
[1:01:06] door you left
[1:01:10] the love of the world was sealing those
[1:01:11] people when they gathered the
[1:01:13] opportunity they took it and left it was
[1:01:15] never about the message it was never
[1:01:17] about the ministry it was not about
[1:01:18] brother branham it was what was in their
[1:01:20] heart and when they got the opportunity
[1:01:23] they took it
[1:01:24] those who left the prophet they had the
[1:01:26] opportunity and they were looking for it
[1:01:28] and when they got to serpent seed
[1:01:30] there's my opportunity
[1:01:37] some other people in the bible had
[1:01:38] opportunities
[1:01:40] and they took it
[1:01:42] jacob
[1:01:44] one night
[1:01:45] had an opportunity
[1:01:47] with the angel of the lord
[1:01:49] he knew that his life he needed his life
[1:01:51] to be changed he knew that he needed his
[1:01:53] walk to be changed he knew that he
[1:01:55] needed a nature change
[1:01:57] for he was a shy story deceiver and he
[1:01:59] wanted his nature to be completely
[1:02:01] transformed and when that night
[1:02:04] a door of opportunity opened up and the
[1:02:06] angel luck came down in the scene he
[1:02:08] said i will not let you go because this
[1:02:11] is my window of opportunity but angelo
[1:02:14] told him it's almost morning this window
[1:02:16] of opportunity is almost closed he says
[1:02:18] i'm not done with you yet i will not let
[1:02:20] you go can you fill me with the holy
[1:02:22] ghost i will not let you go do you
[1:02:24] convince me of this message i will not
[1:02:26] let you go do you change my life you
[1:02:29] take your win of opportunity tonight oh
[1:02:31] i pray that a window will open tonight
[1:02:34] and the end of the law will come here
[1:02:36] and you can take your opportunity
[1:02:38] [Applause]
[1:02:39] [Music]
[1:02:42] glory
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:49] i just got this in the back study just
[1:02:50] now the main neck of gadara
[1:02:53] mark chapter five
[1:02:55] this man that we know
[1:02:57] as legion
[1:02:58] was possessed with demons
[1:03:00] this man was possessed and i'm talking
[1:03:02] about possession
[1:03:04] so the demons control where he lived
[1:03:06] they made him cut himself
[1:03:08] they controlled his tongue because they
[1:03:10] spoke back to jesus
[1:03:11] and anybody who come to tame him he beat
[1:03:13] them down none of his own strength but
[1:03:15] demons
[1:03:17] but the bible says in verse 6 when he
[1:03:19] saw jesus
[1:03:20] hallelujah when he saw that window of
[1:03:23] opportunity
[1:03:24] he ran to jesus christ bob says and
[1:03:28] worship
[1:03:29] how can a man who's demon possessed be
[1:03:31] able to worship
[1:03:32] worship is a one way a two-way channel
[1:03:35] between you and god when you begin to
[1:03:37] worship even if you're demon possessed
[1:03:40] the devil cannot take control of your
[1:03:41] tongue you'll be allowed to say glory to
[1:03:44] god you'll be able to say praise the
[1:03:46] lord because worship is between god and
[1:03:49] the elect
[1:03:50] even if you're demon possessed i don't
[1:03:52] care your situation if you can't do
[1:03:54] worship
[1:03:55] when you see your window of opportunity
[1:03:57] and you begin to worship
[1:03:59] in that window the devil can touch you
[1:04:02] in that window the demons couldn't
[1:04:04] control his tongue in that window they
[1:04:06] couldn't control his legs he was able to
[1:04:09] run down
[1:04:10] worship
[1:04:14] oh hallelujah
[1:04:16] oh my that's so strike me somebody who's
[1:04:19] so demon possessed but when a window of
[1:04:22] worship opens up
[1:04:23] demons cannot control him
[1:04:25] [Applause]
[1:04:28] after he finished worship
[1:04:30] now the demons could able to speak again
[1:04:31] and say what do we have against us jesus
[1:04:34] on the most high they couldn't speak
[1:04:36] while he was worshiping
[1:04:38] they couldn't prevent him from going to
[1:04:39] jesus because he saw his wind of
[1:04:42] opportunity
[1:04:43] oh my
[1:04:44] simply worship
[1:04:46] worship
[1:04:47] worshiping it doesn't matter if you feel
[1:04:50] low it doesn't matter what your
[1:04:52] circumstances are if you're able to
[1:04:54] worship in that window of worship the
[1:04:56] devil cannot catch you
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:01] glory
[1:05:03] oh can we just worship him for a little
[1:05:04] bit tonight
[1:05:06] oh praise the lord
[1:05:08] how worthy he is
[1:05:10] he is worthy to be praised he is worthy
[1:05:12] of everything of adoration of praise of
[1:05:16] glories of hallelujahs
[1:05:19] in this window all the demons that bind
[1:05:21] you have to flee in this window if you
[1:05:24] worship sit and foster your feet in this
[1:05:27] window all things are possible
[1:05:30] hallelujah
[1:05:32] glory
[1:05:36] hallelujah
[1:05:39] hallelujah
[1:05:41] oh
[1:05:42] praise the lord
[1:05:44] hallelujah
[1:05:54] there was a man called simon
[1:05:56] the pharisee who wanted to have jesus
[1:05:58] over for dinner
[1:06:00] he sent his courier
[1:06:02] to go the message for jesus
[1:06:05] and brother branham explains the scene
[1:06:07] so perfectly this man runs
[1:06:09] and he's on his horse perhaps and he's
[1:06:11] running to go see jesus
[1:06:12] and he sees the crowd and he's pushing
[1:06:15] people
[1:06:15] and he's looking for jesus and he says
[1:06:17] maybe peter says sir i have a message
[1:06:19] from my master for your master
[1:06:21] then he goes on to see jesus and say my
[1:06:24] master simon would like to have you over
[1:06:26] for dinner
[1:06:27] jesus says sure
[1:06:29] i'll come jesus keeps all his
[1:06:31] appointments right by him says
[1:06:33] and then he says oh thank you and he's
[1:06:35] so happy
[1:06:37] gets back on his horse riding back to
[1:06:38] his master to say i found jesus he said
[1:06:41] he will be here
[1:06:42] i've done my job
[1:06:44] but i to say what a foolish thing to do
[1:06:46] he was standing before the prince of all
[1:06:50] princes
[1:06:51] and he had an audition with him he had
[1:06:53] an interview with the king of glory and
[1:06:56] failed to seize opportunity
[1:06:59] oh my he didn't catch what his
[1:07:02] opportunity was see he only came to do
[1:07:04] what his master asked him but if he
[1:07:06] recognized who that man was
[1:07:10] perhaps in his own life he would have
[1:07:11] never had a chance to meet jesus but
[1:07:13] because of his master he was able to go
[1:07:16] with a message to jesus that gave him a
[1:07:18] window for his own self perhaps the
[1:07:21] disciples said no you can't touch him
[1:07:22] but because he had a message from his
[1:07:24] master for jesus they let him go then he
[1:07:27] had his window of opportunity and left
[1:07:32] bravo says oh i'd like to take his place
[1:07:35] i'd like to get to jesus sometime i'll
[1:07:37] try i'll try to go daily for your
[1:07:40] troubles but never do i ever leave him
[1:07:43] when i'm in his presence until i worship
[1:07:45] him
[1:07:46] oh my
[1:07:48] i've taken upon myself just something
[1:07:49] between me and the lord when i see the
[1:07:51] back of every service as soon as i begin
[1:07:53] to feel the presence of the lord i say
[1:07:55] welcome
[1:07:56] because when i'm in his presence i have
[1:07:59] to worship when i'm in his presence and
[1:08:02] i recognize that he has descended i have
[1:08:04] to let him know how i feel about him and
[1:08:07] i will never leave the sanctuary or my
[1:08:10] room or wherever i am in the car when i
[1:08:12] feel his presence without worshiping him
[1:08:15] you take every opportunity that you have
[1:08:18] to worship
[1:08:19] to tell him you love him to tell him how
[1:08:22] much it means to you is he here tonight
[1:08:24] then you can tell that you love him
[1:08:29] don't be like that courier who can get
[1:08:31] in the presence of the lord without
[1:08:33] taking some opportunity i don't know
[1:08:35] what tomorrow is i might not be here
[1:08:36] tomorrow but as long as i'm in the
[1:08:38] presence of the lord i would like my
[1:08:39] last deeds my final actions on nerf to
[1:08:42] be the in his presence i worship him
[1:08:46] perhaps you're a senior friend tonight i
[1:08:49] don't know what your situation is but
[1:08:50] even in your sinful condition
[1:08:52] if you're in his presence even if you
[1:08:54] don't feel it i tell you he is here
[1:08:57] because of that you can worship him that
[1:08:59] he can stand for you that day say even
[1:09:01] though he never received the holy ghost
[1:09:03] in my presence he worshipped
[1:09:07] and acknowledged me
[1:09:09] got to acknowledge him
[1:09:14] hallelujah
[1:09:24] salvation is very easy
[1:09:26] it's the story of redemption
[1:09:29] it's a story of windows
[1:09:31] of opportunity
[1:09:32] that every man took
[1:09:34] noah came with the ark and there was a
[1:09:36] door
[1:09:37] god sent the prophet there is a door and
[1:09:39] brad says when you receive the gift the
[1:09:40] god is sent in the day it opens up an
[1:09:43] age of golden opportunity
[1:09:47] but going to hell
[1:09:49] is harder than getting saved
[1:09:52] because for you to be lost it means that
[1:09:54] every window
[1:09:55] of opportunity you rejected
[1:09:58] it's not easy to do that
[1:10:01] everyone says in two days the same thing
[1:10:02] the very same thing we are given the
[1:10:05] opportunity because god cannot judge
[1:10:07] without first having or without first
[1:10:09] giving his warning
[1:10:11] if you told a certain person going down
[1:10:13] the road speeding stop and say there's a
[1:10:16] hole down the road there if you continue
[1:10:18] to speed you'll be killed and they say
[1:10:20] nonsense i know what i'm doing then you
[1:10:22] see the blood can be upon you because
[1:10:25] you have thoroughly warned them
[1:10:30] well god does the same thing by his word
[1:10:33] he thoroughly warns the people of
[1:10:34] uncoming judgment and shows his sign and
[1:10:37] wonders that's predicted in the bible
[1:10:39] for that age he shows them and the
[1:10:42] people just walk right over it
[1:10:44] it's not easy for a person to go to hell
[1:10:46] a man fights his way to hell
[1:10:59] a man fights his way to hell
[1:11:02] the first lie you ever told you know it
[1:11:04] was wrong the first cigarette you ever
[1:11:06] smoked you know that was wrong the first
[1:11:08] evil you did you know that was wrong but
[1:11:11] in your conscious something told you was
[1:11:13] wrong but you continually ran through
[1:11:15] the red light
[1:11:16] ran over the barricades you're reckless
[1:11:20] you want to do it anyhow to show that
[1:11:22] you're some big guy huh see but remember
[1:11:24] you fight your way to hell it is not
[1:11:28] easy to go to hell you have to reject
[1:11:30] truth
[1:11:31] and i'm not preaching hell tonight to
[1:11:32] scare anybody but i'm saying the way to
[1:11:34] hell is more difficult than the way to
[1:11:37] salvation salvation is one opportunity
[1:11:39] you take it hell is rejecting truth over
[1:11:42] and over and over again how many windows
[1:11:45] have you had if you've been raised in
[1:11:47] the church for 20 years i guarantee
[1:11:49] you've had a window at least every
[1:11:51] service how many windows are you
[1:11:54] rejecting to fight your way to hell
[1:12:02] you say that if i was in the date of
[1:12:03] jesus maybe i would have stood for him
[1:12:05] by everyone says that you have a more
[1:12:07] you have more of an opportunity to stand
[1:12:09] for him tonight than you would have back
[1:12:12] in those days because the opposition
[1:12:14] today is greater than it was then you
[1:12:18] say if i was with the disciples and i
[1:12:19] saw jesus christ in the flesh surely i
[1:12:21] would have stood for him but the
[1:12:22] opposition today the forces of hell
[1:12:25] today against the truth are harder there
[1:12:27] are more fierce today than then so if
[1:12:30] you serve god today and stand for him
[1:12:32] today that is a greater opportunity than
[1:12:35] the disciples what you have today is a
[1:12:38] much greater opportunity why won't you
[1:12:41] take it
[1:12:53] can you bring the last slide please
[1:13:09] yes
[1:13:12] these slides are questions
[1:13:16] that i found on on the internet of
[1:13:18] people
[1:13:19] regular people like you and i
[1:13:21] who missed
[1:13:23] an opportunity in their life
[1:13:27] can you all see it
[1:13:28] i'll let you i'll let you read some of
[1:13:30] those questions these are questions
[1:13:32] asked in different websites different
[1:13:33] forums
[1:13:34] of people who miss their opportunities
[1:13:50] can you bring it up here so i can see it
[1:13:51] please
[1:14:00] yep okay thank you
[1:14:03] somebody said how do i deal with the
[1:14:05] regret
[1:14:06] of missing an opportunity
[1:14:08] someone else says how do you overcome
[1:14:10] blaming yourself
[1:14:12] for missed opportunities
[1:14:14] how can i stop regretting for the
[1:14:16] mistakes i did and opportunities i
[1:14:18] missed in the past
[1:14:21] i missed the job opportunity of a
[1:14:22] lifetime three months later and it still
[1:14:24] upsets me
[1:14:26] i also lost all motivations to apply for
[1:14:28] any other job what can help me
[1:14:30] what is the best way forward how do you
[1:14:32] deal with regret and past mistakes in
[1:14:34] life
[1:14:35] what how do i deal what could have been
[1:14:37] and miss opportunities
[1:14:40] how does one make up or cope with the
[1:14:42] loss of a once in a lifetime opportunity
[1:14:45] i have made a mistake and lost a once in
[1:14:47] a lifetime opportunity i don't think
[1:14:49] i'll be able to do anything worth off in
[1:14:51] my life now it sucks what should i do
[1:14:54] these are people
[1:14:55] like you and me
[1:14:57] who had opportunities in life and they
[1:14:59] didn't take it
[1:15:00] and regret
[1:15:01] sets in
[1:15:03] and you don't go posting questions like
[1:15:05] that if you're not actually looking for
[1:15:06] help these are people that don't know
[1:15:08] how to deal with the regret of not
[1:15:11] taking a window of opportunity
[1:15:15] so with missed opportunities in this
[1:15:17] lifetime comes regret self-blame
[1:15:20] depression
[1:15:21] sense of worthlessness deep remorse and
[1:15:23] torment
[1:15:24] but when this life is over
[1:15:26] it's over right
[1:15:28] but when it comes to eternal life
[1:15:30] those regrets will be what will fuel the
[1:15:32] lake of fire
[1:15:35] here are some other questions that some
[1:15:36] characters in the bible would have asked
[1:15:38] if they had the internet
[1:15:40] they're not on the slab show but perhaps
[1:15:42] judas
[1:15:43] after he betrayed jesus
[1:15:45] he logged on his computer and typed i
[1:15:47] was called to be a part of the greatest
[1:15:49] ministry on earth and for 30 pieces of
[1:15:51] silver i sold my soul
[1:15:53] how can i get over it
[1:15:56] that was judas he couldn't get over here
[1:15:58] to kill himself
[1:16:00] cain
[1:16:01] after killing and rejecting god's
[1:16:03] provided way and he had a mark and he
[1:16:05] was gone cast away perhaps he logged on
[1:16:08] his computer and typed i had an
[1:16:10] opportunity to worship god once
[1:16:12] he even told me how to be accepted
[1:16:15] but i couldn't bring myself to obey out
[1:16:17] of pride it's been many years now i
[1:16:20] still see that mark on my forehead to
[1:16:23] remind me of this opportunity i miss how
[1:16:25] do i get over it
[1:16:28] he could never get over it
[1:16:32] i once had a chance to be in the lineage
[1:16:34] of the messiah but i failed to see the
[1:16:37] opportunity of the birthright and i sold
[1:16:39] it to my brother
[1:16:40] because i couldn't see the value of it
[1:16:43] since then all the blessings and
[1:16:44] everything has flown through my brother
[1:16:46] and i just can't stop blaming myself
[1:16:48] what can i do
[1:16:50] perhaps a young rich ruler
[1:16:52] went and typed i was a successful
[1:16:54] investor
[1:16:55] and at a very young age i had an
[1:16:57] incredible portfolio of real estate and
[1:16:59] businesses i had the greatest
[1:17:01] opportunity of my life to invest in the
[1:17:02] policy for eternal life
[1:17:04] the offer came directly from the offer
[1:17:07] of all life and i just couldn't risk my
[1:17:09] other businesses
[1:17:11] since then i've been depressed and
[1:17:13] tormented by this how do i cope with
[1:17:16] this how do i even find motivation to
[1:17:17] keep running my businesses
[1:17:20] he ended up in hell
[1:17:22] now all these men
[1:17:24] if only they could type and perhaps
[1:17:26] express how they felt that's probably
[1:17:27] what they would say
[1:17:29] but the saddest thing is that in hell
[1:17:32] there's remembrance
[1:17:35] and you have no chance at all to repent
[1:17:37] but you remember
[1:17:39] the opportunities you've turned down
[1:17:43] it's one thing to go through those
[1:17:44] questions for a couple of years but it's
[1:17:46] one thing to have to endure them over
[1:17:49] and over and over and over again being
[1:17:52] tormented
[1:17:53] by those windows that closed
[1:17:56] problem says you say unto me then
[1:17:58] preacher says remember us in hell jesus
[1:18:00] said there was
[1:18:01] the rich young man that lifted up his
[1:18:03] eyes he saw abraham and lazarus in his
[1:18:05] bosom and he said
[1:18:07] remember in your lifetime there is
[1:18:09] remembrance and how they lost what an
[1:18:12] awful thing that would be to know that
[1:18:14] the great meetings that they had set in
[1:18:16] and and heard the mighty sermons of the
[1:18:18] unknown ministers of god and not only
[1:18:20] that but to see the anointed signs and
[1:18:22] wonders that god had performed among the
[1:18:24] people and then to remember all these
[1:18:27] warnings and be lost
[1:18:29] it will help them forever
[1:18:32] not only have you seen what god has done
[1:18:34] in this history of prophet you've seen
[1:18:36] what god has been doing in this church
[1:18:38] for the past few weeks you've seen souls
[1:18:40] getting saved you've seen people that
[1:18:42] were dead and sin for years being
[1:18:44] quickened back by the power of god we've
[1:18:46] seen names on our prayer meeting bored
[1:18:48] being affected last being changed you've
[1:18:51] seen it you've had service after service
[1:18:53] you have windows of the windows do not
[1:18:56] take this window tonight it will hunt
[1:18:58] you forever
[1:19:07] there was a woman
[1:19:10] a prostitute in the scripture
[1:19:13] that had her window of opportunity in
[1:19:16] closing
[1:19:19] we heard about the courier will give the
[1:19:20] invitation to jesus christ and he came
[1:19:22] to the feast
[1:19:23] he came to that dinner
[1:19:26] he came with dirty feet
[1:19:28] there's nobody there to welcome him
[1:19:30] nobody there to clean his feet as it was
[1:19:33] custom to do
[1:19:34] nobody there to give him the softest
[1:19:37] slippers as brother banana would say
[1:19:38] nobody there to pour oil upon him to
[1:19:41] to maybe
[1:19:42] help him with the heat against his skin
[1:19:45] and then he went into the house to keep
[1:19:47] his appointment because he was invited
[1:19:49] he was left in a corner and entertained
[1:19:53] jesus keeps all his appointment right
[1:19:55] balaam says you invite him to come
[1:19:57] and then he comes
[1:19:59] but when he comes what do you do
[1:20:02] some have prayed for a move of god in
[1:20:04] the church we have a move of god in the
[1:20:05] church
[1:20:06] what are you doing
[1:20:08] some say that i need a fire of god in
[1:20:10] this church we are the fire god in this
[1:20:11] church they have left
[1:20:13] some say i need to be in the presence of
[1:20:14] the law we need god to move the border
[1:20:16] is open
[1:20:17] you have your opportunity
[1:20:21] now this woman
[1:20:23] just happened to see that jesus was
[1:20:25] there
[1:20:26] now we talk about opportunities being a
[1:20:29] process
[1:20:30] simon was a pharisee who had money
[1:20:34] so when he was born god watched over him
[1:20:38] god help him be successful in life
[1:20:40] god prospered his businesses
[1:20:42] god gave him a name and a reputation
[1:20:44] that he had friends amongst the
[1:20:45] pharisees because god had in mind a
[1:20:48] prostitute
[1:20:51] now that processor bought an alabaster
[1:20:53] box from the store god watched over that
[1:20:55] store owner god gave him the inspiration
[1:20:58] to open his store god prosper his
[1:21:00] business god made him buy inventory so
[1:21:03] he would have alabaster boxes available
[1:21:06] for this woman
[1:21:08] that opportunity that didn't appear out
[1:21:10] of nowhere it was a process in the
[1:21:12] making god prospered this person that
[1:21:15] person brought this one that way to
[1:21:17] bring all the circumstances to be
[1:21:19] aligned so that somebody might have an
[1:21:21] opportunity
[1:21:23] you're not just here by accident
[1:21:26] somebody prayed somebody watched over
[1:21:28] your father somebody watched over your
[1:21:30] mother somebody called brother from
[1:21:31] toronto to be here to open a church here
[1:21:34] somebody called the prophet and the
[1:21:36] messenger and sent him somebody call it
[1:21:38] ministry here tonight somebody put this
[1:21:40] meeting together somebody paid for this
[1:21:42] building somebody inspired this sermon
[1:21:45] somebody pray the prayer you pray
[1:21:47] so that all these circumstances align
[1:21:49] tonight might be a window of opportunity
[1:21:52] for you
[1:21:55] [Music]
[1:21:59] she sees jesus
[1:22:01] by himself in the corner
[1:22:04] and as we talked about an opportunity to
[1:22:06] come to those that are mindful of it so
[1:22:08] no doubt she's thinking no doubt the
[1:22:10] previous day of the last week of the
[1:22:12] last month he's pondered before bed oh
[1:22:14] god
[1:22:16] why am i like this
[1:22:18] why can't i just overcome this
[1:22:21] why can't i get delivered from this
[1:22:22] depression
[1:22:23] why cannot overcome this sin that so
[1:22:25] easily besets me i want to serve you but
[1:22:28] why can i get over this lifestyle
[1:22:30] why can't i bring myself to a full
[1:22:32] surrender why can't i separate myself
[1:22:35] with all worldliness and focus on you
[1:22:37] and she's pondered and pondered why and
[1:22:40] she was mindful because she was mindful
[1:22:43] and opportunity came and when she saw
[1:22:46] jesus she said this is my window
[1:22:49] she ran back home
[1:22:51] she grabbed her little site with money
[1:22:53] she started counting by the way and says
[1:22:54] all the coins and she stopped to say oh
[1:22:56] no he he certainly know how i got this
[1:22:59] money he will certainly know how i got
[1:23:00] this money but i can't go to him without
[1:23:04] anything i have to offer something back
[1:23:05] i have to give my praise i i have to
[1:23:08] show how much it means to me i have to
[1:23:10] show how much i value this opportunity
[1:23:13] that i've been given and i have to do
[1:23:14] something okay it doesn't matter if you
[1:23:17] cast me away then let me cast me away
[1:23:19] but me i have to take this door of
[1:23:21] opportunity or if sinners have that
[1:23:23] attitude i will come to the altar if you
[1:23:25] reject me he rejects me but i will still
[1:23:28] come and take my opportunity
[1:23:31] if i perish i perish well i need to go
[1:23:34] to see the king and take my opportunity
[1:23:37] you don't even need any guarantee that
[1:23:39] jesus will accept you if you accept you
[1:23:41] is by his mercies but he has still given
[1:23:43] you a guarantee in the world that he
[1:23:46] will not cast you away
[1:23:51] and she comes
[1:23:53] to the house of simon
[1:23:55] and simon is having a good time with his
[1:23:57] friends
[1:23:58] you can hear the wine glasses
[1:24:00] they can hear the music and she looks
[1:24:02] for jesus and she sees him in the corner
[1:24:04] by himself
[1:24:06] and she comes to him
[1:24:08] falls down at his feet
[1:24:11] she said all my life
[1:24:13] all my life i've been waiting for this
[1:24:15] opportunity
[1:24:16] i've been waiting for this opportunity
[1:24:18] to be delivered from this spirit
[1:24:21] i've been wanting from this opportunity
[1:24:23] to have my life transformed
[1:24:25] i've been waiting for this opportunity
[1:24:27] to finally surrender my left to christ
[1:24:30] i've been waiting for this opportunity
[1:24:31] to receive my healing
[1:24:33] this was her opportunity
[1:24:35] and she started crying
[1:24:37] and she started weeping
[1:24:39] oh brother branham says
[1:24:41] if jesus had moved one foot
[1:24:44] it would stall her and she would have
[1:24:46] ran out of that place so fast
[1:24:48] so quickly he never moved everyone says
[1:24:51] sometimes he can get out of order he
[1:24:53] will be okay with it he will let you get
[1:24:55] out of order for a little bit and he
[1:24:56] says give us services where people can
[1:24:59] get out of order because jesus will let
[1:25:01] you do it the problem is that we are too
[1:25:03] in order
[1:25:06] he let her do it
[1:25:08] he let her weep he let her cry and she's
[1:25:11] repenting and her tears are speaking
[1:25:14] volume
[1:25:14] oh the bible says our tears are bottled
[1:25:18] he's bottled all our tears and perhaps
[1:25:20] tonight god has in his museum brother
[1:25:22] mike can i fellowship around this
[1:25:23] perhaps in his museum he has a bottle
[1:25:25] and he goes by it and says i remember
[1:25:28] this
[1:25:29] those are the tears of that woman
[1:25:32] when she wept and washed my feet it
[1:25:34] meant so much to him that he bottled her
[1:25:37] tears and brahma says the tears of a
[1:25:39] repenting sinner are precious in his
[1:25:42] sight your tears of repentance are going
[1:25:44] to be bottled up and you will carry they
[1:25:46] say these are the tears of my son when
[1:25:49] he came and surrendered his life to me
[1:25:50] these are the tears of my daughter but
[1:25:52] she was plagued year after year she took
[1:25:55] a win of opportunity
[1:25:57] she wept
[1:25:59] and wept and washed his feet with her
[1:26:01] tears
[1:26:02] and before you know it her hair is
[1:26:04] falling down
[1:26:06] and she starts to dry
[1:26:07] them with her hair and she starts to
[1:26:09] kiss his feet and just worship and say
[1:26:12] lord i'm a sinner
[1:26:14] i'm a sinner but
[1:26:15] you're my opportunity
[1:26:17] whomever in heaven on earth beside me oh
[1:26:20] savior hear my humble cry
[1:26:23] this woman was not the one who invited
[1:26:26] jesus
[1:26:28] simon was the one who invited jesus
[1:26:32] even though somebody else was the one to
[1:26:34] invite him she was able to see an
[1:26:36] opportunity
[1:26:37] you might be a sinner perhaps you didn't
[1:26:39] pray to come to church today and
[1:26:41] somebody else invited christ to come in
[1:26:43] these meetings somebody else prayed on
[1:26:45] worship and invited the lord to come
[1:26:47] back in this meeting and the lord came
[1:26:49] upon somebody else's invitation but that
[1:26:52] doesn't mean that you cannot take
[1:26:54] advantage of that opportunity she was
[1:26:56] not the one who invited the messiah
[1:26:58] simon did but she was able to say
[1:27:01] regardless this is my opportunity
[1:27:04] perhaps you came to church tonight not
[1:27:06] wanting anything about god perhaps you
[1:27:08] didn't care about why you came to church
[1:27:10] but then christ came and you sing in
[1:27:12] your window take it
[1:27:23] now think about this
[1:27:24] what this woman is doing
[1:27:27] is so unusual
[1:27:30] this is a dinner party
[1:27:32] if there's a place to be more conscious
[1:27:35] of what you're doing
[1:27:36] it'll be at a party with dignitaries
[1:27:38] rich people fancy dressed
[1:27:42] that's where you maybe you'll be
[1:27:43] self-conscious what are they gonna think
[1:27:45] about me
[1:27:46] what are they gonna say about me is this
[1:27:48] really the place to do this
[1:27:50] but her she didn't let any of that
[1:27:53] hinder her
[1:27:54] but it's surprising that in church
[1:27:57] we find it unusual to cry unto god where
[1:27:59] are you going to cry at a party
[1:28:01] that's what she did at a dinner party
[1:28:03] she went for repentance this is the most
[1:28:06] prosper this is the most adequate place
[1:28:09] to do what she did she did it at a
[1:28:11] dinner party because you couldn't be in
[1:28:13] church you are in church what better
[1:28:16] place than church than for repenting
[1:28:19] sinners to come what better place than
[1:28:21] church to touch the home of his garment
[1:28:23] and then we think what are people going
[1:28:25] to think about me
[1:28:26] i'll tell you what we're gonna think
[1:28:28] this is normal that's what we're gonna
[1:28:30] think we ought to normalize whipping
[1:28:32] sinners back to calvary
[1:28:36] [Music]
[1:28:37] [Applause]
[1:28:40] [Music]
[1:28:42] came anyhow because he would take any
[1:28:44] place you give him
[1:28:45] he never he never
[1:28:47] complained about being in the corner he
[1:28:49] never complained about being unattended
[1:28:51] he never complained about his dirty feet
[1:28:53] he was happy to come because he was
[1:28:55] invited he will take any place you give
[1:28:58] him
[1:28:59] you may stand tonight and say i accept
[1:29:01] him as my savior he will take that
[1:29:03] you can come to the altar he will take
[1:29:04] that you can decide i'm just going to
[1:29:06] sit in my seat he will take that you can
[1:29:08] say i won't say anything i'll just say
[1:29:10] in my heart he will take that but he
[1:29:12] deserves the best you can give
[1:29:15] so if you can make a public declaration
[1:29:18] that he is your savior that is the best
[1:29:20] you can give him because if you're not
[1:29:22] ashamed of him tonight he will not be
[1:29:24] ashamed of you then
[1:29:25] [Applause]
[1:29:29] jesus sees this woman coming
[1:29:31] and he looks at her he's a prophet and
[1:29:33] he sees this dark shadow over her and
[1:29:35] you know she's a sinner
[1:29:37] vision breaks for if he sees your life
[1:29:39] and is watching but he lets her come she
[1:29:41] weeps she cries she worships she kisses
[1:29:44] his feet then simon gets upset because
[1:29:47] somebody in the church has stood up
[1:29:50] some man gets upset because somebody
[1:29:52] decided to cry out to the lord someone
[1:29:54] gets upset because in the church people
[1:29:56] lift up their hands in worship
[1:29:59] and jesus said
[1:30:00] gives him a parable and say who loveth
[1:30:02] much
[1:30:03] he says i guess to him they forgive the
[1:30:05] most he said you have judge right
[1:30:08] says i came upon your invitation you
[1:30:11] didn't worship me you didn't wash my
[1:30:13] feet you didn't anoint my head with oil
[1:30:16] but this woman says she hasn't stopped
[1:30:19] as he's speaking she is still doing it
[1:30:22] as a preacher is preaching you're still
[1:30:24] doing it in your heart oh god
[1:30:30] and
[1:30:30] jesus turns back to her
[1:30:32] as he was worshiping he's watching her
