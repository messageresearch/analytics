[3:23] Worthy,
[3:24] [Music]
[3:32] worthy
[3:34] lamb
[3:35] that was made.
[3:38] [Music]
[3:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[3:45] How wonderful you are, Lord Jesus.
[3:49] We just want to come into your presence
[3:50] with joy and thanksgiving and worship.
[3:54] We pray that you will bless, oh God,
[3:58] &gt;&gt; every person
[4:00] &gt;&gt; every person in your presence
[4:03] those that are streaming, those that are
[4:04] on the telephone, oh God, whatever
[4:07] country, wherever they may be in
[4:09] whatever time zone, pray that you will
[4:12] bless them immensely, Father. And we
[4:14] that have gathered here, we've not
[4:16] gathered in vain. We've gathered that we
[4:18] might hear the voice of the Holy Spirit.
[4:21] We pray that you will remove every
[4:23] obstacle,
[4:24] remove all the thoughts of this world
[4:26] and this life, oh God, and may in the in
[4:30] uh in uh in your face, oh God, may it
[4:33] just become uh dim. All the things of
[4:36] the world, may they pale, for they are
[4:39] not important. This is an important
[4:42] time, Lord. pray you'll take your word
[4:45] and break it to the people, oh God. Take
[4:47] control of my lips, Father. I dedicate
[4:50] them and surrender myself to you that we
[4:53] might be benefited and edified and built
[4:56] up and prepared for the hour that we're
[4:58] living in. In Jesus name, amen.
[5:03] Hallelujah.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Wonderful to be together this morning.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; Beautiful sunny day. We have to tell the
[5:10] people it's a sunny day.
[5:14] God's been good to us and we're so
[5:16] thankful for it. Amen. Are you
[5:19] rejoicing?
[5:21] &gt;&gt; Good. God bless you. I'm going to go
[5:24] directly to the word because we want to
[5:27] uh take our time and uh we'd like to
[5:30] read just two scriptures. The first one
[5:33] is Hebrews 13:8. And I'm sure that you
[5:36] can all quote it without even having
[5:39] turned to it in the scripture.
[5:45] And the second will be in Ecclesiastes
[5:47] the 3 chapter.
[5:52] Ecclesiastes comes right after Proverbs.
[5:56] So Hebrews 13:8. Let us read it
[5:59] together.
[6:00] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[6:05] and forever. Let's read it again. Jesus
[6:09] Christ the same yesterday,
[6:12] today, and forever.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; And then in Ecclesiastes
[6:19] 3 14 and 15, I know that whatsoever God
[6:25] doeth,
[6:26] it shall be forever.
[6:29] Nothing can be put to it, nor anything
[6:33] taken from it, and God doeth it that men
[6:39] should fear before him. That which hath
[6:43] been is now,
[6:45] and that which is to be hath already
[6:48] been,
[6:50] and God requireth that that which is
[6:53] passed. Amen.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Strange scripture, perhaps strange
[6:59] reading for this morning, but those are
[7:01] those are the scriptures that I have.
[7:05] And you can have your seats. I'm going
[7:07] to
[7:08] uh go immediately to a quote that
[7:11] brother Brandham incorporated and used
[7:13] these two scriptures. And
[7:17] uh
[7:24] this is in the Ephesian church age.
[7:29] He said the
[7:32] the key given me
[7:34] of the Lord whereby I was able to
[7:37] determine the messenger for each age is
[7:41] a most scriptural one. So this is now
[7:45] the the key.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; In fact, it might be called the keystone
[7:51] of the Bible.
[7:53] It is the revelation that God
[7:56] never changes
[7:58] &gt;&gt; and that his ways are as unchangeable as
[8:01] he is.
[8:07] And then the two scriptures which we
[8:09] read,
[8:10] I will just take it again because now
[8:13] that you're seated and and have your
[8:15] spirits quietened,
[8:18] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[8:22] and forever. How many times did the
[8:24] prophet quote that?
[8:27] Why would it be so frequently? Because
[8:30] it was something that we need to be
[8:32] reminded of. It's something that we need
[8:34] to experience.
[8:37] that nothing doesn't nothing changes
[8:39] with him. I know that whatso whatsoever
[8:42] God doeth it shall be forever.
[8:45] Nothing can be put to it nor anything
[8:48] taken from it and God doeth it that men
[8:53] should fear before him. That's why he
[8:55] does it. That which hath been is now,
[8:59] and that which is to be hath already
[9:02] been. and God requireth that which is
[9:06] passed. Amen.
[9:10] Then he goes on this next quote. It's a
[9:14] little bit little bit loud here for me
[9:16] if you don't mind. Thank you.
[9:20] You know, he's going with this keystone
[9:22] thought. Here it is. An unchanging God
[9:26] with unchanging ways.
[9:30] What he did at the first
[9:33] he will have to keep on doing until it
[9:36] is done for the last time.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; There will never be a change. Apply that
[9:43] to the church ages. The kind of man that
[9:46] God chose for the first age and how God
[9:50] manifested in that man's ministry
[9:54] would be the example for all other ages.
[9:57] What God did in the first age is what he
[10:00] wants to do in all other ages.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Now
[10:07] sometimes a person gets up such as I am
[10:10] this morning and just
[10:14] uh feel real confident and what you're
[10:16] going to be saying. But the service this
[10:20] morning will be a little different for
[10:21] me because the key point that I want to
[10:27] bring to you is not something you can
[10:29] just preach, but it's something I want
[10:31] to convey to this congregation.
[10:34] I want to convey to you as a friend, as
[10:38] a servant of Jesus Christ,
[10:41] as uh someone who has I I was reminded a
[10:46] great deal
[10:49] and uh about this and and I I want I
[10:52] hope that you'll receive it right. But
[10:55] I'm I'm going to speak to you today from
[10:57] the perspective from the point of view
[11:00] that for whatever reason
[11:03] and I feel very very unworthy that I was
[11:07] able to experience it. But I did
[11:10] experience the presence of God that I
[11:12] want to talk about today.
[11:14] I'm not talking about anything that
[11:16] perhaps you have experienced. I'm
[11:19] talking about my own personal
[11:20] experience. I'm not talking about a
[11:22] joyous time or wonderful time or a
[11:24] fearful time that you may have had. I
[11:27] think that I would be correct in saying
[11:29] I really do believe sincerely that I'm
[11:31] right in saying
[11:33] people who came into the presence of of
[11:36] the God's prophet,
[11:39] they experienced
[11:41] they experienced something. and he talks
[11:43] quite a bit about it and almost a
[11:46] hundred times he said do you believe me
[11:49] to be God's prophet
[11:51] &gt;&gt; there were there were certain things
[11:53] that needed to be in place
[11:56] uh regarding the presence of God and I
[12:00] wrote in the automobile which many of
[12:02] you have heard I'm not going to go into
[12:04] the account but the presence of that
[12:07] person and I want to speak on
[12:10] recognizing the one amongst us.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Recognizing the one amongst us, I have
[12:17] some key things that I want to say. Some
[12:20] very, very significant things that I
[12:22] want to say to you as a congregation and
[12:25] to those that are believers that are
[12:27] streaming right now.
[12:31] You God has arranged that you are
[12:34] identified with a message
[12:37] that is has been more attested to
[12:43] has been in the constant accompaniment
[12:47] of the almighty supernatural God.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; More so than any message since Adam.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; We have no record in the scripture.
[12:58] We have Elijah who did four miracles.
[13:03] Elisha who did a double portion eight.
[13:07] We have men of God, holy men, patriarchs
[13:11] down through the scripture. We have the
[13:14] life of Jesus Christ, even Jesus Christ
[13:17] himself who raised the dead and did all
[13:20] manner of things in a very localized
[13:23] area which was Palestine.
[13:26] But he did say that greater works than
[13:28] these shall ye do.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; And the greater works he said were could
[13:32] not brother Brandham said could not be
[13:34] greater in in the quality but in the
[13:37] quantity.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; And where there has been no record. It
[13:40] couldn't happen until this age.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Came into the jet age the achievement of
[13:46] of scientific achievement and now this
[13:50] ministry went completely around the
[13:53] world. Amen.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[13:56] seven times around the world. But more
[13:59] than that, more than that, I want you to
[14:03] think real deep about these things. I'm
[14:05] just going to take my I'm just going to
[14:06] talk to you if it's all right. Amen.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; It didn't make any difference where
[14:13] brother Brandham went whether it was in
[14:16] New York or whether it was in Houston or
[14:19] whether it was in Los Angeles or whether
[14:21] it was in Durban South Africa or
[14:23] Johannesburg
[14:25] or whether it was in Bombay India or
[14:28] whether it was in Helsinki Finland that
[14:32] presence of that unseen one was always
[14:35] there. It was from the earliest services
[14:39] until the very last services. And and
[14:42] and and
[14:44] he would say so many times, if I've told
[14:47] you the truth, let him come now and tell
[14:50] the truth to you and confirm the truth.
[14:54] I was in a message uh this last week and
[14:57] I found it very strange. Uh in fact is
[15:00] I'm you know I have it right at the very
[15:03] end of my service today but I probably
[15:06] won't get to it
[15:09] and it is uh in uh confirmation and
[15:12] evidence was the message
[15:15] and brother Branamus finished the
[15:17] service he is now going to
[15:21] uh he's actually going to have an altar
[15:22] call
[15:24] and uh so he said uh how many in the
[15:28] building just now and he stops. Dot dot
[15:32] dot. How many in the building just now?
[15:35] Cuz he'd asked the people to raise their
[15:37] hands, etc. How many in the building
[15:40] just now? And he stopped and he says, I
[15:44] started to make an altar call,
[15:48] but the Holy Spirit stopped me. He said,
[15:52] that's a strange thing.
[15:54] Sure is.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; Said there's something else. He said,
[15:59] now he's talking what the Holy Spirit
[16:01] said to him.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; You haven't given the presence
[16:07] of my confirmation
[16:10] of my presence yet.
[16:14] Stops now. He's going to have an altar
[16:15] call. He's closing a service. And the
[16:18] Holy Spirit stops him and says these
[16:20] words. You haven't given my confirmation
[16:25] &gt;&gt; my confirmation of my presence
[16:29] &gt;&gt; to to prove that I am here.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; And he goes on and immediately
[16:36] uh he goes on and he he he immediately
[16:39] starts and I've just uh uh separated
[16:43] some of these things. Right over here is
[16:45] a colored man sitting here on the front
[16:48] row. He's facing an operation
[16:52] and have you a prayer card? Because he
[16:54] said, "I don't want anybody that has a
[16:56] prayer card to raise their hand." Only
[16:58] those that do not have a prayer card.
[17:00] And every person he called out of the
[17:02] audience, he said, "You do not have a
[17:04] prayer card." Wanted to make sure they
[17:07] confirmed they do not have a prayer
[17:09] card. He said, "You don't have a prayer
[17:11] card. You don't. You don't need one."
[17:15] And he he speaks of a bladder trouble.
[17:17] And you believe that God can heal the
[17:19] bladder trouble. You believe me? That's
[17:23] a fine spirit right there. Do you
[17:27] believe me to be God's prophet or his
[17:30] servant? Excuse me. That stumbles
[17:33] people. Well, it doesn't stumble us.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; You believe it with all your heart. I
[17:40] thank you, sir. That's the way to
[17:43] believe on them that God sent. That's
[17:46] why I said that's a good spirit because
[17:48] the man was the man was his approach was
[17:52] correct and and that's so important. We
[17:55] don't want to sit here and just have a
[17:57] service. I want to say to every man,
[18:00] woman, and child. We want to have the
[18:02] kind of approach where we're not just
[18:04] coming to church, but we're actually
[18:06] entering into a relationship with this
[18:08] one that's amongst us. Because God, what
[18:11] he did at the beginning, he can't
[18:13] change. And the and the and now don't
[18:16] forget don't forget what I'm going to
[18:18] just say here at the beginning. The same
[18:20] God that met Moses was always with
[18:23] Moses.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; And when Moses died, that same one
[18:27] continued to be with the people.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; But they kept referring back to what
[18:32] Moses said, what God said to Moses. And
[18:35] they kept living by that. And that God
[18:38] stayed with them.
[18:40] that God now changed his form and became
[18:43] flesh
[18:44] &gt;&gt; in the body of Jesus Christ.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; And and and Jesus spoke of he that is
[18:50] with me.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; He nothing ever changed from the very
[18:54] beginning from when he was 12 years old
[18:56] speaking to the leaders till the time he
[18:58] resurrected. It was the same God because
[19:01] he was God. But he was manifested in a
[19:04] body. And remember people looked right
[19:06] at him. Some thought he was a teacher.
[19:08] Some thought he was a divider of the of
[19:10] the churches. Some thought he was a
[19:12] troublemaker. And some thought he was
[19:14] God.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; And he actually did all of those things.
[19:18] He did cause a lot of trouble. He did
[19:20] stir up the people. He did do all of
[19:22] those things. And some thought he was
[19:24] Joseph's son, and some thought he was
[19:26] this, and some thought he was that. God
[19:29] didn't change everybody's mind, but
[19:31] there were a few,
[19:32] &gt;&gt; a few that got really what it was. A few
[19:36] had the right approach.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; And he has never changed. What he did
[19:42] there, he still does today.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; And this message which come now to us
[19:47] has come attested to. It's not it's not
[19:50] please don't rank it just with what is
[19:52] labeled the message throughout all the
[19:54] message and the message churches. I I am
[19:57] saying to you because I have felt and
[19:59] sense that presence. I've been in the
[20:01] presence of this prophet of God and the
[20:04] one that was with him,
[20:07] &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord that was with him.
[20:09] And that's why I I've said many times to
[20:12] the people and because it means
[20:13] something very special to me and I'm
[20:15] going to emphasize it today throughout
[20:17] the entire service. If you go and and
[20:20] see a deep call to the deep again and
[20:23] the woman that is standing here and he
[20:25] gets speaking and he gets kind of caught
[20:27] caught away in in what he's speaking to
[20:30] the people and then he turns and he says
[20:33] is this the patient because he was he
[20:35] was in another realm in another world as
[20:39] it were and because he says it often I'm
[20:41] in two worlds at the same time and so he
[20:44] says to the woman he begins to speak to
[20:46] her and when that uh begin to reveal
[20:48] reveal the secret of the heart, the
[20:50] discerning. Now, some people say, "Well,
[20:52] that was the first pull, the second
[20:53] pull." Don't discredit it. That was the
[20:56] supernatural one that was there. He
[20:58] didn't have these powers within himself.
[21:01] He didn't have it. It was God himself
[21:03] who knew. He said, "Who knows that?" He
[21:06] knows. If he knows what has been, he
[21:08] knows what will be. It wasn't his
[21:10] knowledge. It wasn't what he learned.
[21:12] This was God himself.
[21:15] And I want to say to you that God has
[21:18] never left this message.
[21:20] And when you open a message book, when
[21:23] you hear a tape, when you you realize
[21:26] that God uh uh he interrupted your
[21:29] pathway and your direction, when whether
[21:32] you were young or whether you were
[21:33] older, God, whether you were born in a
[21:35] message home, in a home that honors this
[21:38] message, I want to say to you, this
[21:40] supernatural one that caused that woman,
[21:43] she's standing here and and and she she
[21:46] goes to steady herself and puts her hand
[21:49] on the pulpit And he says to her, he
[21:51] knows right away what it is. He says,
[21:54] "That won't hurt you.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; That's not me. That's him."
[21:59] &gt;&gt; And some of these people he was just
[22:01] speaking to. And uh as I was I was
[22:03] reading, he was he was telling them
[22:05] exactly the feeling that was coming over
[22:07] them as they sat back there, sat in
[22:10] another place. And he said, "Now you're
[22:12] feeling a real sweet feeling coming over
[22:14] you." That's because that pillar of fire
[22:17] is standing over you right now. or just
[22:19] think they're having an effect, but they
[22:21] don't even know where the effect is
[22:23] coming from. But until THE PROPHET OF
[22:25] GOD TELLS THEM WHAT kind of effect
[22:26] they're having, I want to say to you
[22:29] today, that's available for us. That's
[22:32] available to you today BECAUSE THAT GOD
[22:34] CANNOT CHANGE.
[22:37] AND THERE ISN'T anyone sitting here.
[22:38] There's no one listening to me this
[22:40] morning. But what has something uh uh an
[22:44] area of your life or an area of your
[22:47] your family or an area something where
[22:50] you have you have a need of a
[22:52] supernatural
[22:54] uh intervention.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; There isn't anyone here that wouldn't
[22:58] SAY, "OH, GOD, I HAVE I HAVE SOMETHING
[23:01] that I'm holding in my heart. I HAVE
[23:03] SOMETHING I'M BRINGING to you OF A SUPER
[23:06] I NEED A SUPERNATURAL INTERVENTION.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, I WOULD BE UNTRUE. I WOULD BE A
[23:13] LIAR IF I WASN'T ABLE TO SAY TO YOU THAT
[23:16] GOD HAS NEVER CHANGED. AND HE WANTS TO
[23:20] HE WANTS TO HAVE THAT KIND OF VISITATION
[23:23] WITH YOU.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WE WANT TO MOVE UP INTO
[23:27] THAT KIND OF SPHERE. AMEN.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE GOD HAS PRIVILEGED YOU, GIVEN
[23:33] YOU SUCH AN HONOR, SUCH A PRIVILEGE THAT
[23:35] YOU WERE IDENTIFIED WITH A SUPERNATURAL
[23:39] MESSAGE
[23:41] &gt;&gt; THAT CAME BUT FROM HEAVEN IN A
[23:43] SUPERNATURAL WAY. CAME ON THE WINGS OF
[23:46] ANGELS, IF YOU WOULD, OPENING THE SEALS,
[23:49] THE MYSTERIES OF THE WORD OF GOD. MEN
[23:52] TODAY BY THE MULTITUDES HAVE NO IDEA
[23:54] WHAT PARTS OF THIS WORD UH important
[23:57] parts of THE SCRIPTURE ARE. AND GOD HAS
[23:59] GIVEN IT TO YOU.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS LAID IT OUT BEFORE YOU.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; It's not JUST A SERIES OF BOOKS. Forget
[24:05] it. And I I I I picked up a book. I
[24:10] said, and the young people sang today,
[24:12] thank you, Brother Ryan and Isaiah, the
[24:16] Caldwell family.
[24:19] I wrote the words down while you were
[24:21] singing.
[24:23] It's more than a story.
[24:28] It's more than some words on a page
[24:31] &gt;&gt; of history.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; What has they didn't know? Of course, no
[24:35] idea what my scripture is going to be.
[24:38] What he has been, he is.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; And what he is, he always will be.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; He's Jesus Christ today,
[24:45] &gt;&gt; yesterday, today, and forever.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what might be impossible
[24:52] for you is not impossible for God.
[24:55] Hallelujah. And we continue to believe
[24:57] for the impossible because we are
[24:59] believers of the impossible. We're
[25:01] believers of the supernatural.
[25:04] [Music]
[25:06] &gt;&gt; And God doesn't have to put on a show
[25:07] for us.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; That's just God. What he does is
[25:10] supernatural.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:15] [Music]
[25:18] It's more than words on a page.
[25:27] Now, if God attested to
[25:32] this message,
[25:36] if he gave proof to this message,
[25:41] it's not just how he visited this person
[25:44] back here,
[25:49] &gt;&gt; this lady that is sitting here.
[25:54] Not just
[25:56] you're from Iowa,
[25:58] he knows where you're from
[26:01] &gt;&gt; because we're not connected just to the
[26:03] words on this page. We're connected to
[26:05] the one who was speaking it.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, you're not just from
[26:12] Iowa, but you're from De Moines.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; And uh your name is Mrs. Wolf.
[26:22] Amen.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; That same God knows your name
[26:25] &gt;&gt; and knows where you're sitting
[26:27] &gt;&gt; at this moment and knows why you're here
[26:31] &gt;&gt; because that one somehow one day touched
[26:34] you
[26:35] &gt;&gt; and something moved within you
[26:38] &gt;&gt; and said THIS IS DIFFERENT. THIS
[26:40] ATMOSPHERE is different. THIS IS NOT
[26:42] JUST A CHURCH. THIS IS NOT JUST A
[26:44] RELIGION. THIS IS A PERSON AND THIS KIND
[26:47] OF GOD I CAN BELIEVE IN. AMEN.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; The one that's amongst us.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Recognizing the one that's amongst us.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; And for those who see it and those who
[27:02] see him as, you know, well, it's a it's
[27:05] a a fine church or it's a fine group of
[27:08] people. That's is what you'll get. And
[27:11] furthermore, and I'm going to speak some
[27:14] things that I don't fully understand.
[27:16] Brother abandon has people come up and
[27:19] they're they come right into that
[27:20] presence and he says, "Now it depends
[27:23] what you think it is."
[27:26] &gt;&gt; If you think that this is the devil,
[27:29] &gt;&gt; you will get his reward.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; If you think it's of God, you will get
[27:35] his reward.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Can you imagine two
[27:41] things, two uh consequences from the
[27:45] same moment?
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; At the in front of the same person,
[27:50] &gt;&gt; he says, "If you think it's of Satan,
[27:52] you'll get his reward." He said, "If you
[27:54] think it is like the Pharisees thought
[27:56] it is, you'll get their reward.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; But if you think it is of God, you think
[28:01] this is God, you'll get his reward.
[28:04] [Applause]
[28:06] Amen.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; So I emphasize again of all the
[28:16] ministries that God has sent
[28:19] and somebody if you're nervous about
[28:24] say well
[28:26] we don't want to make too much of a man.
[28:28] Don't worry
[28:30] &gt;&gt; God raised brother Brandham up a lot
[28:31] higher than you ever can.
[28:37] He gave him the highest position
[28:40] &gt;&gt; in this entire age. And there won't be
[28:42] another one like it.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm interested in the one that sent
[28:49] him.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Some people draw from this message. Now,
[28:58] I'm going to get right home where people
[29:00] live.
[29:02] Some people draw from this message and
[29:04] they obtain a higher standard of
[29:06] Christian living,
[29:10] a code of ethics, a standard of morals.
[29:14] They dress different
[29:17] and perhaps live different
[29:20] and that's good. That's not what I'm
[29:22] talking about.
[29:25] Some go perhaps a little further and
[29:28] they they absorb uh and retain a
[29:32] collection of of truths out of the
[29:35] scripture.
[29:37] Uh perhaps even get baptized in the name
[29:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ because they
[29:42] see it in the scripture. Brother Bram
[29:44] said it doesn't even take a revelation.
[29:46] They just see it in the scripture.
[29:48] That's what it says. That's what I'm
[29:49] going to do.
[29:51] And uh and there are truths and loose
[29:53] ends. And I've I've run into people.
[29:56] I've spoken to them and they they
[29:58] believe the message because they said,
[29:59] "Well, it it it confirms what they have
[30:01] always believed. They haven't got it."
[30:04] &gt;&gt; That's not what we're talking about.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; God isn't coming to give a revelation
[30:09] because you already have it.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; He's coming here to tell us things that
[30:13] we don't know.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; And so there's there's uh but there are
[30:21] a few that take all of the above. They
[30:26] have a better code of ethics. They have
[30:27] a higher moral standard. They they have
[30:30] better homes because of it. They have a
[30:32] better life. They have a better work
[30:34] ethic as well. It does all of those
[30:36] things. It is truths that have loose
[30:39] ends of the of the scripture that others
[30:42] can't answer. All of that comes they
[30:44] they obtain all of that. But there are a
[30:47] few
[30:52] that diligently
[30:55] seek out
[30:58] the author who spoke these things.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; The one who did the supernatural, the
[31:07] supernatural one. And I can tell you, I
[31:11] tell you in all truth, he can be felt.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; He can be experienced.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; And you can enter into a relationship
[31:21] with this one
[31:22] &gt;&gt; that will make your little world
[31:25] &gt;&gt; just
[31:27] pale away.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; This world. And I believe my wife and I,
[31:33] my wife was speaking to me while we were
[31:35] coming. She said, and this is her
[31:37] desire,
[31:39] and and I don't mind saying it.
[31:42] She said, "I feel that we're moving so
[31:46] close to the resurrection."
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; I want to separate myself from all of
[31:52] these little things that we can become
[31:55] so cluttered up with and taken with
[31:58] &gt;&gt; and occupied with. Now, we spoke of you
[32:02] young mothers that have children. But
[32:04] while you're caring for your children,
[32:06] that's a spiritual work.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; And you wives that are caring for your
[32:11] home and your husband and so those
[32:13] things, that's a spiritual work because
[32:16] it's here in the word of God. But you
[32:18] can go beyond that and enter into a a a
[32:22] a relationship
[32:25] with this person who sent this message
[32:29] and made you what you are and made this
[32:32] church what it is. And if there is an
[32:35] elect and God has and and uh uh brother
[32:38] Toby while he was praying we are the
[32:40] elect of God. It can only be that
[32:42] because someone supernatural has come
[32:45] and already said that.
[32:47] Because someone caused that prophet's
[32:49] voice to say, "I'll call you bride." We
[32:52] couldn't even do it ourselves, but he
[32:54] said it.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; And because that came from another realm
[32:58] as God coming from the throne of God.
[33:00] Think friends what what we should be how
[33:03] we should be feeling, how we should be
[33:05] reacting to this.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Is this making any sense to you?
[33:10] Amen.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; There are those that are hungering for
[33:15] the presence of the bridegroom
[33:17] &gt;&gt; and thus they live in a different realm.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; It's more than an association here in a
[33:26] church.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; It's got to be much more than just a
[33:30] fellowship or association in the church.
[33:32] That that that's just some of the side
[33:34] benefit. But the real benefit is that
[33:36] you have a relationship and association
[33:39] with this supernatural being,
[33:41] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. The same
[33:43] yesterday, today, and forever. He was
[33:46] felt back then. I think of I think of
[33:49] Peter. I'm thinking of him just now when
[33:51] he he had seen the miracles. He was he
[33:54] had already been identified. He was one
[33:56] that was with as Jesus said, "You'll sit
[33:58] on 12 thrones. You've been with me in
[34:01] the in the regeneration." And yet when
[34:04] Peter and caught that load of fish, he
[34:07] fell down at his feet and said to depart
[34:09] from me. I'm a sinful man.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; The prophet Isaiah, oh woe is me. He
[34:16] said, "Woe is me." When he came into
[34:19] that presence and friends, that's
[34:21] available. That's not just something
[34:22] that that God is promising us some pie
[34:25] in the sky up in the future. that
[34:27] presence. God knows the kind of uh the
[34:30] kind of people we have to walk around
[34:31] and and the age that we're living in and
[34:34] the uncleanness of this age and the EVIL
[34:37] OF THIS AGE. BUT THERE'S A SACRED PLACE.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; There's a place for the believer.
[34:44] THERE'S A SACRED PLACE FOR YOU TO ENTER
[34:46] INTO. When the scripture speaks about
[34:48] we're in HEAVENLY PLACES, YOUR BODY IS
[34:51] HERE WALKING HERE, but your soul is in
[34:53] another realm.
[34:56] YOUR SOUL HAS BEEN MADE FOR THIS.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; The presence of God
[35:05] is absolutely essential for the
[35:07] supernatural to happen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Every person under the sound of my voice
[35:14] needs the supernatural somewhere today.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; In their life or in their experience.
[35:23] If we could only understand and believe
[35:26] that God is present to do what we desire
[35:29] from him.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; I've been impressed by the Holy Spirit
[35:33] &gt;&gt; that although God has changed in his
[35:37] form from time to time,
[35:39] &gt;&gt; he had certain forms. He had certain say
[35:41] with the pillar of fire, the burning
[35:43] bush.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; They never went back and made anything.
[35:47] Nobody, no one of the children of Israel
[35:49] SAID, "WELL, LET I WANT TO go back and
[35:51] visit the spot where the burning bush
[35:54] was."
[35:55] &gt;&gt; It didn't mean anything. It was just God
[35:57] that spoke to him there and and and
[36:00] visited him there. And it was it was
[36:02] passed from then on.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; But but that symbolized it symbolized
[36:08] and when Moses went and told them, "I
[36:10] met I met the angel of the Lord. God
[36:12] spoke to me out of a burning fire, out
[36:15] of a burning BUSH THAT WOULDN'T THEY HAD
[36:17] TO BELIEVE HIM.
[36:19] [Music]
[36:20] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NOBODY THERE TO confirm it and
[36:22] attest to it and help them through their
[36:24] unbelief. They had to believe
[36:27] &gt;&gt; and then when they believed and then
[36:29] they were able to enter into and
[36:31] participate in the in the miracles and
[36:34] the and THEN THE THE PLAGUES MEANT
[36:36] SOMETHING TO THEM. THEY WERE ON ONE side
[36:38] of the plagues. The Egyptians were on
[36:39] the other side of the plagues. It meant
[36:42] different thing. There was people that
[36:44] totally there was magicians there that
[36:46] you know did their did their uh did
[36:49] their thing and and swayed their people.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[36:57] &gt;&gt; But God never ever left.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:02] Moses
[37:05] &gt;&gt; met him up in a mountain and God himself
[37:09] remember now Moses had to write this
[37:12] &gt;&gt; that there was no man like Moses
[37:15] &gt;&gt; he had to write THAT
[37:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SAID it
[37:21] &gt;&gt; he said as he's the MEAKEST MAN IN ALL
[37:23] THE EARTH.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; MOSES HAD TO WRITE that
[37:26] &gt;&gt; and the people had to believe it. HE HAD
[37:29] TO SAY IT OF HIMSELF
[37:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD was saying it.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; And when a prophet in this day here
[37:40] because it's such an unbelieving and
[37:42] such a a a high state of of of
[37:47] civilization that God allowed THE CAMERA
[37:50] TO CATCH the picture of it. Amen.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed that we're that we needed so
[37:55] much evidence
[37:57] &gt;&gt; and we have the pillar of fire over the
[37:59] prophet's head in public
[38:02] &gt;&gt; IN HOUSTON, TEXAS
[38:04] &gt;&gt; AT THE SAM HOUSTON COLISEUM. WHAT AN
[38:07] UNBELIEVING GENERATION.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; AND NO WONDER THE PROPHET COULD SAY IT
[38:11] WAS PROPHETIC WHEN JESUS SAID, "A WICKED
[38:14] AND ADULTEROUS GENERATION SEEKE ASTH."
[38:17] AND HE SAID, "THERE'LL ONLY BE ONE SIGN
[38:19] GIVEN." AND I I I listened to it several
[38:22] times. Heard him say it several times
[38:25] just in the message I was listening to
[38:27] and and reading. And he said that the
[38:30] the a wicked and adulterous GENERATION.
[38:32] HE SAID HE WAS SAYING IT IN A PROPHETIC
[38:35] WAY BECAUSE HE SAID IT'S THIS GENERATION
[38:38] NOT THAT GENERATION. This generation is
[38:40] the wicked and adulterous generation
[38:43] that seeketh a sign. And he said, Jesus
[38:45] said, "The only sign to be given will be
[38:47] the one of Jonah as he was three days in
[38:50] in the whale's belly,
[38:53] &gt;&gt; the belly of the fish, the whale."
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Well, when he came out, what was it?
[38:58] What was the evidence? It was the It was
[39:01] the resurrection.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's the sign. This is
[39:07] the sign of the resurrection." He said
[39:10] it plainly. Listen to me, people. You're
[39:12] living. YOU HAVE ALREADY COME. YOU'VE
[39:14] BEEN CALLED UNDER THE SIGN OF THE
[39:17] RESURRECTION.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; People talk about YOUR SIGN IN THE in in
[39:21] in the heavens and the stars and all the
[39:24] rest of it. I'll tell you, you came
[39:26] under a star.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; You came under a messenger star.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; AND YOU YOUR SIGN is the resurrection.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I say
[39:40] [Applause]
[39:41] &gt;&gt; and the ONE WHO WAS RESURRECTED BACK
[39:43] THERE IS THE SAME ONE WHO'S PRESENT. HE
[39:46] CAN'T CHANGE.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; HE CAME OUT OF THE TOMB, BUT HE'S HERE
[39:50] TODAY AT THIS PLATFORM.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE STANDING BY YOUR SEAT.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD, I'M NOT JUST going
[39:58] back. When we when we refer back, we're
[40:00] calling it as though it was yesterday or
[40:02] five minutes ago. And he SAYS, "NOW,
[40:05] WE'LL TALK TO THE PEOPLE ON THE COURTS.
[40:08] THERE'S A WOMAN, A YOUNG WOMAN. THERE'S
[40:09] A WOMAN said there and a young young
[40:11] person in that court."
[40:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "AND NOW AT THIS MOMENT, the
[40:16] angel of THE LORD IS STANDING BESIDE
[40:19] HER."
[40:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; AND THEN WHAT'S HE SAY? GET UP OFF THAT
[40:25] C.
[40:27] AND AND AND SHE HE SAID, "I I BELIEVE
[40:30] THAT I would obey that
[40:33] &gt;&gt; cuz she wasn't getting up off that c."
[40:36] I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. GET UP OFF THAT C.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, FRIENDS, WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT
[40:45] IT IS A SUPERNATURAL GOSPEL, THERE'S A
[40:47] SUPERNATURAL MESSAGE. IT'S A
[40:49] SUPERNATURAL PROPHET, A SUPERNATURAL GOD
[40:52] WITH THE PROPHET. I SAY TODAY I WANT TO
[40:54] GO ON RECORD THAT GOD HAS NEVER CHANGED.
[40:58] THAT GOD IS JUST AS PRESENT HERE NOW IF
[41:02] YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; AND YOU NEED A SUPERNATURAL GOD. YOU
[41:09] NEED HIM TODAY AND YOU'LL NEED HIM
[41:11] TOMORROW. AND I'M DECLARING HE'LL BE THE
[41:14] SAME TOMORROW THAT HE IS TODAY.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; We need him.
[41:21] AND THERE'S A CERTAIN APPROACH TO HIM.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; IT CAN'T JUST BE SOME INFORMATION IN THE
[41:26] SERMON YOU'RE listening to. THERE'S A
[41:27] CERTAIN APPROACH.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; AND I CAN TELL YOU, YOU CAN'T JUST SAY,
[41:31] "WELL, I'LL TAKE FIVE MINUTES, LORD, I
[41:33] HOPE you got an instant response here."
[41:36] That's not what he does. THIS ISN'T A
[41:38] PUSH BUTTON GOSPEL.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; This is a gospel WHERE A PERSON SETS
[41:43] THEMSELVES ASIDE AND SAY, "I'M HERE TO
[41:46] LISTEN TO YOU, OH GOD. I'M HERE TO HEAR
[41:49] YOUR VOICE. I'M HERE TO SHUT OUT THE
[41:52] WORLD.
[41:53] [Applause]
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; If we could only recognize, that's
[42:05] number one. Amen. If
[42:06] &gt;&gt; we could only recognize
[42:10] who it is
[42:12] &gt;&gt; and number two, then separate ourselves
[42:15] &gt;&gt; from the world until number three,
[42:19] we approach God and come into a
[42:22] relationship with him.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; And the rest will be irrelevant.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Those steps need to be taken.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I would like to think that this
[42:33] year
[42:34] &gt;&gt; will be a different year
[42:37] &gt;&gt; for all of us.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; I would like to think that this year
[42:43] &gt;&gt; than we would experience. Just think if
[42:45] we took another breath
[42:47] &gt;&gt; if we took ANOTHER BREATH
[42:49] &gt;&gt; AND PASSED INTO another realm.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; And knew KNEW THAT WE WERE BEYOND
[42:56] TEMPTATION. BEYOND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
[42:58] GO BACK TO WORK. YOU'RE GOING TO A
[43:01] MARRIAGE SUPPER.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; WE LOOKED AT THE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS
[43:05] TODAY AND THE AND the the the snow and
[43:09] the SUN ON THEM SHINING ON THEM AND HOW
[43:11] MAGNIFICENT. AND MY WORD, MY THOUGHT
[43:13] IMMEDIATELY GOES BACK TO THE PROPHET. HE
[43:15] SAYS, "WELL, HE MADE THE MOUNTAINS AND
[43:17] HE made the deserts in Arizona and
[43:19] Nevada and wherever. He made all of THAT
[43:22] BECAUSE HE'S A GOD of variety. AND THE
[43:25] PLACE THAT HE'S PREPARING FOR YOU WILL
[43:27] BE JUST SUITED TO THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[43:29] CHRIST. JUST THINK OF IT. HE'S MADE A
[43:31] PLACE SUITED FOR YOU.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; THIS THING'S A REALITY, FRIENDS. THIS
[43:36] MARRIAGE SUPPER IS NOT JUST A PHRASE.
[43:39] IT'S A REALITY. AND THE SUPERNATURAL GOD
[43:42] THAT BROUGHT THIS SUPERNATURAL MESSAGE
[43:44] IS THE ONE THAT'S PREPARED THE PLACE FOR
[43:47] US.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; WE'RE ON OUR WAY.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; You're on your way.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[43:57] Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; If we could only recognize it.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus said this. If you abide
[44:04] in me and my words abide in you,
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; You shall ask what you will
[44:10] &gt;&gt; and it shall be done unto you.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't say that's good for now
[44:15] &gt;&gt; or that was good in the past. If you
[44:17] abide in me and my words abide in you,
[44:21] &gt;&gt; you'll ask what you will and it shall be
[44:24] done to you.
[44:26] I was going back
[44:30] in my thoughts
[44:32] kind of how this all had to take place
[44:34] like this. The Bible tells us that Adam
[44:39] and Eve and the beginning there always
[44:41] has to be a beginning.
[44:44] And Adam and Eve and they said they
[44:45] heard the voice of the Lord God walking
[44:48] in the garden
[44:50] in the cool of the day. And Adam and his
[44:54] wife hid themselves from the presence of
[44:57] the Lord God amongst the trees of the
[45:00] garden. In verse 24 of that third
[45:03] chapter says, "So he drove he drove them
[45:06] out he drove out the man and he placed
[45:11] at the east of the garden of the e of
[45:13] Eden cherubams and a flaming sword which
[45:17] turned every way to keep the way of the
[45:20] tree of life." when they had to depart
[45:23] from the presence of God.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that the cherubams were
[45:28] there to protect the way of the tree.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; We know that the tree was Christ.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; They weren't there to protect Christ.
[45:36] They were there to protect the way.
[45:39] Adam, Eve, and in civilization lost the
[45:43] way. And that is why we need a
[45:46] supernatural God because there isn't
[45:48] Look at all of those people that come
[45:50] before the prophet of God. They had lost
[45:52] their way. They didn't know what to do.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; They didn't Some of them didn't know
[45:57] what was wrong with them. Some of them
[45:59] didn't know what to do and and he has
[46:02] one woman in front of him and he says,
[46:04] "You're thinking about a divorce." He
[46:07] just told her what to she didn't know
[46:09] what to do. and he and he he doesn't
[46:11] tell her what to do, but he tells her
[46:13] what she's thinking about. Other people
[46:16] said, "Should I have an operation?"
[46:18] Other people said they're burdened for
[46:20] their their family, their daughter,
[46:22] their son. One one woman stands there
[46:25] and he says, "You I see an older I see
[46:28] an elder woman, an elderly woman now, as
[46:32] comes into view. And that elderly woman
[46:34] is your grandmother." And then he says,
[46:37] "And I say another woman, that's your
[46:39] mother, and she's here in the meeting."
[46:42] Well, WHAT KIND OF GOD IS THAT? THAT'S
[46:44] THE KIND OF GOD I SERVE.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; I WOULDN'T BE HERE AT THE PULPIT IF WE
[46:48] DIDN'T have that KIND OF GOD. HE KNOWS
[46:51] EVERY DETAIL. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOUR
[46:53] MOTHER. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOUR
[46:55] GRANDMOTHER. HE KNOWS ABOUT YOUR
[46:57] CHILDREN. HE KNOWS ABOUT THE SAVED ONES
[46:59] AND THE BACKSLIDEN ONES. HE KNOWS ABOUT
[47:02] IT ALL. HE KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE AT. HE
[47:04] KNOWS WHAT THE SOLUTION IS TO YOUR
[47:06] PROBLEM AND HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT IT.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT SOME DISTANT GOD UP THERE. HE'S
[47:12] A GOD DOWN HERE.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; HE'S A GOD WHO'S INTERESTED IN YOU.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; HE'S INTERESTED IN YOU. YOUNG PEOPLE
[47:19] DON'T SIT THERE AND THINK, "I DON'T KNOW
[47:21] WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT." I'VE BEEN THERE,
[47:23] TOO.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN A TEENAGER. JESUS WAS A
[47:27] TEENAGER. HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT. AND
[47:29] HE'S JUST AS INTERESTED IN YOU TODAY AS
[47:32] HE WAS BACK THEN. AMEN.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; OR ANY OTHER TIME.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; So they went out of Eden and departed
[47:43] from his presence. And the entire scope
[47:46] of the scripture is a record of God
[47:49] seeking to bring man back into his
[47:52] presence
[47:53] &gt;&gt; and to have that relationship
[47:56] and have it restored once again. And
[47:58] that's why Jesus Christ, the second
[48:00] Adam, came. But even then when he CAME
[48:04] IT WAS AVAILABLE TO THEM LIKE IT'S
[48:06] AVAILABLE TO US TODAY.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; But you know we have
[48:15] we have our own thoughts about things
[48:17] and what we think it is.
[48:20] And I say what's the message? Well, you
[48:23] say the message to some, well, they
[48:24] think of it as a church or they think of
[48:27] it as a group of churches or they think
[48:29] of it as whatever. They think about this
[48:33] church. And no, that that this is just a
[48:36] building.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; The message is people.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; The word of God is people
[48:44] &gt;&gt; who are to have a supernatural
[48:45] experience with a supernatural God.
[48:52] So God has been tireless
[48:55] in providing supernatural works to show
[48:58] us the way back and bring us into his
[49:01] presence. For in his presence, the
[49:03] supernatural is happening.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; If you come into his presence, the
[49:08] supernatural is happening. If you or I
[49:11] have a need of anything, if we do need
[49:15] anything, we are in need of his
[49:16] presence.
[49:20] The word presence
[49:23] is the same as face. In fact, it's face
[49:27] in the Bible. Presence is the face.
[49:32] Now,
[49:34] brother John, I'll just have you come up
[49:35] here for a moment
[49:38] and you face that way.
[49:42] John, I like to say something to you.
[49:45] John.
[49:48] John, I kind of like to get acquainted
[49:50] with you.
[49:54] Boy, this isn't working.
[49:57] If you'd turn around,
[50:01] I see your face.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; I look in your eyes. I can take your
[50:06] hand. Shake your hand. We enter into a
[50:10] relationship.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; That's God's problem.
[50:14] trying to get people or so.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Look up, son. Look up, son. It's not
[50:18] down here. It's not all this dust. Thank
[50:21] you, brother John. It's not all these
[50:23] things and all this stuff you're all
[50:25] occupied with. IT'S LOOK UP.
[50:29] LOOK AT MY FACE.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; AND YOU LOOK AT HIS FACE AND YOU COME
[50:33] INTO HIS PRESENCE AND OH, SOMETHING
[50:37] TAKES A HOLD OF YOU. YOU LOOK INTO HIS
[50:39] EYES. LOOK INTO THAT FACE OF JESUS
[50:42] CHRIST. THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND
[50:46] TOMORROW, AND FOREVER.
[50:49] [Applause]
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And that's why the word in the scripture
[50:53] is exactly the same. The presence, his
[50:57] presence is his face or in the presence
[51:00] of a person. His
[51:04] presence in the Bible identifies his
[51:06] most essential
[51:09] character
[51:11] &gt;&gt; of himself.
[51:13] Just remember some of these things I'm
[51:15] saying. I'm not I'm not going to enlarge
[51:18] on them. I I want to give them to you as
[51:21] they have been given to me. The face of
[51:24] God and the presence of God
[51:27] in the Bible are inseparably linked
[51:29] together. the face of God and the
[51:32] presence of God.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; To see one's face is to see the person.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; God's relationship with Adam began with
[51:42] creation. He had a relationship. Wasn't
[51:45] just that he made a man said, you know,
[51:47] there go take care of the garden. But it
[51:50] entered into a relationship and God came
[51:52] in the cool of the evening and they had
[51:54] fellowship.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; That was the big part. Right.
[52:00] This relationship was soon affected by
[52:02] the fall
[52:04] in the cool of the evening. He said,
[52:06] "What the message? What is the Holy
[52:07] Ghost given for?"
[52:10] He'd come down and commune with them.
[52:14] And there he lost that fellowship
[52:16] because sin would not let him do it.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he was made flesh and
[52:21] dwelt among us in order that he could
[52:24] come back again to a man and live in man
[52:28] &gt;&gt; and restore man to a state of communion
[52:31] with him again.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Not just some words.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in the supernatural one
[52:40] that had these words penned.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. had these words spoken
[52:46] &gt;&gt; so that we could when when we look at
[52:49] the words as they sang more than words
[52:53] on a page.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; How is it more? It's a person.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; It's a person.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; AND THIS ISN'T EVEN SUFFICIENT FOR US TO
[53:02] USE THE WORD THAT IT'S A PERSON. YOU
[53:05] NEED TO REACH OUT DURING THIS SERVICE AT
[53:07] THIS MOMENT AND SAY GOD OF THIS WORD.
[53:12] AMEN.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; I'M HUNGERING FOR YOU. I HAVE BEEN
[53:16] HUNGERING. THE HUNGER AND THE THIRST IS
[53:18] BEING AWAKENED AGAIN. IT'S BEEN CLOUDED
[53:21] OVER. IT'S BEEN CROWDED OUT. I'VE HAD
[53:24] ALL KINDS OF DISTRACTIONS.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; YOU HAD DISTRACTIONS
[53:29] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SATAN IS AN EXPERT DISTRACTOR.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; And he HE LIES TO YOU.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Do you HEAR ME?
[53:37] &gt;&gt; HE LIES TO YOU. HE LIES TO ME AND TELLS
[53:40] ME THESE THINGS ARE UNAVAILABLE AND I
[53:42] CAN'T REACH THROUGH AND I CAN'T
[53:44] PENETRATE. HE'S TOLD SOME PEOPLE THERE'S
[53:46] NO USE. TELL HIM HE'S A LIAR.
[53:50] TELL HIM HE'S A LIAR TODAY.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN REACH THROUGH.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; AND THAT GOD IS AVAILABLE TO YOU. HE
[53:58] WANTS TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU.
[54:01] [Music]
[54:03] &gt;&gt; THIS WORLD IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO IT. AND
[54:05] YOU WALK OUT THESE DOORS AND GO INTO A
[54:07] RESTAURANT, YOU'LL BE HEARING MUSIC.
[54:09] IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE MUSIC ISN'T
[54:11] CONDUCIVE. YOU'LL SEE WAITRESSES AND
[54:14] WAITERS AND WHATEVER MORE COMING YOUR
[54:16] WAY AND YOU'LL HEAR CONVERSATION. IT'S
[54:18] NOT CONDUCIVE. THIS IS THE ATMOSPHERE.
[54:21] LAY HOLD OF IT NOW.
[54:24] [Applause]
[54:31] References in the Bible to the presence
[54:34] of God are the same as to the face of
[54:37] God. And when you're in the presence of
[54:39] a person for the purpose of friendship
[54:42] or communion with them, you expect to be
[54:45] face to face.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Friends, I can get into swimming water
[54:50] with you real quick.
[54:53] Brother Brandham describes the seven
[54:55] personages
[54:57] of Jesus Christ
[54:59] in Revelation chapter 1. And remember,
[55:03] it's the only book in the Bible that was
[55:05] written by Jesus Christ.
[55:08] It's the revelation of Jesus Christ. I
[55:12] Jesus,
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[55:13] &gt;&gt; sent my messenger, my angel, and he gave
[55:16] and it was Jesus Christ that gave the
[55:18] messages to each of the messengers.
[55:25] The last there are seven for the seven
[55:29] ages. The last description of him was
[55:34] not his feet,
[55:37] was not his robe,
[55:39] was not his hair white, was not his eyes
[55:43] as a flame of fire. It was his face.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; It was his face, folks. Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Because he's telling you clearly from
[55:55] the scripture telling you that the last
[55:58] age he's making himself known
[56:01] [Music]
[56:02] &gt;&gt; TO YOU PERSONALLY
[56:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT JUST A A AN
[56:07] ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOU.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T WANT JUST FELLOWSHIP WITH
[56:11] YOU. HE HAS COME NOW TO BE A BRIDEGROOM
[56:14] AND TO ENTER INTO A RELATIONSHIP AND
[56:16] BECOME A HUSBAND
[56:19] &gt;&gt; TO A BRIDE.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; You're looking at me.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Some may be saying, "I I I I believe
[56:29] that. I've heard that before. Those are
[56:31] Don't let them just be words."
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; It's a person.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; He wants to enter into that relationship
[56:37] with you.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Go out when you're going out of these
[56:40] doors. It can even be more real then
[56:43] than it is perhaps even now.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; When you're alone,
[56:47] &gt;&gt; when you're in your room, when you're in
[56:49] your car,
[56:50] &gt;&gt; whatever it is,
[56:52] &gt;&gt; you can isolate yourself.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; LET THE WORLD GO BY. ISOLATE YOURSELF.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; ENTER INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP. EVEN YOU
[57:00] CAN BE AROUND PEOPLE, BUT YOU CAN
[57:02] ISOLATE YOURSELF. YEAH.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; You know, some years ago,
[57:09] I was in Toronto
[57:12] and uh the one of the main radio
[57:15] stations, I think it was the Canadian
[57:17] broadcasting, I'm not too sure,
[57:20] but they had a program that someone just
[57:24] got, you know, caught some kind of
[57:25] inspiration, thought they'll have this
[57:27] program and they will cater the program
[57:30] and and open up the lines
[57:33] for lonely people, people that are
[57:36] troubled with loneliness.
[57:40] And the phones rang off the wall.
[57:43] And they listened to people
[57:46] and the people told about how lonely
[57:49] they were, how alone they were in a city
[57:53] of three million people.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; I'm so alone.
[57:59] Uh, and the effect of that loneliness
[58:02] and it was it was painful.
[58:06] You know what I'm talking about.
[58:09] You can be in a crowded of a church.
[58:13] You can have people shake your hand
[58:14] after the service, but somehow you feel
[58:19] so alone. Well, by the by the same
[58:22] token, you can be alone with him
[58:27] &gt;&gt; in the same way. In exactly the same
[58:29] way, you just move into another realm.
[58:33] It's fine. I'm I'm a I'm I'm separated
[58:35] from the world. It's fine that I don't
[58:37] feel connected to this world. It's fine.
[58:40] I don't feel connected to this
[58:41] classroom. In fact, is I'm not even
[58:44] swallowed up by this achievement or my
[58:46] job or whatever more or or things come
[58:49] or things go. And you get a promotion,
[58:51] you get more money, you get less money.
[58:53] It doesn't make any difference.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; You hear me? Doesn't make any difference
[58:58] because you're shut in with God. That's
[59:00] what they're talking about. That's what
[59:01] the songwriter is talking about. Into a
[59:04] secret place, into a secret chamber
[59:07] because you're the only one that's you
[59:08] and God.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; You and the supernatural one.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; I hope it's ringing.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; I hope it's hitting some strings in your
[59:19] heart.
[59:24] Adam, he lost his way. So he drove him
[59:27] out to keep the way of the tree of life.
[59:30] He lost his way. He lost the way of the
[59:32] tree of life. And we become so
[59:34] acquainted with the ways of the world.
[59:37] We truly have what's acceptable by the
[59:39] world. Well, they do it and someone else
[59:41] does it. I'm not interested who does it.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested what someone else
[59:47] does or another church does or anything
[59:48] else. What does God want you to do?
[59:51] Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Do you think that God would prefer that
[59:54] you would have more that you' don't you
[59:57] think that he'd be more pleased with me
[59:58] saying today you can have more uh
[1:00:02] association and more relationship and
[1:00:04] you can enter into another realm and
[1:00:06] another sphere you can enter in where
[1:00:09] the things that are troubling you is
[1:00:10] when you walked in the doors today. I'm
[1:00:13] telling you that you can you can enter
[1:00:15] into such an experience WITH GOD. THE
[1:00:17] SAME thing that bothered you till you
[1:00:18] came in is gone when you go out.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Things that are weighing down on you
[1:00:29] will be released from you IN HIS
[1:00:31] PRESENCE. THE SUPERNATURAL IS HAPPENING
[1:00:34] TO SAY, "OH GOD,
[1:00:36] I BELIEVE WHAT THIS MAN'S SAYING. I
[1:00:39] BELIEVE IT'S IN YOUR WORD.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; AND I ENTER INTO THAT FREELY.
[1:00:45] I ACCEPT IT.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IT.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THIS IS FOR ME.
[1:00:53] [Music]
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep preaching till the
[1:00:56] fear leaves you.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Going to keep preaching till these
[1:01:00] troubling things leave you. Satan in the
[1:01:02] NAME OF JESUS HAS NO RIGHT TO YOUR MIND.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; IT'S A BATTLEGROUND, BUT WE HAVE WON THE
[1:01:09] VICTORY OVER HIM.
[1:01:11] YOU'RE NOT TO LAY THERE AND WALLOW IN
[1:01:13] THE DUST.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT TO LAY THERE AND REMAIN
[1:01:16] DEFEATED.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; OUR LORD,
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; THE SUPERNATURAL GOD HAS PAID THE PRICE
[1:01:23] AND HAS DEFEATED THAT ENEMY.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE TO AGREE WITH JESUS.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST AGREE WITH THE CONQUEROR.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; There's so many voices. Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "There's so many
[1:01:42] voices today that takes the voice of
[1:01:45] God, the voice of the Lord away from us.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; There's the voices of pleasure
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; and there's voices of many people are
[1:01:53] listening to that where they can go and
[1:01:55] have a good time."
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; He says, "But then to really get down
[1:02:00] and pray, they got so many other things
[1:02:02] to do. There's so many voices in the
[1:02:05] world, so many things to attract our
[1:02:08] attention from God." He said in the
[1:02:10] voice of God is these last days. One
[1:02:13] reason that the church is in the
[1:02:14] condition, think of what he said now.
[1:02:16] One reason the church is in its
[1:02:18] condition is is that it's in is because
[1:02:22] there is so many voices and so many
[1:02:24] other voices to attract the church from
[1:02:27] the voice of God. Not even talking about
[1:02:30] the unbeliever. We're talking about the
[1:02:31] church. SO THAT'S WHY I'M PREACHING THAT
[1:02:33] WE CAN CUT THOSE THINGS AWAY.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT THEY STILL MIGHT EXIST.
[1:02:38] THE VOICES ARE STILL THERE, BUT IT GOES
[1:02:40] OVER YOUR HEAD. YOU'RE NOT BEING
[1:02:41] AFFECTED BY IT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
[1:02:43] ALLOW IT TO DISTRACT YOU. YOU HAVE THE
[1:02:46] SAME JOB, THE SAME BURDENS, THE SAME
[1:02:48] BILLS, BUT THEY DON'T MEAN THE SAME
[1:02:50] THING.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, FOLKS,
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; we got to preach rapture faith.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T STAY BOGGED DOWN AND PREACH
[1:03:03] RAPTURE. I'M PREACHING SOMETHING THAT
[1:03:06] SETS US FREE FROM THIS. IN HIS PRESENCE
[1:03:09] IS THE FULLNESS OF JOY AND AT HIS RIGHT
[1:03:12] HAND ARE PLEASURES FOREVER MORE.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; There's so many voices, he said in
[1:03:24] another place
[1:03:26] in the earth today that it's absolutely
[1:03:28] a hard thing because of the because it
[1:03:31] deadens the voice of the supernatural.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:38] when God came to Moses
[1:03:43] and there's a a wonderful
[1:03:46] conversation that takes place between
[1:03:47] Moses and God.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; And uh Moses said, "Show me thy glory."
[1:03:56] And God answered and he said, "Uh, no
[1:04:01] one has seen my face. You can't see my
[1:04:04] face
[1:04:05] now." So he says, "Show me your glory."
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Says, "No man has seen my face."
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; But he says that my presence
[1:04:17] will go with thee.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; And and I will give you rest.
[1:04:23] And he said unto him, "If your presence,
[1:04:26] if thy presence go not with me, carest
[1:04:29] not up hence." In other words, if you
[1:04:31] don't go with me,
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; your face, your presence, your person,
[1:04:37] if you don't go WITH ME, DON'T CARRY US
[1:04:39] UP HENCE.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; In Deuteronomy, God spoke and said,
[1:04:45] "There arose not a prophet since in
[1:04:48] Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord
[1:04:51] knew face to face."
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN IN MY PRESENCE. HE
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; STAYED IN MY PRESENCE. I SPOKE TO HIM
[1:04:59] AND HE DID WHAT I TOLD HIM TO DO.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; And when he struck the rock twice, he
[1:05:06] was not allowed to go into the promised
[1:05:08] land. And he accepted that.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; He didn't whine and whimper
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; and pray and beg.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Said, "That's it."
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; IS WHAT GOD HAS SAID.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; And he accepted it.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And he told the people, "I can't go with
[1:05:23] you."
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Cuz he told me, "I can't go."
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. told him to go up Mount Nebo and
[1:05:29] there he he he died.
[1:05:35] And Jesus said
[1:05:38] of himself, "And he that sent me is with
[1:05:41] me."
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; The Father hath not left me alone.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; There he IS. GOD IN FLESH.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; HE THAT SENT ME IS WITH ME. AMEN.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; I preached I believe in Tucson about
[1:05:58] 1978
[1:06:00] the message the other angel.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; How many have heard it?
[1:06:05] Number of hands. A few. The other angel.
[1:06:09] I said they knew Moses. They knew Moses.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Moses. He went into the wilderness but
[1:06:15] when he came back they didn't know the
[1:06:18] one that was with him.
[1:06:20] Hallelujah.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus said, "He that's
[1:06:23] with me." They knew Jesus of Nazareth, a
[1:06:26] prophet from Nazareth, a great teacher,
[1:06:28] and all kinds of other things. And
[1:06:30] that's not enough.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY IT WASN'T ENOUGH. WHEN THE
[1:06:35] WOMAN AT THE WELL SAID, "I PERCEIVE THAT
[1:06:37] YOU'RE A PROPHET." HE DIDN'T SAY, "God
[1:06:40] bless you."
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; How wonderful it is
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; that you've recognized I'm a prophet.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; THAT WASN'T ENOUGH. YES, SIR.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; IT TOOK A THIRD PULL.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; TOOK THE TOOK TO TOOK HER TO BE ABLE TO
[1:06:53] SEE THAT HE WAS CHRIST.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU TO REALIZE THAT
[1:06:58] THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM A PROPHET. THAT'S
[1:07:01] NOT ENOUGH OR EVEN THE MESSENGER OF THE
[1:07:03] AGE OR MALACHI 4. IT'S MORE THAN MALACHI
[1:07:06] 4. IT'S REVELATION 10.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; IT'S CHRIST HIMSELF.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; IT'S A MIGHTY LION HIMSELF THAT HAS
[1:07:14] SPOKEN.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH. BUT WHEN HE
[1:07:18] SPOKE, THUNDERS UTTERED THEIR VOICES.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; And unless we get this message going
[1:07:30] beyond
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; a prophet of God or brother Brandham and
[1:07:34] so on, how wonderful all that is. It
[1:07:36] goes beyond that.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; That's why he he spent so much of his
[1:07:40] life in two worlds. What was the other
[1:07:42] world? The world was the other one of
[1:07:44] the supernatural.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, I pray that
[1:07:50] you will enter into another sphere, into
[1:07:52] another realm. I'm here to announce to
[1:07:54] you, it is yours. It's yours. And God is
[1:07:57] inviting you into it. And that's why I'm
[1:07:59] here speaking to you today. God is
[1:08:01] inviting you into it. We've got to COME
[1:08:03] TO ANOTHER PLANE, ANOTHER LEVEL, ANOTHER
[1:08:06] PLACE
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; TO ENTER INTO WHAT GOD HAS FOR US.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; I'M CONVINCED that
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; we need something more.
[1:08:17] for rapturing faith.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; They don't know the way.
[1:08:35] Sister,
[1:08:37] your baby is very sick.
[1:08:40] She probably knew that.
[1:08:43] They really don't know what's the matter
[1:08:45] with it.
[1:08:47] She didn't know that and they didn't
[1:08:50] know that
[1:08:52] because it's got trouble in its in its
[1:08:55] neck
[1:08:57] and it's a gland swelling.
[1:09:02] You was to take that baby to the doctor,
[1:09:05] the hospital.
[1:09:07] It was about yesterday.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; She knew that.
[1:09:13] But you're holding off. She also knew
[1:09:16] that. Said, "That's very good faith for
[1:09:19] a sinner."
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; She probably didn't know that.
[1:09:26] Here's a man of God calling me a sinner.
[1:09:30] That's good faith for a sinner. You used
[1:09:34] to be a Catholic, wasn't you?
[1:09:37] And you quit the Catholic church.
[1:09:40] That's right. And then you started going
[1:09:43] to a Pentecostal church, but you didn't
[1:09:46] join it. You haven't been back to that
[1:09:49] church for about a year.
[1:09:51] Who is this?
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Who is this?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; WHO IS THIS ONE THAT'S AMONGST US?
[1:10:01] [Music]
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; He knows what you tried to join.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; He knows WHAT YOU TRIED TO GET
[1:10:08] SATISFACTION FROM. HE KNOWS WHERE YOU
[1:10:10] TRIED TO GET SPIRITUAL HELP FROM. HE
[1:10:13] KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; HE EVEN SAID TO SOME, "YOU WERE YOU WERE
[1:10:17] TO ANOTHER MEETING. YOU WERE TO OR
[1:10:19] ROBERT'S MEETING. YOU WERE PRAYED FOR
[1:10:20] FOR THIS SAME THING. IN FACT, AS YOU
[1:10:22] CAME TO MY MEETING AND I PRAYED FOR YOU
[1:10:25] ALSO AND THEY WERE THERE AGAIN." WHO
[1:10:27] KNOWS THAT?
[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; And does he KNOW WHAT I'M ASKING YOU?
[1:10:33] DOES HE KNOW IT ABOUT THAT LADY OR THAT
[1:10:36] PERSON AND DOESN'T KNOW IT ABOUT YOU? HE
[1:10:38] KNOWS EVERY INFINITE PART OF YOU
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT INTERESTED JUST IN TELLING
[1:10:46] YOU SOME INFORMATION. HE WANTS YOU TO
[1:10:48] KNOW I'M HERE TO TRY TO HELP YOU.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Some of you got some
[1:10:58] habit, some weakness of the world that's
[1:11:02] hanging on to you. Listen to me, young
[1:11:05] person OR WHOEVER YOU MIGHT BE. THAT CAN
[1:11:08] END TODAY.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; THAT CAN END RIGHT NOW.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A HAND
[1:11:15] LAID ON YOU. ALL YOU NEED TO SAY IS, "I
[1:11:17] BELIEVE WHAT THAT MAN IS PREACHING. I
[1:11:20] BELIEVE THAT SUPERNATURAL ONE IS HERE. I
[1:11:23] BELIEVE HE KNOWS MY NAME, KNOWS WHERE I
[1:11:25] LIVE, AND HE'S HERE TO SET ME FREE OF
[1:11:28] IT."
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:31] HALLELUJAH. Do
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; you want to stand up and take your
[1:11:38] liberty?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to stand up and take my
[1:11:40] freedom.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take my deliverance. I'M
[1:11:44] GOING TO TAKE WHAT GOD HAS PURCHASED FOR
[1:11:46] ME.
[1:11:48] AND IN THE NAME OF JESUS, YOU CAN
[1:11:50] RECEIVE IT NOW. HE CAN HAVE IT NOW. IT'S
[1:11:54] MORE THAN EXCITEMENT. IT'S MORE THAN
[1:11:56] THAT. IT IS HIM,
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; the person.
[1:12:02] of Jesus CHRIST
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; HERE TO GIVE US SUPERNATURAL
[1:12:08] GIVE US A SUPERNATURAL AID SUPERNATURAL
[1:12:10] DELIVERANCE
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR SITUATION
[1:12:16] praise him
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:12:19] he's the worthy one
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; THE SHACKLES ARE DROPPING
[1:12:24] [Applause]
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:33] Thank you Lord.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; He who knows the way is here to show us
[1:12:46] the way.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; HE IS THE WAY.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; I AM THE WAY.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; THE WAY HAS COME BACK.
[1:12:54] GLORY TO GOD.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; THE WAY HAS COME BACK. WE DON'T NEED TO
[1:12:58] BE CONFUSED ANYMORE.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; The way has come back.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH HAS COME BACK. THE REVELATION
[1:13:06] of Jesus Christ has come to his people.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; We praise you, Lord Jesus.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:20] Would you like me to carry on a few more
[1:13:22] moments?
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; You may just have your seats then.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; You haven't been back to that church for
[1:13:32] about a year. And his next line is, "You
[1:13:35] don't know what to do.
[1:13:40] This came upon your baby."
[1:13:43] Now, she doesn't know this. This came
[1:13:46] upon your baby that you might serve the
[1:13:49] Lord.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT GRACE IS THIS?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; There she is confused. I'M A CATHOLIC. I
[1:14:03] I I LEFT THE Catholic church. I've gone
[1:14:05] now to the Pentecostal. I've been there
[1:14:07] for a year and I haven't been back for a
[1:14:10] year and now my baby's in need. Just
[1:14:12] holding HER BABY. AND HE SAYS, "THEY
[1:14:14] DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; You don't know what's WRONG WITH IT."
[1:14:19] WHY? BECAUSE ADAM LOST HIS WAY.
[1:14:22] [Music]
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THE WAY WAS
[1:14:26] LOST.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M HERE TO ANNOUNCE, AND I KNOW
[1:14:28] THAT YOU BELIEVE IT, BUT THE WAY HAS
[1:14:31] COME BACK TO THE CHURCH.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IT BE TRAGIC TO HAVE THE
[1:14:37] WAY, HE WHO IS THE WAY, COME BACK WITH
[1:14:40] THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE, THIS KIND OF
[1:14:43] REVELATION, AND US TO CARRY ON IN A
[1:14:46] STUPER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T
[1:14:48] WE'RE TOO CONNECTED TO THE WORLD.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; FORGET THE WORLD.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; HEAR ME. FORGET THE WORLD. AMEN.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you to forget your
[1:15:01] education or forget YOUR JOB, BUT TREAT
[1:15:04] IT AS THOUGH IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
[1:15:07] [Music]
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; EXACTLY.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; This came upon your baby that you might
[1:15:18] serve the Lord. Now go and be born again
[1:15:22] of his spirit and I bless the baby.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Who is this?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Is it the man? IS IT THE SUPERNATURAL
[1:15:32] ONE? YOU CAN'T SEPARATE THE MESSAGE FROM
[1:15:34] THE MESSENGER.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; You can't SAY, "I HONOR YOU, GOD, AND I
[1:15:39] HAVE NOTHING TO do with the pastor. I
[1:15:41] have nothing to do with my brother. I
[1:15:43] couldn't care less about the people I
[1:15:44] sit around." God won't honor that. YOU
[1:15:47] HAVE TO SAY, "I SEE GOD IN YOU. I SEE
[1:15:50] GOD IN YOU."
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WHEN YOU SAY, "GOD BLESS
[1:15:53] YOU, I ACCEPT THAT."
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; People tell me ALL THE TIME, "I'M
[1:15:58] PRAYING FOR YOU." AND I ANSWER THEM
[1:15:59] RIGHT AWAY. THANK YOU FOR PRAYING FOR
[1:16:01] US.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you for praying for us.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; What better thing could we have in this
[1:16:06] world than to have brothers AND SISTERS
[1:16:08] IN CHRIST PRAYING for us? Amen.
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; I think we should take these things
[1:16:17] serious.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; When somebody takes your hand say, "God
[1:16:20] bless you." You should think right away
[1:16:22] what the prophet of God said about that.
[1:16:24] That they're saying the best thing that
[1:16:26] can be said.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; That's better than saying, "Here's a
[1:16:31] million dollars."
[1:16:33] WELL, A MILLION DOLLARS COULD BE GONE
[1:16:35] AND GIVE YOU A LOT OF TROUBLE,
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BLESSING OF GOD WILL BE THERE
[1:16:39] FOREVER.
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Come and see message.
[1:16:50] How do you do?
[1:16:55] This would fit perhaps some that are
[1:16:57] here. You're in trouble.
[1:17:04] You're not sick,
[1:17:07] only you're nervous.
[1:17:10] You're upset.
[1:17:12] It's a mental distress like because
[1:17:14] you're halting between two opinions.
[1:17:18] What you must do in life.
[1:17:21] Yours is not sickness.
[1:17:24] You have a child, don't you?
[1:17:27] A boy.
[1:17:29] You're having family trouble at home.
[1:17:32] Isn't that right?
[1:17:34] And you don't know what And you don't
[1:17:36] want a divorce in your family. You don't
[1:17:40] know what to do. That incredible.
[1:17:45] You know what's incredible
[1:17:47] is that this God
[1:17:50] has enough
[1:17:52] in his great eternal being has enough
[1:17:54] concern
[1:17:57] to come down and speak to a person say
[1:17:59] you're in trouble.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; You don't know what to do.
[1:18:09] I come to this church. God, are you that
[1:18:12] close?
[1:18:15] Are you that real?
[1:18:19] Are you
[1:18:21] are you that personal?
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; You care about my problem,
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; my trouble,
[1:18:29] my pain, my sickness,
[1:18:33] my question.
[1:18:38] God wants you to admit that.
[1:18:41] and wants to turn your focus to him.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; You're not going to sort it out
[1:18:45] yourself.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; You're not going to fix it yourself.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; He's the only one.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; He's the only one that can fix it,
[1:18:54] right?
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; You might improve things.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; I was asked in my office once,
[1:19:04] "What do you believe about Christian
[1:19:06] psychologists?"
[1:19:09] I said, 'Well, they help perhaps a lot
[1:19:11] of people,
[1:19:13] but they can never help you.
[1:19:16] You have received
[1:19:19] the message from almighty God.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; And while Christian psychologists, if
[1:19:24] that's the best that they have, that's
[1:19:27] fine. I have nothing to say about that.
[1:19:30] They have a lot of them, they said, I
[1:19:32] said they take the principles of the
[1:19:34] Bible and show people how they should
[1:19:36] live. And if they apply those principles
[1:19:38] and some of them are laws of God, they
[1:19:41] will work. The Christian businessmen,
[1:19:44] although they didn't receive Brother
[1:19:46] Brandham, they opened the doors for him
[1:19:48] and kept the doors open the longest for
[1:19:50] him even after churches had closed the
[1:19:52] doors. Christian businessmen kept the
[1:19:54] doors open. But he had to preach doing
[1:19:56] God a service without his will because
[1:19:58] they thought the churches aren't getting
[1:20:00] the gospel out. because they're all
[1:20:02] divided up in their denominations. But
[1:20:04] we we enter into a forum here where we
[1:20:07] don't we we disregard the denominations
[1:20:10] and they can come Catholic,
[1:20:11] Episcopalian, Lutheran, Salvation Army,
[1:20:14] Pentecost, oral, whatever more and we're
[1:20:16] all here in one big fellowship. And and
[1:20:18] not only that, God's blessed us and
[1:20:20] given us the money to do what the church
[1:20:21] can't do. And that's why brother Brown
[1:20:23] said having having money and having
[1:20:26] success is no rule of spirituality.
[1:20:30] They thought they were spiritual because
[1:20:32] God had blessed them. No, that's just a
[1:20:34] law. You give and it'll be given to you.
[1:20:37] Doesn't mean a person gets spiritual.
[1:20:39] You give and God will give it back to
[1:20:41] you and God will increase it. That's a
[1:20:42] law of God. But but he said now they
[1:20:45] were going to take and preach the
[1:20:46] gospel. He said don't do that.
[1:20:50] God wasn't against him
[1:20:59] in the message.
[1:21:01] I'm going to close in a few minutes. I'm
[1:21:03] not near done. But I what I felt to do
[1:21:06] today, I felt that I would just bring as
[1:21:10] many
[1:21:12] different aspects of the presence of God
[1:21:16] because it'll mean something to one
[1:21:18] person while perhaps something else will
[1:21:20] mean something to another person. And I
[1:21:22] hope that I scatter the word out and it
[1:21:24] will really lodge in your heart
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; and change things for you and for your
[1:21:30] home and for your life,
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; for your future.
[1:21:37] in why Christ speak.
[1:21:42] Who was I speaking to yesterday?
[1:21:46] Yes. They read in the message. Why
[1:21:48] Christ speak?
[1:21:55] He said it was he
[1:22:00] that night when I was going down the
[1:22:03] road and seen that big mamba snake about
[1:22:05] to get my brother. He said, "You've been
[1:22:09] given the power to bind him or any other
[1:22:13] of the rest of them."
[1:22:15] It was he that said to my little
[1:22:19] gay-headed wife sitting back there, it
[1:22:22] was he that morning that woke me up
[1:22:25] there in the room and standing in the
[1:22:27] corner said, "Don't fear to do anything
[1:22:30] or go anywhere or say anything for the
[1:22:34] never failing presence of Jesus Christ
[1:22:37] will be with you wherever you go."
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a gift. He didn't he didn't
[1:22:44] say it was my gift. He said it was he
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; is the person. It was he when his wife
[1:22:50] had the tumor and he put his hand under
[1:22:52] there and it was gone. It was he.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give glory to God.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give glory to God. We don't
[1:23:07] have to just read a quote. We've got
[1:23:08] people right here
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; and I can say it was he. Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And he's the same.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; What he did yesterday or last time, last
[1:23:18] week in your life, it's still him.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And you want to be able to say and SAY
[1:23:24] IT VERBALLY, IT'S HE. IT WAS HE THAT
[1:23:27] SPOKE TO ME. IT WAS HE WHO DREW ME. IT'S
[1:23:31] BECAUSE OF HIM I'M HERE.
[1:23:33] [Music]
[1:23:40] Don't talk to my wife about it, but she
[1:23:42] had a growth
[1:23:44] in her female organs.
[1:23:48] And a doctor right here in this city
[1:23:51] said, "We need to take that out."
[1:23:57] We didn't know whether it's malignant or
[1:23:59] what it is.
[1:24:02] She went to the hospital,
[1:24:06] came out of the operating room,
[1:24:10] and the doctor said,
[1:24:12] "We couldn't find it."
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; She said, "Where did it go?" He said,
[1:24:18] "We don't know." Hallelujah.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE KIND OF GOD I BELIEVE IN.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:27] AMEN.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; On another occasion, she had serious
[1:24:30] trouble
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; and a doctor of a specialist on
[1:24:35] Vancouver Island had attended her. He
[1:24:37] said, "If this symptoms, if this ever
[1:24:39] comes back, you come back immediately
[1:24:41] cuz this is serious.
[1:24:45] It was here
[1:24:48] while we have the church."
[1:24:50] And we're going down to visit some
[1:24:52] people in Tacoma.
[1:24:57] and she walked. We're going out the
[1:24:59] door. She has her coat on. She put her
[1:25:01] hand on the door knob
[1:25:03] and didn't open it.
[1:25:06] She turned around to me. She said, "That
[1:25:08] thing has come back."
[1:25:13] I said, "When?"
[1:25:15] Said, "About 3 weeks ago."
[1:25:18] And she said, "I want you in a very
[1:25:20] determined way. I want you to take the
[1:25:23] oil
[1:25:24] and anoint me with oil and pray for me.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Now, she's not saying, "Dear lovey,
[1:25:31] would you like to do it and get some
[1:25:33] oil?" It had nothing to do with that.
[1:25:35] This wasn't deary lovey husband,
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; I want you
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; as her as her spiritual head,
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; as her pastor, I want you to get the oil
[1:25:47] because that's what happens here. That's
[1:25:49] what the word of God says. We went back
[1:25:51] to the kitchen.
[1:25:53] She pulled a chair out and she knelted a
[1:25:56] chair. I anoint her with oil in the name
[1:25:58] of the Lord Jesus Christ. And by the
[1:26:00] time her hand at the door knob again, it
[1:26:03] was gone.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S FOREVER GONE.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; WHY SHOULDN'T WE REJOICE? WE'RE NOT
[1:26:14] TALKING. IT'S MORE THAN WORDS ON A BOOK.
[1:26:17] IS MORE THAN HISTORY. IT'S A LIVING
[1:26:21] CRISIS HERE.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; HE'S CLOSER TO YOU THAN YOU DARE THINK.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; HE'S MORE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU THAN YOU
[1:26:31] EVEN DARE THINK ABOUT IT.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; I SAY GLORY to God.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Does he use doctors? Yes, he does.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; We have perfect peace about that.
[1:26:47] He may and he may not. He may choose a
[1:26:50] different He MAY CHOOSE SOMETHING HIGH.
[1:26:52] HE MAY CHOOSE THE SUPERNATURAL. HE'S A
[1:26:54] SUPERNATURAL GOD.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; He lets this come upon this baby
[1:27:03] because her spiritual life needs it.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God allows things
[1:27:10] to come our way.
[1:27:12] You've had trouble
[1:27:16] and your trouble drove you to your
[1:27:18] knees.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; You've had trouble and your trouble
[1:27:22] drove you to seek God.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to the sisters
[1:27:31] and those that are in a in a nursery,
[1:27:36] hear what I'm saying. Don't be visiting
[1:27:39] now.
[1:27:41] You honor your husband.
[1:27:44] You re re regard what the word of God
[1:27:47] has said that God has given him wisdom
[1:27:50] and God has given him leadership in your
[1:27:52] home and in your life. And honor him.
[1:27:55] And I will say this, follow him as he
[1:27:58] follows Christ.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; He must follow Christ. Follow me, Paul
[1:28:03] says, as he follows Christ.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; And that's important. I know it gets
[1:28:07] quiet in here. I'm going to say it
[1:28:08] anyway. Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; This age is opposed to that.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Separate yourself from this world.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; And I'll say two things. The spirit of
[1:28:19] this age is here to make the men more
[1:28:22] weak spiritually. Rise above that thing.
[1:28:26] Cast that off and say, "I will assume my
[1:28:29] responsibility and I will be the
[1:28:31] spiritual example and the spiritual head
[1:28:34] of this home." Amen. Amen.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And then for the wife to honor that and
[1:28:39] support that and do everything that she
[1:28:42] can to encourage that and to let her
[1:28:45] know I'm with you.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; I'll just take maybe five minutes.
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; It was he up in Sabina Canyon.
[1:29:06] about 3 months ago when I was praying,
[1:29:09] wondering what was going to happen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; He was wondering what was going to
[1:29:15] happen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; And I was standing there and a sword
[1:29:19] dropped INTO MY HAND. OH, THANK GOD. THE
[1:29:22] SWORD DROPPED INTO HIS HAND. NOT A
[1:29:24] SWORD, THE KING'S SWORD.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S A SWORD OF POWER. IT'S
[1:29:31] A SWORD TO DESTROY THE ENEMY. USE THIS
[1:29:34] WORD TO DESTROY THE ENEMY.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; For he hath said
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; in Hebrews 13, I will never leave thee
[1:29:46] nor forsake thee. Do you believe that?
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT?
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT FROM HERE QUOTING
[1:29:52] THAT. I, THE SUPERNATURAL ONE WHO
[1:29:55] BROUGHT THIS MESSAGE, WILL NEVER LEAVE
[1:29:57] YOU. I WILL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. AND I'LL
[1:30:01] NEVER CEASE BEING SUPERNATURAL.
[1:30:03] I'LL NEVER CEASE BEING ALL POWERFUL.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I'm sure one day we may, I hope we don't
[1:30:12] have to regret letting the things of
[1:30:14] this life, you know, we can have
[1:30:16] burdens, we can have difficulties, we
[1:30:18] can have things that we wonder about,
[1:30:20] BUT DON'T LET IT press us down
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; below our spiritual privileges.
[1:30:26] Amen.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT PREACHING BECAUSE IT'S POPULAR.
[1:30:29] WHEN I SPEAK about the home and I SPEAK
[1:30:31] ABOUT HUSBANDS AND I SPEAK ABOUT WIVES,
[1:30:33] IT'S BECAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH. AND I KNOW
[1:30:36] THAT THE SPIRIT OF THIS AGE IS AGAINST
[1:30:38] IT. VERY MUCH AGAINST IT. AND I'M
[1:30:40] AGAINST IT ALSO.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Don't forget this age is a perverted
[1:30:52] age.
[1:30:56] in the curtain of time as as true as I'm
[1:30:59] standing on this platform. He said that
[1:31:02] the resurrected Jesus Christ is right in
[1:31:04] this building talking to individuals
[1:31:06] right now.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; If you could only recognize that it's
[1:31:10] his voice. I'm not talking about
[1:31:12] something back in 1955. I'm talking
[1:31:15] about something that is present in 2011
[1:31:19] because that God cannot leave that word.
[1:31:22] He's as in much attendance to that word
[1:31:25] as HE WAS BACK THEN. HE CAN'T NEVER
[1:31:28] LEAVE. HE NEVER LEFT MOSES, NEVER LEFT
[1:31:31] JESUS, NEVER LEFT THE PROPHETS, NEVER
[1:31:33] LEFT THE MESSENGERS, AND HE WILL NOT
[1:31:35] LEAVE THIS MESSAGE.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU GOT THAT MESSAGE, AND
[1:31:39] YOU'RE ABSORBING IT,
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD OF GOD IS OPENING TO YOU.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, FRIENDS. THERE IS NOTHING
[1:31:46] IN THIS WORLD THAT CAN TAKE YOU.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. AMEN.
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; In Jehovah Gyra,
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; praise God,
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; he's talking to someone. Now, this is
[1:32:01] not this might sound disconnected, but
[1:32:04] it's not. In Jehovah Gyra, he said a
[1:32:06] tumor in the head, but God can heal you.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; That's a serious thing and serious
[1:32:12] operation, which I would be doubtful of.
[1:32:16] And I'm not saying that to discourage
[1:32:18] you, but I want you to have faith in our
[1:32:21] Lord Jesus who's here now, who knows
[1:32:24] you. And you know you're standing. You
[1:32:27] know you're standing in the his
[1:32:29] presence. The presence of your brother
[1:32:32] wouldn't let you feel like you that I'm
[1:32:34] just a man. But you know that he's
[1:32:37] close.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring it even know so
[1:32:40] they can get it separated. You're in
[1:32:42] front of a man, but that feeling THAT
[1:32:44] YOU HAVE DIDN'T come from this man.
[1:32:47] THAT'S HIM AND THIS IS ME.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. DON'T YOU LIKE
[1:32:53] THIS KIND OF WITH THIS kind of truth?
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; You need him.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; You'll need him. You need him right now.
[1:33:01] You'll need him tomorrow. You'll need
[1:33:02] him.
[1:33:16] You know you're standing in his
[1:33:18] presence. The presence of your brother
[1:33:20] wouldn't let you feel like that. I'm
[1:33:23] just a man.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; But you know he's close.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; In the Queen of the South, he said,
[1:33:28] "When the supernatural is displayed,
[1:33:31] it's in the presence of God." Yeah.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; When the supernatural is displayed,
[1:33:35] don't ever forget when you when you come
[1:33:38] for prayer or when you're asking for
[1:33:40] prayer, your wife or husband or whoever
[1:33:42] or the family prays and the parents pray
[1:33:45] for the children, the supernatural is
[1:33:48] there.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Don't pray just as a matter of uh uh you
[1:33:52] know, as a matter of habit. Pray in
[1:33:54] expectation.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; God's going to get a hold of this
[1:33:58] situation because we're agreeing as
[1:34:01] mother and dad. We're agreeing as
[1:34:03] husband. I'm agreeing as my wife. I'm
[1:34:05] agreeing. Hallelujah.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING AT YOU. IT'S GREATER THAN
[1:34:11] ANYTHING. I KNOW YOU FACE THINGS, BUT
[1:34:13] THE GOD I'M SPEAKING ABOUT IS PRESENT,
[1:34:16] AND HE'S GREATER THAN THE SITUATION.
[1:34:18] HE'S A GOD OF THE SUPERNATURAL.
[1:34:34] in the presence of God unrecognized this
[1:34:37] message which I've had and asked you to
[1:34:39] read. He says, "So many,
[1:34:45] listen close, so many get the same
[1:34:47] opportunity today to stand in his
[1:34:51] presence as they did then." And still
[1:34:56] because of popular opinion or whatever,
[1:35:00] they turn it down standing in the
[1:35:02] presence of God. I wonder friend tonight
[1:35:06] if we people who are Christians in his
[1:35:09] presence and are sick if we don't turn
[1:35:13] down the opportunity to be healed by
[1:35:16] just believing him.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; We who claim to believe him don't
[1:35:20] recognize really his presence
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; when he promised to do what he promised
[1:35:26] to do today.
[1:35:29] And he said in uh in uh uh believest
[1:35:32] thou this and I'm thinking about now
[1:35:35] notice the approach. I just want to just
[1:35:37] cover for a few minutes the approach
[1:35:39] because I I was saying this to the Lord
[1:35:41] myself. It's it's fine to hear all these
[1:35:43] things but what is my approach?
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Think of Esther. Do you remember Esther?
[1:35:52] She needed to approach and she knew it
[1:35:54] could be death
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; if the scepter wasn't held out extended
[1:35:58] to her. But she knew she had to do it
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; regardless with life or death.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; And he said and believest thou this. He
[1:36:07] said it's your approach to a divine
[1:36:09] gift.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Now the gift was a divine gift. Said
[1:36:12] it's your approach to the divine gift
[1:36:14] what brings the results. It's the way
[1:36:17] you come to it. And and he said the way
[1:36:19] you approach anything and he in door to
[1:36:23] the heart he said now father thou seeest
[1:36:26] this now let thy spirit come now and
[1:36:28] manifest the message and declare it to
[1:36:31] be the truth grant it father and then he
[1:36:34] says it'll have a supernatural power to
[1:36:37] do it but then it'll be according to
[1:36:39] what you think it is. He said if you if
[1:36:42] you say it's an evil spirit then you'll
[1:36:45] get an evil spirit. you'll get an evil
[1:36:49] spirit's reward. If you think it's the
[1:36:51] spirit of God, then you will get God's
[1:36:54] reward.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY, NO ONE CAN AFFORD AN EVIL
[1:37:00] SPIRIT'S REWARD. DON'T DOUBT GOD'S WORD
[1:37:04] THAT CAME WITH SUCH VINDICATION.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; SEARCH IT OUT, FRIENDS. IT'S NEVER
[1:37:09] HAPPENED. AND THEN WHEN YOU SAY IT'S
[1:37:11] NEVER HAPPENED, THEN SAY, WHO AM I THAT
[1:37:14] GOD SHOULD ASSOCIATE ME WITH THIS? WHO
[1:37:16] AM I THAT GOD SHOULD CALL ME? WHO AM I
[1:37:19] THAT HE SHOULD CONNECT ME? MAYBE through
[1:37:21] birth or maybe through a witness from
[1:37:24] someone else.
[1:37:26] I was speaking to a brother
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; from this assembly
[1:37:33] and I was relating how I ran into
[1:37:35] someone who who turned aside from this
[1:37:38] message perhaps 25 or 30 years ago and
[1:37:41] wrote articles against it and was
[1:37:43] proving that the cloud wasn't in
[1:37:45] existence. And he came into my office
[1:37:47] one day and he said that I want you to
[1:37:49] know I've turned away. I don't believe
[1:37:51] in this. I don't believe in this cloud.
[1:37:53] In fact, as I've I've proven through
[1:37:55] research, da da da da da da, that the
[1:37:57] cloud was nothing more than a missile
[1:38:00] that was uh that was destroyed over sent
[1:38:03] out from Edward's uh uh is that Edwards
[1:38:06] Fort Edwards base in in California or
[1:38:09] something
[1:38:11] and the prevailing winds and they had
[1:38:13] all the winds and had all the techn I
[1:38:15] said I said, "Well, I that's not my
[1:38:19] main. I don't just stand up and preach a
[1:38:20] cloud.
[1:38:22] I said, Elisha or Elijah, Elisha, it was
[1:38:26] his servant. He sent a servant out to go
[1:38:28] go. He said, "What do you see?" He said,
[1:38:30] "I see a cloud rising from
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; the earth." I said, "Did it come from
[1:38:37] the mist?
[1:38:39] Did it just come what c what caused the
[1:38:41] cl the cloud to rise out of the earth?
[1:38:46] What made the mist? What made the cloud?
[1:38:50] I don't know. Elijah didn't say. Elisha
[1:38:53] didn't say,
[1:38:57] what was important was the shape.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; What shape is it? It's the shape of a
[1:39:02] man's hand.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; What shape was this one? It was the
[1:39:05] shape of the FACE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE. THE SUPERNATURAL HAD TO
[1:39:11] HAPPEN. I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED. ALL
[1:39:12] I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT GOD WHO CONTROLS
[1:39:15] THE WINDS AND THE SPACE AND EVERYTHING
[1:39:17] GAVE SHAPE TO THAT VERY HEAD OF JESUS
[1:39:20] CHRIST AS THE WIG JUDGE
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; looking down on the earth.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And I sat in the meeting and brother
[1:39:28] Brandham held that up.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "How many have seen this?"
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Pretty well all had seen it. He said,
[1:39:34] "They got it the wrong way in the
[1:39:36] magazine." and he turned it and I saw
[1:39:40] you could hear a gasp come over the
[1:39:43] whole audience.
[1:39:45] We saw Jesus Christ.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; I held it out to a girl that when we got
[1:39:50] back to our home, I said, "Who's this?"
[1:39:52] She said, "Jesus."
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Theologians maybe can't see it,
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; but simple people can see it.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; It was the shape of it.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Says, "Oh, well, Brother Brenham wasn't
[1:40:04] there and he was there and people, hey,
[1:40:07] don't get wrapped up in all that
[1:40:09] nonsense."
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; And people come up with articles like
[1:40:12] that. I don't even pay any attention to
[1:40:14] it. What Why should we have unindicated,
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; UNPROVEN
[1:40:20] VOICES AND MEN RISING UP TO, YOU KNOW,
[1:40:23] CORRECT THINGS THAT BROTHER Brandham
[1:40:25] said and and because it's not, you know,
[1:40:27] just technically in line, etc., etc. I
[1:40:30] just say nonsense. I hope you support me
[1:40:33] in that.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I just say nonsense
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; because WHY WOULD I TAKE HERE'S HERE'S
[1:40:39] SOMEONE THAT GOD VINDICATED.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; GOD PROVED
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; FROM THE BEGINNING OF HIS MINISTRY TO
[1:40:45] THE END OF THE MINISTRY. WHO AM I WITH a
[1:40:48] little puny brain or SOME OTHER PERSON?
[1:40:50] NO PROOF, NO VINDICATION, NO NOTHING.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:57] I may be a simple person, but that's
[1:40:59] never bothered me.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; What people say as a go ahead, have it.
[1:41:04] Get a belly full of it. DO WHATEVER YOU
[1:41:06] WANT.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean anything to me. The only
[1:41:09] thing that means SOMETHING TO ME IS THUS
[1:41:10] SAYITH THE LORD.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND YOUR NAME IS SUCH AND
[1:41:13] SUCH. THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. GO BACK
[1:41:16] HOME. YOU'RE WELL.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; One of them laying here says that's a
[1:41:20] difficult one. That's a difficult one.
[1:41:22] It's epilepsy. That dark cloud. IT'S
[1:41:25] EPILEPSY. AND SPEAK TO HER AND GO HOME
[1:41:28] NOW AND BE FREE FROM IT. HOW CAN YOU GET
[1:41:30] FREE OF EPILEPSY THAT FAST?
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:45] The spirits come now, excuse me, another
[1:41:49] few minutes to manifest the message and
[1:41:52] declare it to be the truth.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; He said it'll have to be supernatural
[1:41:56] power to do it.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; And then it'll be according to what you
[1:42:00] think it is.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; If you think it's an evil spirit, then
[1:42:03] you'll get an evil spirit's reward.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; WHAT POWERFUL THINGS? WHOEVER, WHATEVER
[1:42:08] PREACHER EVER SAID anything like that
[1:42:11] OUT OF THE SAME RESOURCE. IF YOU THINK
[1:42:14] SO. That's why it was important. What
[1:42:15] you think?
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S IN YOUR THOUGHTS RIGHT NOW?
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHO DO YOU THINK THIS
[1:42:23] IS?
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; I'M SPEAKING IT. BUT IF IT'S NOT IF IT'S
[1:42:26] NOT THE TRUTH, GOD WON'T VINDICATE IT.
[1:42:28] BUT IF IT'S THE TRUTH, GOD WILL
[1:42:29] VINDICATE IT.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS? SAY, I
[1:42:33] BELIEVE IT'S GOD. I BELIEVE THIS IS THE
[1:42:36] HOLY SPIRIT. AND I SAY TO YOU, GOD BLESS
[1:42:38] YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. GOD BLESS HIM. GOD
[1:42:42] BLESS YOU.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; GO AND RECEIVE SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE
[1:42:46] NEVER HAD BEFORE.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; It's ours.
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:43:00] Perhaps
[1:43:04] if God allows me another time,
[1:43:09] I began to ask a question to myself, and
[1:43:11] I'll leave this with you.
[1:43:14] How did
[1:43:17] how did Abraham, our father in the
[1:43:18] faith,
[1:43:22] how did how did he ever attain
[1:43:26] friendship with God?
[1:43:29] till God would say, "You're my friend."
[1:43:35] That's
[1:43:38] supreme, sublime.
[1:43:40] You're my friend.
[1:43:43] But if you read about Abraham, if you
[1:43:45] read about him, you know, one of the
[1:43:47] outstanding things God said to Abraham,
[1:43:51] "Leave your home, leave your kindred,
[1:43:54] leave this, and go to a place I'm going
[1:43:55] to show you." And the Bible says, "And
[1:43:58] he rose up and left."
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; That was one of the things.
[1:44:03] And then you go over to the 22nd chapter
[1:44:07] of Genesis.
[1:44:11] And the Bible says, "And God tried
[1:44:14] Abraham."
[1:44:16] You know, we all, and I'm looking at
[1:44:18] you, we all have had things of trials at
[1:44:24] at different levels. And some of them
[1:44:26] have just
[1:44:28] trials that would grind a person. And
[1:44:31] that's exactly what the word is. It's
[1:44:34] it's it's the same as you've heard me
[1:44:35] say it here before. It's the same as an
[1:44:37] assay test in a mine where they drill a
[1:44:40] mine and come up with a core and then
[1:44:42] they grind the core. There's rock and
[1:44:46] stuff. They grind it to powder
[1:44:49] to actually fine powder and then they
[1:44:52] sift that through and they add chemicals
[1:44:54] to it. And that's called the assay test.
[1:44:56] That's exactly the word in in in Genesis
[1:45:01] 22:1. And God tempted or he tried
[1:45:04] Abraham. Now he's going to grind him
[1:45:08] finer than he's ever been ground before.
[1:45:11] And that's what he said. Take your son
[1:45:16] Your only son.
[1:45:19] Are you Joseph?
[1:45:21] Which one are you?
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:45:27] Take your son
[1:45:30] and assume you don't have a brother. You
[1:45:33] do have. So your only son. There were
[1:45:36] other children, but this was one by
[1:45:37] promise.
[1:45:40] And take him up to a place that I will
[1:45:42] show you.
[1:45:44] and there offer him as a burnt offering.
[1:45:52] You know what the Bible says?
[1:45:55] And he rose up early in the morning.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't go into a dialogue and say,
[1:46:02] "Well, wasn't this a a son of promise?
[1:46:04] Wasn't this a child that came? Didn't
[1:46:06] you promise this son to me?" THERE WAS
[1:46:08] NO DIALOGUE. THERE'S NO DISCUSSION.
[1:46:10] THERE'S NO NOTHING. HE GETS UP EARLY IN
[1:46:12] THE MORNING.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; HE'S SO QUICK TO OBEY.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; What am I talking about? Approach.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; AND THEN SOMETIMES GOD TALKS TO US AND
[1:46:24] HE SAYS IT AGAIN, says it again, says it
[1:46:27] again, begging us like, you know, won't
[1:46:29] you do it? Won't you do it? No. If you
[1:46:31] want to be like Abraham and enter into
[1:46:33] that kind of relationship, he rose up
[1:46:35] early in the morning
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; and uh and he cut the kindling.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Yeah.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; He prepared THE KINDLING. HE SPLIT the
[1:46:43] wooden
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; and he GOT THE DONKEYS, THE ASSES
[1:46:48] RATHER, got them and two young men and
[1:46:52] he set off
[1:46:54] three days journey.
[1:46:58] I don't know what went through his mind,
[1:47:04] but it wasn't much conversation.
[1:47:10] three days
[1:47:14] going to offer my son and he's packing
[1:47:17] the wood
[1:47:22] saying Jesus didn't say anything why
[1:47:25] have I got this cross why am I packing
[1:47:27] this wood
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; and on the third day
[1:47:36] Isaac says Father,
[1:47:40] he asked, "My son,
[1:47:43] behold the fire
[1:47:46] and the wood.
[1:47:49] Where's the lamb
[1:47:51] for a burnt offering?
[1:47:54] He'd seen it. He He knew it was
[1:47:56] happening. He knew all the time. Not
[1:47:58] that he was being offered, but he knew
[1:48:00] all the time that that's what was to
[1:48:03] happen. They got the wood. They got the
[1:48:05] fire. Where's the lamb?
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; I preached on it years ago
[1:48:12] and I don't want you to forget it.
[1:48:16] Yeah, we've got the seats.
[1:48:19] We've got the people. We're all on our
[1:48:21] journey.
[1:48:22] We've got the preacher, the ministers,
[1:48:26] deacons,
[1:48:29] songs, musicians,
[1:48:32] instruments.
[1:48:34] I hope we never have to say,
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; "But where's the lamb?"
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Where is this one
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; who's amongst us? May he always be
[1:48:45] welcome here. May he be loved here. May
[1:48:49] be he endeared to us here.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; And after three days, where's the lamb?
[1:48:56] And Abraham said, "My son,
[1:48:59] God will provide himself a lamb."
[1:49:02] That's why he was a friend. Though you
[1:49:05] take everything from me, though you
[1:49:08] grind me down,
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; as Job said, yet in my flesh shall I see
[1:49:13] God, though your health goes, though
[1:49:15] your family goes, though your job goes,
[1:49:18] though everything your success goes,
[1:49:20] though your friends go and they call you
[1:49:22] nasty things and you sit there on your
[1:49:24] ash heap, just know one thing that your
[1:49:28] connection with the supernatural is in
[1:49:30] good condition.
[1:49:34] Hallelujah.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; And God did provide a lamb.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; That's the same God.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; And he became a friend of God.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; You are children of this presence.
[1:49:59] I'm not just saying nice things.
[1:50:02] I say to you, each one of you, and if I
[1:50:05] could shake your hand today, I would
[1:50:06] say, God, for some reason, known only to
[1:50:11] himself,
[1:50:13] intercepted you.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Every person would be a completely
[1:50:18] different testimony. God intercepted
[1:50:20] you.
[1:50:23] I look across this congregation. I know
[1:50:25] the testimony of many of you, and God
[1:50:27] intercepted you.
[1:50:29] Yes.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; And called you
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; and associated you and connected you
[1:50:37] with the most supernatural message that
[1:50:40] has struck the earth since its creation.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; And he did that for a purpose.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; And friends, that's why we're here. I
[1:50:49] will never never apologize for it. We're
[1:50:51] here to extend and give this voice
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; a mighty effect in the earth.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I would like to sing if I
[1:51:00] could have the musicians please and you
[1:51:03] could stand with me.
[1:51:06] Let's just stand reverently a moment.
[1:51:11] Tonight, brother John Andy's will be
[1:51:13] speaking and preaching. We want to come
[1:51:15] early. Brother Tom will be
[1:51:19] down in Seattle with the saints down
[1:51:22] there.
[1:51:24] We're thankful to be a part of this
[1:51:28] blessed work.
[1:51:30] Father,
[1:51:31] I'm so thankful for your messenger. I'm
[1:51:34] so thankful
[1:51:35] for the one that you sent.
[1:51:38] I am even more thankful that you were in
[1:51:41] accompanyment with him all the time. So
[1:51:44] thankful for the word, oh God, that you
[1:51:47] sent through him,
[1:51:49] Lord. So thankful for these words that
[1:51:52] we could even read of of of
[1:51:56] messages which he spoke and of events
[1:51:59] which he
[1:52:01] uh told of and we learn we see secret
[1:52:05] treasures that are there for us. Father,
[1:52:08] I ask today for these my beloved beloved
[1:52:13] friends and brothers and sisters in
[1:52:15] Christ. Would you please Father,
[1:52:20] shine upon them,
[1:52:22] shine upon them with your presence. Oh
[1:52:25] divine one, lovely Lord Jesus,
[1:52:29] when the people depart these doors, may
[1:52:33] every one of them be enveloped in a
[1:52:35] special place. I would love to hear oh
[1:52:38] God testimony that this has been their
[1:52:42] experience. Do Lord as I am experiencing
[1:52:45] myself feeling a drawing and opening up
[1:52:49] and and just saying to you, oh God, here
[1:52:53] I am. I'm I'm in this message. I'm in
[1:52:56] this message to hear from the divine
[1:52:58] one. I'm in this message to obtain uh
[1:53:01] from the supernatural one. God, go to
[1:53:04] the homes and go with the people in the
[1:53:07] cars in this afternoon. Lord, may there
[1:53:09] be a strange and wonderful presence
[1:53:11] there. We thank you. We thank you. We
[1:53:14] love you. We pray that you'll receive
[1:53:16] our thanksgiving.
[1:53:18] Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, be
[1:53:22] in attendance with us, Father.
[1:53:26] Thank you, Lord. in the presence of
[1:53:27] Jehovah. Brother Ryan, please if you'd
[1:53:31] help me out there, give him microphone
[1:53:33] as well, please.
[1:53:36] In the presence

[1:53:42] of Jehovah,
[1:53:48] God Almighty.
[1:53:51] [Music]

[1:54:00] Trles
[1:54:02] manage
[1:54:07] hearts are landed
[1:54:13] in the presence
[1:54:19] of the king. Would everyone just open
[1:54:23] their heart now as we sing it again? The
[1:54:27] praise.
[1:54:29] Oh, just make love to our Lord Jesus.
[1:54:35] Oh
[1:54:37] God Almighty,
[1:54:43] gra.
[1:54:53] Oh yes, they do.
[1:55:00] Oh God. Oh God.
[1:55:03] The presence
[1:55:08] of the king
[1:55:14] in the presence
[1:55:18] [Music]
[1:55:20] of Jehovah
[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:27] God Almighty. Mighty
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:33] Prince of Peace.
[1:55:38] [Music]
[1:55:40] Trles,
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; troubles vanish,
[1:55:47] hearts
[1:55:48] are mened.
[1:55:51] Oh, thank you Lord
[1:55:53] in the presence
[1:56:00] of the king.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; This is one of those services I don't
[1:56:05] know exactly how to end.
[1:56:11] I want to pray for you.
[1:56:16] Do you have a trouble? Do you have
[1:56:18] something that's
[1:56:20] weighing you down
[1:56:24] and you've heard things now and your
[1:56:26] faith has risen
[1:56:29] and you'd like to depart these doors and
[1:56:31] know that it's settled and you've left
[1:56:34] it here at the foot of the cross.
[1:56:38] If you'd like to just raise your hand
[1:56:41] and open your heart to him
[1:56:46] and I will pray considering it a
[1:56:48] privilege.
[1:56:50] Father,
[1:56:53] these people are so precious
[1:56:56] to me, to my wife, my family.
[1:57:01] I thank you for every one of them.
[1:57:05] I was thinking of the New Year's Eve and
[1:57:09] how the different ones sang and the song
[1:57:12] that was sung by the Philippine group.
[1:57:15] Lord, I ask your blessings upon them.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Ask your blessings upon each one, oh
[1:57:21] God.
[1:57:23] Ask your blessings, Father, upon those
[1:57:25] that will gather in Seattle today.
[1:57:30] that you'll give safe journey to your
[1:57:32] servant as he travels.
[1:57:35] Father, I pray, oh God, for the bride of
[1:57:37] Jesus Christ.
[1:57:39] Pray for all of these precious ones that
[1:57:42] are here that you've called.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; And there's some, Lord, that may wonder
[1:57:46] why they're in this service this
[1:57:48] morning. There may be young people and
[1:57:50] they haven't really felt your nearness.
[1:57:53] I ask oh God just give them even a small
[1:57:57] taste if you would of your nearness and
[1:58:00] your presence oh God that they might
[1:58:03] know that they might taste what it is
[1:58:05] that they might know what it is Lord
[1:58:08] perhaps some that you would come in such
[1:58:09] a way that they'd be trembling as
[1:58:11] they're standing saying I've never felt
[1:58:14] this way before I've never heard these
[1:58:16] things before but I I long for you Lord
[1:58:19] I have a hunger in my heart I'm longing
[1:58:22] for for you, oh God. I'm longing for
[1:58:25] you. I've walked many years with you,
[1:58:28] but I'm longing for more of you,
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Lord. We've tasted our thought this
[1:58:33] morning. Never thought of it this way,
[1:58:35] but riding with your prophet in the car
[1:58:38] and and how you came the pillar of fire
[1:58:41] coming standing right before us, Lord.
[1:58:44] The same one was in the burning bush on
[1:58:47] the mountain, oh God. and calling a
[1:58:50] prophet to lead his people and to
[1:58:53] separate them out of bondage. You're the
[1:58:55] same God here tonight. Lord, I defy any
[1:58:59] bondage, any demon, any lying spirit to
[1:59:02] try to keep your people in the in a in a
[1:59:05] confused state or in dark or or try to
[1:59:08] pre prevent them, Lord, to come and
[1:59:10] surrender themselves to you. I pray,
[1:59:13] Lord, that you will just woo them. Woo
[1:59:16] them so tenderly. Father, we thank you.
[1:59:19] Some may be in need of healing,
[1:59:22] emotional healing, whatever it might be.
[1:59:25] Let them know that you're their friend.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. You're their friend,
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; and you're one that'll never leave them,
[1:59:34] never forsake them.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Dismiss us now, I pray, with your grace,
[1:59:42] [Music]
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; and return us this evening, Lord, that
[1:59:46] we might hear Yes.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; I'm anxious to hear, oh God, what you've
[1:59:50] laid in view of this service today. In
[1:59:53] view of what you're doing, I'm anxious
[1:59:55] to hear what you've laid on brother John
[1:59:57] Andy's heart. Bless the people now,
[2:00:00] Father.
[2:00:02] And when they shake hands with one
[2:00:04] another, I pray that your blessings will
[2:00:07] pass from one to another.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:14] God bless you as you turn around and
[2:00:16] shake hands with those
[2:00:19] that you want to bless in Jesus Christ's
[2:00:23] name.
[2:00:25] Hallelujah. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:00:27] name.
