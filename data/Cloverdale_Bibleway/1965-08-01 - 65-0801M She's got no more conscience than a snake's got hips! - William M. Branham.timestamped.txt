[0:00] there's only two classes of people spoke

[0:05] God and the children of the devil did
[0:08] you know that you want to put a
[0:10] scripture down for it 1 John 3:10 you
[0:12] know the scripture I'm reading it right
[0:13] here got it wrote out all right all
[0:16] right in Ephesians 2:2 they are called
[0:19] the children of
[0:21] Disobedience like Eve was disobedient to
[0:24] God's word the children of obedience and
[0:28] Disobedience have have nothing in common
[0:32] then how can the bride of Christ
[0:34] associate in a
[0:36] [Music]
[0:37] denomination when one's disobedient the
[0:39] other obedient how can one be the word
[0:42] the other perverted word how can a
[0:44] prostitute and a clean woman walk
[0:46] together in
[0:48] agreement you can't do it they have no
[0:51] fellowship at all come out from amongst
[0:53] us it's all the devil it's a mark of the
[0:56] beast heading right into it now all
[0:59] denominations I care whose it is God's
[1:01] taken not a denomination of people for
[1:04] his name a denomination won't receive
[1:06] these truths it'll take an individual
[1:08] person that can see God and look at his
[1:09] word and believe it belong no
[1:11] organization but live for God not for
[1:13] his organization the intellectual wisdom
[1:15] of some bishop or something is called it
[1:17] that's right the children of
[1:19] Disobedience and the children of
[1:21] obedience has nothing in common one of
[1:24] the is of the day of light the other of
[1:28] night and darkness
[1:30] evil age this evil age of Darkness
[1:33] nightclubs dances yet belong to church
[1:36] it's okay with their God they don't have
[1:38] any condemnation about it nothing
[1:39] bothers them well don't condemn me to
[1:41] cut my hair woman
[1:43] said don't hurt my
[1:46] conscience she's got no more conscience
[1:48] than a snake's got hips certainly not
[1:51] you don't know what her conscience is
[1:53] has been sured the hard till she don't
[1:55] even know what it is that's right
