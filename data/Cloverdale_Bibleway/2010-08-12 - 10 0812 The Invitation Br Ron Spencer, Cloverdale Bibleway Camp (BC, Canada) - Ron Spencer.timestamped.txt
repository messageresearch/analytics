[7:07] Amen. We're going to turn the service
[7:08] over to brother Biscll to a few opening
[7:10] comments maybe just as he does. Why
[7:11] don't we sing, "Welcome Holy Spirit. We
[7:13] are in your presence." Amen. We're
[7:16] thankful.
[7:17] Oh, welcome Holy Spirit.
[7:23] Yes, Lord. We are in your presence.

[9:29] Just take a
[9:33] welcome.
[9:35] Welcome Holy Spirit.
[9:40] Lord we are in your presence.
[9:46] Oh, fill us with your power.
[9:52] Live inside of me.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; Well, that's our desire tonight.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; I just want to make a few comments
[10:09] before we pray. And uh I'm going to be
[10:12] asking brother Tim Dodd to come and lead
[10:15] us in prayer and ask uh God's not merely
[10:19] his blessing. We want his perfect will.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Dodd in in this meeting. There's
[10:26] been a lot of prayer that's gone up.
[10:28] We've been praying. They've been praying
[10:29] in the prayer meetings and people have
[10:31] been praying individually at home. We've
[10:34] been praying that there be a holy holy
[10:37] blanket
[10:38] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit, a holy cloud upon
[10:42] this entire gathering. And all that
[10:45] happens here is for his praise
[10:48] &gt;&gt; and his glory.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to have you take your
[10:51] seats for a few moments.
[11:08] There's three things that we're here
[11:11] for.
[11:13] And one is
[11:15] I and I would like each of you to be
[11:17] able to say this within yourself
[11:21] that you could in agreement say I'm here
[11:25] for this purpose.
[11:27] Uh this is my prayer and these are words
[11:30] that I spoke to the Lord before the
[11:32] service tonight and I I feel that they
[11:36] are they are words that we could all
[11:39] agree with and make it our prayer. We
[11:42] are here tonight to hear words of God.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; We are here tonight to give ourselves
[11:50] unreservedly
[11:52] &gt;&gt; to his purpose and his will.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; And we are here tonight
[11:58] Not just this evening, but we're here to
[12:00] encourage one another and to edify
[12:03] someone else. We want to be spiritually
[12:06] productive.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; And we don't know what that might be,
[12:10] just a word. It may be just your
[12:11] presence, the fact that you are here.
[12:15] The fact that you're not somewhere else,
[12:16] but you're here will be an encouragement
[12:19] to someone else.
[12:22] I've been speaking to brother Ron
[12:23] Spencer just about his how he feels
[12:27] about the service. He said they came
[12:29] from Edmonton. He said they had one of
[12:31] the most special times
[12:35] uh in in services in Edmonton
[12:38] and uh I just felt it was no doubt in
[12:41] preparation for us here. We've come with
[12:45] great expectation
[12:47] &gt;&gt; and as you said tonight, brother Roy,
[12:49] and it really touched my heart. You
[12:51] don't know if you've ever felt a greater
[12:53] expectation
[12:54] &gt;&gt; and I think that all of us can ask,
[12:56] "Father, give us such an expectation so
[13:00] that we are pulling on the ministry of
[13:01] the word."
[13:03] &gt;&gt; There's two things that are happening at
[13:06] the same time in a meeting like this.
[13:08] And I just want to bring it to your
[13:11] attention before we go on in the service
[13:14] because I wanted to welcome everyone
[13:17] that has come
[13:19] and some have come from some long
[13:21] distances but we're so happy that you're
[13:23] here.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; And uh we have felt to really turn these
[13:28] meeting not into so much a youth camp.
[13:30] This is a family camp.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; Mothers and fathers are here. Families
[13:34] are here. and I've heard already from
[13:37] several. It is so wonderful just to be
[13:40] able to mingle with uh the people that
[13:43] are able to be here as families uh and
[13:46] some that were here during during the
[13:49] junior camp. They have just uh stayed on
[13:53] for the for this next four days and I
[13:56] think it's just wonderful. But the two
[13:59] things that are happening at the same
[14:01] time,
[14:04] brother Brandham spoke of
[14:08] the time this message which he was
[14:10] bringing is is a jubilee message.
[14:15] And at the time and he referred to the
[14:16] in the Old Testament that there was a
[14:18] time of Jubilee when a a trumpet was
[14:21] being blown. A sound was coming was
[14:24] being made. And at that sound you could
[14:27] do one of two things.
[14:30] You could go free
[14:32] &gt;&gt; or you could stay in your slavery.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; And slavery is really uh there it can be
[14:40] a lot of things. We could just be
[14:41] enslaved to our own our own idea, our
[14:44] own complex or or our sickness or to uh
[14:49] who knows what or our sin or whatever
[14:51] more our flesh ourself. But tonight I
[14:55] believe and I I feel this very very
[14:57] strong upon my heart tonight as brother
[15:01] Ron Spencer comes to speak. I believe
[15:04] that he is ordained of God for this
[15:06] moment.
[15:08] The trumpet sound of the message has
[15:11] already sounded
[15:14] &gt;&gt; and we all at some time or other I
[15:17] expect have heard it and you upon
[15:21] hearing the sound
[15:23] you can do one of two things. You can
[15:26] accept it, believe it and be free. I
[15:31] mean free
[15:32] &gt;&gt; not in a word f re e e but you can be
[15:35] free.
[15:39] Hallelujah.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Or you can just stay the way you are.
[15:43] And brother Brandham said that person
[15:44] who just wanted to stay, they would get
[15:47] bore with an all in their ear and then
[15:50] they couldn't hardly hear anything else.
[15:52] And I'd like to take this moment and
[15:53] just read this read this quote before we
[15:56] pray.
[15:58] He said, "Notice
[16:00] the Messiah standing in the platform to
[16:05] identify himself with the word of
[16:07] promise for that age."
[16:10] &gt;&gt; And tonight,
[16:11] the Messiah, not brother Ron Spencer,
[16:14] but the word that is preached is the
[16:17] Messiah.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; The Messiah, I want to announce to you,
[16:21] the Messiah will be here at the platform
[16:23] this evening. Furthermore, I'll say the
[16:25] Messiah is at the platform.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "How strange the Messiah
[16:34] standing up before the church and look
[16:38] at these precious words when he says
[16:41] here to preach the acceptable year, the
[16:45] acceptable year of the Lord." And he
[16:47] said, "The acceptable year of Jubilee,
[16:51] when the all slaves and prisoners, no
[16:53] matter how long they've been in bondage,
[16:57] &gt;&gt; or how long they were supposed to stay
[17:00] there, when the year come
[17:03] uh of the Jubilee,
[17:05] when the trumpet sounded,
[17:08] &gt;&gt; every man,
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; could go free
[17:12] &gt;&gt; if he wanted to go free.
[17:15] Amen.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; You're free.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; You were no more a slave.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; But if you desired to remain a slave,
[17:24] &gt;&gt; God
[17:25] &gt;&gt; said if you desired to remain a slave,
[17:27] then you had to go and be taken to the
[17:30] temple to the temple post and have your
[17:33] ear with an all board. He said, "What a
[17:37] perfect example." Now, folks, we're not
[17:40] just here having this family camp
[17:43] service.
[17:45] I feel if that's what we're here for,
[17:48] it's a failure.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; We're here for a different purpose.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; We're here because God sent a message
[17:57] and there is no other message like it.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; There's no other message that's had this
[18:01] kind of vindication. When the when the
[18:04] messenger of this evening, brother
[18:06] Spencer, comes and stands behind this
[18:08] pulpit, just remember one thing. He is
[18:11] speaking on the basis and his authority
[18:14] is from a message that God vindicated.
[18:17] That's why I say the Messiah
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; God vindicated. And a prophet says,
[18:23] "What a perfect example it is of the
[18:26] gospel of Jesus Christ when it's
[18:28] preached, the acceptable time and the
[18:32] time of Jubilee." And I thought tonight,
[18:34] I wonder, Lord, there's going to be a
[18:36] jubilee for somebody. Amen.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Anybody, no matter who you are,
[18:46] &gt;&gt; what color you are, what denomination
[18:49] you belong to, how far you've been
[18:52] stopped, how far you've stooped in sin,
[18:55] or what's wrong with you. You can go
[18:57] free when you hear God's gospel trumpet
[19:01] sound. You are free.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you turn your back upon the
[19:06] message, that's the two things.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; You are free. That's number one.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; But if you turn your back on the
[19:14] message, he said if you turn your back
[19:16] on the message and refuse to hear it,
[19:20] notice he says you're bored in the air
[19:22] with an all. And that means to say that
[19:25] you've crossed the line between grace
[19:27] and judgment and you will never hear the
[19:31] gospel again. And he said, "You never
[19:33] get any further. You must be a slave to
[19:36] the system."
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the system is just our own
[19:40] system.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Don't have any preconceived idea
[19:44] tonight.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; We're not here to have any special kind
[19:47] of, you know, whip up.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; We're not We're not here to have a bunch
[19:53] of emotionalism. We're here to have you
[19:56] prepared to hear the Messiah.
[20:00] You believe it's the Messiah?
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; It is indeed.
[20:06] And I'd like to sing. Brother Ryan, if
[20:09] you would please. Set I found.
[20:14] Would you do that? And then, Brother
[20:18] Tim Dodd, if you would come, we have
[20:20] three uh urgent burdens or uh two very
[20:25] urgent in fact. Brother Gay, our sister
[20:28] Barb Drake's father
[20:31] uh has perhaps one week or two weeks to
[20:34] live.
[20:35] And uh tonight uh two of the daughters,
[20:38] Sister Barb sisters, left this morning
[20:40] to go to be with him. And so we want to
[20:44] pray for brother Gay that God's will,
[20:47] perfect will be done. And this is what
[20:50] we're asking. We just don't want him to
[20:52] suffer. If God's to take him at this
[20:54] time, then may he go in peace.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; And if he's to remain, may he be
[21:00] restored quickly.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Sister Litty, if she was sitting here
[21:06] this evening, you would admire her.
[21:09] She's a wonderful sister. She may be
[21:11] streaming the meeting this evening. Uh
[21:14] she's in Switzerland
[21:16] and uh she and her husband Daniel have
[21:19] been very very instrumental in the
[21:21] meetings. uh in Switzerland and she does
[21:24] a lot of work just like some of the
[21:26] young sisters around here. She has some
[21:29] kind of muscular thing. The doctors
[21:31] can't discover what it is. And I sent
[21:34] him an email today and I said it might
[21:36] hide from the doctors. That's what the
[21:37] prophet said. But it can't hide from
[21:39] God. Can we say amen to that?
[21:43] &gt;&gt; God bless our sister Lyd with a healing.
[21:46] Brother Tim, as you pray, brother Jim
[21:48] Weber, he had a bit of an accident
[21:50] today. He was not hurt. We're thankful
[21:52] for that. But he got bumped around and
[21:55] the brakes failed in his truck and the
[21:58] truck rolled over. We understand. But
[22:00] he's he's fine. But he's got uh you
[22:03] can't have a something like that happen
[22:05] without it being, you know, shaking you
[22:07] up a bit. So we want to pray for brother
[22:09] Jim and God will just be near him. And
[22:12] then there's been uh some have gotten
[22:15] sick here at the camp and we just know
[22:17] that the enemy, he hates what we're
[22:20] doing. And so we want to pray that God
[22:23] will just overshadow this camp. And
[22:25] brother
[22:27] Tim, if you would come while we sing
[22:29] this chorus, please.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Said
[22:37] love that.
[22:41] Would you stand please? said, "I found
[22:45] some struggle
[22:55] my weakness."
[22:59] Oh, I found grace to cover all my sins.
[23:06] It's in Jesus.
[23:09] It's in Jesus.
[23:14] Jesus.
[23:18] Jesus.
[23:30] foundation
[23:34] is in Jesus.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we pray?
[23:45] Heavenly Father,
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, how we love you. Lord,
[23:50] &gt;&gt; how we thank you, Father, that you are
[23:52] the center of our lives.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have quickened us to that
[23:58] fact. And
[23:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe that everybody here in
[24:02] this room, you are the center of their
[24:04] life. But Father, it may be
[24:06] &gt;&gt; that some have not been quickened to
[24:08] that fact yet. They have not been
[24:10] quickened that Lord, you were in they
[24:13] were in your mind before the foundation
[24:15] of the world. Lord, maybe this is their
[24:18] night.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, may you draw near unto us tonight.
[24:23] Lord, may you draw near unto us in these
[24:26] meetings as has been requested, Father.
[24:29] Lord, may you take, Lord, one thing we
[24:32] would request, Father, is we would see
[24:34] your sovereignty, Lord, for you are
[24:37] sovereign, oh God.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; And Lord, let the mind of man be uh put
[24:42] to shame and let the mind of Christ be
[24:45] exalted in these meetings, in this
[24:47] weekend. Lord, we welcome you to have
[24:50] the preeminence.
[24:52] And Lord, we're needy people, oh God.
[24:55] Lord, you know our hearts. Oh, Father,
[24:57] we thank you that you know our hearts.
[24:59] You know the secrets that we don't have
[25:01] to put it on paper. We don't have to
[25:04] make our requests understandable by our
[25:06] words. Because many times, Father, we
[25:09] would fail with our words to express to
[25:11] you. But Lord, you know the deepest
[25:13] regions of our lives and our needs, our
[25:16] burdens, our desires. Lord, our
[25:18] yearnings towards you, as has been said
[25:21] this morning, our groanings, oh God.
[25:24] Lord, I pray that you'll meet every
[25:26] groaning, every yearning, Lord. Every
[25:29] burden, every question, Lord. And Lord,
[25:32] there's some needs tonight very specific
[25:35] and urgent, Lord. It would it wouldn't
[25:37] have been mentioned if they weren't
[25:39] urgent, Father. And Lord, we're
[25:41] remembering our brother Gay tonight.
[25:43] Lord, we're asking Lord for your perfect
[25:46] will in his life.
[25:48] Lord,
[25:50] &gt;&gt; we ask, oh God, that you'd your hand
[25:52] would be upon him for your will to be
[25:54] done. Lord, if it be to take him home,
[25:57] your will, Father, we we are not their
[26:00] sorrow as them that have no hope, Lord.
[26:03] But Lord, we know you have a purpose in
[26:05] all things. But Lord, if it be your will
[26:08] that he would stay with us, raise him
[26:10] up, Father. Lord, we're asking, oh God,
[26:13] that you'll sovereignly touch him
[26:16] &gt;&gt; for your perfect will to be done. We
[26:18] ask, Lord, for the sister, Lord, that
[26:21] the devil has tried to hide. He is a
[26:23] defeated foe. Lord, you paid the price
[26:27] for all healing 2,000 years ago. Lord,
[26:30] in your mind, it's a finished work. And
[26:33] we accept the mind of Christ tonight.
[26:35] May our sister accept it. And Lord, may
[26:38] she be completely loosed even now.
[26:40] Father, may the enemy be driven from
[26:43] her, Lord. As your scripture says, even
[26:45] if there be any sin, she might not even
[26:47] know, Lord, may it be forgiven her,
[26:49] Lord. Lord, let your grace rest upon her
[26:52] life.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask for our brother that's been
[26:56] in the accident, Father. Lord, you know
[26:58] him, Lord. Let him be loosed, Father,
[27:02] from every upset and every ill feeling,
[27:05] oh God. Lord, may he have perfect
[27:07] liberty, oh God. May he walk away now
[27:10] perfectly clear in conscience, in mind,
[27:12] in body. And Lord, may you just give him
[27:14] that that uh blessing upon his life that
[27:17] he needs at this time of the urgency. So
[27:19] we commit ourselves to you. We commit
[27:21] the song service. We commit brother
[27:23] Spencer to you Lord because Lord we want
[27:27] father that you will use him for our
[27:28] benefit and for the glory of the name of
[27:31] Jesus Christ. We ask it in that holy
[27:34] name, the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[27:38] Amen.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Bless you. You can have your seats.
[27:44] We're just going to prepare to take the
[27:46] offering. Our brother Tom's going to
[27:48] come. And just as we prepare to do that,
[27:50] why don't we sing, I just want to thank
[27:52] you, Lord, for letting me hear your
[27:53] word. Aren't you thankful that you've
[27:55] heard?
[27:56] &gt;&gt; You think of all the people in the
[27:58] earth. There's a chosen few, and God saw
[28:00] fit to let us be a part of that. How can
[28:02] you have a bad day when you think about
[28:03] that? Amen. So, let's sing this. I just
[28:06] want to thank you, Lord. Oh, I just want
[28:09] to thank you Lord
[28:12] for letting me hear your word.
[28:18] What have I done to deserve such glory
[28:23] reveal in me
[28:28] for that special
[28:38] to
[28:48] And I just want
[28:50] you
[29:01] to s
[29:08] for that special
[29:13] when I saw your glorious
[29:18] face to face with eternal life.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; One more time. I just want to thank you
[29:27] Lord. I just want to thank you Lord
[29:32] for letting me hear your word.
[29:38] What have I done to you
[29:48] for that special
[29:58] face with eternal life?
[30:06] Hallelujah.
[30:08] Glory.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; We're coming to the time of the
[30:12] offering.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Well, you can look at it one or two
[30:16] ways. You can take you can keep playing.
[30:21] You can take it look like it's maybe
[30:22] some sort of burden
[30:25] or you can make it a love offering
[30:27] &gt;&gt; to the Lord.
[30:30] There's always two types of people in
[30:33] the world.
[30:34] There's givers and there's takers.
[30:41] You say, "Well, I just came to camp,
[30:42] show up, and I want the blessing."
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Well,
[30:46] I could be a taker,
[30:49] but I want to do the giving tonight,
[30:50] saints. I want to give everything that I
[30:53] can. I have come here to meet the living
[30:56] God. And I know he's poured out
[30:59] everything and has given everything to
[31:02] us that we might benefit his glory and
[31:04] grace.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; And so we come to an offering. It
[31:07] shouldn't be, oh, there's an offering
[31:08] and say, "Oh, God, this is a part of
[31:10] worship. Let me give my offering.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Let me give my offering. Whatever I can
[31:14] do for the kingdom, young people, we
[31:16] need to learn this.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; This is a a love offering to the Lord."
[31:21] and that there are of course expenses
[31:23] that come with meetings, but Lord, we
[31:26] want to give it back to you. You've
[31:27] given so much to me, and I'm expecting
[31:29] that God's going to pour down his grace
[31:31] and open the windows of heaven upon my
[31:33] soul. Can I do my part of worship?
[31:37] And can I give a little something back
[31:39] to you, Lord?
[31:41] Don't be a taker only. Why don't you be
[31:44] a giver tonight? And thank God that you
[31:47] have an opportunity, young people. Let's
[31:49] just bow our heads and ask the Lord to
[31:51] bless this offering tonight. Father,
[31:55] how we have
[31:58] prayed and saints have laid on their
[32:00] face.
[32:02] Parents have sacrificed.
[32:04] I would say they're not the takers,
[32:05] they're the givers.
[32:07] They've given much. They've sacrificed
[32:10] their lives, their time, and now we're
[32:14] here in this wonderful setting. We have
[32:17] wondered people, the redeemed of God.
[32:20] And so, Lord, this is going to be an
[32:21] offering that we we give. Would you
[32:23] bless the giver,
[32:26] Lord Jesus, that you will take this
[32:29] offering and multiply it abundantly for
[32:33] the kingdom of God. We thank you for
[32:35] everyone that is here. So, Lord, we're
[32:37] just praying now that your grace and
[32:39] your blessing be upon each and everyone
[32:41] now at this time. In Jesus' name, we
[32:45] give you thanks. Amen. God bless you as
[32:48] you give. Amen.
[33:01] Light of the world, you step down into
[33:08] darkness.
[33:10] Open my eyes. Let me see.
[33:17] For such beauty
[33:20] that makes
[33:22] this heart
[33:24] adore you.
[33:26] Joy of the lives
[33:30] with you. Oh here I am to worship.
[33:36] Here I am to bow.
[33:40] Here I am to see that you're my God.

[34:35] for me.
[34:51] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[35:01] Never
[35:08] know
[35:12] just how much it cost
[35:17] to see

[37:11] Just sing one more time.

[37:26] that you're my God.
[37:31] All together

[38:18] Hallelujah.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name, Lord Jesus.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, that's why we've come here
[38:27] tonight, oh God. Lord, to give of
[38:30] ourselves, oh God.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just want to worship you
[38:35] tonight, oh God, in spirit and in truth,
[38:37] Father.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, from the depths of our souls,
[38:41] there's such a desire and a craving, oh
[38:43] God. Lord, that you would be exalted,
[38:47] &gt;&gt; that you would be made manifest in our
[38:49] midst tonight. Oh God,
[38:51] &gt;&gt; come, oh God, we pray, Lord,
[38:54] &gt;&gt; blessed be your name, oh Jesus.
[38:56] Hallelujah.
[38:58] We don't want to interrupt this
[38:59] atmosphere. Oh Lord, we just want to
[39:01] sing a song for you before we turn to
[39:03] the word tonight. Just invite you to
[39:05] worship along with us. Those of you that
[39:06] know it, please just sing along with us.
[39:08] God bless you. You can have your seats.
[39:52] I slipped through the gates of pearl as
[39:58] Peter greed me.
[40:03] And one by one I met the saints I'd long
[40:09] so much to see.
[40:13] I saw my hero Steven,
[40:19] Paul and Timothy.
[40:23] But before my breath could find the
[40:27] words, I heard them speak
[40:32] to me.
[40:36] Are you she
[40:39] the bride of the last days
[40:44] who stood the worst of times
[40:48] when so many slipped away.
[40:55] Here's your crown.
[40:59] Take your place beside the throne.
[41:04] Christ is now your very own.
[41:09] Is this the special chosen one we see?
[41:20] Are you
[41:35] was the worst of all the ages.
[41:40] They continue
[41:42] to say,
[41:45] "How did you live a Christian life
[41:50] in such a godless day?"
[41:55] But question after question
[42:00] my heroes lifted me
[42:04] and I heard a voice behind me
[42:10] whisper
[42:12] tenderly
[42:17] is she
[42:19] the bride of the last days
[42:24] who stood the worst of times
[42:29] when so many slipped away.
[42:34] Here's your crown
[42:38] to take your place beside the throne.
[42:44] I am now your very own.
[42:48] This is the special chosen one we see
[42:54] for the chosen one.
[42:59] This is she.
[43:05] These trials that you're facing
[43:11] may seem so big and tall,
[43:15] but when we hear the master speak, it'll
[43:21] make it worth it all.
[43:26] Worth it all.
[43:30] You worship
[43:34] the ride of the last days.
[43:40] The worst time
[43:43] when so many slipp away
[43:49] your
[43:53] praise.
[43:57] Christ is now your very own.
[44:01] This is the special chosen one.
[44:07] You're the chosen one.
[44:12] You worship.
[44:21] You worship.
[44:46] Wonderful. Thank you for that wonderful
[44:48] song.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; For the hours you've taken or
[44:51] practicing. God bless you. We're going
[44:53] to turn to the word.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron,
[45:01] not only thank you for coming,
[45:04] we thank God for sparing this man.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Not once, but more than
[45:19] we believe that God spared you for us.
[45:22] Amen.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Besides your people at home, but for us
[45:26] &gt;&gt; and for tonight, folks,
[45:28] &gt;&gt; I believe that God has given him words.
[45:30] I do believe that God has given them
[45:32] words. I have no idea what he's going to
[45:35] speak on, but I'm taking it to myself. I
[45:38] want to hear words from heaven,
[45:41] &gt;&gt; sir.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; I want to consecrate myself a new.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; I want to be a blessing to someone else.
[45:48] Come, brother Ron. Take your liberty
[45:51] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[46:04] Amen. We love the Lord.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's certainly good to us, isn't
[46:09] he?
[46:10] &gt;&gt; We are. We're so thrilled just to be
[46:12] here.
[46:14] I would term it one of the highest
[46:16] honors in the whole world, just to be
[46:18] able to stand here with you. And uh we
[46:22] love you with all of our hearts.
[46:24] But the reason we're all here is to
[46:27] serve him. Amen.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't felt the presence of
[46:31] the Lord here already this afternoon,
[46:33] you're numb.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you would stand with me this
[46:38] evening,
[46:39] I'd like to just go directly to the
[46:41] word. And
[46:45] so glad to have Sister Connie with me
[46:47] and then my daughter, Sister Whitney and
[46:50] Sister Autumn from our church. And so
[46:53] good to see each and every one of you
[46:55] friends. And uh what a family reunion we
[46:58] have here.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just a just a real time in the
[47:02] Lord. How many has come under
[47:04] expectation for this week
[47:07] &gt;&gt; that the Lord Jesus would come to you?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; We've come with an expectation, Lord,
[47:14] before this week is over.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; We'd like to spend just a little time
[47:18] with you. Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I I stood yesterday at an hour
[47:23] at an airport counter waiting for a man
[47:27] just to look up
[47:29] an hour. I watched my watch. He was very
[47:32] diligent not to look up at all. And I
[47:35] waited cuz I was as patient as he was
[47:40] patient not looking at me.
[47:45] But our Lord Jesus is waiting on us.
[47:48] Amen.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; And let's just invite him to where we're
[47:51] at just now.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; May he come and speak to our hearts and
[47:56] anoint our lips.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, this meeting has been set aside
[48:03] and much work has went in.
[48:07] But Lord, we realize that we're the
[48:09] physical attributes of God that you
[48:11] thought of before the foundation of the
[48:13] world.
[48:15] And there is a gathering that's going on
[48:17] here even this afternoon.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you know exactly what our
[48:22] needs are.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; You know exactly what the conditions are
[48:26] in our lives.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; And you know, Father, what we're
[48:29] struggling with and what we're fighting.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; But Lord, the answer to every one of our
[48:35] problems is more of you.
[48:38] Lord, if you would just come tonight,
[48:41] &gt;&gt; forgive us of our sins,
[48:43] &gt;&gt; our mistakes. Father,
[48:45] &gt;&gt; I have no one to blame, but Lord, I ask
[48:47] you that you would forgive me, dear God.
[48:51] Lord, if you would just come and anoint
[48:53] these lips one more time and this body,
[48:56] Father, we come to this predestinated
[48:59] moment. And we ask you that you would
[49:02] anoint our lives, Lord, for the service
[49:04] of your kingdom.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Not just as a speaker, but also as a
[49:08] hearer, Father. And wherever these words
[49:12] would echo, Lord, tonight, I pray that
[49:15] they would reach their mark, dear God.
[49:18] May they be effective, Father. Lord,
[49:21] these are your words. And I ask you that
[49:23] you would just minister to us. Bridle
[49:26] our tongues. Bridle our minds tonight,
[49:29] Lord. Lord, those that have traveled so
[49:32] far and their bodies may be weary. May
[49:35] you refresh them in your presence
[49:36] tonight. Help us, we pray in Jesus
[49:40] Christ's name we ask. Amen. And amen.
[49:43] Amen. If you will turn with me in your
[49:45] scriptures this afternoon to Luke
[49:47] chapter 7
[49:49] this evening.
[49:54] Luke 7 and verse 36.
[50:03] And I would like to look this afternoon
[50:05] at the invitation
[50:09] if I could
[50:11] this afternoon.
[50:14] Luke 7 and verse 36.
[50:20] And one of the Pharisees desired him
[50:24] that he would eat with him.
[50:26] And he went into the Pharisees house and
[50:29] sat down to meet.
[50:31] And behold, a woman in the city, which
[50:34] was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus
[50:37] sat at me in the Pharisees house,
[50:40] brought an alabaster box of ointment,
[50:43] and stood at his feet behind him
[50:45] weeping, and began to wash his feet with
[50:48] tears, and did wipe them with the hairs
[50:51] of her head, and kissed his feet, and
[50:54] anointed them with ointment. And when
[50:56] the Pharisee which had been bidden him
[50:59] saw it, he spake within himself, saying,
[51:03] "This man,
[51:05] if he were a prophet,
[51:08] would have known who and what manner of
[51:12] woman this is that touched him."
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:16] &gt;&gt; For she is a sinner. You may be seated
[51:20] this evening.
[51:29] Brother Brandham uses this text in many
[51:33] different places and for many different
[51:35] purposes
[51:39] and I would like to just spend just a
[51:41] few moments with it this afternoon. And
[51:45] brother Brandham said that our Lord
[51:48] Jesus
[51:50] was possibly up on a heel heaven meeting
[51:53] and
[51:55] no doubt he was had delivered some words
[51:57] of
[51:59] maybe from even the biatitudes.
[52:02] Blessed is the pouring spirit for theirs
[52:04] is the kingdom of heaven. and hundreds
[52:07] and maybe even thousands had gathered on
[52:10] this hill to to be be a part of this
[52:13] ministry. And they were watching the
[52:16] word become made flesh. And no doubt as
[52:19] they were there and many were sick were
[52:21] just pressing their way to where he was
[52:23] at.
[52:25] And as they were going, as they were
[52:26] working their way, maybe if they could
[52:28] just get a time with him and they could
[52:30] just press their way to where he's at.
[52:32] if they could get a disciple's
[52:34] attention, you know, pray for my mother,
[52:36] pray for my brother, pray for me, I have
[52:39] incredible need, anything that they
[52:41] could do to get close to him.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; They just wanted his eyes to fall upon
[52:46] them
[52:47] &gt;&gt; that their need could be met.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; The more they saw, the more their faith
[52:52] rose.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Now, there was another young man that
[52:55] was headed towards this meeting. He was
[52:58] a courier. He had a message. He had a
[53:00] cause to be here. And now he has a he
[53:04] has a boss that has is arranging a great
[53:09] gayla, a great dinner. He's invited the
[53:12] celebrities of all of the city and as of
[53:15] any of these events, he's he's got the
[53:17] social gatherings and everything and
[53:20] everything's going to be perfectly set
[53:21] up. But on this occasion, brother Tim,
[53:24] he wants to invite Jesus of Nazareth.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; He has a purpose. He has an agenda
[53:30] &gt;&gt; in his mind to bring him there.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; And so he sends out this courier and and
[53:36] brother Brandham says he would run for
[53:38] maybe days looking and searching the
[53:41] heels and searching where he may have
[53:43] been and searching for testimony of if
[53:46] the Jesus had been there and he was just
[53:49] doing whatever he could to get to where
[53:50] he was at. And as he comes towards the
[53:53] meeting, he's very he's very impatient.
[53:56] He's making his way. And brother man
[53:58] said, "I can see him." And excuse me, I
[54:00] just I just want to be a repeater here
[54:01] just for a little while. Brother man
[54:03] says, "I can see him as he as he makes
[54:05] his way towards towards Jesus." And he
[54:09] said, "The disciples see him coming and
[54:11] they stop him." And they stopping and
[54:14] maybe want to know his business and and
[54:16] he begins to tell him in quite an
[54:18] excited for fashion of of Jesus of
[54:21] Nazareth now has been invited to to the
[54:24] to this Pharisees house. And what an
[54:27] honor it would be for Jesus to come. And
[54:30] it would and it would no doubt that if
[54:32] Jesus would come, you know, he's he's
[54:35] bringing him the greatest invitation
[54:36] that he could possibly bring Jesus to be
[54:40] able to come and set at meet at this
[54:42] great celebration that is getting ready
[54:44] to take place. Not knowing really who he
[54:48] was inviting,
[54:51] &gt;&gt; not knowing what was really getting
[54:54] ready to take place.
[54:57] Come on,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham. I especially today I
[55:00] heard him say this courier had an
[55:03] opportunity
[55:04] &gt;&gt; with the Lord
[55:08] &gt;&gt; and his cause was more important
[55:12] &gt;&gt; than taking the opportunity with the
[55:15] Lord Jesus for the greater purpose.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; His boss's cause, the invitation was
[55:22] more important than getting what he
[55:24] really needed.
[55:26] I pray that in this meeting
[55:29] &gt;&gt; that we have come with the right purpose
[55:33] &gt;&gt; that we have come that when he comes on
[55:36] the scene to where we're at
[55:38] &gt;&gt; that we take this opportunity
[55:41] &gt;&gt; whether we're young or the oldest in
[55:43] this building to draw nearer to him.
[55:50] No doubt Peter being the way that he was
[55:52] and his disposition the way it was, he
[55:55] just kind of kind of shoved him aside.
[55:56] There's more important pressing things
[55:58] here already formulated in his mind
[56:01] maybe speaking with Andrew. No way that
[56:03] the Lord will go.
[56:06] No way the Lord will go. He's he's busy
[56:08] about this and and I can see as this
[56:11] courier, he's just waiting for his
[56:13] opportunity to step up. And when it
[56:16] comes his time, he steps up and he
[56:18] begins to deliver this great witness
[56:21] that he's getting ready to do that
[56:24] you're invited to come at a certain
[56:26] time. You to come and be with us and so
[56:30] and so is going to be there and so and
[56:31] so is going to be there and we want to
[56:33] have you as a guest there. And he begins
[56:36] to deliver it with all of his heart.
[56:39] And no doubt others are sitting waiting
[56:41] for him to be rebuked and he says, "I'll
[56:44] come.
[56:51] I'll come.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; He's going to a place that he calls f
[56:57] their fathers devils.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; He calls them hypocrites.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Whited supplers.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Now he's getting ready to go to their
[57:08] place where they're at.
[57:10] No doubt in their own mind they cannot
[57:12] understand
[57:14] even what is the purpose of why he's
[57:16] even going.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Here is much business to be done. Here
[57:21] is a people that love him. Here's a
[57:23] people that are just looking for the
[57:25] opportunity just get near him. Now he's
[57:27] going to leave this scene and he's going
[57:29] to go to this great social occasion. But
[57:32] you see as a man we can't see what's
[57:34] going on.
[57:36] We can't see what God is gathering in
[57:38] another dimension.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we can't even understand how
[57:43] he gathers this one and gathers this
[57:44] one. And and maybe we don't even
[57:47] understand even why we're here this
[57:48] evening. But God in his infinite mind
[57:53] &gt;&gt; knows exactly how to pull us all
[57:55] together to speak to one person.
[58:01] Hallelujah.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; I can see as the scene is beginning to
[58:05] set in the
[58:07] &gt;&gt; brother said this little girl from the
[58:09] city. She goes out and the streets are
[58:11] empty.
[58:13] Just down in a certain place where this
[58:16] is all to be set at. There are chariots
[58:20] gathering and and men gathering with all
[58:24] different kinds of thing and great work
[58:25] has went into this evening
[58:28] and they've gathered there and all the
[58:30] socialites.
[58:32] All the people that are called the who's
[58:34] who
[58:35] &gt;&gt; the people that are supposed to be
[58:37] impressed with other people and and eyes
[58:40] on humanity. They've gathered and
[58:42] they're just so thrilled that they can
[58:44] have their socialite reunion, you know,
[58:46] and they're tipping their wine glasses
[58:49] and talking about their businesses and
[58:52] and what's going on in the community and
[58:55] no doubt politics is coming up and no
[58:58] doubt as each one would gather as the
[59:01] red carpet would be, they might have an
[59:04] announcer there and and he calls out so
[59:07] and so is here. Dr. Jones is here.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; The great lawyer is here and they're
[59:14] gathering and no doubt hand applause
[59:16] goes and then they would come to the
[59:18] footwash flunky and they would get a new
[59:21] robe and they would get a perfume and
[59:25] they'd get washed up. There'd be great
[59:28] announcement and incredible welcoming
[59:31] that would go on and it was a special
[59:33] committee set up to take care of this
[59:36] welcoming.
[59:37] Yeah.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; And as they're gathering, no doubt
[59:40] they're making sure that one another's
[59:41] gathering. You going or you going or you
[59:43] going? Well, it'll be a special time.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; And now now the disciples are also
[59:50] coming.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; They're walking with the master.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; No doubt some gravels are being kicked
[59:56] and dirt being kicked wondering why he's
[59:59] even going.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; They're making their way. It's not just
[1:00:03] a normal little jaunt down the road, but
[1:00:05] they're making their way to where where
[1:00:08] this place is at.
[1:00:11] And they're walking and
[1:00:13] the master's just walking among them,
[1:00:15] maybe maybe even just kind of just very
[1:00:20] quietly moving.
[1:00:22] And as he's going, there's a purpose of
[1:00:25] why he's going.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose of why he's going.
[1:00:32] outside the street is full of people.
[1:00:34] Brother B said poor people gathering
[1:00:37] looking to see who's there. Maybe a
[1:00:40] little food will be handed out once
[1:00:42] everybody begins to be drunken and and
[1:00:46] maybe lambs and meat. And he said the
[1:00:48] air is filled with spices
[1:00:51] and you could just smell it, the
[1:00:52] anticipation, the excitement of the
[1:00:54] event.
[1:00:56] And now Jesus is making his way towards
[1:00:58] where they're at. Their
[1:01:02] heads are not so turned when he walks
[1:01:04] into their midst,
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; As he begins to make his way, maybe
[1:01:09] rubbing shoulders with one another and
[1:01:11] kind of moving through.
[1:01:14] His name isn't called as they he begins
[1:01:16] to get to the entrance.
[1:01:20] The disciples now can't go with him.
[1:01:23] He makes his way in.
[1:01:26] The footwash flunky avoids him with
[1:01:29] everything that's within him. And you
[1:01:31] can tell when you're being avoided.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; You know, there's just something about
[1:01:36] the spirit of rejection that just falls.
[1:01:38] And the atmosphere is literally
[1:01:41] literally charged with rejection and
[1:01:43] feelings. And you know, our humanity
[1:01:45] plays in that order. And Jesus is having
[1:01:48] to feel this as he makes his way. But
[1:01:51] he's got purpose.
[1:01:54] And you see, you know, he he didn't come
[1:01:57] for to be applauded by men. Now,
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; they came to be applauded by men.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; And listen, listen. There's objectives.
[1:02:07] We're not here to be praised by man.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; We're here to praise God.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; He begins to make his way through the
[1:02:16] through the scene and spectators are
[1:02:18] looking and why is he even here? Yeah.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; And he can hear the moans and the groans
[1:02:23] from the people and the rejection and
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; and he can hear them. Look at there.
[1:02:29] Why? He's came and they didn't even give
[1:02:31] him a robe. They didn't wash his feet.
[1:02:34] No doubt outside there. They're making
[1:02:36] mention. Look what's happening now.
[1:02:39] As he makes his way, he's he looks for a
[1:02:42] spot and he settles himself in a corner
[1:02:45] and a corner over by side and he's kind
[1:02:47] of just sitting there scanning the room.
[1:02:50] Listen. Our all knowing Messiah
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; sitting there
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; patiently waiting.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; There's a pull. There's a leading.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; As he's beginning to scan the room, he's
[1:03:06] watching for the purpose of why I'm
[1:03:08] here.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Because he's did what his promise was to
[1:03:12] keep his appointments. He keeps them
[1:03:15] all.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; He goes wherever he's invited.
[1:03:22] There's great work by humanity that's
[1:03:24] went into this event, but they really
[1:03:26] don't know that they were orchestrated
[1:03:29] by God to bring in a predestinated seat.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; As he begins to set, no doubt now
[1:03:37] there's no drinks handed his way.
[1:03:40] There's no orderves handed his way.
[1:03:42] There's no food handed his way. I'm sure
[1:03:45] as the as as they're talking once among
[1:03:49] another they're kind of looking over
[1:03:51] their shoulders seeing him over there
[1:03:53] dusty clothes and no doubt no doubt he's
[1:03:58] been very weary from the journey and
[1:04:01] they're watching him and they're kind of
[1:04:04] making small talk and laughing and
[1:04:06] saying different things about him.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Now let's just look through his eyes
[1:04:11] just for a few moments.
[1:04:14] cuz these eyes have met some of these
[1:04:17] same people
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; it was these kind of people that brought
[1:04:21] a little woman one day
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; to tempt him
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; and they they had it they had a law that
[1:04:32] this woman should be stoned
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; and as they brought him there they
[1:04:38] brought this woman listen they broke
[1:04:41] their own law they should have brought
[1:04:42] the man and the woman.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; But they they came and they brought this
[1:04:48] woman. Now the scripture says that Jesus
[1:04:52] spoke to them, "He that is without sin,
[1:04:56] cast the first stone."
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; He doesn't speak an incredibly long
[1:05:01] sermon to them,
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; but just his mere presence,
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; brings a conviction on them. Listen,
[1:05:09] they could go to church and didn't feel
[1:05:11] that kind of conviction.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; They could go to their synagogues and
[1:05:17] read the the the script of Ezekiel and
[1:05:20] Jeremiah and stand in the temple all day
[1:05:23] long with their allas and and their
[1:05:25] their their their sacrifices.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; But this man has a presence about him.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; This man's got an atmosphere about him.
[1:05:36] This man literally he literally commands
[1:05:39] a presence about him.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; He simply says he that is without sin
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; cast the first stone.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Now these people call themselves the
[1:05:56] holiest of holy people.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Why? They no doubt carry their own
[1:06:01] records and their own their own their
[1:06:03] own sorceries and and everything about
[1:06:06] them and they they consider themselves
[1:06:08] holier,
[1:06:10] the the stock of Israel.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; But only a few days ago, the prophet
[1:06:18] stood on the banks of a Jordan
[1:06:22] and is telling them that your sacrifices
[1:06:26] are not much longer going to be
[1:06:27] accepted. Right?
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Because there's one cometh,
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; the lamb of God
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; that will take away the sins of the
[1:06:37] world.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; There's coming a time when you won't
[1:06:41] need to offer up lambs and turtles,
[1:06:43] doves, and you won't have to identify
[1:06:46] yourself with that sacrifice anymore.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; But God sending a kinsman redeemer.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The one that can erase sins
[1:06:57] forever
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; by one offering.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, I can hear John as he preaches
[1:07:04] it with a revelation in his heart and
[1:07:07] sent to introduce that one.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saw the hypocrisy in the
[1:07:13] church.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; He saw there was no reality. He saw
[1:07:17] there was no life.
[1:07:22] and God's getting ready to change that
[1:07:24] whole order of that
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; all the way from Adam coming out of the
[1:07:30] Garden of Eden. Listen, I just read
[1:07:32] brother Brandham said God spoke to Adam
[1:07:35] and said not only did he cast them out,
[1:07:37] he said, but God even said, "I'll go
[1:07:39] with you."
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:46] Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Here's a woman in her condition, not
[1:07:52] denying her condition.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Here's a woman in her condition,
[1:07:58] standing there before the Lord.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; And he begins to write on the sand.
[1:08:04] The scripture says they were convicted
[1:08:06] by their own conscience.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And here's here he is sitting in the
[1:08:14] corner.
[1:08:17] and he's standing in the room
[1:08:20] and he's watching.
[1:08:24] That same kind of gift was in Misha
[1:08:26] Walker
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; and there was a real Christian and there
[1:08:30] was a hypocrite.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; That same gift was set in in standing
[1:08:36] prayer lines. Right.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; And look at a man say, "You're wanting
[1:08:41] this the Holy Ghost
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; if you'll take the tobaca out of your
[1:08:45] left back pocket
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; of your inner pants.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; You're wearing two pair of pants of your
[1:08:52] inner pants. You've hid that. If you'll
[1:08:54] get rid of that tobaca, God will give
[1:08:56] you the Holy Ghost."
[1:09:02] That same mechc
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; that talked to Abraham,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; that's the same one that was sitting in
[1:09:09] the room.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; And he was sitting and he was staring
[1:09:13] looking at these so-called Pharisees,
[1:09:16] religious men,
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; that was looking for a Messiah
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; that had an order in their mind of what
[1:09:23] he would be like. And he was there.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; He was sitting there. and they were
[1:09:30] missing it.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Now, there's another little girl. She's
[1:09:38] she's a part of this scene.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And she she goes down the street,
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; she sees the gayla going on,
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; She spots in there what's going on. No
[1:09:53] doubt she can see through a certain
[1:09:55] place. And she can sense. She's
[1:09:59] consented some things. No doubt some of
[1:10:01] those men have been at her house.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Listen, she knew what reality was.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Those those men, those religious men,
[1:10:14] they didn't have reality.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; But she too had heard rumors
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; about this one. And she saw something in
[1:10:23] him sitting there.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there was a deep calling
[1:10:27] on the inside of her.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Maybe she was like maybe one of you
[1:10:34] sitting here. She had tried many times
[1:10:36] in her life to reform her life
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; and to resurrect her life and try to
[1:10:40] raise up and be a better person.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Maybe she had tried it on her own
[1:10:46] energies.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe she had tried within herself to
[1:10:49] raise herself up. But let me just say
[1:10:51] this to you. Only God can reach down and
[1:10:53] raise us up.
[1:10:57] Hallelujah.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; There was something on the inside of her
[1:11:01] calling out.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Listen, there was something there. Sin
[1:11:05] didn't satisfy. The things of the world
[1:11:08] didn't satisfy. Listen, all of the
[1:11:10] debauchery and everything that was that
[1:11:14] that was around her. None of that
[1:11:16] satisfied her life. I will tell you sin
[1:11:19] has a thirst that listen no matter how
[1:11:23] far you go in it cannot be quenched.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Lust only gets worse.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Greed only gets worse.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Immorality only gets worse. Perversion
[1:11:35] only gets worse.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here tonight and you say,
[1:11:45] "Well, Brother Ron, I you know I
[1:11:47] You know, I I I I'm not such a bad
[1:11:49] person. Let me just say what a target
[1:11:52] that we are without the spirit of God in
[1:11:54] our life for the devil to destroy.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown met some people on Peg
[1:11:59] Alley. He would ask him, "How did you
[1:12:01] get here?" Maybe a president, a man
[1:12:04] sitting there, it was an alcoholic
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; and he would he would ask him, "How did
[1:12:08] you get here?" Right?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Well, I was the president of the bank. I
[1:12:14] I I I was very successful, but I began
[1:12:18] to take a little social drink.
[1:12:22] He never thought it would make him wind
[1:12:23] up there.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; He never thought of where it would take
[1:12:37] him.
[1:12:40] Maybe maybe if we could just come to
[1:12:42] today
[1:12:44] visiting the wrong internet site.
[1:12:48] We never thought of where it would take
[1:12:50] us.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Chatting with the wrong person. We never
[1:12:55] thought where it would take us.
[1:12:58] Samson never believed getting in bad
[1:13:00] company.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Would wind him up at a meal blind,
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; churning corn,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; being spit on by little kids,
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; being at the very center of a city,
[1:13:14] grinding at a meal. And let me just say,
[1:13:17] every one of us, if we're not careful,
[1:13:20] are targets of an enemy that would like
[1:13:22] to have us grinding at a meal.
[1:13:30] Satan will offer us a whole lot of
[1:13:32] things. Forgive me for just going this
[1:13:34] way just for a few minutes. Just felt
[1:13:36] very led of the Lord to do this. Satan
[1:13:38] will offer you jobs that'll take you
[1:13:39] away from church.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; He'll offer you friendships that'll take
[1:13:43] you away from church.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; He'll take you He'll offer you
[1:13:46] relationships that'll take you away from
[1:13:48] the presence of God.
[1:13:50] He'll bring you under the influence of
[1:13:52] humanity that will pull you from the
[1:13:54] presence of the Lord. Examine your
[1:13:56] friendships.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Examine your relationships.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; If they're not drawing you closer to
[1:14:02] God, are you with me now? If they're not
[1:14:04] drawing you closer to God, examine and
[1:14:07] leave those things.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, examine your own
[1:14:16] attitude as you come to church.
[1:14:18] Are you really getting what you need?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Is it just churchity that is bringing
[1:14:25] you sitting on a pew? Is it just because
[1:14:28] your mother and father are here? Is it
[1:14:30] just because your family's here?
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; If you remember, Cain was a He was a
[1:14:36] religious man.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; He built an altar.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; He did incredible amount of work to make
[1:14:41] it just right.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Well, he was religious. He wanted to do
[1:14:48] the very best job that he could do. But
[1:14:50] brother Brown said, "Watch his
[1:14:52] attitude."
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; When God didn't accept his sacrifice, he
[1:14:57] had an attitude. You can't. That's the
[1:14:59] best that I've got. Take it or leave it.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. If we're not careful,
[1:15:07] we'll refuse to move on.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; We'll refuse to step to a higher
[1:15:11] calling. Brother Ron, I've got it made.
[1:15:13] Let me just say this to you. We're not
[1:15:14] in the rapture just yet.
[1:15:18] Every service we should draw closer to
[1:15:20] him.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Every service we should be looking for
[1:15:23] the voice that is behind the voice. God
[1:15:26] speak to my heart.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; God anoint us.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Let this camp meeting be a complete
[1:15:37] different camp meeting. Not because I'm
[1:15:39] speaking, not because these other
[1:15:41] brothers are speaking, but listen and
[1:15:43] grab a hold of that voice,
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; that presence that is in this building.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Whether you're a minister,
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; no matter who you are,
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; listen, every one of us must be
[1:15:57] challenged. We need more of him.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes sir.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; No doubt.
[1:16:21] No doubt this woman had been offered
[1:16:23] religion.
[1:16:27] I shared with the church the other day,
[1:16:30] Sunday night, I just I just felt just
[1:16:32] completely moved by God to go back
[1:16:36] and and just speak. And I'll just share
[1:16:38] this with you.
[1:16:43] I was raised in the message. My father
[1:16:44] was a preacher. He was here a couple of
[1:16:46] years ago with me. He's very Holy Ghost
[1:16:49] man fil man.
[1:16:52] I was raised listening to the the
[1:16:53] prophet's message every day. I heard it
[1:16:57] every day.
[1:16:59] My brother and I could quote it would
[1:17:02] stand and quote brother Brandham. See
[1:17:04] who could quote the best.
[1:17:09] I played a drum in the church from the
[1:17:12] time I was seven years old.
[1:17:17] We went to church every week,
[1:17:20] two, three, four, five services a week.
[1:17:23] I saw incredible miracles take place,
[1:17:26] phenomenal miracles, heard incredible
[1:17:28] preaching,
[1:17:31] but that didn't save me.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Going to church all of that much, it
[1:17:36] didn't save me. My dad believed what
[1:17:40] brother Brown said, you be their Holy
[1:17:41] Ghost until they get it for themselves.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; He believed it with all of his heart.
[1:17:48] Oh, I walk to an altar a time or two and
[1:17:52] and just just because others kind of
[1:17:55] pull me there
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; because I was supposed to
[1:18:01] and I began to get led under the
[1:18:03] influence of friends the wrong direction
[1:18:07] even within the church it be kind of to
[1:18:10] lead lead me they were whirly and and
[1:18:14] for some reason because I didn't have
[1:18:16] the new earth began to lead me in the
[1:18:17] wrong direction. And I could say from
[1:18:20] that time
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; from that time it went from maybe
[1:18:25] leaving service and going out while the
[1:18:27] service was going on and and then
[1:18:29] getting back in time to play music.
[1:18:33] I'm sorry. Maybe smoking a joint while I
[1:18:36] was out and then getting back.
[1:18:39] It wasn't long until I was a drug
[1:18:41] addict. It wasn't long till I was doing
[1:18:43] the wrong thing.
[1:18:45] But I knew no matter how far in sin I
[1:18:48] went, I knew
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; I knew there was something real.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Friend took me to a Baptist church and I
[1:19:02] said and I listened and he was a tall
[1:19:05] man and he he looked down at me. He
[1:19:07] said, "Ron, don't you want to go to the
[1:19:09] altar?" Incredible speaker. I said, "No,
[1:19:12] no, I don't want to go to the altar. Not
[1:19:14] here.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Not here.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; This ain't the spot.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Another friend took me to a Pentecostal
[1:19:23] church. You need this run. He tricked me
[1:19:25] and I went I heard a friend of mine
[1:19:28] preach and he stood and he preached. His
[1:19:30] name was Mike and he stood and he
[1:19:32] preached. He came down the aisle and he
[1:19:34] he literally got in front of me. Don't
[1:19:36] you want to come to the altar? No.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:19:42] because I knew where there was something
[1:19:44] real.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; I was now past 21 years old,
[1:20:00] just about coming on 22.
[1:20:03] And I told my grandma, who was quite a
[1:20:05] curser, she can make a Navy Seal,
[1:20:10] blush.
[1:20:13] Stood all 5 foot tall, weighed about 240
[1:20:17] lbs, got every bit of my height height
[1:20:20] from her.
[1:20:23] And I'll never forget, we were sitting
[1:20:24] at the table one night and it was it was
[1:20:26] it was a Saturday evening and she said,
[1:20:29] "They invited us to church." I said,
[1:20:31] "You need to go." She said, "You need to
[1:20:32] go with me."
[1:20:35] And we went
[1:20:38] and the man got up and he began to
[1:20:40] speak.
[1:20:42] And that presence that I had been
[1:20:43] running from.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; That presence I'd been running from now
[1:20:49] met me.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; And as I sat there, I couldn't pay
[1:20:55] attention to the words the mans were
[1:20:57] saying because there was a presence in
[1:20:59] the room now.
[1:21:02] And now I knew I knew without a shadow
[1:21:05] of a doubt. Now this is more than a man
[1:21:07] that's speaking to my heart.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; But this is God. And I'm very much aware
[1:21:14] that God anoints men.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; He will change their thoughts.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; He will literally change the entire
[1:21:21] meeting.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Waiting on that predestinated seat.
[1:21:28] Hallelujah.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, in my altar experience and in
[1:21:35] the experiences upcoming, I went to that
[1:21:38] altar and I said, "Lord, let me get
[1:21:41] something real from you.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; I need something more than churchity.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; I need more than just running through an
[1:21:50] an experience. I need you to live in my
[1:21:54] life.
[1:21:57] I'm going to be very honest with you
[1:21:58] tonight. I told him very vividly.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I told him, "I cannot do this."
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; In my human ability.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know who I'm speaking to, but
[1:22:14] I'm speaking to you. I could not do this
[1:22:16] in my human ability.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; And neither can you.
[1:22:26] and he came.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; If we're not careful, we'll get an easy
[1:22:35] belieism.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; We'll try to make a we'll we'll try to
[1:22:39] make an easier way for our children.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Just come and sit on a pew.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Just be good Christians.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Just marry a good wife. Just reflect
[1:22:50] Christ. If we're not careful, we'll get
[1:22:52] we'll start memorizing the message and
[1:22:55] memorizing quotes and memorizing
[1:22:57] scriptures and become good pew sitters.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; But let me remind you, the devil can do
[1:23:04] all of that.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; But there's one thing he cannot have,
[1:23:08] and that's a new birth.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Peter stood there that day.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Peter knew what we're talking about
[1:23:16] tonight.
[1:23:18] Simon Peter had believed the Christ and
[1:23:20] said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of
[1:23:23] the living God." And Jesus said, "Flesh
[1:23:26] and blood has not revealed this unto
[1:23:28] you, but my father which is in heaven."
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; But yet Peter in just hours would
[1:23:34] literally
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; rebuke the Lord
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; for saying he was getting ready to be
[1:23:40] crucified.
[1:23:47] Jesus would tell him, "Simon, I prayed
[1:23:50] for you."
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; When thou art converted, strengthened
[1:23:57] the brethren.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; So he was more than polished up.
[1:24:04] He was more than just religious.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; This was more than just emotion that he
[1:24:10] needed.
[1:24:12] His
[1:24:14] name had been changed,
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; but the life hadn't arrived yet.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron,
[1:24:24] I don't want emotion." Well, anything
[1:24:26] without emotion's dead.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Emotion just comes with it.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Passion just comes with it.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Life just comes with it.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:24:40] We need more than a social gospel.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; This little woman needed more than a
[1:24:46] social gospel.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; She needed more than just a just an
[1:24:50] identity change from being a harlot to a
[1:24:53] churchgoer.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; The Pharisees, their churches hadn't
[1:24:59] changed their life.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; But there was something about this man.
[1:25:05] If I can only get to him. Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; She ran home and she brother said she
[1:25:13] went up into her closet.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Went back into the back of the closet
[1:25:17] and there was a shock there with all the
[1:25:20] money that she had.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Listen, God's not looking for your fifth
[1:25:25] and sixth best. He wants everything that
[1:25:27] we've got.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; I'll serve him when it's convenient.
[1:25:32] God's not looking for a convenience.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; He wants our whole life.
[1:25:40] This woman begins to make her way
[1:25:41] towards a store. It's a store she's been
[1:25:44] at many times.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; And she's looking for more than an
[1:25:47] attractive scent. She wants the best.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; She wants the best that this man has.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; She throws her money out on the counter
[1:25:59] and he begins to count it and ask ask
[1:26:02] why why she's wanting it. And she begins
[1:26:05] to tell him her purpose. Why are you
[1:26:07] wasting your money? Brother Bram said,
[1:26:10] he said, the man begins to argue with
[1:26:12] her. She says, listen, just give me the
[1:26:15] best that you've got.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what your critics say
[1:26:19] about you.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't need to go to
[1:26:23] church that much.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Why did you quit listening to that kind
[1:26:26] of a music? Why did you go quit low to
[1:26:29] that kind of entertainment? Why did you
[1:26:31] leave all your friends aside?
[1:26:34] Brother Ron, I'm afraid my I'm afraid.
[1:26:36] I'm afraid of my friends. I'm afraid to
[1:26:38] leave my friends. Don't you worry about
[1:26:40] your friends. Your friends will leave
[1:26:42] you.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; And you'll get some real friends.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You'll get the kind of friends that'll
[1:26:51] be that'll be a kind of friend that will
[1:26:53] be with you through thick and thin.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. On good days, bad days.
[1:27:03] She begins to make her way.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; And listen, she has purpose in her mind.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe like some of you when you came to
[1:27:11] this meeting with great expectation.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know what this meeting will be
[1:27:16] like, but whatever it's like, I'm going
[1:27:20] to go to where he's at.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; She knew that she wasn't welcome.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; She knew that she hadn't got an
[1:27:28] invitation. Right.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; But there was somebody that was sitting
[1:27:32] at the room that needed her attention.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; She made her way. No doubt she had to
[1:27:41] sneak her way
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; past men that would have turned her
[1:27:44] around
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; because no way would she been welcome at
[1:27:49] this place.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; She makes her way to where he's at.
[1:27:57] Yes, sir.
[1:28:01] And brother Brandham said she be to wash
[1:28:05] his feet
[1:28:08] with her tears.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; I want you to just think about this just
[1:28:14] for a few moments.
[1:28:16] Here's the Messiah.
[1:28:19] Here's the lamb of God.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Here's a woman predestinated
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; of all of the men and women since Adam.
[1:28:28] Here is the woman that's predestinated
[1:28:30] to wash his feet.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Of all of all of the incredible human
[1:28:39] beings
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; that would come since Adam,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; here is the woman. Listen, because God
[1:28:49] in his mind knows who's going to be
[1:28:51] where, who's going to be born where in
[1:28:53] his pre-planning,
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; he knows your nature. Listen, he knows
[1:28:58] everything that's about you. Listen, he
[1:29:01] predestinates this woman.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; He puts this burden on her heart.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Let me just use a term. He bypasses a
[1:29:13] million,
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; 10 million, a 100 million. to use her to
[1:29:19] wash the Messiah's feet.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; her sins has brought her to this spot.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And here is the lamb of God that can
[1:29:37] take away the sins not only of her
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; but of the whole world.
[1:29:46] Hallelujah.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; To her, this is more than an event.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Listen, she had no way of knowing will
[1:29:58] he accept me or reject me.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; But she was willing.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; She was willing. Whatever.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy. No way was she worthy.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; She makes her way.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; She struggles to where he's at.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you've got to press your way
[1:30:19] to worship.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you've got to fight your way
[1:30:24] through every demon of hell.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Every demon of Leo.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; You got to fight your way through every
[1:30:31] dark spirit.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Even when you walk in church, you got to
[1:30:34] press your way to worship the Lord.
[1:30:38] You got to press your way past pride.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, you've been a
[1:30:44] Christian for years.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; You struggle to pray.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you struggle to read your read
[1:30:50] your Bible, struggle to listen to tapes,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; and that same enemy meets you in a
[1:30:56] service after service,
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; bombard your mind, bombard your worship,
[1:31:01] but your lips were made to praise the
[1:31:04] Lord.
[1:31:11] your voice.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not only is Brother
[1:31:15] Brandham's voice distinctive,
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; he has a distinctive voice.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; But not only his voice was distinctive,
[1:31:25] your pastor's voice was distinctive. My
[1:31:27] voice is distinctive. Each and every one
[1:31:30] of you has a distinctive voice,
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; but it was made in such a way.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; It was made in such a way until he could
[1:31:42] recognize our voice.
[1:31:48] Hallelujah.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Every man was built to worship God.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; He was built to worship God. He was
[1:31:55] built to come into his presence. There
[1:31:57] was a thirst that was placed in him
[1:32:00] since a baby to worship God.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And Satan tries to satisfy that thirst
[1:32:05] with the gods of the world, the gods of
[1:32:07] sports, the gods of humanity.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:13] But when we come into his presence,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, we want to give him
[1:32:18] everything.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; We're built to be in a three room house.
[1:32:31] He said,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; "Anybody can be in the kitchen. Anybody
[1:32:34] can be in the living room.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; But he wants his wife to come to the
[1:32:38] bedroom to become intimate with him. We
[1:32:41] want a relationship.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; We don't want to say this is just the
[1:32:48] best that we got. Take it or leave it.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; We want to give him our all.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; I can see Ruth when she makes her way.
[1:33:01] She's worked in the field. She's done
[1:33:03] all. Hallelujah. She's watched his
[1:33:05] movements. Now she's instructed by her
[1:33:08] mother-in-law. go lay at his feet.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; She knows the persecution's going to
[1:33:16] come. She knows they're going to say all
[1:33:18] matter of things about her, but she's
[1:33:20] pressed to predestinated to be the
[1:33:23] bride,
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; a type of the bride of this day. And
[1:33:28] she's willing to lay at the kinsman's
[1:33:32] feet.
[1:33:39] Hallelujah.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you willing to lay at
[1:33:43] his feet?
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; What a scene this is.
[1:33:57] You've heard it.
[1:33:59] You've heard these kinds of sermons over
[1:34:01] and over in your life, just as I did.
[1:34:08] But what if you had have been the person
[1:34:13] that was asked
[1:34:17] selected
[1:34:19] to be in his feet.
[1:34:25] She stays there.
[1:34:30] She brings him all
[1:34:32] her sorrow.
[1:34:35] all of her broken promises,
[1:34:39] all of her heartache,
[1:34:42] all of her complexes.
[1:34:44] She brings in all the strains of her own
[1:34:46] humanity.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; This is her opportunity.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Listen, opportunity doesn't happen every
[1:34:54] moment.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; The courier that brought the message
[1:34:58] missed his opportunity. Right.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; The rich young ruler, he missed his
[1:35:03] opportunity.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Elvis Presley missed his opportunity.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; The celebrities of hell missed their
[1:35:10] opportunity.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, there's been many of people that
[1:35:15] sat with us in churches
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; that missed their opportunity.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Blind Barameus said, he was standing by
[1:35:24] a rock wall. Brother man said, "A cool
[1:35:26] day,
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; sun beaming down on that that wall." He
[1:35:30] backed himself up against the wall and
[1:35:32] he was standing there like he stood many
[1:35:34] days.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Maybe he could remember the turtle doves
[1:35:38] that he's offered up and he could
[1:35:39] remember other things
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; and he hears a noise coming down the
[1:35:44] road
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; and people are worshiping and screaming
[1:35:47] and hollering and he hears testimony,
[1:35:50] maybe another testimony. I had this
[1:35:52] disease. I couldn't walk. I couldn't see
[1:35:56] and he touched me and I'm well.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And he can remember when he was a little
[1:36:02] boy sitting on his mama's lap and she's
[1:36:05] rehearsing to him about Elijah's God.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Jehovah
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; She goes through the attributes of God.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; There's one coming. Oh yeah.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; And he hears the testimonies coming by
[1:36:27] his way. And there's a noise. Re said
[1:36:30] wherever Jesus is always a lot of noise.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; This is his opportunity.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; We don't know how old he was, but now
[1:36:40] age is starting to pass him by. This is
[1:36:42] his opportunity.
[1:36:45] He didn't even know what to call him,
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; but he be to scream, "Thou son of David,
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; have mercy."
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. Whatever it takes to stop
[1:37:02] him in his tracks,
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; listen. Do whatever it takes in this
[1:37:07] building this week.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Do whatever it takes to get his
[1:37:12] attention.
[1:37:21] Brother Ron, why are you so passionate?
[1:37:23] I'll tell you why I'm passionate. This
[1:37:24] may be the last meeting.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Noah preached the last service.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Noah preached the last service.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't that Noah that's the one
[1:37:39] shut the door. God shut the door.
[1:37:42] Luther stepped into the pull pit and
[1:37:44] preached the last message. Are you with
[1:37:45] me? Wesley preached the last one.
[1:37:47] Brother Brown preached the last one. We
[1:37:49] don't know when it'll be our last one.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, but we've been coming to church for
[1:37:54] years, but it's soon coming to an end.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; This woman knew it was her opportunity
[1:38:01] to be at his feet.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; She had taken some wrong roads in life.
[1:38:06] She had walked down some wrong paths in
[1:38:08] life. She had made some wrong choices.
[1:38:10] Brother Ron, I've made some wrong
[1:38:12] choices. Nobody here is to beat you to
[1:38:14] with your choices.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; But listen, listen. Let God start
[1:38:18] changing the way you make your choices.
[1:38:33] Brother Brandham says she pours out the
[1:38:35] oint and it begins to fill the whole
[1:38:37] room.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; He has she has the whole the whole
[1:38:52] place's attention now.
[1:38:57] And now the man that's the head of the
[1:38:59] party,
[1:39:01] his name is Simon.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to this quotation.
[1:39:08] This man,
[1:39:10] if he were a prophet,
[1:39:15] would have known who and what manner of
[1:39:19] woman
[1:39:20] this is. Let me just say this to you.
[1:39:24] The reason that he was even in the room
[1:39:26] was for her.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; He wasn't there for Simon.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; He wasn't there for those religious men.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; They God had used them to invite him.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; To get her.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:53] The whole reason of why he was there was
[1:39:56] for her.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; What a thought.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; What an incredible thought. Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; All of this money, all of these
[1:40:09] celebrities, all of these Pharisees, all
[1:40:13] of the social light, all the meat that
[1:40:15] was cooked, all the wine that was drank,
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; all of the setup, all of the work behind
[1:40:23] the scenes was to get her there. And
[1:40:26] they didn't even know
[1:40:40] Oh, I feel like jumping to the top of
[1:40:42] this tent right now.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; He would have came to this earth and did
[1:40:48] it all if it was just for me.
[1:40:59] If he knew,
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; he more than just knew this
[1:41:03] predestinated moment was for her.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Listen how brother Brennham uses this.
[1:41:21] She was determined to get to Jesus.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the outside world
[1:41:25] says.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Let's get to Jesus.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; He is the main thing.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Listen to how he uses it. In fact, he
[1:41:36] says, I believe for the first time since
[1:41:38] Jesus had been at the feast, he felt at
[1:41:41] home.
[1:41:43] Jesus feels more at home with a
[1:41:45] repentant harlot
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; than he than he would
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; in your big fine classy church.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere we need.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; We're not here for the who's who.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; We're not here to how how fine we can
[1:42:07] be, how eloquent speakers that we can
[1:42:10] be.
[1:42:16] She's repentant.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; The tears are rolling down her cheeks
[1:42:20] and on his feet.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; She's washing his feet with the tears.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; She's kissing his feet.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Sure she did. She didn't care what
[1:42:30] anybody thought.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; She was in the presence of Jesus.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; What does she care about her actions?
[1:42:38] Her heart was pouring out. the fountains
[1:42:41] of repentance. What beautiful water for
[1:42:44] his feet.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; She was washing them.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; She was hysterical.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; The man said, "And I was too."
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; I was too. When I got in his presence, I
[1:42:58] got hysterical.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; I didn't care what anybody else thought.
[1:43:02] I know they said I was a holy ruler, but
[1:43:05] I don't care.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; I was before Jesus.
[1:43:10] I didn't care if they exccommunicated me
[1:43:12] from the church. I was in the presence
[1:43:14] of Jesus. As she was washing his feet,
[1:43:18] oh, I'd love to be there. Wouldn't you?
[1:43:20] And they were standing. The Pharisees
[1:43:22] nudged the other one. Said, "Now, if he
[1:43:24] was a prophet, he'd know that woman who
[1:43:27] she was." And he said, "It goes to show
[1:43:30] you that he don't know what he's talking
[1:43:32] about." He said, "She's kissing his
[1:43:35] feet. Kissing his feet cuz she's
[1:43:37] repenting. tears flowing down all of her
[1:43:40] hair. She had done gone all the top off
[1:43:42] of her head. She's her curls are all
[1:43:45] fell down around her. She stops and
[1:43:48] takes this out box
[1:43:50] out and she did that and she didn't
[1:43:53] break and she breaks it again. She pours
[1:43:56] the whole thing over him.
[1:43:59] all that she's got with the tears and
[1:44:02] the oil washing his feet and kissing the
[1:44:06] grease all over her mouth, her hair
[1:44:09] falling down. She picks up the curls.
[1:44:11] She sets his feet up and begins to wipe
[1:44:14] them with the hairs of her head.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Don't never let these stories become
[1:44:20] common.
[1:44:23] Oh God,
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; can you stay with me just a few more
[1:44:28] moments?
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; The celebrity was there. All the society
[1:44:32] of the city was there. She looked like
[1:44:35] she was out of her head. Maybe she was,
[1:44:37] but she was at the feet of Jesus. People
[1:44:40] may act crazy, but what difference does
[1:44:43] it make when you're at the feet of
[1:44:44] Jesus?
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; What do I care what they think?
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; She was at the feet of Jesus. She was
[1:44:51] kissing him.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; The old Pharisee. Oh my. He was ready to
[1:44:55] blow up.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus turns his eyes and looks
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; and I can see those eyes as he turns his
[1:45:02] sacred head.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; And he know the thoughts of that
[1:45:05] Pharisee. Simon, I've got something to
[1:45:08] talk to you about.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, you see Pharisee, one of these days
[1:45:13] to come to you. I've got something to
[1:45:15] talk to you about. You invited me here.
[1:45:17] You never give me any water for my feet.
[1:45:21] You never anointed my head with when I
[1:45:23] came in. Neither did you kiss me.
[1:45:25] Welcome.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; But the poor sinner ever since I've been
[1:45:30] sitting here. She's done nothing but
[1:45:32] wash my feet with her tears. Wipe them
[1:45:35] with the hairs of her head. Kiss my feet
[1:45:38] ever since I've been here. Amen.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a judgment day it'll be
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; when he looks at preacher after preacher
[1:45:52] and says, "You didn't welcome me at your
[1:45:54] church.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Singer after singer,
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; you're talent and you didn't welcome me.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:09] Know it alls. He said, "Mine's so full
[1:46:12] of stuff and no place for Jesus."
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Oh, Pharisee.
[1:46:21] He says, "No." He looked over. Now the
[1:46:24] woman's scared.
[1:46:26] What's he going to say?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Is he going to condemn her?
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz his words is the words that matter.
[1:46:38] It doesn't matter what they say.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; I could care less what Obama says.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; I could care less what the dignitaries
[1:46:48] of the city says.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; It's what he says.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; It's what he says.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; He's the one that makes a difference.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; He's the important one in this building
[1:47:03] tonight.
[1:47:06] I'll tell you the important one here is
[1:47:07] tonight. It's him.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Don't you never get your eyes on a man.
[1:47:13] You keep your eyes on him.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I'm not the one that
[1:47:20] you're feeding on. You're feeding on
[1:47:22] more than the mind of a man. You're
[1:47:25] feeding on the body word of the Son of
[1:47:27] Man.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; I want him to be a trapper.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Is he going to condemn her? Let me just
[1:47:41] say, did he jerk his foot back and say,
[1:47:45] "Don't do that." No.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus don't do things like that.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; He never pulled his foot back. No, sir.
[1:47:55] He sat right there and watched her.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:03] She was doing for him
[1:48:06] what they ought to have done.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; She was doing for him what they ought to
[1:48:14] have done.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; There was the Pharisee, the bishop of
[1:48:19] the church with all the pastors and
[1:48:22] elders standing around thought
[1:48:23] themselves too good to touch this holy
[1:48:26] roller. Right.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; This poor little woman standing there
[1:48:30] now.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; She is going to receive.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; She knowed that she loved him.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. The greatest
[1:48:44] thing you can ever do is fall in love
[1:48:46] with him.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; When you fall in love with him,
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. There is nothing in this world
[1:48:56] matters
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; when you fall in love with him. Are you
[1:49:01] with me now?
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; When you fall in love with him, listen,
[1:49:05] it just gets better.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Every service, every day, every
[1:49:10] scripture, every tape,
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; every prayer meeting, no matter how bad
[1:49:17] your trials are, no matter how dark your
[1:49:20] valleys are.
[1:49:23] Hallelujah.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a love affair.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; You don't have to make yourself go to
[1:49:38] church anymore.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have to make yourself pray
[1:49:42] anymore.
[1:49:49] Had she done something wrong?
[1:49:54] He said one day whosoever will let him
[1:49:56] come and they wouldn't and she wanted
[1:50:00] to.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; If these big starchy churches won't
[1:50:04] worship God, God will put out you poor
[1:50:08] people and he'll let you do it.
[1:50:11] He will call the sinners and the harlots
[1:50:14] from the streets to do it.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Somebody is going to worship God.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Then look at that little woman. She's
[1:50:32] startled. Her big brown eyes as
[1:50:35] beautiful as they was. Looked up. Then
[1:50:38] he turns after looking at the Pharisees.
[1:50:41] Grease all over her face and her tears
[1:50:44] washed down her face. Her hair hanging
[1:50:46] in streaks. There she was. What's he
[1:50:48] going to do? What's he going to do?
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Simon, I come at your invitation. You
[1:50:54] invited me. You never washed my feet.
[1:50:57] You g You never anointed my oil all on
[1:51:00] my hands and my neck. You never kissed
[1:51:02] me. Welcome. But this poor sinner has
[1:51:05] constantly kissed my feet.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Who would love the most? He begins to
[1:51:15] say
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; and he gives him a parable.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said in his embarrassment,
[1:51:27] he stood there redfaced
[1:51:30] knowing he was trapped.
[1:51:35] And now the woman
[1:51:38] that has been at the feet that they've
[1:51:40] made fun of, now she becomes their envy.
[1:51:51] Though her sins be many,
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; though her sins be many,
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; g
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; she is forgiven.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Only the lamb can do that.
[1:52:13] Only the lamb
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; can do that.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Many sacrifices and preached has been in
[1:52:21] order but only the lamb.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Very shout an unwelcome Christ.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; But the lamb of God
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; pronounces out of his lips
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; though your sins be many.
[1:52:42] You are forgiven.
[1:52:59] Hallelujah.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Just a couple more minutes.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Forgiven. Brother Brandham said, he said
[1:53:05] it's more than just being justified. He
[1:53:08] said justified is as though you never
[1:53:10] did it in the first place. It wasn't
[1:53:12] even the real you.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, I was this and I
[1:53:18] was that and I wasn't. Come to a
[1:53:19] revelation. It wasn't you.
[1:53:25] That was your father's and mother's DNA
[1:53:27] poured down in you.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You was named a sinner.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; But now you're an overcomer.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, but you was you was no sir.
[1:53:51] When God justified me,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; he predestinated me. Romans chapter 8,
[1:53:57] he predestinated me before the
[1:53:59] foundation of the world.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; And God, who is rich in mercy,
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; never saw me as a drug addict,
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; never saw me in my sin, never saw me in
[1:54:12] my father's iniquities, never saw me in
[1:54:15] any of my mistakes.
[1:54:18] But God who is rich in mercy took my
[1:54:21] deed that had a whole lot of accusation
[1:54:24] against it and he washed it with his
[1:54:26] blood.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; He became my kinsman redeemer.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; He became worthy
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; and he bought he paid for the whole
[1:54:41] thing.
[1:54:44] Hallelujah.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; It's done.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Things that you've been wrestling with
[1:54:56] for months, weeks, and years.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; If you could lay it at his feet tonight,
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; and you could wash his feet with tears,
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; you've already got your his attention
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; just to get you here.
[1:55:16] Amen.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, if I could only get his
[1:55:18] attention just to get you here.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; He knew you were coming.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; He waited on you to take your place.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; He knew what seat you would be in
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; when they were lining up your seats. He
[1:55:36] knew where you would sit here tonight.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; And he would know that he would come to
[1:55:41] that seat.
[1:55:42] He would deal with your heart.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He would come to where
[1:55:46] you're at.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; To tell you, you don't have to live that
[1:55:53] way no more.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; This is more than sitting in a pew. It's
[1:55:58] more than just believing it. Cast all
[1:56:00] your cares on me.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; I care. I care for you.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Every head bowed in this place just now.
[1:56:11] Hallelujah.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; She found the fountain of purity.
[1:56:44] things that you've wrestled with in your
[1:56:46] mind,
[1:56:47] things that you've tried in your natural
[1:56:49] being to try to overcome.
[1:56:53] You know you like nobody else knows you
[1:56:59] and you'll go so high and then the enemy
[1:57:02] will knock you right back down cuz he
[1:57:04] knows your weaknesses.
[1:57:06] He'll allow you to enjoy service only to
[1:57:09] remind you of where you really living.
[1:57:14] Why don't you let the keys on the chains
[1:57:16] that are holding you?
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Why don't you let the Lord take those
[1:57:19] chains off your life?
[1:57:23] Let him take those dark shadows of your
[1:57:25] life, those dark complexes and
[1:57:28] depression of your life tonight. Won't
[1:57:30] you give it to him and say on the first
[1:57:33] night of this meeting, there's no need
[1:57:34] to wait till Sunday. On the first night
[1:57:36] of this meeting,
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; I'd like to spend just a little bit of
[1:57:40] time with him.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Would you be a hand up tonight? Say,
[1:57:45] "Brother Ron, I need him. I need him. I
[1:57:49] need him. I need him."
[1:57:52] Hallelujah. I need him. We're not here
[1:57:56] for show. We're not here for even
[1:58:01] one another right now.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; We're here for him.
[1:58:05] Hallelujah. You'll have to stand alone
[1:58:07] when you go home.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; You'll have to stand alone somewhere.
[1:58:10] Now,
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; tonight, I want you to spend some time
[1:58:13] alone in the sanctuary of your heart.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; As the musicians would come, I want to
[1:58:20] invite you every hand.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; I want to invite you to come now
[1:58:26] to spend some time with him at this
[1:58:28] altar.
[1:58:31] I want to invite you to step out from
[1:58:33] where you're at just now.
[1:58:36] I want you to come.
[1:58:40] I don't know what your condition is,
[1:58:43] but he's created this meeting to speak
[1:58:46] to your heart.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Young, old,
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; you know who you are.
[1:59:00] You've been wanting a revival
[1:59:02] and he's the revival.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; You've allowed things to cool off.
[1:59:07] You've allowed things to get in your
[1:59:08] life. You've allowed some things to
[1:59:10] happen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Tonight's the opportunity to lay it at
[1:59:14] his feet for a little while.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; We're not here to question why or what.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; It's your turn.
[1:59:30] It's your turn just now,
[1:59:35] Lord Jesus.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; For such a time as this.
[1:59:55] Lord to
[1:59:58] need you.
[2:00:05] No matter how long she lived,
[2:00:08] she had a personal testimony.
[2:00:14] There was a day like no other day.
[2:00:19] And I'm sure she told that testimony a
[2:00:22] thousand times.
[2:00:24] Oh Jesus,
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; there's none like you.
[2:00:36] None like you.
[2:00:40] I too had heard sermon after sermon
[2:00:42] after sermon after sermon after sermon
[2:00:44] and went to church for years.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Raised in an incredible home.
[2:00:52] Boy, I finally met you.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; I didn't need psychology no more.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; I found the one that I really needed.
[2:01:19] All my wasted days,
[2:01:24] my failed opportunities.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, I couldn't rewrite yesterday or
[2:01:32] the day before.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; But I could determine, God, I'm going to
[2:01:38] put you first the rest of my life.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, there's people sitting here
[2:01:44] tonight, Father,
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; that's even wrestling in this service.
[2:01:50] Satan's doing his best to get them
[2:01:52] through it and trying to keep them out
[2:01:54] of your presence.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you bring a victory in their
[2:02:01] lives.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; May you bring a victory tonight, Father.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; May you release the chains of sin and
[2:02:10] darkness.
[2:02:12] May every demon be bound tonight in the
[2:02:14] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:02:17] May the angels wings be felt sweeping
[2:02:19] through this building. Father, may your
[2:02:22] August presence just sweep down into our
[2:02:24] lives.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:02:29] may the voice behind the voice,
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; speak to the deep down in our heart, the
[2:02:35] thirst and the desire,
[2:02:38] Lord, the longing,
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; that which lacking. Tonight I pray,
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Lord, may there come a peace in our life
[2:02:46] that passes all understanding, a peace
[2:02:49] we can't get from education, a peace we
[2:02:51] can't get from the world.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you would come and
[2:02:56] live in our lives.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, you hear our voices calling out to
[2:03:00] you just now. Come meet us at our altar.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Come meet us at our pew just now.

[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; May we never be the same ever again.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Oh God, maybe we've let things sit
[2:03:24] between us and God. We've become cool.
[2:03:28] We've allowed our prayer life to slip
[2:03:30] away.
[2:03:31] We've allowed the emotional Lord God of
[2:03:34] the world and things to steal our joy,
[2:03:38] rob us of our victory.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask you to restore it tonight,
[2:03:41] dear Lord.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Restore it tonight.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, come to us just now, Father.

[2:03:53] in Jesus Christ.

[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; As a pastor was opening up Messiah
[2:20:00] again.
[2:20:03] The veil is so thin.
[2:20:07] We think we see a man, but I see God. I
[2:20:11] see the word. So, was that brother Ron
[2:20:14] Spencer ministering to us or was that
[2:20:16] the word himself? You must determine in
[2:20:19] your heart that was the word that spoke
[2:20:21] to me.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; It wasn't some emotion that spoke. That
[2:20:24] was the word of God.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; And that word is what met my soul. And
[2:20:29] that's why I was moved not by a
[2:20:32] minister, but I've been moved by the
[2:20:34] word of God.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Anchor that deep in your heart tonight.
[2:20:40] Continue in worship. Continue in praise.
[2:20:45] Continue in this atmosphere. Take it
[2:20:47] with you when you leave the tent.
[2:20:51] We want God to go to the cabins.
[2:20:55] We want the Holy Spirit. We want, as we
[2:20:57] had at winter camp, prayer meetings in
[2:20:59] our cabins speaking of what God's done
[2:21:02] individually within our lives.
[2:21:06] We want to thank all those that have
[2:21:08] come to visit and to be with us come
[2:21:11] many miles. We want to thank you.
[2:21:15] God's God
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; and we don't want to limit the Holy
[2:21:18] Spirit.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; So, we pray that God will go with you as
[2:21:22] you make your way off the grounds.
[2:21:26] We've opened the camp. It's a family
[2:21:28] camp. We have a full camp.
[2:21:31] And so with a full camp comes full
[2:21:33] responsibilities.
[2:21:35] And we hate to limit it, but once the
[2:21:38] service is over, if you wouldn't mind
[2:21:39] just making your way and make your way
[2:21:41] off the grounds. And if God should bring
[2:21:43] you back tomorrow night and bring your
[2:21:45] lick of fire, that's wonderful.
[2:21:48] Just mind the Holy Spirit. Mind God. And
[2:21:52] we thank you once again for being a part
[2:21:55] of what God is doing
[2:21:58] here at this camp.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God's not finished. This is
[2:22:02] just the beginning, young people.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[2:22:18] Father, a song goes, I just want to
[2:22:20] thank you, Lord,
[2:22:22] for letting me hear your word. Yes,
[2:22:24] Lord.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. That means so much to me, Lord,
[2:22:28] when men and women are are dull of
[2:22:30] hearing today. But so, Lord, there's a
[2:22:33] receiving set within our soul and said,
[2:22:36] "That's the word. That's the word. Lord,
[2:22:38] there's something in us that wants to
[2:22:40] respond." Amen. Amen. Amen. Lord God,
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; we're thankful that we heard the word
[2:22:46] tonight. And God, these young people had
[2:22:48] a receiver set. They just said, "Oh,
[2:22:51] God, you see my need. you see my burden
[2:22:54] and they've come and we pray God that
[2:22:57] you'll do greater things within their
[2:22:59] lives.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; We're thankful for the Holy Spirit and
[2:23:02] it's moving in their hearts tonight. We
[2:23:05] pray that you'll continue not only this
[2:23:07] evening but tomorrow morning when
[2:23:09] brother Tim Do will speak and tomorrow
[2:23:11] night. Lord, we just want to say here I
[2:23:13] am
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; without one plea.
[2:23:17] Lord, open our hearts in a greater way
[2:23:20] to see the greater manifestation of the
[2:23:23] word of God today. Lord,
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; God, would you strengthen Brother
[2:23:28] Spencer?
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Thankful for his ministry. We pray, God,
[2:23:32] that you will use him in a mighty way in
[2:23:35] in the nights that lay ahead. And God,
[2:23:37] would you be his portion tonight? Would
[2:23:39] the angel of the Lord come into that
[2:23:41] little room and touch that man of God
[2:23:43] and strengthen him, Lord? that tomorrow
[2:23:46] night he'll come with a fire in his
[2:23:48] bones.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; strengthen him and
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; thankful for him.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Now, as we go our way,
[2:24:01] Lord, would you go with those that'll go
[2:24:04] on the road, watch over them, and Lord,
[2:24:06] again, we we remember our brother Jim
[2:24:08] Weber, Lord, and this accident. Lord, we
[2:24:11] just pray that you will strengthen him
[2:24:13] tonight, Lord. God, let there be a peace
[2:24:15] that reigns within his heart. That there
[2:24:17] is a God that's watched over him.
[2:24:20] There's a people that's praying for him.
[2:24:23] Lord, we're just so thankful for Sister
[2:24:25] Lisa. We pray God that you also will be
[2:24:27] her peace, her portion tonight. Lord, in
[2:24:30] the children, we just pray God that you
[2:24:32] will be their comfort. That they can
[2:24:34] rejoice that there was a God that
[2:24:36] watched over daddy.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Now, Father, we're thankful for this
[2:24:41] word. We heard what you're doing. Go
[2:24:45] with your children now. We pray
[2:24:48] in Jesus name. Watch over us all. We
[2:24:51] thank you. Amen.
[2:24:56] Amen. God bless you all. Thank you for
[2:24:58] coming. Campers, you can linger as long
[2:25:01] as you wish.
[2:25:03] God be with you. He has forgiven me.
[2:25:09] He
[2:25:14] for
[2:25:18] me
[2:25:20] my sins
[2:25:25] from his
[2:25:31] blood
[2:25:36] of heaven. Cal
[2:25:46] for
[2:25:49] me.
[2:25:52] Oh, he
[2:25:55] has
[2:25:57] forgive
[2:26:00] me.
[2:26:02] My sins have been washed
[2:26:07] from his family
[2:26:12] by the blood
[2:26:14] of the lamb
[2:26:18] of
[2:26:24] heaven.
[2:26:39] for
[2:26:42] me.
[2:26:44] My sins
[2:26:46] have been
[2:26:49] from his
[2:26:54] by the blood
[2:26:56] of the lamb
[2:27:00] of God.
