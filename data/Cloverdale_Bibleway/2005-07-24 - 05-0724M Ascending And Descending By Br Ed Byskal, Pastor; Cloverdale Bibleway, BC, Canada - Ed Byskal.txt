TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. There are a lot of people gathering around the world this morning and have gathered for the purpose of worshiping God.

Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to your name, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Ask brother Roy Florent. Brother Roy, if you'd come, open the service in a word of prayer. We've got uh some needs that we want to remember this morning, and I know there are many here, I'm sure, who have needs that they want to be remembered. Um, we got a testimony from uh David Iverson. Remember that his wife had a very serious uh stomach infection, was taken to the hospital just after they arrived here. And um since the saints prayed on Sunday night, she sat up in bed and now she is completely healed. Thank the Lord for his healing power and the saints for their prayers. Amen. Testimony from our sister sacred said, "We'd like to thank and glorify our Lord for being faithful and true. remember we uh including my that uh we prayed for uh sister Cigarett's sister Margot because on June 30th they learned that uh she was diagnosed with cancer and that had already uh metastasized in her body and they just want to thank the congregation for their prayers and support. On July the 3rd the congregation prayed for her complete healing and salvation. The week of July 4th, my sister went through extensive specialized cancer testing to locate the source of the cancer. All the tests returned negative. Says with the exception of the Amen. Praise God. It said with the exception of the blood count test which remains high, the doctors are perplexed because they can't find any cancer. My sister believes the Lord has healed her. She appears tender toward the Lord. Just wants to give praise and thanks. And we want to continue to pray for her salvation. Amen. And uh Brother Frank Fletcher is requesting prayer for his neighbor who was taken to the Langley Hospital with an unknown sickness. His name is Dick Page. He's requesting that we pray for his recovery and especially for his salvation. Want to thank everyone for their prayers for my dad. He just continues to grow weak. But you know, we were over there last night. He wasn't in any pain. He said he was uh yesterday he said or I guess it was yet uh on Friday. He said uh heard a the doorbell ring and uh someone door open and he said it was like he had a vision and uh he said it was a very large man. He said he just said I've come to take Len home. and uh he said, "I've seen the man before. He's my angel." So, we're just uh thankful for those little things and dad's not in any pain. So, we're just thankful for that and uh continue to appreciate your prayers. Uh if you've got a need this morning and would like to have it remembered before the Lord, you just lift your hand. If you're listening in on the internet, and I know we have many people are listening on the internet, you just if you've got a request, you just take it before the Lord now as we come before brother Roy. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Our loving heavenly father, we thank you once again for another opportunity to be gathered here this morning in the house of God to worship the true and living God this morning. Already, Father, we've felt your presence here this morning, oh God. And we want to welcome your spirit, Lord. We want to give you all the praise and all the glory that you truly deserve. For you're a God. You're a mighty God who dwells in the praises of your people this morning, Father. Oh loving heavenly father, where would we be without you in our lives, Lord? Where would our lives be without the presence of God and without this message, this word which you have sent us from your eternal glory, Father. So this morning, we've come to return praise with our lives, oh God. Not just in an appearance this morning, but we've come to make love to you this morning. We've come to give you our life, Father. We come to exalt you. We come to worship you. We come to praise you, Father. For there's no one who is truly as worthy. There's no one who's truly as deserving. Lord, to whom can we lift up our voice this morning, Father, who can hear us when we pray but thee alone. For this morning, Father, you have come, oh Lord, to hear and to be in our presence this morning. So we want to thank you, Father. We want to thank you with all of our hearts this morning. We want to thank you, Lord, for all the goodness and mercy that you've showed to us throughout the years. We want to thank you for the mercy you showed yesterday. Lord, we want to thank you for the mercy that you've showed today, Father. We want to thank you for the mercy that you've sent before the foundation of the world, oh God, that we would be chosen to be your children in this end time. Oh God, we bring this request of brother Frank Fletcher before you for his neighbor. We ask that oh God that you will reach down into this man's life, oh God, and that you would touch not just his body, but you would touch his soul this morning. For the body will perish, but the soul is worth 10,000 words to you, Lord. Touch him and raise him up for thy glory and thy honor. We pray, Lord. We thank you for the for the testimonies, Lord, that has come and how you've answered prayer, Father, for Brother Iverson's wife, Father. We just want to give you praise. We just want to give you glory, Father, for you're a mighty God of healing, Lord. You've healed her, and we want to thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord, we thank you for Sister Cigarett's testimony on behalf of her sister. Lord, not even cancer can stand in the presence of the prayer of the bride this morning. &gt;&gt; There's no demons that can stand in the presence of the children of God. &gt;&gt; So we thank you this morning, oh God, for that mighty testimony, Lord. And we pray, oh God, as you've healed her body, you'll heal her soul, Lord, and bring her to the perfect knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Father, this morning I do have a prayer request on behalf of my boss. Oh God. Lord, you know I've lived a life and a testimony before him. And this morning, oh God, he is in the balance and he is wanting. I pray almighty God that you will reach down in this hospital bed right now and touch Gary. Father, raise him up, oh God, for your glory. the Lord that he will testify with his own lips that God has raised him up, Father, and we'll have an entrance to witness to his soul, Father, and you shall receive the glory and the honor. We pray, Father. So, we claim his healing this morning, Father. We pray anything that is out of order will be put back in order. And that, oh God, the doctors will be confounded. that oh God our God is alive and he's still healing people in this time. Lord, Father, we pray for brother Rod's dad even once again. Lord, we thank you for the man of God, oh Father, who have leave a true testimony before his children. We pray for the peace that you've given him. We thank you for the rest that you've given him, Father. And we ask that, Lord, you will just give him peace as he's laying waiting on you, Father. We just ask that Lord you would just bless the family. We thank you oh God for brother Rod and his life and his testimony. Give his father peace we pray this morning. And we ask oh God your blessing on this congregation this morning. Not just here oh God but those who are hooked up with us around the world. We ask that oh God that this service will be a blessing to each one this morning. We pray that every need will be met in your divine presence this morning. Father, whether it be healing to the soul, healing to the body, Lord, whatever difficulty that your children are in this morning, you are God, Father, and in you is the blessing that we need this morning. And we claim it in the name of Jesus Christ for each one. And oh God, as the man of God would, we stand behind this sacred desk. Father, we have not come here to hear a man, but we've come here to hear Jesus Christ. And we know that, oh God, you will give him the uncction this morning. That our pastor will be able to pull himself out of the way, Father. And oh God, the gift that you've installed in him for the edification and the perfecting of the bride will come forth in a powerful demonstration this morning, Lord. Bless him and give him strength. We pray, Father. Oh God, may the anointing come down upon him in a mighty way this morning, Lord, that the word of God will find its bedding ground in each good heart this morning. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask this thanks. Amen and amen. Amen. You may be seated. want to welcome everyone this morning and we're real happy to have each and every one of you here.

So, we're going to have Thursday service that week, no Wednesday service, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday morning, no service Sunday night. So, uh any questions? Um talk to one of the brothers. Uh but I think that should answer most question uh most questions as well. All right. [Music] Do you know how it feels to know something's missing and hear a still small voice that you just keep dismissing? Do you know how it feels to be troubled inside? To think just for you on a cross someone died. Do you know how it feels when he knocks to surrender? Have your sins washed away. Never to be remembered and know that it's real. Tell me, do you know how it feels? How does it feel to know you're a child of the king? Your heavenly father owns everything. How does it feel to know you are loved by the one who created the stars up above? How does it feel to know you're all right when you lay your head on your pillow each night and know that it's real? Tell me, do you know how it feels? &gt;&gt; Do you know how it feels when your cold heart has melted and tears started flowing the moment you felt him? Do you know how it feels to know you've been changed? And it seems that the whole world has been rearranged. &gt;&gt; Do you know how it feels? Wherever you wrong, you still get that feeling. You're not at home knowing heaven is real. Tell me, do you know how it feels? How does it feel to know you're a child of the king? Your heavenly father owns everything. How does it feel to know you are loved by the one who created the stars up above? How does it feel to know you're all right when you lay your head on your pillow each night and know that it's real? Tell me, do you know how it feels? How does it feel to know you're a child of the king? Your heavenly father owns everything. How does it feel to know you are loved by the one who created the stars up above? How does it feel to know you're all right when you lay your head on your pillow each night and know that it's real? Tell me, do you know how it feels? And you know that it's real. Tell me, do you know how it feels? [Music] [Applause] Praise God. Song is going through my mind this morning. I just want to take a little bit of time to shout glory, glory, glory. Why don't we sing that? We're going to turn the service to brother Ed. Now, do you know how it feels? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Why don't we stand together? Let's start with the first verse. Well, the whole world's broken in darkness, but he gave us light to see. The whole world's broken in darkness, but he gave us light to see. Well, the whole world's broken in darkness, but he gave us light to see. Imagine how he loves you and me. Amen. I just want to take a little bit of time to shout glory. Glory. Glory. Lord. I just want to take a little bit of time to shout glory. Oh Lord. I just want to take a little bit of time. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory [Music] to the station for home. God get ready to leave. Oh, morning for home. God get ready to leave. Praise the creation of God. Get ready to leave the whistle always. I just want to take time for it. Oh Lord, I just want to take a little bit of time. Glory, glory, glory, Lord. I just want to say time. Glory, glory, glory. Glory, glory, glory. You just want to take a little bit of time. You got the glory. Glory. Oh, I just want to take a little bit of time. You got the glory, glory, glory. Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory to [Music] &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're here to praise him. &gt;&gt; While we have breath, let's give him all the praise and the honor. He's worthy. Is there anyone else that's worthy? No. He's the only worthy one. &gt;&gt; Amen. So glad to have you here this morning and all that are joined with us on the internet. We just want to say God bless them. God bless us all together. Amen. Uh Brother Rod made some announcements and I have a couple more that I just will make while you're still standing. Uh the the junior camp is going in on the August the 7th. So, we're having that one service Sunday, August the 7th, and the junior camp commences that day. And then, as as has been announced, Brother Ron Spencer will be our camp speaker and be speaking four services, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. You know, I think that it's more than us just getting up and making an announcement and all the preparation brother Spencer has taken. He's taken a week this next week. He's taken the whole week just to prepare himself and become uh physically. He wants to be alert and physically strong. And a a minister puts a lot into a meeting. A lot into a meeting. And uh sometimes we ponder subjects for a long time, then we study them and wait on God. And often it doesn't come out exactly as we had intended. You know, we thought it and then God comes in the last minute and says, "No, he wants it arranged a certain way." And and I I was coming to the pulpit and been studying and waiting on God for a certain message to you this morning. And it just became changed around. You know, God changes things the way he wants to do it. And so, uh, Brother Paul Franos and I were just having a few words last night and and he made a comment and I I thought I'd pass it on with your with your consent or without your consent, Brother Paul. But he said you know uh when you brethren come you you have studied and you have prayed and and God has spoken something direct to your heart to the people and you have prepared yourself to deliver that. He said the thing that he feels is that you know the people and he was speaking of he himself but I think it goes for everybody needs to take the same kind of interest and the same kind of of of uh concern and you and and sincerity to prepare yourself to come and hear it. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; I believe that makes meetings entirely different. So let's come not just to the camp meetings. Camp meetings are special because people come with a special expectation. They come ready. They come more prepared. But let's do it in every service. &gt;&gt; Every time you intend to come to church, just be ready. Amen. And spend some time preparing for it. So I'm sure Thursday, August 11th, and Friday the 12th, Saturday the 13th, and Sunday the 14th, which will be just one service at the camp, and they will be great times. Then we have brother Zephaniah Peters from Tanzania. He was in Ohio in the meetings when I was there. And brother Zephaniah and and ourselves have been close for very many many years. Uh I think the first time he was here he stayed with uh brother David and sister Violet Laws at their place and they have a room uh you know they had made a room especially for hospitality and he stayed there for about 3 weeks I think and uh I don't know whether he's younger than brother David or older than brother David but because of the because of the way he was cared for he called him mom and dad mom and pop I think something like that. So, Brother Zephaniah will be with us. He's coming on August the 25th. So, we will not That's Thursday. He will we will not have a Wednesday service on the 24th. Uh and there will be no Wednesday service on the 17th, which is the Wednesday immediately after camp because we're just pulling out of camp. And there'll be no Wednesday service on the 24th. There will be a Friday service on the 26th with Brother Zephaniah Peters. And then he'll be with us on Sunday, the following Sunday. Uh the 24th, I'm sorry. Um that's the he's coming on the 25th, which is Thursday. We have a Friday service the 26th, 27th, 28th, Sunday the 28th. So now I know that you're confused and we're but we'll be announcing those as we go along. Uh I want uh I want to sing He'll do it again. So brother Ron, if you can help me. I some of these courses I can't quite get the timing exactly right and this is one of them. But I want to say he'll do it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the same today &gt;&gt; as he was yesterday &gt;&gt; and same as tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing it as we get ready for the word now. He'll do it again. He'll do it again. If you just take a look at where you are now and where you have been as you may now [Music] may not know when I do it again. He'll do it again. [Music] He'll do it again. Just take a look at where you are now and where you have been. He always comes through for you. He's the same now as you may not know how. You may not know it, but you do it again. You may not know how. You may not know how. You may not know it, but do it again. You may not know how. You may not know it. I'll do it again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we are now going to open the book, your word, the Holy Scriptures, the infallible word of God. We approach you as the author. We ask that your Holy Spirit will take the full control, have the preeminence upon speaker, upon hearers alike. We trust you. You are our only source, oh God. There's no one else we can turn to. You are our beloved lover of our soul. Lord, we are your bride. You are the bridegroom. And more than that, oh God, we believe the hour is even now when the lamb's wife has come on the scene. Lord Jesus, we pray that you will bless what is now to be said. And may I be silent where you would be silent and speak where you would speak in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll have you take your Bibles and turn, please, to John the 3 chapter. We'll read verses 11 through 15. I have been speaking on the uh rapture out of the last four services that brother Brandham spoke. And uh this may not sound as though it ties in at first, but it most definitely does. So I would like you just to uh bear in mind the last services that I have been speaking as God would refresh your memory in the third chapter starting with verse 11. Verily verily I say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and you receive not our witness. If I have told you of earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things, and no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven. That's where brother Brham said, that takes an inoculation. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. Now, you'll need to do some thinking. Uh I can say that the word and the this subject has been very very heartaching to myself and so I'm wanting desiring by God's help to have you as a congregation uh journey with me through my own experience the thing that I'm experiencing. And when I say that perhaps you see things in a different light just from a different direction than we have perhaps in the past. Uh everybody has a different background. I think all of us have been touched, affected, influenced one way or another by uh church thought, religion and the religious views or the understanding or denominational views of the scripture. I believe that there's just you know threads of that that uh follow through there. We have we all have an upbringing. Even some of the you is maybe we're not in a religious home but we hear things about Jesus and about his life and uh you know about Christmas and his birth and about Easter and his resurrection. And so we all have some of that in us and it may not always be uh accurate. In fact is in all likelihood it's not accurate. uh our physical and material world that we live in and our physical life which we have is perhaps our greatest uh stumbling block to understanding spiritual things in the scripture. And one of the reasons I say that is because as creatures of time everything for us has a beginning and an ending. Anything of any consequence in our lives has a beginning and an ending. And it's it's difficult for us to you know always be in contact with that kind of a world and be living and measuring everything having everything relative to time and and distance and so on and then be stepping on a Sunday morning or in your reading or you're hearing of the scripture and and and uh pursuing you know spiritual thoughts in the message and realize that God is timeless. And that's very difficult for us to understand. God is timeless. There is no distance with him. &gt;&gt; I'm leading up to something now. And because there's no distance with him, there's no such a thing as up or down. &gt;&gt; God doesn't come down in the sense of distance. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't go up. There is no descending and ascending. Even though it's in the scripture, but not in the sense of up and down in direction because you know uh up to us here isn't up on the other side of the world to begin with and and down is not the same. It's it's God can't know distance in that respect. We're we're timebound, gravity bound, humanbound creatures and our minds become bound. But we they need to be loosed from that. So we we that's why some of the scriptures become almost irreconcilable to us because it says one thing one time says another thing at another time. And so I'm saying these things just as a as a a beginning to some of the comments this morning which I trust will be provoking for you and and cause you to think uh deeper along these subjects because the key subject is the rapture. We we want to depart this place. But the departure is not so much a geographical change as I've been saying over the last three four services. It is first and foremost a a a changing. We need to be experiencing something different in our relationship with God. Our relationship draw me nearer nearer nearer. But there are many songs which we sing which are about you know heaven. I'm going to go up beyond the clouds and beyond the blue and all of that. And that may well be. I I I'm not here to really comment on that. But God doesn't know so much about distance. It's not so much about distance. In fact, as the prophet says that we're going to live the same life as we do now. It's it's just a continuation of the same life after death, but it's in another place. say it's in another place. We can say another realm. We can say another dimension. But I just want to go into the scripture in this regard. And Jesus made this uh uh amazing statement uh when he spoke and said, "And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven." Paul said in Ephesians, "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens." So now, not into heaven, but far above all heavens, that he might be that he might fill all things. I will suggest to you that the filling of all things is what Paul is referring to, that he was above heavens. He's higher. Brother Brandham says he was made so high, not in distance, but he said he was made so high that he has to look down to see heaven. I told you you were going to think. But if we get our minds locked that, you know, the earth is here and the heaven is here and Jesus somewhere up there. No, it's it's it's it's another realm. Let's say for example, you know, when when we're children, we know uh very little about things. We're full of questions. How does that work? And you know, you that are parents, you've had children just drive you crazy with questions because they want to know. But that's how they learn. And actually, mentally, they're gaining they're they're ascending mentally in their knowledge of things. They're ascending and and physically they become stronger and so on. They they're going through an ascension in that sense of the word. Spiritually, we are not you're not where you are where you were where where you are today. It's not where you were some years ago. Some of you groveling in sin and darkness and bound by habits of life and and and Satan just making uh havoc of your life. And now now life comes into control and God takes charge of things. It it's it's an ascension in that sense. You've risen up from that place. And so I want to I'm just getting your minds in that direction revealing the scripture says, "Can any hide himself in secret places?" This Jeremiah 23:24, "Can anyone hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord, do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord. So the scripture is really full of accounts, a number of accounts which I'm going to refer to today where God has is revealing himself in various degrees at various levels to his own which he purposed or elected for that moment or for that season. Now in the scripture when Jesus was here revealing because he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was revealing the invisible God. Is that not what the scripture says? He was revealing the invisible God. That was the purpose. All right. Now he spoke to the multitudes. The Bible says then there were other times when he drew 70 and brother Van calls them uh that ministers which he ordained called 70. And then there were times when the Bible says he took the 12 and he spoke different things to the 12 than he spoke to the multitudes. Now this is now he's making uh he's making distinction between the people his followers. And then there were multitudes that left him. The 70 also left him. And finally Judas left him. And you'll find Jesus just with the 11. And he speaks just with them. Then there are times when he takes just three, Peter, James, and John. He takes them up. And what's he doing? He actually leaves the 11 at the bottom of the mountain and takes the three up to the top. They were designated by Almighty God for a special visitation. They were the ones that saw the trans the transfiguration. None of the others saw it. Peter, James, and John saw it. It was designated for them. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God even in the re revealing of himself, he is showing that there's a certain order. There's a certain selection and he ordained some to see things and others perhaps don't see it. But that's all God's in God's program. And then when it came to a very very critical time where Jesus said, "One of you is going to betray me." And Peter wanted to know who it was. Now as as mighty an apostle as Peter was, he did not feel the intimacy that John had. John called the beloved apostle, the beloved disciple. And so Peter says to John, "Ask him who it is." And John asked the Lord who it was. And Jesus told John who it was. John told Peter who it was. And then they knew who it was. See? And so now I just gone down from the multitudes to one that laid his head on his bosom. And and there there was that at that time in the revelation of Jesus Christ. And in today, I'm not making I'm not making uh uh uh this isn't some major doctrine, but so that you can see immediately that the rapture is for a few. The rapture is for some that are going to enter into it. &gt;&gt; Not all will, but the rapture is for a number of people. And I want to believe that you have been called by a messenger voice and that that is the rapture call. &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, as I said a moment ago, I I want to go through a series of of scriptural accounts when God came down. And there is a theme here that I would like to have you bear in mind. And that is in most instances, not all, but in most instances when God came down, that man was lifted up. When God came down, there was that reciprocal action. When God came down, when God moved into man's realm, man was lifted up in one way or another or whatever. God. There was a reaction to that action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham said, "In Christ, the mystery of God revealed," and I'm largely laying foundation. I could just bust out and preach right now, but I'm restraining myself. He said, "The first thing that God wanted, we all have wants, but God wanted to reveal himself." That's what God wanted to do. That's what God wants to do today and that's what God will do tomorrow. He has that desire to reveal himself. I trust you have the desire that he will make himself known to you personally. He wanted to reveal himself to the people. But he couldn't do it as the great Jehovah God who covered all space, time, and eternity. He couldn't do it. And he said he could not. He's too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious. How can we understand God fills all time and space? He's here. He's on the other side of the earth. He's on He's at the outer fringes of the universe. If there is such a thing, he fills all time and space. How do you understand that kind of a God? He can't go up. He can't go down. He fills all time. There isn't any yesterday. there is no tomorrow because it's all present with God. We can't grasp that. But that God, that being and he is a he's the only God there is. &gt;&gt; He's not a series of gods. He's not a trinity of gods. He's not a multiplicity of gods. He is the God. &gt;&gt; He's a God who chose Abraham. He's a God who created a nation out of him and called it Israel. He's a God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He's a God who has selected Jerusalem. He's a God who called the apostles. He's a God who uh gave birth to the church. He's a God who has led the church all down the years. He's a God who sent all the messengers. He's a God who ordained them. He's a God who gave them the message. He's a God even though it was martyrdom all kinds of resistance and the world was opposed and kings was opposed and popes was opposed and princes was opposed the message could not be stopped because it was God behind it &gt;&gt; and God wanted to be revealed &gt;&gt; and it couldn't be revealed in some mysterious way. He was not going to have man stop him. &gt;&gt; He would have nations stop him and nothing can stop this message. Hey, they've tried to stop it for for a long many many years right now and it only increases in its intensity and the people in their maturity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there's no dark corner that it won't go to. &gt;&gt; Not because of our efforts, not at all. Because it's God. &gt;&gt; God is behind it. &gt;&gt; And he wanted to be revealed, but it would be too mysterious. He said, "How could that great being that never did begin that after you went beyond the s cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space?" Now, Brother Brandham, I'm scientific at this point. Years of light space. He's talking about trillions and trillions of years of light space. Light traveling at 186,000 miles a second. how far it goes in an hour and in a year and in a 10 years and a trillion years you do not have the capacity to even grasp that &gt;&gt; and so it would be too mysterious. So because it would be mysterious, God has chose uh other ways to do so. He said God is in his universe. He said God is just like air. He fills all the universe. Just saying these things so that I want to impact your mind with it sounds like it's saying the same thing but it's coming from different directions. No matter what size, he said in another message here ye him. No matter what size the circle is or how many people's gathered together, Christ is omnipresent. And he's the only being that there is that's omnipresent. The devil can't be omnipresent. &gt;&gt; God is the only one who's omnipresent. I'm glad I'm going to rejoice this morning that the devil isn't omnipresent. &gt;&gt; God is omnipresent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's everywhere and he fills the heaven and the earth. And then the message hear ye him. He said he's so big that he fills all the space and yet will become so small that he will come to a poor lost sinner's heart. That makes him great. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll come to one today that doesn't know him. He'll come to one individual. He'll come to a child that prays with a heart of faith. Isn't that marvelous? He loves to do that. &gt;&gt; And in paradox, he said, "Now, it was a paradox when God caused a woman to conceive. It was a paradox that how God the eternal that fills all time and eternity could come down and become one little baby crying in a manger. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't grasp that, but I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then God identified in his characteristics. Notice please because I'll be coming to this subject in the coming services. Identified. God identified by his characteristics. He said to the 70. Now he makes reference to the 70. The 70 sitting here, his ministers. he'd ordained, he had ordained to go out and preach before him. And he said, uh, he said, "I'll give them a shake and see where they're at." Now, he ordained these ministers, but now he says, "Now, I'm going to give them a shake and see where these ministers are at." He said, "What will you say when you see the Son of Man ascending up into heaven from whence he came?" And they said, now notice, the son of man ascending into heaven. Now he's he's pulling out from their minds their question. We fished with him. We lay on the river banks with him. We ate with him. Now you want your minds really quickened. He's actually speaking of himself also. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They fish with me. They laid on a riverbank with me. &gt;&gt; But they knew do they know who it is? &gt;&gt; Is it is it just a man that went through a a school &gt;&gt; in Kentucky to seventh grade? Or are they really getting who it is? &gt;&gt; Not the flesh man, but who it is that's speaking. &gt;&gt; He says, "We fish with him. We eat with him. We've seen the manger where he was born. We've seen the picture where the cabin where he was born. We know his mother, his brothers, and this son of man ascending up from where he come. He come from Nazareth. &gt;&gt; This is a hard saying. &gt;&gt; They walked away too. They said, "We can't see this. We can't see this." They could see him. They could see the manger. They could see where he come from. They knew. They could see his father, his mother, his parents, or and see his brothers, sisters, but they couldn't say who it was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's the that's the dividing line right there, friends. That's the dividing line. You say, "Well, I see a prophet or I I see a good preacher or I see signs. I see wonders." That's not enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "What happened?" Never move the disciples. Amen. &gt;&gt; They couldn't explain it and neither can I. &gt;&gt; You can't explain it, but you can rejoice in the fact that you can explain it. The disciples couldn't explain it. We can't explain it, but we can believe it because God has put something in here that causes us to believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He said, but in a paradox, he said, but real genuine faith don't move. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It doesn't move them. &gt;&gt; He says those disciples couldn't explain it, but they could they could but they knew there it was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It has to be something that God planted. Hallelujah. As I speak to you this morning, I'm confident that I'm speaking to a people that God has planted something within you to believe a word you cannot explain. And that is foolishness to the world. But it's wisdom to God. &gt;&gt; I have a people that can believe me. &gt;&gt; Abraham could not explain how his wife was going to be pregnantated and have a child in her old age, but he believed it anyway. &gt;&gt; And he he denied the deadness of Sarah's womb and the deadness of his own body. And God attributed that as the resurrection to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that God planted and it had to be his thoughts before the foundation of the world when he planned the whole redemption redeeming in Ephesians 1 and 1:5. Throughout the scripture, we have this uh we have so many accounts of the descending of God at certain times and in certain places. And I want and to specific people. And so I want to just now begin with this. You follow along closely. To ascend according to Encyclopedia Britannica is to go or move upward rising upward. &gt;&gt; And an ascendant. An ascendant is someone that is superior or the place of supreme power and preeminence. And to descend is to pass from the upper to the lower part. To lower oneself, to pass from the general to the particular. To pass, this is descending. To pass from the general, the great God that could not be grasped, that could not be understood, that could not be explained, came down. The general. The general. Not as in the army, but just the general description. God. People say God. &gt;&gt; God is referred to millions of times a day. God. But who is he? But when it comes down to the particular that it was Jesus Christ, then they couldn't grasp that. That God is in a prophet. They couldn't grasp it. So they slew them. When the great God, he said God was so mysterious, they couldn't grasp that. And he said the Jews when Jesus was there and that Jesus was speaking to them saying I and the father are one those people believed in the great God of Israel. They all believed in God in the general. But when it came down to the particular they couldn't grasp that descending. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; descending. They couldn't grasp that descending. He said, "Now it was a paradox when God caused a woman to conceive." I mean, on the same subject, how the great and eternal God that fills all time and eternity could come and become a little baby. They could not grasp the descending and things that are to be. See, I I speak it and then I want to give it in a quote. It was easy. He said, it was easy for those Jews who had been taught through generations. And I want to say to you sitting here today, listen to me close. There are some things that are easy for you to believe, &gt;&gt; but those easy things will not necessarily lead you in the right direction. Easy. It's easy to believe there's a God. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe it, something wrong with you mentally. It's easy to believe that Jesus Christ came and was a historical figure. Those things are easy. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's easy to believe he was born. Easy to believe. It's easy to believe that he died. It's easy to believe that he was resurrected because God did it. But then to believe that to see and identify God right here and now. As I was saying to the people at brother Roy Shrewsbury's church, brother Brandham, he gets talking uh out of Luke 24, which is the second from his last service, modern events made clear by the prophecy calling Luke the prophecy. I'm going to be harping on this quite a bit that all these last four God he said uh and there he is walking with the two disciples on the way to Emmas. And the prophet declares to the people who are listening to them, that same Jesus that walked with them then is here tonight doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; It was easy to believe it as a historical fact, but it's another thing to believe he's here now exactly the same. Exactly the same brother Roy as he was back then. Not one bit different. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can believe it, &gt;&gt; they couldn't believe it. The people he was talking to couldn't believe it because they were encrusted. &gt;&gt; They were encrusted with their denominational theories and doctrines. And they could not believe that that same Jesus Christ was there that very time. And I have to say that same one that was there that night when he was preaching is exactly here this morning as well. The same one Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can go home and read Luke 24. &gt;&gt; Jesus walked with the two men to Emmas. But I'm going to say to you that this morning on the authority of that word, on the authority of his prophecy that you're walking, &gt;&gt; you're walking with him. And you're exactly like them. You don't know it. &gt;&gt; You don't know who walked with you today. And maybe you mumbled all about your problems and your difficulties and the trials of life and all the rest of it. And he, you know, and said, "These are strange things. I have strange things happening to me. I mean, I would think that things would go different if I was really a believer. And here's a here here's the Lord Jesus Christ saying, "What things? &gt;&gt; What things?" &gt;&gt; And you're pouring out all your woe and everything else upon him. He's the same one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He cannot be any different. He cannot change one iota. He's the same. Jesus Christ the same yesterday. Say it. &gt;&gt; And today &gt;&gt; and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we in the forever? &gt;&gt; We're in today. &gt;&gt; He's the same. &gt;&gt; That is what this word says. &gt;&gt; The same. &gt;&gt; The same in character. The same in desire. &gt;&gt; If you can believe it, &gt;&gt; great things will happen for you. If you can believe it, &gt;&gt; if you can believe that if you've got them back there, that's easy. &gt;&gt; That's easy. If you can read, when you learn in grade 1 and grade two, you learn to read, you can read Luke 24. That's easy. But to believe that that same one &gt;&gt; resurrected is walking now here today with you, that's what will change it. To believe that this is Sunday, that's easy. To believe that this is Cloverdale Bible Way, that's easy. To believe that I'm Brother Ed Bisc, that's easy. To believe you are who you are, that's easy. But to believe that this God, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, that this God come down today, not yesterday, today, and is walking with you. That's a different subject. And that takes more than these two eyes. That takes more than these two ears. That takes more than this body. That takes the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; coming down into the regions of the soul. &gt;&gt; And giving you a vision. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And a conviction &gt;&gt; that no one can rip it out of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But to think, they said they knew this great God. But to think, for them to think that this God, that that God had come down &gt;&gt; and was manifesting himself &gt;&gt; through the person, that great general God had come down in the particular. &gt;&gt; That's that's always the problem. When the when that which is in general in reference becomes particular. &gt;&gt; The bride is a masterpiece that's general. We say amen. &gt;&gt; The bride is manifest in the end time. Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride is an absolute flawless masterpiece in the hand of the sculpture. We say amen. I'm a member of the bride of Jesus Christ. And we get a few less. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we say, I am a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now it becomes particular. &gt;&gt; Now the general has become particular. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not here speaking in generalities. We're not here. It doesn't do any good. It takes no revelation to speak in generalities, but getting down to the specifics. [Applause] And you have to be able to say by revelation, I am that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're sons of God. Wonderful. The sons of God have been called by God. The sons of God are blameless. We say, "Oh, amen." We have to say, "I am that son. &gt;&gt; I am that daughter." &gt;&gt; That takes something more. And let me say to you, my brother, my sister, in speaking in generalities will do you no good. &gt;&gt; And preaching in generalities will do you no good. You've got to know it as a specific particular I am that. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And this is not the power of positive thinking. &gt;&gt; This is not the power of positive thinking. This is not just getting you excited about something. This is something I'm saying has to be a reality down within your being. You have to know that this great God that is too mysterious that fills all time and space has come down in a great funnel called Lov E. Love. But he loved you. He put his eyes on you and he said, "I want you and I'm going to have you and I've ordained you. I've predestinated you. I've made you sinless by the power of my own life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I disregard I disregard your wickedness. I disregard your past. I've washed it away. And you are a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You know, we have a racetrack just down here a few blocks. Have a racetrack and a bunch of horses running around. horse flesh running around a racetrack. And the people get all excited and throw their hats in the air and stomp on the ground and jump and shake hands with people who don't even want to shake hands cuz their bet is losing. And then they made a bunch of slot machines &gt;&gt; and the people here didn't want them &gt;&gt; and the mayor tried to stop it and they tried to have it. We don't want it. They push it through anyway. &gt;&gt; And they got thousands, I suppose, of slot machines. You can go there early in the morning. &gt;&gt; And the yard has got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cars, &gt;&gt; not to church. Oh, and they get so enthused when a few that coins that aren't even silver anymore, &gt;&gt; pot metal, &gt;&gt; comes rolling out. Oh, I've won the jackpot. If they did, it come to a crackpot as far as I'm concerned. &gt;&gt; Just a one total failure. &gt;&gt; And here we come to church and you can't rejoice and we can't be happy. I tell you, my brother and my sister, it's time to awaken. [Applause] I'm not preaching on, but when they win a when they have a windfall and a whole bunch of coins or whatever comes running out, they don't say, "Oh, we all won the jackpot." No, they say, "I won it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what you have to know. They have to say, "We're all Christians." No, I'm that son. I'm that daughter. Hallelujah. I have won the jackpot. &gt;&gt; Glory. [Applause] Well, it was a it was a blessing to me, but I didn't know you were going to be so happy about it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. And the scripture starts to tell us now, if we can get to the subject, the scripture starts to tell us, "And the Lord God formed man." And before he could even form man, and the prophet mentions to, he had to come down, &gt;&gt; Amen. to the garden from wherever he was. There was no place he was because he fills the place that was &gt;&gt; and he fills the place that will to be. He fills all time and space. We still have that. Let's just stay lost in that part. He fills all time and space, but he came down to the garden. He he he caused the earth to be the womb for his seed. So he came down to that special place and he had a special place within the garden be within the earth because there he would have his son and his son's wife &gt;&gt; and God comes down. He's created the man in his image which he's a spirit. God's a spirit and he had a spirit man. But now, as the prophet said, he couldn't put his hands on the plow. So he now he's descended to the earth and he's come down to Eden and he takes now of the earth, the dust of the earth, and lifts that dust. That dust now begins to have an ascension &gt;&gt; in the hand of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When God comes down, &gt;&gt; something's going to go up. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And he began to lift the dust up. &gt;&gt; The dust of the earth, the lowest of the earth, begin to lift it up and form it into a man. Hallelujah. And when he had that man formed the way he wanted him, he breathed that breath of life into him. And man became a living soul. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that wasn't that wasn't the end of the ascension. &gt;&gt; Then he brought him up into immediate fellowship with himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That wasn't the end of the ascension. He took him higher and he gave him dominion over all the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he's not done his ascension yet. He takes him up higher and says, "I'm your father. I'm the God of the universe. You're the God of the earth. &gt;&gt; And Adam walked away. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; of the earth. &gt;&gt; What a place. &gt;&gt; And his wife came from him &gt;&gt; and was co-equal with him. and Satan threw the serpent because he has a certain characteristic that we'll get to. &gt;&gt; He's the one who said, "I will ascend." &gt;&gt; So now that's the only thing he's got locked in his mind. And he uses the instrumentality of the serpent. And the serpent comes to Eve and says, "You know, you can go higher. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can get wiser. In fact is you can be like God's. &gt;&gt; She was already there. &gt;&gt; But he was enticing her that there was something higher. There was something more. He was he was he was tempting her or enticing her with a higher uh ascension &gt;&gt; than God had given. &gt;&gt; You can ascend just a step higher. Oh my. Even in the natural realm, how Satan has ens snared multitudes of even believers, you know, and and and sisters of our age, you got more talent. You're being held down. You need to express this. You need to go somewhere and uh being under subjection to your husband's got you shackled. You need to get rid of these shackles. You can go places. Oh, how many times you tell a young man, you can go some places. You've got an ability and a talent in sports. You can never use that in the message. You can't. They don't have any place for you in the message. But oh, if you just get into the right channel, if you just get in the right place, can you ever use that? &gt;&gt; And he's got a snare for them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying hallelujah because of the snare. I'm saying hallelujah cuz we can see the snare. &gt;&gt; And he just got allurement. Oh, some young woman and she starts, you know, she's just a girl. She's just playing around with all the other kids and she starts getting into her young womanhood and she looks in the mirror and finally she says, "Yeah, I'm beautiful." Uh, and I got all the guys whistling at me. You got that? That's the snare. &gt;&gt; Something that God gave in a natural sense. Something that God gave. And so the devil's got all kinds of things. Now, if you just put on these kind of clothes and if you just do your hair this way and if you just put on this kind of uh you know cosmetics and if you just do this and do that and everything is everything is pointed in that direction. He just taking them down that road you know uh glamorizing the beauty and and thrusting her out into prostitution. &gt;&gt; And not the prostitution you and I know about the prostitution that Jesus talked about. If she dresses, and the prophet said, if she dresses in such a way to cause a man to lust after her, she's committed adultery before God. That's what Jesus said. Hallelujah. This message came to protect you from that. And so God now the woman is is Eve is being offered more light, the prophet said. And then comes what we all know as the fall from where God had them ascended to. God of the earth co-equal with co-equal in this realm she was co-equal with Adam not Adam ain't co-equal with God she Eve was co-equal and then came the fall came the descent brother Brandham said in blasphemous names what God did he breathed into him the breath of eternal life then he became a living soul and that soul can't die in the breach. He said he was god of the earth. God's the god of the universe everywhere. But his son had this earth under his own control. He could speak, he could name, he could say, he could stop nature. He could do anything he wanted to do. In a marriage and divorce, he says Adam and Eve were co-equal, one man, one woman. The woman sinned. And what does what does she do? He says that threw them all to death. Death now to die is to become prostrated &gt;&gt; which is to fall &gt;&gt; and that's what death means. So now it's a descent a descending and God had to make a covenant by that and another covenant. So he made another covenant now after the fall. And you say that is why he made the sentence to to the serpent and he fell and his body structure was changed &gt;&gt; and to Adam he fell from his dominion from his fellowship from his knowing of what to do. He lost the way of the tree of life and the cherubam were protecting that. He had no access to it. No direct access here. He just had an immediate fellowship with God. Now he has no access to the tree of life and Eve fell. So the whole thing was a fall. It was sudden. It was traumatic and it had indescribable consequences. Now, so after the serpent has has suggested that he's going to have an ascension and in fact that ascension is in fact a descending. &gt;&gt; What does that make him? A liar. &gt;&gt; He offers one thing and another comes from it. So now I just want to see where this came from. And Isaiah the prophet reaching into the eternities takes right what the what Lucifer said in his own heart. For thou hast said in thine heart. Now notice what a we we we we need a real revelation what a prophet is. A prophet can go not only into yesterday. Brother Brandham says to the woman you are praying and you hear me say this quite often but I'm trying to get across a certain certain uh uh qualification and a certain truth to you. He says to a woman, "You were praying at a chair in your bedroom before you came to this service and I can hear you praying." I say, "Where is he?" He said talks to another woman and says, "You were you were being examined by a doctor. In fact, two doctors and they are rather large men. I hear them speaking." And if you can go back a week another on another occasion, he says, "I see the doctor's report." &gt;&gt; And he told the individual what was written on the doctor's report. That's on tape. &gt;&gt; A tape you can hear. &gt;&gt; Where is that prophet? I'll tell you. He's in eternity &gt;&gt; where there's no yesterday and no today and no tomorrow. All is present. That's where he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. That is the truth. &gt;&gt; He's in an eternal realm. &gt;&gt; And if he can go back yesterday or last week or a year, what is the difference between a year and going back 6,000 years? That's what God did for Moses. Took him back some centuries and he wrote what happened in the Eden. Now we become so polluted and so indoctrinated with all kinds of false religion that God had to reestablish in the end time before he brings the world to judgment. He sends a prophet voice to tell you precisely what was spoken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isaiah Isaiah reached into heaven and told us and it was written down precisely what Lucifer said in his heart. &gt;&gt; In his heart. &gt;&gt; Is that too much? Do you believe Isaiah? &gt;&gt; Then you ought to believe William Brandam in this day. &gt;&gt; He says in the mind of God, in the back part of God's mind, where was it? Oh, back into some trillions of trillions of eternities. I don't know where it was, but here God has a vessel on earth that reaches right back into the into not even back. It might even be forward into the very mind of God to tell you what God desires. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be known. He wanted to be revealed. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be known as a father because he loved fatherhood. He loves when you can say from your heart from within. He loves to hear you say, "Father." &gt;&gt; The disciples said to Jesus, "How should we pray? How should we approach God? What should we say when we come?" His first words, "Our father." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He loves fatherhood. &gt;&gt; He's not just general God someplace. &gt;&gt; He's not just some general the higher power. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I just despise those those kind of you know what they are escapes. &gt;&gt; Don't say God, say higher power. &gt;&gt; They don't know who the higher power is and they don't know who God is. &gt;&gt; So really what's the difference? But when you can say the God who created heavens and earth is my God. And that God was revealed in Jesus Christ. And that God revealed himself in this day in the revealing of the son of man. And that God is my God. That God is my father. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he revealed himself in this time &gt;&gt; as a bridegroom husband. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, now it gets down to the particular, the very particular. And I am a member of his wife. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I have been into the bedroom chamber, &gt;&gt; and I am pregnantated by his seed. &gt;&gt; And thus, I have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Now, that's that's where it might just leave some folks behind, but that that's where you lost it. Don't let her leave you behind. When you get right there where your mind runs out of space, say, "Help me now, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help me now. Don't let me miss this." &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet's warning. Oh, it was easy to believe. &gt;&gt; Easy to believe we're in church. Easy to believe it's Sunday morning. Easy to believe that this ministers up here all enthused. &gt;&gt; That's easy to believe. &gt;&gt; It's a little different. &gt;&gt; You say, "I am that individual. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will ascend into heaven. I will ascend to the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high. I will ascend. I will go up. I will spring up. I will be exalted. That is what he was saying. I will be exalted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in Thessalonians, it says, "Let no man deceive you by any means. For that day, &gt;&gt; speaking of this day, &gt;&gt; that day shall not come except there come a falling away first, a descending first." Oh friends, look at the town, the city, the community. I don't care. United States, England, Germany, Africa, every one of them, China, Japan, Canada, we've descended &gt;&gt; to hell itself. You can say all the flowery things you want to, but the society is corrupted. &gt;&gt; It's rank. &gt;&gt; And it's filled with putrifying sores. &gt;&gt; Is there no good? Of course there is. They've been eating from the tree of good and of knowledge. But their knowledge, the more they expanded their knowledge, the greater to death they went. And the scripture says, "There shall come a falling away first." Jesus said, I'm sorry, the Satan said to Jesus, now notice, and sayith unto him, all these things, all these kingdoms will I give thee if thou wilt, if you will fall down &gt;&gt; and worship me. &gt;&gt; And that falling down is the same thing as dying. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you will fall down and worship me, give me respect &gt;&gt; and worship me. Satan tempted Jesus to descend by falling down and worshiping him. And the scripture says if you live after the flesh, that is a descending. How many young people are tempted, especially once you get out of school, you know, you begin to enter the work world and you're thrust into the community of the people uh work people. You come into a relationship with associates and so on and you have to work side by side and and uh uh have a have some kind of uh you know community spirit with them. and how easy it is to start crossing the lines, the border lines from your convictions of your own heart and compromising and then a person begins to live after the flesh. And the scripture says, "If we live after the flesh, you shall die." Exactly what it is. You shall fall. If you live after the flesh, you shall descend. And as long as a person lives after the flesh and they continue to pursue fleshly pursuits, &gt;&gt; they will decline. &gt;&gt; And I've seen homes decline. I've seen families decline. I've seen individuals decline. I've seen great professions of faith. Oh, I'm a believer. I want to be baptized. all the rest of and I see them start you know Satan allures them or some enchants them and they begin to decline just the the the declination becomes very subtle sometimes it's just a missing church doesn't it's to me a lot of people have to miss churches we got bus drivers we got business people we got all kinds of things they have to miss church that's another thing that that's to me that's different not entirely different but it is different I don't think anything should dominate us and anything should not be uh a dictator to us. But when people just willingly well you know um I might hear I might stream tonight. You want to be sure that it's not uh you know it's not something that is commencing you on a declining direction because if you decline you are descending and if you're descending I ask you where are you descending to? Now, the scripture says, I'm just going to throw this in. For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. The man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. In other words, Paul is saying that man was not taken out of the woman. when the woman was taken out of the man. &gt;&gt; In fact is Eve was the only woman taken out of the man &gt;&gt; in that sense of the word &gt;&gt; because all other women were born by a sexual natural birth. Then the scripture says neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man. And Jesus was the only man that was born of a woman. Born through a woman, but she he was not of the woman. &gt;&gt; Jesus was not Jew. He was not gentile. &gt;&gt; Eve was the incubator that carried him. But the seed was the seed of God. And the blood, the scripture says, was the blood of God. &gt;&gt; He was not of the woman. The woman was of the man. And Eve was the only woman who was of the man. And the fall came through the instrumentality of her being seduced by the serpent. And the whole fall came. And look where we are. The graveyards everywhere, cities of the dead we call it. And that is that is when a person fully becomes prostrate. fully. You're laid out and you're buried. And as far as as far as time and beginning and ending is concerned, that's an end and a conclusion as far as life is concerned. Oh, how I thank God that God descended. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to take you through some more. I need to take you through some more for another few minutes, please. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, two vines, the prophet says the woman Eve was the tree of death. We all taste of her. We all taste of her because we are living a life. This is a life that we are tasting of this life. We all taste of her being born in this world. And as sure as we're born of a woman, we've got to die. We are a paradox here today. I don't care who you are. If time is to go on and if a rapture and a change of these bodies does not transpire in our time, every one of us is destined. It's appointed unto man once to die. On one on one hand, we are in a physically as mortals, we are in a decline. Physically mortals. I notice no one said amen. And that's fine. But you are declining. You're older now than you were this morning when you walked into church. and time taking its natural process, you'll get wrinkles and you'll lose your youth and your energy and your strength and all the rest of it. And you can do all the aerobics you want, but it will finally catch up with you. You can eat all the health food you want. You can eat all the organic stuff you want, but it'll finally catch up with you. And one day, even though you don't admit it to anybody, you'll say, "I'm getting older. I don't even get out of bed today." You know, I don't want to tell you about my treadmill. It's rusting upstairs. You will say that. And that day will come when people they will pass by if it happens to be that way. And you'll not be erect and you'll not be with your face and your eyes dazzling and and you're full of energy and vigor and and all the rest of it and energy uh uh for life and zest. You won't be that way. &gt;&gt; You'll be laying there and the mortician will make you look as nice as possible. &gt;&gt; I've been around too many of them. And people pass by and I've said it. I don't mind saying I don't mind admitting it and say they look so peaceful they're not even there. &gt;&gt; Oh, they look so peaceful. They're doing one of two things. They're either screaming &gt;&gt; the torments of hell &gt;&gt; because they have gone to another place. &gt;&gt; They're not in that box. They're not in that nice satin and silk. &gt;&gt; They haven't got their head on a nice pillow. They're in hell. &gt;&gt; Jesus said so. And if Jesus said so, can I say so? &gt;&gt; And there's others that have taken one step and that body dropped down and they went into another realm. Hallelujah. And they had a they stepped into the body. They bypassed &gt;&gt; in the Garden of Eden. They bypassed it. their theophony body and they stepped into that theophony body. The Apostle Paul said, "If this temple, if this tabernacle be dissolved, this one, point to it. If this temple be dissolved, we have another." &gt;&gt; Not we will have. &gt;&gt; We do have. &gt;&gt; Do you know why he had to say it that way? Is because it is eternal. It's Aeonian. He said eternal in the heavens. And eternal could not say we will have it. We have it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in the mind of God, you've always had it. &gt;&gt; You descended. &gt;&gt; You descended from the very thought of God. &gt;&gt; You came down all through the generations, as I've said previously. And you've descended down through your forefathers, down from one seed, mingled with another and another and another. And God watched over your lineage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he mixed this one with this one until he just get a certain tingle. And some of your forefathers went through wars and went through battles, but God preserved them. &gt;&gt; They came close to accidents. They came close to death, but God preserved them because in God's mind, you had to come &gt;&gt; and you would come. &gt;&gt; And when the appointed time would come, God by his spirit, the great God who's just general, people know him as a great God, but that God came down and in a particular way spoke words to you. The man that led me into the ministry was on a dance floor. &gt;&gt; He was on a dance floor dancing probably back in the days when they were doing the Charleston or whatever more. And while he was on the dance floor, his name is Chad. Few people here know him. God spoke and called his name. Not his full name, but his known his his this name he's known by. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Chad, sir, &gt;&gt; this is not the way. He walked out of there off the dance floor immediately and went to his stood beside his car and gave his heart to God and from that day forward lived all he knew to be the truth. &gt;&gt; I say friends, that's when that general God becomes specific to you. And you have to confess it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, God sent a God sent a prophet." That's easy. &gt;&gt; That's Malachi 4. That's still easy. &gt;&gt; That's Luke 17:30. That's still easy. But when you say that God that revealed himself in that messenger is my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that message is my message. &gt;&gt; And I live by it. &gt;&gt; It is my mandate. Then that God has become particular to you &gt;&gt; and you have to confess that &gt;&gt; or it will not work. &gt;&gt; When you confess it, the high priest moves on your behalf. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I go just a few minutes? &gt;&gt; Adam had no knowledge of his ascending. He didn't know he come from the earth. He just took a step one day and there it was. All creation. Wow. There's all the animals coming. Oh. And his father said, "You're in charge." &gt;&gt; In fact, his haven't been named yet. I want you to name them. &gt;&gt; Oh, but he had such a mind that'd be easy. This is a lion. And that bird up there is an eagle. And this over here, there's a lamb. And and his father was saying, "You're exactly right. You're exactly right. That's exactly what it is. That was what was in my mind. You got the same mind. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he did know when the fall came and he became faced with death, faced with the dead son Abel. Then he knew from where he had fallen. He had knowledge of his descent, &gt;&gt; but he had no knowledge of his his ascent. &gt;&gt; Today, because we're creatures of time, we also through the memory channel, we can remember kind of where we were and where we come from, but we don't have as good an understanding. And we we we think about and people I I just say that this just happens to be a reality of life. They think about the the the present and the difficulties and the past and all of those things. And Satan so desires to come in and remember and he wants to you to recall your descent &gt;&gt; where you were where you descended into and your problems and all of that. He wants you to be mindful of that. But God is saying you're ascending. You are ascending. He wants you to think about your ascent. &gt;&gt; And we don't have the same knowledge. We don't have the same understanding because we can't really see exactly where we're going. What's it all about? What it'll be like? Oh my. I wish I how how can I anticipate it? &gt;&gt; Well, you just have to take what has been written &gt;&gt; and believe it. &gt;&gt; And say it's far beyond. It's too mysterious. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe what I cannot understand. &gt;&gt; Here's a few times I'm going to go quickly. Right after the flood, children of Israel decided, I mean, what not children of Israel, excuse me, the people decided they would build a tower to reach up into heaven because we don't want this destruction anymore. Whatever was in their minds, they don't know. And the people were all of one language. And the Bible says, "And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of Israel build it." He didn't come down in the sense that he was so many light years away and came down. God came into the realm of man and where he was and what he was doing and to see not even see in the sense of knowing. God can't learn. &gt;&gt; God's God. He knows exactly what they were doing. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what their intent. He knew everything. But he came down. There's an aspect of God you just have to think about. But I don't want to dwell on that much longer because I want to go on immediately to another place. He says, "I will go down and see whether uh I will go down to see the city and the tower which the children of Israel of man builded." Then there's another occasion and now he had uh spoken to a man Abram and I won't give it in story form but Abram left his he told him leave your kindred leave your families and go to a land that I will show you and he had a man that believed him and he got him out there and he appeared unto Abram and Abram built an altar and worshiped God. God coming to Abram. There's there's no Hebrew nation. There's no such a thing as children of Israel. The earth is full of tribes, but has no people of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; All it is is human flesh, idol worshippers, Abram himself being one. And God called &gt;&gt; and that man started an ascension. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He started ascending. &gt;&gt; Separate yourself. And he's ascending further. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go to a place that I will show you. And he's ascending further and higher. And he appears to him again. Says, I'm going to give you seed. And he ascends higher and higher and higher. He's in an ascension because God came down. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then because he was a special friend of God, God came in various ways and showed himself in the form of Melzdc and a theophony and and they had you know they had some uh conversation and so on. But then he comes now he comes listen closely because I'll be coming back to it. God actually has his his eyes and his vision at another as far as time is concerned in the in the relationship to the peoples of the earth. He has his eye way thousands of years beyond Calvary, beyond the prophets and the kings, and beyond Calvary, and beyond 68 million martyrs, and beyond a Luther, and beyond a Wesley, and beyond an age of great signs and wonders, and there comes an end time. And in his own mind, he knows from this, he knows from his word, he must bring this earth to judgment. But before I bring it to judgment, I will come again myself &gt;&gt; in the form of Elohim. &gt;&gt; And I will tell people the secret of their heart behind the back of my servant. And so in order to do that, I must do it now and lay a seed down for them to believe in when that time comes. [Applause] because we can only live by word. &gt;&gt; And that's where his eye is fixed up ahead for you, &gt;&gt; for me. God himself came down in the form of Elohim &gt;&gt; and ate meat and butter and drank milk &gt;&gt; and a meal that Abraham had fixed for him and his wife &gt;&gt; Sarah. And he's laying down a scriptural pattern. And he's lifting he's lifting his son by coming down as Elohim. He's going to lift him up now. He's separated. He's he's he's promised him, you're going to be the father of nations. It hasn't happened yet, but you're going to and he's going to lift him from a childless barren state &gt;&gt; to be a father of a promised son &gt;&gt; that would be a type. He raises them higher. He'll be a type of my son, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Oh, he'll be like him in every way. He'll even carry wood like a cross of a mountain. and there'll be fire and wood and you'll offer him as a sacrifice because I am going to offer my son as a sacrifice. I'm lifting you up in an ascension until you're going to until you are even a type of me &gt;&gt; and your son will be a type of my son &gt;&gt; and he lifts him up by coming down. He lift up this our father in the faith. I'm going to give you a son. Sarah, your wife, is going to conceive according to time of life. In the next 28, 30 days, she's going to conceive and bring forth a son. Oh, my brother, my sister. And he laid out a word, and I'm going to give you the key now. for a people in his mind. You were not even born yet. You were still in the mind of God, but you had to come down &gt;&gt; into into this darkened darkened hour. &gt;&gt; I start getting a song. God came down in this darkened hour with signs and wonders and mighty power. God came down in resurrection life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In this hour and if he had not come down, you wouldn't be going up. &gt;&gt; Because he did come down, you are going upl. And your ascension hasn't completed yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this same word that you believe to get where you are now by believing that same word, you take your final step and step into the eternities. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He descended &gt;&gt; one like under the Son of Man descended into a burning furnace &gt;&gt; with a king, a powerful king, the power of the earth, and three men in the furnace. God descended down with them and ascended them. They began to ascend above the power of the flame, above the power of the smoke, above the power of the king, above the power of his armies. And they walked out and the king looked in there and said, "I put three in and one is there. There's four and the fourth man looks like the son of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Those three men walked out &gt;&gt; because he came down in this generation. &gt;&gt; According to Revelation 10, he descended. He came down. And because he came down, you're going to walk out of this death. &gt;&gt; You're going to walk out of this darkness. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's according to his word. &gt;&gt; Perhaps we can pick up on this &gt;&gt; the next meeting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I say praise him. Praise him. &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love him. That's why I sang He'll do it again. &gt;&gt; That's what I was referring to. That's what was in my mind. He'll do it again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, this isn't just some little excitement. This is glorious truth. &gt;&gt; You live by it. &gt;&gt; And he'll stand by it. &gt;&gt; Deny everything else. Deny the enemy. Deny the devil. Deny the liar. &gt;&gt; He's the same mighty God. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think maybe brother Rod we ought to sing as one of the songs. They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't bend, and they wouldn't burn. &gt;&gt; I love that &gt;&gt; because here's another group of people got the same son of man walking with them. We won't bow, we won't bend, and we won't burn. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] If you think I'm beside myself, I say like brother Brown, just leave me alone. &gt;&gt; I'm enjoying it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And want to sing a verse of He's the Lord of glory after that. Let's sing. Should we sing the chorus first or No, I guess it goes into it, doesn't matter. Start off. Yeah. Can we get you to put on the screen? There it is. Here is a story from the good book we know. A story about a miracle that happened long ago. We hope that you'll take courage when temptation you meet. There's somebody watching you from when you're weak. They wouldn't bend. They held on to the word of God. We are told they wouldn't bow their knees to the eye of the gold. They would burn. They were protected by fourth manif and they would bow. They wouldn't burn. Prophet Daniel tells about three men who walked with God. Shadrach, Meach, and Abednego. Before the wicked king they stood, and the king commanded them bound and thrown in the fiery furnace that day. The fire was so hot that the men were slain who forced them on their way. When the three were cast in and the king rose up to witness their awful fate, he began to tremble at what he saw. In astonished tones he spake, did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? But lo, I see four men unheard, unbound, and walking down there. There's Shadrach, Meshack, Abednego. In the fiery pools they trod, but the form of the fourth man that I see is like the son of God. They wouldn't bend. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't bow. &gt;&gt; Word of God. So we are told they wouldn't bow. They would not bow their knees to the idol. They wouldn't burn. They were protected by the fourth man in the fire. They wouldn't bend. They wouldn't bow. They wouldn't burn. Oh, they wouldn't bend. They held on to the word of God. So we are told they wouldn't bow. Would not bow their knees to the idols made of gold. They wouldn't burn. They weren't protected by the fourth man in the fire. They wouldn't bend. They wouldn't bow. They wouldn't burn. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Uh but behold, what manner of man is this? Not not the whole thing, just a couple of verses. Uh the one especially about Yeah, you'll see it when you get there. What number is that [Music] of glory? He is the great I am. He's the alpha and your bean, the beginning and the end. His name is wonderful, the prince of peace. He's the everlasting father throughout eternity. The fourth verse. Behold, what manner of men is this who stand between God and man? His eyes are as a flame of fire and maned in his hair. John saw him in seven churches as the son in brilliance see. Behold what manner of man is this. What manner of man? Well, he's the Lord of glory. He is great I am. He's the alb of the beginning and the end. His name is wonderful. The prince of peace is he. He's the everlasting father throughout eternity. Behold, what manner of men is this who sits on his heavenly throne. He rules and reigns from heaven above, his beloved and his own. He's the lion of tribe of Judah, the root of David is he. Behold, what manner of man is this? What manner of man? He's the Lord of glory. He is great. I am, the Alpha, the only God, the beginning and the end. His name is wonderful. The prince of God is he. He's the everlasting father to eternity. Oh, how wonderful. &gt;&gt; How great is our God, our gracious, loving heavenly father. How thankful and how appreciative we are for what you have done. Not merely in the past, but what you have done in bringing us to this place where we are. And truly, we can say you have caused an ascension. There's an ascending power. There's an ascending order in our lives. We see it, Lord, in the company of the saints. We see it as we travel from church to church and city to city. We see it as it's taking place around the world. And I pray, oh God, though the world themselves may mock and laugh, one day it'll be the last smile, their smile on their face will turn very, very quickly to sadness when they realize, oh God, that there's some folks that are turned up missing, oh God. And there's an ascension taking place right now that they're not aware of, they're not conscious of. But Lord Jesus, as you were taken up and you were received into a cloud and you you went out of their sight is what the scripture says. Oh God, this is certain to take place. I for one, I want to meet by your grace and only your grace. Lord, we know it would only be possible by grace. I want to meet those who are redeemed and bloodbought and that we will rejoice together there. But we won't wait for that time. We will rejoice now and we will give you glory now and we'll cast down our throne, our crowns and everything before you now. Lord, we give you all the praise and all the glory. Thank you for this wonderful uh attendance and group of people that are here today and all those that Lord Jesus around the world in different places are listening. We say God bless them and may the Holy Spirit enter into each room and each place where they're gathered. I ask oh God to be a just a special presence and that you will do for them what is needful at this time. We pray Lord for those that are standing here today. Some may be bound. Some perhaps have not been released. Satan still is holding a grip on their mind and upon their lives. I pray you'll come to them. And in your coming to them, not in a general term of God or of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, but the Jesus Christ of now. You'll come and draw close to them and may you speak their name. May they hear your voice. Come up higher. Separate yourself. Come out from among them and be separate, say the Lord. May they hear that voice. May they respond as Abraham did immediately. Bless the people and Lord, we're in great anticipation for what you have from service to service. And tonight, her brother Tom Ray will be ministering. Lord. Oh, I pray you'll anoint him mightily, oh God. Send forth your word into our hearts. Bless the people now as they are refreshed. In Jesus Christ's name, dismiss us now we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's one announcement that the all the sisters working in the kitchen in either the food preparation or sanitation department, please meet directly after the service in school room number one. And that's only for five minutes apparently to confirm some scheduling. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Happy birthday. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] What's up? [Music] Do you [Music]
