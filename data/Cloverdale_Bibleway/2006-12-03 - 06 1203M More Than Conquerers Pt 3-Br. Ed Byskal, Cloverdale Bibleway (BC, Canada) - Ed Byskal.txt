There's a testimony from Sister Elena. Uh she wants to thank the Lord for getting my green card and being able to cross the border. Thank everyone for their prayers. U we want to remember this morning's a request from brother Hugh that we remember a former coworker Mike Craraver. He's living in the states. He has cancer of the spine. Is in a lot of pain. He's thankful for the prayers of the saints. I want to remember him this morning. and also brother Ernie's uh away in Minnesota having meetings. Want to remember him this morning. If you've got a need, you just lift before the Lord. He's here this morning, saints. If you got a need, just take it to him this morning. If you're listening in on the internet, our God can meet your needs. John, oh Jesus, we just find ourselves at your feet feeling like that lady. Lord that saw the world and saw the mockers not having no time for you and she fell at your feet with her tears. This morning we have tears of thanksgiving and gratefulness because of all that you have done for us. If each worshipper could just take a step into their heart and give back to you what you deserve, surely this congregation would erupt. It would erupt. Our mouths couldn't wouldn't be able to contain the glory that you deserve. You deserve so much more. A thousand tongues, a thousand lives, Lord. Lord, our services are not to be a one-way street to where you give and you minister and you pour in, but we are here to worship. We are here to give. We are here to love. We are here to communicate back and express ourselves. And let us not be silent. Let us not be distracted, but let our attention be at the feet of our savior. We love you this morning, Jesus, more than anything in this world. And we want our hearts to be clean and right. As in your presence, Lord, everything of this world just fades away. All of the darkness, all of the remorse, all of the selfishness. Oh, Father, let your Holy Spirit come breaking through into every situation, into every mind, into every soul, into every need right now. Lord, this is not a gospel of just 2,000 years ago or even 40 years ago, but you are in the building this morning. You are the healer, and we are here as your children to be healed of our infirmities. Deliver us, oh God, as you pass by this way, those that are bound and crippled spiritually, let them reach out and touch the Lord. You are so near, Lord. You are so present. You inhabit the praises of your people. So Lord, we praise your holy name. We enter into your victory, oh God. You have been victorious in this generation. Every shackle, every dark cloud, every bondage you have broken through. And for that we give you glory. You are not bound to our culture. You are not bound to our countries of origin. You are the God that is above all things and you fill all things. Fill these hearts of ours, oh God. Fill these hearts. Fill these souls, oh Jesus. We magnify your word, Lord. Every syllable, every line. What an opportunity to be in your house today. That we can unbburden ourselves at your presence and know that you know all things even before we ask and you're much more willing to give than we are to receive. So would you pour in your Holy Spirit, Lord? Hands are lifted up needing a touch. Unspoken requests that's needed. Our brother Hugh has written in and others Lord are traveling on the field. physical needs, financial needs, direction, your presence to come through your word and minister a life that is more than our natural life. But we pray for them. Our brother Tony going to Brazil, our brother Ernie in Minnesota, our brother Timothy in Vietnam. So many laborers. Lord, I pray that you would anoint them today and anoint the service. Oh God, there are laborers in this service that are laboring for our good. musicians and sound and video and deacons and our ministry that will be coming. Lord Jesus, we appreciate these things. We appreciate the brother that's next to us, the sister that's next to us, our children, the older ones, the younger ones, one body, one faith, one word. So would you be glorified today that no flesh would glory but you would come down sovereignly and deal in every situation and every issue God withholding nothing that you would just pour it in so much that we wouldn't be able to contain it Lord and go beyond our expectation. If we ask for you to fill us Lord and you answer that prayer we should be happy when you start pouring yourself in. by your word and by your spirit just vindicating it. Oh God, those on the internet and phone hookup bless them. Touch our lives today. May your spirit continue to deal mightily in our lives and we'll give you glory and praise and honor for we love you, Jesus. And we thank you already. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen Lord Jesus. Amen. You can have your seats. [Music] &gt;&gt; And we want to welcome everyone that's visiting with us today. We're happy to have you here with us and uh trust that you'll receive from God's hand today. Our brother Jonathan Waldner has a song. Brother Jonathan, if you could come and get ready at this time. Um, we want to, uh, make a special welcome to, uh, Brother Nathaniel Iverson's parents, uh, Brother Hank, Sister Danielle Iverson. Also, u, Brother Nathaniel's sister, Esther, and her daughter, Lee, are here with us. May we get them to stand so everybody knows who you are. They're going to be here fellowshipping with us for a while. God bless you. Happy to have you here. and uh any others that are visiting with us, we want to make sure you know you're real welcome. Um also uh there will be a young people's service this Friday, December the 8th at 7:30 here at the church. So uh I know some of the young people were wondering about it and uh there will be a service this Wednesday, December the 8th. Amen. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. just uh wonderful what he's doing and uh sometimes the situation he gets situations he's get gets us into and uh we don't know exactly why we're there. Pray for me. I've got a couple of interesting situations I'm going to be in this week and uh I just need the Lord's help. Amen. Because I don't know why I'm in them. So, but he does. So, Lord bless you, brother Jonathan. This is a little song I wrote called uh why don't you thank him? Uh just talks about uh why we give him thanks during hard times. You know we give him thanks in good times and bad. So sometimes you go through a hard time and you just you just want to thank him anyway. So uh the tempo at home was getting a little quick but I'll try to keep it slower. Slow down. Just tends to get away on you this one. All right. [Music] As the days go by, you're tired and you're weary. Seems like you can't find peace and quiet anymore. I sure don't think you'll find it in this world that's passing by. But I know you'll find it on the other side. Why don't you thank him for what he's done and what he's going to do? Why don't you stand for him and give your best? Because he'll stand for you. Why don't you give your all the way he did for you on Calvary? Why don't you thank him for what he's done for you? [Music] You strive and work so hard to make ends meet. Seems like you're always running for the next thing. I think it's time to quiet down and rest your weary feet. Just realize he's provided what you need. Why don't you thank him for what he's done and what he's going to do? Why don't you stand for him and give your best because he'll stand for you? Why don't you give your all the way he did for you on Calvary? Why don't you thank him for what he's done for you? Why don't you thank him for what he's done and what he's going to do? Why don't you stand for him and give your best because you'll stand for you? Why don't you give your all the way he did you on Calvary? Why don't you thank him for what he's done for you? Why don't you thank him for what he's done for you? &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Jonathan. &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate some of the songs that Brother Jonathan's written. Amen. We should thank him every minute of the day. Amen. Certainly. I just Well, I know I'd be really messed up if I didn't have the Lord. Amen. And I'm sure and I know all of us would be in the same boat. Amen. And we just want him to lead us and guide us every day of our lives. Amen. Because you know if he does, that's where you're going to be the happiest. Amen. Praise God. I just want more of him. We're going to turn to the word now as brother Biscll comes. Let's sing that little song we uh we sang a couple of weeks ago. More of you and less of me. Amen. That's what our prayer should be. Amen. This flesh just gets in the way. Amen. We want more of him. Amen. We want him to take over. Amen. and then we'll be able to manifest his perfect will in our lives. Let's sing it together. Amen. More of you and less of me. Oh Lord, I pray that there might be more of you and less of me. Oh, I want more of you. That's my prayer, Lord. last me. Oh Lord, I pray that there might be more of you and less of me. Like the grain of wheat that falls to the earth and dies to live a new. All my plans and earthly desires I lay them down to follow you. Oh, I want more. Lord and let us [Music] pray and bear my dream. More of you and less of me. I want more of you and as oh Lord I pray that there might be more of you and less of me like a grain like a grain of wheat that falls to the earth and dies to live a You all my plans and earthly lives. I live now to follow you. You are God. How great and care for you and me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nice to see you all here. &gt;&gt; Full of expectation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We got victory over the snow. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; We're so happy it snowed us in last week. &gt;&gt; We got snowed into the church and we couldn't couldn't leave so we just let the preacher preach. We enjoyed the meetings immensely. Our brother Timuit, he enjoyed being here with you also. It was a wonderful spirit. It was just the Lord. It was just just the right time, the right word, the right servant. Everything was perfect. &gt;&gt; I thought just perfect. The Lord just thought, you know, uh this is going to be special. So, I'll just allow the clouds to dump snow down. And so, you know, you know what that does? We we didn't have anything else in our mind. &gt;&gt; We weren't worried about running off home for dinner. We didn't know if we could get home. Didn't know if we could go any place. So, we just stayed here. Uh that was wonderful. &gt;&gt; That was really special. &gt;&gt; And uh you know, it just created a whole atmosphere. Actually changed the atmosphere in the congregation. I sensed it right away. Hey, we have nothing better to do. Really? Really, we had nothing better to do. I know we can say that, but you know when everything's nice and the sun is shining and you know you want to get out and you got plans and all the rest of it. God doesn't really want that on the Lord's day. He just likes us to be closed in with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when we really feel that way and have that uh that sense that we are just clo enclosed with him in a secret place, then you'll find the atmosphere will be different. We just enjoyed it so so very much. And uh there was a lot of people that streamed. There was 190 locations that live streamed the meeting while it was on. And in the week from then till last night four 40 47 have listened on the archives. So there's big a big c when brother brother Puit saw that he said that he just realized there's a big congregation out there that was also uh fellowshipping with us and that's wonderful. Uh, I know that many of you know, I suppose perhaps all know that our sister Rebecca Smith, brother Brandham's daughter, passed away and that her her viewing, they're actually having a viewing today in Tucson. And then there'll be just a family private family uh service and internment tomorrow in Tucson. So, we want to remember as a congregation, I know that you have prayed. I've I know that many of you wrote notes in the uh on the online guest book and uh we just found that yesterday ourselves and so we've sent condolences but let's pray for them. It be really a great loss to the children Angela William and Steven and then their spouses and and their family their children as well. So, especially Brother George, which most everyone here knows in a personal way. Brother George, Sister Rebecca were here for perhaps two or more years. So, we are remembering them. She's the first one of the children gathered with her father and mother on the other side. And I can tell you they have no twinge of sorrow. It's not possible for them to have any twinge of sorrow. We experience a heaviness but they can't have any heaviness. And we're we're so for that part we rejoice. We're thankful. I'd like you also remember if you'd remember myself in special prayer. Uh every just frequently different ones say well we were praying for you this morning. I was Matt said we prayed for you till end of the we hours this morning. Uh that for the service today that really is wonderful. I appreciate that so so very much. Uh this next Sunday I will be in uh Brazil with brother Tony. Brother Tony leaves today and will be there a couple days ahead. Uh we will be with brother Cesar. That's a brother who has uh he's built a a church there in this uh in a certain city up on the coast north of Rio. And uh he's the brother that has a he had the local television broadcast and then the congregation here, members of the congregation made it possible for him to go nationwide to all 19 provinces of Brazil. And uh so um he has arranged that uh he wants to make some some broadcasts and you that were here you saw some of the broadcast. I thought it was really remarkable. He standed on water for probably 45 minutes and preached on baptism and that was really remarkable. He's been getting letters letters. I mean they're they're almost inundated. This is where brother Tony is such an assistant to them because it helps them to set the thing up because they weren't aware. I asked the question and sent a question to him as soon as he talked about having this going nationwide. What are you going to do to the people that respond phone and want something want a you know want a want a you know a message book or something? What are you going to give them? And then that's what they woke up to. Now they've got several people working steady working full-time responding to these requests and ministers and churches and people from all over the country. And it's a large country. It's I understand the fifth largest country on on the planet and very large population. And so uh we also have assisted brother Tony spent a number of weeks down there and Steven Keer was there. uh something has happened in that development and that is that one of the the first church that invited me to come down and it turned out that brother Febiono who was here Februio I should say who was here and had a great burden for Mosmbique because they're Portuguese nation and also Angola who Portuguese he had such a burden for them and traveled over there many times and saw many many works established He had such a burden but there was no message book. So I said well you should be translating them here and then brother doa can print them in Africa and we'll do what we can to see that uh that the printing is is supported and paid for and then as soon as you people can get your act together here you should run the office you know yourselves and we will uh we'll step back and step out of the way. They said oh don't don't leave us. Don't leave us. Well, now they've stepped forward and they've said, "We think that we're about ready to take the whole work over." And and that is the first time first time in all the years that Bible believers has been established where we've been able to uh be an example to a whole nation of of this is what works. It works in India. It it's working in China and it works in the Philippines and it works in the Ukraine and it it it actually works and you and the people receive it's under the leadership of the local pastors which is the way it's supposed to be. Each church is sovereign. You brethren, you know what's needed in the country. There's nobody from somewhere else in the world that's telling you what to do. Uh that's exactly what the message teaches. But but something is actually built that is ongoing. it is uh it it it works, it functions, it's successful. And they said, "We've seen that and now we want to follow that pattern, but we need you to help us." So, we did. We've been helping him now for a couple of years. And it's and now it's just happened as of now. And that's one of the main purposes. Brother Tony will be there to see a transition take place to the local pastors to take it and assume full responsibility within the country. And I think that's wonderful. Abs absolutely remember to pray for them. It's a it's a big responsibility and then we will continue Lord willing helping the uh people in Mosmb beek and you know to us sitting here today we talk about Mosmb beek and Angola and the far away places but I guarantee you you'd have a paradigm shift in your minds if you just saw that those doors open and saw those people start flowing across this platform &gt;&gt; and if they looked down and said we we heard We heard of God sent a prophet in the end time. We believed, but we don't know what he said. We don't have any message books. They told us, "Oh, we'd love to." And they looked down into your faces and said, "Could you get us could you get me a book?" You'd have a paradigm shift this morning. &gt;&gt; How fast? About that fast. You'd say, "Brother Ed, what can we do?" And we're doing what we can. There's been uh when I spoke last brother Dioa 29 messages have now been printed. They've printed in in at Shakina publications for Mosmb beek and and Portuguese speaking people. I just say praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I just want to as far as I'm concerned I just want to uh spend our lives doing that. That's our passion. This message is precious and we want others to experience it as well. And so, Brother Cesar, he's uh he wants to make about six uh TV broadcasts, three each day for two days, and then we have a meeting Saturday night, meeting Sunday. I'll be with them Monday, come back on Tuesday. So, you pray for me. I'm not as uh I'm not 30 anymore, even though I may act like it sometime, but uh anyway, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I would like to sing as we get ready to turn to the word uh 246. We are more than conquerors. Brother Rod, if you can help me with that, why don't we stand? We'll get ready to read the word. Also, I'll be reading on John the 14th chapter and also from Isaiah 14. Sing this as a reality. It's a theme of our service this morning. We've been more than coners over in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been made victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ. Everyone together. We've been made more than coners. [Music] overcomes in this life. We've been made glorious [Music] &gt;&gt; through the blood &gt;&gt; through the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Once more everyone, &gt;&gt; we've been made [Music] over in this life. We've been made victorious by the blood of Jesus Christ. Would you bow your heads with me into your hearts as well? Almighty God, creator of heavens and earth, giver of every good gift. Truly, you have been gracious to us. You've been gracious to your children. You've provided us with all that we've needed. Truly, we can say, Jehovah Gyra, the Lord hath provided. Not only will provide, but you have provided. You've brought us here this morning. Lord, you have given us strength. You've provided our needs. You have poured out your spirit. You have opened up your word. You have sent us your servants, oh God. You have sent us your message. You have sent us your prophet, oh God. You have confirmed your word. Lord, you have sent your presence amongst us. And Father, today we thank you from the very depths of our heart for what we sense and what we are experiencing at this moment for the light. For you truly have said, "Let there be light." And we can say and there is light. We praise your name. We are those Lord who have risen because the light has come and you have said in your word rise and shine for your light has come. We say glory to your marvelous name creator of light and life. And now, Lord, I pray that you will enlighten our minds and open our eyes and our understanding as we look into your word and read. And may we be profited by these meetings. All who are streaming now. Lord, pray your holy presence will enter into every room all over the globe. Oh God. Oh Lord, how wonderful it is that we can be linked together. And I pray they will feel and be one with us in spirit and in truth. In the name of Jesus Christ, I surrender myself and yield myself to you, Lord. Pray you'll bless in wonderfully the service this morning and this evening. Oh God, that your presence will be abiding with us in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. [Music] In John 14, I want to begin reading at the 19th verse. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more, but ye see me. Because I live, you shall live also. At that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. Many of you who had me sign your Bibles, that's the verse that you have in your Bible. of all the letters my father wrote me and uh uh instructed me, this is the one scripture that it seemed to leap off the pages of his letter and he gave me John 14 and 21. And when I read it, it seemed it was different from all other scripture for me at that time. Been my favorite ever since. Judas saith unto him, not Escariat, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him. That's down to verse 23. And I just want you to notice uh verse see here and the 19th verse. Yes. Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also. If you'll keep that in your mind. And then in Isaiah 14, I want to read from verse 12 just down to 17. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations? For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit. They that see thee shall narrowly narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, and the that did shake nations, that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof, that opened not the house of his prisoners? And then I want to I would like to just read from uh Revelation please the sixth chapter the opening of the seals. And I want to read the opening of the third seal which is verses 5 and six. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, "Come and see." And I beheld, and lo, a black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, "A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny, and see thou hurt not the oil in the wine." God bless his word to our hearts. You may be seated. Now I'll need your undivided attention as we just uh seek by God's help to bring these thoughts together. The opening or the purpose of the opening of the seals was to give us insight into the time and the hour that we're in. It's not just some mere history. That's not the purpose of it. It was to give us some insight and also knowledge of the time that we're living in and the conditions that you and I have to deal with. And that's what the opening of the seals are all about in our own strength. And as I read about now, we've we've been touching on these four horse riders, but in our own strength, we are no match and we are not capable of uh of of being able to withstand or to know, I would say, the tactics and all of the infiltration of Satan in our modern society. You go into the shopping mall, I can assure you he's influenced everything that's there. You walk onto the streets, you mingle with the people, if you were go to a sports event or if you were to go to a political event, I can assure you that this crafty, cunning enemy has infiltrated every one of those areas. And so, how are you going to know where your enemy is? How are you going to be able to determine? And I can assure you, there's no person that can fight a successful battle unless they can identify where their enemy is. It's a very very dangerous thing if you are a fighting person in a war. Uh it's it's an unnerving thing to have a hidden enemy and you can't find them and you don't know where they are and you have no knowledge of them. You have no knowledge of where they are. That is why war modern warfare today and all the sophistication of the weaponry which is being devised is to try to determine where the enemy is. having all kinds of uh uh radar gear and and uh all of the instrumentation to try to locate where that enemy is. And one of the most difficult things that they're having even today uh within Iraq is they have not fought this kind of a war before where people come even dressed as women or dressed as just innocent people and normal everyday people riding a bicycle or driving an automobile or whatever more. And then uh the the those that are all equipped and uh very clearly evident fighting men and women find themselves in the midst of a horrific explosion and every day it's happening &gt;&gt; because the enemy is hidden. &gt;&gt; At least what they call an enemy is a hidden enemy. Let me tell you something friends. It would be unlike the God that I know to leave his children ignorant and blind uh not knowing where their enemy is to tell them on the one hand this is the most cunning this is the most deceiving of all enemies most deceiving but somehow you can never find him. No, it would be it would be uh it would be incumbent upon God to pull the covers off and at least say to his children, "Here, I'm going to do two things. I'm going to I'm going to open your eyes and give you eyesight so you can see it see him. And number two, I'm going to tell you where he is." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what the opening of the seals when you just hear that phrase, let it be known to you, it the the seals have been opened ultimately to give you victory in this life, to give you eyesight, to give you divine knowledge and to equip you so you don't have to be uh uh swept away with uh things that appear to be something that they're not. Now, don't forget just a couple of comments about deception. Deception. If you really want to talk about deception, deception would not be deception unless it is made to appear so attractive that people desire it. &gt;&gt; Eve became deceived and she desired. She desired the very thing that Satan was offering through her through the embodiment of the serpent. She desired it and it was pleasant to look upon the enemy. Satan is not some cloven hoofed horned thing. It's not that. He's far more cunning than that. He comes in in all kinds of different ways. And I don't want to spend time on it. But that is why when the lamb himself opened the seals and made possible the content and revealed what was in the seals. And then he would send it down to a a a confirmed vessel, a vessel that had already been proven, a prophet vessel mouthpiece that had already been proven year in and year out. for hundreds of times and thousands of times so that the people have no excuse. As Jesus said, I did not say any of these things in a corner. We have people that have got their prophets and messengers and whatever more uh over in the eastern countries, prophets, the word prophet is not something unusual at all. Soon as you speak about a prophet in Asia, they simply want to know what did he say? They want to know. They're curious to know what kind of a messenger. But you won't find any that stood before the people and revealed the secrets of the hearts one after the other after the other after the other for over 30 years and true every single time. I say that God did something special. What he did, he confirmed a mouthpiece that he was going to speak other things through. And we say, "Oh, that's wonderful." you know that God spoke that spoke those things and revealed the secret of the heart. But it to me it's even more wonderful much more wonderful that God would open the eyes and the understanding of his children and then say look this way children look over here. Here he is. &gt;&gt; Here he is. He's trying to hide here. Trying to hide behind behind religion. Trying to hide behind politics. But you just watch them join together now and alert you and I warn you. And here a prophet comes and says religious powers, political powers and demon powers. He's uniting them all together in this end time and homogenizing the whole thing. But there will be a people and there is a people who are not duped by that. &gt;&gt; They can see it because they've been given eyesight. And the scriptures which we've read, Jesus said, I'd like to just tie one thought together immediately. Jesus said, "Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more, but you see me &gt;&gt; because I live, you shall live also." So now we have two groups immediately. Some that can't see &gt;&gt; and some that can see. when we read about Lucifer and we read about him uh with his boast how he will ascend and so on so forth and yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit. And there's a very very wonderful statement here and it says they they that see thee, not all will see him. Not all will be able to identify him, but it's identifying a certain group of people here that will actually see him. And when they see him, when they can identify him, the Bible says they will narrowly, narrowly, in other words, that word is is that they will stare and ponder and they'll be able to identify him. They'll look right at him. And when they do, they look upon him and they will consider him saying that what they see will cause a response within this group of people and only this group of people. And they'll say, "Is this the man that made the earth to tremble? &gt;&gt; Is this the man?" And look at the insight they get. That did cause the nations to shake and is this the man that made the world like a wilderness? And is this the man that has destroyed our cities? And is this the man that doesn't open the house of his prisoners? &gt;&gt; I tell you what, they got clued in &gt;&gt; this group of people. And I'll say it's the same group &gt;&gt; that Jesus said, "The world won't see me, but you'll see me." And this is the same group that also because God sends a prophet's voice, a messenger, and pulls the covers off, they can see him. And when they see him, they look narrowly on him. They stare and ponder and consider, "Is this the guy that bound me? Is this the guy that held me? Is this the guy that destroys our cities? Is this the guy that ruins our schools? Is this the guy that's in our politics? Is this the guy that brings our hospitals full of the sick and the afflicted and brings us down into brings them as prisoners and we refuses to open the door of the prison house? &gt;&gt; Is this him? &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; There's a group of people that's been given some eyesight. &gt;&gt; Thank God there's a group of people that are not fooled &gt;&gt; by the environment that's around us. I say thank God for the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've been given eyesight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of that eyesight, they that see thee, we see him, &gt;&gt; but we've also seen another one. We've seen the mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we've heard his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the seals there was a rider on a white horse. That's this fellow had a bow and no arrows. Then I took a service on the transition because with his bow it was in his time of having a doctrine but he hasn't got any power to enforce the doctrine. and some little deeds were taking place. They were carried over into the early church and uh he didn't have power to enforce what he felt he needed to. He needed a power. And so the in the transition between the white horse and the red horse which was the cruel time of cruelty and martyrdom and the time when he dispensed with a bull with no arrows and ended up with a sword. In that transition period that transition was a marriage of the church and state and because because they had to have the power of the state. So they had to unite the religious power and the political power because now through politics he could declare war. They could say kill these people. They're heretics. There are enemies. They could identify and make enemies as they still do today. they decide that the certain uh nation is a threat to freedom or a threat to democracy or whatever more and someone on the other side of the ocean or the other side of the world decides that America's a threat or England's a threat or France is a threat or Germany's a threat and they and and then they they create are you you know some kind of a uh uh emotionalism and whip the people up and and suddenly people that you thought were, you know, just common people like yourself. They have families and they have children and they have homes and they they love their children and whatever more. But suddenly they they become enemies and and and politics causes that. But the church now gained the power through the politics and was able to say they're our enemies and you go and kill them and slay them and you do God a service &gt;&gt; which is still happening today. I've got pictures, I think I showed them here once, and I won't go into any detail, but where some of the Arab people, actually, Palestinians, we're taking young children, like we have sitting here in the front seats, 10, 11, 12 years old, not even into their teens, and strapping them with with with fake bombs to make them ready when they're 16, 17, 18 to go with live bombs, but indoctrinating them of the great reward that they would have. Well, I know if that were me, I know what I was like when I was a kid. I'd say, boy, if that's such a great reward and you're going to get so many such a reward and so many virgins are going to welcome you to the glorious place, you lead the way. You show me how it's done. And after you've done it, I'll make my choice whether I want to or not. But you don't find any of these fellas. I'd say when they have these world wars, they ought to put the world leaders in the boxing ring and let the best man win and let all us poor people go just free. Wouldn't that be better than slaying all our young men and all the rest of it? Well, that's politics. Politics is rotten. And as long as this world is governed under this fellow, &gt;&gt; and don't get me wrong, I think that I think that the the struggle for freedom and everything has been a huh has been a necessary thing and God saw there were going to be these birth pains on the earth. We were going to have these world wars and these things were going to happen. But that's not God's. I can assure you on the other side there would be no such a thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; No such a thing as what whatsoever. And then this rider, he changed from a a red horse now to a black horse with a pair of uh balances or scales in his hand and uh controlling economics, but he could not hurt the oil and the wine. And then he there's a transition from there to a pale horse. And the brother Brandham goes into considerable detail in a number of places that it is the pale horse is actually a combination of the white horse which is deception, the red horse which is cruelty and the black horse which is the darkness and then on the on the pale horse that's what makes the pale horse. In other words, that's a power and we are we are living in a time now. Brother Brandham says that the pale horse rider one place he says he's doing his last ride now another place right after that the next sentence is that is after the church is gone and taken from the earth and he certainly will perfect his his right at that time but this would it would be hard to believe that he is certainly not or that the transition is taking place in that it is so incredibly difficult a person needs a divine fine instrument of discernment to be able to determine and to decipher. Look at how many look how many jobs and and and positions there are today. I would say that there's scarcely one position that a person can't be into. But what I don't care whether you're a school teacher or whether you're a nurse or whether you're a preacher or whether you're a truck driver or a farmer, whatever. At some point in your occupation or in your profession, you're going to run in a head-on collision with this fellow. &gt;&gt; I don't care where it is. You're going to run into him somewhere and there's going to be a twins down inside that witnesses to you, I can't go there. I can't go there. I can't go any further. And you have to declare yourself. And suddenly, you're the oddball out. &gt;&gt; You're the odd person. &gt;&gt; And you're looked at differently from that time and treated differently. And it can be very, very innocent. How about when uh a man works for professional a financial institution, he's going on up the ladder, up the ladder, up the ladder, and uh he just knowing in his heart he cannot be transferred that God wants me here in this place. He wants me in this town. And so he tells the tells the senior executive people, I'm not up for a transfer anymore. I feel that I need to reside here for his own spiritual reasons. And they said, well, you know, that's the end of the road. You can't go any place here. In other words, you're in a you are at a dead end. And that happened to be brother Tim Dodd. And now he's pastoring a very very nice work. But he had to know within himself, I can't go any further. And so his his profession actually comes to a dead halt. &gt;&gt; But as far as God is concerned, that's just really when things begin to happen for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now the Apostle John, he was commanded with this with these words. when the when the seals were opened, he was commanded, "Come and see." And many years ago that stood out to me and I spoke a message on it. And again, this last week and especially as I move towards the service, I couldn't shake away from that. So, somebody here needs to hear what I'm going to say. Now you'll find that God's uh the way God deals with people is in this in a twofold manner and one is he attracts the people that's the come part and then but the coming does not open the eyes the coming does not meet your need in the ministry of Jesus Christ we'll just say all of his early ministry turned a, you know, he began to heal the sick and Peter's mother-in-law with a fever and the child raised from the dead and the multitudes fed and water turned to wine and all of these supernatural things. That was the come part of his ministry. And the people flocked to hear it and said, "What glorious things are coming?" Is not this the prophet? We have a prophet from Nazareth. And they were ready. They all moved on the invitation part and came. But then when it came to the only the only way, the only avenue, the only channel by which they could actually have sight was by by the words that were spoken. And that's why he said to the disciples, "The world won't see me anymore." Why? Because they were not going to receive his message, &gt;&gt; but you will see me. &gt;&gt; How are they going to see? It had nothing to do with the physical eyesight. And it had nothing to do with just being taught and being instructed or being indoctrinated. It's another system. It's another program. And the program is that we hear the word and believe the word. &gt;&gt; And once we hear it and believe it, then a Holy Spirit ignites that word and it it comes to life and we see it. &gt;&gt; It is a it is the act of revelation by God that actually gives insight. you you see something and let me just say to you and I'm not I'm just saying to you by way of confirmation to any person here because I begin to examine my own self. I begin to say to myself, what is it that God has revealed to me? I've learned a lot of things in life, but what is it that he actually has revealed to me that came as a revelation? I can tell you the serpent seed message have been a revelation. I can tell you that Malachi 4 five and six has been a divine revelation. And as when I think of those things again, I get that feeling, that excitement, that stimulation, if you want to say it that way. And as I pondered the things that I know were revelations to me, then I can assure you there isn't a devil in hell and Lucifer himself that can ever take it out of you. It is there and it's there eternally because it is eternal. It's part of God's word. If you just learned something, &gt;&gt; if you're just made to be convinced of something, someone else who's smarter and a better talker may convince you out of it and may convince you the other way. And there are some people who only learn the message. Brother Brandham makes an makes an example between the woman at the well who had not been taught. She was even confused. The Jews say we're to worship in Jerusalem and the Samaritans say we're to worship in this mountain. I don't know where we're to worship. All she knew is there was a difference of opinion on worship. We could say, well, we got the Baptist over in 64th and we got the free Presbyterian over here on 188th, I think it is, and we got the Salvation Army, the East Indian just around the corner with a with a a temple there. A little temple used to be Jehovah's Witnesses. So the Jehovah's Witnesses are over there. We got all of these different people. They worship this way. They worship which is the way to worship. Jesus said how to worship in spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; And God must confirm. He's duty bound to confirm his truth. How? Supernaturally. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said the woman at the well said but the priest when the priest saw Jesus Christ and make himself known they said bellub. &gt;&gt; But when the same man made himself known to this illiterate woman she said Messiah. &gt;&gt; There was the difference. One could say Messiah &gt;&gt; and one could say Belub and they hear this message and some say Belub, but the others say Messiah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that happens to be as far different as you can get. That happens to be the most opposite of all polls. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I say Messiah. A revelation of this word to me is Messiah. &gt;&gt; But he said the difference between the woman and the priest was the priest learned it. &gt;&gt; He learned what the law had said. He learned how he was supposed. He learned that he should have a Passover. He learned all of these religious acts and religious things. And so but when it came and the and Christ uh the manifestation of Christ and what Christ was speaking cut across that then he turned away from it. Said it's Belub because it was in opposition to what he had learned. But that what he had learned didn't bring a life. What he had learned didn't bring him insight. Didn't give him sight. But Jesus said there'll be a people they won't see it. To them it'll be error. To them, it'll be heresy. And to others that say, "It's the devil. It's Belubam. It's of the devil." I feel sorry for them. &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I believe it's unforgivable sin. I believe it's blaspheming against the Holy Spirit to take what God did in this generation, as clear as it is, and say it's of the devil. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've had people I don't advise you to say this to do it, but I've had people resist vminently this message. And I just said to them, say, say to me that Brother Brandham was of the devil. And they just look and I said, "Say it. Say it." And I'm glad they didn't. As far as I'm concerned, that's unforgivable sin where Jesus said it will not be forgiven in this world nor in the world to come. And brother Brandham says the coming of the Holy Spirit in this day. It's a serious time, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad &gt;&gt; God gave you eyesight? &gt;&gt; We don't just see him. We also look narrowly. I see Satan in every corner of our in every corner of our whole environment. I see him everywhere. &gt;&gt; I see him want to tamper with everything that he possibly can get his uh dirty hands upon. And and I think we ought to be ready to declare, Satan, you have no part with this. You have no part of my home. You have no part of my life. You have no part of my environment. I can see you. I look narrowly on you. I can stare at you and stare you down because God has uncovered you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I feel almost like stopping preaching and just giving God glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for eyesight like we have. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful this morning? Somebody think, "Oh, this is just wonderful." And you say, "Not for me. I think it's a big trap. &gt;&gt; This looks like great opportunity. I think it's a snare." We got two different words for it. I think things are going great. I'm sorry. I don't think they're going so great. For me, they're going great for God's children. They're going great. But as far as the community at large is concerned and look at how they struggle and strive to make things, I think that they ought to make things as good as they can. But we don't have the answer. We don't have the answer in the city hall. We don't have the answer in the county. We don't have the answer at the state level. We don't have the answer nationally. We have the answer only through a message that came. That is the answer that we have. You might say, "I'm a fanatic." Well, I'll I'll speak as long as I can as a fanatic and leave this world as a fanatic as far as that goes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the same people will turn around and as I've said many times before, they look at your lives and admire, admire it and desire it, but have not got the wherewithal because they have not believed. And without believing, you have no eyesight. As long as that resistance is there, you have no eyesight. And so we can see it in in Moses. Let me hurry along. In Moses, look at look at the coming part. Look at the coming part here. He meets and the Bible says that he saw this sight of the burning bush and he said, "I will go and see this burning bush." Brother Brandham said God was attracting his prophet. He had to attract him first. &gt;&gt; So he attracted him and then when the prophet got attracted and the word came to him, he was able to go down to Egypt and then begin to demonstrate this God that he had met. God's not afraid of showing himself. He began to demonstrate this God. And through that, God attracted the people. Not only not only the children of Israel, but also mixed multitude. They said, "We've never seen anything like this. This has to be the true God. And so, we're going to go after Moses, God. We're going to follow Moses. Moses is God's prophet." And these people all came and went out. And so, that was the come part. That was the coming out part. And then, how now, now then what happened? But God wanted them to see who it was that was speaking. And it was not until Moses went up into the mountain and came back down began to tell the people what God had said. And by hearing what God was said, the people now God was now defining himself what kind of a God this is, who this is. And so God, don't forget this, defines himself, defines who he is by word. &gt;&gt; It's his word. He speaks his word. And that is how we see him. Right. &gt;&gt; And then when the people saw who it was that was speaking, now all they saw with their physical eyes was a mountain burning with fire and and heard with their literal ears the rumbling of the mountain and the great thunder and saw the great darkness also come over the mountain. And then they decided that was too awesome. That was too fearful. Don't speak to us anymore. like don't have God speak to us directly like that. Said to Moses, "You speak to us. You go up and get it and come back down." And Moses began to give him the word, give him the word, give him the word. And that's what gave them eyesight. Then they begin to see who God was. And that multitude, you know what happened? Died in the wilderness. But the Apostle Paul says, "We are not of those who draw back." &gt;&gt; What's he saying? He's talking about a group of people that draw back. &gt;&gt; And this multitude that Jesus came that came out to hear Jesus and hear the glorious things and see the marvelous works and swept up into a euphoric state saying, "This must be our king. That's right. &gt;&gt; We want to make him king. And tearing. Don't tell me they weren't stimulated. They tore the branches off the palm trees, waved the palms, took their jackets off, their coats off, their their garments off, and strew them down and let the little uh animal carrying the Lord Jesus uh come over them and and waving and shouting, "Oh, hosana, hosana in the highest." &gt;&gt; And it had to be so. Jesus said if they stop the rocks are going to immediately cry out. They had to do it. But it was only a week later. The same mobs were saying crucify, crucify, crucify. Why? Because they did not see him by his word, they didn't hear his message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the same people today in this hour when the Lord Jesus Christ manifested himself and came down in visible form. When I say visible form, how visible can you get? Setting the giving eyesight to the blind, speech to the dumb, casting out the deaf spirit as I heard yesterday saw the brother Vandom speak and just speaking so simply. and here's a person and they can't hear. He said now it may be a nerve. It may be a nerve that's gone dead and it'll have to be life will have to come back and it'll take some time. But he says but it's a spirit. It's a demon spirit that's caused this and cast out that spirit and that person gets their hearing again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. how God confirmed himself over and over again. But then when the word when God begins to define himself and show who he is and speak his message out, those same people, &gt;&gt; those who sat on the platform, those who enjoyed and reveled in the supernatural, turned from the word, but that was God. And that's the only thing that gives you eyesight. &gt;&gt; It's only the spoken word that can give you eyesight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this word come, I'd like to give it to you in the uh in the actual Greek because there's a there's two or three things that are very very beautiful to it. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; When this word come, because there are a number of words that can be used in the Greek, but this one here is this kind of invitation. come from one place to another. The intent is not not just come here, but the intent is I want to move you from where you are to another place. &gt;&gt; Come. And so the living creature, the beast said, living creature said to John, "Come." And you know, we were represented in John. &gt;&gt; Come. I I know. And I pondered this as I was studying yesterday. I thought, "Oh, God, the people I'm going to be talking to, there's a I trust it be 100%. I do not know." But they've heard they've heard an inner invitation. And I hope that they realized that when God gave that invitation for you to come, his intention was to move you from where you are &gt;&gt; to where he wants you to be. And I believe that even as we hear the word meeting after meeting that there's still that element there, God's purpose, God's intent, he wants to move you from where you are now &gt;&gt; to where he intends you to be. And you might be sitting here defeated. You might be sitting here bound. You might be sitting here having struggled with something till you're almost ready to give up. You might be sitting here totally lost. I don't know. You might be sitting here just defeated, mentally wore down. I want to tell you, God wants to move you. And he wants to use this service to say to you, come out of there. &gt;&gt; Come move from that place. God has a plan for you. And he wants to move you from where you are now to where he has a place for you. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you, it's not a place of defeated. It's not a place of defeat. It's not a place where we c excuse me cower under the under the power of the enemy. It's not that kind of a place. It's a place where you have you have power over him. That's why I said we are overcomers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is also to arise. It is also come is to be established. I want you to be established. And this is very very important in this day because I can tell you from my perspective and from my vantage point I see a lot of people today and they have not become really established. I believe that they believe the message. I believe that they have had an encounter with Jesus Christ, but for whatever reason, their roots have not gone really down deep. And if you're going through a shaking time, I say, "Praise God for that." God wants your roots to go down. God wants you to be established. And there's there there's there that is one characteristic that cannot be substituted by anything else or cannot be developed by anything else and that is stability. I always think of Abraham faithful Abraham the prophet preached faithful Abraham because you find him and I use the word plotting. Abraham plotted. Oh God, give us people today that are absolutely unmovable &gt;&gt; regardless of what happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; To be established, come. Be established. And the last here that I have chosen under this come is to follow one. This is an invitation to follow. Not just a spurt in a moment, but to follow one. I know a little bit about following people. And the more dangerous the thing is, the more closely you want to follow. And uh I I'm just going to make this brief, but I had an I had a situation once where a young native man was had been charged by uh a couple of white men. And these white men were evil men. And they had tried to get this man to get them a a prostitute. And he said no. And they struck him with a bottle of beer, a full bottle of beer. Struck him on the head and took and laid him out across the railway tracks, the British Columbia railway tracks, because they knew a railway come that night. and he woke up prior to that and got off the railway tracks and he was wounded and these men had charged and these men had charged him and uh charged him with an assault. They charged him with an assault and they struck him and tried to murder him. And so he was my he was my friend even though he wasn't he wasn't a Christian yet. his wife became a believer. And so I took I took up his I took up his cause and I went to a lawyer and I said they tried to tried to put this man in jail, tried to get him an assault and it's completely those men ought to go to and serve time. I told him the story. They represented him and the case got thrown out and he was a free man. Well, his daddy, actually his grandpa who raised him as a dad, he came off his trap line one day and he says, "There's a huge grizzly up there and I killed a black bear and I think that grizzly is going to come on that black bear." He said, "You know, go into town, get Ed, cuz he wants he wants a grizzly." And so George came into town to get me. And actually he he he he delays a couple of days and finally calls me and so we we leave and we go up there and we cross a river and we go up this road a long ways not driving now we're having to walk. I think they took us into the farm tractor and then left us. And so we we spend this afternoon walking and we come to where this bear had been killed, a big black bear, and there was only one little bone left. This animal had eaten the hide and the hair and all the bones and the skull, as thick as a a bear's skull is, ate everything up. And and I can tell you, he the the the ground was just as smooth as this carpet right now. And I looked at that site, said, "Boy, this fellow knows what he's doing. This guy's nothing to play with." And so we made our way back. It was a beautiful hot day, and we're making our way back. And it just soft powder dust on this little trail, little old old mining trail or something. And I saw the biggest tracks I ever saw. And when he saw it, he said, "Who? Who?" And this this boy knew what he was doing. George knew what he was doing. He says that's maybe 15, not 20 minutes old, that bear. And you know what he did? He actually was following us, but we didn't know it. And we stopped at a little fishing hole just to sit there for a bit. And that bear walked around us and walked in front of us. And then we came on his tracks. I lie not. I laid my hand in the heel across the heel. That was the width of his heel from there to the end. That was just the width of his heel. And we measured the length of it and we figured his paw was 13 in long. He was a massive bear. They figured he weighed over a,000 lbs cuz he stepped on a goodiz log and broke it. And we were going and I knew he was just 15 and the willows were thick. And here's this here's this native brother friend of mine, George, and he's going through the willows. Do you know where I was? Right on his tail. And he said to me, he was nervous. He said, he said, "I I'll I'll try to track him. You watch for him. Do you ever see an owl? I tell you what, I I had I had uh I was looking every direction and I was the only one packing a gun. I'm packing this gun and following this mammoth bear. He outsmarted us that evening. He outsmarted us and I don't know how he did. We were right behind him. Now, here's my spiritual truth. in this wilderness, in this devastation, in this generation, I would say, of smoldering ashes everywhere, God has laid out some footsteps for us to follow. And they're none other than the footsteps of the Son of Man. And you need to walk in them very carefully and see where the next one is and see where the next one. And don't move off that trail. Don't move off that track. I tell you what, friends, it isn't red willows that's our problem. It isn't a grizzly bear. It's a guy that has ridden into this generation. We're not talking about history. I'm talking about a cunning rider who who who watches as things transpire in civilization. And when he can't achieve anything on on the horse that he's on, on the power he's on, he watches the powers of the world and he gets on the other one. Now, I can't really do what I'm I can't really achieve what I want to achieve here in the church. And so, I better set up I better set up a council of of cardinals at uh in Washington. I better set that up also in London. And I better set that up in in Ottawa where they are. And I better set up and and there's a marriage and there's a union that's religious and there's and here we are little people down here. We're trying to sort things out. Thank God for eyesight. Thank God for a word. And that word, friends, when you read it, it's not a message book. It's vision. &gt;&gt; It's eyesight. &gt;&gt; It's knowledge. &gt;&gt; It's revelation. &gt;&gt; Am I getting somewhere? &gt;&gt; And he didn't say just come, but he said to see. Now this attraction part he he said that divine healing usually attracts usually attracts and draws the attention of the people. He says then that attracts the attention of the people to know that there's a presence of a power somewhere that can do something that's beyond the human understanding. Isn't that a powerful statement? Listen to it again please. when this invitation has come this part of there was part of brother Bren was a part of Jesus ministry part of Moses' ministry it's all through the scripture and he says that is to attract the people quite frankly I haven't got enough time this morning to tell you but I see people that come and they come to the church and it depends on who it is but I'm a very very cautious person very cautious. You say, "What are you cautious about, Brother Ed?" Well, I know that here for the most part is the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ, and I'm very zealous over it. And so then I ask, what what what are they attracted to? What is it that they are attracted to? And they're just attracted to, well, you know, you got nice stable families or you got lovely young people or you got fine young ladies. I would like something like that for a wife. You got fine young men. I'd like something like that for a husband. That won't work. &gt;&gt; That won't work. That's not why we're here. Or we got a nice program for the children. Or we got a school or we got this. What are they attracted to? Want to know that down inside they're attracted to the very very Christ that you were attracted to. The prophet said that the bridegroom, the bride is attracted to the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Who is the bridegroom? It's the word of God revealed, made known, revealed. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You have to help me now. I've conducted probably a hundred weddings. I have found on occasion that the bridegroom and some of you sitting here possibly this morning when the bridegroom made his first approach to you as a young lady, you were actually scared of it. You were scared of him. You were scared of the commitment. You didn't want to have anything to do with it. and he went the other direction. Now, for a lot of you, it was love at first sight, of course, but for a lot of other people, it wasn't. When I first saw him, the message, I was afraid of him. I first begin to see, I was seeing there was something different in this ministry, the prophet's ministry. There was a part of it I loved. Oh, the blind girl healed in in in this place. Or telling the woman on the platform of the man dying with cancer up the road and I know the place and I know the woman and I know the town and I know all the other things. Oh, that's nothing to be afraid of there. But when it start to get, you know, that this is the this is a message and this is the Elijah which was for to come and this is the forerunning ministry and this will bring on the resurrection. This will bring on the rapture. those things began to be a little bit frightening because they're awesome. &gt;&gt; And when you really see it, it it is an awesome thing. &gt;&gt; You believe that? You regard that. But oh, as he made himself known, you fell in love. &gt;&gt; Oh, it became such a loving relationship. And then you said, "Will you marry this man?" Yes, I'll marry this man. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll become his wife. &gt;&gt; I'll give myself to him. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't just happen. You know, it's not a flash in the pan. It's not a Hollywood experience. This isn't a Hollywood romance. This isn't a true love story out of some filthy magazine. This is when the God that wrote this book makes himself known to you in the beauty of Jesus Christ, you fall in love with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've got to I've got to come to a close because I don't want to keep you long and so I'm going to bypass some. But when he when Jesus said you'll you will see me and and he's used this in a certain certain specific way and this has been my experience and so I want to pass it on to you. You will view attentively my precious friends who we've traveled with, journeyied with for a lot of years, many of you. This is not a Sunday go to meeting religion. This is something you hear and you leave this place and you view it attentively. You view it and maybe you don't see it. Say, I didn't understand what the preacher said. I didn't grasp everything Sunday morning. Last Sunday morning. Do I just forget? Say, "Oh, I didn't understand that. I wasn't able to follow it. Sometimes I miss some words because I'm sitting behind. I don't have the same advantage you do." No, I'm not going to give up on that. I I want to hear what the spirit said to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you that have heard it heard it again. What a joy it is. &gt;&gt; How beautiful it is. &gt;&gt; And so it is to view it attentively, to perceive with the eyes, to see in this context, you will see me. That word is so magnificent because it is also to enjoy the presence of one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll see me. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He's saying I want you to enjoy the presence, my presence. That is his purpose. And listen friends, when God has a purpose in his mind, if you will connect with that same thought, if you will confess that same thing. There isn't anything in this world that can rob you of that. You maybe perhaps have not felt his presence. I want to announce to you today, you are eligible. to enjoy. &gt;&gt; Not just a service. You're eligible. Young men, young ladies, you're eligible. Mothers, fathers, and families. You are eligible to go out of this service tonight and say or this morning and say, "I am eligible. I've been announced this morning that I am eligible to enjoy, to revel in, to enjoy his presence. &gt;&gt; This is not an intellectual exercise. This is not just a lesson. This is not just a Sunday school lesson. This is something that has feeling to it. This is something that the greatest lover that's ever been is inviting you to enjoy his presence. And if this horse rider has robbed you of that, &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to be closing in a few moments, but I'm going to close with something that the lamb himself said. &gt;&gt; And the lamb has imposed a certain restriction upon the horse rider of this age. He's imposed a restriction. In fact, this I'll go ahead and tell it because I'm here anyway. The Bible says and there was a the the the beast the living creature said that was that anointing that living creature he said come and see that was the invitation move the intent of God who commissioned him said take him from this place and to this place and to open their eyes but then &gt;&gt; John heard a voice &gt;&gt; from in the midst of the four living creatures and if you read in Revelation the 3r chapter I believe it is you'll find that that voice that he turned to see the fourth chapter fifth chapter he turned to see the lion and when he turned listen to me now because the positioning is important he turned to see the lion that had loosed the seals and he said he saw a lamb &gt;&gt; and he gives the position of the lamb in the midst of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders right in the center was the lamb And when he get over to this to this seal opening, the third seal, and the voice comes out from the living creature, come and see. But John hears another voice. He hasn't heard it in the other seals, but he hears another voice out from the midst of the four living creatures. Who is the lamb himself speaking? And the lamb says, "Hurt not &gt;&gt; the oil and the wine. Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot touch &gt;&gt; the spirit &gt;&gt; the portion of the spirit that I have allotted to my children and you cannot touch the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Touch not. &gt;&gt; God has imposed a law upon Satan himself. And I want to announce to you, my brothers, my sister, the portion of the spirit that God has allotted to you and the revelation that he's made regardless. You may say, "Oh, it's so small. It's so little." But isn't it wonderful? Satan cannot touch it. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? He cannot make it diminish. &gt;&gt; He cannot take any of it away. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I don't sense it. I don't feel it. I don't." That doesn't mean it's gone. You still have it. It's yours &gt;&gt; and he cannot take it. &gt;&gt; He cannot take it. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I'm not there." I say, "Move." &gt;&gt; Come from where you are. &gt;&gt; Come. &gt;&gt; Move. &gt;&gt; That was the intent of God. Don't stay where you're at. &gt;&gt; If you're bound or you're defeated, say it this morning. I'll be free. &gt;&gt; I accept my freedom. I receive that portion of the spirit that God has allotted to me and there's no devil in hell that can take it away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that portion that revelation &gt;&gt; might say, "Well, I don't have any great revelation." Do you know that God is one? &gt;&gt; Do you know that you're to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Millions out there know nothing about it. You have revelation &gt;&gt; and Satan cannot take that revelation from you. Nobody can take it from you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you want to rejoice over that. That's why I came up with the course. We are more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; In his name, we're more &gt;&gt; than victorious in his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Bless our sister. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is our inheritance in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God never intended that your inheritance should be depleted or diminished. In fact is when the children of Israel got in in Judges the first chapter and went in and you read it in the first chapter you'll find and and Benjamin failed to drive the this the Hittites out or the Jebusites out and all of the tribes failed to drive some of their people out of the valleys or out of the mountains or wherever more. And though they became a problem to them because they didn't inherit the whole thing, &gt;&gt; but the day come when they took it all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hurt not &gt;&gt; the oil &gt;&gt; and the wine. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says further, he may afflict the body. &gt;&gt; He doesn't put in these words. There's a portion that he can get at &gt;&gt; there is. He may destroy this body, &gt;&gt; our sisters physically, but she's supposed to die a long time ago &gt;&gt; and die before she even got the knowledge of the revelation of Jesus Christ. And here she stands today. Satan's afflicted her body, but he cannot take away. &gt;&gt; He cannot take away the oil and the wine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God may take this body. God may God may allow enemy to destroy us. And as he took Job and made him uh with boils from the top of his head to the soles of his feet, have you ever had a boil? He had them all over his body. And he was scraping it. What a dismal situation he was in. But there was one mandate. One mandate that was put upon Satan. You cannot take his life. You cannot destroy his life. And this horse rider that's rode into this generation. He may afflict you financially. He may afflict you uh uh physically. He may do all kinds of destructive work. There's one thing he cannot do. He cannot take the spirit &gt;&gt; and the revelation &gt;&gt; of God's word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's something that we get excited about. They get excited down the casino winning some winnings. They get excited at the horse race. They get excited over the football. They get excited over the puck. What's wrong with being excited about this? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm excited about it. Lord, &gt;&gt; it's one of the few places that we can just be ourselves. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Why don't you say what the lamb said? Hurt not &gt;&gt; the oil and the wine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hurt not &gt;&gt; the oil and the wine. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why don't we stand to our feet? &gt;&gt; Why do we give him glory? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Dilia. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; This blessed sister, Father. And what you've given to her, no man can take away. All the things that she has seen are glorious. &gt;&gt; And now her body, oh God, is in need of strength. Her body is in need of the virtue. Her body is in need of the work that was purchased for her at Calvary. Oh God, I pray you'll cast out the spirit of infirmity which has bound her and hindered her and let her from this day forth gain in her strength. Strengthen her ankle bones. Strengthen her feet, oh God. Strengthen her muscles, oh God. strengthen her in her faith, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ that you and you alone will be glorified. We just want to glorify you. We want to magnify you in the blessed name of Jesus. We glorify him. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. We praise him. And as a prophet of God said, just thank him. Praise him for it. Glory to God. He's done great things for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Never, never, never. &gt;&gt; The lamb has spoken. &gt;&gt; Heard not &gt;&gt; the oil and the wine. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We praise him. We praise him. We bless your name. We bless your name. We bless his name. We bless his name. Hallelujah. Give him thanks. Give him praise. Oh, bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Bring this atmosphere with you this evening. &gt;&gt; Who else is worthy of this praise? &gt;&gt; Who else is worthy? There's none like him. Glory. Glory. [Music] &gt;&gt; We name we bless his name. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We bless your name. We bless your name. Let's just sing it together. [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] I bless your name. I bless your name. &gt;&gt; Once again, I bless your name. &gt;&gt; I bless your name. I bless your name. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] I bless your name. I bless your name in prison. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] I [Music] midnight princess. Don't be [Applause] [Music] glory. [Music] [Music] Yeah. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. You are the truth. I [Music] bless your name. Hallelujah. [Music] There was a a great hero in the in Switzerland and they remember this man Arnold von Winkler [Music] and a great heroic need that history says that he did and there was a the oncoming uh armies against Switzerland coming from Austria and uh he ran apparently this is what they say he ran into the front lines of all of those swords that were drawn those spears and plunged them into himself. mouth and cried out to those that were behind him, save my wife and children. And he made a breach in the lines of the oncoming army and so that there was a great victory. Brother Brandon simply uses that thought and he says, "But oh brother, sister, that was such a little thing to one day when Adam's race was backed up against a wall. They had had prophets. They had had law. They had they had killed the prophets and they destroyed the laws. And Adam's race was backed up, helpless and hopeless against the oncoming enemy. I can tell you friends, if it had not been for a message in this hour, I've not seen a church. I've not seen a religion. I've not seen anyone have been able to withstand this rider that has ridden into this generation. &gt;&gt; He's writing &gt;&gt; today. He's writing. You're in church, but this enemy is riding. &gt;&gt; He's writing whatever power is is is that he can that he can utilize, &gt;&gt; any scheme he can devise. He's a lot smarter than you or I. &gt;&gt; I thank God that the very mind of Christ has come down and been made known to us. And I don't take these services lightly. I don't take lightly. I don't take the message lightly. And we would have been hopeless to the oncoming enemy. He said the devil and all of his hosts, welltrained spirit beings. The mortal was no match for them at all. And what could they do? They were helpless. Are you listening to me? But there was one who stepped out of glory from the bosoms of the father. And he said, "I'll go down this day and give my life for Adam's fallen race." And when he was here on earth, he found the darkest spot of the spears that conquered man. And it was death. And the last rider to ride on the pale horse is death. &gt;&gt; But our conqueror, &gt;&gt; he found that spot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he grabbed an armful of them at Calvary and plunged himself to death. The devil never took his life. &gt;&gt; Rome never took his life. The Jews never took his life. He took he gave his own life. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And he left the commission with his church, the little ragged group." And we're still a little ragged group, uneducated, illiterate fishermen. He never left with just, he said he never left with just sticks and stones to fight with. But on the day of Pentecost, he put the greatest weapon in the church's hands that it's ever had. And he said, "Follow me. &gt;&gt; Fight with all that's in you." And I say that come has come to my come to my heart. Follow me. &gt;&gt; He said, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; And one came down. How we heard last Sunday, Revelation 10 and one. And this mighty angel, that's him. &gt;&gt; He wasn't coming defeated. He didn't have to come and plunge more arrows or darts or spears into his body. He had already given it. But he was saying to saying to his church in this hour, he's saying to us in this hour, death is conquered and the time has come. What he purchased back there, he intends it to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he led the way. He was a mighty conqueror. He didn't conquer for himself and for his own glory, but he conquered for the good of Adam's fallen race. And there's been never never been a conqueror like that. I want to sing, I will praise him. I will praise him. And surely everybody here, we can bring the service to a close with that on our lips. I will praise him. Give him glory all ye people. You're not too weary for that, are you? Oh, give him all the praise and the glory. All of us together now would join in. I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the Lamb for sinners. Holy for his blood has &gt;&gt; just once more together. I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the S. For his blood has washed away. [Music] &gt;&gt; Our heads bowed. Oh God, our God, you love fatherhood &gt;&gt; and that's why you've brought us to yourself as your children. As I stand here, Lord, before these sons and daughters, those that you purchased at Calvary, Lord, to some perhaps you're saying, "Come." And for myself, I receive, oh God, the invitation that you'd have me move, Lord, into a higher height with you, God. God, how my soul yearns to see you even in more of your glory and your wondrous beauty in your word. Take this beloved precious body of people that are here and those that are elsewhere around the world at this moment. It's morning here and it may be evening and nighttime where others are listening. I pray oh God you'll embrace your children and let them feel those mighty arms undergurting them letting them know that they will face nothing in the coming days without your presence being there with them. Some will be in need of wisdom because they have to make a decision. Others are in need perhaps Lord financially or materially. I pray that you will supernaturally provide for them. Some may be in need physically. Oh God, come and do your mighty works that the name of Jesus Christ will be glorified. But above all things, Lord, even if some and at times perhaps our eyes get filmed over as it was with John the Baptist sending his servants and disciples and saying, "Go and ask him again, is it him or do we look for another?" And you sent them back with the confirmation, "No, it was you doing the same things. go and tell him what you see and hear. And I pray, Father, we will always remember what we've heard and what we say have seen. And Lord, I pray that you will make that a a quickened quickened to each one of us again. &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask your blessings upon the people as we depart. And now to return this afternoon, Lord, and we'll hear our brother John Andy's, oh God, with a word that you've laid upon his heart. I pray that you will make this a a blessed day. And Lord, I'd ask you to be with our brother Tony as he journeys. Pray that you'll go with him and give him a give him a an increased portion of wisdom. Lord, just give him, oh God, everything that is needed for decisions that need to be made. And I pray that you'll anoint him, Father, for service and for ministry. And Lord, as I also will be meeting him, I pray, oh God, you'll prepare the hearts of the people. And anoint, oh father, I pray us as your servants that we may that we may act and do according to your perfect will. In the name of Jesus Christ, dismiss us now we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. to greet one another and come back and have a good seat this evening and hear what God has for us. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Glory. [Music] Hallelujah. I Heat. Heat. [Music] you the water. So father we believe that this is the children's prayer. You are drawing from the benefits of that by your stripes for it wasn't in vain Lord that to the believer in its victory it's victory in the promise that you shall anoint the sick they shall recover to her sister inheritance in Christ. the Lord her and go from the house of God. We deny the devil. We resist him in Jesus name. And this time we believe for the glory of God. Now order your glory. Lord, you are the mighty Lord in faith conquer Satan. My dear sister leave the house until their friends free and hold in the name of Jesus. Bless her now and let her rejoice in Jesus name. Amen. Let her rejoice be now. Let rejoice. I am free. I deliver. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music]
