AMOS 3:7

I say this with all my heart that if any persons will take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise that God has made it'll bring it to pass if you could take the right attitude towards what he said it'll bring it to pass I've seen sarcom cancer lead people by that same thing now maybe you won't be able to receive enough for just to deliver you all of a sudden but I might say tonight this closing I want to talk to you a moment and say this if you can't receive enough Faith to be healed instantly then you take the adopted baby route did you ever hear of adopting a baby now if you take a young woman she'll maybe be married and and she and her husband and she's scared she isn't going to have a baby she wants one and she's so scared she won't have it she won't because just like job said the things that I feared the most come up call me but you take that same woman now there doctors which probably is sitting by nurses you take that same woman and let her adopt a baby then she'll have one herself see it quietens her now if you haven't got enough Faith to receive it right now as a miracle then take the adopted baby attitude Lord is mine because you promis that I'll go from here tonight praising you just the same as I was well watch what happen you'll receive it it has to happen God promised it so he's the infinite God and if you can feel just the least little speck of faith that tells you that you'll be all right you believe it just go on thanking him part
