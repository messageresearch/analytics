TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I trust in you [Music] that I see through this we [Music] will guide the unseen. [Music] I look back on history, seen a mighty God unveil. He's been proving for and that his word can never. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. [Music] Oh, Jesus. Oh, and he's living the same God. [Music] the same [Music] to the God who are in the rain with me. [Music] He's the same God. The same God [Music] and all the earth came back to Jesus. There is power. [Music] But now here is the day I see I begin to see [Music] the same [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Amazing. [Music] [Music] this morning. [Applause] [Music] Say God wondering [Music] the savior. Hallelujah. That's our declaration this morning, Lord. We believe that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. We're standing on that word, Lord. We're believing it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Number 188. Oh, what a friend. Oh, what a friend who was beside me [Music] to hold my hand [Music] and save me. [Music] He always [Music] goes away. &gt;&gt; He goes away. I know is he [Music] my [Music] My friend [Music] is to me. You know it. Just lift up your hand. [Music] He knows the way. I know. He my [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; real sweetly Now, oh what [Music] beside me hold my hand and safely guide me. [Music] You always [Music] he to me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You love him this morning &gt;&gt; with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Serving him with all your might. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many served him 50% this week? Just you've given him 50%. Praise God. 100% participation. How many have served him with all your heart, &gt;&gt; all your mind, all your soul, all your strength? If we were under the law, we'd all be miserable. We'd be failures. But his grace, oh, it's extended past where we could reach. He's done more for us, friends, &gt;&gt; than we can do for him. &gt;&gt; And he still loves us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got a number of prayer requests to read together this morning. Couple of specials. Our pastor is going to be coming and speaking this morning. I don't know his title, but I know what my heart's crying for. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord knows what your heart's crying for this morning. That's exactly what he's going to speak. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Isn't that encouraging? A God that knows exactly &gt;&gt; what you need and your neighbor needs. &gt;&gt; The person across the aisle, the person behind you. &gt;&gt; We don't have to have a pitchfork religion. Oh, that's for them. Hope they caught it. Turn around to check. We don't have to live like that. &gt;&gt; How many people know somebody that's not a believer that's miserable? I mean, seriously, searching. They go to church, &gt;&gt; searching, troubled, &gt;&gt; scared, &gt;&gt; bewildered. Why is fill in the blank? This happening, that happening. Why isn't my church doing this? Why isn't my church doing that? And you say, "God, open their eyes." We have the tree of life literally in our presence. [Music] &gt;&gt; But you can't make them eat any more than I can make them eat. But you just say, "Lord, let my light so shine &gt;&gt; in this dark age that people would want to be where you're sitting." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Brother Ernie, just ask you to come and pray after I read these requests. Brother Murphy has a request for a sister in Shenzhen, China. She asked the church to pray for a mom who had stomach cancer now spread to her spine. She believes the Lord can heal her through the prayer of the saints. Amen. So, we want to remember that need this morning. Brother Tom Frey asked that we remember his dad in prayer. He is in a condition which which affects his ability to swallow, speak, and breathe as well. He is not saved. He is almost 83 years old. I told him that we would be praying and I'm asking God to save him and to show himself in this condition by touching him physically as well. Amen. Brother Tom, we can agree and pray with you this morning. Uh, Sister Violet Laws has an unspoken request that she would like us to pray over as well this morning. Brother Richard Drake asked us to pray for John Drake. He fell last Wednesday and has hurt his neck. While doctors were investigating that injury, they discovered a growth at the top of his neck by the skull and they feel it is not cancerous but it is uh placing a lot of pressure on the nerves and he is in a lot of pain. Brother John is believing for total healing. Amen. We can as well. [Music] Uh this is from sister Victoria Adamora. uh she wants to mention the passing away of her mother who will be uh buried in May on May the 2nd. Thank you for your continued prayers. Though in sorrow, the joy of the Lord has been my lasting strength and will continue to be. Thank you for all the words of comfort, the support, the empathy received from many. I may not know how to physically express my gratitude. However, you are all wonderful and have shown the love of Jesus Christ to mourn with those that mourn and rejoice with those that rejoice in every little way. That means so much to me. Thank you so much and God bless you each and everyone. Amen. God bless you, Sister Victoria. Amen. If you have an unspoken need upon your heart this morning, maybe you just want to slip your hand up to the Lord and say, "Lord, I didn't write it down, but you know what's written on the tablets of my heart. If the deacons can come as well this morning, ask brother Ernie to pray over the offering. Amen. God bless you, brother Ernie. God bless your saints. Like to just give a quick testimony. My mom has uh has battled cancer for several years and just recently they found a little spot on her lung and she had to go through a series of chemo treatments and her birthday was on March the 29th. And when I called her, she told me and I knew something was different in her voice because I had spoken to her about four days ago and she wasn't real bright and wasn't real uh, you know, real on top of things. But when I called her on her birthday, she told me that the doctor had put her on a new medication and her testimony was, "I'm 85, but I feel like I'm 55." So, uh, I'm so thankful for that and I know many saints have have prayed and I appreciate so much the the the supernatural touch that God has given to her. So, let's pray. Father, to say that we are a blessed people would be the greatest understatement that a man could ever speak. Truly Lord, you have known us before the foundation of the world and predestinated us to be here at this time at the closing seconds of time. Father, as we see world events rapidly taking place, we see prophecies that Jesus spoke. We see them coming into manifestation quickly. We see prophecies that our prophet spoke about Russia and and about all the things that are taking place in the world. We see everything just lining up so perfectly, Father. And we want to line up perfectly with your word. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are we are in the midst of a of a spiritual evolution that has brought about a revolution. And this inspiration that's come from this revelation, Father, is lifting us up into realms and spheres and domains that we've never known before. Lord, how thrilled we are when we read your word and to know that we are a part of that word and that you have a plan for us throughout all of eternity, Lord. That throughout all of eternity, we'll never be bored. We'll be continually learning about your your wonders and your glory. And Lord, now we want to turn to the prayer requests that were pinned down first of all for this sister in China that brother Murphy has spoken about. And Lord, how many times have we heard a prophet has spoken cancer out of existence, that demon that has afflicted a person? And how many times through throughout our own experience have we heard how God has moved upon this scene, even in my own mother's life? Father, we just pray that you would move upon that sister's life. God, pray that faith would rise up in her life that she would be able to claim every one of the redemptive blessings of the resurrection. Lord, we pray for Sister Victoria Adamore, Lord, at the passing of her mom. We pray that you would give her a supernatural touch, Lord. Pray that you would give her a peace that passes all understanding and a peace that comes even in the midst of a storm, Lord. And we're so thankful that we don't sorrow as others sorrow, Lord. For we know and we have a promise that we're going to see our loved ones that are redeemed on the other side. Lord, we pray for this unspoken prayer request for Sister Violet Laws. Pray that whatever it is that you would accomplish it for her and do it quickly. Lord, our precious sister has been so faithful. Lord, bless her, I pray. And Lord, we also pray for for brother John Drake. Lord, what a blessing that that he and his family were to me when I first came to Cloverdale. I just pray that that you would be able to have the doctors quickly discern with supernatural wisdom the direction that they would go in his treatment. I pray that you would raise them up, God. Take the take the pain away. take whatever is is going on in this body and Lord, I pray that you would just move it away. Give him strength, Father, to overcome this challenge. And Lord, we are just so in anticipation and expectation of what you're going to do in the midst of of us today. Lord, we pray for our pastor as he comes to bring the word. Bless him, God. inspire him. Lift him up into that channel, Lord, that you would have him to be. Let Let each one of us, Lord, take our lick of fire and let it shine, Lord. Let it shine brightly. Let us pull from that word. Every bit that you have for us, every bit of revelation, Father, let us soak it up. Let us absorb it, Lord. Let us internalize it and metabolize it. Father, that we may raise up into that super church that you said that we would be. Lord, we ask all these blessings for we've asked them in your precious and holy name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you have your seats? The deacons receive the offering this morning. We want to welcome each and everyone that's here with us this morning. Those on the telephone internet and on the on the telephone hookup and on the internet, we certainly want to greet you as well. Why don't we sing uh victory in Jesus number 777 as they're taking up the offering. If you're visiting here with us, uh who's visiting this morning? Maybe you can just lift up your hand. Got a visitor over here. God bless you this morning. Amen. Why don't we give him a warm welcome? Praise God. Amen. If you're not visiting here with us, just trust that you enjoy the service this morning. Amen. We've got a special I think Sister Brianna Dingwall is going to sing for us and then just after she's done singing, Brother Ryan and Andrew and Brother Daniel right here. You're going to come up and sing for us. So, we'll just uh try and get the specials in this morning. You've been singing really good, but we'll enjoy a couple specials, too. All right. Praise the Lord. Why don't we sing the first verse? I heard an old story how glory on the rest I [Music] see the victory. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] and all to him to [Music] the Imus. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] and our [Music] victory. [Music] [Music] As you sing with angels near, Do you know that he is here? Will you turn him away unnoticed? Will you close your heart in coldness? What is it that has brought us together? My friend, this could be the only day you have left to lift your voice in praise to tell him all he means to you. So reach out your hands to Jesus. Don't let him pass you by. Reach your voice and praise him. Halleluah. Don't let him leave unwelcomed with dirty feet once more. Praise his name. Constrain him to stay while you're here in the presence of the Lord. And like our brothers headed to Emmas, [Music] when he made to go on, they constrain him to stay. And like our sister, he was dirty and unwelcomed. Fell down and worshiped. and you washed my Savior's feet. So my friend, just let go of your flesh. God wants a sacrifice of praise. Won't you worship and adore him today? So reach out your hands to Jesus. Don't let him pass you by. Lift up your voice and praise him. Halleluah. Don't let him leave unwelcome with dirty feet once more. Praise his name. Constrain him to stay while you're here in the presence of the Lord. Soon there will come a day every knee will bow, every tongue will stay. While you are here today, don't take this moment for granted to reach out your hands to Jesus. Don't let him pass you by. Lift up your voice and praise him. Halleluah. Don't let him leave unwelcome with dirty feet once more. Praise his name. Constrain him to stay while you're here in the presence of the Lord. Reach out your hands to Jesus. Don't let him pass you by. Lift up your voice and praise him. Halleluah. Don't let him leave unwelcome with dirty feet once more. Praise his name. Constrain him to stay while you're here in his presence. Praise his name. constrain him to stay while you're here in the presence of the Lord. [Music] [Applause] Brother Daniel and those are coming and the children are coming in. Why don't we sing together? Touching Jesus is all that really matters. You remember brother Tom in your prayers this week. He's ministering down at brother Jason Jackson's in Hardy, Arkansas. Brother Kyle's ministering from Victoria today. Brother John, I believe, is taking the service down in Seattle tonight. Brother Tim will be ministering here. Amen. We just want a wonderful time in God's presence. Amen. Touching Jesus is all that matters. And your life will never be the same. And there's only one way to touch him. and just believe [Music] his name. Jesus is all that we [Music] [Applause] only touch. That's just where you are. What is his name? [Music] [Music] I see again the sun rising up, darkness disappearing. The skies are shining. It's another day, [Music] another year. [Music] It's time to remember your goodness to me. for your wondrous Lord, your mercy and grace. There is nothing I can give to you in return. But I give my life as a sacriice. [Music] This is my offering. I lay it down. Would you consume me and take all I am. This is my offering. I lay down. You hold my days. You know the future. And Lord, all I should do is trust in you. In my weakness, Lord, I need your strength. Would you show me the way and I will follow? Cuz I give my life as a sacriice. This is my offering. I lay down. Would you consume me [Applause] [Music] and take all I am? This is my offering. I lay down. I give my life as a sacriice. This is my offering. I lay down. [Music] Would you consume me and take all I am? This is my offering. I lay down. Draw me closer to you. [Music] Show me closer to you. [Music] I bring my life before you. That's all I have to offer. I want to live for you. I want to live just for you. My sins are live on the altar. worship me to be more like you. I want to live for you. I want to live just for you. I bring my life before you. That's all I have to do. I want to live for you. I want to live just for you. My sins I live on the altar. Shape me to be more like you. I want to live for you. Oh, I want to live closer [Music] to you. [Music] Draw me closeer to you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we invite our pastor to come this morning, why don't we stand together? I love you, Lord, and I lift my voice. Thank you for that special, Brother Daniel. He sings good on his birthday, doesn't he? He sings good every other day of the year, but today just happens to be his birthday. I bless you, Brother Daniel. I love you and I give my voice to worship you. Oh my souljord [Music] smile upon us this morning Lord you hear a sweet sweet sound in I love you, Lord. I love you. And I [Music] worship you all my soul. Take my king. [Music] Let me sweet. &gt;&gt; How I love you, Lord. I love you. [Music] I [Music] still worship you. Oh my soul [Music] I [Music] let it be a sweet [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; He is indeed. So nice to see you all here this morning. And I'm sure that you are here not just to uh attend a service but to be part of a service &gt;&gt; to participate, be a part of it. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be having much of a service. &gt;&gt; So I want to thank you for coming. Thank you for your prayers and would ask you to be an expectation. Uh I looking for my grandson Nathan and his wife Crystal are here and I'm so happy &gt;&gt; to have them. &gt;&gt; God bless you. So thankfully you came, brother Nathan, Christelle and their little one. And it's amazing really. I got uh I got a very long email from for the first time for very many many many years from my nephew, my sister Sharon who lives on Vancouver Island from her son. He's a teacher. He's actually vice principal in a school in South Korea and uh I got a long email from him this morning and he was addressing the time he lived with us. He lived he and his brother Michael they lived with us for a year in the early days of Bible way and uh so he was just addressing a couple things. I haven't read it thoroughly, but he was uh I I think that they want to promote him up to principal and wanted, you know, so he was giving his background in history. And he said, I I referred to I'm sending it to you because I referred to the time we lived with you. And while I don't adhere or follow to those things, but yet he remained very uh very religious in that he even uh sought to become a a priest in one of the denominational churches and that never happened. and he went into the into the education and uh somehow I gathered that he felt we were anti-education and uh I I thought my if he were here today he would certainly he he perceived he said I was 12 years old at that time but he said I I was very impressed he's writing this for other people he said I was very very impressed he said there was amongst that group There was a person that was very very ill and they had to have emergency uh surgery within I think he said 6 days and the in the person came and and the elders prayed for her and she went back to the doctor and it wasn't there anymore. &gt;&gt; And so he said I was very impressed with that. I guess I would be too. I'm still impressed. &gt;&gt; I'm still impressed with the living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you impressed? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. While I was in the middle of my studies uh yesterday, I just want to make reference to brother Vio and Sister Marlin. see them sitting here because I just in the middle of my studies and sometimes things happen that are from another realm and I'll be speaking about that and uh and the presence of God just came came surrounded me and I I was seeing things in the word and I thought and and bringing it all present to the very present moment and uh and it was just like all my mind is just pregnantated did everything at once and says, "Vio and Marlin need to hear this." And and that was so direct. I reached for my phone without even knowing what I was doing. I reached for my phone and text brother Vio and he text me back and I'm just happy that you're here, Brother Vio. I don't know. It might just be a phrase. I don't know what it is. I would ask that the congregation very reverent if you would and please have as little movement as possible. Would you do that? &gt;&gt; Now we'll pray together. We're done with the singing. Thank you. Our gracious and loving and caring heavenly father. When I think of your prophet and the pillar of fire and visitation in that ministry, &gt;&gt; he referred to it sometimes as a gift. He referred to himself as a servant of God, other times a prophet of God. And we know that he was the prophet messenger that you sent because scriptures have been fulfilled. And we are in an incredible moment in our time, Lord. And I pray that we will not miss what's happening. Uh let us not be uh slow. Oh God, let us not be as those on the way to Emmas. Oh God, but yet let us be like them in that you stayed with them. You stayed with them. You were so insistent and persistent that you're going to bring them into the revelation of the secret of the tabernacle of God. So I pray that you will bless this congregation. We've come here, Lord, for a purpose. And I pray that you'll bless all that may be uh streaming this morning, Father, from whatever land and whoever may hear it later. I pray you'll bless them. &gt;&gt; Father, anoint me and let me be a servant of Christ for your people today. I pray, Father, that they in tune will be ready to receive from you, from another realm, from another place. In the name of Jesus Christ, we commit every soul into your care and into your keeping for your glory alone, Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to uh I want to speak to you on uh this subject, seasons of revelation. And uh I will read you can turn to Ecclesiastes the third chapter if you would please. Ecclesiastes is just immediately after Proverbs the third chapter. We'll read verses 1 down through 8. And then I'm going to read Genesis 1 and 14 the one verse. Now, just so that you can get a capsule of kind of where I want to go, I want to I will be making references to the season of the word becoming flesh, which was the son of man, Jesus Christ as the son of man in a prophetic ministry. And how that that season uh that the world began to be impacted by another world uh unseen world &gt;&gt; things were happening for the first time in history. Yes. &gt;&gt; Uh through the life of Jesus Christ as he revealed himself as a son of man. &gt;&gt; And uh and then the season of the indwelling Holy Spirit of God into a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A selected people and that became the season of the son of God. &gt;&gt; So we will begin to read please. To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven. A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted. A time to kill and a time to heal. A time to break down and a time to build up. A time to weep and a time to laugh. A time to mourn and a time to dance. A time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together. A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. A time to get and a time to lose. A time to keep and a time just a moment. A time to cast away. A time to rent and a time to sow. A time to keep sustenance and a time to speak. A time to love and a time to hate. a time of war and a time of peace. In Genesis 1 and14 says this and I have taken five items, five words or sentences, phrases out of this scripture. And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven." Two, number one, divide the day from the night. and then to let them be for signs and for seasons &gt;&gt; and for days &gt;&gt; and years. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. In natural life, we experience and are familiar with seasons. we have and I won't spend a lot of time on this but I'm just going to briefly there are seasons you know there are seasons of spring and summer and fall and we we experience those seasons Apostle Paul said and I'm moving very quickly through this Apostle Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man. I put away childish things. &gt;&gt; Uh he he wasn't saying I hated what I was when I was a child. No, that was all part of his life. &gt;&gt; But when I was a child, I spake as a child. I thought as a child, I did things as a child. When I became a man, I put away childish things. He was in a different season of life. That's right. &gt;&gt; They've had a lot of studies and I won't even begin to try to approach the subject of the season of childhood and then the season of adolescence because there's an awful lot said about from adolescence to adulthood &gt;&gt; and uh we could spend a whole lot of time on that and I think that today they seek to keep people within adolescence or in almost childhood mentally uh when they should be coming into adulthood. But they've done a lot of studies and there was a a professor of uh of psychology I believe it was and he interviewed 300 young people ages 18 to 29 in cities many cities uh across the United States I think largely or maybe throughout the world I do not know but he was asking them questions about what they wanted out of life in this study. And despite the differences of their backgrounds, this gentleman's name was Arnett, he was struck by the similar answers he heard from his young respondents. They shared a perception of feeling. They all they shared a perception of feeling in between. they're in between something knowing that they were pulling clear of the struggles of adolescence and starting to feel responsible for themselves but still closely tied to their parents and family. And so this presented them with a struggle that like I'm in between. I'm I feel for my family. I feel close to my family. I have a love for, you know, mother, father, whatever more. and and yet I've got to reach out here and and start paddling my own canoe. And uh they also reported pondering their personal identity. Arnet proposed a new period of lifespan development he calls and he coined the phrase emerging adulthood. and he coined that term in his book and his book is entitled Emerging Adulthood and I guess he refers to the winding road from the late teens through the 20s. So you can see men of stature and men of welleducated and men who teach others. They're always trying to understand and and figure out a better way. And uh and because it's very very important. We've got a lot of uh youth and young people here. We have we have those that are children. We have those that are adolesccents. We have those that are young men, young ladies, uh, reaching out and and finding their own way. &gt;&gt; And God has a way. God has a plan &gt;&gt; for everyone who commits their life to God. But you must understand also that the world is opposed to that pathway and that direction. And so there's come all kinds a myriad of distractions and things to uh draw a person aside. We all experience the unexpected. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; all of us do. &gt;&gt; We experience the unexpected. The passage of life from the season of adolescence to adulthood cannot be defined or placed into any specific order because we're all uh on on this journey together. And yet we're very very much individuals and our life and background and future is all unique to ourselves &gt;&gt; as individuals and yet we share a lot of things in common &gt;&gt; and spiritually we certainly do because it's the body of Christ &gt;&gt; but the season of childhood of adolescence and adulthood does indeed come to each one of us. I'm staying fairly close to my notes because I just I want to uh desperately can have continuity so you can follow with me. Brother Brandham refers to the season of immortal life and I would like to I'd like to just jump way way forward and bring something that I think is very striking that I've pondered for a lot of time a lot of years. You've heard me refer to the last four messages of brother Brandham. I don't think it's just last four messages. &gt;&gt; I believe because he was an instrument and a tabernacle through which God was going to speak certain things that he had never said before &gt;&gt; and would not repeat again. &gt;&gt; And he's not going to send another messenger to say, "I want to remind you about this." In other words, you have heard it &gt;&gt; and we need and and one of the things that really is uh striking to me is that the disciples and the people of the scripture, even when God was tabernacled, the fullness of the Godhead bodily in Jesus Christ, they were missing it. Yes. &gt;&gt; And you have to say, how do educated people, how do leaders, how do people who spiritually spend their entire life studying the Torah or the Bible of that day? How do they miss this? &gt;&gt; How come it doesn't come through? &gt;&gt; How come something doesn't grip them? Or maybe does it grip them and there's too much distraction or too much uh they're consumed too much with this world &gt;&gt; to fail to catch that world. &gt;&gt; And so he talks about this in the testimony of a true witness. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I let me just go back a step. I was just saying that the last four messages and when when the prophet of God now comes with in December the 4th 65 and he speaks the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he says things in there he never said before. He talks about the order of the rapture, &gt;&gt; the great order, &gt;&gt; the shout &gt;&gt; and the voice &gt;&gt; and the trumpet. &gt;&gt; And then he says this message that is the shout &gt;&gt; and he was just finalizing the shout. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe uh six or eight more hours &gt;&gt; and then those lips are going to be sealed forever. &gt;&gt; No man's going to hear them again like that. And then to have that vessel speaking and saying, "That's not me speaking. That's my voice, but that's not me speaking." &gt;&gt; And to have him say, "Uh, now I'm repeating this not to preach. I'm here to testify to you that I have been profoundly affected by these words and phrases &gt;&gt; uh standing in front of a person uh than to demonstrate Jesus Christ exactly as he did on earth &gt;&gt; or to demonstrate the one who met Abraham in chapter 18 of Genesis and turned his back and spoke of his wife Sarah knew her name and and said that I will surely return unto you according to the time of life and Sarah thy wife shall have a son and that one and he said and and then to have a vessel standing here in front of us in our age and say I'll turn my back &gt;&gt; what what's happening friends what is that &gt;&gt; you know the this world is going to be held responsible for that act &gt;&gt; and to say what were you thinking when that was happening &gt;&gt; who did you think that was &gt;&gt; and now he chooses a scripture he chooses scripture for the rapture message which happens to be uh Psalms 27. It's a strange scripture but the last verse of his scripture reading was verse 5. For in the time of trouble &gt;&gt; he shall hide me in his pavilion. &gt;&gt; And if there ever was a people or a time of trouble, &gt;&gt; it's today. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you if you don't have him to to be hidden in the secret of his pavilion or in the secret of his tabernacle, in the secret, the next phrase is in the secret of his tabernacle. And the scripture says God was in Christ. &gt;&gt; That was the secret. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why this messenger had to say Christ &gt;&gt; is the mystery of God &gt;&gt; revealed &gt;&gt; seasons of his revealing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was in Christ &gt;&gt; and those that caught that secret &gt;&gt; were protected. &gt;&gt; Amen. They are the ones who made it through the time when Jesus was here. &gt;&gt; Then that spirit came into them on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; And at the end of this at the end of the days of grace, or I would say I won't say the end of the days of grace, but during this 2,000 years of the gospel, &gt;&gt; then comes a a vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will say plainly, a tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Amen. that God could exercise himself and demonstrate himself as a God, a a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the God prophet &gt;&gt; and they missed that. &gt;&gt; And now we have a prophet of God and they missed that. &gt;&gt; But he came for a div defined purpose. &gt;&gt; When Jesus Christ was here, he had a divine purpose to call out a certain number. And in John 17 in his prayer he says that those that were yours you have given them to me &gt;&gt; and I have lost none of them save the son of predition which was Judas. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And so, brother Brandham says in this testimony of a true witness, but the life that was in the leaf talks about nature now goes back where it come from down through the tree to the root. And there it remains in the root of the tree until another season. &gt;&gt; There the root of David. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This world has never been able to destroy that life. &gt;&gt; They're at the root of David. &gt;&gt; The life simply goes back down to the root &gt;&gt; for another season. Waiting for another season &gt;&gt; and then it erupts again. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; And to have that revealed is the secret of his tabernacle. &gt;&gt; He may change his tabernacle, but it's the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is why the apostle Paul can come out this great mystery. Christ &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; What about that one? &gt;&gt; Are we missing that one? &gt;&gt; Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, oh yeah, but I, you know, they're this and they're that and there's something else." But the blood washed &gt;&gt; body of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; has been indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God. And in that secret is your protection &gt;&gt; today. And that's the only protection there is &gt;&gt; until another season. For this season, for this season, the sun has rocked away and the earth has rocked away from the sun and it's following the orbit as it goes around and it's away and cold weather is headed for the earth. Therefore, the root holds the life of that leaf until the earth rocks back again. And then there is no way to ever hide that leaf from coming back again. It'll come back just as sure as the sun comes back. &gt;&gt; And I'll say it is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; The sun has come out again. And that and that messenger that came at this time was sent for one reason to tell the people the sun has risen again. &gt;&gt; And don't miss the sun rising. Don't miss it. It's another day. &gt;&gt; Another season of revelation. &gt;&gt; And there's no way to keep the leaf from coming back. just as sure as it sun comes back, it'll come back. But it has to wait for another season before it comes back. &gt;&gt; And I want to say, and I put in bold letters, that season, friends, &gt;&gt; has arrived. &gt;&gt; You may wonder, you may say, well, oh, the revival amongst the young people, whatever more, it's just another season. &gt;&gt; And the secret of God is in the revelation of that season. And it's up to us to say what's happening. &gt;&gt; It's not up to us to say I got to be to work tomorrow morning, 8:00, 7:00, or got to get up at 6:00. That's all fine. That's not the season. That that's the season of mortal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And today that gives a great testimony as a witness of God, the God of creation, because that when we are in the season of mortal life, &gt;&gt; that's raising children, &gt;&gt; marrying and bringing forth families, &gt;&gt; this is a life or the season of mortal life. &gt;&gt; We've all experienced that and we're well acquainted with the seasons &gt;&gt; that we have in mortal life. And we have the whole gamut here today. We have those that are single, those that are unmarried, those that are without families, those that have families, we've had children, we've raised the children, and we've gone through our teens and all of these various things. We've experienced all these seasons, and now you have maybe empty nesters, and we're all getting adjusted to these things. Some have gone into retirement and it's all an adjustment. One thing and another. We're always adjusting because the target is moving. Life is moving. But let me tell you something. There is no satisfaction in mortal life without him. &gt;&gt; I don't care what little you have or how much you have. There's no satisfaction. our fulfillment and the secret of his tabernacle is our only place of fulfillment and satisfaction and safety. &gt;&gt; And we make our way through life the best we can, make our best decisions that we can and do what we need to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; But when we have been born from above, the body returns to the dust from where it came &gt;&gt; and the spirit goes up to where it come from, to the God who gave it. And there will come, listen, this isn't just a man's voice. And there will come another season. &gt;&gt; And that season that will come will be the immortal season. I believe brother Vio was about here and I just got swallowed up into the presence of the one that was speaking there this thing. There will be another season &gt;&gt; and I believe we have entered into that season. That's what I planned by God's help to come to in this service. And when the son of God rises with healing in his wings, that's why the ministry started with a healing in his wings &gt;&gt; and healing ministry. &gt;&gt; It'll be totally impossible to hold those bodies in the ground any longer. &gt;&gt; They'll come forth in the brightness of the son of God. Very nature itself testifies of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, there were seasons. There were seasons of many seasons, but there were seasons of seven fast, seven feasts. &gt;&gt; And the Bible talks about it. These are the feasts of the Lord, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their seasons. &gt;&gt; When these times come, you speak of it. Yes. &gt;&gt; When these times come, you proclaim it. You declare it. &gt;&gt; Don't you think that God when he's changing season, I'm going to change where I'm going to tabernacle. I'm going to change where I take my people. I'm going to bring them to a change of the body. Don't you think he would send a remarkable witness that this is the season? &gt;&gt; You're not just going to church, friends. You're not just having a picnic. &gt;&gt; You're not just having camp. That has nothing to do with it. I won't say has nothing to do with it. That's only a little part of it. &gt;&gt; But it is your individual life with this living one, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This one, the sun has rocked back &gt;&gt; close to the earth. This earth, &gt;&gt; this earth &gt;&gt; to bring out the life, &gt;&gt; the true life. And that's why you lose the interest in this world. &gt;&gt; You have adjustments in this world. You don't even know why you may things that were just you were so focused on them. You just had to go in a certain direction and suddenly something happens. It's a pull from within. The sun has rocked back close. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I had it. &gt;&gt; I wasn't preaching every Sunday. There was a time I was working. I won't even get into it. It's unimportant. When I was vice president, they said, "You're going to be president. We've named you as president. You're going to have a handsome increase in salary already." Already. I had almost a disdain for anything to do with that &gt;&gt; and I I I resigned. &gt;&gt; I resigned. I say I wasn't a professional man. That was I needed that. He said, "What are you going to do with your family? I don't know what's going to happen to the family." I wasn't too sure, but I knew I had to take a step. &gt;&gt; That was the step I took. And these seven feasts, they all spoke of Christ. Every one of them. There was the feast of Passover, feast of unleavened bread, feast of the first fruits of the resurrection, the feast of Pentecost, the feast of trumpets. Prophet said is the calling of the Jews to bring them to their day of atonement because the next feast was the atonement and the next feast was tabernacles. &gt;&gt; The feast of tabernacles that's the last feast in the Old Testament. And that's the feast every believer comes to &gt;&gt; change this tabernacle &gt;&gt; from mortal from the season of mortal. to the season of immortal. &gt;&gt; If we miss that, we've missed everything. &gt;&gt; I don't care what we achieve here on earth. If we miss that. So, I'll say to this congregation and all and I feel so not merely inspired, but I feel responsible to say, don't miss this. &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Even if you go away from here saying, "Well, how?" Well, that's good. and put yourself in a place say, "Oh, God, I I I didn't understand everything I heard this morning, but don't let me miss that. &gt;&gt; Don't let me miss what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Don't let me miss what you're revealing at this time. this season. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and the seasons in the scripture are, you're listening, young people, the seasons in the scripture are an appointed place. You know, maybe this morning you got up and thought, I'm going to go to church. Perhaps I can change that just a wee bit. It might well be that this is an appointment God called you to. &gt;&gt; And in the mind of God, he may be saying, "You calling you by name." It's absolutely urgent that you hear this. &gt;&gt; I have called you here. &gt;&gt; And if we put it in that context, you'll feel different about where you're sitting. That's right. &gt;&gt; You mean I have been called here? I I thought I just came to church. I thought I heard, you know, brother so and so speak. But why don't you put it in another context that God Almighty called you here? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, it's time for you to be real serious about this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we've entered another season. It could be an appointed time, a meeting, an appointed sign. I'm going to talk about a sign, a sacred season. It could be a set feast or the tent of meeting, seasons of revelation. Jesus said, "All things are delivered unto me of my father, and no man knoweth the son but the father." Right? &gt;&gt; Do we hear that? &gt;&gt; No man knoweth the Son, &gt;&gt; but the That was the problem. &gt;&gt; For those that didn't believe, no man knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. &gt;&gt; There is no other way. &gt;&gt; This isn't just a series of other doctrines. This is the son himself. But if people within the message fail to say the son, who's going to do the revealing? &gt;&gt; The son is the logos. The son is the word of God revealed. The son is God himself taking his word, making his thought known and saying and with declaring and proclaiming this is me. &gt;&gt; This is another spiritual feast. This is a season of another spiritual feast. [Music] to reveal. I'm going to make some statements now. Knowledge is not revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A revelation may bring you knowledge, &gt;&gt; but gaining knowledge is not a revelation. putting a series of statements together that connect to and come out with a final wonderful conclusion. That's not revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Revelation is not you finally coming into a church and hearing a preacher say something that say, you know what, that makes a lot of sense. That's not revelation. Right? &gt;&gt; Revelation is not something making a lot of sense. &gt;&gt; In fact, revelation may make no sense at all. &gt;&gt; It might well be that you'd say, "Why in the world am I believing this, &gt;&gt; but somehow revelation, you can't let go of it. &gt;&gt; Even if you wanted to, you can't let go of it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation is not just agreeing with a group of people and being one of the community. &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation is something that is and I don't expect that you will understand everything I'm trying to say because I don't understand it fully myself and I'm not ashamed to admit that something I pondered for a very long time. But to reveal or to be revealed is to uncover essentially uncover something. &gt;&gt; Amen. to lay open what has been veiled &gt;&gt; or covered. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Or to make it known or to make it clear, making it manifest, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Or to disclose what has previously been unknown. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's something that's revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And revelation I won't bother getting into the Greek words apocalyppsis but revelation is is to be revealed very similar manifestation but revelation also can be coming a coming &gt;&gt; the revelation of Jesus Christ can be the coming of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and he can come in degrees. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. He came as a baby. &gt;&gt; When he was conceived in the womb of a virgin, he was coming. &gt;&gt; Who knew it? Mary &gt;&gt; and perhaps Joseph. &gt;&gt; What's it going to be like? What's it going to do? They didn't know anything. But he was coming. &gt;&gt; And if someone had got up and declared, you know, I have God spoke to me. The Messiah is coming. He wouldn't persuade very many people. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't have a nice congregation as we have &gt;&gt; this morning. &gt;&gt; And then the babe was born and the shepherds come and the prophet speaks in this day. Why was the shepherds &gt;&gt; still has to be shepherds? &gt;&gt; Perhaps unlearned men. &gt;&gt; Yes. But they they had heard said, "We've heard angels. &gt;&gt; We heard an angelic host. &gt;&gt; Uh you fellas have never persuaded anybody. &gt;&gt; You've never moved. You've never led a political party. You've never uh been a success in business. &gt;&gt; Go and mind your sheep." &gt;&gt; Jesus came in simplicity. &gt;&gt; But he was coming. And then when he was 12 or thereabouts, he's in the temple asking questions and answering questions. It was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But to say that he was there on earth, who is going to believe it? &gt;&gt; But that was the secret of God's tabernacle. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'll soon be coming to the point where he walked and saw some fishermen. And don't put it back there because that one &gt;&gt; who walked there and called those young men &gt;&gt; is here this morning still calling young men and young ladies &gt;&gt; and parents &gt;&gt; and seniors. &gt;&gt; It's the same fire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I was so moved as a prophet of God had a woman standing in front of him and he said, "Can't you see that pillar of fire that's on the picture?" He said, "Now it hangs between I and the woman and I'm speaking to her through that fire." &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to her through that light. Is what he said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't recall these words before, but I was saying and I want you to be able to say, "Oh God, what is it that you declared in this ministry that has called me? This word that has called me. This thing that has become more real to me than even my friends or my parents or or my children. And it's more real to me." as I have her heard a sister say to me on the phone in fact it's sister Ellaner Drake said this is my family &gt;&gt; tell you what friends &gt;&gt; to say that in truth is a real not only a reality that's a revelation itself &gt;&gt; this is family Revelation should not be confused with a host of other things &gt;&gt; that we all experience and come in contact with and our other experiences. Revelation will produce a multitude of feelings. Revelation will produce &gt;&gt; a multitude of feelings. &gt;&gt; You may cry. You may rejoice. &gt;&gt; You may scream. &gt;&gt; You may shout. You may clap your hands. Those things are all wonderful. They're not necessarily revelation within themselves. &gt;&gt; But they may well be a result &gt;&gt; of revelation. They're not necessarily the evidence of revelation. For a lot of people, they clap their hands at the hockey game. &gt;&gt; They throw their hats in the air at the baseball game. &gt;&gt; They shout and become so enthused and inspired. I mean, they even entered into fighting over their favorite. What is it? &gt;&gt; It's certainly a cheap substitute. &gt;&gt; But revelation may cause a person to do some fanatical things. may cause people to turn aside from or they might cause a person to give themselves to a certain profession because God knows on down the road they're going to be used or they're going to meet somebody. &gt;&gt; Studies and teaching and gaining wisdom may result from revelation but they in themselves are not revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the future home, brother Brandham was talking about the little woman at the well and the and the priests. And he said, "Now here it was in this little woman. She was one of his attributes. &gt;&gt; Life had been very sad for her. She had gone through several marriages, five, &gt;&gt; and the man she was with was not her husband, &gt;&gt; and she wouldn't be a very good candidate for most churches, &gt;&gt; but she was a candidate for this one. &gt;&gt; And she says, "Now," he said, "Now there was a priest representing the light." representing the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen very close friends. I feel very very different about this service and I don't want you to walk out and say, "Well, I I I I enjoyed the service." That's I don't care whether you enjoy it or don't enjoy it. I trust that you'll get what God is wanting to &gt;&gt; do for you. &gt;&gt; And so he said, and I I know, do we have that slide? I believe we do. Slide three and four. That was it. We just just passed by. Here it was. Here it was in this little woman. She was one of his attributes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there was the priest representing the light. &gt;&gt; Notice please I have underlined he had learned &gt;&gt; he had learned it from the Bible. &gt;&gt; He had the right book. &gt;&gt; He had learned that God was God. &gt;&gt; He had learned that holiness was right. He was learned or learned that there was a law of God. He had learned it because of an intellectual conception. &gt;&gt; He mentally could grasp those things. &gt;&gt; God's God and maybe go through the studies perhaps had a preacher tell God's God. God's supernatural. He he learned those things. That's not revelation in itself. &gt;&gt; And he was born in the right lineage. &gt;&gt; I was born in a Christian family. I was born in a message family. I'm in the right lineage. He was a Levite. &gt;&gt; He was from the priesthood, but he only knew it by intellectual conception. He only knew it by intellectual conception. We're here behind the pulpit to get you beyond intellectual conception. &gt;&gt; Amen. to where the Holy Spirit comes in behind the preaching of the word and moves upon you until it becomes such a reality. &gt;&gt; Your life becomes a sacrifice to gues [Music] &gt;&gt; and he becomes the focal point and he's the only focal point. &gt;&gt; Listen to me young people, &gt;&gt; you that are of marriageable age and some that are going to be married. Marriage is not the end all. &gt;&gt; Finding the right man or the right woman is not the end all. That's only the beginning of of of another season in mortal life, &gt;&gt; in the mortal season. &gt;&gt; And you'll have your disappointments and you'll have your great times and you'll have your struggles and all of these things. That all happens in mortal life &gt;&gt; because that's the season of mortal life. &gt;&gt; You might be povertystricken. You might be rich. You might be sick. You might be healthy. I don't know. &gt;&gt; I know one thing. You'll only make it through this mortal life &gt;&gt; if you have yourself if you have a a a I would say a true understanding or a true revelation. And I believe that the word understanding is not right because you can understand things intellectually but it has to be more than that. &gt;&gt; It must be more than that. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, what what more?" Well, is there something more for Yes, there is something more for us. &gt;&gt; Well, why do you say there's something more? Why am I not why am I not getting it? I'll tell you why there's something more is because we're in another season. &gt;&gt; I will declare to you today that the coming of the messenger prophet in this end time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And over 50 times he refers to very revealing people said, "Well, it's discernment. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a gift of discernment &gt;&gt; or or whatever." He even used the word discernment. Yes, &gt;&gt; that's you can have discernment without saying and your name is Mrs. Wolf. &gt;&gt; You have a tumor on your breast. &gt;&gt; It's on your left breast and you live at such and such an address. That isn't just discernment, friend. &gt;&gt; And that's not William Brandon speaking. That's his voice. &gt;&gt; But it's the son of man, Jesus Christ using that. &gt;&gt; And he referred to it and this is what he said over 50 times. Surely we shouldn't have to have it over 50 times. This is the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; The past resurrection which was a type of the first of this resurrection. It's a type of the resurrection. This is a sign friends in this cultured age in this electronic and digital age. This is a sign. You have received the sign of the resurrection. And don't ever forget it. &gt;&gt; As Tommy Osborne said, it will not be repeated again. &gt;&gt; You will not have another messenger. You're not going to have something come and move you into some spontaneous, incredible experience. You've had it. &gt;&gt; As Jesus said to his disciples, Elias has already come and you didn't know it. Isn't it incredible? &gt;&gt; So he learned it by what had happened. &gt;&gt; Doesn't take any brains to know what had happened. Just read history. &gt;&gt; Study whatever you want. That's what had happened. &gt;&gt; But not what was happening. And what was happening is God was tabernacled in flesh. &gt;&gt; That's what was happening. And that's what he was missing. &gt;&gt; And I will tell you in without any apology, God tabernacled himself in you &gt;&gt; that are filled with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; to a measure that he's called you to. And God was tabernacled in the prophet of God, &gt;&gt; one we call William Brandham. God was tabernacled in him to speak through him to tell people things they knew. That's why he said multitudes of times were strangers. Raise your hand if we're a stranger. &gt;&gt; And they all raised her hand. Some would say, "Well, I was in another meeting." Yes, you were in another meeting. And this morning I'm reading and he's saying he said but this talking to this person this woman and she said yes and yes and yes &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and yes &gt;&gt; and yes that is right &gt;&gt; all of those things &gt;&gt; and have a person on your mind. Yes. And you're troubled about him. Yes. And it's your husband. Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Who knows those things? What book did it come out of? &gt;&gt; Who has spoken? &gt;&gt; Who's called you? &gt;&gt; And may I suggest to you that one &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; who had that kind of knowledge &gt;&gt; still has that kind of knowledge about where you're sitting &gt;&gt; and that you need to sit in this service &gt;&gt; by appointment. [Applause] This is a tent of your meeting. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to pay a bit of attention to the clock. &gt;&gt; I want to identify with Peter. &gt;&gt; I want you to identify with Peter. We identify with various characters in the Bible, but I'd like you to identify with Peter in connection to the seasons of Revelation. And you'll be able to identify with him at various stages &gt;&gt; of his life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I want you to not only feel your ups and feel your downs, but I just want you to go with him. We won't show anymore. I'm done with the slides. Thank you. The reason I've chosen Peter is because for a number of reasons that you'll understand as I work through the message, but he experienced the full cycle of a believer's life. He was called from humble beginnings as a fisherman. He experienced the supernatural in his early walk with Jesus Christ. And brother Brandham says about him speak to the rock. He said Peter just lost all his dignity and everything. He jumped upon a soap box. This is after he's filled with the Holy Spirit and begin to preach. My a soapbox preacher. Yes, sir. What was it? He had the Holy Ghost. He was eating of the godly mana. &gt;&gt; And why Christ speak? He said he met a man by the name of Peter. And he said to him and he told him, "Your name is Simon and you're the son of Jonas." &gt;&gt; And he believed him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because Moses had said before this time, the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet just like me. &gt;&gt; And that'll be the sign you'll know. &gt;&gt; He'll be a God prophet. &gt;&gt; The Messiah &gt;&gt; will be both God and prophet. &gt;&gt; And he'll do the same. He'll do the sign of a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When he does. &gt;&gt; And he says that's what Peter caught that I'll say Peter was called with his brother Andrew. Something was made known to them. But the Bible tells us that they were casting their net. &gt;&gt; They were actually in action. They were they weren't just fishing with a pole. They were casting their net. This was their livelihood. And Jesus came by and called. &gt;&gt; Did they have a revelation? I probably not. But something surely happened. &gt;&gt; And no doubt every person here &gt;&gt; will be able to say that. Something happened. I don't know exactly what. I don't know exactly why I followed this man, but I was gripped. And I followed him and I left my net. You mean you left your job, you left your position, you left your friends or whatever more? &gt;&gt; Yes, I did. &gt;&gt; What in the world happened? I'm not too sure. &gt;&gt; And then Jesus comes to Peter's house. So he had a house and he was married and his wife's mother was sick with a fever. a little simple thing and he healed her. &gt;&gt; And I thought, goodness. Wow. &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why I left my net. &gt;&gt; This is something more than I'd expected. &gt;&gt; And he was one that was sent out to preach and to heal the sick. &gt;&gt; He experienced that. &gt;&gt; He's been called impetuous Peter because he was one that would do things on the spur of the moment. So he saw this figure on walking on the water and they were frightened. They thought it's a spirit and and he said, "Lord, if it's you, let allow call me and let me step out." &gt;&gt; And he stepped over the railing of that boat &gt;&gt; and walked on the water. Others said, "Oh yeah, but he sank." I'm proud of him that he stepped out of the boat &gt;&gt; and he did spend some time moments walking on the water. &gt;&gt; These all were distinct seasons of revelation. To what degree, I don't know. &gt;&gt; But they were distinct seasons of revelation. and he had his joy and he he saw all this glorious power &gt;&gt; and the people wanting to make his leader a king &gt;&gt; and it must have been moving for him to be associated and not only associated he became one of the inner circle &gt;&gt; Peter James and John Peter James and John Peter James and John maybe even the rest didn't understand that and really didn't like it that much But Jesus sometimes would call him Peter, James, and John. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Peter already had many supernatural experiences being chosen and associated with the Lord Jesus Christ. He most definitely was one of the inner circle. He was chosen with John and James to be on the Mount Transfiguration. Now he's moved from fishing to the Mount of Transfiguration. &gt;&gt; Yes. for a revelation of Jesus Christ as the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Peter sees the transfiguration. &gt;&gt; He sees Moses and he sees Elijah. &gt;&gt; Right. The secret of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ can only come from God our father and by no other way. Peter could tell of what came. But now friends, this is not out of a book. This is just how God spoke by one heart. Peter could tell of what come over him when he heard Jesus call and and what it was that caused him to leave the fishing and to follow Christ and seeing the multitudes healed and being sent out to preach. He could talk all about that. And seeing the miracles yet there was another season. Yes, &gt;&gt; there was another season &gt;&gt; that had to come &gt;&gt; and when Jesus was coming to the coast of Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples saying, "Who do men say that I am? &gt;&gt; That I the son of man am." &gt;&gt; And they said, "Some say they had this knowledge. Some say that you're John the Baptist and others Elias. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah or one of the prophets? And he says unto them, but who say ye that I am? And Simon Peter. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why I wanted to follow through with Simon Peter. &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God." [Applause] Now friends, &gt;&gt; that phrase had never been spoken before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't learn it. &gt;&gt; He didn't read it in a book. &gt;&gt; That phrase was not in the Torah or the Bible. &gt;&gt; He didn't learn it in Sunday school. &gt;&gt; He didn't hear any rabbi say it. Where did it come from? &gt;&gt; Where did it come from? So specifically, &gt;&gt; thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Try to absorb this. &gt;&gt; Now here comes the prophet messenger who saw that light. Saw him all the time. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Saw him regularly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said in paradox &gt;&gt; and I'm going to be coming to the what I think is the paradox of all paradoxes. He said, you know, Paul never did see Jesus in physical form. &gt;&gt; He said he had to accept the revelation just like Peter did. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul had to receive it just like Peter did. &gt;&gt; Peter saw him in the flesh. Paul never saw him in the flesh, but he said Pet had to receive it like Peter did. &gt;&gt; He said Peter &gt;&gt; never knew Jesus by physical form. &gt;&gt; I want you to put that down. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's in paradox &gt;&gt; in Chicago in 1963. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. I want you to absorb it into your own in your own experience &gt;&gt; because we're so earthly. We're so tied to mortal life &gt;&gt; and we need to be moved. If if there's any people that need to be moved out of this cycle in season of mortal life, it's you. &gt;&gt; And me, &gt;&gt; and you and those up on the balcony and those &gt;&gt; on the internet, it's you. &gt;&gt; We need to be moved out of this cycle and season of mortal life &gt;&gt; because down here we suffer from sickness. We suffer from infirmities. We have financial disasters and financial things. We have educational and peer uh peer pressure. We have all kinds of things pulling on us from different directions that we have. That's part of mortal life &gt;&gt; this mortal season. Let me announce to you that has no place in the immortal realm. [Music] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Peter never did know Jesus by physical form." And he said, "Who does men say that I, the son of man, am?" Some of them said, "You're Moses or you're Elias, you're Jeremiah." He said, "Now, that's not what I asked you. What do you say?" Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And he said, &gt;&gt; I want you to be focused this way. Babies will always be babies. Young people will always be young people. But look this way. &gt;&gt; I'll not preach this again. Just like this. Blessed art thou Simon Barjonah. What's your name? &gt;&gt; Put your name there. &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, &gt;&gt; Brother Ernie. &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, Brother John. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, Sister Briana or whoever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou. Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you. &gt;&gt; But my father which is in heaven &gt;&gt; has revealed it to you. &gt;&gt; What is he revealing? He's revealing the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; The secret of his tabernacle &gt;&gt; that you might know him whom to know his life eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's in you &gt;&gt; in a measure. He's in me in a measure. &gt;&gt; He's in the prophet of God in a measure. &gt;&gt; But he was in Christ without measure. &gt;&gt; And that Christ without measure has chosen you to be part of his measurement. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That is your calling in this life. You are not called just to work. &gt;&gt; You are not called just to have a profession. &gt;&gt; You are not called just to get an education, get all you can. &gt;&gt; Earn all you can &gt;&gt; and give all you can. &gt;&gt; You're not called to just come here to this church. &gt;&gt; That's not it. This is all part of the program. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Thank you, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you. &gt;&gt; And upon this rock, I'll build my church, and the gates of hell &gt;&gt; cannot prevail against it. &gt;&gt; I want you to listen very, very carefully because here is the secret of your victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And there you are, a paradox." when he was standing there &gt;&gt; and didn't know him in human flesh, but he knowed him by his works and his revelation. Yes. &gt;&gt; It take a special gift from God &gt;&gt; for you to look beyond this flesh &gt;&gt; or the flesh of somebody sitting next to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Say, "Why are you here? &gt;&gt; Why are you here? Why is anybody here? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We may have a big variety of answers why I'm here. I'm here because my parents come. I'm here because my wife, my husband. I'm here because it's Sunday morning. We always go to church. Sorry folks. That's wonderful. But it's got to go a lot deeper than that. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm here because I'm going to interact &gt;&gt; with the God &gt;&gt; my God &gt;&gt; in other people. &gt;&gt; I'm here to be impacted &gt;&gt; and I'm here to impact somebody else. &gt;&gt; I'm here because I'm connected to an immortal realm. I'm here because I have identified an immortal season &gt;&gt; creeping in, flowing in upon the mortal season. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make some statements. You might think I'm crazy. I'm going to make them anyway. as Jesus moved and as Peter moved also. &gt;&gt; Can I say this about Peter? And then I'm going to come I want to come right to this transition time. &gt;&gt; And the fact that Peter came to it is not an accident. &gt;&gt; The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is not an accident. And it's not it is a one time in history but it was the crisis. It was the crux of history. It was the apex &gt;&gt; for the redemption of the world. &gt;&gt; And listen friends, &gt;&gt; don't take this as a sermon, please. &gt;&gt; But when that beloved son of God said it is finished, &gt;&gt; that has to affect you where you're sitting today. [Applause] [Music] Praise God. &gt;&gt; Then came Peter to him and said, "How often we're following Peter, &gt;&gt; how oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times &gt;&gt; and you know the answer of Jesus." &gt;&gt; And then Peter said unto him, "Behold, we've forsaken all and we've followed you. What shall we have? &gt;&gt; Therefore, and Peter said to Jesus, "Though all men shall be offended because of thee, I will never be offended." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And finally, Peter said, "And though I should die with thee, yet I will not deny thee." Likewise also said all the disciples. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he took with him, Jesus did, took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. &gt;&gt; Here's just wondered. &gt;&gt; I walked on the water with him. &gt;&gt; I handed out bread and we took up 12 baskets. &gt;&gt; I I saw cooked fish grow in my hands. We fed thousands. &gt;&gt; I saw the lame walk. I saw the blind. I heard them cry out. I saw that. &gt;&gt; And now he's seeing him. He's entering another season. &gt;&gt; And he sees him become very sorrowful. And he took with him the inner circle, Peter, James, and John. And he began to be very sorrowful. And Jesus comes to them and said and findeth them asleep. Here's the man that just said, "I'm going to die with you. I'll never be offended." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "But could you not watch with me one hour? And then they've taken him now and they're going to take him to the judgment hall. And the Bible says, "And Peter followed a far off under the high priest place." He he wasn't in church Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; He wasn't staying close in his footsteps. Then &gt;&gt; things were going, he was entering another season, a season he didn't expect. Listen to me now everybody. I want every visitor. &gt;&gt; I want you all to listen. You think this is just religion. This is a long ways from religion. &gt;&gt; This on another planet from religion. This has nothing to do with churchity or religiosity. &gt;&gt; And this quite frankly never came out of a book. This &gt;&gt; came from the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; stirring my own soul. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is about where I was, brother Vile, when I call you. And Peter followed him a far off under the high priest's palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the end. He wasn't rejoicing. He wasn't dancing in the spirit. &gt;&gt; He wasn't saying, "Hear ye me. And Peter sat without in the palace and a damsel young lady cometh to him and said, "Thou also was with Jesus of Galilee." &gt;&gt; And he denied it. &gt;&gt; He denied before them all. Say, "I know not what you're saying." &gt;&gt; You think he's forgotten, saying, "They're the Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; No, he didn't forget that. Listen friends, I don't know how this going to end up, but it was just in another season. &gt;&gt; But that revelation &gt;&gt; would hold him through anything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And after a while came unto him, they that stood by and said to Peter, "Surely thou art one of them, for your speech betrayeth you." You have a little different language. &gt;&gt; You talk about Revelation 10. You talk about the cloud. You talk about other things. You talk about the seven church ages. You talk about stuff that I know that it's identified with him. &gt;&gt; And he denied it. And Peter said, "Man, I know not what you're saying." &gt;&gt; And immediately while he spake, the crew &gt;&gt; and the Lord turned &gt;&gt; and just looked upon Peter. &gt;&gt; And Peter remembered the word of the Lord. Think about it. And Peter went out and wept bitterly. After the news of the resurrection and the women came, Peter rose and ran to the sephiler &gt;&gt; and stooping down and he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and he departed wandering in himself at that which it had happened. The seasons are changing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Both in this world and in the unseen world. &gt;&gt; Now, if you ever prayed, pray for yourself right now. Say, "God, lift me up so I can see &gt;&gt; what brother Ed is succumbing to." &gt;&gt; Angels are descending. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Here's Peter. He's just wept. He denied the Lord and he's gone out. I'm a failure &gt;&gt; and are filled with fear and disillusionment. &gt;&gt; Not just when Christ was there 2,000 years ago. I'm up to today. I'm not even back just when the prophet spoke when he spoke and took the and took his second last service &gt;&gt; and spoke to you and me &gt;&gt; from Luke 24 &gt;&gt; and called it a prophecy. &gt;&gt; I'm going to make another announcement today. You are living the fulfillment of that prophecy. &gt;&gt; They had the deniers. Yes, &gt;&gt; they had the spirit of Judas. Don't think that passed away with Judas. &gt;&gt; That'll be even more prevalent &gt;&gt; in this time. &gt;&gt; They had leaders, religious leaders, scholars of the word, and they believed exactly the same thing. They were completely the political system. Even Herod and and Pilate, they became friends over this denial of Jesus Christ. All this confusion had to happen at that time and must be today as well. &gt;&gt; And I have another announcement to make to one and to all. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You have no business &gt;&gt; becoming consumed with that. &gt;&gt; Just because you can tap stuff, &gt;&gt; but just because you're accessed digitally, you have no business being connected to that stuff. You have no business feeding on unbelief. &gt;&gt; I'm saying that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; you forget it and leave it behind. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know it only brings a cloud of doubt, &gt;&gt; a cloud of disappointment to you. You have no business feeding on it. You have no business answering it. Did Jesus ever talk about Judas again? Did he ever talk about all his other Did he talk about Ananas the high priest? Did he talk about all these that brought accusations? They don't even name the people who brought false accus. And two witnesses came in. You don't even know who they are. They're not important enough for this book. &gt;&gt; And if they're not important enough for this book, they have no place in your mind. the seasons were changing. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about now. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about right now. &gt;&gt; And you probably you may not know any more than Peter knew. &gt;&gt; He didn't know angels &gt;&gt; were stirring in heaven, &gt;&gt; in another world, &gt;&gt; in another place. Angels were being dispatched &gt;&gt; and gathered &gt;&gt; and instructed &gt;&gt; this is what you'll say and this is where you'll go. &gt;&gt; You're not going to go to some great victory revival. You're going to go to a tomb &gt;&gt; and you're going to talk to people who come there to to treat the dead &gt;&gt; and you're going to tell them &gt;&gt; this is what you're going to say. He's risen. &gt;&gt; Angels dispatched. They didn't know it. The season was changing. &gt;&gt; And we talk about a prophet of God and an angel of God was with them and so on. That angel stayed with this message all the way through the years because I knew that that angel, that angel of God who's none other than Jesus Christ, is going to call a people by this voice. &gt;&gt; It'll be his voice. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Marilyn, I thought of the song that Marilyn was inspired. Samuel &gt;&gt; heard a voice from a supernatural place. &gt;&gt; I said, Ed, &gt;&gt; I've heard a voice &gt;&gt; from a supernatural place. &gt;&gt; Lazarus &gt;&gt; heard the same. &gt;&gt; Though he was in the grave. &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God in this generation says, "A roll call in heaven." &gt;&gt; A roll call in heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that master's voice. &gt;&gt; He said even the atoms are changing. &gt;&gt; And that's what transition is. Transition can be a changing of molecular change, a change of the atoms. And this prophet said there'll be a sweep &gt;&gt; go over you &gt;&gt; and you'll change in your atoms. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's also that sayith the Lord. We who are alive and remain. &gt;&gt; We shall not all sleep, &gt;&gt; but we'll be caught up together. &gt;&gt; Not in this old carcass. &gt;&gt; We're in a transformation time. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; yes, we are. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, Lord. And while the disciples &gt;&gt; are fearful and appear to be in disarray, &gt;&gt; their leader and captain of their faith &gt;&gt; is empty out paradise. &gt;&gt; While they were locked up, &gt;&gt; hiding themselves, &gt;&gt; the very one that they were crying and weeping over &gt;&gt; was emptying out paradise. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You shout if you want. &gt;&gt; This is the most glorious thing. &gt;&gt; While they were hiding, &gt;&gt; Jesus was bringing them out of their hiding &gt;&gt; and bringing them into &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; And they were seen of many. The bodies, the bodies of the saints were seen in the streets of Jerusalem. [Music] To whom? &gt;&gt; Not to all the people, &gt;&gt; but to those &gt;&gt; that were elected &gt;&gt; before time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. &gt;&gt; Is this what I'm in? This what you're in, brother John? &gt;&gt; This is what you're in. But Stephen had nothing to do with SFU. Right. &gt;&gt; That's why God had you born where you are. &gt;&gt; That's why God had you hear what you heard. &gt;&gt; And why? What's happening? What come to you, brother Bisc? What the Holy Spirit speak to me? It was the merging &gt;&gt; of two worlds. &gt;&gt; The one that you hear on tape when the prophet says, "I'm in two worlds." That one is merging with this one. [Music] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, girls. When there were more ladies ever called them than men, &gt;&gt; more ladies came before the prophet of God. One lady after another after another after another than a man, then more ladies &gt;&gt; because their spirits are more tender and more &gt;&gt; closer to the surface. &gt;&gt; He can speak to you. &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why ladies had to go to the tomb. Maybe that's why ladies had to first hear the angels speak. &gt;&gt; And the angels tell him, "Go and tell the men. &gt;&gt; Go and tell these great apostles, &gt;&gt; I'm not here. &gt;&gt; He's not here. &gt;&gt; He's risen." &gt;&gt; But the merging of two worlds were coming &gt;&gt; into place. Already the dead and risen were walking in the streets of Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; And the people didn't know. They didn't know because uh the transition now was coming to a crashing climax, a vortex, &gt;&gt; and there's no way for them to know the resurrection had happened. And Jesus, that one &gt;&gt; knew &gt;&gt; who he had spoken. This timeless one who had spoken. Now we're not ignorant and we won't be slow. when you see the days of Noah again &gt;&gt; and when you see the days of Sodom and Gomorrah &gt;&gt; and you be careful now how you respond to that because if you say we are there then the rest of it has to be there &gt;&gt; even thus shall it be &gt;&gt; when the son of man is revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it'll be the same. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As when Naomi said to uh to to Ruth, &gt;&gt; you lay there till the morning. And once he rises, once he starts, he's not going to stop. &gt;&gt; This process is going to continue straight on &gt;&gt; until you're married, &gt;&gt; until you're pregnantated, &gt;&gt; until you're bringing forth the lineage of the kings. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Are you able to grasp that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is why we had to have thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Not to hear it here &gt;&gt; and to hold it here, &gt;&gt; but receive it down into the womb of our soul. &gt;&gt; Transforming power. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your dilemma is. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your weakness is. This word is greater than that. &gt;&gt; And Jesus knew. He knew that his faithful messenger &gt;&gt; right at the end of his life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to be told and instructed said now you have six or eight hours to speak. He didn't have to be told that. He's going to get up and speak what God gives him to speak. Right? &gt;&gt; He's going to go in the scripture where he's supposed to go. &gt;&gt; So he goes to Luke 24 &gt;&gt; and he's going to call it what he's supposed to call it, &gt;&gt; modern events. &gt;&gt; Made clear &gt;&gt; by prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Read it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And say it's a prophecy. What's happening there? Peter's there. &gt;&gt; Peter's in that prophecy. You're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's there in the prophecy. You're here fulfilling it. &gt;&gt; He didn't know what was happening. You don't know what's happening. &gt;&gt; There's a merging of two worlds at that time. There's a merging of two worlds. That's why God sent you a messenger that would say over and over, &gt;&gt; dozens of times. &gt;&gt; I'm in two worlds. &gt;&gt; This is the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, this is the sign of the Messiah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who can do this? Nobody but the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why this that's why brother Brown said it's not me. &gt;&gt; It's him. &gt;&gt; Now you have a certain feeling. Not because of me. I'm your brother. &gt;&gt; But it's because of him who's here. &gt;&gt; Who is him? &gt;&gt; And where is him &gt;&gt; now? &gt;&gt; Amen. Today &gt;&gt; in this service, &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, where is he? &gt;&gt; Would you like to say so? &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; And he's indwelling me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I call this the paradox of all paradoxes. And you may be in it or you may be part of it right now. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, did you hear what's happening down here? Did you hear what's happening?" No, I didn't hear. I don't need to hear. And I have no desire to hear. &gt;&gt; Why would you want to hear? &gt;&gt; Do you get a revelation from it? &gt;&gt; Do you get stimulated by it? &gt;&gt; Of course not. right now. &gt;&gt; He didn't realize &gt;&gt; that. And here's my words. Two worlds &gt;&gt; almost merging. &gt;&gt; Help me brothers. I I went back into the very meetings I was in. &gt;&gt; You have it on tape. Almost every time I'm in a message, I scroll to the end because I'm and that's why I was so moved. I said, "I love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I just love you so much &gt;&gt; to think that you would even take time &gt;&gt; and use this vessel. Let him just become so weakened over the visions &gt;&gt; to tell a person you have sinus or this. And we're not here just to repeat those things. &gt;&gt; Those things were done that you might know. &gt;&gt; He came to call your name through that. &gt;&gt; And something along the way, if it hasn't happened, may it happen now. And I know that there are those where it needs to happen to you. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. It needs to happen. &gt;&gt; He'll hide you in the tabernacle or in the secret of his tabernacle. You must identify where this Christ is. &gt;&gt; And he gave the sign. He gave it abundantly. &gt;&gt; God could say, "What more can I do?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What more can I do? &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Excuse me for becoming so personal. If you were God, what would you do? &gt;&gt; You're going to come, you're going to bring the world to judgment. What would you do &gt;&gt; if you were the Almighty? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Creator of heaven. What would you do? I said, 'Well, I think I'll I'll send my most faithful servant, &gt;&gt; my most faithful prophet, &gt;&gt; that I was ever able ever raised up, &gt;&gt; one that stood by me, &gt;&gt; the spirit of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I did send him before I came in the form of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I sent him. What a bold, brave man he was. &gt;&gt; And he just he wouldn't compromise on anything. &gt;&gt; And he only ministered for a few months and they cast him into prison. &gt;&gt; And then a little girl, 8 years old, I believe she was, she danced, did a little jigging. &gt;&gt; And the king has just caught up and says, "I'll give you half of the kingdom. What do you ask? Mommy, what should I ask for? Ask for John the John the Baptist head &gt;&gt; on a charger. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist head because that's where his mouth was. &gt;&gt; And the conviction which he held &gt;&gt; was worth more than half the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Where's that king? Where's that girl? &gt;&gt; Where's that woman? They're gone. But the spirit that was on John the Baptist and his testimony lives on. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The world can say what they wish to say about you, but the truth shall prevail every time. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Daniel. &gt;&gt; You keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a great revelation at this time. We're in the merging of two worlds. &gt;&gt; And that's why your messenger, not me. Your messenger &gt;&gt; was constantly being pressed from one world to another. &gt;&gt; You see him on deep call to the deep. He's shaking his head because he doesn't know if he's over there or here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; I can't even tell you what goes on in my heart right now. &gt;&gt; I was being crushed. I was literally crushed as a young man who's 27. I was your age, Daniel. Jessica, I was your age, Philillip. That's why I can relate to Peter. I thought everything going sideways. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I didn't have enough to feed my family. And I just tell you, what a paradox. I just taken the lowest, most cumbersome, most dirty job you could imagine. Listen, kids. I washed floors. I polished floors for little widows in Victoria. I washed walls in businessmen's offices and I was barely getting enough to put bread and food on the table, but I had a burden to go to the native Indian people &gt;&gt; and I was going to do that above all things. &gt;&gt; Why? I don't know why. And now I wrote I wrote I I do go brother Vanom. I wrote a wrote him a letter &gt;&gt; and he responded and ended up I'm up in the mountains. In the meantime I have I have two things that are crushing my heart. And one is a certain church organization, which I won't name, was trying to persuade the people of the church that I'd resigned from to vote the property and brand new church we had just built into their organization just by a vote and take it all. How low, &gt;&gt; how corrupt, &gt;&gt; rather than give and build it themselves, &gt;&gt; take it. And one of the deacons called me to was Cindy Bergen's dad. He was my deacon, one of them. And he called me. And he said, "If you're going to save this church, you better get up here. We're losing it." But Tim knows the church. And I did go up and I spoke to some of the people and I spoke to the young pastor who was filling in for my brother-in-law, brother Brena. And my my sister, not Anne, but my other younger sister. She was in great great need. That was her son that text me this morning. I appreciate you bearing with me. It didn't come to me while I was in the study. She was carrying that boy that text me this morning for the first time. I don't remember him ever texting me. She was carrying him when this happened. And because of my job, because of because of responsibilities of mortal life this season, I had to leave the whole group that were up hunting. I had to leave them. I had arranged everything and all the rest of it, but I couldn't stay. I had to leave. It's magnificent place, but I won't talk about that. I'll talk about the morning I woke up and I was leaving everybody. And we were about 25 miles into the wilderness. Listen friends, my name isn't Peter, but this is my story. &gt;&gt; Peter had his low moments, and this was mine. &gt;&gt; And here here I've got a a man that I understand as a prophet of God, Brother John. I'm not I haven't experienced very much. It's like it's like Peter was called and he left his boat and Matson went and he sees these great things happening and I was in the meetings and I saw these great things happening and I feel so privileged I'm able to take him and now right in my hour of need I have to leave and I am in capital letters crushed. Absolutely crushed. Had two things on my heart. My sister and the church that I built and we're there one week and I'm not able to get even a word in edgewise and and brother Bram and I and another brother Fred Soffman are sleeping in a tent off to the side. I always it's the only time I ever slept in another another tent. I always slept in the cook house in a cook tent. And so we finished breakfast and I I had said to brother Southwick, I said, "Brother Bud, will Blaine, will you send Blaine out with me?" I had to ride 25 miles on a horse, crossing rivers maybe 15 or 20 times. And sometime you cross a a great valley and and and and I didn't know where the trail was and going down the gravel the the gravel bar or the sand bar I could maybe see tracks but in the gravel bar I couldn't see anything there. Grizzlies all over all kinds of animals. And I woke up in the morning and we were in a snowstorm, terrible snowstorm. And I said to brother Bud, I said, 'Well, aren't you going to send Blaine with me? And he said, 'N no. I said, 'You know, the horse knows his way back. Well, folks, I've been around horses. I've had them walk into the trees, you know, they would just walk into the bush and come before a tree and just stand there waiting for me to give them some direction. I thought if the horse walks into the into the jungle and and wants some direction, I won't know which way to go. And I'm 25, 30 miles &gt;&gt; and I'm going to ride in this snow and I go into my tent and I'm alone and I'm rolling up my sleeping bag. Those of you that have the picture of Brother Brandham, that happened the night before, you just have to excuse me. I'm not I'm not emotional because I'm emotional because of what he did. And I'm rolling up my sleeping bag and this big flakes of snow, just huge flakes of snow. You can't even see. You can't see hardly anything. And I thought, I'm going to ride out in this. And here's my friend, my good friend, and he's going to send me out of this wilderness on a horse through country. I don't have a clue where I'm going. You're going to head them down a there's no path as such. He's going to find his way out of this Rocky Mountain trench. And I'm rolling up my sleeping bag and the flaps open. And on his hands and knees comes brother Brandham. And he sits cross-legged like so. And he sits down. He said, "Really sorry to see you go, brother Eddie." Yeah. And I'm just barely holding myself together and I'm rolling up my sleeping bag. Oh, he said, ' It'd be nice if you could just stay here and the sun would come out and be nice and warm and we'd just stay up here about a month. And I bit my lip, don't do this to me, Brother Brandham. My heart is already broken and I got to leave and I'm not even didn't even have a chance. I arranged this hunt. I did all his work and came up here and now I can't even ask him about my burden. He said it would be nice and warm. We'd just stay up here maybe a month or so and you know we'd find some big rams up on the mountain and and that's just when I was my lip was trembling I suppose. I don't know but I was just breaking inside. Then then he just changed. He said but I know how it is. He said, "You're married and you have children. Now he stepped into mortal life. This is a season of mortal life. You have children. You've got responsibilities. You have to go to work." But he said, "But I know all about your sister and your church. and eternal the immortal world just came and merged with this one &gt;&gt; in an instant and I knew that wasn't him. It wasn't William Brham that knew all about him, but someone else was speaking. &gt;&gt; And soon as he said that, I know all about your sister and the church in Dawson Creek. He said, "Why did I tell you that this morning? I want to say to you, I I love you all. That one who spoke to me when I thought that he was a million miles away and I thought that my troubles were so enormous nobody could solve them. Nobody even knew about them. I'm here to tell you that one &gt;&gt; that one who spoke is closer to you than you dare think. And he's trying to tell you something this morning. &gt;&gt; The message that you have believed, I declare to you in the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; that world, he said, I go to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that world, I'll send my messenger &gt;&gt; and he'll declare these things. And now just before he leaves and you think we were all rejoicing. I was here in Vancouver when I got a phone call from a old friend of mine said William Brandham's been in a car accident. They don't expect him to live and I was getting ready to go with him. I was on a plane in Toronto and I don't know whether he's going to live or not. Sometimes the bottom, it's like the bottom falls out of things. But does Jesus care? &gt;&gt; Yes, he cares. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I can tell you he has the answer &gt;&gt; for every single person in this place. &gt;&gt; He was so concerned. He could tell me exactly about where all these things and what was troubling me. And he said, "I know about it." &gt;&gt; And I look over this congregation. I know there are things that perhaps you can't even begin to describe to anybody. Maybe not your wife or your closest friend, but he knows &gt;&gt; this one and this world. And I felt I felt responsible this morning. I felt this morning that I was to come and announce to you that he on behalf of him, he has already sent his messenger. Amen. &gt;&gt; And expressed through him that this is that time. &gt;&gt; This is that hour. And he knew that he was just here to run through it. And he ran his race finished and left a message for the people. &gt;&gt; And the elect will hear the call &gt;&gt; and they won't know why they heard it. They won't they won't know how sometimes to even respond. and and and and and maybe things in this mortal life make you feel like giving up. &gt;&gt; But to the elect, &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make you elect, but to the elect, they can't give up. &gt;&gt; They cannot surrender it. &gt;&gt; And you may not realize it, but all the things that have were right precise exactly where we're supposed to be. people raise up and they have all kinds of ideas and all kinds of thoughts and ah it's this way it's that way be at peace &gt;&gt; and right in the middle of this I'm not done preaching I'm just finishing I'm just winding up listen very closely and right I if I stayed with this Peter one of the next things he heard was after he heard the women and now they're all troubled next thing he hears is a voice saying, "Peace &gt;&gt; be unto you." &gt;&gt; And I felt so compelled of the Holy Spirit to say to this audience this morning, "Peace &gt;&gt; be unto you &gt;&gt; in the world." In the world, you'll have tribulation, &gt;&gt; but don't fear. &gt;&gt; I've overcome the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you bow your head with me? &gt;&gt; Our precious Lord Jesus. What a delight it is to know you whom to know is life eternal. I'm so grateful to you for having you having made known yourself. the very tabernacle of God &gt;&gt; and making known to us the secret of your tabernacle. How you have embodied yourself in your word and have given something that we call a message. But to us, it's not just some words. It's not some books. It's not some tapes. They can't contain everything that the almighty God is and what you would make known to us and how you would you would reveal yourself to us, Lord. And you have a selected portion for every person. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I look over this audience and see the balcony and the people sitting here and they even from children to those oh God who are faced with decisions I pray father in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus you've experienced Lord all of these things and Peter who I spoke of which was one of your great apostles and he it was that stood on the day of Pentecost and he began to declare he began to declare now this indwelling the same spirit that was in you that raised you from the dead now is in them. And now at the end of the at the end of the age, here we are at the end of the days and we're certainly we have identified the day that we're living in. What a what a wicked and vile time it is. How how dark it is. And is the world filled with violence? And we will say yes. Is there perversion everywhere? We will say yes, there is. Then be it known unto you that this is the day when the son of man will be revealed and you have been revealed and we have seen you Lord. We see you in all the beauty of your word and we can say once again the father has revealed to us Jesus Christ and you are absolutely wonderful. &gt;&gt; You are so beautiful. So wonderful, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we're just here to give thanks to you. &gt;&gt; Thank you for remembering my name. &gt;&gt; Thank you for calling us by name, oh God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And our name that was perhaps given to us by a loving father and mother. We do not know who, but you called us by another name. You called us by what we were supposed to be and called to be. &gt;&gt; And now we love you, Lord. We love you. And I just pray that you will help us in the rest of this service. We're thinking of Brother Kyle and Sister Christina on the island and the saints there, Brother John going down to Seattle and Reon. And I pray, oh God, let this presence, &gt;&gt; let this divine one, &gt;&gt; Lord, be amongst them. Would you please? I pray that you'll walk into that gathering room. Amen. &gt;&gt; And tonight when we gather here and our brother Tim Dodd will stand to minister. Father, I know not what you've given him to say, but I want to be spoken to. &gt;&gt; And help us, oh God. I'm praying for this congregation of people at this uh conclusion, this conclusion of time, at this merging of the worlds. Help us to be Lord aware of the unseen. Help us to look upon the unseen. Help us to look upon the prize, oh God, of the high calling in Christ Jesus, oh Father, if there's any here that don't know you and would want to know you. You will make yourself known to them. I know you will. I pray, Father, you'll give them the courage. &gt;&gt; There may be others, Father, needing to be filled with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You're the baptizer. You're the only one that can do it. The needs are as many as we are as individuals. I pray you'll come to each one of us. Lord, I have my own personal need and I pray, Father, that you will minister to me today in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonder if we can have the musicians. Yes. You could stand if you would. Could we sing Christ the transforming light? [Music] Just be patient for a little bit, would you today, please? [Music] Yeah, we sickness. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing a dorser or two of this. touches his heart of mine. Is he touching it? Piercing the darkness, making his glory shine. Listen to this prayer now. Oh, his grace causing the world to see. Love that will shall go. Jesus revealing me. Second verse. Now here Lord I pray my heart [Music] my strength. Will you lay it all down now with all my spirit [Music] to his gra [Music] to Love that will still shall Jesus re. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're going to sing this third verse. [Music] Life is no longer mine. Maybe you need to make that kind of a dedication. You can do it in your seat. You might want to stand and gather around the pulpit here. Whatever. Just between you and God. I would like these words somehow to sink down. Lay hold of the secret part of your own soul. Life is no longer mine. I want to say it. I want the Edis to say, I yield it all to thee. Fill me that I may shine [Music] until thy face I see. I know, friends. I I wouldn't be a true friend of yours if I didn't say I know that there are those here who haven't arrived there yet. [Music] And maybe you want to make that kind of a declaration. Maybe you want to maybe you want to say before this assembly of people, I'm praying and I'm yearning that these words will in fact take place today in my life. And if you'd like to, if you wish to do that, I give you this opportunity. There's no pull. I'm not going to try to persuade you. Let it be between you and and this Lord Jesus. And I want to say because I'm just closing now. I want it known to you. Today was not just another service. Today God was announcing to you that we are in the midst of a transition. We are in the midst of a change of the seasons. &gt;&gt; This is another season of revelation. This is not the season where we just attend church. There's a season. And now you might say, "Well, I don't feel anything." There were many that were right in Brother Brandham's meetings and never felt anything. There were many that listened to Jesus Christ that didn't feel anything. Don't wait till you feel something. &gt;&gt; Wait till you hear something. I've heard it. Now I am responding to that. &gt;&gt; I've held certain ideas or I've held certain things or certain feelings or whatever more. I I don't care about those. It could be about me or anybody else that's irrelevant to me. My concern is for you. [Music] &gt;&gt; The season of this mortal life is merging with the immortal. I'm convinced of that. And we say there'll be a rapture. There'll be a rapture. There will indeed be a rapture. And that could happen before this service is even concluded and over. It'll not be the way we figured it out, but it will happen the way he intended it to be. &gt;&gt; May God have his way. We'll sing this verse together and then we're going to close soon after that. &gt;&gt; Life is no longer mine. So [Music] I totally [Music] Oh, [Music] the world to see [Music] that will [Music] Now Jesus came life is no longer mine. God bless you dear ones. I pray earnestly that you'll be so affected and so moved that you'll leave this place on another plane and on another level that you'll never be the same. You young people and young men and young ladies that have been spending time. I prayed for you. I thought I thought of you. May you come to know him in a dimension you never ever ever dreamed of. &gt;&gt; He's much more real. &gt;&gt; He's more than just a prayer service. &gt;&gt; He's more than a youth meeting. &gt;&gt; He's more than a Sunday morning service. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the person. The person. Can you take time for this person? [Music] [Music] Life is no longer [Music] I toe [Music] that I may shine. [Music] until I face my I see all to prepare his graing [Music] the world to see that will Oh shall Jesus reveal in &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. We've come to the season of the closing of this time that we've gathered together here. We'll meet again this evening. Others are meeting now. Brother John Andy's will be ministered. I pray Lord Jesus you'll stand beside him &gt;&gt; and that you'll speak through him words that need to be heard by the people your beloved in Renton. And Lord Jesus for all that are here sometimes we do not know exactly how to respond. [Music] I don't know what will take place. I don't know what kind of a meeting it will be or even if it will be a meeting or we will be whether we're at our place of duty or at our place of work. Lord, whatever it is, but help us, oh God, that we do not miss that moment. And as your prophet of God was beyond the curtain of time and saw the people and embraced them and told us of that time and exactly what it was like and Lord Jesus as you were coming back as it were and you came from a resurrected you came through a resurrected life and you began to speak to the disciples and they were filled with such fear and and there were so many many questions that were that they didn't have answers for but you you said to them feel me. It's it's me. is I don't be afraid. And Lord, how a prophet said so many times he he knew by that same voice and the thing that always was spoken, fear not. And here we are this morning, Lord. And maybe some are fearful just to yield to everything. And perhaps we don't know exactly how. Be tender with us, Lord. I pray. Be patient with us, I pray. And just show us the best way. Show us the best way, Lord Jesus. Help us as we offer ourselves to you, I pray. And dismiss us with your grace and your blessings. And may your presence go with us. And when the people close the door of the car and hear it shut, may there be that such a strange and wonderful holy presence that will surround them that they might know it is Jesus. It is none other than Jesus Christ. the same yesterday, today, and forever. [Music] &gt;&gt; I ask it in your name. Amen. Amen. I wonder if we could sing that chorus. I must tell Jesus. I must tell Jesus. Let's just sing the chorus together and I'll be dismissing you. of Jesus. I can also [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] I must [Music] Jesus. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.

And God bless. You can remain as long as you wish. You may. For those that must go, you feel free to go. I pray that your lives will be entirely and eternally different. As you lose sight of the mortal season and the mortal realm, I can tell you when you look around you and you see what is taking place in the world that is screaming out to the believer, [Music] that whole realm of darkness is fading out. And the prophet said it's because the light &gt;&gt; is pressing the darkness back where it came from. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. And as you leave or you're dismissed in Jesus name, we'll just sing it once again. [Music] No touch. My heart you deserve for eternity and there is none like you. [Music] Oh, how I love Jesus.
