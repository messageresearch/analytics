[15:30] Amen. Thank you for your prayers.
[15:34] Hallelujah, brother Tom. You go.

[15:43] [Music]
[15:45] Father, I stand in amazement
[15:50] with the grace of God within all of our
[15:52] lives this morning.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; If we went from individual to
[15:57] individual, Lord, each one of us would
[15:59] stand in amaze and awe, that God should
[16:02] love a sinner such as I. Turn our sorrow
[16:05] into bliss.
[16:08] And Father, we're just so grateful to be
[16:10] gathered this morning in the house of
[16:11] God.
[16:13] Turmoil on every hand, upheaval
[16:15] everywhere. But we got a place that we
[16:18] can run into, Lord, and let off the
[16:19] pressure this morning to lift up holy
[16:22] hands, to lift up our voices together to
[16:25] glorify your name, Lord, for it's worthy
[16:27] of all praise and glory. And we want to
[16:29] lift it up this morning, Lord. We want
[16:31] to be united in worship. Glorify you,
[16:34] the living God. And would the lamb come
[16:36] forth once again and walk through the
[16:39] praise of your people this morning as we
[16:41] give you glory and honor as we lift up
[16:44] that holy name of Jesus Christ.
[16:47] Father, for those that are in need this
[16:49] morning, may you come on the scene.
[16:53] How often you've come in an unexpected
[16:56] way.
[16:57] When Moses was walking in a desert
[16:59] experience, but God, there was a burning
[17:01] bush standing there to awaken. Lord,
[17:04] everything that he has need of this
[17:06] morning. And that morning, Lord God, you
[17:09] quicken his life. And I pray, God, that
[17:12] that same pillar of fire would come in a
[17:14] special way and illuminate our hearts,
[17:17] Lord, and glorify you for you're worthy
[17:20] of all praise. You gave him a
[17:23] commission, Lord, and he was faithful to
[17:25] that commission. And he was not
[17:27] disobedient to that heavenly vision. And
[17:30] so Lord, we don't want to be disobedient
[17:32] to a heavenly vision that there would a
[17:34] be a bride that would stand victorious.
[17:37] A church Lord that can bind and a church
[17:39] that can loose. We want to stand in that
[17:42] vision this morning for our dear brother
[17:44] Jim. Lord, we want to stand with the
[17:47] power of loosing and that power of
[17:49] binding. we bind the enemy that you
[17:52] would loose the son of God, Lord Jesus,
[17:55] that you would heal him and strengthen
[17:58] him and let the great physician come on
[18:01] the scene this morning that there are a
[18:03] people that can believe in the power of
[18:05] your resurrection.
[18:08] Father God, if you should go by the way
[18:09] of an operation, you know all things,
[18:12] but you are the great physician that now
[18:14] is here. And Father, we pray God that
[18:16] your grace will go before him.
[18:18] strengthen him, heal him, and raise him
[18:21] up for the glory of God. We indeed do
[18:24] love him as a brother and pray, God,
[18:26] that your grace would ever rest upon
[18:28] him.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Father, we are indeed thankful for
[18:32] Sister Kayla. Lord, you watched over
[18:35] her.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; Father Richard in this accident, Lord,
[18:39] we know all things work to the good. So,
[18:41] we pray that you will turn this
[18:43] situation around and be glorified
[18:46] through it. We pray.
[18:48] And then Lord for the many needs that
[18:50] are here in the house of God. I pray
[18:53] Lord that the Holy Spirit that is
[18:54] present now will minister deeply Lord
[18:58] not only to the body but deep to the
[19:00] soul. Ignite us Lord by the power of
[19:03] your presence. Lord anoint our pastor in
[19:06] a special way and let that word flow out
[19:08] of him. For out of his belly shall flow
[19:11] rivers of living water. Lord, we're
[19:14] thirsty this morning and we want to
[19:15] drink, but we want to drink deeply,
[19:18] Lord. So, anoint the men of God. Anoint
[19:21] us, Lord. Prepare our hearts now. We
[19:23] pray. Father, take the remainder of this
[19:26] service into your divine care now. In
[19:29] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[19:36] Amen. Why don't you turn around and
[19:37] shake hands with somebody near you?
[19:41] Amen. And it's good to see everybody
[19:42] this morning.
[19:44] You may have your seats as you greet one
[19:47] another. It's good to be in the house of
[19:49] the Lord. We want to greet everyone in
[19:51] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Those
[19:52] on the telephone and the internet
[19:53] hookup. We want to say God bless you to
[19:56] you as well. We trust that it's just a
[19:57] real wonderful day. It's the Lord's day.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to have a day that's set
[20:02] aside. You don't have to have
[20:04] appointments. you don't have to be
[20:05] worried about uh the afternoon or what's
[20:08] supposed to take place because it's the
[20:10] Lord's schedule. It's just nice to have
[20:13] that opportunity. We do have a couple of
[20:15] announcements. Did uh did Ryan make it?
[20:18] Is Brianna ready?
[20:21] All right. Well, if they are here and
[20:24] ready, then uh we'll just have a special
[20:26] for you this morning. But as they're
[20:27] getting ready, do have a couple of
[20:29] announcements. Leah and Simeon Iverson
[20:32] in Belgium are happy to announce the
[20:34] birth of their son, Matio
[20:38] Adriel.
[20:41] I'm probably not saying that with enough
[20:42] accent. Born Saturday, July 23rd,
[20:46] weighing 8 lbs. So, we're all happy for
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Leah. Amen.
[20:52] We have a counselor meeting after the
[20:54] service for everyone that um has been
[20:58] contacted. We're real happy for
[21:00] everybody that's shown interest in being
[21:02] at the camp. It's absolutely
[21:04] full to the brim,
[21:07] every available space. And uh bring your
[21:10] own cot if you didn't get a confirmation
[21:12] on a bed cuz you'll probably need it.
[21:15] Praise the Lord. So that's right after
[21:17] the service this morning, this
[21:18] afternoon, um whatever time the service
[21:21] gets over, there will be a meeting in
[21:23] the chapel. Amen. We don't want to put
[21:25] any time restraints on our pastor this
[21:27] morning. I trust that the Lord will come
[21:30] and meet us in a special way once again
[21:33] today.

[26:30] Only Believe. Only believe as Brother Ed
[26:33] comes. Want to remember brother Ken
[26:35] Andes will be ministering down in
[26:37] Seattle this evening to the saints down
[26:40] there. Laboring in the body. Is it a
[26:43] body of believers? Mystical body of
[26:45] Jesus Christ. Amen. I was just listening
[26:48] to communion yesterday. Brother Brandham
[26:52] was ministering on discerning the Lord's
[26:54] body.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; And he was teaching the brother. He
[26:57] said, "Many of you here maybe don't even
[26:59] take communion because you don't really
[27:00] understand." and he started talking
[27:02] about discerning the Lord's body. And it
[27:05] struck me because it's not the body on
[27:06] the cross that you're not discerning.
[27:09] It's the Lord's body.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; It's the body of believers. He's the
[27:12] head, friends.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to terry one for another.
[27:17] Amen. I think if we come into that
[27:18] attitude in that atmosphere this
[27:20] morning, he'll come behind his word.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray for our pastor this
[27:24] morning as he comes.

[35:14] [Music]
[35:23] Let's just join together in prayer.
[35:26] Fathers were coming
[35:30] to you, the only true and living God.
[35:32] Amen.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; There is none beside you. You do things
[35:37] the way you wish to do them.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; You do things that will please you. And
[35:41] we're asking you to come take control of
[35:45] every thought, of every spirit, of every
[35:46] human spirit. Take it under control.
[35:50] Your sovereign supreme control by the
[35:52] Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus Christ.
[35:56] Pray you'll bring every thought in
[35:57] subjection.
[35:59] All of those that are streaming today
[36:01] and will ever hear this service. I pray,
[36:04] oh God, that you will take your word by
[36:07] the Holy Ghost and bring it right to the
[36:09] very core of our hearts, oh God, to our
[36:13] soul. Father, may there be a liberating
[36:15] power to any that are bound. May there
[36:17] be a healing power to those that are
[36:19] diseased and sick. May there be a
[36:22] spiritual revelation to those who have
[36:24] not had the word yet revealed to them.
[36:27] And may it be edifying to every son and
[36:29] daughter of God in the holy name of
[36:32] Jesus Christ. How we thank you for the
[36:35] saints that have gathered this morning.
[36:37] Lord, they are your children, your
[36:40] family, and we just pray you will bless
[36:43] the bride of Jesus Christ wherever she
[36:46] may be at this moment. every member,
[36:48] &gt;&gt; for everyone is precious to you. And
[36:51] now, Lord, I pray that you will give me
[36:54] a special portion that I may speak with
[36:58] clarity and that give the people
[37:00] attentive hearts, Father, that they may
[37:03] just grasp, oh God, uh what what it is
[37:06] you desire them to know.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; And we thank you for it in Jesus
[37:10] Christ's name. Amen.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:15] Well, we want to greet you all in the
[37:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ where I
[37:19] just got an email from brother Steven
[37:22] Ibali
[37:23] uh from Uganda and he wanted me to
[37:27] convey to you all of those that have
[37:29] prayed for him because right after he
[37:32] left here he had to have an operation
[37:35] and he just uh sent an email to let us
[37:38] know that he's been uh he's been
[37:41] discharged from the hospital and he's
[37:43] home now and please convey my thanks to
[37:47] you, his thanks to you. Uh so we're and
[37:51] I sent him one back said we're glad he's
[37:53] back and we're we hope that he'll regain
[37:55] his full strength right away quick. They
[37:58] have a lot to do in that country, but
[38:00] since he's been here, he felt very very
[38:02] close to the people and and he's
[38:05] probably sent me a half a dozen or more
[38:07] emails since leaving. Brother Ken Andes
[38:10] is going to be ministering in Seattle
[38:12] this afternoon. We're happy for that for
[38:14] those of you down in Seattle area. And
[38:18] uh we'd encourage you to be to the
[38:20] service. Uh since they have that new
[38:22] location, it's really wonderful. I have
[38:24] a lot of a lot of enthusiasm about about
[38:28] what God wants to do in Seattle as well
[38:31] at this time. And I noticed they had an
[38:34] announcement, I guess, regarding Sister
[38:36] Leah Iverson. I the reason I just
[38:40] mentioned her is I I she was uh carrying
[38:44] this child just when we were in
[38:47] Switzerland and I turned around on one
[38:49] occasion and I just look she was just
[38:52] standing all the people are sitting but
[38:54] she's standing and she's running the
[38:57] projector for all the songs on the
[38:59] screen and as far along as she was just
[39:02] a short time from having birth I just
[39:04] thought in my heart God bless Sister Leo
[39:07] standing there faithful in every service
[39:10] to a day and running that uh uh running
[39:13] the song. I I believe that God sees all
[39:17] of those things, doesn't he? Amen.
[39:20] I'll have you turn in your Bibles
[39:23] to the word of God. We're going to read
[39:25] out of John
[39:28] first chapter.
[39:31] And this may be a little bit different
[39:34] kind of a service, but uh you might want
[39:37] to have a pencil or pen handy, piece of
[39:40] paper to make a note. And uh
[39:45] because sometimes it's in not sometimes,
[39:48] but every time a person stands here, at
[39:51] least for myself, you've spent maybe
[39:53] days, maybe weeks pondering a certain
[39:56] thing. And it may tie into something
[39:58] that you have that God has been
[40:01] uh expanding in your own understanding
[40:03] over a period of perhaps months or years
[40:06] and then you're trying to you know bring
[40:09] it down into a vortex of of thought and
[40:12] a few words to bring it to the people
[40:14] and it's just very very difficult. So
[40:17] you pray that God will help me and help
[40:19] you and to receive something that'll be
[40:22] eternally bene beneficial for you. Uh
[40:27] uh we'll read in John the 1st chapter
[40:31] and starting at verse 6 down to 12.
[40:34] There was a man sent from God whose name
[40:37] was John. The same came for a witness to
[40:41] bear witness of the light.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; That all men through him might believe.
[40:46] He was not that light but he was sent to
[40:49] bear witness of that light.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; He was the true light. That was the true
[40:54] light, which lightth every man that
[40:56] cometh into the world. He was in the
[40:59] world, and the world was made by him,
[41:02] and the world knew him not. He came unto
[41:06] his own, and his own received him not.
[41:10] But as many as received him, to them
[41:13] gave he the power or power to become the
[41:16] sons of God, even to them that believe
[41:20] on his name.
[41:22] In John the 14th chapter, if you'll just
[41:25] turn over a few pages,
[41:28] we'll read verses just 1 to three.
[41:38] Let not your heart be troubled. You
[41:40] believe in God, believe also in me. In
[41:44] my father's house are many mansions. If
[41:48] it were not so, I would have told you. I
[41:52] go to prepare a place for you. And if I
[41:54] go and prepare a place for you, I will
[41:57] come again and receive receive you unto
[42:02] myself, that where I am, there ye may be
[42:07] also.
[42:08] Amen. God bless his word as you have
[42:11] your seats.
[42:16] kind of a simple subject, strange
[42:18] subject
[42:21] and this will be the core of the thought
[42:25] I want to speak on receiving him.
[42:29] Now that might sound very very simple
[42:31] but before we get very far you'll find
[42:34] that
[42:37] the the word receiving in the scripture
[42:42] there are there are
[42:44] 19
[42:46] different Greek words that have and and
[42:51] and refer to and reflect different
[42:53] aspects of
[42:56] uh of this receiving.
[43:00] regarding Jesus Christ himself, there's
[43:02] always been so many opinions. I mean,
[43:05] even from the days that he was here
[43:07] walking in the flesh. And it's it's
[43:09] something for us to sit here this
[43:10] morning, we perhaps would think, oh, if
[43:13] I had been back then,
[43:16] uh, it would have been different. Well,
[43:18] of course, that's what the we don't want
[43:19] to say what the scribes and Pharisees
[43:21] said. That's what they said. If we'd
[43:23] have been back then in the time of our
[43:25] fathers, we wouldn't have slew. we
[43:27] wouldn't have killed or slew slew the
[43:30] prophets. And then Jesus said, "Well,
[43:32] you're the sons. You're the children of
[43:34] the prophets. I children rather of those
[43:36] that killed the prophets." And so it's
[43:38] it's always easy for people to say,
[43:41] "Well, if I'd been back then, it would
[43:43] have been different." But here we are
[43:44] today and we have to put ourselves in
[43:47] the in the scenario of the scripture.
[43:50] And uh some of them at the time of Jesus
[43:54] and I was reading earlier
[43:57] they had the they had the thoughts and
[44:00] the opinions and the opinions I I want
[44:02] to project this in a few moments said
[44:04] he's a good man. Others said he's a
[44:07] prophet. Some said he's a a a great
[44:10] teacher. He's a rabbi.
[44:13] And uh and and others said well he
[44:16] deceives the people. He's a deceiver.
[44:20] And uh and the religious people even
[44:22] called him Bzeub
[44:24] and uh others said at the time of his
[44:27] crucifixion he stirth up the people. So
[44:29] these were all the different uh opinions
[44:33] of the people and and it's not just that
[44:36] people have different thoughts about
[44:38] something but those thoughts then are
[44:41] projected within the individual to how
[44:45] they would receive this person. And I
[44:48] can tell you that all of those opinions
[44:51] which I have described right now did not
[44:55] receive eternal life. They didn't
[44:57] project the people to having faith and
[45:00] believing in Christ. And so their
[45:03] opinions are very important in our time.
[45:08] If you were to read the titles of the
[45:10] messages
[45:12] with this type of ministry that God sent
[45:15] us
[45:17] and you begin to have uh read titles,
[45:21] who do you say this is?
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Who is this?
[45:27] Who is this Melzdc?
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; What will you do with this Jesus called
[45:33] Christ?
[45:35] You don't have to go over very many of
[45:37] the titles before you come to realize
[45:41] this is not merely a different ministry.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; This isn't ministry of people comparing
[45:47] one ministry with another. And it it it
[45:51] actually comes down into this
[45:53] congregation this morning. You know,
[45:56] what will you do with this Jesus called
[45:58] Christ? In other words, what is our
[46:01] opinion of this message?
[46:04] uh is it indeed Christ and if it is
[46:06] Christ uh what does that mean to us and
[46:10] so I want to take it from that uh from
[46:14] that direction
[46:17] uh there's many references as I said a
[46:20] moment ago and applications in the in
[46:23] the scripture and it will help you if I
[46:25] take the first part of the service to to
[46:28] so that you can see how the author who
[46:33] the Holy Spirit is the author. Isn't
[46:36] that correct? The Holy Spirit's the
[46:38] author of the word. So if we can get
[46:40] into the mind of the author
[46:43] &gt;&gt; and see how the word how the how the
[46:45] scripture was structured and and how God
[46:48] looks upon how he was received or what
[46:53] or how he was rejected. It will help us
[46:56] to be able to uh apply it to ourselves
[47:01] to our own life to our own uh our own
[47:04] environment even within our own church.
[47:07] And that's what we're concerned about.
[47:09] There's different events in the Bible,
[47:12] different happenings, different things
[47:14] that took place that involved the
[47:17] receiving where receiving is used. And I
[47:20] might just put it this way real quick.
[47:23] Uh that the ultimate
[47:26] of receiving really takes place when a
[47:30] young man or a man and a woman stand for
[47:34] marriage.
[47:35] And then do you take this man? Not do
[47:39] you just take this man or do you take
[47:42] this woman, but do you take them to be
[47:45] your lawful wed husband or wife? And now
[47:50] we've come to almost like a a supreme
[47:53] aspect of receiving. You're not uh
[47:57] they're not a boyfriend or a girlfriend
[47:59] anymore. We're not in a courtship
[48:01] relationship anymore. We are here to
[48:06] consummate our our love for one another.
[48:10] And we're here to declare, I take this
[48:13] man as my head. I take him as my
[48:17] husband. And and uh you'll have to have
[48:22] a lot of grace as you listen to me this
[48:24] morning because I want to state things
[48:27] that you know, but sometimes aren't very
[48:29] easy to apply. And that is that the
[48:32] spirit of this whole age
[48:34] and this is Satan's Eden.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Correct?
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Satan's Eden. Well, if you go back to
[48:40] Eden, the first thing he did was
[48:43] displace the headship.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; And I want everybody and especially the
[48:49] sisters. I know that some sisters
[48:51] sometimes feel as though they're they're
[48:53] squeezed or what pressured in within the
[48:56] message, but not if you receive it.
[48:58] Amen.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; If you just receive it and husbands must
[49:01] receive it because a lot of times in the
[49:04] husband we say about the wives and the
[49:06] women within this age but many times
[49:08] women are taking the responsibility
[49:11] they're taking because husbands aren't
[49:13] taking it.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; And so there's responsibility on both
[49:17] sides. Husbands are responsible before
[49:21] God to show to display to express to
[49:26] manifest headship
[49:29] &gt;&gt; leadership
[49:30] spiritual leadership that's our
[49:33] responsibility
[49:35] and I often find where women have have
[49:39] you know forged forward they have the
[49:41] hunger for God they have the drive they
[49:45] have the uh you know just a It it seems
[49:48] like such a spiritual thirst after God
[49:51] many times and I'll find a husband more
[49:54] laxidasical about those things. He's
[49:56] occupied with other other things uh that
[50:00] are responsibilities of life and the
[50:02] care and the burdens of the home and so
[50:04] on so forth. And somehow the thing just
[50:06] become it becomes skewed. It becomes
[50:09] just out of out of whack a wee bit. And
[50:13] uh so you can say amen when you want to.
[50:15] I'm not interested in how you say amen
[50:17] or whatever more, but these happen to be
[50:19] the facts in this generation. And that's
[50:22] what happened in Eden. And what happened
[50:25] in Eden in the way of seeds will be in
[50:28] the end time in the way of a harvest.
[50:30] And we I want to say to the
[50:32] congregation, every believer of the
[50:34] message that identifies themselves with
[50:36] the message, let us let us uh vow to
[50:41] ourselves that we are not going to be
[50:44] tainted with the spirit of the world.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Because this is something that is so
[50:49] prevalent in the world and we don't want
[50:52] that to creep into uh our ranks. We
[50:56] don't want it to creep into our
[50:58] thinking. And we want to be able to
[51:00] number one let the husbands take the
[51:03] responsibility
[51:05] for headship. And when uh when when we
[51:08] receive one another as as husbands and
[51:12] wives, then we want to have God's
[51:15] ordained plan.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; God's ordained plan for our home.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Now, that's not where I'm going
[51:24] necessarily, but that is what I want to
[51:28] uh I I want to it it's a big part of the
[51:32] of the service.
[51:34] Now, just to talk about the different
[51:36] degrees or different layers of of
[51:40] receiving, you can have someone come to
[51:42] your door and they might be a might be a
[51:45] neighbor. They might be a stranger and
[51:47] they'll say, "Well, I'd like to, you
[51:48] know, I just want to speak to you about
[51:50] something, you know, of common
[51:51] interest." Oh, well, well, come in. So,
[51:54] you receive them. But then maybe the
[51:57] next time someone comes, it's a family
[51:59] member. Oh, hi. Come on in. Sit down.
[52:02] You know what I mean? So it's a
[52:04] different kind of a reception simply
[52:06] because the person you are seeing you
[52:09] have a different relationship with them.
[52:11] It could be a friend, it could be
[52:13] someone else. And so there's there's
[52:15] that kind of of reception there to
[52:18] receive a a relative or a friend or a
[52:22] guest.
[52:23] We may be given something. Someone comes
[52:26] and says, "Well, I'd like to give you
[52:28] this gift. Uh I I have a special reason.
[52:31] there's a special purpose or intent
[52:33] behind it. I want to give you this. What
[52:35] what do you do? You receive it and you
[52:38] receive it at you should receive it at
[52:40] the level that it's being given to you.
[52:43] Uh it's it's not just uh something
[52:46] that's idle. And uh
[52:51] the Bible says as many as received him.
[52:55] Now there's people who received him as a
[52:57] great teacher. But the Bible says as
[52:59] many as received him to them gave he
[53:02] power.
[53:04] As many as received him, so the degree
[53:07] of reception.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Uh uh that that was that's what what
[53:12] initiated on God's part what he gave.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; And so they received at a certain level.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm interested in that level. I've
[53:22] been pondering this a long time,
[53:24] friends, because I see there's people
[53:26] who come into the message and whoa, it's
[53:29] a wonderful message and maybe they're
[53:31] new things they had never heard before.
[53:33] That does not create within God a desire
[53:37] to give you power to become sons of God.
[53:42] As many as received him, received him
[53:44] how? Received him for what he was?
[53:46] Received him as the thou art the Christ,
[53:49] the son of the living God. They received
[53:52] him as something more than a man, more
[53:54] than a rabbi, more than a good teacher,
[53:57] more than someone who could heal me when
[53:58] I'm sick and make me happy when I'm sad
[54:01] and loose me when I feel bound and take
[54:04] the depression away and be a company of
[54:07] people that I can fellowship with. It's
[54:09] more than that, friends.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; This message is more than that. This
[54:13] message is him. As many as received him,
[54:16] to them gave he power to become the sons
[54:19] of God. This is not merely a church.
[54:21] This is not merely an association of
[54:23] people. This is not just a place where
[54:25] we come and have fellowship. As many as
[54:28] received him, you have to see him in
[54:31] this congregation. You have to see him
[54:33] in the message. You have to see him. And
[54:36] then when you see him and receive him,
[54:39] then you receive power to become sons of
[54:43] God
[54:44] &gt;&gt; and daughters of God.
[54:47] when you're a son and a daughter of God.
[54:49] I have never questioned my identity as a
[54:53] as a son of Fred Biscll. I've never
[54:56] questioned that. There isn't enough
[54:58] There isn't enough that can happen in
[54:59] life to cause me to even have that
[55:03] thought.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; I've never questioned that I'm a son of
[55:09] my father and my mother. I have since
[55:12] I've been a child that thought has never
[55:15] entered my mind. Then if we have been
[55:17] born of the spirit of God, how can it
[55:20] ever enter our mind? Am I a son or am I
[55:22] not a son? Am I a son or am I saved or
[55:25] am I not saved? Once you're born of the
[55:28] spirit of God, that's gone.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; I say it clearly, that's gone. It's gone
[55:33] forever.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; You never come to that place again.
[55:36] Right.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; And if you're coming to that place, then
[55:40] there's something wrong with the
[55:41] receiving.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of voices going
[55:49] through this room. The prophet says, all
[55:51] kinds of voices going through this room
[55:53] right now. And you don't hear them
[55:55] because you haven't got the faculty, the
[55:57] facility to hear them, even though you
[55:58] have ears. But if you had what brother
[56:01] Brandon calls it a crystal and they call
[56:03] it a receiver, a receiving set. If you
[56:07] had a receiving set, the right kind of
[56:10] receiving set, then you'll have you'll
[56:12] have various voices that will come and
[56:15] if you have a selector on there, you'll
[56:16] be able to even select which channel it
[56:19] is or what voice it is and whether you
[56:21] want to hear it or don't want to hear it
[56:22] because it's a receiving set. And as
[56:25] sons and daughters of God, we talk about
[56:27] the predestinated seed of God. If we've
[56:30] been predestinated, then you have a
[56:33] receiving set.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; God can't uh predestinate a son or
[56:37] daughter to himself into his family and
[56:40] then fail to give them the receiving
[56:42] set. You have a receiving set. Every son
[56:46] and daughter of God, everyone has a
[56:49] receiving set
[56:50] &gt;&gt; and it's there to receive him.
[56:54] to identify him,
[56:56] &gt;&gt; to know who he is.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us we love him
[57:05] because he first loved us. That's 1 John
[57:08] 4 and 19. So the act of receiving him
[57:13] entitles a person and gives that person
[57:17] access to the power of God. Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a number of words and I'm
[57:22] going to just go over these if you will
[57:25] give me your attention. I'm going to put
[57:26] them on the screen
[57:28] and uh I want to move as as quickly as I
[57:31] can. So, now if we can perhaps just dim
[57:35] the lights a wee bit.
[57:40] These just happen to be the words that
[57:42] are used in the scripture
[57:44] in the in the Greek and they all have to
[57:47] do with receiving.
[57:53] This is the root word
[57:56] lambeno.
[57:59] And uh lambeno is is essentially to
[58:02] receive
[58:04] or to take with the hand to lay hold of
[58:09] to take what is one's own
[58:12] to take of oneself.
[58:16] Uh to make one's own. So it's something
[58:20] you lay hold of.
[58:22] You take it because it's yours. You take
[58:26] it to make it yours. Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "As many as
[58:31] received him, Lambeno, to them gave he
[58:36] power to become the sons of God, even to
[58:39] them that believe on his name."
[58:44] Uh second word now which I will deal
[58:47] with is perileno
[58:51] which is to receive from another. I'll
[58:54] give you some examples now. to take or
[58:58] it signifies to receive to take with
[59:01] oneself to join to oneself
[59:05] an associate a companion
[59:09] or to accept or acknowledge one to be
[59:11] such as he professes to be.
[59:15] Now when one comes just think now deeply
[59:19] before you read on. If one comes and
[59:24] they profess to be as Jesus did, the son
[59:27] of man,
[59:30] this if if they if they were receiving
[59:32] him at this level, they would receive
[59:36] him
[59:37] at the level that he professes to be.
[59:40] He's the son of man, the son of God,
[59:43] fulfilling, who art thou, John? I'm the
[59:46] voice of one crying in the wilderness.
[59:49] If they received him at the level of
[59:51] peril lambeno, then they received them
[59:55] as he says he is.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; He came unto his own and his own
[1:00:04] received him. Not perileno.
[1:00:07] They did not receive him. Now paraleno
[1:00:10] is not in the negative. It's it's just
[1:00:12] simply saying that they didn't want to
[1:00:14] become an associate of him. They didn't
[1:00:17] receive him for what he said he was.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; He did. They didn't believe that the
[1:00:22] scriptures that were brought forward
[1:00:25] were referring to him. So, they didn't
[1:00:27] receive him. They received him not.
[1:00:31] His own were not willing to accept or
[1:00:34] acknowledge him as he professed to be.
[1:00:38] Then Jesus said, "And if I go and
[1:00:40] prepare a place for you, I will come
[1:00:42] again and receive you unto myself and
[1:00:44] receive you unto myself." Now this is in
[1:00:48] the positive sense. He's not rejecting
[1:00:51] them. He's receiving. I will come again
[1:00:54] and receive you unto myself. Now I just
[1:00:57] I'm I'm jumping way ahead of myself here
[1:01:00] so that you will see where I'm going.
[1:01:02] When Jesus said, "And if I go and
[1:01:05] prepare a place for you, I will come
[1:01:08] again."
[1:01:10] I personally, and I I I don't I won't be
[1:01:14] in my lifetime apologizing over this. I
[1:01:18] am I've been thoroughly convinced for a
[1:01:20] very long time that his that Christ came
[1:01:24] in this message in word form and this
[1:01:26] was the scripture.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; He came. I can find no other purpose for
[1:01:34] him to have sent such a vindicated
[1:01:37] ministry that would say over all of
[1:01:40] these years that's not me. That's him.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; And he's here doing these things.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; That's that that was my voice, but
[1:01:50] that's not me speaking.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; I cannot disassociate those two this
[1:01:58] scripture from that. I will come again.
[1:02:01] And because what was he doing in this
[1:02:04] ministry? He was receiving a people. He
[1:02:08] was calling out a people that he
[1:02:10] declared through that voice that he had
[1:02:13] control of as a bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; So now this is bride time.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; This is not just an association. This is
[1:02:23] not just a church. And that's why the
[1:02:25] messenger the messenger had to scream.
[1:02:28] This is not a denomination.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just that he was
[1:02:32] anti-denominationalism.
[1:02:34] He had to cut the people free of that
[1:02:37] denominational thought. This is not a
[1:02:39] church. This is not a denomination. This
[1:02:42] is not just a fellowship of believers.
[1:02:44] This is a bridegroom speaking
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; and this is a bridegroom calling for his
[1:02:49] bride
[1:02:51] because this has to be the ultimate
[1:02:53] receiving of one another. In other
[1:02:56] words, the people who are called as a
[1:02:58] bride say, "I receive you.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; You are my head.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; What you say, I do.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; What you say, I don't question.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; I am going to be your wife.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to marry you."
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; And when you receive at that level, the
[1:03:19] questions are gone.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Well, did he really mean that? You
[1:03:23] haven't come to be wife yet. Or if
[1:03:24] you're wife, you you you need to get,
[1:03:28] you know, you need to get f more f fully
[1:03:32] convinced.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; So I go to prepare a place and I will
[1:03:37] come again and receive you. Uh perilano,
[1:03:41] I will receive you that where I am there
[1:03:44] ye may be also. I will receive you.
[1:03:46] Perilano, I will receive you for what
[1:03:49] you profess to be. Amen.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; You say that you are a believer
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; and I accept that
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; he understand the prophet standing there
[1:04:01] and person coming and saying do you
[1:04:06] believe that this is him?
[1:04:08] Do you believe that I'm God's servant?
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; They said yes. He say God bless you.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; What did he doing? He is a messenger is
[1:04:19] receiving that individual's
[1:04:21] profession, their confession of what
[1:04:24] they say. I believe
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; brother Derek was led to have you sing
[1:04:31] Lord I believe only believe and that is
[1:04:35] really supreme.
[1:04:38] Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; I will be uh taking these first two
[1:04:45] slides and uh uh speaking more about
[1:04:48] this. Now slide this next one is Anna
[1:04:52] Lambeno is to take up to take to oneself
[1:04:56] to receive. Now these may sound these
[1:04:59] may sound like they're the same. They're
[1:05:01] not the same because to take up. So then
[1:05:04] after the Lord had spoken unto them, he
[1:05:07] was received up. He was taken up into
[1:05:11] heaven and sat on the right hand of God.
[1:05:14] This is not receiving of someone. Now
[1:05:16] he's he's being received up into heaven
[1:05:20] and taken up into and then the scripture
[1:05:22] says in Acts 1:2 until the day in which
[1:05:26] he was taken up analano
[1:05:30] after that he through the Holy Ghost had
[1:05:32] given commandments unto the apostles
[1:05:35] whom he had chosen.
[1:05:38] And then we can go here. This is this
[1:05:41] continues on with scriptures for Anna
[1:05:44] Lambano. And while they looked
[1:05:46] steadfastly towards heaven, he was as he
[1:05:50] went up, behold, two men uh stood by
[1:05:54] them in white raignment. And and while
[1:05:57] they looked steadfastly toward heaven,
[1:05:59] as he went up, this is the same thing
[1:06:03] which also said, "Ye men of Galilee, why
[1:06:07] stand ye gazing up into heaven?" This
[1:06:09] same Jesus which is taken and the word
[1:06:13] taken is analano. He's taken up. He's
[1:06:17] taken from you but he's being received
[1:06:19] at a different level.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; He's taken up from you into heaven and
[1:06:25] so shall come in like manner as ye have
[1:06:28] seen him go into heaven.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; And then we have apple lambano is to
[1:06:35] receive from another. I'm simply going
[1:06:37] through these. As I said there's 19. I'm
[1:06:39] just going through a few to see the
[1:06:41] different levels and different aspects
[1:06:44] of of being received or or how how the
[1:06:48] reception is taken place. And analo
[1:06:52] is to receive from another.
[1:06:56] And uh Luke 16:25, but Abraham said,
[1:07:00] "Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
[1:07:04] receivest you received from another."
[1:07:07] didn't say who it was in this case. But
[1:07:10] you receivest thy good things. Perapano
[1:07:15] the good things and likewise Lazarus
[1:07:17] evil things. But now he is comforted and
[1:07:20] thou art tormented. Luke again 23:41.
[1:07:24] And we indeed justly the thief on the
[1:07:26] cross saying to the other thief, we
[1:07:29] indeed justly for we receive. They
[1:07:33] receive from another. They receive from
[1:07:35] someone else. They receive from the
[1:07:36] court. They receive from the people. We
[1:07:39] justly receive the due reward of our
[1:07:42] deeds. But this man hath done nothing a
[1:07:45] miss. So it has a different application.
[1:07:48] It's a different event. Colossians now
[1:07:51] knowing that of the Lord you shall
[1:07:54] receive the reward of of the
[1:07:56] inheritance. See one who receives an
[1:07:59] inheritance, you didn't necessarily work
[1:08:02] for that inheritance. You didn't earn
[1:08:04] that inheritance. It's not wages you
[1:08:07] received. It's something that's given
[1:08:09] you from another. And how thankful I am
[1:08:12] that there are many scriptures that
[1:08:14] apply. We have received an inheritance.
[1:08:17] We didn't earn this scripture. We didn't
[1:08:20] earn this word of God. We didn't earn
[1:08:22] Malachi 4. We didn't earn this
[1:08:24] revelation. It's been given to us.
[1:08:29] And in the name of Jesus Christ, I want
[1:08:31] you to say, "And I receive it."
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I receive it in the in
[1:08:40] the very depth of the giver.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; He who gave it, he gave it freely. I
[1:08:46] receive it freely. That's why we don't
[1:08:48] have a church where we do all kinds of
[1:08:50] works and things trying to earn it. We
[1:08:52] can't earn it. It's our inheritance.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't it wonderful?
[1:09:10] Pro lamb lambo is to take to oneself.
[1:09:15] Now it's not the giving. It is to take
[1:09:17] to oneself or to receive suggesting a
[1:09:22] welcome. A welcome in this case. Romans
[1:09:26] 15:7.
[1:09:27] Wherefore receive ye one another as
[1:09:30] Christ also received us to the glory of
[1:09:34] God. So now this isn't just a
[1:09:36] relationship between you and God. This
[1:09:38] is how we receive one another.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; We may have a pure heart towards God and
[1:09:45] say, "Oh, I I I know I can't earn it. I
[1:09:48] know this is a free gift. I know that
[1:09:50] you've given it and I receive it and I
[1:09:52] know that this message is none other
[1:09:54] than Jesus Christ." We can have all of
[1:09:56] that in place. But now the same
[1:09:58] scriptures tell us that we have a
[1:10:00] welcoming spirit to one another. Amen.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Then we receive those that Christ has
[1:10:06] received. We welcome those that Christ
[1:10:09] died for this person sitting beside me.
[1:10:12] Hallelujah. And if Christ died for them,
[1:10:15] how shall I receive them? I receive you
[1:10:18] as a brother, as a sister in Christ.
[1:10:21] Indeed.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; And that changes the relationship.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter about their background or
[1:10:30] where they come from. Some come from a
[1:10:32] good home. Some come from a bad home.
[1:10:34] Some come from this country. Some come
[1:10:36] from another country. That has nothing
[1:10:37] to do with it. Jesus Christ has received
[1:10:40] them
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; and they have received him.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And we receive one another.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, that's a great secret,
[1:10:49] friends, that we'll not be able to we'll
[1:10:51] not be able to really plum the depths of
[1:10:53] it here. It's a great mystery. If a
[1:10:56] church could come to the place of
[1:10:58] oneness and unity and love, Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; And we can love one another as Christ
[1:11:04] loved us.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; You'll have a different church.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; You won't have the Cloverdale Bible way
[1:11:10] we're sitting in today. You'll have a
[1:11:12] different church.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; You won't have the atmosphere of the
[1:11:15] world. I live in my little corner. You
[1:11:17] live in your little corner. We never
[1:11:19] pass only in the in in in the church
[1:11:21] aisle. No, it's not that way. We we can
[1:11:24] chew the same gum.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Have fellowship.
[1:11:31] Glory.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Not fellowship at the level of the world
[1:11:35] where we just eat together and drink
[1:11:37] together, but fellowship.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Come over to my home and take your shoes
[1:11:42] off and help yourself to the fridge. And
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; you want to be careful if it's just a
[1:11:50] bunch of young men that helping
[1:11:51] themselves to the fridge.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; But you get my point.
[1:12:03] Metal lambeno.
[1:12:06] It's to make a partner, to be made a
[1:12:08] partner,
[1:12:10] to partake of something as in food of a
[1:12:15] uh or of a thing. In Acts 2 and 46, and
[1:12:19] they continuing daily with one accord in
[1:12:22] the temple and breaking bread from house
[1:12:25] to house did eat their meat with
[1:12:27] gladness and singleness of heart.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; They were continuing daily from in one
[1:12:32] accord.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. In 1 Timothy 2:6 says, "The
[1:12:37] husbandman that labor must first be
[1:12:40] partaker of the fruits." He must be a
[1:12:43] partaker. He must receive. He must
[1:12:45] receive the the husbandman or in this
[1:12:48] case I'll say even the minister the
[1:12:50] preacher before I can come here and seek
[1:12:52] to give out for you to receive. I first
[1:12:56] have to had to receive it.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; I have to labor and sometimes I can
[1:13:01] guarantee you labor a lot more than
[1:13:03] you're laboring to receive it. I have to
[1:13:05] labor and how how can I convey this? and
[1:13:08] and and I just begin. You know how it
[1:13:10] starts with the minister just to
[1:13:12] receive, receive, receive, receive.
[1:13:17] Yeah, I received him. And as many as
[1:13:20] received him. That's the first one that
[1:13:22] came. The other one, the second one that
[1:13:24] came was, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[1:13:27] Not, "Would you like it?"
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Not this is an option.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Receive ye the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:37] Hallelujah.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; And when you receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; you don't go on wondering all the rest
[1:13:43] of your life, have I got it? Haven't I
[1:13:45] got it? I wonder, do I have it? Things
[1:13:47] are going bad. I must not have it.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; I feel real low. I mustn't have it. The
[1:13:52] scripture says this. The scripture says
[1:13:55] this.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Repent.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Have you repented?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; And be baptized. Have you been baptized?
[1:14:03] You shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:14:07] Ghost.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; That's not my word. That's his word.
[1:14:10] That's not just printed in a book.
[1:14:12] That's God said that.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; You shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:14:17] Ghost.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; So the husbandman, he must first he
[1:14:26] labors in the word and and and these
[1:14:30] things don't come easy. This isn't
[1:14:31] something that, you know, that I put
[1:14:33] together or whatever more. I have to let
[1:14:36] God deal
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; with my own heart.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; And I have to see these things and
[1:14:42] receive them
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; as having come from God. Didn't come
[1:14:46] from a textbook. Didn't come from a
[1:14:47] school of theology. Didn't come from a
[1:14:49] Bible school. If there's anything I
[1:14:51] refer to, I will refer to what the
[1:14:54] prophet of God, a vindicated word, has
[1:14:57] said on these various subjects. And I
[1:14:59] receive that.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; So we can come here and give it and yet
[1:15:04] you can receive it.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Metal Lambeno.
[1:15:12] Another scripture that refers to that
[1:15:14] which isn't on the screen. For the earth
[1:15:17] which drinkketh in the rain that cometh
[1:15:19] loft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs,
[1:15:23] meat for them by whom it is dressed,
[1:15:27] receiveth blessing from God. The earth
[1:15:31] receives blessing from didn't earn it,
[1:15:33] doesn't know anything, doesn't have the
[1:15:35] knowledge we have about it, but it
[1:15:37] receives uh it receives metal lambeno.
[1:15:41] And then there's hupo lambeno. I can't
[1:15:44] say that I'm saying all of these exactly
[1:15:46] right, but you have grace.
[1:15:50] It is to take or to bear up, which is
[1:15:54] from the hupo part. That's from under to
[1:15:59] receive is rendered received as in Acts
[1:16:03] 1 and9. And when they had spoken these
[1:16:08] things, while they beheld, he was taken
[1:16:12] up, and a cloud received him out of
[1:16:16] their sight.
[1:16:19] And then here's a one that I won't try
[1:16:23] to to pronounce too much, but this is
[1:16:26] the third one that I want to emphasize.
[1:16:28] Lambeno
[1:16:30] uh
[1:16:33] paraleno
[1:16:35] and then
[1:16:36] this one here deca oh deca oh
[1:16:42] is to receive by deliberate
[1:16:46] and ready reception
[1:16:48] of what is offered.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; You don't try and adjust what is being
[1:16:53] offered. You don't try to remanufacture
[1:16:55] it. You don't try to redesign it. You
[1:17:00] accept and you receive it by a
[1:17:03] deliberate and ready reception of what
[1:17:07] is offered. And uh whosoever shall not
[1:17:11] receive you.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Nor hear your words when you depart out
[1:17:18] of that house or city. Shake off the
[1:17:21] dust off your feet. He that receiveth
[1:17:24] you receiveth me.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; And this is deci. He that receiveth you
[1:17:32] receiveth you with a deliberate and
[1:17:35] ready reception
[1:17:37] receiveth me. And he that receiveth me
[1:17:41] receiveth him that sent me.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; This is a direct link to almighty God.
[1:17:53] You know when you hear something over
[1:17:54] the pulpit
[1:17:57] it really becomes serious in this light
[1:18:00] in the light of this scripture.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Is this God or is it a man?
[1:18:06] Is it something that was taken up out of
[1:18:08] you know some thoughts or some personal
[1:18:12] convictions or whatever more and perhaps
[1:18:14] there is those I I don't say that
[1:18:16] everything that comes over the pulpit is
[1:18:18] you know divinely orchestrated from
[1:18:20] almighty god I can't say that but I can
[1:18:23] tell you that I need to have confidence
[1:18:25] and you certainly need to have
[1:18:26] confidence of men who stand behind the
[1:18:29] pull pit you have to have absolute
[1:18:31] confidence
[1:18:33] you know why I'm preaching This
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; one of the plagues
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; in the message today is that they're not
[1:18:39] receiving him who sent that message.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; They are not receiving it in the
[1:18:47] fullness. Think, well, they put a
[1:18:49] question out. You know, what is there?
[1:18:51] What what is your absolute? My absolute,
[1:18:55] I'll tell you what, some say, well, that
[1:18:56] was just Brother Brandham's opinion. I
[1:18:59] sooner have his opinion than someone
[1:19:01] else's uh what they think is their
[1:19:03] doctrine.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Somebody who God
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; God knows when he stand up and say, "I'm
[1:19:12] going to go fishing." Well, praise God.
[1:19:14] God's happy that he's going fishing,
[1:19:16] he's going to talk to him out there.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; He said they even, you know, he had
[1:19:21] people that would uh uh discredit him
[1:19:24] because he go, "What's he doing going
[1:19:26] hunting?" Hey, it was while he was
[1:19:28] hunting that I got the revelation.
[1:19:32] It was while he was hunting, Brother Bud
[1:19:34] Southwick was born again. And that's
[1:19:36] worth 10,000 worlds. And Jesus Christ
[1:19:40] died for that man and is sending his
[1:19:42] messenger to get one man.
[1:19:46] I'm glad he came my way. I'm glad he
[1:19:49] came your way.
[1:19:51] And as a congregation, let's rejoice by
[1:19:54] saying, "And I receive him.
[1:19:58] I receive it.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I receive it in the spirit. It was
[1:20:02] given.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; I receive it in the spirit of the giver.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; And when we get something in the message
[1:20:12] and we feel kind of squeezed and we feel
[1:20:14] kind of squirmed and we try to want to
[1:20:17] figure a way around it, stop right
[1:20:19] there.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Remember that's our husband.
[1:20:25] That's our husband.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; You know I the word headship if you
[1:20:37] brothers and sisters you have a search
[1:20:39] program you'll find that the word
[1:20:42] headship
[1:20:44] is in I think 32 paragraphs
[1:20:47] some paragraphs he uses the word a
[1:20:50] number of times in just one paragraph.
[1:20:53] headship.
[1:20:56] If you have received him for who he is
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; and you say this is the living Christ,
[1:21:03] he revealed himself. What did he reveal
[1:21:06] himself? He revealed himself as our
[1:21:08] husband.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Not just our bridegroom but our husband.
[1:21:13] And that is why when when the prophet
[1:21:15] came towards the end of his ministry and
[1:21:17] one of the most outstanding of all
[1:21:19] messages is Christ is the mystery of God
[1:21:23] revealed.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; And when he becomes revealed then we
[1:21:26] understand and brother Brandham uses the
[1:21:29] word headship 16 times in that service
[1:21:33] in that one service. not 16 paragraphs
[1:21:36] but 16 times he uses the word and I
[1:21:38] think about 11 paragraphs out of 32 in
[1:21:41] the entire ministry of his entire entire
[1:21:44] ministry over all of these years from 47
[1:21:47] we have recorded to 65 he uses the word
[1:21:50] headship in I think 32 paragraphs and 16
[1:21:54] or or 11 of those paragraphs are in in
[1:21:58] Christ as the mystery of God revealed.
[1:22:00] Go home and read that and every time you
[1:22:03] hit headship, just highlight it.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; What's he doing
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; before he sends a messenger away to his
[1:22:11] reward? He wants to let the bride know
[1:22:14] headship has returned.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to prepare a place. He's going
[1:22:22] to prepare a place for his bride. He's
[1:22:25] going to prepare a place for you. And if
[1:22:28] I go to prepare a place, I will come
[1:22:31] again. But he doesn't come back as the
[1:22:34] lowly Nazarene. He doesn't come back to
[1:22:36] carry a cross to Calvary. He comes back
[1:22:39] as husband.
[1:22:42] And that's why the prophet talks about
[1:22:45] the son of the rancher, the man that has
[1:22:47] the great ranch in Chicago. He doesn't
[1:22:49] come down there to clean the barns. He
[1:22:52] comes down there looking for a wife. And
[1:22:55] he's coming down looking for character.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; You may not have a lot of things in this
[1:23:00] world. I might not have mental
[1:23:02] retention. I may not have a whole lot of
[1:23:05] character, a whole lot of things. But
[1:23:07] one thing we have is we have the kind of
[1:23:10] character he's looking for. He just
[1:23:12] wants somebody to believe him.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; He just wants somebody to love him.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; And he that hears you
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; hears me. And he that hears me hears my
[1:23:26] father. You have a direct link with God
[1:23:29] Almighty.
[1:23:31] That's not my words. That's his words.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; That's the Bible.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; And you are living in the era of
[1:23:39] headship.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet came with church
[1:23:45] order. He came with church order because
[1:23:48] he was speaking on behalf of the head of
[1:23:50] the church.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; To the church.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Headship.
[1:23:58] [Applause]
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; That's why he talked about the home,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; the family.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Headship.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Children, your father and mother is
[1:24:09] headship.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And to the wife, your husband is
[1:24:13] headship. And to you husbands, let it be
[1:24:16] a revelation. That's a serious and a
[1:24:19] very deep responsibility.
[1:24:21] Headship.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; I'm responsible to give an example to
[1:24:25] these children that God has. I'm
[1:24:28] responsible to give a spiritual example
[1:24:30] to my wife.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; We all fail,
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; but we want to be remembered for the
[1:24:42] main things.
[1:24:48] My wife said to me this last week
[1:24:54] and she doesn't know I'm going to say
[1:24:56] this and it's not going to embarrassment
[1:24:58] to her because we fail in a lot of
[1:25:01] things. We may fail as husbands, as men,
[1:25:05] as a brother,
[1:25:07] as a father.
[1:25:09] If I could go back and relive my life as
[1:25:12] a father, I'd probably do a lot of
[1:25:14] things different. And so would all of
[1:25:16] us.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; And there'd be little spots that we'd
[1:25:21] erase out.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; And as husbands,
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; as men, as brother in the church,
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; as a minister, there'd be all kinds of
[1:25:32] things we'd like to rearrange and
[1:25:33] change, but we want to be remembered for
[1:25:36] the main thing.
[1:25:38] Yes.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; My wife said one thing about you. She
[1:25:41] said you have always loved the word of
[1:25:44] God.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, all I want now I now
[1:25:50] she said that now when one day all I
[1:25:53] want to do is hear hear whatever
[1:25:56] language or whatever sound it is or
[1:25:58] whatever what whatever however it is in
[1:26:02] eternity or in the millennium.
[1:26:04] I want to hear his words.
[1:26:07] Yeah.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; But you have always loved me.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And when I showed myself to you,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; you loved me.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You maybe fell, maybe you did
[1:26:23] something wrong, you said something
[1:26:24] wrong, but you loved me.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And that's what counts.
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:33] Yes, sir.
[1:26:51] This is following along the same on the
[1:26:54] same same word.
[1:26:56] He that receiveth a prophet, he that dec
[1:27:07] he that receiveth a prophet
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; in the name of a prophet
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; shall receive a prophet's reward.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; And he that receiveth a righteous man
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; in the name of a righteous man shall
[1:27:22] receive a righteous man's reward. Think
[1:27:25] of it friends. Somebody just receives a
[1:27:28] righteous man in and and at this level
[1:27:31] they receive it with a deliberate
[1:27:34] and uh a ready reception
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; of what is being offered. And maybe
[1:27:40] maybe the man isn't preaching a message
[1:27:42] but he's just living a life. And I've
[1:27:44] used this example before and allow me
[1:27:46] just to use I've used it mostly in
[1:27:48] private conversation. But perhaps one
[1:27:51] man because brother Vanom says in the
[1:27:53] church ages he says that there will be
[1:27:55] some who will receive eternal life
[1:27:58] because they've been good to the bride.
[1:28:01] I had I had a lot of trouble with that
[1:28:04] because the scripture right away, you
[1:28:05] know, come in my mind there the the only
[1:28:09] by the remission of sin. By the shedding
[1:28:11] of blood is the remission of sin. And
[1:28:14] and I see now brother Brandham say and
[1:28:16] brother Brandham says he can show
[1:28:18] scriptures for that. But in my reading
[1:28:20] of the church ages, I never saw where he
[1:28:22] actually pointed out to the scripture.
[1:28:24] But one day, in fact is I'm I'm probably
[1:28:28] thankful he didn't go to the scripture
[1:28:29] because one day the Holy Spirit just
[1:28:33] illuminated me. And when he does it by
[1:28:35] revelation, nothing ever take it away.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; And I was I was in some other country,
[1:28:39] some other place. I was kneeling at my
[1:28:41] little cot and I was reading the
[1:28:43] scripture and I I started to read this
[1:28:45] scripture. And he that receiveth
[1:28:49] a righteous man in the name of a
[1:28:52] righteous man, the name is his life.
[1:28:54] That's his manifestation. That's the way
[1:28:56] that he lived. The name, your name isn't
[1:28:59] just, you know, my name's not just Ed
[1:29:00] Biscll. It's what it's what I did in
[1:29:02] life. Your name is what you are, who you
[1:29:05] are, what you are, your association,
[1:29:08] your beliefs, your all of those things.
[1:29:10] That's who you are. That's your name.
[1:29:12] That's why we're called by a new name.
[1:29:14] That's why Abraham had to had to have
[1:29:17] his name changed because he was going to
[1:29:19] have a whole new life. He the old name
[1:29:22] couldn't bring forth Isaac. So, he had
[1:29:23] his name changed and brought forth a
[1:29:25] son. You understand? And so, I was just
[1:29:28] reading this scripture and uh wasn't in
[1:29:32] any particular uh message. And he that
[1:29:34] receiveth the righteous man, and I just
[1:29:36] got that far, and the Holy Spirit spoke
[1:29:38] as clear as I'm speaking to you, says,
[1:29:40] "He that receiveth a righteous man in
[1:29:42] the name of a righteous man receives a
[1:29:43] righteous man's reward." And the Holy
[1:29:46] Spirit just said, "What is a righteous
[1:29:47] man's reward?"
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; And I answered myself. I even answered
[1:29:51] it. I said, "Eternal life." And then
[1:29:54] that it exploded. He that receiveth a
[1:29:58] righteous man in the name not not the
[1:30:02] man's sermon. The man's sermon was his
[1:30:05] life.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; He lived the life. And so I've used this
[1:30:09] example. So you know uh the farmer John
[1:30:13] is on one side of the street and his
[1:30:15] maybe his friend Carl is on the other
[1:30:17] side of the street and one's a Holy
[1:30:19] Ghost believer of the message and just
[1:30:21] affirm he you know he honors God in all
[1:30:24] of his life and so on. And the man
[1:30:26] across the street, John, says to his
[1:30:27] wife, he says, 'You know,
[1:30:30] I'm not religious. I I've just I've
[1:30:33] never gone to church. I'm not religious
[1:30:35] at all, and I don't know anything about
[1:30:37] religion, but if there is a God, Carl's
[1:30:40] God is God.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; That man, he lives a life. I wish I
[1:30:46] could live like him.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; He's a He's a He's a He if there is
[1:30:50] Christians, he's a Christian.
[1:30:52] If there ever was a God, his God is God.
[1:30:55] And so he says to Carl, "Hey, you know,
[1:30:58] your tractors broke down. Use mine." You
[1:31:01] said, "Go ahead, use mine." And he just
[1:31:03] can't do enough for him. What is he
[1:31:05] doing? What's he seen? He actually seen
[1:31:08] Christ
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; in the man
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; and he's receiving his Christ.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; He is receiving Christ and he's
[1:31:14] believing on that Christ. He believes in
[1:31:17] him and he maybe tells his wife or even
[1:31:19] tells the friends or tells the community
[1:31:21] that man is a Christian.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know about the rest of these
[1:31:25] church people, but this man is a
[1:31:27] Christian.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; And if I and if I was going to be a
[1:31:29] believer, I' I'd believe what he
[1:31:31] believes.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; And in his heart, he's actually he's
[1:31:34] actually receiving that Christ.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; And God is so honored. He says, "Well,
[1:31:42] what I am, I gave to Christ. And what I
[1:31:44] what I poured into Christ was poured
[1:31:46] into his church and that was poured into
[1:31:48] Carl. And this man believes on him.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; That just happens to be my own thought.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; and if you will receive it, this was
[1:32:03] Elias which was for to come.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. if you will, if you will with
[1:32:07] deliberate
[1:32:08] uh um movement and belief, take a hold
[1:32:11] of it and if you'll receive it. So now I
[1:32:15] say to this congregation, you young
[1:32:16] people, you need to know, we say, well,
[1:32:19] Malachi 4, Malachi 4, all this, you
[1:32:21] know, turn the hearts of the children,
[1:32:24] is that a revelation to you? Is that
[1:32:26] come as a reality to you? So that it
[1:32:29] it's you've been confronted by it that
[1:32:31] you've actually been confronted by it.
[1:32:33] Listen to me young people. Malachi 4 has
[1:32:36] to be something more than a scripture in
[1:32:37] the Bible. Malachi 4 was a person, a man
[1:32:40] who came and lived and fulfilled that
[1:32:43] scripture and you have it has to come as
[1:32:45] a revelation to you and you reach out
[1:32:48] with a deliberate hand and take a hold
[1:32:50] of it and pull it into yourself and say,
[1:32:52] "I believe that
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; and I receive that
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; and I receive what he says
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; and I receive." He said it'll turn the
[1:33:02] heart back to the back to the the faith
[1:33:04] of the fathers. Now I can receive that.
[1:33:07] I believe that that word will turn me
[1:33:10] back.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And you want to get into that message.
[1:33:13] You want to see what he said because
[1:33:15] what he said is going to turn you back.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; And you'll start seeing your life
[1:33:24] change. You can't change it. He changes
[1:33:27] it.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Because what are you receiving? You're
[1:33:30] receiving him.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; And to them that received him gave he
[1:33:35] power to become the sons of God. You
[1:33:38] didn't pull the power down. You just
[1:33:41] received.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And just by receiving, you get it.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "How do I get the
[1:33:49] Holy Ghost?" Just receive him.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Receive him in his fullness. Receive him
[1:33:54] in all that he said. Whatever you said,
[1:33:57] I don't understand it. I believe it.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; This is a brainwashing. No, it's a
[1:34:11] husband.
[1:34:14] [Applause]
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Like somebody say to some woman, "Why do
[1:34:18] you do that? I think that's ridiculous.
[1:34:21] My husband likes me to do it.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; My husband wants me to dress this way.
[1:34:30] Hallelujah.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; All you sisters don't cook the same
[1:34:35] thing,
[1:34:37] but you cook what your family likes. You
[1:34:40] cook what your husband wants.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; And I didn't expect to get that quiet,
[1:34:45] but anyway.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; It works better.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] And by faith the harlot Rahab perished
[1:35:01] not with them that believed. Try to take
[1:35:04] this one in, friends.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Here's a whole city that's under the
[1:35:08] judgment of God and the whole place is
[1:35:11] going to collapse and the walls are
[1:35:14] going to fall. And this woman, a harlot,
[1:35:17] who's just received men in harlotry, she
[1:35:20] said uh that and she and by faith the
[1:35:23] harlot Rahab or Rahab perished not with
[1:35:27] them that believe not when she had when
[1:35:30] she had received the spies with peace.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; And she wasn't agitated and all nervous
[1:35:37] and say, "Oh, I'm afraid if I if I say
[1:35:39] if I say the wrong thing, they're going
[1:35:40] to kill me." No, no. She just had a
[1:35:43] quiet rest. She had a quiet peace
[1:35:46] because that's what that word receiving.
[1:35:48] When she received them in peace
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; and when she received them, she was
[1:35:54] already saved.
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; The cord wasn't in the window.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; The scarlet cord wasn't in the window
[1:36:03] yet.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; They hadn't marched around the walls.
[1:36:06] The armies hadn't even come. I tell you
[1:36:09] what, friends, you can have you can have
[1:36:11] peace and absolute confidence in your
[1:36:14] heart before the attack of the enemy
[1:36:16] ever comes.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Before the army, before the destruction
[1:36:24] ever comes, you can have peace.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; They She received the spies with peace.
[1:36:32] She received them.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the depth of faith in the
[1:36:38] simple act of receiving the depth of
[1:36:41] your faith anchored in the in the simple
[1:36:44] act of receiving
[1:36:46] whether it be the spies or whether it be
[1:36:50] somebody who can hardly preach or
[1:36:52] whether it be your pastor or a minister
[1:36:56] or whoever
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; but you are confident that has been sent
[1:37:02] to me by God
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; and I receive it.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, the receiving of it. And you know
[1:37:07] the beautiful thing about receiving?
[1:37:11] The youngest and the eldest that are
[1:37:13] here know all about it
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; right
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; now. the mutual giving or receiving,
[1:37:26] giving and receiving of each other
[1:37:30] until the reality that the two are one.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; That kind of receiving is a depth that
[1:37:37] this message is all about.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; That's why we call this a bride message
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; because it is an ultimate reception and
[1:37:45] receiving and giving of one another.
[1:37:48] Christ so freely gave himself to us. Now
[1:37:52] the scripture says, "Wherefore they are
[1:37:55] no more twain but one flesh."
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; And what therefore God hath joined
[1:38:01] together, let no man put aunder.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the Pergeamian,
[1:38:08] excuse me, Pergamanian church age,
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; he said, "Notice the harmony.
[1:38:15] Amen.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Okay, we can just put the lights up for
[1:38:19] a moment. I I will come to another I
[1:38:23] have three I think two or three more
[1:38:25] slides.
[1:38:27] Notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:38:30] son.
[1:38:32] Jesus never did anything.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Until it was first showed him by the
[1:38:37] father. How many times brother Brandham
[1:38:39] referred to that?
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; He never did anything. The reason he was
[1:38:43] saying that was because he was trying to
[1:38:46] tell the people and trying to tell us, I
[1:38:48] don't do anything till I see a vision.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; People wanted him to go here and go
[1:38:54] there and fly overseas and lay hands and
[1:38:57] raise this child from the dead and do
[1:38:59] all you did it there, you can do it for
[1:39:01] me. But he couldn't do it. But when that
[1:39:03] vision came
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; and then he obeyed that vision,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; if the hat was supposed to be on the
[1:39:09] bed, it wasn't on the bed yet. He waited
[1:39:10] till somebody put the hat on the bed. He
[1:39:13] couldn't put the hat on the bed.
[1:39:15] Somebody it had to happen in and and
[1:39:18] sovereignly. And when you know that
[1:39:20] something sovereignly happens, friends,
[1:39:22] just mark it down.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Put it in your script bag. That's the
[1:39:26] way it is. God has done it.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, that's the way I believe
[1:39:33] and that's the way this church has
[1:39:35] conducted all the years of the missions.
[1:39:37] When God opens a door, there's been
[1:39:40] other places, other times, and I've seen
[1:39:42] maybe there's greater needs in other
[1:39:44] places, but until God opens the door,
[1:39:46] but when he opens a door and you go
[1:39:49] through that door, then you have
[1:39:51] confidence you're being led by the
[1:39:54] author of this message and he's got
[1:39:56] somebody in there, somebody in that
[1:39:58] country, whatever more that wants this
[1:40:01] message.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we were in India over 30
[1:40:06] years and and you you probably wouldn't
[1:40:09] know how this start started. I was on
[1:40:12] the way, brother Lonnie Jenkins coming
[1:40:14] from one direction, I coming from
[1:40:15] another direction. We were going to
[1:40:17] Norway, which we we spoke that
[1:40:19] convention Norway I think 13 years, 13
[1:40:22] different times.
[1:40:24] And uh and uh one brother in Sweden, he
[1:40:27] said he said, "Could you just come, you
[1:40:31] know, maybe come a few days early and
[1:40:33] come into Sweden? We're just a few
[1:40:35] people, but we've never had a we've
[1:40:37] never had a meeting. If you come there,
[1:40:39] maybe we'd have a meeting because there
[1:40:40] are some of the people, sisters, maybe
[1:40:42] elder people that can't get over here to
[1:40:44] Norway. If you could stop stop there."
[1:40:48] So we arrived in Oslo and one brother
[1:40:50] took me up there. Brother Lonnie arrived
[1:40:53] with another person and and uh uh we got
[1:40:56] assigned to our rooms etc. and and there
[1:40:59] was a a man from India that was there
[1:41:02] spoke very very good English and he came
[1:41:05] with a a school teacher from Germany
[1:41:07] from Crayfeld Germany and they brought
[1:41:10] him up there to to Sweden to this
[1:41:13] meeting
[1:41:15] and uh once again I was in prayer a
[1:41:18] couple days into the meeting I was in
[1:41:20] prayer and I felt a voice within me
[1:41:24] saying go to that go to brother Daniel's
[1:41:28] room and I knew that he and this school
[1:41:32] teacher were together all the time. They
[1:41:34] came into service together, left
[1:41:36] together, ate together, whatever more
[1:41:38] because I think maybe the other brother
[1:41:40] was doing some interpreting for him. I
[1:41:42] don't know. So
[1:41:44] I I I once again I just said, "Lord, if
[1:41:47] this is you, when I get to his room,
[1:41:50] he'll be alone."
[1:41:52] So I got up from my bed. And I walked
[1:41:53] down to another building and entered the
[1:41:55] door and knocked on the door and I just
[1:41:58] heard come in. And so I opened the door
[1:42:01] and here's here's this Indian man uh
[1:42:04] from India sitting on his bed looking at
[1:42:08] a a book. So I said, "How are you,
[1:42:10] brother Daniel?" He was alone. I said,
[1:42:13] "Well," he said, "I'm just looking at
[1:42:15] some pictures of home." Oh, I see. He
[1:42:18] was real melancholy
[1:42:20] and uh yeah he said I'm just so I said
[1:42:26] how you know how did you get here
[1:42:30] and he said well he said um I arrived in
[1:42:34] Germany to visit a minister that had
[1:42:36] invited me but apparently wasn't
[1:42:39] convenient. He didn't know what to do
[1:42:40] with me. So he just called a man in his
[1:42:43] congregation who was free and said, you
[1:42:46] know, take him, you know, take him
[1:42:47] someplace. So he said, we went to
[1:42:50] Belgium. Uh but there was
[1:42:54] uh the man couldn't see me. The man
[1:42:56] who's kind of caring for the work, he
[1:42:58] couldn't see me. And so they said,
[1:43:00] "Well, you know, take him up to uh
[1:43:06] Norway, but not Norway because they
[1:43:08] didn't want him to meet me.
[1:43:13] You know, we have friends and then we
[1:43:15] have friends." But anyway,
[1:43:19] so this man didn't want this Indian
[1:43:22] brother to meet me. So he said, "Well,
[1:43:24] there's a convention nor Norway, so
[1:43:26] don't take him there. take them to
[1:43:27] Sweden.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; You know, God's got a sense of humor.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; And here they are, 30, 40 people maybe
[1:43:34] gathered in in in Sweden. And we arrived
[1:43:37] there and he's a total stranger. I
[1:43:39] haven't said anything. I I don't even
[1:43:40] know if I shook his hand. And and I sat
[1:43:43] down there. As a result of those few
[1:43:46] minutes in Sweden, the whole work in
[1:43:49] India started.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why don't you come?" I said,
[1:43:55] 'Well, are there any messages? No. He
[1:43:57] said, 'We haven't we haven't got any
[1:43:59] messages translated in in the Telugu
[1:44:01] language. And I said, 'Well, you know,
[1:44:04] are there believers? Well, yeah. He
[1:44:06] says, we we've heard about and I tried
[1:44:08] to get the people here in Germany to
[1:44:10] help us translate, but he said, well,
[1:44:11] you all speak English, they said. So, he
[1:44:14] said, so translation didn't happen. And
[1:44:18] uh he said then the same minister wanted
[1:44:21] me to translate his messages in Telugu.
[1:44:24] I said well why should I translate your
[1:44:27] messages in Telugu? I haven't translated
[1:44:29] brother Brandham's messages in Telugu
[1:44:31] yet. But it's this man had this ministry
[1:44:35] had more importance on his message than
[1:44:38] the prophet's message.
[1:44:40] And so the very next I think it was the
[1:44:43] very next November I was uh in India and
[1:44:47] I tell you what friends I need to write
[1:44:49] a book. I need to write a book. I'll
[1:44:52] just tell you this much about it. So I'm
[1:44:55] I'm I'm trying to make connections to go
[1:44:59] uh to Bombay and then I have to get a
[1:45:02] train for 12 hours and then he's going
[1:45:05] to meet me. This Daniel's going to meet
[1:45:07] me and take me to a city called
[1:45:10] Rajamandri.
[1:45:11] Rajamundry has a million people.
[1:45:14] There isn't a restaurant there that
[1:45:16] you'd ever eat in.
[1:45:19] There isn't a hotel that you would stay
[1:45:21] in. I guarantee you. And uh this is my
[1:45:25] first first time.
[1:45:28] So I call Air Canada. I'm not I'm not
[1:45:31] getting away from my message now. Do we
[1:45:32] have a little bit of time? Okay. So I
[1:45:35] call Air Canada and and I I want to make
[1:45:39] a flight to Bombay from Vancouver to
[1:45:42] London to Bombay
[1:45:45] and uh a few of you have heard Smatters
[1:45:47] about this but I'll just tell you and so
[1:45:52] they said well we can get you to London
[1:45:55] but the flights are all booked to
[1:45:57] Bombay.
[1:45:59] So I said well you know when can I go?
[1:46:01] Oh they said they're booked for about 3
[1:46:03] months. Oh my goodness. I said, "Well,
[1:46:08] uh, can I go to London and then go on
[1:46:12] standby?"
[1:46:14] No, because we cannot, uh, we cannot
[1:46:17] send your bag through to Bombay. Your
[1:46:20] bag would come off and then you'd have
[1:46:21] to pick your bag off and recheck and
[1:46:23] then on. So that took the standby part
[1:46:26] off.
[1:46:28] And so I said, "Well, I was so
[1:46:30] desperate." So I said if I called
[1:46:32] British Airways
[1:46:34] and they allowed me to go on standby
[1:46:37] because there's no standby on that
[1:46:39] flight to Bombay. I said if they allowed
[1:46:41] me to go on standby
[1:46:43] would would you then send my bag
[1:46:46] through? We hadn't had 9/11 yet. So they
[1:46:50] said, "Yeah, yeah, we'll we'll send your
[1:46:52] bag through if you if they say you'll go
[1:46:55] on standby." So I called over to London.
[1:46:58] There was only one of three people at
[1:47:00] the at that particular trans transit
[1:47:02] desk. And I said, "Air Canada will send
[1:47:06] me my bag through to Bombay if you'll
[1:47:08] let me go on standby there." And it was
[1:47:10] a very nice gentleman. He said, "Yeah,
[1:47:12] okay." He said, "I'll be here and uh you
[1:47:15] can go on standby."
[1:47:18] So I flew over, sent my bag on to
[1:47:20] Bombay. And I I got there and I went up
[1:47:24] to the desk. I I had six hours to wait.
[1:47:27] So I got there, went up to the transit
[1:47:29] desk and I said, I'm here on standby for
[1:47:31] the Bombay flight. Oh, they said, so
[1:47:34] they looked at the list. Okay. I said,
[1:47:36] 'What number am I? Said, you're number
[1:47:38] five. Oh, good. I felt real good. Said,
[1:47:41] just come back, you know, maybe 35
[1:47:43] minutes or so ahead of the flight and uh
[1:47:46] so fine. I waited till about 1 hour
[1:47:48] before the flight and then I went up and
[1:47:49] there now the staff had changed. There
[1:47:51] was a lady there and and I said, "Uh,
[1:47:53] Mr. Biscll, uh, what number am I now on
[1:47:56] the standby list? And she said, uh, 32.
[1:48:00] I said, excuse me. I said, I was five. I
[1:48:04] was number five about 4 hours ago. No,
[1:48:06] she said, there's been others who are
[1:48:08] have different kind of ticket, different
[1:48:10] level of ticketing, and so you just got
[1:48:12] bumped because you were on a special low
[1:48:14] ticket and you just get bumped down. Oh.
[1:48:17] And she said, doesn't look very good.
[1:48:18] She said in fact is she said you should
[1:48:20] be going out to the main terminal and
[1:48:22] get yourself a hotel.
[1:48:26] I said well my bag is going through now.
[1:48:29] She said
[1:48:31] you know you should have thought of that
[1:48:32] ahead of time.
[1:48:35] I said okay. She said well if you want
[1:48:37] you know just you can wait here and come
[1:48:38] here about 25 minutes before the flight.
[1:48:41] So, I waited and I came up to her about
[1:48:44] 25 minutes before the flight and she
[1:48:47] said, "No, the flight's completely
[1:48:49] booked and everyone is everyone is
[1:48:51] already checked in and the and the
[1:48:53] flight's totally booked." So, she said,
[1:48:55] "Just go into the passageway and turn
[1:48:57] right and uh that'll take you to the
[1:49:00] main terminal. You get a hotel." I said,
[1:49:02] "What happens to my bag? How will I ever
[1:49:04] find my bag?" Said, "Mr. Biscll, I'm
[1:49:06] sorry. I can't do a thing about it." She
[1:49:08] said, "You know, uh, Air Canada should
[1:49:11] have told you about that."
[1:49:13] So, I walked away and I went into the
[1:49:16] passageway and I was just turning right
[1:49:18] and I and a voice.
[1:49:21] Well, I'm so glad that voice says, "No,
[1:49:24] go down and try." No, God even knows
[1:49:27] English.
[1:49:30] Said, "Go down and try." And so, I
[1:49:32] wheeled around real quick and I had to
[1:49:34] look over her to make sure she wasn't
[1:49:35] watching me. And I hiked right down this
[1:49:37] big passageway. And I'd heard the
[1:49:40] announcements, announcements,
[1:49:41] announcements. Gate 16. Gate 16. Uh,
[1:49:44] gate 16 in the final stages of loading.
[1:49:47] So I go down and I come to gate 16. And
[1:49:50] this is all windows here. All glass. And
[1:49:53] the other side of the glass is another
[1:49:55] security check where you have to put
[1:49:57] your bag through. And there's a security
[1:50:00] guard standing there. And I thought, "Oh
[1:50:03] no." And I turned a U-turn and headed
[1:50:05] right back out to the passageway the
[1:50:08] other direction towards the main
[1:50:09] terminal. I only got a few steps and I
[1:50:11] heard the voice. No, just try. And I did
[1:50:15] another Uturn. I must have looked like
[1:50:17] some kind of clown. I did another U-turn
[1:50:20] and headed right back and went in. And
[1:50:23] uh and I had I had my ticket. That's all
[1:50:24] I had. But I wasn't even supposed to be
[1:50:26] there without a boarding pass. And I
[1:50:28] come by and uh uh I I I don't think I
[1:50:31] even had a case to put on the thing. And
[1:50:33] when I came, the security guy said, "I'm
[1:50:34] going. I I'm on standby and I just have
[1:50:37] my ticket here." He says, "Who knows?"
[1:50:39] You know, and he just waved me on. I
[1:50:41] thought, "Boy, that was easy." So, I
[1:50:43] went in and and here's the last people
[1:50:45] in the per and the uh the the purser.
[1:50:48] He's coming out. He's saying, "Quick,
[1:50:50] quick." He's standing at the door and
[1:50:51] he's telling the girls, there's three
[1:50:53] girls here. He says, "Quick, quick. We
[1:50:54] got to close the door. You know, we're
[1:50:55] late. We got to close the door." And
[1:50:57] they're rushing through the last people.
[1:50:59] Here comes somebody else running as
[1:51:01] hard. They were late and they were all
[1:51:02] out of wind and so every time someone
[1:51:04] came up I just backed up because I
[1:51:06] wasn't even supposed to be there. So I
[1:51:07] just kept backing up and letting them in
[1:51:09] ahead. No, go ahead. Go ahead. And
[1:51:11] finally I got off there
[1:51:13] and I handed her my tickets.
[1:51:19] She said, "Where's your boarding pass?"
[1:51:21] I said, "I don't have one." Which said,
[1:51:24] "You're not supposed to be here without
[1:51:25] a boarding pass." I said, "Well, I'm
[1:51:28] just going on standby."
[1:51:30] And she says, "Well, you know, well, you
[1:51:33] have to have a boarding pass to be
[1:51:35] here." And I said, and these were just
[1:51:38] words that God had to give me. I said,
[1:51:39] "Well, can I just stand here?"
[1:51:43] And
[1:51:45] a lady who was a supervisor stepped up
[1:51:47] and she says, stepped up right behind
[1:51:49] her, says, "What does he want?"
[1:51:52] And she said, "He he just wants to stand
[1:51:54] here."
[1:51:57] And you know, they didn't know what to
[1:51:58] do with that sentence.
[1:52:00] They didn't know what to do. He just
[1:52:02] wants to stand here. Says, "Oh," she
[1:52:04] says, "Just wanted to stand here. It's
[1:52:07] fine." And so there's a great big uh
[1:52:09] square uh Ottomans right behind. And so
[1:52:13] I just sat down on it. And here come a
[1:52:15] little guy about my age that about my
[1:52:17] age now. And he come running in. He's a
[1:52:19] little scrawny guy. And he's running in.
[1:52:21] He I thought he's going to have a heart
[1:52:22] attack. He's just panting.
[1:52:24] And he gets up and he hands him boarding
[1:52:26] pass and says, and by this time the
[1:52:28] person had come up about three times,
[1:52:30] hurry here. He says, we got to close the
[1:52:32] doors. He said, we're late. We got to
[1:52:34] close the doors. And so they scooted
[1:52:36] this little guy up and I'm sitting there
[1:52:38] and the whole place is empty. I've let
[1:52:39] everybody, you know, go ahead cuz I'm
[1:52:41] I'm there kind of illegally. And I'm
[1:52:43] just sitting there and I saw her look
[1:52:46] down and put up she took something in
[1:52:49] her hand and the Holy Spirit said once
[1:52:52] again, "She's looking at your tickets."
[1:52:55] And she just looked up and she said,
[1:52:57] "Well, I might as well take you."
[1:53:01] And I said, "Thank you." And I I I just
[1:53:04] went through that door. The person was
[1:53:05] right there. They closed that door right
[1:53:07] behind me. I got on the got on the
[1:53:09] airplane and the door closed right
[1:53:11] behind me and I sat in smoking section
[1:53:15] in between seat for the next 12 hours
[1:53:20] and there was the days they smoked up a
[1:53:22] storm and I just thought you know maybe
[1:53:25] I'm supposed to witness to somebody or
[1:53:27] something. I don't know what's supposed
[1:53:28] to happen here. There's got to be some
[1:53:30] purpose to this. That was the first trip
[1:53:32] to India and from on that trip we bought
[1:53:35] the printing press and when we left
[1:53:37] there it was already started and it's
[1:53:40] gone for over 30 years.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Millions of messages. You know it
[1:53:46] doesn't always happen just real real
[1:53:48] easy. But I tell you what friends I I
[1:53:51] receive this message with all my heart.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:53:59] [Applause]
[1:54:05] I'm not going to keep you real long, but
[1:54:07] I I just can I just take along a little
[1:54:09] bit more? There's one one quote I want
[1:54:11] to come to,
[1:54:13] and I hope you love it with the same
[1:54:15] degree that I love it. As I said a
[1:54:18] moment ago that the ultimate is the
[1:54:20] receiving of the husband and wife and
[1:54:23] the uniting in time and sign. Brother
[1:54:25] Brandham says in the church and the
[1:54:26] bride and the word is becoming so one
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; until the very word itself is working
[1:54:33] out the works of the bridegroom.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Do you receive it? Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking this morning because I want
[1:54:46] every person, young and old, even though
[1:54:50] you may feel so short, say, "Well, I
[1:54:53] don't really understand that, and I
[1:54:55] don't know how in the world it's going
[1:54:56] to happen." Don't worry about how it's
[1:54:59] going to happen.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; You say, "I I've been such a failure.
[1:55:04] I've been this, that, the other thing."
[1:55:06] Don't Don't admit that.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; If you know you're a failure, the devil
[1:55:13] knows you're a failure. And I tell you,
[1:55:15] whatever the devil knows, God knows that
[1:55:17] and a whole lot more.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; And one thing that the devil doesn't
[1:55:21] know, he doesn't know what's in the mind
[1:55:22] of God. But you don't know what I'm
[1:55:24] going to make out of him.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; You don't know what I'm going to make
[1:55:27] out of her.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's something the devil
[1:55:31] doesn't know.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; He doesn't know what God's making out of
[1:55:35] us.
[1:55:37] Amen.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; comes in the ministry of a son of man
[1:55:45] to whisper his secrets to his bride.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Unites her with a s by a sacred union by
[1:55:53] the revealed truth. The revealed truth.
[1:55:56] Friends, we call a message the revealed
[1:55:59] truth is the cement.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the It is the cementing
[1:56:05] uh uh what do I say? The epoxy. It's
[1:56:10] what gives it the strength and he unites
[1:56:12] it. And so we are by a sacred union by
[1:56:15] the revealed word of truth for this hour
[1:56:18] and takes her to the home he has
[1:56:22] prepared.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; That's what this receiving is all about.
[1:56:26] Now,
[1:56:39] it's slide 12.
[1:56:54] I want to go over this very slowly.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Do you receive it?
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Notice the title. Proving
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; his word.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; He's going to prove it.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; He'll prove it to you.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Proving it.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; So you don't have to question it. Jesus
[1:57:16] said, "As it was in the days of Sodom,
[1:57:18] so will it be in the coming of the Son
[1:57:20] of Man." When the Son of Man is being
[1:57:23] revealed,
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; when the Son of Man, Don't read ahead of
[1:57:27] me if you would, please. When the Son of
[1:57:29] Man is being revealed, not no more as a
[1:57:33] church.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Now he's taking it to a different level.
[1:57:38] Churches received brother Prum churches
[1:57:41] received multitudes received Jesus
[1:57:44] Christ not as a church.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; This is a different level. Not no more.
[1:57:49] The brides called
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; in that day the son of man will be
[1:57:56] revealed.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; What he's saying simply, just give me
[1:58:00] your keen attention. He's saying simply
[1:58:03] the very fact here we are after the fact
[1:58:06] messenger has come the messenger's gone
[1:58:09] we have the message and it's simply
[1:58:11] saying the very fact that the messenger
[1:58:15] came was evidence that it was the time
[1:58:19] to call the bride
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; now you you just have to take that for
[1:58:23] what it means the very fact in the day
[1:58:26] when the son of man is revealed he's
[1:58:29] he's adding something to it he's adding
[1:58:31] another dimension. He said the very fact
[1:58:34] the very fact that this event happens is
[1:58:38] evidence to you the bride is being
[1:58:41] called
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; not a church
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; a bride
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; a bride. A woman
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; is being called that will move through
[1:58:55] this courtship
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; and be drawn in and wedded.
[1:59:01] The wedding doesn't happen in heaven.
[1:59:04] The wedding happens now.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Listen friends. Listen church. We're
[1:59:10] married.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; We are married to Jesus Christ.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; He is our head.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; The headship. We don't question the
[1:59:22] message. The world calls it
[1:59:24] brainwashing. I'm not interested in what
[1:59:26] they call it. There is lost and confused
[1:59:29] and total total uh just darkness out
[1:59:32] there. I'm not interested what the world
[1:59:34] I'm not interested in your peers, my
[1:59:36] peers, anybody's peers. They're lost
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; for the most part. We're interested in
[1:59:43] in what a prophet has said is our
[1:59:45] headship.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; What the scripture says, he is the head
[1:59:50] of the church.
[1:59:52] That's the end of it.
[1:59:57] And I desire, my desire for preaching
[1:59:59] this morning is that everyone under the
[2:00:02] sound of my voice can come to that place
[2:00:05] that I receive him.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; They that received him gave he power.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; I want you to receive that power.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; To become the sons of God. If you
[2:00:21] receive this church and say, "Well, I
[2:00:23] belong to Cloverdale by the way." That
[2:00:26] won't do it.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I know God sent a prophet. That
[2:00:30] won't do it. The woman at the well said,
[2:00:33] "You're a prophet." That didn't do it.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; She had to come to the place, you are
[2:00:39] the Messiah.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; You are the promised one.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; You are the final picture. You're the
[2:00:46] final thing.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Friends, you have to say, there is no
[2:00:49] more.
[2:00:51] If people within this message could
[2:00:53] recognize there isn't another messenger.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; How many husbands can you have there?
[2:01:00] The the the Christ is a is a husband.
[2:01:03] And as far as I'm concerned, William
[2:01:05] Brham produced
[2:01:08] brought that forth.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; And conducted a marriage ceremony. Amen.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; The invisible union of the bride of
[2:01:17] Jesus Christ to me united the bride with
[2:01:20] the bridegroom.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; And you are on your way to a supper.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; A marriage supper.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; We're married to him.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; You're married.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:33] [Applause]
[2:01:38] And so he says the bride's called in
[2:01:40] that day the son of man will be
[2:01:42] revealed. What? He asked the question to
[2:01:45] join the church to the head.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Unite the marriage of the bride.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom will come right through
[2:01:56] this.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom. I will not leave you
[2:01:59] comfortless. I will come to you. He did
[2:02:02] so on the day of Pentecost. He came in
[2:02:05] that form. There are the theologians
[2:02:07] from ancient theologians past that
[2:02:10] believe that was the second coming when
[2:02:12] Jesus said, "I will not leave you
[2:02:14] comfortless. I will come to you." And he
[2:02:16] fulfilled that. He did come to them
[2:02:18] because because Christ is also there's
[2:02:21] only one God.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; He's a son. And he was coming into the
[2:02:25] age of the Holy Spirit.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Going from son of man to son of God. It
[2:02:31] was in that transition and we're in the
[2:02:34] transition right now going from son of
[2:02:37] son of man
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; right through to son of David.
[2:02:43] So I don't want to get into that. But
[2:02:44] here he says, "And the bridegroom will
[2:02:48] come." When he said, "I go to prepare a
[2:02:51] place for you. And if I go to prepare a
[2:02:54] place for you, I will come."
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; And receive you.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; So there had to be, listen to me now,
[2:03:03] there had to be a people, listen to me,
[2:03:06] there had to be a people prepared for
[2:03:09] him to receive.
[2:03:13] [Applause]
[2:03:14] The
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; bride already had to be called. It's all
[2:03:18] in this paragraph.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; When the son of man, when the days of
[2:03:23] Noah are present, the days of Sodom are
[2:03:25] present and they are.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Do you receive that?
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; You receive that.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; If you receive that, then receive this.
[2:03:34] It'll be in that day. That is the proof
[2:03:37] that the son of man will be revealed in
[2:03:40] that day. And I want you to say, I also
[2:03:42] receive that.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Then if the son of man was revealed in
[2:03:47] that day, he was to reveal himself as
[2:03:49] the bridegroom.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; You receive that.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; And he received now that the bridegroom
[2:03:55] came in this ministry. And he showed the
[2:03:58] church his gifts.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; And the church was all excited about the
[2:04:03] gifts. all the gifts and the dazzle and
[2:04:07] the power of it and all the gift and the
[2:04:10] knowing and the secret of the hearts and
[2:04:12] oh isn't this wonderful. They thought
[2:04:15] they wanted that kind of a bridegroom.
[2:04:17] But when they begin to hear that he
[2:04:19] wanted to actually separate them from
[2:04:21] the church from the he wanted to
[2:04:24] separate them from the world. It was a
[2:04:26] separation they didn't want to didn't
[2:04:28] want to experience because they love the
[2:04:30] world.
[2:04:32] We love our our Hollywood hairstyles. We
[2:04:35] love the fashion of the world. We love
[2:04:37] the entertainment of the world. We love
[2:04:40] Well, we don't love Well, do you love it
[2:04:41] more than Jesus? Well, not really, but
[2:04:44] they do.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; And they have not they were not willing
[2:04:50] to receive him.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; It was so the same thing was happening
[2:04:54] again. He came to his own, but his own
[2:04:57] wouldn't receive him.
[2:05:00] But as many as received him to them. So
[2:05:04] the people already had to be here. The
[2:05:07] bride already had to be here. The called
[2:05:09] ones you already had to hear the
[2:05:11] message. And out of the message the
[2:05:13] people came and they were identified
[2:05:18] and and there's different degrees of
[2:05:20] receiving him.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Some said, "Well, you know, it's it's
[2:05:25] this Sunday I go to church. It's not it.
[2:05:29] You won't receive power to become sons
[2:05:30] of God. Say, "Well, I went to
[2:05:32] Cloverdale, by the way. It doesn't mean
[2:05:34] a thing."
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Well, I listen to this person, that
[2:05:38] person. No, it's it's it's that it comes
[2:05:43] into your
[2:05:45] knowing, into your knowing, your
[2:05:46] understanding, and it never leaves it.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; I've got a lot of books. We got discs.
[2:05:52] We got CDs. We got that. It has nothing
[2:05:54] to do with that. Has to do that. This is
[2:05:57] Christ.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; This is him revealing himself. This is
[2:06:02] him proving himself.
[2:06:04] And you see him, you know, you see you
[2:06:07] you read and maybe hear it on the book
[2:06:09] and you hear it on the tape and you see
[2:06:11] the revealing and brother Brand maybe
[2:06:13] preaches influence or preaches some
[2:06:15] other message or whatever. Then he calls
[2:06:17] people up and starts revealing the
[2:06:18] secret of their heart. People get all
[2:06:20] excited and enthused. But to you, it's a
[2:06:23] personal message to you. He Jesus Christ
[2:06:26] is using this vessel to prove to me
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; he knows the secret of my heart.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; And we say, "Oh, that's my husband."
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's my husband.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, that that's just like him.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we just love him more.
[2:06:47] And while people are missing it, we just
[2:06:49] love him more. We enter into such a
[2:06:52] union and a relationship with him.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; We say, "I love you, Lord."
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; And he responds and says, "I love you,
[2:07:00] too." Yes.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; So the bridegroom will come
[2:07:11] right through this
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; when the son of man will come down
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; and come in human flesh
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; to unite the two together.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; And that was the son of man representing
[2:07:25] himself in the flesh of that prophet
[2:07:28] uniting the two together. Listen folks,
[2:07:31] I announce it. The two have been made
[2:07:33] one.
[2:07:36] The union has taken place. We have
[2:07:39] already been united with the bridegroom.
[2:07:42] We're married to Jesus Christ and we're
[2:07:45] on our way home.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:50] [Music]
[2:07:50] [Applause]
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:59] The church
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; has to be the word.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; He is the word and the two unites
[2:08:07] together.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; And to do that, it'll take the
[2:08:10] manifestation of the revealing of the
[2:08:12] son of man.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; It's son of man. Jesus Christ
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; will come down.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you receive it? Will come
[2:08:22] down.

[2:08:29] real.

[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; cuz God has an order.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; And we'll go home to the wedding supper.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:10:48] into his embrace.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; And there's no way to get out of that.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Perilano
[2:10:56] unto myself that where I am there ye may
[2:10:59] be also.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:09] One of these words, this might be a
[2:11:11] blessing to you. I'm I've got to just go
[2:11:14] away from some pages because I want to
[2:11:16] end right away.
[2:11:18] But one of these words
[2:11:21] in this
[2:11:23] deci
[2:11:25] decomi
[2:11:27] it's one of its descriptions is that it
[2:11:31] is used of a place of a place
[2:11:36] that when one is being received or the
[2:11:38] receiving of one
[2:11:41] and that is why
[2:11:44] it's good for us to go back to the place
[2:11:48] when it happened.
[2:11:51] Do you know that brother Brandham he
[2:11:54] went back
[2:11:55] the places and you know all about it but
[2:11:58] he went back so many times. How many
[2:12:01] times do you go back and speak of the
[2:12:03] Ohio River?
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that was the place
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; he was told. He said just the same thing
[2:12:11] he said when I baptized right down there
[2:12:13] at the Ohio River.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here comes that big light
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; hanging y right yonder coming moving
[2:12:21] down over me and said as John the
[2:12:24] Baptist was sent to forrun the first
[2:12:27] coming of Christ you'll have a message
[2:12:29] that'll forrun the second coming of
[2:12:31] Christ is it the Ohio River
[2:12:35] when he came down on the Ohio River how
[2:12:37] about do you remember when he came down
[2:12:39] to you and the thing that he said to you
[2:12:42] he totally gave you a witness you're not
[2:12:44] of this world.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not of this insanity.
[2:12:48] You're not of all this religion. You've
[2:12:50] been in this church, that church, the
[2:12:51] other. You've been in the world. You've
[2:12:52] been in drugs. You've been in alcoholic.
[2:12:54] You've been an addict. You've been this.
[2:12:56] You've been that. None of that mattered
[2:12:58] anymore.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:01] [Music]
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; And you need to go back.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Part of that of him receiving you, you
[2:13:10] go back and say, "That's where
[2:13:14] I've done it.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; I've done it.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; I've had to get in my vehicle over the
[2:13:22] years and I've said just said to my
[2:13:24] wife, I have to just slip away.
[2:13:27] I'm going to I'm going to go up north,
[2:13:31] get in my truck. I'm not going hunting.
[2:13:34] I'm not going fishing. I'm not going to
[2:13:36] see anybody. I'm going to talk to him.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:42] and I'll maybe just stop. I remember one
[2:13:44] day clearly just stopped the truck on a
[2:13:46] bank and out in the middle of nowhere
[2:13:49] and looked over a big lake.
[2:13:52] It was fall time and the colors were all
[2:13:55] out and the wind was blowing and the
[2:13:58] fall leaves and I sat in the bank
[2:14:01] and I just told him
[2:14:05] a lot of things I don't know.
[2:14:08] A lot of things happening I don't
[2:14:10] understand.
[2:14:11] But one thing I know that was you that
[2:14:15] called me
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; and you were listening that day that I
[2:14:20] laid on that bed and gave you my life.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; That was you. And at another time and I
[2:14:26] just went to three or four spots. I
[2:14:28] don't know anything else that happened
[2:14:30] maybe in between. I can't explain it.
[2:14:32] But I know that was you.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; And I received that. Amen.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; I received you friends. He'll give you
[2:14:40] power
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; to become the son and daughter of God.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; I want you to be
[2:15:00] I'm going to just read that. I don't
[2:15:01] have this on a on a slide.
[2:15:06] At least I don't think so.
[2:15:12] No, it's fine.
[2:15:14] Will you listen to this? And I'm
[2:15:16] closing.
[2:15:19] The Bible says, this is the revelation
[2:15:21] of Jesus Christ series. The Bible says 2
[2:15:24] Corinthians 5:21
[2:15:26] that we have become and the reason why
[2:15:28] I'm reading this now after this long
[2:15:31] message
[2:15:34] if you'll please
[2:15:37] just give
[2:15:39] this honor to me to receive now what
[2:15:41] what he says. Sometimes it's hard but
[2:15:44] receive it.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:46] The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21
[2:15:51] that we have become the righteousness of
[2:15:54] God by our union with Jesus Christ.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; It says
[2:16:03] we are the very righteousness
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; of God himself.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Your mind will never grasp it. Don't try
[2:16:11] to think about it. Just say I receive
[2:16:13] that.
[2:16:15] Amen.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; By being in Christ, it says that he
[2:16:20] Jesus
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; became sin for us.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Now, if I can just have your attention
[2:16:25] for a few more moments, please. This is
[2:16:28] why I came to this and I there's a whole
[2:16:30] another side of this.
[2:16:32] A whole another side of I wish I had
[2:16:34] time but there's a whole another
[2:16:36] glorious grasp because it says as many
[2:16:39] as received him but when he received you
[2:16:44] were in sin.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; You were in unbelief.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; You were unclean. You were a cursor, a
[2:16:51] dammer, a blasphemer, a drinker, a this
[2:16:53] or that or the other thing. and and and
[2:16:56] not just these sins of the flesh. We're
[2:16:58] not talking about that. But we were
[2:16:59] unclean.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; We were unbelievers.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; He took your sin.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; He received it into himself.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Because he had the token.
[2:17:14] [Music]
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; And the And now listen, brother Brandon
[2:17:18] makes it and I'm glad he makes a he
[2:17:20] makes a special point of this. Amen.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; He became sin for us. It does not say he
[2:17:28] became sinful but be but became became
[2:17:33] sin for us that our union with him we
[2:17:37] might become the righteousness of God.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't mix he didn't mix his
[2:17:42] righteousness with our sin. We received
[2:17:46] him. He received us. He became sin for
[2:17:51] us. not sinful, but he took our sin. He
[2:17:55] received it
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; because he had the bleach
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; that could destroy it.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; And that's the only way by taking your
[2:18:08] sin into the bleach of his blood, you
[2:18:11] become sinless.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Do you receive that?
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; You become the righteousness of God.
[2:18:20] Otherwise these words don't mean
[2:18:21] anything. He said if we accept the fact
[2:18:24] and we must.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; That he literally became sin for us by
[2:18:30] his substitution for us then we must
[2:18:33] also accept the fact that we by our
[2:18:36] union with him have become the very
[2:18:41] righteousness of God.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; To reject one is to reject the other. be
[2:18:46] saved.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; To accept the one is to accept the
[2:18:53] other.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; And I accept it.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Wonder Brother Derek if you'll come. And
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we believe it with all of our
[2:19:12] heart. I trust I really trust, friend.
[2:19:14] You can take this receiving him.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; And I never even came near to the place
[2:19:20] where he said, "Receive ye the Holy
[2:19:24] Ghost."
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Receive it with a deliberate
[2:19:28] movement, a deliberate action.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; How many this morning after hearing this
[2:19:33] word will say, "I'm going to take a I'm
[2:19:35] going to take a renewed look at the
[2:19:37] whole at the whole encompassing the
[2:19:40] whole uh uh accumulation of the message
[2:19:44] because it friends as long as I stand
[2:19:47] behind this pulpit, as long as I have a
[2:19:49] message to preach behind any pulpit, I
[2:19:51] will believe that this word is him."
[2:19:54] That's fine.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; But now it's how to what degree do we
[2:19:58] receive it? Amen.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; It's not just another church. It's not
[2:20:04] just a few loose ends that are put
[2:20:06] together. It's not his idea mixed with
[2:20:08] some of his own thoughts and mixed with
[2:20:10] the scripture. It's not that.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; It is a proven vindicated word from God.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.

[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Why don't we stand to our
[2:20:35] feet? Amen.
[2:20:38] I will not be denied. I will not be
[2:20:40] denied.
[2:20:43] [Music]
[2:20:47] Death seized over my soul. Unto the Lord
[2:20:52] I cried.
[2:20:54] Till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[2:20:58] would not be denied.
[2:21:02] I would not be denied.
[2:21:06] I would not be denied
[2:21:10] till Jesus came.
[2:21:13] Behold, I would not be denied.
[2:21:18] As Jacob in the days of old, I wrestled
[2:21:23] with the Lord.
[2:21:26] And instant with a courage bold I stood
[2:21:30] upon his word.
[2:21:33] I would not be
[2:21:37] I would not be
[2:21:41] till Jesus came and he made me whole.
[2:21:45] Would not be.
[2:21:48] Oh s
[2:21:50] my heart was gone.
[2:21:53] Now you are praying.
[2:22:20] Not
[2:22:21] [Applause]
[2:22:26] Jesus came
[2:22:31] not
[2:22:33] [Music]
[2:22:35] praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; When he reached down his hand for me,
[2:22:39] just a verse, maybe a chorus,
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; was a straight
[2:22:49] from the heaven
[2:22:51] [Music]
[2:22:59] for me.
[2:23:03] Oh my
[2:23:11] god.

[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:07] now.
[2:25:13] Before we sing it once again,
[2:25:16] I want to ask this congregation like to
[2:25:18] put you on notice.
[2:25:20] [Music]
[2:25:22] I'd like you to say, I'm receiving
[2:25:27] my place of responsibility
[2:25:31] in my home
[2:25:34] in the body of Christ
[2:25:37] that's both here and both elsewhere.
[2:25:40] I'm receiving it. I want the young
[2:25:42] people to say, "I receive the headship
[2:25:47] of my parents.
[2:25:50] I receive the headship
[2:25:53] of the ministry.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; I receive the headship
[2:25:58] of what the message declares.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't discovered it, it
[2:26:03] would be good. Pick it up.
[2:26:06] And you can start with the message,
[2:26:09] young people,
[2:26:11] older ones. Christ is the mystery of God
[2:26:14] revealed.
[2:26:15] And this is one of the great secrets
[2:26:18] that has come to light and has been made
[2:26:21] known this time.
[2:26:23] And I announce to this church and all
[2:26:25] whoever here as far as as far as this
[2:26:27] church is concerned and anything I have
[2:26:30] to do with it, we receive the headship
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; of this word.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; And we don't need another.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; We don't need anybody's opinion.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; We don't need anybody's idea. We just

[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; not just as redeemer, not just as
[2:27:18] healer, not just as something else, not
[2:27:21] just as friend, but I receive you, oh
[2:27:24] husband,
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; husband of the church, husband of my
[2:27:28] soul,

[2:27:34] Lord,
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; make known yourself to me, oh my Lord
[2:27:37] Jesus.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll bless this
[2:27:40] congregation as we go and depart this
[2:27:44] depart this sanctuary.
[2:27:47] May your presence be with everyone
[2:27:48] throughout this afternoon, oh God. And
[2:27:51] as we are preparing now for the time out
[2:27:53] at the camp and people will be coming
[2:27:55] from different states, from different
[2:27:57] places, even different countries coming.
[2:27:59] Oh God, I prepare I pray you'll prepare
[2:28:03] us to be what we need to be for the body
[2:28:05] of Christ.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; We assume and receive our
[2:28:08] responsibility. Oh God, to be brothers
[2:28:11] indeed, sisters indeed.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I'm being so blessed in in
[2:28:20] making this commitment my own soul. Oh
[2:28:23] God, let us be what we ought to be to
[2:28:26] one another when we take one another and
[2:28:28] embrace one another and shake hands with
[2:28:30] one another. May the Holy Spirit flow
[2:28:32] from heart to heart, from attribute to
[2:28:34] attribute. And may this congregation
[2:28:37] become a strengthened congregation.
[2:28:39] Lord, not a bunch of individuals that
[2:28:41] come together, but one unit.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, meld us together, oh God. Bless the
[2:28:47] service this afternoon, oh God, as our
[2:28:49] brother Andy's and others go with him to
[2:28:52] Seattle and the saints that will gather
[2:28:54] there. May they have a mighty time, I
[2:28:56] pray.
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, Holy Spirit. We give
[2:29:01] ourselves to you entirely, completely.
[2:29:05] We love you.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; We love you. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:29:15] I love him. I love him. I love him. With
[2:29:17] this we all go.
[2:29:22] I
[2:29:24] love you.
[2:29:28] I
[2:29:31] love you.
[2:29:35] Be
[2:29:40] worthy.
[2:29:49] and
[2:29:53] just my
[2:29:56] Salvation
[2:29:57] [Music]
[2:30:18] on your room, on your sofa, in your car.
[2:30:21] But I'd like to say something to you
[2:30:23] personally right from my heart to yours.
[2:30:26] the next time or as soon as you can and
[2:30:29] you hear the prophet of God, our
[2:30:33] precious brother Brandham,
[2:30:35] God's prophet and your prophet.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; The next time you hear him and he he
[2:30:41] begins to call to the people
[2:30:44] and then and then that that one our
[2:30:47] husband takes over his voice and begins
[2:30:51] to tell the people the secret of the
[2:30:52] heart. I'd like you to say I'd like you
[2:30:55] to say something.
[2:30:57] I love that.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; I just love you, Lord.
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; That's not him, a man. He's yielding to
[2:31:06] it, but I that's you. I believe that
[2:31:10] that's none other than Jesus Christ, my
[2:31:13] husband. You're the one that's speaking.
[2:31:15] And the reason I'm counseling you to do
[2:31:17] that is because he loves to hear that.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; He loves to hear that. And and the
[2:31:22] reason I saying that is because
[2:31:27] it let the Lord know that what was
[2:31:30] spoken this morning kind of touched you
[2:31:32] and got through to you.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; You said, "I'm going to do that."
[2:31:36] Saying, "Brother Ed counseledled me,
[2:31:38] advised me, and with his whole heart
[2:31:41] told me to say, I love you.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; I love you. I love every time. I love
[2:31:46] this vindication.
[2:31:48] Oh, I love how you prove yourself." and
[2:31:51] you just see how he responds to you.
[2:31:54] Hallelujah. And he'll pour out good
[2:31:55] things upon your life. God bless you.
[2:31:58] You're dismissed in Jesus name. I
[2:32:03] love
[2:32:05] one another with a real Christian offer.
[2:32:19] be first.
