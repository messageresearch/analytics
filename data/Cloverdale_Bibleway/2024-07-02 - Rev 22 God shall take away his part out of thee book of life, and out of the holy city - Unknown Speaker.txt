TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the revelation of St John the Divine chapter 22 and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testifieth these things saith surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen
