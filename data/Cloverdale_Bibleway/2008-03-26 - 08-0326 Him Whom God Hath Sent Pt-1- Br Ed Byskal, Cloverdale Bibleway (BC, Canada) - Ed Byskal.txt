It's good to be in the house of the Lord this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. It truly is. We have a neverchanging God. Who acts in his own time and his own season is wonders to perform. We're living witnesses that he's still moving, still dealing with hearts. even in the hospital just a couple of days ago. We met a young man that we'll pray for this evening. His baby had just been flown there, just born a few hours before. And the whole hospital is filled with case after case after case. But one tender man approached me and said, "Would you pray for my little girl?" He could have walked up to anybody and said that, I suppose, but just coming out of the chapel there at the the little hospital. So, we don't know what the Lord is doing. We just say, "Use me, Lord. Lead me, Lord, and I'll follow. Whatever you desire, we'll do. You're all I want." Let's sing it together. You're all I want. You're all that I need.

Father, we just offer you this service this evening. All we want is you, Lord. We desire, Father, that you would come. You said whenever you are invited, Lord, that you are near, Lord. We know your presence has drawn near unto us, Lord. Lord, we desire that you would make yourself known this evening, Lord, not just to be around, Father, but to dwell in us, to live through us, to be your life expressed. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to your name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. 10:15 on the screen if you would. Just some songs that I thought were pertinent tonight. They don't necessarily flow key to key. And I know sometimes that's really nice to be able to do, but we want the word to be able to just minister to our hearts tonight. Amen. Lead me Lord. I will follow me. I [Music] you have me. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] I will answer [Music] as we stand to our feet tonight. I will [Music] be Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat.

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're stirred tonight, Father, at the anticipation of your word. at the anticipation of what you will speak this evening. Lord, you spoke in the scriptures to Peter and said, "Follow me." Lord, he didn't know what that really meant, but one day he caught the revelation of what follow me really was about. Grant it to us tonight, Lord. Open your word to us, Father. May we be revelated, Lord. We don't want just knowledge. We don't just want to learn quotes or memorize scripture, but we want a living reality today. Take the man of God that will stand behind the sacred desk. Lord, move the man part aside. May the Holy Spirit minister life. May you speak the word that delivers the bond tonight. Lord, that heals the sick. May the lame walk and the blind see. Not just naturally, Lord, but spiritually. &gt;&gt; This world is groping in darkness, Father. But you said there would be a light in the evening time. And so we have gathered, Lord. At the evening time. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just want to read a couple of prayer requests. Brother Alex desires that we remember his mother in Spain who will be going into surgery tomorrow for a hip replacement. [Music] Remember to pray for Sister Audrey Bates from Idaho. She is suffering and in a tremendous amount of pain due to lung cancer. She is praying and desiring a full healing from the the Dods. Brother Ed Dods wrote in that he spoke with a Christian grandmother who asked for prayer for her granddaughter Aaron Smith. Apparently, the baby suffers from broken broken bones, but it never bruises and the parents are blamed for child abuse. It's a tragic situation, but now the mother has been diagnosed with uh severe bone. I don't know how to pronounce that word, but a condition with the bones where they break without really any trauma coming to them. So, they're desiring that the Lord would move on their behalf, grant a healing to both mother and child. Our Lord is more than able. We also want to remember uh it's a an announcement and a uh and a bit of a request. Brother Ken and Sister Helen Buckles are proud grandparents of a baby boy, Luke William Buckles, born this afternoon, March 26th, and uh in Louisville, Kentucky. But they'd ask that we remember the baby in prayer as it uh when it was born. It was amazing that it was alive, the nurses said because the the umbilical cord was in a knot. And uh so they just want to watch it for 48 hours and make sure that the baby's going to be fine. We do want to remember uh my son little David 3 months old. The doctors have diagnosed him with a condition called um hypo hypoglycemia which is a an extreme amount of uh the pancreas is overproducing insulin and it breaks down the sugar too quickly before the body can consume it. But we have a prayer answering God. &gt;&gt; You've been praying. Weii applied the prayer cloth to him. We believe Abraham, it took 25 years and by the time it came over to this side of Calvary, the scripture said he staggered not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In our daily walk, sometimes we feel like where where are things? Where are we? But the scripture says we stagger not. &gt;&gt; And that's what the promise says. So we stagger not at the promise of God. I'll ask brother DDA. Brother DDA, if you'd come and just open the service in a word of prayer. Amen. And if you have a need upon your heart, whatever it may be, great or small, our God is more than able to answer our needs. [Music] Father, we are overwhelmed at your presence. Lord, are you come in thine own gentle way? Are you move upon our hearts, oh God? You have such a desire towards your people. Dear Father, we are amazed tonight at your love, at your care, at your grace, at your mercy. Father, at your consideration for us as nothing and nobody is of this world, but how you have redeemed us with your very own blood. I you send this great message of deliverance and truth to cross our paths. That we could be standing here tonight in a world that is dying and corrupting in a world that is falling apart but yet we can stand in the presence of the creator. Knowing that you have given us an audience we can come and make our petition known and you more willing to answer them than we are even to pronounce them tonight. Lord, what confidence we have tonight before the living God, to know that you have something good in store for us, Father. We have not just gathered out of our own desire, oh God. We have gathered according to your word. For you say where two or three are gathered in your name, there you are. So in your divine presence tonight we come with expectation Lord with confidence and with faith that every needs can be met tonight that every heart can be satisfied but only you Jesus. Oh father even as the song was sang tonight. Oh take the world but give me Jesus. You're the one who can meet every need. You're the one who can meet every longing. You're the one who can satisfy every desire tonight. In you are found all the blessings that we have need of. So we come, Father, our hearts are open tonight. We say come and fill us, oh God, with more of yourself, with more of your divine love. Oh God, with more of your presence, Father, just overtake our being once again. Fill us, oh God, until we can take no more tonight. Let it not just be a church gathering, but it'll be, oh father, a meeting with the living God. Touch every soul tonight. Let your word be a revelation to every hearts. Give your servant liberty, oh God, when he open his mouth, that our words of life can flow that he may minister, father, to the inner man. That at the end of the service, we all be strengthened, Father. We'll be more equipped to face this hour and that you're preparing us for a body change. We want to make much of your presence that is here. Not just let this be, oh God, a passing moment, but let it be, oh God, a time that will be long remembered. We know it's a Wednesday evening, Father, but you're here among us, Lord, and in the presence of the living God. Nothing is impossible. Every need can be met, Father. Every burden can be lifted up. Every prayer can be answered if we can but believe tonight. You told us to only believe for all things are possible. Father, we confess that you're more than able to minister to us. Oh God, we believe. Will not go out empty. We came believing and asking. We can go rejoicing. Father, for you are more abundantly supply to us tonight. So touch every life, Lord. The needs that have been mentioned tonight. Some are suffering this day with cancer. Oh God, even with with other kind of condition, Father, that medical sciencers baffle their own, but we believe you're the great physician. We believe you can move on behalf of those that have written down their prayer requests tonight in faith and in confidence that when we gather and unite our hearts as one, our God will answer our petition. So touch them each one I pray and let all the glory be given back to you for you're the great one among us tonight and we recognize you as that father we just want to take the time to tell you that we love you and we appreciate you oh God we delight in you father we just long for more of you tonight we want this meeting to be a special time where you can speak to our hearts where you can move us into a higher plane father where our faith can be increased to believe every promise tonight. Bless your children, oh God, and bless your servant as it come tonight. Would you just have the preeminence, take full control of this gathering and bless every soul and bring glory to your great name as we commit the meeting to you. And we thank you for the privilege of coming in your presence. Father, touch every life. I pray forgive us our shortcoming tonight. Just have your preeminence. We commit ourselves to you, Father, and we thank you in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. You may have your seats. As we get ready to turn to the word, we'll just sing. He is here. Hallelujah. He is here. I did mention that young man that I met in the hospital just a few short days ago. this baby had been flown in uh had a has a heart valve I believe that's not opening properly and they've scheduled the little girl for surgery just tomorrow morning. So if you'll remember her in your prayers, we've prayed for her on Sunday night. We went up to their their room where they keep the the little infants in play prayed for and um I believe my wife is going to be with them first thing in the morning about 6:00 again. So just hold them up in your prayers as well. very very nice young man. I'm very actually very moved by having met him. You meet so many people in the world and they feel like the world. But there's something you Brother Brandham used to say when a person would come up and he'd say, "You have a very welcoming spirit." And I would say that about this young man. So just remember him in your your prayer time. Amen. We'll just sing this together as we invite our pastor to come. He is here. Hallelujah. He is here. [Applause] Amen. He is here. Holy, holy. I will bless his holy name. [Music] He is here [Music] in [Music] your hand. He is here. You can touch him. You will never be the same for me. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen. He is [Music] holy. I will bless his name. [Music] Oh [Applause] your [Music] touch. You will never be. Can we stand together as we sing it again? My brother is to come. He is here. Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] You will never be the same. Just before we turn to the word, I'd like to have you sing. We are standing on holy ground. You know, we're privileged people to have heard the things that we've heard, to hear the things we'll hear tonight, to have the message that we have. We're privileged people. Just before coming to church just a short time ago, I received a call also from uh a former resident right of our area. And I don't know whether it was the uh result of the media or what it was, but he looked me up and and uh called and we we just we have never gotten on uh you know on personal things and my heart just became touched and heavy as well uh before the service. He has a 17-year-old son with muscular distrophe and uh no hope, no chance of any recovery, no chance of any outside of God, there'd just be no chance for the young man 17 years old. And I thought of our our young men that are here uh and no future. And he said he's got we've got a window of 5 years if they would discover something in the next 5 years. after 5 years which would only be 22 uh the the muscles will be beyond recovery and uh you know I I I just said something to him about prayer and uh he's a very very fine man I don't know if God will open a door but I I just got speaking with my wife after the phone call I said you know the world is a very very very burdened and troubled place and We're so grateful we can come into this this place of retreat that we have place where we can let off the pressure in Christ. I tell you what, when the prophet says we have a place to let off the pressure, not everybody has access to that place. He didn't say we wouldn't have pressure. In fact, he said we would, but we've got a place to let it off. &gt;&gt; And in case you're under pressure tonight, friends, you've arrived at the right place. You got a place you can lay it off. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to sing. We're standing on holy ground. We are standing. [Music] Yes, we are on holy ground. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus. We are standing in his presence on holy ground. &gt;&gt; We've prayed, but I want to just say, Lord Jesus, we are here tonight to give you thanks, to praise your name, and we we and believe completely that the angels of God are here, the Holy Spirit is present, and you are here. As we've already declared in our previous course, he is here, Lord Jesus. You're here now to make your word alive. &gt;&gt; You're here to give utterance by your Holy Spirit. I pray you'll move on me and through me, oh God. Move on the people and through them, I pray. and may we be revelated tonight according to your own will and desire in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. So nice to see the house of God full. I'll have you turn in your Bibles to uh the Gospel of John, the 6th chapter. We're going to read from verse 26. And this evening as we uh I I I I'm going to try to restrain myself from preaching because I would like to lay a good foundation for Sunday morning service. And but it's it's it's not easy for me. You know, I'm I'm one to you know what it's all about. You just get fired up and then you have a hard time holding holding the rains in. So, uh, you help me out. If you say amen too many times, I'm going to go for it. All right. Verse 26. Jesus answered them and said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, you seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled. Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you, for him hath God the Father sealed. Then said they unto him, "What shall we do that we might work the works of God?" Jesus answered and said unto them, "This is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. I'll give you the title to the service right away. Uh it is him whom God hath sent. What shall we do? They said, "What shall we do? We want to do something. Is there something? Is there some action that we can take that we might work the works of God?" And then Jesus said, "This is the work of God." It's interesting uh right away that the word that they used uh for work, what can we do or what shall we do that we might work? And that work that they made reference to is what kind of labor can we do? What can we exercise? What labor? What work should we perform? or is there something we can you know be active in and produce so that it would be the works of God? And Jesus used a different word and he said this is the work of God or this is the labor but the word that Jesus used is this is what you should be occupied with. This is what you should seek to accomplish. This is the act or the deed that you should do. You should be occupied with believing on him who he has sent. &gt;&gt; That's what we should be occupied with. &gt;&gt; That's the instruction of Christ that you believe on him whom God hath sent. That that should that that's that's what should actually be occupying our minds. This is the focal point that uh Jesus has said and the works of God. In other words, the works of God is first and foremost to believe. This is the works of God. First and foremost is to believe on him whom he hath sent. Of course, we could say right away, well, we all we already do. And I'm I'm thankful for uh the congregation here and the believers of the message because we believe on him whom God hath sent and we are we are occupied with that. But I I believe that there's uh really something here for us in this uh in in this uh which I wish to carry it in some depth between now and Sunday morning. One of the more difficult things uh for us as humans and I I say us but it's a general public. One of the most difficult things is for people to acknowledge and to accept him who God hath sent. There always seems to be a built-in uh hesitation to believe on him whom God has sent. People are continually wanting to circumvent and we run into it all the time. This isn't necessarily making a personal reference to yourself here this evening, but what you're confronted with on a on a regular basis is that people are constantly wanting to circumvent or go around and say, "Well, we don't need a prophet &gt;&gt; or we don't need a pastor or we don't need uh some office. We don't need it. We, you know, I got a direct line to God. And uh uh they're always wanting and I can show it. We'll show it in the scripture. That's part of the what we want to do this evening is show how they always want to circumvent God's chosen vessel or messenger at at at any specific time. And there's a there's a reason for that is because I can tell you that Satan is very energetic &gt;&gt; about wanting to turn people aside from the the servant that God sends. &gt;&gt; He's very energized about that subject. And I'll tell you why in a few moments. Now, it's also difficult. This is taken from the other side. Now, it's difficult for those that are chosen and have been chosen to declare it. It's always been difficult. And the Bible tells us, I'm going to give a number of scriptures if you want to uh just follow along or just make a note of it. In Matthew 3 and3, uh John the Baptist, he's coming on the scene and he's saying, "For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight." So now he's identifying himself uh out of the scriptures. This is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah. And therefore uh God always presented his elected always presented his elected or his chosen in a veiled way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He always did. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Joseph, I'm going to just take a number of of examples. Joseph in the Old Testament chosen of God, but he presents him in a veiled way. He was veiled by dreams. He gave the dreams to his brothers and to his uh to his mother and father. And as a result of those dreams, he was terribly misunderstood. In other words, as a result of his being chosen to fulfill a certain place, he was completely misunderstood. And that happened to be the focal point of not only misunderstanding but of of of I would say a a family trouble within the family and dissension and even hatred between the brothers was was the actual focal point of his being chosen of God. And so God, he didn't just come out and declare I've been chosen of God, you know, to do special things. He didn't make that declaration. It was so God allowed it to be veiled and he had dreams and perhaps didn't under certainly didn't understand the full extent of the dream. But he tells what the dream was and and then they begin to perceive that, you know, that he's he's going to be elevated. He's going to be lifted up somehow and they can't piece it together or how this but it's it's sufficient to irritate them and it becomes an irritation. his his choosing the very fact and God is slowly letting him know uh that you know not the full degree of his being chosen and what he's being chosen for but just allowing him to know that he's in a different category &gt;&gt; than those that are around him and sufficiently enough to irritate it just becomes an irritation &gt;&gt; that's Joseph &gt;&gt; Moses He was veiled in humiliation as a failed leader. After all, he murdered a man, tried to hide him in the sand. This is not a myth. It's not just a story. It is it's an event. That's what happened to him. He actually failed. and he fell from uh the height of leadership and glory and power and a and a man who knew war and was educated in all the ways of Egypt. He was a next pharaoh perhaps and and living in the glory of the of the superpower of that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. And to go from that to be on the back side of a desert wrapped in shepherd's garments and looking after sheep, it must have gone through his mind quite a few times because he would have just as alert a memory as you do. And if you had gone from that to to being a shepherd, and a shepherd even by the Egyptian standard was something to be disdained. you're a shepherd. And God allowed him to go right down to the bottom as it were. And no doubt in the quietness of the desert, in the quietness of just having the sheep bleeding and feeding and very very little activity with that. That was a long way from the chariots and the armies and the trumpets and the uh marble palaces and the beautiful carpets of the Persian uh of that era and that time. I mean he went a long ways. You can hardly imagine that. And no doubt he thought you know what is happening and yet God was bringing him to a place uh and and and what God was going to use him for. God was actually veiling him in his choosing. He was choosing him to use him in in a way that he couldn't couldn't even imagine. &gt;&gt; Right? And so God was also preparing him uh in in this uh in in his uh uh shall I say in in in the life that he was experiencing. He was also naturally speaking he had difficulty and God was veiled in that. God was veiling Moses him also. I'm speaking about Moses being veiled. He was veiled in the fact that he was slow of speech and he was he was not an impressive speaker. And here's a man that God chose to give the law. &gt;&gt; He's going to speak on behalf of God. And God said clearly and Moses had to say it because Moses wrote the first five books. He had to say that he was the meakest man on the earth. had to say that God had to speak on behalf of God that God has spoken to no other man like he spoke to him. &gt;&gt; Now it doesn't sound like the meakest man, but he had to be truthful also. &gt;&gt; And so that's but he was so slow and and I don't know what the manner of his speech was. But you know, you that are believers of the message, you can you see the message that we have and the and and the grammar of it and how it's broken down and and how it was delivered to us. It's the the message that you have. Uh there's a lot of similarities. &gt;&gt; It is not the, you know, it is not the flamboyant. It is not the majestic literature. It is to us, &gt;&gt; but it's not to the average person &gt;&gt; because that's all part of God's veil, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; And the and this is this is a part of the misunderstanding. Although, and this is difficult for us to perhaps grasp, but although it was abundantly evident that Moses was the chosen and that God was with him because he had already had uh uh the miracles and the plagues that came in Egypt. And then they get out uh out into the wilderness a short distance. And this very fact that he was chosen is is some of his greatest trouble. And the Bible says, "Now Kora, the son of Ishar, and the son of Korath, the son of Levi, and Dayathan and Abraham, the sons of Eliab, and Anne, the son of Pelath, sons of Reuben, took men, and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel, 250 princes, of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown. I'd like you to notice, you've read it, and these are perhaps very familiar to you, but in the context of what I'm going to be bringing you, I want you to see this now. the very fact that God had chose him and to the degree he was chosen. He wasn't just chosen to come back out of his uh uh shepherd work back to Egypt. He wasn't just chosen to bring the plagues on Egypt. He wasn't just chosen to become a deliverer for Israel. But now he also has trouble within his own delivered people because of the degree of his his choosing &gt;&gt; because when they get out there and realize he's actually the only mouthpiece of God &gt;&gt; that becomes his trouble. &gt;&gt; Not not that he was able to deliver them. That wasn't the problem. Not that he had power with God. That wasn't the trouble. But the people around them failed to failed to recognize that God had extended or intensified this choosing to the place where he was the only mouthpiece. &gt;&gt; And that's where the problem started to arise. And so they continued and you could see that they these men they had influence amongst the people of Israel. When you raise up 250 men of renown, I mean, these weren't men who were unimpressive in their conversation or their speech like Moses was. These were men who were articulate. These were men who were commanding. These were men of personality. These were men who could rise up and stand up and have the attention of the people and so that the people were swayed by it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says, "And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, you take too much upon yourself, seeing that all the congregation is holy." Moses never said they weren't holy. He never said that they weren't holy, but now they're they're pressing a certain point. All of the people are holy and every one of them and the Lord is amongst them. Wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord. They never lifted themselves up but they perceived by the by misinterpreting the choice of God. And so really now when you boil this thing down, what they're really doing is saying, "God, you've made a mistake in this choosing. You've made a mistake." And they want to circumvent the very the very mouthpiece that God has chosen. &gt;&gt; So now they're telling God, "Uh, this is the wrong choice." Uh, and even God's preparation. Oh my, I want I'm just throwing some things out that I'm going to come back to. They're saying to God, "Your preparation of this vessel was somehow faulty. This one isn't really prepared for this position. And there's something that is uh uh that is that it just isn't adequate. It's not sufficient." and they want to go around it. And so they said, "And you've lifted up yourself above the congregation of the Lord." And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face. &gt;&gt; Just imagine the the kind of vessel he was when he heard it. You're not the only holy one. The whole congregation's holy. He could see the direction that they were coming from. He could see what and he knew what the consequence was and he fell on his face. That was Moses. I'm just bringing a number of characters out of the scripture to show that uh their the the focal point is that their choosing them being chosen of God was a problem to them. Lord willing on Sunday, I want to bring it. You also have been chosen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's going to be one of your biggest problems. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It's one of your biggest problems. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you think that's going to be a what the young people call a cakewalk, it's not. &gt;&gt; No, sir. And regardless of where what your status is or where you are, there's two things that happen here. One is that the individual Moses, David, Joseph, all of them going to come to the rest of them, they had to realize that God had singled them out &gt;&gt; for a certain choosing. And then they had to also realize that this and if they didn't realize it, they would soon realize it because that happens to be the whole atmosphere and the environment of the world is in opposition to God's choosing. &gt;&gt; And that starts to be the rubbing spot. &gt;&gt; That's that is the irritant. And you cannot you cannot rid yourself of that irritant. &gt;&gt; As much as you may try or as much as you try to, you know, uh uh pacify it, you just it's impossible to do so. It's just going to be an irritant. &gt;&gt; Let me go on. David also uh we could we could uh just make a few references uh to David. The the choosing of God was veiled in him in that not only that he was the youngest but he was just a strippling. The Bible says he was a strippling. He was just a a a little unimpressive fellow. And yet he was the one even Samuel the prophet missed it. said, "Surely this is the one." No, surely this is the one. Surely this is the one. Then if you brought it down into, you know, into our time or into the time when the message was coming forth, you know, uh there was men that had had, I would say, more powerful ministries on the surface, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; than than than brother Brandham's appeared to be. when I was with him on one occasion, he said he'd just come by come by come through Tulsa on the way up north and he he was uh with brother Oral Roberts and he just said you know brother Oral and he said we he said oh my uh he said the enterprise that he has the work that he has is just you know he said I I wouldn't know what I would do with that he said you know and then I think of my little office and he described the building that he was in and kind of the aluminum ceiling or something and it was so impressive. He was impressed with it and then you know he just re his his little office relative to what he just saw. He said it's just you know it's just nothing. I have a little desk and so on and uh uh there were a lot of ministries. There were men who could speak. I don't know if you've ever heard Erin Baxter who was brother Brandham's manager. I I' I've heard on a tape him speak on faith. powerful. I mean, he was powerful. But the thing was that's choosing of God. &gt;&gt; God's not impressed with how people can put words together. &gt;&gt; God's impressed with humility. &gt;&gt; And God's servants are humble. And brother Brandham said, "God's people are humble." And there are certain things, there are certain qualities that identify God's people. David was uh one of those that I would say the call of God on his life was was veiled. Let me speak of John the Baptist for just a moment. Then said they unto him, speaking to John the Baptist, who are you? Who art thou? That we may give an answer to them who sent. So there was people who were wondering that who sent them said go to this go to this man and ask him who he is and what do you say about yourself. So he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah. I'm certain I'm absolutely convinced that they were not satisfied with that answer. Right. Well, &gt;&gt; who are you? We we need to give a a sufficient answer to those who have sent us. What was why were they even asking that question? Because they could see not because they wanted to really know, but they were being it was it was an annoyance to them. It was an irritation to them because there was just certain characteristics about him that was troubling. And so they wanted to find out who you are. And God was veiling in in his very character in the way that he was. He was veiling that the fact that he was chosen of God to to and and I'm sure that John the Baptist did not understand what the extent I'm sure at that moment he could not tell them uh I'm due for a beheading in a short time. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm headed for prison. I'm sure that that was not part of what he knew about himself. So even his even the degree of his choosing was being veiled by God to to to John the Baptist himself. And then we we can come to Jesus and I could spend the whole service on this. Then said they unto him, who art thou? Same question, same people, same problem. There's just something in the psyche of the unbeliever &gt;&gt; that can sense you're different. &gt;&gt; You're just different. And that difference isn't something that we really revel in and love to see, but it's something that's troubling to us. &gt;&gt; And haven't got any real substance to itemize why they're troubled. You stand away and say, "What is it?" Well, uh, is he a good man? Oh, yes, absolutely. Uh, you know, wonderful man, this young prophet. H, what do you have against, uh, you know, brother Brandham's ministry? Oh, he was a good man and wonderful ministry and all of these things, but to really identify what is the irritation and then they invent invent false &gt;&gt; phrases &gt;&gt; went off in the end. &gt;&gt; True. I want to announce to this congregation that has to be one of the most erroneous statements, one of the most absurd statements, one of the most childish and juvenile statements. And people who who themselves think themselves to be theologically, you know, attuned and educated and so on to come up with such a statement. &gt;&gt; It went off on the end. Well, please tell me about that. and they're lost. &gt;&gt; See, totally lost. I'm just throwing this in so you kind of see where I'm coming from. Then they said to Jesus, "Who art thou?" And Jesus said to them, "Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning." I'm trying to say something to you. You know, when when even you are asked very specific and direct questions, what is it that you believe? It's not always good to say so. Well, I believe just exactly what you have seen in my life. Whatever that is. &gt;&gt; If you like it, great. If you don't, too bad. &gt;&gt; I'm living what I believe. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't always answer questions. &gt;&gt; In fact, is when he was asked question, a very specific question, you know what he did? He said, "I'll ask you a question." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And rather than be on the defensive, he went on the offensive. &gt;&gt; And that's a very, very good principle. &gt;&gt; Very good principle. And it's something you should always remember. I use it in fact all the time. And I'll tell you how I use it in just a moment. So Jesus said, "I'll ask you a question. John the Baptist, was he of God or was he of man?" So they had to get into a huddle. And they said, 'Well, if we say that he was of man, they're going to stone us because they think that John was a a prophet. If we say he's of God, then he's going to say, 'Why didn't you believe him? &gt;&gt; So they come back and say, "We can't say." &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither can I tell you." &gt;&gt; People come, you know, from Pentecost, those that have felt that they had the, you know, kind of the ultimate of full gospel say, "Well, he went off in the end." I said, "Well, just a second." Uh, you know, they asked me maybe a question or two. Let me ask you a question. Is Pentecost today where it was &gt;&gt; years ago? Oh, then they almost need to go into a huddle. So, well, well, no, it's not. Uh, you're right. It sure isn't. In fact, is today it's a disgrace, isn't it? Are you upholding what it are you upholding what it is right now? Are you upholding all of this Hollywood stuff? Are you upholding all of this world? Are you upholding all of this nonsense? Well, and then they get backpedaling right away. Are you upholding all this appearance? Are you upholding all this Hollywood showmanship? Are you upholding all of this rock bands? Utter nonsense. Are you upholding that? Is that what you're saying? No. No. Don't Don't talk to me about what I what I believe. &gt;&gt; You don't have any you don't have any grounds for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's good to ask him some questions. &gt;&gt; And then Jesus said, "Verily, verily, I say," this is John 8:51, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death." Then said the Jews unto him, now we know thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets, and thou sayest of a man, keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead, and the prophets are dead. Whom makest thou thyself? See where their trouble was? Because they they now had come to a conclusion. He had elevated himself to such a place. Who do you make yourself? You call yourself the bride. Who do you make yourself? &gt;&gt; You call yourself elected or chosen. And if you can't, there's a problem. &gt;&gt; It's a bigger problem. &gt;&gt; If you can't &gt;&gt; now for the people, I want to make this as a statement. And I actually wanted it on slides tonight, but I didn't have sufficient time for the people to ignore. Listen now, for the people to ignore, to resist, or to reject God's prepared men of choice is to declare by their actions that number one, God's choice of a man was the wrong choice. Number two, his preparation and molding of that man was faulty or insufficient. And number three, that he God is not successful in achieving his objective and his spiritual purpose in that in that age that he sent that man in. So they're they're essentially saying by anyone saying or feeling or having the sense we don't need this. We don't need a prophet. We don't need a messenger is to is to find fault directly with God. &gt;&gt; Your choosing was wrong. in fact is of a person where I'm coming down to is for that person or people of this age what they're really saying is when that prophet was revealing the secrets of the heart and people trembling in the presence of God and saying it is right it is true it is true they're saying that was wrong &gt;&gt; that ministry is wrong &gt;&gt; and then to say oh no that was all right? But then uh the teaching's wrong or something else is wrong. Now they've set themselves up as a god &gt;&gt; to make a determination of what is truth and what isn't truth. Good. &gt;&gt; See, the reason I'm bringing this is that I I I I want that the people have uh we need to have knowledge about the spirit that's in the world and how we deal with those things. And I this will be really helpful to you. And I'd like to make a statement to say that God's choice of a man is a wrong choice. Or to infer that by saying in action, we don't need them. We don't need it. We don't need the message. We don't need God's choice. Or to say that the preparation and the molding was insufficient or faulty at some in some way. And that and that is to say that God is not successful in achieving. In other words, he will not achieve his goal. Now, I'll just put it to you this way. Supposing that God chooses a vessel, a messenger, and sends him out and says, as brother Brandham said, I'm I'm sent to bring a message to forrun the second coming. I've been sent, Lord, uh, let me get your son a bride. If that was his ministry and someone's trying to circumvent that, how in the world are they going to be in the bride that the messenger that they want to reject or turn away from the very messenger was sent to get it? &gt;&gt; Now, that in my books, and you can write this down if you want, that is the ultimate insult to the face of God. Right. &gt;&gt; The Bible says Hebrews 12:25, "See that you refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escape not who refuse him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven." What was it that the angel said to uh the prophet? What was the angel that delivered the message said to him? If you can get the people to believe you, if you can get the people to believe you, nothing will stand before your prayers, not even cancer. This is interesting which I've never done before. 286 times in the message, Brother Brandham used the phrase, "You believe me to be God's prophet." 286 times. 92 times on top of that. Do you believe me to be God's prophet? 286 times. Do you believe me to be his prophet? And that believing I mean now what would a what would the purpose of him saying that to over 400 people directly and there are other variations of it many many there'd be hundreds what would be the purpose now I'm bringing it really down that would be a supreme deception if it were not the truth believe it. Right? &gt;&gt; And for people to believe it, they received an answer from God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; No one that I have ever heard on tape said, "No, I don't believe that." &gt;&gt; They all gave an affirmative. Believing was not to be limited to healing or miracles. But believing if a person was believing, if you actually said, I believe that God has sent this messenger, I believe that you are a prophet of God. Right away, we're faced with a we're faced with a another issue, and that is, are we believing? And now I could bring it right down to us here this evening. He also said believing is doing it. &gt;&gt; So that takes us a long ways beyond saying oh I go to Bible way. That doesn't really mean anything. You know that that doesn't mean anything. It says what do you do when you hear the message? Well that is that you know I'm a doer of the word &gt;&gt; not a hearer only. &gt;&gt; I'm a doer of the word. &gt;&gt; Now can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not a hearer only of the word. And and that brings it right down because in believing in believing in the message. Oh, I wish I could just tell you what's in my heart right now, but I don't want to necessarily get out in public, but I've had people that have, in fact, there some something has just taken place in the last about the last week. a man that I sat right in this church with. And I've just been finding out some of these things. I just found out today that brother uh brother Dave Chber and other brothers in this church have had contact with a man that came here to correct me on the godhead. And he was a a leader amongst Pentecostal people and over. And I found out since I just found out recently, in fact is some of it today. This man ended up with a complete nervous breakdown. His son is some leader. His son sat right in this church a number of times. and his son is some leader in some rock band, Christian rock band with with all kinds of, you know, studs and tattoos and all of this stuff and people and young people out there, waving like this, and has gone from a place of leadership, a place of respect, a place of esteem in the Christian community to become uh uh out of the ministry completely out of it driving a truck or driving a bus. I'm not saying that in a derogatory way. My heart is heavy. I feel so sorry that people have been confronted with something so beautiful, &gt;&gt; so clean, so so productive of holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. can look right at it, turn, walk right away and literally just sink. Because you know why? In believing is blessing and disbelieving is curse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not me. &gt;&gt; That's God's word. &gt;&gt; If you believe God's word, there's a blessing. you reject it and turn from it and say nasty things and evil things against it, it's a curse. &gt;&gt; And God said through Moses, "Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse. A blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day. A blessing if you obey it." The blessing went with obeying. Now, I'm going to take a a few minutes uh longer if I can. &gt;&gt; I want to look carefully. I'm going to just go to right angles now and look carefully at um I'd like to go back. If you go back to the beginning uh of something that God does, it will reveal his plan, his motive, his objective, and the thought behind his action. So when God made the first man, I'm just following my notes very closely because I want you to I want to be able to say these things in in statements. When God made the first man, Adam, we could say that God, the invisible God, was bringing his creative word to a higher level. Think about that just for a moment. Now, when God made the first man, Adam, we can say that the invisible God, which brother Brandham says he could not be understood, it'd be far too mysterious. And so that God of of that fills all time and space is now bringing a creature by his word. And he had set in motion a process in bringing his son Adam to become physical visible representation of himself on the earth. He set the process in motion. And I I you can write these down if you want, but he was bringing his quotation creation thoughts or thoughts of creation because God had thoughts of creation to a higher level by his thought expressing words because a prophet said that he spoke the word and the word was an expression of his thoughts. So he thought it first. So God thought about having a man and it was Adam. It could it could be no one else cuz it was Adam. That was a supreme choice in the back of and I you've got to think about this to see where I'm going in a in a little bit. And I just want to kind of point towards Sunday. So God way back in the eternities in his thoughts, he's determining what kind of a person, what kind of a son he wants to have. And the Bible tells us that that he made him. And I'm going to dwell on that in a few moments. That they made Adam. This isn't something that just happened. Oh, let there be a man. God thought about this. God had thoughts. And brother Brandham describes uh what kind of relationship they had and tells it in almost a not a melancholy way but such a uh a descriptive way of how God in his relationship with Adam and Adam and Eve and lay him to bed. And he describes it like, you know, I and my wife, he said, we go and we lay our son Joseph down and we look at him and and he says, you know, maybe she'll say, well, he has eyes just like you, dear. And uh he say, well, you know, he has he really looks like you. It has such an expression of your face or your mouth or something. and and and they say, you know, it's just such a kind of a warm feeling because you're looking at an expression of your own self. He talks about God taking Adam and Eve like just, you know, tucking him in at night. And he says how his heart must have felt when he looked upon them and saw that that was just an expression of himself, &gt;&gt; eternal God. I mean, it wasn't it wasn't you and I bringing forth children or you that have families. It wasn't you and I bringing something not knowing what's it going to look like and what kind of ears it's going to have and what kind of hands and fingers it's going to have. Nothing. God knew what it was going to be like. &gt;&gt; And God designed it way ahead of time. &gt;&gt; And when he saw it, then it came in something he could have fellowship with. And he was bringing his thoughts higher and higher and higher from the creatures of the earth and and all of creation. He is a creator and the creator is bringing higher and higher to finally have something that looks like him. Oh, what it what it meant to him to bring that into being. Now, friends, on Sunday, Lord willing, I I want you to know we talk about a bride being created. God didn't just that was not just an afterthought. &gt;&gt; Amen. using individuals, not just an afterthought. &gt;&gt; God had this in his mind back into the eternities to think exactly what it was going to be like. Every member, what they're going to be like, and he chose it. &gt;&gt; He selected it. &gt;&gt; And let it be known to us, that'll be a problem. And it's always going to be a problem because that is something that the world at large is irritated with &gt;&gt; and we'll never be able to recover from that. That happens to be a fact. That's an established fact. We're going to live it throughout our life and go out in a sweep of glory and the world is still Jesus said it hated you because it hated me &gt;&gt; and it hated him because he was the word and hates the bride because she's the word. hated for exactly the same reason. &gt;&gt; Just so you can see where I'm going. &gt;&gt; So now these were his uh creative thoughts, creation thoughts, thoughts of creation. He said in the message, I will restore. Now in the beginning when God made man in his image, the first man Adam was a man like God. He was a spirit man. Then we later on find after he'd made man in his image, there was no man to till the soil. So he put man in five senses to contact his earthly home. This is what he also did through the Old Testament. Did the same thing. Now it's I'm just taking a I I I just took like a model form there. This is what he did to bring one man. It was a contemplative thought. It was a a a purpose that God had in his mind. And he began, "Oh my, I tried today just to let my mind and my whole being go and and to think about and I just I love getting lost in my thoughts to think about this great great father, this God. I try to think about his power, his greatness, his holy, his magnificence. I try to let that affect me and to think that and and when I think about that, I think about how insignificant we are and I try to bridge that gap. And yet that God, he dains to stoop down &gt;&gt; and wants to fellowship with me, want to fellowship with you. that that's that's sometime but that's where our believing has to come in. That's when you have to believe it. &gt;&gt; Now there's a certain part of the earth I'm speaking almost you almost need your your imagination a wee bit now. So now God think in terms not of people so much but think in terms of God. He brought this earth into being. when he was bringing all of this into being and brother Ram talks about us and our bodies and the the elements that it's made out of 16 elements and so on and and when he he brought these elements from different places and so on and and was even making and forming an earth when he was doing that he was thinking of of you as an individual he was thinking of the very body that you're going to sit in you know this takes it out of the completely out of the mechanism of our birth by a sexual relationship. &gt;&gt; We had to come that way. But that was not the chosen way. &gt;&gt; And it takes it completely out of that. When you think when God in his great mind, he was not thinking of us coming down with all of our, you know, complexities and our, you know, complications of human life. That was not what was God was occupying his mind. He was thinking of sons and daughters like him. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the masterpiece, brother Brandham said, "He so perfected a redeemer," speaking of Christ, and I'll come to that in a moment. He so perfected a redeemer of man, so perfect, so godly. when this virgin-born son of the living God become so perfect and humble and in the image of God until the great master who had brought his life up through the prophets notice now he brought his life up that's why I stepped to Christ because it goes back say how it happened he brought his life up so perfect so absolutely perfect this redeemer of man and he brought him up through so humble but he brought him up his life up through the prophets and he was the fulfilling of all of the prophets. So now please stay with me. So now here's a here's here's the prophet and here's the people of that age and here's the saints of the Old Testament because God chose uh all humanity came out of the earth. All right? All humans came out of the earth in a physical body. But now God, just like he stooped down and took a certain part of the earth and made a man, Adam, now he he looks upon all humanity and he looks down and he chooses just a certain part of that clay. And he says, "Now this will be Abraham. And out of your seed is going to come forth a people." He knew they would become a nation. And these now this is going to be a certain part of all of the earth, all of the clay, all the human bodies that came up. All of us came up out of the earth. We're just part of the soil that's been transferred into a different form &gt;&gt; for a short time and then this body is going to go back to dust again. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And so God chose just a certain part of the earth, the clay. It's now in a higher form, but he chose it and said, "You're going to be my people." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to use you just like he used the clay that he molded and made for Adam and breathed into him. And Adam became a living soul. And he became the he became the expression on earth of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; And God took a piece of clay and and breathed that into him. that image that he had made of himself, breathed it into him. Now he takes a whole because they fell. His bride fell. Now he takes a whole group of people that also are part of the earth that just came into a higher form. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Good &gt;&gt; through the sexual birth, a natural human birth. But he chooses that fallen earth, that clay, corrupted clay, because out of that, he's going to choose one here. He's going to choose an Abraham. He's going to choose a Sarah. He's going to choose Isaac. He's going to choose a Jacob. Going to choose a Joseph. And so Jacob was a deceiver. And and uh and Isaac Isaac told a lie. Abraham told a lie. And and that was irrespective of that, God chose them. God chose them for a specific purpose and a specific objective. But the nations of the world were aggravated with that choice, &gt;&gt; irritated with that choice. It it it ground on them. &gt;&gt; And the fact that they are to have a land, the fact God did when he made a choice of the people, he also made a choice of a place. Says, "You're the people and this is where you're going to be and I'm giving it to you." And that was an irritation way back there and still an irritation &gt;&gt; for one reason. It was God's choice. &gt;&gt; The choice is the problem. The selection of God is the problem. And if and and anybody ought to see it. It's it's it's it's his archeneemy, Satan, who's in opposition to anything God chooses &gt;&gt; or anybody that God chooses. He's in opposition or anything that God speaks. And so when God speaks truth, the world is opposed to it. &gt;&gt; They're in opposition to it. It irritates them. [Music] &gt;&gt; Because when God speaks, that's the only word. &gt;&gt; When God gives a message, that's the only message. &gt;&gt; When God chooses a person, that's the only person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just this one and and 50 50 more that'll line up. That's the only person. And God says, "You're going to do this." He's the only one that's going to do it &gt;&gt; and I'm going to raise you up for a generation. He's the only one that God's going to use that generation. And so now we move along and he's got a group of people and and out of that out of that group of people comes comes a prophet and comes men and women and God chose them at different levels to do specific things. and brings a Moses, brings a Samuel, brings a David, and he brings kings and he brings prophets and minor prophets and brings them. And they all have their particular station and and out of this earth when one of them lived his life which was the word for that season. Please hang on close. Now, when that prophet, brother Brandham said, now they they were bringing forth Christ. So when that prophet lived his portion of word for that time and was done, it was completed. A part of Christ was formed. &gt;&gt; And then the next one came and another p another part of Christ was formed. And Christ was being formed formed all down. And finally here he emerged and came on the scene. &gt;&gt; The perfect son of God. But he had been in formation all through God forming him, forming him, molding him. &gt;&gt; So he had to be rejected in Samuel because he was going to be rejected. He had to be spit on in David cuz he was going to be spit on. He had to be a father like Abraham was a father. He had to be all of those things. And he because God was forming him all through that. And that's why his masterpiece had to have the had to have the foundations of Abraham in faith and Isaac and Jacob and grace and and and Joseph in perfection. And he's building on his form and brings forth his son, &gt;&gt; one that was just like him &gt;&gt; out of the earth. &gt;&gt; And he came in a body of earth. He had to come in a body of earth because he had to take now the the word because he was and the scripture says he was made the word. Now he's formed by the word and he's made the word and the word was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I want to get get your mind away from the fact he was just made flesh and he was formed in the womb of Mary. That wasn't it. That was just the kind of the final act. &gt;&gt; He was formed all through the centuries from that that piece of clay called Hebrew children. &gt;&gt; And up out of that Hebrew children came Christ being formed and formed and formed and part of the word. And when the word was fulfilled, it was laid down. It was already it was already a fact. It was a part of Christ. And that's why brother Bram said it was Christ in Noah. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in Abraham. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in David. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in Isaiah. &gt;&gt; Is Christ in. And when that man lived his life, he was chosen of God. That piece of clay chosen of God to live out a certain part of the word. And when it was laid down, the Messiah, the redeemer, everything was formed. Yes. &gt;&gt; And then finally the time came when when a a little virgin believed. &gt;&gt; And then there was a conception in her womb and she brought forth a body because now the word had to take the body as a sacrifice to Calvary. &gt;&gt; And so it was the word in him and he lived a very short life but the word the word in him walked him. Amen. &gt;&gt; To Calvary. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I I read today and how how the prophet describes him. He was born in a stable &gt;&gt; because he was a lamb. &gt;&gt; He was led He was led to the slaughter with a rope around him because because sheep and lambs are led by with a rope around him. Everything about him was a lamb. But he had been formed that all through the centuries. And now this was the kind of the concluding climactic act of his life because he had to take the flesh as a sacrifice and bring this cursed earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. had to bring this cursed earth to Calvary and let men who are already under judgment uh condemn him and kill him and go to the go to the tomb. But it was not possible because he was the word in flesh. It was not possible that he would that he would see corruption. And the spirit of God moved upon him and he raised up out of the tomb victorious over death, hell, and the grave. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's choice. &gt;&gt; But when he came and he began to express, you can't hide God's choosing &gt;&gt; and he began because of his because of his choosing because he was the son of God. what he spoke took place and the others who couldn't do it. You see, I want you to see this. I would just give anything if I could transport this congregation this evening into one of brother Brandham's meetings so you could see with your eyes and hear with your ears that voice and that you could be sitting where you're sitting and have you be singled out and something that's crushing on your heart like you called out a little woman and he was over in Europe, I believe in Switzerland and he says, "You're holding that baby." He said, "You're have a desire something with that baby." But he says, "What you really need is salvation. You're not saved." And I thought, you know what, grace of God, a little young mother holding a baby, an infant that was in need of prayer, but here a messenger sent from heaven, sent from God, would deal with her soul and just simply just lead her to Christ right there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How marvelous. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I would love to be able to do that here this evening, but you see, he was chosen for that. &gt;&gt; And if I even attempted it, I would be an impersonator. &gt;&gt; And the impersonators raised up. &gt;&gt; Kora, Dayan, Abraham, all impersonators. And they were in this day as well. And when the choice of God came, all kinds of others came in said, "Well, I can do that. I can do that. See, even prayer lines. Prayer lines. Brother Brandon was the first that I ever heard of, even read of that had a prayer line. &gt;&gt; That that was a unique thing to one man's ministry. &gt;&gt; Can I go on just a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; So, he brought his life up through the prophets. He was so perfect until God seeing this he smoked him and said and he as he cried out speak as Michelangelo did speak he said you say is that so St. Mark 9 and7 we find upon the mount transfiguration when there stood Moses the law there stood Elijah the prophets so brother Brandham refers to mount transfiguration he says there stood the law and the prophets all the way back from the patriarchs the fathers the law and the prophets and all of them standing there we hear a voice coming down from the cloud said this is my beloved son, hear ye him. So he singles him out beyond the law and the prophets and the patriarchs and all of them, Peter, James, and John that were standing there, they were sons of the Hebrews. &gt;&gt; All they knew was the law and the prophets. Now, the voice that they heard, and Peter refers to it in his in his epistle, the voice that they heard singled out this one as a choosing even above all of that, &gt;&gt; above every prophet, above every every patriarch. As great as Abraham was, here's one greater. &gt;&gt; A young man that they ate with. a young man 30 31 32 33 a young man that hey listen friends because it's historical that may seem simple to you try to pick out somebody in this day and age at this time and and that selection the fact that God chooses an individual that is a that is a real source of a of difficulty and and you need to be ready for that Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you're wrestling with it all the time, you know, to to be accepted and everything else. You might be accepted as an individual, but the thing you believe will never be accepted by the world. &gt;&gt; And that's one of the best things that you can just get and put that in your packs. What you believe will never be accepted by the world. &gt;&gt; It'll never be popular by the world. In fact, it's the fact that God even gave you the the kind of life you emulate, the kind of life you express, the kind of power that is there. It's just resident. &gt;&gt; You don't have to you don't have to try to generate it. It's just there. &gt;&gt; You have a certain appearance. It's just there. &gt;&gt; People know you're different right away. They may not be able to identify it, but they know it's different. &gt;&gt; And you'd think they would love it. &gt;&gt; Right. They admire it at the same time irritated by it. &gt;&gt; Am I getting right to the point? &gt;&gt; See, all through life, &gt;&gt; I'm restraining myself. I could preach, but I I'm I'm holding myself back all the way back from the patriarchs and the fathers and the law and the prophets standing there to hear a voice coming down from the cloud said, "This is my beloved son. Hear ye him." And if they're going to hear, listen to this closely. If they're going to hear, he's got to speak. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand's making a point because he wasn't just speaking back there 2,000 years ago. The same one that was on the mountain was speaking today. &gt;&gt; That was God's choosing. &gt;&gt; He's got to speak. And if he's going to speak, if they're going to hear, he's got to speak. It was just a few days before he was smitten. This is my son whom I'm pleased to dwell in. I've molded him. &gt;&gt; Not in 33 years only. He was molded because he was living out the reflection of all of those people. Amen. &gt;&gt; I like what someone said and I can't say it exactly as they did but they said here this this loaf &gt;&gt; this bread of life was ground through the suffering of humanity. He was ground so fine to make the flour that could make the loaf a living loaf a living bread &gt;&gt; for us to eat and partake of. I've molded him. I've been 4,000 years. Now, see, I I want you to understand this message just isn't my thought. I've been 4,000 years bringing him to this. &gt;&gt; Not 33 years. I've been 4,000 years bringing him to this. The son of God, the second Adam, being molded out of the earth after the earth had come to a higher form. It wasn't just dirt laying there anymore, but now it had come into humanity. But God's choosing is all the way along. God making his choice. And he perfected one, his masterpiece. Now, I'm going to be just about 5 minutes. I'm just going to close. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God, created he him, male and female created he them. In the identified masterpiece, he said, "Now, and when he made Adam, that first man, how perfect it was. He looked like God." I want to just study this. He and he made man in his own image. And um I probably won't get into it completely. Uh but um I want to bring one thought because this word, let us make man in our own image. The Bible also says, "And God said, let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth." And it was so. I'd love to have had this on the uh on the uh screen. Perhaps I can do it for Sunday morning. But when the scripture says, and you can read it at Genesis 1:11, and God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit, and the yielding of the seed, and the yielding of the fruit, two different words completely. And the one yielding is to to sew to seow seed or to produce uh yielding of seed. But the other one is exactly as when God said, "Let us make man." Let us make man. Just hold it now. And that one is yielding fruit. yielding fruit. Yielding in the same word is make. Let us make man. In other words, man will be yielding or bringing forth fruit. Let us make man in our image because God was one that was bringing forth. God was fruitful. God was bringing forth a children and that was that was indicating I want you to get this now as I close. God was he was giving a powerful statement. Let us make man not just to produce seed that would be scattered but to produce fruit. He's going to produce fruit. And then he says to the tree you'll yield and make yielding seed. That's like to be sown but you will yield fruit. And actually in the Hebrew it was even to become pregnant. It's actually written right in the in the in the dictionary actually to be become pregnant. You will actually yield fruit. And so now in this making let us make man. And I'll just stop here now because I want to take some time on Sunday morning because God God in his making I I I want I want to bear this uh and and bring this so make it so emphatic for the people because I want you to enlarge your belief, enlarge your scope of understanding of your presence here and to let you know that God had this in mind and the Bible is saying I want you to be occupied with this thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to believe on him whom God hath sent and I have not found any message that so takes us as believers. Where did you hear it before? You came from a multitude of churches. Where did you hear before? You came from the thoughts of God. From the mind of God. So, we're not just go back 4,000 years, but go back into the very mind and thoughts of God. And what did God think when he was thinking about you sitting here this evening? I want you to go home thinking about that. What did God think about? What did God have in mind? What was his purpose? What was his objective? Why did he allow me to come to this age? What what what purpose do I have on the earth? God knows why I'm here. &gt;&gt; God has designed this whole thing. &gt;&gt; This has been definitive in the mind of God. He knew precisely what he wanted me to do. And I'm here. And now I've heard the message that he sent. and I believe on him whom God has sent. Oh, you stand in a tremendous a tremendous uh benefited place to believe on him whom God hath sent because now think about God's choosing a messenger. You know something friends, brother Brham's language when he first started to bring the message, he used language concerning like the promiscuous society which we've become so acquainted with. But he used it and he spoke about those things that caused us as ministers and myself included to cringe because there were it was terminology that wasn't used over the pullpit &gt;&gt; when he spoke about the serpent seed and spoke about things so openly. He was way ahead of his time. &gt;&gt; God God crafted him. &gt;&gt; God chose him. God gave him the vocabulary. &gt;&gt; He spoke about tectonics and the crust of the earth and and the movement and the shifting of it like like scientists. In fact, there's a scientist told me, "We only thought of that in our bedrooms until about 1977." And here he's speaking about it back in the 60s and the late 50s, talking about the the the injured cell from a wound and how a cell goes wild and describes a cancer, describes the tumor, describes its roots and how it dries up and all of these things. He like like he was a a medical uh physician of some sort. spoke about the science and the universe and and how the planets and their rotation and all those things in the earth how it tipped at one time and changed the whole planet system of our planet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Like he was a like he was a scientist. &gt;&gt; Where did that wisdom come from? &gt;&gt; A seventh grade educated Kuckian. Never. &gt;&gt; It was the molding of God. &gt;&gt; It was the education of God. come out of God's school. &gt;&gt; Where did John the Baptist get all this? Where'd he get it? Out in the wilderness. Absolutely. Where God, he was educated by God. &gt;&gt; And you and I have become the beneficiaries of such a thing, such a choosing, &gt;&gt; such a message, &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, you you have things on your on your walls that they haven't got in the in the museums of this land. That's right. &gt;&gt; You might cower when I say that. You might say, "Well, should we think that?" I think that you should. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think you ought to occupy yourself with God's choosing. &gt;&gt; God has chosen &gt;&gt; us to be an example. &gt;&gt; And it's not my business who else he chose or who he doesn't choose. And that's one of the things we face soon as people become believers. What about them? Or what about this one? What about them? They're good people. We have nothing to say about that. wonderful people, fine people, and then you have a messenger saying it's such a comfort to it's not the people, it's the system that that's that's holding them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I think I've actually made my point tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're on God's choosing, &gt;&gt; the chosen of God. something that just cannot be popular and something that cannot be accepted by the general population, the general public and whoever hears this because you see I don't have I don't have I'm not one to say it's just God choosing within these four walls. I don't know who he chooses, but I know one thing. He chose me to hear what I've heard. And what I've heard has been a transforming power in my life. And I know one thing even by scientific by the scientific things that God has allowed us that this messenger came and truth came out of his mouth. &gt;&gt; And truth is what we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been appointed to this certain time, friends, &gt;&gt; so you think you have something to go home with and think about [Music] &gt;&gt; till Sunday. Sunday, Lord willing, I want to take the rest of it now cuz I've just laid a foundation, bit of foundation. I want to go from there and and preach you on you have to forgive me. You know, I stumbled around a we bit cuz I'm trying to hold myself back and I feel like a racehorse that's been, you know, crippled and put big big weights on its legs so it can't move about. And you've been good. You've been quiet. You haven't said sickum too many times. So, all right. God bless you. We thank him. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank him for this word. I thank him for this message. &gt;&gt; It's just wonderful. &gt;&gt; Why don't we just stand, shall we? Lord, we're here tonight to give you thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; How we thank you, oh God. You're the author of salvation, &gt;&gt; the author of eternal life. &gt;&gt; You've brought forth Jesus Christ. And Lord, we've just finished celebrating and remembering a an Easter time, but Lord, the world, what do they know about it? you know, some bonnets or bunnies or chicks or something. What a disgrace. What a shame. Oh, God. Such a glorious thing. Up from the grave he arose. &gt;&gt; Victory. Victorious over all of his foes. How we rejoice tonight because we raised with him. Your messenger said we raised with him. We are now resurrected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We're not down in the doldrums, down in the in the gloom of this world, but we've been raised in a resurrection. We've been beneficiaries of it. And you've waved over us this wave shave. How we bless your name tonight. Lord, thank you for this attention, the congregation, the keen interest, the desire that they have to hear, to hear your word, to lodge it in their heart. And I pray oh God that you will take it and let it be just a profusion of life. Let it become fruitful in their life. Give us oh God a glorious time in the coming days and bring us together on the appointed time on the Lord's day. We'll be here to worship you Lord. We'll be here to give you praise. We thank you for it. We dedicate ourselves and our lives to you and in your service in Jesus Christ's name. Make us a real witness in the testimony, oh God. And we rejoice in your selection. We rejoice in your choosing, oh God. We rejoice that it's no good thing that we have done. It is grace, grace, amazing grace. We bless your name. We praise your holy name. Amen. And amen. I think we'll just sing the old song. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. Could you lift it up and mean every word of it? I'm sure you can. Amazing [Music] grace, how sweet the sound that save like me. I was now [Music] see the last verse please.

[Music] Dear Father, we do not know what tomorrow holds, but we know that you have it in your hand. You have every life in your hand. You have our breath in your hand. And Lord, we pray that because you know the beginning from the end, we just commit ourselves to you. Each one. And I'm praying on behalf of each one that's within the sound of my voice in this building tonight. Lord, those that are streaming, oh God, give them a glimpse. I pray give us all give me a glimpse Lord just by faith by the six sense that I might be able to just look and peer and see a little more see a little broader scope of what your plan and what you've prepared for them that love you. Oh Lord I can say tonight we love your appearing. We love what we've seen. We love your presence, Lord. And we want you just to make yourself even more evident, more evident, Lord, nearer to us, oh God. Bring your mighty works amongst us, Father. Hear the prayers that have been prayed tonight, Lord. And the prayers that were prayed throughout the day, oh God. They've entered in and there are incense rising up before you. Oh God, come and glorify yourself amongst us. We'll be very very careful to give you all the praise there. No flesh will glory in your presence. No minister Lord will glory in your presence. We set ourselves aside. Oh Lord Jesus, be glorified. Be glorified. Oh Lord, come amongst us and be glorified. Oh, your name is worthy. It's the only worthy name. Lord Jesus, as we go, may your name be upon our lips. And may we, oh God, think of the words that were uttered from heaven. This is my beloved son. Hear ye him, oh Lord, that you have allowed us, allowed us this honor, this privilege, this position that you have brought us to. And now that we can be a voice on your behalf. Oh God, make us faithful. Let us be a voice. Though the world may not want to hear it, yet we will speak it. We will continue to say it. We will continue to live it by the power of the Holy Spirit. Send your spirit mightily upon us, oh God. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, if there's one here or more that have not been baptized and filled with your Holy Spirit. Send your spirit upon them. Even now, oh God, create such a hunger within their heart that they can't shake it. They will call out to you. Oh God, fill me or I die. Fill me. I cannot continue on. I pray you'll fill them, Lord. Fill them to overflowing and give us all another baptism. I pray, oh God, don't let us be satisfied with where we were yesterday or where we were today. Oh God, don't let us be satisfied. I pray this thirst will become so great it'll become painful. Let us hunger and thirst after righteousness. Bless this congregation, Lord, as we part ways and go from this place. May your presence continue with us in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory. We thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. Oh, I'm here to praise you, Lord. We're here to give you praise. What a lovely name, the name of Jesus. Oh, we bless your name, Lord. That's so good to our souls, Lord. We feel such a release. We feel such a joy when we can open our mouth and give vent to what's in our soul, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
