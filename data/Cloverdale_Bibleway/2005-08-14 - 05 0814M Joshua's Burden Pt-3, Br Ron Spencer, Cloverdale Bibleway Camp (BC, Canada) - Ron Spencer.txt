========================================
We're going to be turning to the word now at this time. Let's be praying that God would just anoint our brother Spencer to speak exactly what God wants us to hear this morning. I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor. Give you praise. You are the light. the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name. I bless your name, Lord. I give you honor, Lord. We give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. &gt;&gt; I bless your We bless your name. We bless your name. We bless your name. We give you honor. &gt;&gt; We give you honor. you praise. Give him praise and bless the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. &gt;&gt; And he who we bless said, "He that receiveth you receiveth me." We receive you, Brother Ron, as we would receive him. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads before him. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we thank you, Father. for what you have done. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Father, that you would come and fellowship with us for these days, that you would anoint our lips and anoint our hearts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe it came a different way than we were even expecting. But that's just how you do. You come in that personal way. And Lord, may this morning be no different. Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; we have blessed your name. &gt;&gt; You are the King of Kings. &gt;&gt; And the Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; Your name is great to be praised this morning. All the prophets of all the ages will stand that day and give you glory. &gt;&gt; The mightiest men that ever put their feet in shoe leather. &gt;&gt; But Lord, I'm thankful that there was one that was worthy to take the book. &gt;&gt; All of our names were in that book. Father, &gt;&gt; we were on your mind before the foundation of the world. and sin had so gripped our lives. But thank you for the redemption power of Jesus Christ. I thank you for the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Lord, as we turn to your word just now, I ask you that you would anoint this body this morning. May you anoint vocal cords. And Lord, may you anoint our hearts and our ears to receive your word, Father. &gt;&gt; And I pray the angel of the Lord would come into this tent, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just pray that you will speak to us in a special way. We thank you for what you have done, what you are doing, and what you are about to do. We thank you for it and we give you 100% glory for it in the name of Jesus Christ. And the congregation said, "Amen." Amen. Amen. Amen. Always I always have to find a fly somewhere. Amen. We're glad to be in the house of the Lord this morning, aren't we? I certainly would like to thank brother Ed for inviting me here and I have had a wonderful time. You guys have just about killed me, but I've had a wonderful time. Amen. I certainly do appreciate all of his hospitality and your hospitality. And I would like to think that I could shake every one of your hands, but if I can't do it here, I'll do it there. And I just like to thank my wife for coming and we certainly do appreciate her for being able to come. I would like to thank they won't they don't want me to do this but I would like to thank brother Joe and sister Bobby for everything that they did to make this this trip a wonderful experience. &gt;&gt; They run a five-star hotel. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I thought they was going to feed me like a Chinese pig. I thought they was just going to keep putting the food in me. You need this for your strength. You need this food for your strength. But I really do appreciate them and everything that they did. They didn't ask for that, but I just want to thank them personally. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. If &gt;&gt; you will turn with me to Joshua chapter 23. I believe today is the last service. So, we're not going to leave no stone unturned. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to do it quickly, but we're not going to leave any of them unturned. So, here we go. Amen. Amen. And you can already tell that this body don't hold up to these three-hour sermons. So, amen. So, there's no need getting nervous. Joshua chapter 23 verse 8. But cleave unto the Lord your God as ye have done unto this day. For the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong. But as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day. Verse 10, one man of you shall chase a thousand. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the Lord your God, he is it. He it is that fightth for you, &gt;&gt; as he hath promised you. &gt;&gt; That is a covenant of God. &gt;&gt; And God does not change his mind about his word. &gt;&gt; And I want you to just read this with me, Lord, as we as we're doing it. This is my covenant. One man of you shall chase a thousand. For the Lord your God, he it is that fightth for you, as he hath promised you. &gt;&gt; You may be seated this morning. Now we understand that when God swore by himself, he could swear by no greater. And he swore to Abraham, the father of us all. He swore to Abraham that thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to understand he deposited that into the natural seed of Abraham. But they must tap into that resource THAT GOD HAS DEPOSITED THERE. Now he didn't leave his spiritual seed out. Amen. &gt;&gt; One day I was I was at an airport and they had had had basically basically cancelled two flights in front of me. I had already been almost two days in journey to go to a certain place and I was sitting in actually in Utah and I was there and uh I was standing before the man and he told me he said you're going to have to wait five more hours. And so I I I told him, I said, 'You know, there's certainly something that should be done. I said, 'You know, I could have rode a a horse. And he said, 'You know, he said, if a pony is all that you need, we can certainly get you that. He said, but I'm willing to buy your supper for the evening. And so there was a fellow behind me that was having the same problem. And so we went and we had supper together. And as we were sitting there with my wife and we were sitting sitting enjoying dinner and I prayed over the meal and and and and I just want to bring it to this this evening, you know, he he said uh he said, YOU KNOW, I'M A JEW. And I said, I am too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; He said, "No, REALLY, I'M THE NATURAL SEED of Abraham." I said, "Well, I'm the spiritual seed of Abraham. And he said, 'Well, I would like for you to be able, he was a doctor. He was an optitian from Florida. He said, 'I would like for you to be able to tell me that in kind of layman's terms what that means. I said, WHEN YOUR GREAT GREAT GREAT ALL THE WAY BACK, ABRAHAM was sitting there AND HE WAS TALKING TO GOD AND GOD TOLD HIM TO LOOK AT THE SAND OF THE OF the sea and COUNT THEM. I SAID, NOW THAT WAS LOOKING AT YOU. I SAID, "BUT IF YOU'LL NOTICE, ONLY A FEW SCRIPTURES LATER, HE TOLD HIM TO LOOK UP." &gt;&gt; AND I SAID, "THAT'S THE SPIRITUAL SEED OF ABRAHAM." &gt;&gt; AND HE COULDN'T COUNT THEM EITHER. AND I SAID, "ONE OF THOSE STARS OUT THERE, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE. IT MIGHT BE OBLIVIOUS TO THE WHOLE WORLD, BUT ONE OF THOSE STARS REPRESENT ME. So he told me, he says, "Well, I bet you're going to TELL ME ABOUT THIS JESUS WHICH IS called the Christ." I said, "We've got five hours." &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE TELL ME ABOUT THIS JESUS." HE SAID, "WANTED TO CONVERT ME TO CHRISTIANITY." I said, "You have not heard OF THE JESUS OF today &gt;&gt; of the son of man word that has been REVEALED TO THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST." I SAID, "DO YOU MIND IF I JUST START TALKING TO YOU?" AND WE JUST WENT RIGHT INTO IT. WITHIN FIVE HOURS, HE WAS SO THRILLED ABOUT WHAT HE HAD HEARD. HE GAVE HIS HEART TO THE LORD RIGHT THERE AT THE TABLE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS SIGNED A COVENANT WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; AND I believe, AS WE HAVE TALKED OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, THAT WE'RE A PART OF THAT COVENANT. I believe that he SIGNED IT WITH HIS VERY OWN BLOOD. &gt;&gt; NOW, I want you to just notice a couple of covenant promises in Deuteronomy chapter 28 before I get too excited. And he said, "And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to all all of his commandments, which I command thee this day, that the Lord THY GOD WILL SET THEE ON HIGH ABOVE all nations of the earth, and all of these blessings shall come upon thee, &gt;&gt; AND OVERTAKE THEE, IF THOU SHALT HEARKEN UNTO THE UNTO THE VOICE OF THE LORD THY GOD. BLESSED THOU BE IN THE CITY. BLESSED THOU BE IN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, BROTHER, THAT WAS TO THE JEWS. BUT WE'RE HIS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; AND HE HAS COMMANDED A BLESSING ON YOU. HE'LL BLESS YOUR JOB. HE'LL BLESS YOUR HOME. HE'LL BLESS YOUR CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, BROTHER RON, THAT SOUNDS LIKE CHARISMATIC." I WANT YOU TO JUST UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT CHARISMATIC. THAT'S WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I just believe the word. So here we are. Great quote book. HE SAID THIS SHALL HE SAID BLESSED THOU SHALT BE IN THE CITY. BLESSED THOU SHALT BE IN THE FIELD. BLESSED SHALL BE THE FRUIT OF THY BODY. HE SAYS THE FRUIT OF THY GROUND, THE FRUIT OF THY CATTLE, THE INCREASE OF THY KIND, THE FLOCKS OF THY SHEEP. BLESSED SHALL BE THY BASKET AND THY STORE. BLESSED SHALT THOU BE WHEN THOU COMEST IN, AND BLESSED SHALL BE WHEN THOU GOEST OUT. THE LORD SHALL CAUSE &gt;&gt; THE LORD SHALL CAUSE THINE ENEMIES THAT RISE UP AGAINST THEE TO BE SMITTEN &gt;&gt; BEFORE THY FACE, AND THEY SHALL COME OUT AGAINST THEE ONE WAY, AND FLEE BEFORE THEE SEVEN WAYS. believe we're going to have a good time. &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 20, he says, "And God spake all of these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, and out of the house of bondage, and thou shalt have no OTHER GODS BEFORE ME. GOD WANTS FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S SIMPLE, BROTHER RON. GOD REQUIRES FIRST PLACE &gt;&gt; for this covenant to work. &gt;&gt; HE MUST NOT SHARE. HE SAID, "THOU SHALT NOT MAKE UNTO THEE any graven image or any likeness about anything that IS IN HEAVEN ABOVE, OR THAT IS IN THE EARTH BENEATH, or is the water under the earth. And thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them. For I am THE LORD THY GOD, AND I'M A JEALOUS GOD. THIS AND THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS UPON THE CHILDREN, UNTO the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, &gt;&gt; AND SHOWETH MERCY UPON THOUSANDS OF THEM THAT LOVE ME, AND keep my commandments. and thou shalt not take the name OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN, FOR THE LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. &gt;&gt; IN CHAPTER 23, HE SAYS THIS. HE SAYS, "THERE SHALL NOTHING CAST their young, NOR BE BARREN IN THY LAND. The number of the days WILL I FULFILL. I WILL SEND MY FEAR BEFORE THEE, AND WILL DESTROY ALL THE PEOPLE TO whom thou shalt come. AND I WILL MAKE ALL of the thine enemies turn their backs unto thee, AND I WILL SEND HORNETS BEFORE THEE, AND WHICH SHALL DRIVE OUT THE HIVITE, AND THE CANONITE, and the and THE HIGHITE FROM BEFORE THEE. OH, I LIKE THAT. DON'T YOU? &gt;&gt; I like a God THAT WANTS TO HELP US FIGHT OUR BATTLES. &gt;&gt; Psalms chapter 23, very familiar. He said, "THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD. &gt;&gt; He is my husband. &gt;&gt; HE HAS TAKEN ALL MY RESPONSIBILITIES. &gt;&gt; HE'S TAKEN ALL MY SHAME." &gt;&gt; And notice what HE SAYS. AND I SHALL NOT WANT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A SERMON WITHIN ITSELF. I SHALL NOT WANT. HE HAS PROMISED ME HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He maketh me to lie DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES. HE LEADTH ME BESIDE THE STILL WATERS. HE RESTORETH MY SOUL. HE LEADTH ME IN THE PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. AND YAY, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL, FOR THOU ART WITH ME. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO BE A PERSONAL GOD TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, I AM THAT I AM. &gt;&gt; I WILL DRIVE OUT YOUR ENEMIES. YAY, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear NO EVIL, FOR THOU ART WITH ME. THY ROD, THY STAFF THAT COMFORT ME. THOU PREPAREST THE TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MINE ENEMIES. THOU ANOINTEST MY HEAD WITH ALL. MY CUP RUNTH OVER. SURELY GOODNESS AND MERCY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, AND I WILL DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon was going to PREACH THE RAPTURE, HE WENT TO THIS SCRIPTURE, PSALMS 27. THE LORD ELOHIM IS MY LIGHT AND MY SALVATION. &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear? &gt;&gt; THE LORD IS THE STRENGTH OF MY LIFE. OF WHOM SHALL I BE AFRAID? WHEN THE WICKED, EVEN MINE ENEMIES AND MY FOES CAME UPON ME TO EAT UP MY FLESH, THEY STUMBLED AND FELL. THOUGH AN HOST SHOULD ENCAMP AGAINST ME, MY HEART SHALL NOT FEAR. THOUGH WAR SHOULD RISE AGAINST ME, AND THIS WILL I BE CONFIDENT, ONE THING HAVE I DESIRED OF THE LORD, &gt;&gt; THAT THOU WILL I SEEK AFTER, THAT I MAY DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD. ALL ALL ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; TO BEHOLD THE BEAUTY OF THE LORD AND TO INQUIRE IN THE TEMP IN HIS TEMPLE. &gt;&gt; FOR IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE HE SHALL HIDE ME. &gt;&gt; HE SHALL HIDE ME. IN HIS PAVILION, IN THE SECRET OF HIS TABERNACLE, SHALL HE HIDE ME. EVEN IN THE MIDST OF YOUR TROUBLE, HE CAN GIVE YOU REST. &gt;&gt; You can BE IN A TOTAL SABBATH IN THE MIDST OF A TROUBLES OF YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; He shall set me up on a rock. &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us? Yes. &gt;&gt; John 15:1, he says, "I am the true vine, and my father is the husband. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it might bring forth more fruit." Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. ABIDE IN ME AND I IN YOU. As the BRANCH HAS BEARETH FORTH BIRTH beareth forth FRUIT OF ITSELF, EXCEPT IT ABIDE IN THE VINE. NO MORE CAN YE EXCEPT YOU ABIDE IN ME. I am the vine &gt;&gt; and ye are the branches. &gt;&gt; HE THAT ABIDETH IN ME. NOTICE THIS IS COVENANT PROMISES. YES, &gt;&gt; I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT FELLOWSHIPPING WITHIN THE COVENANT THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; Watch what he's saying. I AM THE VINE AND YE ARE THE BRANCHES. &gt;&gt; HE THAT IS ABIDETH IN ME AND I AM HIM, THE SAME BRINGETH FORTH MUCH FRUIT. FOR WITHOUT ME, YE CAN DO NOTHING. IF A MAN ABIDE NOT IN ME, HE HAS CAST FORTH AS A BRANCH AND IS WITHERED AND MEN GATHER THEM AND CAST THEM INTO THE FIRE AND THEY ARE BURNED. BROTHER RAM'S FAVORITE SCRIPTURE. IF YOU ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN YOU, YOU SHALL ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND IT SHALL BE DONE UNTO YOU. &gt;&gt; Herein or here IS WHERE THE COVENANT IS GLORIFIED. HEREIN IS MY FATHER GLORIFIED THAT YE bear much fruit. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO SHALL YE BE MY DISCIPLES. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You know when YOU WALK UP TO A TREE, JUST to give you a REAL SIMPLE ANALOGY, WHEN YOU WALK UP TO A TREE, YOU DON'T SAY WHAT A BEAUTIFUL TRUNK. &gt;&gt; What beautiful branches. &gt;&gt; WHAT BEAUTIFUL FRUIT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT BEAUTIFUL FRUIT. &gt;&gt; NOW IF IT IS OF THE ORIGINAL SEED, IT REPLICATES THE LIFE THAT IS WITHIN IT. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, HE SAID, "ALL POWERS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH IS GIVEN INTO MY HANDS. GO AND I'LL GO WITH YOU. WHATEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH, I'LL BIND IN HEAVEN." HE SAYS, "WHAT YOU LOOSE ON EARTH, I'LL LOOSE IN HEAVEN." OH, IF THE GREAT HOLY CHURCH ONLY REALIZED ITS POWER TO DO THESE THINGS, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH DOUBT AND FEAR AND TREMBLING. WONDER IF IT WILL HAPPEN. COULD IT HAPPEN? AS LONG AS THAT EXISTS, THE CHURCH CAN NEVER STAND UPRIGHT. WHEN EVERY TALK OF FEAR IS VANISHED, THE HOLY SPIRIT IS COMPLETELY IN CONTROL of the church. THEN ALL FEARS ARE GONE. AND THE CHURCH HAS THE POWER. HE SAID THEY HAVE EVERYTHING THAT HEAVEN OWNS IS BEHIND THEM. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THEY'RE AMBASSADORS OF THE THRONE. &gt;&gt; AN AMBASSADOR OF CHRIST HAS THE AUTHORITY. AUTHORITY IS YOUR POSITION. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'M JUST SITTING IN MY PEW. BUT WHETHER YOU REALIZE OR NOT, JUST SITTING IN YOUR PEW IS A VICTORY. THAT'S GOOD PREACHING. &gt;&gt; JUST COMING TO YOUR POST OF DUTY IS ANOTHER VICTORY. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I DIDN'T HARDLY DO MUCH BETWEEN LAST SUNDAY AND THIS SUNDAY JUST TO STILL BE STANDING. IT'S A VICTORY &gt;&gt; IN THE DARKEST OF LAYA &gt;&gt; IN SATAN'S EDEN. GOD HAS A COVENANT WITH YOU. I WILL KEEP YOU. I WILL LIVE IN YOU. &gt;&gt; Go ye into all the world FOR YOU ARE THE WITNESSES AFTER THE HOLY GHOST HAS COME UPON YOU. And what is a WITNESS IS AN AMBASSADOR IS COME TO THE THRONE. THE WITNESS TO SOMETHING WHICH WELL THE WHOLE POWERS OF HEAVEN IS RIGHT IN YOUR HANDS. HE SAYS WHY DO WE SIT AND THE CHURCH IS BARREN AND WE SIT LIKE A DOORMAT? IS BECAUSE WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THESE THINGS. EPHESIANS PARALLELS JOSHUA. HE SAID, "NOW, IF THE UNITED STATES OF THIS FAIR LAND HERE SENT ME OVER TO RUSSIA AS AN AMBASSADOR TO THIS NATION, TO RUSSIA, IF THEY WERE OFFICIALLY sent me to Russia, ALL THE POWER THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS IS BEHIND ME. &gt;&gt; MY WORD IS JUST THE SAME AS AS THE UNITED STATES. IF I HAVE BEEN recognized as an ambassador, THEN IF GOD HAS SENT US TO BE HIS AMBASSADORS, &gt;&gt; ALL THE POWER THAT'S IN HEAVEN, &gt;&gt; ALL THAT GOD IS, &gt;&gt; ALL OF HIS ANGELS, ALL OF HIS POWER STANDS BEHIND OUR WORDS, IF WE'RE CORRECTLY ORDAINED, SENT MESSENGERS TO THE PEOPLE, GOD HAS TO HONOR HIS WORDS FOR HE HAS SOLEMNLY WRITTEN, "WHATSOEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH, THAT I'LL BIND IN HEAVEN." &gt;&gt; AND I'LL GIVE UNTO THEE THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "SIX GREAT PROMISES." HE HAS GIVEN TO THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; This may sound redundant, but I WANT TO GO AGAIN. HE SAID JOSHUA STOPPED THE SUN. IS THAT TRUE? &gt;&gt; Some people says, "Oh, he says, SOMEBODY SAID, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE WITH GOD. NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE, BUT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE TO YOU ALSO. HE SAID, "NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THEM THAT BELIEVE." ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE BROUGHT RIGHT DOWN AND MADE TO YOU IF YOU JUST KNOW WHO GOD IS. HE SAID, "I'M AFRAID THAT THE CHURCH DOESN'T KNOW THEIR AUTHORITY. I'M AFRAID HOLY GHOST MEN, BORN MEN, DOESN'T REALIZE THEIR AUTHORITY OR THE AUTHORITY THAT GOD HAS PERMITTED TO HIS CHURCH. I'LL GIVE UNTO THEE THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM. WHATEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH WILL BE BOUND IN HEAVEN. WHATEVER YOU LOOSE ON EARTH WILL BE LOOSED IN HEAVEN. I GIVE YOU POWER OVER SERPENTS AND OVER ALL KINDS OF DISEASES &gt;&gt; AND NOTHING SHALL HARM YOU. &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. EXERCISE YOUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID LET GOD HAVE HIS WAY. HE SAYS IN WISDOM VERSUS FAITH. I'M SORRY TO BE READING so much, but you can forgive me if you will. HE SAID, "THEN IF JESUS DEFEATED SATAN UPON THE FAITH, KNOWING WHO HE WAS, &gt;&gt; HE WAS A PREDESTINATED CREATURE." HE SAID, "ARE you ready?" HE SAID, "WHAT ABOUT A PREDESTINATED BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST RIGHT NOW?" &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; OH, BUT WE CAN RECOGNIZE WHO JESUS IS. That's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; Well, don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, watch what he does. I just want to go to some place here. Wasn't quite ready to go there, but I want to go there. WHEN JOHN SAW HIM IN REVELATION chapter one, he said, "I FELL AT HIS FEET AS DEAD." &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO JUST READ YOU A COUPLE OF titles of what OUR LORD JESUS TITLES THAT BELONG TO HIM. He was the advocate, &gt;&gt; THE ALMIGHTY, &gt;&gt; THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE AMEN OF REVELATIONS 3, the angel of HIS PRESENCE, THE ANOINTED ONE, THE APOSTLE, THE ARM OF THE LORD, the author and the finisher of our faith, the beginning, the end OF THE CREATION OF GOD. HE WAS THE BELOVED. HE WAS THE BLESSED ONE. HE WAS THE BREAD OF LIFE. HE IS OUR BRIDEGROOM. HE IS THE BRIDE AND THE MORNING STAR. HE IS THE CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S HOST. HE IS THE CAPTAIN OF OUR SALVATION. HE IS THE CHIEF SHEPHERD. HE IS THE CHIEFEST AMONG 10 THOUSANDS. HE IS THE CHOSEN OF GOD. HE IS CHRIST, THE ANOINTED ONE. HE IS OUR LORD. HE IS THE WISDOM OF GOD. HE IS THE BLESSED ONE. HE IS THE COMMANDER. HE IS THE COUNSELOR. HE IS THE COVENANT OF THE PEOPLE. HE IS THE DAY STAR. HE IS THE DESIRE OF ALL NATION. HE'S THE DOOR WITHIN THE DOOR. &gt;&gt; HE IS EMMANUEL. HE IS THE INSIDE. HE IS THE ETERNAL LIFE. HE'S THE EVERLASTING FATHER. HE'S THE FAITHFUL AND THE TRUE WITNESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He is THE AUTHOR AND THE FINISHER OF OUR FAITH. AGAIN, HE SAID HE'S FOR THE FIRST BEGOTTEN. HE'S THE FOUNDATION. HE'S THE FORERUNNER. HE'S THE FRIEND OF SINNERS. HE IS THE GIFT OF GOD. HE'S THE BLESSED ONE. &gt;&gt; HE'S THE GOD OF THE WHOLE EARTH. HE IS THE GOVERNOR. HE IS THE MASTER. HE IS THE GREAT SHEPHERD OF THE SHEEP. HE'S THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH. HE'S THE HEIR OF ALL THINGS. HE IS OUR HIGH PRIEST. HE IS THE HEAD OF EVERY MAN. HE'S THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH. HE'S THE HEAD OF THE CORNER. HE'S THE HOLY CHILD, JESUS. HE IS THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL. HE'S THE HOLY ONE OF GOD. HE IS THAT HOLY THING. HE IS THE HOPE. HE IS THE HORN OF OUR SALVATION. HE IS THE IMAGE OF GOD. HE IS ISRAEL. HE IS THE I AM THAT I AM. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO STOP RIGHT THERE. ONE TITLE. &gt;&gt; CAN I STOP WITH JUST ONE TITLE HERE JUST FOR A MOMENT? &gt;&gt; ONE TITLE. WHEN WHEN MOSES, THE PROPHET OF GOD, WAS STANDING BEFORE THAT BURNING BUSH, &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "TELL ME WHO YOU ARE." HE SAID, "JUST TELL THEM THAT I AM THAT I AM &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST NATION ON THE WHOLE EARTH, THE GREATEST WISDOM, THE GREATEST MILITARY POWER FELL TO THE TITLE OF I AM THAT I AM. Let me just SAY THIS TO YOU. JESUS CHRIST WILL NEVER BE JUST ONE OF THE BOYS. HEBREWS CHAPTER 1. GOD WHO AT SUNDER TIMES AND IN DIVERSE MANNER SPAKE IN TIMES PAST unto the prophets uh h and TIMES PAST UNTO THE FATHERS BY THE PROPHETS HATH IN THESE LAST DAYS SPOKEN TO US BY HIS SON whom hath appointed heir of ALL THINGS BY WHOM ALSO HE MADE THE WORLDS WHO BE THE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS GLORY AND THE EXPRESS IMAGE OF HIS PERSON UPHOLDING ALL THINGS BY THE WORD of his power WHEN HE HAD BY HIMSELF SELF PURGED OUR SINS, SAT down at the right hand of THE MAJESTY ON HIGH, BEING MADE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ANGELS, AS HE HATH BY AN INHERITANCE OBTAINED A MORE EXCELLENT NAME THAN THEY. &gt;&gt; For unto WHICH THE ANGEL SAID, HE AT ANY TIME THOU ART MY SON, THIS DAY HAVE I BEGOTTEN THEE, AND AGAIN I WILL BE TO HIM A FATHER, AND HE SHALL BE TO ME A SON. AND AGAIN, WHEN HE BRINGETH THE FIRST BEGOTTEN INTO THE WORLD, HE SAID, "AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM." AND OF ALL THE ANGELS, HE SAID, "WHO MAKETH HIS ANGEL SPIRITS AND HIS MINISTERS A FLAME OF FIRE?" BUT UNTO THE SON, HE SAID, "THY THRONE, OH GOD, IS FOREVER AND EVER A SCEPTER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. IT IS A SCEPTER OF THY KINGDOM. THOU HAST LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED INIQUITY. THEREFORE, GOD, EVEN THY GOD, HATH ANOINTED THEE WITH THE ALL OF GLADNESS ABOVE THY FELLOWS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Ron, many didn't recognize who Jesus was." TRUE. MANY DON'T RECOGNIZE WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; People wait on you in restaurants. They work on you in hospitals. &gt;&gt; You work with them shouldertosh shoulder, &gt;&gt; arm to arm. &gt;&gt; And once in a while, YOU BEGIN TO TELL THEM ABOUT SOMETHING THAT LAYS JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE OF YOUR SKIN. &gt;&gt; YOU BEGIN TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE HOPE OF YOUR SALVATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU BEGIN TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE BRIGHT AND THE MORNING STAR. YOU BEGIN TO TELL THE WORLD ABOUT A JESUS THAT IS MORE THAN ONE OF 2,000 YEARS AGO. &gt;&gt; YOU BEGIN TO TELL THEM ONE THAT HE IS MY PERSONAL GOD. HE IS THE ONE THAT LIVES IN MY HEART. HE IS THE BREATH. HE IS THE HEARTBEAT THAT IS INSIDE OF ME. &gt;&gt; AND NOT ONLY ME AS MY I AM HIS SON, BUT ALSO I AM HIS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, you say, "BROTHER RON, THAT'S SO HARD TO CONVINCE." IT WAS FOR JESUS AS WELL. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO JUST DROP A COUPLE OF THINGS right here. &gt;&gt; There was a WOMAN THAT HAD A PROBLEM &gt;&gt; AND SHE HAD A NEED. &gt;&gt; SHE HAD WENT TO THE WELL MANY TIMES WITH HER NEED. NOW, SHE NEEDED THE COVENANT. &gt;&gt; SHE NEEDED THE CAPTAIN OF A SALVATION. &gt;&gt; SHE NEEDED A GREAT HIGH PRIEST. &gt;&gt; SHE NEEDED ONE THAT COULD NOT ONLY BE A PREACHER TO HER, BUT HE COULD DELIVER HER &gt;&gt; and reach down into the UTTERMOST AND CHANGE THE VERY VILEENESS OF HER LIFE. SHE HAD WALKED BY MANY PREACHERS AND THEY FAILED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THAT UNTO HER. &gt;&gt; SHE HAD HEARD OF THERE WAS A MESSIAH THAT WAS COMING. BUT ONE DAY SITTING AT THE WELL, &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A MAN &gt;&gt; WHO HAD ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD DWELLING WITHIN HIM. &gt;&gt; A MAN WITH A BEARD. A MAN THAT WAS WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY UNRECOGNIZABLE TO THE POPULAR WHO'S WHO. &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT RECOGNIZED WITH ANY CARDS OF ANY DENOMINATIONAL CHARACTERS. &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT A PART OF THE SANHEDRIN COUNCIL. THAT THIS HIGH PRIEST, &gt;&gt; this Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; AS HE WAS SITTING THERE, AS HE WAS STANDING THERE THAT DAY, LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU, WOULD NOT LEAVE HER THE SAME WAY THAT SHE WALKED IN. &gt;&gt; I TRUST THAT THIS CAMP HAS TOUCHED MANY OF YOUR HEARTS. And I WANT YOU TO REALIZE IT'S NOT THE PERSONALITY OF MEN, &gt;&gt; but it's THE PRESENCE OF GOD THAT CHANGES our lives. MEN GO ABOUT THEIR BUSY LIVES DOING THIS AND DOING MISSION WORK, GOING BACK TO THEIR CHURCHES AND DOING THAT. BUT THE GOD THAT HAS CHANGED YOUR LIFE, HE'LL GO HOME WITH YOU. HE'LL LIVE WITH YOU. HE'LL ABIDE WITH YOU. HE WILL KEEP YOU. He began to speak to her about her weakness. &gt;&gt; She, like probably a couple of you, had some weaknesses. Her weakness was keeping her from going deeper. And when her weaknesses were revealed, he told HER ABOUT A WATER THAT SHE WOULD NEVER THIRST AGAIN. &gt;&gt; This woman when SHE LEFT THE WELL THAT DAY WAS NEVER NEVER NEVER THE SAME. &gt;&gt; IF YOU CAN TRULY MEET him &gt;&gt; in a in a way TO WHERE THAT HE COMES IN THAT SOLEMN PRESENCE. Oh yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU CATCH MORE THAN JUST ELOHAZER'S VOICE? &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU CATCH MORE THAN JUST THE PASTOR'S VOICE? &gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU CATCH MORE THAN JUST THE THE THE INSPIRATION OF THE SONG LEADER? &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CATCH THAT ANOINTING OF THAT PERSONAGE OF THE EXPRESS PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST REVEALED TO YOU. &gt;&gt; LET HIM COME TO YOUR PEW. LET HIM COME TO YOUR HOME. LET HIM CHANGE YOUR LIFE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, THIS MESSAGE IS ALL ABOUT BROTHER BRANDHAM. You're missing it. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. PREACH." &gt;&gt; THE ATTACHMENT OF THE HONEY IS WHAT CAUGHT SOME OF OUR OUR THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; THE WAY HE WORE HIS BLUE JEAN SHIRT CAUGHT SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS. THE WAY HE SPOKE HIS LANGUAGE CAUGHT SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS. BUT IT WAS THE BAIT ON THE HOOK. &gt;&gt; THE MIRACLES AND THE SIGNS AND THE WONDERS. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, GOD DEPOSITED A MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; HE REVISITED A COVENANT FOR THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND HE BE WHISPER SECRETS TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HE WANTED TO CALL YOU FROM THE KITCHEN, FROM THE LIVING ROOM, AND TAKE YOU TO THE BEDROOM. HE WANTS YOU TO BE MORE THAN JUST A FLIRTATIOUS GIRLFRIEND. HE WANTS YOU TO BECOME HIS BRIDE. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're sitting HERE IN THE INTRODUCTION STAGE, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY THERE. &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL WIFE THAT IS SITTING OVER HERE. IT WAS MY MOTHER WHO INTRODUCED ME TO her and I went and I met her. I THOUGHT, "WOW, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL." You know, AND BUT YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS I DROVE TWO AND A HALF HOURS TO SEE HER, you know, that was nice. But, YOU KNOW, WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE STORIES. WE COULD TALK ON THE PHONE. YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS THAT'S BEEN THERE. BUT, you know, I wanted more. &gt;&gt; I WANTED MORE. THERE'S A LONGING IN MY HEART, A LONGING IN HER HEART. And we begin TO ENTER INTO A covenant &gt;&gt; of engagement. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; WE ENTERED INTO A COVENANT OF ENGAGEMENT. NOW THERE'S NO MORE GIRLS AND NO MORE BOYS. &gt;&gt; MAYBE FOUR BILLION PEOPLE IN THE EARTH, BUT THERE'S ONE VOICE THAT I WANT TO HEAR ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONE PERSON I WANT TO HEAR SAY, "GOOD NIGHT, HONEY. I LOVE YOU." THERE'S ONE PERSON THAT I WANT TO BE MY BEST FRIEND OF MY WHOLE LIFE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WE STEPPED OUT OF ETERNITY INTO A SPACE OF TIME AND WE'LL SHARE THIS LIFE TOGETHER. ONE DAY WE'LL STEP BACK INTO ETERNITY AGAIN. &gt;&gt; BUT WE MUST TAKE STEPS GOING FORWARD. IT'S MORE THAN A PICTURE ON THE WALL. IT'S MORE THAN JUST WORDS BEING EXCHANGED. BUT ONE DAY THERE'S AN THERE IS A RING THAT IS EXCHANGED. THERE'S VOWS THAT IS EXCHANGED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS YOU TO ENTER INTO THAT COVENANT &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS YOU'RE JUST FLIRTING WITH IT. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AS LONG AS YOU'RE JUST FLIRTING WITH IT &gt;&gt; FOR THE BENEFITS that you get. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Many people sit around just for the benefits. &gt;&gt; I pay my tithes for the benefits. AND THERE ARE BENEFITS. &gt;&gt; I GIVE OFFERINGS FOR THE BENEFITS. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THERE'S A BENEFIT THAT COMES WITH THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY JUST SIT HERE FOR THE BENEFITS WHEN you can have the whole package. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO MANY PEOPLE ROB THEMSELVES ONLY SITTING MAYBE A STEP AWAY FROM TRULY SURRENDERING THEIR LIVES &gt;&gt; AND ENTERING INTO THE COVENANT WHERE THE I AM &gt;&gt; WHERE OUR HEAVENLY BRIDEGROOM ENTERS INTO THE BRIDE CHAMBER OF OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE REMEMBER EVERY TITLE THAT BELONGS TO him Amen. &gt;&gt; Belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Don't swallow your tongue. You'll be okay. &gt;&gt; Because remember in the breach he WAS A KING. HE STEPPED FORTH FROM THE THRONE. HE STEPPED FORTH AND HE SAID THROUGHOUT THE THE THE CHURCH AGES HE HAD BEEN THE HIGH PRIEST. BUT HE STEPS FORTH IN THIS AGE AND BECOMES KING. AND HE'S LOOKING FOR HIS QUEEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID HE HAS TO HAVE SUBJECTS. &gt;&gt; I'm one. &gt;&gt; Oh, we got a couple more here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THE WOMAN FROM MEMPHIS WAS LOOKING FOR ONE OF THOSE SUBJECTS. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS CARRYING SOME MAIL BECAUSE HIS PLANE HAD BEEN GROUNDED. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING DOWN THROUGH THERE SINGING THE SONG, I'M ONE of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Just keep walking. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, HANEY. GOOD MORNING, PARSON. HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS A PARSONATE? &gt;&gt; I WAS PRAYING &gt;&gt; I'LL BE LIKE THAT SUDOMITE WOMAN. &gt;&gt; SHE IDENTIFIED HERSELF IN THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; SHE HAD NOT HEARD THE SEALS. SHE HAD NOT HEARD SHALOM BECAUSE THEY HADN'T BEEN PREACHED YET. SHE HAD NOT HEARD THOSE MESSAGES. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW SHE KNEW THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK. YOU'RE SITTING here and you may be a new Christian. YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL." AS LONG AS YOU IDENTIFY WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK, &gt;&gt; HE WILL BEGIN TO PULL ON YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; HE WILL BEGIN TO SHOW YOU FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER DAY TO ANOTHER DAY. ARE YOU WITH ME, &gt;&gt; BROTHER? I'VE BEEN HERE 5 YEARS. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL. GOD WILL THROUGHOUT THE ETERNITIES EVER BE UNFOLDING HIS MYSTERIES TO YOU AND I. WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM WALKED INTO HER ROOM, I just want to leave this is free of charge. When Brother Brandham walked into her home, Brother Brandham ask her to pray. He didn't walk into that home and said, "I'm here. &gt;&gt; You called for Elijah. I'm here. I'm fulfilling your scripture. I'm here." He said HE WALKED IN THERE AND RECOGNIZED THE PRESENCE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Saw the pictures on the wall. SAW DEATH ON THAT BOY. &gt;&gt; NOTICE WHAT HE SAYS. AIN'T HE? WON'T YOU PRAY? &gt;&gt; OH, that's good. &gt;&gt; Forgive me, but I'm just going to say it. &gt;&gt; Probably too ignorant to not say it. Many TV EVANGELISTS WOULD SAY, "I'M HERE." &gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S GOOD. PREACH IT. &gt;&gt; I'm here. I'M ON THE SCENE. BUT THAT PROPHET OF GOD WAS AWARE THAT THE I AM THAT I AM &gt;&gt; WAS ALREADY THERE. &gt;&gt; AND GOD WAS GOING TO CONFIRM HIS WORD TO THIS LITTLE LADY. &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD WOULD DO THAT FOR HER, HOW MUCH MORE FOR YOU? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He said, "I am so glad I WANT TO READ SOME THINGS ABOUT YOU. I'M SO GLAD THAT A MAN CAN SO COMPLETELY SERVE GOD TILL THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM." JESUS CHRIST. NO MATTER IF HE WAS IN A STORM, THE GALE WAS KNOCKING THE BOAT FROM ONE SIDE TO ANOTHER, OR HE WAS STANDING IN THE FACE OF A MESS OF DEMONS, if he was hanging anywhere, he never, it never moved him. HE WALKED RIGHT ALONG JUST AS CALM AND QUIET AS HE COULD BE. WHY? HE WAS SIMPLY unconscious of fear. Anything around him, WHETHER IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, WHETHER IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN, HE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE GOD SAID IT WOULD. HE SAID, "OH, WONDER IF I PRAYED THROUGH. I WONDERED IF I FASTED LONG ENOUGH. I WONDER IF I DID THIS." HE JUST WALKED RIGHT ON UNCONSCIOUS. HE BELIEVED WHAT GOD SAID WAS THE TRUTH. THE WORDS MUST BE FULFILLED. AND HE KNOWED WHAT HIS LIFE WAS TO FULFILL THEM. AND THAT WAS RIGHT. HE WAS PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FAITH THAT HE HAD. HE JUST SPOKE IT AND KNEW IT WOULD BE SO. &gt;&gt; He said, "WE HEAR SO MANY PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, IF I ONLY HAD FAITH." &gt;&gt; FAITH ISN'T IT DOESN'T MEAN DOWN DRAWN OUT LONG PRAYER MEETINGS. IT DOESN'T MEAN LONG FA FAST. HE SAID FAITH IS AN UNCONSCIOUS THING. &gt;&gt; YOUR REAL FAITH. You're unconscious of it. &gt;&gt; JESUS SAYS YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THE FAITH THAT YOU HAVE GOT, IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS MATTER WITH YOU. COULD YOU IMAGINE JESUS QUESTIONING WHETHER HE HAD FAITH OR NOT TO STOP THE WINDS OR STOP THE WAVES OR HAVE FAITH ENOUGH TO RAISE LAZARUS UP? HE NEVER QUESTIONED HIS OWN FAITH. &gt;&gt; JESUS DIDN'T HAVE TO GO OUT AND FAST ALL DAY AND PRAY ALL DAY and he THEN SAY, "NOW I WONDER IF I'VE GOT ENOUGH FAITH TO DO THIS." HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FAITH THAT HE HAD. ANY men or women that ever make a REAL WARRIORS IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THEIR FAITH. YOU KEEP TRYING TO TEST YOUR FAITH. WONDER IF I'VE GOT FAITH ENOUGH TO DO THIS. HAVE I GOT FAITH? HE SAYS DON'T TEST YOUR FAITH. GOD SAID SO. DO IT ANYHOW. &gt;&gt; HE SAID FAITH KNOWS NO DEFEAT. &gt;&gt; FAITH IS PERFECT. FAITH BRINGS HE SAYS FAITH BRINGS THINGS WHEN THERE IS NO THINGS TO BE BROUGHT. FAITH CREATES. FAITH TAKES DOUBT AWAY. IT TAKES NEGATIVE AND MAKES POSITIVE. THE OLD MAN HAD A BASIS FOR FAITH. FAITH IS NOT MYTHICAL, SOMETHING MENTALLY WORKED UP. IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE FUNDAMENTAL RESULT OF WHAT HAPPENS IN A PERSON'S HEART. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother Ron, I I'd like for you to just share an experience with me on that." Okay, LET ME JUST TAKE YOU BACK TO THE COVENANT. THERE WAS A MAN THAT KEPT HAVING DEMONS COME TO HIS HOUSE EVERY YEAR. HE WOULD PLANT HIS HE WOULD PLANT HIS FIELDS. HE WOULD HARVEST HIS FIELDS. AND JUST AS HE HARVESTES HIS FIELDS, &gt;&gt; THEY WOULD SEND THE PHILISTINE ARMY DOWN there &gt;&gt; and they would take everything that he HAD, BUT LEAVE HIM JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP HIM IN CHURCH FOR THE NEXT YEAR. &gt;&gt; THEY'D LEAVE HIM JUST ENOUGH SAVED AND JUST ENOUGH TO LET HIM EAT FOR THE NEXT YEAR. NOW, YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS HE DIDN'T IDENTIFY WITH THE COVENANT, &gt;&gt; THAT PHILISTINE ARMY HAD NO PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; WELL, BOYS, IT'S TIME TO GO MAKE A RAID. LET'S GO OVER TO SHAMGAR'S house &gt;&gt; and LET'S TAKE HIS STUFF. LET'S JUST LITERALLY RAVISH HIM. YEAH. &gt;&gt; And they DID IT YEAR AFTER year after year after YEAR AFTER YEAR. BUT ONE DAY, &gt;&gt; ONE DAY HE RECOGNIZED A part &gt;&gt; of the covenant &gt;&gt; and MAYBE HE RUN ACROSS THE SCRIPTURE. Forgive me for my folly. BUT MAYBE HE RUN ACROSS THIS SCRIPTURE AND IT SAID, "ONE MAN &gt;&gt; SHALL CHASE A THOUSAND." &gt;&gt; ONE MAN SHALL CHASE A THOUSAND. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE 45,000 PHONE CALLS TO HELP ME. HE SAID, "ONE MAN SHALL CHASE A THOUSAND." &gt;&gt; Forgive me. &gt;&gt; MAYBE HE GOT THE COUNTING HIS ENEMY. HEY, THEY ONLY BROUGHT 600. &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T BRING ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; They got the trumpeting up through there EVERY YEAR. SAME DEAL. SAME DEAL. SAME DEAL. SAME DEAL. BUT THIS TIME HE COUNTED THEM. AND THEY WERE 401 SHORT. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE 401 SHORT. THE COVENANT SAID, "I CAN HAVE A THOUSAND OF THEM." &gt;&gt; AND HE JUMPED OUT THE WINDOW &gt;&gt; AND HE GRABBED A SIX-FOOT STICK. &gt;&gt; OH, brother Ron, I'D HAVE BEEN AFRAID. LISTEN, HE KNEW IT WAS NOT HIM THAT WAS KNOWING BECAUSE GOD SAID, "I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I WILL DO THE FIGHTING. I WILL DRIVE THEM OUT. I WILL DO THE WORK. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S HIM THAT IS IN YOU." Brother Ron, I'm afraid that WHEN I LEAVE THIS CAMP AND I GO BACK IN THREE weeks that here I'll COME. I'LL HEAR THEM HOOF BEATS AGAIN. &gt;&gt; I'LL HEAR THE BEAT OF THAT ROCK AND ROLL. &gt;&gt; I'LL FEEL THAT COOL LUKEWARM SPIRIT OF LEOSIA CREEPING BACK INTO MY HOME AGAIN. &gt;&gt; I'LL GO BACK TO THE THINGS THAT I USED TO BE ENTERTAINED BY. YOU KEEP FEEDING THIS EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; Oprah Winfrey DOES NOT HAVE RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; SPORTS DOES NOT HAVE RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; TELEVISION DOES NOT HAVE RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; Come on church, LET ME PREACH. BENNY HYMN DOES NOT HAVE RAPTURING FAITH. THE DENOMINATIONS DO NOT HAVE RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; THIS WORD HAS RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; OH, brother Ron, I LIKE THEIR REASONING. THEY SAY SOME GOOD THINGS ABOUT FAMILY THINGS. SO DOES BROTHER BRANDHAM. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF THEIR MATERIAL FROM BROTHER BRHAM. AND WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GET IT FROM A MIXED TREE TO START OFF WITH &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU CAN HAVE IT RIGHT STRAIGHT &gt;&gt; FROM THE AUTHOR and the finish of our faith. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE STRONG. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE THE BRIDE. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO OVERCOME. NOTICE THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE DOOR AND KNOCK." IT DOESN'T SAY TO THEM. IT SAYS TO HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; TO THAT ONE THAT OVERCOMETH. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT BE the only one in your family. &gt;&gt; Grab your stick. &gt;&gt; GRAB YOUR STICK. &gt;&gt; GO TO WORK. &gt;&gt; Hold my brother on. I hear the footprints. I HEAR THE STOMPING OF THAT OF THAT HORSE COMING DOWN THROUGH THERE. JUST START QUOTING SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; IT HAS ATOMIC power to it. &gt;&gt; GREATER IS HE &gt;&gt; THAT IS IN ME &gt;&gt; THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Faith muscle starts swelling. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't have many, so you just have to bear with me. &gt;&gt; If ye abide in me AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN YOU, ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND IT SHALL BE DONE UNTO YOU. AND YOU FEEL ANOTHER BUMP OF FAITH. &gt;&gt; THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU &gt;&gt; AND YOU FEEL YOUR FAITH MUSCLE START POPPING UP. &gt;&gt; HEY, LISTEN. IT'S AN UNFAIR FIGHT. THEY DIDN'T BRING ENOUGH DEVILS. &gt;&gt; When a man lives BY FAITH AND WALKS BY FAITH, HE'S A SUBSTANCE OF FAITH. HE IS ISOLATED FROM THE ENTIRE world and becomes a new creature in Christ. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS NOW HE SAYS THERE NOW YOU'RE GETTING INTO BRIDE MATERIAL. YOU'RE GETTING INTO RAPTURING CONDITION. &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS FOR EACH ONE OF US, NOT JUST FOR THE PASTOR, FOR THE DEACON, FOR THE TRUSTEE. THAT MEANS FOR THE LEY, EVERY INDIVIDUAL WALKS IN A WORLD WITH GOD ALONE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BAPTIZED INTO THE KINGDOM. HE SAID THERE IS NOBODY IN THERE BUT YOU AND GOD. HE GIVES THE ORDERS, YOU CARRY THEM OUT. &gt;&gt; Now join a man joins the military. You know, maybe he had a chief petty officer that told him, he said, "You might want to bring your golf clubs when you go to boot camp. you might want to take your tennis racket. &gt;&gt; SO HE GETS OFF OF THE BUS WITH ALL OF THIS STUFF ON HIS BACK. &gt;&gt; HE'S THINKING HE'S GOING TO CALL HIS MAMA 14 TIMES A DAY. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A MAN THAT'S STANDING THERE IN FRONT OF HIM SAYS, "I'M YOUR MAMA. I'm your daddy. &gt;&gt; I'M YOUR UNCLE. I'M YOUR AUNT. I'M YOUR COUSIN, MAYBEL. &gt;&gt; I'LL GET YOU UP. I'LL PUT YOU TO SLEEP. &gt;&gt; I'LL DO YOUR THINKING FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S GOING TO MAKE A SOLDIER OUT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND MAYBE THERE'S 10,000 OF THEM ALL IN THE SAME SECTION. &gt;&gt; AND THEY START WALKING ACROSS THE BRIDGE. YOU OUGHT TO HEAR WHAT A THUNDER THEY ARE. ALL OF THEM OUT OF ORDER. &gt;&gt; But give him a few weeks. &gt;&gt; HE'LL BRING THINGS OUT OF THEM THEY NEVER THOUGHT WAS IN THERE. &gt;&gt; THEY WILL NOT ONLY WALK FIVE MILES, THEY'LL RUN FIVE MILES. &gt;&gt; And there's something in THEM THAT KNOWS THEY'RE GETTING READY FOR WAR AND THEY'LL SAY, "I LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE. THEY'LL CHARGE THE HILL. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE READY. THAT THAT JUST THAT SERGEANT'S VOICE. THEY'RE TUNED TO THE VOICE OF THAT SERGEANT &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE LISTENING FOR THE COMMAND AND THEY'RE GETTING READY. THEY'RE GETTING READY. THERE'S SOMETHING THEY'RE GETTING READY FOR. &gt;&gt; NOW THAT GOVERNMENT, HE GIVES THEM THE BEST CLOTHING THAT THEY CAN HAVE FOR MILITARY. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SOME DISCLAIMER THERE. &gt;&gt; THEN HE GIVES THEM THE best armor that he can give them. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, GOD DOES IT MUCH THE SAME WAY. &gt;&gt; HE SENDS US THROUGH BOOT CAMP. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE WALK RIGHT OUT OF DENOMINATIONALISM AND we looked a Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; WE WALK RIGHT OUT OF THE WORLD and maybe you was looking over at that guy and say, "He'll never stick. &gt;&gt; I give him six weeks. &gt;&gt; Hair down to his shoulders. pierced ears, &gt;&gt; tattoos, &gt;&gt; terrible life. &gt;&gt; And God starts taking that bulldozer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE STARTS TAKING THE WATER OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; And he starts cleaning up habits. He starts sanctifying. &gt;&gt; He starts purifying. &gt;&gt; He's not GOING TO JUST LEAVE YOU IN THAT CONDITION. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A BATTLE THAT YOU'VE GOT. &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU'RE NOT CALL TO A PICNIC. &gt;&gt; A REAL SOLDIER DON'T PACK COOKIES. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT GOING TO SIT AROUND PLAY CARDS ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS HE'S GOT TO GET READY FOR A BATTLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IF THAT SERGEANT IS A GOOD SERGEANT, HE'S GOING TO TRAIN IT WHEN YOU GET IN A BIND AND YOU'RE BY YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE DROP YOU BEHIND ENEMY LINES, WHICH WE WILL, &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, YOU'RE A WARRIOR. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, THAT SEEMS VICIOUS. GOD PRE-PLANNED YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; He picked you out of A MILLION. &gt;&gt; OH, THANK YOU, JESUS. &gt;&gt; HE BYPASSED A MILLION. &gt;&gt; TO TALK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, THERE WERE PEOPLE WITH BETTER EDUCATION. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS PEOPLE WITH MORE MONEY. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS PEOPLE THAT LOOK BETTER THAN YOU DID. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU. THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT HE IDENTIFIED WITH. IT WAS A PART OF HIS OWN SIN. &gt;&gt; He's looking through all the ages. &gt;&gt; So he picks his best for this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; CUZ HE DON'T NEED SURVIVORS OF LEOA. &gt;&gt; HE DON'T NEED PEOPLE THAT JUST GET BY. &gt;&gt; HE NEEDS PEOPLE THAT are overcomers. &gt;&gt; I'd like to put IT LIKE THIS. HE NEEDS SOME CHAMPIONS. OF &gt;&gt; LEOTA. &gt;&gt; HE NEEDS SOME MEN AND WOMEN &gt;&gt; THAT HE CAN DROP INTO THE DARKEST AGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND ONE DAY DISCOVER &gt;&gt; THAT ABOUT THEMSELVES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, IT'S ONE THING FOR MOSES, HIS MOTHER, TO TELL HIM OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, YOU ARE THE DELIVERER, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING FOR YOU TO HEAR IT FROM YOUR MAS AND YOUR DADDIES, AND YOU HEAR IT FROM THE PROPHET, AND THEN ONE DAY YOU REALIZE, &gt;&gt; YEAH, &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN CALLED FOR. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN CALLED FOR. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN ANOINTED FOR. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN PREDESTINATED FOR. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD TO THEM THAT LOVE GOD, &gt;&gt; TO THEM WHO ARE THE CALLED &gt;&gt; ACCORDING to his purpose. FOR WHOM HE DID FORNO, &gt;&gt; HE DID ALSO PREDESTINATE &gt;&gt; TO BE CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF HIS SON, THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRSTBORN AMONG MANY BRETHREN. &gt;&gt; MOREOVER, WHOM HE DID PREDESTINATE, &gt;&gt; THEM HE ALSO CALLED. &gt;&gt; AND WHOM HE CALLED, HE ALSO JUSTIFIED. &gt;&gt; AND WHOM HE JUSTIFIED, THEM HE ALSO GLORIFIED. SO, NOT ONLY DID HE CALL YOU TO THIS DAY, &gt;&gt; HE HAS ALREADY JUSTIFIED YOU. &gt;&gt; AND IT IS AS THOUGH YOU NEVER SINNED IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; And you realize it wasn't even you to start off with. &gt;&gt; A friend of mine showed up here a while back and he sat down with me for lunch. an old friend from many many years ago back when I had locks down on my shoulders. And he sat down and we we just talked and I thought I'll just let him talk for a few minutes. We sat at McDonald's and I had coffee. I didn't figure we would have much time for lunch. And so simply put, he began to talk about the old times. I figured he would because that's the one that he knew. &gt;&gt; I looked over at him and I said, "Uh, I need to tell you something." He said, "Oh." I said, "Yeah." I said, "YOU KNOW THAT GUY THAT YOU KNEW THAT USED TO LIVE HERE? &gt;&gt; He's dead. THAT GUY'S DEAD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE GOT BURIED. &gt;&gt; THE OLD MAN, &gt;&gt; HE'S GONE. &gt;&gt; THIS MIGHT RESEMBLE THE ORIGINAL HOUSE. &gt;&gt; BUT THE ORIGINAL NATURE &gt;&gt; THAT WAS MY FIRST HUSBAND, &gt;&gt; HE IS DEAD. HE DON'T LIVE HERE IN NO MORE HOME. &gt;&gt; NOW, THE GUY THAT YOU KNEW DID DO THOSE THINGS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I WAS UNDER THAT INFLUENCE, BUT THAT GUY IS GONE FOREVER. &gt;&gt; NOW, WHEN GOD SEEN YOU, HE HE CALLED YOU. HE KNEW WHAT AGE THAT YOU WOULD COME TO. AND HE JUSTIFIED you &gt;&gt; even before you arrived. &gt;&gt; HE GLORIFIED YOU EVEN BEFORE YOU ARRIVED. &gt;&gt; SO IN GOD'S MIND, &gt;&gt; we are already there. &gt;&gt; WE ARE ALREADY OVERCOMERS. I NEED AN EXAMPLE. GOOD. JOB WAS SITTING THERE CONCERNED WITH SOME THINGS. &gt;&gt; AND GOD ASKED JOB, "WHERE WAS YOU AT, JOB, &gt;&gt; WHEN I LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH?" &gt;&gt; WHEN THE SONS OF THE MORNING SHOUTED TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. WHERE WAS YOU AT? &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RHONDA, BUT I'M IN SUCH A STRUGGLE." YES, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE IN SUCH A TRIAL. YES, BUT COUNT IT GOLD. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE MOLDING. IT'S THE PROCESS. &gt;&gt; SAY, "Brother Ron, I wish somebody else was in the process with me." &gt;&gt; My wife and I had three children. All three children I went to with her to the hospital. You know, it's amazing thing about men when they're having children, they say, "WE'RE HAVING A BABY." &gt;&gt; There is no we to this deal. She's having a baby. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S A PROCESS THAT SHE GOES THROUGH. CAN I JUST Can I just give you this? &gt;&gt; She goes to the doctor and the doctor looks at her and he says, "Congratulations. You're going to have a child." &gt;&gt; She don't hear nothing else. We're going to have a baby. We're going to have a baby. &gt;&gt; Then he proceeds to tell her, "This is your first. So, let me give you a little warning. &gt;&gt; You're going to be kind of uncomfortable in this process. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING LOOKS GLORIOUS, &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME DISCOMFORT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR GIRLISH FIGURE. Your face is going to puff. &gt;&gt; This is going to puff. This is going to puff. Your feet are going to swell. &gt;&gt; You're going to be uncomfortable in the night. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SLEEP ALL NIGHT LONG. THERE'S GOING TO BE CRAVINGS THAT YOU WANT. YOU'RE GOING TO WANT PICKLES AND PEANUT BUTTER. AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT WATERMELON. AND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT CANTALOUPE in the middle OF THE WINTER. THERE'S GOING TO BE TIMES THAT YOU LITERALLY HATE YOUR HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; I'm not going through this for not. I want you to understand that. Come on. &gt;&gt; AND SHE STARTS THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WELL, IT'S NICE AT FIRST CUZ EVERYBODY SAYS, "CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE HAVING A BABY." &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY PATS YOU ON THE BACK. THE MAN STANDS AROUND. WE'RE HAVING A CHILD. Everybody pats him at the BACK OF THE CHURCH. OH, I'M GLAD YOU'RE FINALLY JOINING the fatherhood club. BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Only unless HE GETS THAT SYMPATHIZING MORNING SICKNESS. &gt;&gt; I was not of much help to my wife because every time she gagged, I gagged. Thank God for two bathrooms. WE WOULD WALK DOWN THE ROAD AND SHE'D WALK DOWN THE ROAD. Thank God we're going to TAKE A COUPLE DOGGIES off after this one. I'm dead meat. &gt;&gt; I didn't LOSE MY FIGURE. I LOST THAT A LONG TIME AGO. SHE WAS WOBBLING. SHE WAS ALMOST LIKE A DUCK FOR A WHILE. IT WAS HOT. I MEAN HOT. Air condition in the winter time. Hot. SHE WAS IN THE PROCESS. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES YOU'RE SITTING IN CHURCH AND YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'M GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY AM I GOING THROUGH THE TROULES? WHY AM I FEELING THESE PAINS? WHY AM I GOING THROUGH THIS?" LISTEN, YOU'RE WITH CHILD. &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO BE IN THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO PUT THE DRESS ON, &gt;&gt; THE WEDDING GOWN, BUT THERE'S A PROCESS THAT WE'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH. THERE'S A MOLDING THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH. &gt;&gt; We went to the hospital. You'll like this, brother DDA. We went to the hospital after 6 hours. I got hungry. Their sister sitting all over this building right now going, "That's just like men. I HAD TO LOOK AT THE MONITOR TO TELL HER SHE WAS HAVING a contraction. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME, SAID, "NOW, YOU CAN WARN HER. AS THIS LITTLE BEAK STARTS GETTING A CERTAIN WAY, you can go ahead and tell her there's a contraction coming. Start breathing a certain way." And I would TELL HER, I WAS DILIGENT. All right, honey. Here comes a contraction. Breathe. Breathe. BREATHE. BREATHE. BREATHE. AFTER 3 HOURS. SHE DON'T NEED A MACHINE &gt;&gt; TO TELL HER THAT SHE'S HAVING A CONTRACTION. &gt;&gt; I do. SHE'S READY FOR ME TO GO TO Mars on a one-way ticket. WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY, "IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL SURVIVE IT. THERE'S TIMES THAT YOU'D LIKE TO JUST LOOK AT THEM AND SAY, "YOU MUST BE FROM MARS SOMEWHERE OR ANOTHER." &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HEAR THE SCRIPTURE, "YAY, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH," AND THAT SCRIPTURE IS BECOMING A LIVING REALITY TO YOU, AND YOU'RE STANDING THERE WITH EVERY DEMON IN HELL AND THE HOST OF HELL. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S AT YOUR BLOCK. IT'S AT YOUR CORNER. IT'S ON YOUR STREET. IT'S RIGHT THERE AT YOUR HOUSE. IT'S ACTING UP IN YOUR CHILDREN. YOU'RE GOING, "THIS IS A CONTRACTION. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A PART OF THE MOLDING PROCESS." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T THINK THIS WOULD HAPPEN TO ME. I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH, BUT NOW IT'S MY TURN. &gt;&gt; It's a process. &gt;&gt; It's a process. SO MANY TIMES WE GET THIS HOLLYWOOD THING OF THE BRIDE. OH, WE BELIEVE A FEW MESSAGES. WE LISTEN TO TAPES. WE COME TO CHURCH. WE'RE BRIDE. I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. THERE'S A PROCESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A PROCESS. GOD DON'T JUST SEND YOU THROUGH A TUBE AND YOU COME OUT ON THE OTHER END, &gt;&gt; BRIDE MATERIAL. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOME REAL TESTS. THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME COLD SOME COLD CLAMMY DEVILS GET A HOLD OF YOUR LIFE AND TRY TO DESTROY YOU. &gt;&gt; YAY. THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, &gt;&gt; I WILL BE WITH THEE. &gt;&gt; When your HUSBAND'S NOT THERE TO HOLD YOUR HAND, WHEN YOUR WIFE IS NOT THERE TO HOLD YOUR HAND, WHEN YOUR DADDY'S NOT THERE TO PREACH YOU THE SERMON, WHEN THE YOUR UNCLES IS NOT AROUND NOWHERE, &gt;&gt; HE'S WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I want to I want to be the bride. He's going to send you through a process. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; You hear the echoes of Brother Brown going through the process. &gt;&gt; Life story. &gt;&gt; You hear him GOING THROUGH IT AND WHY I'M AGAINST DENOMINATIONALISM. &gt;&gt; Serpent seals. &gt;&gt; 10,000 of my friends left me. You hear HIM SAY THE ANGEL REBUKED HIM FOR CERTAIN THINGS. &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR HIM SAY THAT I WAS JUST LIKE AN ORPHAN CHILD. &gt;&gt; GOD, you owe me AN APOLOGY. AND GOD SENDS HIM THROUGH A PROCESS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR HIM? AS THE WORD BEGINS TO UNFOLD TO THE BRIDE, &gt;&gt; HE BEGINS TO TELL US THAT HE WANTED TO BE A TRAPPER. EVEN IN 1962, HE'S STILL PLANNING TO BE A TRAPPER. &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS TO STOP HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MANY TIMES IN OUR PLANS, &gt;&gt; IN OUR AMBITIONS, &gt;&gt; OH, BUT BROTHER RON, WE'RE RIGHT BEFORE THE COMING OF THE LORD. LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS JUST YET. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE STILL GOING TO GO THROUGH SOME PROCESS &gt;&gt; COMING OUT OF A MEETING LIKE THIS OR NEXT WEEK OR TWO YEARS. THERE'S GOING TO BE PROCESSES THAT YOU WILL GO THROUGH. &gt;&gt; WHEN WILL IT STOP, BROTHER? SECONDS BEFORE THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; IS THERE ANYTHING TOO HARD FOR THE LORD? HE SAID SATAN KNEW THAT GOD WAS ON HIS WAY. AND SO SARAH WAS IN A FUSSY MOOD THAT MORNING. &gt;&gt; Probably never happens around your house. That's the best amen laugh I've ever heard in my life. &gt;&gt; Mrs. lot. The caravans go by her way and she gets the best clothes. We're up here on THIS DRY LAND. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH EVEN UH OF GRASS for even the cattle TO HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT. &gt;&gt; DEVIL WAS ANOINTING HER &gt;&gt; AND IN A FEW HOURS GOD HIMSELF &gt;&gt; IS GOING TO COME DOWN AND SPEAK LIFT TO HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU GET READY TO WALK INTO THE SERVICE AND GOD HAS SO ANOINTED THAT MAN RIGHT THERE AS YOUR PASTOR. &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING TO SPEAK LIP TO EAR TO YOU AND YOU GET OUT OF YOUR CAR. &gt;&gt; What is it? Satan's waring with you. &gt;&gt; HE'S WARING WITH YOU. HE'LL CAUSE PEOPLE AT WALMART TO BITE YOUR HEAD OFF. HE'LL CAUSE YOUR BOSS TO BITE YOUR HEAD OFF. HE'LL CAUSE MCDONALD'S TO GIVE YOU A HAIR IN YOUR BISCUIT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE'LL CAUSE YOUR TIRES TO GO FLAT. &gt;&gt; HE'LL CAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE TO GET YOUR MAIL. HE'LL HE'LL SEND A LETTER FROM THE IRS. HE'LL DO WHATEVER HE CAN &gt;&gt; TO DISTRACT YOU. &gt;&gt; CUZ HE KNOWS THAT YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS. &gt;&gt; OH, Brother Ron, I'd like to speak to a mountain. BE THOU REMOVED. GOOD. &gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO SOME SQUIRRELS. GOOD. &gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO A STORM. OKAY. &gt;&gt; GOOD. &gt;&gt; First things first. Place Bible under arm. &gt;&gt; Get keys out of pocket. &gt;&gt; TAKE FAMILY TO CHURCH. FORGIVE ME. WELL, BROTHER RON, BROTHER BRANDON'S MY PASTOR. &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; Well, I met a fellow like that well, not long ago, and he told me that Brother Brand was his pastor. &gt;&gt; So, I looked over and you know, I thought, well, you know, I don't have a long time to preach. I just simply looked at him and said, "When's the LAST TIME YOU LISTENED TO JEZEBEL RELIGION?" &gt;&gt; He said, "It's been a while." I said, "Need to." He said, "Why?" I said, "I'm looking at your wife." &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE COME TO CHURCH AND WE DON'T HEAR WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR. &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; I'm going home in a few hours. Brother Ed will get all this mess straightened out. &gt;&gt; May shoot me, throw me in the river. &gt;&gt; But I want YOU TO KNOW GOD ORDAINS THAT MAN. &gt;&gt; HE WILL DO LIKE WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT. I'LL BE PREACHING AWAY AND ALL THE SUDDEN JUST TURN ME COMPLETELY FOR WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HEADED IN MY OWN MIND. HE WILL TURN ME, STOP THE WHOLE SERVICE IN MY MIND AND START SPEAKING TO YOU &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE HIS CHILDREN AND YOU HAVE NEEDS. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I LOVE TO LISTEN TO TAPES, BUT I DO IT WHEN I'M NOT AT CHURCH. MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY. AND I GO AND SOMETIMES I GET IT BETWEEN SERVICES. &gt;&gt; CUZ THE MORE I FEED MY SOUL, &gt;&gt; the stronger I am. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham met an Indian AND HAD TWO DOGS FIGHTING ON THE INSIDE OF HIM AND HE SAID, "WHICH ONE IS A WINNER?" HE SAID, "THE ONE THAT I FEED THE MOST." THE REASON SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUCH A BATTLE WITH THEIR PROCESS IS THEY'RE NOT FEEDING ON THE BODY WORD OF THE SON OF MAN. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I WANT THE WORD TO SKIN ME ONCE IN A WHILE. &gt;&gt; THE RE SAID WHAT BRANDON TABERNACLE NEEDS IS A KILLING. HE SAID WHAT WILLIAM BRANDON NEEDS IS A KILLING. &gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. Preach me something that'll make me happy. &gt;&gt; That didn't make me happy today. &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, that hurt. &gt;&gt; That hurt. &gt;&gt; That contraction hurts. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good. &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S THE CLOSEST THAT WOMAN WILL EVER COME TO DEATH WITHOUT DYING, &gt;&gt; GIVING BIRTH TO THAT CHILD. SHE WILL ALMOST GIVE HER LIFE TO GIVE BIRTH. THOSE CONTRACTIONS, THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT THAT. IT HURTS. &gt;&gt; It's painful. &gt;&gt; That ministry, what it does is it comes down like a like a sword, piercing even the dividing of the false suns &gt;&gt; even to the soul. tomorrow comes right down in pricks into our hearts &gt;&gt; and we go, "That's me. &gt;&gt; I needed that." &gt;&gt; God will bring a man 4,000 miles away &gt;&gt; that can't preach his way out of a bucket &gt;&gt; to speak to you. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; It's a part of the process. &gt;&gt; In that process, there's going to come a coordination day, though. &gt;&gt; You see a man getting ready for the Olympics, Paul talks about the Olympics, &gt;&gt; talks about running, winning a prize. THAT OLYMPIC ATHLETE, HE GETS UP AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING, MAYBE EARLIER, AND HE TRAINS ALL OF HIS life &gt;&gt; for a few seconds. &gt;&gt; JUST A FEW SECONDS TO SHOW WHAT GOD HAS DID FOR HIM. GIVE THAT GIFT IN HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; He just works and he WORKS AND HE TUNES HIS BODY AND HE TUNES HIS BODY AND HE TUNES HIS BODY TO GET READY TO USE THAT GIFT. WHATEVER IT WAS GIVES HIM. HE GOES AND DOES THAT, BUT THAT DOESN'T FULFILL IT. &gt;&gt; HE MIGHT STAND THERE ON THE STAND AND EVERYBODY SAYS, "OH, I'D LIKE TO be like that." &gt;&gt; Listen, one of these days there's going to be angels stand. &gt;&gt; There's going TO BE A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT GOD HAS SENT THROUGH THE process &gt;&gt; that he wrote a covenant with. I'LL BE WITH YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS. &gt;&gt; IF YOU ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN YOU, ASK WHAT YOU WILL. &gt;&gt; IT MIGHT BE THE DARKEST OF THE NIGHT, BUT I'LL BE WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; THE PAIN MAY BE SO GREAT. THAT BIRTH PAIN MAY BE SO HORRIBLE, &gt;&gt; but I'll be with you. &gt;&gt; Soon the lamb will take his bride. to be ever by his side. &gt;&gt; All the host of heaven will assemble be. Oh, it will be a glorious sight. &gt;&gt; All the saints and spotless wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And with Jesus, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; we're going to spend Eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come and die. &gt;&gt; The master's calling &gt;&gt; come and die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've been through the process. &gt;&gt; We fed and WE FED AND WE BATTLED AND WE'VE BATTLED. REWARD ONE MORNING. I'M GOING TO TAKE A step &gt;&gt; I'm GOING TO TAKE A step &gt;&gt; into my theophony. &gt;&gt; They're going to take a half a step this way &gt;&gt; and I'm going to take a HALF A STEP THAT WAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, BROTHER RON, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE STILL THE SAME. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THERE'S A PROCESS CALLED THE RAPTURE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON DOWN IN HERE FOR A LONG TIME. &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN MOLDING AND REFLECTING HIMSELF DOWN INSIDE OF HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; One morning, he's going to call us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Time to come home, bro. &gt;&gt; We're going to hear not the footprints of Philistine horses, &gt;&gt; but we're going to hear a buck board wagon &gt;&gt; come over a hillside. &gt;&gt; Then all THE COUSINS CAN LAUGH ALL THEY WANT. &gt;&gt; Can &gt;&gt; because the dress fits. It fits exactly right. &gt;&gt; You know, in a marriage that man can have the best tuxedo in the world on nobody pays no attention. &gt;&gt; He can HAVE ALL THE BELLS AND THE WHISTLES AND THE STRAPS, HAVE HIS HAIR ALL GOOED UP. NOBODY PAYS NO ATTENTION. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THAT DOOR OPENS UP, &gt;&gt; every eye, &gt;&gt; EVERY EYE IN THE WHOLE BUILDING GOES, &gt;&gt; it fits. &gt;&gt; She's here. Every eye in the universe &gt;&gt; every eye in the universe &gt;&gt; IS WATCHING THE bride &gt;&gt; oh soon the lamb will take his &gt;&gt; bride &gt;&gt; to be ever at his side &gt;&gt; all the hostal ALL THE HOST OF heaven &gt;&gt; will assemble me. &gt;&gt; We'll say goodbye in a few minutes, BUT AFTER A WHILE, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAY GOODBYE NO MORE. &gt;&gt; OH, IT WILL BE A GLORIOUS NIGHT. ALL OF YOU INSPIRE US. &gt;&gt; WHY? &gt;&gt; And with Jesus, we're going to spend eternity. &gt;&gt; Oh, come and die. The master is calling. Come and die. &gt;&gt; You may face that Jesus. Let's stand. Come and &gt;&gt; oh soon the lamb take his bride. I'm going to be ever at his side. &gt;&gt; Oh it will be a glorious sight. All the saints spotless. &gt;&gt; Oh, come and the master is calling. &gt;&gt; You may face that Jesus table. He who fed the multitude turns the water into wine to the hungry cord. Now come and die. Sing it for you. Soon the lamb is going to take his bride to be ever. &gt;&gt; You believe that with all your heart. or to be a glorious sign. All the saints follow and with Jesus. Oh, come and die. &gt;&gt; He who fed the multitude, turn the water into wine. To the hungry, call it now. Come and die. Oh, come and die. Let me hear it. You may be at Jesus table all the time. He who turn into wine. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's been a wonderful time we've had &gt;&gt; and it's just we're just in the process. You know, two years ago at camp, uh, we had an unusual camp that two years ago. And it was largely because there were so many of you that are seniors now, two years younger, two or three years younger, but some were 14 and 15. And we had a we had a very, very young senior camp. Right. &gt;&gt; And brother Tom and I discussed it and spoke about it and said, you know, we've never had a camp quite like this. It just they're so young. We don't hardly know how to handle uh such a young group. Generally, we've had, you know, seniors that are 17, 18, 19 like that. And uh we we I think reacted better. We uh we were more prepared for that kind of a camp. And then this camp been very very different. Very different because we had a lot of, you know, what we'd say kind of teeny boppers at that time. And they hadn't quite found their teenage legs yet. And they had, you know, uh, all kinds of problems just, you know, kind of trying to find their, you know, their place and, uh, you know, kind of find their space sort of thing. and we had to kind of go along with that. This year, uh, it was a distinct difference. There was, you know, more settled. &gt;&gt; Some of those that had all kinds of difficulties back then, two years ago, they're through it now. &gt;&gt; They want to get on with God. &gt;&gt; Back then, they didn't know whether, you know, what they wanted to do, just listen to a bunch of music or do this or be with my friends. My friends, I heard that so I'm just sick. My friends, who in the worlds are your friends? Your friends are real men and women, real sons and daughters of God. My friends, some of them already on the other side. And all my friends, all that I consider my friends are going to be on the other side. They're going to be robed in spotless white. That's my friends. That's my friends. I feel serious about that. And so this year it has been uh different because I want to say to you that are campers uh you you've come a distance now in a couple two three years and our brother Spencer preaching today was allowing you to know that maybe tomorrow morning or on down the road you'll be in the process. You're still in the process. But there comes a time and I believe for many of you that this is the time that uh all the frivolous things &gt;&gt; leave, &gt;&gt; they depart. And if it hasn't happened yet, it needs to. &gt;&gt; The sooner you young men and young women realize that life is full of serious things because you're going to run into you're going to run into times this process. It's not just for a select few. &gt;&gt; We'll all have it. You'll all have an experience. You'll all have tough times. You'll have times. Why don't you just sit down for a few moments? I'm not going to preach, but I want to we want to close the camp. You all I want especially all the campers, you all are going to have a time. Let me say something. There isn't one young man or one young woman sitting here listening to brother Biscll at this moment. But what you are going to arrive at a day if you don't make a serious commitment to God, you're going to arrive at a day that you're going to regret regret it deeply. And when you get down into your deepest pit of despair, and you find everything going sideways, &gt;&gt; maybe it'll be some catastrophic thing, some trauma of some sort, maybe it's something physical, maybe an accident. Let me tell you something. If you have an accident, I want to make it serious. If you have an accident, you're not going to call some of these that you've called your friends &gt;&gt; that you're not going to call the guy that handed you uh a cigarette. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CALL THE guy who's hand you a can of beer. &gt;&gt; You're not going to call them. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "WHERE'S BROTHER TOM? WHERE'S BROTHER ED? &gt;&gt; WHERE'S MY GODLY FATHER AND MY MOTHER? &gt;&gt; I WANT THEM." RIGHT? &gt;&gt; DON'T BE A coward and call them then. &gt;&gt; DO IT NOW. &gt;&gt; MAKE YOUR DECISION NOW. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T WANT TO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAY, "OH, DEVIL, HELP ME." &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "GOD, HELP ME." &gt;&gt; And you WANT TO BE ON GOOD SPEAKING TERMS. I'm telling you from my OWN LIFE. I HAVE PEOPLE THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY JUST PLAY AROUND WITH GOD, &gt;&gt; but then when they get into a real difficult time, THEY WANT TO CALL SOMEBODY WHO THEY KNOW knows how to pray. &gt;&gt; When Brother Ron told me about falling onto that concrete driveway and breaking his entire back and crushing four of his vertebraes. He told me that personally and he was going THROUGH HIS PROCESS. WHO WOULD EXPECT THAT GOD WOULD TAKE a brother that could come here and you WOULD SO ENJOY? &gt;&gt; WHO WOULD EXPECT THAT GOD WOULD ALLOW HIM TO go through that? And maybe his daddy AND HIS MOM WOULD SAY, "WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW? WE WE PLAYED THE TAPE. WE BELIEVED THE MESSAGE. WE DID EVERYTHING WE KNOW HOW." AND WE GOT A SON LAYING IN THE IN THE TRAUMA IN THE ICU WITH A BACK ALL BROKEN AND CRUSHED AND A DOCTOR TELLING US HE'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN. &gt;&gt; But he told me of his dad walking in. I know I know his daddy since 1978. And that brother Spencer, how I love him. He walked in, looked at that son with all those bones broken, said, "I'm a son of God." &gt;&gt; That's the kind of personal &gt;&gt; you're going to need. Then &gt;&gt; if you young people got godly parents, YOU THANK GOD for them &gt;&gt; and make a serious commitment. If you haven't come to that, let's not have it frivolous because your life your life's going on two years from now. Things are going to change. You're going to go through some process in the next two years, next year and maybe next week. And I've always said, I want to be on good speaking terms. I don't want to call God. I don't want to call on them just in my hour of need. And you will have it. &gt;&gt; You will have it. one way or another, you will have it. And so, we want to leave the camp joyfully, but also seriously because I want you to be victorious, NOT ONLY IN A CAMP ATMOSPHERE, BUT WHEN YOU'RE ALL ALONE AND YOU HAVE NOBODY BESIDE YOU. WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO LOOK HEAVEN STRAIGHT IN THE FACE, SAY, "GOD, I DROVE MY STAKE DOWN at the camp." And I believe there's been quite a few stakes driven down. I've seen you praying here. I've seen God do some real real not only serious but some deep things. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'd like to say also there's a few things I just want to say. Young people especially, let me tell you honestly, don't let the devil deceive you to think that the preacher's different than you are. He fights the same devils and probably more of them, the same temptations. And when they and when brother Ron Spencer tell you about his life or brother Tom shared with some of you young men about his life and I have told some of mine, don't ever think that the preachers different than you are. WE FOUGHT THE SAME BATTLES, &gt;&gt; WENT THROUGH THE SAME TRIALS, HAVE GONE THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron related and said just a little bit about brother Brandham's in 1962. He doesn't know this, but I was with brother Brandham right at that time when brother Brandham, this might surprise you, when he wanted to quit preaching. And I we talked about the very place that he wanted to buy. He wanted to buy a place up on the Alaskan Highway. He told me how much money he had. He wanted to buy that and he said, "I'll just come here. I'll just bury myself." Do you know why? Do you know why? He said, "The people aren't they're not listening. They want to make something out of him that he said it's not true." And he and he he wanted to quit. He wanted to quit preaching because the people don't listen. That was his process. And next year I saw him. He said, "I believe it's all fixed now. I I believe it's all fixed. If you want to read a message, read Bruce Serpent &gt;&gt; and you see what he went what he went through. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why did he have to go through it?" Well, it was part of the process. I don't know. And we're in part of the process. And so, we just thank God. He will not give us anything more than you are able to bear. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go through this like a coward. &gt;&gt; I don't want to go through it like a coward. And even I I spoke with the brothers who stood by brother Brandham's bed when he was leaving this life. And even then while he couldn't speak, but he was a man and he kn his head and wink his eye and he was he was still you could see that fervor that fight that warrior that soldier was still in him. That's the way we want to be. That's the kind of people that's going to walk in white. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when you young people leave here, I want to say to you, if you're here next year, that you have made a resolve. You've made a resolve that whatever happens. I wonder if you can say that to yourself. Whatever happens, I've said it with God &gt;&gt; and I'm going through. &gt;&gt; I'm going through, Jesus. I'm going through. There isn't anything that can turn me from it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's stand and sing. How many believe they'll be here next year? &gt;&gt; Well, that wasn't very many. If that's all that's coming, we won't have a camp. How many would like to be here next year? &gt;&gt; Good. Still not 100%. How many would like to see our brother Ron here next year? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I've never done that. I've never pulled that on a preacher. Never can. He did it on me. I got to be in his church in two weeks. You know that? He did it on me last year. He said, "How many like TO HAVE BROTHER BISCLL HERE NEXT YEAR?" OH, there it was. It was all done. Obligated me. Brother I'd like to ask and I I don't know. That's why I'm asking. I said, "This isn't a show. I'm just asking." Brother Ron, what are you doing next August? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Now you have something to pray for in the next 12 months. Oh God, THE CAMP NEXT YEAR. OH GOD, THERE'LL BE A REVIVAL. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVEN'T even begun to experience everything that God would love to do. He can sweep through here. I tell you a couple of things. Do you know that a couple of brothers saw a strange cloud hanging over this tent? Do you know that the very next day and they said the cloud was like the one in the picture? Do you know that the next day a sister who knew nothing about it came to me and came to my wife afterwards, she's sitting here now and she was trembling. She was trembling. She said there was not a cloud in the sky. This is the next day from this distance, this distance, not one cloud in the sky. And she said, for no less than five minutes, I saw a cloud. I saw it in the sky. And she said, HAD THE SAME SHAPE AND IT WAS hanging right over this tent. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. He's the same God. The same God. Talk to the woman of the west. Here it is. It's just her testimony. Same God. &gt;&gt; The woman at the well. He's the same God. Too many to tell God raing red sea and he's the same God who is dwelling in me. I lift it up once again. Oh, he's the same God spoke to the well. He's the same God. Too many to tell. The same God, the raging red sea. Oh, he's the same God that live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; Now, I think we've heard the admonition charge. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is not a time of retreat. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in retreats. &gt;&gt; You don't believe in retreats. &gt;&gt; It's the hour of charge. And I want to say God bless you all once again for all that you've done for this camp. You know this is a collective body. &gt;&gt; Somebody will shake your hand say God bless you brother Tom brother Biscoff for all that you've done. You know my quick answer is without all the help camp would never happen. &gt;&gt; Never happen. It's a collective affair. The Bible says in Ephesians 4 that the whole body fitly joins together, compacted by which every joint supply according to the effectual working of the measure of every part. &gt;&gt; It doesn't stop there. Maketh increase. &gt;&gt; That's what's been happening at THIS CAMP. EVERY JOINT SUPPLY MAKING increase within the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; And I say God bless you. counselors, &gt;&gt; assistant counselors. &gt;&gt; Can I just run through a bit here? &gt;&gt; Tent raisers. &gt;&gt; Tent downers. &gt;&gt; Sure. We've got the musicians, THE PIANIST, THE ORGANIST, the guitarist, the drummer, the bass, the trumpet players, the clarinets, EVERY JOINT SUPPLY FOR THE INCREASE OF THE BODY. It doesn't stop there. It goes to the kitchen. &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU'VE HAD THE NATURAL FOOD. YOU'VE HAD THE SPIRITUAL FOOD. WHAT? FOR THE EFFECTUAL WORKING OF THE BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Clean up. It's amazing. I'm humbled. &gt;&gt; MIDNIGHT 12:30 SISTERS WITH THEIR BROOMS. &gt;&gt; That is humbling, brothers. &gt;&gt; They did that for you campers. What a body. LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. WHAT A BODY. NOT IT'S THE EVENING STAFF. YOU GOT THE MORNING STAFF. YOU GOT THE AFTERNOON STAFF. ADD THEM UP. &gt;&gt; Just add it up. &gt;&gt; You've got electricians. YOU GOT VIDEO BROTHERS. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT SOUND BROTHERS. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT COMPUTER BROTHERS. AMEN. WE SHOULD RAISE THIS TENT OFF THIS GROUND. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT? IT'S GOD IN THE PEOPLE. AH, but it DOESN'T STOP THERE. WE GOT THE PROP MAKERS. We got the sisters that do the sewing. WE GOT THE BROTHERS THAT DID THE MORNING DEVOTIONS. WE GOT THE PRESS THE MARK BROTHERS. WE GOT THE ROUNDROBIN SISTERS. YES, SIR. THEN WE GOT DEACONS ON DUTY. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TRUSTEES THAT PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. WE GOT A PASTOR WITH A VISION. I WANT YOU TO APPRECIATE THIS LAST STATEMENT. The young people got together last night to give us an album, the ministry, and Sister Crane and and the and Sister Karen and we're Jess and Lynn. They gave us and and they and you know, they put their money together. They put the pictures together. They put it together. Uh brother I was going to say little brother Jesse. Where's little brother Jesse? I'm glad he's on my side. big brother Jesse stands up and and and gives that to us and he collected now the hours that I just gave you of the different people to put on this camp &gt;&gt; is over 10,000 man hours &gt;&gt; that is every joint &gt;&gt; that's every joint &gt;&gt; and that's not including those that have prayed got on their knees got in their prayer closet held up this camp I say God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I MIGHT NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED YOU, BUT I KNOW THERE'S ONE THAT'S HERE. HE'LL RECOGNIZE YOU. AND ON THAT DAY, ON THAT DAY, HE WILL POUR BACK ABUNDANTLY WITHIN YOUR LIFE. You say, "Brother Tom, why are you so enthused?" I'M ENTHUSED BECAUSE I SAW DEMONS &gt;&gt; LOOSE. I SAW YOUNG PEOPLE DELIVERED. &gt;&gt; AND IF THAT DOESN'T THRILL YOUR HEART, YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE. &gt;&gt; And let me make a statement quotable. Brother Biscll said years ago, a man of God doesn't stand behind his pulpit and just put some quotes together. What you see is a a collection of many, many years of process &gt;&gt; to stand here and minister the way he ministered. And I want to thank the Lord Jesus Christ for the molding process within our dear brother Ron Spencer's life that he could pour out his life and his energies for this body that joint supplying to this body. Do you see the increase within your life? I SAY TO GOD BE THE GLORY. LET THE HALLELUJAH ROLL. I'M LIVING. AS WE GET READY TO GO, LET'S SAY I'M LIVING ON THE HALLELUJAH SIDE. OH, GLORY BE TO JESUS. Can we sing that just before we we're WHO WANTS TO GO? I DON'T WANT TO GO. &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT TO GO. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, &gt;&gt; there's another day &gt;&gt; and we won't have one another. But you got to prove it's this is the hour. &gt;&gt; I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Glory be to Jesus. Let the hand for a while. Oh, make that your confession. And I'm living on the hallelujah. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let my hallelujah. Let me sing and I'm living. Let's sing that one more time for the glory of God. Oh, glory. Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the hallelujah. Let me see all my soul and I'm living on the hallelujah side. Let's give him a praise offering. Amen. Let's give him his LAST PRAISE OFFERING THIS MORNING. THANK HIM FOR WHAT HE'S DONE IN your life today. SAY, "WHAT A TREMENDOUS WEEK IT'S BEEN." AMEN. MORNING, AFTERNOON, EVENING. THE GLORY OF GOD HAS ROLLED THROUGH THIS CAMP. MAY IT CONTINUE TO GO WITH YOU. Heavenly Father, at the close of this camp, we give you glory. &gt;&gt; Lord, we do not lift up any man. We lift up the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; TO GOD BE THE GLORY. GREAT THINGS HE'S DONE. WE GIVE YOU PRAISE, LORD, BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S THE WORD THAT'S PRODUCING A WORD BRIDE. We pray, GOD, THAT YOU WILL BLESS OUR DEAR BROTHER RON. BLESS HIS DEAR WIFE. BLESS HIS HOME. BLESS HIS CHURCH. BLESS THAT LITTLE BODY OF CHRIST THERE. LORD, AS WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED this week, we thank you for one another. We thank you for faithful sisters, a faithful brethren. We thank you for this facility that you open the door for us. We pray God that we can look back Lord maybe last night, this morning, night before, the night before and SAY THAT NIGHT IT WAS AT THAT TIME. &gt;&gt; WE ALWAYS SAY LORD FROM THAT TIME THE BAD THINGS. BUT TODAY WE WANT TO SAY FROM THAT TIME &gt;&gt; FROM THAT TIME &gt;&gt; I LIVE VICTORIOUSLY I LIVE IN VICTORY. &gt;&gt; May we go with such a thankfulness within our hearts. This is a been a blessed time, refreshing time. Lord, we didn't even want this to stop. We just want to move into that next dimension. Lord, that we can sit at your feet, lift up our hands, AND PRAISE YOU THROUGH ALL ETERNITY. &gt;&gt; It's what we're living for, Lord. We believe we're in that rapture cycle. We believe, Lord God, that you have becoming and are becoming so real. So, Lord, with those that will be traveling on the road, watch over them, Lord. And Lord, when we return on Sunday, may there be victory in the camp. &gt;&gt; May this just roll over, Lord. And as we've been having camp meeting after camp meeting before we got here, WHEN WE GET BACK TO THE HOME CHURCH, IT WAS JUST A CONTINUATION OF WHAT WE'VE HAD HERE. &gt;&gt; And we will give you the glory. We will give you the honor. And we will give you the praise, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. Shake one another's hand. You're dismissed in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; All right. Till till we meet again. Till me. Till we meet. is glory. as we go our way. You know what would really help us? really help us. Now, you just pick up your chair and you take it right to this corner right over here. The brothers will be there to show you where to put it. Can you imagine if everybody picked up their chair? It'd hardly take any more time. So, as you're leaving, dismissing, just take it that corner and that'd help us out a lot. God bless you. God bless you, Richie. Oh, the Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, hey. Oh, heat.
