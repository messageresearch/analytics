it's just like you can wear artificial teeth if you have no teeth that that's all right you have to have something to chew with so you get artificial teeth that them teeth's all right the substitute but that them teeth is not connected with you they're not connected there they're all right there substitute but they're not connected with you they'll not come in the resurrection because they're not connected with you that's right if you had an arm cut off you put on an artificial arm it's a substitute to something wear a glove and so that's that's all right it's perfectly all right see to do that but that AR arm will never come nothing artificial will ever come in the resurrection and neither will an artificial Christian ever rise in the resurrection you're not connected with Christ and if you don't truly love your wife better than any other woman in the world she's not yet there something wrong if you don't love your husband if you trifle on him and don't live the right kind of life there's something wrong that's right she'll not it'll not be our soul res you might have married him you're living honorable to him that's fine I I appreciate that you should do that as a lady for your children and you man to your wives that that's right you should be that honorable but in the resurrection that'll not be hurt you just same as in Christ now you've got to be connected part of Christ not something artificial put on I go to church and say the doxology and the Apostles Creed and so forth and I believe I'm running just as well as the rest of them brother you're presuming
