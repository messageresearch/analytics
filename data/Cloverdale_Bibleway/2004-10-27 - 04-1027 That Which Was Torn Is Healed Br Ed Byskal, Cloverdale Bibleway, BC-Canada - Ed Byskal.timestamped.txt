[10:07] Oh, his love
[10:13] when nothing else could have.
[10:26] Amen.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to ask brother
[10:29] John Andy's, brother. John Andy's, if
[10:31] you'd come and open the service in a
[10:33] word of prayer. We have one prayer
[10:35] request from uh Sister Brittney Moore,
[10:38] please pray for my 2-year-old brother
[10:41] Ryan, who will be undergoing undergoing
[10:44] ear surgery uh tomorrow morning. So, we
[10:47] want to remember Sister Britney Moore.
[10:50] Amen. If you've got a prayer request or
[10:52] something heavy on your heart, just
[10:53] raise your hand as we go to prayer.
[10:55] Amen. And if you're on the internet,
[10:56] telephone hookup, just join us. Stand
[10:59] where you are and raise your hand to him
[11:01] as we go to prayer. Brother John.
[11:07] I know it's customary for the person
[11:09] leading in prayer to pray, but I wonder
[11:12] tonight if we could just have each one
[11:13] of you pray in your own special way. The
[11:16] Bible says when the people shall begin
[11:18] to pray.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; So why don't you just pray what's in
[11:21] your own heart. Just lift up your voice
[11:23] tonight. Amen. Father, we lift up our
[11:26] hearts to you and our hands together.
[11:29] Our voices coming before your throne.
[11:32] Not just one, but a whole congregation
[11:34] of believers. First of all, we want to
[11:36] get out of the way. Father, we want to
[11:39] thank you, Lord, for amazing grace. It's
[11:41] because of your hand on our lives that
[11:43] we can stand in your presence. Lifting
[11:46] up our hands, lifting up our hearts,
[11:48] yielding our members, surrendering
[11:50] ourselves, asking that you would come
[11:53] tonight in a special way, visit this
[11:56] address here in Cloverdale. Lord, let
[11:58] all the sin of any lives here be under
[12:01] the blood. Let nothing stand between us
[12:04] tonight. Father, what could you do in
[12:07] your presence, in your house tonight? If
[12:10] every brother and sister here would get
[12:12] out of the way, yield their members.
[12:15] Father, speak to us tonight. Father, let
[12:17] there be a channel opened up, Lord, of
[12:20] praise, of adoration. Father, on a
[12:22] Wednesday night, Lord, we can lift up
[12:24] our voices, lift up our hearts, lift up
[12:27] our needs, Father. Lord, one word spoken
[12:31] from you into our lives. One word from
[12:34] your presence. God, we're waiting on
[12:36] you. For thus sayeth the Lord, in every
[12:39] situation. Hands are lifted up. Father,
[12:42] needs are being expressed. Lord, we
[12:45] believe you're the creator. You're the
[12:47] one, Lord, that same yesterday, today,
[12:49] and forever. You stand in the sanctuary.
[12:53] Lord, we believe men and women bought by
[12:55] your blood, purchased by your very own
[12:57] blood. We've been washed by your
[13:00] cleansing blood. Tonight we stand
[13:02] redeemed. Father, minister to every life
[13:05] that's here. Those out on the internet,
[13:07] those on the phone hook up. Father, may
[13:10] there be a spiritual contact into that
[13:12] other dimension. Jesus, speak to us
[13:15] tonight by your word. Lord, get a hold
[13:18] of the minister's mind. Get a hold of
[13:20] the gift in his life. Speak to every
[13:22] young lady, every young man, every
[13:24] brother, every sister. Father, we're
[13:26] hungry for your voice tonight, Lord.
[13:29] We're happy to be in your presence.
[13:31] Lord, we're grateful that we can be in a
[13:33] place where we can let off the pressure.
[13:35] That in the midst of gross darkness,
[13:38] there's still light. Your spirit is
[13:40] still alive. Your word is still fresh.
[13:43] Father, we pray you'd minister to
[13:44] Brother Ryan. Father, two-year-old
[13:47] Father having a surgery tomorrow.
[13:49] Father, would you open up his hearing?
[13:51] Father, open up our hearing. Father, do
[13:54] a surgery tonight in this building. Let
[13:57] our eyes be open. and let our hearts be
[13:59] opened. Let our desires be quickened.
[14:01] Father, fill our lamps, Lord, with oil.
[14:05] Trim the lamps, Lord. If there's any
[14:06] blackness, any suiness, Lord, take it
[14:09] away, Lord. Anything that would hinder
[14:12] anything that would cause us to fall
[14:13] short or miss the mark, Father, may your
[14:17] spirit, Lord, just go from heart to
[14:19] heart, lamp to lamp, Lord. Quicken us
[14:21] tonight, Jesus. Let there be miracles
[14:24] even tonight, Lord. We believe we're in
[14:27] the season of adoption, Lord, where men
[14:29] and women can speak to the mountain in
[14:31] their lives. They can speak, Lord. He
[14:34] that is in you, Lord. We confess it is
[14:37] you, Lord, that's among us tonight.
[14:39] We're here to give you glory. Here to
[14:42] bow down. Here to worship. Here to say
[14:44] yes to your word. Have your way tonight,
[14:47] Jesus. We sense your presence already.
[14:50] Father, something good is going to
[14:52] happen tonight. You're among us, Lord.
[14:54] You're here. Two or three gathered in
[14:56] your name, Lord. And we've gathered in
[14:59] your name, Jesus. Confirm your word and
[15:02] vindicate your nearness
[15:04] &gt;&gt; by bringing it to pass
[15:06] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once again, I want to welcome
[15:22] everyone tonight. name of our Lord Jesus
[15:24] Christ. You're visiting with us. We want
[15:26] to say God bless you. It's good to have
[15:27] you. I trust you feel welcome in his
[15:30] presence. Amen. Why don't we as we get
[15:31] ready for the word, let's sing that
[15:33] little song. Oh, what a friend who walks
[15:35] beside me, holds my hand.
[15:39] Oh, what a friend
[15:45] who walks beside me
[15:51] to hold my hand
[15:56] and safely
[15:58] guide me.
[16:01] Make me
[16:07] always.
[16:12] Oh, what a friend.
[16:17] He is to me. He knows the way.
[16:23] He knows the way.
[16:28] I go his way
[16:33] and he can't see around
[16:38] my pathway
[16:41] standing.
[16:44] He'll take me through
[16:49] when he is standing.
[16:54] Oh, what a friend.
[17:01] to me for a friend.
[17:04] Oh, what a friend
[17:09] who walks beside me
[17:15] to hold my hand
[17:20] and safely
[17:22] guide me.
[17:25] Safely
[17:30] height
[17:33] me.
[17:35] All I
[17:40] know you are to me. He knows the way. He
[17:46] knows the way.
[17:50] My road is winding
[17:56] and he can't see around
[18:01] my pathway
[18:03] landing.
[18:06] will take me through
[18:11] when
[18:14] he
[18:16] Oh my
[18:27] turn and service brother. Let's sing
[18:28] that little chorus. He is here.
[18:30] Hallelujah. He is here. Amen.
[18:34] He is here.
[18:38] Hallelujah.
[18:43] He is here.
[18:50] He is here.
[18:53] Oh, holy,
[18:56] holy.
[18:58] Oh, I will bless
[19:01] his holy
[19:03] name.
[19:06] Oh, he is here
[19:09] just
[19:29] you will never
[19:32] be
[19:34] the same.
[19:37] Well, a great deal depends on what kind
[19:40] of an order we put in.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; You have to put in an order. I know
[19:46] you've heard it many times, but it's
[19:48] true. You get what you expect.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; So often that's why special meetings are
[19:54] special. There's nothing really a
[19:57] nothing really that different with the
[19:59] preaching
[20:01] or with the preacher or with the people
[20:04] or with the place. What is really
[20:07] different in a special meeting is people
[20:09] come with a whole different expectation
[20:13] &gt;&gt; and they're coming expecting to receive.
[20:15] I'm going to hear something and and they
[20:17] do. Amen. I'm going to receive something
[20:20] and they do. So it shouldn't surprise us
[20:23] &gt;&gt; when people expect to do it
[20:25] &gt;&gt; because that's exactly what he promised.
[20:27] You expect it, you'll receive it.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; So I hope you're expecting something
[20:32] tonight.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; If you didn't put in any order, well,
[20:35] don't be disappointed when you go home
[20:37] with an empty basket. But if you came
[20:39] expecting something, you certainly won't
[20:41] go home empty.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:46] Well, I suppose most of you saw the
[20:47] eclipse of the moon.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; God declaring things in the heavens.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; We don't know uh exactly what's taking
[20:55] place, but something taking place for
[20:56] sure.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; And uh
[21:00] the light testifying once again
[21:05] church ages.
[21:08] The light the light uh being
[21:13] the world getting in the way. the light.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what was wrong with
[21:17] Leodysia.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; But we're not in that age.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; We're in a bright age.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad for bride age.
[21:25] Hallelujah.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Well, I uh I I want to give you just a
[21:30] few uh quick announcements because we
[21:33] don't want to be that long this evening.
[21:35] But on Sunday, which we've announced,
[21:37] we're having a communion, Lord's table,
[21:39] footwashing Sunday evening. And on there
[21:44] will be quite a number coming up from
[21:46] Seattle. I don't know how many, but as
[21:48] many as possibly can are coming up from
[21:50] Seattle. My wife and I went to uh Tacoma
[21:55] uh yesterday.
[21:57] Going to have to do something with this
[21:58] equipment.
[22:11] Let's use this one.
[22:13] Let's take it off.
[22:17] This is exactly what I had to do at the
[22:18] last series of meetings. They had me one
[22:20] of these new fan tangle things. I said,
[22:24] "Take it off and let me preach with this
[22:26] old one. I'm going to learn that song.
[22:28] There'll be no wires in heaven." For
[22:30] sure.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; My dislike for wires is growing into
[22:38] something that's even deeper than
[22:40] dislike.
[22:42] I can guarantee you there's no wires in
[22:45] heaven.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; We just get into something important and
[22:48] then they start to fail us. Uh but on uh
[22:51] we went down and were with our brother
[22:54] Anatoli from Usbekiststan.
[22:57] He has just arrived from touring a
[23:00] number of places in the states. Some
[23:02] places he had relatives and people from
[23:05] his city that are scattered in different
[23:08] places in Europe and also in the states.
[23:11] Some are in Germany and I think he was
[23:13] with some down in Florida. His
[23:16] brother-in-law is in the Tri Cities,
[23:18] Washington State. And so he was there
[23:21] and his brother-in-law I think and
[23:22] sister drove him over to brother
[23:24] Machmoods. And then we drove down and
[23:27] spent the evening with them about 3
[23:29] hours or so to late uh last evening
[23:33] and uh then drove back partly last night
[23:36] and partly this morning making it quite
[23:39] a long day. But he said that some of the
[23:42] people from Tri Cities, he doesn't know
[23:45] how many, but they're going to drive all
[23:47] the way so they can be here for Sunday
[23:49] evening service. And I understand that
[23:51] one or maybe more want to be rebaptized.
[23:55] So, uh, he said his brother-in-law wants
[23:58] to be rebaptized. They're Pentecostal
[24:00] people. Uh, so we don't know what to
[24:03] expect for Sunday evening, but we're
[24:05] just expecting a great time, and quite
[24:07] frankly, we don't care how long the
[24:09] service goes on. We're going to have the
[24:11] Lord's table. We're going to have foot
[24:13] washing. We're going to probably have
[24:14] baptism. We're going to take our time
[24:16] and just let God have his way.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's so wonderful.
[24:23] One of the things that I wanted to ask
[24:24] you as a congregation to do, if you
[24:27] could please open your homes to those
[24:31] that come up, quite often they just stay
[24:33] in their vans or maybe stay around the
[24:35] church or something. They have to start
[24:38] very early to drive two and a half,
[24:40] three hours to get here for the service
[24:42] at 10:30. Then they want to stay for the
[24:45] evening service. So they have the whole
[24:47] afternoon and uh and then go into the
[24:50] evening service. I think we might even
[24:52] start the evening service a little bit
[24:54] early. I didn't say anything about that,
[24:55] but it wouldn't hurt. And started just a
[24:58] wee bit early. Uh, and then if you could
[25:01] have some of them over to your home,
[25:03] what I suggest is that you call Sister
[25:04] Bonnie and say, "We could have four
[25:07] over." If you have children, there are
[25:09] some of them that have children, but
[25:11] what I really am requesting that you do
[25:14] is do not visit throughout the
[25:16] afternoon. give them a bite of lunch and
[25:18] show them a bed where they can rest and
[25:20] and get some rest so they can be
[25:23] refreshed for the evening service and
[25:25] and be refreshed to drive home because
[25:27] then they have another three-hour trip
[25:29] home. So, I appreciate them coming. I
[25:32] appreciate it very very deeply and I
[25:34] think as a congregation and some of you
[25:36] young couples that just got married I
[25:38] tell you what as I I've said to in fact
[25:41] as one of the sisters one of the
[25:43] weddings I conducted uh sister told my
[25:45] wife today she said she remembers
[25:47] standing here and her and her husband to
[25:50] be as they were being united and I said
[25:52] to them you be given to hospitality
[25:56] open your home and be given to
[25:57] hospitality and God will bless you and
[25:59] they said that became a part of their
[26:00] life they said they have a small place,
[26:02] just small quarters, a small rented
[26:05] place, but their home is open. And they
[26:07] fed probably hundreds of people in that
[26:10] home that I know about. And I would
[26:12] suggest that you do that. Don't lift to
[26:14] yourself. That's this society. Don't
[26:16] lift to yourself. Open it up and have
[26:18] them sleeping in there and whatever
[26:20] more.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; And the people said,
[26:24] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[26:25] God will bless you for it.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Absolutely will bless you for it. Uh, I
[26:30] have a special announcement here.
[26:33] A special evening.
[26:36] You want to listen to this real close.
[26:38] Those of you that it pertains to. A
[26:41] special evening for young wives
[26:44] and mothers with babies or children 12
[26:48] years and under.
[26:51] Don't say mine was just 12 and just
[26:54] turned 13 last week. This is 12 and
[26:58] under
[27:00] and this will be on Tuesday, November
[27:03] the 9th.
[27:05] The time will be 700 p.m.
[27:08] It will be in the fellowship room.
[27:11] And uh if you are a young married woman
[27:15] without children as yet or if you are a
[27:20] mother with a baby or children 12 years
[27:23] and under, this meeting is for you.
[27:27] Mothers, bring your nursing babies, but
[27:29] arrange for someone to care for your
[27:32] toddlers and other children at home. And
[27:34] this announcement will be on the
[27:36] bulletin board, Tuesday, November the
[27:39] 9th. Brother Ernie called just before I
[27:42] came to church and we had a couple times
[27:45] to get through. And uh this week, this
[27:50] coming week starting Monday is what is
[27:52] called All Saints in the Catholic
[27:54] Church, a Catholic religion. It's called
[27:56] All Saints Day or All Saints Week. And
[27:59] they have some kind of festivities
[28:01] throughout that time. It's a big deal in
[28:04] nations that are largely Catholic. So
[28:06] the Philippines almost shuts down. This
[28:09] is the week that they chose to have a
[28:12] whole week of special meetings. And
[28:14] brother Michelle is leaving tomorrow
[28:16] morning because brother brother Tony,
[28:19] brother Ernie wanted to really give a a
[28:23] first class video, a report of what
[28:27] takes place in these mystery expos. This
[28:29] is really remarkable things that are
[28:31] happening in the Philippines. and
[28:34] they're expecting about 1,500 people on
[28:36] Monday, this coming Monday. Then they
[28:39] expect out of that will be about 250
[28:42] ministers.
[28:44] He was telling me that uh quite a few
[28:46] ministers who have been uh to the
[28:49] mystery expose are and are wrestling
[28:51] with the message. They of course they
[28:53] haven't had a whole lot of instruction,
[28:55] but they're coming back for the second
[28:57] time because they want to hear more
[29:00] things. and uh and some of them from the
[29:03] islands. There's as you know the
[29:04] Philippines or maybe you don't know
[29:06] Philippines has about 7,000 islands and
[29:09] ministers are calling from the islands
[29:11] and so it's difficult for them to make
[29:13] their way but they're going to make
[29:14] their way and come during this week. And
[29:17] then on Tuesday and Wednesday they'll be
[29:20] having ministers meetings and on
[29:23] Thursday and Friday they're going to
[29:25] have a mystery expo right in Manila. And
[29:28] then uh Saturday and Sunday we'll be
[29:30] closing with special meetings. Uh so
[29:33] this is a whole week of meetings uh and
[29:36] different different types of meetings
[29:38] that are taking place and uh uh so we
[29:41] want to pray that the Holy Spirit will
[29:44] really move through these brothers and
[29:46] some of the senior pastors in Manila are
[29:49] are taking the uh the most of the
[29:53] responsibility and brother Ernie will be
[29:55] speaking as well.
[29:58] I would like to tell you also on Sunday
[30:00] you opened your hearts and an offering
[30:03] was given for uh brother and sister
[30:05] childers. I I want to let you know it
[30:08] was $4,445
[30:11] and they just broke down and wept when
[30:14] when I I gave them the check. And so we
[30:17] want to thank you for that. And I felt
[30:18] you needed to know and they certainly
[30:21] have place for that. Uh those funds,
[30:23] they needed them very very badly. But
[30:25] thank you so much. Yesterday when we
[30:28] were with or day before yesterday when
[30:30] we were with brother Anatoli,
[30:34] I asked him uh because brother Makmood
[30:38] brought out his little computer and I
[30:39] brought mine out because he had some
[30:41] questions and so I was looking uh up
[30:44] some references and I said, "Do you have
[30:47] a computer?" He said, "No."
[30:51] I said, "Uh, would you like a computer?"
[30:55] He says, "It's the dream of my life."
[30:58] Uh, Brother Makmood said, he said, "But
[31:01] my computer has the Russian Bible in it.
[31:04] It has all the Russian messages, 260ome
[31:08] messages, all in Russian language. It's
[31:10] all here." And he said, "I have all the
[31:13] pictures of Brother Brandham. I have all
[31:15] the things loaded down." And I said,
[31:18] "Well, I just knew that you would want
[31:20] to do it." and we want to do it as a
[31:21] church. So, we have bought brother
[31:23] Anatoli a computer and he's going to go
[31:26] home with a notebook computer all loaded
[31:29] up. He leaves tomorrow and I think that
[31:32] that is uh something that you would want
[31:34] have wanted me to do. And so, how many
[31:37] computers do we have here in this
[31:39] church?
[31:40] Hold your hands up high. Look at that.
[31:43] And here's a minister with 250 people in
[31:48] his church and in his area and
[31:50] ministering to all kinds of other people
[31:53] and doesn't have that very valuable
[31:57] uh resource and technology. It was the
[32:00] only right thing. It would have been a
[32:01] sin for me to walk out of that house and
[32:05] leave him to go home empty-handed. I
[32:08] just felt smitten. I said, "No, this is
[32:12] so when you give, you must know that
[32:14] this is what happens on a pretty regular
[32:17] basis."
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that's why God has blessed
[32:20] the church here
[32:21] &gt;&gt; because we've just given. That's been a
[32:23] part of our whole part of our whole uh
[32:27] character. It's a It should be the
[32:29] character of the church. Should be the
[32:30] character of our assemblies, our our
[32:33] homes, our families. And if you give, I
[32:36] have a law right here,
[32:41] it shall be given
[32:44] &gt;&gt; to you again.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Shaken down,
[32:48] &gt;&gt; pressed down,
[32:50] &gt;&gt; and
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. That's good. All right.
[32:57] Uh, brother Ken Ken Ardal and and
[33:00] brother Vin are in Grenada right now. I
[33:04] don't know if brother Vin has left but
[33:05] they went together on Monday morning
[33:08] from Trinidad
[33:10] and there is materials that are coming
[33:13] in to build 15 of the believers homes.
[33:17] Now these aren't homes as I said earlier
[33:19] not like we have but 15 places of
[33:22] shelter and will be a home for them
[33:25] similar to what they had before the
[33:26] destruction came and probably a lot
[33:29] better. So I'd like you to remember
[33:30] praying for them. Uh I got a quite a
[33:34] lengthy email from brother Milco today
[33:36] who's in Slovenia. He's been there I
[33:38] think 12 days. He his uh his sister who
[33:43] lost her husband not too long ago. Oh,
[33:46] there's so many things to say. Uh
[33:49] brother Milo's uh family have been
[33:51] Catholic, you know, and uh his sister uh
[33:55] Maria, I believe her name is, and her
[33:58] husband's name was Eddie. and he passed
[34:01] away not very long ago. Well, he was a
[34:04] engineer on a train and his train ran
[34:08] into uh ran ran into Italy and we needed
[34:14] to get the messages into Yugoslavia when
[34:17] it was still very very tight. You
[34:19] couldn't get them in or get turned away
[34:20] at the border. So we asked him if he
[34:24] would, you know, take the if we could
[34:26] ship them into Italy and he'd pick them
[34:28] up there in Triesta and take them on his
[34:31] train back. Oh, he thought that was the
[34:33] greatest thing in the world if he could
[34:34] just smuggle in some books into the
[34:36] country. So he became our main smuggler
[34:39] for a few years. And uh he was just
[34:43] delighted. He just delighted that he
[34:45] could smuggle those books into the
[34:47] country. So now here, brother Milo was
[34:51] there with uh his wife, Milco's sister,
[34:55] and uh she had a kidney stone. He had to
[34:57] take her to the hospital. So he took her
[34:59] to the hospital and they in the hospital
[35:02] they got her in a room where there was I
[35:04] think three other women. Uh he said two
[35:07] of them were at least in their 70s. And
[35:10] so they they, you know, they were just
[35:13] visiting together uh on nothing special.
[35:17] And in walks the priest and soon as the
[35:20] priest walked in, one woman quickly put
[35:22] her hand to her face like that. So I
[35:25] guess so he couldn't really see who she
[35:27] was, but she wanted to give Milo a
[35:28] signal and she just opened her eyes big
[35:31] and rolled them, you know, around and oh
[35:34] boy, you know, here he is sort of thing.
[35:36] And uh uh and the priest saw her and and
[35:41] had a reaction. He just he just hustled
[35:43] right out of there and got right out of
[35:45] there. And she just starts saying, "He's
[35:47] the biggest crook in the world. This and
[35:50] that. I've had so many things happen."
[35:52] And so on and she just began to pour it
[35:54] all out. And of course then another
[35:56] woman got into the act with her and they
[35:59] were kind of one mind. So they went at
[36:01] it for about 45 minutes. and mil and
[36:05] brother Milco, he just sitting there
[36:06] listening. So he said finally he wanted
[36:09] to let them know not everything in the
[36:11] world was bad. So he started to bring to
[36:13] them the message and and if they'd be
[36:15] interested, he has some books in the
[36:17] Slovenian language out in his car. Yes,
[36:20] they would love to have those books. So
[36:22] he goes out, gets all the books he has
[36:25] and distributes them to these women. And
[36:28] soon as he looks to his sister, his
[36:30] sister's all disgusted and she's almost
[36:33] angry that he didn't give her some books
[36:39] all these years later. So he had to
[36:41] plead with these other ladies to please
[36:43] release a book or two and give it to his
[36:45] sister to appease her. And so here her
[36:48] husband years ago uh uh you know he
[36:50] smuggled all these books into the
[36:52] country and now his wife is desiring
[36:55] these books and and it just opened such
[36:57] a wonderful door. Brother Milco said
[36:59] please have the congregation remember me
[37:01] in prayer right now at this time and
[37:04] remember his sister. So we want to do
[37:06] that just as we're going to be turning
[37:07] to the word in a few moments. Uh I
[37:11] believe that I have covered everything
[37:13] that I need to cover. So God bless you.
[37:16] Let's stand to our feet and I'd like to
[37:18] sing more of you. More of you.
[37:22] We're going to come to the word and and
[37:24] uh tonight I would like to lay a
[37:26] foundation for Sunday morning. the Lord
[37:27] willing.
[37:30] More
[37:38] of you.
[37:43] I tell it all
[37:51] of you.
[37:55] of things that have my
[38:04] heart s
[38:21] and
[38:23] Lord hear my prayer.
[38:26] All of you once again.
[38:35] Lord hear my prayer.
[38:44] Lord, I know that this is the cry of
[38:46] every single person that is here and
[38:49] those of our internet congregation. God
[38:52] bless them. Bless those that are not
[38:56] able to be with us tonight. I pray in a
[38:59] special way that you will be present
[39:01] with us in Sunday's services. Oh Lord,
[39:05] you'll anoint the word, anoint the
[39:07] ministry. Oh God, be with our brother
[39:10] Thomas. is uh speaking in Saskatchewan.
[39:13] Oh God, our brother Murphy, Father,
[39:15] Brother Tony, Sister Rebecca, Brother
[39:18] Ernie, oh God, I pray that you'll bless
[39:20] them. Anoint each one of us, Father,
[39:24] according to your perfect will and what
[39:27] you purpose to do in each service. And I
[39:30] pray tonight, Lord, that you will just
[39:32] take in a very divine, sovereign way
[39:35] your word and touch us, Lord. Touch us
[39:39] with a divine touch
[39:41] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Anoint us,
[39:44] Lord. And Father, as I saw the eclipse
[39:47] tonight, couldn't help but pray.
[39:51] May the cross eclipse the speaker
[39:53] tonight. We want to see Christ and him
[39:57] crucified
[39:59] and the preaching which is of the cross,
[40:01] which is the power of God. Anoint us, we
[40:04] pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[40:08] I'm reading out of uh Ephesians the 2
[40:11] chapter
[40:16] and we'll start with verse one.
[40:20] And you hath he quickened who were dead
[40:23] in trespasses and sins, wherein in time
[40:27] past ye walked according to the course
[40:29] of this world, according to the prince
[40:32] of the power of the air, the spirit that
[40:35] now workketh in the children of
[40:37] disobedience,
[40:38] among whom also we all had our
[40:42] conversation in times past in the lust
[40:45] of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of
[40:48] the flesh and of the mind and were by
[40:51] nature the children of wrath even as
[40:53] others. But God who is rich in mercy.
[40:57] For this great love wherewith he hath
[40:59] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[41:03] hath quickened us together with Christ
[41:06] by grace are ye saved. And hath raised
[41:09] us up together and made us sit in sit
[41:12] together in heavenly places in Christ
[41:14] Jesus. that in the ages to come he might
[41:17] show the exceeding riches of his grace
[41:21] in his kindness toward us through Christ
[41:24] Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through
[41:27] faith and that not of yourselves. It is
[41:30] the gift of God, not of works, lest any
[41:33] man should boast. For we are his
[41:36] workmanship. If you would please uh look
[41:39] at this 10th verse. We are his
[41:41] workmanship,
[41:42] created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
[41:46] which God hath before ordained that we
[41:49] should walk in them. Wherefore remember
[41:52] that ye being in time past Gentiles in
[41:57] the flesh, who were called
[41:59] uncircumcision,
[42:00] by that which is called the circumcision
[42:03] in the flesh, made by hands,
[42:07] that at that time ye were without
[42:10] Christ, being aliens from the
[42:12] commonwealth of Israel, and strangers
[42:15] from the covenants of promise, having no
[42:18] hope, and without God in the world. But
[42:22] now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes
[42:25] were a far off are made nigh by the
[42:28] blood of Christ. Amen. God bless you as
[42:32] you have your seats.
[42:34] Uh if you keep your Bible just opened,
[42:38] I'm looking at verse 12.
[42:43] that at that time
[42:46] you were without Christ, being aliens
[42:48] from the commonwealth of Israel, and
[42:51] strangers from the covenants of promise,
[42:55] having no hope, and without God in the
[42:58] world. Scripture uses a a strange word
[43:01] here that we don't see too often in the
[43:04] Bible, that you are aliens.
[43:07] uh aliens
[43:09] from the and and strangers, but you are
[43:13] aliens from the commonwealth of Israel.
[43:16] An alien is one uh we're familiar with
[43:20] it, but say it's one that's from another
[43:23] country, a foreigner. We were foreign to
[43:28] the Commonwealth of Israel.
[43:31] It refers also to difference of birth.
[43:34] If you're a foreigner, you have a
[43:36] different birth. And so, we were aliens
[43:40] from the commonwealth of Israel because
[43:43] we didn't have the right birth.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; We were born in the world, but we
[43:47] weren't born again.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; So, we were foreigners to the and aliens
[43:53] to the commonwealth of Israel. Yeah,
[43:55] &gt;&gt; we were one estranged or excluded from
[44:00] We were excluded from the commonwealth
[44:02] of Israel. Another uh another adjective
[44:06] is we were disconnected.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; We were disconnected from it. There was
[44:12] no connection.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; It took Calvary to connect us.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; We were disconnected from the
[44:17] commonwealth. We were hostile. We were
[44:21] opposed
[44:22] &gt;&gt; from the commonwealth, from that which
[44:24] was holy. We didn't have any rapport
[44:27] with that which was clean, that which
[44:29] was holy, till the Holy Spirit began to
[44:32] brood over us. We went our own way,
[44:35] &gt;&gt; desiring our own things and doing our
[44:37] own things. And lastly, but not least,
[44:40] we were not only opposed, but we were
[44:42] contrary. Paul is saying we were aliens,
[44:46] foreigners, disconnected from another
[44:49] birth by a wrong birth and we were
[44:53] disassociated.
[44:54] We were made so
[44:57] through our parents, Adam and Eve.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "In works is
[45:02] faith expressed." And I I have some of
[45:05] these prepared to show you on the
[45:06] screen, but Lord willing, I will do it
[45:09] on on Sunday. I already have some of it
[45:11] prepared because it's it's nice when you
[45:14] see it visually and can see in the quote
[45:18] what is emphasized to myself. So it was
[45:21] be emphasized to you. But he says here
[45:24] in works of faith expressed he said like
[45:27] my little eagle the little eagle story
[45:29] that he tells. He said he knew when he
[45:32] heard that scream of that mother eagle
[45:35] he said there's a lot of difference
[45:36] between that and the cluck of a hen.
[45:39] Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; See, a lot of times all we knew is that
[45:43] the clock didn't mean a whole lot to us,
[45:45] &gt;&gt; but we hadn't heard the scream yet.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; We only heard the clock and we heard the
[45:50] clock and it didn't sound right and the
[45:52] food wasn't quite right and we weren't
[45:54] satisfied and and and and yet we just
[45:57] kind of went in our own way, but we we
[45:59] didn't feel fully connected with that
[46:01] and we weren't connected with with
[46:03] eternal life. He said, "But see because
[46:05] he was an eagle from the egg.
[46:08] He was right eagle from the egg. He
[46:11] wasn't made an eagle eagle right then."
[46:14] &gt;&gt; See, he always was an eagle.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; You weren't made a Christian. And then
[46:19] he goes on to say, "And a Christian
[46:20] always was."
[46:22] &gt;&gt; I like that. A Christian always was. You
[46:25] didn't know it till God brooded upon you
[46:28] and brought you to the realization. A
[46:31] Christian always was. And that's the
[46:33] reason the divorce when you're divorced
[46:36] because you were trapped into it. See,
[46:38] we were divorced from God. I want to I
[46:41] want to enlarge on that. We were
[46:43] divorced by our parents who who had
[46:47] absolute fellowship and complete
[46:50] communion with God through them because
[46:54] they were separated from God. They
[46:56] became divorced from God. That's the
[46:58] terminology brother Brandham's using
[47:00] here. And because we were trapped into
[47:02] it by that natural birth, we we were
[47:06] born in the world, divorced from God,
[47:08] disconnected from him.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. And we were
[47:12] trapped into it. He said, "By your first
[47:14] parent, Adam and Eve."
[47:18] You know, Brother Brandham uses the term
[47:20] parent singular
[47:23] quite often when he refers to Adam and
[47:25] Eve because the Bible does exactly the
[47:28] same thing. Did you know that?
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible uses that same thing. Do
[47:33] you have your Bible with you? Just turn
[47:35] with me to uh Genesis the 5th chapter.
[47:43] Many of you are familiar with this and
[47:44] some are not. And I just want to do it
[47:47] because it's a
[47:49] bit of a study.
[47:54] Genesis 5 and1.
[47:58] This is the book of the generations
[48:02] of Adam. In the day that God created man
[48:06] in the likeness of God made he him. Now
[48:11] let's read together the second verse.
[48:14] Male and female created he them. Stop.
[48:18] Plural
[48:20] them. Plural.
[48:23] We'll carry on. and blessed them and
[48:27] called their plural name Adam singular.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; In the day when they plural were
[48:38] created.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham states
[48:41] it that way.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Their your parent Adam and Eve
[48:51] &gt;&gt; singular.
[48:53] And he says you were first by your first
[48:56] parent Adam and Eve. He said you be you
[49:00] become a sinner by nature. You didn't
[49:03] want to be but now you heard the gospel
[49:07] and faith cometh by hearing. Revelation
[49:10] comes by hearing. And there's a little
[49:13] something inside of you.
[49:17] Paul says in Romans, "Wherefore, as by
[49:20] one man sin entered into the world, and
[49:23] death by sin, and so sin passed upon all
[49:27] men, for that all have sinned." Brother
[49:31] Brandham says the first nature
[49:35] was to love the world.
[49:38] And thus, if the love for the world is
[49:40] still in us, I'm saying this now. If the
[49:43] love for the world is still in us, we
[49:45] have never been born of the spirit of
[49:47] God. Because the spirit of God can't
[49:49] love the world.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; They're opposed one to the other.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; So that's why the scripture says if we
[49:55] love the world, the love of the father,
[49:58] love of the father, not love for the
[50:00] father, but the love of the father is
[50:03] not in us. Right?
[50:05] &gt;&gt; And so Paul is saying, "Wherefore, as by
[50:08] one man sin entered into the world
[50:10] because Adam took the responsibility for
[50:13] his wife Eve." And I want to come into
[50:15] that now in the invisible union. Brother
[50:18] Brandham says, "For your first na your
[50:22] first husband
[50:24] that had rule over you was your nature
[50:29] by natural birth."
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Your first husband. That's why you had
[50:34] to have a divorce
[50:35] &gt;&gt; from him.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Your first husband
[50:39] that had rule over you was your nature
[50:42] by natural birth. Natural you love the
[50:46] world because you are the world and part
[50:50] of the world. Is that right? Your
[50:53] desires was by nature to love the world
[50:57] which you're a part of. I need to
[50:59] establish this and need to really nail
[51:02] it down. You're you're a part of nature.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; You believe that and that's your natural
[51:08] thing. That's the reason you have to be
[51:11] born again.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; See,
[51:15] &gt;&gt; and you couldn't be born again till your
[51:17] first husband died. And the only way he
[51:19] could die, the only way that nature
[51:20] could die was Christ took it to the
[51:22] cross and it died. and you were
[51:26] separated by the death of his body, so
[51:28] you could be married again to another,
[51:30] even to him, Paul said, who raised from
[51:33] the dead.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; We're not united to the image that the
[51:39] denominational in the church world has
[51:42] of a Christ that walked here 2,000 years
[51:44] ago, even though it's the same Christ,
[51:46] but yet it's not exactly the same Christ
[51:48] because he will never come and suffer
[51:50] again in that kind of a body. So the one
[51:53] that the people have in their im image,
[51:56] the image that they have in their mind
[51:58] is not is not the one that is raised
[52:02] from the dead because he who raised from
[52:04] the dead was never seen by them. He
[52:07] showed himself alive after his passion
[52:10] to above 500 brethren, Paul said. So
[52:14] they were the ones who saw him. They
[52:16] were the ones who gave testimony to the
[52:19] resurrection. And those who saw him on
[52:21] the shores of Galilee didn't believe he
[52:23] was raised from the dead.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; But the apostles and the disciples and
[52:28] those that were with him, they believed.
[52:30] And those that believed in their
[52:31] preaching, they believed that he was
[52:33] raised from the dead. And the gospel,
[52:36] the gospel of the book of Acts, the
[52:38] whole church was born on the message
[52:41] that he's raised from the dead. Amen.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; And the church was came into into its
[52:47] its existence on the message of the
[52:50] resurrection. And it goes out in this
[52:52] last stage on the message of the
[52:55] resurrection. And that is why a prophet
[52:57] had to come and say he is raised from
[52:59] history
[53:00] &gt;&gt; because they had him buried,
[53:03] &gt;&gt; buried in history, buried in tradition.
[53:06] And he needed to prove I'll prove to you
[53:09] tonight. He's raised from history. He's
[53:11] raised from your dead creeds and and you
[53:14] can't keep him buried any longer. And he
[53:16] brought him forth.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; And so you were united
[53:24] by your nature. Your nature, your old
[53:26] nature was your first husband. He said,
[53:28] "Now you have to be born again. You have
[53:31] to separate. You have to die to that
[53:34] first husband. You can't live with it.
[53:37] You just can't say, "Well, I'll divorce
[53:39] him and hang him up here till the
[53:41] occasion." No, sir. No writing of
[53:43] divorcement. He dies. See, the nature of
[53:47] the world has to die. Every speck of
[53:50] them has to die. You have to be reunited
[53:53] again with another nature. Notice what
[53:56] he said. He didn't say you have to be
[53:58] united again with another nature. He
[54:01] said you have to be reunited again.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. His wording is absolutely supreme.
[54:08] It's just superb. You have to be
[54:10] reunited, which means you were united at
[54:12] one time and you have to be reconnected.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You always were a Christian.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; You just experienced a disconnection.
[54:21] Now you have to be reconnected.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Separated from the old man.
[54:26] He has to die. He has to rot.
[54:31] and you're reunited
[54:33] &gt;&gt; to the nature that you always were
[54:35] intended to have.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; I'll be showing you this slide on
[54:41] Sunday, Lord willing.
[54:44] Out of the message oneness,
[54:47] he says the word oneness means
[54:51] to be one with oneness,
[54:55] united.
[54:57] And now he said this is quite a subject.
[54:59] It's going to be quite a subject tonight
[55:00] even just as we start.
[55:04] It's quite a subject and it deserves a
[55:06] lot more attention than I'm able to give
[55:09] it and more than most any person on
[55:12] earth could be able to give it. But I
[55:14] would like to express to you my opinion
[55:17] of it and with what God will give us.
[55:22] Now he said now in its teaching it in it
[55:25] is teaching doctrine. I want to
[55:27] establish that oneness. This this being
[55:32] unified with God. Brother Brandham said
[55:35] that is teaching doctrine. It's not just
[55:37] a little preaching service. Wasn't his
[55:40] message on oneness was not just an
[55:42] evangelism meeting.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; This was teaching doctrine.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; This is the doctrine that you as a
[55:50] church are founded on.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; You have to be one with God.
[55:55] It's doctrine. And to the brethren who
[55:58] may hear this tape, I trust that you
[56:00] will not be an offense. That it will not
[56:02] be an offense, but it will be to cause
[56:05] you to take this very considerably.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm only emphasizing this to
[56:11] you because you're believers, but he was
[56:14] stressing this particular doctrine, and
[56:17] he said, "Take it under consideration."
[56:20] He said, "And that you would study it
[56:22] prayerfully and carefully and weigh it
[56:26] out in the balance of God's word and see
[56:29] whether it be of God or not."
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Now he goes on in the message and I want
[56:36] this for a complete foundation. The
[56:39] first man and I spoke of our parent. See
[56:43] we
[56:44] we are where we are this evening because
[56:48] of our first parents. And the fact is
[56:50] that we are in a physical condition
[56:54] outside of the change of the body which
[56:56] is promised to us a as a rapture
[56:59] promise. A change of this body. We shall
[57:01] not all sleep but we shall all be
[57:03] changed. But outside of that we are in a
[57:06] body a mortal frame that is quickly
[57:10] vanishing.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; What is man? It what is this life? It's
[57:14] even as a vapor that appearth for a
[57:17] little while and then it vanishes. See,
[57:20] we're in that frame. The very fact that
[57:23] we're sitting here tonight in this
[57:25] mortal existence is a testimony that
[57:29] we've been disconnected from something
[57:32] &gt;&gt; and and we are to be associated or to be
[57:35] connected with something that is
[57:37] eternal. the very fact you may wonder
[57:41] about, you know, uh, eternal life or
[57:43] Satan may even come and try and make you
[57:46] question on on your spiritual, uh,
[57:50] welfare and whatever more and he likes
[57:52] to do that because he is a author of
[57:55] doubt
[57:56] &gt;&gt; and he'd like to have you doubt that.
[57:59] But let it be known to you the very fact
[58:01] that you're living in a body that's
[58:03] getting aging day by day. You're living
[58:06] in a mortal life. That if time shall go
[58:09] on, you're you're going to pass off the
[58:11] scene down here. That is evidence.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; That is evidence that that we are to be
[58:17] united with with another life. Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; It's God certainly who made a tree to
[58:25] last for may some of these trees last
[58:27] for centuries
[58:29] &gt;&gt; and the epitome of his creation last 70
[58:31] years, 80 years.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Unbelievable.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; I can't believe that.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; I can't believe that that man in the
[58:40] image of God, a tree lives longer, a
[58:42] turtle lives 300 years, a peacock lives
[58:45] for or some uh not a peacock but uh
[58:50] parrot
[58:53] live for decades
[58:55] &gt;&gt; and here we are masters of the whole
[58:57] thing and we drop over at 49 and 50 and
[59:01] on and on 60 years old
[59:04] &gt;&gt; something's not right
[59:06] &gt;&gt; that's evidence that there's another
[59:08] connection
[59:10] &gt;&gt; so now he said the first man and first
[59:12] woman in in the garden of Eden was in
[59:16] perfect harmony with God now here I want
[59:18] if you can Remember this and I will be
[59:20] showing this to you also in slide two on
[59:23] Sunday.
[59:25] They were in perfect harmony with God so
[59:28] much that God could come down
[59:33] at any time he desired and talk lip to
[59:38] ear with Adam and Eve. Now that is
[59:43] perfect oneness.
[59:46] I can tell you
[59:48] I know of one man
[59:51] &gt;&gt; in this generation
[59:53] &gt;&gt; that God could come down at any time
[59:56] &gt;&gt; and talk to him lip to earph
[1:00:03] this generation
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; and and and he says right here that is
[1:00:07] perfect oneness. Adam and Eve had that
[1:00:11] perfect oneness
[1:00:13] that was experienced. This message came
[1:00:16] to give us this to unite us
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; in this. This didn't come to give us a a
[1:00:23] better grade
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; of of religion.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Didn't come to give us just a different
[1:00:29] way to worship or you sisters a
[1:00:32] different way to dress or the men a
[1:00:34] different way to act and to speak and
[1:00:36] whatever more. The message didn't come
[1:00:38] just to give us uh church doctrine.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Didn't come for that. Just didn't come
[1:00:45] to give us a new mission. The message
[1:00:47] came and God is bringing forth one
[1:00:50] thing. The the God's purpose and his
[1:00:52] striving is to bring man back to what he
[1:00:56] lost into oneness with him.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's such a blessed place.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; It's such a blessed place for us.
[1:01:05] And he says he desired to talk. He came
[1:01:08] at any time he desired to talk lipto ear
[1:01:11] with Adam and Eve. Now that is perfect
[1:01:13] oneness. God and his creation. God
[1:01:18] speaking lipto ear with Adam and Eve.
[1:01:20] And they were so perfect in harmony with
[1:01:23] God till they were one with God.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; God and his family was one.
[1:01:36] Quote three,
[1:01:38] slide three. I'll show you.
[1:01:42] Any man in his family, a correct, good,
[1:01:49] noble, obedient family,
[1:01:53] is one with another, any family. And if
[1:01:57] there's something in that in the family
[1:02:00] that moves them apart,
[1:02:02] then it's not right. The family's broken
[1:02:06] somewhere. They should all be one.
[1:02:09] Father and mother, mother with father,
[1:02:14] children with parent, parent with
[1:02:17] children, all in agreement. And when you
[1:02:20] see that, you see one lovely picture.
[1:02:26] Do you believe that?
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; He says that's God's purpose.
[1:02:34] You just hang on. I'll preach in a few
[1:02:35] moments.
[1:02:37] And his purpose as father supreme
[1:02:41] was to be one with his family, earthly
[1:02:44] family, Adam and Eve. And the only way
[1:02:47] that they could be one with the family
[1:02:50] or with God was because God's nature was
[1:02:54] in them.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; It wasn't only that he could come and
[1:02:58] speak lip to ear with them, but that his
[1:03:01] nature was actually in them.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; That's why the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:07] Spirit is absolutely essential
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; because a person takes on the very
[1:03:13] nature of God.
[1:03:15] So that made them with God's nature in
[1:03:18] them. Then with each other and God, they
[1:03:22] became all one.
[1:03:25] He said, "Isn't that a beautiful
[1:03:27] picture? God in his family." Now I'm
[1:03:30] going slowly over these things because
[1:03:32] brother Brandham said as he was uh just
[1:03:36] entering into the subject, he said,
[1:03:38] "This deserves a lot more attention than
[1:03:41] I can give it." That's right.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; And so when you read and take these
[1:03:46] statements because he was very concise,
[1:03:49] very definitive in his in his speaking
[1:03:52] as he approaches this subject. And he
[1:03:55] said it needs it takes a lot more
[1:03:57] deserves a lot more attention than he
[1:03:59] could give it. And I can tell you this
[1:04:01] evening, it deserves a lot more
[1:04:03] attention than we're able to give it.
[1:04:05] Can you say amen? And so as we say these
[1:04:08] things and as we read these things, I
[1:04:11] want you to absorb them as much as
[1:04:12] possible. Then we will rehearse them
[1:04:14] again on Sunday morning and take it from
[1:04:17] perhaps a little bit further, a little
[1:04:19] deeper.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "God and his family, Father
[1:04:22] overall, supreme, no death, no sorrow,
[1:04:26] no heartaches, no nothing, just joy
[1:04:29] unspeakable, never to be sick, never to
[1:04:32] have a heartache, just one with God."
[1:04:34] Oh, what a picture. Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Because the very nature of God was in
[1:04:39] these people and therefore what they did
[1:04:43] they followed just in line with God and
[1:04:46] God with them made them one.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:04:54] the first thing
[1:04:56] that Satan offered Eve was something
[1:05:00] better.
[1:05:05] You know, better is not always best.
[1:05:08] It might be better, but it doesn't mean
[1:05:11] it's better.
[1:05:14] And and the offer of something better
[1:05:18] because it is within our human structure
[1:05:22] to desire to improve ourselves, to
[1:05:25] better our position, to to increase.
[1:05:29] That's part of it. We don't sew a we
[1:05:31] don't sew seeds in the garden or a
[1:05:34] farmer doesn't sew seeds in the field
[1:05:36] and he he sews 100 bushels. He doesn't
[1:05:38] want 100 bushels back. That's futility.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; We grow a garden and God believes in
[1:05:46] increase. He believes in multiplication.
[1:05:48] He swn the earth and he plans to reap a
[1:05:50] harvest.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; And that's just within us. We we we
[1:05:57] don't go into a house or even rent a
[1:06:00] little room or apartment or own a home
[1:06:02] or buy a home or whatever more.
[1:06:04] It's just not in us to go from one thing
[1:06:07] to a worse thing and a worse thing and a
[1:06:09] worse thing unless you know it just
[1:06:11] happens that way and and sometimes it is
[1:06:13] that way. But when you come back, you
[1:06:15] know, I I read my I read my
[1:06:17] grandfather's uh immigration documents
[1:06:21] when he came in 1901 on a on a ship from
[1:06:25] uh he was Austrian uh born but Ukraine
[1:06:28] in in language and so on. So he had a
[1:06:32] homestead in Saskatchewan and uh he had
[1:06:35] to report year by year because there's a
[1:06:36] homestead and as you improved it they
[1:06:39] call it improving proving up the land.
[1:06:43] So he he he he he would report on he
[1:06:48] cleared, you know, two acres and he had
[1:06:51] a pig and a cow and then the next year
[1:06:55] he had five acres and he had three pigs
[1:06:59] and four cows and two horses the next
[1:07:03] year. But it always was increasing a
[1:07:05] little bit, you know,
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; that's the way it was supposed to go.
[1:07:10] And of course when I saw him I was just
[1:07:12] a boy. I I I didn't have much of rapport
[1:07:15] with him. He I don't know whether he
[1:07:17] could speak much English or not. But
[1:07:19] anyway, uh we never had much
[1:07:21] conversation. And was he tight? Oh, was
[1:07:24] he tight? I remember getting a nickel
[1:07:27] from him once. I thought he was going to
[1:07:28] have a heart attack giving me a nickel.
[1:07:32] So when I feel a little bit like
[1:07:34] Scrooge, I know where it come from. It's
[1:07:37] in the jeans someplace.
[1:07:44] That's the way we're made. We like to
[1:07:46] increase just a wee bit from time to
[1:07:48] time, but better is not always the best.
[1:07:53] On the message uh that day at Calvary,
[1:07:58] Brother Bram says when Lucifer was given
[1:08:01] the preeminences to make his choice, he
[1:08:04] wanted something better than God. Can
[1:08:08] you imagine? Now, that's in his that is
[1:08:11] just a part of his perverted nature. You
[1:08:15] might ask, where'd he come from? I don't
[1:08:16] know. There's all kinds of questions
[1:08:17] about that that perhaps I can't answer.
[1:08:20] But he says he wanted something better
[1:08:22] than God had. And that started the
[1:08:24] trouble.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Brother
[1:08:29] uh was preaching here the other day from
[1:08:32] Ghana. Brother Aubrey Hunt. He was
[1:08:35] talking about Ahab and Nabboth
[1:08:38] and how Ahab lusted after and desired
[1:08:42] Nabboth's garden or his vineyard. And
[1:08:46] notice what he said. And brother
[1:08:47] Brandham says Ahab was the most wicked
[1:08:50] king that Israel had. And this is what
[1:08:52] he said. And Ahab said to Nabboth, "Give
[1:08:55] me thy vineyard that I may have it for a
[1:08:58] garden of herbs because it is near my
[1:09:00] house. And I will give thee for a And I
[1:09:04] will give thee for it a better vineyard
[1:09:09] than it. I'm going to give you a better
[1:09:11] one than this one.
[1:09:17] When Satan approached through the
[1:09:19] serpent
[1:09:21] Eve,
[1:09:24] he offered her something that in her
[1:09:27] eyes was better.
[1:09:29] you'll be like God.
[1:09:34] And this enticement of something better
[1:09:38] is a very subtle thing. Sometimes it's a
[1:09:41] better job. Sometimes it's a better
[1:09:44] higher education. Sometimes it's a
[1:09:46] bigger and a more beautiful church.
[1:09:48] Sometimes it's a better class of people.
[1:09:51] Sometimes it's just something that's
[1:09:52] more refined, something that's better.
[1:09:54] But it's not always good.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to get that
[1:09:59] point. And when he came and offered her,
[1:10:01] it says he said in message one, let's
[1:10:04] once again, Eve was united until she
[1:10:06] broke one word or doubted one word being
[1:10:10] true and that separated her. Now I'm
[1:10:14] going to come to a specific part of this
[1:10:16] message.
[1:10:20] And here here here we see uh Satan's
[1:10:23] design by offering her something better.
[1:10:28] He literally tore her away.
[1:10:32] Tore away from Adam's headship.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; This was not listen to me close now.
[1:10:40] This was not some little clean surgical
[1:10:45] slice that separated them. This was a
[1:10:49] brutal act
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; and ripped her away
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; from the very headship of her husband
[1:10:56] and began to dismember that family. And
[1:10:59] then the prophet said that Adam he knew
[1:11:04] whatever he knew he knew that and
[1:11:07] brother Vand said she should have been
[1:11:08] burned with a serpent.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:11:14] should have suffered the consequence
[1:11:15] because he's going to be burned.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; But Adam went in and as a part of
[1:11:20] Christ, he retrieved her quickly. He he
[1:11:24] took her to himself quickly. Do you
[1:11:26] remember me speaking about that
[1:11:28] sometime? He took her her to himself
[1:11:31] quickly. And exactly what he did, she
[1:11:35] had already been polluted, contaminated
[1:11:37] with the seed of the serpent because
[1:11:39] that was the act. And Adam took and swed
[1:11:43] his seed into her. He didn't just
[1:11:46] embrace her. He took and swed his seed
[1:11:49] into her. And he knew that God could not
[1:11:52] destroy her
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; because his life was in her.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; The serpent gave her Cain and he gave
[1:12:01] her Abel.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; And God could not destroy his own life.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; He couldn't take her life. It's as clear
[1:12:10] as can be.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Just nothing could be clearer than that.
[1:12:13] And preserved her. But he had to do it.
[1:12:17] He had to do it to act out the part of
[1:12:19] Christ.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And in and and in so doing, in saving
[1:12:25] her, he separated himself from God.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And that was precisely the part of
[1:12:32] Christ. Because when Christ came, when
[1:12:35] he finally identified himself with us
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; in flesh
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; as a sinner,
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; even though he'd never sinned, he became
[1:12:45] sin
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; for us.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, God turned his
[1:12:50] face from him and he had to cry out, "My
[1:12:54] God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; You have left me."
[1:13:02] We become disconnected.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; You have forsaken me.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; I'll give you the words later on. And
[1:13:10] and Adam was playing out exactly the
[1:13:13] same part that Christ was and it was
[1:13:16] exactly the same purpose. It was exactly
[1:13:18] the same objective. Christ went there
[1:13:20] and went through that entire exercise.
[1:13:23] It wasn't some uh clean surgical cut.
[1:13:28] This prophet says he was he he tore the
[1:13:32] soul out of him.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Wish we could see it tonight.
[1:13:43] I wish we could see it. I wish I was
[1:13:45] here on the platform and you could hear
[1:13:48] the very voice of Christ and see that
[1:13:50] body riven to the ribs with the stripes
[1:13:54] on his back and see him mutilated and
[1:13:57] see the cruel spit hanging on his face
[1:13:59] and down his beard and seeing his beard
[1:14:02] and his hairs plucked out and seeing
[1:14:05] that kind of suffering. It was not a
[1:14:07] neat little surgical slice.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; It tore the soul out of him. Amen.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; That was a an incredible act that was
[1:14:17] taking place on our behalf to take your
[1:14:20] sin and my sin. And he had to cry out,
[1:14:23] "My God, my God, why have you forsaken
[1:14:27] me? Why have you separated yourself?"
[1:14:29] Cuz God couldn't look on it any longer.
[1:14:31] He took the full penalty of your
[1:14:34] judgment, my judgment. I say, "Praise be
[1:14:37] to God and thank you, Lord Jesus."
[1:14:43] He had to do it.
[1:14:46] Adam took her quickly to himself. Christ
[1:14:48] took us quickly to himself. And if he
[1:14:51] had not, God would have destroyed us.
[1:14:56] In the message cruelty of sin, he says,
[1:14:58] "So Adam taken Eve as his wife." And
[1:15:02] then when sin came in, he said, "I have
[1:15:04] my idea of that of what that was. I
[1:15:07] don't express it out in the church
[1:15:10] unless I have having a little class uh
[1:15:14] of some sort of what the sin was in the
[1:15:17] beginning. But anyhow, when it did, it
[1:15:19] separated them from the fellowship of
[1:15:21] God. that first family. He said, "Uh,
[1:15:25] Eve
[1:15:27] should have been burned with that
[1:15:28] serpent and their awful deed, but Adam
[1:15:32] intervened, taking her to himself so
[1:15:37] that she was saved."
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; He took her to himself and she was
[1:15:43] saved. Yeah.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And in so doing, she was tore from him
[1:15:49] and he took her quickly and he was tore
[1:15:52] from God and lost fellowship and went
[1:15:54] into a world of darkness
[1:16:00] and Jesus Christ taking our sin. Now
[1:16:03] when he said, "My God, my God, why thou
[1:16:07] forsaken me?" That is a uh he was
[1:16:11] speaking actually a scripture out of
[1:16:14] Psalms 22:1. My God, my God, why hast
[1:16:17] thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far
[1:16:20] from helping me? And from the from the
[1:16:23] words of my roaring,
[1:16:27] words of my roaring. The roaring is my
[1:16:31] distress cry. My God, my God, why hast
[1:16:34] thou forsaken me? Why are you so far
[1:16:38] from helping me and from the words of my
[1:16:41] distress cry? I'm crying in my distress
[1:16:46] and you don't hear me. It wasn't a neat.
[1:16:49] It was it was a tearing
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; that was taking place. And that is in
[1:16:54] the Hebrew in the Hebrew to leave to
[1:16:58] depart. You've departed from me. You've
[1:17:00] left me. My God, my God. You've
[1:17:02] abandoned me. You've deserted me.
[1:17:05] That is what the word is.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Think of it. God could not look on his
[1:17:11] own son in the judgment that he placed
[1:17:14] upon upon our sins.
[1:17:19] In Matthew when Jesus about the ninth
[1:17:22] hour didn't say he whispered, didn't say
[1:17:26] he spoke.
[1:17:28] I'm speaking fairly clearly. But the
[1:17:31] scripture says, "And he cried with a
[1:17:34] loud voice, Eli, Eli,
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Lamus, back tonight. Why hast thou
[1:17:45] forsaken me?"
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; I love and I never tire
[1:17:53] and I trust you never tire of me ever
[1:17:56] quoting
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; these these words. Amen.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; But he says, "God
[1:18:03] confirmed the covenant with Abraham."
[1:18:06] Abraham said,
[1:18:10] "What'll you do?
[1:18:12] What'll you do for me? I only have this
[1:18:14] Eleazar. I don't have an heir. I don't
[1:18:18] have a son." In other words, there's no
[1:18:20] continuity of life here.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; I don't have a son. Nothing has come
[1:18:24] from my loins. Nothing is bone on my
[1:18:28] bone and flesh of my flesh. nothing is
[1:18:30] one with me. What will you give me that
[1:18:33] I can have a confirmation?
[1:18:36] And he told him to take the animals,
[1:18:38] take a heer, take these three animals
[1:18:41] and take a turtle but a turtle dove and
[1:18:45] uh and and these two birds.
[1:18:48] He says, "And when God confirmed the
[1:18:50] covenant with Abraham, did you notice
[1:18:52] what he did? He killed those animals
[1:18:56] and put the doves and so forth in there
[1:18:58] and there made a covenant. He did not
[1:19:01] take he he he did not take the birds
[1:19:05] apart. He did not dissect them. And
[1:19:08] brother Brandham says because they
[1:19:10] represented healing.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; There had to be something that was h an
[1:19:14] entire piece,
[1:19:17] something that was not separated because
[1:19:20] they represented healing. And the others
[1:19:23] now they were taken apart. They were cut
[1:19:27] in pieces. And he talks about in the
[1:19:30] orient
[1:19:32] in the time of Abraham when they when
[1:19:34] they made a covenant they and many of
[1:19:36] you you've heard this uh many times but
[1:19:39] I want you to hear it again in the
[1:19:40] context of this service.
[1:19:43] And they would cut the beast, slay the
[1:19:45] beast, kill it like Abraham did, and
[1:19:48] divided the ram and so forth and the she
[1:19:51] goat and whatever he divided there these
[1:19:55] animals and laid them apart. And then
[1:19:58] they would write a covenant
[1:20:00] on a piece of paper or he said would on
[1:20:04] a skin on a hide on a lambkin. They
[1:20:08] would write this covenant and make a vow
[1:20:11] to one another in a in Abraham's in
[1:20:14] Abraham and his seed. It's another
[1:20:16] message. He said it was it was in them
[1:20:19] days that the skin which they wrote on
[1:20:22] the skin now was tore apart.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; I wish I could demonstrate that for you.
[1:20:29] And one man took one piece and the other
[1:20:32] took the other piece. And then when this
[1:20:35] covenant was brought to its fullness,
[1:20:38] when this covenant was brought to its
[1:20:40] fullness,
[1:20:42] both those pieces came back together
[1:20:44] again.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; And he made it so nicely when he said,
[1:20:47] "And every every word, every letter had
[1:20:50] to fit with the next one." Word upon
[1:20:52] word and line upon line, it couldn't and
[1:20:55] nothing else. He said, you could not
[1:20:56] impersonate it with anything else. There
[1:20:59] isn't any Bible school over there that
[1:21:02] could make that piece of skin.
[1:21:05] There was no other place. There was no
[1:21:07] wise theologians or astrologers or
[1:21:10] astronomers or scientists. Nobody could
[1:21:13] make another piece of hide say, "Oh,
[1:21:15] we've developed a great we we've got a
[1:21:17] uh we can make that skin look just
[1:21:19] exactly like that and we can write words
[1:21:22] on it." But when they would bring them,
[1:21:23] they wouldn't fit.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; That's why they can have 900
[1:21:26] denominations. They can have 1,500 or as
[1:21:29] they have today 3,000 and their words
[1:21:32] won't fit with the true hide, the true
[1:21:35] skin.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; And what we're talking about is oneness,
[1:21:41] unity. And this one over here, it can't
[1:21:43] fit. You can never get to a oneness.
[1:21:46] That is why my brother, my sister, you
[1:21:47] can have a church in every corner. You
[1:21:49] can have a church in every block in the
[1:21:51] city. But only thus sayeth the Lord will
[1:21:54] fit with the original covenant.
[1:21:58] That's why that's why he stresses and in
[1:22:01] this message oneness he stresses with
[1:22:03] such emphasis and such sternness and he
[1:22:05] cries it out and screams it out. Every
[1:22:07] word, every word. Not one word can miss.
[1:22:10] You got to live by every word. Every
[1:22:12] word. Every word. And the reason he's
[1:22:14] saying is every word is because you
[1:22:16] can't have oneness with unless there's
[1:22:18] every word there.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; It has to fit.
[1:22:26] the message Israel in Egypt.
[1:22:29] You should get it. You should print this
[1:22:31] out for yourself to do your good. You
[1:22:34] ought to read it on a regular basis.
[1:22:38] And God showed Abraham
[1:22:41] because Abraham was saying, "What are
[1:22:43] you going to give me that I'll have a
[1:22:45] confirmation that I'm going to have a
[1:22:47] son?" Strange thing. And God said, "Take
[1:22:50] these animals and cut them up."
[1:22:53] You wouldn't think that that would have
[1:22:55] any any reference to his question. What
[1:22:58] are you going to do that I'm going to
[1:22:59] have a son? How will I know I'm going to
[1:23:00] have a son? Take these animals and
[1:23:02] divide them up and put the birds and
[1:23:06] don't divide them up. And he stands, he
[1:23:09] sits there amongst them and takes a
[1:23:10] switch perhaps and keeps the birds from
[1:23:13] coming on them and eating and partaking
[1:23:16] off of them. And a horror of darkness
[1:23:18] comes down. Death. And in the midst of
[1:23:22] it was a little light.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; And that light was moving through the
[1:23:26] pieces.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, with the
[1:23:30] darkness there was a light. What was
[1:23:33] God? God was saying through this entire
[1:23:35] ceremony, by this you'll know that
[1:23:38] you're going to be one. You're going to
[1:23:40] have a son come out of your own body.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:45] And when we see the darkness, when we
[1:23:48] see the sun hiding its face, when we
[1:23:51] hear the see that the earth, we have the
[1:23:53] rest of we have the record and the
[1:23:55] testimony and the earth belched and the
[1:23:58] rocks quake and the earthquake struck
[1:24:02] and and people cried out in fear and a
[1:24:05] man is crying out, Eli, Eli, Lamas back
[1:24:09] tonight, why hast thou forsaken me? and
[1:24:13] he into thy hands I commit my spirit. He
[1:24:15] hung his head and gave up the ghost. He
[1:24:18] was torn to pieces so that it would be a
[1:24:21] covenant that there was a people that
[1:24:23] would be able to come back together
[1:24:25] again.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you look back to
[1:24:30] that, that is a testimony. That is
[1:24:33] evidence that that the body you're going
[1:24:36] to be separated from, it's not the end
[1:24:38] of the road. Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; You've been united back with God through
[1:24:43] the supreme sacrifice.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; He says, "And God showed Abraham,"
[1:24:49] listen to this language. It is
[1:24:51] absolutely eloquent.
[1:24:55] God showed Abraham
[1:24:57] what he was going to do.
[1:25:00] that through the seed of Isaac, he would
[1:25:01] bring forth his only begotten son,
[1:25:04] Christ,
[1:25:06] and was slain yonder between heavens and
[1:25:09] earth.
[1:25:10] When the sun went down in the blackness
[1:25:13] over the earth, and there he tore him
[1:25:16] apart,
[1:25:19] God pulled his soul out of him,
[1:25:22] and he wrote a covenant with the
[1:25:24] families of the earth. I love that
[1:25:27] phrase.
[1:25:32] He pulled his soul out of him.
[1:25:35] This was not some delicate operation.
[1:25:38] This was not some painless thing.
[1:25:42] He tore the soul out of him. God, the
[1:25:44] creator who knows how to do things, tore
[1:25:46] the soul out of him and wrote
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; a covenant
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; with the families of the earth. Oh, I'm
[1:25:56] glad I have got that covenant. I got
[1:25:58] that evidence of that covenant.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; He says, "And when the that precious
[1:26:03] unadulterated blood of Almighty God
[1:26:06] dripping from Emanuel's veins, he tore
[1:26:09] that soul out of him and he said, "My
[1:26:11] God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[1:26:14] And his face full of mockery spit. A
[1:26:17] crown of cruel mockery pulled down over
[1:26:20] his brow, his nails drove with Roman
[1:26:23] spikes, his back riven until his ribs
[1:26:26] showed through. swinging on the cross,
[1:26:29] screaming, dying a sinner's death, the
[1:26:33] sin of the world upon him, and there God
[1:26:36] rivened his sides, tore his soul out of
[1:26:39] him, when he said, "Into thy hands I
[1:26:42] commend my spirit." And he dropped his
[1:26:44] head, and the earth shook and belched
[1:26:46] out its rocks. And there he is. There's
[1:26:49] God's covenant, the fulfilling of it.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:55] And so it was tore and the body the body
[1:26:59] went to the tomb but the spirit left him
[1:27:03] and it was the spirit. Oh I want to cut
[1:27:05] on to that on Sunday because he says
[1:27:09] that when Eve was taken out of Adam she
[1:27:11] was a byproduct
[1:27:13] something that was after the in the
[1:27:15] original creation. But when God made
[1:27:18] Eve, he took the same spirit, not
[1:27:22] another spirit, but the same spirit out
[1:27:25] of Adam, just the feminist part. It was
[1:27:28] a part of the same spirit and put it
[1:27:31] into her. And on the day of Pentecost,
[1:27:34] the pieces were coming back together
[1:27:36] again.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:41] And that is why a prophet had to come in
[1:27:44] this generation to give the original
[1:27:46] word. Thus sayaith the lord because the
[1:27:49] spirit can only come to the word.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; It can't come to what you think I think
[1:27:55] you think somebody else thinks. Some
[1:27:57] woman, some man, some church, some
[1:27:59] priest, some pope, some prespter, smart
[1:28:03] people. We all have our idea. Let me
[1:28:05] tell you. And not to be disgraceful or
[1:28:08] not to be disrespectful. Your idea means
[1:28:10] absolutely nothing to God. God doesn't
[1:28:14] come to an idea. God doesn't come to
[1:28:16] some reasoning. God comes to his word.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Only his word.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; And when the two come together, you have
[1:28:24] unity once again,
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; brought together.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; It's a oneness. That's oneness. And when
[1:28:31] oneness comes, that's when harmony
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; begins.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; That's when fellowship takes place.
[1:28:42] Mid rendering rocks and darkening skies.
[1:28:46] This poem he quotes, "My savior bowed
[1:28:48] his head and died. The opening veil
[1:28:50] revealed the way to heaven's joys
[1:28:55] and endless day."
[1:28:57] I said to you as a congregation, young
[1:28:59] people, old people, relatives,
[1:29:02] whoever you are, friends, dear ones, you
[1:29:04] can have this world if you wish, but I'm
[1:29:06] going to the next one. By his grace, I
[1:29:09] want the next one. This one's full of
[1:29:11] trouble. This one's full of darkness and
[1:29:13] chaos and sin, and I want nothing to do
[1:29:16] with it. I want to make a mark while
[1:29:19] we're here and get out of here and go
[1:29:21] out of here in a blaze of victory.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Don't count on staying here. You won't
[1:29:27] last here very long anyway.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; He says, "We know that the word death
[1:29:35] means separation. I'm only going to be
[1:29:37] another few minutes and I'm going to
[1:29:39] close. So I want to start on a I want to
[1:29:43] close on a certain note.
[1:29:46] Death means separation.
[1:29:49] You know, we've become a callous people.
[1:29:54] That's not a negative thing against you.
[1:29:56] It's due to the civilization and the
[1:30:00] society that we're in. We become we
[1:30:02] become callous. We've had to
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; to kind of protect ourselves.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; This is a harsh environment.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Separations
[1:30:16] are not painless experiences.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Separations
[1:30:22] can have horrific
[1:30:25] consequences.
[1:30:27] Absolutely horrific.
[1:30:31] I began to think of just some of them.
[1:30:32] And perhaps I have not covered near all
[1:30:34] of them. I thought of war. And when we
[1:30:37] were on this trip, every place we went
[1:30:40] to, they said, "Oh, this kingdom, this
[1:30:42] civilization, these armies and the
[1:30:44] Romans and the Ottoman Empire and the
[1:30:47] Byzantine and the Inquisition that took
[1:30:49] place and Spain and this took place and
[1:30:51] these armies went this way and those
[1:30:53] armies went that way and they
[1:30:54] slaughtered the people and burned the
[1:30:56] cities and and we were just faced with
[1:30:58] war. War. We stood on the ground knowing
[1:31:00] that the the the ground was soaked with
[1:31:02] blood
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; of men, women, families, children,
[1:31:06] babies, and the whole works.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; You read it even in the scriptures. I
[1:31:11] tell you, the earth has grown.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; And I thought of the war.
[1:31:17] This nation of Canada when it only had
[1:31:19] about 15 million during the Second World
[1:31:21] War as a population, we committed more
[1:31:25] of our young men,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. to fighting men than any nation
[1:31:30] that was in the Second World War per
[1:31:32] capita.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; As per capita,
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; over 1 million of our boys
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; were in the war, Second World War.
[1:31:42] And many of them are still over there
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; at 18 and 19 and 20 years old and
[1:31:50] Australian and British and American and
[1:31:52] whatever more. our war and we can say
[1:31:56] our boys gave their lives. That's only a
[1:31:59] small part of it. Mothers went without
[1:32:01] their sons. They were torn from the
[1:32:04] family. And even to this day comes the
[1:32:07] news comes a certain kind of a letter
[1:32:09] comes a a diplomat from from the White
[1:32:11] House or from the military executive to
[1:32:14] say, "Sorry,
[1:32:17] your son was a valiant young man. and
[1:32:19] your daughter was a wonderful young lady
[1:32:23] and gave her life and service.
[1:32:28] Tell you what, that's just the
[1:32:29] beginning.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Now it's the next year. It's the next
[1:32:33] Thanksgiving.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; It's the next Christmas and the chair is
[1:32:37] empty
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; and the heart is torn and the heart
[1:32:40] bleeds. And in the evening, in the
[1:32:42] nighttime, uh they're waiting for the
[1:32:44] sound that would be normal to that young
[1:32:47] person and the tears flow down the
[1:32:49] faces. I talked to a man here not long
[1:32:51] ago. In fact, it was just a few weeks
[1:32:53] ago.
[1:32:55] Met him just as a we were total
[1:32:57] strangers and we found out we had an
[1:33:00] acquaintance,
[1:33:02] a mutual acquaintance.
[1:33:06] And he said to me, he said, "Uh oh, I he
[1:33:09] was telling me something about his
[1:33:10] business." He said, "That was when that
[1:33:12] was when when my my son was still with
[1:33:14] me." He said, "My son was killed."
[1:33:17] And I said, "I'm very sorry to hear
[1:33:19] that." He said, "It was hard." He said,
[1:33:23] "He was absolute trouble-free
[1:33:26] young man. Worked with me in my
[1:33:27] business." He was 27.
[1:33:29] And he said it was just kind of a
[1:33:31] needless thing. He was riding a dirt
[1:33:34] bike, but he said he was not he was not
[1:33:37] an adventurist. He wasn't he wasn't that
[1:33:39] kind of a person. and he had the best
[1:33:40] equipment. Had on the best suit and the
[1:33:43] best helmet that money can buy. He just
[1:33:45] went over a little bump and and the bike
[1:33:47] slid out from under him and the back
[1:33:48] wheel came around tapped him on the
[1:33:51] head. And he said even though he had the
[1:33:53] best helmet on that you can, his brain
[1:33:56] swelled, he said, and we flew him into
[1:34:00] Royal Colombian, but in two days he was
[1:34:03] gone.
[1:34:05] He said, 'You know,
[1:34:08] everybody tried to say something, the
[1:34:10] minister, whoever they were, and I told
[1:34:11] him, I'm a pastor. Told him the church,
[1:34:14] Cloverdale Bible Way.
[1:34:19] He said, you know, ministers and friends
[1:34:21] and family, everybody tries to say
[1:34:23] something, but they don't know what to
[1:34:24] say. I said, "No, that's right. There
[1:34:26] isn't really anything you can say."
[1:34:30] He said, "Uh, I don't go to church as
[1:34:32] much as I should."
[1:34:34] He said, "Uh, when I go to church, it
[1:34:36] reminds me of my son." He said, "I'll
[1:34:40] lay home on a on a Sunday afternoon,
[1:34:42] I'll just be laying on my sofa, and for
[1:34:44] no reason at all," he says, "Tears just
[1:34:46] start streaming out of my eyes."
[1:34:49] He said, "It just comes over me with
[1:34:51] with waves. It's hard to forget." I
[1:34:53] said, "How long ago was it?" He said,
[1:34:54] "Seven years."
[1:34:57] So I began to speak to him about this me
[1:34:59] message and then I began to speak to him
[1:35:01] directly brother Brown's ministry and I
[1:35:04] was able to tell him of the a part of my
[1:35:07] testimony and seeing the girl healed
[1:35:09] blind and I just took him a church age
[1:35:11] book and one of the girls CDs so he
[1:35:14] could listen to the music.
[1:35:18] He said, "The most comfort I got was a
[1:35:22] man who was a total stranger
[1:35:24] walked into my office one day.
[1:35:28] He walked over to me
[1:35:30] and he reached out his hand and took my
[1:35:32] hand and shook it." He said, "I know
[1:35:35] what you're going through. I lost a son,
[1:35:37] too." Says he walked out. I've never
[1:35:41] seen him again. He says, "And such a
[1:35:43] peace went over me." He said, "And I got
[1:35:47] more peace from that man's visit than
[1:35:51] any person that spoke to me."
[1:35:54] And he's totally mystified by it. He
[1:35:56] doesn't know who he was. Never saw him
[1:35:59] again. And that was all there was to it.
[1:36:02] Said, "I I lost a son, too.
[1:36:10] I I'm trusting for I went and saw him
[1:36:13] again. I'm trusting for an open door. He
[1:36:16] was very moved when he heard about the
[1:36:18] ministry of today.
[1:36:22] These experiences
[1:36:24] are not pleasant. They're not easy.
[1:36:28] Listen to me close. I won't be much
[1:36:30] longer. Another five minutes.
[1:36:35] Sickness. Now, some of this is won't
[1:36:38] mean a whole lot to you, but sickness.
[1:36:41] Only the person that was robust and had
[1:36:44] their health and got up in the morning
[1:36:46] and had their breakfast and scooted off
[1:36:49] to work and went through the traffic and
[1:36:52] handled the things they knew how to
[1:36:54] conduct their business and affairs and
[1:36:55] so on and so forth and suddenly they're
[1:36:57] smitten and health is tore from them.
[1:37:01] It's not a nice little cut.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; It's not just a nice little thing that
[1:37:07] happens. It's a sudden jarring. It's an
[1:37:10] awakening. This can't happen. How does
[1:37:13] this happen? I'm perfectly healthy
[1:37:15] person. How does this happen? But it
[1:37:17] happens every day. And we we we you
[1:37:20] know, we get accustomed to it. But what
[1:37:23] I'm saying is that something is tore
[1:37:25] from that person. It's not just gently
[1:37:28] taken, but just tore away from them.
[1:37:31] I was talking to Dr. Forester not long
[1:37:33] before he passed away
[1:37:38] and I was taking a certain need to him
[1:37:42] or a certain person I should say
[1:37:48] and uh
[1:37:51] I said have you encountered this kind of
[1:37:53] thing before where a person just goes
[1:37:56] down so quickly so suddenly loses weight
[1:38:01] losses interest in life everything just
[1:38:06] just degenerates.
[1:38:08] Oh yes. No. He said this happens.
[1:38:11] There's an emotional upheaval and a
[1:38:14] shock to the system. He said I usually
[1:38:17] encountered in my practice when a
[1:38:19] husband has lost a wife or a wife have
[1:38:21] lost a husband. He says and in two weeks
[1:38:23] they just go down to skin and bones.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; He said it's such an effect upon them.
[1:38:31] You see, it wasn't just a nice little.
[1:38:34] Now, with some folks, we become callous.
[1:38:38] And there are people today, they're so
[1:38:39] fed up of their partners, and they
[1:38:41] they'd be almost happy if they The
[1:38:44] sooner you get out of my life, the
[1:38:46] better.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; You know, that's the way so many in this
[1:38:51] day are. And we we think about that.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; But that's this callous generation.
[1:38:57] The kind of home and the kind of family
[1:39:00] that God is talking about
[1:39:03] is one
[1:39:05] where that would be an excruciating
[1:39:09] painful
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; tearing.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; I think of
[1:39:15] David
[1:39:17] uh when Abselum did what he tried to do.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Tried to take the throne.
[1:39:24] tried to dethrone his own father
[1:39:27] and all the evil and get the whole
[1:39:30] kingdom and try to take it away Judas
[1:39:32] style
[1:39:34] and then finally when he's slain
[1:39:37] and his life is gone from them
[1:39:40] David expressed the heart of a real
[1:39:43] father
[1:39:45] Abselum Abselum my son Abselum
[1:39:49] that's not maybe a 21st century feeling
[1:39:54] or re response, but that was the
[1:39:56] response of a real father.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what he did, he was still
[1:40:00] my son.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; I think what alcohol does,
[1:40:11] oh, to us it doesn't hardly mean a
[1:40:15] thing. We hear it all the time. Oh, he's
[1:40:17] just a drunk. He's an alcoholic. He's a
[1:40:19] this. He's a that. But if we could only
[1:40:21] write a story of what it was uh of what
[1:40:24] the whole background was, what the scene
[1:40:27] is in behind.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Some of you have had parents or some of
[1:40:32] you have had relatives that have been
[1:40:34] alcoholic. And I'll tell you what, that
[1:40:37] not the person, nothing against the
[1:40:39] person. Some of them are just trapped
[1:40:42] into it. And that demon, and it is a
[1:40:44] demon
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; of alcohol tries to take them. and I've
[1:40:49] seen them and I've labored with them and
[1:40:51] I've worked with them and I've prayed
[1:40:53] with them and and I've seen them
[1:40:55] delivered
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; and thank God
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; for everyone that's been delivered.
[1:41:05] There's some right in this congregation
[1:41:08] been absolutely delivered from alcohol
[1:41:11] and it's a demon and the word was was
[1:41:14] ministered to the individual and they
[1:41:17] were prayed for and they were set free
[1:41:19] but that devil robs them and tears them
[1:41:22] away from their children
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; and the and and from their family and
[1:41:27] maybe from their wife or the wife from
[1:41:30] the husband and whatever more. Let me
[1:41:32] tell you, my brother, my sister, I'm not
[1:41:33] preaching for my health tonight. I'm
[1:41:35] preaching to tell you this is the truth
[1:41:36] of God's word. That's a brutal that's a
[1:41:39] brutal enemy.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; And God, how glorious it would be if
[1:41:46] that one was reunited
[1:41:48] under the banner of the gospel.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; My sister and I had a father that drank.
[1:41:56] They made their own home brew. Drank
[1:41:58] till he was unconscious. I never knew
[1:42:00] him as a drunk. I only knew him as a
[1:42:02] believer.
[1:42:04] Oh, how I thank God for the power of
[1:42:06] this word.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; I'm sure our brother Ed Nicaruk won't
[1:42:10] mind me saying out of his sadness and
[1:42:12] out of his sorrow and out of his grief,
[1:42:14] he decided to drown himself in alcohol.
[1:42:19] Because of the loss of his wife by
[1:42:21] death, I'm using this for the glory of
[1:42:24] God, brother Ed, Sister Marie, that you
[1:42:26] might
[1:42:28] allow me this. And he used to he used to
[1:42:31] drown himself with the other fellows who
[1:42:34] drank on the weekend
[1:42:37] after because he's a construction worker
[1:42:40] and they would decide where they're
[1:42:42] going to be. He got interested in Sister
[1:42:44] Marie and came to church and I thought
[1:42:47] it might disturb Sister Marie. So I did
[1:42:50] everything I could in my power to sever
[1:42:53] that whole relationship.
[1:42:55] So he came to a Wednesday night service
[1:42:57] and on that Wednesday night I played a
[1:42:59] tape
[1:43:01] and after the service was over I went
[1:43:03] and shook hands with him outside and
[1:43:05] said, "What did you think of that?" He
[1:43:07] said, "My wife had a prophet, but it was
[1:43:09] nothing like this prophet."
[1:43:12] Believer's wife was Mormon if I'm not
[1:43:14] mistaken. If I'm doing something wrong,
[1:43:16] Brother Ed, you can you must forgive me.
[1:43:21] But he said it was nothing like this
[1:43:22] prophet. And he he was given a bag of
[1:43:26] tapes. I believe Darren, was it you that
[1:43:29] gave him some tapes? Someone else? No,
[1:43:32] his brother Jim Bner gave him some
[1:43:36] tapes.
[1:43:38] And the boys had decided on the weekend
[1:43:40] they'd go down to Blaine and drink.
[1:43:43] And that's where they'd spend the
[1:43:44] weekend. He said he'd get into an
[1:43:46] absolute stuper. They hardly know one
[1:43:49] day from the next. And while he's
[1:43:51] driving down to the border, which is
[1:43:54] only six miles. While he's on his way to
[1:43:57] the border, he thinks about these tapes.
[1:43:59] He doesn't know anything about this
[1:44:01] message. He knows nothing about the
[1:44:03] prophet of God. He reaches in, takes a
[1:44:05] tape. It's a tape called the token.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God speaking of the token
[1:44:10] Jesus Christ, the token lamb of God. And
[1:44:14] he puts that he puts that message in
[1:44:16] there. He starts listening to a voice he
[1:44:18] knows nothing about a ministry he knows
[1:44:20] nothing about and he's in a certain
[1:44:23] situation and before he reaches the
[1:44:25] border he's an absolute converted soul
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; and his alcoholism left him completely
[1:44:32] before that time what did it sent his
[1:44:34] word and healed him and restored him
[1:44:38] back again
[1:44:40] and it left him brother Ed Nicaruk's
[1:44:43] been a blessing here in the church and a
[1:44:45] wonderful husband to Sister Marie and
[1:44:47] their family. What is it? It's the power
[1:44:50] of the word. Is there power in this
[1:44:52] message? Absolutely.
[1:44:54] But that would have tore away all the
[1:44:56] happiness, all the joy, all the respect,
[1:44:58] everything else. I saw it amongst the
[1:45:00] native Indian people. I tell you, talk
[1:45:03] about brutal demon that is. I had men
[1:45:07] sitting in the congregation with the
[1:45:09] glory of God shining on their face that
[1:45:11] not very long ago were crawling out in
[1:45:14] front of the same house in the mud on
[1:45:16] their hands and knees in a stuper. They
[1:45:19] didn't even know who their not their
[1:45:21] name was. One of them, his name was
[1:45:24] brother Fred something uh and got on the
[1:45:26] ferry, black ball ferry going from
[1:45:28] Victoria over to Port Angeles. He was so
[1:45:31] drunk he didn't even know when they
[1:45:33] arrived in Port Angeles he's crawling
[1:45:35] around on there and just a a laughing
[1:45:38] stalk to the people but in his soul he
[1:45:41] craved for a reality and he found God
[1:45:44] one day and was was reunited was
[1:45:47] separated from that enemy and reunited
[1:45:50] with Christ.
[1:45:52] Is this thing real? We're not here just
[1:45:55] on a Wednesday night. I'm saying this
[1:45:57] tearing this and he tore the soul out of
[1:46:00] Christ. so that we wouldn't have to
[1:46:01] experience this thing anymore.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; I say praise be to his name.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; We mentioned sickness a moment ago.
[1:46:22] I'm just five minutes over, but just
[1:46:24] give me a couple minutes. I want to
[1:46:25] close this part.
[1:46:29] Now, some of you I you don't quote this
[1:46:31] very often. You say, "Oh, God pulled
[1:46:33] this card and that was it." And that
[1:46:35] was, Brother Brand, we use this quite a
[1:46:37] few times, a premature death.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; And faith is a substance. He says, "How
[1:46:42] this demon who's come to send him to a
[1:46:45] premature grave, come out of him."
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the vibration has
[1:46:52] ceased."
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:55] Oh friends,
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; I I don't care what what day of the week
[1:46:58] this is. This has nothing to do with
[1:47:00] days of the week where we're talking
[1:47:02] about a gospel of that's alive, a gospel
[1:47:05] of power.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; We're not here wasting our time, wasting
[1:47:09] our breath. This God is real and we're
[1:47:11] talking about this isn't religion.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; This is reality.
[1:47:20] He said, "Lord, Satan's determined to
[1:47:22] send this woman to a premature grave,
[1:47:25] but Lord, I come tonight in the name of
[1:47:27] your son, Jesus Christ. Satan, turn the
[1:47:30] woman loose."
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I rebuke
[1:47:34] thee
[1:47:36] in future home. Future home is 64. He
[1:47:39] says, "There are many that are sick and
[1:47:41] needy in the land, and they haven't
[1:47:44] completed their journey. and our great
[1:47:47] enemy, not only our enemy, but your
[1:47:49] enemy, he's speaking in prayer, has come
[1:47:52] to beset them and to stop their life and
[1:47:55] to send them to a premature grave. And
[1:47:57] we're asking for them today that you and
[1:48:00] your mercy and grace, Lord, will extend
[1:48:02] their days to the allotted time. And
[1:48:04] there's people in this assembly that the
[1:48:06] same devil trying to tear out of our
[1:48:08] assembly, trying to tear out of the arms
[1:48:10] of their loved ones. And we rebuke him
[1:48:12] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:15] We don't have to lay hands on them even.
[1:48:17] We send a word, this word of life.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; What about our sister Marge Miller? In
[1:48:23] the name of Jesus, let this demon of
[1:48:26] cancer leave her.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Let her be set free. The habit that is
[1:48:32] held and holds people back. That demon
[1:48:35] of condemnation and oppression. In the
[1:48:37] name of Jesus, we rebuke him.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; And let them go free.
[1:48:44] Satan trying to tear you out of
[1:48:46] fellowship and tear you out of communion
[1:48:48] and tear you out of what is what is
[1:48:50] supposed to be rightfully yours.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; There's people we have to pray for
[1:48:54] tonight in the name of Jesus. May that
[1:48:57] demon trying to afflict them leave them
[1:48:59] now.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; You think we don't have a right to do
[1:49:03] that? Absolutely. That's what the
[1:49:05] scripture says we must do.
[1:49:12] Glory to God.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; What for? To bring you back and make you
[1:49:16] one with health make you one with
[1:49:18] Christ.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; If you're backsliden and lukewarm in
[1:49:22] your experience, may that demon that's
[1:49:25] drawn you aside, that desire and lust
[1:49:27] for the world in the name of Jesus, I
[1:49:29] rebuke him.
[1:49:31] as a minister of Christ, as a servant of
[1:49:34] Christ authorized by this word, I rebuke
[1:49:36] that devil,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; I have a right to do so and call you to
[1:49:42] come in the name of Jesus Christ and let
[1:49:44] your life be yielded to Christ for
[1:49:47] whomsoever you yield yourself to his his
[1:49:50] you are who you yield your members to.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:58] so we can be one with him.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is about
[1:50:02] tonight.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; We'll bow. Heavenly Father,
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; we're here in your service.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; We're here to do business for the
[1:50:11] kingdom of God. We're here to serve your
[1:50:13] people. And the enemy certainly is on a
[1:50:16] rampage on a as a roaring line. He would
[1:50:20] lie to the minds of of the individuals.
[1:50:23] He do everything that he can, but we
[1:50:25] have withstood him tonight. And your
[1:50:28] power breaks every feder.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, let the Holy Spirit hover
[1:50:33] over this entire congregation of people.
[1:50:36] In your name, we ask it for the glory of
[1:50:39] God that you might be glorified. Lord,
[1:50:42] it's glorious when people are delivered
[1:50:43] and healed and and saved and whatever
[1:50:45] more. But all of these things are for
[1:50:48] one purpose and that is that the name of
[1:50:50] Christ might be lifted up and glorified.
[1:50:53] Let it let the effect of this meeting
[1:50:55] continue in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:50:59] for his glory alone. We ask it humbly
[1:51:02] now Lord.
[1:51:05] We ask it humbly.
[1:51:08] Oh God.
[1:51:11] Oh God.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Your lamb Jesus Christ.
[1:51:16] He's the one that was torn.
[1:51:18] He was the one that was severed.
[1:51:21] He paid the full debt that we could be
[1:51:24] free.
[1:51:26] I wonder who needs that deliverance
[1:51:28] tonight. I wonder who needs it. You can
[1:51:31] stand to your feet now physically,
[1:51:33] emotionally, spiritually, every other
[1:51:35] way. You can stand to your feet now. And
[1:51:38] this congregation will pray and I will
[1:51:41] pray. We are going to sing Jesus breaks
[1:51:43] every feder and he sets me free. Before
[1:51:46] you stand, determined and resolve in
[1:51:48] your heart. I I'm standing with faith in
[1:51:51] my heart. There is no other word but
[1:51:53] this word that can set me free.
[1:51:58] Jesus breaks
[1:52:02] every
[1:52:08] Jesus Christ.
[1:52:19] Jesus Christ
[1:52:29] and he sets
[1:52:32] me
[1:52:35] free. Let's give him all the glory as we
[1:52:37] sing.
[1:52:39] I will shout
[1:52:45] hallelujah.
[1:52:47] Shut it in face mouth. I will shout
[1:53:05] hallelujah
[1:53:09] for he set
[1:53:13] me
[1:53:15] free
[1:53:20] for he sets
[1:53:23] me
[1:53:25] free.
[1:53:27] Once again everyone now for he set
[1:53:33] me
[1:53:36] free.
[1:53:39] Almighty God, giver of life, creator of
[1:53:43] deliverance, author of faith and author
[1:53:45] of salvation.
[1:53:47] This congregation of people and those
[1:53:50] that have stood have stood with an
[1:53:52] individual need, an individual request.
[1:53:55] And these requests are coming before you
[1:53:57] now, Lord, as incense along with
[1:54:00] worship. We are praising you for your
[1:54:02] power. We're praising you that the work
[1:54:04] is already finished. We are praising you
[1:54:08] because you're the God who has provided.
[1:54:11] Oh, more than we have need of. You're
[1:54:14] the God. You're the God of complete
[1:54:17] oneness and healing and unity and
[1:54:19] harmony. You're the God that is ordained
[1:54:22] that we should walk in such sweet
[1:54:25] sweet union with you, Lord. I pray
[1:54:28] father now that as you hear our voice
[1:54:31] and it is united together with your
[1:54:33] voice. Oh God you said that they shall
[1:54:36] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:54:38] recover. And you said in another place
[1:54:40] that we should simply speak the word.
[1:54:43] And so we speak healing. Oh God we speak
[1:54:46] deliverance. Oh God we speak we speak
[1:54:51] defeat to the enemy. We speak that he
[1:54:53] must be separated. We speak that he must
[1:54:57] be cast out. We speak that he must
[1:55:00] depart in the name of Jesus. Let that
[1:55:03] spirit of condemnation, let that
[1:55:05] sickness, let that disease leave the
[1:55:08] people. Let that condemnation, oh God,
[1:55:10] be gone. Let that doubt depart. Oh God,
[1:55:15] my sister, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:55:18] send your messenger to these homes. Send
[1:55:22] your messenger, Lord. Deliver my brother
[1:55:25] out of that bed, oh God of affliction
[1:55:27] and infirmity, and set him on his feet
[1:55:31] rejoicing.
[1:55:33] We will give you praise and glory.
[1:55:37] A lot of people won't thank you, but we
[1:55:39] will thank you. We will glorify your
[1:55:42] name.
[1:55:43] Oh, bless the Lord. Oh, bless you. And
[1:55:47] all that is within me. Bless your holy
[1:55:49] name. Oh Jesus, you're ministering to
[1:55:52] us. You're ministering to us, Lord. Oh,
[1:55:56] you're ministering to us. How we love
[1:55:57] you. How we thank you. How we thank you
[1:56:00] for these people, Lord. Open with open
[1:56:03] face, looking into your word as you
[1:56:05] reveal yourself to them from glory to
[1:56:07] glory that they might come into your
[1:56:08] very image and likeness.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Strengthen us and be with us
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Let's all everyone stand to our feet.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Matthew, would you
[1:56:26] like to bring
[1:56:28] Sister Hannah? I wonder, brother Lance,
[1:56:30] if you would come, please.
[1:56:36] Hallelujah.
[1:56:40] Jesus breaks.
[1:56:51] Jesus praise
[1:56:55] every
[1:57:02] Jesus Christ.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; And he sets
[1:57:27] meal.
[1:57:38] All things are possible
[1:57:44] for
[1:57:46] me.
[1:57:50] Holy.
[1:58:02] All things are possible.
[1:58:12] Holy
[1:58:24] believe.
[1:58:27] All things are possible
[1:58:33] for we
[1:58:36] believe.
[1:58:45] All
[1:58:52] things are
[1:58:57] all
[1:59:00] I receive.
[1:59:02] Oh Lord,
[1:59:05] I receive.
[1:59:09] Lord
[1:59:11] I receive
[1:59:15] that and all things are
[1:59:21] Lord I
[1:59:23] receive.
[1:59:27] Lord
[1:59:29] I receive.
[1:59:33] Lord
[1:59:35] I receive.
[1:59:39] All things are possible.
[1:59:45] Lord, I
[1:59:48] Lord I believe.
[1:59:51] Lord,
[1:59:53] I believe.
[1:59:57] Lord,
[1:59:59] I believe
[2:00:02] that all things are possible.
[2:00:09] Lord, I
[2:00:12] believe.
[2:00:15] Lord,
[2:00:17] I believe.
[2:00:21] For
[2:00:23] I believe
[2:00:27] all things are possible,
[2:00:32] Lord. I really
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; I wonder if there's someone who's been
[2:00:44] struggling, who've been bound.
[2:00:47] You have not been able to get free.
[2:00:50] You've tried church. You've tried this.
[2:00:52] Maybe you've tried this church. You've
[2:00:54] tried to read the Bible. You've tried to
[2:00:56] read a message. You've tried this.
[2:00:58] You've tried that. But there have been
[2:01:00] no deliverance. And somehow tonight you
[2:01:03] feel it's over. You feel that God, you
[2:01:06] don't have to come forward. You can do
[2:01:08] it right where you're at. But if you
[2:01:10] feel you need prayer, we'll be happy to
[2:01:12] pray for you. I want to tell I want to
[2:01:13] say something because a lot of people
[2:01:15] say, "I want to be healed because I need
[2:01:17] to come back to good health, etc."
[2:01:18] That's wonderful. I need to be delivered
[2:01:20] so I can live h a a the kind of life, a
[2:01:23] fruitful life, a life that's a delight
[2:01:26] to the Lord. That's all good. But when
[2:01:28] the blind man in in the Gospel of John,
[2:01:30] his disciples had a question and they
[2:01:32] said to Jesus, "Who hath sinned?
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; This man or his parents?" Jesus said,
[2:01:37] "Neither, not his parents and not him,
[2:01:41] but this has been done so that the God
[2:01:44] will be glorified."
[2:01:46] Sometime we feel I'm sick. I did
[2:01:48] something wrong. What did I do wrong? Uh
[2:01:51] uh something's happened. Uh maybe God is
[2:01:53] uh uh God is punishing me. No, think
[2:01:57] about that blind man. Maybe had a wife.
[2:01:59] Maybe had children. I don't know. Think
[2:02:01] about what he went through. Never
[2:02:02] perhaps saw a flower in all of his life.
[2:02:04] Never saw the beauty of life. Never saw
[2:02:06] a child's face. And God allowed him to
[2:02:09] go through that. You don't understand
[2:02:10] that kind of a God. Neither do I. But
[2:02:13] God allowed that so that this moment
[2:02:15] could come and he could give glory to
[2:02:17] God. and he was made perfectly whole.
[2:02:20] Maybe that's your m maybe that's your
[2:02:22] moment. Maybe this is that moment. And
[2:02:24] if it is, we'll be happy to pray with
[2:02:26] you. I want Sister Calder, Sister Jenna,
[2:02:32] Jessica, I would like you to come. Come,
[2:02:34] please. I wonder if there's anyone.
[2:02:36] Let's sing it once again and maybe
[2:02:38] someone else.
[2:02:39] This is the atmosphere. Yes, sir.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Why do why do these things happen? We
[2:02:45] don't know. But we know one thing. God
[2:02:48] delivers people that his name may be
[2:02:51] glorified.
[2:02:53] It's not so we can even be well. It's so
[2:02:55] that he can be glorified. And the fact
[2:02:57] that you're made well is only a side
[2:02:59] benefit.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; The fact you're delivered is only a side
[2:03:03] benefit. That's why a lot of people
[2:03:05] aren't delivered say, "I want to be
[2:03:07] delivered. I want to do this. I, you
[2:03:08] know, I need to I need to be happy
[2:03:10] again." That's not the point. The point
[2:03:12] is that God can be glorified so you can
[2:03:15] go through the rest of your life and
[2:03:16] say, "He delivered me.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he delivered me. I'm so glad
[2:03:23] he set me free. Oh, I could rejoice
[2:03:26] tonight and do a dance. He set me free
[2:03:29] as he's done that for you.
[2:03:32] Hallelujah.
[2:03:33] Glory to God.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Now I receive." Heavenly Father,
[2:03:39] say and pray with us as you would.
[2:03:41] there's someone else that really is in
[2:03:43] that particular state, you come. We got
[2:03:45] brethren, we got ministers, we got
[2:03:47] deacons, we got men of faith.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; We got a people of faith here, friends.
[2:03:52] We got people here who are accustomed to
[2:03:54] miracles.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; We've seen all kinds of them.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; And I say we shouldn't let down the
[2:03:59] bars. We should say, "Oh God, let us be
[2:04:02] a let us be a devastation to the kingdom
[2:04:05] of darkness and Satan in the name of
[2:04:07] Jesus Christ." I believe in preaching
[2:04:09] and power. And the prophet said,
[2:04:11] "Preaching is demonstrating the gospel."
[2:04:14] I'm preaching tonight that the gospel
[2:04:16] may be demonstrated. May these who are
[2:04:18] prayed for walk out of here absolutely
[2:04:20] healed.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:04:31] I receive.
[2:04:35] Lord,
[2:04:37] I receive.
[2:04:41] All things are possible.
[2:04:47] Lord, I
[2:04:49] receive.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:04:54] I receive.
[2:04:58] Lord,
[2:05:00] I receive.
[2:05:04] All things are possible.
[2:05:09] Oh Lord I receive.
[2:05:14] Yes Lord
[2:05:17] I receive.
[2:05:20] Oh Lord
[2:05:22] I receive.
[2:05:26] All things are possible.
[2:05:32] Lord I receive.
[2:05:37] Yes Lord

[2:06:12] all things.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Praise your name.

[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:06:32] I receive.
[2:06:36] All things are possible.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. For I
[2:06:44] receive only believe now
[2:06:53] just
[2:06:59] that all things
[2:07:02] are
[2:07:05] Just all
[2:07:11] just
[2:07:23] all things are possible.

[2:12:56] became me

[2:21:54] When Jesus
[2:21:56] comes,
[2:21:59] the temptor's
[2:22:01] power is proclaimed.
[2:22:06] When Jesus
[2:22:08] comes,
[2:22:11] the tears are the way.
[2:22:16] Listen now. He takes the glue
[2:22:22] and fills the night with glory.
[2:22:29] For all is change
[2:22:34] when Jesus comes to
[2:22:40] listen now. One side alone
[2:22:45] beside
[2:22:47] the highway.
[2:22:52] His eyes were blind,
[2:22:57] but the light he could not see.
[2:23:03] He lost his breath
[2:23:08] and shivered in the shadow.
[2:23:13] But this changed death. Then Jesus
[2:23:16] came
[2:23:19] and saved his
[2:23:22] flee.
[2:23:25] When Jesus
[2:23:28] comes,
[2:23:30] the tender
[2:23:33] is broken.
[2:23:37] Oh, when Jesus
[2:23:39] comes,
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; where's the word?
[2:23:43] our cry away.
[2:23:48] He takes the world
[2:23:53] and it fills my life with glory
[2:24:00] for all
[2:24:04] when Jesus
[2:24:06] comes.

[2:24:19] Requests and we have come to you asking,
[2:24:25] beseeching you.
[2:24:27] For there is none other that can answer.
[2:24:31] There's no other that can do these
[2:24:33] things. And we identify you as the
[2:24:36] living Christ, the bleeding word of this
[2:24:39] day, the one who has come and walked
[2:24:40] amongst us. We believe that you are
[2:24:43] indeed here not in song and not only in
[2:24:47] word but in manifestation. You are here
[2:24:50] to manifest yourself and we are here
[2:24:52] Lord to open our mouths and to give
[2:24:54] glory to you.

[2:24:58] created and sent to the world at such a
[2:25:00] time as this to give you praise and
[2:25:02] glory. And may this congregation feel
[2:25:05] that as a solemn commission. I have been
[2:25:07] here to praise and glorify my Lord. I
[2:25:11] pray that they will go from this place
[2:25:13] with praise on their lips. Oh God of
[2:25:15] glory to the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:25:18] the great things that you have done and
[2:25:19] you are doing and will do.

[2:25:24] and may you give a special blessing to
[2:25:26] the people protection along the roads
[2:25:29] and in the parking lot and the children
[2:25:31] and keep them in good health. I pray
[2:25:33] help them in their schoolwork tomorrow
[2:25:35] Lord. Every man, every woman that has
[2:25:38] duties, I pray that you will give them
[2:25:40] the strength, the wisdom of the Holy
[2:25:42] Spirit and the energy, oh God. And may
[2:25:45] their witness be an un undying flame in
[2:25:49] this dark end time. Send us from your

[2:26:00] your patience. Thank you for your
[2:26:02] prayers and may you may you go in with
[2:26:05] uh uh a great feeling of of fulfillment.

[2:26:18] Christ.
