[0:03] One by one
[0:06] they chose to die
[0:10] the son of God.
[0:14] They would not deny
[0:18] that like a great
[0:20] angelic
[0:23] wise.
[0:27] I can almost hear
[0:31] their voicees
[0:33] ring. I pledge alle
[0:43] with all my strength
[0:47] and with all I am. I will seek
[0:54] to honor
[0:56] his
[0:58] commands.
[1:00] I pledge
[1:02] allegiance
[1:05] to
[1:08] the land. Now the years have come.
[1:13] Now the years have come
[1:17] and the years have gone.
[1:21] But the cause of Jesus
[1:26] still goes on.
[1:29] And now our time has come
[1:34] to count the cost,
[1:38] to reject this world,
[1:42] to embrace
[1:44] the cross.
[1:46] For one by one,
[1:50] let us live our lives.
[1:54] For the one who died
[1:58] to give us life
[2:02] till the trumpet
[2:04] sounds
[2:06] on that final
[2:09] day.
[2:11] Let us proud he stand
[2:15] and oh
[2:17] say that I pledge
[2:22] allegiance
[2:23] to
[2:25] the land.
[2:28] With all my strength,
[2:32] with all I am, I will seek
[2:38] to honor
[2:40] his
[2:42] command.
[2:44] I pledge
[2:46] alce
[2:49] to
[2:52] the lamb to the lamb of God.
[2:56] To the
[2:58] one
[3:01] who bore my pain,
[3:05] who took my place
[3:09] in all my shame
[3:13] and seek
[3:15] to honor
[3:17] the king's
[3:19] command.
[3:21] I pledge
[3:24] alceence
[3:26] to
[3:28] the
[3:31] land.
[3:34] The journey that we travel is a winding
[3:40] narrow road.
[3:44] And there are times we stumble or
[3:46] contained
[3:48] a heavy
[3:50] load.
[3:53] Always there's a voice to tell you
[3:57] you'll never make it in.
[4:01] Reminding you of all your failures and
[4:06] longforgotten sin. 1097.
[4:10] You know within your heart God's blood
[4:14] has washed you white as snow.
[4:18] Still in your mind the battle rages and
[4:24] redens all. Amen. But even if you're
[4:26] pushed but even if you're pushed beyond
[4:30] where you feel you feel you can stand.
[4:34] Just remember you can put your faith.
[4:37] You can put in God's unfailing hand.
[4:41] Unfailing
[4:43] hand. You may bend. You may be.
[4:49] But you won't break.
[4:53] And you may stumble
[4:58] and even feel you've lost your way. But
[5:02] you won't fall.
[5:06] Cause
[5:08] remains.
[5:10] You won't be bound.
[5:14] My broken chains,
[5:18] you can be bound.
[5:23] My broken. Amen. Sing the next verse if
[5:26] you know him. Even though and even
[5:29] though a thousand storms may rage
[5:33] against your life, you will find a
[5:36] resting place. Will find a resting place
[5:40] within the arms of Christ.
[5:43] Hallelujah. We've risen far beyond.
[5:45] We've risen far beyond the realms of
[5:49] lying circumstance.
[5:53] when nothing formed against this bride
[5:58] will ever stand a chance. Now you don't
[6:01] have to listen. Now you don't have to
[6:04] listen when that voice says you. Amen.
[6:08] For God's ordained that you and I. For
[6:11] God's ordained that you and I should
[6:14] walk in liberty. Hallelujah. Amen.
[6:17] Freedom's been proclaimed. Freedom's
[6:20] been proclaimed to all the captive at
[6:24] the bound. And in Jesus name. Amen. You
[6:28] can hear those chains
[6:31] fall broken to the ground. Fall broken
[6:35] to the ground. Oh, fall broken to the
[6:41] ground.
[6:43] You may be
[6:47] but you won't break
[6:51] and you may stumble.
[6:55] Oh, and even feel you lost your way, but
[6:59] you won't fall.
[7:03] God's word
[7:05] remains.
[7:07] You won't be bound.
[7:11] My broken chains
[7:15] you can't be bound
[7:19] by broken chasing the course again. You
[7:23] may bend. You may bend,
[7:28] but you won't break.
[7:32] And you may stumble.
[7:36] Oh, and even feel you've lost your way.
[7:52] My broken chains
[7:56] you can be found.
[8:02] One more time. Broken chains. Oh, you
[8:05] baby,
[8:09] but you
[8:13] and you may stumble.
[8:17] Oh, and even
[8:19] you lost your way, but you won't fall.
[8:25] God's word, I know his word made you
[8:30] found.
[8:33] My broken chains,
[8:37] you can't be bound.
[8:42] My broken chains.
[8:46] Hallelujah. You're a free people this
[8:48] evening. Amen. God bless you, saints.
[8:51] Welcome to the service tonight. Amen. We
[8:54] just have a very full evening tonight.
[8:57] Many of the specials that wanted to be
[8:59] sung and we'll just get to those that we
[9:00] can. And I trust that you'll forgive us
[9:02] if we don't call you this evening. And
[9:04] why don't you stand with me, we're going
[9:06] to turn the pulpit to our pastor.
[9:09] Amen. And just before we do that, I'd
[9:10] like to sing together, fill my cup,
[9:12] Lord. We're going to take the offering a
[9:14] little bit later, so we'll just hold off
[9:15] on that for now. Amen. But I just wanted
[9:18] to sing sing an old song of prayer and
[9:20] consecration. It's my desire tonight
[9:22] that the Lord would fill my cup once
[9:24] again. We know the prophet told us that
[9:25] if there's a desire in your heart for
[9:27] more of God, then there's more of God
[9:29] for you to have. Amen. I just want
[9:31] another drink from the fountain tonight.
[9:33] Amen. Let's sing this together as our
[9:35] pastor would come then. Oh, fill my cup,
[9:40] Lord,
[9:43] for I lift it up,
[9:47] Lord.
[9:50] Oh, come and quench,
[9:55] quench this thirsting of my soul.
[10:04] Oh bread of heaven,
[10:09] just feed me till I want
[10:14] no more. Here's
[10:18] my cup.
[10:21] Fill it up and make me whole. Once
[10:27] again, let's just ask it in a prayer
[10:28] now. Oh, fill my cup,
[10:34] Lord,
[10:36] for I lift it up.
[10:41] Lord,
[10:44] please come and quench.
[10:48] Quench this thirsting
[10:51] of my soul.
[10:57] Oh bread of heaven.
[11:03] Feed me till I want
[11:08] no
[11:10] more.
[11:11] Here's my cup.
[11:15] Fill it up and make me.
[11:26] The words of that course
[11:29] very much express what was in my heart
[11:32] last night. I was impacted
[11:35] by the word.
[11:37] In fact is I said to my wife, we'll go
[11:41] home tomorrow.
[11:43] I didn't tell her why, but I just wanted
[11:45] to be alone. I just wanted to think
[11:47] about the service last night. And after
[11:51] the activities of the day, I was
[11:54] concerned that some of you young people
[11:56] or a lot of you may be so tired and
[11:59] wearied and you be sleepy during the
[12:03] service. But I I want to compliment you.
[12:06] You were so
[12:08] &gt;&gt; aware, so alert,
[12:11] so eager, so pulling on the word. And
[12:15] our brother Ron Spencer was certainly
[12:20] inspired by the Holy Ghost and spoke to
[12:24] many many hearts.
[12:26] I just uh looked at the
[12:30] uh number of you that were here filling
[12:33] the whole front of the service and I I
[12:37] was thanking God
[12:39] &gt;&gt; that others
[12:41] were spoken to. I saw one stand over
[12:45] here, then another one, then one over
[12:47] here, and someone over here. And
[12:50] finally,
[12:51] many of you, if not all, were standing.
[12:55] And I want to say the music continues.
[12:59] &gt;&gt; Doesn't make any difference what
[13:02] happens.
[13:03] And uh last night while brother Spencer
[13:07] I believe was praying just at the at the
[13:11] reading of the word and
[13:15] began to
[13:17] uh pray for
[13:20] brother Ken Ber in Calgary.
[13:25] And brother Ken Ber has had a
[13:29] a tumor on his
[13:32] uh on his face or on his brain
[13:37] and he was very very ill, very sick and
[13:41] in his bed in the bed and he was very
[13:45] very sick. Brother Ken Boyer's
[13:49] father-in-law and mother-in-law are here
[13:51] tonight.
[13:53] Brother Meadow Fzen, pastor in
[13:56] Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
[13:59] Brother Meadow, we're going to ask you
[14:01] if you'd come up and and offer prayer
[14:04] and also thanksgiving.
[14:06] We have some prayer requests here. I'd
[14:09] like you to pray for this service. Pray
[14:12] that God
[14:15] uh will come and meet you individually.
[14:18] We prayed for brother Ken Ber last
[14:20] night.
[14:22] Brother Fzen tells me he was up walking
[14:25] today
[14:27] and uh has he gone home?
[14:31] &gt;&gt; He's home.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; He's home.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; He never left home.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; We just pray that God will continue. All
[14:38] things are possible.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; A deacon is here, Brother Gindo. Emanuel
[14:44] Gindo,
[14:46] he
[14:47] sent me an email not just a few weeks
[14:51] ago
[14:53] and he said, "My wife has been confirmed
[14:56] to have leukemia.
[14:59] I wish to bring her up to the front of
[15:02] the church and have you, brethren, pray
[15:04] for her."
[15:07] And just a few weeks ago, we prayed for
[15:10] sister Francine Gindo.
[15:13] It was her Sharon was her daughter is
[15:15] his daughter that sang also on night
[15:19] before last. But let me tell you
[15:22] friends, this is not just a ceremony.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; This is not something that brother Gindo
[15:29] had to do, but he wanted to do it. It
[15:33] was in his heart to do it. the God of
[15:36] this message is a living God to him
[15:39] &gt;&gt; and to his wife. And so they brought her
[15:42] up and went back to the same doctor and
[15:45] they cannot find a trace of leukemia in
[15:49] her blood. I can tell you friends, we're
[15:53] a very happy group of people and I
[15:57] personally am very happy. I'm happy for
[16:00] the Gindo family. I must say that
[16:03] perhaps I don't have the same level of
[16:06] faith as they had. But they said, he
[16:10] said, I want to bring her up and she'll
[16:12] be delivered from this. And I was trying
[16:15] to give the testimony tonight. And he
[16:18] said, that's what we did. There's
[16:19] nothing. There's no trace of it. I say,
[16:22] praise be to God.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; And that God, I believe, will speak
[16:26] through our brother, our brother Ron
[16:29] Spencer tonight. And I believe he'll
[16:31] speak directly to your heart and
[16:34] directly to your cry. And if we are
[16:37] calling out to God and I must say, I am
[16:42] I'm calling out to God for specific
[16:45] things and say, "Oh God, if you'll just
[16:48] do this for me, I will be so thankful.
[16:52] I'm glad for the servant of God. I'm
[16:56] glad for the message of the hour." And
[16:59] for those of you that have played the
[17:01] original
[17:03] uh believers when they sang as believers
[17:06] and cut several records, our brother Ben
[17:09] Freezen is one of the that were singing.
[17:12] But I can tell you he's still singing
[17:14] another song in spite of the sickness of
[17:18] his son-in-law and the answer of God to
[17:22] the need of that prayer. I don't know
[17:24] how many people are praying. I'm sure
[17:27] they're praying from all over the world,
[17:29] but tonight, Brother Fzen, we're happy
[17:33] and thankful that you're here. Please,
[17:35] if you'll just pray for us.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; We're glad to be here.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Pardon?
[17:39] &gt;&gt; We're glad to be here.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Fzen says he's happy to be here.
[17:45] God bless you. We're happy to have you.
[17:48] Thank you for your
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much. And thank
[17:52] you so much for praying for Brother Ken.
[17:54] Uh just got a text today. They've been
[17:57] keeping us posted and um uh he was up
[18:02] and went downstairs and he was uh he's
[18:06] one of those uh gentlemen that has a
[18:09] real strong bull faith. He kind of took
[18:12] the approach that Esther took when she
[18:16] went before the king. She said, "If I
[18:17] perish, I perish,
[18:20] but I will not I will do my duty." and
[18:23] Ken's that way is strong and I thank you
[18:25] so much for your prayers and around the
[18:28] world people have been praying but above
[18:30] all I thank the Lord for hearing the
[18:31] prayer

[18:34] humble

[19:03] and define it. The waters
[19:08] in the desert
[19:11] turns the night
[19:14] to golden day.
[19:19] And I know,
[19:22] yes, I know
[19:25] that Jesus blood can make the vilest
[19:29] sinner clean
[19:33] and I know.
[19:37] Yes, I know.
[19:40] Jesus blood made the vile sinners
[19:47] and in temptation
[19:51] he is near thee

[19:59] hell
[20:02] leads me to
[20:06] the past
[20:09] and he gives gives me grace
[20:13] for every day.

[20:54] words.

[21:00] &gt;&gt; I am the word and my word can never
[21:02] change. Heaven and earth will pass away,
[21:03] but my word will never pass away. It
[21:06] will accomplish that which I send it
[21:08] for. Lord, how thankful we are tonight
[21:10] to be in this kind of an atmosphere
[21:13] where your spirit is present, where
[21:15] you're here to hear the slightest
[21:17] murmur.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; They might not be able to speak it, but
[21:20] you already know what lays in their
[21:21] heart. Father, we thank you for your
[21:23] healing virtue, but above all, we thank
[21:25] you for redeeming us. For the covenant
[21:27] is the same. Whether to take up thy bed
[21:30] and walk or thy sins be forgiven thee.
[21:32] They are the same covenant and we are
[21:35] forgiven. We thank you so much. But more

[25:09] Some folks I know by their name. Some I
[25:14] just know their face.
[25:17] Some are known by their fame. Others are
[25:22] known by their race.
[25:26] But in the kingdom of our Lord, each
[25:31] soul has its place.
[25:34] And in my mind, I have no doubt by name.
[25:40] I've been called out.
[25:44] And we've been called out
[25:48] for a purpose. Called out to be a
[25:52] servant. Call out to live the standard.
[25:57] He called you out to raise the better.
[26:02] Call out to be a witness. Called out to
[26:09] show forgiveness. Call out from the
[26:14] world. child. You've been called out
[26:21] within the prison walls. That day, the
[26:25] jailers bound up their feet,
[26:29] stripped off their garments. There they
[26:32] lay, bleeding from where they were be.
[26:37] Then along about midnight, Paul began to
[26:41] pray. Silence started to sing.
[26:46] The earth shook all about the door swung
[26:49] open wide.
[26:51] Been called out
[26:55] and we've been called out
[26:59] for a purpose. Called out to be served.
[27:04] Been called out to the standard. We
[27:09] called you out to raise the better. Call
[27:14] out to be a witness. Called out to show
[27:20] forgiveness. He called us out from the
[27:25] world. Child, you've been called out
[27:30] cuz we've been called out
[27:34] for a purpose. called out to be a
[27:39] servant. Called out to live the
[27:43] standard. He called you out to raise a
[27:48] better call out to heal witness. Call
[27:54] out
[27:55] to show forgiveness. Call down from the
[28:00] world. Child, you've been called out.
[28:06] You've been called
[28:08] out from the world. Child, you've been
[28:13] called out.

[28:31] moment. We're going to invite the
[28:32] brothers to come. Take the morning or
[28:34] the evening offering, excuse me. And
[28:37] we're going to turn the service to our
[28:38] brother Tim.
[28:41] And why don't just play bless the Lord,
[28:43] oh my soul, and all that is within me.
[28:44] Bless his holy name, Eflat. We did have
[28:47] a prayer request that I didn't get to
[28:48] earlier. I beg your pardon. We is a
[28:51] request that we please pray for brother
[28:52] Paul Neighbor as he had had eye surgery
[28:54] yesterday and she's asking for a healing
[28:57] touch from the Lord and that God be with
[28:59] him as he recovers. And have you been
[29:02] blessed so far in the meeting, saints?
[29:04] Amen. I trust that God blesses you in
[29:07] your giving tonight and continues to
[29:08] minister to you. Just as we turn the
[29:10] service to our brother Tim, let's just
[29:12] sing this chorus together. Bless the
[29:13] Lord, oh my soul, for he has done great
[29:15] things.
[29:17] Oh, bless the Lord,
[29:21] oh my soul, and all
[29:26] that is within me, bless his holy,
[29:34] bless his holy name. Once again, bless
[29:39] the Lord. Oh, bless the Lord,
[29:44] oh my soul and all
[29:48] that is within me. Bless his holy,
[29:56] bless his holy name, for he has done
[29:59] great things. Oh, for he has done great
[30:05] things.
[30:07] For he has done great things.
[30:12] For he has done great things. Bless his
[30:18] holy
[30:20] name.
[30:26] Amen. And has he done great things?
[30:29] &gt;&gt; What a tremendous camp meeting we are
[30:31] having. It's hard to believe we're
[30:33] already here on Saturday night.
[30:36] We want to take up an offering. The we
[30:38] took an offering last night for the
[30:40] ministry and show our appreciation for
[30:42] the ministry. But you can't have a
[30:44] meeting like this. You know, we may
[30:46] charge fees for food and for
[30:48] accommodation,
[30:50] but you can't have a tent and equipment
[30:51] like this without renting it and
[30:53] supplying it and everything. And there's
[30:54] all kinds of expenses to go with it. But
[30:57] I'll go further. Brother Brham says you
[30:59] can't have a meeting without giving the
[31:02] people an opportunity to give towards
[31:04] the meeting.
[31:05] that's a part of our worship. And uh he
[31:08] said, "I tried to do that one time. I
[31:10] tried to have somebody sponsor the whole
[31:12] thing and no offering was taken." He
[31:14] said, "It was the most failure of the
[31:15] meeting that I ever had because there's
[31:18] something in it that the people have to
[31:20] give towards it." And so we want to do
[31:23] that tonight. We want to give our
[31:25] offering as a form of worship towards
[31:26] the expenses of these meetings. And we
[31:29] also want to give as worship unto the
[31:32] Lord. So, let's bow our heads together
[31:34] as we commit this to the Lord and
[31:35] remember this prayer request tonight.
[31:39] Wonderful heavenly father,
[31:42] Lord, there's none like you, oh God, and
[31:44] we could just spend the rest of the
[31:48] evening just thanking you for what you
[31:50] have already done. So many great things
[31:55] individually that you have moved amongst
[31:57] the people. You have touched my heart. I
[32:00] know. And Lord, you know how you've
[32:02] dealt with me. And Lord, I know that
[32:05] there's many in hearing their
[32:06] testimonies, how you've dealt with them,
[32:09] things that have been restored, people
[32:11] that have been healed, lives that have
[32:14] been delivered from the hand of the
[32:15] enemy. And we give you praise and honor
[32:18] and glory for that. And Lord, we want
[32:21] you to continue tonight. We want you to
[32:23] take the preeminence once more. Take
[32:25] Brother Ron into your hands. Lord, may
[32:28] you glorify yourself through the vessel
[32:32] that has been anointed to take this
[32:34] service tonight. We want to yield
[32:36] ourselves. And Lord, we're remembering
[32:38] our brother Paul Neighbor tonight as the
[32:40] request has come in. He's had some
[32:42] surgery on his eyes and he needs Lord a
[32:45] healing touch from you. A doctor can
[32:47] operate, but there's only one healer and
[32:49] that's the Lord Jesus Christ. And we ask
[32:52] Lord that your healing virtue that was
[32:54] loosed at Calvary would come to our
[32:56] brother Paul even right now. Lord Jesus,
[32:59] may he sense your hand upon his life and
[33:02] every other need that's represented
[33:03] here. Lord, may you meet each need. And
[33:06] Father, as we give what we can give, we
[33:10] ask, Lord, that you'll take our
[33:11] offering. We lift it unto you as a form
[33:14] of worship. And we pray, Lord, that it
[33:16] would be pleasing in your sight. And may
[33:19] you use it for your glory. and may you
[33:21] bless all of the labors that have gone
[33:24] into these meetings. We love you, Lord,
[33:27] and we commit it to you in Jesus
[33:29] Christ's name. Amen.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats as we take
[33:37] up the offering. Let's continue to sing
[33:39] that together. And just before we turn
[33:41] the pulpit to our brother Ron, I'm going
[33:42] to ask for brother Seriel to come and
[33:44] prepare to sing for us, please. Bless
[33:47] the Lord. Amen.
[33:49] Oh, bless the Lord,
[33:53] oh my soul,
[33:55] and all that is within me. Bless his
[34:01] holy,
[34:05] bless his holy name. Bless the Lord once
[34:09] again. Oh, bless the Lord,
[34:15] oh my soul,
[34:18] and all that is within me. Bless his
[34:23] holy
[34:26] name. Bless his holy name. For he has
[34:30] done great things. I know that he has
[34:35] done great things.
[34:39] He has done great things.
[34:44] He has done great things. Bless his holy
[34:52] name.
[34:56] Amen. We did have one announcement from
[34:59] brother Matthew Redell. Starting on
[35:00] Monday, October 13th to Saturday, August
[35:03] 18th, the Lynen Fair witness and
[35:05] outreach booth will be set up and open
[35:07] to all who are convinced of the
[35:08] wonderful gospel and end time message
[35:10] and concerned for all those who need the
[35:12] Lord. So, please contact Brother Matthew
[35:13] for additional details and days and
[35:15] shifts you you would like to be
[35:16] available.
[35:18] Amen. We always look forward to that
[35:20] time. We'll be remembering those who
[35:21] will be serving at the booth. Come,
[35:23] brother Sarah. And then afterwards, we
[35:25] will turn the pulpit to our brother Ron.
[35:56] Are you
[36:01] for
[36:10] the
[36:14] and me the be
[36:21] love when
[36:36] you

[39:04] Oh,

[39:15] be
[39:29] loose.
[39:35] pre.
[40:04] Disreg.
[40:29] Amen. Can we sing that chorus together
[40:30] as our brother Ron comes? I claim the
[40:32] blood.
[40:34] I claim the blood
[40:38] Jesus shed on Calary.
[40:47] Those precious
[40:49] blood stains
[40:52] were made there just for me.
[41:00] for all my sins,
[41:04] my sickness, and my
[41:20] I claim the blood. Let's stand as we
[41:23] receive brother. I claim the blood.
[41:30] Jesus
[41:33] glory.
[41:38] Most precious
[41:40] days
[41:43] were
[41:45] just for me.
[41:52] My
[41:56] sickness and my
[42:08] heat.
[42:18] We thank the Lord Jesus for a wonderful
[42:20] time, haven't we?
[42:22] &gt;&gt; I don't know what to expect, saints. I
[42:24] really don't.
[42:26] We've gone to mark the spot
[42:30] for service.
[42:32] Morning service when kings come out to
[42:34] war. Second service. Third service.
[42:39] Can't hurt this music sheet. Right.
[42:41] Amen.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Music's going to come through. That
[42:43] hurts.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; This morning, we heard a message.
[42:50] He was there all the time.
[42:54] I don't know what the Holy Spirit has
[42:56] planned for this evening, but I'm just
[42:58] so happy to be here
[43:01] because he's got me in mind. And you
[43:04] must well, you might as well say, "Well,
[43:06] he's got me in mind, too, brother Tom.
[43:09] God put you here. I didn't put you here.
[43:12] And so now we're here to rejoice in the
[43:15] presence of the king, to look not to a
[43:18] man, but to look to the vessel himself,
[43:21] the God that's in the vessel, that the
[43:24] Holy Spirit will have his way. David
[43:27] said,
[43:28] "My cup
[43:31] runth over." Now young people, I want
[43:35] you to know I've been around a few years
[43:37] now and I have been into a lot of
[43:40] meetings, but I want to say through this
[43:43] set of meetings, my cup runth over.
[43:48] And may your cup run over tonight,
[43:51] whatever you desire when you pray, ask
[43:56] and you shall receive it.
[44:00] I believe the Holy Spirit has been from
[44:02] the beginning of the camp and it will be
[44:04] till the end of the camp. And we want to
[44:07] welcome those that have been uh coming
[44:09] to this camp over the last few days to
[44:12] see you here. It's nice to see you.
[44:15] You've made the camp special by being
[44:17] here. We thank you. Look around the room
[44:20] and you can see different ones that have
[44:22] been added. Their uh work is over.
[44:25] They've come to meet with God on a
[44:27] special camp meeting. This is our 10th
[44:30] anniversary of owning this camp. And to
[44:34] the God be the glory. We thank him for
[44:37] that.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; We thank you for the vision that we've
[44:40] had with our pastor.
[44:43] Because without a vision, the people
[44:45] perish. We know that scripture. We also
[44:48] understand that scripture to mean
[44:52] without a redemptive revelation
[44:55] the people will perish.
[44:57] And I believe that God has done his
[44:59] redeeming work and is doing his
[45:02] redeeming work within all of our lives
[45:05] through these meetings. It's been a
[45:07] blessing to have brother Ron Spencer and
[45:10] to have Andrew Spencer in the morning
[45:13] services. I feel I'm a very blessed man
[45:18] to be in these kind of meetings where
[45:21] men of God have separated themselves
[45:24] that the Holy Spirit could use them to
[45:27] speak to you and I. How many has been
[45:30] spoken to and dealt with? We can let the
[45:33] devil know that.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; We can let the devil know that God has
[45:38] specifically
[45:39] delivered you in these meetings. How
[45:42] many young people can wave their hand
[45:43] and said, "I've been delivered by the
[45:46] word of God."
[45:48] We give him glory tonight.
[46:00] These brothers could be somewhere else
[46:03] speaking some other meeting, some other
[46:05] camp meeting, but God has designated
[46:09] that they would be here. Brother Ron
[46:11] Spencer, pastor in Elk, Virginia, a long
[46:15] ways away, brought his dear wife and
[46:19] brother Spencer Junior. I called brother
[46:22] Ron Senior this morning and that didn't
[46:25] go over well. Not with you. It didn't go
[46:28] over well with him.
[46:32] But we love him. We love the gift of God
[46:34] in him. And he brought Sister Connie.
[46:38] And we want to thank you, Sister Connie,
[46:39] for coming. Brother Andrew brought
[46:42] Sister Katie and children. We thank them
[46:44] for coming. And I want to thank each and
[46:47] every one of you that's come from all
[46:49] over Canada, United States, even Europe
[46:53] to these meetings.
[46:55] To God be the glory. We are attracted
[46:58] not to a camp. We are attracted to the
[47:02] word himself. And we believe the word
[47:06] will have its way this evening. Lord, I
[47:09] lift your name as we invite brother Ron
[47:12] Spencer to come and speak to us through
[47:16] the word of God.
[47:18] Lord, I lift
[47:22] your
[47:24] name.
[47:27] your holy
[47:31] name.
[47:34] Jehovah
[47:37] God.
[47:39] Hello.
[47:45] You're the great
[47:49] I
[47:50] am
[47:59] my
[48:07] king.
[48:11] Lord, I lift your name.
[48:19] Holy
[48:22] name
[48:28] God.
[48:55] and my king.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord tonight.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; So good to see you in the house of the
[49:07] Lord. And I'm just honored to to stand
[49:10] here. We love you. And I just know that
[49:14] this night has some incredible things
[49:16] that's laying in front of us.
[49:22] So good to see brother Menow freezing.
[49:26] Amen.
[49:28] Hallelujah.
[49:30] A lot of words could be said right
[49:32] there, brother Mow. We love you with all
[49:35] of our hearts. And
[49:37] I was a much younger man when you came
[49:39] to Christiansburg and sang with the
[49:41] believers and and I was that boy drummer
[49:47] and
[49:49] I certainly love you. It was an honor
[49:52] the other day to have brother Logan in
[49:55] the meetings in Edmonton
[49:57] and we had a very brother Bisco. We had
[49:59] a very
[50:01] word wonderful moment at the end of the
[50:03] service.
[50:05] The power of the glory of the Lord just
[50:08] came in a special way.
[50:11] And it was just special.
[50:14] And he just he just came in. And
[50:19] I begin to sing on the wings of a snow
[50:21] white dove.
[50:24] And brother Logan, brother Kenboy, your
[50:26] son, was sitting about where you are.
[50:29] And I said, "Only God could orchestrate
[50:31] this." He had sat in the back of the
[50:34] building for the other services. I said,
[50:36] "Come, Brother Logan.
[50:39] Come and let's sing this together. On
[50:41] the wings of a snow white dove. We have
[50:44] a covenant with God.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; And it was as though the dove of the
[50:48] Holy Spirit just come and
[50:51] &gt;&gt; just fluttered his wings in the
[50:53] building. And
[50:54] &gt;&gt; we just know that he's here.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; That same God is here.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; God is brother Ken's healer.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; He's his healer.
[51:06] And and I I'm so thankful as
[51:09] as as
[51:11] brother Biscll stood and greeted me just
[51:14] a moment ago,
[51:18] God's his healer.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; And the music continues to sound.
[51:26] Two years ago today,
[51:29] Brother Michael Andes
[51:32] had one of those experiences where Satan
[51:35] tried to destroy his life.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Today,
[51:40] we celebrate life today, Brother
[51:42] Michael.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; We celebrate life and we're so thrilled.
[51:47] We heard you the other morning and or
[51:49] the other evening and we were so
[51:50] thrilled that what God is doing and
[51:53] maybe we can share something tomorrow
[51:55] for a 10th year anniversary. That would
[51:57] be wonderful.
[52:01] I hope I don't get in trouble, but I
[52:03] invited brother Michael Ray to set on
[52:05] the platform tonight.
[52:07] Last year,
[52:11] last year something very supernatural
[52:13] happened
[52:17] and I have been thrilled to watch the
[52:19] progress of what God is doing.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; I've heard every I I shared with him
[52:26] just a moment ago, Brother Biscll, I've
[52:28] listened to every word he said from the
[52:30] pull pit and I shout 3,000 miles away.
[52:36] I am thrilled.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; I am thrilled.
[52:42] I just told him something he already
[52:44] knowed.
[52:46] And so we're just thrilled. God
[52:50] God's a great God.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; He's just a great God.
[52:56] Maybe you have a need tonight that you'd
[52:57] just like to say, "Brother Ron,
[53:02] I'd like to reach out and touch him
[53:05] tonight.
[53:07] I walk to the pull pit tonight with not
[53:10] one but two brother-in-laws
[53:15] laying in the hospital with heart
[53:17] conditions.
[53:23] And as I walked out of the room this
[53:24] evening,
[53:27] I reminded the devil that he is a
[53:29] defeated enemy
[53:32] &gt;&gt; and we are disputing with a conquered
[53:35] devil.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; And so I would like for you to take not
[53:39] only brother Kin Boyer on your prayer,
[53:41] but brother Thomas Frasier and also
[53:44] brother Harold Shifflet
[53:47] and
[53:48] both with heart issues this afternoon.
[53:54] But I don't feel discouraged or defeated
[53:56] here.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; I feel like God is getting ready to do
[54:02] some real work.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you agree with me this
[54:06] evening tonight that
[54:08] &gt;&gt; I would like for you to just reach out
[54:10] and touch him? Now,
[54:12] &gt;&gt; our prophet has taught us a few
[54:14] principles. We get what we expect. Yes.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; If you come to criticize, you'll see
[54:20] something tonight that you'll be
[54:22] critical of.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; But if you come to see Jesus
[54:27] &gt;&gt; beyond the realm of mortality, I believe
[54:29] that you'll see him.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Because you see that we've invited him
[54:33] to come
[54:35] &gt;&gt; and he has came.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; We're already aware of his presence.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Now, let's just talk to him just now.
[54:42] And I'd like for you to call your need
[54:45] before the Lord, your personal need, and
[54:48] touch the hem of a garment just now.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Let's talk to him.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Almighty God, we bow our heads before
[54:55] you now.
[54:59] And we sense the presence of the Lord as
[55:02] as you're here.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan has bombarded and tried to
[55:07] attack
[55:09] in a lot of different directions.
[55:13] But we stand here by the authority and
[55:15] the commission of the word of the Lord.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; And we remind the devil that he has no
[55:21] barrel, no arrows for his bow.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't even have a key to his
[55:27] own gate.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you're a living God, not a
[55:34] historical God, but you're an I am God.
[55:39] and you're the one that gathered this
[55:41] meeting and draw these people. And
[55:44] &gt;&gt; it's not even an accident of where we're
[55:47] sitting in the building, Father.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, when men would line up chairs and
[55:53] place chairs, you knew who would sit in
[55:55] those chairs. You knew exactly where
[55:58] people would be sitted at tonight.
[56:00] Father, Lord, you know our need before
[56:03] we even call,
[56:04] &gt;&gt; but you ask us to call and you will
[56:07] answer.
[56:08] Oh, Father, just now I ask you that you
[56:12] would anoint the gift of
[56:15] &gt;&gt; as a speaker. Father,
[56:17] &gt;&gt; anoint my vocal cords this evening.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, may you bring this body strength
[56:23] this afternoon, Father. Now, I ask you,
[56:27] Lord Jesus, that you would anoint this
[56:29] audience.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Satan, we we charge you in the name of
[56:34] Jesus Christ. Take your hands off of
[56:37] God's children.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would use the term God's
[56:40] property in the name of Jesus Christ.
[56:44] He's nothing but a squatter anyway. And
[56:47] we rebuke him right now. And we send
[56:50] your word to Ken Ber and Sister Shelly
[56:53] tonight, Father. Lord, Brother Thomas
[56:56] Frasier and Brother Harold. Lord, we
[56:59] believe your word. You're a supernatural
[57:02] God tonight and we invite you to come by
[57:06] our way
[57:07] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; And amen and amen and amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God bless you.
[57:19] Amen.
[57:21] Hallelujah.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; I believe he's here.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:29] I'd like for us to look to St. John chap
[57:31] 11 this afternoon in verse 32.
[57:39] If you could help me tonight, I'd like
[57:41] to speak to you on
[57:43] roll away the stone.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; St. John 11 and verse 32.
[58:01] Then when Mary was come to where Jesus
[58:04] was and saw him,
[58:08] she fell down at his feet, saying unto
[58:10] him, Lord,
[58:13] if thou had us been here, my brother had
[58:17] not died.
[58:19] When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and
[58:22] the Jews and also weeping which came
[58:26] with her,
[58:27] he groaned in the spirit and was
[58:30] troubled
[58:33] and said, "Where have you laid him?"
[58:37] And they said unto him, "Lord, come and
[58:39] see."
[58:43] Jesus wept.
[58:47] Then said the Jews, "Behold how he loved
[58:51] him."
[58:53] And some of them said, "Could not this
[58:56] man which opened the eyes of the blind
[58:59] have caused even this man that should
[59:02] not have died?"
[59:04] Jesus therefore again groaning in
[59:06] himself cometh to the grave. It was a
[59:10] cave
[59:11] and a stone lay upon it.
[59:15] Jesus said, "Take yee away this stone,
[59:19] the stone." And Martha, the sister of
[59:23] him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord,
[59:27] by this time he stinkketh,
[59:31] for he had been dead four days.
[59:35] And Jesus saith unto her, said I not
[59:38] unto thee, and if thou wouldest believe
[59:42] that thou shouldest see the glory of
[59:44] God,
[59:46] then they took away the stone from the
[59:49] place where the dead was laid. And Jesus
[59:52] lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I
[59:56] thank thee that thou has heard me.
[1:00:00] And I knew that thou hearest me always,
[1:00:03] but because of the people which stand
[1:00:06] by, I said it,
[1:00:09] that they may believe that thou hast
[1:00:11] sent me."
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; And when he had thus had spoken, he
[1:00:15] cried with a loud voice,
[1:00:18] Lazarus, come forth.
[1:00:22] And he that was dead came forth,
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; bound to hand and foot with grave
[1:00:28] clothes,
[1:00:29] and his face was bound with a napkin.
[1:00:33] And Jesus said unto them, "Loose him and
[1:00:37] let him go."
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; You may be seated this evening.
[1:00:58] Oh, how tormenting it must be in the
[1:01:00] kingdom of hell
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; to hear those scriptures read over and
[1:01:07] over again. Oh yeah.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; And how that he might even think that if
[1:01:15] I was a politically correct speaker
[1:01:19] that I would get to the point and avoid
[1:01:22] some of the verses
[1:01:25] and just announce a text and move
[1:01:27] forward.
[1:01:30] How difficult it must believe be
[1:01:34] that all of the circumstances of
[1:01:36] humanity is presented to us this day.
[1:01:42] Here are believers in Jesus Christ.
[1:01:46] Message believers,
[1:01:48] modern day message believers of that
[1:01:50] day.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; People that had recognized more than a
[1:01:55] man that was standing among them. They
[1:01:58] had recognized that he was the
[1:02:00] resurrection and the life. Why? Brother
[1:02:03] Brandham would bring to our attention
[1:02:05] that it was Lazarus that had taken Jesus
[1:02:09] to John's baptism.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; So Lazarus had saw some incredible
[1:02:15] things in Jesus's ministry.
[1:02:18] No doubt this had been a home to which
[1:02:21] when Jesus was weary that he would go by
[1:02:23] and spend days with. And we can find out
[1:02:27] that he he had been a friend.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Why? When you're a friend, a friend of
[1:02:34] Jesus, it's always a good place to be
[1:02:36] at.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; I I would like to think that just like
[1:02:40] Abraham, he was a a friend of God.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to think that brother
[1:02:46] Brandon said that to be a friend, uh God
[1:02:48] had to have confidence in you. and he
[1:02:51] has confidence in the seed that he
[1:02:53] placed on the inside of you. And so
[1:02:56] Jesus enjoyed Lazarus's company.
[1:03:00] He enjoyed Mary and Martha, their home
[1:03:03] and their situation of life there. He
[1:03:06] enjoyed them.
[1:03:09] I want you to understand sometimes our
[1:03:11] circumstances
[1:03:13] seem to consume us.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; They seem to overwhelm our humanity. We
[1:03:19] look at the scene realm so many times
[1:03:21] and it if we're not careful, it'll
[1:03:23] override our faith if we're not not
[1:03:27] attentive to it. We'll begin to get worn
[1:03:30] and because of our energies begin to run
[1:03:33] dry. We'll begin to question certain
[1:03:36] things or try to place prophecy in the
[1:03:38] wrong spot or or we'll begin to wonder
[1:03:41] why this and why that.
[1:03:45] Lazarus begins to get a little bit weary
[1:03:48] and sick. They notice the sickness that
[1:03:50] is come coming on him. This sickness is
[1:03:54] just not a common sickness. They they
[1:03:56] see that this is beyond anything that
[1:03:58] they've seen happen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; And they send word. There's a meeting
[1:04:02] that's going and they send word to where
[1:04:05] Jesus is at.
[1:04:07] Your friend Lazarus is sick.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; And Jesus does not deter from his
[1:04:14] mission or his plan.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Now, no doubt some of his disciples
[1:04:20] thought,
[1:04:22] what's he going to do about that?
[1:04:26] Then he gets word again, Lazarus is
[1:04:29] sick.
[1:04:31] And he even plans and goes a different
[1:04:33] direction.
[1:04:39] They question earlier in the scriptures.
[1:04:44] Can you imagine the critics of that day?
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the blogs of that day?
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if we he'd have had
[1:04:55] media in that day?
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Of what they would have begin to scream
[1:05:01] out by text and email and
[1:05:06] Why? If Jesus was the friend, if he was
[1:05:10] so close to Lazarus, look, he can't even
[1:05:13] maintain a a close relationship.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And when the man really had needed help,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; he didn't go to where he was at.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; And Jesus made his way in a complete
[1:05:29] different direction. You see, God's got
[1:05:31] a plan.
[1:05:35] And it's just like the resurrection, the
[1:05:37] rapture. It's right on time.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Don't get ahead of God. Don't get in a
[1:05:45] hurry with God.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Men have proved when
[1:05:49] they get in a hurry, they produce the
[1:05:52] wrong kind of seed.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Abraham got in a hurry and he produced
[1:05:56] an Ishmamail. David got in a hurry and
[1:05:59] he murdered a man.
[1:06:02] Moses murdered a man. How many doctrines
[1:06:05] have been raised in this message by men
[1:06:08] that got in a hurry?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Whoops.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus made his way.
[1:06:24] And as he makes his way, no doubt back
[1:06:26] at the house
[1:06:28] now
[1:06:30] he's slipping away.
[1:06:33] He's slipping away to another dimension.
[1:06:37] He's slipping away.
[1:06:41] Their hope
[1:06:43] that Jesus would come is now
[1:06:46] deteriorating.
[1:06:51] And Lazarus begins to slip into another
[1:06:54] dimension
[1:06:56] and he begins to lift into another
[1:06:59] realm.
[1:07:03] And it seems like all hope is lost now.
[1:07:09] Death in the Old Testament was an
[1:07:12] insurmountable door.
[1:07:15] Job would ask about it,
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; what death was like.
[1:07:20] Are you with me now?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Since Adam, death had reigned.
[1:07:25] It was a terror.
[1:07:28] It was a vicious, seemingly dark,
[1:07:33] unimaginable thing that would happen
[1:07:37] to which that this life is over and and
[1:07:39] and there would be a seal
[1:07:42] somewhere standing in a great gulf.
[1:07:46] To this point,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; you can only believe in a resurrection.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; You can only hope for a resurrection.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; But to this point, no one had paid the
[1:07:56] price to get to that resurrection.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; They had a promise in Genesis chapter 3
[1:08:03] that there would be a resurrection.
[1:08:06] They had promises through the scriptures
[1:08:09] like Ezekiel that would say, "Son of
[1:08:11] man, can these bones live again?"
[1:08:14] And the breath of God begin to breathe
[1:08:16] across the house of Israel and raise it
[1:08:19] back up. I want you to understand it was
[1:08:22] by revelation that you could believe in
[1:08:24] a resurrection.
[1:08:26] Yes, sir.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus turns to his disciples now and and
[1:08:33] begins to make his way back.
[1:08:37] Word comes he's dead.
[1:08:40] And Jesus begins to make an interesting
[1:08:44] statement.
[1:08:46] He's sleeping
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; and I must go awake him.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; You see those disciples that had seen
[1:08:54] incredible miracles happen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; I just have to tell you, you and I seen
[1:09:01] some incredible things happen.
[1:09:04] But I I I just have to say now,
[1:09:08] brother Brandon begins to talk about
[1:09:10] even some small things. Said Peter,
[1:09:14] he was a fisherman.
[1:09:16] And being a fisherman, every time they
[1:09:18] got around the water, he would put his
[1:09:20] hook in the water.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; You find that in the scripture anywhere?
[1:09:29] Brother Brandham begin to bear out. He
[1:09:32] said they talked about taxes,
[1:09:35] had to go pay their taxes. And
[1:09:39] Jesus turns around to Peter and he said,
[1:09:42] "You have a hook."
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; You have a hook.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; And he and he tells him, he said, "Go
[1:09:49] down to a certain place and
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; you're going to catch a fish."
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; And you're not just going to catch a
[1:09:56] fish, but in his mouth.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; All right. any smile there's
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; enough money to pay the taxes.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; I've been on a couple guided trips.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; I've never had that kind of a guide.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, you want to take me on a
[1:10:25] fishing trip one day? By God's grace,
[1:10:28] we'll give you that opportunity.
[1:10:32] You heard that from the pull pit.
[1:10:35] But I can guarantee you, no matter how
[1:10:37] good the guide would be,
[1:10:41] no guide can guarantee
[1:10:45] catching a fish.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; First of all, catching the fish.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Second of all, open his mouth and
[1:10:52] there's enough money to pay the taxes.
[1:10:59] Are you with me now?
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; So many times we want to sew reason
[1:11:03] things together and put put science and
[1:11:07] put all kind of physics and all kind of
[1:11:09] laws and all kind of legalism. Figure
[1:11:12] that one out.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Just figure that one out. Figure out
[1:11:17] just the small things that happen.
[1:11:19] There's a boy comes to school and he's
[1:11:21] got a he's got a lunch with him and
[1:11:23] everybody's hungry. There's no motel.
[1:11:26] There's no restaurants. There's no
[1:11:28] Walmarts. And Jesus said, "Bring a
[1:11:31] little fellow up here." He said, "What
[1:11:32] do we have amongst us?" And a little guy
[1:11:34] comes with some fish and and a few
[1:11:36] loaves. And brother even says, "You
[1:11:39] skipped school."
[1:11:45] And Jesus takes this bread and this fish
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; and he blesses it.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; This was more than a man.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; This was more than a man that blessed
[1:12:02] that fish and blessed that bread.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Those men took their hands and begin to
[1:12:11] pass it out.
[1:12:14] Yes,
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; they read the scriptures about a mill
[1:12:17] barrel that never run dry.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; They could read the scriptures and what
[1:12:23] the prophet says about a about a a
[1:12:25] prophet that said, "Give me a double
[1:12:28] portion."
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; And he was still lacking one miracle.
[1:12:33] And they buried him in a tomb.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; And they throw a dead soldier in on top
[1:12:39] of him. And God had made that man a
[1:12:41] promise. And he brought that dead
[1:12:43] soldier to life.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; God is a is a confirmer of his word.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; He's that same God tonight.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; They saw some incredible things.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; But maybe even in their mind would be
[1:13:06] kind of like what's in this audience.
[1:13:14] Sometimes we don't get what we expect
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Have you ever got disappointed?
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; You ever got disappointed?
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; I I want this to this part to be very
[1:13:34] sobering. You ever got disappointed?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; You prayed and asked a prayer to God.
[1:13:39] Yeah.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And it didn't happen. And you even you
[1:13:43] even had prophetic word that said it's
[1:13:45] going to come to pass.
[1:13:49] I've got scripture for that. God himself
[1:13:52] came to a man
[1:13:55] after he had believed God for now 25
[1:14:00] years.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; And he even told the testimony
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; that I'm going to have a son. Right.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; And he took God at his word.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, he challenged us on
[1:14:15] that just a little bit. You want to get
[1:14:17] patient with God? He said, "Try 25
[1:14:19] years."
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Let me just say, when
[1:14:25] God says something's going to happen,
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; you can bank on it.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; You can absolutely bank on it. And don't
[1:14:35] even try to figure out how God's going
[1:14:37] to do business. He's going to do
[1:14:40] business.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Don't analyze it. Don't try to put the
[1:14:44] hat in the wrong place.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He said there'd be an
[1:14:50] animal with 42in horns. And I believe
[1:14:53] it.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Your pastor was a part of it.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; And we still believe it today.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word said there's going
[1:15:05] to be a rapture.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; And I believe it.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; That there will be a physical corporal
[1:15:10] return of Jesus Christ. And I'm going to
[1:15:13] take a step half a step that way. And
[1:15:16] our resurrected saints is going to take
[1:15:17] a half a step this way. And we're going
[1:15:20] to meet right here.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; And go to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; That's our promise.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; That's what believers believe.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:42] Jesus arrives where where they are at
[1:15:50] and
[1:15:52] they begin to present some
[1:15:55] some questions to him. Lord, if you'd
[1:15:59] have only been here
[1:16:02] our brother would not have died.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; They were missing what God was getting
[1:16:09] ready to do.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; I want you to think sometimes we come to
[1:16:13] service whether it's a Wednesday night
[1:16:15] or whenever it is.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we're sitting in the very
[1:16:21] thing that we need,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; And we're missing what God is wanting to
[1:16:28] do.
[1:16:31] If you'd have been here,
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; our brother would not have died.
[1:16:36] And Jesus told them that I am the
[1:16:38] resurrection
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; and I am the life.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; They even said said it correctly. The
[1:16:44] master is come.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; If I could say it tonight and just just
[1:16:49] talk to you, the master is here.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; The master is in the building right now.
[1:16:57] Hallelujah.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; If you could reach out, the greatest
[1:17:02] brain doctor is in the building, brother
[1:17:04] Men.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; We've seen him do incredible miracles in
[1:17:17] our life. And he's here.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; He's the same God.
[1:17:23] Now no doubt that those people that was
[1:17:26] around
[1:17:28] they were there and they had a lot of
[1:17:30] chatter
[1:17:33] and in their chatter
[1:17:36] they were chattering doubt and unbelief.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's talks about Jesus
[1:17:44] weeping.
[1:17:48] He said as a man he wept.
[1:17:51] He wept because of their unbelief.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; I have to be very honest with you.
[1:17:55] Sometimes I stand and in my study and I
[1:17:58] weep
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; because of people's unbelief.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; They got great needs.
[1:18:10] They got great situations in their life
[1:18:15] and they're standing in the right place.
[1:18:18] But they allow the enemy to rob them of
[1:18:20] their victory and their joy.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; I was with brother Roy Shrewsbury one
[1:18:26] time and we had a phenomenal meeting.
[1:18:30] Brother Roy is now in his 90s and
[1:18:32] preaching
[1:18:34] every Sunday. He's quite a man.
[1:18:43] They walked into the study with him and
[1:18:50] he was just standing there weeping.
[1:18:54] He said, "Brother Ron," he said,
[1:18:58] "So many times I'm thrilled by who comes
[1:19:00] to the altar." He said, "I'm just
[1:19:01] thrilled."
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "But what makes me weep is
[1:19:06] those that really need it." Yes.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; So true.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Sit right there and
[1:19:14] in a dry eye,
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; they're not moved.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Service after service after service,
[1:19:21] they just sit in the atmosphere
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; and they really miss what God is doing.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, to God, tonight I ask for a Holy
[1:19:31] Spirit to quicken our attention.
[1:19:35] Brother Benos use the term get
[1:19:37] desperate.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Shake yourself and pinch your
[1:19:41] conscience.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; These meetings are not just to just come
[1:19:46] and gather a people just to see if we
[1:19:49] could have a meeting.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? There's been huge
[1:19:53] congregations of phenomenal people
[1:19:55] gathered. Great audiences. But it's God
[1:19:58] that has gathered you
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; from all realms of the earth. He's
[1:20:03] gathered you
[1:20:05] sir
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; on this side of the resurrection.
[1:20:08] Gathered you to give you a charge of the
[1:20:12] dynamics of his spirit.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Don't miss what God wants to do.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Don't miss.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; How many times do we hear our prophet
[1:20:22] go, don't miss it.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it now.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it now. actually leaving a
[1:20:32] patient
[1:20:35] that's in the audience
[1:20:37] actually calling him out and talking to
[1:20:39] him
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; going to another patient and then go
[1:20:45] back to that man
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; and say don't miss it
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; are you with me
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; now listen that same God's here tonight
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; but he might not use me in the same way
[1:20:57] but I want to say this to you don't miss
[1:21:00] it.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Don't miss what God wants to do for you
[1:21:05] in this meeting. You've driven an
[1:21:07] incredible amount away. Don't let the
[1:21:09] devil
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; rob you.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Don't let him rob you.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Don't get your eyes on humanity.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Don't get your eyes on who's here, who's
[1:21:23] not here, what celebrities in the
[1:21:25] building. I could care less about
[1:21:27] celebrities.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] You could put all the celebrities in the
[1:21:32] world in a bag. I wouldn't give you a
[1:21:34] nickel for them.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; I want Godfilled sons and daughters of
[1:21:39] God that has a passion to serve God.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus wept.
[1:21:57] He wept.
[1:22:00] Now Jesus thanks
[1:22:03] God for their sake
[1:22:08] that he heard his prayer.
[1:22:14] Now Jesus could have rolled the stone.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; You know tombs are
[1:22:24] called the final resting place.
[1:22:28] Tombs are the spot to where that we bury
[1:22:30] our dead.
[1:22:34] Tombs are the spot that we say goodbye
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; in this realm.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Tombs are a difficult place to visit.
[1:22:46] So they choose certain headstones for a
[1:22:50] certain purpose
[1:22:52] to seal the st the tomb
[1:22:55] and they roll that stone into place
[1:22:59] and they seal it.
[1:23:02] It's seemably sealed to the
[1:23:05] resurrection.
[1:23:08] in sealing it. It has purpose,
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Because that body is going to
[1:23:14] deteriorate
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; and it's going to go back to the ashes
[1:23:18] and the gases.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; They wrapped it and put perfumes in it,
[1:23:24] not going into all of those things, but
[1:23:26] Lazarus's body began to deteriorate and
[1:23:29] go back to the dust which he came.
[1:23:40] Brother Brandham would give us another
[1:23:42] scene.
[1:23:44] He said Lazarus
[1:23:46] had went to the realm where Abraham was
[1:23:48] at
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; and he said there they begin to
[1:23:56] fellowship.
[1:23:59] I can just imagine their conversations
[1:24:04] as they begin to exchange stories
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; and Lazarus would tell Abraham and Isaac
[1:24:10] and Jacob what it was like to be with
[1:24:13] Jesus.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; And Abraham would say, "I I met one like
[1:24:18] that."
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; He had no beginning of days or ending of
[1:24:23] nights. And he knew my name. And he came
[1:24:26] and said, "And there was never a man
[1:24:29] like that man."
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; And he spoke to me, "Sarah, come listen.
[1:24:34] We're listening to the same kind of a
[1:24:35] man."
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And during the conversation,
[1:24:43] there's another conversation going on in
[1:24:45] another room. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And Jesus asked his sisters,
[1:24:53] "Roll away the stone."
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus could have spoke that stone away.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; The same way that he could speak your
[1:25:03] storm away.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Yeah.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; The same way that he could just just
[1:25:13] take your problems away in a moment's
[1:25:16] notice.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; But he asked those girls.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Roll the stone.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Roll the stone.
[1:25:29] Now, let me just say this to you. As
[1:25:32] long as it's your favorite preacher,
[1:25:35] anybody can. Amen.
[1:25:40] And it's your favorite quote. It's easy
[1:25:42] to Amen.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Your favorite singer. Everybody can get
[1:25:46] in the right atmosphere.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; You've enjoyed dinner with Jesus. You've
[1:25:54] enjoyed miracles with Jesus. You've
[1:25:56] enjoyed the parables with Jesus. You've
[1:25:59] enjoyed incredible phenomenal times with
[1:26:01] Jesus. But now he's just asked you to
[1:26:04] identify yourself with him.
[1:26:09] Because now all of those mourers that
[1:26:12] have been such sympathetic with you
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; are going to watch you participate.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; They're going to watch you take personal
[1:26:24] responsibility.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Now you got responsibility with him.
[1:26:33] That's right.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Now, you're going beyond the human
[1:26:37] element to believe.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; You're challenged to believe.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; How many squirrels do you want?
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; How many He's walking away after the
[1:26:51] second one. He said, "You asked for
[1:26:52] three."
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; How many times have you asked God for
[1:26:58] things
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; and you're challenged to believe? Yeah,
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; you're challenged to confess
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; and step out of the realm of faith and
[1:27:08] take God at his word
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; to take the book and eat the book
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; and identify that I'm a part of this
[1:27:16] message.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Everybody can enjoy the burden until
[1:27:23] it's theirs.
[1:27:41] I can hear the critic go,
[1:27:44] look at him.
[1:27:47] He's going to let women move that stone.
[1:27:55] He could have asked his disciples.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; He could have asked Peter,
[1:28:02] strong man.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Well, he could have put his hands on it.
[1:28:15] Roll away the stone.
[1:28:18] You see, that was as great a miracle as
[1:28:22] Lazarus is coming for
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; is when they actually put their hands on
[1:28:28] it.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; You see, once you put your hands on it,
[1:28:37] you're part of it.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; You won't get many critics standing off
[1:28:43] to the side.
[1:28:45] Everybody can be a Monday morning
[1:28:47] quarterback.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; You know, if I was the pastor, I'd do it
[1:28:51] this way.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; You know, if I was running the show, I'd
[1:28:55] do it this way. If I was making a call,
[1:28:58] I'd do it this way.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; So, we stand in audiences
[1:29:05] just like Jesus was standing there.
[1:29:13] And they put their hands on the stone,
[1:29:23] Lord.
[1:29:25] But now he stinkketh.
[1:29:31] Notice where they said he stinkketh
[1:29:34] when they put their hands on it. Cuz now
[1:29:36] they knew something was getting ready to
[1:29:37] happen.
[1:29:42] Have you read the doctor's report?
[1:29:44] Yeah.
[1:29:57] And they push
[1:30:07] and they step back.
[1:30:10] Now, brother Brandham said
[1:30:13] that Jesus called him by name.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; You know, I marvel I'm preaching
[1:30:24] something so simple to such a vast crowd
[1:30:26] because the Lord put it on my heart to
[1:30:28] preach this tonight.
[1:30:30] But I feel like I'm standing in front of
[1:30:32] some tombs.
[1:30:37] Some dead in sin,
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; trapped.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; And even sitting amongst meetings like
[1:30:45] this, the enemy's held you.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; And life hasn't been breathed to you.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; You see, sin brings death.
[1:30:58] It doesn't look like death, but it
[1:31:00] brings death. It takes you somewhere.
[1:31:04] sin. We can attribute it to many
[1:31:06] different things, but it's really
[1:31:07] unbelief.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; And I wonder sometimes how many times we
[1:31:11] even said in our in our our assemblies,
[1:31:15] and unbelief fills our heart.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; We can believe it for others, but what
[1:31:19] about oursel?
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; We can believe it for others, and we we
[1:31:24] just wonder what in the world's going
[1:31:26] on.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Maybe things have got us trapped.
[1:31:33] I understand about a coma
[1:31:37] and I share this with you. I understand
[1:31:39] about a coma.
[1:31:41] A coma is a person that's alive
[1:31:44] and very much alive and in many cases
[1:31:48] very much aware
[1:31:50] but the body is trapped and it can't
[1:31:52] move. It can't respond.
[1:31:55] But the senses are very much aware. It
[1:31:58] can hear. It can understand. didn't
[1:32:01] comprehend.
[1:32:05] I told Sister Connie conversations that
[1:32:07] people came in the room and had with
[1:32:09] her.
[1:32:11] There were people that told Sister
[1:32:13] Connie,
[1:32:14] "You're young enough,
[1:32:18] you're young enough when brother Ron
[1:32:20] dies, you can marry again."
[1:32:24] Their hearts were filled with unbelief.
[1:32:26] Jesus,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; we you can smile at that. But listen,
[1:32:32] that's a pitiful story.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Instead of taking God at his word
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; and brother said, "Never think a ne
[1:32:39] negative thought."
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Instead of burying me, pray for me.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, I'm going to
[1:32:46] challenge you tonight.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Instead, instead of looking at the
[1:32:50] negative side, take God at his word and
[1:32:53] believe God.
[1:32:56] It's easy to just dismiss where brother
[1:32:58] Brandham's off the scene and God don't
[1:33:00] do those things anymore. God's still
[1:33:02] very much alive.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:33:07] forever. And if there ever was a group
[1:33:10] of people that ought to believe in God
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; and the miracle working of God, it ought
[1:33:16] to be the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:27] Maybe
[1:33:31] it's music.
[1:33:35] I was
[1:33:37] I was in prayer the other day
[1:33:41] and maybe this will be
[1:33:44] this will be kind of eyeopening for you
[1:33:47] because it was for me.
[1:33:50] I was in prayer
[1:33:54] about suicide
[1:33:56] spirits
[1:33:58] and how those things want to come
[1:33:59] amongst our young people
[1:34:02] to steal their life
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; and to tell them they're not worthy
[1:34:08] just literally try to end their lives
[1:34:10] and it's not worth living no more.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; After much prayer, God spoke in my
[1:34:19] heart. It's the music.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; It's the music from the realm of hell.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; It's the music that echoes, whether it
[1:34:30] be country or whether it be rock or
[1:34:33] whether it be some kind of a rap or some
[1:34:36] kind of crazy music calling out from a
[1:34:39] dark dimension,
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; destroying marriages and destroying
[1:34:44] homes and destroying lives.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; That music begins to call out to that
[1:34:53] dark realm.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; If we're not careful, we'll find
[1:35:02] ourselves in the tombs of movies.
[1:35:06] If
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; we're not careful, we'll find ourselves
[1:35:10] in the tombs of denomination and
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; before long settling for something less
[1:35:15] than what we've got
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; and listening to another voice,
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; a voice that is contaminated.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Listen. When you've
[1:35:26] got a pure voice to listen to and you've
[1:35:29] got Godqualifist
[1:35:32] to hear preach, we have no shortage of
[1:35:35] phenomenal speaking in this world that
[1:35:39] have been been dipped in the oil and
[1:35:42] have ate the book and preached the word
[1:35:44] with purity.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Why should our eyes
[1:35:51] toward turn toward systems that have let
[1:35:54] down the bars
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; and ate from the filth of Leoa,
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; knowing that one word wrong
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; separates us
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; from fellowship with God.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; That'll cause you to go into a tomb.
[1:36:19] Maybe your marriage is in a tomb. This
[1:36:22] is a family camp.
[1:36:26] I hope this is all right. I feel that.
[1:36:29] And so here we are.
[1:36:39] I'm sure Dr. Dobson was a good man.
[1:36:47] But we don't need psychology to fix our
[1:36:49] marriage.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Your amen should have been better than
[1:36:59] that.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; You don't need to go to Barnes & Noble
[1:37:03] to get a a a book marriage for dummies.
[1:37:15] I'll tell you, your marriage should have
[1:37:16] a a prayer life in it.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; You should never get too busy to have a
[1:37:23] prayer life going on in your home.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? That altar should
[1:37:28] be a home that's got an altar, a prayer
[1:37:31] life that is going on in that home. That
[1:37:33] that home can be a sanctuary.
[1:37:36] Whether it's a town or a castle, it
[1:37:39] should be a sanctuary where almighty God
[1:37:42] dwells at.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It should not be a home
[1:37:46] of fussing and fighting and arguing over
[1:37:48] a dollar.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Preacher.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Our best friend should be our wife or
[1:37:55] our husband. That's who our best friend
[1:37:58] should be.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But I'm afraid too many
[1:38:04] marriages have been killed by
[1:38:06] entertainment
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; or the drive for money
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; and their marriages have been murdered.
[1:38:33] I have a table that seats 18
[1:38:37] at my home.
[1:38:44] It was made by the Amish.
[1:38:47] It's maple.
[1:38:53] It was cheap. That's why I bought it.
[1:39:02] It's a nice table.
[1:39:06] 18 chairs.
[1:39:08] Many people come to my table and sit and
[1:39:10] look and my family's all around and they
[1:39:13] go, "What a wonderful family.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; It's not an accident. Right.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; It's not an accident I have a wonderful
[1:39:22] family. I dedicated my family to the
[1:39:24] Lord.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; We dedicated our family to the Lord.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; And I refuse to give one.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to negotiate and say,
[1:39:38] "Well, I'll give you this one and I'll
[1:39:40] take this one. I'll give you this one
[1:39:42] and I'll take this one." Yes, sir.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's non-negotiable.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; I want every one of them.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; So I come against that spirit of hell.
[1:40:00] Yes, sir.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; We had something very supernatural
[1:40:07] happen in our home. Is this okay?
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; So many I've had people say, "You
[1:40:12] shouldn't tell personal stories." What
[1:40:14] you tell me what I can tell if I can't
[1:40:15] tell personal stories.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; The same person that told me that I went
[1:40:29] back and listened to their tape
[1:40:32] of what they just told
[1:40:38] and they don't live up to their own
[1:40:39] word.
[1:40:43] God's a personal God.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim's granddaughter's here. I
[1:40:53] don't know where she's at. I can't find
[1:40:54] her. Thank you. She's a short girl. I
[1:40:58] like short people.
[1:41:01] I hope that doesn't add to your complex.
[1:41:02] But
[1:41:10] Adriana
[1:41:13] You can remember the night that
[1:41:16] there was a prayer line
[1:41:20] at your granddaddy's meeting.
[1:41:24] We actually sat in the back and
[1:41:28] and we actually talked about
[1:41:32] we present this service to the Lord.
[1:41:39] You see your I I guess it would be your
[1:41:41] cousin Drew
[1:41:44] that had received the miracle of I saw a
[1:41:47] vision that Drew would walk
[1:41:51] and he didn't walk immediately. Many of
[1:41:54] you know the story, but I'm not going to
[1:41:56] take the time. But it would be sometime
[1:41:58] later that Drew, who had been born with
[1:42:01] a debilitating bone situation,
[1:42:05] that Sister Karen Puit had had a brain
[1:42:07] bleed
[1:42:09] and and God spared her life and and she
[1:42:14] was sitting and and she was kind of kind
[1:42:17] of had the blues about not being able to
[1:42:20] do all the things that she used to do
[1:42:21] and not be able to feel as good as she
[1:42:23] used to feel.
[1:42:25] You know, sometimes she just felt
[1:42:27] trapped in her body of what it was like.
[1:42:32] I know what it is to feel kind of
[1:42:33] trapped in your body and would like for
[1:42:36] it to do better and like for it to do
[1:42:38] more and like to have more energy or
[1:42:40] like to be able to do this or that.
[1:42:43] And she something just come on her and
[1:42:45] she began to worship the Lord and and
[1:42:47] the presence of God dropped in the room
[1:42:49] and Drew was at her feet.
[1:42:53] And when the presence of God came and
[1:42:55] healed her, it also healed that baby.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; And Drew began to run all over the room.
[1:43:01] And
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; she began to worship the Lord.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; I came to that meeting that night.
[1:43:12] Brother Kim, I I walked to the pull pit
[1:43:15] like I've walked to this pull pit and I
[1:43:17] asked, "Where's Drew at?"
[1:43:21] And Drew was in the bed. They put him to
[1:43:25] bed and I said, "Could you go get him?"
[1:43:29] And they brought him in pajamas. I think
[1:43:32] I don't know remember the color. Do you
[1:43:33] remember the color? Maybe orange.
[1:43:38] I like orange pajamas, too.
[1:43:43] And I took Drew out of his arms. And you
[1:43:46] talk about a miracle. He came to me
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; and I begin to tell that audience,
[1:43:51] we're going to have a prayer line here
[1:43:53] in a few minutes.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know what God's going to do in
[1:43:56] this meeting, but he's here.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; And I took Drew and I began to walk him
[1:44:01] across the stage backwards and forwards.
[1:44:04] And I said, "Some of you are going to
[1:44:07] walk in these same steps that this
[1:44:09] little boy used to not be able to walk,
[1:44:11] but he's walking across."
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And we walk backwards and forwards.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Can I share with you just a few events
[1:44:22] that happened that night?
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Yes.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; How many knows the story of Mariah?
[1:44:37] Mariah had a disease
[1:44:40] and it was a disease that had taken the
[1:44:43] hair off of her body.
[1:44:47] Alipcia
[1:44:49] alipcia. I'm from Virginia.
[1:44:55] alipcia
[1:44:57] and her hair was leaving her body.
[1:45:02] Brother Tim had prayed for him months
[1:45:04] before.
[1:45:07] She came to that prayer line. She only
[1:45:10] had a strand. Now she's wearing a a knit
[1:45:13] tob bargain
[1:45:16] nice hat and she's wearing that
[1:45:21] but she comes with bobby pins. How many
[1:45:24] knows what bobby pins are?
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; She comes with bobby pins into that
[1:45:28] prayer line and she's carrying them.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; I believe after tonight I'm going to
[1:45:34] need these bobby pins.
[1:45:41] I want you to know that tonight her hair
[1:45:43] is thick
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; and long
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; and beautiful.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; We saw one miracle after another take
[1:46:04] place that night.
[1:46:08] I begin to weary.
[1:46:11] Brother Wendell Martin's wife, her name.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Jessica,
[1:46:20] thank you for all your help.
[1:46:22] Like brother Brandham said, I didn't
[1:46:24] know all of you were from Kentucky.
[1:46:29] She walks across the stage amongst the
[1:46:32] other hundreds.
[1:46:35] I felt the spirit of the Lord speak to
[1:46:37] her.
[1:46:39] I give you your son.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know even right now where he was
[1:46:46] at, but he was way out in sin and it
[1:46:48] seemed hopeless.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; You're talking about calling out of a
[1:46:52] grave.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; That boy is now a believer.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; That boy's married.
[1:47:06] Glory to God.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; It was God that called him out of the
[1:47:10] grave that night.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; I stepped off of the stage a bit later,
[1:47:15] very weary, and fell into the arms of
[1:47:17] Brother Tim Wyers and carried me. And
[1:47:20] Brother Aaron Oglesby
[1:47:22] and Andrew that's sitting behind me on
[1:47:24] the stage would carry me to the room and
[1:47:26] he can confirm all of these things.
[1:47:30] And as they carry me into the room where
[1:47:32] I was at, I turn to brother Aaron
[1:47:34] Oglesby
[1:47:36] and I tell him, "You'll never be the
[1:47:39] same from this night forward."
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Here's the reason I have you on the
[1:47:43] stage, Brother Michael. It was a night
[1:47:46] like your night.
[1:47:52] And brother Aaron Oglesby,
[1:47:55] he's a big boy. I don't know. Everybody
[1:47:59] over six foot tall's giants to me,
[1:48:04] brother Aaron. I said, "God's called you
[1:48:07] to preach the gospel to carry the
[1:48:10] greatest message that there's ever been
[1:48:11] on the foundation of the world."
[1:48:15] I began to pray with him and he laid
[1:48:17] back against the wall and he be to
[1:48:20] worship and he went back to the meeting
[1:48:22] and he was all over the place. I'm to
[1:48:25] Today's different. Today's different.
[1:48:28] I'll never be the same. I'll never be
[1:48:31] the same.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; You can go listen to it. It wasn't a man
[1:48:36] called him.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a man's anointing that called
[1:48:41] that boy,
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; but he's a powerhouse.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Because we got the greatest message that
[1:48:47] there's ever been on the face of the
[1:48:49] earth. Scream it from the echoes of your
[1:48:52] heart.
[1:48:54] Scream it. Maybe your job's not to be a
[1:48:56] preacher. Maybe your job's to be a
[1:48:58] singer. Your job's to be an amen. Just
[1:49:01] do the job that God's given you to do.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:49:22] These things are true that I'm telling
[1:49:23] you.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; As I lay back on the bed, I saw a vision
[1:49:28] of a little boy in our family.
[1:49:32] And I said, "Andrew,
[1:49:34] we're going to have a little boy."
[1:49:38] He said, "Not me, Daddy."
[1:49:48] Sister Connie comes in the room.
[1:49:52] She be to rejoice.
[1:49:58] My daughter couldn't have children.
[1:50:03] My son-in-law had been crushed in an
[1:50:05] accident.
[1:50:07] She in her own womb couldn't carry a
[1:50:09] child.
[1:50:12] My son-in-law had been crushed in an
[1:50:13] accident. His shoulder was crushed. His
[1:50:16] ribs were crushed. His pelvis was
[1:50:18] crushed. And I heard the doctor say,
[1:50:20] "It's crushed worse than any other man
[1:50:22] that I've ever put back together." He
[1:50:25] said, "But we'll put them back together,
[1:50:27] and God will do the healing."
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; My son-in-law's back to work now.
[1:50:40] He's quite an avid hunter. He's back to
[1:50:42] hunting.
[1:50:44] It was in August.
[1:50:47] They came through a prayer line at her
[1:50:50] own church. I think one of maybe two
[1:50:52] that we've had in our own assembly,
[1:50:56] quite on that order.
[1:50:58] And she came down through the prayer
[1:51:00] line holding Davey's hand. And I said,
[1:51:03] "Witney, tonight's the night.
[1:51:06] God's going to give you that baby that
[1:51:08] you've been desiring.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; The sister that was behind her brother
[1:51:15] Ed, her and her husband had their hands
[1:51:18] a hold. Only God can do these things.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Anything else is just hopes
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; it's more than reading somebody's
[1:51:26] spirit.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; More than some convenient situation.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; This ain't some denomination trying to
[1:51:32] work a gift up or manufacture. You don't
[1:51:34] have to manufacture for Jesus.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; And I told her, I said, "The same angel
[1:51:40] of the Lord is visiting your house."
[1:51:42] Now,
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; you can't make this up.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; They went to the baby doctor on the same
[1:51:53] day
[1:51:55] at the very same time.
[1:52:00] And they walked in the office together
[1:52:02] and said, "Oh,
[1:52:04] you're pregnant."
[1:52:09] And one of them said to the other, "We
[1:52:11] were in the same prayer line."
[1:52:14] Amen.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[1:52:28] you're either standing on one side or
[1:52:30] you're standing on the other.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; You're either enjoying the miracles or
[1:52:35] you're standing and doubting.
[1:52:42] You didn't realize that even those
[1:52:44] personal stories were a trap to you,
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; but you don't have to stay there.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; you don't have to stay there. You can
[1:52:54] believe for your own situation.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; What about your lost children? What
[1:52:59] about your lost brothers and sisters?
[1:53:01] What about your backsliding condition?
[1:53:04] What about your life that's been
[1:53:06] stripped?
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; So many times we can put quotes
[1:53:22] together, but we can't believe for the
[1:53:24] supernatural.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; We want sermons preached on the seventh
[1:53:29] seal.
[1:53:31] when I'm standing here preaching third
[1:53:33] pull to you.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; You don't need a label.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; You don't need a label.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; So many times we want to give somebody a
[1:53:48] book and give them an intellectual
[1:53:49] ability.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; If I can intellectually give you
[1:53:52] something, Satan will come along and
[1:53:54] give you an intellectual something
[1:53:56] stronger.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; But if you receive Jesus Christ,
[1:54:02] If you receive this by revelation and
[1:54:04] you put your hands on the rock yourself,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; come on. Your computer can quote this
[1:54:12] message.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Your computer, your phone can quote this
[1:54:18] message, but it can't live it.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Your computer can do all of those
[1:54:28] things. It's good to have pictures. It's
[1:54:31] good to have tapes. It's good to have
[1:54:33] books. But this message wants to live in
[1:54:36] your life.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Son of man, can these bones live again?
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; So I'm prophesying to you tonight. Let
[1:54:49] it live.
[1:55:01] You know what the interesting thing is?
[1:55:02] That God not only showed me the vision,
[1:55:04] but he gave him gave me his name,
[1:55:09] Isaac Jackson.
[1:55:15] And I never did tell Whitney or Davey
[1:55:19] what God showed me,
[1:55:23] but I wrote it down.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; That's not a great big thing. Don't
[1:55:30] Don't even think that's a great big
[1:55:31] thing. God wrote your name.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:55:43] Right here.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Right here is What do you call that? Is
[1:55:47] there a nurse here? Ultrasound picture.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; I knew you had to be here.
[1:55:55] It's an ultrasound picture. I carry it
[1:55:58] in my Bible of Isaac.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; I do it for a reason.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Man saw him before he was born. Right.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; God saw him
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; like he saw you
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Were you surprised it was a boy? No.
[1:56:35] At the gender to reveal party, I didn't
[1:56:37] even fill out a thing. I thought it
[1:56:39] would be unfair.
[1:56:42] What do you think his name would be? I
[1:56:44] didn't fill it out. I thought that would
[1:56:45] be unfair.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; When I held him,
[1:57:00] I'm going to share something with you.
[1:57:04] I was writing the notes for that
[1:57:06] dedication service.
[1:57:09] And I was writing down
[1:57:12] everything that I just told you in my
[1:57:15] study.
[1:57:17] Sister Connie was doing her hair all the
[1:57:21] way on the other end of the house
[1:57:24] and she felt a wind
[1:57:27] like I felt when it came through the
[1:57:29] rooms.
[1:57:32] When I wrote down
[1:57:35] Jessica Martin,
[1:57:38] give you your son,
[1:57:42] I felt the wind come through the
[1:57:43] building.
[1:57:49] Oh, may that wind come through this
[1:57:51] building.
[1:57:53] Hallelujah.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; There's a man sitting in our church that
[1:58:02] was died in our service. His name's Doug
[1:58:04] Hill. He died.
[1:58:09] We didn't get excited. We just walked
[1:58:11] over to him and laid our hands on him.
[1:58:15] Just what the word said. I don't know
[1:58:17] what God will do, but I know what God's
[1:58:19] able to do.
[1:58:21] We said a simple prayer and I said,
[1:58:24] "Brother Doug, stay with me. Come back
[1:58:25] to me." And he'd been gone now minutes
[1:58:28] now.
[1:58:31] And in just a minute, he sat up. He
[1:58:34] said, "I'm here."
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; I'm here.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; What was it like, Brother Ron? It was a
[1:58:43] phenomenal
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; feeling. It's a very sobering feeling.
[1:58:47] Yeah,
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; the resurrected one was was sitting now
[1:58:52] among us.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; He saw himself slipping away.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; God called him back.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; You see, Lazarus was in another realm
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; and he was talking about him
[1:59:10] and all of a sudden he heard his name.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he did. Brother Brandham said,
[1:59:15] "Had he not called him by name,
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; he would have called a general
[1:59:20] resurrection."
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; I go to Europe, Brother David.
[1:59:32] I was in Ireland not long ago and I
[1:59:34] walked I walked into where John Wesley
[1:59:38] or Columba spoke and Cola had been the
[1:59:42] pastor of that church and there's
[1:59:45] deacons that were buried that were there
[1:59:47] and their names is almost gone from the
[1:59:50] stones and I stood over top of those
[1:59:53] graves and I thought hundreds and
[1:59:57] thousands of people have walked by these
[1:59:59] graves and no doubt their bodies and
[2:00:02] their bones are gone.
[2:00:04] They're nothing but dust. But one of
[2:00:07] these mornings,
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; you'll think those miracles that you
[2:00:16] just heard
[2:00:18] are phenomenal. But what are these
[2:00:21] warnings?
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; He's going to call
[2:00:31] And there's not a devil in hell
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; can stop them
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; from coming forward.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; There's a rapture coming
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; and devil. The devil has put every bit
[2:00:50] of unbelief that he could try to put on
[2:00:54] you.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Challenge you in your circumstances.
[2:01:00] challenge you in your situations.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Put your hands on the stone tonight.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Put your hands on the stone.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Do you believe?
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; We want to ask you,
[2:01:22] do you now believe?
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Because you're one part of the rapture.
[2:01:30] You happen to be the live and remain.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; We are.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll, he talked to you
[2:01:40] personally
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; about what that land is like.
[2:01:55] I don't mind saying it.
[2:01:58] Brother Ed Bisco is one of my favorite
[2:02:00] preachers, too.
[2:02:06] I take all of my money and put it put it
[2:02:08] in his account right now if he'd preach
[2:02:09] in the morning.
[2:02:29] Brother Kim, I've heard him tell about
[2:02:31] how brother Brandham talked to him about
[2:02:33] that land.
[2:02:36] I set feet from him
[2:02:42] like you have
[2:02:47] as he tells the stories of how brother
[2:02:48] Brandham talks about what it was like
[2:02:54] here. for his grandson.
[2:03:04] I asked where's Sam? Sam's in the
[2:03:08] building.
[2:03:10] I asked brother Sam today. I said, "Do
[2:03:13] you guys know who Ed Biscll is?"
[2:03:17] Is that okay?
[2:03:19] Does your children know who he is?
[2:03:24] Now, I'm going to a real key right now.
[2:03:27] You know who he is.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes
[2:03:37] while we've got an incredible gift among
[2:03:39] us, if we really appreciate the gift,
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not out on a limb now. I've still
[2:03:47] got scripture on my side.
[2:03:53] you shake his hand with Walmart on your
[2:03:55] mind
[2:03:57] or where you going to eat.
[2:04:02] I think sometimes we miss the moments.
[2:04:07] Brother Menow, you've been a pastor for
[2:04:09] many years. I wonder if people miss
[2:04:14] the gift that God put in your life.
[2:04:21] Brother Tom,
[2:04:30] brother, on your way out on a limb.
[2:04:32] Really?
[2:04:34] Cuz people missed Jesus.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; They missed Jesus. They saw a not so
[2:04:44] good robe.
[2:04:49] not Hollywood hair,
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; rugged skin,
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; and they missed who he was.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Can I finish this evening with these
[2:05:05] thoughts? In John chapter 12,
[2:05:11] there's a meeting like tonight.
[2:05:18] And Jesus is there and Lazarus is there.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; This is mind-blowing to me.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; This is
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; This is absolutely mind-blowing to me
[2:05:32] that Jesus is in the building and
[2:05:34] Lazarus, the one who was dead and now
[2:05:38] alive, he's in the building
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; and people came.
[2:05:44] Yeah.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; And many were led to Jesus because of
[2:05:49] Lazarus. But there was people there that
[2:05:53] wanted to put Lazarus to death.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; There was people that wanted to kill
[2:06:03] Lazarus.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; You know,
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; you know, he had to thought that was
[2:06:10] amusing.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; You're right.
[2:06:15] You know, he had the thought, "Really?
[2:06:20] That's not so bad.
[2:06:22] I was just there a few days ago. I know
[2:06:26] where I'm going.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; That's the same as here tonight.
[2:06:42] That's the same as here tonight. The
[2:06:45] tombs have been opened.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; The stones have been rolled away.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; And some of you are alive, but there's
[2:06:53] others that like to put you back to
[2:06:54] death.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Stupid devil.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Stupid devil.
[2:07:07] Once you have tasted of life, you won't
[2:07:10] know part of death.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Once you've heard his voice, it settles
[2:07:18] every sin question in your life.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Once you've been in his presence one
[2:07:25] time,
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; you can look at the stone and it could
[2:07:30] be a memorial. It was a dungeon for me,
[2:07:34] but it became my best of you to walk
[2:07:37] into life.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[2:08:04] Let me finish this sermon the way that I
[2:08:06] started it. It must have been
[2:08:08] disappointed in hell.
[2:08:21] Every time you read John 11, it reminds
[2:08:24] the devil we had him.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; We had him.
[2:08:31] Every time ministers read, Brother Brian
[2:08:34] talks about, "Oh, when when Jesus came
[2:08:37] to to Satan's kingdom, walked up to the
[2:08:42] gates and told him that he was a
[2:08:44] virgin-born son of God and his blood was
[2:08:47] still wet on the cross.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; And he took the keys of death, hell, and
[2:08:50] a grave." And he stood there in
[2:08:52] Revelation chapter one and he said, "I
[2:08:54] am he that was dead and I am alive
[2:08:57] forever more and I have the keys of
[2:09:00] death, hell, and the grave.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; I would like to ask you tonight to put
[2:09:12] your hands on your stone."
[2:09:20] By now
[2:09:22] you stinkketh.
[2:09:28] By now you stink.
[2:09:30] But if you can just put your hands on
[2:09:32] the stone
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; and give it a push,
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; this camp meeting will never be the
[2:09:41] same.
[2:09:47] Sister Adriana, you came a long way.
[2:09:51] Put your hands on the stone. You got
[2:09:54] little hands.
[2:09:56] Put your little hands on the stone.
[2:10:01] Push by faith.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Fighting things.
[2:10:12] fighting things before you came here.
[2:10:15] Won't you put your hands on it and say,
[2:10:17] "You're not going to hold me bondage no
[2:10:19] more."
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; What about your marriage?
[2:10:28] What about your marriage?
[2:10:31] What about your relationship with
[2:10:33] family?
[2:10:37] Satan's tried to steal your children
[2:10:38] away. Take them back.
[2:10:41] What about your brothers and your
[2:10:43] sisters
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; that have tried that seemingly are
[2:10:46] slipping away? Put your hands on the
[2:10:48] stone.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Put your hands on the stone.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; And what seems insurmountable to move,
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus is behind you.
[2:11:13] Hallelujah.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Your children might be saved. Call out
[2:11:17] somebody else's children.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Put your hands against the stone.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; I'm honest. I put my hands against the
[2:11:27] stone.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; For and I call some names before this
[2:11:31] service. I'm not going to make it that
[2:11:33] personal, but I refuse to let Satan
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; run rough shot.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; I refuse.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; We're not some mambby pamby little
[2:11:55] powerless church. We're the church of
[2:11:57] the living God. The sword is in your
[2:12:00] hand. Take God at his word tonight.
[2:12:05] You're the invincible army that God knew
[2:12:08] that was going to be here. Nobody else
[2:12:10] is coming. You're here. You've been
[2:12:12] challenged.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; How many gifts do you have to be shook
[2:12:17] in front of you that you come alive?
[2:12:20] Take God at his word, Sister Emma. Take
[2:12:23] God at his word. Believe God. Take him
[2:12:27] at his word.
[2:12:30] Jesus.
[2:12:58] Sister Anne, take him at his word.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Joanna, take him at his word.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Jessica,
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Jonathan, I just called their names.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Brother David, sorry to point your
[2:13:15] children out, but
[2:13:18] just use him an example. Take him at his
[2:13:20] word.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Prayer line. No, it's already went on.
[2:13:28] Oh, brother one, I'm expecting a prayer
[2:13:30] line. He's among you right now,
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; and he's going wave after wave after
[2:13:35] wave after wave across you right now.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Roll away the stone.
[2:13:55] Somebody will see me. It don't matter.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Roll away the stone. What? Brother Ron,
[2:14:03] somebody will make fun of me. Roll away
[2:14:05] the stone.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Spirit of God.
[2:14:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Almighty God, I bow my head before you
[2:14:18] now.
[2:14:25] I have delivered the word that you have
[2:14:27] asked me to deliver.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; You are the resurrection and the life.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; You are the breath behind the voice.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; You're the anchor to our soul right now.
[2:15:00] Oh God,
[2:15:03] may life come.
[2:15:08] May life reb breathed across this
[2:15:10] audience.
[2:15:14] It's important that the tent went up and
[2:15:16] it's important that all the music is set
[2:15:18] right and it's important all the helpers
[2:15:20] have did their part.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; It's important that the ministry are at
[2:15:24] their post of duty and the deacons are
[2:15:26] everywhere.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; But God, we didn't come to see one
[2:15:28] another.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; We didn't come to hear some poetic
[2:15:33] words.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; We come that you would come to our tomb.
[2:15:43] of all of the tombs, you went to
[2:15:45] Lazarus's tomb
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; and you've came to our spot tonight.
[2:15:49] You've come to our home. You came to our
[2:15:52] situation as we sit and we listen to the
[2:15:54] word,
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; backsliding,
[2:16:01] habits,
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; situation,
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; unbelief.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Satan, you're a cruel taskmaster and we

[2:16:31] night, another day, another hour.

[2:17:00] infirmities.

[2:25:02] where you are right tonight.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; It's not what you used to do or what
[2:25:08] your hands have done. Is where your
[2:25:09] revival's at right here tonight.

[2:34:23] and made
[2:34:26] me. Let's just sing that last verse
[2:34:28] again.
[2:34:32] Since I met this blessed
[2:34:37] se
[2:34:42] and since he cleansed
[2:34:46] me,
[2:34:52] I shall never cease
[2:34:57] to praise him.
[2:35:01] I shine
[2:35:04] my eternity.
[2:35:12] He touched me.
[2:35:15] Oh,
[2:35:17] he touched me
[2:35:21] and all
[2:35:24] the joy that loves my soul.
[2:35:29] Oh,
[2:35:32] something
[2:35:34] else happened
[2:35:37] and now
[2:35:39] I know
[2:35:43] he touched me.
[2:35:54] How many roll the stone back?
[2:35:57] How many put your hand to the stone?
[2:36:01] You can you can confess it.
[2:36:04] I think when they put their hand to the
[2:36:06] stone, there was a little bit of motion
[2:36:07] that came with that.
[2:36:09] There was something that said, "He's the
[2:36:11] resurrection and the life. He's the one
[2:36:14] that spoke life and Lazarus came." I'm
[2:36:18] sure there was a little bit of
[2:36:19] happiness, a little bit of joy, little
[2:36:22] bit of worship. And it wasn't something
[2:36:25] that had to be told. They saw the dead
[2:36:28] raised up again. They loved Lazarus.
[2:36:32] That was their brother. And I love you.
[2:36:38] And I got a little bit of joy tonight
[2:36:42] because Jesus
[2:36:44] spoke to you
[2:36:46] and told you to roll back a stone.
[2:36:50] and you lifted up your hand and said, "I
[2:36:53] rolled my stone away."
[2:36:55] Well, I wonder whether you could praise
[2:36:57] him.
[2:37:02] I wonder what Mary did. I wonder what
[2:37:04] Martha did.
[2:37:08] I wonder what they did.
[2:37:12] I wonder what kind of meeting they had
[2:37:14] at the that day. I wonder what kind of
[2:37:16] was not looking at the preacher. They
[2:37:18] weren't looking at the people around the
[2:37:20] room. They were looking to the lamb of
[2:37:22] God. They're looking to life himself.
[2:37:26] He spoke the word. And by him speaking
[2:37:28] the word, I got life. I got my brother
[2:37:31] back. Look around the room. I got my
[2:37:33] sister back. Look around the room. I I
[2:37:36] got my brother back. I got my daddy
[2:37:38] back. I got my mommy back.
[2:37:42] Praise the Lord. Why? because the
[2:37:44] resurrection has come by your way.
[2:37:47] Brother Bram said that's what this
[2:37:48] message was all about. The resurrection
[2:37:51] came by your address
[2:37:53] and you received it this evening.
[2:37:56] I just want to give him all the glory.
[2:37:59] Is he the worthy lamb, David? Is he the
[2:38:01] worthy lamb? He's worthy of all praise
[2:38:04] and glory. Worthy, worthy,
[2:38:09] worthy, worthy the lamb.
[2:38:12] Oh worthy.
[2:38:18] So worthy,
[2:38:24] worthy.
[2:38:26] The lamb
[2:38:29] that was slain.
[2:38:34] He's worthy.
[2:38:40] Worthy,
[2:38:45] worthy.
[2:38:47] The lamb
[2:38:50] that was. Let's just sing that chorus
[2:38:53] again. He's so worthy.
[2:39:00] He's so worthy.
[2:39:07] Worthy.
[2:39:09] The lamb
[2:39:11] that was slain
[2:39:17] is worthy.
[2:39:21] My Jesus is worthy.
[2:39:29] Worthy.
[2:39:31] The lamb
[2:39:33] that was slain. Let's just sing it now
[2:39:37] without the musicians.
[2:39:39] He's worthy.
[2:39:45] He's worthy.
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; Worthy.
[2:39:54] The lamb
[2:39:56] that was slain.
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; Worthy.
[2:40:08] Worthy,
[2:40:13] worthy.
[2:40:15] The lamb.
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; Hear the cry. Go ahead, Ryan. Hear the
[2:40:24] cries
[2:40:26] of the shackle.
[2:40:29] From the onset
[2:40:32] of time,
[2:40:35] from the chains
[2:40:38] of defeat, there's no
[2:40:42] key.
[2:40:46] See the tears
[2:40:49] of the broken.
[2:40:52] The cryal
[2:40:54] of the slaves.
[2:40:57] Is there no one
[2:41:01] worthy to set us free?
[2:41:08] And then the crying
[2:41:12] is still
[2:41:14] as the chorus
[2:41:17] rings out.
[2:41:20] The shackles
[2:41:22] are released from their chain.
[2:41:31] and thousands
[2:41:33] of voices
[2:41:36] are.
[2:41:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want my voice to be perfect.
[2:41:44] The lamb that was slain.
[2:41:52] He's worthy.
[2:41:58] Worthy.
[2:42:03] Worthy.
[2:42:06] I am
[2:42:08] that was
[2:42:13] So he's worthy.
[2:42:25] Worthy
[2:42:27] the lamb
[2:42:29] that was.
[2:42:36] Is he worthy?
[2:42:40] Isn't his presence wonderful?
[2:42:47] I'm just looking at different people
[2:42:48] this evening, different men, different
[2:42:52] young ladies that came into the service.
[2:42:56] And the voice of God said, "Roll your
[2:42:58] stone away. Put your hand to that
[2:43:01] stone."
[2:43:04] In your own heart, you know exactly
[2:43:07] what you rolled away by the word of God.
[2:43:12] And there should be something welling up
[2:43:14] within your heart. Lord, how wonderful
[2:43:18] was to be in your presence tonight.
[2:43:21] Not because the minister got excited,
[2:43:24] but there's something that's now beating
[2:43:26] in my soul. And this is a reality.
[2:43:32] I'm free tonight by the word of God.
[2:43:36] I'm free by the words I heard this
[2:43:38] morning, last night,
[2:43:40] day before. I'm I'm free by the word
[2:43:44] that has been spoken.
[2:43:46] And there's a joy unspeakable and full
[2:43:50] of glory that is now welling up within
[2:43:54] my heart tonight.
[2:43:56] I wonder if we rolled back the stone for
[2:43:59] these for these young ladies saying,
[2:44:01] "I'm not I'm not now chained down to
[2:44:04] fashion
[2:44:06] that has bound you so much."
[2:44:10] Young men so influenced by Hollywood
[2:44:13] haircuts
[2:44:15] and all these things that try and entrap
[2:44:18] us to take away our joy.
[2:44:22] and all of a sudden we become imprisoned
[2:44:25] in some sort of tomb that was man-made.
[2:44:29] But I believe that Jesus came by.
[2:44:33] Jesus spoke the word of God and rolled
[2:44:36] back your stone and now life is coming
[2:44:40] forth within your own heart.
[2:44:46] It's not just the deacon or the elder
[2:44:50] young people, but something's happened
[2:44:53] very deep within my heart. You must make
[2:44:57] your confession.
[2:44:59] Say, "My stone's been rolled back. The
[2:45:02] tomb's empty.
[2:45:04] And he's alive within my heart." Can you
[2:45:08] say that? He's alive.
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; He's alive in my heart.
[2:45:16] Let's bow our heads.
[2:45:23] Bow our heads.
[2:45:26] And if you want to give him a
[2:45:29] thanksgiving offering from your hearts,
[2:45:32] you speak to him now. You speak to him.
[2:45:37] You speak to him as he's a father.
[2:45:41] You speak to him with your lips and say,
[2:45:43] "Father, thank you for coming and
[2:45:47] speaking to me. Thank you, Lord.
[2:45:51] Thank you, Lord, that you can thank him
[2:45:54] from your heart."
[2:45:57] Amen.
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you some time that you
[2:46:02] can thank him.
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; Because just in a few more minutes,
[2:46:07] we're just going to be out of the maybe
[2:46:09] this little gathering, out of this
[2:46:11] presence. But Jesus is passing by your
[2:46:13] way. Maybe you just want to thank him
[2:46:15] from the depths of your soul and say,
[2:46:17] "I'm not I'm not going to rob him. I'm
[2:46:20] not going to I'm not going to rob him of
[2:46:21] my thanksgiving. I'm going to praise
[2:46:23] him. I'm going to thank him. I'm going
[2:46:25] to worship him.
[2:46:34] It's a very great secret young people
[2:46:36] that we need to learn is he loves to
[2:46:40] hear. Thank you, Father.
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, I love you.
[2:46:46] You're the worthy one.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; I bless your holy name.
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; I thank you for what you're doing in my
[2:46:54] life.
[2:46:56] Nods are wonderful, but he loves to hear
[2:46:58] your voice.
[2:47:01] He loves to dwell amongst the praise and
[2:47:03] the praise is just a thanksgiving
[2:47:06] from your heart. Heavenly Father,
[2:47:09] how can we say thanks
[2:47:12] for the things that you have done for us
[2:47:15] service after service after service
[2:47:21] tonight Lord very special
[2:47:24] because Lord the word went out and as
[2:47:27] the scripture says it healed the people.
[2:47:30] Heal your people tonight, Lord,
[2:47:35] as they've opened up their hearts and
[2:47:37] opened up their lips of praise and
[2:47:39] thanksgiving. It only takes a moment in
[2:47:43] your presence, Lord. How often your
[2:47:45] prophet said, "Just go rejoicing. Just
[2:47:48] go rejoicing." And they went rejoicing.
[2:47:52] And Jesus said, "Just go believing. Go
[2:47:54] rejoicing." And so Lord, we want to
[2:47:57] rejoice tonight
[2:47:59] that the word of God has been anchored
[2:48:03] deep within our hearts. God, make it a
[2:48:07] reality.
[2:48:08] Make it a substance faith,
[2:48:12] Lord Jesus. It's not just emotion in
[2:48:15] some tent meeting, but God, there's
[2:48:18] something deep within that says, I know
[2:48:20] Jesus came by my way. I know Satan has
[2:48:25] been bound. I know he's been loosed. And
[2:48:28] now I'm rejoicing
[2:48:30] in your goodness, Lord.
[2:48:34] Bless these precious young people. So
[2:48:38] much word has been given.
[2:48:41] So much has been shaken before them.
[2:48:44] Lord, may they learn to respond
[2:48:48] with an open heart
[2:48:51] with a heart of thanksgiving.
[2:48:56] We will linger, Lord, in your presence.
[2:48:58] And as those will go their way,
[2:49:02] would you watch over them on the road?
[2:49:05] Know, Lord, that tomorrow morning at
[2:49:07] 10:00, there will be another service. It
[2:49:11] will be our last service, but it will be
[2:49:13] a service where we can rejoice in the
[2:49:16] goodness of your greatness and of your
[2:49:19] love and of your mercy.
[2:49:22] Would you strengthen your servant
[2:49:24] tonight? He's poured out much. Would you
[2:49:27] pour back abundantly?
[2:49:30] Strengthen him, Lord.
[2:49:33] Father God, bring us back. If there is a
[2:49:35] tomorrow, bring us back Lord, rejoicing
[2:49:39] with a heart of thanksgiving
[2:49:42] in Jesus' name.
[2:49:45] Once my heart and soul was fed.
[2:49:52] Once
[2:49:53] my heart and soul are fed
[2:50:03] by
[2:50:05] the binding chains of sin,
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; but
[2:50:16] the great
[2:50:19] So,
[2:50:24] he set
[2:50:26] me free to worship
[2:50:30] him.
[2:50:33] Oh, glory, glory,
[2:50:37] glory,
[2:50:39] hallelujah.
[2:50:47] Blessed be his holy name.
[2:50:56] He
[2:50:58] the great
[2:51:09] the son
[2:51:11] the redeemer.
[2:51:14] Oh glory, glory, glory,
[2:51:20] glory,
[2:51:22] hallelujah.
[2:51:28] Blessed
[2:51:30] be his holy name.
[2:51:48] And that's
[2:51:50] the song of the redee.
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless his holy name. Bless his holy
[2:51:58] name. Why don't you shake one another's
[2:52:01] hand?
[2:52:03] And why don't you say, "The stone's been
[2:52:05] rolled away.
[2:52:21] God bless you.
[2:52:25] You're dismissed in Jesus name. God be
[2:52:28] with you.
