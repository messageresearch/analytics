Aren't you glad you know him this morning? &gt;&gt; He's here to meet our needs. Hallelujah. I know the master of the way. I know the maker of the rain. Oh, he can calm the soul and make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the way. Sing it one more time. Yes, I know the master of the way. Oh, I know the rain. He can all make the sun to shine again. Oh, I know the master of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to go to prayer at this time. And we ask brother Tony, brother Tony, if you'd come and take these prayer requests for the Lord. I'm going to actually, brother Tony, leave two for you. I just can't pronounce their names. They're overseas, so I'll have you make mention of them. Uh we want to remember brother uh Dave Sanger, pastor in down Philadelphia. He's uh gone to the for emergency surgery this past week and had to be uh remitted to the hospital for complications. Just pray that God's grace will be with him in the second operation. I also Elizabeth Neighbor has a request here. We want to remember uh Joshua Stany who is uh who has ruptured his appendix in Louisiana and pray for the infection, the healing, the fever would be reduced. Apparently, he's been in the hospital for several days. Sister Norma Smith has a testimony here. On Tuesday, I had a stent put in my main artery in my neck. Praise the Lord. Everything went well. Thank you all for your prayers. And uh, Brother Mike Gier has a prayer request here for his boss's son, Jason, who is in a medicalinduced coma, very critical condition. Uh they're just asking prayer for his lungs to clear and that God will use this time to deal with the parents. We want to pray for uh Doris Hayes wanting to be here but having to stay home due to a cold and lung condition. And uh we want to remember please pray for Ron West as he's going in for heart surgery Victoria on Wednesday. I do have one testimony testimony of healing from China. A brother was diagnosed with liver cancer one year ago and testified how the Lord healed him and re healed him after he received the message one year ago. Short shortly after he got saved, he was diagnosed with cancer and his doctors persuade him to take a chemical treatment. He heard of the miraculous healing power in two testimonies of brother Yang's liver cancer who apparently had a funeral uh ready and arranged for him and uh sister fans h hepatitis B. So, this brother refused the chemical treatment but kept going to church. Just last week, he got an all-around physical check and the results came back and the doctors told him that all of his liver functions are normal. I want to thank the Lord for that. [Music] We rejoice in that testimony, God's healing power. Simple faith can bring the master on the scene, can't it? You know, his uh outstanding service on Wednesday with brother Dier, I'm sure you all remember how he just had these words uttered forth from him that God is gathering a cloud of witnesses. You remember that? &gt;&gt; Well, just yesterday, we had another witness go beyond the curtain of time. Another pastor, this is brother Rashid Gil from Pakistan. He was in the pulpit preaching. I couldn't think of a better way to go to step on into eternity than from right behind the sacred desk. Amen. And so while we mourn the loss of our precious brother Rashid in Pakistan and the bride in Pakistan is is mourning his loss, we do not sorrow as others do. For our brother is a part of that great host of witnesses. But we do want to remember the family in prayer today. And also for brother uh Jean Fransis in Mauritius. He is uh diagnosed with a kidney failure. He's also suffering with anemia, but his confession is in the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's join our hearts together in faith this morning. Heavenly Father, you truly are the master of all things. When you were in the boat with the disciples, Father, you were at such peace that you were able to sleep in the midst of a storm, a trial that had been predestinated, oh God, to stir the faith of your disciples for them to be able to recognize that when you are in the boat with us, there's nothing that we have to fear. And Lord, though we may see the storms of life raging about, though we may see how the cancers and demon forces are assailing your bride, Lord, we can think of many this morning, spirits of infirmities that are keeping those from service this morning like our sister Doris. Lord, we rebuke this lung infection and this cold. In the name of Jesus Christ, we rebuke this this spirit of infection that's on this brother Josiah, Lord, down in Louisiana. We pray for him that he also would be able to recognize that the master is in his boat that his master is with him. Oh father, for this one that oh God has recognized a God that is on the scene. And our brother Mike Gier Lord that's what we live for to be a witness to those around us that they may see this power of your presence Lord living within us. And brother Mike's boss Lord having recognized something different about our brother reaches out in faith Lord to ask for prayer for his son Jason. Lord Jesus we don't know all the situation. We don't know why he's in this coma. But Lord Jesus, this man is asked and oh God, Lord, how we're reminded in the scriptures that you when we were invited, you always went to the scene. Lord, this man is inviting you to come on the scene. And may you confirm his prayer desire and this request for your glory, for your honor, Father. Oh Lord Jesus. Lord, we also think of uh Brother Ron West, Lord, who's going in for surgery. We think of the Gil family, Lord, that is mourning the loss of a husband, of a father. How our precious Rashi, Lord, is is held in such high regard and esteem as a minister, as one who has labored in these things. Lord, even having stood behind this pulpit and ministered to us. We pray for the family. We pray for the bride in Pakistan as we see, Lord Jesus, how you're moving on a political scene. how Lord Jesus that Lord God those ones that are under the spirit of Israel's religion oh God are being thrust to the forefront and Lord we know that this is your doing for you raise up kings and you bring them down Lord you're wanting to have oh God a window I believe of a of an entrance of your word into these countries where they have been so rigid and so firmly against the gospel the very lands where the gospel has been 2,000 years ago Lord send forth your word into these countries like Pakistan and where Islam is named. We pray Lord for the peace of these countries that your gospel could go in and comfort the bride in Pakistan Lord as they have lost the Lord apostle of their faith as it were in that country. We pray for brother Jean Franis Lord with this kidney failure and anemia. May you strengthen him. May you deliver him as his confession is in you Lord. other requests for brother David's hanger. We pray you'd touch him as well. And Lord, the unspoken request, Lord, you see each and every heart this morning. Lord God, as we raise our hands in this building, Lord, across the globe, as those who are listening by way of internet or telephone or who may even listen at a later date, Lord, you're not bound by time. You're not bound by distance. You're the everpresent help in a time of need. And Lord, our faith is anchored in you this morning. We've seen too much. We've heard too much like the testimony out of China. Lord, bless and move for your glory. Show your power. Show your presence. And Father, as we come to the order of the ministry of the word, Lord, we've created, I believe, by faith an atmosphere of our worship. Lord, now for the seed to find good ground. Lord, we want our hearts to be open. We don't want to be rigid. We don't want to be cast in our own ideas. Loosen us, Father. Work the ground. And Lord, anoint brother Ed as you would come that that word with life, that word with power, that word with a dynamics that'll change our bodily conditions and our spiritual conditions would come forth over this sacred desk and minister to your bride. As we ask all these mercies in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. [Music] Amen. God bless you. I want to welcome everyone tonight this morning. Used to doing this evening service. Keep saying good night or good evening. But uh God bless you. It's good to have everyone here. If you're on the telephone, hookup or on the internet, we want to say God bless you. I have two announcements uh to make and as I'm doing that, Sister Elizabeth Neighbor and Rhysa Young have a special for us. Why don't you come and get ready at this time? Uh just a note from Jeremy Bergen. Anyone interested in helping to create content for the witnessing website uh presented by Jeremy Bergen should look at the bulletin board. There will be uh various sessions on Saturday and you want to mark this down March 4th for those who want to help. And also there is going to be a young people's choir practice at uh 3 o'clock this afternoon and that's from Sister Linda in a couple minutes here. Why don't we uh why don't we sing uh I forgot actually forgot to write it down. I forgot what it was now. That's all right. Why don't we just sing I Know the Master of the Wind again. I love that song. I know the master of the way. I know the maker of the rain. Oh, he can call and make the sun shine again. I know the master of the wind. [Music] met the man and a woman in a town called Shunam. They'd made a home for Elisha and found favor in his eyes. So God sent them a miracle. the only thing they had longed for. Within a year they would hold a son as Elisha prophesied. One day they ran from the field. They brought the child to his mother. She held his head there on her knee until he died at noon that day. She didn't tell anyone. She ran straight to the man of God. And if anybody asked her, she replied while on her way, "It is well." It is well. [Music] There is peace in my despair, knowing God will hear my prayer, and I will cling &gt;&gt; to the promise that he brings. Even death can have no sting, no power in hell. [Music] In his presence I will dwell where it is well. [Music] Elisha stood by the bedside where she lay the boy when he died and prayed a prayer upon him and he breathed new life again. friend. God doesn't change. If you have that woman's faith, he'll send you a miracle. And until then, you can say, "It is well." It is well. &gt;&gt; There is peace in my despair, knowing God has heard my prayer, and I will cling. to the promise that he brings. Even death can have no sting, no power in hell. &gt;&gt; In his presence I will dwell where it is well. It is well. There is peace in my despair. Knowing God has heard my breath and I will cling &gt;&gt; to the promise that he brings. Even death can have no sting, no power in heaven. &gt;&gt; In his presence I will dwell. I will &gt;&gt; in his presence. I will where it is. Well, [Music] it is well. [Music] It is well. Thank you, sister and sister Elizabeth. We're going to be turning the service at this time to our pastor, brother Red. As he comes, I'd like to sing number 357. Jesus, draw me close. Closer, Lord, to thee. Jesus draw me close closer Lord to you. [Music] Let the world around me. Oh Jesus. [Music] For I desire to worship and [Music] Jesus Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Jesus Christ for Ius. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, let the world around me fade away. Jesus Christ [Music] to you. [Music] I desire to worship and obey. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's my desire today to worship and obey both. Hallelujah. I think worship without obedience is not really a very sincere worship, but we're here to worship and obey, right? Amen. Uh I have a announcement about next Sunday because the youth camp will be taking place uh starting on the on Friday. So on next Sunday, we're we will only have one service and that will be at 11:00. We're hoping that everyone from the uh youth camp will be able to get back in time. They're going to have to start a little bit early and uh to try to be here by that time by 11:00 and then we can just have that one service that day. Uh also want to just let you know that uh you see these two windows up on this side. There's one window here and one around the corner matching this that's over here. We have now uh three translation rooms up there that are now functioning. They're all equipped and wired and our translators are there now. And the fourth one actually is uh is the Chinese and Vietnamese work and they so there'll be there's room for four translators up there uh uh simultaneously. We've made them as soundproof as possible. There's been a tremendous amount of labor that has been involved to do that, but that has uh made it possible. So, Brother Madden or whoever's translating in the Serbian didn't have to go over into Brother Tom's office and brother Murphy goes to my office. And we had little we cubby holes up here years ago where people would, you know, try to uh do that kind of work. But today it's becoming more and more and more important because since the internet the the uh translations take place and then we get the services out to in other languages. Then for some time now I've had a burden and I'm a very very you know very elementary in my technology as far as technology and understanding is concerned but I just asked some I think very fundamental questions and one of the questions I asked people who know a lot more than I do I said now I stand here at the pullpit and the voice goes uh through the microphone and it goes to the server here and it's digitized and it goes to the server at SFU and it goes into their whole system and it goes up to the satellite and they can hear it in some other country providing they understand English. I said, "What what is preventing someone from uh Brother Murphy, for example, I know that soon as he speaks, he's he's he's speaking right now as I speak." And uh and his voice is going onto a onto a computer and it's being digitized. Why can't we send that simultaneously so that anyone who speaks Chinese can hear it anywhere in the world? And uh it was good question. Well, it takes more equipment and more equipment is more expense and all the rest of it. Well, it it looks now and I'd like you just to be holding it in prayer. looks now as though there's been a a commitment to to purchase the necessary equipment and some people really became burdened about it and have taken it upon themselves to let's get that equipment and be able to put I understand perhaps as many as eight languages simultaneously be going onto the internet and you'll be able to share the service with people in many other languages. languages and many other lands. And uh I I just believe if God opens a door for us, we should walk through it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm in very much in favor of that. And I just want to say to all those that have labored and there's many things uh when you come here to church and you sit here and take in a service, believe me, you only see the tip of the iceberg. That's all you see. You just see the tip of the iceberg. There's people who are spending uh not hours, days and weeks and months of their time and and uh much of it is donated and they just give themselves to the ministry. And I say God bless them and God bless all of you who make that possible. Every the scripture tells us that every every joint supply &gt;&gt; and that's exactly what I believe it. every joint supply whatever it is and however we're able to and uh if you don't think you're doing enough don't worry you just keep pressing in and God will have a place for you and God does have a place for you I believe that with all my heart I want to make an announcement about the chapel and that the deacons are here and they can we've discussed this some time ago but we want to have the chapel restricted And only those who are preparing for the current service are to be in the chapel before the services. And musicians and singers who are using the chapel should do so in a in a prayerful uh atmosphere as you're getting ready to come out and serve the people in in worship. And I believe that that's important. In the past, we've uh we've permitted and even encouraged, I suppose, the young people who who play instruments to just play in the chapel while the service has been going on and learn the songs and so on so forth. But we're not going to do that anymore. We during the service, we want any all the all the young people and anyone here in the service. And that's uh that's my my desire. and and uh so I have asked that the the deacons if anyone's in the chapel during the song service and during the service at all they should be in here. You know as soon as you get outside of the walls all the talk and chat and this and that we need to be in here because we don't know what God is going to do and how God is going to deal with you. And so the the chapel will be just for the musicians and the singers that are preparing for the current service, the service that is just coming up. And everyone should be in the sanctuary during the services. Um believe that's everything. I was going to tell you about brother Rashid Gil, but I brother Tony has done so. And we want to remember the family. I don't know how brother how old brother Rashid was, but many of you here remember he has been here on more than one occasion and uh he was a kind of the workhorse in Pakistan and so they would really feel that loss. He was a real workhorse for the message there. Amen. Well, maybe we could just sing the chorus we were singing. If you'd like to stand and we'll get ready. Jesus, draw me close. We get ready for the word this morning. Everyone feel good? &gt;&gt; Amen. You pray for me and pray for yourself. And I'll also pray for everyone here. Jesus strongly close [Music] the world around me. [Music] Yes. Jesus Christ [Music] to you for I desire to worship and obey. Let's join in just once again all together. Jesus Christ. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] I desire to worship. Just before we read, let's talk to the author. Almighty God, you are the author of life, the author of this word we call the Bible. man has put it into a book form, but you are the one that put it into word form. You're the one that spoke it. You inspired the prophets and sages of old to speak. And the word of the Lord does indeed come to the prophet. And we thank you for the messenger we have received in this hour. Lord, I pray that that word that has touched our lives will be ignited again with the winds of the Holy Spirit. Lord, that this will not be a head knowledge, something that we have learned or something that we can repeat, but let it be something that sinks from the womb of the mind down into the soul region. Lord, let it come into that third realm. Let it go beyond any of our emotional being. Lord, I pray going beyond our little material needs. May we see, oh God, those things that you see, may we, oh God, be moved by that which you are moved with. And I pray, Father, today you'll be pleased with the service. Pleased, oh God, with all the efforts, Father, of the people having come. We've gathered together and we've gathered here that we might hear words of thee, Lord. So I pray you'll speak on, oh God, having received, Father, our sincere desires. And now, Lord, anoint us each one. Anoint me as I stand here before the people as they stand and ready to receive now. And I ask, oh God, that you'll remove every obstacle that may be in our way, Lord. every obstacle that may be in the individual way, Lord, and rather than them being preoccupied with what was yesterday or what is tomorrow, remove it in the name of Jesus Christ. And may we now just be focused on this one central focal point and that is your presence with us, making known your word to us. feed the sheep &gt;&gt; and give us strength for the day in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Open up your Bibles if you would please to Revelation the 5th chapter and we're going to read. There's only 13 verses, 14 verses in that uh chapter. And so we'll begin to read, believe, down to verse 10. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book, to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders sth unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nations, and hast made us unto our God, kings, and priests, and we shall reign on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Well, it's no secret and it's well well known that the book of Revelation is a very symbolic book and we certainly I have looked to see what others have said about various aspects of the of even some of the subject matter today. And I can tell you when I was done I just said thank God for a prophet. I tell you, it went from east to west. It went from north to south. It went It went way out to Pluto and back. &gt;&gt; Went all over the map. And I just I I I I just said, "Thank God we have an absolute. &gt;&gt; That makes sense." &gt;&gt; Amen. Actually makes sense. &gt;&gt; But it is a it's certainly an a mystical book. There's another scripture I want to read out of Hebrews 4:13 that says, "Neither is there any creature," we're a lot of creatures here today, "But neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do." And I found it also interesting not to distract you from my main subject as I'm going to introduce in just a moment, but this scripture that says uh that neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and open unto unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. And I found it very interesting the that this the reference to this word do is to whom we have to logos. The word is actually logos which is word. In in other words, God there's nothing hidden from God. It's not what we're doing in activity that he's speaking about here, but it is what we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our faith, our belief in the word. And that's what he's really talking about. I want to speak to you today and all of this will tie together as we move along. I want to speak to you today simply on the lamb of God. I have been taking several services about five on the prophet optics and uh I had a phone call last night matter of fact and uh a brother from way across the nation on the other side of the ocean the Atlantic Ocean called and said our pastor's been speaking on fiber optics. She said, "Then I went in to stream one of your services and I saw you were speaking on prophet optics." And I said, "Well, I that's right. For my part, I I like prophet optics a lot better than fiber optics, you know." But uh so we've been talking about the kind of eyes that God has given, the kind of eyesight that God has given. And uh uh in this in the subject today, the lamb of God, you may wonder how I'm approaching this, but in the Old Testament, I'm going to go right from Genesis to Revelation. In the Old Testament, the lamb was chosen by the person. The man went out and looked and chose the lamb. had to be uh certain had male of the first year and no blemishes on it. So he'd examine it and he'd look at it real well and then he would select the one. The man did the selecting, the man did the doing, the man did the sacrificing, the man he he arranged everything. But I found as I move through the scriptures from Genesis to the lamb that we read about just now this evening, that lamb, that's the one that's doing the choosing. &gt;&gt; He's the one whose eyes we fall under. It's not the man looking anymore. It's the lamb looking. It's the lamb leading. It's the lamb making the selection. &gt;&gt; He did so on earth. and he met Peter and Andrew and James and John and he called them. The lamb was making the selection, not the man anymore. And the the roles turned completely around. And I'm glad they have. And I'm going to speak to you about this lamb, the lamb of God. We start by uh in in Genesis we find that the scripture tells us that God clothed Adam and unto Adam and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them. They don't say the scripture doesn't say whether it was a lamb or what it was. Brother Brandham said it was a lamb. And I'm satisfied it was a lamb because it's been a lamb all the way through the scripture. &gt;&gt; It's also interesting and I I think it's important that I significant that I make this mention at this point that the lamb is mentioned 30 times in the new testament. 30 times is the lamb mentioned in the new testament. Once it is mentioned by the unic that was in his chariot and he was reading the scripture out of Isaiah 53 and he was asking who is he speaking of? Is the prophet speaking of himself or is he speaking of another and Philip then began to declare to him from the same scripture and preach to him of Jesus Christ. That's one time. And the second time it's mentioned uh by uh by Peter and speaking of that we are washed by the blood the precious blood of the lamb. Those are the two times 28 times out of 30 it's picked up by the apostle John. John is the only one who caught John the Baptist saying behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. Not Matthew, not Mark, not Luke, but John for it's it's very significant that John caught into the spirit of Elijah. &gt;&gt; He caught those words. that John the Baptist was speaking, not the others, but somehow John caught it. It was very significant that he should catch it because he was the one that was going to end up on the aisle of Patmas. &gt;&gt; And and there was something significant. There was something about him. There was something about his nature. He he was noticing something. He was catching words that that uh were not as significant to others. And he and he and he says it twice. He says that the only two times John the Baptist that spirit of Elijah making the declaration and the and the scripture tells us by John the Baptist's own declaration of his own self. He said that he who sent him said on whom you see the dove descending the same as he that shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. But when he did see him coming, he didn't say behold he who will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. He uttered a different phrase. Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. And the next day Jesus comes to him again and and John seeing him coming says, "Behold this is he of whom I spake. Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." And something within John said that needs to be scribed. That's something that must not be forgotten. That's something the spirit of God within him declaring that this is something that has to be recorded for all time &gt;&gt; because there's a transition taking place now. This lamb now was going to have a different role. This lamb was going to be presented to the world differently than all the lambs of the past. And furthermore, when this lamb was being sacrificed, God's lamb on Calvary, when he was being sacrificed, all other lambs were dismissed &gt;&gt; and done away with &gt;&gt; at the coming of this lamb. &gt;&gt; Tell you, it's something here to be sitting here today and feel the sense of that assurance. I have been called by this lamb. I have come under the eyesight of this lamb. And this lamb doesn't just look on the outside, but he looks down into the inside of my very being and can say there's no blemish. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's no blemish because I have paid the price for this one that I am selecting. What a glorious thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Eden in the message fellowship, the prophet said, "If God met a man and upon the basis of his faith under the shed blood, save the first man, Adam, he has to forever remain under the same program." He said, "God chose a place called Adam and Eve and shed the blood of an innocent one and covered them with the substance of that innocent one." Covered them with the substance of that innocent one with the blood upon them. That was the basis that man could talk to God and hear his word and get his word was under the shed blood. Adam and Eve did not need covering for God's part. God's eyes are eyes that a piece of skin upon them to hide their shame when they became knowledge became aware that they were naked. He didn't need they didn't need covering for God's but they needed to hide their own shame. And the very fact that God took substance and clothed them speaks clearly that something was lost. When God clothed them, it's a making a declaration something was lost. An innocence was lost. And an innocent one would be directly involved by restoring what they had lost. Now, the very first time that the word lamb is uttered in the Bible, I believe these things are significant. They're very significant to me and they bless me and I think they will bless you. The very first time that the word lamb is uttered in the Bible is by Isaac. a perfect type of Christ. And he's on his way up the mountain to be sacrificed. And he's carrying the wood as the one who he's reflecting Christ who will carry his cross. And he's walking up the mountain and he says, "My father," yes, my son says, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where's the lamb?" First time it's uttered in the scripture. That whole program of God is so precise, friends. It's so precise. &gt;&gt; Don't we rejoice in it? Isn't that marvelous that the type of the lamb would be the first one who would ask, "Where is the lamb?" &gt;&gt; He knew he wasn't the lamb, but there must be one. &gt;&gt; And I love the second time it comes out of the father's mouth. God will provide himself a lamb. Can't we say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see that spirit moving all the way. Almighty God himself having clothed his children. Now s some centuries have gone by and it's never been mentioned not in holy rit but here comes the young man who is of perfect type of Christ bearing his cross and where is the lamb. &gt;&gt; God will provide himself a lamb. &gt;&gt; So you can see the stage is already being set &gt;&gt; so beautifully. The picture so marvelous and God is making it so abundantly clear what his program is. Where is the lamb for a burnt offering? My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering. So they went both of them together. Then we move on. The spirit and power of Elijah was prophesied by the angel to be upon John the Baptist. We've taken a quantum leap now from Genesis to Luke's gospel to John's gospel and the spirit and power of Elijah because the Old Testament closes out. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet, and he will, now it's closing out, and he will restore the hearts of before the great and terrible day of the Lord, and he will restore the faith of the the heart of the children. He'll turn them back to the faith of the fathers and the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers. But in Luke's gospel when the angel came, he's making reference now to a forerunner to Christ's coming. And he shall go before him. This forerunner shall go before Christ in the spirit and power of Elijah or Elias to turn the heart and he needs the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just and to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. So now John the Baptist, he related these instructions concerning Jesus given to him by God. And this is what he said. and I knew him not, but that he but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, upon whom you shall see the spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. Now, this is a direct word of God to John the Baptist who now was anointed with the spirit of Elijah, the spirit and power of Elijah to deliver this message. And I knew him not. But when John the Baptist saw him coming, I'm repeating this, but it needs to be repeated. When John the Baptist saw Jesus coming towards him, he cries out, "Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world." Now the spirit and power of Elijah is upon this servant, this forerunner to utter what needs to be said. And so he utters out. He makes no reference to this is the one that's going to baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire. But he says, "This is he. This is the lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. That is a staggering statement. &gt;&gt; How can any man stand on the bank of a river and point to another man, obviously a human, and say, "This is the man. Behold, this is the lamb of God." Such a phrase has never been spoken. They don't even know what that phrase means. They don't know the depth of it. This is the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the whole world. &gt;&gt; I can tell you friends that is a we we know these phrases. We hear it from childhood. But to hear that for the first time, there's nobody could grasp that. &gt;&gt; The man who said it, I doubt if he knew the depths of it himself. It was just something moving within him. But there's another one standing there. and John the Apostle and he catches that. &gt;&gt; What he's really catching is the spirit and power of Elijah, &gt;&gt; catching a hold of it. &gt;&gt; He caught it. &gt;&gt; And I just rejoiced. I said, "Oh, God, there's another group of people that may not know a whole lot of things, but we have caught into the words and the spirit and the power of Elijah. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we've caught his statements. We caught the words and they have so deep they marked us indelibly they branded our minds and we can't get rid of it. We can't shake it. It's part of our life. It's part of our what we what we breathe and what we eat. It's part of us. &gt;&gt; We have got the spirit and power of Elijah. &gt;&gt; And it is a power. &gt;&gt; It's an absolute power. It's not some waffle dish rag spineless thing and marshmallow can't stand up. It is a spirit in power. &gt;&gt; And I can say to John the Apostle someday, God blessed you, John. I God allowed me to see that one day and I rejoice. You caught it. I caught it. And I fellowshipped with a lot of other people that caught it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we want to follow this Apostle John now because he's actually going to relate a transition of the lamb. John the Baptist introduced him, but it's really the Apostle John who depicts and describes this transition from the little lamb that was a an animal out in the field and typed through the scripture. But now he's going to take and describe this transition, incredible transition of this lamb, the lamb of God. We want to follow the apostle John through some of the experiences that God gave gave in preparing for his most important time of his life which I believe when he would write his visions giving the world the book of revelations. The Apostle John caught that spirit of Elijah and thus was the only one that identified the Lord Jesus as the lamb of God. Only John. Now he was one of the four protectors. We concluded last Sunday on the four protectors. the word. It's not that it's not that Jesus needed to be protected as the as David. I'm sorry. Peter took his sword and was going to protect the Lord Jesus. And Jesus said, "Put up your sword. &gt;&gt; They that live by the sword, they'll die by the sword." I don't need that kind of protection. &gt;&gt; But the kind of protection that Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, they recorded what he said. &gt;&gt; They recorded what he did. and they could declare this truly was the son of God. &gt;&gt; He did what no other man did. He spoke what no other man spoke. Never a man spake like this man. This indeed was none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. And the and the scripture follows through in continuity. And then those four which were around him, they reported they recorded his life, the record of his life. And it's here in the book. This is this is the book that was sealed. Brother Brandon refers to it as the Bible. &gt;&gt; And the seals also well, we won't get into it, but he said that the seals at the time when the seals are revealed or made known, seven thunders uttered their voice. And John the Apostle was going to take up his pen and write and he was instructed write them not. Brother Brandham says now the seals are one thing and the thunders are another. And a lot of people in the message get confused because they say oh well they take the seals the the seals are the seals book that have been spoken now and say well that's not the thunders. The thunders are something else. Oh that's another great revelation coming. No that's not it at all. The seals the seals are the symbol that sealed sealed the uh sealed the truth. &gt;&gt; The the the seal the symbol sealed it. Said he saw you know four horse riders and the first one was the first one was white and the next one was red and the next one was black and the next one was pale. No, nobody knows what that is. And that was the symbol that sealed the truth. And then one day, God would take and loose the seal. And the voice that loosed it was a thunder. &gt;&gt; And so the thunder revealed that the symbol sealed it. It's just that simple. &gt;&gt; And so in the opening of the seals, and then God has now another one in the spirit and power of Elijah &gt;&gt; to catch the revelation &gt;&gt; that the spirit and power of Elijah had announced would come. And so we want to follow John who caught this. It's only John, one of the four protectors. He's the only one that saw Jesus and identified him as a lamb that taketh away the sin of the world. I think that's an outstanding statement. Now the same spirit and power of Elijah speaking the word of the Lord before the dreadful day of the Lord before the dreadful day of the Lord. Turning the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers. So the children hear and are catching that same spirit. Not just not just one or two, but the spirit the children are catching the spirit of Elijah as it speaks forth the words of God. I can see John as an example. I'm I'm I'm I'm laboring on this just a wee bit. I want you to just keep your attention focused, please. The next day, John see Jesus coming to him. That's John the Baptist. And saith, behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world. This is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me. And now it'll be John. I want you to see him as one of the protectors. There were cherubams in Eden that turned every way with a flaming sword. Not protecting the way of life, protecting, not protecting the tree of life, but protecting the way. &gt;&gt; Adam lost his way. &gt;&gt; This generation has lost their way. &gt;&gt; They don't know. And if it wasn't for the word of God, if it wasn't for the message of the hour, we wouldn't know how to do even some very elementary things. Have you got that? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't know hardly how to dress, wouldn't know how to live, wouldn't know how to speak, wouldn't know how to worship, wouldn't know how to do hardly anything. And so the these protectors have always been around the word. I don't know if I can say it just clearly the way someone has said it, but they said that the the center of the world is Israel and the center of Israel is Jerusalem and the center of Jerusalem is the temple and the center of the temple is the holy of holies and the center of the holy of holies is the ark and the center of the ark is the word. &gt;&gt; And I think that's very well put. &gt;&gt; It is the center. &gt;&gt; It's the focal point. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God's eyes, &gt;&gt; his eyes are on that word. &gt;&gt; And it shall be fulfilled. And so John, I see him, not Matthew, not Mark, not Luke, but John. He he has to he has to protect it from one side. And this side is that this one that's coming must be identified as the lamb of God. It that must not slip by and not be kept. It must not be recorded. Look how significant this is to us. And it's only in the New Testament by John outside of the book of Revelation is the only two times the lamb is identified. And here's this apostle John now with a spirit that's upon him standing there is at where and John the Baptist seeing this man coming and John catching that it's as though he took that flaming sword as it were and said that must be held that must be protected the people of the earth must know the redeemed must know this is the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and it shall be declared It shall come down through all the centuries and you people here today shall hear it. Not just read it as a statement in a book, but you will you will also participate in the spirit that he caught a hold of. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was only John, Peter, and James that were permitted by Jesus to come into the into the room where Jesus raised the daughter of Gyrus from the dead. And the Bible even says, "And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter and James and John." Peter was not one of those protectors. James was not one of those protectors, but John was, and he needed to be there. And he and the Bible says they put them all out and would allow no man to be with them but Peter, James, and John. Apostle John walked with this lamb up the mount of transfiguration and a Peter recorded it and he said for he received from God the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount The Apostle John needed to be there on the Mount Transfiguration. And on the Mount Transfiguration, John saw the rehearsal of the coming of Jesus Christ. You see how he's being prepared and trained. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; And the prophet said in Revelation chapter 4 in that series, he said over in this place, then he saw the coming or the rehearsal. The first thing he saw in the coming was Moses represented the dead saints that would be resurrected. And that's all the six ages that they slept six a six church ages. Not only that, Elijah was there, the messenger of the last day with his group. So now here's John. He's caught the spirit of Elijah, the spirit and power of Elijah coming out of out of John the Baptist. And now he's one that's chosen to go up in the mount. He sees the dead girl raised from the dead. There's no mistake in his mind that this indeed is a different lamb of God. &gt;&gt; This is different from anything he's seen. He sees the dead raised. And now he goes up in the mount transfiguration and the prophet and spirit of Elijah in this day catches it. Says the first thing John saw was Moses. Then he saw Elijah. What an experience that must have been. And he's recording it. And he says, "Not he saw Elijah, the messenger of the last day, with his group or the transfigured, the raptured." So he when he saw Moses, that was all asleeping. When he saw Elijah, that was all the the ones who be changed and raptured. There there's the Apostle John. He's looking at the resurrection and the rapture all on the mount. &gt;&gt; Oh. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I hope you're staying with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's looking at Jesus glorified. &gt;&gt; So, he sees them that lived and died. He sees them that lived and were changed. And he sees he sees Christ glorified. He sees all of it right there. And the prophet how he brought out that he saw the whole cycle of life. The whole cycle of life was there. There they were as as mortal beings. There was Moses representing the sleeping. There was Elijah representing those that are changed and and raptured. And there's Jesus in the glorified state which all of us will come to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The whole cycle was there on the mountain. &gt;&gt; And that's why he said and he took them. He said, "Some of you will not taste death till you will see the son of man coming in his glory, in his power. the kingdom of God coming. They saw the kingdom of God, my brother, my sister, that is the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Here we are as mortals, but we're in the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God comes not by observation, but it's within you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some have slept. Some have gone the way of the ground. They're in the kingdom of God represented by Moses on that day. Some have been translated and they re are represented by Elijah. And Jesus stood there representing all of us. For we shall be glorified. We shall have a body like unto his glorious body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you don't want that body, you can just have the one you have. &gt;&gt; You can have whatever choice you want. But as far as I'm concerned, it's that glorified body that I desire. &gt;&gt; That's we're living for. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said they saw the rehearsal of it. &gt;&gt; John along with James his brother and Peter were taken further into the garden than any others. Jesus went into the garden and the Bible says that he took them further. James, John his brother, John and James his brother and Peter brought them further into the garden, brought them further into his experience when actually the spirit would leave him and they would see that moment. Perhaps they couldn't see it physical with their physical eyes, but they would see him come into that agony. And the Bible says then that he left them and went just a short distance, just a little distance, and he fell. And Apostle John, Peter and James witnessed that and saw that agony and that expression and perhaps looking up, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death." He says to them, "Try ye here. &gt;&gt; Wait with me." John had that pull. &gt;&gt; Terry here and he went a little further and fell. Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, not my will, thine be done. &gt;&gt; I tell you, John saying this is a different lamb. I don't know perhaps everything that John the Baptist was alluding to or what he was referring to, but this is like nothing other, nothing else that has ever I could possibly experience what I'm experiencing now. And John was to witness the crucifixion of Jesus and he was struck by something and he's the only one that caught it. A bone of him shall not be broken. He's still on the lamb. &gt;&gt; He's still that that has consumed him &gt;&gt; that he's caught that &gt;&gt; and he's the only one. And he's he he's there at the crucifixion and and and he records and then then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first because they had been instructed the Jews. Therefore, because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day, for that Sabbath day was the high and high day, high holy day. They besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. And John, only John, not Matthew, not Luke, not Mark. He says, "And then came the soldiers, and they break the legs of the Pharisees, watching it, and of the other which was crucified with him. And when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already." And they break not his legs. But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forth with came out their blood and water. And he that saw it, speaking of himself, I saw it, &gt;&gt; and I bear record. and his record is true. &gt;&gt; And he knoweth that he saith is true, and that you might believe. If there'd be anybody here that would dare doubt this, I would say there's no hope for you. You are hellbound. If you deny this record, he's recording the testimony of the lamb of God. And he says, "For these things were done." He says, "My record is true." &gt;&gt; And these things were done that the scripture might be fulfilled. That spirit that was on him caught back into the Old Testament, just a a vague scripture, as it were. And that the scripture might be fulfilled. A bone of him shall not be broken. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only one that caught it. &gt;&gt; He caught the scripture of the Old Testament &gt;&gt; from Moses in Numbers 9 and 12. They shall leave none of it until the morning. Speaking of the sacrificed lamb, the Passover lamb, they shall leave none of it till morning, nor break any bone of it. Can you imagine two, four, six words? Here's a man. He's viewing a crucifixion. He's viewing a most uh brutal killing of a man called Jesus Christ. And he's caught up in it. He's a follower of it. He's a disciple. He's given all. He's left his trade. He's left his business. He's left his family. And it all seems to be crashing down on him in this incredible moment. But that spirit of God is so faithful. And that spirit that was on him and that spirit that's in you will direct you even to six words if necessary. &gt;&gt; And you'll know this is it. &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to speak volumes and books and encyclopedias to the believers. He simply says sometimes one word come. and that's enough. &gt;&gt; Forsake &gt;&gt; where you have been. Repent and that's enough. Be filled with the spirit and that's enough. Be baptized in water for the for the b for the remission of sins and that's enough. &gt;&gt; You don't have to keep babying us along and telling us along. And then John, he sees this great sight that he's seeing and he notices here comes the soldiers. It's a high holy day. Here they come. The leaders are saying break their legs. You know why? Do young people know why they broke the legs. Because death of crucifixion is by asphixxiation. They hang. And I've described this before, but there's always young ones growing up. They hang nailed by their hands and their feet are nailed. And when their feet are nailed, their knees are slightly bent. You'll see all the all the images of the crucifixion. You'll see their knees are slightly bent. In some cases, they put a block under the feet and then they put a spike through both feet, crossed over. And that was because after you hang the ligaments and the muscles tear from the chest and the diaphragm comes up and the breathing gets shorter and shorter and they can't get a breath. And so when they can't get a breath, they straighten their legs and they can breathe for a few moments. And when that is too painful and they hang back down and they get their breath is hard pain hard to come and they stand up and they go down and they stand up and that is that long suffering of the cross and finally says well tomorrow is the high holy day and we don't want them to be on the cross. they must come down and so take and break their legs so they cannot stand up anymore and catch their breath. Go and break their legs. And so John is there. He know what happened. He sees them break the legs of the first one and go over to the second one on the other side and break the legs of that one. Then they come to Jesus and he's already given up the ghost. &gt;&gt; It is finished. The lamb of God. &gt;&gt; No man taketh my life from me. Said I g lay it down and I will take it up again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he gave it. Did he not? &gt;&gt; Did he give it? &gt;&gt; And it came back. &gt;&gt; He raised it up again. Did he not? Amen. &gt;&gt; And that spirit that's on you right now, this moment, left him when he was hanging on that wooden cross. Do you realize that? Right from the cross, that spirit went from the cross, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; and came down &gt;&gt; into you &gt;&gt; and into the church. &gt;&gt; And we are recipients of that spirit today. &gt;&gt; That spirit that you have, that Holy Spirit left him at the cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit of life, &gt;&gt; the token, &gt;&gt; that I've been speaking about, &gt;&gt; the token left him. And now God's eyesight, prophet optics, looks for that life within the believer. And that's that's why it says all things are manifest in his sight. &gt;&gt; He doesn't look at how we're dressed this morning. That's not important to him. He doesn't look at how your hair is combed or any of these other things that are so important to our friends and colleagues and associates, but he looks down into the heart. He sees the heart. I don't have to try to see it. He sees it. &gt;&gt; And everything's like an open book before him. And quite frankly, I love those kind of optics. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he sees it. sees my mistakes, &gt;&gt; sees our errors, but he sees our desire. We have no desire for the world. We have no desire for this corruption. We have no desire to continue in this in this life, the direction it's going. Our life and our desire is for eternal things. &gt;&gt; Amen. And for whatever reason, and John recorded this, I don't know the reason, but for whatever reason, Peter decided to ask Jesus about this man, John. And Peter seeing him, seeing John who he's walked with, they've been disciples together. They've gone through everything together. But he sees him and some somehow he becomes curious and he says, "Lord, what shall this man do?" Just even in Peter, there must have been something. What is it about John? He got to lay his head on your bosom. He's he's considered the beloved disciple. But there was no animosity within Peter. But he was curious. What shall this man do? And Jesus says, if I will that he tar till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then went the saying abroad because it's very common amongst the believers. something is said and then everybody draws a conclusion and are off base. Then went the word around, oh, John's not going to die. This disciple's not going to die. Yet Jesus did not say unto him, he shall not die. But if I will that he tar till I come, what is that to thee? &gt;&gt; The big thing here is not whether he dies or doesn't die. The big thing here is it's none of your business. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go out and serve God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So many things we curious people &gt;&gt; and curiosity always killed thee. &gt;&gt; We're not curious about things we like to know, but a lot of it we don't need to know. What is that to thee? &gt;&gt; Follow thou me. &gt;&gt; That's what's important. Right. &gt;&gt; But John, he was curious about that. And somehow now we see, and stay with me closely because I must move quickly. We see John carried for the testimony of Jesus Christ. He's put on the aisle of Patmas. That was God's will. And then on the aisle of Patmas, he's caught into the spirit. He's standing there in the ground, but he's caught in the spirit and he said, excuse me, and he was took away into heaven and foraw all the things that God promised and said to the disciples. He said, "What is that to you if he terries till I come?" He said he saw he saw the coming of the Lord and what would take place. He saw on earth what would take place on earth to the rapture of the church and was taken up, excuse me, and was taken up and shown plum up plum on down even to past the millennium. &gt;&gt; He said it was the Lord's day. He said he was in the spirit in the Lord's day. And so many people mistake, you know, oh, he was in, you know, just having some kind of an emotional experience. Had nothing to do with that. He was carried forward to the Lord's day. And he saw exactly John was carried in the spirit over into the Lord's day. And this is the day of man, but the day of the Lord shall come. and on down through the scriptures, we'll find that he was in the Lord's day, caught up in the spirit and taken over to the Lord's day. Now, friends, the reason why the reason why I I I felt so inspired to bring you through John's life now, we are here and he's on the aisle of Patmas. I think it doesn't take very much mental power to realize God prepared him for this moment. &gt;&gt; He was a prepared vessel. And John's first sight of this lamb includes a great deal of symbolism. A great deal. And and in the in the breach, brother Brandham says, "How can Jehovah see anything but that bloody lamb standing there?" And the lamb proceeded out into the vision. Now, here's John. And this isn't long afterwards. He said, "All these visions took place within two years." And then John now, he's the one that stood and heard John the Baptist behold the lamb of God that stuck with him. Saw him at the cross. Saw him saw the piercing. Saw the blood. The one I said is a lamb. Here he is bleeding. Sees and hears the words. Sees him come in to break the legs. And he knows the Passover lamb must not have broken legs. And he catches it. Says, "Not a leg of him shall be broken." And he sees it. It's anchored in his heart. And God has prepared him. That spirit that's upon him has prepared him all down all down through the the the the months and very short period of time. And now he's a he's on the aisle of Patmas and he hears this voice great voice and he turns around to see who it is and he's caught in the spirit to the Lord's day. But he says that the lamb advancing from glory for intercessions to make claims now for his redemption. He said the lamb he's bleeding. He's he's shaking. He's been in battle. &gt;&gt; He's been an intercession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad. He's been an intercession for us before the father. And he has power, but he couldn't have power till he shed the blood. &gt;&gt; The blood was his power. &gt;&gt; He had to become a sacrifice before he had any power because it was the shedding of his blood that proved that he was the kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; An angel could not take that place. Another man born by sex could not take that place. When the book when someone to open the book was being searched for, the prophet says Elijah was standing there. &gt;&gt; Elijah could do nothing. Moses was standing there. They could do nothing. And then he says, and they said, "Sir, heaven, this lamb had not been seen before." &gt;&gt; And then he said he he begins to approach and he comes into John's vision. Oh, I wonder what an experience that was for John. And he sees this lamb approaching. He says, "Where's he been?" He's been back in the eternities. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Making intercession, knowing I'm going to redeem the earth. &gt;&gt; I'm going to redeem the world. &gt;&gt; And as a lamb, while a while a man the sinner in the Old Testament went searching for his lamb, now the lamb comes searching for the sinner. Amen. &gt;&gt; What eyes? &gt;&gt; What a lamb. While that one was helpless, this one has power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the lamb advancing to him out of glory. And the scripture which we read which now I focus on. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, the four protectors, and in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb, not seated at the right hand of the majesty on high, but he stood. And the word that the Apostle John has used, he stood. He's standing because he's there to establish something. The word is to bid to stand in the presence of others and even before judges. He's standing there getting ready to take a book &gt;&gt; that cannot be taken by anyone else. And the contents of the book and my brother, my sister, if you're not in this book, you'll never be there. &gt;&gt; This book isn't only a record of his life. It's a record of my life because his life is in the believer. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; His life is in you. &gt;&gt; If it's not in you, you have no part of heaven. &gt;&gt; But when he went to claim that book, because part of it, part of it was lost. I'm going to regain the inheritance. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to establish it. gonna make a people that can stand before them not only judges but they judge. &gt;&gt; And has passed from judgment unto life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word he used was to make firm. He stood and the purpose of his standing. He's going to take a book and he's going to make the people who are written in that book solid, established, firm. Amen. &gt;&gt; Make them so they can stand before any judge. &gt;&gt; Make them so they can stand under the scrutiny of the most uh uh the eyes that have the greatest insight &gt;&gt; that no one can find a fault. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In them &gt;&gt; and we're manifest before the sight of him with whom we have to do. &gt;&gt; With whom we have speak, to whom our testimony is. Oh, I hope you're able to follow me, friends. And he's standing to make firm, to fix, to establish. But listen to this. He now stood. Brother Brandham has said he's standing. He makes a point of it to cause a person to keep his place. &gt;&gt; Let get down to our address. &gt;&gt; Amen. In case you ever have a feeling, in case you ever have something within you that is trying to draw you aside to cool off your experience, to make you think it's not worth it to live some kind of laxidasical or even backsliden life. You remember, you remember. And don't forget that a lamb stood one day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not for himself, for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He stood there for the purpose that you shall not be moved. Amen. &gt;&gt; He stood there to claim a book and your life is in the book. He he he took that book not just to claim it but to establish &gt;&gt; to fix &gt;&gt; the life of every person who was recorded in that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's not going to lose any of his life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have three children that are all here this morning. as a human father. As a father, do you think for one second I could I could choose between one of those and say one of you go to hell and two of you go to heaven or one I have a I have a choice here. I want this one to go go with me and be with me forever and ever and the two of you are going to go into annihilation and go into suffering and go into hell. &gt;&gt; How could I as a human ever have that in my heart? Right. &gt;&gt; All that the Father hath given me shall come. &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice &gt;&gt; and I will lose none of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the lamb I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; That's the lamb that stood there. And whenever that slippery old subtle devil comes to you and suggest you can't make it, you just tell him a lamb of God bleeding, shaking. He's been in battle, but he won the victory and he stood there for me. &gt;&gt; And there's no way you can have me. &gt;&gt; There's no way you can claim me. And there's no way I'm going to destruction. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let us just rejoice. &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all of our praise. He's worthy of all of our praise. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he stood &gt;&gt; it also the same Greek word is has direct reference to the balances where they used to weigh the money and he's declaring when he stood I have the value. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have the purchase price and I'm laying it down now. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's settled for time and eternity. I'm one who had the blood. &gt;&gt; The newly created blood of God &gt;&gt; and I have I have paid the price. &gt;&gt; I have weighed it out in the balances and my children are paid for. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Listen friends, go out of this place today rejoicing. The invoice is stamped paid. &gt;&gt; The debt is stamped paid. &gt;&gt; The mortgage is invalid. &gt;&gt; Our land stood for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said it's paid. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I carried the price. Amen. &gt;&gt; When John saw him, I'm going to be closing with this. It's a little lengthy, but I'm going to close with this. When John saw him, this lamb was indeed different because he said, "I saw this lamb stand and he stood as as it had been slain and he had seven horns." not two, but he had seven horns because horns always speak of power. This lamb now is not some little timid thing that would go out to the pasture to that the man would get. But this lamb has power and who can know his power? He he's got power and perfection. Seven seven horns. &gt;&gt; And which seven horns and seven eyes. Who can escape this kind of eyesight? Seven eyes, perfection in in vision. And they are the seven spirits of God sent forth sent forth into all the earth. Listen friends, we have come under &gt;&gt; the influence of this power &gt;&gt; and we have come under the vision of these eyes &gt;&gt; in the dialogue. I read it also last week. And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living ones, and in the midst of the elders a little lamb standing as if it had been killed, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. And now follow it very close. Brother Brham gives this absolute clarity. He takes it from Revelation 3:1, which says, "These things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the seven stars." The one who held the seven stars in his hand. Revelation 1 says, "And he hath he hath the seven spirits of God." Once again, as in the previous four ages, the spirit is revealing our gracious Lord to us by setting forth his wonderful attributes. This time he is standing in the midst of the church. We see him as the one with the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. He said this same phrase is found four times in the book of Revelation. Revelation 1:4 from the spirit from the seven spirits which are before his throne. Revelation 3:1 these things sayith he that hath the seven spirits. Revelation 4 and5. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunders, thunderings and voices, and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. Now, he's enlarged on it a wee bit. There are seven seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. And finally, Revelation 5 and 6, which we read today. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. That's the four times it is spoken of. He said to begin with, we know of certainty that these verses are not teaching a new contrary doctrine to John 4:24. God is one. God is a he said one spirit. God is a spirit. But this is like 1 Corinthians 2:12, I'm sorry, 8-11, wherein we find one spirit, one spirit manifesting himself in nine different ways. Thus we know that the seven spirits of God mean it is one spirit, one same spirit coming forth in a sevenfold manner. Seven spirits, one spirit coming forth, he says it sent forth into all the earth. So it's sent in a sevenfold manner. &gt;&gt; Now in Revelation 4:5, these same seven spirits are called lamps of burning, which I I repeated that once for you because brother Brandon makes a point here. Now they're called lamps of burning, which are the seven spirits before the Lord. So since John always used nothing but Old Testament symbols in the revelations because that's all they had was the Old Testament. So he used the Old Testament. He drew on it when they break the legs. He only has the Old Testament. And so we go to the Old Testament and find in Proverbs 20 and 27 that the spirit of man, the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord. These seven spirits are found to be associated with man. John the Baptist in John 5 and35 was called a burning light which should actually be translated as burning lamp. Again in Revelation 5 and 6, the seven spirits are identified as seven eyes in Zechariah 4 and10. Are you staying with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; For who hath despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubabel with those seven. They are the eyes of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is very evident that the word they refers to men. Thus we see that the eyes of the Lord in th this instance are men. Of course they will be anointed men full of the Holy Ghost for God's ministries are not in the power of men but in the Holy Ghost. And putting our scriptural discoveries together, it is evident that the seven spirits of God refer to the continuous ministry of the same Holy Spirit in the lives of seven men with whom God identifies himself very closely. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said they are his eyes and they are his lamps. &gt;&gt; And we say praise be to God. How thankful we are that God has sent such a clear message. &gt;&gt; And no wonder, no wonder, no man on earth could speak these things. It was the lamb that spoke them. &gt;&gt; It was the lamb &gt;&gt; that stood and took the book. It was the lamb himself, this lamb, that delivered it to the messenger of this age. Outside of that, he would be helpless. outside of that he would know nothing about it. Even in the breach, he says, "Tomorrow, tonight is the is the first seal." He said, "I don't know one thing about it." &gt;&gt; And he was humble. Came to the pulpit saying, "I would have made the most horrible mistake if he hadn't come to me today and told me exactly what it was." I thank God for that kind of voice. And I thank God for this beloved lamb &gt;&gt; that stood and took my life and took yours. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? And I hold this Bible. He took your life, my brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; regardless of what you think about it or the failures or all the rest of it. He took your life &gt;&gt; and he was not ashamed &gt;&gt; and he took it. Do you hear me? He took it and said, "I'm not ashamed of them in spite of their sin, in spite of their wrongs, in spite of their weakness. And they are mine and I have bought them. &gt;&gt; I had the price and I'm standing to fix them solid and to take them and bring them to myself." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thank for the record of Apostle. I'm thankful to God today for the Apostle John. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that God prepared him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And how I rejoice today &gt;&gt; that we have caught the words of Elijah. &gt;&gt; And not just words, friends, the spirit and power of Elijah. &gt;&gt; We have caught into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh, what a &gt;&gt; what a glorious thing this is. &gt;&gt; I hope that you can just rejoice in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I I I just concluding with this phrase. All of this has is power to the people. &gt;&gt; They like to say that in politics. &gt;&gt; Power to the people. My goodness, they get a they get elected and forget you even exist. But this &gt;&gt; this one here, this lamb did not forget that you existed &gt;&gt; and he transferred the power to the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they overcame him &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb &gt;&gt; and by the word of their testimony. And number three, they loved not their lives unto death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They overcame him. Who are they? Here we are. Who are they? Are you here? They overcame him. &gt;&gt; There isn't a thing him is the devil himself. &gt;&gt; That old dragon, the devil, that serpent that slithered into Eden cannot deceive this bride. That's what Elijah's spirit has said. And I catch the spirit and power of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Who got that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And he said, "He deceived Eve, but he won't deceive this one." &gt;&gt; How could Jesus have paid this price standing before the throne? How could he ever pay this price and see in the end time at the final conclusion the same devil comes and and pollutes his wife? Not a chance. Not a chance. I say not a chance. There's no way this bride can be deceived. There's no way he can corrupt this bride. No way he can do it. &gt;&gt; Not because we're great, because he's great. &gt;&gt; The lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, look to the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Isn't he glorious, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're loving you tonight. This morning, rather. We're loving you. &gt;&gt; We're here, Lord. My heart is filled. Just filled overflowing. I wish Lord would would be as though we'd have all day. We could just sit and speak about these things and different ones could give their testimony of how this lamb sought them out. Oh, we bless your name. We bless your name, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the midst of the people, we bless your name. My Lord Jesus, receive the praise from our lips. Feeble as it might be, we're here to praise you. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Glory. Glory God. &gt;&gt; Receive our thanksgiving &gt;&gt; for the sacrifice of your lamb. &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we? Maybe we can sing. We bless your name. We bless your name. We do that. And you you you sing it like you're singing the same like you saw the same scene that John saw. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I saw a lamb standing shaking, bleeding, came out of the eternities where he made intercession. Interceded for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't feel worthy of it. &gt;&gt; interceded for you and me. &gt;&gt; We bless your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm bit of a fanatic here this morning. I don't know if you're enjoying it, but I am enjoying it. &gt;&gt; It just suit me fine if this is our last service and we're all going home &gt;&gt; today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Brother David is a been a glorious life, hasn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. &gt;&gt; I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you praise. Yeah. Heat.

We defy those chains. [Applause] Defy those chains. Would you do it? Is there something trying to bind you? Tell that enemy, you have no power. You have no claim on me now. We defy those chains. That's not just some way timidly resisting it, but it's rising up knowing the price that has been paid. The incredible victory of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Oh, my friends, my believers, friends, brothers and sisters in Christ, I tell you, there is no praise that's too great for this lamb. &gt;&gt; Don't be timid about giving him glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] The second verse, I think we ought to sing it again. Brother Rod, my voice is a little down. Will you help me, please? I want everybody to sing the second verse.

Who wouldn't want freedom? &gt;&gt; Prison doors are open. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Prison doors are open. &gt;&gt; Nothing is as strong as the word of God. &gt;&gt; Not in our flesh. &gt;&gt; Not because of what we can do, but because of what he has already done. &gt;&gt; Let the congregation all say together, "It is finished." Can we repeat the words of Jesus once more? The lamb of God. It is finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is no more debt. Satan has no claim on you.

And Father God, we want to say this morning, we're free. &gt;&gt; We're free to worship you and to adore you. We want to lift you up. We want to give you glory, honor, and praise. Lord, we thank you for the word this morning. We thank you for the bleeding, bloody word. We're thankful for the power in it. And we can say, Lord, with the assurance, it's setting us free. This Holy Ghost power is setting us free. So Lord, we ask that you go with your people now and let them go rejoicing. The devil's defeated. Lord, we're free. &gt;&gt; Our chains have been loosed by the word of God. Lord, you're still a bleeding lamb. You're still a lion of the tribe of Judah, and you're still prevailing. So, Father, we're asking you now to go with us as we return tonight rejoicing around the body word of the Son of Man. Strengthen your people. Let them go rejoicing. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] It's all we have just now. Greet one another, you do the rest. Create the atmosphere. Isn't it lovely? God bless you all. Jesus name.
