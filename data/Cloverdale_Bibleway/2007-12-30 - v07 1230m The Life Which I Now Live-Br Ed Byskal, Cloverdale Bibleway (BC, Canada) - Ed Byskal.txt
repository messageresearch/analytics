========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Can we all sing it together this morning? Shall we lift it up to him every morning? [Music] has he changed your life? You prayed on me in your spirit. Oh Lord, you me [Music] forever more. That's one thing that I know for sure. [Music] You made your mercies. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. Truly wonderful to be in the house of the Lord gathered with saints of like precious faith. Look around and see the different ministers that are coming back. Brother Ernie just returning from the Philippines. It's like great eagles soaring back in touchdown just for a few minutes. Brother Tony back saw brother John I believe back from Edmonton. It's coming back to get refreshed. That's why we're here this morning to get refreshed in the presence of the Lord. It's the last Sunday service of the year, 2007. Close out the year. And we just want the Lord to have his way to be pleased to come down and dwell with in the praises of his people this morning. I thought maybe we should start the service off with a song. I pledge allegiance to the lamb. Be a great way to end the year. Great way to begin the new year coming in. So, why don't we sing it together this morning? I have heard how Christians long ago were brought before a tone. They were told that he would spare their lives if they would reounce the name of Christ. But one by one they chose to die. The son of God they would not deny like a brave and quiet. I can almost hear their voice. I pledge alce to the lamb with all my strength. With all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alce to the lamb. Now the years have come and the years have gone but the cause of Jesus it still goes on. Now our time it has come. &gt;&gt; Will you count the cost today? reject this whole world to embrace the cross.

That's our desire this morning, Lord, that your fullness would be found amongst us, oh Father. How worthy are you, Lord, of our worship and our praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

Lord, we want to take time this morning from the abundance of our heart and give you thanks to give you praise, Lord Jesus. To let the formality slip away, to let your presence brood over us, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are welcome in our midst this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you've touched our lives. We're here to give you praise this morning, Lord. It's with thanksgiving in our hearts, Lord, that we approach you, Father. &gt;&gt; Oh, we give you praise, Lord Jesus. There's a great great welling up in our hearts, Lord. Oh, the little river can do nothing more than make a little sound. There's something pushing in behind it. Lord, that's the way we feel this morning. Father, &gt;&gt; oh Jesus, you've done so much for us, Lord. We're such a privileged people to be able to stand this morning in health and body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, to know the revelation of your word for this hour. The great light is shone upon us. &gt;&gt; You've set us free, Lord. from the chains of bondage. Oh, that held us captive. &gt;&gt; We bless your name. &gt;&gt; We bless your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our God is wonderful. Our God is so great. beyond our comprehension. This third dimension would so quickly desire to deceive us and tell us that all we can see is all that really matters. But there's a whole another realm that he would desire the believers to come into this morning where all things are possible to them that believe. We want to be believing for the Smoltz family this morning. There was a prayer request for brother Terry Smoltz's wife, Sister Shannon, spent the night in the ER last night. The doctors couldn't quite track what the virus was that attacked her, quite where it came from. But we have a God who knows exactly how it came in. It knows exactly how it's going to go out. So, we just want to join our hearts together this morning. Brother Lance, would you come down and lead us in prayer this morning? We just want to join our hearts together with them. Ask that the Lord would have his will and way in their life. Many of the congregation may be traveling over the holiday weekend. Does your heart go out for ones who are not among us? Those that have slipped away for whatever reason. They're not here with us. Maybe we can just join our hearts together as a body of believers. would cry out to the Lord. Lord, do something. Send your Holy Spirit by their way this morning. Father, allow grace where we cannot extend grace, but our God is more than able to extend grace this morning. Amen. Let's pray. Our gracious heavenly father, with joy in our hearts, with faith in our hearts, we come to you this morning believing Lord that we are your children. And being children of God, we have a right to come before the throne of grace. And Lord, how thankful we are this morning that we're not approaching a God that one time came down on Mount Si with the law and there was lightnings and thunders so much so that even Moses himself trembled and quake. But Lord, we're coming to Mount Zion. We're coming to a throne of grace. We're coming, God, to lay our petitions before a God that has redeemed us through the blood of Jesus Christ. And Lord, with this we can come with assurance, knowing God that you hear the prayers of your people. Lord, we're not coming to a God that cannot hear, a God that is fabricated in the minds of man, but we're coming to a living savior, one that has touched our hearts, one that has uh changed our lives, one that has wooed us from the pits of sin and debauchery. And we can come clean before you this morning, God, with thanksgiving in our heart and laying our petitions before you, knowing, God, that you not only hear our prayer, but you answer our prayer. And so, Lord, for every burden and every need that is represented here, Lord, we cast our care upon you because you care for us. And we're asking, Lord, that you'll meet every need and answer every prayer and release every burden heart, Lord Jesus. And as we come, Lord, we come not just asking, but Lord, may we leave this great throne of grace with a thanksgiving in our heart. How often have we heard brother Brandham saying, "Now go rejoicing. Whether we feel it, whether we see it, Lord, may the eyes of faith just look beyond that realm of the mortal into the immortal realm and knowing that all things are possible to them that believe. And so God, we commit every need to you, every heart that is represented here, every burden that goes out even to the internet. God, we ask Jesus that we would just be able to touch the hem of your garment and have this faith within our heart. I know a God that answers prayer, Lord. And as we approach the word of God this morning, as your uh servant will stand behind the sacred desk, may father you anoint him. May you anoint every heart. May Jesus, every heart be uh revelated by your spirit. How often have we heard that a man can speak truth, but it takes the spirit of God to reveal the truth? Oh, spirit of God, reveal the truth to our hearts that we might continue to walk in the light as you are in the light as we commit all things to you in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You may have your seats this morning. Sister Melanie Archeletta has a special for us this morning. Right after Sister Melanie, Brother Ryan's going to bless us with a special. So, if they'd come and get ready. We do want to greet each and every one of you this morning. The lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Those on the internet hookup and the invisible audience on the telephone hookup. We want to also greet you. Say, "God bless you." We want to welcome uh we will just have them stand. Sister Linda Moritz's brother Andre Ratif and his wife uh I believe it's pronounced Elsa. If they'd stand and I believe they have three children with them as well. Children. God bless you. Bless you. We want to welcome you into the service of the Lord this morning. We have a couple of announcements we need to make real quickly. Because of the wedding on the weekend of January 11th, the young people's meeting is going to be January 18th and the 25th. So those will be backtoback Fridays. So all the young people be apprised of that. There will be a New Year's Day family skate and all of that information will be on the back bulletin board and that's at Langley Twin Rinks. The senior choir practice has been moved up to 5:00 pm this evening sharp. And be refreshed in the Lord today. This is our only service. So take advantage of every little ounce that you can squeeze out of the minister this morning. He has the whole rest of the day off. So right, Brother Tom, that's right. All that we can get, we want to take from our pastor this morning. whatever the Lord would have laid on his heart. There will be a watch night service tomorrow evening, 900 pm and it says until and then there will be no Wednesday night service either. So we'll be back here regular services starting next Sunday. Bless you. [Music] You're standing in a cold valley. [Music] You dread to face the coming day and all you must go through. The mistakes that you have made of leave you so afraid. But you can rest in knowing I'll be with you all. [Music] I know the place from where you come and the place where you should be. I understand the pain you've held inside and your longing to be free. Your sins have been erased. I can no longer find a trace. My love flows to a hand of grace from a heart of mercy. [Music] I've taken your burdens to myself. I've washed them all away. You have no need to feel discouraged. I'll guide you every day. You're my beloved bride and you are a part of me. Come to me with all your cares. I'll give you sweet release. I know the place from where you've come and the place where you should be. I understand the pain you've held inside and you're longing to be free. Your sins have been erased. You can no longer find a trace. [Music] I know the place from where you come. Found a place where you should be. I understand the pain you held inside and you're longing to be free. Your sins have been erased. I can no longer find a trace. My love flows to a hand of grace. My love flows to a hand of grace. My love flows to a hand of grace from a heart of mercy. [Music] [Applause] [Music] The journey that we travel is a winding narrow road and there are times we stumble a heavy load. Always there's a voice to tell you you'll never make it in. Reminding you of all your failures and long forgotten sin. You know within your heart God's blood has washed you white as snow. Still in your mind, the battle rages and threatens all you know. But even if you're pushed beyond where you feel you can stand, just remember you can put your faith in God's unfailing hand for you. But you won't break. You may stumble and even feel you've lost your way, but you won't fall. God's word remains. You won't be bound by broken chains. You won't be bound by broken chains. [Music] Even though a thousand storms may rage within your life, you will find a resting place within the arms of Christ. We've risen far beyond the realm of lying circumstance. Oh, and nothing formed against this bride will ever stand a chance. Now, you don't have to listen when that voice says you're not free. For God's ordained that you and I should walk in liberty. And freedom's been proclaimed to all the captive and the bound. And in Jesus name, you can hear those chains fall broken to the ground. Fall broken to the ground. You may but you won't pray. You may stumble and even feel you've lost your way, but you won't fall. God's word remains. You won't be found by broken chains. You can't be found. You may be, but you won't break. You may stumble. Oh, and even feel you've lost your way, but you won't fall. God's word remains. You won't be bound by broken chain. You won't be bound by broken chains. You won't be bound. My broken chains you can't be bound. Oh no. A broken chain [Music] by broken chain. Amen. Bless you, brother Ryan, sister, for singing those specials. We appreciate that from their hearts. Amen. As we invite our pastor to come this morning, why don't we just sing together? I bless your name. I bless your name. And prisoners chains with bleeding stripes. Paul and Silas, they reach down inside. They got a hold of something. That's what we've got a hold of this morning. In prisoners chain [Music] with all [Music] began to sing. [Music] I bless your name. I bless your [Music] I [Music] bless your [Music] My destin. [Music] I am [Music] praise God. [Music] reach out and pray [Music] and they will call in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Oh, I bless your name. &gt;&gt; I bless the redeemed of the Lord this morning. I you [Music] praise. You are the [Music] truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. &gt;&gt; As we stand on our feet, we bless your name. your name. &gt;&gt; We bless your name. &gt;&gt; We bless your name. We give you all and you praise. You are the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a lot of different ways to bless his name. We're here not only with our mouth but with our presence. We're here to bless his name. Amen. Are you happy to be alive? &gt;&gt; Are you thankful that you have some another opportunity to say praise God? &gt;&gt; Here we are. thankful to be a brother, a sister in the family of God, that God picked you out of humanity, to be a part of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Ernie. Nice to see you. I'm glad to be alive this morning in the land of the living. David said, "The dead, they praise not the Lord, who are here alive." &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you can never you can never wear out the praises of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we've had prayer this morning, but I just wanted to have the congregation remember uh brother Patrick Aongo. Uh some of you may have heard but our brother Patrick and incidentally I think every time that uh something of this nature is brought before the congregation we should also be mindful that this could be anybody. This could be me. This could be you. You know that uh we we don't have any guarantee that we're going to see the sunrise tomorrow morning. We have no guarantee of that. Uh, brother Patrick had just come back from Congo not very long ago. Sister Rebecca, his wife, is still over there and he wasn't feeling just 100% apparently, but he went into a bank and came out of a bank and then collapsed and and they called an ambulance and just then uh there was an African woman going by. So they said, "Well, do you know this man?" know, she didn't know, but she's uh from Burundi herself and is married to a congalles brother. They were just the you know, married to a congalles brother or a man, I should say. And uh so they had her apparently go in the ambulance uh to the hospital. He went into a coma and they uh thought they determined it was uh malaria and that the malaria had gone to the brain and become cerebral malaria which is actually the last stage of malaria. and they found on his cell phone his wife's number in Congo and called her and told her to hurry back to Canada because they thought that her husband could die at any time. Now, here's a strong man in his 30s and in moments you're in another place. So, uh, Brother Joim, Brother Emmanuel here, uh, got the phone call. Brother Joahim got the phone call from Sister Rebecca and then got our number and called us as well. I didn't get the message till the next morning, but they went to the hospital and and asked the staff to allow them to go in, which they didn't want to permit at first because they do not were not really well acquainted with some of the tropical diseases here and do not have medication for it either. The only medication for the malaria is at Vancouver General and they have some for the entire province, but that's the only place they have it. And uh so brother Joe, brother Emanuel were permitted then to go in and they prayed for him. uh they got the medication to him within 30 minutes from Vancouver General and uh yesterday, this is just day before yesterday and yesterday he did open his eyes and apparently the nurse uh said that he could recognize his own name uh but then began to struggle and so they have him now on an induced coma. He's still in a coma. And so we're praying uh for him now today as a congregation. He's been amongst us and Sister Rebecca is still in the Congo. Uh his his uh situation is grave, but they did they did do a a CAT scan in and of his brain and were able to say last night that the malaria had not reached the brain. And we are indeed thankful for that. And I would say to brother Joim, brother Emmanuel, that I believe their prayer stopped it because there was no other reason for it to stop. And they already thought that he had it and that's why he was in that coma and he's on life support because it's in his chest and uh and so they were pumping the medication into him now. But I believe that prayer reached it before medication did. That's my own firm belief. Our prayer is our most powerful weapon and we must never forget that. So, God bless the brothers. They have not stood behind the pulpit and preached, but as far as I'm concerned, they achieved a great victory for God. &gt;&gt; And so, we can pray for our brother and pray for sister Rebecca. And naturally, you can imagine what a young wife and a young mother her feeling this morning. uh or even now knowing that her husband is laying in a in this condition, but I believe that God will hear us as we pray. So, we're going to pray together and and we'll pray also for the service and the word that the Lord wants us to hear. Father, we will we will soon be opening the scriptures and soon be reading words that you have inspired for all scriptures given by inspiration. We believe that you have breathed upon and through your prophets and your holy men and the holy apostles. You have caused, oh God, uh a word in season. You have caused the word to be spoken and scribed down so that it could be read and known, oh God, that the Holy Spirit then would take that word which is Christ. A word which was time locked for a certain season. And now we've come to a season, oh God, coming now to a turn of another year on our calendar. But you are timeless. You are eternal. And we are eternal in you, Lord. We were in your thoughts before the world ever came into existence. Before the universe was made, oh God, we cannot grasp your greatness and how marvelous you are. But we are here believing that you have put breath into these bodies. We believe that you have brought us and have seen us all down through the lineage that we have come down through, Lord, to this moment. We believe that you've had a hand in bringing us from nations, uh, many nations and different countries and different cities and places. And you've brought us into this sanctuary today. And you've allowed, oh God, that the voice and the atmosphere, the service would reach into homes around the world, Lord, in many different lands. And they are our brothers and sisters, part of the bride body of Jesus Christ. And so today, Lord, we unite our hearts together. And we're here asking you, oh God, to hear our words and to see our hearts as we pray for Brother Patrick. Lord, I thank you that we've had men of faith that have gone and stood at the bedside and brought a halt to the enemy who's tried to take his life prematurely. Oh God, you're a God of the supernatural. You are supernatural, Lord. You're far beyond this realm that we're in and our faith, Lord, the sixth sense. We reach out there, Lord, knowing and giving you glory for a work already done. And we pray, Lord, you will raise him up and give him a testimony in his mouth, Lord, and do a work in his heart. I pray be with his precious wife, our sister Rebecca, Lord, and her mother and the family, oh God. I pray, Father, you'll just give her a comfort. Give her that peace that passes all understanding. And be with us now this morning, Lord, as we give you thanks for hearing our prayers and seeing our desires, Lord. And we know that it shall be done. You said that if we believe, if we ask and agree together and we agree today, Lord, that it shall be done that the desires of our heart will be met. This is your promise. Give us, I pray, Lord, the direction of the Holy Spirit. Now we give you all the praise and the glory in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the people said agreement. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I'll ask you to take your Bibles and uh as you've heard the announcement, no service this evening, service tomorrow night. We're going to have a wonderful time and no service on Wednesday. I'd like you to turn to First Corinthians the 14th chapter. We're going to begin reading at the sixth verse. This is uh we're going to be not only turning a page in the calendar, but we're going to be getting another calendar. I suppose you'll be starting with 208 pretty soon. And who knows what that holds. Maybe 208 is rapture. &gt;&gt; I know we get an amen on that one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're just happy to have you all here and participating in the meeting. Brother Andre and his wife and family. God bless you. So nice to have you. Last time I was with brother Andre, I think was out in the jungle of Africa and they were hunting for meat and I was there enjoying myself and I appreciated that. God bless. Give you a good time here. All right, we're going to read 1 Corinthians 14 and6. Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine? And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? For you shall speak into the air. There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification. I'd like you also to turn, if you would, to Galatians the 2 chapter. going to read just verse 20. Galatians 2 and 20. I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. That scripture is very personal and I would invite you to read it together with me. Let's read it together. I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life of to now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. God bless his word to us. You're be seated. I'll just need your full attention now and I'll appreciate that. God will appreciate it. I want to uh take a text and a title for the message out of the scripture we just read in Galatians, the life which I now live. I thought of that in reference to we're closing out a year. The life that I now live, the life I now live in the flesh, in fact, but the life I now live, I live by the faith of the son of God. And faith cometh by hearing, by hearing the word of God. And that's the faith we live by. I want to take also from the first scripture reading in Corinthians that the the the sound there is there are so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification. And when we think of voice we think of perhaps the voice that you speak with. But I want to suggest to you today that our life, just our life, the kind of people we are is actually a sound. And I will prove that through the scripture and through the message. Um, we come from many many different nations. We that are seated here today. And if you've traveled and become acquainted with other countries, other peoples, you can observe people. And I'm one that I'm a great I really love to observe people. I can sit on the side of the street or sit in an airport. I don't get bored because I really like to study people and uh study their features and study just the way their manner is. And quite often you can tell not only that this person is from Europe but uh maybe a certain part of Europe or this person is from Switzerland or Germany or this person's from Russia because there are just certain features and certain mannerisms and and you can kind of tell where a person perhaps came from and uh and so it is actually saying something to you this person is from this part of the world or and and even without them saying any words you can detect something and uh I I'm sure you're acquainted with that. I've talked to uh I talked to brother Dier about about Africa and the and the wars and everything in Africa and uh you know Congo had a lot of years of war and then there was uh uh uh Rwanda and Bundi and they were fighting and the different tribes were fighting and I just asked I was just curious how do they know you know how do they know who is of what tribe and uh oh he said they can because they the features are a little different. They can identify it right away and you know it's just amazing. So the even the features of a person or uh and how they are if you know what to look for you can see so it starts to register to you and you get a message well this person is from that part of the world. the Peter when he was trying to uh you know conceal himself in Pilate's judgment hall and they they said well you were also with him so maybe that person saw him but then the little maid came says but your speech betrays you now she didn't say your words betray you but she just could tell from the manner of his speech and how he spoke you're Galilean there were many Galileans there but she identified him. You're a Galilean from the manner of the speech. This is the way you say things. And perhaps the way you conduct yourself. And it it starts giving a sound. It begins to reverberate. What kind of an individual, what kind of a person? The Bible says that there is no sound without signific signification. And uh God when he was speaking to Job, he asked Job, "Do you hear the lion's welp? Do you hear the you know, do you hear the even the birds that cry uh for their food and so on? Do you hear that?" Well, what kind of sound is that? That and yet it had it had a signification. But God who created the creature understands understands it's crying for food understands. Do do you hear the groaning when they're bowing themselves down in birth? Do you hear that? God could hear that. It It's a sound. It meant something to God. God looked on his creation and he has pleasure in his creation. And as he was asking Job all these questions, as for Job finally says, "I'll put my hand over my mouth. I won't even try to answer this." Right? &gt;&gt; So things without sound except they give a distinction of sound. How shall we know what is piped or harped? Brother Brandham uh standing before the people and very often when there the revealing of the son of man and the revelation of the secrets of the hearts of the people and he would remind them this microphone this microphone here I have one here closer you maybe can't see but this microphone he said this is mute this is just mute This has no life within itself. But but a a a sound if a sound is made through it then it is activated &gt;&gt; and and then you you hear something. Perhaps if you were if there was no electronics here, perhaps people up in the balcony or certainly people in the fellowship room, they wouldn't be able to hear what's going on. They might see the screen and see words and see my mouth moving say well I know he's saying something but my mind is not illuminated because I can't hear what is being said but the thing is the microphone might be there but if there was no uh no electricity or it would be mute within itself and then brother Brandham is saying now not just a microphone but he's referring to himself &gt;&gt; that he is mute mute. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's mute except there be one with the knowledge uh that knows the secret of the heart of the individual. &gt;&gt; And that's the only one that can give the sound. &gt;&gt; And so the individual, we as individuals, as members of the bride body of Jesus Christ, we're mute. We don't really have a sound that's worth hearing &gt;&gt; except that God by his spirit will somehow speak through this mute instrument. And it's important that we are mute. It's important that we are not here to uh express ourselves or to make known, you know, who we are. That's just that's just human ego, human pride, and it doesn't mean anything to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're here for a purpose &gt;&gt; and outside of that purpose, we haven't really got uh a great deal of of purpose in the world. When God spoke to Job, you might be interested in this scripture. He said, "Who provideth for the raven his food?" uh when his young uh cry out unto God, when his young when the raven, the young raven cries out unto God, you think the raven knows he's crying out to God, but God's telling Job, he's crying to me, &gt;&gt; crying out for his food. He said, and he was asking him, who provideth this? And he says, they wonder for lack of meat. And so there are there are times when a person uh there's a specific moment they're crying out for food, but there's times for us and I'm laying quite a foundation here today and I need I need to take this time. There's times in our lives when a moment arrives when you need to speak and say something because that precise moment, it's a critical moment and you need to say something. Sometime a person needs to say, "Forgive me. I'm sorry. I did wrong." And it's amazing what those words will do. &gt;&gt; They fix things. Amen. There's times to say, and we have arrived, I'm sure everyone here, I trust everyone has arrived at a moment of realization. Says, Lord, I am a sinner. &gt;&gt; That moment had to arrive to the thief on the cross. &gt;&gt; Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom. And so, I want to give you another phrase today. Speak now or forever hold your peace because this is our opportunity. You're not going to arrive to this day or this year. 207 is gone &gt;&gt; and you're moving on into another year of of our understanding and we do not know what the days ahead of us uh will hold. But I say that the very fact that God has you here, the very fact that he even drew you, made himself known to you, revealed this word to you, brought the message to you, that in itself has already told you God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; God's thoughts is I've laid my hand on you. I've pulled you. I've drawn you. I've opened your eyes. I've opened your understanding. I've touched your heart. I've touched your spirit. And so this is the time that we must now speak with the sound of our life. &gt;&gt; And our life speaks louder &gt;&gt; than even words. &gt;&gt; Speak now or forever hold your peace. There's a critical moment. When you draw your last breath, your life will be done sounding. But while you're here, you're still sounding. There's a sound from your life. &gt;&gt; And the sound you make is not the sound I make. We all make our own individual you unique sound in the earth and in our unique place wherever that may be. It's a sound that only you can make. So I want to say to this congregation today and all who are hearing the service, it's time for us. speak now &gt;&gt; or forever hold our peace &gt;&gt; because you'll not have this opportunity to to live the life that we're living today. You can't live it tomorrow and you can't live yesterday's life today. This is the only day we can live it. So by our very life speak now &gt;&gt; the life which I now live &gt;&gt; and I think that's marvelous that Apostle Paul said the life that I now live I don't live because I ate a breakfast this morning or that I had certain you know vitamins in my body the life I now live I live by the faith of the son of God &gt;&gt; hallelujah that's what gives us energy that's what gives us animation and motivation &gt;&gt; amen Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a different sort of a life than we lived a few years ago. &gt;&gt; I thought that some of the young people might might have liked and perhaps some of the older ones as well would have enjoyed. I started thinking about my own life. I got to say something in 207. I got to say something if the Lord grants me time in 208. The life has to speak. Right. &gt;&gt; So, I got thinking, well, got thinking about the first car I ever owned. And I thought, I just wonder what what the young people would say if I put it up on the screen. I actually did find I scanned a whole bunch of pictures and found a 1947 a Plymouth Coupe and you'd enlight a whole bunch of people today said, "Oh, that's cute." Well, I thought it was a lot of work when I had it. And then I got a 47 student baker. And then I got thinking about where I went to school. I thought, "Oh, the kids would like to see this. A one room log school." And there's probably a few others here that have been in similar places. So, I found a picture of a log school. I was looking for the very one I went to. I thought there might even be a picture through the marbles of Google, you know. And uh I thought that was the funniest word when I first heard it, but I use it almost every day now. It's not so strange. But I I found people that were in the same community and there's writeups about them. I thought, "Isn't that amazing? I know him and I know this one and I know that one." I lived at the one one family's place and there's their name showing up on Google. I thought, "This is incredible. This is incredible." So I thought you might like to see but I I I I'm just not going to take the time to the the log school but it's it's very different today. So 207 isn't you know 1943 and 1944 to but I could have said back then the life I now live. I ride a horse to school and if I haven't got a horse and they're using it, I got to walk. And the life I now live and mostly walked. But the life I now live is quite different. But still the same life, &gt;&gt; still the same life that's surging through the same body. But what is it that motivates it? What is it that moves it? What is it that drives it forward? And that's the key. That's the thing that we want to talk about. the life we now live. The Bible speaks through Daniel, God speaking through Daniel. And he said, "But thou, oh Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased." And it didn't it wasn't hard for me looking at my computer and and uh just a thought come into your mind and I thought how did how's all the young people how's the folks going to go to church? How am I going to go to church tomorrow morning? Well, I'm going to get in my car inside this garage and push the button and the door's going to go up and I'm going to back out and drive on my way to church. But then I thought, you know, I'm the same person. said, "What did you do when you were young and boarded out here on this farm?" Thought, "Well, I went to church in a lumber wagon." You don't know what a lumber wagon is, but it is what it says. You know, it they hold lumber in it or coal in it. So, I pulled a picture up of that, too, for you. But I just tell you, it is so rough. That lumber wagon on a dirt road, it just jarred my inside. So, I got pains in my side, bad pains. I thought this is more torture than walking. I'm going to walk. So, that's some and then go go go three miles to church, you know, at about four miles an hour. That's a pretty good pace. And here they don't think anything. Oh, I'm just going to go to Lynon. No, I think I'll go down to Bellingham. Oh, oh, let's go to Seattle or let's get on a plane and go and see my girlfriend or my boyfriend. We're all going to be going down to a wedding down in Idaho, so we can't have the young people's service because we're all going down. That was that was a nightmare. Now, that would have been a wild dream. And I thought, going to get on a plane and air's going to go out of the tail and it's going to fly across the ocean. Those things, you know, that was uh uh that was Flash Gordon or as we say, Flash Gordon. Hey. And I'd look at all those things, you know, and people with masks on and and big uh circular uh freeways and people driving in these kind of vehicles. But the life that I now live, I understand that &gt;&gt; back then it was mysterious. Back then it was comic strip stuff. But today happens to be a reality. And some of it that was in comic strips then is old stuff now. The life that we now live spiritually speaking, we are not back in the horse and buggy days spiritually. &gt;&gt; And neither are we just in a airplane day according to the countdown. We happen to be in an astronaut age. &gt;&gt; And a prophet identified that we're we're in an astronaut age. And then he he he didn't say, "Oh, the horse and buggy is nothing new to the scripture." But he said, "Uh, astronauts is not new to us. We have our astronauts. Enoch was one of our astronauts. Elijah was one of our astronauts. And Jesus was one." Hey, they they just they left. They actually left this earth. &gt;&gt; Enoch walked with God. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that he pleased God? Do &gt;&gt; you believe he had this testimony that he pleased God? &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that God took him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God took him. It actually something physically happened and he passed into some other dimension. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible tells us in the book of Acts, the disciples, they begin to live out a different kind of a life. And it says this, "And it shall come to pass," Peter speaking, "and it shall come to pass afterward, I'm sorry, this is Joel now, and then I'm going to go to Acts. Joel speaking the prophet. And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. Many, many years later, here comes uh Peter on the on in Acts two. He says, "But this is that here's the people now filled with the Holy Spirit and they're speaking in tongues and they're staggering like drunk people and they're out on the streets." And incidentally, it happens to be at a time too. I thought of this God choosing a particular time when all people from many many nations were gathered into Jerusalem. And God chose that moment to bring these people out from the upper room full of the Holy Spirit. And it says, "But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel." Now they heard them speaking and glorifying God, but the whole thing was a mystery to them. They didn't understand that these were the words of Joel now being manifested in their life. Now, isn't it amazing that when the Holy Spirit took charge of these people and took absolute control of them that they begin to act out something that had been written hundreds of years before &gt;&gt; so that one could stand amongst them and say, "This is that word." &gt;&gt; What you're seeing, &gt;&gt; not only what you're hearing, but what you're seeing is Joel 2. This is that which was spoken by Joel the prophet. And he says and in the 33rd verse of the same chapter, Acts two, therefore being at the right hand of God exalted and having received of the father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath sent forth this which you now see and hear. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just what you hear, but what you see and hear. What you're seeing, Peter is saying, what you're seeing is Acts Joel 2. &gt;&gt; That's what you're seeing and you're also hearing it. We don't want to come to a place in the message where we just hear, hear, here, here, and here. We must realize what we're hearing. It's not what the world only the world doesn't only want to hear what we're saying. They want to see it. &gt;&gt; They want to be able to say, "This is that which has been spoken by Malachi. &gt;&gt; Malachi prophesied and I'm living it." &gt;&gt; Malachi said, "The hearts of the children would be turned to the fathers and you are seeing it. You are viewing it." That's what's happened. &gt;&gt; You see where I'm going? &gt;&gt; You are now seeing the word of God promised. That's what Peter is saying. You're now seeing what God promised through the prophet Joel. You are seeing it. This is that the life that I now live in the flesh. I'll suggest to you and you could you should put this down. The life that I now live in the flesh is the word promised for this day. We don't want to live history. &gt;&gt; We want to live the word that is promised for this day. And the Bible says their sound went into all the earth. Romans 10 and 18. But I say, have they not heard? Yes, verily their sound went into all the earth. Not merely their words, not merely their voice, but their sound, their very life. Most of you here have never stood behind a pulpit to preach. You might think, "Oh, I had a wonderful opportunity to give a witness. I had a chance and I spoke. I was able to witness." Ah, but I want to say to you, you're speaking every day. &gt;&gt; You are speaking every day. And the prophet has said that our thoughts and our actions, our thoughts actually speak louder in heaven than our words do on earth. The sound, it says, "But their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world." Their sound I found it very very interesting. I don't know if I can convey it to you because I don't know if you could re remember from last Sunday but I spoke on light that you you are light and that the manifested word is light. Now if you can just hold that he said that when God said let there be light said if light didn't come then it wasn't God's word. If a fog came then it wasn't God's word. When God said, "Let there be light," might have been millions of years. I don't know. But if God said it, then it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; It's going to happen exactly like that. And when light came, that light was the word of God made manifest. So God said, "I'll send Elijah the prophet, and he'll turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers." Now, that was time locked. That was that's all done. That's finished. That's concluded. Why? Because God said it. Now, if it never happened, then God didn't say it. But if God said it, has to happen exactly like that. And so I'd like to just tie that back to the prophet standing here saying now he's showing even the sign. What what was the sign for? The sign was to catch the attention of the people. &gt;&gt; And some of them their hearts got turned back to the faith of the fathers. Some did not. Most did not. But some did &gt;&gt; and some never saw it, but they heard about it. Some heard it perhaps on a tape or they read about it or they had a witness about it and it spoke to something in their heart. &gt;&gt; They didn't even know the scripture, but right away a change, a transformation began to take place. What is it? It was the power of that word now anchoring in their own heart and changing them, transforming them. It is that scripture that's happening. It's Malachi that's happening. That's just one scripture. I want to come to some more after a little bit. And and if you went into the even this phrase and their sound, their sound comes the word sound comes from uh a first root word which is to speak and that word comes from another root word which is the same as light and eventually ends up at foss which is light. Arise and shine for your light has come. The light, the word light and the word sound all have come down down to the same root words. Exactly. Why? Because God in God's understanding and in the Bible's understanding to speak brings light. To speak brings knowledge. &gt;&gt; To speak brings understanding. and understanding and knowledge of the truth is light. So it's the same thing exactly whether it's light or whether it's voice, God has the same intention. It's to bring light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now not only geographically to the ends of the world, it says the Bible says, "But have they not heard?" Yes, verily their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world, and the end of the world is not just geographically extending through time, not just geographically, but it is also extending through time. Their sound went to the ends of the earth. They're sound. I don't know what how God or what God will uh determine will be the terminating point in time. I don't think that God is locked into the Roman calendar. It's a Roman calendar that you have. And brother Brandham talks about a number of different calendars. He there's an astronomical, you know, uh a calendar. There's a old uh there's scientific calendar. He said that Israel is God's time piece. And I maybe we'll touch on it a wee bit tomorrow night. We're not going to preach tomorrow night, but just I would like to throw a couple of things in. I think I found it really quite significant that just in the last few days, Russia released an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now, this was a nation that just a few years ago didn't have enough fuel to put in an airplane. They were so bankrupt they didn't have a fuel to put in an airplane to fly their men who work in the oil fields up to the oil fields. I mean, they were brought to nothing. But during that time, out came the Jews. So that an accident and almost a million Jews left the Soviet Union and arrived back in Israel and a prophet's words which is God's word saying they have the elect have to be back there. &gt;&gt; That's God's word. &gt;&gt; And once it once it's spoken nations there's no such a thing as a superpower with God. God's the superpower &gt;&gt; and he can take a superpower and cause it to collapse within itself. &gt;&gt; And the Soviet Union imploded upon itself till the whole world was shot. And how did it happen? Well, it happened because God said that these people have to come out and they were refusing them to have exit permits to to leave the country and bleeding them of all of their money as well and having to pay to leave the country. That's God's word. You understand what I'm saying? We see things happening, but God is behind the scenes directing things. He lets nations rise and he lets them collapse. He let kingdoms rise. He lets them collapse. God's in control. &gt;&gt; You believe that? But now and I find it very amazing and I want to say to you in all sincerity and you want to think about this very very deeply. How does a man that was so in tune with the events and could preach the 1100 and some messages that brother Brandon preached. How does a man live the most of his life when the superpowers between America and the Soviet Union, which was the USSR, it was known as the Soviet Union. It was called the Soviet Union. The map said USSR, the Soviet Union. Brother Brandham, to my knowledge, never used the words Soviet Union once. said Russia. Said Russia. Listen folks, why was that? Because in the mind of God, it was Russia. And now the Soviet Union collapsed. But what's rising out of the ruins, the phoenix, is Russia. God knew that oil, which was $15 a barrel, would almost be a hundred. And God knew that once the Soviet Union had collapsed, I'm not speaking politics, but you understand these things are involved in what we know and what our messenger spoke of. Are you following me? And now from their vast oil revenues, they're able and they they have a a very very cunning leader in Mr. Putin. I don't say that negative way. He's a very intelligent man, man trained up under their security system, the KBG. And and now they're pouring these revenues into new weapons. And this missile they just released the other day, just a few days ago, had multiple warheads. And they sent it 4,300 and some miles and release those warheads to different locations. And the news report is that everyone hit their site. Multiple warheads, which we say that's other cities. That's what the multiple warheads is all about. other cities may be hundreds of miles apart, but every one of those words, what is he saying? He's saying to the world and that nation is saying to the world, they didn't have to broadcast it. But when you see that the time has arrived, the life that we now live, we're living in a time when nations are are on the edge. are walking on eggshells &gt;&gt; and are trying to manipulate and their friendship and their their ties and their military strengths and test the strengths of others and so on. And now the day that we live in now, we're living in a time that that not very many years ago in our lifetime, perhaps in my lifetime, lifetime of others here, we never had that kind of a threat. &gt;&gt; But today we have a global threat. Brother Brandham talks about a fanatic rising. Says all it takes is one fanatic to pull the trigger. He's talking about a consolidation of power and and destruction to be in the hands of a fanatic. Says only take one fanatic to pull the trigger. I thought also you've no doubt heard the news and been staying ab breast with a lot of these things but the assassination of Miss Bhau in Pakistan uh in last week this last week and we have a letter from brother Anoir in Pakistan man and he said that what you're hearing in the news isn't even near what is taking place. Said we they're having riots in every city the major cities and the country is very very unsettled but but beyond that I hope you can follow me and I hope you have a little time. Pakistan is the only Muslim nation on earth that has a nuclear stockpile. 165 million people, the only Muslim country. And I just thought that I would just seek and see what Pakistan's real belief concerning Israel was. and Pakistan back as far as uh uh way back when they when Britain through the Belfar Belffor declaration was controlling P Palestine and they resisted from the very beginning a Jewish state and their belief is that and they've declared it their belief is from way back there. belief is that Palestine to be not to be under if it's not under Muslim control, it's like it's a absolute unbelievable thing. It must be under Muslim control because those are the holy sites of the Muslim nation. And now, isn't this unusual? Now, we have America and the Western world and the European. And I never intended to get into this this as much as I was saving some for tomorrow night, but I'll just unload it now. And now we have uh we have America, which is the forerunner, the vanguard for freedom in the world, putting forward that democracy is the way. And Miss BH was in the elections in a few days on the 8th looked like she would be the winner in the election. and be the prime minister of the president of the nation. And America in the western world was very very happy because she stood for democracy. Democracy is almost like a god. &gt;&gt; The the freedom of the people. Well, you know, America put a tremendous amount of pressure on Israel and upon the Palestinian people to have which are Islamic to have a freedom of vote. If you just have a vote, then be free. You'll be like us and you'll vote in who you want as a leader. And they had a vote. They had a democratic process and they voted in the terrorists. Are you getting the picture? &gt;&gt; And now we've got a a Muslim nation with nuclear weapons, with fanatics that care nothing about destroying themselves. If they care nothing about destroying themselves, I guarantee you they care nothing about destroying you. &gt;&gt; Or they care nothing about destroying Christians. or they care nothing about destroying America or they'd be delighted &gt;&gt; if they had that power. &gt;&gt; They've demonstrated that and they've killed tens of thousands of Jewish people and of others. And they may say, well, it's not a violent people. Well, it is strange that most of the violence that has been taking place has come from those quarters. Did brother Brandham see this? I believe that he did. And he says, uh, it only takes one fanatic. And one of the concerns right now as you and I are seated here is will there be will extremists actually win in the democratic process? Will they actually win? And then with and you could find out friends before the next 30 days is over you could find that there's a nuclear power in the world in the hands of the very terrorists they're trying to control at the border the life that I now live. We wouldn't say this maybe five years ago or 10 years ago when you young people were children. Maybe this wasn't a concern. Perhaps brother Biscll may be over the edge. I don't think so. I think probably we don't even see everything that's going on. We live in a serious time now. That's on the world scene. Now, if that's happening on the world scene and such dramatic things are happening on the world scene, what do you think God is doing on the spiritual scene? You think he's just raising up the believers of this message to be a church here and a church over there and another church there? That's not what he's raising up. He's not raising up just a people that's got another doctrine. The world's full of doctrines. He's raising up a people to fulfill the written word of God. &gt;&gt; And there is a scripture written concerning this hour, &gt;&gt; concerning this time, 207. If it wasn't a scripture here, we're here in vain. We're here wasting our lives. I say go out and eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die. But that's not the case. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's a word for this season. And the prophet of God said he he gave out a word for every season, for every time. He allotted so much for that time, for that day, and for this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God has a word for 207. God has a word for 208. And God has a people that's living it out. You may never preach a message, but your very life will give a sound. There's a sound emanating out from you. &gt;&gt; I've I have quite a few quotes I'm coming too. Now I've come to the nub of my message. You know, God uses strange things to anchor something. And I thought, how will I get to the people that even though they be silent, yet there is a sound that emanates out from them? &gt;&gt; God uses strange things I had to have. I didn't have to have but I the doctor suggested that I have a certain medical procedure says you'll have to go to the hospital okay fine so I go to the hospital and it's nuclear medicine and uh have sister Sheila she works in that department I was the sorry hospital so I'm sitting there there's a sign on the wall that says uh if you intend to cross the border, you get a letter from the hospital. So, uh when I went in the other day, because it was a two two-stage process, and uh I I don't know I've never had this kind of thing before. So, I go up to the desk and I said, "Oh, by the way, before you start this, I've got to go across the border and be with brother Chris in uh uh in just a little while." So, as soon as I'm out of here, I'm going across the border. Oh, they said, "Okay." They opened a file and pulled out a letter and stamped it and wrote my name on it and and signed it and all the rest says, "You'll need this." They put an envelope here. Just carry this with you. Fine. So, I'm laying there. I take you in for the procedure. Brother Chris told me, he says, he says, "You're going to light up like a light bulb." I said, "I am?" Yeah. He says, "You have guards running all around your car at the border." What? Oh, yeah. guy says they picked that up because they're going to put they're going to put you know radiation in you. You're it's going to you know they're they'll be around. Well, how will they even know? So, I'm thinking about this and I'm laying there and the nurse comes over and sticks that IV says is just going to prick your hand here and put an IV. Sure, fine. Go ahead. So, she picks it in and this IV and it's dripping and I'm just watching this drip drip drip drip. thought, "Isn't this incredible?" It's just silent. I can't even hear it. Just dripping coming right down that tube into my bloodstream going right into my heart. And this is going to make a sound. This is actually going to make a sound. A total silent thing. This whole process totally silent. And I just laid there and I thought, "That's the promises of God. God dropped those promises into my bloodstream a long time ago. And I just watched and I started getting blessed. Those drips going on. Promise after promise. I started thinking about the promises going right into my bloodstream. Yep. Went right to my heart. Glory to God. Changed my heart. I could hardly keep that IV in. I was getting so blessed. Thought, "Yes." And I get up out of here after the promises of God come in, strike my heart, and my life just starts sounding out. &gt;&gt; They And they don't know what it is. They don't know where it came from, but it sure making a definite sound. And I was getting blessed laying there. Sure enough, I went to the border, drove my car up, and I saw him take a special pad, and he starts writing on this pad. I said, "Oh, just excuse me." I said, "I have a letter from the hospital, and uh I just had a nuclear medicine test this morning." Yeah. Yeah. He said, "It's beeping here." Said, "It is?" "Yeah, you have to go in." So I was in there for an hour. Then they put you to a put a little machine out. He said, "You go and stand over there. Just stand there and I'm going to put this machine right here." They put that machine. He went and got his little clicker, clicked it. Yeah. He says, "There it is." And uh I said, "So that and it's beeping. Beep beep beep." He said, "Now come out to the counter." and he brings that machine out and points it at me and I'm standing right there. I'm not saying a word. That machine is telling him, he says, "I can even tell you what type of radiation this is." Says, "There's two kinds. You have two kinds." And and he he's writing down, he's entering it all in. And I I'm probably logged in that computer that Edward Biscoll passport number, license number, this that. No. They got everything on you. There's no secrets anymore. Came across the border and who knows what on the date and this kind of radiation and this kind of radiation and and we're marked. &gt;&gt; I thought I tell you I was marked long before they got me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Something got pumped into my veins, pumped down into my heart and the promises of God silently, silently coming in. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, if science can do that, I tell you, God has gone way beyond science. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've been infected &gt;&gt; by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I thought of you, Brother Chris. I'm going to come up there and just let you put the IV in me. Well, that took on a whole new meaning to me. I hope you're still hooked up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that all right? &gt;&gt; So, something silent actually gave a sound. I couldn't believe it. The thing's actually screaming in there and the stuff that's inside of me just came in silently in my whole body. I thought, "Oh my, God's dropped the promises." The people of God, that's what we're doing here tonight, this morning rather. We're just hearing the word of God coming into your heart. Perhaps just a silent movement of God by the Holy Spirit, but it's reaching the heart. It's reaching the part it's intended to reach and it gives a beep. I believe the devil hears it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan hears it. &gt;&gt; And and and and demons of hell are trembling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If a prophet of God could come from the back room, and he told me this with his own lips, and while the angel of the Lord is speaking to him back there is telling him, "When you come to the pulpit, there'll be a woman up on the right hand balcony in a yellow coat." Hope there's no one there with the yellow coats. I'm not even looking. And he says, "And the demon that's in her is going to tie together. It's going to call out to a man sitting down in the middle section. And those two are going to come against you. You're going to war against you. Have no fear. I'll be there." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My friends, the spiritual realm, we know so little. Let's not get bogged down with this little life that we're in and the little details of this life. There's another whole world just a breath away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the word that you have received is screaming out. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this. When he gets on the other side, he wants to hear his voice. &gt;&gt; And when I get on the other side, when you get on the other side, you want to hear your voice calling out. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to say a lot of things. Say, "Yay, Lord. I believe that. &gt;&gt; I believe what I'm hearing. I believe this testimony. &gt;&gt; Our life is the word of God for this day being fulfilled. And now here's some quotes. Please listen closely in a message. Why little bethlehem? He says, "Oh God, anoint us," this is in prayer, "with thy word and bring thy word promised of this day to pass. bring thy word promised for this day to pass. And may we leave this building this morning as shining instruments of God. May we go to the go with the sword it glittering in the air to cut away every weight and everything else till we can get back to the people of Christ and bring a cool fresh drink to our Lord. In the third seal, he said they miss him. The living word manifested in the flesh by the word that is promised. The word promised to do these things and they miss it. They don't know what it is. Even like the guards, they didn't know what it was. They only knew that they only knew that it was something they needed to check out. &gt;&gt; The world doesn't know. They hear the sound of your life. If you just took the believers around the world of this message, it's a different sound. It's not a denominational sound. &gt;&gt; It's not a Pentecostal sound. It's not a Baptist sound. And even when they just see and view the believers, you haven't said a word yet, but they know it's a different sound. &gt;&gt; Hasn't that been your experience? &gt;&gt; You want to thank God for that. &gt;&gt; It isn't just your appearance, but it's your manner. It's your department. It's how you handle yourself and how perhaps just just your conduct they say this is different. &gt;&gt; This is different. I think of a little testimony during the witness 2000 conference and they found a man over here. Many of you people saw those huge sandwiches that they made and they handed out to all the ministers so they'd have something to eat at night because we were out too let out the service too late for them to get something in a restaurant. So they handed out these sandwiches and there's a person up here uh brother Tom knows all about it. And uh who who went with you, brother Tom? &gt;&gt; Brother John Andy's. Okay. And uh so he heard all about it. He made marvelous marvelous sandwiches. turned out the man is a foul-mouthed man and loud and and forward and he just doesn't care for anything or anybody and Sister Karen Ashdown went down and he walked in. She walked in. He's got people in there and he prides himself in being crude and just cra, you know, a very ungodly man. And Sister Karen Ashdon walks in. He says, "Ho ho. Here's a lady. This is different." And sometime later, here come brother John Andes and Brother Tom in because they had to make some arrangements for it. And when they walk in, now he's had all kinds of people. He goes on with his cursing and whatever more. And here comes in two other brothers from the same from the same origin. He says, "You must be connected with that lady that was here." &gt;&gt; That was the first time in his life. &gt;&gt; I've been to a restaurant just down over the hill here and had a waitress say to me, "Are you connected to those young ladies that come in here with the real long hair?" I said, "I sure am." She said, "I thought so." I said, "You want to just come up and see where we're at? You want to come up and see where we worship? Where is it at? Maybe she's come here already. I don't know. There's a sound." &gt;&gt; Hear the joyful sound. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word has been fulfilled and is being fulfilled. That's my announcement to you. That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; You're not here to be a carpenter or a plumber or something else. You're here because the word of God is being fulfilled in you. might say, "Well, I never do anything. I never say anything. I never sing." That has nothing to do with it. Your life is sounding it out. &gt;&gt; You've got it in your veins. &gt;&gt; Royal seed. &gt;&gt; And the seed is not air. He said, "How that this great mystery of God being made known understand how that God was in Christ reconciling the world uh reconciling the world. How that he and the father are one. How that the great mysteries of the fulfilling the mysteries the way perhaps the reason you don't understand everything because he's he referred to it as the mysteries of God. The mysteries of the fulfilling of God taking and bringing himself manifested in the age of human beings and in the strain of human beings and in the company of human beings. Hallelujah. In the strain of human beings. In the company of human beings. The great mystery of God unfolding making himself known and revealing himself and manifesting himself. &gt;&gt; Now friends, I'm away from being done. So you just hang on, will you? &gt;&gt; Manifesting himself. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "What if it wasn't manifested?" &gt;&gt; What if it wasn't manifested? You know, God can say it, but if it's not manifested, what use is it? &gt;&gt; So God's concern, God's interest is is unbelievably important and it's the importance is placed upon it being manifested. What good would it be if a man came out on the platform before tens of thousands of people said the time for Malachi 4 to be fulfilled has come out and the time of the revealing of the son of man Luke 17:30 the hour has come and it all fell right there it was announced it was verbal words the the hour has come the time has come. But nothing happened. What good would it be? Where where's that going to go? But then you have that word begin to be manifested. And once it's manifested, once it's displayed, the people can look at it. They may not change, but they can look at it. And then they're faced with believe it or disbelieve it. become a believer or remain an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Once it's manifested, so the manifestation, and I have the quotes here now, I'm just saying this ahead of time so you'll catch it while we read it. You are, it's not me making you feel good. You are the manifestation of the word for this hour. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go, you don't have to go out and say, "I believe Malachi 4. I believe a manifestation of the promise of this hour. You don't even have to say that. I'm telling you your life like the isotopes in my veins. You've got more than isotopes in your veins. You've got a faith &gt;&gt; in your heart that has made a word become active in your life. &gt;&gt; And it lives it out. &gt;&gt; It's a life that's lived. &gt;&gt; It's not just a life that's confessed. Your confession is is is good and your confession but your confession in the life must match. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'll say amen to my own message. So the the mystery of the fulfilling in the strain of human beings and in the company of human beings. And this is why he said, "Bringing himself manifested in the age of human beings, in the company of human beings, and in the strain of human beings to make his word manifested in this day, in the eastern rising of the sun, and to do the same thing as the sun sets in the west, to make himself manifested said, "In a bride church, the word made manifested." And it shall come to pass, said Zachchariah, probably not knowing what he was speaking. It shall come to pass. It shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord. Not day, not night, but it shall come to pass that in the evening time, &gt;&gt; it shall be light. And I was saying to you that a word spoken if you take it root word. A spoken word in God's vocabulary means light comes. God doesn't speak and darkness comes. &gt;&gt; God speaks and light comes. &gt;&gt; And what did the prophet say? He said that the voice will be in the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; The voice of God, &gt;&gt; whether you say anything, whether you never preach a message, the voice of God is in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's in you. How does it come in me? You simply surrender to it. &gt;&gt; I simply had to. They said, "Lay there." I laid there. Put your arm out. I put my arm out. Clench your fist. I clenched my fist. Said, "Now this just going to be a little prick. Sometimes it's a little prick, too. Surrender here. &gt;&gt; Raise up your hands. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh God, be merciful to me. Oh God, increase my faith. Oh God, I believe your word." &gt;&gt; And just expect a little prick. &gt;&gt; Might come with a little prick. You need to do this. &gt;&gt; Need to go there. Lay down there. Go there. Make that thing right. Just a little prick. But then it it starts coming in. Drip, drip, drip, drip. Every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line. Hallelujah. You're not getting isotopes. You're not getting nuclear medicine. You're getting heavenly medicine. &gt;&gt; That medicine doesn't only tell people where you stand and who you are. And it screams out they're believers. &gt;&gt; It's not just how you look. It's not just the long hair, the dress, or or or or how you, you know, just how you appear. It's not that, &gt;&gt; but there's something emanate out from you. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it works. &gt;&gt; And in the hour of trial, it really worked. And when I saw it really work, I sat and saw it work is when we were in China. That's the first time I actually saw it work. I saw it with my eyes. I sat on a chair hour after hour after hour with the deepest peace. There I am. I didn't know that. I didn't know if my wife even knew. I didn't know where I was going from here. I didn't know how long we're going to be here. And nothing bothered me. I just sat there and police coming in and police going out. And they would come in and walk around a wee bit back and forth. And it just came upon me. The power of the Lord Jesus Christ, the power of the Holy Ghost is wrenching what these men have been indoctrinated in and wrenching them down to surrender. &gt;&gt; And I realize greater is he that is in me than he that's in this entire nation, &gt;&gt; in this entire communist government. Greater is heal. Greater is he that is in you than is in this uh decrepit &gt;&gt; pleasure mad &gt;&gt; nation that we live in. Greater is he than this material world. Greater is he that's in you. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting to hear it from this congregation. &gt;&gt; You ought to thank him for that. &gt;&gt; Got to say, I believe that, brother. You may not feel it, but you want to say, "I believe that." And let it drip in. Is that God's word? Greater is he that's in you. I don't care what your circumstances are. I don't care what you're going through. I don't care what the devil has said to you. Greater is this word than what Satan has spoke. &gt;&gt; God raises up men and women of faith. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just hear about the gospel. I want to say it. &gt;&gt; This world has a right to say it. It shall be light in the evening time. Same one who said let there be light said there shall be light in the evening time. There shall be light in the evening time. Is it evening time? We're not bringing darkness. We're bringing light. &gt;&gt; You I want you to be able to say I want you to say it. Zachchariah said, "But it shall be light in the evening time." And I want you to say, I am that light. &gt;&gt; I am that scripture. &gt;&gt; I am that verse in flesh. &gt;&gt; And if you can't say that, you need to say it so it'll drip in. &gt;&gt; You need to surrender to it. &gt;&gt; Need to say, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; And it'll drip in. &gt;&gt; Lay here. Do that. Say that. Put your arm out here. I say, "Reach out and touch him. reach out and believe him. Let the word go from the here, from the ear and the mind down to the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The time slips away on us, doesn't it? the life that we now live and the sound and after Revelation 10:7 we don't have any question that has happened and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound we say oh a man I heard it I've heard that sound I've heard that message oh says says, "John, you take this book and you eat it." He says, "And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and I ate it up, and it was in my mouth, sweet as honey, and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter." And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations, and tongues, and kings." You realize we may talk about Pakistan. We may talk about nuclear powers. We may talk about the Soviet Union, about Russia and all the rest of it and these superpowers. But let's talk about the super church. &gt;&gt; When was there a day when we could prophesy from nation around the globe until this time &gt;&gt; and here it is and even this service and your voice on this service and your hand raised gone in the picture gone into the satellite gone around the globe as a testimony. There's a people there in Cloverdale that believes this word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You think it does not affect you young people, you may not even say a word. Say, "Okay, the uh the choir is going to get up and sing the junior choir, whatever more." Sometime I don't even hear the words. My hearing is not that great. But I see what I see is a group maybe 50, 60, 70 standing here and there's a sound. say, "Where do you find these kind of young people?" &gt;&gt; Individually, you might say, "Well, I've got my problem. I've got my weaknesses. I've got my temptations." Greater is he that's being pumped into you. Greater is he that's being dripped into you than anything that the world can do. &gt;&gt; All you have to do so when the world says, "Give me your arm." You say, "Not a chance. &gt;&gt; Give me your hand of fellowship." Not a chance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Spiritually speaking, if you have to clench your fist, use it for a good purpose. &gt;&gt; Give the devil a one, two, three. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you folks are enjoying this, but I'm enjoying it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You must prophesy again. And brother Brando says about this bitter in the belly. I thought about that when he said it's when it's being digested. &gt;&gt; You hear it? &gt;&gt; When it's being digested, &gt;&gt; you got to take this message and digest it. &gt;&gt; And he says in in this and he said in this sevenfold book of seven redemption plans has been brought to us. I underlined that has been brought to us. You believe this messenger, &gt;&gt; this book has been brought to us. &gt;&gt; Now, what do we do with it? &gt;&gt; Has been brought to us. And that's what's this book holds. And he says, we're going to get it over in the 10th chapter where the mighty angel proclaimed something. And he had a little book that John had to eat. And when he did, he got it in his belly and it was bitter, but in his lips it was sweet. He says, "And when you digest it, then it gets bitter." Everybody's against you. When you digest it, why? When you digest it, gets into your entire system. &gt;&gt; Then people begin to see what it is. And you and and you've all experienced this. &gt;&gt; You You arrive in a situation and this should just be just normal. And suddenly you suddenly you can't even understand this antagonism is I got on a plane once I and my wife in another country we got on the plane and sat down we were in India sat down and there was a white girl sitting right in front of us sitting right against the window and I was sitting against the window and she started having everything just short of convulsions. And she was so angry. She became so angry just as we sat down. And she began to, you know, hit at the seat and like this and speak out. And she was just totally totally demon-possessed. And the spirit in her was waring unbelievably. And she went on and went on and I just knew what it was. What do you do at a time like that? Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ, you might as well settle down because I'm not going any place. &gt;&gt; I was in a meeting and there's a young native uh Indian young man and they told me, "Oh, this young man is here. He's sitting in a sitting right against the wall towards the back of the church." And the and the brothers gave me a message. this young man, he disturbs a meeting because he's demonpossessed and they haven't been able to do anything with him and it was only a moment or two and he broke loose and three or four men or maybe more than that tried to get control of him. I'm sitting on the platform. I've got to preach in a few minutes. I've been called there to preach and here's this taking place and they're trying to manhandle him. I bowed my head and I said something like this. Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ, I bind you &gt;&gt; and you shall not disturb this meeting. And they got him back sitting in the in the seat and he had a he had a red bandana like one of those cowboy bandanna handkerchiefs and he had that in his hand and he began to twist on that and that's what he did for the next hour or so while I preached. He just twisted on that thing and that's as far as he could get because God was not going to have the congregation robbed of the preaching of the word and Satan was bound. Greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. Greater is he than the temptation. &gt;&gt; I don't say those things to give myself any credit. I just say those things because it's so simple and it's so true. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to practice it. &gt;&gt; He says, "And when he did, and then when he digested, he said, then people it it gets bitter. Everybody telling you you're a holy roller or you're this or you're that or you're the other. See, he said, or they say you're off your head. It's hard to digest it. But when you're testifying of his glory, it's sweet in your lips. That's all. &gt;&gt; What makes it better? When you become a believer, there's a new consciousness. I just look up and say, "Brother Paul Neighbor, God bless you, brother Paul, I've read your emails and what you've digested and what you've gone through recently has been because the message gave you a new consciousness and this congregation doesn't know you is asking brother Paul what he's gone through, but Satan like to drag him to very very difficult places the world and the system of the world because his conscious the inner consciousness they talk about in these eastern religions and I'm not off my subject listen to me good they talk about oh they look at the heavens and they look at the stars and they look at the moon and all these things and they get into the you know the astronomy and and it speaks to you and you tie Tie that together with some yoga and some some things and you'll you'll get a new consciousness. Well, you probably will, but it won't be a godly consciousness. &gt;&gt; And then you look within yourself, you look within yourself, you see a big dark pit. &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, you look into the face and the glory of God, and you look into the scriptures, you look into the promise of God, you will get a new consciousness. In the places you used to go, you can't go anymore. And the things you used to say, you can't say anymore. And the things you used to say, it's all right. I'll just go along with you. You can't do it anymore. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist had a new consciousness. And he said to the Herod, "It's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." And that cost him his head. &gt;&gt; In the prime of life, it cost him his head. &gt;&gt; You and I might have wondered about that if it happened here in Cloverdale Bible Way. is somebody that says well surely he could have adjusted a wee bit surely could have compromised a wee bit I tell you what it can be can get very very bitter can cost a person a good job can because I said I have a consciousness I can't do that &gt;&gt; I've counseled with brothers sitting right here in this church said uh uh I'm driving a truck but when I go through the when I go through the wave scales they want me to lie &gt;&gt; and I can't do If you can't lie, then you can't have the job. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? You have to lie to have a job. Lie to feed your family. And people have said because I got a new consciousness. I can't do that. &gt;&gt; I can't go there anymore. And you'll find that. I was with a group of people from a very very spiritual place as far as this message is concerned. I'm kind of letting it all out and I hope you don't mind. And these people were from a top-notch believer's church. And I said to them, "What do you young people do for your entertainment?" He said, "We go to movies." You do? I got saved from that. &gt;&gt; How does the Holy Ghost save me from movies and then take other people and bring them into the message and that's what they have for their entertainment? Tell you what, friends, I've seen enough just on screens and in hotel rooms. There isn't a movie in the country that comes out of Hollywood that's worth looking at. &gt;&gt; They got all kinds of influences and all kinds of innuendos and all kinds of perverted stuff they're putting across to you. And it's not exactly what you see, it's what they infer. &gt;&gt; It's how they're educating the people. I say to you that have families, see to it that your children don't see that stuff. &gt;&gt; I asked a congregation here just a few few weeks ago in a in a in a large meeting, how many have heard things you wished you had never heard? And you've seen things you wish you had never seen. And I would say it'd be 100% of us here today. We saw things and we've heard things we'd been better off. We had never seen it &gt;&gt; and never heard it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe a separated life is better for you. &gt;&gt; That stuff is poison. &gt;&gt; It's poison. &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes. I I I'm sorry. a new consciousness, a higher standard of the revealed word, a heightened sense of what's right and what's wrong. There's so many voices claiming all this a new a new dawn, especially this time of the year, a new dawn of a new consciousness. I wouldn't. Paul said in Timothy, but evil men and seducers shall wax worse. That means increase worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. But continue thou, and that's you, and me in the things which thou hast heard and learned, and hast been assured of, knowing, listen this last phrase, knowing of whom thou hast learned them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All kinds of people stand for what they have believed to be the truth. But you know what's important is where was the source? &gt;&gt; Where did it come from? Right. &gt;&gt; I had a conversation with a young man once out of Bible school &gt;&gt; and he wanted to come around the edge of the message and you know just he was looking at it. So I came onto the subject of the serpent seed and went through the scripture. He couldn't say anything. He fell silent. But he said, "Well," he said, "I don't want to follow a man. I just want to follow Christ." You've all heard that. I said, "Okay." I said, "How are things at Bible school this year?" "Oh." He said, "You know, not bad. You know me." He says, "I'm not a great student." "Yeah." I said, "Yeah. Uh, did you have to study hard?" "Yeah." Yeah. I said, "You know, study pretty hard. You just wrote your exams. How do you do in your exams? Well, he said, you know, kind of average sort of thing. So, but you studied hard. Yeah. He said, you know, I studied. I said, uh, what did you study? And he felt totally silent because he knew the trap door had shut. &gt;&gt; And when the trap door was shut, I didn't give up. I said, men's words, books written by men. So, we're studying men's words. Who are you following &gt;&gt; this business? The devil throwing it up. Are you following a man? They're following men. They're following women. &gt;&gt; Following all kinds of godless ideas, dreamed up in some hatched up in some man's mind what he thinks the Bible is. I like to have a man that has a source stand behind the pulpit, say, "It's thus sayeth the Lord." and then have him say, "If God doesn't come now &gt;&gt; and vindicate or manifest what I spoken as being the truth, then don't believe me." &gt;&gt; I like to hear that. I've asked Catholics, "Do you ever hear a pope say that?" &gt;&gt; No, they've never heard a pope say that. You've never had a general overseer. You've never had a bishop say that. But a prophet can say that because he knows that God's going to come on the scene. And all of you people here listening to my voice, you're under You're under responsibility to acknowledge that. &gt;&gt; It's in your hands now. You got to say, "What do I do with that?" &gt;&gt; That is true. &gt;&gt; That's not only in book. That's on tape. You can hear it with your own ears. &gt;&gt; You don't have to listen to me. Go home, get the tape. You'll get that same thing. If if he doesn't come now and prove that, &gt;&gt; then I'm false. But here comes the invisible God on the scene and proves it in infallible infallibility of the word. &gt;&gt; Seducers will increase and they certainly have. Now I'm go I'm closing in just a couple minutes. What is our life saying? Not what our words are saying, but what is our life saying? The Bible says that the spirit and the bride say. &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? Do you believe that? You just walk down a street. You walk into a walk into a grocery store. You walk into a restaurant and they just see not everybody, but they see they see there's a aura. There's a there's a presence, a very real presence. And something down in their heart is echoing, "Come, come. You can have this. You can be like this." And they look at you and they see that you're free. Oh, how many bound people there is in the world? Bound. and they look upon someone and in their face there's a sound that says I'm free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's a sound that says I'm alive. &gt;&gt; I don't need the things of the world. I have a living Christ. I have a spirit within me that's not of this world. I have a heavenly divine spirit within me. &gt;&gt; And it only says one word. Come. Come. Somebody sees that. Somebody sees that. I'm giving you personal testimonies here today and I hope you don't mind. It's the only service we're having and I will be closing soon. And you perhaps heard this account before. But my wife and I were sitting on a plane. We were going to South Africa and we got offloaded in the Canary Islands where they refuel. I don't know if it was the Canary Islands, one of the islands off the coast of Africa and we had to wait over two, three days and the planes coming through were packed and finally they said we could go on standby for this big jumbo jet 747. So I went there way way early. There was no staff, no staff at all at the counters for South African Airlines. And soon as a staff, soon as a two, three girls came up, one came to a counter and I went there and I was actually first. I was standing right there. The lady's right here. A woman's right on this side of me. And she'd wanted to be first, but she wasn't first. And she just went like this and just moved me out of the way physically until she was first. And you know what that does to me? I'd like to hear you laugh like that because it does the same thing to you. Get her a piece of my mind. And then I thought, well, you know, let her unload first. And they were after seats and we're after seats. And she had her whole family there. And she's telling her, whoa. said, "They offloaded us and we've been in a hotel and I need to get my family and we're five people." I thought, "Oh my goodness." You know, there's only a certain amount of seats on standby. And then I got there and then we went and sat in a a big open area. The counters were all over here and there's like a row of seats there and about this much distance. And my wife and I were sitting here and I looked across at that family, grown children in their late teens. And I thought, why that woman's rude? She's so rude and loud. And I started having compassion for her husband. Have to go home with that at night and listen to that. And then they called for everybody to go to the loading gate. She will all go to the loading gate. And we're all crowded there. And she's ahead of us again. And she says to her family, because they only got one first class seat and you know they actually put my my wife and I in first class. Those are the only seats they had. So uh and she says to her husband says, "Oh, let me go." Because they only had one seat. Let me go. I've never been first class. So they all surrendered and she was in first class. And I have to confess in my heart I was saying, "God, not anywhere near us. And when we get in there, our seats were up into the hump going up the little circle. And here she is going up that circle stairway. So I knew she was up in the same area. And then there was a, you know, two seats facing each other, these big nice easy swinging seats like that. And uh my wife as we got there first my wife sit her and while I was sitting her this woman just punk got in my seat. So now we've got about eight hours in the flight and she said now I can't even talk to my wife as I have to find another seat up there and I'm I'm some distance away. About four hours into the flight, I get up and I go to the washroom and this woman says to my wife, "What does your husband do?" She says, "He's a minister." She said, "I've been observing you while we sat in the airport, while you sat across from us." And she says, "I've been watching you and observing you." And she says, "You have a clean cleanness about you." And she said, "It's not on your face being clean, but she said it's something from within. &gt;&gt; And you have a cleanness." And she says, "What is it?" and she just blasted the door wide open and from then till we landed my wife witnessed to her about Christ and about the believers in South Africa. You understand? If id let that self-will go and pushed her out of the way, we'd have never had that testimony. So it was a matter of surrendering to what God says we are to be, the kind of light we are to be. And then I'm saying why we said nothing, never said a word, but the life was sounding. I like to say to you, brothers and sisters, my friends, this is kind of my New Year's, my New Year's service. You're going to go into this year as lights in a dark place. Perhaps never speaking, but your life is sounding out. And it is saying, "Come." It is speaking of cleanness. It is speaking of something holy. It's speaking of something that's unearly in this Leodysian time. In this dark age, people have enough darkness They need to see some light. &gt;&gt; And the elect of God, whoever they are, they will pursue it. They will follow after it. And they will come to know the same Lord Jesus Christ revealed who you are manifesting &gt;&gt; in this time. God bless you. I'd like to just have a word of prayer with you. Let's bow. Father, what a treasure we have. We are so so privileged to be able to to to have been called to be lights in this world. To have been called to be the voice of God, the extended voice of this message and this messenger to echo out and to speak of its reality in our lives. Oh God. And we've proven it. We've proven it, Lord. We've seen it active in our families. We've seen it active in our children. We see what you have accomplished and what you have achieved. And so I pray, Father, now you will hear my prayer for I ask your blessings. I ask your blessings to be doubled upon the people. I ask your blessings to be poured out upon the people. And I pray that a blessing of a desire will be created in each of our hearts for our individual walk with you. Oh God, granted I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. And may there be a surrendering Lord of each heart. And while I pray, if you feel a need in your heart to have a deeper surrender to God, God lead me. Why don't you raise your hand right now while I continue to pray? Lord, you see the hands more than the hands, you see the hearts. And we are testifying we desire to be surrendered vessels unto the Lord in this hour, oh God. And I think of the song, Once this life is over, then what? What will it be, oh God, when we cross over? And so we want to be faithful to you. We want to be faithful to you, Lord Jesus. I pray, Father, that you will give us that faithful, faithful spirit. And now, Lord, demonstrate your word. I've spoken it. Now demonstrate it. I ask those that need to be freed from something that may have been holding them back within their within their own nature, their own character, and they feel a complex of some sort. Let them lay it aside. Let them realize that what you are dripping into them now by the Holy Spirit, by the word of God, you will manifest it, Lord. It's not us that manifest it. You manifest it in us. And we thank you for that the irrevocable promise of God. All glory to your name we pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I want to just sing a verse or two of a song faith of our fathers living still. And would you have just a a few minutes? I I want to just show you uh a few pictures actually of the camp and what has been taking place. And it's only it'll only be a few minutes. Will it be all right? &gt;&gt; All right. Let's stand and change our position as we sing a couple verses of this song. Faith of our fathers living still. of our father living still in fire and how our hearts be with that glory. as our father. We will be true to [Music] death.
