[0:00] Help me find you.
[0:04] How I need your touch. Maybe this is
[0:09] your prayer this morning. Lord, find my
[0:11] dry and broken places.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Find my dry,
[0:18] broken places.
[0:22] So thirsty.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, forgive me if I've wandered.
[0:30] Oh Lord, forgive me
[0:35] if I want
[0:41] away from you.
[0:46] You are all
[0:50] I ever needed.
[0:55] Lord come
[0:58] and make me
[1:03] Lord pour your spirit out.
[1:08] Oh, and fall is like the rain
[1:14] saturated.
[1:17] Oh my thirsty
[1:20] soul and come and pour fresh on me.
[1:26] Lord, fill my cup again.
[1:30] Heal my heart.
[1:33] my heart
[1:35] and take me home.
[1:40] I need you.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; I need
[1:44] you now.
[1:46] Pour your spirit. Let's just stand as we
[1:49] sing it again. Pour your spirit out,
[1:51] Lord, and pour your spirit out.
[1:57] Your fall is like the rain.
[2:03] Saturate
[2:06] my thirsty soul.
[2:10] Come and fall fresh on me.
[2:16] My power again.
[2:19] My heart.
[2:21] My heart
[2:23] and make me home.
[2:29] I need
[2:31] you now
[2:33] pour your spirit
[2:36] out.
[2:39] Hallelujah. Is that your prayer this
[2:42] morning that his spirit would just fall
[2:44] and have total liberty in our midst.
[2:46] Lord, heal those who need healing. Oh
[2:49] God, deliver those who need deliverance.
[2:51] Lord Jesus, many of us have received the
[2:54] baptism but need another filling. Oh
[2:56] God, just pour your spirit in and fill
[2:57] our cups once more. Hallelujah. As we go
[3:01] to prayer, let's just sing that chorus.
[3:02] Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up.
[3:06] Amen.
[3:08] Ooh, fill my cup,
[3:12] Lord. As the brothers would come and
[3:13] prepare to receive the offering also
[3:16] it up,
[3:18] Lord.
[3:20] Oh, come and quench
[3:25] this thirsting of my soul
[3:33] and bread of heaven.
[3:38] Feed me till I want no more.
[3:45] Here's my cup.
[3:49] Fill it up
[3:51] and make me.
[3:54] Let's just lift our hands and we sing it
[3:56] again. Fill my cup Lord. Fill my cup
[4:01] Lord. Oh, overflowing this morning. We
[4:05] lift it up to you, Lord Jesus.
[4:07] Hallelujah. Come and quench this
[4:09] thirsting hunger.
[4:13] is thirsting
[4:15] out of my soul.
[4:28] I want
[4:34] my love
[4:39] and take me home.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[4:48] Amen. Brother Tim Dog, could I ask you
[4:50] please to come open the service for us?
[4:53] Amen. Our Brother William Smouse is just
[4:55] asking that we'd remember him in prayer
[4:57] for an unspoken prayer request. Also for
[5:00] our brother Mike Kucon who is still in
[5:02] need of prayer.
[5:04] And our sister Debbie Paris is asking
[5:06] prayer for a gentleman staying at the
[5:07] camp. He's requesting prayer for his
[5:09] sister Nenah who has kidney failure.
[5:12] They ask that we would remember her.
[5:14] Also we want to hold up our sister Carol
[5:16] Reagan in prayer this morning. Her
[5:18] needing of a healing touch for her heart
[5:20] this morning.
[5:22] Amen. many needs. If there's something
[5:23] on your heart that you just like to lift
[5:25] up before the Lord with an upraised hand
[5:27] and we know that he sees every hand and
[5:28] even this is an act of faith when you
[5:30] raise your hand and say, "God, you see
[5:32] my need." Amen. He's already provided.
[5:35] He's Jehovah Gyra. He's Jehovah Ni. He
[5:38] fights our battles for us. Jehovah
[5:40] Shalom. If you need peace this morning,
[5:42] he's Jehovah Rafa, the healer. Jehovah
[5:44] Shama. Hallelujah. God is with us. If
[5:46] you believe that this morning as we join
[5:48] our hearts together in prayer, let it be
[5:50] a prayer of faith this morning as our
[5:51] brother Tim comes. Amen. God bless you.
[5:53] Thank you, brother Tim.
[6:00] Wonderful, wonderful heavenly father.
[6:04] Your name is wonderful,
[6:06] marvelous,
[6:08] the counselor, the prince of pre peace,
[6:11] the mighty God,
[6:13] the everlasting father. Everything that
[6:15] we have need of, oh Lord, is in you.
[6:18] Lord, as we sense your presence so near,
[6:22] Lord, we want to say like the songwriter
[6:24] say, "Pass me not, oh gentle Savior.
[6:27] Hear my humble cry."
[6:30] While on others you are calling, do not
[6:32] pass me by, Lord. Lord, come by our pew.
[6:37] Come by the chair where we sit in this
[6:39] morning, oh God. Come by in this
[6:42] service, Lord. And there'll be others
[6:43] that are out on the internet that are
[6:45] streaming, Lord, that are praying. Come
[6:47] by our way this morning, Lord. Lord,
[6:50] you're the same there as you are here,
[6:52] Lord. You always come where you're
[6:54] invited. You are the great gentleman, oh
[6:57] God. You accept our invitation. And
[6:59] Lord, we invite you to come and have
[7:02] preeminence this morning. We invite you,
[7:05] Lord, to open up the word to us this
[7:07] morning. We invite you, Lord, to pour in
[7:09] revelation into our lives. For how many
[7:12] times do we underestimate the value of
[7:15] revelation, oh God. But Lord, we esteem
[7:18] it highly this morning that you would
[7:20] open the word as your servant steps
[7:21] behind the sacred desk. Lord, you anoint
[7:24] his lips, his thoughts, oh Lord, that
[7:27] the words would come that come forth
[7:28] would not be the words of a man, but
[7:31] Lord, that they be the inspiration of
[7:32] the Holy Spirit this morning, that you
[7:35] would do supernaturally amongst us,
[7:37] stretching forth your hand to do mighty
[7:40] works amongst your people. All things
[7:43] are possible, Lord. We are believing and
[7:46] your word is true. And Lord, we have
[7:49] these requests here this morning. Our
[7:51] sister Reagan's in need this morning,
[7:53] Lord. We bear her up before you. Our
[7:56] brother Donniey's wife, oh Lord, is help
[7:58] me. Lord, may you come to her even now
[8:01] where she is, oh God. Lord, may you
[8:03] quicken her mortal body with the virtue
[8:05] that was loosed at Calvary. For by your
[8:08] stripes, she was healed. Oh God, this
[8:11] woman that the request is in, oh Lord,
[8:14] that she has some some kind of kidney
[8:17] failure, Lord. Lord, you know her need.
[8:21] Lord, you're able to repair the kidneys
[8:23] for you made them. You are our creator
[8:28] and there is still a balm in Gilead.
[8:31] There is still a healer there. May you
[8:33] touch her mortal body. May you touch her
[8:36] soul, Lord. We pray. Lord, remember
[8:38] brother Mike Cucon tonight. Each and
[8:41] everyone, brother Smiles, each one,
[8:43] Lord. Father, we're remembering the
[8:45] needs even represented by the uplifted
[8:48] hand. We in our human frailty could not
[8:51] remember each one. Lord, we don't even
[8:54] have the strength to help one another.
[8:57] But Lord, if we would get ourselves out
[8:59] of the way and let your virtue flow
[9:01] through us, Lord, I believe that you can
[9:04] meet every need this morning.
[9:07] We ask Lord for the supernatural
[9:10] that which is beyond human control. We
[9:14] ask it in faith believing and we ask
[9:16] your blessing upon this service now. May
[9:19] you take control of every part of it as
[9:22] we give our offerings as a form of
[9:24] worship unto you. May you take it and
[9:27] multiply it and use it for your glory.
[9:30] We commit all things to you, Father, in
[9:32] the wonderful name of Jesus Christ.
[9:35] Amen.
[9:48] Amen. You may have your seats. I was
[9:50] just thinking as brother Tim was praying
[9:52] for our sister Carol that song that
[9:54] Sister Linda, Sister Dwan, Sister
[9:56] Marilyn sang their last CD. Lord, lay
[9:59] your nail scarred hand upon my heart.
[10:01] Amen. May God do that for our sister
[10:03] Carol even this morning. Amen. And grant
[10:06] her a healing.
[10:08] Amen. I'm going to ask our brother
[10:10] George to come and get ready to sing for
[10:12] us. We do have a wonderful announcement
[10:14] we want to share from our brother Aaron
[10:17] and our sister Jessica Hardy. They would
[10:20] like to thank the Lord for the arrival
[10:21] of their daughter Lydia Kate on Thursday
[10:25] the 17th. 8 lb 5 oz. 21 in at 10:47 p.m.
[10:30] Do we have a picture, brother? Is it
[10:32] working for us? I know we have one.
[10:35] We'll give it a second.
[10:38] Cutting edge technology.
[10:43] Amen. Well, we'll we'll wait for that.
[10:46] You can put it up when you get it,
[10:47] brother.
[10:54] Oh, maybe we can look at it.
[10:57] We'll just carry on. But when you get
[10:59] it. Yeah. There we go. Praise the Lord.
[11:01] Amen.
[11:05] Amen.
[11:07] Bless the Hardy family, the Snow family,
[11:10] the grandbaby. Praise the Lord. Amen. As
[11:14] our brother George comes to sing for us,
[11:15] why don't we just sing that chorus?
[11:17] Spirit of God move.
[11:20] Amen.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; Oh spirit of God, move
[11:30] and write your word in my heart.
[11:35] Fill my holy

[11:53] so that you

[12:06] second verse I recognize your voice oh
[12:10] Lord I recognize your voice
[12:15] and I understood the call.
[12:19] Lord, help me not to faint,
[12:23] but stand and overcome.
[12:27] Lord, I just want to please you. That's
[12:32] all I want to do. So from my soul now I
[12:38] cry to you.

[13:46] I want
[13:49] so that you
[13:52] can come.
[13:57] Lord and will be.
[14:03] Amen.
[14:07] God bless you church. It's good to be
[14:10] back in your midst.
[14:12] The Bible say where two or three of us
[14:14] are gathered that God is there in our
[14:16] midst. I'm going to sing this song says
[14:18] Jesus is passing this way.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; So let's just hold on. Amen.
[14:41] Is there a rat that is wondering,

[22:13] &gt;&gt; we're indeed happy to be here behind the
[22:16] pulpit today and be able to unload our
[22:20] heart.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Happy to see all your uh smiling
[22:25] faces and and in anticipation. Some that
[22:29] can't be here this morning have already
[22:32] text and said uh I'm not I'm not so
[22:36] close there, but I will be very close.
[22:39] I'm listening and streaming and being in
[22:41] the meeting.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:44] I really enjoyed the the song. Brother
[22:48] George, our brother George and his wife,
[22:53] Sister Hope,
[22:56] I don't made up pronouncing exactly
[22:58] right. They're from Nigeria
[23:01] and they have uh immigrated
[23:05] uh and are going to be residents here.
[23:08] tell you is it really humbling when you
[23:10] see people have
[23:12] &gt;&gt; have gone through such a
[23:15] uh a lot of work to and just identify a
[23:19] place and and I trust that it'll be just
[23:22] exactly the diet that will bless you and
[23:24] your family. Brother George,
[23:27] &gt;&gt; very nice also to have our brother
[23:29] Dennis McGaryi here. God bless you and
[23:32] your daughter Charity I believe. It's
[23:34] nice to have you here as well. and
[23:38] brother Dennis is brother David McGary's
[23:40] brother. So, we're well acquainted with
[23:44] the uh with the family and the church
[23:47] there in Dallas.
[23:50] And uh we're thankful for each one that
[23:54] are here.
[23:56] Next week, uh this Sunday service will
[24:00] be as normal as regular Sunday morning
[24:03] service and Sunday evening.
[24:05] and it'll be Easter.
[24:08] Uh desire that you all will be here.
[24:11] I'll be speaking, Lord willing, an
[24:13] Easter service in in Switzerland. And I
[24:17] think this will be probably my last
[24:20] visit there. I keep saying that. Uh
[24:24] brother Donnie Reagan was to be there
[24:26] and still may be there. Uh they've been
[24:30] really counting on being in the services
[24:32] there. And brother Craig Bour is also
[24:36] brother Murphy is there and brother
[24:39] Murphy's largely going because the
[24:42] Chinese Bible is completed and there'll
[24:45] be many ministers from Europe
[24:49] uh all over Europe
[24:51] from Italy and from Croatia. Brother
[24:54] Jonathan Larga and his family plans to
[24:57] be there and we are just uh really
[25:03] uh really privileged when I speak of the
[25:05] Chinese Bible. You know, something goes
[25:07] on in my heart that perhaps I would like
[25:10] to convey to you and that is that this
[25:15] uh massive country of China
[25:20] with more people than is all in North
[25:22] America. many more people, probably
[25:25] three times the number.
[25:28] And God somehow for some reason
[25:32] did not allow or did not arrange for
[25:36] brother Brandham to actually visit that
[25:39] country. And I have wondered if it's
[25:41] just something that God has allowed for
[25:44] the bride of Jesus Christ to take the
[25:47] message there. And I have seen such an
[25:51] unusual
[25:52] movement uh taking place. And then and
[25:57] then to what a startling thing it was,
[26:00] what a surprise it was to find that the
[26:04] Chinese people just the the nature that
[26:07] they have to be precise and their work
[26:10] ethics and they begin to find that when
[26:13] when brother Brham read a certain
[26:16] scripture and that all happened from up
[26:19] there behind that little window where
[26:22] brother Murphy labored freely. really
[26:26] labored and just
[26:28] got the messages, translated the
[26:30] messages until the people have said over
[26:34] there, you are brother Brandham's voice
[26:36] to us otherwise we would not know of
[26:39] this prophet and they listen diligently
[26:44] and then would hear that the scriptures
[26:47] were not the same as they were read as
[26:50] brother Brandham read them in in his
[26:52] Bible. They were not the same. So they
[26:55] just automatically made notation and
[26:58] diarized it. You know how long ago that
[27:01] was? 18 years over 18 years ago.
[27:06] And they kept it and people all over
[27:08] from different places within that great
[27:10] massive country. They kept the
[27:14] uh those discrepancies
[27:17] because they it they had never once
[27:20] voiced we we need another Bible. But it
[27:23] just became it kind of rose out of the
[27:26] &gt;&gt; just like an an unheard voice
[27:30] &gt;&gt; rose out of amongst the people that the
[27:32] Bible isn't it's not a good Bible. It's
[27:36] not an accurate Bible
[27:38] and uh then a decision was taken here
[27:42] that uh
[27:44] no major didn't seem like a major
[27:46] decision just said well we need to
[27:49] change we need to do how many how many
[27:52] mistakes are there in the Bible well a
[27:55] fundamental group in Hong Kong had had
[27:59] done the Old Testament we heard that
[28:01] they had done the Old Testament and had
[28:04] made 30,000 th000 plus correctors
[28:07] corrections 30,000 and they said it's
[28:10] it's open domain help yourself so we
[28:14] took it and we said well we'll do the
[28:18] New Testament first John I think it's 1
[28:21] John 5 and 7 there are three that give
[28:24] record in heaven the father the spirit
[28:28] and the word and these three are one
[28:31] that verse doesn't exist and that's a
[28:34] major verse verse.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; And so it finally came to the place
[28:38] where something needs to be done. And
[28:40] while Brother Murphy right here behind
[28:43] that window is doing the New Testament
[28:46] verse by verse,
[28:49] line by line and word by word.
[28:53] It becomes troubling that the Old
[28:56] Testament still is not for the verses of
[29:00] in the Psalms for example that refer to
[29:02] mercy and grace, they just use one word
[29:06] and that is love. And uh it's just not
[29:10] it's just not correct. And so, Brother
[29:14] Murphy behind that window
[29:16] laid aside
[29:19] the translation work, the current
[29:21] translation work, still keeping up with
[29:23] the messages, but went back to Genesis
[29:27] 1.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; In the beginning,
[29:30] &gt;&gt; God created the heaven and the earth and
[29:33] went through word by word by word
[29:37] through the entire Bible. I talked to
[29:39] him on one occasion. And he said, "I'm
[29:40] in Job." I tell you what, friends, you
[29:43] can't say thank you enough. You can't
[29:46] say thank God enough that God has people
[29:50] that will listen to his voice and give
[29:52] themselves unreservedly to see that
[29:56] someone else hears this glorious word.
[29:59] That's putting feet.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; That's putting feet to a testimony.
[30:03] That's putting feet to a life. And I
[30:06] have such an appreciation and finished
[30:08] it. It took 18 years, five years of
[30:11] doing just that until it was completed.
[30:14] And now that Bible is a beautiful,
[30:16] beautiful Bible. We're going to be
[30:18] taking it to Switzerland so that the
[30:21] people can see it, so the people can
[30:23] handle it. and brother and and brother
[30:26] uh Hammed's church in Nur Murphy'sboro,
[30:30] he said, "I just feel you should give it
[30:32] to the people so they can hold it in
[30:34] their hand as it goes by and have one
[30:37] after the other." And and uh I had to
[30:40] ask three times during the service,
[30:42] where is that Bible? Because they
[30:45] wouldn't pass it on. They wanted to keep
[30:47] holding it. And there's just something
[30:50] special, you know, when you get the
[30:51] Bible in your hand, doesn't matter what
[30:53] language it is, you just don't want to
[30:55] let go of it. And so anyway, we want to
[30:59] take some of those Bibles. But I want to
[31:02] let this congregation and all who are
[31:04] maybe streaming or connected one way or
[31:07] another, whether it be in Seattle or
[31:11] Victoria and the groups there. I I
[31:14] appreciate Brother Kyle getting the
[31:16] pictures of the meetings in Victoria.
[31:18] Thank you. That was very wonderful. But
[31:21] wherever they are, just to think that
[31:23] God has allowed and the prophet of God
[31:27] said that, you know, Jesus fulfilled the
[31:30] Old Testament and the bridal fulfill the
[31:32] New. We've got something to do
[31:35] &gt;&gt; and we're not here idly, friends. We're
[31:38] we're here with something to do. And we
[31:39] really appreciate that and appreciate
[31:42] every believer that is here.
[31:46] I want to I want to uh speak to you this
[31:49] morning and before we do I'm going to
[31:52] ask that brother Ryan will
[31:55] uh just lead in a in singing the course
[31:58] the unseen hand. Would you like to
[32:01] stand?
[32:07] You can be turning in your Bible if you
[32:09] would to 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter
[32:12] and we'll read.
[32:17] Just sing the chorus and then a verse.
[32:26] The unseen hand
[32:31] that I be
[32:35] this we land
[32:40] and some sweet day
[32:45] I'll reach last
[32:49] still guided by
[32:55] The unseen
[32:56] hand.
[32:59] There is an unseen
[33:04] hand to me
[33:08] that leads to
[33:13] I cannot see
[33:18] while you're
[33:22] this world of hope
[33:27] is still
[33:31] teach me as
[33:34] I go.
[33:36] I'm trusting to
[33:41] the unseen
[33:46] that guides me through
[33:50] this we
[34:04] still Guide it by
[34:09] the unseen
[34:11] hand.
[34:13] We'll pray now. Heavenly Father, we
[34:16] thank you for your unseen hand. Though
[34:20] it may be unseen, yet it's very, very
[34:22] real to us. We see your hand guiding us
[34:26] day by day in the affairs of life. We
[34:30] say, "Almighty Holy Spirit, we're so
[34:34] thankful for your presence. We've not
[34:36] gathered here in vain. We've not
[34:38] gathered here just as a church service.
[34:40] We've gathered here to worship the in
[34:43] invisible God made visible and living in
[34:46] the bodies of this believers by the
[34:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost. We pray,
[34:52] Father, that you will be honored today,
[34:54] Lord. Pray that your name will be upheld
[34:57] and blessed. We pray and ask that you'll
[34:59] bless this service. Father, guide the
[35:02] words. Oh God, I give myself to you. I
[35:06] pray, Lord, that the both speaker and
[35:08] hearers alike will be indeed fed. I need
[35:13] also to partake of the word of God.
[35:16] Strengthen us, oh Father. I pray for
[35:19] every sick and afflicted person that may
[35:22] be in this place. You already purchased
[35:25] and paid for our healing and
[35:26] deliverance. I pray Lord we may accept
[35:29] it as you have given it so freely.
[35:34] Bless all now we pray in the name of
[35:36] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[35:41] God bless you. Thank you musicians.
[35:46] I want to read u
[35:52] before we read the scripture. I have a
[35:58] a quote I'd like you to read with me.
[36:01] Wonder if we can just turn down these
[36:03] lights a little bit, please.
[36:10] But Jesus lived in a world that no one
[36:14] knew about. He was an odd person. He
[36:18] lived in a world of perfect faith in the
[36:21] perfect God in which he was. If we lived
[36:25] in a perfect faith of a Christian to
[36:28] what we are, I'd like you to notice
[36:31] those words, to what we are,
[36:35] we'd be a mystic to the world. The
[36:38] people wouldn't understand you.
[36:42] You'd walk in the spirit. What the
[36:44] spirit said you would do,
[36:47] what it forbid you would not do. Then
[36:51] the people begin to say, "You'd be a
[36:53] mystic to them."
[36:57] That's the way it is to all believers.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; They're a mistake. The people don't
[37:03] understand because they live in a world
[37:05] to themselves.
[37:07] Jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[37:10] could touch. The disciples couldn't
[37:13] understand him. When he spoke to them,
[37:16] they say this and then they said, "Why
[37:20] you talk in riddles?
[37:23] We do we don't understand this. How can
[37:26] this be?" See, they weren't in the world
[37:30] that he lived in. They couldn't
[37:33] understand him. Nobody could understand
[37:36] him.
[37:39] So when a man lives by faith and walks
[37:42] by faith, I mean substance faith, he is
[37:45] isolated from the entire world and
[37:49] becomes a new creature in Christ.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; There now you're getting into bride
[37:56] material.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; You're getting into rapturing condition.
[38:02] Now that means for each one of us, not
[38:07] just for the pastor, deacons, trustees.
[38:11] That means for the leoty. Every
[38:13] individual walks in a world with God
[38:16] alone. You're baptized into this
[38:19] kingdom.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; And there's nobody in there but you and
[38:23] God.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; He gives the orders and you pack them
[38:27] out. Whatever he says, there's not a
[38:31] shadow of a doubt nowhere. You walk
[38:33] right on. If the Lord says this, there's
[38:37] nobody in the world can talk you out of
[38:39] it.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[38:42] &gt;&gt; If he's If the Lord says this, there's
[38:44] nobody in the world that can talk you
[38:46] out of it. You go right on just the
[38:49] same. Now you're coming into perfect
[38:52] faith,
[38:53] &gt;&gt; perfect perfection. That cannot fail.
[38:57] that fails. That faith never fails. Yes,
[39:01] he was a mystic to them with his perfect
[39:04] faith. And so it is now with those who
[39:07] have perfect faith are a mystic to
[39:10] others.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, you can turn the lights
[39:14] back up. Thank you.
[39:17] We'll read out of 2 Corinthians the 4th
[39:20] chapter starting with verse 13 to 18.
[39:25] We having the same faith according as it
[39:29] is written, I believed and therefore I
[39:32] have spoken, we also believe and
[39:36] therefore speak, knowing that he which
[39:39] raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us
[39:42] up also by Jesus, and shall present us
[39:47] with you. For all things are for your
[39:51] sakes, that the abundant grace might
[39:54] through the thanksgiving of many redound
[39:58] to the glory of God. The word redounded
[40:01] is not one that's used often amongst us
[40:03] today, but it is to abound or overflow.
[40:07] It is to be abundantly furnished with or
[40:11] to have in abundance beyond measure. So
[40:14] it is saying that that through the
[40:17] thanksgiving of many of many abound to
[40:21] the glory of God. You see the focus is
[40:24] on the glory of God.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; For which cause we faint not but though
[40:29] our outward man perish yet the inward
[40:32] man is renewed day by day. For our light
[40:36] affliction which is but for a moment
[40:38] workketh for us a far more exceeding and
[40:41] eternal weight eternal weight of glory.
[40:44] 18th verse especially while we look not
[40:47] at the things which are seen but at the
[40:51] things which are not seen for the things
[40:54] which are seen are temporal but the
[40:57] things which are not seen are eternal.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your
[41:03] seats, but keep your Bible. You may want
[41:06] it open as we move along.
[41:12] I I want to speak to you
[41:15] on this subject. I want you all to think
[41:18] about these things. Oh, a minister who
[41:21] may think about something for weeks or
[41:23] even months and then finally comes down
[41:27] they study and study and then expect to
[41:30] unloaded in an hour and a half or two.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; So that's very that's very difficult
[41:37] but I will get right to it. I want to
[41:39] speak on the unfolding
[41:42] of eternity
[41:45] &gt;&gt; within time.
[41:48] We are creatures of time
[41:51] &gt;&gt; and the prophet also said we're
[41:53] creatures of eternity
[41:55] &gt;&gt; since the new birth. So I I was
[41:58] pondering these things. Is everything
[42:01] that happens to us
[42:04] is it just an event of time?
[42:10] Obviously some things are and some
[42:13] things perhaps are not. And I and I
[42:16] began to more I pondered it, this
[42:18] service developed out of that. And I'm
[42:21] here to say that
[42:24] uh much of what happens in the
[42:26] believer's life is of a of an eternal
[42:30] dimension and eternity actually
[42:34] and uh actually is taking place.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:38] uh
[42:40] there are aspects of spiritual
[42:43] perfection
[42:45] and sinlessness.
[42:48] I I'm thinking about this also and I'm
[42:50] just I'm just I'm not there even myself
[42:55] but I want to bring it to you. There are
[42:59] aspects
[43:01] that the prophet of God approached.
[43:04] There are things which he said which are
[43:07] very very difficult for us to
[43:10] confess
[43:12] about the sinlessness of the believer.
[43:16] We can get excited and we say amen to it
[43:19] but we go out those doors and we don't
[43:22] we don't live as though
[43:25] uh in that sinless state. And I don't
[43:28] mean without sin, but I mean without the
[43:32] knowledge
[43:33] of being guilty.
[43:37] How can he bore or bear have borne our
[43:40] guilt and us to be guiltless?
[43:44] There are so many aspects of that. Uh
[43:47] and the perfection of the bride of Jesus
[43:50] Christ, the perfection of her. And we
[43:54] can say, you know, on nice things and we
[43:57] get all enthused about it, but somehow
[44:00] we become so susceptible to defeat
[44:04] &gt;&gt; and the things of this world. And I I'd
[44:07] like to just I'm just these are just
[44:10] some initial statements and we'll go on
[44:13] into it, but this is Satan's Eden.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; And I don't think that's any surprise to
[44:20] anyone. This is Satan's Eden.
[44:23] The prophet said that that Lucifer
[44:28] wanted a shinier kingdom.
[44:31] And I can say that Satan has made a very
[44:34] shiny kingdom.
[44:36] And we have become so adapted
[44:40] and so educated and so cultivated to
[44:44] this kingdom. That's the problem. When
[44:47] we go out those doors, we suddenly get
[44:49] knocked sideways and we see something or
[44:52] we hear something and you know and and
[44:55] we get all disturbed and all troubled
[44:58] and I don't feel good or this happened
[45:00] or that happens and it's maybe
[45:02] economical. It's maybe from who knows
[45:06] what it where it comes from. It may come
[45:08] from peers. It may come from education.
[45:11] They come from the car broke down or the
[45:14] tires flat or something and and all of
[45:16] it has such an effect on and I I've just
[45:20] been asking myself why if we're if we're
[45:23] such eternal beings why are these things
[45:25] affecting us
[45:27] &gt;&gt; to such a degree and then we come in and
[45:29] get all happy and then go back out and
[45:34] just like ether it all disappears and I
[45:37] said something's wrong.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me?
[45:44] It's the effect of this shinier kingdom.
[45:46] So I begin to ask myself, are we eternal
[45:50] beings? And are we is eternal things
[45:53] happening?
[45:54] And I I believe that once this service
[45:57] is over, it will surprise you to see how
[46:00] many things that are eternal
[46:03] &gt;&gt; are actually unfolding in time.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the believer,
[46:09] &gt;&gt; we are eternal beings
[46:12] &gt;&gt; and eternity has merged
[46:15] into time.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And for the believer, the further we go
[46:20] in the the word of God, the word of God
[46:24] is eternal.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; It doesn't even belong within the time
[46:29] frame.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; It's eternal. It's an eternal word of
[46:33] God.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I believe that this will be
[46:36] a blessing to you.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Things that are seen, Apostle Paul says,
[46:42] are temporal.
[46:44] And temporal is is related to time.
[46:49] And eternal of course is related to
[46:51] eternity.
[46:53] Brother Vanom speaks. Now this is I'm
[46:56] giving you a quote not to give you a
[46:58] quote but to give you maybe a certain
[47:00] line out of the quote that it has a
[47:03] profound profound effect. Sometimes it's
[47:06] only one word
[47:08] or two words or one short sentence. But
[47:12] in Christ is the mystery of God
[47:14] revealed.
[47:16] It does come down to about one or two
[47:18] words.
[47:20] Now he said now God had a purpose. And
[47:22] you think oh yeah I've read that before.
[47:24] No, we're going to be reading it
[47:26] differently. God had a purpose and a
[47:29] hidden mystery.
[47:31] And that's what I want, brother Brennham
[47:33] says, that's what I want to speak on to
[47:37] the church this morning. The hidden
[47:40] mystery of God that ha that he had in
[47:44] his mind before the world it ever began.
[47:48] And and here's the line. And how
[47:53] it's
[47:55] it's unfolded. Not how I have unfolded
[47:58] it or how we have unfolded it. How it's
[48:03] unfolded. In other words, the mystery of
[48:06] God or the word of God, the thing that
[48:09] was hidden in God's mind. And then he
[48:12] goes on to say how it's unfolded itself
[48:17] right down to this present hour that
[48:21] we're living in.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; How it's unfolded. God's secret, God's
[48:28] mystery, how it has unfolded. It has its
[48:31] own power. It doesn't depend on a
[48:34] preacher to unfold it or someone else to
[48:37] unfold it. It's unfolded itself.
[48:40] This word of God has power within
[48:43] itself.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; You can sit on your hands all the rest
[48:45] of your life if you wish, but this will
[48:48] keep unfolding.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; People can have church and services and
[48:54] whatever format they want to have. They
[48:56] can go on and on week after week and and
[48:59] and and if they're not if they're not
[49:02] believers of the word, if they're not
[49:04] elect of the word of God, this will
[49:06] bypass them. they will continue on. And
[49:10] that's why the prophet speaks so harshly
[49:13] about denominations because
[49:15] denominations
[49:17] cast a a group into a certain truth or a
[49:20] certain and tongues is the evidence or I
[49:24] if I shake or if I do this or if I do
[49:27] that and and then people become fixed
[49:30] and that's the problem. God is you can't
[49:33] put God in a box. You can't even put him
[49:36] in a message box. He's not in a box.
[49:39] He's going to continue to fulfill and
[49:43] it's going to unfold itself. And so I
[49:46] come to the unfolding is literally the
[49:49] uh fulfilling
[49:51] of what God got in his mind as a
[49:55] mystery. It's going to unfold itself.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, how it's
[50:00] unfolded itself. I want to speak this
[50:02] morning on how it's unfolded itself down
[50:06] to this present hour that we're living
[50:08] in.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; It didn't stop unfolding.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham left
[50:16] &gt;&gt; and it's not preachers that unfold it,
[50:19] &gt;&gt; it's God that unfolds it.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; God continues to fulfill it.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; And you and I, our great our great
[50:28] challenge is to be in it.
[50:31] Let me be in it.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Let me be part of what's going on.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; And I want to stay so alert. And in
[50:37] order to do so, you got to make certain
[50:40] that this shiny world out here doesn't
[50:43] distract you,
[50:46] &gt;&gt; doesn't slow you down,
[50:48] &gt;&gt; doesn't dull our minds because that's
[50:51] what it's set up to do.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; We're not to have that effect upon us.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; And so how it's unfolded itself. And
[51:00] then he says, "And then you will
[51:01] understand clearly then you see on I
[51:05] believe what is being done."
[51:09] So I'm not inferring that we unfold it.
[51:12] Not you and I that do it, but the word
[51:15] in some special in some special
[51:18] revelation, but that the eternal word,
[51:21] the eternal word has and is unfolding
[51:25] itself right down to this present hour
[51:28] that we're living in.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; The word of God, the Bible, is a record
[51:33] of eternal events
[51:36] &gt;&gt; taking place in time.
[51:41] This is God's eternal word.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; So the fulfillment of this is eternal
[51:47] things,
[51:48] eternity, pieces of inter eternity
[51:52] happening within time.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; So I want you to think about that.
[51:58] Now the word of God is uh is a record of
[52:02] eternal events taking place in time. The
[52:05] unfolding
[52:07] is in the fulfillment. And I believe it
[52:10] requires spiritual revelation to
[52:14] recognize or see or hear the spiritual
[52:18] events in our time.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; With the passage of time, the scene
[52:24] changes due to civilization.
[52:27] So, we're living in a much different
[52:29] time.
[52:31] Uh,
[52:33] brother Paul Neighbor and Sister Heidi
[52:36] up there. I had to
[52:38] had to have a another look. He sent me a
[52:43] little link
[52:45] and uh the things that the world has
[52:49] devised and it says the future is here.
[52:52] Something like that. And I don't know if
[52:54] you got it, but wow. By the time I was
[52:58] done reading the things that already
[53:00] people have, they've developed it. It
[53:02] was I believe in Korea and they've
[53:05] developed stuff and and uh I can't even
[53:08] catch up now
[53:10] &gt;&gt; and I don't know if I even want to be in
[53:12] that world.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; It's just too too far advanced. I I
[53:18] mean, well, people want to communicate
[53:20] and and uh I I don't want to communicate
[53:23] that that much. says, "Tell I'll tell
[53:26] you what I think or I'll show you and
[53:28] communicate and I don't even want to to
[53:31] know everything that's in my mind, let
[53:33] alone what's in everybody else's mind."
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Don't you feel that way?
[53:41] &gt;&gt; I thought of uh I thought of us. Now
[53:43] this is just just uh digressing for a
[53:46] moment but I thought of patriotism
[53:48] you know to be patriotic and uh
[53:53] our countries
[53:55] uh you know we that's something I talked
[53:58] to the people in a convention I believe
[54:00] down in Louisiana and uh about being
[54:04] patriotic and America is very very
[54:06] patriotic and the flag and stars and
[54:10] stripes and uh Our flag is not that old.
[54:14] Our flag, it took us a while to get the
[54:17] Union Jack off and put a maple leaf on
[54:20] and and that happened actually in our
[54:24] present prime minister's
[54:27] father's while he was here. The Canadian
[54:31] flag came into existence. So, it's not
[54:33] that long ago, maybe 50 years ago.
[54:36] uh flag
[54:40] patriotism.
[54:42] Uh Webster says about patriotism.
[54:45] Webster says that being patriotic is a
[54:48] love or devotion
[54:51] to your homeland.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Well, my homeland
[54:56] happens to be unseen.
[55:02] And I'd make a big mistake by becoming
[55:04] too connected
[55:06] to anything that's visible.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I would want to take
[55:11] ownership of Hollywood,
[55:14] &gt;&gt; of the perverted state of the world,
[55:18] of the homelessness and the drunkenness
[55:20] and the violence and the murder and so
[55:23] on. So say, "Well, you're only seeing
[55:25] the bad part of it." Well, let's see the
[55:27] good part of it.
[55:29] The good part of it is the gospel
[55:33] &gt;&gt; is being preached.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Lives are being changed.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Creatures are being transformed
[55:42] &gt;&gt; from earthly
[55:44] &gt;&gt; mortals to immortal beings. That's the
[55:47] gospel of Jesus Christ and that's the
[55:50] good thing that's happening. Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; And I think that we ought to have our
[55:56] patriotism
[55:58] changed.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; I really do. Expressing devotion and
[56:03] vigorous support for one's country.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; I do not think that simply coming to
[56:10] church is vigorous support
[56:15] &gt;&gt; to our homeland. Amen.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; I believe that vigorous support
[56:19] &gt;&gt; is somebody who is living with a fervor
[56:23] and a zeal
[56:25] &gt;&gt; day by day.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Every day. Your neighbor knows it.
[56:29] Whether you're a mystic or whether
[56:31] you're sideways or whether you're insane
[56:34] or whatever they want to think or say
[56:36] about you, but just let your life
[56:38] register.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't have a chance to say it,
[56:42] but just let your life register. Oh
[56:44] yeah. Well, they are, you know, they
[56:46] are, we don't have much to do with them.
[56:48] That's perfectly fine.
[56:50] In a human lifetime,
[56:53] this lifetime that you and I are living
[56:55] in, it is filled and we are acquainted
[56:59] with beginnings and endings.
[57:04] Life begins at birth
[57:07] and ends at death.
[57:10] We begin school
[57:13] &gt;&gt; and we graduate.
[57:15] We begin married life
[57:18] till death do us part.
[57:21] We begin raising a family and end up
[57:26] empty nesters.
[57:28] We begin a job or a profession
[57:32] and we move on and advance and then end
[57:36] up in retirement.
[57:38] We may become sick
[57:41] and I trust that the sickness ends in
[57:43] health
[57:45] &gt;&gt; and we become healthy.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; And so we are filled with
[57:51] our minds are consumed with beginnings
[57:53] and endings.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; But I am acquainting you or
[57:58] reacquainting you or emphasizing
[58:02] our homeland had no beginning.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Our constitution had no beginning.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; God held us in his mind
[58:13] &gt;&gt; and we belong to another country.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; We are residents here, but we're
[58:17] citizens of the kingdom of God.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; And we should never forget that.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; We are citizens of the kingdom of God.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what language we speak,
[58:29] regardless of what color we are, we're
[58:31] citizens of the kingdom of God. We may
[58:34] have come from Congo or Nigeria or from
[58:37] Canada or America or South America or El
[58:40] Salvador or wherever more. It has
[58:42] nothing to do with that. We're citizens
[58:45] of the kingdom of God. Can this
[58:48] congregation say amen and a hearty amen?
[58:51] We're citizens of the kingdom of God.
[58:54] Residents of a country of Canada or
[58:56] United States or wherever. That's
[58:58] irrelevant.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; We're It's irrelevant. Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; And we need to become really we need to
[59:06] live that when we go out these doors.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Don't refer to me as a Canadian.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; I'm a resident of Canada,
[59:26] but my citizenship is in another
[59:29] country. Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; In a place where you won't need a
[59:35] visible passport.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to God.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 5:9 says, "Whom resist steadfast
[59:49] in the faith, knowing that the same
[59:52] afflictions are accomplished in your
[59:54] brethren that are in the world." I
[59:56] thought I would just throw that in. all
[59:58] the things that hit you when you walk
[1:00:01] out of this building. I'm not so
[1:00:02] concerned about while you're here. I
[1:00:05] know while you're here, what it is
[1:00:07] you're going to hear and you're going to
[1:00:09] sing and your mind is going to be on
[1:00:11] eternal things. But when we go out here
[1:00:14] and we we get all taken up with our job,
[1:00:17] remember your job and your education and
[1:00:21] everything that you do has a beginning
[1:00:23] and an ending. But you are eternal.
[1:00:25] Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Now, it might be hard to confess that,
[1:00:30] but you need to confess that I am an
[1:00:34] eternal being.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; I came from God and I go back to God.
[1:00:39] That doesn't have to be a nice phrase.
[1:00:41] That must not be a nice phrase. It must
[1:00:44] be something that's a reality to you.
[1:00:48] I'm not of this world. I'm not going to
[1:00:51] lay on a slab in some uh funeral parlor
[1:00:54] and and just be an average person and
[1:00:57] live like a dog or was born and die and
[1:01:01] simply go to the earth. Not so
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; the clouds of dirt that the dirt they
[1:01:07] may put upon a person's face are not
[1:01:09] going to hold a son of God. Do you think
[1:01:12] God otherwise we haven't even got a
[1:01:15] picture of God? GOD'S ETERNAL BEING.
[1:01:19] Prophet says FILLS ALL TIME AND SPACE.
[1:01:22] FILLS THE SPACE BETWEEN YOU and me
[1:01:24] today.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; God fills it. Healing fills it. Mercy
[1:01:28] fills it. Forgiveness fills it. AND WHAT
[1:01:31] JESUS BOUGHT WITH HIS OWN BLOOD, THE
[1:01:33] VERY LIFE OF CHRIST FILLS THE SPACE. THE
[1:01:37] ATTRIBUTES of God are in THIS BUILDING.
[1:01:40] THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID HE COULDN'T
[1:01:42] HEAL YOU. IF HE WAS HERE WITH THIS SUIT
[1:01:44] ON, HE CAN'T HEAL YOU. HE'S ALREADY done
[1:01:46] it.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:51] You see,
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; when Jesus was conceived,
[1:01:57] that was different.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; That was different.
[1:02:03] There was a young young lady
[1:02:06] maybe in her mid- teens by the name of
[1:02:09] Mary.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; And now she's visited by an angel.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Says, "You you're going to conceive in
[1:02:16] your womb.
[1:02:18] And you're going to bring forth, you're
[1:02:21] going to be overshadowed by the Holy
[1:02:23] Spirit and you're going to bring forth
[1:02:28] without know. And she said, "Well, how
[1:02:30] will this happen without me knowing a
[1:02:32] man?"
[1:02:33] He said, "Uh, the spirit of the highest
[1:02:36] will overshadow thee.
[1:02:40] And and you'll bring forth a son.
[1:02:43] His name will be Jesus.
[1:02:46] and he'll save his people from their
[1:02:48] sins.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:02:51] did that happen?
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that happened?
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Eternity
[1:02:57] intercepted time.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; To change things forever.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Eternity,
[1:03:04] an eternal an eternal being.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. An eternal being.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; God himself preparing a body.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; That'll be a body. And the prophet of
[1:03:15] God says finally a masterpiece, the
[1:03:18] final masterpiece was on earth and was
[1:03:21] so much like the sculptor that the
[1:03:24] sculptor stepped into the masterpiece.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Did that happen?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Then I say eternity came to earth.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; That was a different happening.
[1:03:41] Now events on earth began to unfold with
[1:03:45] a with a merging of eternity in time
[1:03:50] and things begin to happen. And they
[1:03:53] thought they were having a normal
[1:03:54] crucifixion of a man. It was eternity in
[1:03:58] time. They didn't realize that the sins,
[1:04:02] their sins were being paid for by him on
[1:04:06] the cross
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS GOD IN A BODY. AMEN.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; ETERNITY WAS unfolding
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; and they DIDN'T REALIZE IT, BUT ETERNITY
[1:04:19] WAS MERGING. TIME WAS BEING SWALLOWED UP
[1:04:23] BY ETERNITY.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; And you think this is just another
[1:04:30] movement or just another church group.
[1:04:33] the the the believers the the ranks of
[1:04:35] the believers are eternity
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; TAKING PLACE IN TIME.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And friends, we are living where WE'RE
[1:04:45] GOING TO BE. AND THIS GOD, OUR FATHER,
[1:04:49] MY FATHER, your father, he who HAD THIS
[1:04:52] MYSTERY IN HIS MIND, THIS IS HOW IT'S
[1:04:54] HAPPENING.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING TO PURGE THE EARTH.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO SAY, "FEAR NOT, CHILDREN.
[1:05:00] I'LL MAKE it worthy for you to live on.
[1:05:03] FEAR NOT, CHILDREN. I'LL CLEAN IT UP.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; FEAR NOT, CHILDREN. THIS VIOLENCE WILL
[1:05:09] DISAPPEAR. THIS HATRED will disappear.
[1:05:13] THIS BIGOTRY WILL DISAPPEAR. THIS
[1:05:15] PERVERSION WILL BE GONE. I'LL CLEAN IT
[1:05:19] AND this unbelief will be be
[1:05:21] annihilated.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:27] ETERNITY IS SWALLOWING up time
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; and you're a part of it.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PART AND PARCEL OF ETERNITY.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; If you're not,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; if you're not, if you don't believe it,
[1:05:45] you live like a man, born like a man,
[1:05:48] die like a man, and go to a man's grave.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; That's not what I want.
[1:05:58] We could describe each one of these
[1:06:00] phases of life as part of time,
[1:06:05] also part of eternity
[1:06:07] that had no beginning.
[1:06:10] There's an aspect of the believer's life
[1:06:12] that undergoes
[1:06:15] an aspect of a believer's life
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; that undergoes supernatural experience
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; that supersedes
[1:06:24] and transcends
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; all human understanding. Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Something has to happen TO YOU AND IS
[1:06:33] happening to you that you cannot explain
[1:06:36] and you CANNOT GRASP AND YOU CANNOT TELL
[1:06:40] ANYBODY ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT TRANSCENDS
[1:06:42] YOUR LANGUAGE.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Does it not?
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; If not, I'll ask to the wise man or the
[1:06:54] wise woman. Explain life. Tell me what
[1:06:57] are we doing here? What's this all
[1:06:59] about?
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; You can't even understand it. That's why
[1:07:02] people go and get drugged up and alcohol
[1:07:04] and all the rest of it. Entertain and
[1:07:06] sports and whatever more. Fill their
[1:07:08] life with something. And Satan with this
[1:07:10] shiny kingdom is just keeping shiny
[1:07:13] things in front of them to keep people
[1:07:15] occupied. Oh yeah. Yeah. And finally
[1:07:16] they keel over and they're all done.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; And the and the neighbors think, "Oh,
[1:07:21] that's what life's all about." And we we
[1:07:23] hope that somebody will stand behind the
[1:07:25] podium and tell what nice people they
[1:07:26] were. and and speak them right into
[1:07:29] heaven. Nonsense.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing. WHEN A MAN
[1:07:34] BECOMES A NEW CREATURE IN CHRIST JESUS
[1:07:36] AND A WOMAN ARE A new creature.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; AND APOSTLE PAUL SAYS, "OLD THINGS HAVE
[1:07:41] PASSED away and behold, all things are
[1:07:45] new."
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to give me a little
[1:07:53] time this morning.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; And it's a lot longwinded. Just
[1:07:57] remember, we're eternal.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was born,
[1:08:08] eternity was introduced into time.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; In a different way,
[1:08:15] the arrival of the masterpiece, the
[1:08:17] arrival of the sacrifice,
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; the perfect image of the invisible God,
[1:08:22] the cornerstone.
[1:08:24] He spoke of these two realms as existing
[1:08:28] at the same time during his time here on
[1:08:31] earth.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And I've been reading in John's gospel.
[1:08:36] And I'll come to it a little later on,
[1:08:38] Lord willing. John, the Apostle John was
[1:08:43] quite different from Matthew, Mark, and
[1:08:45] Luke.
[1:08:48] But John 3:13 said, "And no man hath
[1:08:51] ascended up to heaven, but he that came
[1:08:54] down from heaven, even the son of man
[1:08:58] which is in heaven."
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; And he never explained it.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; In fact, as Jesus said, a lot of things
[1:09:09] in the Gospel of John that you can't
[1:09:11] really explain.
[1:09:18] In Revelation 3:14,
[1:09:22] the Bible says, "And unto the angel of
[1:09:24] the church of the Leodysians," right?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And so this is we know that was brother
[1:09:31] Brandham that was was the angel of the
[1:09:34] church
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; or the messenger of this time.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And he said and and God sent to him a
[1:09:40] message and said, "Write these things
[1:09:43] the amen." Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; The faithful and true witness, the
[1:09:50] beginning of the creation of God.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was that beginning.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; I'm glad there was another beginning.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; I'm glad it's not just Genesis 1:1. In
[1:10:01] the beginning,
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; this was our beginning.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; In the beginning,
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; the beginning of the new creation of
[1:10:08] God.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; I'M GLAD THE SACRIFICE WAS THE
[1:10:11] BEGINNING. Your sacrifice, friends.
[1:10:14] was the beginning. Without that, you do
[1:10:17] not have a new creature in Christ Jesus.
[1:10:19] You have no possibility of being a new
[1:10:21] creature. But because there was a
[1:10:23] beginning,
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT SUBJECT. THIS BODY MAY be the
[1:10:28] product of Adam and Eve's
[1:10:31] uh failure back there and it fails.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; You do all you want. You eat all the
[1:10:39] organic food you want. And I believe
[1:10:42] that a person should do the best that
[1:10:45] they can. You swallow all the pills you
[1:10:48] want. You have all the vitamins that you
[1:10:51] want. You'll still get older.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; You'll still have a year by year go by.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; I was thinking of an old friend of mine,
[1:11:04] Brother McGriff. He said his wife went
[1:11:06] into the grocery store
[1:11:09] and she was a little longer and he
[1:11:11] thought, "Well, I will I'll just go and
[1:11:13] see what she's doing." And so he said,
[1:11:15] "I was just tunching right by the dark
[1:11:18] windows and he said, I looked in the
[1:11:19] window and there was a old man kind of
[1:11:22] hunched over and he says, I stopped. It
[1:11:24] was me."
[1:11:28] So I say to my wife, "Walk straight.
[1:11:33] We want to be real erect,
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; but you know, regardless how straight
[1:11:38] you try to be, you finally slump over.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; It's it's called time. It's called these
[1:11:43] old bodies, whatever you want to call
[1:11:46] it. But I say there's a land
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; beyond the river that's not affected by
[1:11:52] time.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You believe that, don't
[1:11:56] you?
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; And the happiness is genuine.
[1:12:04] Hallelujah.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; The beginning of the creation of God.
[1:12:11] It's a profound thought to consider that
[1:12:13] both time and timelessness of God was
[1:12:17] then embodied in one.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; That's a profound thought in one. Jesus
[1:12:23] Christ. And from the words of Jesus, we
[1:12:26] conclude that both worlds were present
[1:12:30] in him.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; It's an incredible thought
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; that a man who people found all kinds of
[1:12:41] error with
[1:12:43] actually was eternity
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; and time merged into that one body.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; What a glorious one.
[1:12:55] You want to think about that
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; eternity. How could he not say things
[1:13:00] that were JUST SO PROFOUND and so un and
[1:13:05] and so complicated for the human mind?
[1:13:07] The human mind hasn't got the capacity
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; to grasp those things. And I can I I
[1:13:15] tell you what I read I was reading in
[1:13:17] John while I was away and I read about
[1:13:19] 18 19 20 chapters and I just realized
[1:13:23] there was
[1:13:25] a whole lot of it
[1:13:27] I couldn't understand. I could
[1:13:30] understand it you know with a human
[1:13:33] understanding but couldn't understand
[1:13:35] the depths. And I would even say Lord
[1:13:38] cause me to know what you're saying.
[1:13:43] Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And thus he spoke of his father. Is this
[1:13:50] am I following along for you?
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke of his father
[1:13:55] and he spoke to the his religious
[1:13:58] leaders that he said, "I'm the God of
[1:13:59] Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God
[1:14:02] of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; but of the living."
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:10] We're referred to as creatures of time,
[1:14:12] but also creatures of eternity. I'm
[1:14:15] giving you some message quickly, some
[1:14:17] background. In the message, we would see
[1:14:20] Jesus. Brother Brandham said, "Blessed
[1:14:23] and eternal God, as we come humbly as
[1:14:27] the creatures of time into thy presence,
[1:14:30] we ask that you'll remember us, Lord,
[1:14:33] and we'll for and will forgive us of all
[1:14:36] of our sins and trespasses against you."
[1:14:40] And then in Serpent Seed, he says,
[1:14:42] "We're not creatures of time. We're
[1:14:45] creatures of eternity."
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; That is not a contradiction.
[1:14:50] That's an evolution.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; We were born creatures of time, but we
[1:14:55] have become creatures of eternity.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; One of the most important was when we
[1:15:02] were born again. And you must be born
[1:15:04] again.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; You know, the scripture that involves
[1:15:09] Nicodemus is not in Matthew, Mark, or
[1:15:13] Luke,
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; but it's in John.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Just hold that.
[1:15:20] in questions and answers. He says, "When
[1:15:22] a man is born of the spirit of God, he's
[1:15:25] a creature no longer of time, but he's a
[1:15:28] creature of eternity."
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's passed from death unto life.
[1:15:33] He's passed from the He's passed from
[1:15:35] the time element into the eternal
[1:15:38] eternity. He can never perish. God swore
[1:15:42] that he'd raise him up at the last day.
[1:15:45] And it's it it's difficult to look at a
[1:15:47] person maybe gasping their last breaths
[1:15:50] on life and and and and yet for him to
[1:15:53] be able to have that kind of faith and
[1:15:56] confidence. You say, "Well, is that just
[1:15:58] a self-will? Is it just something he was
[1:16:00] educated to say? Is this is this
[1:16:03] something he just learned from
[1:16:04] childhood? Or is it a reality?"
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; It can it must either be a reality or
[1:16:10] this book isn't true. Right.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; And it can't be something, well, I just
[1:16:15] learned it or I've quoted this all my
[1:16:17] life. It has to be something that is
[1:16:20] such a reality now that it's that that's
[1:16:22] out there that's a lie.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; That out there isn't true.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; All of this other is just all it is is
[1:16:34] side issues to help me through life.
[1:16:49] I'm just thinking over whether I should
[1:16:51] say it or not. Do you want me to say it?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; All of your difficulties
[1:16:57] is a Satan's facade. Right.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it's health issues,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; financial issues,
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; whatever kind of issues there are.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; They're only it's only a facade.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Another word for that is a fake.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Another word for that might be a bluff.
[1:17:27] Satan's bluffing the people.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, the kind of problems
[1:17:33] that you have, the scripture has says
[1:17:37] that our brethren in the world are
[1:17:39] afflicted by the same things.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Only they use different things to
[1:17:44] overcome it and forget it. And it might
[1:17:47] be, you know, some uh social work or
[1:17:51] social club or or or some people are
[1:17:55] trying to drown out the reality of life.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; The very world that the devil gave them
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; and they have find or have followed
[1:18:06] shiny things. Listen friends, don't
[1:18:09] follow shiny things.
[1:18:12] They will lose their shine
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; and the real world will finally sink in
[1:18:18] someday
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; and we don't want it.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; The devil can have it back.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; He can have all that he's designed back.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; He can have all the Hollywood he wants,
[1:18:32] all the entertainment he wants. Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you think that maybe we're
[1:18:49] just up here preaching,
[1:18:52] but I I want to say to you in all
[1:18:54] sincerity,
[1:18:56] you wouldn't want my burdens.
[1:19:02] You wouldn't want my burdens.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Even in the last few days, you wouldn't
[1:19:08] want my burdens.
[1:19:10] Say, well, you know, are you just that
[1:19:12] strong? No, no, no. We're not strong.
[1:19:14] We're we're weak. We're just children,
[1:19:19] but we have a God.
[1:19:21] And of my confidence wasn't in that God.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; And he has come through in the last few
[1:19:28] days.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; He's come through and showed I'm your
[1:19:31] father.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm saying it to you.
[1:19:35] I'm not saying it to you as a preacher.
[1:19:36] I'm saying it to your brother.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; We have a God.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; He's your God.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; And my God. He's your father.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Your father.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; A kind father. a caring father. And you
[1:19:51] must believe that
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; and YOU MUST CONFESS THAT.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; MY GOD,
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; my God.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, brother Daniel?
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; He's our God.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; And he's present.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; He's eternal.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; You can't dispense with him. He's here.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; He's more real than the one sitting next
[1:20:15] to you. The one sitting next to you, the
[1:20:17] body THERE MAY PASS AWAY, BUT HE WILL
[1:20:20] NEVER PASS AWAY. And that's WHY JESUS
[1:20:23] SAID, "I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU."
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; I will never forsake you.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Others may, but he will not.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:20:42] So when man is born of the spirit, he
[1:20:44] becomes a creature no longer of time but
[1:20:47] of eternity.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; In him was life.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; John 1 and4
[1:20:56] and the life was the light of men
[1:20:59] both mortal and immortal.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Both mortal and immortal life were
[1:21:04] revealed in the being of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:08] Hallelujah.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; God in Jesus Christ took upon himself
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; both physical life
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; that could die a man's death
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; and also immortal life that was beyond
[1:21:20] the reach of death.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; He's the one.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. You call him your
[1:21:27] Lord and Master. He said if I be your
[1:21:29] Lord and Master
[1:21:31] you'll do the things that I say. He's
[1:21:33] the one who had to say that he was
[1:21:36] virgin born.
[1:21:37] He couldn't prove he was virgin born.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; You can prove that you have a certain
[1:21:43] mother and a certain father. He could
[1:21:45] not prove that Joseph was his father
[1:21:47] because he was not his father.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; And so that very fact gave him a bad
[1:21:53] name.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; And he bore that bad name so that he
[1:21:58] could tell YOU THAT MY FATHER'S your
[1:22:01] father.
[1:22:05] ISN'T THAT WORTH REJOICING ABOUT?
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; He bore that illicit birth
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; name so that you could be genuinely born
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; of God
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; in Abraham's grace covenant.
[1:22:25] and a man or a woman that can lean upon
[1:22:28] God's bosom. He said that's my father
[1:22:32] who's created heavens and earth. He made
[1:22:35] me. This is something you're you say.
[1:22:38] This is he's saying it that you'll say
[1:22:40] this. He's my father.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; He made me.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; He made me a new creature.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And after he made that was after he made
[1:22:51] me a creature of time. You made ME A
[1:22:54] CREATURE OF TIME, BUT YOU MADE ME A NEW
[1:22:56] CREATURE.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; You're my father.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; In a way, it's bypassing
[1:23:07] your human father.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "I have a human father."
[1:23:14] That's my dad.
[1:23:17] Listen, folks. Your dad didn't even know
[1:23:20] you
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; when you were a little sperm.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't have a clue what you were
[1:23:26] going to look like.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; But your father that I'm talking about,
[1:23:34] he knew who you were. He knew what you
[1:23:37] were going to look like.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; He knew why you were coming here. He
[1:23:42] knew that he would intercept you in time
[1:23:45] with eternity. AND BECAUSE YOU'RE an
[1:23:48] eternal being, you'd get more than
[1:23:50] excited, you'd believe it.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'D EVEN SAY, "I DON'T KNOW WHY I
[1:23:55] BELIEVE IT, BUT I BELIEVE THAT."
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Maybe earthly FATHER DOESN'T BELIEVE IT,
[1:24:00] BUT I BELIEVE IT.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:16] That's why sometimes earthly friends
[1:24:18] say, "I can't go there. I can't go with
[1:24:20] you." Say of war,
[1:24:24] I'm on my way.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; That's where Rebecca was called up. I
[1:24:31] didn't know where it was going to fit
[1:24:32] and I had it down, but I just put it at
[1:24:35] the bottom of this message. Rebecca was
[1:24:37] asked finally her her parents
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; in this life in time said uh will you go
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; and and and Eleazar is there and the
[1:24:49] camels are there and everything's there
[1:24:52] and Isaac is only a something that's
[1:24:55] touched her ear
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; there's Isaac
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; I'm here my my father my my lord he has
[1:25:04] given all of his substance to his son.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; She has only heard about him.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Says, "Will you go?"
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Just three words. I will go.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; I will go.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; I hope I have time
[1:25:28] in the message experiences.
[1:25:33] Brother Brandham is describing in a and
[1:25:35] describing the appearance of the angel
[1:25:39] and the light
[1:25:41] and and he said it's the first time he
[1:25:43] saw him that way and he described his
[1:25:46] face and the size of him about 200 lb.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And he says and the angel is telling him
[1:25:55] you'll you'll take a message of healing
[1:25:58] to the people.
[1:26:01] And he says, "I'm not educated and they
[1:26:03] won't believe me."
[1:26:05] And the angel says, "I'll be with you."
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says those three
[1:26:11] words, "I will go."
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; he went.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; somebody could go
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; that could speak of things from an
[1:26:27] unseen world?
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; And now I want to bring you. Now, I need
[1:26:30] your full attention just for a moment
[1:26:32] because I'm jumping way, way ahead in my
[1:26:34] message. I'm so thankful
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; that you and I are following a message
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; where a messenger spent so much time
[1:26:43] peering into another world.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; What world was that?
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; It was eternity
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; and then he speaks FROM WHAT HE SEES AND
[1:26:52] WHAT HE SEES is an eternal happening.
[1:26:56] This is what's going to happen. this is
[1:26:59] what happened to you and you fell and
[1:27:01] and he talked about a man in a hay rack.
[1:27:04] You fell on a hay rack and and HE GOES
[1:27:06] INTO SUCH DETAILS. THIS IS HOW DOES HE
[1:27:09] KNOW THAT IT'S COMING FROM ETERNITY?
[1:27:13] ETERNITY IS IN INTERSECTING TIME and we
[1:27:17] read it and we think oh this is just in
[1:27:19] a book this is just on a disc. DON'T YOU
[1:27:22] EVER think that
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; GOD IS INTERCEPTING YOUR LIFE,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; giving you human eyes and a brain of
[1:27:30] UNDERSTANDING TO SAY THAT came from God,
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; THAT CAME FROM ETERNITY. And now he had
[1:27:38] a vessel here on earth that would be
[1:27:41] simple enough and humble enough to say
[1:27:44] what he saw.
[1:27:46] AND THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS REACHING INTO
[1:27:48] AN ETERNAL REALM. And eternity was being
[1:27:52] unfolded
[1:27:54] in time.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; For eternal beings to believe it.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; And some say I believe it.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Some say I don't believe it. Some said I
[1:28:08] believe it's a hoax.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Some said I believe it's of the devil.
[1:28:14] And brother Brandham even said to people
[1:28:15] standing right in front of him,
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; sure,
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; it depends what you think it is.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; If you think this comes from Satan,
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; that's where your reward will come from.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; If you think it comes from God,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; that's where your reward will come from.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Depends what you think this message is.
[1:28:41] Yes.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; What this message that I'm preaching is
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; this is not my opinion.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; This is not some man's thought.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; This is something that's divine from God
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; that it's energized by the Holy Ghost
[1:28:57] and comes from the word of God.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And if you believe that,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; you are eternal beings.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; God is my father.
[1:29:09] Jesus teach us to pray. Our father
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; whose father his father and my father
[1:29:16] JESUS FATHER AND MY FATHER I father my
[1:29:19] father which art in heaven and and the
[1:29:22] prophet comes as this heaven is just a
[1:29:24] breath away. IT'S JUST A STEP AWAY. It's
[1:29:28] right here present with us. You're
[1:29:30] living in it. You're living in time, but
[1:29:33] you're an eternal being unfolding. And
[1:29:37] eternity is unfolding. The events and
[1:29:39] the mystery of God is unfolding within
[1:29:42] the body, bride body of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, to me it looks like a looks
[1:29:49] like it's just another church." That's
[1:29:51] right. That's in the temporal scene.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; But of a to a person who's an eternal
[1:29:58] being, it looks very very different. Oh,
[1:30:01] we sing the same courses. And we sing
[1:30:03] the same songs. Catholics do it.
[1:30:06] Orthodox do it. OTHER PEOPLE DO IT. I
[1:30:09] DON'T CARE WHO DOES IT.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; It has a different meaning
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; for a believer. Does it have a different
[1:30:18] meaning for you?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:38] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[1:30:40] is a new creature.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away, and behold,
[1:30:44] all things are become new.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Are they only new when a person's in the
[1:30:50] sanctuary,
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; or are they new when we go out? Are they
[1:30:54] new when everything has gone sideways?
[1:30:57] Are they new when sickness befalls us?
[1:31:00] Are they new? What is it that is new? I
[1:31:03] can tell you friends, those things of
[1:31:05] this world, Satan is not greater than
[1:31:08] our God. Our God is greater than these
[1:31:11] things.
[1:31:23] You have no one
[1:31:26] amongst this earthly clan that could
[1:31:28] say, "For I will be merciful to their
[1:31:31] unrighteousness,
[1:31:33] and their sins and their iniquities will
[1:31:35] I remember no more."
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. and their sins and
[1:31:40] their iniquities will I remember no
[1:31:43] more.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; That which is born of the flesh is
[1:31:46] flesh.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And that which is born of the spirit is
[1:31:50] spirit.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; It is a holy spirit.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; That which is born of the spirit is
[1:31:58] spirit.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Born of the spirit of God.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Is it so? Is it so in your life? Is it
[1:32:06] so? Is a reality. Say, God, let this
[1:32:09] message ring not only true in my ears,
[1:32:12] but let it be true in my soul.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Can I tell some of the events of the
[1:32:20] last few days?
[1:32:26] Joanne has not been here at the Oregon
[1:32:30] and much sicker than you may know.
[1:32:37] And we were away on vacation
[1:32:40] and I became very very very troubled
[1:32:43] and very very burdened
[1:32:46] and we came back one week early.
[1:32:49] I changed the flights. Yes. It cost
[1:32:52] something. You know at a time like that
[1:32:54] nothing means anything.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; That's all the system. Well, you can't
[1:32:59] change the you can't change your
[1:33:01] tickets. Well, there has to be a way.
[1:33:04] There's had to be a way.
[1:33:06] you. Okay. All right. Well, it's going
[1:33:09] to cost you whatever it is. Whatever it
[1:33:10] is, just just do do your thing. And
[1:33:14] that's recognizing people are in in this
[1:33:17] world,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; but you're from another world.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; So, well, it's going to cost you
[1:33:21] something. Well, God will have to
[1:33:22] provide it.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God. I'm in another
[1:33:26] kingdom.
[1:33:28] Amen.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; So, we came back
[1:33:33] and went over and saw Tom and Joanne
[1:33:38] and uh Joanna is not well
[1:33:42] and she's gasping for her breath.
[1:33:47] And said, "Well, her lungs are clear.
[1:33:50] There's no pneumonia." That's what one
[1:33:52] doctor said, but another hospital said,
[1:33:54] "Well, there was some."
[1:33:56] Anyway,
[1:33:58] that has nothing to do with me. That's
[1:34:01] their diagnosis and that's fine. I
[1:34:04] respect them and the prophet held the
[1:34:07] doctors in high esteem
[1:34:11] and uh that was day one evening.
[1:34:17] Next morning I went back.
[1:34:20] Sister Joanne had a doctor
[1:34:23] some years ago
[1:34:25] over a period of three four years.
[1:34:30] I won't use her name but she's very very
[1:34:33] very
[1:34:35] highly highly qualified
[1:34:39] uh specialist.
[1:34:41] If you were to get to see her, it would
[1:34:45] maybe take you 9 months.
[1:34:49] You'd be well to see her within a year.
[1:34:53] A very very busy person
[1:35:02] and I am
[1:35:04] sometime we think oh the Holy Spirit is
[1:35:06] just so wonderful. I'm just happy and
[1:35:08] jigging and dancing. No sometime you're
[1:35:10] very very troubled
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; and it's the spirit of God. Even when
[1:35:16] Mary was told, "You're going to have a
[1:35:18] child. You're going to have a you're
[1:35:20] going to conceive,"
[1:35:23] she was troubled. How how how is that
[1:35:25] going to happen? Me not knowing a man.
[1:35:29] The spirit of the Almighty will
[1:35:31] overshadow you and there will be a
[1:35:34] performance of those things
[1:35:37] because thou hast believed.
[1:35:40] Let it be unto me according to your
[1:35:42] word.
[1:35:44] She can't even she can't even convince
[1:35:46] anybody she met an angel.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; That's how vague that's how abstract
[1:35:53] that world becomes. I'm here to tell you
[1:35:57] that's a real world.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; It's more real than the seat you're
[1:36:01] sitting on.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; It's more real than the breath you're
[1:36:05] breathing.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; It's a reality.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; This is not church. Right.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; We're here to meet the living God.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to testify he is a living
[1:36:16] God.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; And I looked into Joannne's eyes and I
[1:36:25] said, "You need somebody that knows you,
[1:36:28] knows your body."
[1:36:30] And I named this doctor from some time
[1:36:32] ago.
[1:36:34] She knows you. She understands you.
[1:36:41] And then before we left, we had prayer
[1:36:43] together. Got down and prayed.
[1:36:48] And uh I didn't remember what we prayed.
[1:36:52] Brother Tom and Joanne together reminded
[1:36:55] me
[1:36:57] and I said uh
[1:37:03] in prayer, have Dr. Stalter was a name.
[1:37:08] have her call Joanne tonight.
[1:37:12] To me, that would have been such an
[1:37:13] absurd statement. I wouldn't have never
[1:37:16] prayed anything like that. But they both
[1:37:19] said after I was done and had left,
[1:37:22] said, "How is Dr. Star going to call me
[1:37:25] tonight?"
[1:37:28] "Tonight?"
[1:37:31] And I left there.
[1:37:37] My wife who's sitting here
[1:37:40] said she didn't know what was happening.
[1:37:43] Said, "You stepped into the car
[1:37:47] took your iPhone.
[1:37:49] I punched in an address
[1:37:53] and drove to another city
[1:37:57] in a New Westminster."
[1:38:00] And when I parked the car, I said to my
[1:38:03] wife, "Sit here. I'm going to run." And
[1:38:06] I ran out because it was coming right on
[1:38:08] to 4:00. Offices closed at 4:00.
[1:38:13] And I ran across two streets into this
[1:38:17] office building upstairs to the fourth
[1:38:19] floor, went to the door, opened it up.
[1:38:23] There was a young lady and I prayed on
[1:38:25] the way. I said if I'm not to see her,
[1:38:29] if you have some other way that you
[1:38:31] would get your glory,
[1:38:35] if you have some other way,
[1:38:38] you get the glory, I will be careful to
[1:38:41] see that you get all the glory.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; No one can do anything but God himself.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; And this will be God and God alone.
[1:38:52] And if you see fit that I should not see
[1:38:56] her,
[1:38:57] just say arrange that she's not in. I
[1:39:00] walked up. I said, "Excuse me.
[1:39:03] I'm Mr. Biscll. I'm Joanne Ray's father.
[1:39:07] I need to see Dr. Staller just for two
[1:39:10] minutes." She said, "She's not in." Like
[1:39:15] that was the end of the subject. I said,
[1:39:16] "Well, thank you."
[1:39:19] I said, "Please,
[1:39:21] could you have Dr. Staller
[1:39:24] give Joanna a call?" So, she's typing it
[1:39:27] in her machine. Okay.
[1:39:30] That was over.
[1:39:32] And I went out and I went to into the
[1:39:35] foyer, into the lobby, and I punched the
[1:39:39] elevator button, but there was something
[1:39:42] still wasn't satisfied inside. I left.
[1:39:44] So I went back in
[1:39:47] and I said, "Excuse me." I leaned over
[1:39:50] and looked right into her eyes,
[1:39:52] said, "Would you please do me a personal
[1:39:55] favor?
[1:39:57] Would you please contact the doctor,
[1:40:01] Dr. Stler, and have her call Joanne?"
[1:40:06] And so she's still typing, "All right."
[1:40:09] and I walked out
[1:40:12] to the natural in this world, you'd say
[1:40:15] very unfriendly.
[1:40:18] All I knew, I was being guided by the
[1:40:23] Holy Spirit.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; And when I walked out, I got in a car
[1:40:28] and drove home. We came to church this
[1:40:32] Wednesday night.
[1:40:35] Soon as we got home,
[1:40:37] the phone rang.
[1:40:40] Joanne never answers the phone. She's
[1:40:44] too weak.
[1:40:46] Just that weak. Never answers the phone.
[1:40:49] Has no voice.
[1:40:52] And she was on the phone struggling.
[1:41:01] Dad,
[1:41:03] did you call Dr. Stler?
[1:41:07] I said no. I went to her office.
[1:41:12] She said
[1:41:14] she just she just called me
[1:41:18] at 9:30. She called me and I just got
[1:41:21] off the phone with her and she wants to
[1:41:24] see me tomorrow morning at the Royal
[1:41:26] Colombian Hospital
[1:41:29] and she could hear my voice.
[1:41:32] She wasn't that troubled from the voice,
[1:41:34] but she wants to see me.
[1:41:36] And then what would we say, Tom? 10
[1:41:39] hours.
[1:41:43] In 10 hours,
[1:41:46] we had a new
[1:41:48] girl,
[1:41:51] Tom, a new wife,
[1:41:55] and Sister Biscll, and I a new daughter
[1:41:59] because the thing turned right around.
[1:42:01] And I had told God,
[1:42:03] if that doesn't happen, I will cancel
[1:42:06] out of Switzerland,
[1:42:09] even though I had been receiving a
[1:42:10] message, this message
[1:42:13] in a different way completely for
[1:42:15] Switzerland.
[1:42:16] And my wife says, "Well, I know you are
[1:42:18] going to Switzerland. God has given you
[1:42:21] a message for Switzerland."
[1:42:23] I said, "Only if this happens, this must
[1:42:27] turn around.
[1:42:28] There must be a complete turnaround.
[1:42:31] Joanna is listening to this. She sent me
[1:42:34] a text just before. She said, "I won't
[1:42:36] be near you physically, but I will be
[1:42:39] near you
[1:42:41] in spirit.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; I'll be listening." And so she's
[1:42:45] listening to what I'm saying. This is
[1:42:47] the absolute truth. She came home
[1:42:49] yesterday,
[1:42:52] was released from hospital yesterday,
[1:42:54] said, "Just go home now and rest." You
[1:42:57] may think that that wasn't that serious.
[1:42:59] I'll tell you what, God stepped down
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; to do eternity stepped down.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm preaching about.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Had eternity not stepped down,
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; I probably wouldn't be here preaching
[1:43:15] this morning. I experienced while I was
[1:43:18] studying this. I could see eternity,
[1:43:21] eternal things INTERCEPT TIME AND
[1:43:25] CREATURES of time AND DICTATE TO THEM
[1:43:28] WHAT they shall do. AND WE OBEY THE
[1:43:31] SPIRIT. THERE WAS NO INSTRUCTOR TO say
[1:43:34] that. There was no PHYSICIAN TO SAY
[1:43:36] THAT. GOD THE GREAT PHYSICIAN.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; The healer is here.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; THE KING IS HERE.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; CHRIST IS HERE.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; To do whatever you have need of. And you
[1:43:51] think THINGS COULD GO SIDEWAYS. THEY MAY
[1:43:53] GO SIDEWAYS. BUT GOD IS IN CONTROL.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Our father is in control.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Our job is to listen to that voice, to
[1:44:03] heed that voice and say, "I will go.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; I will go. I will do it.
[1:44:11] I WILL SAY WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; I WILL ASK REPENTANCE WHEN YOU WANT me
[1:44:16] to say.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; What shall we do? They said to Peter,
[1:44:20] men and brethren, what shall we do? They
[1:44:22] were pricricked in their hearts. That's
[1:44:24] what needs to happen. Maybe even some
[1:44:27] here need to be pricricked in THEIR
[1:44:28] HEART. AND ONCE YOU'RE PRICRICKED IN
[1:44:30] YOUR HEART, YOU SAY, "LORD GOD, WHAT
[1:44:33] SHALL I DO?"
[1:44:35] SAY, REPENT
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; AND BE BAPTIZED every one of you in the
[1:44:41] name of Jesus Christ
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; and you shall be saved.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; I see. Brother Joe Waldner,
[1:44:52] is David away?
[1:44:56] Good.
[1:44:58] You're here.
[1:45:02] I got a phone call yesterday
[1:45:06] and a pastor in the church
[1:45:10] about 4,000 miles from here
[1:45:13] stood up in his congregation
[1:45:18] in the morning service
[1:45:20] and he said, "Tonight
[1:45:23] we are having the Lord's table and
[1:45:26] footwash and communion
[1:45:29] and I want you to be here and I have a
[1:45:32] surprise for you.
[1:45:35] So the people gathered for Lord's table,
[1:45:38] footwash and communion.
[1:45:41] Did you listen to it, Tim?
[1:45:44] I saw you nodding, so I guess that's
[1:45:46] right.
[1:45:49] You know about this, Brother Tom?
[1:45:53] and he puts on the screen
[1:45:56] brother David Waldner
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; giving his testimony from the other day
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; and running all over this church and
[1:46:05] that pastor was so moved he said listen
[1:46:08] FOLKS
[1:46:09] CLOVERDALE IS HAVING A REVIVAL
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; and it's been GOING ON FOR ABOUT FOUR
[1:46:15] YEARS HE SAID AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT
[1:46:17] FOR OUR CHURCH A REVIVAL
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; I say Keep it burning, friend.
[1:46:24] Hallelujah. This God that you serve,
[1:46:26] he's not far away. He's present. AND
[1:46:29] JUST SAY TO HIM TODAY, I WILL PRAY. I
[1:46:33] will go.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; I will ask him to do more for us.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; It's eternity.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Eternal things are eternity. It's not oh
[1:46:50] when this life is over. No friends,
[1:46:53] everything the things that we as the
[1:46:55] elect of God are experiencing
[1:46:58] they are eternal things.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to take this just as a
[1:47:10] service.
[1:47:24] Can I have a few more minutes of your
[1:47:25] time?
[1:47:30] Now, this is probably one of my main
[1:47:32] points.
[1:47:35] Some things are hard for us
[1:47:38] as humans to
[1:47:41] grasp.
[1:47:43] And excuse me for taking the time but we
[1:47:46] need to take it. I just have felt Lord I
[1:47:49] am not going to dilute.
[1:47:53] I'm not going to belittle what you are
[1:47:55] doing.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you if we needed the
[1:48:00] time. We shall take the time. And
[1:48:02] tonight I am so
[1:48:05] filled with expectancy. I want to see
[1:48:08] and hear our brother Tim Dodd as he
[1:48:10] speaks about Ethiopia because to me it's
[1:48:13] not just a country in the world. That's
[1:48:14] a a name that the people have given it
[1:48:17] and so on so forth, but it's a part of
[1:48:19] the earth and there's people there that
[1:48:21] God allowed to be birthed and born here
[1:48:23] who have an ache in their heart and a
[1:48:25] desire for the truth. And if God opens a
[1:48:28] door for us to send the truth over
[1:48:30] there, I will go
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; or we will send somebody. OUR BROTHER
[1:48:35] TIM DODD SAID HE WENT GO
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; and his son went with him
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; and I would SAY GLORY TO GOD. THIS
[1:48:43] CONGREGATION TO SAY GOD BE PRAISED.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; HE HAS GIVEN US THIS OPPORTUNITY.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; HOW ELSE WILL THEY HEAR IF WE DON'T SEND
[1:48:52] SOMEBODY?
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; GOD BLESS BROTHER BUSABOSI. GOD BLESS
[1:48:56] THE WORK over there.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:00] And next Sunday or Sunday, April the
[1:49:02] 1st, we're going to have brother brother
[1:49:05] Eboli from Uganda here.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Uh it's a April the 1st, is it not?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; April 1 and Friday. There'll be no
[1:49:16] Sunday that no service that Wednesday
[1:49:20] during the week coming up to April the
[1:49:22] 1st and then we'll be brother Ibali on
[1:49:26] Friday and on Sunday.
[1:49:29] Amen. Now, we got that out of the way.
[1:49:34] But I said earlier, and I'm going to
[1:49:36] close with this, but I want you to
[1:49:38] ponder it very, very deeply.
[1:49:42] One of the hardest things
[1:49:45] for us as humans,
[1:49:50] I think one of the things that hinder us
[1:49:53] most
[1:49:57] is to acknowledge
[1:50:00] who we are.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; If I ask you who who are you, you'll
[1:50:07] say, well, I'm so and so. And is that
[1:50:10] your name? Yes. What is your birth date?
[1:50:13] They ask me my birth date all the time.
[1:50:19] Sometimes I think they don't think I can
[1:50:21] remember it or what.
[1:50:24] So I give them my birth date
[1:50:28] and we identify ourselves
[1:50:31] and we're citizens of a certain country
[1:50:32] and we live at a certain place. Listen
[1:50:34] to me folks.
[1:50:37] want your full attention now for the
[1:50:38] next 101 15 minutes and I'm done.
[1:50:44] That is this world.
[1:50:47] That is this life.
[1:50:51] We need we need desperately to become
[1:50:55] not disassociated with it but
[1:50:58] spiritually disconnected.
[1:51:01] And we need to be spiritually so
[1:51:03] connected.
[1:51:06] Other people said of Jesus, "Well, he
[1:51:08] lived in Nazareth, so he was called the
[1:51:10] Nazarene."
[1:51:12] That's fine. That's what he said.
[1:51:14] Whatever they want to say, that's fine.
[1:51:18] But as far as he was concerned, I came
[1:51:20] from God.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; You don't know me and you don't know my
[1:51:24] father.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; If you'd known what Moses said, you'd
[1:51:28] know me because he spoke of me.
[1:51:31] He was he was dealing in terms that left
[1:51:34] them absolutely astounded all the time.
[1:51:38] They couldn't figure out who do you
[1:51:40] think you are?
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; One of our greatest difficulties
[1:51:50] is to live in this world as though we
[1:51:53] don't belong. Mhm.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; We become so
[1:51:59] consumed with the fact
[1:52:02] and they have a nice phrase in the
[1:52:04] world, you become so heavenly good,
[1:52:05] you're no earthly heavenly minded,
[1:52:08] you're no earthly good. No, no, that's
[1:52:09] not right. If you come become so
[1:52:12] heavenly minded, you will be earthly
[1:52:14] good.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus, now I'm saying it. Jesus knew who
[1:52:24] he was. And so right away you say, "Oh
[1:52:26] yeah, well that's fine for Jesus." No,
[1:52:28] no, no.
[1:52:30] And Brother Brandham knew who he was.
[1:52:36] And I've always marveled. He'd come out
[1:52:38] on the platform. I've wondered if I
[1:52:40] would have enough courage for that.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Come out on the platform
[1:52:46] and say, "Now I'm just your brother.
[1:52:50] That's mortal.
[1:52:53] I'm just helpless.
[1:52:55] I'm as helpless as can be. That's
[1:52:57] mortal.
[1:52:59] And if he comes, I don't know. But if he
[1:53:03] comes,
[1:53:05] his confidence went beyond human reach.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; It transcended all sanity.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; I I knew what I said. It transcended all
[1:53:21] sanity because for a man just to put up
[1:53:24] his finger and say he's here.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, who's here?
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, someone from the unseen world is
[1:53:31] here. But it wasn't unseen to him. He
[1:53:33] knew he was here.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; And whatever he said, that's what was
[1:53:37] going to happen.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; And regardless of how absurd or how
[1:53:42] ridiculous or how far it went back in
[1:53:45] the person's life or what happened to
[1:53:47] them, I don't know if you're a
[1:53:49] Christian. I don't know what I don't
[1:53:51] know what the situation is, but he was
[1:53:53] going to speak it. WHAT IS HE SAYING? I
[1:53:56] WILL GO. I WILL SAY IT
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE. I WILL SAY IT.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Listen friends,
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; UNDER THAT INSPIRATION, HE TOLD you who
[1:54:08] you are.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT WILLIAM BRANDHAM TELLING THEM
[1:54:12] PEOPLE. IT WAS ETERNITY COMING DOWN AND
[1:54:17] GOD WHO'S OMNIPRESENT TELLING THEM this
[1:54:20] is what happened to this girl when you
[1:54:23] fell down. You're about 8 years old and
[1:54:25] you fell down a well and you loosed all
[1:54:27] your all your organs. Who said that?
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; ONLY GOD COULD SAY THAT.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; WHO could turn things around?
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Even in my own experience and I I was
[1:54:40] explain studying this subject. I was
[1:54:42] explaining to brother Tom. I said,
[1:54:43] "Listen, God knows who knows exactly
[1:54:48] maybe through the test and everything
[1:54:50] about a certain being and he'll say, uh,
[1:54:52] this certain person, you've had the
[1:54:55] training." IT WAS GOD THAT EVEN ALLOWED
[1:54:57] THEM TO GO THROUGH college and
[1:55:00] university and years and years and years
[1:55:03] of study because God in his mind saying,
[1:55:05] "Someday I'm going to lay my finger on
[1:55:08] you and you're going to make a phone
[1:55:10] call and you're going to do certain
[1:55:12] things and you're going to call certain
[1:55:14] colleagues and I'll use your influence.
[1:55:17] I put you in this place. I put you IN
[1:55:20] THIS HOSPITAL. I PUT YOU with these
[1:55:22] medical PEOPLE FOR WHAT PURPOSE?
[1:55:27] FOR ONE PURPOSE. YOU'RE GOING TO SERVE
[1:55:29] MY PURPOSE.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO SERVE AN ETERNAL
[1:55:32] PURPOSE.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Do you folks believe that?
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; I want to ask this congregation, do you
[1:55:38] believe that?
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; And God had you here in this service TO
[1:55:44] HEAR THIS MESSAGE SO THE ETERNAL SPIRIT
[1:55:48] OF GOD COULD SPEAK TO YOU WHAT HE WANTS
[1:55:50] TO SAY to you.
[1:55:54] Amen.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; One of the hardest things, and I'm
[1:56:01] having just a little bit of difficulty
[1:56:03] even now
[1:56:05] because one of the hardest things is to
[1:56:06] say
[1:56:08] I'm a son of God.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody that I admire very, very much
[1:56:13] is brother
[1:56:16] Ron Spencer's father.
[1:56:19] You don't know him well. I know him
[1:56:22] quite well.
[1:56:24] He's a different kind of a man.
[1:56:27] He's not a very visible man. He's a
[1:56:30] pastor. I've never preached in his
[1:56:32] church.
[1:56:38] I've tried to put myself in his place.
[1:56:40] His son had just fell from the fourth
[1:56:43] story of a construction site onto the
[1:56:47] concrete
[1:56:49] and his body was all busted up
[1:56:53] and he laid in hospital emergency
[1:56:56] and brother Ron Spencer's dad drove to
[1:56:59] the hospital.
[1:57:02] This is what I'm talking about tonight,
[1:57:04] friends, this morning.
[1:57:06] And he talks to the doctor and doctors
[1:57:08] today, you know, they want to be very
[1:57:10] upfront. And he said, "I want you to
[1:57:12] know, Mr. Spencer,
[1:57:14] your son will never walk again."
[1:57:18] He's not rushing in to see how the how
[1:57:20] the boy is.
[1:57:23] He says to the doctor with all due
[1:57:25] respect, and he was not being
[1:57:26] disrespectful,
[1:57:29] he said, "Sir,
[1:57:31] you just don't know who you're talking
[1:57:32] to."
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; And he walks into his son
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; laying there on the bed.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; He doesn't say how many bones are broken
[1:57:43] or what. All all broken all up. He said,
[1:57:46] "Son, you are my son,
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; and I'm a son of God,
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; and you and I are gonna walk out of this
[1:57:55] hospital."
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what they did.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; And brother Ron Spencer went to work on
[1:58:02] Sunday on Monday morning.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; I say, friends, that's when a man meets
[1:58:08] eternity
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; and he COMES TO THE REALIZATION, I DON'T
[1:58:12] KNOW WHAT HE'S been through.
[1:58:16] And if I just tried that in our own
[1:58:18] effort, it won't work.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; But when God does something, he wants a
[1:58:22] response inside. I will do that.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; I will believe that.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; And to be faithful. IF YOU'RE DOUBTING,
[1:58:31] IT'LL NEVER WORK.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Never work.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh God, help thou my unbelief.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Help me to have faith. Strengthen our
[1:58:40] faith."
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; LET THIS CONGREGATION SAY, "STRENGTHEN
[1:58:42] OUR FAITH, oh God.
[1:58:46] Not just that we'll SEE MORE MIRACLES.
[1:58:48] THAT'S NOT IT. That I'll walk like a son
[1:58:50] of God.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; I'll live like a daughter of God.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Who can know what God's program is?
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Even you here, he may have you work at a
[1:59:06] certain job. He may have you be in a
[1:59:08] certain place forever so long.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; You wonder what's going on. Don't worry.
[1:59:14] My God had no beginning and he had no
[1:59:16] end.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; If I'm here for 50, 60 years and I do
[1:59:20] one thing that he'll get glory.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; I say all glory to him.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; That's what I WANT THIS CONGREGATION TO
[1:59:28] GET. GLORY to God.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; We don't want people healed so they're
[1:59:32] free from pain. We don't want people
[1:59:35] healed because they'll fill a place in
[1:59:37] our heart. We want people healed so
[1:59:39] they'll give glory to God.
[1:59:42] Hallelujah.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; We don't know why things happen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Things that happen maybe are so
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; earthshattering,
[1:59:53] traumatic to us.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; But we don't know
[2:00:00] what God's plan is.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; I was in this city when I heard that
[2:00:06] brother Brandham was in an accident.
[2:00:11] Well, it didn't even enter my cross my
[2:00:13] mind, brother Tom. Never even crossed my
[2:00:16] mind. Well, he'll just raise up because
[2:00:18] we're going to the next meetings. Where,
[2:00:20] you know, who are we thinking of? Me.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Selfie.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Selfie was only invented in this time,
[2:00:27] but it was way back then.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; He can't go. I I got to hear him. I want
[2:00:32] to hear the next service. There are
[2:00:34] thousands of other people thinking the
[2:00:36] same thing. All right.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; God knew
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; this message
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; and this messenger
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; that had intercepted intercepted time
[2:00:46] with a special message FOR A GROUP OF
[2:00:49] people that have got to hear it.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; And God knew what he was going to do as
[2:00:53] a result of it. And then people became
[2:00:55] gripped with it. And this word has to go
[2:00:58] out. And this MESSAGE HAS TO GO OUT.
[2:01:00] There's somebody that's waiting for it.
[2:01:03] There's somebody in Ethiopia that was
[2:01:05] waiting for it, wasn't there, brother
[2:01:07] Tim? They were waiting for it until
[2:01:09] brother Bus a few days later is going to
[2:01:11] leave them about 13 that have been
[2:01:13] baptized. Are are you now going to leave
[2:01:15] us? And the prophet said, "Could they go
[2:01:18] back to the old form of synagogues?" No,
[2:01:21] they could not go back.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; So what are we going to do?
[2:01:26] Well, we do whatever we need to do.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Whatever's necessary. Amen.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Come on children,
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; be men of faith. Whatever is necessary,
[2:01:37] that will we do. Speak Lord and I will
[2:01:41] answer. AND YOU SAY THAT, SPEAK LORD.
[2:01:44] And he may be changing. He may be saying
[2:01:46] TO YOU, YOUR NATURE needs to change. YOU
[2:01:49] SAY, I AGREE. OH GOD, CHANGE MY NATURE.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; MAKE ME A STALWARD BELIEVER.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Remove all this wishy-washy out of me.
[2:01:59] remove all this up and down out of me.
[2:02:02] Make me a son of God.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Develop in me what you need.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; So with this I'm closing now. I'm sorry.
[2:02:14] So John's gospel
[2:02:18] it's very different
[2:02:25] in in my commission. Now I'm going to
[2:02:27] close with these words.
[2:02:29] in a in a few minutes.
[2:02:32] And brother Benam is saying, "And when
[2:02:34] he came," speaking of the angel, "and he
[2:02:37] told me this time he looked, it was a
[2:02:41] man.
[2:02:42] When I told him that I was afraid people
[2:02:44] wouldn't believe me, he said I'd be
[2:02:48] given two signs
[2:02:51] as the prophet Moses was given to
[2:02:54] vindicate or to other in other words to
[2:02:58] make plain to you
[2:03:01] to make plain to you people or to any
[2:03:05] people that I'm telling the truth.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; We're part of those people.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Do you believe that?
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; You believe that an angel from God,
[2:03:18] hear me?
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Hear me folks. An angel from God
[2:03:26] is coming on orders from God say, "This
[2:03:29] will be given to make you and other
[2:03:32] people to believe you that you're
[2:03:34] telling the truth
[2:03:37] and make it plain to them." He says,
[2:03:40] 'Now the man can say anything. Now man,
[2:03:43] he said, can say anything,
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; but if God doesn't speak back that
[2:03:48] that's true,
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; then it isn't true.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't that clear?
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; If God doesn't speak back, then it isn't
[2:03:58] true. But if God testifies that that is
[2:04:02] truth, then I would be believe it. If
[2:04:06] God said so, I would believe it. Now, I
[2:04:09] want you to believe that it's true.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; God couldn't speak any louder.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; God couldn't say it more ways.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Hear me. Look at me. God was speaking.
[2:04:23] And God has told this generation
[2:04:26] that which he spoke is true. Amen.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; And then he told me, he said, "I would I
[2:04:37] would know diseases by taking hold of a
[2:04:39] person's hand first, and if I'd be
[2:04:42] reverent and go on, it would come to
[2:04:44] pass at a certain time that I would be
[2:04:47] able to know the things that people done
[2:04:52] in their back life." Amen.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; And be able to tell them what would be
[2:04:56] before them. And then listen, I've
[2:05:00] highlighted this. And then
[2:05:03] while I studied a moment,
[2:05:06] he referred me to the scriptures
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; that I many times do
[2:05:13] about Jesus of Nazareth,
[2:05:16] knowing that he was misunderstood
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; and let me know that I would be
[2:05:21] misunderstood.
[2:05:22] And he goes on in this same service of
[2:05:25] my commission and he speaks of
[2:05:27] Nathaniel.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's just where this angel
[2:05:32] referred to."
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; And then he speaks of the woman at the
[2:05:37] well. They're not in Matthew, Mark, or
[2:05:40] Luke. They're all in John.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Nathaniel is in John. The woman at the
[2:05:45] well is in John. And then from there, he
[2:05:48] goes right on to Lazarus. And Lazarus is
[2:05:50] in John. He said, "This angel referred
[2:05:53] me to several scriptures, some
[2:05:54] scriptures that I often use." Those are
[2:05:58] the scriptures that he often uses. And I
[2:06:01] want to say WITHOUT ANY APOLOGY, IT
[2:06:04] WORKS.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; IT WORKS.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; THE SAME God
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; that spoke to the woman at THE WELL.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD that raised Lazarus from
[2:06:14] the dead. THE SAME GOD THAT TOLD
[2:06:16] NATHANIEL, "I SAW YOU SITTING UNDER THE
[2:06:19] TREE." THAT SAME GOD GAVE THIS MESSAGE
[2:06:22] TO US.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD,
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, said to me, you have three
[2:06:28] questions on your heart.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; And he named all THREE QUESTIONS. THAT'S
[2:06:32] THE SAME GOD. And that is when I
[2:06:34] realized, I MET ETERNITY. Brother Tim,
[2:06:37] brother John, we met eternity.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; This is a different kind of ministry
[2:06:42] that we have. We're ministering to
[2:06:44] eternal creatures.
[2:06:47] ETERNITY IS SWALLOWING UP TIME, FRIENDS.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; I do.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart and I'm
[2:07:00] so glad
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; to be accompanied with you.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[2:07:08] Dear heavenly father,
[2:07:11] our father,
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; what a kind
[2:07:16] father you are.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, you've provided food for our
[2:07:22] natural life,
[2:07:24] but that doesn't mean much compared to
[2:07:29] the food that we receive spiritually.
[2:07:33] I pray that the people will there's
[2:07:36] people in other churches all throughout
[2:07:38] the land that call this a sermon.
[2:07:41] And if we tend to think of it as a
[2:07:43] sermon, I pray that you'll remove that
[2:07:45] from our thoughts
[2:07:47] and let people know and let there be a a
[2:07:50] confession on their lips. I've heard
[2:07:52] from God.
[2:07:54] God by his Holy Spirit spoke to me this
[2:07:57] morning and what he said I will do. I'm
[2:08:01] prepared. I I desire to do everything
[2:08:03] that I can for the kingdom of God.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; I pray that you will bless, Father, this
[2:08:09] congregation.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Bless all that we seek to do for the
[2:08:13] kingdom of God. Bless in the service
[2:08:15] this evening. Father, I pray in Jesus
[2:08:18] Christ's name as we each dedicate
[2:08:20] ourselves to you
[2:08:23] for your glory
[2:08:26] for the furtherance of your kingdom.
[2:08:28] Lord, we want to be faithful till the
[2:08:30] last moment
[2:08:33] and then we'll drop our implement
[2:08:36] and be changed.
[2:08:38] Thank you, Father.
[2:08:42] Brother Matthew Redell has requested
[2:08:44] prayer and earth going down to be with
[2:08:47] brother Puit
[2:08:50] and a meetings
[2:08:53] the youth camp and they're interested in
[2:08:57] what has been happening with the
[2:08:59] witnessing and several of you that have
[2:09:00] been witnessing of desire to go. I
[2:09:04] believe brother Jonathan Frey
[2:09:06] if you'd come brother Michael Daz is it
[2:09:11] is it Michael are you coming if you'd
[2:09:14] just come and stand here and we're going
[2:09:15] to have prayer with you and one more is
[2:09:20] a third one
[2:09:22] pardon
[2:09:26] all right fine fine thank you
[2:09:29] and we're just going to have prayer
[2:09:31] together for
[2:09:37] going to pray that God will prosper the
[2:09:39] way
[2:09:42] and that you'll realize after this
[2:09:44] morning's service.
[2:09:47] God is a God of eternity. He's only
[2:09:49] interested in eternal things.
[2:09:52] That's what we're here commissioned to
[2:09:55] do. And it's our Lord Jesus Christ who
[2:09:58] said, "You shall be witnesses."
[2:10:01] This is the greatest thing that a person
[2:10:03] can do.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Is to present someone else maybe with an
[2:10:07] opportunity.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; We will pray together.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; we join hearts attribute to attribute.
[2:10:20] We ask, oh God, the same God that has
[2:10:23] dealt and dealt in the hearts of this
[2:10:25] young man, dealt in the hearts of our
[2:10:28] brother Matthew has given him burden. Oh
[2:10:32] God, has spent endless hours, Father,
[2:10:36] desiring to put groups together, oh God,
[2:10:40] and to share a burden with them. We
[2:10:44] pray, Father, that there be a flame of
[2:10:46] fire. May a flame of the Holy Spirit go
[2:10:51] before them, oh pillar of fire go with
[2:10:54] them, I pray, and not only give safe
[2:10:56] journey, but we pray that when their
[2:10:58] feet arrive on the site, that every
[2:11:01] desire that our brother Tim Prud has had
[2:11:03] in his heart, bring it to fruition, oh
[2:11:06] God. And may these brothers indeed be
[2:11:09] willing, oh God. And let them be and let
[2:11:13] them be ready, oh Father, to obey and be
[2:11:16] obedient to your voice,
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; and your calling, oh God. I pray that
[2:11:22] you will unite them. Let them be in one
[2:11:25] spirit, in one mind. Pray, oh God,
[2:11:28] you'll bless the meetings there. Pray oh
[2:11:30] God that you move upon the hearts of
[2:11:32] many and those that you have ordained to
[2:11:35] speak. Oh God may they speak fearlessly.
[2:11:39] It's been where our brother John Andy's
[2:11:41] has been in the past. Pray oh God the
[2:11:44] mighty Holy Spirit. Let them take that
[2:11:46] more than just a youth meeting.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Let them take it as an opportunity. Oh
[2:11:50] God.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; This may be their last gathering. Who
[2:11:53] knows?
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; But your will be done. Lord, we dedicate
[2:11:57] these brothers and we dedicate ourselves
[2:12:00] to you and I dedicate myself. Oh God,
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; we say thy will be done. Lord,
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; we say thy glory. Thy name receive all
[2:12:10] the glory. All the glory,
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; we shall glorify your name. Lord,
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; oh father,
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name, we dedicate ourselves.
[2:12:21] May the congregation all stand please as
[2:12:24] we dedicate ourselves to God
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; in prayer.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, I pray
[2:12:33] as we give ourselves to you
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; at this time, Lord,
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; my heart has been burdened for some that
[2:12:40] are here in this building.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Oh God, let them break out of the shell.
[2:12:48] Let them break out of the pride. Let
[2:12:51] them break out, oh God, and say, "I will
[2:12:55] go to my father. You will receive us." I
[2:13:00] wonder if even while we're praying,
[2:13:02] maybe someone needs to come down here to
[2:13:05] the front and be prayed with.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; I say to you in the name of the Lord,
[2:13:11] there's deliverance for you.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; The ones beside you are mortal beings
[2:14:21] with immortal life in them. But talk to
[2:14:23] the immortal God. Oh father, I pray that
[2:14:28] this will not be in vain. But this
[2:14:29] moment, oh God, will be a time when
[2:14:33] children, your children will talk to you
[2:14:36] in the sanctuary, oh God, where we have

[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Mothers and dads, we're so thankful
[2:23:15] we're not chasing out in the wilderness
[2:23:17] someplace. God, God be praised. And we
[2:23:20] have our young people around us. And
[2:23:23] some may be weward, but we pray, "Oh
[2:23:25] God, go and get them. You know where
[2:23:27] they are. Fetch them.
[2:23:30] Arrest them. Arrest them.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Bring them into the fold. In the name of
[2:23:38] Jesus Christ, let us as every believer
[2:23:41] dedicate ourselves.
[2:23:44] Thy will be done on earth as it is in
[2:23:46] heaven."
[2:23:48] Father,
[2:23:49] we thank you for the hearts and what
[2:23:52] you've placed in the hearts of
[2:23:54] believers. It cannot be bought with
[2:23:57] money. It is the most priceless thing.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; We have Jesus within us.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; We have the Holy Spirit within us.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; And you said, "I will be in you.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; And I will never leave you nor forsake
[2:24:12] you."
[2:24:13] I pray that you'll be with us this
[2:24:14] afternoon, oh God, as we prepare for
[2:24:16] this evening service.
[2:24:18] I ask that you'll give our brother Tim
[2:24:20] Dodd such divine guidance, oh God.
[2:24:24] You'll anoint, Father, this service. We
[2:24:26] need it. And our bride of Jesus Christ,
[2:24:30] our members of the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:24:32] in Ethiopia and Uganda and other parts
[2:24:35] of Africa, bless them, I pray. In China,
[2:24:39] bless them, I pray.
[2:24:42] Mighty God, let us have a victorious
[2:24:45] victorious entrance into the rapture. I
[2:24:48] pray,
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; all glory to our Lord Jesus.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:59] I feel we'd be short if we didn't just
[2:25:01] sing all hail King Jesus. All hail
[2:25:04] Emmanuel. And then you'll be dismissed.
[2:25:07] But I'd like everybody to raise their
[2:25:09] voice
[2:25:11] like it's their last breath on earth.
[2:25:14] All hail King Jesus.
[2:25:17] All hail Emmanuel.
[2:25:22] Hallelujah.

[2:26:06] now.

[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; He hears you.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; He hears us. Oh.

[2:26:21] Lord
[2:26:24] my glory
[2:26:29] and through all
[2:26:32] eternity
[2:26:34] I'm going to praise him
[2:26:40] and forever
[2:26:42] more I will be

[2:26:53] name of Jesus Christ. When you shake
[2:26:56] hands with one another, they shall know
[2:26:59] they're shaking hands with the peace of
[2:27:01] eternity.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. You're
[2:27:05] dismissed. We'll be here this evening.
