[13:46] We ask brother John Stall, senior.
[13:48] Brother John, if you'd come,
[13:51] open the service in a word of prayer.
[13:57] Sister Roxanne has a couple of prayer
[13:59] requests. First off, she would like to
[14:01] say, "My dad wishes to thank everyone
[14:04] for their prayers. He's doing really
[14:06] well and has had a a good report from
[14:08] his doctor. He's trusting God for a
[14:11] complete healing. So, we want to thank
[14:12] the Lord for that.
[14:15] Also, Sister Roxan has a note here. My
[14:17] brother Daniel asked that we pray for
[14:19] one of his students who is a Catholic
[14:22] man who is searching and is unhappy with
[14:24] the church. Daniel gave him the message,
[14:26] God is his own interpreter on CD. pray
[14:30] for guidance and wisdom for Daniel to uh
[14:34] his life as well.
[14:44] We got a prayer request here. Please
[14:47] pray for please remember the St. John's
[14:49] in prayer. In two days a great financial
[14:52] burden could be lifted if the Lord will
[14:54] provide a decision in in our favor.
[14:57] Amen. We thank you so much and God bless
[15:00] you. Amen. We want to remember the St.
[15:02] John's tonight.
[15:04] Amen. If you have a need this morning,
[15:07] if you're on the telephone hookup on the
[15:08] internet,
[15:10] I just ask that you stand with us. Raise
[15:12] your hand and hearts as we go to prayer.
[15:14] Brother John, if you'd come,
[15:21] let's all bow our heads in reverence to
[15:24] God.
[15:26] We're here this morning, Lord Jesus, to
[15:28] praise your holy name. Almighty creator
[15:31] of heavens and earth. Nothing is too big
[15:33] or too small for you, Lord, that you not
[15:35] intervene in our behalf. We're here to
[15:38] praise you, for the stones will not
[15:39] praise you. The dead will not raise your
[15:41] name up either. You are the God of all
[15:44] the universe. For every tongue shall
[15:46] confess, every knee shall bow that they
[15:48] are God. There is no other God before
[15:51] us. You are the king of kings, the god
[15:53] of all gods and and and lord of all
[15:56] lords. There is none but you lord. Oh
[15:59] there's no other existence in the whole
[16:01] universe but and all power and glory
[16:03] flows from you. You are the tree of
[16:05] life. You are the fountain of living
[16:06] waters from where power flows flows
[16:10] through to us. Oh God so that we can
[16:12] live day by day being being subject to
[16:15] your will and way for this purpose you
[16:17] have placed us here on this earth. And
[16:19] now, oh Lord God, for these requests
[16:21] which have been pinned down and written,
[16:22] Lord, for sister Roxanne, oh God, giving
[16:24] you thanks, Lord, for what you have done
[16:26] in the lives of her family, oh God, we

[16:30] morning, Lord, and there is and the and
[16:32] the utterance of praises and glory to
[16:34] your most holy name, Lord. And for this

[18:21] Lord would be poured out from the mount
[18:23] of the minister which would be speaking
[18:24] and sitting behind his sacred desk.

[30:02] what?
[30:03] &gt;&gt; For what?
[30:04] &gt;&gt; He's done.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; He's done
[30:06] &gt;&gt; for me.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; For me,
[30:09] &gt;&gt; redeemed.
[30:12] And you set me free.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; You set me free.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Because

[30:58] &gt;&gt; For me,
[31:01] &gt;&gt; redeemed.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; You redeemed me.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; And you set me free.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; You set me free.
[31:09] [Music]
[31:10] And because
[31:12] &gt;&gt; just
[31:13] [Music]
[31:16] because
[31:18] we love you
[31:19] &gt;&gt; just because
[31:21] we praise you because
[31:25] &gt;&gt; just because
[31:28] [Music]
[31:38] Hallelujah.
[31:40] Glory, glory, glory, glory.
[31:44] Oh, to the majesty of our Lord God.
[31:48] And because he's God, we're here today
[31:53] because he's God, we're cleansed from
[31:57] our sin and unbelief.
[32:00] Bless his name. Bless his name.
[32:03] Heavenly Father, we've sung psalms
[32:07] and we have prayed prayers. Our brother
[32:11] John Stall
[32:13] moved by the Holy Spirit as he prayed,
[32:16] sensing, oh God, your spirit continuing.
[32:20] And as our
[32:22] choir singing, oh God, and the people
[32:25] singing and we're worshiping you, we
[32:28] pray that you'll be pleased
[32:30] to be amongst us.
[32:33] Not only in the service now but
[32:36] throughout this day.
[32:38] Not only in this building but where the
[32:41] many other places where people are
[32:43] worshiping with us just now.
[32:46] They may be a hospital room. Oh God in a
[32:50] home where others are gathered
[32:53] across the seas in other lands. But we
[32:56] are here, oh God, to be inspired by the
[33:00] Holy One of Israel. And we pray that
[33:03] this day shall be a dedicated day to you
[33:06] and the service this evening, Lord, and
[33:09] your servant, our brother Lance, as he
[33:11] will speak and take the word, oh God.
[33:13] And in the coming days, Father, we think
[33:16] of the young people gathering. And Lord,
[33:18] we do not want to simply have
[33:21] set times when we gather, but we pray
[33:26] that you will be in attendance at every
[33:28] one of these meetings and gatherings. Oh
[33:31] God,
[33:33] now Lord, as we're approaching your word
[33:35] shortly, pray that you will anoint us
[33:38] mightily. We thank you for dedicated
[33:41] lives.
[33:43] We thank you, oh God, for the riches we
[33:45] have in Christ Jesus.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Your will now be done. We pray in Jesus
[33:50] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[33:54] you, choir. Thank you.
[34:06] Well, we are happy to be able to report
[34:09] that the saints in China were set free.
[34:13] Amen.
[34:24] This last week, I believe Thursday
[34:26] evening. We don't have any other
[34:28] details.
[34:30] Uh we just know that they've been set
[34:32] free. And I haven't had a chance to
[34:35] uh to speak yet with uh
[34:38] those that may have more more knowledge
[34:40] of it, but that's just what we've heard.
[34:43] Also see brother Ernie's back. My just
[34:47] good to see you. I saw you on the little
[34:49] monitor there and it just warmed my
[34:50] heart, brother Ernie. And we need to
[34:52] hear about the Philippines. We there's
[34:56] been some outstanding things. I I I
[34:58] don't think that things happen, you
[35:00] know, just by accident.
[35:03] uh there there isn't anyone of us and
[35:06] there is no human that can really
[35:11] determine the full effect of what the
[35:13] message has been doing in the
[35:15] Philippines many parts of the world but
[35:18] the Philippines we're speaking of just
[35:19] now and to think that the people were
[35:21] gathering from
[35:24] all over the islands and ministers in
[35:26] these mystery expo we may call them
[35:28] mystery expo but really what it is it's
[35:30] the word penetrating ing the hearts of
[35:33] the people and the hearts of ministers
[35:36] and our brother Ernie along with the
[35:37] other ministers there have been uh
[35:40] focusing on on men ministers to see
[35:44] where there's an open door and been let
[35:47] getting the message out into the into
[35:49] the country uh and ministers from all
[35:52] over and some of them now for the second
[35:54] time and others have been rebaptized and
[35:56] taken the message back to their church.
[35:59] Well, it's no mystery to me that right
[36:00] in the midst of all of this, you know,
[36:02] there's a fire and our office is is
[36:06] largely destroyed and we have to move to
[36:08] another place. And it's no mystery to me
[36:11] then that four terrible storms sweep
[36:16] that country and there's still, I think,
[36:18] over a thousand missing and there has
[36:21] been hundreds and hundreds killed. And I
[36:24] don't know if you saw it or not, but it
[36:26] really touched my heart in a picture in
[36:28] the newspaper there. People are are are
[36:32] going single file, a group of them. And
[36:36] uh the first one in the picture is a
[36:38] little girl, probably 11 years old,
[36:41] maybe 12 years old. And she is mud from
[36:44] the top of her head. had a little flimsy
[36:47] dress on, walking over debris and sticks
[36:51] and a slide of some kind of a mudslide
[36:53] where they must have been buried. And
[36:55] she's walking in her bare feet trying to
[36:57] I I I tried to imagine myself walking
[37:00] where she was walking. It was just
[37:03] impossible to think a person could
[37:05] navigate that kind of place. And I I
[37:08] just you know I tell you what that it is
[37:12] no mystery that those things are
[37:14] happening and coinciding all at one
[37:16] time. God is is uh God is speaking and
[37:20] allowing even these disasters to to come
[37:23] to the island such as it is all at the
[37:25] same time. I try to keep myself open and
[37:28] sensitive and you just see these things
[37:30] happening. I feel that we have a part
[37:33] and I'm glad that we're able to play
[37:35] whatever part we're able to play and the
[37:37] brothers who go out from from this
[37:40] congregation here and I pray that God
[37:42] will send them out from many
[37:44] congregations but especially now that
[37:46] God will speak mightily to the people of
[37:50] the Philippines. Who knows if all of
[37:53] this happened and we know that God
[37:55] doesn't send disasters but he can use
[37:58] them.
[37:59] he can use them.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; And so uh uh these disasters come, what
[38:04] would happen if if brother Ernie's trip
[38:07] over there and all the united efforts of
[38:09] all the all the ministers over there and
[38:12] all of the mystery expose and and all of
[38:15] them just got one minister and maybe he
[38:17] took it back to his church and got one
[38:20] person and there was two out of this
[38:22] whole thing. What if the disaster such
[38:24] as we've just had conditioned somebody's
[38:25] heart to say, you know, there must be
[38:27] something else. And and all of these
[38:29] things coming together got one soul.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; It was all worth it.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Worth it a million times worth it. So,
[38:39] we're so thankful that Brother Ernie's
[38:41] back and and we certainly want to have
[38:44] you prepare, Brother Ernie, so we can
[38:47] hear uh not only what's happening, but
[38:49] we I think the church is privileged and
[38:51] I hope you don't weary. We hear of China
[38:54] one week and who knows, you know, we we
[38:57] we get a lot of word and we have a lot
[38:59] of word in our home and now we're able
[39:02] to, you know, to hear what this word is
[39:04] doing elsewhere. All right. We feel
[39:06] privileged about that. I trust
[39:09] I just can't. I'm not made to be able to
[39:11] sit here in this country and just sit
[39:14] and be self-satisfied and eat my food
[39:17] and live in my home and drive my car and
[39:19] come here to this church and not be
[39:22] affected by people who don't have any of
[39:24] that, don't have the message and don't
[39:26] have a church and don't have a building
[39:27] and don't don't have any any music and
[39:30] they don't have any of those things. I
[39:32] just can't sit here and be satisfied. I
[39:34] just think that we need to be a conduit
[39:37] to pour out the blessing. And whether it
[39:39] be through the internet or whether it be
[39:40] over the telephone or whether it be
[39:42] through our offerings or whether it be
[39:43] through trying to help out in another
[39:45] country, I think that God in fact is I
[39:48] know I know that God is pleased with
[39:50] that.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Freely you have received
[39:55] &gt;&gt; freely give.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:05] I think I see
[40:07] uh Sarah here.
[40:10] Sarah Dingwall
[40:13] is brother Jonathan Bergen's fiance. We
[40:16] just announced that their
[40:19] marriage upcoming and uh and nice to
[40:22] have you here Sarah. God bless you.
[40:28] Amen.
[40:29] All right, I'll have you turn in your
[40:31] Bibles to Genesis
[40:35] the 40
[40:37] 5th chapter.
[41:07] And while you're just holding your Bible
[41:09] there,
[41:10] you can give me your attention. I'm
[41:12] going to read three other verses.
[41:16] David said, "Look upon mine affliction
[41:18] and my pain and forgive all my sins."
[41:26] He said again, "Hide thy face from my
[41:28] sins and blot out all mine iniquities."
[41:34] In Isaiah it is said, "Behold, for peace
[41:36] I have great bitterness,
[41:39] but thou hast in love to my soul,
[41:44] delivered it from the pit of corruption.
[41:48] For thou hast cast all my sins behind
[41:52] thy back."
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Are those wonderful words?
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Aren't those wonderful words?
[42:00] and the revelation and from Jesus Christ
[42:04] who is the faithful witness,
[42:06] the first begotten of the dead and the
[42:10] prince of the kings of the earth. Unto
[42:13] him that loved us and washed us from our
[42:17] sins in his own blood. The prophet said
[42:19] he loosed us from our sins. Now we're
[42:23] going to read
[42:28] from the eth from the 1st to the eth
[42:30] verse.
[42:32] Then Joseph could not refrain himself
[42:34] before all them that stood by him. And
[42:38] he cried, "Cause every man to go out
[42:41] from me." And there stood no man with
[42:44] him while Joseph made himself known unto
[42:47] his brethren.
[42:49] And he wept aloud. And the Egyptians and
[42:52] the house of Pharaoh heard.
[42:54] And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am
[42:58] Joseph. Doth my father yet live? And his
[43:03] brethren could not answer him. For they
[43:05] were troubled at his presence. And
[43:08] Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near
[43:11] to me, I pray you. And they came near.
[43:15] And he said, "I am Joseph, your brother,
[43:18] whom ye sold into Egypt. Now therefore,
[43:22] be not grieved nor angry with
[43:24] yourselves, that ye sold me hither. For
[43:29] God did send me before you to preserve
[43:32] life.
[43:33] For these two years hath the famine been
[43:36] in the land, and yet there are five
[43:38] years, in the which there shall neither
[43:41] be earring nor harvest.
[43:45] And God sent me before you to preserve
[43:48] you for a posterity in the earth, and to
[43:52] save your lives in a great deliverance.
[43:57] So now it was not you that sent me
[44:01] Heather, but God, and he hath made me a
[44:04] father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his
[44:08] house, and a ruler throughout all the
[44:11] land of Egypt. May God bless his word to
[44:14] our hearts. Thank you. You may be
[44:16] seated.
[44:22] I want to continue from last week and
[44:25] this may sound like a strange scripture
[44:28] to continue with the subject the blame
[44:31] game
[44:33] part two.
[44:37] I wondered at first if I would ever
[44:39] speak this because
[44:41] it is such a
[44:44] uh it's such a vast subject. that covers
[44:47] such a vast area of human life and our
[44:51] human experience and I just didn't know
[44:53] if I could be adequate. I believe that
[44:56] God helped us last Sunday and I believe
[45:00] that God from the word that I've heard
[45:02] from you. Uh I've had a lot of response
[45:07] both by email and and directly
[45:11] and I I trust that uh this will be
[45:15] continuing that there will be a lasting
[45:18] effect upon you. uh this message did not
[45:22] come you know to just to kind of tickle
[45:24] our ears or to stir us momentarily.
[45:28] The message came to make permanent
[45:30] change within our lives.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said in the message
[45:35] shalom
[45:37] he said crossing the nation and speaking
[45:41] and the Lord God identifying and a
[45:43] vindicating. He's saying a lot here.
[45:45] saying God coming and vindicating and
[45:48] confirming and identifying his word and
[45:51] showing that's exactly and never let
[45:54] nothing be said unless it comes to pass
[45:57] exactly what he said. Now here's a
[45:59] prophet in prophetic me ministry and he
[46:03] said speaking it right into existence
[46:05] and so forth. Look how far that's going.
[46:07] Just to the third pull to that creative
[46:10] word of God coming out of a prophet's
[46:13] mouth and he's been doing and people sit
[46:17] there and look at that
[46:19] and continue right on in the same
[46:22] condition.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Now that was really something. What he's
[46:26] saying is after seeing it vindicating
[46:29] and seeing it confirmed and seeing the
[46:33] word actually in in action, the creative
[46:36] word of God, what he's saying is that
[46:38] there should have been a change.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; He said in uh also in in shalom, these
[46:45] are he said it in Phoenix and said it in
[46:48] Sierra Vista. He said, "I crossed the
[46:50] nation preaching." I think so this was
[46:53] in his mind. He said, "I cross the
[46:56] nation preaching against this thing and
[46:59] come back the next year and it's worse
[47:01] than it was when I started." The He
[47:04] said, "The people want to do right, but
[47:06] there's something about it that won't
[47:08] let them do right. It just presses down
[47:10] on them, forces them. It's like a heavy
[47:13] dark fog over the whole earth. Not only
[47:15] in Phoenix, but all over the world.
[47:18] There seems to be just a groping
[47:20] darkness that's gathering, getting more
[47:22] dense and dense all the time, just
[47:25] smothering out real manhood and
[47:28] womanhood. And so here we are many years
[47:31] down the road from that. And it's it
[47:33] it's heavier now. I'll say the fog's
[47:36] thicker now.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; And it's a heavier weight even now. But
[47:41] the word of God which came, the message
[47:43] which came is not only adequate, but
[47:45] it's more than sufficient. Do you
[47:47] believe that?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; More than sufficient for us. And so I am
[47:52] speaking because I I desire that if God
[47:56] uh initiates something in your heart uh
[47:59] within your own self that you sense
[48:03] there God is speaking to me through this
[48:05] word. I pray that you will take that and
[48:07] say, uh, God, make this to be a a a
[48:12] substance in my life that will be uh
[48:15] that will have continuity, that it's not
[48:18] just something I just have a a stir
[48:21] during a service in a Sunday morning,
[48:23] but that God uh continues that in my
[48:27] life and some corrective measure, let it
[48:29] continue.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:33] I want to take this uh the blame game
[48:38] and and be weaving in three different
[48:42] thoughts.
[48:44] Last Sunday I took the blame game just
[48:47] shifting the blame onto elsewhere
[48:51] for things that have occurred in our
[48:54] lives. And like I said, it covers such a
[48:56] broad expanse
[48:59] of of our life. It can go from childhood
[49:02] in some cases,
[49:05] from married life.
[49:09] It can be abuse of all kinds. Such a
[49:12] broad scope of of events that can and
[49:17] has taken place. And there isn't anyone
[49:21] that has not been touched by this and
[49:24] affected by it one way or another.
[49:27] uh and there isn't anyone but what we
[49:30] have engaged in placing the blame
[49:33] elsewhere
[49:36] &gt;&gt; and so even this phrase is very very
[49:39] common today and there you know who's to
[49:41] blame for uh uh 911 and who's to blame
[49:47] for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ
[49:49] that's been going on for 2,000 years the
[49:52] Catholics say the Jews are the Jews say
[49:54] the Catholics were the Romans were and
[49:56] Everybody says, "Well, I tell you what,
[49:58] it was God who led the lamb to Calvary."
[50:02] &gt;&gt; And if they only would read the
[50:03] scripture, they would know that. But but
[50:05] it's just it's just that spirit of the
[50:07] age that's here. It's always someone
[50:09] else's fault. And in blaming someone
[50:11] else, then we get a sense of
[50:13] justification.
[50:15] So I want to that I'll I'll touch on a
[50:17] little bit more of that. And secondly,
[50:21] there is also this that I have observed
[50:24] where some people are made up in a just
[50:27] a certain way where they are they are so
[50:30] self-examining of themselves that they
[50:34] place all the blame for things upon
[50:36] themselves and I'm a failure and I'm no
[50:39] good and all the rest of it and give
[50:41] Satan an advantage for condemnation
[50:45] &gt;&gt; and that also is a great error.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the third which I want to
[50:50] which our scripture bears out today is
[50:54] where a person takes all the blame upon
[50:57] themselves
[50:59] in the in the spirit of Christ so that
[51:03] uh there is there is none of this trying
[51:06] to discover what degree of fault is
[51:10] yours.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; You're 40% to blame. I'm 60% to blame.
[51:14] You're 90% to blame. I'm 10% and and you
[51:18] did and I did and they said and he said
[51:20] and she said and that and then this
[51:22] happened and then that happened. That
[51:24] gets absolutely nowhere.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; That gets absolutely nowhere.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you it's
[51:30] unscriptural.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Going to show you in the scripture that
[51:33] it's unscriptural.
[51:35] And so now we have read this uh
[51:38] scripture concerning Joseph and his
[51:40] brethren coming to him. I thought as I
[51:43] read this, what a perfect opportunity
[51:48] Joseph had. Now, you have to remember
[51:50] many years have gone by from a young man
[51:55] now sold and finally comes into Egypt
[51:58] and and he goes through all of his his
[52:01] trials in Egypt and and uh uh even
[52:04] Pharaoh's wife seeking to tempt him to
[52:07] an adultery and then going into prison
[52:10] for two years uh because of her lie and
[52:14] because of all of this. And he was he
[52:16] was he was perfection.
[52:19] He was a perfect type of Christ, but it
[52:21] was being lived out in a very ordinary
[52:24] life. He lived a life like you and I. He
[52:27] felt like you and I did. And now he's
[52:29] standing there in all of his royalty and
[52:32] the in the glory of the nation and the
[52:34] power, an interpreter of dreams, a
[52:36] dreamer of dreams, an interpreter of
[52:38] dreams. And and and now has risen. He's,
[52:41] as he said, he's become a father to
[52:43] Pharaoh. And he's standing there in all
[52:46] of that in all of that riches and all of
[52:49] that vindication. And now his dream from
[52:52] many many many years ago uh has come to
[52:56] pass. And here is his brothers uh uh
[52:59] kneeling before him, frustrating
[53:01] themselves before him. He could have
[53:03] said, "I told you so. I'm Joseph."
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Now it's finally come to pass when I
[53:11] spoke it. I want you to know that that's
[53:13] the God that I serve. He had the most He
[53:16] had the most, I would say, perfect
[53:18] opportunity to cause them to gravel
[53:22] &gt;&gt; before him in their utter failure and in
[53:26] their despair and all of the rest of it.
[53:29] He could have rubbed their noses down
[53:31] into the ground and said, "You deserved
[53:33] it and now you're getting it."
[53:38] &gt;&gt; What an opportunity. Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Notice in his in his comments here which
[53:44] is in the word of God because he had to
[53:48] live out the perfect type of Christ. He
[53:52] could not bring up any of their failure.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Even though they had failed, listen,
[53:59] they hated him. The scripture tells us
[54:03] they were jealous of him. The scripture
[54:05] tells us they were jealous of the favor
[54:08] because he was a favorite son of his
[54:10] father and had the coat of many colors.
[54:13] They were jealous over that. And because
[54:15] he was a dreamer of dreams, they hated
[54:18] him more.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; And because of the dreams which even
[54:23] involved his mother and father, the
[54:25] scripture tells us that they didn't
[54:27] understand him,
[54:28] &gt;&gt; that they felt something against him.
[54:32] And so he had all of these things. this
[54:34] jealousy. He could have thought of them
[54:37] throwing him in the pit. He could have
[54:40] thought of them uh lying to his father
[54:45] knowing that his father was living all
[54:48] these years with the grief of his lost
[54:52] son being destroyed.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; I'd lost a son. And in fact is when
[54:57] these uh when his brothers were standing
[55:00] before him and he wanted to you know uh
[55:02] cause them to to to say what was in
[55:05] their heart. He said you know you're
[55:07] spies. No they said we're not spies. We
[55:10] are 12 sons of of a man and uh we're not
[55:15] spies and the youngest of us is still
[55:18] with their father and one is not
[55:23] standing right there in front of them.
[55:24] Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; And one is not. They said it twice. And
[55:29] one is not.
[55:32] What a statement. And one is not. But
[55:35] there he was. You know something? We've
[55:38] all been in that place. We didn't know
[55:40] where God is, where where's our
[55:42] redemption, where is our salvation,
[55:44] where's our deliverance, and stand right
[55:46] in front of us. Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; The one we thought was not in your life
[55:53] was standing right there. He was going
[55:55] to interrupt you someplace along the
[55:57] along the way.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; You thought he was not. Maybe today you
[56:02] walked in and you haven't really had a
[56:04] lot of very deep spiritual thought and
[56:06] and you're in church and you're you know
[56:09] you've been going through the service
[56:10] and so on so forth, but maybe in your
[56:12] mind he's quite distant. But yet in as
[56:15] far as God is concerned, he's right
[56:16] there before you, in front of you, ready
[56:19] to do what you need to have done.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; And we thought, well, he's not, but he
[56:24] is.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; The agony of his father that his father
[56:31] endured. He had all of these things, but
[56:34] he did not engage in the so common and
[56:38] so human thing of placing blame. He
[56:43] could never have portrayed Christ had he
[56:48] placed the blame.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; But what an opportunity. And they were
[56:52] to fault. They were to blame. But he saw
[56:55] something greater. He saw the bigger
[56:58] picture. He said, "It wasn't you in the
[57:00] first place. It wasn't you that sold me
[57:02] into Egypt. God brought me here."
[57:06] &gt;&gt; He saw the bigger picture of the thing
[57:08] that was happening. Every single person
[57:11] here in this building has had great
[57:14] adversity take place in their lives. And
[57:17] you you uh uh
[57:21] have every reason to believe. In fact,
[57:24] as you may be sitting there and saying,
[57:25] "But brother Ed, this did happen." And
[57:28] it was her fault. It was his fault. It
[57:31] was their fault. It was my employer, my
[57:34] wife, my husband, my children, my
[57:36] parents. It was their fault. They did do
[57:38] this. And this has I am sitting here
[57:41] today because this happened. But you
[57:43] need to rise above and see a bigger
[57:45] picture.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; You need to see a bigger picture. You
[57:50] have to say today God has allowed this
[57:54] or it wouldn't be this way.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, sin did it. The devil
[57:59] did it. Whoever did it, but God
[58:01] permitted it." Or you wouldn't be. If
[58:03] you're a son and daughter of God, God
[58:05] has allowed it.
[58:08] And you need to get to rise to that
[58:10] place and then that will open the door
[58:13] for the correct attitude towards it
[58:17] &gt;&gt; to deal with it in the right way.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; It is said then said Jesus.
[58:29] Now he could have said he could have
[58:32] laid the blame upon them but then said
[58:34] Jesus father forgives them. Listen for
[58:39] they know not what they do.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; And they parted his raignment and cast
[58:46] lots and there he is stripped naked in
[58:49] open shame bearing our shame and bearing
[58:53] our sin.
[58:55] certainly wasn't for anything that he
[58:56] did that he was hanging there suffering
[58:58] this terrible terrible death
[59:03] &gt;&gt; but it is human
[59:07] and we come by it
[59:10] in a very natural way because our first
[59:15] parents did it and that's where I
[59:17] started last Sunday and God said to Adam
[59:20] hast thou eaten of the tree
[59:24] and he said, "The woman that you gave
[59:27] me,
[59:28] she gave it to me and I did eat." In
[59:32] other words, if you hadn't created her
[59:33] in the first place
[59:38] and brought her to me,
[59:40] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be in this fix.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; No. the woman that you gave, she gave it
[59:48] to me and I did eat. And he said to the
[59:53] woman, "What is this that thou hast
[59:55] done?" And the woman said, "The serpent
[59:58] beguiled me." In fact, he deceived me.
[1:00:02] And brother Brandham said, "Deception,
[1:00:05] of course, is when you don't know that
[1:00:07] you're even doing it.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; You don't know that this is going to go
[1:00:11] where it's going to go." It was a
[1:00:12] deception. And she was, she said, "He
[1:00:15] beguiled me and I did eat." Beguiled,
[1:00:19] not only to deceive, but to mislead by
[1:00:22] guile. And oh, that's a horrible
[1:00:25] practice. And I do see it and I do find
[1:00:27] it when people say something and and and
[1:00:32] they they will make a statement here,
[1:00:34] but they actually want you to believe
[1:00:36] this over here. And that's what happens.
[1:00:38] It goes in a triangle. A statement is
[1:00:41] made, but a person believes this over
[1:00:43] here. What they believe over here is
[1:00:44] actually a lie. But what was said wasn't
[1:00:47] directly a lie, but it was intended that
[1:00:50] you would believe a lie.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; And that's what guile is.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Guile is when you may speak a half a
[1:00:56] truth. You may speak a half a truth but
[1:00:59] it's said in such a way in such a
[1:01:01] manner. It's said with uh uh with the in
[1:01:05] in an opportunity to cause a person to
[1:01:08] believe something false and then that's
[1:01:11] what happens. That is beguiled and and
[1:01:14] to draw away or to charm away. And that
[1:01:17] is what the serpent did. And since that
[1:01:20] time, everybody has engaged, whether you
[1:01:23] want to admit it or not, we have engaged
[1:01:25] in what is known as I said and the title
[1:01:28] of this message in the blame game.
[1:01:33] Everyone,
[1:01:35] who's here that hasn't been hurt?
[1:01:38] Who's here that hasn't been wounded?
[1:01:41] Who's here that hasn't been at some
[1:01:43] point in life Christ?
[1:01:49] David experienced the same.
[1:01:52] And usually it's not some stranger
[1:01:55] walking down the street that just says
[1:01:57] to us in passing, "I hate you." It
[1:01:59] wouldn't mean anything.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I don't know you." You have
[1:02:03] to I have said, and I don't know that
[1:02:06] it's exactly correct or not, but I have
[1:02:08] said because I have believed it. You
[1:02:10] have to love before you can hate.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; You actually have to
[1:02:17] Because hate is a perversion of love.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; And David said, "Yay, my own familiar
[1:02:28] friend in whom I trusted,
[1:02:33] which did eat of my bread.
[1:02:35] We sat at the same table.
[1:02:39] We had fellowship together. We were
[1:02:41] close enough.
[1:02:43] My own familiar friend in whom I
[1:02:45] trusted, which did eat my bread, hath
[1:02:48] lifted up his heel against me. It wasn't
[1:02:51] one that was some enemy down the way,
[1:02:54] but it was my familiar friend, the one
[1:02:56] that was close to me. Jesus said,
[1:03:01] "I speak not to you all.
[1:03:04] I know whom I have chosen, but that the
[1:03:07] scripture might be fulfilled. He that
[1:03:10] eateth bread with me hath lifted up his
[1:03:13] heel against me. That was that was the
[1:03:16] fulfillment of that scripture. But yet
[1:03:19] David experienced the same thing.
[1:03:23] That's what he experienced. He
[1:03:24] experienced it. He actually lived it out
[1:03:26] on that side of the cross. He lived it
[1:03:29] out because he was living out a part of
[1:03:31] Christ. We're on this side of the cross.
[1:03:34] And often we have some here and I'm
[1:03:37] trying to cover a broad scope. uh h of
[1:03:40] of our human experience. But there's
[1:03:43] sometimes and most often it is even
[1:03:45] within a family or an extended family or
[1:03:49] within the congregation because we are a
[1:03:51] family.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; The body of Christ is a family.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; It is the family of God. and and our
[1:04:00] disappointments or our our experiences
[1:04:04] in life, whether it be in our natural
[1:04:06] family or within the spiritual family.
[1:04:09] We can and have experienced crushing
[1:04:14] experiences
[1:04:16] that uh give a open door,
[1:04:21] give a opening for us to and it's only
[1:04:24] natural we would like to place the
[1:04:26] blame. Well, if if he had not done or
[1:04:29] she had not done or if they had done
[1:04:32] this would be different, etc. It can go
[1:04:34] on and on and it does go on and on. And
[1:04:37] so the the the the thing that I find is
[1:04:41] necessary
[1:04:42] is that a person needs to come to a
[1:04:45] place where they can rise in the spirit
[1:04:49] of Christ and be able to cope with these
[1:04:52] things in a in a Christlike way.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this this this service this
[1:04:58] morning is going to be a tall order.
[1:05:01] It's a real tall order.
[1:05:05] So David said, "It's my familiar friend.
[1:05:10] It's somebody that's been trusted,
[1:05:13] somebody that you have given
[1:05:16] you have given yourself to or you have
[1:05:21] uh grown up with or you have you're
[1:05:25] united into perhaps one family unit. And
[1:05:28] this is where it usually starts.
[1:05:29] Remember
[1:05:31] remember now we're we're going back to
[1:05:33] Eden. Eden was the first family unit
[1:05:39] and Satan coming through the
[1:05:41] instrumentality of the serpent. The
[1:05:44] first thing he did was to break up the
[1:05:47] family unit.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; That is his first and and that is his
[1:05:54] first and still his target.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said to me, he said,
[1:05:59] "The sin of the beginning will be the
[1:06:02] sin of the end."
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we as a congregation of
[1:06:06] people, there's no use me talking about,
[1:06:08] you know, pie in the sky things that
[1:06:10] aren't a reality to you. You're nice and
[1:06:12] quiet because these things are a
[1:06:15] reality.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; We have experienced disastrous things.
[1:06:19] In fact is let me go take a step
[1:06:21] further.
[1:06:23] In many cases
[1:06:25] outside of God helping us to cope with
[1:06:28] these things,
[1:06:30] uh there is a there's something within
[1:06:32] the human psyche that can blank those
[1:06:36] things out
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; and the a wall goes up and we've blanked
[1:06:42] out even within our subconscious.
[1:06:45] It just becomes a part of our life.
[1:06:47] Don't go there. I don't go there. Nobody
[1:06:50] goes there. But let me tell you
[1:06:52] something. You have to allow God to go
[1:06:54] there
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; because the scripture says he has sent
[1:06:58] me to heal the brokenhearted.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; A lot of people there, you're perhaps
[1:07:06] even here today and you have gone
[1:07:09] through a crushing, destructive,
[1:07:12] catastrophic experience in life. And it
[1:07:15] might be years ago,
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; but you have never really dealt with it.
[1:07:21] It just remains something that's blocked
[1:07:23] off. It's blanked out. And that it
[1:07:25] happens to be a result of this uh this
[1:07:28] uh evil age which we are in. And let me
[1:07:32] say I want to say so many things here
[1:07:33] today. God give me the strength to say
[1:07:35] it. And we are not getting we're not
[1:07:38] coming to a time when things are going
[1:07:40] to be easier and nicer. The fog is
[1:07:43] getting thicker
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; and the darkness is getting thicker and
[1:07:47] heavier and the weight is getting
[1:07:49] heavier. And what we've experienced here
[1:07:51] is going to be more of it.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; We've got here the the result of many
[1:07:56] broken homes, which is the same serpent
[1:07:59] that crawled into Eden. He's the same
[1:08:01] one that's doing the same thing even at
[1:08:04] this very hour.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; And there's no use us running and hiding
[1:08:08] and putting our head in the sand as
[1:08:10] though these things don't happen. They
[1:08:12] do happen and they have happened and
[1:08:14] they will continue to happen. But we
[1:08:17] need to deal with it in a scriptural
[1:08:19] manner, in a scriptural way. And I can
[1:08:22] tell you one way that will never never
[1:08:24] work. It is to seek where where the
[1:08:26] blame is.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; It's 50% this way, 50 that way. It's 60
[1:08:32] 40 70. It just happens to have happened.
[1:08:36] We got young people that are here that
[1:08:37] have never really known perhaps the life
[1:08:40] with a father or the life with a mother
[1:08:43] or the life of a united home. We have
[1:08:45] others that are completely wonderfully
[1:08:47] united homes. They've never experienced
[1:08:49] a sing. So I don't know what you're
[1:08:51] talking about, brother Biscll.
[1:08:52] Nevertheless, it happens to be a very
[1:08:54] real reality. And it's something that
[1:08:57] the that the gospel of Jesus Christ in
[1:08:59] this end time is going to is coping with
[1:09:02] and and there's power within this
[1:09:04] message to take care of those things.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:12] for someone who has gone through those
[1:09:14] things. There's people there's there's
[1:09:16] young people who who are married here
[1:09:18] who never experienced a united home.
[1:09:20] They didn't have a father and mother in
[1:09:22] the home. And now they are a mother.
[1:09:25] They are a wife. They are a father. They
[1:09:27] are a husband. And they're not too sure
[1:09:29] exactly how to handle it. They've never
[1:09:31] had an example.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; They've never had a father image before
[1:09:36] them. There never had a mother image
[1:09:38] before them. There wasn't a mother
[1:09:40] there. But let me tell you something,
[1:09:42] friends. The author of motherhood
[1:09:44] happens to be represented right here in
[1:09:46] the book. The author of fatherhood
[1:09:49] happens to be represented right here in
[1:09:51] the book. And if we heed and hear what
[1:09:53] God has spoken and allow the Holy Spirit
[1:09:56] to come and infuse us with the same
[1:09:59] spirit of this book, you will have
[1:10:01] motherhood. You will have fatherhood.
[1:10:03] And you won't have to figure out who's
[1:10:05] to follow.
[1:10:15] Sometimes
[1:10:17] the sources
[1:10:21] of these experiences which we have had
[1:10:28] are
[1:10:30] distant. And as I said earlier, and I
[1:10:32] want to just dwell on it a moment,
[1:10:38] so difficult to deal with that even here
[1:10:41] in a service such as we're having
[1:10:44] within the minds of
[1:10:48] there's grown up adults here that were
[1:10:52] abused as children.
[1:10:56] They don't want to go there.
[1:10:58] But I'll tell you one thing, you have to
[1:11:00] let Christ go there.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; You'll have to open up the door to that.
[1:11:04] There's been those that perhaps have
[1:11:06] been abused terribly by an alcoholic
[1:11:12] mother or father,
[1:11:14] and you just can't blank it out like,
[1:11:17] well, it never happened. It doesn't
[1:11:18] exist. All the rest of it, because that
[1:11:20] wound,
[1:11:21] that wound is there.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; And he came to heal the broken
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; hearted. Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; For the spirit of the Lord is upon me.
[1:11:32] And it's the same Christ that's alive
[1:11:34] today. This is the same son of man
[1:11:37] revealed now. When the message came, he
[1:11:40] came with healing in his wings.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; But you can't just hold that off.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; I read of a therapist.
[1:11:49] I read his own account
[1:11:54] and he was counseling a woman
[1:12:01] and in the midst of his counseling and
[1:12:04] when they were at a certain point he
[1:12:06] said to her, "How old do you feel just
[1:12:09] now?" And she said, "Nine."
[1:12:12] Nine years old. Because that is when the
[1:12:15] trauma took place.
[1:12:18] when she finally he finally uh got to
[1:12:21] the point right at the point a critical
[1:12:24] point. How old do you feel just now?
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Nine.
[1:12:30] I feel nine.
[1:12:33] Because now she was back there, not just
[1:12:36] in her memory, but something that was
[1:12:39] blanked out. You see, here's my point.
[1:12:42] You might say, "Well, Brother Bisll, why
[1:12:44] in the world are you speaking to us in
[1:12:46] such a way?" I'll tell you why. Because
[1:12:48] as long as that lays there undelt with,
[1:12:52] Satan knows where that is.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; And he'll come back there and that thing
[1:12:57] will fester and keep rising up at at
[1:13:00] certain times and it'll be this one to
[1:13:03] blame. If I hadn't had this kind of a
[1:13:05] life, hadn't had this kind of a
[1:13:06] childhood, hadn't had this kind of a
[1:13:08] husband or this kind of a wife, my life
[1:13:10] could have been so different. You've got
[1:13:12] to allow Christ to come into that dark
[1:13:14] spot and heal that thing for once and
[1:13:17] for all. And then it'll be done.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; It'll be over.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; It'll be finished.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; And we won't engage in the blame game.
[1:13:32] [Music]
[1:13:35] You know, the world conjures up cute
[1:13:39] little phrases and they might be very
[1:13:41] appropriate. I don't know.
[1:13:44] But phrases that seem to fit certain
[1:13:48] situations
[1:13:50] and certain aspects of our our life. And
[1:13:54] you may have encountered this. I'm not a
[1:13:57] great reader of all kinds of other
[1:13:58] things other than the scriptures and the
[1:14:00] message, but I do a little bit of
[1:14:02] reading.
[1:14:04] And uh there was I I read a just a short
[1:14:09] segment
[1:14:10] of a person's own personal account
[1:14:15] of how they engaged for years in what
[1:14:17] this is known as the blame game.
[1:14:20] And uh apparently they have a a medical
[1:14:26] or psychological
[1:14:28] uh I they identified as borderline
[1:14:31] personality disorder
[1:14:34] BPD.
[1:14:37] And uh this one young fellow said, "In
[1:14:39] my journey of healing from borderline
[1:14:42] personality disorder, without realizing
[1:14:46] it for a great number of years, I was
[1:14:49] constantly blaming others for my
[1:14:52] problems and for my pain."
[1:14:55] He said, "It is very typical for someone
[1:14:58] with this borderline personality
[1:15:00] disorder." And I'm not I I don't say
[1:15:03] that that's what it is.
[1:15:05] In our case, it's the devil.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it.
[1:15:11] But he has identified it and he said uh
[1:15:14] it's very typical for someone with this
[1:15:17] to honestly believe
[1:15:20] while in the throws
[1:15:22] of a distorted thought process that
[1:15:26] everything they feel is someone else's
[1:15:29] fault.
[1:15:30] So often a person with BPD
[1:15:34] will take out their confusion and pain
[1:15:37] on those who try to care.
[1:15:40] Someone comes and tries to be a help and
[1:15:43] an aid and somehow it gets transferred
[1:15:46] even to them on those who try to get
[1:15:50] close and try to stay close. What
[1:15:52] happens when someone tries to care to be
[1:15:55] close for many with this uh this
[1:15:58] disorder is that once a certain line is
[1:16:01] crossed in when they become too close
[1:16:05] then there comes like a transference
[1:16:07] they begin to offload all these things
[1:16:10] onto someone else onto one who's trying
[1:16:12] to help them out of the situation that
[1:16:14] they're in now you might you might just
[1:16:17] wonder now I I've given a lot of thought
[1:16:19] to this the reason I read the scripture
[1:16:22] which I read is because Joseph, not only
[1:16:26] did Joseph not engage in this, but these
[1:16:29] sons, they didn't tell him that they
[1:16:32] were guilty amongst themselves. They
[1:16:35] said, "We be guilty." Because they knew
[1:16:38] each other. And they knew the dark
[1:16:40] things that they had done. They said,
[1:16:42] "We be guilty." But they wouldn't tell
[1:16:45] anybody else. They wouldn't tell their
[1:16:47] father they were guilty. They wouldn't
[1:16:48] tell Joseph they were guilty. They
[1:16:50] didn't tell God they were guilty. They
[1:16:52] just kept it to themselves. We be
[1:16:54] guilty. But when they came now before
[1:16:56] before Joseph, before one who is not.
[1:17:00] He He in their minds, he didn't exist
[1:17:02] anymore. They didn't know what happened
[1:17:04] to him. We sold him. He's gone. We saw
[1:17:06] him just go off in a into the sunset on
[1:17:08] a pack of camels. We don't know what
[1:17:10] happened to him.
[1:17:13] Right.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; And when they're standing before Joseph
[1:17:17] and Joseph, he knew the whole thing. He
[1:17:20] knew it all.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; He knew what happened.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; He He knew he was thrown into a pit. He
[1:17:25] knew he had been sold to the merchants.
[1:17:28] And he knew he had been taken as a slave
[1:17:31] into Egypt. He knew he saw everything.
[1:17:33] He knew everything about it. But he was
[1:17:36] not trying to put any blame on anybody.
[1:17:40] He didn't even put the blame on that
[1:17:42] adulterous woman of Pharaoh's wife.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Could have said that scoundrel, that
[1:17:49] liar tainted my life,
[1:17:53] put a terrible blemish on me and sent me
[1:17:57] to a dungeon, prison, ratinfested place
[1:18:01] with some other prisoners.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Don't you see, friends? He didn't engage
[1:18:08] in that. He had every right
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; and there's people that are here
[1:18:13] including myself and we and we we have
[1:18:17] events we have things which we encounter
[1:18:20] in life and we have somebody there who
[1:18:22] who is in fact to blame but when you see
[1:18:25] the bigger picture it we we're we we
[1:18:28] don't get anywhere by attaching the
[1:18:30] blame it doesn't do anything for us and
[1:18:33] last Sunday I spent most of the time on
[1:18:36] a horrible disastrous ous failure within
[1:18:40] even I'm talking about the bride of
[1:18:42] Jesus Christ. I think that many are
[1:18:44] living so far below where they should be
[1:18:47] living simply because they say well
[1:18:49] because this happened because that
[1:18:51] happened because this terrible
[1:18:52] disappointment because this thing went
[1:18:54] sideways because I experienced this I'm
[1:18:57] letting go of my spiritual convictions
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; and we've experienced it. Well, because
[1:19:05] my parents are this, because my father's
[1:19:07] this, because my children are that, I
[1:19:09] I'm I'm just I I'm not throwing in the
[1:19:12] towel, but Oh, they say, "Well, do you
[1:19:14] deny that there's a message?" Oh, no. I
[1:19:18] don't deny that. Do you deny that
[1:19:20] Brother Brandham is a prophet of God?
[1:19:21] Oh. Oh, no. No. He's He's the prophet.
[1:19:23] I've had people are living right in sin.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Say, "I still believe the message." Oh,
[1:19:28] no you don't.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, no you don't believe the message.
[1:19:32] Because that message wouldn't want that
[1:19:33] doesn't that message doesn't condone
[1:19:36] that kind of thing.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said if you don't do it, you
[1:19:40] don't believe it.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Is that right? You don't do it, you
[1:19:43] don't believe it. So in order to believe
[1:19:44] it, if you really believe it, you do it.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking things that I've never
[1:19:55] spoken before.
[1:19:57] I've had people come into this church
[1:20:00] that have been so wounded,
[1:20:03] whose lives have been so destroyed
[1:20:07] by others
[1:20:09] by others
[1:20:11] been so destroyed. I'm not here to to
[1:20:15] resurrect memories, but those of you
[1:20:19] that feel that you're, you know, you're
[1:20:24] included in this, you allow me this
[1:20:27] because I must I must speak it.
[1:20:31] So destroyed
[1:20:33] by men that were trusted,
[1:20:36] men who were in position and women who
[1:20:39] were in position.
[1:20:41] People had been so trusted. They so gave
[1:20:44] themselves so completely. They'd had
[1:20:46] done anything for those people. They so
[1:20:49] loved them. They so trusted them
[1:20:51] spiritually, naturally, in every way.
[1:20:54] And then they were betrayed. Not only
[1:20:56] merely betrayed, not a promise broken,
[1:20:58] but abused
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; and maybe led into into an area of their
[1:21:05] life where they were violated.
[1:21:08] literally violated
[1:21:11] and then come here so broken,
[1:21:15] so disrupt,
[1:21:18] so shattered that they hardly know their
[1:21:22] own name. I'm telling you, this
[1:21:24] congregation today, I know what I'm
[1:21:27] talking about.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; I've experienced this not once, not
[1:21:32] twice, but many times.
[1:21:35] What is the way out?
[1:21:38] Okay,
[1:21:39] now we'll sit down and we'll just find
[1:21:42] out who's to blame.
[1:21:45] It would never have worked.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Where's healing going to come from?
[1:21:50] Where's healing going to come from? I'm
[1:21:52] talking about people that have every
[1:21:53] reason in the world to lay blame and
[1:21:56] perhaps lay criminal charges.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Evidence, criminal charges could have
[1:22:02] been laid. But are we now going to do
[1:22:04] that? Are we going to get somewhere that
[1:22:06] we can justify or vindicate or bring
[1:22:09] penalty upon someone? Are we uh will
[1:22:12] will this suffice? Will this do
[1:22:15] something?
[1:22:16] Even if you brought criminal charges,
[1:22:18] even if a person was able to get uh uh
[1:22:20] some money or be repaid, is that going
[1:22:25] to do it?
[1:22:27] No.
[1:22:32] And they're here today. They're sitting
[1:22:34] in church today.
[1:22:40] What is the answer?
[1:22:49] The message has told me that I've been
[1:22:52] instructed by the message that Satan has
[1:22:55] access to the memory channel. Amen.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; I have been instructed by a prophet's
[1:23:01] message that that memory channel has to
[1:23:03] be blown out
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; And when that is blown out by the Holy
[1:23:12] Spirit, then and only then can God take
[1:23:15] control of it
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; and begin to bring a healing to that
[1:23:19] part of that person's life. He came. He
[1:23:22] said, "I have come to heal the
[1:23:25] brokenhearted, the shattered, the
[1:23:27] broken, the distraught,
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; the abused. I've come to heal them."
[1:23:40] And as time would go on
[1:23:43] and those things are never resurrected
[1:23:45] again, we look into the face
[1:23:49] of him.
[1:23:54] Knows me,
[1:23:56] knows where I've been,
[1:23:58] knows what's happened.
[1:24:01] He knows who's to fault.
[1:24:03] And I just come.
[1:24:05] I just come. I just give myself what is
[1:24:09] left of me. I give myself and I will
[1:24:12] believe that he can heal. I will believe
[1:24:17] that he can make
[1:24:19] out of me what he wants me to be.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; This scripture which is so beautiful.
[1:24:31] The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:24:34] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:24:36] the gospel to the poor. He has sent me
[1:24:39] to heal the brokenhearted,
[1:24:42] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:24:44] and recovering of sight to the blind,
[1:24:46] and to set at liberty them that are
[1:24:48] bruised. Two words here, brokenhearted
[1:24:52] and bruised. And if you look into them,
[1:24:56] you'll find that they're both very
[1:24:58] similar.
[1:25:02] Now, you might be saying, "Well, we're
[1:25:04] in the message and we're so far beyond
[1:25:06] that, and we're, you know, that's way
[1:25:10] past
[1:25:12] uh other part of our lives."
[1:25:16] Well, I'm just not too sure that that is
[1:25:18] the case because I see where those
[1:25:22] traits come up and they come up within
[1:25:24] the congregation. They come up within
[1:25:26] the body of Christ.
[1:25:28] And there's a certain there's a certain
[1:25:31] uh sequence that happens
[1:25:35] every once in a while and I recall some
[1:25:38] right now as I stand here. It's in my
[1:25:40] mind. I've been asked, "Brother Biscll,
[1:25:43] I hear that you do a certain thing."
[1:25:46] In this case, it was television. I hear
[1:25:49] that you have a television.
[1:25:51] I said, "Well, I have a monitor
[1:25:54] and I have
[1:25:56] uh I have cable in the house because
[1:25:58] they cable all the houses, but I'm not
[1:26:00] connected. I don't have it." Well, this
[1:26:03] person, they had a young person, a a
[1:26:05] teenager, wanted to know that. Well, I
[1:26:08] answer them even though I know right at
[1:26:10] the case that right at that moment
[1:26:11] they're playing the blame game
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; because they want to backslide
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; and they are trying to find
[1:26:19] justification for their own backsliding.
[1:26:22] I know that's exactly the case. They
[1:26:24] want to backslide. And so even though I
[1:26:27] answered it, I answered it just exactly.
[1:26:29] I said, "No, I don't do not." Did that
[1:26:33] make any difference? Not one bit.
[1:26:36] that young person went just the way they
[1:26:38] want. And I don't know if we ever saw
[1:26:40] them again. They've gone off into
[1:26:42] because that's what they want to do in
[1:26:44] the first place. But they were scanning
[1:26:45] the horizon to see who can I blame. What
[1:26:48] can I blame? I want to place some fault
[1:26:51] somewhere so that I will be excused to
[1:26:54] do the thing that I want to do. I want
[1:26:56] to let go of my standards. And so I'm
[1:26:59] trying to find some reason out there in
[1:27:01] the congregation.
[1:27:05] Sometimes I have young people and they
[1:27:07] they have something they have some fault
[1:27:09] or something. I uh my parents and my
[1:27:12] mother allows this or my father does
[1:27:14] that etc etc. Well, I don't I don't go
[1:27:17] into it to try to find out is that
[1:27:19] right? Is you mean to tell me they
[1:27:21] actually do that? Because in so doing
[1:27:24] the thing is what is the motive? What's
[1:27:26] the what's what what is the point? What
[1:27:29] is the what is the next step? Well, the
[1:27:31] next step is if the I if if they can uh
[1:27:34] if they can uh uh justify a certain
[1:27:37] degree of of fault someplace in some
[1:27:41] cases it is to relax their own or give
[1:27:45] themselves room to do something that is
[1:27:50] uh drawing aside, falling away or in
[1:27:54] plain Bible language backsliding.
[1:28:01] So what if they do?
[1:28:04] What what's the answer?
[1:28:07] What if that person does? Well, I see
[1:28:10] this young person in the church. Okay,
[1:28:12] fine. But what are you doing about it?
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; My wife does this, my husband does that.
[1:28:20] I'm I'm I'm bearing down on this because
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; I need to come down with a punchline at
[1:28:26] the end. So what if they do? So what if
[1:28:29] that is the case? So what if that did
[1:28:31] happen? So what if I was hated? So what
[1:28:34] if they were jealous about me? So what
[1:28:36] if they did lie about me? So what if
[1:28:37] they did say so what if I did spend time
[1:28:40] in prison over a lie? What if what
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Joseph was a perfect type of Christ
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; and Christ did not engage in that. And
[1:28:51] we stand here today. You're sitting
[1:28:53] there today. You'll sing songs. You'll
[1:28:55] rejoice. You clap your hands and say
[1:28:57] it's Christ in me.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; You say it's the word in flesh again.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Which word?
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; The word that condemns, the word that
[1:29:05] seeks to find fault. The word that seeks
[1:29:06] to find blame, to lay blame. What kind
[1:29:09] of word lays in us?
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; He knows nothing of that tactic.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; He knows nothing of that tactic. It's
[1:29:17] not in him. In fact, it's he took all
[1:29:19] the blame.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm going to be coming
[1:29:23] to. Amen.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Never said these things didn't happen.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; They have happened. They do happen. They
[1:29:32] will happen. They are happening.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; So here's the sequence.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Someone said, "Well, you know, here I
[1:29:41] found some fault. I found some blame."
[1:29:45] All right. The next thing is that
[1:29:48] releases them to go the direction they
[1:29:50] want to go anyway.
[1:29:54] And then
[1:29:56] I find that that then that that shifts
[1:29:58] to another degree. It shifts into
[1:30:00] another gear and then they find fault
[1:30:02] with maybe their parents
[1:30:08] and then that extends to from their
[1:30:11] parents then to the church and then
[1:30:15] extends on from the church to the pastor
[1:30:19] and then from the pastor really in the
[1:30:21] end it's against God
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; and that is the sequence
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; and it can start out with such a an
[1:30:29] impetismal thing.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Say that is so small but you watch it
[1:30:34] grow.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; You watch it grow.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Joseph and I keep going back to it
[1:30:44] because it's a perfect time.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Joseph could have it it could have
[1:30:47] started out. He could have said, "Well,
[1:30:49] do you remember when I had that dream?
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Do you remember when I had that dream?"
[1:30:56] And you fellas got so mad at me. Now,
[1:31:00] that was just a little household. That
[1:31:02] was just a little family affair. That's
[1:31:04] all it was. Look, look where it went.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Look where it went. Look what happened
[1:31:09] from there on. We just had this squabble
[1:31:12] in the house. I had this dream. I
[1:31:15] thought it was spiritual. You didn't
[1:31:17] think it was spiritual. I I I really
[1:31:19] appreciate it. You hated it
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; and you hated me for it.
[1:31:26] Now look where we are.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; But what would have happened
[1:31:34] if he didn't see
[1:31:39] that God was in ordering his life? Then
[1:31:43] you might sit here and say, "Oh yeah,
[1:31:45] but that's Joseph." No,
[1:31:49] he he he was on the other side of the
[1:31:51] cross and we're on this side of the
[1:31:52] cross. He was reflecting Christ there
[1:31:54] and you are reflecting Christ now.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; If we're not, why are we here? Why are
[1:31:59] we in this service? Why are we
[1:32:01] listening? Why are we professing the
[1:32:03] message? If we're not reflectors of
[1:32:05] Christ, and I'm trying to say this
[1:32:08] happens to be something this Christ,
[1:32:10] this son of man never engaged in. He
[1:32:14] doesn't know anything about the blame
[1:32:15] game cuz he didn't blame. He just said,
[1:32:17] "Forgive them. They don't even know what
[1:32:19] they're doing
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; at his most
[1:32:24] crushing
[1:32:26] moment
[1:32:28] suffering
[1:32:29] as he was."
[1:32:35] I said last week and I'd like to say
[1:32:38] again,
[1:32:39] there is no valid reason
[1:32:43] for a man or a woman or believer to give
[1:32:46] up their spiritual standard
[1:32:50] their convictions,
[1:32:52] their walk with God. There's no valid
[1:32:55] reason to turn from the things of God.
[1:32:59] You will never be able to justify that
[1:33:01] in the presence of God. When we stand
[1:33:03] there to give an account, we'll never be
[1:33:06] able to say, "Well, because this
[1:33:07] happened, it turned me better." God will
[1:33:09] say, "Is that all? Does that all a
[1:33:12] knowledge? And is that all a revelation
[1:33:13] you have of Calvary? That you had
[1:33:16] opportunity to become better? You had
[1:33:19] opportunity to to say slanderous things?
[1:33:22] You had opportunity to to go the
[1:33:24] direction you went?" Now, I'm glad
[1:33:27] you're here this morning, friends. I'm
[1:33:28] glad you're all here as believers. I'm
[1:33:30] glad you're hearing. I'm glad God has
[1:33:32] dealt with me about these things.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; So, there's no justification for a
[1:33:41] believer to be removed.
[1:33:45] Now,
[1:33:48] one of the things that happens, are you
[1:33:50] following me thus far?
[1:33:53] One of the things that happens
[1:33:56] is when an individual
[1:33:58] finds justification to relax, maybe not
[1:34:02] turn away from the message, oh, come to
[1:34:04] church, uh call brother, sister, all the
[1:34:07] rest of it, engage in in uh the
[1:34:10] activities perhaps of the of the body of
[1:34:12] Christ. But one of the things that
[1:34:14] happens if a person relaxes from their
[1:34:17] ferveny and from their stand with God is
[1:34:22] that you are not a unit to yourself.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; You affect somebody.
[1:34:30] And when and when we move back from our
[1:34:32] convictions, when we move back from our
[1:34:36] standards, when we move back from our
[1:34:38] devotion to God, when we simply cool
[1:34:42] off, cool down, and it becomes evident
[1:34:45] in our lives, in our in the way we
[1:34:47] conduct ourselves, perhaps in the way we
[1:34:50] speak or our attendance to the church
[1:34:52] and the body of Christ. We had time
[1:34:54] before, we don't have time now. and and
[1:34:57] and that affects somebody else.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says this, "Thou shalt
[1:35:04] not remove thy neighbors,
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; landmarks,
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; you will not affect. We are not
[1:35:15] permitted
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; in this oneness of the body of Christ.
[1:35:19] We are not permitted. No one
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. is permitted to live in such a way
[1:35:25] so that it it it it causes someone else
[1:35:28] to go the same direction and move their
[1:35:31] landmarks.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I am not permitted as a servant of
[1:35:35] Christ to live in such a way so it would
[1:35:38] cause the people or cause someone else
[1:35:41] to to loosen their standard up
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; even though it may not be sinful.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; There's no sin in fishing. I could go
[1:35:51] fishing tomorrow morning. I could fish
[1:35:53] the whole week. I could be fishing right
[1:35:56] up and then come home Saturday night and
[1:35:58] say, "Oh, yes. I got to, you know, you
[1:36:00] you think that that is a I'm just I I'm
[1:36:03] just making some uh a foolish example
[1:36:06] now." No, no, no, not at all. I stood
[1:36:09] right with the pastor in a study and his
[1:36:11] associate, he says, "My associate comes
[1:36:13] in here just a few minutes before
[1:36:14] service and says, "Oh, I I got to have
[1:36:17] something." and he's flipping through
[1:36:19] his Bible to have something to go out to
[1:36:21] say and he's really leaning upon the arm
[1:36:24] of flesh because perhaps he was gifted
[1:36:26] to speak in the first place and he just
[1:36:27] wanted to catch a little note of
[1:36:29] inspiration to go out and and give it to
[1:36:31] the people. I wouldn't be sinning if I
[1:36:33] fish right up to Saturday night. But
[1:36:35] I'll tell you what, I would be setting a
[1:36:37] standard that would cause somebody else
[1:36:39] to remove their landmark.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, our pastor does it. I
[1:36:44] can do it." and I'd removed their
[1:36:46] landmark,
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; the landmark of your inheritance in
[1:36:49] Christ.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're all called upon of God
[1:36:53] to live in such a way so that someone
[1:36:55] else should be able to look at you and
[1:36:58] and and be moved godward,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; not downward. We shall not remove our
[1:37:04] neighbors landmarks.
[1:37:07] So says the scripture.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not remove thy neighbors
[1:37:20] landmark which they have of old time
[1:37:23] have set in thine inheritance. It has to
[1:37:26] do with their inheritance. And listen,
[1:37:28] it goes stronger in Deuteronomy. It has
[1:37:30] said, "Cursed be he that removeth his
[1:37:34] neighbor's landmark." And all the
[1:37:37] people, the scripture says, "shall say,
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; And all the people shall say,
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; "Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's
[1:37:46] landmark."
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's called upon of us
[1:37:50] to live. You young men,
[1:37:53] you families,
[1:37:55] you mothers and fathers, you young
[1:37:58] ladies, we're all called upon of God to
[1:38:01] live in such a way so someone can look
[1:38:04] at you and say, "I would like to live
[1:38:06] that way.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; I would like to serve God that way. I
[1:38:09] would like to have that degree of
[1:38:11] devotion, that degree of dedication.
[1:38:13] They will look at you and be influenced
[1:38:15] God word
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; and all the people shall say,
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Amen.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; We shall not remove our neighbor's
[1:38:23] landmark.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; If someone wants to say, "Well,
[1:38:33] they do it."
[1:38:37] Even if that does happen, it's not
[1:38:40] justification for you or me to do it.
[1:38:48] Now
[1:38:51] the scripture says of Jesus
[1:38:56] who when he was reviled
[1:38:59] he reviled not again.
[1:39:02] When he suffered he threatened not but
[1:39:05] committed himself to him that judgeth
[1:39:08] righteously.
[1:39:11] When he was reviled he reviled not
[1:39:15] again.
[1:39:18] Now
[1:39:21] there's just two aspects of the actually
[1:39:24] the ministry of the word that I will
[1:39:27] just touch on very very briefly.
[1:39:30] Last Sunday we read out of Exodus 32
[1:39:34] where Moses was up on the mountain and
[1:39:36] the people were saying as for this Moses
[1:39:38] we don't know what happened to him. in
[1:39:40] fact is it it they were dismayed at it
[1:39:43] and the scripture in the Hebrew language
[1:39:45] simply puts it in this this is the this
[1:39:47] is the scenario. We don't know what's
[1:39:49] happened. Uh we're we're disappointed.
[1:39:52] We've been brought out here. We're
[1:39:53] embarrassed. Here we are out in this
[1:39:56] wilderness and and the man they said the
[1:39:58] man that led us out here not realizing
[1:40:01] that Moses had already told them the
[1:40:03] angel of the Lord is leading you. And
[1:40:05] right in this message, people say, "I I
[1:40:08] got something just here a few days ago
[1:40:10] came from overseas and and they start
[1:40:13] talking about the mess in the message."
[1:40:16] Well, it might be it might be by their
[1:40:19] assessment,
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; but I see a different kind of a message.
[1:40:22] I see a glorious message. I don't see
[1:40:25] any man that has led us out into this
[1:40:27] wilderness. I see the angel of the Lord
[1:40:30] that has led us and is leading us and
[1:40:32] shall continue to lead us. I see the
[1:40:35] bride of Jesus Christ has something that
[1:40:38] is glorious in his sight.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; And I see that she's being taught and
[1:40:43] instructed. I thought today, have to
[1:40:46] forgive me because I'm bouncing around a
[1:40:47] wee bit, but I thought today, where
[1:40:50] would we be? Where would you be? I want
[1:40:53] you to ask yourself that. If it was not
[1:40:56] for this son of man, Jesus Christ, in
[1:40:59] the form of this coming of the word, if
[1:41:01] he had not come to you in this day,
[1:41:04] where would you be?
[1:41:09] My wife and I were just hearing
[1:41:13] uh there was actually
[1:41:17] uh one of the churches downtown
[1:41:20] and it's named after Wesley the
[1:41:23] messenger. It's called the James Wesley
[1:41:27] or Wesley Church.
[1:41:30] It's a Anglican church, I believe, a
[1:41:32] church of England. And one of their
[1:41:34] ministers is leaving.
[1:41:37] So, in celebration of his leaving of the
[1:41:41] church, they're having uh they're having
[1:41:43] something for the community. I believe
[1:41:45] it's happening either this Sunday, maybe
[1:41:48] this afternoon or next Sunday. They're
[1:41:50] having a jazz fest. just everybody and
[1:41:54] anybody who can play jazz. Just the
[1:41:56] whole they're going to have some groups
[1:41:58] and so on so forth, but it's just kind
[1:42:00] of a uh and they said hang loose. Just
[1:42:03] anybody and everybody come in and and
[1:42:05] they're going to just have a jam session
[1:42:07] the whole afternoon. Anybody who wants
[1:42:09] to play, just come and jazz it up.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Well, that sounds so utterly foolish to
[1:42:17] us.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; But if you didn't have the strength of
[1:42:21] this word, If you didn't have the
[1:42:24] correction of this message, if we didn't
[1:42:26] have the instruction of this word, who
[1:42:29] knows where you'd be today.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Who knows what we believe it? That seems
[1:42:33] so uh it seems so impossible for us to
[1:42:36] even comprehend. But I can tell you that
[1:42:39] if we if this son of man had not come
[1:42:42] our way, and when he did, when this
[1:42:44] message came your way,
[1:42:48] did he say, "You were a rat.
[1:42:52] You were a scoundrel,
[1:42:55] did he? When he approached you, said,
[1:42:56] "You remember back there? Look, look
[1:42:58] what you wear.
[1:43:00] You're a no good nothing." And he had
[1:43:03] every reason to just really rub our
[1:43:06] faces down in our failures,
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; into our bondage. He had every reason to
[1:43:12] it. You rejected me. I called you. So,
[1:43:14] he could have said all kinds of things,
[1:43:16] but he never did do that. He never did
[1:43:19] do that because Christ does not engage
[1:43:22] in placing the blame. He places
[1:43:24] everything on delivering you from it.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; When you came to know Christ, when you
[1:43:32] came to know and and and if you have
[1:43:35] received a revelation, I'm talking about
[1:43:37] a divine revelation from God of what he
[1:43:40] has done in this generation. One thing
[1:43:42] is for sure, he never once pointed to
[1:43:45] your failures. Had he done so, you could
[1:43:49] not have come to a complete deliverance.
[1:43:52] He only showed you what he provided for
[1:43:55] you. He showed you. He came with such a
[1:43:57] glorious message, with such marvelous
[1:44:00] statements.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; You're quiet most of this service, and I
[1:44:08] think that's good. But I tell you, it
[1:44:12] would have been an unbearable experience
[1:44:15] if he'd have just started
[1:44:18] identifying
[1:44:20] our errors, our failures, our mistakes,
[1:44:24] and all that we did,
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; our defiled condition. He'd done that,
[1:44:31] we wouldn't have been able to even rise
[1:44:33] above it. Redemption and deliverance and
[1:44:37] healing does not come that way.
[1:44:42] Now, I hope you're catching the
[1:44:43] principle. If it didn't work for us to
[1:44:45] come to salvation, how is it going to
[1:44:48] work us in the body of Christ if we try
[1:44:50] to work on that principle of, you know,
[1:44:54] finding out where the problem, where the
[1:44:56] where the blame is to be. That isn't the
[1:44:58] way he works. The way he works is this
[1:45:01] is the way. Follow me. This is the way
[1:45:04] out. This is the way to healing. This is
[1:45:06] the way to deliverance. Hallelujah.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; The gospel has been presented to you
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; so that he can call you the blameless
[1:45:15] ones.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; A few more moments, please, and I'll
[1:45:27] close. 10 minutes I'm going to close.
[1:45:33] You remember
[1:45:36] Moses come to Aaron. He said, "What have
[1:45:39] you done?"
[1:45:41] And the Bible says, and here's the two
[1:45:43] things I was going to mention about the
[1:45:45] ministry. The Bible says
[1:45:47] that Moses, I touched on it Sunday,
[1:45:50] Moses saw the nakedness of the people
[1:45:53] and he saw how Aaron had made them
[1:45:56] naked. And it's it was not nakedness in
[1:45:58] the flesh at that time. It was a
[1:46:01] nakedness which simply means a
[1:46:03] relaxation that Aaron had relaxed from
[1:46:08] uh from the the instruction of the word.
[1:46:12] He had relaxed the word that the people
[1:46:14] were living under. In other words, he
[1:46:17] gave consent for them to do what they
[1:46:20] desired to do, which was something
[1:46:23] outside of the word of God.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; And that made their nakedness.
[1:46:29] I'll tell you what, in this day and age,
[1:46:32] uh there's some startling things.
[1:46:34] Brother Brandham, he talks about uh the
[1:46:38] fleshly nakedness of this generation.
[1:46:41] And uh
[1:46:43] I believe it was reported
[1:46:47] I don't get a newspaper by home, but I
[1:46:49] bought one. May sometimes I think God
[1:46:52] allows me to get get one and it just so
[1:46:55] confirms where we are today. and it
[1:46:58] talked about the nakedness of women.
[1:47:01] So this is just a this is just a
[1:47:03] newspaper in Vancouver and they said in
[1:47:06] the 1950s
[1:47:08] the women were showing 9%
[1:47:11] of their body flesh
[1:47:15] on the street and they were actually
[1:47:17] taking it by a certain event that has
[1:47:20] been taking place like something down in
[1:47:22] Hollywood I guess
[1:47:25] and they said then when it got up into
[1:47:28] uh the 60s there They were showing about
[1:47:32] 30%
[1:47:34] of their flesh
[1:47:36] and now it is between
[1:47:40] over 50%.
[1:47:43] actually have the statistics and I saved
[1:47:46] the whole article.
[1:47:48] And they said they and then they said
[1:47:51] there was a couple of movie stars that
[1:47:53] came out and they wore kind of long
[1:47:56] gracious gowns and and the degree went
[1:47:58] down because the you know the popularity
[1:48:01] thing then was to follow their uh uh
[1:48:05] their example and it went back down by
[1:48:08] about 10%. But now it has it's gone up
[1:48:11] to about 59%. And they said they figure
[1:48:14] in another few years that women will be
[1:48:16] showing up to 75% of their bodies naked
[1:48:22] on the street. And you see what a
[1:48:25] prophet said about that in the 1950s.
[1:48:28] And I can tell you what he was speaking
[1:48:30] from seeing what was happening on the
[1:48:32] street.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; He was seeing visibly what was happening
[1:48:35] down the street. So you can say, well,
[1:48:38] so you young men, you can never say,
[1:48:40] well, it's because there's naked flesh
[1:48:41] on the street. What God has given you in
[1:48:44] this message is greater than that naked
[1:48:47] flesh.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; What God has given us, what God has
[1:48:52] given us in this message is greater than
[1:48:56] your broken home.
[1:48:59] You young people with single parents,
[1:49:01] this message is greater
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; than the depravity that you've had being
[1:49:08] deprived of a father or mother. It's
[1:49:10] greater.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; It's greater.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; In the world, you may have been twisted
[1:49:16] all up and into a terrible kink, but
[1:49:18] under this message, this message came to
[1:49:21] heal the brokenhearted.
[1:49:27] You can say, "Oh, that's fine for you,
[1:49:28] Brother Biscll. I know what it is to not
[1:49:31] have a mother. I know what it is to go
[1:49:34] from pillar to post. I know what it is
[1:49:37] to live in homes as a child that didn't
[1:49:39] want me. I know what that is.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; I know what it is to be like the fifth
[1:49:44] wheel. I know what it is to be deprived
[1:49:47] of those things. But I also know what it
[1:49:49] is. That there's a Calvary and there's a
[1:49:52] healer that's greater than all of these
[1:49:54] disappointments.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; And the people said,
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; It's greater.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; It's greater. Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; You single parents that are here and
[1:50:10] have brought up your children the best
[1:50:12] you know how to serve God. I say God in
[1:50:16] heaven bless you abundantly. I pass this
[1:50:19] blessing on to you. Go forward.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Go upward.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Continue on.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; God is your reward.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Is Christ the answer? Is he the answer
[1:50:33] for all of it? That's great.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Are we not going to continue to have
[1:50:39] terrible disappointments? Yes, there
[1:50:41] will be. Satan will tear. He will seek
[1:50:44] to tear at the lives of individuals, at
[1:50:47] the lives of people. But I say he is is
[1:50:50] futile. It's an empty vain, futile
[1:50:53] effort on his part before the body of
[1:50:55] Jesus Christ.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:09] I want to kind of take five minutes on
[1:51:11] the last phase
[1:51:14] and that is taking all the blame.
[1:51:19] I had a couple come to me once
[1:51:22] and they met me at the back
[1:51:25] and they were very twisted up inside.
[1:51:27] They said we're we don't know how to
[1:51:30] act.
[1:51:32] You have invited
[1:51:35] uh a minister happened to be coming
[1:51:37] through and I said he'll speak in the
[1:51:39] evening service
[1:51:41] and they said this minister has treated
[1:51:43] us very very roughly.
[1:51:46] We were in his church and he has treated
[1:51:50] us very badly and we don't know how to
[1:51:54] act. We want to come to the service but
[1:51:56] we don't know how to act.
[1:51:59] And right away it may sound simple
[1:52:01] friends. It may sound simple but I tell
[1:52:03] you what it has stood this man in
[1:52:05] goodstead for a lot of years.
[1:52:08] I said right away, you'll get no place
[1:52:11] by saying, "Well, he said, and then when
[1:52:15] he said we did, and we did, and they
[1:52:18] did, and he did, and we said, and he
[1:52:21] said,
[1:52:23] I said, when we're all done, if we
[1:52:24] sorted that all out and laid the blame,
[1:52:27] and you took your part of the blame, and
[1:52:28] he took his part of the blame, what have
[1:52:30] we achieved?"
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Zero.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; A big fat zero.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; It will get you nowhere. a big fat zero.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; So I said, there's one answer that I
[1:52:42] have and it's for you to take
[1:52:46] 100%
[1:52:48] of the blame
[1:52:51] and they just looked at me.
[1:52:55] I said, "Listen, if you take 100% of the
[1:52:59] blame, that's step number one,
[1:53:02] and number two, I want you to go to him
[1:53:05] tonight, and I want you to say
[1:53:09] with all the honesty of your heart.
[1:53:14] We're sorry over what happened, and we
[1:53:18] are not here to discuss it.
[1:53:21] We're here to tell you
[1:53:23] and to ask you to forgive us. We take
[1:53:26] all the blame. I said, when you've gone
[1:53:29] to step two, what's he going to say?
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; As a Christian, he has to say, "Yes, I
[1:53:35] forgive you."
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; And number three, he has no place to go
[1:53:40] from there. Right. Amen.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; It is tutti
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; the end of the subject.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; It's all over and out.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; But someone said, "Well, what if we
[1:53:50] aren't to blame? Take it anyway."
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; I read about Joseph, didn't I?
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; I read about Joseph. Isn't that what he
[1:54:00] did? He said, "It's not your fault.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; It's not your fault.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; You didn't do it. You didn't send me
[1:54:07] here to Egypt. God sent me here
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; in the situation you are. Are you big
[1:54:14] enough? Is God big enough for you to say
[1:54:17] God permitted it or I would I am a child
[1:54:21] of God. I am a son of God. I'm a
[1:54:24] daughter of God. He saw every area of my
[1:54:26] life. He saw every step that I took. And
[1:54:29] God knows exactly where I sit right
[1:54:32] today. And I I I'm going to give him all
[1:54:35] the credit and all the glory and give
[1:54:37] Satan none.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; He took all the blame.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; In the spirit of Christ, he didn't just
[1:54:49] take it to go through an exercise. He
[1:54:51] didn't take it to condemn himself.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; He took all the blame.
[1:54:58] Maybe some of you wonder how in the
[1:55:00] world that would ever work.
[1:55:03] But it does work.
[1:55:07] Let me close in a couple of minutes. I'm
[1:55:09] just trying to close and I'm really
[1:55:10] shortening things up.
[1:55:15] You know,
[1:55:17] I started last Sunday with Adam and how
[1:55:21] they passed the buck. Brother said they
[1:55:23] passed the buck. Said, "Well, the woman
[1:55:24] that you gave me." But in the final
[1:55:27] analysis,
[1:55:29] in the final analysis, I'm going to read
[1:55:32] you a quote in a moment. You have to
[1:55:34] really think this one over. In the final
[1:55:36] analysis, there was something within
[1:55:39] Adam that was determined to assume
[1:55:43] responsibility for his wife. All the
[1:55:45] responsibility.
[1:55:48] All the responsibility. Brother Brandham
[1:55:51] says one place that when the serpent
[1:55:53] came and she was sown with that seed,
[1:55:58] he said Adam took her quickly to
[1:56:01] himself.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; He took her quickly to himself and swed
[1:56:06] her with the seed out of his body
[1:56:08] knowing that God couldn't destroy her
[1:56:11] when a part of him was now in her.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; He knew he came from God. He was a son
[1:56:16] of God and he put her and he took
[1:56:19] assumed full responsibility for her and
[1:56:21] took her quickly to himself.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Now here's what here's what the prophet
[1:56:28] said in Ephesians church age. Listen
[1:56:32] now, the word
[1:56:34] teaches us that if a woman leaves her
[1:56:36] husband and goes with another man, she's
[1:56:40] an adulteress and is no longer married
[1:56:43] and the husband is not to take her back.
[1:56:47] That word was true in Eden as it was
[1:56:51] true when Moses wrote it in the law.
[1:56:53] Now, do not take just a part of this
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; quote.
[1:56:59] It was true in Eden as it was true when
[1:57:02] Moses wrote the law. The word can't
[1:57:05] change.
[1:57:06] Adam took her back. They said, "Man,
[1:57:09] can't take her back." Says, "Adam took
[1:57:11] her back."
[1:57:13] He knew exactly what he was doing. But
[1:57:17] he did it anyway.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; She was a part of him.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; And he was willing to take her
[1:57:25] responsibility upon himself. Amen.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; He would not let her go.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; You see, it was a disastrous thing that
[1:57:37] took place, but he would not let her go.
[1:57:41] He said, "So Eve conceived by him." He
[1:57:45] knew she would. He knew exactly what
[1:57:49] would happen to the human race and he
[1:57:52] sold the human race into sin that he
[1:57:55] might have Eve for he loved her.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful powerful statement.
[1:58:02] Amen.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; But he took the thing that caused him to
[1:58:06] take her to himself
[1:58:10] and pregnant her was in taking her to
[1:58:15] himself, he preserved her.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; I hope you're spiritual enough to pinch
[1:58:27] your conscience. Now,
[1:58:30] this one that was the second Adam,
[1:58:36] he was Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago
[1:58:40] walking here.
[1:58:43] And he could say to a woman, "Neither do
[1:58:45] I condemn thee. Go and sin no more."
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; And all that they said, "Who sinned?
[1:58:51] This man or his parents?" He said, "No
[1:58:53] one." if they were all born in sin.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; But he was saying as far as approaching
[1:58:59] him, no one sinned, but that the name
[1:59:01] that God we may be glorified.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; And God is glorified in deliverance.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; God is glorified in in his healing
[1:59:11] power. I'm not talking about healing of
[1:59:13] the bodies now. I'm talking about
[1:59:14] healing in the in the realm that I'm
[1:59:16] speaking of today. And when this son of
[1:59:19] man, listen closely now. When this same
[1:59:23] Christ came through this generation
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; and begin to walk amongst the children
[1:59:31] of men
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; and found you,
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; in your pit,
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; found you in your death,
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; found you wallowing in your condition.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't even spend one moment
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; trying to decipher where you were. and
[1:59:51] the dark places you had been and the sin
[1:59:54] you engaged in and the rebellion in your
[1:59:57] heart and the hardness and the rejection
[1:59:59] and on and on and on. How he could have
[2:00:01] gone. He never even spent one instant.
[2:00:04] He said, "Come unto me. All ye that
[2:00:07] labor and are heavy laden and I will
[2:00:10] give you rest. Come unto me and you'll
[2:00:13] find deliverance."
[2:00:17] But if for a moment you try to f oh
[2:00:20] where my fault, their fault, my parents'
[2:00:24] fault, this one's fault, some
[2:00:25] preachers's fault, some church's fault,
[2:00:28] you stay where you are. But when you
[2:00:30] say, "I forgive all of that. I turn my
[2:00:33] back on that. I have now been I have now
[2:00:36] come into the very presence of the of
[2:00:39] God himself."
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; And when that son of man came to you,
[2:00:44] Amen.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; I look across this congregation
[2:00:50] and my mind races as I think the many
[2:00:53] places that you have been and how Satan
[2:00:58] has taken to tear and nash at our lives
[2:01:02] and to try to destroy us but he could
[2:01:05] not succeed.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; The greater one came.
[2:01:12] The greater one came
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; and he said, "I will take all the
[2:01:20] faults."
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will take all the pain. I
[2:01:26] will take all your nakedness. I will
[2:01:29] take all your failures. I will take it
[2:01:32] all. You bear none of it anymore.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; You have none of it.
[2:01:39] You may wonder why people rejoice. They
[2:01:41] rejoice because they experienced it.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; They rejoice because they know what I'm
[2:01:46] talking about.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; I take it all.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; I take it all.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Here's one standing here today.
[2:02:00] Even as I as a human, if I was a your
[2:02:03] friend, and a friend indeed, if I could
[2:02:05] take it all and send you out with a
[2:02:07] healed life. Oh, wouldn't I do that if I
[2:02:10] was a friend? But here's one that stands
[2:02:12] here today. It is the word of God made
[2:02:15] flesh again in the form of the son of
[2:02:19] man, Jesus Christ, in the second coming,
[2:02:22] letting the bride know, you never did it
[2:02:24] in the first place. And I take it all.
[2:02:29] I take it all,
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; all your shame,
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; all your failure and that of anyone else
[2:02:42] that was associated with your life.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Anyone else whose pathway
[2:02:50] whose footsteps cross yours,
[2:02:53] I take them.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:56] And by coming, friends,
[2:02:59] my dear ones in Christ, by coming to
[2:03:02] you, by coming to you,
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; listen, he was actually taking and
[2:03:10] putting his arms around you and pulling
[2:03:13] you to himself. Amen.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; And in that act,
[2:03:17] no fault, no blame,
[2:03:21] no shame because he was taking it all
[2:03:25] and he pulled you into himself and
[2:03:28] pregnantated you with the word of God.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; And you are saved.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; You are saved
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; for time and eternity. his very act of
[2:03:41] of coming to you and and the very act of
[2:03:44] Adam taking her to himself saved her.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; He did not try to lay blame or fault.
[2:03:53] And had he, we could never been healed.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; We could never have come to know what
[2:03:59] we've known.
[2:04:07] Maybe some of you
[2:04:10] God will deal with you.
[2:04:12] Maybe there's some of you
[2:04:18] and it'll have to be of God.
[2:04:21] There may be somebody here.
[2:04:27] You could only do so by the spirit of
[2:04:30] God.
[2:04:33] But you may be directed to go to someone
[2:04:38] say
[2:04:40] I don't know
[2:04:45] the grace that I've received
[2:04:47] I now give
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; and the things that have taken place
[2:04:54] they are now passed and before God
[2:04:59] who forgave Hey,
[2:05:02] I now take 100%
[2:05:06] of the blame
[2:05:09] in this blame game.
[2:05:13] To me, that is the most glorious
[2:05:18] thing
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; one came to you said, I will take it
[2:05:23] all.
[2:05:26] Satan would like to keep his toe in the
[2:05:29] door by saying, "Yeah, but you you were
[2:05:31] to blame. You did do some things. You
[2:05:33] did let you did you did you did and as
[2:05:35] long as you allow him that, it'll be you
[2:05:38] won't have a you won't have a complete
[2:05:40] deliverance."
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; But when you say it's over, it's
[2:05:44] finished and it's gone.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; I am delivered. I am forgiven.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Then you'll understand what these
[2:05:50] scriptures are all about when he says
[2:05:52] these things. Just listen to me now.
[2:06:00] that he might
[2:06:02] present
[2:06:05] it, the church, you the people to
[2:06:10] himself.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; A glorious church.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Say it. Glorious church.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Say it once again. A glorious church.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Not having spot or wrinkle.
[2:06:24] Satan would like to have you say, "I
[2:06:26] know I've got a lot of spots. I got a
[2:06:28] lot of wrinkles. I got a lot of
[2:06:30] failures. I got a lot of places where
[2:06:32] there should be some blame and I could
[2:06:34] be condemned over it." But our Lord
[2:06:36] Jesus Christ took that blame. He took
[2:06:40] that shame. He took your fault upon
[2:06:43] himself. And even if you might say, "I
[2:06:45] do have fault. I do have we have an area
[2:06:48] where I've allowed Satan to come into my
[2:06:50] life." Then God is offering you the
[2:06:52] opportunity to turn aside, slam the door
[2:06:54] on him.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; God has given us the opportunity.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; And he said to the spotless without spot
[2:07:05] or wrinkle or any such thing, but that
[2:07:07] it should be holy and without
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; blemish,
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; without blame, without blemish of any
[2:07:17] kind.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, what what is Christ going to
[2:07:23] do?
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Say, well, I brought a church. Yeah, 68
[2:07:27] million martyrs. Many of them were
[2:07:28] victorious and so on. They wouldn't deny
[2:07:30] the name of Christ. But when it come to
[2:07:31] Leodysia, didn't work.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Just didn't work. That old serpent that
[2:07:37] crawled in Eden, he just overpowered it
[2:07:39] again. Just deceived her again. A
[2:07:42] prophet came and declared under the
[2:07:44] vindication of God that this Eve, this
[2:07:46] bride cannot be deceived.
[2:07:49] [Applause]
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:54] Hallelujah.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; If you can't be deceived, it means you
[2:07:58] were made for the truth.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; You've been designed for the truth.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; And that's why all of those other things
[2:08:05] couldn't register with you. Your heart
[2:08:07] and soul could not say amen.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz you were made for the truth.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm trying to close.
[2:08:21] Brother Brandham is a musician's come.
[2:08:24] Brother Brandham,
[2:08:27] you've read about this, but I want to
[2:08:28] hear I want you to hear it in this
[2:08:29] context. All you young ladies, listen.
[2:08:32] Everyone listen. But she was a young
[2:08:34] woman
[2:08:38] and he went into an insane institution.
[2:08:42] He said the people were in their
[2:08:43] straight jackets and he knew he was
[2:08:46] there now to pray for a person
[2:08:50] and he came in and there was a beautiful
[2:08:53] young woman.
[2:08:55] She was sitting there
[2:08:58] and uh he said, "How do you do?" She
[2:09:02] said, "How do you do, Reverend Brand or
[2:09:05] Mr. Brham?"
[2:09:08] He said, "Uh, Brother Bam said, well, I
[2:09:11] don't really know where to start because
[2:09:13] you just in this big place. I don't know
[2:09:16] really where to start." And she says,
[2:09:18] "Well, how about starting with me?"
[2:09:21] He said, "You
[2:09:23] are you a patient here?" She said,
[2:09:25] "Yes."
[2:09:29] He said, "She was a beautiful young
[2:09:31] woman.
[2:09:32] would have made anybody
[2:09:35] a real fine sweetheart
[2:09:38] as a as a wife.
[2:09:44] And he said, "Well,"
[2:09:53] he said to her, "That's fine for the
[2:09:55] insane the situation they were in." She
[2:09:59] said, "That's what I am.
[2:10:03] And she said, "Would you listen to my
[2:10:05] story?"
[2:10:07] He said, "Certainly."
[2:10:11] I was about
[2:10:16] I was raised in a Christian home.
[2:10:19] Many of you young people,
[2:10:21] she was raised in a Christian home.
[2:10:24] I started going with a boy that smoked
[2:10:26] and drank.
[2:10:28] And one night there was a spiked drink
[2:10:31] given to her. Not exactly with something
[2:10:34] to knock her out, but with something
[2:10:36] that she didn't Well, he said it was
[2:10:38] something and then an immoral act.
[2:10:43] And she thought she'd throw her life
[2:10:45] away.
[2:10:48] She became an alcoholic.
[2:10:51] She became a prostitute.
[2:10:54] She was picked up and sent to the good
[2:10:57] shepherd's home.
[2:11:00] when she was only about 15 years old, a
[2:11:03] Catholic institution,
[2:11:05] she changed her religion from what she
[2:11:07] was to a Catholic.
[2:11:10] Came back out, thought she'd be all
[2:11:12] right. And the same thing happened
[2:11:13] again.
[2:11:16] Then she was picked up. She was getting
[2:11:18] of age then and sent and spent two years
[2:11:22] in the woman's penitentiary.
[2:11:25] And there they thought they had fixed it
[2:11:28] all right then
[2:11:30] and said when she came out she said the
[2:11:33] same thing again started right over
[2:11:37] again. And I said well now lady
[2:11:43] you're just trying to turn a new leaf.
[2:11:47] That won't work. So a new leaf won't
[2:11:50] work. Trying won't work.
[2:11:55] said, "I want to ask you something." He
[2:11:57] said, "Don't you and never expect to be
[2:11:59] married
[2:12:01] and a pretty woman like you and have a
[2:12:03] husband and babies like any normal
[2:12:06] woman?" And she said, "Yes, but who
[2:12:09] would have me?"
[2:12:12] She said, "What could I promise a man?"
[2:12:15] said, "I got a I get temper fits that
[2:12:18] I'd fight and swear and drink
[2:12:22] and said I get on a drunk and wouldn't
[2:12:25] come home for a month." Said, "What
[2:12:28] would a man want with a woman like me?"
[2:12:31] And I said, "He wouldn't."
[2:12:34] But I said, "Did you ever think that
[2:12:37] instead of being just something as a a
[2:12:40] school or turning over a new leaf or
[2:12:42] something, something could help you?"
[2:12:46] He said, "It's a devil."
[2:12:50] Now, the church couldn't help her.
[2:12:52] Religion couldn't help her. The
[2:12:55] penitentiary couldn't help her. The good
[2:12:57] shepherd's home couldn't help her.
[2:12:59] Turning over a new leaf couldn't help
[2:13:01] her. But now he's talking about
[2:13:03] something. Before he can talk about
[2:13:04] health, he has to talk about the
[2:13:06] problem. The problems is the devil.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; People today are tempted to say, "I'm a
[2:13:11] manic depressant." It's a devil.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; And today they've got all kinds of
[2:13:17] medications that give you only take you
[2:13:19] further away, make you reliant on some
[2:13:22] medication. It's a devil.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; You have to start where the problem is.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, here just take this
[2:13:30] pill or take that medication. take this.
[2:13:32] That's just that's not even turning over
[2:13:34] a new leaf.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Does this congregation say amen?
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Mr. Brandom,
[2:13:45] I've always believed that."
[2:13:48] She said, "And now they say I'm a
[2:13:51] delinquent person." And I said, "Don't
[2:13:54] believe it."
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, she never had anyone say that to her
[2:13:58] before. They say I'm delinquent. They
[2:14:01] say I'm insane. He said, "Don't believe
[2:14:03] it."
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; She could have said, "The walls tell me
[2:14:08] that." The people here tell me that. The
[2:14:11] people who got them in a in straight
[2:14:13] jackets, they they I've got a lot of
[2:14:15] evidence I'm insane. He don't believe
[2:14:18] it. It's the devil. Oh, I thank God for
[2:14:23] this glory of this wondrous way of the
[2:14:25] gospel. I thank God for the power of the
[2:14:28] cross of Jesus Christ.
[2:14:30] It has to start someplace. You don't
[2:14:32] believe it.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; They've told me this and they've told me
[2:14:37] that and I've been analyzed and I've
[2:14:39] been to this counselor and I've been to
[2:14:41] that pastor. I've been to this church,
[2:14:43] but I still have this thing. Number one,
[2:14:45] don't believe it.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; It's the devil.
[2:14:49] [Music]
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; You try to fix it and turn over new
[2:14:53] leaf, it won't work.
[2:14:59] said, 'I've always believed that. I
[2:15:00] said, 'n now, the only way, the only
[2:15:03] way, the only way to get rid of this
[2:15:07] devil is in prayer.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; It's not talking to somebody on the
[2:15:12] phone or sending somebody an email. It's
[2:15:15] by prayer.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; The only way to get rid of this devil is
[2:15:19] by prayer.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Does the congregation say, "Amen."
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; I want you to say it from the bottom of
[2:15:27] your bootstraps. Amen.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; This is the gospel of Jesus Christ. We
[2:15:31] are glorifying the cross of Christ.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm over my time by a long ways, but
[2:15:37] I'm going to throw the clock away.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; I feel the power of the Holy Spirit.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; God's going to bring victory.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Let's get down and pray."
[2:15:53] And there's been many times people got
[2:15:55] around here and prayed. And I prayed. I
[2:15:58] prayed earnestly while they didn't say a
[2:16:00] word and I knew in my heart no
[2:16:02] deliverance can come. They must pray.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; They must repent. I I can't repent for
[2:16:08] anybody. You can't repent for me. We
[2:16:11] repent for ourselves.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; And then deliverance comes.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; And she prayed.
[2:16:20] And she prayed there a while. I prayed
[2:16:23] with her. You'd think that would be
[2:16:26] sufficient for anything? And she looked
[2:16:28] up and she said, "Oh, Mr. Brandom, I
[2:16:32] believe I'm going out of here to be a
[2:16:35] different girl." And I said, "No,
[2:16:41] no,
[2:16:43] you're not. You're going out of here to
[2:16:45] be the same way you came in."
[2:16:50] See, you're just simply taking it on a
[2:16:54] mental conception.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; You're just feeling I can do it now. No.
[2:17:00] And this is where all kinds of people
[2:17:02] may be sitting right here. You've been
[2:17:04] to that spot.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, you just heard something that's so
[2:17:07] sturdy up. I'm going to be different.
[2:17:09] I'm going, I can never be the same. You
[2:17:11] go down the road a little ways a week or
[2:17:13] two and you're exactly the same.
[2:17:17] You know why? Number one, you didn't
[2:17:19] deal with it as being a devil.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; So, well, I'm just depressed or I'm just
[2:17:23] this or I'm something else. It's a
[2:17:25] devil.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; And you got to resist the devil.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Recognize it.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, my brother, my sisters,
[2:17:34] the word of God is sharper than any
[2:17:36] two-edged sword.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Some of you have had the same thing.
[2:17:39] You've had a repeat and a repeat and a
[2:17:41] repeat and a repeat. It's a devil that
[2:17:44] causes you to do that. Yeah, you got to
[2:17:46] get rid of him.
[2:17:47] [Music]
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; I just feel a spirit of warfare upon me.
[2:17:56] I want to go out and see. Are you
[2:17:57] delivered?
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Don't give any way to the devil.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; It's the devil that causes us to be less
[2:18:08] than what we ought to be in Christ.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; So, you're simply taking on a mental
[2:18:14] conception. And I said, "You've got to
[2:18:16] get down to business, sister, with God."
[2:18:20] And we got down and started praying. And
[2:18:23] after a while, she struck something.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Then she turned and the tears running
[2:18:29] down her cheeks out of them big brown
[2:18:31] eyes. And she said, "Brother Brandham,
[2:18:34] I'll never do that again." Oh, she found
[2:18:37] something then.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; She's married now.
[2:18:44] She's got two or three children. She's
[2:18:47] never drank from that day since. She's
[2:18:50] never smoked.
[2:18:52] See,
[2:18:54] something happened.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; He called that young man a modernday
[2:19:00] Judas.
[2:19:07] In context with the service,
[2:19:11] Brother Brandham had ample
[2:19:14] reason to start to counsel her. Well,
[2:19:17] you see, young woman, where it started,
[2:19:20] that's where you should have resisted,
[2:19:21] right back there. You should have never
[2:19:22] gone with that young man. He could have
[2:19:24] gone on and on and on.
[2:19:28] She'd been nothing but a dejected
[2:19:30] failure, abject failure.
[2:19:34] And he had every reason like Joseph had
[2:19:37] with his brethren. He could have pointed
[2:19:39] all of her sin and her trouble. She
[2:19:42] didn't need to hear about her failure.
[2:19:44] She needed to know there was a way out.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; She didn't need to hear this will
[2:19:49] probably just happen again. She needed
[2:19:51] to hear this will never happen again. Uh
[2:19:55] Christ is here.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:06] So glad
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; there was someone that took all the
[2:20:12] blame.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; A song has been going through my
[2:20:20] mind and I haven't even any voice left.
[2:20:27] Uh maybe we could take the microphone to
[2:20:30] my wife. You don't want to.
[2:20:32] Can you get a microphone? You know it.
[2:20:43] [Music]
[2:20:52] Can I have a microphone on those? I'd
[2:20:54] like one of those.
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:21:02] You made lots with your plates and lots
[2:21:04] of
[2:21:07] [Music]
[2:21:09] wait for a moment.
[2:21:11] [Music]
[2:21:17] It was his love for me
[2:21:23] that nailed him to the tree.
[2:21:27] [Music]
[2:21:29] to die in agony,
[2:21:32] [Music]
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; my sin.
[2:21:40] For my own guilt
[2:21:44] and pain, blame,
[2:21:46] the great redeemer came,
[2:21:52] willing to bear my shame.
[2:21:57] of all my sin.
[2:22:04] Oh, what a savior is mine.
[2:22:09] In him, God's mercies combined.
[2:22:14] His love will never decline.
[2:22:19] and he loves me
[2:22:26] to Calvar's hill. One day
[2:22:31] the Lord was led away.
[2:22:36] None else the price could pay
[2:22:41] for all my sin.
[2:22:47] He on the cross was slain.
[2:22:52] Yielding his life in pain,
[2:22:57] he felt the bitter stain
[2:23:02] of all my sin.
[2:23:06] The next verse.
[2:23:09] Was ever love so strong?
[2:23:12] [Music]
[2:23:14] Was ever crime so wrong?
[2:23:18] When Jesus
[2:23:20] suffered long
[2:23:23] for all my sin,
[2:23:28] he saw my greatest need,
[2:23:34] became my friend indeed.
[2:23:39] Through him I have been freed
[2:23:44] of all all my sin.
[2:23:48] Sing it with us. Oh, what a savior is
[2:23:53] mine.
[2:23:57] God's mercies combined.
[2:24:02] His love and ever decline.
[2:24:09] And he loves me.
[2:24:14] Why don't we stand and we'll sing it
[2:24:16] through. Brother Jason helping please.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; It was his love for me
[2:24:26] that nailed him to the tree
[2:24:32] to die in agony
[2:24:37] for all my sin.
[2:24:43] For my own guilt and blame,
[2:24:48] the great redeemer
[2:24:51] came,
[2:24:54] willing to bear the shame
[2:24:59] of all my sins.
[2:25:04] Oh, what a savior is mine.
[2:25:10] In him, God's mercies combined.
[2:25:17] His love can never decline.
[2:25:23] And he loves me
[2:25:30] to Calary's hill. One day
[2:25:35] the Lord was led away.
[2:25:41] None else a price could pay
[2:25:46] for all my sin.
[2:25:51] He on the cross was slain.
[2:25:57] Yielding his life in pain.
[2:26:02] He devel.
[2:26:04] [Music]
[2:26:12] Oh, what a what a savior is mine.
[2:26:17] [Music]
[2:26:18] In him, God's mercies come by
[2:26:24] and his love will never decline.
[2:26:30] and he loves me.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; I wonder while we're singing it if we
[2:26:37] can grasp
[2:26:39] the depth of that love.
[2:26:45] [Music]
[2:26:46] You can think of the worst and the
[2:26:48] darkest and the most horrible part of
[2:26:51] your past or your life and he loved you
[2:26:53] greater than that.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:56] You can think of your greatest failure
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; and he loved you more than that.
[2:27:02] He loved you more than that. He loved
[2:27:05] you beyond that. And that today, my
[2:27:08] brother, my sister, is our example.
[2:27:11] And I want to preach another service. It
[2:27:14] won't be on this subject, but it'll be
[2:27:16] extended from this subject. And it is
[2:27:18] this that we follow in his steps.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; As I have done, so do ye.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; As I have done,
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; you follow.
[2:27:32] And the people said
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; as he did as the example, you do it
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; and God will give you glorious,
[2:27:44] marvelous success in your spiritual
[2:27:47] walk.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; And the people said,
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; "I want to know that you believe it."
[2:27:52] Was
[2:27:55] [Music]
[2:27:57] ever love so strong?
[2:28:02] Was ever crime so wrong?
[2:28:07] And Jesus suffered long
[2:28:13] for all my sin.
[2:28:18] He saw my greatest need.
[2:28:23] He became my friend in need.
[2:28:29] Through him I have been free
[2:28:34] of all my sins.
[2:28:38] Sing it in victory now. Oh what a Savior
[2:28:42] is mine.
[2:28:46] In him God's mercies combine.
[2:28:52] His love will never decline.
[2:28:56] [Music]
[2:28:57] [Applause]
[2:28:58] And he loves me.
[2:29:04] Oh, what a savior is my
[2:29:11] in God's mercies.
[2:29:17] His love can never be.
[2:29:24] and he loves us free.
[2:29:30] We thank you matchless savior
[2:29:34] [Music]
[2:29:35] for this undying unchanging love
[2:29:40] and how you have spoken the word in such
[2:29:44] intensity in such strength to our
[2:29:47] individual hearts that we can have the
[2:29:50] absolute assurance and confidence that
[2:29:53] we lay before you blameless and without
[2:29:57] blemish. And in so confessing we lift up
[2:30:01] the power of the cross. We agree to the
[2:30:05] complete of the completeness of Calvary.
[2:30:08] We agree that that the words that you
[2:30:11] spoke it is finished indeed are true.
[2:30:14] That is done.
[2:30:18] Lord, as we are drawing to a close of
[2:30:21] this service
[2:30:23] and will depart this place,
[2:30:27] we'll return after a short time of rest
[2:30:29] and nourishment.
[2:30:32] I ask that your Holy Spirit will so
[2:30:37] take, oh God,
[2:30:39] the thoughts,
[2:30:41] take these things only as the Holy
[2:30:43] Spirit can speak them to the individual
[2:30:46] heart. Amen.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; And Lord, may each life be directed so
[2:30:51] sovereignly and guided by the Holy
[2:30:54] Spirit, oh God, in the thing that they
[2:30:57] should do
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; and the way that they should believe.
[2:31:01] And Lord, perhaps there it was a it was
[2:31:04] a very broad subject across a great
[2:31:07] scope of our our lives.
[2:31:11] Someone needs to say,
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; "It's the devil." Amen.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; And they need to deal with it in such a
[2:31:17] way.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Someone needs to say, "I take all the
[2:31:22] blame. I will take it all." And that way
[2:31:25] fellowship is restored. And that way no
[2:31:28] one has to try to seek to find where the
[2:31:32] fault lies. But I take all the blame, oh
[2:31:36] God. And someone needs to say, "I reject
[2:31:39] this condemnation that Satan tries to
[2:31:41] lay upon me. I reject it. This is not
[2:31:44] the plan of God. And someone needs to
[2:31:47] say, "I'm done with shifting this. I'm
[2:31:50] done with shifting this elsewhere, on
[2:31:53] someone else, on someplace else." Lord,
[2:31:57] I acknowledge my own failings and
[2:32:00] recognize what I heard this morning is
[2:32:02] my only answer, my only solution. And
[2:32:05] now I regard that you took it to
[2:32:08] Calvary. You took it all to Calvary, and
[2:32:11] I don't have to deal with it anymore.
[2:32:13] Amen.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, that you'll take the
[2:32:15] congregation this morning. I want to
[2:32:18] know while we're praying and our heads
[2:32:20] are bowed. Maybe you want to raise your
[2:32:22] hand and I identify. Say, I identify
[2:32:25] with a certain aspect of this service
[2:32:27] today. God knows. I know. I lift my hand
[2:32:30] and say, God, you take over. What I have
[2:32:34] tried doesn't work, but I want you to
[2:32:36] take over. I want you to take absolute
[2:32:39] control of my life and every dictate
[2:32:42] every part of it in the name of Jesus
[2:32:44] Christ. Lord, with hands raised, with
[2:32:47] hearts lifted up, with our faces looking
[2:32:50] heavenward, we are asking you to take
[2:32:54] charge of our lives. Oh God, we know and
[2:32:59] we have an absolute assurance that your
[2:33:02] undying
[2:33:04] caring for us and love for us will guide
[2:33:07] us through these waters of this age that
[2:33:09] we are in. Lord, I pray that you'll take
[2:33:12] the words now and let it be branded on
[2:33:16] our hearts for your glory and we'll give
[2:33:19] you all the praise in Jesus Christ's
[2:33:22] name.
[2:33:23] Amen.
[2:33:26] Hallelujah.
[2:33:28] I've been long longer than I wanted to
[2:33:31] be.
[2:33:34] So, I'm just going to dismiss you in the
[2:33:36] name of Jesus Christ. You've you've
[2:33:39] heard what you've heard. You've planted
[2:33:42] it deep in your heart. And I always find
[2:33:45] that God has a continuity of thought
[2:33:47] that he has a has a mind
[2:33:50] in this in the s services and the series
[2:33:53] that we've been having. And I believe
[2:33:55] that it's for us at this time.
[2:33:59] And
[2:34:01] if you just remember the very first
[2:34:02] quote I read, let us not go out and just
[2:34:07] be the same persons we were. Let it let
[2:34:10] the influence of the Holy Spirit
[2:34:13] make those changes that need to. It may
[2:34:17] not apply to everyone. If it doesn't
[2:34:18] apply to you, we're fine. But take those
[2:34:22] make those changes and say, "God, here I
[2:34:25] am. You take me and do what you would do
[2:34:27] with me. I'm I'm entirely surrendered to
[2:34:31] you." Amen. And the people said,
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed in
[2:34:36] Jesus name.
