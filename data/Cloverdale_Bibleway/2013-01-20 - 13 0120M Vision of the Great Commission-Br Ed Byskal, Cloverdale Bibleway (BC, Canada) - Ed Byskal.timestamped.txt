[22:47] Use my cup. [music]
[22:50] Fill it up and take me home. Oh,
[23:20] aside.
[23:22] I [music] separate
[23:26] for the Holy Ghost to pray through.
[23:30] [music]
[23:32] I wait for words
[23:36] to reach these [music] lips
[23:39] to set in motion
[23:43] [music] change.
[23:46] I have no way [music]
[23:50] by fleshly mind
[23:53] to know the glorious
[23:56] things he'll do. [music]
[24:00] I'm just set aside
[24:07] in [music] prayer.
[24:13] I abide [singing]
[24:15] Impossible,
[24:22] unthinkable, [music]
[24:25] amazing what God does. [music]
[24:30] He orchestrates
[24:33] all circumstance. [music]
[24:36] His ways are far above.
[24:40] [music]
[24:41] The winds of sovereignty
[24:45] now blow across the saint [music]
[24:49] that groans
[24:52] to convey the will of God on earth in
[24:58] [music] human hearts reborn.
[25:06] set aside.
[25:08] I [music]
[25:09] separate
[25:11] for the Holy Ghost [music] to pray
[25:13] through.
[25:16] I wait for words to [music] reach these
[25:20] lips to set in motion change.
[25:26] I have no way [music] my fleshly mind to
[25:32] know the glorious things [music] he'll
[25:36] do. I'm set aside
[25:42] in [music] prayer.
[25:48] I abide
[25:50] [music]
[25:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[26:10] [music]
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Faith gives forth [music] an utterance
[26:19] my eyes can't visualize.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; [music]
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Truth resounds
[26:27] within my frame. Though vile dark
[26:31] [music] forces lie,
[26:34] these stages of deliverance
[26:38] [music and singing]
[26:39] are seasons to refine.
[26:44] [music]
[26:45] Hardship molded voices
[26:49] confirmed by supernal
[26:52] signs.
[26:57] It's [music] the victory of submission
[27:02] [music] that releases the power of God.
[27:07] [music]
[27:08] A selfless realm untouched by man where
[27:12] he [music] reveals [singing]
[27:14] his will and plan.
[27:18] [music] A father's faith reached a prod
[27:24] [music] with the swine.
[27:28] Legion the demon bound a man till the
[27:33] son [music] of God restored his mind.
[27:37] For one lost lamb you gave the [music]
[27:40] 99 [singing]
[27:42] running
[27:45] seeking
[27:46] [music]
[27:47] pursuing
[27:51] to restore them one more time.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[27:59] &gt;&gt; I set [singing] aside
[28:01] the Holy Ghost to break through.
[28:06] I wait [music] for words to reach these
[28:10] lips [music] to set in motion change.
[28:16] I have no way by fleshly mind to know
[28:22] the glorious
[28:24] things he'll [music] do. I'm just set
[28:28] aside.
[28:30] [music]
[28:31] Lord, set aside. [music]
[28:37] Set aside.

[29:17] Amen. Set ourselves aside this morning
[29:20] for God to do what he wants with this
[29:22] service. Amen. Amen. As the Sunday
[29:24] school children are coming, maybe the
[29:26] brothers could just prepare to take up
[29:30] the morning offering.
[29:32] Amen. And as they're coming, why don't
[29:33] we sing in moments like these? I lift up
[29:36] my hands [music] and we have a
[29:40] car in the parking lot of Washington
[29:41] plate Volkswagen blue with your lights
[29:43] on 621. I think it's VWN. So if you
[29:47] drive a blue Volkswagen, you may want to
[29:49] make sure your lights [music] are turned
[29:51] off. Amen. We've got the power, but you
[29:54] might not have any power after the
[29:55] service if you don't [music] go turn
[29:56] your lights off. Amen. In moments like
[29:59] these, I sing out a song as the brothers
[30:01] would prepare for the offering. in
[30:03] moments [singing]
[30:05] like [music] these. Oh, I sing out
[30:09] [singing]
[30:10] a song.
[30:12] Yes, I sing out [music and singing]
[30:15] a song to Jesus.
[30:20] [singing]
[30:21] It's in [music] moments
[30:25] my
[30:27] [music and singing] lift up my hands.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:32] &gt;&gt; I lift [singing] up my hands to the
[30:36] Lord.
[30:38] We're [music] singing.
[30:44] [music]
[30:47] Oh, singing [music]
[30:51] [singing]
[30:53] to you, Lord.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:58] &gt;&gt; I
[31:00] love
[31:02] you.
[31:06] [music]
[31:11] [music]
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Doug, would you commence the
[31:14] blessing on the offering this morning?
[31:23] &gt;&gt; [music]
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're thankful this
[31:26] morning be able to be gathered in your
[31:28] presence where we've set aside this
[31:31] time, this day, Lord, to worship and to
[31:34] sing praises, [music] to get along with
[31:37] you, Lord, just to have you speak to us.
[31:40] Lord, you blessed us in many ways, Lord.
[31:43] You blessed us with freedom to [music]
[31:44] come and gather
[31:47] unashamed,
[31:49] unhindered, Lord, that others in this
[31:52] world don't have those freedoms. Lord,
[31:54] we're thankful for that. We're thankful,
[31:57] Lord, for the ministry that you've
[31:58] placed [music] here, Lord, to feed us,
[32:01] to bring us up a little higher, Lord.
[32:04] Lord, to be able to catch what you
[32:07] [music] would have for us,
[32:09] Lord. You blessed us in many ways. Lord,
[32:11] [music] as we return
[32:14] at this time, Lord, we pray that you
[32:16] would just take this offering that's
[32:18] about to be [music]
[32:20] uh gathered, Lord. We just pray that you
[32:23] would use it to the uses it's intended.
[32:26] Lord, I pray that you would bless it and
[32:28] multiply it, Lord. that your word would
[32:31] be spread throughout the world, needs be
[32:34] met,
[32:36] that you would use it as a blessing to
[32:38] someone else somewhere else. And Lord, I
[32:41] just pray that you just be with us the
[32:42] rest of this service. Again, as brother
[32:44] [music] Thomas prayed, that you'd bless
[32:46] Brother Biscll as he would come, Lord,
[32:49] that you would use him to bring to us
[32:51] what you would have for us. Pray you
[32:54] would take all distractions out of the
[32:55] way, Lord, as the enemy would come and
[32:58] try to make our minds wander.
[33:01] Think about [music] this afternoon or
[33:02] tomorrow or yesterday, Lord. That you
[33:06] would allow us that opportunity, Lord,
[33:08] just to get alone with you for a little
[33:10] while. That you would speak to us, Lord,
[33:13] minister to needs. And Lord, we just
[33:15] want to commit this day and this time
[33:17] [music] to you. That you'd be honored
[33:20] and glorified through it. We ask this
[33:22] now the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[33:24] Amen.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; In moment [singing]
[33:30] [music] like these.
[33:33] Oh, I [singing] sing out [music] a song.
[33:38] Oh, I sing out [singing]
[33:41] a love song
[33:43] to Jesus. [music]
[33:46] Oh, at moment
[33:50] like these, Lord, I lift up [music] my
[33:55] hands.
[33:57] I lift [singing] up my hands to [music]
[34:01] the Lord.
[34:04] Sing
[34:06] I [music]
[34:08] love you, Lord.
[34:13] Sing [music] I
[34:17] [singing] love you, Lord. [music]
[34:22] Sing
[34:23] I
[34:25] [singing]
[34:25] love
[34:27] you, [music]
[34:30] Lord.
[34:32] [singing]
[34:36] Singing I love [music] the Lord. Sing it
[34:40] [singing] out.
[34:42] I love
[34:44] you, Lord.
[34:46] [music] Oh, sing
[34:49] I
[34:51] love you, Lord. [music]
[34:55] or single
[35:02] you. [music]
[35:06] [singing]
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to invite [music] our
[35:14] brother Joel, sister Kim Ray to come
[35:16] have their baby dedicated. Turn the
[35:17] service to our brother Tom. Maybe as
[35:19] they come sing Jesus loves me. This I
[35:22] know. [music] Aren't you glad the Bible
[35:24] tells us that Jesus loves us? Amen. And
[35:26] he sent a messenger in this age to
[35:28] remind us once again just how much he
[35:30] loves us. [music] Amen. So we sing this
[35:32] as they come.
[35:35] [music]
[35:36] Oh [singing] Jesus
[35:39] loves me. This I know.
[35:43] Oh [music] for the Bible tells me so.
[35:49] And little ones who [music] belong.
[35:55] They are weak, but he is strong. [music]
[36:01] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[36:07] Yes, [music]
[36:08] Jesus loves me.
[36:12] Yes, [music]
[36:14] Jesus loves me.
[36:17] The Bible tells me [music] so.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; The reason why I asked Brother Ryan to
[36:26] sing that is because that was the first
[36:28] song I ever learned at church.
[36:31] And I can't imagine that uh parents that
[36:35] I had, lovely parents that they were,
[36:37] but they were they're they were the ones
[36:39] that dropped me off and never came to
[36:41] church. But I had the privilege of
[36:43] coming to church and learning Jesus
[36:47] loves me. Not realizing of course that
[36:50] there was a seed in me
[36:53] that God was drawing and that seed would
[36:56] bring forth other seed and they stand
[36:59] here today by the grace of God. We have
[37:03] Joel and
[37:06] Kimberly Ray standing here with her
[37:08] darling little daughter Stella Adon Ray.
[37:13] Brother Glenn is in the back smiling
[37:16] big mother is at home not well but
[37:19] she'll be streaming and watching this
[37:21] baby dedication.
[37:25] There's a scripture
[37:27] in the book of Revelation
[37:30] 2 and 28. The Bible says, "And I will
[37:32] give him the morning star."
[37:37] Well, Stella means star
[37:40] and her middle name is dawn.
[37:43] And brother Brandham said this. He said,
[37:44] "Jesus said himself, he that overcome
[37:48] will I give him the morning star." Joel
[37:54] Kim,
[37:56] these are personal promises
[37:58] that we can draw on ourselves.
[38:01] And we've overcome the wicked one. Joel,
[38:04] Sister Kim, you've overcome. And I've
[38:06] given you
[38:08] a star.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; I will give him the morning star. The
[38:14] Bible said, "What is it? Is an
[38:16] overcomer.
[38:19] One that has overcome the world.
[38:22] An overcomer of self. An overcomer of
[38:24] pride.
[38:26] I'll make him the morning star. And what
[38:29] will that do? I'll shine him up and set
[38:32] him up there.
[38:35] My oncoming power
[38:37] will reflect his own presence.
[38:40] Hallelujah.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; In darkness. And he that overcomes will
[38:44] I give the morning star.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Is the sun shining against it? It's
[38:50] reflecting the presence of the coming
[38:53] sun.
[38:56] Two people had to come to a place within
[38:58] their lives of overcoming
[39:02] for Christ to give them the morning
[39:04] star.
[39:06] And because of that great gift, God has
[39:09] given them a child. Stella, Don Ray,
[39:14] Stella,
[39:16] star dawn at the breaking of day. And I
[39:21] thought, how beautiful a name that is
[39:23] this morning. Because at the breaking of
[39:26] a new day, that bright morning star is
[39:28] going to shine. And I thought, Joel and
[39:32] Sister Kim, there was another woman in
[39:33] the Bible whose name meant star,
[39:36] and that was Esther.
[39:41] Esther didn't take the perfuming of the
[39:43] other women. She adorned herself with
[39:46] the modest apparel, the hidden man of
[39:48] the heart. The king would put the crown
[39:51] on her head. And that's what if God
[39:53] should terry that's what we want for
[39:55] this star for Stella that the king would
[39:59] put the crown on her head. Esther was a
[40:02] type of the church who was ready to come
[40:04] and adorn herself with the sweetness of
[40:07] the Holy Spirit. Not the perfuming and
[40:11] dressing of the world
[40:14] or try to compare with them. But she
[40:18] would adorn herself
[40:20] with that inner man.
[40:23] Naturally, parents
[40:26] want to give.
[40:29] They want to give, especially in this
[40:31] generation, things.
[40:35] But Joel and Kim,
[40:39] let her see Jesus.
[40:42] Let her see the gift of God within your
[40:44] life. That she could reflect then the
[40:47] Christ that you have. That her life
[40:49] would be a reflection both of Jesus
[40:54] and you.
[40:57] That's what we want. This little star to
[40:59] shine and reflect the lovely Lord Jesus
[41:02] and his grace. Amen.
[41:22] Lord, let the beauty of Jesus
[41:27] be not only seen but may it be reflected
[41:30] through this little bundle of life that
[41:32] you have blessed brother Joel and Sister
[41:34] Kim
[41:37] this little dedication morning.
[41:40] As your prophet said, the parents have
[41:42] come this morning to give back to God
[41:44] the gift that he gave them.
[41:47] And so I cradle in my arms, Lord, a
[41:49] little bundle of life. Her name is
[41:51] Stella Don Ray.
[41:54] God, may she reflect you at an early
[41:56] age.
[41:58] May she reflect the love of God, the
[42:01] grace of God, the mercies of God. May
[42:05] Lord God, she shine for the glory of
[42:09] God. Lord, every color of the covenant
[42:12] rainbow, may it be seen within her life.
[42:15] Would you crown her life, Lord, with
[42:18] health,
[42:20] strength, and the beauty, not of natural
[42:24] man, but the beauty of Christ. Bless
[42:27] this little child as brother Joel and
[42:30] sister Kim. Lord in this dedication
[42:32] morning give her back to you. May your
[42:35] hand ever rest upon her life. Bless her
[42:39] now in Jesus name. Amen.
[42:46] That is the first time she's looked at
[42:48] me and not cried.
[43:05] Amen. Was wondering if we should sing
[43:07] Joel's Army Comes in View, but we'll
[43:10] save that for maybe the third or fourth
[43:12] one, maybe. God bless you, Joel and Kim.
[43:15] Amen. Are you ready for the word this
[43:16] morning? Amen. Why don't we sing? We are
[43:20] standing on holy ground as we turn the
[43:21] service to our pastor. I'm [music]
[43:23] certainly looking forward to what we
[43:24] have this morning to hear from our Lord.
[43:26] Amen.
[43:27] Oh, we are standing. [music]
[43:34] Oh, a holy ground.
[43:38] [music]
[43:40] Oh, and I [singing] know that [music]
[43:44] there are angels
[43:48] all [singing]
[43:49] around.
[43:53] Oh, [music]
[43:57] [music and singing]
[44:00] Jesus.
[44:02] Now [music]
[44:06] we are standing
[44:09] in his [music] presence on holy
[44:14] ground. This morning we sing it again.
[44:17] Holy [singing]
[44:19] [music] sh
[44:24] [music]
[44:31] I
[44:33] [music]
[44:34] [singing]
[44:35] angels
[44:37] all around [music]
[44:42] and
[44:43] Praise
[44:46] [singing]
[44:48] Jesus. [music]
[44:50] Now
[44:54] we are standing [singing]
[44:56] [music]
[44:57] in his presence.
[45:01] [music]
[45:03] You're standing
[45:06] and we [singing]
[45:07] are
[45:11] [music] a holy
[45:13] ground
[45:18] and I know
[45:21] [music]
[45:22] might
[45:31] [music]
[45:37] [music]
[45:41] be our second [music]
[45:49] [music]
[45:52] Amen. Isn't it wonderful?
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wonderful to be in the
[45:57] house of God.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; And uh I I'm going to also have you
[46:03] stand with me if you would. I want to
[46:06] sing God rich in mercy.
[46:10] And I don't want you to sing it because
[46:12] the song leader is singing it or because
[46:15] I asked to sing it. I want you to sing
[46:19] it either for yourself,
[46:21] sing it for someone who's next to you,
[46:25] sing it for someone who's on the
[46:27] internet,
[46:29] sing it to the Lord.
[46:32] You are rich in mercy. [music] What
[46:34] would we do without that?
[46:37] And you may not feel such an urgent need
[46:40] of it at this moment, but he's worthy of
[46:42] all the praise. He's certainly worthy.
[46:45] And I just felt I I would like to say
[46:48] that to [music] you. Sing it for
[46:49] somebody. Sing it not because it's a
[46:52] chorus that we sung before, but sing it
[46:55] because it's the [music] truth of God's
[46:56] word. Hallelujah. God [music] rich in
[47:01] mercy. God rich in grace. Hallelujah.
[47:06] Gave us his son. Hallelujah. [music]
[47:09] All right, we'll sing it together just
[47:11] before we read.
[47:17] God rich in mercy.
[47:22] [music]
[47:25] We were undone.
[47:27] God rich in mercy.
[47:31] Oh [music] God in praise, God rich in
[47:35] love and [music] he
[47:39] from heaven
[47:42] to all
[47:45] [music]
[47:49] in mercy.
[47:52] [music]
[47:54] God is in mercy. Everyone once again.
[47:57] [music]
[47:58] Oh, God is mercy.
[48:03] God is [music] mercy.
[48:09] [music]
[48:12] God is in mercy.
[48:15] Hallelujah. [music]
[48:17] God is in praise. God is in love.
[48:22] Christmas from heaven [music]
[48:27] to all
[48:32] [music]
[48:34] mercy.
[48:37] [music]
[48:38] You are rich in mercy.
[48:43] And all of you say, "Praise the Lord."
[48:46] Hallelujah.
[48:48] Hallelujah.
[48:51] We'll just have a word of prayer.
[48:53] Father,
[48:54] we're opening your word, but no one can
[48:58] open it but you. You're the only one
[49:00] that can give us understanding. You're
[49:02] the only one that can send the author,
[49:04] the Holy Spirit that inspired the
[49:07] prophets of old and inspired, [music] oh
[49:10] God, those that ascribe the life of
[49:13] Jesus Christ. You you uh you established
[49:18] you guided their pen. [music] You guided
[49:20] their thoughts. And now Lord, come I
[49:22] pray as you have given us a message in
[49:25] this hour that reveals our Lord Jesus
[49:28] Christ. Be revealed. Lord, be made
[49:31] known. I pray, oh father, if there's any
[49:34] here that are a stranger to you, I pray
[49:36] that even in this service, they will be
[49:39] introduced to the son of the living God,
[49:42] the lamb of God. I revealed in this
[49:45] tower. I pray Lord Jesus you'll give uh
[49:48] give inspiration to the speaker and to
[49:51] all that may hear in the name of Jesus
[49:54] and may that name be lifted up and
[49:56] glorified. [music] Amen. Amen. God bless
[50:00] you. You wish to take your Bibles.
[50:02] [music]
[50:04] I want to say we're for my part we're
[50:07] having a wonderful year. We've just
[50:10] started. Brother John Andes
[50:13] uh started with a youth convention in
[50:15] Belgium and we thought that was
[50:17] wonderful. Uh we had real good report uh
[50:21] from the from that also brother David
[50:24] Iverson had had written and they were so
[50:27] very very happy with the meetings at
[50:30] that time.
[50:31] Uh we're living in a wonderful time with
[50:34] a wonderful
[50:35] uh message
[50:37] &gt;&gt; where God has reconfirmed the promises
[50:41] &gt;&gt; to all of us.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; And it's and really we're here this
[50:45] morning and I'm praying that God will in
[50:48] inspire the word in such a way so that
[50:51] we will uh just be able to obtain and
[50:55] apprehend more of it. That's my desire.
[50:59] Tonight we're going to have a baptismal
[51:01] as as well. It's wonderful to see uh
[51:04] young people being baptized. Uh Ella Joy
[51:08] is going to be baptized tonight. And
[51:10] I'll tell you what, she's 10, I think,
[51:13] going on about 15 mentally. She knows
[51:16] exactly
[51:18] uh why she want to be baptized. She want
[51:21] to I asked her what meeting it was. It
[51:24] was starting at camp last year. Who was
[51:27] speaking? She told me who was speaking
[51:29] and then a second one was someone else
[51:31] speaking. Brother Tim Andes was speaking
[51:34] in in uh at the devotion at school and
[51:37] that spoke to her and she just can't
[51:40] wait. Just can't wait. It's been it's
[51:42] it's wonderful when someone month after
[51:45] month, you know, just right onto their
[51:47] parents all the time. They know exactly
[51:50] why they want to be baptized. Praise the
[51:52] Lord.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:56] A group of our young people are planning
[51:59] to be going to Uganda for a working
[52:02] missions trip. I want to say to all of
[52:04] you, I don't know who all may be taking
[52:07] that trip. You want to be much in
[52:10] prayer.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; You want to say, "God, make me a
[52:12] blessing."
[52:14] &gt;&gt; And and cause my hands and my mind and
[52:17] my mouth to say what it ought to say and
[52:20] my hands to do what they ought to do and
[52:22] and and uh affect me. you can make one
[52:26] trip like that can affect you very very
[52:28] much. And so I pray that God will grant
[52:30] you. Brother uh brotherh Tim Dodd is
[52:33] going and brother Kim is going on behalf
[52:35] of the school and the young people. And
[52:38] so I believe that you'll be a blessing
[52:41] and we pray that you'll be a blessing.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to take your Bible,
[52:46] please turn to Mark the 16th chapter.
[52:52] I'm going to begin reading at the 15th
[52:54] verse
[52:56] and then we have a second reading which
[52:58] will be Acts 26.
[53:05] Mark 16 starting at verse 15.
[53:10] And he said unto them, "Go ye into all
[53:12] the world and preach the gospel to every
[53:14] creature. He that believeth and is
[53:17] baptized shall be saved, and he that
[53:19] believeth not shall be damned." And
[53:21] these signs shall follow them that
[53:23] believe in my name. Shall they cast out
[53:25] devils.
[53:27] They shall speak with new tongues. They
[53:30] they shall take up serpents, and if they
[53:33] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[53:35] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[53:39] sick, and they shall recover.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; So then, after the Lord had spoken unto
[53:45] them, he was received up into heaven and
[53:48] sat on the right hand of God.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[53:51] &gt;&gt; And they went forth and preached
[53:52] everywhere, the Lord working with them
[53:55] and confirming the word with signs
[53:58] following.
[54:00] Acts the 26th chapter, please.
[54:07] Paul is telling of his conversion
[54:12] 30 years later after it happened
[54:17] and he's telling it to King Agria
[54:20] and he even gives goes goes gives more
[54:23] detail here than he does in Acts the 9th
[54:26] chapter when the conversion happened.
[54:31] And when we were all fallen to the
[54:33] earth, Paul speaking, I heard a voice
[54:37] speaking unto me,
[54:39] and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul,
[54:42] Saul, why persecutest thou me?
[54:46] Excuse me. It is hard for thee to kick
[54:48] against the pricks.
[54:51] And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he
[54:54] said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
[54:57] But rise and stand up upon stand upon
[55:01] thy feet. For I have appeared unto thee
[55:03] for this purpose, to make thee a
[55:06] minister, and a witness, both of these
[55:08] things which thou hast seen, and of the
[55:11] things which things in and which I will
[55:14] appear unto thee, delivering thee from
[55:17] the people, and from the Gentiles unto
[55:21] whom now I send thee, and to open their
[55:24] eyes, and to turn them from darkness to
[55:27] light, and from the power of Satan unto
[55:29] God, that they may receive forgiveness
[55:32] of sins and inheritance among them which
[55:36] are sanctified by faith that is in me.
[55:40] Whereupon, O King Agria, I was not
[55:43] disobedient under the heavenly vision.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[56:04] I'm glad you're all here this morning.
[56:07] I am desiring and I will not stop until
[56:12] we see
[56:16] uh atmosphere within the congregation
[56:20] atmosphere of expectation.
[56:22] We don't want to just preach sermons.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; We want you to be able to receive what
[56:28] that what that benefit is, what it's
[56:31] spoken of. If it speaks of salvation, we
[56:34] want people delivered
[56:36] &gt;&gt; and born again.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; We got young people. We talk often about
[56:41] the young people, but there's many
[56:43] others in the church besides that. We
[56:45] want to see the our children and your
[56:49] children. We want to see them come to a
[56:52] knowledge of faith in Jesus Christ. And
[56:56] you are sitting here some no doubt this
[56:58] morning that you know in your heart
[57:01] you've not experienced that. You need to
[57:04] be not only born again but you need to
[57:07] be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; And so I don't put the so much the
[57:12] emphasis on what you have to do. I want
[57:15] you and your heart, this whole
[57:18] congregation to pray that the minister
[57:21] who stands behind the pullpit will be so
[57:24] directed of God to to create the
[57:28] atmosphere,
[57:30] &gt;&gt; the atmosphere in worship. I hear the
[57:32] prophet of God often when he comes to
[57:34] the end of a service he will he will
[57:37] even though he wasn't the world's best
[57:39] singer but he would sing songs and and
[57:42] and and invite the people to believe and
[57:46] uh uh I'm telling you even now perhaps a
[57:49] ahead of time but I believe that if
[57:51] there are those that are sick and we
[57:53] have those that are sick and afflicted
[57:56] from time to time friends this word is
[58:00] either true or untrue.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; And the truth of this word is that if we
[58:05] should pray and believe and speak the
[58:09] word that will inspire faith, you shall
[58:12] be healed.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; That is God's word.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; And we want to see that happen. If we
[58:19] need to lay hands on the sick, if we
[58:21] need to have a prayer line, we will do
[58:23] that and see that people are delivered
[58:26] and healed. We don't want to come to
[58:28] church to just become intellectually
[58:31] uh more aware of the message. We want to
[58:34] come to church to see this message
[58:36] living in the people.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; And that is what's very much on my
[58:40] heart. I I believe that that is exactly
[58:43] what we should be seeing. I want to uh I
[58:46] want to take from these scriptures
[58:50] and speak on
[58:52] uh I spoke another message almost the
[58:54] same title but I didn't even realize it
[58:57] until I was well into this service and I
[59:00] had intended on a completely different
[59:03] subject but God just kept in indexing me
[59:06] over the last two three weeks and I want
[59:08] to speak on the vision of the great
[59:11] commission
[59:13] and how we need to be absorbed
[59:17] &gt;&gt; in that vision. We need we need and when
[59:19] I say absorbed that is to become
[59:24] captivated.
[59:26] I tell you, you know, a person that
[59:28] doesn't have a vision in the world uh
[59:31] probably won't get very far. Might be,
[59:34] you know, quite aimless. But in one of
[59:37] the things that we seek to do with our
[59:40] youth and children and young people is
[59:43] to uh uh to encourage them in a certain
[59:47] direction and to get them focused. And
[59:50] then it's one thing to get focused but
[59:54] it's it's even more difficult to stay
[59:56] focused because we tend to become
[59:59] distracted or when we are focused on
[1:00:02] something it we'll run into obstacles or
[1:00:05] we'll run into difficulties and then we
[1:00:07] we tend to get distracted because uh we
[1:00:11] ran into we expect obstacles we expect
[1:00:14] hard times but that doesn't mean we give
[1:00:17] up
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; we continue and pursue on. And I can see
[1:00:20] in the scripture and we the scripture
[1:00:23] which we also read and concluded with
[1:00:26] where apostle Paul says whereupon I was
[1:00:30] not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
[1:00:34] 30 years later 30 years later he still
[1:00:38] was onto his commission. And I think of
[1:00:40] a couple of others just briefly to
[1:00:43] start. I think of Abraham. He was
[1:00:45] literally commissioned when he was told
[1:00:48] you will have a son and his and he's bar
[1:00:51] his wife is barren and he's not able to
[1:00:54] give uh uh seed to his wife that will
[1:00:57] produce a son but I'm going to give you
[1:01:00] a son and and and this son is going to
[1:01:03] inherit this land and and and that
[1:01:07] remained his vision
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; and he was he was obsessed with it even
[1:01:12] many years later he said I DON'T HAVE A
[1:01:14] SON TO INHERIT these things. All I have
[1:01:17] is my servant and you said you'll give
[1:01:20] me a son. That remained his the vision
[1:01:24] of his commission because he I believe
[1:01:27] he received as a commission I'm going to
[1:01:29] have this son. I think of Moses
[1:01:33] and the prophet how he spoke about when
[1:01:35] Moses came to the burning bush. The
[1:01:37] burning bush had what Moses lacked. And
[1:01:43] I can say to this congregation and all
[1:01:46] who will hear my voice, the message, the
[1:01:49] revelation of Jesus Christ has what this
[1:01:53] generation lacks. That's why God sent
[1:01:56] it.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to sit here and
[1:01:59] simply, you know, have a have a church
[1:02:02] service. We want to be absorbing,
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; absorbing,
[1:02:08] becoming captivated,
[1:02:10] fixated, becoming uh absolutely obsessed
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; with what this message came for.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; And the the objective of this message is
[1:02:20] to take a group of people beyond
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; the power of darkness and death
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; and to give us eternal life. That's the
[1:02:32] objective of this message. And I want to
[1:02:34] say in in the face of every demon of
[1:02:37] hell that shall take place
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; and we are part of that calling.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Abraham's commission, Moses, I think of
[1:02:50] Moses commission, and I'm not going to
[1:02:52] stay on those very long because I have a
[1:02:55] good uh amount that I want to cover. But
[1:02:59] even after Moses, there was uh Joshua
[1:03:03] and the prophets and then the apostles,
[1:03:06] the early church, the messengers.
[1:03:09] Friends, this gospel
[1:03:12] that we have received that we're so
[1:03:15] thankful. I'm so thankful that the
[1:03:17] messenger this hour didn't compromise.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; What if he would have accepted money,
[1:03:23] for example? What if he would have
[1:03:25] accepted popularity? You talk about
[1:03:27] someone who could have had it. He could
[1:03:29] have had all of that. But he would not
[1:03:31] compromise. He stayed true. And even
[1:03:34] when people begin to misunderstand and
[1:03:37] make accusations, he stayed absolutely
[1:03:40] true to his calling right from the
[1:03:42] beginning and years later. And and that
[1:03:46] to me is preaching the gospel to every
[1:03:48] creature.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Living the gospel. We may not be a
[1:03:53] preacher behind a pulpit but we are
[1:03:55] living a gospel. So I want to come to
[1:04:00] one one of the earlier messages and he
[1:04:03] reads this uh same scriptures and he
[1:04:07] says this message that was read to us
[1:04:10] this morning we would call it the great
[1:04:13] commission
[1:04:16] for it was the last commission our Lord
[1:04:19] gave his disciples to go into all world
[1:04:23] and to preach this glorious gospel.
[1:04:26] good tidings of the resurrection to all
[1:04:30] the world for a witness and then he
[1:04:32] would return and and that signs and
[1:04:35] wonders would accompany this message
[1:04:39] that was to be preached.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Preaching is not just vocalizing.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Preaching is not just saying some words.
[1:04:48] Preaching is a life that is lived.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Preaching is a life that is lived.
[1:04:55] you are preaching.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; You preached this last week.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; You may be preached to others that I
[1:05:02] will never speak to or these other
[1:05:04] ministers will never speak to, but you
[1:05:06] preached to them because the prophet
[1:05:09] said very, very clearly and I want you
[1:05:12] to stay very attentive this morning. I
[1:05:14] have a distance to go. He said that
[1:05:16] preaching is demonstrating.
[1:05:20] demonstrating
[1:05:21] is actually presenting something that's
[1:05:25] physically lived out. That's preaching.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Preaching the gospel. You we might say,
[1:05:31] well, there signs and wonders and all of
[1:05:33] these things and healings and so on that
[1:05:35] accompanies it. But the main the main
[1:05:38] power is that you have been changed from
[1:05:41] a person of darkness to a person of
[1:05:44] light. You have become the children of
[1:05:47] light
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; and not of the night but of the day.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; That is the gospel. And the very fact
[1:05:54] that you live every day and you walk the
[1:05:56] streets and you're in the stores and
[1:05:58] wherever more and you may think, "Oh, if
[1:06:01] I could only speak, you are speaking
[1:06:03] louder than words."
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; YOUR LIFE IS DECLARING IT.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ALSO, when God's provided
[1:06:18] healing for this generation, he said,
[1:06:20] "Every time a revival breaks out, any
[1:06:24] time in the Bible history or in the
[1:06:27] world's history, signs and wonders have
[1:06:30] accompanied the revival, God is in the
[1:06:33] camp."
[1:06:35] I I want to say if if this were some of
[1:06:37] my last words to this congregation, we
[1:06:40] should never come here to church without
[1:06:42] expectation of something to happen in
[1:06:45] the service.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Every service, every service, WE SHOULD
[1:06:50] SEE THE HAND OF GOD. GOD IS IN THE CAMP.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And when there's illness,
[1:06:57] WHEN THERE'S TROUBLE, WHEN THERE'S
[1:06:59] FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR OTHER KINDS OF
[1:07:01] DIFFICULTIES, GOD IS IN THE CAMP.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And for those that know that they have
[1:07:08] need of a deliverance, don't come
[1:07:10] expecting to walk out with it month in
[1:07:13] and month out. Expect to be delivered
[1:07:15] from it.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; But one of the most important things is
[1:07:18] when you have a spiritual need, and it
[1:07:21] is so IN THE SCRIPTURE. PEOPLE ASK
[1:07:24] SOMETIME WHY WE DON'T SEE you know signs
[1:07:26] and wonders and miracles so often
[1:07:29] because the people have not reached the
[1:07:32] point of desperation where they
[1:07:34] acknowledge even people I think of the
[1:07:37] the the man the de uh the demonpossessed
[1:07:42] one in the in the garden in the
[1:07:45] gatherines
[1:07:47] and Jesus said what is your name I'm
[1:07:50] just stepping ahead for just a moment
[1:07:52] what is your name said legion
[1:07:55] legion which is a thousand
[1:07:57] here's one I don't know whether he had a
[1:08:00] thousand demons or whatever but he was a
[1:08:03] wild madman oh amongst the tombs but God
[1:08:07] gave him sufficient reprieve to cry out
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; to Jesus
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; he gave him sufficient space AND THERE'S
[1:08:16] PEOPLE I FIND SO MANY PEOPLE are bound
[1:08:19] by one thing or another and maybe
[1:08:22] complexes or even hey there's nobody
[1:08:26] here that is immune to demon activity.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; It comes and bothers you. It comes and
[1:08:34] torments in your mind. IT TORMENTS SOME
[1:08:37] PEOPLE IN THEIR SLEEP. IT TORMENTS
[1:08:40] PEOPLE and he is a tormentor. AND SOME
[1:08:43] PEOPLE HAVE FEAR. SOME PEOPLE ARE BOUND
[1:08:45] WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS. YOU NEED TO BE
[1:08:47] FREE FROM THAT. And don't come to church
[1:08:50] packing it and go out expecting to pack
[1:08:53] it. YOU NEED TO BE FREE FROM THAT.
[1:08:56] HALLELUJAH. And when WE COME TO CHURCH,
[1:08:58] WE JUST SAY, "I'M SATAN HAS BEEN ON MY
[1:09:01] CASE THIS THIS WEEK. I'M COMING TO
[1:09:03] CHURCH AND I'M IN EXPECTATION.
[1:09:06] Either the preacher IS GOING TO SAY
[1:09:08] SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PRAY A
[1:09:10] PRAYER THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT, BUT
[1:09:12] GOD IS GOING TO WORK IN HIS BODY AND I'M
[1:09:15] GOING TO WALK OUT A FREE PERSON."
[1:09:18] AND THEN YOU START SEEING SOMETHING
[1:09:20] DIFFERENT BECAUSE PEOPLE COME WITH
[1:09:22] FAITH. THEY COME WITH EXPECTATION AND
[1:09:25] GOD WILL PULL IT OUT OF THE PREACHER.
[1:09:27] GOD WILL PULL IT OUT OF SOMEBODY WHO'S
[1:09:29] PRAYING. AND THEN YOU HAVE AND THEN YOU
[1:09:32] COME TO A SERVICE AND YOU CAN REJOICE AT
[1:09:34] THE NEXT MEETING. YOU SING DIFFERENT.
[1:09:37] YOU SAY, "GOD RICH IN MERCY. HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:40] I JUST GOT DELIVERED. GLORY TO GOD. This
[1:09:44] is A DIFFERENT MEETING. GOD'S IN THE
[1:09:46] CAMP.
[1:09:49] DON'T FORGET THAT, FRIENDS. THAT'S WHAT
[1:09:51] THIS CHURCH IS HERE FOR. THAT'S WHAT THE
[1:09:53] BUILDING is built for.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Then opened he their
[1:10:04] understanding." This was after the
[1:10:06] resurrection. Then opened he their
[1:10:09] understanding, that they might
[1:10:11] understand the scriptures, and said unto
[1:10:13] them, Thus it is written, and thus it
[1:10:16] behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise
[1:10:19] from the dead the third day, and that
[1:10:22] repentance and remission of sins should
[1:10:25] be preached in his name among all
[1:10:29] nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
[1:10:32] And Apostle Paul said, "For our gospel
[1:10:35] came not unto you in word only, but also
[1:10:37] in power and in the Holy Ghost and in
[1:10:41] much assurance as as you know what
[1:10:44] manner of men we were among you for your
[1:10:47] sake." So the gospel must come to you.
[1:10:50] It should it should give you uh such
[1:10:53] assurance.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; And you don't even have to you don't
[1:10:57] have to psych YOURSELF UP.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T have to try to build yourself
[1:11:01] up. You will be YOU'LL BE INSPIRED BY
[1:11:04] THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow, not next week, this week,
[1:11:09] this day, this service.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't if you just expect a a
[1:11:17] good service, that's what you get. But
[1:11:19] if you expect something to penetrate you
[1:11:22] and do something and build you up in the
[1:11:24] most holy faith and not and maybe not
[1:11:26] just for yourself, it might be for your
[1:11:28] family. It might be for someone else. It
[1:11:31] might be from a husband to a wife or a
[1:11:33] wife to her husband or whatever more or
[1:11:36] to affect uh I was thinking very much of
[1:11:38] the of the school and the and uh the
[1:11:41] right from looking for brother Terry the
[1:11:44] right from the principal and down
[1:11:46] through the teachers. YOU KNOW WHY THE
[1:11:49] SCHOOL is built? We didn't build a
[1:11:50] building to have a nice school for you
[1:11:53] students. We build a building so that
[1:11:55] you could be in an atmosphere and have
[1:11:57] Holy Ghost teachers and and COME OUT OF
[1:12:00] THERE, COME OUT of that school, young
[1:12:03] men AND YOUNG WOMEN WHO CONTINUE TO
[1:12:06] PREACH THE GOSPEL IN THEIR lives
[1:12:09] changed, transformed young men and women
[1:12:13] full of the Holy Ghost WHO PREACH THE
[1:12:15] GOSPEL EVERY DAY.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; AND THIS GOSPEL IS WITH POWER.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS POWER. THE FIRST GOSPEL,
[1:12:23] THE FIRST THING YOU EXPERIENCE IS POWER
[1:12:25] TO CHANGE YOU FROM AN ordinary average
[1:12:28] PERSON INTO ONE FULL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:12:32] THAT IS PREACHING AS YOU WALK DOWN THE
[1:12:34] STREET. PREACHING WHEN YOU go into the
[1:12:36] mall to shop. YOU'RE PREACHING ALL THE
[1:12:38] TIME. YOUR LIFE IS PREACHING.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:45] For the kingdom of God
[1:12:49] is not in word but in power for the
[1:12:53] kingdom of God. So the preaching of the
[1:12:56] word is the manifestation of the power
[1:12:59] of God. And that manifestation don't
[1:13:01] think it's now just you know praying for
[1:13:04] the sick and that kind of thing because
[1:13:06] that was the beginning. Uh I I will get
[1:13:08] to it in just a few moments. And the
[1:13:11] life of Jesus Christ was the very
[1:13:13] thoughts of God being lived out.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; The very the very life of Jesus, what he
[1:13:21] did and what he spoke was God's thoughts
[1:13:24] coming down to earth and being spoke and
[1:13:27] heard.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; And the and I may be asking for some
[1:13:33] participation in a moment.
[1:13:36] I'm expecting this service to be just
[1:13:37] somewhat different.
[1:13:40] And the angel speaking now announcing
[1:13:42] the birth of Jesus Christ. And she shall
[1:13:45] bring forth a son, and thou shalt call
[1:13:48] his name Jesus,
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; for he shall save his people from their
[1:13:53] sins.
[1:13:54] That's why he was called Jesus because
[1:13:57] even the word Jehovah's savior Jesus
[1:14:02] for. The reason he was called Jesus is
[1:14:05] for he shall save his people from their
[1:14:08] sins.
[1:14:10] The name of Jesus is spoken, I would
[1:14:14] say, hundreds of millions of times a
[1:14:16] day.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; But what God HEARS IS FOR HE SHALL SAVE
[1:14:21] HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; AND A PROPHET COMES and says the only
[1:14:25] sin is unbelief.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Only sin. That was the first sin. And
[1:14:30] that's still the only sin is unbelief.
[1:14:33] All these other things in the life you
[1:14:34] see that people are living, that's the
[1:14:36] attributes of unbelief. But there has to
[1:14:39] be a power to deliver us from unbelief.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; And when the name Jesus is spoken OR
[1:14:45] HEARD, GOD, ALL GOD KNOWS, HE SHALL SAVE
[1:14:49] HIS PEOPLE FROM their sins.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; I want the congregation to say those
[1:14:54] words. He shall save his people from
[1:14:57] their sins. Once again, alto together.
[1:14:59] He shall save his people from their
[1:15:02] sins. Now, I'm going to ask you at
[1:15:05] different times when I say the name
[1:15:07] Jesus, YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "HE SHALL
[1:15:10] SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM their sins."
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO SAY IT. JESUS.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; He shall save his people from their
[1:15:18] sins.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; GOOD. THIS ISN'T the rosary.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; This is truth.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM UNBELIEF.
[1:15:27] HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR
[1:15:30] SINS.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; There were men who needed healing, blind
[1:15:34] men or lepers, AND THEY SAID, "JESUS,
[1:15:38] THE SON OF DAVID, GOD HEARS, AND HE
[1:15:41] SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM UNBELIEF, AND
[1:15:44] THEY WERE GIVEN FAITH TO BE DELIVERED
[1:15:47] AND RECEIVE THEIR SIGHT AND were healed
[1:15:50] from God."
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:53] BY THE NAME OF JESUS, HE SHALL SAVE HIS
[1:15:56] PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS. You're going to
[1:15:59] hear me say it plenty of time, and I'm
[1:16:01] going to expect you to be saying it some
[1:16:03] of these times. And thou shalt save,
[1:16:07] thou shalt call his name Jesus. Every
[1:16:10] time that name is named or called a of
[1:16:14] God uh God hears a call, God hears for
[1:16:20] he knows what the meaning. The meaning
[1:16:22] came out of the mind of God sending an
[1:16:25] angel down and she shall bring forth a
[1:16:28] son and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
[1:16:32] And God's thought was he. This is my
[1:16:36] pool. This is my son. This is the
[1:16:39] instrument AND THROUGH HIM PEOPLE WILL
[1:16:42] COME TO BELIEVE.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THROUGH HIM I WILL TURN
[1:16:48] AROUND WHAT HAPPENED IN EDEN. AND THIS
[1:16:51] IS THE SECOND ADAM. HE SHALL NOT FALL
[1:16:53] LIKE THE FIRST ADAM. HE WILL NOT
[1:16:55] COMPROMISE. HE WILL NOT SURRENDER. AND
[1:16:58] HE WILL TAKE CAPTIVE THE FLESH AND TAKE
[1:17:01] IT TO THE CROSS AND RISE AGAIN OUT OF
[1:17:03] THE TOMB.
[1:17:05] HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM UNBELIEF.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY I START OUT
[1:17:11] TODAY. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR NEED MIGHT
[1:17:13] BE OR WHAT YOUR CONFLICT MIGHT BE OR
[1:17:16] WHAT YOUR PHYSICAL NEED MIGHT BE. HE'S
[1:17:18] GREATER THAN THAT.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER DOUBT YOU MIGHT HAVE. WELL, I'M
[1:17:23] YOUNG or I'm this or I'VE GOT OTHER I'VE
[1:17:26] GOT OTHER THINGS ON MY MIND. HE'S ABLE
[1:17:28] TO WASH THAT OUT. I'VE GOT SATAN
[1:17:31] BOTHERING ME WITH ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT
[1:17:34] SPIRITS AND ATTRACTIONS AND LUST AND
[1:17:36] WHATEVER MORE. HE'S STRONGER THAN THAT.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO COME INTO THESE DOORS
[1:17:40] EXPECTING TO WALK OUT FREE.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Whatever little feeling you might have,
[1:17:48] WHATEVER LITTLE ATTITUDE YOU MIGHT HAVE
[1:17:50] THAT'S NOT OF HIM, LET'S GET IT WASHED
[1:17:53] OUT.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; LET'S GET IT CLEANED OUT. HALLELUJAH. So
[1:17:57] we CAN COME INTO AN ATMOSPHERE. I tell
[1:18:00] you what, friends, when a when a when
[1:18:02] believers of this message come together
[1:18:04] in that kind of an attitude, IN THAT
[1:18:06] KIND OF AN ATMOSPHERE, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:18:08] SEE SUPERNATURAL THINGS TAKING PLACE ON
[1:18:11] A DAILY BASIS.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Whether a person recognizes it or not.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, his name is used
[1:18:33] in cursing."
[1:18:36] It works both ways.
[1:18:40] When it's used in cursing,
[1:18:43] the name still means the same.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; He shall save his people from their
[1:18:48] unbelief.
[1:18:50] HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SIN.
[1:18:53] AND PEOPLE ARE USING ALL KINDS OF
[1:18:54] DAMNABLE things and using the name of
[1:18:57] Jesus Christ. AND IT'S WALLING UP
[1:19:00] JUDGMENT against them.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; IN THE DAYS JESUS SAID, IN THE DAY WHEN
[1:19:07] THE SON of man will be revealed, it will
[1:19:09] be as it was in the days of Noah. And in
[1:19:12] the days of Noah, Noah was a preacher of
[1:19:15] righteousness, preached for 120 years.
[1:19:18] There was only eight people that
[1:19:22] believed unto going into the ark. And
[1:19:25] brother Brandham uses that example.
[1:19:27] THINK OF IT, FRIENDS. ONLY EIGHT.
[1:19:31] A MAN THAT WAS PERFECT in all of his
[1:19:34] ways as Noah was. And people didn't
[1:19:36] believe him. I wonder I wonder here if
[1:19:40] we could just ask ourselves the
[1:19:43] question. Would I be in or out?
[1:19:46] that we we as it was in the days of Noah
[1:19:50] SO SHALL IT BE IN THE DAYS and so
[1:19:53] there's two things that walled UP HERE
[1:19:55] TWO THINGS and brother Brandham says sin
[1:19:57] today HAS SO WALLED UP THIS WAS ACTUALLY
[1:19:59] WHAT I wanted to preach on and I'm just
[1:20:02] touching it and the and the people in
[1:20:04] THE DAYS OF NOAH they resisted they
[1:20:07] thought he was a madman THEY SAID THAT
[1:20:10] SCIENCE HAS PROVED THERE'S NO WATER UP
[1:20:13] THERE SCIENCE HAS PROVED THERE'S WHOLE
[1:20:16] CLOUD UP THERE.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT SCIENCE PROVES. WHAT
[1:20:23] GOD SAYS TO HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; AND IT WILL HAPPEN EXACTLY. AND
[1:20:30] FURTHERMORE, IT'S NOT JUST THE SIGN.
[1:20:32] IT'S THE VOICE THAT COMES AFTER THE
[1:20:35] SIGN.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:38] IT IS THE GOD THAT MANIFESTED HIMSELF
[1:20:40] AND WAS UNASHAMED TO STAND BESIDE THAT
[1:20:43] PROPHET OF GOD THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE
[1:20:46] LIFE FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END. AND
[1:20:49] HE COULD SAY NOT ONLY AT THE BEGINNING
[1:20:51] VERY EARLY IN HIS MINISTRY, BUT AT THE
[1:20:53] VERY END HE COULD SAY, "AND I WAS NOT
[1:20:55] DISOBEDIENT TO THE HEAVENLY VISION."
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; AND I'M PREACHING THIS CONGREGATION WHO
[1:21:01] SAYS THAT THEY BELIEVE IN THAT
[1:21:02] MESSENGER. IT'S BEING PASSED OFF TO US.
[1:21:05] IT'S PASSED OFF TO YOU SO THAT YOU MUST
[1:21:08] BE ABLE TO SAY, "NEITHER WAS I
[1:21:10] disobedient to the heavenly vision. GOD
[1:21:13] SPOKE TO ME. GOD DEALT WITH ME AND I
[1:21:17] STAYED ON TRACK."
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO ENERGIZE THE CONGREGATION
[1:21:26] BECAUSE SATAN IS WORKING HARD to derail
[1:21:29] you, TO GET YOUR MIND OCCUPIED WITH
[1:21:31] OTHER THINGS. Deny him. deny him in THE
[1:21:35] NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. HE SHALL SAVE HIS
[1:21:38] PEOPLE FROM UNBELIEF. IN THE NAME OF
[1:21:40] JESUS CHRIST,
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus,
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM UNBELIEF.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SOON AS YOU ARE SAVED FROM
[1:21:53] UNBELIEF, YOU WILL receive what you have
[1:21:56] need of. That's this gospel. And a
[1:21:59] prophet of this message could say, "And
[1:22:01] I was not disobedient to the heavenly
[1:22:03] vision."
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; HE STAYED ON TRACK, NOT FOR HIMSELF, FOR
[1:22:07] YOU.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU, for you, for you, for us.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; HOW WE THANK GOD. HE STAYED ON TRACK.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; What a sin. Says unbelief.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; How many knows that unbelief IS SIN? HE
[1:22:27] SAID THAT'S THE ONLY sin there is
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; is unbelief. He that believeth not is
[1:22:33] condemned
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; already. So the great commission is
[1:22:37] sending out the witness and testimony of
[1:22:42] the power of the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; That's not just a sermon now. That's
[1:22:49] power that is present right beside you,
[1:22:52] closer to you. You got to change your
[1:22:54] thinking. SAYING, "I'M NOT HERE TO
[1:22:56] DISBELIEVE. I'M NOT HERE TO QUESTION.
[1:22:59] I'M NOT HERE TO ALLOW SOME OTHER THING
[1:23:01] TO DISTRACT ME. I'M HERE TO REMAIN VERY
[1:23:04] FOCUSED. I'M HERE TO REMAIN ABSORBED.
[1:23:07] I'M HERE TO REMAIN ABSOLUTELY
[1:23:10] compassionate about this focus." And why
[1:23:14] did the prophet come? I WILL TELL YOU
[1:23:16] just a little later and quote from him.
[1:23:18] To call out a bride.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; He came TO CALL YOU OUT. HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; He came to take you in.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; HE CAME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO JESUS
[1:23:30] CHRIST.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; AND THIS JESUS CHRIST IS WHO I'M
[1:23:33] PREACHING THIS MORNING.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And he shall save his people
[1:23:38] FROM THEIR SINS. THAT'S WHY THE name
[1:23:40] came.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; For he shall save his people from
[1:23:45] unbelief and from their sin. Why? So
[1:23:49] then you can receive what you have need
[1:23:50] of.
[1:23:54] There's very few people today but what
[1:23:56] we have a need sitting in this service.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; And I'm PREACHING A SERVICE THAT YOU CAN
[1:24:01] GET WHAT YOU HAVE need of.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching A SERVICE THAT YOUR LIFE
[1:24:05] CAN BE CHANGED PERMANENTLY.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; This is NOT A HIGH AND then tomorrow we
[1:24:10] are back where WE WERE. NOT AT ALL.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; JESUS.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; This Jesus THAT WAS REVEALED. THAT'S WHY
[1:24:20] SATAN is roaring the way that he is
[1:24:23] BECAUSE HE HATES THIS REVELATION OF
[1:24:25] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:24:27] THIS IS THE SON OF MAN THAT WAS REVEALED
[1:24:30] AGAIN. THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND
[1:24:33] FOREVER. HE'S THE SAME THIS MORNING.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; And if YOU CAN JUST LET YOUR MIND LOOSE
[1:24:42] and cut ALL THE WORLD EARTHLY ANCHORS,
[1:24:45] you'll receive what you have need of.
[1:24:50] I'm not interested in a good service.
[1:24:52] I'm not interested in feeling good after
[1:24:54] I finish preaching. I'm interested in
[1:24:56] SEEING YOU RECEIVE WHAT you have need
[1:24:58] of. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE GOING
[1:25:01] TO BREAK THIS THING LOOSE, FRIENDS.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; The demonstration and manifestation of
[1:25:12] the gospel is displayed in many, many
[1:25:15] different ways. It's displayed in the
[1:25:19] life of an individual.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; It's displayed within a church.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; It's displayed in signs and wonders.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And resurrection power. IT'S DISPLAYED
[1:25:31] IN MANY different ways. It's displayed
[1:25:33] always in simplicity.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Where you think it's not being displayed
[1:25:40] and maybe you don't feel worthy or
[1:25:43] adequate, that's not the point. The
[1:25:46] point is what God has called you for a
[1:25:49] specific purpose and that is to manifest
[1:25:53] and show forth the power of Jesus
[1:25:56] Christ.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; For he shall save his people from their
[1:26:02] unbelief or from their sins.
[1:26:11] There were some men in Luke the 17th
[1:26:14] chapter and they said
[1:26:17] and they lifted up their voices. They
[1:26:19] weren't whispering.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; THEY LIFTED UP THEIR VOICES AND SAID,
[1:26:24] "JESUS,
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; have mercy on us."
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; And he gave them what THEY NEEDED. AND
[1:26:34] GOD HEARD, "AND HE SHALL SAVE HIS
[1:26:36] PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE MY PEOPLE. AND HE
[1:26:39] SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR
[1:26:41] UNBELIEF." AND UNBELIEF VANISHED AT the
[1:26:45] name of Jesus, and they received what
[1:26:47] they should get. HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; YOU AND I THAT ARE SO FAMILIAR WITH THE
[1:26:52] NAME, AND WE'VE HEARD IT IN ALL KINDS OF
[1:26:54] RELIGION, AND WE'VE HEARD IT IN SONGS BY
[1:26:57] PEOPLE, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
[1:26:59] TALKING ABOUT. WE'VE HEARD IT IN CURSING
[1:27:01] AND THEY'VE ONLY ARE WALLING UP. THEY'RE
[1:27:03] WALLING UP JUDGMENT.
[1:27:06] AND LISTEN FRIENDS, THEY'RE WALLING UP
[1:27:08] THE WATER. THE WATER THAT TOOK THE
[1:27:11] PEOPLE. AND THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND THEY
[1:27:13] KNEW NOT TILL THE FLOOD CAME AND CARRIED
[1:27:16] THEM ALL AWAY, BUT THEY WERE MOCKING THE
[1:27:20] MAN OF GOD."
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; AND THEY WERE LEANING TOWARDS SCIENCE
[1:27:25] AND ALL OF their uh uh intelligence and
[1:27:29] whatever. bore and they knew not. AND
[1:27:31] THE WATER THAT CAME WAS LITERALLY THE
[1:27:35] MATERIAL SUBSTANCE OF THEIR REJECTION.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Do I need to say that again? THEIR
[1:27:43] UNBELIEF PRODUCED THE WATER.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; THEIR UNBELIEF WALLED UP AND PRODUCED A
[1:27:49] FLOOD.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; AND THEIR UNBELIEF PRODUCED A FLOOD THAT
[1:27:54] TOOK NOAH TO A NEW WORLD.
[1:27:59] AND THE UNBELIEF OF THIS WORLD IS COMING
[1:28:02] WITH FIRE THIS TIME. AND THE FIRE IS
[1:28:04] GOING TO PURIFY EVERYTHING SO THAT YOU
[1:28:07] CAN RISE ABOVE THE JUDGMENT OF God and
[1:28:10] enter INTO A NEW WORLD. And that is more
[1:28:13] real than this world.
[1:28:16] THERE'LL BE NO CLEARCUT LOGGING ON THE
[1:28:19] OTHER SIDE. THERE'LL BE NO ALABAMA
[1:28:23] Alberta Aabascatar sands. There will be
[1:28:26] no oil polluting the oceans. THERE BE
[1:28:29] NOTHING IN THAT DIVINE PLACE. AND THE
[1:28:32] AUTHOR of this world has created a place
[1:28:35] for his ELECT AND FOR HIS CHILDREN WHO
[1:28:38] KNOW THE NAME OF JESUS AND RECEIVE JESUS
[1:28:42] CHRIST. FOR HE SHALL SAVE YOU FROM YOUR
[1:28:44] UNBELIEF SO YOU CAN REACH THAT PLACE.
[1:28:50] AND YOU'LL RISE ABOVE.
[1:28:53] WE MAY GET SICK AT WHAT WE HEAR in the
[1:28:56] world. We hear all this terrible demonic
[1:29:00] things, DASTARDLY THINGS THAT take place
[1:29:04] and it sickens our heart. Be encouraged.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; The flood that's GOING TO COME,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; THE FIRE THAT'S GOING TO COME GOING TO
[1:29:12] LIFT YOU RIGHT ABOVE IT BECAUSE YOU'RE
[1:29:15] IN THE ARK OF YOUR FAITH.
[1:29:18] THAT ALSO WILL BE NOAH and his people as
[1:29:21] it was in the days of Noah. Noah and his
[1:29:24] people GOT INTO A PHYSICAL ARK.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF HIS
[1:29:30] FAITH. HE PUT LEGS TO HIS FAITH. He put
[1:29:34] he used his muscles. He used his voice.
[1:29:37] HE USED HIS LIFE FOR 120 YEARS. DON'T
[1:29:40] LET ANY DON'T LET ANY DEVIL STOP YOU.
[1:29:46] Can you agree with me?
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, young man.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Rise.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; As Moses WOULD SAY, WHO STAND WITH ME?
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; WHO WILL TAKE UP THIS CHARGE? WHO WILL
[1:30:03] TAKE UP THIS MANTLE?
[1:30:05] Who will live this life? WHO WILL DENY
[1:30:08] THIS ENEMY?
[1:30:12] HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:14] DENY HIM. THAT'S ALL THAT'S ALL THE
[1:30:17] PROPHET SAID TO A HOMOSEXUAL. DENY HIM.
[1:30:21] Deny him. AND YOU'LL GO HOME AND BE A
[1:30:25] REAL GENTLEMAN AND BE A REAL MAN. THAT'S
[1:30:28] NOT MUCH OF A SERMON. I SAID JUST A FEW
[1:30:31] WORDS. BUT IT WAS IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:30:34] CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. YOU'LL BE A
[1:30:36] DIFFERENT PERSON.
[1:30:39] Oh my. Oh my.
[1:30:42] Oh my friends, THIS IS THE GOSPEL OF
[1:30:46] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:30:48] This is the gospel.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And if you don't know this Jesus Christ
[1:30:54] as you ought to know him, YOU JUST SAY,
[1:30:57] "LORD, I WANT TO RECEIVE what that man
[1:31:00] is speaking about and not tomorrow, but
[1:31:03] today, today, this morning, I must
[1:31:07] receive it."
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; I've asked him to come. I said, "Oh,
[1:31:12] God, I'm so homesick. I've seen these
[1:31:16] things happen. I'm not happy. I'm not
[1:31:20] I'm not satisfied just to get up and
[1:31:22] preach. I want to see the people receive
[1:31:24] it.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; I want to see them have what we're
[1:31:27] talking about. Not just reading about
[1:31:30] what the prophet did, but that what that
[1:31:32] prophet did is for the people now
[1:31:35] today."
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; You believe it's for you? Amen.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; You believe it's greater than your
[1:31:42] problem.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; And you may not even realize you have a
[1:31:46] problem, but he needs to come and show
[1:31:47] you you have a problem. And then you
[1:31:50] need to call.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; You can't just sit THERE AND WAIT FOR
[1:31:53] SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU NEED TO CALL.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; JESUS, HAVE MERCY ON ME.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; I can tell you natural blindness is a
[1:32:06] lot less than spiritual blindness. So, I
[1:32:08] don't see I don't see things. I don't
[1:32:10] understand things. You're the one that
[1:32:12] needs to say, "Jesus,
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; JESUS, FOR HE SHALL SAVE ME FROM MY
[1:32:17] UNBELIEF.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not able TO HAVE THE FAITH and the
[1:32:22] strength yet." YOU NEED TO CALL out to
[1:32:24] him.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; So, I'm done with this.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; I'm done with this thing. I'M NOT GOING
[1:32:31] TO HAVE this enemy
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; torment me anymore.
[1:32:36] Friends, we're not just talking about a
[1:32:38] message. People talk about the message
[1:32:39] pros and cons and all the rest of it.
[1:32:42] That message worked
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; from the beginning to the end.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; THE SUPERNATURAL
[1:32:50] GOD WHO WAS Jesus Christ himself in the
[1:32:53] form of a filler of fire was there at
[1:32:56] every service and did not MANIFEST
[1:32:59] HIMSELF BUT IN ALMOST EVERY service from
[1:33:01] the beginning of the ministry TO THE
[1:33:03] VERY END of the ministry.
[1:33:09] Hallelujah.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Well, I was struggling and I really had
[1:33:14] a struggle with this message.
[1:33:18] It's not easy.
[1:33:23] But while I was
[1:33:28] while I was studying, I came across this
[1:33:31] quote
[1:33:36] and it was from San Jose, California,
[1:33:41] very early in the ministry.
[1:33:45] Sorry, 19 1959.
[1:33:52] Brother Brandham said
[1:33:58] pillar of fire
[1:34:02] said said this pillar of fire
[1:34:05] isn't any more than 6 in from me
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; right at this time
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; and he had a woman standing in front of
[1:34:12] him
[1:34:14] the first woman
[1:34:17] and he said to her
[1:34:19] he said I'm watching he said the pillar
[1:34:21] fire is not 6 in from me. That's not
[1:34:24] back then. That same pillar of fire is
[1:34:26] right. If if if the other things he said
[1:34:27] are true, that's not 6 in from you.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about history now.
[1:34:34] We're talking about today. Nothing more
[1:34:37] current. And we're talking about
[1:34:38] tomorrow.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; If you have a hesit if you have a
[1:34:44] hesitation believing that, you need to
[1:34:45] say Jesus.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; JESUS.
[1:34:50] AND HEAR IT in the heavens that the
[1:34:52] Almighty God will say, "AND HE SHALL
[1:34:55] SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SIN.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR
[1:35:00] UNBELIEF BECAUSE THEY NEED TO RECEIVE
[1:35:03] WHAT I HAVE SENT TO THEM IN THIS HOUR."
[1:35:14] And he said, "I'm watching the light
[1:35:16] between me and the woman, and now it's
[1:35:19] breaking away."
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; And the woman suffers with TB.
[1:35:26] And she just come from a tubercular
[1:35:28] hospital.
[1:35:30] That's true.
[1:35:32] And there's somebody else. It's this boy
[1:35:36] here.
[1:35:37] Just a minute.
[1:35:39] There's the same spirit on him.
[1:35:43] Well, he said, "That's your grandson,"
[1:35:46] says to the woman. "That's right. And
[1:35:50] he's got sinus trouble." But he said he
[1:35:53] had the same thing she had.
[1:35:56] And he's also got scar tissue on his
[1:35:59] lung.
[1:36:01] That is true. All right, Mrs. Harris,
[1:36:06] that's your name. You and your grandson
[1:36:09] go home. Your troubles are over.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ makes you whole.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; I know a sister Harris has been coming.
[1:36:18] She's white-haired little lady coming to
[1:36:22] the meetings in Dallas, and I've talked
[1:36:25] about her grandsons.
[1:36:27] So, I thought of her. So I I just
[1:36:31] interrupted myself and I sent her an
[1:36:34] email very quickly
[1:36:36] and I just said to her, "Is that you?
[1:36:40] Were you in San Jose in Brother Ben's
[1:36:42] meeting?
[1:36:44] Was that you?" She wrote back. She said,
[1:36:47] "What a wonderful surprise to hear from
[1:36:49] you this morning." It was yesterday.
[1:36:53] No, this was not me. Brother Brandham
[1:36:56] was speaking to. It's a beautiful
[1:36:58] healing though. I have to tell you my
[1:37:01] story. So get ready.
[1:37:04] In 19 that's her just the way she is. In
[1:37:07] 1950 on gifts and callings or without
[1:37:10] repentance, you can hear brother
[1:37:12] Brandham speak to my daddy
[1:37:15] and daddy was healed of TV.
[1:37:18] Isn't that incredible?
[1:37:20] Same spirit.
[1:37:23] My daddy's name was Clifford
[1:37:25] Hearnsburgger.
[1:37:27] And you can hear them read it off of the
[1:37:30] card.
[1:37:32] The tape is not clear and on the and on
[1:37:35] the PDF it says sister, but that was my
[1:37:38] daddy he's speaking to.
[1:37:42] It is a long story as to know how we
[1:37:45] came to know about brother Brandham
[1:37:47] going to be in the meeting in Carlsbad,
[1:37:49] New Mexico.
[1:37:52] But no, it was ordered of God.
[1:37:55] My mom and I had just taken daddy to the
[1:37:58] VA hospital in Amarillo,
[1:38:01] Amarillo, Texas, a week before and they
[1:38:04] told us that he could not live more than
[1:38:06] two weeks.
[1:38:09] He was very ill. Anyway, brother
[1:38:12] Brandham told daddy he was healed and he
[1:38:15] lived for 14 years after that. I say in
[1:38:19] the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; he shall SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR
[1:38:23] unbelief in 2013.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In these meetings, AND YOU
[1:38:30] CAN ASSIST BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE AS A
[1:38:32] PREACHER OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST,
[1:38:36] NOT IN WORD ONLY, BUT IN POWER AND IN
[1:38:38] DEMONSTRATION OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; That's why I said, "God, rich in mercy."
[1:38:44] If you don't sing it for yourself, sing
[1:38:46] it for the one next to you. You don't
[1:38:47] sing it for the one next to you. Sing it
[1:38:49] for somebody on the internet. Sing it
[1:38:51] for somebody you're going to MEET NEXT
[1:38:52] WEEK. GOD RICH IN MERCY IN THE NAME OF
[1:38:56] JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S HOW HE GETS GLORY.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; We who know what his name is AND WHAT
[1:39:02] HIS NAME IS FOR. WE SPEAK HIS NAME
[1:39:05] BECAUSE WE EXPECT
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; THE power to follow it.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:15] And she said,
[1:39:18] "I had been I had been ill for a long
[1:39:21] time
[1:39:23] and I could not have children." Now,
[1:39:26] this is Citra Harris speaking.
[1:39:29] I had been ill for a long time and could
[1:39:31] not have children.
[1:39:34] According to the doctors, Brother
[1:39:36] Brandham was going to be in Lubach,
[1:39:39] Texas. A few months after that,
[1:39:43] my daddy and mama took me to the
[1:39:46] meeting.
[1:39:47] I did not get a prayer card and we knew
[1:39:51] we had to leave on Wednesday night.
[1:39:55] I was so disappointed. But brother
[1:39:57] Brandham called a prayer line
[1:40:00] instead,
[1:40:02] and I was in it.
[1:40:04] As he prayed for me, I held in my heart
[1:40:08] my desire for children. In the next
[1:40:12] year, God gave me twin girls. My mama
[1:40:15] always said that he gave me a double
[1:40:17] portion.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; I had to leave out a lot of details, but
[1:40:21] this is enough to give God the glory and
[1:40:24] praise for his goodness to me.
[1:40:27] Hallelujah. We can say glory to God.
[1:40:31] However you wish to say it. He shall
[1:40:33] save his people from their unbelief.
[1:40:36] Hallelujah.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you, BROTHER VICTOR. HE'S
[1:40:39] GREATER THAN every need.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; WHO WANTS TO BELIEVE WITH ME? HE'S
[1:40:44] GREATER THAN MY NEED.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; HE'S GREATER THAN MY FRIENDS NEED.
[1:40:50] HE'S GREATER THAN THE SITUATION IN MY
[1:40:52] HOME, IN MY FAMILY, WITH MY CHILDREN.
[1:40:56] HALLELUJAH. SOME OF YOU YOUNG PEOPLE
[1:40:59] NEED TO HAVE A NEW BIRTH. YOU KNOW IN
[1:41:02] YOUR HEART I NEED TO BE BORN AGAIN. YOU
[1:41:05] WANT TO SAY YOU'RE THE ONE THAT OUGHT TO
[1:41:06] STAND UP AND SAY, "JESUS, HAVE MERCY ON
[1:41:09] ME."
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; There's a LOT OF PEOPLE.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE whose minds are in
[1:41:18] darkness, but they HAVEN'T SAT IN THIS
[1:41:21] KIND OF A MEETING WITH THIS KIND OF AN
[1:41:23] ATMOSPHERE, WITH THIS KIND OF A PULL,
[1:41:25] WHICH I KNOW IT'S A PULL OF THE HOLY
[1:41:27] GHOST.
[1:41:31] You young people that go to the school,
[1:41:34] this is your my challenge to you. How I
[1:41:38] would thank God if I could have been in
[1:41:40] a school like that. HOW I WOULD THANK
[1:41:43] GOD IF I COULD HAVE HAD teachers like
[1:41:45] that.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; I mean it.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; I think about it all. I think about it
[1:41:52] often.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; I'm writing some of my memories and I
[1:41:57] think about it all the time. Cuz after
[1:41:59] right I was in a one room school. Grade
[1:42:02] 1 to grade 8. In another place I was in
[1:42:05] a one room school from grade 1 to grade
[1:42:07] 8. Had to walk four miles to school and
[1:42:11] four miles back. Go in the dark in the
[1:42:14] morning and come home in the dark in the
[1:42:16] evening. Tell you what, friends. But God
[1:42:19] had a plan.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; God had an agenda for THIS BOY.
[1:42:24] HALLELUJAH. GOD'S GOT AN AGENDA for you
[1:42:27] fellas. Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Will you say amen for me?
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; God has an agenda for you. What about
[1:42:33] you boys here? You believe God has a
[1:42:35] PLAN FOR YOU? WHY DON'T YOU RAISE YOUR
[1:42:37] HAND? SAY, "God has a plan for me." Do
[1:42:40] you believe that?
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Say with me, "Jesus."
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; I can't hand that.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Say it out loud.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Have mercy on me.
[1:43:00] Hallelujah.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, some of the young
[1:43:06] children that go to the baptismal tank,
[1:43:09] they've already had an experience with
[1:43:10] God, something that they will never
[1:43:12] forget.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; How many here have been baptized as
[1:43:15] children? Just as children, raise your
[1:43:18] hand high.
[1:43:20] You remember the day.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; You remember the time?
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; I do. And I remember when I was
[1:43:27] rebaptized,
[1:43:29] I was baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:43:31] Christ.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Didn't know what that name meant to the
[1:43:35] same degree this morning. But it's a
[1:43:38] name of power.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; This is not a sermon.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; This is to get directly to your own
[1:43:44] heart and soul.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And to SEE WHAT THE HOLY
[1:43:50] SPIRIT HAS IN MIND. You want to agree
[1:43:52] with ME AND SAY, "HOLY SPIRIT, WHATEVER
[1:43:54] YOU HAVE IN your mind, ALMIGHTY GOD,
[1:43:57] BRING IT INTO EFFECT.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; HERE I AM."
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; How many need healing that are in this
[1:44:06] building?
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; How many need healing?
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; How many need healing?
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; So this this is not a show. THAT HEALING
[1:44:14] IS ALREADY PAID FOR.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID IT IS FINISHED. AND WHEN HE
[1:44:19] SAID IT, IT IS YOUR SICKNESS, YOUR
[1:44:21] DISEASE, YOUR WEAKNESS, YOUR FRAILTY. IT
[1:44:25] IS FINISHED. I have paid the price.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; And it belongs to you.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; And if YOU NEED HANDS LAID ON YOU, WE'LL
[1:44:35] do so BECAUSE WE'RE INTENT THAT SATAN
[1:44:39] MUST LOOSE HIS HOLD.
[1:44:53] in invisible union.
[1:44:56] He said we all know that the modern
[1:44:58] church, now just notice as we take a
[1:45:01] little turn.
[1:45:03] We all know that the modern church in
[1:45:05] its present condition and its present
[1:45:07] state is in no condition. Listen close
[1:45:12] to finish the great commission that God
[1:45:16] gave the church. Now we're in 1964.
[1:45:20] We're many years down the road from when
[1:45:22] brother Brandham first said, "I was not
[1:45:25] disobedient to the heavenly vision. Now
[1:45:27] he's announcing the church and its
[1:45:30] condition." Something friends,
[1:45:34] some of you kids, you young people,
[1:45:36] maybe your parents were in those
[1:45:38] churches when a prophet screaming out
[1:45:40] and they didn't even know it. My parents
[1:45:43] were raised up in Catholic church.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; And many parents here, how many here
[1:45:52] were in some other kind of church and
[1:45:54] you weren't, you couldn't you some kind
[1:45:56] of other religion? Let me see your
[1:45:58] hands. Look at how many hands you're
[1:46:01] wondering. Were you looking for
[1:46:02] something?
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, of course you were looking for
[1:46:05] something. And while you're in that
[1:46:07] church, THIS PROPHET IS SAYING the
[1:46:09] church in its CONDITION CAN NEVER FINISH
[1:46:12] FINISH THE GREAT COMMISSION.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; AND NOW WHAT'S THE SECOND PART OF THAT?
[1:46:17] YOU AND I HAVE BEEN CALLED TO FINISH IT.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN CALLED. YOU CAN FEEL IT IN
[1:46:24] YOURSELF. YOU CAN FEEL IT WITHIN YOU.
[1:46:26] SOMETHING'S MOVING BECAUSE YOU'RE CALLED
[1:46:29] TO FINISH THIS GREAT COMMISSION.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; I told you, brother Timothy, I had a
[1:46:36] second part. I couldn't get to it
[1:46:39] before.
[1:46:41] I was visiting with brother Timothy and
[1:46:43] brother Oed and their wives and families
[1:46:45] last night. We got talking just about
[1:46:48] spiritual things for a moment. Brother
[1:46:51] Timothy Anookco said you you spoke a
[1:46:54] message on the great commission, the
[1:46:57] vision of the great commission. He said
[1:47:00] that was very deep.
[1:47:02] I said that's my that's my title
[1:47:04] tomorrow morning.
[1:47:06] I that's my title. So I don't want to go
[1:47:09] there. you know, we get inspired and but
[1:47:13] it was so heavy on my heart and I
[1:47:15] already I was so I have never never ever
[1:47:20] just come to where I begin to think of
[1:47:22] what was in God's mind
[1:47:25] you know Jesus he maintained his vision
[1:47:29] all the way even when his dear disciples
[1:47:31] wanted to prevent him FROM GOING TO THE
[1:47:34] CROSS he said
[1:47:37] how then will the scripture be fulfilled
[1:47:40] Listen friends, this gospel didn't come
[1:47:42] to us cheap. It didn't come you know in
[1:47:45] a modern 20th uh 21st century such as we
[1:47:49] are here this world and the prophet said
[1:47:52] the pressure of THIS AGE IS SOFT living
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; and and he said in a society that we're
[1:48:02] it's a neurotic society that we're not
[1:48:04] really meant for
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; and that's why YOU FEEL ALL TWISTED UP
[1:48:08] WHEN you're amongst in the world but
[1:48:10] this is where YOU CAN BE AT PEACE. IS
[1:48:13] WHERE you can breathe in THE HEAVENLY
[1:48:16] ATMOSPHERE, THE HOLY SPIRIT. BREATHE IT
[1:48:18] IN.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; You say, "I I don't feel it." I don't
[1:48:27] care what you feel.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to get you to feel
[1:48:30] anything. I'm just getting you to
[1:48:32] believe it.
[1:48:39] I want to say humbly,
[1:48:45] I meet and shake hands with a lot of you
[1:48:47] young people,
[1:48:50] I want you to know I know what your need
[1:48:52] is.
[1:48:56] Maybe you
[1:48:58] don't want me to know other ministers
[1:49:01] when they shake your hand because the
[1:49:03] word is a very revealing word
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; and you have it in you and you and it's
[1:49:10] you you don't say anything. You just
[1:49:13] shake hands. But I see that need and
[1:49:17] that's where the burden of the word of
[1:49:18] the Lord comes to. You don't want to see
[1:49:20] it just go on from one service to
[1:49:23] another to another, week in, week out,
[1:49:25] month in, month out. Because if that
[1:49:28] thing can takes control of your life,
[1:49:30] you find yourself outside of the company
[1:49:32] of the saints. That's the devil's plan.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm attacking that devil on the
[1:49:37] offensive this morning.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm trying to get you
[1:49:40] all to agree with me, mothers, fathers,
[1:49:42] the whole congregation, plus everybody
[1:49:45] on the internet to agree THAT'S THE
[1:49:47] DEVIL'S PLAN. AND WE INTEND TO DESTROY
[1:49:49] IT.
[1:50:00] There's people perhaps not in this
[1:50:01] service this morning ought to be here.
[1:50:04] They needed to be here. And Satan's
[1:50:06] already robbed them by not being in the
[1:50:09] service. They needed to hear this.
[1:50:22] Finish up.
[1:50:24] Now we come home. Finish up.
[1:50:28] You are called.
[1:50:32] You have been called by this message to
[1:50:34] finish up
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; the great commission. Amen.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; And the word finish here
[1:50:44] where Jesus has used it, he said, "It is
[1:50:47] finished."
[1:50:49] And he hung his head
[1:50:51] and gave UP THE GHOST. THE LAST WORDS,
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; "That God allowed to come from this
[1:50:59] vessel who he was dwelling in to
[1:51:01] reconcile the whole world to himself."
[1:51:03] The one was going to was now PAYING THE
[1:51:06] SUPREME PRICE FOR THE ENTIRE EARTH WHO
[1:51:09] WAS RECLAIMING IT.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; His last words,
[1:51:16] it
[1:51:17] is finished.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; And he hung his head and gave up the
[1:51:24] ghost.
[1:51:26] He died as men die.
[1:51:30] And they carried that body to the tomb,
[1:51:34] but it couldn't stay there. And the
[1:51:35] Bible says,
[1:51:37] if that same spirit
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; which raised Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:51:43] in you, it shall also it shall also
[1:51:47] liberate. It shall also raise up this
[1:51:51] body
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; by THE SPIRIT THAT DWELLS IN YOU. THIS
[1:51:54] MORTAL BODY, it shall raise it up. And
[1:51:57] we ARE CALLED TO FINISH. FINISH AND
[1:52:01] PROVE THAT THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO
[1:52:03] HAPPEN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S been
[1:52:04] spoken. And thus it shall be.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching, friends. I'm making
[1:52:14] some statements and then we'll soon be
[1:52:17] done, but I'm not done preaching.
[1:52:28] It was not so from the beginning. He
[1:52:30] said his last commission, the great
[1:52:34] commission to the church, go into all
[1:52:36] the world and preach the gospel. He that
[1:52:38] believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:52:40] saved. He that believeth not shall be
[1:52:42] damned, condemned, and these signs shall
[1:52:45] follow them that believe. He said,
[1:52:47] "Don't stop at the first equation or or
[1:52:50] quotation. You add and that's all." But
[1:52:53] he said, "It wasn't so from the
[1:52:55] beginning." Jesus said, "And these signs
[1:52:57] shall follow them that believe in my
[1:52:59] name."
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; I want to change your entire life by
[1:53:08] using that name.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; I want you girls to use it. I want you
[1:53:11] families to use it. And when you use it,
[1:53:14] I want you to think of what was in God's
[1:53:16] mind.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; If there's anything in my way now, as I
[1:53:23] use that name, if there's anything if
[1:53:25] there's any hindrance,
[1:53:28] it was sent.
[1:53:30] YOU WILL CALL HIS name Jesus for he
[1:53:36] shall not he hopes he will NOT HE'LL TRY
[1:53:41] HE SHALL DELIVER HIS people from their
[1:53:45] unbelief from their sin from their
[1:53:48] hindrance.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Don't forget this service.
[1:53:59] and in my name they shall cast out
[1:54:00] devils.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, if a spirit from hell
[1:54:09] is hounding you
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; and staying on your case and dragging
[1:54:14] you down
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; and maybe not possession, but
[1:54:17] oppression, oppressed by it,
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you, you are free in
[1:54:23] the name of Jesus Christ because I'm
[1:54:26] speaking to children of God. Hallelujah.
[1:54:29] And he shall SAVE HIS PEOPLE
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; FROM THEIR unbelief
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; so that YOU CAN BE FREE OF THAT THING.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; And they shall speak with new tongues.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; And if they take up serpents or drink
[1:54:44] any deadly thing, and you might say,
[1:54:47] well, deadly thing. Oh, you know, some
[1:54:49] somebody very foolish was drinking
[1:54:51] something uh poison. You drink poison
[1:54:54] almost every day.
[1:54:56] Contaminated things. and water and and
[1:54:59] whatever more.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Some of this stuff's killing people. You
[1:55:06] might say, "Well, how do I know?" Well,
[1:55:08] they die the death. People die the
[1:55:10] death,
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; and we don't know what took them.
[1:55:14] But there's some of you that are living
[1:55:16] that probably would have been dead by
[1:55:18] now.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Peter. We're
[1:55:22] happy you're here in the house of God.
[1:55:25] just had an operation, heart bypass, and
[1:55:28] came right to the church right after
[1:55:29] that.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the way it was at the
[1:55:33] beginning.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; And may we ever remain true
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; to the great commission."
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, here he is now. He's about 1959.
[1:55:41] He's gone about 10 years into it. And
[1:55:43] may we ever be true.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; I want to say, brother Brandham, you're
[1:55:49] called of God.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; You've gone across your reward. Amen.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Blessed Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; It's not it's not the man William
[1:55:59] Brandon that can be here but Jesus
[1:56:01] Christ can say where two or three are
[1:56:03] gathered.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; There I am.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; SAY THAT WITH ME. THERE I AM. Everybody
[1:56:10] say it. THERE I AM. IN THE MIDST OF
[1:56:13] THEM.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is between you and me.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST IS BETWEEN you and THE NEXT
[1:56:22] PERSON. JESUS CHRIST. HE'S GREATER THAN
[1:56:25] YOUR DOUBT.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; He's greater THAN YOUR WEAKNESS.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; HE'S GREATER THAN THE THING THAT
[1:56:31] TORMENTS YOUR MIND. YOU MUST ACCEPT IT.
[1:56:34] YOU MUST BELIEVE IT. AND YOU MUST SAY,
[1:56:37] "I'M FINISHED WITH THIS GUY."
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Holding the vision. I start out at the
[1:56:52] beginning trying to watch my time. I
[1:56:55] start out at the beginning saying
[1:56:56] getting focused
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; is difficult
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; but it's even more difficult to stay
[1:57:01] focused.
[1:57:02] Now he says now we're now he said we're
[1:57:06] further and holding the vision he said
[1:57:09] it's may we ever remain true to the
[1:57:12] great commission
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; in the beginning of the commission
[1:57:16] brother Brandham 1949 now please listen
[1:57:19] to the language I'm not going this is
[1:57:21] not historical this is a this is a
[1:57:22] message you've been called under this
[1:57:24] why you're sitting here
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; and I thought it was so nice the way he
[1:57:29] said now in these meetings
[1:57:32] I do not wish that anyone would be
[1:57:35] misinformed.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; I do not try to take the place of a
[1:57:39] medical doctor.
[1:57:42] This is not Mayo Clinic.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; This is the house of prayer.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; And incidentally,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; we're going to be opening up
[1:57:55] getting our rooms arranged and spoken
[1:57:58] with the brothers for prayer.
[1:58:01] And we want to have prayer. The prayer
[1:58:02] meeting is going to be different. Going
[1:58:04] to sing just a couple courses just to
[1:58:07] come into an atmosphere of prayer and
[1:58:09] then go right to prayer.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; And then when people are they don't have
[1:58:12] to have a a formal uh finishing or
[1:58:15] anything when you're done praying, you
[1:58:17] can get up and leave if you wish. And
[1:58:19] and that way you have prayer and a time
[1:58:22] of prayer. The church needs a time of
[1:58:25] prayer. And one of the night one night a
[1:58:27] month we'll have the prayer service on
[1:58:29] the US side so everyone can gather
[1:58:32] together and have prayer and that will
[1:58:34] be kind of the order of the service. Is
[1:58:36] that all right with everyone?
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; And he said we're not Mayo Clinic. We're
[1:58:41] a house of prayer. When medical doctors
[1:58:44] he said when medical doctors God put
[1:58:46] them here they're doing a good job but
[1:58:49] medical doctors don't claim to heal you.
[1:58:52] They claim to assist nature and with
[1:58:56] operations and surgeries and with
[1:58:59] medical remedies which is an aid to
[1:59:02] nature but nature has to do the healing
[1:59:05] and God uh and and nature is God. God is
[1:59:10] nature. Now he says but now but now I
[1:59:14] hope you're listening close. I'm sure
[1:59:16] you are. But now the time has come.
[1:59:23] Now you hear something. NOW IS THE TIME
[1:59:25] has come.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Until seemingly many things, the
[1:59:31] sickness is heaping on every side.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; And I wish to make this statement also
[1:59:38] that these things that I claim for
[1:59:40] praying for the sick, I do not claim to
[1:59:43] do one thing myself. I have no power
[1:59:46] within myself to do anything. I'm just a
[1:59:50] man, unlearned, uneducated, but but I'm
[1:59:54] sure that my testimony is right that
[1:59:57] truly a supernatural being
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; came to me
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; and made these statements
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; AND I WAS NOT DISOBEDIENT TO THE
[2:00:07] HEAVENLY VISION.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Aren't we gladise?
[2:00:16] You ought to turn your turn to somebody
[2:00:18] beside you
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; and shake their hand. Say, I'm so glad
[2:00:22] that he wasn't disobedient to the
[2:00:24] heavenly vision.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; And say that,
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he wasn't disobedient to the
[2:00:31] heavenly vision.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad, brother Tom. So glad. So
[2:00:38] glad, brother John, our prophet wasn't
[2:00:41] disobedient to the heavenly vision.
[2:00:44] Amen.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; And that's 1949.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Now we come to 1965.
[2:00:52] Said just about 6 months after that, he
[2:00:54] was now he's rehearsing
[2:00:57] way back. And he said, "I had my first
[2:00:59] baptism." So he's re referring back to
[2:01:01] the first baptism down here on the on
[2:01:04] the river when the light came down right
[2:01:07] there at Spring Street and a voice came
[2:01:10] from it and said as John the Baptist was
[2:01:13] sent to forerun the first coming of
[2:01:14] Christ. Your message will forun the
[2:01:18] second coming OF CHRIST AND WE'RE CAUGHT
[2:01:20] IN THE MIDST OF THAT COMING. We're
[2:01:23] caught in the midst of that event.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "This is 30 years later."
[2:01:30] Isn't it amazing? It was 30 years later
[2:01:33] when Apostle Paul stood up,
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; King Agria.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; I honor you AS A KING.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; BE IT KNOWN UNTO YOU
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; that this HAPPENED TO ME 30 YEARS AGO.
[2:01:47] AND HE SAID BACK THEN, I WASN'T
[2:01:49] DISOBEDIENT to the heavenly vision. And
[2:01:53] now we HAVE A MESSENGER SAID I WASN'T
[2:01:55] DISOBEDIENT TO THE HEAVENLY VISION WHEN
[2:01:58] HE SAID YOUR MESSAGE WILL FORRUN THE
[2:02:00] SECOND COMING OF CHRIST AND HE STARTED
[2:02:02] ON HIS WAY AND HE REMAINED FOCUSED
[2:02:05] focused focused the plane had trouble
[2:02:08] came down and in MEMPHIS HE JUST STAYED
[2:02:11] ON THE VISION I'm I'm I'm here to help
[2:02:14] the people and then he keeps walking
[2:02:17] that inner voice he told me about it
[2:02:19] just keep walking came to the edge of
[2:02:21] the sidewalk walk. Should he go this
[2:02:23] way, go that way? And he turned and he
[2:02:25] looked in the window of a story he told
[2:02:26] me. He said, "Just keep walking. Keep
[2:02:29] walking." He went back. There's a
[2:02:30] policeman. He just kept walking down the
[2:02:32] street. Got down to the poor end of
[2:02:34] town.
[2:02:36] There was a big heavy set colored woman
[2:02:40] leaning on the fence. She'd been there.
[2:02:42] Her clothes were damp from the morning
[2:02:45] dew.
[2:02:47] And he walks by her. She says, "Morning,
[2:02:50] Parson."
[2:02:52] He stopped.
[2:02:55] "Do you know me?" She said, "No." Said,
[2:02:56] "I don't know you." But she said,
[2:02:59] "You're supposed to be carrying a case.
[2:03:02] I saw you this morning in dream and you
[2:03:04] had a case."
[2:03:07] He said, "The case is back in the
[2:03:08] hotel."
[2:03:11] But I do have that case. Her son is
[2:03:14] dying. big tall young man dying on a bed
[2:03:19] going
[2:03:23] and she took him into the house. He said
[2:03:26] he never was in a place that he felt
[2:03:27] more of God. It was papered with
[2:03:31] newspapers
[2:03:34] and a little sign over the door. Now you
[2:03:36] have a prophet noticing what he notices.
[2:03:39] A little sign over the door said, "God
[2:03:41] bless our home."
[2:03:44] And here's this young man on a on a cot
[2:03:48] rolling back and forth.
[2:03:52] Oh,
[2:03:53] so dark in here.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; And she stood beside him.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Great big tall young guy about 21 years
[2:04:03] old.
[2:04:06] And it said a tear rolled down her cheek
[2:04:12] and she patted him
[2:04:15] said, "Mama's boy."
[2:04:17] Brother Brandham said to me, "Love is
[2:04:19] stronger than death."
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Love is stronger than anything.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; And he and Brother Brandon put his hands
[2:04:28] on the young man's feet. They were
[2:04:30] already cold. death had already started
[2:04:34] to move up his body.
[2:04:39] And he said to the woman, "Auntie,
[2:04:43] why don't you pray?"
[2:04:45] He said, "When she started to pray," he
[2:04:49] said, "I knew she had talked to him
[2:04:51] before."
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; She just talked to him. She knew. And
[2:04:55] she began to pour out her heart and said
[2:04:57] that now God gave her this son
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; and how he got amongst bad company
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; and he got an incurable disease
[2:05:06] from the life that he was living.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; God healed and brought him back from the
[2:05:12] jaws of death. And years later, brother
[2:05:15] Brandham saw him. He was working with on
[2:05:16] a train as a conductor or a helper on
[2:05:20] the train. And he met him there. And the
[2:05:23] boy recognized him come running up to
[2:05:25] him.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; What is it friends?
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; This is the same you. We might say, "Oh,
[2:05:31] how wonderful that power is.
[2:05:34] The power that has changed you
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; from darkness to light, from the world
[2:05:41] INTO THIS MESSAGE. THERE'S NO POWER LIKE
[2:05:44] THAT. THE CHURCH LONG AGO LOST THAT
[2:05:47] POWER.
[2:05:48] This isn't quit smoking or quit drinking
[2:05:51] or quit going to movies or quit this and
[2:05:53] not doing that on the internet or
[2:05:55] whatever more. It's more than that. IT
[2:05:58] CHANGES THE APPETITE. IT CHANGES THE
[2:06:01] MAN. IT CHANGES THE BOY. CHANGES THE
[2:06:03] GIRL OR THE WOMAN. YOU'RE CHANGED
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; BY THE power of the name of Jesus.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God, give me a voice. Oh,
[2:06:15] give me a voice.
[2:06:19] Amen.
[2:06:30] 30 years later
[2:06:33] and here I am still tonight proclaiming
[2:06:35] that message
[2:06:37] and around the world it's went. Amen.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Said, "I'm glad to be back in my
[2:06:43] hometown."
[2:06:45] And then he said at the end of that
[2:06:46] paragraph, "Now I have a message that
[2:06:49] I'm responsible for." When the message
[2:06:52] first started out, it was of course
[2:06:55] everybody was praying for the sick.
[2:06:57] Great signs and wonders and miracles
[2:06:59] that started, especially in the
[2:07:01] Pentecostal people, a universal revival
[2:07:04] of a healing campaigns that swept the
[2:07:06] world. For 15 solid years, there's been
[2:07:09] revival on every hill there is. And I
[2:07:13] suppose revival fires are burning.
[2:07:15] Literally millions, listen to this now.
[2:07:18] Literally millions have accepted Christ
[2:07:21] as their savior by that one commission.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; I felt the call of God as a young man.
[2:07:35] But the message I have today is because
[2:07:37] of this one commission. Your message
[2:07:41] shall forerun the second coming of Jesus
[2:07:43] Christ.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I mean? Are you
[2:07:48] following me?
[2:07:50] Are you saying are you saying brother
[2:07:51] Biscell that all these men that have
[2:07:53] preached
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; and so on so forth then we got to
[2:07:56] confuse God
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; the success and the ones that are being
[2:08:00] swept into the kingdom of God is because
[2:08:03] this event happened
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; and your message shall forrun the second
[2:08:08] coming of Jesus Christ and it and that's
[2:08:11] the beginning of it
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; he says and now it's hard to get in a
[2:08:18] church for sponsorship isn't Isn't that
[2:08:19] incredible? That kind of ministry and
[2:08:22] millions saved and revival started. He
[2:08:26] didn't only say that. Professor Harold
[2:08:28] says that.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Professor Harold who flew here to
[2:08:31] Vancouver and I sat with him a whole
[2:08:34] day. He said the same thing. And he gave
[2:08:38] brother Brandham first place in the book
[2:08:40] and and a picture of the pillar of fire
[2:08:42] from Houston, the first place in the
[2:08:44] pictorial section called All Things Are
[2:08:47] Possible.
[2:08:50] Is it hard to get in church for
[2:08:51] sponsorship just as it was with our Lord
[2:08:54] Jesus? Cuz it's him.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; That's simple, isn't it?
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; I believe IT, TOO.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; I love I love these people.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; I love the people from Congo.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; I say, "Give us more.
[2:09:18] I see some of these brothers when they
[2:09:20] you you turn around and and and and they
[2:09:23] say, "Well, we're going to have prayer
[2:09:24] and somebody's going to pray." And you
[2:09:26] turn around and here you see the
[2:09:28] brothers and they're there like this
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; to me. It's just a it's just a degree of
[2:09:37] respect. I saw them in Congo praying so
[2:09:41] earnestly and brother Deoka has to sing
[2:09:45] some songs to get them to stop praying.
[2:09:48] What are they praying for? They're
[2:09:49] praying with earnestness.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to inspire this
[2:09:54] congregation, not to look upon these
[2:09:56] services like the last service. Say, I
[2:09:59] want I'm COMING INTO THESE DOORS WITH
[2:10:01] EXPECTATION IN MY HEART. And if Satan's
[2:10:04] been giving you a rough time, DON'T YOU
[2:10:06] DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING OUT OF
[2:10:08] THOSE DOORS UNTIL YOU'RE FREE.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT A GOD THAT WORKS. GOD
[2:10:14] SPOKE THIS WORD. GOD SENT THIS MESSAGE
[2:10:17] AND HE DIDN'T SEND IT FOR HIS OWN
[2:10:19] BENEFIT. SEND IT FOR YOUR BENEFIT.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:10:33] Brother Carter, your wife's not well.
[2:10:36] Your wife is not well.
[2:10:40] She's home this day. And when you get
[2:10:43] home, may you find her better.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; That's what this is all about.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; And he sent his word and healed them.
[2:11:03] He says, "But he came." But there come a
[2:11:06] time where there's a message that always
[2:11:08] follows every sign because the sign has
[2:11:12] a voice.
[2:11:15] And Jesus said, "Can I have just a five
[2:11:18] more minutes or so?" And Jesus said, "I
[2:11:22] have glorified thee on the earth. I have
[2:11:27] finished
[2:11:29] the work
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; which thou gavest me to do.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; I've completed. I've added anything
[2:11:37] that's wanting.
[2:11:41] Hello. Please don't weary on me.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; I'm getting a point across to you.
[2:11:48] Apostle Paul said, "I was not
[2:11:49] disobedient to the heavenly vision 30
[2:11:52] years down the road." He's telling what
[2:11:54] happened at the beginning. Some of you
[2:11:56] can't go back 30 years down the road.
[2:11:58] You haven't got that kind of a history
[2:12:00] walking with God. But he's saying and
[2:12:02] it's in the word of God for our benefit.
[2:12:05] I've been I was focused. I stayed true
[2:12:08] for 30 years. Oh, King Agria. AND HE
[2:12:11] SAID, "DUST THOU BELIEVE IN THE
[2:12:13] RESURRECTION?" HE SAID, "I DUST THOU
[2:12:14] BELIEVE THE PROPHETS?" AND HE DIDN'T
[2:12:16] even give him a chance. He said, "I know
[2:12:17] that you believe.
[2:12:20] And King Agria with all of his royalty
[2:12:23] almost. Thou persuadeest me to become a
[2:12:27] Christian. And Apostle Paul, he wasn't
[2:12:29] finished. I would that you weren't
[2:12:31] almost, but altogether
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; as I am, except for these bonds there.
[2:12:37] The prisoner was preaching to the king.
[2:12:39] Hallelujah. The prisoner The PRISONER
[2:12:42] WASN'T BOUND. THE KING WAS BOUND. THE
[2:12:46] PRISONER WASN'T BLIND. HE SAID, "I WISH
[2:12:48] YOU WERE LIKE ME. I WISH YOU COULD SEE
[2:12:50] WHAT I SEE.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; I WISH YOU WERE LIKE ME EXCEPT FOR THESE
[2:12:53] BONDS."
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WILLIAM
[2:12:59] BRAND 30, 40, 50 YEARS AGO. WE'RE
[2:13:02] TALKING ABOUT THE JESUS CHRIST WHO SENT
[2:13:04] HIM.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; THE SAME ONE WHO SAID WHEN PAUL SAID,
[2:13:08] "WHO ART THOU, LORD?" SAID, "I'M JESUS."
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; I'm Jesus.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:15] Let the people say,
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; "For he shall save his people from their
[2:13:20] sins."
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; What did he do? Do you get the
[2:13:25] connection?
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "WHO ARE YOU?
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; I'M JESUS."
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; And out of the VERY MIND OF GOD, FOR I
[2:13:32] SHALL SAVE MY PEOPLE. I'LL CERTAINLY
[2:13:35] SAVE MY MESSENGER.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; I shall save my PEOPLE FROM THEIR
[2:13:38] UNBELIEF. AND THERE HE WAS, RELIGIOUS TO
[2:13:41] THE EYEBROWS, BUT FULL OF UNBELIEF. BUT
[2:13:44] JESUS CAME TO DELIVER HIM FROM HIS
[2:13:46] UNBELIEF.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; I don't care how many years you've been.
[2:13:50] I don't care how how well you know the
[2:13:52] Bible or how well you know the message.
[2:13:54] He come to deliver us.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; And I don't see what I want to see in
[2:14:02] the services. I DON'T SEE WHAT I THINK
[2:14:05] YOU SHOULD BE receiving in the services.
[2:14:07] And so I'm even asking God, is is there
[2:14:10] something wrong? Is there something
[2:14:11] wrong with me? or what? What is it? Give
[2:14:13] us a word. I prayed this morning. Give
[2:14:16] us the WORD THAT WILL BLAST ALL OF THIS
[2:14:18] UNBELIEF, ALL OF THESE THINGS out of our
[2:14:21] midst
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; so the PEOPLE WILL COME TO THE HOUSE OF
[2:14:25] GOD EXPECTING TO SEE GOD on the scene.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; We have needs.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; You have needs. You want to have
[2:14:36] confidence that when the people pray,
[2:14:39] they know the God in whom they serve.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; I've got to stop
[2:14:56] because I think I've wore you out.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Wore you down.
[2:15:06] I should probably at least tell you this
[2:15:12] that when brother Vanom
[2:15:14] when they when God determined it was the
[2:15:17] time
[2:15:19] to take him into such an experience and
[2:15:22] such a
[2:15:26] the vision of the seven angels coming
[2:15:30] left him numb
[2:15:32] and he said I could see those angels
[2:15:34] angels and those shaped back wings
[2:15:37] traveling faster than sound could travel
[2:15:41] and they came from eternity in a split
[2:15:43] like a twinkling of an eye not enough to
[2:15:45] bat your eye or just a twinkle he says
[2:15:48] there he says I didn't have time to
[2:15:50] count
[2:15:52] and I believe in one message standing in
[2:15:54] the gap or one of the messages said it
[2:15:56] was five he thought it was five but he
[2:15:58] says here he didn't even have time to
[2:16:00] count he said I didn't have time no more
[2:16:03] than just to book. I was caught up into
[2:16:05] the pyramid of constellation. I thought,
[2:16:07] "Oh Lord, what does this vision mean?"
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Now he's asking, "What does this vision
[2:16:12] mean?"
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; And I wondered and then it came to me,
[2:16:16] not a voice, just came to me. Oh, that
[2:16:19] is the angels of the Lord coming TO GIVE
[2:16:22] ME MY NEW COMMISSION.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:16:30] NOT JUST TO TAKE A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD,
[2:16:32] BUT THE NEW COMMISSION.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS FROM THE OPENING OF THE
[2:16:37] SEALS FORWARD WAS A NEW COMMISSION
[2:16:41] BECAUSE NOW THE WORD JESUS CHRIST NOW
[2:16:44] HAD TO BE REVEALED.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; He had to be revealed AND SHOW WHO HE
[2:16:49] WAS to the people.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; And if you if you want to understand,
[2:16:54] you just take it from me if you haven't
[2:16:56] read it. Even from the seals forward,
[2:16:58] people get engrossed in the seals and
[2:17:00] and they, you know, it becomes so deb
[2:17:02] heavy and rather deep and so on so
[2:17:04] forth. But just remember the God has
[2:17:08] already spoken to him and told him this
[2:17:10] is a new commission.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[2:17:14] It's sufficient.
[2:17:16] I don't have time to take you all
[2:17:18] through it to finish the work.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; So he could say, I've been faithful. I
[2:17:24] was not disobedient to the heavenly
[2:17:26] vision. I stayed true to it all the way
[2:17:29] through and in the end and from the
[2:17:31] vision from the seals. Now he has this
[2:17:34] vision then goes Arizona has a meeting
[2:17:37] of those angels and when he speaks the
[2:17:39] seals he says this this will cause
[2:17:42] 10,000
[2:17:44] of my friends to leave me.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; And they did.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; BUT HE REMAINED FOCUSED. HE REMAINED ON
[2:17:52] COURSE BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE WORDS TO
[2:17:55] REVEAL JESUS CHRIST TO YOU. AND IF YOU
[2:17:58] SAY, "WELL, I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T REALLY
[2:17:59] GOT THAT EXPERIENCE." IT'S THERE HANGING
[2:18:01] THERE FOR YOU.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; It's the SAME AS JESUS WALKING. HE WAS
[2:18:05] WALKING ALL THROUGH AND HE WAS WALKING.
[2:18:07] CAIAPHAS HAD ACCESS. ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE
[2:18:09] HAD ACCESS. THEY DIDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE
[2:18:11] OF IT.
[2:18:15] THEY WENT TO the synagogue, sat there,
[2:18:16] listened to somebody speak, and didn't
[2:18:19] take advantage of it. Oh God, sometime
[2:18:22] we wonder if I could have only been
[2:18:24] there. If I only could have heard words.
[2:18:27] And today I talk to him.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; I talk to our Lord Jesus.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I would love to just take him by the
[2:18:34] feet and hold him. I don't have that
[2:18:36] chance. THEY HAD THE CHANCE AND THEY
[2:18:38] MISSED IT.
[2:18:41] And people today say, "Oh, Brother
[2:18:43] Biscllow, you had such an opportunity
[2:18:45] with the prophet. You took him and so
[2:18:46] on. I was reading some of his letters
[2:18:48] last night."
[2:18:50] And uh
[2:18:53] he wrote one letter. He said, "Mom, I
[2:18:55] just died last week. My mom passed away
[2:18:59] last week." And I'd forgotten I had that
[2:19:02] letter. I was just reading it to the
[2:19:04] brothers.
[2:19:06] You might say, "Oh, Brother Red, but I
[2:19:07] didn't have that experience." you have a
[2:19:09] greater experience.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Blessed are they
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; that see not
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; and yet believe.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; This Jesus, this Jesus that I'm speaking
[2:19:20] to about today, I'm giving a testimony.
[2:19:24] He can take
[2:19:26] a as it were.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Hey kids, I maybe didn't have the home
[2:19:34] that to live in that you lived in.
[2:19:38] But he he'll take anybody.
[2:19:45] He'll take a girl
[2:19:48] living alone with her father cuz her mom
[2:19:51] has left and mom and dad are divorced.
[2:19:53] So you know what divorce is.
[2:19:56] This is dangerous for me because it goes
[2:19:58] out on the internet. But Sister Bisco
[2:20:00] come from a home with a divorce
[2:20:04] and was living alone with her dad from
[2:20:06] 12 years old. How many of you kids 12
[2:20:08] years old?
[2:20:11] But one thing
[2:20:13] couldn't keep her out of church. Her dad
[2:20:16] didn't go to church. Her mom didn't go
[2:20:18] to church. Her brother didn't go to
[2:20:19] church. Her sister didn't go to church.
[2:20:21] Nobody encouraged her to go to church.
[2:20:25] That's where I met her.
[2:20:27] We were just two kids in church.
[2:20:32] But she wanted to be in church. Some of
[2:20:34] her earliest memories when she was about
[2:20:36] four or five years old sitting on the
[2:20:38] front bench of a little tent meeting.
[2:20:40] She doesn't know who's preaching. She
[2:20:41] wanted to be in church and sit there and
[2:20:43] and kicking her feet in the shavings.
[2:20:48] And then what I knew about her, I knew
[2:20:50] that, you know, she'd sing, had a
[2:20:53] beautiful voice and sing just as clear
[2:20:56] as a crystal.
[2:20:58] sing songs
[2:21:01] that had such depth and such meaning.
[2:21:05] And that was that's who you know as
[2:21:08] Sister Biscll today. But we didn't know
[2:21:10] that as as young people. But you know
[2:21:13] what we did do?
[2:21:16] Stayed focused.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; We didn't even know. Nobody was telling
[2:21:19] us to stay focused. But we just
[2:21:24] there was nothing else.
[2:21:28] We got married quite young. She was 18
[2:21:31] and I was 19, just shy of 20.
[2:21:35] But we and I just wrote it down last
[2:21:39] night. That's why I said we didn't have
[2:21:41] a home. So, we figured we probably could
[2:21:45] make a better home together than we
[2:21:46] could apart. So, we got married.
[2:21:50] Been 59 years in a in a little while.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say that's staying
[2:21:58] focused.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Did you have any trouble? Lots.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't tell me you had any trouble.
[2:22:07] And we're two humans.
[2:22:09] That we have trouble. Not trouble
[2:22:12] trouble, but you know what I mean. She
[2:22:15] has her ideas and she has
[2:22:19] I want to get back.
[2:22:23] I want to bring it home to you. want to
[2:22:26] bring it home to the families. God's
[2:22:29] greater
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; than the problem.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads in prayer.
[2:22:40] Heavenly Father,
[2:22:43] what is it you want to do at this
[2:22:45] moment?
[2:22:47] What is it you want to do? Is somebody
[2:22:50] ready? Oh God, they feel so urged. I
[2:22:54] want I want I want to show that I've
[2:22:56] given myself. I give myself
[2:23:00] I want to refocus. I've been out of
[2:23:02] touch. I've been out of focus. God has
[2:23:04] not really been one in my number one in
[2:23:07] my life. I want to I want to surrender
[2:23:10] myself now.
[2:23:13] I'm going to invite you while I'm
[2:23:14] praying.
[2:23:17] If you are here and you're not birthed
[2:23:20] by the power of God, I don't want to
[2:23:23] persuade you here with strong speaking,
[2:23:26] but I want the Holy Ghost. Come, oh,
[2:23:29] Holy Spirit.
[2:23:32] Come, oh Spirit of God, and speak to the
[2:23:36] individuals
[2:23:38] that are prepared to meet with you in a
[2:23:41] special way, that have a particular
[2:23:42] need, and they're here, oh God. Some may
[2:23:46] be sick and afflicted. We don't want to
[2:23:48] hear long stories about how things
[2:23:50] happened. We want to hear the great
[2:23:52] rejoicing about a God that comes on the
[2:23:55] scene
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; and delivers people as we have seen you
[2:23:59] do, Lord, with signs and wonders. And we
[2:24:01] want to see people's lives changed.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; We do not want to see them just continue
[2:24:06] on as young people amongst the other
[2:24:09] young people. We want to see them
[2:24:11] transformed so that others see there's a
[2:24:14] power here.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; There's a power that's present.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Father, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:24:22] we ask it. Amen.
[2:24:27] [music]
[2:24:32] Let's just stand to our feet, shall we?
[2:24:41] I don't know how God has spoken to you,
[2:24:44] but I want you to obey the Lord.
[2:24:48] I want you to obey him.
[2:24:51] [music] And if you want prayer or need
[2:24:53] prayer, we've got ministering brethren
[2:24:54] here.
[2:24:57] And we don't need any history.
[2:24:59] We've had people just go by in a prayer
[2:25:02] line before.
[2:25:03] And God did that. Sister Jerry Harris
[2:25:06] that I just read her email. She came
[2:25:10] across the platform injured. [music]
[2:25:14] Injured in her legs and in her back and
[2:25:17] before she walked off, she was healed
[2:25:19] instantly.
[2:25:22] Friends, this is the kind of Jesus I'm
[2:25:24] talking about.
[2:25:27] And if you know within your heart
[2:25:31] that there's something different in this
[2:25:33] service, God is talking to me different,
[2:25:37] [music] then I think I don't need you to
[2:25:39] come forward. But if you feel that it
[2:25:42] would be good to have somebody pray with
[2:25:43] you, [music]
[2:25:44] then you I I'll welcome you to come.
[2:25:50] [music]
[2:25:54] Oh God, in the name of Jesus,
[2:25:58] let's just everyone bow our heads for a
[2:26:00] moment.
[2:26:03] Lord, I pray that you will
[2:26:06] finish the work as you would have it
[2:26:09] finished.
[2:26:11] Whoever it is that you may be speaking
[2:26:13] to, and if there's none, that would be
[2:26:15] fine.
[2:26:17] [music] If there are those, oh God,
[2:26:20] regardless of age, regardless
[2:26:23] of their situation,
[2:26:25] but they know that they just now
[2:26:29] need to allow faith to be released
[2:26:33] that they might receive from you,
[2:26:34] Father,
[2:26:36] in the name of Jesus,
[2:26:38] in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:26:42] get glory to yourself,
[2:26:45] get glory to your name.
[2:26:48] I wonder if the people would just begin
[2:26:50] to pray. Would you each one pray?
[2:26:54] Satan is waring right now and I'm not
[2:26:56] prepared to give in. [music]
[2:26:58] Satan is battling because he doesn't
[2:27:01] want he doesn't want there's some
[2:27:05] somebody's in a big struggle. You're in
[2:27:08] a big struggle right now.
[2:27:10] Why don't you just step out and say, "I
[2:27:12] am not going to allow this enemy to bind
[2:27:16] me and hold me back any longer. Whatever
[2:27:20] the cost, whatever it takes, Lord Jesus,
[2:27:24] I give myself to you. I surrender myself
[2:27:27] to you, my Lord Jesus. My Lord Jesus,
[2:27:34] just as it would please you, Lord. All
[2:27:38] we want to do is please you
[2:27:41] all that I am.
[2:27:43] All that I ever can be.
[2:27:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Wonder Brother
[2:27:49] Ryan if we can just sing that simple
[2:27:51] chorus. I'll say yes.

[2:29:26] the words that you've used. his other
[2:29:28] words in him. I'll say [music] yes.
