TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Yay, my children, the Lord would say unto thee this morning, draw thou nigh unto the Lord. Yay, as Ruth did cleave unto Naomi, and was brought into the promised land. Yeah, even so thou, if thou shalt cleave unto the word of the Lord, thou shalt be brought into the promises of the Lord. Yay, thou shalt be brought into my rest, sayaeth the Lord. And as a doctrine dust fall as a dw in this hour, yay, my word is going forth to my servants. Yay, it shall incompass this earth. But except thou be filled with the spirit, thou shalt not know the voice of the Lord. Therefore the Lord would say unto thee, depart thou from iniquity. Yay, clean up thy life. Yay, leave those things behind that are worldly, ye that are fleshly, that are not a desire unto the Lord. For the Lord was saying unto thee in this hour, that except thou doth repent, ye except thou do turn unto the Lord with all thine heart, and be willing to desert that which is behind, yay, the Lord shall not hear thee when he cometh. For the Lord is coming as a bride. For I the bridegroom for his bride. And as a bride doth prepare herself and get herself ready for the coming of the bridegroom, even so must my children get themselves ready even in this hour that they might be ready at my coming, sayeth the Lord. Therefore watch ye and pray, sayeth the Lord. Hearken thou unto my word that is going forth. For my word shall not return unto me v boys, but it shall accomplish those things which I have predestinated, sayeth the Lord, that shall be in the last day. Therefore, hearken thou, hearken thou, turn thou from thine own wisdom. Turn thou from thine own doctrine. Yay, turn thou from that which is led thee in bondage, and turn thou unto the word of the Lord, and thou shalt be set freeh. Yay, my mercy shall be upon thee, sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Your heads bowed now. Just a moment.
