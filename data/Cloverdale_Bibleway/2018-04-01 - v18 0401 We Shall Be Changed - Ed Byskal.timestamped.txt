[8:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:53] God bless you this Easter morning,
[8:56] &gt;&gt; resurrection morning. Can you turn me
[8:59] down just a little bit here, Michael?
[9:02] You love the Lord this morning.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful time to be alive. What
[9:06] a wonderful time to be a Christian.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought to maybe just say the
[9:12] Lord's prayer together. You can put it
[9:14] on the screen. 13:32.
[9:20] Just in prayer this morning getting
[9:22] ready for the service. I thought what a
[9:24] wonderful way to start the morning in
[9:26] one heart, in one mind, and in one
[9:29] accord. How many have a busy life? Okay,
[9:32] who doesn't have a busy life?
[9:36] Maybe we can focus our heart this
[9:37] morning
[9:39] and the Lord Jesus would be pleased to
[9:42] come down and dwell in your temple that
[9:45] you've prepared that you've consecrated.
[9:48] So let's just say the Lord's prayer
[9:49] together this morning. Our Father, which
[9:54] art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[9:58] kingdom come, thy will be done in earth
[10:03] as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
[10:07] daily bread, and forgive us our debts as
[10:11] we forgive our debtors,
[10:14] and lead us not into temptation,
[10:17] but deliver us from evil. For thine is
[10:21] the kingdom, and the power, and the
[10:24] glory forever. Amen.
[10:29] Amen. Father in heaven, we love you.
[10:35] Father
[10:37] in heaven,
[10:40] we love you.
[10:43] [Music]
[10:45] We lift your name in all
[10:50] the earth.
[10:55] May your kingdom
[10:57] be established
[10:59] in our praises
[11:01] [Music]
[11:04] as your people
[11:07] declare your mighty word.
[11:12] Blessed be the Lord
[11:16] God
[11:18] Almighty.
[11:23] who was and is and is
[11:27] to come.
[11:30] Blessed be the Lord
[11:34] God
[11:36] Almighty
[11:41] who lives forever
[11:46] more singing blessed be
[11:50] blessed be the Lord
[11:54] God
[11:56] Almighty. mighty king
[12:00] who was and is and is
[12:05] to come.
[12:07] Blessed be the Lord
[12:12] God
[12:14] Almighty
[12:18] who lives forever.
[12:21] [Music]
[12:26] Hallelujah.
[12:29] Hallelujah.
[12:32] Amen. We'll just
[12:35] read a prayer request we have from
[12:38] Sister Sheila.
[12:41] Brother Jeff Wman, would you mind
[12:43] opening the service in a word of prayer?
[12:47] We want to remember Sister Sharon Van
[12:49] Wick. Um they found cancer and she's
[12:53] just recently had surgery. is trusting
[12:55] that the Lord would continue to heal
[12:58] her. Just asking that the congregation
[13:00] would bind their hearts together in
[13:02] prayer for her need and hold her up
[13:04] before the Lord.
[13:07] How many has a need this morning?
[13:11] Truly a needy people. Wouldn't want to
[13:14] get to the place where we have no need,
[13:16] but we want to trust the Lord this
[13:18] morning for each and every need. Brother
[13:19] Jeff, God bless you this morning.
[13:27] Let's bow our heads.
[13:29] Wonderful father, what an awesome
[13:31] privilege it is to come into your house
[13:32] this morning once again, this
[13:34] resurrection morning. Father, you've
[13:37] done so very much for us. When we look
[13:39] back at the time, Lord, when you laid
[13:40] down your life for us, Father, we're so
[13:42] grateful this morning. We come with open
[13:44] hearts, with thanksgiving, Father. We
[13:47] receive whatever you have for us today,
[13:49] Lord. Lord, would you just give us
[13:51] receptive hearts that we could hear that
[13:53] still small voice, Father, and may you
[13:55] come amongst us, Lord, like you did with
[13:57] those that walked to Emmas, oh Father,
[14:00] and speak to us, Lord. And also how you
[14:03] appeared into Mary Magdalene that
[14:04] morning, oh Father. May you come to
[14:06] every one of us individually, oh Father.
[14:09] You have something for us and we want to
[14:11] receive it, Lord Jesus. So we just pray
[14:13] that thy will be done, Father. Thy
[14:16] kingdom come, thy will be done, as the
[14:18] prayer says. Oh Lord, and we just pray
[14:20] for the needs of every individual in
[14:22] here this morning, oh God. You're a God
[14:24] that can be touched by the feeling of
[14:25] our infirmities, Lord Jesus. You were
[14:28] bruised for our iniquities, oh God. And
[14:30] by those stripes, we are healed for
[14:32] that. For our sister Sharon, Lord, that
[14:35] has this cancer, oh Father. We know,
[14:38] Lord, that cancer cannot stand against
[14:40] you, oh Father. That's been a promise
[14:41] that have been given us in this age,
[14:43] Lord. It's a it's a demon and we have
[14:46] the right to come against him. In the
[14:47] name of Jesus Christ, oh Father, we love
[14:50] you and we commit this day to you, oh
[14:52] Father, as we walk along this road
[14:55] together, Father. We ask you now that
[14:58] you would bless the offering, oh Father,
[14:59] as it's being taken up. Bless the giver,
[15:02] Lord, and may you bless the people,
[15:03] Lord, and open their hearts, Father, and
[15:06] may you use it for your kingdom and for
[15:08] your glory. We commit all things to you
[15:09] in Jesus name. Amen.
[15:16] God bless. You may have your seats this
[15:17] morning.

[16:03] in my darkest hour.
[16:06] You're my hiding place.

[18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Matthew Wilson has a
[18:57] special for us. So we'll just have
[18:59] brother Matthew come and get ready. I've
[19:03] got a couple of announcements to make.
[19:06] Uh, one wedding announcement reminder
[19:08] for John Louie Flores and Sarah Garland.
[19:12] Their wedding is on April the 7th, so
[19:15] just a few days away at 100 p.m. here at
[19:18] the church and everyone is invited to
[19:21] both the ceremony and the reception
[19:24] following. So, the reception, I believe,
[19:26] is at 4:00. Well, looking forward to a
[19:29] real wonderful day as I'm sure that they
[19:31] have made lots of preparation. We heard
[19:34] it on Wednesday night. You know, a
[19:36] couple start seeing that look in each
[19:38] other's eye and dad's nudges. Come on,
[19:41] it's time to go. Five more minutes. The
[19:44] bridegroom,
[19:46] our bridegroom,
[19:49] he's made a lot of preparation.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; He went away to prepare a place
[19:55] &gt;&gt; just for you.
[19:57] A lot has gone into it. A lot of
[19:59] thought. Our heavenly father cares very
[20:01] much for each and every one of us. Those
[20:04] that are visiting with us, some that
[20:05] aren't necessarily visitors. We love you
[20:08] very much. For the gym, I bless you.
[20:11] Good to have you here. Your wife and I
[20:14] saw the
[20:17] somebody else I saw back here.
[20:20] The Robinson's family has been reunited.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Sister Dana, God bless you. Why don't we
[20:26] give sister Dana nice warm welcome?
[20:34] Pat and Gail Venoi from Missoula,
[20:36] Montana. Bridget Wilson and
[20:39] granddaughter of Neil and Subo are all
[20:41] here. Why don't you wave your hands
[20:43] wherever you might be this morning? God
[20:45] bless you this morning. Good to have you
[20:46] here.
[20:48] Amen.
[20:50] Members of the body of Jesus Christ.
[20:52] Wonderful. Anyone else that's visiting?
[20:54] I might have missed you. I apologize.
[20:56] We're certainly happy to have you here
[20:58] in the congregation this morning.
[21:02] Matthew, God bless you.
[21:18] Hear
[21:30] them shout, "Hosana!
[21:33] Our Messiah has come at last."
[21:37] For so long we've been waiting.
[21:41] Now the waiting's in the past.
[21:45] A bright new day is dawning.
[21:49] One we only dreamed we'd know.
[21:53] Our longing souls
[21:57] were losing hope.
[22:00] But not anymore.
[22:03] Now everything has changed.
[22:09] Not anymore.
[22:11] Life will never be the same.
[22:18] We wondered if we'd see the coming
[22:22] kingom of our Lord, but not anymore.
[22:29] Not anymore.
[22:31] [Music]
[22:34] I can't believe it happened.
[22:37] We were there when suddenly
[22:41] there were torches in the garden.
[22:46] There were soldiers with the priest.
[22:50] And now they say for certain
[22:53] that he's been crucified.
[22:57] We thought Jesus
[23:01] would deliver us,
[23:04] but not anymore.
[23:07] Now everything has changed.
[23:12] No, not anymore.
[23:15] Life will never be the same.
[23:21] We dreamed about his kingdom
[23:25] and all it held in store. But not
[23:29] anymore.
[23:30] [Music]
[23:32] Not anymore.
[23:35] more. But now, what's this? I see.
[23:40] The stones been rolled away.
[23:45] Jesus stands before us where he once was
[23:49] in the grave.
[23:54] But not anymore.
[23:58] Now everything has changed.
[24:03] No, not anymore.
[24:06] Life will never be the same.
[24:12] Jesus is alive. I may have questioned
[24:17] that before, but not anymore.
[24:21] [Music]
[24:23] Not anymore.
[24:24] [Music]
[24:27] My heart may once have doubted
[24:31] the power of our Lord,
[24:36] but not anymore.
[24:42] Not any
[24:46] more.
[24:47] [Music]
[24:57] [Applause]
[25:04] Matthew, thank you very much. We
[25:05] appreciate that. This morning,
[25:08] turn the service to our pastor this
[25:10] morning. He lives. He lives. We serve a
[25:12] risen savior. He's in the world
[25:16] today.
[25:19] Ryan, were did you want to sing?
[25:23] Yeah.
[25:24] All right. We'll just sing the first
[25:26] verse of this and maybe Brother Ryan
[25:28] will have his special and we'll turn the
[25:30] service to our pastor. I serve a risen
[25:34] savior.
[25:36] He's in the world today.
[25:40] I know that he is living.
[25:45] Whatever man may say,
[25:49] for I see his hand of mercy,
[25:54] I hear his voice of cheer.
[25:58] And just as I need him, he's always
[26:05] here. For he lives.
[26:09] He lives.
[26:11] Christ Jesus lives today.
[26:15] He walks with me and talks with me along
[26:20] my narrow way.
[26:24] He lives
[26:28] salvation to him.
[26:33] You ask me how I know he lives. lives.
[26:39] He lived
[26:42] within
[26:44] my heart.
[26:47] [Music]
[27:03] God bless you this morning. Romans 5'8
[27:07] says, "But God commendeth his love
[27:08] toward us in that while we were yet
[27:10] sinners, Christ died for us." And in
[27:13] Corinthians, Paul says, "For the
[27:15] preaching of the cross is to them that
[27:17] perish foolishness, but unto us which
[27:20] are saved, it is the power of God." And
[27:23] this song is called It's Still the
[27:24] Cross. And I just haven't been able to
[27:26] escape it. And I just believe that it's
[27:28] what the Lord wants us to do this
[27:30] morning. So I trust that you'll be
[27:31] blessed by it.
[27:48] It's not conservative
[27:51] or liberal,
[27:53] however they're defined.
[27:56] It's not about interpretation
[28:01] or the judgement of the mind. It's the
[28:06] opposite of politics,
[28:10] power, or prestige.
[28:14] It's about a simple message.
[28:18] And whether we believe, it's still the
[28:24] cross.
[28:25] [Music]
[28:27] It's still the blood of Calary
[28:31] that cleanses
[28:33] sin
[28:36] and sets the captive free. It's still
[28:41] the name,
[28:44] the name of Jesus that has power to save
[28:49] the lost.
[28:53] It's still the cross.
[28:56] [Music]
[29:04] Some may water down theology and preach
[29:08] a word to suit their needs. Some may
[29:13] justify sweet subtleties that are
[29:17] wrapped in noble deeds. Some may alter
[29:22] their convictions
[29:24] to adapt to social whims,
[29:28] but they cannot change the gospel or the
[29:33] truth contained within. It's still the
[29:37] cross.
[29:40] It's still the blood of Calvary
[29:43] that cleanses sin
[29:48] and sets the captives free. It's still
[29:52] the name,
[29:55] the name of Jesus that has power to save
[30:01] the lost.
[30:04] It's still the cross.
[30:08] Though some may say it's man's religion
[30:13] or ancient history,
[30:16] but the cross of Jesus still remains the
[30:21] price for sin
[30:24] that sets us free.
[30:27] It's still the cross.
[30:32] It's still the blood of Calary
[30:35] that cleanses
[30:37] sin
[30:40] and sets the captive free. It's still
[30:45] the name,
[30:48] the name of Jesus that has power to save
[30:53] the lost.
[31:00] It's still the cross.
[31:03] [Music]
[31:09] It's still the cross.
[31:16] [Music]
[31:23] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[31:26] Amen.
[31:27] [Applause]
[31:32] Let's sing the last two verses of He
[31:34] Lives.
[31:38] As we invite our pastor to come this
[31:40] morning, there's freedom in the house of
[31:43] worship today. In all the world around
[31:49] me, I see his loving care.
[31:54] And though my heart grows weary,
[31:59] I never will despair,
[32:03] I know that he is leading
[32:08] through all the stormy blast.
[32:12] The day of his appearing
[32:16] will come at last.
[32:21] For he lives.
[32:23] He lives.
[32:25] Christ Jesus lives today.
[32:30] He walks with me and talks with me. A
[32:34] long life away.
[32:38] He lays.
[32:41] He lives
[32:43] salvation to him. But
[32:48] you ask me how I know he lives.
[32:55] He lives
[32:58] within
[33:00] my heart.
[33:02] [Music]
[33:04] Rejoice for Christian.
[33:07] Lift up your voice and sing.
[33:12] Eternal
[33:13] hallelujah
[33:16] to Jesus Christ the King.
[33:21] The hope of all who seek him. The help
[33:26] of all who are
[33:30] the
[33:32] so
[33:34] good and kind
[33:38] for he lives.
[33:41] [Applause]
[33:42] Christ Jesus lives today.
[33:47] He walks with me and talks with me along
[33:52] lies their way away.
[33:55] For he laid
[33:58] he laid
[34:00] salvation to him.
[34:05] You ask me how I know he lives.
[34:12] He lives
[34:15] within
[34:17] my heart.
[34:22] All right.
[34:24] God bless you.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Happy Easter morning.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask brother uh Derek
[34:32] to help us sing that chorus one more
[34:35] time. He lives.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; And when we say he lives within my
[34:39] heart, I just want to hear it. All
[34:43] right, why don't you stand? We're all
[34:46] standing.
[34:52] Christ Jesus live today.
[34:57] He lost me and
[35:01] I
[35:05] for
[35:10] salvation to him.
[35:15] You ask me how I know he lives.
[35:23] He lives
[35:25] with me.
[35:28] my heart.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; He almost made me believe it.
[35:37] He lives within my heart. I do believe
[35:40] it.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just have a word of prayer.
[35:44] Heavenly Father, we say kind Heavenly
[35:47] Father, Jehovah Gyra, you have provided
[35:51] everything we have need of for our
[35:54] lives, for eternal life, for today,
[35:59] tomorrow, and whatever future we have.
[36:02] You have provided it. You're the great
[36:05] provider. We want to bless your name
[36:08] today. Lord, we want to be a true
[36:10] witness of the true vine. Lord Jesus,
[36:14] Lord Jesus, you're worthy of every
[36:17] effort that we can make. And you're
[36:19] worthy of all of our strength and all of
[36:22] our life and energy that we have. You
[36:26] have given us this, Lord, and we thank
[36:28] you for it. We thank you for voices that
[36:30] we can sing and praise and glorify your
[36:34] name, that you are the resurrected
[36:36] Christ. We want to thank you this
[36:39] morning that you have sent a message
[36:41] that is evidence of the resurrection
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Lord and we are living proof of that
[36:48] resurrection.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Bless now the word and as we approach it
[36:52] in Jesus name. Amen.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[36:59] I have one uh quote I want to put up
[37:02] first and then uh
[37:10] brother John would you come and read
[37:12] this?
[37:16] Okay, we'll have this first quote and I
[37:19] I want you to be able to uh read it with
[37:22] us.
[37:28] I made it as large as possible so you
[37:30] can all read it. Uh, and I just want to
[37:34] emphasize he conquered.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; That sounds good.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; The royal seed of Abraham.
[37:44] Now the natural seed could not point to
[37:46] that, but the royal seed can conquer.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Already conquered.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. For he has gone before us and
[37:54] conquered every gate for us.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; He is now after 2,000 years. He stands
[38:01] in the midst of us. The mighty
[38:03] conqueror.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Not only did he conquer sickness,
[38:08] &gt;&gt; he conquered sickness.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; He conquered temptation.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to just stop there for a
[38:15] moment. How many of you remember just
[38:18] two weeks ago
[38:20] uh brother Gindo had sent me an email
[38:24] and he said I'd like to have sister
[38:27] Francine and I will come up for prayer.
[38:31] Sister Francine has had leukemia
[38:35] and disease of the bones, a disease of
[38:38] the cancer of the marrow of the bones.
[38:42] And two weeks ago, she stood here. Her
[38:45] count was at 60, which I don't
[38:48] understand all the cell count, the white
[38:51] cell count, I believe it was at 60. And
[38:54] it needed to be around five or six. And
[38:57] in one in and she went immediately after
[39:01] prayer. I don't know just which day, and
[39:04] that's irrelevant, but she went back.
[39:07] brother and sister Gindo sitting here.
[39:10] They went back to the doctor and her
[39:13] count was down to 20. And they said,
[39:15] "But don't say anything yet, so I'm
[39:18] being a good boy. I'm not I'm not going
[39:21] to say anything." They wanted to go once
[39:24] more. And they went once more to the
[39:26] doctor. And Sister Gindo, who you can
[39:29] shake hands with after the service, they
[39:32] said that her blood is perfect.
[39:45] Why don't you stand up, sister Gendo?
[39:47] Here she is. Brother Gendo.
[39:54] Praise God.
[39:56] Praise God.
[39:59] And and not only that, while they're
[40:02] still standing, the white cor uh the
[40:04] white cell count went down to four.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; I say he's risen.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; He's alive.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; And as the prophet said, and he's with
[40:18] us.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; He's here in the place
[40:22] &gt;&gt; here in this place. And uh uh not only
[40:27] did they say about the blood count, but
[40:30] they said that they they what else was
[40:34] it they said about the marrow, the
[40:36] bones. Uh there was another it was just
[40:41] normal
[40:42] and they want I want to give glory to
[40:45] God. It's one thing to ask, it's another
[40:47] thing to give glory to God.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for that
[41:01] testimony.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; And thank you for that faith.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Jim, Sister Joy, it's good to
[41:07] see you.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Have we finished this here? No. I think
[41:13] we we just got He conquered a few things
[41:16] there.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:19] He conquered sickness.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; He conquered temptation.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; He conquered every enemy.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; He conquered death.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; He conquered hell.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; He conquered the grave.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; And rose up again.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; And 2,000 years later.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Here he stands among us this afternoon.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Here he is.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Identifying himself today.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; The mighty conqueror.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's here alive vindicating his
[41:49] promise. Royal seed of Abraham. Oh my.
[41:53] Amen. Thank you, brother John.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:01] Isn't it wonderful?
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Nice to see brother Ed master
[42:08] here with us.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; His wife. God bless you.
[42:13] And all who are visiting.
[42:15] I want to I want to speak on something
[42:18] that will be very natural for this
[42:21] Easter morning. We shall all be changed.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; If you'd like to stand one more time,
[42:30] I'm going to read out of Romans the 12th
[42:33] chapter
[42:36] verses 1 and two. And uh this is the
[42:41] text reading that uh the prophet of God
[42:45] used
[42:47] for his message.
[42:51] The power of transformation.
[42:55] So if you bear that in mind while we
[42:57] read these two verses, the power of
[43:00] transformation
[43:01] and in the service now the message I
[43:05] want to you can take take uh notes if
[43:10] you wish. Now a lot of you have are
[43:13] students or have been students
[43:16] and I would expect you to absorb this as
[43:21] a as a lesson a Sunday school lesson.
[43:25] Now brother Brenham talked about Sunday
[43:27] school lessons and I think he said that
[43:29] he referred to Christ is the mystery of
[43:31] God relieved
[43:34] revealed I think and that's about a
[43:37] threehour service. So we I won't be that
[43:42] long, but I might be over an hour, so
[43:46] just hang on. All right, we've been a
[43:49] long time since we've been studying
[43:52] and preparing.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; All right, we'll read uh Romans the 12th
[43:57] chapter verses 1 and two. I beseech you
[44:01] therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
[44:04] God, that you present your bodies a
[44:08] living sacrifice,
[44:10] holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
[44:15] reasonable service, and be not conformed
[44:18] to this world, but be ye transformed
[44:23] by the renewing of your mind, that you
[44:26] may prove what is that good and
[44:30] acceptable and perfect will of God.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; I'd like to no have you notice with me
[44:38] the second verse and be not conformed.
[44:42] We're not to con be conformed to the
[44:46] world or the influence of the world. And
[44:49] I will be referring to that quite a bit,
[44:53] the influence of things.
[44:56] And then uh but be ye transformed. And
[45:01] it doesn't just say transformed.
[45:03] The prophet said the power of
[45:06] transformation. So the emphasis today is
[45:09] on the power of transformation.
[45:13] Where is that power? And I'll be
[45:16] dwelling on that a bit now. Be
[45:19] transformed. And now he refers to the
[45:22] power by the renewing of your mind
[45:28] that you may prove what is that good and
[45:31] perfect, acceptable and perfect will of
[45:33] God. Heavenly Father, I'm praying that
[45:37] you will be the speaker.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost speak.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; You're the only one that can speak to
[45:45] the very soul of the individuals.
[45:48] I pray that you'll be the speaker.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; We know Lord Jesus, you are the
[45:52] resurrected one.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; So I pray by your resurrection power,
[45:58] &gt;&gt; you will speak to the individual life
[46:00] now in Jesus name. Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Murphy Wong is going to be
[46:08] speaking tonight
[46:10] and uh we're real happy about that.
[46:15] So, I'm sure you'll hear some things of
[46:17] the most recent trip to China.
[46:25] So, now I want to have you think with me
[46:28] about the power of transformation. Not
[46:32] just transformation, but the power of
[46:36] transformation.
[46:37] It's a change. Transformation is a
[46:40] change. And there are many things in
[46:43] this life and by when I wrote this down
[46:49] I was aware that this would encompass
[46:53] everyone.
[46:54] There isn't anyone who has not
[46:56] experienced some kind of change or
[47:00] transformation and it's a big subject
[47:04] and I hope to touch on a number of areas
[47:06] and then you can go and be thinking
[47:09] about it and pondering it and let God by
[47:13] the Holy Spirit quicken that to you
[47:16] &gt;&gt; and make the transformation that he
[47:18] desires that he desires in your life.
[47:22] And there's various things that he uses
[47:25] and I will touch on those as well. There
[47:28] are many things in life that can and do
[47:31] change or transform us.
[47:35] Uh, education
[47:37] can change a young man or a young woman
[47:41] from a teenager
[47:44] into not not merely an adult because
[47:47] that is something that just happens
[47:50] within the individual,
[47:52] &gt;&gt; but it it can bring a transformation.
[47:55] God is able to bring a transformation
[47:58] into an individual. and not only able
[48:01] but there there's something for us to do
[48:04] and that is to yield and allow it
[48:06] happen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be speaking about uh two or
[48:10] three individuals today and some out of
[48:13] the Bible and some
[48:17] are because they lived the life they
[48:20] lived you are here.
[48:22] I want you to think about that and then
[48:25] I want you to make it personal to
[48:26] yourself.
[48:28] Where's your influence? And how can that
[48:31] change? Education can change. It'll take
[48:34] a young man or a young woman and I'll
[48:37] just say it might turn them into some
[48:40] skilled person. They weren't skilled,
[48:43] but they become skilled. How do they
[48:45] become skilled? Well, they've studied.
[48:47] They've gone to college. They've gone to
[48:49] university. They have got taken classes.
[48:52] And some specialists, I know brain uh
[48:56] brain surgeons can go to school for 12
[48:59] or 15 years in order because they they
[49:03] they start and perhaps they're very
[49:06] awkward. Uh I I was with the I was with
[49:09] brother Brandham one time and there was
[49:11] a doctor and he was from Washington
[49:14] State somewhere and uh had gotten a bear
[49:18] and so we stopped and he was brother
[49:21] Brandham said, "Well, don't you want to
[49:23] save the skin?" Well, well, yeah. He
[49:24] thought he might want to save the skin
[49:27] and uh but he didn't know anything about
[49:29] hunting.
[49:30] He absolutely nothing nothing about it.
[49:33] and he took out a little uh little knife
[49:36] that uh
[49:38] I think it was one of these, you know,
[49:41] 99 cent all in one things.
[49:44] And and he started hacking at the at the
[49:48] bone and brother Brandham just said to
[49:50] me, he said, "If I ever get sick, he
[49:52] said, "Just remind me not to call him."
[49:59] So, so he wasn't really maybe skilled or
[50:02] as accomplished as he should be, but we
[50:05] can say that what the things they
[50:07] studied and the people who had gone
[50:10] before them had made a way and they
[50:14] become skilled and become uh wonderfully
[50:18] uh a wonderful physician, a wonderful
[50:22] surgeon. But it was not the power that
[50:25] God's talking about.
[50:27] They were transformed but not by this
[50:31] power
[50:32] &gt;&gt; that God is talking about.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[50:36] &gt;&gt; I want to fix that in your mind. There's
[50:39] different kinds of power. There are some
[50:42] that are we're we're born we're born as
[50:46] a
[50:48] a male or a female. We're born and and
[50:52] we develop in life. There's there's
[50:56] there's something within us that changes
[51:00] us from childhood. And Apostle Paul
[51:02] says, "When I was a child,
[51:05] &gt;&gt; I spake as a child." He saw things as a
[51:09] child. But when he became a man, he
[51:12] said, "I put away childish things." Not
[51:14] that those childish things were wrong or
[51:17] bad, but he had come to a different
[51:19] season of life
[51:22] &gt;&gt; and uh and he had changed. But that is
[51:25] not necessarily the power. Now that's a
[51:28] power that has been put in you.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; But that's not necessarily the power.
[51:34] And I suggest to you it's not the power
[51:36] that God is talking about when the
[51:38] prophet says the power of
[51:40] transformation.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that now. The
[51:44] power of transformation. Who, where,
[51:47] when, where's this power?
[51:51] Well, we shall all be changed. And often
[51:55] we put put that into the future. But I
[51:58] want to say to you, we are being
[52:01] changed.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; And if the living word of God,
[52:07] which he has sent down and is being
[52:11] spoken, it doesn't it makes no
[52:13] difference what kind of a vessel it
[52:15] comes in. But if we give a due honor and
[52:20] due due respect and we say as far as I'm
[52:23] concerned that's you almighty God. You
[52:27] are the holy one of Israel.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; You're the almighty. You're the creator
[52:32] of heavens and earth. You have spoken.
[52:35] You raised up Jesus from the dead. The
[52:38] tomb is empty. And I when I say he
[52:41] lives, he lives. I know he lives because
[52:44] he's made a change in me. Not just that
[52:48] I quit smoking or quit drinking or those
[52:50] things because we've had a prophet
[52:52] saying that that is not the sin. Those
[52:55] are the attributes of sin. But the the
[52:58] sin is unbelief. But you have almighty
[53:02] God. I don't even know why I believe but
[53:05] I believe.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; I believe what you have sent. I believe
[53:09] what other people disdain and where
[53:12] they're critical about and they care
[53:15] nothing for it. But somehow I believe
[53:17] it. Why do you believe it? Because
[53:20] that's the power that God is speaking
[53:23] about.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; You believe it because you believe it.
[53:27] You may not even explain it. Jesus said
[53:30] he spoke to the disciples. They didn't
[53:33] know why they believed it, but they
[53:35] believed it
[53:36] &gt;&gt; and they couldn't explain it. The
[53:38] prophet says they could not explain it
[53:40] but they believed it.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; I just want to fix that in your heart
[53:45] and in your soul and in your mind. You
[53:48] can believe something that you cannot
[53:52] explain. You can't explain why a
[53:54] bumblebee that is too heavy to fly and
[53:57] his wings are not uh the size that they
[54:00] should be and so on and so forth.
[54:03] Everybody flies very well. Outside of uh
[54:07] outside of our window, we have a
[54:09] hummingbird feeder.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Those hummingbirds, they come and they
[54:14] drink that uh almost solid.
[54:19] I won't say solid, it's liquid, but it's
[54:22] very, very sweet. When I see my wife
[54:24] make it, I mean, I hate to think I
[54:28] couldn't have that like that. It is so
[54:31] sweet.
[54:33] just sugar and water and they lap that
[54:36] up. But I I and I I do say I said, you
[54:40] know, I think they've used it all up.
[54:41] They come and fly in there at
[54:45] uh their wings beating at at so many
[54:48] times a second and they fly. I mean,
[54:51] they got helicopters beat all hollow.
[54:54] They go forward and forward and backward
[54:57] and whichever way and they'll take it
[54:59] and they're so nervous. I would be too
[55:02] if I had that kind of food. My They just
[55:05] sit there and they're looking all
[55:06] around. They take a lick and then they
[55:08] look around and and then then they leap
[55:11] up and zoom, they're gone. I tell you
[55:13] what, I don't know how many times their
[55:15] wings have to fly when they go up into
[55:18] the tree. But why do they do that?
[55:20] They're hum They're they're
[55:21] hummingbirds.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; We call them our Hummers.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Boy, they can hum. They just And my wife
[55:30] goes out there and she she'll think
[55:33] about them before she thinks about my
[55:35] breakfast.
[55:38] She'll go out there and she says, "I got
[55:41] to knock the snow off of the railing
[55:44] because I got to get the hummingbird
[55:46] feed." She said, "I think that thing's
[55:47] frozen." So she comes in and thaws it
[55:51] all out and pours fresh in there and
[55:54] goes out there and she'll just give a
[55:56] couple of whistles.
[55:58] Now, my wife's not the world's best
[56:01] whistler, but she gives a couple of
[56:04] little whistles, and they come zooming
[56:06] out of the trees, wherever they come
[56:08] from, and they they know that the
[56:12] hummingbird feeder is fixed, and it's
[56:15] not frozen anymore.
[56:17] Isn't that wonderful?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; What made them like that? I don't know.
[56:21] God made them like that. No one we can
[56:24] figure out and study them for years and
[56:26] we are amazed at their colors. And
[56:30] brother Steve Meyer from Hudson Hope, I
[56:34] mean you you you might say these people
[56:36] are very very
[56:39] near to the earth, but he's told me
[56:41] things and he has his binoculars and he
[56:44] has to look at the birds. He's not
[56:47] interested in a whole lot of sites in
[56:49] Vancouver, but he wants to see the
[56:51] birds. And he was telling me, uh,
[56:54] Brother Tim, that he says these
[56:57] beautiful uh, designs that you see and
[57:02] the colors. He said it takes all of uh,
[57:05] all the feathers, one on top of another
[57:08] to make that color. and the design of
[57:11] one
[57:13] one feather, the other one overlays it
[57:16] and another one overlays it and you need
[57:19] them all in order to make the design of
[57:22] that bird. And I thought that was just
[57:24] so amazing. Here's someone from Hudson
[57:26] Hope is telling me something I didn't
[57:28] learn in school. Hey teachers,
[57:31] you know there's a lot of things we can
[57:33] learn
[57:36] and you just hang on to your seats. I'm
[57:38] going to talk about gifted children in a
[57:40] few minutes.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; That's going to be exciting.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; One is born with talents
[57:57] or gifts
[57:59] and have a teacher or mentor or coach to
[58:04] identify the ability. Where did the
[58:06] ability come from? You know, I have a a
[58:10] daughter here and she would come and
[58:13] stand beside
[58:15] my bed on my side and I don't know if
[58:18] she did this to her mother, but she did
[58:19] it all the time. And she'd come in her
[58:22] little night gown and be tapping and it
[58:27] was it was like the water dripping on a
[58:30] guy's head.
[58:32] Just tap tap tap tap. Finally, I'd open
[58:36] my eyes. I say, "Yes, Marilyn." And she
[58:38] couldn't say her Rs. I'm letting some
[58:41] secrets out now. But she got that from
[58:44] me. I couldn't say my Rs when I was a
[58:46] kid. And uh so she said, "Yes, Marilyn."
[58:51] I said, "What do you need?" Says, "I
[58:53] need a pencil and a paper."
[58:57] Oh, you need a pencil and a paper. Well,
[58:59] she's always needed a pencil and a paper
[59:01] because that was the artist in her that
[59:05] was coming out when she was three years
[59:07] old, three and a half or four years old.
[59:11] But you know what? She needed some
[59:13] schooling and she needed some teachers
[59:19] when uh when we were in Toronto a few
[59:22] years ago. I'm I'm to talk about a
[59:25] living Christ
[59:27] and uh school teachers and principal
[59:31] called for us to come to the school. My
[59:33] wife went I wasn't able to go and they
[59:37] said something is wrong with this child
[59:40] and we'd like you to give her some brain
[59:44] tests.
[59:46] And so we took her down to specialists
[59:50] and they put 22 wires in her head to
[59:53] take some brain wave tests
[59:56] on our daughter. And one of the
[59:59] specialists said she will need glasses
[1:00:02] and she will need hearing aids in both
[1:00:05] ears by the time she's 10 years old. and
[1:00:09] we took her just exact like brother and
[1:00:12] sister Gindo and brought her to the
[1:00:14] front of the service, the West End
[1:00:17] Revival Center where we attended at that
[1:00:20] time. And uh that eventually put us out
[1:00:24] because of the message. But
[1:00:25] nevertheless, God honors faith.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care where it is. He honors
[1:00:31] faith. It could be at a well. It could
[1:00:33] be at a pool. It could be any place. But
[1:00:36] God will honor faith. God will honor fa
[1:00:38] your faith today
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; in this service. Say, and you may not
[1:00:43] understand what's being preached, but he
[1:00:45] he'll honor your faith.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; You need to honor him.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Say, I believe you're alive.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I believe that you're
[1:00:54] here. And furthermore, even though it
[1:00:56] may not look at I believe that you're
[1:00:58] speaking to us now over that pulpit,
[1:01:01] over that piece of wood, I believe
[1:01:03] you're speaking to us. And I accept it
[1:01:05] as that. Yeah. and you'll have what you
[1:01:07] ask.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't want to just come
[1:01:13] to church. We want to see things
[1:01:15] happening.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And we brought her up on a Wednesday
[1:01:22] night service and had her prayed for and
[1:01:25] went back to the same specialists and
[1:01:28] her hearing was perfect.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; She's never had hearing aids.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. never had to have th those
[1:01:35] glasses that they were talking about.
[1:01:37] And furthermore, we finally got led to a
[1:01:40] certain specialist and he said, "Nothing
[1:01:42] wrong with her." He said, "She's
[1:01:45] amidextrous.
[1:01:47] It wouldn't matter to her if she started
[1:01:49] on this side of the page or at the
[1:01:51] bottom and started working up or
[1:01:53] whatever. It's all the same." He said,
[1:01:55] "Have you got her playing the piano?"
[1:01:57] Yes.
[1:01:58] All of our daughters are learning piano.
[1:02:01] He said she can't play the piano. A
[1:02:04] guitar maybe, but not to coordinate her
[1:02:06] hands that that way because and so
[1:02:09] that's just the way it's been. I'll stop
[1:02:11] there, you know. Uh she'll pick pick up
[1:02:15] a pair of scissors and use the left hand
[1:02:17] to cut it and take bread and slice it
[1:02:19] with the right hand. And I don't
[1:02:22] understand it. God makes a person a
[1:02:26] certain way, but then that has to be
[1:02:28] developed
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; and and that is developed and you're
[1:02:32] here as a believer. Unfortunately or
[1:02:35] fortunately, those things, the things
[1:02:38] that you hear, you're not just hearing
[1:02:40] sermons, folks. You're hearing things
[1:02:42] that you must take and develop.
[1:02:53] We we you know Stephen Hawking passed
[1:02:56] away here a few days ago.
[1:02:58] It's such a brilliant mind in such a
[1:03:01] decrepit body
[1:03:04] as it was. I went and saw him here in
[1:03:07] Vancouver. I was always interested in
[1:03:10] things and the universe and so on. And
[1:03:12] he he he was just way over and beyond.
[1:03:20] But that didn't happen by accident.
[1:03:23] He was perhaps you or I can't reach for
[1:03:26] those kind of things. And so I don't
[1:03:28] want to just speak of things that's
[1:03:30] perhaps way beyond you. You might say,
[1:03:33] "Oh, uh, I could never do that." Well,
[1:03:36] there was a little woman. My wife was on
[1:03:38] a bus in Victoria and a woman was
[1:03:42] getting on the bus and she was, I think,
[1:03:45] 102 years old. She was going downtown
[1:03:48] shopping.
[1:03:50] All women like to shop. Doesn't matter
[1:03:52] how old they are. she was going down and
[1:03:55] the bus the bus driver went to help her
[1:03:58] and he says he started to say I I hope
[1:04:02] I'm able to do that you know when I'm uh
[1:04:05] 90 or something and she said young man
[1:04:09] you don't know what you'll do and that's
[1:04:12] what I want to say to the congregation
[1:04:14] here because I'm going to be reading
[1:04:16] about some outstanding people and you
[1:04:18] say oh well I you know that was this
[1:04:20] person that was that person that was the
[1:04:22] other person, you don't know what you'll
[1:04:24] do.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; You don't have to do anything that is
[1:04:27] marvel to the world. You don't have to
[1:04:30] be some great sports star to the world,
[1:04:33] but you may be a star. Let let me talk
[1:04:36] about uh let me talk about gifted
[1:04:39] children just for a moment because I'm
[1:04:42] going to take a little while on it. But
[1:04:45] the children of God
[1:04:47] are gifted children.
[1:04:53] There's certain people that actually
[1:04:55] pack eternal life in them
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; and with them.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me they aren't gifted
[1:05:02] children.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; There are some children that have done a
[1:05:08] lot of bad things and God has simply
[1:05:11] said, "You are forgiven."
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that's not a gifted child.
[1:05:17] Amen.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; You're forgiven.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; And there are some children who've done
[1:05:26] some bad things who their heavenly
[1:05:29] father, not the earthly father, he
[1:05:32] remembers it. And maybe the earthly
[1:05:34] mother remembers it. But the earthly
[1:05:36] father says, "And I have not only
[1:05:38] forgiven you, I have forgotten it."
[1:05:45] Don't tell me they aren't gifted
[1:05:46] children.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; But you may need to develop that a
[1:05:52] little bit.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; You may need to do that. Say, well, the
[1:05:56] first thing I have to do is confess the
[1:05:58] same thing.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And the first thing I have to do is I
[1:06:01] have to forget also like my father
[1:06:04] forgot it. I have to forget it.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; I have to move on from here. Can you say
[1:06:11] amen to that?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Gifted children
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; gift that we're born with.
[1:06:22] You say a career. Well, a career people
[1:06:26] develop things.
[1:06:28] They have to develop it. They have to
[1:06:30] work at it.
[1:06:32] you that are I I see the kids today, you
[1:06:36] young people, I see you with your packs
[1:06:37] sacks
[1:06:40] and you go home with your books and a
[1:06:42] big load of books. I often wonder I say
[1:06:46] that I I'm I'm going to be perfectly
[1:06:48] honest. I say to my wife, "What in the
[1:06:50] world are these kids packing in their
[1:06:52] suitcase? What are they packing in their
[1:06:55] pack backpack?" I hope that you when you
[1:06:58] come to school the next day or two,
[1:07:00] you've got it up here,
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; not on your back,
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; but up here. It's supposed to be
[1:07:06] transferred, isn't it? And it's supposed
[1:07:08] to transfer into your body and so that
[1:07:12] you're acting different and you do
[1:07:14] things different. I have I have a
[1:07:16] brother,
[1:07:20] very dear brother, friend of mine that's
[1:07:21] not here. He's from a black brother from
[1:07:24] Congo.
[1:07:27] But he saw some of our young people here
[1:07:31] and we have a different culture perhaps.
[1:07:33] I don't say it's a good culture.
[1:07:37] I'm not saying it's better.
[1:07:39] But he saw kids at the school here. Walk
[1:07:43] in, open the door, and just walk in.
[1:07:45] Leave an adult coming in behind them.
[1:07:49] He stopped and he said to his son who's
[1:07:52] sitting here said, "Don't you ever
[1:07:55] don't you ever do that.
[1:07:59] Don't you ever go in ahead of an adult.
[1:08:04] You open the door for them because
[1:08:06] that's what they're taught. You open the
[1:08:08] door for them and you let them go on." I
[1:08:12] know when I was a when I was a child, I
[1:08:15] thought as a child, I did as a child,
[1:08:17] but when every once in a while I'd get a
[1:08:19] snap on the side of my head and my dad
[1:08:22] would want me to wake up.
[1:08:26] He wanted me to know that I never called
[1:08:29] anybody by their first name. I'd say Mr.
[1:08:33] Mr. Dodd, Mr. Andes, or Mr. Something.
[1:08:37] That's what we did as young people and
[1:08:40] as children. That was our culture. It's
[1:08:42] not bad. It's okay. It's it's a kind of
[1:08:45] respect. But now you know if we get very
[1:08:49] casual, one thing we want to leave is
[1:08:52] our casual approach outside because when
[1:08:56] you come in, oh God,
[1:09:00] righteous father,
[1:09:03] I so love your presence
[1:09:06] and you want to approach it differently.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; You want to approach it respectfully.
[1:09:12] You know, I was very moved.
[1:09:16] I've got quite a few scriptures here I'm
[1:09:18] going to give. Have we all are are we
[1:09:20] all right for time?
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:09:25] Brother Bram talks about the little
[1:09:26] girl.
[1:09:29] Now, you talk about a gifted child.
[1:09:32] She's just a little girl, but she
[1:09:35] couldn't walk right.
[1:09:37] and she came up and kissed Brother
[1:09:40] Brandham's coat pocket.
[1:09:44] And the next day, she didn't need her
[1:09:47] braces
[1:09:48] and she walked normally.
[1:09:51] And Brother Brandham said she was
[1:09:53] healed.
[1:09:56] She was healed that day when she just
[1:09:59] kissed his pocket because she was
[1:10:02] expressing her respect for the God that
[1:10:06] was in him.
[1:10:08] Not him necessarily, but the God. She
[1:10:11] doesn't know. She just overcome with
[1:10:13] something. So, she does it. And I have
[1:10:16] another example of that same thing, but
[1:10:19] we'll go on.
[1:10:23] Have I made have I made a point yet?
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:10:30] Gifted children, gifts that we were born
[1:10:32] with.
[1:10:34] And I read uh not all children excel in
[1:10:38] academics.
[1:10:40] Some display creative or artistic
[1:10:44] uh artistic or musical and leadership
[1:10:48] abilities. But all of these need to be
[1:10:52] developed.
[1:10:56] A gifted child in the Old Testament.
[1:10:59] There's one.
[1:11:01] Now, I might need some
[1:11:04] young people here. Oh, maybe. Who's 8
[1:11:08] years old?
[1:11:10] Do we have a boy eight years old?
[1:11:16] Anybody eight years old? Nobody in the
[1:11:18] building 8 years old.
[1:11:22] Are you 8 years old?
[1:11:25] Which one?
[1:11:28] We don't have anybody 8 years old. Well,
[1:11:31] there's a boy in the Old Testament.
[1:11:34] He was 8 years old.
[1:11:38] He was born into royalty.
[1:11:42] So, well, I I'm I'm not there. Oh, you
[1:11:45] you don't know.
[1:11:48] I'm born into royalty.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; According to the word of God, according
[1:11:54] to what I believe in my heart. Said,
[1:11:56] "Well, have you got a ticket? Have you
[1:11:57] got a piece of paper?" No, I got
[1:11:59] something bigger than a piece of paper.
[1:12:02] I've been born into royalty. You've been
[1:12:05] born into royalty. This boy was 8 years
[1:12:08] old when he was born into he was born
[1:12:10] into royalty. And when he was eight
[1:12:12] years old, his father had died and he
[1:12:15] became the king. and his name was
[1:12:16] Josiah. That's not the end of it. You
[1:12:20] say that's a gifted child. He was born
[1:12:23] into royalty. No, no, no. God gave him a
[1:12:27] heart
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; and a and a woman who was a prophetess
[1:12:32] sent a word to him and said be and God
[1:12:35] was so angry with Israel and Judah. He
[1:12:40] said he's going to break things down.
[1:12:42] and he's going to he's going to turn his
[1:12:45] back on them and they're going to be
[1:12:47] destroyed and all of these things. But
[1:12:50] she sent a message because there was a
[1:12:53] that boy that was 8 years old when he
[1:12:55] was either 18. It says in the 18th year,
[1:13:00] the Bible says in the 18th year, but it
[1:13:03] might have been the 18th year of his
[1:13:05] reign, which would make him 26.
[1:13:09] So it was between 18 and 26, whatever
[1:13:12] that scripture is referring to. But he
[1:13:16] was he was going past some place,
[1:13:19] journeying past some place, and he saw
[1:13:22] the graves and the tombs of men who were
[1:13:25] away from God. And he began to clean up
[1:13:28] Israel, not a house, but all of Israel.
[1:13:32] He began to clean it up. And he was so
[1:13:35] determined he dug up the bones of the
[1:13:38] old priest that led them wrong and
[1:13:41] crushed those burns to bones to powder
[1:13:44] and burnt them and cast them out and he
[1:13:47] cleansed Israel. And uh the priestess
[1:13:51] the uh prophetess rather she sent word
[1:13:54] says whoever sent this message to you
[1:13:57] take a message back to him that God thus
[1:14:01] sayeth the Lord he will still destroy
[1:14:04] this place he will still destroy these
[1:14:07] this worship and all of these things but
[1:14:10] nevertheless
[1:14:13] because he had a tender heart towards
[1:14:17] God these things will not come to pass
[1:14:20] in his days and he will leave this world
[1:14:23] in peace. I tell you what, friends. And
[1:14:26] when he was 18 years old,
[1:14:29] uh when he was 18 years old, he decided
[1:14:32] that he would have the Passover.
[1:14:35] And listen, I I have the scripture here
[1:14:39] where it speaks of it. It says that
[1:14:42] there never was a Passover from the time
[1:14:46] of the judges in the book of Judges.
[1:14:50] There never was a time all through the
[1:14:53] years of the judges and all through the
[1:14:56] years of the kings. Never was there a
[1:14:59] time where they had a Passover like that
[1:15:02] Passover. And that's a young fellow 18
[1:15:06] to 26 years old, which would include
[1:15:08] most of you here.
[1:15:13] say, "Oh, well, he was royalty. He was a
[1:15:15] king." No, no, no, no.
[1:15:19] I won't accept that.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; You're royalty also.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And the thing is, he just decided
[1:15:26] something needed to be done and he was
[1:15:29] going to do it.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something, friends.
[1:15:36] I'm not just because I'm up here
[1:15:38] preaching.
[1:15:40] You've heard it many times about the
[1:15:42] message that God gave you,
[1:15:45] that God sent this generation.
[1:15:49] God has sent a message to this
[1:15:51] generation
[1:15:52] that your fathers did not have.
[1:15:56] And just a few years ago, they didn't
[1:15:58] have it, but we're too occupied
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; with too many things. My education. What
[1:16:05] do you mean your education? Where's it
[1:16:07] going to go? What's it going to do for
[1:16:09] you?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not opposed to it. Not a bit. Not a
[1:16:13] bit. And we've got school teachers. We
[1:16:16] built a school here. But I can tell you
[1:16:19] one thing. I know that you have devotion
[1:16:22] at the school. But one thing you could
[1:16:24] have which is a lot better which is a
[1:16:27] very important integral part of your
[1:16:30] studies would be to study what a prophet
[1:16:33] of God has said about this age and
[1:16:36] believe it
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; and determine that uh I'm not only here
[1:16:41] to learn to be a a pilot or to be
[1:16:44] whatever but I'm also learning to be a a
[1:16:48] witness. Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You shall receive power."
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of power he's talking
[1:16:58] about. And you shall be witnesses unto
[1:17:02] me.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Not witnesses unto a church or just a
[1:17:06] way of belief or or someone else, but
[1:17:09] you'll be a witness to me
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; whether you believe it or not.
[1:17:18] I'm going to speak it.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; That was a gifted child.
[1:17:26] Josiah was a gifted child.
[1:17:30] You say, "Well," and I knew while I was
[1:17:33] studying that people are people are
[1:17:36] inclined to, "Oh, just put that off
[1:17:38] someplace." Oh, that's
[1:17:42] We've got some people in the world that
[1:17:44] are gifted in sports.
[1:17:47] And I read about them and I've I've
[1:17:50] heard of of them how they get up in the
[1:17:52] morning and go I have a cousin. She
[1:17:56] lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan,
[1:17:59] and it it'd be so cold there, 30° below
[1:18:03] zero or whatever more. But she had to
[1:18:06] take her boys to hockey.
[1:18:09] and she she had five sons, I think two
[1:18:13] sets of twins,
[1:18:15] and she would go to hockey. She told me
[1:18:18] that I would leave the car running
[1:18:20] outside because in the middle of the
[1:18:23] night just so she could put bring some
[1:18:26] home, get them to bed, and then she had
[1:18:28] to get up early in the wee hours of the
[1:18:31] morning and get the others out of bed
[1:18:34] and take them to hockey training. I
[1:18:37] don't know. Did they become stars? I
[1:18:39] don't know. I doubt it. I don't imagine.
[1:18:41] But that's what she did as a mother. She
[1:18:43] put all that effort and all that into
[1:18:46] them and they did all of that practice
[1:18:48] and everything else. Well, I will say
[1:18:51] this. It would be a lot better to have
[1:18:53] put it into the gospel somehow.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; I would like a amen out of this
[1:18:59] congregation.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; I thought of you, brother Matthew. I
[1:19:04] thought of the uh the Daz
[1:19:09] I think Michael or was it Michael went
[1:19:12] to you went to Turkey with all right
[1:19:16] with brother Mark Alo
[1:19:20] you know there's nothing wrong with
[1:19:22] putting a shell in the bullet or a
[1:19:24] bullet in the gun and it doesn't fire
[1:19:27] there's nothing wrong with trying to do
[1:19:29] things I have tried to do things
[1:19:33] I've put a lot of emphasis on people and
[1:19:37] some of it uh they you know maybe really
[1:19:41] became uh something and others perhaps
[1:19:45] let it go. But on the other hand it
[1:19:48] doesn't it doesn't hinder uh us to live
[1:19:52] the life that others can look to and be
[1:19:56] influenced by it.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] There was another gifted child
[1:20:05] and he was seven or eight years old.
[1:20:11] He was carrying water
[1:20:14] in two syrup buckets.
[1:20:17] And that's not so long ago.
[1:20:21] He was carrying water to his father's
[1:20:25] still. He was making alcohol.
[1:20:28] Now, that's not a very respectable thing
[1:20:31] perhaps for a a churchgoing boy, but his
[1:20:36] parents were Catholic and they were not
[1:20:39] religious, he said.
[1:20:41] And he's carrying water.
[1:20:45] You'd say, "What kind of training is
[1:20:46] that?"
[1:20:48] Carrying water to his father's still.
[1:20:52] And it's a quiet day.
[1:20:55] And uh there's a popular tree
[1:20:59] and uh leaves start to move.
[1:21:03] Listen friends, I'm going to tell you
[1:21:05] something that you have not heard.
[1:21:10] And that boy heard a voice in the tree
[1:21:14] said, "Don't drink or smoke or defile
[1:21:18] your body in any way. When you're older,
[1:21:22] I have a work for you to do." Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that he's not a gifted
[1:21:28] child,
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Who knew he was a gifted child?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; A teacher who could teach him knew
[1:21:42] he was a gifted child. I'm going to take
[1:21:44] you and use you. How do you know who you
[1:21:48] are? You may be here visiting,
[1:21:52] but God knew you'd be here in this
[1:21:54] service. And he wanted you to hear what
[1:21:56] I am saying to this congregation and to
[1:22:00] those that are streaming. We don't know.
[1:22:02] Yes, we've got to be, you know, we've
[1:22:05] got to be plumbers and carpenters and
[1:22:07] mothers and whatever more. We've got to
[1:22:10] be that. We But you don't know who's
[1:22:12] looking at you and you don't know who
[1:22:15] who you're affecting.
[1:22:17] You are affecting and influencing
[1:22:20] somebody.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; And how do you know who he who keeps the
[1:22:28] books?
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says this, it's required
[1:22:33] of a servant that he be found faithful.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Doesn't doesn't say you got to be
[1:22:41] successful.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; So you got to be found faithful. The
[1:22:45] world is so inclined to push and push
[1:22:50] and push people almost over the edge.
[1:22:52] You know, they've got to be successful
[1:22:54] and they've got to meet certain budgets
[1:22:56] and they've got to meet certain uh
[1:22:59] certain levels of uh they've got to
[1:23:02] attain certain things. But I say one
[1:23:05] thing. If you can come before God and
[1:23:08] you can just kneel and say,
[1:23:11] "I did my very best for you.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; I talked I taught my children.
[1:23:21] I was a mother." I said to my wife the
[1:23:24] other day,
[1:23:29] maybe she doesn't feel she had a high
[1:23:32] IQ.
[1:23:34] But she says, "How do you know about an
[1:23:35] IQ?
[1:23:37] So many things I didn't learn."
[1:23:40] And I've never worked. She worked before
[1:23:43] I was married to her. She was a legal
[1:23:47] steno for two lawyers,
[1:23:51] but she never carried on with that
[1:23:53] because we got married.
[1:23:57] And I said,
[1:24:00] "What kind of value do you have?"
[1:24:04] Who has attained to motherhood?
[1:24:08] You've attained to motherhood. You've
[1:24:10] been mother.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And from somehow, for some reason, I
[1:24:15] know nothing about it, but almighty God
[1:24:18] saw that your daughters would be here
[1:24:20] with you.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; That you would worship with them.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Where do we put the value? How do we
[1:24:28] evaluate these things?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Is that a gifted child or is not gifted?
[1:24:34] It makes no difference because at the
[1:24:36] end of the road, you want him. You want
[1:24:38] to hear him say, "Well done, thou good
[1:24:42] and faithful servant." Doesn't matter
[1:24:45] whether we just ho the field or ho the
[1:24:48] potatoes or the garden or whatever, but
[1:24:51] we were faithful to the call of God in
[1:24:54] our lives and faithful to our place.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It may be nothing more than
[1:25:01] sitting in the house of God and you're
[1:25:04] always here and you sit in the house of
[1:25:07] God and you always are testifying that
[1:25:11] what I believe and a this message I
[1:25:14] believe in and this person I believe in
[1:25:18] is something that's divine
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; and respected as such.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Now I'm just started.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:25:28] I'm not going to drag this out.
[1:25:31] I'll be watching my time.
[1:25:36] And this young person who I said was
[1:25:39] bringing his
[1:25:44] his father, alcoholic father,
[1:25:52] water for his still.
[1:25:55] He also stood in the motel room with me
[1:26:00] and now you're looking at the person and
[1:26:02] he said, "Brother Eddie,"
[1:26:05] he said, "if you asked me what I would
[1:26:08] sooner have
[1:26:11] five minutes with my daddy
[1:26:14] or have gold bricks
[1:26:19] stacked from the floor to the ceiling of
[1:26:21] this room."
[1:26:23] He said, "I would sooner have five
[1:26:25] minutes with my daddy."
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; And yet,
[1:26:32] I don't know about his father. I don't
[1:26:34] know. I know that he was an alcoholic.
[1:26:36] And maybe maybe the prophet prayed with
[1:26:39] him, I believe, before he passed away.
[1:26:42] But this is what I said I would tell you
[1:26:45] so you won't have to remind me.
[1:26:48] When brother Brandham was a young man,
[1:26:50] like you young men here,
[1:26:53] he went with a young girl,
[1:26:56] he calls it his girlfriend.
[1:26:59] Brother Brandham has this picture taken
[1:27:01] with her daddy.
[1:27:05] It's actually on the internet, and I'm
[1:27:07] sure that many don't know, but he went
[1:27:08] with a young lady,
[1:27:11] and that young lady was the one who
[1:27:13] tried to get him to smoke.
[1:27:18] And Sister Biscll and I were in Florida
[1:27:23] and the pastor of the church said,
[1:27:25] "Would you like to meet Brother
[1:27:27] Brennan's girlfriend?"
[1:27:29] I said, "I certainly would."
[1:27:32] He said, "Well, we'll go and get her."
[1:27:35] And a short time later in came
[1:27:38] a elderly woman
[1:27:42] and we sat with her and faced her. I
[1:27:47] said, "Did you
[1:27:50] did you know that brother Brandham was a
[1:27:53] prophet of God?" "No."
[1:27:57] She said, "We didn't."
[1:28:00] And maybe that's why you're here.
[1:28:04] She said he did tell us that he
[1:28:07] that he'd hear voices in the trees
[1:28:11] that would speak to him.
[1:28:18] And I said, "Well,
[1:28:20] would you like to receive Jesus Christ?"
[1:28:24] "Yes," she said, "I would."
[1:28:27] I said, "I'll pray with you."
[1:28:32] One of the great one of the great
[1:28:36] events of my life was able to lead her
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; to Jesus Christ.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; And I thought right away of the words,
[1:28:48] "All that I loved
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; and all that loved me."
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And she opened up her purse
[1:28:55] and took out a picture.
[1:28:58] has a picture of Brother Brandham in a
[1:29:01] heart in a heart piece of like showboard
[1:29:07] small like that. And she held it in her
[1:29:09] hands
[1:29:12] and she looked past my head, looked over
[1:29:14] me, looking into some distant place
[1:29:19] and said, "I still love him."
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; I thought that was remarkable.
[1:29:30] and she wanted to come to the service
[1:29:32] that evening and be prayed for for some
[1:29:35] physical ailment as well.
[1:29:38] and and I think she's gone now, but I
[1:29:42] had a picture I have a picture of her
[1:29:44] father and I thought that he was uh
[1:29:49] I thought that he was brother u
[1:29:53] who's that brother Brandham talked about
[1:29:57] the old brother that always was with
[1:29:59] him.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Bosworth Bosworth Yes. I thought it was
[1:30:06] brother Bosworth
[1:30:09] but it turned out to be her dad.
[1:30:16] Now he went with this girl
[1:30:21] but that gift
[1:30:25] and he brother Brown tells about he came
[1:30:27] back and he says
[1:30:30] his girl was smoking
[1:30:34] and she told me while I sat there she
[1:30:36] said I tried to get him to smoke.
[1:30:39] She's just confirming the message.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; I tried to get him to smoke, but she
[1:30:45] said he wouldn't. And then we moved to
[1:30:48] Arizona
[1:30:50] and he followed us to Arizona.
[1:30:54] Now, friends, I'm telling you this just
[1:30:58] because it's necessary for you to let
[1:31:01] brother Brandham be a man. Also,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; don't elevate it to some place that
[1:31:08] don't elevate.
[1:31:11] You can't elevate it more than God did.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; He was the messenger to the age.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; And no one else can take that place. God
[1:31:21] gave him the highest position of anyone
[1:31:24] that walked on the face of the earth, I
[1:31:26] would say, since Jesus. There are other
[1:31:28] great people.
[1:31:32] But from Genesis
[1:31:34] 1 and two
[1:31:37] to Easter Sunday 2018,
[1:31:41] a bride formed out of this churning
[1:31:46] mass.
[1:31:48] We could study this mass of darkness
[1:31:51] which you have to live amongst
[1:31:54] and that won't do anything for us. But
[1:31:57] when you realize that the one I'm
[1:31:59] speaking of, God
[1:32:02] picked you out of this churning mass and
[1:32:06] said, "You are going to be a part of my
[1:32:11] body."
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; You furthermore are going to be part of
[1:32:15] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. There isn't
[1:32:20] another person on the earth that can
[1:32:23] give you that place.
[1:32:25] Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; God himself.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Am I preaching over your head?
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Am I making it too exotic? No, I don't
[1:32:34] think so. I'm saying you talk about
[1:32:37] gifted people.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; And you hear a lot of messages over this
[1:32:42] pulpit of telling you who you are.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends. You
[1:32:49] may not you may not make a big mark in
[1:32:52] the world, but I will say one thing. If
[1:32:55] you just live solidly for Jesus Christ,
[1:32:59] you make a mark wherever you are
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; in this world and you have been a
[1:33:05] success. You have been you will hear the
[1:33:08] words. And I'm going to say over this
[1:33:10] pulpit, you will hear the words, well
[1:33:14] done.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; You might say, well, when was it? When
[1:33:18] did I feed the poor? When did I do this?
[1:33:21] When? You don't know when you're doing
[1:33:23] it.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Somebody may be looking at you, watching
[1:33:28] you during the week
[1:33:31] and you're influencing
[1:33:33] someone.
[1:33:35] Then I
[1:33:37] now I I thought I was a fearful that I
[1:33:40] might This is brother Tim. what I was
[1:33:43] talking about.
[1:33:46] When a person gives themselves
[1:33:50] to God
[1:33:52] and they're in their place, they may
[1:33:55] just be a mother or a father doing
[1:33:59] dishes or whatever more and influencing
[1:34:03] another life into the right pathway, the
[1:34:07] pathway of God. Is that the power of God
[1:34:10] or is it the power of man? I say it's
[1:34:14] the power of God.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; And that person gives themselves and
[1:34:19] surrenders themselves under the correct
[1:34:22] life example that God placed in front of
[1:34:26] them. Then that person is receiving the
[1:34:30] gift of God. and they are a gifted
[1:34:33] person that they even have a a a sense
[1:34:36] to accept that and receive that
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; as Charles
[1:34:44] uh Wesley's father said on his deathbed
[1:34:49] I believe it was he said it's the inner
[1:34:52] witness son the inner witness
[1:34:56] you might say well that wasn't a great
[1:34:58] sermon it's not great sermons that get
[1:35:02] great people.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; It's simple things that have been said
[1:35:06] to them. It's the inner witness. And I
[1:35:08] want to say to you,
[1:35:10] friends are here.
[1:35:13] You might be enticed a certain direction
[1:35:15] or to make a a decision that isn't
[1:35:18] exactly correct, but it's the inner
[1:35:20] witness. And if you listen to your
[1:35:23] heart, the Holy Spirit is faithful to
[1:35:26] tell us what is right.
[1:35:29] Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham refers to Genesis the
[1:35:35] first chapter. Excuse me, I want to
[1:35:38] hurry along here. And he says the spirit
[1:35:41] of God moved upon the face of the
[1:35:44] waters. We realize that the water and he
[1:35:48] said the Bible said in the beginning
[1:35:50] back there uh that that this the world
[1:35:55] was without form and void and was void.
[1:36:00] There was nothing but just a darkness of
[1:36:03] chaos.
[1:36:06] And while I read that I I said to
[1:36:08] myself,
[1:36:10] that's where we're at.
[1:36:13] This mass of humanity
[1:36:15] that crawls over the face of the earth
[1:36:19] over 7 billion people is nothing but a
[1:36:23] mass of chaos.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; People are lost. They don't know where
[1:36:28] they're going.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; They'll reach at this and reach at that.
[1:36:31] And Satan has has sent and he has used
[1:36:35] all the technology that he has derived
[1:36:38] from the tree of knowledge. And he sends
[1:36:41] all of his perversion throughout all the
[1:36:44] world.
[1:36:46] Friends, we're here in a church, but
[1:36:48] we're not to act like saints. That that
[1:36:51] doesn't touch us. You know that you see
[1:36:53] it. You know that you hear it. It's in
[1:36:56] the magazines. It's in the newspaper.
[1:36:58] It's on the radio. And wherever you are,
[1:37:01] you see it on the streets. People are
[1:37:04] lost.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; And they talk about this crisis and that
[1:37:09] crisis. Who created the crisis? Where
[1:37:12] did it come from? The opiad opiad crisis
[1:37:16] and all that drug addiction and the
[1:37:18] hundreds that have died here in We don't
[1:37:21] have to talk about hell. We're talking
[1:37:23] about it right here in our city. This
[1:37:25] city of Vancouver, one of the worst
[1:37:27] spots in the country. What is it? It's a
[1:37:30] mass of darkness.
[1:37:33] a a mass of lost darkness as the prophet
[1:37:36] said of of the earth that we're standing
[1:37:39] on. This earth was nothing but a mass
[1:37:42] loss of darkness
[1:37:44] spinning off into space until until it
[1:37:48] came under the influence of the word of
[1:37:51] God. Listen, you're sitting here today
[1:37:54] and you are under the influence of the
[1:37:57] spoken word of almighty God and you are
[1:38:00] being changed. You are being transformed
[1:38:04] by that word and made into sons and
[1:38:07] daughters of God.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; In fact is when we take on we hear of
[1:38:11] the change of the body. When you take on
[1:38:14] the change of the body that'll be a very
[1:38:16] small step.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; The last step's a very small step. The
[1:38:22] rest of it is now. Now we're being
[1:38:25] changed. Now we're being transformed.
[1:38:29] Now we're under the influence of the
[1:38:32] power of transformation.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the prophet of God has
[1:38:37] just made us aware of it. What is
[1:38:40] happening? I can tell you that this
[1:38:42] message is the power of God.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; To the transforming
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; of you as an individual. Give yourself
[1:38:51] to it. I don't have any
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; I don't have any apology for that.
[1:39:08] He said, "And what a horrible shape it
[1:39:11] must have been in.
[1:39:13] Nothing but way into the darkness yonder
[1:39:17] without light or anything. You can say
[1:39:21] that was me.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; That was me. I was out there.
[1:39:26] I was out in the darkness
[1:39:29] just uh not knowing where I was going,
[1:39:32] not knowing why I was here.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the churning of the
[1:39:38] water
[1:39:40] and that wandering star twisted around
[1:39:43] and around the orbits out there
[1:39:46] somewhere. It must have been a
[1:39:48] terrifying terrific mass of something
[1:39:51] lost like it was. couldn't find its way.
[1:39:56] And now he said this, I've highlighted
[1:39:59] it. And that's what we become when we
[1:40:04] become wandering stars away from God.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Just without hope, without God, without
[1:40:13] just a churning around out in the
[1:40:15] darkness, not knowing when and where
[1:40:20] we're going. I want to announce to you,
[1:40:23] I'm not just caught in the emotion of
[1:40:26] this moment. I want to announce to you
[1:40:28] this God.
[1:40:31] This God, this holy one of Israel, this
[1:40:35] holy God that created all things,
[1:40:40] gave you life,
[1:40:42] knew who your mother and father were
[1:40:44] going to be, has brought you here, but
[1:40:48] he called you for a divine purpose.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:54] You're a gifted child.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; You'll need to recognize that to get the
[1:41:02] rest of my message.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; I want to speak about another gifted
[1:41:09] child.
[1:41:13] I got a picture of him here.
[1:41:22] You don't know his name, but I'll give
[1:41:24] you his name and you'll know him right
[1:41:25] away. Hudson Taylor.
[1:41:28] How many here have ever heard of Hudson
[1:41:30] Taylor? Hold your hand up high, please.
[1:41:38] The rest of you,
[1:41:40] I'm introducing him to you. This is
[1:41:43] Hudson Taylor.
[1:41:48] This is somewhere between the boy
[1:41:51] carrying the two little buckets
[1:41:55] of water syrup pales
[1:41:58] to his father's
[1:42:01] whiskey still.
[1:42:05] This man here, Hudson Taylor,
[1:42:09] when he was 17. Who's 17?
[1:42:15] Is there anybody 17?
[1:42:20] Stand up. You'll be a good one to stand
[1:42:22] up. Abraham.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Abraham Wong.
[1:42:27] I don't know if Hudson Taylor had a
[1:42:29] daddy like you have. Thank you, Abraham.
[1:42:34] He was your age when he decided
[1:42:39] he was 17 years old when he decided
[1:42:44] he needed to go to China.
[1:42:47] He arrived in Shanghai, China,
[1:42:51] when he was about
[1:42:53] 20 or 21.
[1:42:57] He spent 51 years in China.
[1:43:01] He went there 11 times.
[1:43:06] He learned
[1:43:08] Greek,
[1:43:11] Latin,
[1:43:13] Mandarin.
[1:43:16] He translated the Bible also
[1:43:19] best that he could and I have nothing to
[1:43:22] say about that. He labored incredibly
[1:43:27] was very sick and had to come back. And
[1:43:30] about the same time there was another
[1:43:32] gifted child and I will
[1:43:36] I doubt that you know much about him.
[1:43:40] His name was CT Stud.
[1:43:46] But he was a star. He was a sports star.
[1:43:53] He played on a national team for cricket
[1:43:57] in England. His father was a wealthy
[1:44:01] wealthy man. He was what was called a
[1:44:04] country gentleman.
[1:44:06] Had a large estate with raceh horses and
[1:44:10] this kind of thing.
[1:44:12] And when he gave himself, listen
[1:44:16] friends,
[1:44:18] he wasn't born there. He committed
[1:44:21] himself
[1:44:23] to god's direction
[1:44:26] and to listen to God's voice.
[1:44:29] and he just became consumed with the
[1:44:31] kingdom of God, not the kingdom of
[1:44:34] earth. I want to move you from the
[1:44:37] kingdom of this world. It's all destiny
[1:44:40] for ashes.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Don't give your life for ashes.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; You're worth something more than ashes.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; preacher.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; He also was a gifted child,
[1:44:56] gifted by this world's standards. He
[1:45:00] went to the fine college
[1:45:03] and his father was a wealthy man. His
[1:45:06] father died and left him all his wealth.
[1:45:09] You know what he did? He gave it all
[1:45:11] away.
[1:45:16] He just gave it away.
[1:45:19] That's what he felt to do. And you if
[1:45:21] you read some of the proverbs of
[1:45:24] of CT stud,
[1:45:27] it'll sting you.
[1:45:30] These are not men of the ancient past.
[1:45:33] These are not men of the Old Testament.
[1:45:36] These are men in a generation just a
[1:45:38] generation or two ago. In fact, these
[1:45:41] are men both Hudson Taylor and CT stud
[1:45:44] are men of the generation just past
[1:45:48] which brother Brandham called the age of
[1:45:50] the open door. And they were obsessed
[1:45:54] with the spirit that was on them for
[1:45:56] that age. We can't replicate or
[1:45:59] duplicate that. We're called perhaps for
[1:46:02] something else.
[1:46:04] Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; And when you see burdened someone's
[1:46:09] burdened,
[1:46:12] that is why perhaps I am so attracted
[1:46:16] not with admiration
[1:46:19] to brother Murphy.
[1:46:22] I see a man that travels. I see a man
[1:46:26] that gives his life. The least we can
[1:46:28] do, the very least we can do is pray.
[1:46:31] Amen. The
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; very least we can do is pray and give.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; What we do in this life won't amount to
[1:46:42] a whole lot. And I can I can tell you
[1:46:44] this now because I faced the other side.
[1:46:50] I know what I'm talking about.
[1:46:53] And I have received letters
[1:46:58] that I didn't know. I don't know the
[1:47:00] people yet I one I have met as a young
[1:47:03] man
[1:47:06] but I have received letters that said we
[1:47:08] stream
[1:47:10] the services of Cloverdale Bible way and
[1:47:14] our confidence he says what you do there
[1:47:18] I and a number of churches he's a pastor
[1:47:21] he said a number of churches here in
[1:47:23] South Africa if we see you do it we do
[1:47:26] the same thing if you start doing
[1:47:29] something we do that that didn't make me
[1:47:32] feel great. I was thankful but I want to
[1:47:36] say this to you friends. It's just
[1:47:38] wonderful if you can say father
[1:47:42] or friend
[1:47:44] your footsteps
[1:47:46] have have inclined mine and I have been
[1:47:51] moved. I'm very very attached to the one
[1:47:55] that you have given yourself to. I've
[1:47:58] given myself. I see that it's
[1:48:00] worthwhile. And I want to say something
[1:48:03] to this congregation. And perhaps that
[1:48:05] might not register with everybody, but I
[1:48:09] want to say to everybody in this
[1:48:11] congregation and those of you that are
[1:48:13] on the on the internet, if you want the
[1:48:17] blessing of God,
[1:48:20] find out what God has blessed.
[1:48:23] If you want the blessing of God, and I
[1:48:26] was not a very smart person, but I began
[1:48:29] to realize that God was blessing this
[1:48:33] message.
[1:48:35] [Applause]
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; He had sent his word.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; And and I cannot tell you, you may sit
[1:48:41] here and listen to me, friends, but I
[1:48:44] want you to absorb this. Please absorb
[1:48:47] this. God when he sent out his word and
[1:48:51] he knew that he was going to take that
[1:48:52] churning mass of darkness and bring it
[1:48:56] into a a beautiful Eden and the prophet
[1:49:00] speaks about and bring it into that kind
[1:49:04] of life.
[1:49:06] Now he sees a mass of
[1:49:09] billions of people
[1:49:13] in such idolatry
[1:49:16] and such darkness.
[1:49:18] But he's going to send out his word and
[1:49:21] tell his spirit
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; and send his spirit you're going to
[1:49:25] brood over these people. I have my sons
[1:49:30] and daughters are out there.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:35] and you must find them and you must
[1:49:39] brood over them and they're going to
[1:49:41] come.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that the one who's given
[1:49:45] his life to be a witness to be a
[1:49:48] testimony
[1:49:50] to to these people and we don't know who
[1:49:53] they are. Might be your neighbor. It
[1:49:56] might be someone across the sea. I don't
[1:49:58] know who they are.
[1:50:01] Brother Tim, Brother John. That's why we
[1:50:04] preach.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; And I've told you here before, but I'll
[1:50:12] tell it once again.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; And I have to admit and confess
[1:50:19] that I was I have been all my life from
[1:50:23] a young man
[1:50:25] in my late teens.
[1:50:28] I had a phrase that my wife said, I
[1:50:31] didn't hear it
[1:50:33] from other and I can tell you I didn't
[1:50:36] learn it in school. I didn't learn it
[1:50:38] from my peers. I didn't learn it. But I
[1:50:42] remember saying it. I just said, "I just
[1:50:44] love the word of God."
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; It would speak to me.
[1:50:50] And I'd see myself. I was just an
[1:50:52] average
[1:50:54] almost like a homeless guy.
[1:50:57] I just see
[1:51:00] I I I I felt connected with those
[1:51:03] people. I felt and as I heard now
[1:51:06] brother Brandham say just stand on the
[1:51:10] side of the path. See where you'd stand
[1:51:14] when the Lord Jesus was here.
[1:51:17] Friends, the foxes have holes and the
[1:51:21] birds of the air have nests, but the son
[1:51:24] of man had nowhere to lay his head.
[1:51:29] He knows what the darkness and mass is.
[1:51:32] And he sent his spirit out and his
[1:51:36] spirit is under a commission.
[1:51:38] Find them,
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; brood over them
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; until you bring them out of the darkness
[1:51:47] and shape them
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; and mold them
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; into a bride.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Mold them into this kind of a life.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; And friends, that's exactly what's
[1:52:01] happening.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what's taking place.
[1:52:05] And I want to say to you without any
[1:52:07] hesitation,
[1:52:11] you're a gifted person.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Almighty God,
[1:52:17] who could have had the stars, could have
[1:52:20] had some glorious thing, but he said,
[1:52:23] "No, I want a family.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; I want a family,
[1:52:30] and I'm going to I'm going to
[1:52:32] predestinate. I'm going to ordain
[1:52:35] how they even come and they'll come.
[1:52:38] There's a certain part of me, a certain
[1:52:41] reflection, a certain way. I want to be
[1:52:45] seen. I want to be felt.
[1:52:50] And friends,
[1:52:52] friends,
[1:52:54] that's why we get moved by certain
[1:52:57] things. We get affected by certain
[1:53:01] things. And we are here for one purpose,
[1:53:04] to affect the people godly. But I have
[1:53:07] been obsessed all my life. If this
[1:53:10] message could answer the questions that
[1:53:13] were in my heart, somebody else has to
[1:53:17] hear it. Somebody else has the same
[1:53:20] question. Amen.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Do you think that is too
[1:53:28] is that being too
[1:53:31] severe?
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; I I think it's try. Someone else has the
[1:53:34] same question.
[1:53:49] It's 12:30, so I'm going to close right
[1:53:51] away.
[1:53:56] You might say, "Well,
[1:53:58] you've talked for over an hour now.
[1:54:06] What do I actually do when I leave these
[1:54:08] doors?"
[1:54:10] Well, I'll tell you what to do. I'll
[1:54:13] tell you what to do because the Bible
[1:54:16] which we read tell us what to do.
[1:54:20] Our minds
[1:54:22] need to be renewed.
[1:54:30] Be transformed
[1:54:33] by the renewing of your mind.
[1:54:37] We can't put that off in someone else.
[1:54:39] You have a mind.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; We have a mind. You have some thoughts.
[1:54:46] And I don't care what you think about
[1:54:48] the preaching. We're not interested in
[1:54:50] the style of preaching right now. And
[1:54:53] we're not we're we're interested in what
[1:54:54] God has said in his word. Be ye
[1:54:58] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:55:01] mind. That's not some idol words. Those
[1:55:04] are true words. Those are sent to
[1:55:07] certain people.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; This man who we had up on the screen,
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; he arrived, I'd see I had it here.
[1:55:22] If I can't find it.
[1:55:25] Yes. Hudson Taylor. He spent 51 years in
[1:55:29] China.
[1:55:31] The society that he began
[1:55:34] with respons was responsible for
[1:55:37] bringing over
[1:55:39] 800
[1:55:41] missionaries to China
[1:55:46] who began 125 schools
[1:55:53] and directly resulted in 18,000
[1:55:58] Christian conversions
[1:56:00] as well as the establishment of more
[1:56:02] than 300 stations of work and with more
[1:56:08] than 500 local helpers in all 18
[1:56:13] provinces.
[1:56:16] That was that man.
[1:56:19] And CT Stud met him over in China and
[1:56:23] became involved went to India and then
[1:56:26] finally went to Congo and he died in the
[1:56:28] Belgian Congo for you people that are
[1:56:31] here from the Congo.
[1:56:33] CT Stud who was very very close
[1:56:40] would say well these men have done
[1:56:43] incredible things
[1:56:46] you don't know what we do you don't know
[1:56:48] what you have done
[1:56:56] you know I look personally I look
[1:56:59] my daughters have had an effect on me.
[1:57:03] People of the church have had an effect
[1:57:05] on me.
[1:57:07] Sometime the person who might feel they
[1:57:09] are the least in the in the body of
[1:57:12] Christ
[1:57:14] have had an effect on me.
[1:57:17] I believe that
[1:57:25] I want to believe that we were able to
[1:57:27] have an effect and and if I was able to
[1:57:31] even have a that's why friends
[1:57:36] please I hope I just can make it clear
[1:57:38] to you
[1:57:40] I wasn't expecting to do some great
[1:57:45] thing in front of in front of William
[1:57:49] Brandham to make him admire us whatever
[1:57:53] more. No, no, that wasn't it.
[1:57:57] It was like the woman in the Bible.
[1:58:00] And she had such an effect upon Elijah
[1:58:02] or Elisha. Elijah, I believe it was. She
[1:58:05] had such an effect.
[1:58:07] Hey,
[1:58:09] she's just a woman. She's looking after
[1:58:12] the house.
[1:58:13] She's saying to her husband,
[1:58:16] "Can't we have a place?
[1:58:19] This is a holy man of God."
[1:58:22] Now, he didn't come and announce to her
[1:58:24] he was holy. He didn't come announce her
[1:58:26] he was a prophet. He just said,
[1:58:28] "Couldn't we have a place where he can
[1:58:30] rest? I see him going by here." And so,
[1:58:33] she has a place.
[1:58:41] Yeah, I'll maybe tell you.
[1:58:45] We had a radio broadcast
[1:58:48] that covered all of United States,
[1:58:52] big parts of Canada
[1:58:54] and southern part of Africa in an area
[1:58:58] inhabited by 87 million people.
[1:59:01] We got a letter here to Cloverdale Bible
[1:59:04] Way and the letter said,
[1:59:08] "We can no longer handle your
[1:59:10] broadcast."
[1:59:15] And
[1:59:16] Brother Roger Smith, who was with us at
[1:59:20] that time and was announcing and doing a
[1:59:23] lot of the ministerial work, he said,
[1:59:26] "What shall we do?" And I said, "Well,
[1:59:29] just wait till I get back and I'll go
[1:59:32] and see him." So I went and saw the
[1:59:34] young man. He actually had been a
[1:59:38] minister's son who was running a company
[1:59:41] and he started out called Christian
[1:59:43] Ministries.
[1:59:44] And he said
[1:59:47] now he'd become a multi-millionaire and
[1:59:49] a very wealthy man himself.
[1:59:54] So he said we have to in a letter we
[1:59:57] have to dis discont continue your
[2:00:01] broadcast.
[2:00:02] It wasn't mean we would be off the air
[2:00:04] but he wouldn't handle it anymore.
[2:00:07] And so I got into the into his office
[2:00:11] and now an office where he was only
[2:00:13] sharing a girl about three years before.
[2:00:16] Now he's got a great big staff
[2:00:20] and I had to wait. They said well you
[2:00:22] have to wait for a little while. He's
[2:00:24] going to be he's on the phone with Jimmy
[2:00:26] Swagert.
[2:00:27] So I was on the phone. I was not on the
[2:00:30] phone. I'm sorry. I sat down and waited
[2:00:32] for him. I waited about an hour and a
[2:00:34] half and finally I got into his office.
[2:00:37] Lovely,
[2:00:38] beautiful furniture, nicer than anything
[2:00:41] here.
[2:00:42] So I sat down,
[2:00:45] said, "I'm sorry, Brother Ed." He always
[2:00:47] called me Brother Ed. said, "I'm sorry
[2:00:49] that I was on the phone with Jimmy
[2:00:52] Swagert."
[2:00:55] And I said, "Well," I said, "I just
[2:00:58] received a letter from you from
[2:01:00] Christian Ministries in Bellingham."
[2:01:04] And he he bowed his head and he shook
[2:01:06] his head. Oh. He said, "I'm so sorry."
[2:01:09] He said, "I'm so sorry that I had to
[2:01:12] send that to you."
[2:01:14] And he said, "I I'll just share
[2:01:16] something with you that no one really
[2:01:18] knows. My family doesn't know." But he
[2:01:21] said, "I'm driving down I5 and
[2:01:23] everything just goes black and I go
[2:01:25] blind from pain in my body and I pull
[2:01:29] off. I had enough presence of mind to
[2:01:32] pull off." And he said, "And uh I was
[2:01:35] under extreme exhaustion."
[2:01:37] and they took me into the hospital and
[2:01:39] the hospital told me
[2:01:42] uh you've got to cancel some of your
[2:01:45] work and he said and I was given a I was
[2:01:49] given a criteria and you fell under that
[2:01:53] and uh so he said that's why I sent that
[2:01:56] to you. I said, 'N no, that's fine.
[2:01:58] That's fine,
[2:02:00] Michael. His name was Michael. I said,
[2:02:01] 'Th That's fine, Michael. I said, I just
[2:02:03] want to give you a testimony.
[2:02:06] I said,
[2:02:08] some years ago,
[2:02:10] I became aware
[2:02:12] that Brother Brandham was a great man of
[2:02:15] God. That's all I knew.
[2:02:18] And I wanted to give him a place where
[2:02:20] he could go and have a rest. And I
[2:02:23] thought northern British Columbia.
[2:02:26] It wasn't a bed now. It wasn't a b p a
[2:02:29] picture of water. It was just a place
[2:02:31] where he could rest.
[2:02:34] I said I and so I invited him and he
[2:02:36] came
[2:02:38] and this is what happened. And I told
[2:02:39] him the whole story.
[2:02:42] And I said he came up there and and and
[2:02:45] then I said then we wanted to get his
[2:02:47] message or the message that God had
[2:02:50] sent. We wanted to get it into the local
[2:02:52] area.
[2:02:54] You came and actually visited us.
[2:02:57] You said you'd like to handle that
[2:02:59] broadcast.
[2:03:00] I said, "I know that your father years
[2:03:03] later now, a few years. You listen to he
[2:03:08] listened to our broadcast before it even
[2:03:11] went out to the people.
[2:03:14] Some of our people would come in here
[2:03:15] and hear hear Brother Bam's voice when
[2:03:18] the door was closed. and he's listening
[2:03:21] to it. Yes. He said, "That's right." I
[2:03:23] said, "We
[2:03:26] we we didn't know. Perhaps you don't
[2:03:28] know like we do now." I said, "That that
[2:03:31] was Elijah. That was a spirit of Elijah.
[2:03:35] God had sent it down as a messenger with
[2:03:38] a message in this time." I said, "You
[2:03:40] didn't know it, but and we didn't know
[2:03:41] it." I said, "And I just wanted to give
[2:03:43] him a rest."
[2:03:46] I said, ' And from that time, and then
[2:03:48] you took the broadcast
[2:03:50] when others wouldn't have it, you took
[2:03:52] it.
[2:03:54] And I said, I believe at that time your
[2:03:56] business just went like this.
[2:03:59] He said, that's exactly right. And
[2:04:02] furthermore, he said, we're going to
[2:04:04] keep your broadcast.
[2:04:06] And they kept it right to the very end.
[2:04:09] Now, I'm giving you some testimony.
[2:04:11] These aren't just hearsay stories,
[2:04:13] friends. This this is what happened. And
[2:04:16] if I'm not here in a year or two,
[2:04:20] whatever God gives me time, if I'm here,
[2:04:24] I will be saying the same thing. But I
[2:04:26] just decided there were things you
[2:04:28] needed to hear.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; You need to believe.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; You need to take a hold of it. I hear
[2:04:36] these other brothers preaching,
[2:04:38] preaching their hearts out, telling the
[2:04:40] people who they are.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Who they are in Christ.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; It's not up to us just to sit back and
[2:04:47] say, "Well, that's nice." No. Give
[2:04:50] yourself to it.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Yield to it.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Even if you get up out of this service
[2:04:56] today, excuse me, and say, "One thing I
[2:05:00] will do.
[2:05:02] I'll commit myself to be a message to be
[2:05:06] a witness to this glorious message.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Whether it's here, whether it's just to
[2:05:13] our friends, whether it's just to the
[2:05:15] girls in the school or the fellas in the
[2:05:18] school, I'll give myself to it.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; I'll speak of it wherever I have an
[2:05:25] opportunity. I'll do what I can. I'll do
[2:05:29] what I can at the house of God. I'll do
[2:05:31] what I can for the gospel of Jesus
[2:05:33] Christ because this message is worth
[2:05:37] everything that I have.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:05:55] I hadn't intended on spending
[2:05:59] the whole time on this gifted children,
[2:06:02] but I think it's very very important.
[2:06:11] I want to close with this
[2:06:15] one quote.
[2:06:37] Brother Brandham says this
[2:06:42] and I want to take it I want you to take
[2:06:44] it to your heart
[2:06:46] and this is not personal but he says I'm
[2:06:49] old now.
[2:06:52] I'm not like I'm not young like you all.
[2:06:56] And he says and he was talking about he
[2:06:58] had to take notes now
[2:07:01] where he in previous life he didn't have
[2:07:04] to take notes
[2:07:06] and he said uh but he said
[2:07:11] I did that I do that I've been through
[2:07:15] many hard battles he said
[2:07:18] and and he said and I've done that to
[2:07:22] bring you where you are today.
[2:07:27] And he says, "And that's the way it is.
[2:07:31] We make we make a way for one another."
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And then there were some
[2:07:41] that went ahead of me and made the way
[2:07:44] for me."
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; He says, "And that's the way it is.
[2:07:48] That's God's plan. We make a way for one
[2:07:51] another."
[2:07:53] I want to say to this congregation,
[2:07:56] to these people, and to all that are
[2:07:58] here, we have a divine commission.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; I don't say that because I'm up here
[2:08:05] preaching. I say that because I've spent
[2:08:08] my life at it.
[2:08:11] These men have spent their life at it.
[2:08:14] The prophet of God spent his life at it,
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; and it's worthy of our effort.
[2:08:23] and you in your home,
[2:08:26] just find a way that you maybe can get
[2:08:29] it across
[2:08:32] if it's as simple as leaving a message
[2:08:34] book someplace,
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; leave it lay there.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; How do you know somebody might not pick
[2:08:41] it up
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; and read something that will speak to
[2:08:45] their soul? And this is almighty God
[2:08:49] sending his spirit and directing people
[2:08:51] and creating a hunger in one. And then
[2:08:54] he find a a message book laying there.
[2:08:56] Lay find the word of God laying there.
[2:09:00] Read of some man of God and affected his
[2:09:04] life. And you don't have to read about
[2:09:06] them. They're here. They're sitting with
[2:09:09] you in this congregation.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; We are we are making a way for one
[2:09:13] another. And God bless you.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; I'll say to brother Murphy, he's
[2:09:20] influenced my life.
[2:09:30] You might never have an opportunity,
[2:09:35] but this is what I spend my time doing.
[2:09:45] You're influencing somebody and
[2:09:47] somebody's influencing you.
[2:09:50] And this is what brother Brandham said
[2:09:51] about influence.
[2:10:12] He said uh
[2:10:15] and God told Balum
[2:10:19] and he was a prophet first he told him
[2:10:22] don't go down
[2:10:24] but the influence of those other men
[2:10:29] caused him to go to do it contrary to
[2:10:34] the way of God.
[2:10:38] I'm just leaving that with you.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; It's all right to hear what other people
[2:10:44] have to say,
[2:10:46] but you don't let what the others have
[2:10:48] said to con to influence you to go
[2:10:52] another direction.
[2:10:55] That's good for everybody, young, old,
[2:10:57] or whoever,
[2:11:02] contrary to what God said. And then he
[2:11:05] said this little five senses that we all
[2:11:09] have you have. He said that's just a
[2:11:12] little world of our own
[2:11:15] but God he said
[2:11:18] that we was only given so we could
[2:11:21] contact our earthly home.
[2:11:25] But there are senses beyond that
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; another dimension.
[2:11:32] And God is always present.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Now just listen real close.
[2:11:41] This God we're talking about, the God
[2:11:43] that spoke to Lazarus,
[2:11:45] he's always present. Is Brother Brandham
[2:11:49] telling a lie? No, I don't think so.
[2:11:53] In this building tonight, he said, and
[2:11:56] I'll say in this building now today
[2:12:00] stands Jesus Christ.
[2:12:03] In this building
[2:12:05] is hosts of angels,
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; thousands of them
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; gathered around. You don't see them,
[2:12:15] but you can feel the influence of them
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; telling you that they are here. Amen.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; You may not feel it at this moment, but
[2:12:27] perhaps during the service or maybe
[2:12:30] while we were worshiping, you feel some
[2:12:34] uh super sense. Something
[2:12:38] comes and begins to well up within you.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; You might not know what it is, but I'm
[2:12:44] here to tell you it's the influence of
[2:12:46] angels
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; from another realm, from another world,
[2:12:50] from another dimension. trying to tell
[2:12:53] you
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; and make you conscious. We are here.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; God is here.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; The one we worship is here.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is here.
[2:13:18] He said, "And when this influence of the
[2:13:20] Holy Ghost,
[2:13:24] you may not feel it, you may not sense
[2:13:26] it, you may not know." Now, I've been
[2:13:29] quite a long time in this service, but
[2:13:30] when this influence of the Holy Ghost, I
[2:13:33] want to tell you what he does.
[2:13:36] The influence of the Holy Ghost struck
[2:13:39] them. It filled them and they seen the
[2:13:43] word that Jesus promised and fulfilled.
[2:13:50] I'm I'm standing here today as a
[2:13:52] witness.
[2:13:54] When I was a child, when I was a young
[2:13:56] fellow,
[2:13:57] the age of you guys,
[2:14:02] I wanted to be a a lawyer.
[2:14:08] My dad thought I should be maybe a
[2:14:10] doctor or something or a lawyer.
[2:14:15] I'm not I'm not proud of it. I had to
[2:14:18] drop out when I was in grade 10.
[2:14:23] In grade nine,
[2:14:26] my father decided to move from northern
[2:14:29] Canada down here.
[2:14:33] I was his son. I was just doing what
[2:14:36] sons do. My sister had already gotten
[2:14:38] married.
[2:14:42] I was 14.
[2:14:47] I don't know what you're doing when
[2:14:48] you're 14. I was just 14.
[2:14:53] Just following along
[2:14:55] with the events of life.
[2:14:58] It wasn't all all good. I was raised up
[2:15:01] in a very very cold area.
[2:15:06] I'm witnessing to you now. I'm telling
[2:15:08] you a witness.
[2:15:13] And my father stopped in a certain town
[2:15:15] over here about 250 300 miles away
[2:15:19] called Vernon, BC.
[2:15:23] And people were gathering from all over
[2:15:26] and gathering to the arena.
[2:15:29] And so we went to the doors to get a
[2:15:31] seat there. and it was packed with
[2:15:34] people and that's when I was 14. I that
[2:15:38] was the first time I saw brother
[2:15:40] Brandham come on the platform and a man
[2:15:42] from Vancouver was his manager Ern
[2:15:46] Baxter and Ern Baxter came up and I'll
[2:15:49] never forget it. He said now when
[2:15:52] brother Brandham comes out he will not
[2:15:53] pray for anybody until the angel of the
[2:15:56] Lord is here at the platform. I thought,
[2:15:59] "Wow,
[2:16:01] I've heard about angels.
[2:16:04] I've heard about him in church. Am I I'm
[2:16:07] going to see a man that's talked to an
[2:16:10] angel?"
[2:16:12] I thought I was way up in the balconies.
[2:16:14] I'm saying something I haven't said
[2:16:16] before. I was up there with Billy Paul.
[2:16:19] I was up there with some other kids that
[2:16:21] were about 14, 15. And we were just
[2:16:24] rambling, just teenagers.
[2:16:32] I wasn't very good in school,
[2:16:35] but I consider myself, and I'm saying
[2:16:37] this for the first time, I'm considering
[2:16:39] myself a gifted child
[2:16:45] because something
[2:16:49] gave a desire in me
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; to leave the gang
[2:16:54] and come down and sit.
[2:16:57] right about where Amy is
[2:17:01] on the on the edge of the aisle.
[2:17:04] I don't know how I got that chair.
[2:17:08] People were offering money, I suppose,
[2:17:10] for the chairs. They couldn't get a
[2:17:13] chair, but I got a chair.
[2:17:16] And I sat there and I thought, I'm going
[2:17:18] to see a man.
[2:17:20] Let's talk to an angel.
[2:17:23] And out came brother Brandham. And
[2:17:26] that's the night I saw a blind girl
[2:17:28] healed, which I never forget.
[2:17:32] And then years later, you know, we're
[2:17:34] just doing what comes naturally. And I
[2:17:37] end up being a preacher,
[2:17:40] end up preaching
[2:17:42] perhaps like Michael
[2:17:44] Mike Andes.
[2:17:47] Just started preaching.
[2:17:50] I just thought, you know, the word of
[2:17:53] God would speak to me. And I still
[2:17:56] remember some of those early messages
[2:17:58] that I spoke.
[2:18:02] I spoke on
[2:18:04] if he'd known if he'd only known and
[2:18:07] what watch the thief would come, he
[2:18:09] would have watched and not have his
[2:18:12] house broken up.
[2:18:14] I spoke that.
[2:18:18] But during in the midst of all of that
[2:18:22] and now I'm going to come home where you
[2:18:23] are.
[2:18:26] There's people that said, "Well, the
[2:18:29] message says this here and it says
[2:18:31] something else over there, and we don't
[2:18:33] know exactly what it says."
[2:18:35] That's not new. That's why I said that's
[2:18:38] that's that's just old stuff. I can tell
[2:18:41] you where the Bible says this over here
[2:18:43] and says that over there.
[2:18:47] I say Jesus said go and teach all
[2:18:50] nations
[2:18:52] and baptize them in the name of the
[2:18:54] father and the son and the holy ghost.
[2:18:58] And then Peter went and baptized them in
[2:19:00] the name of the Lord Jesus.
[2:19:02] So it was a big question. Hey, these
[2:19:05] weren't bunch of dummies. They were
[2:19:07] honest people and I had preachers and
[2:19:10] and they would argue and back and forth
[2:19:12] and I just didn't like to argue.
[2:19:17] They said, "How are you going to be
[2:19:19] baptized?"
[2:19:21] So years later, I want to know
[2:19:24] this man who came out on the platform in
[2:19:28] Vernon when I was 14.
[2:19:31] Now I'm 27.
[2:19:34] So 10, 12, 13 years have gone by. Is he
[2:19:38] still the same?
[2:19:40] How is he baptized?
[2:19:43] And the big question was, is the angel
[2:19:46] still here with him? That one who said
[2:19:51] the angel of the Lord, I believed in
[2:19:53] that angel. I believed in that pillar of
[2:19:56] fire. I believed in that with all my
[2:19:58] heart. Is that all right if I give you
[2:20:00] this testimony?
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; I'm just finished with it just now. So I
[2:20:05] thought now, now we come right up to our
[2:20:09] time.
[2:20:11] A few years ago, I wondered,
[2:20:15] is that angel still with him?
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; So, I'll take him up for a rest, but I
[2:20:20] wondered, is the angel still with him?
[2:20:25] If the angel isn't there, I've got a big
[2:20:28] problem.
[2:20:30] And now I've talked to the native Indian
[2:20:32] people
[2:20:34] about him. I've talked to all about
[2:20:35] these things that have happened in the
[2:20:38] supernatural and the evidence of the
[2:20:41] resurrection. Is he still there?
[2:20:44] If it's not there, I'm in a real fix.
[2:20:49] So, I went up
[2:20:51] and that's why, friends, it means so
[2:20:53] much to me.
[2:20:58] And we're out in the wilderness, way
[2:21:00] out, the total wilderness.
[2:21:03] Now I'm I'm I'm just going to be a
[2:21:05] couple minutes yet.
[2:21:08] And I
[2:21:10] I was just turning inside. That mass of
[2:21:14] darkness
[2:21:16] was inside cuz I didn't have an answer
[2:21:19] to some things. I preached. Yeah. I
[2:21:23] played the guitar. We sang. We had
[2:21:26] services. People came. They were happy.
[2:21:30] They shook our hand. I know what church
[2:21:33] is.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; I know what church is.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; I know that people can enjoy it and have
[2:21:42] a wonderful time. Listen to me, my dear
[2:21:45] friends.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; My precious young fellas. I'm speaking
[2:21:49] to you right out of my soul. We're not
[2:21:51] here to create a church for you.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to create a church
[2:21:57] atmosphere. We're here to tell you this
[2:22:00] is a living message. And if it's not, I
[2:22:03] want to leave the scene and be gone out
[2:22:05] of here. But this is a living message.
[2:22:08] And so here I am now. And I'm wondering,
[2:22:13] is the angel still there?
[2:22:17] So I'm at 27
[2:22:20] and I'm up in the mountains.
[2:22:24] And he says
[2:22:26] these words that I never forgot.
[2:22:30] I I never forgot when he would say just
[2:22:33] little things. Maybe you remember this.
[2:22:35] He put up his hand and I it just was
[2:22:39] such a remarkable thing to me. Said he's
[2:22:41] here
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; and now I take every spirit here under
[2:22:47] my control. That to me seemed like such
[2:22:50] an outstanding thing. He's here.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; And that those words just were anchored,
[2:22:56] brother Roy, in my heart.
[2:22:58] And so here we are. We're just doing
[2:23:01] what we always do. We're just hunting. I
[2:23:03] got my gun over the shoulder. We're just
[2:23:05] doing what we always do. We live up in
[2:23:08] the north and we This is what we do. We
[2:23:11] just live there. I tie my moccasins a
[2:23:13] certain way and just, you know, just
[2:23:16] wear regular clothes. I'm like the woman
[2:23:20] going to the well,
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; but I've got huge questions inside
[2:23:26] and they're not answerable.
[2:23:29] No man, I have wonderful ministers and I
[2:23:33] respect them, but no one can convince me
[2:23:36] it should be this way or it should be
[2:23:38] that way or the Godhead or the baptism.
[2:23:41] And the serpent sat didn't want to talk
[2:23:43] about it.
[2:23:47] Now, I'm telling you my testimony
[2:23:49] because I have your ear and I have this
[2:23:51] privilege and I'm going to close right
[2:23:54] away.
[2:24:00] And he said,
[2:24:02] "So, we're having this little walk. I'm
[2:24:05] trying to give him a little rest, but
[2:24:08] the one that is speaking through him
[2:24:11] wants to answer my questions."
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; You know how long I've wrestled with
[2:24:14] these questions?
[2:24:17] probably 10 years.
[2:24:20] 10 years God let me wrestle with them.
[2:24:23] 10 years God let me be out in a kind of
[2:24:27] a wilderness. 10 years. You might say,
[2:24:30] "Well, I got questions." Forget it.
[2:24:34] The God you claim and the God you're
[2:24:36] worshiping, he knows about that.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; And he'll answer that in his time. He
[2:24:42] doesn't go on our time.
[2:24:44] He goes on his own time.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; He'll answer your question.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; You ask it and hold it honestly before
[2:24:51] God. He'll answer it.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; He will answer it.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; You have questions. Your question might
[2:24:58] be, "Is this true?" He'll tell you it's
[2:25:01] true or not.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; So, we're sitting on a log. That's why
[2:25:08] it means so much to me. And I mention it
[2:25:10] every once in a while. And he said,
[2:25:15] he said, "I believe I was riding on my I
[2:25:17] was riding on my horse on this mountain
[2:25:20] over here."
[2:25:22] And he says, "He came to me there."
[2:25:26] Soon as he said he came to me there, I
[2:25:28] just turned my head, looked at him right
[2:25:30] in his eyes. Brother Nathan, his eyes
[2:25:33] were deep set.
[2:25:36] His countenance had changed a bit.
[2:25:40] I just looked at him and he looked at
[2:25:41] me.
[2:25:44] Said, "I believe you have three
[2:25:45] questions
[2:25:47] you want to ask me." If he said four, I
[2:25:50] wouldn't be here.
[2:25:53] I believe you have three questions you
[2:25:55] ought to ask me. And they were stacked
[2:25:57] in my heart in a certain order.
[2:26:01] The first one was the godhead
[2:26:04] and the second one was a
[2:26:06] baptism
[2:26:08] and the third one was the serpent seed.
[2:26:11] And he he named those three like that.
[2:26:15] What was God doing? He was sending his
[2:26:18] word to a darkened, confused mass.
[2:26:23] And when I say tonight or just today, it
[2:26:26] was a chaotic mass when he spoke to the
[2:26:29] world. And on the weekend, I said during
[2:26:33] the week I was studying, I said, "We are
[2:26:35] that mass. I live amongst that. That's
[2:26:38] here in the world. It's all over the
[2:26:41] place.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; We live in it." I said, "God, help the
[2:26:46] people this morning.
[2:26:48] help them
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; that they might know that their God is
[2:26:52] not the author of the mass. He speaks to
[2:26:56] it.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; And don't worry about it, friends.
[2:27:00] Whatever you do, don't worry about it.
[2:27:03] He knows exactly
[2:27:05] how to bring and he's going to bring a
[2:27:08] beauty.
[2:27:09] Fact is, I don't have the time. I'd love
[2:27:11] to be able to take the time, but it's a
[2:27:14] he's speaking to it with an intent. I'm
[2:27:18] going to form this and not just answer
[2:27:21] the questions. I'm going to form this
[2:27:23] into the beauty of a bride that is my
[2:27:26] bride.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; That's what's happening.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you here, he knows how to
[2:27:36] answer questions.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:41] We'll pray.
[2:27:43] Heavenly Father,
[2:27:46] you're so kind.
[2:27:49] You're so kind.
[2:27:51] You help us in these moments, Lord, as I
[2:27:55] seek, oh God, just to give myself and
[2:28:00] give parts of my life.
[2:28:02] As you sent your messenger,
[2:28:06] you did not prevent him from his
[2:28:09] sorrows. You did not prevent him to live
[2:28:14] without any problem, without any
[2:28:17] trouble. Oh God, I think of how you
[2:28:21] allowed him even to see his little
[2:28:24] daughter die and not not deliver her
[2:28:30] from her sickness when you would knew
[2:28:32] that you would send that man to pray for
[2:28:35] a multitudes of people and he would do
[2:28:38] so. I pray father you'll take these
[2:28:41] words feeble as they may be you'll take
[2:28:44] these words and cause have caused me as
[2:28:48] I spoke to you today and said you Holy
[2:28:52] Spirit be the speaker be the one that
[2:28:56] says something to the souls of the
[2:28:59] people in Jesus name. Amen. Would you
[2:29:04] like to stand?
[2:29:08] I'd like to sing. Good. Oh, how I love
[2:29:11] him. How I adore him.
[2:29:16] Perhaps the course part.
[2:29:27] How I adore
[2:29:30] him.
[2:29:33] My breath, my sun shines,
[2:29:38] my all
[2:29:42] [Music]
[2:29:44] the great creator,
[2:29:51] my savior
[2:29:55] and all God
[2:30:00] is dwelling.
[2:30:05] I'd like to have you sing it with me
[2:30:07] once more. Please sing it. And I'd like
[2:30:09] to sing it as I would like to sing it.
[2:30:12] Just a little bit more oomph. If you
[2:30:15] know what that means. Oh, how I love
[2:30:20] him.
[2:30:22] I
[2:30:23] [Music]
[2:30:27] my
[2:30:29] sunshine
[2:30:32] my
[2:30:34] heart
[2:30:37] the great
[2:30:39] [Music]
[2:30:42] became my savior
[2:30:46] and all
[2:30:48] [Music]
[2:30:51] Dwell.
[2:30:56] Oh,
[2:31:00] worship him. I adore him.
[2:31:06] I
[2:31:08] sunshine
[2:31:12] all
[2:31:14] [Music]
[2:31:16] the great
[2:31:18] [Music]
[2:31:21] be my savior
[2:31:26] and all the fullness
[2:31:30] dwelling
[2:31:32] in him.
[2:31:34] Would you sing with me? Oh, how I love
[2:31:36] him.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; How I adore him.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; How I adore him.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; He's my breath.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; My sunshine.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; And all that I could be. Hallelujah.
[2:31:49] Hallelujah.
[2:31:50] Oh, how we thank you. We love you, Lord
[2:31:54] Jesus. We love you. We've come to the
[2:31:57] close of this service. I pray that
[2:31:59] you'll bless this people, oh God. I pray
[2:32:02] that you'll bless Brother Murphy Wong as
[2:32:04] he comes to the pulpit. May the living
[2:32:07] word of God come off of those pages,
[2:32:10] printed in black and white, but may they
[2:32:13] come off of the pages and be a living
[2:32:15] testimony to him and what you've done
[2:32:18] for the people, oh God, and his country.
[2:32:20] I pray now you'll bless the word to us
[2:32:23] and the words that have been spoken now
[2:32:25] this morning. Father, I've just sought
[2:32:27] to give it by way of part testimony and
[2:32:31] part preaching. I pray that you'll bless
[2:32:34] the people, Father, in the name of the
[2:32:36] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. Amen.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; Just turn to somebody and greet them and
[2:32:46] thank them for being here and being with
[2:32:48] you and being a part of you. God bless
[2:32:51] you.
[2:33:03] Hallelujah.
[2:33:05] [Music]
[2:33:35] Heat. Heat.
[2:33:37] [Music]
[2:33:53] Lord.
[2:34:04] [Music]
