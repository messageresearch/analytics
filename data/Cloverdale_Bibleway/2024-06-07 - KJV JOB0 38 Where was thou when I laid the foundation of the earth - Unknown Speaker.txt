========================================
who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge gir up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sank together and all the the sons of God shouted for Joy or who shut up the sea with doors when it Break Forth as if it had issued out of the womb when I made the cloud the Garment thereof and thick Darkness a swaddling band for it and break up for it my decreed place and set bars and doors and said hither to shalt Thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed hast thou commanded the morning since thy days and caus the day spring to know his place that it might take hold of the ends of the Earth that the wicked might be shaken out of it
