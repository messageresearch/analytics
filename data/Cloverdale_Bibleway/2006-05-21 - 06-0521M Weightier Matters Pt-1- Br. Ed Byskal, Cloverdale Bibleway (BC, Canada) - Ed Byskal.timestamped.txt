[15:19] And Father, as individuals, may there be
[15:21] a cry within our hearts, pass me not, oh
[15:24] gentle Savior.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Hear my humble cry this morning. Lord,
[15:28] there's many churches that are
[15:30] gathering, Lord, but you're not passing
[15:32] by their way, but we believe that you're
[15:34] amongst the church of the living God. So
[15:38] Lord, as you pass by, may we reach out
[15:40] in faith. Say, Lord, I claim my need. I
[15:44] receive my healing. Lord, there's a
[15:46] desire within for more of God. I claim
[15:49] that in the name of Jesus Christ. So
[15:52] meet every need in divine presence.
[15:54] Brother Milo has asked for a loved one.
[15:56] We are asking for our loved ones this
[15:59] morning. Lord, speak to them. Deal with
[16:02] their lives. Redeem the lost. save those
[16:06] that have Lord been written in that
[16:08] lamb's book of life this morning. And
[16:11] so, Father, we've come to hear from the
[16:14] throne of grace.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Would you anoint brother Biscol?
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Would you anoint not only speaker, but
[16:21] Lord, anoint our ears to hear?
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, there's a thirsting, there's a
[16:26] longing, then there must be a deep to
[16:28] respond. So, Lord, speak to us deeply
[16:32] from your word. Move us, Lord, into
[16:35] depths we have not known, Lord, and
[16:38] we'll be sure to give you all the glory,
[16:41] the honor, and praise. Speak to every
[16:43] one of us. Those that have joined with
[16:46] us, Lord, on the internet, move upon
[16:48] their hearts and lives. Deal with us
[16:50] all, Lord. We need the dealing of God
[16:53] within our lives. Speak, we pray once
[16:56] again. And father for the remainder of
[16:58] the song service Lord God may it be
[17:01] sweet praise and may it be sweet odors
[17:04] before the throne of grace. We pray in

[19:39] of a mighty rock within a weery land.
[19:47] A home within the wildness,
[19:53] a rest upon the way.

[20:52] the ladder
[20:54] up to heaven.

[21:11] the very dying form of one who suffered
[21:19] there for me. me
[21:22] and from my stricken heart with tears to
[21:29] wonders I confess
[21:33] the wonders
[21:36] of redeeming
[21:38] love

[21:53] for my abiding
[21:56] place.

[22:04] than the sunshine of his face.
[22:09] Content to let this world go by, to know
[22:16] no gain or loss.
[22:20] My sinful self, my only shame,

[31:02] [Music]

[32:43] We're here to worship him.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; We're here to give him
[32:49] what is what is due to him. Amen.
[32:55] I believe you feel that way. It's how I
[32:57] feel.
[33:00] Amen.
[33:03] Before
[33:05] we turn to the word, we have uh an
[33:07] announcement
[33:09] and also
[33:11] uh going to have a brief testimony. Got
[33:14] a bit of a surprise for you.
[33:17] But we were surprised to receive the
[33:20] call on Thursday evening that our
[33:23] brother Jake Hoffer
[33:25] had suddenly passed into the presence of
[33:28] the Lord.
[33:29] And we were not only surprised but we
[33:33] were praying that he would be returned
[33:36] to us. And there was a
[33:40] uh when I first got the first call uh
[33:44] there was still a pulse in our brother's
[33:46] body and we thought that perhaps the
[33:49] Lord would bring him back to us. That
[33:52] was our prayer. That's always our
[33:55] desire. But God is sovereign. He does he
[34:00] does things according to his own will
[34:02] and we just are pleased with that. But
[34:06] he passed into the presence of the Lord
[34:07] on Thursday evening
[34:10] and uh his going was very sudden.
[34:14] He was actually in his truck at the
[34:16] wheel of his truck and his employer who
[34:19] he works for on the farm, he's been
[34:22] there about 12 years.
[34:25] He had uh just offloaded some things
[34:27] from the tractor to the truck and then
[34:30] continued on. Got to the end of the
[34:31] field and coming back he noticed the
[34:34] truck hadn't moved and brother Jake was
[34:37] just slumped over the wheel. So
[34:41] uh short time later was determined that
[34:44] he could not be resuscitated.
[34:48] We are missing him. And sister Marian,
[34:51] his dear wife, is here in the service
[34:54] this morning. And I say, God bless her.
[34:57] God bless the family. God bless them
[35:00] with peace. God bless them with comfort.
[35:05] And
[35:06] I can say that the time we spent with
[35:08] them that evening, it was evident. And
[35:13] my wife could only say when we were in
[35:15] the car. Uh we don't sorrow as others.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Uh it's not something you have to try to
[35:23] put on. It's just something you possess.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; We do not sorrow as others. It's not
[35:29] something somebody tells you. It's not
[35:31] something that you're instructed to do.
[35:34] It's something that's from within.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; And I have experienced it. And I have
[35:40] seen the members of this congregation
[35:44] and other believers
[35:46] elsewhere. I've seen that strange and
[35:50] marvelous
[35:51] just supreme
[35:54] grace that comes to the believer even so
[35:58] that the uh unbelieving marvel
[36:03] and and many times do not believe it. Do
[36:07] not believe it. They believe that
[36:08] they're in some form of denial that will
[36:11] finally uh uh collapse and then they
[36:15] will come into such a shock. But it
[36:17] never happens
[36:19] and it never happened in my life when I
[36:21] have lost uh someone very very dear as
[36:25] my father suddenly was taken from me and
[36:28] uh I prayed for it was impossible. I
[36:31] wouldn't accept it of course but God
[36:33] poured in a grace that was beyond my own
[36:36] imagination. And I'm waiting for the
[36:38] sorrow to come, waiting for that
[36:39] separation, waiting for that terrible
[36:42] sting, and somehow it just doesn't
[36:45] arrive. The grace overpowers it.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Do you believe in that kind of grace?
[36:51] &gt;&gt; I do. And I believe in that kind of
[36:54] grace for our sister Marian
[36:56] and her entire family.
[37:00] And God bless them all. The service will
[37:03] be at 10:00 a.m.
[37:05] on Tuesday,
[37:07] not here in the church. It will be held
[37:11] in Lynen, Washington at the Third
[37:14] Reformed Christian Church at 514
[37:20] Liberty Street in Lyndon. There's a map
[37:23] that's pinned up on the bulletin board,
[37:26] and there are printed copies there for
[37:28] directions for you. It's very simple and
[37:31] very easy to find right in Lynen 514
[37:35] Liberty Street. And there will be a
[37:38] viewing tomorrow, Monday, from 4:00 p.m.
[37:42] to 8:00 p.m. But that will be at Gilly's
[37:46] Funeral Home. And the Gilly's funeral
[37:49] home is at 202
[37:52] Front Street. That's right there on the
[37:54] main street, Front Street in Lynen,
[37:57] Washington. And I
[38:00] I know that Sister Marian and her family
[38:04] will not only be pleased to have you
[38:07] there at the service, but they will be
[38:10] strengthened by your presence and your
[38:12] fellowship because there is strength in
[38:15] the body of Christ.
[38:19] Amen. God bless them.
[38:23] Well, we have brother Deepak Titus with
[38:25] us. And brother Deepac, one of you just
[38:29] stand. Would you please be greeted?
[38:33] We welcome him.
[38:39] Brother Deepac Titus is the son of a
[38:43] pastor Titus in India.
[38:47] And you know, I have a habit and I think
[38:49] it would be a good habit for you to pick
[38:51] up if you don't already haven't already
[38:53] acquired it. They say often that the
[38:56] congregation does what the pastor does.
[38:58] Well, uh I wouldn't want you to do
[39:00] everything I do, but don't don't acquire
[39:03] my failings and faults, but there are
[39:06] some good things I think. And one of
[39:08] them is I always try to find out when I
[39:12] meet somebody, how did you come to the
[39:15] message? How did you hear about this
[39:18] message? And then I love to hear how
[39:22] someone else's candle got lit.
[39:24] It's just so inspiring. Brother Brandham
[39:27] says, "If you can't preach, well, you
[39:30] can testify how your candle got lit."
[39:32] So, I've taken from that and I think
[39:35] that's always been so wonderful. You
[39:37] know, I've been with people that have
[39:39] come like, you know, from America or
[39:41] Europe or something. We go to some third
[39:43] world country and and we always feel we
[39:45] have so much to offer and they're just
[39:47] talking and talking and talking and I I
[39:50] I like I like to just be quiet. I like
[39:52] to hear someone else talk. Then you hear
[39:54] them speak, you find out I shouldn't
[39:57] have said anything in the first place.
[39:59] Their testimony is so rich and so
[40:02] wonderful. And here brother Deepak is
[40:04] sitting there quiet. We just met him at
[40:05] the airport and this is our first time.
[40:08] Brother Milo came with me because I was
[40:10] had so many things to do and to prepare
[40:12] for for the services and the funeral and
[40:16] brother Milo maybe you can come and and
[40:19] be with our brother some. and this is
[40:21] what a program we want to do. So we're
[40:24] sitting there, we're having our tea. Our
[40:26] brothers and saying anything, you know,
[40:28] we're doing most the talking.
[40:31] Same old American habit. You know, we do
[40:34] the talking. Finally, I said, "Brother
[40:36] Deepac, how did you come to the
[40:38] message?" Oh, smile came across his
[40:40] face. You know, it's wonderful.
[40:43] Uh he said, "My grandfather was a
[40:46] pastor."
[40:47] Oh, your grandfather was a pastor. Well,
[40:50] how did was he was he in the message
[40:53] today? Oh, yes. Yes. He said, you know,
[40:56] he was in brother Brandham's meetings in
[40:58] Bombay. Oh, he was wonderful. Yes. He
[41:03] said, you you remember the account of
[41:06] the man whose eyes were he was blind and
[41:09] they were said he was a sun worshipper
[41:11] and his eyes was burned out. Well, yes,
[41:14] of course I remember. He says, "My
[41:15] grandfather was in the meeting." Then I
[41:18] decided I had nothing to say.
[41:21] That's about the time I'm all ears.
[41:24] Marvelous. Yes, he said. And not only
[41:26] that, but there was more to it than
[41:29] that. And I want him to tell you.
[41:32] His grandfather was in the meeting where
[41:35] the famous blind man was healed.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; I thought that was a marvelous
[41:41] connection.
[41:43] And uh I want brother Jeremy Bergen to
[41:45] be sure and get this testimony from our
[41:49] brother our brother Dpac Titus. Brother
[41:52] Deepak is going to be bringing his wife
[41:54] and young family here the Lord willing
[41:57] and he knows a lot of the people here
[41:59] because they've been streaming the
[42:01] meeting for a long time. And I want him
[42:04] to just to take a moment greet you from
[42:07] his father who's now the pastor of the
[42:10] church there in their city. and just
[42:12] tell you about that evening and
[42:17] the rest of the story. Come brother
[42:20] Deepac.
[42:24] God bless you.
[42:28] Amen. Just take a moment.
[42:34] Praise the Lord everybody.
[42:37] It's really a great privilege for me to
[42:39] be here and to stand in the fellowship
[42:42] of the saints. Uh I never imagined few
[42:45] years back that I'll be coming here and
[42:48] I'll ever get to meet brother Biscll and
[42:50] the lovely fellowship here. But um God
[42:53] has laid down everything in his time and
[42:56] uh it's really wonderful. It's a
[42:58] wonderful time for me to uh you know see
[43:01] you all. It's really a lovely bride.
[43:06] Uh I forgot brother yesterday to
[43:10] convey the greetings from my father. Uh
[43:13] he has conveyed his Christian love and
[43:15] greetings to you and your family and to
[43:18] all the saints in the fellowship here.
[43:22] uh we stream the uh the uh uh we we see
[43:26] the streaming video streaming on the
[43:28] internet and uh we we feel that we are
[43:32] part of this fellowship because
[43:34] ultimately we are part of that body.
[43:37] So and we really love to uh you know see
[43:40] the sermons hear them and they really do
[43:43] a lot of edification.
[43:47] Uh I have written down a few things. So
[43:50] please don't mind if I read it from the
[43:51] paper so that I don't miss out
[43:53] something. Okay. Thank you.
[43:57] Uh okay before that I'll give my
[43:58] greetings to my family who is streaming
[44:00] in Winnipeg and my uh parents who are in
[44:03] India. They also would be streaming
[44:05] right now. So I convey my greetings to
[44:07] them as well.
[44:10] Uh
[44:14] I was born in a end time message family.
[44:17] And uh as I grew up, I came to uh know
[44:21] uh the message. I came to know about the
[44:23] messenger.
[44:24] And uh I came to know the truth that's
[44:27] in the Bible because the Bible if I
[44:30] would read it alone, I wouldn't get to
[44:32] know much about it. But then when I saw
[44:35] the message, when I read the message,
[44:36] then it started opening to me. And
[44:39] that's when I learned that what my dad
[44:41] says is exactly the truth. because you
[44:44] need a person to open that book and that
[44:48] is the messenger. So I was born in a end
[44:51] time message family and as I grew up I
[44:54] started learning uh about the message
[44:56] from my father. We had a very small
[44:59] group in Nagpur. uh we had uh two three
[45:02] people coming in and we had a family
[45:04] worship sort of a thing and uh it
[45:08] started growing slowly but even when we
[45:10] were just uh seven eight people uh there
[45:13] one lady who was from denominations she
[45:15] used to pass by from the front of our
[45:17] house and she once gave the testimony
[45:19] that I guess there's a lot of people in
[45:21] your fellowship because when I go from
[45:23] here I hear many voices my dad said
[45:25] there are few people but loud voices is
[45:34] uh I I'll tell you something about my
[45:35] family before and then I'll go to the
[45:37] other part of the testimony. I have my
[45:40] wife Vandana she is a medical doctor and
[45:43] my two children uh their Shakina one
[45:46] daughter she's 5 and a half years old
[45:49] and my son he is Ashish he is three and
[45:52] a half years old.
[45:54] Uh yeah it's a small family.
[45:58] And my parents they uh they are
[46:01] government officers in India. And uh my
[46:05] dad he's working at the same time he's
[46:07] uh taking care of the fellowship. He's
[46:09] the pastor there. My mama also works. Uh
[46:13] my dad and mom they've given me a lot of
[46:16] love and through that love they've
[46:18] guided me into truth.
[46:20] Uh they were never uh they were never
[46:23] invective. They were always uh they
[46:25] always dealt with us with great love and
[46:29] that is a thing uh which is more than a
[46:31] tool to handle a child. I guess
[46:36] my mom, she uh really took great care of
[46:39] us and not only us but also of the
[46:43] ministers used to off and on come to our
[46:46] place and we used to have conventions
[46:48] going on and she would love to have them
[46:50] in the house and you know make the stay
[46:52] as comfortable as she could.
[46:55] Uh
[46:59] I have two sisters. Uh my elder sister
[47:01] her name is Joti. She's also a medical
[47:03] doctor and uh the second sister is
[47:06] Kiran. She's an engineer and they both
[47:10] are very strong end time message
[47:12] believers.
[47:16] Uh my second sister, she is uh uh she's
[47:20] not in Nagpur, she is in Pune, that's uh
[47:23] about 900 kilometers from our place.
[47:27] Uh okay. Now to come to the main part of
[47:29] the testimony. uh my grandparents they
[47:32] were Pentecostals
[47:34] and uh when brother Brham he came in
[47:37] 1952 to Bombay
[47:40] my grandfather's family they took my uh
[47:43] they took uh my grandfather's sister she
[47:46] was very critically ill and the doctors
[47:49] said that she won't be able to live more
[47:52] and nothing can be done about her and
[47:55] she would die.
[47:57] So they took her to the prayer meeting
[48:00] with the hope that God will heal her.
[48:03] When they went that same day when uh my
[48:07] my grandfather's sister got the prayer
[48:09] card, the prayer card number was one.
[48:12] Her prayer card number was one and the
[48:15] uh same day the man the boy who was a
[48:19] sun worshipper and his eyes had got
[48:21] burnt out. So he was healed that same
[48:25] day on the day when my grandfather's
[48:27] sister was taken there.
[48:33] As brother Brham saw her,
[48:36] he
[48:39] called out her name. He said Esther
[48:41] Titus.
[48:45] Uh after marriage she's known as Esther
[48:47] Massi.
[48:49] And she said you have come from Nagpur
[48:52] and uh you are suffering from such and
[48:54] such a thing and uh you are a girl who
[48:59] has no gu in your heart
[49:04] and he proclaimed her healing
[49:07] and she's healthy and alive even today.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:14] [Music]
[49:16] Amen.
[49:19] So God is an awesome God.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; That was the time of the visitation of
[49:27] God's prophet in our family.
[49:31] He really visited our family personally.
[49:34] He took my family name over his lips and
[49:37] that's wonderful to me.
[49:45] Uh
[49:47] after that the truth gripped my
[49:50] grandparents,
[49:51] my greatgrandparents that is my daddy's
[49:54] daddy's dad.
[49:57] So it gripped my great greatgrandfather,
[50:00] my grandfather, my grand my father, then
[50:04] my grandmother
[50:07] and saw about nine or 10 people together
[50:12] of three different generations took
[50:14] baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[50:17] &gt;&gt; and they accepted the message.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; And even today my dad has the same zeal
[50:25] &gt;&gt; as he had must have had at that time. I
[50:28] was not there that time
[50:31] but he has the same forward.
[50:34] So the Lord has dealt mightily in our
[50:36] family and three generations together
[50:39] got visited at the same time by our
[50:41] prophet and they accepted the message
[50:45] and it made it a part of the life.
[50:54] My grandfather, he was very very close
[50:57] with the Lord. And if you see his
[51:00] message books, even today, my dad uses
[51:03] his message books and uh the message
[51:07] books of brother Brandham, the ones he
[51:09] used to read. So he has made lots of
[51:13] comments and red pen and green pen and
[51:16] blue pen and everything and some you
[51:18] know connections with some other message
[51:20] and uh like that. And so his uh books,
[51:23] my grandfather's books which are still
[51:25] lying with my father, they have got two
[51:27] matters. One is the printed matter and
[51:28] the other one is the written matter.
[51:31] Lots of interconnections and everything.
[51:33] And my dad loves to read from it and
[51:35] preach from it. So that's the way and
[51:38] it's really wonderful to have it
[51:42] &gt;&gt; before uh he uh slept in the lord my
[51:45] grandfather he came to know through the
[51:47] holy spirit that he is going to leave in
[51:50] a few days
[51:53] he even knew that he's going to leave in
[51:55] next 5 days and there was a big
[51:57] convention that he he had arranged in
[51:59] our town and uh uh he already had
[52:04] suffered about seven heart attacks
[52:07] And he was a very well-built hefty
[52:08] personality and everybody was saying
[52:11] that please don't take the strain now
[52:13] there are other believers also we will
[52:15] manage the thing he said no when I my my
[52:18] meeting is scheduled on the uh on the
[52:21] date I have to be there that is my uh
[52:25] place of service and I cannot go behind
[52:28] it whatever it be I will be there and he
[52:30] wasn't well but still he preached with
[52:32] all enthusiasm
[52:35] And in the evening of that meeting at
[52:37] 4:00 he slept in the lord.
[52:41] So till the last time he performed his
[52:44] service
[52:47] after before leaving he ordained my
[52:50] father as the pastor because he knew
[52:52] that he was going to leave. He ordained
[52:54] my father and then my father he became
[52:57] the pastor of the church. He started
[52:58] pastoring and the work started growing
[53:01] slowly. Over the years a lot of people
[53:03] came and uh more than 100 people maybe
[53:06] they came to the fellowship and uh when
[53:09] they saw that oh okay fine the thing is
[53:13] truth okay it's correct but then it
[53:16] requires a lot of strictness there's no
[53:18] flexibility
[53:20] wearing clothes and jewelry and makeup
[53:22] and all every other thing so they just
[53:25] couldn't go ahead together and they took
[53:28] their own way but we have nearly 30
[53:31] people who are really strong in the
[53:34] message.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; So 30 souls is a good number.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; We we we we visited many Islam areas. Uh
[53:51] we spread out the message as to as many
[53:55] people as we could. uh to the poor
[53:58] people to the people who are doing the
[53:59] service and every other people all the
[54:02] Christian homes but since the place is
[54:05] such it will never let anybody receive
[54:08] the message it's a very dry land and as
[54:12] it is physically physically also it's a
[54:14] very dry land it doesn't have any good
[54:15] rivers nothing and crops is also very
[54:18] poor and so is the uh nature of the
[54:21] people so whatever seed you sow there it
[54:24] might never reap It might never grow.
[54:29] But then our work is to testify.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; We held many message conventions and uh
[54:44] we try to uh do the outreach as much as
[54:48] uh we can. Even now we go to every other
[54:52] convention. Even if somebody else is
[54:54] holding it, we try to uh tell the people
[54:56] about the truth and uh some people do
[54:59] get interested but meanwhile somebody
[55:01] else comes and poisons their mind and
[55:04] they get lost.
[55:08] My dad says Nagpur is a perfect fit for
[55:10] the Pergamin church age because Nagpur
[55:14] has got the headquarters of WCC World
[55:16] Council of Churches. It has got the
[55:18] headquarters of RSS and has got a lot of
[55:20] other headquarters. So all the
[55:22] organizations the headquarters is in
[55:24] Bergamman that is in Nagpur.
[55:36] Uh my dad he suffered a heart attack in
[55:38] 1989
[55:41] and doctor said that uh he has got a
[55:44] myioardial infraction and nothing much
[55:46] can be done about it. Maybe he'll
[55:47] require an open heart surgery. So they
[55:50] told that you should take him to the uh
[55:52] Apollo hospital that's in Madras
[55:55] and uh we went there and uh everything
[55:59] but then the Lord healed him completely.
[56:02] He gave him the verse of Isaiah 53:5
[56:05] which says that the inhabitant shall not
[56:07] say that I am sick.
[56:09] So he said when the when the Lord says
[56:11] that the inhabitant shall not say that I
[56:13] am sick, I am not sick. I am not a heart
[56:15] patient. And then he went to the
[56:17] specialist, the cardiologist. He took
[56:19] his ECG and he said, "Oh, he just threw
[56:22] a stethoscope
[56:24] and he said, "Oh, you have a heart of an
[56:26] athlete.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Did you ever suffer a heart attack?" You
[56:30] send. So that's it. The Lord is the
[56:33] healer.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] I was 13 years old when my sisters, my
[56:46] two sisters and I, we took baptism in
[56:49] the new Lord Jesus Christ.
[56:52] We have been uh experiencing the
[56:54] richness of the beautiful message each
[56:57] passing day of our life and uh the
[57:01] marvelous works and the vindications
[57:02] that we see in our church and all over
[57:04] the world that really strengthens us
[57:07] more and more each day.
[57:14] We greatly desire to be in this
[57:16] fellowship because we always have uh
[57:18] accepted this fellowship as our
[57:20] fellowship and uh we have been we though
[57:24] we have not been physically sitting here
[57:26] but we have been in the internet
[57:27] audience and uh our full heart is with
[57:31] this fellowship.
[57:34] uh we have been listening to brother
[57:38] Briscoll's video tapes more signs of the
[57:40] end time we have heard that more than
[57:42] once uh we have seen that and uh even
[57:46] after that we have seen many other video
[57:47] tapes uh when he had conventions in I
[57:50] guess it's in West Virginia brother Roy
[57:52] Shbury's church uh that we have been
[57:56] seeing and uh a lot of other tapes and
[57:58] of course uh we have been listening to
[58:01] uh brother Biscll's daughters uh We have
[58:04] few of their tapes and we have been
[58:07] listening to them since we were quite
[58:08] small. So way back in 1988 we have been
[58:12] listening to their tape since then. And
[58:15] then I love you Lord and there is a
[58:16] fountain and the songs that she was
[58:18] playing here today. Oh my, it reminded
[58:21] me of my little time you know when I
[58:23] used to listen to the same songs that
[58:24] she used to be singing with her sisters.
[58:26] So it's wonderful. It's a great blessing
[58:29] and I believe that the Lord is uniting
[58:31] the bride all over the world through his
[58:33] holy spirit by sending the same message
[58:36] the same dealing
[58:38] and it's too marvelous to know that when
[58:41] my uh dad used to preach a message in
[58:43] Nagpur and that's the other part of the
[58:45] world exactly opposite maybe and uh the
[58:49] same message in the evening when I hear
[58:51] from brother biscuit
[58:53] &gt;&gt; it's too good you know you know that
[58:55] it's the holy spirit who's giving
[58:57] You know that is the Holy Spirit who's
[58:59] dealing with you and that is the food
[59:01] for you food for the hour.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Uh there there's been a lot of other
[59:10] testimonies. I won't take much of your
[59:11] time. But then there there was a
[59:13] crippled boy and his mother was a Hindu
[59:16] and she came when he was about four or
[59:19] five years old and both his feet the
[59:23] souls of the feet they were facing up.
[59:25] So they never touched the floor and he
[59:28] was born that way. And when he came to
[59:30] the fellowship and uh the faith started
[59:33] growing in her and then she said uh I
[59:36] want to take baptism in the name of Les
[59:37] Jesus Christ and she was baptized and
[59:40] you believe me within a few few months
[59:44] time both his feet turned and he started
[59:47] walking well and then he started running
[59:51] and he said she said the doctor said he
[59:53] might not be well because he's been born
[59:55] that way and it's all congenital and
[59:58] nothing can be done about it because his
[59:59] bones are crooked and but the Lord has
[1:00:02] made it straight.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; And she used to always stand up and give
[1:00:06] the testimony
[1:00:08] that though my son is not walking today,
[1:00:11] he's got his feet like that, but I know
[1:00:13] that God will heal him. And that used to
[1:00:15] be her testimony and the Lord Jesus
[1:00:17] really did it.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; And there's several other testimonies.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; So that really strengthens our faith
[1:00:26] because our God is the same God. He's
[1:00:28] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; What he did when brother Brandham was
[1:00:31] here, what he did when he was here on
[1:00:33] the earth, the same thing he's doing
[1:00:34] today.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Uh I think I'll be shocked now. And uh I
[1:00:42] want to thank brother Biscell and uh
[1:00:44] sister Biscll we had a talk with her
[1:00:46] that day the other day and we want to
[1:00:48] thank them for all the uh support that
[1:00:50] they have given us and uh they have
[1:00:53] really uh helped us in coming here. uh
[1:00:56] they they have said that we they'll
[1:00:57] extend a small house for us to stay in.
[1:01:00] So we are very grateful to them and uh
[1:01:02] may the Lord Jesus help us to relocate
[1:01:04] here and may the Lord Jesus bless
[1:01:06] brother Briscoll his family and you all
[1:01:10] lovely saints here.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you brother.
[1:01:22] My how I enjoyed that.
[1:01:24] People that you never knew you'd ever
[1:01:26] meet in this life and and uh and then
[1:01:29] you find out that you are indeed one.
[1:01:31] All connected. Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Well, let's just stand to our feet,
[1:01:35] shall we? And
[1:01:37] uh I'd like to just sing if that course
[1:01:41] I am redeemed. Anybody ask you who I am?
[1:01:51] Every day
[1:01:54] marked with the Christ.
[1:01:58] Jesus
[1:02:00] has saved my whole life.
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:07] [Applause]
[1:02:09] He ask you
[1:02:11] just who I am.
[1:02:15] Tell them
[1:02:18] I am redeemed. Let's just sing it once
[1:02:21] again, shall we? Oh, I am redeemed.
[1:02:28] One
[1:02:30] of Christ.
[1:02:32] Jesus
[1:02:34] has changed my whole life.
[1:02:40] If anybody
[1:02:43] asks you
[1:02:45] just who I am,
[1:02:49] tell them
[1:02:51] I am redeemed.
[1:02:56] How happy we are Lord to make that
[1:02:58] declaration.
[1:03:00] By your grace and by the provision that
[1:03:03] you made at Calvary, we can say, "I am
[1:03:07] redeemed, accepted in the beloved." Our
[1:03:11] ears, oh God, have heard glorious things
[1:03:14] as our brother Deepac has told us of his
[1:03:17] family and your dealing with them. We
[1:03:20] see how the sovereign God
[1:03:23] elects those that should hear and how oh
[1:03:27] God, it just seems that they're uh
[1:03:30] already ready for it. They're waiting
[1:03:32] for it. There's sheep waiting to hear
[1:03:35] the shepherd's call.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; We magnify your name and glorify your
[1:03:40] name for the great things you have done,
[1:03:43] the things you are doing, and the things
[1:03:45] you yet will do. open our eyes and our
[1:03:48] ears and our understanding. Now we pray
[1:03:51] in the name of Jesus Christ as we read
[1:03:53] the scripture. May the Holy Spirit, the
[1:03:56] author of the book, be also the
[1:03:59] interpreter of the book and be the
[1:04:01] speaker this morning in Jesus Christ's
[1:04:03] name. Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Isn't it good to
[1:04:08] have time to hear these wonderful
[1:04:11] things? Amen. We never weary of it. I'd
[1:04:14] like you to read quickly. Turn to
[1:04:16] Matthew 23, please.
[1:04:19] We're going to read from the 23rd verse
[1:04:22] of Matthew 23. Just a few verses.
[1:04:33] Matthew 23:23.
[1:04:36] Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees,
[1:04:38] hypocrites,
[1:04:40] for ye pay tithe of mint and annis and
[1:04:43] come and have omitted the weightier
[1:04:46] matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and
[1:04:50] faith. These ought ye to have done, and
[1:04:55] not to leave the other undone.
[1:04:58] Ye blind guides which strain at a gnat
[1:05:01] and swallow a camel. Woe unto you
[1:05:04] scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for
[1:05:07] ye may clean the outside of the cup and
[1:05:11] of the platter, but within they are full
[1:05:14] of extortion and excess.
[1:05:17] Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that
[1:05:21] which is within the cup and platter,
[1:05:24] that the outside of them may be clean
[1:05:27] also. Amen. God bless his word. as you
[1:05:30] have your saints.
[1:05:36] I don't expect I will finish this
[1:05:38] morning. So, I will go just as far as I
[1:05:40] feel the Lord will have me do. So, I
[1:05:43] want to speak to you on something that's
[1:05:47] uh quite a burden on my heart and that
[1:05:50] is weightier matters. Yeah.
[1:05:54] uh one of the burdens of
[1:05:57] our
[1:06:00] society,
[1:06:02] I would say one of the things that we
[1:06:04] contend with and I believe I can say
[1:06:07] very honestly everybody contends with
[1:06:10] this
[1:06:11] and that is that this generation
[1:06:16] has been
[1:06:19] completely seduced
[1:06:21] into a sense of false balance. balances.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Every area of our lives
[1:06:29] is permeated with false balances.
[1:06:33] And I would like to deal with some of
[1:06:35] those. I would like to just bring some
[1:06:38] of them to the surface.
[1:06:40] We're daily faced with decisions
[1:06:43] ourselves as individuals. Daily faced
[1:06:45] with decisions trying to decide between
[1:06:50] reality and falsehood.
[1:06:54] And yet we're caught in a web
[1:06:57] of this present day civilization
[1:07:00] that is actually based on false
[1:07:02] balances. The whole civilization is
[1:07:05] based on false balances.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Relationships
[1:07:11] are based upon those things that are not
[1:07:13] lasting
[1:07:16] and thus are not lasting. deep
[1:07:18] relationships.
[1:07:20] Many of them are based on the appearance
[1:07:22] of the other person. What's that got to
[1:07:25] do with it?
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; That's a false balance.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, how they, you know, how they spoke
[1:07:31] or or or or some other thing. It's it's
[1:07:34] a completely a false balance. and and
[1:07:37] very deep relationships
[1:07:39] have commenced on those I would say uh
[1:07:44] uh just such such uh shallow
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; very shallow
[1:07:52] uh foundation it can never last
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; and uh
[1:07:59] we base it upon
[1:08:02] uh relationship say with the church.
[1:08:06] They're based upon
[1:08:08] uh you know personalities.
[1:08:11] Uh someone oh we get along nicely with
[1:08:14] them. What's that got to do with it?
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual we're to be involved
[1:08:19] and led by a spiritual
[1:08:22] uh leadership.
[1:08:25] And uh we cannot have our relationships
[1:08:28] based upon compatibility
[1:08:31] or personalities or that we have a
[1:08:34] mutual interest. You know, this one's a
[1:08:36] farmer, that one's a farmer, so we get
[1:08:38] along good. Uh this one's a businessman,
[1:08:41] that one's a businessman, so we get
[1:08:43] along good. That has nothing to do with
[1:08:45] it.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; In the in the in the household of faith,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; it should be that the the farmer puts
[1:08:51] his arm around the businessman and vice
[1:08:54] versa. Uh it has nothing to do with what
[1:08:57] our profession is or what our you know
[1:08:59] our background is or let me get even
[1:09:02] closer you know uh uh I'm Ukrainian so
[1:09:07] there's a Ukrainian here and so we have
[1:09:09] we're great buddies. What's that based
[1:09:11] on?
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; I come from England. You come from
[1:09:14] England. I come from Germany. You come
[1:09:16] from Germany. So we're great partners
[1:09:18] because we all come from the same place.
[1:09:20] And what's that based on? We're brothers
[1:09:23] in Christ.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; The other starts to get into an
[1:09:30] emotional realm and it and there's no
[1:09:32] substance there for real relationship.
[1:09:36] Now, we're talking about a relationship
[1:09:38] in God.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; I don't like to hear the terms, well, we
[1:09:42] Canadians and you Americans,
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; where does that come from?
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Americans are here. The
[1:09:48] Canadians, who are they? How did that
[1:09:51] come to decide who we are? Who does that
[1:09:54] identify?
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; We're we're this, we're that. Well, we
[1:09:56] say, "Well, we're happy we're American.
[1:09:59] Well, God bless that. We're happy we're
[1:10:01] Canadian. God bless that." But that is
[1:10:03] very very shallow. We don't base any
[1:10:05] spiritual relationship on that.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; It is a matter, but it's a and and we
[1:10:13] don't ignore it, but it's not a weighty
[1:10:15] matter.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Should I take my glasses off?
[1:10:25] Now Jesus said
[1:10:28] he said uh
[1:10:31] you have omitted
[1:10:34] the weight of your matters. So I'm going
[1:10:36] to go slow. You have omitted the weight
[1:10:39] of your matters. And the word omitted is
[1:10:41] that you have left. At one time they did
[1:10:44] have the weight of your matters but you
[1:10:46] have left the weight of your matters. To
[1:10:49] omit them is to forsake them or to let
[1:10:52] them go or just to disregard them.
[1:10:58] They're there and we're aware of them,
[1:11:01] but we just disregard the weightier
[1:11:03] matters.
[1:11:06] To omit them is to not discuss them.
[1:11:11] This is not open for discussion.
[1:11:14] You know, we all have a little private
[1:11:17] part of our heart
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; and we all have a little private part of
[1:11:23] ourselves
[1:11:25] and some somehow we like to feel this
[1:11:28] isn't open for discussion.
[1:11:31] This is not open for discussion. This is
[1:11:34] my own private little part of my heart.
[1:11:38] But it might be a very very important
[1:11:40] part. It might be something that God is
[1:11:42] trying to touch that God wants to have a
[1:11:46] discussion with you about.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; To omit is to go away leaving something
[1:11:55] behind or to abandon it. We did have it.
[1:11:58] It was important at one time, but with
[1:12:01] time it became less important and less
[1:12:03] important. And the thing is it's not
[1:12:06] just that we leave something that is
[1:12:09] weightier or weighty matter and
[1:12:11] important but it is that we we acquire
[1:12:14] something else that's less important.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; To to omit something is to separate
[1:12:25] apart from the whole
[1:12:28] or any kind of a separation of that
[1:12:30] kind.
[1:12:32] Now
[1:12:33] it is striking to discover that after
[1:12:37] God led the children of Israel out of
[1:12:39] Egypt, he gave them commandments. And
[1:12:43] the first commandment is,
[1:12:46] "Thou shalt have no other gods before
[1:12:50] me." That was the first commandment.
[1:12:53] Thou shalt have no other gods, plural
[1:12:57] before me.
[1:12:59] The first the fourth word in the Bible
[1:13:01] is
[1:13:03] in the beginning God.
[1:13:07] And that God
[1:13:09] if in the scripture is Elohim
[1:13:14] and the scripture the word that's used
[1:13:16] for gods plural
[1:13:19] false gods through the scripture is also
[1:13:23] Elohim.
[1:13:25] So you shall not have any false Elohims.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; You shall not have anything that
[1:13:32] replaces the Elohim.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Because now we come into a state of uh
[1:13:39] responsibility for discernment. How was
[1:13:42] it that God should even say to them,
[1:13:45] "Thou shalt have no other gods. You
[1:13:47] shall have no other Elohims." There's a
[1:13:50] process that he was foreseeing that was
[1:13:53] going to take place within the minds of
[1:13:55] the people that would confuse them and
[1:13:58] displace the true God
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; or the weighty matter
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; for something much less important.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; And it's amazing to me today what has
[1:14:12] really replaced God in the hearts of the
[1:14:15] people
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; for nothing. for absolutely nothing.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; I have heard the lamest excuses.
[1:14:27] Many of you remember when brother Dan
[1:14:29] Daisley was here
[1:14:32] and he was preaching
[1:14:34] and he told of the pastor in the east I
[1:14:38] guess it was that noticed
[1:14:41] uh one of his members was not in church
[1:14:44] and he went out Sunday and walking down
[1:14:47] the street and he ran into him. Oh, he
[1:14:50] said uh missed you in church today. And
[1:14:54] the man says, "Yeah, I ran out of peanut
[1:14:56] butter."
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "What's that got to do with not
[1:15:02] being in church?" He says, "Absolutely
[1:15:04] nothing, but it's as good as any other
[1:15:05] excuse."
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; And that's about that's about how valid
[1:15:10] the excuse would have to be. He said it
[1:15:13] was just an excuse.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I I just want to go first into this
[1:15:21] uh for a few moments. Thou shalt have no
[1:15:24] other gods before me. And in the
[1:15:26] beginning, God created the same same
[1:15:28] word. Now, God according to uh the
[1:15:33] encyclopedia is the one supreme being,
[1:15:36] self-existent
[1:15:38] and eternal, the infinite creator,
[1:15:41] sustainer and ruler of the universe.
[1:15:45] He is a being regarded as possessing
[1:15:47] supernatural qualities and made as an
[1:15:51] object of worship. Notice that as
[1:15:53] brother Brandham says God is an object
[1:15:56] of worship and that's why he said
[1:15:58] there's was a time when God was not God
[1:16:02] because there was nothing to worship him
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; or
[1:16:08] also that he says the encyclopedia says
[1:16:11] of God that it can be any person or
[1:16:16] thing exalted as the chief good
[1:16:22] or made an object of supreme devotion.
[1:16:27] Anything that absorbs one's attention
[1:16:30] and aspirations
[1:16:32] as money is a god. They use that as an
[1:16:35] example.
[1:16:37] So a god can be anything
[1:16:41] that's exalted as the chief good. In
[1:16:44] other words, this is the chief important
[1:16:46] thing in a person's life or made an
[1:16:51] object of supreme devotion. And I have
[1:16:55] highlighted anything that absorbs one's
[1:16:59] attention
[1:17:01] or aspirations
[1:17:03] as money could be as God.
[1:17:09] Now
[1:17:12] in the mighty God unveiled,
[1:17:14] brother Brandham says this, in the
[1:17:16] beginning he wasn't even God.
[1:17:19] Now our English word today, God means an
[1:17:23] object of worship. Notice how he just
[1:17:25] used exactly the same phrase. God an
[1:17:29] object of worship. How confusing it is
[1:17:33] to the mind. He said you can make
[1:17:36] somebody a god. Encyclopedia Bratannica
[1:17:39] says a person can be a god.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Here's a prophet saying uh now I'm not
[1:17:44] having encyclopedia bratannica
[1:17:46] supporting brother Brandham. Brother
[1:17:47] Brandham states that as a prophet you
[1:17:49] could write all the books and whatever
[1:17:51] they would say wouldn't mean anything to
[1:17:52] me. But he said you can make somebody a
[1:17:55] god. You can make anything a god. But in
[1:18:00] the old testament Genesis 1 in the
[1:18:02] beginning god. He said the word that is
[1:18:04] used is Elohim which means a
[1:18:07] self-existing one. He said what a
[1:18:10] difference the word Elohim is to our
[1:18:12] word God.
[1:18:14] Elohim means a self-existing one. He
[1:18:17] said we cannot be self-existing. So now
[1:18:20] a person can be a god but they can't be
[1:18:23] Elohim. They can't be but but the
[1:18:26] scripture says thou shalt have no other
[1:18:28] gods. You shall have no other Elohims.
[1:18:30] In other words, the people in their
[1:18:32] minds, they have forsaken or omitted or
[1:18:36] left or departed the one and the one
[1:18:39] that is the the most important, the
[1:18:42] supreme being has been replaced with
[1:18:44] something else. And believe it or not,
[1:18:47] now we may smile at it. We may uh uh we
[1:18:50] may shake our heads and wag our heads at
[1:18:53] their utter ignorance and so on, but but
[1:18:56] let's not be too hasty because they took
[1:18:58] they took pieces of wood and carved it.
[1:19:02] They took metal, they took gold, they
[1:19:04] took different things and made them into
[1:19:07] gods. But I will say today, this
[1:19:09] generation takes things that are even
[1:19:12] less than a golden calf and turn them
[1:19:15] into gods because they replace God. They
[1:19:19] displace him for things that are empty,
[1:19:23] things that are vain, things that are
[1:19:26] absolutely worthless,
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; and displace God in their lives.
[1:19:35] He says, "We cannot be self-existent. We
[1:19:38] cannot be almighty. We cannot be
[1:19:40] omnipotent, omnisient, and omnipresent."
[1:19:44] That Elohim expresses all of that.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; We cannot be that. The tree that that
[1:19:51] you make a god out of or the building,
[1:19:54] it's not self-existing. This building
[1:19:57] does is not self-existing. We are not
[1:20:00] self-existing. there he said you can
[1:20:02] make the piano a god uh it's not
[1:20:05] self-existing
[1:20:06] you can m you can make it and it can
[1:20:08] take the place of Elohim in a person's
[1:20:11] life in other words the self-existing
[1:20:13] one is displaced for some meaningless
[1:20:18] piece of wood or some aspiration or some
[1:20:23] desire that a individual has and without
[1:20:28] uh without real caution we find that
[1:20:30] that begins to consume us
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; and displaces
[1:20:36] what is really important.
[1:20:41] So the Lord God in Genesis 2 and 7, the
[1:20:45] self-existent one,
[1:20:48] he that is who he is, the eternal I am.
[1:20:54] And I love this. I just want to share
[1:20:56] this with you even though it's not in
[1:20:58] direct uh relationship to what I'm
[1:21:00] speaking but I love what what God means
[1:21:03] in the in the scripture and in the
[1:21:05] Scoffield Bible. it the Jehovah the word
[1:21:08] Jehovah the title Jehovah comes also
[1:21:11] from the word hava h a va or h a w ah I
[1:21:16] believe but and from from which Jehovah
[1:21:19] is formed and hava signifies two things
[1:21:23] it also signifies to become and that is
[1:21:27] to become known so thus it points to and
[1:21:31] I love this I want to just leave it in
[1:21:33] your minds it points to a continu
[1:21:36] continuous a continuous and increasing
[1:21:41] selfrevelation.
[1:21:43] Now, now I'm I'm I'm referring to that
[1:21:45] and I'm emphasizing that because think
[1:21:48] of it, friends, as we go on in the
[1:21:50] service, think what think what there is
[1:21:53] in this society, in this generation that
[1:21:56] Satan is seeking to use to displace this
[1:22:00] one who wants to continuously
[1:22:03] and increasingly
[1:22:05] make himself known to you. But he he he
[1:22:09] is uh he's superseded by other things
[1:22:13] because other things impose themselves
[1:22:15] upon us in this kind of society. This is
[1:22:18] Satan's Eden.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; That's no surprise. This is Satan's
[1:22:22] Eden. He's designed the whole thing.
[1:22:24] He's designed an educational program. We
[1:22:27] have to be educated. He's designed the
[1:22:30] fashion world, but we have to be
[1:22:32] clothed. He's designed the whole
[1:22:34] political system, but we have to be
[1:22:36] citizens of a country. He's designed the
[1:22:39] whole the whole operation civilization
[1:22:42] of which we're members of it. But he's
[1:22:45] designed it. And so we have to walk
[1:22:47] through with the wisdom of the Holy
[1:22:49] Spirit so we can continually discern
[1:22:53] what is God and what is not of God.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need a constant daily
[1:23:01] discernment of the Holy Spirit in our
[1:23:04] lives. If not, we'll be swallowed up.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; And Satan will certainly is willing to
[1:23:09] impose what he thinks we should be, what
[1:23:12] he thinks we should be doing, how he
[1:23:14] thinks we should speak, how he thinks we
[1:23:16] should act.
[1:23:19] And so that would rob us of this
[1:23:22] continual continuous and everinccreasing
[1:23:26] self-revelation
[1:23:28] of God. Now
[1:23:31] as I read the scripture also God began
[1:23:34] to warn his children very very early
[1:23:38] as soon as he'd called them out.
[1:23:41] And his first commandment is, "And God
[1:23:44] spake all these words, saying,"
[1:23:47] Exodus 20. You don't have to turn to it.
[1:23:49] I'm just reading two or three
[1:23:50] scriptures. And God spake all these
[1:23:53] words, saying, here's his words right
[1:23:56] from Sinai. I am the Lord thy God. Don't
[1:24:00] make any mistake about this. I am the
[1:24:02] Lord thy God, which brought you out of
[1:24:05] the land of Egypt and out of the house
[1:24:08] of bondage. and you shall have no other
[1:24:10] gods. I'm the Elohim that brought you
[1:24:13] out and you'll have no other Elohims
[1:24:16] because there is no other Elohims. But
[1:24:18] he knew that that in that Satan in his
[1:24:21] program and all the other heathen
[1:24:23] nations would impose upon the people
[1:24:26] their gods, their form of worship, their
[1:24:28] idea of how life should be. Right.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt, he goes on, thou shalt
[1:24:36] not make any graven images or likeness
[1:24:40] of anything that is in heaven above
[1:24:42] earth and in earth beneath or that is in
[1:24:45] the water under the earth. You'll make
[1:24:47] no images because as I said here a few
[1:24:50] weeks ago, because as soon as you make
[1:24:52] an image, you have defined what you
[1:24:55] think God is. And that does away from
[1:24:59] his basic character which is an
[1:25:01] everinccreasing
[1:25:03] revelation of himself.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; How can you fix something and have it
[1:25:08] ever increasing? And that is why
[1:25:10] denominations are not of God because a
[1:25:14] denomination structures its belief and
[1:25:17] its creeds, its traditions or whatever
[1:25:19] more structures its articles of belief
[1:25:22] and this is what we believe. And when
[1:25:24] they say that then they have defined God
[1:25:28] and God departs it
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; immediately departs it
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; because you have defined him. Thou shalt
[1:25:36] make no other gods. It if you if you
[1:25:39] this is God
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; and this has been spoken by the prophets
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; and the words of the prophets because
[1:25:47] they are not the words of Isaiah,
[1:25:49] Jeremiah, Ezekiel or anyone else. They
[1:25:52] are the words of God himself. And the
[1:25:54] words that come out of your mouth bear
[1:25:56] your character.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; They have something to say about who you
[1:26:00] are. And when the word of God came out,
[1:26:03] the very breath of God came out of the
[1:26:05] mouth of the prophets, it bore the
[1:26:07] character of God. And that is why Isaiah
[1:26:10] could say, "Behold, a virgin shall
[1:26:12] conceive." And that word continues to
[1:26:14] unfold, unfold, unfold. It's not a
[1:26:17] paperback book in the bookstore. A
[1:26:20] paperback book in the bookstore says
[1:26:23] says a certain statement, that's it. It
[1:26:25] can go no further because it's been
[1:26:27] written by a man or a woman comes out of
[1:26:30] their brain, out of their imagination,
[1:26:32] and that's it. It will not expand and
[1:26:34] expand. But when God speaks,
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, it just keeps on rolling
[1:26:41] through time and it keeps uh it keeps
[1:26:44] expanding in its dimension and in its
[1:26:47] glory. Hallelujah.
[1:26:50] A virgin shall conceive. It meant very
[1:26:53] little perhaps to the people. It was
[1:26:54] just a startling statement. A virgin
[1:26:56] shall conceive. Imagine the scribe that
[1:26:59] scribed it for Isaiah. He probably
[1:27:01] thought that is a strange statement. But
[1:27:04] I know this is a vindicated prophet of
[1:27:07] God and I will write it down. I believe
[1:27:09] it.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Then think what it meant to the
[1:27:13] disciples.
[1:27:14] Isaiah didn't have to come back and
[1:27:16] explain it. They didn't have to have
[1:27:18] another preacher to tell it. It just
[1:27:20] expanded in its depth and its meaning.
[1:27:22] 30 years later, it meant so much more.
[1:27:25] Here we are 2,000 years beyond that and
[1:27:28] it's expanded further and further and
[1:27:30] further. We say, "Oh, how glorious it
[1:27:32] is. A virgin conceived
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; and the one became our savior and he
[1:27:38] became sin and I'm accepted in the
[1:27:40] beloved." Glory, glory to the one who
[1:27:43] came
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; by that birth. Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt have no other Elohims before
[1:27:52] me. In the message bomb and Gilead,
[1:27:56] notice it says, "Is there not a bomb in
[1:27:58] Gilead?"
[1:28:00] That was the question. Brother Brandham
[1:28:02] picks it up and says, "It wasn't because
[1:28:04] there wasn't a God in Israel."
[1:28:07] It was not because there was not a God
[1:28:10] in Israel. Neither was it because there
[1:28:12] wasn't a prophet in Israel. But it was
[1:28:16] the king's stubbornness and his hatred
[1:28:19] for the true prophet of Israel.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; It wasn't because that God hadn't
[1:28:23] supplied a remedy.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; It was because he was too stubborn and
[1:28:28] he didn't like Elijah because Elijah had
[1:28:31] predicted all the evil that had happened
[1:28:34] to his father. Therefore, he had created
[1:28:38] by the habits of his home to hate the
[1:28:41] man of God and to despise him and reject
[1:28:44] him.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; He says, "And if you reject," and here's
[1:28:48] what I want you to catch. If you reject
[1:28:50] the true and living God, there's only
[1:28:54] only
[1:28:56] one other thing you can do, and that's
[1:28:59] an untrue God
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; or a false god.
[1:29:05] When the true God is rejected, the only
[1:29:08] thing that's left is a false god.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; If this people of this nation,
[1:29:16] speaking of the nation he was in,
[1:29:18] speaking in Chicago, refuses to serve
[1:29:22] the true and living God, there's only
[1:29:25] one thing left for them to accept.
[1:29:27] That's the false God. Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; If there is a true religion of Jehovah
[1:29:34] and people refuse to walk in that
[1:29:36] religious order, then there's only one
[1:29:39] thing for them to do, and that's to find
[1:29:42] some other false way to walk in it.
[1:29:46] Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; In the message, we would see Jesus
[1:29:53] says, "Whenever you pick a bogus dollar,
[1:29:56] whenever you pick up a bogus dollar and
[1:29:58] look at that bogus dollar,
[1:30:01] we have quite a few floating around
[1:30:03] here." I understand. Fact is, I had a US
[1:30:07] here and I I can't hardly get rid of it
[1:30:09] because everybody says we don't take
[1:30:11] them anymore.
[1:30:12] I said, "Well, that's amazing. you go
[1:30:14] overseas and that's all they want to
[1:30:15] take. And here I come over here and I
[1:30:18] can't even hardly get rid of them
[1:30:21] because they want to they don't have the
[1:30:22] equipment to examine them. There's too
[1:30:24] many bogus. But the prophet is saying
[1:30:26] when you see a bogus dollar just you
[1:30:30] just remember that that bogus dollar is
[1:30:33] made off of an original.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; For if there was no genuine dollar, then
[1:30:39] the bogus dollar would be the original
[1:30:41] copy.
[1:30:44] So, as long as you see somebody
[1:30:46] impersonating or playing the part of
[1:30:49] hypocrite, just remember there's a
[1:30:52] genuine Christian somewhere.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Somebody says, "I'm not going to church
[1:30:58] cuz it's too full of hypocrites." I say,
[1:31:00] "You hypocrite. You're a bigger
[1:31:01] hypocrite than all the rest of them."
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; How can you not go to church cuz there's
[1:31:06] hypocrites?
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Well, then if you're so good, go there
[1:31:09] and correct the thing. At least we'd
[1:31:11] have somebody there that'd be on B on
[1:31:13] track.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; No. Hallelujah.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; If there's a hypocrite, you can be serve
[1:31:22] one thing. Serve one thing. There's a
[1:31:25] genuine somewhere.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Genuine Christian somewhere. I want to
[1:31:30] be that one.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; I want to be that one. You want to be
[1:31:33] that one.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:31:37] we started right at the very beginning.
[1:31:41] In the beginning, God. And then the
[1:31:43] first commandment, thou shalt have no
[1:31:46] other gods.
[1:31:48] If you were to go home today and read
[1:31:51] Malachi,
[1:31:53] the last book of the New Testament,
[1:31:57] it just took on whole new
[1:32:01] dimensions to me
[1:32:04] as I began to study.
[1:32:06] And I don't even know how I arrived
[1:32:08] there. I really can't tell you how I
[1:32:10] arrived there, but in my studies, I
[1:32:14] began to read Malachi,
[1:32:16] this last Old Testament prophet that
[1:32:18] prophesied. And he prophesied of a time
[1:32:21] when the people would be in desperate
[1:32:24] need of being restored back to the one
[1:32:28] true God.
[1:32:30] both Jews and Gentiles
[1:32:33] would need the same spirit of Elijah to
[1:32:35] restore them back to the one true God
[1:32:38] and to his word. And I'm going to give
[1:32:41] you some selected scriptures out of
[1:32:43] Malachi that will just kind of set the
[1:32:45] set the pattern here.
[1:32:49] Malachi Jesus said, "But you've omitted
[1:32:54] the weightier matters." Malachi says,
[1:32:56] "But you're departed out of the way."
[1:32:59] He's speaking now to the whole the whole
[1:33:02] nation. But you have departed out of the
[1:33:05] way. You have caused many to stumble at
[1:33:07] the law. You have corrupted the covenant
[1:33:10] of Levi, says the Lord of hosts. And now
[1:33:14] I'd like you to notice the last verse
[1:33:16] before
[1:33:18] before the scripture that foretells the
[1:33:21] coming of Elijah in the form of John the
[1:33:24] Baptist. Notice the last scripture. It's
[1:33:27] Malachi 2:17.
[1:33:30] And he says, "You have wearied the Lord
[1:33:33] with your words. And yet you say, now
[1:33:36] notice I I I'm going to be speaking
[1:33:39] again on this because there was just so
[1:33:40] much for me to try to cover. I was very
[1:33:44] very keenly interested in many things
[1:33:46] that Malachi was saying on behalf of God
[1:33:49] or God was saying through Malachi
[1:33:51] because it is one place where God keeps
[1:33:53] saying, "But you say and I thought
[1:33:55] that's amazing.
[1:33:57] You know what? What was it that the
[1:34:00] people said that caught God's attention?
[1:34:03] And he says, "But you say,
[1:34:07] wherein have we wearied him?" They
[1:34:09] didn't know, "Wherein have we wearied
[1:34:11] him?" And then God responds when you say
[1:34:15] everyone that doeth evil is good in the
[1:34:20] sight of the Lord and he delightth in
[1:34:24] them or this is what he's saying. This
[1:34:26] is what the people were saying or where
[1:34:29] is the God of judgment.
[1:34:32] Now this is a very important part right
[1:34:35] now I'm coming to because soon as we say
[1:34:37] the word judgment people start thinking
[1:34:38] about judgment the severity of God and
[1:34:42] God coming down in and swift and
[1:34:44] judgment in the term of punishment but
[1:34:46] and and that is part of it but I I want
[1:34:49] to take your thought uh directed away
[1:34:52] from that just for a moment because what
[1:34:55] God is saying here you have said that
[1:34:58] everyone that doeth evil is good in the
[1:35:01] sight of the Lord. Now, I want to tie
[1:35:02] that right into the scripture where
[1:35:04] Jesus said, "You have omitted the
[1:35:06] weightier matters." And and now notice
[1:35:09] he said uh uh mint and annis and common,
[1:35:15] three spices. The mint they even threw
[1:35:18] on the floor to fragrance the house. The
[1:35:21] mint, the anus, and the common. Three,
[1:35:25] three spices, three fragrances. And over
[1:35:28] here, here you have mint. And here he
[1:35:31] has judgment.
[1:35:34] Here you have annis. And here you have
[1:35:38] mercy.
[1:35:40] And here you have common. And over here
[1:35:42] you have faith. Excuse me.
[1:35:46] Is there any comparison in those? But
[1:35:49] the people had been reduced to that
[1:35:51] level where they had actually omitted.
[1:35:54] They allowed judgment. And the judgment
[1:35:57] he's talking about is this what I'm
[1:35:59] referring to right here. They they they
[1:36:02] lost their ability to determine between
[1:36:06] what was actually evil and what was
[1:36:09] actually correct, what was wrong and
[1:36:12] what is right, what's acceptable and
[1:36:15] what's not acceptable. That was the
[1:36:17] judgment. They lost the capability of
[1:36:20] making that sound decision. And that is
[1:36:23] why they finally had accepted uh mint
[1:36:27] somehow became mint. I don't know. It's
[1:36:29] not in our society, but I can tell you
[1:36:31] things I can tell you things that are
[1:36:33] more that are that that are more idiotic
[1:36:35] than mint.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; At at least mint's in the Bible, but a
[1:36:40] hockey puck's not in the Bible.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; A baseball is not in the Bible.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; A basketball is not in the Bible.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:51] all kinds of other pleasurable things
[1:36:53] that people do. A can of beer is not in
[1:36:56] the Bible,
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; but people people have those things have
[1:37:01] taken precedent
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; over.
[1:37:06] Hey, I'm talking about real things. Your
[1:37:09] newspaper tomorrow morning or this
[1:37:12] weekend will be absolutely filled with
[1:37:16] the sports page
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; of all kinds of activities and
[1:37:20] multitudes of people and churches are
[1:37:22] shutting down so they can go to these
[1:37:24] activities.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; You can be quiet if you want,
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; but we're going to we're going to stay
[1:37:37] with it.
[1:37:39] I'm going to stay on track.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; At least they had a at least they had
[1:37:46] reason to have mint and anis coming
[1:37:49] because they were part of the scripture.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; But they allowed something in the
[1:37:53] scripture to take precedence over it and
[1:37:55] it suddenly became it became the main
[1:37:59] thing
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; for whatever reason. It became the main
[1:38:02] thing.
[1:38:07] Now
[1:38:12] they had arrived I would say at a time
[1:38:15] as it is today power to discern right
[1:38:18] from wrong good or evil clean from
[1:38:22] unclean had vacated have today in this
[1:38:26] present time vacated the minds of the
[1:38:29] people.
[1:38:30] The prophet of Malachi 4 will restore,
[1:38:35] the scripture declares it, will restore
[1:38:39] the children back to the original faith.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Not back to the original mint
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; or back to the original common or back
[1:38:48] to the original annis, but back to the
[1:38:50] original faith.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; That which is of substance. Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Who wants some material thing if I have
[1:38:57] if I have a a channel open to me that
[1:39:01] reaches into an unseen dimension that
[1:39:04] can actually bring things down and
[1:39:06] materialize them in front of me. What
[1:39:08] good is some material thing
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; that can't heal me,
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; can't bring peace to my soul,
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; but I have access by faith
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; to another realm. where we can lay hold
[1:39:25] of the promise of God and bring it down
[1:39:28] into my life and and say it work.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; How can that compare with some other
[1:39:37] thing that is uh not even genuine or
[1:39:40] real
[1:39:44] to the faith that's once delivered to
[1:39:46] the saints.
[1:39:48] Now,
[1:39:50] there would be no need of a restoring
[1:39:53] ministry if there was nothing to
[1:39:55] restore.
[1:39:57] There would be no need of a restoring
[1:39:59] ministry if there had been nothing lost.
[1:40:03] I want to say to you people very very
[1:40:05] quickly this generation this Leodysian
[1:40:08] age and we are in a bride age but the
[1:40:11] Leodysian age had lost not only lost
[1:40:16] something but I say they lost the
[1:40:18] essence of life.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; They lost the very essence of godliness
[1:40:22] and holiness and sobriety and those
[1:40:25] things which are so so important to our
[1:40:29] lives. This generation had lost it.
[1:40:31] Anybody who has found it, you have found
[1:40:33] it only because of the grace of God
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; to your own personal life. It's been
[1:40:39] God's personal grace to you that has
[1:40:42] restored it back.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; And you are a privileged people.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; We are.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; I feel privileged. I hope you do.
[1:40:55] And so the question arises
[1:40:57] if this generation
[1:41:02] had so lost the faith the original faith
[1:41:06] my question is did the faith depart the
[1:41:09] children or did the children depart the
[1:41:12] faith
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; and I'll answer that by saying the
[1:41:15] children departed the faith
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; and that is what Jesus is speaking about
[1:41:20] you have omitted you have left you have
[1:41:22] walked walked away from that which is
[1:41:25] that that which is so significant and
[1:41:28] important.
[1:41:30] Now,
[1:41:31] we certainly need
[1:41:34] I say the leadership
[1:41:36] of the Holy Spirit in our lives
[1:41:39] so that we can discern between
[1:41:42] the gods.
[1:41:44] I've called it the gods of Leodysia
[1:41:51] and they are certainly present with us.
[1:41:54] The gods of Leodysia.
[1:42:03] judgment.
[1:42:10] God spoke to I need to lay this uh this
[1:42:15] foundation. It's quite a broad
[1:42:17] foundation in order for me to bring my
[1:42:19] point and I'm not going to try to cover
[1:42:21] it. I'm going to finish in about 15
[1:42:23] minutes.
[1:42:26] God spoke in Deuteronomy
[1:42:29] and he said, "And it shall be,
[1:42:34] if thou if thou do at all forget the
[1:42:38] Lord thy God and walk after other gods
[1:42:43] and serve them and worship them, I
[1:42:46] testify against you this day that you
[1:42:49] shall surely perish." In other words, if
[1:42:52] you forget, if you ignore, say, I'm not
[1:42:56] I'm not suggesting this morning to this
[1:42:58] congregation here, uh, that our love has
[1:43:02] abaded. But, but I am suggesting that
[1:43:06] Satan will do everything that he can
[1:43:08] within his within the scope of his
[1:43:11] devices.
[1:43:13] And we do not want to be ignorant. the
[1:43:16] his approach to Eve was that the thing
[1:43:20] that he was offering her was essential
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; was necessary
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; and that is where the danger is because
[1:43:31] we are living in a society we live in an
[1:43:33] age when there's all kinds of things
[1:43:36] that are essential.
[1:43:39] Education is essential.
[1:43:42] Our profession is essential. Our jobs
[1:43:45] are necessary. We must have an income.
[1:43:48] That's essential. But but Satan takes
[1:43:52] those things which we already have. He
[1:43:56] took something that Eve already had and
[1:43:59] promised her something further
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; in the same realm of what she already
[1:44:03] had. And that was the snare. And so
[1:44:07] today we have a we have uh I will say
[1:44:11] you know whether it be the whole
[1:44:13] spectrum of our lives whatever it is you
[1:44:16] have a job you have a profession you
[1:44:18] some of you being educated you're going
[1:44:20] to education and so on and so forth and
[1:44:23] there is a realm where all of that is
[1:44:25] essential
[1:44:27] and necessary
[1:44:29] but my my message to you this morning is
[1:44:32] that Satan will take that which is
[1:44:35] necessary neessary and seek to extend
[1:44:38] that to the purpose of essentially
[1:44:41] swallowing you up
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; and having you begin to serve that which
[1:44:47] is to be intended to be your servant.
[1:44:50] You become its slave.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And worship,
[1:44:55] you'll be quiet now. Worship actually is
[1:44:58] bowing
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; and being in obedience
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; to some other power.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; And I say those all uh education. Now
[1:45:12] some may misunderstand me. I say get all
[1:45:14] the education you can but it must never
[1:45:16] run you.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Have the best job you can be promoted as
[1:45:22] high as you can but it must never run
[1:45:23] you. It must never tell you how you're
[1:45:26] going to serve God
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; and who you're going to worship. You're
[1:45:30] going to tell it who you're going to
[1:45:31] worship.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Say, "I worship the one true God and you
[1:45:35] can never be my God."
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; You can be my business, but you can
[1:45:39] never be my God. You can be my
[1:45:41] profession, but you can never be my God.
[1:45:44] You can be my educator, but you can
[1:45:46] never be my God. You can be a
[1:45:48] pleasurable thing to me, but you can
[1:45:50] never be my God. I love to get out in
[1:45:52] the woods, but you can never be my God.
[1:45:55] Hallelujah.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you get another Elohim
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; and the Elohim becomes displaced.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; So now judgment in the in the word that
[1:46:16] is used here, you have omitted, you have
[1:46:20] omitted judgment. and they left. And
[1:46:22] that is it will be an easy word in the
[1:46:24] Greek for you to remember. It's crisis.
[1:46:27] And if you certainly lose your judgment,
[1:46:32] you'll be in a crisis.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; And the judgment is primarily it denotes
[1:46:38] a separating and then a decision. A
[1:46:42] separating a a a discerning. In other
[1:46:44] words, a judgment you have to decide
[1:46:46] between this and between that. And once
[1:46:49] you decide between the once you discern
[1:46:52] between the two you look at them two and
[1:46:54] then you choose one. Then comes a
[1:46:56] decision.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Should I do this or should I do that?
[1:47:02] See
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; and when you do you have to think which
[1:47:06] one is the true God honoring.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; And then you must make your choice with
[1:47:13] him.
[1:47:18] So then comes a decision which is
[1:47:21] essentially a judgment. When you make a
[1:47:23] a decision, you know that you you're
[1:47:25] familiar with the the term a judgment
[1:47:28] call. You have to make a judgment call.
[1:47:31] I'm going to take this. I'm going to do
[1:47:33] this. I'm not going to do that. And
[1:47:35] these are the reasons I'm not going to
[1:47:37] do it for whatever is the reason. It
[1:47:40] might be legal. It might not even be
[1:47:42] sinful. It doesn't have to be. It
[1:47:45] becomes wrong.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; The judgment is a an opinion or
[1:47:53] discerning
[1:47:55] decision given especially concerning
[1:47:58] justice and injustice, right or wrong.
[1:48:00] That's what judgment is. It's an opinion
[1:48:03] about uh given especially concerning
[1:48:07] justice or injustice or something that
[1:48:09] is right or wrong. And sentence is a
[1:48:13] condemnation or a judgment or punishment
[1:48:15] that can be the end of it. And that is
[1:48:17] why judgment for example in the Bible we
[1:48:20] have a number of scriptures and the
[1:48:22] Bible says in Exodus 12:12 and uh death
[1:48:26] angel I'll pass through the land of
[1:48:28] Egypt this night and I'll smite all the
[1:48:30] firstborn in the land of Egypt both man
[1:48:32] and beast and against all the gods all
[1:48:35] the gods of Egypt and I will execute
[1:48:38] judgment. I am the Lord. He was saying,
[1:48:41] "I'm now he's not deciding whether Egypt
[1:48:44] is right or wrong." That's long past.
[1:48:48] They had enslaved God's people and God
[1:48:51] God had had concluded that they were
[1:48:53] under the sentence of God. And now he
[1:48:55] came to execute that punishment.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; And now the death angel, he had spoke to
[1:49:00] them through his prophet Moses. And
[1:49:02] brother Brandham says God was in Moses
[1:49:03] and Satan was in Pharaoh.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; And that battle went on on earth between
[1:49:08] those two. And then God said, "Now I'll
[1:49:11] execute judgment tonight. The death
[1:49:13] angel's going to pass through the land."
[1:49:15] That was punishment. That was judgment.
[1:49:17] But that was not judgment in the sense
[1:49:18] that I am bringing it an opinion or a
[1:49:22] decision that's given between what is
[1:49:24] just as what is injustice or what is
[1:49:26] right is what is wrong. So uh now we
[1:49:30] come to this part decisions. When we
[1:49:34] allow anything
[1:49:36] what I said earlier
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; to take the place in our heart that
[1:49:42] supersedes God,
[1:49:44] his word or his interests
[1:49:48] or the interest of his kingdom.
[1:49:53] Then we have another god.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; We have another god. And a person may
[1:49:59] say now I don't worship I don't worship
[1:50:03] uh you know I don't worship sports or I
[1:50:05] don't worship my education or I don't
[1:50:07] worship my business or I don't worship
[1:50:09] my job or I don't worship but if you
[1:50:12] allow listen only by neglect
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; just by neglect
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; it's not that a person makes a decision
[1:50:20] say now I'm going to serve this god of
[1:50:22] education I'm done with this god you
[1:50:24] know the one true god no Israel never
[1:50:26] said that Israel never said, "I'm done
[1:50:29] with Jehovah." He said, "We love
[1:50:31] Jehovah."
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; But they had a loud religion.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; How many How many churches today I I
[1:50:37] drove past a church, you know, uh
[1:50:39] yesterday, and on their church billboard
[1:50:42] sign was happy to their coffee worship
[1:50:44] something, coffee worship time.
[1:50:51] I don't know whether it's true or not,
[1:50:52] but sounds to me like they got a god
[1:50:55] called Starbucks.
[1:50:58] Amen.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Because they have to have to offer that
[1:51:02] to get the people into the church. I say
[1:51:04] those people don't know God.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; You don't know God if that's what you
[1:51:08] need. If you need to come here so you
[1:51:10] have coffee and have a social and if we
[1:51:11] design everything. Oh, we got something
[1:51:13] for the children and something for this
[1:51:14] and something for the young people and
[1:51:15] something and that's why you come here
[1:51:17] then I say we come here for the wrong
[1:51:19] purpose.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; We come here for the wrong purpose
[1:51:21] whatsoever. We come here first primarily
[1:51:24] to worship God and God is this word
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; and we hear it and we are touched by the
[1:51:30] Holy Spirit. We say that is my God.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; And what he says I will do.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; I love what he says.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; When we allow anything to take the place
[1:51:45] of God in our heart and displace him or
[1:51:48] supersedes him and the rest the what
[1:51:51] what we how God became displaced is that
[1:51:54] he he just was less important
[1:51:57] as time went on and as Satan saw to it
[1:52:01] that there was plenty to crowd in and it
[1:52:03] became less important. The meetings
[1:52:06] became less important. Reading the
[1:52:08] scripture became less important. Hearing
[1:52:10] a message tape became less important. It
[1:52:12] just become less important. Less
[1:52:15] important.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, my I haven't I
[1:52:21] haven't had much time for God lately."
[1:52:24] Oh,
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; what's been crowding him out?
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; What's been crowding him out? Oh, well,
[1:52:35] it's, you know, it's just this and it's
[1:52:36] just that and it's just the other thing.
[1:52:38] Well, let me give that other thing a
[1:52:39] name, Elohim,
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; because it starts to get you to bow to
[1:52:46] it.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, there is really no
[1:52:53] limit. The intent of Satan is to take
[1:52:56] whatever he can and extinguish and
[1:52:59] squeeze out
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; because he despises
[1:53:05] the one true God
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; who is the Elohim, the only Elohim. And
[1:53:11] furthermore, he didn't say, "Thou shalt
[1:53:13] have no other god before me. Thou sh no
[1:53:16] other gods."
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Because there are many out there to do
[1:53:21] that.
[1:53:24] May I go on a few minutes?
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Just another few minutes, please.
[1:53:32] Many forms of pleasures
[1:53:35] are gods in Israel. Many forms of
[1:53:38] pleasures.
[1:53:40] Now, this doesn't all apply to the
[1:53:42] congregation necessarily, but it's
[1:53:44] things for us to be very cautious about.
[1:53:47] We are in a star star crazed generation.
[1:53:53] Everybody's got some stars,
[1:53:55] got some heroes.
[1:54:02] I'm going to be pretty straightforward.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; We may not even realize it, but you
[1:54:09] know, we end up being influenced by
[1:54:11] somebody.
[1:54:14] And I will say to our ladies and our
[1:54:16] young people and our young ladies for
[1:54:18] example,
[1:54:20] I can tell you that it is not some wash
[1:54:24] woman
[1:54:26] or workw woman or some household mother
[1:54:31] that is setting the fashions for this
[1:54:34] day and age.
[1:54:36] It is some floozy
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; that you would not want as a neighbor
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; that is setting the fashions
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; for the whole industry.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Whether it be your blouse or your skirt
[1:54:49] or your shoes or whatever it is that you
[1:54:52] wear. And men, I'll say the same thing.
[1:54:54] It says, uh, you know, get, uh, well,
[1:54:57] they've got all kinds of names for them.
[1:54:59] And I'm not closline preaching, but I
[1:55:02] want to tell you that there is a God of
[1:55:04] fashion.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; There is a God of fashion that has come
[1:55:09] forward here in Leodysa and has th and
[1:55:12] is as absolutely evident everywhere. And
[1:55:15] you cannot escape it in the restaurant.
[1:55:18] You can't escape it on the street. You
[1:55:20] can go down to a place that is the most
[1:55:22] restful. And I like to go down and walk
[1:55:25] along White Rock, but it's amazing. The
[1:55:27] devil likes White Rock also.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; But you know what? I deny him the right
[1:55:33] to impose that I can't be there. I said,
[1:55:36] "You foul enemy. You go and do what you
[1:55:38] want. You're bringing these you bring
[1:55:40] these men and these women down into
[1:55:43] condemnation, but I am refusing to allow
[1:55:46] you to rob me of of a of a little single
[1:55:49] pleasure life that I come and walk down
[1:55:52] here. you want to throw all these uh
[1:55:54] half-dressed people around here, then
[1:55:56] they they will have their own judgment.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; And I think there needs to be a good
[1:56:02] testimony of somebody that's godly
[1:56:03] dressed. And once in a while, you see
[1:56:05] one and you're it's a pleasure to see
[1:56:07] them.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; This isn't Satan's world. This is his
[1:56:13] this is his age, Satan's Eden. But the
[1:56:17] earth has already been bought by my
[1:56:19] savior.
[1:56:21] Jesus dropped his blood on it. Don't
[1:56:23] forget, we own the earth
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; through Christ. We own the earth. It
[1:56:28] belongs to us
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; and you but you can't escape it. I don't
[1:56:32] care where you walk, where you walk into
[1:56:33] a mall, walk down the street, walk any
[1:56:36] place, it's there. It's in front of your
[1:56:38] face. All the rest of it. I say what we
[1:56:40] are. It's the gods of
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Leodysia.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; You turn on to hear the news. You just
[1:56:50] want to We don't have a radio one in our
[1:56:52] place, but we'll turn it on, maybe hear
[1:56:54] the news. I'll hear it while I'm still
[1:56:55] in bed in the morning, catch the news,
[1:56:58] and you got to have the the Hollywood
[1:56:59] Minute. Says,
[1:57:03] "What in this earth? What in creation
[1:57:06] makes a couple of people believe that
[1:57:09] the whole world is interested in which
[1:57:11] marriage this person is now in and which
[1:57:14] divorce they're in, and who's shacking
[1:57:16] up with who. I couldn't care less. It's
[1:57:19] all adulterous.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; The whole thing's total adulterous.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; But they are imposing it that the whole
[1:57:26] world wants to know who's with who and
[1:57:30] who's leaving who
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; it's satanic.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Absolutely satanic.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; And it's their style of life that Satan
[1:57:43] would like to this is the way to be,
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; you know.
[1:57:51] I think we ought to stay away
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; from any of the thing that the world you
[1:57:57] see that the world is suddenly, you
[1:57:59] know, putting it forward that this is
[1:58:00] important. You need to hear this. You
[1:58:03] need to look like this. This is the cool
[1:58:04] thing to do. This is the end thing to
[1:58:06] do. I stay away from the cool thing.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, you're an old stogy." Well,
[1:58:13] be a young stogy.
[1:58:24] There's not a sin in education.
[1:58:27] There's not a sin in a profession.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; There isn't sin in books.
[1:58:33] Uh you might think I'm going east and
[1:58:34] west here.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; If I had a hockey puck here or I had a
[1:58:38] baseball here, there's no sin in either
[1:58:39] one of them.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; It's what they become
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; to the people. I could have all the
[1:58:46] books of learning here. I could have all
[1:58:48] the history books and all the
[1:58:50] mathematics and all the rest of there's
[1:58:52] no sin in those books.
[1:58:56] You could take a television
[1:58:59] sit here as a cold machine unplugged.
[1:59:01] There's no sin in that
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; in all of its pieces and bits and parts
[1:59:06] and whatever. There's no sin in it. It's
[1:59:08] what man has made of it.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; It's what man puts in it. It's what man
[1:59:13] distributes to it.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; There's no sin in a computer, per se,
[1:59:17] but look what the world is doing with
[1:59:18] it. They're very dangerous things.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Very dangerous things. To the point is
[1:59:24] some people shouldn't have them.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Some people shouldn't have them.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; And we don't have to have a television.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Not at all.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; If you want to use it as a monitor,
[1:59:34] fine. But and there's no sin in it. But
[1:59:37] it's what it becomes to you.
[1:59:42] So, I hope that you're able to follow me
[1:59:44] through.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; The Bible doesn't say
[1:59:55] that money is the
[1:59:57] is the that that it is the source of the
[2:00:00] root of all evil. It says the love of
[2:00:02] it.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; It's what you make out of it.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; And that by loving it, you begin to
[2:00:07] serve it.
[2:00:10] and that becomes evil. Then it becomes a
[2:00:12] god and it's a cruel god.
[2:00:20] So I've got, you know, I've covered
[2:00:22] business and a profession and a
[2:00:24] business. What about friends?
[2:00:27] What about relationships?
[2:00:29] Do you know? Do you know how many people
[2:00:32] I have dealt with? I'm talking about
[2:00:36] mothers and fathers and parents
[2:00:39] and they cannot break that emotional tie
[2:00:42] with their children.
[2:00:44] And their children are hellbent.
[2:00:48] And they're going to let that child
[2:00:50] begin to dictate to them what they can
[2:00:52] do and when they can go to church and
[2:00:55] when they can't go to church and when
[2:00:57] and when they can serve God and when
[2:00:59] they can't serve God. that you you you
[2:01:02] may not understand what I'm going to say
[2:01:03] now, but if you allow that, you're
[2:01:05] starting to bow to it and that child
[2:01:08] becomes an Elohim
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; becomes a false god
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; to that parent
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; or vice versa
[2:01:19] or wife to husband or husband to wife.
[2:01:23] It becomes a false god. And because what
[2:01:26] now I described God just a wee bit. How
[2:01:28] do we take how do we take a human
[2:01:31] relationship here and somehow, you know,
[2:01:35] cave in and surrender to that and leave
[2:01:39] off serving the one true God,
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Elohim, in all of his majesty? How do we
[2:01:47] do that? But this generation has done
[2:01:50] it.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; And you young people, and I've heard it.
[2:01:53] I've heard it many times. Well, I have
[2:01:55] friends.
[2:01:58] We have fought that devil
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; right in this church. We fought and that
[2:02:03] is a devil.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Not your friends aren't the devil. It's
[2:02:06] what you make them
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; to be. There's no sin in in them per se.
[2:02:11] There's no sin in the relationship with
[2:02:13] them per se. But it becomes sinful. It
[2:02:16] becomes a false worship and they are
[2:02:18] made a god.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; You are worshiping them and giving them
[2:02:24] obedience. And not that you turn around
[2:02:26] and say, "I don't believe in God
[2:02:28] anymore." Of course you do. There's
[2:02:29] people that are living uh living a life
[2:02:32] of debauchery. He says, "Oh, I believe
[2:02:34] in the prophet." No, no, no, no. You
[2:02:35] don't believe in the prophet.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; No, sir. You don't believe in the
[2:02:38] prophet I believe in.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Because to believe it, he said, "To
[2:02:42] believe it is to do it."
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Is this preaching all right?
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Is it all right? Is this straight down
[2:02:49] the line?
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; To believe it is to do it. Amen. That's
[2:02:53] right.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; And say, "Oh, no. I I don't deny God. I
[2:02:57] never deny the message. I never deny
[2:02:59] that." But in the meantime, all these
[2:03:01] other things, all these other pleasures,
[2:03:02] and all these other things, this is this
[2:03:04] becomes my life. I'm sorry. I have to
[2:03:06] announce to you today, you have other
[2:03:09] gods in that case. And those that may be
[2:03:11] listening as far as this thing goes, but
[2:03:13] a and and I don't want to just uh cover
[2:03:16] over and say, "Oh, how privileged we are
[2:03:17] that we don't have that anymore. We've
[2:03:19] been restored to the we have been." What
[2:03:22] what access that God has given us. I am
[2:03:24] so grateful today that the message gives
[2:03:27] us a a super sense a super conviction
[2:03:31] within us.
[2:03:44] It's what it becomes to us and the
[2:03:46] demands it makes upon us either by duty
[2:03:51] or by desire.
[2:03:57] And God spoke to the children of Israel.
[2:03:59] He told them that the consequence of
[2:04:01] this was that they would find themselves
[2:04:02] out of the land. they'd find themselves
[2:04:04] and I'll say that if we were if we are
[2:04:07] to serve
[2:04:09] all these other whether they come in the
[2:04:11] form of an opportunity they may come in
[2:04:14] the form of opportunity
[2:04:16] and I say thank God for the opportunity
[2:04:19] but the criteria is you make certain
[2:04:22] that you manage the opportunity
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; rather than the opportunity manage you.
[2:04:33] Amen.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; I believe it's good, friends. I really
[2:04:36] do believe it's good because I have It's
[2:04:39] been my experience. It's been my
[2:04:41] experience. And and and I have I
[2:04:44] wouldn't be preaching this if I didn't
[2:04:45] have some concerns.
[2:04:47] I didn't I if I didn't have some
[2:04:49] concerns. And you know, we're probably
[2:04:52] as far as time is concerned, as far as
[2:04:55] the day that we're living in is
[2:04:56] concerned, we're probably in one of the
[2:04:58] uh most upbeat times. There's more
[2:05:01] opportunities.
[2:05:02] There's more business being done. I
[2:05:05] don't know anybody that's unemployed in
[2:05:07] the church really. Anybody that's
[2:05:09] unemployed, you don't have to be there.
[2:05:11] I'm called on all the time wanting to
[2:05:13] know, is there somebody who wants work?
[2:05:14] Is there somebody who wants to work?
[2:05:16] There's all kinds of work.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; And so, there's opportunities and
[2:05:20] there's work and everything else. It's
[2:05:21] amazing that and I'm not going to get
[2:05:23] into it now, but it's amazing that
[2:05:25] Malachi deals a great deal with tithing
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; because I have found I found that this
[2:05:32] has been my own experience. Prosperous
[2:05:34] businessmen seldom tithe.
[2:05:40] But you find a little fellow that's just
[2:05:42] grinding it out and he just gets his
[2:05:45] paycheck and he's just grinding it out.
[2:05:47] You find he tithes.
[2:05:52] I talked to
[2:05:54] well quite frankly I talked to brother
[2:05:56] Dioa
[2:05:58] because I want to know I said brother
[2:06:00] Dioa you know I know that you have you
[2:06:03] know you there's men here and they deal
[2:06:05] in diamonds and and this this country is
[2:06:08] a very wealthy nation with diamonds. Are
[2:06:11] you
[2:06:13] are you do you have some heavy givers
[2:06:16] that are supporting this mighty work?
[2:06:21] Because I know a little bit about
[2:06:23] business. And I said, "This thing's
[2:06:25] humongous. This thing is takes hundreds
[2:06:29] of thousands of dollars and I know
[2:06:31] that." So I just said, "H how are you
[2:06:33] supporting this? Is there is there quite
[2:06:35] a bit of income?" And I mentioned it
[2:06:37] from the diamond industry. And he just
[2:06:39] smiled. I says, "No, no, no."
[2:06:43] I says, "You know," he let me know that
[2:06:46] that is where the giving came.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; I said, "How do you support this?"
[2:06:52] He said, "Even
[2:06:54] even the Sunday school children,
[2:06:58] they just give a little bit for a book."
[2:07:02] All the Sunday school children and were
[2:07:04] able to do a book. and just the people
[2:07:07] of the church. This is the that common
[2:07:10] people, they just they're giving and
[2:07:12] that's how it's done. But the reason why
[2:07:15] Malachi speaks about it because it was
[2:07:17] one of the big things that the people
[2:07:18] vacated
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; and we have a whole lot of young couples
[2:07:22] that are coming up in this church and I
[2:07:24] really felt it heavy heavy upon my
[2:07:26] heart. One of the first things you want
[2:07:28] to do when you get married is establish
[2:07:30] your tithing.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; And don't forget it. establish your
[2:07:35] tithing as soon as you get a job. And
[2:07:38] you see that that goes to God's work.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; We don't need it as preachers, but God's
[2:07:43] work needs it and you need it. And you
[2:07:45] need to give it more than God needs to
[2:07:48] spend it.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; You need to give it. And that's how
[2:07:50] God's work goes on. But even God finally
[2:07:53] said, God even said in the and I'm
[2:07:54] getting now ahead of myself, but God
[2:07:56] even said, "Will you rob me?" And the
[2:07:58] people had gone so far from it, they
[2:07:59] said, "Where did we where are we and
[2:08:03] have we robbed you?"
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; They didn't even know. They They had so
[2:08:08] vacated
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; and had other gods that they were busy
[2:08:12] serving.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; They said, "Well, where did we
[2:08:16] where'd we rob you?" He said, "In
[2:08:18] tithes, in offerings."
[2:08:21] If you'd have said,
[2:08:24] if God had come down and said, "I want
[2:08:26] all the robbers to stand up." All those
[2:08:28] who robbed God. They said, "Rob God? Who
[2:08:32] would ever rob God? We wouldn't rob God.
[2:08:34] I wouldn't. I love God."
[2:08:37] But they had gotten turned around in
[2:08:39] their thinking until they could not make
[2:08:42] a correct discernment.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; And so God laid it on the lines. He
[2:08:46] didn't just say, "Well, you're
[2:08:48] displacing some funds."
[2:08:51] He said, 'You stealing them.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; This is robbery.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Robbery. Who wants to be identified as
[2:08:59] robbing God? And that that really that
[2:09:02] that covers that is in two chapters
[2:09:06] of Malachi. And do you know something?
[2:09:08] I've never preached on it because
[2:09:11] I couldn't quite understand just the way
[2:09:13] it was. But when the message began to
[2:09:15] unfold to me to see how the first
[2:09:17] commandment, thou shalt have no other
[2:09:19] gods, and then I get to Malachi and then
[2:09:21] get into Matthew right after that and
[2:09:23] Jesus comes and he was saying, "You've
[2:09:25] taken the weight of your matters." And
[2:09:27] the first one was judgment.
[2:09:30] Lost the sense, lost the capacity to
[2:09:34] determine what is truly right and what
[2:09:37] is truly wrong. And listen friends, God
[2:09:41] also said, and I and and preachers get
[2:09:43] on to this, and I don't want to get on
[2:09:45] to it, and I'm just closing this moment,
[2:09:47] but people get on to it because God's
[2:09:49] word says that I'll pour on you a
[2:09:51] blessing. And so people get on the
[2:09:53] television and get on the, you know, on
[2:09:55] the radio and and after people for their
[2:09:58] their tithe doesn't belong on
[2:09:59] television. Doesn't belong on radio. It
[2:10:01] belongs where they're spiritually fed.
[2:10:04] It doesn't even belong in voice of God.
[2:10:06] It doesn't belong some other place. It
[2:10:08] belongs in the household where you are
[2:10:10] fed, where you expect to get married or
[2:10:13] your children to get married. Where you
[2:10:14] expect us to serve serve you when you
[2:10:16] come into a time of trial and you come
[2:10:18] into into hospitals and all the rest of
[2:10:20] it so that there's brothers there that
[2:10:22] can go and pray for you and have their
[2:10:24] living and and and and to maintain the
[2:10:27] the service of the church. And if we're
[2:10:29] not doing it, then you need to be
[2:10:30] somewhere else. But as long as you feel
[2:10:32] it's a place that then it needs to be
[2:10:34] supported. You can't do it for nothing.
[2:10:36] And we don't need it per se. We are not
[2:10:39] in the hole, per se. That's not the
[2:10:41] point. We want to see your life blessed.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; I had a couple come here to church. I'm
[2:10:46] with this. I'm going to close. I never
[2:10:47] expect to get on to this, but I'm going
[2:10:49] to close with it. And they came to me.
[2:10:51] They were a young couple with two
[2:10:54] children. And they came to the knowledge
[2:10:56] of the message and called us in for to
[2:10:59] have a meeting with them. And they were
[2:11:01] serious. They said, "Brother Ed, on my
[2:11:05] income here, we have it tallied down." I
[2:11:08] had it all written down and this is what
[2:11:11] I earn. And when I'm at the end, what
[2:11:14] I'm saying to you now is a absolute
[2:11:16] truth before God. He says, "And here's
[2:11:18] what we need to live." And when we get
[2:11:21] to the bottom, we are at a deficit. This
[2:11:24] is plain arithmetic. We are at a
[2:11:27] deficit. And we haven't got any tithing
[2:11:30] in there. and as believers, we know we
[2:11:33] must tithe.
[2:11:35] I said, "Yeah, that's true."
[2:11:38] So he said, "I don't know how we're
[2:11:39] going to do it. I don't know what's
[2:11:41] going to happen, but that is a
[2:11:43] responsibility before God, and we have
[2:11:46] decided we are going to tithe." They
[2:11:48] were just young believers in the
[2:11:50] message.
[2:11:52] And he came to me about 3, four months
[2:11:54] later, and he said, "Brother Ed," and he
[2:11:57] was embarrassed. He said, "You're not
[2:11:59] going to believe this." He said, "I
[2:12:01] can't explain it.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it." He said, "We're
[2:12:06] living the same lifestyle. We pay the
[2:12:08] same bills. We started tithing and at
[2:12:11] the end of the month, we got money left
[2:12:12] over."
[2:12:14] I said, "Don't try to explain it. I
[2:12:16] don't know how it happens. Just do
[2:12:18] whatever God tells you to do." He said,
[2:12:20] "I'll pour it in."
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? I'll pour it in.
[2:12:25] You can't stop God. And it may not just
[2:12:27] be money. What about health? What about
[2:12:29] fulfillment in your life? What about
[2:12:31] happiness? Hallelujah. What about
[2:12:34] justice and judgment and good
[2:12:35] discernment? What about all those
[2:12:37] things? I say, "Oh God, pour it in."
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; I don't care whatever comes in by money,
[2:12:41] but pour in the blessings of God. Pour
[2:12:44] it in upon us.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[2:12:52] Heavenly Father, you are our father. You
[2:12:56] are our instructor.
[2:12:58] You are our counselor. And oh, how we
[2:13:01] need this counsel, oh God. And I sought
[2:13:04] just to say some things, Lord, to kind
[2:13:06] of open this subject that's been so much
[2:13:08] on my heart. I pray you'll take these
[2:13:11] feeble words, Lord, and indelibly impose
[2:13:14] it and on the minds of the people,
[2:13:16] present it to them in the way that it
[2:13:18] should be, Lord. And if we've not said
[2:13:21] just exactly what's right, you'll make
[2:13:23] it right, Lord. You know that. You know
[2:13:25] my own heart, Father. How I just desire
[2:13:27] to build up the people to instruct them
[2:13:30] that the church may be a place that you
[2:13:32] will be pleased to dwell in. Oh God,
[2:13:36] have your way. Move mightily amongst us.
[2:13:39] Move in the service this evening, Lord,
[2:13:41] as our brother DJ comes to minister. Oh
[2:13:43] God, I pray that you'll use him and let
[2:13:45] him be a vessel for your service
[2:13:47] tonight, Lord. And I ask you'll give us
[2:13:49] a blessed afternoon, Father. Lord Jesus,
[2:13:53] may your name be lifted up and praised
[2:13:54] is my prayer in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:13:57] Amen.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to turn to 2036 and sing uh
[2:14:03] the song actually. Oh, How I Love Jesus.
[2:14:05] We sing the chorus quite often, but I'd
[2:14:07] like to sing the song.
[2:14:10] [Music]
[2:14:13] Is it a name you love to hear?
[2:14:20] There is a name I love to hear. I love
[2:14:28] the sing.
[2:14:32] Oh, it sounds like music
[2:14:37] in my ear. The sweetest
[2:14:42] name on earth.
[2:14:47] Oh,
[2:14:49] how I love Jesus.
[2:14:54] Oh,
[2:14:55] how I love Jesus.
[2:15:00] Oh,
[2:15:02] how I love Jesus.
[2:15:07] Because he first love me.
[2:15:13] It tells me
[2:15:16] theior
[2:15:18] love. He died to set me free.
[2:15:26] It tells me of his preious blood.
[2:15:33] The s
[2:15:35] perfectly.
[2:15:36] [Music]
[2:15:40] Oh,
[2:15:42] I love Jesus.
[2:15:47] Oh,
[2:15:48] how I love Jesus.
[2:15:53] Oh,
[2:15:55] how I love Jesus.
[2:16:01] [Music]
[2:16:04] I'd like to sing the fourth verse. I'd
[2:16:06] like the congregation to sing it.
[2:16:10] And we're going to sing this for Sister
[2:16:12] Marian, her family. It tells of one
[2:16:16] whose loving heart can feel the deepest
[2:16:19] woe.
[2:16:22] Who in each sorrow bears a part that
[2:16:26] none can bear below.
[2:16:29] We want to be a strength
[2:16:32] to Sister Marian.
[2:16:35] [Music]
[2:16:37] They need it.
[2:16:39] And we can only
[2:16:41] we can't bear what he can bear. We
[2:16:44] cannot we cannot minister the way he can
[2:16:47] minister. But we want them to know that
[2:16:49] we want to be everything that we can be
[2:16:52] for these that have suffered such a
[2:16:54] loss.
[2:16:57] You know,
[2:17:00] here's this family
[2:17:03] and they've got family in the colony.
[2:17:07] There's many here from the colonies,
[2:17:10] but I can tell you what been is just a a
[2:17:13] blazing furnace in my heart. I wish
[2:17:16] somehow that they go in there and blast
[2:17:18] the colonies to pieces.
[2:17:21] There's brothers and family, immediate
[2:17:25] family want to come out to this service,
[2:17:28] to the funeral, and they won't let them
[2:17:29] go. I said, "Who won't let them go?"
[2:17:32] said a preacher. I said, "I bless that
[2:17:34] thing to pieces.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; I tell them, I'm out of here. I'm
[2:17:37] history. I'll cast my lot with God. That
[2:17:41] thing's become an Elohim.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; That man's lifted himself up. Those
[2:17:45] things, that whole system is so corrupt.
[2:17:48] I say to all of you that came out of
[2:17:50] there, anybody can do anything. I'd even
[2:17:52] help finance you to go there and preach
[2:17:55] the gospel in the midst of them, get
[2:17:56] thrown out, stoned, cast out, or
[2:17:58] whatever you need to do. But I
[2:18:04] I see a smiling. I I I I just got
[2:18:08] something burning in me. I I thought,
[2:18:09] who can we who can we send? Who can we
[2:18:12] uh maybe brother John Stall ought to go?
[2:18:15] He He had enough fire in him for a while
[2:18:18] to burn that thing up, but we didn't
[2:18:21] send him. Maybe they maybe they need to
[2:18:22] go. It might sound What if only one came
[2:18:25] out? What if only another one came out?
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I love the I love the people
[2:18:30] that have come out of the colonies. Just
[2:18:32] platinum people. God bless them. And may
[2:18:35] there be many more if Jesus terries.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's shake that system
[2:18:40] down. And if any of them get to hear
[2:18:42] this service, I say your system's
[2:18:44] corrupted and it's not of God.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; It's of Satan because it it rules by
[2:18:51] fear and bondage
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; and takes away even the human liberties
[2:18:56] that God gave to every person. No man
[2:18:59] has been no man has come into the earth
[2:19:01] to be a slave of anything.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Andes. Nice to see
[2:19:09] you. Excuse had to have something
[2:19:11] distract me, I'd have been burning up
[2:19:13] here with this thing.
[2:19:16] You know, it's even illegal by the
[2:19:17] government. You can't hold people in
[2:19:19] this society like that. It's against the
[2:19:22] federal regulations. It's against But
[2:19:24] you know what? The government's corrupt,
[2:19:26] too.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; They cow out to it cuz it's a big
[2:19:29] industry.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; They're successful farmers and all the
[2:19:32] rest of it. I say Satan's the head of
[2:19:34] the whole thing. And God's going to
[2:19:36] destroy it. And God's going to pull out
[2:19:39] every single one. How do we know that
[2:19:41] there isn't another brother Joe Walner,
[2:19:43] Brother John Stall? How do we know
[2:19:44] they're not in there yet? And brother
[2:19:46] Jake,
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; God bless him.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Rest his soul. How we thank him. Thank
[2:19:52] God for the testimony he left here.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, we'll sing this last
[2:19:57] verse now. It tells me
[2:20:02] who
[2:20:04] heart can feel my
[2:20:09] wing
[2:20:12] [Music]
[2:20:14] sorrow
[2:20:17] a part that none can bear.
[2:20:26] Oh,
[2:20:28] how I love Jesus.
[2:20:32] [Music]
[2:20:33] Oh,
[2:20:35] how I love Jesus.
[2:20:42] How I love Jesus.
[2:20:46] Jesus.
[2:20:51] Brother Lance, would you please come and
[2:20:53] pray a prayer upon this congregation

[2:22:09] determination and with a fortitude that
[2:22:12] says, "Lord, from this day forward, God,

[2:22:18] you before my face. I will set you
[2:22:20] before my heart. And it'll be you that I
[2:22:23] serve with determination and with with

[2:22:34] have listened to the word of God.
[2:22:37] counsel, Father, right from scripture.
[2:22:40] And Lord, we know that it's the Holy
[2:22:42] Ghost that is within us that feeds only
[2:22:44] upon the word of God. And so, Lord, may
[2:22:47] that Holy Ghost receive his portion this
[2:22:50] morning. And may we leave content and
[2:22:53] happy in our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:22:55] Christ. Father, for this evening, we

[2:23:07] as we dedicate ourselves to you. And
