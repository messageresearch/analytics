[11:38] We have to ask her Derek Paris Der for
[11:41] the service in the word of prayer.
[11:45] Got a couple of testimonies.
[11:47] Sister Marjorie Miles
[11:51] [music]
[11:53] says, "I thank the Lord for his
[11:54] faithfulness. Thanks also to my pastor
[11:56] and all the ministers, deacons, brothers
[11:59] and sisters in Christ for your prayers,
[12:01] love and kindness to me. I believe the
[12:03] Lord is the great physician.
[12:06] And our brother Eddie Childers said,
[12:08] "We'd like to thank you for your
[12:10] prayers, your visits, phone calls, and
[12:12] for the love offering. [music] Words
[12:14] cannot express what this means to us.
[12:16] I've been off IV nutrition and lime free
[12:19] for 3 weeks. For 22 years, I have never
[12:22] been without an IV. that after 22 years
[12:25] of IV nutrition, [music] 16 surgeries,
[12:28] multiple hospital stays, I believe God
[12:30] has and is bringing about the
[12:32] manifestation of my healing.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; May God be given all the glory, honor,
[12:36] and praise. Amen.
[12:41] We've got requests this morning
[12:44] uh from our brother Jim Jones. And many
[12:47] remember brother Jim. Uh I've been up
[12:50] here visiting a couple of times and he's
[12:53] uh thing may be listening in on the line
[12:56] now on the internet. We just uh want to
[12:59] pray this morning for arthritis that has
[13:01] affected his sciatic nerve. [music] He's
[13:03] scheduled for surgery but knows God can
[13:06] heal him. Amen. So we want to pray for
[13:09] brother Jim this morning. There's a
[13:11] request from our sister Patty Pettingill
[13:14] that we pray for her mother who's in the
[13:16] hospital with pneumonia and uh her
[13:19] nephew Scott needs a complete heart and
[13:22] lung transplant. Um and uh her sister
[13:27] Linda who's in a nursing home with
[13:30] severe [music]
[13:31] edema in her legs. So, Sister Patty's
[13:34] requesting prayer these relatives of her
[13:36] that are very afflicted.
[13:39] Also, there's a testimony and a prayer
[13:42] request for Brotherh Vineyard. Last
[13:44] week, he fell 15 ft at work [music] and
[13:48] landed on his head and his shoulder. And
[13:50] he says, uh, breaking my collar, but we
[13:54] would like to give the Lord all the
[13:55] praise and glory for sparing my life.
[13:58] This kind of accident could have been so
[14:00] much worse. Please keep us in prayer
[14:02] because I might have to go for surgery
[14:04] to repair my soul shoulder. So, let's
[14:07] just pray for brother Bob this morning.
[14:10] God would touch him. And if you've got a
[14:13] need this morning, if you're here in our
[14:15] midst or if you're listening in, uh just
[14:18] lift your request to the Lord. Amen.
[14:20] He's aware of each and every one of our
[14:22] needs.
[14:28] Let's pray together. Heavenly Father,
[14:31] Lord, you're a mighty God.
[14:35] Lord, your grace is sufficient this
[14:37] morning,
[14:39] Lord. The needs that have been brought
[14:41] before you this morning by your
[14:42] children, Lord, have been brought in
[14:45] faith, Lord Jesus, believing that you
[14:47] had done it once, Lord, and that you
[14:49] would come once more, Father. Lord, that
[14:52] you would meet the requests of our
[14:54] brother Jones. Father, Lord, Sister
[14:57] Patty, Father, and Faith has written
[14:59] down the request, Lord, for loved ones,
[15:02] Lord. Lord, there might be those that
[15:05] have a organ that's out of place.
[15:08] Father, would you come and provide the
[15:11] strength, Lord, needed in the body to
[15:14] bring that back to its rightful
[15:16] position, Lord? [music] Lord, this
[15:18] morning for this service, Father, we're
[15:21] looking to the unseen this morning,
[15:23] Lord, as Abraham looked beyond the
[15:25] promise, Lord. He could not contain it
[15:29] in that hour which he stood, Lord, but
[15:31] you gave him a promise, Lord, and he
[15:33] held on to that promise.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're looking this morning to your
[15:38] word, Father God, that you would speak
[15:41] to each and every heart that's been
[15:43] gathered here this morning. Lord, may we
[15:45] cry out, Father, if there be a need in
[15:48] our lives, Lord, the hands have been
[15:50] raised.
[15:53] Come and meet every need, Lord Jesus, in
[15:56] divine presence. Those on the internet,
[15:58] Lord, on the telephone hookup, Lord, may
[16:01] be in a wayward state, Father, but Lord,
[16:04] looking for a touch of Jehovah to come
[16:07] upon their lives, Lord, would you do
[16:09] your eternal work this morning, Lord
[16:11] Jesus? [music]
[16:13] Father, drive out the fear in our lives,
[16:16] Lord. Take out every unclean spirit,
[16:19] Lord, that would hinder your children,
[16:21] Lord, from receiving from your throne of
[16:23] grace.
[16:25] Lord, we're desiring to hear from you.
[16:28] Lord, take our pastor, Lord, may as the
[16:31] vessel has prepared, Lord, and as he
[16:33] stands behind this sacred desk, Father,
[16:36] may you speak divinely to each and every
[16:38] heart, Lord, for you know the needs that
[16:41] we have need of. You know the walk that
[16:44] we have, Lord, and where we should be.
[16:46] Father, if we're not where we ought to
[16:48] be, Lord, would you bring us higher?
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe we could just worship
[16:55] you for a moment.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, how lovely you are.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; How wonderful your grace is, Lord Jesus,
[17:02] in our lives, Lord. Give us a liberty,
[17:05] Father, to praise you and to worship
[17:07] you, Lord Jesus. Lord, may there be such
[17:10] a sweet atmosphere here this morning,
[17:12] Lord, that you would feel comfortable,
[17:14] Lord, to come down and just walk amongst
[17:17] us this morning, as you did with Adam
[17:19] and Eve in the cool of the evening,
[17:21] Lord, walking hand in hand with your
[17:24] children, Lord. Come and minister to our
[17:27] hearts, oh God. Take us beyond this
[17:30] realm of the flesh, Lord, and let us
[17:32] look into that realm of eternity,
[17:34] Father.
[17:35] draw us closer unto thee. We ask it,
[17:38] Father, in the precious name of our Lord
[17:41] Jesus Christ.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[17:49] You may be seated.

[27:24] I am so glad that Jesus loves me.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; [music]
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we're going to be dedicating
[27:41] uh another little one. And we all were
[27:44] this size once.
[27:47] You don't remember it, but it was an
[27:49] important time for the parents, your
[27:52] parents. I I'm certain of that. in this
[27:55] important time for brother Chris and
[27:57] sister Brenda
[27:59] bring their little one here. Uh looks
[28:03] like she's been well fed, well looked
[28:06] after.
[28:08] We want to uh dedicate.
[28:13] She has a different name. I couldn't
[28:14] find that name anywhere. It must have
[28:16] been
[28:17] right from South Africa. Lizel,
[28:20] &gt;&gt; I say leisel. Leisel. All right.
[28:23] And uh I'm forgiven because I couldn't
[28:27] find it anywhere.
[28:29] She she won't run into it elsewhere. I
[28:32] don't think Leisel
[28:34] Rebecca
[28:36] and Leisel because I wanted to find out.
[28:38] You know, lots of times parents tell me
[28:39] what the name means, but I like to
[28:41] confirm what it is. And and I had to
[28:43] take uh Brother Chris and Sister
[28:46] Brenda's word. It's consecrated to God.
[28:50] And her second name Rebecca, servant of
[28:52] God.
[28:54] And I took those
[28:57] which means consecrated is the same in
[28:59] the scripture is dedicated.
[29:02] And to dedicate actually has direct
[29:04] reference to that which is renewed or
[29:07] new.
[29:09] And I thought of Lisel as a she's a as
[29:15] far as physically is concerned
[29:17] she's a new creature in humanity but not
[29:20] a new creature in Christ yet. She hasn't
[29:22] had that experience of course but there
[29:25] is uh something I thought was very very
[29:28] outstanding
[29:30] and I'll just tell you what it is to
[29:32] consecrate which is something that's new
[29:36] in respects to her form.
[29:38] She's new.
[29:40] God is so great. There'll never be
[29:42] another one like her.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; There's only one. The fingerprints on
[29:49] her 10 little fingers are all different
[29:52] from all six billion of humanity.
[29:56] She is, the scripture says in in
[29:58] dedicate. She's unique.
[30:01] She's new. She's fresh.
[30:04] She's uncommon. Not common. uncommon,
[30:08] completely different. Isn't it marvelous
[30:11] how our God has made each one? And then
[30:16] in respect to her kind, this is
[30:19] unprecedented and novel
[30:22] and different. You know, it's it's
[30:24] marvelous when we think how unique they
[30:26] are. Now, we have children that are just
[30:28] born and some are unwanted and some are
[30:31] sent off to homes and so on so forth.
[30:34] But I'm so thankful that Leisel has been
[30:37] born into a home of a dedicated mother
[30:40] and father. And that's important. It's
[30:44] hard for me to dedicate a child if I
[30:47] don't know that the parents are
[30:48] dedicated. I was here the other night
[30:52] and brother Chris is working up
[30:54] preparing the new video edit studio. And
[30:57] when you see people give themselves and
[30:59] they haven't spent days but have spent
[31:02] hours and weeks and months up there,
[31:06] that is the best example for a child.
[31:08] And this is what brother Brandham has
[31:10] said.
[31:12] You've no doubt heard this before, but
[31:14] he said, "Your life
[31:16] will impress your children
[31:19] and influence your children by the
[31:22] example that you set before them." And I
[31:26] think it's a good thing that we put
[31:28] every effort
[31:30] before our children as godly parents and
[31:33] make an example and be an example. If
[31:36] you ever run into a a difficult time
[31:39] with this child, both of you want to be
[31:42] able to look up and said, "Father, we
[31:44] did everything. We knew what to do. We
[31:47] took her to the house of God. She was
[31:50] under the influence of the gospel. She
[31:52] felt the presence of God. She saw people
[31:55] moved. She saw people healed. She saw
[31:57] the supernatural. And we did everything.
[32:00] And now your messenger prophet said to
[32:03] us that if we would be this example that
[32:05] would influence her. And I believe in
[32:08] that. I believe in that. I believe it's
[32:10] very hard for parents to have been
[32:14] slothful in their spiritual life and
[32:16] have not lived a dedicated life and then
[32:19] run into a a time when they really need
[32:22] to call on God and say, "How do you have
[32:24] confidence? How do you have confidence
[32:27] to pray?" But when you do this and you
[32:30] live that example and the Bible tells us
[32:35] about this influence and brother Bram
[32:37] spoke about it and that is
[32:41] that is the inflow. There's something
[32:43] from each of you that is going to flow
[32:46] into her. An inflow that will modify her
[32:50] life that doesn't bother me. I raise
[32:53] some.
[32:55] Amen.
[32:56] I'm going to dedicate Leisel
[33:00] Rebecca.
[33:03] Amen.
[33:09] Let's pray. Father, this is such a
[33:12] privilege for me to hold this child
[33:15] in front of her mother and father. A gem
[33:19] that you have given, a spirit that came
[33:22] from God. And Father, I pray that with
[33:25] the heritage that she has, her
[33:27] grandparents that are here, Lord,
[33:29] Brother Paul and Sister Linda, and uh
[33:33] Lord Jesus, I think of her
[33:35] greatgrandparents, our brother Billy and
[33:37] Sister Betty Ratif, Father, and and
[33:40] Sister Brenda's parents that are here,
[33:42] our brother Tim and sister Susan. What a
[33:44] heritage she has. But it goes far beyond
[33:47] the human lineage, but into eternity.
[33:50] And I pray Lord that as I hold her, you
[33:54] will receive her as they have received
[33:56] her from you, as she is dedicated now in
[34:00] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I
[34:03] pray, Lord, that you will take and watch
[34:05] over Leisel. I pray that you will keep
[34:08] her in good health. I ask that her heart
[34:11] will respond quickly
[34:13] &gt;&gt; when she hears the name of Jesus Christ
[34:15] and the Holy Spirit will hover over her
[34:18] and teach her the way of life. And Lord,
[34:22] and on that day that the circle will not
[34:24] be unbroken. But when we gathered that
[34:27] great marriage supper, let her walk down
[34:30] as that beautiful young lady that you
[34:33] have pictured in your mind. And may she,
[34:36] oh God, find the place where she has
[34:39] been ordained to sit and be there with
[34:41] her loved ones. Father, this is why I
[34:44] dedicate her to you now in the name of
[34:46] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[34:49] Amen.
[34:50] Hallelujah. Praise God. I can start
[34:53] preaching right now.
[34:57] God bless you, Chris. God bless you,
[34:59] Sister Brenda.
[35:01] We're going to have another song.
[35:06] We're going to have another song.
[35:07] Brother Rod is going to just come now
[35:10] just before we turn to the word. So
[35:12] happy you're all here. Isn't it
[35:15] wonderful?
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God. This song I believe Sister
[35:20] Margaret is going to sing. Is that
[35:21] correct?
[35:23] And I'd like you to hear the words
[35:25] especially because it's so much in
[35:27] keeping with the messages we've been
[35:30] speaking in the last three weeks or so.
[35:32] And we'll continue on today, the Lord
[35:34] willing. Brother Rod,
[35:37] Sister Margaret, why don't you come? And
[35:39] while she's coming, let's sing together.
[35:40] We are standing on holy ground.
[35:46] We [music]
[35:47] are standing [singing]
[35:52] on holy [music] ground.
[35:59] And I know [music]
[36:02] that there are angels
[36:06] all around.
[36:08] [music]
[36:10] Let us praise. Let us praise [music]
[36:15] [singing]
[36:17] Jesus.
[36:19] Now
[36:21] [music]
[36:23] we are standing
[36:26] in [music]
[36:27] his presence. Glory.
[36:34] [music]
[37:09] Why have we
[37:13] [music] been distressed? [singing]
[37:18] Oh, we've
[37:20] been [music] troubled.
[37:22] So,
[37:26] what is it [music]
[37:29] that we've done?
[37:34] Have we transgressed [music] his
[37:37] [singing]
[37:37] laws?
[37:40] Let us search [singing]
[37:44] and [music] test our ways.
[37:49] and see where [singing]
[37:51] we've drunk.
[37:55] Let's forsake
[37:58] our own ways
[38:04] and he will make [music] us strong.
[38:09] Though he had cast out, but he will lift
[38:15] [music] up.
[38:17] Though he have broken, yet he will bind.
[38:22] [music]
[38:24] He hath wounded,
[38:27] but he will heal.
[38:31] With his [music] people, his covenant
[38:35] he'll keep.
[38:53] Let us search
[38:56] and [music] test our ways
[39:01] and see where [singing]
[39:03] we've drawn. [music]
[39:07] Let us lift
[39:10] our hands in praise
[39:15] and [music] worship him who's our God.
[39:20] For he had cast [music] down, but he
[39:25] will lift up. [music] Though he had
[39:29] broken, yet he will bind.
[39:35] He hath wounded, but he will heal
[39:42] with his people. [music]
[39:44] His covenant he'll keep.
[39:48] [music] For he had cast down, but he
[39:52] will lift up. [music]
[39:55] Though he had broken, yet he will bind.
[40:00] [music]
[40:02] He had wounded, but he will heal
[40:09] with his people. His [music] covenant
[40:13] he'll keep
[40:16] with his people. [music]
[40:18] His covenant he'll keep
[40:22] with his [music] people. His covenant
[40:26] he'll keep
[40:30] with his people. His covenant [music]
[40:34] he'll keep.
[40:44] With his people, his covenant will keep.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Hey, just hold on to those words while
[40:51] we soon will be going to the word. Uh, I
[40:54] need to just make a couple of
[40:56] announcements.
[40:59] Uh,
[41:01] we met with the deacons this last
[41:03] weekend, the trustees, and I want I want
[41:05] to say to the congregation,
[41:08] you have a just a wonderful group of
[41:10] men. It was just so blessed after all of
[41:14] these years, years, and years. and and
[41:17] their concern with the people and for
[41:20] the church and for the gospel of Jesus
[41:22] Christ and just to think that you know
[41:24] we can meet and discuss so many things
[41:27] and concerns and yet it's just a blessed
[41:31] time of unity and to see the brothers
[41:33] enjoy one another. They have
[41:37] uh are requesting
[41:39] and so I'm making it because I believe
[41:41] that you will uh abide by by this
[41:47] because of our problem of of parking
[41:49] space and space everywhere. Uh we've had
[41:54] some of you have double parked and park
[41:57] along the side here and we cannot get in
[42:01] emergency vehicles if they're needed. Uh
[42:05] a fire truck or a rescue uh truck or an
[42:09] ambulance can't get to the door and they
[42:13] can't get move around. they can't get
[42:15] around in the parking lot. So, I'm going
[42:17] to request that you don't double park on
[42:20] the ends where they're uh just in the
[42:24] parking spaces and they're arranging now
[42:26] to have the areas striped and painted.
[42:31] So, you will not park in those areas.
[42:33] They will have to have the vehicles
[42:35] moved. Uh last Sunday we needed to get
[42:38] emergency vehicle in and uh one of the
[42:41] deacons was going all over through the
[42:43] church trying to find the people who
[42:45] were double parked and so we would
[42:48] request that you would not double park
[42:50] and I know that it's a problem you're
[42:52] parking on the street and up the street
[42:54] here and that will be our next thing we
[42:56] need to pray about to see if God will
[42:58] help us to maybe get a little bit more
[43:01] space than we have right now. the
[43:05] church, just so you know, as a
[43:07] congregation, the church purchased, uh,
[43:10] the house beyond brother Alex and Sister
[43:13] Walkinas,
[43:15] uh, it came up for sale. And I
[43:17] understand, I didn't find out till
[43:18] yesterday that one of the brothers in
[43:20] the church was kind of looking at it to
[43:22] he wanted to be near the church, so he
[43:24] was wanting to make an offer on it. And
[43:26] we didn't know that it was up for sale
[43:27] for quite a while. And anyway, we had
[43:30] purchased that property. It is u uh we
[43:34] thought that it was a good thing to do
[43:36] because it gives us if for per chance we
[43:39] had to try to make a little more room
[43:42] here. Uh the city wouldn't allow us to
[43:45] do anything, we didn't have enough
[43:46] parking space and that was our our big
[43:50] problem before. This would add a little
[43:52] piece of ground. Now we have two extra
[43:53] lots and the houses on them. But uh
[43:57] we're just looking to the Lord to see
[43:58] how God would guide us. We don't know
[44:00] what the future holds. This is a young
[44:03] congregation and if you sat down and and
[44:06] did the some of the, you know, some of
[44:09] the brief calculations that the brothers
[44:12] have done and the trustees have done,
[44:14] you'll find that uh I mean, we're we're
[44:16] dedicating babies. We dedicated one
[44:19] today. We've got one. We got two backed
[44:21] up and you know, they're just coming
[44:23] down the the line. And uh but it's a
[44:27] young congregation and you think we've
[44:30] been here now over 15 years. I think
[44:32] it'll be 15 years in January.
[44:35] And uh when you you think 5 years goes
[44:38] by just like that. I appreciate some of
[44:41] the brothers that I've been speaking to,
[44:42] fathers who got just young children, but
[44:45] they're already thinking terms of the
[44:47] school. They want to be able to get
[44:48] their children in the school. They would
[44:50] like to have it in at least the seven
[44:52] years. And we've got over 20 children
[44:56] that are coming right downstream
[44:59] that would want to go into the school.
[45:02] We don't we can't put them in the
[45:03] school. We have absolutely no room to
[45:06] put them in the school. With the extra
[45:08] space, we might be able to get another
[45:10] portable or two, but the feeling of the
[45:12] trustees is that it would be just an
[45:14] expensive band-aid and it really
[45:17] wouldn't do a whole lot for us. So, we
[45:20] may have to be looking for uh seriously
[45:22] for another location. And you say,
[45:25] "Well, we've got I got a little space
[45:27] beside me this morning." I tell you, we
[45:29] had the Lord's table foot washing and
[45:31] then the people coming in for that. We
[45:33] couldn't hardly move in here. And you
[45:35] sisters and the brothers just couldn't
[45:38] hardly move. And and just the
[45:40] congregation itself just through its
[45:42] natural
[45:43] uh increase is is just uh very very
[45:46] substantial. So you would you make that
[45:49] a special matter of prayer, please.
[45:51] Everything that we are engaged in is
[45:53] really quite
[45:55] uh where we're really cramped for space
[45:57] right now. And we just opened up in
[46:00] here. The brothers have been working
[46:02] there for several months. And I'll just
[46:05] tell you that was a major task. It
[46:07] wasn't just we had to get new
[46:08] engineering from the city of Suriri and
[46:12] they required that we actually replace
[46:15] the roof structures and the joist, the
[46:19] floor joist and have them as engineered
[46:22] beams. Every joist had to be an
[46:24] engineered beam. And the brothers are
[46:26] brother Gordy Russell. I want to on
[46:29] behalf of the congregation say thank you
[46:31] brother Gordy. He just assumed such a
[46:33] tremendous responsibility. and Michael
[46:36] Ray, brother Michael Ray, Brother Chris
[46:40] Merittz, and many other brothers. But
[46:42] these brothers have taken a incredible
[46:45] amount of work. If you saw the wires
[46:48] that Brother Chris Meritz along with uh
[46:50] Brother Michael strung trays of wires
[46:55] because they have to wire in for the
[46:57] equipment room for all the video work
[46:59] and the translators will be up there
[47:02] area I think for about four translators.
[47:04] We've added about 700 square ft, but it
[47:07] was a mammoth mammoth task. And that's
[47:10] what we call an expensive band-aid. Uh
[47:13] when it's finished, we're going to make
[47:15] it possible so all the congregation be
[47:17] free to, you know, go up there and see
[47:19] it and and visit the brothers. I have a
[47:23] incidentally, Brother Tony and Sister
[47:25] Rebecca are in Iran right now. I have a
[47:28] picture of them. Could uh can we show
[47:31] that picture?
[47:40] Brother Tony even has a bit of a beard.
[47:42] He I don't know. They might They fit in,
[47:45] don't they?
[47:48] He said, "Uh,
[47:51] we're having a nice time. Things are
[47:53] very different. We have met some nice
[47:56] friends and uh couldn't say much more."
[48:01] That's all he said. having a nice time.
[48:04] We've met some good friends and so on.
[48:06] They they just came to Iran from Kuwait.
[48:09] They were in Kuwait and then they'll be
[48:10] making their way home. So, I'm sure
[48:12] you'll hear much more when we get here.
[48:14] Would you remember to pray for them,
[48:16] please?
[48:18] All right. Would you stand? And I'd like
[48:21] to have you turn in 1 Coronicles,
[48:23] please, to uh the 16th chapter.
[48:28] Nice to see our brother Brad Johnson. I
[48:31] know that he was welcomed officially,
[48:32] but I tell you what, we've we have a
[48:36] longstanding friendship
[48:39] there. Brother Brad and his wife, Sister
[48:41] Molly. Sister Molly didn't come with
[48:43] you, Brother Brad. All right. Well,
[48:46] we'll forgive you. I guess
[48:48] you greet her for us.
[48:51] In the 16th chapter of Chronicles, we're
[48:54] going to read
[48:56] [cough and clears throat]
[48:57] starting with verse 11.
[49:02] Seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his
[49:05] face continually.
[49:08] Remember his marvelous works that he
[49:10] hath done. His wondrous his wonders and
[49:13] the judgments of his mouth. Oh ye seed
[49:16] of Israel, his servant, ye children of
[49:18] Jacob, his chosen ones. He is the Lord
[49:22] our God. His judgments are in all the
[49:24] earth. Be mindful always of his
[49:27] covenant, the word which he commanded to
[49:30] a thousand generations,
[49:33] even of the covenant which he made with
[49:36] Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac, and
[49:40] hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a
[49:42] law, and to Israel for an everlasting
[49:45] covenant, saying, Unto thee will I give
[49:48] the land of Canaan the lot of your
[49:51] inheritance, when ye were but few, even
[49:54] a few,
[49:55] and strangers in it. And when they went
[49:58] from nation to nation, and from one
[50:01] kingdom to another people, he suffered
[50:04] no man to do them wrong. Yay, he
[50:07] reproved kings for their sakes, saying,
[50:10] "Touch not mine anointed, and do my
[50:12] prophets no harm. Sing unto the Lord,
[50:16] all the earth, and show forth from day
[50:18] to day his salvation. Declare his glory
[50:22] among the heathen, his marvelous works
[50:25] among all nations. For great is the Lord
[50:29] and greatly to be praised. He also is to
[50:33] be feared above all gods.
[50:37] And I am reading also from John the 10th
[50:41] chapter
[50:45] vers 30 and 31.
[51:08] Perhaps I'll just back up and read verse
[51:11] 27.
[51:13] My sheep hear my voice and I know them
[51:16] and they follow me and I give unto them
[51:19] eternal life and they shall never
[51:23] perish.
[51:24] Neither shall any man pluck them out of
[51:26] my hand. How's that for a covenant?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; My father which gave them me is greater
[51:32] than all and no man is able to pluck
[51:36] them out of my father's hand.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; I and my father are one.
[51:42] Then the Jews took up stones again to
[51:46] stone him. Amazing, isn't it? Let's ask
[51:50] the Lord to give us a special
[51:53] understanding of this scripture.
[51:56] Almighty God, giver of every good gift.
[52:00] You're the father of lights. All light
[52:02] comes from you. I pray that you'll
[52:05] banish any darkness or cloud, any fog
[52:10] that may be upon our minds. Give us
[52:13] clarity of the Holy Spirit, clarity of
[52:17] understanding, clarity of speech this
[52:20] morning. I pray God, I pray you'll give
[52:23] understanding to the people. May the
[52:26] Holy Spirit be upon us. Lord, we do not
[52:29] want to lean upon the arm of flesh or
[52:33] upon the arm of just human ability.
[52:37] Lord, we have nothing to do with that.
[52:38] We want to deny that just now for we
[52:42] declare we are dependent upon you.
[52:44] Entirely dependent. Move upon us, oh
[52:48] God. Have your free course in the
[52:51] service, Lord. Have your free course, I
[52:54] pray. And Lord Jesus, we are interested
[52:57] that your name will be glorified and
[52:59] lifted up. The name that's above every
[53:01] name, those that might be needy here,
[53:04] yet we have prayed, Lord. But we are
[53:07] continuously in need, Lord. And we have
[53:09] some even this morning that have special
[53:11] needs. I pray that you'll reach out and
[53:14] meet that need, oh God. Touch them with
[53:17] a divine touch. And may their faith rise
[53:21] beyond the emotions or rise beyond just
[53:25] the natural mental powers. May their
[53:28] faith rise oh God in that sixth sense
[53:31] that dimension Lord that is beyond this
[53:34] natural elements and lay hold of the
[53:37] promise of God the covenant which you've
[53:39] made in Jesus Christ's name. We're so
[53:42] dependent upon you now. We pray that you
[53:44] will grace this entire day in the
[53:46] service tonight. And our brother Lance
[53:48] will minister, oh God. I pray that you
[53:51] will grace this entire day with your
[53:53] presence. And we will declare without
[53:56] shame, we love you, oh God. We love you
[53:59] with all of our heart for what you've
[54:01] done for us and what you are doing. In
[54:04] Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[54:07] Amen. You may be seated.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Now the scripture which I just closed
[54:21] with,
[54:22] Jesus said, "I and my father are one and
[54:26] then the Jews took up stones to stone
[54:30] him." You need to put those two things
[54:33] together. It's amazing. Jesus said many
[54:36] things and of course they took up stones
[54:38] at other times, too. But you need to ask
[54:42] yourself the question, why was it at
[54:44] this moment? Uh, and what was there in
[54:48] this statement that caused this kind of
[54:51] response from the hearers, the people?
[54:55] They were the religious people. They
[54:58] were god-fearing people in their minds.
[55:02] And then they took up stones to stone
[55:05] him. Now the declaration that he made
[55:11] that could not have come at any other
[55:13] time. In other words, when you hear the
[55:16] hear the word then took they up stones
[55:19] to stone him. Then it was at that moment
[55:23] they took up stones because that was the
[55:25] only time Jesus couldn't say that when
[55:29] he was 12 years old even though he was
[55:33] the son of God but the there was a a
[55:36] time when those things could be said.
[55:38] And I want to I want to just take
[55:40] another scripture if you don't mind. Uh
[55:43] if you want to turn to it you can turn
[55:44] to it in Luke's gospel
[55:47] the 4th chapter. And I'd like to just
[55:49] take my time this morning. Uh I believe
[55:52] that I get encouraged by you that I
[55:54] should do that.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Luke the 4th chapter verse 20.
[56:01] And he closed the book
[56:05] and gave it again to the minister
[56:08] and sat down and the eyes of all of them
[56:12] that were in the synagogue were fastened
[56:14] on him. Now let me just have your
[56:16] attention for a moment. The scripture
[56:18] here earlier says, "And he went to the
[56:21] synagogue." He he went to the synagogue
[56:25] as was his custom.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; In other words, this was not the first
[56:29] time he was doing it. He as was his
[56:32] custom. But now on this occasion, it was
[56:37] different. He that was his custom, he
[56:40] always went to the synagogue. See, that
[56:42] was his custom. A custom is something
[56:45] you do again and again and again. It's a
[56:48] part of your life. And now, but on this
[56:51] occasion
[56:52] as was his custom. But now, there came a
[56:55] different time, a different moment in
[56:58] time. And the book of Isaiah was
[57:01] delivered to him. And the scroll, we
[57:04] have it in the book, but he has it in
[57:05] the scroll. But he's going through the
[57:08] scroll to find the place. and he's
[57:11] looking for the place and he finds it.
[57:14] The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[57:17] because he hath anointed me to preach
[57:20] good tidings unto the meek. He has sent
[57:23] me to bind up the brokenhearted, to
[57:25] proclaim liberty to the captives and the
[57:29] opening of the prison to them that are
[57:31] bound. And he only reads half of the
[57:33] next two sentences, only one sentence of
[57:35] it. He splits the verse right in half.
[57:38] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[57:40] Lord. The last part of that same
[57:42] sentence is and the day of vengeance of
[57:46] our God to comfort all that mourn. But
[57:49] he didn't come to proclaim the day of
[57:52] vengeance of our God at that time. So
[57:54] when he finished reading to proclaim the
[57:57] acceptable year of the Lord which is
[58:00] just a comma he stopped and he closed
[58:03] the book the Bible says AND SAID THIS
[58:07] DAY IS THIS scripture fulfilled in your
[58:11] ears. Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Had he gone on, he wouldn't have been
[58:15] able to say that. But he stopped at
[58:18] precisely. My point is he could only
[58:21] say, "I and my father are one." It came
[58:25] at a precise moment in time when that
[58:28] had to be introduced. That had to be
[58:30] spoken. And it also had to generate that
[58:34] KIND OF A RESPONSE. THEN TOOK the
[58:37] upstones to stone him.
[58:44] in and the seed is not air with the
[58:46] shock. In that message,
[58:49] prophet of God
[58:52] says, "Now it's hard to get in a church
[58:55] for a sponsorship." Now he's talking
[58:57] about this age, this time. Now it's
[59:00] hard. Can you imagine?
[59:04] Isn't this remarkable?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Now
[59:08] here here's a here's a messenger.
[59:10] Brother Brandham in his ministry
[59:13] couldn't beat the people off
[59:16] lined up filling any auditorium filling
[59:20] it to the tens of thousands and overseas
[59:25] and Durban and Johannesburg and Bombay
[59:27] and on and on and hundreds of thousands
[59:30] of people. Now he's saying
[59:34] it's hard to get a church for
[59:36] sponsorship.
[59:38] When they were crying, come and join us.
[59:40] Come and BE WITH US. JUST ADJUST your
[59:42] doctrine a little bit. Two or three
[59:44] small changes. You won't have any
[59:46] problem. You won't have any problem. And
[59:48] he keeps referring to he he's referred
[59:50] to a number of times. And Jesus when he
[59:53] was the young prophet and doing all of
[59:55] the miracles and things, everybody
[59:56] wanted this young prophet. Everybody
[59:58] wanted this this popular move that was
[1:00:01] happening because it was at a level.
[1:00:03] They wanted they wanted the miracles.
[1:00:05] They wanted the signs. They wanted the
[1:00:07] wanders that were taking place. They
[1:00:10] just uh that they knew that that would
[1:00:11] be good for their organization.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Hard to get sponsorship just as it was
[1:00:19] with our Lord Jesus
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; because it's him. If it he said if it
[1:00:25] isn't it isn't me it's him it's not me
[1:00:29] he's saying but as he preached at the
[1:00:32] first and healed the sick and raised the
[1:00:36] dead you have to get the picture now
[1:00:38] brother Brandham's reaching right back
[1:00:39] into the scripture in the time of Jesus
[1:00:41] and taking a quantum leap from there to
[1:00:44] this day and making that absolute
[1:00:47] perfect comparison because it was the
[1:00:49] son of man in a body in this day and it
[1:00:52] was the son of man being revealed in
[1:00:54] this day. And that's why he's saying,
[1:00:56] "It's not me. It's him.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; It's still him. It's not me that can't
[1:01:02] get sponsorship. It's him that can't get
[1:01:04] sponsorship."
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't that perfect?
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; And back here, there was a time when
[1:01:10] everybody wanted him. Oh, this young
[1:01:13] prophet. And the and and the Pharisee
[1:01:15] wanted him for his feast day to have a
[1:01:18] feast that he would have this popular
[1:01:20] young prophet there even though he
[1:01:22] didn't believe his doctrine but he
[1:01:24] wanted that young prophet Jesus Christ
[1:01:26] of Nazareth to come and that was him and
[1:01:29] his revealing back then in a physical
[1:01:31] revealing and the physical body because
[1:01:33] the body had to go to Calvary but this
[1:01:35] time it's the same Christ only in word
[1:01:38] form and not one iota different. Amen.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; It's hard thing even to get a group of
[1:01:46] people like this to really comprehend.
[1:01:48] It's the same Jesus Christ. Not one
[1:01:52] trace different. Not one trace less in
[1:01:55] power. Not one. If you can reach through
[1:01:57] today and touch the hem of his garment,
[1:01:59] it will be as effective as it was back
[1:02:01] then.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; His power is present. His presence is
[1:02:06] here to make himself known to you. And
[1:02:08] he wants to do it more than we even want
[1:02:10] to receive it. Amen.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Let us not be part of the multitude that
[1:02:16] just stood by the wayside and watched
[1:02:18] him and mused mused mentally about him
[1:02:23] and wondered about him and questioned
[1:02:25] about him. But let us let us be I hope I
[1:02:28] can get you persuaded today to release
[1:02:31] all the elements of the natural life and
[1:02:35] reach through even beyond your
[1:02:37] environment here in the congregation
[1:02:39] today to reach beyond it and actually
[1:02:41] touch him who is here who is present.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:47] It's not me.
[1:02:49] But he was but as he preached at the
[1:02:53] first at the first and healed the sick
[1:02:57] and raised the dead and cleansed the
[1:03:00] lepers and cast out devils. Everybody
[1:03:05] wanted him.
[1:03:07] But there come a time
[1:03:09] where there's a message that always
[1:03:12] follows the sign. A message always
[1:03:15] follows the sign because the sign has a
[1:03:19] voice. And he said if the sign doesn't
[1:03:21] have a voice, no matter what you hear
[1:03:22] about, I hear, "Oh, great things are
[1:03:24] taking place." That is that's fine. I
[1:03:27] don't deny great things. I don't deny
[1:03:29] that people even have uh things that I
[1:03:32] can't explain or supernatural events
[1:03:34] that are taking place. But you just sit
[1:03:37] back. Don't get carried away with that.
[1:03:39] You watch and see if there's a voice
[1:03:41] that follows that sign. If there's a
[1:03:44] message and that message will have to
[1:03:46] agree with this 100%.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; A message that follows that sign
[1:03:54] he because a sign has a voice. He says
[1:03:57] but when he sat down one day when he sat
[1:04:02] down one day and said now brother
[1:04:06] Brandham has brought a perfect parallel
[1:04:08] between that day and this day Christ
[1:04:10] then and Christ now. It wasn't Christ
[1:04:13] then and his ministry now. It was Christ
[1:04:16] then and the ministry of Christ now.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; The very ministry you've been called
[1:04:21] under.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; The very voice that moved you.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And now he is saying he's saying but
[1:04:29] when he sat down one day and said
[1:04:33] I and my father are one. You would have
[1:04:37] thought that that would have inspired
[1:04:40] and brought a response out of the people
[1:04:42] that said, "Oh,
[1:04:44] OH, HOW GLORIOUS. THIS ONE WHO WE HAVE
[1:04:48] BEEN FOLLOWING. THIS ONE WHO WE HAVE so
[1:04:52] uh uh so been uh gripped and taken by
[1:04:56] this early ministry. Now he's saying
[1:04:59] different things. He's saying new
[1:05:00] things. He's saying I and my father are
[1:05:03] one." You would have thought they would
[1:05:04] have said, "Isn't this marvelous that
[1:05:07] God has raised up one who has been
[1:05:09] vindicated and proven amongst us and is
[1:05:12] now able to declare that he that has
[1:05:16] that God is his father." That was new.
[1:05:19] Moses didn't say that. You know, Elijah
[1:05:22] didn't say that. Samuel didn't say that.
[1:05:24] God God had never been declared by the
[1:05:27] people of the Old Testament to be their
[1:05:30] father.
[1:05:33] They never said, "I'm his son." And that
[1:05:37] is why they took up stones to stone him.
[1:05:40] But today, it's a common we're his
[1:05:43] children. We're sons and we're
[1:05:45] daughters. And it's a common thing for
[1:05:47] us. But you understand this was a this
[1:05:49] was a a remarkable thing to to and and a
[1:05:52] blasphemy as far as the Jewish people
[1:05:55] were concerned to make that kind of a
[1:05:57] declaration. But when he sat down one
[1:05:59] day and said, "My father and I are one."
[1:06:03] That was more
[1:06:05] than they could stand.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; That was more than they could stand that
[1:06:11] they could take. It was also when he
[1:06:13] said, "Except you eat my flesh and drink
[1:06:15] my blood, you have no life in you."
[1:06:19] He says,
[1:06:22] "What doctor and well-thinking people
[1:06:25] would have said, "This man's a human
[1:06:28] vampire trying to get you to eat his
[1:06:31] flesh and drink his blood." He never
[1:06:32] explained it. He just said it.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; And there's things today that have been
[1:06:37] spoken even in the message and people
[1:06:39] maybe wrestle with it one way or
[1:06:41] another. We're not to wrestle with it.
[1:06:44] It's been spoken. We just leave it
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; and believe it. And then he went on to
[1:06:49] say, "And tonight you might hear things
[1:06:52] that through the meeting that's just
[1:06:55] said, we might not be able to explain,
[1:06:58] but remember Jesus is the same. Jesus
[1:07:01] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:07:04] forever." WHAT'S HE SAYING? IT'S A
[1:07:06] COMMON PHRASE. Jesus Christ is the same
[1:07:08] yesterday, today, and forever. In other
[1:07:10] words, he said it back there. They
[1:07:13] didn't understand it. He'll say it here,
[1:07:15] and they won't understand it. He said it
[1:07:17] there and he didn't explain it. He'll
[1:07:19] say it again and he won't explain it.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; He'll say he said it back then. He
[1:07:24] expected the people to believe it.
[1:07:26] People just like you sitting maybe not
[1:07:28] on seats such as you are, but sitting on
[1:07:30] the banks listening to him. He said it
[1:07:33] back there. He expected they'd believe
[1:07:35] it. He says it today. He expects that
[1:07:37] we'll believe it. When they believed it
[1:07:39] back there, they received the
[1:07:41] supernatural. When we receive it today,
[1:07:43] we'll receive the supernatural when we
[1:07:45] believe. Hallelujah.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; I see you raise your hand, brother Mike
[1:07:51] Vineyard. God bless you.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; May God answer your prayer. Touch your
[1:07:57] body and your son.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Bob, we prayed for him fell 15
[1:08:05] or 18 feet.
[1:08:08] We need the supernatural, friends. And
[1:08:11] this God that we're talking about, this
[1:08:14] God, he so yearns and so desires that
[1:08:18] when today when we hear the same words
[1:08:21] that we will at least have this uh not
[1:08:24] just a concept but a revelation that it
[1:08:26] is the same Jesus Christ. Oh, I can't
[1:08:30] stress that enough because if we if that
[1:08:32] if we can absorb that, there's just
[1:08:35] absolutely nothing that is impossible
[1:08:38] with God. You believe that? Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; With man this is impossible, BUT WITH
[1:08:43] GOD NOTHING,
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; NOTHING. Say the word, nothing shall be
[1:08:49] impossible.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; So the very ministry that called you
[1:08:57] at this time was sent at this particular
[1:09:01] season
[1:09:03] to make the two one.
[1:09:06] That's what this ministry is all about.
[1:09:08] And I've alluded to that and I've made
[1:09:10] certain statements as we've gone along,
[1:09:12] but I have felt that I wanted to
[1:09:14] approach this subject once more. And
[1:09:17] some of the statements may be repeated,
[1:09:20] but I believe it's it's it's essential
[1:09:23] in the message proving his word. And
[1:09:25] incidentally, I was sitting in that
[1:09:26] service.
[1:09:30] Brother Brandham goes into the vision
[1:09:32] which I was included in. And if you read
[1:09:35] the read the message, I was the young
[1:09:38] man in the green checkered shirt. Most
[1:09:41] of you know that.
[1:09:43] Maybe visitors here don't know that I
[1:09:45] was in that vision. That vision took six
[1:09:48] hours, minimum of six hours to be
[1:09:51] fulfilled from the beginning to the end.
[1:09:55] You know, brother Bram talks about going
[1:09:56] in to pray for a boy or something, pray
[1:09:58] for someone. And he said, "If in the
[1:10:01] vision there's a hat on the bed and he
[1:10:04] goes in and the hat's not there, he
[1:10:06] can't go and put it there."
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; In the vision, I was wearing a green
[1:10:11] checkered shirt.
[1:10:14] I that I'd had that shirt for years. It
[1:10:16] was a green checkered dokin shirt and it
[1:10:20] had got ripped here a lot of times and
[1:10:22] my wife just stitched it up with a
[1:10:23] sewing machine, stitched it up several
[1:10:25] times. I don't know why it tore there,
[1:10:26] but it was torn there.
[1:10:29] And so when I was getting ready to go on
[1:10:31] this particular hunt, I said to her,
[1:10:34] "Throw this shirt away and go and get me
[1:10:37] a new shirt." And I thought red would be
[1:10:40] a good color. When I lived in the north,
[1:10:41] I never got red, but now we're going up
[1:10:43] in the mountains. I thought maybe I
[1:10:45] should be have red shirt so they can see
[1:10:46] me long ways off.
[1:10:49] And being the good wife that she is, she
[1:10:53] didn't do it.
[1:10:57] I have to say that. I mean, she had the
[1:11:00] she was Sarah. She gave the right
[1:11:01] instruction this time.
[1:11:04] She was in the vision, I guess. So, she
[1:11:07] didn't do it. She just swed it up again.
[1:11:10] As it needs to be, we all got up in the
[1:11:13] of of the morning. I didn't know there
[1:11:15] was any special thing to happen. And we
[1:11:18] get up in the morning and make our way.
[1:11:20] And I we had to cross a creek. Now, I
[1:11:23] don't remember that cuz I fell in so
[1:11:25] many times, I guess. But brother
[1:11:27] Brandham remembered it real well and I
[1:11:29] think we were crossing on a log or
[1:11:31] something and I fell off that log and
[1:11:33] fell into the water of this creek.
[1:11:36] I scold incidentally
[1:11:39] and I had I so I just said to the
[1:11:40] brothers just wait and I'll run back to
[1:11:42] the camp cuz we weren't that far. I'll
[1:11:44] run back and change and change my
[1:11:47] clothes. And so I ran back, opened up my
[1:11:50] duffel bag and was going to get into a
[1:11:52] nice new shirt and looked at open up my
[1:11:54] duffel bag and here's this old green
[1:11:56] checkered shirt. I thought she didn't
[1:11:59] get me a new shirt.
[1:12:02] So I put on that shirt and now I'm right
[1:12:05] on my way to fulfill a vision.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; See, I didn't have any idea there was
[1:12:11] any vision coming on. I didn't have a
[1:12:14] least clue that 6 hours from now or 6 or
[1:12:17] 7 hours from now I was going to be
[1:12:20] standing by the trail as I was supposed
[1:12:22] to be in the vision. Uh that there was
[1:12:24] an 18-year-old young fellow that was
[1:12:26] beside me with not much hair on his
[1:12:28] hands and was going to spread out his
[1:12:31] hands for some reason or was going to
[1:12:33] hear a voice that's 42 inches. I mean I
[1:12:36] didn't know any none of that was
[1:12:38] planned. You understand? It just
[1:12:40] happens. But it happened right at that
[1:12:42] season and everything had to come
[1:12:44] together. It was absolutely made to
[1:12:47] measure. It is. Why? Because it's thus
[1:12:50] sayeth the Lord and it's an eternal
[1:12:53] word. And that's why I can speak with
[1:12:55] such confidence today. And when you read
[1:12:57] proving his word, it is one of the
[1:13:00] marvelous most marvelous descriptions he
[1:13:02] gives of the son of man ministry which
[1:13:05] was his ministry at this time. Now
[1:13:08] friends, why did it come at this time?
[1:13:10] Do you know why? God knew you were going
[1:13:14] to be here at this time. And he knew
[1:13:17] that there was something a part of the
[1:13:20] contract was in you by a predestinated
[1:13:23] seed that was in you. You were going to
[1:13:26] be born AND BROUGHT INTO THIS LIFE. YOU
[1:13:29] WERE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING IN YOU THAT
[1:13:31] WAS NOT GOING TO MATCH ANY DENOMINATION.
[1:13:35] IT WOULDN'T MATCH ANY CLUB. IT WOULDN'T
[1:13:37] MATCH ANY SOCIETY. IN FACT, IS IT
[1:13:40] WOULDN'T MATCH EVEN WITHIN THE NATION
[1:13:42] THAT YOU WERE RAISED UP IN. YOU WOULD GO
[1:13:45] AROUND SAYING LIKE THE LIKE THE LITTLE
[1:13:47] eagle in the barnyard, "SOMETHING'S
[1:13:49] WRONG. I'm eating, BUT IT DOESN'T
[1:13:51] SATISFY. THIS ISN'T MY DIET FOR SOME
[1:13:54] REASON. I hear these other voices all
[1:13:57] around me, but it doesn't make any SENSE
[1:13:59] TO ME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS CLOCK
[1:14:01] CLUCK of this uh of this so-called
[1:14:04] mother that I have. I don't understand
[1:14:06] it. And then one day you HEARD A CERTAIN
[1:14:09] SCREAM. You heard A CERTAIN SOUND. WHAT
[1:14:11] WAS IT? It was the voice BEHIND THE
[1:14:14] MESSAGE, BEHIND THE SIGN. YOU HEARD THE
[1:14:17] SOUND. AND YOU JUST SAID, "OH MY, THAT
[1:14:20] SOUNDS GOOD TO ME." In fact is it
[1:14:23] sounded so good, we said in our mind,
[1:14:25] "It can't be real. IT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
[1:14:28] That's too good." But it was precisely
[1:14:31] God's voice coming to you. It was the
[1:14:33] other part of the contract that was
[1:14:35] coming to meet to meet the the half that
[1:14:38] you had
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; last last Wednesday. I took the contract
[1:14:43] and I tore the covenant in two. And
[1:14:46] there was a and when I read half of it,
[1:14:48] you that were here, most of you were
[1:14:50] when I read half of it, it didn't make
[1:14:52] any sense. But when you put the two
[1:14:54] together in that day, Hallelujah. I'll
[1:14:58] write my law in their hearts.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:03] Isn't that marvelous?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; And listen what he says in here. Now he
[1:15:07] goes back not to even to the time of
[1:15:10] Jesus but into the time of Abraham
[1:15:13] who had been promised. And incidentally,
[1:15:15] I hope maybe I can get time to get back
[1:15:17] into that covenant that God made with
[1:15:19] Abraham. But God had already made a
[1:15:21] covenant with Abraham. Then in Genesis
[1:15:23] 18, he visits him in the form of Elohim,
[1:15:28] in the form of a man,
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; and he eats he eats meat and drinks milk
[1:15:34] and there's butter and whatever more
[1:15:37] that Abraham set before him. He made a
[1:15:40] feast for him. And I'll just put it the
[1:15:43] way uh the prophet of God has said it.
[1:15:45] And remember, he said that was not Jesus
[1:15:49] talking to Abraham there. He says that
[1:15:53] could discern the thoughts of Sarah's
[1:15:56] mind behind him. That was not Jesus.
[1:16:00] He said he had not yet been born. You
[1:16:03] understand? He's making a distinction
[1:16:05] here. But it was a man in human flesh.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; And that Abraham called Elohim. He
[1:16:12] called him Lord Elohim. the great
[1:16:16] almighty and Jesus said as it was in the
[1:16:20] days of Sodom. Now he said watch close.
[1:16:23] And I'll ask this congregation today,
[1:16:25] watch close.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; This may be the dividing line between
[1:16:28] some of you that believe and some may be
[1:16:31] a question. Maybe some can't believe,
[1:16:33] but I'll say you believe it.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; I admonish you to believe it.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; If I came to the end of my life
[1:16:43] tomorrow, I'd want to know that I
[1:16:45] believed it.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Even if I hadn't understood it, believe
[1:16:48] it.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Even if your mind reasons and you have
[1:16:52] difficulty, but believe it and ask God
[1:16:54] to help you believe it even more than
[1:16:56] you may have before you came to the
[1:16:58] meeting. And Jesus said, "As it was in
[1:17:01] the days of Sodom, now watch close. in
[1:17:04] the days of Sodom. So it will be at the
[1:17:07] coming of the Son of Man. It will be the
[1:17:10] same when the Son of Man is being
[1:17:13] revealed. When he's being revealed, not
[1:17:17] no more as a church. Not no more. He
[1:17:20] said, "The bride's called. In that day,
[1:17:23] the Son of Man will be revealed." Notice
[1:17:26] how what he's stressing. He said, now he
[1:17:28] asked the question, "What the Son of Man
[1:17:31] is being revealed?" There's a certain
[1:17:34] season in time when the conditions of
[1:17:37] Sodom and Gomorrah are everywhere and
[1:17:39] the days of Noah have repeated
[1:17:42] themselves globally when that season
[1:17:45] arrives.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; And it has arrived.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S SAYING IN THAT day
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; that's why I started out today saying
[1:17:55] when Jesus said I and my father are one
[1:17:58] then they took up stones to stone him.
[1:18:01] couldn't happen earlier, but now the
[1:18:03] time had arrived. And he went into the
[1:18:05] synagogue as was his custom. And he
[1:18:08] stood up for to read. It's the only time
[1:18:11] it's quoted in his entire life that he
[1:18:13] stood up in the synagogue to read. And a
[1:18:15] priest handed him the scroll. And he
[1:18:18] opened up the book. And you know, the
[1:18:20] same thing repeated in this time.
[1:18:22] Brother Brandham stood up for to read
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; in birth painans. and he opened the book
[1:18:28] and couldn't open the pages were stuck
[1:18:30] TOGETHER AND HE THOUGHT THERE HAD BEEN A
[1:18:33] MISPRINT AND THE BIBLE had just been
[1:18:34] given to him by his wife and a priest
[1:18:37] stood up. Priest Bishop Stanley stood up
[1:18:40] and came beside him and handed him his
[1:18:43] Bible
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; and he and he and he and he he read the
[1:18:46] scripture out of the priest's Bible. The
[1:18:49] same repeat, the same thing happening.
[1:18:52] Oh my, there's so many things. Are you
[1:18:54] able to follow me?
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; And the same thing is repeating when you
[1:19:00] see these conditions globally. Then he
[1:19:02] said it will be that day. Now I know
[1:19:04] this may be elementary to a lot of
[1:19:05] people but a lot of it needs to be said
[1:19:07] again needs to be referred to again. And
[1:19:10] perhaps you've heard it many times and
[1:19:12] it'll just clinch. It'll come with a
[1:19:15] whole new force to you. And in that day
[1:19:18] the son of man will be revealed. And he
[1:19:21] says what? In other words, what for?
[1:19:24] He answers it to join the church to the
[1:19:29] head.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; What is it? IT'S THE CATALYST.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; HE'S SAYING the catalyst
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; THAT UH THAT ELEMENT
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; HAS now arrived.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; THAT SPECIAL THING THAT GOD SENT THAT
[1:19:45] WILL UNITE THE TWO TOGETHER,
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; THE HEAD AND THE BODY.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:53] AND IF IT CAME AT THAT SEASON, THAT
[1:19:55] MEANS THAT IT WASN'T CONNECTED WITH THAT
[1:19:57] KIND OF A UNION BEFORE.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; It was moving up to it, but it hadn't
[1:20:03] come to that place to join the church to
[1:20:06] the head, unite the marriage of the
[1:20:10] bride.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Then he goes on, continues on, the
[1:20:13] bridegroom,
[1:20:15] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:20:19] through this. Amen.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Some of you are here this morning and
[1:20:26] maybe you've been moved say, "Oh, I was
[1:20:29] moved by
[1:20:31] a time when brother Lance preached and
[1:20:33] it moved me. Brother John Andy's
[1:20:35] preached, Brother Tony, Brother Tom,
[1:20:37] Brother Ernie or Brother Bisll,
[1:20:41] you preached and I was so affected and
[1:20:45] my understanding was open. THE HOLY
[1:20:47] SPIRIT CAME ON ME. I WAS DELIVERED."
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HAPPENED. But
[1:20:51] I will tell you, it was none of those
[1:20:53] brothers. It was the bridegroom call. I
[1:20:56] WAS LISTENING TO A TAPE. I HEARD A
[1:20:58] PROPHET PREACH. OH, I HAD HEARD IT MANY
[1:21:00] TIMES. BUT NOW IT CAME WITH A NEW FORCE.
[1:21:03] IT WASN'T WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT WAS THE
[1:21:04] BRIDEGROOM CALL.
[1:21:07] And it could only come in this season.
[1:21:09] But I am here declaring over the last
[1:21:12] three services and now number four. THIS
[1:21:15] PARTICULAR ELEMENT could not be at any
[1:21:18] other time in the history of mankind. It
[1:21:22] had TO COME AT THIS HOUR FOR ONE PURPOSE
[1:21:26] TO UNITE.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE FORCE TO UNITE. IT'S A
[1:21:33] CATALYST THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO UNITE
[1:21:36] THE ELEMENTS TOGETHER into one. And once
[1:21:39] that element which is the Holy Spirit
[1:21:42] has bonded the two together, it is
[1:21:45] inseparable.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to God. There's no way to
[1:21:50] part it.
[1:21:54] I have had an experience
[1:21:57] you know
[1:21:59] when you break especially some China
[1:22:02] that's one thing that why China becomes
[1:22:05] valuable is kind of because China breaks
[1:22:09] China chips you know loses its value
[1:22:12] some of its value you can find some very
[1:22:15] very valuable pieces you know from
[1:22:18] Dresden and Germany they make beautiful
[1:22:21] china And uh in uh in England they've
[1:22:26] just made beautiful China in France.
[1:22:29] Made some beautiful China. But the
[1:22:31] reason why China becomes real valuable
[1:22:33] is because it breaks over the over the
[1:22:37] years and it's gone from history
[1:22:41] disappears
[1:22:42] and there's always less and less of it.
[1:22:44] It's a depleting
[1:22:48] uh uh a depleting commodity.
[1:22:53] So you always try and I've had the
[1:22:55] experience I I go to a store and say
[1:22:58] have you got something
[1:23:00] that will put these two together
[1:23:03] and that is one of the hardest things to
[1:23:05] get. I have had experience I've gone and
[1:23:08] talked to people say I need to glue two
[1:23:10] things together or they've come up with
[1:23:13] new products. They said you put this in
[1:23:16] there that thing will break but it won't
[1:23:18] break right here. won't break on this
[1:23:21] same this will glue this thing together
[1:23:24] and it makes the two so strong. This
[1:23:27] weld is so strong. This substance is so
[1:23:30] strong. But you have a tube of this and
[1:23:32] you have a tube of this. This is one
[1:23:34] substance but this is a catalyst. You've
[1:23:37] got to have this and you mix them
[1:23:38] together and I tell you what, you don't
[1:23:41] have much time. Once that catalyst gets
[1:23:45] in there, you don't have much time. I
[1:23:47] tell you what, in this hour, we don't
[1:23:49] have a whole lot of time. It's all just
[1:23:51] come converging, crashing in at the one
[1:23:54] moment in time. And this is this is the
[1:23:57] moment where the cattle has come.
[1:23:59] Hallelujah.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; And he said this, the bridegroom call
[1:24:03] will come right through this when the
[1:24:05] son of man will come down and come in
[1:24:08] human flesh.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; That was what was operating. But you
[1:24:12] hear you hear it on the tape. You can
[1:24:14] see it on the on that brief video. And
[1:24:17] incidentally, I [clears throat] saw two
[1:24:19] men that are very much given over to the
[1:24:22] first part of the ministry. There's a
[1:24:23] video and I think that's the one that
[1:24:25] was shown over the uh the television in
[1:24:28] in Israel.
[1:24:30] And uh because they had they had William
[1:24:32] Brandom up there and they had AA Allen
[1:24:35] and they had Jack Cole, the three of
[1:24:37] them, and they had a little clip from
[1:24:39] each of their ministries. They had AA
[1:24:42] Allen casting out a demon of cancer and
[1:24:45] they had Jack Cole praying for another
[1:24:47] woman. Brother Bram talks about Jack
[1:24:49] Cole. He talks about AA Allen didn't one
[1:24:52] moment deny the mighty works that were
[1:24:55] happen. We wouldn't belittle them at
[1:24:57] all. Have no comment on it whatsoever.
[1:25:00] God does what he does and he allows what
[1:25:03] he allows. But the thing is he says if
[1:25:05] that sign doesn't have a voice coming
[1:25:08] behind it. Oh, I'm glad that we're not
[1:25:11] just left and say, "Well, I saw a man
[1:25:13] cast out a devil or I saw a man pray for
[1:25:16] somebody and they were healed." I can't
[1:25:18] explain how they were healed. That's not
[1:25:19] up to us to explain. But when we say, "I
[1:25:22] saw some marvelous things." That's fine.
[1:25:25] But I would sooner hear someone say, "I
[1:25:27] heard a voice."
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; AND IT MADE THIS BOOK LIVE.
[1:25:35] AND THERE WERE THINGS I COULDN'T GRASP,
[1:25:38] THINGS I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND. AND MY
[1:25:40] MIND WAS FILLED WITH DARKNESS and
[1:25:42] confusion. And how I yearned, how I
[1:25:46] yearned for light and life.
[1:25:48] And then one day I heard a sound. One
[1:25:52] day I heard a voice AND JUST ONE WORD
[1:25:54] AND IT CLEARED IT ALL AWAY. LISTEN, I
[1:25:57] heard four I heard four scriptures
[1:26:00] brought to me out of the prophet's
[1:26:01] mouth. And in those four scriptures,
[1:26:03] I've used the term a thousand questions
[1:26:06] evaporated out of my mind. I mean, I
[1:26:10] lived for years in in in a uh not in a
[1:26:15] confusion as such, but I I was confused
[1:26:17] about where did this brother stand,
[1:26:19] where did that man, where did this
[1:26:21] minister stand? And I saw their lives
[1:26:23] and I saw their anointing and
[1:26:27] heard them speak in tongues and all
[1:26:29] kinds of miraculous things and
[1:26:31] declarations.
[1:26:32] But one day, and this one believed one
[1:26:35] thing, that one believed another thing.
[1:26:37] of that. How can this be young man
[1:26:39] looking looking for something solid,
[1:26:42] looking for something that would uh you
[1:26:44] know answer these questions and sit now
[1:26:48] with another man, a prophet of God, and
[1:26:52] reach into the same scripture. All four
[1:26:55] verses that he referred me to, I knew
[1:26:58] them well. And he even left a line a a
[1:27:02] word out. In the last days seth God I'll
[1:27:05] pour my spirit upon. I said all. He said
[1:27:08] right. A ll all flesh. But not all flesh
[1:27:12] is saved.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; A drunk can feel the spirit of God. A
[1:27:16] prostitute could feel the spirit of God.
[1:27:18] It doesn't mean anything unless she
[1:27:20] believes it
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; OR HE BELIEVES IT for the transformation
[1:27:24] of the soul. The word has to reach the
[1:27:26] soul. I hope it's getting down to you
[1:27:28] friends.
[1:27:30] And he says, "And he'll come in human
[1:27:31] flesh."
[1:27:33] He'll come in human flesh. Just thank
[1:27:35] God through all OF THESE CENTURIES.
[1:27:37] HASN'T DONE IT, FRIENDS,
[1:27:39] children of 2004.
[1:27:42] He didn't do it
[1:27:44] a 100 years ago. He did IT IN YOUR DAY.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; HE DID IT IN YOUR SEASON. AMEN.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; GOD THE BRIDEGROOM IN NOW another
[1:27:57] capacity IN A BRIDEGROOM CAPACITY
[1:28:00] OPERATING THROUGH A HUMAN VESSEL.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS WHY? TO UNITE
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; THE TWO TOGETHER.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:17] AMEN.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Then
[1:28:21] then back there they took up stones to
[1:28:24] stone them.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; But back then there were a lot that
[1:28:28] didn't take up stones to stone them.
[1:28:31] They just sat
[1:28:33] and listened.
[1:28:36] That's nice.
[1:28:38] There's a marvelous, marvelous things he
[1:28:41] sang. Don't be in that crowd either.
[1:28:50] Don't be in that crowd.
[1:28:53] Well, that's nice.
[1:28:57] This man Jesus, he has got some real
[1:28:59] energetic people. He's got Peter. Oh my
[1:29:01] goodness, Peter. He just gets all
[1:29:03] enthused. I heard great things about
[1:29:05] Peter. Stepped out on the water and did
[1:29:07] all of these things. And he's got he's
[1:29:10] got James, a prayer warrior, and John.
[1:29:15] Oh, and and then there's all these
[1:29:17] others. And there's, you know, they're
[1:29:19] following him some women.
[1:29:25] He's got some enthused ministers today,
[1:29:27] too,
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; who've been gripped. I tell you what,
[1:29:32] I don't preach
[1:29:34] the way I'm preaching at my age here
[1:29:37] today because
[1:29:40] I want a certain kind of friendship or
[1:29:43] certain kind of association or certain
[1:29:45] kind of name or a certain kind of
[1:29:47] living. That's not it. I tell you what,
[1:29:50] in just a second, if I could get free of
[1:29:52] it, I would. But I am compelled as long
[1:29:55] as I have breath, as long as I have
[1:29:58] energy, as long as I have competence of
[1:30:00] mind and a mental retention AND ABILITY
[1:30:04] TO STIR UP THE GIFT THAT'S IN THE
[1:30:06] PEOPLE. CAUSE THEM TO BELIEVE. PERSUADE
[1:30:09] THEM TO BELIEVE. PERSUADE THEM TO AGREE
[1:30:12] WITH THIS WORD OF GOD. WHY DID THIS
[1:30:15] COME? WHY WAS HE REVEALED TO ME? TO
[1:30:17] UNITE ME AND MAKE ME ONE.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; NOT TWO, BUT ONE.
[1:30:23] HALLELUJAH. SHIELDED
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; BY THE spirit of God,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; by this prophet catalyst.
[1:30:31] Hallelujah.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; To make the two one to unite the two
[1:30:36] together, the church has to be the word.
[1:30:39] He is the word and the two unites
[1:30:42] together. And to do that,
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; TO DO THAT, it will take
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WILL TAKE THE MANIFESTATION OF
[1:30:50] THE REVEALING of the SON OF MAN. SEE HOW
[1:30:53] HE GOES OVER IT AND GOES OVER IT AND
[1:30:55] GOES OVER IT. NOW, in the little bit
[1:30:56] that I read you, he's come to that very
[1:30:59] POINT THREE TIMES in this paragraph.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; And I would say to you that is a very
[1:31:04] very significant thing.
[1:31:08] You know
[1:31:12] it's
[1:31:14] he said see I'll come back to my thought
[1:31:18] it's this it's son of man Jesus Christ
[1:31:22] will come down now he I'm not repeating
[1:31:24] it he's repeating it I'm going on in the
[1:31:27] same paragraph now we're coming to the
[1:31:28] fourth time it's the son of man Jesus
[1:31:32] Christ will come down in human flesh
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; among us.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; And will make the word so real.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Make it so real
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; that it'll unite the church and him AS
[1:31:51] ONE, the bride, AND THEN SHE'LL GO HOME
[1:31:55] TO THE WEDDING SUPPER. I WILL SAY
[1:31:57] WITHOUT THAT UNITING, IT WILL BE NO
[1:32:00] GOING HOME TO THE WEDDING SUPPER.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; This is not some option. THIS ISN'T AN
[1:32:06] OPTION. SAY, "WELL, that's nice. I
[1:32:09] think, you know, it'd be nice if I COULD
[1:32:11] BELIEVE LIKE THAT." YOU NEED TO BELIEVE
[1:32:13] like that. YOU NEED TO SAY, "OH, GOD,
[1:32:15] MOVE ALL THE OBSTACLES OUT OF THE WAY.
[1:32:17] MOVE all the hindrances out of the way.
[1:32:20] MOVE EVERYTHING, EVERY QUESTION OUT OF
[1:32:22] MY MIND, or if I haven't even received
[1:32:24] it to this level yet, let me COME TO
[1:32:26] THAT DEGREE WHERE I CAN MAKE THAT uh I
[1:32:29] can make that discernment." It was God,
[1:32:32] the bridegroom, IN HUMAN FLESH,
[1:32:34] OPERATING THROUGH A VESSEL. AND THAT
[1:32:37] ELEMENT HAD TO COME TO MAKE THE WORD SO
[1:32:39] REAL THAT I COULD NOT DENY IT. AND I
[1:32:42] HEARD IT. IT WASN'T MERELY ANOINTED, BUT
[1:32:44] it was the word of God. It was anointed
[1:32:46] to me. And it was so real.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Now I hear
[1:32:53] from a minister's mouth. The purpose was
[1:32:57] to take and unite me, make me one unit.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; My guarantee
[1:33:07] I'll sit at the wedding supper.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Then she'll go home to the wedding
[1:33:15] supper. He said, "Amen. She's already
[1:33:18] united."
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; And we go to the wedding supper, not to
[1:33:22] the marriage. She's already united.
[1:33:25] She's already united. In my message
[1:33:28] today, I'm saying it could not happen a
[1:33:31] 100 years ago.
[1:33:33] Your
[1:33:36] forefathers
[1:33:37] may have been wonderful people. And I'll
[1:33:39] tell you, there's great people that have
[1:33:40] lived in the past. They didn't have this
[1:33:43] privilege. They looked for it. They
[1:33:46] looked for it. They could see it in the
[1:33:48] word of God. They looked for it, but it
[1:33:51] didn't come.
[1:33:53] Now,
[1:33:56] I'd like you to notice the ministry of
[1:33:58] Elijah. The Elijah spirit that was
[1:34:00] anointed that anointed John the Baptist.
[1:34:04] At the birth of John, his father,
[1:34:06] Zachcharias,
[1:34:08] was filled, the Bible says, with the
[1:34:10] Holy Ghost. He's filled with the Holy
[1:34:13] Ghost. And he prophesied saying uh
[1:34:16] concerning the ministry of John and this
[1:34:19] is what he said. And his father
[1:34:21] Zachcharias was filled with the Holy
[1:34:23] Ghost and prophesied saying, "Blessed be
[1:34:26] the Lord God of Israel, for he hath
[1:34:29] visited and redeemed his people. He hath
[1:34:32] raised up a horn of salvation for us in
[1:34:36] the house of his servant David, as he
[1:34:39] spake by the mouth of his holy prophets,
[1:34:42] which which have been since the world
[1:34:44] began, that we should be saved from our
[1:34:47] enemies, and from the hand of all that
[1:34:50] hate us, to perform the mercy promised
[1:34:55] to our fathers, and to remember his holy
[1:34:59] covenant. This was the ministry of the
[1:35:02] spirit of Elijah to remember or bring
[1:35:06] back to remembrance or to restore to the
[1:35:09] people their to their consciousness the
[1:35:12] covenant which God made.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; A covenant's often made up of
[1:35:20] many promises, not just one, but many
[1:35:23] promises. And then there can be a whole
[1:35:25] series of promises. And then God
[1:35:28] declared as he did to Abraham. And I
[1:35:31] brought it Wednesday night. He declared
[1:35:33] to Abraham. He said,
[1:35:36] "I'm going to give you a son
[1:35:40] and your seed is going to inherit this
[1:35:41] land." And he went on and made a number
[1:35:44] of promises.
[1:35:46] And then at the end of the experience of
[1:35:50] dividing the animals and so on, he said,
[1:35:53] "And this was the covenant that he made.
[1:35:56] This is my covenant between you." Now,
[1:35:58] the covenant involved all the promises
[1:36:00] that he made to him.
[1:36:02] The word covenant, it's a it's a pledge.
[1:36:07] It's an agreement. And God made an
[1:36:09] unconditional covenant that went all the
[1:36:13] way back to Eden when he prophesied of
[1:36:15] the coming of Jesus Christ and that he
[1:36:17] would bruise the serpent's head.
[1:36:23] He speaks of that and the quote I made
[1:36:25] here
[1:36:27] after Adam and Eve sinned and God said
[1:36:32] depart out of my presence. He couldn't
[1:36:34] stand it. So I can see Adam starting to
[1:36:38] walk away.
[1:36:40] Then he said, I could hear those sheep
[1:36:43] skins, bloody sheep skins
[1:36:47] flopping against his legs. He's going
[1:36:49] out. And I can see God who covers all
[1:36:52] space and time.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Who has no beginning or ending. I can
[1:36:57] see it all bottling down like a funnel
[1:36:59] coming down like this for one little
[1:37:02] four-letter word. L O V E. love.
[1:37:07] Actually, before I spoke that on
[1:37:10] Wednesday, before I referred to this, I
[1:37:11] woke I wasn't even awake yet in the wee
[1:37:14] hours of the morning, sometime in the
[1:37:16] middle of the night, I guess.
[1:37:20] And I I I just had an experience that I
[1:37:22] was speaking this to you
[1:37:25] and I I I saw myself raising my hands
[1:37:27] and just bringing it down. I said in
[1:37:29] into one funnel, just a funnel. We were
[1:37:33] we were command We were separated from
[1:37:36] God. But now this God just came down
[1:37:40] into a funnel.
[1:37:43] L O V E. Love.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:37:49] how grateful I am to God that he did not
[1:37:52] leave us separated and cast off.
[1:37:59] You know friends,
[1:38:02] and I hope you take this correct. I
[1:38:04] travel a lot. I travel more than perhaps
[1:38:07] I want to travel and more than you want
[1:38:09] me to travel.
[1:38:12] But it has been my sad experience and
[1:38:14] those others of the ministers of this
[1:38:16] church that have traveled.
[1:38:19] And this is when I'm done saying what
[1:38:21] I'm going to say.
[1:38:24] I want to
[1:38:26] preface that by saying this that it is
[1:38:31] that is the reason we're so compelled to
[1:38:35] try to hue to the line.
[1:38:38] Try to live
[1:38:41] according to the word of God.
[1:38:44] Because as I have traveled been in a lot
[1:38:47] of churches and I don't know why and I
[1:38:49] see and observe in the people
[1:38:52] that
[1:38:54] the life of this word they're missing
[1:38:58] they're missing the preciousness of it.
[1:39:01] They're missing the strength of it and
[1:39:05] they're unsettled in their lives. And
[1:39:08] you see you see distress and you see
[1:39:10] questions and and what brings such an
[1:39:13] agony a agony to me I say they've got
[1:39:16] access to it.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; It is right here before them. Why are
[1:39:20] they living so far below their standard?
[1:39:23] Why isn't the man of God declaring the
[1:39:26] full strength of the word? Why isn't he
[1:39:28] telling them this son of man that has
[1:39:31] been manifested to you HAS COME IN A
[1:39:34] SPECIAL WAY to make THE WORD SO REAL?
[1:39:39] THAT IT WILL COMPEL YOU, IT WILL DRAW
[1:39:41] YOU, IT WILL ACCELERATE,
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; THE ONENESS, THE UNITY, THE COMING
[1:39:47] TOGETHER.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; And then you see people, you see them
[1:39:52] last year, you see them five years ago
[1:39:55] and they're walking,
[1:39:57] walking with this reality, with this
[1:40:00] faith. They're walking in the light of
[1:40:02] the word. AND GOOD TIMES COME, BAD TIMES
[1:40:05] COME, ALL KINDS OF THINGS COME. BUT YOU
[1:40:07] SEE THEM YEARS LATER AND THEY'RE THE
[1:40:08] SAME AND YEARS LATER AND THEY'RE THE
[1:40:11] SAME. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'LL TELL YOU
[1:40:13] WHAT IT IS. IT'S NOT THEM. IT'S NOT
[1:40:14] THEIR GOOD LIFE. IT'S NOT THEIR
[1:40:16] STRENGTH. IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S THE SEAL
[1:40:18] THAT'S HOLDING.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S THAT THAT'S BEEN MADE REAL TO THEM
[1:40:25] THAT'S HOLDING.
[1:40:27] and where where that uh uh uh substance
[1:40:31] which is the revelation of the of the
[1:40:34] son OF MAN OF JESUS CHRIST. I TELL you
[1:40:37] what, once the disciples were filled
[1:40:40] with the Holy Spirit, YOU KNOW, BEFORE
[1:40:42] BEFORE PENTECOST,
[1:40:44] THEY TOOK UP STONES TO STONE JESUS. BUT
[1:40:47] THE DISCIPLES WERE STANDING THERE, THEY
[1:40:48] DIDN'T TAKE UP stones to stone them.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; They didn't WANT TO CAST THEM IN PRISON.
[1:40:56] THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CRUCIFY THEM BECAUSE
[1:40:59] THE THE ONENESS HADN'T come yet.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; BUT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST IN ACTS 2,
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WHEN THE TIME OF PENTECOST HAD
[1:41:12] FULLY COME,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; IT COULDN'T HAPPEN 30 YEARS BEFORE THAT,
[1:41:16] BUT AT THAT TIME AND WHEN THE DAY OF
[1:41:19] PENTECOST WAS FULLY COME, THERE CAME A
[1:41:21] SOUND FROM HEAVEN AS A RUSHING MIGHTY
[1:41:25] WIND. HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE RIGHT PLACE. It was
[1:41:29] Jerusalem. IT WAS THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO
[1:41:32] HAD BELIEVED his word. THEY COULDN'T
[1:41:34] UNDERSTAND IT, BUT THEY BELIEVED IT. OH,
[1:41:37] FRIENDS, ARE YOU HEARING ME? THOSE
[1:41:39] PEOPLE HAD TO BE BORN. THEY HAD TO LIVE.
[1:41:41] AND THERE WAS WOMEN and men THAT WERE IN
[1:41:44] THAT GROUP. THEY HAD TO BE THERE.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ORDAINED OF GOD TO BE THERE.
[1:41:49] AND A RUSHING MIGHTY SOUND FROM HEAVEN
[1:41:52] CAME. AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE, THE
[1:41:54] PROPHET SAID, DIVIDED ITSELF UP. THE
[1:41:57] WORD OF GOD DIVIDED ITSELF UP. AND THERE
[1:42:00] WAS ON EACH OF THEM licks of fire,
[1:42:03] CLOVEN TONGUES OF FIRE. AND BROTHER
[1:42:04] BANNER MAKES A POWERFUL STATEMENT. HE
[1:42:07] SAID, GOD, HE HAD DIVIDED HIMSELF. UH HE
[1:42:10] HAD HE HAD DIVIDED HIMSELF. THE PILLAR
[1:42:12] OF FIRE NOW WAS MANY LITTLE FLAMES. AND
[1:42:14] HE AND HE MAKES A COMMENT. THIS isn't
[1:42:16] verbatim NOW, BUT HE SAID WHAT WAS HE
[1:42:18] DOING? HE WAS he was bringing himself
[1:42:21] together.
[1:42:24] THAT HAD TO HAPPEN BECAUSE PART OF THE
[1:42:27] WORD WAS IN you and in you and in you
[1:42:30] and in you and in you and in you. AND SO
[1:42:33] THE PILLAR OF FIRE DIVIDED ITSELF
[1:42:35] TOGETHER AND IDENTIFIED THAT EACH OF
[1:42:38] THOSE HAD THE WORD IN THEM. AND BY THAT
[1:42:40] HOLY SPIRIT COMING, IT BROUGHT THE WHOLE
[1:42:43] UNIT TOGETHER.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:48] IT COULD ONLY HAPPEN AT THAT TIME.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; AND I SAY AGAIN, AND THIS THAT YOU ARE
[1:42:55] HEARING CAN ONLY HAPPEN AT THIS TIME.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; We are ridiculed. We are spoken evil of
[1:43:02] by people. We're called A CULT OF THE
[1:43:05] DEVIL OF whatever more of heretics.
[1:43:07] WE'RE WORSHIPING SOME DEAD MAN. I'D LIKE
[1:43:10] TO KNOW WHAT PROPHET OF GOD IS DEAD.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; I'd like TO KNOW WHAT SAINT OF GOD IS
[1:43:16] DEAD.
[1:43:17] HALLELUJAH. JESUS SAID, "IF YOU BELIEVE
[1:43:19] IN ME, YOU SHALL NEVER DIE."
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; THERE'S PREACHERS WITHIN JUST BLOCKS OF
[1:43:25] HERE. PREACHERS WITHIN A FEW BLOCKS OF
[1:43:27] HERE TRYING TO SAY THAT WORSHIPING SOME
[1:43:29] DEAD MAN. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT OF SOME
[1:43:31] CATHOLIC FAITH worshiping some dead
[1:43:33] people.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; WE'RE IN FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LIVING GOD.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; AND WE BELIEVE THE SCRIPTURE, HE THAT
[1:43:43] BELIEVETH ON ME SHALL NEVER DIE.
[1:43:47] BELIEVEST THOU THIS?
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; OH, Martha says, "IN THE END TIME, I
[1:43:52] KNOW HE'LL RISE IN THE RESURRECTION." HE
[1:43:54] SAID, "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE
[1:43:56] LIFE." THIS SON OF MAN WHO VISIT HIMSELF
[1:43:59] HERE NOW AND WILL ACCOMPANY THIS WORD AS
[1:44:02] LONG AS IT'S PREACHED. HE IS THE
[1:44:04] RESURRECTION.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; As I've said many times before, we're
[1:44:10] not going to a resurrection. Those that
[1:44:12] are ASLEEP IN CHRIST, THEY ARE THE
[1:44:14] RESURRECTION. HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GOING TO A RAPTURE. WE ARE THE
[1:44:18] RAPTURE.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; And when the day OF NOT OF PENTECOST IS
[1:44:22] FULLY COME, BUT WHEN THE DAY OF THE
[1:44:24] RAPTURE IS FULLY COME, I CAN TELL YOU
[1:44:27] ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUAL PIECES WILL
[1:44:29] UNITE TOGETHER FOR THAT GREAT GATHERING
[1:44:32] MOMENT. AND WE'LL be there
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; together.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; It's going to be more real than it is
[1:44:39] right this moment.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; And I know I I just know myself.
[1:44:45] I'm going to be looking for you.
[1:44:47] I'm be looking. Say, I walked with them
[1:44:49] in life. We walked together. We labored.
[1:44:53] We prayed together. We washed feet
[1:44:54] together. We had communion together.
[1:44:57] Where are they? Oh, there they are. Oh,
[1:45:00] there they are. You talk about a
[1:45:02] rejoicing. YOU TALK ABOUT A REJOICING.
[1:45:05] YOU WON'T BE SITTING QUIET AS YOU ARE
[1:45:07] THIS MORNING. YOU'LL SAY, "I MADE IT. I
[1:45:10] MADE IT. I MADE IT. HALLELUJAH. I MADE
[1:45:13] IT.
[1:45:16] OH, GLORY TO GOD. NO MORE TEMPTATION.
[1:45:19] NO MORE STRANGE THOUGHTS. IT'LL ALL BE
[1:45:22] GONE. WHY? BECAUSE YOU HEARD THE WORD
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; AND YOU WERE UNITED TO THE WORD.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; OH, you think this kind of preaching is
[1:45:34] a little uh uh, you know,
[1:45:38] too demonstrative?
[1:45:40] I SEE THESE IDIOTS AT THE BALL GAME.
[1:45:44] WITH A LITTLE IF I WAS HERE TRYING TO
[1:45:46] GET YOU EXCITED OVER A LITTLE PIG SKIN
[1:45:49] OR A LITTLE HARD RUBBER PUCK AND SEE
[1:45:51] THEM BEAT THEIR FEET AND JUMP ON THEIR
[1:45:54] HATS AND DO ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS
[1:45:56] AND GET IN FIGHTS AND SLAM ONE ANOTHER.
[1:46:01] OH, the people look at that, they think
[1:46:02] that's normal.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; I think it's crazy. I think it's insane.
[1:46:07] BUT TO GET EXCITED OVER THIS GLORIOUS
[1:46:10] THING AND TO THINK WE HAVE INHERITED
[1:46:13] ETERNAL LIFE. NOT WE SHALL. WE HAVE
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS AN UNCONDITIONAL
[1:46:23] covenant
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; that sister Margaret SANG ABOUT
[1:46:28] UNCONDITIONAL AND BROTHER BRANDHAM TIES
[1:46:31] ANOTHER WORD TO UNCONDITIONAL. IF IT'S
[1:46:33] UNCONDITIONAL IT'S ETERNAL. IT'S ETERNAL
[1:46:37] BECAUSE UNCONDITIONAL HAS NO END.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BREAK IT. IT'S
[1:46:42] UNCONDITIONAL.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; UNCONDITIONAL. NOT IF YOU DO. HE SAID I
[1:46:51] HAVE.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BANNER MAKES ANOTHER
[1:46:54] STATEMENT. HE SAID IT'S NOT EVEN I WILL.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; LOTS OF TIMES God says I WILL DO THIS
[1:46:59] AND I WILL DO THAT AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE
[1:47:01] LAND AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE son and I'll
[1:47:03] do all of these things. BUT IN THIS
[1:47:05] CASE, HE SAYS, "I HAVE ALREADY DONE IT.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; It's finished.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; It's not if you measure up to a certain
[1:47:16] standard,
[1:47:18] he's already done it.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; It's finished." Amen.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, there isn't a person, not
[1:47:26] on the face of the earth out of five or
[1:47:29] six billion people that were here when
[1:47:31] God sent the his prophet messenger at
[1:47:33] this time, there wasn't one that had put
[1:47:34] in their order and said, "Oh, God, send
[1:47:36] Elijah."
[1:47:38] And if they did, they probably didn't
[1:47:39] even know what they were speaking of.
[1:47:42] But he sent him
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; because God said he will do it.
[1:47:47] And his first part of his covenant, he
[1:47:49] said he made a conditional covenant with
[1:47:51] Adam. Said if you do this, I'll do that.
[1:47:55] If you eat of this tree, you'll die.
[1:47:59] Went on. It was a conditional contract
[1:48:01] covenant.
[1:48:03] But now he talking to the serpent.
[1:48:06] He said, "I'm going to put enmity
[1:48:09] between you and the woman, and between
[1:48:11] your seed and her seed, AND HIS SEED
[1:48:15] SHALL, UNCONDITIONAL COVENANT SHALL
[1:48:20] BRUISE YOUR HEAD."
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; That's a part of the covenant you want
[1:48:25] to repeat. That's a part of the covenant
[1:48:27] THAT YOU WANT TO EXPRESS ON A REGULAR
[1:48:29] BASIS. AH, THE PART OF THE COVENANT IN
[1:48:32] ME IS THAT THIS SERPENT, THIS SATAN'S
[1:48:35] HEAD IS BRUISED.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; My goodness, time's gone. I haven't even
[1:48:44] started here.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; God's covenant
[1:48:53] with Abraham made up of many promises.
[1:48:59] Where's my son?
[1:49:01] God said, "Out of your own lines, he's
[1:49:02] going to come."
[1:49:05] You're going to bring a son out of your
[1:49:06] own lines, and that'll be your heir.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Look up to heaven and see the stars. See
[1:49:12] if you can count them. That's how your
[1:49:14] seed's going to be.
[1:49:19] And he believes God
[1:49:22] made a statement and it was counted to
[1:49:24] him for righteousness.
[1:49:30] Now I'm going TO GIVE YOU THIS LAND
[1:49:32] ALSO. I give you this land. Going to
[1:49:34] give you a seed. Not just a seed. Out of
[1:49:36] your own loins.
[1:49:39] And I'm going to give him this land.
[1:49:44] And in the same day,
[1:49:48] Abram said, "Well,
[1:49:50] how am I going to know that this is
[1:49:52] going to happen?" You know, I believe
[1:49:54] there's a lesson here for us because
[1:49:57] often we we hear it and we believe it
[1:50:00] because the Bible said pre previously he
[1:50:02] believed God and it was it was counted
[1:50:04] to him for righteousness. He believed
[1:50:06] it.
[1:50:08] But he said, "How will I know?"
[1:50:11] And so God was going to confirm the
[1:50:13] covenant to him and so that he knew. Now
[1:50:16] he said, "How will I know?" In other
[1:50:18] words, catch this please. How will I be
[1:50:22] irrevocably convinced so it can never
[1:50:24] never escape me again? How how will that
[1:50:27] be? How?
[1:50:30] He said, "Take these animals.
[1:50:33] Take a heer and a she goat and a ram and
[1:50:38] a turtle dove and a pigeon,
[1:50:41] the birds." Now, God didn't tell him to
[1:50:44] divide them, but he had asked, "Now, how
[1:50:48] will I know? I want a covenant to happen
[1:50:53] here. And so Abraham himself now, he
[1:50:57] took the animals.
[1:51:00] He divided them, cut them up.
[1:51:03] He spread them out, laid them there.
[1:51:07] He didn't go off someplace else and have
[1:51:09] a rest in his tent. He stood there with
[1:51:13] them because he knew this was covenant
[1:51:15] making. AND THE TWO PEOPLE MAKING THE
[1:51:18] COVENANT HAVE TO STAND OVER THE PIECES
[1:51:20] OF THE DEAD ANIMAL BECAUSE THIS IS THE
[1:51:23] COVENANT. And he he had heard it now THE
[1:51:26] COVENANT. NOW HE'S STANDING OVER THE
[1:51:27] PIECES. HE THAT WAS ALL HE COULD DO.
[1:51:32] But he was not the dark horror of
[1:51:35] darkness that came. That was God's part.
[1:51:38] Now God, Abraham did what he could do
[1:51:41] towards the covenant. Now God is showing
[1:51:43] him the rest. And the horror of darkness
[1:51:46] came. We didn't know what it was till a
[1:51:49] prophet come and said it was hell.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Hell, a horror
[1:51:57] of darkness. And in the midst of the
[1:52:00] darkness, a little light moving.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; OH, THANK GOD.
[1:52:06] EVEN IN THE MOST CRITICAL MOMENT, THERE
[1:52:09] CAME THAT LITTLE LIGHT BECAUSE THAT
[1:52:11] LIGHT WAS PART OF THE COVENANT,
[1:52:14] that sacred light moving through the
[1:52:16] pieces.
[1:52:19] And God testified to him,
[1:52:22] and this is the covenant that I make
[1:52:25] with you. This what's going to happen to
[1:52:28] your seed. They're going to go and be in
[1:52:29] bondage, etc., etc., but I'm going to
[1:52:31] deliver them.
[1:52:32] And so God writes his covenant and he
[1:52:36] was showing
[1:52:38] you know this well but carry on with me
[1:52:40] a moment. He was showing him Calvary
[1:52:44] and at Calvary.
[1:52:47] Now notice
[1:52:52] here was this unit
[1:52:55] called Jesus Christ of Nazareth the son
[1:52:58] of God.
[1:53:00] Now he was just going to go into
[1:53:02] different different elements.
[1:53:05] He was now just going to part
[1:53:08] and the blood was going to go one
[1:53:10] direction
[1:53:11] and the spirit was going to go another
[1:53:13] direction.
[1:53:15] The spirit would rise to GOD BECAUSE IT
[1:53:19] COULD NOT BE SEPARATED from God. BUT THE
[1:53:22] BODY WENT TO THE tomb and the blood went
[1:53:26] to the earth. And they WERE ALL MAKING A
[1:53:28] STATEMENT. The earth is mine.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; AND THE FULLNESS THEREOF. AND SATAN, YOU
[1:53:36] HAVE YOU HAVE GOTTEN IT BY A FRAUD. BUT
[1:53:39] I'M TAKING IT BACK.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; I'M SPILLING THIS RIGHTEOUS BLOOD at
[1:53:44] creation OF ALMIGHTY GOD ON THIS EARTH
[1:53:47] AND I'M CLAIMING IT BACK.
[1:53:51] And even though there'd be multitudes
[1:53:54] hearing just today, I thought how sad it
[1:53:56] was here in the poor country of Iraq and
[1:54:00] the United States training up special
[1:54:03] forces and special police of the Iraqi
[1:54:06] army and the insurgents and the rebels
[1:54:09] who are causing so much DISTRESS AND
[1:54:11] TROUBLE. YOU THINK of and and and they
[1:54:14] they came in and seized a a police
[1:54:17] office and took the contents of the
[1:54:20] office. 21 officers took them. That just
[1:54:23] happened. 21 officers took these police,
[1:54:26] TOOK THEM OUT, AND SHOT EVERY ONE OF
[1:54:28] THEM. OH, I'm not I'm not saying that to
[1:54:33] be sensational.
[1:54:35] That happened in the real world. That
[1:54:38] happened just very close to where
[1:54:40] brother Tony and Sister Rebecca are. And
[1:54:43] when I heard that and I thought about it
[1:54:45] today, I thought we've got some police
[1:54:47] officers in our church. We got some men
[1:54:49] in special forces and so on. Some
[1:54:52] mothers without a son.
[1:54:55] Some wife is without a husband.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; They've been stripped of the very love
[1:55:00] of their life. Some children today,
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; right now
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; whose HEARTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY
[1:55:08] EMPTIED OUT,
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE DADDY WON'T come home again.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; He's gone. The own countrymen TOOK THEIR
[1:55:17] LIFE. 21. JUST BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM,
[1:55:20] BOOM. And they're gone. Wiped off. I
[1:55:24] thought they've been stripped of
[1:55:27] everything that is precious to them. You
[1:55:30] children, you young people, what would
[1:55:33] you do if you had to wake UP AND HEAR
[1:55:35] SUCH A CATASTROPHIC THING, SUCH A
[1:55:38] HORRIFIC THING HAS happened
[1:55:41] in my country to my father.
[1:55:46] These separations that I was talking
[1:55:48] about two Wednesdays ago, they're
[1:55:51] severe, they're bitter, and they're
[1:55:55] terrible. But I tell you one, there's
[1:55:58] one separation you and I cannot afford.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm preaching today. We
[1:56:03] cannot come up before him and find and
[1:56:06] hear THESE WORDS. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO
[1:56:08] HEAR THESE WORDS. Depart
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; from me.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; You workers of iniquity. AND THE PROPHET
[1:56:16] SAID, "INIQUITY, IT'S NOT SOME
[1:56:18] PROSTITUTION LIFE OUT THERE OR SOME
[1:56:21] DRUNKENNESS OR RIVALRY. IT IS THEY HEARD
[1:56:23] THE TRUTH AND KNEW THE TRUTH AND REFUSED
[1:56:26] TO DO IT.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; INIQUITY.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; WE CANNOT HEAR THAT. Depart
[1:56:35] from me.
[1:56:37] Oh,
[1:56:39] that's something that's constantly in my
[1:56:41] mind. That's why we preach with the
[1:56:44] fervor that we do. That's why we pull
[1:56:47] with everything that's in us. You young
[1:56:49] men and young women that have the pull
[1:56:51] OF THE WORLD, REMEMBER JESUS SAID HE'S A
[1:56:55] THIEF.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTS TO ROB FROM YOU YOUR YOUTH.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO ROB FROM YOU YOUR PURITY. HE
[1:57:02] WANTS TO DRAG YOU DOWN INTO THE MUD. HE
[1:57:05] WANTS TO ROB from the homes the the
[1:57:08] BLESSEDNESS OF THE ONENESS AND THE
[1:57:10] BEAUTY AND THE PURITY AND THE HOLINESS
[1:57:13] AND THE LOVE. HE WANTS TO TAKE LOVE FROM
[1:57:15] THE HOME. HE WANTS TO TAKE THE RESPECT
[1:57:18] OUT OF THE HEARTS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE OR
[1:57:20] THE WIFE FOR THE HUSBAND OR THE HUSBAND
[1:57:21] FOR THE WIFE. HE'S A ROBBER.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; BUT LET THIS CHURCH STAND UP AND RISE
[1:57:27] SAY WE DENY HIM THAT PRIVILEGE.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; I DENY HIM THAT.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; I STAND HERE UPON THE WORD OF GOD, UPON
[1:57:36] THE IRREVOCABLE COVENANT OF ALMIGHTY
[1:57:38] GOD.
[1:57:40] AMEN.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; This word STANDS FIRM
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; AND I STAND FIRM ON THIS WORD AND I
[1:57:46] DON'T CARE. THIS GENERATION IS SO
[1:57:48] PERVERTED AND SO TWISTED AND IT HAS SO
[1:57:51] SEVERED AND DISMEMBERED UNTIL we become
[1:57:54] accustomed to it.
[1:57:57] Don't ever become accustomed to it.
[1:58:00] Don't ever let that thing get in your
[1:58:02] heart. You measured by the word of God.
[1:58:06] And the prophet said
[1:58:12] when God could come down
[1:58:14] and talk with them lift to ear,
[1:58:18] they were in harmony. In harmony,
[1:58:22] he said that is oneness.
[1:58:27] And I know these things are hard to say
[1:58:29] because of the generation we're in, but
[1:58:30] I'm going to say it anyway.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; There should be harmony between husbands
[1:58:34] and wives.
[1:58:35] There should be harmony between children
[1:58:37] and parents.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; There should be harmony between brother
[1:58:40] and brother and sister and sister and
[1:58:42] brothers and sisters and sisters and
[1:58:43] brothers. There should be harmony and
[1:58:46] THAT KIND OF A CHURCH WILL BE A CHURCH
[1:58:47] OF INCREDIBLE POWER.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; INCREDIBLE UNSPEAKABLE POWER. AND
[1:58:54] THEY'LL UNITE TOGETHER AND THEY WILL
[1:58:56] PRAY. GOD WILL ANSWER.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:03] It may sound like a dream to you. It
[1:59:05] must not be a dream. That is the truth
[1:59:07] of God's word.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Let's live by every word of God.
[1:59:15] Oh, there's just so much, friend. Just
[1:59:16] so much. I've been so consumed with this
[1:59:19] whole subject and I must I must close
[1:59:22] because time is slipping away on us. But
[1:59:25] there were so many parts.
[1:59:28] But I think I've conveyed to you the
[1:59:31] critical parts of this
[1:59:34] this word that you've been called under.
[1:59:37] This is not a message of as such that
[1:59:40] has been initiated by Cloverdale Bible
[1:59:43] Way.
[1:59:45] This is the one thing that Gerson
[1:59:46] Solomon,
[1:59:48] he was really
[1:59:51] uh I would say not bothered but it was
[1:59:52] trouble. He wanted to get the question
[1:59:54] answered. want to know where did this
[1:59:56] thing start?
[1:59:59] Where did this thing start? He says, "I
[2:00:01] hear about you people all over the
[2:00:02] world." He said, "I hear from about you
[2:00:06] from Africa and from Europe." He said,
[2:00:10] "Up in Scandinavia."
[2:00:12] He said, "People contact me." And I
[2:00:14] said, "Well, who are you?" Well, he
[2:00:16] said, "Well, you know, Brother Bisco,
[2:00:18] you know, yes, yes, yes." And Cloverdale
[2:00:20] Bible said, "We're the same."
[2:00:24] And he's just hearing that all over.
[2:00:25] We're the same. We're the same. We're
[2:00:27] the same. He says, "Where did you
[2:00:28] start?" He said to me, "Are you the
[2:00:31] founder?" I said, "Oh, no. I'm not the
[2:00:32] founder."
[2:00:35] But he said, "You must be, you know, the
[2:00:37] main person." I said, "No, no, no. You
[2:00:39] got it all wrong." And I said, "You've
[2:00:42] heard me talk to you about Brother
[2:00:43] Brandom." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I said,
[2:00:45] "That's where this really started.
[2:00:47] That's where this began. This was
[2:00:48] something that God done." I'm so glad,
[2:00:50] friends, I can say to you, then
[2:00:54] then will the son of man be revealed.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; What would you and I do today if we had
[2:00:59] to go out and face the world that we're
[2:01:01] in?
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; And I don't want you to think that I'm a
[2:01:04] negative person, but I I walk out, I
[2:01:06] walk the streets, I walk through the
[2:01:08] community, I drive, I have contact with
[2:01:09] a lot of people, and on a regular basis,
[2:01:12] I say th this is an insane institution.
[2:01:16] I am walking through an insane
[2:01:18] institution. I want to say something to
[2:01:19] you.
[2:01:21] I've been in the insane institutions
[2:01:24] many times and they weren't as bad as
[2:01:27] what I face on the streets.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; I've never had anybody tried to stab me
[2:01:31] or kill me or anything else. But on the
[2:01:34] streets, you don't know what's going to
[2:01:35] happen.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; The worst I saw an insane institution.
[2:01:39] They want to give a big man an
[2:01:40] injection. He didn't want the injection
[2:01:42] and he roared.
[2:01:44] Almost scared me, but he didn't want
[2:01:46] that injection. And I didn't blame him.
[2:01:49] They want to turn him into some kind of
[2:01:50] zombie. So he just walk around like
[2:01:53] that.
[2:01:54] That's the worst I saw.
[2:01:58] But it's not the worst I saw in the
[2:01:59] streets
[2:02:01] on the streets of your town. The people
[2:02:03] you have to rub shoulders with. You say,
[2:02:05] "Well, it doesn't look that bad." Just a
[2:02:07] second.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; If it starts getting that way to you,
[2:02:10] well, it doesn't look that bad.
[2:02:18] Don't get used to it.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Don't get accustomed to it.
[2:02:24] There's something else you might not
[2:02:26] understand.
[2:02:29] God's going to God's going to burn it.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; God's going to burn it.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, there's a lot of
[2:02:35] nice people." That is for sure. Going to
[2:02:37] be a lot of nice people go to hell.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:40] a lot of good a lot of good uh good
[2:02:43] thinking people and good reasonable
[2:02:45] people and all the rest of it. And
[2:02:46] that's where your mind's going to run
[2:02:48] out of space. You say, "Well, how come
[2:02:49] that's not for you and I?" But that's
[2:02:51] what this word says.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; And the false prophet and the beast and
[2:02:57] that trinity going to be cast into the
[2:02:59] lake of fire and those that followed
[2:03:02] him, those that loved it. I'll tell you
[2:03:03] what, this world and you're in contact
[2:03:05] with multitudes of people that love that
[2:03:07] spirit. Amen.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; They love that godless spirit. They love
[2:03:11] the god-haters of the world and they're
[2:03:13] part of it.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; But there's another group of people
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; getting ready to leave.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; And they are going to leave because they
[2:03:26] can't be left behind.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; They've already been already been
[2:03:32] inseparably
[2:03:34] united.
[2:03:38] Hallelujah.
[2:03:40] Oh, I thank God. Next time you hear a
[2:03:44] message or read a message and you hear
[2:03:48] and see that revealing of the son of man
[2:03:50] taking place,
[2:03:52] you see the you you see that operation
[2:03:55] of the prophet ministry and you oh, you
[2:03:57] think that was wonderful for those
[2:03:59] people. My I'd like to have been back
[2:04:01] there and had had the secret of my heart
[2:04:03] revealed. Oh, brother Biscll, you were
[2:04:05] so privileged. You You sat with them and
[2:04:08] you were in the same tent and you spent
[2:04:10] days and even weeks together. It was so
[2:04:13] privileged. But I say you're even more
[2:04:15] privileged.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; You're more privileged.
[2:04:19] You say, "Well, how was that?" Well,
[2:04:21] because you believed without seeing.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; But when you hear these things,
[2:04:29] I want you to I want you to grasp one
[2:04:31] thing. God did all of this
[2:04:34] for you.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Just just give me a couple minutes.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave this.
[2:04:45] The Bible says
[2:04:50] that
[2:04:53] God
[2:04:55] took of the rib
[2:04:58] of Adam
[2:05:02] and he made a woman
[2:05:07] and brought her to the man. God did
[2:05:11] that.
[2:05:14] He took a rib and here's what the exact
[2:05:17] Greek text says
[2:05:20] and Jehovah God
[2:05:22] formed the ri which he had taken from
[2:05:26] the man into a woman
[2:05:30] and brought
[2:05:32] to and brought her in to the man.
[2:05:38] actually took a part of
[2:05:42] Christ
[2:05:44] and formed
[2:05:46] of that rib into a woman.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just poof,
[2:05:54] but he formed her into a woman. And then
[2:05:58] that same God brought her to the man.
[2:06:02] And I became intrigued with this. He
[2:06:05] made her
[2:06:08] He made her. And I felt and that's why I
[2:06:12] stopped here. I felt very very impressed
[2:06:16] to say this to you as a congregation.
[2:06:20] God
[2:06:21] made us made you for Christ. This word
[2:06:27] he made you.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; He actually formed you.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; That's why you didn't fit in so many
[2:06:33] places. He actually formed and shaped
[2:06:36] you.
[2:06:37] to fit perfectly with this word.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Made the two of you one.
[2:06:46] And I went into that made he made you.
[2:06:50] It says that he actually fashioned and
[2:06:55] formed.
[2:06:57] But he says another thing, the word made
[2:07:00] is that he put he put it in order. And I
[2:07:04] got thinking about my own life, my own
[2:07:07] got thinking about the different people
[2:07:09] that are here and how he had to bring an
[2:07:11] order, an order perhaps even to your
[2:07:14] geographic location. Had to bring an
[2:07:17] order to your thinking, an order to your
[2:07:19] whole relationship.
[2:07:21] He had to put it in order. And then it
[2:07:25] secondly, it also is
[2:07:28] that he purchased it. Actually, it it is
[2:07:32] that he owns it. He bought it. He didn't
[2:07:34] just put it in order. Isn't something
[2:07:36] when God was done and then he brought
[2:07:39] her to the man. Do you realize that
[2:07:42] what's ever happened in your life and
[2:07:43] everybody's story is entirely different?
[2:07:47] Do you hear me?
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; God
[2:07:52] God has been working in your life to
[2:07:55] will and do his own will. And he BROUGHT
[2:07:57] YOU
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; STEP BY STEP. BROUGHT you to the man.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; DIDN'T BRING YOU THERE SO YOU BE TWO
[2:08:06] INDIVIDUALS. BROUGHT YOU TO THIS CHRIST
[2:08:09] SO THAT HE COULD MERGE YOU AND MAKE YOU
[2:08:12] into one single unit.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; I've conducted a lot of weddings and I
[2:08:17] come here and often SAY GOD INSTITUTED
[2:08:20] marriage back in the Garden of Eden. It
[2:08:23] was God who instituted it.
[2:08:26] Let me tell you, God, he's the one who
[2:08:29] designed this marriage.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE IT'S WONDERFUL WHEN A
[2:08:34] BRIDE AND GROOM COME UP IN ALL OF their
[2:08:35] beauty of youth. BUT GOD ORDAINED, HE
[2:08:38] DID SOMETHING MORE WONDERFUL. SOMETIMES
[2:08:40] HE DIDN'T TAKE SOME BEAUTIFUL THING. HE
[2:08:42] TOOK SOME RAG TAG OFF THE STREETS. HE
[2:08:45] TOOK SOME DRUNK. HE TOOK WHATEVER. HE
[2:08:47] TOOK THE LOWEST. HE TOOK THE SCUM. HE
[2:08:49] TOOK PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THEIR
[2:08:50] OWN INTELLIGENCE.
[2:08:54] HE TOOK PEOPLE THAT WERE SO BOUND.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; I LOOKED ACROSS THIS CONGREGATION. SOME
[2:08:59] OF YOU WERE IN SUCH DARKNESS. WE ALL
[2:09:00] WERE. BUT HE TOOK YOU. YOU WERE IN SUCH
[2:09:02] A STATE OF AFFAIRS. AND GOD BEGIN TO WOO
[2:09:05] YOU AND DRAW YOU. HE HAD ONE THING IN
[2:09:07] HIS MIND. A MARRIAGE. A MARRIAGE FOR MY
[2:09:10] SON. I'M GOING TO BRING HIM A WIFE. I'M
[2:09:12] MAKING THIS I'M MAKING THIS ONE FOR HIM.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; You've been made for him.
[2:09:22] You've been actually made for him.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN CREATED for him. The very
[2:09:28] makeup
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; he's making, he's made you for him. Oh,
[2:09:33] what a wonderful,
[2:09:35] wonderful thing.
[2:09:39] Do you take this man
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; to be your lawful wed husband? To have
[2:09:44] and to hold from this day forward,
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; for better, for worse, in sickness and
[2:09:49] in health. AND WHATEVER HAPPENS, YOU
[2:09:51] TAKE HIM TO BE YOUR OWN.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:59] Let's stand.
[2:10:07] Oh father
[2:10:09] God of covenants,
[2:10:12] God of promises,
[2:10:14] God who has made such serious and
[2:10:18] righteous covenant with your people, not
[2:10:23] dependent upon whether we will or
[2:10:27] whether we can. In many cases, we can't.
[2:10:31] We haven't got the inner fortitude. We
[2:10:34] haven't got what it takes. But you have
[2:10:37] more than what it takes. And then you
[2:10:40] send the Holy Spirit of God upon us and
[2:10:43] into us to unite the bride and the
[2:10:46] bridegroom together. Lord, may we I I
[2:10:50] pray may this have a uh a new sense of
[2:10:54] awareness
[2:10:56] upon us and in the people and throughout
[2:10:58] today, a consciousness. May it be a
[2:11:02] PRESENCE THAT WILL ENVELOP US AND
[2:11:04] SURROUND US. AND LET THE presence
[2:11:07] permeate us.
[2:11:09] Oh, eternal God.
[2:11:13] May the things that were spoken today,
[2:11:15] Lord, help that the words of my mouth
[2:11:20] have been uttered and penetrate into the
[2:11:23] deepest parts
[2:11:25] of the hearts and understanding of your
[2:11:28] people. I pray that you'll move, oh God,
[2:11:33] upon some that may be standing here now
[2:11:35] that know in THEIR HEART OF HEARTS that
[2:11:38] they have not made preparation.
[2:11:41] They have not accepted. They have not
[2:11:43] yielded. They've not given themselves
[2:11:46] unreservedly. May they at this moment
[2:11:48] say, "Oh my God,
[2:11:51] take me the way I am. COVENANTKEEPING
[2:11:55] FATHER GOD, TAKE ME AND I ACCEPT YOUR
[2:11:59] SACRIFICE OF CALVARY. I ACCEPT THE
[2:12:01] SEPARENCE OF your son. How he was
[2:12:04] severed from you, that I might be united
[2:12:08] with you.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; HE BECAME NAKED THAT I MIGHT BE CLOTHED.
[2:12:12] HE WAS REPROACHED AND MADE ASHAMED TO IN
[2:12:16] the eyes of the people that I might be
[2:12:18] accepted. HE WAS BROKEN THAT I MIGHT BE
[2:12:22] HEALED, that I might be whole.
[2:12:25] Oh God, I pray you'll make this closet
[2:12:30] BY THE HOLY SPIRIT to be a reality
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; upon each one.
[2:12:36] And I would urge if there are those that
[2:12:39] are standing and say, "These are strange
[2:12:42] things. I've never heard them before,
[2:12:43] but there's something in my heart that
[2:12:46] is saying yay and amen.
[2:12:50] I ask and would counsel you now to make
[2:12:53] that prayer to Christ.
[2:12:56] Just say, I give myself to you. I
[2:12:59] surrender myself to you. And maybe while
[2:13:02] you're contemplating this or making this
[2:13:06] prayer,
[2:13:08] we can just sing, I surrender all. I
[2:13:10] surrender all. all to Jesus. I
[2:13:13] surrender.
[2:13:14] I surrender all. Those of you, you don't
[2:13:17] need the words. [music] So, you can just
[2:13:20] have your eyes closed and and pray for
[2:13:24] that one. [music] Or those that are just
[2:13:28] think there are some that perhaps have
[2:13:30] not got peace with God. They haven't
[2:13:33] been united. Wouldn't it be, isn't it
[2:13:35] our desire, people, saints of God, to
[2:13:39] see perhaps one stray sheep?
[2:13:44] Just come back into the fold, one prodal
[2:13:47] son,
[2:13:48] one daughter that's still wewarded.
[2:13:51] [music]
[2:13:52] Let them come now, Lord. Let them come.
[2:13:56] I pray that this word I've spoken this
[2:13:58] morning will not be fruitless,
[2:14:01] but it'll bring forth much fruit, Lord,
[2:14:06] for your glory.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; For your glory alone,
[2:14:12] I
[2:14:14] surrender
[2:14:16] [music]
[2:14:17] all.
[2:14:22] [music]
[2:14:23] I
[2:14:26] surrender
[2:14:29] all [music]
[2:14:35] to thee. My lavior. [music]
[2:14:44] [chant]
[2:14:46] [music]
[2:14:51] Oh, I
[2:14:53] surrender
[2:14:57] all. [music]
[2:15:00] I know.
[2:15:02] I [music]
[2:15:04] surrender
[2:15:07] all
[2:15:12] [music]
[2:15:15] to
[2:15:17] my [music] blessed.
[2:15:26] [music]
[2:15:30] All that I have and all that I ever can
[2:15:33] be and will [music] be.
[2:15:35] All that I am. [music]
[2:15:41] All
[2:15:44] I am, [music]
[2:15:47] all
[2:15:49] I shall ever
[2:15:52] [music]
[2:15:58] [music]
[2:16:03] the love that [music]
[2:16:06] I
[2:16:10] I
[2:16:12] surrender
[2:16:13] [music] to thee
[2:16:17] together now.
[2:16:20] All [music]
[2:16:21] that I am
[2:16:24] now. All that I am. [music]
[2:16:30] All
[2:16:32] I shall ever [music]
[2:16:35] be.
[2:16:40] is
[2:16:42] [music]
[2:16:45] the love that [music]
[2:16:48] I
[2:16:53] surrender [music]
[2:16:55] to thee.
[2:17:01] [music]
[2:17:04] I wonder if you are here and you want
[2:17:08] prayer in your life.
[2:17:10] this congregation to pray with you and
[2:17:12] for you. All you need to do [music]
[2:17:16] stand and say, "Lord,
[2:17:18] I make my heart an altar right where I
[2:17:20] am.
[2:17:24] And through sin and this natural birth,
[2:17:27] I was separated from you. But you have
[2:17:29] made a way for me to become one, united
[2:17:34] with you." [music] Maybe someone's I've
[2:17:36] been living a cold and different life,
[2:17:41] not very fervent.
[2:17:43] But I realize today again [music]
[2:17:46] I cannot take this in some casual way.
[2:17:50] This is not a casual gospel. It's a
[2:17:53] gospel that burns with the fire of God.
[2:17:57] Oh God, burn within our soul and our
[2:18:01] heart.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Touch every life of the living flesh.
[2:18:09] Those, oh God, that have not been united
[2:18:11] by the full baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[2:18:15] [music]
[2:18:17] may you baptize them. You are that
[2:18:19] baptizer.
[2:18:21] Many, oh, been baptized in water and
[2:18:23] perhaps some have not been baptized with
[2:18:27] the Holy Ghost. as they receive the
[2:18:30] word,
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; as they accept it, Lord, as they
[2:18:33] internalize it, [music] may the Holy
[2:18:35] Spirit in his faithfulness, I know that
[2:18:38] you will come to it and give them that
[2:18:43] experience for indeed it is an
[2:18:46] experience. We thank you, Father.
[2:18:50] Thank you, Father.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, oh God.
[2:18:59] Hallelujah.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless the Lord. Bless the Lord.
[2:19:08] Bless the Lord.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; You know, friends, as we speak about
[2:19:12] crossing over
[2:19:14] in that land that we
[2:19:18] shall inherit.
[2:19:22] How marvelous.
[2:19:24] You bus drivers won't go and face what
[2:19:26] you face. you factory workers, you
[2:19:29] wives, your children, [music]
[2:19:32] some of the schools that you go to, the
[2:19:34] colleges,
[2:19:35] there be no such a thing. There is a
[2:19:38] place of righteousness. [music]
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; There is
[2:19:44] a land
[2:19:46] of milk and honey. There is [music] our
[2:19:53] where [singing]
[2:19:57] there is a landing [music]
[2:20:02] with us.
[2:20:05] There [music]
[2:20:06] we shall see our blessed
[2:20:12] [music]
[2:20:15] [singing] reason.
[2:20:18] Hallelujah.
[2:20:21] Praise [music] God.
[2:20:25] The river and mighty
[2:20:29] river.
[2:20:31] [music]
[2:20:35] We shall see [music]
[2:20:37] our blessing.
[2:20:41] That's the reason and
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; that's [music] the reason we shout
[2:20:48] hallelujah
[2:20:50] [music]
[2:20:57] shining [music]
[2:20:59] river.
[2:21:03] [music]
[2:21:04] There we shall see how blessed. [music]
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Keep it right in the front of your mind
[2:21:16] and settle it for once and for all.
[2:21:21] Don't ever have another doubt.
[2:21:23] [music]
[2:21:24] At that moment of that change, that
[2:21:26] moment when we cross over, wherever it
[2:21:28] is, whether it be [music] by life or by
[2:21:30] death, at that moment, and I hear that
[2:21:33] voice [music] once more,
[2:21:36] enter in.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Enter in. [music] Be blessed of the
[2:21:41] Lord. Hallelujah. Brother Roy Ford, I
[2:21:45] wonder if you would come, please dismiss
[2:21:47] us in prayer. if you would please
[2:21:52] [music]
[2:21:59] that that's the reason [music]
[2:22:03] we shout
[2:22:07] [music]
[2:22:08] our king
[2:22:10] across the river that shining [music]
[2:22:16] Where the saints will gather.
[2:22:21] There [music]
[2:22:21] we shall see our
[2:22:25] Messiah. [music]
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; All together. Repeat after me. There I
[2:22:31] shall see.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; There I shall see
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; my blessed Messiah.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; My blessed Messiah.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; That is uttered out of your mouth.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; God heard it.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; The devil heard it. And I'm glad he
[2:22:46] heard it.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Roy in prayer.
