Amen. It's been an [music] extended process. We're just asking that God would move on their behalf. Amen. [music] And there's a request from our brother Milco, brother Adamas from Munich, Germany. [music] He's asking the church to pray for his wife Blazena. She's been diagnosed with menitis, but they refuse to believe this. They said, "My confession is simply one sentence. All things are possible." Amen. Amen. [music] Let's remember our brother Kyle and Victoria this morning. And brother Tom, would you come please open the service for us in a word of prayer. If there's a request on your heart that you just like to let [music] be known for the congregation with an upraised hand and God sees every hand. God bless you. Amen. Thank you. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer now. Heavenly Father, as we have sung songs of worship to you, we sense your nearness here this morning. Brothers and sisters of like precious faith have gathered. [music] They have gathered to worship you, the true and living God this morning. [music] that we could lift up our voices in adoration, praise and glory to the lamb who is worthy. Lord, we want to lift up our voice to you this morning. Say, Lord, you are more than worthy. We glorify you for the goodness of God within our lives. Lord, for redemption's price that was paid. And Lord, the benefits that we are drawing on it from it this morning. Lord, we can truly say, Lord Jesus, because you live, I live also. And Lord, we're going to draw on that benefit this morning. You said, "I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." Lord, we're going to draw on that promise this morning. Our brother Thomas, Lord, has has a need for his wife. We pray, God, that you will meet that need. [music] Our brother Jean has a need this morning. Lord, we pray that you will meet that need. Lord, various hands have gone up, Lord, and they're burdened. Their hearts are crying out. Their souls are thirsty. Lord, would you meet their need this morning? Father God, we'll be sure to give you all the glory [music] to your holy name. And Father, as we've come to hear the word, would you use Brother Ed in a special way? Lord, we have come hungering. We have come thirsty. We have come with great expectation in our hearts to see the Holy Ghost move and lives be changed and needs being met. Lord, we're going to draw on that promise this morning. You said, "Hunger and thirst after righteousness, you shall be filled. [music] Fill each one. Meet their need, and we'll be sure to give you all the glory, [music] the honor, and the praise. Bless this service now. [music] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. [music] Amen. You may have your seats and want to welcome everyone into the house of the Lord this morning and greet you with a God bless you and those who are joining us by way of streaming. We just trust that you would feel a part of the service this morning. I'm going to invite our sister Elizabeth Neighbor to come. She has a song for us. And as she's coming, we have an announcement. Winter camp is 3 weeks away. We must have registration as well as rental forms and payment in by January 30th. So, it's not very far away. So, we encourage everyone to please get your camp registration forms in as soon as possible. Amen. We maybe while they're setting up, why don't we sing uh fill my cup, Lord, I lift it up. Oh, fill my cup, Lord. [music] Oh, I lift [singing] it up, Lord. [music] Oh, come and quench [singing] this thirsting of my soul. [music] Oh, bread [singing] of heaven. [music] will see me till I want no [music] more. Here's my [singing] cup. Fill it up and make [music] me whole. Is that your desire this morning? Why don't we sing it again? Oh, [singing] till [music] my cup, Lord, I lift it [singing] up, Lord. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Come and quench this thirsty [singing and music] of my soul and bread of [singing] heaven. Feed [music] me till I want no more. Use my cup. [music] Fill it up and take me home. Oh, aside. I [music] separate for the Holy Ghost to pray through. [music] I wait for words to reach these [music] lips to set in motion [music] change. I have no way [music] by fleshly mind to know the glorious things he'll do. [music] I'm just set aside in [music] prayer. I abide [singing] Impossible, unthinkable, [music] amazing what God does. [music] He orchestrates all circumstance. [music] His ways are far above. [music] The winds of sovereignty now blow across the saint [music] that groans to convey the will of God on earth in [music] human hearts reborn. set aside. I [music] separate for the Holy Ghost [music] to pray through. I wait for words to [music] reach these lips to set in motion change. I have no way [music] my fleshly mind to know the glorious things [music] he'll do. I'm set aside in [music] prayer. I abide [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Faith gives forth [music] an utterance my eyes can't visualize. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Truth resounds within my frame. Though vile dark [music] forces lie, these stages of deliverance [music and singing] are seasons to refine. [music] Hardship molded voices confirmed by supernal signs. It's [music] the victory of submission [music] that releases the power of God. [music] A selfless realm untouched by man where he [music] reveals [singing] his will and plan. [music] A father's faith reached a prod [music] with the swine. Legion the demon bound a man till the son [music] of God restored his mind. For one lost lamb you gave the [music] 99 [singing] running seeking [music] pursuing to restore them one more time. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I set [singing] aside the Holy Ghost to break through. I wait [music] for words to reach these lips [music] to set in motion change. I have no way by fleshly mind to know the glorious things he'll [music] do. I'm just set aside. [music] Lord, set aside. [music] Set aside. [music] Are [music] you born? [music] Amen. Set ourselves aside this morning for God to do what he wants with this service. Amen. Amen. As the Sunday school children are coming, maybe the brothers could just prepare to take up the morning offering. Amen. And as they're coming, why don't we sing in moments like these? I lift up my hands [music] and we have a car in the parking lot of Washington plate Volkswagen blue with your lights on 621. I think it's VWN. So if you drive a blue Volkswagen, you may want to make sure your lights [music] are turned off. Amen. We've got the power, but you might not have any power after the service if you don't [music] go turn your lights off. Amen. In moments like these, I sing out a song as the brothers would prepare for the offering. in moments [singing] like [music] these. Oh, I sing out [singing] a song. Yes, I sing out [music and singing] a song to Jesus. [singing] It's in [music] moments my [music and singing] lift up my hands. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I lift [singing] up my hands to the Lord. We're [music] singing. [music] Oh, singing [music] [singing] to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I love you. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Brother Doug, would you commence the blessing on the offering this morning? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're thankful this morning be able to be gathered in your presence where we've set aside this time, this day, Lord, to worship and to sing praises, [music] to get along with you, Lord, just to have you speak to us. Lord, you blessed us in many ways, Lord. You blessed us with freedom to [music] come and gather unashamed, unhindered, Lord, that others in this world don't have those freedoms. Lord, we're thankful for that. We're thankful, Lord, for the ministry that you've placed [music] here, Lord, to feed us, to bring us up a little higher, Lord. Lord, to be able to catch what you [music] would have for us, Lord. You blessed us in many ways. Lord, [music] as we return at this time, Lord, we pray that you would just take this offering that's about to be [music] uh gathered, Lord. We just pray that you would use it to the uses it's intended. Lord, I pray that you would bless it and multiply it, Lord. that your word would be spread throughout the world, needs be met, that you would use it as a blessing to someone else somewhere else. And Lord, I just pray that you just be with us the rest of this service. Again, as brother [music] Thomas prayed, that you'd bless Brother Biscll as he would come, Lord, that you would use him to bring to us what you would have for us. Pray you would take all distractions out of the way, Lord, as the enemy would come and try to make our minds wander. Think about [music] this afternoon or tomorrow or yesterday, Lord. That you would allow us that opportunity, Lord, just to get alone with you for a little while. That you would speak to us, Lord, minister to needs. And Lord, we just want to commit this day and this time [music] to you. That you'd be honored and glorified through it. We ask this now the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; In moment [singing] [music] like these. Oh, I [singing] sing out [music] a song. Oh, I sing out [singing] a love song to Jesus. [music] Oh, at moment like these, Lord, I lift up [music] my hands. I lift [singing] up my hands to [music] the Lord. Sing I [music] love you, Lord. Sing [music] I [singing] love you, Lord. [music] Sing I [singing] love you, [music] Lord. [singing] Singing I love [music] the Lord. Sing it [singing] out. I love you, Lord. [music] Oh, sing I love you, Lord. [music] or single you. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to invite [music] our brother Joel, sister Kim Ray to come have their baby dedicated. Turn the service to our brother Tom. Maybe as they come sing Jesus loves me. This I know. [music] Aren't you glad the Bible tells us that Jesus loves us? Amen. And he sent a messenger in this age to remind us once again just how much he loves us. [music] Amen. So we sing this as they come. [music] Oh [singing] Jesus loves me. This I know. Oh [music] for the Bible tells me so. And little ones who [music] belong. They are weak, but he is strong. [music] Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, [music] Jesus loves me. Yes, [music] Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me [music] so. &gt;&gt; The reason why I asked Brother Ryan to sing that is because that was the first song I ever learned at church. And I can't imagine that uh parents that I had, lovely parents that they were, but they were they're they were the ones that dropped me off and never came to church. But I had the privilege of coming to church and learning Jesus loves me. Not realizing of course that there was a seed in me that God was drawing and that seed would bring forth other seed and they stand here today by the grace of God. We have Joel and Kimberly Ray standing here with her darling little daughter Stella Adon Ray. Brother Glenn is in the back smiling big mother is at home not well but she'll be streaming and watching this baby dedication. There's a scripture in the book of Revelation 2 and 28. The Bible says, "And I will give him the morning star." Well, Stella means star and her middle name is dawn. And brother Brandham said this. He said, "Jesus said himself, he that overcome will I give him the morning star." Joel Kim, these are personal promises that we can draw on ourselves. And we've overcome the wicked one. Joel, Sister Kim, you've overcome. And I've given you a star. &gt;&gt; I will give him the morning star. The Bible said, "What is it? Is an overcomer. One that has overcome the world. An overcomer of self. An overcomer of pride. I'll make him the morning star. And what will that do? I'll shine him up and set him up there. My oncoming power will reflect his own presence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In darkness. And he that overcomes will I give the morning star. &gt;&gt; Is the sun shining against it? It's reflecting the presence of the coming sun. Two people had to come to a place within their lives of overcoming for Christ to give them the morning star. And because of that great gift, God has given them a child. Stella, Don Ray, Stella, star dawn at the breaking of day. And I thought, how beautiful a name that is this morning. Because at the breaking of a new day, that bright morning star is going to shine. And I thought, Joel and Sister Kim, there was another woman in the Bible whose name meant star, and that was Esther. Esther didn't take the perfuming of the other women. She adorned herself with the modest apparel, the hidden man of the heart. The king would put the crown on her head. And that's what if God should terry that's what we want for this star for Stella that the king would put the crown on her head. Esther was a type of the church who was ready to come and adorn herself with the sweetness of the Holy Spirit. Not the perfuming and dressing of the world or try to compare with them. But she would adorn herself with that inner man. Naturally, parents want to give. They want to give, especially in this generation, things. But Joel and Kim, let her see Jesus. Let her see the gift of God within your life. That she could reflect then the Christ that you have. That her life would be a reflection both of Jesus and you. That's what we want. This little star to shine and reflect the lovely Lord Jesus and his grace. Amen. Lord, let the beauty of Jesus be not only seen but may it be reflected through this little bundle of life that you have blessed brother Joel and Sister Kim this little dedication morning. As your prophet said, the parents have come this morning to give back to God the gift that he gave them. And so I cradle in my arms, Lord, a little bundle of life. Her name is Stella Don Ray. God, may she reflect you at an early age. May she reflect the love of God, the grace of God, the mercies of God. May Lord God, she shine for the glory of God. Lord, every color of the covenant rainbow, may it be seen within her life. Would you crown her life, Lord, with health, strength, and the beauty, not of natural man, but the beauty of Christ. Bless this little child as brother Joel and sister Kim. Lord in this dedication morning give her back to you. May your hand ever rest upon her life. Bless her now in Jesus name. Amen. That is the first time she's looked at me and not cried. Amen. Was wondering if we should sing Joel's Army Comes in View, but we'll save that for maybe the third or fourth one, maybe. God bless you, Joel and Kim. Amen. Are you ready for the word this morning? Amen. Why don't we sing? We are standing on holy ground as we turn the service to our pastor. I'm [music] certainly looking forward to what we have this morning to hear from our Lord. Amen. Oh, we are standing. [music] Oh, a holy ground. [music] Oh, and I [singing] know that [music] there are angels all [singing] around. Oh, [music] [music and singing] Jesus. Now [music] we are standing in his [music] presence on holy ground. This morning we sing it again. Holy [singing] [music] sh [music] I [music] [singing] angels all around [music] and Praise [singing] Jesus. [music] Now we are standing [singing] [music] in his presence. [music] You're standing and we [singing] are [music] a holy ground and I know [music] might [music] [music] be our second [music] [music] Amen. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wonderful to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; And uh I I'm going to also have you stand with me if you would. I want to sing God rich in mercy. And I don't want you to sing it because the song leader is singing it or because I asked to sing it. I want you to sing it either for yourself, sing it for someone who's next to you, sing it for someone who's on the internet, sing it to the Lord. You are rich in mercy. [music] What would we do without that? And you may not feel such an urgent need of it at this moment, but he's worthy of all the praise. He's certainly worthy. And I just felt I I would like to say that to [music] you. Sing it for somebody. Sing it not because it's a chorus that we sung before, but sing it because it's the [music] truth of God's word. Hallelujah. God [music] rich in mercy. God rich in grace. Hallelujah. Gave us his son. Hallelujah. [music] All right, we'll sing it together just before we read. God rich in mercy. [music] We were undone. God rich in mercy. Oh [music] God in praise, God rich in love and [music] he from heaven to all [music] in mercy. [music] God is in mercy. Everyone once again. [music] Oh, God is mercy. God is [music] mercy. [music] God is in mercy. Hallelujah. [music] God is in praise. God is in love. Christmas from heaven [music] to all [music] mercy. [music] You are rich in mercy. And all of you say, "Praise the Lord." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We'll just have a word of prayer. Father, we're opening your word, but no one can open it but you. You're the only one that can give us understanding. You're the only one that can send the author, the Holy Spirit that inspired the prophets of old and inspired, [music] oh God, those that ascribe the life of Jesus Christ. You you uh you established you guided their pen. [music] You guided their thoughts. And now Lord, come I pray as you have given us a message in this hour that reveals our Lord Jesus Christ. Be revealed. Lord, be made known. I pray, oh father, if there's any here that are a stranger to you, I pray that even in this service, they will be introduced to the son of the living God, the lamb of God. I revealed in this tower. I pray Lord Jesus you'll give uh give inspiration to the speaker and to all that may hear in the name of Jesus and may that name be lifted up and glorified. [music] Amen. Amen. God bless you. You wish to take your Bibles. [music] I want to say we're for my part we're having a wonderful year. We've just started. Brother John Andes uh started with a youth convention in Belgium and we thought that was wonderful. Uh we had real good report uh from the from that also brother David Iverson had had written and they were so very very happy with the meetings at that time. Uh we're living in a wonderful time with a wonderful uh message &gt;&gt; where God has reconfirmed the promises &gt;&gt; to all of us. &gt;&gt; And it's and really we're here this morning and I'm praying that God will in inspire the word in such a way so that we will uh just be able to obtain and apprehend more of it. That's my desire. Tonight we're going to have a baptismal as as well. It's wonderful to see uh young people being baptized. Uh Ella Joy is going to be baptized tonight. And I'll tell you what, she's 10, I think, going on about 15 mentally. She knows exactly uh why she want to be baptized. She want to I asked her what meeting it was. It was starting at camp last year. Who was speaking? She told me who was speaking and then a second one was someone else speaking. Brother Tim Andes was speaking in in uh at the devotion at school and that spoke to her and she just can't wait. Just can't wait. It's been it's it's wonderful when someone month after month, you know, just right onto their parents all the time. They know exactly why they want to be baptized. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A group of our young people are planning to be going to Uganda for a working missions trip. I want to say to all of you, I don't know who all may be taking that trip. You want to be much in prayer. &gt;&gt; You want to say, "God, make me a blessing." &gt;&gt; And and cause my hands and my mind and my mouth to say what it ought to say and my hands to do what they ought to do and and and uh affect me. you can make one trip like that can affect you very very much. And so I pray that God will grant you. Brother uh brotherh Tim Dodd is going and brother Kim is going on behalf of the school and the young people. And so I believe that you'll be a blessing and we pray that you'll be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to take your Bible, please turn to Mark the 16th chapter. I'm going to begin reading at the 15th verse and then we have a second reading which will be Acts 26. Mark 16 starting at verse 15. And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned." And these signs shall follow them that believe in my name. Shall they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; So then, after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following. Acts the 26th chapter, please. Paul is telling of his conversion 30 years later after it happened and he's telling it to King Agria and he even gives goes goes gives more detail here than he does in Acts the 9th chapter when the conversion happened. And when we were all fallen to the earth, Paul speaking, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Excuse me. It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. But rise and stand up upon stand upon thy feet. For I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister, and a witness, both of these things which thou hast seen, and of the things which things in and which I will appear unto thee, delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee, and to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. Whereupon, O King Agria, I was not disobedient under the heavenly vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You may be seated. I'm glad you're all here this morning. I am desiring and I will not stop until we see uh atmosphere within the congregation atmosphere of expectation. We don't want to just preach sermons. &gt;&gt; We want you to be able to receive what that what that benefit is, what it's spoken of. If it speaks of salvation, we want people delivered &gt;&gt; and born again. &gt;&gt; We got young people. We talk often about the young people, but there's many others in the church besides that. We want to see the our children and your children. We want to see them come to a knowledge of faith in Jesus Christ. And you are sitting here some no doubt this morning that you know in your heart you've not experienced that. You need to be not only born again but you need to be filled with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And so I don't put the so much the emphasis on what you have to do. I want you and your heart, this whole congregation to pray that the minister who stands behind the pullpit will be so directed of God to to create the atmosphere, &gt;&gt; the atmosphere in worship. I hear the prophet of God often when he comes to the end of a service he will he will even though he wasn't the world's best singer but he would sing songs and and and and invite the people to believe and uh uh I'm telling you even now perhaps a ahead of time but I believe that if there are those that are sick and we have those that are sick and afflicted from time to time friends this word is either true or untrue. &gt;&gt; And the truth of this word is that if we should pray and believe and speak the word that will inspire faith, you shall be healed. &gt;&gt; That is God's word. &gt;&gt; And we want to see that happen. If we need to lay hands on the sick, if we need to have a prayer line, we will do that and see that people are delivered and healed. We don't want to come to church to just become intellectually uh more aware of the message. We want to come to church to see this message living in the people. &gt;&gt; And that is what's very much on my heart. I I believe that that is exactly what we should be seeing. I want to uh I want to take from these scriptures and speak on uh I spoke another message almost the same title but I didn't even realize it until I was well into this service and I had intended on a completely different subject but God just kept in indexing me over the last two three weeks and I want to speak on the vision of the great commission and how we need to be absorbed &gt;&gt; in that vision. We need we need and when I say absorbed that is to become captivated. I tell you, you know, a person that doesn't have a vision in the world uh probably won't get very far. Might be, you know, quite aimless. But in one of the things that we seek to do with our youth and children and young people is to uh uh to encourage them in a certain direction and to get them focused. And then it's one thing to get focused but it's it's even more difficult to stay focused because we tend to become distracted or when we are focused on something it we'll run into obstacles or we'll run into difficulties and then we we tend to get distracted because uh we ran into we expect obstacles we expect hard times but that doesn't mean we give up &gt;&gt; we continue and pursue on. And I can see in the scripture and we the scripture which we also read and concluded with where apostle Paul says whereupon I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. 30 years later 30 years later he still was onto his commission. And I think of a couple of others just briefly to start. I think of Abraham. He was literally commissioned when he was told you will have a son and his and he's bar his wife is barren and he's not able to give uh uh seed to his wife that will produce a son but I'm going to give you a son and and and this son is going to inherit this land and and and that remained his vision &gt;&gt; and he was he was obsessed with it even many years later he said I DON'T HAVE A SON TO INHERIT these things. All I have is my servant and you said you'll give me a son. That remained his the vision of his commission because he I believe he received as a commission I'm going to have this son. I think of Moses and the prophet how he spoke about when Moses came to the burning bush. The burning bush had what Moses lacked. And I can say to this congregation and all who will hear my voice, the message, the revelation of Jesus Christ has what this generation lacks. That's why God sent it. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to sit here and simply, you know, have a have a church service. We want to be absorbing, &gt;&gt; absorbing, becoming captivated, fixated, becoming uh absolutely obsessed &gt;&gt; with what this message came for. &gt;&gt; And the the objective of this message is to take a group of people beyond &gt;&gt; the power of darkness and death &gt;&gt; and to give us eternal life. That's the objective of this message. And I want to say in in the face of every demon of hell that shall take place &gt;&gt; and we are part of that calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham's commission, Moses, I think of Moses commission, and I'm not going to stay on those very long because I have a good uh amount that I want to cover. But even after Moses, there was uh Joshua and the prophets and then the apostles, the early church, the messengers. Friends, this gospel that we have received that we're so thankful. I'm so thankful that the messenger this hour didn't compromise. &gt;&gt; What if he would have accepted money, for example? What if he would have accepted popularity? You talk about someone who could have had it. He could have had all of that. But he would not compromise. He stayed true. And even when people begin to misunderstand and make accusations, he stayed absolutely true to his calling right from the beginning and years later. And and that to me is preaching the gospel to every creature. &gt;&gt; Living the gospel. We may not be a preacher behind a pulpit but we are living a gospel. So I want to come to one one of the earlier messages and he reads this uh same scriptures and he says this message that was read to us this morning we would call it the great commission for it was the last commission our Lord gave his disciples to go into all world and to preach this glorious gospel. good tidings of the resurrection to all the world for a witness and then he would return and and that signs and wonders would accompany this message that was to be preached. &gt;&gt; Preaching is not just vocalizing. &gt;&gt; Preaching is not just saying some words. Preaching is a life that is lived. &gt;&gt; Preaching is a life that is lived. you are preaching. &gt;&gt; You preached this last week. &gt;&gt; You may be preached to others that I will never speak to or these other ministers will never speak to, but you preached to them because the prophet said very, very clearly and I want you to stay very attentive this morning. I have a distance to go. He said that preaching is demonstrating. demonstrating is actually presenting something that's physically lived out. That's preaching. &gt;&gt; Preaching the gospel. You we might say, well, there signs and wonders and all of these things and healings and so on that accompanies it. But the main the main power is that you have been changed from a person of darkness to a person of light. You have become the children of light &gt;&gt; and not of the night but of the day. &gt;&gt; That is the gospel. And the very fact that you live every day and you walk the streets and you're in the stores and wherever more and you may think, "Oh, if I could only speak, you are speaking louder than words." &gt;&gt; YOUR LIFE IS DECLARING IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ALSO, when God's provided healing for this generation, he said, "Every time a revival breaks out, any time in the Bible history or in the world's history, signs and wonders have accompanied the revival, God is in the camp." I I want to say if if this were some of my last words to this congregation, we should never come here to church without expectation of something to happen in the service. &gt;&gt; Every service, every service, WE SHOULD SEE THE HAND OF GOD. GOD IS IN THE CAMP. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And when there's illness, WHEN THERE'S TROUBLE, WHEN THERE'S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR OTHER KINDS OF DIFFICULTIES, GOD IS IN THE CAMP. &gt;&gt; And for those that know that they have need of a deliverance, don't come expecting to walk out with it month in and month out. Expect to be delivered from it. &gt;&gt; But one of the most important things is when you have a spiritual need, and it is so IN THE SCRIPTURE. PEOPLE ASK SOMETIME WHY WE DON'T SEE you know signs and wonders and miracles so often because the people have not reached the point of desperation where they acknowledge even people I think of the the the man the de uh the demonpossessed one in the in the garden in the gatherines and Jesus said what is your name I'm just stepping ahead for just a moment what is your name said legion legion which is a thousand here's one I don't know whether he had a thousand demons or whatever but he was a wild madman oh amongst the tombs but God gave him sufficient reprieve to cry out &gt;&gt; to Jesus &gt;&gt; he gave him sufficient space AND THERE'S PEOPLE I FIND SO MANY PEOPLE are bound by one thing or another and maybe complexes or even hey there's nobody here that is immune to demon activity. &gt;&gt; It comes and bothers you. It comes and torments in your mind. IT TORMENTS SOME PEOPLE IN THEIR SLEEP. IT TORMENTS PEOPLE and he is a tormentor. AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE FEAR. SOME PEOPLE ARE BOUND WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS. YOU NEED TO BE FREE FROM THAT. And don't come to church packing it and go out expecting to pack it. YOU NEED TO BE FREE FROM THAT. HALLELUJAH. And when WE COME TO CHURCH, WE JUST SAY, "I'M SATAN HAS BEEN ON MY CASE THIS THIS WEEK. I'M COMING TO CHURCH AND I'M IN EXPECTATION. Either the preacher IS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PRAY A PRAYER THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT, BUT GOD IS GOING TO WORK IN HIS BODY AND I'M GOING TO WALK OUT A FREE PERSON." AND THEN YOU START SEEING SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE PEOPLE COME WITH FAITH. THEY COME WITH EXPECTATION AND GOD WILL PULL IT OUT OF THE PREACHER. GOD WILL PULL IT OUT OF SOMEBODY WHO'S PRAYING. AND THEN YOU HAVE AND THEN YOU COME TO A SERVICE AND YOU CAN REJOICE AT THE NEXT MEETING. YOU SING DIFFERENT. YOU SAY, "GOD RICH IN MERCY. HALLELUJAH. I JUST GOT DELIVERED. GLORY TO GOD. This is A DIFFERENT MEETING. GOD'S IN THE CAMP. DON'T FORGET THAT, FRIENDS. THAT'S WHAT THIS CHURCH IS HERE FOR. THAT'S WHAT THE BUILDING is built for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Then opened he their understanding." This was after the resurrection. Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And Apostle Paul said, "For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance as as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake." So the gospel must come to you. It should it should give you uh such assurance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you don't even have to you don't have to psych YOURSELF UP. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T have to try to build yourself up. You will be YOU'LL BE INSPIRED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow, not next week, this week, this day, this service. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't if you just expect a a good service, that's what you get. But if you expect something to penetrate you and do something and build you up in the most holy faith and not and maybe not just for yourself, it might be for your family. It might be for someone else. It might be from a husband to a wife or a wife to her husband or whatever more or to affect uh I was thinking very much of the of the school and the and uh the right from looking for brother Terry the right from the principal and down through the teachers. YOU KNOW WHY THE SCHOOL is built? We didn't build a building to have a nice school for you students. We build a building so that you could be in an atmosphere and have Holy Ghost teachers and and COME OUT OF THERE, COME OUT of that school, young men AND YOUNG WOMEN WHO CONTINUE TO PREACH THE GOSPEL IN THEIR lives changed, transformed young men and women full of the Holy Ghost WHO PREACH THE GOSPEL EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; AND THIS GOSPEL IS WITH POWER. &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS POWER. THE FIRST GOSPEL, THE FIRST THING YOU EXPERIENCE IS POWER TO CHANGE YOU FROM AN ordinary average PERSON INTO ONE FULL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT IS PREACHING AS YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET. PREACHING WHEN YOU go into the mall to shop. YOU'RE PREACHING ALL THE TIME. YOUR LIFE IS PREACHING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power for the kingdom of God. So the preaching of the word is the manifestation of the power of God. And that manifestation don't think it's now just you know praying for the sick and that kind of thing because that was the beginning. Uh I I will get to it in just a few moments. And the life of Jesus Christ was the very thoughts of God being lived out. &gt;&gt; The very the very life of Jesus, what he did and what he spoke was God's thoughts coming down to earth and being spoke and heard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the and I may be asking for some participation in a moment. I'm expecting this service to be just somewhat different. And the angel speaking now announcing the birth of Jesus Christ. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, &gt;&gt; for he shall save his people from their sins. That's why he was called Jesus because even the word Jehovah's savior Jesus for. The reason he was called Jesus is for he shall save his people from their sins. The name of Jesus is spoken, I would say, hundreds of millions of times a day. &gt;&gt; But what God HEARS IS FOR HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS. &gt;&gt; AND A PROPHET COMES and says the only sin is unbelief. &gt;&gt; Only sin. That was the first sin. And that's still the only sin is unbelief. All these other things in the life you see that people are living, that's the attributes of unbelief. But there has to be a power to deliver us from unbelief. &gt;&gt; And when the name Jesus is spoken OR HEARD, GOD, ALL GOD KNOWS, HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM their sins. &gt;&gt; I want the congregation to say those words. He shall save his people from their sins. Once again, alto together. He shall save his people from their sins. Now, I'm going to ask you at different times when I say the name Jesus, YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM their sins." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO SAY IT. JESUS. &gt;&gt; He shall save his people from their sins. &gt;&gt; GOOD. THIS ISN'T the rosary. &gt;&gt; This is truth. &gt;&gt; HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM UNBELIEF. HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS. &gt;&gt; There were men who needed healing, blind men or lepers, AND THEY SAID, "JESUS, THE SON OF DAVID, GOD HEARS, AND HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM UNBELIEF, AND THEY WERE GIVEN FAITH TO BE DELIVERED AND RECEIVE THEIR SIGHT AND were healed from God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. BY THE NAME OF JESUS, HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS. You're going to hear me say it plenty of time, and I'm going to expect you to be saying it some of these times. And thou shalt save, thou shalt call his name Jesus. Every time that name is named or called a of God uh God hears a call, God hears for he knows what the meaning. The meaning came out of the mind of God sending an angel down and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus. And God's thought was he. This is my pool. This is my son. This is the instrument AND THROUGH HIM PEOPLE WILL COME TO BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THROUGH HIM I WILL TURN AROUND WHAT HAPPENED IN EDEN. AND THIS IS THE SECOND ADAM. HE SHALL NOT FALL LIKE THE FIRST ADAM. HE WILL NOT COMPROMISE. HE WILL NOT SURRENDER. AND HE WILL TAKE CAPTIVE THE FLESH AND TAKE IT TO THE CROSS AND RISE AGAIN OUT OF THE TOMB. HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY I START OUT TODAY. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR NEED MIGHT BE OR WHAT YOUR CONFLICT MIGHT BE OR WHAT YOUR PHYSICAL NEED MIGHT BE. HE'S GREATER THAN THAT. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER DOUBT YOU MIGHT HAVE. WELL, I'M YOUNG or I'm this or I'VE GOT OTHER I'VE GOT OTHER THINGS ON MY MIND. HE'S ABLE TO WASH THAT OUT. I'VE GOT SATAN BOTHERING ME WITH ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT SPIRITS AND ATTRACTIONS AND LUST AND WHATEVER MORE. HE'S STRONGER THAN THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO COME INTO THESE DOORS EXPECTING TO WALK OUT FREE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Whatever little feeling you might have, WHATEVER LITTLE ATTITUDE YOU MIGHT HAVE THAT'S NOT OF HIM, LET'S GET IT WASHED OUT. &gt;&gt; LET'S GET IT CLEANED OUT. HALLELUJAH. So we CAN COME INTO AN ATMOSPHERE. I tell you what, friends, when a when a when believers of this message come together in that kind of an attitude, IN THAT KIND OF AN ATMOSPHERE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SUPERNATURAL THINGS TAKING PLACE ON A DAILY BASIS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Whether a person recognizes it or not. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, his name is used in cursing." It works both ways. When it's used in cursing, the name still means the same. &gt;&gt; He shall save his people from their unbelief. HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SIN. AND PEOPLE ARE USING ALL KINDS OF DAMNABLE things and using the name of Jesus Christ. AND IT'S WALLING UP JUDGMENT against them. &gt;&gt; IN THE DAYS JESUS SAID, IN THE DAY WHEN THE SON of man will be revealed, it will be as it was in the days of Noah. And in the days of Noah, Noah was a preacher of righteousness, preached for 120 years. There was only eight people that believed unto going into the ark. And brother Brandham uses that example. THINK OF IT, FRIENDS. ONLY EIGHT. A MAN THAT WAS PERFECT in all of his ways as Noah was. And people didn't believe him. I wonder I wonder here if we could just ask ourselves the question. Would I be in or out? that we we as it was in the days of Noah SO SHALL IT BE IN THE DAYS and so there's two things that walled UP HERE TWO THINGS and brother Brandham says sin today HAS SO WALLED UP THIS WAS ACTUALLY WHAT I wanted to preach on and I'm just touching it and the and the people in THE DAYS OF NOAH they resisted they thought he was a madman THEY SAID THAT SCIENCE HAS PROVED THERE'S NO WATER UP THERE SCIENCE HAS PROVED THERE'S WHOLE CLOUD UP THERE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT SCIENCE PROVES. WHAT GOD SAYS TO HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; AND IT WILL HAPPEN EXACTLY. AND FURTHERMORE, IT'S NOT JUST THE SIGN. IT'S THE VOICE THAT COMES AFTER THE SIGN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT IS THE GOD THAT MANIFESTED HIMSELF AND WAS UNASHAMED TO STAND BESIDE THAT PROPHET OF GOD THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE LIFE FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END. AND HE COULD SAY NOT ONLY AT THE BEGINNING VERY EARLY IN HIS MINISTRY, BUT AT THE VERY END HE COULD SAY, "AND I WAS NOT DISOBEDIENT TO THE HEAVENLY VISION." &gt;&gt; AND I'M PREACHING THIS CONGREGATION WHO SAYS THAT THEY BELIEVE IN THAT MESSENGER. IT'S BEING PASSED OFF TO US. IT'S PASSED OFF TO YOU SO THAT YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SAY, "NEITHER WAS I disobedient to the heavenly vision. GOD SPOKE TO ME. GOD DEALT WITH ME AND I STAYED ON TRACK." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO ENERGIZE THE CONGREGATION BECAUSE SATAN IS WORKING HARD to derail you, TO GET YOUR MIND OCCUPIED WITH OTHER THINGS. Deny him. deny him in THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM UNBELIEF. IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SOON AS YOU ARE SAVED FROM UNBELIEF, YOU WILL receive what you have need of. That's this gospel. And a prophet of this message could say, "And I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision." &gt;&gt; HE STAYED ON TRACK, NOT FOR HIMSELF, FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; FOR YOU, for you, for you, for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HOW WE THANK GOD. HE STAYED ON TRACK. &gt;&gt; What a sin. Says unbelief. &gt;&gt; How many knows that unbelief IS SIN? HE SAID THAT'S THE ONLY sin there is &gt;&gt; is unbelief. He that believeth not is condemned &gt;&gt; already. So the great commission is sending out the witness and testimony of the power of the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's not just a sermon now. That's power that is present right beside you, closer to you. You got to change your thinking. SAYING, "I'M NOT HERE TO DISBELIEVE. I'M NOT HERE TO QUESTION. I'M NOT HERE TO ALLOW SOME OTHER THING TO DISTRACT ME. I'M HERE TO REMAIN VERY FOCUSED. I'M HERE TO REMAIN ABSORBED. I'M HERE TO REMAIN ABSOLUTELY compassionate about this focus." And why did the prophet come? I WILL TELL YOU just a little later and quote from him. To call out a bride. &gt;&gt; He came TO CALL YOU OUT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He came to take you in. &gt;&gt; HE CAME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AND THIS JESUS CHRIST IS WHO I'M PREACHING THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And he shall save his people FROM THEIR SINS. THAT'S WHY THE name came. &gt;&gt; For he shall save his people from unbelief and from their sin. Why? So then you can receive what you have need of. There's very few people today but what we have a need sitting in this service. &gt;&gt; And I'm PREACHING A SERVICE THAT YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU HAVE need of. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching A SERVICE THAT YOUR LIFE CAN BE CHANGED PERMANENTLY. &gt;&gt; This is NOT A HIGH AND then tomorrow we are back where WE WERE. NOT AT ALL. &gt;&gt; JESUS. &gt;&gt; This Jesus THAT WAS REVEALED. THAT'S WHY SATAN is roaring the way that he is BECAUSE HE HATES THIS REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. THIS IS THE SON OF MAN THAT WAS REVEALED AGAIN. THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. HE'S THE SAME THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; And if YOU CAN JUST LET YOUR MIND LOOSE and cut ALL THE WORLD EARTHLY ANCHORS, you'll receive what you have need of. I'm not interested in a good service. I'm not interested in feeling good after I finish preaching. I'm interested in SEEING YOU RECEIVE WHAT you have need of. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE GOING TO BREAK THIS THING LOOSE, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; The demonstration and manifestation of the gospel is displayed in many, many different ways. It's displayed in the life of an individual. &gt;&gt; It's displayed within a church. &gt;&gt; It's displayed in signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And resurrection power. IT'S DISPLAYED IN MANY different ways. It's displayed always in simplicity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Where you think it's not being displayed and maybe you don't feel worthy or adequate, that's not the point. The point is what God has called you for a specific purpose and that is to manifest and show forth the power of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; For he shall save his people from their unbelief or from their sins. There were some men in Luke the 17th chapter and they said and they lifted up their voices. They weren't whispering. &gt;&gt; THEY LIFTED UP THEIR VOICES AND SAID, "JESUS, &gt;&gt; have mercy on us." &gt;&gt; And he gave them what THEY NEEDED. AND GOD HEARD, "AND HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE MY PEOPLE. AND HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR UNBELIEF." AND UNBELIEF VANISHED AT the name of Jesus, and they received what they should get. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU AND I THAT ARE SO FAMILIAR WITH THE NAME, AND WE'VE HEARD IT IN ALL KINDS OF RELIGION, AND WE'VE HEARD IT IN SONGS BY PEOPLE, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE'VE HEARD IT IN CURSING AND THEY'VE ONLY ARE WALLING UP. THEY'RE WALLING UP JUDGMENT. AND LISTEN FRIENDS, THEY'RE WALLING UP THE WATER. THE WATER THAT TOOK THE PEOPLE. AND THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND THEY KNEW NOT TILL THE FLOOD CAME AND CARRIED THEM ALL AWAY, BUT THEY WERE MOCKING THE MAN OF GOD." &gt;&gt; AND THEY WERE LEANING TOWARDS SCIENCE AND ALL OF their uh uh intelligence and whatever. bore and they knew not. AND THE WATER THAT CAME WAS LITERALLY THE MATERIAL SUBSTANCE OF THEIR REJECTION. &gt;&gt; Do I need to say that again? THEIR UNBELIEF PRODUCED THE WATER. &gt;&gt; THEIR UNBELIEF WALLED UP AND PRODUCED A FLOOD. &gt;&gt; AND THEIR UNBELIEF PRODUCED A FLOOD THAT TOOK NOAH TO A NEW WORLD. AND THE UNBELIEF OF THIS WORLD IS COMING WITH FIRE THIS TIME. AND THE FIRE IS GOING TO PURIFY EVERYTHING SO THAT YOU CAN RISE ABOVE THE JUDGMENT OF God and enter INTO A NEW WORLD. And that is more real than this world. THERE'LL BE NO CLEARCUT LOGGING ON THE OTHER SIDE. THERE'LL BE NO ALABAMA Alberta Aabascatar sands. There will be no oil polluting the oceans. THERE BE NOTHING IN THAT DIVINE PLACE. AND THE AUTHOR of this world has created a place for his ELECT AND FOR HIS CHILDREN WHO KNOW THE NAME OF JESUS AND RECEIVE JESUS CHRIST. FOR HE SHALL SAVE YOU FROM YOUR UNBELIEF SO YOU CAN REACH THAT PLACE. AND YOU'LL RISE ABOVE. WE MAY GET SICK AT WHAT WE HEAR in the world. We hear all this terrible demonic things, DASTARDLY THINGS THAT take place and it sickens our heart. Be encouraged. &gt;&gt; The flood that's GOING TO COME, &gt;&gt; THE FIRE THAT'S GOING TO COME GOING TO LIFT YOU RIGHT ABOVE IT BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE ARK OF YOUR FAITH. THAT ALSO WILL BE NOAH and his people as it was in the days of Noah. Noah and his people GOT INTO A PHYSICAL ARK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF HIS FAITH. HE PUT LEGS TO HIS FAITH. He put he used his muscles. He used his voice. HE USED HIS LIFE FOR 120 YEARS. DON'T LET ANY DON'T LET ANY DEVIL STOP YOU. Can you agree with me? &gt;&gt; Come on, young man. &gt;&gt; Rise. &gt;&gt; As Moses WOULD SAY, WHO STAND WITH ME? &gt;&gt; WHO WILL TAKE UP THIS CHARGE? WHO WILL TAKE UP THIS MANTLE? Who will live this life? WHO WILL DENY THIS ENEMY? HALLELUJAH. DENY HIM. THAT'S ALL THAT'S ALL THE PROPHET SAID TO A HOMOSEXUAL. DENY HIM. Deny him. AND YOU'LL GO HOME AND BE A REAL GENTLEMAN AND BE A REAL MAN. THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A SERMON. I SAID JUST A FEW WORDS. BUT IT WAS IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. YOU'LL BE A DIFFERENT PERSON. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my friends, THIS IS THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST. This is the gospel. &gt;&gt; And if you don't know this Jesus Christ as you ought to know him, YOU JUST SAY, "LORD, I WANT TO RECEIVE what that man is speaking about and not tomorrow, but today, today, this morning, I must receive it." &gt;&gt; I've asked him to come. I said, "Oh, God, I'm so homesick. I've seen these things happen. I'm not happy. I'm not I'm not satisfied just to get up and preach. I want to see the people receive it. &gt;&gt; I want to see them have what we're talking about. Not just reading about what the prophet did, but that what that prophet did is for the people now today." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You believe it's for you? Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it's greater than your problem. &gt;&gt; And you may not even realize you have a problem, but he needs to come and show you you have a problem. And then you need to call. &gt;&gt; You can't just sit THERE AND WAIT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU NEED TO CALL. &gt;&gt; JESUS, HAVE MERCY ON ME. &gt;&gt; I can tell you natural blindness is a lot less than spiritual blindness. So, I don't see I don't see things. I don't understand things. You're the one that needs to say, "Jesus, &gt;&gt; JESUS, FOR HE SHALL SAVE ME FROM MY UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; I'm not able TO HAVE THE FAITH and the strength yet." YOU NEED TO CALL out to him. &gt;&gt; So, I'm done with this. &gt;&gt; I'm done with this thing. I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE this enemy &gt;&gt; torment me anymore. Friends, we're not just talking about a message. People talk about the message pros and cons and all the rest of it. That message worked &gt;&gt; from the beginning to the end. &gt;&gt; THE SUPERNATURAL GOD WHO WAS Jesus Christ himself in the form of a filler of fire was there at every service and did not MANIFEST HIMSELF BUT IN ALMOST EVERY service from the beginning of the ministry TO THE VERY END of the ministry. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I was struggling and I really had a struggle with this message. It's not easy. But while I was while I was studying, I came across this quote and it was from San Jose, California, very early in the ministry. Sorry, 19 1959. Brother Brandham said pillar of fire said said this pillar of fire isn't any more than 6 in from me &gt;&gt; right at this time &gt;&gt; and he had a woman standing in front of him the first woman and he said to her he said I'm watching he said the pillar fire is not 6 in from me. That's not back then. That same pillar of fire is right. If if if the other things he said are true, that's not 6 in from you. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about history now. We're talking about today. Nothing more current. And we're talking about tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; If you have a hesit if you have a hesitation believing that, you need to say Jesus. &gt;&gt; JESUS. AND HEAR IT in the heavens that the Almighty God will say, "AND HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SIN. &gt;&gt; HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR UNBELIEF BECAUSE THEY NEED TO RECEIVE WHAT I HAVE SENT TO THEM IN THIS HOUR." And he said, "I'm watching the light between me and the woman, and now it's breaking away." &gt;&gt; And the woman suffers with TB. And she just come from a tubercular hospital. That's true. And there's somebody else. It's this boy here. Just a minute. There's the same spirit on him. Well, he said, "That's your grandson," says to the woman. "That's right. And he's got sinus trouble." But he said he had the same thing she had. And he's also got scar tissue on his lung. That is true. All right, Mrs. Harris, that's your name. You and your grandson go home. Your troubles are over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ makes you whole. &gt;&gt; I know a sister Harris has been coming. She's white-haired little lady coming to the meetings in Dallas, and I've talked about her grandsons. So, I thought of her. So I I just interrupted myself and I sent her an email very quickly and I just said to her, "Is that you? Were you in San Jose in Brother Ben's meeting? Was that you?" She wrote back. She said, "What a wonderful surprise to hear from you this morning." It was yesterday. No, this was not me. Brother Brandham was speaking to. It's a beautiful healing though. I have to tell you my story. So get ready. In 19 that's her just the way she is. In 1950 on gifts and callings or without repentance, you can hear brother Brandham speak to my daddy and daddy was healed of TV. Isn't that incredible? Same spirit. My daddy's name was Clifford Hearnsburgger. And you can hear them read it off of the card. The tape is not clear and on the and on the PDF it says sister, but that was my daddy he's speaking to. It is a long story as to know how we came to know about brother Brandham going to be in the meeting in Carlsbad, New Mexico. But no, it was ordered of God. My mom and I had just taken daddy to the VA hospital in Amarillo, Amarillo, Texas, a week before and they told us that he could not live more than two weeks. He was very ill. Anyway, brother Brandham told daddy he was healed and he lived for 14 years after that. I say in the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; he shall SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR unbelief in 2013. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In these meetings, AND YOU CAN ASSIST BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE AS A PREACHER OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, NOT IN WORD ONLY, BUT IN POWER AND IN DEMONSTRATION OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; That's why I said, "God, rich in mercy." If you don't sing it for yourself, sing it for the one next to you. You don't sing it for the one next to you. Sing it for somebody on the internet. Sing it for somebody you're going to MEET NEXT WEEK. GOD RICH IN MERCY IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S HOW HE GETS GLORY. &gt;&gt; We who know what his name is AND WHAT HIS NAME IS FOR. WE SPEAK HIS NAME BECAUSE WE EXPECT &gt;&gt; THE power to follow it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And she said, "I had been I had been ill for a long time and I could not have children." Now, this is Citra Harris speaking. I had been ill for a long time and could not have children. According to the doctors, Brother Brandham was going to be in Lubach, Texas. A few months after that, my daddy and mama took me to the meeting. I did not get a prayer card and we knew we had to leave on Wednesday night. I was so disappointed. But brother Brandham called a prayer line instead, and I was in it. As he prayed for me, I held in my heart my desire for children. In the next year, God gave me twin girls. My mama always said that he gave me a double portion. &gt;&gt; I had to leave out a lot of details, but this is enough to give God the glory and praise for his goodness to me. Hallelujah. We can say glory to God. However you wish to say it. He shall save his people from their unbelief. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, BROTHER VICTOR. HE'S GREATER THAN every need. &gt;&gt; WHO WANTS TO BELIEVE WITH ME? HE'S GREATER THAN MY NEED. &gt;&gt; HE'S GREATER THAN MY FRIENDS NEED. HE'S GREATER THAN THE SITUATION IN MY HOME, IN MY FAMILY, WITH MY CHILDREN. HALLELUJAH. SOME OF YOU YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE A NEW BIRTH. YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART I NEED TO BE BORN AGAIN. YOU WANT TO SAY YOU'RE THE ONE THAT OUGHT TO STAND UP AND SAY, "JESUS, HAVE MERCY ON ME." &gt;&gt; There's a LOT OF PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE whose minds are in darkness, but they HAVEN'T SAT IN THIS KIND OF A MEETING WITH THIS KIND OF AN ATMOSPHERE, WITH THIS KIND OF A PULL, WHICH I KNOW IT'S A PULL OF THE HOLY GHOST. You young people that go to the school, this is your my challenge to you. How I would thank God if I could have been in a school like that. HOW I WOULD THANK GOD IF I COULD HAVE HAD teachers like that. &gt;&gt; I mean it. &gt;&gt; I think about it all. I think about it often. &gt;&gt; I'm writing some of my memories and I think about it all the time. Cuz after right I was in a one room school. Grade 1 to grade 8. In another place I was in a one room school from grade 1 to grade 8. Had to walk four miles to school and four miles back. Go in the dark in the morning and come home in the dark in the evening. Tell you what, friends. But God had a plan. &gt;&gt; God had an agenda for THIS BOY. HALLELUJAH. GOD'S GOT AN AGENDA for you fellas. Amen. &gt;&gt; Will you say amen for me? &gt;&gt; God has an agenda for you. What about you boys here? You believe God has a PLAN FOR YOU? WHY DON'T YOU RAISE YOUR HAND? SAY, "God has a plan for me." Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Say with me, "Jesus." &gt;&gt; I can't hand that. &gt;&gt; Say it out loud. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Have mercy on me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, some of the young children that go to the baptismal tank, they've already had an experience with God, something that they will never forget. &gt;&gt; How many here have been baptized as children? Just as children, raise your hand high. You remember the day. &gt;&gt; You remember the time? &gt;&gt; I do. And I remember when I was rebaptized, I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Didn't know what that name meant to the same degree this morning. But it's a name of power. &gt;&gt; This is not a sermon. &gt;&gt; This is to get directly to your own heart and soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And to SEE WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS IN MIND. You want to agree with ME AND SAY, "HOLY SPIRIT, WHATEVER YOU HAVE IN your mind, ALMIGHTY GOD, BRING IT INTO EFFECT. &gt;&gt; HERE I AM." &gt;&gt; How many need healing that are in this building? &gt;&gt; How many need healing? &gt;&gt; How many need healing? &gt;&gt; So this this is not a show. THAT HEALING IS ALREADY PAID FOR. &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID IT IS FINISHED. AND WHEN HE SAID IT, IT IS YOUR SICKNESS, YOUR DISEASE, YOUR WEAKNESS, YOUR FRAILTY. IT IS FINISHED. I have paid the price. &gt;&gt; And it belongs to you. &gt;&gt; And if YOU NEED HANDS LAID ON YOU, WE'LL do so BECAUSE WE'RE INTENT THAT SATAN MUST LOOSE HIS HOLD. in invisible union. He said we all know that the modern church, now just notice as we take a little turn. We all know that the modern church in its present condition and its present state is in no condition. Listen close to finish the great commission that God gave the church. Now we're in 1964. We're many years down the road from when brother Brandham first said, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. Now he's announcing the church and its condition." Something friends, some of you kids, you young people, maybe your parents were in those churches when a prophet screaming out and they didn't even know it. My parents were raised up in Catholic church. &gt;&gt; And many parents here, how many here were in some other kind of church and you weren't, you couldn't you some kind of other religion? Let me see your hands. Look at how many hands you're wondering. Were you looking for something? &gt;&gt; Yes, of course you were looking for something. And while you're in that church, THIS PROPHET IS SAYING the church in its CONDITION CAN NEVER FINISH FINISH THE GREAT COMMISSION. &gt;&gt; AND NOW WHAT'S THE SECOND PART OF THAT? YOU AND I HAVE BEEN CALLED TO FINISH IT. &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN CALLED. YOU CAN FEEL IT IN YOURSELF. YOU CAN FEEL IT WITHIN YOU. SOMETHING'S MOVING BECAUSE YOU'RE CALLED TO FINISH THIS GREAT COMMISSION. &gt;&gt; I told you, brother Timothy, I had a second part. I couldn't get to it before. I was visiting with brother Timothy and brother Oed and their wives and families last night. We got talking just about spiritual things for a moment. Brother Timothy Anookco said you you spoke a message on the great commission, the vision of the great commission. He said that was very deep. I said that's my that's my title tomorrow morning. I that's my title. So I don't want to go there. you know, we get inspired and but it was so heavy on my heart and I already I was so I have never never ever just come to where I begin to think of what was in God's mind you know Jesus he maintained his vision all the way even when his dear disciples wanted to prevent him FROM GOING TO THE CROSS he said how then will the scripture be fulfilled Listen friends, this gospel didn't come to us cheap. It didn't come you know in a modern 20th uh 21st century such as we are here this world and the prophet said the pressure of THIS AGE IS SOFT living &gt;&gt; and and he said in a society that we're it's a neurotic society that we're not really meant for &gt;&gt; and that's why YOU FEEL ALL TWISTED UP WHEN you're amongst in the world but this is where YOU CAN BE AT PEACE. IS WHERE you can breathe in THE HEAVENLY ATMOSPHERE, THE HOLY SPIRIT. BREATHE IT IN. &gt;&gt; You say, "I I don't feel it." I don't care what you feel. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to get you to feel anything. I'm just getting you to believe it. I want to say humbly, I meet and shake hands with a lot of you young people, I want you to know I know what your need is. Maybe you don't want me to know other ministers when they shake your hand because the word is a very revealing word &gt;&gt; and you have it in you and you and it's you you don't say anything. You just shake hands. But I see that need and that's where the burden of the word of the Lord comes to. You don't want to see it just go on from one service to another to another, week in, week out, month in, month out. Because if that thing can takes control of your life, you find yourself outside of the company of the saints. That's the devil's plan. &gt;&gt; And I'm attacking that devil on the offensive this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm trying to get you all to agree with me, mothers, fathers, the whole congregation, plus everybody on the internet to agree THAT'S THE DEVIL'S PLAN. AND WE INTEND TO DESTROY IT. There's people perhaps not in this service this morning ought to be here. They needed to be here. And Satan's already robbed them by not being in the service. They needed to hear this. Finish up. Now we come home. Finish up. You are called. You have been called by this message to finish up &gt;&gt; the great commission. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word finish here where Jesus has used it, he said, "It is finished." And he hung his head and gave UP THE GHOST. THE LAST WORDS, &gt;&gt; "That God allowed to come from this vessel who he was dwelling in to reconcile the whole world to himself." The one was going to was now PAYING THE SUPREME PRICE FOR THE ENTIRE EARTH WHO WAS RECLAIMING IT. &gt;&gt; His last words, it is finished. &gt;&gt; And he hung his head and gave up the ghost. He died as men die. And they carried that body to the tomb, but it couldn't stay there. And the Bible says, if that same spirit &gt;&gt; which raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you, it shall also it shall also liberate. It shall also raise up this body &gt;&gt; by THE SPIRIT THAT DWELLS IN YOU. THIS MORTAL BODY, it shall raise it up. And we ARE CALLED TO FINISH. FINISH AND PROVE THAT THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S been spoken. And thus it shall be. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching, friends. I'm making some statements and then we'll soon be done, but I'm not done preaching. It was not so from the beginning. He said his last commission, the great commission to the church, go into all the world and preach the gospel. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. He that believeth not shall be damned, condemned, and these signs shall follow them that believe. He said, "Don't stop at the first equation or or quotation. You add and that's all." But he said, "It wasn't so from the beginning." Jesus said, "And these signs shall follow them that believe in my name." &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to change your entire life by using that name. &gt;&gt; I want you girls to use it. I want you families to use it. And when you use it, I want you to think of what was in God's mind. &gt;&gt; If there's anything in my way now, as I use that name, if there's anything if there's any hindrance, it was sent. YOU WILL CALL HIS name Jesus for he shall not he hopes he will NOT HE'LL TRY HE SHALL DELIVER HIS people from their unbelief from their sin from their hindrance. &gt;&gt; Don't forget this service. and in my name they shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, if a spirit from hell is hounding you &gt;&gt; and staying on your case and dragging you down &gt;&gt; and maybe not possession, but oppression, oppressed by it, &gt;&gt; I want to say to you, you are free in the name of Jesus Christ because I'm speaking to children of God. Hallelujah. And he shall SAVE HIS PEOPLE &gt;&gt; FROM THEIR unbelief &gt;&gt; so that YOU CAN BE FREE OF THAT THING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And they shall speak with new tongues. &gt;&gt; And if they take up serpents or drink any deadly thing, and you might say, well, deadly thing. Oh, you know, some somebody very foolish was drinking something uh poison. You drink poison almost every day. Contaminated things. and water and and whatever more. &gt;&gt; Some of this stuff's killing people. You might say, "Well, how do I know?" Well, they die the death. People die the death, &gt;&gt; and we don't know what took them. But there's some of you that are living that probably would have been dead by now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Peter. We're happy you're here in the house of God. just had an operation, heart bypass, and came right to the church right after that. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the way it was at the beginning. &gt;&gt; And may we ever remain true &gt;&gt; to the great commission." &gt;&gt; Oh, here he is now. He's about 1959. He's gone about 10 years into it. And may we ever be true. &gt;&gt; I want to say, brother Brandham, you're called of God. &gt;&gt; You've gone across your reward. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not it's not the man William Brandon that can be here but Jesus Christ can say where two or three are gathered. &gt;&gt; There I am. &gt;&gt; SAY THAT WITH ME. THERE I AM. Everybody say it. THERE I AM. IN THE MIDST OF THEM. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is between you and me. &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST IS BETWEEN you and THE NEXT PERSON. JESUS CHRIST. HE'S GREATER THAN YOUR DOUBT. &gt;&gt; He's greater THAN YOUR WEAKNESS. &gt;&gt; HE'S GREATER THAN THE THING THAT TORMENTS YOUR MIND. YOU MUST ACCEPT IT. YOU MUST BELIEVE IT. AND YOU MUST SAY, "I'M FINISHED WITH THIS GUY." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Holding the vision. I start out at the beginning trying to watch my time. I start out at the beginning saying getting focused &gt;&gt; is difficult &gt;&gt; but it's even more difficult to stay focused. Now he says now we're now he said we're further and holding the vision he said it's may we ever remain true to the great commission &gt;&gt; in the beginning of the commission brother Brandham 1949 now please listen to the language I'm not going this is not historical this is a this is a message you've been called under this why you're sitting here &gt;&gt; and I thought it was so nice the way he said now in these meetings I do not wish that anyone would be misinformed. &gt;&gt; I do not try to take the place of a medical doctor. This is not Mayo Clinic. &gt;&gt; This is the house of prayer. &gt;&gt; And incidentally, &gt;&gt; we're going to be opening up getting our rooms arranged and spoken with the brothers for prayer. And we want to have prayer. The prayer meeting is going to be different. Going to sing just a couple courses just to come into an atmosphere of prayer and then go right to prayer. &gt;&gt; And then when people are they don't have to have a a formal uh finishing or anything when you're done praying, you can get up and leave if you wish. And and that way you have prayer and a time of prayer. The church needs a time of prayer. And one of the night one night a month we'll have the prayer service on the US side so everyone can gather together and have prayer and that will be kind of the order of the service. Is that all right with everyone? &gt;&gt; And he said we're not Mayo Clinic. We're a house of prayer. When medical doctors he said when medical doctors God put them here they're doing a good job but medical doctors don't claim to heal you. They claim to assist nature and with operations and surgeries and with medical remedies which is an aid to nature but nature has to do the healing and God uh and and nature is God. God is nature. Now he says but now but now I hope you're listening close. I'm sure you are. But now the time has come. Now you hear something. NOW IS THE TIME has come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Until seemingly many things, the sickness is heaping on every side. &gt;&gt; And I wish to make this statement also that these things that I claim for praying for the sick, I do not claim to do one thing myself. I have no power within myself to do anything. I'm just a man, unlearned, uneducated, but but I'm sure that my testimony is right that truly a supernatural being &gt;&gt; came to me &gt;&gt; and made these statements &gt;&gt; AND I WAS NOT DISOBEDIENT TO THE HEAVENLY VISION. &gt;&gt; Aren't we gladise? You ought to turn your turn to somebody beside you &gt;&gt; and shake their hand. Say, I'm so glad that he wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision. &gt;&gt; And say that, &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad, brother Tom. So glad. So glad, brother John, our prophet wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's 1949. &gt;&gt; Now we come to 1965. Said just about 6 months after that, he was now he's rehearsing way back. And he said, "I had my first baptism." So he's re referring back to the first baptism down here on the on the river when the light came down right there at Spring Street and a voice came from it and said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ. Your message will forun the second coming OF CHRIST AND WE'RE CAUGHT IN THE MIDST OF THAT COMING. We're caught in the midst of that event. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "This is 30 years later." Isn't it amazing? It was 30 years later when Apostle Paul stood up, &gt;&gt; King Agria. &gt;&gt; I honor you AS A KING. &gt;&gt; BE IT KNOWN UNTO YOU &gt;&gt; that this HAPPENED TO ME 30 YEARS AGO. AND HE SAID BACK THEN, I WASN'T DISOBEDIENT to the heavenly vision. And now we HAVE A MESSENGER SAID I WASN'T DISOBEDIENT TO THE HEAVENLY VISION WHEN HE SAID YOUR MESSAGE WILL FORRUN THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST AND HE STARTED ON HIS WAY AND HE REMAINED FOCUSED focused focused the plane had trouble came down and in MEMPHIS HE JUST STAYED ON THE VISION I'm I'm I'm here to help the people and then he keeps walking that inner voice he told me about it just keep walking came to the edge of the sidewalk walk. Should he go this way, go that way? And he turned and he looked in the window of a story he told me. He said, "Just keep walking. Keep walking." He went back. There's a policeman. He just kept walking down the street. Got down to the poor end of town. There was a big heavy set colored woman leaning on the fence. She'd been there. Her clothes were damp from the morning dew. And he walks by her. She says, "Morning, Parson." He stopped. "Do you know me?" She said, "No." Said, "I don't know you." But she said, "You're supposed to be carrying a case. I saw you this morning in dream and you had a case." He said, "The case is back in the hotel." But I do have that case. Her son is dying. big tall young man dying on a bed going and she took him into the house. He said he never was in a place that he felt more of God. It was papered with newspapers and a little sign over the door. Now you have a prophet noticing what he notices. A little sign over the door said, "God bless our home." And here's this young man on a on a cot rolling back and forth. Oh, so dark in here. &gt;&gt; And she stood beside him. &gt;&gt; Great big tall young guy about 21 years old. And it said a tear rolled down her cheek and she patted him said, "Mama's boy." Brother Brandham said to me, "Love is stronger than death." &gt;&gt; Love is stronger than anything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he and Brother Brandon put his hands on the young man's feet. They were already cold. death had already started to move up his body. And he said to the woman, "Auntie, why don't you pray?" He said, "When she started to pray," he said, "I knew she had talked to him before." &gt;&gt; She just talked to him. She knew. And she began to pour out her heart and said that now God gave her this son &gt;&gt; and how he got amongst bad company &gt;&gt; and he got an incurable disease from the life that he was living. &gt;&gt; God healed and brought him back from the jaws of death. And years later, brother Brandham saw him. He was working with on a train as a conductor or a helper on the train. And he met him there. And the boy recognized him come running up to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it friends? &gt;&gt; This is the same you. We might say, "Oh, how wonderful that power is. The power that has changed you &gt;&gt; from darkness to light, from the world INTO THIS MESSAGE. THERE'S NO POWER LIKE THAT. THE CHURCH LONG AGO LOST THAT POWER. This isn't quit smoking or quit drinking or quit going to movies or quit this and not doing that on the internet or whatever more. It's more than that. IT CHANGES THE APPETITE. IT CHANGES THE MAN. IT CHANGES THE BOY. CHANGES THE GIRL OR THE WOMAN. YOU'RE CHANGED &gt;&gt; BY THE power of the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God, give me a voice. Oh, give me a voice. Amen. 30 years later and here I am still tonight proclaiming that message and around the world it's went. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, "I'm glad to be back in my hometown." And then he said at the end of that paragraph, "Now I have a message that I'm responsible for." When the message first started out, it was of course everybody was praying for the sick. Great signs and wonders and miracles that started, especially in the Pentecostal people, a universal revival of a healing campaigns that swept the world. For 15 solid years, there's been revival on every hill there is. And I suppose revival fires are burning. Literally millions, listen to this now. Literally millions have accepted Christ as their savior by that one commission. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I felt the call of God as a young man. But the message I have today is because of this one commission. Your message shall forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I mean? Are you following me? Are you saying are you saying brother Biscell that all these men that have preached &gt;&gt; and so on so forth then we got to confuse God &gt;&gt; the success and the ones that are being swept into the kingdom of God is because this event happened &gt;&gt; and your message shall forrun the second coming of Jesus Christ and it and that's the beginning of it &gt;&gt; he says and now it's hard to get in a church for sponsorship isn't Isn't that incredible? That kind of ministry and millions saved and revival started. He didn't only say that. Professor Harold says that. &gt;&gt; Professor Harold who flew here to Vancouver and I sat with him a whole day. He said the same thing. And he gave brother Brandham first place in the book and and a picture of the pillar of fire from Houston, the first place in the pictorial section called All Things Are Possible. Is it hard to get in church for sponsorship just as it was with our Lord Jesus? Cuz it's him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's simple, isn't it? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; I believe IT, TOO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I love I love these people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I love the people from Congo. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say, "Give us more. I see some of these brothers when they you you turn around and and and and they say, "Well, we're going to have prayer and somebody's going to pray." And you turn around and here you see the brothers and they're there like this &gt;&gt; to me. It's just a it's just a degree of respect. I saw them in Congo praying so earnestly and brother Deoka has to sing some songs to get them to stop praying. What are they praying for? They're praying with earnestness. &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to inspire this congregation, not to look upon these services like the last service. Say, I want I'm COMING INTO THESE DOORS WITH EXPECTATION IN MY HEART. And if Satan's been giving you a rough time, DON'T YOU DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING OUT OF THOSE DOORS UNTIL YOU'RE FREE. &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT A GOD THAT WORKS. GOD SPOKE THIS WORD. GOD SENT THIS MESSAGE AND HE DIDN'T SEND IT FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT. SEND IT FOR YOUR BENEFIT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Brother Carter, your wife's not well. Your wife is not well. She's home this day. And when you get home, may you find her better. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what this is all about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he sent his word and healed them. He says, "But he came." But there come a time where there's a message that always follows every sign because the sign has a voice. And Jesus said, "Can I have just a five more minutes or so?" And Jesus said, "I have glorified thee on the earth. I have finished the work &gt;&gt; which thou gavest me to do. &gt;&gt; I've completed. I've added anything that's wanting. Hello. Please don't weary on me. &gt;&gt; I'm getting a point across to you. Apostle Paul said, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision 30 years down the road." He's telling what happened at the beginning. Some of you can't go back 30 years down the road. You haven't got that kind of a history walking with God. But he's saying and it's in the word of God for our benefit. I've been I was focused. I stayed true for 30 years. Oh, King Agria. AND HE SAID, "DUST THOU BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION?" HE SAID, "I DUST THOU BELIEVE THE PROPHETS?" AND HE DIDN'T even give him a chance. He said, "I know that you believe. And King Agria with all of his royalty almost. Thou persuadeest me to become a Christian. And Apostle Paul, he wasn't finished. I would that you weren't almost, but altogether &gt;&gt; as I am, except for these bonds there. The prisoner was preaching to the king. Hallelujah. The prisoner The PRISONER WASN'T BOUND. THE KING WAS BOUND. THE PRISONER WASN'T BLIND. HE SAID, "I WISH YOU WERE LIKE ME. I WISH YOU COULD SEE WHAT I SEE. &gt;&gt; I WISH YOU WERE LIKE ME EXCEPT FOR THESE BONDS." &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WILLIAM BRAND 30, 40, 50 YEARS AGO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE JESUS CHRIST WHO SENT HIM. &gt;&gt; THE SAME ONE WHO SAID WHEN PAUL SAID, "WHO ART THOU, LORD?" SAID, "I'M JESUS." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'm Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let the people say, &gt;&gt; "For he shall save his people from their sins." &gt;&gt; What did he do? Do you get the connection? &gt;&gt; He said, "WHO ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; I'M JESUS." &gt;&gt; And out of the VERY MIND OF GOD, FOR I SHALL SAVE MY PEOPLE. I'LL CERTAINLY SAVE MY MESSENGER. &gt;&gt; I shall save my PEOPLE FROM THEIR UNBELIEF. AND THERE HE WAS, RELIGIOUS TO THE EYEBROWS, BUT FULL OF UNBELIEF. BUT JESUS CAME TO DELIVER HIM FROM HIS UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; I don't care how many years you've been. I don't care how how well you know the Bible or how well you know the message. He come to deliver us. &gt;&gt; And I don't see what I want to see in the services. I DON'T SEE WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD BE receiving in the services. And so I'm even asking God, is is there something wrong? Is there something wrong with me? or what? What is it? Give us a word. I prayed this morning. Give us the WORD THAT WILL BLAST ALL OF THIS UNBELIEF, ALL OF THESE THINGS out of our midst &gt;&gt; so the PEOPLE WILL COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD EXPECTING TO SEE GOD on the scene. &gt;&gt; We have needs. &gt;&gt; You have needs. You want to have confidence that when the people pray, they know the God in whom they serve. &gt;&gt; I've got to stop because I think I've wore you out. &gt;&gt; Wore you down. I should probably at least tell you this that when brother Vanom when they when God determined it was the time to take him into such an experience and such a the vision of the seven angels coming left him numb and he said I could see those angels angels and those shaped back wings traveling faster than sound could travel and they came from eternity in a split like a twinkling of an eye not enough to bat your eye or just a twinkle he says there he says I didn't have time to count and I believe in one message standing in the gap or one of the messages said it was five he thought it was five but he says here he didn't even have time to count he said I didn't have time no more than just to book. I was caught up into the pyramid of constellation. I thought, "Oh Lord, what does this vision mean?" &gt;&gt; Now he's asking, "What does this vision mean?" &gt;&gt; And I wondered and then it came to me, not a voice, just came to me. Oh, that is the angels of the Lord coming TO GIVE ME MY NEW COMMISSION. &gt;&gt; Praise God. NOT JUST TO TAKE A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD, BUT THE NEW COMMISSION. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS FROM THE OPENING OF THE SEALS FORWARD WAS A NEW COMMISSION BECAUSE NOW THE WORD JESUS CHRIST NOW HAD TO BE REVEALED. &gt;&gt; He had to be revealed AND SHOW WHO HE WAS to the people. &gt;&gt; And if you if you want to understand, you just take it from me if you haven't read it. Even from the seals forward, people get engrossed in the seals and and they, you know, it becomes so deb heavy and rather deep and so on so forth. But just remember the God has already spoken to him and told him this is a new commission. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's sufficient. I don't have time to take you all through it to finish the work. &gt;&gt; So he could say, I've been faithful. I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. I stayed true to it all the way through and in the end and from the vision from the seals. Now he has this vision then goes Arizona has a meeting of those angels and when he speaks the seals he says this this will cause 10,000 of my friends to leave me. &gt;&gt; And they did. &gt;&gt; BUT HE REMAINED FOCUSED. HE REMAINED ON COURSE BECAUSE THOSE WERE THE WORDS TO REVEAL JESUS CHRIST TO YOU. AND IF YOU SAY, "WELL, I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T REALLY GOT THAT EXPERIENCE." IT'S THERE HANGING THERE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; It's the SAME AS JESUS WALKING. HE WAS WALKING ALL THROUGH AND HE WAS WALKING. CAIAPHAS HAD ACCESS. ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE HAD ACCESS. THEY DIDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. THEY WENT TO the synagogue, sat there, listened to somebody speak, and didn't take advantage of it. Oh God, sometime we wonder if I could have only been there. If I only could have heard words. And today I talk to him. &gt;&gt; I talk to our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, I would love to just take him by the feet and hold him. I don't have that chance. THEY HAD THE CHANCE AND THEY MISSED IT. And people today say, "Oh, Brother Biscllow, you had such an opportunity with the prophet. You took him and so on. I was reading some of his letters last night." And uh he wrote one letter. He said, "Mom, I just died last week. My mom passed away last week." And I'd forgotten I had that letter. I was just reading it to the brothers. You might say, "Oh, Brother Red, but I didn't have that experience." you have a greater experience. &gt;&gt; Blessed are they &gt;&gt; that see not &gt;&gt; and yet believe. &gt;&gt; This Jesus, this Jesus that I'm speaking to about today, I'm giving a testimony. He can take a as it were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey kids, I maybe didn't have the home that to live in that you lived in. But he he'll take anybody. He'll take a girl living alone with her father cuz her mom has left and mom and dad are divorced. So you know what divorce is. This is dangerous for me because it goes out on the internet. But Sister Bisco come from a home with a divorce and was living alone with her dad from 12 years old. How many of you kids 12 years old? But one thing couldn't keep her out of church. Her dad didn't go to church. Her mom didn't go to church. Her brother didn't go to church. Her sister didn't go to church. Nobody encouraged her to go to church. That's where I met her. We were just two kids in church. But she wanted to be in church. Some of her earliest memories when she was about four or five years old sitting on the front bench of a little tent meeting. She doesn't know who's preaching. She wanted to be in church and sit there and and kicking her feet in the shavings. And then what I knew about her, I knew that, you know, she'd sing, had a beautiful voice and sing just as clear as a crystal. sing songs that had such depth and such meaning. And that was that's who you know as Sister Biscll today. But we didn't know that as as young people. But you know what we did do? Stayed focused. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We didn't even know. Nobody was telling us to stay focused. But we just there was nothing else. We got married quite young. She was 18 and I was 19, just shy of 20. But we and I just wrote it down last night. That's why I said we didn't have a home. So, we figured we probably could make a better home together than we could apart. So, we got married. Been 59 years in a in a little while. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say that's staying focused. &gt;&gt; Did you have any trouble? Lots. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't tell me you had any trouble. And we're two humans. That we have trouble. Not trouble trouble, but you know what I mean. She has her ideas and she has I want to get back. I want to bring it home to you. want to bring it home to the families. God's greater &gt;&gt; than the problem. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly Father, what is it you want to do at this moment? What is it you want to do? Is somebody ready? Oh God, they feel so urged. I want I want I want to show that I've given myself. I give myself I want to refocus. I've been out of touch. I've been out of focus. God has not really been one in my number one in my life. I want to I want to surrender myself now. I'm going to invite you while I'm praying. If you are here and you're not birthed by the power of God, I don't want to persuade you here with strong speaking, but I want the Holy Ghost. Come, oh, Holy Spirit. Come, oh Spirit of God, and speak to the individuals that are prepared to meet with you in a special way, that have a particular need, and they're here, oh God. Some may be sick and afflicted. We don't want to hear long stories about how things happened. We want to hear the great rejoicing about a God that comes on the scene &gt;&gt; and delivers people as we have seen you do, Lord, with signs and wonders. And we want to see people's lives changed. &gt;&gt; We do not want to see them just continue on as young people amongst the other young people. We want to see them transformed so that others see there's a power here. &gt;&gt; There's a power that's present. &gt;&gt; Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. [music] Let's just stand to our feet, shall we? I don't know how God has spoken to you, but I want you to obey the Lord. I want you to obey him. [music] And if you want prayer or need prayer, we've got ministering brethren here. And we don't need any history. We've had people just go by in a prayer line before. And God did that. Sister Jerry Harris that I just read her email. She came across the platform injured. [music] Injured in her legs and in her back and before she walked off, she was healed instantly. Friends, this is the kind of Jesus I'm talking about. And if you know within your heart that there's something different in this service, God is talking to me different, [music] then I think I don't need you to come forward. But if you feel that it would be good to have somebody pray with you, [music] then you I I'll welcome you to come. [music] Oh God, in the name of Jesus, let's just everyone bow our heads for a moment. Lord, I pray that you will finish the work as you would have it finished. Whoever it is that you may be speaking to, and if there's none, that would be fine. [music] If there are those, oh God, regardless of age, regardless of their situation, but they know that they just now need to allow faith to be released that they might receive from you, Father, in the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus Christ, get glory to yourself, get glory to your name. I wonder if the people would just begin to pray. Would you each one pray? Satan is waring right now and I'm not prepared to give in. [music] Satan is battling because he doesn't want he doesn't want there's some somebody's in a big struggle. You're in a big struggle right now. Why don't you just step out and say, "I am not going to allow this enemy to bind me and hold me back any longer. Whatever the cost, whatever it takes, Lord Jesus, I give myself to you. I surrender myself to you, my Lord Jesus. My Lord Jesus, just as it would please you, Lord. All we want to do is please you all that I am. All that I ever can be. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
