I'm going to ask the brethren if they would just come and prepare for the morning offering. We're going to open the service with a word of prayer. Want to read a testimony first from our sister Shannon Schmoutz. Saying this past Friday evening, her oldest daughter Hannah had complained of pain in her stomach and she prayed for her and she was up working on art projects within a short amount of time. But then she was complaining of pain in her lower right abdomen that hurt to the touch. And she laid hands on on her and prayed once again. And her husband prayed as well as he worked. And as the evening progressed, the pain improved. And all day Saturday the pain grew less and less until it was entirely gone. Thank you Jesus for answered prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Sister Joy Hayes just asked that we would please have prayer for her niece. The doctors think she has a rare blood disorder similar to leukemia. She has test scheduled on Tuesday to determine. Amen. So if we could remember her and also our brother Kyle is at home sick and body. And sister Violet asking will we please remember brother David. He is in the hospital. that God would just use this situation to minister and speak to his heart. Amen. Why don't we sing that chorus? Jesus. Jesus. There's just something about that name. Amen. Brother Tim, would you come maybe just open the service for us as we sing this song? Oh Jesus. [Music] Jesus. Jesus. There's just something about that as we sing Jesus Jesus like the [Music] rain. [Music] Oh Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. [Music] and will all pass away. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall we just approach the Lord in prayer? Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. There is truly just something about that name as we utter those that word that name from our lips. But Lord, it's more than a name. There's many people that are using that name this morning in the wrong way. There's some Lord that are reciting it as though it's some kind of creed or form. But Lord, we thank you that as it was in the logos, it's not just the word expressed. It's the thought behind the word. And we thank you Lord that we can worship you in spirit and in truth. That we can know our God and that we can see exploits being done oh Lord amongst your people. And Lord we thank you for the testimony this morning of Sister Schmottz and many things Lord that you have done in our midst. We give glory to the name of Jesus Christ. We thank you Lord for this opportunity Lord. Even pondering your word this morning Lord I will enter your gates with thanksgiving. I will come with praise saying this is the day that the Lord has made. We will be glad and rejoice in it oh God. And we thank you Lord for the opportunity to rejoice together to feed on your word to enter into your presence together bringing our licks of fire uniting our hearts and our minds in one accord that the spirit of the living God might move amongst his people once again. Lord there's needs in this place. Lord there's burdens. There's ones that would have prayers that need answer, maybe unspoken requests. Lord, may you move amongst the congregation here on the internet, wherever it might be, Lord. And Lord, may you change the onslaught of the enemy and cause a great defeat to the kingdom of darkness and a great king, a great victory to the kingdom of light. We remember these prayer requests, oh God. Sister Joyy's niece, Lord, we ask for her. We don't know her estate spiritually, but Lord, you're the God of the whole earth. &gt;&gt; The earth is the Lord's in the fullness thereof. And so, Lord, may you come to her. May you deal with her heart and may you touch her mortal body. We're asking him as believing people. Also for sister for D, brother David this morning, sister Violet's husband. Lord, may you touch his heart and his body. Lord, may you go to him there in the hospital. You're you are a high priest that is touched by the feelings of our infirmities. Lord, you know what we go through. For you came to earth that you might go through what we go through. And Lord, you are touched by it and we commit it into your hands. And Father, as we turn to the word in a little bit, we just ask your blessing upon the word. Anoint our pastor. Aresh Lord. For we have heard enough through that gift that Lord ought to put us into rapturing cycles in our life. &gt;&gt; But Lord, once more, may you use the gift &gt;&gt; and may you touch our lives, taking us a little bit further, drawing us a little bit nearer to yourself. Bless brother Ryan as he leads us in worship and prepare as we prepare our hearts for the word this morning. And Lord, we are going to take up an offering. We want to commit it into your hands. We ask Lord that you'll receive it as we give it as a form of worship unto you Lord. We surrender it to you, asking you to bless it, increase it, use it for your glory. Lord, we commit all to you in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Maybe as they take up the offering, we could just sing the same God. [Music] And we'll start with the chorus. The same God who spoke to the woman at the well is the same God who wondered [Music] the raing red sea. He is the same God who's living in me. I look back on history. Oh, I look back on history. I see the mighty God unveil. Proving over and over that his word can never fail. But I can't keep on running on the last glory. He is the same God. [Music] Yes. The same God [Music] is the same God to raise to the same God. [Music] He is the same God to me. [Music] When the same God created all the heavens and all the earth came back Jesus and there was power in his word. Now in these last days I to see is the same God. [Music] For the same God to [Music] the same God to many to tell the same God [Music] Amen. We're going to sing the chorus again. I'm going to ask our sister Lois Oello if she would just come and prepare for her special. Amen. Just as we sing the chorus a couple more times. Oh, the same God to [Music] the same [Music] to God. [Music] He is the same God. [Music] Oh, the same God spoke to the world. He's the same God. Too many to tell. Sing heart raing. He say [Music] [Music] My Lord can do anything, anytime, anywhere. My Lord, he can do anything. He makes the lame to rise and walk, the blind to see, the deaf to hear. My Lord can do anything with him. [Music] To the 12 of disciples, Jesus said, "Behold, I go to the Father, but I shall come again. Then I'll abide in your hearts, and you'll abide in me. And then by that power you will do anything. My Lord can do anything. Anytime, anywhere. My Lord, he can do anything. He makes the lame to rise and walk, the blind to see, the deaf to hear. My Lord can do anything. [Music] He calmed the rageing storm with his words. Peace be still, my Jesus said. And that was all. He raised the dead Lazarus after four days in the grave. My Lord, my Lord, he can do anything. My Lord can do anything. Just anytime, anywhere. My Lord, he can do anything. He makes the lame to rise and walk, the blind to see, the deaf to hear. My Lord can do anything. And to the bride he says just believe. The word of power is given to her. In his name she now speaks and his will performs. And by his holy spirit she can do anything. My Lord can do anything. Anytime, anywhere. My Lord, he can do anything. [Music] He makes the lame to rise and walk. the blind to see, the deaf to hear. My Lord can do anything. [Music] And how my heart does rejoice now to know that one morning my Lord will speak and I'll be changed. Then he shall call the name of saints and from the grave they shall rise in the resurrection morning. My Lord will do anything. My Lord can do just anything. Anytime, anywhere. My Lord, he can do anything. He makes the lame to rise and walk, the blind to see, the deaf to hear. My Lord can do anything. Yes, my Lord, he can do anything. [Music] [Applause] Amen. I think that's a good confession to make. My God can do anything. Amen. And we're just going to invite our pastor to come deliver the word this morning. Amen. Why don't we just invite him to come to blessed assurance Jesus is mine. Oh, what a foretaste and glory divine. I said at the beginning of the service, but I think if we really think about all the words that we sing, it would change the atmosphere of our song services. Amen. So, why don't we just prepare our hearts now to receive the word as we sing this and our pastor comes. Blessed assures [Music] for Jesus is and all taste the glory. I sales [Music] of God. I'm born of his spirit and that's your story. Let's sing it out now. This is my story. This is my song. I'm praising my Sior [Music] all. This is my soul. This is my song. Praising my savior all day long. &gt;&gt; Perfect salvation. Perfect. &gt;&gt; Perfect sales [Music] of now on my side. [Music] Angels receive [Music] [Applause] [Music] my soul. This is my soul. Praising my savior all the day. This is my song. This is my song. I'm praising my savior. I love the third verse. All is at rest. perfect salation and all it has. I say I'm happy and watching and praying for [Music] his goodness and lost. My soul is my [Music] praising Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, this is my [Music] sing. [Music] This is my song. Praising my savior all day long. This is my soul. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. [Music] Amen. We want to say good morning to you and God bless you &gt;&gt; on this another day that the Lord has given us &gt;&gt; to be together to be around the word of God &gt;&gt; and to be able to be living in a time when he said he'd reveal himself &gt;&gt; certainly this hour. &gt;&gt; So we can expect that this morning. &gt;&gt; We can expect that he will reveal himself to us. say something to us. &gt;&gt; And uh I just trust that you may experience what I was experiencing about 3:00 this morning. Just just the no end. It's a it's a it's a bottomless sea of glory. Just go deeper and deeper and deeper till you feel separated from this world. &gt;&gt; It's just so wonderful. Happy to see you all here. And I pray that God will bless you. I was uh reading this prayer and uh brother Brandham was praying in the third Exodus message. I pray God that each one I know they will because it's your word and it can't fail. And may we be led to the tree of life that we might be a possessor of eternal life and see the hand of God and by the eyes of faith look beyond these shadows that we're walking in today. Amen. And and see the promise lying just ahead. Bless thy word this morning, Lord. these few scriptures and notes that I've uh I've got written down. And may the Holy Spirit come now as I dedicate myself to circumcision of tongue and thought and mind. And the church dedicates their ears to understanding their hearts and all of us together that you'd speak to us through thy word. For thy word is truth. &gt;&gt; In the name of the word Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus said, "Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. and forgive us our debts &gt;&gt; as we forgive our debtors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen. Dear heavenly father, we've read these glorious words, inspired words, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, and how you taught us to pray. We're not here to pray with a multitude of words, but to ask you to be present with us &gt;&gt; and to circumcise as your prophet has said. &gt;&gt; Lord, I dedicate myself to you as I stand before these people. &gt;&gt; And before all of those that may be streaming today, I pray that you will bless them. Come into the room where they are, oh God. There are those that are needy. those as we heard this morning our brother David Law is in hospital. I pray father that you'll come into that room and may a mighty presence of God surround him and permeate him &gt;&gt; and give him oh God your thoughts. &gt;&gt; I ask oh God you will give each one of us your thoughts today. May we be inspired by the Holy Spirit. For your Holy Spirit indeed is present with us. And Lord, I pray that you will reveal yourself in your word as we read it, as we look upon it, as we ponder it, as we meditate. All of this will be in vain unless you are here present to do it, Lord. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to speak to you this morning on something I've been pondering for quite a long time. And uh the the subject is two worlds. &gt;&gt; We're in one here, physical one. And uh we have everything that you've experienced this last week and we'll continue to experience. But there's another world &gt;&gt; and I just wondered where that world is and and we will find from the messenger. So listen to closely now. The messenger God sent you &gt;&gt; stepped into another world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Unannounced &gt;&gt; unpredicted. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh without any fanfare &gt;&gt; and began to tell people their names, &gt;&gt; where they lived. He knows your name. &gt;&gt; He knows where you live. &gt;&gt; He knows all about you. &gt;&gt; He knows all about me. &gt;&gt; And I felt it's my responsibility this morning to tell you about that world. And we will find and I believe if we look &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; at the messenger God sent and allowed him access to that world ready immediate access back and forth and would tell us then we need to know uh for with full assurance &gt;&gt; that that world is just that close &gt;&gt; and the only thing that numbs us to it is this world &gt;&gt; and all of the things and so on. So we want to talk about that. I'll have you turn to uh the book of Acts, the first chapter, and we'll read the first seven verses. Then I'll let you have your seats, Acts 1. The former treatise have I made, O Theophilles, of all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he whom he had chosen, to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion, by many infallible proofs, being seen of them 40 days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which says he, you have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence." When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel. And he said unto them, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power. God bless you. You may have your seats. You'll need to follow very very closely and if you have a pencil you might want to make a note here or there. If you have a question, I'd be happy to address it. Not in this service, but later. And if I don't get done this morning, I will just uh close the service and then uh because brother John Andy's will be speaking tonight, brother Tom will be speaking in in Renton. So I would like to say after this uh reading of scripture having just experienced the resurrection &gt;&gt; the disciples, the apostles and the followers of Christ and uh that event which seemed uh uh so in incredible they the thing that was on their mind was the restoration of Israel. Are you going to restore? Is this the time? This event is so incredible. uh a man has raised from the dead. Our Lord Jesus Christ has raised from the dead. Surely he's going to restore the kingdom. That was the focus of their minds. &gt;&gt; We all have a focus. &gt;&gt; And it's it's on the conclusion of our faith. &gt;&gt; Where are we headed? &gt;&gt; And what we speak about of course which is which is only right is the rapture, the change of the body and the resurrection uh of those that are asleep in Christ. that is uh which is uh that is something that to miss that is unthinkable. &gt;&gt; And yet when I read some things that the prophet of God has spoken about it, it's it's almost frightening. So that very few &gt;&gt; very few &gt;&gt; will make the rapture. &gt;&gt; And so that's not to put any doubt in our minds or to cast any shadow, but it is to thrust you forward &gt;&gt; to say I cannot miss this. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if someone might just relax back and say, "Well, we're all predestinated. We're either in or we're out." Well, that shows for sure you're lacking something. &gt;&gt; Uh we're not to lean back just on on predestination. Say, "Well, I'm predestinated. I'm going to make it." That's the wrong way to begin with. That isn't predestination. predestination will uh thrust a person forward and say you know I must I must attain this as the apostle Paul said and so the scripture also says and I have many scriptures and and quotes and so you'll just follow along closely please because I've been going over this for a number of weeks in Romans 8:23 uh Paul is saying and not only they in fact as I want to read uh 22 as well. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body. There isn't anyone here but what has a groaning? &gt;&gt; This this world presents us with things that sets up a groaning within us. &gt;&gt; And we groan for two reasons. We groan because uh of of the thing we experience, the burdens that we experience. And we groan because that within us is declaring this should not be. Prophet said a tree, you know, a tree struggles because there's a place where a tree doesn't struggle. &gt;&gt; Flowers and so on and so forth. And men in life and women as well, uh, in life, we experience things that we know there's something within us that's saying this isn't the way it's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; This isn't the way it's supposed to happen. And there's something and and there's a a groaning and a travail that comes within. So I want to I want you to remember that as we as we move forward in the in the message. Now Moses and this is what I was thinking about early early this morning. Moses he looked upon the burdens of his brethren. Brother Brandham said that uh Pharaoh looked through the same window, &gt;&gt; right? But Moses looked to upon his brethren and uh he he he saw his brethren in with burdens and he was so burdened until he slew a man. &gt;&gt; Now I don't think anyone here has done that. I would say a person has to be really quite desperate at the injustice that you're looking upon. to be a God called prophet &gt;&gt; and to slay another man &gt;&gt; because of the injustice that he's seeing. You can't convince me &gt;&gt; that he wasn't terribly had some convictions. Uh even though he was in all the uh the beauty of and and educated in all the wisdom of Egypt and yet there's something that's not right. &gt;&gt; And there's something in him calling and saying that's not the way it's supposed to be. They're not supposed to be in slavery. They're not supposed to be in bondage. They're not supposed to be. And we have perhaps loved ones. &gt;&gt; We have perhaps immediate family or very close family and we we we are connected with them. And God has seen that we're connected one way or another. And so we are saying there's something within us that's saying this is not the way it's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that world &gt;&gt; that is generating that within you is very present. &gt;&gt; Amen. is very near. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Moses looked upon them burdened. He was already groaning but he could not identify that groaning. And then sometime later, many years later, he faced a burning bush. &gt;&gt; And in that burning bush, a voice said, "I'm the God of Abraham." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, he knew that was his forefathers. &gt;&gt; Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. This is his forefathers. And now he hears a supernatural voice identifying himself as being the God of his forefathers. So that's connected to me. &gt;&gt; Uh I can identify with that right away. Abraham is my forefather. &gt;&gt; Isaac's my forefather. And this one that is supernaturally speaking to me I can identify with. And now and now he's saying and and goes right to his groaning. Come on. &gt;&gt; I've come down to deliver them. &gt;&gt; I want you to go. &gt;&gt; So the God of the deep, we sing the song, there's a deep, deep calling. The prophet spoke on deep callth to the deep at the sound of thy water spouts and at the noise of thy water spouts. There isn't anyone here. That's why you come to church. That's why you're sitting here &gt;&gt; because there's a a groaning for something &gt;&gt; you're reaching out and maybe you can't even uh maybe you can't define it. &gt;&gt; Maybe you can't even say exactly what it is. &gt;&gt; Uh I've had people in my office and some perhaps even sitting here and they've said uh I feel that I need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And I said, well uh what will you be like when you get the Holy Ghost? I don't know. &gt;&gt; I said, 'Well, if you don't know what you'll be like when you get the Holy Ghost, how do you know you haven't got the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; And what what caused the doubter the question about the Holy Ghost? Because I can't baptize you with the Holy Ghost. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So, it's his that's his responsibility. But there's a deep call within us and I I want to deal with that this morning because ultimately the focus of that deep call is I I must attain &gt;&gt; the rapture. &gt;&gt; I I believe that God has sent &gt;&gt; this message &gt;&gt; as a call &gt;&gt; to that rapture. And uh there's been such an unveiling of this word. &gt;&gt; And I must I must attain that. &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm living. That's why I'm here. That's why I pray. That's why I read the scripture. That's why I read the message. That's why I believe what I believe &gt;&gt; is for that one single purpose that I will attain the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's our focus. So there's a deep call. And I want to say to you today and especially perhaps to the young people, this God that set up that groaning or set up that call, he's the God of that call. &gt;&gt; He's the God of that groaning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the God of that groaning. &gt;&gt; And he'll identify himself. Yes. &gt;&gt; Then you'll know where it came from and you can identify with it. &gt;&gt; U things that are to be. Brother Brandham said, "This life holds all kinds of evils. So therefore, the life that is to come won't have it." &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; This one has lust and sickness, death, &gt;&gt; because it's not the house that he's gone to prepare. Do you have some of that? &gt;&gt; Do you have sickness or anything like that or death? He said, "This is a pest house." And uh he was asking people if they know what a pest house is because they don't use that term today, but they used to when when there was contagious diseases, they'd put a sign on the on the door. It was a pest house. That's a house. He said that's uh well, that's where we're living. A pest is where they put people all the diseased people. Well, that's just what sin has done to us. &gt;&gt; Uh put us in an earthly pest house. &gt;&gt; This world is a pest house. &gt;&gt; Do I hear amen? &gt;&gt; This house is full of sin, sir, &gt;&gt; injustice, &gt;&gt; crime, &gt;&gt; violence. I read the other day where uh since the United Nations the United Nations that are to bring peace and have peace cores and so on. We have brother Hughes message here who's given his life and spent many years as as a peace corps uh from the Canadian in the Canadian military and because they want to have a reputation as peace uh givers and protection protection of peace and these nations have done very very much of that uh uh of the of the peace. However, there will not be any peace without the prince of peace. I believe we know that. &gt;&gt; But the United Nations since they were set up, there has been 240 wars. &gt;&gt; 240 wars and they set up. And they only mandated uh action on two. I think it was Vietnam and Korea. Only those two wars. Isn't that quite a record &gt;&gt; for the hundreds of billions of dollars that it cost to keep them going? And they got 200. They can't do anything with Syria. Can't seem to. They're just lame, limp, nothing there. Well, take it for what it's worth. That's not my record. That's what they've said. I'm not down on them, but I I certainly I'm not in support of that kind of a record. Well, I had 240 chances and I was successful on two of them and say hello and goodbye. There is a groaning. And now I'm going to I'm going to belabor this point for a moment because I know that it's very present. And you know, we come in and we hear services and we hear messages and we read the word and and we get a a sense and a feeling of, you know, I could conquer anything. And there's a feeling of rejoicing and ecstasy and there should be when we go out the doors and we you know come to reality of where we're at &gt;&gt; and what we struggle with and you know it seems that uh you know even here we get mentally prepared so that it doesn't exist out there but when we go out there we find it very real and there it is. And I want to deal with that. I want to make I want to make the the world of your groaning so real that that one will lose its its effect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So there's a groaning, there's a travail for another land, a world wherein dwells righteousness. Jesus said in John 16, "Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and if you you you that have been present during the last services that I've spoken from about Easter forward and uh it wouldn't wouldn't do you any harm to hear them again." &gt;&gt; And this happens to be on the way to Gethsemane. These words, I want you to put yourself there. You're on the way to Gethsemane. You don't really know what's happening. Things have changed in the message of that time. &gt;&gt; Seriously changed. The miracles seem to be gone. The power seems to be gone. &gt;&gt; The one you have followed and given everything to &gt;&gt; is acting very very different. and speaking very different. And so Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him. And he said unto them, "Do you inquire among yourselves?" Of that I said, "A little while and you shall see me. A little while and you shall not see me. And again, a little while and you shall see me." His next verse. Verily, verily, I say unto you that you shall weep and lament. Let's not shed a few tears. You will weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice, and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman when she's in travail &gt;&gt; hath sorrow because her hour is come. &gt;&gt; His hour had come. Their hour had come. &gt;&gt; And I want you to see something that's fairly I think fairly rich and deep. They were in the very midst of the blinding of their entire nation. Yes, &gt;&gt; they were coming into more light, &gt;&gt; more glorious light. &gt;&gt; They were experienced the greatest thing that ever happened. &gt;&gt; They didn't know it, but they were experiencing it. &gt;&gt; And the rapture is going to be something &gt;&gt; or is something that that the earth has not experienced. &gt;&gt; And if you're called by this message, if you have been called by this prophet voice to experience this, that in itself is unparalleled in the world. Very few are called. &gt;&gt; Very few attain that. But if you've been called to attain that, we should be pressing uh towards the mark of the the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus with everything that's within us. &gt;&gt; And he said, "A woman that's in travail has sorrow because her hour is come. But as soon as she is delivered of the child, she rememberth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world. And Jesus who was the son of man and my mind went quickly back and I don't know if I can uh uh succeed in having you follow me but uh the first man of promise was was se was Abraham. first man of promise. And that would have gone nowhere if he hadn't had a Sarah who by faith had strength to conceive. And she went into labor pains and brought forth Isaac. &gt;&gt; Isaac had Rebecca. She went into labor pains and brought forth. And the lineage continued on. And that lineage was building of the image of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then finally there was a young girl only she was virgin and she had been conceived of by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And she had a new creation, &gt;&gt; a seed within her, a new creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. With blood. &gt;&gt; Blood that was worthy to buy your soul. &gt;&gt; Blood that was worthy to deliver every man and woman. &gt;&gt; And she was carrying that. And the Bible says that they they went because all of the world should be taxed and she's great with child &gt;&gt; and she went into labor pains and brought forth a son. &gt;&gt; She had travail and brought forth a son. And the son was God in flesh. &gt;&gt; That would be God in flesh to the people. The word in flesh but it came through to travail. And now Jesus, the son of man in his uh earthly time and period, now he's coming to the end. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, you have to really pinch your mind now. Jesus said in Hebrews through Paul saying, "Behold, I and the children thou has given me." Now the second Adam &gt;&gt; was bringing forth a family &gt;&gt; hadn't taken a bride yet. &gt;&gt; She has another part to play. &gt;&gt; In this time and she will play it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She will be pregnantated &gt;&gt; by the word. The word which is here. She will be pregnantated by that word revealed. When it's revealed again, she'll be pregnantated and will receive that and will be hated by the world because of it &gt;&gt; and damned by the world &gt;&gt; and every nasty thing said about the message because they've come to another birth time, [Music] &gt;&gt; another travail time. &gt;&gt; The hour has come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it helps you to be able to place yourself in the scripture. &gt;&gt; And so understand now some of the words that I spoke earlier when the disciples wanted to free Christ, you will not go to death. He said these things must be. &gt;&gt; These things must be. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? These things must be. Say, I hear this. Hear that. These things must be. And you pay no attention to it whatsoever because the hour has come. This is the hour for these things because a manchild the son of David &gt;&gt; must come into existence &gt;&gt; and a sit upon the throne of David. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Ruth the gentile bride of Moabitis. &gt;&gt; Are you with me young ladies? &gt;&gt; With me folks? and Ruth, the gentile bride, taken by Boaz. &gt;&gt; You'll find it in the breach and redeemed, brought into a brought into the uh cycle of redemption. And she was caught in that. She had been married, but he couldn't he didn't have any seed to give her. He didn't have the seed of the kings in him. IMC didn't have it &gt;&gt; and her husband Mahalan, I believe it was, didn't have the seat of the kings. But then after a a period of drought, &gt;&gt; something within her must have been crying out and groaning, why was I born a Moabitete? &gt;&gt; Why wasn't I born into the house of Israel? But I will stay with Naomi. I will stay with what word we have. I will stay with it because that word held the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. And finally Boaz came on the scene. Who is this young maiden? This is Ruth the Moabitis. And from that time the messenger who introduced him passed off the scene and is no more remembered in the book. Not brought to uh not spoken of in the book again. And Boaz takes and redeems Ruth and Naomi and obtains Ruth and she receives his seed. And now the process, the cycle of the kings and produces Oed and he and has Jesse and Jesse has David. You see the eternal God, that world is eternal. &gt;&gt; He's not doing things in our timeline. He's not doing things in our schedule. [Music] You cannot put the timeless God into a box of time. &gt;&gt; This prophet, this prophet in our day, he was in the timeless realm in this realm. Speaking of the timeless realm, and men in their little minds think they're going to take this timeless God and fix it, say, "Well, it didn't happen that way. It wasn't on this day." God doesn't know anything about days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You understand what I say? How do you understand God when God says uh and and gives it to a vindicated prophet, you shall not make any graven image &gt;&gt; of any likeness of anything in heaven or on earth, you shall not make a graven image. And then gives them all the specifications for the temple of the tabernacle rather, and saying, I will dwell with the people. You make this tabernacle and in the most holy holy holy place you'll have an ark and over the ark you'll have a mercy seat and over the mercy seat you'll put two cherubams graven images of cherubams and you'll put it in the most holy place. &gt;&gt; Reconcile that for me &gt;&gt; or the Torah which is the only Bible they had. The only Bible they had said it's an abomination. absolutely blasphemy to eat human flesh or to drink blood or to have anything with blood in it. You must have it absolutely free. That's why we have the kosher kosher on all the packages in your department store if it's kosher. And they've got all kinds of things added to it. But my when when Rabbi Richmond was here, my wife had a we have a set of pots and pans and everything set aside and it doesn't touch anything else. It just cooks kosher food for the Orthodox people that we've had. Garrison Solomon, his wife, Rabbi Richmond each time. And we have those dishes and those things just set aside for that. And that's why they don't mind coming to our place. They love coming to our place because they know that we honor the the the kosher and buy the kosher things and so on so forth. But here the only Bible they have at the time of the scripture, the only Bible says absolute blasphemy. And you're going to believe in this. Man says, "Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no life in you." And just left it and walked away. &gt;&gt; Never went back and explained it. Never went back and said, "Well, I know it's hard to understand, but let me just give you a little bit more." He didn't do that. He said, "You either believe it or you don't believe him." [Applause] this man was vindicated by God. You believe it or you don't believe it. &gt;&gt; And if you go the direction I don't believe, then then that's the result you get. &gt;&gt; And I think this congregation need to be a congregation of believers. &gt;&gt; And we believe the word the timeless God cannot be put into a a box of time. &gt;&gt; You can't take immortality and bring it down into the mindset of humans. He doesn't fit. [Music] &gt;&gt; And so now we begin, even if we even if we realize this morning, you know what? After this service, we walk out of here and say, you know what? I don't know anything. &gt;&gt; That's a plus. &gt;&gt; That's a plus. And then if God makes himself known, then you know something. &gt;&gt; Say, well, you know what? I heard something and it really set me thinking this morning. That's a That's a double plus. &gt;&gt; So Jesus knew and he said a woman when she's in travail because and I've been saying to you now and I want to repeat it again so you get it. They didn't have Easter &gt;&gt; when this was happening. &gt;&gt; They don't even know what that word means. &gt;&gt; Easter. &gt;&gt; Bunnies and eggs and stuff. has nothing to do with what was going on. This was a cruel &gt;&gt; uh judgment &gt;&gt; taking an innocent man &gt;&gt; and bringing him to the most cruel of deaths. &gt;&gt; But this was the travail that the church entered into &gt;&gt; with him because the son of man is trans being transformed. Shall I say the same God is coming into another office by way of a birth into the son of God &gt;&gt; and will be in a in a whole period of the New Testament era as son of God. &gt;&gt; Son of God. God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; So he wanted to reveal himself as a son of God. &gt;&gt; A son of a product of that spirit. That's why Mary was conceived of by the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; She produced a son of God. &gt;&gt; But he initially revealed himself because he was born of a woman. He revealed himself as a son of man &gt;&gt; and fulfilled the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. G. &gt;&gt; And then before he left, he said, "When you see the days again of Noah &gt;&gt; and you see the days of Sodom, &gt;&gt; then I then the in in such a time will the Son of Man be revealed again." In other words, there'll be another man &gt;&gt; who the son of man, the son of man reveal re will reveal himself through a son of man &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, I don't understand it." Well, believe it &gt;&gt; because that's exactly what the scripture is speaking about. And Apostle Paul says this in first 1 Thessalonians 4:15. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. And the people said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; We believe that. &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the first verse of the next chapter says, "But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you." And it goes on. So the subject I want to say, Apostle Paul now is setting forth that listen very very closely because this this has troubled scholars and you can read all kinds of it if you wanted to and I would suggest you don't bother yourself about it. But the Old Testament says very very little about the afterlife. In fact is the doctrine of the resurrection is not a doctrine in the of the Old Testament and I'm going to give you some statistics just now. It became a doctrine. So that which happened to Jesus Christ that was kind of strange to them. &gt;&gt; Yes. uh eternal life and I have this for you. Eternal life is used only in the New Testament. The term eternal life is only used in the New Testament 26 times. Life eternal is used only in the New Testament four times. So eternal life doesn't appear in the Old Testament. And life eternal doesn't appear in the Old Testament. Everlasting life is used once in the Old Testament and 10 times in the New Testament. Everlasting life, I believe it's used in Daniel once. And life everlasting is used only in the New Testament four times. So eternal life, life eternal, everlasting life and life everlasting is really not found in the Old Testament as a teaching. It's not found. In fact is some of the Jewish people go back and say it does not appear uh an afterlife does not appear in the Torah which is to them the five books of Moses. It's used elsewhere perhaps once. And Job said, you know, I know that my redeemer liveth and at the last day I'll stand upon the earth, etc. But it's not a doctrine by a messenger as Apostle Paul was. Now, Apostle Paul gives it very specific. &gt;&gt; There'll be a resurrection and the dead and those that are asleep will rise first. Then we which are alive and remain. There's no such a thing in the Old Testament. So, it was put yourself back, please, and understand it was very, very difficult. And and I don't want you to dwell on how difficult it was for the believers then. That's why there was such a bewilderment, you know, and and and the son of man will be killed and he'll be and he'll rise again. This isn't a doctrine. &gt;&gt; This isn't something they understood. &gt;&gt; And he'll rise again. &gt;&gt; So this is a complete bewilderment. But we are we are down here many many centuries later and have received the kind of message we have. There should be no mistake. There should be no error whatsoever in our mind that this is a teaching that God has established &gt;&gt; and God has confirmed &gt;&gt; from Jesus right on through. He's con confirmed this. So, we have to come to the conclusion there's a process of redemption &gt;&gt; and this is what's been happening. And here we are at the at the at the end of redemption. Now, listen, I'm I'm moving quickly and I'm jumping ahead of myself and then I'm going to come back to it. But uh the prophet says clearly that the Jews have gone back to their homeland &gt;&gt; for the day of atonement. &gt;&gt; We play a part in that &gt;&gt; because the Gentiles and that we we enter in at the at the closing of this era. We enter in there's a a rising Jesus said plainly that the world will hate you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not going to think you're the finest person &gt;&gt; in the staff &gt;&gt; or where you work. &gt;&gt; You're an oddball. &gt;&gt; You're an oddball. &gt;&gt; Accept it, folks. You're an oddball. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. &gt;&gt; And not well thought of. And then from even those from within, and I've been with ministers and so on and and I'm not troubled. I'm not troubled a bit. &gt;&gt; These things must be. &gt;&gt; It's here in the scripture. &gt;&gt; It's a travail. Does it is it is it a burdensome thing? Well, yes, there's some burden with it, but it's a glorious thing because a woman when she's in travail and he must pass from son of God to son of David. &gt;&gt; And that is why the prophet would say, "You're pregnantated." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you're sealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. The womb is sealed &gt;&gt; because God has given you that seed. [Music] &gt;&gt; And that seed can only produce what this word has written. This is God's seed. &gt;&gt; You've received this word. &gt;&gt; Have you followed me thus far? &gt;&gt; All right. But the times and seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you. And so now I've given you that the subject of the resurrection was not a wellestablished subject in the Old Testament and thus the disciples. But you know friends even though they couldn't understand it did that did that stop &gt;&gt; did that stop the church b being born? Did that stop the power of the Holy Spirit? No. That doesn't stop anything &gt;&gt; though we don't maybe understand every detail and you know as humans we like to understand I like to understand these things many times it's not given to us &gt;&gt; to understand as Jesus said to the apostles and the disciples &gt;&gt; so it's very important that we understand that the plan and purpose of God &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; in the unseen world &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; is being played out in this physical visible world. &gt;&gt; And this is where now where the rubber's going to hit the road. Jesus said, "If I've told you of earthly things and you believe not, how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. And he's standing there and those people, I want you to put yourself there around him. when he said that no man's ascended up to heaven &gt;&gt; except he that came from heaven &gt;&gt; even the son of man which is in heaven &gt;&gt; and he's standing there and say that again &gt;&gt; and you'd walk away from that and he wouldn't say it again or he wouldn't explain it &gt;&gt; and you'd have to go out saying you know what I don't really know anything I can't figure that out &gt;&gt; even the son of And I believe that he came from heaven. I believe he's the son of God. I believe he's the son of man. Whatever. And he says he came down from heaven. And the son of man that's in heaven. They say, "Well, I thought that this world was, you know, a world of trouble and famine and all of these things." But the unseen world is unfolding in the visible world. And in Mark he said this. And when the Sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing him were astonished and saying, From whence hath this man these things? That's the statement. From whence hath this man these things? So they could regard that he has these things. We're astonished at these things. But where did he get these things? &gt;&gt; And I say to, you know, if there was nothing to the message, the world wouldn't pay any attention to it. They say a bunch of people just off the wall. No, they know. They're astonished with these things. &gt;&gt; They're amazed at these things, but they can't figure out where did this man get these things. We hear these tapes or we hear these things and and if you look at it with the mind of I'm going to see where it aired. Well, if you looked at it and to see where Jesus aired, you would find lots of places that he aired according to your understanding. But the problem is you've got an eternal God. You're trying to put him in a box. You're trying to put him an immortal. He doesn't know anything about yesterday or tomorrow or anything. Incidentally, while I was away, and I mentioned this to a couple of the ministers, uh, how many here have heard of Stephen Hawking? &gt;&gt; A lot of you. Good. Stephen Hawking is the Einstein of yesterday &gt;&gt; and he's so brilliant. The fact is he was here in Vancouver and I went down and heard him and he speeched by a computer voice touching buttons and answered questions on the universe and things. I mean, just incredible. And I thought that was so And there he's all twisted up with that uh Garrick's disease, Legareric's disease. And I thought it was so amazing. But he said he said a a a child once asked him, "Dr. Hawkins, why can't we remember the future as well as we remember the past?" And and Stephven Hawkings put that in his book. He said, "I thought that was a very intelligent question." And I can tell by the silence. You don't think it's quite that intelligent, but we're not in the realm that Stephen Hawking is. We're not thinking where he is. He's got the time warps and everything else. But the prophet got into that also. He touched it. And did you did you know students that brother Brandham used the time time space or space time and he puts those two together that is absolutely a scientific term &gt;&gt; and then he talks about which also is this probably perhaps didn't come by some divine revelation but he said that you know they can travel and he said I think science says you can travel say for 300 years and when you would come back you're only 50 years older. even though you've been gone 300 years. Uh, can you figure that out? I can't figure that out. So, I'm here. I'm just saying, you know, I don't know anything. I really don't. So, I'm just saying it the way he said it. And Stephen Hawking said, you know, I thought that was very intelligent. Why can't we remember the future uh as well as we remember the past? And it meant a lot of sense to him. He thought that was a very intelligent question. So there it is. Now we're getting down to the meat of the subject. Jesus said Jesus rather the prophet said of Jesus Jesus lived in a world nobody knowed anything about. He said it is I'm in another world. &gt;&gt; I'm just taking phrases. &gt;&gt; I'm in another world and the two worlds that exist at the same time. Now we're talking about rapture. And he said, "A vision," and this is at thy word in 1953, he said, "A vision causes you to be in two worlds at the same time." So a vision caused that. He said, "You're in this world here now, yet you're in another world." He was describing it. He said, "You're speaking over there knowing that your voice is heard back here speaking of himself. You know that you're you're over there and you're speaking and yet you and you know that the voice is being heard here, but you're over there. Then after a while, it gets to a place you can tell. You can't tell whether you're over here or over here." &gt;&gt; Now, is is that real? Well, here here's a man, you know, &gt;&gt; here's a man that went to school. &gt;&gt; Here's a man that's married. Here's a man that's a father. &gt;&gt; And yet he stands here in front of the people and goes to some place &gt;&gt; while he's standing there. That place where there is no war. &gt;&gt; That place where there is no violence. &gt;&gt; That place that is a place of absolute knowledge and wisdom &gt;&gt; and comes back here and then people sit here with little peanut brains and try to figure out what he said. &gt;&gt; How can you figure out what he said when you don't even know where he was? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Am I making some headway? &gt;&gt; All right. He said, "I don't even know where I'm at half the time." &gt;&gt; And then in another message, God's God commissioning Moses, he said, "You don't realize, friend, what a strain. &gt;&gt; You're living in two worlds at the same time. But the angel of the Lord that you see on this picture is here now. &gt;&gt; So being in that realm, he knows that that angel is here now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And every spirit, notice now what happens. He just steps into absolute authority. And every spirit here in the building is subject to me by Jesus Christ at this time. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where do you get that kind of &gt;&gt; authority? In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I take possession &gt;&gt; of every spirit in this building. &gt;&gt; That's like taking ownership. &gt;&gt; And sir, as we would see Jesus, it's anointing and it makes me feel different from than what I really am and read your life cuz you're in a dual condition. &gt;&gt; You're in the two worlds at the same time. Amen. &gt;&gt; This world cannot be understood with the natural mind. I'm going into perfect faith now. The message perfect faith. But Jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about. &gt;&gt; He was an odd person. &gt;&gt; He lived in a world of perfect faith &gt;&gt; in the in the perfect God in which he was. &gt;&gt; If we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are, we'd be a mystic to the world. &gt;&gt; The people wouldn't understand you. Now you're coming to He's inferring &gt;&gt; please your full attention. &gt;&gt; He's inferring that this is for you. &gt;&gt; He's inferring there's a realm of the God of this message &gt;&gt; that wants you to participate. &gt;&gt; Amen. and to become into such a realm that God can uh speak to you and show you things that cause you to be I don't want anybody to get any wild ideas this off-the-wall stuff. Brother Brandham lived a very very natural life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said you'd be a mystic to the world and the people wouldn't understand you. Well, they don't understand you now, do they? So, is that a result of this world &gt;&gt; or a result of the college you went to &gt;&gt; or a result of the high school you graduated from? &gt;&gt; Or is that a result of where you work? &gt;&gt; Or is that a result of what you've heard &gt;&gt; through this word &gt;&gt; that has made you so the world doesn't understand you. &gt;&gt; You'd walk in the spirit and what the spirit said you would do. what it forbid you to you would not do. Then the people begin to say and you'd be a mystic person to them. &gt;&gt; He said that's the way it is to all believers. They're a mystic. The people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves. &gt;&gt; Jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch. The disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them. Then they then uh they say this and then they said why you walk why are you talking riddles we don't understand this how can this be see they wasn't in the world that he lived in that's the problem when it sounds like a riddle then you say I'm not in the world that that speaker is in I'm not in the world where that statement originated &gt;&gt; God take me into that realm Give me an understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh God," I'm not just preaching. I'm saying, "Oh God, grant that to this people." That's what this church stands for. That's what this church exists for. That's what this church was established on. Oh God, give us a mind that understands what seems like a riddle to the world. &gt;&gt; You'll never learn it in the encyclopedia. You'll never learn it in the college or your school. You'll never learn it. That That's why I thank God for the school that we have. So that the atmosphere is there. It's conducive to supernatural things. And you young men and young ladies, you thank God. Oh God, you provided people. You provided teachers. You provided ministry. You provided us with a burden in a vision. And it's my it's my grand privilege to carry this on. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's another world. And the reason why I'm I know I've I know you may say in your mind, well, why do you say it, you know, more times when two or three times? Because there's different things, different aspects that are said. And while I'm while I'm speaking, I want you to know that world is right here. &gt;&gt; That world is very present. &gt;&gt; That world is more real than the one you're in. &gt;&gt; Sitting in a physical state in a physical body. You say, "Well, that seems to get off into almost like a mystic realm." It is. It is &gt;&gt; it's a realm that God, your brain needs the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to come down and illuminate you with divine light. &gt;&gt; And there's another reason why I want to, and I'll I'll bring this out. You're living in two worlds. When he says you're, he's speaking of himself most of the time. You're living in two worlds at the same time. You're in a dimension that the world knows nothing about. The world knows nothing about this dimension. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; And there's no way to explain it. Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; There's no way to explain it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's another world. And that's why I wouldn't even venture to explain it. &gt;&gt; It's to be believed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And did you know uh do you now believe in Owens ownsboro, Kentucky, he said it's another world like two worlds. You break over into this world and this world and you stay you stay in it too long you hardly know just now. He said when leaving the platform when it comes on I feel like oh I was up in the heavens but when it's off of me I feel good but in between those times. So there is an in between those times. &gt;&gt; It seems like you're just stepping off the world. &gt;&gt; No need in me trying to explain it. You can't explain God. &gt;&gt; You've got to believe God. &gt;&gt; You can't explain God. I've stood behind this pulpit and I've tried to imitate Brother Brandham's movements and that is for this very purpose right here. I've heard these things. I've known these things. But in my testimony that I just gave down in Louisiana, and if you want to go back and see the go back and see the uh deep call to the deep and brother Benham, he has a prayer line up and there's a lady there and ministers are behind him. And then he he gets talking to the congregation. and he kind of gets inspired and he said if the God if people wouldn't believe me you know like if I were God sends his gifts and God sends his ministers and God sends this and he's talking like that and then then he turns around like this and he kind of shakes his head. That's the problem. He doesn't know what world he's in. &gt;&gt; And he sees this woman and he says, "It is, is this a patient?" That's exactly where he is. &gt;&gt; He's not sure. It's just in between. &gt;&gt; And then when you get up into that heavenly realm, as it were, and you're taking command of the every spirit's under my command right now. The angel of the Lord is here. I take possession of every spirit in this building. When did you ever hear a man say that? And then coming with that divine wisdom and telling people their names or whatever more. Then step down and you have to go home. &gt;&gt; Dear I I I would you take out the garbage. &gt;&gt; Then you're back in the real world. &gt;&gt; What's the garbage mean? What? What's I got to go to the store and get some groceries. What's that mean? I've just been a place there's no such a thing as &gt;&gt; shopping, no such a thing as a need. &gt;&gt; I just come from that divine presence. And now you're hearing this one. Unclean, &gt;&gt; worthless, &gt;&gt; sick, &gt;&gt; people afflicted, people possessed, &gt;&gt; walking down the street undressed, &gt;&gt; insanity. &gt;&gt; You never see such a thing like that. And people all taken up and Yeah. about this and that and about the other thing and all burdened about this and all the other things and it's is this the world. &gt;&gt; There's a place friends where this world doesn't matter very much. &gt;&gt; I hope it means something to you. He says, "Visions make me weak." You're living in two worlds. Now, we're not just talking about a prophet and what he experienced. &gt;&gt; I want you to go behind the scenes. God has sent this for you to hear, &gt;&gt; for you to visualize and see. for you to determine why he did that for you, for this congregation, for this ministry, for these brothers that are behind me. Why did God do this? Why should we be hearing that? &gt;&gt; Because you need it. &gt;&gt; For where you're going, this has been sent to help you to get there. &gt;&gt; He says you're in two worlds. You're here and then you're in another world. You can't help that. Just like you dreamed a dream. How many dreamed a dream last night? Don't be ashamed. Put up your hand if you dreamed a dream. Look at all these dreams. My goodness. Did it mean anything? Why? Why didn't you stop it and say, "I'm not going to have that." He can't stop it like you can't stop it. You just dream a dream &gt;&gt; and somebody doesn't dream. Why didn't you dream if you didn't dream? Shame on you. You should have dreamed something. You can't dream. He said he said some people subconscious and the conscious too far apart. And then those that dream, they're he said they come close together and that's where you dream. He said and the prophet they come right together. The conscious and the unconscious the consciousness come right together and he doesn't have to dream. He doesn't go into sleep to dream his dream. &gt;&gt; And he's not seeing a picture like you. And when you dream, you saw a picture and you saw all the colors and you saw everything. I had a dream the other night and it must have taken hours. But science tells me it just went through my mind. And how could my mind grasp all of that? I mean, so many details. It takes 15 minutes maybe to tell my wife the whole dream. And they say I had it in a quarter of a second, a split second. I I didn't know my mind was capable of that all that information in such a short time. Now now you'll understand I understand from brother Brandham's family that sometime when you go into uh go into interviews and has people lined up for interviews, he had the answer for all of them &gt;&gt; before they came. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or in a prayer line, why wouldn't he know this one &gt;&gt; if he's going to tell a dream? Well, you know, I was traveling to a certain place and the person comes up there and says, "Well, you came from a certain place. You came over here and your car was a color green and you have a letter in your pocket and and and you know, and this is why you're here." Then the next one and the next one. He says, "Well, you're living in two worlds. This is a redemption by power." And you're in a world here and you're in a world there. &gt;&gt; You're with somebody else maybe 50 years ago. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's in another world &gt;&gt; and he's with this person 50 years ago. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you what. I I told some of these things I haven't told my testimony very much. And uh Joanne said, "Dad, you haven't even told us some of those things." Brother Brandham told me about the blind man in Bombay, India, Mumbai now. And he was in India and this blind man, he was a sun worshipper and he burned his eyes out and they're just, you know, couldn't see anything. And brother Brandham went into a vision and saw him. Now, this will help you. Saw him uh doing something. So, he saw that he had he could tell by what he was doing. Now, Brother Bram's in the future. The man's not even there yet. &gt;&gt; I'll spin your head out. &gt;&gt; He's not even there yet. &gt;&gt; And he he he looks at the man in the vision. In the vision. Because he's there. &gt;&gt; He's in a future state. Why can't I remember the future as well as I remember the past? He did. &gt;&gt; And he told me, he says, I saw I looked at his sideburns &gt;&gt; and I could see some white hairs in it. And he says, and then he said, I, you know, had to come in between and look at him now. He said, look at his sideburns. And they were all black. He said, "So I knew he was going to have his vision, &gt;&gt; but he didn't have it yet." He says, "Then I had to exercise my faith that he would receive it right now." &gt;&gt; And I guess I was in the church where that happened &gt;&gt; in India &gt;&gt; with the with the host pastor's grandson &gt;&gt; and stood behind the table. They haven't even moved the table that brother Brandham preached behind. &gt;&gt; So it's real. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the man got his sight. And then they said, he said that the police and the deacons or whoever had to try to protect him, they wanted to tear his pants and have a piece of his cloth from his suit or whatever more because they're very given over to holy man, etc. They recognized right away that this was unearly. So he looked, didn't he? So, you know, you know now why I was saying when you walk out, &gt;&gt; you might well say, "I don't know anything." &gt;&gt; And we certainly have no right to question this kind of ministry. &gt;&gt; Said to somebody else maybe 50 years ago and you may be with somebody years from today. You may be with them 50 years ago and you may be with somebody years from today to come and yet you realize you're standing on the platform here and you're speaking something that that happened many many years ago, maybe weeks ago, months ago, another nation, another place or something. &gt;&gt; And you're standing there in a completely different environment. &gt;&gt; That world friends was this messenger had access. God gave him access so that we could have some understanding of where we're going. &gt;&gt; He didn't do this to tickle the ears. Didn't do this to, you know, surprise or shock the people. God didn't do this so that he would be glorified. That that the man would be glorified. God did this that he would be glorified that a people would rise up. And when this kind of ministry come and said, "Come out of her, my people. be separate, say the Lord. You would quiver and say, I will do that. &gt;&gt; I'm being called by another voice. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Contending for the faith, if you haven't heard that, the old tape that we have of contending for the faith has a when it comes to the end of the message, there's a small blank there. It's not on the current ones. It's not on the current tapes, but we have an old one we've preserved. My wife first heard this and I played it on the radio broadcast, but it is by brother Kelly was healed. He was in a terrible, terrible condition. And brother Brandham called him out and you can hear his voice and he's saying he's saying, "You've had a third of your stomach removed." Yes, I've had a third of my stomach removed. You're going to hear all of that on that tape. And he gives us testimony. So it does in contending for the faith kind of. You're working in two worlds. You're here and you're in another world. And when that goes out, then you go in and you see what you're uh what's standing near at the platform here. Listen to this. Angels of God and everything. uh and and you see hideous things that take place even from there because there there's nothing hidden &gt;&gt; and you see hideous things take place then you're wondering sometimes and that's the reason I said when God calls you and maybe you a minister God called me and made me a seer &gt;&gt; as he promised in the Bible &gt;&gt; and the people who believe the Bible say amen [Applause] &gt;&gt; in this world In this world, we may be total strangers, but in another world, we're all completely known. He says, "I'm not beside myself." &gt;&gt; But this is a dimension. Two worlds. See, in our presence, we're standing here looking at one another. He's with a person standing here looking at one another as men. I don't know you. I've never seen you. You're a total stranger to me. I don't know you. Now, he's talking in the present. &gt;&gt; I don't know you. never seen you, but we're now standing here looking at one another. &gt;&gt; So, by your features and your face, I never seen you. &gt;&gt; And we're strange to one another. But there's another world. &gt;&gt; Just out here &gt;&gt; where the supernatural is &gt;&gt; and that's where God lives. &gt;&gt; You're here as message believers. And that world is right here. And that's where God is. &gt;&gt; And you had a you had a physical prophet messenger who God gave access who stepped into that over a period of years and years and years. &gt;&gt; And that's where the Holy Spirit is. &gt;&gt; And he knows me &gt;&gt; and he knows you. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he knows me and he knows you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is speaking to one person as it happened to be a woman and he's talking to her and he's saying now you you were in another you were prayed for before. You were in an evangelistic meeting and you were prayed for before. You were prayed for by another man. And he begins to he said he's a a slim man kind of a slight man and his hair is and he started to say his hair is thinning. He said, "It's me." &gt;&gt; He's in another place, in another city, in another time, in another time zone. And he's describing the person praying for her in the past. And he says, "It's me." &gt;&gt; He said, "You, I prayed for you before." &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to leave this meeting today saying, "I follow a wonderful message. has been a wonderful revealing of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus did. &gt;&gt; This is where Jesus was. &gt;&gt; And and he sent it again &gt;&gt; to let me know of the place he went to prepare for us &gt;&gt; and for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. G &gt;&gt; immediately you know you're not in the presence of your brother. &gt;&gt; You're not in the presence of your brother. &gt;&gt; You're in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; So you started feeling something &gt;&gt; and the man or the woman doesn't know what they're feeling. He said and he tells a woman on deep call to the deep. He said, she reaches out. Now, it means something more to you now. You've heard me say it before. Touches the pulpit. He said, "Now, that's all right. That won't hurt you. &gt;&gt; That's him, not me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why he's saying it. He's in another world. &gt;&gt; And so, are you still with me? Am I all right for a little time yet? Just about 10 minutes. I'm going to close. I'll just close. And he says immediately, "No, you're not in the presence of your brother. You're in the presence of God. You're aware of that." And I have said, "Never in the history of mankind did God give such public and open access &gt;&gt; to the eternal realm." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot find never in the history of human mankind &gt;&gt; that God gave such immediate access. Amen. &gt;&gt; To the eternal realm. Why did he do that? &gt;&gt; Hello folks. Why did he do that? &gt;&gt; Why did he do that? &gt;&gt; So these people of this generation would be without excuse. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I go to prepare a place for you, Jesus said, I will come again and receive you unto myself &gt;&gt; that where I am, &gt;&gt; there you might be also. &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting this. &gt;&gt; He He made this display. He made this show &gt;&gt; not only to let you know there was another place, but to let you know this message has come to call you to that place and lead you to that place. And if you follow it, you'll end up in that place where Jesus said, I go to prepare a place. This is the place. &gt;&gt; There is no other place. This is the eternal realms. This is where God lives. This is where the Holy Spirit is. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to go. &gt;&gt; I want to go to heaven, don't you? &gt;&gt; There's something within a believer that's calling and desiring &gt;&gt; to know the times and the seasons. &gt;&gt; When will this be? We must be close. I get people writing me. They said, "Well, it it'll either be this year or next year." I don't know but I want to be there. I hope it's tomorrow or today. God cannot be explained in the timeline. And brother Ben Brandham in the future home he speaks of three stages of the world. And uh out of Peter out of second Peter third chapter speaks of whereby the world that then was. And then in the verse seven he said but the heavens and the earth which are now. &gt;&gt; And then later on but we look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. And then he goes on to say in the 11th verse seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved. What manner of persons ought we to be &gt;&gt; all these things. What's part what's troubling you right now? What are you groaning over? I know the greatest groaning is set up by the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; the prize of the rapture. That's my greatest groaning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Almost everyone here, I would say everyone here, you have something within you, a deep that's calling to the deep and it's a travail. That travailing is going on to birth you into that place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we have some earthly things happening, and I I have to get with it. I'm I'm going to have to cut some things out, but I want to get to this, please. Under each prophet, he said there's been birth pains. &gt;&gt; So, I'm into this travail. Now, &gt;&gt; this world, now I want I want to blend the two together for a moment so you have more to think about. this unseen world and the things that are happening in the unseen are unfolding. Shall I say this? In the midst of the things that are taking place, the events of the world in the in the midst of it, God is unfolding the fulfillment of his scripture. &gt;&gt; The two worlds are actually uh going along And in the midst of birth, Holocaust the after the second war or during the second world war during that birth pain Israel is having an incredible birth pain because it is that birth pain that actually gives birth to a nation and they end up in a flea from Poland and from Germany and from Russia and from all over Europe. They flee to go to their homeland, fulfilling the scripture, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Who's sending them back? God is sending them back. He said, "I will gather you. &gt;&gt; I scattered you. Now I will gather you." &gt;&gt; And he creates all kinds of conditions, war and economic things and all kinds of things happen. And there is a a rabbi and this rabbi's name is Shapiro. Colonimus Calaman Shapiro. He was considered a grand rabbi. Not grand in the sense of a nice grand rabbi, but a grand of certain status rabbi in Poland. He was murdered at 54 years old by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Uh but he survived quite a lot of it by working in a shoe factory. And he says this the pains he was received as a as a very notable rabbi by many and is also by the more modern rabbis. is not really that well thought of. But he said the pains leading to the revelation of Messiah are similar to labor pains, suffering and suffering that leads to birth. In a similar vein, when a seed is planted, it must first rot in the ground. Only after the seed ceases to exist will a wonderful plant sprout from it. This plant will have leaves and branches and bear fruit, many times the size of the original seed. All this was hidden potential within a tiny seed which first had to die. &gt;&gt; Does this sound familiar? &gt;&gt; Redemption is divine. &gt;&gt; The agents, in other words, the agents of redemption must be diminished. These are the pains of Messiah. Isaiah 66:9 says, "Shall I induce birth and not give birth?" Then says God uh in labor pain in labor and then he helps us to give birth. Of course, he's feeling of the the position of the Jewish nation which he needs to. He says the greater the labor pains, the greater uh the greater the divine light, I believe is what it says uh that they lead up to. These are the pains of disillusion dissolusion of the state of for the state of regeneration and pain for the sake and not pain for the sake of pain. &gt;&gt; Now, we're not just suffering because we're suffering. We're not caught in this thing by accident. &gt;&gt; This is in God's plan. And in the plan, we are suffering this enormous pain and travail on behalf of Messiah &gt;&gt; in the plan of Messiah. &gt;&gt; And then he went on to say, a seed must a seed must rot before the tea tree can grow. And as a woman must labor before she can give birth, so must we undergo the pains of Messiah before redemption comes. The master of the world brings salvation through suffering. I'm not speaking this. I'm simply quoting what he said. He doesn't have the message of course, but he is uh very very and brother Brandham says in the rapture now the rapture the rapture message. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; The fourth last service that corn of wheat fell in the ground and died under the dark age persecution. It went into the ground. It had to die. Any man spiritual can see that unless that seed dies and rot, it abides alone. &gt;&gt; And it had to go into the ground under the dark age. It laid there rotted and come forth in two blades of the Lutheran church. And he goes on, he said, "Have you noticed this last days? How it's begin to pull away?" Now, &gt;&gt; now notice what the prophet is speaking of in these last days. It has be to pull away now. &gt;&gt; It's be to pull away now. And when that and when that wheat begins to grow, then the shock begins to get away from it. Yes. &gt;&gt; He wasn't &gt;&gt; He wasn't sad. He wasn't trying to bring any heaviness on the people or explain why things are the way. This is what happens. &gt;&gt; And we enter into a travail. &gt;&gt; Yes. Maybe there's a loss of family or a loss of friends or a loss of whatever more. But and but it's in God's economy, there's no loss. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God is still absolutely true. No man can pluck mine out of my hand. &gt;&gt; Is that it? Toot for finish. That's it. End of subject. &gt;&gt; All that the father hath given me shall come. &gt;&gt; And no man can pluck them out of my hand. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter whether they're in this church or another building. I don't care where they are in the world. God knows those that are his. &gt;&gt; And therein we rest. And therein our faith is perfect and complete. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And so if you notice in the last days, yes." And then he said, "So the church really is in birth pains tonight." &gt;&gt; This is this day the scripture fulfilled. So the church is really in birth pains tonight again &gt;&gt; for the deliverance &gt;&gt; of the son &gt;&gt; son of God to come again. &gt;&gt; All of our theologians, all of our systems, all of our denominations has rotted right out from under us. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. and let it be heard wherever people want to hear my voice. They've completely rotted out from under us. In my lifetime, I sat on a log in the wilderness and all of the systems and denominations and friendships and all the ministers I'd preach preached in their pulpits and whatever more. I became tainted &gt;&gt; to them. I became tainted to me. I entered into a divine and glorious light and I counted nothing. I count it as just waste &gt;&gt; that I might win Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so we rejoice that things just rotted and and if people wanted to hang on to what was rotting and go, they have to go with it, I guess. So the church is really in birth pains and all the systems etc has rotted out right out from under us. So we are in birth pains &gt;&gt; and a message from God always throws the church into heavier pain. &gt;&gt; So when a message if you say this is a message from God you must expect it will throw us into heavier pain. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe we're not even there yet. &gt;&gt; But after a while, &gt;&gt; she's going to be delivered of a bride. &gt;&gt; And that'll bring forth Jesus Christ to his bride. &gt;&gt; This rabbi said a little further, and I'm going to quit now. As the seed must rot before the tree can grow, and as a woman must labor before she can give birth, so must we undergo the pains of Messiah before redemption comes. The master of the world brings salvation through suffering. Therefore, we must accept that these pains and understand their significance. We must not re rebel against God, but perceive the mercy of his ways. This is an exalted form of mercy. We find ourselves in the midst of this &gt;&gt; must realize that these are the pains of cleaving to God through nullifying our own existence. &gt;&gt; Say if this is what I was called for, &gt;&gt; so be it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sister Glattus Dao said to brother Brandham on a car seat. She said, "Brother Brandham, are you going to be here for the rapture?" He said, "No, I'm going to be killed." He said, "It's kind of an explosion." He said, "It it might be a gunshot. I don't know, but I'll not be here for the rapture." You know what? at the question of a dear sister whose house I stayed in and I and my wife stayed there many times. I took her funeral. She was that kind of a person. Brother Bam, are you going to be here during the rapture and immediately? No. In other words, what is it? Nullifying oneself to the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Moses, are you going to go into the promised land? No. you people rebelled and I call you rebels and I got angry and God just said that's it &gt;&gt; and for that reason I'm not able to go &gt;&gt; but Joshua will go my servant &gt;&gt; and Joshua will lead you in &gt;&gt; Jesus are you going to be here when the Holy Spirit know it's expedient for you that I go &gt;&gt; if I don't go he won't come so I'm I'm ready to nullify myself &gt;&gt; are you going to be here Hallelujah. And here we are to receive such a message and such a messenger &gt;&gt; to show us the way and to tell us about that world over and over and over and over and over again until you say how many times you have to tell it. I haven't even told you all the time. I'm in two worlds. And I'm preaching about two worlds. And that's the world. There's none of this stuff that you're going to be all caught up in and burdened about tomorrow. It's all meaningless. the grocery and the shopping and all the fashions and everything else in the future. It's all there's no future with God. He's already passed that. &gt;&gt; He's eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Oh, he's so wonderful. &gt;&gt; I wonder, Linda, I wonder if you can come and play something for me. And I can't sing it, but maybe can you fire up these microphones and maybe we can get somebody to help us. Brother uh Ryan. I need Brother Ryan. &gt;&gt; Glad for these gifts. &gt;&gt; Do we have the words to uh the lights of home? Seems I can see. Seems I can hear the angel sack with hearts of gold and a thousand strength. &gt;&gt; Earth holds no charms when I hear their sound. &gt;&gt; Sweet bula. Bula is married. &gt;&gt; Sweet bula land. Sweet married land. That's where the bride goes to the married land. &gt;&gt; My home. Sweet home. [Music] What's the first verse? How does the first verse start?

But I want to leave you this morning by telling you this is not a service. This is not just a service. This is more of an announcement of what's been laid before us. What's here in the messages &gt;&gt; and that's been sent &gt;&gt; to get you to move you forward towards this place. There's a place right now you say, "Well, is that tomorrow or the next day or the next week?" No, no, no. It's actually right now. &gt;&gt; You just have to resolve within yourself as I did this morning. There's a there's a place there's a place within the realm of this dimension, this other world. I want to move closer to it. I want it to impact this life. Amen. L &gt;&gt; I want the significance of this life to be dictated by the importance the importance of this life to be dictated by that world. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's hard. I know it's hard and we have a travail down here because our souls are crying out. There's something within you &gt;&gt; and I would like you to find a release for that. Even this morning, we can't pray for individuals, but we'll pray for our each one together. I want to pray with you. And I'm going to pray earnestly and sincerely that God will let us not not just peer. I don't want it just to be instant. I don't want just some new things to be heard or some little further information to I I don't want that. I'm praying that it will just you'll just the whole congregation just move. I thought about a young man, Brother Daniel, you wrote me wrote in our anniversary and I appreciated that. I just desire that God would I desire with everything that's in me. I know it's right there. Otherwise, all these things are they're just in vain. These are just some more services. Where are these people that were listening to this? The God of your groaning. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Between 3 and 4 this morning. I rolled over and wrote that in the dark. The God you're groaning. The God of Moses groaning &gt;&gt; met him in the bush. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I prayed, "Oh God, let the God of the desire within you, the God of your groaning come and meet you and say, I'm the God of Abraham. I'm the God of your forefathers." That's why you have that. I put that there. &gt;&gt; And like the prophet of God says, that desire, the desires that he's put in is us for him. Oh God, [Music] my soul cries out, "Oh Lord, how long till my &gt;&gt; just reach out now? [Music] &gt;&gt; Reach out. I can't I have my home in the sky. Nothing in this in this world. [Music] As a prayer will come of my to be free of the Christmas sea that stand. [Music] &gt;&gt; I have a father. He knows my name though. I have a father. [Music] He calls me [Music] and you never leave me. No matter where I go, [Music] he knows my name. He knows my everywhere. [Music] And I have a way [Music] before my heart. And before even time began my life [Music] confession. My he [Music] &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed. Heavenly Father, If you'd like to raise your hand, children, &gt;&gt; you feel free to do so. &gt;&gt; God, you see my craving. You see the yearning. You see the depth of my desire. You see where it's taken me. You see where my hands have drooped down sometimes when I felt it was almost almost impossible for me to go any further. But yet, you were there. You knew my name and you called me. Lord Jesus, I pray for each each one of the precious loved ones, your children. How you must love them. You came, you suffered. You came into travail and you purchased them. You bought them as your own children. And now you have said and you told your disciples, I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go to prepare a place, I will come again and receive you. And you said to them, "A little while and you'll see me no more. And then a little while you'll see me. I know that that's troubled you. And I I know that you can't understand that." Oh God. Oh God. And then you come in this generation and you tell us so clearly. So clearly, Lord, I marvel. I marvel. It went on so long. Meeting after meeting, crossing the nation and crossing the world, crossing the earth. Meetings all over. And you showed yourself as a pillar of light in Germany. You showed yourself as a pillar of light in Houston, Texas. You showed yourself over the people, oh God. You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And you're present here now. And that world is present here now. And you know our name. &gt;&gt; You know each one of us. We had to be born in this season. You had each one of us conceived at a certain time so that we would be here now to glorify you. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh God. I pray you'll move the people from the to enter reality from these things that are visible and seen and are passing away. They're they're transient. They're just here for a moment and then we're moving on. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we're getting ready to go home. I pray father you'll do something very deep and very rich in this people as I sought to pour out my heart oh God to the people and to stay with the thought as you had given it &gt;&gt; I pray father in the name of Jesus Christ you'll see our desires and move us oh God into a place of intimate fellowship divine with you Lord Jesus [Music] [Music] It was right in this birth pains. The prophet is speaking to the people about birth pains. He's speaking to us this morning about birth pains. our Lord Jesus. He said, "What?" And here's what he did. [Music] There's a woman, a stranger to me, never seen her, but she's got something wrong with one of her limbs. And that's your husband sitting next to you. You're not from here. You're from California and your name is Roland. [Music] There's a man, a colored man. Something wrong with his eyes. His work. He does something with a car. Polish his car. He's a car waxer. Your eyes are going bad. Your first name is Fred and your last name is Con. The man right behind there, he's not from here. From California, got a bad back. Mr. Owens, that's you. The Lord Jesus makes you well. I never seen you in my life. Little fella sitting here got a hernia, wearing glasses in a gray suit. Fred, God heals you if you believe it. Really accept it. Mrs. Holden sitting over there from him suffering with eye trouble. What are you crying for? You got a nervous breakdown, bronchitis, heart trouble. You believe that God will make you well. Sitting on the end of the seat there, you believe with all your heart Jesus Christ will make you well. All that nervousness will go from you. You feel like you're back to your right condition. The devil's lying to you. You accept it now. Rise up your hand. Raise up your hand and accept him. Okay, it's all over. He said, "What? This church is going through birth pain. Just finish that." No prayer line. Just finish that. I'm saying to this congregation and all who are listening, &gt;&gt; this age entered into a birth pain &gt;&gt; and the pains have gotten perhaps greater intensity and faster till one thing happens, another thing happens. Don't even consider it. Do you hear me? &gt;&gt; Don't even consider it. [Music] Don't get on all of this rasmatile. I can tell you, I tell you in the name of the Lord, if they would have had a Facebook years ago or if they would have had all this community uh connection years ago, uh the apostles would have been telling them it's not of this world. We have nothing to do with this world. &gt;&gt; All the science was a prophecy of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get enough education to get as much education as you need. I'm in favor of advanced education. That's fine to do whatever you need to do, but you live your life for God. &gt;&gt; All of these things, Peter says, shall be dissolved. &gt;&gt; That's this world. &gt;&gt; But in that world, &gt;&gt; this kind of wisdom, &gt;&gt; this kind of thing, &gt;&gt; well, will it it it's timeless. &gt;&gt; And that's where you're going, children. Glory to God. I'm ending with this. God knew when William Brandon would be born. &gt;&gt; God happened to know when Roland was conceived. He happened to know when Fred Khan was conceived. He happened to know when Mr. Owens was conceived. He happened to know where when Mrs. Holden was conceived. This God happened to know all of that. And he had that happen so that they would be there at that moment for this messenger to call them out as evidence to us years later that here it is. &gt;&gt; The other world is here. It's present. Knows your name. He knew when you would be conceived. He knew when you would come. He knew what the craving would be in your heart. He put it there for this place. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I say yay and amen. &gt;&gt; God raised us up. God knew when I would be conceived. God knew the direction and and the life and many sad things in my life and I won't even go into God knew that &gt;&gt; God knew the hardships. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Probably 40 years a hardships and poverty, &gt;&gt; not even knowing where I'd be sleeping sometime and make you ready for something that was in the future. God knew that I'd be troubled. God knew the craving and the travail that was gone within me. You haven't perhaps been there, but I was I was saying, "What's happening? &gt;&gt; What's happening to this world of Pentecost? What's happening to this great Holy Spirit that's moving on the people anointed?" Yes. What's happening? And then there it is. four questions, four answers, four scriptures right here in this Bible that I had read hundreds of times. &gt;&gt; Then what happened? A divine light &gt;&gt; on this scripture. &gt;&gt; What is it doing? It's fulfilling his purpose. That's what the the prophet of God sent to give light on this revealed Jesus Christ. And I can say I seen him, friends. I see him. And I want you to participate. You have participated. You've enjoyed it. But don't become burdened down. This travail has to happen. [Music] &gt;&gt; This bride must give birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; as Ruth. &gt;&gt; As Ruth, the redeemed gentile bride &gt;&gt; was redeemed by Boaz. &gt;&gt; The type of Christ gave her seed. We have had our Boaz has come in this season and he's already given us seed. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's not the seed of another son of man coming to do miracles. It's the seed of the son of David &gt;&gt; to sit on his throne &gt;&gt; because that's another phase of the same part of redemption. And and friends, it's already in the process. That's why they went through a travail. That's why they went through a holocaust. That's why they went That's why this rabbi was shot of a few. He survived much of it. And then 1943 November shocked. He gave his life but taught the people and he said and he gave teaching to the young people to the children. Gave teaching to the young married couples. gave teaching to tell them that that that they should not be distressed that this uh these these afflictions have come. It's part of the redemption. And he was dead on. He said the seed must rot. &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God comes and tells us the seed must rot. And I've experienced that the seed is rotted, friends. And a new divine light has come and moving us to the rapture. This is of him. This is his work, not our work. This is his work. &gt;&gt; He started it and he shall finish it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; He shall finish it. &gt;&gt; If we haven't got it just right, don't worry. He'll have it just right. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we haven't got the timing exactly right, he'll have the timing just exactly right. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh, friends, I hope you can taste and come and taste and see that the Lord is good. I feel beside myself. Participate. Say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; let me in on this." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is real, friends. &gt;&gt; Your job will be dissolved. &gt;&gt; All of these associations and relationships will be dissolved. This world shall be dissolved. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that one, the prophet has told us, hasn't got automobiles and cars and gasoline and airplanes. None of those schedules. Oh, God help us. Roland and Fred Khan and these people, you individually, your name. He knew your name. He knew you'd be standing here. He knew you'd be in this service. He knew you'd be hearing these things cuz he's reaching out to you. Not me, him. He's reaching out to you saying, "I want you to know about me more.
