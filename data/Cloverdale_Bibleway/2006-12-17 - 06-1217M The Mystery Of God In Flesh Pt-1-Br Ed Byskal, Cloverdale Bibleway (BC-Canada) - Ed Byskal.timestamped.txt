[34:25] As I thought and meditated upon
[34:29] uh Brother Chedameir and Sister Danka
[34:32] and their family being here today, I
[34:35] immediately thought, Brother Chedare,
[34:37] Sister Danka of the of a long journey
[34:43] that they have made not to come to
[34:45] church this morning so much, but the
[34:48] long journey
[34:50] in coming to where they are day from
[34:54] where they were. And I thought of I
[34:58] thought of brother Chetameir's
[35:00] experience in a bitter bitter conflict
[35:03] of war
[35:05] and being a prisoner and coming out
[35:09] weighing not too many pounds for a man
[35:11] his size and for this woman here to have
[35:15] prayed and prayed and prayed and
[35:19] believed for him and he wasn't a
[35:21] believer yet. he wasn't a Christian yet
[35:23] and that God preserved him out of a
[35:26] horrific conflict in Bosnia and then
[35:31] allowed them to find entrance and the
[35:34] United States opened their arms and
[35:36] received them and they said where where
[35:40] do you want to go? Well, you know, we
[35:42] have a cousin or something in in
[35:44] Lincoln, Nebraska. All right, there you
[35:46] go. and they and and they need a place
[35:49] to fellowship and they need a place to
[35:51] feed and hear the word of God and to
[35:54] raise their children. And that became
[35:56] the search. And I as I thought of you,
[35:59] brother Chedir, I thought this is a son
[36:02] of Abraham and a daughter of Abraham.
[36:05] And one day Abraham was met by another
[36:09] person that was Melzdc.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; And I thought, you have met that same
[36:14] one. You've met him. and he came by your
[36:18] way. You didn't find him, but he found
[36:21] you.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what happened. And then
[36:27] Abraham, his nature was he was so
[36:31] overwhelmed and overcome
[36:34] by the fact that this great one had come
[36:36] and met him and gave him bread and wine.
[36:39] He didn't have any children.
[36:42] Abraham didn't have anything to offer
[36:44] him. He just gave him tithes of all that
[36:47] he had because that's all he had. He
[36:49] just had some material things. He didn't
[36:52] have any possessions. But what was in
[36:54] the mind of Melzdc was I'm going to give
[36:56] this man a son.
[36:59] I'm going to give him children and I'm
[37:01] going to make him a father of many
[37:02] nations. But Abraham didn't Abraham had
[37:05] that promise but hadn't had anything
[37:07] yet. And now, Brother Chedimir,
[37:11] you live in a home and you drive a car
[37:13] and you have a few material things. But
[37:16] I think God is very pleased that you're
[37:18] coming here this morning to say, "Here's
[37:21] really what we are."
[37:23] &gt;&gt; This is all we have. And this we're
[37:26] going to dedicate to God's service. And
[37:29] God has put that in your heart. And I I
[37:33] believe that God is pleased. The same
[37:36] God that showed himself in Melzdc has
[37:39] come to meet another son of Abraham. And
[37:42] uh and now out of his heart and soul and
[37:45] his wife, they say, "Here we are. This
[37:48] is all we are. This is all we have. But
[37:51] we give it to you."
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:55] We're going to pray together.
[37:57] Heavenly Father,
[38:00] &gt;&gt; this family that stands here at this
[38:03] sacred moment,
[38:05] &gt;&gt; you have placed something within their
[38:07] hearts,
[38:09] &gt;&gt; not just for this moment, but long ago,
[38:12] and they've desired to give themselves
[38:14] so unreservedly to you. And Lord, you
[38:18] you were speaking to them even in their
[38:22] youth. And Lord, how our sister just
[38:24] sanka prayed and you heard her prayers
[38:29] and you showed her that you were a God
[38:31] that answered prayers. You preserved my
[38:35] precious brother Cheddameir. Lord, you
[38:38] have brought him on a very long journey
[38:40] this family. And now you have prospered
[38:43] them and given them children and they
[38:46] come with their children. even their
[38:49] daughter. Lord, you put it in her heart
[38:51] to be baptized and she'll be baptized in
[38:54] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this
[38:57] evening. Lord, it will be an eternal
[39:00] work in her life. I pray that you will
[39:03] bless these children with health. Oh
[39:05] God, I pray that you'll bless them with
[39:07] the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:10] in salvation. I pray that you'll bless
[39:12] them with a testimony wherever they are
[39:15] around their friends, around their
[39:18] school friends. Lord, I pray that you'll
[39:21] bless their children, oh God. And
[39:23] especially I ask, oh God, for my brother
[39:26] Cedir, Sister Danka, you'll give them
[39:29] wisdom as they rear up these children.
[39:32] Father, this this will all this day will
[39:35] always be remembered as they dedicate
[39:38] themselves, give themselves to your
[39:41] service. And now, Father, I dedicate
[39:43] them in the name of Jesus Christ. And
[39:47] there will be another gathering
[39:50] when this family will be enlarged,
[39:53] oh God. And they'll gather with the
[39:56] family of God from all nations and
[39:59] tongues and people. And that is why
[40:02] they're standing here today. And on that
[40:04] day, I pray Lord, the circle shall not
[40:06] be unbroken.
[40:09] In Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Ched. Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Bless you, sister.
[40:19] God bless you, children. Bless you,
[40:21] Susanna. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Amen.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Dier's parents have been
[40:32] welcomed, but I'd like to welcome you in
[40:34] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:37] Welcome to America,
[40:39] North America.
[40:44] Hallelujah.
[40:47] I'm sure your son and daughter-in-law
[40:50] will make you happy.
[40:53] We have another
[40:57] uh
[40:59] someone else I want to remember. Where's
[41:00] Adam Brooks? I heard that Adam Brooks is
[41:05] here.
[41:07] Adam, will you stand up? Where are you?
[41:12] Is he in church this morning? I come to
[41:15] welcome him.
[41:19] I don't see him.
[41:22] Uh
[41:24] he and Angela saw some of our family the
[41:28] other day. And uh Adam, if you're here
[41:32] or in the fellowship room, I don't only
[41:36] want to welcome him here for a short
[41:38] stay. Many of you that know Adam and he
[41:42] grew up here. I remember spending some
[41:45] time with him alone in my study. And he
[41:48] was a boy about 10. And he touched my
[41:52] heart that day as we spoke together. And
[41:55] I saw in that small fellow a man and now
[42:00] he's a man. He's a he's in the armed
[42:03] services and he has to go to Iraq in
[42:07] February.
[42:09] So I pray that he'll come out safely,
[42:12] come home safely. And I for all of you
[42:15] that know Adam Brooks, I I would say I
[42:18] pray that he will come to the knowledge
[42:22] that we're in a greater army than the US
[42:25] Army or any other human army. We're in
[42:28] the army of God.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:31] Hallelujah.
[42:33] Well, we before we go to the word, can
[42:36] we just take a couple moments on on
[42:39] Brazil because I know that you're
[42:42] anxious to know we're not going to take
[42:43] a lot of time, but brother Tony arrived
[42:46] in Brazil ahead of myself a couple of
[42:49] days just to finetune arrangements for
[42:53] the meetings and so on. And uh then
[42:56] Thursday evening
[42:59] uh of last week, Brother Tony preached
[43:03] there. And then Friday morning, we made
[43:07] uh two uh television broadcast. The name
[43:10] of the broadcast is Perfect Faith. I
[43:13] thought that was a great name.
[43:16] And uh I don't know all of the details,
[43:20] but uh brother Tony has many more
[43:22] details and perhaps we might be able to
[43:25] be ready on Wednesday and show you more
[43:28] and tell you more details. So we won't
[43:30] take a lot of time right now but uh it's
[43:35] being powerfully effective and I will I
[43:38] will tell you this since its inception
[43:41] what is it about 9 months
[43:44] about nine months that it has been and
[43:47] brother Cesar he did not really
[43:50] anticipate he didn't know what all he
[43:52] knew is that this time was made
[43:54] available for him to go on a national
[43:57] the the it's a Christian broadcasting
[43:59] station, national broadcasting station
[44:02] called Genesis and all the big people
[44:05] are on it as far as you know different
[44:07] denominations and something but to think
[44:10] that the voice of this message and he
[44:12] preaches it fearlessly believe me how he
[44:16] is on there is more than I can even
[44:18] imagine and I'm sure that there's a
[44:22] there's a lot of pressure of foot to
[44:24] have him knocked off and have him taken
[44:26] off but he just blasts
[44:29] word. I mean, it is incredible. And uh
[44:33] they had they've had 3600
[44:37] over 3600
[44:39] that's 3,600
[44:41] phone calls, contacts, letters, phone
[44:46] calls, whatever contact. And these
[44:49] people, they want to they want to have
[44:52] some answers. They want to get a book.
[44:54] They want some details. They're hearing
[44:57] things they've never heard before. And u
[45:00] uh brother Tony had a very rare unusual
[45:04] experience with brother Cesar. I'm going
[45:06] to let him come up and tell that. And
[45:09] and if you would come now, brother Tony.
[45:11] And it's it's touching. You can just
[45:13] imagine. You know, you know who has a
[45:15] lot of questions? Preachers. Yes. Right.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; They got a lot of questions because
[45:20] they're studying weekly and they realize
[45:25] lots of good sincere preachers know that
[45:28] their denomination or what they're
[45:30] serving isn't giving them the answer.
[45:33] And when they hear this, it's some
[45:35] difference. So, brother Tony, if you'd
[45:37] just speak of the experience in the
[45:39] restaurant and also the uh pastor, the
[45:42] Pentecostal pastor.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you, saints. Indeed. U
[45:46] the broadcast of brother Cesar is
[45:48] reaching out in many ways and uh you
[45:51] know with the work of God it's always
[45:54] what you don't see that is so amazing
[45:57] and uh and so as we uh brother Ed was
[46:00] mentioning brother Cesar and I we were
[46:01] just uh winding up in an evening and we
[46:03] went to a restaurant to have a bite to
[46:05] eat and we're just standing at the
[46:06] buffet table just kind of going around
[46:08] and this man just kind of rushes up to
[46:11] brother Cesar and uh and just thrusts
[46:13] his hand right right to him and say,
[46:15] "Pastor, pastor, uh, Cesar," he says.
[46:18] And then he began to speak to him in in
[46:20] Portuguese, and I didn't understand what
[46:21] was going on, but uh, this man's eyes
[46:24] began to well up with tears. And as I
[46:27] understood afterwards from listening to
[46:29] brother Cesar, and we stood at this at
[46:32] this buffet table for like five almost
[46:34] 10 minutes, and this p this man would
[46:36] just point out his heart to pastor
[46:38] Cesar. And the essence of it was was
[46:41] here he was a doctor in the city of Jean
[46:44] Pasoa and he was a Christian and he had
[46:48] been uh he had discovered the TV
[46:50] broadcast of Feeta and he'd been
[46:53] watching it without fail and he wanted
[46:56] to uh to to step further in obedience to
[46:59] the word of God and when he saw brother
[47:01] Cesar and I at the at the restaurant
[47:03] there he was convicted in his heart. He
[47:05] knew that brother Biscll and I were
[47:06] there for special meetings on the
[47:08] weekend. And he said, "I want you to
[47:10] know how much your program has blessed
[47:12] me. I know I'm not baptized, right? I
[47:14] know I haven't been walking uh correctly
[47:16] in the light of God's word." He said,
[47:17] "Your broadcast helps me so much." He
[47:20] said, "I am coming Sunday because I want
[47:23] to be rebaptized in the name of the Lord
[47:25] Jesus Christ."
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. And you know that if
[47:31] one man comes in a situation like that,
[47:34] how many hundreds, how many thousands
[47:37] around the nation that don't have a
[47:40] chance to to meet brother Cesar and to
[47:42] speak to him are being affected around
[47:44] the country.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; And that happens uh when I was there in
[47:48] in uh in October for the dedication and
[47:52] uh we went to check in at the hotel that
[47:53] brother Bisl and I were staying at. the
[47:55] very man that was there checking us in.
[47:57] As soon as he saw brother Cesar, he just
[47:58] began to speak to him and said, "I saw
[48:00] your broadcast. I watch it every day."
[48:02] And then again, even another incident on
[48:04] this trip was that we went to a a place
[48:07] of business and another woman just came
[48:09] right up and said, "I I watch your
[48:11] broadcast. It's such a blessing." And
[48:12] so, it was uh tremendously encouraging
[48:15] to be able to have these experiences and
[48:17] and know that this is a great effectual
[48:20] open door. We don't know how long it's
[48:22] going to last, but I tell you what,
[48:24] saints, there's a there's a stir going
[48:26] on in Brazil, not only amongst
[48:27] individuals, but there was a pastor that
[48:30] also uh is representative of numerous
[48:33] pastors. Uh brother Cesar has sent out
[48:36] church age books to several hundred
[48:39] pastors that are watching this broadcast
[48:40] and hearing things that they've never
[48:42] heard for the first time. and several
[48:44] pastors uh ministers that have been
[48:47] watching and and have been moved upon
[48:49] and have taken us deeper step of faith.
[48:51] Uh one of them was brother Henriki from
[48:53] the city of Macio. He drove 750
[48:56] kilometers just to be in these meetings
[48:57] for this weekend. There was women, two
[49:00] women, two ladies in the capital city of
[49:02] Brazilia, which is about a 3hour flight.
[49:05] That would be like as far away as as
[49:07] Manitoba. and hearing the broadcast,
[49:10] knowing that an eyewitness or the
[49:11] prophet was going to be in the meetings.
[49:13] She and her daughter flew out to be in
[49:15] these meetings. Unfortunately, we didn't
[49:16] get a chance to meet them, but we did
[49:18] have uh interviews with three other
[49:20] pastors, and we're going to maybe show
[49:22] that to you on Wednesday. And this
[49:23] pastor, Henriki, he uh he's uh living in
[49:26] a slum area of the city, but yet he's
[49:28] over four churches, and he's bringing
[49:30] these churches into the deeper things of
[49:33] the word of God. So, just a little
[49:35] little anticipation of uh of what we're
[49:37] going to have for you on Wednesday. And
[49:39] uh of course, brother Cesar sends his
[49:41] love and greetings and uh even gave a
[49:43] little gift to brother Ed. I don't know,
[49:44] he'll say maybe more about that. So, God
[49:46] bless you. Thank you, brother.
[49:52] Uh the pastor that brother Tony just
[49:54] speaks of that is over four churches was
[49:57] a Pentecostal pastor and he just his
[50:00] wife saw the broadcast and his wife said
[50:04] to him, "Dear, you need to listen to
[50:06] this man. You should hear this man." And
[50:09] soon as he heard him, it just gripped.
[50:11] And not only that, his eyes were just
[50:13] open. It was like scales fell from his
[50:15] eyes and he could not let go of it. And
[50:19] he just pursued he's been absorbing the
[50:21] message with an incredible intense
[50:24] hunger. And it you can you can you can
[50:28] only answer it by saying it's a
[50:30] sovereign work of almighty God. Amen. I
[50:35] have just a short clip DVD clip. You can
[50:37] see a little bit of the church. if
[50:39] they'll just show that just now just uh
[50:41] like about two minutes shows the church
[50:44] and then brother Cesar uh welcomes
[50:47] myself to the pull pit and then he comes
[50:50] forward I just tell you this because we
[50:52] don't have interpretation and has the
[50:54] people stand in the church that uh that
[50:58] came just locally as a result of the uh
[51:02] broadcast and the reason we say that is
[51:04] because uh the people of this
[51:06] congregation you have made that
[51:08] broadcast possible for this first year.
[51:11] And these are the fruits of your labors
[51:14] as well.
[51:38] picture is a the church is built on a
[51:42] steep hillside so they have underground
[51:44] parking.
[52:23] music
[52:26] and then otherwise go
[52:34] Yes.
[52:48] I'd like you to know that
[52:53] there are many people here.
[53:04] You were blessed by the broadcast on TV.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; I want to ask them
[53:12] and you be a witness.
[53:21] How many people are coming to the
[53:22] message
[53:25] like ask
[53:28] this morning.
[53:39] Please stand up.
[54:11] Praise God.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; So I want you to see
[54:18] some part of this.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Cesar.
[54:39] That was about half the congregation
[54:42] that you saw because they couldn't pan
[54:44] the rest of it. So you saw about half
[54:46] the church. This church seats 1050
[54:50] people and uh it was packed to the
[54:52] walls. Uh they were out in the foyer and
[54:56] everywhere else. Well, we praise the
[54:59] Lord for that.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Just want to make sure we're not
[55:02] forgetting anything. Do you rejoice in
[55:05] these things?
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet and we're
[55:10] going to open our Bibles please to
[55:12] Colossians the first chapter
[55:16] and we'll begin to read at the first
[55:18] verse. Before we do, we'll ask the
[55:22] Lord's blessing upon the word.
[55:27] Dear father God,
[55:30] so many times we do not know
[55:33] all that you are doing. We are simply
[55:36] walking by faith. We're simply trusting
[55:39] you. And today, once again, we have
[55:42] gathered here, Lord, all that are here
[55:45] within this congregation, within the
[55:48] walls of these this building, but Lord,
[55:52] the uh the audience, Father, that you
[55:55] have also uh allowed us to come into
[55:58] their homes, into their rooms, into
[56:01] their churches, wherever it may be. this
[56:05] uh the invisible audience. Lord, we are
[56:08] greeting them in the name of the Lord
[56:11] Jesus Christ and we're thanking you for
[56:15] the body of Jesus Christ, the bride of
[56:18] Jesus Christ. And Lord, the opportunity
[56:21] to stand once again and to declare your
[56:24] gospel, to declare your truth that you
[56:28] have given us, we will do so with all
[56:30] the strength and the courage that you
[56:33] shall give us. Instill within each of
[56:35] us, Lord, that kind of hunger, Lord
[56:38] Jesus, that you spoke about when you
[56:41] said these words, "Blessed are ye that
[56:43] hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[56:46] for you shall be filled."
[56:48] We want to be those that are filled
[56:50] today, Lord. And so we will be those
[56:53] that hunger. Create within us a great
[56:55] heart, Lord, to hunger and thirst after
[56:58] you. Bless all that are within the sound
[57:01] of my voice today in the name of Jesus
[57:04] Christ by the Holy Spirit. Breathe upon
[57:08] us, I pray, for your glory. And we'll
[57:11] thank you for it. Amen.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I thank the Lord. Amen.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; For the things that he has done, I say,
[57:19] "Praise God for the family of God.
[57:22] Healings that I've heard, supernatural
[57:25] healings which have just taken place. I
[57:27] thank God for it from the depths of my
[57:30] heart." We're going to read from the
[57:31] first verse, Colossians 1, down to verse
[57:35] 6, and then we'll start at verse 15.
[57:39] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[57:42] will of God in Tim Timoththeus our
[57:44] brother to the saints notice it's to the
[57:48] saints and faithful brethren in Christ
[57:52] which are at Colasse grace be unto you
[57:55] and peace from God our father and the
[57:58] Lord Jesus Christ we give thanks to God
[58:02] and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[58:05] praying always for you since we heard of
[58:09] your faith in Christ Jesus and of the
[58:12] love which you have to all the saints
[58:16] for the hope which is laid up for you in
[58:19] heaven whereof you heard before in the
[58:22] word of the truth of the gospel which is
[58:25] come unto you and as we read this sixth
[58:28] verse I want you to think of even this
[58:30] vast nation of Brazil which we just
[58:32] journeyed to and have returned which has
[58:35] come unto you as it is in all the world,
[58:39] and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth
[58:41] also in you. And since the day you heard
[58:44] of it, and knew the grace of God in
[58:47] truth. Verse 15, who is the image of the
[58:51] invisible God, the firstborn of every
[58:54] creature. For by him were all things
[58:56] created, that are in heaven and that are
[58:59] in earth, visible and invisible, whether
[59:03] they be thrones or dominions or
[59:06] principalities or powers. All things
[59:08] were created by him and for him. And he
[59:13] is before all things, and by him all
[59:16] things consist. And that really means in
[59:20] him all things have been permanently
[59:23] placed. Amen.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; In him all things consist. They have
[59:27] been permanently placed in him.
[59:31] For it pleased the Father that in him
[59:34] should all fullness dwell. and down to
[59:36] verse 24. Who now rejoice in my
[59:39] sufferings for you, and fill up that
[59:41] which is behind of the afflictions of
[59:44] Christ in my flesh for his body's sake,
[59:48] which is the church, whereof I am made a
[59:50] minister, according to the dispensation
[59:53] of God, which is given to me for you to
[59:56] fulfill the word of God, even the
[59:59] mystery. Notice if it please as we
[1:00:02] finish the 25th verse this dispensation
[1:00:06] of God which was given to the Apostle
[1:00:08] Paul for you for the church to fulfill
[1:00:12] the word of God even the mystery which
[1:00:16] was which hath been hid from ages and
[1:00:20] from generations but now is made
[1:00:23] manifest to his saints to whom God would
[1:00:26] make known what is the riches of the
[1:00:29] glory of this mystery among the
[1:00:31] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[1:00:34] hope of glory whom we preach. What are
[1:00:38] they preaching? They're preaching the
[1:00:40] mystery of Christ in you. That's what
[1:00:43] and and notice it says which is Christ
[1:00:45] in you, the hope of glory. The hope of
[1:00:48] glory. And then Apostle Paul says whom
[1:00:50] we preach. So it's a person he's
[1:00:53] preaching. The mystery, the mystery of
[1:00:56] Christ in you is a person. He's speaking
[1:00:59] that even this great mystery whom we
[1:01:02] preach.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; It's Christ that's being preached and he
[1:01:06] is that mystery of the indwelling in the
[1:01:09] believer whom we preach warning every
[1:01:11] man and teaching every man in all wisdom
[1:01:14] that we may present every man perfect in
[1:01:17] Christ Jesus where unto I also labor
[1:01:20] striving according to his working which
[1:01:23] workketh in me mightily. God bless his
[1:01:26] word and bless you as you have your
[1:01:27] seats. We've been rather long with the
[1:01:29] preliminaries, but uh uh this is the
[1:01:33] Lord's day
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; and this is his place of worship. Now
[1:01:39] the apostle Paul, he's declaring that
[1:01:43] he's a minister
[1:01:45] according to the dispensation
[1:01:48] or that season uh the dispensation of
[1:01:51] God which had been given to him to
[1:01:55] fulfill the word of God as I said a
[1:01:57] moment ago to fulfill the word of God
[1:01:59] even the mystery which hath been hid
[1:02:04] from ages and from generations. Now I
[1:02:07] want to take you into some slides
[1:02:09] immediately
[1:02:10] uh and uh just be a little bit patient
[1:02:15] here with us because I want to I have a
[1:02:19] number of slides that will set the basis
[1:02:22] for the for the message and I won't
[1:02:24] likely finish uh today
[1:02:28] but now this first slide is is on the
[1:02:32] scripture
[1:02:38] Even the mystery which hath been hid
[1:02:50] from ages and from generations. Notice
[1:02:52] from ages and generations because we're
[1:02:56] going to go into that in just a moment.
[1:02:58] But now is made manifest. didn't say it
[1:03:01] was completed, but it's being made
[1:03:02] manifest to his saints. Not to everyone,
[1:03:07] but to his saints. And to whom God would
[1:03:09] make known what is the riches of the
[1:03:13] glory of this mystery,
[1:03:16] which is Christ in you, the hope of
[1:03:18] glory. And I would like to I want to
[1:03:21] address something this morning that is
[1:03:25] uh
[1:03:27] doesn't merely intrigue me but
[1:03:30] captivates my thought.
[1:03:34] This thought of Christ in you not only
[1:03:38] the hope of glory but God in flesh is
[1:03:43] something that I have a hard time
[1:03:45] comprehending.
[1:03:46] God in flesh, you know, and and
[1:03:51] sometimes we cringe at that because
[1:03:53] we're so conscious of our flesh, but
[1:03:56] Jesus said, you know, I'm in the Father
[1:03:59] and the Father's in me and I'm in you.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. Do we water that
[1:04:05] down?
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Is Christ diluted somehow? Is he
[1:04:08] something less in me than he is outside
[1:04:11] of me? is and in this scripture speak uh
[1:04:16] several times of of the spirit of God
[1:04:20] which dwelleth in you and don't you know
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; the scripture says don't you know I'm
[1:04:26] putting it in our vernacular don't you
[1:04:28] know that you're the temple of the Holy
[1:04:31] Ghost
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; which dwelleth in you well now does is
[1:04:36] it am I to understand that somehow from
[1:04:38] the time that's spoken or from wherever
[1:04:41] the spirit of God is till it permeates
[1:04:44] my being. It is diluted. It is watered
[1:04:47] down. It is weakened. It is made
[1:04:49] something different. Or am I to assume
[1:04:52] that it is indeed the spirit of God that
[1:04:56] enters into a person causes them to be a
[1:04:59] son of God and that there's no
[1:05:01] attribute, there's nothing that is
[1:05:03] lessened, there's nothing that is
[1:05:05] weakened. It is full strength God coming
[1:05:08] into an individual.
[1:05:10] That's very very very intriguing for me.
[1:05:14] Captivating.
[1:05:15] I'm mesmerized by that thought.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; God in flesh.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of the community out there
[1:05:23] will tell you, "Ah, that's the first
[1:05:25] sign of a cult."
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; If that's a sign of a cult, I want to be
[1:05:30] part of that cult.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of those that can
[1:05:33] believe unto having God in flesh.
[1:05:38] Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; And I don't know what they do with all
[1:05:43] of these scriptures which we're going to
[1:05:45] be giving you today.
[1:05:56] Ages
[1:05:57] and this is in the Greek. Now I have
[1:06:00] some Greek and some Hebrew. So ages aon
[1:06:05] perpetuity of time.
[1:06:08] It is eternity.
[1:06:11] It is forever.
[1:06:14] It is the worlds or h can have reference
[1:06:18] to the worlds in the universe. And so
[1:06:20] the apostle Paul has the audacity
[1:06:24] to declare
[1:06:26] even to apostles who have who have
[1:06:29] walked with the Lord Jesus Christ. But
[1:06:31] he's able to say God has held this for
[1:06:36] all of the per perpetuity of time for
[1:06:41] all this eternity without beginning
[1:06:43] without end. Of course, that's what this
[1:06:45] word can mean forever. The world's the
[1:06:48] universe and he said and and
[1:06:51] generations.
[1:06:53] That which has been uh generations. I'm
[1:06:57] sorry. Don't know why the first part
[1:06:59] didn't come up. generations
[1:07:02] which is Gina Gina and that is that
[1:07:06] which has been begotten
[1:07:08] has been begotten men of the same stock.
[1:07:11] In other words, Paul is saying this this
[1:07:14] is not only a time element that this has
[1:07:18] been hidden, but this is also concerns
[1:07:22] peoples, nations of peoples, that which
[1:07:26] has been begotten by man, that men of
[1:07:29] the same sort, the whole multitude of
[1:07:32] men living at the same time. He's saying
[1:07:34] this has been hidden.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; This has been completely hidden. This
[1:07:40] has not been made known,
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; but now it's being made manifest.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; And that same God
[1:07:49] can have and this have the same effect
[1:07:52] and saying these things that have been
[1:07:54] sealed in the seven seals. They've been
[1:07:59] sealed and you can put the same
[1:08:00] application to it. They've been sealed
[1:08:03] throughout all of this time. nations and
[1:08:06] the whole begotten of mankind and all of
[1:08:10] the peoples of the earth and the
[1:08:12] intelligencia and all of this all the
[1:08:15] hierarchy and whatever more it's been
[1:08:18] hidden
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; and Paul could say it's been hidden
[1:08:22] because he also would continue to speak
[1:08:24] and it would be made known it would be
[1:08:26] open and it is open does do does
[1:08:29] everyone understand it? No, everyone
[1:08:31] doesn't understand it but that doesn't
[1:08:33] mean it hasn't been opened.
[1:08:36] It has been made open. It's been it has
[1:08:38] been it has been made uh it's been made
[1:08:42] known
[1:08:46] now.
[1:08:53] And God said,
[1:08:56] "Let us make man in our image, after our
[1:08:59] likeness,
[1:09:02] in our image, and after our likeness.
[1:09:06] And let them have dominion over the fish
[1:09:08] of the sea, and over the fowl of the
[1:09:10] air, and over the cattle, and over all
[1:09:13] the earth, and over every creeping thing
[1:09:16] that creepeth upon the earth." So God
[1:09:19] created man in his own image in the
[1:09:22] image of God created he him male and
[1:09:26] female created he them. Now it was the
[1:09:29] image that was lost in Eden. And it is
[1:09:33] the image that this struggle that is
[1:09:37] taking place over this what we call the
[1:09:40] earth is a struggle over the image.
[1:09:45] I just I want to make these statements
[1:09:47] to you. It's a struggle over the image
[1:09:50] because the scripture which we began to
[1:09:52] read said who is the image of the
[1:09:55] invisible God. God said in the beginning
[1:09:59] that he would make an image. The the
[1:10:01] mystery is the image of God cannot be
[1:10:05] reestablished on the earth unless God
[1:10:09] can dwell in these human vessels.
[1:10:12] Without God being in flesh, there's no
[1:10:16] way he's going to be able to establish
[1:10:19] his image. And the and and the the real
[1:10:23] uh the struggle and the turmoil and the
[1:10:25] battle that is taking place literally on
[1:10:28] the earth is Satan wants to establish
[1:10:30] not only his kingdom but his image in
[1:10:33] that kingdom. And God has established
[1:10:36] his domain, his control, and he's he's
[1:10:40] taking possession of this. Not only the
[1:10:43] mankind, but the earth as well.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; So God created man in his own image, in
[1:10:49] the image of God created he
[1:10:52] he him. Male and female created he them.
[1:10:56] It seems to me that God
[1:10:59] wanted to make certain there was no
[1:11:03] mistake because in these two verses he
[1:11:06] has made so many references. Let us make
[1:11:09] man in our image and after our likeness
[1:11:14] and let them have dominion etc. So God
[1:11:17] created man in his own image and in the
[1:11:21] image of God created he him. Male and
[1:11:25] female created he them. Now I want you
[1:11:28] to notice there's a difference between
[1:11:32] uh in verse 26 and verse 27. In verse 26
[1:11:36] the word for make is the Hebrew word
[1:11:39] assa and the Hebrew word for create in
[1:11:42] verse 27 is the word barah. And they are
[1:11:46] they are different in their in their
[1:11:49] meanings.
[1:11:54] The Hebrew word for make assa means to
[1:11:57] mold or make something from existing
[1:12:00] materials. I want you to hold that now.
[1:12:03] And the word bear or for create in verse
[1:12:07] 27 is to create something new out of
[1:12:11] nothing.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Man is a unique creature. Yes,
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; the believer is a unique creature. Now,
[1:12:19] the believer, the believer, so many of
[1:12:21] the things that brother Brandham has
[1:12:23] said as a prophet of God should be going
[1:12:25] through your mind at this time, and I
[1:12:27] shouldn't have to draw actually pictures
[1:12:29] for it, but when you hear him say that
[1:12:32] we have a a gene of God, the believer,
[1:12:35] and when the spirit of God strikes that
[1:12:39] germmitized seed, that's something that
[1:12:42] came to you out of nothing. But you are,
[1:12:44] we are a unique being. We're sitting
[1:12:46] here in bodies of flesh that God has
[1:12:50] allowed to come up out of the soil of
[1:12:52] the earth. Your body came up out of the
[1:12:56] soil. No mystery. It's going back to the
[1:12:59] dust, dust to dust, ashes to ashes. But
[1:13:02] what's inside?
[1:13:05] God took something from existing
[1:13:07] materials to make a body, to form a
[1:13:10] body. But that's really not what the
[1:13:13] believer is. The believer has something
[1:13:16] that was that came not out of anything
[1:13:19] that exists.
[1:13:21] It came out of and there's something
[1:13:23] very very unique and wonderful here
[1:13:27] because it also has a a a meaning in the
[1:13:31] in the Hebrew uh word for image is it is
[1:13:37] as something that is has been cut off.
[1:13:40] not cut off or separated but something
[1:13:42] that is a part of something else. And so
[1:13:46] in the Hebrew when it talks about the
[1:13:49] image of God, it is something that has
[1:13:52] come off of an original piece, something
[1:13:55] that has been cut off. That is why the
[1:13:58] scripture speaks of Jesus that he came
[1:14:00] from the bosom of the father. He's come
[1:14:03] from the bosom of the father. We we saw
[1:14:06] and he there was a a body that was made
[1:14:12] and taken because he took a body of
[1:14:14] flesh and that body came from the
[1:14:19] existing materials.
[1:14:21] But with what was in him isn't something
[1:14:24] that came from anything that existed.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; He was God in the flesh. And we have to
[1:14:32] see that. And and I'd like to emphasize
[1:14:35] that because I would like you to ponder
[1:14:38] that because Apostle Paul is directing
[1:14:42] his words to the Colossians by saying
[1:14:46] that's the mystery that has been hidden.
[1:14:49] And I would say Satan has worked
[1:14:52] fulltime 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
[1:14:56] 365 a year to try to cloud that issue
[1:15:01] and try and take that out of the
[1:15:03] believer and try and and make that a
[1:15:07] confusion until he succeeds in having
[1:15:10] people to believe, ah, stay away from
[1:15:12] that because that's the first sign of a
[1:15:15] cult. I'll have you know if you don't
[1:15:17] believe that, you're lost.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that God by his
[1:15:22] spirit comes into you and makes you a
[1:15:25] son of God by the spirit of God and that
[1:15:28] God is in your flesh, you can you you
[1:15:31] can in no wise come into your
[1:15:34] inheritance.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that?
[1:15:40] Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; So God created man in his own image in
[1:15:46] the image of God created he him. So out
[1:15:50] of out of all God created and made man
[1:15:55] is both molded from existing material
[1:16:00] also created out of no known existing
[1:16:04] material.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:07] I'm glad to be able to stand here and
[1:16:09] say today, there's a part of me that
[1:16:11] didn't come from anything that man knows
[1:16:14] as a material. Nothing that's an
[1:16:16] existing material, the great spirit of
[1:16:19] God, eternal spirit of God has come to
[1:16:22] dwell in these earthn vessels.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what makes us
[1:16:27] really what we are.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; It is that spirit. It is that element.
[1:16:33] And I cannot understand it. I can't
[1:16:35] describe it to you. I don't know how it
[1:16:37] happens. But God, we baptize people in
[1:16:41] water in an element.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; We take these bodies of flesh which came
[1:16:46] out of the elements. That's the part
[1:16:48] that came from that which is uh- which
[1:16:52] is material which which existed. And we
[1:16:55] take that body and put it into that into
[1:16:58] the tank as as a representation that
[1:17:00] they're going down into a burial and
[1:17:03] they buried in the with Christ in his in
[1:17:06] his death. But when he raised in the
[1:17:08] resurrection, the life that was in
[1:17:11] Christ, you know, uh let me say it this
[1:17:14] way. the life that was in Christ while
[1:17:15] he walked on earth, while he suffered
[1:17:18] for sin and while he suffered in his
[1:17:20] humanity, but that that life that was in
[1:17:23] him, which was God in flesh. Will you
[1:17:26] agree with that?
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; That life took dominance
[1:17:30] because it was the spirit of God which
[1:17:32] raised him from the dead. So the spirit
[1:17:35] of God raised the material. What what
[1:17:38] the what was made a body in a woman came
[1:17:42] into the earth and was laid in the tomb.
[1:17:44] That body was not there when Peter went
[1:17:47] to the tomb.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; That body had raised
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; and the angel said, "Why seek ye the
[1:17:53] living among the dead? He has risen and
[1:17:56] that body was raised and changed." So
[1:17:59] that life that was in him was taking
[1:18:02] dominance over that body that was made
[1:18:04] out of the existing material.
[1:18:06] Hallelujah. And that which is in you
[1:18:09] which had no beginning and had no end,
[1:18:12] as sure as this Bible stands before us
[1:18:15] today, that life will take dominance
[1:18:17] over this one. Hallelujah. We have been
[1:18:21] cut off the great masterpiece. We're
[1:18:24] part of a great masterpiece. We've been
[1:18:26] broken off of that piece. Hallelujah. We
[1:18:29] came from God and we'll go back to God.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; In the future home, I love these quotes.
[1:18:40] You are part of the earth.
[1:18:43] Your body and your soul is a part of
[1:18:46] God.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; An attribute of God displayed here on
[1:18:51] earth in a body.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; And the body is to be redeemed. Now the
[1:18:57] soul's redeemed. It is redeemed now. You
[1:19:00] are redeemed
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; because it was in because it was in sin.
[1:19:06] So God came down by the process of
[1:19:09] justification and sanctification and the
[1:19:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed
[1:19:15] your soul and you being a part of the
[1:19:18] earth. That's where the material that
[1:19:20] existed. It's redeemed by it. You're in
[1:19:23] that. You're in the process now. It's
[1:19:26] going on. In other words, your body
[1:19:29] which came from existing materials is in
[1:19:32] the process of redemption. It's in the
[1:19:35] process that God has. But your soul has
[1:19:38] already your soul stepped ahead of the
[1:19:41] body. Your soul is already redeemed. We
[1:19:44] are redeemed.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Let the let the redeemed say
[1:19:48] so.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And don't be ashamed of it.
[1:19:55] Hallelujah.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; If anyone can rejoice, it's you that can
[1:19:59] rejoice. You're in the process now.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm in the process now.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture is telling us.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Image. Now, this is the Hebrew. Salem is
[1:20:17] the pronunciation. It is a likeness or a
[1:20:21] resemblance. Let us make man in our
[1:20:24] image. Let us make man in our likeness.
[1:20:27] Let him resemble us a piece of the
[1:20:30] original.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; You see, when God took him and formed
[1:20:36] even the body and brother Brandham
[1:20:38] speaks of God's a spirit. We were first
[1:20:42] a spirit man in our original state and
[1:20:46] then God breathed into that as Rabbi
[1:20:50] Richmond uh stood here and I think he
[1:20:53] thought he was going to shock the people
[1:20:55] by saying let me say that that breath
[1:20:59] that God breathed into man can never
[1:21:03] sin. And the congregation that was here,
[1:21:06] probably 8, 900 people that crowded
[1:21:09] night, all said in big unison, "Amen."
[1:21:13] They can never sin. How can the breath
[1:21:15] of God that's breathed into that never
[1:21:18] came from a substance?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. How can that ever sin? It
[1:21:23] can never sin. It came right out of the
[1:21:25] bosom of God, the breath of God. Do you
[1:21:28] know that this word came by the same
[1:21:30] process? This came by the breath of God.
[1:21:33] It came through man. God breathed
[1:21:36] through man. And when he breathed
[1:21:38] through man, it came out in word form.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; And that word was God.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; And the word was God. And that word was
[1:21:49] made what?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Flesh.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; And dwelt among us.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; It was the word in flesh. Hallelujah.
[1:21:56] And now the breath of God has breathed
[1:21:59] out the spoken word. And we have
[1:22:01] believed that word into our very being.
[1:22:05] And that that word is God.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; And he brings his spirit into that word
[1:22:10] to make it alive.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; It's not a lot of dos and don'ts. It's
[1:22:15] not a whole bunch of things that you do
[1:22:18] say, "Well, this how we dress or this is
[1:22:19] how we act." It's way beyond that.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; And that life, you have to have that
[1:22:25] life in you first. If you're having a
[1:22:27] struggle, if you're having a struggle
[1:22:29] with your conduct, let me say to you,
[1:22:32] whether it's young people or older,
[1:22:33] whoever you are, if you have a struggle
[1:22:34] with your conduct, you believe and let
[1:22:37] that life of God, you hunger after him
[1:22:40] and let that life of God take domination
[1:22:43] in you and those other things will drop
[1:22:45] away
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; like the man or even brother Brandham
[1:22:52] had. and he refrained from being
[1:22:55] baptized because he smoked.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about that. Get baptized and
[1:23:01] the smoke will drop off.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; The world will drop away.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and try to wrestle with
[1:23:07] it in your own strength. You haven't got
[1:23:09] the wisdom to handle it. You haven't got
[1:23:11] the strength to handle it. But go to
[1:23:14] death
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; and he'll die. Let the old man die.
[1:23:18] There's baptism tonight. If you've not
[1:23:20] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:23:22] Jesus Christ and come to the waters, be
[1:23:25] baptized and let the Holy Spirit because
[1:23:27] of your obedience come into you. Let
[1:23:30] that part that did not come from a
[1:23:32] material that didn't come from anything
[1:23:34] that existed. It come out of the out of
[1:23:37] the very bosom of God Almighty.
[1:23:40] Hallelujah.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; I want the congregation to say amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say second to this preacher.
[1:23:52] Hallelujah.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; A piece from the original. I love that.
[1:23:59] From the root word. Something that has
[1:24:02] been cut off. Something that has been
[1:24:04] designed from the um original
[1:24:07] masterpiece. And they the reason why
[1:24:10] it's cut off is a a man takes a stalk
[1:24:12] just a piece of wood, a tree, and he
[1:24:15] cuts a piece off. And from that peace,
[1:24:17] he shapes what? The image that's in his
[1:24:20] mind. Well, God had an image in his
[1:24:22] mind. I was praying for some healing
[1:24:25] this morning for some individuals and my
[1:24:28] prayer was this. God, the picture you
[1:24:32] had in your mind, surely I have a right
[1:24:35] to claim that picture,
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; that was your thought of that
[1:24:41] individual. And I claim that picture. I
[1:24:45] claim that image. I claim that icon for
[1:24:48] that individual.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; We certainly have a right for that. In
[1:24:58] the image in the Greek is the icon. A
[1:25:01] you fellas that run you girls that run
[1:25:05] computers is full of icons. You click on
[1:25:08] this icon and click an act. What is it?
[1:25:10] It's an image of something else. You
[1:25:12] click on it and then whatever whatever
[1:25:14] happens in the computer world but in the
[1:25:17] image in the Bible and he is the image
[1:25:21] of the invisible God. He's the icon
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; of the invisible God. I hope you don't
[1:25:28] think it's sacrilegious but the woman
[1:25:31] touched the icon
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; and her blood issue was dried up.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; She got the right touch
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; at the right person. and received what
[1:25:43] she had a need of faith. The prophet
[1:25:46] says, and we're going to get into it in
[1:25:48] a few moments, that this body which we
[1:25:50] have, which came out of the physical,
[1:25:54] material, existing part of the earth,
[1:25:57] oh my, I hope you can linger long enough
[1:26:02] and mentally allow your minds to reach
[1:26:05] out into the great unknown and vast and
[1:26:07] believe what God's prophet said.
[1:26:10] He said, "This old star, I call it, I
[1:26:13] got the quote later on. I may come to
[1:26:14] it. This earth, this old star, do you
[1:26:17] believe what I'm saying?
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:26:22] this old star that spun out there in a a
[1:26:26] great vast universe. He said maybe
[1:26:30] dropped spun out there for hundreds of
[1:26:34] millions or billions of years and
[1:26:37] spinning out there in space
[1:26:41] and stops and some gases form
[1:26:46] and then it then it maybe goes on
[1:26:48] another part of the journey. We can't we
[1:26:52] can't fully describe it. But yet you're
[1:26:54] sitting here and all of you know science
[1:26:56] declares to you that these universe was
[1:26:59] they think it's still expanding going
[1:27:02] out there and that there's billions of
[1:27:04] galaxies, billions of them. They they
[1:27:08] thought there was only three some years
[1:27:09] ago and now they can't even they can't
[1:27:12] even begin to grasp and man is
[1:27:14] struggling to try to understand this
[1:27:17] creation and this universe and this this
[1:27:21] great expanse of nothingness out there.
[1:27:24] And here we are. Here we are like a a a
[1:27:28] few worms of life
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; on one special globe. But a prophet
[1:27:33] comes says it's the womb for his seed.
[1:27:37] Who's going to dispute that? And here we
[1:27:39] are all living creatures and on an earth
[1:27:42] that's full of life and full of
[1:27:43] existence and everything else is vast
[1:27:46] waste, nothing. And God put one thing
[1:27:49] spinning here and a prophet come says it
[1:27:51] spun for maybe a hundred billion years
[1:27:54] and some gases formed and then it was
[1:27:57] wrapped around maybe the sun or whatever
[1:28:00] more for some more billions and billions
[1:28:02] of light years of space and some calcium
[1:28:05] formed. He said he was making you.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Now friends, I got something to say
[1:28:12] today. Two things right now. Number one,
[1:28:15] I believe that.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And number two, if that is so, you've
[1:28:21] been a long time coming.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; And some people have disregard for this
[1:28:25] body that they're in. And I would say if
[1:28:28] God had that in his mind for all those
[1:28:30] billions and billions of years, bringing
[1:28:33] you up to this place, his intent is to
[1:28:36] dwell in you somehow.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't bring your body here just to
[1:28:42] be a nothing,
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; just to be a waste wilderness, just to
[1:28:46] be something that the devil can entice
[1:28:48] people to pump full of all kinds of
[1:28:50] garbage and trash. That's why he say he
[1:28:52] that destroys a body, this temple is the
[1:28:55] body of the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; The amen's got quieter.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the food that you
[1:29:03] eat. That's up to you. But I'm saying
[1:29:05] one thing. You're here in the house of
[1:29:07] God. And I'm here to tell you that God
[1:29:10] gave you the body that you're that
[1:29:11] you're seated in today sitting here
[1:29:13] listening to this word because he want
[1:29:15] to dwell in it.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; He want to glorify himself in it. He
[1:29:20] wants to speak through it. He wants to
[1:29:22] look through your eyes. He wants to have
[1:29:24] complete dominance. He wants to have the
[1:29:26] preeminence in this body. He wants you
[1:29:29] to open your lips. He wants you to say,
[1:29:31] "Praise be to God."
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; He wants you to use these lungs. He
[1:29:38] wants you to use your strength. He wants
[1:29:40] you to see is there somebody I can
[1:29:41] serve? Is there somebody something I can
[1:29:44] do for God? And this is not a me me
[1:29:47] gospel. This is what can I do for
[1:29:50] someone else?
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; And you'll be criticized for it. I am.
[1:29:55] I'm criticized all the time, for trying
[1:29:58] to get the message out, trying to
[1:29:59] translate it into other tongues. I tell
[1:30:02] you one thing, there's a scripture I'm
[1:30:04] going to preach on it someday. I've been
[1:30:06] pondering it for a very long time. It's
[1:30:08] one of my favorites. And and they
[1:30:10] criticized a woman who poured out the
[1:30:13] alabaster box on Jesus. And they said,
[1:30:16] "What is this waste? To them it was a
[1:30:19] waste.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Don't trouble her."
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; And I love this phrase
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; for me. It's the phrase of the bride of
[1:30:27] Christ in this church. She hath done
[1:30:32] what she could.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; That touches me so deep.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; I have prayed when I cross over
[1:30:44] and I intend to see brother Brennham.
[1:30:48] I intend to see the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; I intend to be with you people
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; providing you intend to be there also
[1:30:57] and by his grace when I come to these
[1:31:00] that will be I'll be gathered and we'll
[1:31:02] be gathered to those that were gathered
[1:31:04] with who gave us this message gave us
[1:31:08] this uh abundance of spiritual food in
[1:31:11] due season.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; I want to just be able to say those
[1:31:14] words.
[1:31:16] and did what we could. We did what we
[1:31:19] could. That's what I want to be able to
[1:31:22] say. I lived the life that we could.
[1:31:25] Spent the energy and did what we could.
[1:31:28] I want Jesus to be able to say, "You did
[1:31:30] what you could.
[1:31:32] Leave her alone. She has done what she
[1:31:36] could."
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Those are precious words to me.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Precious words.
[1:31:47] And I'm prepared to do anything we can
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; to get the thing that has brought us to
[1:31:53] where we are
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; into somebody else's hands.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; I had the experience, again, doesn't
[1:32:00] happen all that often.
[1:32:03] Brother Tony was there, myself, two
[1:32:06] senior pastors,
[1:32:08] and they looked across that little table
[1:32:11] where we had had something to eat.
[1:32:14] And they said through their interpreter,
[1:32:17] young man, 27, same age I was when I met
[1:32:20] Brother Brandham,
[1:32:22] they said, "You speak English.
[1:32:26] You have the whole message.
[1:32:29] We don't have it.
[1:32:31] You've had all these experiences.
[1:32:34] You've been with the prophet. You've
[1:32:36] been with him. You've seen how he how he
[1:32:38] speaks and how he acts.
[1:32:40] And we want you to know that you're
[1:32:42] responsible.
[1:32:44] God gave you that. And they asked me,
[1:32:46] "Do you think that God gave you that?
[1:32:48] Why do you think God gave you that? Why
[1:32:50] do you think God allowed you to have
[1:32:52] those experiences?"
[1:32:54] And I was just quiet because quite
[1:32:57] frankly at my age, I just want to fade
[1:33:00] off into and be put out to pasture. They
[1:33:03] said, "You're responsible. We don't have
[1:33:06] that opportunity.
[1:33:07] We don't understand. we don't we don't
[1:33:09] have it. They were just like coming
[1:33:11] across the table. We don't have it in
[1:33:13] our language.
[1:33:15] Broke my heart.
[1:33:19] I was just
[1:33:21] I was about speechless, wasn't I,
[1:33:23] Brother Tony? I didn't say anything.
[1:33:25] Brother Tony never said hardly a word.
[1:33:30] That's why I can't sit here and just sit
[1:33:34] on our laurels and be coasting along and
[1:33:37] things are fine with me and I got a car
[1:33:40] and I got my job and I got my this and I
[1:33:42] got my that. That won't get us anywhere.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; And you maybe you say, "Well, I want to,
[1:33:52] you know, get out and do great things."
[1:33:53] I'll tell you one thing. when a
[1:33:55] congregation of people
[1:33:58] God Almighty has seen that thousands and
[1:34:02] tens of thousands and I don't care what
[1:34:04] people say well there aren't going to be
[1:34:05] great things that's not a that's not a
[1:34:08] statement that carries any weight with
[1:34:10] me I if we have it to cover the whole
[1:34:12] nation if we have to broadcast or or
[1:34:16] send out message books or do whatever we
[1:34:18] have to do to get one
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; I think it would be the greatest honor
[1:34:25] If we could rise at the great supper
[1:34:28] table and said Cloverdale by the way the
[1:34:31] saints there were so gripped so so uh uh
[1:34:35] yes gripped so possessed of this uh
[1:34:39] character and this nature they brought
[1:34:41] in the last one.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Bring in the last one.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Send out the word. Amen.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; I asked brother Dioa, "How do you get
[1:34:53] all these books out through the rich
[1:34:55] people?"
[1:34:57] No.
[1:34:58] He said, "Even the Sunday school
[1:35:00] children?" That was the first thing out
[1:35:01] of his lips. The Sunday school children
[1:35:04] just give a little bit and maybe give a
[1:35:07] book.
[1:35:09] What about you children? Have you ever
[1:35:11] thought of Brother Biscar ever speaks
[1:35:14] this way? Have you ever thought What
[1:35:15] about young people that go down to
[1:35:16] Starbucks and spend $4 or5? Have you
[1:35:18] ever thought what $4 or5 dollars will do
[1:35:20] in the in offering?
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Want to think about that? And you go the
[1:35:25] next day and the next day and the next
[1:35:27] day go to McDonald's $67. You don't
[1:35:29] think anything about it. Go out and fill
[1:35:30] your car full of gas $450 and you have a
[1:35:33] job. What do you think about? Say,
[1:35:34] "Well, I I pay my tithe." What about
[1:35:36] what about even something sacrificial?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; I'd like to bring those people to you
[1:35:42] and have them look into your eyes.
[1:35:46] I said, "You're lucky. You're so
[1:35:48] fortunate.
[1:35:50] You understand English.
[1:35:56] What? What grace?
[1:35:58] What what gift?
[1:36:00] What did you do to earn that
[1:36:04] you're able to speak that language?" And
[1:36:06] so, well, it just
[1:36:10] comes so easy.
[1:36:14] We're indebted.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; We're indebted.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; And I can only do more
[1:36:22] I can only do more than we're doing
[1:36:24] right now.
[1:36:30] My wife was worried for me
[1:36:36] because the airlines and the air airport
[1:36:40] controllers had some kind of dispute and
[1:36:43] concern struggle with the government. So
[1:36:46] I I sat in two airports for 17 hours.
[1:36:51] I wasn't even going to mention it. Do
[1:36:53] you know why it's not worth mentioning?
[1:36:56] not worth mentioning. It's absolutely
[1:36:58] nothing for me. It's absolutely nothing.
[1:37:00] Sit there 17 hours, that's nothing.
[1:37:03] We're able to go and tell and see
[1:37:05] somebody and hold their hand and say,
[1:37:08] you know, we'll do what we can. You
[1:37:10] think of the energy that's expended.
[1:37:12] Then, Brother Tony wanted to come home
[1:37:14] with me real bad. I knew he did, but
[1:37:17] there was things that were needed. And I
[1:37:19] tell you, you you you should have seen
[1:37:21] the panic that was on to try to get to
[1:37:24] another place. And here our plane is
[1:37:27] late coming into Rio and he needs to go
[1:37:30] to another city, Kiba.
[1:37:33] And there's a kind of a lastm minute
[1:37:35] thing.
[1:37:38] And so he gets his flight rearranged,
[1:37:40] etc., etc. But now the flight's late and
[1:37:42] he knows for sure his bag won't get on
[1:37:44] that flight and he's only there for 24
[1:37:46] hours and he's on his way back home. But
[1:37:49] he imperative to be down there.
[1:37:54] So he called and got a man that could
[1:37:56] speak English, a steward on the plane
[1:37:59] said, you know, I'm going to Kachiba. My
[1:38:04] my bag my bag is on this plane. And the
[1:38:07] man says, "I'll I'll I'll see you as we
[1:38:10] land and I'll go with you and we'll get
[1:38:12] the bag transferred over over to the
[1:38:14] other gate." And that man came up. He
[1:38:16] was so accommodating and so nice and
[1:38:18] came up and had his radio, whatever more
[1:38:21] off the plane with brother Tony. as I
[1:38:23] walked off the plane going to my gate
[1:38:25] there, brother Tony with the people and
[1:38:27] they're, you know, they got some ground
[1:38:29] staff there and they're letting the
[1:38:30] people know, get this bag and get it on
[1:38:33] the down the other gate so it can go to
[1:38:36] Kiba
[1:38:39] and I have to go and get my bag and
[1:38:41] recheck it again. And you don't hardly
[1:38:43] have anybody can speak your language,
[1:38:45] I'll tell you really in a difficult
[1:38:47] place. And I was uh standing there and
[1:38:51] everybody's bag went off went off and
[1:38:54] finally only me and two other young
[1:38:56] fellas standing there and my bag wasn't
[1:38:59] coming off and I said I bowed my head
[1:39:03] and I said, "Lord Jesus,
[1:39:06] let my bag come off this plane. Let my
[1:39:09] bag come down on this carousel." And
[1:39:13] just a couple of moments here come my
[1:39:16] bag out. I said, 'Oh, praise the Lord.'
[1:39:18] And I looked at one. I thought I
[1:39:20] recognized it behind it was Brother
[1:39:21] Tony's.
[1:39:23] This bag's supposed to be another gate,
[1:39:25] supposed to be in a domestic, supposed
[1:39:26] to go to another place. And I thought,
[1:39:29] surely that's not brother Tony's. I
[1:39:31] grabbed it and I ran along and looked at
[1:39:33] the tag, Anthony Abma. I said, "Oh my
[1:39:36] goodness. Now, what do we do?"
[1:39:42] You
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; might say, "What has this got to do with
[1:39:44] the gospel?" This is part of the gospel.
[1:39:47] Paul told you about being shipwrecked.
[1:39:49] He told you about going to an island.
[1:39:50] Told you about a bug that came out on
[1:39:52] his flesh and put it in the fire. Told
[1:39:54] you about all kinds of things. How long
[1:39:55] he was there.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Told you all kinds of difficulties that
[1:40:00] he went through. These are just some of
[1:40:01] the difficulties. Do you do you en do
[1:40:04] you enjoy it? Well, no, but you don't
[1:40:05] mind it either because it's all part of
[1:40:07] the gospel. It's part of getting it out.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And there's no staff. And just at that
[1:40:13] same instant, I see a fellow from the
[1:40:15] airline that I came off of going across.
[1:40:18] And I went and got a hold of him. I
[1:40:20] said, "Do you speak English?"
[1:40:24] I said, "This bag is supposed to go to
[1:40:27] Kibba." This bag. Oh, okay. You go to
[1:40:30] Kiba. No, no, no, no. I'm not going. My
[1:40:34] friend is going. I said, "My colleague."
[1:40:36] He didn't understand. My friend, my
[1:40:38] friend, this bag is my bag. This bag's
[1:40:41] my friend's bag has to go to Kachiba.
[1:40:45] Okay. Gets on his radio and next day
[1:40:49] Tony called me said, "Did you get your
[1:40:50] bag?" "Oh, yeah." I said, "Just work
[1:40:52] perfect." He says, "Those people were so
[1:40:54] accommodating. It was just wonderful." I
[1:40:56] said, "That they were accommodating, but
[1:40:58] that isn't how your bag got there."
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:04] That's all part of getting the gospel
[1:41:06] and doing what you don't want to do and
[1:41:09] going someplace maybe you don't want to.
[1:41:10] I want to go home. I want to be with my
[1:41:12] wife. I want to do. But the gospel
[1:41:14] calls.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The burden calls.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; A lot of people today coming up to this
[1:41:25] Christmas season are going to get caught
[1:41:26] up in a pagan holiday. They're going to
[1:41:28] spend a whole lot more money than they
[1:41:30] should. going to be left with credit
[1:41:32] card bills at the end that they they
[1:41:34] said it's such a such a sad state of
[1:41:36] affairs. I I look at them all and I feel
[1:41:39] sorry for the people are being torn to
[1:41:41] all to shreds running all over the place
[1:41:43] getting this stuff. I tell you what, I
[1:41:45] think one of the finest things a person
[1:41:46] could do is give somebody you want to
[1:41:48] give somebody a gift. Say, I sent a 100
[1:41:51] church agents out for you.
[1:41:59] Well, I'm off my subject, but and yet
[1:42:02] I'm not off my subject.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; How are they going to be made? How are
[1:42:07] they going to be formed? How are these
[1:42:09] people going to be formed into the image
[1:42:11] of God? And some sit back. I've heard
[1:42:14] comments
[1:42:16] from supposed to be real deep message
[1:42:19] believers
[1:42:22] and are just so happy they got MP3s and
[1:42:25] they got this kind of book and that kind
[1:42:26] of book and they got walls lined with it
[1:42:29] and we say, "Well, what about those?"
[1:42:31] Well, even if they just got one, that'll
[1:42:32] be enough.
[1:42:34] Can you imagine that kind of statement?
[1:42:35] Even if they just got one, that'll be
[1:42:37] enough.
[1:42:39] And I thank God that since the thing was
[1:42:42] set up in Brazil, that's 190 million
[1:42:46] people in Brazil, friends. 190 million
[1:42:49] people. It's a moving country. It's a
[1:42:53] vast, vast nation. And I wouldn't even
[1:42:56] be talking say, "Why are you talking
[1:42:58] about Brazil?" Because God opens the
[1:42:59] door
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; and God put people together. I didn't do
[1:43:03] that. I didn't even know these people.
[1:43:06] Never heard their name.
[1:43:08] until and they lay hold of you. Now
[1:43:11] listen, it it's not me as an individual.
[1:43:14] They're they're holding on to you.
[1:43:16] They're seeing you. They've seen you on
[1:43:18] the internet and they know people's
[1:43:20] names, those who come up and pray and
[1:43:23] those who preach. And I got an email the
[1:43:25] other day from Switzerland and listed
[1:43:27] everybody that preaches. for brother
[1:43:30] John Adney and brother Tony Abma and
[1:43:33] brother Lance Laroo and brother Dier and
[1:43:36] brother Tom Ray and brother Ed Biscll
[1:43:38] and even I think some others on there.
[1:43:40] Thank them for me. Thank the
[1:43:42] congregation. We are believers over
[1:43:44] here. They don't have a church but we
[1:43:46] sit and we've been listening for the
[1:43:47] last year and a half.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; You think I should be silent? I can't be
[1:43:57] silent. This thing isn't in my mouth.
[1:43:59] It's in my soul. It's in my very bosom.
[1:44:02] It's in my every fiber of my body.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I've tried to give an
[1:44:08] example to this people, to this
[1:44:10] congregation. And we This is a whole
[1:44:14] nature of the gospel. If we got time for
[1:44:17] other things, we got time for God. We
[1:44:20] got money for other things, we got money
[1:44:22] for God. What about sacrifice?
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; For whom he did know. Now, here's some
[1:44:37] scriptures that I'm going to give you.
[1:44:39] For whom he did know? He also did
[1:44:41] predestinate to be I'd like the
[1:44:45] congregation to say it. Conformed to the
[1:44:48] image of his son. What did he do? He
[1:44:51] predestinated that. He determined that.
[1:44:54] When did he determine that? When this
[1:44:56] old star was spinning off billions of
[1:45:00] light years of space, creating a little
[1:45:03] bit of a a little bit of uh potach or or
[1:45:07] something else to say, well, that's way
[1:45:08] beyond my mind. It's not beyond God's
[1:45:11] mind. That's what he did. And he was and
[1:45:13] he had in his mind then you as an
[1:45:16] individual. Brother Brandham says one
[1:45:18] place that you're not only a thought,
[1:45:20] but he says he he had to create the
[1:45:22] thought.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say you are a long time coming
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; friends and I believe that about every
[1:45:28] one of you. If you have the if you have
[1:45:31] the courage to believe I am that son of
[1:45:33] God. I am that daughter of God. I have
[1:45:36] the courage to believe along with you. I
[1:45:38] say God bless you brother Vile. God
[1:45:40] bless you brother Dan. God bless you
[1:45:43] sisters. God bless you in the name of
[1:45:45] Jesus Christ. I'd like to go off the
[1:45:47] scene saying God bless you.
[1:45:53] God ordained that you would be the image
[1:45:55] of Jesus Christ here on earth.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; But we all with open face beholding as
[1:46:05] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[1:46:09] changed. You believe that?
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; We're changed.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; You might not see it. You maybe don't
[1:46:15] feel it. And I suppose you don't. I
[1:46:17] don't perhaps maybe feel it at your
[1:46:20] weakest moment. That's not what the
[1:46:22] scripture says. The scripture doesn't
[1:46:24] say you're changed if you feel it.
[1:46:27] You're changed if everything's going all
[1:46:28] right. You're changed if you feel
[1:46:30] upbeat. You're changed if you're of a
[1:46:32] positive nature. Has nothing to do with
[1:46:35] that. You are changed from glory to
[1:46:38] glory.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That's the word of God.
[1:46:43] The breath of God is speaking. Friends,
[1:46:46] I'm speaking this word.
[1:46:50] This is the breath of God
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; to you whether you want to receive it or
[1:46:54] not.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; You're changed into what?
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Same image.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Let everyone who believes it say it.
[1:47:05] Same image.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Whose image?
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; The very image of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; He was the icon
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; of God. And you are his icon.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; You are his image.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; You're the icon of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:28] This word is either true or it's a lie.
[1:47:31] I say it is true.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of a day you had
[1:47:35] yesterday, what kind of a week you had
[1:47:37] last week.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; And as you believe it and as you see it
[1:47:41] and as you as you walk in it, friends,
[1:47:43] it will change how you walk.
[1:47:47] Some of you have been I know you have
[1:47:49] you've been trying to change yourself.
[1:47:51] You've been trying to make make yourself
[1:47:53] into that image. You can never come into
[1:47:54] that image. You have no strength. You
[1:47:57] have no ability. You haven't got enough
[1:47:59] will. You don't have enough
[1:48:00] determination. It's God's will.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; According to his will.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to take a few more
[1:48:13] minutes.
[1:48:16] I stepped up here at 11:30 and I'm going
[1:48:18] to close at 12:30.
[1:48:23] We're changed
[1:48:27] into the same image.
[1:48:32] Notice these out of the future home.
[1:48:35] Remember that the Holy Ghost descended
[1:48:37] on Jesus which was a part of the earth.
[1:48:41] Why? The germ of God, the life of God
[1:48:46] was designed in the womb of a woman,
[1:48:49] which was the earth. The woman was the
[1:48:52] earth. Oh, I'd like you to see if you
[1:48:54] could just please give me your whole
[1:48:56] attention for the next few minutes. As
[1:48:59] we're coming to a close,
[1:49:02] this earth that God allowed to this old
[1:49:06] star he allowed to spin off into space.
[1:49:10] He had in his mind that he create
[1:49:13] certain elements, certain substances. He
[1:49:17] knew what he was going to do. And out of
[1:49:19] those substances which laid in the earth
[1:49:22] for maybe hundreds of billions of years
[1:49:25] and he knew there'd be a great war, a
[1:49:28] great conflict. And who who knows when
[1:49:30] Lucifer was created? I don't know. But
[1:49:33] he was created and he raised up and he
[1:49:35] said, "I'll ascend." He wanted to get a
[1:49:38] position that was not his position and
[1:49:40] was cast out to the earth.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; When I don't know, but he ended up in
[1:49:46] Eden. But here out of the earth, God is
[1:49:50] taking these elements and he he brings
[1:49:52] forth a man and he's he's Adam, the
[1:49:57] first Adam, a son of God.
[1:50:02] But before he was even formed out of the
[1:50:05] element of the earth, God had brought
[1:50:07] forth out of himself cut off a piece as
[1:50:10] it were and made this piece God of the
[1:50:15] earth.
[1:50:17] out of non-existent materials and then
[1:50:20] took the existing materials and breathed
[1:50:23] into it. And from that piece came
[1:50:27] another piece, a woman. And through that
[1:50:31] the fall and the sin and the earth, this
[1:50:35] earth spinning in space as it were lost.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; And God begins redemption.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; And he testifies to redemption. And he
[1:50:47] brings a imagine God I don't know how he
[1:50:50] did it but he brought a bloody skin. God
[1:50:53] what form he took I do not know but God
[1:50:56] dressed them.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; God put bloody skins on them.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Oh I'd like to take time and give the
[1:51:03] drama that the prophet gives and how
[1:51:05] Adam uh and walking in that slapping
[1:51:09] sound of the hide and the skin bleeding
[1:51:12] and the blood running down his body. And
[1:51:15] for the first time, Eve puts her head
[1:51:18] over on Adam's shoulder and the tears
[1:51:21] begin to come. He said, "Now they can
[1:51:24] cry. They can cry now they couldn't
[1:51:27] before. They find within them an emotion
[1:51:30] they didn't have, didn't know they had,
[1:51:32] but now they're separated from God. And
[1:51:35] it creates another emotion. And God is
[1:51:38] already, he's already declaring, I'm
[1:51:41] going to redeem it. I'm going to settle
[1:51:43] this conflict. I'm going to defeat my
[1:51:46] enemy. Hallelujah. And he brings up
[1:51:50] people people's from the earth and they
[1:51:52] die. People, prophets come and they die
[1:51:55] and the and and Israel has great
[1:51:57] victories and they think, "Oh, maybe
[1:51:59] this is the answer." But the people die.
[1:52:01] The leaders die and they pass off the
[1:52:03] scene in the passing parade of humanity
[1:52:07] until a little girl could have been one
[1:52:09] of you young ladies here, a young girl
[1:52:11] 15 years old and uh she has a
[1:52:14] visitation, a supernatural visitation by
[1:52:17] an angel and the Virgin Mary said, "Let
[1:52:21] let it be unto me according to thy
[1:52:23] word." Amen.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; I heard a Jewish man speaking a few days
[1:52:27] ago and he he doesn't believe in
[1:52:29] Christianity, but he mentions the Virgin
[1:52:31] Mary and he spoke about Moses and spoke
[1:52:34] about the Virgin Mary and he says, "God,
[1:52:37] can he be God if he doesn't have someone
[1:52:40] that makes him God?" And I thought it
[1:52:42] was a profound statement. He said,
[1:52:44] "Moses," at the burning bush, the voice
[1:52:47] said, "I am." But Moses believed it and
[1:52:50] he made him God to the people. And Mary,
[1:52:54] he said, Mary made him God when she
[1:52:57] said, "Uh, be it unto me according to
[1:52:59] thy word." I thought it was a profound
[1:53:01] statement. And you people, God has sent
[1:53:04] you a word. You have to make him God
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; by believing what he said.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can never be the image of
[1:53:17] God unless we believe it and stake our
[1:53:20] claim on it and stay with it.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Make him God.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; And now, can you see with me? I'm not
[1:53:32] soon done, but listen. And here's this
[1:53:36] young girl.
[1:53:39] Brother Bren says perhaps 15 years old,
[1:53:41] young girl.
[1:53:43] She came when when all this humanity is
[1:53:45] coming. All God sees is a passing parade
[1:53:49] of the earth.
[1:53:51] The earth. The cursed earth. Cuz he
[1:53:54] cursed the earth. And these bodies came
[1:53:56] out of the earth.
[1:54:00] But here comes a girl. She's like any
[1:54:03] other girl
[1:54:05] and she's part of the soil.
[1:54:13] And God infuses her with a divine seed.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; And that seed is resting in a womb of
[1:54:21] the earth
[1:54:23] who came out of his womb of the earth.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Because through that he's going to
[1:54:28] commence another creation.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Out of the earth. He's going to bring
[1:54:32] this creation and redeem the earth.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, to me it's glorious.
[1:54:40] You certainly don't think that is
[1:54:41] getting way off someplace.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; That is marvelous.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; And he he he begins a new creation. And
[1:54:48] that is why Jesus could come to the
[1:54:50] Apostle John in the book of Revelation.
[1:54:52] I am the beginning of the creation of
[1:54:55] God,
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; a new creation. And we are not part of
[1:55:00] an old image. We're part of that image.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; We're an icon of that life.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "Because I live,
[1:55:08] you live also." That's the icon.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He that believeth on me
[1:55:13] shall never die.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; And that is why brother Brandham, we
[1:55:21] speak a lot about him. But I can tell
[1:55:23] you that is why that is why he made
[1:55:26] statements that was way out there,
[1:55:29] way out into another realm. It it is
[1:55:32] like I thought of it this morning. It is
[1:55:34] as though that that unseen realm was
[1:55:38] coming into him and through him by a
[1:55:42] process of osmosis. He knew it was
[1:55:45] there. He knew the position and he'd be
[1:55:47] in the unseen realm. He'd be in this
[1:55:49] realm. He'd be in the unseen. Be in the
[1:55:51] visible. Be in the realm of the material
[1:55:54] elements and be in the realm of the
[1:55:55] supernatural.
[1:55:57] Friends, that's never happened.
[1:56:00] No generation has received a ministry
[1:56:02] like that since Adam.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Show me one.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; No, we are the people.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to speak to you, Lord
[1:56:11] willing, on representation. We have been
[1:56:13] brought under that representation.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; You don't have to do all those things.
[1:56:18] The disciples didn't do everything Jesus
[1:56:20] did. The disciples are mentioned that
[1:56:22] never been mentioned again in the Bible,
[1:56:24] but they were identified.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; And you are sitting here today. I want
[1:56:29] to tell you, you're sitting here today
[1:56:31] identified with something God did in
[1:56:34] this generation.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; God has identified you. He's stamped
[1:56:39] you. He's marked you as being part of
[1:56:42] those that are gathered by this voice.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Well, there's no place for me to stop,
[1:56:48] so I've just got to stop. That's all
[1:56:50] there is to it.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; I thought maybe I can bring this to you.
[1:56:59] You're nice.
[1:57:02] Maybe you can put the lights up a wee
[1:57:03] bit. I'll go on with the other slides.
[1:57:08] I I I use some descriptive words. Try to
[1:57:12] capture your imagination
[1:57:15] because it takes more than imagination
[1:57:17] to even get a hold of God.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; We think of them and you talk about
[1:57:20] those hundreds and hundreds and billions
[1:57:22] and trillions of light years of space.
[1:57:25] Well, we just lose it. But but
[1:57:29] he said he was making you.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; But then when he formed Adam
[1:57:36] out of something that had been taken
[1:57:37] billions of years of coming, when he
[1:57:39] formed him,
[1:57:41] he just breathed into him. That was just
[1:57:43] a a moment, a spark, and there it was.
[1:57:46] And man became a living soul. See, God
[1:57:48] can take and it maybe takes centuries
[1:57:50] and centuries and centuries. And
[1:57:53] finally, you know, he has a people on
[1:57:54] the earth. What is he doing? He's in
[1:57:56] with a plan of redemption. And he's got
[1:57:58] a people on the earth. And it has been
[1:58:01] centuries and centuries from Adam,
[1:58:03] centuries and centuries to Moses. And
[1:58:06] then then God moves. Bang. So quickly,
[1:58:10] so suddenly. And there it is.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; And he's got a prophet. He's going
[1:58:15] before Pharaoh saying, "Let my people
[1:58:17] go." And then it goes hundreds and
[1:58:21] hundreds and hundreds of years and wars
[1:58:23] and rumors of wars and fightings and all
[1:58:25] of the thing Egypt into Babylon and
[1:58:28] bondage and so on finally and then just
[1:58:32] like that and here's Jesus on earth
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; and just a little we sliver of time and
[1:58:39] he's gone.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; And the people now what do we do? We had
[1:58:45] him. Now he's gone.
[1:58:49] But they followed the word and there
[1:58:50] were 120 of them in the upper room
[1:58:53] waiting waiting waiting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
[1:58:57] 9 10 days and the Bible says and
[1:58:59] suddenly
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; that those clumps of clay that have been
[1:59:05] coming for hundreds of billions of light
[1:59:07] years yet now God is not going to take
[1:59:09] billions of light years suddenly there
[1:59:12] come a rushing mighty wind and they were
[1:59:14] all filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:59:17] and so filled they were like drunk men,
[1:59:20] drunk women staggered out onto the
[1:59:21] street uttering in other languages.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Not a lot of the tongues that people
[1:59:27] think of today in in the realm of
[1:59:29] Pentecost, the Bible says, "How hear we
[1:59:31] every man in our own tongue."
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; They heard languages
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; and they heard the people glorifying
[1:59:40] God.
[1:59:42] That's the word of God.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; And that's what I stand on.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; And it came suddenly. Now, been hundreds
[1:59:52] of years, hundreds of years, 2,000 years
[1:59:55] goes by and the war and the world
[1:59:58] becomes educated and sophisticated and
[2:00:02] and developed and cultured and
[2:00:04] cultivated and scientific and
[2:00:07] industrialized and start to almost like
[2:00:10] break into God's laboratory.
[2:00:13] And they are
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; and suddenly
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; suddenly comes a ministry on the scene.
[2:00:21] Suddenly supernatural begins to happen.
[2:00:23] And the people are in bewilderment.
[2:00:25] Where' this come from? And before they
[2:00:27] can even before they can even grapple
[2:00:29] with it, seven mighty angels.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in a split.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? God can take 2,000
[2:00:39] years if he wants to and he can take one
[2:00:41] breath of a second.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; In the next and in a split they came.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; That which has been sealed up. That
[2:00:50] which has been sealed like the Apostle
[2:00:52] Paul, that which has been hidden from
[2:00:54] ages and generations is now made known
[2:00:58] to the people and made manifest to the
[2:01:00] people.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; And you're the people.
[2:01:05] Hallelujah.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; You're the people.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; You're not of another age. You're not of
[2:01:11] another generation. You're the people.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; You're not from Luther's time. You're
[2:01:16] here now.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; You all ought to be consumed with it.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; You all, I don't care how quiet. I don't
[2:01:25] care how reserved you are. You ought to
[2:01:27] be something something inside your
[2:01:29] heart. Your soul heart ought to be
[2:01:31] beating. Say, "Oh, God. Oh God, I
[2:01:34] believe that.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; I thought too.
[2:01:46] We hear son of man. Son of man. Son of
[2:01:48] man. He also was the son of God's mind.
[2:01:52] He was the son of mind. The son of God's
[2:01:55] thoughts
[2:01:56] that came and has made known to us. our
[2:01:59] Lord Jesus Christ reveal himself to you
[2:02:03] as his bride.
[2:02:05] God bless you.
[2:02:07] I want you to go with these thoughts in
[2:02:10] your heart and mind, Lord willing,
[2:02:12] perhaps even
[2:02:14] Wednesday or for sure next Sunday, only
[2:02:17] one service Sunday morning. Next Sunday,
[2:02:20] December 24th
[2:02:23] and evening you'll be with families.
[2:02:25] Many of you I trust you'll be a mighty
[2:02:28] testimony. Let's stand to our feet,
[2:02:31] shall we?
[2:02:38] Almighty God,
[2:02:41] our divine father.
[2:02:44] How lovely and personal you are.
[2:02:48] I think of the songwriter's words, "My
[2:02:51] heart is stirred
[2:02:53] when air I think of Jesus."
[2:02:56] My heart is stirred at your presence
[2:02:58] this morning. My heart is stirred, oh
[2:03:02] God, that you have considered us
[2:03:07] worthy.
[2:03:08] You've made us worthy somehow.
[2:03:11] But you considered us, Lord, to be
[2:03:15] called and to be given some
[2:03:19] uh position
[2:03:22] so that we could have and know your
[2:03:24] voice.
[2:03:26] And I would say, Lord, for most of this
[2:03:29] congregation, I speak for them today. I
[2:03:31] do not know everyone's heart, but I do
[2:03:34] know, Lord, that you've called them.
[2:03:36] That's why they're here. And as we
[2:03:38] dedicated our brother Chetameir and
[2:03:40] sister Danka
[2:03:42] and their family, I thought of how far
[2:03:45] they have journeyed.
[2:03:47] But now I look across this audience and
[2:03:50] see those that have journeyed, oh God.
[2:03:53] And we've come a long ways in these
[2:03:55] 30ome years. We've journeyied and we've
[2:03:58] seen a lot of things take place. and
[2:04:01] we've seen those that have gone on to
[2:04:05] courageous victories
[2:04:07] and have been strengthened in the might
[2:04:10] of God. I thank you for this
[2:04:12] congregation of people and I pray with
[2:04:16] everything that is in me that you will
[2:04:18] endure them with a mighty sweep of the
[2:04:21] Holy Spirit. I pray, oh God, you'll take
[2:04:26] this congregation and allow the voice of
[2:04:29] this word to be uttered and to be heard
[2:04:34] around the globe. Father, you see our
[2:04:37] heart. We desire no position. We desire
[2:04:41] no recognition. We desire no uh kingdom
[2:04:46] of our own. We desire your kingdom to be
[2:04:50] established in the hearts of the people.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Father,
[2:04:56] prepare the people for the service
[2:04:57] tonight as our brother John Andy's will
[2:04:59] come ministering you Lord your word and
[2:05:03] those that'll be baptized. And I pray
[2:05:06] Lord if there's any here that are yet in
[2:05:09] a condition of unbelief
[2:05:12] that they will be ashamed as your
[2:05:14] prophet said be ashamed of that. and
[2:05:17] he'll turn from that and he'll say,
[2:05:19] "Lord Jesus, you're too lovely. You're
[2:05:21] too wonderful.
[2:05:22] I forgive me. I'm sorry for doubting
[2:05:24] your word. Forgive me and draw me to
[2:05:27] yourself." If you're in that state and
[2:05:29] you just desire that prayer, you can
[2:05:32] raise your hand at least open your
[2:05:34] heart, lift up your heart to him. And do
[2:05:37] not be ashamed at this time of your
[2:05:39] need. People who got anything from God
[2:05:42] always were open about it. They would
[2:05:45] call with a loud voice if necessary and
[2:05:48] come running if necessary.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. Don't let Satan rob you
[2:05:52] now in
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, you can
[2:05:56] have no hold on these people that need
[2:05:59] you at this time. They need our Lord
[2:06:01] Jesus Christ. Lord, they need you. I
[2:06:05] pray, Father, that you'll do mighty
[2:06:07] things amongst us and prepare us, oh
[2:06:10] God, for the inevitable rapture and
[2:06:14] catching away of the church in Jesus
[2:06:17] Christ's name. And finally, Lord, I ask
[2:06:20] one last thing
[2:06:24] that you will put upon the people,
[2:06:29] especially those that have very little
[2:06:32] understanding.
[2:06:34] Would you reveal yourself to them
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name? Amen.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Man, let can I sing? This is your house.
[2:06:44] You all lift it up if you would, please.
[2:06:48] Maybe brother Rod, you could help me.
[2:06:51] This is your
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:07:03] This is your house.
[2:07:20] Bring their burdens and their car.
[2:07:25] This is your house.
[2:07:31] This is your house.
[2:07:35] Oh, come and
[2:07:42] is your
[2:07:47] father.
[2:07:51] Oh, this is your house.
[2:08:09] Bring their burdens.
[2:08:13] This is your house.
[2:08:16] This is your house, Lord. This is your
[2:08:24] God. And
[2:08:30] I'd like every person
[2:08:33] to hear what I have to say now because
[2:08:34] this is brother Ed Biscll and I'm
[2:08:37] placing a challenge out before you.
[2:08:42] When you sing these words,
[2:08:44] I want you in all truth from the very
[2:08:47] depths of your soul to be able to say,
[2:08:50] "Father,
[2:08:53] this is your house."
[2:08:57] And you
[2:08:59] are entirely free to come and dwell
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; and have full control. How many will
[2:09:06] raise their hand and say, "I that's what
[2:09:07] I desire.
[2:09:14] And for those of you that couldn't raise
[2:09:15] your hand, I want to say this to you.
[2:09:20] You're going to cross into another
[2:09:22] region someday.
[2:09:24] And what are you going to do if this
[2:09:26] wasn't his house? Where are you going to
[2:09:29] be if this was not his house?
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Where do you plan to go? what is the
[2:09:37] direction that you go? And God will have
[2:09:42] people stand before him and you'll see
[2:09:44] this service all over again. And you'll
[2:09:46] see a preacher up here in his latter
[2:09:49] years
[2:09:51] begging as it were the people bringing
[2:09:54] the gospel in the clearest terms that I
[2:09:56] can.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Spending hours before God in a weary
[2:10:01] body so I can bring this word today.
[2:10:05] God's going to hold you accountable for
[2:10:06] that. Say, "Why didn't you raise your
[2:10:08] hand? Why didn't you call for me? Why
[2:10:11] didn't you make me go of your life?"
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; This doctor that brother Tony
[2:10:26] stood beside,
[2:10:28] a tall, large,
[2:10:30] dignified man. I had never met him. I
[2:10:33] never shook his hand. But I noticed over
[2:10:35] here sitting while amongst maybe
[2:10:38] probably 1,200 people I noticed this man
[2:10:47] and he was listening so intently. I
[2:10:49] believe it must have been his wife
[2:10:50] sitting beside him about your size,
[2:10:53] brother West Niggard. That's why I was
[2:10:55] looking at you. He stood out amongst the
[2:10:58] people
[2:11:02] and then the pastor got up
[2:11:05] and begin to say to the people just like
[2:11:09] I'm standing here now
[2:11:12] who is going to be baptized
[2:11:14] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:11:17] And there was no movement just for a
[2:11:19] moment. He just stood there.
[2:11:23] Here comes a man
[2:11:25] and senior adults,
[2:11:28] no children, no emotion. And here they
[2:11:31] began to come upstep this doctor moved
[2:11:35] out of his seat. People unabashedly not
[2:11:39] ashamed walked forward. 17 lined up
[2:11:44] across the front. I tell you what,
[2:11:46] friends, it was very touching. You could
[2:11:49] see they were making a deep, deep
[2:11:51] decision. this wasn't light,
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Perhaps many of them Catholic and now
[2:11:58] they come and move forward in front of
[2:12:00] that audience.
[2:12:02] We're going to be baptized. And do you
[2:12:03] know what? Every one of the 17 were
[2:12:06] baptized.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Not one changed their mind from the
[2:12:10] service to the baptism in the afternoon.
[2:12:13] Everyone was baptized. Hallelujah. And I
[2:12:16] can tell you there's probably many, many
[2:12:18] more that wish they were there. You have
[2:12:20] a wonderful opportunity. They had a
[2:12:21] wonderful opportunity. I say close this
[2:12:24] service today making a rededication as
[2:12:27] brother Chadameir, Sister Dusanka did, a
[2:12:29] rededication. Oh God, this is your
[2:12:32] house.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; And then we'll close. And brother West
[2:12:36] Nygard, I'm going to have you come up
[2:12:37] and close in prayer. We'll sing it.
[2:12:39] Brother Rod.
[2:12:41] Sing it everyone.
[2:12:54] This is your
[2:13:00] holy house.
[2:13:16] our house.
[2:13:20] This is our
[2:13:31] last.
[2:13:41] This is your
[2:13:44] father. This is your
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; I just can't let go.
[2:13:57] Somebody lost
[2:14:00] and you're so alone.
[2:14:03] You're out there in a confused state. A
[2:14:06] man of God is going to come in a few
[2:14:08] moments and pray. We're not going to
[2:14:10] pray to close the service of such and to
[2:14:13] pray that God will continue to move and
[2:14:16] work in people's lives long after
[2:14:17] they've left these doors. When you leave
[2:14:20] these doors, you'll not leave this
[2:14:22] presence cuz he, the one I preach, will
[2:14:25] be with you, going to go with you where
[2:14:28] the lost and the lonely
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; can leave their burdens and their cares.
[2:14:35] And the only way that can happen is by
[2:14:38] you saying this is your house.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Come father and dwell.
[2:14:46] This is your house.
[2:14:51] Oh father.
[2:14:58] This is your house.
[2:15:04] It's a holy house of prayer
[2:15:10] where the lost.
[2:15:15] Bring their burdens and their cares.
[2:15:20] This is your
[2:15:25] Lord. This is your
[2:15:35] brother. Let's bow our heads.
[2:15:43] Let's bow our heads.
[2:15:47] Heavenly Father,
[2:15:51] we are a blessed people to hear your
[2:15:53] word.
[2:15:56] Lord God, there's not a one of us that's
[2:15:57] here by accident.
[2:16:00] As brother Ed said, eons of time you
[2:16:03] thought about us, Lord God. We were
[2:16:04] there with you in your thoughts. Father
[2:16:07] God, here we are, December 2006. Many of
[2:16:10] us never thought we'd get to this time,
[2:16:12] Father God. But Lord God, you saw a fit
[2:16:16] to touch us. Many of us many years ago,
[2:16:20] Lord God, that was our time. And Father
[2:16:23] God, you have other children out there
[2:16:25] that have not heard your word, that have
[2:16:28] not come into the fullness of your word,
[2:16:30] Lord God. Father, your word is going
[2:16:34] out, Father, to Brazil, to other places
[2:16:36] in this in this world, Lord God, to find
[2:16:39] that last one, Father. Lord God,
[2:16:43] we've seen your word be made manifest,
[2:16:46] not in an old form, Lord God, of
[2:16:48] yesterday, but in a word of today, of
[2:16:50] now, Lord God. And Lord God, we know
[2:16:53] that your word does not go out
[2:16:56] and co and come back void. Lord God, we
[2:16:59] know that your word goes out and
[2:17:01] manifests itself in sons and daughters.
[2:17:04] And Lord God, we say, be it unto me
[2:17:07] according to your word, Lord God. Father
[2:17:10] God, we want to be walking not ahead or
[2:17:12] behind, but hand in hand with you,
[2:17:14] Father. Your word is fresh. Your word is
[2:17:18] real. Your word is more upto-date than
[2:17:20] the news that was produced this morning.
[2:17:22] Father, we thank you for it, heavenly
[2:17:24] father. Lord God, my heart quivers
[2:17:27] inside of me, seeing what you're doing,
[2:17:29] Father, knowing, Lord God, that we are
[2:17:31] standing truly on the edge of time, Lord
[2:17:33] God. And I thank you from my heart, from
[2:17:36] the bottom of my soul, Lord God. And I
[2:17:38] know many others in here are doing the
[2:17:40] same thing, saying, "Lord God, you
[2:17:42] brought me to this point. You're
[2:17:44] revealing your word. You're revealing
[2:17:45] your word and manifesting it in my life
[2:17:48] and in our lives. And we thank you for
[2:17:49] it, Lord God. Father, we thank you for
[2:17:52] the dedicated ministry that you've given
[2:17:54] us, Lord God, that have laid hours and
[2:17:56] hours and hours studying your word,
[2:17:58] praying, Lord God, to bring to us, Lord
[2:18:00] God, what we have need of, Father. Lord
[2:18:02] God, we came this morning with thoughts
[2:18:04] in our heart, with questions to be
[2:18:06] answered, Father, and you've been so
[2:18:08] mindful, Lord God. We thank you for
[2:18:10] that, Lord. Now, as we leave this place,
[2:18:13] heavenly father, the word that we heard,
[2:18:16] Lord God, we ask that you'd just keep it
[2:18:18] to the forefront of our mind, Lord God,
[2:18:20] if there's questions in our hearts, Lord
[2:18:22] God, we just ask you'd answer according
[2:18:25] to your perfect will, Lord God. Answer
[2:18:27] each and every question that we have,
[2:18:28] Lord God, it is your pure word being
[2:18:31] made manifest in this day. Lord, bless
[2:18:34] the people, Lord God. Bless them
[2:18:37] greatly. You have blessed us greatly.
[2:18:39] Now, as we leave, be with us, Lord God.
[2:18:42] May we just have a time of fellowship,
[2:18:45] Lord God. Some food to eat to give us
[2:18:48] energy to bring us back, Lord God, to
[2:18:51] hear your word preached again by Brother
[2:18:53] John. Father, Lord God, it's you
[2:18:56] speaking through a man, a dedicated
[2:18:59] vessel, Lord God, ask that you bless
[2:19:01] him, Lord God. Give to him that which
[2:19:03] you know we have need of. Father, in
[2:19:05] Jesus Christ's name, we pray these
[2:19:07] things. Amen. Amen.
[2:19:10] God bless you.
[2:19:15] We walk in the light as we shake hands
[2:19:18] with one another. And God bless you in
[2:19:20] this.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; We walk in the light.
[2:19:26] Beautiful
[2:19:29] life
