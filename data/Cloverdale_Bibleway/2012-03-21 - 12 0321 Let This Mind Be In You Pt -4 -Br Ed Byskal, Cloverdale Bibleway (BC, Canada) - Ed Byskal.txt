Brother Hugh, message has two requests that he would like the church to pray for. One, a friend that he has been witnessing to for many years. He's asked us to pray for his wife's brother who's just been suffering from an aneurysm in the head just recently. And we also want to remember his daughter, Sister Jenny Gray who has cancer uh that's growing in her chest. And just ask that the saints would pray for her at this time. Brother Kyle, if you'd come if you have a need or request upon your heart. We have a very wonderful, loving, caring heavenly father. Amen. Brother Kyle. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to be here tonight. Lord, we're so thankful that you've called us. Lord, you're our savior. You're our God. You're our friend. You're our father. Lord, we love you so much. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I just pray you meet with us in a special way tonight, Lord. Just by your grace, help us get in that channel, Lord, to be able to hear from you, Lord. It's it's been a busy week for many, Lord. Many different tests and trials, Lord. Maybe emotional upheavalss, God, but we've come here just to have our hearts open to you, Lord. You know our heart and you know the purpose why you've made us and why you've you have us upon this earth Jesus. And we're so thankful that we're able to lift up our eyes from whence cometh our help Lord. Our our help cometh from you Jesus. Oh God everyone here Lord has a a burden has a a desire Lord has a question and but God you know Lord. Oh Father we're so thankful Lord. We love you Lord. You've you've done so many wonderful things for us. Oh Jesus. just pray you bless whoever come behind this pulpit tonight.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you each and everyone as you have your seats this evening. Once again, we want to greet everyone that's gathered here in the visible congregation. Those on the telephone hookup and the internet, we want to say God bless you to you as well. Any visitors that we have with us tonight, we want to say welcome in the name of the Lord. Trust that you enjoy the service this evening. Our pastor is going to be coming just shortly to minister to us tonight. I'm looking forward to that. &gt;&gt; Aren't you? Amen. Brother Ernie, it's good to have you back from down in Seattle. I trust the Saints had a wonderful time with you down there. Why don't we turn the screen to 992? I am redeemed. Love now abounds. Used to be a lot of hurts. Used to be a lot of pain. But when Jesus steps in, all of that fades away. Sometimes it takes a little time for a scar to disappear. But you know, it joins itself right back to the rest of the body. Love takes over and projects. And I believe that's each one of our portions. No matter what we've come through, the week has been a hard week already. I'm sure for many. Amen. But we just want to let off the pressure tonight and have whatever the Lord has for us this evening. Where there was hate, love now. Where there was confusion, peace shall reign. I'm walking with Jesus. I'm a child of the king. It's all because I am. Oh, I am redeemed. a cry for it was Jesus that changed my whole life. If anybody ask you just who I am until then I am redeemed. Oh, I'll tell his favor. I'll tell his precious love. I'll tell his goodness to me for virgin. My redemption, my precious blood will I am set free. Oh, I am free. Sing it out now. Jesus that my sound wonderful worthy. I am the Jesus. I am fulfilling. I am redeemed. I creation of brand new man. Just as we invite brother Bisco to come this evening. Hallelu he redee me. Will I be born into it? I thank God he justified me of his fullness and we all received of me. I believe I all things are happening. once again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He redeemed me. Yes, I to me. Oh, and I just might have all the creation. I found I am a new creation. I'm a brand new man. I'd like to sing Brother Derek also. I'm amazed that he has loved me. &gt;&gt; We do that. Amen. I'm amazed that you love me. Heat. Heat. I am in my heart away. I want away. that you love me. I found my sins are all they're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. Amen. Let's just bow in prayer. Father, you have heard your children singing. How amazed we are, &gt;&gt; that you loved us. How amazed we are that you redeemed us and sent their transforming power changing us into new persons, into new sons and daughters of God. Father, I pray that you will take your word and quicken it to us tonight. Pray father that you will just read our lives like an open book and may each one know that you are present and that you know every detail of their lives. We pray that you will instruct us and help us now Lord both speaker and hearers in the name of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ to whom we give all the glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Happy to have brother Tom and Joanne back. Amen. &gt;&gt; I see brother Ben up there back from the island. &gt;&gt; And I'm sure the folks on the island were happy to have somebody there for uh number of days. And brother Kyle and Sister Christina were over. Had a service this last weekend. And uh uh good thing you didn't answer me earlier, Brother Kyle. I was going to have you speaking tonight. Uh, but we're at the post of duty. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh, Brother Tom was prepared to speak as well, but I just had a little something on my heart. And I don't know whether you're praying, brother Roy, or what it is, but I keep I keep hanging over with about another two and three/arters after every service. And then something else opens up. And someone, a minister said to me once, I said, "What you been speaking on?" I said, "And that isn't even recently. That's a long time ago." I said, "Well, I've been speaking on the mind of God." He says, "You're still on the mind of God." I guess that's what he remembered that was speaking on. It's It's hard to forget that because that's where you came from. I'm just thinking about where I came from. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. If you have your Bibles, turn to uh the book of Titus. &gt;&gt; And we'll read from the uh reading from the second chapter. Sure. Nice to see everyone out this evening. Brother Ernie, God bless you. Had a nice time in Seattle. Wonderful. Hallelujah. Probably be a little bit different of a service, but uh on Wednesday night, we we can afford that. I'm going to start reading at the first verse. Titus is just before Hebrews. But speak thou, this is the second chapter, I'm sorry. But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine, that the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. The aged women likewise, that they may be in behavior as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things, that they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chasteed, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. D young men likewise exhort to be sober minded and sober when we run into that it's it's vigilant to be watchful and vigilant in all things seventh verse in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine showing unccorruptness gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you. Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things, not answering again, not perloining perloining but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our savior in all things. For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. And we remember well the uh scripture text from the last three services. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. And this is the mind that these things proceed from. And the scripture says teaching us that denying ungodliness and that teaching us is the instruction that is the one that is teaching must must know these things. It's in his mind before we can be taught. May God bless us as you have your seats. And uh so all of the things that were spoken here by Apostle Paul to Titus who he also called a son like he did Timothy. Uh there's only one only one person that can mold our characters that we might be able to do these things. I don't know if you noticed, but I was studying this for a while before I began to realize that there's an awful lot packed into these 12 verses. &gt;&gt; There's a lot packed into it. And I can tell you it could take a whole lifetime of teaching and learning and instruction in order to have these things as a part of our makeup &gt;&gt; to actually have them just lived out in a natural way. And so, uh, that only the mind of God, as we've been speaking about, could possess the wisdom of how to train up his children in the way that we should go. Now, this is going to be interesting, but I need to get it started right at the beginning. This word teaching in the scripture is is in the in the Greek. It's spoken of several other times in the scripture. And the other times it's used as chastening. Uh that and I'm going to read some scriptures for you so you won't have to turn to them. Just read them quickly. Speaking of Jesus, it says that who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that uh and was heard in that he feared. And though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. Now, he wasn't he wasn't sinful to begin with, but yet there were certain things that were molded into the life of Christ. I'll just give you one example that uh there were things that he learned. He learned from living and we all are. I hope that we're all learning something from life. The Bible tells us, you know, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, most of that is words of Jesus. But when he was when he was falsely accused and when he came before judgment he came before the people and all the people you know this is the Sanhedrin this is the leaders the spiritual leaders and he had said he'd made this statement destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up and that was the very thing that they threw up uh threw before him and threw into the court this man has said He's going to destroy this temple and raise it up in three days. And then he was silent. You know, it wouldn't have taken I'm I'm sure I I tried to put myself in that place. I think I would have had an answer. I would have said, "Well, you misunderstood me." &gt;&gt; Uh I can I can clear that up for you very easily. I was speaking of my own body, my own self. You know, uh I I'm not I'm not speaking of this great temple that took 46 years to build. Wouldn't that been simple? But rather than do that, rather than clarify it, rather than clear himself, he just remained silent. &gt;&gt; I can tell you those are some of the things that he learned. And because of that, he he suffered uh uh the accusations that were false and uh and and he learned uh obedience by the things which he suffered. There's a couple other scriptures that I want to turn to. The Bible tells us in Acts 7 and 22. You don't have to turn to it. Just one verse. And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and deeds. And brother Brandham says in faith by experience, he said it was Moses, the great prophet how that it how that if there was any man trained and well-trained was Moses. He had took all of the degrees that Egypt had and could teach me. He could teach their men theology. He was the smartest man in Egypt. And he was full 40 years old when he went when he went out to deliver his brethren. But you see, he made a mistake. God took him out behind the desert. And there he stayed for 40 years for God to beat some of the theology out of him. Take the clay and beat it down till it's ready. other places he said they had to take all of that years of Egypt out of him. So that so the desert gave him an opposite experience and he wasn't ready for the deliverance his deliverance uh uh you know his deliverance phase to become a redeemer. He wasn't ready for that till he had 40 years in the in the wilderness and in the desert and met the pillar of fire. So it was a different kind of an experience. And then uh in in tested faith, one was faith by experience. The other was tested faith produces goods produces goods. And Moses after having 40 years of theology, very best training that could be given a man. But he got out in the wilderness one time with a bunch of men and over two million people. Led them 40 years. This is now the next stage of his life. Led them 40 years and come out of the wilderness without one feeble person among them. Wouldn't some of you doctors like to know what Dr. Moses had for a prescription? &gt;&gt; He learned some things in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; He said, "How many babies was born each night?" Dr. Moses had a prescription in his briefcase. I got a little secret. He said, "You want me to read it to you? Here, here it is. All of you doctors, I'm the Lord that heals all your diseases." &gt;&gt; That was his prescription. It worked for 40 years with several million people without one feeble one among them. For one day in the backside of the desert, God came to him and he had an experience. When he had killed the Egyptian, he looked this way and that way, killing one man. He was scared. He had never met God. But after meeting God, he went down and sunk the whole Egyptian army. &gt;&gt; Isn't that true? &gt;&gt; And never did look back. He had faith. He knew what it meant. Sure, he believed God. And he endured as seeing him who is invisible. After he had found God and met God and had an experience, he had faith in it. He had faith in that experience. Be good for us tonight. You're here because at some point in your life, perhaps maybe it wasn't today. Maybe it was a year ago or years ago, but you had an experience that you knew you met God. It was a transforming experience. It was a pivotal time in your life. You need to always hold that in front of you. I did meet God. &gt;&gt; I had a real experience with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said he had faith in that experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us also in 1 Corinthians 11:32, "And when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world." Now, when we hear the word word chastened, we immediately think of, you know, chastening as being whipped or being beaten and so on. that that is used in the scripture when it says when Pilate said and it's used less in the scripture than the reference that I have today when Pilate said I'll I'll I'll chasten him or I'll chastise him and let him go and the people cried out no they they didn't want just that they wanted something further but when the scripture says but when you are judged when we are judged we are chasened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. So, it's to our benefit. It's not that kind of chastening. It's teaching and instruction and and God prompting and moving us in the right direction. Look, when we teach uh when you that are parents, when you teach your children, it's not always a pleasant experience for them. It's not always a pleasant experience for you, but it's the right experience. That's right. &gt;&gt; You're trying to preserve them from, you know, perhaps a lot of uh hardship down the road. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; It says also in Hebrews 12:7, "If we endure chastening, if we endure this instruction and this teaching, God deleth with you as sons. For what son is he whom the father chastineth not?" I want to put a little different slant on this chasening just for a moment. It is uh for someone to be trained. If you think of an athlete or if you think of anyone that is learning any skill, you you know you have to be taught. You have to be disciplined. You may have to go through the rigor. And uh and I I want to be very very blunt with you and very open. Christianity as a whole has really brought a deception on the people because coming to church is not really the whole aspect of being trained. If you said to a if you said to someone in the in just in a world in the sports events uh all any of the sport fields if you said because it's one that people re readily understand if you said well um I'm going to train you for the uh Olympics or I'm going to train you for a gold medal or I'm going to train you that you'll be number one in your country or part of number one team in your country. you would right away expect that this is going to take a good deal of my time. &gt;&gt; This is going to call for a disciplined life. &gt;&gt; This is going to call for a disciplined diet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not something you're going to come to church twice or three times a week and sit for an hour and expect to be a hero out there. You're not going to get number one place. That's that's not the kind of training it is. And that training is like a it's a chastisement in that sense of the word. It's rigorous training and and exercising and whatever. And while you're in it, you &gt;&gt; you get sore muscles &gt;&gt; while you're in it. You know, you get played out. &gt;&gt; While you're in it, you can barely drag yourself out of bed to start. I have to get up at 5 in the morning and be there at be at the gym at 6 and do all these things. And and I've heard of people in fact this I have a cousin and uh she got married and after she got married she had I think she had a child and a son and then had a twins and they were sons and had another son and before she was done she had five boys and she lived in Saskatoon. Brother Hillbran and she told me that in the winter time when it was cold and they were in the hockey and practicing all of them had to be in the hockey. So they were practicing and she says the last ones were playing at night and she had to get up so early in the morning and take the next ones the next batch to training and practice and everything else. She just left her car running outside. She said I didn't even shut it off. It was so cold. I just keep the car running and it seemed she said that's all she was doing is driving back and forth with these five boys, you know, at all different ages. And said, I just kept my car running outside. Well, I'll tell you what, uh those fellas were in training. I don't know if they got anywhere or not. M maybe not. I don't know what the boys did, but I have talked to people who who have been training and and some that have been studying. Some of you folks studied to get somewhere. I don't care what really what it was. It takes some discipline. &gt;&gt; Even you that are in high school especially you're going to or in college you're going to study and you you know do you just feel oh man here I go again I can study tonight. No it doesn't really work that way. Even coming here to stand behind the pulpit &gt;&gt; calls for some discipline. &gt;&gt; Amen. You look out the window and the sun is shining and say, "Oh man, it'd be so nice just to go out and have a walk." But you got to be ready to stand the post of duty. &gt;&gt; And the walk goes away and everything else goes away and you stay there and and study. So I can tell you that that is really the direction of of thought for a few moments. But but the church world and and Satan has used religion He's used religion to bring about the description of the church in the church age and the last one &gt;&gt; lukewarm &gt;&gt; lethargic &gt;&gt; because because the church became enchanted and enticed by the system of the world and by Christianity what they call Christianity. All I have to do is go to church. The preacher does it. He'll he'll preach for 20 minutes or an hour, hour and a half or whatever more and I'm done. And I go home and do what I want to do and do what I want to do the rest of my life. And then when church time comes, I go back and the and the sense that that is all that's really to it is really a falsehood &gt;&gt; that's upon the people. And uh I remember when uh Gerson Solomon was in my home, he said the difference between us Jews and you Gentiles, he said to to be Jewish is your whole life. &gt;&gt; You are Jewish. &gt;&gt; And and your religion is not something you do. It is you. &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, you you know, he just doesn't know what the message says. &gt;&gt; The message is you also. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. To endure chastening or endure this training, endure this instruction, not for just to hear it in the service and say, "When do I go home, but tomorrow and every day?" And God dealeth with you. If we endure teaching, chastening, instruction, rigorous discipline, if we endure that, then God dealeth with uh with us as sons. For what son is he whom the father chastineth not? Brother Brennham talks about the ceremony of adoption and that is maturity. He says now if this child was obedient that's obedient there was a ceremony to be made when the child become matured. They' taken the child out into a public place a robe upon him a royal robe and they had a ceremony. And it was the ceremony of adoption. The child that had been born into the family uh become placed by adoption in the family. And after that, that boy's name was just as good on a check as his daddy's as his daddy's was. He was the heir of all things. But the father, he was he was committed to a tutor, the Bible tells us. And if we're under tutors and the tutor is the Holy Spirit and he directs us and we we yield ourselves to that, we don't live after, you know, after every dictate and desire of the flesh, but we live after uh the the voice and witness of the Holy Spirit and the instruction that God has given us. And I want to say just here at the beginning, the message is absolutely full of instruction. And it was not the nice parts of the blessings and the healings and the supernatural that the people were repulsed with. It was when he began to instruct &gt;&gt; and they were not able to take the chastening of the Lord &gt;&gt; and prove they were not sons and daughters &gt;&gt; because a son and daughter like I've I've talked to more than one came under the sound of the gospel. I remember brother Charlie Drake especially sister he said when the message when he heard the message he says it just took the height off his back but I loved it. &gt;&gt; How many of us have had that kind it just chopped your doctrine to pieces. &gt;&gt; It just took the the whole foundation of your life away. But you said I like it. &gt;&gt; There's something in me that says I want it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there was a witness inside. It's good for me. I always knew that was correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 22:1 and2, and you've heard me say this before here, and it came to pass after these things, this is speaking now about Abraham and his relationship with God, that God did tempt Abraham. And the and the word tempting tempt that he tempted him is that he tried him to the supreme and the ultimate limit. And the word is one of the one of the descriptions is the assay. He assayed him. And if you understand mining, they they drill a core. I've described this before, but they will drill a core and then they lay they they will drill so many feet and then lay that core of rock. It's round, smooth, and keep drilling and they'll lay it in the next in the next and they have trays. And then they will take that tray out and take one of these long round about that big a round of ore, rock ore, and they put it in a in a mill, a grinder, and they grind it with balls in there called a ball mill. And they'll grind it till it's just it's it's it's more than powder. It it is just a slush, a sludge in there. And and when it's ground out, then they take it and shift it onto a vibratory table like this on a slope and water just washes gently over it. And then the various metals become visible whether there's copper in there, whether there's silver in there, whether there's gold in there, etc. And as they keep assaying each one of those, but you can't assay the rock unless you grind it to powder. That's acid. God ground Abraham, his friend, to powder. &gt;&gt; He had waited 25 years for this son. &gt;&gt; It was a tedious time. He's He's no different than you folks. No different at all if you'd waited 25 years for something and then God after you had a supernatural experience, a supernatural happening. Imagine having this son at the age that he was and the age his wife was and then you have the son and then God tempts him going to assay him and find out if he's really a the father of the faith. take your son up and offer him as a sacrifice. And the next verse says, "And he departed. He He was ready to go." &gt;&gt; Whatever God said, said, "Climb over this stone wall, you said, you know, he wants you to jump. Just how high do you want me to jump?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's going to make a way. &gt;&gt; He's not going to ask us to do something that you can't do. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, I'll say in regards to this message to young and old alike, you can do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You will be victorious. &gt;&gt; I don't say that of my own accord. I don't say that to even get you to respond. I'm saying that because God called you to this word. And he wouldn't call you to it if he didn't know you could do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it came to pass that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham. And he said, Behold, here I am. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Mariah, and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee of. That's quite explicit, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I don't think Abraham even misunderstood a word of that. offer him for a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I'm going to show you. This son that you waited for all of these years, this promise that you waited for. It's almost to me like the moment of the rapture would come and God would say, "I want you to go through the tribulation." &gt;&gt; Boy, you're quiet. &gt;&gt; It's almost that way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I've waited for this promise. This is the This is what I've lived for. &gt;&gt; I want you to offer it as a sacrifice. And this isn't what Abraham wanted to hear. &gt;&gt; That's not what he wanted to hear. That wasn't the message, his sermon he wanted to hear. He had waited so patiently for this promise. And now God was calling for him to make the ultimate sacrifice. One of the descriptions of this word tempt is to put it to the proof test. So God was going to put them to the proof test. And that happens folks. &gt;&gt; I'm not sorry to say it, but yet on one hand I'm a little sorry to say it because I'm going to say it and you have to hear it. And that is we say we're bride and hallelujah. We get all enthused when we're told all about what God has done for the bride and what he said about the bride and where she's going to go and the table that's going to be spread thousands of miles long. But somehow along in life and looking down upon you tonight, I think that maybe some of you have tasted of that. God just says, "No, you've said your bride. I'm just going to have you prove it. And you talk about squeeze. &gt;&gt; People are looking for the squeeze. &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I think most everyone has experience some squeeze &gt;&gt; one way or another, one kind or another. &gt;&gt; In fact, is I know that some of us have experienced uh squeeze sufficient that we really didn't want anymore. &gt;&gt; Is that not right? Amen. &gt;&gt; So what do you say about that brother Ed is what I'm saying is that we are being trained. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are being taught. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are being disciplined. &gt;&gt; And being disciplined by the word. Now, here I'm going to turn a corner because the day that we are living in, folks, brothers, sisters, the day that we're living in is a treacherous day. And this is a treacherous time. &gt;&gt; And Satan has thrown everything in his arsenal against this age. And if he if his most cunning was to be deceptive, you can believe that the scripture and brother Brandham quoted it many times that even the elect, if it were possible, &gt;&gt; would be deceived. &gt;&gt; Oh, and we can say, well, they can't be deceived. I can tell you if we cannot be deceived, it's because we didn't only, you know, have some immediate experience or shed some tears or said, "Lord, forgive me." It's that you went through some assay test. &gt;&gt; You've been ground down. &gt;&gt; You've been ground to powder and you came out the other side and you found out, I survived. &gt;&gt; And God may have another one and he may have a harder one. But if you know that you're a son and daughter of God, you know that you're going to come through. You know that his grace is sufficient for you. And I got confidence in you, Father. You're not going to call on me to do anything that I will not be able to stand. &gt;&gt; You will not tempt me beyond what I'm able to bear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't want this for a Wednesday night service, but &gt;&gt; we're going to have it anyway. Amen. &gt;&gt; Conditions of our surrounding. So now I just want your full attention and really listen close. Conditions of our surroundings today are a strong influence and they influence from every area of our lives. I don't have to talk about young people. I don't have to talk about older people. I don't have to talk about families. There isn't anybody but what uh there isn't anybody that'll escape this and it doesn't it makes no difference what area you shall go into as far as uh geographically say well I will I will go here or I will go there uh that won't make a bit of difference. The same devil that's where you live is the same devil that's over there. &gt;&gt; And he's got something for every country. He's got something for every culture. He's got something for every place geographically. He's got something for the businessman. He's got something for the educator. He's got the He's got philosophy. And he's got uh you know all the all the answers and and and uh if you want to go into politics, for sure he's there. &gt;&gt; And whatever area you want to go into, say, "Well, I I'll just go into religion." For sure you'll find him. Right. Today I've been pondering, not today only, but I mean in this time I've been pondering. I've even mentioned it to my wife because I kind of marvel at everything today has to be entertaining. I remember some years ago uh when the advertisements on the radio and advertisements on the television and advertisements in the newspaper wherever you found an advertisement they're very stoic and very formal and you know very you know just exacting as uh regarding regarding their product and the advertising agencies and so on were saying that if if the people if the advertising agency agencies don't smarten up, they're not going to sell the product. People want to be humored, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They want it. There's got to be humor attached to it. Of course, it maybe didn't may perhaps didn't register with you when you heard it on the and heard brother Brandham saying it, but he says that America and for forgive me folks that are on the US side, I include ourselves with it. There isn't I don't see any difference really between Canada, United States as far as kind of life and the kind of things, you know, living standards and so on. We all are we all are the same. We respond the same. We're essentially one people in that sense of the word. But he said it's a haha spirit. &gt;&gt; It has to be funny, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not hilarious, but you have to just Yeah. You know, and you're you're sucked in to buy something &gt;&gt; cuz it's it's it's just a little bit humorous. You just watch for it. For sure it's there. And fact is I I I I've encountered since I've been thinking about this for some time. I've encountered I I w I watch the ads and I see you know whenever we don't get a newspaper to our door but even if I hear an ad or something and you don't even know what it is that they're trying to get you inspired or engaged with because it doesn't seem to be connected with anything but they're but they're trying to put something across to you and it's really really amazing. Maybe you haven't noticed that, but anyway, I'll read you some quotes. How that do? &gt;&gt; Everything has to be enjoyable to make it desirable for the people. And I say this has crept into the church and is a real threat to the believer as well. Thy loving kindness, he says, the American people. Now, I understand brother Brandham is he's American and so he's talking about his own nation. Now, the American people want to be entertained. They don't want the gospel no more. This is in 1958. They don't want the gospel no more. They want entertainment. And and the devil's given them all that he can. Just led them in all around everything. And they don't thirst for God no more. All the kids in this country, 95% of the kids in Chattanooga, he was the service was in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He said, could tell you more about Davy Crockett than they could tell you about Jesus Christ. Maybe the kids today don't know about Davy Crockett, but they know about somebody else. He said 95% of the women can tell you more about Arthur Godfrey. he was uh a kind of a humorist or whatever on the radio or Elvis Presley. Then they could tell you about Jesus Christ. They said, "Think of it. Think of it. Can't you see it's gone?" And then he cries out, "Flee, Christians. There's a fountain opened. Water is near. Life is near. Flee to it quickly. Drink. Drink. Drink till you can't drink no more. God will satisfy that thirst. God bless you. He said, "Now I'm going to pray for you." It was it's quite something just after he had said that. Now, I've got quite a few more. So, I want you to listen closely. American people, he said, "This is uh Door to the Heart in Harrison Harrisonenberg, Virginia. American people want to be entertained. They want some uh little Hollywood star with kinky hair and dressed up like I don't know what to come out and to make entertainment because that's what you see on your television. I'm not just one oldfashioned preacher that believes that's there's no cure but the blood of Jesus Christ and that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when I'm speaking to you today I'm speaking about the conditions that are in the world. not speaking to you about your own life or your own home. I know that you have a hunger for God, but these are things and these are conditions that are very real and they're very present in the world. He said, "And and now you you might consider me kind of way off, but I want you, especially you young people that's got some years ahead if the time goes on to listen very close. In 1954, Brother Brandon preached the invasion of America. Now, we might say, well, America, Europe was invaded. The Philippines were invaded. Vietnam was invaded. Uh, all kinds of nations. If you go on Google and just go the invasion of and you'll get all kinds of them. They've been invaded. And I'm going to carry that thought through for a while. But Elijah the prophet spoke the invasion of America &gt;&gt; and some people I'll just throw this in quickly because I'm going to come to it. A lot of people are waiting. I was in Germany and uh in Europe and there are people that are there they're there they catch that in the uh brother Brandham's message that you know his seventh vision was just uh uh burning stumps and just smoldering ruins. Well, I tell you what, folks. It's a lot more smoldering ruins today &gt;&gt; than it would be under an atomic bomb. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's my own belief. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said in one place he's talking to the people and they've been rejecting the message for years. He said, "You ought to take a looking glass and look into your own soul and see how decrepit and how they'd like to see somebody healed." you know, that was all twisted up and mangled up and all out of shape and and born and twisted all bone structure and everything. And that they saw that all straightened out, oh, the whole place would go wild. But he was telling them, you ought to look in the looking glass of the word of God and see the condition of your own soul. And he was trying to get the people to get them to see that the that their soul was much more twisted up than some human that was a that was in a terrible condition. &gt;&gt; And that when a soul like that experiences a a a deliverance and a healing, it's a greater miracle than one that has whose body is corrected. &gt;&gt; I'm sure you agree with that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; In the door of door to the heart. Yeah. And and so I read that one. Then in in the evasion invasion of the United States, I have two or three quotes from here. They're not just quotes of the past. Uh you want to keep in balance. This is a prophet of God speaking about a nation. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "We found out we find out we've had 30,000 converts in 6 weeks and 6 weeks later, I think he was I'm not too sure. I didn't read the quote uh the uh portion before the context. It might have been uh one of Billy Graham's meetings." He says, "And then six weeks later, we haven't got one." He said, "There's something wrong somewhere, and it's all glamour." Now, he he he's discerning. He's not discerning you have a cancer or you have tuberculosis. He's discerning a problem in the country. &gt;&gt; And the problem is severe. &gt;&gt; We have 30,000 converts and now we haven't got any. &gt;&gt; I expect a response from you. &gt;&gt; That's serious business. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we'd had 30,000 converts in some meetings recently and now they were all gone, you'd be saying, "Brother Ed, something is wrong." &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God, the spirit of Elijah saying, "Something's wrong." And the first words out of his mouth is glamour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, that might not appear to be like a Is that a disease? Is that that terrible? Is that that bad? Elijah thinks so. &gt;&gt; So he says glamour putting on. He said the world through television, through radio, through picture shows and those outlets there has corrupted this nation with pomerot of Hollywood. &gt;&gt; Everything wants to be a big glamour. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the truth? He said, "You know that's the truth. And we don't have to have any more old-fashioned religion that we used to have years ago. &gt;&gt; That's where 30,000 went." &gt;&gt; And then in this is now remember the title. It's still the invasion of United States. He said, "What is it? It's the devil." He said, "It's the devil. The invasion." He swept into this nation like a roaring lion. He set himself down there in the best place that he had in Hollywood. He said, "I can get the movies here, there, here until the television comes on and then I'll get them." And he set he sat down there. And the church people instead of shutting down the shows and not letting their children go, they give them 10 cents to go to a Sunday afternoon and and and send them down there so they can have a little social card party. uh be out to their self. Now, I know you may say, "Well, we don't do that, Brother Ed. Who you preaching to?" No, I know that we don't do that. But the influence of that spirit is not going to leave just because you're a message believer or you go to Bible way or go to some other, you know, Bible believers tabernacle or who knows where. God's Satan's not going to just stand back and say, "Well, I guess I can't touch those folks." No, he's going to work that much harder on those folks. He's going to work that much harder on those that profess this message to get them to see if they if he can just get them relaxed. &gt;&gt; Get them apathetic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's something it's something, you know, I I'm just going to speak my mind. I'm going to speak my heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when when when I was young, you had to you had to get up and get with it and work and work hard to make a living to survive. &gt;&gt; And some of you maybe been on farms and whatever more. You know what I'm talking about. Everything was a hardship. To go to school was a hardship. Uh to to go and feed the animals was a hardship. To take them to water was a hardship. to split the wood or all those things. You say, "Ah, brother Biscllow, we don't do that." Now, I know you just turn the thermostat. But that is what I'm speaking all about. We don't come in the church and just turn a thermostat. Somebody Somebody has paid a price. &gt;&gt; Somebody has been disciplined. and and Satan would like you to believe that it's only the ministry or it's only the deacons or it's only somebody that kind of runs the show and I just come and enjoy it. No, this is not an entertainment. &gt;&gt; This is this is not something you just come in and uh be a be a participant. No, it's not that at all. It is one functioning body. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care how young you are, how old you are, there's always something that a person can do for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So, well, I'm just a lady. Bake some biscuits. &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody maybe there's somebody that you can help or you can be a benefit to or be an encouragement to. And it doesn't take a whole lot. Sometime you just shake a person's hand, you smile and really, you know, let the message come through. God bless you. I've been thinking about you. Fact is, I was praying for you. That's a great encouragement. You don't know what that one's going through. &gt;&gt; So he said that he sat down there. He said, "And they just turn the television on and watch all the dirty, rotten Tommy rot there is in the world on it." And he said, "That's right." He says, "I ain't got nothing against the movie. I ain't got nothing against the television. It's not It's the rotten stuff that's on it." And that's what it is. And if you have kept it moral, it have been it would have stayed. It would it it it had to stay moral. Now, I thought I would just do a little search. Going to watch my time, too. So, I'm not going to stay long. Brother Brandham talks about the Jewish people and the 144,000 and so on in Israel, and he talks about the Wall Street Jews and so on. Said, "I don't mean those Wall Street Jews." And listen, I'm not anti I'm very pro-Jewish as you know, but I I I have always known, you know, Warner Brothers, Fox Brothers, uh, Paramount Studios is all Jewish. And may perhaps this is going to surprise you, but I have scriptures here. And if you want to go home and read uh Ezekiel 16, it's a very sorry account. And God details how he found Israel and I found you wallowing in your own blood and out in the desert place and I picked you up and I bathed you and I washed you. And then he talk and then he goes into how they backsliden and they got fat and they got you know they just got laxidasical and apathetic and lethargic and they just got lukewarm. &gt;&gt; These is God's people. &gt;&gt; These are delivered people. &gt;&gt; And this happened to those those people at that time. And uh the Bible tells us in Ezekiel and I'll maybe read two or three verses if we get a little later on if I have time. And then he he speaks about how they then they begin to go after other gods and begin to sacrifice to other gods. And he comes against them so hard and the verses that I have selected are along these lines. He tells them you became worse &gt;&gt; than the heathen nation. &gt;&gt; And one place it says they're not half as bad as you are. and he just castigates them and rebukes them even though he's a god of love and he's he's a a god of redemption yet this was what he he described Israel he described Israel at friends and let me tell you something they weren't subjected to the spirit of deception that you and I are &gt;&gt; they weren't subjected to you know an an iPad and an iPod And now now it went from the theater to the television to your pocket &gt;&gt; to your hand and you can see anything on there. And if the devil pulled it over their eyes, taking it from the theater into the house, I tell you, he's really pulled the wool over the people's eyes when he put it in their pocket and put it in their hand &gt;&gt; and put all the filth that's possible &gt;&gt; on your iPod and and and I iPod, I tab, and uh whatever. And dumb phone. I thought that's a better name than smartphone. &gt;&gt; This article is How Jewish is Hollywood? It's out of the New York I'm sorry, out of the Los Angeles Times newspaper. It's written by a Jew. His name is Joel Stein. He said, "I've never been so upset by a poll in my life. Only 22% of Americans now believe that the movie and television industries are pretty much run by Jews." Down, he said, from 50% in 1964. He's really upset that the poll of the people thought there's only only 22% of them now thought that the Hollywood was run by Jews. In 1964, it was 50%. He says the Anti-defamation League, which released the poll results last month, sees in this in these numbers a victory against stereotyping. Actually, it just shows how dumb America has gotten. Jews totally run Hollywood. &gt;&gt; How deeply Jewish is Hollywood? Now, a lot of these names mean nothing to you, mean nothing to me, but it's it's part of the article. How deeply Jewish is Hollywood? Now, now when I read this, I want you to think about all the things you've listened to in the message. What Brother Brandham said, he said Paris, France used to export their filth here. &gt;&gt; Now, he said we export it over there. &gt;&gt; And you talk about the earthquake in California. God has a justified reason why he wants to sink the place. &gt;&gt; And he even said that Hollywood became Satan's seat. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not preaching for a popularity contest. I'm just preaching so we get some in instruction also because it has invaded every area of this West Coast, America, Canada, and the world. You can go to Japan and find it there. You can go to Beijing and find it there. You can go any place in the world and find it there. And the thing that they really want in the western culture is the western entertainment. &gt;&gt; He says when the when the studio chiefs took a full page ad in the Los Angeles Times a few weeks ago to demand that the Screen Actors Guild settle its contract. The open letter was signed by News Corp. President Peter Chinnan, Jewish. Parammont Pictures Chairman Brad Gray, Jewish. Walt Disney Company chief executive Robert Eager, Jewish. Sony Pictures chairman Michael Linton, surprise. Dutch Jewish. Warner Brothers chairman Barry Meyer, Jewish. CBS Corp. Chief Executive Leslie Moonveves, so Jewish, his great uncle, was the first prime minister of Israel. MGM chairman Harry Sloan, Jewish, and NBC Universal chief executive Jeff Zucker, mega Jewish. If either of the Weinstein brothers had signed, this group would have not only the power to shut down all the film production, but to form a minion uh with enough Fiji water on hand, which I don't understand this phrase, to fill a mikvah. The person they were yelling at in the ad was SAG President Alan Rosenberg. Take a guess. The scathing rebuttal to the ad was written by entertainment super agent Ari Emmanuel, Jew with Israeli parents on the Huffington Post, which is owned by Ariana Huffington, not Jewish and has never worked in Hollywood. The Jews are so dominant. I had to scour the trades to come up with six Gentiles in high positions at entertainment companies. When I called them to talk about their incredible advancement, five of them refused to talk to me, apparently out of fear of insulting Jews. The sixth AMC president, Charlie Collier, turned out to be Jewish. As a proud Jew, I want America to know about our accomplishments. Yes, we control Hollywood, and without us, you'd be flipping between the 700 Club and Davy and Goliath on TV all day. So, I've taken it upon myself to reconvince America that Jews run Hollywood by launching a public relations campaign because that's what we do best. I'm weighing several slogans, including Hollywood, more Jewish than ever, or Hollywood from the people who brought you the Bible. And Hollywood, if you enjoy TV and movies, then you probably like Jews after all. And if you think for a minute they haven't covered an area of your life, you're deceived. There's some area someplace if you read a magazine or the Reader's Digest or something of the cleanest type of literature or somebody wrote an article and they were influenced and they watch this stuff. Somebody wrote a book or somebody wrote an article and their mind is completely contaminated and given over by it. It's not possible. And the prophet said it very clearly. It invades the platform &gt;&gt; because people are desiring entertainment because the whole world is bent that way. And so there has to be something in the service, something in our worship that's humorous. It doesn't have to be. It can be dead serious, friends. &gt;&gt; But this thing, this this spirit has literally washed over the face of the earth. And it came from people because I I say that when when uh when the people that are called of God, Israel, when they turn their back on God, there doesn't seem to be any restraints. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And you can find it in the scripture and you read Ezekiel 16 when you go home. You'll find it in the scripture. Maybe I'll just I'll I'll I'll read the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ezekiel 16:es 1 2 and 3 and then 47 and 51. Again the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man cause Jerusalem cause Jerusalem. Let hear everybody say Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. Jerusalem. the city of Zion where Mount Mariah is where the temple's to be rebuilt said cause them to know the her abomination and say thus sayith the Lord God unto Jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity in the land of Canaan thy father was an Amorite and thy mother was a Hittite &gt;&gt; in verse 47 yet and he's still carrying on the message God is giving this direct direct message to Ezekiel. Yet hast thou not walked after their ways? Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations, but as it were as if it were a very little thing, thou was corrupted more than they in all thy ways. Listen friends, here's a people and I say this. I'll say this as as a wash as a warning and a caution to all believers that hear this service. If we do nothing, if we just laxidasical, you know, just say, well, I'm going to just let the ministry carry me along. No, we are here to fight a great battle, &gt;&gt; and you have to fight your own battle. and we will also fight a battle together. But the but the I I have all my confidence in what the messenger has said. The bride of Jesus Christ cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; But but yet we can be the bride of Jesus Christ. We can be the elect of God. We can be the royal seed of Abraham and all of those things. God ground Abraham out. He allowed him to be ground out and he allow us to do that as well because the trial of our faith is more precious to him than gold. &gt;&gt; Verse 40 51 says, "Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins." Think of it. This godless Samaria, "Neither have they committed even half of your sins. But thou hast multiplied thine abomination more than they, and hast justified thy sisters, thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done. And if you go home and read it, then you'll say, I just want you to be mindful of of what Israel was to God, all the victories that God did, and all the promises that he gave, and yet where they managed to go to, and ask yourself, how did they ever get there? Well, they got there by letting down the bars. They got there little by little by, you know, just looking over the fence and and uh saying, "Well, it's not that bad." And they got there because because it's in it's in politics. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay with what he said. &gt;&gt; It's in your shopping malls. &gt;&gt; They've designed the clothes. &gt;&gt; It's in the barber shop. Is that where they got all our designs? All the fashion has birthed in Hollywood. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; It's in politics. &gt;&gt; The laws and the regulations that come down are imposed upon believers &gt;&gt; and we have to deal with it. We have to honor that. And nevertheless, it's not it didn't come from a godly king or a godly government politics. And you want to if you doubt what I say, just go and find out what the prophet has said about it. It's corrupted and rotten to the core. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I go on for about another five or 10 minutes? I want you to notice in this next in this next words that brother Brandham speaks and I've just given a heading to it. Corrupting the minds of the people and the minds is the battleground. And that's why I say that I'm going to show you some pictures of some battlegrounds &gt;&gt; that that are remain after some wars fought and after humans with their human artillery and bombs and whatever more what they were left with. What do you think God's left with? And there had to be a mind. There had to be a there had to be a mutual meeting ground for these two forces. And he said there's only two. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; There had to be a place chosen. And if you got a mind, your mind was chosen. &gt;&gt; The human mind was chosen for this battle to take place. And I'm here tonight to say every every instrument of war that the enemy has in his artillery &gt;&gt; has been blasted into the human mind from every direction. Every bomb he has has been dropped on the human mind. And the fact that you and I are engaged in a lot of warfare and mental pressure, it's that's why. And don't think for a minute that you're the only one. The one sitting next to you has it. The preacher has it. &gt;&gt; The kids have it. The seniors have it. We all have it. &gt;&gt; We're in a warfare. &gt;&gt; We're engaged in a great warfare. But this one, God is already sealed with a victory for the believer. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen friends. I this is a real this is a real message &gt;&gt; and I am in a mortal warfare with the enemy. &gt;&gt; I counsel people but I realize when we're in counseling there's a warfare going on and people have real problems. They have real pressures. Some almost seem insoluble. There's an enemy out there. And I say let's not let's not take advice from him. &gt;&gt; Let's take advice from this word of God. And this scriptur's got the advice for every person under the sound of my voice today. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's too bad that the things of the world has so captured the church in these days." And don't don't forget that this was actually in in ' 62 and right over here in our capital city, Victoria, is where he preached it. I was sitting there on the platform. I get more out of it today than I did then. &gt;&gt; It's too bad that the things of the world have so captured the church in these days and Satan had a rude way of doing it to bringing in the television right into the homes and things and corrupting the minds of the people. Now we might have a phone or we might have a iPod or iPad or whatever more but just don't forget don't forget for a moment that it's a that it's the ingenuity of Satan and the deception of Satan. He invented these things not for your convenience. He invented them for corruption. &gt;&gt; He invented them to devastate the mind of the believer. &gt;&gt; The unbeliever he's already got them. &gt;&gt; Are you with me friends? That's why they've been invented. &gt;&gt; Not for your convenience, &gt;&gt; not to make things easier, not to make your school and your studies easier or your business easier. He invented it for one thing, that's corruption. &gt;&gt; He is a destroyer by nature. &gt;&gt; He's a destroyer by nature. He cometh not but for to steal &gt;&gt; and to kill and to destroy. &gt;&gt; That's the words of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Young men, young women, older people, it doesn't He has no He has no age lines whatsoever. He doesn't care. He's out to corrupt the people. &gt;&gt; And the message is no boundary for him. He invades right in. In fact is if he could get the believers to become entertainmentminded that that's where it first starts to get loosened up. Maybe even good gospel music and and it turns into from worship to entertainment. &gt;&gt; We we're afraid of that. &gt;&gt; We don't want entertainment. &gt;&gt; We want worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the only one we want to worship him. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for you, friends, because I I I know that you're receiving it and supporting it. It's to corrupt the the mind of the people, the mind where the warfare between God and Satan is taking place. And by corrupting the mind of the people, he's trying to get an advantage against God. And he's trying to go contrary to the scripture which says let this mind be in you which was also in Jesus Christ. He says, "Until that day that a great percent of the church that call themselves Christians would stay home from prayer meeting on a Wednesday night uh or a Friday night to get to see some favorite program or somebody from Hollywood or somewhere that oughten to even be on the screen, maybe living with three or four husbands or wives and carrying on and living all kinds of lives and go out to drunk parties and smoking and lying and everything that can be done that's wrong. I'm almost ashamed to say this over this pullpit, but I became aware and I have not read anything. I just became aware that there's a there's a I don't know whether it's a company, but there's a a a man and his organization right in Hollywood and his whole business is set up if somebody wants to have a party. They can just tell them what kind of party they want. We want to have a big whoopdedoo. We want to have a party. We've got big guys coming. We've got we got celebrities coming. It's all celebrities we want. And he described, and I did not even read it, but he described how vile and how vulgar, how evil, and how wicked, and how perverted they wanted. And he get it just as perverted as they want, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And all they have to do is order it like you order a wedding cake or you order something else. They just order that kind of party and he and he produces all the people for it. If they said they want them naked, they'll be there naked. I'm talking about naked. &gt;&gt; If he wants beauties, beautiful celebrities, if he wants the most beautiful girls in the country, he'll produce them. And however many they want, that's Hollywood. &gt;&gt; And you think God's going to preserve that place? He's going to let it go below the bottom of this ocean. And quite frankly, I can't wait till it happens. &gt;&gt; And people have, you know, people get nervous about being a believer here on the West Coast or whatever more. I tell you, if you're in the middle of God's will, if you know that God brought you to a certain place, you just give your whole heart, soul, and body to the God that called you, you're the you're safer than anybody. &gt;&gt; If you're in the middle of God's will, the atomic bomb could drop right on your head. you're safer than the other people that got bomb shelters or whatever. Do you believe what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; This is not a spur of the moment. Friends say &gt;&gt; they shouldn't even be on a screen living with three or four husbands or wives and carrying on and and living all kinds of lives and go out drunk parties and smoking and lying and everything that can be done. That's wrong. And our churches are fashioning And our churches are fashioning their yourself. Even our dress in this day becomes after Hollywood. What a pity it's got to be. That our minds, our minds, our minds, let this mind. That's what the scripture says. Let this mind. It's not this mind that came out of Hollywood. I'm trying to trying to just show the people today and whoever is listening or whoever will hear it that Satan is using every possible enticement and they and in fact as he makes it look glamorous on on on top it's not glamorous underneath it's vile &gt;&gt; it's wicked &gt;&gt; and Satan is wanting to get the human mind because that's the battleground &gt;&gt; he said even our dress in this day becomes after Hollywood. What a pity it's got to be that our minds think and can't stay pure and holy with Christ. He said it's done something to the church. And I have this double underlined here highlighted. It's done something to the church. It's crippled it. And it's done a horrible thing. All of our papers and everything just seems to be corrupted. But listen friends, it's in the hour of corruption that the time of corrup and the time of corruption that God draws himself a bride. Listen to what he's saying. It's in that time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said another place, why is it so dark? Because the light has arrived and it's compressing the darkness back to where it come from. The message came to send this darkness back to hell &gt;&gt; because it came from hell and the light is going to send it back to hell. &gt;&gt; That's according to the word of glory. &gt;&gt; God in the beginning didn't say let there be darkness. No, that was dark. He said let there be light. &gt;&gt; And what's the scripture say? And there was light. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said it's he uses the word it's compressing the darkness &gt;&gt; back to where it came from. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And he said it's in the hour of corruption. &gt;&gt; So this doesn't put a cloud over my day when I hear how wicked, how vile. I say fill your cup. &gt;&gt; Be as wicked. go after all of your stuff and the filth and all the rest of it because my prophet has said in that hour. Hallelujah. In that hour, he's going to call a bride out of it. Why? Because that makes him more powerful. &gt;&gt; He's showing the victory of Calvary again. when Satan, his enemy, was defeated and turned loose and he's gone out to to deceive the whole world in the church world and everywhere. He's defeated. He's He's deceived it. And in that hour, God calls his bride out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'll tell you what, God, he pulls one over on Satan because right in the middle of that filth, there isn't anybody that could think anything could come out of there pure. But he calls out a pure one because it's by the power of his blood that was shed back there that she's absolutely spotless without spot and without wrinkle or any such thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it's in that hour God draws himself a bride that comes out of that corruption. And that's why he's looking and that's what he's looking for to get a church that's called by his name. Somebody that looks for life &gt;&gt; that has no end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was and I was so touched by some of these things. Brother Benham says his seventh vision when he told this he said five of them are already been fulfilled and he said I see in the United States as one smoldering burnt over place &gt;&gt; and it will be near the end. &gt;&gt; That's in combination by representation. The very thing that turned this age lukewarm came out of Hollywood spewed all over the entire world from the theater into their homes and now into the hand or the pocket or the purse and we all have that. That's why the age this age had to be called to live the life of Jesus Christ in the midst of all of this. And he says in the angel in the commission now he said just shake yourself a little bit and pinch your minds or pinch your inside part. See what he's saying to the people back then. You know how early he was saying it 60 years ago. He was telling the people to pinch your mind, trying to get them to see they didn't they didn't even dream of the stuff that you and I have today. &gt;&gt; They didn't even dream that that would exist. &gt;&gt; Look how far we've come in just a very short time. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to start at about slide five. Well, no. No. Let's say I'll just I'll just run through this with you. Can we dim the lights a wee bit now? If id had time and we'll leave it for another time. But when you think of the no doubt every person here can identify some hardship or some trial and brother Kyle you were just praying and there was it was silent in the study because the volume wasn't on and I just reached up and turned the volume on and you were in prayer and you were saying in the trials and these emotional upheavalss that was the first phrase that came over and it was such a confirmation and then you went on and someone else has made a reference to it. There isn't anybody and under the sound of my voice and and the enemy would like us to think, well, mine's the worst. Mine's the worst. I don't know whether I'll make it. Yeah, you'll make it. &gt;&gt; You want to start rejoicing in the face of it. &gt;&gt; It's in this very hour. &gt;&gt; It's at this very time that God wants to prove himself. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be a coward. I'm not going to cower to this stuff. the ages. The saints came through it all and we're going to go through it all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you're living in the midst of devastation. &gt;&gt; And the and the instruction which we read today in Titus, and I'm just drawing it quickly to a close, but now I want you to notice in view of what I've spoken. Speak thou the things which become sound doctrine. Not easy. We speak all kinds of stuff. &gt;&gt; That's a message in itself. Be sober or be vigilant or be watchful. Be temperate, grave, sound in faith and in charity and in patience. Be in behavior as becometh holiness. Speaking to the women, not false accusers. Not even not given to much wine. Teachers of good things. To be sober. To love their husbands. Not easy sometime. To love their children. Not easy. Sometime you say, "Well, what does it take?" Probably, you know, some chastening. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get two. Be discreet, chase, keepers at home. Is this all right? &gt;&gt; I read the scripture. &gt;&gt; Good, obedient to their own husbands at the word of God be not blasphemed. Young men likewise. Young man, &gt;&gt; Almighty God's addressing the young men. &gt;&gt; Likewise, exhort to be sober minded or vigilant, watchful in all things, showing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine, showing unccorruptness, gravity, sincerity. You want to read Titus the 2 chapter and just you'll when you get to the end of it, you won't find it to be just all that simple and easy. Why doesn't this want to go to the next one? All right. Sound speech that cannot be condemned, and that he that is of the contrary part might be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters and to please them well in all things, not answering again, not perlloining, but showing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of God our savior in all things teaching us. I'll just skip that one, please. Let's go to All right. Well, you can read this. Uh, teaching is that word which I was giving you. To learn, to teach, to instruct, to train children, to be instructed, to cause one to learn, to chastise with words or to instruct with words, to correct of those who are molding the character of others by reproof and admonition. Now, listen, I I know we have uh teenagers and children and you young people and kids here. If you got a godly parent or a godly person, just might be an elder in the church, someone older than yourself, might be an older young man, and they're telling you or your parents especially, and they're telling you, I want to I want to speak to all all the people here. Listen to that sound advice. And if it it kind of puts a kink into your, you know, into your way of doing things and so on, you just surrender to it. If it's a good godly council, you just surrender to it because it's it's for our benefit. &gt;&gt; It's for our benefit. I just want to show a little bit of destruction here. Uh we don't need any notes. Brother Bramman talks about nothing but smoldering stumps. This is what man has done. There's two boys up there. I don't know where they lived. Probably doesn't exist today or when they when they're looking at it. That's a lot of apartments. That's a lot of buildings. That's what man did. He just dropped that man in a piece of tin. I didn't want to be too dramatic, but you ought to hear brother Brham speaking from a pulpit and talking about the other dimension that he's in and describing describing the very the very makeup describing the appearance of demons as they've left people. &gt;&gt; Right. someone with long hair hanging down over their legs like that. And he he brings out the one that's epileptic and he describes that demon. And he describes a a demon of oppression. &gt;&gt; You know, we have all kinds of nice this civilization has given you nice legal phrases, has given you nice medical phrases. Don't forget in all likelihood it's a devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. And in that other dimension, it's much more real than these bombed out cities. &gt;&gt; And he's out to destroy the battleground of the mind. &gt;&gt; I hope you can see what I'm talking about, friends. &gt;&gt; Battleground. You got one right here. &gt;&gt; Battleground. That's right. &gt;&gt; And Satan wants to put thoughts there. He wants to inspire you to think about the wrong things. And if you think about the wrong things, you'll likely say the wrong things. And if you say the wrong things and think the wrong things, you'll likely do the wrong things. And that's exactly what he's desiring to do. And I'm appealing with everything that's in me. Resist the devil. &gt;&gt; Resist him at his first at his first inclination of being around you. And sometimes you just feel so, well, it's kind of a down day. It's not just a down day. It's a devil day. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; These are all different places. These are different countries. &gt;&gt; These are places that were invaded. And I don't want you to go home unless you have this thought. God sent the spirit of Elijah to tell a country who had never experienced this. And when they had 911, the whole country, you you fly on an airplane, take off your shoes, take off your belt, remove everything out of your pocket. And I'm insulted &gt;&gt; when they make you walk in, hold your hands up in the air, and you're essentially stripped naked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You folks might as well say, "Amen." That's exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; You talk about taking your liberties away. &gt;&gt; You talk about going against the word of God. I doubt very much whether that is appealing to God. &gt;&gt; And I have spoken. My wife says, "Don't say anything." I said, "Well, I have to." And I go through, I have a pretty much a common phrase. If I can get some of their ears, I say, "You can thank 19 Arabs." And they think I'm some wacko. I never did this. Take off my shoes every time. It's harder to do. And take off your jacket. Put it in a tray. Put off your your computer over in another tray. Take out all the metal. Got any coin. What? What is that? That's just my billfold. Take hold it in your hand. Or put it in a tray. And then you go on and I forgot my passport. I forgot something. And they yell you left something. Well, I got so many trays full of stuff. Hey, you might say, well, that's just Oh, no. It's not just that. It's part of this age. &gt;&gt; It all had a beginning someplace. &gt;&gt; And when America lost their two world towers, it changed life for everybody forever. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the truth? &gt;&gt; That is absolutely the truth, friends. &gt;&gt; I'm over my time, but I just want to punch this home. And that's the worst. And and you could say it. It's just I I've watched those films and the and the documentary they've done on it and to see 110 stories. I've been in New York. I've been in the 58th floor. I think of the of the Panama building and looking right out over the Hudson River and so on. It was just phenomenal. I can't imagine what was it to be up a 110 stories and have that thing implode on itself and come down and the second one come down. And not only the second one, there's others that don't talk very much about. &gt;&gt; Say, is this a message? Yeah, that's a message. &gt;&gt; That's that's feel it. This the first time it's come to America. No, it's not the first time. If America had recognized it, she had a prophet raise up and speak of the invasion of America. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he even said where the seat was and the devil sits there in Hollywood &gt;&gt; and he's going to spew the stuff out until people's minds the real battleground. It's not the battleground of United States. It's not the soil of United States. You're much more precious than the dirt. &gt;&gt; This dirt's more precious than the dirt of Canada, United States, or any state in the union. I hope you don't think I'm off my &gt;&gt; rocker. &gt;&gt; That's absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; I'm saying things because it's been inside for a long time. &gt;&gt; And people have been waiting. When do you think that the seventh vision is is going to be fulfilled? You might say, "Are you telling us that it's already fulfilled?" Well, I would I would cast my vote on the battleground of the mind over this one. Amen. &gt;&gt; This one's not hard to figure out. &gt;&gt; This one, there's not much deception to this one. &gt;&gt; But when you have a battleground that's worse than that and it's already around you and you don't think anything's wrong, that to me is a a battleground that Satan has done. &gt;&gt; And what do you think the mind looks like? What do you think this battleground looks like when the prophet says the streets will be full of neurotics, &gt;&gt; insane people? &gt;&gt; What made them that way? &gt;&gt; The civilization that Satan, the god of this evil age, has done. &gt;&gt; I think this is one that Hbomb, as far as you can see, there's nothing. I could have showed you the picture &gt;&gt; actually of the of the bomb. Doesn't look very dangerous. There's a great big round canister &gt;&gt; maybe from here to the wall along just picking it up with a A-frame hoist and loading it on the plane. And before that trip was over, that's what they had. And I'm I'm pretty well done, friends. It's a a sobering thought, but you have you you're going to walk out of this building tonight with a battleground. And God is providing you some protection. &gt;&gt; God is providing you with equipment. God is providing you with artillery that is greater than anything that man has conceived. &gt;&gt; God has given you the protection for your soul, &gt;&gt; body, mind. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Let's have the musicians. I My went way over my time. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Well, you didn't think we're going to turn that corner, did you? When we started out. I want to stand. Come, brother Derek. And I want us to sing standing on the promises of God, my savior. &gt;&gt; And friends, if you think for a minute that this is just something that's just casual, no, it's not something that's just casual because the prophet spoke all kinds of things. He spoke volumes about this. And I'm not not I'm I'm just alerting. I'm saying it to you as believers because you encounter this. You encounter it where you work. You encounter it in your family. You encounter with your children. And let's claim the promises of God. &gt;&gt; And if we don't, I fear for those that claim themselves as believers. We've got to claim we've got to claim our victory over these things. And we have to be aggressive about it. We have to be absolutely stalwart about it. &gt;&gt; I'm wanting to encourage you with faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And quite frankly, I want to see the young people of this congregation rise up and and and say, you know, there's something for me to do. And I don't know exactly what it is, but I'm going to I'm going to give and surrender up my energy. I'm going to be uh I'm going to be vigilant. I'm going to be alert. I'm going to encourage others. I'm going to be example to others. And I don't know what God's going to do with me, but I'm making myself available. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right, let's stand. &gt;&gt; Standing on the promises of Christ my king. &gt;&gt; Through eternal ages, let his praises ring. Glory in the highest. I will shout and sing. Standing on the promises of God. Listen now. Standing. I'm standing. Standing on the promises of God, my Savior. Standing. I'm standing. I'm standing on the promises of God. Standing on the promises. They cannot fail. When the howling storms of doubt and fear must sail, by the living word of God, I shall prevail. I'm standing on the promises of God. Standing. I'm standing. Standing on the promises of God, my savior. Standing. Standing. I'm standing on the promises of God. Standing on the promises I now can see perfect in the blood for me. Standing in the liberty where Christ free standing on the promises of God. Stand me, stand me. Standing on the promises of God my savior. Stand me. I'm standing on the promises of God. Standing on the promises of Christ my Lord. How to live eternally by strong. We're overcoming daily with the spirit. So we're standing on the promises of God. I'm standing standing standing on the promises of God my savior. Stand me. Stand me. I'm standing on the promises of God. I want to send you from this place tonight, friends, not having just preached a uh service, showed you a few uh pictures of this devastation. There were some that I I wasn't able to show. because it's just so horrific. &gt;&gt; And I often wonder I often wonder what what brother Brandham I wish he was standing here. I wonder what he was actually seeing when he was trying to describe to the people the spirits that were holding him in another realm. And I'm saying that to cause this congregation to be thankful, to rejoice, to love him more deeply that he's preserved you from that scene. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just bow in prayer. Heavenly Father, thank you for the armor. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the helmet of salvation. Thank you for the breastplate of faith, oh God, that can quench every fiery dart of the enemy. Thank you, oh God, that we are girded about our loins with truth and we're shaw with the preparation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. We are not afraid to make footprints. Not afraid to walk forward, oh God. And as I stand here and think of the years, Father, and the things that you have allowed me to experience, oh God, even from the youth, Lord, that I able to look down into the faces of these lovely young people, oh God, and be able to declare to them that there is no life like this life. This is the greatest gift that could be given to be given eternal life. and here in this life to be an example to be a representation of Jesus Christ in the darkest of all ages. Oh God, and your prophet saying that this would be the age he would choose to live in. And here we are. He has departed. He's he's fulfilled his calling. Whatever, oh God, you called for him to do. And here we are left with this message. We will not fail. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we'll lay hold of the sword of the word of of God. We'll use it in the daytime. We'll use it when we're confronted with the enemy. We'll use it, Lord, when the wrong thoughts come. We'll use it when sickness comes. We'll use it, Lord, when when infirmities come and all manner of things come. We'll use the sword of the word of God. We're thankful, Lord, not just for the Bible that millions and millions of people read, but you have given an interpretation to it. And so few have that. And some that do have it are not making access. They're not taking the the the access that they have to it. Lord, I pray that you will give them such a hunger. Father, oh God, give them such a hunger in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I pray that you'll bless the people, Father, and send them from this place with a great thankfulness within themselves that they've been called into this way. And may they go with this thanksgiving within them. I pray, Father, you'll watch over our homes. Watch over the people as they drive along the highway. You'll protect them from every evil, oh God. How we pray that every devil will be made subjective and that you'll cast him to the earth. You'll grind him down, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ through your people. We thank you, Father, in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Victory in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Victory in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Over every affliction. &gt;&gt; Over every temptation. &gt;&gt; Amen. over every pressure that you're going through, &gt;&gt; there's victory in our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I dismiss you in the name of the Lord Jesus. And Lord willing, we'll see you here on the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer meeting on Friday night and and come come Sunday and be in be in prayer for the meetings, will you? &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for staying 15 20 minutes over the time. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen.
