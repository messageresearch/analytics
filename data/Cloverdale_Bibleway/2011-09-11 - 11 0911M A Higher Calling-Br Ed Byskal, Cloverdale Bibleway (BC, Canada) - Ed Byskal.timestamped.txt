[0:38] yesterday and what may happen tomorrow
[0:41] pales in comparison.
[0:43] Amen. Spending eternity with our Lord.
[0:46] Let's sing this together this morning.
[0:49] Pending on the promises of Christ my
[0:53] king through eternal ages. Let his
[0:57] praises ring. All glory in the highest.
[1:01] I will shout and sing. Standing on the
[1:05] promises of God.
[1:08] Standing.
[1:11] Standing.
[1:13] Standing on the promises of God. My
[1:17] savior. Standing.
[1:20] Standing.
[1:24] I'm standing on the promises of God.
[1:29] Yes, I'm standing on the promises that
[1:32] cannot fail. When the howling storms of
[1:36] doubt and fear sail, by the living word
[1:40] of God, I shall prevail.
[1:44] Standing on the promises of God.
[1:48] Standing.
[1:50] Standing.
[1:53] Standing on the promises of God. My
[1:56] savior. Standing.
[2:00] Standing.
[2:03] I'm standing on the promises of God.
[2:09] Standing on the promises I now can see.
[2:14] Perfect present cleansing in the blood
[2:16] for me. Standing in the liberty where
[2:20] Christ makes free. Standing on the
[2:24] promises of God.
[2:27] Standing.
[2:30] Standing.
[2:32] Standing on the promises of God. My
[2:35] savior. Standing.
[2:39] Standing.
[2:42] I'm standing on the promises of God.
[2:48] Standing on the promises of Christ the
[2:51] Lord bow to him eternally by low
[2:55] stronghold.
[2:57] Hallelujah.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm standing on the promises
[3:04] of God.
[3:06] Standing,

[3:10] standing on the promises of God, my
[3:14] savior. Standing,
[3:17] standing,
[3:21] I'm standing on the promises of God.
[3:25] Last verse, we're standing on the
[3:28] promises. I cannot fall. Listening every
[3:32] moment to the spirit song. Resting in my
[3:37] savior as my all in all. Standing on the
[3:41] promises of God.
[3:44] Oh, standing
[3:47] standing
[3:49] standing on the promises of God. My
[3:53] savior. Standing
[3:56] standing.
[4:00] I'm standing on the promises of God.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Springs of living water
[4:08] number 759.
[4:18] I thirsted in the barren land of sin and
[4:23] shame and nothing satisfying there I
[4:27] found.
[4:30] But to the blessed cross of Christ, one
[4:33] day I came where springs of living
[4:37] water.
[4:48] Are you happy this morning? My soul is
[4:50] satisfied.
[4:52] I'm drinking at the strength of living
[4:55] God.
[4:57] Oh, and bountiful supply of life.
[5:03] I'll stream the living water from the
[5:06] hills of God. It makes me glad and happy
[5:11] all the way.
[5:14] Now, glory, grace, and blessing mark the
[5:17] path I've tried. I'm shouting hallelujah
[5:22] every day.
[5:25] I'm drinking endless streams of living
[5:28] water.
[5:31] Happy now am I. My soul is satisfied.
[5:36] I'm drinking at the springs of living
[5:39] water.
[5:41] Oh, wonderful and bountiful of life.
[5:47] Oh sinner, won't you come today to
[5:50] Calary?
[5:52] A fountain there is flowing deep and
[5:55] wide.
[5:58] The Savior now invites you to the water
[6:02] free.
[6:06] Oh, thank you Lord for drinking drinking
[6:09] at the living water.
[6:14] Happy now.
[6:17] My soul is satisfied.
[6:20] Drinking at the springs of living water.
[6:26] Maybe we should stand lifted up this
[6:29] morning. Oh, we're drinking at the
[6:32] strength of living water.
[6:41] We're drinking at the springs of living
[6:44] water.
[6:46] Oh, wonderful and bountiful supply.
[6:52] Hallelujah.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; This is my desire.
[7:01] This is my desire
[7:06] to honor
[7:10] you,
[7:13] &gt;&gt; Lord. With all my heart,
[7:18] I worship you. We worship you.
[7:25] All I have within
[7:31] I give you praise.
[7:37] All that I adore
[7:42] is in.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, can we sing that again?
[7:49] This is my desire
[7:54] to honor.

[7:59] morning. Lord, with all my heart,

[8:28] is in you.
[8:36] Lord, I give you my heart.
[8:39] I give you my soul.
[8:44] I live for you alone.

[9:30] oh Lord.
[9:33] Oh,

[9:40] my
[9:41] meditation.
[9:47] Hearken unto the voice
[9:51] of my cry,
[9:56] my king
[9:59] and my God.
[10:06] For unto
[10:08] thee will I pray.
[10:15] Thy voice shall thou me.
[10:19] In the morning,
[10:24] oh Lord, in the morning
[10:29] will I direct my prayer
[10:33] unto thee and will
[10:43] give you
[10:45] to my words. Oh,

[10:58] hearts this morning.

[11:13] and my God.
[11:19] For unto
[11:21] thee will I pray.
[11:27] My voice shall thou hear
[11:32] in the morning.

[11:41] will I direct my prayer unto thee and
[11:48] will.

[12:06] will
[12:08] look.

[12:19] morning, Lord. We look to you, the
[12:21] author and finisher of our faith.
[12:25] We're inviting you to this service this
[12:27] morning, oh God.
[12:29] That you would have your perfect will in
[12:31] your way done. You would speak to the
[12:34] hearts of your children once more.
[12:37] Hallelujah.

[12:41] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[12:44] Lord.
[12:46] Ask brother Kyle Morton to come and open
[12:49] the service in a word of prayer.
[12:53] Brother Hugh message wants us to
[12:55] remember a gentleman that has asked that
[12:58] we pray for him great need in his life
[13:01] that God will grant him the desire of
[13:04] his heart according with God's will for
[13:07] his life. Amen. If you have a need upon
[13:09] your heart this morning, maybe make it
[13:11] known by the uplifted hand. Amen.
[13:13] Brother Kyle, why don't you come?
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we love you. We're so
[13:22] thankful for salvation, Lord. That you
[13:24] saved us from our sins and our
[13:26] trespasses, God. We just wandered around
[13:28] this world clueless, Lord, but you you
[13:30] saved us, God. And I'm so thankful for
[13:32] that, Lord Jesus. God, you gave us a
[13:34] down payment, Father. And we're looking
[13:36] forward to receiving our full
[13:37] inheritance, Lord Jesus. Oh, God. The
[13:40] world is in such a awful state, Lord.
[13:42] You see it, Lord, all over the globe in
[13:44] the Middle East, God. And Father, even
[13:46] in New York today, Lord Jesus, but oh
[13:47] God, we know that you're in control,
[13:50] Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, we have
[13:52] confidence in you, oh God. We may not
[13:53] understand everything, Father, but we
[13:55] know that you're in control and that you
[13:56] love us, God. And Father, we love you
[13:58] with all our mind and our heart and our
[14:00] soul and our strength, Jesus. Where
[14:02] we're weary, Lord, where we're burdened,
[14:04] where we're tired, Lord, where we fail,
[14:05] Father, may you just give us strength,
[14:07] Lord. Pour in the oil, Lord. pour in the
[14:09] wine, Lord Jesus. And help us continue
[14:11] on down the path, oh God. Just just a
[14:13] little bit longer to go, God. Let that
[14:15] that second wind come inside of us, God.
[14:18] And Father, just raise up the weary,
[14:20] God. Help those who are in need, Lord
[14:22] Jesus, whether it's financial, God, or
[14:24] in their body, Father. Oh, God. You're
[14:26] more than able, Lord.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, you own the cattle on a thousand
[14:29] hills, Father. And you created the the
[14:30] heavens and the earth, Lord, with no
[14:32] problem. It didn't even cause you to
[14:33] sweat, God. You're so mighty and
[14:35] powerful, Lord Jesus. and that you're so
[14:37] humble that you have such a desire to
[14:39] come amongst us this morning, oh God,
[14:40] and to speak through us through our
[14:42] pastor, God. I just pray that you'd help
[14:44] him, Lord. Give him strength, Father.
[14:46] Give him liberty. May he find that
[14:48] channel, God, just above and beyond his
[14:49] notes just to be able to speak to us,
[14:51] God. And may you be able to receive it,
[14:53] Father, and walk out these doors
[14:55] stronger, Lord, uplifted, God, more able
[14:57] to live in this wicked world. And
[14:59] Father, would you help the prayer
[15:00] request, Lord, for the human message,
[15:02] this man, God? Oh, Father, just reach
[15:04] out to him, Lord Jesus. So reach out to
[15:05] all the unspoken prayer requests on our
[15:07] hearts, God. You know, our families and
[15:09] different things, God, but we we thank
[15:11] you, Lord, and we love you. We
[15:12] appreciate that you've allowed us to
[15:14] come here this day, Lord. May we give it
[15:16] to you, Lord. The afternoon and the
[15:17] evening service. May you just be
[15:19] glorified and honored in all we say and
[15:20] do, Lord. We love you in Jesus name.
[15:23] Amen.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. As you
[15:29] have your seats,
[15:31] I have a couple of announcements to go
[15:33] over with you real briefly. We have a

[29:32] come down and just uh uh
[29:37] say a word.
[29:39] I tried to think of a phrase that would
[29:41] encompass Brother Kim's trip. And I came
[29:45] up with a phrase. I think it's very
[29:46] fitting. God was with him.
[29:51] Isn't that all we need?
[29:53] &gt;&gt; If I could say to you this coming week,
[29:56] God will be with you.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; Everything's okay.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[30:03] Kim. I just wanted to have him say a
[30:06] word about that. And then uh I want to I
[30:09] just just got this from China within
[30:12] probably the last hour and I want to say
[30:15] a word about that. I want to say a word

[30:25] going to be gone for about 2 or 3 months

[30:33] here, the congregation that is
[30:36] streaming,

[30:42] and honor to be entrusted that we could
[30:45] have men and send resources
[30:49] send our prayers and lift these people
[30:52] into the presence of God
[30:54] &gt;&gt; by our prayer.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; And for us to worship around that
[30:57] &gt;&gt; we're worshiping today not only because
[30:59] God is here but because God is there.

[31:04] &gt;&gt; Not only that God is with us but God is
[31:06] with them.

[31:25] it's certainly good to be home among the
[31:27] saints here. Um but you know, when you
[31:30] travel and you're spending time with
[31:32] believers, you always feel at home. I
[31:33] felt as at home in India as I do here
[31:36] because when you're in the presence of
[31:37] the Lord, you're at home.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I told the believers that when I
[31:41] was there at Brother Isaac's church. I
[31:42] said, "I feel so at home here because I
[31:44] always feel at home in the presence of
[31:45] the Lord, you know."
[31:47] &gt;&gt; So, we uh I don't even know what day we
[31:49] left. It's been a blur for me for the
[31:51] last couple of weeks. Anybody know what
[31:53] day I left?
[31:56] I can't remember what day I left. Um but
[31:58] we left. We spent a couple of days
[32:00] getting there. Um it was a it was a rush
[32:03] trip so unfortunately we weren't even be
[32:05] able to get a a comfortable itinerary so
[32:08] we just had to take what we could get.
[32:09] So we uh we left took a couple of days
[32:11] to get there and then um the the purpose
[32:15] of the trip we're just making a major
[32:18] transition in India as you know we had
[32:20] for many many years 30 years or more a
[32:23] printing operation and uh you know doing
[32:26] work there was a printing operation in
[32:28] Chennai with the Glattis DA memorial
[32:30] building that was there and a large
[32:32] printing operation with the large press
[32:34] and uh we're just making a big
[32:36] transition in India now how we
[32:38] distribute the message. And so the last
[32:41] time I was there, we sold the printing
[32:43] equipment and we've been dispersing the
[32:45] inventory of books all around the world.
[32:47] There was almost a million books in
[32:49] stock when we when we went and uh we've
[32:52] been sending books all over India. The
[32:54] books are better in the hands of the
[32:56] believers that speak the language than
[32:58] they are on the shelf on the other side
[32:59] of the country.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; So we've been shipping the books out um
[33:03] all all over the country. we were left
[33:06] over with close to a 100,000 English
[33:08] books that they didn't have much need
[33:10] for in India. So they those are being
[33:12] shipped as we speak to West Africa to uh
[33:16] go to Ghana to all the believers that
[33:18] are are in need of books in West Africa
[33:20] in uh in the English language. So when
[33:24] when we when we arrived we had some uh
[33:27] it you know doing a transaction in India
[33:29] you know I've done many land
[33:30] transactions but you know this was a
[33:31] learning experience for me to uh go to
[33:34] go to India we sold the Glattis Dal
[33:36] memorial building and uh with the
[33:39] intention of setting up a a new
[33:41] distribution in uh in Chennai for that
[33:43] region and more regional distribution
[33:46] for the message as opposed to one
[33:48] centralized location in Chennai. So we
[33:51] went to sell the building and of course
[33:53] you know it's altogether different than
[33:54] here in here land titles keeps all the
[33:58] records for all the transactions from
[33:59] the land. In India the land titles
[34:02] doesn't keep any of that. They actually
[34:04] when you when you post a transaction
[34:06] they give a copy of it back to you and
[34:08] then you have to keep that copy forever.
[34:10] And so if I sell you a piece of land I
[34:13] need to prove that I actually bought it
[34:15] and the person back. So they call those
[34:17] parent documents and they go all the way
[34:18] back to the 50s. So those were all
[34:21] locked up in a safe deposit box that we
[34:23] didn't have access to just because of
[34:25] the way things were. And we tried last
[34:27] time to get access to those documents
[34:28] and couldn't. And this time we found
[34:30] bank uh favor with the bank manager and
[34:32] he went to the person in charge and he
[34:34] just said open that box. And they we
[34:36] were able to get the we were able to get
[34:38] the documents and and and make the land
[34:40] transaction. And uh at the same time the
[34:43] brothers had identified another piece of
[34:45] property to purchase to put up another
[34:47] building. So, so those of you who have
[34:50] been involved in a building project here
[34:51] for the last year or so, about the time
[34:54] we're finished here, you can all come to
[34:55] India and we're going to build another
[34:56] one in India.
[34:59] Little different construction method,
[35:00] but you're all welcome to come and join
[35:02] in on that project. So, we've identified
[35:04] that that piece of property and have an
[35:07] engineer working there to do some
[35:08] drawings and get ready for us. So, we'll
[35:10] start construction of that later this
[35:12] year. And uh brother Isaac um
[35:17] has a trustee in his church uh his name
[35:19] is brother Michael who's been on the
[35:21] board over there for a number of years
[35:23] and he's just uh between the burden that
[35:26] brother Isaac has to get it to get the
[35:28] message out. You know when I spent time
[35:30] with brother Isaac I felt like I was
[35:32] with brother Biscllow or brother
[35:33] Hildebrand the way their desire is to
[35:35] see the word just pushed pushed out to
[35:37] all the all the different believers.
[35:39] Brother Isaac is just working working.
[35:41] He's a busy man. He goes uh you know he
[35:44] he he preaches in his own church three
[35:46] times a week. Then he preaches outreach
[35:48] services almost every day in different
[35:50] different cities and uh you know they've
[35:52] established many works all over all over
[35:54] their area of India in the south of
[35:56] India and they've uh you know been
[35:58] building churches. I went to I went to
[36:00] one of the churches. I mean it was a
[36:02] church building that they put up. It had
[36:05] uh it was about a 2,000 square foot
[36:07] church that holds three or 4 hundred
[36:08] people and uh it just you know it just
[36:11] to to see the maturity there you know
[36:14] the deacons are in place and the
[36:15] trustees and the ministry and and just
[36:17] it just an absolutely established an
[36:19] established work there from that center
[36:21] where the word will be able to go out
[36:23] from they're currently involved in three
[36:25] building projects right now building
[36:27] three churches across the southern part
[36:29] of India and I'm saying that because you
[36:32] know if you felt to contribute to that
[36:33] that would be a wonderful thing. Um, for
[36:36] about $22,000, they can put up a a a
[36:39] building that's about 2,000 square ft
[36:41] and and they're putting up really nice
[36:43] nicely finished buildings. It's a, you
[36:45] know, a brick and mortar building. So
[36:47] those those projects are going on
[36:49] throughout India and uh it was a it was
[36:52] it was really a a good trip from a
[36:54] standpoint of moving forward with where
[36:57] we want to move with getting the message
[36:58] out across the country but also spending
[37:01] time among some of the believers and
[37:03] just seeing you know I I went to India
[37:05] the first time in 1983 and so to be
[37:08] there now and to see the maturity of the
[37:10] believers like to be in the congregation
[37:12] there you felt as at home as you were
[37:14] here you know the the presence of the
[37:16] Lord or the level of the ministry of the
[37:18] word, the the the lives of the people,
[37:20] the dedication. Um, it just it it it was
[37:23] a real encouragement to me to to see
[37:26] that. So, uh, Brother Michael has, uh,
[37:30] been running the affairs of the William
[37:33] Brandham Good News Society is what the
[37:34] what it's called there in India, um,
[37:37] since, uh, since I was there last time.
[37:40] And, you know, communication's a little
[37:41] spotty with the people in India. So, you
[37:43] know, we're we were wondering here, you
[37:44] know, how are things going? What's going
[37:46] on? a few spotty emails back and forth.
[37:47] When I got there, I just rejoiced to
[37:50] find out that they had translated,
[37:51] printed, and distributed 20 messages in
[37:54] the last about nine months.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; So, that was really exciting. They're
[37:57] doing Hindi um they're doing Hindi,
[38:00] Tamil, and Telugu messages and printing
[38:03] them and sending them out. And and the
[38:05] difference now with the churches being a
[38:07] little bit more more mature, what
[38:08] they're doing is um every time they
[38:11] print, they translate and then they
[38:12] print a few thousand copies of a book
[38:14] and they they find a church somewhere in
[38:17] southern India that sponsors each
[38:18] individual book and they print their
[38:20] name on the back and out they go. So the
[38:22] local the local believers in India have
[38:25] have really stepped up and are really
[38:28] you know um hopefully making us obsolete
[38:31] over there you know as the as they take
[38:33] ownership and they take they take the
[38:35] ownership for the drive to actually get
[38:37] the message out. So seeing that level of
[38:39] maturity happening among the body there
[38:41] in India was that was the exciting part
[38:44] for me on on this particular trip. So,
[38:46] we just ask that the Lord be with them.
[38:48] And like I say, they're uh they're
[38:50] they're not really even asking for help.
[38:52] Uh they just finished a church that was
[38:54] that was one of these churches that they
[38:56] built. They raised all the funds within
[38:58] India to get that one done. And uh you
[39:01] know, just among all the believers in
[39:02] India, but you know, there's there
[39:04] they've got more people that need
[39:06] churches than they can actually get
[39:07] done. So, you know, any help that we
[39:10] could offer and and of course, one of
[39:11] the there's there's a brother who got
[39:13] saved about 4 years ago and and uh he's
[39:17] actually running the the construction
[39:19] projects for them and they're doing the
[39:21] projects much like what we're doing next
[39:23] door. Um sometime maybe we'll show you a
[39:26] video of it. Um
[39:28] it would be an encouragement to you
[39:29] sisters to realize there are things you
[39:31] can do. You know, over there you see
[39:33] these sisters and they're you remember
[39:34] how we pumped the concrete here? We had
[39:36] that big machine and pumped the
[39:37] concrete. Well, the way they pump
[39:38] concrete is the brothers mix the
[39:39] concrete in the machine. They pour it on
[39:41] the ground and then the sister puts it
[39:43] in a bucket which passes to the next
[39:44] sister up up all the way up to the top
[39:47] and they pour it in and they just they
[39:48] were doing a whole slab 2,000 square ft
[39:51] like that, you know. So, uh and and the
[39:54] whole church involved the pastor's wife,
[39:56] you know, um carrying gravel on the top
[39:59] of her head in a in a in a in in a pan
[40:00] and and the whole church just completely
[40:03] involved. So when you see that, you
[40:06] really want to get behind and do what
[40:07] you can to help them. Like the one
[40:09] project is just getting a little bit
[40:11] stalled right now because they're just
[40:12] short on funds. They're all standing
[40:14] there willing to work. And like I say,
[40:15] when you look at the group that's
[40:16] working, I think there's probably 200 or
[40:19] so people in the church and there was
[40:20] 150 of them on the site working.
[40:22] Everybody from the little kids to the
[40:24] they were all just there working
[40:25] together. And so when you see that,
[40:27] that's not people just sitting back
[40:29] saying, "Well, I hope somebody builds a
[40:31] church for us." you know, they're just
[40:33] all working towards it and doing what
[40:34] they can and and so uh it was it was
[40:37] wonderful to see and wonderful to be a
[40:39] part of. So, we'll like to give you a
[40:40] little more information a little later.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; God bless.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Well, we're privileged. Uh, I don't
[40:55] regret I don't regret for a moment all
[40:59] the 30 years we've been laboring there.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[41:07] &gt;&gt; I know 30 years sounds like a long time,
[41:09] but it's gone by just like that. And we
[41:12] don't regret one moment of it. Uh, just
[41:15] quickly, if I can just take this moment,
[41:18] please.
[41:19] Brother Murphy just sent this. He said,
[41:22] "I just finished the meeting in Da Dao
[41:25] Dhou Sichuan province and then he's
[41:29] going down to Sanzen tomorrow."
[41:32] Uh he said, "By God's grace, I've been
[41:35] ministering uh just the word and asked
[41:38] the people to keep their eyes uh keep
[41:41] their eyes heavenly, not earthly." And I
[41:45] thought that was good. He also went and
[41:47] met Sister Asenth's mother. And she has,
[41:51] as you know, she's been struggling with
[41:54] cancer. But brother Ivan told me last
[41:57] night that his his mother, who's a
[41:59] doctor, Brother Ivan's mother is a
[42:01] doctor and has been checking her and
[42:03] saying that she's been getting stronger
[42:06] uh all the time.
[42:08] And uh Brother Murphy said that the
[42:11] cancer cells in her lung is under
[42:13] control. But uh but uh uh they she has
[42:17] certain challenges and struggles and we
[42:20] want to pray for her that she's not
[42:22] depressed by these things. Uh he said,
[42:25] "I was communicated with brother Ben.
[42:27] Here's what I want you to hear and
[42:28] rejoice over." Oh, brother Ben is one of
[42:31] the young men there who's ministering.
[42:34] He's right now in Hanan Province and
[42:37] there are more than 110 people received
[42:41] this message in the last two weeks.
[42:43] Actually, brother Caleb and brother Ben,
[42:47] brother David went to this place last
[42:49] year while I was with brother Elvie in
[42:52] the south. And people in this place are
[42:55] brother Ben's friends. He's a young man
[42:57] that was in college and heard the
[42:58] message in college. Said they received
[43:01] this message gladly but were not
[43:03] baptized. Some of the people were
[43:05] students in the college and when they
[43:07] left they started to read the message.
[43:10] The leader is a woman preacher. After
[43:13] she read it for a few months, she phoned
[43:16] Brother Ben. See how necessary it is to
[43:18] have the message. You understand?
[43:21] &gt;&gt; If they don't have ministry, they need
[43:23] to hear that word. And that's the best
[43:25] way for for them to receive it. And
[43:28] after she'd received it for a few
[43:30] months, now notice the effect. Then she
[43:32] phoned Brother Ben while he's in Hanzhao
[43:36] for the youth camp. And so, Brother Ben
[43:39] went to this place, expounded the
[43:41] message to them, and 70 people were
[43:44] baptized. There was 110. Now, there's 70
[43:47] baptized. I'm talking about in the last
[43:48] few days. Then, Brother Ben went to the
[43:51] other two places on September the 3rd
[43:55] and uh and 16 people were baptized. He
[43:58] went to another place on September the
[44:00] 9th and there were 23 baptized. He's
[44:04] continuing this trip at this moment. I
[44:07] don't know how this is going to unfold,
[44:09] but I can see the Lord is moving
[44:11] mightily. Brother Ben said he can only
[44:14] share with the people what the Lord has
[44:16] made real to him because he's only been
[44:18] in the message a year.
[44:21] But he said that he would invite me,
[44:24] that was brother Timothy, I mean brother
[44:26] Murphy rather, uh to go with him after
[44:29] the October convention to those new
[44:32] places and to further establish them in
[44:35] the word. He closes by saying, "I saw
[44:38] the Lord is moving in a miraculous way
[44:41] so far and the spirit of unity is
[44:43] binding the brothers together and let
[44:46] the let the and let the people forget
[44:49] about their own idea and disagreement
[44:51] and looking forward to the high calling
[44:54] from the Lord." Isn't that wonderful?
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand and let's just join
[45:00] our hearts in that. Of course, we were
[45:03] just singing uh Lord I lift thy name
[45:29] God.
[45:31] Elohim.
[45:37] You're the great
[45:40] I am
[45:44] the
[45:48] lamb.
[45:50] my comfort
[45:55] can.
[46:00] Let's bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly
[46:02] Father,
[46:05] we come to you because in ourselves we
[46:09] are nothing.
[46:10] We realize that we are totally dependent
[46:15] upon the almighty
[46:18] Holy Spirit. We pray that the Holy
[46:21] Ghost,
[46:22] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God
[46:24] &gt;&gt; that has been in attendance with the
[46:27] bride of Jesus Christ, the blood washed,
[46:30] bloodwashed group, we pray, Father, that
[46:33] today you will take and anoint your
[46:36] children. We've come here, Lord, not to
[46:39] meet with one another and not to hear
[46:40] man's words, but we've come, oh God,
[46:43] that we might have the very thought of
[46:46] God, the very attribute thought of God
[46:49] to drop down into our souls, Lord. Move
[46:52] us, I pray, and may we yield to the
[46:56] moving of the Holy Spirit. I pray there
[46:58] will be a yay yay in our hearts, oh God.
[47:01] We will say, "Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Take
[47:05] me, oh God. I come surrendered. I come
[47:08] to yield myself. We've come here, Lord,
[47:10] not to put in time on a Sunday morning.
[47:13] We've come here not as a formality. We
[47:15] have come here because the message is
[47:18] urgent and we believe we need to be
[47:20] strengthened. We do not know what kind
[47:22] of battles we will face in the coming
[47:25] days. But we pray that you'll make this
[47:27] entire audience of congregation of
[47:29] people a victorious people. Father, we
[47:32] can only believe in victory. Father, our
[47:35] Lord Jesus Christ is a mighty conqueror.
[47:38] You raised and oh God took conqueror.
[47:41] You conquered death and all all that
[47:44] withtood you. And I pray, Father, you'll
[47:46] be with Brother Murphy today. Be with
[47:48] Brother Ivan as he travels. Father, be
[47:51] with the pastors in Vietnam, in Africa,
[47:54] in Europe, and all over the world. Oh
[47:56] God, and especially here in our country.
[48:00] We need you, Lord. There's wickednesses
[48:02] on every side, oh God, but you're
[48:06] greater. Light is greater than the
[48:08] darkness. Pierce the deepest darkness,
[48:12] oh God. And I pray you'll banish all
[48:14] confusion. Anyone standing here that may
[48:17] be bound in the name of Jesus Christ.
[48:20] Set them free at this moment. I pray,
[48:23] Father, by the power of the living
[48:25] Christ. And may the resurrection of
[48:27] Jesus Christ be proven here today. We
[48:30] pray father your will be done anoint
[48:33] speaker and hearers in Jesus name. Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You take your
[48:40] Bible.
[48:44] I want to turn to Philippians the third
[48:46] chapter.
[48:49] In the closing comments of brother
[48:51] Murphy,
[48:53] he said they were looking forward
[48:56] for the high calling.
[49:05] Is that better?
[49:08] Looking forward for the high calling.
[49:11] And he didn't know, of course.
[49:14] Uh, I'm speaking to you today, the Lord
[49:16] willing, on a higher calling.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:30] I want to start reading in the 10th
[49:32] verse.
[49:34] that I may know him and the power of his
[49:38] resurrection
[49:39] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[49:41] being made conformable unto his death.
[49:44] If by any means I might attain under the
[49:47] resurrection of the dead, not as though
[49:50] I had already attained either were
[49:52] already perfect, but I follow after if
[49:55] that I may apprehend that for which also
[49:58] I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
[50:01] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[50:04] apprehended, but this one thing I do,
[50:07] forgetting those things which are
[50:09] behind, and reaching forth unto those
[50:12] things which are before, I press toward
[50:16] the mark for the prize of the high
[50:18] calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us
[50:22] read that 14th verse together. It'll do
[50:25] us good. I press toward the mark for the
[50:29] prize of the high calling of God in
[50:32] Christ Jesus. Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; You'll not need to turn, but I'm going
[50:37] to read two verses out of Romans 11 and
[50:39] 28.
[50:41] As concerning the gospel, they are
[50:43] enemies for your sakes, speaking of
[50:45] Israel. But as touching the election,
[50:48] they are beloved for the father's sake.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the gifts and calling of God
[50:54] are without repentance.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; So the gifts and the calling of God are
[51:00] without repentance. I will read two
[51:02] verses out of Job while you just listen.
[51:05] If a man die, shall he live again? All
[51:09] the days of my appointed time. I will
[51:12] wait till my change come. Thou shalt
[51:16] call
[51:18] and I will answer. Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Thou wil have a desire. Thou wil have a
[51:24] desire to the work of thine hands. Thou
[51:28] shalt call.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; I will answer.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; And we will answer. Yes, Lord.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats.
[51:43] There can be no answer
[51:47] until there is a call.
[51:50] You can't answer unless there's been a
[51:52] call.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; So the call is first. It's not us
[51:56] seeking God or him seeking us.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; He calls.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; We answer.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; That's the program.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Acts 2:39 said, "For the promise is unto
[52:08] you and to your children and to all that
[52:12] are a far off, even as many as the Lord
[52:16] our God shall call."
[52:21] There's callings in life.
[52:25] Some of the students from the school,
[52:29] they're not in school this year because
[52:30] they have finished their studies and so
[52:35] they're looking forward to whatever is
[52:38] out there for them perhaps to try to
[52:41] determine what their call in life is.
[52:45] And uh there are some professions and
[52:50] uh
[52:53] professions in life that are they can be
[52:56] a job or they can be a calling. And I
[53:00] think in some of the areas of of the
[53:03] professions of the world there is it's
[53:06] more pronounced say doctors,
[53:10] nurses,
[53:11] caregivers, those that work in a
[53:13] compassionate
[53:15] uh
[53:17] those jobs that require compassion.
[53:21] Some are in those jobs and I know that
[53:23] you will agree with this. Some are in
[53:25] those positions as a job. They're
[53:28] interested in what they're earning.
[53:30] They're interested in the next increase.
[53:32] But there are others that are in it
[53:34] because they feel a calling.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; They would do it for less money.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; They they they don't watch the clock.
[53:41] They go beyond the call of duty because
[53:44] it's a calling to them. They feel it
[53:46] within them. And and then there are
[53:48] those that are I always think of
[53:50] teachers in school. Uh there are some of
[53:54] those and it's exactly the same thing.
[53:57] Some are in it because it's a job. They
[53:59] go at the starting time and they leave
[54:01] at the quitting time. But there are
[54:02] others that feel a call of God. They
[54:05] feel uh those those especially we have
[54:07] here. I know they are here because they
[54:10] feel a call. And and furthermore,
[54:12] they're not interested so much in the in
[54:14] what they're earning are because I'm
[54:16] sure all of them are earning less than
[54:18] the teachers that are out in the in the
[54:21] uh in the public schools. Uh then there
[54:25] are those that are in the ministry and a
[54:28] ministry can be a call and it can be a
[54:30] job.
[54:33] I want you to know and I'm sure that you
[54:35] do know the brothers that stand behind
[54:37] this pulpit aren't here for a job.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; They could go out in the world and do
[54:42] something different, perhaps do
[54:44] something better, but they feel a call
[54:46] on their life. Brother Bram talks about
[54:50] uh talks about uh
[54:54] preachers that weren't receiving the
[54:56] message because they were afraid on the
[54:59] basis of a meal ticket.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Are not here for a meal ticket.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; How thankful we are about that. And so
[55:08] long
[55:09] then there's a it it says concerning
[55:13] a calling that it's an inner urge or a
[55:16] strong impulse
[55:18] especially one believed to be divinely
[55:21] inspired to accept the truth of Jesus
[55:24] Christ. There's a a calling within some
[55:27] people and I don't want to get on to
[55:28] that now. I that'll be perhaps the next
[55:31] service or another service. uh it's a
[55:33] strong urge to follow a particular
[55:36] career or to do a particular a
[55:38] particular type of work an occupation a
[55:41] professor a profession or or a career as
[55:45] such then
[55:48] as far as the callings and hearing the
[55:51] call I want to just expand your thought
[55:53] for a moment while I'm introducing this
[55:57] uh that to hear the call is not just
[56:00] something that happens in life because
[56:03] the Bible says Jesus speaking, "Marvel
[56:07] not at this. For the hour is coming
[56:11] in which all that are in the graves
[56:15] shall hear the voice
[56:18] shall hear his voice long after the
[56:23] hearing, the faculty of hearing has
[56:26] gone."
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. and all the bones and the eard
[56:30] drum and the structures of the body have
[56:33] deteriorated and gone to nothing more
[56:35] than ashes.
[56:37] There's some substance there's some
[56:39] essence of the creation of God that even
[56:43] after that body is buried and gone to
[56:48] the sea or gone in gases by burning or
[56:52] gone to dust in a grave. Jesus said,
[56:56] "Marvel not at this,
[56:59] &gt;&gt; for the day is coming."
[57:01] &gt;&gt; For the day is coming, the hour is
[57:03] coming in which all that are in the
[57:06] graves shall hear his voice.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's a voice.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; That's a call.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; And you're going to answer it.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Believer, unbeliever, make believer's
[57:19] going to answer that call.
[57:21] And so we'll be talking about that a
[57:24] little further on
[57:28] going beyond the camp. I think of uh
[57:32] politicians.
[57:35] Politicians are perhaps there's some
[57:38] there with a call. I don't know. They
[57:40] feel that they want to better the world
[57:42] or better their country, better their
[57:44] state.
[57:46] And the prophet said, "Going beyond the
[57:48] camp, we need another Abraham Lincoln.
[57:51] We need another John Quincy Adams. We
[57:55] need somebody who will stand regardless
[57:57] of which way the wind's blowing.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; We need somebody to stand regardless of
[58:03] which way the votes are going
[58:05] &gt;&gt; or what the people think. We need
[58:07] preachers that'll preach from
[58:08] conviction.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; We need those that will speak because of
[58:14] truth. Right.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; And he said that will give their honest
[58:19] conviction. Today a denominational
[58:21] preacher, he said though you show him in
[58:23] the word the truth, he don't know what
[58:27] to do and he's afraid he will lose his
[58:30] meal ticket.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; So people preaching for a meal ticket,
[58:34] preaching for a position, preaching
[58:36] perhaps for the honor or their position
[58:39] in life. He said we need men and women
[58:41] today
[58:42] &gt;&gt; that's burly with the gospel. Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody that will stand and tell their
[58:48] conviction and point out what's right
[58:49] and what's wrong.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Whether the word of God's right or
[58:53] whether the denomination's right.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; In the ministry of the five-fold
[59:00] ministry, God has ordained offices
[59:04] &gt;&gt; and has placed a calling.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a calling first in the
[59:10] life of those called to those offices.
[59:13] If there isn't a calling in the life,
[59:15] there are some that are perhaps
[59:17] preaching or holding a position that
[59:20] because they're they have a certain gift
[59:22] or a certain talent or or people look up
[59:25] to them. That has nothing to do with the
[59:27] calling. It might be the person who is
[59:30] uh having difficulty putting things
[59:32] together, can't speak exactly uh right
[59:36] or whatever more. It it has nothing to
[59:38] do with human ability. It has to do with
[59:41] the call of God.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; And if the call of God is there, God's
[59:45] going to back it up.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it's irrelevant what kind of
[59:51] education they had. Well, they can't go.
[59:54] He talked about those wanting to go to
[59:56] missions and they couldn't go until they
[59:58] had reached a certain status and certain
[1:00:01] qualification, certain level of
[1:00:03] education. That has nothing to do with
[1:00:05] it. In fact, is that might be the
[1:00:06] biggest deterrent,
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; the biggest
[1:00:10] uh you know hindrance rather than the
[1:00:13] biggest help in the message the voice of
[1:00:16] the sign.
[1:00:18] But brother Brandham refers to Moses
[1:00:21] being elected and being called. Then he
[1:00:24] refers to Jeremiah said to God speaking
[1:00:27] to Jeremiah before you were formed in
[1:00:30] your mother's womb, I ordained you to be
[1:00:32] a prophet to the nation. And John the
[1:00:35] Baptist was identified in the scripture.
[1:00:38] He's the voice of one crying in the
[1:00:39] wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord.
[1:00:42] And so was all the offices of God. all
[1:00:46] the offices of God. Those you mothers,
[1:00:49] fathers, offices that God has
[1:00:51] established. And if they are, he said,
[1:00:54] if they are called of God, then they're
[1:00:56] educate, if they're educated into it,
[1:01:00] it's only cannon fodder.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; So those are powerful words.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Just uh just being educated, he said
[1:01:09] it's just cannon fodder. It can't be
[1:01:12] nothing. If it's a meal ticket, then you
[1:01:15] sell your birthright for a meal ticket.
[1:01:18] You'll compromise to go with an
[1:01:20] organization or some group.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; But if it's of God, you'll stand by that
[1:01:26] word regardless because you were born to
[1:01:30] stand by it.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Moses, no one else could take his place.
[1:01:37] No one else could do the job. He was
[1:01:39] ordained to do it. And brother, sister,
[1:01:42] so I include everyone here. If you've
[1:01:45] got eternal life, you were ordained to
[1:01:48] do a certain thing.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Maybe a good housewife. How many
[1:01:53] housewives we have here? Many. Maybe
[1:01:55] something else. But nobody can take your
[1:01:58] place.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; God has called has made you God has made
[1:02:04] you a place. And don't try to take
[1:02:07] somebody else's place.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; So that's a call of God.
[1:02:10] I believe that every believer is here
[1:02:14] under the call of God.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Every believer. And those of you that
[1:02:20] are on uh on the internet as well live
[1:02:24] streaming this service right now, I want
[1:02:26] to emphasize a higher call.
[1:02:33] That's what the message is.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; A higher call.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] their calling in life. And now here
[1:02:46] we'll include everyone. I have a few
[1:02:50] quotes I want to show here, please.
[1:02:57] I know thy works, thy labor, and thy
[1:03:00] patience. The scripture reads, "As he
[1:03:04] walks in the midst of his church, he is
[1:03:07] aware of the suffering of his people and
[1:03:10] he cares."
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he cares?
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; And it was the days of captivity in
[1:03:17] Egypt when he heard their cries.
[1:03:20] He who never changes still hears the
[1:03:24] cries of the oppressed as he walks among
[1:03:27] them.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; I tell you, this God doesn't change.
[1:03:30] This God doesn't get weary.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; This God doesn't He's not asleep.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; This God's not tired.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; And listen to me, friends. Regardless of
[1:03:40] how many times you've called, he's fully
[1:03:42] prepared to hear your whisper today.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Who never changes, still hears the cries
[1:03:50] of the oppressed as he walks amongst
[1:03:52] them. The very word labor signifies a
[1:03:55] weariness through oppression. I want you
[1:03:58] just to stop there for a moment. I've
[1:04:00] talked to enough of you people that are
[1:04:02] here. I've talked to enough people in my
[1:04:05] lifetime and this age is going to be
[1:04:08] identified and earmarked as a time of
[1:04:10] weariness
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; because of the pressures of life.
[1:04:14] There's no simple. You can go to the
[1:04:16] farmer. You can go to the You can I I
[1:04:20] have made many journeys during the time
[1:04:23] when brother Bud Southwick was still
[1:04:24] living going up to the people that are
[1:04:26] guides, hunting guides, and out in the
[1:04:29] wilderness and trappers and all. You
[1:04:32] think, "Oh, this is just wonderful. What
[1:04:34] a nice laid-back life." Don't fool
[1:04:36] yourself.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; I They were getting under so much
[1:04:39] pressure and the horses need to be fed
[1:04:41] and this has to happen. I got to fix
[1:04:43] this piece of machinery. I thought, my
[1:04:45] goodness, let me go back to the rat
[1:04:46] race.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; You think that's humorous? That's
[1:04:53] exactly the truth. I've been with
[1:04:55] farmers. I thought, let me out of here.
[1:04:57] They were just so concerned. I got to
[1:04:59] fix the barn. I got to do this. We got
[1:05:01] to do that. And the women were busy and
[1:05:04] the kids were busy and everybody was
[1:05:06] busy. It's It's nothing you're going to
[1:05:08] You can't get away from it.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; If you think it's a life of ease and
[1:05:12] everything's laidback, go out and spend
[1:05:14] some time with Brother Derek and Sister
[1:05:16] Debbie. They just have such a laid-back
[1:05:19] life back there in Mount Baker at the
[1:05:21] foot of Mount Baker. They just look up
[1:05:22] there at Mount Baker every day. It's so
[1:05:24] nice.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Some of you folks need to go out there.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; It's just so laidback. You'll be up to
[1:05:34] your arms and suds in the washing dishes
[1:05:37] or something. They'll be having another
[1:05:39] crew coming in or who knows what's
[1:05:41] what's taking place.
[1:05:44] And he said here through the weariness
[1:05:47] and through oppression.
[1:05:50] God's people and I have this underlined
[1:05:53] God's people do not only work for him in
[1:05:56] a labor of love but they suffer for him
[1:06:00] with joy. Amen.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Do remember that friends. These are not
[1:06:05] idle words. When you suffer, expect some
[1:06:08] joy.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Don't be wearied with it.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; He said they are patient in bearing the
[1:06:14] yoke.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; God's people.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; You know why they're patient in bearing
[1:06:19] the yoke? You're called to it.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; This first age suffered great
[1:06:25] persecution.
[1:06:27] It had to work hard to preach the gospel
[1:06:30] and shed forth truth. I want to just
[1:06:34] stop there, friends. We're not here to
[1:06:36] have a Sunday school picnic.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; We're here to work hard
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; to get the gospel out.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's so much that I could say and
[1:06:47] fact is I have to say it. We're not
[1:06:49] working on a school building because uh
[1:06:52] it's some great achievement or something
[1:06:54] we have to build. I'm thinking I think I
[1:06:57] can only think of the young people and
[1:06:59] the children and the little innocent
[1:07:01] lives. And when I think of that, I think
[1:07:05] every one of these minds that I can
[1:07:08] prevent from hearing the trash and
[1:07:10] hearing the vulgarity and hearing the
[1:07:13] cursing and hearing the evil things and
[1:07:16] and prevent their eyes from seeing the
[1:07:18] sights and their ears from hearing those
[1:07:20] words. I feel it's an honor. Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; I feel it's actually worth our labor.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; I think it's worth our all of our
[1:07:28] giving. When I think of every believer
[1:07:31] and I get a book and can send that,
[1:07:34] whether it be the hub or whether it be a
[1:07:36] disc or whether it be a piece of paper,
[1:07:38] I don't care. But as long as we can get
[1:07:41] those words in front of someone else's
[1:07:43] eyes and prevent that soul from all the
[1:07:47] wounds and the trouble and the turmoil
[1:07:50] and get a flow of strength coming into
[1:07:52] them, getting a divine uh virtue coming
[1:07:56] into them. To me, that's a the most
[1:07:59] worthy that's a higher calling.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Any soul that we can reach for the
[1:08:07] gospel.
[1:08:09] He said their high calling in life,
[1:08:13] their high calling in life was to serve
[1:08:16] God.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; And when their hopes in this life were
[1:08:20] blighted, they were patient and
[1:08:23] committed all to him who had promised a
[1:08:26] lasting recompense in heaven for what
[1:08:29] they had given up for him on earth.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] Are you reading the same
[1:08:41] words? You weren't reading all the same
[1:08:43] words. I got caught up here.
[1:08:50] God's people
[1:08:53] do not only work for him in labor of
[1:08:56] love, but they suffer with him. They
[1:08:59] suffer for him with joy.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; They are patient in bearing the yoke.
[1:09:05] The first age suffered great
[1:09:07] persecution.
[1:09:09] It had to work hard to preach the gospel
[1:09:11] and shed forth truth. Their high
[1:09:14] calling,
[1:09:16] I hope you can just take and make that
[1:09:18] your personal message today. Their high
[1:09:22] calling. Put your name in there. My high
[1:09:26] calling
[1:09:28] w is to serve God.
[1:09:31] And when their hopes in life were
[1:09:33] blighted, and I will say that they will
[1:09:36] be blighted, they will be uh wearied,
[1:09:41] they were patient and committed all to
[1:09:44] him who had promised a lasting
[1:09:46] recompense in heaven
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; for what they had given up for him on
[1:09:51] earth. Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:09:56] in the message believing God
[1:09:59] uh brother Brandham said God said he's
[1:10:02] speaking to Abraham come out Abraham and
[1:10:06] go into a land and he was looking for a
[1:10:09] city whose builder and maker was God.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; And now he makes this phrase. Now, if
[1:10:15] that was what we would refer to in the
[1:10:18] natural life would be, I'd say instinct.
[1:10:23] That Abraham, he perhaps had an
[1:10:26] instinct. He said, "You'd naturally call
[1:10:29] it that instinct." He said, "We call it
[1:10:33] leadings of the Holy Ghost."
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; So now I put those two together. Say
[1:10:39] there's a high calling, a higher
[1:10:41] calling. And I want to announce to this
[1:10:44] congregation, whether you are aware of
[1:10:46] it at this moment or not, there's an
[1:10:48] instinct,
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; there's a leadings of the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; There's an instinct within the believer
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; to to answer to that call.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; We are being called, not have been
[1:11:03] called, but we are being called to a
[1:11:06] higher calling. Amen.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to refer to a number of number
[1:11:11] of areas in life where there's a higher
[1:11:14] calling. This message encompasses every
[1:11:19] area of life that I have ever
[1:11:20] encountered as far as myself. It's
[1:11:23] touched every part of my life. It
[1:11:25] touches our home.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; It touches how we live. It touches how
[1:11:29] we act, how we speak, how we worship,
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; how we dress, how we conduct ourselves,
[1:11:35] our demeanor. and we have a touch with
[1:11:37] we we are touched within ourselves when
[1:11:39] we cross that border and we say that's
[1:11:42] not exactly what Christ would do but
[1:11:44] there's a faithful Holy Spirit that's
[1:11:47] speaking to the individual and telling
[1:11:50] us that we've crossed the border we we
[1:11:52] say that Lord forgive me I'm sorry for
[1:11:55] that wash me cleanse me don't you
[1:11:58] experience that
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; do you know why it's not just a
[1:12:01] conscience but it's an instinct it's a
[1:12:04] spiritual ual instinct because if it's
[1:12:07] just conscience, you find some that can
[1:12:09] do it and they don't have any conscience
[1:12:11] about it because that's just natural
[1:12:14] instinct. That's just a natural
[1:12:16] instinct. But there's something that's
[1:12:18] much deeper than that and it's a
[1:12:20] spiritual it's called the leadings of
[1:12:23] the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; The believer has a has the leadings. a
[1:12:28] person that's been called by God's
[1:12:30] voice. God sends his spirit to give them
[1:12:34] leadings of the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; God called him out from among his
[1:12:42] people, out of a land, his own homeland,
[1:12:46] from his people.
[1:12:49] Moses,
[1:12:51] now I'm going to make some statements of
[1:12:54] different ones. I want to go down
[1:12:55] through some individuals and then into
[1:12:59] certain areas of our lives. Moses
[1:13:04] was a higher calling than Egypt.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, the people, they
[1:13:10] were living in Egypt. They had their
[1:13:12] families in Egypt. They had children in
[1:13:14] Egypt. They had the they had life to
[1:13:17] support in Egypt. But when Moses came
[1:13:20] around, he was a higher calling. And the
[1:13:24] and the prophet said, "God called Israel
[1:13:29] out of Egypt."
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; All these people came forth. Every one
[1:13:33] of them was delivered, crossed over the
[1:13:35] Red Sea into the wilderness, and when
[1:13:38] they got ready, listened. They listened
[1:13:40] to Moses' message and started to march.
[1:13:43] Amen. speaking of justification. And
[1:13:46] they came to the Red Sea. He said the
[1:13:48] blood and they went through the Red Sea
[1:13:51] and behind them all the task masters was
[1:13:54] laying dead. This is just about 3 days
[1:13:57] from the promised land right before
[1:13:59] them, less than 40 miles. I say that's a
[1:14:02] higher calling
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; than making mud in Egypt.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Where you are today is a higher calling
[1:14:08] than where where you folks were not very
[1:14:10] long ago. Some of you a few months ago,
[1:14:13] maybe others months or years ago or or a
[1:14:16] lifetime ago. But where you are today, I
[1:14:20] say in the authority of God's word, you
[1:14:23] have you have abided by. You have heard
[1:14:26] a higher calling.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; There has been something within you, an
[1:14:30] instinct, something you cannot explain.
[1:14:33] You don't even know why you said yes
[1:14:36] when you did.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; But there was something within you that
[1:14:39] was demanding it. There was something
[1:14:41] within you that was saying, "This is
[1:14:43] true."
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; There was something within you that was
[1:14:46] willing to say, "I'm giving myself to
[1:14:49] this."
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand that. You didn't
[1:14:51] understand what the cost would be. You
[1:14:54] didn't even understand. Perhaps some of
[1:14:55] you that have been in the way a long
[1:14:57] time, you say, "If I'd known this way
[1:14:59] back then, I wonder if I would have said
[1:15:01] yes." Yes, you would have.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; God knew. All right. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; In three kinds of believers, he said, if
[1:15:10] you would have lived in the days of
[1:15:11] Moses,
[1:15:14] you would have believed Moses message
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; after it had been proven after it had
[1:15:20] been proven and have vindicated by God.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; But would you want uh but would you have
[1:15:26] went with Kora or Dayan and them and
[1:15:30] said, "You're not the holy one. You're
[1:15:32] not the only holy one. There's other
[1:15:34] people that can do these things. H and
[1:15:38] uh and and you do it, too. But he said,
[1:15:41] you'd have to be the one uh that you are
[1:15:44] tonight. You'd have to make the choice.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Would you be going with Moses or would
[1:15:48] you be going with Kora and Dayan?
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; But you you made the choice because of
[1:15:55] the call in the message stand still. And
[1:15:58] this was here in Canada. This was
[1:16:00] preached. Not long after that, he said
[1:16:02] some 40 years the people would not
[1:16:05] receive Caleb and Joshua because under
[1:16:08] Moses' message
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; came other ones that God was raising up.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; And there was a Caleb and a Joshua. And
[1:16:15] they said the right thing.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; They said, "Stand still.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; See the glory of God."
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "They're just bread for us."
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; While others were saying, "We're like
[1:16:26] grasshoppers."
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; These said, "We can do it. We can go in.
[1:16:29] let's go in and take the land. Why
[1:16:31] hesitate?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; And they had to wait because the others
[1:16:35] uh didn't believe. And he said, we find
[1:16:37] Joshua representing grace
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; or some propitiation. So I'm saying that
[1:16:44] Moses was a higher calling
[1:16:47] than Egypt.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Now I'm saying Joshua was a higher
[1:16:52] calling than the wilderness.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you agree with that? But
[1:16:57] Joshua's commission came after Moses had
[1:17:02] died. Moses, my servant, is dead. So we
[1:17:05] said, we find Joshua representing grace
[1:17:07] or some propitiation that it could not
[1:17:11] exist in the same time the law was in
[1:17:14] existence.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; You can't have grace and law at the same
[1:17:17] time.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; I want to be under grace.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; I want to be under grace.
[1:17:26] God's the initiator and the inventor of
[1:17:29] grace.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither does any message that
[1:17:35] forwards the people on ever coincide
[1:17:39] with the past message.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; It will not do it."
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; There he says that's where you have
[1:17:46] trouble today. And he says Joshua could
[1:17:50] not at all become into his ministry
[1:17:53] until after Moses was gone.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham's ministry
[1:17:59] encompassed which I will come to in a
[1:18:02] few moments. It encompassed Moses
[1:18:04] ministry.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; It was a delivering ministry. Brother
[1:18:07] Brandham's ministry encompassed Joshua's
[1:18:10] ministry.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[1:18:14] Brother Brandham's ministry encompassed
[1:18:16] the ministry of Jesus.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; They were just identical
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; in every pattern, every way. Are you
[1:18:23] with me, friend?
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to see it was a higher
[1:18:28] calling. Always a higher calling. The
[1:18:30] people could not continue under Moses'
[1:18:33] ministry of the law and get into the
[1:18:36] promised land. They needed some grace to
[1:18:38] take them into the promised land.
[1:18:42] And Jesus, I will say that Jesus,
[1:18:44] because I want to hurry along here,
[1:18:46] Jesus was the embodiment of the higher
[1:18:49] calling.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; There was every every characteristic of
[1:18:54] the life of Jesus. No wonder he was the
[1:18:57] perfect one. He was the masterpiece. He
[1:19:00] was the embodiment. He was the Godhead
[1:19:03] uh uh fully Godhead bodily. He He was He
[1:19:08] was everything that we long to be.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; It says in it it says of Jesus that that
[1:19:19] uh he was he was the masterpiece the
[1:19:22] prophet calls him. But then after Jesus
[1:19:25] was lived his life out,
[1:19:29] you'd think, well surely
[1:19:33] uh that was the highest. We can't go any
[1:19:36] higher. That's the that's the headstone.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; But the thing was it hadn't been
[1:19:40] conveyed to all the people.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; So after Jesus was here, he showed
[1:19:46] himself again to the Apostle Paul
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; on the road to Damascus. Who art thou
[1:19:52] Lord? I'm Jesus.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Whom thou persecutest?
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul comes on the scene. And
[1:20:00] I would like to say that Apostle Paul
[1:20:04] not a higher calling than Christ but
[1:20:06] higher in that he was bringing to the
[1:20:09] people what Jesus Christ was
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; the fullness of Christ.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; So Paul was a higher calling by
[1:20:17] introducing grace over law
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; and bringing the gospel also to the
[1:20:23] Gentiles,
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; grace over works. And so Paul had to say
[1:20:27] these things. For by grace
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; are you saved?
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Are you saved?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; How many are saved?
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; You were saved by grace.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; By grace are you saved.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for that.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Through faith
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; and that not of yourself.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; In fact, as I will add, not adding to
[1:20:49] the scripture, but often in spite of
[1:20:52] yourself.
[1:20:54] Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; By grace are you saved through faith and
[1:21:00] not of yourselves.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; It is the gift of God.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; A higher calling
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; than works.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And those who still attempt to achieve
[1:21:15] something or gain something by from God
[1:21:19] through works, you can't work it.
[1:21:22] That's why people say, "Well, as soon as
[1:21:24] I get victory over this, then I'll serve
[1:21:26] God." Forget it.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; It comes by grace.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Are you saved through faith? You must
[1:21:34] believe it
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; and then you'll receive it.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:41] This is a little more difficult but the
[1:21:44] scripture that Paul spoke and if by
[1:21:47] grace then it is no more of works.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Otherwise grace is no more grace.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; But if it is of works then it is no more
[1:21:59] of grace.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Otherwise work is no more work.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; So if it's of works it's not of grace.
[1:22:06] If it's grace it's not of works. That's
[1:22:08] really the summary of that verse. If
[1:22:12] it's of grace, it's not of works.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; You can't mingle the two. The two won't
[1:22:17] live together.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; In Timothy, 2 Timothy 1:9, who hath
[1:22:24] saved us and called us
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; with a holy calling.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not according to our works, but
[1:22:34] according to his own purpose and grace,
[1:22:38] which is given us in Christ Jesus before
[1:22:41] the world began.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God had this program in his
[1:22:46] mind. Long before you arrived, before
[1:22:49] your forefathers arrived, before the
[1:22:52] foundation of the world, God had a plan
[1:22:55] that he was going to give his children.
[1:22:57] He was going to receive them by grace.
[1:22:59] He was going to call them and instill in
[1:23:02] them an instinct.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; A six sense.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Now I just want to come quickly to the
[1:23:12] messengers.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; You can take this off please.
[1:23:19] The invisible union. in the invisible
[1:23:21] union.
[1:23:24] Brother Brandham says, "So has it been
[1:23:27] in God in his church."
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Justification under Luther.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; And that's pulling the bride out. Now
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; he's creating his bride.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Justification under Luther. I will say
[1:23:43] Luther was a higher calling than the
[1:23:46] dark ages.
[1:23:47] And I think that you wouldn't have to
[1:23:49] have much of a revelation to agree with
[1:23:51] that. It was a higher calling
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; than the dark ages.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; He says, "So it has been God and his
[1:23:58] church justification under Luther,
[1:24:03] justification, sanctification under
[1:24:06] Wesley."
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; And they they say, now I'm just
[1:24:09] repeating things that you know well, but
[1:24:11] I want to put them in a certain
[1:24:13] structure. So I say Wesley was a higher
[1:24:16] calling when Wesley came and began to
[1:24:18] speak to the people who had believed in
[1:24:22] the just shall live by faith.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; But he's speaking of this and it's
[1:24:26] called commonly called the second work
[1:24:29] of grace
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; because Wesley called them to holiness.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; He said the evolution of the spirit
[1:24:37] being given more and more.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if he says it's more and more
[1:24:43] it's it's a higher calling.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; It's a better it's a more needful thing
[1:24:49] because the body is building coming to
[1:24:52] the head which is Christ the body of
[1:24:55] Christ. So Luther was a higher calling
[1:24:58] than the previous age and Wesley he said
[1:25:01] is the se second work of grace. Look
[1:25:04] what he done. He said he introduced
[1:25:06] holiness to the church.
[1:25:09] And so now I think I have just laid a
[1:25:11] bit of a foundation.
[1:25:13] So I want to
[1:25:16] suggest to you and emphasize to you the
[1:25:20] high calling of God onto our message.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; The high calling of God. I press towards
[1:25:33] the mark for the prize of the high
[1:25:38] calling. Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; of God
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. Christ Jesus is none
[1:25:44] other than the word. It's either
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; a Bible that's mysterious or a book
[1:25:51] that's been revealed.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And I will say revelation a little ahead
[1:25:56] of myself right now, but revelation is
[1:25:58] higher than intellectual concept.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; I press toward the mark.
[1:26:08] So of the high calling of God
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. And the scripture says,
[1:26:14] "Surely
[1:26:16] the Lord God
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; will do nothing."
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; But he revealth his secret
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; to his servants, the prophets.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amos 3:7.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Surely the Lord God, I press toward the
[1:26:32] mark of the calling of God. Amen.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; And the scripture saying, "But God, this
[1:26:37] God will do nothing."
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Till he reveals his secret to his
[1:26:43] servants, the prophets.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; So now we've got it narrowed down what
[1:26:48] the channel is.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And it says in the Hebrew, and the
[1:26:52] Hebrew twists it a little bit
[1:26:54] differently. This is word for word out
[1:26:57] of the Hebrew scriptures. For not will
[1:27:01] do the Lord Jehovah a thing.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; For not will do the Lord Jehovah a thing
[1:27:09] unless he reveals his secret counsel to
[1:27:12] his servants, the prophets.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; So whether it's in the Hebrew, whether
[1:27:16] it's in the English, it's simply very
[1:27:18] it's it's within everybody's grasp. God
[1:27:21] won't do anything
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; until he reveals it to his servants, the
[1:27:27] prophets. To me, that must be the prize
[1:27:31] of the high calling of God in Christ
[1:27:34] Jesus.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; It'll be in the word. It will be in
[1:27:37] Christ Jesus. But he will only reveal
[1:27:40] Christ Jesus. He will only reveal these
[1:27:43] attributes. He'll only reveal this
[1:27:46] marvelous embodiment
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; of perfection
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; which much of it is secret. Much of it
[1:27:52] is beyond our understanding. The people
[1:27:55] didn't understand him. That's why they
[1:27:56] crucified him. He was a mystery to the
[1:27:59] people.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; He's still a mystery to the people. And
[1:28:03] you can't learn him.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; He's revealed.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; That's why revelation is higher than
[1:28:10] learning. Revelation is higher than some
[1:28:12] teaching.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Are you in agreement with me?
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; It's a higher calling.
[1:28:22] He'll do nothing.
[1:28:27] There's no higher.
[1:28:32] Take it back, please.
[1:28:44] There's no higher order to reveal the
[1:28:48] word
[1:28:49] than prophets.
[1:29:13] Just a moment here.
[1:29:26] Okay. Notice the very day. Is this what
[1:29:29] we have up here?
[1:29:31] Here
[1:29:36] we are.
[1:29:38] Notice the very day when his messenger
[1:29:43] not when he starts on on on not when he
[1:29:47] starts on the but when he when he begins
[1:29:50] to declare his message.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; The first pull healing. The second poll
[1:29:57] prophesying. The third pull opening of
[1:29:59] the word. Let me just stop there a
[1:30:01] moment. The second pull is a higher
[1:30:03] calling than the first.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And the first pull is a higher calling
[1:30:08] than whatever you were in before.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; There had to be a first pull.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; And it was a great healing ministry.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And I'll put it in the natural. A great
[1:30:21] healing. Healing is higher calling than
[1:30:24] sickness.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Healing is a higher calling. If you're
[1:30:29] if you're here sick and afflicted today,
[1:30:32] there's a higher calling for you. And
[1:30:34] it's under this word.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is calling you to a
[1:30:40] higher perhaps it's just physical, but
[1:30:43] it's it's still part of it.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; If you're here and you're sick and
[1:30:46] you're afflicted, I want to bring you to
[1:30:48] the reality. There's a higher calling
[1:30:51] going out even at this moment.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; A higher calling for you.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Which is to be well.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; It may not happen in instant, but it
[1:31:02] could.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; I just feel like staying on that. God's
[1:31:07] greater than that disease.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; God's greater than that affliction.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; We'll deal with the physical for a
[1:31:16] moment. The first pull. God's greater
[1:31:19] Hallelujah. I don't know what it may be
[1:31:21] that may be afflicting a person.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Milo. God's
[1:31:25] greater than that has been afflicting
[1:31:27] you.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; We've been praying for you. Are there
[1:31:30] others here who needs healing?
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; God's greater. Your hand is up. Your
[1:31:40] heart is there. God's greater than that.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; He's a mighty healer. He's the mighty
[1:31:48] conqueror. He raised for our
[1:31:50] justification.
[1:31:51] He He He was crucified. And by his
[1:31:55] stripes, you are healed.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; That's God's word.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And this Bible has to be effective.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit is here to make it
[1:32:07] effective.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; We're not here to have church. We're
[1:32:10] here to see the manifestation of God in
[1:32:13] his body, in his people, in his church.
[1:32:17] You on the internet, you're sick and
[1:32:19] afflicted. This Bible says, "I am the
[1:32:22] Lord that health thee. Rise in the name
[1:32:25] of Jesus Christ."
[1:32:27] We're called under this message. People
[1:32:30] say, "Oh, well, the first the first pull
[1:32:32] that was just back there. That was just,
[1:32:34] you know, that don't don't minimize
[1:32:36] that. There's multitudes of people in
[1:32:38] the third poll that need the first one.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we want to have a church
[1:32:44] that has all three.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; We don't want We don't want to say, "Oh,
[1:32:51] I'm up here in the third pole, but you
[1:32:53] haven't even got the first one,
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; and Satan's beating you all up."
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; I said, "Satan has no right.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; He has no right to this body, this
[1:33:04] vessel of God.
[1:33:06] Do you agree with that?
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; I want to thrust him out. I want to see
[1:33:12] him defeated. Brother Nathan, the name
[1:33:15] of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; We're not preaching just because uh we
[1:33:19] want to pass air out of our mouth and
[1:33:20] say words. Not a bit. We're preaching
[1:33:23] because this is the truth
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; of God's word.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; And then he receives glory.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Let the Lord Jesus be glorified.
[1:33:37] Glory to God. Lord,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; may we hear testimony
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; of the marvelous healing power of God.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Sister Aaness, mother still struggling
[1:33:49] with those cancer cells. And we speak in
[1:33:52] the name of Jesus Christ. May those
[1:33:55] cancer cells die.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; We don't care whether it's in this
[1:33:58] building or in China.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Let those cancer cells die.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:05] We've been praying for Sister Karen's
[1:34:07] brother, Lyall Thicken, in the name of
[1:34:10] Jesus. May God be glorified. May faith
[1:34:14] come to his heart. Hallelujah. Under
[1:34:17] this message, the first pull came with
[1:34:20] healing in his wings.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Let's never forget that.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Let's not let Satan beat you up.
[1:34:30] You might be feeling just wonderful
[1:34:32] today, but you might be in some
[1:34:34] affliction tomorrow.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; And in this age, such a tormenting age,
[1:34:40] the emotional
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; age of men and women's minds under such
[1:34:46] pressure. They're right on the edge of
[1:34:48] collapse. And they're right on the edge
[1:34:50] of coming apart and all these things.
[1:34:53] Let this not be a part of the body of
[1:34:55] Jesus Christ.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; There's more strength There's more
[1:34:59] healing.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; There's more power.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; There's more deliverance. Hallelujah.
[1:35:05] God can strengthen the human mind and
[1:35:08] that whole emotional realm. You don't
[1:35:10] have to feel on the edge.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; I'd sooner have you go out of this place
[1:35:14] today feeling and knowing in your inner
[1:35:17] man, in your soul. I'm the conqueror
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; through Jesus Christ, my Lord.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; It's a higher calling.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; And the second pull, revealing the
[1:35:32] secret of the heart.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; You weren't expecting this perhaps when
[1:35:35] I started out. You might not have
[1:35:37] thought it was going to come so direct.
[1:35:39] But the same Holy Spirit, for it's the
[1:35:42] word of God that's quick and powerful
[1:35:44] and sharper than any two-edged sword,
[1:35:46] piercing even to the the dividing of
[1:35:52] soul and spirit.
[1:35:54] The same God who heals a body knows what
[1:35:57] your soul and your spirit needs.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your conscience, you got a
[1:36:02] guilty conscience. May God cleanse that
[1:36:05] conscience. By the power of the Holy
[1:36:07] Ghost, your memory, you got bad
[1:36:10] memories. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:36:13] we speak to those memories. The Holy
[1:36:16] Ghost is here to purge out that channel.
[1:36:22] Hallelujah.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Let it flow.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Let it come. Say yes now. Yes, God.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Come, oh God. Let the Holy Spirit
[1:36:34] cleanse that channel,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; that memories,
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; let it be gone.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:42] That imagination,
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; that conscience,
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; that affection, some ill affection in
[1:36:49] the name of Jesus,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; may Satan be smitten
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; in that reasoning. Oh, we can reason all
[1:36:57] kind. Your reasoning won't get you any
[1:36:59] place.
[1:37:03] There's multitudes of atheists and
[1:37:05] agnostics
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; and doubters that are laying in the
[1:37:09] graves today
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; with the earthworms of the worms have
[1:37:13] destroyed their body. Where did their
[1:37:15] reasoning get them? Nowhere.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Revelation
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; is higher
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; than reasoning.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; This message came.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; It can only be It cannot be imagined. It
[1:37:29] cannot be reasoned.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; It can't be learned.
[1:37:33] If you can only learn it, someone can
[1:37:36] unlearn it for you.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; It's something in fact is when God sends
[1:37:42] something he says this can only be
[1:37:44] revealed. You can only get this by
[1:37:46] revelation.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Then he's not going to hold revelation
[1:37:50] back from you.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; He's going to give you the revelation.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; So I am saying revelation is part and
[1:37:57] parcel of the call.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; I called you. I'll reveal it to you.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Just rejoice in that.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Say, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; You're going to reveal it to me.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; If it's not today, maybe tomorrow, but
[1:38:14] you're going to reveal it.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; I don't understand it, but you're going
[1:38:17] to cause me to understand it."
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; The third pull,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; the opening of the word, the mysteries
[1:38:29] revealed. I want to get this. There's no
[1:38:33] more higher order
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; to reveal the word than prophets.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I will do nothing.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Your Bible school will never discover
[1:38:45] it. Your church and all the men with
[1:38:48] their robes and their collars and
[1:38:50] whatever more this suit or anybody's
[1:38:52] suit, it's not going to reveal it to
[1:38:54] them.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; The highest order. There's no higher
[1:38:59] order.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're under the highest
[1:39:03] order?
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about a government.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about politics.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; We're not talking even about some
[1:39:14] religious order.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; You're under a prophet order.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; And there is no higher order
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; than a prophet.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And I'm not talking about
[1:39:28] some prophet that just has multitudes of
[1:39:30] people. I'm talking about a proven,
[1:39:33] vindicated prophet
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; that would stand on the platform before
[1:39:38] thousands of people and say if he
[1:39:40] doesn't come now and confirm what I've
[1:39:43] spoken the truth, I am a false prophet.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of prophet. There's no
[1:39:49] higher order than thus saith the Lord.
[1:39:58] Hallelujah.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Until this last age,
[1:40:13] the people under their messenger,
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; will be
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; the final voice
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; to the final age.
[1:40:24] Hallelujah.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Then God sent Wesley and he was a voice
[1:40:34] with the word in his day.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; The people who looked uh who took his
[1:40:39] revelation from God became the living
[1:40:41] epistles read and known of all men
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; for their generation. We weren't back
[1:40:47] there. But when the Methodists failed,
[1:40:49] God raised up others. And so it has gone
[1:40:53] on through the years until
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; say the word until.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; In the last day,
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; there is again another people.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; There's again another people
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; in the land
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; who under their messenger
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; will be the final voice to the final
[1:41:15] age.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; We're not here to be silent.
[1:41:20] Your life speaks.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; How we live and conduct ourselves
[1:41:24] speaks.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; You don't mind if I say some anything.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Anything.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Clothing. Being clothed
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; in a godly manner
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; is a higher calling than nakedness.
[1:41:48] Amen.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Our little girls are going to school in
[1:41:52] short shorts.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Clothing
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; is a high order.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; A prophet of God has said
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; they cause men to lust after them. They
[1:42:05] will stand before God as a prostitute.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; And in the prayer,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; lead us not into temptation. That's
[1:42:16] exactly what he's trying to do.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, God, we don't preach
[1:42:23] a clothesline gospel." Jesus did.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Women were dressed like women.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Men dressed like men.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; You'd be surprised. We have people that
[1:42:34] are not even converted drive by here,
[1:42:37] come into this church, and say, "I see
[1:42:38] your children the way they're dressed."
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it spoke a message to them.
[1:42:45] Hallelujah.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; One of those men was Brother Phil
[1:42:49] Girtson's dad
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; came here and says, "What kind of
[1:42:52] church?" Timothy's dad.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; You boys stand up.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And brother Phil Girtson's now is one of
[1:43:00] the senior teachers
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; in this school.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; That's how your father came to be uh
[1:43:07] amazed. How are these children dressed?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Why did he see that? because he knew it
[1:43:13] was a higher calling.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Than the nakedness that's in the land.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; You young men,
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; you young ladies, you hear the words
[1:43:23] that come out of the mouths of people.
[1:43:25] How thankful I am to God. It's not
[1:43:28] something some constraint that you put
[1:43:30] on it. It's a life that's in you
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; and you don't have any desire for that.
[1:43:35] Why? Because you come under a message
[1:43:37] that's a higher calling.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You heard another voice
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; when it spoke to you and said, "Go to
[1:43:45] the water
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:43:49] Jesus Christ."
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; 110 in one place in the last two weeks
[1:43:53] and 70 in another place and 16 in
[1:43:56] another place. I thank God.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; I thank God that even from this
[1:44:02] assembly, we've been able to send out
[1:44:04] men with the gospel under their
[1:44:06] messenger
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; and people have heard the voice.
[1:44:11] Glory to God.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Oh, that's just a few
[1:44:14] people. One and three, one, one and a
[1:44:16] quarter billion people in China." You
[1:44:18] ought to know it. I just tell you, and
[1:44:21] this is on the internet. The authorities
[1:44:23] know about us.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; And they had a concern,
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; naturally. They have a concern those
[1:44:30] because they're afraid it'll go like a
[1:44:32] prairie fire.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; And it will.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; But it only goes to the elect. Yes.
[1:44:38] Amen.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; How can you tell us as believers?
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; How can Satan even put it in our minds?
[1:44:44] Well, just relax and be easy about it
[1:44:47] when we're out trying to get the last
[1:44:48] ones in.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; They might be in Seattle. They might be
[1:44:52] in London. They might be in Tacoma. They
[1:44:54] might be in Beijing. We don't care where
[1:44:57] they are.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; We got a commission to go and find them.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; We say, "God bless brother Ivan. Maybe
[1:45:04] he'll find it. God bless brother Murphy.
[1:45:07] Maybe he'll find it. Maybe brother
[1:45:09] Timothy, maybe brother Dioa. I don't
[1:45:11] care who finds it. And if we can give
[1:45:13] them some help,
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; if we can give them prayer,
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; if we can give them some resource or
[1:45:19] some encouragement,
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; God is guiding your footsteps and guide
[1:45:24] you to connect with somebody that needs
[1:45:26] you at that time.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; You that are here and those of you that
[1:45:31] felt led of God to move in, we needed
[1:45:34] you. Hallelujah.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; God needed you.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; I needed you. The people needed you.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Kim, we needed you.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Ernie, we need you.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; We need men. Congregation. We need you.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; You may be sitting there never even
[1:45:49] saying uh uh you know demonstrative or
[1:45:52] saying an amen or up off your seat.
[1:45:54] That's fine. We need that strength.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; We need that resource.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; We need that brotherhood.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; You sisters, we need that godly Sisters,
[1:46:04] we need you.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God leads you here for a
[1:46:08] purpose.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Jean, Sister Sephora felt led of
[1:46:13] God bring their family here under a lot
[1:46:15] of pressure, a lot of strain, but we
[1:46:18] needed you. I say that not because
[1:46:20] there's anything in my mind
[1:46:22] specifically. You may think we've done a
[1:46:24] lot for you, but God needed you. The
[1:46:27] body of Christ needed you. you that are
[1:46:29] out there on uh on the internet and you
[1:46:32] write letters and send sometime before I
[1:46:34] leave this church I have one or two
[1:46:36] emails already. Oh, how the message
[1:46:38] spoke to me. I know the other brothers
[1:46:41] have it as well. How the word spoke to
[1:46:43] me. I needed it. Not only that, we need
[1:46:46] them.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; We need your prayer. We need your We
[1:46:50] need your giving. We need your resource.
[1:46:52] Yes, sir.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Not giving financially, but giving of
[1:46:54] yourself. You brothers that have been
[1:46:57] giving of your time, you young men, you
[1:47:00] sisters out there, I tell you what, we
[1:47:02] take we take unconverted men there are
[1:47:05] contractors and they see what has
[1:47:07] happened and they're absolutely
[1:47:09] dumbfounded.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; They're brought to speechlessness.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; They can't believe that the people were
[1:47:16] able to construct that place.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Hey, and we have contractors and they
[1:47:22] said we couldn't do it in 12 months. We
[1:47:25] couldn't do in 12 months what you've
[1:47:27] done in 11.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because as it was in the
[1:47:34] scripture, God put a spirit, a willing
[1:47:36] spirit upon the people and they gave
[1:47:38] themselves.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, this is just a
[1:47:42] building." Exactly. But you know what
[1:47:44] they're going to hear in that building?
[1:47:46] They're going to hear the name of Jesus.
[1:47:47] Amen.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; They're going to see things that are and
[1:47:52] and and we're we're preventing them.
[1:47:54] We're closing off their vision from the
[1:47:57] world and the things of the world.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, they'll come in contact with it,
[1:48:01] but we want them to be strong. Why are
[1:48:03] you here? So that the ministry can
[1:48:05] preach the word and you can absorb that
[1:48:08] word. You can yield to the spirit of the
[1:48:11] word.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; I can only I can only say the words. The
[1:48:14] Holy Ghost has to come in behind it
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; and and and and and
[1:48:19] anchor it in your heart.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Final voice to the final age.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; You take that off now.
[1:48:32] As Moses was given two signs,
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; prophet said, as Moses was given two
[1:48:37] signs to vindicate his ministry, so will
[1:48:39] you be given two signs
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; under under their messenger. Amen.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Will be the final voice.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Our messenger was given the two signs as
[1:48:48] Moses was given.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; You can say that people talk the Mormons
[1:48:52] talk about Joseph Smith and the Muhammad
[1:48:54] uh Islam has Muhammad as as their
[1:48:57] prophet waiting for him to come back. Uh
[1:49:00] there isn't any of those men that said
[1:49:02] thus sayith the Lord.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; This is according to the scripture. None
[1:49:08] of them came and said, "Be baptized in
[1:49:10] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; A true prophet came.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; That was vindicated
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; with two signs.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; And you'll be given two signs. And by
[1:49:23] these two signs, And by these two signs,
[1:49:27] listen to this friends.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; And by these two signs that people will
[1:49:33] believe.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "And I believe it's the
[1:49:37] same angel of the covenant."
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; When he told me, he said, "As Moses was
[1:49:43] given two signs to vindicate his
[1:49:45] ministry, so you'll be given two signs."
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; And by these signs,
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; the people will believe. And there it
[1:49:53] is.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; I believe it's the same angel of the
[1:49:56] covenant.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Says it twice.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; I stand as Joshua.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We I said Joshua had a higher was
[1:50:05] a higher order or a higher calling.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; God called the people under Joshua to a
[1:50:12] higher calling.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And don't forget friends, when people
[1:50:16] failed to hear or put sufficient
[1:50:20] emphasis on what their messenger was
[1:50:23] saying, they were not they did not
[1:50:25] benefit. Amen.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; They did not receive the benefits that
[1:50:30] God had for them.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; And he and the and the prophet said, "Oh
[1:50:35] God, I pray now."
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; I stand as Joshua in the valley
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; and say, "The land is good."
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; We're under that messenger.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; The land is good. The land is your life
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; in the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your messenger said your life in
[1:50:57] the Holy Ghost is good.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that? It's good.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Don't live some second rate life.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Call the devil a liar.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Your life in the Holy Ghost is good.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you friends, I'm on the war
[1:51:22] path. I'm against the enemy
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; that tries to afflict you
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; when you've left here. Tries to take
[1:51:29] away from your from your victory and
[1:51:32] your joy and your peace.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray now I stand as Joshua in
[1:51:51] the valley.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The land is good.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; We're going over after it.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, here we come in Jesus name.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; I cast out the spirit of unbelief.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; And ask that there won't be a feeble one
[1:52:07] left
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; for God's glory.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; That prayer wasn't just then. That
[1:52:12] prayer is just as effective today
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; because we are agreeing with it.
[1:52:22] Amen.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; He tried to bring us to misery if he
[1:52:26] can.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Not only not only
[1:52:30] adults,
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; young people,
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; listen to me, friend. Just on the news a
[1:52:37] few days ago, the grand chief of one of
[1:52:41] the native tribes of Canada was on
[1:52:44] national radio
[1:52:47] pleading for some help.
[1:52:49] because they had about three suicides in
[1:52:52] a few days and they were 15 years old
[1:52:57] because it's hopeless.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; They don't see any I'm talking to you
[1:53:00] young people. It seems hopeless. There
[1:53:03] doesn't seem to be a future for them.
[1:53:05] Oh, how they need this gospel.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; How they need to hear what you're
[1:53:10] hearing.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; The devil speaks. He He doesn't, you
[1:53:17] know, just say, "Well, I'll only start
[1:53:18] speaking to them after they're 10 years
[1:53:20] old." They speak to you when you're five
[1:53:22] and when you're eight and when you're 10
[1:53:24] and when you're 12, when you're in your
[1:53:26] in your teens, and it just intensifies.
[1:53:29] And I'm teaching you here today, say no
[1:53:31] to him.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Say, "My mind is closed to you
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus."
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; You need to say it.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said it on the platform. I
[1:53:45] said, "Satan, I resist you.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; I resist you.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; You're my enemy.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; You're the enemy of these people.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; The scripture says to resist the devil."
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; And conjunction word, he will flee from
[1:54:04] you.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, the devil this and the
[1:54:08] devil that and the devil that." Get
[1:54:10] above that. I'm telling you under the
[1:54:12] message of your messenger, there's a
[1:54:14] higher calling.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; There's a higher calling.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; So, the last messenger
[1:54:27] I've got to quick write close now
[1:54:30] because we have a service this evening.
[1:54:32] Brother Tom is going to be ministering.
[1:54:35] We want to give time for that. give time
[1:54:37] for you to be able to get home and or
[1:54:39] get out and have a little refreshment.
[1:54:42] But the last church age messenger and
[1:54:44] his message,
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; is a higher calling than anything that
[1:54:48] preceded it.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Dear friends,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters in Christ,
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; bloodbought bride of Jesus Christ, you
[1:55:00] have been called under the highest
[1:55:03] calling.
[1:55:05] Your president, your prime minister,
[1:55:07] your governor, your representative
[1:55:09] cannot call you to this. You have been
[1:55:12] called by God
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus revealed
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; under a vindicated messenger
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; proven that could speak. Thus sayaith
[1:55:25] the Lord.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Don't turn from that.
[1:55:30] Turning from that, now you come into a
[1:55:34] state of hopelessness.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Satan would like you to forget
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; these words. Don't forget this message.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Receiving a word, receiving the word for
[1:55:54] healing, I must go quickly.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said is a higher order. He said
[1:55:58] the American people are taught that you
[1:56:00] lay hands on them and I guess you'll
[1:56:02] just have to do that. That's all I know.
[1:56:05] I'm trying to get you to believe.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get you to believe
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; on believe it on a higher order to
[1:56:14] accept it without laying on of hands.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; You just believe it and walk away.
[1:56:24] There's a higher order.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Believe the word.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Believe this word.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; And you can walk away.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; It's done.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Revelation is a higher calling
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; than intellectual learning.
[1:56:59] What's happening
[1:57:01] future home?
[1:57:03] Oh, he said to make known his prophets,
[1:57:06] all his manifestation
[1:57:10] because it's his attributes of his
[1:57:13] thoughts expressed now. And here it is
[1:57:16] in this little woman. He's talking about
[1:57:17] the little woman at the well. She was
[1:57:19] one of his attributes.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; And there was a priest
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; representing the light. There's a priest
[1:57:27] representing the light.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; He had learned it from the Bible.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; He had learned that God was God.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; He had learned that holiness was right.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; And he was learned that there was a law
[1:57:44] of God. He learned it because his
[1:57:47] intellectual conception. Don't sit here
[1:57:51] and just learn these things.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Holy Spirit, I hear it. I
[1:57:55] understand it. But I need it to be
[1:57:57] quickened."
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Come and make it alive.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; You can argue a person out of something
[1:58:04] they learned.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; You cannot argue it out of them once
[1:58:07] it's been revealed.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Once it's revealed,
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; you'll never get it taught out of you.
[1:58:14] Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Why do I believe in the prophet? Cuz the
[1:58:20] Bible speaks of it.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Malachi speaks of it.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke of it.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Isaiah spoke of it. We see it and we
[1:58:28] believe it because it's it's a prophecy
[1:58:30] in the scripture.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; And it told what he would do. And then
[1:58:35] one rises on the scene in that season
[1:58:37] and does those things.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he was born of the right
[1:58:45] lineage. He was a Levite and he only
[1:58:48] knowed it by intellectual conception.
[1:58:51] And when the light of the hour, see, he
[1:58:54] learned it by what had happened, not
[1:58:57] what was happening.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; One thing I'm thankful for in this
[1:59:02] church, friends, we don't come to church
[1:59:04] because of something that has happened,
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; but we are here because it is happening.
[1:59:16] And when he found what was happening,
[1:59:20] his denomination said nothing about it.
[1:59:22] Therefore, he had no representation of
[1:59:25] it.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; But there was a redeemer on earth at
[1:59:27] that time to redeem those attributes of
[1:59:29] God.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; And she received it.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; How thankful we ought to be.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; How thankful we should be that church
[1:59:38] the country is filled with churches.
[1:59:40] They're not preaching that they are the
[1:59:42] final voice to the final age. They're
[1:59:45] not preaching to the people and telling
[1:59:47] them, "You're under the messenger,
[1:59:49] vindicated, proven messenger."
[2:00:09] The third exodus
[2:00:11] is a higher calling than the first or
[2:00:13] the second.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; The change of this body is higher than
[2:00:19] the physical body you have right now.
[2:00:22] Hello folks.
[2:00:26] You got dressed today,
[2:00:29] refreshed yourself
[2:00:31] and came to church.
[2:00:37] The change
[2:00:39] of this body,
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; is a higher calling
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; than the body that was formed in your
[2:00:45] mother's womb.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; We look at these children.
[2:00:51] We look at these infants that are born
[2:00:53] and and Sharon and Marco have received
[2:00:57] their family all at once.
[2:01:00] But I look at those little fingers and
[2:01:02] look at a toe about
[2:01:04] 316 of an inch long. You just can't
[2:01:08] believe all those bones are in there.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; It almost takes a revelation myself to
[2:01:14] believe. And I look at that, look at the
[2:01:17] little creatures and think and look at
[2:01:19] that little ankle and foot. Can't
[2:01:21] believe all these bones are in the foot.
[2:01:25] And then,
[2:01:27] you know, we're smart people. See,
[2:01:30] where'd it come from? Where did all
[2:01:32] those bones come from?
[2:01:35] How come this child knows just exactly,
[2:01:38] you know, when to breathe and when to
[2:01:41] and do all these things? Just a miracle.
[2:01:44] The change
[2:01:46] the change of your body is more
[2:01:50] important than the body you're sitting
[2:01:52] in today.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; This body will age.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; That one will re will will annihilate
[2:01:59] aging.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; This body gets sick and weary. That body
[2:02:04] never will have that.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; This mind is subject to deterioration or
[2:02:09] depression or whatever more. That body
[2:02:12] knows nothing about it. The people
[2:02:15] called of God under this age under this
[2:02:19] message are promised that body.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; In fact is it is the spoken word that
[2:02:27] will change this body.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; When a man or woman hears the word of
[2:02:35] the hour and says, "I don't believe it."
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; You know what they've just done? They've
[2:02:39] just put a big X across the chains of
[2:02:42] their body. Right.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, well, no, you know, we
[2:02:46] don't want to don't become a bleeding
[2:02:48] heart now. We'll stay with the word of
[2:02:49] God
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; because that's unbelief."
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; And no unbelieving
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; man or woman can enter into the kingdom
[2:02:58] of God.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; You have to be a believing person
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; and believe on him whom God hath sent.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:03:12] Is this congregation believing
[2:03:13] congregation? You're believing this.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Remember this.
[2:03:24] Remember this that God cannot change.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; He's the unchangeable God.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Times change.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; People change.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; God is infinite. He cannot change. He
[2:03:38] must remain the same yesterday, today
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; He must always remain.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; And now here I have underlined. Now you
[2:03:49] see here how his message comes because
[2:03:52] he doesn't change
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; how his message comes.
[2:03:57] How he sends his message.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Number one, how his message comes.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; How he sends his message.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; He can't change that.
[2:04:08] He's always done it.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; He will always remain the same. That's
[2:04:12] the way he always does it.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; And remember, when does he do it? Just
[2:04:19] before the destructions.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Just at the end of the age.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; That's when he sends his message.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; That's when he sends his message. Listen
[2:04:29] folks,
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; to call
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; out
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; his people. Yeah.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, this messenger came.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; He came and had this great ministry,
[2:04:43] etc., etc. I could stop at every
[2:04:45] junction."
[2:04:48] I say, "Well, there was a whirlwind in a
[2:04:50] tree."
[2:04:54] And that is true.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I sat with a woman
[2:05:01] that was actually a close friend,
[2:05:04] brother Brandham's before he was
[2:05:05] married.
[2:05:09] He called her his girlfriend.
[2:05:13] I asked him, "Did you know he was a
[2:05:15] prophet?"
[2:05:17] She said,
[2:05:19] "No." She didn't know what that meant.
[2:05:25] I said, she said he and she opened up
[2:05:28] her purse and took out a picture of him,
[2:05:31] the one with the bandana around his
[2:05:33] neck.
[2:05:36] It was signed by him.
[2:05:41] She looked at the picture, looked over
[2:05:43] my head, and said, "I still love him."
[2:05:47] I thought, "You said the right thing."
[2:05:51] I said, "What did he did he ever speak
[2:05:52] to you?" Yes. She said, "He told me that
[2:05:55] he would hear a voice in the tree in the
[2:05:58] trees."
[2:06:01] And here in the message,
[2:06:03] you can find it. He's a boy, eight years
[2:06:05] old, I believe, carrying water.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz his father was a bootleger
[2:06:14] and he carried water
[2:06:17] to his father's still.
[2:06:21] Think of it. that had God wasn't God
[2:06:24] wasn't concerned or bothered about that
[2:06:27] where he's carrying water and he hears
[2:06:29] the voice.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Don't ever smoke or drink or defile your
[2:06:33] body in any way. For when you get older,
[2:06:35] I have a work for you to do.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; You know what that was for? For you.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; God spoke that for you. Amen.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Because he was establishing from
[2:06:48] childhood
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; a messenger that would be worthy of the
[2:06:51] message he was going to carry for you
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; that he could come and finally say and
[2:06:58] they will call out the message to the
[2:07:00] messenger always came at the end of the
[2:07:03] age before destruction.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; He's preserving you from destruction.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Sending a message.
[2:07:14] Believe it friends
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; to call you
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; and there will be a people
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; so that you under that messenger
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; then become the last voice
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; final voice
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; to the final age
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; I don't care who you are when you go out
[2:07:34] of this service today and and go to your
[2:07:37] place of duty tomorrow
[2:07:40] or wherever you are you're walking
[2:07:42] around into the shopping center wherever
[2:07:45] your voice
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; I want you to remember what brother
[2:07:49] Bisco says today the final voice
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; to the final age
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; hallelujah Amen.
[2:08:16] Peace
[2:08:19] is a higher calling
[2:08:22] than distress.
[2:08:25] Unity is a higher calling than division.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; There should have been a lot of amens
[2:08:34] out of that.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Unity doesn't come along
[2:08:44] just by a natural sequence of events.
[2:08:50] It comes by prayer and labor.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. faith.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; And unity is not union and unity is not
[2:09:01] compromise.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; You need to think about that. I've
[2:09:10] needed to think about it. You
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; unity is not compromised.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Unity is something when the Holy Ghost
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; begins to work in the hearts of men and
[2:09:20] women.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Family members. Hallelujah.
[2:09:24] Amen.
[2:09:28] Amen.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; I believe it was President Bush
[2:09:43] and those are that are not his friends
[2:09:46] or and I don't take any position there.
[2:09:50] But those who were not his friends kind
[2:09:52] of mock his statement
[2:09:54] and it's amazing that it statement was
[2:09:57] made in this in this age at this time
[2:10:01] and they apparently I think his father
[2:10:04] even swed the seeds of it that this was
[2:10:07] a
[2:10:10] they were like initiating or
[2:10:12] inaugurating a new age. This is the new
[2:10:15] age and it became a phrase that is
[2:10:18] spoken all over the new age.
[2:10:22] New world order
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; was the phrase.
[2:10:32] What they didn't realize
[2:10:34] is that God
[2:10:37] intercepted
[2:10:39] their national politics
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; with the highest order of his word.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; There's none higher
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; than a vindicated prophet.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Not just a prophet. All kinds of people
[2:10:55] claim prophets. Not someone claiming to
[2:10:57] be a prophet. I'm talking vindicated,
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; proven
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; by signs and wonders and by especially
[2:11:06] the unfolding.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; We have all kinds of prophets, but un
[2:11:09] unfortunately or perhaps fortunately in
[2:11:12] their mouth this isn't revealed.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Just think about it.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; You can put a tape on or hear a voice or
[2:11:23] read a message book. I' I've sometime
[2:11:25] have it playing in my car and I'm
[2:11:28] driving down the freeway and cars are
[2:11:29] zooming every direction and I just feel
[2:11:32] like the most
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; privileged guy on the planet.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; I just listen to that. I say, "Look at
[2:11:40] all these folks going. They're all wound
[2:11:43] up." And here I am listening
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; to a vindicated messenger
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; and before I get from point A to point
[2:11:50] B, something in this opens up again.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and I my spirit is
[2:11:55] quickened, my soul is quickened.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; And just to know, you've been called
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; to hear it.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; You've been given the understanding of
[2:12:06] it.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; You're not learning it. The Holy Spirit
[2:12:09] is with you in your car, in your
[2:12:12] bedroom, in your easy chair in the front
[2:12:15] room revealing it to you. Yeah.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Revealing doesn't come with under a lot
[2:12:22] of tension or got. No, you just sit
[2:12:24] there and let God do it.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Try it out, folks.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; It works.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; It actually works.
[2:12:47] I'm so thrilled and happy about it.
[2:12:54] I'm just
[2:13:07] here about them.
[2:13:11] Earthbound Earthbound creatures
[2:13:15] were not that.
[2:13:19] And I'd like you to just maybe go home
[2:13:21] and you can add this list would have
[2:13:24] gotten so long
[2:13:27] that God has called you. There isn't
[2:13:29] anything in the message. There isn't
[2:13:31] anything that you confront.
[2:13:34] There isn't anything that number one.
[2:13:39] Number one, God has
[2:13:43] God has when he called you, he called
[2:13:45] you to a higher calling than anything
[2:13:48] that you confront.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Then he also in that calling, he gives
[2:13:55] you the wherewithal to obtain it.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Friends, I don't care what it is. I've
[2:14:03] really cons I've really thought these
[2:14:05] things over and I I I'm just looking at
[2:14:08] my notes here because there were so many
[2:14:09] other things that that God was
[2:14:14] impressing me that I wanted to convey to
[2:14:17] you, but you will do it yourself.
[2:14:20] You're going to confront something. As
[2:14:22] soon as you run into a snag,
[2:14:26] I want to see this congregation stronger
[2:14:29] and more victorious. Amen. And soon as
[2:14:31] you run into a pressure, you think
[2:14:33] you're not going to run into pressure.
[2:14:34] You'll be in pressure this next week.
[2:14:36] You'll be in some kind of pressure. When
[2:14:39] it comes, I want you to say, "I've been
[2:14:42] called
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; to a higher calling than this pressure.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; I have a substance. I can't even name
[2:14:48] it. I have an essence. I have a power
[2:14:50] within myself that's greater than this
[2:14:53] pressure."
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; A sickness strikes you and you say, "I
[2:14:56] don't feel good today." You say, "I've
[2:14:58] been called to a higher calling than
[2:15:01] this sickness. I don't care what it is.
[2:15:03] I don't care what kind of disease it is,
[2:15:05] what kind of infirmity it is." Friends,
[2:15:08] I want to see this congregation rise on
[2:15:11] your own. Believe the word that's been
[2:15:13] spoken. You don't even need to be prayed
[2:15:15] for. You say, "Brother Ed, I believe
[2:15:17] that."
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; And you may not need it at this moment,
[2:15:20] but you might need it five minutes from
[2:15:22] now. Amen.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; I drove down the highway yesterday and
[2:15:28] came on right on a bad accident.
[2:15:32] There's one car over on its roof right
[2:15:34] on the main intersection of 40th and 176
[2:15:37] just getting ready to turn. Ambulance
[2:15:39] there, fire engine there, about four or
[2:15:41] five police cars there. Had one fellow
[2:15:44] out. I think they had them laid out in
[2:15:45] the ditch and the car was on its roof.
[2:15:47] Another car was all smashed up. That's
[2:15:50] the intersection. I always have to come
[2:15:52] to church on. I've always told my wife,
[2:15:55] I said, she said, "When are they going
[2:15:57] to put a light here?" I said, "After a
[2:15:59] few people get killed."
[2:16:01] That was about two days ago. And here I
[2:16:04] don't know whether the man got killed or
[2:16:05] or what happened and don't know anything
[2:16:07] about the occupants. But every time I
[2:16:10] see that, I say somebody's plans
[2:16:13] drastically changed.
[2:16:16] this man, this woman, this people, these
[2:16:18] children were just on their way.
[2:16:22] Everything changed.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; It's when something I don't believe in
[2:16:27] just calling on God in an hour of
[2:16:30] disaster.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to get right with
[2:16:33] God or get on good talking terms. Leave
[2:16:37] this church and don't leave this church
[2:16:38] till you're on good talking terms. So
[2:16:41] that when something comes and it will
[2:16:43] come,
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; then you'll be able to say, "Father,
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; father, here I am.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; I'm your son."
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; I've just heard a minister. I've just
[2:16:53] heard our pastor. I've just heard the
[2:16:55] preaching of the word that and that that
[2:16:58] not merely encouraged me, but instilled
[2:17:01] within my soul
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; a higher calling.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; And you've called me to something higher
[2:17:07] than this. And the essence of it is
[2:17:09] found in that message.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; And I read it. Listen, when you read it,
[2:17:13] it's not it's not just for learning.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; It's for revelation.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; I've got to close, but I have to say
[2:17:23] this. The reason why he brings it to you
[2:17:26] is because you have representation.
[2:17:29] Brother Brandham said the priest was had
[2:17:32] no representation.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; She had representation.
[2:17:37] And that's why you can speak and make a
[2:17:40] claim.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; I'm here because I'm a part of a family.
[2:17:45] I never had to join the family. You
[2:17:47] don't have to join the family. You don't
[2:17:49] have to join the church. You don't have
[2:17:51] to join the bride. You've been born and
[2:17:54] and and you were ordained to it before
[2:17:56] the foundation of the world. You were
[2:17:58] ordained to it.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; And God knew everything you're going to
[2:18:02] face.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; And he sent a word so that you could
[2:18:05] live higher than above. higher and above
[2:18:08] that which you're confronted with.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; God did not intend, listen to me, did
[2:18:13] not intend for us to succumb
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; and to bend down
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; and to be bowed over
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; and to become impotent
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; and to become unhappy and to become
[2:18:26] restricted
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; and to become all all twisted up in our
[2:18:30] nature. That is not the life of a
[2:18:33] believer.
[2:18:35] Amen.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to claim it right now while
[2:18:39] you're sitting here.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Something is coming in your mind.
[2:18:43] Something is coming in your memory that
[2:18:45] you've had. You've had something you've
[2:18:46] been wrestling with. Say, "I want
[2:18:49] deliverance from that before I leave
[2:18:50] this church."
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you people, I'm not
[2:18:56] preaching. I'm telling you, you have a
[2:18:58] right to it.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus died for it. He sent all of his
[2:19:03] apostles to preach it. He sent his
[2:19:06] messengers to restore it. And in the
[2:19:08] last one, before destruction comes,
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; and it will,
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; friends, I'm trying to I'm closing right
[2:19:21] now,
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; but it will.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; I think I'm a serious thinking person. I
[2:19:30] don't think that North America
[2:19:32] can survive
[2:19:35] what she's going through right now.
[2:19:38] People saying when the squeeze comes,
[2:19:40] believe me, the squeeze is on. Amen.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; The hurricanes,
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; the tornadoes,
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; the storms,
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; the economy in Europe and in North
[2:19:56] America, the United States, and they
[2:19:58] say, "Well, how will they ever survive?"
[2:20:00] They just right now, and they're even
[2:20:03] said so, print more money.
[2:20:06] How are we going to pay off these debts?
[2:20:09] How is Canada going to pay off its
[2:20:11] debts? How are they how are they going
[2:20:13] to pay off in the US 14 trillion
[2:20:16] dollars? How are they going to pay it
[2:20:18] off?
[2:20:21] Even the interest is hundreds of
[2:20:24] millions of dollars in just a short
[2:20:27] period per per month. I think how are
[2:20:29] you going to continue to support all of
[2:20:31] this?
[2:20:34] Your messenger
[2:20:37] and you are one that have come up onto
[2:20:39] the message said about 40 years ago
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; they're broke
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; and their grandchildren and you are the
[2:20:48] grandchildren
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; will be paying off the debt
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; attempting to pay off the debt.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen friends.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; And where do these storms and where does
[2:20:59] all this come from? God knows these
[2:21:01] storms and and earthquakes.
[2:21:05] One here
[2:21:07] on a few days ago, a couple days ago on
[2:21:10] Vancouver Island and and and something
[2:21:13] something really startled me because I
[2:21:15] heard about three or four people on the
[2:21:17] phone and they were from different
[2:21:19] places reporting and you know what they
[2:21:22] said? They said the ground began to
[2:21:24] shake and we became instantly sick.
[2:21:28] and someone said it and they're way up
[2:21:30] here and someone else maybe 100 miles
[2:21:33] away or 200 miles away and saying the
[2:21:35] same thing and I was standing out and
[2:21:37] everything began to tremble and I became
[2:21:39] sick. A man was saying it. A woman was
[2:21:42] saying it and they're all in different
[2:21:43] places. I've never heard that before.
[2:21:45] I've heard of people being in big
[2:21:47] earthquakes. Never heard of anything.
[2:21:49] You know, this was 6.4 25 miles down to
[2:21:52] earth. A good shake. this this country.
[2:21:56] We may have a we may have a super one.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; All the scientists say so.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Just don't sit in this church and find
[2:22:06] yourself having to call on God in that
[2:22:08] moment.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Say, "I made it right ahead of time.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; I listen to the word."
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; And I want to say something to you. The
[2:22:15] son and daughter of God is greater than
[2:22:18] bullets,
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; greater than earthquakes,
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; greater than storm.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Atomic bomb could land on your house
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; and you'd still be safe
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; as a child of God
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; or go immediately into the presence of
[2:22:33] God.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; God's greater.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because his children
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; are called to a higher calling.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:45] Hallelujah.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet, shall we?
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; we have rejoiced.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, as I spoke these things that are a
[2:23:00] reality to me.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; I pray, oh God, it'll be a reality to
[2:23:04] the people.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; I pray that they will be so energized.
[2:23:07] and as I have some refreshment and come
[2:23:10] back to the house of God, be here for
[2:23:12] our first evening service. Lord, as
[2:23:14] we're coming to this uh uh this season
[2:23:17] of the year and we're having a Sunday
[2:23:19] evening service, oh God, this is the
[2:23:23] Lord's day.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; This is not just a time we're here to
[2:23:26] preach and and have a little service.
[2:23:28] This is the Lord's day.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; May the people talk about the wondrous
[2:23:32] things that you have done. And I pray in
[2:23:34] the name of Jesus Christ, you'll bless
[2:23:37] the word to the people now. Father, I
[2:23:39] pray that they will take it in. They
[2:23:41] will breathe it within their inner
[2:23:43] being.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; And may it be a reality to them
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to sing when we all
[2:23:53] get to heaven.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; You have to sing it. I hope it's not
[2:23:57] that new to you,
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; but I have been singing this. The
[2:24:01] service is not over. So just remain
[2:24:03] here, please. All right. When we all get
[2:24:05] to heaven,
[2:24:11] get to heaven,
[2:24:14] what a day of rejoicing that will be.
[2:24:19] And when we hold
[2:24:22] Jesus,
[2:24:24] we'll sing and shout the victory
[2:24:30] and sing the wonder of Jesus.
[2:24:36] his mercy and his
[2:24:41] in the
[2:24:44] bright
[2:24:54] together
[2:25:02] and we all
[2:25:04] see
[2:25:08] and shout.
[2:25:12] And while we on the field
[2:25:32] we all
[2:25:42] And when we all
[2:25:45] see Jesus,
[2:25:47] we sing and shout equally.
[2:25:53] Let us then be true and faithful.
[2:25:59] The same serving
[2:26:01] every day.
[2:26:03] Just one of him in glory will
[2:26:11] be
[2:26:13] all
[2:26:18] the day.
[2:26:23] And we all
[2:26:25] see Jesus.
[2:26:28] We'll sing and shout the victory.
[2:26:34] One word to the right before us to be
[2:26:41] willing
[2:26:44] to
[2:26:47] open. We shall receive
[2:27:00] and
[2:27:03] we all
[2:27:05] see Jesus
[2:27:08] will sing and shout.
[2:27:13] I have to give you just one more.
[2:27:19] I just can't let you go without giving
[2:27:21] you one more.
[2:27:24] Hardships
[2:27:26] are a higher calling
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; than a life without them.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; The trial of your faith
[2:27:38] being much more precious, higher order,
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; than that of gold.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:46] Yes.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; You know what I was going to do? I was
[2:27:51] going to go down to a currency exchange
[2:27:54] and get a a block of gold, but I
[2:27:56] couldn't quite afford it. But I thought
[2:27:58] I'd like to get it up here and put it on
[2:28:00] the platform. And I just know that
[2:28:03] there'd be glistening eyes, man, if I
[2:28:06] could just get that and take it home.
[2:28:09] Well, you got something more precious
[2:28:10] than that. And you're going to go home
[2:28:12] with it. And it might be a trial.
[2:28:16] Hallelujah.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; And it's more precious. That's what he
[2:28:19] said.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; You already got it, folks.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; You got a whole brick of gold in your
[2:28:30] pocket.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; You go home with it.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; It's more precious than gold.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask Brother John Andy to
[2:28:40] come and ask God's blessing upon you.
[2:28:43] We're dismissed.
[2:28:49] Heavenly Father, what words, Lord, we've
[2:28:51] been hearing from your heart, Jesus.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, how you must love your people and
[2:28:56] how you must desire us to come into a
[2:28:59] secret place with you, God, of oneness.
[2:29:03] As we are just in prayer before the
[2:29:05] service at our home this morning, we
[2:29:08] didn't want just a gathering of people,
[2:29:10] just another service, just another
[2:29:13] church meeting. We wanted you to come
[2:29:16] and speak to us, Lord. That was the
[2:29:18] hunger. That was the thirst. God, we can
[2:29:21] say at the end of this service, you have
[2:29:23] met our hearts cry. You have given us
[2:29:26] food, Lord. You've given us a word in
[2:29:28] due season.
[2:29:30] You've prophesied into our hearts what
[2:29:33] we have need of, God. You've given us
[2:29:36] wings to fly. You've given us healing
[2:29:39] for our bodies. Given us deliverance for
[2:29:42] our souls, given us answers to
[2:29:45] questions. You've discerned our very
[2:29:47] thoughts, Lord. And we want to say thank
[2:29:49] you, Jesus.
[2:29:51] We're not beggars. We're not children.
[2:29:54] We're sons and daughters crying abba
[2:29:56] father groaning for that new body in
[2:29:59] that other place.
[2:30:02] Oh Jesus on this 911 we thank you for
[2:30:05] your amazing grace the leadership of the
[2:30:08] Holy Ghost that saw each one of us and
[2:30:10] provided a way out of this chaos of this
[2:30:13] world that we're not looking back but
[2:30:16] we're remembering and seeing what you
[2:30:18] have right here among us. present word,
[2:30:21] present food, your shakina glory, your
[2:30:24] presence is among us. And how we desire
[2:30:27] to live in that even today, God, that
[2:30:29] every seed and every believer would
[2:30:31] receive the full benefits of the word
[2:30:34] that we've been hearing. God, take us
[2:30:37] all the way into that shikina glory
[2:30:39] place, into that faith realm where all
[2:30:42] things are possible. God, let us receive
[2:30:44] what you have for us. Lord, even this
[2:30:47] afternoon, God, our first evening
[2:30:50] service. But Lord, let us be an assembly
[2:30:53] that does not just gab and talk and
[2:30:56] gossip or talk about our frivolous
[2:30:58] things of life. But let us learn to come
[2:31:01] aside and labor in your spirit and
[2:31:05] refresh our hearts, God, in our bodies
[2:31:07] because there's a word tonight for us,
[2:31:09] Lord. There's a season as you walked
[2:31:12] with Adam and Eve in the cool of the
[2:31:14] evening when so many is caught up in
[2:31:16] frolic and loose living that we can come
[2:31:19] back again and hear from your heart,
[2:31:21] God. Words that are prepared for our
[2:31:24] lives as we so desperately need in this
[2:31:27] hour, God. And we hold on to them with
[2:31:29] everything that's within us, Lord. And a
[2:31:31] greater sincerity and sobriety, God. The
[2:31:35] screams of death are all around us down
[2:31:38] the streets of Leoda.
[2:31:40] Young people and older ones, they are
[2:31:43] without hope and despair. But you've
[2:31:45] given us a Passover lamb. And you've
[2:31:48] given us a message, God, that we can eat
[2:31:50] it in quietness, Lord. And under the
[2:31:52] sound of your presence of the pillar of
[2:31:55] fire, God, just as fresh as it ever was.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Refresh our pastor, God. We thank you
[2:32:01] for the gift within his life. We believe
[2:32:04] one day, God, soon that we'll be on the
[2:32:08] other side gathered under this banner
[2:32:11] with our pastor and the ministry that
[2:32:13] you have led us into our new bodies. We
[2:32:16] will not be ashamed then and we're not
[2:32:18] ashamed now.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; And the ministry you've given us, God,
[2:32:21] this great banner that we can be free,
[2:32:24] God, of our burdens and our cares and
[2:32:27] hear from your heart, God. We don't take
[2:32:29] it lightly. So be with our brother Tom
[2:32:31] this afternoon, Lord. Lord, give him a
[2:32:34] word in due season, God, as we cradle
[2:32:36] these gifts, Lord, for ourselves and our
[2:32:39] families, that you would speak thus
[2:32:41] sayaeth the Lord, in 2011, God, that we
[2:32:44] would be able to go out and say, "I've
[2:32:47] heard from God. I've been in your
[2:32:49] presence, Lord, and you've spoken to our
[2:32:51] lives, and you answered the cry of our
[2:32:54] hearts." Go with every life now. go with
[2:32:57] every individual that's heard your
[2:32:58] message this morning, those on the
[2:33:00] internet, those that are on the phone,
[2:33:02] hookup, even those that are among us.
[2:33:05] God, I just pray that every need would
[2:33:06] be met as we go this afternoon, Jesus,
[2:33:09] shouting, "Hallelujah and thank you,
[2:33:12] Jesus. Praise the Lord." And we cover it
[2:33:14] with our praise and our prayers, God. Go
[2:33:17] with us now, Jesus. Sink it deep into
[2:33:20] our daily lives. We pray in Jesus name.
[2:33:24] Amen.
[2:33:27] Amen. God bless you. We're sending you
[2:33:30] with God's blessings.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we'll see you this
[2:33:34] evening. Greet one another. Let the word
[2:33:37] be uh established in your heart. You're
[2:33:40] dismissed in Jesus name. Amen.
