And brother Brandham said that's what's the matter today with the Christian church can't get anything done is because our hearts are condemning us with unconfessed sins. You know, the Bible says if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; Men, we've all sinned, saints. We've come short of the glory of God. But I'm thankful that there's a sacrifice. Man, the mercy seat is available this morning to every believer. &gt;&gt; So if your heart's condemning you this morning, it doesn't have to in a just an instant of time.

Uh I'm not sure from where, but it's from a distance away. Um and they are requesting prayer for a man by the name of Jonathan uh Levan. Apparently, he's got been in operation. He's got some problems with his heart. So, we want to remember him this morning. And uh there's a request here from uh Sister Carmela. Um there's a baby with a hole in her heart and they just want us to pray this morning. So let's remember this little one in prayer. If you've got a need this morning, just lift before the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. Brother Tom, [Music] why don't we just offer a word of praise? &gt;&gt; Why don't we just thank him? This is the house of praise. house of worship where we can adore him and lift up that name above all names and we've dedicated this day to you, Lord. And we want to blend our voices together, Lord, in adoration and in glory and honor, Lord. We lift up the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you, Lord, for your redeeming love that's been expressed to the likes of us. Lord, you're scouring the world, but God, you had us in your thoughts. We've been redeemed by a love divine. We want to give you praise this morning, thanking you, Lord, for unmmerited favor within our lives, Lord, that you've called us from the four corners of the earth. Called the bride of Jesus Christ, and we want to glorify you, our bridegroom, our redeemer, our friend. And we want to worship you. We want to hear the voice of the resurrection this morning. Oh, we want to hear the voice from the eternities come. Speak through your servant. Lives be changed and hearts be molded. Lord God, that we might be shaped into the very image of God. So Lord, we want to express from the depths of our souls, we love you. We're thankful for a messenger that has come and a message. Lord, we sing about Moses and a token was given, but we thank you for William Brandon. We thank you for your servant. We thank you for the token of the hour. We thank you for the Holy Ghost. We thank you for the protection, Lord God. We see spiritual death throughout the land. But in the church of the living God, we see life, abundant life, Holy Ghost life. Lord, redeem the lost this morning. Set the captive free by your word. If there's any backslider, Lord, restore them to their position in Jesus Christ. Father, for the requests that were read, and hearts that are lifted, hands reaching out to you in faith. Would you meet every need in divine presence? We're asking you'll anoint the man of God that you'll anoint our eyes with eyes to have to see. We just don't want to hear words, Lord, but we want those words to become living &gt;&gt; in our own flesh. &gt;&gt; Let that word become flesh again. Father, bless Brother Rod as he leads the people in worship. &gt;&gt; We love worship, Lord. We love to praise that name. We love to lift it up. We love to glorify you.

Also, anyone who usually attends camp but can't this year, please indicate that on a registration form cuz you know they don't want to if they've if there's a hole, they want to fill it up.

Brother Jonathan [Music] See the banners gleaming Right along the corridors in heaven, proclaiming victory for his precious life was given for all the sins of man. His redeeming blood did pay. But those that stand before him love his holy name. [Music] We'll be wearing robes of white with praise on our lips for he'll have wiped every tear from our eyes. Do you have to ask the question of what we're going to do when we're standing there in heaven? And we have made it through. On that great eternal day, when we hear him call our names, we'll shout in victory. [Music] Oh, and the angels will be silent for they cannot join the song of the redeemed. We'll sing the sing and honor and glory and power to the lamb forever and ever. Then we'll fall down [Music] at his feet. [Music] Do you have a question in your life my precious friend? Do you know where you are going? What will be your end? If you live your life for Christ, then you'll hear him say, "Well done, and he'll give a crown of life for the race you've run. Can you see the ivory throne with the elders all around as they praise with hallelujah and before him cast their crowns. Oh, I can hardly wait to lift my voice where there's there is nothing in this world that can even compare. On that great eternal day when we hear him call our names, we'll shout in victory. Oh, and the angels will be silent for they cannot join the song of the redeemed. We'll sing blessing and honor and glory and power to the Lord forever and ever. And we'll find [Music] that great eternal day when we hear him call our names. will shout in victory. [Music] Oh, and the angels will be silent for they cannot join the song of the redeemed. We'll sing blessing and honor and glory and power to the lamb forever and ever. and will fall right.

[Music] We're really thankful for each of you that are here and the visible audience, the invisible audience, those that are in the fellowship room and elsewhere nursery and wherever they are in the building and those that are streaming. We want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We're so privileged, aren't we? Amen. &gt;&gt; We're honored to have been called, &gt;&gt; to have been justified. &gt;&gt; To be glorified. Amen. We're real thankful that the Lord gave a safe journey to brother Michael, brother Kim. Happy to have them back after a long and in Kim's word arduous journey. Long journey. And of course these types of trips are not it's not just the length of the trip but it's what happens during the journey. And uh I would like uh Lord willing on Wednesday if it would be possible brother Kim to let the people know really what took place in this last couple weeks. It was very very profitable journey. I heard from brother Vernon and brother Vernon said it was just he said it's actually started a little revival over there and I won't say too much but only to say that uh between brother Kim and brother Michael who was doing a lot of video work and we want to be able to have a a real good account and uh more than an account But how the men and the brethren were taught, how the ministers were uh taking a hold of the whole concept of the hub. And they they trained some of these men and quite a few ministers, had them sit down, each one after their computers, and the printers were all put into into alignment as it were, pulled down a message. Uh, and I'm just going to mention a couple things if you don't mind, brother Kim, but pulled down a message on the internet. And this one brother printed a message from an earlier message that he had wanted and held it. And they printed it, stapled it, and brought it out as a book. And this one pastor said, "This is such a rare message." Well, because he hadn't had it before. And uh then some of the young men that were in their late teens, early 20s, they were so quick to pick up on this uh the technology part and they were able to go back to their churches on Sunday and help their pastors and they felt as though they had really gained a position in the church. Now they had uh were a place where they were able to be an assistant to their pastors and that gave them a thrill. I'm telling you this because I wanted to just relate something that I experienced. I had just gotten uh an email from Brother Kim and they were just finishing up in I believe in Manila and were on their way up to Baguio City along about a 12-hour drive and uh and I had just finished preaching here on uh Christ the mystery of God revealed and I get an email from a pastor who's been emailing me on a regular basis for quite some time from Argentina. I believe it's Argentina or Chile. And he does a lot of evangelistic evangelism work. He pastors a church and uh he's very very well connected also on the internet and and uh he sent me an email and this was the first email of this particular type. Usually he's talking about what God is doing and where they're going and where they're taking the taking the message to. But in this email, he said, "You you mentioned in the service on Sunday, you mentioned and made a quote that God loved fatherhood." And he said, "I where is that quote? I'm trying to find that quote and I can't find it." And so I immediately took and pasted the a couple of paragraphs out of Christ the mystery of God revealed and sent it to him on the internet. And it was about 30 minutes after I spoke to you, brother Kim. And here came uh here came this email from this brother and he said uh thank you for sending the quotes. He said this will help with a lot of false doctrine in the country. He said it's such a wonderful quote that God loved fatherhood. He said we don't have Christ as the mystery of God revealed in our country. And he said, and I don't think we have it in many of the Spanish-speaking countries. It is translated into Spanish, but it has not been printed and would cost us about $640 US to print a,000. And we could print 2,000 for a little bit less per book and 3,000 for a little bit less than 2,000. And I I just looked at what it would cost to print the one book, just 1,000 copies of that book. And I thought, isn't it ironic that right at this very moment, here's a brothers on another part of the world giving access to the pastors to the whole message and here's one brother trying to get one book. And all he needs is to get that one printer tie into the hub and he'll have access to all of it. Uh, we're on the right track, brother Tony. &gt;&gt; We're on the right track, sir. And here we have these brothers that have just gone over on the first first occasion. We're we're going to the Philippines. So it'll be kind of a a model a model country. And the Philippines was chosen. They have a lot of English-speaking people in the country. And now the next country we desire to move on to is to uh India. But already we're getting emails. They're sending them to me. I don't know what the office brother Derek or other brothers are getting. But already we're getting word and they're just absolutely so thrilled and not only that people are getting under the burden and saying I will I want to see that a printer gets into a certain country. I just got an email like that from Africa and they want to and from a part that you might think is a needy part but they want to provide a printing station for someplace else. I really think this probably one of the most revolutionary things that's happened since the tape recorder and and I might make some reference to it and I'd like to hear really fully what while it's fresh if it's possible brother Kim for Wednesday if it would be possible and just show the people if you're going to be around. I don't know we talk about it after. So we're happy to have brothers back safely. Uh, brother Rod has mentioned on on next Saturday, July the 5th, we're going to have the camp fellowship day. Uh, the one thing that he didn't mention which is especially important, especially to a lot all our young people, that's it's also barbecue and we got brother Raymond out there and he's going to be preparing food and and so on. So, we want you to be able to come. It's it is a day if the young people wish to put up some volleyball nets, that's perfectly fine on the on the grounds there. uh bring your guitars and have some singing and whatever more. But we have some uh tour guides. Our senior young men are going to be tour guides. And these aren't just tour guides to show you the grounds. They're going to tell you in detail what has taken place and where it has happened and and not only what has happened, what has taken place in the last 6, eight months under the direction of brother uh Chris Peterson and brother Randy Snow and they're going to give the details and then these tour guides will be able to take groups of maybe 15 20 at a time and take you all through the whole whole area in the premises and show you the different things and also to show you uh what we would like to still see take place. So, uh we're really happy about those things. You know, little things happen that you don't really expect. Uh I was just there one of the earlier times and and Sister Sue Aguary was there and I don't know exactly what she was doing there, but she was helping in the kitchen and working around and stopped me in the middle of the kitchen. And I tell you what, it has to be important to stop me when we're in the middle of eating. But she she has something really important. She says, "Brother Ed, I'd like to grow a garden." This is I said, "Kind of, you know, kind of what planet did that come from? I'm just we're we're there with all this tearing this camp to pieces and trying to do do some work and workmen going every direction and and just trying to feed them and get them energized so they can carry on for the afternoon." Says, "I'd like to grow a garden." Okay. I I I suppose there's a spot. I didn't even know there was a place. Oh, yeah. She said they used to have a garden here. And I'd like to have an organic garden. Sounding better all the time. You you know, God bless you, Sister Sue. Just go right to it, you know. Well, she she the seeds were sewn in her mind. She got energized by the thing. But here are some other, you know, brother Chris and he he got bit by it, too. And brother John Le and some of the other brothers. And so I talked about the garden the other day. He says, "I don't hardly have anything to do with it. They've all taken it over." Well, they need to. It's it's it's huge. It's huge. There's enough there to feed the whole camp. I think just think of it. You're not only going to go have camp this year. And uh Lord willing, what we're trying to do also, I just tell you these things a little bit ahead time because the camp's not far away. We're trying to get it opened up to see if we can have two sittings uh for evening meal because some of you may want to come and it'll be the first time we've ever been able to do it. But some and we'll be announcing it formally if we get get it worked out and I think we will where the where you can come early to the camp and and and sit down and have a have a have a dinner there and and then be right there to early to have take in the service. And I think that would be real nice. We build a great big deck that probably hold 300 of you. And uh if it gets too hot where you can just buy an umbrella when you leave, leave the umbrella there. Isn't that it? But brother Chris, too, please. Table and umbrella. &gt;&gt; Yeah, table and an umbrella. See, that's the kind of man you need. God bless you. Well, we're here to uh come to the word in a few moments and uh I have something I want to I would like to continue where I have been for the last two weeks. Uh the mystery of Christ in you and it is very very true. Uh sometime we have a hard time seeing God in our life the way that we should and sometimes things in our lives go sideways. go in reverse but we don't realize that actually it's God in our life we really need to know whether it's God and I remember very vividly when Tom preached some years ago you know why do we go through bad things but he he coined the phrase which became used in this congregation ever since who says it's bad and he pointed to a lot of bad things that happened to people in the Bible, but it turned out for their benefit. So, who said it's bad? They didn't realize it was Christ in them, God working out something in their lives. And so, that's uh that's what I would like to speak about. I'll have you speak and I'll have you stand before I speak. And I'd like to sing that course. Uh I have it written down here, Linda. I want to live the way he wants me to live. And and I've been thinking about the words this course. I would like you to be mindful of it. I want to live the way he wants me to live. That's in line with the service. I want to love till there is no more love. Amen. Let's sing it as a prayer, shall we? I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want you [Music] just know more for I could never ever out love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's just quieten our spirits as we sing it again. &gt;&gt; I want to live the way he wants me to. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to love [Music] until there's just no more love. For I could never ever out love the Lord. with our heads bowed and our hearts bowed. Our lovely Lord Jesus, thinking about your love and the depth of it, trying to understand it, trying to comprehend it, and feeling, Lord, even myself this morning so incapable of grasping the depth of it. But I pray that you'll open up our hearts and our souls, Lord, that we may have a deeper, deeper understanding and that we in simple language just may be drawn closer to God. Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, oh Lord, to thy blessed bleeding side. Consecrate us now, Lord, to your service. I pray. I ask you'll illuminate us by the same Holy Spirit that came on the day of Pentecost and rested tongues of fire upon them. I pray that that Holy Spirit will have the preeminence in the service today Lord and not merely in the service but in our lives. Take us, Father, use us for your glory. No flesh will glory in your presence. And now father I pray that you will make this word alive to us and give ability to speak Lord may my utterance be done and motivated by the Holy Spirit and may it seed fall into good ground I pray in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory. Amen. Amen. I'll have you turn in your Bibles to 2 Corinthians uh 5th chapter. We're just going to read verse 19 and then we're going to go on to Colossians 1. We've been reading these uh verses here and then I have some other scripture reading. So you'll hold your Bible open if you would please. in 2 Corinthians 5:19 to that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation in Colossians the first chapter and we'll start at verse 25 we had read from about verse 18 but now we'll just Start for verse 25 to 27. wareof the apostle Paul speaking. I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to you given to me for you to fulfill the word of God. Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations and now is made manifest to his saints. to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory. Now you know this scripture is very very common and very much used very much believed on by all Christianity but I can I can say of with confidence that without the message you can't really grasp the depths of this and even with the message it's hard to grasp the depths but Christ in you and soon as I hear that I say to myself then what is this Christ what is this force what Is this power and how is it transmitted to me from almighty God? And that's what we've been going through. This is the logos that came out from God. This is what proceeded out from God which was the son of God. He called it. He said it's the Christ. It's the anointing. It's that it's that which came out from the being of God. And the that's why in the beginning all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. the beginning of the new creation, our Lord Jesus Christ. And so, uh, this is the part of this great mystery of Christ in you, the hope of glory. You may have your seats. Keep your Bibles open, please. So, God was in Christ and Christ is in you. &gt;&gt; We never want to forget those phrases. God was in Christ and Christ is in you. This is God's process. This is God's method. This is what God chose. How he chose to transmit and transfer actually the prophet says part of himself &gt;&gt; to you. Now the next thing is that's wonderful and that's all marvelous but the next thing for us is to be so so very very sensitive and we do need to be filled with the same spirit of God because that is the spirit that he sent out from himself. We need to be filled with the spirit of God so we can identify that that indeed is God. And then something that we might think is God isn't God. We need to have that discernment of the Holy Spirit that we might know this is of God. I am I am I've given myself so unreservedly to the Lord. I'm I'm completely unbiased in my thought. I I've I'm in neutral. &gt;&gt; I'm in neutral about the things of life. I'm not, you know, yearning for this or longing for that or whatever more which may taint my decision making and the power of my judgment. I want to just be completely and neutral about these things because the reason I say that is we're always facing decisions. There isn't a day that you don't face decisions. Some of them are much more important. They're major decisions. They're lifechanging decisions and others are just, you know, about our daily life and so on. But even then, we need to know that God is directing our decisions and our footsteps and our our future. So God in Christ and Christ in you. And that ties back to the phrase brother Brandham uses. All that was in God, he poured into Christ. All that was in Christ, he poured into the church. Now when th those aren't only profound statements, they're very very farreaching &gt;&gt; because it it it spans over our feelings. &gt;&gt; However you feel, you may feel great today. You may feel very bad today. You may feel depressed one time. You may feel fearful another time. You may feel in confusion some time. But this these statements span over top of those. God, everything God was, he poured into Christ. Everything Christ was, he poured into the church. Regardless of how you feel or what kind of a day you have, that's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Completely irrelevant to God. It's still the same. God poured himself into. He poured himself. And that's what anointing actually is. And that's why they say the outpouring of the Holy Ghost. The outpouring has a direct reference. And you might say, well, uh, you know, you might remember I spoke on the anointing and and these things tied very very much together. You can't you can't really uh d you know, you can't dissect these these uh statements in these scriptures because they are all interlocked. And so God in Christ and Christ in you is the chosen combination that God is using to bring about his plan of redemption. That's the plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he's using. And this is the central theme throughout the whole scripture. It's a central theme throughout the message. It's a central theme throughout the Bible. And this is the purpose. This is the purpose that God has you in the world. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose. &gt;&gt; And I want to just uh make a reference to the purpose in just a couple moments. But in this message, Christ is the mystery of God revealed. I'll be making some quotes, also showing some slides of the scriptures and quotes that I have uh in a few moments. But but here here it is. First, he said there's a three-fold purpose. First, to express himself completely. Now, I I just want to confess to you that I haven't gotten much further than this in my thoughts over the last weeks. I've been really pondering that God the thing that he was the words don't fit you know words that are that we would use with ourselves don't really fit for him but we became obs we become obsessed with something uh but I I don't want to use that word with God but the thing that that God was uh I would say completely uh uh complete his his whole nature and his whole being was one of self-expression and brother Brown said that's first and he said it was in the back part of his mind and and you have to understand that this was such a a force within God if you can see this it's like life that had to burst forth &gt;&gt; it just had to burst forth and the profusion of life &gt;&gt; the magnitude it's somewhat expressed in the in the species of life, the species of the earth, they they say, and I have some statistics here, whether they're right or wrong, and when I get into scientific statistics, I always get a little bit skeptical. But nevertheless, they say that uh that from the beginning of of their recorded or or recorded scientific research on the various species, they say that there's that we only have uh 99.9% of all living species have are in are extinct. And they're going back like 360 million years, way back to the various eras. uh and and how the how the species have become extinct of and the dinosaurs and all of those things that have been in in some previous time. And uh and I don't even get into that. That's not why I'm here. But all of this life, it seemed that when and I thought of the scripture. It's just so short and yet it's so profound, so a few words. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. Says in him was life. &gt;&gt; And we can just stop there and preach the rest of the service. &gt;&gt; In him was life. In him was every little bug and bird and flower and the colors of the flower and the odors of the flowers and the the fragrance and all of the things. In him was the waters. In him was every living creature. In him was all of the fascination of nature. No wonder the prophet can say God in his creation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And people can see that people are are captivated by it. They're overcome by it. Their their emotions well up. They look at beautiful sunsets or rainbows or storms or or the mountains or whatever more and sit there and stand there and weep with tears coming down. They're moved by seeing God in creation even though they don't know the creator perhaps themselves. But they see the manifestation. They'll see the they'll they'll see the the the salmon heading up and they see that force of of of life within them that they must get back to their birth place and they I watch them and they're beating their bodies and and it's it's actually sad where they put them in and and let their eggs ripen in one of the places where they want to wait till their salmon are ready to give their eggs and those salmon know that they need to go further. They're up the river and they're in a cage as it were and they'll go back there and it is something to see 30, 40, 50, 60 lb salmon stand there and and they've already failed. They've already failed many, many times because it's just a wall up there and they'll go back in this tank and and you can just see that determination. They're moving there and then they'll just take a run. They must be going 50, 60 m an hour and slap their body up against that thing. They're just trying to break through. Something in them has to get home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if that can be in a salmon, how much more in a believer? We run up against a snag. We run up against a blockade. We run up against a stone wall. We run up against a waterfall. But nothing's going to stop the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God was in him. &gt;&gt; In him was life. In him was that force. In him was that drive. In him was all of that magnificence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because he had a purpose. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "But you shall receive power." &gt;&gt; This is the kind of power I'm talking about. I'm talking about overcoming power. I'm talking power that's much greater than in the salmon. Power that's much greater than the instinct that's in the birds that fly for thousands of miles. Power and and a direction if the birds know exactly where to go and the salmon know where to go. There's power that's you and I in you and I knows exactly where to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you'll just release yourself that power, that power will tell you what's right &gt;&gt; and what's wrong. That power will tell you when you're going over the edge. That power will tell you when you're leaning to the world. That power will tell you when you're selling out your interest to the things of this flesh. Uh do you believe me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the same power. &gt;&gt; That power will tell you when you're growing cold and lukewarm. That power is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the very spirit of God that came out of God in the beginning. &gt;&gt; And it was sent out to express God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So much today that is not expressing him. You shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. &gt;&gt; And you shall be witnesses not you might be or you will hope to be. You shall be witnesses &gt;&gt; unto me. Not unto yourself or unto this church. You shall be witnesses unto me, &gt;&gt; both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth. &gt;&gt; Then Paul said in Romans and we know that all things work together for good. Now, don't just lose yourself in the fact that we've heard it before hundreds of times and so many people quote it, but notice how it says. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are the called according that's according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; God has a purpose. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God has spelled out in very very clear terms what the purpose is. The purpose is God was going to express himself. He said he wanted to he he was going to achieve he had a motive in doing this and he was going to achieve it. I can tell you friends whether we're successful whether we surrender whether we yield or not is not going to change the plan of God one iota. &gt;&gt; God's plan cannot be hindered. &gt;&gt; God's plan shall be accomplished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're a son and daughter of God, you will come. You'll come easy the way or the hard way. one way or the other, but you will come. Hallelujah. And all that the father has given me will come. And no man can pluck them out of my hand. But we also as believers need to have that confidence. Nail our faith down. For those that are still outside of fellowship, those that may be backsliden or those that are away from God, we need to pray that the Holy Spirit will go wherever they are this morning and deal with them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Make them miserable. Take their sleep away. Take their health away if necessary. But save their soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the expression of the Holy Spirit because that's the expression of God. His selfex expression is what was his determination. And we are called according to his purpose. In Romans nine also, neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children, but in Isaac shall thy seed be called. That is, they which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of of God, but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For this is the word of promise. At this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son. And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac, for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand. that the purpose of God in other words his purpose could not be deterred. His purpose could not be diminished. His purpose could not be removed. It purpose according to election must stand not of works but of him that calleth. And so the purpose the purpose in the in the Greek as it's used here is the setting forth of a thing. I want you to hold that. The purpose of God is the purpose is to set forth something to set it forth the placing of it in view to bring it into full view. That's God's purpose. So now we take the prophet's statement which gives such enlightenment to this that the thing that God had in his mind. The great secret he had in his mind was that he was going to express himself. This mighty vast ocean of expression. But God was going to express himself and he had a purpose in doing that. A precise purpose. And in his purpose, he had to put he had to put his purpose out into full view. Which brings it down to you and I that are seated here today. Why are we here? We are we are seated here that we might hear the plan of God, the purpose of God and to know that that purpose is to express himself. So we must be conscious that that God God was in Christ &gt;&gt; and Christ is in me. &gt;&gt; And the purpose of that is not to give me a good feeling, not to give me a tingle down my spine, not to just make me to speak in tongues or to have some other gift. That has nothing to do with it. What it has is that God was in Christ and Christ is in me and the I receive Christ by the word. That's why the spoken word is an absolute essential. You hear the word and as it falls into a believing heart, the Holy Spirit comes to that word and makes that word alive. And the life is not the life of a a watermelon &gt;&gt; or another animal or of a human. It is the life of Jesus Christ. And suddenly God has a self-expression on earth. &gt;&gt; And you're expressing Christ. &gt;&gt; We're expressing Christ through the message of the hour. You can't express Christ without the the life can't come without seed. And the seed is the word of God. The seed is not merely the Bible. The seed is the Bible. The word of God revealed to you. &gt;&gt; All kinds of people read the Bible. Agnostics read the Bible. Atheists read the Bible and the Pope reads the Bible. We have a different thought than those people. &gt;&gt; And that's where my confidence goes back. I was saying to my wife, repeating it to her again yesterday, preaching her little service that it it maybe you think, well, I I'm a simple man, which I am, but I go back. I rest back. I go back in the early ministry of the prophet. I go back. I often give you a visual demonstration when he when he stands there and is revealing the secret of the heart of the people. You may think that I'm just caught up with a with a second pull. Not so. That was the manifestation that it was not a man. &gt;&gt; And that's where you better have your faith. When it was not a manifestation that it was not a man that was speaking because no man would know those things. He says, "You know that I don't know those things." Who was that? That was God and God being poured out into the man so that he could pour out into the people the secret of their heart and make it known to them. But now when I come now to the word of God to to things that have much more significance and much more weight, which has to do with my faith being anchored that it's Christ in me. How do you know? Because we believed your word, &gt;&gt; we have believed. Thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; I believed it in its most elementary state and I believe it now in its more uh complex state. &gt;&gt; When I run into things and say, "I don't really understand that." That's fine. But the one thing I do understand, I understand the source. &gt;&gt; I understand where it came from. And I always go back where it came from. And even I don't know maybe things happen in your life or in your in your circle of events are taking place but you can say I know one thing I know where that message came from. I go back to its origin and I know that was God. I know it was not a man and that's what I believe &gt;&gt; and that's why I believe it. So now God, because he has a purpose, he brought you individually. He brought you as an individual to this specific time in the world because he needs your body as a vessel. And I speak to everyone under the sound of my voice. If God brought you here and brought you and opened your eyes to this message, that means that God has a purpose. And I am telling you this morning, his purpose is to express himself. So thus, you are a vessel chosen and called of Almighty God to express Almighty God in this age, &gt;&gt; whatever it might be. Right. &gt;&gt; And obviously it may be something that the world does not is not too prepared to accept. &gt;&gt; So the purpose is to set forth something to expose it to view so that it can be looked at. &gt;&gt; You happen to be here in the world to be looked at. &gt;&gt; And God intended that that you will be looked at &gt;&gt; and that you will be viewed by the world and those around you. And then when they see you, even though they may not hear your words, they will see something that is unearly, &gt;&gt; something that is heavenly, something that is divine, and they will come under an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; I intend to go into this with some depth. Now, with regards to the purpose in this message, Christ the mystery of God, he said if he had if he had this three-fold purpose, if he had this purpose, if God had this intention and this force that was within him, this bursting forth of life, it wasn't just something spontaneous that was going to burst forth from the eternal one, but he had a purpose. that was coming with a direction, &gt;&gt; a direct purpose to make himself known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was just first he said and brother brother Brandham says we want to find out what this three-fold purpose and the first thing was God wanted to reveal himself to reveal himself to the people. When we determine that the purpose of God for all creation was first and foremost to pro to express or manifest himself. When we recognize that then we will begin to be in a place where we can discover what is the purpose of God for our individual life. Now he says in the warning then judgment this just a little portion now has to do with the purpose of God. Says you have to know God and his nature before you can understand his word. &gt;&gt; You should put that down and remember that it's warning then judgment. You have to know God. See, I find so many they think they know God, but and and and no doubt that they do, but then they, you know, they encounter something in their life and go completely sideways and somehow think it's God. And it's not, you have to know God and his nature &gt;&gt; before you can understand his word. &gt;&gt; It's not to know what you want &gt;&gt; and then try and figure it out in the word. That's not it at all. It's the Holy Spirit taking the message that's been spoken and putting it forward. That is the direction and the guide for our life. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; You have to know God and his nature before you can understand his word. He has the key to that word himself and he's the only one can handle it and opens it. And so he's the one has to reveal it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is why I put so much emphasis. And you must I trust you can accommodate me this morning with with your full attention and your thoughts because I'm seeking to know, you know, precisely the the will of God. And I appreciate I've had people I've talked to just this last week in the office, one of our young one of our young men. And he said with all seriousness, he had a certain direction in his life. And he said to me in my study, he said, "Now I don't want the permissive will. I want to know the perfect will." That's a wonderful statement. I don't want the permissive will. &gt;&gt; I don't want what God will allow me to do and go and everything else for my life. I want the perfect will. &gt;&gt; And I believe that God will answer to that kind of a response. He says, "And now we find out that his nature was here to always warn man before judgment, to warn a nation before judgment, and so forth." That was his nature. Just please stay with me. He always gives his warning, a reminder to us of responsibility. We are responsible and God has put us here on the earth for a reason. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; God has put us here. &gt;&gt; And you should probably say with me, God has put me here for a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's put me here for a reason. And that reason that he has put us here for, we are responsible to him for that reason. So we want to be able to say to ourselves, God has put me here for a reason. &gt;&gt; According to the prophet's word, and I am responsible to God for that reason. &gt;&gt; It got quieter and quieter instead of noisier and noisier. &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. God has put us here for God has put me here for a reason. God has put me here for a reason and I am responsible to God for that reason. &gt;&gt; That's a purpose that he's put us here. &gt;&gt; Now we may be farmers or mechanics or engineers or business people, housewives, mothers, single people, students, uh whatever we are, that's what we're uh uh uh that's what we are doing in our life. That's what we're occupied with. Now listen, that is not the reason &gt;&gt; that you're here. &gt;&gt; God may use you in that capacity. He may have led you into that particular uh type of work or that home where you're living. He may have well led you there because there's somebody through the network of life and the way that he's designed it that you're to contact or you're to live before. You're to give a a testimony to just by your life, by your countenance, by your conduct, by your demeanor, whatever it might be or some word that you may say or some book that you may give out. That is your purpose. That's your purpose. That's the reason for you being here. But the reason for you being here is not to live just a certain type of life and live in a certain place. We want to live where we live, work where we work. We want to do what we're doing by the perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; So that we can fulfill our purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you should go to him. He goes on to say God has put us here on the earth for a reason and that reason that he has put us here for. We are responsible to him for that reason. You should go to him in case you haven't done so. I think it's good for us to do so on a regular basis. You should go to him and find out what he wants you to do. &gt;&gt; What do you want me to do? And if you want to work for a man and he gave you a job on a ranch or something another and you just went out to the barn and just sat down out there and said, "Well, see, you must go and ask him what he wants you to do and then do it." He says, "And then if our life here on earth, if our life and then if our life is on the earth here, then we should go to the one who put us here." &gt;&gt; Now, if you just consider that your mother or father or some uh you know grandparents or whatever more some natural lineage brought you here, then you're responsible to them. Better go and ask them what they want you to do. But the messenger said that God has put us here. &gt;&gt; And we need to go to God and ask him, "What do you want me to do?" &gt;&gt; And then go and do it. &gt;&gt; Whatever that might be. &gt;&gt; And it's wonderful to be able to say this morning, I believe. I'm exactly where God wants me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm exactly where God wants me and I'm doing what he wants me to do. But I know that this is a common question. And I'm sure if I asked for the raise of hands, we'd probably have uh a lot of hands that would be raised. I I am even wondering what God wants me to do. I'm wondering concerning that's why I'm speaking this way. But here's some comfort for you and I gave it I've given it in counsel times and I gave it to this young man this last week. And that is that we don't just sit back and wait till God, you know, uh sends a thunderbolt. Like one man I heard about, he was a a a worker on a farm. Exactly. Brother Bram talks about a ranch and and his boss always had told him, "See, listen, uh, when you got it figured out, figure it out first. And when you got it figured out, you're halfway done." And he just drilled him into drill that into him. Just figure it all out first. So one day the farmer had to go to the town and he told him he says now what I want you to do I want you to plow or harrow or disc this field and when he got back the fellow hadn't even started. He was just laying back in the hay stack with his hands behind his head. He said you you haven't done what I told you to do. He said I've got it half done. I figured it out. Sometimes as Christians you know we tend to be that way. we think, well, I'll just wait till God uh, you know, sends a thunderbolt. No, I I suggest you just do the best you can &gt;&gt; and and with a real sincere heart and move forward because I'll give you a scriptural principle which I gave this young brother and have given perhaps a number of you and that is when the apostle Paul he was already in movement he was on route he was he was already going on what they call one of his missionary journeys and he was he was going he wasn't waiting on anybody he was going he was being a witness he was preaching He was doing his apostolic work and he saw a vision from a man from Macedonia saying, "Come over and help us." And so, Apostle Paul simply changed his direction. He he was already in movement. So, he just changed his direction, went to Macedonia. When he got there, it was a woman. Lydia was the one who he first, I believe, encountered there. So you can be going a a direction and you can uh feel confident in your heart that this is the direction God wants me to this is what God intends for me to do and I'm just seeking sincerely to know his will. If it's not if if it if he wants you to do something else he will he will direct you. The main thing is you got to have the number one foundation that is that I know I'm here for a divine purpose. I know that go God God has sent his word my way and I have believed it. And so I pursue the direction I feel to go. I pursue the work or the life or the geographical location. I pursue that. And if God wants me elsewhere or wants me to do something different, my heart is ready to receive it. I say, "Speak Lord. &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, I'm ready to do it." Isn't that a wonderful thing? And we can be at rest and we can be at peace about that. In the meantime, do what your hands are fine to do and do it with all your heart and do it as unto the Lord. And I think that would be good for you graduates that just graduated out of school. This is the thing for you to do. Do what God puts before you. Do with all your heart. Live for God. and realize your real purpose in life is not to do that what you're finding your hands or your mind to do, but do do that which is the purpose and the reason why God has you here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My goodness, time is slipping away and we're just getting on here. He says, "And then if our life is on the earth here, then we should go to the one who put us here. Lord, what would you have me to do? What must I do? Why am I here? If it is to be a housewife, a dishwasher, whatever God wants you to do, then you do that the very best that you know how to do it. No matter how little, no matter how little it is, you must do it. &gt;&gt; I don't find here any place where he says, "If you don't know what to do, don't do anything." Whatever you find to do, do it. &gt;&gt; Do with all your heart. If you haven't got anything to do, I'll give you something to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message expressions, I'm just trying to get over this purpose and the reason for being. Brother Brandon was taking, I believe, a funeral at this time and he said his purpose, his purpose is to show us through the flowers. We're we finally arrived at some spring and summer weather. We're seeing some flowers. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; You might not think it, but I love flowers. &gt;&gt; And uh in fact is I just love color. I say to my wife, you know, dig up those green things and put flowers there. I like color, more flowers. So, she goes and buys flowers. I said, not little ones, big ones. I like lots of color flowers. She'll probably buy a bunch this week. He says he speak and and he shows us through the flowers, &gt;&gt; through the sun, &gt;&gt; through the trees, &gt;&gt; through all life &gt;&gt; that he's the resurrection and the life. &gt;&gt; God resurrects his life when it serves his purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You and I have had a resurrection. &gt;&gt; If you know what the message is all about, we've had a resurrection. &gt;&gt; You've been resurrected &gt;&gt; from death. You were even buried under denominational gravestone &gt;&gt; and God brought you in a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Is that not so? &gt;&gt; And so we've had a resurrection. It says, "And if the flower serves the purpose, its purpose, and God has a resurrection for the flower, how much more for our sister?" He was referring to this sister who had passed away who served her purpose in life. God has a resurrection for those that serve their purpose. We can find our purpose and then serve him. &gt;&gt; So my message this morning has to do at this early stage of the service. We want to know number one, we have a purpose. And that purpose is to be the vessel, the conduit through which God in initial, his very initial outpouring, sending forth the creative power, the anointing from him onto the earth through all the Old Testament to bring forth Christ who was the image who would go to Calvary and life would go from him so it could come down into the church and come down into us for the purpose of expressing expressing. That's God's first purpose of expressing himself. &gt;&gt; That's a marvelous thing, friends. It's just absolutely marvelous. And I hope I you followed me through that real quick progression. Now, there are many, and I just want to drop this in. There are many that do the same thing in life that you do. Look down. I see electricians. I see painters. I see carpenters. See housewives. I've seen students I see here we are preachers there's all kinds of preachers preaching right this minute so what all kinds of people do exactly what you and I do are they expressing God no say well that's a that's a harsh statement &gt;&gt; unless you serve his purpose You that are plumbers or you that are carpenters or you that are businessmen or you what that is not your purpose in life &gt;&gt; that only happens to be a side issue. &gt;&gt; Your real purpose is that God arranged for you to be where you're at &gt;&gt; because you're something in eternity and God needs a certain expression here on earth to achieve something up there &gt;&gt; and that's why you're here &gt;&gt; and that's why you're doing what you're doing. So not everybody who does this, not not all the students who learn and study from exactly the same books that you young people do, that that's not all that's not God's purpose. God's purpose is that he has elected ones who he called. &gt;&gt; And he justified them. &gt;&gt; And he's glorified them. &gt;&gt; He's brought them into his own plan &gt;&gt; by his spoken word. And he gave you the heart and the ability to believe that word. not necessarily to understand it all, but to believe it. And because you believe it, you have become a part of his purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God has a reason here on the earth, and you're part of the reason. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm holding back or I would I could preach a little bit more. Going to just save it. Do we have a little bit of time? &gt;&gt; Now, so God has, don't weary, please. God has sent out from himself his word. Sent out from himself his word and his spirit to make that word live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; But now the letter killth. &gt;&gt; If you have just a word, but he sent forth out from himself his word and his spirit. For the spirit is the element that makes the word alive. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture teaches. And to make the word live in the hearts of the believers, the elected ones. They have been elected to be his witness or his expression on the earth. And you are here. God has done something extraordinary for you. God has done something absolutely marvelous for you. &gt;&gt; There has not been people who walked the face of the earth that could look back just a few years and see the kind of messenger and the kind of message and the kind of vindication that you have. They didn't have books. They didn't have tapes. They didn't have all of these things. And what they did have, they had under great duress. You've been handed it on a, shall I say, a silver platter. You've been handed it, have you not? &gt;&gt; You've been handed it. It's very easy coming. Make sure you use it. Make sure you get good value out of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Does me good. I hear people even, you know, my wife, she just determined to, she's staying with me in this Christ, the mystery of God revealed. She wants to get what the Holy Spirit is wanting to bring to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message that day on on Calvary, I'm just really holding back because I I've got some things I must say here. He said, someone said, now here's our purpose on earth. Someone said to him, how can you stand and let anyone call you such bad names? Saying that to him. How can you stand that, brother Brandham? for anybody to call you such bad names. He said you don't live, he said, you don't, he answered them, you don't live for yourself, you live for others. &gt;&gt; You live for others that you might redeem that man. &gt;&gt; You become sons. And the trouble of it is that the church has forgot they were sons. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; The church has forgot that they are sons. He said, "You are taking Christ's place." God, help us. &gt;&gt; God, really help us to take a hold of that. You are taking Christ's place. You are sons. So, don't live for yourself. Live for others. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandham, I can live for this. I I can live for this brother because he's sure a nice man. He said, "That's not it. &gt;&gt; Live for that man that hates you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, before I read this to you, I read it to myself. &gt;&gt; I scan my horizon. Say, who is it that hates me? Who is it that I need to express God to? I'm having Elijah give me instructions. &gt;&gt; Tell me, love that man. I can't just push it off. &gt;&gt; Says, "Love that man." He said, "Live for that person who'd kill you if they could." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's what they did to him. &gt;&gt; Says they killed him and he died that he might save them. &gt;&gt; That's eternal life. &gt;&gt; When that's in your bosom, you're facing heaven then. &gt;&gt; You know, I hear a I hear that a lot of time. When you're doing good to others, you're facing heaven then. They say it too quickly and I don't know if they say it accurately, but he said here when that's in your bosom. What is it? When that's in your bosom, when they want to even kill you and do away with you. He said, "When that's in your bosom, you're facing heaven then. But you sacrifice your own things. Give them up like the sheep gives its wool and you look look on towards Calvary." He said, "I hope that helps you get in a place." And I hope it does too. &gt;&gt; I hope it helps us get in a place. That's what he says. That's what the tabernacle speaking of his own church. That's what all the people that has has got to do is to find out what you are and what's the purpose. So that's the segment on the purpose. First was to express himself. Going to stay with that. The second the second excuse me is to have the preeminence in his body of believers. So the first is to express himself and the second is to have his preeminence in the body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's the second thing. The first is that he wanted to express himself. The second one comes right in behind it that he could live in his people because that's how he was going to express himself. And the third is to restore by that to restore the kingdom back to way it was when he had fellowship with Adam and Eve in the beginning in the cool of the day. Said it's going to come back but I have to go through this process. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's three words I would like you to notice. First his first purpose was to express. The second word in the second purpose was the preeminence. You know what preeminence is? Preeeminent. He is he is the first and foremost. &gt;&gt; And the third is to restore to express to have preeminence and to restore. All three of those hear me now. All three of those can only happen by this power of this force, this anointing that God poured out of himself. &gt;&gt; And how did he convey it to us? He poured it out. It's called the breath of God which God breathed into his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then that word, that word that he breathed, not just words, that word which he breathed is breathed out &gt;&gt; onto the people. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And Jesus breathed on him, you remember from some services ago, he breathed on them and said, receive ye the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Receive ye my breath." &gt;&gt; As he knew his breath was the Holy Spirit. Receive ye the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. The breath of God. &gt;&gt; And in this day we have received the breath of God. &gt;&gt; Some say, "I received the breath of a Bible school." So be it. It won't get you out of the grave. &gt;&gt; It won't get you out of the grave. That is for sure. We didn't receive it from a Bible school. We didn't receive it from a theologian. We received it from thus saith the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm glad for that. Friends, &gt;&gt; I talked to quite an intelligent person just this last week. I'd say a very intelligent person has a very responsible position. And we began to speak about the wisdom whereby our brother Brandham spoke and I said to this brother because he was astounded. He said, you know what, the grade seven education, he was saying these things not realizing perhaps these things didn't come uh just from the mind of a man that had been developed in a grade seven education. It had a it had come from a channel that has come from God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Otherwise, a person would say thus sayith the school or thus sayith the Bible school or thus sayith the seminary or thus sayith a certain book I read. It's not that. It's thus sayith the lord. &gt;&gt; And that is why. &gt;&gt; So when when he spoke about botney life, brother V spoke about botney life, he sounded exactly like a horiculturist. &gt;&gt; When he spoke about the cells in the body going wild way back in the 1950s and you get a wound and get a sore, a cell goes wild, he begins to describe how the cancer forms and what happens in the wild. He sounds like a doctor. He starts talking about the planets and they're not looking 150 million lighty years straight into space. They're looking into a curve. It's in an arc and they'll find out someday it's it's in a in an arc like that. He sounds like an astronomer. &gt;&gt; He says astounding things. &gt;&gt; He talks about the Earth's crust and how California will sink and the and and how the Earth's crust and and and how they react upon one another. And when he does, he talks exactly like a scientist. Why? Because it's the God of all science. &gt;&gt; He talks about the economics. He's he they should have had him in the White House. &gt;&gt; They to fix their economic problem. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why they had the prophets right there and the kings took military advice from them because they were the greatest strategist there is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might think I'm a fanatic, but that's absolutely the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we've been tapped into such a thing as that &gt;&gt; starts talking about the the the the dimensions of the material, the four dimensions and the dimension that is the ether waves he called it and and said that it carries the voices and voices going through here. Look at the age. He spoke ahead of his time and here we are with voices and the whole space that dimension that he described being filled with the entertainment age. the music that is going, the blasphemy that is going on, all the vile and vulgarity that's going on. But I'm glad to be able to report to you today, the messengergers's voice encircles the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, it's a bleeding word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said when a man dies here, that's how Jesus I never understood it until I got into the message. But when a man dies here, because the scripture says that Jesus died for the sins of the whole world, &gt;&gt; that was a problem to me cuz everybody put it back in the denominational world in the religious world put it back on the man says, "Well, the man has to accept it." The Bible says that Jesus died for the sins of the whole world. And I thought, if he died for the sins of the whole world, then why are man still carrying it? Why is man going to be judged by it? Why is he going to be brought into the presence of God and judged for sins that Jesus paid for? But the prophet says, "As long as he's here in life, that blood is like a ribbon &gt;&gt; around the entire world." But the moment he dies, his spirit passes beyond that protective measure and he stands naked in the presence of God with no blood to atone and he can't come back. &gt;&gt; He's lived his space of time on earth. And he says furthermore, he's caught in a nightmare. I pray to God that there isn't a man or a woman or child hearing my voice today that get caught in that nightmare. If you do, you do so on your own. &gt;&gt; As I tell you how to bypass that, and that is to come to receive the word that the Lord Jesus Christ has spoken in this day. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And pass the judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. That force of life, give me a few more moments, please, if you don't mind. That force of life that issued out from God, not only in its magnitude, in its breath, but also in its depth of character. I need to enlarge on that a wee bit while you think about it. In him was life and the life was the light light of man. In him was life. In him was this profusion. The they said I read a couple of scientific statements. They said that uh whether they're right or wrong I don't know. But this is a number of species that have lived on the earth. They're like numberless un untold millions that have lived on the earth and have gone into existence non they become extinct. And I had a hard time grasping this, but they said 99.9% of life as they know it is lost, is extinct. One article went on to say that there had been five major extinctions and they go back and they've named these various eras when there was uh different forms of life on the earth and they you know do their dating and have their their process to determine this and I don't know when you start getting 360 million years and then the next one maybe 270 million years. Uh but nevertheless, this is what they say. And there have been these five major extinctions. And they say this uh and this is a very very uh credible source that I have says the sixth mass extinction extinction. The sixth there have been five and the sixth mass extinction has begun. says, "As unbelievable as it may sound, after having read through the five mass extinctions, the sixth mass extinction is in progress now with animals going extinct 100 to 1,000 times, possibly, they said, even 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than at the normal background extinction rate, which is about 10 to 25 species per year. So they're saying it's going perhaps a 100 to a thousand times that rate. says rather than a mete me meteorite or large volcanic eruption the alarming decline of biodiversity which is the diversity of the species on earth leading to the current mass extinction is the results of five major human activities. So this isn't something that came from outer space or some something that erupted from internally within the earth. They said this has been caused by man. &gt;&gt; The habitat habitat destruction. I won't go into all of these including humaninduced climate change. Human induced climate change is the result in high amounts of greenhouse gas and emissions primarily carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etc. And we here in Canada are going to start paying some carbon tax and uh starting after tomorrow on our on our gasoline. Believe it or not, it's even actually going to go higher about 2 and a half cents a liter, which times five would be about 12 12 cents on a gallon. we put on they're penalizing us for the pollution that's going in the air, but they say it's not a penalty. They're going to give it back somehow. So, however, but the Bible says, "But the day of the Lord, the day of the Lord shall come as a thief and the night in which the heaven shall be the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall might melt with fervent heat, and the earth also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up." Brother Brandham says in the future home, he said the heavens will be on fire. And he says, he begins to describe the the germ and the pollution and all these things that are in the heavens and the demon forces because Jesus said that Satan was the prince of the power of the air. Brother Brandham says it will not just be a fire, but it'll be a holy fire. And God is going to give this earth a renovation. &gt;&gt; I'm enthused about this renovation. &gt;&gt; I say, God, bring this renovation on. &gt;&gt; Cleanse this polluted place. &gt;&gt; Man is doing what he can do, but he certainly will fail. &gt;&gt; And they're saying clearly that it doesn't say this mass extinction will take place. It says it has begun. &gt;&gt; It's out of control. And science is declaring that it has begun. The pollution and the human overpopulation and the overh harvesting of hunting and fishing and the gathering etc. Brother Brandham says in the message life, listen, I'm taking a little lefthand turn now. Satan won't even let people sit and listen to it to truth to the answer. A lot of time we have the problem and we're dealing with dealing with the problem but from a superficial direction. Don't want to so human. It's so human not to want to get right down to the problem. &gt;&gt; We we skate around it and skirt around it and that's the way we have in the world. And Satan won't let people even listen to it. He says, "So corrupted, mind so far gone, so polluted with the things of the world, they have no conscience." The Bible said, "In the last days, they beheaded, high-minded, lovers of pleasure." Lovers of pleasure. Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. &gt;&gt; Now listen close, Brother Rams asked a question. He says, "When you say the wicked shall not burn eternally, do you mean in hell or in the lake of fire?" I know that it says in Revelation, that's the 20th chapter, that hell and the and the hell will be cast into the lake of fire. If they do not burn eternally, what becomes of them? That's a question in questions and answers. And brother Bram says in three words, they become extinct. They become extinct. Our world, our science, your schools, your teacher, your books, your libraries are absolutely filled with man wanting to preserve because he's nervous. Governments are nervous. The world is nervous. The United Nations are nervous. says, "We're we're losing control and they're burning up the forests and throwing the gases in the air and and all of these things are happening and the species are becoming extinct and we're losing the flora and we're losing all this botney life and we're losing this and we can't get it back and we're getting all the oil out of the earth and we're going to run out of our resources and then there's some said, "Ah, it's just a bunch of nonsense. But but it doesn't take away from the fact that people are concerned about it. And we know from the scriptures that the heavens have to be on fire because they have to be purged from what man is doing. And the prophet said, "Man, it's uh he could destroy himself. &gt;&gt; We can destroy ourselves." Oh, we get to some places and you can go up into the Canadian Arctic or the Alaskan Arctic or the Russian Arctic and and you you go up into the Arctic and you find oh the waters are just so pristine. They're just so beautiful and pure and oh the air is just crisp. There's no in industry, no manufacturing, no nothing. You just feel, oh, this is such a marvelous place. Do you know that the most polluted bodies with mercury happen to be our native Eskimo people because they eat the Arctic char fish and the place that has the greatest fallout of nuclear waste is in our Arctic &gt;&gt; and the people have it in their bodies and it's resident there for the rest of their lives because it doesn't dispense. It doesn't disperse out from them at least very quickly. It goes on throughout their life and are and it's a concern and here they are living the way they always lived and killing the caribou and the reindeer and eating the fish out of the ocean. Everything looks so sublime and it's polluted. &gt;&gt; God saw that. Brother Bram says a flower comes up says expresses God's purpose. Then it comes to fall time and the petals begin to wither and they droop and they fall. He says, "And God has a funeral service and God weeps great tears and rain upon the earth and buries those seeds. has a funeral service so that they can have a resurrection in the spring. Once again, the Bible says that all these things were created for him and by him and without him was none of these things created. And the Bible says also it is for his joy, &gt;&gt; for his glory. And I can't see God getting glory over our mountains being stripped and our earth being just raped of all of its resources and all these things and men spewing from his all this toxics and things into the air. I'm not on to politics, friends. We're going to live here. &gt;&gt; Is that what the prophet said? We're going to live right here. and the the original creator. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're going to think I'm real fanatic, &gt;&gt; but when the when the when the Lord Jesus announced himself to the seventh messenger, he said he's the he is the amen, the true witness and the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; That's the one that spoke to the messenger of this age. &gt;&gt; Listen. And why was the last pull? Why was the last pull of that ministry creation &gt;&gt; to the fishy? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the possum &gt;&gt; to the squirrels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To some men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To brother way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who we have his tapes here. Died there. His wife's a Norwegian nurse and was right there. I've been in their home after he was raised from the dead. Why was this power demonstrated? because it was announcing the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you have become a participant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is burning on me. I have to get it off my off my heart. You are a participant. I said in the last service of his second coming, but you are also a participant of the new creation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because God is expressing himself in his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We maybe don't fully understand that, but nevertheless, that happens to be the case. And he says, "What happens to these people? They they become extinct. There's no more to them." Listen now. The soul goes, the spirit goes, the life goes, the body goes, the thoughts go, the memory goes, and there will be no more thoughts of even evil or it forever for in happened in glory. &gt;&gt; The thoughts go, the memories go, &gt;&gt; everything goes, the soul goes, &gt;&gt; the spirit goes. So they become extinct. And I thought in terms of what I wanted to say to you today, here's men get so deeply concerned with all of these things and want to reverse them. One of the things the Red Cross just gave an announcement this last week and the Red Crescent which is equal to the Red Cross and they said on their news said every year they choose one major disaster that happened in that given year and set it forth as a as a emblem or uh something they want to hold before the people in stark reality to their work. What what their work is humanitarian and to try I also heard just prior to this that they have actually run out of resources because there have been so much disaster in the world &gt;&gt; and people have become donation weary. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hard to continue to give because there's so many directions to give and from the tsunami to Katrina to the tornadoes to the floods and to the fires. They said yesterday California is literally on fire. It's the worst they've had in generations. They have said also that the that the stock exchange has hit its lowest lowest spot in uh June, the worst June it's had since the Great Depression. You know, there's a lot of things that are taking place right now at this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we could speak about all the pressure that is being applied to Israel and the President Bush attempting to see that they get some kind of a peace pack done before he has to leave office. But one of the things that occupies and and the Red Cross has made it the international statement. Not a single not a single disaster but they said that this year is the year of AIDS and they have taken and said both the red crescent and the red cross AIDS will be their focal point. They went on to say, and I have confirmed it also elsewhere, since 1981, when it really became more known and identified, there have been, and I want you to try to absorb these numbers, 25 million people have died from AIDS. 33.2 million are living with it at this time. And another report said 39 million. That's an entire that's larger than many nations. There are many nations that don't have that kind of population. Said two and a half million children and newly affected in last year alone. 207 was 2.5 million newly appointed newly affected I should say. What I'm saying is that and I'm not here to speak at length about it but they have said that some nations in Africa have lost a entire generation because of the youth and the young people who have been affected and some been born with it. Some of the nations have lost an entire generation that's just been taken right out of their whole society. There was not young men and young women to grow into adulthood and to start families and to live an productive life. Believe it or not, friends, it's a mass that is a mass extinction. &gt;&gt; That is a on a mass scale something that's happening. And I'll tell you furthermore, they can have all the movie industry they want. They can have all the Bill Gates they want. They're not going to reverse this one. &gt;&gt; So, we can talk all about all about the species and we can take get all taken up with, you know, all the toxins and everything else that's going into space and what's happening there. Let me bring this on down home. Can you imagine for a moment and just grasp for a moment the cost that cost in dollars, the cost in productivity, the cost to society, the cost of the lost skilled people, gifted people that this demon is taking out of out of life. It's indeed a tragedy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they may say it'd be leveling out or it's increasing. That is that's irrelevant to me. Just absolutely irrelevant. But I can tell you that the the that the world has become a very very concerned place. This friends happens to be, let me jar you. This is the world that God has called you to express him his holiness. &gt;&gt; His salvation. This is the world. &gt;&gt; I don't care what what your place in life is, what kind of work you're going to do tomorrow morning, what desk you go to, or what machine you lay your hand to. Please hear me. That is not your purpose in this life. &gt;&gt; Your purpose is what God has done for you. And why you're here in the service this morning is to hear these words and discover what your real purpose is in life and go out these doors and say, "God, turn me loose. &gt;&gt; I come here to be a witness." And I have been empowered &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit who is the author of this word and he's the author of this message. &gt;&gt; God give me strength and God give you a heart to believe it. &gt;&gt; God give you something. God give you a charge from heaven. God send the fire of God into your bosom and light these words that you'll never forget these words. You're not called here to be just a a workman or whatever more, but you've been called according to the purpose of God, according to his purpose, according to his will. &gt;&gt; For his reason, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. going to be closing in a few moments, but I still have a couple things to get out get out. A lot of people sitting in churches and they've been contacted one way or another. They've been raised within a certain family and so they're in churches. You're very different. Not because I'm telling you you're very different, but this whole thing this whole thing that happened with the message is completely different. Because when God when God pays a special visitation talk about this which he poured out from himself and it came all down through the testament Christ was in it. It was called Christ. It was called Christ. I'll bring you back two two weeks ago. Christ was in Abraham. The prophet never said Jesus was in Abraham. Said Christ was in Abraham. Christ was in Moses. Christ was in Joseph. Christ was all the way down. It was Christ. And he says how could he become a son? Only through Christ. How could he do this? Only through Christ. How could he do this? Only through Christ. When he spoke about Abraham, he says that was not Jesus back there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus hadn't been born yet. When Elohim stood before Abraham and told him, I will come according to the time of life, and Sarah thy wife shall have a son. Where is Sarah thy wife? She's in the tent behind you. I will surely come to her. Said that wasn't Jesus. &gt;&gt; It was Christ. &gt;&gt; It was this power, this force. &gt;&gt; It was manifesting. It was Christ in Abraham's time manifesting in Christ all the way down through. And then Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus was born, the Christ, &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. Jehovah, the self-existent one in a body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The anointed one. Others were anointed, but he was the anointed one. The Lord Jesus Christ. And what was he? He was the image, &gt;&gt; perfect image of the invisible God standing here on the earth. &gt;&gt; In other words, this God that desired expression now had a physical vessel on earth that he could dwell in &gt;&gt; in his fullness. &gt;&gt; The invisible God, God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. No wonder God could not hold his peace. When he came up out of the water, the voice thundered out, "This is my son." &gt;&gt; It seemed as though God couldn't hold it any longer. This is what God had been waiting for. He had flowers and dinosaurs and all of these things in the heavens and the galaxies and all these, but now was a focal point. His personal presence had reached the earth. Redemption had started. &gt;&gt; Redemption had come to a critical place. &gt;&gt; And he went down into the water and was baptized. And when he came up, the voice spoke and the prophet put a little different language. Are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; Saying, "This is the first part of my earth that I have redeemed." Because now Christ was not just one. It was not just the self-existent one coming on down through Abraham and Moses and all the rest of but now it was the Christ God in a body &gt;&gt; and the body was a body of the earth. &gt;&gt; It was of the earth. That's why it said of him he should not see corruption. That earth could not go back to corruption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is why when they went back, oh my goodness, I hope I can preach and I hope you can listen. That's why when they went back into the tomb, his body was gone. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That earth that made up his body was not laying in the tomb. It was gone. It was changed. what he ate, what his mother ate in potatoes or cabbage or whatever more they eat over there and nourished his body, it came out of the earth. She took it into her body, in her system. And the little child Jesus came with a body issued into the earth. Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. And God was in Christ. All that he all that he poured out all through the ages now was poured into that one person Jesus Christ [Applause] with different blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Redeeming blood. Blood of a new creation. &gt;&gt; Blood of a new species. A new species arrived that will never become extinct. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll never become extinct. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And God had him here as a savior. But there was another reason. Now he had his personal presence there in an individual. And that one began to move and began to identify. &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; Follow me. Follow me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; Begin to identify certain ones. &gt;&gt; And they begin to follow. What was it? It was a super race. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was another group. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were destined for the upper room. They were destined for the same spirit that was in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was the beginning of the new creation of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In 2,000 years of church ages and we come down to this sophisticated cultured scientific age that we're in. And now God once again sends his personal don't escape it. Send his personal presence back to the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In a man &gt;&gt; that one was virgin born and this one was born in sin but redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. became a fully adopted son of God called the seven church age messenger &gt;&gt; and his his expressed purpose on earth was to be one in a prophet office whom God could come to and he'd reveal the secrets of the hearts but the main thing was to come and reveal the secret of God's heart and when he did he said the first secret is he wanted to express himself that's his first secret. And his second secret is he wanted to manifest himself and have the preeminence in your life. &gt;&gt; You're not a plumber. You're not electrician. You're not just a housewife. He came to have the preeminence in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This other is just a sideline &gt;&gt; just to carry you through life. &gt;&gt; We need to come to the reality my purpose is to express the almighty God. Don't ever forget this service. &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget it. &gt;&gt; I just been so burdened. &gt;&gt; Just been so moved. Oh God, take this congregation and let them catch this. &gt;&gt; Let them catch it for once. Let them catch it in such a way it'll never leave them. And God had one come, the spirit of Elijah to the earth. That's why revivals broke out all over during his time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one to come and then out from his mouth shall come a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that message is the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you felt something move you. It was him calling you my brother. &gt;&gt; Him calling you my sister. Him calling you my young person. It was him when that word spoken uh it caught a hold of you. That was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Calling your name and telling you in no uncertain terms, your name is in the book. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm here now to open the book. And I'm telling you, your name's in the book. And that's why you feel what you feel. That's why you're moved like you're moved. And that's why you're a different congregation from any other. [Music] You've been identified, sir. &gt;&gt; Your purpose. &gt;&gt; And that identification tells you what your purpose is here on earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He loves you, friends. &gt;&gt; That's why he's done what he's done. I hope that you'll take this word this morning. I've been long. It said a lot of things. Hear it again. &gt;&gt; I've been pondering these things very, very deeply. And I felt urged and directed by the Holy Spirit to say it in a very specific way. Take it and hear it. Listen to it. You've been called by this word. &gt;&gt; Called by this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And in closing, let me say to you, when you start out tomorrow morning, you begin to live your life, if a certain attitude or a certain feeling or certain something comes up, why don't you put it through the filter? Say, will this really express him? Will I be an expression of him? I want to express. I want to be the expression of God. And to express the encyclopedia Britannica will tell you to express is to put something forward to bring it into view so that it can be seen, to show it. And that's what you're called for. That's what your purpose in life is. to express and put forward and manifest our Lord Jesus Christ who is the image of the invisible God. God bless you. Let's bow our heads, shall we? Father, how honored, how privileged we are that we have been called, called by such a marvelous, marvelous word. And Lord, you're speaking to our hearts. We do not know just to what depth, what degree, but I pray that each one in their own respective way, in their own personal way, will say even now in their heart, Lord. I've heard you speak. Here am I. Here am I. Take me. Use me. Work in my life. If I've done wrong, forgive me. Wash away my unbelief. Wash away my sin. Wash away my resentment. Wash away everything that's contrary to your will. I pray that you will take me and let me let me be a tool in your hand. Lord, let me be fruitful in the place you've put me. And if I'm in the wrong place, move me out. Here I am, and I'm willing, oh God, to do whatever you want me to do. I pray father your will will be done on earth and in earth in these earthn vessels in the name of Jesus Christ. Bless all who have heard today I pray for your glory in Jesus name.

Lord, at these closing moments of this gathering, of this time we've spent together, this is my prayer, my earnest prayer that you will take and shape and form us individually to be more like you. Lord, I will be most rewarded if you will take these this time, these words. Let your Holy Spirit now take a hold of the words and deliver them down to the deep recesses of the heart. And may the ears of the inner ear, Lord, continue to ring out with these words. And how you have desired to make yourself known, express yourself. Let the individual, each one, Lord, feel that special call, feel that special drawing that that's what I want to do. That will be my main purpose in life. This will be my main priority. Oh God, oh God, take this congregation and make it a mighty voice for the gospel of Jesus Christ. Make it a mighty voice for this message throughout the earth. Oh God, let there be many fires that will begin to burn Holy Ghost fires. Oh God, I pray that you will take and remove any hindrance and obstacle out from uh within this congregation. Oh God, move, oh God, any ill desire that may be here. If there's any that hanker for the world, oh Lord, show that to them even now, Lord. And may they say, "Father, take that out from me. Dispel it out from me. I give myself to you. I surrender myself to you. Here I am. I lay myself down. Here I am. Take me, Lord. Take me. Take all of me. Take me and use me, Lord, as you see fit. Oh God, what is it you I know you've sent me to this world. What is it you've sent me here for?" Father, I pray that you will just take with a supernatural grace and power do a molding in the lives of each individual. And as we go from this place and as we're dismissed, as we drive in our vehicles and are seated in our homes or our chairs or our rooms today, this evening, whenever. Father, I pray that you will draw near and may there be not a few, but many, many that are under now the sound of this prayer. May they become conscious of the divine one that's near them. Lord, may it be such a drawing, such a pulling that they will just give themselves freely. Let tears from their eyes flow, Lord Jesus, if needs be. But at your divine presence, we feel so blessed and also needy. &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll send us with joy and happiness and peace from this place. I pray you'll make us fruitful in your kingdom. Bless this week, oh God, and the services throughout the week, Wednesday, Seattle, the day of fellowship at the camp. May it be a blessed, blessed time. In the name of Jesus Christ, protect us, I pray in the hollow of your hand. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. It's been a pleasure to be with you this morning and uh I just believe that God has a special love for those that love his word, want to express him. May you have a glorious, victorious week. Jesus name, you're dismissed. Amen. God bless you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] What are you doing? [Music] Hello. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] uses [Music] God. Father Lordastace [Music] Jesus.
