[0:00] the book of the prophet Isaiah chapter
[0:03] 53 who hath believed our report and to
[0:06] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for
[0:09] he shall grow up before him as a tender
[0:11] plant and as a root out of a dry ground
[0:14] he hath no form nor comeliness and when
[0:16] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[0:19] we should desire him he is despised and
[0:21] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and
[0:24] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[0:26] were our faces from him he was despised
[0:29] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[0:32] borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
[0:35] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[0:37] of God and Afflicted but he was wounded
[0:40] for our transgressions he was bruised
[0:43] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[0:45] our peace was upon him and with his
[0:47] stripes we are healed all we like sheep
[0:50] have gone astray we have turned everyone
[0:52] to his own way and the Lord hath laid on
[0:55] him the iniquity of us all he was
[0:57] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[1:00] open not his mouth he is brought as a
[1:02] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[1:04] before her shears is dumb so he openeth
[1:07] not his mouth he was taken from prison
[1:10] and from judgment and who shall declare
[1:12] his generation for he was cut off out of
[1:14] the land of the living for the
[1:16] transgression of my people was he
[1:18] stricken and he made his grave with the
[1:20] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1:23] because he had done no violence neither
[1:25] was any deceit in his mouth yet it
[1:27] pleased the Lord to bruise him he he
[1:30] hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[1:32] make his soul an offering for sin he
[1:34] shall see his seed he shall prolong his
[1:37] days and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:39] prosper in his hand he shall see of the
[1:42] travail of his soul and shall be
[1:44] satisfied by his knowledge shall my
[1:46] righteous servant justify many for he
[1:48] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[1:50] will I divide him a portion with the
[1:52] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[1:55] the strong because he hath poured out
[1:57] his soul unto death and he was numbered
[1:59] with the transgressors and he bare the
[2:02] sin of many and made intercession for
[2:04] the transgressors
