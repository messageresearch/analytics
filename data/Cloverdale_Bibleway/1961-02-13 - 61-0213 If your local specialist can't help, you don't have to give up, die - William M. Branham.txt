Description:
61-0213 It Is I Be Not Afraid-1: William Marrion Branham
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but then I'm not a doctor I know nothing about medicine or operations I honor and believe in medicine and operation I believe there God sent blessings to us but sometimes we get to a place to where it's beyond what our Medical Science can handle then when it comes to that I think instead of giving up and dying we have a right to come to the great position if you're a local doctor couldn't help you you'd have a right to go to a specialist and if the specialist came help you then let's go to The Specialist of specialist Jesus that's why I'm here not to take the doctor's patient but to pray for the doctor's patient God's child and my friends
