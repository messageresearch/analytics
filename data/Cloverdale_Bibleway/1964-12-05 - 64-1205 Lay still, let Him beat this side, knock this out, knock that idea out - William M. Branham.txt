Description:
64-1205 The Identified Masterpiece Of God-2: William Marrion Branham
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
one man surrendered into his hands fully that's all God needs but you see we're not willing to lay still and let him beat this side that side knock this out knock that out knock this idea out and that and let Jesus Christ be reflected in it we see too many movies we got too many televisions we got too many other worldly amusements until the church has lost its taste to the people it's because the holy spirit moves out and something else Moves In that's right friend
