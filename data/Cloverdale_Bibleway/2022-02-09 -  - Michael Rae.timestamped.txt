[25:50] well
[25:51] in about a week and a bit we have camp
[25:54] already
[25:55] think of that my goodness
[25:58] it's been two years since we've had a
[25:59] winter camp
[26:01] two years
[26:02] wow and to think that we almost didn't
[26:04] have that winter camp is also thank you
[26:07] lord for our pastor who said we're
[26:09] having one
[26:10] so but here we are two years later still
[26:13] standing and we're ready for the lord to
[26:15] do a mighty work this really meet us in
[26:17] a special way but we're having a
[26:18] pre-camp service next wednesday because
[26:21] butter andrew glover's going to preach
[26:22] here next wednesday so man we're going
[26:24] to just
[26:26] i wouldn't say don't pull too hard but
[26:27] uh
[26:28] leave a little bit for kampa
[26:30] amen
[26:31] so in louis just as in prep for that
[26:35] there's just a couple little pieces we
[26:36] will have a counselors meeting this
[26:38] sunday and you will be receiving an
[26:39] email soon about that those that will
[26:41] counselors will need you there
[26:43] and so just expect
[26:45] those that do get an email we will meet
[26:47] in the back in the chapel there
[26:50] on rides i do want to just make a little
[26:52] announcement just about carpooling when
[26:54] we go down because it's not as simple as
[26:56] it used to be
[26:57] two years ago
[26:58] and so those that are i haven't heard
[27:01] any but if you have an issue with
[27:02] driving
[27:03] down there we need to know who would
[27:05] have some space and if you're needing a
[27:07] ride down because maybe parents can't
[27:10] drive
[27:11] down to the state side and and also on
[27:14] the way back
[27:15] so that
[27:16] you know someone isn't stranded and and
[27:19] can't get back because a parent can't
[27:20] come and pick them up on the sunday so
[27:22] we do need to be aware and so if you
[27:24] don't have a ride and you need one
[27:26] please call the office and let us know
[27:28] and then uh if you do have actually
[27:30] space in your car when you're going down
[27:33] and coming back if you could let us know
[27:35] at the office as well and
[27:38] saying that
[27:40] those that would be maybe calling saying
[27:41] i need a ride make sure you're
[27:43] self-sufficient and self-sustained on
[27:45] your device and your arrive can and all
[27:48] of that the driver is not going to be
[27:50] loading you on their app
[27:52] and if you have no clue what i'm saying
[27:54] then you really need to call the office
[27:56] because you'll be in trouble crossing
[27:58] the border
[28:00] so if you've never crossed the border
[28:01] and you have no clue about arrived can
[28:03] it's your first time to do that for this
[28:04] camp as such please do call us at the
[28:06] office and we'll give you a a real good
[28:08] rundown of what what you need to do
[28:10] because it's a serious business there
[28:12] really serious business at the border so
[28:14] we want to make sure that we're you you
[28:15] have the information need all right so
[28:17] there's that there
[28:24] i think i'll just leave it at that amen
[28:27] well let's turn to our bibles this
[28:28] morning this evening
[28:30] this morning
[28:31] that's a funny joke
[28:35] thank you musicians
[28:41] we're going to turn to deuteronomy 31.
[28:47] i'm just going to
[28:49] take a little bit of a maybe a part two
[28:51] per se of the last service we spoke and
[28:54] just take a maybe a bit of different
[28:56] direction but it's stepping off and
[28:59] we've preached last time on battlefield
[29:00] battle for truth
[29:02] amen and we said the battle was still
[29:04] raging and it still is even today
[29:07] right
[29:08] we left this left off the service just
[29:10] ending with with elijah and the showdown
[29:13] there at mount carmel
[29:14] and uh but we'll so maybe just read that
[29:16] scripture thereafter but we'll just uh
[29:18] just open
[29:19] with deuteronomy 31
[29:22] and 22.
[29:33] good to see everybody tonight
[29:35] wednesday night we are having a
[29:36] baptismal service on sunday
[29:39] amen
[29:41] so if you're feeling a tug in your heart
[29:44] there's water in the tank
[29:46] and there'll be someone baptizing
[29:48] amen
[29:50] glory that's not a small thing for the
[29:51] lord to move upon a heart somebody
[29:53] that's a that's that's a big deal
[29:57] even in this day and hour
[29:59] truth can prick someone's heart
[30:01] say you know what i want to give my
[30:02] heart to lord
[30:04] that's an amazing thing i'm so thankful
[30:06] for
[30:06] that deuteronomy 23 and 20 story 31-22
[30:11] moses therefore wrote this song the same
[30:13] day and taught it to the children of
[30:15] israel
[30:16] and he gave joshua the son of none a
[30:18] charge and said be strong and of good
[30:22] courage for thou shalt bring the
[30:24] children of israel into the land which i
[30:26] swear unto them
[30:27] and i
[30:29] will be with thee
[30:31] amen
[30:33] i'll just note there be of good courage
[30:36] is what he was told but it was a charge
[30:38] it was pretty forceful
[30:40] it wasn't just like maybe think about it
[30:43] it was a charge
[30:44] all right
[30:45] and this wasn't this was god speaking
[30:48] through moses now maybe turn over to
[30:50] first kings just to refresh our mind a
[30:51] little bit
[30:54] 18 and 20.
[31:03] that was a chapter where
[31:05] elijah
[31:07] was a show down there
[31:09] at mount carmel
[31:12] and that in a verse 20 i'll just just to
[31:15] kind of bring it back where we were ahab
[31:17] sent under the children of israel and
[31:18] verse 20 there chapter 18 gathered all
[31:21] the prophets together under mount carmel
[31:23] and elijah came unto all the people and
[31:24] said how long
[31:26] hall g between two opinions
[31:28] amen we talked about
[31:30] truth and false and if the lord be god
[31:33] follow him but if baal
[31:35] then follow him
[31:37] and the people answered him
[31:40] not a word
[31:42] my
[31:43] let's just pray
[31:46] heavenly father
[31:51] we're so thankful we have a place to
[31:52] gather tonight
[31:55] so cognizant lord that it wasn't
[31:57] this way just a few months back

[32:05] lord they're doing many different things
[32:07] now i wouldn't even
[32:08] mention lord over a pulpit
[32:11] but lord
[32:12] would you go to the believers in china
[32:14] right now
[32:16] here we can enjoy each other's
[32:17] fellowship we can sing the songs of zion
[32:20] lord we can open your word and you can
[32:23] speak to us lord through it
[32:26] and lord our brothers and sisters lord
[32:27] are battling and
[32:29] suffering lord in a different situation

[32:34] supernatural
[32:36] outpouring of strength and grace and
[32:38] mercy lord
[32:40] for lord we're a body and when they
[32:42] suffer we suffer and so we lift them up
[32:44] before you lord
[32:46] that you would lord be so near and
[32:48] special to them
[32:49] tonight would you be the same to us
[32:52] lord would you meet our needs the cry of
[32:54] our heart as we sang the song casting
[32:57] all our cares upon you lord may no one
[33:00] hold their cares back
[33:02] and lord hold them into their heart and
[33:04] just lord
[33:05] not mention them lord you are the great
[33:07] burden-bearer
[33:09] and lord may they may you just express
[33:11] to them you say i can take your burden
[33:13] tonight

[33:16] that near that personal tonight we would
[33:18] be so grateful
[33:20] for that lord we pray break your word
[33:23] open it lord to our not just our natural
[33:26] human ears but lord our spiritual ears
[33:28] and eyes that they would be open to see
[33:30] and receive what you'd have to speak to
[33:31] us lord
[33:33] we'll yield ourselves to you now in
[33:34] jesus christ's name
[33:36] amen you may be seated
[33:46] i'm going to just
[33:48] speak a little bit on as i said the
[33:49] battle for truth but i want to take you
[33:50] just a bit of a subject or
[33:53] off shoot of it and i want to speak
[33:54] about men and women of courage
[33:56] men and women of courage is because in a
[33:58] battle
[34:00] if you're lacking thereof and courage
[34:02] you might as well just stay off the
[34:03] battlefield
[34:05] because that's probably one of the
[34:06] particular things you need fighting you
[34:07] need some serious courage as you come
[34:09] against a foe and so i just want to
[34:10] speak about courage in our day and and
[34:13] uh and then and the need for it and what
[34:14] it is a little bit but i can imagine
[34:16] that elijah when he went up there at the
[34:19] show down there on mount carmel you know
[34:21] we can just read over and kind of glaze
[34:23] over the scripture or read it for just
[34:25] the you know the text but you know when
[34:27] you really get into the story i can
[34:29] imagine that elijah as he walked he was
[34:31] all alone as he walked up that hill in
[34:34] preparation i can i would imagine and
[34:36] believe the lord had shown him already
[34:37] what was happening as he was a prophet
[34:39] i'm sure he was going there with full
[34:40] confidence of what the lord was going to
[34:42] do
[34:43] not wondering what was happening but
[34:45] that would have taken i would even in
[34:47] that he would have been filled with some
[34:49] serious courage knowing god was going
[34:51] before him and here he was a one-man
[34:52] battle against all of baal and all their
[34:55] priests and such
[34:56] and i just
[34:58] you know marvel here we couldn't put
[35:00] ourselves in elijah's sandals
[35:02] and recognize what you know what those
[35:05] positions took even think of brother
[35:06] branham and the different ones and the
[35:09] what they went through we look at the
[35:10] ministry of each that they have and he
[35:13] said wow
[35:14] what it would be to be elijah or brother
[35:16] branham or whatever but what a sacrifice
[35:19] the toll that they took
[35:21] they needed courage to bear the weight
[35:23] of that ministry to bear the weight of
[35:25] that burden
[35:26] and uh
[35:28] you know so we were just speaking last
[35:30] service
[35:31] and there's as we we talked about a
[35:33] battle and yes there's different ideas
[35:34] of man we talked about truth and we
[35:36] talked about relativity and truth
[35:38] and that but you know
[35:40] it's good to it might be good to isolate
[35:42] that and recognize it
[35:45] but
[35:46] which side are you fighting on
[35:48] which side tonight are you fighting on
[35:49] you you've seen it we spoke about it
[35:51] last service but i want to know whose
[35:53] truth are you fighting for
[35:55] and are you really willing to fight
[35:58] for the truth that you're you're
[35:59] standing for you know you you answer
[36:01] your own question who who am i standing
[36:03] for god's truth or some idea of my own
[36:06] and is my own idea really worth standing
[36:08] for and fighting again fighting for
[36:11] because you
[36:13] i would really if i was fighting it
[36:15] about i really want to know
[36:16] what i was standing for
[36:19] that it was worth
[36:20] the cost that i was willing to give
[36:23] it was if i was in war and i was
[36:25] fighting i'd want to know that
[36:27] what i'm fighting for value was really
[36:30] equal to my life because that's what i'm
[36:31] willing to lay down
[36:33] right
[36:34] and so the warriors that fight to do
[36:36] that you must have courage to do that
[36:39] and courage is is a mental or moral
[36:41] strength to venture or to persevere and
[36:44] withstand danger or fear
[36:46] or difficulty
[36:48] courage is daring or it's daringness or
[36:51] dauntlessness gallantry it's guts it's
[36:53] gutsiness
[36:55] hardy hardy hood as they s as it says
[36:58] hearts and heroism intestinal fortitude
[37:02] somewhere deep down
[37:04] inside
[37:06] it's moxie it's nerve it's prowess it's
[37:09] stoutness it's valor
[37:11] and it's virtue
[37:12] those are all
[37:14] aspects of courage
[37:17] so courage adventure persevere through
[37:19] difficulty something that's super hard
[37:20] something that's you know very very
[37:22] difficult or you know something to
[37:23] manage or overcome it's just beyond
[37:25] maybe the
[37:26] your your ability and so you're having
[37:27] to dig down deep
[37:29] into some some other realm
[37:31] this would take
[37:33] many cases some courage you know we're
[37:35] as humans we're a little bit averse to
[37:37] difficulty
[37:38] we don't really like difficulty do we
[37:41] no we don't say what it is humans don't
[37:44] like it they want the easy way that's
[37:46] just natural to mankind you're going to
[37:48] find the easiest way and so courage is a
[37:50] trait that pushes someone beyond or into
[37:53] the beyond the realm of just easy it's
[37:55] an inner strength that you draw down on
[37:57] something that shows you it and when
[37:58] there's something difficult it pushes
[38:00] you past you know into that realm and
[38:03] you can go beyond just the status quo
[38:06] it's when you pull up and pull pull in
[38:08] some inner realm of courage
[38:09] now it has nothing to do with your your
[38:11] physical biceps
[38:13] you know or your your pictorials or your
[38:15] ab muscles it's not it's not based on
[38:17] your physical strength right
[38:19] your hamstrings or anything of that how
[38:20] fast you can run how far you can throw
[38:22] how many chin ups you can do it just
[38:24] doesn't really matter courage goes
[38:25] beyond that realm so you say well i'm
[38:27] not i'm not a muscle-bound guy
[38:30] and not a girl hopefully not but uh it
[38:32] doesn't really matter courage is forever
[38:35] it goes beyond that realm and so it's
[38:37] it's a mental realm
[38:39] it's a it's a different realm it's it's
[38:40] and it will go into spiritual realm you
[38:42] know if you think about
[38:45] sometimes are limits you say well that's
[38:47] too difficult me i can't go i can't
[38:48] really go beyond that you know the navy
[38:50] seals they have a 40 rule or or kind of
[38:53] rule of thumb
[38:54] and they say your max is really 40 of
[38:56] what you can do
[38:59] really
[39:00] yeah
[39:01] it's all up here
[39:03] it's really all up here
[39:05] we think our bodies tap out but it's
[39:06] really actually our bodies have it in us
[39:09] physically it's just our mental
[39:11] capacity stops us and says it's game
[39:13] over ain't gonna happen there and a
[39:14] fellow was talking about it and he he
[39:17] had a navy seal come to his house and
[39:18] they were talking about this issue and
[39:20] he says you know how do you do this how
[39:21] do you push past you know past the into
[39:23] that realm of difficulty and they said
[39:25] well you know he says get he they did
[39:28] some chin ups he says give me eight you
[39:29] know give me some chin up something as
[39:30] you can do and he he squeaked out eight
[39:32] chin ups
[39:33] [Laughter]
[39:36] well okay he
[39:38] he mustered up eight chin-ups
[39:41] i said okay good for you
[39:43] i said now he goes do some more
[39:46] and he
[39:47] put out six chin ups
[39:49] all right he said do it again
[39:52] three chin ups you know
[39:54] he's like couldn't do it anymore not
[39:56] even one more his arms were noodles and
[39:59] it was just over so he had you know
[40:03] 17 chin-ups in total or so you know if
[40:05] you add it up right
[40:07] and uh
[40:08] but what happened and so then the seal
[40:10] said all right now give me a hundred
[40:11] more.
[40:15] it's just not it's just not there
[40:18] this said it wasn't there
[40:20] but actually
[40:22] one by one he did a hundred more
[40:26] one at a time
[40:27] one at a time and he squeaked out not
[40:30] just squeaked that's like blew out a
[40:33] hundred more and so his body actually
[40:36] had the ability to do it it was just a
[40:38] mental limit that wouldn't let him get
[40:40] past it right and so you might feel like
[40:43] well i don't really have what it takes
[40:45] i'm feeling weak and i'm i'm feeling
[40:47] tired or i'm the devil's really
[40:48] hammering on me and you feel like well i
[40:50] just don't have the courage to really
[40:52] keep going i don't really have what's in
[40:53] me to really press on it's a mental
[40:55] thing actually you have it spiritually
[40:58] down there and you need to look in the
[40:59] word of god because that's what's going
[41:01] to open up and tell you no there's more
[41:03] there and so we just say hey read this
[41:05] scripture read that scripture and he
[41:07] starts to open up well i can do one more
[41:08] i can do one i can go another day i can
[41:11] get through this trial because it's
[41:12] actually just a devil trying to put a
[41:14] little limitation on what you're
[41:16] actually capable of doing spiritually
[41:18] amen so remember the 40 rule
[41:22] in everything you do
[41:24] naturally and spiritually there's more
[41:25] you got more there
[41:27] so courage is this trait that maybe some
[41:29] would be would feel is rare maybe it's a
[41:31] fringe trait these days
[41:33] and uh you know as people aren't willing
[41:35] to withstand but i looked at different
[41:37] examples of great courage in the past
[41:39] and different names came up as you would
[41:41] look at
[41:42] situations that people did and you look
[41:44] and you're like wow you know they really
[41:45] went to next next level we think of
[41:48] people like abraham lincoln who really
[41:50] took the took the courage to stay the
[41:52] course and eliminate slavery
[41:54] which that would have taken a lot of
[41:56] courage to stand where he would have and
[41:58] the opposition that he would have dealt
[41:59] with
[42:00] there was a a man who just recently
[42:03] was running and jogging and he saw a bus
[42:06] plummet into a over a uh a trolley car
[42:10] actually over an uh uh over a dam and it
[42:12] went into the water and it uh it dropped
[42:15] in there and he was just running he
[42:16] jumped in we didn't even think about it
[42:18] just jumped in and he started saving
[42:19] there was 90 something people in there
[42:21] he was able to save 20.
[42:22] and it effectively went into a coma for
[42:24] 45 days himself
[42:26] he just went down there was just
[42:27] something something that was there he
[42:29] didn't even know it was there
[42:31] you don't even know it's there until you
[42:33] get into a situation
[42:35] as something starts to pull up within
[42:37] you a deep courage that you didn't know
[42:39] existed so sometimes it's the trial that
[42:41] you're going through that god's wanting
[42:42] to pull out of you
[42:44] to let you know you got something deeper
[42:46] than you think like i could never do
[42:48] that but then you go through something
[42:49] you oh god why am i going but he's
[42:50] saying no because you got something deep
[42:52] down inside your soul you can do this
[42:56] amen
[42:59] fellow the name of roy benavidez
[43:03] he was a
[43:04] soldier
[43:05] he took 37 wounds in a six-hour fight in
[43:08] vietnam
[43:09] trying to extract a 12-man troop that
[43:12] was a reconnaissance troop and they just
[43:13] went it just went bad
[43:15] and he he jumped on a helicopter that
[43:17] was coming that was just bringing some
[43:19] some reinforcements and he jumped on on
[43:21] it just to go in he was at command
[43:23] center
[43:25] and then he gets dropped in in the next
[43:26] six hours through multiple helicopter
[43:29] crashes and and a six-hour firefight 37
[43:34] wounds
[43:37] and they he wouldn't even let them pull
[43:38] him off until he knew the last guy that
[43:40] they could get was out
[43:41] and just and also bodies not even just
[43:44] wounded but the dead
[43:45] and he was given a medal of honor for
[43:47] that again something far far down
[43:50] in the trials of a real deep very hard
[43:53] situation
[43:55] something starts to well up inside
[43:57] and i was thinking of our brother henry
[43:59] walter as i was thinking heroes of our
[44:01] even right here right now going through
[44:03] a deep deep situation that's a modern
[44:06] day cloverdale bible way hero of courage
[44:09] amen i was thinking about a ron spencer
[44:11] who's been preaching for these
[44:13] numerous years now after after the devil
[44:15] trying to take him away and say you only
[44:16] got a few months but something deep down
[44:19] starts to wet up and say
[44:21] not happening something a strength
[44:22] within that's a spiritual courage within
[44:25] stands up and says i'm fighting this
[44:26] battle satan amen brother henry you
[44:28] fight the battle
[44:31] i was singing brother brother kim is of
[44:33] beth as you mentioned her last sunday
[44:35] she took that step by step up as you
[44:37] were doing that hike i said that's
[44:39] nothing short of a supernatural courage
[44:41] deep in a heart that can just take one
[44:43] step at a time with the battle raging
[44:45] inside of her body satan trying to take
[44:47] her but that's courage that's a courage
[44:49] within that wells up i say saints that's
[44:52] inside of you god might be just molding
[44:54] you a little bit or a certain trial a
[44:56] little bit but he's finding a courage
[44:58] that he said joe you could actually take
[45:00] that and look back and say whoo
[45:01] i went through that
[45:03] i got i got i'm a courageous
[45:06] god charges joshua to be courageous
[45:10] we'll go there
[45:16] that was deuteronomy and joshua
[45:19] it says have not i the lord commanded
[45:22] thee
[45:22] so he charges him in deuteronomy and
[45:24] then commands him
[45:26] be strong
[45:28] and courageous
[45:30] lord
[45:31] be strong of good courage be not afraid
[45:33] neither thou be dismayed for the lord
[45:34] thy god is with thee wither so ever thou
[45:37] goest so it's actually not even an
[45:39] optional characteristic it's not
[45:40] optional
[45:42] not really we're charged
[45:45] were commanded
[45:47] i said well i might not have it you will
[45:50] you will when you get there
[45:52] amen
[45:54] yes sir
[45:55] but you know
[45:56] when you with when someone someone like
[45:58] that soldier that could go and take 37
[46:01] wounds and i mean they were all over
[46:03] it's because he believed in something
[46:06] he believed what they were doing
[46:09] was right
[46:10] and so he was willing to give it all
[46:12] all the way to the death all the way so
[46:15] when truth is at your back
[46:17] you're willing to go all the way you're
[46:18] willing to give out everything you've
[46:20] got amen you make sure truth is at your
[46:23] back spiritually speaking amen check you
[46:26] say what am i actually standing for
[46:28] right now
[46:32] what am i standing for
[46:34] men have died in all these wars because
[46:36] they stood for something for truth or
[46:39] what they believed was whether it was
[46:40] freedom whatever they were standing for
[46:43] and then when the spies went into into
[46:45] uh into the land to spy out the land and
[46:47] caleb and joshua went in there
[46:50] and moses said what the land is whether
[46:51] it be fat or lean whether it be wood
[46:53] therein or not or be
[46:55] and be of good courage and bring of the
[46:57] fruit of the land
[46:58] now the time was the time of the first
[47:00] ripe grapes
[47:02] and so we know this well moses had been
[47:04] telling him to go and spy out the land
[47:06] go in there 12 spies two of them being
[47:08] joshua and caleb and they had to believe
[47:11] that moses was telling the truth way
[47:13] back
[47:14] in exodus 3
[47:16] god told moses he says i'll take you to
[47:18] a land of milk and honey
[47:21] amen so moses knew god had already told
[47:23] him but they had to believe what moses
[47:25] was telling him was truth that's what
[47:27] they were relying on go into the land
[47:30] seek it out this is the land that god
[47:31] has given us and now they're willing to
[47:33] go in there and start spying out what
[47:35] was gonna happen
[47:36] and it was v so here he goes and delet
[47:38] and he's and we're gonna deliver you
[47:40] which they did
[47:41] so now part one has happened i'm gonna
[47:43] take you out of egypt i'm gonna take you
[47:45] out of this land with a mighty hand and
[47:47] so now that has been vindicated moses
[47:49] word and now here it is go spy out the
[47:52] land so he says now be courageous go out
[47:54] there and find it and so now they could
[47:56] put their backs against a vindicated
[47:58] word of a prophet because the prophet
[47:59] that spoke to them saying god's going to
[48:01] bring you out of this land of egypt and
[48:03] he did
[48:04] now he's saying now go into the land and
[48:06] spy it out because god's given it to us
[48:09] it's a land of milk and honey it's
[48:11] overflowing it's ours go and take a look
[48:13] at it bring back some first fruits
[48:15] because it was the land of the first
[48:16] ripe grapes or the time all right he
[48:19] told us he told us a word already it
[48:22] came to pass that's a true prophet he
[48:24] said go into the land spy it out it's
[48:27] going to come to pass we can be
[48:28] courageous because our back is against
[48:31] truth what he said came to pass so i'm
[48:33] going forward not afraid
[48:36] amen
[48:37] that's where caleb and joshua were
[48:41] so now here they go and they told him
[48:42] and they said
[48:44] in numbers we came under the land
[48:46] whether thou sent us and surely it
[48:49] flowed with milk and honey so now that
[48:51] they're confirming once again the words
[48:54] you spoke are true
[48:57] nevertheless
[48:58] the people be strong to dwell in the
[49:00] land and the cities are walled and very
[49:03] great moreover we saw the children of
[49:05] anak the amalekites dwell in the land of
[49:07] the south and the hittites and jebusites
[49:09] and amorites and the canaanites by the
[49:11] sea
[49:12] and caleb
[49:13] stilled the people he says whoa
[49:15] hold it now
[49:17] moses told us this he told us that god
[49:20] would bring us out of egypt and it came
[49:21] to pass he told us it would be a land
[49:24] flowing with milk and honey and it came
[49:25] to pass so what do we worry about be of
[49:28] good courage it's our land
[49:31] oh
[49:32] oh you know people say no ain't
[49:33] happening
[49:34] let us go up at once he says and possess
[49:37] it
[49:38] why not
[49:40] you can be courageous in the face of the
[49:43] enemy when you know you stand on truth
[49:46] that's the point stand on truth and you
[49:48] can stand toe to toe with the enemy and
[49:50] say i'm coming it's mine he said possess
[49:53] it and i will
[49:55] amen but if you stand on your own
[49:57] concoction of truth don't you dare step
[50:00] your toe to the devil because he'll
[50:01] wallop you
[50:07] but the men went up with him and said no
[50:10] we're not able
[50:11] to go up against the people
[50:13] for they're stronger
[50:15] than we
[50:16] my two out of 12 of those spy 16
[50:20] or so
[50:21] said
[50:22] that we're able caleb and joshua
[50:24] and here they come back from the land
[50:26] it's a good land but they didn't have
[50:28] the courage
[50:30] to overcome it
[50:32] didn't have the courage to overcome it
[50:34] because they didn't believe
[50:37] the word they were given
[50:40] saints we've been given a prophet's word
[50:42] we've been given a word in this day
[50:44] we can stand on thus saith the lord just
[50:47] like joshua and caleb and we can possess
[50:50] the promises of god for they are true
[50:53] and they have been vindicated it's a
[50:55] vindicated word just as joshua and caleb
[50:58] could stand on that and say uh it
[50:59] happened time and time again so can we
[51:02] stand on a vindicated word say this is
[51:04] our land the word of god's been opened
[51:07] up to us i'm taking every promise and
[51:10] the book is mine
[51:11] amen
[51:14] amen
[51:15] but abram says i believe we're at the
[51:17] judgment seat speaking to cadence barnea
[51:19] he says we're crushing crossing over
[51:21] let's not make that mistake that they
[51:24] made
[51:25] he says they gathered out of each tribe
[51:27] 12 spies as we talked about in there
[51:29] grasshoppers they say doubting god's
[51:32] promise
[51:33] it's a pleasant land
[51:34] we can take it we can't take it because
[51:36] we're too small but joshua and caleb
[51:38] wasn't looking at how big the walls was
[51:40] how big the man was they were looking to
[51:43] what god had said
[51:46] saints let's look to what god had said
[51:48] we've had some services over these last
[51:50] months that have been laying down faith
[51:53] have been building up your faith have
[51:55] been bringing us to a point and i'm just
[51:57] saying take courage
[51:59] god's word is not going to fail we're
[52:01] standing on the true word of god it
[52:03] don't matter what the circumstance says
[52:05] just stand strong
[52:12] he says to you dear philadelphian people
[52:15] regardless of how the wind blows how it
[52:17] seems this way or that way how many
[52:19] threats come outside the world keep your
[52:22] mind on what jesus said he give us a
[52:25] promise it's already ours he says i
[52:27] don't care how great opposition looks
[52:30] god will fulfill his word let's look to
[52:32] the word it's here for us
[52:36] amen
[52:38] amen
[52:39] so no courage
[52:41] if it's false
[52:43] but if it's true
[52:44] you can stand really anchored and strong
[52:47] amen
[52:49] and so here
[52:51] now when it's false
[52:53] let's contradict this or contrast this i
[52:55] should say
[52:56] wrong word
[52:57] for we have heard it said just just
[52:59] another chapter past joshua 1.
[53:02] they said well we've heard how the lord
[53:04] dried up the water this is rahab
[53:06] speaking from the red sea and when he
[53:08] came out of egypt and what he did to the
[53:10] two kings of the amorites that were on
[53:11] the other side of jordan see han and og
[53:14] and we were utterly utterly destroyed
[53:17] and as soon as we heard these things our
[53:19] hearts did melt neither did there remain
[53:22] any more courage
[53:24] not a dime of it a heart melted there
[53:27] was nothing left why because they heard
[53:30] the god that was could hear and answer
[53:32] prayer a god that could deliver them out
[53:34] of the israelites what what what they
[53:36] heard the stories and they seen it
[53:38] happen they heard what happened and it
[53:39] was true and they're like oh dear
[53:41] goodness if that happened there it can
[53:43] happen here and there was nothing what
[53:45] were they standing on a big mighty
[53:47] fortress
[53:48] circumstance looked pretty huge
[53:50] right they could run chariots or
[53:52] whatever across the walls they should
[53:53] have felt pretty secure but their hearts
[53:55] melted because there was a god that
[53:58] parted a red sea there was a god that
[54:00] completely destroyed the mighty power of
[54:02] egypt and so here jericho is like our
[54:04] hearts are gone and our courage is empty
[54:06] because they had nothing to back up
[54:08] against
[54:09] amen satan's got nothing to back up
[54:11] against he's got a bluff to back up
[54:13] against so when that's exactly you say
[54:16] uh-huh sorry devil you just want to hear
[54:17] what's happened this is what my god did
[54:20] what are you able to do that his heart
[54:22] will melt
[54:23] because he's got no truth to stand on
[54:27] not an ounce of truth
[54:34] the father of lies is what he is
[54:37] so
[54:38] why would you want to step into his ring
[54:40] and in his corner
[54:42] why stand on his side and believe what
[54:44] he's trying to tell you
[54:45] why why do that why fight for him be
[54:48] like well this is what the devils why
[54:50] why would you do that
[54:53] it's a losing battle
[54:55] standing in his ring saying
[54:57] i need to switch sides
[54:59] i need to switch sides on the other side
[55:00] we heard about on sunday as a as a
[55:03] roaring lion did we not hear that but
[55:06] the lion as we heard in the last two
[55:08] services went about roaring the lion of
[55:10] the tribe of judah has prevailed as the
[55:12] scripture says that's the sight i want
[55:14] to be on i want to be on the side where
[55:16] truth prevails so i can stand with
[55:18] courage and fight and say um devil
[55:21] your your heart is melted amen
[55:28] courage
[55:30] god don't want cowards
[55:32] don't want cowards but abraham said that
[55:34] he can't use you if you're afraid to
[55:36] take his word
[55:38] and believe him he wants gallant
[55:40] men
[55:42] women
[55:43] won't pay attention to nothing
[55:45] but what the lord says
[55:47] that's the kind he has to move with
[55:51] gallant
[55:52] men and women
[55:55] we need men of courage
[55:57] we need women of courage
[55:59] and you know
[56:01] courageous men is not exactly
[56:04] the going trend
[56:06] today
[56:10] i'm going to stop there for a little bit
[56:13] because it's an age of weak-kneed men
[56:17] little high-shorted little fruity
[56:18] tooties running their little little
[56:20] jogging things and pumping their little
[56:22] weights and they're as manly as a paper
[56:24] clip and that's the age we are in right
[56:26] now
[56:28] and it's weakening
[56:31] it weakens the people
[56:33] and far be it for that to be in the body
[56:36] of god's people
[56:38] amen so we're just going to knock the
[56:40] devil
[56:41] a little bit and say not in this body
[56:43] not in the body of christ we're men
[56:46] where men are men we're manly men of god
[56:49] who are courageous men of god who take
[56:51] god at his word
[56:55] a real man no he's a man with
[56:58] fortitude
[57:00] fortitude's a strength or firmness of
[57:02] mind courage of soul
[57:05] which enables this person or this man to
[57:07] encounter danger
[57:09] with coolness this is fortitude this is
[57:11] a man
[57:13] okay he can bear pain or adversity
[57:16] murmuring depression or despondency
[57:17] that's that's a that's what fortitude
[57:19] means so strength of mind that's
[57:20] conviction
[57:22] you're strong on what you believe you
[57:24] have principles
[57:25] that's that's this is fortitude courage
[57:28] of soul
[57:29] so we got courage of soul spiritual
[57:32] courage
[57:33] bearing adversary adversity some pain
[57:36] he's got some strength to endure this is
[57:38] a man who's got fortitude and a man is
[57:42] basically a man
[57:43] when he stands on principle he's a man
[57:45] when he stands on principle his
[57:46] convictions has courage to uphold that
[57:48] principle and the strength to sustain
[57:51] the attack against it amen he has
[57:54] fortitude
[57:55] amen that's a man
[57:57] in this day
[57:58] i'm just going to try and bring
[58:01] some simple definition down to a man
[58:03] now women on the other hand that's not
[58:05] how they are
[58:06] they they seek to be a they're more
[58:08] they're protected they they need to be
[58:10] nourished and cherished as we would
[58:11] maybe use some words that's normal for a
[58:13] woman but a man he's he's out he's he
[58:16] he's ready to take it on he's a
[58:18] protector that's what a man is that's
[58:20] what a man should be
[58:23] if i preach this out there i probably
[58:25] wouldn't be too popular and be like well
[58:27] that's nothing but the man that i am
[58:28] around that's what men should be
[58:33] man on the other hand is designed by god
[58:35] to be a protector to be a savior for
[58:37] their family if you will
[58:38] for their wives for their children to
[58:40] provide security accomplish what's
[58:42] necessary to the well-being of the home
[58:44] and all that is needed to provide the
[58:46] haven
[58:47] for the woman and children that's what a
[58:48] man is but abram says he wants men
[58:51] that's got backbone
[58:52] not a wishbone
[58:54] a man
[58:57] but if we add in a little bit you can be
[58:59] all that it's fine but if you're not a
[59:01] man that your principles are said in the
[59:03] word of god you're no man at all
[59:05] you're no man at all because your
[59:07] principles and your conviction need to
[59:08] be founded in the truth
[59:10] god's word and that's a true man when
[59:13] you're founded and so a christian man is
[59:15] the is a man of the word who knows the
[59:17] truth has convictions about the truth
[59:20] and their non-negotiable
[59:21] non-compromising convictions and because
[59:24] of those he's courageous to confront
[59:26] anything that assaults it
[59:29] this is a man
[59:30] amen and he has a strength to withstand
[59:32] the confrontation that's manliness
[59:37] but abraham says and you men
[59:39] they'll let your wife do a thing like
[59:41] that smoke cigarettes i got a little i
[59:43] got a little respect for you
[59:44] you know a man's the head of the house
[59:47] as long as he takes his place
[59:50] as long as he takes his place
[59:53] that's the place a man should be head of
[59:56] the house
[59:57] i'd like to see a man a man he says a
[1:00:00] man's not judged by how his muscles he
[1:00:02] got that's beast a man's not judged by
[1:00:05] the brawny muscles but he's judged by
[1:00:07] the bags in his knees of his pants where
[1:00:09] he's been praying that's what takes a
[1:00:12] man
[1:00:14] i can tell you brothers
[1:00:15] you might not
[1:00:17] this takes courage
[1:00:19] to stand like that kind of man to live
[1:00:21] that kind of man's life i'm just
[1:00:23] speaking courage today to live a godly
[1:00:26] example of what a man is today
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:32] because you are getting force fed
[1:00:35] whether it's on a bus stop or an
[1:00:37] advertisement on your phone or something
[1:00:39] like that something totally different
[1:00:41] than that
[1:00:42] totally different some weakness
[1:00:44] perverted thing that's a man that's what
[1:00:46] god wants a conviction deep in our heart
[1:00:49] and soul
[1:00:50] i said let's raise up and make sure men
[1:00:52] of god that's exactly where we stand
[1:00:57] a man is character
[1:01:00] not beast but abram says but character
[1:01:02] i've seen man that's weighed 200 pounds
[1:01:04] not an ounce of man in them
[1:01:06] amen
[1:01:08] character nothing to do with your size
[1:01:10] and shape it has everything to do what's
[1:01:11] inside
[1:01:12] head of your home
[1:01:14] even as christ is the head coming from
[1:01:16] scripture listen here the man is a ruler
[1:01:18] don't you think he'll rule you'll rule
[1:01:20] the house you're not the ruler of the
[1:01:21] house you're absolutely says you're not
[1:01:23] a slave now he's speaking to about the
[1:01:25] women he says but you're a hell mate
[1:01:27] the man has the rule over his wife and
[1:01:29] he's responsible solely for his wife god
[1:01:33] makes the man
[1:01:34] answer for his wife that's what he says
[1:01:38] ephesians wives submit yourselves to
[1:01:39] your husbands eyes unto the lord for the
[1:01:42] husband is the head of the wife even as
[1:01:43] christ is the head of the church
[1:01:45] there and he is a savior of the body
[1:01:47] therefore the church is subject unto
[1:01:48] christ so let wives be to their own
[1:01:51] husbands in every thing
[1:01:54] scripture lays it out men take your
[1:01:56] position as head of your home
[1:01:59] amen as christ is head of the church
[1:02:02] amen how christ leads the church not
[1:02:04] with a brute fist not with an iron club
[1:02:06] so does man of god that are courageous
[1:02:08] stand and lead a home as head as christ
[1:02:11] leads the church
[1:02:13] govern the home and is responsible you
[1:02:15] know that a man is doubly better brown
[1:02:17] said he's guilty of double when he lets
[1:02:20] his wife do something out of order he
[1:02:22] says and by the way a man that let his
[1:02:23] wife do that he's guilty of double
[1:02:26] because he's supposed to be the one that
[1:02:28] has the say-so in the house
[1:02:30] heavy responsibility
[1:02:32] men
[1:02:33] fathers husbands young men to be fathers
[1:02:36] if the lord would tarry this on your
[1:02:38] shoulders that's why you want to be a
[1:02:40] god-filled courageous man of god
[1:02:43] because you're going to stand
[1:02:44] responsible for everything your wife and
[1:02:47] family does
[1:02:48] that's a heavy responsibility man
[1:02:54] i know you probably didn't expect this
[1:02:55] tonight
[1:03:00] likewise the husbands dwell with them
[1:03:02] according to knowledge giving honor
[1:03:05] respect reverence and esteem is what
[1:03:07] that honor means honor unto the wife as
[1:03:10] unto the weaker vessel as being heirs
[1:03:12] together of grace of life that your
[1:03:14] prayers be not hindered
[1:03:18] my
[1:03:19] there's a connection there brothers with
[1:03:20] how you actually treat your wife giving
[1:03:23] honor unto her as the weaker vessel and
[1:03:25] being heirs together in the grace of
[1:03:27] life that your prayers be not hindered
[1:03:32] all turmoil and whatever in the home and
[1:03:34] you're not treating each other well and
[1:03:35] then you're thinking you're going to go
[1:03:36] to pray and have everything answered i
[1:03:38] think we maybe get the home in order
[1:03:40] first
[1:03:40] and then you go to prayer when there's
[1:03:42] love and unity in that home
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:45] and you claim to be he says the son of
[1:03:47] god where's your principles if the woman
[1:03:49] ain't out of her place is out of her
[1:03:51] place aren't you a son of god the one
[1:03:53] that's and you're the one that's higher
[1:03:55] or stronger vessel as the bible says
[1:03:57] then you show yourself a man of god tell
[1:04:00] her he says sister you're wrong
[1:04:02] that's right i've done it another
[1:04:04] christian has done it and you'll always
[1:04:05] do it as long as you're a christian but
[1:04:07] show yourself you're a son of god you're
[1:04:09] having you'll have you have to have more
[1:04:11] power over yourself than the woman does
[1:04:13] if she's weaker recognize her to be that
[1:04:15] understand her mistakes and things and
[1:04:16] try to correct her sister we're
[1:04:18] christians we shouldn't do that be a
[1:04:20] real man a son of god and watch the
[1:04:23] woman
[1:04:26] that's your place men
[1:04:29] manliness
[1:04:30] courage and a courageous man is going to
[1:04:33] stand on truth on the word of god that's
[1:04:35] scripture and this message
[1:04:38] you don't be quiet
[1:04:40] can't be quiet
[1:04:42] these are our homes
[1:04:43] because if our homes are out of order
[1:04:46] then i would ask how is your prayers
[1:04:48] going if that home is out of order
[1:04:49] because here your prayer can be hindered
[1:04:52] when you're home giving don't giving the
[1:04:54] right honor in your home and not having
[1:04:55] having a fresh unity in your home god
[1:04:57] help us now to always be right online
[1:05:02] honor and respect your wife
[1:05:04] good woman is a jewel in a man's crown
[1:05:07] she should be honored but abram said
[1:05:10] amen
[1:05:11] he says but if they can respect what god
[1:05:13] made them a motherhood a real queen
[1:05:15] she's one of the best things god give a
[1:05:17] man was a wife besides salvation she's
[1:05:19] the best thing if she's a good wife my
[1:05:22] she's not there's other things scripture
[1:05:24] says about that but if you've got a good
[1:05:26] wife brother you ought to respect her
[1:05:28] with the highest
[1:05:31] lord help us
[1:05:33] lord forgive us
[1:05:35] all of us brothers that have wives and
[1:05:37] brothers that are going to have wives
[1:05:39] respect her with the highest because god
[1:05:41] esteems her right next to salvation
[1:05:47] we provide for her
[1:05:49] scripture says for a no man ever hated
[1:05:52] his own flesh but nourisheth and
[1:05:54] cherisheth it even as the lord the
[1:05:57] church amen
[1:05:59] but abraham says now if a man is sick he
[1:06:01] can't work and so forth he goes but if
[1:06:02] she's going out to work just to have a
[1:06:04] little extra money he says you better
[1:06:06] keep her away from that scallywag bunch
[1:06:08] is what he says he says her place
[1:06:09] there's in the home but he said he goes
[1:06:11] and mister you might call yourself ever
[1:06:12] so good but you've got lodges and other
[1:06:14] things that calls you away from her at
[1:06:16] night you ought to be ashamed of
[1:06:17] yourself god gave you a home to cherish
[1:06:20] and comfort and things like that he says
[1:06:23] it's a shame to see the way a man does
[1:06:24] their wives and wives do men womanhood
[1:06:26] fatherhood the nation is tore to pieces
[1:06:29] this is a prophet speaking to a nation
[1:06:31] saying lord i'm just saying to in our as
[1:06:33] a man as a courageous man of god his
[1:06:36] brothers our home that our scripture
[1:06:38] says to cherish and nourish and brother
[1:06:40] brahms talking about just going out and
[1:06:41] hey i got to go with the boys out here i
[1:06:43] got to do this right here i'll be out
[1:06:44] there later tonight and going one way
[1:06:46] and a wife going the other way that's
[1:06:47] wrong
[1:06:48] that's going to break your home down you
[1:06:51] be a man's man you you brought you took
[1:06:53] her to your side she's your help mate
[1:06:55] and you bring her close to you you
[1:06:57] nourish her you cherish her you build
[1:06:59] your home up in the admission of christ
[1:07:00] not going one way the other and that's
[1:07:02] what brother branham's talking about
[1:07:06] men of courage
[1:07:09] you're a protector
[1:07:11] daddy's husbands you're a protector
[1:07:14] sometimes brother brown says i preach
[1:07:16] pretty rough
[1:07:18] i see somebody getting out of line you
[1:07:20] see you're supposed to do that a real
[1:07:22] daddy will
[1:07:24] why he'd shake you and say here get back
[1:07:26] in line he's a real true father because
[1:07:29] he's a watchman of the home don't just
[1:07:32] let things go by daddies be like oh
[1:07:34] something just yeah well let's go let

[1:07:41] give me wisdom and discernment someone's
[1:07:43] trying to enter my home right here
[1:07:44] you're a watchman to protect your home
[1:07:49] sometimes your pastor has to weigh down
[1:07:51] something just love him that much more
[1:07:53] because he's a real father to you so
[1:07:54] what he's saying trying to keep you
[1:07:56] lined up my amen these are this is these
[1:07:59] are just aspects of scripture skimming
[1:08:02] through that makes a man a man of god to
[1:08:04] take care of his home and be a man of
[1:08:06] courage in this day i can tell you right
[1:08:08] now it takes a whole heaping load of
[1:08:10] courage to do all that in your home
[1:08:12] today
[1:08:14] it sure does brothers
[1:08:16] oh

[1:08:22] satan's fighting every aspect against it
[1:08:26] every aspect against it see well my god
[1:08:28] these are just pretty common scriptures
[1:08:30] you know we know all this yeah put into
[1:08:31] action

[1:08:34] story and you'll find though your home

[1:09:12] i'm not to be like a protector like a
[1:09:13] man how can i be courageous well
[1:09:16] you know the scripture says who can find
[1:09:22] you know that word virtuous
[1:09:25] it's actually
[1:09:26] the hebrew word there
[1:09:29] is the same word valor
[1:09:32] and strength actually army and battle
[1:09:36] that's where that word actually it's
[1:09:37] called actually called kail in hebrew
[1:09:40] and it's strength of mind well it means
[1:09:42] valor virtue and strength strength of
[1:09:44] mind and spirit that enables a person to
[1:09:46] encounter danger and firmness
[1:09:48] great courage in face of danger the
[1:09:51] qualities of a hero or heroine
[1:09:54] exceptional or heroic courage
[1:09:57] let me just go back there sorry it's
[1:09:58] speaking of a woman who can find a
[1:10:01] virtuous
[1:10:02] a woman that has valor that has virtue
[1:10:06] that has strength that is courageous
[1:10:08] like a heroine yes
[1:10:10] you can be a courageous woman in this
[1:10:13] day
[1:10:15] you're in the battle too
[1:10:17] this ain't just the brothers battle
[1:10:19] you're fighting as well
[1:10:21] you're fighting as well you're in the
[1:10:22] battle
[1:10:24] and my oh my if the brothers are under
[1:10:26] attack
[1:10:28] so are you big time
[1:10:31] big time to tear everything that god has
[1:10:34] put into a woman to the ground
[1:10:37] you're you're in battle
[1:10:40] perverted
[1:10:41] the whole
[1:10:43] whole woman is being perverted her role
[1:10:46] everything and i'd be careful as we've
[1:10:49] talked about truth what you're following
[1:10:52] what social media trend you're following
[1:10:54] what's influencing you to do a certain
[1:10:57] certain dress or a certain you know uh
[1:10:59] way you handle yourself or the way you
[1:11:01] communicate or what you're saying and
[1:11:02] what you're doing i'd be careful what
[1:11:04] truth you're following because it's
[1:11:05] taking away from who god has made you to
[1:11:08] be and gonna tear down from that
[1:11:10] virtuous woman of who you should be
[1:11:13] amen
[1:11:15] now
[1:11:17] just briefly david had brother bram says
[1:11:19] he had many wives and he's speaking he's
[1:11:21] speaking and choosing of a bride he's
[1:11:23] showing the type between god he was like
[1:11:25] the body of believers and is the bride
[1:11:26] of christ calls it she the woman he was
[1:11:29] the man christ now we were made for
[1:11:31] christ christ wasn't made for us we are
[1:11:34] the bride of christ we were made for him
[1:11:38] and bradham is typing he goes christ he
[1:11:40] goes that's what we're trying to do
[1:11:41] today in our textbooks is try to make
[1:11:43] the word which is christ suit us well
[1:11:46] you know and try to make the word make
[1:11:48] you know suit what i want to do and bend
[1:11:50] it to our own truth and he's saying
[1:11:52] that's not how it works we were made for
[1:11:54] him all right and so he's just saying
[1:11:57] that's that he goes instead of us trying
[1:11:59] to make ourselves suit the word that's
[1:12:00] the difference and so he's speaking
[1:12:02] about a woman that's made for her
[1:12:04] husband she's made for him amen
[1:12:08] but iran says in the time had come for
[1:12:10] abraham
[1:12:12] he says my got to decide i need a wife
[1:12:14] for my son isaac and he waited 25 years
[1:12:17] and he received him from the dead know
[1:12:18] that he was called and he said there was
[1:12:20] a time when he had to make the decision
[1:12:22] who would be his helpmate
[1:12:25] and here's what he said next
[1:12:27] for you sisters
[1:12:29] to carry on
[1:12:30] the plan
[1:12:32] of god
[1:12:34] you are a helpmate to carry on the plan
[1:12:37] of god in that son of god's world
[1:12:40] that's who you are this is no
[1:12:42] substandard position i don't do this
[1:12:45] that's it's the world that's trying to
[1:12:46] make men men high and women low or women
[1:12:48] high men low and all this garbage but
[1:12:50] god has put her beside of you man to be
[1:12:53] a help me to carry on the plan of god
[1:12:55] there ain't no lower aspect there that
[1:12:58] is right beside him as a help vessel so
[1:13:00] that he can actually get to the end
[1:13:02] without you he can't do it you're there
[1:13:04] to help and make the plan of god come to
[1:13:06] fruition
[1:13:09] not second rate and neither are you
[1:13:12] treated as such
[1:13:13] you're to help your husband and carry
[1:13:15] that plan of god amen just as christ
[1:13:17] bride must express and carry on his
[1:13:19] works
[1:13:20] he through us so that we can express him
[1:13:24] and fulfill his purpose here on earth
[1:13:25] that's exactly the spiritual type of the
[1:13:28] natural
[1:13:29] amen
[1:13:31] later brandon says
[1:13:32] my says i guess your sweetheart came to
[1:13:34] you speaking to your brother i feel i
[1:13:36] know you feel that way about her she's
[1:13:37] still your sweetheart and that's the way
[1:13:39] i know we all us christians feel about
[1:13:41] our wives or our sweethearts i hope that
[1:13:43] never changes in my family and never
[1:13:46] changes in your family that we can
[1:13:47] always feel that way after all they
[1:13:50] stand side by side with us to help us
[1:13:53] fight these battles
[1:13:57] so who's fighting together
[1:13:59] together
[1:14:00] men of courage and women of courage amen
[1:14:05] it's just about knowing your position
[1:14:07] and knowing where you need to be
[1:14:09] because in position you're a unified
[1:14:11] mighty army
[1:14:13] out of position
[1:14:16] ain't gonna work out
[1:14:18] you'll be constantly under battle and
[1:14:19] defeated
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:23] pure
[1:14:24] chaste modest meek quiet spirit
[1:14:27] first peter says wow they behold your
[1:14:29] chaste conversation coupled with fear
[1:14:31] this is a sister
[1:14:33] it continues on be let it be
[1:14:36] but let it be hidden the hidden man of
[1:14:38] the heart the inner realm the soul realm
[1:14:40] in that which is not corruptable even
[1:14:42] the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit
[1:14:44] which is in the sight of god a great
[1:14:46] price
[1:14:47] brother branham says oh i hate he goes
[1:14:49] oh he goes i hate the word he's talking
[1:14:51] about an actor he says some sisters do
[1:14:53] the same thing he goes a lot of acting
[1:14:54] oh they'll cut their husband's nose off
[1:14:56] with john why did you do that just as
[1:14:57] snappy as can be i'm just copying with
[1:15:00] brother branham
[1:15:02] exactly
[1:15:04] why didn't you do this why do you do
[1:15:05] that what is this what is that it just
[1:15:06] thumbs up some step
[1:15:08] and then he says you know the phone
[1:15:10] rings hello

[1:15:16] he says oh my

[1:15:20] women of courage that's not to be amen
[1:15:23] our homes that's not a strong home amen
[1:15:26] but this is just a little bit of
[1:15:27] bringing ourselves back in line if i
[1:15:29] want me to read the quote he says house
[1:15:30] angels and road devils
[1:15:33] that's what he says
[1:15:35] he says just be yourself all the time
[1:15:38] amen
[1:15:39] meek
[1:15:40] quiet humble amen contrite spirit amen
[1:15:43] motherhood she's a keeper of the home
[1:15:45] she's feminine she's in the beauty of
[1:15:47] holiness and god made you to be feminine

[1:15:53] and man he made you to be want to be
[1:15:55] pretty and a lady and all this garbage

[1:16:47] wholesome holy ghost filled and she'll
[1:16:49] lead your home all the way to rapture
[1:16:57] who can find a virtuous woman for a
[1:16:59] priceless farb of rubies
[1:17:01] and the heart of her husband does safely
[1:17:03] trust in her
[1:17:05] so that she'll have no need of spoil it
[1:17:07] is quite a scripture and i won't go
[1:17:09] through all of proverbs 31
[1:17:11] she opened with her mouth with wisdom
[1:17:13] and her tongue is the law of kindness my
[1:17:16] she looketh well into the ways of her
[1:17:18] household and eat us not the bread of
[1:17:19] idleness
[1:17:22] she's a doer
[1:17:23] if you read proverbs 31
[1:17:25] sisters
[1:17:27] that woman of
[1:17:28] virtue she's quite a
[1:17:31] mighty woman of valor

[1:17:39] there's a lot of doing a home
[1:17:40] it's a woman of virtue
[1:17:42] a woman of courage
[1:17:45] and her her children arise up and call
[1:17:48] her
[1:17:49] blessed
[1:17:50] and her husband also
[1:17:53] and he praises her
[1:17:56] what a woman this is this is you
[1:17:59] women of courage woman of valor
[1:18:04] like ruth
[1:18:05] who is willing to let it all go and turn
[1:18:07] her back
[1:18:08] that same word kail
[1:18:10] is used with ruth
[1:18:12] boaz says and now my daughter fear not i
[1:18:15] will do to thee all thou requires for
[1:18:16] all the city of my people doth know
[1:18:19] that thou art a virtuous woman that's
[1:18:22] the same word a woman of valor and
[1:18:25] strength
[1:18:26] a woman of courage that's what boaz was
[1:18:29] seeing in ruth that's what you young men
[1:18:31] would want to see in a young woman as
[1:18:33] boaz saw in ruth you are a woman of
[1:18:35] virtue
[1:18:36] you're a woman of valor
[1:18:38] why she had something deepened down i
[1:18:40] mean he had known what she had done she
[1:18:42] had left it all behind ruth had put it
[1:18:44] on the ground she had showed who she was
[1:18:46] hey man she was tried and true and
[1:18:48] tested my she said lord your god be my
[1:18:51] god i'm gonna if i if you where you die
[1:18:53] i'm gonna die i'm gonna be buried where
[1:18:55] you buried she was a woman of courage i
[1:18:57] could tell you that amen that's who you
[1:18:58] want to be like sisters i was looking at
[1:19:00] the scripture i was thinking a woman of
[1:19:02] courage my goodness and i
[1:19:04] came across my mind came across jl
[1:19:07] i think well now that's a woman of
[1:19:08] courage
[1:19:10] yes my goodness you know though i just i
[1:19:12] was thinking about it and here she was
[1:19:13] hearing the battle uh you know bear with
[1:19:15] me here she was just in hearing
[1:19:17] obviously the battle shoes from the
[1:19:18] kenites and israel they were if you go
[1:19:21] in the history of it she was you know
[1:19:23] they were
[1:19:24] kind of aligned with israel and it
[1:19:26] doesn't really say exactly you know if
[1:19:28] they serve the god but here she was
[1:19:30] outside of her tent and uh and jabin and
[1:19:33] hazor and and says sisera they were
[1:19:36] together and and so there was some
[1:19:38] cesaro basically felt that they were you
[1:19:40] know allies more or less so this is why
[1:19:42] he went to her tent he was running away
[1:19:44] because he was the last man standing in
[1:19:46] a battle where that he lost and so
[1:19:48] caesar is running running through the
[1:19:49] hills as fast as he can to escape and he
[1:19:51] comes across jl's tent
[1:19:53] and then here she is obviously outside
[1:19:55] and maybe she's looking maybe there's
[1:19:56] some israelites or something she can
[1:19:58] help i don't know why she's out there
[1:19:59] but she's looking for see what's going
[1:20:01] on because obviously she knew battle was
[1:20:02] happening and here he comes running up
[1:20:04] to her tent
[1:20:05] now this is a woman of courage
[1:20:08] this is a woman of courage
[1:20:10] and here she brings him into into her
[1:20:12] tent
[1:20:13] and
[1:20:13] feigns like everything's all well and
[1:20:15] fine who come into the tent and she
[1:20:17] gives him his his drink of
[1:20:20] milk uh instead of water and he lays
[1:20:23] down and she covers them with this with
[1:20:24] this with a mantle and here she was and
[1:20:27] now i just i was pondering this i said
[1:20:29] my goodness here she was oh pretty much
[1:20:32] luring the enemy
[1:20:34] into her household and saying all right
[1:20:36] i know exactly who you are you haven't
[1:20:38] you haven't you know
[1:20:40] fooled me and this is a woman of courage
[1:20:42] this is like a husband that is looking
[1:20:44] out for his home as a protector so does
[1:20:46] the mama so does a wife be looking out
[1:20:49] in her home saying that what's happening
[1:20:50] with johnny here susie and she could see
[1:20:53] okay i see where you're coming just she
[1:20:55] just gets to everything set up and
[1:20:56] figure them out get them all in the
[1:20:58] corner and there she goes gets them all
[1:21:00] set down and here was her enemy now now
[1:21:02] it's time to take courage and she takes
[1:21:04] a nail on a hammer and drives him
[1:21:06] through the brains and nails them to the
[1:21:08] floor
[1:21:09] that's some serious courage
[1:21:12] come on saints put yourself there
[1:21:14] dear goodness
[1:21:16] that was that took some serious nerve to
[1:21:19] do that but i tell you sisters that's
[1:21:21] the same nerve that god gives you he
[1:21:23] gives you that same courage you take it
[1:21:25] in your home and drive the nail through
[1:21:27] some demon that's trying to enter your
[1:21:29] home you'll be in jail you take god at
[1:21:32] his word that's exactly what you do
[1:21:33] don't be fooled you say all right i know
[1:21:35] where you're coming i can see what
[1:21:36] you're trying to do try to influence my
[1:21:38] daughter here and then take the word of
[1:21:40] god and nail him to the ground
[1:21:43] actually the scripture next says she
[1:21:45] nailed him and then she cut his head off
[1:21:47] yeah so she made sure
[1:21:49] like she needed to but she did
[1:21:53] my
[1:21:55] she needed some divine power to do that
[1:21:58] and so will you
[1:21:59] need divine courage to do what you need
[1:22:01] to do to take the enemy out amen
[1:22:05] oh i just can't i just can't even
[1:22:07] imagine that moment what if her hand
[1:22:09] shook her you know like so many things
[1:22:10] could have gone wrong
[1:22:12] so many things go wrong that's why you
[1:22:14] need discernment when you're dealing
[1:22:15] with this situation you say my so many
[1:22:17] things could go wrong what if i say the
[1:22:18] wrong thing here oh god help me say the
[1:22:20] right word help me help me say it in
[1:22:22] love and help me say that because so
[1:22:23] many things could spin off and cause
[1:22:25] some some bad reaction
[1:22:27] that's the natural that's the spiritual
[1:22:32] but she did it effectually
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:37] sisters satan's out to destroy
[1:22:40] true womanhood
[1:22:41] true motherhood
[1:22:43] nail her to the ground
[1:22:44] him to the ground amen
[1:22:47] and let truth march on
[1:22:49] my
[1:22:50] right we'll close up here
[1:22:53] courage it's not usually although what
[1:22:55] you always think as we've been saying
[1:22:56] you know we think this daring and brash
[1:22:58] boldness and such
[1:23:00] but you know brother branham says peter
[1:23:01] had a sword
[1:23:04] and he was going to cut the high
[1:23:05] priest's ear off
[1:23:07] but you know he goes when it come to
[1:23:08] real
[1:23:09] christian courage
[1:23:11] he didn't have it
[1:23:13] that's his words you're like
[1:23:15] peter didn't have real christian courage
[1:23:18] that's what dr branham said so don't get
[1:23:20] mad at me
[1:23:21] here he had a sword
[1:23:23] he backed up and denied him
[1:23:25] he cut the priest's ear off with his
[1:23:27] sword sure he knowed how to handle it
[1:23:29] but when it come to the squeeze
[1:23:31] and the time to stand on the word of god
[1:23:34] he didn't have the courage and even
[1:23:36] denied he'd know jesus
[1:23:38] oh
[1:23:39] when it came down to the squeeze
[1:23:42] where are we at saints of god when it
[1:23:44] come down to a squeeze to stand on the
[1:23:46] word of god he didn't have the courage
[1:23:50] my goodness he goes that's where it is
[1:23:52] today
[1:23:53] we got courage to build things and put
[1:23:55] millions of dollars here courage to put
[1:23:57] pipe organs and plush seats everything
[1:23:58] go out proselyte from place to place
[1:24:00] make a methodist come back and so forth
[1:24:02] back and forth like this but when it
[1:24:04] comes to christian courage accept the
[1:24:06] word the message of god and stand there
[1:24:09] on it we are few
[1:24:11] this is brother branham
[1:24:13] catch it but when it comes to christian
[1:24:16] courage accept the word
[1:24:18] the message of god and stand there on it
[1:24:21] it had nothing to do peter actually was
[1:24:23] trying to cut off an ear and protecting
[1:24:25] that action brother brown says that
[1:24:26] wasn't courage at all
[1:24:28] but it was recognizing the word being
[1:24:30] manifest in his day and standing there
[1:24:32] on it he ran away and denied it
[1:24:36] what uh what do we see as over these
[1:24:38] many years you say
[1:24:41] people go out oh but they were they once
[1:24:44] stood there
[1:24:45] cut it off
[1:24:46] no no but when the really when it came
[1:24:48] down to it they actually missed the
[1:24:49] manifestation of the word in our day
[1:24:52] that's true courage
[1:24:56] when it come down to real down inside of
[1:24:58] him courage he didn't have it speaking
[1:25:00] of peter still no he didn't have it when
[1:25:02] he seen the word now i'm going to get
[1:25:03] religious he said when he had seen that
[1:25:05] word made manifest and knowed that that
[1:25:08] was the day for it to be there and seen
[1:25:11] it proved exactly hello saints has that
[1:25:14] happened again in this day let's just
[1:25:15] put it to now and it proved exactly what
[1:25:18] god said it would do and then with all
[1:25:20] this intellectual strength with all his
[1:25:22] physical being and he just lets that
[1:25:24] trail off he goes that's the way it is
[1:25:26] today men who just walk up put their
[1:25:28] name on a book shake hands with the
[1:25:30] minister and when it comes to standing
[1:25:32] in the office and the boss passes a
[1:25:34] drink oh they'll take it because they're
[1:25:36] afraid of their job
[1:25:37] now it gets down into our everyday
[1:25:39] living the courage to stand on the word
[1:25:41] of god and here now he's just speaking
[1:25:43] about maybe maybe not really showing
[1:25:46] exactly having courage to stand on god's
[1:25:48] word and show that you are of a of a
[1:25:51] christian and god's field in your heart
[1:25:53] he's saying they're at work you know and
[1:25:55] he goes it comes to paying your tithe in
[1:25:56] church you're afraid to do it because
[1:25:57] you're afraid to starve to death even
[1:26:00] though god promised you to take care of
[1:26:01] you because all these things when you
[1:26:03] come to church and the holy spirit falls
[1:26:05] amongst the people and something in your
[1:26:07] heart says
[1:26:08] this is it that's the word
[1:26:10] he says when you see the baptism and
[1:26:12] everything brought out of the word and
[1:26:14] you're afraid to take it what's the
[1:26:16] matter
[1:26:17] he says you're lacking courage
[1:26:20] you're lacking spiritual courage
[1:26:22] to stand up
[1:26:24] that's
[1:26:25] real
[1:26:26] courage
[1:26:27] that's real courage is when you can see
[1:26:29] god moving and the word moving amongst
[1:26:31] us and you can say hey that's it that's
[1:26:33] the word but you're not able to actually
[1:26:38] step forward
[1:26:39] and take it
[1:26:41] he says that's lacking courage
[1:26:43] lord
[1:26:44] fill our hearts
[1:26:48] someone may be on that little edge there
[1:26:50] seeing god move seeing the testimonies
[1:26:53] of of god moving here brother mike and
[1:26:55] sister debbie the testimony just
[1:26:57] thrilled my heart to hear god move
[1:26:59] because i prayed i said oh god i'm
[1:27:00] expecting a testimony of see what you've
[1:27:03] done we put out many prayers and we're
[1:27:05] believing i'm expecting to hear tonight
[1:27:07] something you do in amongst us and
[1:27:09] brother mike and sister debbie's
[1:27:10] testimony came in the back room and said
[1:27:12] that's our god amen and that's the
[1:27:14] courage to actually say god's moving in
[1:27:16] our midst and that's that's what i want
[1:27:18] to stand for
[1:27:19] god give you courage amen true blue
[1:27:22] courage recognize the word as truth and
[1:27:25] stand up for it that's courage amen
[1:27:29] man brother daniel i just heard your
[1:27:30] amen good to see you
[1:27:34] you thought we would forgot that amen
[1:27:37] not happening god bless you amen as we
[1:27:40] close here
[1:27:41] brother braham says put the pull put the
[1:27:43] whole armor of god
[1:27:45] he says a believer on christ followed
[1:27:47] him hour by hour but he'd only seen the
[1:27:48] word by letter
[1:27:50] now he's taught this is now taking this
[1:27:51] quote of peter
[1:27:53] saying he didn't have courage
[1:27:55] didn't see the word when he saw the word
[1:27:56] manifest he'd and he didn't and he
[1:27:58] denied it but brother he says
[1:28:02] brother
[1:28:03] after pentecost
[1:28:06] after when god came down and filled his
[1:28:09] soul after something happened after they
[1:28:12] tarried and they waited day one day two
[1:28:14] day three day seven day nine day ten
[1:28:17] after that time he says oh my a believer
[1:28:21] on christ followed him by hour by hour
[1:28:23] but he'd only seen the word by letter
[1:28:24] then he'd only seen it manifested but
[1:28:26] now it was in him
[1:28:29] now it was in him it wasn't just before
[1:28:31] him watching it happen but something
[1:28:33] happened when the new birth strikes your
[1:28:35] soul and the power of god falls in now
[1:28:37] it's inside you amen he said the word of
[1:28:40] god fiery word burning his own flesh
[1:28:43] amen you didn't have to worry about
[1:28:44] whether you had courage or not because
[1:28:46] when the moment came and they busted out
[1:28:48] them doors you bet peter had courage all
[1:28:50] with the them 11 and he started
[1:28:52] preaching forth the gospel and here we
[1:28:54] stand on acts 2 38 because of his sermon
[1:28:56] that he came because god did something
[1:28:59] my goodness a denier at one time but a
[1:29:01] spiritual man of courage after god got a
[1:29:04] hold of his heart amen
[1:29:08] yes sir when it comes to part of you
[1:29:11] something changes
[1:29:13] something changes
[1:29:17] i'm going to close here because if i
[1:29:19] don't
[1:29:20] i'll keep a few more pages so musicians
[1:29:22] why don't you come now
[1:29:24] you know it takes courage to accept
[1:29:26] christ
[1:29:28] it takes courage to accept christ
[1:29:32] i wonder how many have
[1:29:34] right been on that edge over the many
[1:29:36] many years and just couldn't
[1:29:39] couldn't make that step
[1:29:41] and as butterburn says they see it and
[1:29:43] they see the word manifest
[1:29:45] but they can't come into an experience
[1:29:47] and stand for and say god that's what i
[1:29:49] want
[1:29:50] and then be like a peter who's now
[1:29:52] burning from the inside out
[1:29:54] he says brother brown says well
[1:29:56] he says would there be in this divine
[1:29:58] presence some sinner that would say i
[1:29:59] want to love him brother branham truly i
[1:30:01] do
[1:30:03] i've always
[1:30:04] wanted to
[1:30:05] i wish i had the courage
[1:30:08] tonight to receive him as my savior he
[1:30:10] says wouldn't you raise your hand
[1:30:12] he says another quote he goes oh he goes
[1:30:14] it took courage
[1:30:16] to raise that hand
[1:30:18] my
[1:30:19] he said lord
[1:30:22] he says god be merciful to me say as you
[1:30:24] raise your hand i believe
[1:30:26] i believe the holy spirit led me god
[1:30:27] bless you sir that might have took a lot
[1:30:30] of courage to do that but it's the
[1:30:33] greatest
[1:30:34] thing
[1:30:35] you ever done
[1:30:41] i don't know where i don't know where
[1:30:43] this is just a little bit of a
[1:30:45] wrap up service on
[1:30:46] truth and the courage to stand for it
[1:30:49] but i'm praying tonight i've just been
[1:30:51] so burdened
[1:30:52] in my heart just seeing what god has
[1:30:54] what god has been doing amongst the
[1:30:56] people
[1:30:57] whether it be in
[1:30:59] charging our faith
[1:31:00] to
[1:31:01] for healing for the needs in our body or
[1:31:04] whether it just be to see just people
[1:31:05] growing cool and
[1:31:07] falling away or whichever he said lord
[1:31:09] would you just instill a new
[1:31:11] found level of spiritual courage that we
[1:31:14] could stay in our places our women will
[1:31:16] be women our men will be men of god and
[1:31:19] we'll stand and accept the word for this
[1:31:21] day and we are not going to step out of
[1:31:24] that and we're going to take you at your
[1:31:26] word and if there's some little prick in
[1:31:28] your heart lord would be drop courage
[1:31:30] into your heart you say lord
[1:31:33] i want that
[1:31:34] and if it just takes a little sometimes
[1:31:36] it just takes a little push to really
[1:31:39] just to step over that little edge and
[1:31:41] say lord i need you
[1:31:43] i want give me the courage tonight just
[1:31:45] to say lord i want you as my savior
[1:31:49] i want you as my savior
[1:31:51] you know i was i pondered
[1:31:53] that as we just close
[1:31:55] and you can have all sometimes the
[1:31:57] hardest thing to do
[1:31:59] is to wait
[1:32:01] and i thought i had just the next little
[1:32:03] part was the courage to wait
[1:32:06] because scripture says they that wait
[1:32:07] upon the lord shall renew their strength
[1:32:10] and sometimes we're waiting in this time
[1:32:12] as god has moved and he's dealt and
[1:32:14] you've anchored some faith down and
[1:32:15] you've made a move and you're just
[1:32:16] waiting and you're sitting that time and
[1:32:19] it's hard to wait
[1:32:21] humans don't like to wait
[1:32:23] saying lord i'm needing you i i've put
[1:32:25] something out there
[1:32:26] and i've prayed for it
[1:32:29] and i said lord give us courage
[1:32:31] now to wait
[1:32:33] as you wait on him
[1:32:35] and you know we people they have a hard
[1:32:36] time waiting because it's unknown
[1:32:38] something's known in the future
[1:32:40] and so they get unsettled
[1:32:42] but we are not in an unknown
[1:32:44] the promise has been given we know what
[1:32:46] the we know what the promise says
[1:32:48] that you believed on whether it's
[1:32:50] healing whether it's a son or daughter
[1:32:52] whether whatever the need is the promise
[1:32:55] is true
[1:32:56] we went through that and this is the
[1:32:58] word is true and so there's no unknown
[1:33:00] so in our waiting we can be settled and
[1:33:03] we wait on him and we keep our eyes
[1:33:06] focused on him not on the circumstance
[1:33:08] and so therefore then our faith actually
[1:33:10] as the scripture says they that wait on
[1:33:13] the lord
[1:33:14] shall renew
[1:33:16] their strength and so your strength and
[1:33:18] your courage in that time doesn't
[1:33:20] actually wane it doesn't actually
[1:33:22] diminish as you're like well lord i'm
[1:33:24] waiting it actually gets renewed every
[1:33:27] day as you wait on him as you pray as
[1:33:30] you seek his face as as you lay it at
[1:33:32] his feet say lord i'm trusting in you
[1:33:33] and so as you wait on him your strength
[1:33:36] is renewed daily amen that's what the
[1:33:38] scripture says they shall mount up with
[1:33:41] wings as he goes they shall run and not
[1:33:43] be weary they shall walk and not faint
[1:33:46] but it's they that wait upon the lord
[1:33:49] renews their courage it renews that
[1:33:51] strength within them and so lord as we
[1:33:54] are in these times as the lord has been
[1:33:56] moving and we've been putting our hands
[1:33:58] on what god is saying maybe an anchor a
[1:34:00] promise or something that you've done
[1:34:01] you just said lord that's for me i laid
[1:34:04] it down on that service there i put a
[1:34:06] stake down there on that service there i
[1:34:07] say have courage
[1:34:09] and now wait
[1:34:11] have courage and wait on him because in
[1:34:14] his time
[1:34:15] it will come to pass
[1:34:16] amen let's stand
[1:34:26] i was thinking of a
[1:34:29] in battle
[1:34:31] when they would put the line
[1:34:34] and they'd have a lineup of battle
[1:34:36] and you'd be on the front lines and the
[1:34:38] the soldiers would be coming at you
[1:34:41] and then the general would be saying
[1:34:43] just wait
[1:34:44] just hold you'd be more like yelling it
[1:34:47] hold
[1:34:48] just just there was a moment when there
[1:34:51] was a go time there's a moment the right
[1:34:54] moment for the strategy to come to full
[1:34:56] effect
[1:34:57] for for exactly what the general wanted
[1:35:00] to happen and so he's just saying wait
[1:35:02] hold and you could be in there and
[1:35:03] you're just like the enemy's coming
[1:35:04] right at you it's almost like he's
[1:35:06] breathing on you and he's saying just
[1:35:08] hold
[1:35:10] it's when he says
[1:35:12] and when he says go
[1:35:14] then the army let loose and then then
[1:35:17] the victory or the battle was engaged
[1:35:20] wait for his time
[1:35:22] wait for his
[1:35:23] go
[1:35:24] god sets that in your heart he's got the
[1:35:26] exact timing and maybe it just might be
[1:35:28] a little maybe it's just now you feel
[1:35:30] like you're just in that hole there's a
[1:35:32] general saying just hold just wait say
[1:35:34] lord give me the courage to hold that
[1:35:36] line as i see the enemy coming but i'm
[1:35:38] holding my line i ain't moving i ain't
[1:35:40] stepping aside ain't getting all jittery
[1:35:42] i don't know what's going on here no
[1:35:43] just hold the line he knows what's going
[1:35:46] on stay in position we don't need ranks
[1:35:48] to be um i'm scared what's going on if
[1:35:50] this person goes off that person hold
[1:35:53] the line have courage as you wait he's
[1:35:56] the general
[1:35:57] we're just standing there frontlining
[1:35:59] ready with our armor ready for that
[1:36:01] moment because when he says go
[1:36:03] go
[1:36:04] then we'll then we'll engage in battle
[1:36:07] and the victor will be one because he's
[1:36:09] the general not any of us amen
[1:36:12] i want to sing tonight
[1:36:15] fourth man in the fire
[1:36:17] so you're gonna have to help me
[1:36:19] so you're gonna have to find another

[1:36:41] bow
