[0:55] Jesus said, "If I be lifted up,
[1:03] I will surely draw men unto me."
[1:12] So as Moses raised the serpent
[1:16] in the wilderness,
[1:21] so high and lifted up must Jesus be.

[1:30] Highly lifted up.
[1:38] He was hiding
[1:42] for all to see.

[1:50] God and forever.
[1:55] Oh,
[1:57] highly
[2:00] on Calary.
[2:06] See him on the cross. his eyes of
[2:13] looking down on all who stood and
[2:18] watched his shame.
[2:22] As they walked him and they searched
[2:26] him, God turned his eyes away.
[2:32] Oh, I lift it up.
[2:39] He was high.
[2:48] He was high
[2:52] for
[2:54] to see.
[2:57] He was resigned

[3:02] forever.
[3:07] I lift it up on Calary.
[3:15] Well, Jesus said, "I'll surely come
[3:20] again."
[3:23] That wherever I
[3:28] you will be near.
[3:32] Oh, I'm looking for the heavens
[3:37] up to the eastern sky.
[3:41] Where I lifted up, he shall appear.

[3:50] I lift him up in all his glory.
[3:57] Oh, he is my
[4:02] hero.

[12:08] [Music]
[12:12] I'm going ask brother Tom Frey, Brother
[12:13] Tom, if you'd come and open the service
[12:15] in a word of prayer.
[12:21] Sister Carmemella is requesting prayer
[12:22] for healing for sister-in-law has been
[12:25] diagnosed with cancer of the liver. The
[12:28] doctor said there's nothing more they
[12:29] can do. We want to remember her this
[12:32] morning. We want to remember the Jeffre
[12:34] family. Brotherh Wes Ardel's
[12:36] father-in-law uh passed away. Um
[12:40] and so uh we want to remember the
[12:43] family.
[12:44] Man, if you've got a need this morning,
[12:46] whatever it would be, just lift before
[12:48] the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. Tom,
[12:51] if you'd come,
[12:57] let's bow our heads, please.
[13:01] Most precious and heavenly father, Lord,
[13:03] we are so thankful, Lord, that we can be
[13:06] in the house of God tonight,
[13:08] Lord. We're just encouraged by one
[13:10] another's presence, oh God, as we lift
[13:13] our hands to you today, Lord, as we
[13:15] worship you, Lord. Thankful, oh God, to
[13:18] see those that are in the assembly,
[13:20] Lord. Lifting their hands and praising
[13:22] you, Lord, encouraged by it, oh God,
[13:24] knowing that there's a victory, Lord.
[13:26] That, Father, doesn't come from outward
[13:28] signs. It doesn't come from material
[13:31] things, but a victory, Lord, that you
[13:33] purchased, that you paid for, oh God.
[13:35] That Lord, maybe our human eyes may not
[13:38] grasp it. Our human intellect, oh God,
[13:40] can't understand it. But, Father, in in
[13:43] the word of God, it's been provided. And
[13:45] in the sacrifice you gave, Lord, and
[13:48] Father, we have the the not just the
[13:51] right, Lord, but the privilege to come
[13:53] before you this morning. An honor, oh
[13:55] God, to bring needs before you, oh God.
[13:58] That Lord, very, very needful things, oh
[14:02] God, upon the hearts of believers here
[14:04] in this room, oh God, and those that
[14:06] were penned. or sister Carmela's
[14:09] sister-in-law, I believe it is, oh God,
[14:11] who's been diagnosed with cancer, Lord,
[14:14] who the doctors have given up, oh God.
[14:16] And how many times has the prophet of
[14:18] God said over the tapes, Lord, that the
[14:21] doctors gave you up, but Lord, you never
[14:23] gave us up. And Lord, there's there is
[14:26] one amongst a thousand here, Lord, that
[14:29] that can mediate for us, that can take
[14:31] these needs before your throne, oh God,
[14:33] that can apply a token and can believe
[14:36] for, Lord, that which is impossible to
[14:38] man. And so, Lord, we claim, Lord, not
[14:42] just only this cancer case, but other
[14:44] cancer cases that are upon our hearts,
[14:46] Lord, other needs, oh God, that are upon
[14:48] our hearts. we claim in Jesus Christ's
[14:50] name, Lord, that the token that you have
[14:53] given us, oh God, we're applying it. And
[14:56] Lord, if there's anything that would
[14:57] hinder that token, oh God, into our own
[14:59] lives, anything, Lord, that would hinder
[15:02] the prayer of the saints in this room,
[15:04] Lord, we place that under the blood of
[15:06] Jesus Christ. And we ask Lord that you
[15:08] would take those things that Father we
[15:10] may have struggled with and those sins
[15:13] and the the weight that so easily besets
[15:15] us and we place that under that token
[15:17] blood Lord that nothing would hinder the
[15:19] prayer of the saints. Oh God to receive
[15:21] compassion for those that Lord the world
[15:24] has said there's no hope. And Lord, for
[15:26] our our brother Jeffy's family, Lord,
[15:29] our brother Wes's father-in-law who's
[15:31] passed away, Lord, and and any and all
[15:33] who are connected with that family,
[15:35] Lord. We pray for them today, Lord.
[15:38] Father God, we know that, Lord, in the
[15:40] flesh, it is a a very sad time, but in
[15:43] the spirit of Christ, Lord, what better
[15:46] reward could we know than to know a
[15:48] saint has gone on to meet you, Lord. And
[15:51] Lord, how that Lord one day that's our
[15:53] goal that we would meet you in your
[15:55] glory and Lord in a new body and Lord we
[15:58] know that our brother Jeff Lord is is on
[16:01] the other side but Lord Jesus their
[16:04] family members who are on this side oh
[16:05] God and we pray your compassion upon
[16:07] them Lord Father you're not m you're not
[16:10] unforgetful of them Lord you're mindful
[16:12] of Lord the families and and those that
[16:15] are left behind and you've given a
[16:16] comforter oh God and we just thank you
[16:19] for that Lord and ask that you be with
[16:20] that family, Lord. Lord, for the man of
[16:23] God that'll come behind this desk, Lord.
[16:26] There's many in this room who have
[16:27] prayed for him, Lord. And Lord, he
[16:30] himself has waited upon you into the wee
[16:32] hours of the morning and up early. And
[16:35] we pray, oh God, that the same God that
[16:37] met him before, Lord, and has been
[16:39] behind this pulpit before will come once
[16:41] again and speak to the people, Lord,
[16:43] from the vessel behind this pulpit. That
[16:45] Lord, if our eyes are on a man, Lord, we
[16:48] know that we've missed it. If our eyes
[16:50] are on words or things that are Lord
[16:52] just really nice sayings, Lord, we've
[16:54] missed it. But Lord God, may we go
[16:56] behind those things and go right down to
[16:58] the heart of the matter. Oh God, as our
[16:59] our brother would come, may he have the
[17:02] full freedom of the Holy Ghost to say
[17:04] what needs to be said and that we would
[17:06] hear what needs to be heard, Lord. And
[17:08] not only just with our ears, but with
[17:10] our lives. Live it, Lord. That we would
[17:12] be transformed and changed from the very
[17:14] eldest of us to the very youngest, oh
[17:16] God. that we would be ready for a
[17:18] rapture. Cuz Lord, the the times are
[17:21] changed. Lord, they're not just
[17:23] changing, they're changed, Lord. The
[17:25] things that are going on are happening
[17:26] so quick that we can't even keep up with
[17:28] them, Lord. In fact, Lord, may we just
[17:31] lay those things aside this morning and
[17:33] look to you now and ask, oh God, what
[17:36] would you have us to do? And what do you
[17:38] desire of us? And may you speak, Lord,
[17:40] in that manner to have your freedom
[17:42] behind this pulpit and with these people
[17:44] in Jesus name. Amen.
[17:49] [Music]
[17:53] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[18:06] Got a couple of announcements and
[18:07] brother Derek Paris has a song for us.
[18:09] Brother Derek, why don't you come and
[18:10] get ready? Uh at this time um we want to
[18:15] take a moment to welcome all those who
[18:17] are visiting with us and uh some from
[18:19] locally. I understand we got a visitor
[18:21] from Simon Fraser University uh Prosper
[18:24] Philistine. We're happy to have you here
[18:27] this morning. Any others locally that
[18:28] are uh from our area. We just are really
[18:31] happy to have you here. And as well we
[18:33] want a special welcome for some uh some
[18:36] folks from out of town. Take a moment
[18:39] just to welcome them. Um,
[18:42] we have uh, Brother Hank, Sister Daniel
[18:44] Iverson who are with us from Belgium.
[18:46] Why don't you stand up? We can welcome
[18:50] you. Amen. God bless you. Good to have
[18:52] you here.
[18:54] And also from Malaysia, Brother Jesse
[18:57] and Sister Janice. Get you to stand up,
[19:00] man. We're happy to have you here.
[19:04] Um
[19:07] there is a senior choir practice at 3:00
[19:11] this afternoon here at the church. And
[19:14] also uh an important announcement. We
[19:17] have uh a new member in the church here.
[19:21] Uh brother Marcus and Sister Anne Zeller
[19:23] are thankful to announce the arrival of
[19:25] their baby girl. born last Friday at
[19:28] 4:26 p.m. 6 pounds 12 ounces, 18 and a
[19:33] half inches tall
[19:35] &gt;&gt; if she was standing up.
[19:38] They're all doing well and they're
[19:39] thankful for that. And uh also an
[19:42] announcement from the school. Um most of
[19:45] you know that in less than two weeks the
[19:48] Y brothers are going to be here to uh
[19:50] sing us happy. Um, and for those who
[19:54] don't know, we just wanted to kind of
[19:55] make sure that everybody knew who they
[19:57] they are. Uh, these brothers are
[19:59] believers that have been in the message
[20:00] for many years. They attend brother
[20:02] Donnie Reagan's church. Uh, uh, and they
[20:05] sing, uh, with the Happy Valley song
[20:07] leader, uh, Brother Louie Blevens, uh,
[20:10] who's another wonderful believer. Um,
[20:12] the An brothers have written dozens of
[20:14] songs, uh, including one that we sing
[20:18] here all the time. All is well. Heard
[20:20] the message shalom. All is well. Uh
[20:22] they're very excited to be coming here
[20:24] to the church. It's been one of their
[20:25] lifelong dreams to come here and
[20:27] minister in song. And they're going to
[20:29] be singing some of their old favorites
[20:31] as well as some new songs, including one
[20:32] they just finished writing. And the
[20:34] school Bible uh Bible Way Christian
[20:37] Academy is sponsoring them, but uh
[20:40] sponsoring the Y brothers to come up,
[20:42] but they're so excited they're bringing
[20:43] their own brothers who play the piano
[20:45] and the steel guitar and um to to play
[20:48] with them. Brother Wes Ardel's coming
[20:50] out with them as well to be the master
[20:52] of ceremonies. He's going to be singing
[20:54] some of his own songs as well as singing
[20:55] with the Y brothers and they are good
[20:58] friends and often sing together in
[20:59] Tennessee. Uh people have asked
[21:01] questions how loud it's going to be.
[21:03] It's just going to be like here in the
[21:04] service. Um and I really think I'm going
[21:07] to be there. I think everybody if you
[21:09] like music but you don't like music,
[21:12] there's something wrong with you.
[21:18] Sorry, but there is
[21:21] &gt;&gt; cuz there's going to be singing in
[21:22] heaven.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Okay, we know that.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; And so so you know, one way to learn how
[21:30] to enjoy music is to listen to it. So uh
[21:33] I think uh um this is definitely going
[21:37] to be a once in a-lifetime event. They
[21:39] can't have it here at the church uh
[21:41] because it's a fundraiser. So, they're
[21:43] having it at a at a at an auditorium,
[21:45] but uh we're going to have church there,
[21:47] I'm sure. And so, come and be prepared
[21:50] to praise God. And, uh and um the
[21:53] seating is preassigned, so the sooner
[21:55] you sign up, the better seat you'll get.
[21:57] So, um enough said on that.
[22:04] The jerk.
[22:08] Amen. God bless you, saints. It's good
[22:10] to be here this morning. Uh this is a
[22:12] song that I heard uh three or four years
[22:14] ago written by a believer down in
[22:16] Trinidad. And at the time I heard it, it
[22:19] was very meaningful to me, but when
[22:21] David got sick, it meant a whole lot
[22:23] more. The title of the song is called
[22:26] The Dove Flew into my heart. And the
[22:28] inspiration comes from the message
[22:29] Brother Brandham preached in uh November
[22:32] of 1965 on the wings of a snow white
[22:34] dove. So I hope I'm not too nervous.
[22:37] This is a whole lot different than
[22:39] leading songs because you can help me
[22:40] when I lead songs. So, I trust it's a
[22:43] blessing to you this morning.
[22:49] [Music]
[23:08] I may be sick,
[23:10] but I keep on believing.
[23:18] I know that I'll be healed in Jesus
[23:22] name.
[23:26] The devil tries to rob me from
[23:31] my inheritance
[23:35] and the blessings
[23:38] the Lord has promised.
[23:45] I look at my lion vanities and say
[23:51] [Applause]
[23:54] I'm going to walk into my victory.
[24:00] [Applause]
[24:02] The dove flew into my heart. I know that
[24:07] he did.
[24:11] He has led me through the storm. I
[24:15] firmly believe
[24:20] the Lord has raised me up so high to
[24:24] believe what he has done
[24:27] for me.
[24:29] I'm an eagle
[24:31] to soar above the troubled waters.
[24:36] He has fluttered his wings in my heart.
[24:45] [Music]
[24:47] The dove flew into my heart. I firmly
[24:51] believe
[24:56] the dove flew into my heart. I know that
[25:00] he did.
[25:04] I may be troubled,
[25:07] confused,
[25:09] and shattered.
[25:13] I may be scarred, but I'll never
[25:18] give up.
[25:22] For he has promised
[25:25] deliverance from all my bondage.
[25:31] He wouldn't
[25:34] deny what he has promised.
[25:41] Jesus has provided
[25:44] all my needs.
[25:49] Whenever I call
[25:53] on his name,
[25:55] [Music]
[25:57] the dove flew into my heart. I know that
[26:02] he did.
[26:06] He has led me through the storm. I
[26:10] firmly believe
[26:14] the Lord has raised me up so high to
[26:18] believe what he has done
[26:21] for me.
[26:24] I'm an eagle
[26:26] to soar above the troubled waters.
[26:31] He has fluted his wings in my arms.
[26:41] The dove flew into my heart. I firmly
[26:45] believe
[26:49] the dove flew into my heart. I know that
[26:54] he did.
[26:58] The dove flew into my heart. I know that
[27:03] he did.
[27:04] [Music]
[27:06] He has led me through the storm. I
[27:11] firmly believe
[27:15] the Lord has raised me up so high to
[27:19] believe what he has done
[27:22] for me.
[27:24] I'm an eagle
[27:26] to soar above the troubled waters.
[27:31] He has fluttered his wings in my heart.
[27:41] The dove flew into my heart. I firmly
[27:46] believe.
[27:50] The dove flew into my heart. I know that
[27:54] he did.
[27:58] The dove flew into my heart. I firmly
[28:03] believe
[28:10] the dove flew into my heart.
[28:16] I know that he did.
[28:19] [Music]
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Derek's wonderful
[28:30] song.
[28:33] We've got a baby dedication at this
[28:35] time. Actually, two. Um, Brother Toby
[28:38] and Sister Rebecca Caillumbi.
[28:42] And, uh, I'm going to have their little
[28:43] one dedicated. Maybe they could come up
[28:45] at this time as well. Uh, John and Sarah
[28:48] Bergen dedicate their little guy.
[28:53] So, if you could come up at this time.
[28:54] Let's sing together. Jesus loves me.
[28:55] This I know. For the Bible tells me so.
[29:02] Jesus
[29:03] loves me this
[29:07] [Music]
[29:11] tells me so
[29:15] much to him
[29:20] they are weak but he is strong
[29:27] Jesus
[29:29] loves me. Yes, Jesus
[29:34] loves me.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus loves me.
[29:42] The Bible
[29:44] tells me so.
[29:47] Oh yes,
[29:50] Jesus
[29:51] loves me.
[29:55] Jesus loves me.
[30:00] Yes,
[30:01] Jesus loves me.
[30:05] The
[30:07] tells me so.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; That song actually has maybe a little
[30:15] bit more meaning to me than you this
[30:17] morning.
[30:20] I was the proverbial drop them off at
[30:23] Sunday school and parents go home. And
[30:26] so I learned that song myself
[30:30] and I love that little song.
[30:33] But this morning we have a baby
[30:35] dedication
[30:37] of two wonderful couples that not only
[30:40] are sending their children to church.
[30:44] They're bringing them as a family. And
[30:47] that is wonderful. And God bless you,
[30:50] brother Jonathan, Sister Sarah, Brother
[30:52] Toby, Sister Rebecca.
[30:55] We'll take this little time to give God
[30:58] honor this morning
[31:00] for what we believe.
[31:02] I was asked the question one time, "What
[31:05] do you believe?"
[31:07] And I didn't give them a doctrine. I
[31:09] just showed them some lies.
[31:12] This is what I believe.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; This is what I believe.
[31:21] This is what I believe. This is what the
[31:23] message produces.
[31:25] This is what the word does.
[31:28] And you should give God the praise for
[31:30] that.
[31:32] Young couples,
[31:34] the only desire they got as young men
[31:36] want to serve God with all their hearts.
[31:39] And young ladies that God has blessed
[31:40] them with godly husbands and beautiful
[31:43] children. These are divine gifts from
[31:46] God. And we thank the Lord so much for
[31:49] them this morning.
[31:53] We're in an Exodus hour and we have used
[31:56] the scripture often out of Exodus 12
[31:59] where it was commanded that Moses speak
[32:01] to the children of Israel.
[32:04] A lamb for a house.
[32:07] And we believe in the token of that lamb
[32:11] for the house, for its protection, for
[32:13] its blessing,
[32:15] for its keeping power, for its
[32:17] deliverance. We have believed that. And
[32:21] because of the token not just of to uh
[32:24] Jonathan's life and Toby's life, but
[32:26] because of their parents,
[32:29] they have godly parents.
[32:32] Parents that have gone through hard
[32:34] times, rough times for the word's sake,
[32:37] a token in their lives. And God has
[32:40] given them children. And now their
[32:43] children are bearing forth children.
[32:46] This is the blessing of the token. And
[32:48] we're thankful to the Lord for that
[32:51] &gt;&gt; and we bless his name.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; We have Max Jesse Bergen.
[32:59] I thought, man, what a handle.
[33:04] But if you've ever heard Jonathan sing,
[33:06] it's to the max.
[33:13] It's all right.
[33:17] Max means great or greatest.
[33:21] Jesse means gift but not only gift but
[33:24] it's a gift I possess.
[33:27] You put them together you can say the
[33:29] greatest gift I possess is life and life
[33:32] eternal and that is Christ and to God be
[33:35] the glory. Great things he has done.
[33:39] Brother Bram said this and this
[33:40] afternoon I want to speak on the
[33:42] greatest gift in the Bible. How many in
[33:45] the audience this afternoon could think
[33:47] of any greater gift than God would give
[33:49] to man eternal life? There is not one
[33:52] gift that could be given that's greater
[33:54] than life. It's sublime. It's a gift.
[33:58] And we can say Max Jesse, it's the
[34:01] greatest gift that I possess
[34:05] is life. It's a testimony, brother
[34:07] Jonathan, of what I believe is Jesus
[34:10] Christ. Sister Sarah, what's the
[34:11] greatest in your life is this one that's
[34:14] brought you together and given you a
[34:17] wonderful, wonderful gift from God. God
[34:20] so loved the world that he gave his only
[34:22] begotten son. What a gift. The greatest
[34:25] gift he could give, salvation. The next
[34:28] greatest gift is a godly wife. The next
[34:31] gift is what they're cradling within
[34:34] their arms. I say God is great
[34:38] &gt;&gt; to the max,
[34:40] the greatest.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; But it's not just something they've put
[34:44] Jesse to it. I possess. It's a claim and
[34:48] it's a declaration. To God be the glory
[34:52] for the gift that I possess. May God's
[34:55] hand ever be on Max
[34:59] Jesse's
[35:00] life. And beside them, another trophy.
[35:04] We have brother Toby and sister Rebecca,
[35:07] parents also that have stood for the
[35:09] gospel and now they see their children
[35:11] standing here with another gift. I say
[35:14] there's power not only in the blood,
[35:16] there's power in the token,
[35:19] &gt;&gt; power to deliver, power to give love,
[35:22] power to give life, power to give a
[35:25] desire for the things of God. And if you
[35:28] ever spend any moments with brother Toby
[35:30] and sister Rebecca, you don't have to
[35:32] spend too much time in their living room
[35:33] and you realize that they have a love
[35:35] for the things of God.
[35:38] Joel,
[35:41] what a joy it is, brother Toby, to be
[35:44] given a gift such as your little
[35:46] daughter,
[35:48] Joel. Abeni.
[35:51] Joel.
[35:53] Jehovah is God. Abeni
[35:57] We prayed and God answered.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; What a time it is.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; They took time and Jesus blessed them.
[36:08] Lord, would you bless these children?
[36:10] We've got parents giving testimony of
[36:13] the greatest gift. And another Joel,
[36:18] God, you're God. Jehovah, your God. But
[36:21] I've prayed and you've answered. And if
[36:23] you want to take the time into Psalms
[36:25] where David cried out in Psalms 118
[36:28] and5, Psalms 40 and1, Psalms 107 and13,
[36:32] Psalms 130 and2, 1st Samuel 23, and
[36:36] David inquired of the Lord again and God
[36:39] answered him.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; I say these are parents that have got a
[36:44] connection with God.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; They don't just send their children to
[36:48] church.
[36:50] They come as a family to church. May God
[36:56] bless these little ones this morning.
[36:58] Let's pray.
[37:08] Amen. Not too many years ago, I was
[37:11] doing this with Jonathan.
[37:16] I blessed man to be able to stand on
[37:19] here this morning.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[37:25] Love gifts
[37:28] &gt;&gt; given by God to special couples.
[37:32] They've sought your face. They've walked
[37:35] with God.
[37:37] You brought them together, Lord. You've
[37:40] led Jonathan and Sister Sarah.
[37:43] You blessed their parents.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Now you blessed their home.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; I hold in my arms,
[37:51] Max, Jesse. Lord,
[37:54] &gt;&gt; pray God that you'll ever keep your
[37:56] divine presence upon this child. And may
[37:59] he live life to its fullest, to its
[38:01] maximum.
[38:03] Lord in Christ, this greatest gift that
[38:06] you are.
[38:08] Lord, may he have such joy. May he bring
[38:10] it to mommy and daddy's heart. Lord, may
[38:13] he learn of you at a tender and young
[38:16] age if you should terry.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; May father God, you bless this child in
[38:22] a special way.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; We dedicate him this morning to you
[38:25] saying, Lord, here's a gift you've
[38:27] given. We give back. We ask God now that
[38:31] your greatest blessing rest upon this
[38:32] child. As Jonathan's always had a song
[38:35] in his soul.
[38:37] Time should terry, you should terry. May
[38:41] also this little gift. Lord bless others
[38:44] with a song in his soul for the glory of
[38:47] God. We pray in Jesus name.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you John.
[38:56] God bless you.
[39:04] Aren't they darling?
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, girls.
[39:11] Amen. Let's pray.
[39:15] Truly, Lord God,
[39:18] as a prophet has declared, Jehovah of
[39:20] the old is Jesus of the new. What a
[39:24] testimony it is that a mother and father
[39:27] stand here this morning, Lord, wanting
[39:29] to dedicate their little daughter, their
[39:31] little gift back to you. And that's what
[39:33] we're doing.
[39:35] Father, I'm so thankful that they are
[39:37] parents that have communion with God.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, they've asked. Not only is it
[39:44] asked, but you have answered.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; You have blessed their lives. Bless it
[39:48] again, I pray.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Let the glory of God rest upon this
[39:52] little child.
[39:54] I pray father God that the glory of your
[39:57] nearness will overshadow her. May Lord
[40:00] should bring joy again into the home.
[40:04] May oh God that she within her own life
[40:06] would be an expression of your grace.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; May Lord your hand
[40:12] &gt;&gt; a blessing be upon her is my prayer
[40:16] &gt;&gt; as we dedicate her back to you in the
[40:19] name of Jesus for your glory for your
[40:22] honor. Give wisdom to brother Toby. Give
[40:25] wisdom to Sister Rebecca. Grant to them
[40:29] favor, Lord, you. And I just pray now as
[40:33] this little family will leave this
[40:36] place. May your presence ever go before
[40:39] them in Jesus name.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:54] Amen. Bless you.
[41:04] Amen.
[41:06] Thankful for God's blessing.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:09] Just very thankful for the blessings of
[41:11] God. We're going to sing u song just as
[41:13] brother Biscll comes to bring the word.
[41:15] My hope is in the Lord. I stand in awe
[41:17] within the presence of the Lord. Let's
[41:20] sing it together
[41:22] as brother Ed comes.
[41:25] I stand in awe within the presence of
[41:30] the Lord.

[44:50] praise?
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:53] Amen. Just let you have your seats for a
[44:56] few moments.
[45:02] Hallelujah.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; We're really thankful for what God is
[45:08] doing.
[45:10] Amen. You've heard the announcement of
[45:13] our brother Junior Jeff uh passing early
[45:16] this morning and into the presence of
[45:18] God and uh we're we're happy for him.
[45:22] We're praying for his family. We have
[45:24] another uh testimony. We've been praying
[45:28] here at the church and others have been
[45:30] praying in in Europe and Switzerland and
[45:33] different places and uh I' I've heard
[45:36] from different places and on the map
[45:39] we've been praying for our brother Jean
[45:41] Jacques Michel in Switzerland
[45:45] and uh I just have a brief summary here.
[45:49] All I can tell you is that twice uh his
[45:53] family members have sent me word and
[45:56] also by telephone, by email that they
[45:59] actually walked into the hospital,
[46:01] walked into the room and watched watched
[46:04] with their physical eyes a miracle
[46:07] taking place in front of them. And uh
[46:10] that's wonderful.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; And we shouldn't be surprised at those
[46:14] things. But uh 10 days ago, that was
[46:16] October the 17th, so it's less than 10
[46:19] days.
[46:20] Brother Michel was rushed to the
[46:22] hospital unconscious.
[46:24] His heart rate was 250 beats and he had
[46:28] a a very high temperature, 39 plus,
[46:32] maybe over 40°,
[46:35] fever. The doctors diagnosed
[46:38] uh not only menitis, but it took them a
[46:40] couple of days after that to determine
[46:42] it was the most severe, worst kind of uh
[46:47] menitis
[46:49] that had attacked his brain. And so they
[46:52] placed him in in an induced coma.
[46:56] He was already unconscious, but they
[46:59] wanted to keep him because he was in
[47:01] very severe convulsions.
[47:04] After a couple of days, they tried to
[47:06] wake him, but his heart reacted
[47:09] negatively
[47:11] and they uh when they attempted to, he
[47:14] would enter into these severe
[47:15] convulsions
[47:17] from which he uh wouldn't recover. They
[47:20] didn't feel he would recover.
[47:22] So, the doctor said that his condition
[47:24] was terrible. That was their word.
[47:28] Uh they did an uh MRI which they call an
[47:31] IRM over there. They did a scan and they
[47:35] showed severe brain damage. They
[47:38] determined that 20% of his brain was uh
[47:41] destroyed.
[47:43] And uh they then they called the family
[47:46] to to be uh with him because they said
[47:50] that there was fluid around his brain
[47:54] and his brain was swelling and they had
[47:57] to take him off of the induced coma
[48:00] which they they said he would then go
[48:02] into these severe convulsions and they
[48:05] didn't expect that he could survive and
[48:07] they would be doing that within the
[48:09] hour. We received a phone call here to
[48:13] the office and I just gathered the
[48:15] brethren that were here. There was
[48:17] brother brother John Andes and brother
[48:21] Tom, brother Dier, brother Derek,
[48:25] brother Kim Dingwall was there as well.
[48:28] So we just gathered the brethren that
[48:29] were all there and we went to prayer and
[48:32] I just said whoever feels led to pray at
[48:35] this uh a very grave and serious moment
[48:39] let us uh enter into prayer and just
[48:41] pray as long as we felt we needed to. Uh
[48:46] they uh I I recall three times a
[48:51] statement was made in prayer,
[48:54] let the convulsion cease.
[48:57] Uh three specific times that was prayed.
[49:01] Let the convulsion cease.
[49:04] And uh
[49:07] the following morning the doctor came to
[49:09] the bedside and said, "Good morning, Mr.
[49:12] Michelo.
[49:13] whereupon brother Jean Jacques opened
[49:17] his eyes and the doctor they said almost
[49:20] fainted.
[49:22] Then his son Joel Joel arrived and
[49:25] whispered in his ear, "Hello dad, this
[49:28] is Joel." His dad opened his eyes and
[49:31] said, "Hello Joel."
[49:34] And from that from that moment he began
[49:37] to converse with the family. Now the
[49:39] doctors has said this that by Wednesday
[49:44] uh by this last Wednesday he was taken
[49:46] off a life support because he was
[49:48] completely on life support machine
[49:51] breathing for him. And by the time they
[49:54] took the indu took him out of the
[49:56] induced coma he began and off the
[49:59] breathing machine he began to breathe on
[50:01] his own. And by morning he was he was
[50:04] breathing 99% on his own and 1% with the
[50:08] machine. And so they took him off the
[50:11] machine completely. Uh and and then he
[50:15] began breathing naturally. When they
[50:17] took him off the induced coma they said
[50:20] that he remained in a natural coma and
[50:22] that is why in the morning when the
[50:24] doctor said good morning uh Mr. Michel
[50:28] and he opened his eyes. That's why there
[50:31] was such a surprise at that. And from
[50:33] that moment he began to converse with
[50:35] the family. He was hearing and moving
[50:38] around speaking even with a light sense
[50:41] of humor. The doctors said he would not
[50:44] be able to speak. He would not be able
[50:47] to uh uh have his uh have his senses
[50:51] back like that. And then then he sat for
[50:55] two hours in a wheelchair with no
[50:58] problem. On Friday, this last Friday,
[51:03] he was sitting, standing, eating well,
[51:07] and even asked for his laptop computer
[51:09] because he wanted to do something.
[51:12] And the doctors are calling him the
[51:15] miracle man.
[51:17] As reports have come in from the family,
[51:20] the emails have been shared and
[51:22] forwarded with others in need as an
[51:24] encouragement and witness of God's
[51:26] faithfulness and power. Just this
[51:29] morning, as I came to the study, I
[51:31] received the most recent, which my wife
[51:34] hasn't even been able to put down here.
[51:37] And we uh Brother Gerard and Sister
[51:40] Angela, and I believe that there's a
[51:41] group that are streaming the service
[51:44] right now. and members of brother
[51:46] Jeanjac's family and we want to greet
[51:49] them this morning and let them know that
[51:51] we join with them and we join with all
[51:54] the other people in the world that have
[51:56] been praying for him in Europe and
[51:57] Germany and Belgium and wherever and I
[52:01] believe that our brother and sister
[52:02] Iverson know them well and uh uh this I
[52:07] just got they received this phone call
[52:10] from the hospital that John Jocks has
[52:13] been taken out of emergency
[52:15] to a normal ward room and the doctors
[52:19] have made a complete neur neurological
[52:23] exams and found that everything is
[52:26] functioning perfectly. Now they're the
[52:29] same doctors.
[52:32] Amen.
[52:36] Hallelujah.
[52:38] Praise God.
[52:40] [Music]
[52:42] They are the same doctors in Geneva,
[52:44] Switzerland that said after an MRI that
[52:48] his brain was 20% destroyed. And they
[52:52] said that he would not have these
[52:54] functions. And the functions they said
[52:57] he would not have, he happens to have.
[53:00] And they said that they're functioning
[53:01] perfectly. And they just want to give
[53:03] God all the glory. Amen. So we give God
[53:06] all the glory.
[53:08] Amen. I feel that this morning we are
[53:11] here in his presence.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be in his
[53:14] presence? And it's so nice to have you,
[53:17] brother Hank, and Sister Iverson here.
[53:20] They're here for the wedding, of course,
[53:22] of their son, Simeon, who is brother
[53:24] Nathaniel's brother. And uh the wedding
[53:28] is taking place this uh next Saturday,
[53:31] November the 1st. Um, so we're happy to
[53:36] have them here and I believe they're
[53:38] going to be here for a time. So that's
[53:40] God bless them and God bless the
[53:43] wedding. Brother Simeon is marrying
[53:46] Sister Leah Barios
[53:49] and uh it's bittersweet. We are happy
[53:53] for him, but we're not happy that they
[53:55] have to go back to Belgium. But we'll
[53:58] keep strings attached
[54:01] and we're pretty good at that. Amen.
[54:04] Well,
[54:05] maybe you just stand with me and I'd
[54:07] like to just sing. Brother Rod of Wood,
[54:09] here we are in your presence just uh
[54:13] just to move into this uh preparation.
[54:16] You you were singing wonderfully and and
[54:18] I appreciate that so much. But let's
[54:20] just sing this as we move to read the
[54:23] word now.
[54:28] Here we are
[54:31] [Music]
[54:34] in your presence.
[54:37] [Music]
[54:40] Lifting holy hands to you,
[54:48] [Music]
[54:50] Lord. Here we are
[54:56] praising Jesus
[55:02] for the things he brought through.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the things he brought us
[55:09] through.
[55:11] [Music]
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Here we are.
[55:16] Let's lift our hearts up to him.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; In your presence,
[55:22] Lord, we're lifting
[55:25] holy hands to you.
[55:34] Here we are
[55:40] praising Jesus
[55:45] for the things he brought us through
[55:52] &gt;&gt; just with the prayer of thanksgiving.
[55:54] Dear father, we're so thankful because
[55:58] we serve a living God. You're the God of
[56:02] Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of
[56:04] Jacob, and of the prophets, father of
[56:06] our Lord Jesus Christ. You're the God of
[56:09] Elijah. You're the God of brother
[56:11] Brandham who came and with this mighty
[56:14] visitation. And we have had this
[56:16] visitation. You're the God of the bride
[56:18] of Jesus Christ. And so we worship you
[56:21] today in spirit and in truth. And we
[56:24] pray that truth will be imparted to us.
[56:26] that truth will be interpreted from your
[56:29] word into our very souls. We pray that
[56:32] you will give utterance, oh God, to
[56:35] myself as I stand here and this evening,
[56:38] Lord, in the service as brother Tom will
[56:40] minister. I pray that you will also give
[56:43] a a a reception, oh God, of receiving
[56:46] hearts, receptive hearts, minds,
[56:50] spiritual minds, oh God. And father, as
[56:53] a body of people, we take a firm stand
[56:57] against the enemy of our soul, against
[57:00] the enemy that would try to bind or
[57:02] hinder in any way. I ask that every
[57:05] need, Lord, within the walls of this
[57:07] building. You said to ask largely, so I
[57:09] ask that every need will be ministered
[57:12] to in Jesus Christ's name. And we
[57:15] rejoice in that victory. Amen and amen.
[57:19] Amen. God bless you. I'll have you turn
[57:23] in your Bibles please to Romans the 6th
[57:25] chapter
[57:29] and after we read three verses from
[57:32] 12-14
[57:34] then uh keep your Bibles open. You may
[57:37] have your seats but we'll be turning
[57:39] then immediately to Judges.
[57:42] After Deuteronomy then comes Judges.
[57:45] Joshua Judges.
[57:50] All right, we'll read.
[57:53] Let not sin, and let's remember that sin
[57:56] is unbelief.
[58:00] Let not sin therefore reign in your
[58:04] mortal body,
[58:06] that you that you should obey it in the
[58:10] lusts or desires thereof.
[58:13] Neither yield ye your members as
[58:16] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,
[58:19] but yield yourselves unto God, as those
[58:23] that are alive from the dead, and your
[58:26] members as instruments of righteousness
[58:29] unto God. So, we see in this scripture
[58:32] right away that that we have a a part to
[58:35] play. Yield yield your members as
[58:38] instruments to God. That yielding is our
[58:41] part. That's something that we do. And
[58:44] then for sin shall not have dominion
[58:47] over you, for you are not under the law,
[58:51] but under grace.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Sin shall not have or unbelief shall not
[58:58] have dominion.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; It shall not reign or control you
[59:04] &gt;&gt; because we're not under law but under
[59:06] grace. But we have a part in that we are
[59:10] to yield ourselves, our bodies are as
[59:13] instruments of God. And then sin will
[59:17] not have dominion over you.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; And that is quite simply when the word
[59:24] comes to us directly and speaks a
[59:26] certain thing, if we believe it and
[59:29] yield to it and act on that, sin will
[59:31] not have dominion over you. But if we
[59:34] hear it and resist it and you know just
[59:36] remain idle with it, then we come into
[59:40] bondage.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; All right, you may have your seats and
[59:43] if you'd please turn to Judges the 6th
[59:45] chapter and it'll take me a few moments
[59:48] in the service to tie these uh two
[59:51] thoughts together. But we're going to
[59:54] read about
[59:56] uh Gideon. And we all are familiar with
[59:58] Gideon.
[1:00:00] Uh it tells us in the first verse of
[1:00:03] Judges the 6th chapter and the children
[1:00:07] of Israel did evil in the sight of the
[1:00:09] Lord and the Lord delivered them into
[1:00:12] the hand of the Midian 7 years. Now when
[1:00:16] the scripture says and the and the
[1:00:18] children of Israel did evil, it always
[1:00:21] comes back to the one thing that they
[1:00:23] did not obey or believe the word. And so
[1:00:27] then they went into bondage. So it's
[1:00:30] exactly the same thing we read in
[1:00:31] Romans. If we yield, if we hear the word
[1:00:34] and yield ourselves, then uh then then
[1:00:37] sin shall not have dominion. They did
[1:00:40] not they heard but they did not follow
[1:00:42] through, did not believe, and they went
[1:00:44] into bondage. In this case, it was the
[1:00:47] Midian. Sometimes it was the Philistines
[1:00:49] for I think 40 years. Now they're in the
[1:00:51] hands of the Midians uh seven years and
[1:00:54] the hand of of Midian prevailed against
[1:00:57] Israel. And because of the Midianites,
[1:01:00] the children of Israel made them the
[1:01:02] dens which are in the mountains and
[1:01:04] caves and strongholds. And so it was
[1:01:07] when Israel had sown that the Midianites
[1:01:10] came up and the Amalachites and the
[1:01:13] children of the east even they came up
[1:01:16] against them. And they encamped against
[1:01:19] them, and destroyed the increase of the
[1:01:22] earth, till thou came unto Gaza, and
[1:01:26] left no substance for Israel, neither
[1:01:29] sheep, nor ox, nor ass. For they came up
[1:01:33] with their cattle, and their tents, and
[1:01:36] they came as grasshoppers for multitude,
[1:01:39] for both they and their camels were
[1:01:41] without number, and they entered into
[1:01:44] the land to destroy it. And Israel,
[1:01:47] notice this please, was greatly
[1:01:49] impoverished because of the Midianites.
[1:01:52] And the children of Israel cried unto
[1:01:55] the Lord. Then it goes on to say that
[1:01:58] the Lord sent a prophet their way. And
[1:02:01] if we go down to verse 11,
[1:02:05] and there came an angel of the Lord, and
[1:02:07] sat under an oak, which was in Ofra,
[1:02:11] and pertained unto Joash the Abrausite.
[1:02:16] And his son Kion thrashed wheat by the
[1:02:20] wine press
[1:02:22] to hide it from the Midianites. I wonder
[1:02:24] if that was legal by the Midianites law.
[1:02:30] I see her smiling.
[1:02:32] I don't think it was I think he was
[1:02:35] probably committing an illegal act.
[1:02:38] Otherwise, he wouldn't be hiding it, but
[1:02:41] he was hiding the wheat.
[1:02:43] That was uh by their law. And the angel
[1:02:46] of the Lord appeared unto him, verse 12,
[1:02:49] and said unto him, "The Lord is with
[1:02:51] thee, thou mighty man of valor." And
[1:02:54] Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if
[1:02:58] the Lord be with us, why then is all
[1:03:00] this befallen us? And where be all the
[1:03:04] his miracles which our fathers told us
[1:03:06] of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up
[1:03:10] from Egypt?" But now the Lord hath
[1:03:13] forsaken us, and delivered us into the
[1:03:15] hands of the Midionites. And the Lord
[1:03:17] looked upon him and said, "Go in this
[1:03:20] thy might, and thou shalt save Israel
[1:03:22] from the hand of the Midionites. Have
[1:03:25] not I sent thee?" And he said unto him,
[1:03:27] "Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save
[1:03:29] Israel? Behold, my family is poor in
[1:03:31] Manasseh, and I am least in my father's
[1:03:35] house." And the Lord said unto him,
[1:03:37] Surely I will be with thee, and thou
[1:03:39] shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
[1:03:42] And he said unto him, "If now I have
[1:03:44] found grace in thy sight, then show me a
[1:03:47] sign that thou talkest with me, depart
[1:03:50] not hence, I pray thee until I come unto
[1:03:53] thee, and bring forth my present." And
[1:03:56] and set it before thee. And he said, I
[1:03:59] will tarry until they'll come again. And
[1:04:01] Gideon went in and made a ready a kid
[1:04:04] and unleavened cakes of an epha of
[1:04:07] flour. The flesh he put in a basket, and
[1:04:10] he put the broth in a pot, and brought
[1:04:13] it out unto him unto the oak, and
[1:04:16] presented it. And the angel of God said
[1:04:20] unto him, "Take the flesh and unleaven
[1:04:23] cakes, and unleaven cakes, and lay them
[1:04:26] upon this rock, and pour out the broth."
[1:04:29] And he did so. Then the angel of the
[1:04:31] Lord put forth the end of the staff that
[1:04:34] was in his hand and touched the flesh
[1:04:36] and the unleavened cakes. And there
[1:04:38] arose up a fire out of the rock and
[1:04:41] consumed the flesh and the unleavened
[1:04:43] cakes. And then the angel of the Lord
[1:04:45] departed out of his sight. And when
[1:04:47] Gideon perceived that he was an angel of
[1:04:50] the Lord, a messenger of the Lord, you
[1:04:52] see, Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord God,
[1:04:55] for because I have seen an angel of the
[1:04:58] Lord face to face." And the Lord said
[1:05:00] unto him, "Peace be unto thee, fear not.
[1:05:03] Thou shalt not die." We'll cease our
[1:05:06] reading there. Now, the reason why I
[1:05:08] believe that God has has given this in
[1:05:12] such detail is brother Brandham said
[1:05:15] that the same angel of the Lord, the
[1:05:17] angel of the Lord here was like Elohim,
[1:05:20] the same one that met Abraham
[1:05:23] uh in the heat of the day. It's the same
[1:05:26] one. It's the angel of the Lord. And
[1:05:28] that's why he said that he the angel the
[1:05:30] God answered him and said you won't die
[1:05:32] because he thought that he would die
[1:05:34] having seen the angel of the Lord. Of
[1:05:37] course the reason why I believe that God
[1:05:40] uh uh made this such a profound
[1:05:44] experience in Gideon's life is for what
[1:05:47] Gideon had to do. And you know then he
[1:05:49] put the fleece before the Lord and uh
[1:05:52] you hear of Gideon's 300 and the a great
[1:05:55] victory which came about. But but I want
[1:05:59] to I I want to uh go back because I want
[1:06:02] to I need to make a uh I need to make a
[1:06:07] a comparison here between the
[1:06:11] gods of the Amalachites and the gods of
[1:06:15] the Midianites. And the Bible tells us
[1:06:17] that they that the children of Israel
[1:06:21] did evil in the sight of the Lord and
[1:06:22] the Lord delivered them into the hand of
[1:06:25] the Midians uh for seven years. Now,
[1:06:30] where God delivered them into the hand
[1:06:33] of the Medidianites, I need to
[1:06:37] uh get your thoughts in this direction
[1:06:40] that that nation, one time it's the
[1:06:43] Philistines, another time it's Babylon,
[1:06:45] another time it's the Midianites.
[1:06:48] Every nation has a a a a system under
[1:06:54] which they operate. And part of part of
[1:06:59] uh this uh system I will say because I'm
[1:07:02] going to be using the word system a
[1:07:04] great deal is is their worship and their
[1:07:07] gods for they had gods and that's why
[1:07:11] God always told his people the children
[1:07:14] of Israel that you will not worship
[1:07:17] their gods and you will not intermar
[1:07:20] because it will lead you to their
[1:07:23] worshiping their gods and you'll destroy
[1:07:26] destroy their gods. You are not to
[1:07:28] submit to their gods because in
[1:07:30] submitting to their gods, they they
[1:07:33] became controlled. They came under
[1:07:36] control. And you're either going to be
[1:07:38] the conqueror or the conquered.
[1:07:42] They're either going to serve you or
[1:07:44] you're going to serve them. And so I I
[1:07:47] want to uh speak on this unbelief
[1:07:51] or sin. unbelief shall not have dominion
[1:07:54] over you. And I'd like to actually give
[1:07:57] it a second title and that is the gods
[1:07:59] of Leodysa.
[1:08:01] Because while we may not have little
[1:08:03] idols and gods that are set up around
[1:08:06] the country or we do not have groves
[1:08:09] where people go to worship, but we are
[1:08:12] not a nation and we're not a people and
[1:08:15] we're not a generation without idolatry.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely everywhere.
[1:08:21] And Satan has permeated this whole
[1:08:25] generation
[1:08:26] with idolatry.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:08:30] Brother Brandham said, "You can make
[1:08:32] anything a god." He said, "You can make
[1:08:34] the piano a god.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; You can make your automobile, your
[1:08:38] possessions a god." A god is simply
[1:08:41] something that you do servitude to.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; You can make and we have many many
[1:08:46] systems. And I want to make a an I want
[1:08:49] to make a equate the gods of the
[1:08:53] heathens back in that day to the gods of
[1:08:56] the heathens in this day.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Now, uh you people are alive and you rub
[1:09:04] shoulders and you go to work and you
[1:09:08] hear people speak. I said, and I'll
[1:09:11] repeat again, the heathens of this
[1:09:14] generation
[1:09:16] That's right.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; And we're not uh uh uh we're not living
[1:09:21] amongst a people that's free. They can
[1:09:24] speak about, you know, America being
[1:09:27] free. Uh the western people of the
[1:09:30] Western world being free. They can talk
[1:09:32] about a free market and all the rest of
[1:09:34] it. But we are not a people that are
[1:09:36] free. In fact, people today are in deep
[1:09:40] slavery.
[1:09:42] They're in deep bondage. They're in
[1:09:45] bondage to very very many things and
[1:09:48] perhaps many task masters that are
[1:09:50] actually controlling the people. And we
[1:09:54] as believers
[1:09:56] there are there are uh parts of this uh
[1:10:00] system because we are a part of a
[1:10:02] nation. We're part of a society. We're
[1:10:05] part of the civilization of this age.
[1:10:08] And there are elements within our
[1:10:11] national structure that we must have.
[1:10:16] Uh but we must have the spirit of
[1:10:19] discernment because we need to know
[1:10:22] where that boundary is whether it is
[1:10:26] serving us or we are serving it.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; So this is kind of where I'm going. We
[1:10:35] have a we have a uh we have an
[1:10:37] educational system.
[1:10:40] Now, Brother Brandham says on one hand,
[1:10:43] and I'm just way ahead of myself, but I
[1:10:45] I want to make sure I get there. Brother
[1:10:47] Brandham says on one hand, I'm not
[1:10:49] against education
[1:10:52] because we need an education, but he
[1:10:55] turn around on the other hand and say
[1:10:57] education's of the devil.
[1:10:59] So, so now you have we have science and
[1:11:03] we because we have science, we have
[1:11:05] certain inventions, we have our
[1:11:07] computers, we have the internet, we have
[1:11:09] automobiles out in the parking lot.
[1:11:11] Science has brought these things. We
[1:11:14] have different appliances in our homes
[1:11:16] and so on. Science and invention and
[1:11:18] mankind has developed these things and
[1:11:21] we wouldn't have them if we didn't feel
[1:11:22] that they were a benefit to us. But
[1:11:25] there's a there's a line that has to be
[1:11:27] drawn whereby we it serves us, serves
[1:11:32] our purpose, serves our needs or we
[1:11:35] start serving it.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; And I have I have personally witnessed
[1:11:40] where I have spoken and and counseledled
[1:11:43] with people who I knew were now
[1:11:46] beginning to serve the God of education.
[1:11:51] And that God took them away from my God
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; and your God and they're not amongst us
[1:11:59] today because they began to serve
[1:12:01] another God.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; There are those that I believe a person
[1:12:05] can have a a light moment and can have
[1:12:08] some enjoyment, can have some R&R, and
[1:12:11] you can go and have some relaxation and
[1:12:13] some pleasure and and and enjoy some
[1:12:16] things. I don't think there's any any
[1:12:18] sin with knocking a a volleyball over a
[1:12:21] net, but there are those that have given
[1:12:24] themselves over to the God of pleasure.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; And I would say that a vast amount of
[1:12:30] our our living society today, people
[1:12:34] have given themselves over to pleasure
[1:12:36] and pleasureful things and they serve
[1:12:39] that God. And that God is not one twit
[1:12:43] different than the gods of the heathens
[1:12:45] of the Old Testament. It's the same kind
[1:12:48] of God. They may not have an idol, but
[1:12:50] they do have an idol. And you may say,
[1:12:53] "Now, Brother Brandham also said that
[1:12:55] the heathens did not believe that that
[1:12:58] idol was God. But they believe that that
[1:13:01] idol would speak to them. Their God
[1:13:03] would speak to them through that idol.
[1:13:05] In other words, they would have some uh
[1:13:08] communication. And they would have some
[1:13:11] um uh reciprocal thing happening. And I
[1:13:14] can tell you that people who have made
[1:13:17] education their god that god speaks to
[1:13:19] them through that idol.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; And they they will even say, you know,
[1:13:24] I'm benefited. I I I you know, I just do
[1:13:27] something. I I I I love this. When
[1:13:30] someone else loves pleasure, they give
[1:13:32] themselves to sports. literally give
[1:13:34] themselves give themselves to music
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; and make music of God.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; You folks ought to be responding
[1:13:43] differently.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; They've made music of God
[1:13:47] and that God ministers to them. That God
[1:13:50] speaks to them through the idol that
[1:13:52] they have made in their in their mind.
[1:13:57] Business,
[1:13:58] money, the economic system. Don't tell
[1:14:02] me people don't serve it. They've served
[1:14:04] it with everything that's in them. And
[1:14:06] and and that God has turned around and
[1:14:08] stung them recently.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And as the gods failed the heathens,
[1:14:15] this God has failed the heathens as
[1:14:17] well.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; And so it must be our servant
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; or it will be our master.
[1:14:26] And so the scripture has said that we
[1:14:30] cannot serve two masters.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; We cannot serve two masters. We cannot
[1:14:38] serve God and mammon. Only one. We can
[1:14:42] only serve one. So there's a boundary
[1:14:45] between that being a servant or it being
[1:14:48] a master. And that's the delicate
[1:14:51] balance that I want to speak about
[1:14:53] today. And it probably won't be the same
[1:14:55] boundary in everybody's life, but you
[1:14:57] have to be in tune with the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:00] The Holy Spirit has spoken to this
[1:15:02] generation through a vindicated
[1:15:05] prophet's mouth. And through that
[1:15:07] message, I say I can say to you
[1:15:09] unequivocally, you should be able to, if
[1:15:12] you're living in that realm of the
[1:15:14] spirit and not looking at the things
[1:15:16] which are seen because they're temporal.
[1:15:18] If you look at the things which are
[1:15:20] unseen, which are eternal, you God is is
[1:15:24] God is obliged and he is faithful to
[1:15:28] show you where that boundary is.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; And if we don't if we live on the side
[1:15:34] of it being our master, I just I'm
[1:15:37] getting I'm unloading this whole thing
[1:15:39] in just a few moments. But if we live on
[1:15:41] the on the side where be it the god of
[1:15:44] education, the god of pleasure, the god
[1:15:46] of business, the god of money, the
[1:15:48] economic system or any other system, if
[1:15:51] we live on that side of it where it is
[1:15:53] our master, it will lead you to death.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Not to life, but to death. You'll begin
[1:16:00] to wither and dry spiritually and dry up
[1:16:04] and and it will keep you. What about
[1:16:06] what about even the system of time? Now
[1:16:09] I was uh wanting to do some research. I
[1:16:11] wanted to find out you know when how did
[1:16:15] we develop to this place where we are
[1:16:18] controlled
[1:16:19] by not by hours but by minutes. And the
[1:16:23] Bible says that God uh he created the
[1:16:26] lights in the heavens for days and for
[1:16:28] seasons and for time so that time would
[1:16:32] be kept. And so there were in years past
[1:16:34] I suppose I don't know what the first
[1:16:36] instrument was but I know that they had
[1:16:38] you know the sun dial and I know that
[1:16:41] people who don't have you know uh
[1:16:43] perhaps watches that run by seconds they
[1:16:46] you know they get up in the morning well
[1:16:47] because it's dawning
[1:16:50] it at dawn is coming a day is breaking.
[1:16:53] It's not that they are uh uh pounding
[1:16:56] the pavement at 6:00 in the morning to
[1:16:59] get to work at 7 and they and or they
[1:17:03] have to get into the office and punch
[1:17:04] that clock. They didn't know anything
[1:17:06] about that, but they knew that, you
[1:17:08] know, they gathered in the scripture at
[1:17:09] the hour of prayer.
[1:17:12] And I don't know exactly when it was,
[1:17:14] but I uh you know, and we're we're quite
[1:17:16] precise. We say we're starting service
[1:17:18] at 10:30. Sometimes it's 10:35, but
[1:17:22] generally around that time we're in
[1:17:24] service and there's one tonight at 5:00
[1:17:27] and you'll look at your watch. But
[1:17:29] listen friends, not not because it's
[1:17:32] wrong. We need to I know you need to be
[1:17:34] at your place at a certain certain time,
[1:17:36] but this can be a very cruel master
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; because it goes beyond just being at a
[1:17:44] certain place at a certain time. Our
[1:17:46] lives become completely regulated.
[1:17:50] And we and and and by beginning you find
[1:17:53] out when you start to serve that God
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; that God if you serve it will leave you
[1:18:01] no time for your God.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Is that so?
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Have you not all struggled
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; trying to squeeze time out of the God of
[1:18:14] this age?
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Who developed it? Who who who who has
[1:18:18] cultivated and developed this
[1:18:20] civilization to this point to this
[1:18:22] fine-tuned where now it it you know it
[1:18:25] wasn't just a sun dial to tell you know
[1:18:28] that it was noon or midday or afternoon
[1:18:32] or whatever more. It hasn't done that,
[1:18:35] but it is it has got you down to seconds
[1:18:37] and and to hours and seconds and even,
[1:18:41] you know, 54 3 2 1 blastoff
[1:18:44] things are are just split seconds. So
[1:18:48] now I've got you kind of where I wanted
[1:18:52] you to to see where I want to equate the
[1:18:56] the the gods of the heathen nations to
[1:19:00] this present time that we're in.
[1:19:03] And then God through the leadership of
[1:19:05] the Holy Spirit should have absolute
[1:19:08] control of our lives.
[1:19:11] Now the scripture says, and I'm giving
[1:19:14] you some scripture which I just quoted
[1:19:15] from, while we look not at the things
[1:19:18] which are seen, but at the things which
[1:19:21] are not seen. For the things which are
[1:19:24] seen are temporal, but the things which
[1:19:27] are not seen are eternal.
[1:19:31] the things which are seen, the things
[1:19:33] which are not seen. Uh you know, we're
[1:19:36] we're influenced by things that are
[1:19:38] seen. Let's face it, I want to be very
[1:19:40] very I want to be brutally honest today.
[1:19:43] We are very much controlled by the
[1:19:45] things which are seen.
[1:19:49] And your prophet, my prophet, God's
[1:19:52] prophet said that these little five
[1:19:55] senses that we live in,
[1:19:58] that's uh uh that's the way
[1:20:03] that's the way that God gave us in this
[1:20:05] world, this little world of our own.
[1:20:09] He said we were only given these so we
[1:20:12] could contact our earthly home but their
[1:20:16] senses beyond that
[1:20:18] another dimension.
[1:20:22] He went on to say in this building
[1:20:24] tonight well I will say this building
[1:20:26] this morning
[1:20:28] stands Jesus Christ.
[1:20:32] I made some statements like this
[1:20:36] in Ukraine
[1:20:38] and there was uh 4 or 500 people there.
[1:20:42] And when I said in this building
[1:20:46] is Jesus Christ in this building is
[1:20:48] angels. It was like a holy reverence
[1:20:51] just dropped on the whole congregation.
[1:20:53] and they accepted it
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; and the and the atmosphere turned
[1:20:57] absolutely electric
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; because they believed it.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; And it says in this building stands
[1:21:05] Jesus Christ in this building tonight is
[1:21:08] hosts of angels.
[1:21:11] Thousands of them gathered around.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; We're a few hundred here, but there's
[1:21:17] thousands of them gathered around.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; I am accepting that. Amen.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; I am believing that
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; because it is that belief. It is that
[1:21:28] faith and the and the God who created
[1:21:31] all of those angels created them to be
[1:21:34] here
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; and they're dispatched. Certain ones are
[1:21:39] dispatched here. Your angel is here.
[1:21:44] He says, "You don't see them,
[1:21:47] but you can feel the influence of them
[1:21:50] telling you that they're here."
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to sense and feel
[1:21:56] that influence.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; And a person doesn't have to have any
[1:22:00] physical feeling, but we have a feeling
[1:22:04] uh something within us that says and
[1:22:06] witnesses deep down, I believe that.
[1:22:10] Amen.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; I receive that
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; and I wish and desire to be influenced
[1:22:17] by that unseen part of our uh of our
[1:22:22] worship and of our that God has provided
[1:22:24] for us.
[1:22:27] So I believe that we should strive to be
[1:22:29] directed by the things that are not
[1:22:32] seen.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; As I said earlier, we're either
[1:22:35] conquered or we're the conquerors.
[1:22:39] in God speaking to Mo through Moses the
[1:22:43] prophet of that day to them to the
[1:22:47] children of Israel. He said this to them
[1:22:48] and I'm reading this because I believe
[1:22:50] it's applicable to you that are here
[1:22:54] and to the people of this age. And the
[1:22:56] Lord shall make thee the head and not
[1:22:59] the tail.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be above only and thou
[1:23:05] shalt not be beneath.
[1:23:08] I'm saying you should be the conqueror,
[1:23:10] the victor, and you shall not be
[1:23:13] beneath.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; You're not to succumb to the systems
[1:23:18] that uh deprive you of your spiritual
[1:23:21] life and walk with God.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And I know that each one has their own
[1:23:25] struggle in this realm. I hope to be
[1:23:28] able to dwell on a little bit further.
[1:23:31] He said, "If if that thou if that thou
[1:23:35] hearken unto the commandments of the
[1:23:38] Lord," I say, if you hearken to the
[1:23:41] voice of God that has been brought to us
[1:23:43] in a message, that message, the prophet
[1:23:46] said, the end time message meets the end
[1:23:50] time conditions.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; And remember, don't forget this, Satan
[1:23:55] has always from the very beginning
[1:23:58] desired to be worshiped. That's why he
[1:24:01] came to Jesus Christ, the son of man, in
[1:24:04] his physical state on earth and said,
[1:24:06] "If you'll fall down and worship me,
[1:24:09] I'll give you this." And he had he had
[1:24:12] the uh the the control of the earth at
[1:24:14] that time. But it says, "If you will
[1:24:16] hearken under the commandments of the
[1:24:18] Lord thy God, which I command thee this
[1:24:20] day to observe and to do them, if you'll
[1:24:23] hearken to the commandments, you'll be
[1:24:24] the head and not the tail. If you
[1:24:27] hearken to the commandments, you'll be
[1:24:28] above and not beneath.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll say, if you hearken to
[1:24:32] the commandments, then you will be the
[1:24:34] conqueror.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; If you hearken to the commandments, then
[1:24:38] all the gods of these other all the
[1:24:40] other nations, they will be your
[1:24:42] servants
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; and they will and God will bring them to
[1:24:46] your benefit rather than to master be
[1:24:50] master over you.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; So, we cannot serve two masters.
[1:24:54] However, you can serve one master and he
[1:24:57] will instruct you by the Holy Spirit how
[1:25:01] to serve the other. Be it an employer,
[1:25:05] be it your business, be it your uh
[1:25:09] further education or whatever it is.
[1:25:11] Now, just because these things are right
[1:25:14] down to the grassroots of your life and
[1:25:16] my life, it doesn't mean that it's not
[1:25:19] deep spiritually.
[1:25:21] Well, what is difficult is to take
[1:25:23] something and there's I I've got pages
[1:25:26] of quotes here that I want you to be
[1:25:28] able to hear to let you know that God
[1:25:31] had the spirit of Elijah speak these
[1:25:34] things in a very definitive way because
[1:25:37] it's important to us.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; It's essential to us. No man can serve
[1:25:42] two masters, our Lord Jesus said. For
[1:25:45] either he will hate the one and love the
[1:25:49] other or else he will hold to the one
[1:25:52] and despise the other. You cannot serve
[1:25:55] God and Mammon.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; So there's nothing wrong with saying I I
[1:26:02] am I am using
[1:26:04] uh because God even said if you'll obey
[1:26:06] my commandments, these nations will
[1:26:09] serve you. Right.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; He said even they'll be tributaries to
[1:26:14] you.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; They'll serve you.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; I believe that the whole economic system
[1:26:19] should serve you.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; I said it should serve you.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; You should not become the servant
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; of the economic system. Whether it comes
[1:26:30] on a piece of paper or whether it comes
[1:26:33] on a plastic card called a a a Visa,
[1:26:37] Mastercard or whatever more. I believe
[1:26:39] it's wrong to become servant to it.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Use it, but don't serve it.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Where's that line? Will you let the Holy
[1:26:50] Spirit tell you where that line is? But
[1:26:53] I believe that it's wrong to become a a
[1:26:56] a servant to it. And so we need to uh we
[1:27:00] need to have this uh discernment. Now in
[1:27:06] Ephesians, Apostle Paul has said,
[1:27:08] "Servants, be obedient to them." Now,
[1:27:10] this just goes to show you now,
[1:27:12] "Servants, be obedient to them that are
[1:27:14] your masters according to the flesh with
[1:27:18] fear and trembling in singleness of your
[1:27:20] heart as unto Christ." as unto Christ.
[1:27:24] I'm so glad. But if they if they told
[1:27:27] you, and I have I'm looking down in a
[1:27:29] congregation. I have people who have had
[1:27:32] uh who have had good occupations but
[1:27:35] their employer has said when you come to
[1:27:38] a certain station where you need to
[1:27:40] report I want you to report falsely
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; that's a believer
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to report falsely I want you
[1:27:51] to report report false weight I want you
[1:27:54] to tell them a lie so what what's a
[1:27:57] believer do
[1:27:59] he has to be master over that
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; that master says as as Christ well
[1:28:05] Christ isn't going to require you to
[1:28:08] serve booze
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; he's not going to require you to do a
[1:28:12] bunch of ungodly things he's not going
[1:28:14] to require you to lie and be untruthful
[1:28:17] and that's where a person needs to he's
[1:28:20] not going to require you and he's not
[1:28:22] going to deprive you listen closely he's
[1:28:26] not going to deprive you of the very
[1:28:28] spiritual fellowship that you need.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; You need spiritual fellowship. And if my
[1:28:36] employer said, "Well, you can't uh you
[1:28:39] know, you you have to work this
[1:28:42] Wednesday and you have to work every
[1:28:43] weekend." That that that would be the
[1:28:45] end of my conversation.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; That'd be the end of my conversation
[1:28:49] right there. I said, "Well, you know, I
[1:28:51] may have to miss a service or I may have
[1:28:53] to miss, you know, because of a a
[1:28:55] certain schedule, but I will not let
[1:28:57] this God
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; deprive me
[1:29:02] and deprive my God of worship
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; because I want to come and I want to
[1:29:07] worship with the household of faith. I
[1:29:10] need to worship and that God is not
[1:29:13] going to dictate my life to me.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; You're going to serve me."
[1:29:19] Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Serve my purpose. Serve my ends. And you
[1:29:24] know what? God will honor that.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; God will honor that.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Well, I I I need to because of of the
[1:29:32] finances. Now, we've gone to another
[1:29:34] god.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; See, so we have all of these gods of
[1:29:41] Leodysia, of this age, in this
[1:29:43] generation. But Apostle Paul tells us to
[1:29:46] serve our masters, to serve them with
[1:29:49] fear and trembling and singleness of
[1:29:51] heart, not with eye service
[1:29:54] as men pleasers, but as servants of
[1:29:56] Christ, doing the will of God from the
[1:29:59] heart, with good will, doing service as
[1:30:03] to the Lord, and not to man, knowing
[1:30:06] that whatsoever good thing any man
[1:30:08] doeth, the same shall he receive of the
[1:30:11] Lord, whether he be bond or free. So it
[1:30:15] says as we do that and we serve
[1:30:18] we serve our our earthly master with
[1:30:21] singleness of heart with fear and
[1:30:23] trembling and reverence etc. which is
[1:30:25] foreign to this is foreign language to
[1:30:28] this day.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; People serve their employer and and and
[1:30:33] with disrespect and curse them out and
[1:30:37] try to slough off on their job and all
[1:30:39] the rest of it. Listen, what Apostle
[1:30:41] Paul is teaching is that when we serve
[1:30:43] them according to the word, we don't get
[1:30:45] a reward from him. You might get a
[1:30:48] paycheck or something on your uh IRA or
[1:30:51] whatever, but we we we get it from God.
[1:30:54] God's the one who rewards us.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; He can make your money go further.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; He does all the time.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; He can prosper your field,
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; prosper your home.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; He can just turn things like that
[1:31:10] Hallelujah.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; People who say, "I can't afford to
[1:31:15] tithe." You can't afford not to tithe.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; You can't afford not to tithe to begin
[1:31:21] with. It's not your money.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; It's God's money.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And what what country in the world has
[1:31:27] has had their taxes at 10% for 4,000
[1:31:30] years?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; It's only It's been 10% since the
[1:31:37] beginning.
[1:31:38] Every country raises their taxes, raises
[1:31:40] their taxes, but but this economy has
[1:31:43] been the same.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; God's continued to operate everything
[1:31:46] with his tithing and 10% and then
[1:31:49] offerings if you feel to do so, knowing
[1:31:51] that whatsoever good thing any man
[1:31:53] doeth, the same shall he receive of the
[1:31:55] Lord, whether he be bond or free.
[1:31:59] And you masters now some of your
[1:32:02] employers do the same things unto them
[1:32:04] forbearing
[1:32:06] uh uh and and ye masters do the same
[1:32:10] things unto them forbearing uh
[1:32:13] forbearing threatening knowing that your
[1:32:15] master also is in heaven is in heaven
[1:32:18] neither is their respect of persons with
[1:32:21] him
[1:32:24] now there are some systems in the world
[1:32:26] and I don't want to spend any time on
[1:32:28] this but some of the ones that are are
[1:32:30] so very prominent. You know, communism
[1:32:33] was a big thing some few years ago, but
[1:32:36] but it's actually based on a system and
[1:32:39] the system is an economic system uh in
[1:32:42] which the means of production are
[1:32:46] distributed uh to the open competing uh
[1:32:49] profit. That's capitalism rather and and
[1:32:52] the seeking seeking of a free market.
[1:32:54] And communism is a system that's been
[1:32:56] put forward. These are some words that
[1:32:58] I've just chosen by revolutionary
[1:33:00] thinkers such as Lenon and Marx and and
[1:33:03] these kind of people and uh and and it
[1:33:07] is believed they believed it was
[1:33:08] necessary to absolutely abolish private
[1:33:13] uh property and thus doing away with the
[1:33:15] ruling class and turning everything over
[1:33:18] to uh uh to to the
[1:33:23] people to the workers. That was their
[1:33:25] whole scheme. And it's great in theory,
[1:33:27] but it didn't work because actually, you
[1:33:30] know, these are my words once again, but
[1:33:31] I think that communism as it as it's
[1:33:34] been demonstrated in the world is the
[1:33:35] highest form of capitalism because it
[1:33:38] actually took took the ownership from
[1:33:40] the people and let just a very very
[1:33:43] small ruling class live like kings.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They're the ones they're the ones.
[1:33:51] I I spoke with a brother who was a
[1:33:53] minister over just when communism was
[1:33:55] falling and he actually kind of wanted
[1:33:57] it to come back because his apartment
[1:34:02] cost $160 US a month.
[1:34:06] They paid everything.
[1:34:09] But the same brother couldn't go and
[1:34:11] find any meat. Could hardly find
[1:34:14] anything to buy. Didn't have money to
[1:34:16] buy it anyway. And I gave them I gave
[1:34:20] them a little box of food and gave them
[1:34:23] $50 US. Went a $160 US. So we paid for
[1:34:28] their room for a long period of time.
[1:34:31] But when I gave them $50, they just
[1:34:33] broke into open sobbing. They didn't
[1:34:36] even imagine that kind of money in their
[1:34:39] hands. And and and and so did communism
[1:34:43] provide the actual working class? No.
[1:34:47] Nothing. But were they serving that
[1:34:49] system? Absolutely. They'd serve it and
[1:34:52] even wanted it to come back. And these
[1:34:55] are people who were you know um
[1:34:59] Christians as such. So these are
[1:35:01] controlling systems and within the
[1:35:04] framework of every nation
[1:35:07] and we have we have all kinds of
[1:35:09] controlling systems here. You you might
[1:35:11] say do do you live by it? Yeah, you do.
[1:35:15] They tell the system tells you.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; The system tells you how much tax you're
[1:35:21] going to pay.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; To keep the system going to come down
[1:35:26] and control you.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; This is not a philosophy.
[1:35:33] This is actual fact. So the system tells
[1:35:36] you how much tax you'll pay. You don't
[1:35:39] tell it. You don't go to the cash
[1:35:42] register in a store at Walmart or
[1:35:43] wherever and say, "I refuse to pay that
[1:35:46] tax." No, they tell you what to pay.
[1:35:49] They tell you how much to pay. The the
[1:35:51] the system within your state or your
[1:35:54] county or your city tells you what
[1:35:57] you'll pay
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; on your house tax.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; It's control.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; They'll tell you, the medical system
[1:36:05] will tell you what you're going to pay.
[1:36:08] And this is not just this is not just
[1:36:10] having to do with money and economics.
[1:36:13] This is having to do with your health,
[1:36:15] having to do with your food.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Who here had any control of inflation?
[1:36:22] You don't have any control of inflation.
[1:36:24] It controls you.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; And we do service to it.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Because in paying it, we keep it going.
[1:36:39] You pay for your protection.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; You pay for your police force or
[1:36:45] policemen who are here in the church.
[1:36:48] You have nothing to say about how much
[1:36:50] you pay for them. It is paid.
[1:36:54] They determine whether you will, you
[1:36:57] know, what you pay on your fire and what
[1:36:59] you pay on everything else. It's all
[1:37:01] controlled
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; and you work daily to serve that.
[1:37:06] You're in servitude to it. But there is
[1:37:09] a line in all of these things. It's very
[1:37:12] very complex.
[1:37:14] I have a lot to say about it, but it's
[1:37:17] very very complex.
[1:37:19] And and we have to be very very certain
[1:37:23] that when we have uh something of the
[1:37:26] Holy Spirit that begins to speak to us
[1:37:30] and say, you know, thus far, no further.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:35] that that's where we draw the line.
[1:37:40] So just listen now.
[1:37:45] I want to make this relevant into
[1:37:48] today's scene.
[1:37:51] in the beginning
[1:37:54] when Satan came and used the serpent
[1:37:58] now because I've talked about a number
[1:38:01] of systems etc etc but now we'll talk
[1:38:04] about the system of religion
[1:38:09] so we do not want the message to become
[1:38:13] to be a system
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; this is under the direction of the Holy
[1:38:18] Spirit
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; and Many people come into the message
[1:38:22] and they've come out of a religious
[1:38:24] system. So they expect the message to
[1:38:27] operate in the same manner.
[1:38:30] Well, the church I was in, they looked
[1:38:33] after my children in a daycare and they
[1:38:36] counseledled with I had every little
[1:38:38] thing to do and they did this and they
[1:38:40] helped me there and when I didn't have
[1:38:41] food, they delivered food to me. It it's
[1:38:44] a system, but that may not be God's
[1:38:46] system. God's system might be you get
[1:38:48] out and you work with your hands and you
[1:38:50] do what is necessary and you trust him.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; But in the beginning, Satan's cunning
[1:38:59] tactic becomes clear from the very very
[1:39:02] beginning. And don't forget the one that
[1:39:05] was in the garden is the one that has
[1:39:07] developed this system.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's it.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Yay. Hath God said,
[1:39:17] "You shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:39:20] garden?"
[1:39:23] So now he's coming and saying,
[1:39:26] "Is the word of God,
[1:39:29] God's order,
[1:39:31] and God's system of life,
[1:39:33] is it holding you back,
[1:39:36] depriving you of your real potentials?
[1:39:41] Hath God said, "You shall not eat of
[1:39:44] every tree of the garden?" In other
[1:39:45] words, he says exactly the same thing
[1:39:48] today. And and the serpent said to the
[1:39:50] woman, uh, you shall not surely die
[1:39:53] because that that whole thing come. I'm
[1:39:56] talking now from experience. I've talked
[1:39:58] to lots of people and they have felt
[1:40:02] that somehow
[1:40:04] I'm talking now about the message
[1:40:06] because to me that's God's system.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:09] and they begin to feel that the
[1:40:12] restraints of the message is holding
[1:40:15] them back from getting where they could
[1:40:18] really get to. Uh I don't know if the
[1:40:22] young lady is here,
[1:40:25] but she had and if she's here, she won't
[1:40:28] mind, I'm sure, but she had separated
[1:40:30] herself from the faith of the believers.
[1:40:35] had separated herself from the
[1:40:37] fellowship of the believers and and I
[1:40:40] saw God speaking to her
[1:40:43] and I went to her and spoke with her and
[1:40:47] she was separating herself be just for
[1:40:49] one small thing. She has a desire.
[1:40:53] So now Satan has taken a hold of the
[1:40:56] desire and her desire became a god.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; And she wanted now and that that's that
[1:41:05] can be in anybody's place.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; And she she just has a desire a a love
[1:41:10] for she said I want to be a hairdresser
[1:41:15] and I know that I can't cut hair if I
[1:41:18] remain a believer. I know that I can't
[1:41:22] cut a lady's hair and that one little
[1:41:24] thing. But Satan was feeding that
[1:41:27] desire.
[1:41:29] Are you with me?
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Now, that may not mean a whole lot to
[1:41:32] some people, but to me as a pastor, it
[1:41:34] was that girl's soul.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; And that happens to be very, very
[1:41:42] important,
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; a girl's soul.
[1:41:47] And Satan was using and anointing that
[1:41:49] desire
[1:41:51] until it loomed so big. She's prepared
[1:41:54] to give up the songs that you and I
[1:41:57] sing. Prepared to give up
[1:42:00] the the whole atmosphere of the Holy
[1:42:04] Spirit, the angels. Prepared to give up.
[1:42:07] Maybe you sit here, you don't even know
[1:42:09] until I quote, maybe some of you young
[1:42:11] people don't even know the thing that
[1:42:12] you feel and that you sense and you
[1:42:14] wonder what it is. You know it's not the
[1:42:16] person sitting next to you. You need a
[1:42:18] prophet's message to tell you you're
[1:42:20] you're actually sensing angels, but you
[1:42:22] don't know it.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the
[1:42:26] very spirit of God, the creator of
[1:42:28] heavens and earth comes into a place
[1:42:30] like this and maybe people are to
[1:42:32] completely unaware of it. But God, but
[1:42:34] Satan will raise up something in a
[1:42:36] person's in a person's life or in their
[1:42:38] desires or in their who knows amongst
[1:42:40] their friends, amongst their associates,
[1:42:42] whatever more and it just starts drawing
[1:42:44] them
[1:42:47] Where is it drawing? And who is it
[1:42:49] that's drawing? And what is it? That
[1:42:50] thing, whatever it is, becomes a god.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; And it is drawing you to bondage
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; and to death.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it does.
[1:43:04] And so he he he says the serpent said to
[1:43:07] the woman, "You shall not surely die."
[1:43:10] He came right to the point. He said,
[1:43:12] "This isn't going to cost you death. The
[1:43:15] thing that God is withholding from you
[1:43:18] certainly won't bring any harm or death
[1:43:21] for you. Huh?
[1:43:26] For God knows that in the day you eat
[1:43:28] thereof, then your eyes shall be opened,
[1:43:31] and you shall be as gods, knowing good
[1:43:33] and evil." And now notice this. And the
[1:43:37] woman uh and and the woman saw the tree
[1:43:41] that was good for food and that was
[1:43:44] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[1:43:46] desired. That tree is still here today.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; The tree of good and knowledge is still
[1:43:54] present. It won't be here in the future.
[1:43:57] The tree of life is here as well.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said you're every
[1:44:02] man, every woman makes the same
[1:44:03] decision. Now, it's not back on Adam and
[1:44:06] Eve. It's on us.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; We make the same decision. And uh and
[1:44:11] and and so she this was this was the
[1:44:15] tactic. And many things appear like he
[1:44:18] made it to appear that day. Make them to
[1:44:21] appear necessary.
[1:44:23] Make them to appear pleasant. Now, I'm
[1:44:27] not here to draw any lines. I'm here to
[1:44:29] expose the things so that you can draw
[1:44:32] the line. So the Holy Spirit can speak
[1:44:34] to you and draw the line
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; in in Christ is the mystery. Uh brother
[1:44:40] Brand used this. He spoke these words.
[1:44:43] Why do you hunger? I just like to stop
[1:44:45] there. Why do you hunger, church? Why do
[1:44:48] you hunger?
[1:44:50] Why do you thirst?
[1:44:53] Said it's the father trying
[1:44:56] to reveal his hidden secret to you.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; And then he put it this way. But you let
[1:45:02] so many things
[1:45:05] get it out of you to get the hunger out,
[1:45:08] to get the thirst out. So many things.
[1:45:11] You let your job,
[1:45:14] you let your wife.
[1:45:17] And I'll say something to wives right
[1:45:18] here. Don't keep your husband so busy
[1:45:20] that they don't have time for God.
[1:45:29] You let your husband
[1:45:32] Husbands,
[1:45:34] don't keep the wives in a place where
[1:45:36] they don't have a quiet time,
[1:45:41] a quality time with God.
[1:45:46] Everything else,
[1:45:48] you know, all the things that we agitate
[1:45:53] and move around in our daily life. And I
[1:45:56] know you're quiet and I know what I'm
[1:45:58] saying. I need to say. Amen.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Satan in this age, in this generation,
[1:46:07] do you know that people just recently in
[1:46:10] fact is
[1:46:12] this whole economic meltdown? They talk
[1:46:14] about an economic meltdown.
[1:46:17] Do you know that people sold their souls
[1:46:20] to get to where they are financially to
[1:46:24] only have it absolutely evaporate in a
[1:46:27] matter of days? Do you know that a
[1:46:29] couple days ago, first thing in the
[1:46:31] morning, I haven't even heard news for a
[1:46:33] long time, but but in Europe, it wasn't
[1:46:36] it wasn't headlines. It was entire
[1:46:39] sections of the international papers,
[1:46:42] the papers from London and the and the
[1:46:45] Herald Tribune from Paris and other give
[1:46:47] entire sections of the newspaper. Europe
[1:46:50] was melting down because of what was
[1:46:53] taking place in the United States
[1:46:57] and people's earnings they've been
[1:46:59] saving. They've been paying into their
[1:47:02] into their retirement funds and the
[1:47:05] retirement funds are just disappearing
[1:47:07] overnight. It might get to the place and
[1:47:09] might be there now where you and I are
[1:47:12] learning we have to depend on God. Amen.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Our God is your best retirement.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; As of last night,
[1:47:25] the national debt of uh of United States
[1:47:28] and we don't have one for Canada that I
[1:47:31] could that I spend any time to find
[1:47:33] because it would be infatismal
[1:47:37] compared to America.
[1:47:39] But America the great dynamic powerhouse
[1:47:44] Now, God knows what he's doing. God knew
[1:47:47] why he had a prophet raised up out of
[1:47:49] that nation
[1:47:51] because that is the remaining superpower
[1:47:53] of the earth.
[1:47:55] And they are the dynamic.
[1:47:58] They're the dynamics of the economic
[1:48:00] system of the world.
[1:48:04] There were at as of last night there's
[1:48:07] 10 trillion
[1:48:09] 500 and some billion debt
[1:48:15] and uh brother Rod I don't know if he's
[1:48:18] still here he sent me a letter and I
[1:48:21] haven't read the whole letter but there
[1:48:23] was a a man who has written called the
[1:48:26] Dao letter for the last 50 years and he
[1:48:31] has been exceedingly accurate it with
[1:48:35] his writing. He has predicted when
[1:48:38] markets were going down. He's predicted
[1:48:40] not minutes, days. He's not into that.
[1:48:42] He's into the whole general scenario
[1:48:46] whether things are good times are coming
[1:48:48] or difficult times are coming. And I
[1:48:50] understand he's never missed.
[1:48:53] And he said that America
[1:48:56] something in this order. America has
[1:48:59] always been able to print themselves out
[1:49:01] of these crises because all other
[1:49:05] nations can't afford to lose them
[1:49:09] because they're the they're the dynamic
[1:49:11] behind the they they consume a
[1:49:14] tremendous amount. They buy a tremendous
[1:49:16] amount and and these other countries
[1:49:18] need to need to uh sell and export to
[1:49:23] America.
[1:49:25] They said something on this order and I
[1:49:27] may not have it completely correct
[1:49:30] but he said and I I just know a wee bit
[1:49:33] about this but he he related to the gold
[1:49:37] standard and brother Brandham spoke
[1:49:39] about the gold standard.
[1:49:42] He said
[1:49:45] that
[1:49:47] United States is the only nation,
[1:49:51] the only nation that has refused to
[1:49:54] acknowledge the free the free uh the
[1:49:59] free market value of gold. They have
[1:50:02] held it at the $35 an ounce.
[1:50:06] As far as themselves as a as a nation is
[1:50:09] concerned, they've held it at $35 an
[1:50:11] ounce. I was in Toronto
[1:50:15] when President de Gaulle of France
[1:50:18] required that America pay and take all
[1:50:22] their paper money and pay them pay
[1:50:24] France in gold.
[1:50:26] And that is when gold left all other
[1:50:29] nations. That is when it left the $35 an
[1:50:33] ounce and began to start. And when it
[1:50:36] went to about like 70, 75, and 80, you
[1:50:39] know, it was tripling its value. It was
[1:50:41] just shaking and there was a there was a
[1:50:44] a a real loud voice within the Senate
[1:50:48] and and because it amounted to about 40
[1:50:50] to 45 billion that America had to
[1:50:54] provide in gold and buy the paper back
[1:50:57] and the and there was an uproar in the
[1:50:59] Senate of United States government
[1:51:01] because they said they still owe us,
[1:51:04] France still owes us the war debt and
[1:51:07] the war debt is about exactly the same
[1:51:09] amount.
[1:51:11] And so just let it be a wash and just
[1:51:15] tell President de Gaul, we'll just take
[1:51:18] that for your war debt. We're not paying
[1:51:20] you back in gold. But America being the
[1:51:23] good neighbor that they are and the
[1:51:25] generous people that they are paid and
[1:51:29] took their money back and gave them
[1:51:31] gold. and gold then went completely off
[1:51:35] the off the radar and has been going up
[1:51:38] and down ever since.
[1:51:41] But this gentleman says,
[1:51:43] and I'm spending more time with this
[1:51:45] than I had anticipated, but just give me
[1:51:47] a few moments. This gentleman says
[1:51:50] who writes the Dow letter.
[1:51:53] He says, "America has never acknowledged
[1:51:58] that gold is off of the $35 an ounce."
[1:52:03] So, because they are the powerhouse, if
[1:52:06] they should say, for example, all right,
[1:52:09] we'll unhinge it. We'll okay, it's going
[1:52:13] to be free, then we'll say it. We're the
[1:52:16] ones we'll say it it's loosed from the
[1:52:19] $35 an ounce. And this man said, "How
[1:52:23] would you like $30,000
[1:52:25] an ounce?" Because by if they have to
[1:52:29] pay in gold, they let it go screaming up
[1:52:33] to some absurd figure which will reduce
[1:52:37] their debt from trillion, 10 trillion
[1:52:40] maybe down to just a quarter of that or
[1:52:43] less and let it go screaming up there.
[1:52:47] Now, brother Brandham said some very
[1:52:49] very specific things about the gold
[1:52:51] market and the gold standard. And he he
[1:52:55] even he even went as far as to say the
[1:52:56] one thing that Castro did which was
[1:52:58] right was change the order of the money.
[1:53:02] Change it and print new money. And I
[1:53:04] happen to have been now through several
[1:53:06] nations that have reprinted their money
[1:53:08] and changed their money and and and you
[1:53:12] people from Europe, you know a little
[1:53:13] bit more about that. But suddenly
[1:53:17] things that brother Brandham has said
[1:53:19] about the gold standard
[1:53:22] and where the gold is and he says Rome
[1:53:27] said in one place specifically
[1:53:29] he may have said they own it but he says
[1:53:32] in one place Rome controls
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; the gold of the world.
[1:53:42] South America was in se severe debt
[1:53:45] crisis
[1:53:47] not very long ago.
[1:53:50] Pope John Paul
[1:53:52] and I saw it on the television. I don't
[1:53:56] know where I was, but I saw him on the
[1:53:58] television and he walked in to the
[1:54:01] United Nations,
[1:54:03] the United Nations of all the world,
[1:54:07] and he chastised them. Now, here's a man
[1:54:11] that hasn't got tanks,
[1:54:14] hasn't got missiles,
[1:54:16] doesn't have an army, but has more power
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; than all those nations put together.
[1:54:24] And he exercised that power because
[1:54:29] because South America, Brazil, and
[1:54:32] Venezuela, and some of those countries
[1:54:35] owed the US banks and Canadian banks and
[1:54:39] European banks hundreds and hundreds of
[1:54:42] millions of dollars.
[1:54:46] The Pope stood on their behalf. Why?
[1:54:49] Because they're Catholic.
[1:54:53] and he chastised the other nations and
[1:54:56] essentially commanded them to forgive
[1:54:59] that debt.
[1:55:01] And the Canadian government, the
[1:55:03] Canadian banks forgave hundreds of
[1:55:06] millions of dollars of debt. And he's
[1:55:10] the one who called for it
[1:55:12] because
[1:55:14] do they not have gold? Yeah, they have
[1:55:16] gold. But he had he exercised his power
[1:55:19] to forgive those debts.
[1:55:22] You see friends,
[1:55:24] don't don't don't f don't mistake me
[1:55:29] when that prophet says they control the
[1:55:32] gold. That's exactly what it means.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; They control and I'm saying they're
[1:55:39] controlling systems
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; which you and I we need. He says one
[1:55:44] place now you may think that I'm I'm
[1:55:46] really off base here. says one place in
[1:55:48] the beginning they didn't have to wear
[1:55:50] clothes but we have to wear clothes.
[1:55:53] See
[1:55:54] in other words we have to we have to be
[1:55:59] modest but we don't have to serve the
[1:56:02] god of fashion.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; We don't have to have every latest color
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; and every latest style.
[1:56:12] Amen.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; And if you get on that treadmill, you're
[1:56:16] simply bowing to a God of this age.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Says on the one hand, I'm not against
[1:56:23] education because you need an education.
[1:56:26] How far you go in the education, that's
[1:56:28] strictly between you and God.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; We haven't got anything here. It says
[1:56:31] you got to drop out at 8 or no, you have
[1:56:33] to go to 12 or you need your diploma.
[1:56:35] Oh, no, you need to go and have further
[1:56:37] education, whatever more. I'm happy for
[1:56:39] everyone here that has got the education
[1:56:41] that they have got. But don't forget
[1:56:43] that it is a God.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; And this little man that stands here
[1:56:48] before you has has I I've agonized
[1:56:52] because I saw that God begin to tell
[1:56:56] that person what they could do
[1:56:58] spiritually and what they couldn't do
[1:57:00] spiritually. And they're gone.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; They're gone. And you know what that God
[1:57:05] brought them? Death.
[1:57:08] death,
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; a spiritual death. You might say, "Well,
[1:57:11] what were they predestinated to?" I
[1:57:13] don't know what what what God's order
[1:57:15] predestination is. But I know one thing
[1:57:18] that we are to exhort. We're to
[1:57:20] admonish. We are to preach. And I can
[1:57:23] tell you that the word and the message
[1:57:25] which we have received has the answer
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; for every end time condition. And I
[1:57:32] don't care what condition you're in
[1:57:34] today, whether you're employed,
[1:57:36] unemployed, whether you're rich, whether
[1:57:37] you're poor, whether you have enough, or
[1:57:39] you have nothing, or you're way below
[1:57:41] the uh where you're in a crisis, a
[1:57:44] financial crisis, or whatever. All I can
[1:57:46] tell you is that Satan operates in every
[1:57:49] one of those systems. And we are called
[1:57:51] on to not to serve them,
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; to use them,
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; but not to serve them.
[1:58:00] going to take a few more minutes.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; He says this, I talk about the system of
[1:58:11] religion just now for a moment.
[1:58:14] He says the false church groups come
[1:58:18] together. Now, the reason why I'm going
[1:58:19] to read quite a bit and I want you to
[1:58:20] follow it very closely. Follow it very
[1:58:22] closely because you'll it tie together
[1:58:24] how that this whole economic thing
[1:58:27] really
[1:58:30] it really is part of a religious system.
[1:58:35] We talk about Rome. Rome is not merely
[1:58:38] an economic system. It's a religious
[1:58:40] system. Do you see how powerful
[1:58:45] that God is? Amen.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; You talk about the God of the
[1:58:49] Medidianites and the God of the Am
[1:58:51] Amalachites and all these other god of
[1:58:53] the Jebusites and everything else. They
[1:58:55] have nothing on this generation.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe they controlled 10,000
[1:59:00] people or a 100,000 people. We're
[1:59:03] talking about a a man in a system that
[1:59:05] controls literally controls directly
[1:59:08] over a billion people, but indirectly
[1:59:11] actually he'll control the earth.
[1:59:14] That's right.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; The false church groups will come
[1:59:18] together in a world council of churches.
[1:59:21] They have this world council of churches
[1:59:25] is the image erected to the beast. So
[1:59:28] now you know that I know that you've
[1:59:30] read that before. Now remember it is
[1:59:32] imperial pagan Rome that fell by the
[1:59:35] sword. But she was healed of her death
[1:59:38] stroke when she joined in the nominal
[1:59:41] church, Christian church of Rome and
[1:59:44] incorporated paganism and Christianity.
[1:59:48] She's the one that has done it. Satan
[1:59:50] through the instrumentality of that
[1:59:53] system, that's a system united those two
[1:59:56] together, paganism and Christianity, and
[2:00:00] thereby became the Holy Roman Empire. He
[2:00:03] said, "This may seem far-fetched." He
[2:00:06] said, "I'll just I'm trying to hurry
[2:00:08] here. Have to forgive me." He said,
[2:00:10] "Which was to endure until Jesus came
[2:00:14] and destroyed her, but Rome is not going
[2:00:16] it alone. Her daughters are right with
[2:00:19] her, and she will take over absolute
[2:00:22] authority by the World Council of
[2:00:25] Churches."
[2:00:29] This may seem far-fetched to some, but
[2:00:32] actually it is very plain for all to see
[2:00:35] because right now the churches are
[2:00:37] controlling the politics.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; So churches are controlling the
[2:00:43] politics.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; You accept that? Amen. Amen.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; So politics is actually serving to the
[2:00:52] churches and at the opportune time we'll
[2:00:55] manifest exactly how great that that is
[2:01:00] that control. This ecumenical move will
[2:01:03] end up with Rome at the head.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Even though the people did not envision
[2:01:08] it that way.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Hey, I I know all kinds of people I've
[2:01:12] talked to. They never envisioned that
[2:01:14] they'd be swept into that. the
[2:01:16] ecumenical thing would be swept into
[2:01:18] Rome. If they would have read the church
[2:01:19] age book, they would have seen it way
[2:01:21] back 40 years ago.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Even though the people did not envision
[2:01:27] it that way. This is so because in
[2:01:30] Revelation 17:3-6, it states that the
[2:01:33] horror mystery Babylon is seated on the
[2:01:36] beast and she is controlling she is
[2:01:39] controlling the last or fourth empire.
[2:01:42] And this Roman church is doing that with
[2:01:45] the world church system. World church
[2:01:48] system under uh world church system
[2:01:52] under her. Rome will be controlling and
[2:01:55] this image church system will be the
[2:01:58] will be obedient to Rome because Rome
[2:02:01] controls the gold of the world.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; She controls the gold of the world. So
[2:02:08] now the whole uh church system, well how
[2:02:11] does that affect us as believers?
[2:02:14] Well, maybe in some minor way at this
[2:02:17] point, but if you just go across this
[2:02:21] audience right here and all who are
[2:02:22] streaming and everything else
[2:02:25] and tally up
[2:02:29] the weight and burden
[2:02:32] that you go through
[2:02:34] economically speaking,
[2:02:37] you can thank Rome for most of it.
[2:02:41] That's the truth.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; You'll say, "Well, you know, I I just
[2:02:45] have a I I just have a Bank of America
[2:02:47] card. I just have this or I'm just
[2:02:48] paying this mortgage." But way beyond
[2:02:51] the realm of your vision
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; is a is a a a power
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; who's controlling and manipulating and
[2:03:02] doing these things. And you're just down
[2:03:04] here. We're just surfs.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. We're just little people
[2:03:07] down here at the end of the line and
[2:03:09] we're just working for our paycheck.
[2:03:11] Whatever more you, that's what I'm
[2:03:13] saying today. You don't have any control
[2:03:15] over the economics. You don't have any
[2:03:16] control over the taxes. You don't have
[2:03:18] any control over what's taken off here.
[2:03:20] In fact, is all we are here. We're we're
[2:03:23] just in in servitude in a sense. So that
[2:03:26] is why we need the Holy Spirit to direct
[2:03:30] us because as far as the world is
[2:03:32] concerned, they can just cause that to
[2:03:34] evaporate in a few moments. or a few
[2:03:36] days. I think two three days ago, the
[2:03:40] first thing on the news is that the
[2:03:42] stock market in the United States and in
[2:03:44] Canada was in a complete free fall and
[2:03:47] they were going to issue and stop the
[2:03:49] trading. I never heard of that in
[2:03:52] America. Never heard of that in in in
[2:03:54] Canada that that these countries part of
[2:03:57] the G8 system that system big trading
[2:04:01] system they're going to stop because uh
[2:04:03] the whole bottom had fell out of our
[2:04:06] economy.
[2:04:09] Iceland as a nation was going to declare
[2:04:11] bankruptcy as a whole nation. You know
[2:04:14] friends,
[2:04:17] like brother Brandham said to this man
[2:04:21] that tried to give him one and a half
[2:04:22] million. My wife and I were talking
[2:04:24] about it today
[2:04:26] over the breakfast table. Tried to give
[2:04:28] brother Brandham a million and a half
[2:04:30] dollars. Brother Brandham told me in
[2:04:31] detail himself how the two men came to
[2:04:36] his door and they said, "Do you know Mr.
[2:04:40] So and so?" And he said, "Yes, I do."
[2:04:42] said, 'I believe his wife was healed
[2:04:44] from cancer. They said, ' That's
[2:04:45] correct. In California.
[2:04:48] They said, 'Well, we're here
[2:04:52] because we have to Can you identify who
[2:04:54] you are? And at first, he thought, is
[2:04:56] something wrong? Is something wrong with
[2:04:57] Billy Paul? Is something happened? No.
[2:04:59] Said nothing's happened. Nothing's
[2:05:01] wrong. We just need to
[2:05:04] ensure ourselves that we're talking to
[2:05:06] the right person. So, he said, "Well, I
[2:05:08] have my minister card or whatever." They
[2:05:10] said, "They'll be fine." And so he
[2:05:12] identified himself and he said he said,
[2:05:14] "But what what's wrong?" No, they said,
[2:05:15] "We're here just to uh we're here to see
[2:05:19] first that we have the right person and
[2:05:20] then to u notify you that you've been
[2:05:24] given a million half dollars." Oh, he
[2:05:27] said, "I I wouldn't even know what to do
[2:05:29] with a million half dollars." He said,
[2:05:31] "It would just drive me crazy. I
[2:05:33] wouldn't know what to do with that.
[2:05:34] Million half back then is probably 15
[2:05:36] million today."
[2:05:38] They said, "I wouldn't know what to do
[2:05:40] with a million and a half." No. They
[2:05:41] said, "Uh, they said it's already in
[2:05:44] your account. It's already we just have
[2:05:47] a letter saying that, you know, we have
[2:05:50] to notify you. You can go to the bank
[2:05:52] and and do whatever you want to do." And
[2:05:55] he sent them back. He said, "Go back."
[2:05:57] And thank the man very much, but he
[2:05:59] says, "I cannot accept it." He said in
[2:06:02] another little thing that we were
[2:06:04] reading this morning, his brother Howard
[2:06:06] said, "Take it. you should receive that
[2:06:09] check. The man wanted to give him this
[2:06:11] check and he he told this man or the man
[2:06:14] told him he said when they were talking
[2:06:17] about this million and a half dollars.
[2:06:19] He said, "You see those mountains way
[2:06:22] over there?" Brother Bam said, "Yeah."
[2:06:25] He said, "Do you know how far that is?"
[2:06:26] He said, "No, sir, I don't." He said,
[2:06:28] "That's 80 miles."
[2:06:31] He said, "And over those mountains I own
[2:06:34] grazing land for my cattle up to those
[2:06:37] mountains and over those mountains and
[2:06:39] on the other side."
[2:06:42] And Brother Brandham looked at that and
[2:06:43] he said, "Well, you know, that's a lot."
[2:06:47] He said, "Is it looking that way?" And
[2:06:49] then he looked up. He said, "How much do
[2:06:51] you have up there?"
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; And he admitted himself. He didn't know
[2:06:58] if he had anything up there.
[2:07:01] He said, "I have a I have a mansion up
[2:07:03] there.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; That is my home up there.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; That's where my treasure is up there."
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Just give me a couple more minutes and
[2:07:15] then I'm going to close. He says, "With
[2:07:18] great power the church systems will
[2:07:20] persecute the true bride."
[2:07:23] You know
[2:07:27] sometimes little things if if I just
[2:07:29] tell you it doesn't mean anything to
[2:07:31] maybe very much to us but it might have
[2:07:34] caused someone else a whole lot of agony
[2:07:36] and a great deal of consternation.
[2:07:39] Sister Leah Barios
[2:07:42] had a place all picked for their wedding
[2:07:46] and you know the strain of a wedding and
[2:07:48] everything else and they're unable to
[2:07:49] have it here because brother Simeon
[2:07:52] can't come across the border just at
[2:07:53] this time. So they're having it down
[2:07:56] there.
[2:07:57] Nazarene church. Nice Nazarene people.
[2:08:01] Brother Tony just preached for in a
[2:08:03] Nazarene church over there and they're
[2:08:05] done with him also.
[2:08:08] this Naz Nazarene church. They agreed to
[2:08:11] it and the wedding's going to take
[2:08:13] place, but they go on the website and
[2:08:15] find our church and Bible way Bible
[2:08:19] believers and notified her. No,
[2:08:22] they can't have the wedding there
[2:08:25] because of who we are.
[2:08:30] Do you know one of our young ladies
[2:08:33] was walking with a couple other ladies
[2:08:38] in a big mall down in Burnaby. Now, you
[2:08:41] see, I'm going way back from thousands
[2:08:43] or a couple thousand years, but right to
[2:08:45] today. They're walking this last week
[2:08:48] and they're going to have something to
[2:08:49] eat and they decide, well, they go to a
[2:08:52] restaurant, no, and they looked another
[2:08:53] restaurant. No, and they they looked at
[2:08:55] this one. No. And then they went back
[2:08:57] and finally decided, well, they'll go to
[2:08:58] this one. So they go in and the only
[2:09:01] place o open, you know, a couple men
[2:09:03] sitting over here and and so they sat
[2:09:05] here and and had something to eat.
[2:09:09] They got up to leave and just as they
[2:09:11] were going by,
[2:09:14] one man says, "Clanam."
[2:09:18] And this sister, you don't hardly get
[2:09:20] very many words out of her. She turned
[2:09:23] right around and put her hands on the
[2:09:25] table and she said, "Not clan Christian.
[2:09:30] Well, oh well, you know, they didn't
[2:09:33] want to be abusive, but they said,
[2:09:34] "Well, well, but but it is a clan." No,
[2:09:36] he said, she said, "It's not a clan.
[2:09:38] It's Christian."
[2:09:41] And she was very adamant and bearing
[2:09:43] down on him. It's Christian. Then they
[2:09:45] began to, you know, backpedal. Well, you
[2:09:47] know, then one fell says, "Well, you
[2:09:49] know," he says, uh, well, I'm a Jew, but
[2:09:51] I'm not a very good one.
[2:09:56] And this fellow one the other guy says
[2:10:01] Chillowak.
[2:10:03] She said no.
[2:10:05] Abbottzford. She said no.
[2:10:08] Cloverdale. He says Brham. She said
[2:10:11] yeah. What's wrong? What's wrong with
[2:10:13] having a prophet?
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; And this guy says, well actually he says
[2:10:20] I've been to your church.
[2:10:22] Oh, you have? Yeah. He says, "My parents
[2:10:24] are good friends of Brother Burkheart
[2:10:26] and Sister Doris." He says, "And I came
[2:10:29] in church and sat." Do you know who it
[2:10:30] is? I I came in your church and I sat
[2:10:33] beside them.
[2:10:36] So he knew. Do you think that was an
[2:10:37] accident?
[2:10:39] There's a clan. God bless our sister.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Karen Ashdown says, "No, not a clan.
[2:10:45] Christians, I say the Holy Ghost came on
[2:10:48] top of her." And give those two men
[2:10:50] something to answer to on the other
[2:10:52] side.
[2:10:54] So what is the door closed? Yeah, door
[2:10:56] was closed. Slam and slammed shut in the
[2:10:58] last 2 three days to our sister send her
[2:11:01] scrambling to find another place. And
[2:11:03] this message today might might cause
[2:11:05] this door to be slammed. Whatever it is,
[2:11:07] whatever it takes,
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; it's still the truth.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; And then I'm going to close with this.
[2:11:25] in the this is still in the Philadelphia
[2:11:27] church age
[2:11:29] said before the antichrist in person
[2:11:32] takes over. He said with this great
[2:11:35] power the church system will persecute
[2:11:36] the true bride and this image will try
[2:11:39] to keep the bride from preaching and
[2:11:41] teaching. Her ministers will be
[2:11:44] forbidden to give comfort and truth to
[2:11:47] the people who need it. I have been kept
[2:11:49] out of the prison. I cannot be part of
[2:11:54] the visiting people at the hospitals
[2:11:58] because it has to be someone who's part
[2:12:01] of the ecumenical system
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; that's already that's been in place for
[2:12:05] a long time.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Do you know you say, "Well, I wasn't
[2:12:10] aware of that." You're not aware of a
[2:12:12] lot of things.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? You're under the
[2:12:15] protection of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; We are under the protection of the Holy
[2:12:21] Spirit. If we had to be subjected to,
[2:12:24] you know, if if the Holy Spirit pulled
[2:12:26] back his protection, you'd find there
[2:12:29] would be real severe God has protected
[2:12:32] you.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; He's protected us.
[2:12:39] He said before the antichrist in person
[2:12:42] takes over this complete world system of
[2:12:44] churches, the true church will be taken
[2:12:47] away from this world to be with the
[2:12:50] Lord. God will catch away his bride for
[2:12:53] the great marriage supper of the lamb.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; That's where my home is.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; He went on to say, he says, I will keep
[2:13:04] thee. He quotes the scripture. And I'm
[2:13:06] just closing right now in a couple
[2:13:08] minutes. I will keep thee from the hour
[2:13:10] of temptation which shall come upon all
[2:13:13] the world to try them that dwell upon
[2:13:16] the earth. That's scripture revelation.
[2:13:19] He said this verse is not a declaration
[2:13:21] that the true church will go into and
[2:13:24] through the tribulation. If it meant
[2:13:26] that, it would have said that. But it
[2:13:29] said, I will keep thee from
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; the hour of temptation. Hallelujah.
[2:13:36] This temptation is exactly like the
[2:13:38] temptation in Eden.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; That's why I read it. This temptation is
[2:13:45] exactly like the temptation in Eden. And
[2:13:48] the temptation was is is this holding
[2:13:51] you back? You can't earn what you you
[2:13:53] can't fellowship with who you want to.
[2:13:55] You don't have the kind of friends. You
[2:13:57] don't have the kind of you don't have
[2:13:58] the kind of enjoyment. You're you're
[2:14:00] held back. You're restricted. You can't
[2:14:02] really, you know, to some of some of
[2:14:04] women, and this is common, you got
[2:14:06] talents that that are you're being held
[2:14:08] back from, and you need to be able to
[2:14:11] have that freedom. It's a trap.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Excuse me for getting,
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; but it is a trap
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; to throw yourself out into the into the
[2:14:22] marketplace, as it were. Oh, God, help
[2:14:25] us
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; to keep you from the hour of temptation.
[2:14:28] He said the same one that was in Eden.
[2:14:30] He says, "And it will be a very inviting
[2:14:33] proposition held up in direct opposition
[2:14:37] to God's commanded word. And yet from
[2:14:40] the standpoint of human reasoning, it
[2:14:42] will be so very right, so enlightening
[2:14:46] and lifegiving as to fool the world.
[2:14:49] Only the very elect will not be fooled.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; The temptation will come as follows."
[2:14:56] Isn't this amazing? This is more up
[2:14:58] to-date than tomorrow morning's
[2:15:00] newspaper.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; God through his prophet knew exactly
[2:15:04] what was going to happen to the whole
[2:15:06] economic system, the whole all the
[2:15:08] subtilities of Satan in this world. And
[2:15:11] it doesn't matter whether you're a young
[2:15:12] fellow sitting here on the front seat,
[2:15:14] young ladies or or or families or
[2:15:16] whatever more or aged. It's all the
[2:15:18] same. Only the elect will not be fooled.
[2:15:20] And the temptation will come as follows.
[2:15:22] The ecumenical move. See how the
[2:15:25] temptation will come as follows. He ties
[2:15:27] it right to the church,
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; the church system.
[2:15:31] The ecumenical move that has that has
[2:15:34] started on what seems such a beautiful
[2:15:36] and blessed principle fulfilling
[2:15:38] Christ's prayer that we all might be one
[2:15:40] becomes so strong politically
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; that she bears pressure upon the
[2:15:46] government to cause listen it's very
[2:15:49] close to cause the government to cause
[2:15:52] all to join with her either directly or
[2:15:57] through adherence to principles in acted
[2:16:01] into law so that no people will be
[2:16:04] recognized as actual churches unless
[2:16:07] under direct or indirect domination of
[2:16:11] the council.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; So we say well this church is over here
[2:16:15] and church is over there and all these
[2:16:17] various churches
[2:16:20] the masters
[2:16:22] of those churches
[2:16:25] want mastery and control of the entire
[2:16:28] system.
[2:16:30] So as
[2:16:32] I can tell you friends,
[2:16:35] it it becomes so subtle and they have
[2:16:39] enacted enacted laws that are in direct
[2:16:44] violation to the message.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to say to you, who are you
[2:16:48] going to bow to?
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Who is going to be your God?
[2:16:57] Amen.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; My God
[2:17:00] is God.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; My God
[2:17:06] is a living God.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; And I will not bow to a system or some
[2:17:12] other order that is going to control my
[2:17:15] life and tell me how I will serve God or
[2:17:19] how I will worship or who I can
[2:17:21] fellowship with or who I can't
[2:17:22] fellowship with.
[2:17:24] Our God
[2:17:27] has already informed us and we're well
[2:17:29] informed. Excuse me for taking as much
[2:17:32] time as I have today. But I this is the
[2:17:35] hunger that I have in my heart. Why do
[2:17:38] you hunger?
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Why do you thirst?
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; It's because the father
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; is trying to reveal himself to you.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Don't serve all these other gods. And
[2:17:52] there's a multitude of them.
[2:17:55] Amen.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; I know you're listening to me. I know
[2:17:57] some some of you may be having a hard
[2:17:59] time accepting or acknowledging it.
[2:18:03] Listen, just believe it.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Just believe it. And a year down the
[2:18:07] road, if it doesn't work for you, well
[2:18:09] then you can come and call me a nasty
[2:18:11] person. But I can tell you one thing.
[2:18:14] What that messenger wrote was for us
[2:18:16] today.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; What God spoke through him 40 years ago,
[2:18:19] 45 years ago, is for us right now at
[2:18:22] this time. Amen.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your kind attention. Let's
[2:18:31] just bow our heads in prayer. Father, we
[2:18:35] have been
[2:18:36] so
[2:18:38] instructed, so informed,
[2:18:42] and you have pricricked our hearts.
[2:18:45] We know these words are true. And now
[2:18:48] I'm asking oh Lord that you will take
[2:18:51] the words that have been spoken and let
[2:18:53] them let it be a light upon the path and
[2:18:56] upon the way.
[2:18:58] I pray that you will guide oh God the
[2:19:02] thoughts and the decisions of the
[2:19:03] people. You will guide them. Give them
[2:19:07] the discernment discerning of spirits.
[2:19:10] Lord I pray that they will have such a
[2:19:12] keen discernment. Let them know, Father,
[2:19:17] what what what we shall do day by day.
[2:19:19] And as your messenger has said, we just
[2:19:22] have a light upon perhaps the next
[2:19:24] footstep, but you're the one that guides
[2:19:26] us. And we're so thankful for it. Lord,
[2:19:29] I ask you to your blessings upon this
[2:19:32] congregation of people and all that are
[2:19:36] uh streaming, whatever country, whatever
[2:19:38] part of the world, whatever time of the
[2:19:40] day it is. I ask oh father that you will
[2:19:43] enter the room where they are oh God and
[2:19:46] let your presence father and let your
[2:19:49] presence be our portion in Jesus
[2:19:51] Christ's name and whatever need lord
[2:19:54] there may be some that are facing great
[2:19:56] and critical decisions at this time
[2:19:59] some things that are coming up in their
[2:20:01] in their immediate future I pray that
[2:20:04] you will help them father help them in
[2:20:06] the name of Jesus Christ someone may be
[2:20:09] in troubled waters I pray you'll still
[2:20:12] waters for them, Lord, in Jesus Christ's
[2:20:14] name. Someone may be suffering
[2:20:17] physically. I pray that you will heal
[2:20:19] them for healing as part of our
[2:20:22] redemptive the redemption price at
[2:20:24] Calvary. Thank you, Father, in Jesus
[2:20:28] Christ's name. Amen.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll have you stand with me and I
[2:20:32] want to I want to uh sing uh I will
[2:20:36] praise him. I just had that in my heart
[2:20:39] since the before the service. It's 6:05
[2:20:43] and
[2:20:46] [Music]
[2:20:56] I saw
[2:20:59] I saw the cleansing fountain.
[2:21:04] [Music]
[2:21:06] Open
[2:21:09] wide for all my sins.
[2:21:16] I
[2:21:18] obey the spirit.
[2:21:25] When he said will come,
[2:21:30] let's give him what he's worthy of.
[2:21:34] I
[2:21:36] will praise him.
[2:21:39] I
[2:21:40] will praise him.
[2:21:43] Praise
[2:21:45] the lamb for sinners slain
[2:21:54] him. Glory
[2:22:00] for his blood.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Notice these words.
[2:22:11] How
[2:22:12] the way seems straight and narrow.
[2:22:18] [Music]
[2:22:20] Oh,
[2:22:22] my clay was swept away.
[2:22:29] My
[2:22:31] ambition
[2:22:33] and wishing.
[2:22:36] [Music]
[2:22:46] Oh, I
[2:22:48] will praise him.
[2:22:51] I
[2:22:53] will praise him.
[2:22:56] Praise
[2:22:58] the Lord for sinners.
[2:23:05] King
[2:23:07] in glory all the people
[2:23:13] for his blood has washed away.
[2:23:21] Then God's fire then God's fire on the
[2:23:29] altar of our heart. Oh yes, Lord.
[2:23:33] My heart was set a flame.
[2:23:38] [Music]
[2:23:40] I
[2:23:42] shall never cease to praise him.
[2:23:49] Glory, glory to his name.
[2:23:56] [Music]
[2:23:59] I will praise him.
[2:24:03] I
[2:24:05] will praise him.
[2:24:07] Praise
[2:24:09] the lamb for
[2:24:16] our king.
[2:24:18] Glory all the people.
[2:24:24] For his blood has washed away
[2:24:29] each s.
[2:24:31] And before we sing the fourth verse, I'm
[2:24:34] going to ask our brother Moan if you'll
[2:24:36] come down and offer prayer to the people
[2:24:38] or brother Moan and ask God's
[2:24:42] Holy Spirit to make
[2:24:47] these words locked in your memory. And
[2:24:50] I'm praying that God, I need direction.
[2:24:53] I need guidance every day. You all can
[2:24:56] pray for me. If you don't have anyone to
[2:24:58] pray for, pray for me. We just need that
[2:25:00] direction. But I know as time goes on,
[2:25:03] you talk about the squeeze, that's what
[2:25:06] you're experiencing. That's what you
[2:25:08] will experience. More of a squeeze. More
[2:25:11] of a squeeze. That's the whole design.
[2:25:14] But the prophet said it way ahead of
[2:25:16] time. So don't get don't get discouraged
[2:25:19] when you're in the middle of it. It will
[2:25:22] happen. That's the way it is ordained.
[2:25:24] But the God that I serve
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; is greater
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; than any God.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; And he has made you the head
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; and not the tail.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; You'll not go hungry.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; You'll not go hungry.
[2:25:48] Amen.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Never saw God's children baking bread.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:55] [Music]
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; You'll have enough and more.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He'll guide you.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; He knows the future. Young man, young
[2:26:05] ladies, he knows your future. He'll open
[2:26:08] doors where they never thought there was
[2:26:10] a door.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; He can drop food on the plate from
[2:26:15] heaven.
[2:26:18] We want to please him.
[2:26:21] [Music]
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; When you're sick,
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; he's our father.
[2:26:28] [Music]
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; I've enjoyed wonderful health.
[2:26:34] Wonderful health. And I never found that
[2:26:37] I had to beg him for it.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Just received it.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; And thank him for it.
[2:26:45] That's what you want to do.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; All right, the last verse. We'll sing
[2:26:50] it.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; Blessed
[2:26:54] be the name of Jesus.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful name.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; So glad he took me.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? He took us in. Oh,
[2:27:11] he
[2:27:13] forgiven
[2:27:14] all my friends.
[2:27:18] [Music]
[2:27:20] He has cleansed my heart from
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have so much to thank him for.
[2:27:29] Oh, I
[2:27:31] will praise him.
[2:27:34] I
[2:27:36] will praise him.
[2:27:39] Praise
[2:27:41] the Lamb.
[2:27:52] [Music]
[2:27:58] has washed away.
[2:28:01] [Music]
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; Shall we pray?
[2:28:07] Aba Father,
[2:28:10] my God,
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; my Lord,
[2:28:15] we heard your son praying, Father.
[2:28:19] We saw how we personalized his
[2:28:21] relationship with the father
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; and he said, "My Lord and my God."
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:28:29] Father, we have been placed in that
[2:28:32] position today.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Where we could relate to you as your
[2:28:36] children.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; We can relate to you as sons and
[2:28:41] daughters of God
[2:28:43] whom you have washed with your blood
[2:28:46] whom you have bought a second time from
[2:28:49] the pawn shop. Whom you have redeemed
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Yes.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; With the price of your own blood.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; What it cost you, Father, to redeem
[2:28:59] these children today.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; We stand in your presence, Lord. Once
[2:29:03] again,
[2:29:05] we thank you for the words that have
[2:29:07] been spoken from this pulpit.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; We thank you for the message that has
[2:29:12] gone forth throughout the earth today
[2:29:15] from here.
[2:29:17] Father, we thank you that you have been
[2:29:20] amongst us. Your presence is with us.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Regardless of the times that we are
[2:29:27] living in,
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; you taught us that this will come upon
[2:29:31] us.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; We saw that events have triggered
[2:29:36] Lord. Years ago, what we are
[2:29:38] experiencing today,
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; you told us that a squeeze will come.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; And you said for us to prepare.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Prepare and make sure that we know you.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. whom to know is life eternal.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, may this knowledge that you
[2:29:56] require of us unfold in a greater
[2:29:59] measure today. For if we know you and we
[2:30:02] can hold your hands and you can hold on
[2:30:04] to us, Father, then we will be that
[2:30:06] invincible army
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; that you promise will come upon this
[2:30:10] earth that we will not be moved. We will
[2:30:12] not be shaken. This Eve will not go down
[2:30:16] like the first Eve. This is the eve that
[2:30:19] you have predestinated to come. The eve
[2:30:22] will that will not be broken.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; A people that will not be defeated.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; An army of the living God that will not
[2:30:29] be shaken.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you that this word has
[2:30:34] been committed to us.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; This word lies in our hearts this
[2:30:38] morning.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we pray that we will not
[2:30:42] disappoint you.
[2:30:45] We will not bring shame and reproach to
[2:30:47] you, Father.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; But we will stand, Lord Jesus,
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; as the people that you will be proud of,
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; when you challenge the enemy and said,
[2:30:56] "How dust thy consider my servant Job?"
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, this morning we could stand
[2:31:01] before you
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; as such a people
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; to make you proud, Father.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; We seek your glory. We seek your honor.
[2:31:11] Forgive us for the ways we have let you
[2:31:14] down. Give us strength to go again.
[2:31:17] And now, Father, as we depart one from
[2:31:19] another, we pray that you would take us
[2:31:22] to our homes in peace and safety. Bring
[2:31:25] us again and send the word of light.
[2:31:27] Father, that we may be able to walk in
