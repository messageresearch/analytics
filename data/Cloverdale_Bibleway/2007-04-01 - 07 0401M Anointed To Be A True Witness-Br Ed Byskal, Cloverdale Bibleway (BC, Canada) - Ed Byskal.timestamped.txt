[0:00] There's a land that is fairer than day.
[0:06] And by faith we can see it all.
[0:12] For the father who waits over the way
[0:18] to prepare us a dwelling place
[0:24] in the sea
[0:27] by
[0:30] we shall be on that
[0:34] Oh,
[0:37] in the sea
[0:39] thall.
[0:48] Oh, we shall sing on that beautiful
[0:52] show.
[0:55] The glorious
[1:01] and the spirit shall sorrow
[1:08] for blessing
[1:13] in the sweet.
[1:19] He shall be on that beautiful sh
[1:25] in the sea
[1:28] by
[1:31] we shall be on that beautiful soul
[1:37] to our fle
[1:43] we will offer our pray of praise.
[1:49] For the glorious
[1:51] kingom is
[1:55] and the blessing
[2:01] in the sweet
[2:04] by
[2:07] we shall be on the
[2:10] show
[2:13] in the sweet
[2:16] I And
[2:19] we shall be on that beautiful shore.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Going to be there.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; I'd like to also sing number 468.
[2:35] Had it not been, you know, the only way
[2:37] we could we could get to that shore is
[2:40] because of our Lord that died for us.
[2:44] just reading in in the family altar, I
[2:46] guess it was. Brother Brandon was
[2:48] saying, "Well, I I sure wouldn't want to
[2:50] try and get to heaven on our own
[2:51] merits." And it was something actually
[2:53] to hear him say, "Wouldn't want to try
[2:55] and get to heaven on my preaching. I
[2:56] wouldn't want to try to get to heaven on
[2:58] my visions." I thought, "Well, if if he
[3:00] couldn't do it, how how are we ever
[3:02] going to how are we ever going to see
[3:04] that land? It's it's only through
[3:05] Christ." Amen. So, that's why we come
[3:07] this morning. Just focus on him.
[3:10] Let's all stand as we sing it.
[3:13] Oh, had it not been for a place called
[3:18] Mount of Calvary,
[3:22] had it not
[3:31] been for
[3:35] Jesus
[3:39] and forever
[3:41] my soul. Glor
[4:08] of Jesus.
[4:12] And forever
[4:14] my soul
[4:22] for
[4:29] Happy
[4:38] for
[4:41] Jesus
[4:44] and forever
[4:47] my soul.
[4:52] I am redeemed
[4:57] with a power. Oh Jesus
[5:03] has changed my whole life.
[5:09] If anybody
[5:14] just
[5:15] I am
[5:18] telling
[5:20] I am
[5:26] I
[5:48] just
[5:50] I am
[5:54] I am
[6:00] I am
[6:05] my will.
[6:09] Jesus
[6:11] has changed my whole life.
[6:17] If anybody
[6:20] asks you
[6:22] just who I am
[6:26] telling
[6:28] I am.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask at this time if brother
[6:37] David Bernoff you'd come and lead us in
[6:39] a word of prayer. Amen. We're so glad we
[6:42] can approach the throne of God and with
[6:44] that on our lips we are redeemed. Amen.
[6:46] we can come boldly in his presence this
[6:48] morning. Brother Dave, if you comeless,
[6:54] let's bow our heads.
[6:58] Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful, Lord,
[7:00] that I can lift up my voice and say, I
[7:02] am redeemed, Father.
[7:05] And the prophet of God's taught us that
[7:07] our body will come subject to our
[7:09] confession, Lord.
[7:11] We confess this morning, Lord, that we
[7:13] are redeemed by the blood of the lamb,
[7:15] Lord.
[7:17] &gt;&gt; And Father, we like our brother was
[7:20] saying earlier, we know it's not on our
[7:22] merits, Lord Jesus. If there's a word
[7:25] that just keeps getting bigger and
[7:27] bigger to me, Father, and it's grace,
[7:30] &gt;&gt; grace, grace, grace, Father,
[7:33] Lord, we realize none of us are going to
[7:35] make it in this flesh, Lord. It's it's
[7:38] solely trusting in the work of Calvary,
[7:41] Father.
[7:43] And yet, Lord, we want to do what we can
[7:45] in this life to live a life worthy of
[7:47] the gospel, Father.
[7:50] So, Lord, we're here to hear your word
[7:52] once more. We pray that you will bless
[7:54] your servant who's waited on you. We've
[7:57] tried to prepare our own hearts, Father.
[7:58] We're we want to enter your courts with
[8:01] praise and thanksgiving because you are
[8:03] worthy, Lord.
[8:05] So bless us in divine presence.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; Take this meeting under your divine
[8:10] control Lord and let no one go out of
[8:13] this building without feeling the touch
[8:14] of God in their lives. We I pray father
[8:18] in Jesus name. Amen.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time before we have our
[8:25] seats. I am
[8:28] redeemed.
[8:30] Heat. Heat.
[8:40] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[8:51] I am

[9:00] Amen. You can have your seats. Sister

[9:06] special for us this morning. If she'd
[9:07] come at this time.
[9:12] Want to greet everyone that's here and
[9:13] those that are joining with us on the
[9:16] internet and on the phone hookup. God
[9:17] bless you.

[9:24] Brother Tim and Susan Hoffer are proud
[9:26] to announce the engagement of their
[9:28] children, Sister Stephanie Manard and

[9:32] them.

[19:30] last day. I'm on my way. I'm down for

[21:18] Hallelujah. I'm save
[21:23] my wonderful way.
[21:28] I'm glad I found now he could bring me
[21:32] out and show me the way.
[21:37] For a long time I tra
[21:46] my heart was so heavy and I said go
[21:53] then I heard about Jesus
[21:58] wonderful
[22:02] I found out he could bring me
[22:07] his saving power.
[22:10] Oh, thank God. Thank God I am free. I'm
[22:14] free. Free of this world of sin.
[22:21] I've been washed in the blood of Jesus.
[22:25] I've been born again.
[22:29] Hallelujah.
[22:33] In my wonderful way,
[22:38] I'm glad I bow down the rain.
[22:43] Show me your way.
[22:48] Like a bird out of prison
[22:52] has taken its flight.
[22:57] like climb and that God gave back his
[23:01] son
[23:04] like
[23:09] fortune and
[23:13] I
[23:15] found out how he could bring me out to
[23:18] his holy name.
[23:22] Thank God I am free.
[23:27] We
[23:29] s
[23:35] Jesus be born again.
[23:40] Hallelujah. Save
[23:45] by wonderful grace.
[23:52] He will bring me out. Show me the way.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; Glad to be in the house of God.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come with expectation.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Then God will certainly see that you're
[24:11] not disappointed.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; If you put in for a small order, that's
[24:15] what you get.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; But we ask largely,
[24:19] &gt;&gt; then that's what we'll get. Amen. God
[24:22] bless you. You may be seated.
[24:26] I'm just going to make a couple of uh
[24:29] announcements. First, the deacons have
[24:31] asked me to
[24:33] uh make more clear regarding the
[24:39] um announcement which we made uh
[24:42] regarding prayer requests rather than
[24:45] bringing them here and having us read
[24:47] them. Uh but they wanted to know and I
[24:50] guess there were some questions to them.
[24:53] Are are the people that are not well
[24:55] here able to be prayed for? Oh my
[24:56] goodness. Absolutely. That's what we're
[24:59] here for. And you're come and be prayed
[25:02] for. All it was was concerning long
[25:05] writtenout requests and we're reading
[25:07] them and reading them service after
[25:09] service. So we said that bring a cloth.
[25:12] Bring an anointed cloth. bring a bring
[25:15] something that you would like to have
[25:16] prayed over and we'll pray for it here.
[25:19] And uh
[25:21] I I think maybe just writing out a
[25:23] request comes a lot easier.
[25:26] And uh I I noticed since we made that
[25:30] request, we haven't had a single
[25:31] handkerchief.
[25:34] And that's what the Bible says. So, if
[25:36] you if you're really burdened and you
[25:39] really want to have somebody prayed for
[25:40] that's not here, you'd like to send
[25:43] something to them and have them have
[25:45] have a a cloth or anointed cloth prayed
[25:48] for over, then that's what we'll do
[25:50] here. Because I noticed brother Brandham
[25:52] says on the tapes, we've got all these
[25:54] anointed. We got these claws and these
[25:56] handkerchiefs and aprons and whatever
[25:58] more and they took from the bodies of
[26:00] the apostles and and gave those claws
[26:03] and people were healed. And so I just
[26:06] want to go back to the pattern. I think
[26:09] that's fine. I really think that's fine.
[26:11] When we were a lot smaller and it is
[26:13] actually this isn't this isn't anything
[26:15] sudden at all. has been really on my
[26:17] mind for a long time. And I'm rather
[26:19] slow to move and do things sometimes.
[26:22] But Moses was slow. Brother Brandham
[26:25] said he was slow. So I'm in good
[26:26] company.
[26:29] We'll all be slow a wee bit. Don't want
[26:32] to be too slow preaching. However, we
[26:34] take too much time. Uh so I hope that
[26:38] that is clear. We we're just happy to
[26:40] pray with anybody that's here physically
[26:43] that's not well. You feel free as always
[26:47] to come and be prayed for. And this is
[26:50] the house of deliverance. Not only a
[26:53] house of worship, a house of
[26:54] deliverance. And I quite frankly am a
[26:56] very firm believer that he confirmed his
[27:00] word with signs following. And if the
[27:03] word is being preached, you should
[27:05] expect an answer from God. Don't come
[27:09] here not expecting to receive from God.
[27:12] You should come expecting to receive
[27:15] whatever your need is. Amen.
[27:23] Going to be turning to the word in a few
[27:25] minutes, but there's a verse of a a
[27:27] song, a very common song at Calvary,
[27:31] which we all know. And uh
[27:37] uh the last verse, we're just going to
[27:39] sing the chorus and the last verse. And
[27:41] then the chorus,
[27:43] the last verse says, "Oh, the love that
[27:46] drew salvation's plan.
[27:50] Oh, the grace that brought it down to
[27:54] man.
[27:56] Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span at
[28:00] Calvary."
[28:02] And we're coming up to Easter now.
[28:05] We got a flyer in the mail and perhaps
[28:07] you did too. It was from Jehovah's
[28:09] Witnesses.
[28:10] And they were making a an announcement.
[28:13] The greatest man, the death of the
[28:15] greatest man that ever lived. And I had
[28:18] glanced it over, but they didn't say
[28:19] anything about his resurrection.
[28:23] Might have something to do with what
[28:24] they believe. I don't know. I have some
[28:27] pretty good idea. But we're not
[28:29] celebrating
[28:31] a death only. We're celebrating a
[28:33] resurrection.
[28:34] We're not just not just the death, but
[28:37] it's the life that we're celebrating.
[28:39] And it was a life it was a body that
[28:42] couldn't corrupt.
[28:44] It was a life that couldn't stay in the
[28:46] tomb.
[28:48] And it's a life that's been passed on.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, the love that drew
[28:56] salvation's plan. And oh, the grace that
[29:00] brought it down to man. This is very,
[29:02] very much in line with what I want to
[29:04] speak about today. And so, I've got to
[29:06] try to capture capture your thoughts
[29:09] early. Would ask you to be very focused
[29:13] and for me, help me. All right, you do
[29:16] that. It'll really help me. God bless
[29:18] your brother Tony. Haven't even been
[29:19] shaking brother Tony's hands at Rebecca
[29:22] since I've been back. And
[29:26] Amen.
[29:27] Nice to have everybody here.
[29:36] Oh, the love that through salvation
[29:40] plan.
[29:42] Oh, the grace that brought it down to
[29:46] land.
[29:48] Oh, the might of God is
[29:54] at
[30:01] mercy.
[30:03] There was great and grace was free.
[30:09] And there was multip
[30:24] we sing the last verse once again. All
[30:28] the love from salvation
[30:31] plan.
[30:33] Oh
[30:36] down to earth
[30:40] mighty
[30:42] God.
[30:54] Grace was free.
[30:59] There was multip
[31:16] Let's thank him, shall we?
[31:19] How gracious, how wonderful you are,
[31:22] Lord.
[31:24] We're thinking of this time of the year
[31:26] especially, Lord,
[31:29] the time of you entering in and the
[31:32] people were praising and worshiping and
[31:35] throwing their garments down, waving
[31:39] palms and a short time later crying,
[31:42] "Crucify! Crucify!"
[31:44] But there was no great voice or shouting
[31:47] except the angels rejoicing when you
[31:50] raised came out of the tomb and began to
[31:53] make yourself known. And today we're
[31:56] here to give you thanks, Lord Jesus. How
[31:59] thankful we are that you have made
[32:01] yourself known. Almighty God, by the
[32:04] Holy Spirit, you have sent the spirit of
[32:08] revelation. and you've sent the
[32:10] anointing upon us that we have been
[32:12] given eyes to see. And we thank you for
[32:15] what we see. We thank you, Lord, for the
[32:18] things that you'll still show us. And we
[32:20] pray that you will magnify yourself
[32:23] amongst us, oh God. I pray that you will
[32:26] demonstrate your power. Bind every evil
[32:29] spirit, every hindering spirit. Lord, I
[32:32] pray you'll loose, oh God, our our minds
[32:35] that seem so
[32:38] so encumbered sometime. I pray that
[32:40] you'll remove all the weights, oh God,
[32:43] and the things that so easily be
[32:45] satisfather in the name of Jesus. Give
[32:48] liberty to your word, I pray. Give
[32:50] uncction to it. Let the Holy Spirit be
[32:53] the speaker, I pray. And may each person
[32:57] receive what they have need of. Bless
[33:00] all that are with us, Father, streaming
[33:04] at this moment. May it not just be a
[33:08] stream of our my voice, but may there be
[33:11] a stream of the Holy Spirit, the very
[33:15] presence of the divine one coming into
[33:19] their rooms and into their places of
[33:21] worship. In Jesus Christ's name we ask
[33:24] it. Amen.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:27] Good morning.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; I'll invite you to take your Bibles and
[33:31] turn to John's Gospel, the first
[33:35] chapter.
[33:37] And we're going to be reading
[33:41] such a familiar scripture starting with
[33:44] verse one
[33:47] down to verse 5 and then we'll read
[33:49] verse 14. Keep your Bibles open because
[33:52] we're turning to other uh brief
[33:55] scriptures after this.
[34:00] In the beginning was the word and the
[34:03] word was with God and the word was God.
[34:08] The same was in the beginning with God.
[34:12] All things were made by him and without
[34:14] him was not anything made that was made.
[34:19] In him was life and the life was the
[34:22] light of man.
[34:24] And the light shineth in darkness, and
[34:27] the darkness comprehended it not. Down
[34:30] to verse 14.
[34:33] And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[34:36] among us, and we beheld his glory, the
[34:39] glory as of the only begotten of the
[34:42] father, full of grace and truth. Down to
[34:46] verse 18.
[34:48] No man hath seen God at any time.
[34:52] The only begotten son, which is in the
[34:55] bosom of the father, he hath declared
[34:58] him. Turn to chapter 8 if you would
[35:02] please
[35:09] and verse 42.
[35:14] Jesus said unto them,
[35:19] "If God were your father,
[35:22] you would love me, for I proceeded forth
[35:27] and came from God."
[35:30] Oh, the grace that brought it down to
[35:33] man.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; For I proceeded forth and came from God.
[35:39] Neither came I of myself,
[35:43] but he sent me.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Turn to chapter 20.
[36:10] In verse 21,
[36:14] he just showed them his hands in his
[36:16] sight after the resurrection.
[36:19] Then said Jesus to them again, "Peace be
[36:23] unto you,
[36:25] as my father hath sent me,
[36:30] even so send I you."
[36:34] And when he had said this, he breathed
[36:38] on them and said unto them, Receive ye
[36:42] the Holy Ghost as my father hath sent me
[36:47] said, I proceeded forth from God.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; And now he's saying after his
[36:54] resurrection, as my father hath sent me,
[36:59] &gt;&gt; even so send I you. And when he had said
[37:02] this,
[37:04] &gt;&gt; he breathed on them and said, "Receive
[37:07] ye the Holy Ghost. You may be seated."
[37:15] The scripture tells us also Peter
[37:17] preaching and soon after
[37:21] this experience and they'd received the
[37:23] Holy Spirit. He's telling the people how
[37:27] that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[37:31] the Holy Ghost and with power, who went
[37:34] about doing good and healing all that
[37:37] were oppressed of the devil, for God was
[37:40] with him. Whenever we read John 1,
[37:46] it always confronts a minister with a
[37:48] tremendous challenge
[37:51] because we're starting in the beginning.
[37:55] In the beginning
[37:57] was the word and from the beginning you
[38:00] can go anywhere. It's so vast. It's so
[38:05] such an expanse of of place to go. It's
[38:10] always a little bit of a challenge to
[38:13] where do we go from here in the
[38:15] beginning. But I want to I want to focus
[38:19] our thoughts because I've been speaking
[38:21] the last two Sundays
[38:24] on anointed for rapture. So I want to
[38:28] tie together I want to continue with
[38:31] this subject of anointing.
[38:34] And in the first message, I brought the
[38:39] uh process of anointing and how it was
[38:42] an eastern it was in the eastern culture
[38:46] and I I took it on the physical side and
[38:50] how the first time anointing really
[38:52] comes in. God actually referred to Jacob
[38:57] anointing or it doesn't even say he
[39:00] anointed but he poured oil upon
[39:04] the pillar that he had slept on. It was
[39:08] stones stones
[39:10] that he had made for a pillow. And it
[39:14] was at that time he had that dream and
[39:17] he saw the angels ascending and
[39:20] descending and the ladder was on earth
[39:23] but it stretched into heaven. And he had
[39:26] that dream and he was so impacted by
[39:30] that dream, so affected by that dream
[39:33] and the presence that it left him with.
[39:36] He said, "This is Bethl. This is the
[39:39] gate of heaven." and he called it Bethl
[39:43] which is a house of God. And he was so
[39:46] affected by that that was the first
[39:48] instance he made an altar or raised up
[39:52] those stones that he'd slept on and used
[39:55] as a pillow and he poured oil upon them.
[39:59] And then God later reminded him and God
[40:03] used the word the pillar that thou dst
[40:06] anoint and the and the vow that you made
[40:11] and he made the vow if you'll be with
[40:13] me. And so that was the first instance
[40:16] of the anointing. I just take you
[40:17] quickly through it. And then God told
[40:21] Moses then later now it's it's the
[40:24] abraham's children. So he told Moses,
[40:28] "Make oil and make it fragrant oil. Make
[40:33] it for anointing oil and you'll make it
[40:36] fragrant." And then later he told them,
[40:38] "Anoint the priests, the sons of Aaron."
[40:42] And then later he anoint Aaron, the high
[40:45] priest, and anoint the altar and anoint
[40:47] the things that are in the tabernacle.
[40:50] And it just began to ex expand in its
[40:53] understanding and meaning. And the
[40:55] people understood because they had used
[40:58] that they used that even in in in their
[41:01] daily life. I won't say daily life but
[41:03] they were acquainted with the act of
[41:06] anointing but now it was taking a whole
[41:08] spiritual becoming very very sacred.
[41:12] And to the Hebrews they understood that
[41:16] anointing in the sacred sense when
[41:18] something was being anointed was being
[41:21] consecrated
[41:23] and the and the fact the very act of the
[41:25] anointing upon the individual especially
[41:29] when it was on an individual. their
[41:31] understanding was, and this is really
[41:34] fundamental to the message this morning
[41:36] as it was to the last two messages, but
[41:39] I I want to really nail this down is
[41:43] because God in his people, which were
[41:45] the Hebrews, they understood that when
[41:48] something was anointed in the in another
[41:52] realm, in the divine realm, they
[41:55] understood that something from God was
[41:58] being transferred
[42:00] from the divine one to that individual.
[42:05] And so now you want to think of this
[42:07] transferral because the message this
[42:10] morning I want to consider this
[42:13] incredible transferral that from the
[42:17] beginning in the beginning was the word.
[42:20] I want to start from the beginning or
[42:23] from the eternal one
[42:27] transferal
[42:29] from him came the word in the beginning
[42:32] was the word but in the very beginning
[42:35] there there was God alone the prophet
[42:39] describes him I'm not going to spend a
[42:40] lot of time in it but he was alone God
[42:44] by himself and from him came the logos
[42:48] or the word logos simply the Greek term
[42:52] for word. And then that word came and
[42:56] was made flesh that was transferred on
[43:01] further down. Oh, the grace that brought
[43:04] it down to man. And now it's it's a
[43:07] transferral and it came on down into man
[43:11] and from Christ into spirit form and
[43:15] from spirit form into a people. It's a
[43:19] great operation that God had in his
[43:22] mind. That is the that that's why we
[43:26] have that idea or that concept of the
[43:28] anointing. And this was the concept they
[43:30] had that when something was anointed, it
[43:34] was something all the way from the
[43:35] divine one through some process that God
[43:39] had in his mind to bring it and and
[43:42] transferring something that was actually
[43:44] divine, holy, sacred to that individual.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:53] Ignatius
[43:55] say said this
[43:57] for there is one God who made himself
[44:01] manifest through Jesus Christ his son
[44:06] who is his logos proceeding from his
[44:11] silence
[44:12] saying Ignatius is bringing the thought
[44:15] that God was silent but now he brings
[44:19] forth a voice he brings forth a sound
[44:23] through Jesus Christ. This process, I
[44:26] don't know if God was silent or not, but
[44:28] that is what Ignatius had said. Jesus
[44:32] said, "I've proceeded from God." And
[44:35] when he used the word proceeded, it
[44:38] isn't just that I've come forth from God
[44:40] or that I've come forth. To proceed, we
[44:43] say, "Well, to proceed is to make
[44:45] progress, to go forward, and to have
[44:48] motion, proceed." But when Jesus used
[44:51] the word, it was not just to say that
[44:54] there was movement, but it was to
[44:57] identify where the movement commenced.
[45:00] And that is why he said, I have
[45:02] proceeded and come forth from God.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; He identified where he he came from. I
[45:11] proceeded forth and came forth from God.
[45:15] And as the Father hath sent me, so send
[45:19] I you. We are to know emphatically where
[45:23] we came from.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; We didn't originate We didn't originate
[45:29] in our mother's womb.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; We didn't originate in our father's
[45:34] sperm. We originated in the mind of God.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; We came from God. Jesus knew that. Jesus
[45:42] never identified himself. say, "I come
[45:44] from Mary's womb.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; I come from God."
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; It's a great plan, a great operation.
[45:54] I've come from God and I go to God. It
[45:58] is that I've proceeded. I have come from
[46:00] one place to another.
[46:04] I've come down.
[46:07] I've made my appearance.
[46:10] And thus Jesus was anointed. Brother
[46:12] Brandham said in and show us the father
[46:16] in Tom's service on Wednesday night. I
[46:19] was so so very blessed and I know that
[46:23] you were as well.
[46:25] And he was speaking on show us the
[46:27] father and it sufficeth us. And I
[46:30] thought it was just really marvelous how
[46:32] he was bringing the thought from it
[46:35] sufficeth us. It will be sufficient.
[46:37] It's enough. That's what I need. And
[46:39] whatever our situation was, just to
[46:42] repeat a little of his words, whatever
[46:44] whatever your situation is today, he
[46:47] used it for Wednesday, I'll use it for
[46:49] this morning. Whatever wherever you're
[46:51] at spiritually or materially or
[46:55] physically or any other way, BUT JUST
[46:58] SHOW US THE FATHER AND THAT'LL be
[47:00] sufficient. All we need to do IS SEE
[47:02] HIM.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; ALL YOU need to do, you don't need to
[47:05] see me. You don't need to see your
[47:06] friends, your peers. You don't need to
[47:09] see who you're have so much wonderful
[47:11] fellowship with in the church. You need
[47:12] to see him AND THAT'LL SUFFICE. THAT'LL
[47:16] BE SUFFICIENT.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO say that's all that I really
[47:19] need. And in that message, show us the
[47:22] father. Uh brother Brandham, he said,
[47:25] let's take a little trip. He's he's he's
[47:28] actually making this
[47:31] a a drama. Let's take a little trip to
[47:35] see who he was.
[47:38] And he said, "You can find out whether
[47:40] God was in his son or not. Take a little
[47:44] trip." And he goes a 100 million years
[47:47] before there was ever a star in the sky.
[47:50] There was God. And God was there then.
[47:55] And I'm I'm abbreviating some of this.
[47:57] He says, "And then the logos,"
[48:00] and don't get lost when we just say that
[48:02] the word now he's giving the process.
[48:04] And then the logos went out from God
[48:08] which was Christ. The anointing
[48:12] that went out and I haven't been able to
[48:15] escape this for the last weeks. The
[48:18] logos, this great eternal being, the
[48:23] divine one, the God that fills all
[48:26] times, the God that's so mysterious that
[48:28] you couldn't begin to understand him. I
[48:30] couldn't begin to understand him. But he
[48:32] wants to be known. He wants to reveal
[48:35] himself. He wants to have fellowship.
[48:39] Brother Brandham said Jesus when he was
[48:41] here on earth, he only asked for one
[48:43] thing, FOR OUR FELLOWSHIP. WHY? BECAUSE
[48:46] HE CAME FORTH FROM GOD. HE PROCEEDED
[48:48] FROM GOD. Had the he was the attributes
[48:51] of God. He wanted fellowship
[48:55] &gt;&gt; if we could grasp that. And so he came
[48:58] forth from God and the logos went out of
[49:00] God which was Christ the anointing that
[49:04] went out. So no wonder the Jews or the
[49:07] Hebrews had that understanding that
[49:10] something was being transferred.
[49:13] I've looked into what some other
[49:15] scholars have said about the anointing
[49:18] and about the logos and about the great
[49:22] eternal one and I can tell you that no
[49:26] one and I have I've read some things
[49:28] that make your head spin a bit but when
[49:31] a prophet comes he can say it in such a
[49:34] way so that you can you can actually
[49:37] grasp a hold of it. You've got something
[49:40] that you can sink your teeth into. you
[49:42] can get around it with your mind. And
[49:45] even though it may jar us a little bit,
[49:48] yet it it it it captivates you. It's so
[49:50] wonderful. And so when he begins to say
[49:53] the anointing that went out and now he
[49:57] said, "No, man." He said, "We're
[49:58] standing on the banister watching the
[50:01] creation come into existence and see
[50:04] whether he was his son, whether say
[50:06] whether he's his son now." But now watch
[50:10] this transferal. The logos, the word
[50:14] went out from this great being. Brother
[50:16] Bram says another place perhaps a little
[50:18] light. We see it. It starts to circle
[50:20] out and it's the logos. It's something
[50:23] coming out from God. But now what's in
[50:26] the mind of God? Because now that is why
[50:28] the Jews had this this something is
[50:31] being transferred. And what's this
[50:34] transferral? Now it comes in what we
[50:36] have in the scripture. In the beginning,
[50:38] in the beginning was the word. But this
[50:41] the Bible says tells us in the beginning
[50:43] and God said let there be and we find
[50:47] now that it begins to transfer the
[50:50] transferal comes into a creation. And I
[50:53] don't want to go in uh spend a lot of
[50:55] time on it but he begin to transfer
[50:57] life. He chose and selected this planet
[51:01] that we're on.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; This molten mass,
[51:11] this little speck of nothing as it were.
[51:16] The prophet calls it a clinker that
[51:18] perhaps flew off the sun. This little
[51:23] here we're sitting today and we're all
[51:25] part of what came out of the ashes, out
[51:29] of the remains. And God was making in
[51:33] his mind was making a structured person.
[51:37] He was laying out his 2x4s like a
[51:39] contractor making the uh calcium and the
[51:44] potassium and whatever more goes into
[51:46] make up our bodies that were sitting in
[51:48] here today. God had us in his mind
[51:52] billions of years ago. If there is such
[51:54] a thing, do you believe that?
[51:57] &gt;&gt; And now he's bringing it. And now he
[51:58] begins to transfer himself. He begins to
[52:01] transfer life. And the and the prophet
[52:04] said he he spoke because there were
[52:07] seeds down there. The seeds were buried.
[52:10] Let there be light because there had to
[52:12] be something that the light could re
[52:14] that the seeds could respond to. And so
[52:18] light comes. Light is born in a region
[52:22] that is that this earth can respond to.
[52:26] and he's chosen this earth and he's
[52:29] actually anointing the earth as it were
[52:33] because he's pouring out he's pouring
[52:35] out the horn of his creative power upon
[52:40] the earth this earth and then he says
[52:44] let the earth bring forth WHAT'S HE
[52:46] DOING HE'S TRANSFERRING SOMETHING THAT
[52:49] WENT OUT FROM HIMSELF it went out of THE
[52:52] BOSOM OF ALMIGHTY GOD WAS THE LOGOS it
[52:55] was the word and the word spoke. NOW, I
[52:59] DOUBT IF HE SPOKE ENGLISH. I DOUBT IF HE
[53:01] SPOKE HEBREW. I don't know what he said.
[53:03] I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS. BUT IT WAS AN
[53:05] UTTERANCE. LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH.
[53:08] AND THE EARTH BEGAN TO BRING FORTH.
[53:11] Something from this logos was
[53:12] transferred to the very earth. And out
[53:16] of the earth began to grow herb and
[53:19] trees and all manner OF THINGS AND
[53:22] FLOWERS of the field. And it IT IT JUST
[53:25] BLOSSOMED WITH A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LIFE
[53:28] BECAUSE IT WAS COMING OUT OF THE BOSOM
[53:30] OF GOD.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[53:33] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WASN'T SUFFICIENT. HE HAD MORE
[53:36] in his bosom. And so HE SAID, "LET THE
[53:40] WATERS BRING FORTH AND THE WATERS came
[53:42] alive." I don't care whether it took a
[53:45] million, 10 million or 100 million
[53:47] years. Had nothing to do. I don't care
[53:49] HOW IT HAPPENED, BUT IT HAPPENED. AND
[53:52] THAT'S HOW IT happened because God said,
[53:54] "Let it bring forth." And the animal
[53:57] kingdom came forth and higher and higher
[54:00] and higher came this because God is
[54:03] transferring.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE HE'S ANOINTING THE EARTH WITH
[54:08] LIFE. HE'S TRANSFERRING UPON IT, pouring
[54:11] out the horn of his life.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; And then
[54:18] he must have his own image there. and he
[54:21] makes a man.
[54:24] Let us make man in our image.
[54:27] And when he had done that, there was no
[54:30] no one to till the ground.
[54:33] Man was made an image of God. God is a
[54:36] spirit, Jesus said. So he must make a
[54:38] man to till the ground and to care for
[54:43] the earth in the garden. And he brings
[54:46] forth and forms him
[54:49] out of the earth, out of the elements.
[54:52] And there was a body. And then the
[54:55] scripture says, "And he breathed
[55:00] into man
[55:02] into his nostrils, and man became a
[55:06] living soul."
[55:08] That is different from just spoken word.
[55:16] He spoke his word and the earth brought
[55:18] forth. He spoke his word and the waters
[55:20] brought forth. He spoke his word and all
[55:23] of the life came forth. All the levels
[55:25] of life came forth, but he never
[55:27] breathed into them.
[55:30] It was this breath that separated the
[55:33] man from all other. Even though it all
[55:36] came out of God, came out of the very
[55:39] bosom of God. He's expressing himself,
[55:42] but he breathed into him and man became
[55:46] a living soul. And Jesus when they had
[55:49] heard his word, they heard the spoken
[55:52] word AND THEY HAD THE SPOKEN WORD OF THE
[55:55] PROPHETS, BUT IT REQUIRED SOMETHING
[55:58] FURTHER.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; And he told them, "As the father hath
[56:04] sent me, as a FATHER HAVE SENT ME, so
[56:07] send you." Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; As I have come out of the father, AS I
[56:18] HAVE proceeded out FROM GOD, THAT'S HOW
[56:22] I AM SENDING YOU.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; I CAME FROM THE BOSOM OF GOD. AND YOU
[56:27] ARE JUST AN EXTENSION
[56:29] OF THAT COMING FORTH. AND NOW I SEND YOU
[56:33] EXACTLY AS I HAVE BEEN SENT. I SEND YOU.
[56:38] I came OUT FROM GOD. I AM A I'VE BEEN
[56:41] TRANSFERRED FROM GOD, OUT OF GOD, OUT OF
[56:45] HIS VERY BOSOM, OUT OF HIS VERY
[56:47] ATTRIBUTES. I'VE BEEN SENT OUT. AND AS
[56:50] I'VE BEEN SENT, I SEND YOU.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; You have no more to You have no more
[56:55] right to doubt that than Jesus had to
[56:58] doubt that he came out of God.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; You have no right to doubt that.
[57:05] AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS,
[57:08] WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS, he breathed on
[57:12] them
[57:13] &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "RECEIVE YE THE HOLY GHOST."
[57:17] IT WASN'T SUFFICIENT EVEN TO SAY IT,
[57:20] JUST TO SAY IT. THEY KNEW THAT THEY MUST
[57:22] GO AND TARRY. They must go and wait. And
[57:25] there WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD
[57:27] LITERALLY TAKE PLACE. AND WITH AND there
[57:29] was a rushing
[57:31] mighty wind AND THAT FILLED THE WHOLE
[57:34] PLACE. AND THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE
[57:37] HOLY GHOST. AND AT THAT MOMENT, THAT 120
[57:41] WAS THE ONLY 120 ON THE EARTH THAT WAS
[57:44] DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER MANKIND.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; EVEN AS ADAM WAS DIFFERENT FROM
[57:53] EVERYTHING ELSE, FROM ALL OTHER, ALL
[57:55] OTHERS HAD LIFE. BUT THESE HAD A
[57:57] DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFE. THE TRANSFERRAL
[58:00] OF GOD HIMSELF, OF HIS OWN BREATH, OF
[58:04] HIS OWN LIFE, OF HIS OWN NATURE, OF HIS
[58:06] OWN CHARACTER come into the people.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; And that IS STILL IN FORCE TODAY. And
[58:14] that is what's needed amongst the
[58:17] believers OF THIS MESSAGE IS THE
[58:20] TRANSFERAL. NOT JUST TO HEAR A TAPE, NOT
[58:23] JUST TO READ A BOOK, BUT TO HAVE THE
[58:26] AUTHOR OF THE BOOK TO BREATHE INTO YOU
[58:31] &gt;&gt; the breath.
[58:36] And I want to tell you whatever you
[58:38] think of me or whatever anyone who ever
[58:40] hears this
[58:43] service hears what I have to say and
[58:47] this I believe
[58:49] that when God
[58:52] when he spoke and creation came and so
[58:54] on then he began to speak directly to a
[58:57] people
[58:59] in the mountain. God speaking to the
[59:03] people and the people came to the
[59:06] prophet. Moses was already a prophet.
[59:08] They came to Moses their prophet and
[59:11] said,
[59:13] "Don't have God speak to us.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; We can't bear this.
[59:20] LET GOD SPEAK TO YOU and you speak to
[59:24] us." And so God agreed.
[59:29] He complied.
[59:31] AND NOW THAT WAS THE FIRST INSTANCE. Now
[59:35] we have a vessel. God decreed that a
[59:39] vessel, a human vessel shall be his it
[59:43] will be his uh uh conduit is as I if I
[59:47] can say it that way. It will be his his
[59:50] his METHOD HIS PROCESS TO CONVEY his
[59:54] breath
[59:55] &gt;&gt; FROM HIMSELF TO THE PEOPLE. AND SO HE
[1:00:00] WOULD HAVE HIS PROPHETS, HIS SEERS.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes they were called seers. And
[1:00:06] again, I refer to brother Tom's message
[1:00:08] on Wednesday. Whenever God would do
[1:00:12] something to manifest himself, a
[1:00:15] remarkable way he WOULD HAVE A SEAR TO
[1:00:18] IDENTIFY THAT changing of his mask.
[1:00:22] Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; And when WE GRASP AT THE PRINCIPLE, THEN
[1:00:27] WE CAN TRANS then we can in our minds
[1:00:29] take that principle and move it up to
[1:00:32] the present time.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; GOD HE HAD TO NOW HE HAD IS PART OF HIS
[1:00:37] PRO AND HE KNEW THAT BEFORE THE
[1:00:39] FOUNDATION OF the world that this would
[1:00:41] take place AND SO NOW GOD RAISES UP
[1:00:44] PROPHETS AND THE PROPHETS BECOME HIS
[1:00:47] INSTRUMENT THROUGH WHICH HIS BREATH WILL
[1:00:50] FLOW.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S NOT THROUGH THEIR MIND. IT IS
[1:00:54] SIMPLY THROUGH THEIR MOUTH. AND MOSES
[1:00:57] SPOKE ONE LANGUAGE. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:00:59] SPOKE ANOTHER LANGUAGE. THE MESSENGER
[1:01:02] SPOKE OTHER LANGUAGES. PAUL SPOKE
[1:01:04] ANOTHER LANGUAGE. HE SPOKE MORE THAN ONE
[1:01:06] LANGUAGE. BUT IT ALL WAS THE SAME THING.
[1:01:10] GOD TRANSFERRING
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS COMING OUT OF HIM. WHAT THE
[1:01:16] HEBREWS CALL AN ANOINTING. GOD. He in he
[1:01:20] impregnated
[1:01:22] his word with his life.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD NOT SEPARATE THE LIFE OF GOD
[1:01:28] FROM THE WORD OF GOD. YOU COULD SAY THE
[1:01:30] WORD IS HIS LIFE AND THE LIFE OF HIS is
[1:01:32] his word. It's synonymous. It's one AND
[1:01:35] THE SAME. SO GOD INFUSED, HE IMPREGNATED
[1:01:40] HIS WORD WITH HIS OWN LIFE AND THEN
[1:01:43] BREATHED THAT WORD THROUGH HIS PROPHETS.
[1:01:46] IT WAS ACTUALLY THE BREATH OF GOD.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; So when YOU RECEIVE THAT, NOT JUST WHEN
[1:01:52] you read it with your eyes or hear it
[1:01:54] with your physical ears, BUT WHEN YOU
[1:01:56] RECEIVE IT IN YOUR SOUL, THEN THAT LIFE,
[1:02:00] THAT'S WHY JESUS SAID THE WORD IS THE
[1:02:02] SEED. IT HAS WITHIN IT, IT HAS ALL THE
[1:02:06] COMPOUND UH UH UH ALL THE COMPOUNDS
[1:02:10] THAT'S ESSENTIAL FOR BRINGING FORTH
[1:02:12] WHATEVER THAT WORD IN ITS SEASON SAID.
[1:02:16] AMEN.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; And that is why Jesus could take in Luke
[1:02:21] 4 and say, "The spirit of the Lord hath
[1:02:25] anointed me TO PREACH THE GOSPEL, TO
[1:02:29] HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED, TO LOOSE THE
[1:02:31] PRISONERS BECAUSE THAT WORD WAS FOR HIM,
[1:02:34] AND TO PREACH THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE
[1:02:36] LORD. THIS DAY IS THIS SCRIPTURE
[1:02:39] FULFILLED IN YOUR EARS." AND THAT
[1:02:42] PROMISED WORD WHICH WAS PROPHESIED BY
[1:02:44] MALACHI AND BY ISAIAH WAS IN HIM AND IT
[1:02:49] CAME FORTH TO LIFE IN HIM.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; HE RECEIVED IT.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; HE DID NOT RECEIVE A MESSAGE FOR A
[1:02:59] RAPTURE, taking a whole group of PEOPLE
[1:03:02] INTO A BODY CHANGE. BUT THE PROPHET, THE
[1:03:06] PROPHET uh Paul, HE GAVE THAT PROPHETIC
[1:03:10] SEED AND GOD BREATHED OUT FROM HIM IN
[1:03:14] SEED FORM THOSE PROMISES THAT WE SHALL
[1:03:18] NOT ALL SLEEP, BUT WE SHALL ALL BE
[1:03:23] CHANGED. I ASK YOU, WHO WAS THAT FOR?
[1:03:27] WHO WAS THAT INTENDED FOR?
[1:03:30] WHO WHO WHO WAS WHAT WHAT WAS THE
[1:03:32] PURPOSE OF GOD SPEAKING THAT? WHO IS IT
[1:03:34] FOR? AND THEN COMES A SEER, A PROPHET
[1:03:39] SEER IN THE END TIME AND SHOWS A SIGN OF
[1:03:43] THE RESURRECTION AND SAYS, "NOW IS THE
[1:03:46] TIME. THIS IS THE SEASON, MY FRIENDS.
[1:03:51] Whether I see it or not, YOU WANT TO
[1:03:53] BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL YOUR HEART. TO
[1:03:55] BELIEVE IT IS TO RECEIVE IT. TO BELIEVE
[1:03:57] IT IS TO BE THE RECIPIENT. TO DOUBT IT
[1:03:59] IS DEATH. TO DOUBT IT, YOU'LL STILL GO
[1:04:02] TO CHURCH. TO DOUBT IT, YOU MAY STILL
[1:04:04] SPEAK IN TONGUES. TO DOUBT IT, YOU STILL
[1:04:06] PLAY IN A ORCHESTRA. TO DOUBT IT, YOU
[1:04:08] CAN STILL SING SONGS THAT HAS NOTHING TO
[1:04:10] DO WITH IT.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL MISS IT.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WORD IS INFUSED. IT'S
[1:04:16] PREGNANTATED
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; WITH THE rapture life.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; AND IT IN ITSELF ALREADY IS ANOINTED.
[1:04:29] You know, just little thoughts along the
[1:04:32] side
[1:04:35] in the Bible,
[1:04:37] God told them, "Anoint the altar, anoint
[1:04:41] it with oil." And they did.
[1:04:44] and had and because I can say the earth
[1:04:48] to me
[1:04:50] could couldn't find where brother
[1:04:51] Brandham said it but in my studies the
[1:04:55] earth to me was like God's altar
[1:04:59] because here on the earth
[1:05:02] doesn't say he poured out his spirit on
[1:05:04] the sun or poured out his spirit on the
[1:05:06] moon or poured out his spirit on Pluto
[1:05:10] or Jupiter or Saturn or other galaxies.
[1:05:15] We have no record. But his spirit moved
[1:05:20] over the face of the earth.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Moved. And the prophet said
[1:05:25] he cooed.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; He brooded. He cooed in love and he
[1:05:30] brooded upon the face of the earth. Why?
[1:05:32] Because he loved the water. NO. BECAUSE
[1:05:34] WHAT WAS IN THE EARTH?
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE LAYING THERE.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU WERE LAYING THERE.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; And there's many that are asleep in the
[1:05:46] earth. And the same Holy Spirit is
[1:05:49] couping over this earth waiting ON THAT
[1:05:51] PROMISE. I'M GOING TO BRING THEM FORTH.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO BRING THEM
[1:05:56] FORTH.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; WE SHALL not all sleep. But those that
[1:06:01] are asleep in Christ shall BE FIRST
[1:06:04] RAISED. THEY'LL FIRST BE RAISED. DO YOU
[1:06:08] KNOW ANYBODY THAT'S GOING TO BE RAISED?
[1:06:10] ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S
[1:06:11] GOING TO BE RAISED? THEY'LL FIRST BE
[1:06:13] RAISED. HALLELUJAH. AND THEN WE WHICH
[1:06:16] ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN, HERE'S THE SEED.
[1:06:19] HERE'S THE SEED. SHALL BE CHANGED
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; IN A MOMENT, IN A TWINKLING OF AN EYE.
[1:06:26] IS THAT YOUR promise
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; that was in seed form and now we're in
[1:06:33] the manifestation part of it? AND WE'VE
[1:06:36] RECEIVED THE SIGN, RECEIVED THE PROPHET
[1:06:38] SEER
[1:06:39] who the breath of God could come
[1:06:41] through.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:06:49] that ministry is so different.
[1:06:51] And you know the altar
[1:06:54] also had to be sprinkled with blood.
[1:06:58] And this earth
[1:07:00] as God's altar
[1:07:02] was sprinkled with blood.
[1:07:04] his own blood.
[1:07:06] He says, "I'll make it new blood. I'll
[1:07:10] create blood again
[1:07:13] and it'll be sprinkled,
[1:07:17] spattered on the earth. I'll claim that
[1:07:20] little speck of dust out in its orbit."
[1:07:25] Friends, this would just be some
[1:07:30] star.
[1:07:31] And even scientists that try to
[1:07:34] understand
[1:07:36] try to understand this earth they try to
[1:07:38] understand these things try to
[1:07:40] understand our place in the universe and
[1:07:43] in the in the tens of billions billions
[1:07:47] of galaxies.
[1:07:49] If you go into it you just get lost.
[1:07:54] If you go into it as a believer you're
[1:07:56] bound to say
[1:07:59] God how great thou art.
[1:08:03] You're bound to say, "How did you ever
[1:08:06] find me?
[1:08:09] How are you aware of me that God should
[1:08:12] think of me? That God should be
[1:08:15] concerned that I'm a sinner that God
[1:08:18] should be concerned about my need. THAT
[1:08:22] GOD SHOULD BE CONCERNED. I HAVE A PAIN.
[1:08:25] I have a sickness. I HAVE A DISEASE.
[1:08:26] THAT GOD SHOULD BE SO CONCERNED. I'LL
[1:08:29] COME DOWN
[1:08:31] I'LL CONDESCEND DOWN AND I'LL MAKE A WAY
[1:08:35] WHERE YOU CAN BE FREE OF YOUR GUILT,
[1:08:37] FREE OF YOUR SIN, FREE OF YOUR DISEASE,
[1:08:40] FREE OF ALL THE GRACE THAT BROUGHT IT
[1:08:43] DOWN to man.
[1:08:47] I
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; tell you what, friends, if I shut this
[1:08:48] service down right now and you didn't
[1:08:50] praise him, I'd say you'd be nigh unto a
[1:08:54] sinner.
[1:08:56] HOW CAN A HOW CAN A REDEEMED ONE HOLD
[1:08:59] THEIR PEACE?
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE DID
[1:09:04] AND BE AT PEACE AND BE SILENT? NO. GOD
[1:09:08] NOW HAS PUT SOMETHING IN THE PEOPLE.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; GOD DESIRES WORSHIP AND WE'RE HERE TO
[1:09:13] WORSHIP HIM.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:27] the concept or the understanding of the
[1:09:29] anointing
[1:09:31] even before the beginning and that's
[1:09:33] where I've brought you from in thought
[1:09:36] I've tried to bring you along
[1:09:40] and then
[1:09:45] I want to just give you uh
[1:09:49] another thought if you could for a
[1:09:50] moment.
[1:09:52] follow with me.
[1:09:54] You see Jesus saying, I proceeded forth
[1:09:57] from God.
[1:10:02] I would like you to see him as the
[1:10:05] branch coming forth from the stalk.
[1:10:10] And the Bible says of him,
[1:10:15] Isaiah speaking, he said, "And there
[1:10:17] shall come forth a rod,"
[1:10:20] or the rod, the word in the Hebrews
[1:10:22] actually a branch. There shall come
[1:10:24] forth a branch or another meaning is a
[1:10:27] twig
[1:10:28] out of the stem
[1:10:31] which is the trunk
[1:10:34] or the stalk of Jesse
[1:10:37] and a branch shall grow out of his
[1:10:39] roots.
[1:10:41] Jesus was like
[1:10:44] in his coming here is like a a branch of
[1:10:47] Jesse a twig coming forth. And then
[1:10:52] Jesus would say,
[1:10:54] "I'm the true vine.
[1:10:57] My father's the husbandman."
[1:11:01] And if there's a true vine,
[1:11:04] something that is is very unique in
[1:11:06] Brother Brandham's ministry. And I I'm
[1:11:08] just giving this to you. I'm sewing this
[1:11:10] thought because you've run into it many,
[1:11:12] many times. And it has a great deal of
[1:11:15] meaning to me because I was when I was
[1:11:18] with brother Brandham, I was really
[1:11:20] quite
[1:11:22] I was distressed, I guess would be the
[1:11:24] right word at all. The anointed things
[1:11:28] that I saw took place and I made
[1:11:30] reference to them before. I heard
[1:11:32] prophecies that were not accurate did
[1:11:35] not happen and they were anointed and I
[1:11:38] couldn't understand it and great
[1:11:40] manifestations
[1:11:42] saw miracles and other things.
[1:11:46] I saw three deaf and dumb persons in a
[1:11:49] man's meeting and a small handful of
[1:11:52] people compared to brother Brandham's
[1:11:54] meetings or or Roberts's meetings or
[1:11:56] Tommy Hicks or Tommy Osburn or any of
[1:11:59] these other men. We always think of the
[1:12:01] big tents and the biggy big auditoriums,
[1:12:03] but this was out in the field out in the
[1:12:05] open.
[1:12:07] And over a period, I think of two or
[1:12:09] three days in two small towns, both in
[1:12:12] British Columbia. I saw three deaf and
[1:12:15] dumb persons
[1:12:17] prayed for by a man I still remember his
[1:12:19] name. I won't name it just now. And he
[1:12:21] was from California, a preacher. Only
[1:12:23] saw him then, never saw him again. He He
[1:12:27] took control of that demon and cast that
[1:12:31] deaf and dumb spirit out and had that
[1:12:34] person hear and speak right there at the
[1:12:36] platform.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; And I was about 15. I never forgot that.
[1:12:44] Anointed?
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And was that from God?
[1:12:48] Absolutely. It's from God.
[1:12:51] And I wouldn't ident
[1:12:56] fine man. But with all even today you
[1:13:00] think anointed singing. We hear anointed
[1:13:02] singing and anointed preaching and
[1:13:05] anointed because Jesus said in the last
[1:13:08] days in the last days it would be so
[1:13:11] close
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; so as to deceive the very elect if
[1:13:15] possible. it was. So, it's going to be
[1:13:18] so close and you won't find it anywhere
[1:13:20] else. You just don't find it. But now,
[1:13:23] Brother Brandham brings false anointed
[1:13:25] ones and that has such a significant
[1:13:27] place in my life and my experience
[1:13:29] because I sat there on that log
[1:13:33] and had him when I raised the question
[1:13:36] and he said, "Have you heard my tape or
[1:13:39] my message on false anointed ones?" And
[1:13:42] I felt bad and I felt somewhat
[1:13:44] embarrassed that I had not heard it. I'd
[1:13:47] heard a few tapes but not many. And uh
[1:13:53] so I said no I haven't heard it. So then
[1:13:55] he went into the scriptures
[1:13:58] and in the scriptures one of the
[1:14:00] scriptures was in the last days sayith
[1:14:02] God I will pour out what is it pouring
[1:14:08] out. It's like an anointing. I will pour
[1:14:11] out my spirit upon all. And brother
[1:14:14] Brandon when he came to that he said
[1:14:15] I'll pour out my spirit upon and I said
[1:14:19] all. I answered because he waiting for
[1:14:21] the answer. I said all and he said a ll
[1:14:24] flesh but not all flesh is saved.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; I said that is correct. He said the
[1:14:31] wheat and the tears. You remember the
[1:14:34] parable? Yes. I said, he said, "You tell
[1:14:38] me what the wheat what caused the wheat
[1:14:41] to grow, what caused the wheat to
[1:14:43] rejoice, what caused what gave the wheat
[1:14:46] strength, and I'll tell you what the
[1:14:48] tears rejoiced in cuz they both had the
[1:14:51] same source." And he went through two
[1:14:53] more scriptures and then I tell you
[1:14:56] what, friends, it was like an explosion
[1:14:58] took place. And I also said to myself, I
[1:15:02] said to myself, I felt very very uh
[1:15:05] humbled because I said to myself, you
[1:15:08] have read those scriptures hundreds of
[1:15:10] times. Why haven't we why haven't I seen
[1:15:13] that before? And then I realized that
[1:15:16] the word coming in its season out of the
[1:15:19] right mouth had a different had a whole
[1:15:22] different power to it. And it's the same
[1:15:25] scripture. It just took on a whole new
[1:15:28] scope, a whole new meaning.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; And then when you get into false
[1:15:32] anointed ones, you'll find in several
[1:15:34] places you'll say, "Now, he was to this
[1:15:37] brother's place, and there's a a citrus
[1:15:41] tree, an orange tree, and in there is
[1:15:44] growing lemons and grapefruit, and
[1:15:48] tangelos, and several other fruits, but
[1:15:51] they're all citrus. and the branches are
[1:15:54] all growing out of this orange tree. And
[1:15:57] brother Brandham says, "Well, how is
[1:16:00] that? How can they all be manifesting
[1:16:03] these other things?"
[1:16:06] And he says, "Well, because that's what
[1:16:08] they are. That's the branch they are."
[1:16:10] Oh. He says, "So now next year,
[1:16:14] next year these will all grow oranges."
[1:16:17] He said, "Oh no,
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; no. The lemon branch will bring a
[1:16:21] lemon." And the tangelo will bring a
[1:16:24] tangelo and the grapefruit will bring IT
[1:16:26] EVEN NEXT YEAR. YES, it'll keep on
[1:16:28] bringing that. But it's drawing life
[1:16:31] from the vine. It's drawing life from
[1:16:34] the tree. And now this whole series of
[1:16:37] messages has actually erupted from this
[1:16:40] next phrase which he makes. And whether
[1:16:42] it is that service, whether it is
[1:16:44] anointed ones, false anointed ones, but
[1:16:47] he's he makes this statement. They have
[1:16:49] the life like that. But then his
[1:16:52] statement is, "But they're bearing false
[1:16:55] witness to the tree."
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; And that's why I said
[1:17:04] the anointing that came out from God,
[1:17:06] the purpose of that is to bring a true
[1:17:10] evidence
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; to the tree.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:15] SO WHEN JESUS CAME,
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; HE COULD SAY I'M THE TRUE VINE
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS BRINGING FORTH A TRUE
[1:17:22] EVIDENCE,
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTING. HE SAID, "THE SPIRIT OF
[1:17:26] THE LORD IS UPON ME BECAUSE HE HATH
[1:17:28] ANOINTED ME." HE WAS ANOINTED NOT ONLY
[1:17:31] TO BRING EVIDENCE, BUT TO BRING A TRUE
[1:17:34] EVIDENCE OF THE ORIGINAL STOCK. AND MY
[1:17:37] BROTHER, my sister, YOU'RE ORDAINED. YOU
[1:17:40] ARE ORDAINED BY GOD. GOD'S PURPOSE TO
[1:17:43] BRING THIS MESSAGE IS TO LET IT COME
[1:17:45] INTO YOUR HEART AND TO ANOINT IT BY THE
[1:17:48] HOLY SPIRIT SO THAT YOU WILL BRING A
[1:17:50] TRUE EVIDENCE.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; A TRUE EVIDENCE. YOU'RE ANOINTED TO
[1:17:55] BRING FORTH A TRUE EVIDENCE of the
[1:17:58] original vine.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; That's why he SENT THIS WORD. WE'RE NOT
[1:18:05] JUST HERE TO BE ANOTHER CHURCH. WE'RE
[1:18:07] NOT JUST HERE TO BE IDENTIFIED as as a a
[1:18:10] some kind of a group of people. We have
[1:18:12] been ordained by God. WE'RE NOT HERE TO
[1:18:16] BRING FORTH A Baptist branch, a
[1:18:19] Pentecostal branch, a Catholic branch.
[1:18:22] THEY MAY ALL GET THEIR LIFE FROM THAT
[1:18:24] VINE. BUT there are those that come from
[1:18:28] an original twig, an original branch.
[1:18:31] AND THAT ORIGINAL BRANCH WILL ALWAYS
[1:18:33] BRING FORTH ORANGES. IT'LL BRING FORTH
[1:18:36] THE ORIGINAL LIFE.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; And that branch, that life has been
[1:18:44] ordained for the rapture because I came
[1:18:47] from God AND I RETURN BACK TO GOD.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; You've got to believe that.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:05] There shall come forth a branch.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could go on and say
[1:19:15] Jesus coming forth who was the word
[1:19:18] himself
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; proceeded OUT FROM GOD. HE WAS THE
[1:19:22] BREATH of God.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT A PROPHET OF GOD. HE was the
[1:19:30] God prophet. Prophets of God were
[1:19:34] instruments through which the breath of
[1:19:35] God COULD COME.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS CHRIST WAS THE WORD. HE WAS
[1:19:41] THE VERY BREATH OF GOD.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; IN HIM WAS LIFE.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT LIFE WAS THE LIGHT
[1:19:47] OF MAN.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; BUT OTHER PROPHETS CAME AND THEY WERE
[1:19:53] INSTRUMENTS THROUGH WHICH THE BREATH of
[1:19:55] God came was breathed through. AND THEN
[1:20:01] THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDON MAKES A
[1:20:02] DISTINCTION. HE says now he said when
[1:20:06] you hear that thus sayaith the Lord
[1:20:10] it's not me speaking.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; That's a different breath.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You follow me?
[1:20:22] You know, just to make it clear.
[1:20:29] Jesus did not say some things, for
[1:20:32] example, that brother Brandham said.
[1:20:35] Brother Brandham could say, "Oh, I've
[1:20:37] just made so many mistakes."
[1:20:40] He's a man. I've made so many. You never
[1:20:43] hear Jesus saying, "I've made so many
[1:20:44] mistakes." Brother Bram said, "I was a
[1:20:47] sinner.
[1:20:48] I repented of my sins. You never hear
[1:20:51] Jesus say that.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My blood is drink indeed
[1:20:57] and my flesh is meat indeed." Brother
[1:20:59] Brandon couldn't say that.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; One was the logos himself and the other
[1:21:06] was a vessel of the logos.
[1:21:09] It's important to understand that
[1:21:10] because people go on both sides. Then
[1:21:12] some people use those maybe statements
[1:21:15] similar to mine and say, "Well, there
[1:21:17] was a difference in you only you only
[1:21:19] pay attention to what brother Brandham
[1:21:21] said when he said, "Thus sayith the
[1:21:22] Lord." I don't accept that.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; I don't accept that either.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; I probably should, you know, people have
[1:21:33] used that. Ministers have used that
[1:21:35] sadly because they want to go toodling
[1:21:37] off on their own direction. They have
[1:21:39] their own revelation and they end off
[1:21:41] way off in some wilderness. And the sad
[1:21:43] part is I wouldn't mind if they want to
[1:21:45] go riding off there but they take a
[1:21:47] whole group of people with them and it's
[1:21:49] really sad saying well you know try to
[1:21:51] indicate infer that the message is
[1:21:53] unreliable. The message isn't unreliable
[1:21:55] friends. It's an absolute to us. It is
[1:21:57] the revelation of God's word to us
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; but it'll always harmonize with the
[1:22:02] word.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Always harmonize with the word.
[1:22:06] Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; And so my desire
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; for the congregation here, my desire for
[1:22:12] this congregation
[1:22:13] is that we will bear and I've been I've
[1:22:16] been praying for you. I hope you've been
[1:22:18] praying for me. Praying for you as a
[1:22:20] congregation, appreciating you as a
[1:22:23] congregation.
[1:22:26] And the message I've just been listening
[1:22:27] to, testimony of a true witness. Brother
[1:22:31] Brandham has just lost his mother and I
[1:22:33] was with him just before that. and he
[1:22:35] had the vision of the hunt and
[1:22:37] everything. And then he explained to the
[1:22:39] people in another service right after
[1:22:41] his mother departed that God gave him
[1:22:44] that hunt to comfort him
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; in what he was going to be facing. But
[1:22:49] when he comes in November of 61, I
[1:22:51] believe it is, he comes and he's just
[1:22:53] lost his mother. And that is he spends
[1:22:56] so much of the service on how how what
[1:22:59] he thought of his mother and what his
[1:23:01] mother meant to him and how she was just
[1:23:03] such a he goes back into her
[1:23:06] conversations that he had with her and
[1:23:09] then he began to thank the people you
[1:23:11] know and he I you can just see he
[1:23:13] becomes so melancholy and he becomes so
[1:23:16] expressive to the people. was like he's
[1:23:18] talking to them one on- one and tells
[1:23:21] them how much he loved them and and
[1:23:23] thank you for coming and sitting with
[1:23:25] mother and thank you for being there
[1:23:28] with me and being there for our time of
[1:23:30] grief and he goes on and on and on. and
[1:23:33] it takes a long time in the service, but
[1:23:36] he's preaching on a testimony of a true
[1:23:38] witness.
[1:23:40] And I'd like to say to you, I just pray
[1:23:44] my prayer to God for this congregation
[1:23:47] is we don't have another church to be
[1:23:50] our example. We don't have any other
[1:23:53] place to be our example. Our example
[1:23:56] must be a word messagebased example and
[1:24:00] live by that. and I say, "Oh, God, I
[1:24:04] wouldn't want to have labored all this
[1:24:06] 34, 35 years." And then and then end up
[1:24:10] with a say a group of people or a
[1:24:13] church, not worried about you so much as
[1:24:16] worried about, you know, the influence
[1:24:17] that the world has and the influence of
[1:24:20] our jobs and the influence just of of
[1:24:23] the whole civilization that we're we're
[1:24:25] we're forced to live in. The influence
[1:24:28] of your schools, young people, the
[1:24:30] influence of your friends, the influence
[1:24:33] of the fashion industry, the influence
[1:24:35] of the sports, the influence that is so
[1:24:38] infiltrates every part of our life. You
[1:24:42] can't even hardly move or turn around
[1:24:44] before you can feel that impact of that
[1:24:46] influence. Your neighbors and your work,
[1:24:49] people that you work with and all over.
[1:24:51] I pray that God will by his divine grace
[1:24:56] allow you, my precious brothers and
[1:24:58] sisters, my precious young people, that
[1:25:01] we will when all is said and done and
[1:25:05] you surely will stand also before him
[1:25:10] that you will hear his voice, well done.
[1:25:14] You have borne, you did bear a true
[1:25:17] evidence,
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; of the tree of life.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; You bore a true evidence. You were not a
[1:25:25] false witness to this tree. You were a
[1:25:28] true witness to this tree.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] The Bible says, "Then said Jesus to them
[1:25:56] again,
[1:25:58] peace be unto you
[1:26:01] as I would like to say exactly as prec
[1:26:05] precisely as the Father
[1:26:08] hath sent me. I've proceeded out from
[1:26:12] God. I've come out of the bosom of God.
[1:26:17] As he came out, so have you come out.
[1:26:22] I want to take you back not just in some
[1:26:25] mental picture but in reality
[1:26:29] long before your greatgrandfathers and
[1:26:33] mothers and your lineage way way back to
[1:26:37] the many many countries that are
[1:26:38] represented here. Long before that
[1:26:42] listen to me you young people especially
[1:26:44] sitting here with your mother and dad.
[1:26:46] God bless them. how we thank God for
[1:26:50] godly parents. But long before that, if
[1:26:53] you could only see, if you could only
[1:26:57] recognize it,
[1:26:59] you're believing the words of your Lord
[1:27:01] Jesus as I
[1:27:05] came from God,
[1:27:08] as I've been sent, even sent with a
[1:27:11] purpose.
[1:27:14] Somebody I was just talking to
[1:27:21] in this congregation.
[1:27:24] I don't see them, but they're probably
[1:27:26] sitting here listening to me.
[1:27:28] I don't have
[1:27:30] permission to say this, but I'm going to
[1:27:32] say it. Been on my heart very, very
[1:27:34] much.
[1:27:37] I've been aware for some months
[1:27:40] God dealing with a man in this
[1:27:43] congregation
[1:27:44] very, very deeply.
[1:27:47] when he's out on a relaxation,
[1:27:50] he's carrying his Bible
[1:27:53] and I met him on occasion when he was on
[1:27:55] a relaxation on vacation. He was
[1:27:58] carrying his Bible, had his Bible
[1:28:01] in the vehicle
[1:28:03] and he starts to tell me about how God
[1:28:05] is speaking to him out of his out of the
[1:28:07] scriptures and he's weeping. He can't
[1:28:09] hold himself together and he's weeping.
[1:28:12] And I and I see now months have gone by
[1:28:15] and I've just seen a change
[1:28:17] transformation
[1:28:19] in this man.
[1:28:27] I had a conversation with him this last
[1:28:29] week,
[1:28:33] maybe two weeks ago,
[1:28:36] and he was driven to prayer.
[1:28:40] He said, "My house is busy.
[1:28:44] Children in the house,
[1:28:46] but he said, I found a place
[1:28:49] under the stairs
[1:28:52] and I've made a room
[1:28:54] where I can be alone
[1:28:57] with God."
[1:29:00] On another occasion, this isn't flash in
[1:29:03] the pan. This is not come up to the
[1:29:04] front and be prayed for and walk away
[1:29:06] and forget all about it. Another
[1:29:10] occasion just
[1:29:12] I'm being waked up early in the morning
[1:29:15] and I felt even sometimes in the night I
[1:29:18] just need to get out and pray and I
[1:29:21] start praying. He said I think I'll only
[1:29:22] pray for maybe a short time before I
[1:29:25] know it it's daylight
[1:29:28] and he has to work and he has to work
[1:29:30] hard.
[1:29:31] It's going week in week out week in week
[1:29:35] out.
[1:29:39] not long ago
[1:29:41] in the last few weeks.
[1:29:44] He's not preaching to his wife. He's not
[1:29:47] trying to bring anything down, bring her
[1:29:49] into subjection.
[1:29:51] He just concerned
[1:29:54] told me yesterday, "All I want to talk
[1:29:56] about, I just want to I want to be with
[1:29:58] you." He said, "I just want to talk
[1:30:00] about the Lord. I just want everything
[1:30:02] you can tell me about God."
[1:30:06] and his wife is in the house and has
[1:30:08] some kind of experience and God comes
[1:30:11] upon her and speaks to her and says to
[1:30:14] her Jesus Christ is in your husband.
[1:30:23] I said what is happening to you? There's
[1:30:26] a purpose in that. Now you must
[1:30:30] scan
[1:30:32] as it were to know the mind of God. what
[1:30:36] are you doing this for and what is the
[1:30:37] purpose? I said, there's someone else
[1:30:39] perhaps in the congregation you're to
[1:30:42] have an effect on. And I said, what I'm
[1:30:44] praying, I'm praying, oh God, let that
[1:30:48] be the experience not of one,
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; but of others.
[1:30:53] I feel like God is doing something. I've
[1:30:56] had you speak. I've had you email. I've
[1:30:59] had phone calls. And I myself know the
[1:31:02] word is different. I know that God is
[1:31:04] doing something different. I'm hearing
[1:31:06] the other brothers minister and God is
[1:31:09] dealing with our congregation. If I was
[1:31:12] to go off the scene today, I'd want you
[1:31:14] to remember God is dealing with this
[1:31:16] congregation in a different way.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; You feel it, don't you? You sense it.
[1:31:26] It's something deep within.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; You know what I believe it is?
[1:31:31] I believe it's the rapture word.
[1:31:34] I believe it's the anointed word for
[1:31:36] rapture.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; I believe that what God is doing is
[1:31:40] getting a people ready to leave.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; It's not just a song. It's not just a
[1:31:45] song getting ready to leave.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S TAKING PLACE
[1:31:50] THAT HAS TO DO SO.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; OUR EXAMPLES AREN'T OUT IN THE WORLD.
[1:31:54] IT'S NOT IN THE STREET. IT'S NOT IN THE
[1:31:56] MALL. IT'S NOT WHERE WE WORK. IT'S NOT
[1:31:58] IN THE SCHOOL. IT'S NOT IN THE COLLEGE.
[1:32:00] OUR EXAMPLE IS IN THE WORD AND THE WORD
[1:32:04] HAS CALLED US TO SUCH A A DEPTH IN HIM.
[1:32:07] AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT WORD WHICH CAME
[1:32:10] WAS BREATHED OUT OF GOD, CREATED THE
[1:32:13] CREATION OF THIS EARTH WHEN OUR BODIES
[1:32:16] WERE STILL IN THE SOIL AND SENT HIS WORD
[1:32:18] DOWN THROUGH HIS VESSELS THROUGH HIS
[1:32:21] PROPHETS, THE BREATH OF GOD TO THE
[1:32:23] PEOPLE IN SEED FORM. AMEN.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; THEN IT CAME TO ITS MANIFESTED FORM AND
[1:32:30] GOD SENT A MESSENGER IN THE END TIME
[1:32:34] PROPHET MESSENGER THROUGH WHOM HE COULD
[1:32:37] TRANSMIT THE VERY BREATH OF GOD.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS COULD SAY AS I HAVE BEEN SENT
[1:32:47] AS I HAVE BEEN SENT OF THE FATHER SO
[1:32:50] SEND I YOU.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DOES THIS CONGREGATION
[1:32:56] UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN MY SPIRIT AND SOUL
[1:32:59] TODAY?
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN SENT BY GOD. YOU DON'T
[1:33:02] LOOK BACK AT JUST WHERE YOU CAME FROM OR
[1:33:04] YOUR HERITAGE HERE ON EARTH. YOU'VE
[1:33:06] ISSUED OUT
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; FROM THE BOSOM OF GOD. AND GOD knew you
[1:33:11] were going to BE HERE. KNEW YOU WERE
[1:33:13] GOING TO SIT HERE IN THIS MEETING. KNEW
[1:33:15] YOU WERE GOING TO HEAR THIS THING. YOU
[1:33:17] CAME FROM GOD TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF GOD
[1:33:20] ON EARTH AND TO BEAR A TRUE WITNESS.
[1:33:24] OF THE VINE.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; It's an incredible time that we're
[1:33:44] living in, friends.
[1:33:46] And I pray that the spirit of God just
[1:33:49] keeps urging us on further that tomorrow
[1:33:53] will not be as yesterday and next week
[1:33:55] won't be like this week.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; And that you'll be used of God to have
[1:34:01] such an effect and such an influence.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; How far can we go? Who knows? There is
[1:34:08] no limits.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; We're birthed by God.
[1:34:14] Some here no doubt do not have that
[1:34:19] baptism. I'm not speaking about the gift
[1:34:22] now. I'm talking ABOUT THE PERSON
[1:34:23] HIMSELF
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; COMING INTO the individual.
[1:34:27] And it's not something we you know it's
[1:34:30] not something that we determine within
[1:34:32] ourselves. But there's one thing that we
[1:34:34] can do and that is you can create an
[1:34:37] atmosphere. You can allow God to give a
[1:34:40] hunger IN YOUR HEART DOWN INTO YOUR
[1:34:43] SOUL, A CRAVING. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT,
[1:34:47] YOU CAN. THAT'S ONE THING YOU CAN DO.
[1:34:49] YOU HAVE A VOICE. YOU HAVE SOMETHING
[1:34:51] THAT CAN EXPRESS YOUR HEART.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE A REAL DESIRE FOR GOD?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; THEN IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD TELL HIM SO.
[1:34:58] I SAY, "I HAVE SUCH A THIRST FOR YOU,
[1:35:01] SUCH A HUNGER FOR YOU. I WILL PUT MY
[1:35:03] MIND IN MY THOUGHTS. I WILL FOCUS UPON
[1:35:06] YOU. I'LL KEEP THINKING ABOUT YOU. I'LL
[1:35:09] KEEP THINKING ABOUT THE PROMISE OF THIS
[1:35:11] TIME. I WON'T LET IT GET FAR FROM ME.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close early.
[1:35:26] I want to close in this atmosphere.
[1:35:36] As I look across the congregation
[1:35:39] and now when I make my next statement,
[1:35:42] make the next few comments,
[1:35:44] I do not want you to think of, you know,
[1:35:47] perhaps the little difficulties that you
[1:35:49] have. We all have difficulties. We all
[1:35:52] have those.
[1:35:54] We have financial difficulties. We have,
[1:35:56] you know, just life life is a can be
[1:36:00] troublesome. We all have that.
[1:36:03] But I began to ask myself this last
[1:36:05] week, what is the anointing for?
[1:36:09] What is this? I can see I can see it all
[1:36:12] happen. I hope I've been I've hope I've
[1:36:14] been able to dramatize it a we bit. Do
[1:36:16] you believe it?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; You believe it come out of the bosom of
[1:36:20] God.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Here come you know, Brother Bram's
[1:36:22] trying to describe it to here comes this
[1:36:24] little light. It's the logos out of this
[1:36:27] great being that is so completely under
[1:36:30] indescribable it cannot be understood.
[1:36:32] Here comes this little light
[1:36:35] and there comes transferring out of the
[1:36:37] bosom of God.
[1:36:40] Let there be light.
[1:36:42] Brother said if there was a mist that
[1:36:44] came it wasn't the word of God. Let the
[1:36:46] earth bring forth. Let the waters bring
[1:36:49] forth
[1:36:51] all the living kind and animal kingdom.
[1:36:55] Let us make man in our image. Now he
[1:36:59] begin he's transferring himself. Now
[1:37:02] he's got one that looks like him. Just
[1:37:05] like him, my son. You be the god of the
[1:37:08] earth. Then the fall and the sin and the
[1:37:12] death and the earth that he made has
[1:37:15] been bathed in blood.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:19] cruel
[1:37:21] blood. But the scripture says the
[1:37:24] righteous blood of Abel.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus speaks better things
[1:37:29] than that. And then God now out of his
[1:37:32] bosom, he's got to bring the redemptive
[1:37:35] plan. He's going to redeem this back. I
[1:37:38] cannot lose it. I cannot be God and lose
[1:37:41] this. And he's going to bring the
[1:37:43] redemptive plan. And that that very low
[1:37:46] goss that went out from him sets in
[1:37:49] motion the redemption. And now he begins
[1:37:52] to act it out and play it out. And he
[1:37:54] brings his masterpiece Christ. Christ
[1:37:57] Christ himself was the lost just here
[1:37:59] for a little brief moment of time and he
[1:38:02] leaves and his spirit comes into 120 and
[1:38:06] they're birthed. They're different kind
[1:38:08] of people. They're God people.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; There never been people like this on the
[1:38:13] earth. They're even different from the
[1:38:15] prophets. The prophet had the word going
[1:38:18] through them, but now these were born.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; BORN BORN BY GOD.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE BIRTHED BY GOD.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; And Jesus because God himself breathed
[1:38:33] when the creation was finished. GOD
[1:38:36] BREATHED INTO ADAM AND HE BECAME a
[1:38:39] living soul. And when the new creation
[1:38:41] WAS FINISHED,
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; JESUS BREATHED ON THE DISCIPLES, RECEIVE
[1:38:47] YE THE HOLY GHOST,
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; SHOWING THAT HE WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE
[1:38:52] NEW CREATION, BUT IN HIM IT WAS
[1:38:55] COMPLETED. IT WAS DONE. AND HE BREATHED
[1:38:57] on them. Receive ye the Holy Ghost. And
[1:39:01] now these 120. And now God begins to
[1:39:05] live in a people bringing and claiming
[1:39:08] back all that was his from the very
[1:39:12] beginning. And so
[1:39:14] that breath that was breathed into us.
[1:39:19] I've received that breath.
[1:39:22] You have received that breath. If you
[1:39:25] haven't here, if you're not if you have
[1:39:27] not received that breath,
[1:39:29] set yourself aside.
[1:39:32] say, "I I I need to receive that very
[1:39:35] breath of God.
[1:39:40] A newborn creature in Christ Jesus."
[1:39:46] That's what it's about. And friends,
[1:39:48] I'll tell you, I can go back in my life
[1:39:52] and this person I was speaking to,
[1:39:55] you're listening real close. I want to
[1:39:57] really bear it down. I said to this
[1:40:00] individual,
[1:40:02] the one thing that happened with you
[1:40:06] is it's over.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; There's no more struggle.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; No more struggle.
[1:40:14] I'm not going to say this because we're
[1:40:15] strong people. I and my wife, we lack.
[1:40:17] We have many, many lacks. I could go on
[1:40:20] a confession time right now and confess,
[1:40:22] you know, that we have a lot of
[1:40:24] weaknesses.
[1:40:27] And yet,
[1:40:33] you know, because I don't know whether
[1:40:34] it's because of the ministry what it is,
[1:40:37] but my wife and I have never never been
[1:40:40] to a minister
[1:40:42] for counseling.
[1:40:45] We've never been to anyone for
[1:40:47] counseling.
[1:40:48] God has been our counsel. I'll tell you
[1:40:50] part of that is when you settled it
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; and you were born
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God, you got the very
[1:40:58] source within you and then it's all
[1:41:01] over. And that's what you need. That's
[1:41:02] what a person needs.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, I'm not opposed
[1:41:07] to I love to sit down and counsel with
[1:41:09] people to give you any kind of wisdom
[1:41:10] that I can. But I can tell you friends
[1:41:13] that we have a source.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a source. Do you believe
[1:41:17] it? We have A SOURCE. THE ALMIGHTY GOD
[1:41:20] IS OUR SOURCE.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; And when you have that kind of a
[1:41:25] experience in Christ by the Holy Spirit,
[1:41:28] it's all over.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; It's all over. You mean we won't have a
[1:41:32] tough time? We'll have hard times, BUT
[1:41:35] YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT THROUGH IT.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT THROUGH IT.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT?
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL INDEED GO STRAIGHT THROUGH IT.
[1:41:43] YOU WON'T BE UP TODAY, DOWN TOMORROW,
[1:41:45] SAVED TODAY, LOST TOMORROW. THERE'S NO
[1:41:47] SUCH A THING WITHOUT OUR GOD. WE'VE BEEN
[1:41:50] BORN BY GOD. AND WE KNOW I CAME FROM THE
[1:41:53] BOSOM OF THE FATHER.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; AND WHETHER YOU'RE CALLED HOME TODAY OR
[1:41:59] TOMORROW, THIS WEEK, NEXT WEEK, SOME
[1:42:01] PEOPLE JUST WANTING TO GET OUT OF THE
[1:42:03] WORLD. I WANT TO BE HERE AS LONG AS HE
[1:42:05] WANTS ME HERE. I WANT TO BE A TESTIMONY.
[1:42:07] I WANT TO BE A POWERFUL TESTIMONY. I
[1:42:10] DON'T CARE IF THIS WHOLE PACIFIC
[1:42:11] NORTHWEST THINKS WE'RE A BUNCH OF
[1:42:13] FANATICS UP HERE. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT
[1:42:15] I'M NOT GOING TO BE A FANATIC FOR THE
[1:42:17] SAKE OF BEING A FANATIC, BUT WE WANT TO
[1:42:19] BE WHAT HE WANTS US TO BE. I WANT TO
[1:42:21] BEAR A TRUE WITNESS TO THE VINE.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And this is what it says. I'm closing in
[1:42:34] just a couple minutes.
[1:42:37] And it shall come to pass in that day,
[1:42:39] Isaiah said,
[1:42:41] that his burden shall be taken away from
[1:42:43] off thy shoulder,
[1:42:46] and his yoke from off thy neck, and the
[1:42:49] yoke shall be destroyed
[1:42:52] because of the anointing.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; One thing the anointing will do,
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; you may have some yoke. You may have
[1:43:02] something that has pressed you down. You
[1:43:05] may have something that Satan has used
[1:43:07] against you. I will announce to you
[1:43:10] today unequivocally and without any
[1:43:12] apology. The word that has come has the
[1:43:16] POWER TO BREAK THAT YOKE.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE ANOINTING. IT IS THE BREATH OF
[1:43:22] GOD. IT'S THE VERY BREATH OF GOD. AND WE
[1:43:25] HAVE MAYBE PERSONAL THINGS IN OUR LIVES
[1:43:27] AND SAY, "OH GOD, OH GOD, WHERE'S THE
[1:43:29] DELIVERANCE FOR IT?" THE DELIVERANCE IS
[1:43:31] RIGHT HERE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOME
[1:43:33] SPECIAL, YOU KNOW, EMOTIONAL THING THAT
[1:43:35] YOU HAVE. YOU'VE JUST GOT TO BELIEVE IT.
[1:43:37] TO DISBELIEVE IT IS TO CARRY YOUR YOKE
[1:43:40] ON. YOU'LL CONTINUE ON WITH THE YOKE ON
[1:43:43] YOU. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE IT, THE YOKE,
[1:43:45] THE ANOINTING WILL BREAK THE YOKE.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Does somebody need it?
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; I'm here to do business with God.
[1:43:57] You want that yoke broken, you can stand
[1:44:00] to your feet and God will break that
[1:44:02] yoke at this moment. Don't be ashamed
[1:44:05] and don't be don't be embarrassed.
[1:44:08] That's what it came for, TO BREAK THAT
[1:44:10] YOKE. YOU BELIEVE THE WORD. YOU BELIEVE
[1:44:13] THE WORD AND THE ANOINTING WILL BREAK
[1:44:15] THE YOKE. YOU'VE RECEIVED AN ANOINTED
[1:44:18] WORD.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:44:24] you pray.
[1:44:26] You pray.
[1:44:28] YOU CALL ON THEM. FORGET WHO'S BESIDE
[1:44:30] YOU. WHETHER IT'S YOUR WIFE OR HUSBAND
[1:44:32] OR WHO IT IS, YOU PRAY.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; BREAK THAT YOKE. IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:44:37] CHRIST, I HAVE RECEIVED THE WORD. I HAVE
[1:44:41] RECEIVED THE PROMISED WORD. I HAVE
[1:44:44] RECEIVED THE BREATH OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:44:52] Hallelujah.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Receive it now.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Receive it now.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Let that yoke be broken.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; I can TELL YOU FRIENDS, SATAN IS
[1:45:03] FIGHTING HIS HARDEST RIGHT NOW. You deny
[1:45:06] him. DON'T YOU LET HIM LIE to you. Don't
[1:45:09] you let him SAY IT'S GOING TO BE THE
[1:45:11] SAME. YOU SAY IT'S GOING TO BE
[1:45:13] DIFFERENT. IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.
[1:45:15] THAT YOKE IS BROKEN. THE ANOINTING WHICH
[1:45:17] I RECEIVED BREAKS THAT YOKE. THANK YOU
[1:45:21] for your
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Going to pray with you.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Father, I know.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; You will not deny this people.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; You will not deny your word.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; You will deny Satan any opportunity for
[1:45:44] victory here this morning.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; You'll deny the powers of darkness.
[1:45:50] Oh, how he wants to fight. Oh, how he
[1:45:54] wants to resist. Oh, he wants to
[1:45:56] procrastinate.
[1:45:58] AND OUR LORD JESUS, YOU IDENTIFIED HIM.
[1:46:01] YOU SAID HE'S A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING.
[1:46:05] SATAN, you are a liar. And we are not
[1:46:08] influenced by your lies. We're not
[1:46:11] influenced BY YOUR PRESENCE. WE'RE NOT
[1:46:13] INFLUENCED BY YOUR RESISTANCE. IN THE
[1:46:16] NAME OF JESUS, WE DECLARE YOUR HEAD has
[1:46:20] been crushed. YOUR REASONING we do not
[1:46:23] accept. YOUR LIES OUR EARS ARE CLOSED
[1:46:27] TO. WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE WORD OF the
[1:46:30] Lord.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; And by that word, we have received what
[1:46:36] we have come for. Lord, we believe that
[1:46:39] we have proceeded FROM GOD. WE BELIEVE
[1:46:42] as the father sent you and you said so
[1:46:46] send I you. We've been sent into this
[1:46:51] earth AT THIS SEASON. WE WERE SENT TO
[1:46:55] HEAR WHAT WE have heard. We've been SENT
[1:46:58] TO BE BORN IN THE HOMES we were born in.
[1:47:02] We've been sent to be gathered together
[1:47:04] in this company of people. And Lord, let
[1:47:07] the individuals that are in this
[1:47:09] congregation this morning know,
[1:47:11] REGISTERED IN THEIR HEARTS. THEY'VE BEEN
[1:47:13] SENT TO HEAR THIS MESSAGE THIS MORNING.
[1:47:18] LET THEM KNOW THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS
[1:47:20] BEEN SENT TO FILL THEM. LET THEM KNOW
[1:47:23] THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS SENT TO BREAK
[1:47:26] EVERY BONDAGE in the name of Jesus
[1:47:28] Christ.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:32] And I would pray Lord that you would go
[1:47:33] even beyond the walls of this building.
[1:47:38] Go out into the utter other parts of the
[1:47:40] world Lord where the hearers are
[1:47:43] listening and where they are praying and
[1:47:46] where they are standing at this moment.
[1:47:48] Make them fill that room I pray.
[1:47:52] Father go beyond
[1:47:55] into the regions of the darkness.
[1:47:58] Oh shepherd, there are lost ones that we
[1:48:02] are praying for. They're bound. They're
[1:48:06] bound with chains and feathers. Oh God,
[1:48:09] WE SEND NOW OUR PRAYER. Send your
[1:48:13] presence to them. SEND YOUR PRESENCE. Oh
[1:48:16] God, SEND YOUR PRESENCE. BREAK THE YOKE.
[1:48:20] BREAK THE YOKE OF SIN. BREAK THE YOKE of
[1:48:22] evil habits. BREAK THE YOKE OF SATAN
[1:48:26] UPON THEIR lives in the name of Jesus.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Let their lips begin to speak
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; things of truth.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Let their heart be opened and let the
[1:48:42] son of righteousness shine in
[1:48:45] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:48:49] for your glory.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; For your glory.
[1:48:54] for your glory. We give you all the
[1:48:56] praise and the glory.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, we give you all the praise and the
[1:49:00] glory.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; I believe it would be appropriate for us
[1:49:04] to thank him,
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; to enter into worship, to his
[1:49:09] in his august presence.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:49:16] I so thank you. Thank you for the
[1:49:18] testimony I was able to give. Thank you
[1:49:21] for what you're doing, Lord, in the
[1:49:22] homes, in the families, in the hearts.
[1:49:25] Thank you for what you're doing, oh God.
[1:49:27] Oh God, continue, Father. Continue.
[1:49:31] Continue. I pray
[1:49:34] these that are have stood and saw. Lord,
[1:49:38] I saw him stand him instantly.
[1:49:41] Meet my brother. I pray, oh God, that
[1:49:46] let him know that he shall go out of
[1:49:48] this place having received what he came
[1:49:51] in for. What caused him to rise
[1:49:55] so quickly?
[1:49:58] Let him receive that answer for every
[1:50:01] person. Every person. I pray for them
[1:50:04] now in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[1:50:08] wonder if you're standing by someone
[1:50:10] who's standing.
[1:50:12] Why don't you lay your hand on them?
[1:50:15] Just lay your hand upon their shoulder.
[1:50:19] Say, "Oh God,
[1:50:21] I do this." This example was also given
[1:50:24] to us by our messenger. I pray for this
[1:50:27] one. I pray, oh God, that the very thing
[1:50:32] that they have stood for will now be
[1:50:36] banished. Oh God, the very thing that
[1:50:39] they stood for will be answered in the
[1:50:43] name OF JESUS CHRIST. LET THE church of
[1:50:45] the living God enter into their
[1:50:48] inheritance
[1:50:49] and receive the full benefit
[1:50:54] in Jesus name.
[1:50:57] In Jesus name. Hallelujah.
[1:51:00] Let deaf ears be opened. Let our minds
[1:51:04] be enlightened.
[1:51:09] Hallelujah.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[1:51:27] Every
[1:51:30] fetter
[1:51:33] Jesus break
[1:51:42] every feather and he sets
[1:51:48] me
[1:51:50] free.
[1:51:52] I will shout hallelujah.
[1:51:55] Oh,
[1:52:04] heat,
[1:52:14] heat.
[1:52:19] Hallelujah.
[1:52:24] For he set
[1:52:28] me
[1:52:31] free. Jesus breaks every feather.
[1:52:35] Jesus breaks
[1:52:38] every
[1:52:39] everything every
[1:53:04] and he
[1:53:15] could ask our brother Mike Gier if
[1:53:16] you'll come here please. Brother Mike,
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; are you born again?
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; That's good. Are you born again?
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; The very breath of God produced that.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Wasn't the breath of a preacher. It's
[1:53:43] the breath of God
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; produced that.
[1:53:47] Amen.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; It's something to be born of God.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; And it's something to know that you've
[1:53:52] come. I want you to go out of this place
[1:53:55] today saying that great
[1:54:00] our father.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Father, I I was in your bosom.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; I was some there with a host of people.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; I was in your bosom. Amen.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; And then out from there I came.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; I'm in a little short journey
[1:54:22] and I'm on my way back.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, that can just be a revelation to
[1:54:31] you. I came out of the bosom of Almighty
[1:54:35] God. I'm here on a little short JOURNEY
[1:54:39] AND I'M ON MY way back.
[1:54:44] Let's thank him.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; I'm on my way back.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; To the bosom of God.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; GODL.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; NOT DEATH.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; NOT THE GRAVE.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; NOTHING CAN OVERCOME THAT.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; WELL, that's what we have to know.
[1:55:14] I want you to early early this morning
[1:55:17] in the wee hours. I was going over this
[1:55:20] song and I said to her, I want to sing
[1:55:22] it. I thought it was in the song book.
[1:55:24] My wife said, "No, that's a song that
[1:55:26] Brother Mike sang." So, that's how it
[1:55:29] impressed me, Brother Mike. And so, I
[1:55:31] want want you just to help take a
[1:55:33] microphone, would you?
[1:55:34] And we want to
[1:55:37] you know which one it is? Yeah. Well,
[1:55:44] I don't know what parts I can tell you
[1:55:46] the parts that really were already. Who
[1:55:49] is worthy?
[1:55:52] Four and 20 elders and four living
[1:55:54] creatures. 10,000 times thousands. Here
[1:55:58] we are.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:01] Sing around the throne.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Friends, we don't have this opportunity
[1:56:09] down the street or when we're out.
[1:56:11] You're going to go and have a bite to
[1:56:12] eat. You won't have this opportunity in
[1:56:15] the restaurant. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT NOW
[1:56:17] AND HERE. ENJOY THIS ATMOSPHERE.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You won't scare me.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; You won't scare YOUR NEIGHBOR.
[1:56:29] YOU BELIEVE it's over.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; THE YOKE IS BROKEN. Death is conquered.
[1:56:35] Jesus is alive and he's here.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Listen friends,
[1:56:53] I see we all have our coats and our
[1:56:55] clothing intact. Before he died,
[1:57:00] before he raised,
[1:57:03] before he SHOWED HIMSELF ALIVE, THEY'RE
[1:57:06] TAKING OFF THEIR COATS, throwing it on
[1:57:09] the ground,
[1:57:11] spreading it so the donkey could run
[1:57:12] over it, WAVING HOSANA, HOSANA. SAID,
[1:57:17] TELL THEM TO KEEP QUIET. IF THEY KEEP
[1:57:19] STILL, THE STONES will cry out.
[1:57:25] He didn't say the stones will whisper.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; SOME SOMEBODY SAYS GOD ISN'T DEAF AND
[1:57:34] YOU CAN'T MAKE HIM DEAF EITHER.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE HEAVEN IS FULL OF NOISE,
[1:57:42] REJOICING,
[1:57:43] SINGING, MUSIC.
[1:57:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:55] Let's worship.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Put the microphone up close and just get
[1:57:59] out the volume.
[1:58:04] Who is worthy?
[1:58:09] You open
[1:58:11] up
[1:58:13] the book.
[1:58:16] Where's the words? The answer comes
[1:58:20] back.
[1:58:22] No one's worthy.
[1:58:26] Oh, through heaven
[1:58:29] and earth
[1:58:31] we love.
[1:58:35] No apostle
[1:58:38] or prophet
[1:58:40] or priest
[1:58:42] nor king
[1:58:44] even on
[1:58:47] these pages.
[1:58:49] love. Oh, hallelujah. Come on, John.
[1:58:58] Worthy.
[1:59:02] The lamb
[1:59:11] for 20 elders
[1:59:16] four
[1:59:17] living creatures
[1:59:20] 10 thousands
[1:59:22] times thousands
[1:59:24] of angels
[1:59:27] sing
[1:59:31] and blessing
[1:59:33] And on earth,
[1:59:36] power
[1:59:37] and glory they sing worthy
[1:59:42] the lamb
[1:59:44] that was save
[1:59:48] for the life
[1:59:50] of tri
[1:59:52] of Judah
[1:59:57] has
[1:59:59] Praise
[2:00:01] his name.
[2:00:06] John knew
[2:00:08] all was lost. If no one's worthy
[2:00:14] when I prefer
[2:00:28] redeemer
[2:00:29] praise his name to lose our sins and all
[2:00:34] those mysteries.
[2:00:38] Have you seen it all day
[2:00:45] for the land
[2:00:49] and he
[2:00:51] took
[2:00:57] the book from the hand
[2:01:01] of his father
[2:01:05] said I
[2:01:08] to set them free.
[2:01:12] Hallelujah.
[2:01:15] four and 20 elders
[2:01:21] living creatures
[2:01:23] and thousand
[2:01:25] times thousands
[2:01:28] of angels
[2:01:30] sing
[2:01:36] and honor
[2:01:39] power
[2:01:40] and glory
[2:01:42] they sing worthy.
[2:01:45] the lamb that was slain.
[2:01:51] But the lion
[2:01:55] of Judah
[2:01:59] has
[2:02:02] praise his name
[2:02:08] for the lion
[2:02:10] of the tri
[2:02:12] of
[2:02:17] every Yeah.
[2:02:25] Heat.
[2:02:44] Hallelujah.
[2:03:08] the lion of the tribe of Judah.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; I think Satan thought he almost had it
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; when Judah wouldn't give
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; his last son to Tamar.
[2:03:23] And the ancient Nian's father said that
[2:03:27] TAMAR SHE SCOFFED AS IT WERE at the
[2:03:31] burning.
[2:03:33] SHE HAD NO THOUGHT ABOUT BEING STONED.
[2:03:37] SHE CARED NOTHING about that she must
[2:03:40] bring forth. IT WAS CHRIST
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; PREVAILED.
[2:03:47] HALLELUJAH.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; THE TRIBE, THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF
[2:03:49] JUDAH PREVAILED.
[2:03:52] And then all of the prophets all down
[2:03:54] THROUGH THE AGES. EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMED
[2:03:56] AS THOUGH
[2:03:58] THERE WAS PARTIAL VICTORIES AND THE
[2:04:00] PEOPLE GO INTO BONDAGE AND GO INTO
[2:04:02] SLAVERY AND GOD'S PEOPLE LIKE IT ALMOST
[2:04:04] EXTINGUISHED in Egypt, but the lion of
[2:04:08] the tribe of Judah prevailed
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; and the line kept coming on down.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; And the people kept, you know, THINKING
[2:04:20] ABOUT THIS GOD AND EVERY PROPHET DIED
[2:04:22] AND THEY died and they died.
[2:04:25] No one had the key to come out. But
[2:04:29] finally, one
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; entered into a new tomb. And he had the
[2:04:34] key to come out. He was the anointed
[2:04:37] one.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; WHAT BROUGHT HIM OUT? THE WORD.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; THE WORD TOOK HIM IN. AND THE WORD
[2:04:42] BROUGHT HIM OUT. THE ANOINTED WORD.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:49] Praise the Lord
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; for the lion
[2:04:54] of the tribe
[2:04:56] of Judah
[2:05:00] has prepared
[2:05:03] praise
[2:05:06] and lifted up to Lord
[2:05:28] Dear heavenly father,
[2:05:33] so many times I do not even feel worthy
[2:05:35] to call upon you, but you have made us
[2:05:41] accepted in the beloved.
[2:05:44] And today
[2:05:46] I can say within the hearing of these
[2:05:50] people,
[2:05:51] we have a sacrifice that's been found
[2:05:54] perfect.
[2:05:55] Our Lord Jesus Christ was examined.
[2:05:59] And through this next week that we are
[2:06:02] having as a memorial and remembrance,
[2:06:05] he was held up and examined.
[2:06:08] And he was found perfect.
[2:06:12] It wasn't only Pilate who could say, "I
[2:06:14] find no fault in this man."
[2:06:17] But you looked upon him.
[2:06:20] YOU WERE SATISFIED WITH THE SACRIFICE.
[2:06:24] YOU WERE PLEASED WITH THE SACRIFICE.
[2:06:27] And sin's grip was broken over the face
[2:06:31] of the earth. And man could come now to
[2:06:34] full redemption. And here we are
[2:06:37] standing today at the end of the ages as
[2:06:40] it were
[2:06:42] almost
[2:06:44] feeling like we're on the balcony
[2:06:47] looking into eternity
[2:06:50] standing here in time but we're leaning
[2:06:53] forward. We're looking over the
[2:06:55] banisters at where and we see a great
[2:06:59] eternal horizon that is risen Lord. We
[2:07:02] hear marvelous words that come to us
[2:07:06] through the prophetic voice that you
[2:07:08] sent. We hear descriptions of you, oh
[2:07:12] God,
[2:07:13] that no one seems to be able to to say
[2:07:17] it like that. AND WE HEAR GLORIOUS
[2:07:20] things about your bride. Lord, we
[2:07:23] identify ourselves with that those
[2:07:26] descriptions.
[2:07:27] I pray that you will go with these
[2:07:30] people. And I ask, oh God, if there's
[2:07:35] any person that yet has been untouched
[2:07:39] and do not feel that moving within them,
[2:07:43] I ask Lord that you will
[2:07:46] deal with them in such a way. Move close
[2:07:49] to them. Lord,
[2:07:52] make yourself so
[2:07:54] present with them and set up a hunger
[2:07:57] and a desire within their heart. Lord, I
[2:08:00] pray
[2:08:02] I pray that there will be a great great
[2:08:06] transformation.
[2:08:07] Some here need it more than others.
[2:08:10] Lord, I just pray they'll identify it
[2:08:13] where that's why we preach. That's why I
[2:08:15] preach this morning. Lord, I've done
[2:08:17] what I could do. Now take it I pray and
[2:08:21] do the supernatural with it I ask in the
[2:08:24] name of Jesus Christ dismiss us now Lord
[2:08:28] with your grace
[2:08:31] your blessings I pray. Amen.
[2:08:35] Amen.
[2:08:36] God bless you name of our Lord Jesus
[2:08:39] Christ. Lord willing, we'll see you this
[2:08:42] evening. And our brother Lance Laroo as
[2:08:45] we're preparing,
[2:08:47] waiting on God for the service tonight.
[2:08:50] You will enjoy it. Amen. God bless you.
[2:08:53] You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:09:06] Heat. Heat.
[2:10:09] Amen.
[2:10:45] Christ
[2:10:49] my Just holdj
[2:11:12] of the spirit. And so Lord, you open the
[2:11:15] way
[2:11:36] in every situation
[2:11:40] and lead him and trust him.
