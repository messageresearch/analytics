we'll welcome you holy spirit pray father that you have your way tonight that you take the word and you'll break it all god that you feed the people father we are hungry people father we don't feed upon what men say we feed upon the word of god so i pray father that you take your word may you transform it into faith and substance into revelation to our souls lord god we commit the hearers and the speaker into your hands for your glory in jesus name we pray amen man let us turn to the word let's go into matthew chapter 16. verse 13 to 14. when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say i the son of man am and they say some say that our john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah's or one of the prophets let's also turn back to matthew 11 verse 6. and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me amen let's pray heavenly father this is a terrible place to stand the lord we're just following you tonight father i pray o god that you help me tonight that you call my nerves lord as i'm prepared as i may feel lord god but that you can take the word of god and meet the need of your people for it is for the people that will come here tonight lord it's our love for the people to be able to see something that can help somebody love you more that can help somebody know you better lord that can help somebody be edified and establish in a relationship with you that's our desire lord so i pray that you take the word of god that you breathe life into the scriptures or god that we can go back home knowing that you've spoken to us knowing that something of eternal value was deposited in our souls that's our prayer tonight in the name of jesus christ as we read your word it to our hearts bless it make make it come alive in jesus name we pray amen and you have your seeds all right we're going to go straight into the world tonight i don't know how long i'm going to be hopefully not too long i just want to be precise and to achieve the purpose of the goal that i have today and the burden that's on my heart i'm going to start by reading uh brother brown amir makes a statement in god hiding himself in simplicity he says and we know that god is so great till we expect it to be some great something and we miss the simple thing we stumble over simplicity that's how we miss god is by stumbling over simplicity god is so simple until the scholars of these days and all these so he said the scholars of these days and all days miss him a million miles because in their intellect they know that there is something like there's nothing like him so great but in his revelation he makes it so simple that they go plum over the top of it and miss it so prabhupada is saying that the scholars not just in these days so if you could if you can take how god deals with humanity throughout the ages from the old testament to in this day the reason why people miss it is because of their intellect and they miss it because god in his revelation he makes it so simple and just as a disclaimer tonight god cannot be known by intellect let me just stop by saying that laying that down there is absolutely no way god can be known by intellect scholars miss him because of intellect and that's the reason why the pharisees and israel missed him and we understand that through the scripture brotherhood shows that how they were blinded but what what was the reason why they're branded it's not like they had like a spiritual blindfold right but the the reason why they're blinded is because in how god fulfills his word it is so radically different that the intellectual conception that is what blinds with people is when god does something in a way that they do not expect brother one says in recognizing your day and his message he talks about in the days of noah he says they didn't know the day they didn't know that's the reason why they missed it it's because they did not recognize it they were like today he says like somewhat like people today blinded by scientific proofs by educational systems by theological seminaries and things that blinded them in that day it's exactly the same thing today it's blinding them again so seminaries theological scientific proofs is what actually blinds people right so you can you can actually preach the word and god's absolute truth to people if they're looking away from an intellectual point of view if they want everything to be scientifically proven before they believe they will never meet god god can never be known that way and we have to be careful as believers not to fall into this trap to attempt to convince people of god's truth by intellectual reasoning because god's word comes to you by revelation alone [Music] in in chapter 16 of matthew as we just read and i left that one verse on purpose but we're going to go back to it after verse 15. but in verse 13 and 14 what i wanted to show you here especially verse 14 it says some say that our john the baptist some say the true elias and others say that to jeremiah's or one of the prophets some some others right it means that concerning who christ was there wasn't a consensus of opinion concerning who christ was there was a disagreement right and the reason why there's a disagreement because in its nature itself the word of god is controversial and something that's controversial is something that gives or that's likely to give rise to public disagreement it's something that is contentious something that is disputed something that is an issue that's debatable and something that's controversial speaks of an expression of opposing views on a given subject so as you can see here when jesus asked who did who did they say that i am some say some say and others say different opinion about the same person christ because in his nature christ himself is controversial which means that if you bring a subject or it's something that's controversial if you bring a topic in a group of people like tonight and you ask people for their opinion they'll all have different opinions right and what makes something controversial is that there is valid arguments in those pausing views right and if you if you're actually going to search on google as a deal a few a while back about controversial subjects to today in the 21st century even in 2021 and you'll find such as like you know the second amendment you find something like like pro-choice pro-life abortion gay marriage transgender all those issues are issues that are actually controversial issues and the reason why these topics are controversial okay i just started my stop watching now i forgot so i don't know how long i've been but the reason why these issues are controversial is that if you bring people together and ask them to debate on it they have valid arguments on both sides we need oxygen to breathe that's not a controversial issue right like we all agree that oxygen is needed to breathe you can take somebody somewhere in the world who says i don't need oxygen and you can write on every newspaper on the planet nobody will give it any credit but that is not a controversial point of view because generally we all agree that oxygen is needed to breathe so what makes something controversial is that people actually have valid arguments the intellect they have valid reasoning as to why this subject can go either way and another thing that makes something controversial is that the topic in question has high stake right it's something of importance like pro-choice pro-life that's that's something that is very high stake so it is important enough that it is controversial you know if if i prefer apple juice and you prefer orange juice that's not controversial we're not going to have a debate about it right the stakes are not high maybe for you but another thing is that the gap in perspective must be significant so if we slightly disagree it's not really controversial it must be that this is what i believe versus this is what you believe right that is what actually puts somebody or puts the topic as label something that's controversial now breitbart is still showing us that the book of genesis itself is a book of seeds so everything that you find today you have to go back to the book of genesis so we found that the serpent and eve had a radical different view of what the fruit was even knew what god said to do and the serpent said well god didn't say it to do that there is an opposing view about what the fruit was or if they were allowed to have it that was controversial and now even till this day there's a controversy around the original sin we understand that people say well it was fruit and if you follow that raw some say it was an apple an apricot a pear right but some will say that no it was actually a relationship in the garden of eden that was what the original seed is and they don't agree right and serpent seed itself now if you're looking at it from an intellectual point of view it's a controversial subject but to you and it's not because it is revealed so there's three main purposes that i'll try to achieve tonight my title is the word is controversial and for a subject i like to speak on looking beyond the offense three main purposes number one is the word of god is controversial by design and what i mean by design is that it is intentional so there's an intent beyond how the word comes across god intends it to be a specific way so that it all right so that it provokes different opinions about it because god doesn't want people to come to him on the basis of understanding in the mental intellect he wants people to come to them on the basis of revelation number two that we are meant to know god by revelation only not here revelation number three is revelation is sovereign so in matthew chapter 11 verse 6 as we read jesus said blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and i said it's an interesting thing and rabbi picks it up in a forgotten beatitude and he talks about that and he says oh my and blessed is he who's not offended me don't be offended i believe there's more people offended in jesus than any other person that's ever lived on earth think about it right you can think about all the politicians today or all the historical figures that have lived throughout the ages nobody was more offensive than jesus christ people were more offended in jesus than in anybody else who's ever lived and we know that jesus is the word so the word is a reason for offense people are more offended in the word than in any other thing but surprisingly christianity there's 2.5 billion creases on the face of the earth today ask yourself why why is it that back in the days of christ he was rejected he was crucified but today's 2.5 billion can look back and say oh i believe in him he was the son of god that's religion because what has happened is that religion has painted a sunday school version of jesus christ they painted a jesus who loves everyone a jesus whose message is love your neighbor be kind be good be humble and jesus that was persecuted and hated for no reason jesus who was just hating for absolutely no reason he died on the cross for our sins he rose again sent the holy ghost sitting on the throne pleading for our sins every day you can fall and sin all you want he loves you he forgives you all the time this is a palatable version of jesus christ the easiest pill that anybody can swallow today then that's because religion's mandate is to build communities and you can easily build a community on this type of jesus on this historical jesus christ who is love everybody that type of jesus christ that everybody hate him for no reason but actually when look in the scripture there was a valid reason why he was crucified it wasn't just like oh people were so unfair to him no people look at the law of moses and according to the law they had to put him to death so they're hiding the fact that there was a certain element about his ministry that i was offensive and the painting a christ that anybody can love but god's mandate is not to build communities god's mandate is to build a church is to call out a people that they can reveal himself to and brave obama talks about any christian mystery of god reveals that his purpose was to reveal himself god is not interested necessarily in your feelings so god will say something a certain way and you won't care that it's going to offend you because his interest is to reveal himself to you and truth can be offensive sometimes but the predestinated seed can look beyond your face [Applause] [Music] romans chapter 9 we're going to go through a couple of scriptures here verse 31 to 33. paul says but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained the law of righteousness it says in verse 32 wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled upon that stumbling stone as it is written behold lay in zion a standing stone and a rock of offense and whosoever shall believe on him shall not be ashamed what is paul saying here is that israel stumbled upon this rock because the scripture had to be fulfilled god laid in zion for a foundation a stone he put a stone inside in zion that is a stumbling stone what does it mean it means if you're a runner and you're running there's something on your way that causes you to stumble and fall and god said i am the one who laid a stumbling stone in zion this is not the devil's doing this is intentional by design god lays a stumbling stone so that when people come and try to run this race if they're not predestinated seed this stumbling stone stops them dead truck in the tracks but you and i we can look beyond the offense you can lay down every stumbling stone we will look beyond each one of them and run this recipe perseverance do not take the offense out of the world do not take the shame that is attached to this gospel outside of the gospel because when you render it without effect you've taken an aspect out of it don't preach jesus that is easy to accept and swallow preach the word exactly the way it is because we are looking for that predestinated sin that can look beyond your face matthew 15 verse 10 to 13 and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defile of a man but that which cometh out of the mouth for the file of a man then came his disciples and said unto him no that the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father have not planted shall be rooted up so here are the disciples coming to jesus christ and they're saying hey the things that you're preaching don't you know that it's offending people his response was oh really his response was not well maybe i should take part two of the service and make myself a little bit more clear he's responsible no no no that's not what i meant let me actually explain to you let me give you something that's easy to swallow no that wasn't his response his response was through the offense god will root up every plant that he is not planted the disciples saying the pharisees are offended and his answer is that every plant which my father had not planted shall be rooted up the reason why people offended and the reason why the word of god is in such a way to offend people is that god has to unplug every planet that he did not plant we don't want to have a bride of jesus christ that is not a pure bride so god will send off his word and design it intentionally in a certain way so that those who cannot look beyond the offense will be offended and removed and what stays still act matthew chapter 13 verse 54 to 58 and when he was come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue in so much that they were astonished and said once at this man his wisdom and this might works it's not this carpenter's son he's not this he's not his mother called mary his brother james and and john and simon and judas and his sisters and they're not all with us once then if this meant all these things verse 57 and they were offended in him but jesus said unto them prophet is not without honor saving his own country in his own house they were first astonished by his doctrine by his teaching they were the marvelous they were amazed by it but when they looked at the man christ we know this man we know his parents we know his brothers we know his sisters we know where he grew up now how can this man say these things see what offended them was a human element wasn't the doctrine necessarily though the doctrine can be offensive as you will see but in this verse it's because they look at jesus the man they could not go beyond the man and that was the stumbling block that god almighty veiled himself into a blood cell and came and walked on earth like a human being they could not swallow the fact that almighty god was in that flesh so the human element is what offended them see to not be able to look beyond the human element and see god is to be a pharisee i think i spoke this in victoria i say if you're not able to look past your brother's humanity and flesh you are a pharisee because that is the pharisees is the kunosi garden flesh is stumbled as a human element if you cannot look past the veil and see god you are a pharisee john chapter 6. 51-69 actually let's turn to that together i am the living bread starting with verse 51. i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any men eat of this bread shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world the jews therefore stroke among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he shall have no life in you my first he said that he's the living bread and that the bread that he gives is his flesh and the jews the the jews were offended by it and decided thinking how he's gonna give us his flesh instead of making things better he makes things worse right he says verily verily i say unto you except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you whosoever eateth my flesh and drink of my blood have eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eaten my flesh and drink up my blood and dwell up in me and i in him as the living father has sent me and i live by the father so he that eat of me even shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever now it says in verse 60 many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it verse 61 when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before my he's talking about eating is he talking about him being the manna the living bread people offended it says that offends you let me carry on unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me and then the disciples are asking this is a hard thing says are you offended wait until you see the son of man he's just going to say i'm going to offend you more and more and more he's not even trying let me explain everything's better he just keeps on preaching the word and oh i skipped here sorry verse 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then say jesus unto the twelve will you also go away then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life even the disciples that follow jesus christ they got offended by the preaching of the word and christ did not try to make it more palatable for them he didn't try to soften things up for them to swallow it he kept on preaching and preaching and preaching and then the bible says from that time on many disciples no longer work with him why because they could not look beyond the offence let's look into matthew chapter 26 verse 31-34 or 35 rather then said jesus unto them all these shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee never will i be offended and jesus said unto him verily i say unto you that this night before the cockroach thou shalt deny me thrice peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise all see all the disciples even jesus is telling his own 12 disciples that left he says even you this very night you'll be offended peter said not me i will never be offended on all the disciples says me neither not me i'll never be offended but they were paul says in first corinthians chapter 1 verse 21 to 23 it's a lot of scriptures tonight i just have to lay this down verse 21 of first corinthians chapter one for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that belief verse 22 for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumbling block and unto the greeks foolishness what is paul saying here paul is saying that the jews search after miracles and signs they want to see signs and science the greeks love wisdom which is intellectual reasoning they want to be able to understand and reason and that's why you see in the book of acts when paul wants to the greeks that's all they did is they debated in the debate and debate and reason they want the stimulation of the intellect like oh let's put the scriptures together oh let's step in shadow that's what the greeks wanted but paul said it's not what i wasn't preaching what the jews wanted i didn't prefer the greeks wanted i preached christ crucified and he said to the jews it was a stumbling block and to the greeks it was foolishness so the things that we're preaching and believing to many people it ought to be foolishness and stumbling block we're not believing in the gospel that makes sense we're believing the gospel that is revealed and the reason why it makes scriptural sense to us is by revelation not here if you're an intellectual the only thing you can do the most sensible thing you can do is to reject it and you'll be right because intellect ought to reject the word of god the only thing that can accept god's word is revelation [Applause] as robert obama says that the importance of revelation can never be overemphasized that means on wednesday and sunday and wednesday and sunday we can preach revelation every service we will never over emphasize it because revelation is the only way the only way to know god [Music] if you're believing in the message i'm jumping ahead of myself because somebody put the scriptures together so perfectly that you saw the church ages yeah i see it okay i see every every age has a messenger okay i see brother branham okay i see sons and wonders in the sermon oh yeah he must be perfect i believe oh my you'll be deceived because what anchors the soul of a believer is revelation the word and the message of your day has to come to you by divine revelation if it doesn't come that way after five years after 10 years after 40 for some you'll find yourself back why because intellectual reasoning will fail sons and wonders are not going to hold you forever but revelation upon this rock i will build my church and the death of help can never prevail against revelation it will prevail against your intellectual understanding it will provide you some mental conception and understanding it will provide just your signs and your wonders and your discernment but it will never prevail i got something that god from heaven deposited in your soul [Applause] oh my that is why sometimes even when things go hard in life and you ask yourself maybe i'm deceived why am i doing this why am i in this message like i'm just gonna leave it but something in your soul holds you firm because what calls you is divine revelation hallelujah all brothers and sisters i cannot emphasize on this you need this message to become a personal revelation to you [Applause] [Music] now the word offend has read in matthew 11 verse 6 blessed is yours not offended to me it means scandal israel that's right there which means a scandal which means it's a stumbling block or an impediment in the way to cause somebody to trip and fall it causes a person to begin to distrust and desert one whom they ought to trust and obey it causes somebody to find in him something that you disapprove and it hinders you from acknowledging his authority think about it so because christ is in offense people found in him something that they could not approve of and it's the thing that they found in the word and i'll say in the message of the day is what they found in the message that they could not approve of and it hindered them from acknowledging the authority of the world it means that there was a stumbling block something that was put on the way to make them trip and fall it's by design intentional people will come and believe the word of the hour believe intellectually they will understand it they will follow it for a year for five years for 10 years but soon enough for some maybe 50 years they'll even preach the message for 40 years some of them but one day they will find something in the message or in the messenger that they disapprove of and because they found that thing they can no longer accept the authority of the word and god said yeah i put that in there for you i put that in the world so that one day you will be offended and you will live it because i've designed my word in such a way that my predecessor sin can never be offended not in the word and not in a messenger [Applause] if you're going to believe the word of god for your day you're going to have to accept and all to the shame that comes with it that's what it is if you call us of a disciple of jesus christ you have to own to what jesus christ says you've made you're walking are you a follower of jesus yeah that man was born of illegitimate birth yep that man is a man that i follow oh yeah the man that your mom uh his mom marry had had a relationship outside of marriage is that a man i don't care what to say but that is the man that i'm following you believe in jesus christ yeah i believe in him the man who wants you to pull up bethesda and saw children that were sick and walk past them and stop people with cancer and walk past them and some people cry for mercy and walk past them and when i heal just one person what kind of mercy is that yeah it's that man that i follow yeah you don't have to make it beautiful you don't have to make it put a bouquet around it so that they can accept it or not up to it let's order it to him yep i believe in the message yeah i believe in brother burnham that man from kentucky yep that's the man who i believe in the man who said this is about women yeah that's him that i believe the man who said this and that yeah that's the man that i believe because he's the prophet of god our own to whatever shame comes with believing in god's word don't try to change it own up to it embrace it you could not preach the cross of christ without preaching without it coming with a shame think about it paul said it multiple times in the scriptures preaching the cross foolishness foolishness stumbling block foolishness you believe in jesus christ yeah the man that was hanged naked on the cross yep it wasn't like oh praise the lord i'm a message believer i believe in jesus christ oh are you a christian oh yes jesus christ is my lord it wasn't like that it was oh are you one of those who follow jesus me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's me well did you know that jesus said if my freshman drink my blood yep did he explain it no so you believe in a man who's asking people to actually eat his flesh and drink his blood yup it wasn't about well to be fair he never quite really explained it maybe give him another chance come to the next service my message it will be clear own up to it is that what he said if you say that i believe it [Applause] because in you the predestination see it there is nothing to be offended oh my hallelujah i'm thankful tonight that god has placed something in me that can look beyond your face others will look at something and stumble i'll look at him like nope doesn't bother me somebody will look at something else and stumble and fall i look at me it doesn't bother me at all and i'll keep walking or fest up to offense and i'll keep walking i want you to explain it i want you to understand anything all i know is that god revealed it to me [Applause] i can't walk away from something that god made real to me i can't you can't that is why even when you backslide and you go back to nowhere for years and years and years no matter what the devil says if this message was ever to ever reveal to you once once soon enough one day something will start to turn into your heart something's up quicker than you it's time to go back it's time to go back because i know that i've left it but something tells me that that is where i belong [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah i remember in the last few days i had come to a point where there's so many scriptural discussion with people augustine the prophet and malachi 4 and like oh no that's for israel no it's for the jews oh nice for the gentiles then you go to the church ages and i found that even though i had very very good valid arguments a lot of people just couldn't get it and then you can go back home like okay i'm gonna put something together and i'm gonna lay down so perfectly they won't be able to argue so you go back and you come and you lay down so perfectly types shadows scriptures old testament new testament boom you gotta believe like i don't see it like how how then one day i was praying and the lord spoke to me and said you to stop speaking to the mind speak to your souls and i was like wait a minute that's it because if i speak to the mind they will respond from an intellectual point of view and then we have disagreements and we'll just clash but if i cannot speak it to be true if they're predestinated seed there is something in their soul that even if it doesn't make sense here it's quickened here and that's what i said to him like i'm going to tell you what god has done in this age because brother branham says that the elective of god can see the light of their day so i'm going to tell you what the light is if there's a seed in you when that light flashes it will strike that seed even if you don't understand it here either if somebody stretch you'll see that it comes alive try to stop it you can't [Music] sorry i'm just down with explanations and debates i'll just preach to you what brother bonham said i'll preach what god is doing this age if you're predestinated you will see it you might argue here you might fight it for a little bit but once it's quickened even if you cannot resolve it here you cannot get away from something that's done here and that's how i believe it [Applause] i remember once uh somebody asked brother stephen was in nigeria to ask him why isn't speaking in tongues the evidence of the holy ghost and you've heard the testimony and i was waiting for stephen to maybe you know go in the scriptures and i didn't know where he was going to go he looked at the person and said i'm not going to give you any scripture the reason why it is not the edness of the holy ghost is because god's prophet in this day has said it's not go solo that that's how i believe it i if brother branham said it i will stand by it and i would say it exactly like you said even it doesn't make sense to me here all i know is that i believe that's all i know is i believe we're going to continue talking about the ministry of jesus christ now as i said people have painted uh a sunday school version of jesus christ but do you actually know when i was doing some search in history that there was there is a group of people even till this day that believe that jesus christ has some mental health issues and i'm saying that very respectfully it's the lord that we're talking about but i just want to show you something in john chapter 7 verse 16 to 20 i'll actually just jump to verse 20. it says the people answered and said thou has the devil who goeth about to kill you so jesus is talking about you know the son of man will be killed you seek to kill me and you're like nobody's trying to kill you like you you're paranoid like check yourself man something's significantly wrong with you and psychiatry say that he he shows sign of paranoia multiple times is that he was always feeling that somebody was to get him somebody was going to betray him somebody was going to kill him he was constantly feeling threatened and they're like yeah that fits the personal paranoia this man better going to mental institution now you're a believer of jesus in those days and that is the man that you're following and the rumors in your town is that you're following a man who ought to be a mental institution does that sound like jesus easy to follow today right put yourself in those days so the reason why the disciples really followed him till the end predestinated seed that's the only way if you're honest pharisee the only conclusion you can come to is crucified jesus because right here everything he does here contradicts the bible the old testament everything he does is against reason everything is against everything you stand for so what are you gonna do crucify him it's the logical conclusion but if you're predestinated you can look beyond the offense you can bypass your reasoning you can bypass your own fears you can bypass your own reasoning because you are hooked [Applause] [Music] mark chapter 3 verse 21 and when his friends heard of it they went out to lay hold of him for they said he is beside himself and the scribes which came down from jerusalem say he hath bails above and by the priests of the devil scarcity of the devils think about it not his enemies his friends those who knew jesus his friends when they heard the things he was saying the bible says they came to lay ahold of him in other words they came to restrain him to retain him because they say he is beside himself do you know what that means it means he's crazy he's mentally insane these are his friends right you'll be like miss tonight i'm speak speaking and i say something and brother see my brother brother marcus has come like oh we apologize we're sorry like brothers it's okay let's go let's go to the back so something's wrong with brother john yeah like so he's really something has gone really wrong that's exactly what the scripture is saying while jesus is speaking his friends not his enemies his friends come to like okay well it's time to go now let's get ahold of him because he's beside himself i don't know what's wrong with him usually he's not like this usually he doesn't say things like that like okay it's time to go that is jesus that they're following is that's your sunday school jesus that's easy to swallow today no john chapter 10 verse 19 and verse 20. there was a division therefore again against the jews for he sayings and many of them said he has a devil and he is mad why hear him the amplified version says there is a division of opinion among the jews because of the words of jesus and many of them said he has a demon and he is insane he raves and rambles do you know what that means it means to talk widely and incurrently as if one is delirious or insane to talk or write at length in the confused way when they're hearing jesus speak you're like this man poor guy something has gone really really wrong with him maybe it's time to call dr rabbi to take him to his psychiatric institution let's do some damage control here this is jesus god didn't send a son of god that was just so perfectly acceptable by everyone no he let him be a certain way he let him say things a certain way he let him act a certain way so that this can happen some say that jesus had a savior's complex which is a state of mind in which an individual holds a belief that they were destined to become a savior so if you're listening to jesus talking about saving you might not giving his life and you have just attended jerusalem university and the classroom psychiatry the talking of the savior's complex this individual exhibit this type of science and then you go to a meeting and jesus is preaching and you hear what jesus is saying tends to fit the description of that electoral university what are you gonna do if the shoe fits right you're like oh i just i just heard about it in school perhaps somebody went to andrew i was in class look look at my notes this thing that jesus is telling we talked about it at university these are sons of somebody who has a savior's complex you want to stay away from that man andrew will say man i don't know it seems like you're right but i just i just can't get away from this man i just can't do it i can't like even myself i i did some research yeah you have a point i've seen it too don't worry about it i've seen it but like even one day i decided you know what i'm not gonna fall in but something in me said you gotta keep following him i cannot explain it yeah maybe i'm deceived maybe i am that's how it is to follow jesus they talk about paranoia it's an instant or thought process that is believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety and fear so to people jesus was constantly anxious he was constantly living in fear that somebody was out there together that is the jesus that they followed now today people wanted jesus but everybody can be so proud of like here's my friend jesus i follow him and be like oh i've heard so much about you oh what a wonderful man no if you're a disciple of jesus with your discipleship comes rumors mockeries shame offense all you have to do is say i believe don't try to explain it don't even try to excuse it own it now there's three categories of people that follow jesus can bring up the slideshow i'm gonna drive this home now the first slide can you see it not the title the next slide all right so there's people who followed jesus because it's all signs and wonders and i'll show you the scripture very quickly because i'm running out of time there's people that follow jesus because they have an understanding of the scriptures mentally but there's people who actually have revelation next slide and we understand but i going to show that judas had signs and wonders he saw them and he actually manifested them and judas preached the word he had the intellectual understanding of the scriptures and he preached the message but judah said no revelation next slide oh we're going for that so medication check there you go so your signs and wonders what you see is what you see with your flesh your eyes your ears and what you hear right that is what is attracting you and then in your spirit realm doesn't need to let you understand what i'm going to cause intellectual faith so when we're preaching the word you'll hear it to your ears in your body you'll that into your spirit one man you said making sense of it in your mind but then the next step is down in your soul god turns that word into revelation very quickly here in john chapter 2 verse 23 now when he was in jerusalem in the passover in the feast day many believe in his name when they saw the miracles that's why they believe that's other miracles in john chapter 10 verse 41 and 42 many resorted unto him and say john did no miracle but all these things that john speak of this man were true and merely believed on him there matthew 7 verse 28 and it came to pass when jesus said ended this thing the people were astonished at his doctrine and they believed luke 4 32 and they were astonished at this doctrine for his word was with power mark 1 222 and they were astonished at his doctrine there's people who heard jesus christ and follow him because of the signs that people heard it because the doctrine sounded good they were astonished by it and follow him body spirit but the bible says in james chapter 2 verse 19 god believes that there is one god that does well the devils also believe and tremble what belief is that right here the devil doesn't have a revelation now i'm going to skip this part but i was i was going to show you quickly here how many people actually have issues believing in the bible because the way the scriptures are panned out in a way that challenges your mental intellect and it makes it hard to actually reconcile these things and i'll give you an example god sent a prophet to david and to talk to me about to threaten him about years of famine in samuel chapter 2 or 24 verse 13 talks about seven years of famine and first chronicles 21 talks about three years of famine so how many pairs of clean animals god told noah to take into the ark genesis 6 19 says 2 genesis 7 verse 2 says 7. and who was the father of joseph the husband of mary well matthew 1 16 says it was joseph uh and another chapter verse chapter 3 verse 23 say it was hell matthew 1 16 and luke 3 23. when you look at the general of jesus christ matthew places him as a descendant of solomon son of david but luke prism is the son of nathan son of david now i'm not going to go through this book for the sake of time there's multiple scriptures and people will look at those scriptures and they will be like i can't see this bible this bible is not consistent this bible is this is bible that and brother banham says this in pride he says the holy spirit wrote the bible and is written in such a way that there is no way at all for men in his mental conception to understand what it is no matter how well you got it wrote out no matter how well you can put it together it is wrong to begin with see because it's hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent and it's a spiritual revelation he's saying that the bible is written in a certain way on purpose by design intention intentionally so that as if somebody is looking at the word from an intellectual standpoint he won't believe that is the part of the word from noah to moses to jeremiah to daniel to jesus to paul to brother branham the word is comes out in a certain way on purpose so that those who play those tapes and read those books from a mental point of view they can never see it they might sympathize and follow it for a while but they will never see it because god designs his word that way on purpose so the word creates a conflict between faith and reasoning things are said events take place scriptures are panned out in a certain way on purpose to create a radical conflict between spiritual revelation and intellect that way when the believer must willingly remove from his foundation everything else that is not divine substance because of only foundation that is safe secure and everlasting is revelation so if you've come to the message because you heard about the discernments and the healings and the diet being raised that's all good we need that or you've come because you've never understood the trinity you never agree with me and you see oh brother also doesn't agree with you like yeah it makes sense i don't believe in the trinity that's also fine but if that is your foundation god will allow things he will allow events to come by your way he will bring bring forth a win that will shake everybody that you trust until from your foundation nothing is left but revelation [Music] a wise man builds builds his house on the rock right right says in indictment paragraph 2 22 it says loving doctrine of men make denominations and dogmas better than they do the vindicated word of god say this generation of people this narration expands god's revelation in other words they reject with disdain and content so contempt talks about the feeling that a person or a thing is beneath consideration worthless or deserves no attention at all something that shouldn't be taken into account but it's disregarded what is probably what i'm saying we're living in a time where revelation doesn't matter anymore that is why he's saying that it can never be over emphasized because this world that you're living in to the religious world revelation is of no effect it doesn't matter to them all they want is to paint a jesus christ that died 2000 years ago and that retired and is sitting on the throne where's jesus christ sent back to the holy ghost and he carried on in every single day he said the word of your day till this day he sent a prophet and he sent a message god doesn't work that way this generation spreads revelation they take it out of because to them it doesn't matter how did abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice god by faith he received the revelation of the blood cain didn't get such a revelation baron says this in in the church book revelation of jesus christ and i love this cain didn't get such a revelation even though he had a commandment so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice so we know that god comes to cain and says if you do like your brother you'll be accepted which is a commandment even though he had a commandment he could never get that revelation in matthew chapter 16 where we read in the beginning and i left out verse 15 and 16. jesus said who by who say he that i am and simon peter answered and said thou are the christ the son of the living god right and jesus said flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my father who is in heaven reveals this to you now i want to show you something that's very remarkable to me at least in john chapter 1 41 i want him to go to it but andrew comes and calls peter and says come see this man that we found he is the christ so there was a certain point in peter's walk where he followed jesus because andrew told him that jesus is the christ but here in matthew 16 jesus tells us flesh and blood didn't reveal this you so peter's understanding by intellect because his brother andrew told him there is a pawn in his walk with jesus where that intellectual understanding became divine revelation and jesus said flesh and blood this is not an angel who told you this what i'm hearing now is coming directly from my father this is a revelation so perhaps you come because you understand the word that's fine but at some point in your work that mental understanding must become divine revelation the church is built on revelation but i'm going to say but you see the whole secret is the revelation that's where the trouble is people don't understand that the whole church of the living god is built upon spiritual revelation i'm just going to lay down a few quotes here on revelation problem who says the revelation of every word of god is true hang your soul on any phase of it revelation what does our soul hang on revelation that means if our soul was hanging and there was a glove beneath us of hell and burning fire and the only thread by which our soul was hanging was revelation you're secure you're safe that is what you need to hang your soul on revelation perhaps one day you'll be challenged by somebody show me the bible why you believe that and you can't do it maybe you go scripture after scripture and for every scripture they have another scripture you ought to say that is fine it's revealed to me [Applause] that's good enough that's all that matters oh i love this quote god's provided a way of healing now we can preach the word and explain the word but you have to receive the word oh hallelujah he says that's what sets it on fire brother when you receive the revelation something slips out of the unseen world yonder comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul it says now i see it your eyes brighten your lips that hung down straighten up and smile every muscle in your body seems to rejoice because something is going to happen there oh hallelujah when something comes out over brother says out of the eternality out of the eternal realm something begins to happen and through a mystical channel straight down into your soul god drops the revelation and your eyes are enlightened i can't see it oh brother team i think that's what jonathan had last wednesday when he ate of that honey he's also enlightened what happened in the eternal realm something came down in his soul and he began to smile and say if the people out of this honey they would have possessed the land by now if the people had this revelation oh hallelujah that is what is happening tonight in this service i pray that out of the eternity god will begin to open the channel and it's a mystical channel when god reveals something to you it's personal as i'm preaching this word god can be communicating with somebody one-on-one and nobody else knows anything about it because divine revelation comes into a channel directly into your soul and nobody else knows it's happening hallelujah hallelujah [Music] brother says the kingdom of god is established in the heart and soul of a man by a revelation of jesus christ you don't expect to know god by educational theology you know god by being born again new birth since the holy spirit wrote to the word of god he so entangled it in there oh my he so entangled the word and said i have hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent because it has to be revealed to babes such as we'll learn the word of god god on purpose took the scriptures he took the word he took the message and he tangled in such a way that if you come by understanding intellectually you can see it i'm sorry you won't be able to see it don't be offended when the people that you want trusted have let what you believe it's not their fault they just couldn't see it because god entangled in such a way on purpose [Music] 15 minutes i'm gonna drive this home now we're gonna close soon you see the sun seem in the way of the revelation that god has revealing to you the only way you will ever know the sun is that god has revealed them to you do you not see the message after message there's an emphasis you can only know god by revelation but i'm saying many times misunderstood and i've tried my best to explain it to the people see the reason is i can't do it it has to be revelation do not take revelation out of the word it is the most essential ingredient of the word it's not about proving it with quotes and scriptures and scriptures and i believe you ought to know the scriptures i'm not saying we don't have to what i'm saying is that what matters the most is that god has deposited something in your soul that nobody can ever take away from you [Music] that is why when we come to the service we're preaching all in what god has revealed to us we are preaching what god makes real to us but the same way we come prayerfully you ought to come to church prayerfully and say lord the word is gonna be preached don't let it stop into my mind what is just intellectual understanding but let the word of god come down in my soul and be transformed into a divine revelation because if you don't do that you're in danger of staying in church for years with a mental understanding of the message but the first thing is the seal of christ it has to be a spiritual revelation that god has given to the individual that jesus christ is a son of god calling that's right without that brother you are only impersonating is you are only pretending if the message and the word of the hour has not become a divine personal revelation you are pretending the reason why they live is because they played church for years they pretended to be believers but in their soul there was never a revelation oh my i just want to drive down home tonight revelation alone in conclusion who was back there to tell him a better way to make the world who would dare to tell him how to run his business every word of god itself is sovereign even the revelation is sovereign and this is what i wanted to get to he reveals to whom he will reveal it the very revelation itself is sovereign in god luke chapter 10 verse 21 and 22. in that hour jesus rejoice in spirit and say i thank thee o father lord of heaven and of earth that thou see these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them that jesus websites he's rejoicing in spirit it's not just uh oh that's good there's a groaning in the spirit realm and i like to think this is just me i like to think that jesus was walking and then something struck him like just god the father just dropped this revelation in his heart just dropped it right there and in that hour he rejoiced when he got it and i said oh father i thank you i just received a revelation that you have you've hidden these things from the west and the prudent but you only reveal it to bits oh my so revelation is sovereign god chooses to whom he's gonna make himself known to for for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man know what the son by the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him so now look at this those two whom things are hidden it's not because they did anything wrong those two whom things are revealed it's not because they did anything right it's god exercising his sovereignty that god is free to choose who he wants to make himself known to many of you are friends of mine that i love but there are certain things that are only open not to certain people it is my choice nothing against you it's not that i hate you it's not like you did something wrong to me he said i am a sovereign person i can choose to whom i'm going to make myself known to that is god's prerogative to choose to whom he's going to reveal himself luke 8 verse 9 and 10 verse 10 and he said unto you it is given to the mysteries of the kingdom of god unto you it is given not to everyone not to all the jews just to the disciples not to all the churches just to his bread it is given to know the mysteries of god is it fair yes it is fair first corinthians two verse seven and eight we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the foundation of the world for our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord god now my this is a dangerous situation here because if god had revealed who christ was to everyone there'll be no crucifixion so if revelation was given to everyone christ will not be crucified so it is then necessary that some people's eyes remain closed for the purpose of god to be fulfilled in us because if revelation was given to everyone cain would not have killed abel seth will not be a type of the resurrection jesus would not have died the blood would not have been shed humanity will be stuck in the limbo the bridge between man and god will still remain close the book will forever remain in the hands of god the love will not be able to claim the book and lose the seals the ramifications of giving up revelation to everybody is serious [Applause] that is why god chooses to whom he's gonna make himself known to that is why you and i we are to rejoice that we of that group of people that he selected to make himself known to [Music] then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation and we fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just an ordinary study it it's not about thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the holy ghost listen that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people and it will take one with prophetic insight it will require one with the ability to hear from god you have the ability to hear from god my sheep know my verse but what i'm saying is the revelation of the word that is what you and i have the ability to hear this revelation cannot be meant not to everyone but a special class and i'm here to tell you you are a special class don't look at your failures don't look at your flesh if this message has been revealed to you come true self-privileged [Applause] if the light of god the holy spirit ever strikes a predestinated seed whose name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world the bible says that's right the light will shine now listen you can preach to some and it seems like it's just water on a dark's back falls off but let it once shrek that predestinated seed and watch what happens something is in there right now why it's a predestinated seed coming forth it's got to come and when that light the gospel strikes it they get it it was a predestinated seat in you when somebody handed you a book of serpentine that life strike and you got it because it was a predestinated seat in you my brother while you were walking you said god why didn't you sign a prophet and when you heard about this prophet that light strike that projectionated scene and you said i get it [Applause] [Music] when that light strike little rebecca she knew something within her all had to bring her back to isaac the message of eloheeser struck rebecca beyond the physical senses beyond the senses in the spirit realm something began to roll down from eternity into her soul and brought her to isaac i was thinking this brother dan we worked on the message lab if you type a search term and if what you're searching is included in the database you get a result back correct if you put in a search term that is not in there it says no match found so for a search to be successful the search term that you're looking for must already be contained in that database so when the word is being preached it's a search going out if in you in your soul there isn't already what i'm searching for there's zero match but if there is a match it says one match found when that world came to this day god was searching when it struck your brother george it said one much fun what is structure he began there was a mass that was found for certain people there is no match because in them there is nothing oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i thank you father that you mean there was something that the world doesn't find hallelujah not because you did it not because you are good but because there's a sin of god he knew and god was sovereign enough to come to you and make himself known to you you've got what it takes to go beyond your face you are built to look beyond your face stumbling blocks are not for you therefore the ones that are going to fall away but for you there's a seat inside of you that contains a germ of life that can be quickened through the revelation of this hour and that's a house built on the rock you don't need intellect you don't need signs and miracles and wonders all those things are good but to withstand the assault of the enemy against this truth all you need is what you already got revelation let's stand [Applause] we ought to pray for revelation pray every day lord reveal yourself to me reveal yourself to me and god wants to impart his life to you oh man there's a quote that was shared with me recently that just frightened my mind a brother who talks about the joy that god has in importing his life to you oh my he he compares it to a man and a woman a man giving seed to a woman he says that is how god wants to impart his life to you more than anything he wants to be worshipped absolutely but what he desires the most is to make himself personal to you he desired it that's what brother said why do you hunger why do you thirst is your father desiring to make himself known to you to reveal himself to you god wants to give you revelation and if you don't have it pray for it unless the message of the hour and the word of god has become a personal revelation to you we have zero foundation and i'm saddened to say that you've been in a message for five five years 10 15 40 years one day after all the wins and after all the falling away and after all the events and after all the offenses you'll be tired and you go back but if it's been revealed to you even if you tried you won't be able to leave it because you're hooked by it you are addicted to the life of god how can you live it when it's a part of god himself in you i want to take this opportunity to publicly declare i stand firm on this message being god's true for this day quote me if i leave it in 10 years play this service back because i'm not going to recant what i said tonight this has been personally revealed to me as being the truth of god for this day that's my revelation get your own revelation and i just want to thank you lord for letting me hear your word what have i done to deserve nothing such glory revealed in me thanks for that special night when i saw this glorious life i came face to face with eternal life lord i thank you you didn't have to open my eyes you could have easily been passed me by oh my hallelujah [Music] heavenly father thank you for your word thank you for revelation lord we thank you for it lord oh god i pray that if there's somebody here who will still rely on a mental conception of the word who perhaps is still following after signs and wonders and after some form of simulation i pray that tonight will be the night where something solid something everlasting something real will come down into their soul god and i pray this is anybody among us who's had this revelation but who's been bombarded in their mind let them know where to stand on he said what you've already given them is more than enough and if you could give us anything more than revelation you would but you've given us revelation because the guests of hell can never prevail against revelation i commit the people into your hands lord forgive me father perhaps for not being as adequate as i wanted to be but take your word oh god make it real not a knowledge of revelations brother by themselves but let it be a revelation itself granted lord in the name of jesus christ amen for the thing [Music] amen let's sing that together i just wanna thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] message of grace [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] yes [Music] history [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] [Music] hallelujah are you thankful tonight you have to be thankful after a service like that did you enjoy that tonight amen we just so appreciate as our brother said and i underlined it revelation cannot be over emphasized [Music] and brother john covered it so well but i'll say didn't cover half of it that's how great revelation is and even just the subject of revelation it goes beyond what any preacher can preach but it was some pretty good preaching tonight on the subject of revelation [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'll take you back i'm not going to preach i wouldn't want to add anything you won't you'll want to listen to that again except the second time you want to listen to it at half speed so that you catch everything but i want to take you back to the pastor's own testimony sitting on a log with a prophet talking about serpency which he didn't see and you know you might have somebody that you know that doesn't see it yet but a prophet of god was saying to our pastor as brother biscuit said but eve said i've gotten a man from the lord and the prophet said and then what did she say in the next verse or what was the next verse and and brother biscuit says well i couldn't even remember the next verse and he says eve begot abel and or begot canaan also beget abel and he said they were twins and and
