[9:34] prayer requests we're going to take
[9:35] before the Lord and ask brother Tom to
[9:37] come take that. Uh first, an
[9:40] announcement. Um,
[9:42] a baby announcement. Brother Andrew and
[9:44] Sister Natasha Hoyer are happy to
[9:46] announce the arrival of their baby boy.
[9:48] William, born March 25th at 1:00 a.m.,
[9:51] weighing 9 lb 11 oz.
[9:55] Mother, baby, and family are doing
[9:57] great.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank the Lord.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Each one is a miracle.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Each one is a miracle. Amen.
[10:06] Uh prayer requests. Please pray for my
[10:08] sister-in-law Linda Butler. She is in
[10:11] hospital in Oklahoma with heart trouble
[10:13] and kidney shutting down. That's sister
[10:15] from sister Leverne Clemens. Also,
[10:18] please pray for brother Levi Drake. He's
[10:22] at home sick with a stomach ailment. And
[10:26] also prayer request for Sunday morning
[10:27] for Sister Rosemary, a cousin to Sister
[10:31] Angela Michel in Switzerland. She was
[10:34] healed of lung cancer three years ago.
[10:37] She is having a scan on Monday because
[10:39] of a possible brain tumor. She knows the
[10:41] church will be praying for.
[10:44] You know, we have and and she has had
[10:47] cancer before and God's healed her. And
[10:50] we've stared that enemy square in the
[10:52] face and watched them be defeated.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; We don't fear cancer this morning.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that chorus. He has
[10:59] forgiven me. As we go to prayer,
[11:03] he
[11:06] has
[11:08] for
[11:10] me.
[11:12] My sins
[11:14] have been washed
[11:17] from his memory.
[11:22] By the blood of the lamb
[11:27] at Calary.
[11:33] He
[11:35] has
[11:37] forgiven
[11:40] me.
[11:45] Amen. Let's pray.
[11:47] [Music]
[11:51] What a powerful statement, Lord.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[11:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, to know that the blood of Jesus
[11:59] Christ cleanses us from all sin.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; And we can testify this morning.
[12:08] There is power in the blood, power in
[12:11] your word, power in this message, power
[12:16] in the presence of Jesus Christ. There
[12:18] is still wonder working power this
[12:21] morning as the church of the living God
[12:24] binds their hearts together. For we know
[12:28] in the scripture it's declared,
[12:29] "Whatsoever you bind on earth shall be
[12:32] bound in heaven, so the church of God
[12:35] binds this demon of cancer." Lord, that
[12:38] our sister be free, never to be
[12:41] afflicted again. How I heard your
[12:43] prophet say, "Sister, do you believe me
[12:46] that if I pray, it will never bother you
[12:49] again?" And in the name of Jesus Christ,
[12:52] Lord, you banish that demon. And this
[12:55] morning, the church of the living God
[12:58] stands in her position, binding that
[13:00] devil, nor loosing her
[13:03] from this demon I called cancer. And so,
[13:06] Lord, those that are needy this morning,
[13:09] may we bind our hearts together. May we
[13:11] agree together. May we bind the devil
[13:14] together. And may the church of the
[13:16] living God walk in their freedom and
[13:19] liberty where in Christ has set us free
[13:22] this morning. Lord, we love you with a
[13:25] great love. And it it just seems as you
[13:27] show yourself more, we want to see more.
[13:30] We love you more. We want more of
[13:33] Christ. We want more of your love. We
[13:35] want more of your nature. We want more
[13:37] of you, Lord. And and so Lord, as we've
[13:40] come to the house of God to be
[13:41] fortified, to be strengthened, to be fed
[13:44] from the master's table, would you
[13:46] anoint the servant of the living God
[13:48] this morning? Lord God, may you open our
[13:51] ears to hear. And may Lord Jesus, that
[13:54] word become flesh within our lives. How
[13:58] we love the presence of God and to see
[13:59] the redeemed gathered this morning.
[14:02] those that are on the hookup this
[14:04] morning, internet, Lord, phone, whatever
[14:05] it be, that you will minister to them as
[14:08] you're already ministering to us here
[14:11] this morning. And so thankful for the
[14:15] blood this morning that forgives,
[14:18] cleans, washes, and builds up within the
[14:22] faith of the hearts of your people.
[14:25] Bless us now, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.
[14:30] Before
[14:34] we're seated, let's sing that chorus. I
[14:35] bless your name. I bless your name. I
[14:38] just want to worship him this morning.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't he worthy of our praise?
[14:43] &gt;&gt; He's done so so many wonderful things
[14:45] for us. It's so easy for us to close our
[14:48] eyes and raise our hands and say, "I
[14:50] bless your name."
[14:51] [Music]
[14:53] &gt;&gt; I bless your name.
[14:59] I bless your name.
[15:03] [Music]
[15:04] I give you all
[15:10] to give you praise.
[15:15] You are the life,
[15:21] the truth, the way.
[15:26] I bless your name.
[15:32] I bless your name.
[15:35] Some midnight hour. Some midnight hour.
[15:42] If you should find
[15:47] that you're in a prison
[15:53] in your mind.
[15:58] Reach out and pray
[16:02] [Music]
[16:08] and they will fall
[16:12] [Music]
[16:13] in Jesus
[16:15] name.
[16:18] Lord I bless your name. We bless your
[16:22] name this morning Lord Jesus.
[16:25] You're worthy my praise this morning.
[16:29] I give you all
[16:34] to give you praise.
[16:38] You are the
[16:44] truth, the way.
[16:49] I bless your name.
[16:54] I bless your name.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him this morning?
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Do you love one another?
[17:04] &gt;&gt; You can't love him without loving one
[17:06] another. Turn around and welcome someone
[17:07] to the service this morning. Shake their
[17:09] hand as you take your seats this
[17:10] morning.
[17:12] Like to welcome those on the internet
[17:14] that are streaming and connected. I know
[17:16] what it's like to be out on the other
[17:18] end. So, it's it's wonderful. Amen.
[17:24] Amen. Let's sing that song. The great
[17:25] emancipator. Aren't you glad that he set
[17:28] you free?
[17:29] &gt;&gt; The part I like about this song, you
[17:31] know, it said he set me free to worship
[17:33] him.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't set me free to be a bump on a
[17:35] log. He set me free to worship him.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Set me free from my complexes. You know,
[17:40] I grew up I was the one that was very
[17:42] meek, timid, sat in the corner, didn't
[17:44] want to be noticed. And then I got
[17:46] saved.
[17:48] And you know, I tried to still be that
[17:50] quiet guy sitting in the corner, but
[17:51] there's just that that fountain pushing
[17:53] up from within that you've just got to
[17:55] say, "Glory, hallelujah."
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing it together.
[18:00] [Music]
[18:07] Once
[18:09] my heart is over

[30:23] Amen. Let's just take it down a little
[30:25] bit as we turn the service to brother Ed
[30:27] and sing that chorus. When Jesus comes,
[30:29] the tempter's power is broken. You know,
[30:32] I love that song. It's a simple song,
[30:35] but when Jesus comes,
[30:38] whatever it is this morning,
[30:41] the tempter's power is broken.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; There's no demon can stand in his
[30:45] presence. And we know when the word goes
[30:47] forth, it casts out demons.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; We know that.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this together as we turn it
[30:52] over to brother Ed this morning.
[30:55] When Jesus
[30:58] comes,
[31:01] the tempter's
[31:03] power is broken.
[31:08] When Jesus
[31:11] comes,
[31:13] the tears are wiped away.
[31:19] [Music]
[31:21] He takes the earth
[31:25] and fills the life with glory.
[31:33] For all is
[31:38] when Jesus
[31:40] comes to save.
[31:44] Oh, when Jesus
[31:47] comes,
[31:49] the temp
[31:52] is broken.
[31:56] When Jesus
[31:59] comes,
[32:01] the tears are wiped away.
[32:07] [Music]
[32:08] He takes the world
[32:13] and fills the life with glory
[32:20] for all his name.
[32:24] When Jesus comes to
[32:32] &gt;&gt; I'm sure everyone here can say all has
[32:35] changed.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He made such a change in us. Amen.

[33:08] parents are here and they've welcomed
[33:11] this uh new grandbaby.
[33:14] Hallelujah.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; I think the school should get ready the
[33:19] size of this child. I think he could go
[33:22] into grade two.
[33:26] Uh and uh we'll Lord willing be
[33:30] dedicating some some of these new
[33:31] children that have just come. Those that
[33:33] have had babies recently were we're
[33:36] happy for that. What what a wonderful
[33:40] marvelous thing that children can be
[33:43] birthed into these kind of homes.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; So wonderful. God bless you. see those
[33:50] you from up Tacoma and Seattle,
[33:54] those that are streaming the services
[33:56] today and we're going to be speaking
[33:58] directly to them as well as directly to
[34:01] you.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's uh
[34:07] we we weren't having a young people's
[34:10] meeting for some time. Actually we
[34:12] merged and had uh young people's meeting
[34:15] uh young people gathering also with
[34:18] those that were gathering for prayer on
[34:20] Friday night and and uh and then there

[34:51] you young people, it has a has a real
[34:54] impact. I'm happy to hear that you're
[34:57] the one that wants to see the meetings
[34:59] happening and not not necessarily
[35:02] parents saying my young people need to
[35:04] go to young people's, but the young
[35:05] people are saying we want to have the
[35:08] services. And I just thought uh I just
[35:10] happened to open my Bible and I had one
[35:14] uh one note there and it said uh said
[35:18] this that they want to thank you for all
[35:22] the young people for on behalf of the
[35:24] young people young people's on Friday
[35:26] nights has been a tremendous blessing
[35:28] for me
[35:30] uh on those weeks when Satan pulls you
[35:34] down. I would imagine as most every week
[35:37] uh so much at school and with so much
[35:39] homework and pressure and you feel like
[35:42] you can't go on. Young people has been
[35:45] the light at the end of my tunnel.
[35:48] Amen. It's brought me back into place
[35:52] and I and lifted I feel lifted up and so
[35:56] many times I couldn't more so many times
[35:59] that I couldn't count and uh then went
[36:03] on to say
[36:06] uh what had happened in the camp uh what
[36:09] God did for this one young person in
[36:12] camp and having a and having a
[36:15] confession and testimony
[36:17] service which they had on a Friday night
[36:19] here a couple weeks ago reminded me by
[36:23] having that confession testimony
[36:25] service. Uh they said it reminded me
[36:28] exactly of what happened and brought me
[36:31] back into a victorious position. It's
[36:34] surprising how Satan can make you forget
[36:38] what God did so easily.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[36:42] &gt;&gt; And uh being able to go back to what God
[36:46] did and confess it.
[36:48] help me to say boo to the devil.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; And it's been a victory after victory
[36:54] since. Praise the Lord. And we just want
[36:56] that to continue. And I pray that all
[36:58] the young people will have that kind of
[37:01] testimony. Uh Lord willing, we will be
[37:06] uh sister Biscll and myself will be with
[37:08] the saints in Switzerland. and brother
[37:11] Kim Dingwald is and sister Hedi are
[37:13] going to come and there might and I
[37:16] think brother brother Ben and uh sister
[37:20] Beth are going to be with their family
[37:22] as well. Um, we'd like you to remember
[37:25] these meetings and if they will put this
[37:28] slide on the uh this announcement so
[37:31] that all of you that are streaming the
[37:33] service will be sure to
[37:37] if you're any part of Europe or any part
[37:40] of of uh uh even Eastern Europe, you can
[37:46] come to these meetings and we have on
[37:48] the screen there uh brother Daniel
[37:51] Cullenbrunner's name and the contact
[37:54] number for him also brother David
[37:57] Mayor's name and his contact numbers and
[38:00] you'll be able to uh contact them by
[38:03] phone
[38:05] uh register there's a very very fine uh
[38:09] it's a a campus convention center in
[38:14] Cersei uh Switzerland and it's a very
[38:17] fine facility and so we're we're
[38:21] encouraging any and all who can come to
[38:23] this meeting because many are scattered
[38:26] throughout Europe and not able to get to
[38:29] uh meetings on a regular basis. So this
[38:31] will be a real time of not merely
[38:35] fellowship but getting around the word
[38:36] and exclusively giving these days to
[38:40] hearing the word of God. Brother brother
[38:43] Murphy and sister Tracy are also coming.
[38:47] Brother Murphy has ministered there
[38:49] before, has ministered also at brother
[38:51] Gear Rudol. And so pray for Brother
[38:54] Murphy and Sister Tracy because they're
[38:56] going to go on from this this
[38:59] convention. Listen friends, it's not
[39:02] only this congregation even though we've
[39:04] had a very very integral part of the
[39:09] work in taking place in China. Let's
[39:12] always remember this. It's God who does
[39:14] the work. It's the Holy Spirit that has
[39:17] breathed upon. It's the Holy Spirit that
[39:20] gives supernatural birth to the people
[39:24] who have never heard, some of them
[39:26] perhaps never even heard the name of
[39:29] Jesus Christ. But what is happening
[39:31] there? Brother Murphy is an instrument.
[39:34] Brother Ivan is an instrument of God. uh
[39:39] brother John Lei uh who I think have
[39:41] just gone down to Louisiana to be down
[39:45] there for maybe another month or so. But
[39:48] brother but brother John Lei, brother
[39:50] John Sacker, listen God keeps a real
[39:53] good set of books. And you people that
[39:56] have gave, you people that have prayed,
[39:58] you people that have supported, not only
[40:00] here but also in the streaming
[40:02] congregation, I want you to know that
[40:05] this is an eternal work
[40:07] &gt;&gt; and we are going to rejoice not just
[40:10] these few days, weeks, months, years.
[40:13] We're going to rejoice throughout
[40:15] eternity
[40:16] &gt;&gt; with these people. How many believe
[40:18] that?
[40:18] &gt;&gt; You expect that with everything that's
[40:21] in you. And that's what encourages me
[40:23] and drives me on because this is a
[40:26] reality. Absolutely. A reality.
[40:30] Ken and Lind are also going to attend
[40:32] with us uh to the meetings in
[40:35] Switzerland. Uh when the people were
[40:37] here, they stayed at Ken and Linda's
[40:39] place and they just want them so badly
[40:42] to to come and be with them uh over
[40:45] there as well and and return some of the
[40:47] hospitality. So, we're asking you that
[40:50] you will pray. But as I've been praying
[40:52] towards the meetings in Switzerland, I
[40:55] became very impressed that God is going
[40:58] to give a special meeting here over
[41:02] Easter. I don't know what God is going
[41:05] to do, but it came so heavy on my heart.
[41:08] I became torn in my own my own feeling.
[41:11] I wanted to be here because I felt that
[41:14] God is going to do something of a
[41:16] special nature and I wanted to
[41:19] participate in it. So, uh maybe if the
[41:22] timing works out right, we'll stream the
[41:24] meetings ourselves and then we're going
[41:27] to be coming back uh back home soon uh
[41:30] after the meetings. So, that uh is
[41:34] something we ask you to pray about.
[41:37] Now, I have a a a special announcement.
[41:42] We're glad for all of you that are here
[41:44] and sorry for those that are not here. I
[41:47] talked to a couple that weren't able to
[41:49] be here this morning. They wanted to be
[41:51] here and circumstances just prevented
[41:54] it. But we have been anticipating
[41:59] and working towards uh we won't put it
[42:02] up yet, please. uh towards a new school
[42:06] building and we've been working in that
[42:09] direction for many months.
[42:12] There has been a great deal of work done
[42:16] uh towards this project over a period of
[42:19] a lot of months but the trustees of the
[42:23] church uh recently made a decision to go
[42:27] forward with the new uh school building.
[42:31] Now some details still have to be worked
[42:34] out uh at this time. Uh and then the
[42:38] commencement of the construction would
[42:40] be subject to these being worked out and
[42:43] those are uh number one would be the
[42:46] financing of phase one. Uh but
[42:49] application
[42:50] has been made since the trustees made
[42:52] the decision. application has been made
[42:56] to our bank and they have looked very
[42:59] favorable uh and have responded already.
[43:03] They look very favorable about uh
[43:05] towards giving us what would be
[43:07] necessary to uh complete phase one. Uh
[43:12] the second thing would be the contract
[43:15] uh to construct it and we have met with
[43:18] uh contractors and brother Kim Dingwall
[43:22] uh about a year ago also had some quotes
[43:25] but we are having those being revisited
[43:28] and also some new contractors are are
[43:31] being uh have have spoken to us and we
[43:35] are in the process of receiving revised
[43:38] bids.
[43:39] uh this is being worked on right now.
[43:42] The architectural plans have been
[43:45] completed and and it's quite costly to
[43:48] have that done and God moved on our
[43:51] behalf and we actually had the
[43:54] architectural plans done for about half
[43:58] of the cost of having them done. And and
[44:01] and and for spiritual Jews, that's a
[44:04] good way to do things. We really
[44:07] appreciate doing things that but God
[44:09] just puts it on the hearts of people and
[44:12] uh uh these plans are very very
[44:15] extensive. The city of Suriri require
[44:20] every last thing. I mean even to the
[44:22] type of trees that are planted out in
[44:25] front. You can't plant just what you
[44:27] want. They have the species of the tree
[44:30] and if one tree isn't exactly what they
[44:32] want, if you have something there that
[44:34] isn't what they want, they'll have you
[44:36] pull that up and put another tree there.
[44:39] So the but that they are finished and
[44:42] the city of Siri are now prepared to
[44:44] give us a building permit
[44:46] &gt;&gt; and that is a huge that takes over a
[44:49] year has taken over a year to work with
[44:52] them. Brother brother brother Kim
[44:55] Dingwal has has had a good deal of
[44:58] experience with engineering. So he has
[45:01] done a lot of the engineering,
[45:03] electrical engineering and the other
[45:05] mechanical engineering on the plans and
[45:08] that was you know free gratus as I say
[45:13] brother Kim donated his time to do that
[45:16] and if you were to see the plans it
[45:19] would be uh it would be something to
[45:22] behold.
[45:23] Um, I think maybe what we'll do is just
[45:26] show the slide and perhaps uh, Brother
[45:29] Kim could address the slides because he
[45:31] put these together. Uh,
[45:34] we could have the first one.
[45:38] All right. This is the construction.
[45:41] Brother Kim, do you want to come and and
[45:44] uh, perhaps just speak towards the slide
[45:47] themselves?
[45:49] &gt;&gt; This is the uh, building design that we
[45:51] have. And if you look at what what that
[45:53] view is that you see is if you would
[45:54] come in off 60th Avenue on the entrance
[45:57] from 60th Avenue, that's what you'd see.
[45:59] That's the end of the school building.
[46:00] The school has nine classrooms. It has a
[46:03] library, uh a computer lab, a science
[46:06] lab, a gymnasium, and a kitchen. So, it
[46:09] has we've been working constantly with
[46:11] the teachers and parents to try and get
[46:13] everything in there that we need to
[46:14] have. And uh the building is a concrete
[46:17] and steel building. It's uh it's got
[46:19] sprinklers. It's seismic rated. It's a
[46:22] computer controlled. It's energy
[46:23] efficient. And it's a little over 29,000
[46:26] square ft, which is actually bigger than
[46:28] this building.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Bigger than all of this building.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you added up everything in this
[46:33] building, and it's about 25,000. Next
[46:35] slide. So, on the first level, we have
[46:38] the uh gymnasium. Um on your left side
[46:42] is the gymnasium, which could also be
[46:44] used for functions. It seats probably
[46:46] just over 500 people. Then we have the
[46:49] primary classes, the grades one and two
[46:51] and kindergarten and preschool on the
[46:52] main level in the kitchen and admin and
[46:56] reception areas on the main floor. The
[46:58] next floor please. And then uh on the
[47:01] upper floor we have the the uh
[47:04] elementary grades 3, four, five, and six
[47:07] and the junior high which is seven and
[47:09] eight and grade nine and a library on
[47:11] that upper floor. And next year, am I
[47:14] okay, am I okay to say this, brother
[47:16] Terry, that you've added grade 10 for
[47:17] next year? Yeah. So, next year there
[47:20] will be grade 10 and the plan is for the
[47:22] following year, grade 11, and then grade
[47:23] 12. So that if your children are in this
[47:25] school, they can just stay there till
[47:26] they're done school. U the next slide is
[47:30] uh down in the basement is the science
[47:31] lab, the computer lab, and the grade 10,
[47:33] 11, 12s in the downstairs. And uh full
[47:36] washrooms with showers. Um I don't know
[47:39] for you who have this is probably the
[47:41] place to say this but you know if you've
[47:42] had a bunch of boys in fizzed and then
[47:44] coming back to the class it's really
[47:46] nice that there showers before they get
[47:47] back. So the the school has that. So
[47:49] it's it really has all the facilities
[47:52] that that we need to be able to have a K
[47:53] to2 school. So that's the building.
[47:56] Thanks.
[47:59] [Applause]
[48:00] [Music]
[48:09] I'll say that the uh school
[48:13] has been and continues to be a
[48:16] tremendous benefit and blessing to us
[48:20] as a body of believers
[48:22] and to those that have been able to uh
[48:25] send their children. But now it'll be
[48:28] able to have children from kindergarten
[48:31] through to grade 12.
[48:34] Uh I am personally committed
[48:38] to seeing the school extended from K to
[48:41] 12.
[48:43] Now it is entirely possible and within
[48:46] our grasp to complete this project. It
[48:49] is possible and uh we must not let this
[48:53] opportunity slip away from us or
[48:56] surrender up our rights to have our
[48:59] children in a holy ghost atmosphere.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; That's the way I feel about it. Uh we
[49:04] need to look inward each of us and uh
[49:09] see how God has led us. I think the
[49:13] school has been is it 16 years brother
[49:16] Terry? 16 years in its 16th year
[49:20] uh and then move forward from that call
[49:23] or from that vision. I don't think God
[49:26] changes his mind about his vision.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Uh and we we look towards that
[49:32] leadership of the Holy Spirit for the
[49:34] decisions which still stand before the
[49:38] school board, the church trustees and
[49:40] the directors of Cloverdale Bible Way.
[49:44] But we have never
[49:46] in all of our years put the church under
[49:50] a undue financial strain. I believe that
[49:54] if we give as God leads us, as we uh
[49:58] make our decisions as God lead us and
[50:00] and families and and those that are do
[50:04] not have children uh can also
[50:06] participate. I I'd like to say something
[50:08] about volunteers.
[50:11] The seats you're sitting on
[50:14] were assembled by volunteers. These just
[50:17] came like a mechanical set from
[50:20] California with the ends and the sides
[50:23] and the backs and bags of screws and all
[50:26] of these things. And the brothers who
[50:29] are here and brothers and sisters who
[50:32] are in Living Word Fellowship, they uh
[50:35] we together assembled this so we could
[50:38] have seats such as you have. the uh you
[50:42] look to the ceiling and you see uh you
[50:45] know that was not a simple ceiling and
[50:47] we were not expert or skilled
[50:50] necessarily but we learned as we went
[50:53] and had a huge huge structure in here
[50:55] that went up uh you know it's almost 28
[50:59] 30 ft up there and uh we're cutting the
[51:02] drywall
[51:04] uh and and uh this entire building
[51:07] school offices everything was done by
[51:10] the brothers. We volunteered and did
[51:12] that work. It was a wonderful way to do
[51:16] it when men were finished work of their
[51:18] normal work day, whether they got off at
[51:21] 3:00 or 4:00 or 5:00. Now, those of you
[51:25] that were active uh in this project, you
[51:28] know, but there are many who are here
[51:30] that were not, and those that are also
[51:32] streaming, but they came here when they
[51:34] were finished their work uh and worked
[51:36] till uh supper time. The sisters came in
[51:40] and had a hot meal. We w we ate for 30
[51:45] minutes and we felt that was enough time
[51:47] and went back to our job. And then when
[51:50] the person had to go whether they had to
[51:52] go at 8 or 9 or 10, the the last person
[51:57] we could work no longer beyond 11:00 and
[51:59] that's when everyone left. But then the
[52:02] next day when the uh individuals came
[52:05] back, the men sisters, we went right
[52:07] back to the same place that we left off
[52:09] the evening before and we worked about 3
[52:12] to four months here and and completed
[52:15] the inter interior of this building, the
[52:18] Sunday school rooms, a fellowship room.
[52:20] And uh and you know what? When it was
[52:23] over,
[52:24] everybody was sad. They said, "We have
[52:27] so enjoyed being together. We've so
[52:31] enjoyed working together because believe
[52:34] it or not, you get to know people at a
[52:37] at a different level than you do just
[52:39] coming to church. And it was really a
[52:41] wonderful time. So I'd like to say about
[52:44] the the volunteers that uh
[52:49] uh what was done here was so so much. I
[52:52] mean not only the drywall we did the
[52:54] painting and the doors and hanging the
[52:55] doors and the landscaping outside. uh
[52:58] there was brothers who handled big heavy
[53:01] equipment and dug trenches outside and
[53:05] uh uh so many things were took place and
[53:08] I'd like to say to this congregation and
[53:11] those that are listening because I don't
[53:13] want you to have tunnel vision you don't
[53:16] need to have children
[53:18] to see the great benefit to the bride of
[53:22] Jesus Christ
[53:23] &gt;&gt; in raising our children for the kingdom
[53:26] of God.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:28] families with or without children,
[53:31] grandparents, unmarried,
[53:34] uh single young people, you can all have
[53:38] a part uh in this what I think is a
[53:41] marvelous, marvelous work. Now,
[53:46] there are many or there may well be some
[53:50] who are even streaming the service. I
[53:52] speak to the streaming congregation
[53:54] because my vision is not just local
[53:56] here, but they they there are some who
[53:59] are streaming that no doubt would like
[54:02] to come and even give a couple weeks of
[54:05] their time in this beautiful Pacific
[54:07] Northwest and uh contribute their time
[54:10] to helping to build the school. Uh could
[54:14] the congregation here say amen? So we
[54:16] invite you
[54:18] in the name of Jesus Christ. You know,
[54:21] we just bought the camp a couple years
[54:23] ago.
[54:25] Probably something that none of you
[54:27] know, and so this will be an
[54:30] announcement for the first time. When
[54:32] the Baptist convention, they call the
[54:35] Baptist Convention, wanted to get the
[54:37] campground ready to sell, they had it,
[54:40] they had allowed it to deteriorate so
[54:42] much, so they needed workers to come in.
[54:46] They had eight workers that came in and
[54:50] and and there's all kinds of Baptists,
[54:52] thousands of them here in this area. Do
[54:54] you know where those eight workers came
[54:55] from? Texas. They all came from Texas.
[54:59] And they went through and worked. To
[55:02] them, it was a missionary project. They
[55:04] were going to the hinterlands of America
[55:07] up into Washington State and do
[55:10] missionary work amongst the natives.
[55:16] and we're so happy they did it because
[55:18] we benefited from everything they did.
[55:21] So that was fine.
[55:24] Uh do you know that there are there are
[55:27] some religious communities I won't
[55:28] mention them by name because it goes on
[55:31] the internet but there are some
[55:32] religious groups who have uh uh churches
[55:37] in this area and they call in people
[55:40] from all over the world and they will
[55:44] build a church in a week time.
[55:48] you would hardly believe, but they've
[55:51] got skilled people and they call those
[55:54] people in and they've got everything
[55:56] scheduled and they pour the cement and
[55:58] they've got walls going up. They the
[56:01] thing is it's it's it's I've I've
[56:03] actually seen I've actually watched and
[56:06] observed and day after day you wouldn't
[56:08] believe it. You see cement one day and
[56:11] about 3 4 days later they're putting
[56:13] shingles on the roof and I I can't say
[56:16] it's completely finished inside but they
[56:18] will assemble and put up a building in a
[56:20] week's time and they have men crawling
[56:24] like ants over that thing. Don't tell me
[56:27] that we can't do something.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; I believe that there are many here. Now
[56:32] there are some hurdles. Just give me a
[56:34] moment. You may we have a very very
[56:37] unique situation. We have uh a lot of
[56:41] our congregation on the US side and I
[56:44] have spoken to uh brother brother Terry
[56:48] the principal and uh the uh school board
[56:52] is well aware there are some hurdles
[56:54] that they need to overcome and I think
[56:57] that if they if they really applied
[56:59] themselves one is to have students that
[57:04] are say in the eastern part of the
[57:05] valley and at the US border And they
[57:09] just recently a 15 passenger bus has
[57:13] been donated to the church as brother
[57:15] Milco and and a partner that's working
[57:18] with him who has come here to church on
[57:20] a couple of occasions. God is dealing
[57:23] with him. But they gave this very very
[57:26] nice 15 passenger Ford bus to the school
[57:30] and so they will be able to pick up
[57:32] students where whichever route they give
[57:34] it. But if it's to go to Abbottzford
[57:36] because we got people that are maybe in
[57:39] eastern part of the valley that would
[57:41] like to send their children. In some
[57:43] cases the wife doesn't drive and the
[57:46] husband is at work. We'd be able to
[57:49] overcome that kind of a hurdle. The
[57:51] other is we they would need one or two
[57:54] uh buses at least to pick up children at
[57:58] the border providing something can be
[58:01] worked out where they can be pulled
[58:03] there and brought to church and take
[58:05] back. There are some of those things
[58:06] which need to be addressed. But I feel
[58:08] that that the school board needs to
[58:11] really apply themselves to those things.
[58:14] Another thing is sponsorship. You know,
[58:16] I'm I'm not here to uh uh I'm not here
[58:20] to Sister Biscll and I we don't have we
[58:23] don't have children or grandchildren in
[58:26] in school, but I am very very burdened
[58:29] for the school. And we have tried to uh
[58:32] sponsor children. We like to sponsor
[58:35] children. Children that have nothing to
[58:37] do with our family, but I just see, you
[58:40] know, I see different ones and and maybe
[58:42] they struggle or their parents are
[58:43] struggling and we like to see them
[58:45] sponsored. But I just said to and I want
[58:48] to say this publicly, I have never been
[58:50] approached and said, "Would you like to
[58:53] sponsor a child?" Of course, we
[58:55] sponsored children for probably the last
[58:57] 10 years, but I've never been
[58:59] approached. Would you like to sponsor a
[59:01] child? And and and I'm sure if I haven't
[59:04] been approached, you haven't been
[59:06] approached. I think that the school
[59:08] board
[59:09] the reason I'm saying this is because if
[59:11] it happens, you can blame me. But I
[59:13] think they need to appoint a brother, a
[59:16] real swave brother. In fact, as I kind
[59:18] of button one the other day, you know,
[59:21] kind of swave diplomatic type of brother
[59:23] to go and approach and and and talk to
[59:26] the people. Do you know what? It's not
[59:28] even sponsoring a child. I think they
[59:30] should have a I think they should have a
[59:32] sponsorship fund in case some want to
[59:35] come. I'm saying more about this than I
[59:37] had intended to. So, this isn't part of
[59:40] the message, but it leading into it.
[59:44] Is this all right?
[59:45] &gt;&gt; You've never heard me speak about the
[59:46] school like this, but I think that it's
[59:48] it's
[59:50] uh it's uh to have a sponsorship fund.
[59:53] There might be a single person that's
[59:54] not even married yet says, "Hey, I plan
[59:57] to get married. I plan to have kids. I
[59:59] hope somebody does this for me. I've got
[1:00:01] a few extra dollars. I'd like to pay
[1:00:03] something every month into a sponsorship
[1:00:05] fund. Maybe the school doesn't need any
[1:00:08] sponsorship this year, but they might
[1:00:10] might well need it next year.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about things. Don't
[1:00:16] don't don't don't necessarily be quiet
[1:00:18] on me because I haven't I haven't I'm
[1:00:20] going to start to preach this in a
[1:00:21] minute.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; The trustees and school board
[1:00:26] representative was there and they all
[1:00:28] were having meetings. Then they talked
[1:00:29] about, well, there's there's a
[1:00:32] possibility
[1:00:33] way out here someplace that that someone
[1:00:36] might even want to send a child that
[1:00:39] would be boarded out. And that sounded
[1:00:42] really kind of way out there someplace.
[1:00:45] Somebody sent a child to be boarded out.
[1:00:47] I let them just talk. And at the end of
[1:00:49] the meeting, I said, "Like to just say
[1:00:51] something. You are looking at a boarded
[1:00:54] out child."
[1:00:56] I was boarded out in grade four. I think
[1:01:00] I spent a little time with my parents in
[1:01:02] grade five. Then I was boarded out in
[1:01:05] grade six. I was boarded out in grade
[1:01:07] seven. I was boarded out part of in
[1:01:10] grade eight where I had to walk four
[1:01:13] miles to school and go in the dark and
[1:01:16] come home in the dark. had to water the
[1:01:18] horses before I went to school and come
[1:01:21] back in the dark and make sure there was
[1:01:23] wood and everything for and this and
[1:01:25] this couple didn't have any children.
[1:01:28] They had never known what a having a a
[1:01:30] child was. And that's where I was for 4
[1:01:32] months. I wanted to go and see my sister
[1:01:35] and there was snow and I had to walk. I
[1:01:37] had to walk nine miles to catch the
[1:01:39] mailman. You know what? It didn't hurt
[1:01:42] us. It didn't hurt me. I lived. I
[1:01:45] survived. But you know, we get too
[1:01:48] comfortable.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to use a word that brother
[1:01:52] Randy Snow uses. He says, "You know
[1:01:54] what's problem with our church, brother
[1:01:56] Ed?" He said, "They're spoiled. We're
[1:01:59] spoiled. Everything comes too easy. We
[1:02:01] just come in and it's all done and it's
[1:02:03] all fixed and sitting on seats." But
[1:02:06] somebody labored to put these seats
[1:02:07] together. Somebody screwed them all
[1:02:10] together and we struggled and we did all
[1:02:12] these things. Now maybe it's our turn.
[1:02:15] Maybe it's a turn for some that didn't
[1:02:16] have an opportunity. And I can tell you
[1:02:19] it'll be a blessing.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; It'll be a great blessing for you. And
[1:02:23] you don't have to be skilled. You don't
[1:02:25] have to be, you know, uh have some great
[1:02:28] doctorate or anything. A person just
[1:02:30] does it. Do you know that we have people
[1:02:32] right now in China who want to send
[1:02:35] their children here to come to this?
[1:02:37] They can't come, but they want to send
[1:02:39] their children here and be educated in
[1:02:42] this environment. Can you imagine
[1:02:45] because they're streaming they'll see
[1:02:47] perhaps this service says can we send
[1:02:49] our children they've been after brother
[1:02:51] Murphy to figure out some way and
[1:02:53] someplace where they can stay and I know
[1:02:55] that there's people that that are not
[1:02:57] able to be here but they would love to
[1:02:59] have their children here. So, I don't
[1:03:01] know how that might work out, but I can
[1:03:04] tell you I may not be around to see it,
[1:03:07] but if the Lord Jesus doesn't receive us
[1:03:09] out of this place, I will tell you that
[1:03:12] I believe that that school will be
[1:03:16] looking for more space.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; It'll hold about 225 students and that's
[1:03:22] that'll be about it. It's the only and
[1:03:25] I'm closing now. It's the only one of
[1:03:29] just a handful in all of North America.
[1:03:34] Over 350 million people and a few
[1:03:36] believers, but it's only one of a few in
[1:03:40] North America and it's the only one that
[1:03:42] I know of in Canada. Now, I know that
[1:03:45] some of you mothers and fathers, you
[1:03:49] homeschool your children, and I admire
[1:03:51] you for that. I think that you mothers
[1:03:54] that do that, it's a it's a sacrifice.
[1:03:57] It's a masterful job. But if if it were
[1:04:01] me and it just that's just a matter of
[1:04:03] priority now. So just a matter of
[1:04:05] priorities.
[1:04:07] Some may say, well, I I can't afford to
[1:04:10] have my children in the in the school or
[1:04:15] there are some hurdles. But if your
[1:04:19] child is put in an environment where
[1:04:22] their ears are hearing cursing and foul
[1:04:26] language and dirty jokes, what is it
[1:04:29] worth for them not to have that? Or if
[1:04:32] your child should end up doing and being
[1:04:36] something that you really would you
[1:04:40] you'd be willing to pay anything. Say,
[1:04:43] well, they got afflicted. They got
[1:04:45] influenced by the group that go to the
[1:04:48] mall or go here or go there. What would
[1:04:51] you pay then to have them under this
[1:04:54] kind of what would you pay then to have
[1:04:56] them here? That's what I think for
[1:04:58] myself that's what school is all about.
[1:05:01] And there's no guarantee they could come
[1:05:02] to Bible way Christian Academy and end
[1:05:05] up to be real or rangutangs. I don't
[1:05:07] know. There's no guarantee. But I know
[1:05:10] one thing as a father, as a parent, as a
[1:05:13] as a believer, I would like to do
[1:05:16] everything I could to see they have the
[1:05:18] right kind of atmosphere and the right
[1:05:20] kind of upbringing. And we've done
[1:05:22] everything that we could train a child
[1:05:24] in the way they should go. And uh when I
[1:05:27] was thinking of the prodal son and the
[1:05:29] father, I tell you what, the father, he
[1:05:32] never lost his confidence. He'd raised
[1:05:34] that son the way that he should be. And
[1:05:37] he came back after he ate enough of the
[1:05:40] out of the swine pen and uh all that
[1:05:45] riotous living he began to think my even
[1:05:48] my father's servants are better off
[1:05:51] because he had the right kind of
[1:05:52] upbringing in father's home. So
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; so much said
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you. And that's my thoughts on
[1:06:01] uh and I said maybe more than I I should
[1:06:04] say but I'm not sorry for it.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; All right. Oh, I'd like to just sing a
[1:06:11] song. Uh we're we're coming up now to
[1:06:14] the
[1:06:16] the uh week prior to the crucifixion
[1:06:21] and the death and the burial of Jesus
[1:06:23] Christ. And so I want to have your
[1:06:26] thoughts in that direction. I'd like to,
[1:06:28] brother Ryan, if we could just sing. He
[1:06:30] was wounded for our transgressions. He
[1:06:33] was bruised for our iniquities.
[1:06:36] Hallelujah.
[1:06:39] Hallelujah.
[1:06:40] Do you want to hear more?
[1:06:43] [Music]
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:47] God's going to do the supernatural for
[1:06:49] us. You believe that?
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. He'll do the supernatural for us.
[1:06:53] Let's just stand as we sing it. He was
[1:06:55] wounded for our transgressions.
[1:06:58] [Music]
[1:07:02] For our
[1:07:04] transgressions
[1:07:09] he will bruise for our iniquity.
[1:07:16] [Music]
[1:07:19] and surely
[1:07:22] bore
[1:07:24] our sorrow
[1:07:29] and by
[1:07:32] his stripes we are healed. Let us enter
[1:07:36] into a spirit of worship as we sing it
[1:07:38] once again. He was wounded
[1:07:42] for our
[1:07:45] transgression.
[1:07:49] He was bruised
[1:07:52] for our iniquity
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:07:59] and surely
[1:08:03] bore
[1:08:04] all our sorrow
[1:08:09] and by
[1:08:12] his stripes we are healed.
[1:08:17] [Music]
[1:08:20] We have a wonderful savior.
[1:08:28] I've had a wonderful upbringing
[1:08:31] and God has allowed me to be influenced
[1:08:34] by some wonderful people.
[1:08:37] And uh while I just spoke about the
[1:08:40] school, I was reminded while we were
[1:08:43] singing and I I I would like to just
[1:08:47] uh give a
[1:08:52] just give a compliment to my
[1:08:53] father-in-law,
[1:08:55] my wife's dad.
[1:08:57] I never had the privilege of baptizing
[1:08:59] him, but seven years before he went to
[1:09:02] be with the Lord,
[1:09:04] he u had he told us that he had given
[1:09:08] his life to Jesus Christ
[1:09:11] and uh he lived up north and we never
[1:09:13] had an opportunity to baptize him.
[1:09:17] Our Lord Jesus was mindful of him when
[1:09:19] he was hanging between life and death
[1:09:23] and spoke through a prophet with my wife
[1:09:26] standing in the shadows at outside a
[1:09:29] motel. And he just turned to her while
[1:09:32] we were greeting one another and saying
[1:09:34] farewell. He just turned to her said,
[1:09:36] "Sister Biscll, your father will be all
[1:09:38] right." And he was hanging with a
[1:09:40] massive heart attack. And God, it wasn't
[1:09:43] the healing that we were interested in.
[1:09:45] It was his spiritual life and we
[1:09:48] accepted it as he will be all right.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. When that is spoken out of the
[1:09:54] mouth of a prophet, that's how we take
[1:09:56] it. A person isn't all right if they're
[1:09:58] just healed. That's not all right.
[1:10:00] They're all right when they're all right
[1:10:02] when they're born again. And we wanted
[1:10:05] to ask him about that. But when he
[1:10:07] passed away,
[1:10:10] now he was had grandchildren. The
[1:10:12] grandchildren are all married. He has
[1:10:14] great grandchildren. But when he passed
[1:10:16] away, he had in his will listed eight
[1:10:20] children
[1:10:21] that were in far away countries. One was
[1:10:24] in Greece,
[1:10:26] some down in the Caribbean islands and
[1:10:29] places of poverty.
[1:10:32] And he'd been he'd been unbeknown to us,
[1:10:34] he'd been paying for these children
[1:10:36] education.
[1:10:38] And one of the requirements of the will
[1:10:41] that these children must be continued to
[1:10:44] be paid for until they are through
[1:10:47] college.
[1:10:48] And I tell you, God sees that kind of a
[1:10:51] request. Doesn't go up on the rooftop
[1:10:54] and and blaring it out. But God sees
[1:10:57] that kind of a request. And I think it's
[1:11:00] important for us to have a heart towards
[1:11:02] other people less fortunate than we are.
[1:11:05] I'll have you turn in your Bible,
[1:11:06] please, to John the 12th chapter. Thank
[1:11:09] you for giving me this little extra
[1:11:10] time.
[1:11:16] This is a special week.
[1:11:19] We're moving up towards uh what the
[1:11:22] world will call Easter.
[1:11:26] And uh this this week was full of
[1:11:29] events.
[1:11:30] I want to relate and refer to some of
[1:11:34] these events and I want to speak to you
[1:11:37] on this subject events preceding the
[1:11:41] crucifixion and resurrection.
[1:11:46] May God help us now. We'll be reading
[1:11:48] from John 12. Just before we read, I
[1:11:51] would like to have you pray with me.
[1:11:54] Oh father,
[1:11:56] what a time we are remembering at this
[1:11:59] hour.
[1:12:01] Lord, we're thinking of the week prior
[1:12:04] to the suffering and the judgment and
[1:12:08] the death and the burial and the
[1:12:09] resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:13] and the life that he lived before us
[1:12:17] in such a short span of time.
[1:12:21] We see that God was in Christ
[1:12:23] reconciling the world to himself. And
[1:12:26] now I pray father that we will be let us
[1:12:30] be overwhelmed
[1:12:32] at the uh at at the life that was
[1:12:35] presented and the the express image of
[1:12:39] the invisible God and the attributes. Oh
[1:12:43] Lord, I pray that you will take this
[1:12:45] service now and let my lips speak, oh
[1:12:48] God, the words that will ignite the
[1:12:51] thoughts in the hearts and souls of the
[1:12:54] people in Jesus Christ's name. I give
[1:12:57] myself entirely to you and to be an
[1:13:00] instrument in your hand. And may the
[1:13:03] people, dear Lord, be anointed by the
[1:13:05] Holy Spirit to receive in Jesus Christ's
[1:13:08] name we ask it. Amen.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the people would say,
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Starting with John the 12th chapter,
[1:13:16] first verse, we'll read. Then Jesus, six
[1:13:21] days before the Passover, if you'll
[1:13:24] notice that, please. 6 days before the
[1:13:27] Passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus
[1:13:31] uh was, which had been dead, whom he
[1:13:34] raised from the dead. There they made
[1:13:37] him a supper, and Martha served, but
[1:13:39] Lazarus was one of them that sat at the
[1:13:41] table with him. Then took Mary a pound
[1:13:44] of ointment of spikenard, very costly,
[1:13:48] and anointed the feet of Jesus, and
[1:13:50] wiped his feet with her hair, and the
[1:13:53] house was filled with the odor of the
[1:13:56] ointment. Then seth one of the
[1:13:58] disciples, Judas's Scariot, Simon's son,
[1:14:02] which should betray him. Why was not
[1:14:05] this ointment sold for 300 p, and given
[1:14:08] to the poor? This, he said, not that he
[1:14:11] cared for the poor, but because he was a
[1:14:14] thief and had the bag and bear what was
[1:14:18] put therein. Down to the 12th verse.
[1:14:22] On the next day, much people, I would
[1:14:25] like you to notice it was the next day.
[1:14:27] First, it was 6 days prior. So, now
[1:14:29] we're into the fifth day prior to the
[1:14:32] Passover. Much people that were come to
[1:14:36] the feast, they were already gathering.
[1:14:38] See? And when they heard that Jesus was
[1:14:40] coming to Jerusalem, took branches of
[1:14:43] palm trees, and went forth to meet him,
[1:14:46] and cried, "Hosana,
[1:14:49] blessed is the king of Israel that
[1:14:52] cometh in the name of the Lord." And
[1:14:54] Jesus, when he had found a young ass,
[1:14:56] sat thereon, as it is written, fear not,
[1:14:59] daughter of Zion. Daughter of Zion is
[1:15:01] Jerusalem. Behold, thy king cometh
[1:15:04] sitting on an ass's colt.
[1:15:07] I'd like to read out of Matthew 21 and
[1:15:10] verse 8.
[1:15:13] And a very great multitude spread their
[1:15:16] garments in the way. Others cut down
[1:15:20] branches from the trees and strobed them
[1:15:23] in the way. And the multitudes that went
[1:15:26] before and that followed. So he was
[1:15:30] completely surrounded. Multitudes before
[1:15:32] him and multitudes that followed. They
[1:15:35] were all crying. And they cried, saying,
[1:15:38] "Hosana to the son of David. Blessed is
[1:15:42] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
[1:15:45] Hosana in the highest." And when he was
[1:15:48] come into Jerusalem, all the city was
[1:15:51] moved, saying, "Who is this?"
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing?
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:16:08] Just let you get settled.
[1:16:12] It's amazing week.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; No week like it in history. Ever. Ever.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; In a few days,
[1:16:24] paradise is going to be emptied. Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; In a few days,
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; paradise is actually going to be
[1:16:32] emptied.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; In a few days, a resurrection is going
[1:16:36] to take place. In a few days, the dead
[1:16:41] are going to be walking through the
[1:16:42] streets of Jerusalem.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; In a few days, but there's these people
[1:16:47] are completely unaware of it. They are,
[1:16:50] for whatever reason, they are enthused.
[1:16:52] They're excited over this prophet from
[1:16:55] Nazareth. And who is this? They said,
[1:16:57] "This is Jesus of Nazareth, the prophet
[1:16:59] of Nazareth." They hadn't quite got the
[1:17:02] full revelation that he was the son of
[1:17:04] God. They hadn't got that revelation.
[1:17:07] They didn't have a revelation yet that
[1:17:09] he's the redeemer. They didn't realize
[1:17:11] that in a few days from their crying,
[1:17:14] "Hosana, hosana in the highest." This
[1:17:17] one is going to be hanging on a cross
[1:17:19] with spit hanging on his beard on his
[1:17:22] face and with the very beard torn out
[1:17:25] from him. and sitting and standing there
[1:17:28] bleeding and his ribs showing and marred
[1:17:31] more than that of any man. His visage,
[1:17:34] the scripture says, marred more than
[1:17:36] that of any man. In a few days, the
[1:17:40] justice of almighty God is going to come
[1:17:43] down in all of the wrath of of that sin
[1:17:46] could produce upon this one man, this
[1:17:50] body, this redeemer, this savior. They
[1:17:53] didn't realize it, but the scripture was
[1:17:55] being fulfilled. And brother Brandham in
[1:17:57] the in the message, what is the
[1:17:59] attraction on the mountain? He said
[1:18:01] there was no reason. I mean, the reason
[1:18:03] for all of this activity and this crying
[1:18:07] and the people being um moved, he said,
[1:18:10] why was that? Why was that happening? He
[1:18:12] said, because prophecy was being
[1:18:14] fulfilled. And you find people that
[1:18:17] don't even have a full revelation. They
[1:18:19] get moved by and swept into the the the
[1:18:24] whole fulfillment of it. It's like a
[1:18:27] being caught in the vortex. Something's
[1:18:30] happening. Brother Brandham even said
[1:18:32] about the uh people of his day and how
[1:18:35] they were crying out for revival and
[1:18:37] revival and crying out for revival
[1:18:39] because he said being Christians,
[1:18:41] there's something in them that tells
[1:18:43] them that that's supposed to happen, but
[1:18:46] they can't identify it when it comes.
[1:18:51] They didn't realize that in a few days,
[1:18:54] in a few days, the very earth that they
[1:18:58] were walking on was going to be redeemed
[1:19:02] and claimed by the creator.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? I'm saying this,
[1:19:10] friends. We're sitting here in 2010, but
[1:19:14] it's just as possible because we're no
[1:19:16] different than they are in the fact that
[1:19:19] we could also sit not fully realizing
[1:19:22] what is happening,
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; what's taking place
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; because these people, they had to, you
[1:19:28] know, fix their dinner and the mothers
[1:19:30] had to look after the children and they
[1:19:32] had the everyday things to take care of.
[1:19:34] They had to go to the well for water and
[1:19:37] all of these things and you'll go to
[1:19:39] your car and go to gas it up and get it
[1:19:41] fixed and go to your work and do this.
[1:19:44] These people had all of those things to
[1:19:45] do. So they were taken up with the
[1:19:48] natural activities of life. Not that
[1:19:51] that was bad. We need to look after
[1:19:54] those things. But we also need a special
[1:19:58] awareness that can only come by the Holy
[1:20:01] Spirit. Oh spirit of God, don't let me
[1:20:05] lose sight of the day that I'm in
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; and this critical time that we're in.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; We have received a messenger from God.
[1:20:14] We have received the spirit of Elijah.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus, this is redeemer. He had been
[1:20:21] only on the earth for 33 years. 33
[1:20:24] years. But to some of you, 33 years is a
[1:20:27] long time. But he had only been on the
[1:20:30] earth 33 years. But after it's passed
[1:20:32] and we look at it now, it was a very
[1:20:35] short sliver of time, a very brief
[1:20:37] period of time. And I can tell you when
[1:20:40] when eternity is and time is blended
[1:20:44] into eternity, I'll just say to everyone
[1:20:46] here, don't forget my words. Everyone
[1:20:49] that is seated here today, once you
[1:20:51] enter into eternity, and you you'll
[1:20:54] you'll scarcely know it. You'll you'll
[1:20:57] say you you'll come to a realization
[1:21:00] something has changed. Something's
[1:21:01] happened. Turn around and find that it's
[1:21:03] not time any longer. The time has come
[1:21:06] and you blended into eternity. These
[1:21:09] years that we look so long here is going
[1:21:12] to be a very brief time. Didn't say it
[1:21:14] didn't amount to anything.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; That trouble I went through, that trial
[1:21:20] I went through means nothing. Here I am
[1:21:23] on the other side. Glory to God. Here I
[1:21:27] am in the fullness of what God intended
[1:21:30] for me. My brother, my sister, it's
[1:21:33] worth it all. It's worth it all. It's
[1:21:35] worth every struggle. It's worth every
[1:21:37] pain. It's worth everything that we may
[1:21:39] go through. It's worth it all
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; to serve him fervently
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; with everything that we can.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Amen. There are seven feasts
[1:21:51] in the Old Testament
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; that all point to Christ.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; And don't lose me now because this ties
[1:22:01] very directly into what I have to say.
[1:22:06] And brother Brandham in the future home
[1:22:08] message because that's I'm still there.
[1:22:12] He goes back to Leviticus 23
[1:22:16] to speak about the eighth day. But I
[1:22:19] want to speak about all of these feasts
[1:22:21] because that lead up to it.
[1:22:24] And the Lord spake to Moses,
[1:22:29] saying,
[1:22:31] "Speak unto the children of Israel,
[1:22:34] and say unto them concerning the feast
[1:22:37] of the Lord, which you shall proclaim to
[1:22:40] be holy convocations,
[1:22:44] even these," God is speaking to Moses
[1:22:47] now. Even these are my feasts. Now when
[1:22:51] we think of a feast quickly,
[1:22:56] the definition of a feast in our
[1:22:59] terminology
[1:23:01] is a festive joyous meal. It's a a
[1:23:05] sumptuous feast of time of dining and
[1:23:09] generally friendship and fellowship and
[1:23:12] and it is a uh perhaps entertainment is
[1:23:15] associated with it. It's where many
[1:23:18] guests partake. It's a banquet that's
[1:23:21] characterized by tempting variety and
[1:23:24] abundance of foods and things. That's
[1:23:27] what generally what we think of a feast.
[1:23:28] But the word feast here is completely
[1:23:31] different. We think of a feast. We could
[1:23:33] say, well, it was a feast for it was a
[1:23:36] feast for a for our eyes or it was a it
[1:23:40] was a a feast for the soul. I was in an
[1:23:43] atmosphere. It was a feast for my soul.
[1:23:45] And I don't know exactly uh that the
[1:23:48] that terminology could have very
[1:23:50] different meaning for all of us here.
[1:23:54] Then the Bible tells us also that
[1:23:55] Abraham made a feast. He made a a great
[1:23:59] feast the same day that Isaac was
[1:24:02] weaned.
[1:24:03] That was a that was this kind of a
[1:24:05] feast. And then the Bible tells us also
[1:24:08] that Belshazzar
[1:24:10] had at uh in in the book of Daniel that
[1:24:13] he made a great feast. And the feast had
[1:24:16] to do with food and with wine and and
[1:24:19] all the thousand of princes that he had
[1:24:22] a thousand of his lords and he drank
[1:24:25] wine before the thousand. That was a
[1:24:27] feast. That's not the feast. That's not
[1:24:30] even what the word means. When God is
[1:24:32] speaking of the feast, speak unto the
[1:24:35] children of Israel concerning the feast
[1:24:37] of the Lord, which he shall proclaim to
[1:24:41] be holy convocations. Moses shall
[1:24:44] proclaim this to be a holy convocation.
[1:24:47] I want to say to you, I feel inspired
[1:24:49] today to say to this congregation and
[1:24:52] all who hear my voice that we have been
[1:24:55] called to a very sacred holy time. Amen.
[1:25:00] Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; This is the end time.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; These are the last days
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; and these days will never be repeated
[1:25:09] again.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; We will not walk this way again. And
[1:25:13] we're walking where we have never walked
[1:25:15] before.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; This is a holy time to God.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; And the and the scripture that's
[1:25:22] referring to feast here, the feast is
[1:25:26] and here's the full meaning of it. The
[1:25:28] feast is an appointed place,
[1:25:34] an appointed time,
[1:25:37] an appointed meeting,
[1:25:40] a sacred appointed season,
[1:25:44] or a tent, a tent of meeting, a tent, a
[1:25:49] place, a tabernacle of meeting. And God
[1:25:52] said to Moses, I'm going to give you
[1:25:54] some feasts now. And that's why he
[1:25:57] started to say on a certain day of a
[1:26:00] certain month on that day you'll
[1:26:03] commence this feast and this feast will
[1:26:05] be three days or this feast will be
[1:26:08] seven days and on the eighth day what's
[1:26:10] he talking about? He said, "This is a
[1:26:13] sacred, holy meeting, and I'm going to
[1:26:17] I'm going to meet with the people in a
[1:26:19] special way on these days and on these
[1:26:22] months and at this time because it was
[1:26:25] reflecting something to come." And the
[1:26:28] first feast was the Passover.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; It was a certain time. And in the
[1:26:35] initial Passover, God said to Moses,
[1:26:38] "Slay the lamb
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; and put the blood on the doorpost and on
[1:26:43] the lentil of the door." Not next week.
[1:26:47] Tonight.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; It was at an appointed time. You do it
[1:26:54] tonight. For I'll pass over this city.
[1:26:57] I'll pass over Egypt tonight.
[1:27:01] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; So, it's an appointed time and this this
[1:27:07] next week we will remember a very
[1:27:09] special time in history. I'm not
[1:27:12] interested in the time in history. I'm
[1:27:14] interested in this week.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in this time. We we we as
[1:27:19] believers because of the events because
[1:27:22] Israel is over there as a nation and the
[1:27:25] sixth star of David is flying and they
[1:27:28] have their money and God all these
[1:27:30] scriptures have been fulfilled. He who
[1:27:33] scattered them has gathered them back
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; and that gathering back fulfillment of
[1:27:38] that has caused my heart to burn caused
[1:27:41] every believer's heart to burn. And we
[1:27:44] watch God's time piece with eagerness to
[1:27:47] see what is the next event. What is the
[1:27:50] next thing that's going to unfold? Where
[1:27:52] are we at? I can tell you we're in a
[1:27:54] very sacred time. Amen.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; I want to refer to some of these special
[1:28:02] times,
[1:28:05] a most sacred appointed season that soon
[1:28:09] was arriving that the Passover speaks
[1:28:11] of.
[1:28:14] And Jesus 6 days before the Passover
[1:28:18] came to Bethany where Lazarus was which
[1:28:21] had been dead whom he raised from the
[1:28:23] dead.
[1:28:26] In Matthew 26 it said, "And he said, go
[1:28:29] into the city to such a man and say unto
[1:28:33] him, the master saith, my time is at
[1:28:38] hand. I will keep I will keep the
[1:28:41] Passover at thy house with my disciples.
[1:28:46] There had never been a meeting Passover
[1:28:50] like this one.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; This was one that was different. These
[1:28:54] disciples had had church all the time
[1:28:57] like we do.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; They were having the Passover every year
[1:29:01] like all the Jews do. They slew a lamb
[1:29:04] every year. This was something the kids
[1:29:06] have said. I remember when my daddy did
[1:29:09] this.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; I remember seeing my mom cook the
[1:29:12] Passover uh meat. I saw them wash it the
[1:29:17] way they're doing. Every year was
[1:29:19] exactly the same. Exactly the same.
[1:29:21] We're getting ready in a few days. We're
[1:29:24] getting ready to do it again. But this
[1:29:26] one somehow was different because Jesus
[1:29:28] said, "Go into the city and you'll find
[1:29:31] a a a man will be there and tell them my
[1:29:34] Lord needs these uh these animals and
[1:29:37] bring them to me." And so they're
[1:29:39] bringing a little colt. And they set
[1:29:41] Jesus on the colt. Somehow they were
[1:29:43] excited about it. It wasn't a camp
[1:29:46] meeting, but it was a special feeling.
[1:29:48] Something something was happening. And
[1:29:50] they decided to start to take off their
[1:29:53] coat and throw their coat down and and
[1:29:56] they put Jesus on the colt and and threw
[1:30:00] their garments on and others went and
[1:30:02] tore branches down and and screaming
[1:30:04] with excitement. You talk about emotion.
[1:30:07] Hosana. Hosana in the highest.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because this was a special
[1:30:13] appointed time.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; This was the Passover. And God said,
[1:30:17] "These are my feasts.
[1:30:21] Amen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; This is a time of my meeting
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; because God was merged
[1:30:28] with humanity.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; But now God was taking his son
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; to the sacrifice.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; What a meeting.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; What a meeting.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; My friends, you and I have come to a
[1:30:42] service this morning, a meeting in
[1:30:44] Cloverdale. Bible way. This meeting
[1:30:46] would be meaningless
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; without that meaning.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Absolutely meaningless
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; without that meaning. Had God not met
[1:30:57] with humanity,
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; had he not merged with the human body of
[1:31:01] Jesus Christ and took him to the cross,
[1:31:05] we would live here in vain.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; We live here like a bunch of worms and
[1:31:09] die meaningless lives. Oh my brother, my
[1:31:13] sister, when we're not when we're
[1:31:15] thinking about when we're thinking about
[1:31:17] Calvary, we're thinking about Easter.
[1:31:18] What a great time. It was a meeting
[1:31:20] place.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; It was an appointed This is the Passover
[1:31:24] feast,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; This was the appointed time.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; So I said that this was the most sacred
[1:31:33] season
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; and it was six days before the Passover.
[1:31:37] the season was arriving, a most
[1:31:40] important season. And then Jesus says,
[1:31:43] "My hour, my time is at hand that I'll
[1:31:47] have the Passover at thy house with my
[1:31:50] disciples." Now this was the this was
[1:31:52] the appointed time. Jesus said, "Now is
[1:31:56] my soul troubled, and what shall I say?
[1:31:59] Father, save me from this hour,
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; not this year, but this hour. Now you
[1:32:08] see them. I want you to see the merging,
[1:32:10] the coming together, the it was a
[1:32:14] incredible
[1:32:16] uh climax as it were. And he says, "And
[1:32:20] for this cause I came to this hour.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; This is why I even came. This is the
[1:32:27] cause of my life
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; is to come to this hour. I say to you in
[1:32:32] the name of the Lord, you didn't come
[1:32:34] here by an accident. You didn't come
[1:32:37] here simply because your mother and
[1:32:38] father had to have children. You were
[1:32:40] sent to this hour. You were sent to this
[1:32:43] day. You were sent to hear this message.
[1:32:46] That's your cause. That's your purpose.
[1:32:49] You may be moved from different parts of
[1:32:51] the world or the different parts of the
[1:32:53] country. You're not sitting even in this
[1:32:55] church by an accident today. You're
[1:32:57] sitting here under the mandate of
[1:32:59] Almighty God because God says, "I want a
[1:33:02] meeting with you.
[1:33:07] It's going to be a different time. This
[1:33:10] going to be a different Sunday.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; It was an appointed time.
[1:33:21] It was an appointed place.
[1:33:23] And it came to pass, Luke 9:51,
[1:33:28] when when the time was come that he
[1:33:31] should be received up, he steadfastly
[1:33:35] set his face to go to Jerusalem. Now, he
[1:33:39] knows the seasons arrived. Six days
[1:33:42] before the Passover, he's telling the
[1:33:45] disciples, "Go and you'll find this colt
[1:33:48] and go to this man's place and tell him,
[1:33:50] I'm going to eat." The season had
[1:33:52] arrived. And then finally, it was the
[1:33:55] hour that arrived. I've come here for
[1:33:57] this hour. And now, now more than the
[1:34:01] hour has arrived, but my time has
[1:34:04] arrived. And the place has arrived. And
[1:34:07] he he wasn't in Jerusalem, but he set us
[1:34:10] steadfastly to go to Jerusalem because
[1:34:13] now he had to go. He was the right
[1:34:15] person.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; He was in the right season.
[1:34:19] It was in the right time and now he had
[1:34:22] to move to the right place.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you in the name of the
[1:34:28] Lord Jesus Christ, you need to know
[1:34:31] you're in the right place.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; You don't want to be here by some
[1:34:35] accident. You don't want to be here
[1:34:37] simply because, well, I I know the
[1:34:39] people are nice people. That's not the
[1:34:41] reason. We got to know we're in the
[1:34:43] right place. Amen.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; I ask God, I want to know that I'm in
[1:34:47] the right place where my life will be
[1:34:50] have the effect that you want it to be.
[1:34:52] Where my life will touch the people you
[1:34:54] want it to touch.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Is this too straight?
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't this right?
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; And he came and he set his face uh
[1:35:07] steadfastly set his face to go to
[1:35:10] Jerusalem. There was no way that they
[1:35:12] could change that. And then it was a
[1:35:15] meeting place also. It was the appointed
[1:35:20] place. The feast of the Passover is a
[1:35:23] tent of meeting. A tent of meeting. God
[1:35:27] had said to Moses regarding the
[1:35:30] tabernacle. The tabernacle was called
[1:35:33] the tent of the congregation, the tent
[1:35:36] of meeting. Because a a tent is a tent,
[1:35:40] listen now, a tent is something that you
[1:35:43] set down, you drive some stakes, and
[1:35:45] then you pull it up and move it.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; And the tabernacle in the Old Testament,
[1:35:51] the pillar of fire was over it. And
[1:35:53] while the pillar of fire stayed over it,
[1:35:56] it stayed there. But as soon as the
[1:35:58] pillar of fire began to move, the people
[1:36:01] said, "Oh,
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; gather the pans and get the kids on the
[1:36:05] camels, and we're on our way.
[1:36:08] Why? Because I saw the word
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; word moving. And when the word moved,
[1:36:15] the priests were to move behind it. And
[1:36:17] when the priests move, the congregation
[1:36:19] were supposed to move with it.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You see what I'm
[1:36:25] saying? God has an order, a divine
[1:36:28] order.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; And now this was a special meeting
[1:36:31] place. This, he said it was a tent. Thus
[1:36:35] was all the work of the tabernacle of
[1:36:37] the tent of the congregation finished.
[1:36:40] It was a transient place. The
[1:36:44] congregation, the tent of the
[1:36:45] congregation was finished. And the
[1:36:47] children of Israel did according to all
[1:36:51] that the Lord commanded Moses. So did
[1:36:55] they.
[1:36:57] And the Bible tells us the Apostle Paul,
[1:36:59] first church age messenger in 2
[1:37:02] Corinthians 5:19 to that God was in
[1:37:07] Christ
[1:37:08] reconciling the world to himself. God
[1:37:14] finally had a special meeting place and
[1:37:17] that meeting place that God was in
[1:37:20] Christ. They there was a merging
[1:37:23] together. The eternal God met in Jesus
[1:37:27] Christ as at a special meeting. Oh, God
[1:37:31] was in Christ. God had spoken earlier
[1:37:33] and said, "This is my beloved son." As
[1:37:36] Jesus came out of the water being
[1:37:38] baptized, "This is my beloved son that
[1:37:41] uh in whom I'm well pleased." On the
[1:37:43] mount of transfiguration,
[1:37:46] um Matthew 17, uh this is my beloved
[1:37:50] son. hear him.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Those were special meeting places, but
[1:37:55] there
[1:37:57] the world had never seen and will never
[1:38:00] see this day
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; where God was in Christ and took his son
[1:38:09] to the sacrifice of Calvary. God had
[1:38:12] completely merged.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I could say so many things. That
[1:38:17] is why Jesus could say my flesh is meat
[1:38:21] indeed and my blood is drink indeed. He
[1:38:25] had to come now to the tent the meeting.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in a in a water
[1:38:32] baptism message he changed his cast.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. from God to man and came down was
[1:38:41] born of a virgin Mary. And the Holy
[1:38:44] Ghost, which is God his father, that
[1:38:47] overshadowed it, came down and spread
[1:38:50] his tent and dwelt with us in the form
[1:38:54] of a man.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; God spread his tent.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; But the tent moved about.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; The tent moved from place to place.
[1:39:05] When you have a tent, it is a it's a
[1:39:07] place where you'll maybe have your meal
[1:39:09] and perhaps sleep the night and then
[1:39:11] you'll pull up the stakes and move to
[1:39:13] another place. God brought you here.
[1:39:19] [Music]
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; You are God's tent.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; The tent called Jesus Christ has gone,
[1:39:29] but you are God's tent. In 2010, you are
[1:39:34] God's tent. This Easter, don't forget
[1:39:37] God has come to a meeting place.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; And he sent Elijah to call you. He sent
[1:39:43] a message to get you, to let you know
[1:39:46] that he now was merging with you,
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; word in flesh.
[1:39:52] [Applause]
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Listen, young people, you just had a he
[1:39:58] you he had a a a camp. That's what even
[1:40:00] camp is all about. That's what these
[1:40:02] meetings are all about. Is so that God
[1:40:05] can anchor himself and that this meeting
[1:40:08] becomes more intense.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; I can tell you how intense Jesus finally
[1:40:18] with his disciples, he's moving in this
[1:40:20] week. And from the time he said six days
[1:40:23] before the Passover, in a day or two,
[1:40:27] he comes and he's so heavy
[1:40:30] and he falls.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:40:37] if it be possible,
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; let this cup pass from me.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, the one who taught his
[1:40:47] disciples, pray, thy will be done.
[1:40:51] Now he had to say it himself.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Not my will.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Thine be done.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Let the kingdom come.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done on earth as it is in
[1:41:04] heaven.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; And the will of God. And he prayed it
[1:41:09] again the second time.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Tell you what a meeting.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; What a meeting.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; You had a blessing. But maybe there's
[1:41:19] another meeting. May perhaps that
[1:41:21] meeting should be this morning.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; When you say, "I'm realizing for the
[1:41:26] first time what I'm here for.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Not here just to work
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; for an employer. I'm not here just to
[1:41:35] bring up children. I'm not here just to
[1:41:37] be a mother or a father. I'm not here
[1:41:40] just to be a student. I'm here to be the
[1:41:42] tent of almighty God.
[1:41:46] Amen.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; You young fellas understand me?
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; You understand me, young ladies?
[1:42:01] Who else?
[1:42:04] Who else is going to be God's tent?
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Who else is going to be his tent?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. They can move about in this dark
[1:42:17] and vile and wicked and unclean
[1:42:19] generation. Who else?
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Where the holiness of God can step out
[1:42:24] of the tent, can speak out of the tent.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; This week,
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; all of this happened in this week
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; just some years ago, but it's here
[1:42:41] again.
[1:42:42] Amen.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; He was rejected. You're rejected.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; He was spoken evil about you. Maybe
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; in the message indictment.
[1:43:09] He said, "Isn't that an indictment?"
[1:43:14] He said, "I want to take
[1:43:16] four words.
[1:43:20] There,
[1:43:22] the most holy city in the world,
[1:43:24] Jerusalem.
[1:43:27] They're the most religious city in the
[1:43:29] world.
[1:43:32] There they the most righteous religious
[1:43:36] people in the world at a religious
[1:43:38] feast,
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; the feast of the Passover. Here they
[1:43:42] were even celebrating that this our
[1:43:45] almighty God Jehovah has set this aside
[1:43:48] as the Passover. But they have it's
[1:43:51] escaped their mind that this is to be a
[1:43:54] meeting with them and Jehovah.
[1:43:57] And here Jehovah was indwelling his tent
[1:44:00] and they couldn't recognize him.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; There
[1:44:08] the most holy city. They the most
[1:44:11] righteous and religious people at the
[1:44:13] feast of the Passover. There the most
[1:44:16] religious spot, the most religious city,
[1:44:18] the greatest of all organizations, the
[1:44:21] head of it all. There they the most
[1:44:24] religious people in all the world had
[1:44:26] gathered from all over the world. They
[1:44:29] crucified
[1:44:31] there they crucified the most shameful
[1:44:34] death that could be a person killed
[1:44:37] could be killed naked stripped the
[1:44:40] clothes from him. He is despised the
[1:44:43] reproach. The crucifix
[1:44:47] has a rag wrapped around him but they
[1:44:50] stripped his clothes from him. The most
[1:44:52] shameful, the greatest religious city.
[1:44:55] They, the most religious people,
[1:44:58] crucified the most shameful death, him
[1:45:02] there. They crucified him, the most
[1:45:06] precious person.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say the dwelling place of
[1:45:13] almighty God. Amen.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; There
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; they
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; crucified
[1:45:23] him
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; in that week.
[1:45:35] Calvary was the appointed time and
[1:45:37] place.
[1:45:41] Calvary
[1:45:43] had the right person
[1:45:46] where God would meet man.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; And although Jesus was declared to be
[1:45:51] the son of God at his baptism, yet there
[1:45:54] was something much greater to be
[1:45:56] fulfilled in his life.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; He was the son of God at his baptism.
[1:46:00] But there was something much more. And
[1:46:02] lo, a voice from heaven saying, "This is
[1:46:04] my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[1:46:07] Please tell me Hallelujah.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; How could this small nation of
[1:46:14] Palestine,
[1:46:16] how could they have such a supernatural
[1:46:21] happening and the maniac of the
[1:46:24] Gatherines and he sent his word and
[1:46:26] healed them all and Lazarus raised from
[1:46:29] the dead and all these people healed and
[1:46:32] they reached through and touched him and
[1:46:34] demons screamed and he sent out 12 and
[1:46:36] he sent out the 70 and it swept
[1:46:38] throughout the whole country and a week
[1:46:41] before, six days before, they're crying
[1:46:44] and dancing and before him and after him
[1:46:47] and waving palms and hear the religious
[1:46:50] leaders saying, "Who is this?"
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; It only goes to show the depth
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; of darkness to an unbelieving heart.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; The depth
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; of blindness
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; to an unbelieving people.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; How could they look at him in the face?
[1:47:08] How could they have heard such glorious
[1:47:10] words? They said such marvelous words
[1:47:12] from him. Listen my brother, my sister,
[1:47:14] we are no different today. We can we can
[1:47:17] sit ho h and listen to what God said. He
[1:47:21] never and I say to you, I declared once
[1:47:23] again there never has been a min
[1:47:26] ministry in the history of the entire
[1:47:28] world from Adam to today where a man
[1:47:31] stood in front of the multitudes of
[1:47:33] people and and revealed the secret of
[1:47:36] their heart. We are the recipients of
[1:47:38] that kind of what does that do to us?
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Oh thou that dwellest intents, what is
[1:47:48] it that you are saying to us?
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; What is it that how should we be
[1:47:54] impacted
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; with this? Amen.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Thou that has sent the spirit of Elijah
[1:48:01] for the fourth time over the face of the
[1:48:04] earth, how should that affect us?
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Ask yourself, is it sufficient? Are you
[1:48:13] satisfied with the effort and the and
[1:48:17] and and and how God has moved your your
[1:48:21] own being? Are you satisfied with the
[1:48:24] degree of
[1:48:26] consecration and the degree of
[1:48:28] dedication? Or do you feel that there's
[1:48:31] something more?
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; I should be consumed with the hour that
[1:48:35] I'm in.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; I should be looking to him saying, "Oh
[1:48:38] God,
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; what is it that you'd have me to do?
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; What is it you'd have this tent to say?"
[1:48:48] Friends, I tell you, I'm way off my
[1:48:50] subject,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; but I feel compelled
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; to bring this directly from my heart to
[1:48:56] your heart, from God's heart to your
[1:48:58] heart.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; This is not just an average message.
[1:49:02] This is not an average people.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; It'll only be average if you think it's
[1:49:10] average.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; But as a man believeth in his heart, so
[1:49:13] is he.
[1:49:20] Hallelujah.
[1:49:22] Although we have had
[1:49:25] glorious experiences
[1:49:28] in God during our life,
[1:49:32] yet it is for this hour
[1:49:36] and this meeting place in Christ that we
[1:49:40] came into the world to have this meeting
[1:49:42] place in Christ. Amen.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to lose me there.
[1:49:49] How do I get into Christ?
[1:49:52] Well, by one spirit, we're all baptized
[1:49:55] into Christ.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the chosen meeting place for
[1:50:01] the ultimate union of God and man.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; In God's chosen place, the message,
[1:50:08] everything is tied to Jesus Christ.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; All the Old Testament is tied to him.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; The New Testament is tied to him.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; And the church today is tied to him.
[1:50:20] Amen.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; I ask this gathering of people which is
[1:50:23] a church. Are you tied to him?
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Inseparably tied to him.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; I'm influenced by him. His thought is my
[1:50:31] thought. His word is my thought. That's
[1:50:33] what's coursing through my veins.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go out of these doors
[1:50:37] and forget it.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; The church today is tied to him by the
[1:50:47] word of his commandments.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:49] There's not another place or another
[1:50:51] name or anywhere where God ever promised
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; to meet a man only in Christ Jesus, his
[1:50:59] chosen place of worship.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; There's where he chose to put his name,
[1:51:06] not in the church,
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; but in the son.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. And this son,
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; this son said this
[1:51:22] to a small group of people perhaps. And
[1:51:26] when you see
[1:51:29] the days
[1:51:32] of Noah,
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; once again.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Where they planted and they builded.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; And they had a great economic
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; happening in the world. But when you see
[1:51:45] it happening throughout the world
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; and when you see the days of Sodom
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; and Gomorrah
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; even thus shall it be
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; when the Son of Man is revealed.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; And now he sends you.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; A tent that was lost. A tent that didn't
[1:52:07] know which way to go. A tent that didn't
[1:52:10] know what to believe. He sent you a
[1:52:13] messenger to you personally to say you
[1:52:17] are my tent.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Now has come a different season. This is
[1:52:21] not another religion. This is not
[1:52:23] another church. Now the word of the
[1:52:26] living God comes out of the mouth of his
[1:52:28] chosen vessel to a chosen people at a
[1:52:32] chosen time at a chosen place. So that
[1:52:36] there will be a meeting with God and
[1:52:38] man.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; How can he get into you?
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; How can we be into Christ? It was Christ
[1:52:46] that was being spoken.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Christ became word.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; So the word could come into the womb of
[1:52:53] your mind and down into your soul. And
[1:52:56] then Christ is dwelling in his tent.
[1:53:01] and God and man merged again in the end
[1:53:05] time.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Now, you might say, "Well, I don't feel
[1:53:15] any different."
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, now my husband
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Do you know?
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; That a believer and an unbeliever may
[1:53:22] not feel any different
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; physically at all.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:27] But a believer and an unbeliever
[1:53:29] believes different things.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; A believer knows who he is.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; A believer knows what's in him.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; One has education in him. One has
[1:53:45] theology in him. One has something else
[1:53:47] in him. One is a skilled this, a skilled
[1:53:49] that. But a believer knows the word of
[1:53:52] Almighty God has been dispersed through
[1:53:55] the mouth of his oracle and spoken into
[1:53:58] my soul and I believe it.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; That's what makes you attempt
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; a meeting place.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:17] And I feel deeply honored and moved
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; to be speaking to those who I believe
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; are a dwelling place of the almighty
[1:54:27] God. You believe it up there in a
[1:54:30] balcony. You believe it with all your
[1:54:32] heart and soul. You are a tent
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; of the almighty God.
[1:54:38] [Applause]
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:43] Oh, I love it. Bless the Lord.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Prophet said,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; in the message, the lamb and the dove,
[1:54:57] when God
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; and Christ became one.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. When the dove came down on the
[1:55:04] lamb, when there was a meeting, when the
[1:55:06] dove came down on the lamb, the dove and
[1:55:10] he saw the Holy Spirit in the form of a
[1:55:12] dove came down on the lamb.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; It didn't come on another person. This
[1:55:18] was an appointed time
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; at the baptism of the Jesus Christ. This
[1:55:23] was an appointed person.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:30] He says, "And when the dam when the dove
[1:55:34] came down on the lamb, heaven and earth
[1:55:39] kissed each other."
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, how sweet,
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; how wonderful are those words. When God
[1:55:48] When God came down in the form of a dove
[1:55:52] and right on the lamb, it had to be the
[1:55:54] right nature, the right attitude came
[1:55:57] down on the lamb,
[1:56:00] heaven and earth kissed one another, I
[1:56:03] can't help but think in this end time
[1:56:06] when the spirit of the bridegroom has
[1:56:09] come down and called his bride out of
[1:56:11] the earth and said, "My spirit is in
[1:56:14] you." I can't help but think heaven and
[1:56:17] earth have kissed again
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; and you are part of this love affair.
[1:56:29] [Applause]
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth have embraced.
[1:56:38] [Music]
[1:56:40] not will be they are reconciled.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; A sister was standing before the
[1:56:54] prophet.
[1:56:57] And he says, "We bring our sister up to
[1:56:59] Calvary.
[1:57:02] Yonder hangs the Lord Jesus."
[1:57:05] Hey, hey,
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; this was centuries after it happened.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; He's talking as though it is happening
[1:57:14] at this moment. We bring our sister up
[1:57:17] to Calvary.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; You need to have the same spirit, the
[1:57:22] same attitude.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; The same timeline.
[1:57:26] [Applause]
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; And we bring her up to Calvary. Lord
[1:57:30] Jesus. Oh, how wonderful. standing
[1:57:32] yonder
[1:57:34] the earth beneath him
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; and the heavens above him
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; reconciling God and man together. The
[1:57:42] prophet saying we bring this sister to
[1:57:44] Calvary. We bring her to where the
[1:57:47] reconciling is taking place. And you and
[1:57:50] I walk through the earth saying the
[1:57:52] reconciliation has taken place. God and
[1:57:55] man has been united and reconciled.
[1:57:59] [Applause]
[1:58:12] I love the words that he said, "Would
[1:58:14] you listen closely,
[1:58:17] he said to this woman and he was
[1:58:20] speaking in prayer and we come in his
[1:58:23] name
[1:58:24] and what's keeping this woman from being
[1:58:27] a complete delivered servant is the
[1:58:29] devil.
[1:58:31] And there Jesus, you stripped him
[1:58:37] and you took every legal right away from
[1:58:39] him.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; And today he's only a bluff
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; and we won't receive it.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; We won't receive it. He said it twice.
[1:58:49] Because Jesus Christ, the son of God,
[1:58:52] give us the proof
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; that he told us. And I'm saying,
[1:58:55] friends, you have a whole library full
[1:58:57] of it. The living God has given us a
[1:59:00] proof.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; We don't need any more proof.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Even Tommy Osborne says, "I saw it
[1:59:08] once."
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Just once
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; and that was enough for me.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; I say if he could say that, we should be
[1:59:15] able to say the same thing. I heard it
[1:59:17] once.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; I saw it once
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; and that's enough for me.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; And he says because of Jesus Christ,
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; son of God, give us the proof that he
[1:59:35] told us
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; we could do it
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; and we believe it.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; And we take back that which he's trying
[1:59:42] to rob our sister.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Listen to the place he puts us in and
[1:59:46] put you in. I want you to be able to say
[1:59:48] it. Satan coming to you trying to take
[1:59:50] away your victory. As I heard a young
[1:59:52] person write me, you say to him, "I take
[1:59:55] it back. I take it away from you. You
[1:59:58] don't have any legal right to it.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; What I believe in my heart has already
[2:00:03] given me and empowered me over you.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; He says
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; we give her her health back.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; We take this weakness from her ankles.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; We take this blood pressure back to its
[2:00:23] normal condition. Amen.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; We're not just talking about healing,
[2:00:27] but I say that's a good proof.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; And you that may be afflicted here, you
[2:00:32] have a right to say it on the authority
[2:00:34] of God's servant. I have a right to take
[2:00:37] it back.
[2:00:39] [Applause]
[2:00:41] [Music]
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Trying to rob our sister. We give her
[2:00:44] her health back. We take this weakness
[2:00:47] from her ankles. We take this blood
[2:00:49] pressure but back to its normal
[2:00:51] condition and rebuke the devil that done
[2:00:54] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; In the light of Calvary sacrifice.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; You know I've just had a whole series of
[2:01:07] tests.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; All kinds of tests.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:17] [Applause]
[2:01:19] He's praising God for me.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Let the saints say so.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:30] [Music]
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Let her rejoice.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; I'm here to rejoice.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:01:49] Sister Lisa said, "I need to tell the
[2:01:51] church this.
[2:01:53] We're kind of private people, but I've
[2:01:55] had a whole bunch of tests, and I told
[2:01:58] you of some of them, but I've gone
[2:02:00] through something recently."
[2:02:03] And so,
[2:02:05] I went just for a simple
[2:02:08] blood test to say about the cholesterol
[2:02:11] level.
[2:02:13] And uh so the doctor he says uh you
[2:02:18] heard me say this before so I just I I
[2:02:20] need to give it continuity.
[2:02:23] He said
[2:02:25] were you sick
[2:02:27] when you had this blood test? I said no.
[2:02:30] He said you weren't sick.
[2:02:33] No. I said he said you're feeling all
[2:02:35] right? I said yeah I was feeling fine.
[2:02:37] Feeling just like I'm feeling now. He
[2:02:39] said, "Well, the white the white blood
[2:02:42] cell count is is going up.
[2:02:46] It's gone. It's too high."
[2:02:50] He said, "That's indicates something's
[2:02:52] wrong inside."
[2:02:54] Okay.
[2:02:56] He He looked at me. He's been my doctor
[2:02:57] for some years. He said, "Are you
[2:03:00] diabetic?" "No."
[2:03:04] Said, "Have you got diabetes in your
[2:03:05] family?" I said, "Well, yeah, my
[2:03:07] grandfather had it." He said, 'Well, you
[2:03:09] have it, too.
[2:03:11] Really? Yeah. He said, "You're
[2:03:13] diabetic."
[2:03:16] He said, "I want you to go back for
[2:03:17] another test, and your cholesterol's
[2:03:19] up."
[2:03:21] So, I said, "Fine." So, I went for
[2:03:24] another test,
[2:03:25] came back. He said, "Yeah, you're
[2:03:28] clearly diabetic."
[2:03:30] I said, "Well, what is this scale?" Oh,
[2:03:33] no, no. He knew where I was coming from.
[2:03:34] He said kind of the upper side would be
[2:03:36] seven.
[2:03:38] He said, "You're at 13.7.
[2:03:41] You're clearly diabetic." He said, "I
[2:03:43] want you to go here to this clinic and
[2:03:45] you'll see a diabetic nurse and then
[2:03:47] you'll go to a a nutritionist and a
[2:03:50] dietician and and then they will give
[2:03:52] you a kit and he'll start testing your
[2:03:54] blood."
[2:03:56] And uh so I said, "Okay, fine." So I go
[2:03:59] and do all that. I go and get the kit,
[2:04:02] start, and the little booklet says, you
[2:04:05] know, before and after breakfast, before
[2:04:06] and after dinner, before and after
[2:04:08] supper. So, I'm pricking my finger all
[2:04:11] the time. I had so I had to leave the
[2:04:13] pulpit here sometimes cuz I my two hours
[2:04:16] was up just before you eat and two hours
[2:04:18] after you eat. So, I had to go out and
[2:04:21] prick my finger and take the blood and I
[2:04:23] kept all the record for 26 days. And
[2:04:27] then we had an appointment with the
[2:04:28] diabetic nurse again.
[2:04:31] So we go and see her and she looks at
[2:04:33] it. She says, "Wow." She said, "Did you
[2:04:37] check your blood six times a day?" I
[2:04:39] said, "Yeah, you've got spots for it and
[2:04:42] I thought that's what I was supposed to
[2:04:43] do." Oh, she says, "That's great."
[2:04:46] Looking at this 5.9, 7.2, 6.4,
[2:04:52] 7.8, and she's going all the way. So she
[2:04:54] starts adding them all up, all the
[2:04:56] befores and all the afters and all the
[2:04:58] befores and all the afters and divides
[2:05:00] with the amount of days. She said,
[2:05:02] "That's fantastic." She said, "Whatever
[2:05:05] you're doing, just keep doing it." We're
[2:05:08] not doing anything. We're
[2:05:10] just eating like normal. We cut back.
[2:05:13] Yeah, I can't pile on as much jam as I
[2:05:15] like, but you know, so what? Can't eat
[2:05:18] as much honey as I want, but that's
[2:05:19] fine. Eat a little bit. And she says,
[2:05:22] "Now this this is fantastic. This is
[2:05:24] just perfect."
[2:05:26] I said, "That's great." Okay. So, I go
[2:05:30] back to the doctor and he said, "Why
[2:05:32] don't you have another blood test?"
[2:05:34] Okay. They're going to have another
[2:05:36] blood test.
[2:05:39] And he wants more now.
[2:05:42] So then he says,
[2:05:47] "Your hemoglobin
[2:05:51] is too far down. Something's happened
[2:05:54] with your hemoglobin. He said, "Are you
[2:05:57] bleeding inside?" I said, "I don't think
[2:05:59] so."
[2:06:00] He says, "I want you to have some
[2:06:02] tests." "Yeah, I have some more tests. I
[2:06:04] want to see because there must be blood.
[2:06:06] Even though you can't see it, there must
[2:06:07] be blood. I want you to be checked out."
[2:06:11] And because your your hemoglobin was
[2:06:14] 147, went down to 145, and then dropped
[2:06:17] to 131. And that's too low.
[2:06:21] said, "Okay." So, I go for these tests,
[2:06:25] three days of tests.
[2:06:28] They sent all the tests. I'm I'm in to
[2:06:31] see the doctor yesterday.
[2:06:35] Checked it all over. I said, "How is
[2:06:36] it?" Well, I said, "The hemoglobin's
[2:06:38] come back up." I said, "What is it now?"
[2:06:40] I said, "143."
[2:06:42] She says, "That's perfect." And uh
[2:06:46] there's no bleeding. absolutely clear
[2:06:50] and it is fine. And I'm waiting for him
[2:06:51] to say, "Why do you even come and see
[2:06:53] me?"
[2:06:54] He said, "You got sugar diabetes. I
[2:06:56] don't have sugar diabetes. Your white
[2:06:58] blood cells are way too high. Now
[2:07:00] they're perfectly normal. Now your
[2:07:01] hemoglobin's down. Now the hemoglobin."
[2:07:04] You know what I said? The devil's a
[2:07:06] liar.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; He's just a liar.
[2:07:12] If you got something bad, Brother Bram
[2:07:14] says the doctor may cut it out. You got
[2:07:16] something that's gone bad, he may cut it
[2:07:18] out. But you know something, friends,
[2:07:20] the devil would like nothing better than
[2:07:22] for him to lie to you about your
[2:07:25] spiritual walk, about where you are.
[2:07:27] He'd like to tell you, oh, what you got
[2:07:29] at camp, that's not going to last.
[2:07:33] [Applause]
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't it last?
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; You're not going to stand. Who says I'm
[2:07:42] not going to stand? Amen. Amen.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; You know, the same God that I'm
[2:07:47] referring to tonight was the same
[2:07:49] presence I felt when I was 14.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; When I was 16,
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; and my life continued on. And when I was
[2:07:56] 18, there was a special move of God.
[2:07:59] There's a special time. There are times
[2:08:01] and places where God meets you.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; We are a meeting people, friends.
[2:08:08] This is I want to say emphatically this
[2:08:12] is a season like no other season in
[2:08:14] history.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; This is a message like no other message.
[2:08:19] You will never find this kind of message
[2:08:21] anywhere. And God brought it to you.
[2:08:25] Maybe to your parents, maybe to your uh
[2:08:28] your friends, but he brought it to you.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; And he put something in your heart to
[2:08:33] say this is the truth. I don't
[2:08:36] understand everything, but this is the
[2:08:39] truth
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; and I give myself to it. I'll tell you
[2:08:42] who it is. It is the same one that
[2:08:44] walked here.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; It's the same one that rode on the
[2:08:47] donkey.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; It's the same one. He said, "When you
[2:08:49] see the days of Noah, do we see them?"
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; When you see the days of Sodom, do you
[2:08:55] see them?
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Even so shall it be in the day when the
[2:09:01] Son of Man is revealed. We've had a
[2:09:04] meeting.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; God has met us.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; And then friends, you didn't just hear
[2:09:14] about it.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; He touched you.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; You sat in a service
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; and the man of God stood behind the
[2:09:22] pullpit
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; and you the Holy Spirit spoke to you and
[2:09:26] said, "I got to do things different.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; I have to be more consecrated.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; I have to be more intense. I have to be
[2:09:33] more concerned. There's never been a
[2:09:36] week like this week.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't want you to hear this,
[2:09:44] folks.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; The devil much more. The devil doesn't
[2:09:47] want you to believe it.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; But I want you to say in your heart, not
[2:09:51] only brother Biscell, am I hearing it, I
[2:09:53] am believing it. I believe it with all
[2:09:55] my heart and soul.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; And that scoundrel will never take it
[2:10:00] from me.
[2:10:03] Hallelujah.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; How many here have ever heard of Billy
[2:10:08] Bray?
[2:10:16] Oh, we got four,
[2:10:19] five, six.
[2:10:22] My wife must be seven. I'm eight.
[2:10:24] Anyway,
[2:10:25] Billy Bray was a coal miner
[2:10:29] and God met him and converted him.
[2:10:33] But he had lived such a wicked life,
[2:10:36] such a vile life.
[2:10:38] And Satan constantly
[2:10:41] hounded him and tried to convince him
[2:10:45] that he was worthless and he was no good
[2:10:47] and he had lived so unclean and lived
[2:10:49] such a bad life. And so Satan was
[2:10:52] actually trying to get him to commit
[2:10:54] suicide.
[2:10:56] And he would be going down these shafts
[2:10:59] in the darkness,
[2:11:02] got down into the heart of the earth.
[2:11:04] And that Satan would say to him, "Just
[2:11:08] jump off.
[2:11:09] Just jump off and end it all." Because
[2:11:12] he was having such a war with the enemy.
[2:11:19] You know, it's not something to be
[2:11:20] ashamed of, but it's a reality in this
[2:11:23] time.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Suicide comes through a lot of people's
[2:11:26] minds.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; It'd be easier without it. Easier
[2:11:32] without this battle. And I'll tell you
[2:11:34] just how simple it is. Billy Bray became
[2:11:37] so wearied with it.
[2:11:40] And one day while the shaft was going
[2:11:42] down, he just spoke out to the devil and
[2:11:46] he said, "Devil, you old smutty face,
[2:11:51] you do it and see how you like it."
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; And that was the end of it.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:00] Take him to task. That may just sound
[2:12:02] like a story, but it's not a story to
[2:12:04] Billy Bray. He was in victory from that
[2:12:07] day on.
[2:12:10] like the brother down in Florida and
[2:12:12] brother brother Brown's church, brother
[2:12:16] uh Homer Brown's church. He was there
[2:12:19] and he brought his wife to church and he
[2:12:22] was so faithful wait for her out in the
[2:12:25] parking lot. Didn't want to come into
[2:12:27] church because it bothered him. He
[2:12:29] wasn't ready. He knew he wasn't ready.
[2:12:32] One sometimes occasionally he'd slip
[2:12:33] into church and sit there but he wasn't
[2:12:36] a believer. He didn't profess anything.
[2:12:38] And this one time when he was sitting
[2:12:40] there of all things at the end of the
[2:12:42] service, he just walked up to the front
[2:12:44] because he'd heard something about the
[2:12:46] coming of the Lord, something about
[2:12:47] heaven, and he knew he wasn't going to
[2:12:50] be there. And he just told the brother,
[2:12:52] told Brother Brown, the brothers that
[2:12:54] were going to pray for him. He said,
[2:12:55] "It's cigarettes.
[2:12:58] Cigarettes has kept me and bound me and
[2:13:01] and and I've never given my life to
[2:13:03] Christ because of cigarettes." And they
[2:13:06] rebuked that demon spirit and he walked
[2:13:09] out of there. But you know what? That
[2:13:12] devil doesn't give up easy. He came back
[2:13:14] with all the furer and all the lies and
[2:13:18] all the torment and and was just
[2:13:22] tormenting him terrible. So he got up
[2:13:25] and testified and this was his
[2:13:26] testimony.
[2:13:28] He said, "I was being so tormented of
[2:13:30] Satan." So he said, I told him, I said,
[2:13:33] 'Devil, you and I need to have a talk.
[2:13:37] So he says, so we got in my car
[2:13:40] and we drove and I said to the devil,
[2:13:44] look, devil,
[2:13:46] you want to smoke. Notice how wise that
[2:13:49] was. He didn't say, "I want to smoke."
[2:13:52] He says, "You want to smoke?"
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "And I'm not going to do it."
[2:13:56] So I think it's just better you go your
[2:13:58] way and I'll go my way. And that's
[2:14:00] exactly what happened. The devil went
[2:14:02] his way and he went his way and he was
[2:14:05] free from that time on.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; You need to do business with God.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful?
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe you'll need to say right here
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; after the end of this service.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Devil, you want to do it. I'm not going
[2:14:25] to.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; You go your way. I'll go my way and
[2:14:29] everything will be just fine.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:34] [Applause]
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; My time has slipped away. Can I just
[2:14:41] take a few more minutes and because I
[2:14:43] want to this is something I couldn't
[2:14:44] come to in the first first first
[2:14:47] portion of uh
[2:14:50] future home and the second one and this
[2:14:53] is this is I had some things I just want
[2:14:55] to bring.
[2:15:03] If you go to page 18 in the future home
[2:15:06] you'll read these words. I'm going to
[2:15:08] close with this, but this is to me is
[2:15:11] really wonderful. I don't have enough
[2:15:12] time to really preach the way I would
[2:15:14] like to on it. And you'll run into these
[2:15:17] words in paragraph one on page 18.
[2:15:20] Brother Brandham said, "Did you notice
[2:15:23] how Abraham
[2:15:25] when they tried to give him the land
[2:15:28] because now Abraham's wife Sarah had
[2:15:31] died
[2:15:33] and he needed a place to bury her.
[2:15:36] And now here's a I hope you can just put
[2:15:39] your thinking cap on. Will you listen
[2:15:42] real close?
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Here's a man who God promised to give
[2:15:47] this whole land.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; This is all yours. Everywhere you put
[2:15:52] your foot
[2:15:54] as far as you can see, this land is
[2:15:57] yours. What an inheritance.
[2:16:00] And now his wife dies. He doesn't even
[2:16:03] have a piece of land to bury her.
[2:16:07] And so
[2:16:10] he says to these people where he was,
[2:16:15] "Let me buy a supplicer
[2:16:18] from you so I can bury my wife." They
[2:16:23] said, "Abraham, Abraham, you're a great
[2:16:27] prince amongst us.
[2:16:29] Don't
[2:16:31] talk about buying a place to bury your
[2:16:33] wife. Choose the best. Choose whatever
[2:16:37] you would. It's yours.
[2:16:41] No, he said, "I must pay for it."
[2:16:46] Something in the father Abraham
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; saying, "I must pay for it."
[2:16:51] And what he was actually acting out was
[2:16:54] centuries later,
[2:16:57] Satan was going to take Jesus onto an
[2:16:59] exceeding high mountain.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; And show him all the kingdoms of the
[2:17:05] world.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Said, "You don't have to pay for it.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; You don't have to buy it. You don't have
[2:17:12] to go through Calvary. You don't have to
[2:17:15] suffer all these things. You just fall
[2:17:17] down and worship me. It's all yours.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon mentions it many times
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; and ties it back to this. And Abraham
[2:17:26] said, "No, I'm going to buy it."
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to buy this uh this. And this
[2:17:33] is what he said about it. Let it be
[2:17:36] known this day. He said, "I'll buy it
[2:17:38] for so many shekels of silver before the
[2:17:41] people as an end sign. It'll be a public
[2:17:44] witness. I want to do it before the
[2:17:46] people." That's why Calvary had to be
[2:17:48] out in the open up on a hill where
[2:17:50] everybody could see it as they passed by
[2:17:53] as a witness and as an end sign. Let it
[2:17:55] be known this day that I have bought
[2:17:57] this burying place, purchased it. And
[2:18:00] Satan tried to give him the kingdom
[2:18:03] which belongs to him. Now, he tried to
[2:18:05] give it to him as a gift, but he
[2:18:08] wouldn't receive it because, see, he
[2:18:10] said, uh, then Satan could still have a
[2:18:13] claim on it. Right.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; But it had to be bought.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; And he was the word in the fullness
[2:18:20] thereof. They couldn't deceive him into
[2:18:22] it. And the Bible says, "And Abraham
[2:18:24] bowed himself down to the people, even
[2:18:28] the people of Heth, and he commanded and
[2:18:30] he give them money for the field and so
[2:18:33] that he could bury his dead." And the
[2:18:36] Bible says that there was an instinct in
[2:18:38] him
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; because Job was buried there. He said he
[2:18:43] buried his sweetheart right beside Job.
[2:18:47] And then when Abraham died, he was
[2:18:49] buried there. And when Isaac died, he
[2:18:52] was buried there. And when Joseph died,
[2:18:55] carry my bones and bury me there because
[2:18:58] there was some instinct in them. We need
[2:19:01] to be in that place. That place that was
[2:19:03] purchased.
[2:19:06] [Applause]
[2:19:07] And when Jesus came, who was the son of
[2:19:09] Abraham,
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Satan tried to give him the earth,
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; but you were laying in the earth.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; The body you're sitting in was in the
[2:19:24] ground at that time. And Jesus Christ,
[2:19:28] our redeemer, said, "No, I will buy it.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; I will pay it. I'll pay the full price.
[2:19:36] I won't try to go around. I'll buy it
[2:19:39] with my own blood.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; And Jesus purchased his supplicer.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; He purchased your body.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; He purchased the graves that every
[2:19:54] believer has been buried in.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; And he purchased the resurrection place.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't just die and buy a burying
[2:20:02] place. He bought a resurrection place.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, doesn't that do something to
[2:20:10] you?
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; He paid not only for our our body, but
[2:20:14] he paid for our resurrection.
[2:20:17] [Applause]
[2:20:21] [Music]
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; Whatever.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Whatever is the price,
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; what would you give
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; for resurrection life? Right.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; If you were the Vanderbilt or the Bill
[2:20:36] Gates
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; and somebody could walk up and say,
[2:20:40] "Bill Gates, you give me your 45 billion
[2:20:45] and I will guarantee you and give you
[2:20:47] proof that you will raise again from the
[2:20:50] dead."
[2:20:52] I tell you what, friends, money is
[2:20:55] meaningless.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Material things are meaningless. I
[2:20:59] announce to you Jesus Christ
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; didn't just drop his blood on the
[2:21:03] ground. He didn't just redeem you so you
[2:21:05] could sit here in a seat. Whatever
[2:21:07] happens to you whether you live or
[2:21:09] whether you die. He paid for it.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; He paid that the Adams in your body
[2:21:14] would be changed. He paid for your
[2:21:17] resurrection.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; He paid for your salvation. And you do
[2:21:21] not belong. We are no longer a part of
[2:21:24] the kingdom of darkness. We are a part
[2:21:26] of the kingdom of his dear son.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; And that is why
[2:21:40] that's as far as I'm going to go right
[2:21:41] now. But that is why
[2:21:44] he could take it one step further.
[2:21:49] Jesus rose. He suffered. Dropped his
[2:21:52] blood. Paid for you.
[2:21:55] Brother Brandham says some things you'll
[2:21:56] never hear in your science class.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; He talks about your parents and your
[2:22:03] forefathers that were laying here in the
[2:22:06] earth that he bought.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Your body,
[2:22:12] your mothers when you were yet in the
[2:22:14] womb, they ate food.
[2:22:18] The cattle came from the earth.
[2:22:21] The vegetables came from the earth.
[2:22:24] The fruit came from the earth.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; The earth gave you the body you're
[2:22:29] sitting in today.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; It's another form of what God said, "Let
[2:22:35] the earth bring forth."
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; You came forth as part of that.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; When the blood of the lamb of God
[2:22:44] spilled down onto the ground, the Romans
[2:22:46] didn't realize it. The Jews didn't
[2:22:48] realize it. The Sadducees, Pharisees
[2:22:50] didn't realize it. He was already paying
[2:22:54] redemptions full price.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; And he knew who for the joy that was set
[2:23:00] before him. He endured the cross. He
[2:23:03] endured the suffering because he kept
[2:23:05] looking towards the joy. He knew that
[2:23:08] this suffering was not only going to
[2:23:10] bring forth a people, but there would to
[2:23:12] be an appointed time, friends,
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; when he would come. He would send a
[2:23:16] messenger. I don't know what brother
[2:23:18] Brandham means to you. To me, he's the
[2:23:19] messenger that wedded me to Jesus
[2:23:22] Christ. He introduced me to Jesus
[2:23:25] Christ. He showed me who he was. He
[2:23:28] conducted the wedding ceremony and we
[2:23:31] are united already united with him.
[2:23:35] [Music]
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; And that is why he could come out of the
[2:23:40] grave. He came out of the seur.
[2:23:43] And that wasn't the end of the Passover.
[2:23:46] That wasn't the end of it now because it
[2:23:48] was being extended. They never had this
[2:23:49] in the Old Testament. And I'm closing
[2:23:51] now.
[2:23:53] That wasn't all of it. He now he dropped
[2:23:56] his blood on and bought you.
[2:24:01] But now there was another part to this
[2:24:04] and I closed with it last Sunday
[2:24:09] and that is there had to be a waving
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; of the sheath
[2:24:14] and he was the first one.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; Listen close. He was the first one.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; He was he was the son of God but he was
[2:24:22] the first one that acted like the son of
[2:24:24] God.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; He lived like the son of God.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; He had the character of the son of God.
[2:24:30] He was the son of God.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; He had a different kind of life in him.
[2:24:37] And the Holy Spirit moved over that
[2:24:40] still form and raised him up.
[2:24:43] And then he was seen by Mary. She didn't
[2:24:46] know. She thought he was a gardener
[2:24:49] till he called her name Mary.
[2:24:52] Then he walked with the two on the way
[2:24:54] to Emmas. They didn't know him till they
[2:24:56] got to his their place and invited him
[2:24:59] in. And he was constantly seeking to
[2:25:02] make himself known. Exactly what he's
[2:25:04] trying to do today.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Exactly this morning. You think, "Oh, I
[2:25:09] had a good time at camp or I mean I had
[2:25:10] this. I know this brother. I know the
[2:25:12] deacons, brother Ed, etc., etc. That's
[2:25:15] that's we're we're only ancillary. We're
[2:25:19] only
[2:25:21] things that are on the side. were only
[2:25:23] instruments through which he wants to
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; talk to you.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; And so now he made himself known to a
[2:25:32] few. Watch real close. And then he
[2:25:34] showed himself alive by many infallible
[2:25:37] proofs. It's me,
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Come Thomas.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; Put your finger in my hand.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Thrust your fist in my side. It's me.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Then they came to the shore.
[2:25:52] And there's no boat to get him there.
[2:25:55] And already there's fish and bread upon
[2:25:58] the fire.
[2:26:01] It's the Lord. It's the Lord. And it's
[2:26:03] it's like it's a dawning of a new day.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; And my dear friends, this message is not
[2:26:10] a mere doctrine. This is the dawning of
[2:26:12] a new day. So this same prophet would
[2:26:15] say in the end of his ministry, I say
[2:26:17] it's darkness, gross darkness on the
[2:26:19] people. But I say to you to the bride,
[2:26:21] shalom.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Good morning.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; It's a good morning to the bride.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; And he says, and then Jesus, they were
[2:26:35] standing there
[2:26:37] and he he began to ascend
[2:26:41] because he was the first sheath. He was
[2:26:43] the first fruits. He was the first one
[2:26:45] to come from the dead. And he was waved.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Not for us,
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; but he was waved to God.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; There was a waving as as as he
[2:26:55] physically began to ascend. And there
[2:26:59] was a waving cuz the sheath the wave she
[2:27:01] chief had to come to the priest
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; and the priest waved it. It was the
[2:27:05] first sheath that became ripe. He was
[2:27:07] the first one became ripe and it's waved
[2:27:10] over the people
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; and the and the prophet gave an
[2:27:13] interpretation. And he said it very
[2:27:15] clearly that there's more
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; like him.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; He said he believed it was waving it
[2:27:22] before the before God and he's saying,
[2:27:25] "Father,
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; there's more
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; like me
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; in the field.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; I bought them.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; I paid for them.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's more like me in the
[2:27:40] field that touched me so deep this
[2:27:42] morning." Amen.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh Lord Jesus,
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to start reading Matthew,
[2:27:49] Mark, Luke again.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; I want to be like you."
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; I want to think like you. I want to act
[2:27:56] like you. I've been a a miserable
[2:27:58] failure in this, but I want to be like
[2:28:00] you.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Because you already waved.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; And now here it is.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. And in the rising of the sun,
[2:28:12] God's messenger prophet says,
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; "Hallelujah."
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; And there would have to be another
[2:28:17] waving
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; again today.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And the word is being
[2:28:25] waved." People might say, "Well, it's a
[2:28:27] tape. It's a book. It's a MP3. It's a
[2:28:30] iPod. It's this and that." More than all
[2:28:33] of that,
[2:28:35] let it register into your soul. This is
[2:28:38] the word that's being waved over the
[2:28:40] people and the message remains the same.
[2:28:43] There's more like him and that they will
[2:28:47] come.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; You have come
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; as a result of that word.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; You are part of that promise.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to say to make you
[2:28:59] feel good. That's what the word of God
[2:29:01] declares.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; There'll be more like him
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; that'll rise up out of the field. Here
[2:29:07] we are, friends.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; Here we are.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; God's not going to raise up a whole
[2:29:15] another generation of people. You've
[2:29:17] heard it.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; You've heard it.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has witnessed to your
[2:29:24] soul.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; And that's why I say to you, I couldn't
[2:29:28] say anything more more honorable, I
[2:29:31] think, at this time. Give yourself
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; to him completely unreservedly
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; just to be what he wants you to be.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; Give yourself to him.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; He has waved this word. You think, "Oh,
[2:29:48] this is a this is brother Brandham and
[2:29:49] he brought a message." No, not only
[2:29:52] that. At the end of it, it is the rising
[2:29:54] of the sun.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; You know, it only just comes to me now.
[2:29:58] My wife and I were baptized at that
[2:30:00] service.
[2:30:02] It is the rising of the sun.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; I can tell you it was a new dawning for
[2:30:07] us.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; It was good morning.
[2:30:12] Shalom, Eden Ruth
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Biscll.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; It's a new day, folks.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; I say to you in the name of the Lord,
[2:30:20] it's a new day.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; What you feel moving and stirring in
[2:30:24] your heart, it's a new day.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; It's not just another week.
[2:30:30] There never was a week like that one
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; and there won't necessarily be another
[2:30:35] week like this one.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; What's the use of taking a chance?
[2:30:41] You don't want to look back and say,
[2:30:42] "Well, if I I'd only known." No,
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; you'll never be sorry. You'll never
[2:30:49] never be sorry for living snugged up and
[2:30:52] right where you ought to be every day,
[2:30:55] every week. Whether it's this week, it
[2:30:57] might be next week. If it's not next
[2:30:59] week, but what if it is this week?
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; What if it is this time?
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; I say in the name of the Lord, don't let
[2:31:11] it h ever have to come from your lips.
[2:31:15] Oh, I thought there was supposed to be a
[2:31:17] rapture.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; This prophet said also, there will be
[2:31:23] those
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. still here
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; saying that.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; Settle in your heart.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; I will never be here saying that.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; I will never be so caught up in this
[2:31:40] life that I have to say, I thought there
[2:31:42] was supposed to be a rapture.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; I say to the devil, you're a bluff.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; You're a liar. You have no part of these
[2:31:55] people. If you feel sluggish in your
[2:31:58] spirit, cast it out.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; Say, "Devil, you want to be that way.
[2:32:02] I'm not going to be that way. I'm giving
[2:32:04] myself entirely unreservedly."
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your time.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; You're not your own.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; You've been bought
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; with a price.
[2:32:24] I'd like to just sing. Have you stand
[2:32:26] with me, please?
[2:32:33] And I want to sing the chorus. Oh, to be
[2:32:35] like thee, brother Ryan. Oh, to be like
[2:32:37] thee, blessed redeemer, pure as thou
[2:32:40] art. Would you bow your heads with me?
[2:32:47] Father,
[2:32:49] a deep stirring is taking place.
[2:32:54] When we even think of those words,
[2:32:57] if we could only have brother Brandham
[2:32:59] here to say, he would say the same words
[2:33:01] once again,
[2:33:03] believing that the others would come.
[2:33:06] Believing that they would come,
[2:33:10] oh God, and I would like to respond,
[2:33:14] Father,
[2:33:15] you uttered your message through your
[2:33:17] messenger.
[2:33:19] And I want to say on behalf of those
[2:33:22] that are in this audience today and
[2:33:24] those that are in the streaming
[2:33:26] audience,
[2:33:28] we have come.
[2:33:30] Lord, we have heard the voice.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; We've heard the call. We've responded to
[2:33:35] the call. We're we we we are responding
[2:33:38] to duty. We are here, oh God, to be
[2:33:42] placed in action. We pray, oh father,
[2:33:44] you'll give us words that we might speak
[2:33:48] faithfully your words. We We are here to
[2:33:52] act, oh God. We are here to be, I pray,
[2:33:56] Father, to be what you would have us to
[2:33:57] be. Let us be what we need to be to be
[2:34:00] what to one another.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, let us be the kind of servants
[2:34:03] that the early church were. And when
[2:34:06] they gathered daily, they gathered
[2:34:08] regularly amongst w with one another.
[2:34:11] They broke bread together. They
[2:34:13] encouraged one another. Father, in the
[2:34:15] name of Jesus Christ, I pray that you'll
[2:34:18] give us a baptism, Lord Jesus, a baptism
[2:34:22] of of of sacrifice, Lord, that we might
[2:34:25] be like you. We see that this week that
[2:34:27] we're commemorating now, Lord, was a
[2:34:30] week that you would be undeterred. You
[2:34:33] would not be moved. You would go and set
[2:34:36] your face towards Calvary. You would be
[2:34:39] betrayed of Judas. You would go to the
[2:34:42] garden and there be betrayed and then
[2:34:44] you would go, oh God, and before the
[2:34:48] righteous ones who would condemn you and
[2:34:51] say all kinds of untruth about you. But
[2:34:54] you have set a goal and you had intent.
[2:34:58] You would purchase us. Jesus, thank you
[2:35:02] for buying me.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you for paying for me.
[2:35:08] There's no way I could lift myself up
[2:35:10] out of this muck and mire.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; But you delivered me. You bought me.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, for all those that are rejoicing
[2:35:18] together,
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; we want to be
[2:35:21] just like you.
[2:35:25] [Music]
[2:35:27] Oh,
[2:35:32] to be like,
[2:35:38] oh, to be like
[2:35:43] the
[2:35:45] blessed
[2:35:47] redeemer,
[2:35:52] pure as
[2:35:57] [Music]
[2:35:59] come in thy sweetness.
[2:36:06] Come in thy fullness.
[2:36:13] Stand thy own image
[2:36:16] [Music]
[2:36:19] deep on my heart.
[2:36:24] Once again, oh to be like
[2:36:31] thee.
[2:36:32] [Music]
[2:36:35] To be like
[2:36:38] thee.
[2:36:40] Blessed
[2:36:42] redeemer,
[2:36:44] [Music]
[2:36:47] you as
[2:36:54] come in thy sweetness.
[2:37:00] I thirst
[2:37:05] [Music]
[2:37:13] [Music]
[2:37:14] deep on my heart.
[2:37:19] I want to live
[2:37:23] the way
[2:37:26] he wants me to live.
[2:37:30] I want to give
[2:37:34] until there's just no more to give. I
[2:37:41] want to love
[2:37:45] till there's just no more love. Oh, I
[2:37:52] could never
[2:37:54] ever out love the Lord.
[2:37:59] [Music]
[2:38:01] He became me so I could become him.
[2:38:05] I believe brother Donnie Reagan brought
[2:38:07] this course.
[2:38:11] He
[2:38:13] became me
[2:38:16] so that I might become him by grace.
[2:38:27] He became me.
[2:38:31] So I might become
[2:38:37] my gra.
[2:38:42] He
[2:38:43] took my place
[2:38:46] so that I
[2:38:51] could take him.
[2:38:54] [Music]
[2:38:55] Oh, he became me
[2:39:01] so that I might become
[2:39:06] my
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; I'd like everyone to sing it as a
[2:39:10] prayer. If you would please just lift up
[2:39:14] your heart, open your heart, lift up
[2:39:16] your voice, and let these words express
[2:39:19] what is there.
[2:39:22] [Music]
[2:39:25] He became me. You did so that I might
[2:39:32] become
[2:39:35] my grace.
[2:39:39] [Music]
[2:39:41] He
[2:39:42] became me
[2:39:45] so that I might
[2:39:48] become him by grace.
[2:39:54] [Music]
[2:39:56] He
[2:39:58] took my place
[2:40:01] so that I
[2:40:03] through his lamb could take him.
[2:40:09] [Music]
[2:40:12] He became me
[2:40:16] so that I might become
[2:40:22] my gra.
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just ask this congregation
[2:40:28] as we're coming to a close.
[2:40:33] Are you sensing
[2:40:36] has God been doing something
[2:40:39] in your own heart? Maybe you don't quite
[2:40:41] fully understand, but there's been a
[2:40:44] drawing. There's been a supernatural
[2:40:47] something happening
[2:40:51] and you desire that that would not only
[2:40:53] continue, but it would intensify.
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:40:59] it's good to identify it. It's good to
[2:41:01] make a confession of it.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:41:05] here I am today.
[2:41:09] You spoke to me in other meetings. You
[2:41:12] spoke to me at camp.
[2:41:14] Do increase it, oh God. Increase it. I'm
[2:41:17] hungry. Blessed are they that hunger and
[2:41:20] thirst
[2:41:22] for they shall be filled.
[2:41:26] Father,
[2:41:28] my soul
[2:41:30] cries out, oh God.
[2:41:33] How long
[2:41:35] will it be until these bodies, oh God,
[2:41:40] pass from instruments and tools of time
[2:41:45] on into the eternal realm. And as your
[2:41:49] prophet has spoken, your servant has
[2:41:51] told us, it is just one breath away.
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; It is right here beside us. Theophony
[2:41:59] bodies are filling this auditorium.
[2:42:03] Oh God, right beside the believers, you
[2:42:06] would never let that word body go far
[2:42:09] from them. Oh father God, we do not
[2:42:14] understand the mechanics or the dynamics
[2:42:16] of it.
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; But we are praying, oh God, that you
[2:42:20] will quicken us,
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; quicken us to this hour,
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; quicken us to this meeting, for surely
[2:42:26] we will meet. Surely we will meet. Oh
[2:42:31] God, we will meet the dead in Christ.
[2:42:34] Hallelujah. We will meet the messenger.
[2:42:38] We will meet the Lord Jesus Christ. What
[2:42:41] an appointed time and what a feast that
[2:42:44] will be. Truly a marriage supper of the
[2:42:47] lamb. A meeting place, a meeting time.
[2:42:51] Oh God, I want to stand before this
[2:42:53] people and give you praise without any
[2:42:57] hesitation in my voice, without any
[2:43:00] restriction in my soul. We say Lord
[2:43:03] hosana, glory to God in the highest.
[2:43:07] Thank you, Father, for your eternal
[2:43:09] word. And as we move up, Lord, to this
[2:43:12] coming week, not even knowing if we'll
[2:43:15] be here for the next Sunday, but if not,
[2:43:17] what a celebration it will be on the
[2:43:20] other side when we are with the
[2:43:22] resurrected Christ and the resurrected
[2:43:25] ones. We live for that moment, Lord.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. In Jesus name.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Well, did I wear you out?
[2:43:42] All right. All right. There's going to
[2:43:44] be a meeting in the air and a sweet,
[2:43:46] sweet by and by. And then we're going to
[2:43:48] dismiss.
[2:43:53] [Music]
[2:43:59] There is going to be a meeting in the
[2:44:04] air. Heat. Heat.
[2:44:16] Heat.
[2:44:22] [Music]
[2:44:32] Heat.
[2:44:39] Yeah.
[2:44:42] Heat.
[2:45:00] Heat.
[2:45:02] Heat.
[2:45:09] [Music]
[2:45:12] Heat. Heat.
[2:45:14] [Applause]
[2:45:27] This side's going to be there. We got an
[2:45:29] appointment. Going to meet you over
[2:45:31] there. How about this portion here?
[2:45:34] We're going to meet you over there.
[2:45:36] Hallelujah. How about this section here?
[2:45:38] Going to meet you over there.
[2:45:40] Hallelujah. How about this side here?
[2:45:42] Amen. We're going to meet you over
[2:45:43] there. The balcony we're going to meet.
[2:45:45] God bless you. God bless you. God bless
[2:45:48] you. Hallelujah.
[2:45:50] Oh, what a meeting.
[2:45:55] [Music]
[2:45:57] Hallelujah.
[2:46:02] [Music]
[2:46:06] It's it's essential that we make this
[2:46:09] kind of confession.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; It's just as it's more powerful than
[2:46:13] telling the devil, "You want to smoke?
[2:46:15] I'm not going to do it. You go your way.
[2:46:17] I'll go my way." This is more powerful.
[2:46:20] Say, "I'm going to meet you, brother Ed.
[2:46:21] I'm going to meet you, brother, sister.
[2:46:23] Amen.
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Greet one another and
[2:46:27] we'll see you this evening. Going to
[2:46:29] hear the word of God. Brother Tom has
[2:46:31] been waiting before God for this service
[2:46:33] and we're going to hear him deliver his
[2:46:35] soul this evening. God bless you. You're
[2:46:37] dismissed in Jesus name. Amen.
