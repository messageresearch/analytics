I'm glad I'm here. &gt;&gt; I'm glad we're in the land of the living &gt;&gt; and able to say, "Savior, &gt;&gt; Savior, while on others, &gt;&gt; thou art calling. While on others, thou art calling, &gt;&gt; you'll not pass me by." Amen. We have guests and we always have wonderful things that are happening. And I spoke to a few folks at the dinner table tonight and said, "You're not having dinner at camp. That's not what's happening. You're actually sitting in the book of Acts." And I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; I believe it. And because I believe it, I experience it. We are sitting in the book of Acts. You're not just having a a service in a tent and a in a camp meeting. We are living out the prophet of God has said you will write a book of acts behind it. And I believe that there is a book of acts being written. And just uh we want to greet uh some folks here. Uh there's always things happening. There are there are some folks here that have flown up from Denver to Seattle and from Seattle drove right here and got here. &gt;&gt; Brother Murphy, would you like to invite them and then I would like to welcome someone? &gt;&gt; Sure. Well, we have a special guest. Uh they just arrived to Seattle from Denver uh this afternoon and then they rented a car and then drove all the way here and getting so excited to be in the service. Uh I wonder if brother Tony Wong and sister Le Young they can stand up. [applause] I just want to share a little testimony how they came into the Lord. Uh I'll see how fervent u if you want to find somebody that's a fervent and zeal and passionate for God, you need to talk to brother Wong and sister uh Lily and they are one of they just arrived. Um and sister Ruse asked me uh do they realize that in the last few days we have a heat wave here? I said, "I'm sorry. We haven't even got a time to talk about the weather yet." Which is &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; uh well, as soon as they arrived and we started to talk about the word, they started talking about how they sharing the message with uh the denominational church that they were in. The people they rejected him that he was sharing the message with them till almost 2:00 that in the morning and the constantly just sharing the serpent seed and the message and it come to a time the devil started attacking our brother. Then he got uh vertical and he started throw up. Then he uh get up again. He said that you know what the devil tried to stop me to share in the word with them but I'm going to share the word no matter what happens to me. And that's a ferveny that we were talking about and how they came to this message and sister Juniper I wonder if you can stand up Juniper. the sister juniper a few years ago and uh she uh received the message and uh after she received the message she's not sitting still this is all happened that around us and she started sharing a message with the people and then it caused a big stir in the church in Beijing that's uh in China that the former denominational church they went to and then uh after sister Juniper shared a message uh with them and then the head leaders of that um uh denominational church and asked Jim and uh uh Shirley, I wonder brother Jim and Sister Shirley, can you stand up? &gt;&gt; And they asked them to come over to pull sister Juniper out of the cult. Aren't you glad you're in the cult and somebody care about you? So then they send brother Jim and Sister Shirley come over to pull sister Juniper out of the cult. And so brother Jim and sister Shirley come into the service and with a full intention want to pull her out of it. And while they were sitting in the church and sister Juniper doesn't say a lot of things she just said come and see. And so they come to the church brother Jim sitting there sister Shirley sitting there and as the music started as the singing started and they started petting their feet and they start to raising their hands. They kind of enjoy the atmosphere and afterward that they asked, "Do you know that they're a cult?" He said that they're a cult or not. I don't know, but I sense a different supernatural atmosphere. I never sense it anywhere. &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, brother James is surely they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. [applause] &gt;&gt; And the story is not over. And then uh the burden came on brother Jim and sister Shirley and they uh invited brother Tony and sister Leoy then coming from China and they have the uh they have some uh task on their shoulder too because the leader said okay now we got a two already in the cult and you two go over there pull all of them out of the cult. So they coming over and sister Shirley and brother Jim's book a cruise they went to Alaska they're not talking about the weather. They're not talking about a cruise trip every morning. And this uh sister Shirley and the brother Jim just go to their door and knock on their door and said, "You want a Bible study?" And the whole week from the morning to night during the cruise and they're sharing the message with them and as soon as they're sharing about the serpent seed, brother Wong, brother Tony said that's exactly he said that's it. and all these uh church leaders the peoples that who consider to be spiritual and they never see it but for brother Tony the first time when brother Jim and sister shared that wisdom then he saw it &gt;&gt; and by God's grace a few months ago they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ [applause] [applause] so brother Ed we're talking about the book of act &gt;&gt; this is the book of act right in front of your eyes. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you and let us have a ferveny that passionate about what we heard. How the Lord has been preaching to us, how the Lord has been speaking the word to us. Now we saw that the word has uh been changing transformed this few people and they have a bird and a zeal in their heart. Every day brother Jim was sharing with his people that's in Beijing and sharing with them. They had a Bible study that in the Twasan there and they invited at a former denominational church members coming over and have a Bible study with them and sharing the word with them. But time after time people rejecting them don't believe what he said but God give them the burden in their heart. If I know something this is the truth I want to bring the truth to the people that whoever that encountered with. May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Murphy. God bless you. Thank you. [applause] And there's another sister here, not from China. She came originally from Russia. Bellarus, Russia. Sister Ena, wonder if you would stand up. Where's Sister Ena? Here. She is here. And her son. She brought her son, a 16-year-old son from Florida is standing there with her. And Sister Ena was standing in Russia when Sister Biscll and I were there in 1990. Now, many of you were not born at that time. Some of you were. And we communism had just fell, but the soldiers were still at the at guarding the doors of the hotel where the government assigned us to certain rooms and certain hotels. And we went there for one purpose and that is to see a elderly man my age or maybe older and he preached in communist Russia for 60 years. That is sister Ena's grandpa. And she was sitting in the church when I and my wife were there in 1990. and she remembers I don't remember my wife at the piano and sang a song and she remembers that listen friends and now she said I moved to Florida 5 years ago but I was in Moscow and you were there in Moscow we have been to Switzerland twice and she said and we heard about these meetings here this is not a meeting friends it's a book of acts Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Are you happy that you're in the book of &gt;&gt; the book of Acts? And then maybe in when you read the book of Acts, you think, "Oh, I wish I was there." You're here. &gt;&gt; You're in another book of Acts, you're in a book of Acts that are spoke of. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I do with all my heart. Sister Ena, thank you for standing. her grandfather saw brother Brandham in a vision before he ever ever met him. And and he was sitting at a table on at this side of the pullpit and I was standing at the pulpit. And I said, "Your pastor had a vision of the messenger of this age, and now I am here behind the pulpit to tell you that I was with him." And friends, they listened. And out of that group has come some believers. And here's sister Ena and her son here in this service. I can tell you friends, I am here to witness to you young people that this is a continuation of the book of Acts. This is and someday you will find that it's another chapter of the book of Acts. God bless you. &gt;&gt; And now we're here to hear the rest of it. [applause] Praise the Lord. Thank you, pastor. God bless you, brother Ed. &gt;&gt; I want to sing what a mighty God we serve. Eat.

Her [music] God is greater [singing] than the storm. Take her is Lord. [music] The [singing] battle is alone. [music] Hallelujah. I think we can praise him. [applause] [music] Hallelujah. We're expecting great things, &gt;&gt; young people. Are you expecting great things? &gt;&gt; As brother Biscll, [music] this is another chapter in the book of Acts. [music] And I I believe God's going to do exceedingly mo abundantly more than I could even ask or [music] think. And I want you to know this afternoon, we got alone with the Lord. And my expectancy is so high. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to let the devil have any room in this in this camp. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let any unbelieving spirit try and bind what God is going to do. I believe the Holy Spirit is here present to do more than you had even thought in your life. &gt;&gt; That we got young people that need a baptism of the Holy Ghost and a born again experience. And I'm believing God's going to use his servant &gt;&gt; in a mighty way. And if you don't want it, you give me your portion because I'm believing God is come down and is amongst us right now. &gt;&gt; Right now. And I sent that prophet and he stood there, brother Ron. He just stood there and he says, "You know what I'm waiting for? You know what I'm waiting for?" [music] He said, "I'm waiting for him." He said, "That same one that led the children of Israel is that same one that you've seen in that picture." [music] He said, "I'm waiting for him." And just that moment, in that time, he said, "I take every spirit under my control for the glory of God." That God, &gt;&gt; that God is in this tent right now. That God is going to use the man of God tonight. &gt;&gt; And I just say, Lord, would you have your way? We have the privilege to have Brother Ron Spencer. And Sister [music] Connie, where are you? Sister Connie Spencer, where are you? Way in the back. Way back there. God bless you, Sister Connie. Thank you for coming to join with us in these meetings. We love you and your family dearly. What, brother Ron? But the ministry and what he's meant to this church, we can't write it down. Supernatural. [music] And we have the privilege to have brother Andrew, his son, who's going to be speaking in the morning. And [music] sister Katie, his wife, is here. And we feel privileged to have you, too, brother Andrew. May God use you in a mighty way. How many want more of God tonight? &gt;&gt; Then you're going to get what you expect [music] &gt;&gt; because he's an unchanging God, brother Ram said, and he's unchanging in his [music] unexpected way. He said, if you want God to move, he always [music] moves in an unexpected time. So Lord, would you move at this time? We thank God for it. This is our our 33rd [music] family camp. 33 years ago. And God has kept [music] the vision that a pastor has had for us for 33 years. And as I say to the young people, is it worth it? Is it worth it? Is it worth it that when a man of God I got a pen down in my Bible in 1985 [music] said I give you your children and I was a deacon in the back of the church and I wrote that down in my Bible and said I accept that and I claim my children in the name of the Lord Jesus. 10 years ago my third son [music] got saved here at this camp. The year we bought this camp, God gave me my final son, my [music] last son. And I say he g if he did it for me, he will do it for you tonight. And I want you to come and start pulling for these young people that God gives them a Holy Ghost experience. We talk about an upper room. The upper room is right here in this tent right now. So, I feel very privileged and honored to introduce Brother Ron Spencer, [music] a man of God and a privileged friend of mine. May God use him and may you pull on the gift because you're going to get what you expect. So, God bless you, Brother Ron Spencer. God bless you. Thank you for accepting to be with [music] us at this camp. May God use you in a mighty way. Amen. Why don't you come in? Bless you. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? Amen. I have so many emotions standing here tonight. I I just hope that I can just share them without a whole lot of breaking down. But I'm so privileged to be here to enjoy this incredible celebration of 10 years of this camp. Maybe through through the service tonight I can share a few things, but I I'm honored to be here. Thank you for the invitation, Brother Tom and Brother Ed and the church. Thank you for having me here. This is almost like a reunion. And I see friends from all over. We certainly love you with all of our hearts. And uh we thank you for having us. and what incredible hospitality that you've given us. And I truly believe with all my heart that we have been called to a conference. And I believe that God's going to do incredible supernatural things. And how we already know is we've already seen already in this service what God is doing, &gt;&gt; not what a man is doing. Not what the influence of a man is doing, but what our God is doing among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Certainly thrilled to have Sister Connie with me. She was not able to be with me in Edmonton and we had wonderful meetings there and I see many Edmonton friends here tonight. And we love you. And God came on the scene for us there. And I believe he's the same God this week. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we could just talk to him for a moment. Heavenly Father, we love you with all of our hearts. &gt;&gt; Now, as we turn to the word, Father, we would ask you once again that you would come. Now, we realize that, Father, that no man, no man can do anything, but you're the one that comes and does the work. I ask you, Father, that you'd bless this place like never before. And if we could have any gift at all tonight, might it be both as speaker and as hearer to get ourselves out of the way? Now Lord Jesus, we have come with many needs tonight and we believe that you're a way maker and you provide a way of escape. Father, as I was coming to the pull pit this evening, I my thoughts begin to go back to last year and you gave me a sermon to speak in this pull pit. And that sermon was, "Satan, you can't take his life." Brother Ed, as he stood to this pull pit tonight, Father, I thank you for the power of a resurrection. &gt;&gt; I thank you for the power of life and your healing touch, &gt;&gt; a miracle that has happened among us. &gt;&gt; Dear God, we express our thanksgiving back to you and our hearts desire as a congregation, as a body of believers around the world. &gt;&gt; First of all, we stop and thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Thank you, dear God, &gt;&gt; that you brought doctors on the scene at the right time and &gt;&gt; the right kind of medicine. &gt;&gt; But Father, the high physician came on the scene and took the case. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we thank you for that, Father. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you. I'm just consumed with what you are doing &gt;&gt; and we even what you're preparing to do. Lord, we we thank you for laying your hands on this camp. &gt;&gt; We thank you for laying your hands on this camp. &gt;&gt; This is your work. &gt;&gt; This is your vision. &gt;&gt; This is your plan and this is your purpose. And you've got a purpose for your seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. now be may Satan's plans be thwarted tonight and may he be defeated in the name of Jesus Christ we pray we dedicate and commit these meetings to you father and give oursel to your your service &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen &gt;&gt; amen and amen bless you if you will turn with me to Isaiah chapter six. And I will [snorts] try my best not to hold you too long this evening, but I want to share some things that are just on my heart. Is that okay? I'd like to speak this evening on Mark this place. Mark this place. Not just a place in the scriptures, but mark this place where you're standing. Mark the place where you're sitting tonight. Mark this place. Remember this time cuz God chose to meet you here. &gt;&gt; Not because you've gathered just to be at another meeting. &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't even know who was speaking. Maybe you didn't even know kind of how the arrangements would be, but God rooted over you before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; and knew that you would be here. &gt;&gt; So, he's has something provided for you. &gt;&gt; He pre-planned this meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to share with you a couple of meetings that he has prepared this evening. in as we just turn our hearts toward him. Isaiah chapter 6 and verse one. Very important scriptures to the man that's going to be writing down and scribing the book of Isaiah. In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up. and his train filled the temple. And above it stood serapants. Each one had six wings. With twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and twain he did fly. One cried unto another and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory." And the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. Then said I, "Woe is me, for I am undone, because I'm a man of unclean lips, and dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts." Then flew one of the seraraphants unto me, having a live coal in his hand, and which he had taken from the tongs from off of the altar. And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. And also I I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?" And then said I, "Here am I. Send me." &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Isaiah chapter 118 and verse 23. The scripture said this is the Lord's doing. It is marvelous in our eyes. I pray that we can look beyond mortality even now human instrumentality beyond who's sitting beside of you and who's speaking and catch what God is doing here tonight the realm of time that we're standing the conditions of the world the prophecy that actually we are a part of the fulfilling even right Now verse 24 said, "This is the day which the Lord hath made." &gt;&gt; We will rejoice &gt;&gt; and be glad in it. &gt;&gt; Our prophet said that's what's happening today. He predestinated it to this by his fornowledge when he predestinated in Malachi 4 that it's going that it's got to happen. When he came over and predestinates anything to happen in his word, he had to prove his word to be so. And when he predestinates anything to happen and says that it will happen, he knows that that seed will be there just at that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He predestinated abroad. &gt;&gt; He predestinated a bride. &gt;&gt; He's talking about you. &gt;&gt; He predestinated a bride. &gt;&gt; She's going to be there. going to be a rapture. &gt;&gt; She's going to be there. &gt;&gt; He predestinates it by his fornowledge. &gt;&gt; See, there's nothing &gt;&gt; that's going to stop it. &gt;&gt; I love that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I want you to hear the prophet as he begins to speak. And just I'll just share this in my opening comments. Brother Brandham just shares his desire and shares his passion and shares where he's standing. He said, "I love him and I want you to love him. I want you to believe him." Perfect love casteth out all fear. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you love him with the right kind of a heart, you won't have one speck of fear, &gt;&gt; whether you can keep his word or not. &gt;&gt; I'd like to say booevil right there. &gt;&gt; It's not you keeping the word, but it's the seed that's on the inside of you. Night after night, standing on the platform before the gross thousands of people around the world, critics sitting there saying, "Is this that or another witch doctor standing there trying to throw spells on you, challenge you to dus and things like that?" Never one time. And I say by the grace of God has one speck of fear ever hit my heart. Not one time. &gt;&gt; Why? He said he would take care of me. &gt;&gt; He asked the question why he said he would take care of me. &gt;&gt; And I believe him. &gt;&gt; That's why if I would get scared, I'd run. Now, let me just say, God not only gave our prophet that promise, but what about you tonight? &gt;&gt; He said he would take care of you. &gt;&gt; Did God make that promise? &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, did God make the promise? &gt;&gt; Absolutely, he made the promise. And he's an infinite God, and God's never failed. &gt;&gt; He's never lied. He's never been in a crisis. &gt;&gt; He predestinates it to happen. And it's got to be that way. &gt;&gt; And all of hell can't stop it. &gt;&gt; All of hell can't stop it. &gt;&gt; The greatest imps, the greatest demons of hell cannot stop the power of what God [screaming] is doing even in this moment. But I tell you, when Jesus Christ anoints you, you're not made out of running material. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; Not the Rock of Gibraltar, but the Rock of Ages. &gt;&gt; You climb up in the rock of ages. That's God's word. and take your position there and stand when the gates of hell is battling against it with this perfect assurance &gt;&gt; that he who promised it &gt;&gt; will not fail. It'll never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's faith. &gt;&gt; And that's when you're not scared. The devil's nothing but a bluff anyhow. snorting and blowing and all the thunder and the and no lightning. But I tell you, brother, that the lightning power of the resurrected Jesus Christ puts a reality there that shocks the soul from a dead slumber of these earthly bound things into the immortal realms to believe God and to take him at his word and call those things which are not as though they [screaming] were. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I just get a little bit excited. And that's the way it is. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 1 and verse 5. Before I formed thee, &gt;&gt; in the belly, &gt;&gt; I knew thee, &gt;&gt; and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee. &gt;&gt; And I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. &gt;&gt; Now listen as a prophet says this. And he said, "Now God's strategy is to take empty human vessels &gt;&gt; and shake the world with them. Like at Pentecost. At Pentecost, what did he do? He taken them 10 days and to get them all emptied out. He said, "But they was all standing there with their vessels turned up. And God took himself and filled them up. That's all. And they shook the world with it." &gt;&gt; That's the need of today. That's what we need today is empty vessels &gt;&gt; so God can fill them up. Who's he talking to tonight? &gt;&gt; Me and you. &gt;&gt; Who's the challenge to tonight? We're not waiting for somebody else to come. This is our hour. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ronnie, wish somebody else was in the building. God chose you. &gt;&gt; And God ordained you. &gt;&gt; He watched over your path getting here. He watched over your mother and father's path and your grandfathers and your great-grandfathers and the generations all the way back and pre-planned it. He was determined to take care of the natural seed, knowing that you would get here, knowing your hair color, knowing what your eyes would look like, even your human nature. God knew that he was going to call you in this day to hear this predestinated word &gt;&gt; and you would meet the challenge of [screaming] this day. &gt;&gt; You are that thousands of lived voices. &gt;&gt; A prophet would speak a few sermons on influence. He would understand influence. He had dealt with a lot of influences. Influential men around him. Influential men that had a a lot of opinions. Influential men that wanted to push him this way or that way. Some of them wanted to him to quit preaching on how women ought to dress. Maybe if he could just if he could just uh maybe just back off and teach them gifts &gt;&gt; because the message had a great attraction to it, &gt;&gt; but they wanted to polish it up. &gt;&gt; These were men of schools. These are men of great organization. They knew that this had life in it, but they couldn't take the word test. &gt;&gt; So, he knew what influence was. So when he would walk to the pullpit and speak a sermons like the influence of another or influence, he was not just speaking it because it was a good topic &gt;&gt; because he understood what the influence of even denomination or organization or leotaa was putting on the church. And he like Isaiah &gt;&gt; could not get his eyes on the kings of this world &gt;&gt; or the great men of this world &gt;&gt; because he had had a meeting. &gt;&gt; He had had a conference &gt;&gt; in another realm. &gt;&gt; That's our challenge today. To meet a living God. to meet the God of this message. &gt;&gt; Isaiah was an important man of the scripture. He will write a commentary. He will write a prophetic book. In the Old Testament, he will very be a very key man. But being a key man, he had grew up under the influence of a king. This king had a a very good background. and he had a very good heritage. But this king got lifted up and got his eyes on a position that was not his &gt;&gt; and he began to allow things to happen. God could not allow him to continue in the in the position that he was in. &gt;&gt; But you see, God had a plan. And maybe you have got your eyes on different things of this world, different different aspects of this world and different influences of this world that may has draw you in different directions. But maybe tonight if we could just stop for a few minutes and look into another realm, &gt;&gt; God would like to pull our eyes off of the things of the world &gt;&gt; and put us in a direction and a direct channel where he can speak to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. More than the effects of a camp, &gt;&gt; more than some temporary weak or two sensationalism about it, &gt;&gt; more than some emotion, but [laughter] an anchor &gt;&gt; that will anchor your soul for the rest of your lives &gt;&gt; more than some sensationalism. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? something that will anchor you. &gt;&gt; Let me just say sometimes we've got to come like Jacob did. Jacob had the birthight now in his hands. Jacob was blessed. He could see the blessing around him. Everything he touched seemed to be blessed. But he was making his way back to his homeland. And he knew, I just can't even live with myself. You know, sometimes we've got to come to that spot in our life. &gt;&gt; May I speak it not just to the seen audience, but maybe even the unseen. There's decisions that have been made, actions that have been done that has caused incredible hurt and pain, choices that have been made. As our prophet says, choices will will take us somewhere. &gt;&gt; Choices will send you down a path. &gt;&gt; Decisions have consequences to them. &gt;&gt; They will not just affect you. &gt;&gt; As a young person, they'll affect your your family. &gt;&gt; They'll affect your future family. That's right. &gt;&gt; They'll affect generations. &gt;&gt; And Satan would tell you that it's just a that you you've got to make your own decisions. And you and and and he begin to show you opportunities. And you see, he showed Jesus opportunities. &gt;&gt; He showed lot opportunities. He'll show you opportunities and sometimes you can't see because of your human ability. You can't see past tomorrow of where this decision is going to take us. &gt;&gt; Satan will talk a man into smoking one cigarette. &gt;&gt; And brother Mannon said he don't have to tell him no more to do it. listening to one piece of rock music. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Or one wrong thing on an internet and before long it becomes a rolling vortex. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And after a while, guilt begins to set in and condemnation and traps and chains of circumstances begin to be wound around you. &gt;&gt; Before long, like like Jacob, he's deceived his brother. He's deceived his father-in-law. His family knows that he's living a lie. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that will fix that, and that's God. &gt;&gt; That's God. That's the only thing that will fix it. &gt;&gt; It's God to come on the scene in your life. He didn't know where the the meeting was going to be at, but he got himself alone. You know, God be to move to force him to get himself alone. He thought he was making the choices, but God had a plan to get him alone. He got Isaiah alone. Sometimes [snorts] he has to get you alone. &gt;&gt; And he pulls you a place alone to where that he can deal personally with you. &gt;&gt; And he gets you to a place to where it's just you and him. a place to where that he can supernaturally speak to your life. &gt;&gt; Jacob didn't know what kind of a place that he was at until he came. We can read the scriptures that that an angel came and he wrestled with that angel. Could we say this tonight that Jacob wrestled with him because he refused to stay the way that he was? &gt;&gt; Jacob knew Jacob. &gt;&gt; You know you. It's not your mom and dad or your grandma and your granddad or pastor. It's you and God. &gt;&gt; This is an individual relationship. Brother Ron, but I've came to camps before and I've walked to altars before, but you know where you are today. Now, I don't want to just talk to the front row. I want to go all the way to back row. &gt;&gt; We know where we're at. &gt;&gt; We know oursel. We see our condition. And now God has brought us to a place to where we can have a personal meeting. If we're not careful, we'll wrestle with our own self-will. &gt;&gt; Our own self-will will wrestle with that. But if we could only grab a hold tonight and say, "God, don't leave me like I am. &gt;&gt; Don't leave me like I am. I've got to have a change. &gt;&gt; Now, what put that desire on the inside of us? &gt;&gt; Because we couldn't seek for God. God came seeking for us. &gt;&gt; And so, under the atmosphere of that presence, something comes to life. &gt;&gt; We couldn't bring it to life, but that something comes to life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our prophet would call it gene seed, &gt;&gt; God DNA. &gt;&gt; It would be on the inside of us &gt;&gt; and it would begin to come to life. This is more than about a church society going to a church. God wants to have a personal relationship with you. And Jacob begins to hold on. &gt;&gt; I think about when brother Brandham prays for that little girl in Jonesboro, Arkansas. When she recognizes that it's brother Brandham &gt;&gt; that is standing in front of her. &gt;&gt; Exactly. when she recognizes that brother Brandamus is there and he has to explain to her I'm not the healer. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But all she knew was she had to get to him. &gt;&gt; And she's told brother Brandham if if I can get to William Brandham I can get to my daddy. &gt;&gt; And she's recognized I've come to this meeting and I don't want to go home blind. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; She was living in a condition and refused to go home blind. &gt;&gt; She refused. If I can get to this man where where Jesus is operating in. If I can get to him, &gt;&gt; I won't have to feel around in the night. I'll be able to see what color dress I've got on. I'll be able to see everything that around me. I'll see the sun come up in the morning. I'll see the stars at night. &gt;&gt; If I can get to him, I'll find my daddy. &gt;&gt; When she recognized who he was, she grabbed the lapels of his coat. &gt;&gt; She held on. She held on. I'm sure that made him feel uncomfortable. As a man of God, I'm sure that made him feel uncomfortable. Now she's got a hold of him. But she refuses to let loose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would ask you tonight, could you kind of get a little bit even out of your own human order and grab a hol and hang on? If I could ask you tonight, &gt;&gt; you're tired of just sitting in a pew and going through the the run of the emotions. And that's for somebody else. And I'm tried. I've made promises. I've made vows. I've I I've did all different kinds of things. But but God has called a conference tonight. It is God that has called this conference. And I don't want to miss this. How many time did the brother brother Brandham tell us, don't miss this. &gt;&gt; Don't miss this. Oh, but I wasn't in his meeting. But this is a book of Acts for you. &gt;&gt; I want to I want to just call to you. Don't miss this. &gt;&gt; To miss this. How many have we saw set in places like you're sitting at? &gt;&gt; And just take it for another service. &gt;&gt; Where are their lives at today? &gt;&gt; Where did their choices take them? I'm sorry to go negative for a moment, but where did their choices take them? &gt;&gt; I would tell you tonight, there's no life out there. &gt;&gt; There's no life out there. Where's their denominations taking them? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Where? Where is their pulpits leading them? &gt;&gt; Why one word out of place is separation from God? &gt;&gt; Just one word. &gt;&gt; To walk away from the message of the hour separates you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And I'd say if I was in that condition, I would call, I would dig, I would scream. I'd eat every bit of pride that I could to scream my way back to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She held on. &gt;&gt; We have a testimony because she held on. Her eyes came open because she held on. &gt;&gt; Jacob held on to the angel. &gt;&gt; Jacob wrestled [screaming] with him. &gt;&gt; And Jacob wrestled with him until the sun was beginning to come up. &gt;&gt; And he wrestled with him and he held on. &gt;&gt; He refused to go home. Jacob, &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; God put this on my heart, so I'm just delivering it to you with with all my heart. &gt;&gt; I was at a place in my life one time that I refused. &gt;&gt; I refused. &gt;&gt; I didn't want to live that way no more. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and something on the inside of me was calling to a higher walk. I remember that place. &gt;&gt; I remember that time. I remember that moment &gt;&gt; where I met the voice behind the voice. I walked into the tent yesterday with brother Tom and I saw the painting that is behind me and I was filled with emotion. Because that painting has become a part of my life. It has been interweaved with the fabric of my being. Switzerland. Brother David Mayor is here and I I can't find him just now. It's hard to hard to believe I can't find a man that tall. And I'd meet friends like brother David and brother Daniel and I I Brother Gito's daughter's in the building. Sister Jessica's son is here. God bless you. Brother Biscll would call me and he would share his burden for the people of Switzerland and all the countries around. He's quite a salesman. Has incredible passion. But you see, he delivered the message, but God wouldn't allow it to just be passed over. I couldn't go that first year. But brother David, when I went with Brother Biscll and Brother Tom and the other ministers that were there, something gripped my heart. And this place, this place became a conference and we would witness through the last years. People come from all over and they would be like Isaiah and be like Jacob &gt;&gt; and they would rrestle it out. Brother David, you send out announcements and you you guys do a phenomenal job of setting that meeting up. And I'd say it's beyond human effort that does it. You send an invitation out. Come. You don't know who's coming, what walks of life that they're coming. And they come. They come to the meeting. And in that meeting, he gathers. You see, no man can gather the seed of God. It's God that sends forth his word. &gt;&gt; He sends forth his word and he begins to he begins to anoint anoint men to come and stand in the pullpit and speak the words of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not with agenda of mankind but an agenda of the word of God &gt;&gt; that this message would be exalted. The Christ of this message would be exalted and it would find its bedding grounds. &gt;&gt; And we can mark that place. &gt;&gt; We can mark that spot. We've seen it over and over. Brother Random said God calls a conference. &gt;&gt; He said men call a conference. He said they'll call the Geneva conference and they'll call other conferences and they'll get together and they'll fuss with one another and they'll come to some sort of a decision. But God calls a conference. &gt;&gt; It makes a major difference when God calls the conference. &gt;&gt; He is determined to get his seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many of this is the first time here tonight? First time you've ever been to this camp. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now, this is not choreographed or neither did I run this by Brother Biscell or Brother Tom or any of the men that's working. You look around, this is more than just a nice place. This took vision. This took immense amount of money. This took a the amount of effort of an army almost of volunteers. Now a decade. Sometimes we walk up to a painting and we don't know what what that painting actually cost. You go, "Oh, that's nice." And we don't know it took a lifetime of a honing a gift to make that painting. I'll speak maybe later in the week. Sister Marilyn's an incredible artist, but it's a life's work. This camp and these young men that's working sitting all in the back and working all over the building. They were once sitting in seats like you are. &gt;&gt; When we hear Isaiah say, not only did God speak to him, but then he responded back to God. Here am I send me. &gt;&gt; It's not just answering to a voice and believing a voice, but there's work to do. There's incredible work [screaming] to do. And &gt;&gt; God wants you. He wants your hands. &gt;&gt; He wants your energies. &gt;&gt; He wants your life. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; God wants to use you. When I look around at this this camp, it holds incredible memories for me. Can I just share a few things here? Very personal. This is the 10th anniversary of this camp of Bayern Mount Baker camp and it becoming what it is. This is more than brother Biscll's vision. &gt;&gt; This is God's vision. &gt;&gt; This is God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we go, I want to see a miracle. &gt;&gt; You're sitting on one. &gt;&gt; You're sitting on one. &gt;&gt; God provided this. &gt;&gt; Oh, Brother, I want to see something God's done. Look around. Just look around. &gt;&gt; I don't know of all how the workings that this camp came about, but I'd like to take you to one of the first phases of my I'd been to other camps. I'd never been to this one. Where I first would get acquainted with the first year of this camp was was when I was in a coma and I was laying burned 75% of my lungs burned. I had pneumonia on the very day, not two weeks later, not a month later, not six weeks later, did we figure out some things and put some things together to make it look right, but on the very day that the doctors would say there was no hope and no way and no chance and there's no way On that very day, God speaks to your pastor. &gt;&gt; God speaks to your pastor. &gt;&gt; That brother Ron will be the speaker next year. &gt;&gt; I want you to just think just for a moment of the impossible human thinking. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Think of the impossible. Sometimes we think, well, man puts this all together. I want to just stop and let's just consider the miracles. &gt;&gt; Let's just consider the miracles first of all that this ground has provided. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of all the places in British Columbia, Colombia and and Washington, this piece of ground &gt;&gt; is provided &gt;&gt; in one of the most beautiful areas in all of Washington. God provides this. I would say that Satan giggled. &gt;&gt; The morning that brother Biscoll called sister Connie and my oldest son that had pulled me out of the fire was in one hospital and I was in another hospital. Not just in a hospital, but in a burn unit on life support with zero chance of living. Doctors, nurses here, you know what? 75% of your lungs, not just your lungs, but your throat, your mouth, all of the inner workings of your mouth, your lips, your face, your arms, your body is burned. Just when it looks impossible to man &gt;&gt; in that state, God anoints a servant of the Lord. Well, brother Ron, I'd like to see vindication. If not just this miracle, &gt;&gt; God speaks to your pastor. He will be the speaker next year. Brother Matt, that's beyond human thought, human. &gt;&gt; I would lay for another couple of weeks. [laughter] I wouldn't know anything about the plans of God. &gt;&gt; I would come into a condition where that I would be 36 hours literally nonresponsive. And if God doesn't work a miracle in five more hours, they're going to take my organs. Brother Tim Puit stands in my home church and he preaches two sermons. God's Hall of Fame. Some way by faith, brother Jimbo, he's he puts me in God's Hall of Fame. And on the day that I went nonresponsive where that the doctors couldn't figure out what went wrong, he stands in the pull pit in my pullpit at home and preaches God will have a testimony. And the next morning I woke up. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; God had a plan. &gt;&gt; God had a plan. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll chose since all of this had happened in our lives, chose to bring our family Brother Andrew, Sister Katie, Brother Matthew, and Sister Cassie, and you chose to bring my father and my mother. And they came and they came to that meeting. And my father told me just last week, he said, "I'll tell you." And he said, "You can tell Brother Biscll this." And so I'm doing this very public now. He said, "That was the greatest vacation I've ever had in my entire life when I got to come to that camp meeting. You can go all over the world and do all kind of worldly things and but let me just say this to you. To come to a spot like this &gt;&gt; where you meet God, &gt;&gt; there's just nothing greater. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about the value of a seed. &gt;&gt; It's worth 10 million worlds. &gt;&gt; 10 million worlds. Now think about that. God in his infant mind called you before the foundation of the world. Then he chose the place to meet you at. Brother Joel Ray. Brother Joel Ray, would you just stand? Sister Joanne. Sister Joanne, where's she at? She had a burden on her heart for her third son. She had expressed her burden to her father. She wanted life for her son. Let me explain to you. We're not satisfied with just living a good worldly life. We want &gt;&gt; eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We want Christ [screaming] &gt;&gt; with everything that is within us. Brother Tom, &gt;&gt; we won't negotiate for something second class. &gt;&gt; We want God. We've got a covenant with God. &gt;&gt; We've got a covenant with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; This covenant is with God and he's and he's bound [screaming] to his own word. &gt;&gt; And we gave Joel to God when he was born &gt;&gt; and she was not willing for Satan to destroy his life &gt;&gt; in that meeting. God came on the scene &gt;&gt; being rich in mercy &gt;&gt; and grabbed a hold. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; More than emotion, &gt;&gt; more than some sensationalism. &gt;&gt; But God grabbed a hold of his life. You see, he's determined. &gt;&gt; He's determined to get his seed. He'll bankrupt heaven to get to where you're at. &gt;&gt; He went to the woman at the well. He knows where she was. &gt;&gt; He [screaming] knows how to come and get a hold of your life. He's not ashamed tonight to come and get a hold of you. &gt;&gt; That night changed Joel Ray's life. How long did it take? Just a moment. Just a moment. Just a moment. And you're just not no more the same, Brother Joel. Now, this is all right, Sister Joanne. I'm sorry to keep you standing. Brother Joel, that that didn't just affect you. Where's your father-in-law? Could you stand? Where's your mother-in-law? Could you stand? Is your wife in the building? No, she's working. Your baby Good for them. And we thank the Lord Jesus for his miracle of peace, brother Joel. We could say tonight that you see God put it on your heart, Sister Joanne, because you'd made a covenant many years ago. And we heard brother Tom Ray speak earlier about writing it down on the fly leaf of his Bible. Just writing it down. Brother Biscllow, you spoke those words and you spoke eternal words. Those were eternal words. And when you spoke those words, those words had power, Brother Glenn. It would affect your life. It would affect your life in a traumatic way, an incredible way, a very creative way, because you wanted a a Joel that had a new birth. Yes, sir. You wanted a Joel that was serving God. &gt;&gt; You wanted a Joel that would dedicate his life and his job and his gift to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I would say one night, &gt;&gt; now let me just say all of his life was pressing toward that night. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every service that he was in was pressing toward that night. And that night, he recognized &gt;&gt; the voice behind the voice that had came on the scene to bring a gathering for him. &gt;&gt; And it changed their lives. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a great big hand. [applause] 10 years. [applause] Michael Andes, where you at? Stand on a chair. End that meeting. He would get called out and we would be amused at it. Maybe we could show that one evening. He'd people would be amused at myself bringing Brother Michael up. He's a little bitty boy. And I would begin to talk about this is what Satan hates. God can take this little bitty guy and shake the world with it. &gt;&gt; How important is this camp? &gt;&gt; How important is this camp, Silas? &gt;&gt; How important is it? &gt;&gt; I'll tell you it was very important for you. No doubt in another round they were chuckling, but God knew what he was doing. &gt;&gt; He knew what he was doing. And he was anchoring something in your life. &gt;&gt; And he began to talk about dynamite coming in small packages. I'll tell you, when it does, [screaming] &gt;&gt; it's life. &gt;&gt; Eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that life begins to speak to other seeds and scream out. &gt;&gt; Who did it affect? We could we could have his whole family to stand tonight and say it has affected us all. We could have the whole church to stand tonight and say it has affected us all. &gt;&gt; Brother John, it's affected your life. &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, it's been made a team player. It's affected your business. It's affected your your education. It's affected everything in your life. &gt;&gt; So, we watched him preach the other day and using a a bullhorn. Boy, sometimes I'd like to have one of them. And he set a pan on fire. Nobody' ever let me do that. But what was he doing? Expressing life. &gt;&gt; This is more than just a coalition of quotes. &gt;&gt; This is more than just a good recipe. &gt;&gt; This is life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I brought my family. I spoke this meeting in a weakened condition. But I brought my family and she would sit. Sister Katie and brother Andrew would sit in that tent about where you are, Sister Lelay, Brother John. And they would sit back there. And Andrew was a good boy. He believed the message, but he didn't have a life. Did you catch what I just said right there? He was a good boy. He believed the message, but he didn't have a life. I knew that. I understood that. But brother Tom, I had a covenant. Sister Joanne, I understood what you and I was screaming to God, God help my children. [snorts] You'll hear brother Andrew speak in the morning. He's more than just a reproduction of myself. God knows you wouldn't want to copy me to start off with, but Sister Katie sat about where you are and during the meeting, she would just scream. 10 years later, she screamed only one other time in a meeting like that. And it was just a few weeks ago and I heard her just blowing in the presence of God. She was just screaming with all of her might &gt;&gt; and I thought I heard that scream a few years ago &gt;&gt; and she was sitting in that meeting and she was just screaming out to God in the presence of the Lord. That week, Brother Andrew would be standing in the street with Brother Tom Ray and he would turn in desperation. He needed to know the God of this message. &gt;&gt; He needed to know the voice. And [screaming] in that moment, &gt;&gt; somehow I tell him, "We've got a covenant." Somehow he grabbed a hold of the covenant &gt;&gt; and he held on. &gt;&gt; One Andrew walked up to brother Tom. Another Andrew walked away. &gt;&gt; Who did it affect? His family. his [screaming] wife, his children, his parents, our church. &gt;&gt; Thousands have heard him preach. Now, I tell you, one seed, &gt;&gt; that's the seventh seal. One seed coming to life is like a rocket going off. &gt;&gt; Your life affects &gt;&gt; many others. To God be the glory. &gt;&gt; No more conference sessions. No more no more trying to listen. It was just settled. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'm struggling with this and struggling with that and I'm struggling with this and I'm struggling with that. You get into his presence one time. It'll settle that. &gt;&gt; It'll just settle that. You won't have to worry about the music no more, &gt;&gt; the video games anymore, &gt;&gt; the all the kind of nonsense anymore. It'll just evaporate &gt;&gt; in a moment's notice. It'll evaporate out of your life. &gt;&gt; It'll be more than just a service. It'll be more than just coming and and setting and a movement of it. All of a sudden, you'll be pulling on the life. &gt;&gt; Can I give you one more story? I was in China with brother Murphy Wong and brother Tom Ray, brother Glenn Gruner. And we had we had meetings that we will that will you'll never reduplicate them, remanufacture them. It was just sovereign meetings. We witness phenomenal incredible book of acts among us. I come to the end of my my journey and as it would be brother Jason would be flying home at the same time. And so we go we go through the ticket situation at the same time. His mother and father's with him and brother Tom's with me and brother Murphy with Glenn. They're staying behind and and I'm going through and I'm a very anxious traveler. I I I'm not I come off of a farm. I I flying is just not in my my deal. And so here I am with this 20 year old boy. You 20 yet? Yeah. And he's with me. And he doesn't realize how precious he is to me right now. He's he's crutching my nervousness. And we go through customs together. and we go we go into the gate area together and I want to I don't know I've ate a lot of things in China and I'd like something that's familiar to me and I got a whopper. [snorts] I felt like I got cheated cuz it was about that big. And we walked out to the area. He I I think you just got a drink maybe. And walked out to the area and we sat down and we sat there and we didn't talk about the weather. There was people sitting all around us. You know, it's a busy airport. They're sitting all around. And there's a man man sitting as close to me to brother Tom right behind brother Jason and I asked him I said tell me your story and he began to talk about coming and and actually finding they brought him to this school because of this school and he began to talk about coming to the school and living in the home and talking about trying to dress and do right and behave himself. And &gt;&gt; he begin to come to church and and one day &gt;&gt; one day it came to life &gt;&gt; and one day something be to respond to him and this message became a reality to him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is it okay if I just share these words? &gt;&gt; And brother Jason was standing there and he said, I begin to think about the other guys around me. He said, I'm getting it now. Why aren't you getting it? &gt;&gt; And he be to he be to share these words. He says, "It become alive to me." And I thought everybody else ought to receive the same experience that I received. And he began to talk about how school became, how church became, and how the message became and and how that he wanted to do something. Now &gt;&gt; I started, now I'm ending with this. God speaks to him and he believes it and then he responds, "Here am I. Send me." Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was sitting on this side of him and there's a man sitting on the other side and tears are running down his face and you don't know it till this very moment that you was affecting somebody even in the airport that you didn't even know. &gt;&gt; Brother Jason, will you stand? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To God &gt;&gt; be the glory. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. How many people will he affect? Only eternity. &gt;&gt; How many will you affect? What about your home? &gt;&gt; What about what you left? &gt;&gt; You're from France. God sent you as a representative from France. You're from Belgium. &gt;&gt; He sent you as a representative from Belgium. &gt;&gt; We've got many countries represented sitting in this building. We've even got Louisiana sitting in this building. We've got Edmonton sitting in this building. &gt;&gt; God knows exactly where you're from. &gt;&gt; And he gathered you from all ends of the earth for this place. &gt;&gt; From Grand Prairie. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Even being a minister, brother Steven. But I believe God can ignite you like never before. &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Honor had an experience but many refillings of the spirit of God. May the revival fires be like never before, &gt;&gt; more than emotion, &gt;&gt; more than a sensation, [cheering] &gt;&gt; but may God speak to our hearts. &gt;&gt; That moment. In that moment, Brother Calvin, a few years ago, you and I had a moment. And you know, and we don't have to say no more. We had a moment, changed your life. How long does it take? Tell you how long it took for me. Seconds. Seconds. Just seconds. Seconds. It changes our life forever. Absolutely forever. Isaiah, Jacob, Ruth, Abraham, William Brandham in a cave. He shares his life with us and then begins to tell us that he'll come to you. He'll come to where you are. He chose this place. Mark this place. Mark this night. Mark it. You got counselors to support you. &gt;&gt; You got ministry to support you. But this is more than a social gathering. &gt;&gt; Many of you have peer pressure that you're struggling with. Many of you got pressures that you don't even want to tell your mother and father about. You close the world in. And sometimes it's like a cage. It's like a trap. It's like a chains. Weaknesses that you struggle with in your mind. And there's things that you struggle with that only you know about. &gt;&gt; Could it be tonight that you could say, "I don't want to stay this way. I don't want to stay this way, brother. Do I have to live the rest of my life [snorts] &gt;&gt; in just a churchgoing condition and &gt;&gt; just a condition of just hiding things from others. &gt;&gt; My choices are taking me down wrong roads. I'm telling you, in just a moment tonight, &gt;&gt; in just a moment, &gt;&gt; oh, brother Ron, I think I'll make a decision. God's already began your decision process &gt;&gt; way before you ever packed your clothes. [applause and cheering] He's gathering his seed. He's got eternal purposes here. &gt;&gt; More than counting chairs and more than counting people. He's after you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need a man to tell you who you are. You know, &gt;&gt; you don't need a man to tell you your weaknesses. You already know. &gt;&gt; And the key is God already knows. &gt;&gt; Could we bow our head just a moment? &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; We talk about chains. We talk about prison walls. We talk about darkness of choices. We talk about just being lonely, going through the motions. Maybe you'd like to say, "I just need a touch from God. Brother Ron, I just need to give my life to him like never before. I'd like to raise my hand to him. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Brother, I'm just exhausted putting up with myself. I want to just give myself away to him tonight. I just want to just give myself to him. I I I I I don't want to wait till another meeting. I I I I just I'm just exhausted with with the things in my life. I just got to have a I got to have a change. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to just invite you to this altar now. You've raised your hands. One seed, the value, who will it affect, Jessica? Who will it affect? Who will it affect? Oh God. Oh God. Hallelujah. Let's talk to him now. &gt;&gt; I want you to talk to him with your lips and your heart. &gt;&gt; Maybe you've done this before, but tonight, &gt;&gt; may it be different than ever before. Won't you just lay it all out just tonight? &gt;&gt; Lay it out just now. &gt;&gt; Lay it out just where you're at just now. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I invite you to where I'm at now. &gt;&gt; Eternal God, I bow my head before you now. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, you've came wave after wave already in this meeting. &gt;&gt; It's been like a mighty wave as you you've moved even in this service now. &gt;&gt; These are your children, Satan. You can't have them. We make a claim tonight. In the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the name of Jesus Christ, we rebuke every demon of hell, every tormenting enemy, &gt;&gt; Satan tries to destroy our lives, but we're here to destroy his purpose tonight. We rebuke the enemy. &gt;&gt; We rebuke the shadows of darkness right now &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. May every chain be loose right now. May there be a sounding of jubilee happen among us. We're not a slave to that thing any longer. Oh dear God, we renounce those things in the name of Jesus Christ and we give our life to you, Father. We give oursel to you, Lord God. Now we ask you that you'd fill every fiber of our being. &gt;&gt; May you sanctify our lives and cleanse us, Father, by the blood of Jesus Christ. May that blood wash us. Wash the desires, wash the affections, wash our memory, wash our thought process, wash our mind, wash our hearts. May the blood of Jesus Christ begin to create in us a new heart, a new life. Oh God, may it change our ambition, change our purpose. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh God, God. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; we look and live tonight. &gt;&gt; And we call to the house of hell. Give way in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Satan, you're defeated. You're defeated. You're nothing but a bluff. &gt;&gt; Amen. in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Lord, may the search light of the word of God go through our hearts right now. &gt;&gt; On this first night, it's been you that's pulled to us. We stand like Isaiah and in the presence of God, &gt;&gt; this holy presence tonight, &gt;&gt; we recognize our humanity. &gt;&gt; Yes, God. May you take the tongue, the call from off of the altar, lay it on our lips, &gt;&gt; and we respond. Here am I, Lord. &gt;&gt; I mark this place tonight. &gt;&gt; I mark this place. This is more than a tent. It's more than a camp. This is a conference with God. I mark this place now. Oh God, my life will never be the same. &gt;&gt; Joel's life's never been the same. Michael's life's never been the same. Andrew's life has never been the same. &gt;&gt; You're the same God tonight. &gt;&gt; You're the same God &gt;&gt; from young people in Belgium and young people from Switzerland and Lord God from China. Lord God, you see your children. You know where they're from. You call this meeting. &gt;&gt; You place this on my heart because you had a work to do. &gt;&gt; Lord, at the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; I pray we give ourselves to you just now. We give oursel to you just now. Oh God. Oh God. Could counselors come, ministers come. Let's just talk to him now. Could you just talk to him now? Could you just talk to him? Won't you reach out? Won't you reach out where you're at? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Moms, dads, where you're sitting. Where you're sitting. This your night, too. This is your night, too. How long has it been since you had a real revival stir in your heart? Would you say, "I want to just fall in love with him like never before. I just want to fall in love with him." &gt;&gt; Like never before. I want to fall in love with the living God. I want this to be a passion in my heart. I want it to be a passion in my heart. Hallelujah. God sees your tears. He knows your condition. He knows your situation tonight. [music] He knows the people that you will personally affect in your lives. He knows the situation and that's why he's called this meeting. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music] God bless you. God bless you of God. [music] Hallelujah.

I love you. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has done something very supernatural this evening. Very supernatural. You say, "Well, brother Tom, normally uh maybe get up and it's maybe a little bit enthusiasm. I want to punch something home." You know what? I live for moments like this. I live for the presence of God. &gt;&gt; That's what I live for, [music] saints. I don't want to interrupt him if he's doing something. &gt;&gt; I thought, well, I'll just step through the pulpit. Brother Ryan is he's doing a wonderful job song leading, but I know I step the pulpit then I got to close. I didn't want to close because I know what God does in a moment. &gt;&gt; That's what I know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know it because I heard it this evening and I can testify [music] of it. It's not something that's mental. It's something that's real. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they forgot. Brother Ron, I'm sure he could have gone on and on 10 [music] years ago, but there's a young man that's kneeling right here, praying for [music] a brother right here. 10 years ago, he was so cool. He had a jean jacket on with a fur liner at a 100 degree weather. Now that's cool. And brother Ron was just ending the service and he said, "I'm just out of here." And he got up out of his seat right over here [music] &gt;&gt; and he started to walk to the back of the gate. &gt;&gt; Something stopped him &gt;&gt; where Michael is. &gt;&gt; Something stopped him. And now he's right here. [music] &gt;&gt; 10 years Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because of that one decision. &gt;&gt; One decision. He's got a wife. He's here. He's works in the office. He loves the Lord. He takes prayer meetings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; In a moment. &gt;&gt; It's not history. It's not 30 years ago. &gt;&gt; It's right here, right now, young people. &gt;&gt; So, you say, "Well, brother Tom, I had maybe a little bit of a emotional." It's beyond the emotion. [music] &gt;&gt; It's it's to the resolve. I am resolved never to be that person [music] again. Not a camp meeting experience to another camp meeting experience. I heard of a little blind girl that went determined not to go home blind. That That's my kind of meeting. I see young people and I pray God may they come to this camp [music] determined not to go back the same &gt;&gt; resolved that the Holy Spirit the [music] first night can deal not that we just shout and sing and and and and have clap our hands but it's something that's happened in your heart and once that's happened I can tell you as a 21-year-old man now 64. [music] It's never grown old. &gt;&gt; I only want more of Jesus. &gt;&gt; I only want more of God. &gt;&gt; And so something happened tonight in your own life. You mark [music] that spot. &gt;&gt; Mark that spot where you were. Say, "I will never ever be the same again." Brother [music] Tom, let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. songwriter penned I want more of Jesus more and more and more. They might have penned that many years ago, but Lord, that's rung in my soul for years. I want more of Jesus. I want more of your word. I want more of you for you [music] are your word. What what a what a wonderful time, Lord, we've had this evening basking in [music] the presence of God, seeing young people being affected by the word. Would you continue [music] to move in their lives deeper, deeper in the love of Jesus? Father, I'm just praying God, as you have done, as many testimonies have been said tonight, still here tonight, 10 years, it still holds. They made a decision and in that decision, God, you've continued to [music] use it. May the decisions that are made tonight be eternal. And may Lord these young people leave tonight [music] with a deep resolve, a deep resolve for their love of Jesus Christ. [music] Bless your people as they'll go their way. Many will go on the road tonight. Lord, speaking of this meeting, may the angel of God come into their little vehicle. When they go to their cabins, Lord, wherever they will be sleeping, may the presence of God just wave after wave minister to their souls. Father, an unusual beginning. May you take us higher into that heavenly places where we have not experienced. Lord, I've had the pleasure and privilege to go certain heights in the lovely presence of Jesus, but I want to come higher, Lord, beyond what I've even thought of. to be lost in God, to be lost in the glory of your presence, worshiping you, [music] loving you. So would you bless each one of these young people tonight as they go to their cabins? [music] May it be an unusual evening for them. And God, may you come near them. Would you watch over all that will be leaving and making their way off of the camp? And Lord, if we have a tomorrow, may God your glory come down. And brother Andrew Spencer will be speaking in the morning. May our hearts be charged [music] with great expectation to hear what you've laid on his heart. &gt;&gt; Bless us now as we go our separate way. We're thankful for all that have made this meeting tonight, coming from so many different places. [music] We feel humbled and privileged that they would come and be with us at this camp. So go with [music] us now, Lord. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God be with you. As you make those that are not on camp, as you make your way quietly, I'm sure off the campgrounds, be careful. And cabins, if you wish to leave with your cabin, go. Your counselor, you know, uh the different rules, and [music] we just want you to enjoy the presence of God. Go when you want to go. If you want to stay, we're here. You're dismissed in [music] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; [music] [music]
