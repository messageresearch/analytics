[0:27] [Music]
[1:15] Oh Lord, your love is life
[1:20] to me.
[1:22] My truest longing.
[1:28] Oh, without you one moment, I don't know
[1:33] where I'd be.
[1:36] Your love is life.
[1:39] Your love is life to me, Lord. Your love
[1:42] is life to me.
[1:46] My truest longing, my deepest need.
[1:53] Without you one moment, I don't know
[1:57] where I'd be.
[1:59] Your love is life to me.
[2:04] [Music]
[2:07] Amen.
[2:09] It's good to see everyone this morning.
[2:11] Do you love the Lord?
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:15] Let's turn on the screen to number uh
[2:18] 11:18, the song we learned a couple of
[2:21] weeks ago.
[2:23] And uh I trust everyone knows what El
[2:26] Shadai means. Of course, if you're in
[2:28] the message,
[2:30] you heard Brother Brandham talk about El
[2:32] Shadai.
[2:34] And um we pronounce things differently.
[2:37] I you know we say hagi right and in
[2:41] Hebrew it's actually haggai. When I was
[2:44] over in Israel I I couldn't talking
[2:46] about these books in the Bible that I
[2:48] never heard of before.
[2:50] It's cuz they pronounce them the right
[2:51] way. And we've got this English messed
[2:54] up version. Anyways,
[2:57] brother Brandham said that L means the
[2:59] strong one. Shai, the sufficient one,
[3:02] the lifegiver, the almighty, the strong
[3:04] one. Abraham, you're a hundred years
[3:07] old, old and weak, but I am your
[3:09] strength.
[3:11] And I just finished going through the
[3:12] book of Job.
[3:16] Job drew his strength from El Shadai.
[3:20] Elshadai is used 48 times in the Old
[3:22] Testament. 30 of those in the book of
[3:24] Job.
[3:27] And this song also talks about Adoni.
[3:30] Adoni is Lord. Amen.
[3:35] It signifies ownership or masterership
[3:38] and indicates that God is the owner of
[3:40] each person and that he consequently
[3:43] claims the unrestricted obedience of
[3:46] everyone. I mean that's his claim on
[3:48] you. Amen. So when you say Lord Adonai
[3:52] and I one of the most moving things I
[3:55] ever saw was I was at the the hotel the
[3:57] Western Wall in Jerusalem and a rabbi
[4:01] um who Cindy and I spent some time with
[4:04] got up and he just started calling on
[4:06] God Adoni. Adonai. And to hear those
[4:10] words echo in that area I mean it was
[4:13] just you can sense the spirit of God and
[4:16] God you know we know he's moving off the
[4:18] gentile people. He's moving on into
[4:20] Israel. And I'm just so thankful that in
[4:23] this dark age, Amen, we've been able to
[4:26] see the light. So, let's stand and we
[4:28] can sing this song
[4:31] together. Let's just worship him,
[4:33] saints.
[4:35] Focus everything you have on him.
[4:40] Father of life, seated on your throne of
[4:46] grace,
[4:49] only by mercy we are saved.
[4:54] [Music]
[4:56] And Lord, you have said that if we call
[5:01] upon your name,
[5:04] we
[5:06] families would be saved.
[5:11] So we cry
[5:15] out to your name.
[5:23] God of praise
[5:28] for
[5:30] those
[5:34] Jesus Christ
[5:41] and we rely
[5:45] on your grace.
[5:52] Crown in praise.
[5:57] Lord
[6:00] most high
[6:04] Jesus Christ.
[6:11] Father of love, never failing to forive.
[6:18] Each moment is a gift from you to me.
[6:25] And we're only here to tell the world
[6:30] about your grace.
[6:33] Till the day you take us all away.
[6:38] Lord, we will cry
[6:42] out your name.
[6:46] El
[6:50] God of grace
[6:54] [Music]
[6:58] high
[7:00] Jesus Christ.
[7:06] We rely
[7:09] we rely Lord on your way.
[7:16] I crown in praise.
[7:21] Oh,
[7:27] Jesus Christ.
[7:32] [Applause]
[7:33] So we cry.
[7:40] [Music]
[7:43] I got praise
[7:51] [Music]
[7:54] Jesus Christ.
[8:00] We are
[8:04] glorious.
[8:06] [Music]
[8:16] [Music]
[8:25] [Music]
[8:27] Yeah. Heat.
[8:34] [Music]
[8:39] Hey
[8:44] [Music]
[8:46] Jesus Christ.
[8:50] [Music]
[8:57] [Music]
[9:10] [Applause]
[9:12] Jesus Christ.
[9:14] [Music]
[9:19] So many times I've questioned
[9:22] certain circumstances
[9:26] for things I could not
[9:29] understand.
[9:33] And many times in trials,
[9:37] weakness blurs my vision. It's when my
[9:41] frustration gets so out of hand.
[9:45] [Music]
[9:47] Instead, I am reminded that I've never
[9:51] been forsaken.
[9:53] I've never had to stand one test.
[10:00] As I look at all the victories, then the
[10:03] spirit rises up in me. And it's through
[10:07] the fire. My weakness is made strong.
[10:11] Oh,
[10:14] he never promised that would not be
[10:20] you would not be
[10:27] he never
[10:28] [Music]
[10:40] standing in the valley of
[10:45] the adversary stand
[10:49] [Applause]
[10:50] just
[10:54] will show up
[10:57] and he will take you to the
[11:01] king.
[11:03] I know. I know that in myself that I
[11:08] will surely perish. Oh, but if I trust
[11:12] the hand of God, he'll seal the flames
[11:15] again.
[11:22] He never promised that would not be
[11:28] or he would not be.
[11:32] Heat. Heat.
[11:35] [Music]
[11:45] See
[11:47] the way you say
[11:53] the adversary is
[11:55] [Applause]
[11:58] just

[13:10] make a way where there seems to be a no

[14:33] my guide.
[14:36] Hold me closely to his side

[20:39] Glory to God. I'm going to ask our
[20:41] brother Derek Paris. Brother Derek, if
[20:42] you'd come open the service service in a
[20:45] word of prayer, a request this morning
[20:48] from the Zacharys that we pray for
[20:51] family friend Bill Wright. He has
[20:54] suffered a major stroke. Their daughters
[20:56] asked that we pray this morning. And
[20:59] also there's a request,
[21:01] brother Bisced on that we have prayer
[21:04] for sister Angela Michel's mother lives
[21:07] in Switzerland. She's 89 years old and
[21:10] had a bad fall in the night. Resulted in
[21:12] a a cut uh seven or eight inches long.
[21:15] It required stitches. They just want to
[21:17] pray for her recovery and that there'll
[21:19] be no complications. If you've got a
[21:21] need this morning, just lift it before
[21:23] the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen.
[21:26] [Music]
[21:28] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[21:30] the Lord this morning. Why don't we just
[21:32] go to him in prayer now? Each and every
[21:34] one in your own way.
[21:36] Father, it's so good to sit at your feet
[21:39] this morning
[21:41] at the foot of Calvary, Lord, and lift
[21:43] our eyes,
[21:45] Lord. You are our help.
[21:50] You're our shelter, Lord. You're the
[21:52] cleft and the rock, Lord. When you come,
[21:55] you make a difference.
[21:57] The lame walk. The blind eyes are open
[22:00] and they see. The dumb speak, Lord.
[22:04] Lord, when you come near, lives are
[22:06] changed.
[22:08] Lord, you're the difference maker today.
[22:11] Lord, we're representation, Lord, of
[22:13] your grace.
[22:15] Lord, each of us that stand here under
[22:18] the banner banner of the gospel of Jesus
[22:21] Christ. We've come with open hearts,
[22:24] Lord. We've come with open minds, laid
[22:26] aside our own ideas, Lord, asking,
[22:29] Father, that you would speak once again,
[22:32] Lord, that you would take the man of God
[22:34] who set himself aside.
[22:37] Lord, he has studied. He's labored
[22:39] before you that he may come this morning
[22:43] and not bring his thoughts, but your
[22:45] thoughts. He would bring your word,
[22:47] Lord, that's eternal. That it could have
[22:49] a value and a benefit in our lives
[22:52] today. Lord, give us ears to hear. Give
[22:56] us eyes to see. Lord, if there's any
[22:59] sick among us, may you come and heal
[23:01] them, Father. Lord, there have been
[23:03] requests that have been penned down.
[23:06] Lord, in Switzerland, out on this
[23:08] streaming audience this morning, Lord,
[23:10] members of our own congregation are
[23:12] desiring for a healing touch from the
[23:15] master. Trouble the water once more.
[23:19] Lord, sometimes we know what it takes to
[23:21] be healed, but Lord, there is no one to
[23:24] take us any further. We're asking, Lord,
[23:26] that you would come. You would take us,
[23:29] oh God, into your hands this morning.
[23:32] Give us the strength to reach out and
[23:34] touch the very hem of your garment. Oh
[23:36] God, may faith arise in our souls,
[23:39] Jesus.
[23:42] Lord, not only for a healing of the
[23:44] body, not only for a healing of the
[23:46] spirit, but of the soul
[23:50] &gt;&gt; worth 10,000 worlds. Come and do a
[23:53] miracle in our midst this morning. We'll
[23:55] be sure to give you all the praise and
[23:57] the honor and the glory that's due your
[24:00] wonderful, marvelous name. We commit
[24:02] this service to you. The needs, Lord, of
[24:05] each and everyone's hand that was lifted
[24:07] before you. Those on the streaming
[24:10] audience, Lord, that are desiring to
[24:12] reach through the cloud of darkness
[24:17] to reach you, Father. Touch them this
[24:19] morning. We give it all to you in the
[24:22] wonderful name of Jesus Christ.

[25:30] the need of prayer.
[25:33] It's me.
[25:36] It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need
[25:39] of prayer.
[25:41] Not my father, not my mother, but it's
[25:44] me, oh Lord, standing in the need of
[25:48] prayer.
[25:50] Not my sister or my brother, but it's
[25:53] me, oh Lord, standing in the need of
[25:57] prayer. Well, it's me.
[26:01] It's me, oh Lord, standing in the need
[26:05] of prayer.

[26:13] prayer.
[26:16] [Music]
[26:36] Set aside
[26:39] I set
[26:42] for the Holy Ghost to pray through.
[26:47] [Music]
[26:48] I wait for words
[26:52] to reach these lips
[26:55] to set in motion
[27:00] change.
[27:02] I have no way
[27:05] by fleshly mind
[27:09] to know the glorious
[27:12] things he'll do.
[27:15] I'm just set aside
[27:20] [Music]
[27:22] in prayer.
[27:26] [Music]
[27:28] I abide.
[27:33] [Music]
[27:35] Impossible,
[27:37] unthinkable,
[27:40] amazing what God does.
[27:45] He orchestrates
[27:47] all circumstance.
[27:51] His ways are far above.
[27:56] The winds of sovereignty
[28:00] now blow across the saint that groans
[28:06] to convey the will of God on earth in
[28:12] human hearts reborn.
[28:17] [Music]
[28:20] Set aside.
[28:22] I separate
[28:24] for the Holy Ghost to pray through.
[28:29] I wait for words to reach these lips to
[28:35] set in motion
[28:38] change.
[28:40] I have no way by fleshly mind to know

[29:26] Faith gives forth an utterance
[29:31] my eyes can't visualize. eyes.
[29:36] Truth resounds
[29:38] within my frame. Though vile dark forces
[29:43] lie,
[29:46] these stages of deliverance
[29:51] are seasons to refine.
[29:55] [Music]
[29:56] hardship molded voices
[30:00] confirmed by supernatural
[30:03] signs.
[30:08] It's the victory of submission
[30:13] that releases the power of God.
[30:18] A selfless realm untouched by man where
[30:23] he reveals his will and plan.
[30:28] A father's faith reached a prodal son.
[30:33] Feeding with the swine
[30:38] legion the demon bound a man till the
[30:43] son of God restored his mind. And for
[30:47] one lost lamb, you leave the 90 and nine
[30:52] running,
[30:54] seeking,
[30:56] pursuing
[31:00] to restore them one more time.
[31:08] I'm set aside for the Holy Ghost to
[31:13] break through.
[31:15] I wait for words to reach these lips to
[31:21] set in motion change.
[31:25] I have no way by fleshly mind to know
[31:31] the glorious things he'll do. I'm
[31:36] satisfied.

[34:36] affirmative.
[34:38] And Allan was a a loose young man just
[34:41] drifting around and was
[34:45] doing a little bit of work in here. And
[34:47] and for some reason, I'm not too sure,
[34:49] but he came into my home
[34:52] uh right while Yolindy and her her
[34:54] parents were sitting in the front room
[34:56] visiting.
[34:58] And you know what happened? Just sparks
[35:01] instantly. Immediate sparks. And that
[35:03] was the end or that was the beginning.
[35:08] So this has a special special meaning
[35:11] for me. So here we are with you know
[35:14] some sparks that started in my front
[35:16] room and and now we've got all these
[35:19] children. My uh Joshua and Caroli is it
[35:25] good? Got that? Uh, and we're going to
[35:29] be dedicating Matthew.
[35:32] And we have also Elijah.
[35:35] I tell you what,
[35:37] we got a whole congregation right here.
[35:40] All we need is the spirit of all of
[35:42] these on the spirit of all of these on
[35:44] this family.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; So, we're we're dedicating Matthew
[35:49] especially, but brother Allan said he
[35:50] would like to dedicate the whole family.
[35:52] Uh, brother Allan, Sister Yolindi along
[35:55] with Sister Yolindy's family are living
[35:58] in Maine. They did live in Seattle and
[36:01] of course they're here visiting the
[36:04] family.
[36:06] Uh, Brother Don and Darla and brother
[36:09] Leon Leon and Brenda.
[36:13] And it's, uh, it's been too long.
[36:16] So, they're up in Maine at this time
[36:19] living there. And uh so we
[36:24] are praying that God will just guide
[36:26] them and lead them.
[36:29] Brother Brandham spoke about uh it was
[36:31] actually in a in a a service of water
[36:34] baptism but he said that the children
[36:37] are too young to be baptized.
[36:41] Matthew's too young to be baptized.
[36:44] And baptism is an outward expression of
[36:47] an inward work.
[36:49] a inward work of grace that's been done
[36:51] and the child cannot express it
[36:55] because there hasn't been any inward
[36:57] work of grace and because it's just a
[36:59] baby.
[37:00] But he said it's the parents
[37:03] bringing the baby to God
[37:07] who gave them the child giving it back
[37:09] to him in dedication. Those are very,
[37:13] you know, I know we understand that this
[37:15] act is that, but that's very, very
[37:17] powerful.
[37:18] And I was thinking since we spoke about
[37:21] having this dedication, brother Allen,
[37:23] of of when Moses, the prophet of God,
[37:26] the first prophet, gave the instruction
[37:29] for the family, and it was a dreadful
[37:31] time because death was in the land. And
[37:33] I would have to say death's in the land.
[37:35] Again,
[37:37] I'm sure that we all agree death is in
[37:39] the land everywhere. And outside of the
[37:42] token,
[37:44] death is everywhere.
[37:46] And God gave instructions through the
[37:49] his prophet at that time. And now,
[37:51] brother Brandham refers back to it in
[37:54] the token, a lamb for a house.
[37:58] And the only thing the lamb represented
[38:00] was a life. So we have to say a life for
[38:04] a house.
[38:05] And the father, brother Allan, was to
[38:07] take that lamb.
[38:10] And he said he could have had a barrel
[38:11] of blood at the door, but it wouldn't
[38:14] have done any good. And the eldest son,
[38:17] and you do have a son, that's the
[38:18] eldest, Joshua,
[38:20] and he would he would see the black
[38:22] wings of death coming through the land
[38:26] and hear the screams and the calls and
[38:29] and today, I tell you what, friends, we
[38:32] hear a lot of noise out there, but to
[38:33] me, it's just screams of death.
[38:37] Daddy, are you sure? Are you sure? And
[38:41] the only thing that the father could say
[38:42] we have done exactly what God's prophet
[38:45] has said.
[38:47] But the thing was that he stressed was
[38:49] it had to be applied
[38:52] and applied is lived. They had to
[38:55] actually live. And so the lives of you,
[38:59] brother Allen, and you sister Yolendi
[39:03] will have the greatest influence upon
[39:05] these children.
[39:07] And if we don't apply the life, and that
[39:10] is for all parents that are here, when
[39:13] you're living it, you're actually
[39:15] applying the life
[39:17] over the family.
[39:20] And that is what God's requirement. Take
[39:22] this word, this this message which God
[39:25] has sent the promise for this time and
[39:27] apply it to the family. And that's is
[39:30] that is the word of God and that's our
[39:33] promise. And so we dedicate Matthew to
[39:36] the Lord.
[39:39] Brother Brandham prayed a wonderful
[39:41] prayer.
[39:44] And I would like to just give a part of
[39:46] this prayer before I pray.
[39:49] Lord, we are indeed privileged people to
[39:51] live in a country where we still have a
[39:53] freedom of worship and where we have a
[39:55] government that protects us and gives us
[39:57] this God-given heritage that we do not
[40:01] have to go according to the state or
[40:03] church or some dictator type,
[40:06] but we can come to thee and that we're
[40:09] convinced in our heart. We pray that
[40:11] this will last long until Jesus comes.
[40:15] said, "How many people
[40:18] are bringing their little children day
[40:20] after day and week after week as you
[40:22] give them into our arms
[40:26] and the care of their father and mother,
[40:28] Lord, to us as elders of the church and
[40:32] we by prayer offer them to thee." And I
[40:35] pray God that you'll take each of these
[40:39] darling, these little darlings this
[40:42] morning and will consecrate their lives
[40:45] to thee. And bless their homes that they
[40:49] come from. And may their father and
[40:52] mother be so dedicated to you that the
[40:54] children will be raised up in a
[40:56] Christian home to serve you all the days
[40:58] of their lives. And I tell you that
[41:01] prayer, that's all I need is to have
[41:03] that prayer fulfilled.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; And we're going to dedicate Matthew to
[41:07] the Lord. Matthew, you're going to come
[41:09] to me. That's a boy.
[41:19] He's comfortable here on the platform.
[41:23] Heavenly Father, this darling child that
[41:26] you have given to brother Allan and
[41:29] Sister Yolendi,
[41:31] we're so thankful for Matthew that
[41:33] they've given him this name,
[41:36] Lord. And I pray that the Holy Spirit of
[41:38] God will rest upon this child all the
[41:41] days of his life. May he have a sweet
[41:45] peace about him. May he be a great joy
[41:48] in this family.
[41:50] I pray that you'll keep him in good
[41:52] health. And as he hears the name of
[41:55] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, he will come to
[41:59] love that name and love that person and
[42:02] love that presence that he when he gets
[42:05] understanding, he will love your word.
[42:08] And Lord, if it should be that he is
[42:11] living and and he's of the age of
[42:14] accountability, may he receive you into
[42:16] his heart. I pray that his father,
[42:19] brother Allan, and sister Yolindi, his
[42:21] mother, will live for you, oh God, all
[42:24] the days of their lives and be an
[42:26] example to him. I dedicate Matthew now,
[42:30] Lord Jesus, in your name, in the name of
[42:33] Jesus Christ.
[42:36] Amen.
[42:37] Amen.
[42:40] God bless Matthew.
[42:42] God bless you.
[42:45] to Lindy Joshua.
[42:48] God bless you. Hallelujah. What a fine
[42:51] family.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody feeling good?
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hungry?
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Nice to have
[43:04] uh you all here? I
[43:07] uh want to let you know also that
[43:09] brother Timothy Ma is back from Vietnam.
[43:13] We're thankful for that. About two and a
[43:16] half months in Vietnam. Was intending on
[43:20] being about three, but had a very
[43:21] profitable time. Brother Dier is back
[43:25] from Ghana.
[43:27] And I've already heard from Ghana that
[43:30] they've had a just an exceptional
[43:34] time in meetings, six services.
[43:38] So, we're so happy about that.
[43:41] And we are indeed thankful for uh the
[43:46] all of those that are streaming. You
[43:48] know, we speak about those that are
[43:49] streaming.
[43:51] And as we sit here, perhaps we don't
[43:53] realize that there's a congregation
[43:58] perhaps as many as are here and perhaps
[44:01] even more.
[44:03] And for those that are on the other side
[44:05] of the world, on the eastern side, they
[44:09] may not be able to get it until they're
[44:11] a able to archive the service or get it
[44:14] from the archives.
[44:16] But if you and I have not really checked
[44:21] recently at all, but it will be even
[44:26] four or 500
[44:28] locations
[44:30] within about a week's time that have
[44:33] logged onto the service and and the
[44:36] reason I appreciate
[44:38] I appreciate all those that are
[44:39] streaming is because they worship with
[44:42] us. They pray when you're praying,
[44:46] sing when you're singing,
[44:48] and listen to the word and say, "Amen."
[44:51] as God registers it to their heart. And
[44:53] I just want them to know today that we
[44:55] appreciate it with all of our heart. And
[44:57] may God bless them.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They send in their requests
[45:01] and desire that God will hear their
[45:05] prayers. And I know that he will. They
[45:07] love the same message that you love.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Oh, what a
[45:12] gathering that's going to be. What a
[45:14] gathering. What a time that's going to
[45:15] be. And so, we're really thankful. I
[45:18] wanted to also let the church know that
[45:21] uh I had mentioned at the last meeting
[45:23] that we were sending
[45:25] uh some some funds to to Moscow to the
[45:30] building of the church there. And uh we
[45:34] I just got a short email and I just felt
[45:37] a real pull in my heart. So I took a
[45:40] step of faith whether it's on behalf of
[45:42] those that are here present and and
[45:44] those that the Lord speaks to. Sometimes
[45:47] it's someone even on the internet that
[45:50] is streaming and saying you know God
[45:52] touched my heart. I've had pastors call
[45:54] me and say we'd like to be part of uh
[45:58] helping to build a church in Moscow.
[46:00] It's not building buildings or building
[46:02] an organization. Friends, what it is is
[46:04] just giving people a place to worship.
[46:07] They don't have a place to worship.
[46:08] There's three congregations right now.
[46:11] And so it's so so important. Uh and
[46:14] we've uh we we sent another $15,000 US
[46:19] this last week and wired it over. Uh and
[46:23] just to just to encourage them to keep
[46:25] keep it going. And I I've asked them to
[46:28] respond back to us and let us know when
[46:30] they might be able to be in, when it
[46:32] will be covered in, uh when they expect
[46:34] to perhaps have the first service. They
[46:37] were just putting they hadn't got the
[46:38] roof on yet. And so remember them. I I
[46:42] wish I could put on the screen for you
[46:45] their worship and their singing and in
[46:47] the uh under the difficult circumstances
[46:50] that they have. We're so privileged and
[46:53] I hope we never take
[46:56] uh the liberty that we have and the
[46:58] freedom that we have for granted. I pray
[47:00] that you all, young and old, will be
[47:03] thankful that you're living where you're
[47:06] living and you have the home that you
[47:08] have and you have the friends that you
[47:10] have. You have the church that you have.
[47:13] And uh as long as we're here, let's
[47:15] serve God with all of our heart.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you for that. I really appreciate
[47:20] that. And so I I hope that you will uh
[47:24] have trust and confidence. I really felt
[47:27] uh led of the Holy Spirit to do that.
[47:30] be praying for some meetings that are
[47:32] coming up in another week and a half in
[47:35] in in Switzerland and then about another
[47:38] three weeks later in in Germany as well,
[47:41] not far from Dooldorf. Uh and uh so
[47:45] we're just seeking to know God's will in
[47:48] all of these things.
[47:50] Amen. Before we uh read the scripture, I
[47:53] would like to have you stand and I want
[47:56] to sing two verses of a song of brother
[47:59] Rod, if you help us, please. Uh, whiter
[48:02] than snow. Whiter than snow. The first
[48:04] verse and the last verse. And I have
[48:06] read these over. I have sang these over
[48:08] to myself, and I want you then to to
[48:11] think about them. Also, uh, Brother
[48:14] Ernie, is there anything further about
[48:17] Brother Nanding?
[48:19] Uh, have we heard anything further? I
[48:21] spoke quite extensively about him on on
[48:24] Wednesday.
[48:27] Is there anything further just recent
[48:30] that you could
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. All right.
[48:37] All right.
[48:38] [Music]
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Perfectly whole. I want thee forever
[48:51] to live in my soul. Break down every
[48:56] idle, cast out every f. Now wash me and
[49:01] I shall be wider than snow. Oh, wider
[49:07] than snow. Yes, wider than snow. Now
[49:12] wash me and I shall be wider than snow.
[49:18] The blessing by faith I receive from
[49:22] above.
[49:24] Oh glory my soul is made perfect in
[49:28] love. My prayer has prevailed at this
[49:33] moment. I
[49:38] am whiter than snow.
[49:41] Whiter than snow. Yes, whiter than snow.
[49:47] How is the pride? I am wider than snow.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; I'd like to get that last verse up again
[49:55] so we can all sing it together. The
[49:57] blessings by faith I receive from above.
[50:00] I want that to be current.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:04] is made perfect in love. My prayer has
[50:06] been has prevailed and this moment I
[50:10] know the blood is applied and I am
[50:14] whiter than snow. Every person needs to
[50:16] know that. Have full assurance. Maybe
[50:18] have it reaffirmed within us. Let's sing
[50:21] that last verse again and then sing the
[50:23] chorus as a prayer please.
[50:26] The blessing by faith I receive from
[50:30] above. Oh glory, my soul is made perfect
[50:35] in love. My prayer has prevailed. And
[50:40] this moment I know the blood is a blood.
[50:45] I am quieter than snow. Oh, wer than
[50:50] snow.
[50:51] Wer than snow. The blood is not. I am
[50:57] wider than snow.
[51:01] Let's just join in prayer. Father,
[51:06] &gt;&gt; you're the author of salvation.
[51:09] You have designed this redemptive plan.
[51:14] You have ordained that we would be
[51:16] redeemed by the sacrifice of your own
[51:20] son, Jesus Christ. How willingly you
[51:23] gave yourself, Lord Jesus. How we love
[51:26] you because you first loved us. You
[51:29] loved us so much that you gave yourself
[51:32] freely.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; You gave yourself completely.
[51:36] You were able to say, "It is finished."
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; We are purchased.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; We are redeemed.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Satan's hold is broken.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Prison bars are broken and burst apart.
[51:52] Jesus. Oh, the gates of hell cannot
[51:55] prevail against the church of the living
[51:58] God. Father, we're based upon that firm
[52:03] conviction and foundation. Thank you for
[52:06] your word that has come. And now I pray,
[52:08] Lord, you will give your Holy Spirit to
[52:12] anoint the word, to utter the words, I
[52:15] pray. And may this day be a special day.
[52:18] I pray this morning and this evening,
[52:21] Father, as we gather, we gather, Lord,
[52:24] in this evening time, we gather in this
[52:28] end time, oh God, to prepare ourselves
[52:31] and make ourselves ready for what you
[52:33] have ordained and planned for us. Bless
[52:36] all who are with us on the internet and
[52:40] those that are throughout this building,
[52:41] Lord, and in the sanctuary. In Jesus
[52:44] Christ's name, we dedicate ourselves to
[52:47] you. Amen.
[52:50] And God bless you. Take your Bibles if
[52:52] you would, and I'll have you turn to
[52:56] Luke's Gospel, the 24th chapter.
[53:12] I will begin reading at verse 13.
[53:16] And this, for all of you that are not
[53:19] aware, this is the text
[53:22] uh to brother Brandham's second last
[53:26] service that he spoke.
[53:29] So that you'll just be mindful of that
[53:33] starting at verse 13.
[53:37] And behold, two of them went the same
[53:39] day to a village called Emmas, which was
[53:42] from Jerusalem about three score
[53:44] furongs. And they talked together of all
[53:48] these things which had happened. Notice
[53:50] what they were talking about. And it
[53:52] came to pass that while they communed
[53:55] together, number one, and reasoned,
[53:58] number two, Jesus himself drew near and
[54:01] went with them.
[54:03] And their eyes were holden that they
[54:05] should not know him. And he said unto
[54:08] them, "What manner of communication are
[54:11] these that you have one to another, as
[54:14] you walk, and are sad?" And the one of
[54:17] them whose name was Cleopus answering
[54:20] said unto them unto him, "Art thou only
[54:24] a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not
[54:26] known the things which are come to pass
[54:29] there in these days?" And he said unto
[54:31] them, "What things?" And they said unto
[54:33] him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth,
[54:36] which was a prophet, mighty in deed and
[54:38] word uh before God and all the people,
[54:42] and how the chief priests and our rulers
[54:44] delivered him to be condemned to death,
[54:46] and have crucified him. But we trusted
[54:49] that it had been him had been he which
[54:53] should have redeemed Israel." And beside
[54:56] all this, today is the third day since
[54:59] these things were done. Yay. And certain
[55:02] women also of our company made us
[55:05] astonished, which uh were early at the
[55:08] sephiler. And when they found not his
[55:11] body, they came, saying that they had
[55:14] also seen a vision of angels, which said
[55:17] that he is alive. And certain of them
[55:19] which were with us went to the sephiler,
[55:23] and found it, even as the women had
[55:25] said, but him they saw not. Then he said
[55:30] unto them, "Oh fools, and slow of heart
[55:33] to believe all that the prophets have
[55:35] spoken, ought not Christ to have
[55:37] suffered these things, and to enter into
[55:41] his glory?" And beginning at Moses and
[55:44] all the prophets, he expounded unto them
[55:47] in all the scriptures the things
[55:50] concerning himself. Amen. And may God
[55:52] bless his word and bless you and us
[55:55] together as we
[55:57] look at the scriptures.
[56:12] Just while we settle ourselves and
[56:16] just ask for your kind attention.
[56:20] Be real.
[56:23] focused if you would. Sometimes the uh
[56:26] things that God, you know, stirring in a
[56:29] in my heart at least, I can only speak
[56:31] for myself,
[56:33] uh is is very difficult to convey and
[56:36] and so we spend time studying, but a lot
[56:40] of my concern is for myself to be able
[56:43] to be a vessel so that I would be able
[56:47] to convey to you the way it comes to me.
[56:50] And that's not always very very clear
[56:52] because it's hard to take spiritual
[56:54] things and these are things that are
[56:56] from another realm, another dimension,
[56:58] try and bring them down into
[57:01] our world and into the realm of our
[57:03] understanding. And that's not really
[57:05] simple. So we need the spirit of God to
[57:08] give us inspiration, not just the
[57:11] speaker but everyone together. So we
[57:13] have inspiration so that we have
[57:15] revelation of the Holy Spirit. Uh now,
[57:22] brother Brham's last Easter message,
[57:26] actually I spoke a good deal about it
[57:28] last Sunday. His last Easter message was
[57:32] it is and notice very carefully, it is
[57:35] the rising of the sun. Not is it the
[57:38] rising of the sun, it is the rising of
[57:40] the sun. So now here's here's Almighty
[57:44] God and he has
[57:46] a a prophet messenger
[57:49] that has now for 33 years covered the
[57:54] earth with a ministry that has not been
[57:58] since the first man Adam walked. Amen.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; There is no record in the scripture
[58:04] where anything of this nature ever took
[58:07] place where a man stood before
[58:10] tens of thousands, hundreds of
[58:13] thousands. And if you a the aggregate
[58:16] number would be into the millions, seven
[58:19] times around the world, whether it be in
[58:22] Bombay or Durban or whether it be in
[58:25] Johannesburg or Houston or Chicago or or
[58:29] or Helsinki, Finland, where the boy was
[58:32] read raised from the dead and lives
[58:34] today, I understand, as a policeman. uh
[58:38] how how does how does uh a ministry like
[58:41] that not capture the world?
[58:45] &gt;&gt; How do how is the ministry of Jesus? How
[58:48] did it not even capture Palestine?
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Because there's other forces and there's
[58:53] a very clear it's very evident that that
[58:56] uh this is Satan's Eden as the scripture
[58:59] has said. And uh and so uh now this last
[59:05] uh the last Easter service I will call
[59:08] it the resurrection message. It is the
[59:11] rising of the sun. God is giving an
[59:14] announcement and he knows that God alone
[59:18] knows that in a few short months this
[59:20] messenger's gone passed off the scene.
[59:24] And if you watch the me if you watch the
[59:26] messages carefully 1965 messages uh now
[59:31] it is the rising of the sun he brother
[59:34] Brandham goes to Mark the 16th chapter
[59:38] which begins out begins like very early
[59:42] in the morning the women went to the
[59:44] selicer. It gives that account.
[59:47] And then his second last service. Now
[59:50] that was the that was the resurrection
[59:53] or Easter. We'd say Easter, but I'll
[59:56] call it the resurrection message. His
[59:58] last one. It is the rising of the sun.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; And he stated very very clearly in that.
[1:00:07] It was a declaration.
[1:00:09] He tells of the sword in his hand. tells
[1:00:13] of the angels that came. Uh speaks of
[1:00:17] the quickening power, speaks of that the
[1:00:20] bride is just is just unequivocal. The
[1:00:24] bride is a part of the bridegroom.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; She is flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:00:30] his bone and spirit of his spirit. and
[1:00:32] how God created the uh first Adam and
[1:00:36] took from him the feminist spirit and
[1:00:39] put it in his wife. Uh and and they were
[1:00:42] they were one and the same. Now he's
[1:00:45] reaffirming and establishing all of that
[1:00:47] and it is the rising of the sun that
[1:00:50] we're back there again. And then his
[1:00:53] second last service, he comes to the
[1:00:56] same the same account only it's in
[1:01:00] Luke's gospel. And and you've heard me
[1:01:03] say this many times, but I I need to
[1:01:06] really captivate your mind with it. He
[1:01:10] brother Brandham now for the first time
[1:01:12] calls the resurrection
[1:01:15] uh the resurrection chapter.
[1:01:19] He calls it modern modern events. Not
[1:01:22] historical events. Not the event that
[1:01:25] happened in Luke 24 made clear but a
[1:01:30] modern event.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Made clear
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; by the prophecy.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; So now Luke 24 becomes a prophecy. Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; And we need to as you read that and as
[1:01:42] you look at that, you need to understand
[1:01:44] that God's messenger just maybe 4 hours
[1:01:48] of of preaching left on earth is telling
[1:01:52] everyone who has ears to hear that that
[1:01:55] chapter contains a prophecy.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; And a prophecy is something that is
[1:02:02] foretold that is to take place. And the
[1:02:06] key, the secret of it lays there because
[1:02:09] it is a prophecy. He said now in modern
[1:02:12] events,
[1:02:13] now it's always been the unchanging
[1:02:16] God's way to let his people forno before
[1:02:22] certain events happen.
[1:02:25] So he's he's starting out by telling it
[1:02:28] that the he said if the people in the
[1:02:30] days of the Lord Jesus would have only
[1:02:33] sought God
[1:02:35] and had known what was just about to
[1:02:38] take place. They would not have
[1:02:41] condemned Jesus to death. But the reason
[1:02:44] it was because the scripture had to be
[1:02:47] fulfilled because the Jews had to be
[1:02:49] blinded. Now the scripture has to be
[1:02:52] fulfilled. Amen.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; That is certain. But it does not mean
[1:02:56] that we have to be uh we don't have to
[1:03:00] be blinded. We don't even have to have
[1:03:02] our vision obscured.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Uh we can live in the full measure of
[1:03:07] our promise.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; And he said, so he said, uh do you
[1:03:14] realize
[1:03:16] uh that that's promised again
[1:03:19] in this very age that we're living in?
[1:03:21] They did what they did because they
[1:03:23] didn't know the scripture and they were
[1:03:25] blinded.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; And he said that that's promised again
[1:03:29] in this very age that we're living in.
[1:03:32] The Leodysian church, this seventh
[1:03:34] church age that we're living in now is
[1:03:37] naked, miserable, blind, and don't know
[1:03:40] it. The same as he blinded them back
[1:03:44] there for the purpose of getting his
[1:03:47] message through to the elected people.
[1:03:51] He's promised to do the same thing
[1:03:54] today.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; You re you realize what he's saying is
[1:03:58] that the blindness that's in the land
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; if they had if they had just received
[1:04:05] the whole world, if the governments had
[1:04:08] received it, if the uh the Vatican had
[1:04:11] received it, if all the uh leaders,
[1:04:16] religious leaders and theologians had
[1:04:18] received it, you wouldn't have Right?
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Because it wouldn't have been it
[1:04:24] wouldn't have been a pure thing. They
[1:04:27] had to bl be blinded to it
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; so that the elected would receive it.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Part of the reason you received it is
[1:04:36] because it has been rejected.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Now you may not understand that
[1:04:40] completely but just listen closely as we
[1:04:43] go.
[1:04:45] And then here in this scripture it is
[1:04:47] saying and they said and he said unto
[1:04:50] them oh fools and slow of heart to
[1:04:53] believe all that the prophets have
[1:04:55] spoken. And I want to dwell on that in a
[1:04:58] in a few moments.
[1:05:01] So now and also in the per P per Panian
[1:05:04] church age he said everything that's
[1:05:06] written in the Old Testament that is in
[1:05:09] story form is written for our admonition
[1:05:13] so that we can learn from it. There's
[1:05:16] some scriptures which we have now all uh
[1:05:20] these things apostle Paul said to the
[1:05:22] Corinthians that all these things
[1:05:24] happened unto them. He spoke about how
[1:05:27] all were under the cloud and all crossed
[1:05:30] the Red Sea and all drank from the water
[1:05:34] of the rock. But he said, "Now all these
[1:05:37] things happened unto them. Some of them
[1:05:39] murmured and many fell in the wilderness
[1:05:42] and and they died in the wilderness and
[1:05:44] those that were 20 and under and and
[1:05:46] they were past probably 50 years old
[1:05:48] when they went in under Joshua." But
[1:05:50] now, Apostle Paul is going back and he's
[1:05:53] saying this. All of these things
[1:05:56] happened unto them for our example or in
[1:06:01] samples.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; All of it happened unto them and they
[1:06:05] are written for our admonition. Now he
[1:06:09] is Apostle Paul 2,000 years ago is
[1:06:13] drawing back some more time and speaking
[1:06:16] about Moses and saying all of that
[1:06:19] happened back there for your example and
[1:06:22] for our admonition.
[1:06:24] Now comes a messenger in the end time
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; and he goes back to Luke 24 and he's
[1:06:32] saying this was written
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; and this happened to them
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; for our admonition and our example
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; I hope you can catch that
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; then because that's really the basis
[1:06:45] this happened to those people these two
[1:06:48] men on the way to Emmas this
[1:06:50] resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:52] and the people that were involved. Those
[1:06:55] things happened to them. Now, we
[1:06:58] wouldn't have known that. It would have
[1:06:59] just been an account of the resurrection
[1:07:02] except a messenger with thus said the
[1:07:04] Lord says this is a prophecy for us.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; I can't overstate that. I can't
[1:07:12] overemphasize that
[1:07:16] in the end time seed sign.
[1:07:20] He says, "All of us believe that we're
[1:07:21] in the end time.
[1:07:24] Any man that's intelligent, I believe if
[1:07:27] he would look around and see, it shows
[1:07:30] this that these things can't go on much
[1:07:33] longer. Anyone knows that something's
[1:07:36] got to happen. Here's the here's the
[1:07:39] point. All the scripture point to it."
[1:07:43] So now he's he's taking the scriptures
[1:07:45] and and that's what I want you to to see
[1:07:47] with me is where are the scriptures
[1:07:50] pointing? What are they pointing to? And
[1:07:53] what does that mean for us? And how
[1:07:55] should we respond? How should it uh
[1:07:58] affect our lives? My daily life, your
[1:08:01] daily life, how should it affect us
[1:08:04] in spiritual food in due season? And now
[1:08:07] here we are in due season in this end
[1:08:10] time. We notice here again, if the word
[1:08:13] is in us and has come to us as it did to
[1:08:16] Elijah in that day, it'll do the same
[1:08:19] thing that he did. He would feed on the
[1:08:22] secret things of God
[1:08:24] which is hid from the world because
[1:08:27] they're blinded to it. But he would be
[1:08:30] feeding on it. And he says it's hid to
[1:08:33] the world. And he says, "Oh, again, it
[1:08:36] makes the message and the messenger is
[1:08:38] one. The spiritual food I have it
[1:08:42] highlighted. The spiritual food is ready
[1:08:45] and it's in the season now.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; All we have to do is is I hope that we
[1:08:52] don't just listen to a Sunday morning
[1:08:54] service this morning. I'm seeking to
[1:08:56] draw out scripture out of the that the
[1:08:59] messenger has uh has selected that God
[1:09:03] if I believe in that thus sayeth the
[1:09:05] Lord. If I believe that there's the
[1:09:07] spirit of Elijah, as Elijah was called
[1:09:11] and sent out and protected, went to a
[1:09:14] secret place and fed. God secretly fed
[1:09:17] him. The world didn't know anything
[1:09:18] about it, but he was feeding on it.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; And he knew. No one had to come and
[1:09:23] educate him that this was food in due
[1:09:25] season.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; This is food to sustain me in this
[1:09:29] drought time.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now we have the same
[1:09:33] spirit that is drawing the the promises
[1:09:37] of God and pointing it to a certain
[1:09:40] elect people. The blind will not accept
[1:09:43] it, will not receive it. But he says
[1:09:46] that this is our food in our season.
[1:09:49] This is here to carry us through to the
[1:09:52] objective timels
[1:09:56] his faith expressed. He says, "Remember
[1:10:00] Abraham wasn't in Sodom.
[1:10:04] He was already called out."
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; We can say amen to that.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; He was already called out. And there was
[1:10:11] one stayed and talked with him.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; In the scripture which we in our
[1:10:17] scripture reading today,
[1:10:21] it says, "And Jesus himself drew near."
[1:10:26] And I love the next words. And went with
[1:10:32] them.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't just leave them to go down the
[1:10:39] path by themselves, but he drew near and
[1:10:42] he went with them.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Even our father Abraham, he was already
[1:10:51] called out.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And there was one that
[1:10:54] stayed with him." Amen.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; The other two went to Sodom.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Two Sodom and Gomorrah went to the city.
[1:11:01] And there was one that stayed with him
[1:11:02] and talked with him. And the one stayed
[1:11:05] and talked to him, showed him a sign
[1:11:08] with his back turned. He said Sarah was
[1:11:11] going, "See, I have to I have to speak
[1:11:14] this to you with every ounce of energy I
[1:11:17] have because I am a witness to you. I
[1:11:20] sat on the platform. I saw him turn his
[1:11:23] back. I saw him look up to the to the
[1:11:27] balcony, not the balcony, but the gable
[1:11:29] of the building, and call out people
[1:11:32] that I personally knew and tell them of
[1:11:35] events that I personally was aware of
[1:11:38] and even directly speak uh the burden of
[1:11:42] a man's heart and who he was praying for
[1:11:45] and where that man was at that moment.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; That is a sign of the resurrection, my
[1:11:52] brother.
[1:11:54] That's a sign of the resurrection.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; This testimony is for you people
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; if you'll receive it.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; There may be a day, young people, that I
[1:12:03] won't be here. Don't forget that I stood
[1:12:06] here as an eyewitness and told you that
[1:12:09] the the sign of the resurrection has
[1:12:12] come.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; And you will not see it again.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; God will not raise it up again. He did
[1:12:21] it. He did it once
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; 33 years. The same length of time as
[1:12:26] Jesus life.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus came and in his servant revealed
[1:12:31] himself again.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; And it is a resurrection sign.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; So these scriptures are not for people
[1:12:37] hundreds of years up the road. It's for
[1:12:40] some that are going to experience it
[1:12:41] now.
[1:12:44] [Music]
[1:12:47] When brother Brandon preached it is the
[1:12:50] rising of a sun, it was his last
[1:12:53] resurrection Easter service
[1:12:56] and now his second last service as I
[1:12:59] said earlier
[1:13:02] was the same account
[1:13:05] out of Luke 24
[1:13:08] calling it a prophecy. But he starts not
[1:13:12] at the first verse. It says very early
[1:13:14] in the morning
[1:13:16] where he did at Easter, but he starts
[1:13:20] partway in the chapter. And two of them
[1:13:23] were on the way to Emmas because right
[1:13:26] at that point it is post
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; resurrection.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Very important.
[1:13:36] So now from his last Easter service
[1:13:40] to his second last service
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; that he would ever speak. Now he starts
[1:13:46] the chapter the same account but post.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Just after the resurrection.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Remember Abraham wasn't in Sodom.
[1:14:04] one stayed with him
[1:14:06] with his back turned and he said Sarah
[1:14:09] was going to have a baby and we know
[1:14:12] that that child Isaac was a type of
[1:14:15] Christ. We're waiting and he waited on
[1:14:18] him.
[1:14:20] He said now that brings to pass today.
[1:14:25] that brings to pass today because we
[1:14:29] have faith and I know that this is of
[1:14:31] God is because this and other scriptures
[1:14:35] point to this hour.
[1:14:38] So he himself as the messenger was going
[1:14:41] back and taking the scriptures of
[1:14:43] Abraham seeing Elo Elohim stayed with
[1:14:46] him seeing that one revealed the secret
[1:14:50] of of Abraham's heart of Sarah's heart
[1:14:53] and gave the promise he revealed the
[1:14:56] secret of their heart but then added to
[1:14:58] it and I will surely come return unto
[1:15:02] thee according to the time of life I
[1:15:04] personal pronoun will surely return unto
[1:15:06] thee according to to the time of life
[1:15:08] and Sarah shall have a son. And here he
[1:15:11] said, "We're waiting for that son."
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; So it went from Abraham to this
[1:15:16] prophet's time. He says, "I know that
[1:15:18] this is of God because it's it points to
[1:15:21] the today. It points to now."
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; And now I'm pointing to scriptures which
[1:15:27] he spoke and left out pointing to this
[1:15:30] time.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You ought to listen to
[1:15:34] things that are to be. Those
[1:15:36] denominational people were there because
[1:15:38] it was Christian businessmen.
[1:15:42] And the atmosphere, you can almost cut
[1:15:44] it with a knife. It's ice cold.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; It's unresponsive.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; And he he drew them out at the end and
[1:15:54] said, I he didn't want to chastise them.
[1:15:56] He didn't want to he's not angry. Didn't
[1:15:59] want but it was the truth. Yeah.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; And today, if we're not living where we
[1:16:06] ought to live,
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; then we need to expect to hear the
[1:16:09] truth.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Sufficiently so, so it'll jar us out of
[1:16:13] maybe the place that we're living
[1:16:15] presently because you might not be in a
[1:16:18] place where that word and where the
[1:16:21] current event is actually taking place.
[1:16:25] And we could be missing it like the two
[1:16:27] men on the way to Emmas.
[1:16:33] Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Now we have
[1:16:38] we have uh
[1:16:43] two areas.
[1:16:45] Those when apostle Paul said all these
[1:16:48] things happened to them for our
[1:16:50] admonition
[1:16:52] and those were destroyed in the
[1:16:54] wilderness.
[1:16:56] But now we come to this scripture. So we
[1:17:00] have some that were destroyed in the
[1:17:02] wilderness and they never went into
[1:17:04] their inheritance. But now we have
[1:17:06] others that are slow of heart.
[1:17:11] They're not murmurers and complainers,
[1:17:14] but they're slow of heart to believe
[1:17:18] all. They're tardy. I looked up the word
[1:17:21] to see uh because the scripture says in
[1:17:26] Hebrews, "Let us therefore fear lest a
[1:17:29] promise," and here I am with the
[1:17:31] promises out of things that are to be
[1:17:34] out of Luke the 24th chapter, not an
[1:17:37] account of the resurrection, but
[1:17:40] promises because it's already been uh
[1:17:43] I've already been notified ahead of time
[1:17:46] that this is a promise for us. These are
[1:17:49] a prophecy promises for you that are
[1:17:53] sitting here today. And we are being
[1:17:56] warned. Don't let it miss you or don't
[1:17:59] let you miss it.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me thus far? I'm going to
[1:18:04] go slow and be laborious over this. And
[1:18:06] so for those of you that are quicker in
[1:18:08] your mind, don't don't don't jump ahead
[1:18:11] because we we need to ponder these
[1:18:14] things very deeply. Let us therefore
[1:18:16] fear lest a promise being left us of
[1:18:19] entering into his rest any of you should
[1:18:22] seem to come short of it. And the word
[1:18:25] short fits right in with slow of heart.
[1:18:29] To believe all that the prophets
[1:18:31] foretold. To be short is to lack or to
[1:18:34] be behind. Just to be behind to be slow
[1:18:38] to be leisurely
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; to be casual about things. to be
[1:18:44] unhurried or to be delayed. When we're
[1:18:48] speaking about this, we don't want to be
[1:18:50] casual.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be delayed.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be just behind because
[1:18:56] that's exactly where the two on the way
[1:18:58] to Emmas. And I'm so thankful for the
[1:19:00] grace and longsuffering of our Lord
[1:19:03] Jesus Christ that he said he came on the
[1:19:06] pathway with them. What is this you're
[1:19:08] reasoning about? What is this you're
[1:19:09] speaking about? And went with them.
[1:19:13] because they were still they were under
[1:19:15] a cloud.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; They were believers but they couldn't
[1:19:19] see.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; And the prophet is saying to us, this is
[1:19:25] a prophecy of this time. And so I see
[1:19:29] here within the ranks of the message
[1:19:32] there are too many that are delayed,
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; distracted,
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; have their attention and their focus
[1:19:42] span too short. It's on something else
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; and are not prepared to lay other things
[1:19:49] aside and make this the main focal point
[1:19:52] of their life.
[1:19:54] Amen.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; If we miss this,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; we miss everything.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; after the resurrection's happened
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; and the saints have been changed and
[1:20:07] gone. I don't want to be here.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you out of my heart, I
[1:20:13] have fear for many that are in the
[1:20:15] message. Too many.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Some preaching has to be preached.
[1:20:20] Something has to be said to jar us out
[1:20:23] of our
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; out of our comfort zone.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Going to have to be a change of our own
[1:20:33] mind and our own thoughts and our own
[1:20:35] perspective
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; and our own agenda of what we have and
[1:20:40] we think is important. What you think is
[1:20:42] important needs to come down. I'm
[1:20:44] announcing that to you today. What you
[1:20:46] think is important needs to come down on
[1:20:49] your agenda.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; And what you hear on a Sunday morning or
[1:20:55] what you hear on a Wednesday or what you
[1:20:57] hear from any man God called man of God.
[1:21:01] And I feel very urgent upon myself as a
[1:21:04] pastor to say to you and try to be a
[1:21:07] shepherd to the flock to say to you that
[1:21:10] things which are perhaps are are just a
[1:21:13] Sunday go to meeting sermon young people
[1:21:16] and all that are here within the sound
[1:21:18] of my voice, it needs to come up to a
[1:21:21] different level.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I'm announcing to you today that these
[1:21:26] things need to become number one in your
[1:21:28] life.
[1:21:31] How can it be, brother Visll? I'm
[1:21:33] working. I've got a job. I've got a It
[1:21:35] can be on your mind all the time.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; When I shave in the morning, I'm
[1:21:41] thinking about the scripture. When I'm
[1:21:44] standing there combing my hair, I'm
[1:21:46] thinking about what God's plan is, what
[1:21:49] God has in mind. When I'm driving down
[1:21:52] the road, I got God on my mind.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; I got heaven on my mind. You can have
[1:21:58] him on your mind, too.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Washing the dishes, my sister. You can
[1:22:02] have him on your mind. And you need to
[1:22:04] have him on your mind. When is that
[1:22:06] resurrection taking place? Oh, God, let
[1:22:08] me be fully in tune.
[1:22:20] You know, we're in the NHL playoffs
[1:22:25] hockey.
[1:22:29] There's stations on the radio
[1:22:33] and it's the most amazing thing to me
[1:22:36] that they can almost speak 24 hours a
[1:22:39] day. Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; And all they're talking about is all the
[1:22:45] statistics.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; They can tell you who's first, who's
[1:22:49] second, who did this, and who bounced
[1:22:51] that ball, and do who made this basket,
[1:22:53] and who didn't do that, and what what
[1:22:56] salary he's getting, and who's open now
[1:22:58] for to be uh uh to be who who's a free
[1:23:02] market agent. I don't even know all the
[1:23:03] terminology. All I know is that they
[1:23:06] there's enough there for them to talk
[1:23:08] about it. and they are consumed.
[1:23:10] [Applause]
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; This message was sent to you to consume
[1:23:16] you.
[1:23:19] [Applause]
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Didn't come to sit on a shelf.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Didn't come to gather dust.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Didn't come for any other purpose. It
[1:23:27] came to consume you. And you should know
[1:23:30] more about Luke 24 than you know about
[1:23:32] any any uh any hockey team or any
[1:23:36] basketball team or any other team. You
[1:23:39] should know more about this.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; This is God's prophecy.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:46] [Music]
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; I'm burning up, friends.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; I might be preaching straight through to
[1:23:51] this evening, Brother Tom.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; I'm dead serious.
[1:23:57] I'm dead serious about it.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; So, we must not be slow.
[1:24:03] And the scripture says, "Seeing
[1:24:06] therefore it remainth."
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; That some must enter therein.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And I know that's even for this morning.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; There are some that are here that must
[1:24:19] enter in
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; because God has called you to it.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; And you know that God has called you to
[1:24:25] it. and it cannot take the place that
[1:24:27] it's had in your life in the past.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; I'm down at your address, folks.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; It's got to take first place,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; and I'd like to know if you're prepared
[1:24:41] this morning to give it first place. I
[1:24:44] don't want to expand this kind of
[1:24:46] energy, this kind of twisting up within
[1:24:48] my own soul and know that I'm preaching
[1:24:51] and giving everything I can to it and
[1:24:53] even examining my own heart day by day
[1:24:56] by day. I if I if we miss this
[1:24:59] resurrection, we miss absolutely
[1:25:01] everything.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord Jesus, come on to my pathway
[1:25:08] and go with me all the way.
[1:25:12] You talk about a double measure of grace
[1:25:14] went with them to their own place to
[1:25:17] their own house and would not let them
[1:25:19] go till they expressed the character in
[1:25:23] them invited him into their home.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; And you need to express that character
[1:25:29] and invite him in to every area of your
[1:25:32] life,
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; to every part of your life.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:40] Slow,
[1:25:46] oh fools, he said, and slow of heart
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; to believe all
[1:25:54] that the prophets,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; have spoken,
[1:25:58] slow,
[1:26:01] is dull,
[1:26:03] or of an inactive mind.
[1:26:11] It's amazing what can capture our
[1:26:14] attention.
[1:26:22] If you're completely taken over with
[1:26:26] what the baby beside you is doing
[1:26:32] or someone else
[1:26:35] and you're focused on that,
[1:26:38] you're not you're not able to really
[1:26:40] capture what the Holy Ghost perhaps is
[1:26:43] trying to convey to you. And you know,
[1:26:45] Satan's just smart enough to do that.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; I was in a meeting. Brother Ernie's been
[1:26:51] in lots of meetings, outdoor and
[1:26:54] semioutdoor meetings,
[1:26:56] and a cat walked in.
[1:27:00] Why? You'd have thought the king of
[1:27:02] England or the president of the United
[1:27:03] States walked in.
[1:27:06] Everybody just the whole meeting came to
[1:27:07] a grinding halt. They all just look that
[1:27:09] cat.
[1:27:11] I just stopped preaching.
[1:27:14] And after a few moments, I said, "That's
[1:27:16] a cat."
[1:27:18] And the people caught how foolish it was
[1:27:21] for them
[1:27:22] to have been distracted
[1:27:25] and interrupt perhaps an anointed
[1:27:29] message because a cat walked in. Never
[1:27:32] saw a cat before. If the cat walked down
[1:27:35] the street, would they all stop on the
[1:27:37] street? Oh, no. It's the devil
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; that gets people distracted because he
[1:27:43] wants them distracted.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Inactive mind or slow to apprehend.
[1:27:52] Slow to take a hold of it. Heard it.
[1:27:56] Heard it. Heard it. Was touched. Yes,
[1:27:59] God spoke but failed to take a hold of
[1:28:02] it. Apprehend it. Apostle Paul said that
[1:28:06] I may apprehend that I may take a hold
[1:28:09] of that for which I am apprehended. He
[1:28:13] knew he had been apprehended. He knew
[1:28:15] that he had the shackles on him and he
[1:28:18] was a prisoner of the word of God.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Now their lives, these two on the way to
[1:28:28] Emmas, their lives are living out a
[1:28:32] prophecy for you. Exactly as the Apostle
[1:28:34] Paul said, those in the Old Testament
[1:28:37] were living out a prophecy for the
[1:28:40] people of his time.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; So they're examples unto us.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Now, in the message, Events Made Clear
[1:28:54] by Prophecy, I would like to have had
[1:28:56] some of this on the screen for you, but
[1:28:58] I'm not I didn't have the time to do
[1:29:00] that.
[1:29:04] Brother Brandham says,
[1:29:06] and this are just a some uh some uh
[1:29:10] sentence, brief sentences, paraphrasing
[1:29:13] it. Said, "The Bible is a different
[1:29:15] book." Now, some of this is so
[1:29:17] elementary. Don't pass over it.
[1:29:21] Apprehend it. The Bible is a different
[1:29:24] book.
[1:29:26] It's a book of prophecy foretelling
[1:29:29] future events.
[1:29:31] It's also a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:29:35] all the way from Genesis to Revelation
[1:29:37] brings him out in his fullness of what
[1:29:40] he was and is. He said the Bible is God.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; In word form.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You're going to You got a Bible?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; That's God
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; in word form.
[1:29:59] and it is the book of God.
[1:30:03] He said the events that we see taking
[1:30:05] place,
[1:30:07] it's absolutely shown in the Bible of
[1:30:10] every age
[1:30:12] and we think we're out of cater.
[1:30:16] Now, the message today is to spread over
[1:30:20] a wide wide spectrum of believers
[1:30:24] from those that are slow to those that
[1:30:28] perhaps are far more advanced. And I
[1:30:31] also found and I have found and I've
[1:30:33] been concerned about
[1:30:36] even those who perhaps feel they're
[1:30:39] further up the road than others. But I
[1:30:42] have found where there are there are
[1:30:45] some and I've talked to some not just
[1:30:47] here but elsewhere and all of their
[1:30:50] enthusiasm, all their excitement is
[1:30:52] about what's going to happen, what's
[1:30:54] going to happen and and and and you know
[1:30:57] and the resurrection and the rapture and
[1:30:59] all the rapture and the rapture, listen
[1:31:01] friends, the rapture, you're going to be
[1:31:03] part of it if you're walking where
[1:31:05] you're supposed to be today.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham talks about what
[1:31:08] should we be doing,
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:12] What should we be doing now? He said, if
[1:31:14] you're hoing potatoes,
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; that's what you should be doing.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Said, if you asked me what I would be
[1:31:21] doing today, he said, I would be
[1:31:22] studying and preparing
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; for this meeting.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Even if I knew the Lord was to come, I
[1:31:29] would be studying and getting ready for
[1:31:31] this meeting. Now, hold on to that. You
[1:31:34] say, "Well, shouldn't we be looking for
[1:31:35] the rapture?" Not at the expense of
[1:31:38] missing what you're supposed to be doing
[1:31:39] today. I was even going to I was even
[1:31:42] going to address this message and call
[1:31:44] it ho your potatoes.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; I see that went over like a lead
[1:31:50] balloon.
[1:31:52] Ho your potatoes. Live your life. What's
[1:31:54] a use of having a great expectation for
[1:31:56] the future if we're not really walking
[1:31:59] in the fullness and and all all the I I
[1:32:02] would say the inspiration of this
[1:32:04] moment.
[1:32:09] have quite a bit to say at that.
[1:32:18] Here's how Luke 24 starts out.
[1:32:22] Now upon the first day of the week, very
[1:32:26] early in the morning,
[1:32:30] they came under the suppler, bringing
[1:32:32] the spices which they had prepared,
[1:32:36] and certain others with them.
[1:32:39] And they found the stone rolled away
[1:32:42] from the supplr,
[1:32:44] and they entered in and found not the
[1:32:46] body of the Lord Jesus.
[1:32:51] And I just give me your attention this
[1:32:52] way.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; They were never chastised for having
[1:33:00] prepared the spices.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; They were doing what they would normally
[1:33:08] do.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; They had heard him say that the son of
[1:33:12] man will suffer
[1:33:14] and be killed and be raised again on the
[1:33:18] third day. They heard that. But somehow
[1:33:21] it hadn't registered.
[1:33:24] It just hadn't registered with them.
[1:33:28] Now, this is a prophecy
[1:33:31] and I I would like to believe and I do
[1:33:34] believe and I I've taken this to a
[1:33:36] personal application.
[1:33:39] I expect that uh I may be
[1:33:43] I trust the Lord that I will be here for
[1:33:46] the rapture.
[1:33:49] But let me let me tell you about the
[1:33:50] very messenger.
[1:33:54] He studied
[1:33:56] and he prepared for a message called
[1:34:00] Trail of the Serpent.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; And he was going to anoint, don't think
[1:34:05] I'm reaching way out there. These women
[1:34:08] were going to anoint the physical body
[1:34:10] of Jesus Christ. The prophet messenger
[1:34:13] was going to anoint the spiritual body
[1:34:15] of Jesus Christ. He had a message that
[1:34:18] he was going to preach. He said in
[1:34:19] things that are to be modern events made
[1:34:22] clear. In fact, I'm sorry. He said in
[1:34:24] that message, I'm going to be preaching
[1:34:26] I'll be preaching uh the trail of the
[1:34:29] serpent. Uh if you get the tapes, get
[1:34:32] that tape
[1:34:34] on several times. He mentions, "I'm
[1:34:36] going to me I'm going to preach that."
[1:34:38] He was looking forward to it. He was
[1:34:40] anticipating doing that. And there are
[1:34:43] some that perhaps they feel it. He may
[1:34:45] come back and preach it. Uh by the time
[1:34:47] he resurrects, everybody's going to
[1:34:49] resurrect.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; He's going to come in a resurrection. Of
[1:34:57] course, he's coming back.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody, there'll be a general there
[1:35:01] will be a resurrection
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; of those that are asleep in Christ.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; But he anticipated as they anticipated.
[1:35:10] They anticipated anointing the body of
[1:35:12] Jesus Christ. He anticipated
[1:35:15] fact is don't don't be surprised. There
[1:35:18] will be perhaps hundreds if not
[1:35:20] thousands of messages that will be
[1:35:22] prepared and men will intend to there
[1:35:25] will be pray uh prayers prayed. There
[1:35:28] will be songs that people intend to sing
[1:35:31] and worship God
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; and you won't even get to utter the word
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; before you'll find yourself on the other
[1:35:38] side.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; That's going to happen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; This is the prophecy. And here in this
[1:35:44] prophecy, they prepared spices that they
[1:35:47] never got to put on the body of Jesus
[1:35:49] Christ.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; They were not they were not chastised
[1:35:53] for that. They were not they were not
[1:35:55] looked down for that. It was respected.
[1:35:59] They had It's It's written in the
[1:36:01] scripture.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; It's written in the scripture. It was
[1:36:07] part of it because it showed what was in
[1:36:09] their heart. They say, "Oh, God,
[1:36:13] it won't hurt my feelings if I don't get
[1:36:16] to preach a certain service or don't get
[1:36:18] to travel to a certain place. How how
[1:36:21] how all kinds of people prepare even in
[1:36:24] the natural they prepare for their going
[1:36:26] away and they want to do something.
[1:36:29] Maybe they want to do something for
[1:36:31] their family whatever more and never get
[1:36:33] to have it done.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean that the that the desire
[1:36:38] was wrong. We have a desire to do these
[1:36:41] things
[1:36:43] but we may not get to do it. And here
[1:36:47] are two that have believed the word.
[1:36:50] They they are I I could I would have to
[1:36:52] say that they were believers indeed.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Those that had lived in the time or in
[1:37:06] the time of the fulfillment,
[1:37:10] they had a very unique opportunity.
[1:37:13] The most unique opportunity. They had an
[1:37:16] opportunity of seeing the prophecies
[1:37:18] fulfilled. They had an opportunity of
[1:37:21] believing that it was God's word and
[1:37:24] thus becoming a part of that word or
[1:37:28] those that disbelieved and rejected it.
[1:37:30] These are the these are the things that
[1:37:33] uh these are the directions that people
[1:37:35] are able to go
[1:37:39] now
[1:37:42] in this post-resurrection time.
[1:37:46] Hallelujah.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:49] Now upon the first day of the week and
[1:37:51] very early in the morning they came
[1:37:54] under the sephiler I tried to walk with
[1:37:56] them.
[1:37:59] I wasn't just reading it as something to
[1:38:01] read but I went I I went on the pathway
[1:38:04] with them.
[1:38:07] And friends, the reason why I am so
[1:38:09] urgent about this within my own heart is
[1:38:13] because
[1:38:16] this is what I've been saying to myself
[1:38:18] this week.
[1:38:21] It can't be too far down the road.
[1:38:24] If God has God, if God has sent the sign
[1:38:28] of the resurrection,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; if he has sent the sign of the Messiah,
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; number two,
[1:38:39] if that was indeed the spirit of Elijah,
[1:38:42] number three,
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; and I have to say yes to every single
[1:38:49] one of them because it was not within
[1:38:52] the power of a man to do it.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Would you say amen to that?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Not within the power of a man to do
[1:39:00] that.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Please go with me
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; down my path this morning.
[1:39:07] If a man could not do it, who did it?
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; The devil didn't do it.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; A magician can't do it.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; This is not a hit and miss.
[1:39:21] This is not some generalization.
[1:39:23] Somebody's here with a pain or a stomach
[1:39:25] ache or a backachche,
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; This was specific.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; This was calling people out. Why was
[1:39:32] that? Because they were he was giving a
[1:39:34] sign of the Messiah. The Messiah did
[1:39:37] this.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Elohim did it to Abraham.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; This is very important. Some say might
[1:39:44] say, "Well, this is a first pull." Let
[1:39:46] me tell you, it is a powerful
[1:39:48] confirmation.
[1:39:50] Amen.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; This never happened before.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; So I'm asking this congregation and all
[1:39:57] who hear my voice, who did this?
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; And once we determine who did it, you
[1:40:03] ask the second question, why did he do
[1:40:05] it?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; And if you come to the same conclusion
[1:40:10] that I come to, he did it because it was
[1:40:13] this season
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; and that these are the people Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; You are the people.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; You did not bring yourself on the scene.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, my mother, my father,
[1:40:30] God Almighty gave you life.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; God Almighty gave you breath.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; God Almighty brought this message your
[1:40:39] way.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; God Almighty opened your eyes so you saw
[1:40:43] something the next person didn't see."
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; God Almighty did that. You could have
[1:40:47] been blinded to it, but God opened your
[1:40:50] eyes. And now we say, "Why did he do
[1:40:53] that?"
[1:40:54] Not to take you down a trail, not to
[1:40:58] take you down a path
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; and you become disillusioned,
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; And say, "Why?
[1:41:04] What's happening? What's happening with
[1:41:07] this message?
[1:41:09] What's happening?
[1:41:17] You think you have a difficulty?
[1:41:21] What if you belong to their
[1:41:23] congregation?
[1:41:27] Cleopus's congregation.
[1:41:30] Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James
[1:41:34] and Joanna and the other women that were
[1:41:37] with them
[1:41:40] and the 11 apostles. You think that they
[1:41:42] were holed up
[1:41:44] because they wanted to be there? They
[1:41:47] were holed up. Their treasure had just
[1:41:49] committed suicide.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; If the treasure of this church had just
[1:41:55] committed suicide, be honest.
[1:41:58] There'd be a lot of you folks be very
[1:42:00] disillusioned.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Could you look beyond that?
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; You would need to.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:11] You need to be able to stand up and
[1:42:12] declare that word is still true.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; I see all kinds of things happen in the
[1:42:18] message. And my wife, God bless her, she
[1:42:21] always says, "Well, it's those stable,
[1:42:24] steady, steadfast ones." That's what
[1:42:27] we're preaching for. That's what you're
[1:42:29] preaching for.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; I'm there because I'm here this morning
[1:42:35] because I believe there is a number of
[1:42:37] people. There is a group of people and
[1:42:39] there may be some here this morning that
[1:42:42] still have their vision a little bit
[1:42:44] dullled. Maybe they're a little late.
[1:42:47] Maybe they're a little delayed. Maybe
[1:42:49] they're a little bit distracted. I'm
[1:42:51] here to sharpen up your vision.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; And mine, too.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:11] The same one that walked with them
[1:43:15] is right here in this building today.
[1:43:21] And I want you to be aware
[1:43:23] that you'll be much more conscious than
[1:43:26] when you walked in
[1:43:28] that when you walk out
[1:43:30] there going to be one going.
[1:43:33] And he went with them.
[1:43:37] And he may ask,
[1:43:39] "What is this that you're troubled
[1:43:41] about?"
[1:43:44] He gets real close,
[1:43:46] real imate. What What is this you're
[1:43:49] communicating
[1:43:51] together between you?
[1:43:57] What is this that's so deep on your
[1:43:58] heart?
[1:44:03] Tell me.
[1:44:08] They began to tell him,
[1:44:11] "Oh,
[1:44:14] I hope if he asked you that."
[1:44:17] And I asked myself, I said, "Oh, God."
[1:44:21] The first words out of their mouth,
[1:44:24] "Haven't you heard about Jesus of
[1:44:27] Nazareth?" Right?
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Their first words
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; wasn't, "Well, Lord, I I lost my job and
[1:44:34] and I've been having such a hard time
[1:44:36] and my bills are piled up. Uh the job
[1:44:40] that I have, my work, my peers, my work
[1:44:43] associates, and oh, I'm having so much
[1:44:46] difficulty in my home, my wife, my
[1:44:48] husband, my children." No, it wasn't
[1:44:50] that. It was, "Haven't you heard what
[1:44:53] happened? Jesus of Nazareth,
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:57] one mighty in word indeed
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; He was a great prophet
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; and they begin to relate everything
[1:45:07] about him.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; I can tell you he loved every minute of
[1:45:13] it.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; And then he opened his mouth.
[1:45:22] And I believe this is just my own
[1:45:24] personal belief.
[1:45:30] I believe the spirit that was speaking
[1:45:33] through the messenger
[1:45:36] on his second last service telling you
[1:45:38] and I
[1:45:43] what is a prophecy for your for your
[1:45:45] day? This is a prophecy for your day.
[1:45:48] So this one came near to them and walked
[1:45:50] with them and went with them all the
[1:45:53] way. And while he was going,
[1:45:58] he began to he began to speak. And
[1:46:01] brother Brandham says, let's listen to
[1:46:04] the words that he quoted.
[1:46:08] I personally believe that this is what
[1:46:10] he quoted.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:14] I personally believe that that spirit
[1:46:16] that was speaking out of this
[1:46:17] messenger's mouth was telling us because
[1:46:21] this is our prophecy
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; was telling us specifically what he some
[1:46:26] some might say well it was just brother
[1:46:27] Brandham quoting some scripture I
[1:46:29] believe he was he might as well have
[1:46:31] been right beside them
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; said let's hear them
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; he said let's hear the words he quoted
[1:46:38] he said would you like to hear
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; what he said to them.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; He says he briefed them. Now they were
[1:46:48] briefed on all the late happenings. They
[1:46:50] knew about all the happenings
[1:46:55] and the story of the grave and the tomb
[1:46:57] and the women that had seen him and
[1:46:58] other ones said and they seen him and so
[1:47:01] forth and they'd been briefed on that.
[1:47:05] But then he began quoting the word and
[1:47:07] he said, "Now look,
[1:47:10] he must have quoted Zechariah 11:12."
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; For he was sold for 30 pieces of silver.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Was not the Messiah supposed to be sold
[1:47:20] for 30 pieces of silver? In Psalms 41:9,
[1:47:25] he was betrayed by his friends.
[1:47:28] Zechariah 13:7, he was forsaken by his
[1:47:31] disciples. In Psalms 35 and 111 he was
[1:47:35] accused by false witnesses in by Isaiah
[1:47:39] 35 and7 dumb before his accusers and he
[1:47:43] never opened up his never opened his
[1:47:45] mouth in Isaiah 50 and6 he was scourged
[1:47:49] he talked about that in Psalms 22 he
[1:47:52] cried at the cross my God my God why
[1:47:54] hast thou forsaken me all my bones they
[1:47:58] stare at me they pierced my hands and my
[1:48:01] feet.
[1:48:04] Isaiah 9:6, unto us a child is born, a
[1:48:08] virgin shall conceive.
[1:48:10] And in Psalms 22 and 18, they parted his
[1:48:14] garments among them.
[1:48:16] Isaiah 7, a virgin shall conceive.
[1:48:19] Psalms 22:7 and 8, he mocked him by, he
[1:48:23] was mocked by his enemy. He was supposed
[1:48:26] to be his friend, his enemies, the
[1:48:28] church. Psalms 22 again, not a bone of
[1:48:32] his will be broken, but they pierced his
[1:48:35] hands and his feet. Isaiah 53 and2 died
[1:48:38] by the male factors. Isaiah 53 and9
[1:48:43] bruised and buried with the rich
[1:48:48] with the rich brethren.
[1:48:50] Brother Brandham said
[1:48:54] as they quoted that and he went on just
[1:48:58] a three more in Psalm 16 and 10. He was
[1:49:02] resurrected from the dead.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; It was not I will not suffer my holy one
[1:49:08] to see corruption. Neither will I leave
[1:49:10] his soul in hell. He was raised from the
[1:49:13] dead. Malachi 3, John the Baptist was
[1:49:16] his forerunner. and all of these types.
[1:49:19] He might have went on even to Isaac
[1:49:23] being the type of him upon the mount
[1:49:25] upon the mountain where his father
[1:49:28] Abraham took him in Genesis 22. And the
[1:49:32] Bible says and they came to their place
[1:49:38] and they said, "Come in." But when he
[1:49:41] spoke these scriptures, their eyes were
[1:49:44] open. They didn't understand everything
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; but they understood now this was him.
[1:49:53] Friends,
[1:49:55] I feel very very moved.
[1:49:58] I'm not intending on trying to preach
[1:50:01] you some great outstanding service this
[1:50:03] morning.
[1:50:05] I came here to tell you these scriptures
[1:50:09] point to this time.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:13] these scriptures to those of you who God
[1:50:16] has opened up your understanding and has
[1:50:19] given you and said I am a believer
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; then you could join with them they are a
[1:50:23] believer
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; but now I'm standing here as a servant
[1:50:27] of Christ to tell you we cannot take
[1:50:29] casually we cannot relegate to some
[1:50:33] place back down in our life these
[1:50:35] scriptures these prophecies need to come
[1:50:38] and be preeminent
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; in our lives I'm talking about all of
[1:50:42] our lives in our daily life. And I would
[1:50:46] be pleased if I knew in my heart and
[1:50:49] soul as a result of this service that
[1:50:51] God anchored this so true in in the
[1:50:55] hearts of the people that they say, "I I
[1:50:58] am I I I've become obsessed with the
[1:51:02] promises that were left to us.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; I've been obsessed. I can't shake it off
[1:51:08] my mind. I'm thinking of it all the
[1:51:10] time.
[1:51:12] Amen.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:27] Brother Brandham was asked, "Should
[1:51:29] evangelists continue on the field?"
[1:51:31] Where are we at right now? This is what
[1:51:32] I'm asking. Should evangelists continue
[1:51:35] on the field? He said, "In this hour, of
[1:51:38] course." What they mean? Certainly, by
[1:51:41] all means, don't change a thing. If
[1:51:44] Jesus is coming in the morning, preach
[1:51:47] today like it was going to be 10 years
[1:51:50] from today,
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; but live like it's going to be in this
[1:51:54] at this hour.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Ho your potatoes.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Live your life.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Be the father. Be the mother. Be the
[1:52:06] young person God's called you to be. But
[1:52:08] let this be uppermost in your mind. I
[1:52:12] have been called by this voice.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; I've been called with the highest
[1:52:17] calling.
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; The highest calling.
[1:52:24] Would you tell somebody if the president
[1:52:26] of the United States or the queen of
[1:52:29] England or the prime minister of this
[1:52:32] nation called you this afternoon and
[1:52:34] said some friend of yours gave me your
[1:52:36] number and I I'm calling because uh I've
[1:52:40] got a special a special place for you.
[1:52:43] I'm we're having a special event and I
[1:52:46] want to invite you to this event. You'll
[1:52:48] keep that quiet.
[1:52:51] You'd be on the phone within moments.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; You said, "Guess what? You're not going
[1:52:56] to believe. I just got a call from the
[1:52:58] president."
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Some of you may not be impressed with
[1:53:02] that.
[1:53:05] But even if you thought you weren't
[1:53:06] being impressed with it,
[1:53:08] you get impressed.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Because it does something to the
[1:53:13] individual. you you begin to feel you
[1:53:16] know
[1:53:17] me
[1:53:19] I got this kind of a call
[1:53:22] uh even if you didn't go even if you
[1:53:24] weren't able to fulfill it you you were
[1:53:27] honored
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; right
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; that somebody thought of you
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you
[1:53:35] someone
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Yes sir
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; God himself
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; not some nebulous person or creature
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; but God.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; God with eyes.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; God with ears.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; God with a God with a mouth that speaks.
[1:53:53] God of Abraham. The God of Isaac. The
[1:53:57] God of Jacob. I'm talking about Elohim
[1:54:00] that came down and ate drank milk and
[1:54:03] ate meat with Abraham. And Abraham stood
[1:54:07] under an oak tree and watched him. I'm
[1:54:09] talking about that kind of God. I'm
[1:54:11] talking about a God that is so concerned
[1:54:14] about people that he would speak through
[1:54:16] a man's mouth and tell them about their
[1:54:18] little accident. You had a car accident.
[1:54:21] I'm talking about a God that knows when
[1:54:24] somebody uh was scared with a dog.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a God that knows the
[1:54:30] kind of complex you have
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; and he knows how that complex came and
[1:54:35] he's interested in removing it from you.
[1:54:39] He's interested in coming so close to
[1:54:41] you today.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a God that has a
[1:54:46] little man sit in his chair by the hour
[1:54:49] by the hour waiting on God to come here
[1:54:52] and just tell you this. And I feel
[1:54:54] honored. I'm talking about somebody who
[1:54:56] thought about you
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; before you were conceived,
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; before this nation was established,
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; before all the stars were in place. God
[1:55:09] thought about a certain individual.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; He thought about a certain character and
[1:55:14] he mixed and caused the seeds to mingle
[1:55:18] until a certain individual would come
[1:55:20] because he needs you exactly as you are.
[1:55:24] [Applause]
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need what you imagine
[1:55:29] yourself to be. He needs you as you are.
[1:55:33] He wants you as you are. He will do the
[1:55:36] changing. He will do the molding.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:59] There may be some here
[1:56:02] that will be the women.
[1:56:07] that will have made preparations.
[1:56:11] Maybe your preparations will be
[1:56:12] different. I I pray you don't consider
[1:56:14] this too simple and fundamental.
[1:56:18] Maybe you'll say,
[1:56:20] you know, we're going to have I I I just
[1:56:22] want to have I see someone's been a
[1:56:26] sister been way really discouraged,
[1:56:28] overweighted in the I just have the
[1:56:30] burden on my heart. So let dear how it
[1:56:33] be if we have them over to our place and
[1:56:36] just have them together and encourage
[1:56:38] them and give an evening and I'm going
[1:56:40] to prepare going to prepare a nice meal
[1:56:43] for them and we'll have them over
[1:56:47] certain evening
[1:56:49] and you prepare there going to be
[1:56:50] somebody there's going to be somebody
[1:56:52] trust me
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; there's going to be a woman that what
[1:56:56] are you doing you're wanting to bless
[1:56:58] the body of Jesus Christ
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; and you're standing right at your post
[1:57:03] of duty and you're doing your thing
[1:57:06] and and you won't need it,
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; You won't need the spice.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; You won't need the anointing. You won't
[1:57:14] need that
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; because you're going to find out
[1:57:19] he's not here.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; He's already risen.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; It's already happened. There's going to
[1:57:25] be a moment that there's going to be a
[1:57:27] flurry of people
[1:57:30] back and forth.
[1:57:32] They're going to be telling someone
[1:57:34] else. You think that's a You think that
[1:57:36] is some kind of mystic mythical thing?
[1:57:40] That's what happened in the Bible.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; I know a little bit about that presence.
[1:57:51] I I wish I could convey it to you. But
[1:57:54] one day,
[1:57:56] that same God that talked to you
[1:57:58] someplace along the line,
[1:58:03] you're going to become aware
[1:58:06] of a presence
[1:58:08] so intense.
[1:58:12] You'll feel as though,
[1:58:15] not that you're going to expire, but you
[1:58:16] feel as though you can't contain it.
[1:58:22] Don't tell me you've ever felt that
[1:58:23] because it's something like you've never
[1:58:25] felt.
[1:58:28] And it's going to be his presence from
[1:58:30] another dimension, from another realm.
[1:58:34] It's going to move. And I I I I wish I
[1:58:36] knew scientifically how it happens, but
[1:58:38] I don't know. All I can tell you is what
[1:58:39] a messenger said. And there'll be a
[1:58:42] sweep go over you.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a change in your
[1:58:46] atoms.
[1:58:48] You're going to find yourself
[1:58:49] immediately
[1:58:51] in another room. I can't. All I'm going
[1:58:53] to do is just tell you what the prophecy
[1:58:56] said.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; And the women came to the sele and the
[1:59:00] stone was rolled away and they looked in
[1:59:02] and but the body was not there. Listen,
[1:59:06] but the linen clothes were there.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; The body wasn't there, but the linen
[1:59:13] clothes were there.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when they came out,
[1:59:18] Mary sees a gardener
[1:59:21] in today's language, a landscaper.
[1:59:24] And we have a few right here in this
[1:59:26] church.
[1:59:28] He sees a she sees a landscaper.
[1:59:32] And he happens to be dressed.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Put that one in your mind and think
[1:59:41] about it.
[1:59:43] Where'd those clothes come from?
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; And he's in another realm.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; But they saw them. God allowed them with
[1:59:51] these eyes to see him.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Fully clothed
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; and looking like a young man, looking
[1:59:58] like a gardener. Nothing extraordinary,
[2:00:01] but yet he had a way. He had a way with
[2:00:04] one. We'll have a way with you that will
[2:00:06] be different from someone else. And for
[2:00:08] her, all she needed to do was hear her
[2:00:10] name. Right.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; And in the vortex, in the climax of that
[2:00:17] moment, he's gone. The clothes are
[2:00:20] there. The storms rolled away. The men
[2:00:24] in shining garments like a vision. And
[2:00:27] and and they're just caught up in their
[2:00:29] moving out. And here's where have you
[2:00:31] taken him,
[2:00:36] Ed?
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Would
[2:00:44] you like to hear your name?
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly who you are.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Mary
[2:00:53] Reon,
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; master
[2:00:58] go and tell my disciples. Go and tell.
[2:01:01] That'll be the first thing on the
[2:01:02] agenda. Not go home and prepare
[2:01:05] breakfast. Not go home. Not go to the
[2:01:06] shopping center. Not Walmart. Not
[2:01:08] something else. Go home. Go and tell my
[2:01:11] disciples.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; What else mattered anymore? Nothing
[2:01:15] mattered anymore. I got an appointment.
[2:01:18] Forget the appointment. I got an
[2:01:19] education. Forget the education. This is
[2:01:22] number one on the agenda.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; We've had a resurrection and my brother,
[2:01:26] my sister, we're either wasting our time
[2:01:28] here in this church or we are we are
[2:01:31] having that as our objective.
[2:01:34] Hallelujah.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; That's the objective.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. You'll eat.
[2:01:47] You'll have a bed to sleep in cuz he
[2:01:48] promised it.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; You'll make it through.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; But this is first and foremost.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Build everything, structure everything
[2:02:01] around this moment.
[2:02:04] I'm preparing for the resurrection.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; If it happens today, I'll be in it. If
[2:02:10] it happens tomorrow
[2:02:12] or a year or 10 years or whatever it is,
[2:02:15] we won't weary. I've only got a short
[2:02:17] life. You only got a short life. And
[2:02:19] it's just passing quickly past us
[2:02:29] in the midst. I'm closing now.
[2:02:32] in the message
[2:02:35] uh
[2:02:39] is the rising of the sun.
[2:02:42] Brother Brennan comes towards the end of
[2:02:43] that service
[2:02:46] and uh
[2:02:52] he says the quickening power. I believe
[2:02:55] we're probably got you know I started
[2:02:57] singing it. I'm not a singer but I just
[2:03:00] started singing the prophet's words.
[2:03:07] I just started singing them.
[2:03:11] And he said something like this.
[2:03:14] I wish I could sang it. Look what we've
[2:03:16] seen in this day.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; The quickening power has come to stay.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; I've just adjusted it a wee bit. To open
[2:03:26] up the seven to open up the seven seals.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; What was that? Jesus Christ reveals
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; not intelligence of a man. quickening
[2:03:37] power fulfilled God's plan.
[2:03:41] The quickening power made the world
[2:03:43] testify. It's the truth. They can't
[2:03:46] deny.
[2:03:47] The angel of the Lord was around in the
[2:03:49] pillar of fire. God's voice did sound.
[2:03:52] The world didn't know. What could it be?
[2:03:56] And we who just look this way.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; It's our Lord up there. You see,
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; the quickening power.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not here just to have church. I'm
[2:04:11] here I I am rejoicing.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The quickening power.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; And it was just after he spoke those
[2:04:20] words, my wife and I went to the
[2:04:23] baptismal tank.
[2:04:29] And there was only a few people. Sister
[2:04:31] Tammy Brown's Tammy Laroo, but she was a
[2:04:34] Brown then.
[2:04:36] Her mom and dad were there and my wife
[2:04:40] and I went to the tank. I had wanted to
[2:04:42] be baptized for quite a long time.
[2:04:45] Was kind of waiting on my wife.
[2:04:49] Sometimes we men have to have a little
[2:04:50] patience and wait on our wives.
[2:04:53] Sometimes wait,
[2:04:55] wives have to wait on our husbands,
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:04:59] But it was so wonderful to go together
[2:05:03] and she went to her room and I went to
[2:05:05] my room and I was baptized
[2:05:08] and there I've been preaching for years
[2:05:10] but now I went in the water and this is
[2:05:13] just what happened. This is just my
[2:05:14] testimony and I'm closing
[2:05:17] came up out of the water. Brother I
[2:05:18] think brother Collins baptized us.
[2:05:21] There only half a dozen people there.
[2:05:26] Everyone had dispersed
[2:05:29] and I went to room. It was quite dark. I
[2:05:31] don't even remember any light. There was
[2:05:32] just little light I think from the door
[2:05:34] being opened in the change room. It was
[2:05:36] quite large.
[2:05:38] And I walked in
[2:05:40] and a presence just settled over me.
[2:05:45] It was like I'm pleased.
[2:05:49] And I walked to the corner and I hung my
[2:05:51] head down be in the corner soaking wet
[2:05:55] of course
[2:05:57] and that presence I was totally melted
[2:06:01] least. It was the least thing I
[2:06:03] expected.
[2:06:06] But I just begin to melt in his presence
[2:06:10] and a voice spoke to me and said, "Your
[2:06:14] wife is experiencing exactly the same
[2:06:17] thing right now."
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; And I got out of the tank, Brother
[2:06:22] Chris. I mean, I got out of the room
[2:06:26] and my wife came and I said, "What did
[2:06:29] you experience?
[2:06:31] This is what happened to me." She said,
[2:06:33] ' That's exactly what happened to me.
[2:06:36] And I thought that was so nice.
[2:06:39] Just the Lord doing something special.
[2:06:42] And there we were on two two different
[2:06:44] rooms having exactly the same thing.
[2:06:48] Friends, Cloverdale Bible Way. If we
[2:06:51] should never meet this side again of the
[2:06:54] veil,
[2:06:55] this one I'm speaking about
[2:06:58] is present.
[2:07:00] I sense him even now.
[2:07:03] And he's wanted me to say these things
[2:07:05] to you.
[2:07:08] He's wanted me to reaffirm and emphasize
[2:07:11] to you that there's nothing important in
[2:07:14] your life, nothing as important as for
[2:07:17] you to see that what God uttered out of
[2:07:20] his vindicated prophet's mouth,
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; was to direct you to those exact
[2:07:26] scriptures
[2:07:27] that are being fulfilled.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm also going to announce to
[2:07:31] you that they'll be fulfilled even
[2:07:33] whether whether you're aware of it or
[2:07:35] not aware of it. Nothing can stop the
[2:07:38] program of God.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; And I want you to pray, Lord, let me be
[2:07:44] fully conscious of what's happening.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Let me be fully in tune.
[2:07:51] Let me be completely in harmony and
[2:07:53] walking
[2:07:55] right in the right in the uh time in
[2:07:59] time with the symphony. Is that your
[2:08:02] desire?
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; I know it is.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; We'll bow our heads.
[2:08:10] Father, we're not only bowing our heads,
[2:08:11] but we're bowing our hearts.
[2:08:15] And today Lord perhaps uh for me it's an
[2:08:19] unusual service.
[2:08:23] It's an unusual presence.
[2:08:27] And I am desirous. I'm so desiring Lord
[2:08:30] that this will be conveyed and that
[2:08:32] others I trust that all everyone
[2:08:37] can sense your
[2:08:39] divine nearness
[2:08:42] and you're wanting to vindicate to
[2:08:45] uh somebody
[2:08:48] you're wanting to come near to the path
[2:08:51] that they're walking in
[2:08:53] and tomorrow they're going to be
[2:08:55] conscious that something has happened
[2:08:57] something's different.
[2:08:59] Something's taking place in my life and
[2:09:01] it will be you your your nearness and
[2:09:05] you'll begin to draw begin to draw us
[2:09:07] Lord out from the atmosphere and the
[2:09:11] influence of this world and we have to
[2:09:14] be in it but we're not of it.
[2:09:16] There are those, Lord, who are workers
[2:09:20] and bus drivers
[2:09:23] and business people and they have all
[2:09:26] their duties. But I'm asking, oh God,
[2:09:30] and the mothers with their children,
[2:09:33] the singles, the young people,
[2:09:36] Father, you see, there is not one person
[2:09:39] outside of the scope of your vision. And
[2:09:42] I want I pray Lord that you will just
[2:09:47] superimpose upon their minds
[2:09:50] that that your words that you would not
[2:09:53] leave them at any moment. And if there
[2:09:56] was any time that Cleopus and his friend
[2:09:58] needed you, it was on this day when they
[2:10:01] were in the midst of this prophecy. Oh
[2:10:04] God, I pray that you'll make it just
[2:10:07] electrifying to us. I ask that you will
[2:10:10] take these words, Father, that have been
[2:10:12] spoken and things that are modern events
[2:10:15] made clear by the prophecy. May this
[2:10:18] prophecy become a reality. May lives be
[2:10:21] turned around. I pray, oh God, that
[2:10:24] there will be a a a change of the order
[2:10:27] of our of our importance, of our agenda,
[2:10:30] of our future, Lord, because it needs to
[2:10:34] be it needs to take place. It needs to
[2:10:36] happen, God. I pray that there be none
[2:10:39] of our natural fleshly desires that will
[2:10:42] override or distract us from these
[2:10:46] things that you have prepared for your
[2:10:49] children, your elect, your people. In
[2:10:51] the name of Jesus Christ, I ask it.
[2:10:54] Amen.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:06] 8:42 is be it unto me according to thy
[2:11:08] word.
[2:11:10] Let's just stand as we
[2:11:13] [Music]
[2:11:16] just sing the first this first verse
[2:11:23] to me
[2:11:26] according to your word. According
[2:11:33] to your promises,
[2:11:38] I can stand secure.
[2:11:44] Heart upon my heart,
[2:11:49] the truth that sets me free
[2:11:54] according to your word, oh Lord.
[2:12:00] Be it
[2:12:02] to me.
[2:12:05] Be it to me
[2:12:09] [Music]
[2:12:12] to
[2:12:16] according to your proises.
[2:12:22] I can say to you
[2:12:28] upon my heart
[2:12:32] the truth that sets me free.
[2:12:37] Glory to God.
[2:12:48] I would like to encourage you to take a
[2:12:52] step.
[2:12:53] [Music]
[2:12:55] Take a definite step.
[2:12:58] This morning,
[2:13:00] I would encourage you to make this
[2:13:01] Sunday,
[2:13:03] a post-resurrection Sunday, a very
[2:13:05] special Lord's Day.
[2:13:10] [Music]
[2:13:12] Oh,
[2:13:14] there's so much I would like to say.
[2:13:17] [Music]
[2:13:21] I listened to I listened to the prophet
[2:13:24] speak to the people.
[2:13:27] I just thought
[2:13:30] his second last service,
[2:13:34] just one more leadership to speak.
[2:13:39] And he has to speak the truth. And he
[2:13:41] speaks it so
[2:13:44] [Music]
[2:13:46] so direct.
[2:13:48] [Music]
[2:13:49] It seems so cutting
[2:13:51] and essentially he was saying you're so
[2:13:55] slow,
[2:13:57] oh fools, and slow of heart.
[2:14:00] But these people that he spoke to didn't
[2:14:03] have the response that these two men
[2:14:05] had.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Right? And these two men,
[2:14:10] he had just said these things and he
[2:14:13] exposed who he was and they didn't see
[2:14:16] it yet, but they came to their place.
[2:14:19] They came to their house. Oh, who knows
[2:14:22] what who knows what was on their agenda.
[2:14:24] Who knows what it was they had? Who
[2:14:26] knows what it was? A family, the
[2:14:27] children, whatever more. But they took a
[2:14:30] hold of him and they constrained him.
[2:14:33] They wouldn't let him go. And he made as
[2:14:36] though he was going to continue. He made
[2:14:39] as though he must continue. But they
[2:14:42] constrained him.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Come in.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; And they displayed
[2:14:48] a character. And brother Brandham says
[2:14:52] that's the only thing you'll take with
[2:14:53] you from this realm to another realm is
[2:14:56] your character. I trust you have enough
[2:14:59] character this morning to recognize this
[2:15:02] word was uttered for my sake.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; And I have come down the road a long
[2:15:08] ways. I am now going to constrain him.
[2:15:12] Uh for those of you that may feel
[2:15:15] there's a a tug, a pull. There's
[2:15:17] something that's happening. He's trying
[2:15:19] to say something to you. Don't leave it
[2:15:21] for another day.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; Lay hold of him
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; and constrain him. and pull him into
[2:15:28] your life.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Pull him into every affair of your life.
[2:15:32] Do you understand what I mean? Pull him
[2:15:34] into your work life. Pull him into your
[2:15:36] family life. Pull them into your
[2:15:38] business life. Pull them into your
[2:15:40] education. Pull them in and say, "Jesus,
[2:15:43] be the Lord of all.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Be the Lord of all. Take
[2:15:48] control of absolutely everything. I'm
[2:15:50] here as your brother. I'm here as your
[2:15:52] friend. I'm here. If you consider me
[2:15:54] your pastor, I'm saying to you, you'll
[2:15:56] never
[2:15:58] never regret it.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; This is our word.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; I have never found anyone that pull them
[2:16:06] in and said, "Lord, be the Lord of all.
[2:16:08] I'm taking definite steps. I'm going to
[2:16:11] constrain you."
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; This business that the church is always
[2:16:16] on there and God's always on his knees
[2:16:18] begging for you to come. That's a
[2:16:20] deception,
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; That's a falsehood.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; The scripture says that what the father
[2:16:25] has given me and no man can come to me
[2:16:27] except the father draw him. All I'm
[2:16:30] trying to do is encourage those of you
[2:16:32] because I know that the enemy,
[2:16:35] God's enemy, your enemy, my enemy. He
[2:16:39] would do everything this morning to make
[2:16:41] you leisurely,
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; to make you sluggish about the word that
[2:16:46] you've just heard, to procrastinate and
[2:16:48] put it off to another time. I say in the
[2:16:51] name of the Lord, do not put it off.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; You men that have families and homes,
[2:16:58] you say, "My home shall be different
[2:17:01] from this day forward because I'm in the
[2:17:04] midst of a prophecy.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; I'm in the midst of the coming of the
[2:17:08] Lord. I'm in the midst of the
[2:17:10] resurrection prophecy that's been given
[2:17:12] to us for this hour. It's not for
[2:17:14] generations up ahead. It's for us now."
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I'm not just preaching.
[2:17:21] I thought about this very deep before I
[2:17:23] came here.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; So much so
[2:17:28] that if this is for people 200 years up
[2:17:31] the road, then this was not the
[2:17:33] forerunner.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Then he wasn't the forerunner.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; If he wasn't the forerunner, he wasn't
[2:17:45] Elijah.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:49] Say what you wish to say.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; That's the conclusion I came to
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; so that I could come here with
[2:17:55] confidence and say this is the
[2:17:57] forerunner.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; This is Malachi 4.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the one introducing
[2:18:03] us to Jesus Christ.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; This is him.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; He has come.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; He has laid the word out.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; This is the sign of the Messiah.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; This is the sign of the resurrection.
[2:18:17] Do you really believe that?
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Then I want you to say within your
[2:18:21] heart, "My home will be different. My
[2:18:24] life will be different."
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how to close.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:18:38] [Music]

[2:21:01] you've not had.

[2:22:39] making us realize the
[2:22:43] the urgency of the hour, Lord, that we
[2:22:45] live in.
[2:22:47] Help
[2:22:48] each of us, Lord, to give you that
[2:22:51] place,
[2:22:53] that intimacy that you desire, Lord
[2:22:56] Jesus, as you go with us
[2:22:59] and draw us
[2:23:01] along the way as we travel with you,
[2:23:03] Lord, moment by moment and step by step,
[2:23:07] Father.
[2:23:11] Lord, we're so hungry and thirsty for
[2:23:14] you, Lord.
[2:23:16] We so need you, Jesus, at this hour, oh
[2:23:19] God.
[2:23:21] Help us, Father, that we may yield to
[2:23:24] you, Lord.

[2:23:30] the things and the cares of life,
[2:23:32] Father, our plans and our purposes,
[2:23:35] Father, are not or nothing, Lord. It's
[2:23:39] your plan and your purposes, Lord. As
[2:23:42] you draw us by your Holy Spirit, Lord,
[2:23:46] to that place, Father, as we yield to
[2:23:49] you, Lord, we surrender our minds, our
[2:23:52] thoughts, our plans, our purposes, our
[2:23:57] desires, Lord, that your desire and your
[2:24:00] plans and your purposes may become those
[2:24:04] that are preeminent in us. Lord help us
[2:24:07] Lord Jesus as we are weak in the natural
[2:24:11] Lord but by your spirit you will draw us
[2:24:14] to you Lord each one Father you will not
[2:24:17] lose a one Lord if the Lord is dealing
[2:24:21] with us and dealing with your heart now

[2:24:34] mind your thoughts thoughts, your

[2:24:39] is not of importance. It's this moment
[2:24:43] with him. Invite him. I invite you,
[2:24:46] Lord. Come, Lord Jesus. I grab you now
[2:24:50] and I hold you to my bosom and I say,
[2:24:54] Lord, without you, we can do nothing. We
[2:24:57] are nothing and we will go no place
[2:25:02] without you, Lord. Father, we thank you
[2:25:06] for our precious pastor, Lord, for his
[2:25:09] labor for the sheep, oh God, that you
[2:25:12] would bless and strengthen him, Lord.
[2:25:15] Allow your spirit, oh God, to energize
[2:25:18] and strengthen him, Father.
[2:25:21] and Father, this afternoon, Lord, that
[2:25:24] our conversation would be seasoned with
[2:25:26] grace and mercy, Lord, and that we would
[2:25:30] put you on our lips first place and
[2:25:33] every thought and everything, every
[2:25:36] conversation, Lord, everything that is
[2:25:39] important to us
[2:25:42] is here in your word, Lord.
[2:25:46] And you're the most important, Lord. We
[2:25:49] give you the preeminence today, Lord. Go
[2:25:52] with us, protect us, and bring us back
[2:25:55] this evening, Lord.
[2:25:58] If there'd be another time this evening,
[2:26:00] Lord, with you that we can draw near to
[2:26:03] you, Lord, let us draw near to you and
[2:26:05] stay close to your heart today.
[2:26:09] Lord, you've opened a door.
[2:26:12] You've knocked on our hearts and we've
[2:26:14] opened the door to you and you've drawn
[2:26:16] us to you. And Lord, we just yield now.
[2:26:21] We yield our mind, our heart, and our
[2:26:23] soul. We yield our family. And for me in
[2:26:27] my house, it will be different.
[2:26:29] I choose you, Lord, over everything.
[2:26:33] There's nothing in this life
[2:26:36] that can hold us because you have us. We
[2:26:40] are in you and you are in us.
[2:26:43] [Music]
[2:26:44] Thank you, Father, for the joy of
[2:26:48] knowing
[2:26:50] that you're here with us
[2:26:53] and you will never leave us nor forsake
[2:26:55] us.

[2:27:02] in that name that is above every name.
