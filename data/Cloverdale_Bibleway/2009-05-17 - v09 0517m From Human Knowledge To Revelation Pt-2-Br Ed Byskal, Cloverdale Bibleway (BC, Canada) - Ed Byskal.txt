Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I'm going to ask our brother John Andy's, brother John, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. We just have uh one request here this morning for Sister Audrey Bales in Idaho in the hospital. Very serious condition. Doctors don't expect her to make it. Want to pray for her this morning. Remember brother Tom as he's away this morning. Amen. And if you've got a need, you just hold it up before the Lord as we go before brother John. Heavenly Father, we just want to come humbly this morning into your presence. We come, Lord, just continuing in worship as your word has been so wonderful down through the ages. Even as our brother Rod read out of the scriptures, I believe our brother David would feel comfortable here this morning. The songs we've sang are expressing our own hearts back to you that our hope is in the Lord, our trust is in you, our confidence is in you. and we lift up our hands. We lift up our hearts, Lord, as your sons, as your daughters. You're raising a family. You're raising up a people. And you're a wonderful father. You've done well, Father, throughout the ages. And this morning, we just come with our hearts open. We just want to come into your gates with thanksgiving, into your courts with praise. We want the veil to drop behind us, Lord, with everything that's within us. We want to come into that holiest of holies, forgetting about everything around us. Who's here? Who's not here? What happened this past week? What might be going on in our own lives that Lord just needs to fall away and let all reasoning and doubts and questions and fears and mistakes and past failures just fall by the wayside. We're in the king's throne room. This is where the supernatural takes place. This is where Almighty God meets with his people. And we just want to come humbly, Lord, yet with the boldness as your sons and as your daughters that we can come as Queen Esther, Lord, that you've reached forward and touched, Lord, our lives. And that whatever we ask, whatever we would say, whatever we would believe, I believe is here for us, God. And we're with brothers and sisters that believe this message. God has been unveiled in our lives. And we recognize you, Lord. We just want to give you preeminence in our worship today. Forget about everything else and look to you, the lamb of God. There's needs, Lord. Hands are lifted up. Unspoken request. Unless you touch her, this lady in Idaho, Father, she may pass into that other dimension. Lord, we don't know the many needs that might be here. unspoken requests. But we serve a mighty God. And we want to confess that you are the healer. You are the healer, Lord, of our bodies, our minds, our spirits, our souls. You're the deliverer, God. I pray that you would go throughout this meeting and set the captives free, the bruised. Lord, that you would deal with their lives. May answers just come right out of your heart into brothers and sisters that are believing you, God. Lord, we just feel hungry this morning. We feel thirsty for your presence. And Lord, as you pass through this meeting, don't let us be as those in the past, stubborn and stiff necked and have missed you, God. The mighty God unveiled right before them and you just passed right by and they missed it. God, don't let this congregation, myself, anyone in this meeting or would hear this service be that type of person. But Lord, may we be real eagles. May we have eagle eyes and may we spread our wings and open up our ears to hear what the spirit would say to the church in these perilous times. We need the voice of God to be echoing in our hearts. And we believe we're at the right place, Lord. We believe we've come to this moment of time that all the secrets and all the mysteries, you're wanting to make them known to us. The mystery of your will, the mystery of your coming, the mystery of your presence, the mystery of who you are. So would you break the bread of life today. Use the minister, the man of God to speak to our souls as we're reaching into that place where all things are possible. May you just drop down the supernatural into lives that are waiting and hungry to see you. God, I pray this would be a special meeting. God, may this be an atmosphere that's charged with believing hearts. We believe you, Lord. And whatever you say to us, we say amen to that. So would you just have your way in this weekend, God, our one service. So let us already be under expectation. Bless the musicians, Lord, the songs, just every part of this service, Lord. Let the presence of God just come in a special way. Be with those that aren't among us, maybe traveling or away with their families. Be with them, Lord Jesus, and our visitors. May you just speak special to our hearts as we're just waiting, God. We're we're just quivering, Lord, as it was, just wanting to know what you would drop down into our lives. Strengthen us with a mighty hand, God. and go out and minister to your people today across the the nations of the land as we look for your coming and your appearing. I pray that revelation would be the bride's portion today. We love you, Jesus. We worship you, oh God, in spirit and in truth. We open up our hearts to you. Let there be a divine encounter today with you in Jesus name. Amen. And you can have your seats. Want to welcome everyone. Those who are visiting with us. We're happy to have you here. Um, Brother Gary and Sister Lisa St. John have a song for us this morning, I understand. And as they're coming, let's sing together. We are standing on holy ground. We are standing on holy ground.

[Music] Oh, how he loves you and me. He gave himself what Lord could he do. Oh, how he loves you. Oh, how he loves me. Oh, how he loves you and me. [Music] Why did he go to Calary? Why was his life's blood shed for me? Why did he suffer like no man has ever done? There's just one reason. I am the one. He loves me. He loves me. Jesus loves me. He loves me. He loves me. Jesus loves me where I'm sad. He loves me. Even when I'm bad, he still loves me. And when it seems no one cares for me, I talk to Jesus. He loves me. He loves me. He loves me. Jesus loves me.

[Laughter] [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm glad Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be turning to the word at this time. As we do, let's turn on the screen to number 1104. He loves us. Amen. He's with you everywhere you go. Even sometimes we don't sense his presence, he's always there. There is an unseen hand to me that leads in ways I cannot see while going through this This hand still leads me as I go. There is to the unseen hand that guide me through. This we [Music] s [Music] this hand has laid. [Music] through shadows free. And while he leaves, I have no fear. I know [Music] to [Music] where no sorrow can come I trusting the [Music] He guide us through this [Music] I reach the strength you guide by the unseen hand where I long to see [Music] my savior face and Sing the stories open sart [Music] that holy strength. Oh, I'm going to praise him. [Music] Trusting to the hand that God [Music] is free. [Music] something [Music] to guide [Music] the unseen. I'm trusting you to trusting to the I see him that God [Music] sweet [Music] by The unseen head where I'm trusting the unseen Yeah. Heat. [Music] It's sweet. I still [Music] amen. We're a privileged people to be able to have access to reach through and feel that there is a a very present one that's got a hold of our hand. Got a hold of more of our hand more than our hand, our life, &gt;&gt; our future. Amen. And he's uh conscious of all things. He's uh he's very very aware of where you're at right today and uh what your concerns are, what your needs are, what mine is. And I'm so thankful for that. A very present help in time of trouble. Uh we're going to be turning to the scripture right away because I have quite a number of uh readings that I'll have you read with me. I've prepared them so they could be on the screen so we can emphasize certain phrases, certain words. But uh we were uh we're saddened for the news we got uh just day before yesterday. Our brother Lineal Y was on a scaffold with his son or son-in-law and uh he was they were up 16 ft and the scaffold somehow collapsed and uh he fell. Brother Lennial uh cracked uh about six ribs and one of the ribs punctured a lung and then the lung collapsed. Uh so he's in need of our prayer today. And uh uh that's all we have heard. But we just are praying that God will raise them up because they uh the Leon brothers uh have all planned they've got their tickets and everything to be here with us for the family camp and we certainly want them to be here. So we think this is just uh you know we can only regard this as the enemy &gt;&gt; of God's program and we believe that God wanted them to be here along with their pastor brother Donnie Reagan for the family camp in August. So we're going to have prayer for brother Lennial and all it takes is one touch. I'll never forget I was with brother Billy Paul on one occasion. I I think he was just repeating what his dad said. Just one touch. Just one touch just from him &gt;&gt; that we just finished singing about the unseen hand. &gt;&gt; Now we want that unseen hand just to come and touch not only each of our lives but touch brother Lenal and anyone that we may have on our heart today. I'm sure if I ask for hands which I don't need to. I have people on my heart. I just will not get I whatever spirit is in me won't let them go. And I'm so glad for that spirit because it wouldn't let me go. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's our God. A very present God. He's just uh uh desiring to meet our faith and answer to our faith. Amen. We're needy people, folks. We're needy people. I said &gt;&gt; very needy people. and don't let the devil, you know, kind of uh veil us and blind us to the time that we're in. We have very real needs and we want to see God uh break through and answer and see the answer and so that his name will be glorified. That's our desire. So, if you would just stand and we're going to pray and I going to ask that we'll sing first. All that I have, all that I am, all that I am, all that I am, all I shall ever be. I love I [Applause] surrender to thee. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing it once again. Think of every word now. [Music] &gt;&gt; All that I have. All that I am, all I ever shall ever be. Oh God, you must know the I surrender to thee. &gt;&gt; That is what is in our hearts. Dear Lord Jesus, I surrender all to thee. Oh, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob. You're the object they worshiped and we worship you. Years of time and the span of time separates us from them, but it is not separated from you because you are eternal. &gt;&gt; And the day that they worshiped you is as as a few moments ago. And here we are. are the spiritual seed of Abraham. Believing with the faith of our father Abraham, believing that we have received, oh God, that very same spirit, Elohim has manifested himself to show that he's alive. He is not dead. He's not in the grave. not alive just merely yesterday or years ago, but alive presently, waiting to hear our prayer and waiting to answer it. And I pray, oh God, that you will flood over this congregation today, Lord, that you'll reach deep with that unseen hand down into the very realm of the soul. Oh Lord, we're not interested in having just the flesh uh enthused. We're not interested just having the spirit inspired. We want, oh God, that the word of God will come down that channel of faith into the soul. And by hearing the word, we'll receive the faith that's necessary and essential for today's life and today's walk. Grant it, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ. We're praying for brother Lenol y. Lord, let the unseen hand reach through to the room and to the bed, wherever he might be at this time in the name of Jesus Christ. Raise him up as you have raised others up that are sitting here with us today. Some are not here because they're afflicted or sickened. I pray, oh God, you'll rebuke the enemy on our behalf and drive him far from the camp. And may the people be healed by the master, our great physician, our Lord Jesus Christ, that you'll be glorified. And now anoint us, Lord. We need that anointed word, not the wisdom of man, not some fine presentation, but I pray that it'll be the Holy Ghost that will take the word and deliver it to every heart, Lord. And may we be uh may we be stirred by that word in the name of Jesus Christ. We can say with a songwriter, my heart is stirred whenever I think of Jesus. Oh Lord, how blessed and how wonderful and how lovely you are. Come, I pray. And just your presence, Lord, with us will just be sufficient for us because we know where your presence is. The supernatural is happening. We give ourselves to you now completely. Anoint myself, Father, and the hearers. Anoint all who are streaming into their room, into their hearts. Oh God, bless them. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Well, I trust that you've had a good time as you've been uh reading and absorbing the unveiling of God. I know many of you have and been getting the books printed and that's wonderful. Amen. I'd like to read in Philippians. Second chapter and I have this on the screen as well. All right. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. I want to read also in second Corinthians uh the third chapter in verse 18. For those of you that don't have the Bible, we have it on the screen as well. But we all with open face, beholding as in the in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord. And because it starts out by but we all I think that we all should read that together. But we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord. Amen. You may be seated. These first first verses we read out of Philippians really in my mind I just jotted down. It seems like it's the personification of contrast because it says who being in the form of God and you can't really get any higher than that. who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant. So, the form of God to the form of a servant is uh is about as far apart as you can get because one is the the supreme being, the creator. We have all kinds of terms uh of God. We can't begin to grasp him. The prophet said if we try to try to determine he how can you describe God that fills all time and space. God who has uh been forever. He's eternal. No beginning. Our minds fail us right there. And no end. Our minds fail us again. We can't grasp that. But nevertheless, we do believe that this great they call a great deity or this eternal one or whatever kind of people from all over uh the lands and around the globe and for all the centuries have tried to uh you know get some definition of God. But that's why God said to Moses that you will make no image. you'll make nothing to to appear like unto me because there is no fixed image of God. And God made himself a servant and in that form he began to make himself known. It wasn't just that he came in the flesh as it speaks of in John's gospel in the word which was the logos that went out from God. that word and even these even these few words are are beyond our capacity to how do we determine and how can we visualize that that word came down and materialized in a person called Jesus Christ and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and yet it was this you can see that John is with that uh he had that uh uh prophetic. He had the spirit of the eagle. He was a prophet. He was a prophet apostle in that sense. And as as we know, Matthew had one. Matthew and Luke and and Matthew, Luke, Mark, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And John, he's starting off different. In the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory. Well, there was multitudes and multitudes of people that beheld him but they didn't behold his glory. So John is seeing something and I want to continue on from last Sunday which is from human knowledge to revelation. So John is going beyond human knowledge when he writes this &gt;&gt; goes beyond our human knowledge. We can't grasp even these words but he's speaking them by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Spirit is the author of this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the and and they saw his glory and beheld it. And then the Apostle Paul also says as we read, "And we are we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord." So we're to behold something. We're to behold something of his glory. We're not just churchgoers, &gt;&gt; but we're to behold something. We're to see something. And by seeing it, it is to it's to have an effect on us and to have a a transforming effect. It changes us. And then from glory to glory or from revelation to revelation as Moses said to God uh he he wanted to see God and God said no man has seen my face but he said I'll put you in the cliff of the rock as I pass by. Moses said let me see your glory. He wanted to see his glory. And when he used that then God answered back no one has seen my face. Because he knew what Moses was asking. I want to see you face to face. That was reserved for an end time generation. We were to see him face to face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In other words, in all of his glory. But often, as it has been always, we don't perhaps recognize, and I want to stress that because I want to be speaking partly on that, recognizing uh he who's amongst us at this time. It's always been uh I think a a very sad and serious mistake that people have made all down through history. And you find that they scarcely ever recognize God in their time. &gt;&gt; They have God of expectation and God of the past. But I don't know what's wrong with us humans. We seem to fail to see and recognize actually recognize. And I'll be going into that word of recognition to recognize who he is right at this time at this moment. And I say that with a w with a great deal of feeling because I for one who was eyewitness to some of the uh ministry of the prophet of God. I for one have regretted so much. I said, "Why didn't I have a tape recorder going? Why didn't I have a camera going all time? Why didn't I record? You know why? Because I was too slow. I didn't recognize. People often say, "Well, when did you recognize it?" I don't know if we ever actually recognized to the full capacity what it was. And not only what it was, and you might say, "Oh, brother Ed, how could you miss such an opportunity?" Well, I'll just I have news for you. You're missing it right now &gt;&gt; because you're the same God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same God that was back there. &gt;&gt; Same God that was 40 years ago. The same God that was 2,000 years ago in Jesus Christ. They missed it in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They missed it in the Apostle Paul. Can you imagine if we if I could say, "Well, we're having a a a a rare meeting this morning. We have the Apostle Paul here to speak." But the same Apostle Paul said, "Have I become your enemy because I've told you the truth?" &gt;&gt; So they were not recognizing. Do you think that they jumped all around and danced and said, "Praise God, we've got the first church age messenger around us." No, they didn't even know it. &gt;&gt; That was perhaps reserved for a different time. But it's always it always has been and I suppose it always will be that we don't recognize uh we don't recognize who it is that's amongst us. And the other thing is we find this also in the world the the recognition of famous people most of it is after they're dead. &gt;&gt; That's when the recognition is artists for example artists I know famous artists and they were long gone. They get famous usually after they pass away and then their works become more valuable. People say well when did he die? you know, well, he or she they died, you know, in the last century or they died in the 1800s and and their works become more and more valuable. Of course, people, you know, they see something in their art and and they critique their art and so on and so forth. or there's other people and they have they've contributed some marvelous things to the world and to the people but their recognition mostly for the most part not always but for the most part is after they're gone. Isn't that not so? &gt;&gt; And spiritually it's exactly the same that recognition is after uh a person is gone. Now we've just read that the uh that he was in the form of God and he thought robbery to be equal with God but he made himself a no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant. It's the fact that he became as the form in the form of a servant is what made it almost almost impossible to recognize who he was. But I say almost because that is where the human understanding and knowledge ceases. And as I said last Sunday in this chasm between human understanding and revelation, you know, we've you've often heard and we've confessed and we've preached that Christ is in us. Now, uh Christ is in his bride. I can use the quotes and if it remains a quote, it just won't mean anything to us. And I'm here this morning. I'm preaching it myself because I've been praying all through these studies. God, make it make it so real to me. Make your presence so real. Not a presence that I can feel just that's not it. but cause me to know somehow within the deep recesses of my being that you are present and I have a communication with you and I can speak and I will speak correctly and you will hear and I can ask and you will act. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God &gt;&gt; we need. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God we have. But it may be the very God we don't recognize as being that. So I say almost because by revelation by the Holy Spirit pierces even through and beyond human knowledge. That's why the apostle John when he could say whom our hands have handled &gt;&gt; and our eyes have beheld him but they knew who he was not for a future season or from the past but at that moment &gt;&gt; and I think of our church services it is it is such a uh if it's such a subtle thing we come to church and we feel like we've kind of done our duty you know every church has its own tradition whether it be the confessional or the catechism of the Catholic Church or or some other uh you know statements and everybody has their phraseology or their certain phrases that they quote and we have ours. That's not sufficient. &gt;&gt; It's not sufficient for you to say, you know, Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, that's all fine and wonderful. That's not enough. &gt;&gt; It has to be a a a revelation of those scriptures that this is here now. We're not even talking about last Sunday. We're talking about this Sunday. We're talking about this Lord's day. And we need to have that on an ongoing basis. When you go to your work tomorrow or you go shopping or you go to the office, you need to have a a a you you need to have more than a a knowledge or an understanding. You you need to ponder these things until it's a reality with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to preach or we won't get all to these what everything I want to say. So in a mighty the mighty God unveiled before us, brother Bram says God always veils himself from the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; But he he he he veils himself. I'm sorry. He always veils himself from the unbeliever. But he always unveils himself to the believer. In the message identification, Brother Bram said, "I've been preaching these strong messages about his coming and trying to lay out the possibilities and the hour that we're now living in and how that everything to my opinion, this is 1963, everything to my opinion and my humble opinion is just in is just in condition for the coming of the Lord. the rapture, the the next thing and all that lacks could happen within an hour. He said, "I believe uh I believe of many. I don't know just how many, but several of the outstanding prophecies pertaining to the fulfillment of the coming of the Messiah and what he would do was fulfilled in the last seven hours at the cross." &gt;&gt; Amen. all of those prophecies. He says now that could happen that could happen the same way &gt;&gt; at his return and we must be alert and waiting. &gt;&gt; So we don't want to be putting things off into some future time that this needs to happen or that needs to happen because I think the best thing for us to do is as far as the future's concerned is to say we don't really know what the future is. We're human mortals and our minds run out of space. We don't know what the future is. But we know one thing that everything and I'm absolutely confident this almighty God has everything unfolding precisely in its time. &gt;&gt; Nothing's out of line. Nothing's off track. Nothing is too late. And nothing is too early with God. It may appear that way to us, but in as far as God is concerned, everything is exactly on target. &gt;&gt; And that's my confidence, and I'm I believe that is yours as well. &gt;&gt; In the same ver in the same message, the mighty God unveiled. That's not the unveiling of God now. It's the mighty God unveiled. He said, "God has a very odd way of dealing with people. He hides himself from the unbeliever and reveals himself to the believer. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; He unve He hides himself from the unbeliever and reveals himself to the believer. So the unbeliever can have a can have a great knowledge perhaps even a greater knowledge than we have. In theologically speaking, there's multitudes that know infinitely more than perhaps we do of the history and can place it all and the timelines and the lineage of the kings and the lineage of the prophets and can put the things together and when Israel was divided into the into two uh under Judah and Israel and and they have all the kings and so on down. I look into it every once in a while when it is pertinent to maybe something I'm studying. And I I marvel at their books. I've got a a series of volumes of uh of of the international uh encyclopedia Bible Bible books. And and and I just marvel. I look and say, "How did these men put all these words together?" Just big thick volumes like this and a whole series. I just can't imagine where it all come from. And I I have an admiration for men that got that kind of capacity to put that together, to assemble it, and to even put it down. And and I appreciate that. But I can tell you one thing, one one just one spurt &gt;&gt; of revelation is more than all of those volumes. &gt;&gt; I give me a simple man that knows God, got a hold of God. I remember one meeting I was at and there was a great big tall raw boned old man and uh he had been a he'd been a minister years ago and I don't know how old he was but I think he's probably in his 80s and there was a little Spanish brother and he was backsliding had been away from God and uh alder was full of people and this great big raw bony looked like he might have been a farmer armor and he came down and he knelt he knelt beside this Spanish man and I I knelt beside him as well and we were both praying for him and I prayed. I was just young in my early ministry and I I I was I didn't know what more to say. I I thought I'd prayed, you know, I shot the wad like they say. I said all the words I knew to say and I prayed for him and believed for him and and nothing was happening. just nothing was happening, no response. And uh this old man, he just nailed behind him and he towered over him as he knelt and he had his hand on his back. He said, "Break him, Lord. Break him. &gt;&gt; Break him, Lord. Break him." You think that was done? No, he didn't shoot his wad. Break him, Lord. Break him. He knows all about it. Break him. Break him. And it wasn't it was a few minutes. I just wondered when he was going to get done praying. He just stayed right on the line. He knew that's exactly what need to happen. And pretty soon that man just cracked. &gt;&gt; He prayed until God came on the scene. &gt;&gt; And what did God do? Broke him. &gt;&gt; Exactly what the old man was praying. I never forgot that. I thought, "Wow, that works. That actually works." &gt;&gt; What did he do? He got in the channel of what that man needed and he just stayed with it. And I appreciated that old man, old servant of God. So now I'd like to say it's absolutely essential that a believer experiences revelation by the Holy Spirit of God. That's absolutely essential. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm sure that we all feel that we have entered in and we have received revelation. And I believe that otherwise we wouldn't be here. But what we had in the past or what you had when you came to the knowledge of Christ and you gave your life to Christ, you uh certainly I can say with some confidence that there's certainly more for us today. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying that this is not an optional thing. Revelation is not optional. It's essential. &gt;&gt; Absolutely essential. It's absolutely necessary. &gt;&gt; It's not necessary as something you experienced years ago. It's necessary today, &gt;&gt; this very day in 209. And so the revelation that Peter had, which we referred to last week, the the revelation that he had, thou art the Christ, thou thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. and to have Jesus respond, "Blessed art thou, Peter s Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven." So revelation is coming from the father which is in heaven. I'm speaking about revelation, not revelation of the message. &gt;&gt; The revelation I'm zeroing in on this morning is the revelation of where we are in the message. where you are, where I am today, &gt;&gt; folks. Last week, I can't do very much about it. Neither can you. Last week has gone into history. Last week's acts, last week's thoughts, last week's works, that's gone. &gt;&gt; But here we are now. We've got this moment. &gt;&gt; We've got this time. Shall we seize it? &gt;&gt; Is there something more that can be done? I'm going to read a quote for you that you've read many times. Brother Brandham said that if we uh something to the effect if we not exercised faith, but if we could believe &gt;&gt; the kind of faith that he was talking about, he said, and we should take this very very seriously. He said there wouldn't be one feeble one amongst us in the next five minutes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we get quiet, but that's really what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about I'm not I'm not I'm not happy to simply read what Brother Brandham did, how he called out people, all that. That God is present here now. &gt;&gt; I'm not him. You're not him. But that God is greater than all of us. that God is prepared to even take his word or to take a a a vessel such as myself attempting to stay on track and to say what he wants. I've given myself to him. Now I have to trust him and you have to trust that it is him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have to recognize whether it be uh within yourself or within uh your associate or your family member or whatever more we have to come to a divine revelation that Christ is in his bride that it's the same God. &gt;&gt; And if we could recognize that that's the faith &gt;&gt; that's the belief that would see that there isn't a feeble one amongst us in five minutes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just come to a human excitement. &gt;&gt; I don't want a human spirit. I don't want my spirit to get enthused and pass that off to you. This is not enthusiasm that you need. It's faith that you need. &gt;&gt; And we just need to keep keep uh speaking the word, speaking the word. Confess the promise. Say it is mine. It is mine. And to keep saying it until you believe it. That is why it is so uh such a tactic of the enemy to you know cause whatever kind of distraction or to place something in our minds that this brother this sister that happened this you need we need to forget that completely &gt;&gt; because those are hindrances &gt;&gt; and we need to move those hindrances out. &gt;&gt; If you have any affection for the world or love for the world move that hindrance out. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to bring you to a place of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need a supernatural hand of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to continue to preach that this morning &gt;&gt; long and hard if I need to because we do not need a God of the future. We do not need a God of the past. We need a God of the now. This moment now. &gt;&gt; We need him on hand. We need to see things so that also he will receive glory from it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's some wonderful things I could tell you about over the pulpit today. I wouldn't dare because somebody somewhere will get a hold of it and and then it gets into man's hands and they start manhandling something. But where the message is going and the lives that are being touched, it's just so wonderful. I can't even give it to you over the pull pit because every once in a while, you know, somebody gets, "Oh, I heard you say that." And right away they get it down in some emotional realm. They want to go in and they want to do things. I say, "Forget it. &gt;&gt; Just forget it. If God wanted you to do things, he'd open it up to you." &gt;&gt; When God opens a door to us and we just start moving through it. We don't announce everything to the world. &gt;&gt; We don't announce it to everybody. We announce what we can and we rejoice in what we can. And sometimes you have to just be very very quiet and backward and almost secretive about it. But I can tell you God's on the move. Not yesterday, but now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's doing things right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the only reason I'm here behind this pulpit. I'm not interested in a God of yester year. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in a God of when Bible way was formed and whatever more. I'm interested in a God that's moving on the scene at this time, convicting lives, transforming us into the image. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so that revelation in the message Queen, Brother Bram says, now we find out that there was three classes of people. We spring from the sons of Noah, Ham, Sham, and Japheth. He says there was Jew, Gentile and Samaritan. He said, "And if you notice, Peter by revelation was given the keys of the kingdom because God knew that he had the revelation of the scripture." &gt;&gt; He didn't Jesus didn't say who God was or who do you say who does man say that you know God was. He said who do they say I am? &gt;&gt; He's bringing it right to that very moment. He didn't want to hear what the what the Pharisees had said a couple weeks ago. He wanted to know what are they saying right now? Who do the people say that I am? You're some say you're Elias or a prophet or said they were Moses. But he says, "But I'm asking you, who do you say I am?" Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." And Jesus said, "Blessed art thou uh Simon Barjonah, son of Jonas." He said, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven." He said, "It's a revelation and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it." Amen. &gt;&gt; I know as believers and I know from mingling with the people that there are times when we feel that the that that Satan has invaded your territory, has invaded your inheritance, has invaded. I tell you friends, it's time for the believer to rise up and say, "I'm going to drive you out. &gt;&gt; You have no right. As of this moment, you hold no right. This has been my possession given to me by the very blood of God through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit which has been sent upon the church. And I take the message that God sent through a messenger that this Christ now is veiled in my flesh and I I disallow you. &gt;&gt; I invalidate your invasion. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said it was a direct revelation that had been made known to the apostle and that he was the son of God. He said, "And if the church still exists," &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the church still exists, then those in the church has come in there by spiritual revelation because that's how we come into the church. Does the church still exist? Is the body of Christ still existing? He said, "If it exists, then that's how it came in." &gt;&gt; It came in by the same spirit that revealed it to Peter is the same spirit that revealed it to you and to me. If the church exists and I say, "Yes, the church exists. &gt;&gt; Yes, the body of Christ is here. Yes, she is formed up into a bride body of Jesus Christ. And you and I must declare with fervent belief and faith, I am one of them. &gt;&gt; I am one of the few. I I don't care what others do, but I'm one of the few. &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here today. Not because I was here last Sunday, but because this God that I serve is is alive and in my life now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't go back. Don't let your mind go back and digest the circumstances. &gt;&gt; You've got to look forward at from this moment forward. &gt;&gt; In the works of faith expressed, he said, "No man can understand who he is or how it is except it be revealed to you by the revelation of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. And then faith in that you act accordingly. &gt;&gt; No one listen very closely. No man can understand. So our understanding our knowledge comes to an end. No man can understand who he is or how it is except it be revealed to you by the revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then faith in that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will act accordingly. &gt;&gt; I can tell you friends what I have in my heart today has zero allowance for any up down in out. I'm on I'm on fire. I'm cold. I'm backslid. It has no allowance for that. I I believe that when a believer is born of the spirit of God, no more than you can change your identity and your from your lineage. No more than you can change who your mother and father is. And that's human. &gt;&gt; You cannot change when you become a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a finished work. &gt;&gt; A finished work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The wise men. I thought of them. The wise men, the three wise men that came uh seeing the star and I have put down here. They saw far beyond the child that came to say &gt;&gt; far beyond a child. And you know that there's nothing more said about these wise men. &gt;&gt; They left. They had their exchange of words with the with with the with the king. And they said, "Where is he that is born king of the Jews? &gt;&gt; We've seen his star. We've seen this sign." And something within them told them, "The King of Israel, the King of Kings has been born." &gt;&gt; That's a revelation. &gt;&gt; And they came to the place where he was. And he must have, he was now, he wasn't in a manger, wasn't in the manger. He was a young child. And they came to where the child was. And And now here's three wise men that have traveled and journeyed far. And they've come, these are intellect, intellectual men, and they fall down and worship this child. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were looking far beyond the child, far beyond Mary. I don't know what they saw, but they knew that here he was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we've got to look far. They looked far beyond Mary, far beyond Joseph, far beyond the child, far beyond the environment and the circumstances. This is him. &gt;&gt; And they got up and left with that revelation. And there's no more record of them in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Whatever they saw, we need to see that and more. &gt;&gt; The prophet said that the nations in the message, the world is falling apart. Amen. &gt;&gt; 63. He said, "The nations were looking for something, and each nation was looking for it, but they looked like they didn't want to accept what God sent them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were asking for a man, a Messiah that would stomp out the rest of the nations. And God gave them a baby. &gt;&gt; Asking for a general, and God, a baby. &gt;&gt; God knew what they had need of. He humiliated them. &gt;&gt; They needed to be humiliated. &gt;&gt; They wanted, you know, something to make their maybe their church big or their denomination big or their nation conquering or their nation powerful enough to throw off the shackles of Rome. &gt;&gt; But they need to be humiliated. &gt;&gt; And sometimes God even allows that. &gt;&gt; It says in God in in Matthew's gospel, "And when they were come into the house, They saw the young child. That's what they saw. That was the that was the the the boundaries of their knowing, their intelligence or their knowledge. They saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And worship him. &gt;&gt; What a strange sight. Oh, we think about it at Christmas. This isn't a Christmas story. This is a revelation story. &gt;&gt; They saw him and that was the end of their knowledge. But they saw way beyond him. &gt;&gt; When they saw the child, that's not what motivated them to fall down. When they saw the child, that's not what motivated them to give them the gift of gold, frankincense, and more. Mr. That wasn't what motivated them. It was what was inside. What they saw this child to be. We've seen his star. God has announced this from the heavens. We've been following this star all of this time. And here he is. &gt;&gt; Not here he was. &gt;&gt; And not here he will be, but here he is. &gt;&gt; It was the identification of that moment, the recognition of that moment. My brother, my sister, if there ever was a time that we needed this, I can say to everyone that will hear my voice today, this is what is so absolutely critical and necessary for this church, for believers of this message because it has been given to you to know who he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented him with gifts, golden, frankincense, and myrr. They identified who he was in the form of an infant. And the angel of the Lord, brother Brandham said, in the presence of God unrecognized. And the angel of the Lord could be right here tonight and maybe one person see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No one else. The light, the star that came over every observatory that the wise men followed and no observatory knows anything about it. No one else saw it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? No one saw it. And here are three men. See, God can reveal himself to a large group or he can reveal himself to one. But those wise men because he said, and you can take this personally, no one else saw it because it was for them to see. &gt;&gt; And that is where I want to bring you to as I move through this message. If you have seen it, it's it's not because you were just favored of God, but it was that God for the before the foundation of the world had a certain uh a a certain combination, a certain makeup of his body, what he would call the body of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ. I wouldn't want you to even use that word loosely or glibly this morning. God thought, pondered himself. He had all eternity. Who knows when this came if it could be pinpointed, but he saw a certain makeup. &gt;&gt; He saw a certain characteristic. He saw exactly what would be needed in May 209. &gt;&gt; He saw exactly what would be needed in the Pacific Northwest. He saw exactly what would be needed in uh in in China &gt;&gt; or in Russia &gt;&gt; or in the Ukraine &gt;&gt; or in the Congo or in Africa, any other part or in Tanzania. God knew exactly what would be needed on this time and he would reveal himself and that's all he can do. He makes it as clear as he can. He reveals himself as plainly as he can. And that's like the prophet of God. He's standing there. My wife listening to a service yesterday and she just so caught in it. And here I'm speaking this, she doesn't know what I'm preaching on, but she says, "Here's Brother Brandham, and there's there's a wheelchair and a and and someone else in a in a stretcher and someone else laying there. Three hopeless cases, and he calls them by name. And he calls the next one by name. And he calls the next one by name. And he just keeps dealing with them, praying, oh that they will come to believe it. And they couldn't recognize who it was that was calling their name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where did that wisdom come from? And if it came from eternity, then why is God giving it at that moment? &gt;&gt; Because God intended for them to rise up off of that car and out of that chair. &gt;&gt; That was their moment. Amen. &gt;&gt; And friends, we're not here just to sing some songs or to listen to some specials or to say I went to church for another Lord's day. That's not why we're here. We're here that we can recognize him and say, "What is it, Lord, that you would have me to do? What is it that you are asking of me?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This present &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; came in the form of a servant. When the Pharisees and scribes and preeminent of that day, they were not impressed with him or his associates. Jesus was the friend of publicans and sinners. And so often God allows things of the human knowledge to come into conflict with revelation. He allows it because revelation is greater &gt;&gt; than your thoughts, &gt;&gt; greater than your circumstances, &gt;&gt; greater than what Satan's trying to use today. Now, you know, Satan's very cunning. He's not trying to use just things of the future, things of the past, but he uses things that are right now. &gt;&gt; He uses the things you're engaged in right now. It says in the scripture, "And when the Pharisees saw it, Matthew 9:11, and they said to his disciples, why does your master eat with publicans and sinners?" In Luke's gospel says, "Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him." &gt;&gt; All the publicans and sinners. Republicans were known as as tax collectors and they were hated &gt;&gt; and despised of the people. And so these tax collectors and and they were known to be a greedy group and and uh uh they were quite cruel could be quite cruel. And so they were very much hated amongst the people. And here the righteous and the scribes and the Pharisees and the good living people. you know why does your why does your leader why is he around these kind of people and to them in their knowledge it was an obstacle &gt;&gt; but they came to hear him &gt;&gt; I won't go any further they probably probably could sense a degree of mercy a degree of understanding here's somebody that could actually perhaps love me as we heard the song But the same people, they garnished the tombs of the prophets. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'll be say it to you plainly. I don't want to be one to garnish brother Brandham's tomb. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be shine up just his ministry because it was more than brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; It was more than a man. &gt;&gt; It was the God that was in the man. The God that was veiled. So Jesus said, "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sephilers of the righteous and say, "If we had been in the days of our fathers," in other words, if we had been back there, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. They recognized their fathers killed the prophets. They said, "We wouldn't have done that." But here, while they're looking in the past and could get that in some kind of, you know, smok and mirror so they stood they would stand uh justified. Jesus said, "Wherefore you're witnesses unto yourselves that you're the children of them that killed the prophets." Because they were standing right there now in their day. So it's possible here as we see we can look in the past and somehow we don't associate ourselves with the unbelief of the past. But let's make sure we're not allowing any unbelief in our heart. Now, &gt;&gt; and unbelief would be to disregard his presence here at this moment. &gt;&gt; To allow something that Satan has reared up big before us that some condition, some situation, some relationship or something else and it looms up so big that you can't seem to pierce through. And God this morning is why I'm speaking. God by the Holy Spirit wants to pierce through that veil &gt;&gt; so that you can be believing for God on the scene at this time. What kind of a God? A God where all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul, he recognized something far greater than a bright light that blinded him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He identified that this presence had to be the presence of God, &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; who art thou? &gt;&gt; I tell you that God could come into your little world &gt;&gt; with such a shock and he can come so suddenly and I pray that even this morning it will reverberate right down to your bootstraps that it'll just shake your soul and shake your world. I'm I'm preaching for that purpose. I'm preaching as though this will be my last message. I'm preaching with all the all the strength that the Holy Spirit will give me. That God will shake your world, &gt;&gt; shake your whole environment, &gt;&gt; shake where you are in your spiritual walk with God. Till you realize there's something much more than what you have experienced. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not enough to believe in him of the of last week or of the past. But right as of this moment, say, "Why why are you preaching this way?" Because God God fully intends, God is prepared to do anything that we are able to believe for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. young man just walked out because he has sugar diabetes and has to have a a needle. I can tell you that God's greater than his sugar diabetes. &gt;&gt; God's greater &gt;&gt; than my little granddaughter as I saw her struggle. God's greater &gt;&gt; God's greater than that. &gt;&gt; And the kind of God that I'm speaking about today is a God that can that not only can, he wants to. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; He's present. to heal those things. Those are physical. What about emotional? What about spiritual needs? You don't need to go carrying on under some great weight of burden. Jesus is here to lift that load. He wants you to cast it off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Change my mind from these doubts and these fears and these anxieties and wash it from the human element. And let's go from knowledge over to revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Said when light the pillar of fire smoked Paul down on the road to Damascus, he said he recognized that he was in the presence of God. He says, "And that Hebrew would have never called any any other spirit Lord." Besides, he knew that that was the pillar of fire that led the people out of the wilderness. And he said, "Lord, who art thou?" &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm Jesus." &gt;&gt; And the unveiling of God now says, "He came as the son of man, the prophet. He had done exactly even that little woman in all of her sin &gt;&gt; there at the well. She recognized him &gt;&gt; and she said, "We know that when the Messiah is coming, which is the Christ, &gt;&gt; that's what he'll do, &gt;&gt; not what something I heard about or I read about or something that I think is off in the future." But she see I she was she was no doubt struggling. &gt;&gt; She's seeing what was being done and he just asked me and told me about my five husbands and the one I have is not this is you know this is what the Messiah is supposed to do. But she'd had questions. The Samaritans say in this mountain and the Jews say in this city and I don't know where to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's all this business about worship and what church and what shall I believe and all of these things? I'm in a state of confusion. &gt;&gt; I know that when the Messiah comes, he'll do this &gt;&gt; that you're doing. She was zeroing in to what had happened right now. And that's why she was ready for it when he said, "I'm he." &gt;&gt; I'm he. &gt;&gt; You need to hear that. &gt;&gt; You need to hear it this morning. I'm here. &gt;&gt; I'm in the middle of the situation. &gt;&gt; I'm in the middle of your spiritual walk. I'm in the middle of your circumstances. You don't have to look outside to some exterior. I'm here. Yeah. I'm here right here. Now, if &gt;&gt; you can believe that, &gt;&gt; I can tell you we can have all kinds of reports and I don't need to have them. But I'd love to hear and know that God stepped into your little domain &gt;&gt; and changed everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Put you into his will and into his calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "I know when the Messiah is coming, which is called the Christ, that's what he'll do." She recognized, he said, "Because she was a predestinated seed." &gt;&gt; And that's really another reason why I would like to see I'd like to see you experience. I would like to see you come &gt;&gt; to a place where you say, "You know why? I know he's real. I talked to him this morning &gt;&gt; and he talked back to me. &gt;&gt; You know why I know he's real? &gt;&gt; I had something that was a great great need and I asked him and I spoke to him and he spoke back and he answered my desire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you can say, "I know I'm a predestinated seed." Cuz that's what happens to the predestinated seed. He said, "Where the rest of them didn't recognize it," he said they had nothing to recognize with. Amen. &gt;&gt; The definition of recognizing is to accept someone to be what is claimed. That's enough. There's a lot more to the definition. But the definition of recognizing that is to accept someone to be what is claimed, what they've claimed to be, or accept his power or his authority. Hallelujah. I already made mention, I'll just drop it in here. one of the one of the things that Jesus really stressed and that is the recognition after you know what it's not going to do this church any good not going to do you any good you know there's a lot of people here who have had you've experienced the loss of a loved one and I think about this all the time because I ask for give me something of the person's life so we could put together a eulogy. A eulogy even the word in the Greek is to praise to to exalt or give a person praise. I've never had anybody never had anybody in all my years give me a eulogy or give me notes for a eulogy with all the weaknesses and the frailties and the bad things that this person did. &gt;&gt; Never had it once. never had once them to say, "Well, this person was born in such and such a date and born in such and such a city and got married and married to this woman." It's but he was a poor provider, he drank, he couldn't keep a job or she was a poor mother and whatever more. They were poor neighbors and this person was just uh lived on unemployment insurance and was a someone living off the state. No, regardless of how bad the person may have lived, they eulogize them and the eulogy for life gone. And how many times I have heard, "Oh, I only I didn't realize &gt;&gt; what I had." &gt;&gt; I didn't realize &gt;&gt; what we had. I was in this city here when I got a phone call from a a friend of mine says, "I was just in church tonight. I was here for a wedding and I I got a phone call says, "I was in church tonight and they announced and requested prayer for brother Brandham because he's been in a car accident." Well, my world was starting to come apart and you know how bad, where, whatever. Well, it was a serious accident. So, I flew the next morning back home to Toronto. Got on the phone right away and I spoke to Tammy Tammy Laroo's dad. Brother Tom, I knew that Brother Tom Brown was close. I didn't want to call Brother Perry Green. There was such a flurry of things and I said, "Brother, Brother Tom, I would appreciate if you could keep me a breast and just let me know how things are happening. If you'd asked anybody in the message, anybody, anybody, is it God's will to take him? We would have said, "No way. He's a young man. He's got messages. We're ready to go back down. We want to go down and hear them." There's other people that got invitations from all over the country. And that simply tells me there's not one person And I and and it's not enough for us to look back there and say well uh that you know that was back there and those people they shouldn't have done that or those people they should have you know no we want to bring it forward. &gt;&gt; If we were in the same situation we'd say in no way is this to happen &gt;&gt; which would mean none of us know the perfect will of God. That's the God I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Just in case we get lifted up and think that we're tuned in and we got some special channeling, we know there are times when the natural and the affection and the emotional overwhelms us and we're not prepared to let people go and we're not prepared. And then we think, well, you know, but that's all after the fact. But where are we now? &gt;&gt; I can tell you that the gospel of this message would not have gone where it's gone. We'd all just been gathering around him and hearing one of the next services. And that isn't God was saying, "No, we've arrived at a different time. &gt;&gt; We've arrived at a time now where this word which I've already sent needs to go out." &gt;&gt; Yeah. It needs to have men going around the country. And so men started going all over the place saying, you know, this is what's happened. And God sent a prophet and he's here and he's gone. &gt;&gt; Well, you're gonna have to help me. &gt;&gt; If you read the church age book, you'll find where brother Brandham has put in the church age book. And of course, brother Lee Vale was assisting putting this book together. And the wording is the Thotyron church age, the Pergamian church age. And it says Christ eulogizes the church. Thotirin church age the eulogy. And here he eulogizes the church not after they've come and gone. Before they've arrived. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And before they arrived, he says, I know thy works &gt;&gt; and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is. &gt;&gt; And thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipus was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth. So here's this little infant church. They haven't had a chance to have a a record yet. This the church is just it in its early early stages to the thyron church age. He says, "I know thy works and love and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last not to be more than the first." That's what God is actually eulogizing the church. He says of the Sardisian church, "Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments, and thou shalt walk with me in white, for they are worthy." Not for those that had had been, but these were still many of them. Most of them were yet to come. &gt;&gt; And the Philadelphiaian church, I'm sorry to say, but it's the truth. There was no eulogy for the Leodysian church. &gt;&gt; Your age, my age, God didn't have anything good to say about it. That's something to ponder. But to the last age of prior to Leodysian, he said to the Philadelphiaian church, "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth." What a comfort that must have been for them. But now, as I you certainly caught last Sunday, I'm sure I have a great deal of apprehension about uh what we are really recognizing within the message. And I have a a great deal of caution lest we we do not want to become merely a recognized uh body of people known as a church. We It's much more than church. We've got to see far beyond church. We have to see far beyond the people that come to the church. We need to see far beyond each other. And this is I'll just say it plainly, brother Brandham. Now we're going to go into God being veiled and how it was so difficult and people missed him because of this veil and missed him because of this veil. They missed him. He was veiled in a pillar of fire. He was veiled in a whirlwind. He was veiled in in the prophets. He was veiled in Moses. Moses was a veiled. He was veiled. There was a veil and and the and the holy presence of God was over the mercy seat and he was veiled there and only the high priest could go. He was constantly veiled and brother Brandham is going through that working through it all the way bringing it down and showing how he was veiled in Jesus Christ. And he keeps bringing the parallel between then and now Matthew between Malachi 3 and Malachi 4. Between his life on earth and Luke 17:30 his revealing he he goes back and forth. That's what it was there. This is what it is now. That's what it was there. That's what it is now. Then he simply comes down and says now he's veiled in you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that I have trouble with that, brother Ed. You Yeah, I do. Because I see people are just so human. So, and and if you just accept him that well, how are you? You know, and God bless you and so on and so forth. Then I wonder what what posture should I be taking if I really believe and recognize that the same God that was in Christ Jesus is here now in his people, in his bride, in his people, in my brothers and in my sisters. How should I be conducting myself around them? &gt;&gt; Hey folks, this goes a million light years beyond just seeing you as a congregation or you seeing me as a minister. I'm brother Ed to you. You know, one day you may be gone and we won't know what we missed. I went to a church once and there was a man called brother Barry, a little Pentecostal church long before the message came and he sat right about here on the second or first seat. And he ne I never heard him say a word, brother Ernie. He never sang a song. He never gave a testimony. He never read a scripture. He never opened his mouth or uttered anything that I ever heard. I was 14. But every service he was right there. Every service at the same spot. And one day he passed away and was gone. That whole church must may have been empty. That old church may well have been empty or must or could have been empty because with that his presence gone, vanished. It was like a huge hole in the church. &gt;&gt; He was he wasn't close to the young people. He wasn't visible, but he just filled a place with his faithfulness and his faithfulness. And suddenly that faithfulness was gone. Everything he resembled, everything that he he everything that his life spoke of was gone. Not just his physical being, but and I never forgot that. Here I am 74, I was 14. That's 60 years ago. I never forgot never forgot his name. Brother Barry. I can't give you the names of anyone else that was around there. But when he was gone, say we didn't know what we had. We had someone faithful. We had someone's stalwart. We had a a praying saint of God. Can I take a few moments &gt;&gt; with some slides? Is there service this afternoon, Seattle? There is. Not that I'll keep you till three, but And so now this is in the unveiling of God. Brother Bram starts now my subject this morning. I trust that God will reveal this. And each time if you who take the tapes and listen and I hope and trust that you will have had a spiritual understanding of what that God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out. See, that's that's the little bit of mysterious part. That's what takes revelation when it's not said right out. Because if it's just said right out, then your mind takes it, digests it, okay, I know what he means, etc., etc. That's human knowledge. But when he says without saying it right out, he said it's a thing. Sometime we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down, it might bring some to go out, some to leave, and some to ponder. And I embolded that and underlined it because I believe that's what pertains to us. And I trust that these last Sunday, this service also will be one that causes us to ponder. But he said, "But that's done purposely and it must be done that way." He said, "We have to say things in such a way that it might thin down. It might bring some to go out and some to leave and some to ponder over." &gt;&gt; But that's done purposely. It might be done. It must be done that way. &gt;&gt; So there's an element within the message and it must be there. And that element is it's done to to to say it in such a way without saying it just so your mind grasp it and say yeah I understand that because you just understand human language but it has to go beyond that. And and then he said asked the question, you mean God would purposely do a thing like that? He certainly did &gt;&gt; and he does yet. &gt;&gt; So if we were to go back in that quote, we could say all of those things that he did, he did and he does yet. That brings it right to this present time. And he said one day when he had thousands around him, he said, "Except you eat of the flesh of the son of God uh son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." And the whole audience walked away from him. So now he said that one day and the whole audience walked away from him and there was a ministerial association with him. That was the 70 that he had called of 70 that had been chosen. And he turned to them and he said, "What will you think when you see the son of man ascend up where he came from?" Now Jesus all knowing he knew what the effect of those words would have on those people. &gt;&gt; And now he's saying, "Well, what will you think?" The 4,988 they left, you know, or and the 70 was included. So he says, "But now what will you think if you see the son of man ascend up for?" He says, "What? And if you shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before I gave the scriptural reference to it in in John 6:62." And he didn't explain that. &gt;&gt; He never explained how. &gt;&gt; Paul did that later on. He just said it. &gt;&gt; And he just said it. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are things that we don't know or don't fully understand the scope of in the message. We don't have to understand it. &gt;&gt; He just said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you prepared just to accept it? &gt;&gt; You'll be in you'll have the benefit. He says, "And no doubt them men said now just a moment. We eat with him." Now watch this very closely. Now they're just drawing on their human knowledge. We we eat with him. We fish with him. We sleep with him. You know when I read that, you know how personal that is to me? I ate with him. I slept in the tent. We slept in the sleeping bag right together. We talked and we laughed and he would like little stories that I would tell and people I would mimic because I used to do a lot of that when I was a young fellow. He'd laugh and I mean he'd laugh till he collapsed over in his sleeping bag head first and lay on the ground and just laugh and giggle and so on so forth. And so we knew him as a man. &gt;&gt; But he said he said I love to come with you brothers because he says you treat me like a man. But on the other hand, you know, when I read this, I say, "Oh, God, I'm so thankful that you'd let me look beyond the blue jeans and the little cowboy hat and uh and and I'm so glad for the time you came into the automobile." And I knew it was you. And I felt if I took another breath, I would pass out of this world into another. I tell you friends, you talk about unseen hand. We have here that same God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I sense his nearness. I sense his presence. I sense him invigorating me to say certain things to this congregation. And I desire with everything, oh God, let the Holy Ghost permeate this atmosphere. [Music] &gt;&gt; And go through you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Until your life is something different than it has been. &gt;&gt; Amen. says, "We seen in the cradle that he was rocked in and now does this man." This is a hard saying. &gt;&gt; The Bible said they they didn't walk with him anymore that they they left him. And here's the scripture. John 6:66. From that time, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him in the future home. He said, "Here it was in this little woman. She was one of his attributes." And there was a priest representing the light. Listen, if you want, I've given I've given the reference to all of these because I've had some say, if I could have the reference, I'd like to jot it down. I took a lot of time to give all the references to all of these quotes for you. He says, "And this little woman, she had the attributes, and there was a priest representing the light, and he had learned it from the Bible. He had learned that God was God. He had learned that holiness was right. He was learned that there was a law of God. He had learned it because of intellectual conception. And he was born of the right lineage. He was a Levite, but he only knew it by intellectual conception. Young people, it's wonderful you've been born into a family that you've been born into. It's wonderful husbands, wives, that your wife or husband has prayed for you. But it's wonderful that you as couples have come to the knowledge how thankful I am that I and my wife have come to be believers of this message. And what a rest it has been. What a glorious life it has been. But it's not sufficient to learn it. &gt;&gt; It's not sufficient to hear a good sermon. It's not sufficient just to be moved by someone speaking. It is that you need to go and say, "Oh God, the living God that wrote that word, that sent that prophet, come and make it such a reality to me. It's a part of every fiber of my body. It's got to go beyond just our thoughts and our minds." &gt;&gt; Revelation is not what we think mentally. Revelation is something you cannot explain. &gt;&gt; Revelation is something that is it's a it's not even a knowledge. It's it's a reality. It's a life. &gt;&gt; Anybody that's known a love a love for a parent or a love for children or a love for your wife or husband. That is a revelation. That has to be a revelation. &gt;&gt; If it's not, it can disappear. You could get argued out of it or hurt out of it. &gt;&gt; But love, love is stronger than hurt. &gt;&gt; Love is stronger than being slandered. &gt;&gt; Love is stronger than all of these things. But if I said, "Well, define it." You cannot. &gt;&gt; It has to be a revelation to you. &gt;&gt; You cannot. It has to be a revelation. &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "And when the light of the hour," going on in the same quote, "and when the when the light of the hour," he learned it by what he what by what had happened. Understand? He was looking this way and he could he learned because this had happened. There was a track record. So he knew, okay, this happened and God did this and this person responded. Okay, if you have that kind of response. And so we learn all of these things. He learned by what had happened, not what was happening. &gt;&gt; We we desperately, &gt;&gt; you know, I'll say it. It'll probably be quiet, but I'm going to say it and have it over with. It's a very dangerous thing for us just to read books and hear tapes and and be able to say, "Well, God said this and God's prophet said that and said such and such and you got to do this or I got to do that or I have to be this way." It has to go way beyond that. Yes. &gt;&gt; I believe that we have to have a godly honor and a godly respect &gt;&gt; to the messenger &gt;&gt; and a veil that God veil behind. It's God's veil. &gt;&gt; I don't have any trouble with that. The prophet is God's veil. And so we have to have such a deep respect for that. &gt;&gt; But in having that respect for that, we say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; let it be known to me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it permeate me. &gt;&gt; This God &gt;&gt; that you spoke through, I I acknowledge you. I acknowledge you're trying to say something. I acknowledge you're giving an example. I acknowledge that that was for this moment. &gt;&gt; That that was not for 1963 or 1957. That was for now. That was for 209. Because you, God, is speaking to me. &gt;&gt; Give me the Give me the knowledge. Give me the wisdom. Give me the Holy Spirit that I might know just how my life is to be conducted at this time. It's not way back there. It's now. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; In every area of our lives, in every relationship that you can think of. &gt;&gt; Not what had happened, but what what had happened. And when he found what was happening, when he found what was happening, his denomination said nothing about it. You know, friends, I I I have a very very deep sense, a very serious, very I'm very, very serious because we stand in jeopardy &gt;&gt; of that very thing. what has happened and I've learned what has happened and we know what God accepts and we know how he honors faith and we've learned all of these things. It's not what has happened. It's what is happening. &gt;&gt; And then some people when they realize what should be happening, they look at their church and say, "Well, it's not happening." &gt;&gt; You know, it's not happening. And that's when the real acid test comes. say why isn't it happening &gt;&gt; why isn't why am I not seeing this in my life why am I not seeing this kind of commitment this level of zeal and devotion I think that our life and our resolve and our zeal for God should almost be fanatical &gt;&gt; and let the world think what they want to think &gt;&gt; but we're sold outmen Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're sold out. &gt;&gt; All that I have &gt;&gt; and all that I am &gt;&gt; and all I can ever be. &gt;&gt; And his denomination said nothing about it. But there was a redeemer on earth at that time &gt;&gt; to redeem those attributes to God and she received it. &gt;&gt; Then he had 12 left. Now brother Bram said he does this to thin out and so on and others to ponder and he had 12 left. He chose 12 and one of them was a devil and he said so he turned to them and there's no one could explain what he had just said. How are they going to eat his flesh and drink his blood? And how did he come down when he was born right here? See, he he goes right away. He's going from that which requires revelation right back to uh the natural which is just human understanding and how he was born right here on earth and they couldn't understand it. And then he turned to the apostles and said, "Do you want to go also?" And that's when the apostle Peter made that great statement. Lord, to whom would we go? For we are satisfied. We know assuredly that you and you alone have the word of life at this hour. &gt;&gt; At this hour, &gt;&gt; not the word of life of some Moses time or some other time or some future time. But you have the word of life for this hour. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, I announce to you, we have the word of life for this hour. We have the word of life for May &gt;&gt; 209. &gt;&gt; We have the word of life. &gt;&gt; We have it presently. We possess it. &gt;&gt; This same Christ that walked the shores of Galilee, walks in this building today. &gt;&gt; That same pillar of fire stands here at this pulpit like it always has because he will never leave his word. He will never leave his word. He won't even leave it to my human ability. If your faith will come to him, he will answer your faith. &gt;&gt; I'm just here as an instrument. I wish I wish even the prophet of God, he would tell the people their name or tell the secret of their heart. He says, "If it would help your faith," &gt;&gt; he couldn't do it either. &gt;&gt; He couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; All he could do was manifest a gift that God had given him to help their faith. I am trying with everything that's in me to help your faith &gt;&gt; to tell you and I feel I came under a mandate to the pulpit today to tell you this God who delivered this word who sent this messenger who sent Jesus Christ to shed blood for you. He's not back there. He's here. &gt;&gt; He's here. And furthermore, he's not here dumb without words. He's here speaking not through my mouth but by the Holy Spirit right to your heart. &gt;&gt; He's saying more than my words. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's saying more than just your human thoughts. &gt;&gt; He's seeking to bring a revelation. What revelation? That he's he is present. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's enough power &gt;&gt; in this congregation at this moment to do anything. &gt;&gt; Anything. Anything. Our God can do anything, can reach beyond the boundaries. We have people outside of this building in great need. Our God is great enough to span the distance and go to their room. It doesn't doesn't matter how deep they are, how engrossed in sin they are. Our God is able to break those shackles. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And they were satisfied of that. and they could not explain it. You can't explain faith that something that you believe &gt;&gt; and it's so solid that there's nothing else will take its place. &gt;&gt; Therefore, they knew &gt;&gt; that the word that was written for that age. Notice how he keeps bringing it to that age that they were living in the messianic age, the messiahic age that he fit that place exactly. And what could they do but go back to them cold formal churches? They came out of said where should we where would we go to? We are fully persuaded that you have the word of life and they couldn't explain it but they believed it. &gt;&gt; Every man and woman here that's come to the knowledge of the message of this hour. That is the one thing when it comes to this present moment we can't explain it. That's where faith kicks in. &gt;&gt; That's where faith believes the promise. If you could figure it out, it wouldn't be supernatural. It wouldn't require faith and you would not be a child of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But they believed it. &gt;&gt; God has always in every age has hid behind a veil. All ages. But he's been God all the time. &gt;&gt; All the time. That's the emphasis. and he's kept himself hid from the world and revealed himself to his elected. &gt;&gt; Since since Pentecost, God is not acting in man. Now he's acting through man. &gt;&gt; He was acting in a man then Jesus. And now he's acting through man that he has chosen for this purpose. He'd raised up a prophet and was acting God acting through the man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God was telling him, God acting through the man, saying, "Say this." &gt;&gt; Speak this word. &gt;&gt; And God acting through a man for a prophet is for people of the future that will come. His message is prophetic. &gt;&gt; And so God knew. &gt;&gt; Hey, I sat in meetings where there's three, 400 people maybe at the most. And he'd say, "These these tapes go around the world. &gt;&gt; These tapes are going to be translated. These tapes will be played in the jungles. How brother Lonnie and I drove in the jungles of Malawi. Heat that would just melt you. I was so my clothes were soaking wet and we couldn't have the windows of the car open because of the elephant grass that was probably 10 12 or 15 feet high and it was coming in all the bugs and stuff from the elephant grass. So we had to keep the windows up and we drove and drove and drove an hour, hour and a half, two hours and I was just melting. We said to our our brother that was with us, we said, "Where is this place?" We were actually looking for some little grass huts off in the jungles, way in the jungles. And finally, we looked way over a distance and here we could see a grass hut roof here and one over there. That's all you could see was just the roof of it sticking up above the grass. And he said, "This is the place." And we pulled in there and there a brother and uh Malawi is known as the place of submissive women. And they are very very submissive. And submissive in the sense that they would not look up in the face of a man who is a stranger. And they and here they had built a a fence, an enclosure out of this elephant grass and put up a little structure for us to sit in under the shade. And this brother had received this family had received the message and he was spreading the message to other people in that area. And the woman women came with a big platters of uh of fruit freshly cut fruit and before they would come to you I'll just describe it for a moment. before they would come to you about maybe eight feet away. They would start going down like this and then finally they would go down on their knee and then reach way forward like that looking at the at the earth while they handed you the the the uh the fruit and what was on the platter or banana leaves, whatever it was. And I sat out there in that blazing sun in that smell of that fresh cut elephant grass and thought I've heard him say they'll play these in the jungles. Glory. &gt;&gt; What's a little man out of a little tiny church in Jeffersonville, Indiana? Where does he get that kind of wisdom and knowledge? They'll be playing this in the jungles of Africa. I say, "And God found you." &gt;&gt; God found exactly you. Maybe in some city or some farm or some place or how dark it was, but God found you. &gt;&gt; God elected and &gt;&gt; God chose. God ordained that this message I'll send it to you. &gt;&gt; And others have learned things but I will reveal them to you. &gt;&gt; Say how do I know? I don't know how I know but I know I know I know that it is the truth of God's word and as I take the scriptures the scriptures become a living book to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he says that what I'm trying to say that God has God is always that God always was here is here. The only thing he done when he became man he changed his mask. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This an Morphe he changed himself. Notice closely to what he was &gt;&gt; to what he is &gt;&gt; or his mask another act. &gt;&gt; Notice he came first as a prophet. Just a few more minutes please. &gt;&gt; He came first as the prophet and then they crucified him. His own crucified him. He came as the son of man. Then after the Holy Spirit came, he was then the son of God. God is a spirit. That was the ear new testament time. And he was the Holy Spirit, son of God. He lived through the church ages as the son of God. In the millennium, he'll be the son of David sitting upon the throne of his father David. He is the son of David. Now &gt;&gt; remember between the son of God, that's the church ages in a Leodysian church age. They put him out. That that's why when brother Brandham comes to the very end of his m ministry and I was looking for it. I want to give you the quote. He says all the doors are closed. &gt;&gt; I can't get in. &gt;&gt; They wanted his gift but they didn't want his message. &gt;&gt; Who was the message? It was Christ. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the man. They they liked the man. They liked they loved his gift. They'd love to have had it but they didn't want the message. &gt;&gt; What was it? It was to fulfill &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. &gt;&gt; That was Christ knocking. &gt;&gt; I can't get in. &gt;&gt; The door's closed. &gt;&gt; But if you'll open the door, I'll come in. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, it's the door of the heart." It was more than that. It was the door of the churches. It was the door of denominationalism. It was the door of the nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in between and remember he said remember now the leodyian church 8 they put him out and in Luke he said he would be revealed again as the son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of it. I underlined these things. These things have been treasures to me for many years. I'm giving them to you now &gt;&gt; to fulfill the rest of it. Because when he came here and he walked on the shores of Galilee and he healed the sick and did all those wonderful things, but he was not telling the people, he was not telling a people that I've come to take you in a rapture. He wasn't telling the people, I've come to take you off of out of this earth, out of this condition. &gt;&gt; That was not what he was doing at that time. He came with the same manifestation, exactly with the same thing. But the purpose is different. &gt;&gt; It's not what he was, but what he is. &gt;&gt; Not what has been, but what is happening. &gt;&gt; What is happening? If you feel even a tinkle of this of this holy presence in you today. It is for the purpose of of of bringing you into the body of Christl &gt;&gt; so that you will be you will be a recipient of the transforming power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is not what has been. That is what's happening even now. &gt;&gt; If you can recognize that this is God that is speaking to your heart. &gt;&gt; This is God that is drawing you. This is God that's causing that sense within your being. He is doing that for the express purpose of of witnessing to you that you are a candidate for transformation. &gt;&gt; You're a candidate to have the change of this body. That's what he's doing now. And so he came as a son of man with the same signs so that he might he might do that which you could not do to fulfill the rest of it. &gt;&gt; When he was here when he was here he came to pay the price. &gt;&gt; All the price. &gt;&gt; And when the price was paid he said you could say it with me. It is finished. &gt;&gt; It was done. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now he comes the same ride, the same Christ, same pillar of fire from Moses time till now to claim what he bought &gt;&gt; to fulfill the rest of it. You know why you're sitting here &gt;&gt; is because this same one &gt;&gt; that's here in this building has come and he's laying his claim on you &gt;&gt; and Satan tries to give you a bad feeling. He tries to give you a sickness. He tries to give you something. He tries to draw you into his severe and make you ineffective in the kingdom of God. He sees there's a multitude of traps out there. Educational traps, professional traps, all kinds of traps. And he's wanting to keep you from that because his spirit is here. It is effective. He has laid a claim on you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let me describe it for you. And you're moving through life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this grand opportunity presents itself or to a sister or to a brother. And you realize by doing it, by accepting that it's going to cause you to get caught into a certain gravitational pull. And that pull is not going to pull you towards God and his program. It's going to pull you away from it &gt;&gt; ever so little, ever so gently, but ever so purposefully. And he and that gravitational pull pulls you out of the perfect will of God. And you feel something. You hear a voice inside. And you feel something moving inside. I'll tell you what it is. I'll interpret that. That is him speaking and saying, "I have claimed you &gt;&gt; and you are mine and you don't belong to anybody else. you are mine and every believer should shout with joy and say thank God. &gt;&gt; He's laying his claim on me. &gt;&gt; It's not that he just comes with a grand announcement say I've claimed you. That's not the program. The program is throughout this message. He's reaching through this message. He's reaching through these sermons. He's reaching out and laying hold on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you can't let go. Even when you got discouraged, you couldn't let go. When you were offered some great program or promotion, you couldn't go because he wouldn't let you go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm done in just a couple minutes. Fulfilling the rest of it. The scriptures tie perfectly together. Son of man, son of God, son of David. When was it? It's the same God all the time. &gt;&gt; Just changing his form and Morphe. He just changed. It's a great drama to him. He's acting it out. God veiled in his bride. Just a few more quotes now. He changed himself. He poured himself into &gt;&gt; into another mask. &gt;&gt; Listen, my friends, you're this mask. &gt;&gt; Into another mask, into another form. &gt;&gt; Not another person went out of him called the Holy Spirit, but it was he himself. &gt;&gt; You get it? He himself poured himself into the people. &gt;&gt; You ought to be saying that and you ought to be rejoicing. He himself poured himself into the people. &gt;&gt; I ask you, what other church is hearing this? What other people can say, I'm a vindicated prophet of God that made this declaration, and I may not understand it all, but I believe it all. &gt;&gt; I believe every tidbit. walk out of here. &gt;&gt; He poured himself into me. &gt;&gt; I can't be the average person on the street. I can't be the average person in my neighborhood because I had God poured into me. &gt;&gt; Not some intellectual thing, but I had God &gt;&gt; poured into me and even sent Elijah to announce it. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You go ahead and worship. Christ in you. &gt;&gt; How beautiful. How wonderful to think that God pouring himself into the human being into the believer poured out. It was a part of his drama. &gt;&gt; He to do so. God all the fullness. All the godhead bodily was in the this person Jesus Christ. He was God and God alone. Not a third person or a second person or a first person, but that person, but the person of God veiled in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is in the building tonight. &gt;&gt; I'm saying he's in the building this morning to perform miracles. If it's not, then he's not the same one. He is the same one. &gt;&gt; But he does it through his church. &gt;&gt; He does it through his people. That's the God that is in you. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; That's a God who can't lie. &gt;&gt; That's a God who is there's no untruth in him. He can't lie. They shall lay hands on the sick. They shall recover. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's a God that's present. He said in the building now, &gt;&gt; they shall recover in my name. They shall cast out evil spirits. The commission's given to the church. And that's what's the matter with the church today. It doesn't know its position. &gt;&gt; I want you to say in your heart right now while brother Bisco's preaching, "Oh God, help me to know my position." &gt;&gt; I don't want you simply sitting here hearing me preach. I'm preaching with all the force and strength that I have. Oh God, let me know my position. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ in you. How beautiful, how wonderful to think God pouring himself into the human being. Jesus Christ is in the building tonight to perform miracles. The commission's given to the church. If you knew positionally who you was, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; and what you are tonight, &gt;&gt; Amen. there wouldn't be a feeble person in here &gt;&gt; in the next five minutes. &gt;&gt; He didn't say if you could lay your hands on enough people. He didn't say if you were a more of a gifted person or a gifted church or if you had more faith or whatever more. He simply said if you knew positionally who you was and what you are tonight. &gt;&gt; You know, I'll just tell you uh some of some of the grammarical things of brother Benham. says node, you know, and and and when the translations are trans being translated, there is no word for he knowed it. So they said he knew it, which is say exactly the same thing. And I got to this if you knew positionally who you was, I thought he must be meaning who you were or exactly. And I changed it and I changed it back and I just left it like this. If you knew positionally who you was, &gt;&gt; whatever you was Amen. &gt;&gt; And what you are &gt;&gt; tonight &gt;&gt; there wouldn't be if you knew. &gt;&gt; Not if you could pray enough. &gt;&gt; If you just knew who you were positionally in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; I want you to rise to the occasion. I don't want you to say, "Well, I've got this infirmity or I've got this I've got this feeling or I've got this spiritual thing." I don't want you to go by that. If you do, this message won't reach its its objective. This message here today, this morning, is to bring that Christ &gt;&gt; that you've trusted in. That Christ that you say, "I received him and he saved me and he washed my sins and he changed my whole life." That Christ is here at this moment. I mean it's moment &gt;&gt; he can take every situation &gt;&gt; materially, physically, spiritually and turn it around to his glory. We need to say all that I am, all that I ever can be, all that I have. I surrender to you. You take me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes. And he said, "That's right. The thing of it is you're looking off into a millennium &gt;&gt; for something to happen." &gt;&gt; Don't look off into the millennium &gt;&gt; for something to happen. &gt;&gt; He said, "When it's already here, &gt;&gt; do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Does this congregation believe that?" &gt;&gt; I'm not just reading these words. You believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's not look off into some future time or into the millennium when it's already here. &gt;&gt; And now we are the sons of God. Not we will be. We are right now. When this night, &gt;&gt; this morning, I will say right now, this minute, we're seated together in heavenly places. We are in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. I don't care what you find out when you get home or when you walk out of this church. You should have your mind set on God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've got my mind set right. &gt;&gt; My heart set right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And oh, if you'd only recognize that. And I've got a whole number of quotes which I haven't got time for where he said, "If you'd only only recognize, I want to see what God spoke through this vindicated voice. I want to know what is it I need to recognize. What do you need to recognize? &gt;&gt; What do we need to recognize? What does God want us to recognize?" thing he wants us most to recognize and acknowledge and identify that this didn't happen by a sequence of events. This you're not even seated here just by an accident. You're seated here by design. &gt;&gt; God knew before the foundation of the world exactly what I was going to speak this morning. He knew who needed it. He knew how it would hit and strike your heart. And if your heart is saying amen, then I want you to open this mouth and say amen. I accept that. I acknowledge that &gt;&gt; this is God. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe you receive it and it'll be given to you. He said they didn't know it. Why? The Bible said their eyes were closed. They didn't understand it. They were sitting right right with him, walking right with him, talking right with him. He's talking about the two men on the way to Emmas. And this is in this is in this is his text for uh not future home but uh the the text of uh modern events made clear by the prophecy which was his second last message. But this one had that really startled me. This one is the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; He's just been beyond the curtain of time and he's making reference to the same scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand that friends? He's just been in a translation. He's been beyond the curtain of time. And he comes right back and refers to his second last. This will be years later will be his second last service when he'll go right back and call Luke 24 a prophecy. &gt;&gt; And the prophecy is it all comes the same thing. He just been beyond the curtain of time. Listen, beyond the curtain of time. He told me, I was with him just a short time after he told me he went like this. He says, "Brother Eddie, I pinched my hand." He said, "I bit my finger and I felt for my hair because he was largely bald." And he he said, "I felt my head and it was I had a head full of hair." He said, "Brother Eddie, those the women, they came and they were in long dresses, long gowns, and they came and he says they embraced me and said, "Our brother, our precious brother." And then came Ben, like millions of them, embracing him, our brother, our precious brother, and the one that was with him. He said, "Who are these?" &gt;&gt; Same as John, John the Apostle in the book of Revelation. Who are these? He didn't know who they were. Brother Bam says, "Who are these?" Said, "These are these are your converts to Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Converts to Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe my theophony body was there &gt;&gt; running. I don't know. These are your converts to Christ. &gt;&gt; And he goes to Luke 24. And this is what he's quoting right here just as I bring it to a windown. And they didn't know. That's the two on the way to Emmas. They didn't know why the Bible why the Bible said their eyes were closed and they didn't understand. They were sitting right with him, walking right with him, talking right with him. They had they had eating with him and didn't know who he was. And friend, that's as true as it could be today. That's as true as I'm standing on this platform that the resurrected Jesus Christ is right in this building talking to individuals right now. If you could only recognize that that's his voice. [Applause] That's his voice. &gt;&gt; I preached what God put on my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the same as a wise man looked had to look beyond the child. You'll have to look beyond this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're going to go and probably sit and eat with somebody today. He says they ate with them. Lord, &gt;&gt; they were in their home. They walked together. &gt;&gt; I want you to walk different than you ever walked. And I want you to eat when you're around the body of Jesus Christ. And that you'll ponder deeply. These are jewels that make up the crown of my savior. These are those who have been purchased by the very blood of God himself. These are priceless ones. These are his bride, his wife. This is who he chose &gt;&gt; of all the multitudes. &gt;&gt; He chose this one that I shake hands with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This one that I sit beside. Don't eat and don't talk and don't walk with people fail after this service to recognize and to ponder who this is. Oh, this is mom and this is dad and oh, this is brother so and so. This is sister so and so. If you could only know, if you could only realize really who it is. &gt;&gt; It changed everything. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about yesterday and I'm not talking about tomorrow and I'm not talking about, oh, you know, we're all going to be changed and we're going to go in the rapture. Just forget it. You got to be going. You got to be walking in what you're supposed to be in right today. &gt;&gt; If you don't recognize what he is today, how you going to recognize what he is up the road? &gt;&gt; We're not living up the road and we're not living in the past. We're living right now. This Lord's day in 209. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's in the building. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here to do real things. &gt;&gt; I defy the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. I defy and deny the enemy that's trying to work his evil works amongst his people. I defy and deny him that right. He has no right to the bride of Jesus Christ. He has no right to put his dirty, filthy hands on God's people. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; I don't know whether you're going to rejoice, but I'm going to rejoice &gt;&gt; in this glorious victory and deliverance &gt;&gt; of my Lord Jesus Christ. And when this brief life is over, which is just a vapor, &gt;&gt; we're going to pass and take a step into another dimension, into another realm, sir. &gt;&gt; And you will know that the things I spoke this morning are the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I would like to sing maybe brother Rod, you could help me. I want to sing uh just of course first here is love. You can stand. You've been sitting quite a while. Thank you for your patience. &gt;&gt; This is the only service today here and service in Seattle. We pray, same presence. Please friends, don't just go from here as a say, well, I'm a member of Florida Bible way. I go there. I'm preaching this to change that whole perspective, to change it all. say I'm a I'm a group of people that have heard a very very wonderful and strange message sent from above. A divine message to me. Hallelujah. And I'm very conscious also that there are situations which we encounter that we would dearly love to change in a moment of time. I just say to you just leave it in the hands of God. He's the master. He knows how to handle lives. He knows if I had my way this morning, I'd reach beyond the walls of this church. And I would change homes. I would change lives. I would reunite broken people. I would heal broken bodies. I would deliver the bound for out of out of their life of drugs or alcoholism. I would do it in a moment. But this God that I serve, &gt;&gt; he cannot lie. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I pray and I believe and if I go to the grave, as the prophet said, I'm looking for the place where he said it. I go to the grave in faith and I rise. He says, God who cannot lie must answer to that faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's where I stand this morning. God who cannot lie. You can have the most impossible situation, the most impossible person just in the drags of sin and bonded and you can't say how can this ever be? This is impossible. Nothing shall be impossible with this God. &gt;&gt; Will you accept it? &gt;&gt; Will you believe it in the name of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Here is love. Here is as the ocean of kindness [Music] as a fly with the Grace [Music] sh for us is precious blood. Remember [Music] to say we will never for hallelujah. to our eternal day on the mountain [Music] through the God's mercy. Oh my go. [Applause] He will. He will. people through our [Music] eternal day. Grace and love like mighty rivers flowing [Music] from above. and perfect justice. Yes. The world [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] for love [Music] to our [Music] eternal king. &gt;&gt; I bring out brother Moan, one of you to come and pray a prayer of blessing upon the people and dismiss us with the grace of God. And I trust that today we'll you'll have time with no service tonight. You'll be able to ponder and think about these things. I'm probably reading the unveiling of God for I don't know how many times in the last two three weeks just trying to move my way through it. You know what I'm doing? Not to read it. Not to get a message. Not a bit. Lord, help me. Help me to understand. Help me to grasp. Help me to absorb this divine thing that you're trying to tell us. I know we're in the coming of the Lord, but just where are we? I know we're in the message. I know we're on in the unfolding. I know we're in the end time message, but just where are we in it? Let me know. I don't want to know about the past. I don't want to just hear about the great things that happened. We're we're serving the same God. Help me to grasp and understand that and take it into myself. Pour it in, Lord. Pour it in. &gt;&gt; Pour it in. &gt;&gt; Will you join me in that? &gt;&gt; Pour it in. Oh, God. Nice to see you, brother Ed Nicaroo. God bless not only you, but we give praise to the God who has turned aside that thing in your body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, let the same atmosphere. If you are, you know, well, if you were here and the messenger was here and the prophet was here, start speaking the secrets of your heart, you, oh, how that would help your faith. But the one who has that knowledge, you already know the secret. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The God who led this message into my heart, he knows that secret. You don't need to have it told. He's given the word to you. He's given the promise to you. Do you accept that? Do you believe that? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We'll just sing the chorus once again as our brother comes. [Music] &gt;&gt; To sing his praise. He will never be forgotten throughout his eternal day. Shall we pray? Gracious heavenly father, we come in your sacred presence today. We acknowledge the things that we have heard this morning. And Father, we want to recognize these things in the way you would want us to recognize it. For too often, Father, we have just been on the surface of things. It's just touch and go sometimes, Father. But Lord, you spoke things to us and you asked us to ponder these things. &gt;&gt; And it's in pondering these things that Lord, we can enter into the depths of your word. &gt;&gt; And we can fish out Lord the flesh and the life that Lord you want to commit to us. We thank you today for the precious words that were preached from this pulpit. &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank you for a servant who has preached his heart out for his people to see that Christ is formed in them and to see the expression of sunship come to the place of adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for every effort that has been made towards this meeting this morning. And father we don't know what the fruits will be but we are hoping that as the seeds have been planted that Lord you would come around and the Holy Ghost will water and that father you will bring forth life the kind of life that you will be pleased about. Father, you taught us in your word that when we bless, we will bless after this manner. We say, "The Lord bless you and the Lord keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you. The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace." You said, "In this way, we are to put your name upon your people." Yes. &gt;&gt; And Father, I have put your name upon your people this morning. &gt;&gt; And as we depart one from another, we pray that these words, oh God, would bring forth the fruits you're looking for. In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we beseech you. Amen. Amen. Thank God. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Have a wonderful afternoon in his presence until we meet again, Lord willing, on a Wednesday evening. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.
