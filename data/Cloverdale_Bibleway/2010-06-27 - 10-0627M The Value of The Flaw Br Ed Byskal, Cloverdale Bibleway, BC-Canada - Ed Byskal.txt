Amen. God bless you. To welcome you all into the house of the Lord this morning. Amen. You happy to be here? Praise the Lord. Maybe we can just begin the service singing blessed assurance.

Father, we've come in expectation to hear from you this morning, knowing that you hear us, oh God. &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We want to go to prayer at this time and ask our brother Tom if you would just come and open the service in a word of prayer. We don't have any written requests. We know there's many needs amongst the people and many times I keep the prayer requests from previous services just to bring to my mind different requests and want to continue to remember our brother Shawn Martin who lost his wife a few weeks back with four children. The youngest one who's only a few months old. I want to just continue to pray that the Lord would be his portion and be his his comfort, his encouragement, his strength during this time and continue to remember the body. Amen. Brother Tom, if you would just come and take these knees before the Lord. Let's pray. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We do bless your name, Lord. We bless that holy name, that worthy name, that name that is above all names. We worship you. The living God, the lovely Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, would you be pleased with our worship this morning. The saints have gathered. The presence of God is here. We believe angels are here. We believe the glory of God is here. So with uplifted hearts and uplifted voices and our hands lifted up, we want to worship you, the true and living God. this great unveiling of God, this mighty God that has been unveiled before us in this hour, Lord, for a mighty message that has come that if people realize and know who they are, what an hour, what a day. &gt;&gt; And we lift up that word that has done such mighty works within our lives. And so Lord, any need, any any hurting, any pain, any soul that needs a deliverance, any bone that is needed, Lord, we believe the presence of God is here. And so we ask you, Lord, that you will take every burden for you are the great burden bearer. That you would pack that burden this morning if we cast them at your feet. You say, Lord, would you deal with them? Would you help them that need help? Lord, we're not helpless. We're not hopeless because we believe in a God that is real and alive. [Music] Lord, we sense your nearness. We just want more of you. So, as the pastor will come, would you anoint the man of God? Lord, may you move the man aside and let the Holy Ghost minister to our soul and may our hearts be open to you that you may take the pen of your word, scribe that love letter again deep within our hearts, Lord. Minister to the needy, meet those that have a need this morning. And father, I know that as we leave the house of God, there will be praise on our lips, thanksgiving in our hearts to know that you're a real and living God that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity. So, great high priest, would you minister in a great way this morning? And may father from every song that be sung Lord may you be glorified be glorified in our lives. We pray in Jesus precious name. Amen. Amen. God bless you all. You may have your seats. just have one announcement to make and and that will be a change of the schedule for the summer time over starting next week July 4th weekend. We'll be going to a one service on Sunday and um already we have four or five families that have left us. They're on holiday somewhere. So, I'm sure there'll be others and families leaving and departing, but that won't hinder the length of the service. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, one day we keep on saying, "Well, let's just carry on the morning to the evening." Well, maybe this summer's the summer. &gt;&gt; You keep pulling and God keep moving. That's all we want. The Holy Spirit to start moving in our lives. Not just having one service on Sunday. We're having a continual service on Sunday. &gt;&gt; So, we'll look at it that way. And we have our Wednesday night service, of course, and our Friday night prayer meetings that the saints are gathering. Brother Kyle gave me a wonderful report and I and I so love it when I get those little emails. The Friday night prayer meeting was such an unusual encounter with God. And that's what we're looking for, brother Roy. That's what we want. So, Friday night's prayer meeting's open. We'll just gather and worship God. So, God bless you. Starting um July 4th, and we'll make that announcement tonight for some saints that aren't here. And uh we'll just remind one another. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Once again, we want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And those who are on the internet streaming with us, we just hope that you feel a part of the service this morning. Our brother Darren has an announcement for us regarding the school meeting we had a couple weeks ago. Brother Darren, if you would come and just give that for us real quickly. And just as he comes, an announcement uh also want to welcome a visitor, uh, Sister Mon from Belgium. Where is she? We could have her stand so we could welcome her. She's with us for a couple months. God bless you. Welcome. Thank you for welcome. Thank you. Also want to make an announcement that there will be a junior choir practice this afternoon at 3:00. And Lord willing, they'll be singing for us tonight. So, sorry it's such short notice, but being this is the last Sunday with two services, we'd like to have the junior choir sing for us once more. Amen. So, brother Darren, if you'd come, just give us the announcement. Good morning. Uh we just want to give an update on the uh school building project. About two weeks ago, we met in the fellowship hall just to discuss some of the finances of the church and uh but the main reason for the gathering was to discuss the pro the uh the status of the school project. um to make you aware of what's been going on, to make you aware of the finances that will be involved in in taking on such a project as that. And so once we had the presentation, we had asked everyone, you know, we want you to fill out a feedback form because we want to know whether or not you support this project because the one thing that we don't want to do is, you know, burden the congregation with with a a debt, a mortgage that the congregation was not willing uh to back up to support. And so we gathered all the feedback forms and I didn't go to bed till like 1:00 in the morning. So I'm going to count those and get all the information. And uh you know we were thinking in our minds, yeah, we think it's going to go ahead. You know, we think there's enough support for it. But the amazing thing was is that when we tallied up the results that we had 112 feedback forms from we asked the people who pay ties to the congregation here if you would just provide your feedback, you know, if you were in support of the school, how much money you were able to uh, you know, to contribute each month, how many hours a week you were able to contribute as a volunteer. And the results were were overwhelming in favor of the school. We had 112 forms handed in and 107 were in support. So that's 90 about 96% of the congregation that were in that meeting and there's about half we figure about half of the uh eligible um voters were there. Well, not the voters but people who could provide the feedback. So it was overwhelming um to say the least that that many people were in support of it. we thought were maybe 60 70% of the people, but it just showed how much the people are behind the project and we really appreciate that. So, uh we've been doing more work where the Kim Dingwall has been work continuing to work with the city. Lord willing, we'll have the building permit on Monday. That's tomorrow. Uh we'll begin to clear the land of the trees, the uh the school annex, and the the old playground equipment. And then, Lord willing, again in about 2 weeks, we're going to start digging the hole. So, we're excited that God is, you know, just continuing. We're just continuing to take steps of faith to see if, you know, the Lord's willing to have the school building go um to go ahead. And we're just excited that we're going to finally be able to offer all the way from kindergarten to grade 12 for our children here. And so, we'll have lots of capacity now, the full gymnasium, the classrooms, the different labs, library. And we just thank God. And we thank you all for your support and your generosity. going to say God bless you very much. Thank you. Praise the Lord. I went to a couple years at BCA way back in the day. 93 94. It was a long time ago, but it's come a long ways and I'm really impressed to see what the Lord has done and what he's done through the brothers and sisters here. So, God bless you and our teachers. We appreciate you very much. God bless you. Uh, brother Gerard from Switzerland is here with us. So, he's going to come and bless us with a song. Maybe as he comes, if we could just sing, "Can't you see why I'm happy?" accept of the word of the Lord. Amen. Oh, can't you see [Music] why I'm so happy? Oh, for I accepted the word of the Lord. [Music] Is the real word that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi once again. Oh, can't you see why I'm happy? Yes, I rejected the word of God. It's the reveal word that was spoken by the prophet. Lord, can't you see? Oh, can't you see? Why I'm so happy. Oh, for I accepted the word of the Lord. the red word that was spoken [Music] by the prophet [Music] Lord. One last time. Oh, can't you see why? [Music] Oh, for I've accepted the word of the Lord. [Music] The revealed word that was spoken by the prophet. [Music] God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus. This is about brother Gerard. Somehow I got pulled into this. We had him over for evening meal last night and we were playing and singing together and so I'm going to sing one song with him and then he's on his own. He plays guitar, plays harmonic at the same time and we were really blessed with it last night and figured that it would be a blessing for you all. So sing with us. We'll sing ala just to get warmed up and worship the Lord together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we come to you in worship. No matter what the circumstance, no matter what the situation, [Music] we will lift up the holy hands [Music] and I want to worship you. [Applause] [Music] I long to worship you. Oh Lord, we come to you in worship. No matter what the circumstance, no matter what you say you wish, we will be a holy handy I long to worship you. [Music] And [Music] I long to worship you. Oh, [Music] I to worship you [Music] and [Applause] I long to worship him. But God bless you first and I would like to thank you brother Ed and sister Bruce Biscar for having invited us in Hokub and we have spent that night a week. We have been visiting others Christian families in the states and hover in Cloverdale. You have been blessed and we thank you for your your blessing and we thank you to invit us. It was so so great and uh I've been in Christian since long in this message since quite a few years and uh one day six years ago we just met brother uh head by emailing and he went to twice twice in in Switzerland. It was really a great blessing. So I think it has blessed open a door in Switzerland somewhere and uh you know what uh I feel a bit uh emotional. It's difficult to to explain but you understand that. And um I would like to say uh in my life my my dad did two things. He gave me a small one. He gave me an ammonica when I was 8 years old and I plac in that till today. And uh he did another nice huge things. He gave me a book a booklet one day. I was 18 and uh he was just smoking cigarette and he went to a kiosk and the ladies gave him back with a cigarette a booklet and he gave it to me because uh we were Christian he knew that but he didn't like it so much and said it's for you read it and uh you know what it was it was the fourth seal of brother Balam booklet so it was wonderful and uh I I said in myself uh Well, the heaven is speaking to the earth in a truly way. And I was very affected in right and I knew it was true. It was truthful. It was really there and I don't know why but we had to to wait. Two years passed by and we have to wait until we get really in the message and it's a long way don't want to speak about but we are there today. We have we enjoy to stream six six years and uh we have been so blessed by all the ministry that Don does other than ahead of course and uh we like it so much it's a a great blessing in our heart and uh I will to try to to play something for you know it's quite something FL so many people so uh I need to be relaxed a little bit and I will try to get out of those uh those uh instrument something. I was 18 when I I started the guitar a little before and uh I I received in my mind why don't you try to mix up those both instrument I was 18 and uh it it started very hard because you know you have to concentrate you have to maybe you play too much more guitar and less harmonica and the bows and it took time to settle the thing all together so I enjoy it I I hope it will go tonight and I hope I I count on the L the Lord help of the Lord to to give me the like it was yesterday night, &gt;&gt; last night.

Jesus loves me. The media following, we'll have the baby dedication. Brother Jesus, God bless you. I am bound for the prois land. I am bound for the promised land. Oh, who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. On Jordan stormy banks I stand and cast a wishful high to cens and happy land where my possessions land. I am bound for the promised land. I am bound for the promised land. All who will come and go with me. I am bound for the promised land. &gt;&gt; When shall I reach that happy place and be forever blessed? When shall I see my father's face hidden in his bosom rest? I am for the promised land. I am for the promised land. Oh, who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. I am bound for the promised land. I am bound for the promised land. Oh, who will come and go with me? I am bound for the promised land. [Music] I'm a child of the king. A child of the king. With Jesus my savior. I'm a child of the king. My father is rich in house and land. He holdeth the wealth of the world in his hands. A provision in diamonds of silver and gold. His comforts are full. He has riches untold. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the king. A child of the king with Jesus my savior. I'm a child of the king. Father's own son. The savior of men. Once earth as the poorest of them. But now he is reigning forever on high and will give you a home in heaven by and by. I'm a child of the king. A child of the king with Jesus my savior. I'm a child of the king. I'm a child of the king. A child of the king with Jesus my savior. I'm a child of the king. [Music] Faithful of our father's living still in spite of dungeon fire and soar. Oh, how our hearts beat high with joy whenever we hear that glorious word. Faith of our father's holy name. We will be true to thee till of our fathers we will love both friend and foe in all of our stri and preach thee to her love knows how by kindly words and virtuous face of our father's holy name we will be true till day of our father's holy gra we will be true Oh f of will be true to the children our father we will be true [Music] [Applause] This part of the congregation never ceases to amaze me. Uh just for some facts, these songs, I looked them up on uh one of these internet sites that do the history of songs. The first time that I am bound for the promised land showed up in a song book in the current version that the children sang it was in 1895. I'm a child of the king showed up in a song book in 1877. And Faith of Our Fathers first showed up in a song book in 1849. I am bound for the promised land was actually originally written in 1787. Well, so I've been asked, why do you pick songs from the Philadelphiaian church age? And um quite literally in the light of Hebrews 13:8, I'm going to read Deuteronomy 19:14. Thou shalt not remove thy neighbors landmark which they of old time have set in thine inheritance. Israel collectively inherited that land. And the landmarks that were set there were set there for a reason which thou shalt inherit in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it. And in Psalms 127:3, "Lo, children are inherited of the Lord." &gt;&gt; These are our inheritance. Um, each age, you know, as they're presented in eternity, um, we in the late age, as in all the rest of them, uh, we've simply progressed from one stage to the next as God continues to unveil himself. There's all of that I said to just make this one particular point. There is not two gospels. There is only one gospel and the same gospel that will speak to and create create a a seed in the heart of a 40-year-old is the same gospel that does that in a four-year-old. So that is what the Sunday school and the teachers try to reinforce each week and that is what you as believers are teaching your children at home. Having said that, I have one small request. I do have a need next year for a teacher. Uh this teacher is for the four-year-olds. And um I'd like to admonish everyone to go back and listen to the church age, not the church age, the church order message that was preached in 56 or you can read it in your cood book if you want to. And um for all of you sisters that have your family is grown and gone, that's means dragging grandma out of retirement. Yes, I know all that kind of stuff. But that's the age level that brother Brandham pegged as the ideal teacher for this class. So if you can pray about it over the summer sometime after camp, uh you know, come to me and tell me what the Lord's told you, would you? Okay, we need a teacher next year. So anyway, for our uh our missionary offering uh this year, uh consulted with brother uh Dingwall and to see what Bible believers needed to have happen. And I'd like brother Andrew Gruner to come grab our box. Brother Biscll, if you could come on up here and uh Sister Gindo can bring the envelope. Missionary offering. Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday School. The Sunday school of Cloverdale Bible Way would like to present their 2010 missionary offering to Bible believers to be used toward the purchase of a hub print station for the believers in Indonesia. This year's missionary offering consists of $595 $994.35 Canadian and $114.52 US for a total of $78.87. Thank you. I'm not going to lift that. I know about how heavy that is. Well, but it's all in pennies. &gt;&gt; It's close to pennies. &gt;&gt; I'll let you Richard and God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Sunday school. &gt;&gt; Wonderful to hear all the songs. Thank you so much. Brother Richard's done such a splendid job with the school for so many years, the Sunday school. We're so appreciate that. Do you want to lead us in a course while they go down? And and we're having a baby dedication. Brother Eugene and Sister Gina Ivaneno. S. Sing same chorus again. Jesus loves even me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Oh yes, I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Oh, and I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. [Music] I trust the children will be able to find their seats. Uh, won't be long, brother Eugene, Sister Gina, when you be stand. We're just so happy. Uh, we we rejoice with you. Amen. That's that's how all these children got here. You're just joining the club. How's it feel to be mom and dad? &gt;&gt; She hasn't said she she hasn't said much yet. Brother Eugene and Sister Gina have called their little girl Lily Anna. And I actually had a a picture, but I won't take the time. I had a picture of the lily of the valley. And there were a number of varieties. And one time I I really did a a study on it. It's a beautiful flower and uh has representation of our Lord Jesus Christ. And I trust that this one, this lily in your home will blossom into the beauty as God gave a plant, but into the fragrance also of a Christian life. That's my desire and that's what we'll be praying for. and Anna, Grace and Favor. Uh those are two names which are certainly uh I trust will reflect her life. And while I thought of uh your child and the names and and how you're blessed now with this daughter, how you choose to bring up this child will have a great effect on her future. I've spoken to a lot of children over my life and uh even in much my senior years it's amazing how children will come and uh I I can speak to them and I find that there are traces of uh their childhood and very early childhood and they recall and remember things that mother did, father did and uh and it's amazing how it's had effect on them and it stays in their mind. Uh they'll remember the earliest times. They'll remember laying on the perhaps on the floor in a blanket in the in the church. And you just cannot determine when the Holy Spirit they begin to sense something before they can even speak it. And sometimes they can sing something before they actually learn to talk well. And it's surprising uh how children are affected by the atmosphere of the church and atmosphere of a home. Very very much affected by the atmosphere of home. And I believe that a child brought up in a godly atmosphere will have much less to overcome. Uh brother Brandham said this about his own life. He said, "I tell you parents," he's speaking to parents. So he speaks to everyone here but I'm directing this uh more specifically to brother Eugene and sister Gina so that you'll remember this occasion. He said, "I tell you parents, you put the right kind of home before your children. That's the thing to do because if I had had a Christian home, he said, I'd have been reared up in perhaps I would have been further along with our Lord Jesus tonight and may more people have been saved." But my people was not a religious family. I thought that's so incredible. And I thought about your family, brother Eugene, and your parents, which I believe are here. Uh, your siblings and sister Gina, your parents that are here and to know how they have held the faith and have believed and and what has taken place. You have such a wonderful opportunity to pass this off to Lily Anna and I pray that you will do that. The things that you know, the Bible says, the secret things belong unto the Lord our God. But those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of the law. And in this case, that we may do all the words that God has revealed. The revealed things belong to us. And the revealed things belong to her, to Lily, Anna. &gt;&gt; And it will be your lives, your atmosphere, the home that's created and and how you relate to her and how you relate to one another. This will be passed on. The revealed things that you hear here in the house of God and that God speaks to you, they belong also to her. I'm going to dedicate Liliana to the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you, Lord. Will bow with me. Father, we really cherish this moment. And I know that Brother Eugene and Sister Gina, uh, they have something in their heart that they're holding. They're they've looked forward to this time. You've given them this jewel, this child, this dear one. And I know that they will treasure her. They will raise her up to serve you. I pray, Father, that in uh one of the first names that she'll ever have recollection of will be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. May they instruct her. May they tell her the Bible stories. May they encourage and faith in her heart, Lord. And I pray that she early in life will come to know you as her savior. That you'll protect her and put a wall of fire about her and keep her from every evil thing. I pray. And God, I ask you to give her good health. And I pray that she will be a happy child. I pray she'll be a healthy child. And Lord, as you have given her to brother Eugene and sister Gina, they now stand here as to witness that they are giving her back to you. I pray you'll watch over her, oh God, and may her life be a delight in your sight. I dedicate Liliana in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Jane. God bless you. Amen. God bless, sister Gina. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, should I preach? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we ready for the word? &gt;&gt; You're a wonderful congregation, a wonderful young peoples. And I hope that you rejoice also with the announcement that the school is going ahead. &gt;&gt; And you know when the people take a step of faith, are you all here all listening? Brother Darren said two weeks. I believe it was the Lord that inspired brother brother Kim Dingwall who's done a lot of work on this project along with the trustees and everyone else been working probably a year and a half two years on it. And uh, Brother Kim Dingwal called the government of Canada, the federal government, and asked them about the tax because there's taxes on all the building materials and everything that goes into this building. It's a almost a 30,000 square foot building. We'll hold 225 students and it's a full facility. And we just felt that this was something that should be done. And the government said, "No, you'll pay tax. You have to pay tax on it. Uh the only way that you get out of taxes, the only way that you we wouldn't be taxed is if it were a certain type of a process of between the church and the school." And brother Kim was able to quickly respond, "Well, that's exactly the way it is. That's exactly the way we're set up." and he says, "Oh, well then uh you won't have to pay any tax and I'll open a file right now and I'll send you the forms. Just fill out the forms and you'll come and and soon as we get the forms, we'll just be it'll be a file here." And brother Kim just did a quick calculation and there uh $150,000 was deducted off of our budget. So God bless you with that. &gt;&gt; Is uh I wonder did brother Daniel Brother Daniel Kihangu is he here or he's was in Seattle. I know when they're having a meeting brother Caumbi is down there preaching. I didn't know if he came. Uh, brother Daniel and I have been emailing back and forth and uh, his his mother just passed away. We we mentioned it here in church and left. Uh, there's five children altogether. Brother Daniel is the eldest at 23 years old and the rest of the family is back in Kenshasa, Congo. Uh, there's another brother that's 22. There's twin sisters that are 21 and there's one sister of 18. And brother Daniel had just told me, he said, I don't know why, but he said the last time I was in Congo, his father had passed away. And now his uh his mother, but at that time his mother was living. They're very young to have passed away. And she uh brother Daniel said, "I don't know, but something came over me and I just I prayed that God would preserve her and at least until her his youngest sister of 18, she wasn't 18 at the time, but that that she would be through school and she was writing her last final exam when she passed away." And I think that was the grace of God. Uh so we want to not only pray but I think we'd like to do I'd like to do the these five young people now they uh we'll find out more. I'll find out more next week but I don't I don't think they have really anything to live on and uh uh I think it would it's only right that we would contribute and do something. Uh, brother Daniel probably wouldn't want me to save the say this, but he's just been scrimping and saving because he's also taking further education in Seattle. And uh, he had saved up $2,000 for his education to pay for his further education. And all of that was needed for the expenses and for the family and and I think they haven't even covered hospital bills or whatever. And so if you would like to contribute, I won't take an offering this morning, but I'll let you know about it and we are going to take an offering uh maybe next Sunday or after I've had a chance to talk to him probably two weeks from now. Would that be all right with the congregation? Would you like to do something? I I God has always blessed this congregation and I think that when we encounter something like this, well, it it it's pleasing to God. uh these all now don't have fathers or mothers and that is quite a concern and and but God knows and he he has received both to himself. Would you stand with me? We'll not sing anymore so you'll be free. Before we read the scripture, uh, I want to read out of Isaiah 53, but I'd like to have you bow your head with me. Heavenly Father, I sense and feel such a strange and wonderful presence. It is your presence. You have moved close, Lord. You are moving within my heart and I know the hearts of the people. There's a a sacred there's a sacredness. There's a quietness. I believe you've been pleased with the worship. Oh God, as the people began to sing about their blessed assurance. And then as the children sang, oh God, songs of the saints of ages past, songs that are as as alive this morning as they were when they were first inspired by the Holy Ghost. I pray, Father, that you will bless the uh congregation that is here and those that may be streaming and that are streaming through wherever they are on this planet earth. I pray that the same spirit will penetrate the homes and the hearts and the rooms, oh God, wherever it might be taking place. I pray that the same blessing of God will come upon them. Fill, I pray, Lord, everyone, every vessel, fill us to overflowing. May your word become so quickened. May things be spoken today that will never be forgotten. I pray that you'll brand our hearts, brand our minds, Lord, and prepare us even for this service this evening as our brother Tom will be ministering. I ask, oh God, you'll receive us as we present ourselves to you as living sacrifices in the name of our blessed beloved Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd open your Bibles, time has slipped away on us, but I I have a very unusual message on my heart, and I would like to have just as little movement as possible. And if you'd just give me your full and undivided attention in Isaiah 53, I'm going to read only five verses, starting with verse one. Who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall go up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground. He hath no form nor calmliness. And when we shall see him, there's no beauty that we should desire him. Isaiah the prophet is prophesying of our Lord Jesus Christ. Of course, he is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from him. He was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him, stricken, uh, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. And the chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes we are healed. God bless his word. as you have your saints. One of the most striking statements that I've pondered so much that brother Brandham has spoken uh when he preached the masterpiece message. He said concerning uh Michelangelo in his uh his statue or his uh work artwork of Moses and he said he struck it and he made a flaw on it. He said and it and it made a flaw on it. It put a flaw on the image. He said, "To me the flaw was what made it the masterpiece." That takes a great deal of thought. That's a very deep statement that the flaw made the masterpiece. I want to speak to you with God's help on the value of the flaw. A flaw is to do physical harm, to impair, to deface or defigure, disfigure, perhaps to blemish. That's a mar. But a flaw is a defect. It's a fault. It's an imperfection. It can be a physical disfigurement that prevents something from being totally perfect and distracts from its value. That's what we know as being a flaw or a mar. Something's marred. Michelangelo, he marred his uh his great statue which he had made. I was very moved as brother Ryan opened the service with uh blessed assurance because this is the first thing I was going to show you. I want to show you the author of uh that song. Would you give me the first one there? Could we dim the lights a wee bit also please? Uh the scripture was written, "And I will I will bring the blind by a way that they knew knew not. I will lead them in paths that they have not known. I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them." We have here a couple pictures of Fanny Crosby. Brother Brham referred to her many times. Born in 1820 and died in 1915 about her blindness. She said it seemed intended. It seemed intended by the blessed providence of God that I should be blind all my life and I thank him for the the dispensation. If perfect earthly sight were offered me to tomorrow, I would not accept it. I might not have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me. She was asked by uh and spoken to by a a minister and who said to her, "It's it's it's really sad that uh you haven't got your sight. Such a gifted and talented person. Perhaps you would have uh been been able to express so many other things." And she quickly responded that if I were offered sight right now, I would refuse it because she said, "The first thing I want to see is the face of my savior." &gt;&gt; And she wrote the song, "I shall know him. I shall know him &gt;&gt; by the prince of the nails in his hands. I can say that she certainly had a flaw in life, &gt;&gt; but she used it for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; She didn't wallow in in it. She didn't wallow in the ground. She didn't allow her life to become a burden to others. She rather she gave glory to God and has blessed centuries of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. wrote over 8,000 songs. When Fanny died, her tombstone carried the words, "Aunt Fanny and blessed assurance, Jesus is mine." Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine. &gt;&gt; I say that she indeed increased the value of the flaw. &gt;&gt; She could have just been blind, but she increased the value. She accepted it. She increased the value of it. And we may not have that kind of extreme uh example of a flaw in our lives, but I'm I want you to sit close and sit quiet. I'm going to come home to your address. And God has laid this. I have never spoken such a subject, but it is forever. Who whoever is here. And you may have thought you came as a visitor. This is for you. You say, "I come here all the time. I'm a member here." This is for you. You may be streaming and you say, "Uh, well, I'm I'm streaming and I always stream, but I want you to listen to this service differently." This is for you. I won't take the time to read the beautiful, beautiful poem that was read at her funeral, but it just started out by saying, "Away to the country of sunshine and song. Our song bird has taken her flight, and she who has sung in the darkest so long now sings in the beautiful light." Brother Brandham said about her, "The reason I respect blind Fanny Crosby, she never sold her gift out to the world. She kept it with God. My old blind Fanny Crosby had never seen in her life. But she screamed, "Pass me not, oh gentle Savior. Hear my humble cry while on others thou art calling. Do not pass me by. Moses had a flaw. The prophet said that all the prophets had flaws &gt;&gt; and we all have flaws. He spoke about Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph. You can turn the lights back on now if you would please. Being the foundation corners of the great rock that the new masterpiece Jesus Christ would be built on. And he said Joseph's life was perfect. &gt;&gt; But he said he had a scratch. &gt;&gt; There was just a scratch. &gt;&gt; And the scratch was he said to his parents, his father rather, and his brothers, when you come, do not into Egypt, do not say that you're that you're shepherds because that's a uh that's looked down on. So say something that you're herders or that you're herdsmen or something, but you're not shepherds. But when they came and his father came and Pharaoh asked them, "What are you?" He said, "We're shepherds." He said, "That was a scratch even in Joseph's life." Uh, and you may sit in life, you may be sitting here today and saying, "Everything's going fine and everything's wonderful." and and young people whose lives are perhaps carefree. But let me just say this that you don't live very long before you feel a scratch. [Music] &gt;&gt; And my message today really has and I feel a real urgency and I feel stirred a message thrusting through me that it's it's what you do with the flaw. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you do with it. And there are different ways that it comes. Sometimes it can be uh something direct that God actually does. For example, uh the the the this masterpiece message actually has its commencement with with Adam being in the image of God and God directly wounded him and took Eve from him and that was the mar in in in Adam. But it it had to have that in order to achieve a bride and a wife for him. And Christ was marred and at at Calvary that the bride of Jesus Christ would have a life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Moses, he had a flaw. Sometimes it can be something not that God does directly, but something that God allows. &gt;&gt; He may allow it. &gt;&gt; A very very bad thing can happen. Very evil in your from your perspective can happen. But maybe but God often allows it to happen. And then we can ask why has God allowed this to happen? There is a positive spin to it. &gt;&gt; And if you're not careful, you'll take the negative side because Satan is inspiring the negative side and he wants you to think about the negative part of it. And the negative part of it can make a person embittered, &gt;&gt; can make them angry, &gt;&gt; can put a very negative twist in their life and and and wrench them out inside and they live a life far below where they should as a son and daughter of God. And then there's a third one and that is self-inflicted. We do things and we are so filled with regret and remorse and repentance and and on and on. Remember, you must deal with those things according to the scripture. If you do wrong, you repent. You you you you must deal with the flaw. You must deal with that self-inflicted wound so that God even can take it and and use you as a result of it. This is what I'm going to be speaking about. And I know we all have it. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I want you to I want you to take and absorb the service this morning and apply it into that area of your life. And if you can't apply it as of right now, probably next week or next month or who who knows when you will be able to apply it. The Bible says of Moses what God be to speak to him. And Moses said to the Lord, "My, oh my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither hereto for, not since thou hast spoken unto thy servant, but I am of slow speech." I want you to hear this. I'm going to dwell on that a moment. I'm of slow speech and of a slow tongue. And the Lord said, "Whoath made the mouth? Who's made the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind? Have not I the Lord? &gt;&gt; And the slow, the word in the Hebrew is to be of heavy, to be weighty words, to be grievous words, difficult and burdensome, and even very oppressive. He wasn't eloquent. He didn't know how to say it. He just said it straight out and straightforward. and and perhaps his his language was burdensome and it came across oppressive. Do you know what some multitudes say concerning the prophet's message? It's so judgmental. It's so hard. He's always stripping us down. I'll give you two signs like Moses. But maybe he also that's why brother Brandham said, "I'm not educated. I can't preach like these men can preach. I I don't have the education." It was a burden to him. &gt;&gt; But it did not prevent him from saying, "Thus says the Lord. &gt;&gt; It did not prevent him from receiving and hearing the word of God for you, for this generation." &gt;&gt; And he never rided himself of that flaw with his hints and his canes and all the all the grammar of the self. He still remembered a se still remained a seventh grade educated boy from Kentucky who didn't have any friends. &gt;&gt; He also carried all through his life because I was with him when he was 52 and 53. One day he just turned to me quickly because his daddy was an alcoholic. His daddy was a uh a bootleger and produced liquor. And brother Brandham was actually carrying the water from the for the still when the wind came into the trees and he heard the voice speaking to him. But he had that flaw all his life. And his parents were Catholics. And as I said to brother Eugene, sister Gina, he said, "I didn't have a religious home. Perhaps if I had, I'd been further down the road and more souls may have been saved." &gt;&gt; He had a flaw and he carried it all his life. He said to me one day quickly, he said, "Brother Eddie, my daddy was a alcoholic, but he said, "If you ask me right now," we were standing in a motel room. He said, ' If you asked me right now if there was gold bricks stacked from the floor to the ceiling of this room, he said, 'If you asked me what I would per sooner have that pile of gold bricks or five minutes with my daddy, he said, I'd take the five minutes with my daddy. &gt;&gt; So it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars for him &gt;&gt; to be able to have five minutes with his daddy. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say that's a person that made the best of a flaw &gt;&gt; and had his daddy die in his arms and was able to pray for him and pray with him and see his mother converted. &gt;&gt; He took the flaw of a Catholic family and turned the thing around. &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought of David. I just added this this morning. It was in my mind because I can see it all through the scripture, but I'm just wondering which one I should pick. And I thought of David and it's described in in Samuel and he wanted to build a house for the Lord and he wanted to do so many things and he had it in his heart and God sent Nathan and spoke to him. This is after he had taken Uriah taken Uriah's wife Ba Sheba. He said, "Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight? Thou hast killed Uriah the Hitittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and has slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from thine house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hitittite to be thy wife. Thus saith the Lord, behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son. For thou ditch it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son." You might say, "This would be a hopeless situation. He took and had a man killed." so that he could have his wife and he needed to do so because she was already carrying David's child and God said he'll he'll die. You talk about a flaw. &gt;&gt; You talk about a a a mar in a person's life. But God never took away the fact that he would still be king. God never took away from him that his his praises and and and and God saw what he would do with the flaw. &gt;&gt; He accepted it. &gt;&gt; He accepted God's sentence and he said in the Psalms where he's worshiping, "Let my sentence come from your presence. Don't let it come from some man or a group of men, but let my sentence, whatever it is, let it come from your presence. &gt;&gt; And God so loved him &gt;&gt; and he took his flaw and wrote some of the most glorious verses in the scripture and prophesied of Jesus Christ and reflected Jesus Christ in his life. And don't ask me how, where, or how this happens. And through that woman, Ba Sheeb becomes Solomon. God even allowed because God knew what he would do with that flaw. He accepted it. He didn't get bitter against God. He didn't question God. He received it. &gt;&gt; It's not whatever will be will be. No, it is taking it and and and putting it in a in a in a different uh you put it in a different environment and say I accept the sentence of God. I accept the word of God. I accept the forgiveness of God. I accept it and I will give my life as a sacrifice to God and let him do whatever he wishes with me. The tell the scripture tells us in in the book of Acts when the apostles were filled with the Holy Ghost and when they heard these things they were cut to the heart. I'm going to be going back and forth, but you'll follow the theme. They were cut to the heart and they nashed on him with their teeth. And that was after a a 30 secondond message that Peter gave also. When they heard when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them. Peter had preached and I counted it. I read it myself like preaching. And it is no more, not even quite a 30 secondond sermon. &gt;&gt; And I thought I should read that sermon, but I won't even take the 30 seconds. But you know who was sitting there was Galio. &gt;&gt; The the instructor and teacher of Apostle Paul was sitting listening to this 30 secondond message. And when they said let's slay these people, Gale stood up after hearing a 30-second message and he said, "Let it let us not do this kind of thing. We can't fight God." And he turned and his his speaking convinced the people to turn away from killing these men. But why did they arise with such a an anger? Why did they have to spill out so much evil upon them? Because they were cut to the heart. &gt;&gt; It was the truth that cut them to the heart. These were like the words of Moses coming heavy and grievous and oppressive. &gt;&gt; We don't want to hear these things. We don't want to hear we can't cut our hair. We don't want to hear how we ought to dress. We don't want to hear how we should live and what we should see in our homes and the kind of material. We don't want to hear that. This is too oppressive. It's thus sayith the word. &gt;&gt; And we receive those heavy grievous words and say this is God speaking. I need this and I will benefit as I I receive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a burden to the apostles to have to speak that way. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had to say, "I don't I don't hate the sisters. We love them. I'm trying to help them, &gt;&gt; but it was a burden in his life." &gt;&gt; And he was identified as a woman hater. He was identified as being all kinds of things and the message is still identified that way &gt;&gt; and you can accept that rather than trying to smooth it out. Apostle Paul's great teacher, he was affected by that 32nd sermon and talked those religious leaders out of killing the apostles. And when when the scripture says in the Greek they were cut to the heart, it was that they were just like saw a sununder to be sawn through mentally and and and to be to be rent and torn with vexation. This wasn't something light, friends. This was something that were having an incredible effect upon people. But the apostles, it is like they were looked upon as having a mar having uh that they were identified as being ignorant men, raw to the point, saying that they couldn't put the message in a in a nice framework. You just had to tell it the way it was. Amen. &gt;&gt; We still need it. &gt;&gt; And then when Jesus was speaking, he said, "Many therefore of his disciples," these were believers &gt;&gt; who had professed to believe on him. They were in church. He said, "Many therefore of his disciples when they heard this saying, or rather heard this, said, "This is a hard saying. Who can hear it? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in Jehovah Gyra, the trouble of it is we have got so much Hollywood preaching and not enough oldtime rough preaching. I like the old time kind that really tears the hide off of you. Brings it down to a place where it belongs. Too much petting around. We need the oldfashioned gospel preached in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. That's what the world needs today. How many here can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; But for saying those things, he was despised. &gt;&gt; It is Jesus Christ that's still being despised and rejected. &gt;&gt; Said God doesn't need compromisers. &gt;&gt; God doesn't want his church to look like the world. He doesn't want it to act like the world. He doesn't want it to have anything to do with the world, only to preach the gospel to the world and to call those forth. God wants separators. &gt;&gt; The church wants mixers. They want a pastor who will not be so hard on them and tell them good things and not dig right down, just rake the hide off of them. Brother, that's what we need. And in this day, this is the thing we have to be so concerned about because everything around us, our entire environment and the prophet said that the pressure of this great age is soft living. &gt;&gt; It can be dangerous. &gt;&gt; So if you have it, use it for God's kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever it might be, I say soft living is a flaw on this generation. Soft living is disfiguring this generation. &gt;&gt; And I believe whatever generation we are raised in, we can take that and use it for the glory of God. You got a home, use it for God's glory. Use it for hospitality. You got a car, use it when believers have need. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, use it for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Be faithful to the house of God. &gt;&gt; Be faithful with your testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I say once again repeating there are different aspects of wounding or to mar or to cause a flaw. &gt;&gt; I remind you again some are allowed by God and some are brought upon us by other people or circumstances and some are self-inflicted. Some are the results of nature. Fanny Crosby, born blind. I looked at others. There were great people. I won't even talk about them. Einstein couldn't hardly write much of his life. Very intelligent people. Stephven Hawking. I saw him here in Vancouver trying to speak through his computer uh dying with Lug Garrick's disease as it were. And yet one of the most brilliant minds if you saw his twisted up just such a hopeless helpless sight twisted up being wheeled in a wheelchair and and with this motorized chair I should say and and speaking one word and then another word and another word and taking questions from the taking questions from the people. several hundreds of people are there and yet the eyes of the world are on him because he has the most brilliant mind I guess since Einstein. I would say that not for Christ necessarily. I don't know what his belief is but he has not allowed that dreadful flaw and disfigurement in his life to hinder him from what was driving inside. Listen to me friends. We have something inside. If we're a believer, you have Christ inside. And now we need to listen to the inner man and let the inner man motivate us and drive us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be a tool and a vessel for the kingdom, not for this world. &gt;&gt; Don't serve this world. It's all passing away. &gt;&gt; Serve it to live. Serve it to provide for your family. Serve it to pay your bills and do what you ever need to do. But don't sacrifice the house of God. Don't sacrifice your spiritual life before Christ. Jesus said as he was coming to the marring as he was coming now to be so brutalized that his visage would be marred more than that of any man. Can you believe that? Brother Brandham describes it and I tell you you want to have a strong stomach. But he said, "No man taketh," speaking of his life, taketh it from me, but I lay it down with myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. And this commandment I have received of my father. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "God gave his son. Jesus laid his own life down and yet men crucified him." So this is one where God and even brother Brandham says God smoked him &gt;&gt; but actually in human form it was men that smokeote him but God was allowing them to smite him. God was allowing man to make the mar but God was actually responsible for the mar. God gave his son. &gt;&gt; Now hold it close. Men thrust the thorns on his brow. Men drove the nails in his feet and hands, but God gave him to be the sacrifice. So God arranged it. &gt;&gt; And this flaw, this mar was not something that Jesus ran from. He ran to it. He'd be despised of men and considered smitten by God. &gt;&gt; But out of the flaw, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; came a voice. &gt;&gt; Out of the flaw came the blood that speaks better things than that of Abel. And the prophet, he dwells on it so much that when Michelangelo was finished with his his statue and his image of of Moses, he said it was so perfect when he saw the image that he had in his mind. And he said he worked for years and he labored for years and spent such a large part of his life and he saw it in his mind and all it was was a a block. It was just a a piece of stone. But in the stone, he saw an image. He saw Moses in the stone. &gt;&gt; And when he finally had it done and had it polished and and touched up here and there and and and and he thought that it was so real, it must speak. And he took his hammer and struck the knee and said, "Speak." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham ties that over to Calvary when he finally saw an image here on earth. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, stay with me now, please. When he saw the image here on earth, he he he he didn't only desire a son. He desired a family. &gt;&gt; He desired a relationship that would be that of husband and wife. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you that have not experienced husband and wife relationship, let me tell you the relationship that the Lord Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost will take you into will supersede the husband wife human relationship. &gt;&gt; It can supersede it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Not just because I'm preaching it, but if you can say that &gt;&gt; it supersedes it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was looking up beyond the physical frame. He was looking beyond the physical when he said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." But when he led and he led that son the the the the dove leading the lamb and led him up to Calvary and beaten and uh and bloodied and finally he comes to Calvary and men who are breathing God's air &gt;&gt; who have ate God's food &gt;&gt; who God gives strength in their muscles &gt;&gt; and they are the ones with the hammer and drove move the spikes and the one that took the spear and thrust his side. I've said it before and perhaps you can't understand it. He did us a favor. &gt;&gt; Even the cruel Roman soldier did us a favor when he thrusted his side and out came blood and water. But the prophet said, "Of came spirit." The only spirit that can mingle with your spirit &gt;&gt; for the first time in history and the last time in history. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Came out a spirit &gt;&gt; out of a broken blood cell. He said the blood cell was broken and only that spirit can come into your spirit &gt;&gt; and make you a new creature in Christ Jesus. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said you'll still have the sticky nature. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to deal with as I go along. You'll still have the sticky nature. I say you might as well accept it. There's people who spend their entire life trying to get rid of it, trying to get rid of it. I'm not talking about sinful things. I'm talking about the the sticky nature. &gt;&gt; God knew you'd be born in a natural birth. &gt;&gt; God knew every footstep that you take. And some of you come from good homes and some come from very dysfunctional homes. And some come from very sad situations. And it's fine for me to go back back in the Bible and I've given some of my own testimony. Brother Brandham often told his life story and he told it in minute detail. Sister Debbie Kanye, I spoke to your husband years ago. Sister Debbie is many years ago. I couldn't even recall all the details. I won't go into all the details, but her and her sister, there was a number of children. I think another four, maybe about six children in a home with an alcoholic mother and alcoholic father. And the children are put out into foster homes and the whole family is essentially disbanded. And she talked with me and said, "I I want to make contact with my family and we've been separated all these years and certain members of the family and and she was so burdened. I could see she was just so crushed. Now, that sister sits here. I'm not talking about 3,000 years ago, 4,000 years ago. And every one of you here have something that you're carrying and you wish it could be different. And I'm going to say, take the situation where you are and where you find yourself and say, "God, I give it to you. &gt;&gt; I will not surrender up any of my spiritual Christian standards or walk. Let my sentence come from your presence, but I will. I give it to you. I will not let it intimidate me. I will not let it stand in my way. I give it to you. Whatever that thing is, whatever whatever arrangement I came out of. &gt;&gt; And I saw that Sister Debbie was so burdened and crushed over this. And when do you think it goes away? It doesn't go away. &gt;&gt; You think about it at night. You think about it when you lay down in bed. You think about it while you're working, while you're busy, while you're active, while you're doing things. You're thinking about it. It's always there because it's you. &gt;&gt; Not talking about what's in your nature. I'm talking about circumstances. &gt;&gt; And the circumstances may be those that you didn't were were imposed upon you. There may be others that were self-inflicted choices that you made. Uh we have David's case. We have other cases in the scripture which it was not the people's fault that they were birthed into. It &gt;&gt; wasn't Sister Debbie's fault. And mother and father are both alcoholics. She had nothing to do with the fact that they went out to foster homes, different foster homes, and she doesn't have contact. And now she comes into the message, and she wishes that they they could hear the same gospel. She hears. Amen. &gt;&gt; To make a long story short, and I won't go into it, just a year or so ago, I was able to meet Sister Debbie, her sister, older sister, and her husband, and both have come into the message. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want to pass a bouquet to brother Mike and sister Debbie, &gt;&gt; and it never has entered my mind. It has never come to mind. But as I was studying and I put it down and Debbie, your your name came up and then I pushed it away and then it came up again. I pushed it away and it came up and so I felt I have to say something and then it seemed like the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said she took a flaw. She took a mar. took the burden uh oppressive condition from her life but didn't let it affect &gt;&gt; her spiritual walk &gt;&gt; and her service to God and God has brought now the older sister and her husband and it just seemed like the Holy Spirit said to me they the scientists say that the world is that the universe is expanding and for the first time I thought maybe that is right because as people are birthed into the family of God, he throws another world out there or another 10,000 worlds. &gt;&gt; And I said, "God bless you, Sister Debbie." 20,000 planets went into space when they went into into God's kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why not? &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "One soul is worth 10,000 worlds." That's not some poetic language. That's the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm here today to declare you live your life for God. Regardless of your past or regardless of what you suffered or regardless of your situation, don't let Satan poke anything down that memory channel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I was standing here and I'm bringing it home and you knew me to have slept with a woman and that she bore a child as a result of it and God killed that child. I don't think you would want me to be a pastor. &gt;&gt; I don't think you'd want to hear me speak &gt;&gt; because your eyes would be on the flaw. &gt;&gt; And David could have just kept looking at the flaw as well and saying, "Look what's happened to my life. I' I've ruined it. I'm I'm good for nothing." God still saw him as one of the greatest kings of the Bible and he wouldn't change it. &gt;&gt; I'm not suggesting that I have committed such a sin. I can in fact say I've been I've been true and I've lived a clean pristine life and the only woman I've known is my wife. &gt;&gt; I say that for the glory of God. But let me say this. This might not be the testimony of other people but I am no purer than you and you're and and brother Brandham is no purer than anybody. The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses and erases every transgression. So to you that may have self-inflicted wounds, &gt;&gt; let me tell you that the that the Christ of this gospel &gt;&gt; erases and the prophet furthermore says that when your confessed sin drops into the bleach, he said it actually becomes bleach. That's beyond our comprehension. &gt;&gt; And then there are others that are imposed upon you. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Sister Debbie that chose my parents should be alcoholics. It wasn't you that chose that your situation would be what it is. Some of you are single parents. It wasn't you that chose your husband or wife would depart you and leave you. It wasn't you that chose certain things would be a certain way. I'm saying if the reason why God, hear me good now. The reason why God so loved David, it was because God could set his sentence on his act and David would accept it, but he would say, "This will not hinder me. I will not let this impair my love for God. &gt;&gt; I will not let it stand in my way." And that was so complete &gt;&gt; that God allowed and predetermined that Ba Sheba would bring forth Solomon &gt;&gt; who was a type of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And under Solomon he the prophet said Israel essentially had a millennium. &gt;&gt; That kind of God we don't know very much about. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In case anybody thinks you don't have a flaw, &gt;&gt; don't don't be too self assured for when the scratch comes. when the flaw comes. &gt;&gt; How I thank God for clean lives and how I thank God for lives that haven't, like Brother Brandham said, I might have been further down the road. I just want to say I don't care what has happened in your life. I don't care where you came from. The God that I serve and the God that is present here today knows precisely your situation. He knows what has caused it, what has created it. He has watched you every step you've taken. And he is saying right here this morning through my lips that you turn your life, you give what you have to him. That's all he wants. &gt;&gt; He's not wanting a bunch of bunch of works. He doesn't need a bunch of things so you he can justify you. He just wants you to surrender your life. the talents that he's given you, the gifts that he's given you, just turn them back to God. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't be reduced to a churchgoer. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't merely become religious. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, are you hearing me? Don't turn this message into a tradition. &gt;&gt; Oh, now we're so happy we're believers that we just live nice little lives and go to church and so on. Don't do that. Say, "Here I am. &gt;&gt; Speak, Lord. What do you want me to do? What do you want me to be?" [Music] &gt;&gt; And don't forget this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Flaws. And then in the beginning was the word and the word was with God. And the word was heed out and reflected what the word was at the beginning him. The word reflected in the masterpiece in his own likeness. God back again in his own likeness. The word form being reflected in the image of a man, the masterpiece. And he said, "All prophets had flaws." Now, I'm kind of jumping all over, but you forgive me. I'm just so moved. I'm having a hard time delivering this to you. I've talked a lot of you and I know the burdens you bear. You surrender it up to God. &gt;&gt; The scripture says that when God saw Jesus the father, the word now in flesh, and a voice spoke, "This is my son in whom I'm pleased." And on Mount Transfiguration, a cloud covered him in a voice. This is my son. Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the prophet and I'm so thankful for the message. The prophet said that when uh when Michelangelo and he's he's bringing it right up to the present time when he saw the sun when he saw his image and when God saw his image because there was something he saw on Calvary that he didn't see while Jesus was walking and coming out of the water. He saw something on Calvary and the prophet is bringing to us so clear and he takes a hammer and now God is allowing it and struck the image and when the image was struck the blood cell of God the the the beginning of the new creation. Please grasp this &gt;&gt; the image the beginning of the new creation the blood cell &gt;&gt; that had been in the womb of Mary. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Which was a creation of God. &gt;&gt; The beginning of a new creation. The blood cell broke and God saw his family. [Music] &gt;&gt; God saw you. &gt;&gt; I can prove it to you. &gt;&gt; He asked through He asked through Isaiah, "Where's my family? Where's my household that you build to me?" &gt;&gt; In other words, where's my family? Where's my household? The heavens my hand has made. The earth is my foottool. But where's the house &gt;&gt; that you build me? Not a building, not cedar, not stones. Where's the house? You look at in the Hebrew. Where's my household? Where's my children? Where's my sons? Where's my wife? Where's my household? &gt;&gt; Where's this kind of relationship? God doesn't need gold. He doesn't need silver. He doesn't need your offering. He doesn't need your tithes. He doesn't need anything. He just wants you. &gt;&gt; He wants that spirit that's in you that his the life from his blood cell came and mingled with your spirit and made you a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; And that life is so powerful. &gt;&gt; It can control the sticky nature. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've got something. You've got something greater than your sticky nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said he got so inspired. &gt;&gt; And I just it was as though I could see God, the almighty one. All of his focus now is on what's happening on on this hill called Mount Calvary. called Goth. And when he sees and and finally that son is so battered, he saw Isaiah and what he spoke to Isaiah, it's all been passed, all been fulfilled. He sees it right before him. A lamb, a bleeding lamb, and it's so perfect because he knows this is the answer. &gt;&gt; And he struck it. &gt;&gt; And out come the blood and the spirit. The blood went to the earth and the spirit ascended. It's the spirit of God &gt;&gt; to come back into the believer. &gt;&gt; That's why we speak so forcefully on the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. And you shall connecting word and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. It's not some man laying hands on you and making you to utter some words. That's not it. &gt;&gt; It's him who said, "You be baptized and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; And you'll have God, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; living inside of a sticky nature. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon was even asked a question when Apostle Paul said, "When I would do good, evil is present with me. &gt;&gt; And what I would do, I do not. The good that I would do, I do not. And the evil that I would not, I do. &gt;&gt; And a man asked a question in questions and answers. He said, "This I don't understand." Brother Brandham said, "Well, it's a cockle bur with a wheat seed in it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With wheat life in it. &gt;&gt; But God got so inspired And the prophet kept saying it. He struck it &gt;&gt; and cried, "Speak." &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say anything. But the blood spoke. &gt;&gt; The blood cried out, "The price is paid." &gt;&gt; The blood cried out, "Redemption is complete." [Applause] &gt;&gt; The blood cried out, "Here is the family. &gt;&gt; Here's the family of God." And our prophet of God said, "You were there &gt;&gt; in him at Calvary." Do you believe that? You were there. &gt;&gt; Call your name out. Say, "I was there." &gt;&gt; On Calvary, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the blood spoke out, &gt;&gt; this is redemption. &gt;&gt; Not half, not 90%. This is redemption. You've never heard me say what I'm saying. If I committed the sins of David, you wouldn't want to be here. Your human reasoning just wouldn't quite allow it. &gt;&gt; But you see, you would be, I'm really coming down. You'd be looking at the flaw, &gt;&gt; not at what you could do with it. &gt;&gt; And what David did with it, he accepted the sentence of God. You should read the Psalms now after this service. It was what he did with it. If you focused with what he did with it, &gt;&gt; then you would understand. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, we have the Holy Spirit now." That's right. But we have some of the same flaws. &gt;&gt; We have some of the same, &gt;&gt; weighty, &gt;&gt; burdensome, &gt;&gt; crushing, oppressive. &gt;&gt; Mars in our life. &gt;&gt; I've been born this way. I've been born in a certain country. I've been born with a certain home. I've had a mess of my life. Tell you what, God's not looking at the mess. &gt;&gt; He's looking at what he provided to fix it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm speaking today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Furthermore, I have come not &gt;&gt; those that are not sick, they don't need a physician." &gt;&gt; Those that are righteous don't need Christ. &gt;&gt; He said, "I have come. I have come &gt;&gt; for those that are sick. &gt;&gt; Those that recognize, I need a savior. &gt;&gt; I need a total redemption. I need the life that came out. I need the blood that speaks better things &gt;&gt; than evil. &gt;&gt; I need a voice that says, "You're forgiven." &gt;&gt; I need a voice that says, &gt;&gt; "Lay your life down. &gt;&gt; Give me &gt;&gt; your heart." God got so inspired. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul carried a flaw. He even mentions it. He said, "I stood when Timothy was being martyed." And furthermore, they laid his clothes at my feet. And I stood there and I never said a word against it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; First church heritage messenger. &gt;&gt; If you look at his flaw, &gt;&gt; you'll have a hard time seeing really what he achieved in his life. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I blasphemed. &gt;&gt; I was a blasphemer, but I did it ignorantly. &gt;&gt; I didn't know any better. That's not people. I've heard things said about believers. And whatever you do with those that have found fellowship elsewhere and gone elsewhere, be careful what you say about them. &gt;&gt; Leave it in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; I've heard things and I've said that's so close to blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; They walk on such dangerous grounds. When we speak about one another, we speak about how they've lived or what has happened to them. I can tell you one thing, a surrendered life, God is looking at what you will do with thy flaw. &gt;&gt; Moses said, "I can't speak." God says, "I'll have you to speak." &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I'll give my whole law to you. You'll be the first prophet, and I'll give your whole law. And no man will speak with God like you're going to like I'm going to speak with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he came down and was a mouthpiece, brother Ernie, of Almighty Quad. &gt;&gt; But it was coarse. &gt;&gt; It was hard. He was of slow laborious, not slow in length of speaking. It It was laborious. And he just had to say it. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. &gt;&gt; And he just laid it out there, right? And some of the people could handle it and some couldn't. &gt;&gt; That did not change his status with God. &gt;&gt; Your flaw, &gt;&gt; I'm here to say your flaw, whatever it might be, does not change your call or your status with God. Can you say amen to that? Why don't you say thank you Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; And don't spend your life trying to get rid of it. Don't spend your life being bitter about it. &gt;&gt; Just say, "I am who I am, &gt;&gt; and I give it to Christ. I give it all to Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I get up to preach." You know, I'm not a preacher with this my Kentucky grammar and the his and the haint and all those words. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; So, I can't say this. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. what we call a modern preacher today. &gt;&gt; I couldn't take its place. I couldn't take that place because I have no education. Came out of a meeting and there were children standing there and a little boy wanted his autograph. Said, "I can't even read my own writing. How are they going to do it? I'm giving you a little bit of a taste of what you think that he didn't labor under that his childhood despised and no one wanted to even walk on the same side of the street. You think he didn't remember that? Yeah, he remembered that cuz he told about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was in his mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the Brandham name and how it was turned down. And he says, "Now I got friends all over the world. left to run to hide. Then he said, "Dear friends, I'm not young like you all this morning, but I'm old and I've been through many hard battles. And by going through those hard battles brings you where you are this morning." He said, "You see, so I'm sure you understand that God has put me God has put me through it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every person here needs to say that same thing. &gt;&gt; God has put me through that. &gt;&gt; He said that. And there is a reason that my life might open up a way and say this is it. &gt;&gt; Some of you maybe been hiding behind your flaw. Well, you know, I'm kind of shame. This is my home or this is my family or this is my background and I'm kind of strange and the kids at school, they kind of make fun and my family's kind of looked down on for this reason or that reason or a whole multitude of reasons. We kind of hide behind. I say come out from behind that bush. &gt;&gt; Come out from behind that excuse. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I am what I am &gt;&gt; and I give it to the glory of God. &gt;&gt; I'll believe the word. I'll live according to the word. But I give my life to God. &gt;&gt; I will glorify him one way or another. &gt;&gt; But Satan shall not rob me of my opportunity in this life. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And I'll do what I can. I'll do everything I can to live a life that is a a credit to this gospel. sticky old nature. When I say sticky, right away you think of something that clings and adheres to you. That's right. It does. I've been trying to get rid of it for 76 years. Excuse me. 75. And I got to back that up a couple before I found out what I was like. So for a lot of get rid of that, &gt;&gt; you know, then you get down say, "Oh god, I just failed. I'm such a failure. I just I think I'll just throw it in the towel." And the devil's just standing there and say, "Do it. Do it. Throw in the towel. Give up, you wretch." &gt;&gt; Isn't that the truth? You need to remember it's not the flaw. It's not that old hindrance. It's not that old sticky nature that I'm going to give whatever I am. &gt;&gt; I'll let God deal with the sticky nature. &gt;&gt; Now, now I got a surprise for you. You might be saying, "Well, thank goodness something's going to come out of this service." You know what? It's that weakness, that inherent weakness. It's that frailty. It's that thing that troubles you all the time that keeps driving you on. &gt;&gt; And if you didn't have it, you wouldn't be driven on. You wouldn't go to your knees and say, "Oh, God, deliver me. Oh God, forgive me. Oh God, help me once more. I'm so This has happened so many times, but please, just once more. And that kind of motivation is going to put you right into the rapture. That's the truth. Right into the rapture. And when you got on the other side, you'll say, "Thank God for the flaw. If I didn't have the flaw, if I hadn't got that mar, if I wasn't born that way, I'd have just lapsed back. Hey, there's a lot of people that got the same conditions and circumstances you and it doesn't bother. They just they have another drink. &gt;&gt; Just smoke some pot and forget all about it. &gt;&gt; It doesn't bother them, but it bothers a son and daughter of God. It bothers us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The waring of the flesh. The scripture says, "For the flesh lusteth or desires and wars against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh." I thank God for that one. The flesh is lusting against that life. It has all kinds of other desires. But the spirit, &gt;&gt; the spirit that came out of Calvary The spirit that came out of Jesus is in you. &gt;&gt; And that spirit is stronger &gt;&gt; than the sticky nature. It's stronger than the flaw. &gt;&gt; Your past, &gt;&gt; the spirit that came out, Satan's looking, pointing at you, pointing at you, look at your past. But the spirit has a voice. And the spirit is saying you're forgiven. &gt;&gt; The spirit is saying it's under the blood. &gt;&gt; And I don't know if I can speak on behalf of God, but I believe God's saying, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I was so inspired. I saw them forgiven. &gt;&gt; I saw them as my family. I saw them as the blood washed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. No wonder he was inspired. &gt;&gt; So I have this and I want to give it to you as a phrase. The waring of the flesh against the spirit just makes us more resolved, &gt;&gt; more determined to sacrifice and lay our lives down for the cause of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; He would like you to become affected and atrophied. Say, "Well, I because I'm this or because I'm that or because this happened to me because I I guess I can't do anything." You tell him he's a liar. &gt;&gt; You can do lots for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; I speak to every man, woman, and child here. You can do lots for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; And you must. &gt;&gt; Is it not an option? Amen. &gt;&gt; For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after. Can I have a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to or after the flesh. We do not war as our mind would tell us or as a human would be. For the weapons of our warfare are not cornal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds. &gt;&gt; And Paul said in Romans, "Who shall lay anything? Anything. Say that with me. Anything. Who shall lay anything against lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifyth. It was God's blood cell that was broken at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? &gt;&gt; And even yourself. You don't have a right to condemn what God has justified. &gt;&gt; Don't belittle Calvary. &gt;&gt; Don't give Satan any credit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died, yay, rather that is risen. Who is even at the right hand of God? Who who also maketh intercession for us? Shall the flaw of tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, every one of those is a service within themselves. &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul said, "Who shall separate us from the from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, I'll say the flaw of tribulation." &gt;&gt; Amen. None of us want tribulation, but you got it. &gt;&gt; You will have it sometime. There will be a scratch no matter how blessed and perfect your life and home is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You may live the most pristine life. &gt;&gt; Look at the prophet of God. Absolutely flawless life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But there was all kinds of things that have been said and continue to be said against him &gt;&gt; and against us &gt;&gt; who bear the message. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall tribulation or distress, you have distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or the flaw of peril or the flaw of the sword. As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I want this congregation to repeat with the Apostle Paul. We are more than conquerors. Say it again. We are more than conquerors through him &gt;&gt; that loved us and he demonstrated that love at Calvary when the spirit left him to come into you. I'm going to stop now. I'll just take these few minutes. &gt;&gt; I wanted to speak on the inspiration of his vision. Maybe I'll take just a few moments to highlight it. Amen. &gt;&gt; For we, all that are here, all that are streaming, all that have been bloodwashed, we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Created in Christ, &gt;&gt; unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we shall walk in them. No wonder he got inspired. No wonder God God inspired. It wasn't the Romans or the Jews that killed him. God became inspired. &gt;&gt; God bruised him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bruised him to get you out. &gt;&gt; To bring you to this time. &gt;&gt; I hope I don't sound repetitious. &gt;&gt; We're his workmanship. Brother Brandham says back yonder and sometimes we don't let your mind become just uh like what I've heard that before. Keep it in perspective with what I'm saying. before the foundation of the world, before he took this old sun, and he moved it around this old star, this earth that we're living on now, this earth, and he molded it over here by the sun and laid it around the sun, and he molded it on this side and let her hang there for a hundred billion years. What was he making? Some gases. And he moved on around to this side and he made something else. What was he making there? Some pot ash. And he moved around this way. And what was he doing? He was making some calcium. What was he doing? He was making you and me. &gt;&gt; I just want to ask you something. If God spent perhaps a few billion years to make this &gt;&gt; here so that we could live &gt;&gt; for 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years. And he did that for the calcium that he put in the earth and the petroleum and the pot ash and so on. So we could live here and have a little expression. Do you think he wearies with shaping that inside person &gt;&gt; and he molds? He knows that flaw is there. He let you even be born with it. He let you be born in such a kind of family. He knew even those things that are self-inflicted. He knew those things that we would do, those sins or those things we would commit, those things that we even ask forgiveness. And Satan doesn't want you to forget it because that that kind of thing is in the blood. He doesn't want anything that comes from the blood. He'll be sure and resurrect everything. Keep it right fresh in your mind like it happened yesterday. &gt;&gt; Say, "I can't even see that. God can't see it. &gt;&gt; It's in the blood. It's under the blood. It's gone." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And somebody might say, "Well, you know, how was it confessed or how did you confess it?" That's between you and God. &gt;&gt; That's none of my business. That's between you and God. &gt;&gt; And then you just say with David. Say with David, let your sentence come. Let my sentence come from your presence. &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear it from the church. I don't want to hear it from a preacher. I don't want to hear it from some good people. I want my sentence to come from you. &gt;&gt; And if you if you've done it, then you can prosper my life. You can allow the life of Christ to live in me. I only desire here's my life, Lord. &gt;&gt; And let him do the rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's amazing how he'll start confirming it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. A minister said to brother Brandham in the masterpiece, he said, "Why is it that you're always balling the people out? Those people believe you to be a servant of God, to be gentle and sweet to them and everything." said, "Every time I hear you get up, you're balling the women out about having short hair or about wearing shorts or wearing makeup and balling the people out and telling them how cold and formal and different they are." Said, "Why do you do that?" He said, "How can you be?" And he said, "How can you be a loving son of God and do a thing like that?" And I said, "Sir, did did you ever read about the great composer Beethoven?" He said he probably tore up wasteful baskets, waste baskets full of scrap paper, but he gave the world a masterpiece. You know where we are and what you see. I've never said this before, but it came so powerful to my own heart. We're living in a world. This world is God's. It's a waste basket. &gt;&gt; It's full of crumpled &gt;&gt; paper of things. That's not the plan of God. when your flaw or or your past or whatever more was done, there was a time God crumpled up the paper and threw it in a waste basket. &gt;&gt; And he's going to dump this waste basket out. &gt;&gt; It's going to be so thorough. Stay with me in my little language now. It's going to be so thorough and so complete that he's even going to send a holy fire, the prophet said, and burn the heavens where the demon spirits have lodged &gt;&gt; and come down to tempt you and to give you a a terrible life. &gt;&gt; And those hordes of hell &gt;&gt; that have played on your mind. I'm not preaching to somebody outside of this building. I'm preaching to you here or you that are in the in the streaming congregation at the hordes of hell that come and don't tell me they don't talk to you. They talk to you like they talk to me. &gt;&gt; And we have things that if you could do it over, you'd go back and do it again. Forget it. &gt;&gt; Say, I acknowledge the flaw. &gt;&gt; I acknowledge the sticky nature. It isn't that I just cave in say, well, that's the way I am. I got a temper. and I can't do anything about it. It's not that the life that is in you is greater than that temper, greater than that temptation, you know, but you may not ever get rid of you will never get rid of the temptation. And we got things that are, you know, we each want to have little quirks. &gt;&gt; I guess I'm the only one. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. not praise the Lord that we all have quirks, but we do have. And after speaking, he said he probably tore up waste baskets full of scrap paper and he gave the world a masterpiece when he was sitting in his study. Under the inspiration, notice under the inspiration, God was so inspired, he spoke, "This is my beloved son. There is none other. This is my beloved son in whom I'm pleased to dwell. This is my beloved son. Here he on the cross when he saw that image, that perfect son paying the price, he struck him and said, "Speak. He did speak and that blood is speaking. &gt;&gt; Now &gt;&gt; listen while I come to a close &gt;&gt; and he he he got under under inspiration and he write something down and he go into a study and pray it wasn't right. He'd scrap it and throw it in the basket waste basket. Look at the earth was filled with violence and men and women they just didn't even get married. Men took women and the earth was filled with violence &gt;&gt; and it was filled with pleasure and God, the Bible says God repented himself. They even made the earth. What did he do? He took it that first creation and crumbled it all up and got throw this in the waste basket. &gt;&gt; And all the time down through the centuries, man, even Israel, they failed. went into bondage, corrupted themselves, bowed down to images, bowed down to false gods, offered their children, and burnt them. &gt;&gt; Now, that's something, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I've never been able to understand that. Burnt their own children and offered them to some false empty god. &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's deception. &gt;&gt; That's deception. But even then, God would not give up on Israel. &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of a flaw you have. I don't care how much bondage you've gone into. I don't care what kind of sins you've committed. You are the people of God. And you will bring forth a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? &gt;&gt; God's not going to give up on you. You may give up on yourself. God will not give up on you. And even if you went and and went off by yourself, God, the Holy Spirit is going to keep he's going to keep penetrating your mind and your soul. &gt;&gt; And he will bring back to remembrance the things that you've heard. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He will not surrender up. He will not give up on that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He got so inspired that finally Apostle Paul said, "Thou Lord, in the beginning you laid the foundation of the earth &gt;&gt; and the heavens are the work of thy hands and they shall perish. &gt;&gt; You'll crumple them up. You'll throw them in a waste basket. But thou remainest. You're the same. And they shall wax old as doth a garment. And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall, and they shall be changed, but thou art the same, and your years fail not. And no wonder through the apostle John, he'll cry out in Revelations, "And he that sat on the throne said, &gt;&gt; "This is the one who shed the blood, he said, &gt;&gt; behold." Attention people. Attention. Clover day Bible way. I make all things new. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You're destined for a new body. &gt;&gt; You're destined for a new home. &gt;&gt; You're destined for a new city. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's your destination. [Applause] And if you don't have any sense of going there, you may not rejoice over it. But I'll tell you, for people that have been looking for it and longing for it, and that's why God says, "You're my son. You're my daughter. You believe me. [Music] I've been 10 minutes. I will just be five. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to quit wherever. Even I'm in the middle of a word. I'm going to quit. Do you know why God got so inspired? because he saw in that he saw in that life that was coming. God is his knowledge isn't merely immense. His knowledge is infinite. &gt;&gt; He saw the church coming forth. He saw the martyrs suffering for him. He saw the reformation. He saw Luther and say, "I cannot recant. &gt;&gt; I won't give up." Amen. &gt;&gt; He saw him standing against that great harlot church &gt;&gt; and he saw the reformers and he saw the messenger. &gt;&gt; Here comes one, &gt;&gt; don't get me wrong, like him. &gt;&gt; This vessel, he's like Moses &gt;&gt; has slow, cumbersome speech. He can't express himself. But he believes me. &gt;&gt; He even write a letter to me &gt;&gt; and nailed it on a tree. He believes me. He believes I'm here. He believes I'm in the woods. He believes I'm alive. &gt;&gt; He believes I'm resurrected. And God saw him coming out of that blood. &gt;&gt; And he was so inspired. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll let him fulfill Luke 17:30. &gt;&gt; I'll let the very life of my son issue out through him and I'll give him signs and I'll work wonders through him. I'll let him tell the people the secret of their heart like my son did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and he needs a flaw. &gt;&gt; I'll let his parents serve and worship the very harlot system &gt;&gt; that he is so going to fight against. &gt;&gt; I'll let them be overcome by alcohol. The very demon that will take his life some completely under the influence in a drunken stouper and drive a car and smash head on in and let him lose his life. His lips will be sealed. I will allow that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But he will never heir &gt;&gt; in his vision. &gt;&gt; He will be another one that will hold to his vision. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this church, I have been looking back not over the last year, the last two years, over the last 30 years and and and all the things that may happen in your life. But I look back and I say, God, what was your vision? Your vision shall be my vision. What did you intend here? Why did you raise us up to get this message out? Then thus shall it be. &gt;&gt; This congregation of people will hear me preach according to the initial vision. You've been raised up to be witnesses of this end time message. God was so inspired at the thought that this vision that this vision would be fulfilled. That's one of the reasons he struck him. &gt;&gt; I haven't time but I must conclude with this. Now, here comes this messenger and he meets seven angels and he goes back to speak, Brother Randy, Sister Lori, and you from Arizona, Brother Wes, your wife and daughter Jessica, you from Arizona, others perhaps. Isn't it amazing? Of all the earth, God chose a spot out in that desert. &gt;&gt; And he was so inspired. And there are things that have been sealed up since the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And his son is hanging on the cross. His son is a beaten mass of humanity. But he sees that there's going to be secrets that are going to be made known to a people. And it must be made known. This blood must speak. Speak. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And after the prophet of God had that visitation, he came back and he said, he spoke in the seals, the opening of the seals, he said, "I was so inspired." &gt;&gt; Sometimes hardly knowing what he's saying, &gt;&gt; but he's so inspired because it had to reveal Jesus Christ now &gt;&gt; and had to tell the people. had to have a vessel. So inspired, &gt;&gt; I'll show him on the other side. I'll take him beyond the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; So inspired, I'll show this messenger the bodies these people are going to live in. &gt;&gt; That's why he said, I saw you all there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You tell that devil. You tell that evil one coming by to whisper in your ear, "I've heard different things &gt;&gt; than what you're telling me. &gt;&gt; I've heard eternal things. &gt;&gt; You cannot You cannot impose this on me and you cannot impede my walk with God. &gt;&gt; I reject you &gt;&gt; and I reject your voice because I've heard another voice." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "If there was ever anything, if I've ever said anything that was inspired, it was in that &gt;&gt; immediately after the angels of the Lord appeared and about the seven seals." And I was to return back immediately after that. He said here to Jeffersonville and preach the seven seals. And I'm not just closing on a quiet quiet note. if I've ever said anything, he said to thousands of people, he said to the blind man in India, he told me about that and he said there was tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people and I've been in that church and stood behind the chair chair chair that or the table rather that he stood. He told me this man had been a sun worshipper and his eyes had been burned out by worshiping the sun. You think you have a physical problem? Think of this one. And his eyes had been burned out. And brother Brandham said as he stood there, he's in two worlds. and he looks and he sees the sideburns are black, real black. But in the vision, he sees it that there's a little gray hair. See how accurate it was? A little gray hair in it. So he said, "I knew he was going to receive his sight." But he says, "Then I needed to exercise my my faith that it would happen right then and called for his healing." Thus sayeth the Lord. And the place went into pandemonium. They were trying to pull pieces of his suit and his pants off so they have a piece of cloth. They had to have the the ushers and the people try to protect him. And that man went screaming, his eyes perfect. He said, he said he saw that he would he saw him and turn his head and look and he said, "I I saw that he had his sight." And now he he he speaks sight for that person. He what he's saying here is what he spoke to you and I under the opening of God's word is greater than giving that man his sight. &gt;&gt; Is greater than all the supernatural. friends. &gt;&gt; He went up on a mountain like Moses went up on a mountain, but he came down and he has a word &gt;&gt; that's been left us. That's why I am consumed. Don't think it's just myself personally. I'm consumed. If there's anything in me, I want to be getting this word to every last elected seed. I've told you many times and I say may it be a theme of this church what we want to be able to do when we meet him when we go and meet him our Lord Jesus when we meet the messenger cuz we'll be gathered to the people of our age when we meet him you want to be able to look in his face and say brother Brandham we did what we could &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; we had a little fellow up maybe not much of a preacher not deep and all of these things but he told us he wanted to just do what he Good. &gt;&gt; And that's what we doing. &gt;&gt; God bless you people. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Your flaw is valuable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The value of your of the flaw. May God ever make this in your forefront of your mind. Oh, hallelujah. I'd like to have you stand with me. And we'll sing my favorite, brother Ryan. It's You had the mind of God. I couldn't believe it. I just walked into the study and I heard you singing. I that sounds so familiar. I went and turned the volume up and you were singing blessed assurance and I just started to cry like a baby. I said, "Oh God, here I've got the woman's picture up here. I'm going to talk about her life and he's singing one of her most famous songs and one of my favorites of all time. I'll ask you to join with me and sing it as the redeemed." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you and thanks sister Debbie. I I took a lot of uh I just took a lot of uh what do we call it allowance here and I trust you won't mind. God bless you. Tell your sister and her husband I send greetings to them.

[Music] I'm going to ask you brother Timothy Anoco if you would come up please pray a prayer of blessing upon this church. Brother Timothy Anookco and his wife Sister Shantel, their children Paul and I believe Michelle Michael, I'm not too sure just how they pronounce it flew his family here second or third time I've been here and I'm just going to give you this. He didn't. He wanted to be sure that he was in the mind of God. So they flew over here without any announcement that they're coming. And he said, "If brother Biscll isn't there, then I know that my plan is not of God. He arrived. I was here. I'll phone his home. And if his wife indicates he's too busy, then I will I will understand. My plan is not to go ahead. [Music] And I and she said, "Well, my husband would like to see you." So we met here that and he held in his heart, "If brother Bis is too busy to have the kind of meeting I need to have, then I will take that." The third thing he had in his heart, I will take that as this is not the will of God. I said, "We have time." We were going to be with our brother Gerard and sister Angela, but I said we'll take Sunday afternoon and come and however time, 2 hours. Will that be fine? Yes, that'll be fine. We sat together. He tells me due to circumstances, I want to leave my wife and my family here to fellowship in this church and perhaps the children would go to the school. and he says,"I will need to find a place. I will need a three-bedroom home. I will need this." He began to make the requirements down. I just want to say to this church, "When you see Sister Shantel and her son Paul and daughter Michael Michelle, they came on vacation and left the family here. I would like the church to take it upon your heart to pray for them and say, "God, if there's anything I can do and but they were well able, they've already looked at several places and got something in mind and have looked at furniture. I can tell you they haven't wasted any time just here on a few days of vacation." And I I I feel humbled and I trust the congregation understand. I feel very humbled that a very qualified man he's an executive in a large company but feels something in his heart. I want my family in this particular South Africa's got wonderful churches and many wonderful pastors but his circumstances were such and now they're just entering into a burden and I pray brother Timothy God with you. He has to fly out about July the 2nd or thereabouts and has to go back to work and Sister Shantel and the family will be staying here. Invite her and make friends and let her know that this is a family and we do everything we can, Sister Shantel, support you and the children and be friendly with you and pray for you. And brother Timothy, God bless you. So this brother Timothy on a Tokco I believe some friends came from Edmonton. There's a family from Edmonton. Did you come from Edmonton? Some came from Edmonton down. All right there. God bless you. I just see some faces we didn't recognize right away. God bless you. I see this family here. God bless you. Lovely to have you. Come, brother Timothy. Would you please? This is my story. This is my song. Praising my father. This is my story. [Music] This is my song. Praising my s [Music] Lord Jesus, I believe that is the very very reason we are here to praise you Lord &gt;&gt; all the day long &gt;&gt; and what we have been hearing this morning Lord what kind of weakness we have. You saw it before, but you predestinated us to be your children to receive the message at the end of the time. No one has a plan before to accept the message. But we thank you for that. Thank you Lord for everything that has been spoken. Bless brother Ed. Bless the church. And God, you know what they are trying to do to encourage the bride of Jesus Christ across the world. Missionary, streaming and whatever I can imagine. Lord, we say thank you. Bless everyone that has come this morning. And as we are departing from this place, Lord, I pray that your spirit departed with us. And as we are coming this evening, bring us back and speak tonight and again through right at home and be with us for the rest of the life. We pray in Jesus Christ's name and for your glory. Amen. [Music] with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to dismiss you because we've been let along. I remember that the giving your giving is part of worship is that you've been in here worshiping and brother brother Toby he gave us a he gave us a little talk on on giving. I I thought that was wonderful. Thanks, brother Toby. I've heard many people refer to it and he said it's actually part of worship. So he said when you come in the door you're coming into worship. So, first give give your offering and then come into worship. We've always done it the other way. However you do it, I don't care. But we need you. We appreciate you. I do very, very much appreciate your strength, your attention, your attendance. And now remember the Lord in your giving. And God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
