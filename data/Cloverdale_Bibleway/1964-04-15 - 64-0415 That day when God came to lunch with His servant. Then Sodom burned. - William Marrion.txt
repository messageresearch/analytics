TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now there's been a day when that son Rose back there in the beginning a s o n of God came on the earth now he's promised again in the evening time now we've had a dismal date we've had great meetings we've healed the sick we've had great times and we have made organizations and schools and hospitals and seminaries which is all right just a dismal day but he promised just before the Night Comes it shall be light now Jesus said in St Luke the 17th chapter he said as it was in the days of Sodom now listen close I'm closing as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man we all know that now he read the same Bible in Genesis that we read and what's the setting in Sodom now at Sodom there was three classes of people people there's always three places of people that's Believers make Believers and unbelievers now here was Abraham his name had been changed from Abram to Abraham which meant father of Nations and he couldn't have the baby as long as his name was Abram it had to be changed to Abraham for ham does mean father of Nations now notice father to the Nations I notice the scene has never been said in all the world like it is right now now we see everything exactly in the line of Sodom if you don't believe it take off your Shades from your eyes and walk out look on the street each day look the newspapers wherever you wish to it's a Sodom and Zach and there was lot down in Sodom but here was Abraham was elected the one with the promise he he wasn't in Sodom he didn't go down there he was called out now there's three groups of people there was a genuine believer and there was a the lukewarm which Any teacher will tell you that lot represented the nominal Church which was in Sodom and there was a sodomite man now notice just before the they were Abraham and lot was looking for a promised miraculous son is that right is that what the church is looking for today a return of this son amen Jesus Christ the son of God we're looking for him to come now look at the position everybody will admit she's in a Sodom condition I passed over California here the other day and got a hold of a magazine or paper r or homosexuals had in increased 60% in the last year oh my it's pitiful see it's just because women istill themselves away that's right and it's on the street naked and it's just it's just a shame but the Bible said they'd be that way and even to men it's just they they're changed see it's going to get worse and another another if the world would stand another 50 years the whole world will be totally insane look at the sanity from 40 from 20 years ago to this time now look at the setting here's Abraham the elected called out here now and there's lock down in Sodom and Three Angels came up two angels went down in to talk to lot and they preached the word and tried to get lot out of there is that right but this one has stayed behind with Abraham he didn't try to get Abraham out of anything because he was already out see he was out but watch what kind of a sign he done now look he was sitting with his back turned to the tent and Sarah was in the tent behind he had never seen her yet and remember just a day or two before that his name was Abram and her she was Saria and now she's Sarah a r ah H he's a b r a h a m he said Abraham where is your wife Sarah s a r a h said she's in the tent behind you he said I'm going to visit you according to the time of life I looked for that child for 25 years she's nearly 100 now he is 100 she's 90 said said I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and you're going to have that son and Sarah she kind of laughed you know to herself she said me an old woman see as we're mixed audience but you know what I mean is man and wife family relation had been years and years and years past you see because he was 100 and she was 90 well Street said me have pleasure with my Lord Abraham and him being old too see and then this man with his back turned to the tent said why did Abraham why did Sarah laugh in the tent saying these things couldn't be Abraham called him Elohim that was God Elohim is a is a self-existing one see they're all sufficient self-existing in the beginning God take that word God look at it back here same translated the same thing Elohim so there was Elohim manifested in flesh that eat the flesh of a calf drinking the milk from the cow and eat bread and set talking to Abraham and Abraham knew that he could discern what was in Sarah's thoughts back there and that's the reason he know that was Elohim amen Jesus said notice in the days when the son of man shall be revealed being revealed in the last days it'll be like it was in the days of Sodom God manifested in his church the human beings revealing himself see in human flesh like he was then now look I want to ask you something in all of the ages since the church first began they have never had a messenger to him that his name ended with h m to now g r a h a m right down there call him out Oral Roberts biling Graham see h a.m there's been Moody sanky fny Wesley Billy Sundy all them see International Church like that World Church V there never been one ending to hm or right now and that's Billy Graham see that's six letters g r a h a m six meaning the man was born created on the sixth date six is man's number there he is to the church natural Abraham is a b r a h a m seven letters see look at the setting of the day and look what's taking place Abraham had seen many signs and wonders and everything that God had done so has the church you've received the Holy Ghost spoken tongues done all these signs and wonders but your promised as it was then so shall it be again it shall be light in the evening time Jesus Christ the same same son will appear again on the scene any his church and will do the same thing that he did then showing that he is the word made manifest amen see knowing the secret that's in the heart revealing and doing the things that he's supposed to do that's exactly the word of God we're getting late so let's bow our heads just a moment as we look to him and ask him to confirm his word
