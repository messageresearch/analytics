[24:19] glory. You are everything to us.
[24:23] We speak about grace, Lord. We have

[24:28] favor. We don't deserve it. We are still
[24:31] unworthy of it, but we receive it. We

[24:36] hearts. Thank you, wonderful Savior.
[24:39] Thank you for redemption, Lord. WE'RE
[24:41] HERE TO CELEBRATE YOUR LIFE THIS
[24:43] MORNING. IT IS NOT US. IT IS YOU. THIS
[24:46] IS NOT OUR WORK. THIS IS YOUR WORK. This
[24:50] is not anything that we've done. WE JUST
[24:52] SURRENDER. WE JUST YIELD. We just let
[24:55] you have your way. BUT WE DO WANT YOU TO
[24:58] HAVE YOUR WAY. We do want YOU TO HAVE

[25:09] in the sanctuary.

[25:14] you, Father. We speak to you FROM OUR
[25:16] HEARTS. WE LOVE YOUR APPEARING. We love
[25:19] what YOU'VE DONE IN THE PAST. We love
[25:21] what you're doing today. WE LOOK FORWARD
[25:23] to the future, Father. But Lord, we just
[25:26] want to be in your spirit right now.
[25:28] [music] Many have come this morning. Our
[25:30] hearts have been looking forward to this
[25:32] day. Communion, footwashing, many coming
[25:35] up from Seattle and Tacoma in the areas
[25:38] and our hearts are waiting before you
[25:40] for communion. Us speaking to you and
[25:43] you speaking back. There's needs among
[25:45] us, Father. This is the house of prayer.
[25:48] This is the house of deliverance. This
[25:50] is a house of healing. This is the place
[25:53] where miracles happen. This is the place
[25:55] where your word is lifted up. This is
[25:57] the place where your thoughts are lifted
[26:00] up beyond our own thoughts. Man is not
[26:02] GLORIFIED HERE. YOU ARE GLORIFIED. So
[26:05] would you receive victory by touching
[26:07] lives, breaking down walls, delivering
[26:11] lives that are bound, filling us with
[26:13] the Holy Spirit, even myself. FATHER, WE
[26:16] DESIRE a fresh baptism today. Your
[26:19] spirit to come among us. Move out across
[26:22] the lines to our sister MARGE MILLER.
[26:25] SHE'S CALLED IN. SHE BELIEVES. We
[26:27] believe with her. May the Holy Spirit
[26:30] come into the room. MAY THE POWER OF GOD
[26:32] DESCEND THROUGH OUR SISTER'S BODY. ALLOW
[26:35] her to take in food and be strengthened.
[26:37] Oh God, TOUCH HER. LORD JESUS, WE
[26:40] believe you're still the same yesterday,
[26:43] today, and forever. You haven't changed.
[26:46] Times have changed. LEODYSIA WANTS US TO
[26:49] CHANGE, BUT WE WILL NOT CHANGE WHEN IT
[26:52] COMES TO YOUR WORD. WE WILL DIE
[26:54] BELIEVING YOUR WORD IS TRUE. IT IS
[26:57] NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. Let our hearts BE
[26:59] FULL OF FAITH THIS morning that you're
[27:02] moving beyond what we can see. There's a
[27:04] realm that you're moving in. There's a
[27:06] realm, there's a dimension that we need
[27:08] TO OUR FAITH TO COME UP INTO.
[27:11] Forgive us of our sins, Lord. Forgive us
[27:14] of our iniquities. We're asking for
[27:17] grace this morning. We're asking for
[27:19] mercy.
[27:21] [music] We're asking for your hand to be
[27:24] upon each life, tenderizing us. Father,
[27:28] let us be lost in your SPIRIT TODAY. OUR
[27:31] PASTORS coming to bring the word. We're
[27:33] getting ready to step into another
[27:35] dimension. THESE TIMES ARE THE MOST
[27:37] IMPORTANT TIMES OF OUR LIVES. WE WANT TO
[27:40] enter in with the right attitude. Our
[27:43] hearts humble, God, to you and TO ONE
[27:46] ANOTHER. WE'RE NOT looking around. We're
[27:48] not looking to others. We need you this
[27:50] morning. We pray for our brother Terry
[27:53] John Tatch and this test that he's about
[27:56] TO ENTER INTO. WHAT YOU'VE done for
[27:58] brother Rod, WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR HIS
[27:59] SONS. May our brother John, may he be
[28:02] rested. Let his mind be refreshed. Let
[28:05] him be ready. And may he do his part and
[28:08] may you come and do your part. MAY THERE
[28:11] BE A TESTIMONY, LORD, THAT YOU MOVED ON
[28:13] his behalf. You heard the prayers of the
[28:16] body. We believe with him. Lord, our
[28:19] sister Patty's mother might not make it
[28:21] through this day. Lord,
[28:24] you've been speaking to her family.
[28:26] Sister Patty's been a testimony. I pray
[28:29] right now the Holy Spirit would come
[28:30] inside of the room. Her mother's made
[28:33] her heart right with you. She's ready to
[28:35] go. I pray for the family, our sister
[28:38] Patty, Sister Kayla, that the comforting
[28:41] spirit of your presence would move into
[28:43] their hearts. May the peace of God that
[28:46] passes even our understanding be their
[28:49] portion.
[28:51] [music] and for other needs. Jesus,
[28:53] unspoken requests, hands were lifted up,
[28:56] hearts are waiting on you for direction
[28:59] and leadership. Our counsel comes from
[29:02] your word and what you say, we want it
[29:05] to be brought to pass in our lives. We
[29:08] give you this day, Lord. [music]
[29:10] We love you and we desire to love you
[29:12] more. So, just come by this place, this
[29:15] sacred place, and meet with us. We
[29:18] invite you now. And those on the
[29:21] internet, those on the phone hook up
[29:23] maybe needy in their body need a touch
[29:25] from you. Would you minister to them
[29:28] also in Jesus name?
[29:31] Amen. [music]
[29:36] &gt;&gt; And you may be seated.
[29:52] I want to welcome welcome everyone who's
[29:55] visiting with us today. Brother Jeremy,
[29:58] brother Aaron, and brother uh John have
[30:01] a special force. Why don't you come at
[30:02] this time? Get ready. Um well, we
[30:05] welcome uh everyone. And if you're here
[30:07] and and are visiting, we're just real
[30:09] happy to have you here with us. Um, we
[30:13] want to uh I got a note here from
[30:14] Brother Randy Snow and uh we want to
[30:17] officially welcome them into the church.
[30:18] He says he wanted to pass on thanks to
[30:21] everyone that helped uh to move their
[30:23] stuff. Um, and maybe we get Brother
[30:27] Randy, Sister Lori, Amanda,
[30:31] Jessica, Melissa, and Ryan to stand up
[30:33] wherever you're hiding.
[30:37] There they are.
[30:44] and they're uh they're officially here
[30:46] in the church now. So, I want to make
[30:47] sure everyone makes them real welcome.
[30:49] Randy is uh got the same kind of
[30:51] philosophy of life I had. You know, when
[30:53] I was a couple years ago, uh I think I
[30:56] was 47 or 48. My wife gave me a little
[30:58] plaque and said, "If you don't grow up
[31:00] by the time you reach age 50, you don't
[31:02] have to." And I hit 50 and I haven't
[31:04] yet. So, uh and Ry's kind of got the
[31:06] same philosophy as me. And uh so if you
[31:09] see, you know, me getting in trouble,
[31:11] it's probably Ry's fault. Um we want to
[31:14] be like little children, don't we? Did
[31:16] Jesus say we're supposed to be like
[31:17] little children? Amen. And uh we
[31:20] appreciate having Brother Randy and
[31:22] Sister Lori and the family here at the
[31:23] church, brothers.

[38:30] Amen. We're here to worship at his feet.
[38:34] Want to welcome you all in the name of
[38:36] the Lord Jesus Christ as you have
[38:38] already been welcomed.
[38:40] And we're going to go quickly to the
[38:42] word, but I like you to be very mindful
[38:46] that I believe it's been announced
[38:48] already. When I say I believe, it's
[38:50] because our our our sound is not we're
[38:53] doing work up here and our sound is not
[38:55] coming through to the minister study.
[38:58] So, uh I I can only take it from the uh
[39:02] from the monitor and then I guess what's
[39:05] happening. Uh but uh this Wednesday is
[39:10] uh there's no service Wednesday and it's
[39:12] been put off till Friday because we have
[39:14] our brother Derek Donaldson from
[39:17] Auckland, New Zealand. Brother
[39:19] Donaldson, those of you that have heard
[39:21] our brother Donaldson before, we've been
[39:23] so blessed by his ministry each time he
[39:25] has been able to visit us. And he's a
[39:28] man I have a great deal of confidence
[39:30] in. Great deal of confidence. I've known
[39:32] him for a lot of years and he speaks
[39:35] from the very depth of his heart. He has
[39:39] a great burden and vision for other
[39:42] countries and the missions and God has
[39:44] used him. Uh we really respect him. Uh
[39:49] that's sister Anne Zeller's father and
[39:53] uh I believe sister
[39:56] uh sister Donaldson is here also. So, we
[39:59] just want to welcome them and welcome
[40:02] our brother Donaldson to the pulpit.
[40:04] He'll be speaking Friday and both
[40:06] services on next Sunday. I just want him
[40:09] to speak. You know what I do is I see
[40:12] how God is moving another part of the
[40:14] world and I know it's very very God is
[40:17] doing the same thing all over. Amen. We
[40:20] just want to be a part of everything
[40:22] that he's doing.
[40:24] Uh I'm going to have you turn in your
[40:27] Bibles to uh John the 15th chapter and
[40:31] then we're going to read from Romans 11.
[40:35] So uh if you'll just turn to John 15.
[40:39] And before we read, I would like to just
[40:45] have a word of prayer.
[41:01] Join with me in prayer. And we want to
[41:04] remember our brother Madden,
[41:06] uh, Brother Madden's father.
[41:09] He's still in the hospital in intensive
[41:12] care.
[41:13] And that's our brother Jedamir's
[41:15] father-in-law, his wife's dad, and
[41:18] brother and and sister uh
[41:22] uh sister Dena, her father.
[41:27] Our dear Lord Jesus,
[41:29] we are coming to you
[41:32] in that name that's above every name.
[41:35] That name at which our hearts even now
[41:38] bow in respect. Oh God, our heads are
[41:42] bowed to the soil from when once we have
[41:44] come. We realize that we are so helpless
[41:48] at times of great need. And we know that
[41:52] all life really truly rests in your
[41:55] hand. And so before we even turn to the
[41:58] word, we'd like to remember, oh God,
[42:00] that brother Madden's dad, his sister's
[42:04] father as well. And I pray, oh God, and
[42:08] for his mother that you will cause
[42:11] faith, that perfect faith to be in their
[42:15] hearts now. And that you shall raise our
[42:19] brother up, oh God. Stabilize his heart.
[42:24] Speak to his heart, oh God. And may his
[42:27] heart not be troubled anymore. I pray. I
[42:30] pray that it'll stabilize and he'll be
[42:32] strengthened. and we ask for it in the
[42:35] name of Jesus Christ. May the power of
[42:38] the resurrected Lord Jesus be his
[42:41] portion today. Oh God, I ask Father
[42:44] you'll bless us especially now as we
[42:47] just turn to your word. Anoint our eyes
[42:50] as we read our hearts and minds to
[42:54] receive. And above all things, may the
[42:56] Holy Spirit reveal the context and the
[43:00] content. bless the people, Lord, each
[43:03] one in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[43:11] I'm going to read from uh the first
[43:13] verse uh just down through verse
[43:17] two and three, I believe it is.
[43:21] I am the true vine, and my father is the
[43:24] husbandman.
[43:25] Every branch in me that beareth not
[43:28] fruit, he taketh away, and every branch
[43:32] that beareth fruit, he purgth it, that
[43:35] it may bring forth more fruit. Now ye
[43:39] are clean through the word which I have
[43:42] spoken unto you. Abide in me and I in
[43:45] you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
[43:49] itself except it abide in the vine, no
[43:52] more can ye except ye abide in me.
[43:56] Turn also please to Romans the 11th
[44:00] chapter.
[44:02] Now Jesus is speaking here individually
[44:04] of the branches dwelling in the vine.
[44:09] Paul now is speaking about the whole
[44:12] nation of Israel and the Gentiles.
[44:16] and he has them likened to
[44:19] uh a vine. The vine the original vine
[44:24] being Israel and the branches that have
[44:27] been grafted in as the Gentiles. So just
[44:31] to keep that in your mind now
[44:34] um we'll start at verse 13
[44:38] of 11 of Romans. For I speak to you
[44:41] Gentiles, in as much as I am the apostle
[44:43] of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office,
[44:47] if by any means I may provoke to
[44:49] emulation them which are my flesh, and
[44:52] might save some of them. For if the
[44:55] casting away of them, that's the Jews,
[44:58] be the reconciling of the world, because
[45:01] the gospel went to the Gentiles, what
[45:03] shall the receiving of them be, or the
[45:06] gathering back of them, but life from
[45:08] the dead, which can be nothing other
[45:10] than the resurrection?
[45:11] For if the first fruit be holy, the lump
[45:14] is also holy. And if the root be holy,
[45:17] so are the branches. And if some of the
[45:20] branches be broken off, and thou the
[45:24] Gentiles, being a wild olive tree, were
[45:27] grafted in among them, and with them
[45:30] partakest of the root, and the fatness
[45:33] of the olive tree, boast not against the
[45:37] branches. But if thou boast, thou beest
[45:40] not the root, but the root thee. Thou
[45:44] will say then, the branches were broken
[45:47] off, that I might be grafted in. Well,
[45:50] because of unbelief, they were broken
[45:53] off, and thou standest by faith, be not
[45:57] high minded, but fear. [clears throat]
[46:00] For if God spared not the natural
[46:02] branches, take heed, lest he also spare
[46:06] thee not. Behold therefore the goodness
[46:10] and the severity of God on them which
[46:13] fell severity but toward thee goodness
[46:16] if thou continue in his goodness.
[46:20] Otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
[46:24] And they also if they abide not still in
[46:27] unbelief shall be grafted in. For God is
[46:31] able to graft them in again.
[46:36] Uh, for if thou w cut off, I'm sorry,
[46:39] for if thou w cut out of the olive tree,
[46:42] which is wild by nature, and were
[46:45] grafted contrary to nature into a good
[46:48] olive tree, how shall how much more
[46:52] shall these which be the natural
[46:54] branches be grafted into their own olive
[46:57] tree? For I would not, brethren, that
[47:01] you should be ignorant of this mystery,
[47:03] lest you should be wise in your own
[47:05] conceits, that blindness in part is
[47:09] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[47:12] the Gentiles become in. Amen. God bless
[47:15] you. You may have your seats. We are
[47:18] certainly in uh remarkable time that
[47:22] we're living in right now and fullness
[47:26] of the Gentiles. I tell you when we have
[47:28] received the last messenger
[47:31] uh to the gentile age we are are
[47:34] certainly there we've certainly arrived
[47:36] there now I would like to
[47:40] just set in motion the service set your
[47:43] thoughts in in line if you can stay with
[47:46] me now
[47:49] Paul the apostle
[47:52] and brother Brandham as a last messenger
[47:55] they both spoke on a national and
[47:58] international
[48:00] level and also individually. They would
[48:04] speak to the individual but they spoke
[48:07] on the a national level and so uh they
[48:11] would speak and say certain thing not
[48:14] being specific but this kind of
[48:16] condition will exist this kind of thing
[48:18] will happen but not come down to
[48:21] specific details of how that may take
[48:24] place. You know, we can say, well, until
[48:26] the fullness of the Gentiles come in.
[48:28] Fine. But how what will take place? What
[48:31] kind of events will happen so that we
[48:34] would know that the fullness of the
[48:36] Gentiles has come in? When is that going
[48:38] to arrive? What will be the climactic
[48:41] event? What will be the events that will
[48:43] lead up to it? You see, and uh so
[48:46] there's there's all kinds of perhaps
[48:48] background. Now, here we are. We're
[48:50] living day to day and we see the news
[48:53] and hear the things that are taking
[48:55] place and see the conditions that are
[48:57] around us and naturally uh we we we you
[49:01] know we we we're just all taken up with
[49:05] what we are facing with day by day by
[49:08] day but I find that a messenger will uh
[49:12] he will get to give one encompassing
[49:14] statement and it involves a whole lot of
[49:18] smaller things and we may get lost in
[49:20] the details. We may get so lost in the
[49:23] details that we don't really see what is
[49:25] happening.
[49:27] Now, uh Jesus was speaking about the
[49:30] nature of the life in the vine. And so,
[49:32] I'd like to speak on an individual basis
[49:35] here for a few moments on an individual
[49:39] uh the life that was in the vine. and uh
[49:42] uh and how uh Paul is speaking of how
[49:46] God's dealings with Israel was. Uh Jesus
[49:51] said, "I am the vine and you're the
[49:54] branches." Brother Brandham refers to
[49:56] that and says, "And the life that's in
[49:59] the vine goes into the branch to bear
[50:01] the fruit, fruit bearers, and every limb
[50:05] that doesn't bring forth good fruit is
[50:07] heed off in the token." And I'll be
[50:11] referring to some of the things he said
[50:13] in the token. He said, "If that first
[50:15] branch came forth, that branch out of
[50:18] that vine that wrote a book of Acts
[50:21] behind it, if that vine ever puts forth
[50:24] another branch, they'll write another
[50:27] book of Acts behind it because it's the
[50:32] same life." And that's the significant
[50:35] statement because it's the same life in
[50:39] the confirmation of the commission in
[50:41] that message. He said he doesn't bear
[50:44] the fruit. That is Jesus doesn't bear
[50:47] the fruit. He said but he energizes you
[50:52] and I. We're the fruit bearers. You are
[50:56] the fruit bearers. We receive the Holy
[50:59] Spirit so we can be fruit bearers. It's
[51:02] not God that bears the fruit. He
[51:05] energizes us and we bear the fruit. He
[51:08] says, and he says, "And he energizes you
[51:11] and I that we could understand one
[51:13] another
[51:15] and through voices that he speaks to
[51:17] us." He's referring to his own ministry
[51:20] there. And does his work to confirm the
[51:22] commission that we're sent to do because
[51:24] he was speaking about confirmation of
[51:26] his commission.
[51:29] Other branches can be grafted in. I'm
[51:31] just my own notes now. But will only
[51:35] produce their own fruit.
[51:37] You can take an orange or a citrus
[51:40] plant. And he says you can take a citrus
[51:42] tree like an orange and you can take a
[51:44] limb off of a grapefruit
[51:47] and uh split a little place in the
[51:49] orange tree and put in a grapefruit.
[51:51] It'll grow. It'll grow grapefruits. my
[51:55] uncle down in Seattle who's passed away
[51:58] now and he had a pear tree and he had
[52:02] several varieties of pears growing on
[52:05] that tree and each branch was bearing
[52:08] its own special type of pear and it was
[52:11] just so remarkable. I hadn't actually
[52:13] seen it. Brother Brandon was talking
[52:15] about having seen it and as long as
[52:18] they're like in the same line a citrus
[52:20] fruit, it would grow tangelos and
[52:23] grapefruits and lemons and so on. But
[52:26] it's thriving on the real vine. But now,
[52:30] Apostle Paul is talking about an olive
[52:33] uh a natural olive and then the wild
[52:35] olive being grafted into it and
[52:37] receiving of that same life that's in in
[52:40] the vine. Now I want to just draw your
[52:44] attention to the nature. The nature I'd
[52:47] like to dwell on that for it'll be more
[52:49] or less the kind of the theme and and
[52:52] the subject this morning is really quite
[52:54] broad. And so I pray that God will give
[52:57] you understanding and give me the uh
[52:59] ability to bring it to you as he has
[53:02] brought it to me. The nature of the
[53:05] branch and the word that is used for
[53:09] nature in the scripture is not only the
[53:12] nature of things but the force and the
[53:17] laws the order of nature. Now I want to
[53:21] quickly because of the move of God
[53:23] that's been happening amongst our young
[53:25] people. I want them to especially listen
[53:28] because you were born and came into the
[53:32] world by natural birth and you have a
[53:35] natural you have a nature. Now that
[53:38] nature needs to be developed and that is
[53:42] the task of our parents as parents and
[53:46] that is why it's so important to have
[53:47] godly parents. So godly parents can
[53:51] develop that nature. But there's
[53:53] something else. We all have something in
[53:55] our natures. Every person has something
[53:58] in their nature that they wish they
[53:59] didn't have. We'd like to rid ourselves
[54:02] of certain things in our nature. And I
[54:04] won't I won't uh belabor that point, but
[54:08] that is so I believe that is so. I've
[54:10] never met anybody but what saw some flaw
[54:14] or weakness or something in their nature
[54:16] and they just wish they didn't have it.
[54:18] Well, there is another nature and that's
[54:22] called the divine nature. And the
[54:24] scriptures very specific and very
[54:27] powerfully state that by the promises of
[54:30] God, we become partakers of the divine
[54:34] nature of God. That nature is in it is
[54:39] infinitely more powerful than the nature
[54:42] which you received by your natural
[54:44] birth. in fact is it over not only
[54:47] overpowers that nature but it it can it
[54:51] takes some qual it takes some things I
[54:53] would need to qualify that statement we
[54:55] must be yielded people we must yield to
[54:58] the Holy Spirit because God's not going
[55:00] to force it on us as we partake of the
[55:05] word of God as we believe it and as we
[55:09] believe it we become uh recipients of
[55:13] the divine nature
[55:15] And if we will just yield and remain in
[55:17] that atmosphere of God. That's why
[55:20] brother Brandham speaks about the
[55:22] prophets that went out into the
[55:23] wilderness. He said they stayed SO LONG
[55:26] IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD TILL I mean they
[55:29] were they were they came back with the
[55:31] word of God
[55:33] &gt;&gt; and they were called gods because they
[55:36] received the word of God and they
[55:38] remained so long in the presence of God
[55:40] that they were they were godlike people.
[55:43] And I can tell you if you and I remain
[55:46] in the presence of God and that Holy
[55:48] Spirit just keeps infusing us, you will
[55:52] go out into the world and you'll be
[55:54] you'll be a a a God person.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And that nature will find its place in
[56:02] you. Even the spiritual nature needs to
[56:05] be developed. And we can either give
[56:08] ourselves to our natural nature or give
[56:11] ourselves to the spiritual nature. Now
[56:14] our natural nature will work against the
[56:18] uh principles of God's word very often.
[56:22] There are some people and we're all made
[56:23] so very very different. There's some
[56:26] people that seem more adapted to
[56:29] spiritual things and others are you know
[56:31] almost like renegades or whatever more
[56:34] and have a harsh nature whatever more.
[56:36] But but you take the Apostle Paul and
[56:39] brother Brandham talks about James and
[56:41] such a prayer warrior and and Peter, you
[56:44] know, he's a uh he he just impetuous
[56:47] type of person and and Apostle Paul, he
[56:50] was scholarly, but he was almost you can
[56:52] see almost harsh in that sense. BUT GOD
[56:55] HE GOD didn't eradicate them. He didn't
[56:58] eradicate those things out of them. He
[57:00] took control of those things and used
[57:02] them to his glory. He brought that
[57:04] nature subject to the divine nature. Can
[57:07] you say amen?
[57:11] [clears throat]
[57:12] &gt;&gt; And so this nature that this word that
[57:16] is used is not only the nature of things
[57:18] but it is the force.
[57:21] It is law. It is a law. The nature is a
[57:24] law. the order of nature
[57:27] and uh it has to do with the very life
[57:32] that comes from God by the Holy Spirit.
[57:35] Now,
[57:37] now our nature by our natural birth, it
[57:42] did not come
[57:44] to
[57:46] it didn't manifest immediately.
[57:50] Little by little, the infant that's
[57:52] born, you don't see much of a nature
[57:55] there. But as time goes on, it begins to
[57:58] express itself. It may be real quiet and
[58:01] passive. And there can be there can be
[58:03] more than one child. It's be perhaps
[58:05] born in a family. And you'll just wonder
[58:08] how in the world these children with
[58:10] such a vastly different nature. How do
[58:11] they come from the same parents? You
[58:13] know, one is just so passive and quiet
[58:16] and the next one is so active you can't
[58:18] hardly get your hands on them. And
[58:20] that's the way they are. We are that
[58:22] way. Then that nature needs to be needs
[58:24] to be developed. But it doesn't manifest
[58:26] right away. Now when a child is a
[58:29] stillborn child, say just still born and
[58:33] doesn't come and that breath of life
[58:35] doesn't come into it. It's the
[58:37] conception may be perfect. The birth may
[58:40] be flawless. Everything happens just
[58:43] great. But it doesn't take that breath
[58:45] of life into it. You never know. No one
[58:48] will ever know what kind of a child that
[58:50] was going to be. Might have been a
[58:52] gifted child, might have been a talented
[58:54] child, might have been who knows what.
[58:56] But the life that was in it, there was
[58:58] nothing to animate that nature that it
[59:01] may have had. And so we don't know what
[59:03] kind of a child it was going to be in a
[59:05] stillborn. And we have all kinds of
[59:07] people today in the religious world that
[59:10] they have the seed of God and they can
[59:14] have all kinds of things in order. But
[59:15] if the Holy Spirit doesn't come and
[59:19] acknowledge that that is indeed his
[59:22] word, his truth, his message for the
[59:24] hour, that church or whoever they are
[59:27] will never manifest.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; It's nothing more than a a religious
[59:32] stillborn.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Might sound harsh, but that's what I
[59:35] believe it is.
[59:38] Now, [clears throat]
[59:39] uh Solomon said in Proverbs, "Train up a
[59:42] child in the way he should go, and when
[59:45] he's old, he will not depart from it."
[59:49] And to train up does not speak of a
[59:51] profession, but rather of moral
[59:53] character. Train up a child in his in
[59:57] his moral character, and he'll when he's
[1:00:00] old, he will not depart from it. Now,
[1:00:03] the very nature and character of Jesus
[1:00:06] Christ is available to us all by the
[1:00:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost. We do need
[1:00:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And for
[1:00:15] those of you that have been baptized in
[1:00:17] water, I want you to know that the Holy
[1:00:20] Spirit is waiting and perhaps has
[1:00:23] already taken up his residency, but he
[1:00:26] is waiting for full residency to abide
[1:00:29] in you because he's going to bring the
[1:00:31] life of Jesus Christ into you. And that
[1:00:34] divine nature is going to control
[1:00:38] your natural nature. The desires that
[1:00:41] you have had, they're going to become
[1:00:43] subjected to the very life of Jesus
[1:00:46] Christ. And the things that you once
[1:00:48] loved, you'll find them e away. And as
[1:00:50] apostle Paul said, the things I once
[1:00:52] loved, I now hate. And the things I once
[1:00:54] hated, I now love. What brought that
[1:00:57] reversal
[1:00:58] because initially he was going by his
[1:01:00] own nature and he had his character and
[1:01:03] he had developed it and all right and
[1:01:05] his perhaps his mother and father maybe
[1:01:07] sent him. I don't know who got him to
[1:01:09] the feet of Galo, but he was a great
[1:01:12] student and he had a he he he was
[1:01:14] talented and gifted. You can see that in
[1:01:17] all of his letters. But now what
[1:01:19] happened when the things and he said
[1:01:21] those things I learned I counted as dung
[1:01:24] that I might win Christ.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; What is it? Another life came into him.
[1:01:29] Another nature came into him that that
[1:01:32] brought the nature the human person
[1:01:35] BROUGHT IT INTO SUBJECTION. AMEN.
[1:01:37] HALLELUJAH. He still had all his mental
[1:01:39] capacity, still had all of his
[1:01:41] retention, still had all of those
[1:01:43] things, but now it was brought subject
[1:01:45] to the spirit and word of God.
[1:01:48] Hallelujah.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; So the nature
[1:01:54] is the nature, the divine nature.
[1:01:58] Now, in the token, we're going to be
[1:02:01] having the Lord's table tonight,
[1:02:03] communion, and foot washing. Brother
[1:02:05] Lance will be speaking this evening and
[1:02:08] we're going to have a great time. Now, a
[1:02:11] lot of a lot of you young people, I want
[1:02:14] to announce to you that you may have
[1:02:17] participated, some may not have
[1:02:19] participated in communion, footwashing,
[1:02:21] never never feeling that they were ready
[1:02:24] for it. Others perhaps have taken it,
[1:02:28] but I'd like to say that I believe
[1:02:30] there's a good number of you that have
[1:02:31] never participated in communion and
[1:02:34] footwashing at the level that you will
[1:02:37] tonight.
[1:02:38] I want you to come with expectation
[1:02:41] because you'll say, "I took some major
[1:02:43] steps. I made some decisions. God
[1:02:46] honored those decisions. The Holy Spirit
[1:02:48] moved on me. And if he moved on me, uh,
[1:02:51] he didn't move on me just for some idle
[1:02:54] purpose. He moved on me with a divine
[1:02:56] plan in his mind. And I'm here tonight
[1:03:00] to move on and to take another step and
[1:03:03] to take this blessed communion and
[1:03:05] remember the Lord's death and his
[1:03:07] resurrection and to do the foot washing
[1:03:09] with my brother and my sister and at a
[1:03:12] different level. I've never done this
[1:03:14] before at this level. Amen.
[1:03:19] Now he said the animal life, see the
[1:03:22] animal life could not come back upon the
[1:03:25] human being because it was an animal. It
[1:03:28] couldn't come back upon the human being.
[1:03:30] When the blood was shed, the life went
[1:03:33] out.
[1:03:34] He said because it was a unit. But when
[1:03:38] the life's blood was gone from it, the
[1:03:41] life being different from the blood
[1:03:44] because he says there is a blood.
[1:03:46] There's the life in the blood and
[1:03:49] there's a soul in the life or the soul
[1:03:52] is the nature of the life. So there's
[1:03:54] the blood which is just a chemistry and
[1:03:58] there's a life in the blood for he said
[1:04:00] the life is in the blood but within that
[1:04:03] life
[1:04:06] is the soul and the soul is the nature
[1:04:10] of the life.
[1:04:13] Now the animal didn't have a soul.
[1:04:17] So when it died and as a sacrifice as a
[1:04:21] substitute all there was was the
[1:04:23] chemistry of the blood and the life
[1:04:27] which departed the body of the animal
[1:04:30] but that life could not come back onto
[1:04:33] the believer. So the man or the man for
[1:04:37] his household take the Passover lamb or
[1:04:39] as a sin sacrifice. He would take the
[1:04:42] animal, take it to the priest, lay his
[1:04:44] hand upon the head, thus identifying
[1:04:47] himself. This innocent animal is dying
[1:04:50] for my transgression and I am
[1:04:52] identifying myself with it. So I put my
[1:04:55] hand upon it and the priest begins to
[1:04:58] slay this animal. Of course, it doesn't
[1:05:00] want to die. It flails around and blood
[1:05:03] sprinkles over the transgressor and and
[1:05:05] and the life departs the animal and the
[1:05:08] blood goes to the to to the earth. The
[1:05:11] blood goes one direction, the life goes
[1:05:13] another direction, but the life can't
[1:05:16] come back on the on the transgressor and
[1:05:18] he goes out with the same nature.
[1:05:21] He's sorry when he comes in. He's gone
[1:05:23] to his flock. He's brought the he's
[1:05:26] brought the animal according to the word
[1:05:28] of God. He wants to be forgiven. He
[1:05:31] wants to find mercy. AND THAT HE does in
[1:05:34] that his sins are covered but not gone.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; His nature remains the same. So he goes
[1:05:41] there and the animal dies, the life
[1:05:44] goes, the blood goes, and they're
[1:05:46] separated and uh and the man walks out
[1:05:49] with the same nature
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; that he had when he walked in. Right.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; But now we have the lamb of God.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says in Isaiah 53, if
[1:06:01] you care to read it, I may come to a
[1:06:02] little later, says he poured out his
[1:06:06] soul onto death. He he actually
[1:06:10] dispensed with the very divine nature of
[1:06:14] God. And the one who could carry that
[1:06:17] would be the Holy Spirit of God. So the
[1:06:20] spirit of God has to take that nature
[1:06:23] that was released by God at Calvary WHEN
[1:06:27] THAT SACRIFICE DIED AND THAT nature
[1:06:30] literally literally comes. It's not in
[1:06:32] the mind. THIS IS THIS IS AN ACTUAL
[1:06:35] EVENT. IT ACTUALLY COMES INTO THE
[1:06:38] INDIVIDUAL.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; How did your spirit come into you? You
[1:06:41] don't know. You have a human spirit. You
[1:06:44] don't know how it came into you. You
[1:06:46] took a BREATH AT YOUR BIRTH. YOU WEREN'T
[1:06:48] even aware of it. The doctor perhaps
[1:06:49] gave you a spank or whatever more and
[1:06:51] you began to cry and out and the spirit
[1:06:54] entered your body. And when you take
[1:06:56] your last breath, when you take your
[1:06:58] last breath exhale, that spirit will
[1:07:00] actually leave you and you'll be nothing
[1:07:03] more than clay.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; That's all you are. And the dust will go
[1:07:07] back to dust and ashes. And the spirit
[1:07:10] will depart your body. You don't know
[1:07:13] how that spirit came into you, but it
[1:07:15] was a real event
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; and you made some noise when it
[1:07:19] happened.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Spirit comes into you,
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; you want you young people and all
[1:07:26] others, if you have not received it, you
[1:07:29] want to know that this is a promise of
[1:07:31] God THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD HAS SENT
[1:07:34] WITH A COMPLETE with a mission. He's
[1:07:36] sent with a mission TO BRING THE DIVINE
[1:07:39] NATURE INTO THIS BRANCH SO THAT THIS
[1:07:42] BRANCH can bring forth fruit of the same
[1:07:44] kind.
[1:07:46] That's the plan of God. And that's how
[1:07:48] it happens. And I say, "Oh God, LET THAT
[1:07:51] SPIRIT OF GOD FLOW like a fountain, like
[1:07:56] a river, like a LIKE A RAIN UPON the
[1:07:59] people of God." Maybe even during this
[1:08:02] service, throughout this day, tonight,
[1:08:04] say, "Oh God, fill me. Fill me with the
[1:08:06] Holy Ghost. Seal me with your divine
[1:08:09] spirit and let the very divine nature of
[1:08:12] God. That spirit can only believe and
[1:08:15] agree with this word.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; And it's by believing it that the divine
[1:08:20] nature begins to function and operate in
[1:08:22] an individual believing every word of
[1:08:25] God.
[1:08:27] Satan is such a subtle
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; creature and how he will get a a a
[1:08:32] family or a couple or an individual and
[1:08:36] and you know in your own heart there
[1:08:39] gets a twinge down there just a slight
[1:08:41] little twinge. This isn't exactly the
[1:08:45] way the word of God calls for it to be.
[1:08:47] And I I don't really feel good about it
[1:08:49] but I'm SO PRESSED. AND SATAN USES ALL
[1:08:52] KINDS of things. HE'LL USE A educational
[1:08:55] program. Oh, he'll use the jobs that we
[1:08:58] have. He'll use every kind. He'll use
[1:09:01] friends. He'll use all kinds of things.
[1:09:03] He'll use family obligations. He'll use
[1:09:06] all kinds of things to get a person to
[1:09:09] start moving outside of the sphere of
[1:09:12] the promise of God. And once he gets a
[1:09:15] person out there, then the Holy Spirit
[1:09:18] cannot function and operate the way that
[1:09:20] the way that God desires it to be. And
[1:09:23] that person will find themselves
[1:09:26] reverting to their own nature.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; You follow that?
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; They'll find themselves reverting to
[1:09:35] their own nature.
[1:09:38] But when you're when you're under
[1:09:41] under the influence of the Holy Spirit,
[1:09:44] when you're in the company of believers,
[1:09:46] you are affected. You are affected. When
[1:09:49] you're under the sound of the gospel,
[1:09:51] when you're under the constant uh sound
[1:09:54] of the message of the hour, when you're
[1:09:56] absorbing it and taking it in, I can
[1:09:58] tell you even when you may not realize
[1:10:00] it, there's that move, that twinge, that
[1:10:03] that voice that's speaking, it's
[1:10:05] guiding, it's influencing you, it's
[1:10:07] affecting you, it's it's bringing a
[1:10:08] godly conscience to you.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:15] the animal life.
[1:10:17] It's been some years and I just went
[1:10:20] through and kind of detailed how when
[1:10:24] the lamb came and the body
[1:10:28] in the Passover lamb, the body was taken
[1:10:31] and eaten and the blood went to the
[1:10:34] doorpost and the lentil of the door and
[1:10:37] the life went back to the creator who
[1:10:40] gave it.
[1:10:43] and it could never come back together
[1:10:45] again. But when Jesus died, the body
[1:10:48] went to the tomb. The spirit ascended
[1:10:53] and then came back into the believer.
[1:10:56] The blood, the chemistry actually went
[1:10:58] and stained the earth to claim it in
[1:11:01] redemption.
[1:11:03] But now,
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; it all began to come back.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; This land began to come together again.
[1:11:11] Hallelujah. was the only one that could
[1:11:12] come together again.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. All a unit came back together and
[1:11:17] we're part of that unit.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The spirit came back down
[1:11:22] into us. And the prophet says the word
[1:11:25] the bleeding word. Hallelujah.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; The content of of the the blood, the
[1:11:31] efficacy of it.
[1:11:34] And then brother Brandon goes on in the
[1:11:36] token. And he says, "Because it could
[1:11:38] not come upon a human being, because the
[1:11:40] animal life doesn't have a soul." And
[1:11:43] the animal, notice what his next
[1:11:44] sentence is. It's it's rather strange,
[1:11:47] but it's in certainly in the correct
[1:11:49] place. The animal doesn't know that he's
[1:11:53] naked
[1:11:55] and he doesn't realize sin. The animal
[1:11:58] doesn't have a soul
[1:12:00] and because he doesn't have a soul, he
[1:12:02] doesn't realize he's naked.
[1:12:04] Makes me wonder how far people have gone
[1:12:07] from their soul
[1:12:10] today when we see what's around us in
[1:12:13] the cities and the streets and so on.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Naked and don't know it.
[1:12:22] From the from the nature of the life in
[1:12:24] the soul comes the knowledge of
[1:12:27] nakedness.
[1:12:29] So I I'm just making that statement
[1:12:30] because I'm going to be coming back to
[1:12:32] it.
[1:12:34] From the nature of the life in the soul
[1:12:37] comes a knowledge of nakedness. And so
[1:12:41] now if there is no God
[1:12:44] conscience within a individual
[1:12:48] they can stoop to nakedness and not know
[1:12:51] it. And what is that? It's an animal
[1:12:54] nature.
[1:12:55] That's not the God nature. It's just the
[1:12:57] animal nature.
[1:13:01] He said, "Now there's a life, a blood,
[1:13:05] and a soul in the life." Which I said,
[1:13:07] and he said, "The soul is the nature of
[1:13:09] the life." He said, "Now therefore, the
[1:13:12] blood, the just the blood, the chemistry
[1:13:15] stood, it stood for a token. A token, a
[1:13:19] token is just a sign." So you have the
[1:13:22] sign
[1:13:24] that a life was given.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; But there's a difference between the
[1:13:28] blood and the life. Amen.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; I just want to make these statements
[1:13:31] now. The token for the believer today is
[1:13:35] the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; So now the token is a sign the Holy
[1:13:40] Ghost in an individual is a sign that a
[1:13:44] life was given for you.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And now the Holy Ghost by the Holy Ghost
[1:13:48] that life comes into the individual. And
[1:13:51] he goes on to say in the same now we are
[1:13:54] living in the shadows. I have a specific
[1:13:56] reason for saying these things. Now we
[1:13:59] are living in the shadows and the wrath
[1:14:01] is ready to strike. And God's requiring
[1:14:04] a token that you yourself have received
[1:14:07] his token, the Holy Ghost. It's the only
[1:14:10] way and the only sign that God will ever
[1:14:13] pass. Said, "I'll pass over you." But he
[1:14:16] said that's the only sign he'll ever
[1:14:18] pass over because it is the literal
[1:14:21] notice not the imagination but the
[1:14:24] literal life of Jesus Christ returned
[1:14:28] back into the believer. Oh we feel so
[1:14:31] unworthy.
[1:14:33] We feel so what shall I say so much
[1:14:37] shortcoming of the life of Christ. But
[1:14:41] yet it's essential, absolutely essential
[1:14:45] that every believer confesses what the
[1:14:47] word of God has said. And you need to
[1:14:50] say, "I have received and I am the
[1:14:53] recipient of the life of Jesus Christ,
[1:14:57] not in my mind, but the very literal
[1:14:59] life of Jesus Christ by the Holy
[1:15:02] Spirit." Because thus saith the word of
[1:15:05] God, not thus sayeth how I feel this
[1:15:07] morning, thus saith the word of God.
[1:15:10] Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you feel the very weakest
[1:15:13] when you're in a time of need, but
[1:15:15] that's the time you need to trust what
[1:15:17] the word of God has said about it. He
[1:15:21] poured out his soul unto death. If you
[1:15:23] want the verse, it's Isaiah 53:12.
[1:15:26] Therefore, I will divide him a portion
[1:15:30] with the great, speaking of Jesus.
[1:15:34] and he shall divide the spoil with the
[1:15:36] strong because he hath poured out his
[1:15:39] soul unto death. And he was numbered
[1:15:43] with the transgressors and he bare the
[1:15:46] sin of ma of many and made intercession
[1:15:49] for the transgressors. Now you see when
[1:15:52] Adam sinned Adam and Eve and God said in
[1:15:57] the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt
[1:15:59] surely die. Now he didn't die
[1:16:03] immediately but what he did was he lost
[1:16:06] his god nature.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; He lost his way. And the scripture says
[1:16:13] that the cherubams protected the way of
[1:16:17] the tree of life. It isn't they
[1:16:19] protected the way of life which was the
[1:16:21] tree of life. They didn't have to
[1:16:23] protect the tree of life. They protected
[1:16:26] the way of the tree of life. and the way
[1:16:29] he lost he lost his his god uh uh wisdom
[1:16:35] he lost his god knowledge he lost his
[1:16:37] god consciousness and it finally ebbed
[1:16:40] away and that is why it wasn't very long
[1:16:42] before people were very very deep into
[1:16:46] their transgression
[1:16:48] now it is Peter that has said and I'd
[1:16:50] like now to refer to the nature of the
[1:16:53] life of Christ
[1:16:55] also also needs to be nurtured Ed, we
[1:16:59] can't just, you know, come to church and
[1:17:02] say, "Well, here I am. Now I'm here to
[1:17:04] hear a few things." And go out and
[1:17:06] forget, not only forget perhaps the
[1:17:08] things that we've heard, but uh we're
[1:17:11] just completely occupied with all kinds
[1:17:12] of other things. Brother John Andy spoke
[1:17:15] to the uh all the young people. We had a
[1:17:18] marvelous crowd. Had a just an
[1:17:19] incredible time together on Friday
[1:17:22] night. and he spoke to them and had a
[1:17:25] PowerPoint uh presentation on uh prayer,
[1:17:30] on study, on reading, on witnessing and
[1:17:34] the various aspects of the practical
[1:17:37] side of living a life for Christ. And we
[1:17:42] need those things instilled within us.
[1:17:44] And you might say, now why are we doing
[1:17:46] that? That sounds almost like a uh like
[1:17:49] a school lesson. Well, that is how we
[1:17:52] have our natural nature developed our by
[1:17:56] our natural birth. And the spiritual
[1:17:59] birth certainly requires the same
[1:18:01] things. We need to have a diligent time
[1:18:05] when we take time to pray, when we take
[1:18:09] time to study, when we take time to
[1:18:11] witness, when we take time to live it.
[1:18:14] Because what we're doing is we're
[1:18:15] developing that nature. We we we can't
[1:18:18] earn that nature. We can't buy that
[1:18:20] nature. We receive that nature, but it
[1:18:22] needs to be developed.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Whereby are given unto us exceeding and
[1:18:29] great and precious promises that by
[1:18:31] these you might be partakers of the
[1:18:34] divine nature, having escaped the
[1:18:36] corruption that is in the world through
[1:18:38] lust. So faith believing the promises
[1:18:42] will produce the divine nature. And
[1:18:45] faith believing the promises will cause
[1:18:47] you and I to live differently,
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; to respond differently.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; We will react differently.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; We will be the a different kind of a
[1:19:00] brother or sister. Our relationships
[1:19:02] will be different. Our appetites will be
[1:19:05] different. Our words coming out of our
[1:19:07] mouth will be different because they'll
[1:19:10] be guided by the scripture. And when we
[1:19:13] when we bring ourselves into subjection
[1:19:16] by the Holy Spirit to the word of God,
[1:19:19] believing the word of God, then God acts
[1:19:22] upon that. The Holy Spirit, even the the
[1:19:26] high priest acts upon that. And it may
[1:19:29] be a time of sickness or whatever more.
[1:19:31] The high priest acts upon that. But then
[1:19:33] when it comes to a time and we all en
[1:19:36] encounter these times we say oh you know
[1:19:40] uh my natural my natural life would
[1:19:44] respond in a certain way I I I I feel
[1:19:47] like just giving him a piece of my mind
[1:19:50] but there's another nature
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; that is within you and it's overriding
[1:19:56] that nature and uh you know it's not
[1:20:00] just your self self-control it's not
[1:20:02] self-control. I call it God control. And
[1:20:06] in a congregation of people in our
[1:20:09] homes, in our jobs, we need that kind of
[1:20:13] practical living. And it comes by the
[1:20:15] Holy Spirit. And so I want all the young
[1:20:18] people especially who have received a
[1:20:21] special touch from God say, "God, I know
[1:20:24] that that's not the end of it. This is
[1:20:26] just the very beginning." And some
[1:20:28] people they may even go for some years
[1:20:30] and never really receive that infusion
[1:20:33] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Colossians, Paul goes on in Colossians
[1:20:41] and he says, "Rooted and built up in
[1:20:44] him." Rooted. We haven't only come into
[1:20:46] Christ, but we're rooted and built up in
[1:20:50] him and established in the faith. In in
[1:20:54] first Peter, Peter goes on to say, "And
[1:20:56] you also as lively stones are built up."
[1:21:01] A spiritual house. It's not enough just
[1:21:03] to be a lively stone, but a lively stone
[1:21:05] that needs to be built up. The ministry
[1:21:08] is involved in this. And you are
[1:21:10] involved in this. You make yourself
[1:21:13] available. You you create an atmosphere.
[1:21:16] You come into the house of God. You
[1:21:19] don't just come in to, you know, to put
[1:21:21] in a couple of hours of a Sunday morning
[1:21:23] or a Sunday night. That's not the
[1:21:25] purpose. You come in, you're in
[1:21:26] anticipation. You're in expectation.
[1:21:30] This is my family. God is my father. His
[1:21:33] spirit is present. His word is present.
[1:21:36] And I am present. And I'm believing his
[1:21:39] word. I know that THAT COMBINATION IS A
[1:21:41] POWERFUL COMBINATION. AND I WILL RECEIVE
[1:21:44] SOMETHING FROM GOD. AND THEN WHEN I
[1:21:46] RECEIVE IT, I WILL BE A BENEFIT TO
[1:21:48] SOMEONE WHO'S BESIDE ME OR SOMEONE IN MY
[1:21:51] FAMILY. I WON'T BE A DETRIMENT. I WILL
[1:21:53] BE A BLESSING TO THEM. HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; That's God's program
[1:22:01] built up, developed
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; in the divine nature.
[1:22:06] And so the preaching of Apostle Paul was
[1:22:08] often taken
[1:22:11] in a negative way. He even said, "Have I
[1:22:14] become your enemy because I told you the
[1:22:15] truth."
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; So the preaching of the apostle Paul was
[1:22:19] for edification, for building up, and
[1:22:21] not for destruction.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; He said in 2 Corinthians 10:8, "For
[1:22:27] though I should boast somewhat more than
[1:22:29] more of our authority, which the Lord
[1:22:32] hath given us for edification, not for
[1:22:36] your destruction." He said, "I should
[1:22:38] not be ashamed." So he said, "Though I
[1:22:40] boast, though I should boast," he didn't
[1:22:42] say that he did boast, but he said,
[1:22:44] "Though I should boast, uh, somewhat
[1:22:47] more of our authority which the Lord
[1:22:49] hath given us for edification." It's for
[1:22:53] building up the instruction or the
[1:22:55] counsel that we receive from God.
[1:22:58] Sometimes it's not really what we want
[1:22:59] to hear, but that kind of edi
[1:23:02] edification and counsel is to build you
[1:23:04] up. That's right.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; It's to develop that nature that God has
[1:23:08] made available to you. And the Holy
[1:23:11] Spirit is in you and he wants to he
[1:23:14] wants to express that nature. Oh beloved
[1:23:17] nature of Jesus Christ. The one who God
[1:23:21] looked upon and said, "I'm pleased with
[1:23:23] that life." That's the life I I'm sure I
[1:23:26] can speak on your behalf. That's the
[1:23:28] life we want to express.
[1:23:32] Now [clears throat] I'm going to go off
[1:23:36] on a different angle
[1:23:40] just so you can put it together. Now I
[1:23:42] want to go on a national level and I
[1:23:46] want to speak about the nation of Israel
[1:23:48] because Apostle Paul and this probably
[1:23:50] will be maybe a little bit of a surprise
[1:23:52] to you but
[1:23:55] and I just hope that you can I wrestled
[1:23:57] with it a bit while I was studying and
[1:24:00] waiting on God for this service
[1:24:03] and I've been on this for some time. A
[1:24:06] lot of a lot of you people like to erase
[1:24:08] something that I think is they think,
[1:24:10] well, I I study on Saturday.
[1:24:13] That's a day I try to take a little time
[1:24:15] off, but I haven't been successful yet.
[1:24:17] But any minister, he doesn't study on
[1:24:19] Saturday. He's studying for maybe a week
[1:24:21] or two weeks on a subject, and I have
[1:24:24] been on this subject probably for two
[1:24:26] weeks and a good part of this week on
[1:24:28] it.
[1:24:31] Israel
[1:24:32] as a nation
[1:24:35] was planted. God said as a noble vine.
[1:24:40] He said, "And I will dwell,"
[1:24:43] he said to Moses, "I will dwell among
[1:24:45] the people,
[1:24:47] the children of Israel, and will be
[1:24:50] their God." Isn't that marvelous? I will
[1:24:54] dwell among them through the first
[1:24:56] prophet that was on the earth, Moses. I
[1:24:58] will dwell among them and I will be
[1:25:02] their God. I God will dwell among them.
[1:25:04] The supernatural God. I'm going to dwell
[1:25:07] among you. Wouldn't it be marvelous? You
[1:25:09] just hear that this morning from an
[1:25:11] authorative voice. I'm going to dwell
[1:25:13] among you. You're not asking you. You
[1:25:15] are you inviting me. Said I'm going to
[1:25:17] dwell among you and I'm going to be your
[1:25:19] God.
[1:25:21] I'd say even so, Lord. HALLELUJAH. EVEN
[1:25:24] SO. I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING better this
[1:25:26] morning. And even though that was God's
[1:25:28] intent and that's what he was referring
[1:25:31] to when he went back uh to Jeremiah and
[1:25:34] that is many many years later centuries
[1:25:38] later. So now initially God planted them
[1:25:41] as a noble vine and I will dwell among
[1:25:45] them
[1:25:47] and Israel was taught nurtured under the
[1:25:51] best that God could send them his holy
[1:25:55] prophets
[1:25:57] and godly kings. They had many wicked
[1:25:59] ones also. But they were nurtured and
[1:26:03] they were tutored by their prophets.
[1:26:06] They were blessed as they heard the word
[1:26:10] and they were cursed when they refused
[1:26:12] it.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And so God now cries through Jeremiah.
[1:26:17] Jeremiah is called the weeping prophet.
[1:26:20] He says, "Yet I planted thee a noble
[1:26:23] vine holy, wholy,"
[1:26:29] not hy, but completely holy. A right
[1:26:33] seed. I planted you a noble vine and
[1:26:38] completely a right seed. And he ASKED
[1:26:40] THE QUESTION, HOW THEN?
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; ART thou turned into a degenerate plant
[1:26:48] of a strange vine unto me? And the
[1:26:52] strange vine if you take those words and
[1:26:54] and I have taken them in detail. The
[1:26:56] strange vine like he SAYS HOW DID YOU
[1:26:58] BECOME A STRANGE WOMAN TO ME? AND THE
[1:27:00] PROPHET said Israel was Jehovah's wife.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; He says how you become a strange WOMAN
[1:27:07] TO ME. IN FACT IS IT COMES BACK FURTHER
[1:27:09] down and it says how you become a harlot
[1:27:12] to me.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; How you become a strange how you become
[1:27:14] a degenerate. I planted you as a holy
[1:27:17] vine, a noble vine. And then how did
[1:27:20] this happen?
[1:27:22] Although they had the glory as Paul said
[1:27:24] in Romans 9, who are Israelites? Paul,
[1:27:28] he was gripped with a compassion and
[1:27:32] burden for his people. He said, "Who are
[1:27:34] Israelites to whom pertainth the
[1:27:36] adoption and the glory and the covenants
[1:27:40] and the giving of the law and the
[1:27:42] service of God and the promises?" YOU'VE
[1:27:45] BEEN GIVEN ALL OF THIS. And who are
[1:27:48] whose are the fathers and of whom are as
[1:27:52] concerning the flesh Christ came who is
[1:27:55] overall God blessed forever.
[1:27:59] They're Israelites and all of these
[1:28:02] things pertain to them. The adoption and
[1:28:04] the glory and the covenants and the
[1:28:06] giving of the law and the service of God
[1:28:09] and the promises. And that's what that
[1:28:11] that's what God was saying. I've given
[1:28:14] you all these things and I planted you a
[1:28:17] noble vine. How did then you become a
[1:28:20] degenerate
[1:28:21] plant and a stranger to me?
[1:28:27] God spoke and I'm going to just give
[1:28:29] some detail now how it happened.
[1:28:34] God spoke to in Exodus.
[1:28:37] He says as instruction, "Thou shalt not
[1:28:40] dwell in thy land. They rather I'm sorry
[1:28:44] they and he was just speaking of some
[1:28:45] other nations. They shall not dwell in
[1:28:48] thy land, lest they make thee sin
[1:28:51] against me. For if thou serve their
[1:28:54] gods, it will surely be a snare
[1:28:58] unto thee.
[1:29:01] And Satan has not ceased. He's changed
[1:29:04] the scenery. Right?
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Maybe we don't have little gods, idol
[1:29:11] gods like so of gold and whatever more.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Do you know there's a there's a family
[1:29:17] and I think they're probably listening
[1:29:18] to me right now and they were given a a
[1:29:22] a gold object, solid pure gold object of
[1:29:27] a figure and it was just given them.
[1:29:30] They didn't pay a whole lot of attention
[1:29:31] to it.
[1:29:33] And uh then they begin to look into it.
[1:29:36] They I think whether someone told them
[1:29:39] or they discovered it was really a very
[1:29:41] valuable object
[1:29:44] and they found out it find found out
[1:29:46] later it was extremely valuable worth
[1:29:49] many many thousands of dollars.
[1:29:54] And then they discovered that it was a a
[1:29:57] god. It had been made a god. No doubt
[1:30:01] people worshiped it. And it came way
[1:30:04] down from Central America.
[1:30:07] And you know what they did? They took
[1:30:09] that and melted it down
[1:30:13] to nothing and took it out to their
[1:30:16] driveway out next to the highway and
[1:30:19] poured it in the ground.
[1:30:22] Let it go back.
[1:30:24] Now, none of you come and ask me which
[1:30:26] driveway that is.
[1:30:29] I'm not going to tell you. I know the
[1:30:31] driveway, too. But I never went there
[1:30:33] with my shovel. That thing's gone down
[1:30:35] there. They said, "If this is a god, it
[1:30:38] only deserves to go to the fire and goes
[1:30:41] to the fire and it'll just pour it out
[1:30:42] in the ground and forget we ever had the
[1:30:45] thing." I SAY, "GOD BLESS THEM."
[1:30:48] And they're probably listening right now
[1:30:50] and they know exactly what I'm talking
[1:30:52] about. So I say, "God bless them." But
[1:30:54] they God is saying to Moses, you know,
[1:30:57] there's all kinds of gods that became a
[1:30:59] God.
[1:31:01] We have gods and goddesses and
[1:31:03] everything else. As far as I'm concern
[1:31:06] concerned, all the stardom of Hollywood
[1:31:10] of sports
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; of singers and entertainers is nothing
[1:31:16] but idolatry
[1:31:19] in the highest sense of the word. It's
[1:31:21] idolatry. And people give themselves
[1:31:24] over, not merely listen to it, but they
[1:31:27] emulate them. Emulate them in their
[1:31:30] movements. Emulate them in their
[1:31:31] hairstyles. Emulate them in their dress.
[1:31:34] Whatever more I say it's idolatry.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Do you support that?
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; And don't give them any room in YOUR
[1:31:45] PLACE.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WILL BE A SNARE UNTO YOU.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; It's a snare. AND SATAN WILL TRY TO UH
[1:31:56] SQUEEZE OUT and to squaltch the work of
[1:31:59] the Holy Spirit IN YOUR LIFE BY THOSE
[1:32:01] THINGS, BUT THEY'RE SO INNOCENT. IT'S
[1:32:03] JUST SO INNOCENT. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
[1:32:06] WHAT KIND OF A spirit it packs.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just a magazine, is it?
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; It's just some true love story. True.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Probably the most false thing you'd have
[1:32:19] in your home. I trust you don't have it
[1:32:21] in your home. I'd rid myself of that
[1:32:23] stuff.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Those things that come from that that
[1:32:28] that kind of element and uh the whole
[1:32:31] world is given over to it.
[1:32:36] I personally think
[1:32:39] that the people will go mad into
[1:32:42] insanity when when California sanks.
[1:32:47] not over financial loss perhaps so much
[1:32:51] as over the loss of their idols
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; and I don't see them on television
[1:32:58] tomorrow I don't see them in the movie
[1:33:01] tomorrow or whatever more the loss of
[1:33:03] their gods and their goddesses and the
[1:33:06] prophet brother Brandham declared very
[1:33:08] very clearly that America had made woman
[1:33:12] their god goddess
[1:33:16] that's been said
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; and that's been declared.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; And so,
[1:33:22] and then God spoke through Jeremiah
[1:33:26] and he said that the people would say to
[1:33:30] a stalk or just to a piece of wood,
[1:33:33] "Thou art my father and to a stone, thou
[1:33:36] hast brought me forth. For they have
[1:33:39] turned their back unto me and not their
[1:33:42] face. But in the time of their trouble
[1:33:44] they will say arise and save us. So in
[1:33:47] the time THIS IS SO SUCH A WEAKNESS
[1:33:49] HUMAN weakness that they'll go in their
[1:33:51] own direction but then suddenly in A
[1:33:52] TIME OF TROUBLE OH SAVE US SAVE US. YOU
[1:33:54] NEVER HEAR them say oh devil come to me
[1:33:57] GOD. GOD SAVE US. WHERE ARE YOU GOD HELP
[1:34:00] ME NOW? WHY DON'T YOU SAY THAT? And why
[1:34:03] don't they say that when they're in good
[1:34:05] health and when they got a body to serve
[1:34:07] God? That's the time to give themselves
[1:34:10] to that. serve him with all of YOUR
[1:34:13] STRENGTH AND ALL OF YOUR MIND AND ALL OF
[1:34:15] your youth and all of the all of your
[1:34:18] energy. I believe that's what would be
[1:34:20] pleasing to him. And then he said also
[1:34:23] in Jeremiah 32:33, "And they have turned
[1:34:26] unto me that back and not the face,
[1:34:29] though I taught them, rising up early
[1:34:32] and teaching them." SO THEY HAD THE
[1:34:35] opportunity to be nurtured in the in the
[1:34:39] things of God, in the ways of God. But
[1:34:41] he said he taught them and he rising up
[1:34:43] early, teaching them, and yet they've
[1:34:45] not hearkened to receive instruction. So
[1:34:48] you see, uh, people, it comes down to
[1:34:52] very, very practical living.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; That's really what it boils down to.
[1:34:57] It's a very, VERY PRACTICAL LIFE. IT'S
[1:34:59] wonderful to come into the house of God
[1:35:01] and be all enthused. I want to see that.
[1:35:04] It's wonderful to, you know, clap our
[1:35:05] hands when the when the songs are being
[1:35:08] sung and worship God. That's just
[1:35:10] marvelous. I love that. I love to hear
[1:35:12] that. I'm glad we have that kind of that
[1:35:14] kind of freedom and and it's uh the
[1:35:18] exuberance of serving God. It's
[1:35:20] marvelous. But on the other hand, when
[1:35:22] the Monday morning comes, as we said,
[1:35:24] brother DJI spoke about when the Monday
[1:35:26] morning comes after the camp or after
[1:35:28] the meeting or tomorrow morning comes,
[1:35:30] we want to see that our course is still
[1:35:32] set and we are unmovable. This is the
[1:35:36] order of my life. This is the way I
[1:35:38] conduct it. This is the way my life is.
[1:35:40] This is the way our home is. This is the
[1:35:42] way we serve God. And we will NOT BE
[1:35:45] DETERRED from that.
[1:35:47] That's what God honors. That's what God
[1:35:50] honors. We're not one thing here and
[1:35:52] another thing tomorrow. We're the same
[1:35:54] thing. And I can tell you that the when
[1:35:57] God knows it, the devil also knows it.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And he knows he can't do anything with
[1:36:02] that kind of uh dedication and
[1:36:05] consecration.
[1:36:07] And that's what God honors.
[1:36:10] Now, Israel as a nation,
[1:36:13] they didn't only turn their back and,
[1:36:16] you know, they went into bondage and so
[1:36:17] on and so forth.
[1:36:19] They ultimately
[1:36:22] ultimately
[1:36:24] I would say committed the greatest of
[1:36:27] sin. They rejected the very word
[1:36:30] himself. As a nation they don't believe
[1:36:33] it yet.
[1:36:35] That's 2,000 over 2,000 years ago or
[1:36:38] thereabouts that they rejected the word
[1:36:41] of God their God. But they do not
[1:36:45] believe that to this day. They have not
[1:36:46] been convinced in 2,000 years. Even with
[1:36:49] everything that they've gone through,
[1:36:51] they are not convinced that they have
[1:36:53] rejected the word of God.
[1:36:57] But they rejected the very word himself.
[1:36:59] And they cried out, "Let his blood be on
[1:37:02] us and on our children." And I will say
[1:37:06] now the branches
[1:37:09] were broken off the vine
[1:37:13] and that life was no longer flowing
[1:37:17] there.
[1:37:18] And over many years and centuries I can
[1:37:21] say that the consequences of that
[1:37:24] decision that they took and crucified
[1:37:27] the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:37:30] the nation has paid a most horrific
[1:37:32] price.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we've moved along that far.
[1:37:38] Now I take a a quote
[1:37:43] and it's in Jezebel religion
[1:37:46] and the prophet said it is striking to
[1:37:48] see the parallel between Israel of the
[1:37:52] Old Testament and America now.
[1:37:57] Both of them were great nations.
[1:38:00] Both of them had been founded and
[1:38:03] [clears throat] their people had come
[1:38:05] there because excuse me of religious
[1:38:09] persecutions.
[1:38:11] Said it's striking the parallel.
[1:38:16] Now we've just come
[1:38:19] 2 3,000 years
[1:38:23] and we've come right forward. See things
[1:38:25] really haven't changed a whole lot. The
[1:38:27] scenery has changed, but as far as man
[1:38:30] and woman is concerned, as far as
[1:38:32] nations, as far as government, as far as
[1:38:34] all those things, that really hasn't
[1:38:36] changed a whole lot. Right. Right.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Israel had been persecuted by
[1:38:42] Pharaoh
[1:38:43] and had been in bondage for hundreds of
[1:38:46] years where they were deprived of
[1:38:49] worshiping the true and living God and
[1:38:52] had been deprived of their privilege and
[1:38:54] they become slaves.
[1:38:57] But God had made them a promise in his
[1:38:59] Bible or in his word and by his prophets
[1:39:03] that he'd give them a land and they'd
[1:39:05] come into this land and drove back the
[1:39:08] occupants of that land and he possessed
[1:39:11] their inheritance and had to possess
[1:39:14] their inheritance inheritance. For God
[1:39:16] had a purpose in doing that.
[1:39:20] He had a purpose in doing that. So they
[1:39:22] came into their land, drove back their
[1:39:25] the occupants. He said that's exactly
[1:39:28] America was established on exactly the
[1:39:30] same principles came came here for the
[1:39:34] purpose of freedom of worship and they
[1:39:37] wanted to escape the persecution of the
[1:39:40] hierarchy of the church that they had
[1:39:43] been so subjected to and persecuted
[1:39:46] severely. Christians have been s
[1:39:49] persecuted enormously by the Roman
[1:39:51] Empire
[1:39:53] and that power in the message hear ye
[1:39:56] him said the Holy Spirit when you
[1:39:58] receive it in the person of the Lord
[1:40:02] Jesus Christ dwelling in you and Jesus
[1:40:04] said by their fruit you shall know them.
[1:40:06] The fruit that the branch bears tells
[1:40:10] what the vine is. And so now the vine
[1:40:14] Israel moved out wanted freedom to
[1:40:18] worship their God.
[1:40:21] America was founded on those same exact
[1:40:25] principles.
[1:40:27] [clears throat]
[1:40:29] I will say the vine
[1:40:32] that God planted in a land that would be
[1:40:35] called America.
[1:40:39] And I I do not put any difference
[1:40:42] between United States and Canada for the
[1:40:46] balance of this message. None
[1:40:47] whatsoever. In fact, as brother Brandham
[1:40:50] said, we'd we'd be exactly the same. And
[1:40:53] we are
[1:40:55] in tested. Now, just stay with me a few
[1:40:57] moments here. In tested faith produces
[1:41:00] goods. Uh uh don't know exactly. It's
[1:41:03] all abbreviated. He said, "New England,
[1:41:07] excuse me, here's where our forefathers
[1:41:10] landed for this freedom of religion on
[1:41:14] Plymouth Rock. It's from these sacred
[1:41:17] soils here that praying men and women
[1:41:23] went forth to establish this great
[1:41:26] spiritual economy." Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; I WONDER HOW comfortable
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; those brethren who landed at Plymouth
[1:41:36] Rock WOULD BE TODAY.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; HOW COMFORTABLE would they be to walk
[1:41:40] the streets of any one of our cities.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; I believe that they would BE SHOCKED.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE SHAMED. I
[1:41:50] BELIEVE that they would wonder what it
[1:41:51] was they actually participated in in in
[1:41:55] founding.
[1:41:57] I believe they would WONDER AND SAY,
[1:41:59] "HOW DID THIS TURN INTO SUCH A
[1:42:01] DEGENERATE PLANT?
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; HOW DID THIS BECOME SO DEGENERATED?"
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; And they may wonder what some of us
[1:42:11] wonder from time to time. Is there
[1:42:13] anything to save?
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:42:23] He said,
[1:42:25] "No American could be ashamed of their
[1:42:28] forefathers who landed in this country
[1:42:32] and went to church packing their guns,
[1:42:34] who came here for freedom of religion
[1:42:36] and went on horseback and covered in old
[1:42:39] WAGONS AND FOUGHT AND SO FORTH. fought
[1:42:43] the Indians and so forth to get to go to
[1:42:45] church and their blood bathed the soil.
[1:42:50] NOW THIS IS EVERY BIT AS MUCH OF THE
[1:42:51] MESSAGE AS the seals is.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; This is the message.
[1:42:59] He said in the South Africa testimony, I
[1:43:01] think of Plymouth Rock and how our
[1:43:04] forefathers fought for this freedom of
[1:43:06] religion. And today I see what would
[1:43:10] they do? these old ministers back in
[1:43:13] those days to see the way things are
[1:43:15] going that we need a real good
[1:43:18] old-fashioned nationwide Holy Ghost sent
[1:43:22] revival to shake this nation. He said,
[1:43:24] "We really do. And without that, I'm
[1:43:26] afraid we're going to perish." Friends,
[1:43:31] talked about godly leaders, the
[1:43:33] parallel, the striking parallel between
[1:43:36] Israel and America.
[1:43:40] and America upon the bases of our
[1:43:42] forefathers who came here for religious
[1:43:45] freedoms. He said we had godly men in
[1:43:48] them days as leaders. George Washington,
[1:43:51] Abraham Lincoln, men of renowned
[1:43:54] character, men of God. America was
[1:43:57] America in those days. George Washington
[1:44:00] here at Valley Forge before he crossed
[1:44:03] the Delaware praying all night until he
[1:44:05] was wet plum to his waist, kneeling in
[1:44:08] snow. And the next morning when the
[1:44:10] Americans started across, there's only
[1:44:13] about 20% of them that had shoes to
[1:44:15] wear, the American army, and they had a
[1:44:18] principle. They had something that they
[1:44:20] had to fight for. They didn't care what
[1:44:23] came or went. The farmers came in and
[1:44:25] stomped his plow AND TOOK OUT HIS OX and
[1:44:28] got his rifle AND WENT TO FIGHT for what
[1:44:30] he knew was freedom. And that day he
[1:44:32] said, I believe it was four or five
[1:44:34] bullet holes, musket uh bullets went
[1:44:37] through his coat and never touched him.
[1:44:39] He goes on to to speak about how it was
[1:44:43] founded,
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; how the vine, what kind of vine was
[1:44:49] planted,
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; not 4,000 years ago, but even just A
[1:44:54] COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS AGO,
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; I will say all the world powers
[1:45:04] that involve themselves with Israel and
[1:45:08] the affairs of Israel.
[1:45:10] come under the direct effect of the hand
[1:45:13] of Almighty God.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; And all world POWERS HAVE FOUND it and
[1:45:20] made it their business to tamper with
[1:45:24] Israel. And when they did, they always
[1:45:28] conducted their affairs and their
[1:45:30] influence in a way that was CONTRARY TO
[1:45:33] THE PROMISE OF GOD AND THEN CAME under
[1:45:37] a negative or I to say
[1:45:41] uh came under the severity of God.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; All world powers, Egypt used them as
[1:45:49] slaves.
[1:45:52] Nebuchadnezzar had them exiled for 70
[1:45:55] years in Babylon. And where are they
[1:45:58] today? Where's the pharaohs? Where's
[1:46:01] Egypt? They're gone. Blown away. Where's
[1:46:04] Nebuchadnezzar? Where's a Where's a
[1:46:06] beautiful Babylon? It's gone.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Doesn't exist.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT REASON? NOT BECAUSE ANOTHER
[1:46:12] nation rose up that was more powerful
[1:46:14] than them. BECAUSE THEY TAMPERED WITH
[1:46:16] ISRAEL.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; That's the reason.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; The God of this word is the God of
[1:46:24] Israel.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; And I know that you believe that.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; And then David said, "By the rivers of
[1:46:32] Babylon, THERE WE SAT DOWN. YAY, we
[1:46:35] wept. We were we remembered Zion." They
[1:46:39] remembered Zion. And here they are in A
[1:46:41] FOREIGN COUNTRY. HOW CAN WE sing here in
[1:46:46] this kind of condition? And then they
[1:46:47] come under the cruel Roman rule
[1:46:52] which was there when Jesus was there.
[1:46:55] And God allowed these world powers of
[1:46:57] time to revel in their glory until their
[1:47:01] glory faded and their power diminished
[1:47:04] and they became morally corrupt from
[1:47:06] within.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; I don't know if any of you have had an
[1:47:09] opportunity such as I have. My wife and
[1:47:12] I, we were taken to Pompei. And the
[1:47:16] prophet says that when the sinking of
[1:47:19] Los Angeles happens, it'll be worse than
[1:47:21] the days of Pompei. But in Pompei, IT IS
[1:47:25] SO VILE AND SO PERVERTED. AND THE
[1:47:28] figures that are are are the the figures
[1:47:31] of the persons THAT WERE CAUGHT IN THE
[1:47:33] ashes from that great eruption that took
[1:47:36] place, IT TOOK THEM SO SUDDENLY. BUT
[1:47:39] POMPEI, IF YOU SEE IT, IT'S RAISED UP
[1:47:41] HIGH OVER THE over the ocean. You look
[1:47:44] down on the ocean AND OH, IT'S JUST
[1:47:47] SUNBATHED. It's such a beautiful place.
[1:47:50] And the climate is so uh marvelous. Just
[1:47:53] a wonderful climate. and and the people,
[1:47:57] the Roman officers, and we hear that
[1:47:59] hierarchy of the Roman government AFTER
[1:48:02] THEY CRUSHED ISRAEL AND burned Jerusalem
[1:48:06] were HAVING A BIG PARTY CELEBRATING
[1:48:09] THEIR VICTORY.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Comes that eruption
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; and the ash that came down on them. I
[1:48:21] see them. I see them right in the floor
[1:48:23] of their homes and they're and and and
[1:48:26] they're reaching out. Their hands are
[1:48:27] out. You see their fingers. You can see
[1:48:29] every part of the body. You can even see
[1:48:31] their teeth. AND IT CAUGHT them just
[1:48:32] like that and suffocated them. They're
[1:48:34] on their floor and the figures and they
[1:48:36] haven't moved them. Many of them are
[1:48:38] many of them are there. And you go into
[1:48:40] places and their houses of prostitution
[1:48:43] and brothel and the perversion and the
[1:48:45] homosexuality and all of these things.
[1:48:48] And they were and they WERE GLORIFYING
[1:48:50] THOSE THINGS. AND GOD DESTROYED THEM AND
[1:48:53] DESTROYED THE NATION AND DESTROYED THE
[1:48:56] EMPIRE BECAUSE THEY TAMPERED WITH HIS
[1:48:59] PEOPLE.
[1:49:14] The prophet says it's not the robin that
[1:49:16] pecks on the outside of the apple. It's
[1:49:18] the worm that's inside at the core.
[1:49:22] And he says
[1:49:24] it's the worm at the core that kills the
[1:49:26] apple. And he said, "And that's all of
[1:49:28] our own rottness among us. What it is,
[1:49:32] what's killing us is the moral decline
[1:49:35] that we have." Now the scripture which I
[1:49:39] read in the beginning
[1:49:43] uh but prior to that in Romans 1 says
[1:49:46] wherefore God also gave them up to
[1:49:49] uncleanness
[1:49:52] through the lust of their own hearts to
[1:49:55] dishonor their own bodies between
[1:49:57] themselves who changed the truth of God
[1:50:00] into a lie and worshiped and served the
[1:50:03] creature more than the creator who is
[1:50:06] blessed forever. ever. Amen. For this
[1:50:08] cause God gave them up unto vile
[1:50:11] affections. For even their women did
[1:50:14] change the natural use into that which
[1:50:17] is against nature. And likewise also men
[1:50:22] leaving the natural use of the woman,
[1:50:24] burned in their lust one toward another.
[1:50:28] men with men, working that which is
[1:50:30] unseemly, and receiving in themselves
[1:50:33] the recompense of their error, which was
[1:50:36] meat. And even as they did not like to
[1:50:39] retain God in their knowledge, God gave
[1:50:41] them over to a reprobate mind to do
[1:50:44] those things which are not convenient.
[1:50:47] They worshiped the creature more than
[1:50:50] the creator. And the in the mark of the
[1:50:53] beast, the prophet said, "What did they
[1:50:54] do?" Do you mind me reading?
[1:50:57] He said they refuse to drink from the
[1:50:59] fountain of living water. What makes all
[1:51:02] these things in the world today? He
[1:51:04] said, "What makes these ladies wear
[1:51:06] little shorts? What makes them wear
[1:51:08] those blouses that you can see uh their
[1:51:11] clothes through?" What is it? It's
[1:51:13] hungry children. That's right. Thirsty.
[1:51:16] Blessed are you when you thirst and
[1:51:17] hunger after righteousness.
[1:51:20] Jesus said, "You will not come to me."
[1:51:23] That's what he said. They will not come.
[1:51:24] He said, "Listen, the reason they do it
[1:51:26] is because they have rejected the
[1:51:28] fountains of living water and have drunk
[1:51:31] from a Hollywood broken sister."
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; This congregation ought to be able to
[1:51:37] scream, "Amen." Because these things
[1:51:40] have never been so true as they are
[1:51:41] today.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; And the thing is, it isn't just that I'm
[1:51:49] speaking these things to this
[1:51:50] congregation. I'm speaking these things
[1:51:51] to this congregation because of the
[1:51:53] environment that we live in and we must
[1:51:56] not become accustomed to it.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; We must not say, "Well, I see so much of
[1:52:01] it. It must be okay."
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; That doesn't make it okay simply because
[1:52:06] we see a lot of it. Or even if we see it
[1:52:08] amongst so-called believers as such,
[1:52:11] that still doesn't make it okay. It's
[1:52:13] not all right. Amen.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; I would sooner be more straight than
[1:52:19] more loose.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; I would sooner have the standard higher
[1:52:24] than lower.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; AND SO I MIGHT SAY AS I PONDERED this
[1:52:29] this morning, the prophet was speaking
[1:52:31] about the churches. He said, and they
[1:52:34] would say, "HOW DO THESE THINGS come
[1:52:36] in?" And the question is, not how did
[1:52:39] the sheep get out? How did the sheep get
[1:52:42] out? It wasn't that so much. How did the
[1:52:44] goats get in? Is because they lowered
[1:52:47] the standard and the goats began to feel
[1:52:50] very comfortable amongst the sheep.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; He said because they've rejected the
[1:52:59] fountain of living water and have drunk
[1:53:01] from Hollywood broken sistns. Listen. He
[1:53:04] says then and I have this underlined.
[1:53:06] America has refused Christ as their God.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; And received a woman as their God.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; I say that is a thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; They have refused God, Christ as their
[1:53:22] God and received a woman as their God or
[1:53:25] women as their God. What have they done?
[1:53:28] He said they stripped their clothes.
[1:53:31] Oh, he said it's a disgrace for a decent
[1:53:33] person to walk the streets in any city.
[1:53:36] What does it show? You know how long
[1:53:38] this is? 1956. Because he says, God,
[1:53:42] America rejected
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; their day in 1956. And he says there's
[1:53:48] no redemption for him. Years later, I
[1:53:51] heard Billy Graham ask the same
[1:53:54] question. Brother Brandham doesn't ask
[1:53:56] it. He states it. He said, ' And that
[1:53:58] shows just exactly what's in a woman's
[1:54:00] heart. Jesus said, "By their fruit, you
[1:54:03] shall know them. I'm still on the
[1:54:04] subject of the vine."
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham goes from an
[1:54:09] individual on the street to the nature
[1:54:11] of the WHOLE NATION. I PLANTED you as a
[1:54:14] noble vine.
[1:54:16] America was planted as a godly noble
[1:54:19] vine. And I'm sure that in the heart OF
[1:54:22] GOD HE IS SAYING HOW DID IT BECOME SUCH
[1:54:27] A DEGENERATE PLANT.
[1:54:29] HOW AND WHERE DID THESE THINGS come
[1:54:31] from? I would say somewhere between
[1:54:34] Plymouth Rock and September of 205 the
[1:54:38] bars have come way down. And how the
[1:54:41] sheep got out is because the goats were
[1:54:42] let in. Influences were led in. vile
[1:54:47] influences were allowed to come in INTO
[1:54:49] THE POLITICS AND into the schools into
[1:54:52] the whole education system. And I think
[1:54:55] for my part, brother, sister, I think
[1:54:57] the further we can live from it, the
[1:54:59] better. even though we're in the midst
[1:55:01] OF IT TO SEPARATE ourselves from it.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Said you become a strange plant.
[1:55:16] Now,
[1:55:18] I didn't give you the title to this
[1:55:20] message,
[1:55:23] but I did give a title to it. It might
[1:55:25] not be the best of grammar,
[1:55:28] but it's a question. Are the branches
[1:55:32] being broken off?
[1:55:41] There are some things that may
[1:55:44] and I'll be about another 10 minutes.
[1:55:46] There are some things
[1:55:50] as I said at the very beginning of the
[1:55:52] service that may be difficult to connect
[1:55:54] or you may wonder how they connect.
[1:55:58] I
[1:56:00] it's just myself now, brother Ed Bisll.
[1:56:04] I feel that it's more than a coincidence
[1:56:10] that under the powerful persuasion of
[1:56:15] America in her present state,
[1:56:19] not the brothers from the Plymouth Rock
[1:56:21] when they arrived, but where America is
[1:56:24] today, that their mentality and their
[1:56:27] mindset.
[1:56:29] And the scripture says Paul saying to
[1:56:34] the Gentiles,
[1:56:36] "Boast not thyself
[1:56:39] against the branches, the original
[1:56:41] branch,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; which was Israel. Don't boast thyself
[1:56:46] against the original branch,
[1:56:49] as if you do that, lest thou also be
[1:56:54] broken off." Right.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; And the word in and I was away. And
[1:57:00] while I was away, that be to actually
[1:57:04] speak to me. I almost became troubled
[1:57:06] over. I I need to find out exactly what
[1:57:09] Apostle Paul is saying. And the word
[1:57:12] boast in the Greek that he uses is that
[1:57:15] DON'T LIFT YOURSELF up to the injury of
[1:57:19] another.
[1:57:21] SO DON'T LIFT YOURSELF UP AGAINST
[1:57:24] ISRAEL, which is the vine, because
[1:57:28] you're JUST A BRANCH THAT'S BEEN GRAFTED
[1:57:30] IN. AND THE BLESSINGS YOU HAVE, AND THE
[1:57:33] FATNESS THEREOF IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE
[1:57:36] PRINCIPLES OF THE WORD OF GOD. AND THE
[1:57:38] COVENANTS CAME BY THE WORD OF GOD. THE
[1:57:41] COVENANTS CAME BY ISRAEL. AND THE
[1:57:44] PROMISES CAME BY ISRAEL. AND THE FATNESS
[1:57:47] IN FACT IS IF YOU TAKE EVEN EVEN ALL OF
[1:57:50] THE uh uh many OF OUR LAWS THAT WE HAVE
[1:57:53] IN OUR COURTS COME OUT OF THIS BOOK
[1:57:56] RIGHT HERE. THEY'RE PART OF THE
[1:57:57] COVENANTS. EVEN THE THINGS THAT UH MANY
[1:58:00] OF THE UNIONS and for THE BETTERMENT OF
[1:58:02] THE SOCIAL STATUS AND THE SOCIAL NET TO
[1:58:06] CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER AND ALL OF THOSE
[1:58:08] MATTERS COME OUT OF THE WORD OF GOD. AND
[1:58:11] THIS THIS IS THE ROOT.
[1:58:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ROOT AND US GENTILES HAVE
[1:58:19] ONLY BEEN GRAFTED IN AND WE'VE BEEN
[1:58:21] SAPPING. AND APOSTLE PAUL, THE FIRST
[1:58:23] MESSENGER SAYS, "DON'T BOAST YOURSELF
[1:58:26] AGAINST THE BRANCHES. DON'T LIFT
[1:58:28] YOURSELF UP TO THEIR INJURY."
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; AND THE GENTILES, THE LAST GREAT NATION,
[1:58:34] THE PROPHET SAID, THE GREATEST NATION
[1:58:36] THAT'S EVER BEEN HAS BEEN AMERICA. HER
[1:58:39] GREATNESS COMES BECAUSE HER SHE WAS
[1:58:42] GRAFTED IN TO THIS RIGHT HERE.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; AND HER FOREFATHERS CAME TO THIS LAND TO
[1:58:48] GET FREEDOM TO WORSHIP GOD ACCORDING TO
[1:58:51] THE WORD OF GOD AND TO SHAKE OFF ALL THE
[1:58:54] BONDAGE OF ROME.
[1:58:57] LET THE PEOPLE SAY AMEN. YOU UNDERSTAND?
[1:59:00] I'VE BEEN BUILDING FOR OVER AN HOUR TO
[1:59:02] COME TO THIS POINT. BOAST NOT THYSELF
[1:59:05] AGAINST THE BRANCHES. DON'T LIFT
[1:59:07] YOURSELF UP TO THEIR INJURY. AND RIGHT
[1:59:09] AT THIS TIME, AT THIS VERY TIME HERE, A
[1:59:12] A NATION BECAUSE OF THEIR POWER, BECAUSE
[1:59:15] OF THEIR WEALTH, BECAUSE OF THEIR
[1:59:16] MILITARY STRENGTH, THEY HAVE THE
[1:59:19] WHEREWITHAL, BECAUSE THEY'RE LISTENED TO
[1:59:21] BY ALL NATIONS OF THE WORLD. AND SO THE
[1:59:23] LEADERS CAN SAY TO ISRAEL, "WE HAVE THE
[1:59:27] ROAD MAP TO YOUR PEACE.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE THE ROAD MAP FOR PEACE." GOD
[1:59:34] HATES THAT STATEMENT.
[1:59:36] THIS IS THE ROAD MAP FOR PEACE. AND
[1:59:38] THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD MAP. THIS IS THE
[1:59:41] ROAD MAP.
[1:59:43] AND BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE THAT'S PUT
[1:59:45] UPON THAT NATION AGAINST THE ORIGINAL
[1:59:48] VINE, THE PRESSURE THAT'S PUT ON THAT
[1:59:50] ORIGINAL VINE, THEY PUT SUCH PRESSURE ON
[1:59:53] IT UNTIL THEY SUCCUMB TO IT AND THEY
[1:59:55] BEGIN TO DRAG OFF DRAG OFF THEIR OWN
[1:59:59] RESIDENCE OFF OF THEIR INHERITANCE.
[2:00:03] IT WOULD BE LIKE ME SAYING, "AH, I HAVE
[2:00:06] A GREAT SPIRITUAL HERITAGE." AND SEE YOU
[2:00:08] YOUNG FELLAS AND YOU YOUNG LADIES
[2:00:10] STARTING TO REACH OUT INTO THE SPIRITUAL
[2:00:12] THING. AND I WOULD DRAW YOU BACK AND
[2:00:14] PULL YOU FROM THAT AND PUT PRESSURE ON
[2:00:16] YOU TO NOT NOT ATTAIN THOSE SPIRITUAL
[2:00:19] THINGS. COME BACK. YOU CAN LIVE AN
[2:00:21] EASIER LIFE IN THE WORLD. THERE'S AN
[2:00:23] EASIER LIFE FOR YOU. AND YOU DON'T HAVE
[2:00:25] TO TAKE IT SO SERIOUS. AND WE DON'T HAVE
[2:00:27] TO LIVE UH EVERYTHING THAT THE PROPHETS
[2:00:29] OF GOD HAVE SAID. I'D BE DRAGGING.
[2:00:31] THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THE LEADERS IN
[2:00:32] ISRAEL ARE DOING. BUT THEY'RE BEING
[2:00:34] PRESSURED PRESSURED BY THE RICHEST AND
[2:00:37] THE MOST POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH WHO
[2:00:40] HAD WHO WAS PLANTED A NOBLE VINE IN THE
[2:00:43] BEGINNING BUT HAS BECOME A DEGENERATE
[2:00:45] PLANT.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; AND RIGHT WHILE THE ACTION IS TAKING
[2:00:52] PLACE, IT MIGHT MEAN NOTHING TO NO ONE
[2:00:54] HERE, BUT IT MEANS A PROFOUND THINGS TO
[2:00:56] ME. RIGHT. WHILE THEY'RE PHYSICALLY JEW,
[2:00:59] PULLING JEW OFF OF THEIR INHERITANCE,
[2:01:02] RIGHT OFF THEIR LAND,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; a city of this degenerate plant, BECOMES
[2:01:11] DESECRATED BY A GREAT FORCE THAT COMES
[2:01:14] OUT OF NOWHERE, BUILDS OUT OVER THE
[2:01:17] GULF, AND IT COMES WITH A GREAT FORCE
[2:01:20] AND BEGINS TO DESTROY WHAT the the the
[2:01:23] THE PLACE OF THAT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE
[2:01:26] MOST VILE
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; IN AMERICA.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; I'm just starting, friends.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; BOAST NOT THYSELF,
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; LEST YOU ALSO BE BROKEN OFF. AND I ASK A
[2:01:45] QUESTION. IS IT AN ACCIDENT? OR IS IT A
[2:01:47] COINCIDENCE THAT WHILE ISRAEL BY THE
[2:01:50] PRESSURE OF THIS GREAT POWER IS PULLING
[2:01:52] THEIR PEOPLE OFF OF THE INHERITANCE OF
[2:01:54] THE WORD OF GOD WHICH IS DIRECTLY
[2:01:57] CONTRARY TO THIS WORD? AND WHILE THAT'S
[2:01:59] HAPPENING, HERE COMES A STORM AND COMES
[2:02:02] TO A A WICKED, VILE CITY. A CITY THAT IS
[2:02:06] PREPARING TO HAVE WHAT THEY CALL A
[2:02:08] CELEBRATION OF DECADENCE
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS TO HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME
[2:02:14] HURRICANE KATRINA CAME UPON THE CITY.
[2:02:16] THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING WHAT
[2:02:18] THEY CALL THE 34TH ANNUAL CELEBRATION OF
[2:02:22] DECADENCE AND THEY WERE EXPECTING
[2:02:24] 125,000 PLUS BECAUSE THEY HAD 125,000
[2:02:28] LAST YEAR. AND THESE ARE HOMOSEXUAL AND
[2:02:31] UH AND LESBIAN TYPE OF PEOPLE AND
[2:02:34] EVERYONE ELSE WHO WHO CONDONES IT AND
[2:02:37] MARCHING THROUGH THE STREETS IN THEIR
[2:02:39] ABSOLUTE DEBAUCHERY AND NAKEDNESS AND
[2:02:42] GOD JUST DECIDED IT'S NOT GOING TO
[2:02:45] HAPPEN.
[2:02:48] It's not going to happen
[2:02:51] AND IT WON'T HAPPEN
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; PERHAPS FOR YEARS TO COME. AND I TRUST
[2:02:55] IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I THINK THAT
[2:02:59] STORM? I'M NOT SAYING WHAT IT WAS OR HOW
[2:03:02] IT WAS, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVEN
[2:03:04] NOW, EVEN TODAY, AS OF THIS MORNING,
[2:03:06] THEY'RE STILL SAYING WHAT WENT WRONG.
[2:03:10] WE HAD A WHOLE AIRBORNE DIVISION OF
[2:03:12] AMERICAN PILOTS AND AIRPLANES TO CARRY
[2:03:15] PEOPLE AND THEY WERE WAITING FOR A CALL.
[2:03:17] NEVER GOT THE CALL. THE AMTRAK TRAIN WAS
[2:03:20] SITTING WAITING TO TAKE OUT EVACUEES AND
[2:03:23] NEVER GOT A CALL. NEVER HAULED ANYBODY
[2:03:25] OUT. A HOSPITAL SHIP WAITED OFF TO GET A
[2:03:28] CALL. IT WAS A 300 BED HOSPITAL SHIP
[2:03:31] NEVER GOT A CALL.
[2:03:34] While 90 miles of the Gulf Coast was
[2:03:38] decimated,
[2:03:41] they said GUSTS OF THE HURRICANE flung
[2:03:44] water into the streets in storm surges
[2:03:47] as high as 25 ft. I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND
[2:03:49] A LOT OF TIME ON this because you've
[2:03:51] been probably overdone with it already.
[2:03:54] They said it was like HOUSES WERE
[2:03:56] PLAYING BUMPER cars
[2:03:59] around here. One observer said coffins
[2:04:04] out of the out of the graveyard came
[2:04:06] floating down the beach. BOATS WERE
[2:04:10] PERCHED UP IN THE TREES.
[2:04:12] The levies then ruptured after this
[2:04:16] flooding 80% of the city. AND NOT ONLY
[2:04:17] THAT, WHEN THE STORM WENT BY, PROBABLY
[2:04:20] ONE OF THE MOST VILE DISTRICTS, WHICH
[2:04:22] WAS THE FRENCH DISTRICT, THEY BEGAN TO
[2:04:24] REJOICE THAT THEY HAD MISSED it when the
[2:04:27] levies broke loose and the water poured
[2:04:29] IN AND FLOODING 80% OF the entire city,
[2:04:33] leaving a 100,000 people stranded as the
[2:04:37] temperature soared. One writer said,
[2:04:40] commentator, he said, "The temperature
[2:04:42] rose and the whole city was poached in a
[2:04:46] vile stew of melted landfill, chemicals,
[2:04:51] corpses, gasoline, snakes, and canal
[2:04:54] rats." Out of the Time magazine, "The
[2:04:57] sick in hospitals without power,
[2:05:00] medication soon ran out, and evacuation
[2:05:03] was all but impossible." They said
[2:05:06] hundreds of thousands were without food
[2:05:09] and water or shelter of any kind.
[2:05:12] Families separated and moved to
[2:05:14] different states and still remain
[2:05:16] separated and children who will never
[2:05:19] see the the school they ever went to and
[2:05:22] separated from their families and uh uh
[2:05:25] different organizations now are trying
[2:05:27] to put the families together. Businesses
[2:05:29] and jobs and schools and even personal
[2:05:32] identity was gone. As one man says, I
[2:05:35] don't even have an address.
[2:05:37] I'm an I I'm I'm just a no one. I'm a
[2:05:40] nobody. I don't have an address. And of
[2:05:43] all things, I thought, how how I I read
[2:05:46] considerable about it and I I because I
[2:05:49] this was on my mind are the branches
[2:05:52] being broken off.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; And for my part, I say we had a prophet.
[2:05:58] He already declared it. HE SPOKE ABOUT
[2:06:00] THE ECONOMY. HE SPOKE ABOUT THE
[2:06:02] IMMORALITY. HE ZEROED in to the various
[2:06:05] places where IT WAS SO INIQUITOUS. WE
[2:06:08] USED TO IMPORT IT FROM PARIS AND NOW WE
[2:06:11] EXPORT IT BACK TO PARIS. I TELL YOU
[2:06:13] WHAT, MY BROTHER, my sister, the
[2:06:15] messenger spoke in general terms, but
[2:06:17] we're seeing very vividly before OUR
[2:06:19] EYES IN DETAIL HOW THAT REALLY MEANT.
[2:06:22] PAUL SAID, THE BRANCH HAS BEEN BORE
[2:06:24] BROKEN OFF. AND I SAID, THAT IS TRUE.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; APOSTLE PAUL, GOD BLESS YOU. THAT'S
[2:06:29] EXACTLY RIGHT. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A
[2:06:32] PROPHET THAT YOU BELIEVE IN SAYS IN 1956
[2:06:34] THEY TURNED AWAY FROM GOD. THAT MAY
[2:06:36] SOUND A LONG TIME AGO. SOME OF YOU
[2:06:38] WEREN'T EVEN BORN, BUT YOU'RE LIVING TO
[2:06:39] SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; You think it's going to come back?
[2:06:46] Never.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Never. You think a MORAL CONDITION IS
[2:06:49] GOING TO COME BACK? AND I have read
[2:06:51] volumes of of things that happened and
[2:06:53] statements of leaders and all the rest
[2:06:55] of it to SAY IF THERE'S ONE PLACE WAS
[2:06:58] THERE ONE PERSON WAS THERE ONE RECORD of
[2:07:01] anyone saying we need to repent
[2:07:06] doesn't exist.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Doesn't exist.
[2:07:10] THERE'S NO CALL FOR PRAYER. NO CALL THAT
[2:07:15] PEOPLE PERHAPS THIS IS GOD TRYING TO
[2:07:17] SPEAK TO US. NO CALL. WHY? BECAUSE THE
[2:07:20] MINDS HAVE BE ALREADY BECOME SEARED
[2:07:23] ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURE AND
[2:07:24] REPENTANCE IS AN INNER HEART.
[2:07:28] THEY SHOWED ONE woman and and it just
[2:07:32] just that was as of this morning just
[2:07:33] showed one woman laying beside the
[2:07:35] corpse of her and so they said common
[2:07:38] law husband
[2:07:41] livein
[2:07:42] husband
[2:07:44] perhaps my wife said perhaps they
[2:07:46] couldn't find a married couple I don't
[2:07:48] know that perhaps extreme but I tell you
[2:07:51] what today friends you and I better wake
[2:07:54] upmen
[2:07:56] It's not something that's coming. It's
[2:07:57] something that's already here.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; They said an estimated 10,000 workers
[2:08:08] who lost their jobs because of the
[2:08:10] hurricane filed for unemployment last
[2:08:12] week. In one week, 10,000
[2:08:16] for unemployment.
[2:08:18] They've got to find the the whole
[2:08:21] economy is completely devastated.
[2:08:28] you know, will it build up?
[2:08:30] Sure, probably will. I don't know
[2:08:32] whether we'll see it or not,
[2:08:35] but I can tell you that the news
[2:08:37] reporters probably gave all kinds of
[2:08:39] details about what happened to Sodom and
[2:08:41] Gomorrah.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; They weren't really touched. Maybe they
[2:08:44] were in the other end of the country.
[2:08:46] All they did was see the smoke rise.
[2:08:51] There may be some that all they did is
[2:08:53] said I've talked to some said all we got
[2:08:54] was it got cooler where we are. We
[2:08:57] actually were happy it got cool because
[2:08:59] of the hurricane Katrina. It was it
[2:09:02] cooled off our area.
[2:09:04] So people can have all kinds of you know
[2:09:07] what went wrong and and all kinds of
[2:09:09] analyses about what happened and and and
[2:09:11] so on and so forth. But on the big
[2:09:13] screen I'm trying to get you to come up
[2:09:17] from a different perspective today. and
[2:09:20] say because I can assure you there has
[2:09:24] never been a world power that tampered
[2:09:27] with Israel that remained a world power.
[2:09:30] You and I are seeing a demise
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; of the strongest and richest of nations
[2:09:36] on earth.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; WE'RE SEEING IT IN ITS DEATH THROWS.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; AND I'M NOT SAYING THE ECONOMY COLLAPSE
[2:09:46] IT. IT MAY GO WILDER AND BETTER THAN
[2:09:49] EVER BEFORE, BUT IT'S IT'S STILL A IT'S
[2:09:52] A FACADE.
[2:09:55] AMEN.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; THE DEBT AS OF THIS MORNING, THE
[2:09:59] NATIONAL DEBT IS 7 TRILLION
[2:10:04] 782
[2:10:05] billion816
[2:10:09] MILLION546,362
[2:10:16] and it amounted to $26,000.
[2:10:19] Every American person is indeent. Every
[2:10:22] baby, child, and person is indebted
[2:10:26] 26,000 more than we thought we were.
[2:10:32] That's as of this morning.
[2:10:35] The nations of the world don't have a
[2:10:37] lot of confidence.
[2:10:39] And you might not realize that one
[2:10:41] nation can just take a little step.
[2:10:44] And it was President de Gaul of France
[2:10:47] in the 1960s. He decided that he wanted
[2:10:50] to call he wanted to America to recall
[2:10:54] all of their paper.
[2:10:56] They said, "Give us gold.
[2:11:00] All these hundreds of millions of
[2:11:02] dollars we're holding IN AMERICAN PAPER.
[2:11:05] WE DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE IN IT ANYMORE.
[2:11:07] TAKE IT BACK and give us gold." Gold was
[2:11:10] at $35 an ounce and just in a short time
[2:11:14] it was up over $700 an ounce. And the
[2:11:17] gold has never been the same since.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; It shook the whole economy for the time.
[2:11:24] And of course they said within the
[2:11:26] senators within America said, "Why don't
[2:11:28] we call on them to pay their war debt,
[2:11:31] which is about the same amount as our
[2:11:33] paper that's in their country." For
[2:11:36] myself, I would said that's what they
[2:11:37] should have done. They should have made
[2:11:39] them pay their war debt that they owe
[2:11:42] America. But America's generous. America
[2:11:45] isn't only prosperous, they're generous
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; and they've befriended, they've
[2:11:52] purchased friends by protecting them.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; But also, friends, they have received
[2:11:59] the greatest voice
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; that has ever sounded.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; As far AS I'M CONCERNED, OUTSIDE OF
[2:12:07] JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF,
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; THERE'S BEEN NO VOICE THAT HAS HAD SUCH
[2:12:11] AN EFFECT. AND IT'S AN INCREASING
[2:12:14] EFFECT.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S IN A VOICE OF TRUTH.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; So just days,
[2:12:31] just days. And right while
[2:12:37] you must say it right while their
[2:12:40] foreign
[2:12:42] representatives
[2:12:46] is this all right
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; and condies of rice
[2:12:51] foreign ministers
[2:12:53] and you must understand
[2:12:58] don't ever forget that when anyone
[2:13:00] begins to tamper with Israel
[2:13:03] They're playing right into the hand of
[2:13:05] God.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; And I believe that America's been
[2:13:11] blessed to this point because they've
[2:13:13] been a friend of America. I mean,
[2:13:15] they've been a friend of Israel.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; And Israel, their forefather, is
[2:13:19] Abraham, who is a friend of God.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; You heard me speak.
[2:13:25] They're a friend of the friend of God.
[2:13:29] And that's why God has blessed them.
[2:13:31] There's never been a nation that's ever
[2:13:33] risen to where they've risen to.
[2:13:37] But are the branches being broken off?
[2:13:40] And so, right, while they are in not
[2:13:43] only in full agreement, I've used up my
[2:13:46] time now. Not only in full agreement,
[2:13:49] but they have also, listen, just give me
[2:13:52] a couple more minutes.
[2:13:56] And the 1967 war, which you know and I
[2:13:59] know in Israel is nothing short of a
[2:14:01] supernatural war, was fought in five or
[2:14:04] six days. And it's the only war in
[2:14:06] history that was paid for before it was
[2:14:08] finished.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; They had actually paid for it. The Jews
[2:14:12] came from all over the world and gave
[2:14:15] gave their funds and had the war paid
[2:14:17] for before it was done. And it was done.
[2:14:19] It took everybody by surprise. And then
[2:14:22] the the Sinai desert became the buffer
[2:14:25] between Egypt and Israel. God through
[2:14:29] that little nation fought against tens
[2:14:31] of millions.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; The odds ARE INSURMOUNTABLE. I'VE GOT
[2:14:36] THE PICTURES. I HAPPEN TO have the
[2:14:39] pictures where Egypt had prepared for
[2:14:42] this war and they had dummy bomber
[2:14:45] planes on the ground and they'd have a
[2:14:48] dummy plane and a real one and maybe two
[2:14:51] dummies and a real one and then a and
[2:14:53] then another dummy and a real one and um
[2:14:56] and the Israeli Air Force flew in AND SO
[2:15:00] SUDDENLY THAT MORNING AND I'VE GOT THE
[2:15:02] PICTURES OF THE AIR STRIPS AND THEY
[2:15:04] BOMBED AND WHEN THEY BOMBED THEY HIT the
[2:15:06] real ones and left the dummies.
[2:15:09] I TELL YOU WHAT, FRIENDS, OUR GOD IS
[2:15:11] GOD.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; I read a reporter, a woman reporter that
[2:15:16] was in a was IN A JEEP IN A CONVOY THAT
[2:15:19] WAS THAT WAS SHOOTING DOWN THROUGH THE
[2:15:22] SINAI DESERT AND SHE SAID THAT THAT
[2:15:25] SUDDENLY the the the jeep that was in
[2:15:27] THE LEAD JUST SWERVED and went off into
[2:15:30] the off the road because there's no
[2:15:32] ditches or anything. It just desert
[2:15:33] swerved and went off the ROAD AND ALL
[2:15:35] THE OTHERS FOLLOWED. AND THE last jeep
[2:15:38] was quite a ways behind and went
[2:15:40] straight through and was blew up because
[2:15:43] there was a there was some landmines
[2:15:45] that were there and a man or two
[2:15:47] whatever was in the last jeep was was
[2:15:50] killed. But the but the the convoy
[2:15:52] itself was preserved and got on and they
[2:15:55] she got to the leader and said, "Why did
[2:15:58] you swerve and go off?" HE SAID, "I SAW
[2:16:01] A BIG BALL OF FIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF the
[2:16:03] road and I turned off." HALLELUJAH. IT'S
[2:16:07] THE SAME GOD.
[2:16:09] I could tell you on and on and on. I
[2:16:11] knew two WOMEN THAT HAD GONE there in
[2:16:13] the 1940s and 50s as missionaries. And
[2:16:16] in one of the wars in 1956, I believe it
[2:16:18] was. And one of my friends was living in
[2:16:21] Israel. HE SAID, "WE ONLY HAD
[2:16:22] BROOMSTICKS TO PROTECT OURSELVES." AND
[2:16:25] EVERY MAN MADE HIS MADE HIS HOLE MADE
[2:16:27] his uh foxhole in HIS OWN PROPERTY ON
[2:16:30] HIS OWN LOT AND SAYS WE DON'T HAVE ANY
[2:16:32] PLACE TO GO. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF LOSING
[2:16:34] A WAR. WE DON'T HAVE A LAND. WE DON'T
[2:16:37] HAVE ANY IDENTITY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY
[2:16:39] PLACE TO GO. WE MUST PROTECT THIS. And
[2:16:42] they stood THERE AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE
[2:16:44] ANY WEAPONS.
[2:16:47] and in the ingenuity of their mind
[2:16:50] because God gave them that kind of
[2:16:51] ingenuity. They took drums, EMPTY
[2:16:54] 45GALLON DRUMS AND PUT ALL KINDS OF
[2:16:57] STONES AND ROCKS IN THEM AND THEY HAD
[2:17:00] THEM UP ON TOP OF THIS HILL AND AND WHEN
[2:17:02] THE SYRIANS BEGAN TO COME AND INVADE,
[2:17:05] they they took AND THEY IN THE NIGHTTIME
[2:17:07] THEY STARTED THESE DRUMS DOWN THE
[2:17:09] MOUNTAIN SIDE. AND AS THOSE THINGS JUST
[2:17:12] RUMBLED DOWN THAT MOUNTAIN SIDE, ALL
[2:17:13] THOSE ROCKS MAKING ALL THAT NOISE AND
[2:17:16] THE SYRIANS FLED BECAUSE THEY SAID THE
[2:17:18] AMERICANS HAVE GIVEN THEM TANKS.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; I I TELL YOU WHAT, I REJOICE OVER THESE
[2:17:26] THINGS.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; And God knows how to bring things on. He
[2:17:34] knows how to do things. And when you
[2:17:36] begin to tamper with them,
[2:17:39] and this is from Philadelphia
[2:17:42] just days before, it wasn't celebration
[2:17:45] of decadence. They called it southern
[2:17:46] decadence. An annual homosexual
[2:17:49] celebration attracting tens of thousands
[2:17:51] of people to the French Quarters section
[2:17:55] of New Orleans. An act of God destroys
[2:17:58] the city. Southern Decadence has a
[2:18:00] history of filling the French Quarter
[2:18:03] section of the city with drunken
[2:18:06] homosexuals engaging in sex acts in
[2:18:09] public streets and bars. And last year,
[2:18:12] just last year, they had 125,000. Listen
[2:18:15] now. A local pastor in New Orleans sent
[2:18:19] a video footage of sex acts being
[2:18:22] performed in front of POLICEMEN
[2:18:26] AND HE SENT IT TO THE MAYOR of the city
[2:18:28] AND THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE MEDIA. And
[2:18:32] the city officials simply ignored the
[2:18:34] footage and continued to welcome and
[2:18:37] praise the week-long celebration as
[2:18:40] being an exciting event. However,
[2:18:44] Hurricane Katrina has put an end to the
[2:18:47] annual celebration of Sam,
[2:18:57] the past three mayors of New Orleans,
[2:19:00] including City Bartholomew,
[2:19:03] Mark H. Mor Moral, and C. Ray Negan,
[2:19:10] who's been very much in the papers these
[2:19:12] days, they issued and I read Mayor
[2:19:15] Negan's letter. I read his letter of of
[2:19:21] inviting this celebration to this city
[2:19:27] and they issued official proclamations
[2:19:29] welcoming visitors to southern
[2:19:32] decadence. Additionally, New Orleans
[2:19:35] City Council made other proclamations
[2:19:38] recognizing the annual homosexual
[2:19:41] celebration.
[2:19:43] And while the mayors accepted it and
[2:19:46] invited it, God saw fit. And it wasn't
[2:19:49] just a storm, friends. It's not just
[2:19:51] that. Listen, not that they will come
[2:19:54] and go. I'm saying this is a sign to us
[2:19:57] because I've laid out in detail very
[2:20:00] much scripture and very many quotes from
[2:20:02] the prophet of God so that you would sit
[2:20:04] here this morning and KNOW THIS IS NOT A
[2:20:07] COINCIDENCE.
[2:20:08] THIS IS NOT AN ACCIDENT AND THIS IS NOT
[2:20:11] JUST ANOTHER STORM. GOD IS SAYING YOU'RE
[2:20:14] TAMPERING WITH THE VINE AND I'M GOING TO
[2:20:17] BREAK YOU OFF.
[2:20:27] Brother Brandham had a vision. And
[2:20:29] listen close now as I close
[2:20:34] is after he lost his wife and his baby.
[2:20:38] This was quite early
[2:20:40] and he didn't know whether it was real
[2:20:42] or whether he was in a dream or whether
[2:20:44] he was in a vision or he didn't know if
[2:20:45] he was actually there. body. He sees a a
[2:20:49] covered wagon, a western covered wagon.
[2:20:51] He said it always wanted to be out west.
[2:20:53] Sees this covered wagon
[2:20:56] and the wheel is broken
[2:20:59] and it can't go where it was supposed to
[2:21:02] go or where it was determined to go. And
[2:21:06] he said, "That covered wagon is my
[2:21:08] family." He knew it was his family
[2:21:12] because his family was broken by the
[2:21:14] death of his wife and his baby.
[2:21:19] But while he was there, he said, and
[2:21:21] here came a lovely young lady.
[2:21:24] She says, "Hi, Dad."
[2:21:28] He said, "Excuse me, how can you call me
[2:21:31] dad?"
[2:21:33] She says, "Don't you know me? I'm Sharon
[2:21:35] Rose."
[2:21:37] and and mother's waiting for you
[2:21:41] and you have a mansion.
[2:21:44] That's not possible. He says, "We're
[2:21:46] Brams. We're poor people. I don't have
[2:21:50] any mansion."
[2:21:52] And she begins to talk to him and he
[2:21:53] begins to talk to her and finally meets
[2:21:56] his wife and she says to him, "I don't
[2:21:59] want to go all into it." She said,
[2:22:01] "Don't worry. I don't want you to worry
[2:22:03] anymore." And he begins to break up.
[2:22:06] He's in life story and he begins to
[2:22:07] break up and the whole thing is such a
[2:22:09] reality that he can't even continue his
[2:22:12] sermon. He breaks up and he he le he
[2:22:15] leaves the pulpit weeping so hard he
[2:22:18] can't go on because it was such a
[2:22:20] reality. You might think how this
[2:22:22] connects. I'll tell you how it connects.
[2:22:28] That is a family unit. I talked about
[2:22:30] individuals.
[2:22:31] I talked about a nation. Talked about
[2:22:35] Israel. talked about America and now I
[2:22:37] come to the only prophet that I know of,
[2:22:40] a messenger that America produced. He
[2:22:43] came out of the soil of that nation. And
[2:22:46] God also allowed that his life, his home
[2:22:50] become a broken wagon. The wheel broke
[2:22:53] and he couldn't go any place. But I'm
[2:22:56] going to tell you something. It was
[2:22:58] settled in his heart
[2:23:01] by I'd say divine inspiration that he
[2:23:05] would not change his course.
[2:23:09] He would continue on.
[2:23:12] That's what I'm saying to you young
[2:23:13] people.
[2:23:15] You must not change your course. I don't
[2:23:18] care what happens tomorrow. I don't care
[2:23:21] what happens with your job. I don't care
[2:23:23] what happens in your family. There's not
[2:23:27] sufficient reason to change your course.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; You may be here and your home may be
[2:23:33] broken up and the wagon wheel is broken,
[2:23:36] but don't miss the spot that he got to.
[2:23:40] He got on the other side.
[2:23:43] And I tell you, it is real. It's more
[2:23:46] real than you sitting here this morning.
[2:23:48] It's just a it's just a breath away. And
[2:23:51] with all of these things and all of
[2:23:53] these events and all this, you're going
[2:23:54] to you're going to face more. Don't
[2:23:57] change your course.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; The life that was in that prophet
[2:24:02] messenger, if brother Brandon was here,
[2:24:04] it'd be a very ordinary person. He'd
[2:24:06] just like to go with you and have lunch
[2:24:08] with you today.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; But the life that was in him, THE LIFE
[2:24:12] THAT was in that branch would not
[2:24:15] change.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; He continued to believe the same word.
[2:24:19] He always believed and CONTINUED TO
[2:24:21] PREACH IT. AND IT ONLY GOT RICHER and
[2:24:24] deeper and more glorious. And now HERE
[2:24:26] WE ARE TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT
[2:24:28] FAITHFULNESS.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; And you don't know who you're going to
[2:24:34] affect.
[2:24:36] You're going to affect somebody.
[2:24:38] I said to the young people the other
[2:24:40] day,
[2:24:42] Friday night, just a few comments before
[2:24:46] Brother John started
[2:24:49] and I said, "Brother Brandon said,
[2:24:50] there'll be a sweep." And I believe
[2:24:52] we're seeing it. I believe with all my
[2:24:55] heart and soul and I want every parent
[2:24:57] and every person that's an adult within
[2:25:00] this church. I want you to be just as as
[2:25:03] not only enthused but supportive and
[2:25:05] behind it and do whatever I can do in
[2:25:08] your prayer and in in every way that you
[2:25:10] possibly can. We we intend to build upon
[2:25:13] these things the kind of sweep that I
[2:25:16] talked about.
[2:25:18] I said here's the sweep that I'm seeing.
[2:25:21] I didn't know that brother Jess and
[2:25:22] Sister Lynn Barios would be there. But I
[2:25:25] said, I I remember Sister Lynn Barios.
[2:25:27] She yearned to be up here in Washington,
[2:25:30] be able to come to this church. I didn't
[2:25:32] even know her. And they moved up. She
[2:25:35] finally persuaded brother Jess. He
[2:25:37] wasn't, you know, he's a bread earner.
[2:25:39] He has to have a job. And he didn't want
[2:25:40] to just pull up stakes. But they were in
[2:25:42] California. And they also wanted to
[2:25:43] leave California. and and and because of
[2:25:46] Sister Lynn Barios, Brother Lynn,
[2:25:48] Brother Jess came and they they hear,
[2:25:52] "Brother Jess gets a job in a plant and
[2:25:56] he's working next to Brother Joe Graham
[2:25:59] and he witnesses to him." Brother Joe
[2:26:02] Graham and I sit down in Denny's
[2:26:04] restaurant and brother Jess said, "I
[2:26:07] couldn't take him any further. Has he
[2:26:08] called you yet?" I said, "No." But we
[2:26:10] finally made contact and brother Joe
[2:26:13] Graeme and I are talking and brother Joe
[2:26:16] looks over my head looks out the window.
[2:26:18] He says sister Bobby was managerous of
[2:26:22] two high fashion ladies wares and had
[2:26:24] promise to go higher and further and and
[2:26:27] and in that in that position of course
[2:26:30] she dressed very fashionable and all the
[2:26:32] rest of not that she doesn't today but
[2:26:34] it was the world and he looked over my
[2:26:36] head. He said, "This will probably cost
[2:26:39] my home. This will probably cost me my
[2:26:41] wife, but I'm prepared for that, too."
[2:26:46] And he was going to be baptized
[2:26:49] and went from Brother Joe to Sister
[2:26:51] Bobby.
[2:26:52] And soon she was in the tank. And then
[2:26:55] come a funeral to take place and brother
[2:26:57] Chris Peterson, he comes up. He's cousin
[2:27:00] to brother Joe and he has to get him out
[2:27:02] of this false cult. and he gets to
[2:27:05] reading a church age book and a few
[2:27:06] other books and before long he was in
[2:27:08] the tank and I knew that he he figured
[2:27:12] that probably sister cigarette would
[2:27:13] never make it. vice president of a big
[2:27:15] corporation, all the rest of it, down in
[2:27:17] San Francisco. And how is she going to,
[2:27:18] you know, what are we going to do here
[2:27:20] at this little place up here in the
[2:27:22] Boondocks of Washington and Northwest
[2:27:25] and how in the world is that going to
[2:27:26] happen soon? She was in the tank. THAT'S
[2:27:28] THE KIND OF SWEEP I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[2:27:31] [applause]
[2:27:32] few young people.
[2:27:34] Joanne isn't here today, but she was at
[2:27:37] high school
[2:27:40] and she brought a girl over from high
[2:27:42] school cuz we're just across the street.
[2:27:44] She brings a girl over from high school
[2:27:47] and sits at our table as Sister Karen
[2:27:50] Ashdown. She's sitting there in a pair,
[2:27:52] you won't mind me, Sister Karen sitting
[2:27:54] there in a pair of blue jeans. All I saw
[2:27:57] was a girl that had a heart for God. And
[2:28:00] I began to speak to her and told her
[2:28:02] about the serpent seed.
[2:28:04] Here's sister Cindy Bergen right here.
[2:28:07] And from Citra Karen, from Joanne to
[2:28:09] Sister Karen and Sister Jerry Goce,
[2:28:15] Sister Cindy Bergen
[2:28:17] was a girl about eight or nine years old
[2:28:21] and her mom and daddy are good friends
[2:28:23] of ours. And I flew from Toronto. I was
[2:28:26] waiting to go with brother Brandham and
[2:28:28] actually to work with his tape ministry
[2:28:31] which he asked me to do and I was in
[2:28:33] Toronto just waiting for that to happen
[2:28:36] and I flew from Toronto to Dawson Creek
[2:28:39] to dedicate the church and went out from
[2:28:41] there to Grandpa Haney's place
[2:28:45] man that we called grandpa he was an
[2:28:46] elder in the church and her mom and dad
[2:28:49] Cindy's mom and dad sitting around the
[2:28:51] table and her uncle and her aunt and
[2:28:53] grandpa Haney and his wife and myself
[2:28:55] were all sitting around the table and
[2:28:57] I'm pouring out my heart and soul these
[2:28:59] people I love like my own family and I'm
[2:29:03] just speaking to them about and I and I
[2:29:05] got into the serpent seed to me it's a
[2:29:07] foundation doctrine I began to speak
[2:29:09] about the serpent seed
[2:29:12] I didn't see any fruits from it years
[2:29:14] went by finished in Toronto came back
[2:29:17] out here
[2:29:18] was out here and here starts a little
[2:29:20] group and we're in a little house
[2:29:24] and Linda and Cindy about the same age
[2:29:26] says, "I want to fly up and see Cindy."
[2:29:29] Cindy is a lab technician and a medical
[2:29:31] lab technician.
[2:29:33] A young lady now. All these years have
[2:29:36] gone by. 10 years have gone by.
[2:29:39] I'm talking about a sweep of the Holy
[2:29:41] Spirit.
[2:29:43] And then Cindy came down and visited us.
[2:29:47] I don't know how it happened. We were
[2:29:49] sitting in the front room. I'm sitting
[2:29:51] right across just like you fellas are
[2:29:52] from me. Now, here's this young young
[2:29:55] lovely
[2:29:58] girl
[2:30:00] just launched out into the workforce
[2:30:03] and Linda and the kids are gone and my
[2:30:05] wife's in the kitchen and I begin to
[2:30:08] speak to Cindy and I speak to her and I
[2:30:11] come to the serpent's seed. I don't know
[2:30:13] what else to say. Just she had to know
[2:30:16] this message is different. This message
[2:30:18] is the truth of God's word. And I just
[2:30:20] began to lay it out from the scripture.
[2:30:23] And she says to me, "Do you remember
[2:30:26] when you spoke to mom and dad about this
[2:30:29] at Grandpa Haney's farm?" I said, "Yes,
[2:30:32] I certainly do. I remember sitting
[2:30:34] around the dining room table." She said,
[2:30:38] "Did you see me standing there?"
[2:30:41] I said, "No."
[2:30:43] I said, "I all I heard all you kids
[2:30:45] outside playing.
[2:30:47] I didn't see you. I didn't know any of
[2:30:49] the were inside. She says, I was
[2:30:52] standing at the table
[2:30:54] listening to you and I've wanted to hear
[2:30:57] this ever since.
[2:31:00] And since today, Brother Rod's wife and
[2:31:03] their family and children here, that's
[2:31:05] the kind of sweep. And I'm telling you
[2:31:07] young people, that's the kind of
[2:31:08] influence that's what God has done in
[2:31:11] your hearts and in your lives. And you
[2:31:13] may come your life may experience some
[2:31:17] things that you it might might be like a
[2:31:19] broken wheel in your home or your family
[2:31:21] or your life or whatever more. Don't
[2:31:24] under any condition let that change your
[2:31:27] course.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; You stay the course. Apostle Paul stayed
[2:31:32] the course. Brother Brown stayed the
[2:31:34] course. I've done my best to stay the
[2:31:36] course.
[2:31:41] And my life was not easy. I wouldn't
[2:31:44] wish it upon any of you. But even though
[2:31:47] if God never showed my my home and my
[2:31:50] life is being a broken wagon, but it
[2:31:53] didn't go. I just counted yesterday or
[2:31:56] the day before yesterday. I lost 50
[2:31:58] years of mother and dad. 50 years of
[2:32:02] life of being able to be with them cuz
[2:32:04] mom went so young. I lost 50 years.
[2:32:09] My mother never able to see my children,
[2:32:12] never able to see her grandchildren,
[2:32:14] never able. But there's a landlord.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, I need you to help me.
[2:32:21] Second, there's a land beyond the river
[2:32:25] that they call the sweet forever.
[2:32:28] We've got sick people.
[2:32:31] I might as well be honest. There's
[2:32:32] people that's close to death from our
[2:32:35] congregation.
[2:32:37] And before next Sunday, they might be
[2:32:39] gone. Before Brother Donaldson preaches,
[2:32:41] they might be gone. But whoever you are
[2:32:44] that's connected to them, do not change
[2:32:47] the course. Nothing can change. And what
[2:32:50] am I talking about? I'm talking about
[2:32:52] that life that's in the vine. Just keep
[2:32:54] giving yourself, surrender yourself to
[2:32:57] that blessed, blessed divine nature of
[2:33:00] God and never want to change it. Are you
[2:33:04] with me?
[2:33:07] I'm so glad that nothing changed. I was
[2:33:10] so glad after I got to be with brother
[2:33:13] Brandham that all that power and all
[2:33:15] that
[2:33:18] people and popularity and everything
[2:33:20] never changed and he just remembered
[2:33:21] remained a humble servant of Christ. And
[2:33:25] it's had a profound effect upon my life.
[2:33:28] And I the little testimonies I gave you,
[2:33:31] there's just all kinds of them here in
[2:33:33] this whole congregation. just all kinds
[2:33:35] of them. And I say to you in the name of
[2:33:37] Jesus Christ, stay the course.
[2:33:41] Stay the course. Don't let anything
[2:33:43] change you. Can you say amen?
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Rod. Do we have
[2:33:50] the words to that?
[2:33:56] Sorry, I went half an hour over. [music]
[2:34:04] There's a land beyond the river that
[2:34:08] they call the sweet forever.
[2:34:12] And we only reach that shore by faith's
[2:34:17] decree. [music]
[2:34:21] One by one will gain the portals there
[2:34:25] to dwell with thee immortals
[2:34:30] when they ring the golden bells for you
[2:34:35] and me. Sing it sweetly.
[2:34:38] Don't you hear the bells [singing]
[2:34:42] now ringing?
[2:34:44] Don't you hear the angels singing
[2:34:50] to the glory hallelu
[2:34:54] Jubilee
[2:34:55] [singing]
[2:34:58] in that far sweet forever
[2:35:03] just beyond the shining river when they
[2:35:08] ring the golden bells for you and me.
[2:35:14] [music]
[2:35:16] We shall know no sin nor sorrow in that
[2:35:22] haven of tomorrow
[2:35:25] when our part shall sail beyond the
[2:35:29] silver sea. [music]
[2:35:33] We shall only know the blessing of our
[2:35:39] father's sweet caressing when they ring
[2:35:44] the golden bells for you and me. [music]
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
[2:35:55] Don't you hear the [singing] angels
[2:35:58] singing? [music]
[2:36:00] is the glory. Hallelujah.
[2:36:04] Jupy
[2:36:05] [music and singing]
[2:36:08] in that far off sweet forever. [music]
[2:36:12] Just beyond the shining river when they
[2:36:17] ring the golden [music]
[2:36:19] bells for you and me.
[2:36:24] [music]
[2:36:25] When our days shall know their number.
[2:36:29] When death we [music] sweetly slumber,
[2:36:33] when the king commands the spirit to be
[2:36:38] [music] free,
[2:36:41] never more with anguish lab. When shall
[2:36:46] we [music]
[2:36:50] ring the golden bells for you and me?
[2:36:55] [music]
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we?
[2:36:58] Don't you hear the bell now ringing?
[2:37:02] Don't you hear the angels singing?
[2:37:06] [music] Give the glory hallelujah
[2:37:10] to believe [singing]
[2:37:12] [music]
[2:37:14] in that far sweet forever just beyond
[2:37:20] the shining river. and ring those
[2:37:25] [singing] bells for you and me. The
[2:37:28] chorus once again, please. [music]
[2:37:30] Oh, don't you hear the bells now
[2:37:33] ringing? Don't you hear the angels
[2:37:37] [music] sing to the glory [singing]
[2:37:41] hallelujah to the [music]
[2:37:46] glory in that star of sweet forever
[2:37:51] just beyond the shining river when they
[2:37:56] bring the gold
[2:37:58] for you and me.
[2:38:01] [music]
[2:38:02] I wonder how many here want to be
[2:38:03] included in the prayer and say, "Brother
[2:38:06] Ed, I want to be I want to stay the
[2:38:09] course.
[2:38:11] I want to remain steadfast. I want to be
[2:38:13] an influence."
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, heavenly father,
[2:38:19] as we've lingered on a time this
[2:38:21] morning, but sensing your sweet presence
[2:38:24] and your spirit, and I know, oh God,
[2:38:27] that you're laying down and building,
[2:38:30] Father, I'm just seeking to edify the
[2:38:33] people and all who are within the sound
[2:38:36] of my voice today. that the Holy Spirit,
[2:38:39] oh God, will be the speaker and that you
[2:38:42] will convey, oh God, deeper than the
[2:38:44] ears, as our brother Lance prayed in the
[2:38:46] study this morning, that it would go
[2:38:48] deeper, oh God, than just the hearing of
[2:38:51] the ears, but down into the regions of
[2:38:54] the soul and the inner man. May the Holy
[2:38:58] Spirit find an entrance and come and
[2:39:01] possess with the baptism of the Holy
[2:39:03] Ghost. I pray, oh God, a great sealing
[2:39:07] work amongst your people. These children
[2:39:10] that you love, they are your children. I
[2:39:13] pray, Father, that you'll make them an
[2:39:15] unmovable force. Make they be the life
[2:39:18] of May the life of the of the vine dwell
[2:39:21] in these branches. I pray, oh God, that
[2:39:24] they will unairringly move forward. And
[2:39:27] until that day, for surely we will
[2:39:30] gather at another time, in another
[2:39:33] meeting place, and there forever,
[2:39:37] forever and ever to be in your presence.
[2:39:41] Oh God, I'm so thankful, Lord, that you
[2:39:44] came down while we could not lift
[2:39:47] ourselves up. You've come down and have
[2:39:49] received us up into yourself. And today,
[2:39:52] we've sat in heavenly places. I'm asking
[2:39:55] a great marvelous time this evening.
[2:39:59] Bless us with the word, Lord. I'm so
[2:40:01] desirous to hear what you have to tell
[2:40:03] us through your servant. Oh God, as
[2:40:05] brother Lance comes to the pulpit, Lord,
[2:40:08] and the and the time to gather the
[2:40:11] Lord's table and the foot washing, may
[2:40:13] it be a blessed royal time for the royal
[2:40:16] seed. And if anyone here, Lord, to this
[2:40:19] morning is despondent or discouraged,
[2:40:22] I stand against
[2:40:24] any spirit that would be contrary to the
[2:40:29] Holy Spirit. FOR YOU HAVE EMPOWERED US
[2:40:31] TO DO SO, and we resist every enemy that
[2:40:35] would try to rob the people of the grace
[2:40:38] and the preciousness of this moment.
[2:40:40] Now, Lord, I pray that you'll go with us
[2:40:44] as we depart this place shortly.
[2:40:48] Go with each one. May this afternoon be
[2:40:50] just a glorious and wonderful sacred
[2:40:53] time. [music] In Jesus Christ's name, I
[2:40:56] bless these people and for your glory.
[2:41:00] Amen. Amen.
[2:41:03] We'll sing as before we go.
[2:41:08] The ship is battered. The sail though
[2:41:10] the sails are torn. The anchor holes.
[2:41:13] [music]
[2:41:13] The anchor holes. How many believe the
[2:41:16] anchor holes?
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:41:23] the sh. [music]
[2:41:28] Oh, [singing]

[2:42:00] [music]
[2:42:01] [singing]
[2:42:03] Oh hallelujah.
[2:42:05] It's like a storm.
[2:42:09] But once again, you made our voices.
[2:42:12] [music]
[2:42:12] We have no
[2:42:16] [singing]
[2:42:21] [music]
[2:42:31] [music]
[2:42:34] sail.
[2:42:37] [music and singing]
[2:42:40] I have
[2:42:44] [music] all my knees
[2:42:48] and my face the [music] raing
[2:42:53] sever
[2:42:57] [music]
[2:43:01] inside
[2:43:03] of the stor. [music]
[2:43:08] Why don't you turn around and shake
[2:43:09] hands with someone else who's got a an
[2:43:11] anchor that is holding? That'll make
[2:43:13] two. [music]
[2:43:14] God bless you. Thanks, brother. I
[2:43:18] appreciate. Thank you, [music] brother.
