[0:00] amen bless our deacons we appreciate
[0:02] them it's not an easy job I wouldn't

[0:08] I'm gonna ask the Senior Choir if you
[0:10] would go ahead and just standing start
[0:11] getting ready at this time they're gonna
[0:12] come and sing for us and then we're
[0:15] gonna sing a song for you that's called
[0:17] Psalm 33 and so I thought it would be
[0:19] beneficial if maybe I read you a portion
[0:22] of Psalm 33 so you can know where the
[0:25] song comes from 34 there we go I had to
[0:31] look myself all right Psalm 34 the first
[0:35] the first nine verses says I will bless
[0:39] the Lord at all times his praise shall
[0:42] continually be in my mouth my soul shall
[0:45] make her boast in the Lord be hump the
[0:46] humble shall hear thereof and be glad
[0:48] old magnify the Lord with me and let us
[0:51] exalt his name together I sought the
[0:54] Lord and he heard me and delivered me
[0:56] from all my fears they looked unto him
[0:59] and were lightened and their faces were
[1:00] not ashamed this poor man cried and the
[1:03] Lord heard him and saved him out of all
[1:06] his troubles hallelujah the angel of the
[1:08] Lord and camp a throne about them that

[11:28] seats for a moment as the choir makes
[11:32] their way
[11:36] well brother Ben you're a real dad with
[11:43] those pictures of those beautiful twins
[11:45] the gifts from God and you know in this
[11:50] age that people don't want children it's
[11:54] a fact and to me they're their gifts of
[11:58] God they make a family they make
[12:01] something that's real and I'm sure it'll
[12:04] be a real dad to them boys I had great
[12:08] time with boys so I'm sure you'll have a
[12:11] wonderful time we're going to be having
[12:13] special meetings coming up this
[12:14] following week and it will be brother
[12:17] Aaron McGarry will be speaking to us
[12:19] Friday night Saturday night and Sunday
[12:22] morning we're doing like a camp like we
[12:24] do at camp
[12:25] there will be no Wednesday service so
[12:27] you put that down everybody's always got
[12:29] a question is there this and that well
[12:31] now you heard it from the pulpit there's
[12:33] no Wednesday but there's Friday Saturday
[12:35] and Sunday
[12:36] on the Saturday there's an activity for
[12:38] the young people and it ends up with a I
[12:41] had a picnic place I believe that
[12:43] they've got chosen out it's up on the
[12:46] bulletin board for you to see
[12:47] everybody's invited and on Sunday if you
[12:52] can remember who or counselors if your
[12:55] counselors would like you to sit with
[12:57] your cabins
[12:57] I know some of us are old and we forget
[13:01] real quickly but we can get you a list
[13:03] and we'd like you to step right up front
[13:06] and sit with your cabins and then
[13:07] parents will be right behind them is
[13:09] that okay
[13:10] and I think we're gonna have a wonderful
[13:12] time in the presence of the Lord
[13:14] well it's Mother's Day and of course the
[13:18] world makes something very special of it
[13:20] and it's the only time I think they buy
[13:23] their mother's flowers and brother Brown
[13:25] makes lose to that fact he says it's the
[13:28] only time they even hear from them save
[13:30] them or you know I guess the flowers or
[13:32] chocolates but Mother's Day is a special
[13:34] day and indeed it with our mothers not
[13:38] one of us would be here
[13:39] that's a fact and we won't get into the
[13:42] biology of that
[13:45] but brother branham he holds the mother
[13:47] high and huh and of course you've heard
[13:50] it often the mother is the fifth gospel
[13:53] and we've got a lot of new mothers since
[13:57] we've had a lot of weddings over the
[13:59] last year or two we've have a lot of new
[14:02] mothers and whether they understand the
[14:05] gifts that God gives them or not we just
[14:09] pray that God will give you wisdom to
[14:11] raise them to nurture them around the
[14:14] gospel sing gospel songs to them read
[14:18] gospel stories and Bible stories and
[14:21] they Center your home around Christ and
[14:24] train a child in the way that she'll go
[14:27] and it shall not depart and you say well
[14:31] brother Tom we've seen them depart but
[14:33] I've also seen them come back so if
[14:36] you've got the negative I'll take the
[14:37] positive thank you very much and
[14:39] scripture is Scripture if you want to
[14:42] believe it I'll take Bibles Bible and if
[14:46] you want to stand on the Bible that's
[14:48] where I want to stand brother Branham
[14:50] said God grant this morning that mothers
[14:54] who have wandered away from God that
[14:57] they will come to you this morning and
[15:00] recognize that the word mother means one
[15:04] who has been gone been been gotten by
[15:07] God we realize how much of a jewel they
[15:12] are and how I know this statement I had
[15:17] boys come in from you know whatever
[15:20] activity it was and they come busting
[15:23] through the door and they come running
[15:25] in and they go mom and I'm standing
[15:29] right there it's not hi dad how you
[15:32] doing your mom I'm sorry I'm with my
[15:36] Swiss cheese come on well IIIi don't get
[15:40] it but then I understand what brother
[15:42] Branham says so see a child listens to
[15:45] its mother some little touch from mother
[15:49] a child will listen to when it's hurt
[15:51] it'll go to mother for consolation
[15:55] before it goes to the Father now I
[15:58] understand
[15:59] because she was first with it you know
[16:02] and there's some gift that God gives a
[16:04] mother to be like that I mean a real
[16:07] mother
[16:08] I believe that mothers are honorable and
[16:11] godly so god bless you mothers on
[16:15] Mother's Day hey man so I think that's
[16:20] it for the announcements if you don't
[16:24] mind standing return to the Word of God
[16:29] since it's Mother's Day and I and I'm
[16:32] assuming that some of the mothers are
[16:34] going out for meals I won't keep you
[16:37] long
[16:37] and I sometimes we see them depart
[16:40] because they've got a appointment at a
[16:42] certain time but we just want to lay
[16:45] we've been speaking on trained trained
[16:50] trained for battle trained for battle
[16:52] and this morning I want to preach on
[16:54] trained and battle ready trained and
[16:57] battle ready and you know it's an
[17:00] amazing fact as we found out last week
[17:03] that there was the only a few weeks and
[17:05] they they take a young man and they put
[17:09] him in the Army for boot camp and boom
[17:11] they put him on the Battlefront in just
[17:13] a few short weeks
[17:14] I think the RCMP trained their men in
[17:17] six months I carry guns and and have
[17:20] responsibilities for the law of the land
[17:23] and we've were were more trained than
[17:27] that we're more trained than that to
[17:31] handle any situation that comes our way
[17:35] and we have to stop being children we
[17:40] have we say we are the bride and bride
[17:43] is a mature person and then if you save
[17:47] old brother Tom I'm the bride of Jesus
[17:49] Christ well then you're putting your
[17:51] place you're putting yourself in a place
[17:53] a position of maturity and I believe
[17:58] that that's where the church has to
[18:00] stand in and sometimes you know around
[18:03] the dinner table we have told our own
[18:06] children to grow up because they whine
[18:09] and complain
[18:11] about so silly little things and you
[18:14] know we can just do that here amongst
[18:17] the church whine and complain when we're
[18:21] actually getting ready for a body change
[18:23] and so it changes life it changes your
[18:28] perspective changes your understanding
[18:31] when you know then that I'm to be bride
[18:34] ready and she made herself ready she
[18:40] made herself ready and what the word the
[18:44] word makes the bride ready so please
[18:48] turn with me as I'm going to just take a
[18:51] little springboard off from last week
[18:54] but I want you to turn to James chapter
[18:58] 1 verse 18
[19:23] buddy they're Hebrews James James
[19:27] chapter 1 verse 18 and and uh most of
[19:33] the the I trust the continuity of the of
[19:37] the thought comes across that brother
[19:40] branham makes that statement I've been
[19:41] preaching it here probably preached in
[19:43] Switzerland that when the bride realized
[19:46] her position and so now we start to
[19:50] understand what or was understanding
[19:54] what our position is in the scripture
[19:57] James 1:18 Bible reads of his own will
[20:02] begat he us with the word of truth that
[20:07] is powerful Scripture and James is
[20:12] writing to the bride this is a love
[20:14] letter to the bride so now let's take a
[20:17] look of it of his own will begat he us
[20:23] with the word of what truth that we
[20:29] should be a kind of firstfruits of the
[20:32] creature second Thessalonians 2 and
[20:35] thirteen III dude I don't mind people
[20:42] writing down scriptures as I've had
[20:44] brothers come to me recently and said
[20:46] you preached that back about five years
[20:48] ago on that scripture well that's a good
[20:51] that's a good correlation but I sure
[20:53] didn't preach the same message I
[20:54] preached five years ago
[20:56] scripture scripture I when I go on
[20:59] holidays I also go to the same spot so
[21:02] there's good things at that same spot so
[21:06] don't mind us repeating ourselves on the
[21:09] scripture so second Thessalonians 2
[21:12] verse 13 but we are bound to give thanks
[21:16] always to God for you rather than
[21:21] beloved of the Lord because God half
[21:23] from the beginning what has he done God
[21:27] hath from the beginning chosen you to
[21:34] salvation
[21:36] sanctification of the Spirit and belief
[21:39] of the truce why the truth you shall
[21:45] know the truth and the truth shall set
[21:48] you free verse 14 where unto he called
[21:53] you by our gospel to the obtaining of
[21:57] the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ let's
[22:03] pray father once again
[22:05] we have read your word and your word is
[22:08] true
[22:09] it's amen to them that believe so lord
[22:13] help our believing this morning to
[22:16] believe all that the scriptures say even
[22:20] of us and Lord that we pray God that you
[22:23] will speak to us so individually that we
[22:27] will not be the same person as we came
[22:30] in these doors we pray in Jesus name
[22:33] Amen amen you may have your seats
[22:36] I appreciate the announcements of the of
[22:44] the Deacons and the Deacons are the
[22:48] policemen of the church so that's what
[22:52] the Prophet taught us people say well I
[22:54] don't wanna listen to a deacon well then
[22:56] you're not in the message so y'all got
[22:59] it right down right down there or we
[23:02] live so you listen and everything will
[23:05] be fine
[23:07] battle ready for the greatest battle for
[23:13] your life battle ready there's a cost
[23:18] that comes with every war there's a cost
[23:22] and we went over some facts and figures
[23:25] last week but we didn't go over these
[23:28] facts and figures we went into the
[23:30] costly war of how it cost for personal
[23:34] welfare of the millions told millions
[23:37] that are destroyed by war and we went in
[23:43] some of those statistics and it's a
[23:44] sobering thing but it's no more less
[23:48] sobering
[23:49] to know that if you highbreed the truth
[23:53] you're dead
[23:54] and that is Satan's chore or that's his
[23:58] job if he can make you believe in
[24:02] untruth he'll canker your soul and take
[24:09] your soul to hell and so we say well 20
[24:13] million lost their lives but the realm
[24:15] said billions have lost their lives
[24:18] because they believed false doctrine so
[24:25] that's why it's important to know that
[24:27] you've been chosen from the beginning in
[24:30] truth do you get that you've been chosen
[24:37] from the beginning in truth truth is
[24:41] very important a cost of a war
[24:48] financially is is mind-boggling and
[24:53] mind-blowing the materials that are
[24:57] needed 338 billion dollars that the
[25:03] United States of America spent on World
[25:05] War one what could that have done for
[25:11] humanity or mankind but Satan isn't
[25:15] interested in that he's only interested
[25:18] in destruction and brother Brad makes
[25:22] his statements Satan feeds on the flesh
[25:24] of his own children so you think that
[25:28] you're in a picnic you're not in a
[25:30] picnic you're in the greatest battle for
[25:33] life costs of world war two it exceeds
[25:40] that goes from 338 billion the cost of
[25:45] world war two in america alone in
[25:47] today's dollars is four point one
[25:50] trillion dollars spent that's a lot of
[25:56] money that's a lot of costs
[26:01] us deployed in World War one 4.7 million
[26:05] men world war ii deployed 12.2 million
[26:09] men how many were lost how many were
[26:13] shot how many were killed but how many
[26:18] were protected by the divine hand of God
[26:22] so that the gene pool of your
[26:27] grandparents and your parents could be
[26:32] alive so that you could hear the gospel
[26:36] and become a son of God to me that's a
[26:40] greater thing that's a greater thing
[26:43] that God can watch over at a multiples
[26:47] militants from the Ukraine to Russia
[26:52] Europe America Canada and to think that
[26:57] he's watched it over it all so that that
[27:01] gene line could come through now brother
[27:06] Bram said this he says the enemy the
[27:14] enemy tries to take your land and
[27:21] sometimes we willingly give it up
[27:23] because we don't want to fight I
[27:29] remember I was going back I probably
[27:31] mentioned that years ago we moved to
[27:34] weird Cloverdale we had a I called the
[27:38] sack lot it was a pie shaped lot and I
[27:40] had a nice gentleman that moved next
[27:42] door to me and he want to put up a hedge
[27:44] and I was studying so I you know I don't
[27:48] I hate landscaping
[27:50] I hate dirt I don't that's what I just
[27:52] like I don't cut lawns
[27:54] I am not that type of guy so I come
[27:58] outside and Rick's got the line and he's
[28:01] doing a plumb line to put the hedge down
[28:05] the edge of the property he says well we
[28:08] can't find the far
[28:09] ten so we will just say it's a boat here
[28:13] and I said oh yeah about there doesn't
[28:16] mine I mean when he what's you know five
[28:19] inches or six inches you know but take
[28:22] 300 feet or something that's you know
[28:24] fair bit and I'm Scottish you know so I
[28:29] I go back to my room I started studying
[28:32] and I ain't on this I'm studying I'm
[28:34] stewing I think how dare him assume my
[28:41] land hey this is serious I paid for it
[28:46] and will pay for it for a long time
[28:49] through a mortgage so I said to myself
[28:52] self get up from your studies and go
[28:56] outside and go find that pin because
[29:00] every plot has a pin where you can
[29:05] measure where your property is there's a
[29:07] legal legal description so we go and
[29:12] sure enough these six inches over on my
[29:14] land and I felt so proud of myself that
[29:18] I actually got back my own land which
[29:22] mine already and you don't sometimes we
[29:26] get so proud of ourselves of taking
[29:28] something back but it was yours already
[29:30] you didn't even have to fight for it's
[29:32] already given yours it's given to you
[29:35] and so now the saints of God we've been
[29:39] given the Word of God and we need to use
[29:42] it for the benefit of the gospel it's
[29:47] our property this is our land that is
[29:51] why we started last week with Jonathan
[29:54] and his armor-bearer
[29:58] Jonathan realized that those rotten
[30:02] Philistines we're on their god-given
[30:07] land
[30:10] everybody understand that you know
[30:14] there's different types of wars war for
[30:17] economy war for just you know plunder
[30:20] there's different wars wars for
[30:21] principle brother Bram talks about but
[30:23] now what was happening the Philistines
[30:25] were on the land that God had given
[30:28] Israel and Jonathan just happened to be
[30:31] that type of person that says you know
[30:33] what devil I'm tired of you on my
[30:36] property and so then he doesn't tell he
[30:40] doesn't make a big hurry of it he
[30:42] doesn't tell his father King Saul of it
[30:44] he just tells his armor-bearer and he
[30:47] says to his armor-bearer he says to the
[30:50] young man that bears his armor come
[30:52] let's see let's go see this garrison of
[30:54] uncircumcised he knew what he was going
[30:58] to face Wes he knew exactly what he was
[31:01] going to face a garrison by himself his
[31:06] armor-bearer wasn't his second man his
[31:09] armor-bearer was only bearing his armor
[31:11] needed for him to fight the fight so
[31:15] that I give credit to the armor bearer
[31:18] because he had to have confident in whom
[31:22] he's carrying armor for but I loved his
[31:28] attitude as we read he said to the armor
[31:30] bearer come and see let's go see this
[31:32] garrison of the uncircumcised it may be
[31:36] that the Lord will work for us for
[31:38] there's no there is no restraint to the
[31:41] Lord to say by many or by few and the
[31:44] armor bearer said unto him do all that's
[31:47] in thine heart turn thee behold I am
[31:51] with thee according to thy heart and I
[31:56] so we preached on it and we made that
[31:59] little subsection one of them I'm one of
[32:04] those type of armor bearer whatever was
[32:07] in Jonathan's or whatever is in Christ
[32:09] part
[32:09] I'm with Christ I'm with the word I
[32:14] don't care what anybody else says we're
[32:17] going to state what the word
[32:19] says and that to me is very important
[32:23] and I and I loved how you have to when
[32:29] you take a position you take a position
[32:32] on the word Jesus took his position that
[32:38] he is going to raise on the third day
[32:41] because he was going back to what the
[32:44] psalmist had written that God would not
[32:47] leave his soul in Hell where the RAM
[32:50] said it was one scripture that raised
[32:53] him from the grave one scripture and
[32:57] jesus knew he was not going to stay in
[33:00] that doom so now what was what was in
[33:05] Jonathan's mind when he was thinking
[33:08] that the Lord can deliver well could he
[33:12] go back to Deuteronomy could he go back
[33:15] to scripture and the scripture reads in
[33:19] Deuteronomy 32 and 31 chase a thousand
[33:24] and to ten thousand I got big eight men
[33:29] on that night of course that's Old
[33:32] Testament right that's Old Testament how
[33:36] should one chase a thousand and to put
[33:40] ten thousand a flight except their rock
[33:42] have sold them and the Lord had shut
[33:45] them up then if the Lord is able to
[33:47] deliver one to a thousand two to ten
[33:50] thousand couldn't he deliver a garrison
[33:52] in to Jonathan's hands so then I could
[33:55] say he's trained and he's battle ready
[33:59] trained and battle ready we ourselves
[34:08] find ourselves continually brother
[34:13] Browne said in a battle continually that
[34:20] doesn't mean they're just in a battle on
[34:21] this Sunday continually in a battle but
[34:26] we've now been given Scripture come on
[34:29] stay with me because I make it
[34:32] nation and then you build on the
[34:33] foundation I wonder I want to take you
[34:36] along with me
[34:37] so if Jonathan could take one scripture
[34:41] teri and go after a garrison climb a
[34:45] mountain a thorny mountain and you know
[34:50] I had to climb a thorny mountain sit
[34:51] this week you know you got to climb some
[34:54] thorny mountains but you know what we're
[34:56] not going to give in we can't give in
[35:00] we're battle trained trained and ready
[35:07] the Bible says to us are you ready are
[35:11] you ready now so Jonathan takes a
[35:14] scripture let's say out of Deuteronomy
[35:15] one could send a thousand to ten
[35:18] thousand so your faith has got to be
[35:21] based on something and our faith is
[35:24] based on shrews you've got that that's
[35:28] what we started the whole scriptures
[35:30] reading today we're born by truth all
[35:34] right so now I'm going to give you
[35:36] troops are you mature enough class now
[35:40] to take truth truth is even the mystery
[35:45] that has been hid from ages and from
[35:50] generations as Colossians one in 26 but
[35:54] is now made manifest to his Saints now
[35:59] in the present Jesus Christ the same
[36:01] yesterday today and forever so he said
[36:04] well Paul wrote it for the Colossians no
[36:06] I want you to say Paul wrote that for me
[36:12] he wrote it for me so now even the
[36:15] mystery which has been hidden from ages
[36:18] and from generation but now is made
[36:21] manifest or is now unveiled itself or
[36:25] has now become made plain to the Saints
[36:30] to whom are you listening who's the to
[36:34] whom exactly - to whom to whom god would
[36:41] make known
[36:42] the riches of the glory of this mystery
[36:48] amongst the Gentiles come on
[36:52] battle ready battle train which is
[36:57] Christ in you the hope of glory it's
[37:05] been hit throughout the ages but we've
[37:08] been going through Christ as the mystery
[37:10] of God revealed this great God has now
[37:17] come down and unveiled himself or
[37:20] manifested himself to you to you you can
[37:26] say it to yourself this God has come
[37:29] down and made himself real to me whom we
[37:32] preach warning every man and teaching
[37:35] every man in all wisdom that we may
[37:38] present every man perfect or mature in
[37:45] Christ Jesus is everybody still with me
[37:51] because I'm not going to I'm not going
[37:54] to keep you long but I'm going to preach
[37:56] the Word of God to you because you need
[37:59] the word
[38:00] I need the word you hear too much junk
[38:06] through the week that Denton's the voice
[38:09] of the Resurrection many voices brother
[38:13] Branham said in this last age and those
[38:16] voices are too dead in the voice of God
[38:18] and so that one Sunday why don't you put

[39:01] died on that rock
[39:03] I died with him at Calvary I rose with
[39:07] him I am crucified with him
[39:10] are you listening Saint Paul is writing
[39:13] I am crucified with Christ nevertheless
[39:16] I live yet not i yet know i hears the
[39:23] mystery now being revealed yet not i but
[39:28] Christ liveth in me and the life which I
[39:35] now live in thought what flesh I live by
[39:40] the faith of the Son of God who what
[39:46] what did he do loves me we could we
[39:50] could just preach on this one Scripture
[39:52] and stay here all morning this is lovely
[39:56] Scripture now I live the life which I
[40:02] now live in the flesh I live by the
[40:04] faith of the Son of God who what loved
[40:07] me and gave himself for me
[40:14] amen BAM says this but the Christ that
[40:20] made you stop you're drinking you're
[40:23] smoking you're lying stealing that saved
[40:28] you from a life of drunkenness from
[40:32] riling from sin and a devil's grave if
[40:36] God can do that for you he can save you
[40:40] from your TV your cancer a man if God
[40:49] could turn a mess like me around and
[40:55] don't you don't have to look too far
[40:57] because you don't have to look about two
[40:58] inches down your nose
[41:01] and look at yourself and say if God
[41:03] could save me and God could deliver me
[41:07] then he could deliver me from anything
[41:12] why because it's God in you the hope of
[41:16] glory I know you're looking for the
[41:21] preacher to do it for you or that maybe
[41:24] the elders did lay their hands on you
[41:26] but now this is a personal revelation of
[41:30] Christ in you the hope of glory I'm not
[41:38] saying any of that is wrong but don't
[41:41] lean on that when you've got enough
[41:44] power in you the Prophet said to careí
[41:46] world and dwell on them and if he
[41:50] wouldn't have made the end of the
[41:51] sentence and said but he's bound by a
[41:54] law because I'll tell you one thing
[41:56] right now I'd be out of here and so
[41:58] would you so then the God that was able
[42:05] to turn you around from stealing and
[42:07] drunkenness and rile rile is living in
[42:10] sin in a devil's grave a God that can do
[42:13] that can deliver you from your TB from
[42:16] your cancer he can deliver you because
[42:21] he boasts like Goliath he boasts like a
[42:26] Goliath and here's your counsel don't
[42:30] take his boasts David never he was
[42:35] battle trained God had a way of training
[42:39] him already in the desert he had a lion
[42:43] ready for him out there he said for the
[42:45] time I'm not through so many trials and

[47:03] teachers now of the message and brother
[47:07] Bram said he says in in one place he

[47:12] and on their own ability rather than on
[47:17] the leadership of the Holy Spirit it
[47:20] doesn't matter with your teacher
[47:21] preacher pastor brother Brown said away

[1:01:27] I don't care what the doctors tell you
[1:01:31] it's time to push back push back is
[1:01:39] there anything wrong with a milking
[1:01:40] system no they can assist you they can
[1:01:43] help you but don't deny what God
[1:01:46] promised you they might say this is this
[1:01:52] and this is this and this is that so
[1:01:54] this is that no you can come to this and
[1:01:57] this but not that because there that
[1:02:01] might be different than your that I
[1:02:04] don't you followed that but that's that
[1:02:12] brother Bram says this and we've been
[1:02:16] taking it now for five weeks all we are
[1:02:23] today
[1:02:24] is a display of his attributes OBE are
[1:02:31] you getting that Saints that's all we
[1:02:32] are today so an attribute is now in the
[1:02:37] thought of God
[1:02:38] so now all we are this display of his
[1:02:42] attributes first he was not even God we
[1:02:46] would just call him the eternal one he
[1:02:49] wasn't God because the word English word
[1:02:51] God means object object of what object
[1:02:56] of worship and there was nothing to
[1:02:59] worship so then he's the eternal one but
[1:03:04] his brother Bisco started this off long
[1:03:07] time ago maybe six weeks ago the main
[1:03:09] fountain he's the main fountain of all
[1:03:12] intelligence so there is eternal one the
[1:03:18] main fountain of all intelligence
[1:03:22] fountain of all intelligence when there
[1:03:28] was not an atom a molecule or nothing
[1:03:30] light no star no moon no nothing
[1:03:34] God what we know is God the Great Spirit
[1:03:38] that was eternal never did begin never
[1:03:40] did in he was there and in him was
[1:03:45] attributes so in God were attributes so
[1:03:54] you're getting that it was attributes to
[1:03:59] be God than his attributes to be father
[1:04:02] then there was an attribute to be a son
[1:04:05] there was an attribute to be a savior
[1:04:07] attribute to be healed so in that
[1:04:10] fountain were all those attributes so
[1:04:14] guess where you came from that same
[1:04:19] fountain where you can say yes I come
[1:04:25] from God I go back to God we came from
[1:04:29] that same fountain it was attributes you
[1:04:34] see being manifested so we took a
[1:04:40] manifested attribute are those that are
[1:04:44] to become visible a manifested attribute
[1:04:51] of God is an attribute that gets
[1:04:54] manifested so if in that fountain is
[1:05:02] healing where's healing in your
[1:05:03] attribute is in you all the chemicals
[1:05:10] has reported that glass and I put it in
[1:05:12] that little cup this island doesn't have
[1:05:14] the same volume but it's not got all the
[1:05:17] same elements that's in you your
[1:05:22] position now listen he says now you're
[1:05:25] manifested you have become visible are
[1:05:29] you ready for this ready really ready
[1:05:32] I'm watching you in the back now you
[1:05:34] ready for this you've come from the
[1:05:37] unseen to the scene
[1:05:40] you have come from the unseen to the
[1:05:44] seen from the hidden to the known you've
[1:05:51] come from the hidden to the known
[1:05:53] through what through the sacrificial
[1:05:56] death at Calvary his resurrection it
[1:06:00] positionally placed them his Church in
[1:06:04] this realm oh it gets deep doesn't it
[1:06:10] gets deep it gets deeper than just
[1:06:12] reading the title you better read what's
[1:06:15] inside the book that same invisible God
[1:06:20] could come into the individual and make
[1:06:24] the Word of God visible what's he doing
[1:06:30] he's trying to tell you you're the word
[1:06:32] manifested oh my oh my my oh my oh my
[1:06:43] didn't can you can you take this then
[1:06:46] Christ a mystery God reveal his church
[1:06:49] is himself revealed oh I'll let you chew
[1:07:00] on now and that was a good one to chew
[1:07:02] on brother Frank not just a line not
[1:07:08] just a quote but something that's real
[1:07:11] David something that's very real or he
[1:07:16] wouldn't say it his church is himself
[1:07:23] but revealed his church is himself
[1:07:30] revealed amen
[1:07:33] do you see it and expressed by the word
[1:07:38] itself that he is God
[1:07:45] what is he training you for God is
[1:07:51] training you
[1:07:52] for the final showdown to prove to Satan
[1:07:59] you got Eve in the garden but you will
[1:08:03] not get this Eve in Satan's Eden and she
[1:08:08] is not going to fall hey man
[1:08:16] why because that we know our position
[1:08:18] where we came from predestinated by
[1:08:23] truth chosen of God God is training you
[1:08:29] for the last showdown he's training you
[1:08:35] for the great battle if the luck could
[1:08:39] be deceived but she cannot Matthew 24 he
[1:08:45] says right here in a time of trouble
[1:08:48] Daniel 12 more trouble than ever was on
[1:08:52] the face of the earth he's straining you
[1:08:56] to stand on the Word of God and deny
[1:09:00] Satan at every turn and not just in
[1:09:06] church but when you go out these doors
[1:09:09] and you go to your hole and the devil
[1:09:13] gets on your case you take this word and
[1:09:16] you conquer him because if you want to
[1:09:20] write down that scripture to me that
[1:09:22] scripture is so tremendous where the
[1:09:26] Bible talks about that this glorious
[1:09:30] mystery was hid throughout the ages is
