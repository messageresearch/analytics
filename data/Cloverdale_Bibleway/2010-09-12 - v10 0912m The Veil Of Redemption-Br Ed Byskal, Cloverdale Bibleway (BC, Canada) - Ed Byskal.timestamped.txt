[36:25] [Music]
[36:28] of my God.
[36:33] [Music]
[36:36] You are
[36:45] Yeah.
[36:49] Heat.
[36:59] Oh,
[37:17] heat,
[37:22] heat.
[37:25] Yeah.
[37:29] Heat.
[37:34] [Music]
[37:36] [Applause]
[37:41] Once again,
[38:06] Yeah.
[38:09] Heat.
[38:27] Let's stand as we sing once again.
[38:35] [Music]
[38:41] [Music]
[38:43] I can't
[38:46] [Music]
[38:51] [Applause]
[38:56] [Applause]
[39:03] [Music]
[39:06] go.
[39:08] [Music]
[39:13] [Music]
[39:15] Amen. Isn't it wonderful?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; It's a pleasure. It's a privilege for us
[39:22] to be able to open our mouths and to be
[39:25] here with the saints of God and to give
[39:27] him glory. I was praying this morning,
[39:30] Lord, I just ask that you'll be pleased.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Don't be grieved, but be pleased. We
[39:37] don't want to do anything to grieve him,
[39:39] but we want him to be pleased.
[39:42] May he be pleased with our
[39:45] uh attendance here today, with the word
[39:47] that is spoken, with the songs that are
[39:49] sung, and with the worship. And I know
[39:52] that you're doing it from the bottom of
[39:54] your heart.
[39:57] I'll just have you have your seats for a
[39:59] few moments.
[40:01] Uh
[40:04] our brother Daniel
[40:08] was Yes. Right here. Our brother Daniel
[40:10] was in Congo and uh in the future we'll
[40:14] have future days. I don't know just when
[40:17] he's uh getting together with brother
[40:20] Aaron Hardy and they're going to try to
[40:21] put together some of the some of the
[40:24] pictures which have been prepared. Uh
[40:26] but this uh this just took place.
[40:29] Brother Daniel just got back and the
[40:32] convention uh in in Kinshasa with
[40:36] brother Dioa and uh the other brethren
[40:39] was August the 22nd to the 31st. So it
[40:43] just concluded.
[40:45] But I think that
[40:47] it would be good for us to know a little
[40:50] bit about it. These are people you're
[40:52] going to spend eternity with.
[40:55] And I think that we can learn from uh
[40:58] one another. Uh I was I was greatly
[41:01] moved by the uh by a some of the not
[41:05] slides merely but some of the video and
[41:09] uh it's just impossible for us to be
[41:12] there. We just can't do that. I was
[41:15] supposed to be there and I just was not
[41:17] able to go. I felt very very bad about
[41:20] it. uh seven seven days of the 10 days
[41:24] of the convention were concentrated for
[41:27] ministers.
[41:29] Uh they they started out the convention
[41:33] with I won't name the countries because
[41:35] there are many many countries
[41:38] uh from Africa and Europe and even some
[41:41] from United States. Uh there were 2,200
[41:45] guests that started out with 2,200
[41:48] ministers. These are not the
[41:49] congregation. These are ministers that
[41:51] were registered
[41:53] and uh the services went on for the
[41:55] seven days.
[41:57] Uh brother do brother Dioa spoke uh
[42:01] several of those days. Brother Nanda
[42:03] Chedetti from the island of Maitius
[42:06] spoke on Sunday the 29th.
[42:09] Brother Peter from New York,
[42:12] I'm not sure I'm acquainted with the
[42:14] brother, but he spoke on Monday. and
[42:17] brother Caillou covered the subject of
[42:20] the sovereignty of the local church and
[42:23] a local ministry.
[42:25] Uh and uh then they took a portion of
[42:30] the service on the deity of Christ who
[42:33] is the only true God and the baptism in
[42:35] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:37] Brother Kadima from South Africa
[42:41] spoke on the seventh seal showing the
[42:43] deity of Christ in the revelation
[42:45] revelation 10.
[42:48] Uh and then brother Dioa preached on the
[42:52] religion of Nimrod and was that was the
[42:54] first person to be worshiped as God. And
[42:58] it's a it sound like a really a
[43:01] tremendous meeting.
[43:03] uh during the convention, at the end of
[43:06] the convention,
[43:08] there were uh 3,737
[43:12] ministers.
[43:15] Uh it's not good enough for us just to
[43:18] hear about it, but I hope that we're
[43:19] affected by it.
[43:23] And these guests uh were ministers
[43:26] in particular and believers from the
[43:28] four corners of the world.
[43:31] They were fed,
[43:33] lodged,
[43:35] transported by believers of Shakina
[43:38] Tabernacle
[43:39] who barely make $200 a month for their
[43:43] work, their salary.
[43:48] Brother Daniel said, "I saw sisters
[43:50] giving themselves to the work of God.
[43:54] Some of them could come from 6:00 a.m.
[43:56] in the morning till 12 midnight
[44:00] or just to receive just to receive and
[44:03] welcome the guests.
[44:05] Parents gave their home
[44:09] their rooms to have ministers sleep in
[44:12] there.
[44:14] Those who were unable to do so tried to
[44:16] rent a place to host as many ministers
[44:19] as they could support.
[44:22] The few brothers that have cars gave
[44:24] them gave their away their cars for the
[44:27] work. And sometimes they had to drive
[44:30] back and forth
[44:32] driving the ministers back and forth by
[44:34] supporting themselves and the cost of
[44:37] gasoline and other expenses. young
[44:40] children.
[44:42] I hope all you children are listening.
[44:45] They
[44:47] worked overnight through the night to
[44:50] help clean the church and move seats for
[44:54] the next service because we had service
[44:57] in two places, two different locations.
[45:02] and the new the new site where the uh
[45:06] and the old church both were being used
[45:09] for the meetings.
[45:11] There are so many sacrifices from
[45:13] believers in the Congo to have the
[45:16] convention to be done so perfectly.
[45:19] And like I said, brother Daniel
[45:21] speaking, 3,737
[45:25] or more were supported by what we call
[45:28] today the poorest persons in the world.
[45:33] I can only see God in that. And it's not
[45:36] the work of a man.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; This wasn't uh this wasn't a 10 days of
[45:42] socializing.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; This was 10 days of sacrifice.
[45:47] We've got quite a number of Congalles
[45:48] people in this church and some that have
[45:51] come from Seattle today and incidentally
[45:53] we're having communion tonight. Uh this
[45:56] afternoon the service will be 4:00. But
[45:59] I would like to say to you of the
[46:00] Congolese community
[46:03] don't seek to adopt our ways but seek to
[46:07] convert us
[46:11] to your ways.
[46:13] I admire
[46:15] and uh desire more the sacrifice or the
[46:20] life of sacrifice to open a person's
[46:23] home to make a bed available
[46:27] to be hospitable or be addicted to
[46:30] hospit to hospitality as the scripture
[46:33] said of one brother and uh uh and I I
[46:37] made the statement this was not
[46:39] socializing we you know we can invite
[46:42] people and socialize. But that's really
[46:44] not what we're talking about here. We're
[46:46] talking about sacrifice. We're talking
[46:49] about sacrifice to achieve something
[46:51] that God is pleased with. And uh I would
[46:55] say that the curse in this Leodysian age
[46:58] is individualism.
[47:00] We're satisfied to be enclosed and and
[47:04] uh uh I realize we can't change
[47:08] everything here, but we can struggle
[47:10] against it. Amen.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; I have very few amens on that.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; We can struggle against it.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; And I think we need to struggle against
[47:20] it. We need to try to break down those
[47:23] barriers. And I know whenever we get
[47:26] invited or go to someone's place and uh
[47:30] we sit and sang, I know, brother Nathan
[47:34] and Sister Deborah here, we've been to
[47:36] their place two, three times and you
[47:39] know, they pull out the instruments or
[47:41] the guitars or whoever is there and we
[47:43] sing and we worship and and uh yes, we
[47:46] it is socializing to a a
[47:50] to a a degree, but that's not the
[47:53] intent. The intent is to edify one
[47:56] another and benefit one another. And
[47:58] when I get around these people, when I
[47:59] go overseas, excuse me, now you're, you
[48:02] know, I I have been many, many,
[48:06] many, many countries, somewhere between
[48:09] 45 and 50 countries. But one of the
[48:11] things I try to do is be a good
[48:13] listener.
[48:14] And one of the things I I have a habit
[48:16] of doing, I ask people, "How did you
[48:19] come to the message? How did God begin
[48:21] to deal with you?" I'm much more
[48:23] interested in hearing that than I am
[48:25] telling them, you know, what I know or
[48:28] what I've learned or whatever more. And
[48:30] when, you know, when I've heard the
[48:32] testimonies of some of these people that
[48:33] are just so poor and simple believers, I
[48:37] feel about that big when they're
[48:40] speaking. The thing that God has allowed
[48:43] them to experience. And you know, when I
[48:45] walk away, I feel enriched.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; I really feel enriched. I feel built up.
[48:53] And so I I don't want you to consider
[48:55] that um you know a negative here. I mean
[48:58] we we can't change things.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; The economy is what the economy is. But
[49:03] we can war against it.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; We can war against the uh you know the
[49:08] things that take away from what could
[49:12] make our life rich. Amen.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you you just you just
[49:18] put it to the test and you'll find you
[49:21] you can't do it if God doesn't open the
[49:23] door. But when he does and when there's
[49:24] an opportunity, and I believe that at
[49:26] every opportunity, we should try to
[49:30] uh be a blessing to God's people. As
[49:34] much as you've done it unto one of the
[49:36] least of these, my brethren,
[49:39] you have done it unto who?
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Me. speaking of Christ, you've done it
[49:44] unto me.
[49:46] Uh the saints there are building a
[49:51] a a building a building is it's not like
[49:54] building standards over here, but it's a
[49:56] very very uh very very fine
[50:00] uh structure and it has to be safe and
[50:02] all the rest of it. Uh, but they've got
[50:05] about seven
[50:07] I think it say six or seven hectares.
[50:09] That'll be about 14 15 12 14 acres.
[50:15] And uh uh the building that they're
[50:18] putting up hopefully will be will handle
[50:23] about uh 12,000 people.
[50:28] And I can tell you they're going to
[50:30] pretty closely to fill that. If you see
[50:32] the pictures, it really remarkable.
[50:35] Must be touching for you, brother
[50:37] Daniel, to go back and be part of it. So
[50:40] now you Congalles people take it serious
[50:44] and convert us.
[50:48] Bring us to your level of sacrifice and
[50:52] hallelujah. We might start today by me
[50:55] having a long service
[50:59] congal style.
[51:02] Let's remember brother Murphy. Now
[51:06] there's a brother right from our midst
[51:08] that's sacrificing. He just arrived. He
[51:11] arrived in Shenzen and just went
[51:14] immediately after a terrible long trip
[51:16] went immediately into meetings right
[51:19] after the meetings.
[51:21] Uh took a bus trip for eight hours where
[51:25] they were waiting for to go right into
[51:28] services again. And so when you see them
[51:30] come back and they're look we're worn
[51:33] out they it's it's for a good cause for
[51:36] good reason. It is it is in truth. And
[51:39] so that's how the message is going and
[51:42] excuse me in whatever part we're able to
[51:44] play. That's that's why I feel so
[51:46] privileged when we're not able to even
[51:50] begin to convey to you. If we did it
[51:52] would sound like we're just going from
[51:54] one meeting to the other with the
[51:56] report. We haven't heard from brother
[51:57] Victor Adamora who's been in Nigeria and
[52:01] Ghana and that part of Africa. Uh we've
[52:04] scarcely heard we've heard from brother
[52:06] Tom a little bit about Siberia. Brother
[52:08] Milco just came back from uh the saints
[52:11] uh in Israel and Hub Station has gone
[52:14] there. uh brother brother Tim Puit and
[52:17] brother Ron Spencer and maybe another
[52:20] brother are are now having plans to go
[52:24] to uh to Uganda and they've they've
[52:28] called and asked brother Kim Dingwal
[52:31] that he would go and another church in
[52:34] the eastern states is going to bring buy
[52:36] some uh some of the print stations, the
[52:40] hub stations and they're going to ship
[52:43] them and get them over there and they
[52:44] want brother Kim to instruct the people
[52:46] and train young men and then he'll
[52:49] probably maybe go by brother um uh to
[52:53] Kenya and and uh be there with brother
[52:56] Oadia. There's just so much is taking
[52:59] place. I am thankful friends
[53:01] &gt;&gt; that I'm not just sitting in a church
[53:04] enjoying a service. I want to be and I
[53:07] think we all want to be active. You say
[53:09] well how can I? Well, one thing you can
[53:11] do is get on your knees and prevail
[53:13] before God. Strengthen those brothers
[53:16] and bless them. And number two, open
[53:18] doors for me so I can be something more
[53:21] than just a average American or average
[53:24] Canadian. I want to open my heart and
[53:26] open my home and open up my uh
[53:29] pocketbook and whatever I need to do.
[53:32] We're not we're not you know you know us
[53:34] here. We're not pulling on money. But
[53:36] when we have an opportunity to do good
[53:39] to the children of God, let's let's do
[53:42] all that we can for only one life. It
[53:45] will soon be passed and only what's done
[53:48] for Christ will last.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. heard about the service, brother
[53:52] John, on Friday night and uh and how
[53:54] they had things set up and couple
[53:57] hundred people out on Friday, uh
[54:00] combining a prayer meeting and uh
[54:02] brother Kyle spoke about the prayer
[54:04] meeting and how it was kind of merging
[54:06] with the witness and that had taken
[54:09] place at the Lynen booth and uh and the
[54:12] people that were touched and some of our
[54:14] young people here, two or three of them
[54:16] just on their own, went out on the
[54:18] streets and printed several hundred
[54:20] books uh maybe from the hub station, I
[54:23] don't know, and handed and they were all
[54:25] given out. I just say, "Praise God.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Stir it up."
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Let the name of the Lord be glorified.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Let the message give the winds a mighty
[54:39] voice.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[54:43] Hallelujah.
[54:45] All right. Should we pray about anything
[54:47] else? Well, we could pray that the rain
[54:49] stops so that that hole out there
[54:51] doesn't turn into a swimming pool.
[54:54] We don't need one.
[54:56] All right. God bless you. It's lovely to
[54:58] see you and have you here. Let's stand
[55:01] and we're going to read the word.
[55:09] Before we do, we'll have a word of
[55:10] prayer.
[55:12] Heavenly Father, as our spirits are
[55:15] quietened before you, we pray that the
[55:18] Holy Spirit will come and prepare our
[55:23] prepare our hearts, prepare the ground
[55:26] that your seed will fall into good
[55:28] ground and bring forth fruit. Lord, we
[55:31] pray it'll bring forth a hundfold.
[55:34] Lord Jesus, I pray that your name will
[55:38] be glorified. It was the name that was
[55:40] given. It's the name that's above every
[55:43] name. It's the name that we all have
[55:45] received and have been baptized in. We
[55:48] thank you for that glorious name. And we
[55:51] pray, oh God, that you will today move
[55:54] about this entire congregation of people
[55:57] out on the internet. Lord, those that
[56:00] are streaming at this time, their heads
[56:02] are bowed praying with us. Move into
[56:04] those rooms by the Holy Spirit. And may
[56:07] there be an atmosphere created, oh
[56:10] father, that will be a benefit to the
[56:13] bride of Jesus Christ. We need to be
[56:15] strengthened, Lord. Satan is waring
[56:18] against us in every possible way that he
[56:20] can. But I pray that you will give us
[56:23] such a unmovable, unshakable faith, oh
[56:26] God, that nothing can move us, Lord.
[56:29] Pray that you will bless this day and
[56:31] bless the service tonight, Lord, and the
[56:33] communion and the foot washing. bless I
[56:36] pray every activity and those that
[56:39] participate and we're all here to
[56:41] participate now in the name of Jesus
[56:44] Christ we ask that the spirit of
[56:46] revelation will be our portion Lord let
[56:48] us see things that will strengthen us I
[56:52] pray in the name of Jesus and for your
[56:54] glory amen
[56:57] &gt;&gt; amen I'll have you turn in the Bible to
[57:00] John the 3 chapter
[57:02] and we'll read from verse one And then
[57:05] we're going to read from Romans 7 uh
[57:08] three or four verses there.
[57:11] Starting with uh verse one of John 3.
[57:14] There was a man of the Pharisees named
[57:16] Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[57:20] The same came to Jesus by night and said
[57:22] unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art
[57:25] a teacher come from God, for no man can
[57:28] do these miracles that thou doest except
[57:31] God be with him." Jesus answered and
[57:35] said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say
[57:39] unto thee, except a man be born again,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[57:46] Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man
[57:49] be born when he is old? Can he enter the
[57:52] second time into his mother's womb and
[57:55] be born?" And Jesus answered, "Verily,
[57:57] verily, I say unto thee, except a man be
[58:00] born of water and of the spirit, he
[58:02] cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[58:05] That which is born of the flesh is
[58:08] flesh, and that which is born of the
[58:12] spirit is spirit."
[58:14] And then in Romans 7th chapter, we're
[58:18] going to read from verse 18.
[58:22] For I know, Paul speaking here, for I
[58:25] know that in me that is in my flesh
[58:29] dwelleth no good thing. For to will is
[58:32] present with me. In other words, he has
[58:35] a desire. For to will is present with
[58:38] me, but how to perform it or how to do
[58:42] it. That which is good I find not. For
[58:46] the good that I would, I do not. But the
[58:50] evil which I would not that I do. And I
[58:54] think we all could say amen. That that's
[58:56] our experience.
[58:58] Now if I do that I would not it is no
[59:03] more I that do it but sin that dwelleth
[59:06] in me. I find then a law that when I
[59:11] would do good evil is present with me.
[59:15] God bless his word and bless you as you
[59:17] have your seats.
[59:19] Um,
[59:21] I have a Scoffield Bible. In fact is I
[59:24] didn't know until I was with Brother
[59:26] Brandham. He saw my Bible and he said,
[59:29] "Oh, I see you have a Scoffield Bible."
[59:31] He said, "That's exactly the same Bible
[59:34] I carry. It's about that's about the
[59:36] size of it." And um, he said, "I like
[59:40] old Dr. Scoffield's uh, some of his
[59:43] notes." And I know in the message he
[59:45] uses some. Scofll says about the new
[59:48] birth. When Nicodemus was asking about
[59:51] it, he said the necessity of the new
[59:52] birth grows out of the incapacity
[59:56] of the natural man to see or to enter
[1:00:00] into the kingdom of God. However gifted,
[1:00:04] moral or refined, the natural man is
[1:00:08] absolutely blind to spiritual truth and
[1:00:12] impotent to enter into the kingdom. for
[1:00:15] he can neither obey, understand nor
[1:00:18] please God.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; That's the natural man.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; I thought that was good.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; I want to speak on the veil of
[1:00:32] redemption. and I uh we had a service in
[1:00:35] Seattle
[1:00:37] uh a couple weeks ago and we spoke on
[1:00:42] the fullness of redemption, the full
[1:00:44] redemption
[1:00:45] and I wanted to bring it uh uh to you
[1:00:49] this morning but it's uh coming from a
[1:00:52] completely different direction so the
[1:00:53] you from Seattle can can recognize
[1:00:56] perhaps little bits of it segments here
[1:00:58] and there but I want to speak on the
[1:01:01] veil of redemption. ion uh brother
[1:01:04] Brandham mentions uh in the scripture
[1:01:07] the veil of the temple excuse me please
[1:01:11] the veil of the shakina glory he speaks
[1:01:15] of the veil of the blood the veil of God
[1:01:20] the veil of his flesh
[1:01:23] speaking of Jesus Christ the veil of
[1:01:26] human flesh speaking of us the veil of
[1:01:30] sin the veil of sickness
[1:01:33] The veil of sorrow,
[1:01:35] the veil of fear, the veil of unbelief,
[1:01:39] the veil of tradition, the veil of
[1:01:42] death, the veil of the grave, the veil
[1:01:47] of mercy, and the veil of mortal kin.
[1:01:52] All of these veils.
[1:01:54] Now,
[1:01:57] there are,
[1:01:58] and I'll just bring this up on the
[1:02:01] screen for you.
[1:02:05] There are two births,
[1:02:08] one natural
[1:02:10] and one spiritual.
[1:02:13] There are two natures,
[1:02:16] a nature by each of those births.
[1:02:22] There's two books,
[1:02:26] a record of each nature.
[1:02:29] And I might just say that's the book of
[1:02:32] life,
[1:02:34] which is the book of life. And then
[1:02:37] there's the lamb's book of life.
[1:02:42] This is a dying spirit
[1:02:45] in a dying body. But now you can't be
[1:02:49] two bodies in one time. But there can be
[1:02:53] two natures in you at one time.
[1:02:58] Like in the book, Brother Brandham
[1:02:59] speaks of uh
[1:03:02] uh the the book, he speaks of the church
[1:03:05] age book, I believe, at this time. And
[1:03:07] the spot where uh there we was talking
[1:03:12] about the two books being one. The book
[1:03:15] of life, the first book of life coming
[1:03:18] up was when you were born. That was your
[1:03:23] natural birth. But then one time way
[1:03:26] back down in there, there's a little
[1:03:29] grain of life laying there which you'd
[1:03:32] wonder where did it come from? I was
[1:03:36] born of Charlton Ella Brandom. In their
[1:03:38] nature, I was a sinner. I come to the
[1:03:41] world a liar and all the habits of the
[1:03:43] world laid right in me. But down in
[1:03:47] there too was another nature present.
[1:03:51] Predestinated
[1:03:53] was in there by God in this same body.
[1:03:57] Two natures in there.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Thank God for that seed. That
[1:04:00] predestinated seed.
[1:04:04] But really frankly,
[1:04:07] he said, "We have never seen each other.
[1:04:10] We have never seen one another." You
[1:04:13] hear something speaking out of a body
[1:04:16] here that impersonates whatever is on
[1:04:20] the inside. So then when we talk to each
[1:04:23] other, we're really not talking to the
[1:04:26] body. It's the spirit inside, but the
[1:04:29] body is the thing that identifies the
[1:04:32] spirit that's on the that's on the
[1:04:35] inside.
[1:04:37] And then brother Brandham speaks of
[1:04:41] every thought and every act and every
[1:04:43] deed that is recorded.
[1:04:46] And there's a there's a
[1:04:50] a a quote out of God's power to
[1:04:52] transform.
[1:04:55] Is it all right? They just lay this
[1:04:57] foundation.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; We each one come down to the end of the
[1:05:03] road where we're going to give an
[1:05:06] account for every word.
[1:05:09] When we're born, our first little cry
[1:05:12] goes out on a tape.
[1:05:15] It's going to be played back again at
[1:05:17] the day of judgment. Even the clothes
[1:05:19] you wear will be showed in your face at
[1:05:22] the day of judgment. Even science has
[1:05:25] found that by television, television
[1:05:28] doesn't manufacture a picture, it only
[1:05:30] channels it. The color of clothes, every
[1:05:34] time you move, every thought in your
[1:05:37] mind is absolutely kept on God's record.
[1:05:41] And that big thing uh will be laid right
[1:05:44] before you. every one of them filthy
[1:05:48] dresses you wore. Every time you went to
[1:05:51] the barber shop, cut the cut that hair
[1:05:54] that God gave you, it's going to be
[1:05:57] you'll answer for it. Uh you can't make
[1:06:00] a move right there. Just even the
[1:06:04] thoughts of your heart uh while you're
[1:06:07] doing it will be played right before
[1:06:09] you. How are you going to escape?
[1:06:13] How shall we escape if we neglect?
[1:06:16] Notice this now. How shall we escape if
[1:06:18] we neglect so great a salvation? We're
[1:06:22] not going to escape. Every move and the
[1:06:25] thought of the heart is recorded right
[1:06:29] in another dimension. Even the color of
[1:06:32] the clothes you wear.
[1:06:38] Now, brother Brandham talks about when
[1:06:41] you get the book once again,
[1:06:44] you're going to see maybe a little
[1:06:45] confusion there of what I said. Now,
[1:06:48] Brother Brandham is saying here in the
[1:06:49] quote, I just that everyone everything's
[1:06:52] recorded. Now, we're going to brother
[1:06:55] Bram speaking about the book. You're
[1:06:58] going to see maybe a little confusion
[1:07:00] there of what I said the two books of
[1:07:02] life. It's the same book, but one of
[1:07:05] them is your natural birth. The other
[1:07:07] one is your spiritual birth. One leads
[1:07:10] out to the other one just like a stock
[1:07:13] of wheat. Whenever you talk to me, you
[1:07:16] talk to me as a living person. But
[1:07:19] there's a part of me here is that person
[1:07:22] that must perish. That's the that's the
[1:07:25] book that the name comes off of. But the
[1:07:28] eternal one, the predestinated one, the
[1:07:30] elected one, the name never can come
[1:07:33] from uh never can come from there
[1:07:36] because it was always on it. It can
[1:07:38] never be taken off.
[1:07:43] Continuing in the invisible union. Now
[1:07:45] your old book is gone with your old
[1:07:47] union. And now your name in your old in
[1:07:50] your has been transferred. Now you say,
[1:07:54] "Do you mean to tell me that the old
[1:07:56] book God put it in the sea of his
[1:07:58] forgetfulness?" You stand perfectly
[1:08:01] before God. Now your name is now in the
[1:08:04] new book, not in the book of life, but
[1:08:07] in the lamb's book of life. What the
[1:08:09] lamb redeemed, not the old book of your
[1:08:12] your natural union, but your new bride.
[1:08:16] Hallelujah. Your new life is in the
[1:08:19] lamb's book of life. Your marriage
[1:08:22] certificate. Hallelujah. Where your true
[1:08:26] eternal germ from the beginning takes
[1:08:29] hold, I believe is what it says. Amen.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we just have the lights.
[1:08:35] That's
[1:08:37] all we're going to have of that for now.
[1:08:41] Apostle Paul said, and I need to lay all
[1:08:44] of this broad
[1:08:46] uh base out, and you listen very close.
[1:08:50] Apostle Paul said,"For
[1:08:52] I know that in me which I read, in me
[1:08:55] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[1:08:58] thing. For to will is present with me,
[1:09:01] but how to perform that which is good, I
[1:09:04] find not." So he speaks of the of the
[1:09:08] natural flesh and the waring one with
[1:09:11] the other. And I want to say that
[1:09:14] there's a I want to present it this way
[1:09:16] that there's a veil
[1:09:19] uh uh between this flesh. In other
[1:09:22] words, here we are as individuals and we
[1:09:27] don't know one another. We don't really
[1:09:30] see one another. We uh in fact is before
[1:09:35] I'm done this service, you're going to
[1:09:37] be glad that you have this veil of flesh
[1:09:41] because you wouldn't want your neighbor
[1:09:44] or anyone in this church or anyone that
[1:09:48] you are seated with. We would not want
[1:09:51] what the prophet of God said, every cry,
[1:09:55] every word, every thought. Who wants
[1:09:59] that spread on a screen? Right.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; And if I had your book or you had my
[1:10:06] book or anybody had your book of life
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; that and the way God records it, you
[1:10:14] would say have mercy.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, have mercy. Don't make
[1:10:21] that public. Don't uh you know don't uh
[1:10:25] uh surv allow me to survive this moment.
[1:10:31] Who wants their natural life? Now
[1:10:34] friends, this is not poetic language.
[1:10:37] This is exactly the Bible.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Your deeds, your thoughts, every
[1:10:41] movement, every action, every thought.
[1:10:44] And that's why the apostle Paul in this
[1:10:47] flesh there is no good thing.
[1:10:51] There isn't anyone who can boast of what
[1:10:54] they've done in the flesh. Anything that
[1:10:56] you've done in the flesh that is of any
[1:10:59] consequence, you can only thank God for
[1:11:02] it.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Because even when we would do good, the
[1:11:05] will, we have a will to do good, but we
[1:11:08] can't find how to do it.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; We can't find how to perform it unless
[1:11:13] there's another power, another life that
[1:11:15] that allows us or gives us an
[1:11:18] opportunity. So in this flesh dwells no
[1:11:21] good thing. And there's the the this
[1:11:24] flesh is a veil. The prophet says it's a
[1:11:27] veil. This and you we're we're thankful
[1:11:30] in this natural life that there is this
[1:11:32] natural veil of this flesh. Quite
[1:11:35] frankly, I don't want anybody to even
[1:11:38] have any any access to my thoughts or
[1:11:43] your thoughts. We just don't want them
[1:11:45] to have access to it. And and
[1:11:49] We were born in sin and shapen in
[1:11:53] iniquities and come into the world
[1:11:56] speaking lies. friends,
[1:12:00] in order to see the greatness and of
[1:12:02] Calvary, in order to see the marvelous
[1:12:06] things that God has done for us, and I
[1:12:08] will become very specific in it in a few
[1:12:11] moments, but I find that the reason why
[1:12:13] a lot of people can't rejoice in the
[1:12:16] deliverance because they haven't really
[1:12:18] seen how profoundly bound they were.
[1:12:22] Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Evil and sin is very sinful.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; And there's no such a thing as a white
[1:12:29] lie or or just some little thing or
[1:12:31] that's some little infraction. It's it's
[1:12:34] it's evil.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; And we need to recognize it as evil.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; There's no kind of half good people.
[1:12:42] Without God, we are disgraceful sinners.
[1:12:46] And we need to see the darkness of we
[1:12:49] need to see the bondage of it in order
[1:12:52] to rejoice in the liberty that is in
[1:12:55] Christ.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; And so when I come down and I'm spending
[1:13:01] some time on it. Uh I don't want you to
[1:13:04] get quiet. You rejoice that you can see
[1:13:07] because there's a lot of people and and
[1:13:10] in fact is most of the population don't
[1:13:12] really think what they do is wrong.
[1:13:15] That's true.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; And they they they can do very very
[1:13:18] wrong things, very evil things. But
[1:13:20] somehow in this generation, it can be
[1:13:23] excused. It can there can be a a a way
[1:13:26] found out uh you know to make it look
[1:13:29] not as bad as it really is.
[1:13:33] And I have put it this way. God has the
[1:13:36] supernatural technology
[1:13:38] to capture and preserve our words, our
[1:13:43] thoughts and deeds in a book called the
[1:13:46] book of life.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Hey, man with this puny insignificance
[1:13:52] makes computers that you can't even get
[1:13:54] rid of the things anymore. You can't get
[1:13:56] rid of they say, "Oh, it's up there in
[1:13:58] cyberspace somewhere." Well, I'll tell
[1:14:00] you something else. God's word of all of
[1:14:03] his prophets, of all of his holy men, of
[1:14:06] all of his and and the words of Jesus
[1:14:08] Christ and my words and the words of
[1:14:10] William Brandham and the words of every
[1:14:12] prophet is in cyberspace also. God
[1:14:15] didn't need a computer to put it up
[1:14:17] there. He has a dimension there and it
[1:14:20] is held there. It will be judging this
[1:14:22] more sinful world. The truth will be
[1:14:25] coming against falsehood and the lies
[1:14:29] and all of these uh injustices and
[1:14:31] things that have happened. God has his
[1:14:34] own technology.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; And he had that technology before. Man,
[1:14:39] we wouldn't even be able to discover
[1:14:41] this technology if God hadn't made a a a
[1:14:44] place for it,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; made a made it possible.
[1:14:51] There's not a person that could survive
[1:14:54] having the book of life of their life
[1:14:57] exposed. Not a single person. There's
[1:15:00] none righteous, know not one. There's
[1:15:02] none good, no not one. And on the one
[1:15:05] hand, we're thankful for that veil of
[1:15:08] flesh. And if you have risen above being
[1:15:12] thankful for the veil of flesh, I'll
[1:15:13] tell you by the time we're done, I hope
[1:15:16] that you will see that in our flesh,
[1:15:19] that is in our flesh dwelleth no good
[1:15:23] thing. And that is why brother Vander
[1:15:25] would even say the greatest problem and
[1:15:28] the greatest enemy that we have is our
[1:15:30] own self. Amen.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; On the one hand, we find this weakness
[1:15:36] of the flesh
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; and the flesh is weak. You can't make it
[1:15:41] strong. Jesus said it is weak.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; The flesh is weak.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; But there is a, you know, I don't want
[1:15:49] to just leave you there, but the flesh
[1:15:51] in itself is weak.
[1:16:01] Now
[1:16:05] there is one a veil
[1:16:08] is something that conceals.
[1:16:11] So we say the veil of flesh.
[1:16:14] Well, it conceals a whole lot. But there
[1:16:17] is one who
[1:16:19] sees through that veil
[1:16:23] and it is God. The scripture says,
[1:16:26] "Neither is there any creature
[1:16:31] that is not manifest in his sight,
[1:16:35] but all things, all things, say with me,
[1:16:40] all things are naked and open unto the
[1:16:44] eyes of him with whom we have to do."
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And in that I want to rejoice also.
[1:16:50] That's his plan. That's his program. He
[1:16:53] allowed us to have. So we live in this
[1:16:56] world and we've got this veil of flesh
[1:16:59] uh and and it can't be penetrated. I
[1:17:02] mean there are things if you wish to
[1:17:05] expose to your friend fine but there are
[1:17:08] things that you people will never know
[1:17:10] know about you. Nobody will know about
[1:17:12] you. No believer will know. No
[1:17:14] unbeliever will know. No business
[1:17:15] associate. No friend. Nobody will know.
[1:17:18] That's your own. You've got that veil in
[1:17:20] your own flesh. And God allowed that.
[1:17:24] But at the same time, he's tried to tell
[1:17:26] this world that he can see through that
[1:17:29] veil. And he knows all things. There's
[1:17:33] no attitude. There's no feeling. There's
[1:17:36] no anything that can be hidden from God.
[1:17:40] And we want to say, "Praise God for
[1:17:42] that.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; I'm finally found out.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; I'm totally exposed." And the sooner a
[1:17:49] person finds that out, the better off
[1:17:52] you are.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; There is somebody who sees the allseeing
[1:17:56] eye of almighty God.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful we have
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; an allseeing eye.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Who can see us as we are.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:07] And so the scripture says Paul in
[1:18:10] Corinthians, for he hath made him,
[1:18:14] that was Jesus Christ, he hath made him
[1:18:18] to be sin for us who knew no sin, that
[1:18:24] we might be made the righteousness of
[1:18:26] God in him. Amen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Now, these things, friends, are
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to
[1:18:35] take my time and penetrate on them
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; because these are things that we know,
[1:18:40] we hear, but I want to bring it down
[1:18:43] into a practical term so that if we
[1:18:47] really believe it, then there will be a
[1:18:51] an incredible rejoicing in our heart.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Because of it. Amen.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; So he he who knew no sin. Now here was
[1:19:04] here was a God in flesh.
[1:19:10] A life that also had a veil of flesh.
[1:19:15] And when God looked through that veil,
[1:19:18] there was no sin. Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And he lived a sinless life.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; The only human frame that walked on
[1:19:31] earth sinless.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; And God looked upon him and said, "This
[1:19:40] is my son. This who this is who came out
[1:19:43] of the bosom, my bosom.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; This is my This is my prodigy. This is
[1:19:49] actually my seed
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God dwelt in him. The
[1:19:56] fullness of God dwelt in him and there
[1:19:59] was no sin.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; He had a veil of flesh
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; but there was no sin. But when he
[1:20:08] finally that body finally took its final
[1:20:11] steps and came to a place called Calvary
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; and was nailed to a cross
[1:20:19] and was made sin
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; for us.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Then God could not look on him any
[1:20:26] longer
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; and God turned his face from him and he
[1:20:30] cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou
[1:20:34] forsaken me?" That was you there,
[1:20:37] friends.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; That was me hanging there.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; That was my sin. That was everything
[1:20:44] that was in that book
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; that were we would be horribly ashamed
[1:20:48] of this morning. That content of that
[1:20:51] book hung on that cross.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; And God could not look on him. Although
[1:21:01] he looked on him one time said, "This is
[1:21:03] my son.
[1:21:06] in whom I'm well pleased.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, in whom I'm
[1:21:10] pleased to dwell. And now the same son
[1:21:15] hangs on the cross. And the veil of his
[1:21:18] flesh is tore open.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And God can see him as he is. And he has
[1:21:27] taken not only our sin, but the Bible
[1:21:30] says the sin of the whole world.
[1:21:35] He became sin.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Those words are so powerful. I doubt if
[1:21:40] we can really grasp it. But he became
[1:21:43] sin.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Who knew no sin
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; that we who were sinners
[1:21:50] could be righteous,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; take his righteousness.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; So that God then in the second stage
[1:21:58] could look on us
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; and say, "I see no sin.
[1:22:05] It was a complete transfer.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; It was a complete transfer.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; I'm declaring here today, all of your
[1:22:15] sin was nailed to the tree.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; All of your sin, every thought,
[1:22:22] everything that was recorded in God's
[1:22:24] book was erased by his blood.
[1:22:31] There's no man that can stand before
[1:22:33] that cross and and declare any
[1:22:36] righteousness.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; And now the veil of the temple was tore
[1:22:46] from top to bottom.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; And the mercy seat was exposed.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Was just completely tore from top to
[1:22:54] bottom. Why? because the the veil of his
[1:22:58] flesh was being tore.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; He was tore wide open.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; He was totally exposed.
[1:23:06] He was bruised and wounded more than
[1:23:08] that of any man. His visage was marred
[1:23:11] more than that of any man. And the the
[1:23:14] veil of his flesh was tore. And while
[1:23:17] that was happening, the veil of the
[1:23:19] temple was tore also because when it was
[1:23:22] tore, the mercy seat was completely
[1:23:25] exposed within him. God was in Christ.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Reconciling the world to himself.
[1:23:34] Reconciliation was exposed. When his
[1:23:38] flesh was exposed,
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; God looked upon when it was tore. The
[1:23:45] flesh, the body of Jesus Christ was
[1:23:48] tore, God saw his own attributes.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; The sins of the whole world.
[1:24:02] As long as a person is living here on
[1:24:04] earth.
[1:24:05] As long as a person is living here on
[1:24:08] earth. Listen to anyone who's here that
[1:24:12] may not be fully surrendered.
[1:24:17] I'm talking about fully surrendered.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Except a man be born again.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about being born again.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; He cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
[1:24:31] Now the prophet explains it and I'm so
[1:24:33] glad for the mysteries. There's a
[1:24:35] mystery of redemption as brother Tom
[1:24:37] mentioned it here in the last service. I
[1:24:39] thought he was going to get off on my
[1:24:41] this Sunday morning service.
[1:24:44] He said
[1:24:46] now we have contact. I want you to
[1:24:49] listen very very close now
[1:24:52] and don't think that I'm exaggerating
[1:24:54] something. I'm only projecting it from
[1:24:56] what the prophet of God has said. So we
[1:24:59] understand something of the age that
[1:25:01] we're in.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; He said now we have contact through
[1:25:04] science through science the fourth
[1:25:08] dimension as it was because coming right
[1:25:12] through this building now comes
[1:25:14] pictures. So there's pictures going
[1:25:17] through this building voices of radio
[1:25:24] pictures. I'm glad that there's a veil
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; between I and those pictures.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; I'm glad there's a veil between I and
[1:25:34] those voices.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; How terrible it would be for us to come
[1:25:38] and try and have a sacred service and
[1:25:41] have those voices that you would hear on
[1:25:44] radio or television or those pictures of
[1:25:47] those strip teasers, those goddesses of
[1:25:50] Hollywood coming through this building.
[1:25:52] But God has something to erase it.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; God has a way to eliminate it.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; And God is going to destroy it even with
[1:26:02] a fire in the heavens.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Because there's demon forces in the
[1:26:08] heavens.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; And Satan is the prince of the power of
[1:26:11] the air. And God's going to destroy
[1:26:14] what's in the air.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; There's voices going through this
[1:26:18] building.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is pictures going through
[1:26:22] this building
[1:26:24] and our senses does not contact it.
[1:26:28] You're sitting here in your five senses
[1:26:30] and it does not contacted
[1:26:33] but yet they have a tube or a crystal
[1:26:36] that picks up those ether waves and
[1:26:38] manifests them. So
[1:26:42] you see
[1:26:44] right in this building now
[1:26:47] is live actions.
[1:26:49] Not talking about some, you know,
[1:26:51] pictures from a book.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Right in this building now is live
[1:26:56] actions of people.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; In the air,
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; live voices.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; They're here.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; We know it. They're absolutely the truth
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; and the only thing you can do to catch
[1:27:12] it. I said I don't understand the
[1:27:14] mechanics of those things that science
[1:27:17] has invented but we know that it proves
[1:27:20] to us there is a fourth dimension.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Now in the fifth dimension
[1:27:27] is where the sinner the the unbeliever
[1:27:31] dies and goes.
[1:27:33] The fifth dimension is a kind of well a
[1:27:37] horrible dimension.
[1:27:40] It's like a nightmare. He said he's
[1:27:42] locked in it because he cannot go into
[1:27:46] the presence of God because he has no
[1:27:49] blood.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; That's the difference between the
[1:27:52] unbeliever and there may be some sitting
[1:27:55] here. If you have not had the new birth,
[1:27:58] you do not have the blood. Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; You do not have that which came when the
[1:28:04] veil was tore.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; When the veil was tore, the blood went
[1:28:08] to the earth and the spirit went to God
[1:28:11] and the body went to the tomb.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; But he has no blood to go into the
[1:28:17] presence of God. And God cannot look on
[1:28:20] him without that veil of blood. Right?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; And he cannot go back to earth because
[1:28:28] his time has been lived up.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; He cannot return. There's no more time
[1:28:34] for him to live on earth. And he's
[1:28:37] caught, as the prophet says, in a
[1:28:39] nightmare.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; As you and I sit here today, there's
[1:28:45] untold
[1:28:46] millions of people in that place. Their
[1:28:51] lying prophet spoke over their casket
[1:28:55] that they were going to heaven. They're
[1:28:57] going to a wonderful place. Don't you
[1:28:59] believe it?
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Without God, they went to hell.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Without God, without the new birth,
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; they will be caught and are caught. And
[1:29:09] even those who've come and proclaimed
[1:29:11] the message and have played with it and
[1:29:14] have just identified with it but have
[1:29:16] not received the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:20] Ghost in the new birth. They are
[1:29:22] destined for that place. You might say,
[1:29:24] "Well, I'm predestinated." I will say,
[1:29:26] "Well, prove it." Then
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; prove you're predestinated by yielding
[1:29:32] to the voice of God and that seed. If I
[1:29:36] was not right with God, I would be at
[1:29:38] this altar
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; before I'm done preaching. I'd be down
[1:29:42] at this altar. I'd be on my knees. I'd
[1:29:45] be calling on God. Have mercy on me.
[1:29:48] I've heard so much and I've not
[1:29:50] surrendered to you. You sent such a
[1:29:53] voice. You sent such a vindication and I
[1:29:56] have just mouthed it. I have just played
[1:29:58] with it. I have not made a full I've not
[1:30:01] made a full decision. And you have that
[1:30:03] power of decision. Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And God, if you're truthful in your
[1:30:07] heart, he will honor that.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, the fifth dimension is
[1:30:15] where the sinner or unbeliever goes."
[1:30:19] He said, "And when a Christian dies, he
[1:30:21] goes to the sixth dimension."
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; And God is in the seventh dimension.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; We're going to be right next to God.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; When a believer dies, they go right next
[1:30:33] to God.
[1:30:36] And then he said, you see, a Christian
[1:30:38] when he dies, he goes under the altar of
[1:30:40] God, right into the presence of God,
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; and he's at rest.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're destined for rest.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; There's not much rest in this age, but
[1:30:51] we're destined for rest. That's
[1:30:54] according to the promise of God.
[1:30:57] And he says to break it down. When a man
[1:31:00] has a nightmare, he's not altogether
[1:31:01] asleep. And neither is he awake.
[1:31:04] He's between sleep and awake. And that's
[1:31:07] what makes him have a horrible shaking
[1:31:09] and screaming because he's not asleep
[1:31:12] and he's not awake. He's drawing an
[1:31:14] analogy here.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; And you can have that in normal life.
[1:31:19] You have a nightmare and you can't wake
[1:31:21] up and you're not awake and you're not
[1:31:24] asleep but you're in a nightmare and
[1:31:25] it's a horrible place and a prophet of
[1:31:28] God is saying that's where you go. It is
[1:31:31] the same kind of a situation. He says
[1:31:34] and to take that shows that where a man
[1:31:37] goes when he dies unconverted
[1:31:40] he's lived his time up. He's he he's
[1:31:44] dead on the earth and he cannot go into
[1:31:48] the presence of God because he's not fit
[1:31:51] to go there without the blood.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching a Sunday morning
[1:31:57] service. I'm just asking you, are you
[1:31:59] fit
[1:32:01] to die?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Are you fit to leave here?
[1:32:08] Two of these pastors that were on the
[1:32:11] way to the convention in Congo didn't
[1:32:14] make it. One was lost in a boat in water
[1:32:17] and one was killed in a truck accident.
[1:32:20] Well, you say, "Well, my that is." No,
[1:32:22] I'm bringing it home to you. You might
[1:32:23] not get home.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; You don't have any guarantee you're
[1:32:28] going to get home. You don't have any
[1:32:29] guarantee that you're going to see the
[1:32:31] morning and have breakfast in the
[1:32:33] morning. You have no guarantee. Are you
[1:32:35] fit? Are you ready
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; to die?
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Say amen if you are ready.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Give a testimony to Christ.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; And if you have a question, you don't
[1:32:46] want to leave these doors with that
[1:32:48] question still hanging in your mind.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; You might say, "I've never heard you
[1:32:55] preach like this, brother Bisco. This
[1:32:56] might be my last service. I don't know.
[1:32:58] You want to?" I don't know either. I
[1:33:01] don't have any guarantee of this
[1:33:02] afternoon or tonight. I don't have any
[1:33:05] guarantee I'll get home.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Neither do you.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Fact, you come to Cloverdale Bible means
[1:33:13] nothing.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing. This is just a
[1:33:15] building of boards and and concrete and
[1:33:18] whatever more.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; We want to know that we have the life of
[1:33:23] Christ in us. The life that God looked
[1:33:26] at when the veil of flesh was tore open
[1:33:29] and could find no sin.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; The only sin he could see was your sin,
[1:33:35] my sin. But the blood was there to atone
[1:33:38] for it.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; And the prophet calls it the veil of
[1:33:42] blood.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And that's where I get the veil of
[1:33:46] redemption.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I and you and every
[1:33:51] believer is concealed behind the veil of
[1:33:55] redemption.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; And when God looks through the blood,
[1:33:58] look through that veil, he can see no
[1:34:01] sin.
[1:34:02] [Applause]
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; That ought to make any believer want to
[1:34:08] stand and shout.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; We can say, "My sins are gone."
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; You can't see them. God can't see them.
[1:34:18] The devil can't find them.
[1:34:21] [Applause]
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:34:37] our thoughts, our thoughts, whatever you
[1:34:41] think of what I just said is going
[1:34:43] through the building right now.
[1:34:47] Maybe somebody says, "Well, you know
[1:34:48] what? I can't really grasp that. I don't
[1:34:50] believe that."
[1:34:54] That's going through the building. You
[1:34:55] might think it's staying in your mind.
[1:34:56] It's not in your mind. It's already It's
[1:34:58] already escaped.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; It's escaped the veil of your flesh,
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; your thoughts. That's why a man in a
[1:35:10] human body called a prophet of God,
[1:35:14] William Brham.
[1:35:16] stood on the platform and said, "Don't
[1:35:18] think that."
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Where was the thought?
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; The man, the woman, the person thought
[1:35:27] it's just in my mind. That's my own
[1:35:29] private thoughts. No, they're not
[1:35:31] private.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; And that's why he'd cry out, "Don't
[1:35:37] think that."
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; And he'd tell them what they're thinking
[1:35:40] and he'd said, "That's not mind
[1:35:42] readading. Jesus perceived their
[1:35:45] thoughts. Why? They thought they had
[1:35:47] their little private thoughts to
[1:35:49] themselves, thinking he's a deceiver and
[1:35:51] he's that, he's this. And Jesus was able
[1:35:53] to counter them because those thoughts
[1:35:56] were already released from the veil of
[1:35:58] the flesh.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; So he cries out once, "Don't think that.
[1:36:08] It's not fanaticism."
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. cuz he picked up the
[1:36:12] thought. It was already out. It was
[1:36:14] already in the building.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; And God had a vessel that could capture
[1:36:18] it
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; and bring it out of out of the
[1:36:21] dimension. He You talk about cyberspace.
[1:36:24] We're way beyond that.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; And he picks up the thought that's not
[1:36:31] fanaticism. Don't think that.
[1:36:36] He says God will have us to answer at
[1:36:39] the day of judgment where the secrets of
[1:36:42] all hearts are disclosed.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; He says come now come sir.
[1:36:49] A man comes.
[1:36:52] It isn't. No it isn't discernment.
[1:36:55] The man is thinking is discernment.
[1:36:59] He caught the thought. It's not
[1:37:01] discernment.
[1:37:03] Don't think that he's not here.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's discernment. He's not
[1:37:08] here." Don't think that. He said,
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; "It's not discernment.
[1:37:15] Don't think that he's not here. He is.
[1:37:18] He's here and he can do anything he
[1:37:21] wishes.
[1:37:33] It's a lady's trouble.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to tell you and show you
[1:37:41] that
[1:37:44] this God of this message,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; has com has everything exposed before
[1:37:50] him.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're thankful for that
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; because this message also tells me of
[1:37:57] what is erased and what is forgotten and
[1:37:59] what is covered and what is concealed
[1:38:02] under the veil of blood.
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; And if you question the veil of blood,
[1:38:10] then go on in your darkness and live
[1:38:12] with your sin. Amen.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; It's the veil of darkness, the veil of
[1:38:18] the veil of the blood that is I I
[1:38:22] wouldn't be standing here at this pulpit
[1:38:24] if it wasn't for that
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; veil of his blood.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; He said to the lady, "It's a lady's
[1:38:34] trouble. It's also a heart trouble. It's
[1:38:37] left you now, sister.
[1:38:40] He who lets me know."
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:44] that it was there
[1:38:46] lets me know that it's gone.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; He that lets us know we were sinners
[1:38:57] also has let us know it's gone.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; It's gone.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let the devil drag it up to
[1:39:06] you again. It's gone. He who lets us,
[1:39:09] the very God that speaks to the word and
[1:39:11] brings a conviction to your heart is the
[1:39:14] same God who says it is gone.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; What kind what kind of a crime what kind
[1:39:23] of a spiritual crime would it be to take
[1:39:26] God's word and twist it back and say,
[1:39:29] "Well, my mind says, well, it's not
[1:39:31] really gone." Amen.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; You got your debate with God.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Not with man,
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; not with me, not with anybody else. My
[1:39:42] prophet says it is gone.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ says it is
[1:39:49] gone.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, there is a process.
[1:39:55] And if you've not repented, I urge you.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; I call upon you to make a full
[1:40:00] repentance. It's not something that a
[1:40:02] person walks into. It's something that a
[1:40:05] person willfully of their own accord
[1:40:08] they do. They must repent.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about godly sorrow.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about full repentance.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And then accept. Don't stay. I found
[1:40:20] people they repent and they repent and
[1:40:22] they repent. No. Listen. Repent and then
[1:40:25] go on and serve God.
[1:40:28] Repent and rejoice that that the that
[1:40:32] the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed
[1:40:34] you.
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; God help me.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; He who lets me know it was there lets me
[1:40:46] know it's gone.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; So go rejoicing
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; and be happy.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; He says, I'm not reading your mind. No,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; don't think that.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Even the woman who was there for healing
[1:41:01] was thinking that he's reading my mind.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; And he's telling her now, what where did
[1:41:07] that thought go? You think, well, it's
[1:41:09] just in the chemistry of the brain and I
[1:41:11] have certain thoughts, not a chance.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; And the God that's speaking this word
[1:41:19] through me even knows that.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you might be surprised
[1:41:24] what a minister under the anointing of
[1:41:27] the Holy Spirit preaching what he
[1:41:29] catches.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; And he hasn't got time to even play
[1:41:32] games with it.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; He's there to preach the gospel and to
[1:41:36] keep preaching in anticipation that God
[1:41:39] by the Holy Ghost will change your
[1:41:41] thoughts.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; It's the same word that's here today.
[1:41:48] The same word that's being preached.
[1:41:51] It's the same Holy Ghost that was in
[1:41:54] Jesus Christ. The same Holy Ghost that
[1:41:57] was in his prophet and all the prophets.
[1:42:01] [Applause]
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; There is no message that exposes it like
[1:42:05] this message.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that we are before one with
[1:42:09] whom we have to do and all things are
[1:42:12] naked and bare before him.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:22] He said to this woman even actually
[1:42:24] receiving her healing, don't think that
[1:42:28] I'm not reading your mind. And it's not
[1:42:31] mental telepathy.
[1:42:33] It's the power of the resurrection of
[1:42:35] Jesus Christ. I I I want you people to
[1:42:38] come to a reality this morning. I want
[1:42:41] to speak to you directly. Here's people
[1:42:44] just like you, a woman just like any
[1:42:46] woman in this place. And she's seeking
[1:42:48] and desiring and needing something
[1:42:50] physical. And here Satan is putting a
[1:42:52] thought in her mind. She's thinking, not
[1:42:54] realizing that, not realizing that that
[1:42:57] thought has already escaped the veil of
[1:42:59] flesh. And there God has a prophet that
[1:43:02] can capture that and tells her it's not
[1:43:05] mental telepathy.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Satan was trying to rob her of her
[1:43:10] healing.
[1:43:13] This is not mental telepathy and I'm not
[1:43:16] reading your mind.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And then to explain where she was in her
[1:43:21] thought. This is mental telepathy. And
[1:43:23] on and now she has a prophet telling her
[1:43:25] what it was. It is the resurrection of
[1:43:27] Jesus Christ.
[1:43:31] How deceived
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; the deceiver would have an individual to
[1:43:36] be
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; thinking it's mental telepathy when it's
[1:43:40] actually the power of the resurrection
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; that is right there
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; to bring them to a physical healing and
[1:43:46] a spiritual healing
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; I say oh love of God
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; how rich how pure
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; how wonderful oh love of God
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; that you look down upon us weak,
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; humans, worms of the earth,
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; and have patience with us after you so
[1:44:06] clearly expose yourself and tell us of
[1:44:10] your great love and then we go on
[1:44:12] thinking it's some mental thing or or
[1:44:14] some discernment or some mental
[1:44:17] telepathy or something and then he
[1:44:19] appeals to us. Don't think that.
[1:44:23] And I'm speaking this to this
[1:44:25] congregation and all who may be on the
[1:44:28] internet. Don't think those thoughts.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Think on these things.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Think on things that are pure. And
[1:44:36] listen, if you're not born again, you
[1:44:38] don't have the capacity.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; And even as a born again believer, we
[1:44:43] have thoughts that go through our mind
[1:44:45] and words that come out of our mouth. We
[1:44:48] say, "Oh, God, I don't want that to be."
[1:44:51] But you want to thank God. You have a
[1:44:53] greater one in you
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; than him that's in the world. You have a
[1:44:58] greater one in you than him that's
[1:45:00] inspiring that thought. And that is why
[1:45:03] you have also that spirit when it comes.
[1:45:06] You would not.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; You don't want that.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; And that's what God is looking at.
[1:45:15] [Music]
[1:45:22] in the hidden life in Christ.
[1:45:26] He said you're scared. People today is
[1:45:28] afraid.
[1:45:32] What are you afraid of?
[1:45:37] Why even death itself don't scare a
[1:45:39] Christian?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Death, where is thy strength?
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:45] The very thoughts of people
[1:45:48] is scared.
[1:45:50] Oh, brother Brandham, the doctor told me
[1:45:52] I just can't get well.
[1:45:55] What are you scared of?
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is very scientific.
[1:46:02] Comes from the God of science.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; He says there's an atonement. What are
[1:46:08] you scared of?
[1:46:10] There's an atonement
[1:46:12] laying for you
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; yonder.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandham, I've done so
[1:46:18] much sins.
[1:46:20] What are you scared of?
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; There's an atonement.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; And I couldn't I couldn't emphasize
[1:46:27] sufficiently in all of the scriptures. I
[1:46:29] could go through the scriptures and take
[1:46:31] all the negative things of us as humans
[1:46:33] and you would be down on the floor, I
[1:46:36] would think, crawling out of this place
[1:46:38] because of the darkness and the evil and
[1:46:41] how God looks on it. Think of the
[1:46:43] holiness of God
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; and your actions in the last week, your
[1:46:48] thoughts in the last week, your words in
[1:46:50] the last few hours
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; in the presence of a holy God. You
[1:46:56] couldn't even exist in his presence.
[1:47:03] And so when we see that then we have
[1:47:07] such a thanksgiving that there is an
[1:47:09] exit.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; There is a way out.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; So he's asking what are you scared of?
[1:47:18] There's an atonement laying yonder.
[1:47:20] Well, brother Brandham, now he's going
[1:47:22] in into conversation as it were with you
[1:47:26] and I. Well, brother Brandham, I've done
[1:47:28] so much sins. What are you scared of?
[1:47:31] There's an atonement waiting for you.
[1:47:34] There's someone who loves you. Don't be
[1:47:36] scared.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; And now, don't ever forget these words.
[1:47:41] The constant
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; words of Jesus. Fear not.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; I'm he that was dead and is alive again
[1:47:50] and alive forever more.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; He said, get in that atmosphere.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Why? Because those words
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; are going through this building.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Fear not.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; I'm he that was alive.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; All of the words and all the filth and
[1:48:10] all the vulgarity and all the vile
[1:48:13] things that are going through these
[1:48:15] airwaves that are here with us at this
[1:48:18] present time. But amongst those
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; are words that shall never pass away.
[1:48:25] That's why Jesus has said, brethren,
[1:48:27] heaven and earth may pass away and
[1:48:30] heaven and earth will pass away.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in the future home
[1:48:37] that the heavens will be on fire.
[1:48:39] reading it from uh Timoth Peter's gospel
[1:48:43] and he says it's not just a fire but
[1:48:46] it's a holy fire
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; because it burns up everything that's
[1:48:52] held in the atmosphere
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; but there is another atmosphere
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; I've got to convey it to you there's
[1:49:01] another atmosphere and in that
[1:49:04] atmosphere is another voice as Jesus
[1:49:06] said heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:49:08] My words will not pass away.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; When I quote what the prophet of God has
[1:49:14] said under the inspiration of God, those
[1:49:17] words will survive the fire of God.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; The words of Jesus will survive the fire
[1:49:24] of God.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Going through this building
[1:49:32] at this moment,
[1:49:34] I will
[1:49:36] be thou whole.
[1:49:39] Hallelujah.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Neither do I condemn thee.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Going through this building right now.
[1:49:47] And those words will be going through
[1:49:49] the atmosphere when the heavens have
[1:49:51] been burned and on fire with a holy
[1:49:54] fire.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; This business of cyberspace, God's going
[1:49:59] to hit the delete button
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; and he's going to delete all of that
[1:50:03] rubbish.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; He's going to clean up this nation of
[1:50:06] garbage.
[1:50:08] Hallelujah.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; He's going to burn it with a holy fire.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; And everything that you've said of a
[1:50:20] doubting nature, of an evil nature, it's
[1:50:22] already been taken care of by the other
[1:50:25] book called the book of life, the Lamb's
[1:50:28] book of life.
[1:50:32] People
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:34] [Applause]
[1:50:36] have read that scripture, have read the
[1:50:38] scripture for generations
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; where the lamb stood and took the book,
[1:50:46] but it actually happened
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; in this time.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; The lamb
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; and he waited until he had Elijah here
[1:50:54] on earth
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; and to reveal to us and to all who would
[1:50:59] believe. And if you don't wish to
[1:51:01] believe it, keep your sin
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; and walk out of this building condemned.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Not because I said so, because he said
[1:51:12] so.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; If you do not believe, you will remain
[1:51:16] condemned.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; But in the in the sacred mercies of God,
[1:51:24] God sends Elijah here.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. to tell us what is in the contents
[1:51:30] of the book.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm not so much on the contents now.
[1:51:34] I'm in on I'm actually dealing with the
[1:51:37] action.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; The action.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Is when he stood because the prophet in
[1:51:44] the in the bridge,
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; oh friends, help me.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Give me strength
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; as is so urgent upon me. But when the
[1:51:54] prophet who's already spoken the church
[1:51:56] ages, the seven of them, and laid it all
[1:51:59] out
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; in perfect historical order,
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; and he lays out the church ages, then he
[1:52:05] meets the seven angels of God. Don't let
[1:52:08] a thought come into your mind, I don't
[1:52:10] believe that. Because that thought will
[1:52:12] already be released and God will pick it
[1:52:14] up.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; And it'll be released from your
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; veil of flesh. You want to say although
[1:52:25] I may not understand, I believe.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I don't only believe it.
[1:52:32] I rejoice in it.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm rejoicing in his
[1:52:36] deliverance. I'm rejoicing in his
[1:52:39] salvation.
[1:52:41] I will not believe an evil thought. I
[1:52:43] will not hold an evil thought.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm here for a revival, a
[1:52:53] personal revival today. I've been
[1:52:56] laboring under the word of God, and I
[1:52:58] desire a tremendous release. I pray, "Oh
[1:53:02] God,
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; give me the energy
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; and give me the word
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; and may a spirit of revelation
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; grip the people
[1:53:13] [Applause]
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; and and and in the breach." Listen
[1:53:19] close. in the breach in the message the
[1:53:22] breach
[1:53:23] because he's now called out
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; an elect lady out of the church ages and
[1:53:30] now he's going to reveal the husband
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; who the seals was him
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; and she was called out of the church
[1:53:40] ages
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; and he's going to have a marriage
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; but he has to reveal who he is
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; for her to see who he is.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; And so he goes to the Old Testament to
[1:53:54] the book of Ruth
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; and he shows how that the kinsman,
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; one who was close,
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; one who's close,
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; stay with me. I'm not just preaching,
[1:54:05] also teaching,
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; one that was close, a near kinsman.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said, according to the
[1:54:13] book of Ruth, there was a nearer
[1:54:16] kinsman.
[1:54:20] Hallelujah.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; And he said that nearer kinsman was the
[1:54:23] devil
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; because you were born in sin
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; and shapened in iniquity
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; and he had a claim on you. And if you
[1:54:32] have not received Jesus Christ, he still
[1:54:34] has a claim on you.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; And he will put his thoughts in your
[1:54:39] mind and you will think them and have no
[1:54:42] capacity to excommunicate them. But the
[1:54:45] believer
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; has another power,
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; and he can rid himself or their yourself
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; of those unbelieving thoughts.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Because of the other word that's also
[1:55:02] going through this room at this time.
[1:55:05] Think on these things. Whatsoever
[1:55:07] whatsoever is lovely, whatsoever is
[1:55:10] true, whatsoever is honest. Hallelujah.
[1:55:14] Think on these things. Those words are
[1:55:16] going through this building.
[1:55:19] [Music]
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; There's another word.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Do you hear the voice of Apostle Paul?
[1:55:25] If you had the capacity, you could pick
[1:55:27] it up because that voice is going
[1:55:29] through here. We have the mind of
[1:55:33] Christ.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan, we have the mind of
[1:55:40] Christ. We have the mind of Christ. And
[1:55:43] that voice will be going through the
[1:55:45] atmosphere long after other voices have
[1:55:49] all been stilled.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:54] [Music]
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; And there was another nearer kinsman.
[1:56:02] And Boaz, the one who was close, who was
[1:56:05] Christ,
[1:56:07] came and said,
[1:56:11] "Will you will you redeem
[1:56:16] Naomi's estate?"
[1:56:19] Yes.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will redeem it." Do you know
[1:56:23] why? Because she was the Old Testament.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; She was the Old Jewish church. And all
[1:56:29] they had there was the blood of bulls
[1:56:32] and goats and lambs and sheep and that
[1:56:35] could continue on forever.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'll redeem her because we'll just
[1:56:40] do this year after year after year.
[1:56:42] Well, let it be known to you,
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; this kinsman. Let it be known to you. If
[1:56:48] you redeem her, you must also redeem a
[1:56:51] gentile bride,
[1:56:53] a Moabitete, a no good woman
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; coming out of a terrible group of
[1:57:00] people. The Moabites, you've got to
[1:57:02] redeem her says, "I can't do it."
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Boaz had the wealth.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Our Boaz, Jesus Christ, he could pull
[1:57:13] out the blood.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blood that Satan hasn't got.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; The blood that will be the veil of
[1:57:21] redemption.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That can erase every sin,
[1:57:26] every transgression.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I can't do it."
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; And he was correct. He couldn't do it.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Satan was silenced
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; at Calvary.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; He comes about you and every believer
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; as a roaring line.
[1:57:46] And maybe he's roaring even at this
[1:57:48] moment.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; And soon as you go out these doors, out
[1:57:51] of this atmosphere, for sure he'll be
[1:57:54] roaring around
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; trying to get you to doubt what has been
[1:57:57] said. Let me declare to you in the name
[1:58:00] of the Lord to believe this word is your
[1:58:03] only possibility of being delivered.
[1:58:11] And if you forget it, if you disallow
[1:58:14] it, if you disbelieve it, he may never
[1:58:16] call you again.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, you're trying to scare us
[1:58:20] now." Just try it out. Amen.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; If I were sitting in your seat, if
[1:58:24] you're an unbeliever or just a make
[1:58:26] believer or someone just sympathizing
[1:58:29] with the message or just raised about
[1:58:31] and have it in your home, I would I I'd
[1:58:33] shake in my boots
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; after this vindication
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; after this kind of word,
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; after this kind of myster exposing of
[1:58:45] the mysteries of quat
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; and you still doubt,
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:58:52] [Applause]
[1:58:57] You'll be in a very dark place.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; There was a nearer kinsman.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; And when a pro and when brother Brandham
[1:59:08] is speaking about it, listen close now.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; If you may not understand everything,
[1:59:13] but it'll you'll mean a lot more to you
[1:59:15] as a little time goes on. And now
[1:59:17] between it's called the breach. What is
[1:59:19] the breach? It's something in between.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; It's between the church ages. And he
[1:59:24] said to those in the church ages, "Come
[1:59:27] out of her, my people."
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; And be ye separate, sayth who? The Lord.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Not William Brham. Come out of her. And
[1:59:37] there was a group that had come out.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; And now the God himself said, "Go into
[1:59:43] the desert." Many prophets went into the
[1:59:46] desert. Go into the desert. And he met
[1:59:48] him there with seven angels. He said
[1:59:51] they came from eternity in a split.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; You talk about science. You talk about
[1:59:57] astronauts. They know nothing about
[1:59:59] this.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; This is a god of science. Those angels
[2:00:02] came out of eternity in a split
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; and hung in the sky so that man with his
[2:00:08] technology could take the picture and
[2:00:11] call it mysterious cloud. Of course, it
[2:00:13] was mysterious. It held all the
[2:00:15] mysteries. Of
[2:00:19] course, it was mysterious.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said it wasn't for them.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; It's for you.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; It's for you.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; It's for you, my precious friend.
[2:00:32] [Music]
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; To tell you about full redemption.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; And the full redemption was I have
[2:00:39] descended.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; I've come down now.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; I have a validated voice here on earth.
[2:00:45] I have a prophet mouthpiece and I have
[2:00:48] come down to tell you I am I am
[2:00:52] redeeming you.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I thought I was
[2:00:56] redeemed." No, now you're being you have
[2:00:58] been redeemed, but you're being claimed.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; And in the scripture, the Bible says,
[2:01:04] "And the lamb stood
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; changed his posture." changed and you
[2:01:11] lived
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; in the in the hour he changed his
[2:01:14] posture and the Bible says he came and
[2:01:19] he took the bookl
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; your book
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; your thoughts
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; your acts
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; your deeds
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; your neighbor sitting beside you doesn't
[2:01:33] know but he knew
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; and he came and took your Look.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; The prophet said he was John saw him
[2:01:44] coming out of the eternities. He was
[2:01:46] bleeding.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; He'd been in battle,
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; not for himself. In battle for you
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; so that he would be worthy to take the
[2:01:56] book.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; And when it fell into his hands, brother
[2:01:59] Daniel, it became the lamb's book of
[2:02:02] life.
[2:02:06] Hallelujah.
[2:02:08] Hallelujah.
[2:02:10] Hallelujah to the lamb. Glory to the
[2:02:14] lamb of God.
[2:02:16] [Applause]
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; And what was in your book couldn't pass
[2:02:21] to his book
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; because the veil of the blood
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; prevented it.
[2:02:29] [Applause]
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:02] Dead.
[2:03:05] Old Testament,
[2:03:08] the blood of bulls,
[2:03:12] lambs,
[2:03:14] and the commandment of the law
[2:03:17] and prophets and patriarchs and holy men
[2:03:20] of God. But there was no blood.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; To take away their sin.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; This was the record of their life. Amen.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; But it starts here
[2:03:32] with the lamb's book.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; The generation. The first verse is the
[2:03:37] generation
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; The son of David and the son of Abraham.
[2:03:44] Oh, over here. The prophet said Abraham
[2:03:49] lied,
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; but it couldn't go through the veil of
[2:03:53] blood and it was never reported over
[2:03:55] here.
[2:03:57] Jacob was a shyer.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Jacob was a shyer, but it couldn't go
[2:04:02] through the veil and end up over here.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; David committed adultery, but it
[2:04:09] couldn't go through the blood and get
[2:04:10] over here.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:17] the veil of redemption
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; and none of the sins,
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; none of the weaknesses of the Old
[2:04:27] Testament could pass through into the
[2:04:29] New.
[2:04:31] That's a very thin veil, but it's a
[2:04:33] powerful one. It could not come through.
[2:04:37] It could not come through.
[2:04:42] [Music]
[2:04:44] And if you want to keep what's on this
[2:04:46] side, if you want to keep what's in your
[2:04:49] record,
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; you may do so by the simple act of
[2:04:55] disbelief.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to believe it.
[2:05:00] I'm not going to believe it. I'm not
[2:05:01] going to accept it.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Then you keep your sin.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; You keep the awfulness of it.
[2:05:11] and you pay the consequence.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; I've delivered my soul.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; And through this building,
[2:05:22] through this building are words that are
[2:05:25] going through. And those words, Satan
[2:05:29] would condemn you.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Satan would point out every weakness. He
[2:05:33] is a roaring line. and he goes around
[2:05:36] and he's going to try to get you to make
[2:05:39] a wrong confession. Deny him.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:51] Listen to the tape if you wish from
[2:05:53] Dawson Creek and a young man who I met
[2:05:57] and took a picture of
[2:06:00] a soldier boy.
[2:06:07] What's the matter? Soldier boy.
[2:06:10] While the people are singing, I love
[2:06:13] him. I love him. Comes another voice.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's picking up the
[2:06:19] thoughts
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; that were released from the mind of the
[2:06:23] body of flesh
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; of a soldier boy condemned.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; What's the matter, soldier boy?
[2:06:29] That's the devil talking to you.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Here's the whole solution. Deny him.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Deny him and you'll go home and be a
[2:06:40] real gentleman and be a real man. Amen.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Friends, can you grasp the power of the
[2:06:49] grace of God
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; from a homosexual who's trying to commit
[2:06:54] suicide?
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; The prophet is telling him, "Deny him.
[2:06:59] Deny him and you'll go home and be a
[2:07:02] real gentleman and be a real man."
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Duty end of subject. That's all there is
[2:07:09] to it.
[2:07:15] You can't add anything to that.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; And it's on that basis you sit here
[2:07:22] today
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; redeemed.
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:27] [Applause]
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; This is not based on how good anybody
[2:07:32] lived.
[2:07:37] the power and the strength of the blood
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ,
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; the veil
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; of redemption.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; The constant words. Don't ever forget
[2:07:56] this. Don't ever forget the service. The
[2:07:58] constant words. Whatever you think or
[2:08:01] whatever you say when you leave here,
[2:08:03] make sure that you're agreeing with
[2:08:05] Christ and the scriptures and the
[2:08:07] message. Make sure you're agreeing with
[2:08:09] it.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; And I was I don't want to forget
[2:08:20] the lamb stood
[2:08:23] and whether he stepped forward or
[2:08:24] whatever and he took the book.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet is mentions that
[2:08:31] and he goes back in the Old Testament
[2:08:33] says Boaz comes
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Boaz comes to the field and there's a
[2:08:39] Moabitete gentile. He said who is this
[2:08:41] woman and he has a servant singular who
[2:08:44] identifies who she is and introduces her
[2:08:47] to him which is exactly what was
[2:08:49] happening on earth at that moment.
[2:08:52] Amen.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that he first
[2:08:56] addressed the nearer kinsman.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus dealt with Satan.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; He took authority over him. You haven't
[2:09:06] got the wherewithal I do.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; You don't have the price I do.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not a mighty man of
[2:09:13] wealth. You gave it up when you
[2:09:15] disbelieved in heaven.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; And I've overcome you. And you've been
[2:09:19] cast to the earth. and I overcome you
[2:09:22] again.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; I point you to your defeat.
[2:09:27] [Music]
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says in Boaz,
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; doesn't come to the field now because
[2:09:35] she's attracted
[2:09:37] and she comes and lays down at his feet.
[2:09:40] That's right.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And Boaz," now here
[2:09:45] we have an Old Testament, "and he took
[2:09:50] he took Ruth."
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Hang on close. Now,
[2:09:57] he took Ruth, which was the same act
[2:09:59] that Jesus stood and took the book.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; She had a book, too.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that her forefathers
[2:10:08] came about and her nation came about
[2:10:10] through incest?
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; She has a terrible history. Her book of
[2:10:16] life is wretched.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; But now Boaz took her
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; and inserted his seed into her and she
[2:10:27] became a mother of Jesus Christ.
[2:10:33] God sent his prophet not to expand your
[2:10:36] thoughts and to give you more thinking
[2:10:39] power and to give you some more stories
[2:10:41] of the Bible. He didn't come to create
[2:10:43] new message churches. He came to tell
[2:10:47] the people you're my wife
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; and I have taken you
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; to myself.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Not only that, I have sent my seed and
[2:10:58] pregnantated you with my seed. and made
[2:11:02] you my wife.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; You're not merely my bride. You're my
[2:11:06] wife.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; And as Mary was pregnant as a remaining
[2:11:11] a virgin, so was this bride pregnant
[2:11:15] remaining a virgin.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; And your book of life tells you, I've
[2:11:20] been in this church. I've been in that
[2:11:22] church. I believed this. I was an
[2:11:25] atheist. I was an agnostic. I was in
[2:11:27] sin. I wasn't anything. I blasphemed.
[2:11:31] That's what Paul said he did. I I did
[2:11:33] this. I did that. I ran in the streets.
[2:11:36] I I I lived the lowest of life or I
[2:11:38] lived the best and a moral life. You
[2:11:41] still need redemption.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; And this one when he came and told you,
[2:11:48] he didn't care what you did.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't care what Ruth did. He didn't
[2:11:53] care what what any of them did. He
[2:11:56] didn't care what Tamar did. He didn't
[2:11:58] care what what Rahab did. He didn't care
[2:12:00] what Basheba did. He he he came to
[2:12:03] redeem the whole works.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; How? Not by some emotional thing. By
[2:12:09] pregnantating you with his spoken word
[2:12:12] seed.
[2:12:17] [Music]
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you understood what I'm
[2:12:21] saying.
[2:12:28] And so I'm closing.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; You don't believe me?
[2:12:40] Having therefore, brethren and sisters,
[2:12:44] boldness
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; to enter in.
[2:12:49] you couldn't have been able to enter in
[2:12:51] before now
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; but to enter into the holiest
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; by a new and living way which he hath
[2:13:06] consecrated for us
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; through the veil.
[2:13:15] It was concealed. But now we go through
[2:13:19] the veil.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; That is to say, his flesh.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; When his flesh was tore, the price was
[2:13:27] paid,
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; the blood veil,
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, came up between holiest and
[2:13:35] where we live. And now we go into the
[2:13:39] holiest of all.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. through the blood of Jesus Christ,
[2:13:43] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[2:13:46] soul, both sure and steadfast.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; And which enterth into that within the
[2:13:56] veil.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:59] Well friends,
[2:14:06] I
[2:14:08] can't describe to you how thankful I am
[2:14:12] because on I'm very conscious of the two
[2:14:15] books,
[2:14:17] the two natures
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; and the two births.
[2:14:23] And I thank God my mother and father
[2:14:26] brought me into the world.
[2:14:28] But I thank God for that birth so that I
[2:14:32] could stand here and come to know him in
[2:14:34] redemption.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; That I could labor for him and toil for
[2:14:39] him. And I just say to you, especially
[2:14:43] you young men,
[2:14:45] live your life
[2:14:49] for this bride.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Live your life for others.
[2:14:54] to this congregation.
[2:14:58] The only fulfilled life is one when you
[2:15:01] get my age, you can look back and say,
[2:15:04] "I I I did what I could." Like the
[2:15:07] people in Congo, I I I drove people to
[2:15:11] the meeting. I picked them up. I helped
[2:15:14] those that were less fortunate, those
[2:15:17] that were poor, those that come from
[2:15:19] Seattle, those that have driven a long
[2:15:22] distance. I'm not just going to go home
[2:15:24] and enjoy the quietness of my home, but
[2:15:27] I want to fellowship with them. I want
[2:15:29] to open up my heart and open up my home.
[2:15:33] It comes down right down where we live.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; And when you get down the road, if the
[2:15:38] Lord Jesus gives you time,
[2:15:40] you'll look back and you'll say, "I'm so
[2:15:44] happy that my life has become fulfilled
[2:15:48] by serving the bride of Jesus Christ."
[2:15:51] This is we're not back there and the
[2:15:53] ages passed. We're here
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; and we don't know what tomorrow holds.
[2:15:57] We don't know. But let's let's friends,
[2:15:59] let's give ourselves to this message.
[2:16:02] God bless you young people that have
[2:16:03] gone out on the streets and done
[2:16:05] whatever more. You'll never regret it.
[2:16:07] Reformatted the message. I can guarantee
[2:16:09] you somebody today is is is reading some
[2:16:12] of those messages because you put
[2:16:14] formatted it and you got it up there.
[2:16:16] Somebody's read reading Token. They're
[2:16:18] reading Kinsman Redeemer. They're
[2:16:20] reading this for the first time.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise be to God."
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; We have this glorious opportunity.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; To serve him.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get quiet on me now.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. God
[2:16:40] bless you
[2:16:42] participants
[2:16:43] and those that have
[2:16:48] been reached.
[2:16:50] God reached through to you. I trust that
[2:16:52] you'll take these these words and anchor
[2:16:56] them in your heart.
[2:16:59] I wonder if we could sing,
[2:17:02] Brother Ryan, if you can come and help
[2:17:04] me.
[2:17:06] I'd like to just sing. We have an anchor
[2:17:09] that keeps the soul steadfast and sure.
[2:17:14] Isn't this a wonderful message that
[2:17:15] God's given us?
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; You talk about science. We're so far
[2:17:19] beyond science.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; I I read the things that the people do
[2:17:23] and and and the things that that they
[2:17:25] have come up with. And my my no wonder
[2:17:30] people read the prophet's message and
[2:17:32] just get lost in it because it goes so
[2:17:34] far beyond the reach of our mental
[2:17:37] capacity. Let's stand together and I
[2:17:40] want to just have a prayer.
[2:17:44] Father,
[2:17:46] how delighted I am
[2:17:49] that you have given people whose hearts
[2:17:52] are open to your word and whose minds
[2:17:56] are thinking on the good things of God.
[2:18:00] I pray, Father, that you will take every
[2:18:03] doubting spirit and cast it into the pit
[2:18:07] of despair. cast it away from the
[2:18:11] people. Lord, in the name of Jesus
[2:18:14] Christ, I ask, oh God, that you will
[2:18:16] take control of every spirit and bring
[2:18:19] it into captivity to the mind of Christ.
[2:18:23] Father, that you will achieve and
[2:18:24] accomplish in this meeting what you
[2:18:27] would have done. Oh God, oh God, lives
[2:18:32] are in the balances and people are
[2:18:35] weighing things out. Father, don't let
[2:18:39] them choose the wrong direction.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Let them cast themselves completely
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; at your feet calling on you for mercy.
[2:18:46] Lord,
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; may we have a true the signs following
[2:18:50] that you would have that would be a
[2:18:52] pleasure to you in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:18:55] I commit this audience to you. Amen.
[2:18:59] Amen.
[2:19:00] We have an anchor that keeps the soul.
[2:19:03] If you'll say sing it out, please.
[2:19:10] [Music]
[2:19:15] The soul
[2:19:18] steadfast and sure while the pills roll.
[2:19:23] It's fastened to the rock that cannot
[2:19:27] move.
[2:19:29] Grounded firmity in the Savior's love.
[2:19:35] We have an anchor. The king of
[2:19:43] While the
[2:19:45] ro it's fastened to the rock that cannot
[2:19:50] move
[2:19:54] in the Savior.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Let's sing the first verse. Will your
[2:20:00] anchor hold in the storms of life? When
[2:20:05] the clouds unfold, their wings strike.
[2:20:10] When the strong ties lift and the cables
[2:20:15] strain, when your anchor drift over
[2:20:21] singing, we have an anchor that keeps us
[2:20:26] home.
[2:20:28] and passing through
[2:20:33] passing through
[2:20:39] eternity in the Savior.
[2:20:45] When our eyes behold through the
[2:20:49] gathering night the city of gold our har
[2:20:56] we shall anchor fast by the heavenly
[2:21:01] shore. When the storms fall past forever
[2:21:07] more
[2:21:10] and turn
[2:21:12] the soul
[2:21:14] stand and sure while the old road I'm
[2:21:19] fastened to the rock that cannot move
[2:21:27] in the
[2:21:31] saints.
[2:21:32] Friends,
[2:21:33] I am so so so
[2:21:37] grateful, so thankful to God
[2:21:41] for the revelation of this word.
[2:21:46] [Music]
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're not sitting in
[2:21:49] some dead
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; tradition,
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; living off of history?
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; This is now. Yes sir.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Weakness
[2:22:09] I found
[2:22:11] to cover all my sins.
[2:22:16] [Music]
[2:22:17] Oh, it's in Jesus.
[2:22:21] Oh, in Jesus.
[2:22:25] It's in Jesus.
[2:22:28] He's the one.
[2:22:33] He's the rock of salvation
[2:22:37] and he's a firm foundation.
[2:22:41] It's in Jesus.
[2:22:44] He is the one. It's in Jesus.
[2:22:49] Oh, it's in Jesus.
[2:22:54] Oh, in Jesus.
[2:22:57] It's in Jesus
[2:23:00] and he
[2:23:02] the one
[2:23:05] he's the rock of salvation.
[2:23:07] [Music]
[2:23:13] It's in Jesus.
[2:23:16] He is the one.
[2:23:22] Praise the Lord.
[2:23:24] Well, I have only one desire that
[2:23:28] brother Bisco would have just carried on
[2:23:29] a little more. Then we just could have
[2:23:31] gone right into the communion service
[2:23:34] because I don't even know where to pick
[2:23:36] up any pieces.
[2:23:39] Yeah, it's tremendous.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; We might just have to go right to the
[2:23:42] communion table, saints of God, or just
[2:23:44] replay the tape. It was just marvelous.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; 4:00.
[2:23:50] At four o'clock, the service this
[2:23:51] evening will be started and we've got a
[2:23:55] few hours to take a little rest. But
[2:23:58] brother Bram said this is something we
[2:24:00] just don't do as a tradition.
[2:24:02] This is something we take very serious
[2:24:05] and we're thankful that we can come to
[2:24:07] the Lord's supper table this evening and
[2:24:11] that we could tar one for another. I
[2:24:13] believe believe it'll be a special and
[2:24:16] wonderful time for each and every one of
[2:24:18] us. So be praying this afternoon that
[2:24:20] God will just have his divine will and
[2:24:23] way within this service this evening.
[2:24:26] Let's pray.
[2:24:31] Father, we can truly say we've heard
[2:24:33] wonderful
[2:24:34] words of life.
[2:24:37] And Lord, it's thrilled my soul and I am
[2:24:40] so thankful that we have this lovely
[2:24:43] unveiled Christ standing before a
[2:24:46] people. Lord, we're just praying now as
[2:24:49] we'll continue this afternoon and we'll
[2:24:51] have communion. We just pray the same
[2:24:54] presence that is here now will just
[2:24:56] continue with your people that we would
[2:24:59] unite our little licks of fire that you
[2:25:01] would be glorified for the scripture has
[2:25:03] declared, Lord, that if you would be
[2:25:05] lifted up, you'll draw all men to you.
[2:25:08] So, Father, we're just praying you'll be
[2:25:10] with the people this afternoon. Prepare
[2:25:12] us, we pray, and may you be glorified.
[2:25:15] go with us now we ask in Jesus precious
[2:25:19] name. Amen. You're dismissed. God be
[2:25:22] with you. God watch over you and give
[2:25:25] you a blessed afternoon. We'll see you
[2:25:26] Lord willing then at 4:00. God bless.
[2:25:29] Amen.
[2:25:30] [Music]
[2:26:23] Hallelujah.
