[0:01] now there's been a day when that son
[0:04] Rose back there in the beginning a s o n
[0:07] of God came on the earth now he's
[0:11] promised again in the evening time now
[0:14] we've had a dismal date we've had great
[0:16] meetings we've healed the sick we've had
[0:18] great times and we have made
[0:20] organizations and schools and hospitals
[0:22] and seminaries which is all right just a
[0:25] dismal day but he promised just before
[0:28] the Night Comes it shall be light now
[0:32] Jesus said in St Luke the 17th chapter
[0:35] he said as it was in the days of Sodom
[0:39] now listen close I'm closing as it was
[0:42] in the days of Sodom so shall it be at
[0:46] the coming of the son of man we all know
[0:49] that now he read the same Bible in
[0:52] Genesis that we read and what's the
[0:55] setting in
[0:56] Sodom now at Sodom there was three
[0:59] classes of people people there's always
[1:01] three places of people that's Believers
[1:03] make Believers and unbelievers now here
[1:06] was Abraham his name had been changed
[1:09] from Abram to Abraham which meant father
[1:14] of Nations and he couldn't have the baby
[1:17] as long as his name was Abram it had to
[1:20] be changed to
[1:22] Abraham for ham does mean father of
[1:25] Nations now notice father to the
[1:28] Nations I notice the scene has never
[1:33] been said in all the world like it is
[1:35] right
[1:36] now now we see everything exactly in the
[1:39] line of Sodom if you don't believe it
[1:41] take off your Shades from your eyes and
[1:44] walk out look on the street each day
[1:47] look the newspapers wherever you wish to
[1:49] it's a Sodom and
[1:52] Zach and there was lot down in Sodom but
[1:55] here was Abraham was elected the one
[1:58] with the promise he he wasn't in Sodom
[2:01] he didn't go down there he was called
[2:02] out now there's three groups of people
[2:04] there was a genuine believer and there
[2:07] was a the lukewarm which Any teacher
[2:09] will tell you that lot represented the
[2:12] nominal Church which was in Sodom and
[2:14] there was a sodomite man now notice just
[2:18] before the they were Abraham and lot was
[2:22] looking for a promised miraculous son is
[2:27] that right is that what the church is
[2:29] looking for today
[2:30] a return of this son amen Jesus Christ
[2:34] the son of God we're looking for him to
[2:37] come now look at the position everybody
[2:40] will admit she's in a Sodom condition I
[2:42] passed over California here the other
[2:44] day and got a hold of a magazine or
[2:46] paper r or homosexuals had in increased
[2:50] 60% in the last
[2:52] year oh my it's pitiful see it's just
[2:56] because women istill themselves away
[2:59] that's right
[3:01] and it's on the street naked and it's
[3:03] just it's just a
[3:04] shame but the Bible said they'd be that
[3:07] way and even to men it's just they
[3:10] they're changed see it's going to get
[3:13] worse and another another if the world
[3:15] would stand another 50 years the whole
[3:16] world will be totally insane look at the
[3:19] sanity from 40 from 20 years ago to this
[3:22] time now look at the setting here's
[3:25] Abraham the elected called out here now
[3:28] and there's
[3:30] lock down in Sodom and Three Angels came
[3:34] up two angels went down in to talk to
[3:37] lot and they preached the word and tried
[3:40] to get lot out of there is that right
[3:42] but this one has stayed behind with
[3:45] Abraham he didn't try to get Abraham out
[3:47] of anything because he was already out
[3:49] see he was out but watch what kind of a
[3:52] sign he done now look he was sitting
[3:55] with his back turned to the tent and
[3:57] Sarah was in the tent behind
[4:00] he had never seen her yet and remember
[4:02] just a day or two before that his name
[4:04] was Abram and her she was Saria and now
[4:06] she's Sarah a r ah H he's a b r a h a m
[4:11] he said
[4:13] Abraham where is your wife Sarah s a r a
[4:18] h said she's in the tent behind you he
[4:22] said I'm going to visit you according to
[4:24] the time of life I looked for that child
[4:26] for 25 years she's nearly 100 now he is
[4:29] 100 she's 90 said said I'm going to
[4:33] visit you according to the time of life
[4:35] and you're going to have that
[4:36] son and Sarah she kind of laughed you
[4:39] know to herself she said me an old woman
[4:43] see as we're mixed audience but you know
[4:47] what I mean is man and wife family
[4:48] relation had been years and years and
[4:50] years past you see because he was 100
[4:52] and she was 90 well Street said me have
[4:55] pleasure with my Lord Abraham and him
[4:57] being old too see
[5:00] and then this man with his back turned
[5:02] to the tent said why did Abraham why did
[5:05] Sarah laugh in the tent saying these
[5:07] things couldn't be Abraham called him
[5:10] Elohim that was God Elohim is a is a
[5:15] self-existing one see they're all
[5:17] sufficient self-existing in the
[5:19] beginning God take that word God look at
[5:21] it back here same translated the same
[5:23] thing Elohim so there was Elohim
[5:26] manifested in flesh that eat the flesh
[5:29] of a calf drinking the milk from the cow
[5:32] and eat bread and set talking to Abraham
[5:36] and Abraham knew that he could discern
[5:39] what was in Sarah's thoughts back there
[5:40] and that's the reason he know that was
[5:42] Elohim amen Jesus said notice in the
[5:47] days when the son of man shall be
[5:50] revealed being revealed in the last days
[5:53] it'll be like it was in the days of
[5:54] Sodom God manifested in his church the
[5:58] human beings revealing
[6:01] himself see in human flesh like he was
[6:05] then now look I want to ask you
[6:07] something in all of the ages since the
[6:11] church first began they have never had a
[6:14] messenger to him that his name ended
[6:17] with h m to
[6:19] now g r a h a
[6:23] m right down there call him out Oral
[6:26] Roberts biling
[6:27] Graham see h a.m there's been Moody
[6:31] sanky fny Wesley Billy Sundy all them
[6:33] see International Church like that World
[6:36] Church V there never been one ending to
[6:39] hm or right now and that's Billy
[6:43] Graham see that's six letters g r a h a
[6:47] m six meaning the man was born created
[6:51] on the sixth date six is man's number
[6:54] there he is to the church
[6:55] natural Abraham is a b r a h a m
[7:00] seven letters
[7:02] see look at the setting of the day and
[7:05] look what's taking place Abraham had
[7:08] seen many signs and wonders and
[7:10] everything that God had done so has the
[7:12] church you've received the Holy Ghost
[7:14] spoken tongues done all these signs and
[7:16] wonders but your promised as it was then
[7:19] so shall it be
[7:21] again it shall be light in the evening
[7:24] time Jesus Christ the same same son will
[7:28] appear again on the scene any his church
[7:30] and will do the same thing that he did
[7:32] then showing that he is the word made
[7:34] manifest amen see knowing the secret
[7:38] that's in the heart revealing and doing
[7:40] the things that he's supposed to do
[7:42] that's exactly the word of God we're
[7:44] getting late so let's bow our heads just
[7:46] a moment as we look to him and ask him
[7:49] to confirm his word
