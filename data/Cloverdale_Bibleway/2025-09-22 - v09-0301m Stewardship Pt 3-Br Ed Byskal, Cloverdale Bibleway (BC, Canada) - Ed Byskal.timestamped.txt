[3:17] [Music]
[3:25] [Music]
[3:32] our
[3:38] let's bow our hearts before him this
[3:39] morning.
[3:42] Most gracious heavenly father, we thank
[3:44] you today, Lord,
[3:47] for these testimonies of the
[3:49] deliverances, Father, and the healings,
[3:51] Father, and the strength that you've
[3:54] placed into your body, Lord Jesus.
[3:57] And Father, we just want to give thanks
[3:59] and testimony this morning that you're a
[4:02] great God and worthy of all glory and
[4:05] honor and praise this morning. We thank
[4:07] you this morning, Lord, for that which
[4:10] you've already wrought in us and done in
[4:12] us, Lord, and done in our midst. And
[4:15] Father, for raising those up, Father,
[4:19] that were sick in our body and
[4:21] afflicted, Lord. We thank you for that,
[4:23] Lord.
[4:25] Now, Lord, we lift up these other
[4:26] testimonies this morning. Father, the
[4:29] needs in our body, so many we can't
[4:32] remember all of them. We remember
[4:33] Justin. Father, we ask you to touch his
[4:36] body, touch his mind, touch his heart.
[4:39] Lord Jesus, we ask, Father, as I lay my
[4:42] hands on these needs this morning, those
[4:45] that need more believers in their church
[4:47] and in their area, Lord, we ask that you
[4:49] would bring them from the north, the
[4:51] southeast, and the west, Lord Jesus.
[4:55] Father, add to this body as you see fit,
[4:57] Lord Jesus. And Lord, we thank you this
[5:00] morning for doing this, Lord. Father, we
[5:04] have not because we ask not, Lord.
[5:09] And the prophet says, "We ask not
[5:11] because we believe not." Father, we
[5:14] stretch forth our faith this morning,
[5:15] Lord. And we believe you this morning,
[5:18] Lord, that you'll meet every need in
[5:20] divine presence this morning and out
[5:22] over the internet. Lord Jesus, touch the
[5:25] afflicted, those that are in the
[5:26] hospital rooms, those that are in the
[5:28] nursing homes. We remember Brother
[5:30] Edmund right now and Sister Ruth.
[5:33] Father, raise them up and bring them
[5:35] back in our midst. Father, we thank you
[5:38] for that, Lord Jesus,
[5:41] as we call on you this morning,
[5:42] believing that you'll meet every need.
[5:46] [Music]
[5:47] We thank you for it, Lord.
[5:50] Those that are on the mission field this
[5:52] morning.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; We remember Brother Murphy this morning.
[5:56] He's away from us, Lord. A fresh
[5:58] anointing upon him as he ministers.
[6:00] Lord,
[6:01] we thank you for that. We now, Lord, we
[6:04] ask that as the man of God comes this
[6:06] morning, Lord, that you would get the
[6:09] human element out of the way, Lord
[6:10] Jesus, and let him speak as an oracle of
[6:13] God. Father, we're so hungry and thirsty
[6:16] this morning. And we desire to hear from
[6:19] you, Lord Jesus. We pull on the gift of
[6:22] God that you'll stand before us this
[6:24] morning. Lord, bless everyone in the
[6:29] hearing of this word right now. Lord
[6:31] Jesus,
[6:33] as our hearts are prepared to receive
[6:35] from your giving hand,
[6:37] those on the internet again, Lord Jesus,
[6:39] we ask you to bless them. Draw them, our
[6:42] extended family, Lord Jesus. Strengthen
[6:45] their bodies and their minds. And may
[6:47] they also receive from your giving hand
[6:50] today. We give you glory and praise. In
[6:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[6:55] pray. Amen. And amen.
[7:00] You may have your seats.
[7:12] Amen. Our sister Leah Brryer has a
[7:14] special for us. If she could come and
[7:15] get ready at this time, that would be
[7:16] great. And the monitor on the doesn't
[7:18] work, brother. It has slides this
[7:20] morning. So, if we can get that fixed.
[7:23] Perfect. And uh we want to welcome into
[7:26] our midst um brother A Pennar from South
[7:30] Africa. He's come to Canada to stay and
[7:32] to take up a teaching position at Bible
[7:34] Christian Academy. May we get you to
[7:36] stand, brother A, wherever you are. God
[7:39] bless you. Good to have you. Amen.
[7:44] And I trust you feel welcome. And if you
[7:46] can get a chance to shake his hand and
[7:48] welcome yourself that I know that'd be
[7:50] really appreciated.
[8:02] [Music]
[8:11] [Music]
[8:33] We bow and pray
[8:36] [Music]
[8:37] here in your presence.
[8:40] [Music]
[8:41] We come with hearts that are full of
[8:44] thanksgiving for all you have done.
[8:51] There is nothing more that we can give.
[8:56] But for you only daily live a life
[9:00] that's pure and magnifies your name
[9:06] [Music]
[9:07] and show the world that you are still
[9:12] the same.
[9:15] [Music]
[9:17] You set the stars in space and opened up
[9:22] the night.
[9:25] And from your hand each planet fell into
[9:30] place and position.
[9:35] In your eyes
[9:37] lay the sun.
[9:41] May the sun
[9:44] all creation
[9:47] stands
[9:49] before for you
[9:53] to worship
[9:55] and
[9:57] adore you.
[10:00] For all the love
[10:04] you show dear, Lord,
[10:08] I give myself
[10:11] to you.
[10:15] [Music]
[10:17] We bow and pray
[10:21] here in your presence.
[10:25] We come with hearts that are full of
[10:28] thanksgiving for all you have done.
[10:34] There is nothing more that we can give.
[10:39] But for you only daily live a life
[10:43] that's pure and magnifies your name
[10:50] and to show the world that you are still
[10:55] the same.
[11:03] and show the world that you are still
[11:10] the same.
[11:13] [Music]
[11:34] Amen. Brother Larry, why don't you come
[11:36] and bless us with your with your special

[11:56] [Music]
[11:59] Precious
[12:01] blood of Jesus.
[12:08] Oh,
[12:12] Jesus.
[12:17] Yeah.
[12:19] [Music]
[12:22] Heat.
[12:33] Oh
[12:36] Jesus.
[12:43] Jesus.
[12:47] He washes
[12:49] my
[12:51] soul.
[12:54] [Music]
[13:07] [Music]
[13:10] Bless you saints. God bless you.
[13:13] Hallelujah.
[13:16] [Music]
[13:18] I was listening to a message the other
[13:19] day and the prophet says, "We have not
[13:22] because we ask not."
[13:25] And then he went on to say, "We ask not
[13:28] because we believe not."
[13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we must stretch our faith out
[13:33] this morning. Amen. I'd like to dedicate
[13:35] this to Sister Clemens.
[13:38] Bless you, sister.
[13:40] And also, Sister Ruth is in a nursing
[13:43] home this morning.
[13:46] The Lord um laid on my heart to sing
[13:49] this song a few weeks back, but uh it
[13:52] wasn't the right time yet. So just pray
[13:54] for me as I sing.
[13:57] Lord,
[13:59] give us a burden for prayer.
[14:07] Give us a burden for prayer.
[14:15] Our lives they are fleeting.

[19:02] All the children of the world.
[19:06] Red and yellow, black and white, they
[19:09] are precious in his sight. Jesus loves
[19:12] the little children of the world.

[19:39] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that I can be considered one of
[19:43] his little children.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:48] Nice to see the congregation church
[19:51] full.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Is there any way we can get
[19:53] &gt;&gt; already on the pulpit?
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Those on the internet
[19:57] yesterday and today we're anticipating
[19:59] the meeting. We're anticipating
[20:01] communion.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; We want to have communion with you.
[20:04] We'll be taking communion with you. And
[20:07] uh our brother Larry Codle speaks of the
[20:11] extended family, the internet family.
[20:13] God bless you. And here we have a
[20:15] family, a growing family.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; My tell you what, we'll need more
[20:22] classrooms and more church seats.
[20:27] We're so happy for brother John and
[20:29] Sister Leah and their latest edition.
[20:34] It's always special when you they have
[20:36] the grandparents on both sides here.
[20:40] Brother Peter and Sister Barbryer
[20:43] and brother Canon, Sister Linda ordeal.
[20:47] So, it's very special.
[20:50] I was looking to the Lord for just
[20:52] exactly what would be
[20:56] suitable, what would be the mind of God,
[20:59] what he would want for this child, this
[21:03] daughter which they have, Kenzie Ardan.
[21:08] I believe that's correct.
[21:10] And uh a scripture came to my mind,
[21:15] a strange scripture really
[21:19] for a for a daughter, but and yet I want
[21:22] to tie it together with her name.
[21:26] When Monoah, who was Samson's father,
[21:30] h his wife had been visited by an angel
[21:33] of God, who she didn't know was an angel
[21:35] of God. And then Monoah said if he comes
[21:39] again
[21:42] uh we must speak with him and tell him
[21:44] ask him how we must raise this child.
[21:47] And uh the angel of the Lord came and
[21:50] Monoah said to him these words. He said
[21:52] now let thy words come to pass. Let it
[21:55] happen as you have said.
[21:58] How shall we order this the child?
[22:03] And how shall we do unto him?
[22:07] How shall we order this child? And as I
[22:09] as I looked at that, Brother John, it
[22:11] was so fitting to you because it was all
[22:13] legal.
[22:16] The whole meaning was legal and had all
[22:19] the legal terminologies and the
[22:20] litigation and the justice and
[22:22] everything else. It was just incredible.
[22:25] And I thought, well, I can't go through
[22:26] all that because it sound like she's
[22:28] going to be a lawyer. But I
[22:31] But it said, "How shall we order the
[22:33] child?" And the order is in the original
[22:35] Hebrew, "What shall be the manner of the
[22:38] youth's life
[22:40] [Music]
[22:42] and his undertaking,
[22:45] his the judgment and the ordinance, and
[22:48] how shall we order this child? How shall
[22:50] we act?
[22:53] How shall we make decisions for this
[22:56] child? Is not in a court of law now, but
[22:58] it's in raising a child. And I can tell
[23:01] you about raising children a little bit.
[23:04] Anyone who's here is raising children,
[23:06] you're making decisions every day.
[23:09] We need to ask God, what kind of
[23:11] decision shall we make? Give us justice.
[23:15] Give us true judgment.
[23:17] Help us to make the right decision on
[23:20] the child. And how shall we order them?
[23:23] And how shall we lead them? This child
[23:27] that this daughter that
[23:30] brother John and sister Leah have,
[23:32] they've named Kenzie. And it is a this
[23:35] is a bounteous goodness of God.
[23:39] Leah said it's fitting for our fourth
[23:41] child descendant of a handsome man. Wow.
[23:47] And I knew that would bring a smile. But
[23:49] wait till I get to the scriptural part
[23:51] of that.
[23:53] And Ardan is the valley of eagles, a
[23:57] place of refuge
[23:59] and to be fervent. And I think that that
[24:01] is lovely.
[24:03] But the scripture,
[24:05] the scripture in the New Testament says
[24:09] Jesus speaking said talking about the
[24:11] swer and the seed. He said, "But other
[24:15] fell into good ground." And the good is
[24:20] it's a handsome because it's plenteous.
[24:22] It's bountiful.
[24:24] And the word in the Greek comes to
[24:26] handsome. It's good. Good ground. And
[24:30] then it says the good seed brought
[24:33] forth. It was good seed and a good
[24:36] ground. And my heart went out as I
[24:38] thought of this daughter.
[24:42] May the swer of the good seed
[24:46] find good ground
[24:48] &gt;&gt; and and give her a handsome life. And
[24:51] that handsome is good, bountiful spirit,
[24:55] excellent, commendable, admirable,
[24:58] excellent in nature and character and
[25:01] therefore well adapted to its ends. And
[25:04] I said, "Oh God, let her end be eternal
[25:06] life,
[25:09] beautiful by reason of purity of heart
[25:13] and life, and hence praiseworthy. And I
[25:16] pray that she will indeed
[25:19] be beautiful in purity of spirit and
[25:23] character in your home." I'm going to
[25:26] dedicate Kenzie Ardan, the name of the
[25:29] Lord Jesus Christ.
[25:32] Amen.
[25:37] You'll brow with me. Heavenly Father,
[25:39] how gracious you are, how good, how
[25:43] loving, and you have given this gift.
[25:46] And now I pray that you will give great
[25:48] wisdom
[25:50] &gt;&gt; to her parents, to brother John, sister
[25:54] Leah,
[25:55] that they may raise her, that they may
[25:58] have true judgment, true a true
[26:02] understanding to make the kind of
[26:04] decisions that need to be made. May they
[26:06] teach her the ways of eternal life. May
[26:10] they show and demonstrate, Father, that
[26:13] character of our Lord Jesus. And I pray,
[26:16] Father, as you have so graciously given
[26:18] her to them, that now we dedicate Kenzie
[26:23] Ardan in the name of the Lord Jesus
[26:26] Christ. And Lord, I put my hand upon
[26:29] her, unworthy servant, but in yourstead,
[26:32] and ask your blessings upon her in Jesus
[26:36] Christ's name. Amen.
[26:40] Hallelujah.
[26:47] Praise the Lord.
[26:51] Is it all right?
[26:56] God bless you, brother John.
[27:06] Amen.
[27:08] Wonderful to
[27:10] have
[27:12] our sister Lisa St. John and her
[27:15] children here.
[27:18] You wouldn't know it, but they were the
[27:20] children were sick and little Samuel was
[27:23] violently sick yesterday.
[27:26] And I just I believe perhaps uh brother
[27:30] Gary who will come in tomorrow, he's
[27:33] streaming just now. Sister Lisa felt a
[27:36] call. Brother Gary,
[27:38] she had emailed me and asked me to pray.
[27:40] And I went to prayer right away.
[27:43] And uh little Samuel was heaving
[27:48] until there was no more for him to vomit
[27:50] and heave. And he was dry heaving till
[27:53] unto exhaustion.
[27:56] And so, Sister
[27:59] Lisa phoned Gary yesterday between 4:30
[28:02] and 5:00
[28:04] to pray urgently for Samuel.
[28:08] And she said he had thrown up severely
[28:10] all day and had to be carried to the
[28:13] bathroom. He was totally exhausted, had
[28:16] become pale and lethargic.
[28:21] and she said while brother Gary was
[28:24] praying and Anna hope
[28:27] and sister Lisa laid hands on Samuel
[28:30] prayed for him. These are Sister Lisa's
[28:32] words and I said to the congregation to
[28:35] all who knows I don't know what
[28:37] situations are out there. She said it
[28:41] was an absolute miracle.
[28:44] She said I mean instant one. Said I
[28:48] wondered if we had prayed all exactly
[28:49] the same time. But she says the instant
[28:52] the prayer was over I mean literally
[28:55] within one or two minutes at the most
[28:57] all signs of sickness left.
[29:01] Hallelujah.
[29:04] We praise the Lord for that.
[29:08] The fever stopped, the vomiting stopped
[29:11] and he started eating and playing. And
[29:14] we say praise be to God. Hallelujah.
[29:18] When the prophet prayed for people and
[29:19] he told them always go thanking him. And
[29:22] I think that if we have if one rejoices
[29:25] we all rejoice.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; If one thanks him, we all thank him. So
[29:30] I say praise be to God.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; People want to see miracles. You have
[29:35] one.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; We have another. We have all kinds of
[29:38] them happening all the time. Amen. We're
[29:41] so thankful. Thankful for the progress
[29:43] that is taking place in our brother
[29:45] Edwin Dodd's body.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:52] Sister Sally said that she
[29:56] was going to type me an email, but she
[29:59] had to get it okay from brother Edwin.
[30:01] And he nodded at what she was going to
[30:03] be saying, an affirmative.
[30:06] Amen.
[30:07] Ah, that's wonderful. Praise the Lord.
[30:10] Praise the Lord. You realize he's lived
[30:12] long beyond the 70 years.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; I think anything beyond that's a
[30:18] miracle.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if you need another
[30:21] miracle, I'm still standing here.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Pass the time. Amen.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm praying for another miracle. And
[30:31] that's that you'll be wide awake through
[30:33] the rest of service.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; So I've got plenty on my plate this
[30:37] morning. And we're going to get right
[30:39] into the right into the message. And
[30:41] tonight is Lord's table and communion,
[30:44] footwashing.
[30:46] Hallelujah. What a time.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're expecting a good day.
[30:50] Yes, sir.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; And I trust you are.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everyone feeling fine?
[30:57] &gt;&gt; All right. I wonder if we could just
[30:59] sing as you stand. All hail King Jesus.
[31:01] All hail Emmanuel. We want to lift your
[31:05] voice, friends.
[31:07] Give him praise. Just release your
[31:08] heart. Let me just give you a little bit
[31:11] of a secret. Brother Brandham talks
[31:13] about coming into visions.
[31:16] when he comes into visions, he says he
[31:19] has to just yield and yield and yield.
[31:24] And I think that if he has to yield,
[31:26] that's the thing that we should be
[31:27] doing. Just yield. Yield. Hallelujah.
[31:32] This congregation,
[31:35] I'm not interested in how you feel. I'm
[31:37] telling you to just yield to the Holy
[31:39] Spirit. Let's yield to the author of the
[31:42] word. Let's yield that he may come and
[31:45] speak to us individually and everyone
[31:47] else. Let's yield till we can come all
[31:50] into one mind and one voice and one
[31:53] thought.
[31:55] Hallelujah. All hail King Jesus.
[32:07] Oh,
[32:12] [Music]
[32:20] heat,
[32:28] heat.
[32:32] Heat.
[32:37] Heat.
[32:47] Heat.
[33:00] Heat.
[33:09] Oh,
[33:28] I will praise you.
[33:36] Just before we turn to the scripture,
[33:38] let us pray once again. Father, we know
[33:41] that prayer is always in season.
[33:44] And you have sent your son, our Lord
[33:47] Jesus Christ, to be a propitiation
[33:51] to redeem us. And now we are no longer
[33:55] our own.
[33:57] We owe you all that we are, all that we
[34:00] ever can be. We've gathered here today,
[34:03] Lord, to hear from you. And we pray that
[34:06] the Holy Spirit will punctuate the word.
[34:09] We pray that the Holy Spirit will
[34:11] deliver it, old quad. We don't want to
[34:13] hear from man. We want to hear from God.
[34:17] Man's thoughts and man's words will
[34:18] surely fail. But yours, as you said,
[34:21] Lord Jesus, will never pass away. Bless
[34:24] us as we read. Anoint us, oh God. Anoint
[34:28] the people to hear and anoint myself. As
[34:31] I'm standing here responsible to speak,
[34:34] I'm depending entirely upon you in Jesus
[34:38] Christ's name. Bless all who participate
[34:40] today. We thank you in Jesus name. Amen.
[34:45] Amen.
[34:47] I'm going to read in uh
[34:50] in Zechariah
[34:52] the 4th chapter.
[34:57] For those of you that were at the cup
[34:59] this evening,
[35:01] our brother Paul Franos read
[35:06] the seventh verse. I thought that was
[35:08] quite remarkable
[35:11] which we're ending on.
[35:14] And the angel
[35:16] that talked with me came again and w and
[35:19] wake me as a man that is wakened out of
[35:22] his sleep and said unto me, what seeest
[35:25] thou? And I said, I have looked, and
[35:27] behold, a candlestick all of gold, and a
[35:29] bowl upon the top of it, and his and his
[35:33] seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to
[35:36] the seven lamps which are upon the top
[35:39] thereof,
[35:41] and two olive trees by it, one upon the
[35:44] right hand side of the bowl, and the
[35:46] other upon the left side thereof. So I
[35:49] answered, and spake to the angel that
[35:52] talked with me, saying, "What are these,
[35:54] my Lord?" Then the angel that talked
[35:56] with me answered and said unto me,
[35:59] "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I
[36:02] said, "No, my Lord." Then he answered
[36:05] and spake unto me, saying, "This is the
[36:08] word of the Lord unto Zerubabel,
[36:10] saying, Not by might, nor by power, but
[36:15] by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.
[36:19] Who art thou, oh great mountain, before
[36:21] Zerubbabel?
[36:23] Thou shalt become a plain and he shall
[36:26] bring forth a headstone thereof with
[36:28] shoutings crying grace grace unto it.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will read also 1 Peter the 4th
[36:36] chapter which we have been taking in the
[36:39] last uh two services at least
[36:42] and uh as I've been speaking upon
[36:44] stewardship and I will continue today on
[36:48] with stewardship part three but I am
[36:53] really uh anticipating your full
[36:58] cooperation and attentiveness because I
[37:01] want to be able to feel free to move
[37:05] into uh empas reemphasize some things I
[37:09] just touched on in the past and go into
[37:11] it somewhat deeper.
[37:15] And so 1 Peter 4:10 reads, "As every man
[37:19] hath received the gift, even so minister
[37:23] the same one to another as good stewards
[37:27] of the manifold grace of God."
[37:29] Especially coming to communion tonight,
[37:31] we want to think about ministering the
[37:34] same as we've received the gift. And as
[37:38] good stewards of the manifold grace of
[37:41] God, there isn't a single person here in
[37:44] divine presence. But what has not been
[37:47] on the receiving end of the grace of
[37:50] God? And that's what we will be largely
[37:53] speaking about. If any man speak, let
[37:55] him speak as the oracles of God. of any
[37:57] man minister, let him do it as of the
[38:00] ability which God giveth, that God in
[38:04] all things may be glorified, through
[38:07] Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and
[38:10] dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[38:21] The headstone,
[38:25] the unfolding of the headstone,
[38:28] the headstone. At the coming of the
[38:30] headstone,
[38:32] there were shoutings,
[38:35] crying, grace, grace unto it. So
[38:40] obviously, whatever was being made known
[38:44] at the coming of the headstone.
[38:47] And brother Brandham makes some very
[38:49] outstanding
[38:51] very outstanding statements in the
[38:53] message of grace. And I'm going to try
[38:56] to uh
[39:00] have you read uh some of this with me
[39:04] uh just to see if we can have this
[39:09] up.
[39:19] Not up here.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; All right. It's up there.
[39:33] Um
[39:45] now we're right
[39:51] going to just take this very slowly this
[39:54] first part so you can get really get
[39:56] yourself established.
[39:59] In this quote out of the message of
[40:00] grace, brother Brandham said, "We know
[40:02] that this was during the time of the
[40:05] preparation of the restoration of the
[40:07] temple." That was back then.
[40:11] And Zerubbabel was a great prince
[40:14] amongst the people
[40:17] who had laid the foundation
[40:21] of the building.
[40:23] And now you he said I want you to put
[40:25] your spiritual thinking
[40:27] anointing jacket this morning as we
[40:30] thanked.
[40:32] And this great prince had determined to
[40:36] rebuild the house of the Lord.
[40:39] And then when he did, he had laid the
[40:42] foundation stone.
[40:52] God said Zerubabel
[40:55] had laid the foundation with his hands.
[40:58] He also shall bring forth the headstone.
[41:02] And I want you to notice he never said
[41:04] shall bring forth the cornerstone.
[41:07] He shall bring forth the headstone.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; And we know that the scripture says that
[41:13] Jesus is the chief cornerstone
[41:16] &gt;&gt; and he's also the headstone. Amen.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Now, if we will think for a few minutes
[41:23] that the and this is the striking part
[41:25] that the seventh church age messenger
[41:29] was to restore the faith of the children
[41:32] back to the fathers. In other words,
[41:36] rebuild the church again under the power
[41:40] of the spirit.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is going back to
[41:44] Zachchariah. the prophecy in Zachchariah
[41:47] as concerning what the Zerubabel
[41:51] shall do and he had laid the foundation
[41:54] stone shall bring the headstone and he
[41:57] and he now re brings that and takes a
[42:00] quantum leap from that time to this day.
[42:04] He said he wants us to think because in
[42:07] other words the the seventh church age
[42:10] messenger was to restore the faith of
[42:13] the children back to the fathers. In
[42:15] other words rebuild the church again
[42:18] under the power of the spirit. So
[42:21] actually what we are participating in
[42:24] and what we are engaged in we are
[42:27] literally connected to Zechariah the 4th
[42:30] chapter. This is a further part of it.
[42:34] This is really what that was reflecting.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; That was the negative. This is the
[42:39] positive.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Then he goes, "Not by power and not by
[42:46] might, but by my spirit, saith the Lord,
[42:50] not by organization,
[42:52] and not by denomination, but by the Holy
[42:56] Spirit, God will bring forth the church
[42:59] in the last days." Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; And we can say amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; He has brought forth the church in the
[43:05] last days.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Zachchariah. Now the scripture that we
[43:08] have just read, who art thou, oh
[43:11] mountain before Zerubabel, thou shalt
[43:14] become a plain,
[43:16] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[43:18] thereof with shoutings, crying grace,
[43:22] grace unto it.
[43:25] shoutings crying grace grace
[43:29] at the coming of the headstone.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Now, he goes on to say,
[43:37] we've got theologians today. We've got
[43:40] doctors of divinity. We've got great men
[43:42] all over the world that's smart,
[43:45] intelligent, and educated. But it takes
[43:49] the simplicity of believing God to make
[43:53] his word speak out to show. In other
[43:57] words, his word speaks out to show that
[44:00] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[44:02] today, and forever.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; But it takes the simplicity of believing
[44:08] God to make his word speak out to show
[44:11] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[44:14] today, and forever.
[44:16] Not by might, not by power or by might,
[44:21] but by my spirit, saith God, I'll unfold
[44:26] this mystery
[44:28] &gt;&gt; and he'll cry to it.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; In other words, at the unfolding of the
[44:33] mystery,
[44:36] &gt;&gt; he will cry to it.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Grace, grace with shoutings and cryings.
[44:43] And that's what it is when
[44:46] &gt;&gt; today.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; God's amazing grace
[44:53] &gt;&gt; to his people.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; And every man hath received the gift.
[45:01] Every man hath received the gift. Even
[45:04] so, minister the same one to another. We
[45:07] have received this great gift that's
[45:10] been unfolded on in the unfolding of the
[45:13] word. Who knows the full depth of
[45:17] justification but the bride of Jesus
[45:19] Christ.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; And when the mysteries unfolded
[45:23] there is crying to it to the headstone.
[45:27] Grace grace
[45:28] &gt;&gt; with shoutings and cryings. Grace grace.
[45:33] When we found out the truth, the mystery
[45:36] of predestination.
[45:37] I was predestinated before the
[45:40] foundation of the world. It can only do
[45:42] one thing with shoutings, crying, grace,
[45:45] grace,
[45:46] &gt;&gt; unworthy,
[45:48] &gt;&gt; unworthy, unmmerited.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Ranked sinners.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Ranked sinners in darkness. What can we
[45:57] say? Nothing. All except shoutings,
[46:01] crying, grace, grace unto it
[46:03] &gt;&gt; to the high headstone.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Grace, grace,
[46:09] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Glorious grace.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Grace,
[46:20] the manifold, the word of manifold is
[46:24] grace of many different kinds.
[46:27] He showed grace to Adam. He showed grace
[46:30] to Noah. He showed grace, and we'll come
[46:32] into it. He showed grace to Abraham. He
[46:35] showed grace to all the prophets. He
[46:37] showed grace to David.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Grace and grace in its fullness came in
[46:43] the form of Jesus Christ who was full
[46:47] &gt;&gt; permeated with. That's all he was was
[46:50] full of grace and truth.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:57] Manifold grace is grace manifested in
[47:00] many ways. Grace the essential
[47:04] ingredient in every believer's life. To
[47:07] multiply something, not to take
[47:09] something away, but to add something.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Grace gives power to overcome the
[47:19] repeated buffeting of Satan.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[47:24] Paul said in Corinthians, "And lest I
[47:26] should be exalted above measure through
[47:28] the abundance of the revelation,
[47:31] there was a given to me a thorn in the
[47:33] flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet
[47:35] me, lest I should be exalted above
[47:38] measure." Those of you in the have come
[47:41] to the knowledge of Christ in the
[47:43] message of the hour, there's nothing
[47:45] like it that there is on earth. But lest
[47:48] we become uh exalted uh over the
[47:52] abundance of revelation, I believe that
[47:54] sometimes we experience the buffeting of
[47:58] Satan for the thing I besought of the
[48:01] Lord thrice that it might depart from
[48:03] me. And perhaps you and I have asked the
[48:06] Lord more than that. And he said unto
[48:09] me, my grace is sufficient. So grace is
[48:12] more than equal to buffeting.
[48:16] For my strength is made perfect in
[48:18] weakness. And most gladly therefore will
[48:21] I rather glory in my infirmities, that
[48:23] the power of Christ might rest upon me.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Except I would be exalted above the
[48:32] abundance of revelation there was given
[48:34] me, this is the scripture, a messenger
[48:36] of the devil, a thorn in the flesh to
[48:38] buffet me. He and brother Brandham is
[48:41] quoting this. He'd get better for a
[48:43] while. Paul, speaking of Paul, then away
[48:45] it would go again. Buffet means blow
[48:47] after blow like the ship on the sea. He
[48:50] said, you know, the waves buffet it blow
[48:53] after blow. He'd get better and then
[48:56] he'd have it again and then he'd get
[48:58] better and he'd have it again. And he
[49:00] said, Lord, what's the matter that you
[49:02] don't take this thing away from me? And
[49:03] he said, "My grace is sufficient for
[49:06] you."
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just grace, but grace.
[49:11] Grace.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:13] Amen.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you get buffeted,
[49:16] &gt;&gt; and there isn't anybody that doesn't get
[49:18] buffeted when you get buffeted again and
[49:20] again, blow after blow, remember there's
[49:23] grace
[49:24] &gt;&gt; that's sufficient
[49:25] &gt;&gt; and more than sufficient for all of
[49:27] these things.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; We are here to live a life that
[49:33] expresses this grace.
[49:36] The prophet said
[49:38] in a hidden life he said the best thing
[49:40] is to live a sermon instead of preach
[49:43] one.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; And he said you know that your written
[49:47] epistles. So we are stewards of
[49:50] &gt;&gt; we are managers. We are to manage and
[49:53] conduct ourselves in such a way of the
[49:56] grace. This grace of many different
[49:59] kinds. This grace of many different
[50:02] manifests itself in many different ways.
[50:05] This grace that is an absolute essential
[50:08] ingredient to the believer's life.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Grace manifested many ways. And not only
[50:15] that, grace that is more than sufficient
[50:18] to every age and every condition.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; As I said a moment ago, grace was
[50:25] present in Eden. And I want to take this
[50:28] in just uh the segments. I want to look
[50:31] at Eden. I want to look at Moses and the
[50:34] children of Israel. I want to look at
[50:37] Jesus time. And I want to look at our
[50:39] time which is the revealing of the son
[50:41] of man in our day.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; And and also I want to point out that
[50:46] the that the that in every situation it
[50:50] was manifested in so many different
[50:52] ways. In the days of of the Garden of
[50:55] Eden when God came with grace for Adam
[50:58] and Eve, they didn't have a law. They
[51:01] didn't have ten commandments written on
[51:04] stone. They didn't have that. So it was
[51:07] that was one way. And then it came in
[51:10] Moses time. It came a different way. But
[51:12] I want to also stress that the law that
[51:16] eventually came through Moses, the law
[51:20] law, there's a paradox here. And the
[51:23] paradox is is a like a statement that's
[51:26] hard to believe, but yet it's true or it
[51:29] could be true. And the paradox is that
[51:32] condemnation
[51:34] and guilt must be present for grace to
[51:39] appear.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; If you've had grace, if you've
[51:44] experienced grace, it's only because
[51:46] you've been guilty.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; That should have had a louder amen
[51:51] &gt;&gt; if you really realize that.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I was guilty." No,
[51:56] if it was not for the grace, we would be
[51:58] guilty at this moment.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Says, "How can we be accused? How can we
[52:05] suffer a penalty when we have the token
[52:08] with us? But if you didn't have the
[52:11] token,
[52:12] &gt;&gt; you're guilty.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; But with it's the token. And the token
[52:17] came by what? By grace.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; We weren't worthy of it. We couldn't do
[52:23] anything to get us. Well, I went to the
[52:25] altar. The altar had nothing to do with
[52:27] the grace coming to you.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; It just happened to be a moment when God
[52:31] moved on you. I I was in distress and I
[52:34] called on the Lord and he came and and
[52:37] and and met me.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; It wasn't it wasn't the fact that you
[52:45] necessarily called on the Lord or that
[52:47] you got in a state of crisis. It was the
[52:50] grace of God that even allowed the
[52:52] crisis.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; It was the grace of God that allowed you
[52:57] to your distress. That was the grace
[53:00] already coming to you. Sometimes we
[53:03] think, well, it just the the grace was
[53:05] just a goodness that came. No, sometimes
[53:08] it in in in most every case, it's the
[53:11] grace of God that pressed you and moved
[53:14] you and squeezed you until you did cry
[53:17] out.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; And then grace, grace came.
[53:23] And when we have been recipients of the
[53:26] grace,
[53:27] &gt;&gt; then there's one thing left for us to
[53:29] do, and that is with shoutings and
[53:31] cryings back to it. Grace, grace.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Grace, grace,
[53:39] &gt;&gt; this headstone
[53:41] &gt;&gt; coming to us at this time.
[53:47] So we beheld his glory
[53:50] &gt;&gt; as the glory of the only begotten of the
[53:52] father full of grace and truth.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Oh the love that drew salvation's plan.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Oh the grace that brought it down to
[54:03] man.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Oh the mighty gulf that God did span at
[54:07] where?
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Calvary.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. in a message when love projects
[54:14] I'd like you to just notice this
[54:18] he said now
[54:20] that's when we come he said to these
[54:23] crises
[54:25] everybody has been to their crisis
[54:29] and your crisis might not seem as such a
[54:33] great thing to someone else but
[54:37] only only one knows
[54:40] really what goes on in the heart.
[54:43] You may have the dearest friend. You may
[54:46] have your spouse
[54:49] regardless of how many years you have
[54:50] lived together.
[54:52] You may have the most blessed union.
[54:56] But you will come and you will go
[54:59] through crisis that you can share with
[55:02] no one.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; And if you don't understand that, just
[55:08] take it from me. You can experience
[55:11] that.
[55:13] Brother Brandham came to a crisis.
[55:16] He says, "And that when sovereign grace
[55:19] steps in."
[55:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then something happened in my
[55:23] life." He said, "I wish if it ever comes
[55:26] again that it'll never leave."
[55:30] &gt;&gt; It's going to surprise you what he's
[55:32] even speaking about.
[55:34] He says, "And I only wish that there was
[55:36] some way that I could and that I had the
[55:39] power this morning to project that to
[55:42] this group,
[55:45] this group of men and women here, and
[55:48] that it never leave you." Said, "Like
[55:51] when the maniac in Oregon, it was in
[55:54] Portland, Oregon, the maniac that came
[55:59] and he ran up to the platform to kill
[56:02] me.
[56:09] He said something happened there.
[56:13] He said, "You've often wondered, I
[56:15] guess, how those things happen. It's
[56:17] something in thestead of despising that
[56:20] man." Yes, sir.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Though he was there to take my life,
[56:24] number one,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; a divine law set in for him. Amen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; And he called me a hypocrite
[56:34] and a snake in the grass and thousands
[56:37] of people sitting there and he spat in
[56:40] my face. Do you know what he was doing?
[56:42] He was in the he was actually in the
[56:45] throws of blaspheming
[56:49] &gt;&gt; in the midst of his blasphemy. Yeah.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; And he says the people sitting there and
[56:56] he spat in his my face and drew back his
[56:59] fist and he said I'll break every bone
[57:02] in your body. Brother Brandham actually
[57:04] described this event to me and I've
[57:07] heard it from his lips but I'm reading
[57:09] it to you and he tells me drew back his
[57:12] fist. Said he was a big man towering
[57:14] over brother Brandham says I'll I'll
[57:16] break every bone in your body.
[57:19] He said, "But instead of despising the
[57:21] man, something he said grace
[57:25] &gt;&gt; came in."
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Now remember, he said he wishes he could
[57:30] come to this place and never have it
[57:32] leave him.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; And he says he wishes that he could
[57:35] bring it to the people at that time. And
[57:38] I said, "Oh God, bring it to us. Don't
[57:40] leave us out."
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:45] Don't let us become so stayed and so
[57:48] secure in our own self. Let us realize
[57:51] that if it wasn't for this moment, we'd
[57:53] pass off the scene. If it wasn't for
[57:55] gracemen,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; he said something came in. Grace came
[58:02] in.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; In a moment when I needed it, grace
[58:06] steps in and projected a divine love in
[58:08] my heart that I could project to him.
[58:12] And I thought, there stands a man,
[58:17] a man like I am.
[58:20] He said he likes to eat and drink and
[58:23] his family, but the devil has him bound.
[58:27] So the love of God, he said, constrained
[58:31] me.
[58:34] The love of God constrained me. And the
[58:37] man humbled himself and fell across my
[58:39] feet. He said grace stepped in when love
[58:43] was projected.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; It took the this extremely dangerous
[58:53] condition and crisis
[58:56] to create the opportunity for grace to
[58:58] come pouring through.
[59:02] It's the paradox. And here's the
[59:04] paradox. A statement or situation. And
[59:07] this was a situation that seems to be
[59:10] contradictory,
[59:12] but in fact, it may be true. It would
[59:15] seem to be contradictory to me. And I'm
[59:18] sure there'd be some deacons that would
[59:19] come forward very quickly if a man came
[59:23] towering over me, threatening, spitting
[59:26] in my face, and pulling back his fist,
[59:29] getting ready to break every bone and
[59:31] tear me from limb to limb. I'm sure
[59:34] there'd be people that would want to,
[59:36] but there were others that wanted to
[59:38] come and brother Brandham held them
[59:40] back. This would be a paradox. Here's a
[59:43] man that is being raged and filled with
[59:46] demonic power and the other man being
[59:49] filled with divine love
[59:52] &gt;&gt; and the love overcoming the demon power.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; The love overcoming the blasphemer.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And all we can do is shout grace. Grace
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; was grace. Grace
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; coming through.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Grace can only exist
[1:00:16] when guilt and condemnation is present.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; These are the principles of the
[1:00:22] unchanging God is right from the very
[1:00:24] beginning of time.
[1:00:26] And mercy and grace are attributes of
[1:00:29] God which can never be diminished. Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; They can never lessen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to the mercy seat as
[1:00:39] we've had many questions perhaps not us
[1:00:42] but some uh of you and uh there's been
[1:00:46] those who have been caught up that mercy
[1:00:48] was over. I'll read that I'll read that
[1:00:51] question that was made to brother
[1:00:53] Brandham cuz he's off the mercy seat and
[1:00:55] he opened up the seals and that's why
[1:00:57] the mysteries have been revealed and he
[1:00:59] moved from the mercy seat. The mercy
[1:01:01] seat is not a chair.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; The mercy seat is not a physical
[1:01:05] location.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; The mercy seat is simply a uh it it is
[1:01:09] it is the uh it is an attribute of God
[1:01:13] and God gave access to that attribute
[1:01:16] under one under one formula at one time
[1:01:19] and then he changes it.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; And then I'll show you in the scripture
[1:01:23] that this no longer they could no longer
[1:01:25] get access to it but only this.
[1:01:29] That's right.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; So as you listen closely,
[1:01:34] there are attributes of God. It's an
[1:01:36] attribute of God that cannot diminish.
[1:01:39] Now also in the message of grace,
[1:01:43] brother Brandon goes to the garden. In
[1:01:45] the garden that morning when sin was so
[1:01:47] black,
[1:01:49] Jehovah came in.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; There stood his couple standing
[1:01:53] condemned. Condemnation and guilt must
[1:01:58] can only exist
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; before grace. Now, brother Brandon said
[1:02:03] grace was there before condemnation. Of
[1:02:05] course, it was
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; because the God of grace
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; was present. Yes, sir.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; He says, but there they stood condemned.
[1:02:12] He says, "And there would be no human
[1:02:13] race." Think of it. No human race would
[1:02:16] come on the scene. He says they had to
[1:02:19] die. Death on the human race. give the
[1:02:23] world back to the wild beasts and there
[1:02:26] had been no human race. But in the
[1:02:29] darkest of hour,
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; in the time when all hopes was gone, you
[1:02:35] might come into that moment. You might
[1:02:37] experience that in the darkest hour. And
[1:02:40] in the time that all hope was gone,
[1:02:44] grace came pouring through.
[1:02:49] I decided to make that one of my
[1:02:52] favorite statements. Grace came pouring
[1:02:55] through
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; in your dark hour. And I know for every
[1:03:00] one of you, you've hit that place. And
[1:03:03] in our dark hour, grace came pouring
[1:03:06] through.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And we all have to say to the headstone
[1:03:11] with shoutings, grace, grace.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Why don't you say it with me? You'll
[1:03:17] feel better. Grace, grace unto it.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; In my darkest hour, grace came pouring
[1:03:27] through.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; We speak of camp and some of the things
[1:03:34] that just happened at camp. I'll say to
[1:03:36] you young men and you young ladies,
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; it wasn't, you know, that you called or
[1:03:40] that you prayed or someone else even
[1:03:42] preached.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; It was God's grace.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. to you.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; you deserve to die.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; You deserve to go to hell.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; We all did.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; That was our due.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; That was what was due to us.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; There isn't anybody here that say,
[1:04:03] "Well, I forget it.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; You deserved hell."
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Every one of us deserved hell.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; It was the grace of God.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Grace came pouring through.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And now you can say, "Oh, hallelujah."
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; With shoutings, "Grace, grace unto it."
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it needs to come from
[1:04:30] the very depths of your soul.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; You need to see yourself condemned. You
[1:04:35] need to see yourself guilty. You need to
[1:04:38] see yourself uh due to hell itself. And
[1:04:41] then say, "Oh, grace.
[1:04:44] All grace of God.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Grace, grace unto it.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; I can speak for some. I was raised in a
[1:04:58] Christian home,
[1:05:00] born in a Catholic home, but my parents
[1:05:04] came to know the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:05:06] the power of the flames of the early
[1:05:08] flames of Pentecost.
[1:05:10] Say, "Well, that was the grace of God."
[1:05:12] Yes, indeed it was. But it only gave me
[1:05:14] religion.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; It only gave me religion. I'm happy for
[1:05:19] it.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; It kept me kept me clean.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; It held me
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; held me through my teens. I was able to
[1:05:27] leave a lead a clean life, but I was
[1:05:29] still hellbound.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; And I was still worthy of hell.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Living clean down here doesn't make you
[1:05:37] worthy of anything.
[1:05:40] may give you a better life here. It
[1:05:42] will, but it doesn't make you more
[1:05:44] worthy than the prostitute or the
[1:05:46] drunkard that comes in the door.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; You need to say amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; That's the truth of God's word.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; So paradox,
[1:06:03] that was a paradox.
[1:06:08] So grace came pouring through
[1:06:12] and he said, "I'll give you a savior."
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; That's grace.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; A Messiah,
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; that's grace.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Or the promise of the just one that
[1:06:23] should come through the woman. That's
[1:06:24] grace.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; And the woman's seed shall bruise the
[1:06:28] serpent's head. Hallelujah.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; I want to shout hallelujah.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's a song, an old song
[1:06:38] that comes to my mind. I just want to
[1:06:40] shout hallelujah.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish I could sing that song for
[1:06:45] you. I just want to shout hallelujah.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Grace. Grace.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. You'll never
[1:06:54] live long enough and you'll never have
[1:06:56] enough breath to say grace. Grace too
[1:06:58] many times.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; So, you might as well start right now.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; We're probably in debt. Yes,
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; we're probably in debt having not said
[1:07:06] it enough.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; The coming of the headstone was supposed
[1:07:10] to create something within the people.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Didn't make them a bunch of stones just
[1:07:15] bumps on a log. It It caused crying and
[1:07:19] shouting grace. Grace unto it.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, I'm going to
[1:07:30] have a revival whether you have it or
[1:07:32] not. Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; What provided a savior?
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Grace.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; In the days of Noah, the scripture says,
[1:07:50] "And God saw
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; the wickedness of man." Yeah,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; It was great upon the earth
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; and that every imagination of the
[1:08:04] thought was of his heart was only only
[1:08:07] only
[1:08:09] evil continually.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; I heard where some theologians had
[1:08:13] studied that scripture
[1:08:16] for a very long time
[1:08:18] trying to strengthen and make more
[1:08:22] potent those words. And after they had
[1:08:26] exhausted all of their research and all
[1:08:29] of their wisdom, they said that they
[1:08:31] could not find a way to make this
[1:08:33] scripture more powerful, more potent,
[1:08:36] and having more meaning. They could not
[1:08:39] strengthen it when it says, "And God saw
[1:08:41] the wickedness of man and that every
[1:08:45] imagination
[1:08:46] of the thoughts of his heart was only
[1:08:50] evil continually
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; and it repented the Lord that he had
[1:08:55] made man on the earth and it grieved him
[1:08:59] to his heart." And the Lord said, "I
[1:09:02] will destroy
[1:09:05] man whom I've created upon the face of
[1:09:07] the earth." As the prophet said, "Give
[1:09:09] him back to the beasts."
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; God was at the verge of it there. I'll
[1:09:15] give it back to the wild animals. I'll
[1:09:17] give it back to the rest of my creation.
[1:09:19] I'm sorry I made man.
[1:09:23] But
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; but
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Noah
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; found grace.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; He found it.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And the word found means he attained to
[1:09:39] it. He secured it. He got a hold of it.
[1:09:42] Grace,
[1:09:45] [Applause]
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Noah found grace
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; in the sight of the Lord.
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know what the population was,
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; but one man,
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; I can I cannot stress that too much, but
[1:10:04] one man
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; found grace
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; in the eyes of the Lord.
[1:10:09] And that has repeated itself
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; over the centuries of time
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; when the world was in such a state and
[1:10:17] finally God would find one man
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; as he did in this generation.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Think, oh, we have all of our religion
[1:10:26] and all of our theology and all of our
[1:10:28] schools. It means nothing. Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; All of our churches and all of our
[1:10:32] singing and all of our ceremony and all
[1:10:34] of the worship and all of everything
[1:10:36] else means nothing outside of God
[1:10:39] extending his grace to us.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "Noah found grace in the
[1:10:51] sight of the Lord."
[1:10:54] It's got down many times to one man,
[1:10:57] but God always has had a witness
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; that he could put his hands on and say,
[1:11:04] "This
[1:11:05] is my servant."
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; I tell him to go and he goes.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; I tell him to do this and he will do it.
[1:11:13] Regardless of what the church says or
[1:11:16] what the people says, he will do it
[1:11:18] anyhow. God has a witness.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; In the third Exodus, he said he tried
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; he's tried to get it through every age.
[1:11:34] If he could only get one man,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; he got one man in the days of Noah.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; He got one man in the days of Elijah. He
[1:11:42] had one man in the days of John the
[1:11:44] Baptist. Just one man is all he needs.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. if he only needs
[1:11:50] one man. What do we have here today? If
[1:11:53] there's a people that can say, "I've
[1:11:55] been purchased by this grace and I will
[1:11:58] be that woman and I will be that man."
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Because I can tell you in some in many
[1:12:04] cases, you're the only person that can
[1:12:07] reach somebody.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; It's not given that everybody will talk
[1:12:10] to your neighbor or talk to your friend
[1:12:13] or talk to your family. It's you.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you alone.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; One man.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Some of you young people, I see Mitch
[1:12:22] here that just was baptized. I'm
[1:12:24] thinking not only of Mitch. I'm thinking
[1:12:25] of someone that only he can reach.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; And that's what we have to think of.
[1:12:30] Someone that only you can reach.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And you are the grace of God going to
[1:12:38] them. And God has made you a steward of
[1:12:40] that grace.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; You're in charge of that grace. He's
[1:12:46] committed it to you
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; and you are to respect it.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Be careful
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; that that which has been given you
[1:12:59] doesn't become law.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; As it did in the scriptures,
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; we'll be coming to it.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Grace. Grace is not greasy grace. Grace.
[1:13:11] Grace is not grace that just allows
[1:13:14] people to live any way they are. Grace
[1:13:16] is at your mind your own affairs and
[1:13:19] realize that God has given to you a
[1:13:22] deposit that you are the recipient of
[1:13:25] grace and you are so consumed with what
[1:13:28] you have received of God unmmerited
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; unworthy of it
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; doesn't raise us up to be judges
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; right
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; doesn't raise us up and give us
[1:13:43] authority
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; to hand
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; and be responsible for everyone else's
[1:13:48] life.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; God has given you a deposit of grace.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; How did that come to you? A wretched
[1:13:55] unworthy person.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Grace.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; And if it wasn't for that grace, you'd
[1:14:02] be guilty at this moment.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "Well, the blood of Jesus
[1:14:06] Christ washed my sins away." Listen, if
[1:14:09] he if the blood of Jesus Christ wasn't
[1:14:11] effective and had its efficacy for you
[1:14:14] at this moment, you'd still be guilty
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; because he didn't come and and and give
[1:14:21] you uh uh this measure of grace for a
[1:14:24] specific period of time, but it's for
[1:14:26] all all eternity.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; In uncertain sound.
[1:14:34] And as I'm preaching today,
[1:14:37] don't sit there and say, "Oh, I think
[1:14:39] he's trying to refer to this." You want
[1:14:41] to believe I'm referring to it.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not beating beating around the bush.
[1:14:47] I'm speaking directly
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; to issues and needs.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; And this is God's word to you today.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Some of this has come to me over a
[1:14:59] period of many years. and I've just held
[1:15:02] in my heart
[1:15:05] especially that when I come to the
[1:15:07] compound at law and it'll be quiet here
[1:15:10] as it was the other Sunday.
[1:15:13] Some of you weren't here.
[1:15:18] you maybe feel see there's a sense of
[1:15:20] we're humans and there's a sense of you
[1:15:23] know we feel
[1:15:25] justified and we feel we're we are a-ok
[1:15:27] okay
[1:15:29] but in order for you to really
[1:15:32] experience the depth of the grace of God
[1:15:36] you have to see what he's brought you
[1:15:37] from
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; and what you would be at this moment if
[1:15:42] it wasn't for his grace his grace at
[1:15:44] this moment where would you be
[1:15:48] I can tell you if it wasn't for his
[1:15:50] grace, even at this moment, that nature,
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Satan would soon anoint that nature. And
[1:15:56] who knows where you would be.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; You'll be out in some dark hobble
[1:16:01] someplace. Your home's broken.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Some of you would be already buried in a
[1:16:07] grave, a Christless grave, if it wasn't
[1:16:10] for the grace of God.
[1:16:13] You'd be on the street seeking out some
[1:16:15] entertainment or some enjoyment. You'd
[1:16:18] be gone.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for the grace of God
[1:16:22] holding you
[1:16:26] [Applause]
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:30] Hallelujah. With shouting grace grace
[1:16:34] unto it.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; But I am not going to hold this meeting
[1:17:01] back.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; I don't care what time it is.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; We might carry right on to communion. I
[1:17:09] don't know.
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:13] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; I give my heart to you, Lord.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Let the headstone be praised.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Let the headstone hear
[1:17:30] the people that he's redeemed. Let the
[1:17:33] people of the Lord say so.
[1:17:35] [Applause]
[1:17:37] be so good to
[1:17:40] be someone to
[1:17:44] let it be good to me.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; There was one man in the days of Daniel.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Only one man could understand the
[1:17:57] handwriting on the wall. Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; One man in the whole nation
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; that stood against the wrong
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; in the days of Micaiah.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; One man,
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; all the hundreds of ministers and
[1:18:11] preachers prophesied
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; different from his prophecy.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And he prophesied and spoke against the
[1:18:18] whole nation.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; One man.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here today and we all
[1:18:27] are.
[1:18:29] rejoicing in what God has made known.
[1:18:31] But if I were to take you back for a
[1:18:32] moment, I can guarantee you there was a
[1:18:35] time when God
[1:18:38] in his extra measure of grace had laid
[1:18:42] his hand upon a young boy.
[1:18:47] And that young boy when he grew to be a
[1:18:49] man and became a prophet of God, a
[1:18:51] messenger to this generation said the
[1:18:54] Brandon family,
[1:18:57] they were not well thought of.
[1:19:00] People would walk on the other side of
[1:19:01] the street. People wouldn't want to be
[1:19:03] identified with them because he said, he
[1:19:05] said their family was considered as as
[1:19:08] drunkards
[1:19:10] from their alcohol.
[1:19:12] And this is exactly what he said.
[1:19:16] He said, "The family of Brandon didn't
[1:19:18] have a very good name around here on
[1:19:21] account of drinking.
[1:19:24] Nobody had nothing to do with me.
[1:19:28] And just remember that I couldn't get
[1:19:29] anyone to talk to talk to me. Nobody
[1:19:33] cared for me. And now I have to hide to
[1:19:36] get a little rest
[1:19:39] here." He already was born a prophet.
[1:19:42] And if you had lived as a neighbor to
[1:19:44] the Brandham family, I doubt very much
[1:19:47] that you would have had such divine
[1:19:49] revelation that you would have seen
[1:19:51] something uh divine happening and
[1:19:54] something of a supernatural nature. Now
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid we would have been all in the
[1:20:01] mostly in the company of everyone else
[1:20:03] and say, "Well, you know that family,
[1:20:05] they're a bunch of drinkers.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Mr. Brandham has a alcohol. He's got a
[1:20:11] still up there.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; His son hauls the water to the still
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; and little would we realize that there
[1:20:18] was a wind
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; blowing in a tree with a voice speaking
[1:20:24] out to him.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; What grace?
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; I've got to shout hallelujah.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; What grace?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; It wasn't for him. It was for us. Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; It was for you.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Grace.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Grace.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Coming to the darkest
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; of ages and the most deceived of people.
[1:20:58] the most religious,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; I doubt if we would ever recognized it.
[1:21:10] It was grace that called
[1:21:13] the first prophet that was ever to come.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Moses,
[1:21:21] it was grace when his parents put him.
[1:21:24] Well, I I'm sorry, but I I just have to
[1:21:27] say it. It was grace when when they
[1:21:29] pushed him off into the River Nile.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; It was grace.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; It was grace that he was even raised in
[1:21:37] Pharaoh's
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; kingdom.
[1:21:40] But the prophet said, and I must just go
[1:21:42] along quickly,
[1:21:44] it was grace come pouring through. I'll
[1:21:47] keep using that phrase.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; An escape. Grace provided a profit.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Grace provided them an escape out
[1:21:56] of Egypt. I've took these from a lot of
[1:21:58] different places where brother Brandham
[1:22:00] spoke about grace coming to the people
[1:22:02] at that time because I think it should
[1:22:04] relate to us.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Grace gave them an escape out of Egypt.
[1:22:10] It
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; was grace that brought you gave you an
[1:22:12] escape out of the world.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; You too had task masters.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Cruel task masters.
[1:22:23] You too hated some of your habits and
[1:22:25] things and there was no power to break
[1:22:28] it within yourself. Grace came pouring
[1:22:30] through.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:34] [Applause]
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; You didn't earn it. You didn't do
[1:22:37] anything good for it. You didn't say
[1:22:39] anything right. You didn't do anything
[1:22:41] right. It was grace. Amen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Grace gave them a smitten rock.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Grace gave them the brass serpent.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Grace gave them an atonement.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Grace gave them a Passover lamb and a
[1:23:03] sacrifice. Grace gave them a covenant.
[1:23:06] Grace gave them an angel.
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:11] They could travel by grace and grace
[1:23:14] provided them with one of the greatest
[1:23:16] revivals they ever had. But the prophet
[1:23:19] said
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; they wanted a law.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; It's human.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; They wanted a law
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; to live by.
[1:23:38] He said, "And after all the blessings
[1:23:39] had come to Israel, yet they wanted
[1:23:42] Exodus 19, they wanted a law.
[1:23:48] They wanted to have something that they
[1:23:49] could do themselves."
[1:23:52] In spiritual jobs, he said, "You give us
[1:23:54] something. You give us something to do."
[1:23:57] He's he's speaking on behalf of the
[1:23:59] children of Israel. "You give us
[1:24:00] something to do to merit our salvation.
[1:24:02] We'll keep a law if you'll give it to
[1:24:04] us."
[1:24:05] In other words, but it never was God's
[1:24:08] plan.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And here's where it changes, friends.
[1:24:14] Here's where we shift gears.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; And God gave them a law
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; and condemned every one of them.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; And made everyone guilty before God.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Have to be very careful
[1:24:30] what you choose.
[1:24:35] you under the law,
[1:24:38] all of Israel was condemned.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; There were virgins there and they were
[1:24:46] condemned.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; There were fine young men there. There
[1:24:51] were families there and they were all
[1:24:53] condemned.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; And the Apostle Paul says this quickly.
[1:24:58] I would like to have had this on the
[1:24:59] screen for you, but listen very closely.
[1:25:02] Therefore, by the deeds of the law,
[1:25:04] there shall no
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; and lo, no flesh be justified. Doesn't
[1:25:10] matter how good that flesh is. Doesn't
[1:25:12] matter how it was raised. Doesn't matter
[1:25:14] what kind of standards a family had. No
[1:25:17] flesh would be justified by the deeds of
[1:25:19] the law.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, we're not under
[1:25:24] the law." I got surprised for you.
[1:25:26] You're under a magnified law.
[1:25:28] You're under a compounded law
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; that made sure
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; that you wouldn't escape.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to prove it by the scripture.
[1:25:47] Now we know Paul said in Romans also
[1:25:50] that what things soever the law sayith
[1:25:52] it sith to them who are under the law
[1:25:55] that every mouth might be stopped.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Do you have a mouth?
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; The law was given and the compounded
[1:26:03] law. Brother Brandham calls it the
[1:26:04] magnified law. It came so our mouths
[1:26:07] could be stopped.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the mouth that's speaking
[1:26:14] it also is condemned.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Are you speaking about a
[1:26:24] certain something?" I'm speaking about
[1:26:25] every person here.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; There's no mouth
[1:26:32] that has
[1:26:34] the ability
[1:26:36] or has the liberty and is freed from the
[1:26:41] grace of God. outside the grace of God.
[1:26:43] And the grace of God shouts for
[1:26:45] yourself.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; No law that every mouth may be stopped.
[1:26:54] That's not the end of that.
[1:26:57] And all the world,
[1:27:01] are you in the world?
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; All the world may become guilty before
[1:27:05] God. That's why it came.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. The law didn't come to make some
[1:27:10] just and some condemned. It came to
[1:27:12] condemn all.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; And you say, "This is such a harsh
[1:27:16] thing, brother Biscll. It's such a harsh
[1:27:18] thing." You have to be condemned before
[1:27:21] you can be the recipient of grace.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I was." No, you
[1:27:25] are.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Outside of grace, you are condemned.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Unless you're the recipient of grace,
[1:27:33] the receive on the receiving end of
[1:27:35] grace at this moment. Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; We all are condemned.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; There's no one that's righteous. Know
[1:27:42] not one.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; James said, "And whosoever shall keep
[1:27:49] the whole law and yet offend in one
[1:27:52] point, he's guilty of all."
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; I've used this.
[1:27:58] Especially with Seventh Day Adventists.
[1:28:00] And if there's any that will ever
[1:28:02] listen, Seventh Day Adventist, they just
[1:28:04] cut. They cut to the finest line on the
[1:28:07] seventh day. And if you don't keep the
[1:28:09] seventh day, if you don't keep Sabbath,
[1:28:12] if you don't keep Saturday, you are
[1:28:13] condemned. You don't have the
[1:28:15] revelation. I said, "Does the scripture
[1:28:17] not say that he that offends in one
[1:28:22] offends in all?"
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; I said, "Can you tell me that you keep
[1:28:25] all the law?"
[1:28:28] He said, "Well, no." I said, "Then
[1:28:29] you're guilty of it all."
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; There went his argument on the seventh
[1:28:36] day.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; You know, you never want to be found in
[1:28:40] a place where you're only answering
[1:28:42] questions. You got to ask a few. That's
[1:28:44] that's Jesus tactic. They said, "By what
[1:28:47] authority do you do this?" He said,
[1:28:49] "Well, I have a question for you, too."
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; John, was he of man or was he of God?
[1:28:55] And they went into a little huddle. came
[1:28:57] back out said, "We can't answer that."
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's just what I thought.
[1:29:01] Neither can I tell you by what authority
[1:29:03] I do this."
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; He could have told him,
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; but he's just not on the receiving end
[1:29:08] of everybody's questioning.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; You got the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Are you sure that you're a believer?
[1:29:15] Well, you can just say to that doubting
[1:29:17] spirit that comes to you, one thing I do
[1:29:19] know that you are headed for hell.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; You are headed for the flames of hell.
[1:29:25] all that doubt. I know what Christ has
[1:29:27] done through me through grace.
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; I just have to be careful now that I
[1:29:35] don't get evangelistically preaching
[1:29:37] because it'd be so easy at this moment
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; that all the world might become guilty.
[1:29:42] And then James says, "For whosoever, for
[1:29:44] whosoever shall keep the whole law and
[1:29:46] yet offend in one point, he's guilty of
[1:29:48] all." Paul said in Galatians, Christ has
[1:29:52] become of no effect unto you. Whosoever
[1:29:54] you are justified by the law. You're
[1:29:57] fallen from grace. And when I say law,
[1:30:00] don't think about the ten commandments.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Think about the magnified law.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Paul said again in Romans, what shall we
[1:30:10] say then? Is the law sin? God forbid.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; The law wasn't sin. The problem with the
[1:30:16] law was the flesh was too weak and
[1:30:18] couldn't keep it. Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; And God put the law. He put a law so
[1:30:22] structured. He knew before he even had
[1:30:25] Moses up on the mount that nobody could
[1:30:27] keep it.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; He gave the law because they they
[1:30:31] weren't they weren't satisfied with the
[1:30:33] grace that had come to them. Never lose
[1:30:36] sight of the grace that has come to us.
[1:30:39] [Applause]
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; And they lost sight of it. So he sent
[1:30:43] them a law that would condemn them. What
[1:30:45] do we say? Is the law of sin? God
[1:30:46] forbid. Nay, I had not known sin but by
[1:30:51] the law.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Law comes that we will know sin.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And if we know sin, then we feel we're
[1:31:02] then we automatically have a feeling of
[1:31:04] condemnation. I'm condemned because of
[1:31:06] sin. That's how Satan has such an
[1:31:09] advantage. If he can move us off of our
[1:31:11] foundation of grace, he'll move us.
[1:31:14] Because there's no flesh that you
[1:31:15] couldn't even begin to live good enough.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; And if you contribute one iota
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; to Calvary, then it didn't need the
[1:31:24] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Either the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:31:29] cleanseth all sin or cleanses no sin.
[1:31:33] And if you can contribute anything to
[1:31:35] it, then the death of Jesus Christ was
[1:31:38] insufficient within itself. And I say
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; all hail King Jesus.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; I had not known sin but by the law. For
[1:31:51] I had not known lust, except the law had
[1:31:53] said, "Thou shalt not covet." Paul said,
[1:31:56] I had not known lust
[1:31:59] except the law said, "Thou shalt not
[1:32:01] covet." He said in in Galatians, my last
[1:32:04] scripture, wherefore then serveth the
[1:32:06] law? It was added because of
[1:32:08] transgressions. The law was added
[1:32:10] because of transgressions till the seed
[1:32:13] should come to whom the promise was
[1:32:16] made.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Did you earn the promise?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Well, you couldn't do anything for the
[1:32:21] promise. Did you earn something?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Did you earn say God owes me a promise?
[1:32:27] No.
[1:32:28] the law and the transgressions and all
[1:32:30] of that was waiting for the seed to
[1:32:32] come. And when the seed came,
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; then grace was made known to them.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh my goodness. The time is
[1:32:43] slipping away quickly.
[1:32:46] So thus, in order to show the people
[1:32:49] really where they were, God commanded
[1:32:51] Moses to build a tabernacle according to
[1:32:53] the pattern showed him in the mount. So
[1:32:56] now what he did here on earth, he built
[1:32:57] a tabernacle according to the pattern
[1:33:00] that had been showed him on the mount
[1:33:02] because in heaven there also was an
[1:33:04] altar with blood on it
[1:33:07] for our a sacrifice for us.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; I don't understand all of that but we'll
[1:33:12] come to know when we cross over. But
[1:33:14] Moses built a tabernacle.
[1:33:16] Now,
[1:33:18] I started getting into I want you if you
[1:33:21] get tired just, you know, I'll have you
[1:33:24] all stand and turn around for a moment,
[1:33:26] but if you can stay with me, are we all
[1:33:28] right for time?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Now, when when God had Moses make this
[1:33:35] tabernacle
[1:33:37] and someone has said, and I think it's
[1:33:40] worthy of repeating,
[1:33:42] the center of the earth is Israel.
[1:33:45] And the center of Israel
[1:33:47] is the was the temple. And the center of
[1:33:52] the temple is the holy of holies. And
[1:33:56] the center of the holy of holies is the
[1:33:59] ark. And the center of the ark is the
[1:34:02] word. That's the center of all things.
[1:34:10] Now perhaps
[1:34:18] this is the ark just for a moment.
[1:34:23] And the mercy seat, you don't see any
[1:34:25] seat. Those are two cherubams on top
[1:34:28] that are bending with their wings
[1:34:30] touching.
[1:34:32] The mercy seat, what is referred to as
[1:34:34] the mercy seat is actually that slab,
[1:34:36] the lid
[1:34:39] over the
[1:34:41] tablets, the tables of law that were
[1:34:44] inside.
[1:34:46] A noted uh Jewish leader said recently,
[1:34:49] and I thought I would just write it. It
[1:34:51] was so fitting for this morning. This is
[1:34:54] a very learned
[1:34:56] Jewish leader,
[1:34:58] uh, religious man and spiritual in their
[1:35:01] understanding. He said,
[1:35:04] quote, "The tabernacle contained the
[1:35:07] most precious gift the Jews got, the
[1:35:11] tablets handed from God to Moshe or
[1:35:16] Moses."
[1:35:18] Well, I'm not as learned as he is
[1:35:22] and perhaps not quoted like he is, but
[1:35:26] he's making a serious error.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; The two tablets in there condemned him.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; The two tablets in there condemned the
[1:35:36] entire Israel.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; The two tablets in there, according to
[1:35:39] the Apostle Paul, condemned them all.
[1:35:44] What he missed was the mercy seat
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; that was on top.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; It's called a place of propitiation
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; or in the Hebrew a covering
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; because back then God was simply
[1:35:57] covering their sin. Right.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And that the whole thing was ineffective
[1:36:03] unless they slayed an animal and they
[1:36:05] took a basin of blood and once a year
[1:36:07] the high priest went in not only for the
[1:36:10] sins of the people but for his own sin.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; All was condemned.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; There was no good people. You may not
[1:36:19] have been able to lay a finger on that
[1:36:21] high priest's life and I'm sure you
[1:36:23] would not have been able to. But what
[1:36:25] was in that ark condemned him. Amen.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; And he went in according to the
[1:36:32] scripture
[1:36:34] and he sprinkled blood
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; on the mercy seat.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For the people, they weren't
[1:36:42] worthy outside. They weren't
[1:36:44] contributing anything outside. They
[1:36:46] didn't die. An animal died. It wasn't
[1:36:49] their blood. An animal died.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; The They didn't ordain the high priest.
[1:36:54] God ordained the high priest. What was
[1:36:56] it? It was grace, grace, grace all the
[1:37:00] way along. It was grace that was coming
[1:37:02] to them. And they sprinkled blood on the
[1:37:04] mercy seat.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; And Moses and on another occasion
[1:37:10] sprinkled blood on the people.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Wonder what you'd be doing
[1:37:15] if that was taking place this morning
[1:37:17] and actually were sprinkling blood.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; But there was no justification of that
[1:37:23] blood. They were made conscious of the
[1:37:26] sin
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; and the guilt and the and it tells us
[1:37:30] that they came in guilty and went out
[1:37:31] guilty because the scripture tells us
[1:37:34] there was no power in the law or in the
[1:37:36] blood or in the sacrifices to cleanse
[1:37:39] the conscience.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; They went in guilty and came out guilty.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; But we have entered into another veil.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have come before another
[1:37:54] mercy seat where there is no remembrance
[1:37:57] of sin anymore.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; And if there's a remembrance for one
[1:38:05] person, there's a remembrance for all
[1:38:07] people.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; All people.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; And I don't think there's anybody here
[1:38:20] that wants their past.
[1:38:23] dragged up
[1:38:26] then all people
[1:38:31] then there's no forgiveness for all
[1:38:33] people
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; or say well there can be forgiven but
[1:38:36] it's still remembered that's contrary to
[1:38:39] this Bible
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; right
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; so you say well listen close when was
[1:38:48] your past forgiven
[1:38:51] when I got saved. When did you get
[1:38:53] saved? When I repented. Okay.
[1:38:58] And the scripture says that if we sin,
[1:39:01] we have an advocate with the father. Is
[1:39:04] he an effective advocate, ineffective
[1:39:06] advocate? Does the blood still atone or
[1:39:08] doesn't atone? And that person repents.
[1:39:11] Is it for for is it forgiven? And if
[1:39:13] it's forgiven, is it forgotten? Oh, no.
[1:39:16] somehow we can still lay our hands on
[1:39:18] it, then that means that any sin that
[1:39:20] you had before your first repentance,
[1:39:22] that also can be remembered.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And I don't think you want that all
[1:39:27] brought up,
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; But if you touch someone else, if you
[1:39:35] raise yourself up and lift yourself up
[1:39:37] and say, "Well, uh, I see this failing.
[1:39:40] I see this sin in their life."
[1:39:43] If they've repented,
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:46] If there has indeed been a repentance
[1:39:48] and according to the prophet's word and
[1:39:50] it and the ink fell into the blood, the
[1:39:54] bleach and broke it up until even God
[1:39:58] can't find it.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; How many times? Many times that even God
[1:40:06] can't find it.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:14] But Satan would be very ready to anoint
[1:40:16] your memory channel.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; And that's for a for a double reason.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; One is if he can anoint your memory
[1:40:25] channel to your own past, that gives him
[1:40:27] a channel to come in and condemn you.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; And if you live under condemnation,
[1:40:34] you can never be the free person
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; that God intends you to be.
[1:40:50] Are you all right for time?
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm not done.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to Here's a paradox.
[1:41:04] The flesh body of Jesus Christ equated
[1:41:07] to her was equal to
[1:41:10] the very law that you see in that box.
[1:41:13] Having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[1:41:16] even the law of commandments contained
[1:41:19] in ordinances for to make himself of
[1:41:21] twain a new man. So making peace he
[1:41:25] abolished he abolished the enmity and
[1:41:28] even the law of commandments in his
[1:41:31] flesh.
[1:41:33] Now, in the message token, I hope that
[1:41:37] you're able to stay with me because I
[1:41:38] don't want to have to come to it at this
[1:41:40] point again. It's hard to me to break
[1:41:41] into it. All right.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 3 4:30 says, "Grieve not the
[1:41:48] Holy Ghost of God, whereby you are
[1:41:51] sealed until the day of your
[1:41:53] redemption." Not till the next revival,
[1:41:55] not but until the day of redemption. He
[1:41:58] that's born of God does not commit sin.
[1:42:02] Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; The because the seed of God remains in
[1:42:07] him.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; See, it's not that the person because
[1:42:09] I'm going to read another quote says
[1:42:11] that we sin every
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; day,
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; but it's not regarded or attributed to
[1:42:19] the person that has come under the grace
[1:42:21] of God. Just hold it very closely. I
[1:42:24] don't want you to get lopsided on that.
[1:42:26] That's why I took two quotes. Listen to
[1:42:29] them closely. says that does not commit
[1:42:32] sin,
[1:42:34] the seed of God remains in him and he
[1:42:37] cannot sin.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; How can he when the tokens there
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; and the token is only there because God
[1:42:48] showed his grace to that individual.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; So by grace the token rests there.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:43:00] A token. The token is a sign. He's been
[1:43:04] accepted.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; The token is there. And the token is a
[1:43:12] sign. He's been accepted.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Does he fail? Does he make mistakes? Do
[1:43:18] they do wrong? Do they sin? The prophet
[1:43:20] says they do sin
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; in the sense of
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; I'll I'll I'll read it for you. He says
[1:43:29] you if he comes and tries to strike you
[1:43:32] with sickness or something else, he said
[1:43:35] show him your token and prove to him
[1:43:37] that you're a purchased product of God.
[1:43:40] Resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:43:42] you. Hold the token over you unmovable
[1:43:45] in faith, his promised word. Amen.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Now the scripture says 1 John
[1:43:53] 3:9, whosoever is born of God
[1:43:58] does not commit sin. For
[1:44:01] see, it just doesn't say he does not
[1:44:03] commit sin. He says for
[1:44:07] his seed remainth remainth in him. Not
[1:44:12] his seed visits him. His seed remainth
[1:44:15] in him.
[1:44:17] Hallelujah.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; You might say right away, and far be it
[1:44:23] from so, well, brother Ed, are you
[1:44:25] making allowance for sin?
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; No, but what I'm saying to you is under
[1:44:31] maybe not under the law, even though I
[1:44:34] will say there's no one here keeps the
[1:44:36] Ten Commandments.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; So, let's get that out of our mind. And
[1:44:40] for sure when Jesus Christ came and I've
[1:44:43] got to move on quickly to that
[1:44:48] when Jesus Christ came.
[1:44:56] The scripture says that he he was the
[1:44:58] fulfillment of the law. But also now and
[1:45:02] I touch on what I touched on just
[1:45:04] briefly last Sunday. He also increased
[1:45:08] or in intensified or magnified the law.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said grace was before
[1:45:18] law.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; During law
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; and after law
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; grace was before law,
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; during law
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; and after the law.
[1:45:35] Hallelujah.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Are you happy about that?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Now, magnified grace and magnified law.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Listen close. So when the fullness of
[1:45:52] grace came, the fullness of grace came.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; He was full of grace.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible never says of Moses that he
[1:46:01] was full of grace.
[1:46:03] There's no place in the scripture that
[1:46:04] says that the law was full of grace. Now
[1:46:07] the fullness of grace came
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; and watch him magnify. Now the fullness.
[1:46:15] So the grace was magnified.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Are you in agreement?
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Grace was magnified.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; In fact, it's when it's full. There's
[1:46:26] nothing greater than that grace. Yes.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; And now watch and magnify the law.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; It is said, "Thou shalt not commit
[1:46:37] adultery."
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; But I say unto you,
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; "He that lookketh on her, lookth on a
[1:46:45] woman
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; to lust after her, or to have strong
[1:46:48] desires for her, hath
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; committed adultery already in his
[1:46:56] heart." Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; And there's a there's such a tendency to
[1:47:00] kind of lessen that and say, "Well, it
[1:47:02] doesn't, you know, fully mean.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; I I'll tell you how it means it."
[1:47:06] Apostle Paul picks it up and he
[1:47:08] intensifies it.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; He says, "Know ye not that he
[1:47:13] doesn't say a believer, unbeliever,
[1:47:15] anybody else. He that is joined." And he
[1:47:17] took the other extreme. He that is
[1:47:20] joined. This man might be an excellent
[1:47:22] man. This man might be just a excellent
[1:47:25] morally fine man, but he that is joined
[1:47:28] to an harlot
[1:47:30] is one flesh.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; He takes the marriage union words
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; and he's one flesh.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; And in one short phrase,
[1:47:42] the magnified grace
[1:47:46] condemned everybody. Amen.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Condemned all men at least.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; And you know why? Here's one of the
[1:47:56] mysteries that's been revealed.
[1:47:59] And when and and and when the headstone
[1:48:01] came and the mysteries revealed,
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; then we started shouting grace grace. It
[1:48:06] started shoutings amongst us
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; because one of the mysteries was and the
[1:48:11] prophet said
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; he said the law
[1:48:16] can only be the policeman.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Now you can't take a prophet's words and
[1:48:22] adjust it.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; The law can only be a policeman. And the
[1:48:28] policeman can only put you in jail. He
[1:48:32] cannot take you out.
[1:48:34] Amen.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to emphasize that the law
[1:48:38] can't take you out.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Someone says, "Well, you know, I I
[1:48:41] didn't do that. I don't do that." You're
[1:48:43] putting yourself in jail,
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Now, I I speak these things even at the
[1:48:51] expense of being misunderstood because
[1:48:53] it's on the internet and goes
[1:48:54] everywhere.
[1:48:56] This I've only shared with ministers and
[1:48:59] I'm sharing it now with this
[1:49:00] congregation. I've shared this with
[1:49:03] ministers over a period of perhaps 25
[1:49:05] years
[1:49:06] and I found it was such a release when
[1:49:10] they were dealing with things within
[1:49:11] their own congregation.
[1:49:17] You know, friends,
[1:49:19] let's just be honest.
[1:49:21] Let's get to the real world. We're going
[1:49:24] to be faced with
[1:49:27] mixed families,
[1:49:29] difficult. There will be divorce
[1:49:31] situations.
[1:49:33] There will be all kinds of uncleanness.
[1:49:36] There'll be these things until we leave
[1:49:39] here.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; And there are people who are perhaps
[1:49:44] right here. And you may have had
[1:49:47] questions. People who go through the
[1:49:50] most unfortunate and of situations and
[1:49:53] their homes are broken and wives have
[1:49:56] gone or husbands have gone and give
[1:49:58] themselves to the kingdom of Satan and
[1:50:02] then they come and do I have a right to
[1:50:04] marry or whatever more. I'm not I'm not
[1:50:07] that kind of a judge.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then and then you can go to
[1:50:11] the scripture and get all kinds of
[1:50:13] quotes leaning one way or quotes leaning
[1:50:16] the other way. A man can but a woman
[1:50:18] can't and all of these which is exactly
[1:50:21] what the prophet said. And you might
[1:50:23] say, "Well, brother Bisco, we've, you
[1:50:25] know, we haven't said anything, but
[1:50:26] we've observed your motions, your
[1:50:29] movements, your decisions, your we've
[1:50:32] observed it. Maybe we've even questioned
[1:50:33] it, whatever more."
[1:50:36] And what I do
[1:50:38] is I don't go just at what brother
[1:50:40] Brandham said.
[1:50:42] Is that right? No, I don't go just what
[1:50:45] he said because you can fabricate
[1:50:49] and structure things to fit your own
[1:50:51] situation.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; But what I do, I put my back up against
[1:50:55] what brother Brandham did.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is why I have not
[1:51:06] participated
[1:51:08] in marrying divorced people because
[1:51:10] brother Brandham wouldn't even marry his
[1:51:12] own son.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you didn't know that he
[1:51:17] wouldn't marry Billy Paul.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; But
[1:51:22] they had communion together.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; They had footwashing together.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Billy Paul was still with them. There
[1:51:29] wasn't one single there wasn't one
[1:51:32] single moment that he wasn't his son
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; and that he wasn't part of him in his
[1:51:38] ministry.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Billy Paul was still there handing out
[1:51:42] cards. And furthermore, in case you're
[1:51:45] not ready to shout, "Grace, grace," the
[1:51:48] pillar of fire came one day
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; and spoke to Billy's wife Loys.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; The very woman the prophet wouldn't
[1:51:58] marry him to,
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; but the grace of God came and spoke and
[1:52:04] said,
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; "You'll have a child."
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; She kept having miscarriages and losing
[1:52:09] children. You'll have a child.
[1:52:13] something friends. I fully expect to get
[1:52:16] into waters
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; that is swimming waters for you. I fully
[1:52:20] expect to get into things that's causing
[1:52:22] you to think about.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; But it's still there. It's not something
[1:52:26] I studied this last week. I'm now
[1:52:29] pouring out years of myself and I shall
[1:52:32] go into to go and and face and be with
[1:52:35] God this afternoon. I will thank the
[1:52:37] Lord that I was able to deliver my soul.
[1:52:40] Amen.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; What do you think that Sister Loyce, God
[1:52:45] bless her, we've been in her home. She's
[1:52:47] a lovely person.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; What do you think she could say? One
[1:52:51] thing. Grace. Grace unto it.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; We're not here to be the answer for
[1:52:57] everybody's life or everybody's problem.
[1:52:59] But I can tell you one thing. Outside of
[1:53:01] grace, every man is condemned. Amen.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; And so they came to the
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; they came to the mercy seat.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; And the thing that was in there was
[1:53:14] condemning them.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; But the lid that was on it was called
[1:53:19] the mercy seat
[1:53:22] and it had blood sprinkled on it. Now
[1:53:24] friends,
[1:53:27] say
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; sickum.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; All right. Good.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; I'll carry on.
[1:53:33] Now came the fullness of the Godhead
[1:53:37] bodily in a man.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; The fullness of grace, full of grace and
[1:53:42] truth. There was no other grace but his
[1:53:44] grace.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Full of grace and full of truth. And now
[1:53:48] he condemns
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; every man
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; in the country but also in him. And in a
[1:53:55] short time he was hanging on Calvary and
[1:53:58] the blood was spilt. And the prophet of
[1:54:00] God said the mercy seat was in plain
[1:54:04] view.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't see it.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Whether they saw it or not, it was still
[1:54:13] there.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; And there were a few
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; that caught it.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; There are few that saw. He was mercy to
[1:54:21] them. He was grace to them. There was a
[1:54:24] few. There was a handful. And I want to
[1:54:26] believe there's a handful here today.
[1:54:29] Hallelujah.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; What was it? Magnified law and magnified
[1:54:37] grace.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; And having said that, now you can
[1:54:40] understand
[1:54:43] when the group of men came.
[1:54:46] Oh, it's incredible.
[1:54:51] Brother Brandham said, "These Pharisees,
[1:54:53] you couldn't put your finger on their
[1:54:55] life.
[1:54:59] They probably lived better lives than
[1:55:01] most of us
[1:55:04] and they've got stones in their hand
[1:55:07] to fulfill the law of Moses.
[1:55:13] And they said to Jesus,
[1:55:16] "This woman has been caught
[1:55:19] in the very act
[1:55:22] of adultery."
[1:55:25] Moses has said she should be stoned.
[1:55:29] And what do you say?
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; And a lot of people they start getting
[1:55:36] technical about that. Why she said what
[1:55:38] she said or why he said what he said.
[1:55:41] No, I want you to catch the whole
[1:55:43] principle.
[1:55:44] They were trying to justify themselves
[1:55:48] by the policemen.
[1:55:50] And the policeman, a prophet says under
[1:55:53] the unveiled mystery of the headstone at
[1:55:55] this coming time that the policeman can
[1:55:58] only put you back in jail.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; And because they use the policeman,
[1:56:04] Jesus threw them all back in jail.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; He that's without sin cast the first
[1:56:10] stone. He didn't say she didn't commit
[1:56:13] adultery, but she had been brought she
[1:56:15] had been brought. Can you imagine those
[1:56:18] men that were actually condemning her
[1:56:20] brought her to the fountain of grace?
[1:56:28] Oh, I feel like shouting hallelujah.
[1:56:33] I feel like shouting grace, grace unto
[1:56:36] him.
[1:56:39] I feel like shouting. I feel like
[1:56:42] shouting to my Lord Jesus that was
[1:56:43] kneeling there waiting in the sand.
[1:56:46] Grace, grace.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; I'd like to have danced around him and
[1:56:51] said, "Grace, grace."
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; I'd like to have danced around him
[1:56:56] saying, "What grace is this?"
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:07] and her condemnation blew away.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; When grace spoke
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; said, "Neither
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; do I condemn thee."
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you,
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; but that's the treatment I want.
[1:57:30] [Music]
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:34] Hallelujah.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; We're in danger of developing
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; message Pharisees.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Don't ever fall into that trap. Amen.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Well, now we have got the message and
[1:57:49] and but I live according to the message
[1:57:52] and I live I live according just a
[1:57:55] second with every word you're throwing
[1:57:57] yourself back in jail
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; because the message actually that was
[1:58:02] the revealing Luke 17:30 came and
[1:58:05] magnified even the law over what Jesus
[1:58:08] spoke.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Mo Moses said nothing about a man
[1:58:13] looking on a woman.
[1:58:18] Jesus did.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; But when our Lord Jesus in his coming
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; according to Luke 17:30, when Jesus was
[1:58:25] here, he said nothing about how a woman
[1:58:27] dressed. Do you know why the women all
[1:58:30] of that time dressed as women ought to?
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; It wasn't pertinent.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; So, so it's it's the place
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; it's the place the place of mercy. Yeah.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; When that when that uh ark was in the
[1:58:48] tabernacle, it wasn't for the Canaanites
[1:58:50] and the Gegosites and the Hittites and
[1:58:52] all the otherites, it was for Israel.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; There was none of the other nations that
[1:58:58] were recipients of that grace. That
[1:59:01] blood wasn't for the rest of the world.
[1:59:03] That blood was for them.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, this message came
[1:59:09] to you.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; You heard it.
[1:59:14] Grace came to you
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; to speak, neither do I condemn thee.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; What grace is this?
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; So the mercy seat moved. The mercy seat
[1:59:32] moved. Hold that phrase. Keep it. Go
[1:59:34] home with it. The mercy seat moved.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; And when it moved, it was no longer in
[1:59:38] the tabernacle. It was there walking in
[1:59:41] a body of flesh. The mercy seat was
[1:59:43] there with them
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; and a few people saw it and a few people
[1:59:47] got it, but most were condemned by him
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; because the law was magnified.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Do you know why a lot of people don't
[1:59:56] believe the message?
[1:59:58] Do you know why? Cuz I say it's too
[2:00:01] judgmental.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; You've heard it.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; And it is,
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; If you're only going to get the law part
[2:00:11] of it,
[2:00:14] Jesus didn't say anything about how a
[2:00:16] woman dressed.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Now you have the spirit of Elijah
[2:00:21] saying,
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; "You might be as pure as a lily.
[2:00:26] Morally speaking, you might be as pure
[2:00:29] as a lily,
[2:00:32] but if you've dressed so as to cause a
[2:00:35] man to look on you and lust after you,
[2:00:39] you will stand before God as a
[2:00:41] prostitute.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; And I can see well many good ladies
[2:00:48] sitting here saying, "Oh, no. No. I I
[2:00:51] somehow I could never be equated or
[2:00:53] equal to a prostitute."
[2:00:56] Do you know why the Do you know why our
[2:00:57] Lord Jesus Christ said that in this
[2:00:59] generation? So that all would be
[2:01:01] condemned. Jesus in his first coming
[2:01:03] condemned as far as I'm concerned
[2:01:05] condemned all men
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; because the law came to throw everybody
[2:01:10] in jail.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; And and the prophet of God, Jesus Christ
[2:01:14] in his second coming and speaking this
[2:01:16] message to the prophet essentially threw
[2:01:18] all women in jail.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Condemned all.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Why did he say as pure as a lily?
[2:01:26] because they are
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; there was women in front of him while he
[2:01:30] was saying it that was pure as a lily
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; never knew any other man maybe just her
[2:01:36] husband but the apostle Paul says
[2:01:40] he that is joined to an harlot and Jesus
[2:01:44] said if a man looks he's committed it
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; so I hope there isn't anybody here try
[2:01:54] to justify by themselves, by the law, by
[2:01:57] the words of Jesus,
[2:01:59] or by a prophet's message because that
[2:02:04] part came to condemn.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how can that be? I
[2:02:08] thought it came." You have to understand
[2:02:11] the condemnation of this generation
[2:02:13] before you can before you can realize
[2:02:16] and grasp the grace that has come.
[2:02:19] And if we go by the law that Jesus came,
[2:02:22] the magnified law of Jesus over Moses'
[2:02:25] law. And if we go by the double
[2:02:27] compounded law of the prophet's message
[2:02:30] in this day, I can say if anybody tried
[2:02:32] to come and tell me that I'm free, I'm
[2:02:36] pure by those two laws, I would I'm
[2:02:38] sorry, but I would say you're a liar.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; You're not true.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; There is no flesh come justified by that
[2:02:46] law. What is the answer?
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know who he comes, who he'll
[2:02:51] come to, but I can tell you that the
[2:02:53] mercy seat,
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; hold on to it.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; He said when he came and took the book,
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; he left the mercy seat,
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; not a geographical location. And that is
[2:03:07] why he's even asked, "Is there no mercy
[2:03:09] anymore? Can no one be saved?" He says,
[2:03:11] "Oh no, don't think that." Why? It the
[2:03:14] access to the mercy has transferred.
[2:03:17] It's not back on some mountain in a
[2:03:20] wilderness. It's not back in Jerusalem.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; The flesh of Jesus Christ has been
[2:03:26] buried and been raised a new a new
[2:03:28] person because the scripture says we're
[2:03:30] married to him who's raised from the
[2:03:32] dead.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; The mercy seat is found in Christ
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; and Christ is transferred from flesh to
[2:03:40] word.
[2:03:43] [Applause]
[2:03:45] And if this message found its way to
[2:03:48] you,
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; listen friends, listen,
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; I'm getting wore out, but I'm going to
[2:03:52] pursue this.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; He goes to the conception
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; and he's looking at artificial
[2:03:59] insemination. And he says he sees that
[2:04:02] that the sperm from from the animal goes
[2:04:06] to the egg and and and all those germs
[2:04:09] are moving around. He said, "And it hits
[2:04:12] this one and hits that one. And there's
[2:04:13] millions there perhaps. And it hits
[2:04:15] another one, hits another one, maybe
[2:04:17] right far against the wall, it hits one
[2:04:19] seat. It hits one uh germ in that egg
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; and life comes.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; This message came and hit a lot of
[2:04:28] people, friends.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; This message came and hit the eard drums
[2:04:31] of millions of people before it hit
[2:04:34] yours.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; And for somebody, it was for them. for
[2:04:39] the next person. It wasn't.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; But when it came to that elected seed,
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; there was grace.
[2:04:48] I don't care what kind of a life you've
[2:04:50] lived. You might be the best and the
[2:04:54] purest person on the globe and you might
[2:04:57] be the rankest center on earth, but when
[2:05:00] the message came your way, your sins are
[2:05:03] forgotten in the sea of God's
[2:05:05] forgetfulness.
[2:05:08] The mercy seat
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; is in Christ and Christ is the word.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; You say, "Was the law evil then?" No,
[2:05:19] the law is not evil.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Is a compounded law evil? No. The
[2:05:24] compounded law is not evil.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; What does it do for us? It may, if
[2:05:30] you've lived a godly, honorable life,
[2:05:34] it's wonderful.
[2:05:36] Your memor is not chucked full
[2:05:39] of terrible things.
[2:05:42] And those of you that have not been that
[2:05:44] fortunate,
[2:05:46] you may have been living on the streets.
[2:05:49] You may have been as this woman. What
[2:05:50] about the woman at the well?
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; One husband,
[2:05:57] how long she was with him? I don't know.
[2:05:59] Doesn't work. Second husband
[2:06:02] doesn't work. Just imagine the emotional
[2:06:05] upheaval that's going on in her life.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; And three and four
[2:06:11] and five husbands.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Said, "In that thou setest is the
[2:06:17] truth."
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; And the husband and man you have now is
[2:06:22] not your husband.
[2:06:26] Tell her dark eyes like the prophet
[2:06:29] said, her dark eyes flashed.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:33] I know
[2:06:36] I don't know very much.
[2:06:38] I don't know how to pick a husband. I
[2:06:41] don't know how to fix my life.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; But I do know one thing.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; When the Messiah comes,
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; he'll tell us everything.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; He'll solve all my problems when the
[2:06:54] Messiah comes. And there is the fullness
[2:06:56] of grace. I that speak to thee am he.
[2:07:03] And she dropped her water bucket and ran
[2:07:05] into the city and come see a man who
[2:07:08] told me all that ever I did. Is not this
[2:07:11] the Christ?
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; What could she say?
[2:07:18] I'd say two words. Grace.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Grace unto it.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Grace. Grace.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; That's where your past went.
[2:07:30] Amen.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; And if you error, if you fail,
[2:07:36] if you fall,
[2:07:38] I can tell you according to the
[2:07:40] scripture,
[2:07:42] he will never leave you nor forsake you.
[2:07:45] If you are a son of God, the prophet
[2:07:47] said, you will rise up quickly.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; And you'll repent.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; I have two scriptures that I use all the
[2:07:58] time.
[2:07:59] I have people that come and they confess
[2:08:04] I failed God miserably.
[2:08:07] I have fell into sin.
[2:08:12] All right.
[2:08:14] The Bible says
[2:08:16] it is the goodness of God
[2:08:19] that brings a man to repentance
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; or a woman. So right away I I want to
[2:08:28] see if has been repentance. Not not to
[2:08:30] see if they've repented. That's not it.
[2:08:33] I want to see if the goodness of God has
[2:08:36] come to them.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:39] When I perceive that the goodness of God
[2:08:41] has come to them and they have seen the
[2:08:44] error their way and they have repented
[2:08:47] and made a full repentance, then I also
[2:08:51] know that as the scripture has said
[2:08:55] that the and the prophet emphasizes in
[2:08:58] the unveiling of the word
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; that it disintegrates the very substance
[2:09:02] in fact is I'll give you something I
[2:09:04] don't understand.
[2:09:06] He said the ink goes into the bleach
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; and breaks it up.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; And he said quite frankly, you can't
[2:09:14] find it again because it has become
[2:09:16] bleach.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; It has become bleach.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Now, I told you I was going to say some
[2:09:24] very powerful things and I don't mind
[2:09:26] you misunderstanding me. You don't have
[2:09:28] to worry about that. That's what he
[2:09:29] said.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; He said precisely that. It becomes
[2:09:32] bleach.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Say, how can that be? Because in the
[2:09:35] beginning,
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; it was not. So
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; in the beginning,
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; when God thought of you, he didn't think
[2:09:43] of you as a sinner. He didn't think of
[2:09:45] you as a failure. He saw you as a son
[2:09:48] and daughter of God.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; And when a person gets that revelation,
[2:09:54] all they can say with shoutings
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; and crying,
[2:10:00] "Grace, grace unto it. Praise. Amen.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Grace and mercy.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; That's what we need.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother John.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; I know that's what I need.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; I know that's what this congregation
[2:10:24] needs.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; And you'll be able to poke it right back
[2:10:27] at Satan
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; when he brings it to you. Yes.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; And just so you and with this I'm going
[2:10:35] to close.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; He says and uh hear ye him because I've
[2:10:41] been speaking but now I want to give you
[2:10:43] his words for it.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; And hear ye him. He said no flesh can be
[2:10:49] saved keeping the law. The law was only
[2:10:52] a school master. The law didn't have any
[2:10:55] remedy.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; The law was the prison house. And you
[2:10:58] might say, "Well, that was he's
[2:10:59] referring to the law of Moses." Don't
[2:11:00] interpret it. Let him interpret his own
[2:11:03] saying.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; He says, "The law was God's policeman
[2:11:08] that put you in jail, but it had no
[2:11:11] remedy to bring you out. The law does
[2:11:14] not does not bring you out."
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; That is so it would stop every mouth
[2:11:20] from saying, "Well, I was not guilty of
[2:11:23] that." You're guilty of it all.
[2:11:29] Amen.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; According to the law of Moses,
[2:11:34] perhaps there's a large number here are
[2:11:37] not adulterers or adulteresses. You
[2:11:40] might say that's very strong language.
[2:11:42] That's correct. But according to the law
[2:11:45] of Jesus, the magnified law of Jesus and
[2:11:48] the double magnified law,
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; there's nobody here.
[2:11:55] Nobody here is justified by that.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; We all are condemned and we're worthy of
[2:12:01] death.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; But grace,
[2:12:08] grace is not a light word, friends.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Grace could only come in the unfolding
[2:12:13] of the headstone. Amen.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; To quell the flames
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; of this generation.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Vile generation.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Wicked and evil. Unclean generation.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; The shopping malls are unclean. The
[2:12:31] streets are unclean. The schools are
[2:12:33] unclean. The churches are unclean. It's
[2:12:36] an unclean generation. And except it was
[2:12:39] for the but for the grace of God that
[2:12:41] says I'll send you Elijah the prophet.
[2:12:43] One man
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; in the hand of God
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; with the word in his mouth.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Which spoke grace grace to the elected
[2:12:55] people.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not even dealing with anyone else.
[2:13:00] I'm talking about the elected
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; the predestinated
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; and they will see that grace has come to
[2:13:07] them. Yes.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Let me just finish this. I'm trying I'm
[2:13:10] trying to close
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; in law or grace. Said back in the time
[2:13:19] that God sent down the law, that was
[2:13:22] added to show that these things were
[2:13:25] sin. But now the law couldn't take away
[2:13:28] sin. It only magnified sin. So there was
[2:13:33] a time when there was there was no law.
[2:13:37] He said if there's no law, you can go 90
[2:13:39] m an hour down the street cuz there's no
[2:13:41] law. But soon as there's a law that says
[2:13:44] it's 30, you're condemned.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; And you feel the guilt when you go 50.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; And that's why you look in the mirror to
[2:13:53] see if there's a red light coming.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; If there was no law, then you live every
[2:14:03] man lived by his conscience. But then
[2:14:05] the law come he said to make
[2:14:08] that magnified sin. But in the baptism
[2:14:11] of the of of the baptism of the Holy
[2:14:14] Spirit.
[2:14:16] Just give me five minutes. I got to
[2:14:17] close. He says how horrible sin was. How
[2:14:22] horrible. Not was but what it is now.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; And if that was under the law and Christ
[2:14:29] came to magnify that law. Catch it now.
[2:14:33] Don't let your mind be weird. Christ
[2:14:34] came to magnify that law.
[2:14:38] And he said, "You've heard them say of
[2:14:41] old times, thou shalt not kill. But I
[2:14:44] say unto you, whosoever is angry with
[2:14:46] his brother without a cause is killed
[2:14:48] already."
[2:14:50] [Music]
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "Magnified it."
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; You've heard them say them of old times,
[2:14:59] "Thou shalt not commit adultery." That
[2:15:01] was the act he said.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:04] But I say unto you, whosoever lookth on
[2:15:07] a woman to lust after or her has
[2:15:09] committed adultery, magnified it a
[2:15:12] thousand times.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me it wasn't the act.
[2:15:18] Don't try to escape under the line by
[2:15:20] saying it wasn't the act.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul said it was the act.
[2:15:25] According to the word of Jesus,
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; if you look on a woman, it says he
[2:15:29] didn't say it's like committing
[2:15:31] adultery. It is committing adultery.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; And then the prophet goes on to say,
[2:15:38] well, he said, if it taken 14
[2:15:40] generations, now he's not only he's not
[2:15:42] talking about adultery at all. He's
[2:15:44] actually talking about children that
[2:15:46] were children that were conceived prior
[2:15:48] to marriage.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Well, if it's taken 14 generations for
[2:15:53] that to fade out, what he says, what
[2:15:56] went magnifying glass of God's throat on
[2:15:59] it?
[2:16:07] Brother Brandham's asked a question.
[2:16:12] You've never heard me speak of this
[2:16:13] subject like this.
[2:16:16] He's asked a question, "What about
[2:16:17] children
[2:16:19] that are born outside of wedlock?
[2:16:24] Can they go in the rapture?"
[2:16:26] And he starts a paragraph and he says,
[2:16:28] "Well, being being saved, uh, you know,
[2:16:32] I see that about being in the rapture. I
[2:16:35] I don't see how one could be in the
[2:16:38] rapture." And he goes on like that. Then
[2:16:41] he comes and he turns the subject and
[2:16:45] comes to the under the blood of bulls
[2:16:47] and goats. That wasn't possible. went on
[2:16:51] for generations and generations and 14
[2:16:54] generations.
[2:16:56] But he says, "But now under the blood
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ," that's different.
[2:17:05] [Applause]
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; I've had them in my office.
[2:17:11] I've sat with them when they wrenched
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; inside
[2:17:17] said I've had people tell me or I've had
[2:17:19] those and I've seen it you know in the
[2:17:22] message and has spoken and brother
[2:17:23] Brandham says this that 14 generations
[2:17:25] and can I be redeemed
[2:17:29] and I go to that one line
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; but under the blood
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ it's different
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; why
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; because that's The blood that takes it
[2:17:42] back. That's the bleach, my brother, my
[2:17:44] sister.
[2:17:46] [Music]
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; That's the bleach.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; The sin hit the bleach. Amen.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; And every predestinated son and daughter
[2:17:58] of God will stand redeemed before God
[2:18:01] because the grace of God was before any
[2:18:05] law
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; and it is during the law and it is after
[2:18:11] the law.
[2:18:14] [Music]
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:18] Hallelujah.
[2:18:24] [Music]
[2:18:29] Glory.
[2:18:31] Glory to God.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; I want to say because my time has run
[2:18:38] out and I promised I would close.
[2:18:41] I want to say to you as believers and
[2:18:43] this is not a light statement.
[2:18:46] The mercy seat has moved. Amen.
[2:18:49] This mercy seat that you see
[2:18:52] is not given to everyone.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Don't start asking, well, why? Well,
[2:18:58] then how will those in Mongolia or how
[2:19:00] those those are that's that's God's
[2:19:03] creation.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; That's his business.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; What about the good people amongst the
[2:19:07] Canaanites and the Gersites and all the
[2:19:10] Gegosites and all the otherites? What
[2:19:12] about them? That's none of our business.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; God brought them on the scene. God knows
[2:19:17] what to do with them. And God knows what
[2:19:19] level of grace or mercy he extends to
[2:19:22] people. That's not our business. But our
[2:19:24] business is very clear. The mercy seat
[2:19:27] has come into full view
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; and grace, abundant grace, grace, grace.
[2:19:35] and with the coming of the headstone.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet ties the
[2:19:39] ministry of the seventh angel to it
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; because the ministry of the seventh
[2:19:44] angel was restoring the faith of the
[2:19:46] children back to the fathers.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; He said, in other words, rebuilding the
[2:19:51] temple. What temple? This temple.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; He said, where's the mercy seat now?
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; It's in your heart.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; It's in your heart.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; It's in your heart.
[2:20:04] And that ark that I showed you as a
[2:20:07] table in a a a box,
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; it was not sufficient by itself. It had
[2:20:12] to have blood in it. So the mercy seat
[2:20:15] is in your heart. And the bleeding word
[2:20:18] came
[2:20:20] to that ark.
[2:20:25] [Applause]
[2:20:28] And when the blood
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; of the spotless son of God
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; came to the mercy seat in your heart,
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; there was not even a remembrance
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; of your sin.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; God saw you as you're going to be.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; In his kingdom.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:51] There ought to be a lot of people are
[2:20:52] prepared to stand up for shoutings and
[2:20:55] cryings. Grace, grace unto it.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; I say crimes, grace, grace,
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; grace. Greater
[2:21:07] [Applause]
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; marvelous grace.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel like shouting hallelujah.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:23] [Applause]
[2:21:25] He's worthy of more breath than you've
[2:21:27] got.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of more praise than you
[2:21:30] could give him.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:41] [Music]
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise your name.
[2:21:47] Glory be to you. Oh,
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; don't let them miss it.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Don't let the people miss it.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Like the woman the prophet is speaking
[2:22:03] to. And here the angel of the Lord is
[2:22:05] right there hovering right over her to
[2:22:08] reveal what her need was.
[2:22:11] And he says, "Oh, I hope she doesn't
[2:22:12] miss it.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; I praise your word went out today, Lord.
[2:22:17] things that you've laid so heavily upon
[2:22:19] my heart. Don't let anyone on the
[2:22:21] internet or on the telephone or in the
[2:22:24] in the fellowship room or in the in the
[2:22:26] nursery or here in the sanctuary. Don't
[2:22:28] let anybody miss it. Oh God, is my
[2:22:30] prayer.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; May they to receive it to themselves and
[2:22:34] say, "Oh, oh gracious God, merciful one,
[2:22:40] come, I pray, and renew a right spirit
[2:22:43] within me.
[2:22:45] Cause me, oh God, to know the depths of
[2:22:48] your love and the depths of your grace,
[2:22:52] Jesus.
[2:22:54] Jesus,
[2:22:55] how I personally have prayed of late
[2:23:00] with such a deep desire. I'd like to be
[2:23:02] like you,
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Lord. Just to be like you,
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; to speak like you and to act like you
[2:23:11] and to respond like you.
[2:23:15] Forgive us, Lord.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Forgive me.
[2:23:19] We're coming to communion tonight.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. Oh, God.
[2:23:25] Forgive this congregation. I pray on
[2:23:27] behalf as the pastor of these people, a
[2:23:30] shepherd or a watchman. I pray, oh God,
[2:23:33] that each one will come to that
[2:23:37] beautiful and glorious realization. I'm
[2:23:40] free now. I am free. I can shout
[2:23:43] hallelujah.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord Jesus is exalted
[2:23:54] amongst his people.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord Jesus is to be
[2:23:58] exalted.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Lift him up all ye people.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Give glory to him who has redeemed you.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; The grace of God has sent us a way of
[2:24:10] escape. The way of God, the grace of God
[2:24:12] has sent us a covenant. The way, the
[2:24:15] grace of God has sent us a revelation.
[2:24:18] The grace of God has opened up the seals
[2:24:20] to us.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:24:24] [Music]
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; What shall we do with this grace?
[2:24:34] [Music]
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; He shall bring the headstone. He shall
[2:24:38] bring forth the headstone.
[2:24:40] with shoutings,
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; crying,
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; grace, grace unto it.
[2:24:47] [Music]
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:24:55] Oh God. Oh God.
[2:25:01] Do you remember the words?
[2:25:06] [Music]
[2:25:28] or you go and get this, brother.
[2:25:31] Brother Jess, my wife has the Lord right
[2:25:34] behind you.
[2:25:35] [Music]
[2:25:40] We have to sing this.
[2:25:44] Brother Jess
[2:25:46] to take a microphone to my wife.
[2:25:51] [Music]
[2:25:55] Pray for my wife. She doesn't want to
[2:25:57] sing.
[2:25:59] And sometimes she remembers all the
[2:26:02] words and I need her to sing for me.
[2:26:07] Can you I'm going to give you a
[2:26:09] microphone there
[2:26:11] and give her lots of power
[2:26:20] [Music]

[2:26:27] words? Why don't you just come here and
[2:26:29] stand here?

[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Do you see?
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; What is this first word?
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Lost in my
[2:26:45] second. Listen to these words.
[2:26:49] Lost in my sin. Yes.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Banished from God,
[2:26:56] knowing not of his grace,
[2:27:00] seeking by merit to gain my salvation,
[2:27:04] ever despairing
[2:27:07] of of winning the race.
[2:27:10] Oh,
[2:27:13] how I
[2:27:16] gasped in in God's offer of mercy. Now I
[2:27:21] can sing. Now I am saved.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to the words.
[2:27:26] [Music]
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Lost in my sin.
[2:27:33] In the darkness I wondered.
[2:27:38] banished from God,
[2:27:41] knowing not of his grace,
[2:27:45] [Music]
[2:27:46] seeking by merit
[2:27:49] to gain my salvation,
[2:27:55] ever despairing
[2:27:58] of winning
[2:28:00] the race.
[2:28:04] Oh, now I am saved.
[2:28:08] I can shout
[2:28:11] halleluah.
[2:28:15] Saved from my sin
[2:28:18] and my darkness made bright.
[2:28:23] No more in sin
[2:28:26] and in darkness
[2:28:29] I wonder.
[2:28:32] Jesus
[2:28:34] has banished
[2:28:37] my gloom
[2:28:39] and my night.
[2:28:42] Second verse.
[2:28:44] Oh, how I grasped at God's offer
[2:28:49] of mercy
[2:28:52] when by his grace
[2:28:55] he revealed it to me,
[2:28:59] [Music]
[2:29:00] showing me Christ
[2:29:03] who had purchased
[2:29:05] my pardon
[2:29:09] when for my sin
[2:29:11] he was judged. on the tree.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; He was judged.
[2:29:18] Now,

[2:29:33] and my pathway
[2:29:35] made bright.
[2:29:39] No more in darkness
[2:29:42] or fear shall I wonder.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:29:50] has
[2:29:53] my gloom
[2:29:55] and my
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; try and sing it. Now I'm saved. That's
[2:29:59] what I've been saying through the whole
[2:30:01] service. That was my phrase from this
[2:30:03] song. I just had to have it. Now I am
[2:30:07] saved.
[2:30:10] I can shout
[2:30:12] hallelujah
[2:30:15] [Music]
[2:30:17] from my sin
[2:30:20] and my pathway
[2:30:23] made bright.
[2:30:27] No more in darkness
[2:30:30] or fear
[2:30:32] shall I wonder.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; Lift it up to him. Jesus
[2:30:39] has
[2:30:41] my gloom and my life.

[2:30:49] Christ.

[2:31:33] God has come to you.
