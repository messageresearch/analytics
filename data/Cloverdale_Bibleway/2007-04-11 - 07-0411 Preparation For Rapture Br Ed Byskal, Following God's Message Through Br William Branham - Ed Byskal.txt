your amen get some power power power amen well good evening God bless you thank you for your prayers thank you for your thoughts we uh were gone very short time went Thursday to Ottawa meetings were Friday Saturday and Sunday and uh came back early Monday morning so uh I just thought I would just give you greetings from Brother Mundo and the uh church and the people that gathered there um I didn't have really opportunity to tell you but Saturday Sunday night rather uh there was a message on our phone which we didn't get until uh Monday morning and we're leaving out Thursday and the message was that there brother Mundo on the phone and he was just devastated he said I'm devastated I don't know what to say I uh he said we we can't have the building won't be ready for the dedication and our contractor tells us it'll be two weeks and he said I'm just so humiliated I'm so uh heart sick over this and so I then I tried to call him for about an hour I wasn't able to get him on the phone and then uh then he called here to the church office and and I uh got the message got the call I should say and spoke with him and he said some of the brothers some of the other pastor PS from Quebec and and Ontario had been in touch with him and said building or no building it's the word that's important and we're not we're not gathering for a building we're gathering for the word so we want to go ahead with the meetings anyway uh so he said please you know just just come so that's what we did and they had gotten the convention center of travel large Convention Center downtown Ottawa and uh probably somewhere between 350 and 400 people gathered and quite a few ministers quite a few pastors from quite a number of places and uh one friend of brother Mundo who's a doctor from Chicago came but brother uh Fernand feay from Pastor from Quebec City brother Andre PTI who many of you know from the other side of Montreal brother Jano from Montreal and then people from petroia and Toronto and all over different places in Ontario and I certainly didn't get to meet all of them but there was a real real wonderful Gathering of people and they certainly were uh no pulling on the word they just were not interested in uh getting away too quickly so we had a wonderful time and uh just to be a real encouragement to them I had an opportunity to see the uh church that they're building and really uh outstanding God did marvelous things for this not a large group of people people probably 60 maybe 60 60 to 80 people that are actually in that congregation but they have uh they've constructed a very very nice building and people uh people who are not Believers have just taken them into their heart uh the city of Ottawa which is a city of about a million people I'm told uh they told him the city hall told him that his application for construction of that church had had gone through the city hall the fastest of any application that's ever been in the city hall and so they were able to do it in just a matter of a few short months and it really really is marvelous and and uh the the lawyers and the builders and everyone who has uh been part of putting this building up for them just seem to take them into their hearts and said you know you must uh you must go ahead with this and and at all uh with all speed and so they helped them in every way possible and did what I would say the uh extraordinary I mean more than I would say publicly just went way the Second Mile and it was just like as though you have to do it even when they felt they can't do it he said you must do it this what our finances don't allow and I understand well I guess they won't mind if I say this but he said well we just can't afford it and their own lawyer just unbelieving lawyer says well here he says I'll write out a check write out a check and very sizable check not as a gift he said just you know you'll pay me back at some time but this has to go ahead and so when he saw that happening he said I guess it does have to go ahead we just can't stop and so they saw God behind it over and over and over again and uh that was really wonderful uh so we're really thankful we Rejoice with them and and God was very gracious to us we're happy to be home of course always nice to be home uh I'm going to have you stand if you would please and we're going to just have a word of prayer and I'll turn to the scriptures right away I think that's all we'll need in the way of singing amen we're always ready for the word are we not Allelujah let's have a word of prayer father just so good it feels so comfortable not only to be with your people but to be in your presence and to know that these people have gathered they've gathered for one purpose that we might Fellowship around the body

Sheep feed may may there be Cool Waters to drink for the thirstday may we be refreshed in your presence oh God I pray that Satan will be driven far from the camp Oh God and may may our may we just be at at at comfort and at peace and and uh Lord as we Fellowship around the word tonight anoint us oh God each one me to speak and the people to hear and we just thank you for everyone that's within our

get accustomed to this brother Jack aguer I saw it on the all right all right nice to see brother Jack andery here and understand he'd moved we we saw on the streaming and your mother was here and brother Phil and we're happy for that may God bless you in your decision amen I'll have you turn to Luke the 22nd chapter and we're going to begin to read at verse 7 and the service tonight I trust the Lord will just help us to be in the direct preparation for Sunday and I'm going to speak tonight on Preparation PR preparation for Rapture so we've been speaking on anointed for Rapture now preparation for Rapture and uh I just trust the Lord will there's just been some things moving in my heart and I would like to kind of Make Way for for Sunday morning as well uh we'll start at verse 7 of chapter 22 of Luke then came the day of UN leaven bread when the Passover must be killed and he sent Peter and John saying go and prepare us the Passover that we may eat and they said unto him where wilt thou that we prepare and he said unto them behold when you are entered into the city there shall a man meet you bearing a picture of water follow him into the house where he entereth in and used to say unto the man un the Goodman of the house the master SI unto thee where is the guest chamber where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples and he shall show you a large upper room furnished there make ready and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the Passover and when the hour was come he sat down and the TW Apostles with him and he said unto them with desire have I desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say unto you I will not anym eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves for I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come I'll I'll I have another reading but I will uh read it a little bit later you can open your bibles if you would to 1st Samuel the 7th chapter maybe I will just go ahead and read it and then I'll make I'll refer back to it then 7eventh chapter and the third verse and Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel saying if you do return unto the Lord with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and ashteroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines God bless you as you have your seats our first scripture reading uh in Luke Jesus telling the disciples to go and prepare the p Passover now uh you must remember that Jesus had he he had the Bible says as was his custom he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath as was his custom Jesus kept all the uh all the law of the Old Testament not living by the law but he kept the law if you understand what I mean he fulfilled the law and so the Bible tells us that he went and that that was in Luke the 4th chapter he went to the uh synagogue as was his custom and so I would like to just say to you without any hesitation this was not Jesus this was not his first Passover he had the Passover he was brought up as a child he was to the Passover every year he knew what the Passover was and uh uh and and so the disciples and no doubt he had the Passover with the disciples they had had because it was an annual Feast to keep the Passover so they knew well what this was all about this is nothing strange but now this Passover is different this Passover is the culmination of Prophecies of types and shadows from the Old Testament all in a one great climax coming because this now would be the Fulfillment of all of those that have been spoken coming right down to this moment and so Jesus said with desire have I desired to have this Passover with you and he and he told the disciples you'll go and you'll go and you'll see this man and you'll follow him and he'll show you uh you'll come to the Goodman of the house and he'll show you an upper chamber Etc and there you will prepare the Passover they always prepared the Passover but this was a very sign significant and very special Passover that they were preparing the disciples I will say and I'm going a wee bit out on a limb but I would say the disciples did not know that this would be their last one with their lord they did not know he knew but he did not tell them this is the last passover I'll have with you but he did say uh he he said to them um he took the cup and gave thanks and divided among yourself I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come no doubt this was all just mysterious language to them but they did not know this is their last passover this was different and they might have approached it differently because the Bible says even at the when Jesus began to say that one of you will betray me and they're discussing who's going to betray right in the same phrase then they get into St amongst themselves who's the greatest now I don't think they would have been in that kind of a mindset if they'd known this is the last one after this after this our Lord is going to be mutilated in within hours he's going to be stripped naked within just hours he's going to be taken from us and uh it would have been different with them but now I want to speak about this preparation uh uh for for the Rapture because I have felt and I don't know how many I'm speaking to but I have felt that there's been something different that God is doing amongst us and I want to come directly to that there may be a lot of people that don't sense it don't feel it I think that perhaps I should feel it maybe before anyone but I've sensed it in the word I've sensed it the way God is dealing in the message I I see it in the in the conversation of uh of others I I see it's it's like a fresh breeze it's like a fresh stirring and I believe that before we can really benefit from that that there needs to be a a self-examination not a Critical examination but a self-examination within ourselves and and and a searching of our hearts and a searching to what God has in mind why are you moving this way why are you stirring this way if you feel that stirring and I do know that many of you have spoken and and not not just with the services that I've spoken the services that other bre ministering Brethren have spoken and there's been things that have been said that have struck you very very deep moved you you very deep and you've written notes and you've called on the phone and you've left voicemail and uh and all kinds of all kinds of messages to let let me know that there's something very deep that God is doing within your life and and and stirring your heart and I believe that we need to capitalize on that I don't believe we should just and that's what my message is today and will continue on Sunday I don't believe we ought to just sit back and take church service as we always took a church service uh uh live our life like we always lived our life uh I think we ought to say God what would you have me to do uh reexamine what what what do you want me to do do I need to rearrange things are there things that I need to actually physically do now when Samuel when he came to this statement that he made there a little bit of a background uh to this phrase to this scripture rather that I read and I just want to give you the background Israel even though they were God's people even though they're God's people and even though we're God's people you can be their elect your elect didn't mean that they were immune to problems didn't immun didn't mean that they're immune to come even coming into captivity and doing wrong and and so the time that uh you remember when Samuel was just a young boy and he came and I want you young people especially I'm going to I'm going to on Sunday I'm going to be speaking Lord willing regarding Josiah and a very young man came to the throne at 8 years old and at when in his 16th year when he was just 16 years old he just did some I don't want to even get into it but he he was a phenomenal young man and had a great heart for God and so that's that's why his his heart was certainly prepared to serve God but now Eli had become an aged man Samuel had just come in and was left by his mother in the temple to serve God God made himself known to Samuel told Eli that the end of his ministry essentially was at hand and as we move through and I don't know how many years actually I didn't go to research at all how many years actually went by but then Israel came into a came into a war with the Philistines and the Philistines came against them and had a great Slaughter the Bible says 30,000 footmen died in that battle 30,000 men of Israel of God's people now you can imagine what they're thinking at this time and the two sons of Samuel are slain because they had also they were they were Wicked and they were both slain and the Ark of God was taken a man escaped and ran back and told the people in the in the city that what had happened there's been a terrible Slaughter the ark has been taken the two sons of Eli have been killed and then Eli hears the turmoil and says what's happening and the messenger comes and tells him Eli is 98 years old and he's a very heavy man and he fell over backwards and broke his neck and so he died this all happened in the same time and one of his sons finen house finen house I guess it is his wife was just giving birth to a child and she gave birth to this child at the news of hearing the Ark of God had been taken now now you know she was not so the grief that struck Eli and the grief that struck her was not that her son her husband was killed so much but it was that the ark was gone you know and that that should that should say something to us the glory of God when that departs if if if that departs from the congregation here where you gather then you want to be wor worried more more than if your loved one dies more than if your loved one dies and his her husband had been killed and she gave birth to this child and they told her to Rejoice or you know be be happy you've born a son and she said she said his name shall be ikabod the glory of the Lord hath Departed so all of this had transpired and Israel now the Ark of the word of God had gone now into the hands of the Philistines and it had been there a long time it actually was put in another uh man's house and he was kind of caretaker of it and the Bible says the Bible said that the the the the people had been Lament in they had lamented they you know what it means to L lament to to cry out to grieve and they had been lamenting the fact that the ark was in the hands and was not where it should be under the control and they were under control of the Philistines and the Bible says for a very long time for 20 years and now we come and they've come to and Samuel says because they've lamented this and they've been in such grief and and and sorrow and so Samuel spake unto the house of Israel saying if you do return to the Lord with all your hearts and then put away the strange gods of asteroth from among you now I want to just bring something very very curious to our minds tonight into your mind something that can prick our conscience what were these elected people of God what was Israel doing lamenting and groaning and and uh grieving over the fact the ark is gone the glory of the Lord's departed and still have asaroth there and still have other gods in their house what are those Gods doing in their house when they've already recognized the glories de parted the glory of God is Not on Israel the ark isn't even here the word isn't here and and and with all of that still they have these Gods a lot of people don't start examining themselves until Trouble Comes and that is really a sad thing I I don't have the same confidence I've prayed for a lot of people that have been in a dying condition or or when they hear that uh something terminal has come their way and then they want to turn to God or or or disaster strikes the family or something has happened an accident something happens suddenly uh you know I'm going to lose my child going to lose my wife going to lose my husband or something and now I really want to get desperate with God what and they want to start examining themselves and cleaning things up why don't they do that ahead of time can you say Amen ahead of time why do we check out our heart ahead of time and he said if you will take these strange gods and ASO from among you and prepare your hearts to serve the Lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines to prepare is to be firm and stable to prepare your heart is not you know not to come to church and listen I don't want to belittle what we do here but to prepare your your heart for God isn't coming to the church and just having an extra special service it has nothing to do with just Clapping Your Hands has nothing to do with waving your hands it has something to do with actually physically doing something you examine your agenda you say I'm far too busy I don't have prayer time I don't have time with the word I don't have time to worship God uh Satan is encroaching on my life and I've got to make some changes actually make some changes to prepar is to be firm and to be stable to be established and to be ready and to arrange now this is my question to you and I I mentioned I mentioned what uh daddy Seymour who was the black brother who was the pastor of ruza Street I just mentioned it here casually when he saw that the Holy Spirit was falling on people and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in unknown tongues and he had not received it he began to pray and they said in this book what I'm reading that he set himself aside and prayed for five hours a day now you may not have that I'm just saying what he did not bringing a condemnation on you because you don't I don't have five hours a day set aside praying but he had five hours a day just set aside and prayed and when I read that and and and as God was dealing with me and I was thinking about the stirring that has taking place I'm feeling that stirring I'm saying Lord what are you wanting to say to us what are you wanting to do in our church church and I don't believe it's just to you know just to come and do exactly the same that we always did I believe God can take control of a service I believe that Supernatural things uh and so then it just struck me and I thought if that man did that and rearranged his life rearranged his schedule and put so much importance on receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit what should we be doing if we actually believe that we're on the very that we are the people to enter into the Rapture what kind of preparation should you and I be making if we actually believe that we're a Rapture crowd and I think if that was superimposed on your mind every single person here young and old a Rapture may take place at any time at any moment just at what state do you want to be in when that happens and that's the state you want to live from morning till night all your waking time preparation for Rapture and he said uh Samuel said to the people that you'll prepare your hearts now I always hesitate if I feel any uh little illness or something that comes by I don't always like to mention it because I have a a whole Myriad of of remedies that are brought to me sometimes they're on my steps my porch at the house and I get them and I have all kind you you need this you need this kind of thing you need that kind of thing and so that's why I said one time here not long ago thank you I'm taking them all and I sure HED there wasn't anything to fight with the other the other substance that I was taking if there was any substance abuse I was I could have been I could have been charged because I was taking it all this got to be good this people took a glug glug these pills that's got to be good I mean I was vitamed there isn't such a word there is now but some of these they said you know what you need to get all that poison out of your system you need this cleansing you need this cleansing stuff and I tell you some of that just stuff is vile it's just Wicked and you I said no I don't feel that bad inside I just can't feel that bad but when I think people are so obsessed and just cleansing themselves and getting all the poison out and just feel it coming out of their pores and my they're getting so healthy I got thinking that really what Samuel was saying get all this out of your heart get all this poison out of your heart get all these ill desires out of your heart get all this uh false worship out of your heart get it all out of your heart cleanse it and prepare yourself that's establish yourself stay with it it's not a flash in a pan we have it today and then we forget about it tomorrow and oh I'm going to get real spiritual now and oh really serve God and then two weeks down the road forgot what we even said no I think we ought to stay with our vow stay with our change our course and stay with it can you say Amen an internal cleansing washing is needed I really believe that I say that for myself for my my home my wife my family because we're speaking about it between ourselves my wife and I have had a lot of conversation and I just think that you know we want to be responsive to the spirit of God now the Rapture just for a moment Jesus was on Mount Transfiguration the disciples sought and he spoke about the place we're going to the Apostle Paul the first church age messenger he said he'd been there been up to the third heaven he saw things that was not legal not possible to describe our messenger brother brandham went beyond the curtain of time describes it in quite detail and you can read it and I think if you haven't read it it's incumbent upon you to read it because I don't see you know I I just don't see how a person can really prepare themselves become serious with something if we're not serious enough to say well that's that's where I'm going you know soon as I soon as I find an that I'm going to take a a certain journey to a certain place I try to find out I try to find out what kind of weather is going to be there because I want to know what we're going to wear I want to try to find out what kind of accommodation is there I want to find out what kind of uh you know roads or who's going to pick us up or I want to have those things in place because I I just shouldn't have less surprises than more and I'm going to come back to that in just a moment but to have Jesus to speak about it the Apostle Paul to speak about it and then the messenger to this hour and God you know this was one of the things brother Brandon referred back to beyond the curtain of time and he speaks about uh I was reading today and I'm just I'm I'm wanting to be a little bit careful because I don't want to crowd in on on Sunday service but he was speaking about just when his wife passed away and there was his little girl Sharon Rose deporting and he just he just beside himself and he said actually he said that it was his Gethsemane he was being tore to Pieces inside he was going through a Gethsemane and calling out to God and Satan standing right there and said you've prayed and now now where's your prayers now where is he when youve prayed now you're calling on him you're asking him you're pleading with him not to take your baby and he won't hear hear you now where is your God and he said he went through his Geth samon and he laid his hand on a little one and said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away but blessed be the name of the Lord you see sometimes in life we're not we're not really prepared to to go through those things but my point now is that I don't believe that we should suddenly get sincere when something like that happened he had already committed himself he already was on course and he was going to go through with it even if Satan met him right in his Gethsemane nothing's going to change because this is way I have set my sails I've set my course and this is the direction I'm going Paul said these words he said to Timothy for I'm now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course and I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give give me at that day and not only not not to me only but unto them all them who also love his appearing mighty departure I'm I'm I'm getting ready to depart he's saying and this departure he's being loosed this departure it's he said it's like in the Greek it's like a ship being loosed from its Moorings the ropes have been let go and it's it can it can go onto its it can go uh it can go now on its Journey it also is not only to be un loosed but to depart from life or or to to be released from bonds but this is what I really like it is to dismiss laws to be loosed to be dismissed our Rapture is where the laws of gravity will lose their hold our Rapture is where the laws of mortality will lose their grip our Rapture is where the things that we so contend with will be gone our rapture is where Satan's death Reigns in these bodies but our Rapture is where the law of death will cease to exist and there'll be it'll have no power it'll have no hold upon us anymore and we are so gripped by so many laws today and those laws will be broken in other words our Rapture is the dismissing of those laws and when I see the greatness of this event I just think and I want to say to you honestly I just think that myself and we all should look on it much more seriously and when you hear when you hear the message and you and you hear that discernment or that more than discernment you hear the word revealing the secret of the heart and remember I've spoken here in the last few weeks that is the sign of the Resurrection we have had in this generation the sign of the Resurrection C and when that happens don't get taken up with brother Brown calling a certain person by name etc etc I heard one today and and I I just marvel at it but all the time every time I hear it I say the sign of the Resurrection God is showing I don't know what it means to other people but he's showing me the sign of the resurrection and if a soul with such a a a special and so potent and so powerfully Vindicated this voice by the sign of the resurrection and the sign of the Messiah it should have a great deal of significance to us to a people that us are are believing it a great deal of significance we say the sign of the Resurrection The Sign of the Resurrection has been here for all these years now and the sign of the Resurrection this Christ has has spoken has spoken so clearly there shouldn't be any mistake there shouldn't be any restraint on our part to believe it and he said if you believe it you do it scripture says for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made us free from the law of sin and death so I asked the question what preparation should we be making for our departure you might say what happens if it doesn't then what happens if it doesn't happen let me tell you you didn't waste your time let me tell you you'll never regret what you did someone might say well we should take an examination of ourselves and uh we can look at our wardrobe and watch how we dress and watch how we speak and oh you know I said to my wife coming here sometimes I bounce things off her I said you know in the scripture they had such a cleansing uh that they even had the priests go and uh check out the homes take all these Gods out so I thought I wonder what the people would say I said to my wife what would the people say said now uh you folks this is the word of God and we're going to come in and check and make sure there's nothing no evil gods in there if we find any DVDs or any you know uh uh some of these CDs and some of the stuff that shouldn't be there and you can come and check my home out if you want some magazine some book we'll just check it out you'll say that's my home I'd say that's Leo DEA that you say people's rights you don't have any right to my home in the Bible they had a right they walked right in and said hey out this goes fact is I'll do you a favor I'll burn it you almost sound like you agree with that Hallelujah we we can say it's a you know it's a simple thing you don't mind if I just take my time with you here this evening we can say well it's just really a simple thing but you know the while that happened on on one scripture which I don't want to get in tonight that was exactly what they did but now Samuel's taking it to a different level and that is he says you know turn turn with all your heart and the heart the heart is even more difficult you can come and if you found a if you found a piece of music or something in my house that you said hey this is out okay I'd say God bless you just Chuck it the sooner the better I didn't even know it was there okay but then when you come to the heart that's quite something it's a different thing now you're really treading on treacherous territory so well yeah but I had my feelings hurt oh so that gives us a reason to have a chip on our shoulder that has a reason to you know hold some grudge against somebody or something that's what we really should be checking out we ought to be checking out our heart is everything absolutely clear everything is all straight in our heart no wrong desires there no wrong feelings there well it's a little bit quieter than the last time but I still think that you I still think that you're agreeing brother Brenham said in the message sir we would see Jesus he said if you're a housewife or you're a preacher or you're a deacon or whatever you are in the sight of God we're all the same we're just children each one of us has a job to do so let's do it with all all of our heart so I'm not speaking to some you know great spiritual leaders or someone that has a high-profile in a church I don't care what you are I don't care I don't care you know what you think your position is it's all important to Prophet says we're all children there isn't a housewife here that is to be considered less than a deacon it's a different office but it's a great office if you're a farmer be the best farmer if you're a carpenter be the best Carpenter whatever God has has has led you into be the very best if you're a student in school be the best student in school is there anything wrong with that and to live righteously and to live holy and to live Godly you'll never regret that now there was a one woman brother brand spoke to and he said one brother rather and he says well brother dear he said you are suffering and I see a doctor before you and you've just been examined and I believe you're up for an operation now this is a sign of the Resurrection it's not just some you know discernment or revealing the secret of his heart he said you're figuring on an operation right away say he stops I feel though you've made preparations for something else else you've just been saved too just converted it's been recently this man although he was sick but he determined to make some other preparations said I need to get right with God I need to get saved and be converted and he said you've made that preparation you've just been saved you've been converted just recently because he said you had on the same same suit of clothes the same suit of clothes he's standing in there he said you had that same suit of clothes on when you gave your life to Christ I like that kind of a prophet don't you and he said isn't that right he said well don't you fear the operation brother because Jesus Christ the son of God has made a preparation for you Hallelujah I just thought that was so lovely you made a preparation in your heart and you gave your life to Christ and you surrendered it and you became a Christian you became converted you made a preparation don't have any fear Jesus made a preparation for you I say that is so wonderful that's a blessed thought I could actually close on that thought but I'm quite a from it yet the scripture Paul said in the Hebrews he said but you are come to Mount Zion you might wonder why I'm saying this now but you've come to Mount Zion and un the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels John said in Revelation 14 he said and I looked and lo a lamb stood on Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having his father's name written in their forehead Apostle Paul says you've come to Mount Zion you're not at Mount Si you're not at Mount Nebo where where the Prophet Moses was taken you're not at Mount Carmel where uh Elijah met and challenged Israel we're not even at Mount Transfiguration we're not at Mount olives we're not at Mount Calvary but we are at Mount Zion that and the prophet said that's where the word proceeds from we are there and if you haven't uh I'm sure you have but you you realize that you're where the word is proceeding from God and you say I was so blessed because you've come to Mount Zion you've come to a location you've come to a place where God's word is proceeding from and I got thinking today and I hope you don't think I'm out of line I got thinking today we're going up a mountain that young people have sang a song I'm climbing up up the Rough Side of the Mountain I don't know if I like all the words to that because uh it might be the Rough Side of the Mountain but it's not that I'm just trying to make my way to God or I might find my way to God I'm Mount our Mountain that we're coming up is a mountain where we keep hearing the word so I got thinking about the mountain climbing we're climbing a mountain and so I thought I just came to my mind I hope you don't think it's too juvenile I thought oh these people that climb mountains uh and I see pictures of the National Geographic and they're up there on top of some Peak and almost being blown right off the top to you know put the flag of their Nation there or put some identification that and and so many are asked why do you climb the mountain and many of them say well because it's there I've heard that I've read it so many times because it's there that's why I climb it I've climbed enough mountains I climbed some with with brother brandham and there were some pretty treacherous places and I don't I don't particularly have any you know any special desire to climb a mountain and risk my life but I I I've read some very interesting things about some of these people I got thinking about so I just want to see what do they do to prepare to climb a mountain what do they do to prepare to climb Mount Everest and so I Googled that you all know what that that is and the first thing I hit was a big long list you don't have enough time for me to read the list that they're going to prepare just their preparation to climb old Mount Everest that's a bunch of ashes and rock and I thought these people they they give themselves so completely to climb this Earthly mountain and here we are and we either Believe It Or we don't don't believe it that we are we are preparing for a change of this body for a transformation of this flesh into an Immortal Realm there's a there's another body that's waiting for us this all been told us we have a prophet you have a prophet said I've been there I pinched my hand did he say it I bit my finger did he say it he said I looked at my body it was only 20 25 ft away or less did he say it said it he was actually there now the question is do you really plan to go there and the next question is what preparation are we making to God what preparation are we making for this event oh I think I can just toot along just keep coming to church you know what I mean and and the rest of my time is all taken up just for the world and for my life here and all the rest of it and I'm not I'm not condemning that I'm just saying to you maybe we should open up our heart and open up our whole minds and say what is this all about and is there actually some preparation that I should be making so here's just a little bit of it there's some essential equipment oxygen canisters 5 to S 31 bottles a sack to collect ice and snow for melting and wet wipes for the washing of your body they freeze so you need to sleep with them inside your tent and if they're going to be of any use you also need a satellite phone and a two-way radio a two-way radio and some foot powder hey this is just the first little paragraph I got thinking the mountain we're climbing on I think you know a lot of a lot of people don't don't don't get me wrong but I think a lot of people your cell phone works a lot better than your two-way radio up above I see people on the cell phone all the time their cell phone works just great but he ask them to pray and they have a struggle what do I say talk like you talk on the cell phone who do you talk to on the cell phone well I talk to my friend well this is your god this is your father having any trouble talking to your father I got Tongue Tied well it's time to get your tongue Loos up say well this is a strange message you want to believe it is but it's absolutely right on target there should be nothing wrong with our two-way radio if you plan to climb this mountain if you plan to have a change of the body we got to have a good connection frequent connection believe it or not I'm going to give you some quotes as we go along in the message hear his voice brother brandham says to us if you want something from God ask him then stand still number two number three and listen to see what he's going to say about it just open up your heart number four and say number five what about it Lord Jesus oh you're quiet this is so deep it's so profound you might Escape it or it might Escape you it's so simple and that's the problem if you want something from God what's the first one ask him now number two then stand still often we're in a great nervous flurry because we need an answer from God oh I need an answer from God we're all tensed up that's not the way we get an answer from God ask him here's one who got a lot of answers from God someone is giving us real counsel ask him then stand still next listen and see what he's going to say about it and just open up your heart What About It Lord Jesus just stay there if he doesn't answer you in the first five hours you know what the next line is then wait another if he doesn't answer today then he'll answer tomorrow and if he doesn't answer this week he will answer next week stay there till he answered amen the Bible says let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having your heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water in Ephesians then he might s that that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word in Ephesians in the Ephesians parallels Joshua now we're speaking about brother Braham speaking about their journey and their inheriting the promised land and he says that's where the believer comes he comes first to a recognition that he's a sinner then he's separated by the waters the washing of the Water by the word Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ then being justified by faith he becomes a partaker and at peace with God through Christ baptized into the name of Jesus Christ to put him into the journey you get it he said into the journey then he becomes a souljourner and a pilgrim he's on his journey to what a promise that God made him now this took on such such new uh depth for me as I just read some of these things that seemed maybe so utterly simple but you know when I read the instructions of this experienced experienced climber who's climbed I think almost every Mountain over 8,000 ft he's climbed so many mountains and he's giving them instruction and and and he lets them know there'll be a time when you can't even really wash your body because it is so cold it is so bitter and you've got to prepare yourself so you can have some hygiene and some cleanliness and here's people just climbing a pile of Rock for the sake that it's there and here we are coming to church on a Wednesday night we're coming on a Sunday twice and we're giving ourselves during the week and to hear the word of the Lord I say is there anything further that we ought to do there is there indeed is and I think that we ought to take real inventory and say when God deals with you see I don't know how many I know that there's some because I've spoken to you you said I have sensed I have felt God doing something different with me I have felt that stir I have felt that wind of the holy spirit it's different these last services or the last six months or the last year I've had different things said to me some said in the last year it's been so different in the last six month month the last message is wherever it is and whatever time it is and whatever Junction it is and wherever it is all I'm saying to you because we're all different for me it might be one time for you it might be another but when that moment arrives and it might be tonight say God is speaking to me in a very special way I say then turn to him with all your heart and say God what do you want me to do search my heart oh God can you say Amen here these people and then they they go now into the food the kind of food you have to have for this kind of a journey this isn't walking just you know sightseeing they want to climb uh a record Mountain says their food mostly boil in the bag meals as well as plenty of biscuits and chocolate brother brandham said this it's not what Noah did it's not what Moses did their examples we see and read what they did but it's what he promised to do now he was he was the word back there he was the carcass for that day the day of Wesley was a carcass for that day the day of Luther was a carcass for that day we've got fresh food today and my friends I don't believe that it should be ever a stale meal I believe you ought to have fresh Mana we pray that in the in the study before we feed the sheep feed the sheep give them water to drink from the from the fountain fresh water to drink and give them a thirst for it let's not come to the house of God so encumbered and our mind so fogged in we ought to prepare ourselves when we come here to the house of God brother brandom said clearly you ought to come and sit quiet and read the Bible or pray or come to the front and just kneel quietly and prepare ourselves now you know the hallways are full you know that the ladies are chatting with the children you know that the young people they all got things to do and they're sitting out there and those are just little physical things and is that the thing to do to prepare for the word of God I say no it's not the thing to do you can get as quiet as you want I think you ought to be in here getting your heart ready for the word of God and then when you come in here and say well you know that service wasn't really what it ought to be thanks to some of you not thanks to the minister who's been waiting hours and hours on God and in prayer and the brothers waiting on God and our whole mind is focused I've spent hours and hours just even today perhaps six hours today just to wait on God to come and to study and and and leave my wife alone leave other things aside try not to even answer the phones to come here and get ready now I that's a kind of preparation I have to go through I I don't get here I'm not here to exercise myself I'm not here just to you know to give a speech there's a lot heavier Duty on that if I believe the message and I believe that we need to come and fellowship around the body word of the son of man and there's a such a solemn Duty on us standing here behind the pulpit to bring forth the word of the hour of this day that's why I say with such an emphasis when you read these things when you hear those things what what they call the Discerning of the I heard a a brother say that when we were there the gift of discernment the gift of discernment and I got up and spoke and I said you know it it wasn't discernment it was the word coming forth out of a vessel out of a prophet's mouth it wasn't just discernment friend what we had when he says to says to a woman you reason why you're troubled is you got cancer and it's in your mouth and it's on the left side of your mouth I'm telling this is specific and that isn't just telling her that for her for her satisfaction it was telling her that so she would know God was there God knew what her case was God was on on the scene and we should be saying when you hear that you say that's a sign of to me that's a sign of the resurrection and when you see the sign of the Resurrection then you know that's the sign of the Rapture and how can we have this sign after sign after sign over and over and over again emphasize and sit here and not be aware the Rapture could take place we could have the change of the body The Sweep could happen you say what if it doesn't happen you'll be better off being prepared for it you'll never regret being prepared for it if it's long gone you live your whole life out you say I'm so glad I heard those messages I'm so glad that our pastor spoke with such a with such force and such a burden on his heart that it changed my order of my life you'll never regret it you say I heard those services and I set myself in motion I did certain things I searched out my heart I searched out my home I searched out the order of things in my life and it changed because of what I heard and you'll thank God for it and we'll meet on the other side hug one another and you'll be thankful for it and I'll be thankful too amen hallelujah hallelujah it's the food for this hour I like this one you got to have some climbing apparatus if you're going to get any higher you got to have some climbing apparatus and this man says they had to have harness and an ice pick and and some other things and a clip device and etc etc and a rope and they said and he's explained to the people it moves forward but not backwards I thought praise God that's exactly the kind of apparatus you and I know need something that moves forward and helps us get higher but won't let us come down I'm hooked into something we're hooked into something won't let us go praise the Lord praise the Lord you need your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace just a few more minutes but I got a little ways to go quickly clothes you're going up into some severe violent weather clothing how you're robed is critical let me tell you friends how we're robed is critical too and I saw the angel said come and I'll show you the bride the I'll show you the Lamb's wife and it was given to her that she was arrayed in fine linen friends let me say something to you I don't want this to sound like a Works service message but there is some Works involved it does not say if you are faithful and you attend Cloverdale Bible Way and you're a good solid citizen and a good believer and you enter into fellowship and you pay your tithe and you've done all that you've just been faithful All Through The Years while that's important it doesn't say that that is how we get dressed and AR raid in fine linen the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and the Bible says that our Father Abraham it was granted to him he was counted righteous because he believed God and I have done some study I've mentioned it before I want you to listen real close this linen they said that linen they have such fine linen that has come out of the out of the Far East out of the Middle East rather they said that the linen is so fine it is so exotic and beautiful that it supersedes the price of gold in weight the linen is so costly it's so I can tell you you that the linen the fine linen that the Bride of Jesus Christ was dressed in it's very costly because it came at the hand of our hearts believing God's word and it cost something to believe the word of God it really does it costs something one man came to a minister when he had received Christ and then he was troubled and he thought that maybe he had to give it up and he said that what I'm concerned about is that this is going to cost me too much and the minister with the wisdom of God said you're exactly right it's going to cost you everything and we've got to be prepared for that it's going to cost us everything cost us everything and yet we gain everything Adam and Eve were clothed in bloody skins Aaron and his sons were clothed in Priestly robes Elijah was wrapped in a prophet's mantle other prophets and those in Repentance put on sackcloth and Ashes John the Baptist was clothed in Camel's hair the angel at the Seer the Bible says was in a long white robe Jesus on Mount Transfiguration was in a garment and the Bible says it was glistening as white as light the great Harlot she's arrayed in purple and Scarlet but the Bride of Jesus Christ is arrayed in righteousness and I'll tell you friends we're not going to get to the top of this mountain unless we have the righteousness and it's not our righteousness but there's one thing that is a criteria if we we must believe the word that is sent to us in our time believe it not a mental Ascent but believe it to a doing of it to an acting on it amen says it takes some training and I have found I've been on this way quite a long time and I don't know whether I've ever got out of the training stage it always takes some training but they said to climb this mountain you got to plan ahead I'm preaching tonight in a Ultra simplistic way and saying to this congregation I believe that God has been doing doing something special to at least some individuals and that's who I'm speaking to tonight and if it hasn't taken place with you yet it may be tonight it may be Sunday it may be at home maybe when you're listening to a message it may be that something just begins to stir and you say this is different it's different how many you felt something moving different with you I'm pleasantly surprised I've had a lot a lot of you have spoken and that's why I'm coming from this direction God wants us to take a visible step you might not even know right now what is it that I should do and I asked myself while I was studying this what is it the people are going to wonder what what should we do I just talked to you very personally now Sister Ruth and I talked on the plane we talked again today he said I just think there are things I began to think of what brother brandom said you know when we see he talked about people seeing the end of their life and I'm not talking about the end of the life I'm talking about the departure from this place into another realm and I I I have to be honest with you if this was my last service I'd have to tell you I do not believe just coming here sitting here enjoying the meeting clapping our hand listen to the song leader listen to good service go on home and enjoy you know the ABC restaurant or Starbucks or something else I don't believe that's the ritual I don't believe that's the order of the day not that there's anything wrong with those things but I just I believe that there needs to be a tightening up and we turn ourselves and index ourselves around and just say I I will give my mind to think on these Eternal things more I will I I'll I'll take I'll take some real quality time and I'm going to listen I'm going to and and I would encourage you don't listen don't listen to the message just you know like shotgun style I believe it's real good to follow a certain order listen to them in sequence and hear what he said because he continued on with the thought all the way through this just kind of little teaching but I believe it's important and if you just turn your whole heart and index it towards the Lord and then talk to him and then listen and why while you're listening you might just feel a little twinge inside a little something you know what it didn't mean anything when you said it or didn't mean anything when you did it what happened but now it just seems to come up and it's something you know what I'm not going to let this thing stand my way I'm just going to I didn't even feel convicted about it but I'm just going to make it right I can't have it in my way I can't afford it why because we're in preparation I don't want anything if these fellas here just climbing a physical Mountain I tell you what when I read what they did I said oh God I'm even ashamed of myself as a Christian these fellas go through all of this in preparation I've not made that kind of preparation the one thing I have done and I just throw myself at the mercy of God but you know as we go on we all collect a bunch of baggage and we ought to Chuck it out we get all kinds of baggage and we ought to Chuck it out I'm just drawing to a close right now plan ahead they do all kinds of training take supplements and they speak about the health hazards and what they plan for acute Mountain sickness and Frostbite and hypothermia and broken bones and sunburn and mental preparation and don't rush your buildup and understand it won't it won't be easy be prepared for lots of downtime except that you won't be mentally alert on the mountain all kinds of things and say there's all kinds of hallucinations everything then we come and we start on this walk and we think everything's just going to be you know just easy I'm on Easy Street stre now no you're in a Warfare you're in a battle and you know when things start getting hard we don't want to whimper we don't want to whimper we don't want to complain we want to be men we want to be women and this thing turned real hard against me we ought to expect that we're on our way up a Rough Side of the Mountain I might be over overstating it but I believe it needs to be overstated right now and then last and this is where I close they said to the people to these that are planning to climb picture yourself on the mountain succeeding and I would suggest to you tonight with all the mental capabilities you have you should picture yourself having succeeded and being on the other side you should picture yourself in the in in the host of the redeemed and if you can't picture yourself there it might be that you know you just don't have the confidence that you should have but those people they've got to get pumped I'm not here to pump you tonight I'm not here to get you all in I'm here to have you just look within yourself and say and I'll I'll start you where I start all kinds of people who come in for counsel I've had people and I I'm going to just like I'm counseling the whole congregation T night they come in they're so low they're so low they're so depressed they're so defeated sometimes I think I need a scoop shovel to pick them up they are so down and as a minister and you're going to counsel them and people they're so defeated they've had so much trouble they've had so much pain and anguish you know what I ask myself because I've asked myself Lord where do I start what do we do with this case how do you start so I've learned you want one of my secrets I ask him I want to start at Ground Zero are you a Son of God are you a daughter of God and quite often I've had them say say well I'd have to say yes I said wonderful that's wonderful you are a son of God you mean you're a Son of God you really believe that I do amen well hey if you're a Son of God you don't have too many problems if you're a Son of God I said did Jesus die for you yeah he did did he take your sins yeah he did I said how much of them did he take 20% 50% 75 and this one brother he lived depressed most of his life I remember it like it was yesterday and when I started getting about 75% 80% he could see where I was going and he broke into a bit of a smile I said did he take 90% he said no he took 100% I said just a second let me get this straight you're a Son of God you're born again and Jesus Christ took 100% of your sins and you got a problem I said well then let me go a little bit further did he give you anything in exchange he took all your sins per chance did he give you his righteousness he said he did great all your sins are gone now we've got you as a Son of God you're born again and Jesus Christ has taken 100% of your sins and how much of his righteousness did he give you I start going same thing 20% no now he's now he's onto my now he's onto my you know my system no he says he gave me all his righteousness I said my goodness here sits a man that is a Son of God that has all of his sins taken and all the righteousness of Jesus Christ given to you and you got a problem he said no I don't have a problem I don't have a problem I saw that man he he had lived for years under that cloud you know something like that that sounds simple that broke that thing on him because he began to believe that and you want to believe it and if you're having trouble tonight you start saying it I am a Son of God I'm a daughter of God Jesus Took 100% of my sins Jesus gave me 100% of his righteousness and I receive it and because of that I'll pass over to the other side I'll stand on this mountain hallelujah praise the Lord oh thank you Lord that's my message for you tonight we've been just slightly over an hour and I uh that's preparation for Sunday all right hallelujah we're
