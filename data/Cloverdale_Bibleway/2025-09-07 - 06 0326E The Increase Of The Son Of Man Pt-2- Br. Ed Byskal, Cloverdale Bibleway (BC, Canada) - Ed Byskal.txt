I ask brother Ken Ardal, brother Ken, if you'd come and just open the service in a word of prayer. I don't know if you have anything on your heart, just raise your hand as we go to prayer. Those on the telephone hookup, also on the internet, I urge you to do the same. for the can if you'd come. [Music] How many have a need tonight? Amen. I guess if we opened up a microphone and asked each one of us what was on our heart, loved ones, needs in our own lives, sickness and disease and friends and finance. Each one of us has a need, but we know that we serve a God that is more than sufficient for that need. And he's the one we're approaching now. He knows us better than we know ourselves. So, let's just bow. Father, we're bowing before you with our hands raised, recognizing that there is no good thing in us, Lord. recognizing that without the deposit of God and that predestinated life within us, Lord, that we would be inadequate, that we would be unable to even begin to approach a living God, the mighty one that created heavens and earth. And yet tonight, we find ourselves in the economy of God. We find ourselves redeemed tonight, Father. We sign we find ourselves coming boldly before your throne Lord with our petitions God once again united together as saints of like precious faith we're asking Lord tonight that you would come with every uplifted hand with every uplifted heart father we pray that you would minister life minister grace minister mercy we pray Lord we don't want justice tonight we want mercy we pray Lord that the God of mercy would come and meet each need each life Father, we ask Lord for the service tonight, the preaching of the word, the receiving of the word. We ask that you will give us ears to hear, Father. Lord, that still small voice that would lead us and guide us. We pray, Lord, that each one that would be here, those that do not know you, we pray that you would minister mercy to them, Lord. Save the lost, we pray. Heal the sick, we ask, Lord Jesus. Deliver the oppressed and the needy tonight, Lord. And that will happen by the receiving of your word. We're praying, Lord, that you will anoint brother Ed as he would come once more. Lord, we pray that you would move amongst every heart and every life, have your divine way, Lord, as we commit ourselves to you in Jesus' name. Amen. [Music] Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. I want to welcome everyone tonight. If you're visiting with us, I know we got a number of out of town guests here for communion. We want to say God bless you. Our sister Rhysa and a group have a special for us as they come and get ready. Let's sing said I found a love that pardons. Said I found a love that pardens. There for my race to cover all my sins. Oh Jesus. Holy Jesus. No, it's Jesus. He is the one. He's the rock of salvation. He's a firm foundation. It's in Jesus. He is the one. [Music] [Music] broken, mocked and scorned. was a man hanging on a cross with a crown of thorns. Who is he? [Music] This man who died for me. This given son who was born to die so we could be redeemed. He died for you. He died for me. [Music] He took my pain and he bore my shame. That day on Calary, the bleeding one was God's holy son. What kind of man is this who walk that road alone? Jesus. It was supposed to be you and me hanging on that tree. It was our sin that crucified him. We don't deserve any mercy. So as we come to you today, we remember what you gave. Lord, through this bleeding word you have revealed to us our name. He died for you. He died for me. He took my pain and he bore my shame that day on Calary. The beating. The holy son. What kind of man is this who walk this road alone? Jesus. Oh, I didn't see, but I believe.

The leading one. only son. What kind of man is this who walk this road alone? He died for you. He died for you. For we're free. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're no longer in captivity. He took our pain anymore. The day on Calary. &gt;&gt; The breeding was &gt;&gt; the only son. What kind of man is this to walk this road alone? &gt;&gt; Oh, he died for you. For you.

I'm happy because the devil's defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we rejoice &gt;&gt; over such a glorious victory that we have? &gt;&gt; Uh I'd like to sing also the course high and lifted up. I just want to give him praise and glory and we're going to have I'm going to have a testimony uh tonight. Brother Mark Neighbor is going to come and give a testimony. Amen. We're so thankful when God does something in a person's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's so genuine and wonderful when you tell how the candle got lit, how it got relit or how the Holy Spirit begin to blow and fan those embers. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't take much of an ember. &gt;&gt; Once the Holy Spirit, he knows how to ignite it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. High and lifted up. We'll sing it together. And brother Mark, you count that. High and lifted up. High lifted up. Coming back to rule and reign forever. I lift it up in Jesus Christ. Heat. Heat. [Music] He's coming back to forever [Music] is Jesus Christ. Amen. That's what it's all about tonight. I'd asked the brothers just to play at least part of a song that uh my wife wrote and I think that when she wrote it, there were some people that had come and asked her, "Well, who did you write it for?" And and uh she didn't say who it was for, but different ones and said, "Oh, that really spoke to me." But maybe I'll tell the rest of the story after you hear hear that song if the brothers could play that. [Music] Lord, hear my cry in my great need [Music] For my loved ones, I now plead [Music] arrest their soul. [Music] Halt this downward slide. Break down barriers. Strip away objects of pride. [Music] If they are thine, give me vision beyond wine to rise in faithful love and boldly say to them, [Music] "Even as you walk away, I see you restored. Lord, though your first love has died, I see it alive. As you build a wall of lies, truth will prevail. I see you fully satisfied behind the veil. The tokens applied. There's blood on the door. That door is now closing. I'm still believing, Lord. [Music] An eagle blind and wrapped in heavy chains stumbles down [Applause] pleasures dark lane. Shake out the feathers replace with thorns. [Music] If through fiery pain a sinner soul can be reborn. But even as you walk away, I see you restored. Though your first love has died, I see it alive. As you build a wall of lies, truth will prevail. I see you fully satisfied [Music] behind the wheel. You can know the wonder again. Perfect. Release in him. Please yield as he speaks today. Time is slipping away. [Music] I think you have the idea there for uh for those of you that you see me sitting in church over here and may not know um may may not know me that well. Um my family moved here in 1990 and uh we began attending church here and as soon as we moved here uh God did a great miracle in my life and uh supernaturally delivered me from the things of the world. And shortly after 1990 I was baptized and began serving the Lord um at that time. And uh it was uh I guess 2 years after that uh God gave me a wife and we Elizabeth and we got married in this church and uh as many of you know I guess you got married that have gotten married. There's a lot more to I guess uh life once you get married responsibilities you know the Bible speaks of u the car the seed falling into into gr into the ground and uh some some seed falls into good ground some gets uh uh blown away I guess I don't know if that's exact uh scripture reference but you uh through the cares of life the seed is choked and I guess that's what what I allowed to happen. It just didn't happen, you know, by chance, but I allowed it. And uh I just found just that I was starting to drift. And I still came to church, you know, and uh just spiritually I was drifting. And um God would continue to speak to me and in the services and and the different ministers, they'd say, you know, you have you should be a the spiritual high priest of your home. And I never just could quite attain to that uh level in my home. And uh it uh it was um I guess uh right after we went to to Mount Baker camp, we had a visiting minister um brother I guess it was brother Donnie Reagan. He was speaking at that camp and I still remember something he said that kind of struck me at that time. It was that you could sit in the best message church in the in the world and find yourself spiritually dead. Right. &gt;&gt; And at that time I I could I guess I could say I wasn't wasn't dead spiritually yet, but death is a process. And uh over the years, it was a a sliding, I guess, backsliding. And probably nobody knew, but it it happened so slowly. you start to allow things into your life that uh if you said hey three years ago, four years ago, you you'd say that and you go, "No, I would never do that." But then as you backslide, it becomes easier and easier to justify things. And uh so there was a a natural event I guess you remember September 11th and for some reason that really affected me as I saw the suffering of people and mankind you know just people I don't know but it for some reason it just really struck me and uh so many innocent people had died and you know you know the story. But then I I guess uh Satan kind of I I guess it had to have been the devil began to get me to doubt well there's not maybe not even a god. And you have to realize I was raised in the message. So I knew the message appeared and in uh psy you know this message psychology I guess you'd say and knew the quotes and uh knew all that head knowledge part but uh continued to slide over the years and uh started feeding well I didn't start but continued to feed on the raw wrong things and music. Um, you know, and that music is a subtle thing, especially country music because country music came from from the go from uh southern gospel and it was backsliden people that started singing country music. But in country music, they kind of sing about God. So backsliden person can kind of, you know, hey, it's kind of their way of justifying, hey, it's okay. So, uh, and then like brother Ed said this morning, what you feed on, you become what you feed on. &gt;&gt; And, uh, so I wasn't this whole time I just wasn't feeding on the right things. And I related to brother Ed the other day about how brother Brandham said that which dog is winning, the white dog or the black dog. Talked to the Indian chief and he said which one I feed the most. And I was feeding the wrong one. And now I might say some things that might shock some people, but when I was in the world, uh, alcohol, drugs was a problem. And for some reason, I allowed the alcohol demon of alcohol back into my life. And you imagine you see somebody sitting in church, they you don't know what you know what they're going through. And that's what I was going through. And Elizabeth at this, you know, through this whole thing that kind of set her into desperation. And she spoke to brother Biscll. She never one thing I I give her great credit for she didn't speak to her friends about about me you know blab but she always made me look good to the people which I think down the road would would pay off in that you know if she would have spoken to a lot of people it would have been a lot harder to you know to face people but um so she was just a faithful prayer warrior and and began to pray and spoke with brother Bisco about it. And I guess I didn't know that at the time. And uh so brother Ed, I I probably I believe I could say without doubt that he took this began to take this matter to prayer as well. And uh we had a visiting minister about a month ago, I guess, during winter camp, brother Aaron McGary. And during his services, he spoke some very direct things. And we don't I guess I way I look at it as we can't hear it straight enough. And uh so even in those services, um God had started to deal with me again, especially when it was so direct. And I know I knew that like I said before maybe I was doubting that there was a God, but who could who could speak so direct and know exactly be as in your bed chamber as it were and speak such direct things. And so, uh, I had come home from work on, uh, it was February the 23rd on a Thursday, and Elizabeth had a nice dinner all ready to go. on. So, I sat down. She put the kids to bed because I usually get home 8 to 9:00. And she started to started to speak with me and uh told me how burdened she was for me. And uh so, you know, I thought, well, that's, you know, I appreciate that. And but my, you know, my mind was filled with so many questions. And when you're not feeding on the on the word, it's easy for the devil to get in there and cause so many doubts. Pretty soon you don't know who you are. And so I just was telling her some of these questions I had. I said, you know, if God's a healer, how come people aren't healed? And the different ones that have have gone on to be with the Lord, I said, what about them? You know, God, how come God doesn't didn't heal them? But uh I'll get to that a little bit later. How God answered that question. So, she said to me something I that I thought, well, what she said was if there's any uh why don't you listen to some uh messages and download I have an MP3 player and she said, you know, why don't you uh download some sermons and uh start listening to those and see if there's anything that that may be there that God could awaken it. And like I said, God was already starting to deal with me. And I said, 'Okay, I'll I'll uh do that and I'll I'll listen to the these messages and and I for I drive for a living, so I have quite a bit of time uh window time in a in a truck and on the way back and forth to work. So I uh I did that. I had I think about 12 messages. And I remember one night on the way to uh or one morning, I guess it was middle it seemed like the middle of the night. It was about 2:00 in the morning. I was on my way to work and I was listening to this these message uh one of these messages in particular and I I remember praying and I said, "God, if you're real, do something that I can't do myself and take away the desire for these things." So, I continued to to feed on that. And in one of the messages, it happened to be for some reason uh it was a message from the church uh the Happy Valley of Brother Donnie Reagan's church. And he had mentioned in there that there was in the one in the middle of this service that there was a sister in their church that had gotten cancer. And it was actually a sister, a mother of one of the brothers in the church. and she was a believer and she had was stricken with cancer very bad and she was on her sounded like on her deathbed and she just raised up one day and just started praising God and brother Reagan said that that was like a slap in the face to the devil because he says God doesn't redeem our flesh this body but he redeems our soul and and And it it struck me, you know, I thought, well, that's what happened with Sister Marge, that God had redeemed her soul and and she maintained her testimony to the end and chose to take her and this this flesh is just a temporary house. So, that was one direct answer. I thought, well, that, you know, that's right. And so and and some of the other questions I mentioned to brother Ed that I had that I thought were such great questions in my mind just dissolved when I began to listen to the word. And so brother Ed was still under this burden because he didn't know all the things that had been happening in my life you know in the me listening to the messages. So he came and he he read out of Malachi and it's a me a a scripture that is very common to believers. He said, "Behold," this was on um March the 5th, and he spoke the message, "He shall turn the heart." And he and he read from this scripture, "Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite this earth with a curse. And so that was his text. So I sat there and I listen and he as he spoke about how that there's there'll be corners in our lives that will come that that we won't be able to negotiate the curve oursself. And I knew I was in that place. So I listened as as he spoke that and he then he began right at the end of the service. You remember he spoke about the young lady in the insane institution and how she uh was there and spoke with brother Brandham and how she said I tried so many times before you know and and that felt like that was me and I so I believe that God left in 99 maybe it was for nobody else but me that day. So after the service, I responded and came up right down here in front of this speaker here and began to pray. And I asked God sincerely and earnestly to loose me from those things that had bound me &gt;&gt; and I asked him to fill me and create in me a clean heart. And I guess there was many people here and uh many people praying and and so I think brother Ernie prayed with me over here and he asked me he says is there anything that that uh you have on your heart that you want to pray about? And I I just couldn't utter the words. And so he prayed with me and and uh so after I think brother Ed had sang a few songs and dismissed and I guess when he came back around he could he could see me said uh down here and he came over and he asked me he said he said uh could I pray with you? And I think the key there is with not for because we have to want it ourselves. And so so he uh he began to just talk to me and counsel me there. Told me a few things. And uh so he uh he told me too. He said, he said, "Don't expect," he he had heard me praying, I guess, and I was just crying out to God, and he said, "Don't expect any any lightning bolts or any anything like that, but just begin to thank him." So, I began to thank him for uh for my deliverance and thank you for his filling, infilling. And I got up and I like I said, I didn't feel like there was anything lightning bolts or anything, but I believed when I got up. It was just simple. I I don't know how to explain it. I just believed that I've been delivered from those demons that had haunted me. So, I don't know uh how else to explain it, but I believe that God heard heard my prayer and heard brother Bisll, my wife, as I as I was on my face before God. And I can say that God delivered me with a mighty hand that day. &gt;&gt; And I I communicated talked to Brother Edward by via email after that service. And I just gave him a bit of a testimony. I said, you know, I feel like how uh uh Samson must have felt that after he had been deceived by uh Delilah and they shaved his hair off and the power of God and left him. Well, while he was there, his hair began to grow back. And then, Brother Biscll, I told him, I said, 'I felt like I haven't I've never experienced God in that way before in my life, his nearness. And and he said he said that that was a perfect reference and he's used that before, how that he could reach up and feel the stubble &gt;&gt; and the power of God had returned to him. And I believe that day that the m the dynamics of the Holy Spirit had come came to me that day and met the mechanics. So, I just wanted to give glory to God &gt;&gt; and give thanks to him for &gt;&gt; for doing that for me. And it's it's for I I just was praying with the kids and I was for some reason I when I was praying I I started think uh praying out loud about uh uh Legion and he was he was uh bound with chains and they break the chains and and uh cut himself with stones. But when Jesus he saw Jesus a far off and there wasn't enough devils in hell to stop Jesus the word from delivering uh Legion and Brother Brandham said about Legion that he was he was a good boy and he began to hang around the wrong people and uh that was the beginning of his backsliding and one day he found himself in the tombs and that I just believe that there was not enough devils in hell that could keep me from being restored as you heard in that song. And also uh I just uh think that I was also praying that day too with the kids. I said, you know, in my prayer that uh it just you don't uh God looks down. He said, "This one's mine. That one's mine. this one's mine and he just begins to draw and not one of them will be lost. &gt;&gt; So, I want to just give thanks to God and uh thank you for those who did pray for me. I know there was hardly anybody that knew what I was struggling with, but God is good. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation. &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] creation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel at the service. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm I'm just h I'm just reveling &gt;&gt; in what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't know. We don't see everything that's taking place. But this uh I uh I asked brother Mark if he would give this testimony because this situation also had all the ingredients for a marvelous success and I wouldn't mention it but brother Mark has already mentioned it that was he had a wife that prayed for him and I know a little bit about that. I know a wee bit about the 4 and 5 in the morning and the prayers that went on into the night and how she didn't talk to anybody and was very reluctant to talk to me and we emailed back and forth and I would just encourage her and uh and then uh God sovereignly and then when I thought it was so perfect element number two is she said say to her husband to brother Mark, why don't you just start listening to some messages, &gt;&gt; had confidence in that word that was coming forth &gt;&gt; and heard the prophet speak, heard his s his servants speak and just a sentence, God doesn't have to speak volumes of encyclopedias. He just has to speak a word &gt;&gt; and just a word anchors in there. And that brother Mark did that. That to me is element number two. And number three, he kept coming to church and gave God an opportunity. And if you wait long enough, the shepherd will bring you in. Hallelujah. And we give him praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we? Did we sing high and lift it up? We did. Okay, let's sing it once again, shall we? I am lifted up with all his glory. [Music] I am lifted up in roses, coming back to rule and reign forever. [Music] I lift it up in Jesus Christ. [Music] Amen. Our dear loving Lord Jesus, we are here tonight to give you thanks, &gt;&gt; to praise your name. We thank you for your servants, oh God, that have declared the word of truth. We thank you for this grand and glorious victory in our brother Mark Neighbor's life. And on behalf of sister Elizabeth, his wife, and how they hung fast to your promises that you have spoken it. And Lord, I thank you for the moment he responded and that we have this testimony tonight. We can say of a truth, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. You delivered the maniac out of the tombs, oh God. And you have delivered, oh God, each one of us from our life of death and desperation. And here we are tonight redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Lord, be with us since we are soon are approaching the Lord's table. In in your name, we ask that you will anoint your word. Anoint me as I stand here before your people who you purchased that day at Calvary. in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. I'm going to read a few scriptures with you out of Philippians the 2 chapter starting at verse 4 down through verse 9. We're carrying on from this morning. Did you enjoy this morning? Was it all right? And look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we bless that name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. We see as Jesus is approaching this latter part, the very la latter part of his life which was moving towards the cross. I believe it's only two three weeks ago. We mentioned how many prophecies there was concerning Christ's coming. How many prophecies there were concerning his ministry? I think about eight or nine in one case. Uh six or seven on the other case. 29 prophecies were fulfilled from the Old Testament. 29 were fulfilled concerning his crucifixion and and uh and the suffering in that time. So as we see and observe the spirit of God, the spirit that was in Christ moving him through this last uh process of his life. And this is really truly the uh what I am referring to as the increase. How the son of man he was known as a son of man because he was the god prophet. How he increased it was such a rapid increase as it was to the fulfilling and the perfection of his of his ministry and what he was called on earth to do. And I will say that Jesus increased. He increased. We're not so concerned about the the uh uh how quick it was, &gt;&gt; how rapid it was, but we are concerned about what happened. And what really happened is he took this uh body of clay which as I spoke this morning when God sowed uh uh sowed by word by spoken word swed it in the earth and gave promise and that which was in the patriarchs and in the prophets throughout the old testament and how those fibrous roots of the tree of life took hold and he planted them in the earth and he grew and grew and then finally that word the prophet said that those those pro prophesied words a virgin shall conceive. Said the word of that prophet lodged in the womb of a virgin. Now that's not poetic language. That's what happened. She had a physical happening when she believed the word of the angel. &gt;&gt; Let it be unto me according to thy word. He said, "And the Holy Spirit shall overshadow you, and that which is conceived in thee is of the Holy Ghost." And she had a physical happening that took place in her by believing the word of God. So, the word was the seed before it was here. And that was the seed of the woman that would bruise the serpent's head and came forth uh for the prophet also speaks that you know uh Mary ate food like any any one of us eats food and as a mother eats food and the and the child in the womb is calling for certain things and the child is nourished and she ate food from the earth and the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. Here the seed of God is taking the elements of the earth which is of the earth which had been cursed. He's taking that cursed earth creating a body for himself came out in a natural birth in into this world and took this body of earth right up to the cross. But not only that, he matured and increased until that body he took that earth right through to a change. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a hope. He took it right through to a change. And when they went to the tomb to find that body that he lived in, that body wasn't there. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, when he came up out of the water, pointing to the scripture, when he came out of the water, had been baptized, and that voice said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." The prophet puts it in this language. This is the first part of the earth that I have redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And through this part of the earth that I have redeemed, I'll redeem them all. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? And so now he's moving moving up and the and and John the Baptist when he introduced Christ, he told his disciples and told his hearers, "He must increase and I must decrease." The truth of the matter is if he does increase, you will decrease. &gt;&gt; You will decrease. And when he said he he must he must increase the increase in the Hebrew word which is used or rather the Greek word which is used in this case. It has a really a strange reference and you'll need to think about it for perhaps just a moment. But the word in the Greek to increase is to beat forward or to lengthen it out by hammering. This increase as a son of man Jesus Christ was increasing. It didn't come by living on easy street. &gt;&gt; It didn't come by ease &gt;&gt; and setting back. It didn't come on a bed of roses. &gt;&gt; It didn't come his increase. And that's the son of man, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, who we say is in us. &gt;&gt; And if he's going to increase, it's not on easy street that it happens. It's coming through perhaps difficulties and obstacles and hurdles and misunderstandings and all kinds of other things that comes by our way. But by that constant pounding, whether it be from the world or whether it be from anyone, whether it be from family or friends or associates or whatever more, God allows it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's increasing us. It's lengthening it out. It's bringing it to its destination &gt;&gt; to lengthen it by hammering as a smith forges the metals to promote and to forward and to bring it further to go forward to advance to proceed in time. And we're advancing in time also. We are creatures of time but we're advancing by the things that we endure. And the scripture says, "He that endureth to the end." What's it indicating? That it's not it's not just, you know, drifting through life in some kind of easy vein or channel. We must expect that this Christian walk is a battle. Can you say amen? This Christian walk is to be a struggle because we're struggling against waring against all kinds of principalities and darkness and powers of darkness. That's what the scripture says. Put you on therefore the whole armor of God. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching tonight. Put on the whole armor of God that you might be able to withstand &gt;&gt; in the evil day. And this is the evil day. For the day is far spent, to increase and to make progress. And it comes from a root word to increase. And the word is copto. And copto is to be whale and to lament and to cut down, to whail and to mourn. And he was indeed. He cried out in the garden as the spirit was to leave him. And he had to go from Gethsemane to Calvary as a man. And as that spirit, he cried out, "If it be possible, if there's any possibility, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done." And I tell you from there to the Calvary and what he suffered through then from that time it was a bitter cup and he and he drank it for you and I and I say glory to his name. &gt;&gt; But he also we are the scripture says that we are partakers of his sufferings. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are to expect that. And if we expect an easy life and just to make our way through this, you know, God will uh you may well be able to do that. But if you're going to be a real victorious believer, you got to be prepared. This is a battle. I'm in a battle. And the prophet says, "We battle every inch of it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, when it said he must, I'm just going to He said he must increase. He must. And I want to take this word he must. It is not merely that it is necessary or there is a need but also he must because it's right, it's correct, it's proper, he must increase and I must decrease because it's important because it's necessary that we decrease. &gt;&gt; It's a necessity. And I find that the language which is used, the language which God has chosen is so unique. It's not only that he must increase, not only that it's necessary and I must decrease, but that but that word must also comes from a root word where even it comes to bonds to fasten with chains. We are bound. That word of the scriptures, that word of God which is declared, he must increase and he that one he is dwelling in us and I must decrease. We don't only merely have a mental ascent to that. But if we are indeed believers, then we believe it even to the point of bonds. I am bound to this word. &gt;&gt; And and and the prophet speaks about the apostle Paul. Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ. What was he referring to? This very phrase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Referring to he must increase. I am bound to that &gt;&gt; word. He must be preached &gt;&gt; in the far corners of I must take this gospel. I am a debtor. He knew that he'd been called. He knew that he had been commissioned. And he was bound by that word. It wasn't just a phrase in his mind that this gospel must be preached. It must be preached. And he was bound to that. And oh, how the prophet says that we would be prisoners. &gt;&gt; What a blessed thing to be prisoners to the word of God tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. in a message, let your light so shine before men. Prophet says, and we're coming to communion in a little bit, but he said, "For I truly think that is the duty of every Christian to take communion." Now, I'm going to take this from an approach, and you may think that I am somewhat fanatical about it, and that's okay, however you want to feel about it. But I'm going to take this, he said, it's the duty of every Christian to take communion. The Bible said, "If you take this not, then you have no part with me." And I believe that it is a showdown time for the Christians. If we do not take it, we have no part with him. And if we take it unworthily, then we're guilty of the body and death of Christ. God forbid that anyone here would take it unworthily. So we come with with just deathbed sincerity and earnestness, do we not? &gt;&gt; People take this so glibly. &gt;&gt; Sometime doesn't hardly mean anything. Some soda crackers and grape juice and who cares what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we care. &gt;&gt; We care. &gt;&gt; He said, "So it gets to a place where it keeps the Christian prayed up. So when he comes to communion, we should come reverently and solemnly, sacredly walking up, confessing all of our wrongs, praying one for another." Not only that, he said we should feel if there's a brother or a sister among us that we feel is just a little bit out of line. somewhere. Our hearts ought to be burdened for that person on communion night especially to see them that they'll that they'll be able to walk up and take communion and not be condemned with the world because they are our brothers and sisters. I can I can I can say that probably we don't usually come to the communion table with that kind of a burden. But that kind of a burden when we think or see or know someone that's not quite in line or we feel they're not quite that we become so burdened for them. Oh God, don't let anything stand in their way. &gt;&gt; Oh God, don't let anything condemn them. Let that be cleared out. work with them, deal with them, speak to them so they can come and partake of the communion table. That's what that's what the prophet's saying. That should be amongst us. &gt;&gt; Not one here, not one there, but it should be amongst us. That's the kind of spirit that should prevail. And I was determined tonight to unload my heart and preach my heart. This should not just be one or two or the minister, the deacons, or whatever more. This is for everybody. And everybody should say, "Amen." Amen. &gt;&gt; So be it. &gt;&gt; Men, women, husbands, wives, young people, whoever we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as Jesus is coming to this latter part of his ministry and as I referred to this morning and God speaking on the mount transfiguration, this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him. It is spoken also in the in Hebrews, who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared. And though he wear a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. And being made perfect, being made complete, being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto them that obeyed him. He was always without sin. &gt;&gt; But he yet as a son, he had to m become matured and he became matured by the things which he suffered. It doesn't say that he was made complete when the people ran out with branches to make him king and the people took off their coats and put their garments down on the path so that the little donkey could ride over them. That isn't what made him complete. &gt;&gt; But it was when people misunderstood him, when people accused him, when people cast uh nasty things in his teeth and spit upon him, he was made perfect. Why was he made perfect? because he had the opportunity to prove then that he had that character of the son of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when you have the opportunity. And that's where we don't want to fail. &gt;&gt; That's when we don't want to fail. We're not talking about when you are able to embrace one another and you're around friends and you shake hands and uh whether it be young people or whoever. We all got our little uh association of friends. We got those that we really get along easy with and and we we that's not what that's not what develops your character. &gt;&gt; That's not what develops your character. &gt;&gt; It's that one that might be in the world or wherever they are rub you the wrong way. make you bite your tongue. You just want to give them a piece of your mind. It's then that God gives you an opportunity to prove you're a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; That's when and that is why the scripture says that things will wax worse and worse in the world. Why? Because the the bride of Jesus Christ, I'll declare it according to God's word, is going to shine brighter and brighter and become stronger. And she's going to increase &gt;&gt; and is increasing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We talk about a rapture. A rapture is for people that have increased. If if if the son of man, Jesus Christ, if he was made perfect, complete by the things which he suffered and that one is living in you now, he's not going to change his system. &gt;&gt; He's not going to change the order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You follow me? &gt;&gt; He's not going to he's not going to put it in reverse. It's the same one that's living in us. And he he in us is made complete for this age &gt;&gt; by the world that we are in and what it is that we endure and what it is that we suffer. &gt;&gt; You know some people including myself we have difficulty with our hardships. I'm talking about hardships things that grind you down fine. But tonight, after hearing what I'm saying, you should open your mouth and say, "God, I thank you for those difficulties. I thank you for those steep mountains. I thank you for those boisterous waters. I thank you for the time when I didn't know whether I was up or down. I thank you for that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I look over this audience and I see I I see those that I've sat and talked to and fellowshipped with. I know a little bit about your your your earlier life. I'm not talking about life and sin. I'm talking about the hardships, what you've gone through and you've had great upsets. &gt;&gt; You've had all kinds of things that have been such a great hardship to you. You've had people turn away from you. You've had to leave family. Those of you that have been in the callings, what's it like to leave a mother, &gt;&gt; to leave a father? &gt;&gt; I tell you what, that grinds a person's soul. that makes a man or a woman stand up and realize either she is more precious or I found another one that is more precious. &gt;&gt; I found one who's a lily of the valley. I found one who's a rose of Sharon. I found one who's fairer than 10,000. And I'm ready to leave all and everything to follow him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that when that ground down in your heart, that gave you opportunity to increase and the son of man increasing within you and coming to a a fullness and to a maturity to a more perfectly developed, fully developed. That's what it is. He was made complete. He was made fully developed in his character. And the dictionary says approaching perfection. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like you to observe closely and consider deeply this moment as Christ is coming. I want to bring I'm going to bring just a nub of my service to you now because I don't want to I don't want to delay the service unduly. One of the great marvels as I pondered this crucifixion and and the Christ time of suffering. One of the great marvels. Now remember, I'm not speaking about Christ's crucifixion and suffering just 2,000 years ago. I'm speaking about him living in you. That same Christ, not another one. That same one. All that was in Christ is now where? &gt;&gt; It's in us. &gt;&gt; In the bride. All that was in him is now in you. Not some leftover outside. All that was in him was in you. All that was in God is poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ is poured now into you. And the process has not been reversed. It's the same process. It was his turn at one time. Now it's our turn. &gt;&gt; And as he moved to this time, he had suffered so many things from friend and foe alike. And yet he could come to a point after which he had experienced and I'm going to just relate some of them. Jesus in the garden forsaken when the soldiers came. Jesus in the garden betrayed with a kiss. Jesus in the garden. And the scripture says, "Then his disciples fled and left him." Jesus before his accusers, I'm talking about Jesus now, before his accusers, never once uttered or responded in an ill- fashion or wrongly. Sometimes there was something said it was very direct, could have been very sharp, but it was not to be snide or to be facitious or to be sarcastic. He never tried to degrade them. He was submitting himself. He was a prisoner to the word and the promise &gt;&gt; that was spoken of him. &gt;&gt; Jesus at the cross and before his smiters. He held no grudge. He sought no sympathy. He wasn't on a telephone, if they had one back then, trying to get sympathy from someone. &gt;&gt; He held his peace and his strongest reprimands that he ever gave was for the lack of faith. &gt;&gt; With the passing of time, we all collect baggage. But I want to give an example of our supreme example of Jesus Christ. You've been hurt. You've had friends who have left you. You've been insulted. You perhaps have been even lodged a grudge. You've had those kind of things. You've been wounded. &gt;&gt; Some for the gospel perhaps, some not for necessarily the gospel. We all have had we've been misunderstood as I spoke of Joseph. We've been perhaps disliked and even hated. &gt;&gt; All of these things a true believer will experience. But now here's our supreme example. And he's moving up. He's increasing in his maturity to his finality to his perfection. When I say perfection, I'm talking about completion. And when he got there, he held nothing against any of these, &gt;&gt; but was able to say, he was able to say that one that is in you was able to say in all truth, Father, forgive them, &gt;&gt; for they know not what they do. That to me is Christ &gt;&gt; increased. &gt;&gt; And this is not a story of 2,000 years ago. This happens to be March the 26th. That's a service for now. This is where we're at. &gt;&gt; And this is the kind of congregation God is looking for. This is the kind of people God is expecting. These are the kind of sons and daughters that God is expecting. And I tell you that's the kind of congregation where the supernatural is happening on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Can you say Lord do that work in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do that work in me. &gt;&gt; I pray that the Holy Spirit will so press this down upon you. Make it such a reality in your own being that you'll feel what I feel within my spirit in a thinking man's filter. Prophet said, "How do you like how do you like a thinking man's filter?" He asked the question, "When you go on the street to rub arms with the world tomorrow, brother, sister, have you got a thinking man's filter?" He says, "When that man calls you a holy roller, do you use a thinking man's filter?" He's just starting. And when somebody says something evil against you, do you have a thinking man's filter? Do good for evil. Pray for those that despitefully use you and those who persecute you, then you're breathing through a thinking man's filter. For if you love those just who love you as we shook one another's hand, that's dearly beloved in the Lord. That's good. But can you also love the unlovable? That's the thinking man's filter. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of Christ in you, loving those who don't love you. And then you have a reward of God. But now, if you do it as a duty, you still haven't got the thinking man's filter. He says you're only up in the second cycle. And here I have highlighted. But if from your heart you really love him, then you're breathing through a thinking man's filter and it satisfies a holy man's taste. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that you know from your heart you forgive everybody everything. So no matter what has taken place, &gt;&gt; that is a tall order. That's a tall order. might be beyond us right now. Might be beyond me. Might be beyond you, but it's not beyond you opening your mouth and saying, "God, &gt;&gt; that's beyond my understanding, but grant that." &gt;&gt; It has been spoken, let me have that. Let me possess that. &gt;&gt; Let's take brother Mark's example and just start feeding on the word. How can I get that? How can I obtain that? Just start feeding on that word, feeding that soul, feeding that inside man until we can be forgiving for everybody, for everything, whatever it might be. &gt;&gt; I like to see that church, that church is a powerhouse. &gt;&gt; That church is a powerhouse for God. &gt;&gt; That church will have Christ as a main theme in their talking, in their walking, in their worship, in every part of their life. That he will be the central theme. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "We call," Paul said in Hebrews, "We call to remembrance the former days in which after you were illuminated, you endured a great flight of afflictions, partly whilst ye were made a gazing stop, both by the reproaches and afflictions, and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. The spoiling, the actual plundering of your goods. The robbery is one of the meanings of it. We can have a lot of reasons. I thought if anyone had a reason to hold a grudge, it could have been to my Lord. &gt;&gt; We accumulate things. We all have. We accumulate baggage. We accumulate. We collect stuff. in our memory bank stores. Those times when we've been misunderstood or some friend withdrew from us or perhaps finally left you. Someone said something hurtful, a hurtful thing or spread a false accusation. Something was slanted so as to destroy your integrity. You might say, "Where do those things happen?" If you live for Christ, they will happen. &gt;&gt; They will happen. You don't know. You may have applied for some job, but some whisper out there. Oh, I think they're one of those, you know, fanatics. You may have lost your place, lost your opportunity, or whatever more. And I'm not only speaking this for what we may have experienced, but for what you may experience in the future. And when that time arrives that you can say before God there's not just with the lips but from the heart &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; there's nothing in my heart &gt;&gt; I can sit with that brother sit with that sister and there's nothing in my heart &gt;&gt; hallelujah that is the increased and friends we we are we don't only claim to be but we are believers of this message that's why we're here this message is not an it is not a diluted word. It's a very strong word. &gt;&gt; And if we feed on the body word of the son of man, we will become what we feed on. We will become that kind of a person. &gt;&gt; We will become that kind of a believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And as I said this morning and I I repeat again tonight, you don't have to struggle with it. You have to feed on the right thing and receive it into the right atmosphere and it will bring forth of its own kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Good. Jesus had an opportunity and I want to bring you to this part where Jesus said to his disciples, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me." But the key to this verse is in the previous three verses. And the previous verses say this. From that time, listen closely now. From that time Jesus had arrived a certain moment. And from that time forth, that's when he began, Jesus began to show his disciples how he must go to Jerusalem and how he will suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and raised again the third day. And Peter took him took him and began to rebuke him and saying, "Be it far from thee, Lord. this shall not be unto thee. &gt;&gt; And Jesus turned at that wonderful word of encouragement from his faithful disciple Peter. Jesus turned and says, "Get behind me, Satan." That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Thou perceivest not. Thou savorest not the things of that be of God, but those that be of men. You're a man. You don't want to see me suffer. You don't want that to happen. But get behind me, Satan. And when they were trying to deliver him from it, he said, "But how then, if I'm delivered from this, and if you do this, how then must must the scriptures be fulfilled? I am bound to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; And in order for me to increase and fulfill this word, it is this pounding. It is this lengthening by this uh by this uh uh fulfillment of the scripture. It is this uh uh incredible weight that's upon me. Not only him, but I declare it'll be if we live where we're supposed to live. If we live the kind of lives and the kind of testimony, the kind of witness we are and we will experience these things. And we say we should say not my will, Father, &gt;&gt; but thine be done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God, give us a church full of people. God, grant us a church full of people. I tell you, those of you that live, I know what it's like living in your living at your job and living the kind of life that you're trying to make a living and you're trying to work with this world and you're rubbing shoulders with them and and whatever more and you men that are in business and you sisters with the school system or whatever more. We've got all kinds of things and Satan has so interwoven himself into the politics and into the education and into the entertainment part and every part, every aspect of life that we're constantly fighting and struggling and waring against those things. I say God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. But keep your balance. Keep your balance and keep your eye solely upon the upon the goal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is it making some sense to you this evening? &gt;&gt; And that is when Jesus said, "If any man will come after me, it's not just a a a a statement that he put out there to leave, but if any man come after me, let him deny himself." And I'm going to come to a close quickly. Let him deny himself. And that denying of himself is to affirm that one has no acquaintance or connection with someone. Hello. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Let him deny himself," that means you don't know yourself after the flesh. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "I know how many men?" &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No men. &gt;&gt; Was he a man? He had denied himself to such a degree that he didn't recognize the acquaintance of what a what Paul wanted. &gt;&gt; It was what God wanted. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We deny ourselves. Doesn't mean we stop working. Doesn't mean we stop paying our bills. Doesn't mean that we get out of those things. But it is that we have another focus. Whatever the word has said that is to take place in this time, that has the preeminence. &gt;&gt; And we're a stranger to everything else. Hallelujah. When this flesh desires something or this uh we desire something that is outside and going to take us away from the main course of the word of God, deny it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There may be people that are listening on the internet. I don't know. I'm going to be very very straight. Myself personally, I moved to the city of Toronto. I didn't know anybody in that city of over 2 million about 2 and a2 million then and I don't know what the population is today. The first thing I did I won't say the very first thing but one of the first things I did is I opened up the telephone book and I went to the yellow pages and I started looking for the churches asking God help me. I got to have a place where I can go to church. I have to have a place where I can worship. I have to have a place when my family arrives where I can take them. &gt;&gt; And the first place I laid my finger on, the first place I went to, it actually wasn't in the yellow pages, I'm sorry, it was in the Toronto Sun newspaper. And I went to that place. I went to that church and there was about 400 people from Newfoundland there. And those people were as straight laced and gun barrel straight as you could want. And I was in that church. We were there until until we were put out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who said hallelujah? Sister Ruth Frederick, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Sounds like you may have had that kind of experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I better not get on to this because we want to come to communion. But I'll tell you what, I I was teaching this. I was teaching the senior Sunday school class. I was teaching the class of the young married couples which was the which the pastor had taught and and uh they'd asked me to take it so I said well fine okay and uh and uh I can't be even begin to tell you the whole thing but we were there and I was just in the foyer of the church getting ready to go one day and little we quiet brother he's just about like you brother David Law but your size and the way you're talking he said uh hey brother Bisco he said, "How how do you baptize?" Well, I didn't baptize anybody. I just church. He said, "How how do you baptize?" Well, I said, "Now that you asked me." I said, "I believe in baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Do you know what? That was just like dropping a bomb in that whole church. Why? That just went through there like a fire. And they sent they sent they sent the superintendent of the Sunday school over to me and said and he was all white and his lips was trembling and and his lips was trembling and he said, "Brother brother Piscll, I've been sent here on a terrible mission." I said, "You know, just relax. You know what can be so bad?" Oh, he said, "You you don't understand." I said, "No, no, it's it's all right. Just relax, Brother Ralph. You know what is it?" He said, "I've been asked I've been asked to have you resign." Oh. I said, 'Well, that's no problem. He said, 'How can you take it like that? And my wife was fixing supper and I said, "Well, let's have dinner." So, we had I think we had a dinner together or something. And he just couldn't even grasp it. But you know, you know what the Lord spoke to my heart? You believe God speaks? &gt;&gt; He told me, "Go right back there to church." the very next Sunday. &gt;&gt; And before that Sunday rolled around, all kinds of things had come back. And I had other brothers visit my house and they're ready to put up a fight. You know, they can't do this to you. They can't put you out. You stand up there and fight. I said, "No, no, Brother Joe. I'm not going to do that." Wasn't Brother Joe Walner, but his name was Brother Joe. No. I said, "No, not going to do that. But he said in my heart, "You go right back." And uh Sunday morning, just as regular as clockwork, we walked in the double doors and walked down the aisle. And I'll tell you what, if they had false teeth, they're ready to lose them right then. Their mouths just felt couldn't believe. Here we were just walking in. Walked right down where we always walk in. Sat down. sat right in our our seat and my class had gone back to the pastor who'd had it before. And uh so I filed up when the when the preliminaries closed. Well, I we filed up my wife and I and we happened to be kind of the last of the line. Everybody got up and the whole the whole large room where where this class was seated was all filled except the front seats. The just the front seats right in front. So, we were sitting right here and the pastor was so close. The pastor was about this close to us. I felt so sorry for him. I really did. I loved him dearly. And we would and we would get together and talk about Brother Brandham's message. He told me the greatest meetings I ever been in was in Brother Brandham's meetings down near Detroit in Flint, Michigan. I believe he was there in Windsor, Ontario. He's in those meetings. He said, "They're so outstanding." I said, 'Brother Ripley, we'd go fishing together. I said, 'Brother Ripley, why don't you just kick this whole denomination over in the ditch? And why don't you just forget the whole thing? And I was talking to him and his wife, and his name was Edgar, Ed Edgar Edwin or something. And and uh and his wife says, "Edwin, remember our pension?" The pension wasn't meaning to him. And as we sat there and his lips began to tremble terribly and he couldn't hardly get the words out, he said, "We will read the scripture text. We'll read it all together." I didn't know what the scripture text was cuz I wasn't teaching the class anymore. And they opened up the scripture text and guess what it was? I give it to you by memory. And they accused him of many things. And he answered them not a word. [Applause] I just had to do believe I tell you the son of man was growing. He was increasing little by little but I'm glad I had enough for that moment and I had been accused of many things but I never said a word. I got a I you know, brother George DST and Sister Felina with their kids were sitting in that same church while we were there. Only trouble was we had two different leadings. They sat on one side of the church, we sat on the other side of the church. We didn't even know it till all these years later and here they come here and we found out we sat in the same church. But that pastor, Brother Ripley, sent me a letter about seven pages and told me, he says, "Brother Ed, I never felt more comfortable than when I was away and had the had you in the pulpit to take my place. I was never so comfortable." And he told me, "I have left that organization and I am independent now." I thank God. He was a wonderful man. and I really appreciated him. But oh, I'm so glad, friends. I'm glad even though you got put out even though he got rejected. Was it easy? No, it was one of the hardest things of our lives. And there I just had a young family, you know, we're trying to find another place. I said, "We got to go to church." I don't know how desperate you are. We got to go to church and worship. The next Sunday, we drove up to a church. We're going to go to church now. We've been there. Now we're going to go to another church. just I don't know, just a church in the area. We drive up to the church and you're not going to believe this, but you will after I tell you, there's a a dog uh a compound animal compound vehicle right in front of the church and a man was just getting out with a great big net or something and he was going to catch I said, "What are you doing?" He says, "I'm going to catch a dog." and he was up on the church steps going to catch this dog. And I'm going up the steps. I thought, "This is strange. We're trying to go to church. Here's a here's a dog catcher going to catch a dog." And we're just getting up on the steps and there's a big sign on the door. Meetings canled. Something went off wherever it was. And I said to my wife, "That's it. God's already told us. We just go back home." And we just started having services back home. And I'm happy to say that brother who asked me how we baptized and all the others that caused the whole stir, they're in a messy church today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We all have a cross. Brother Jake Dick, where are you? I want Brother Jake as we're getting ready for the communion now. Sorry. Was it all right to take this time? I want Brother Jake Dick to come and uh a song been on my heart all week and is going to lead us right into the communion now. And the song is uh take up thy cross and follow me. I hear the blessed savior say. And I don't know if they have the words to it to put it on the screen. You won't be singing it, but just listen to the words as uh brother Jake and whoever I left it to him to choose who would sing together. Oh, it's a beloved time, friends. It's a wonderful time. I'm just wanting to have these words for you. How many know that old song? Of course, I'm sure there's many of you. I want especially these words have a special meaning and whoever was inspired to write this song wrote it from the perspective of that he he encountered the Lord and they're a stranger journey too. Then in the second verse I cried Lord Jesus and he spoke my name. I saw his hands all bruised and torn. I stooped to kiss away the marks of shame, the shame for me that he had borne. "Oh, let me bear thy cross, dear Lord," I cried. And lo, a cross for me appeared. "The one forgotten, I had cast aside, the one so long that I had feared. Let us not fear the cross. Let's deny ourselves and follow him." Amen. God bless you as you say. [Music] I walked one day along a country road and there a stranger journey too. [Music] stand low beneath the burden of his love. It was a cross, a cross I knew. Take up thy cross and follow me. I hear the blessed Savior call. How can I make a lesser sacriice when Jesus gave his all? I cried, Lord Jesus. And he spoke my name. I saw his hands all bruised and torn. I stooped to kiss away the marks of shame, the shame for me that he had borne. &gt;&gt; Take up thy cross and follow me. I hear the blessed Savior call. How can I make a lesser sacriice when Jesus gave his all? [Music] Oh, let me bear thy cross, dear Lord, I cry. And lo, a cross for me appear. The one forgotten I had cast aside. the one so long that I had fear. &gt;&gt; Take up thy cross and follow me. &gt;&gt; I hear the blessed savior call. How can I make a lesser sacriice when Jesus gave his cross I'll carry till the crown appears the way I journey soon we where God himself shall wipe away all tears and friend. Hold fellowship with friend. &gt;&gt; Take up thy cross and follow me. [Music] I hear the blessed savior call. [Music] How can I make a lesser sacriice when Jesus came? &gt;&gt; We're going to have you sing the chorus another time or two. I'm going to ask the deacons to come forward now if you would please as we approach the Lord's table. And this is the cross. I trust I was able to make myself clear in the services today. The bread that we'll be taking and the cup that we'll be drinking of. We are testifying in so doing that that life is here now tonight living in us. And I sought to describe that life what God allowed it to go through. And I say Lord Jesus whatever tomorrow holds you'll give me the strength, the stamina, the wisdom, whatever I need to live your life, not mine, your life. Amen. Take up thy cross and follow me. Take up thy cross. [Music] I hear the blessed savior. How can I make a lesser sacriice when Jesus is all take up my cross and follow me? I hear the blessed savior call. [Music] How can I make a sacriice when Jesus gave his all? &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Jake, brother Peter, sister Brenda. reading our scripture in 1 Corinthians 11 and 23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you. And I'd like you to notice very closely the next line in conjun in connection with the services today. It spoke to me so directly this afternoon that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread. He was still giving this is my body. &gt;&gt; In the same night that he was betrayed &gt;&gt; he took bread. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Said this is my body. And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." And after the same manner also, he took the cup, and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood, this do ye, as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself. And so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. And for this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together under condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together together to eat, tar one for another. I'll have you just bow your head for a moment. I felt to do this before the brethren break the bread and before they pray over the bread. I'd like to just take a moment of silence now. Each one, let us examine our heart in light of the word that God laid on my heart for these services. Let us see ourselves in the light of what God would want us to be. And I know we may not measure up to that standard. We're not to set our own standard. But I'd like you to examine your heart. And if there's anything there that would be a miss with any family member, anyone within the church, anyone where you work or within your realm of association outside in the world that we would take the admonition of the word of God and as the prophet spelled it out so clearly, from our heart we forgive them and from our heart we hold nothing in our heart against anyone. Oh Lord Jesus, let the Holy Spirit now seek out and search every area of our heart. Lord turn on the great search light. Create in us, oh God, clean heart. Wash us with the water of the word as you have this day. We thank you for it. Thank you for this time now Lord before your table. Wonder Brother Don White would you ask the blessing upon and give thanks for the bread before it is broken. Gracious heavenly father, how he humbles us, Lord, to think, oh Lord, the one who created the heavens and the earth, the universe should so humble himself that he should become flesh to dwell among us to take the penalty of our sin upon you. Lord, we can only say, oh Lord, that we love you with all of our heart. those things that brother Ed spoke this morning. Oh Lord, when you declared, oh Lord, that it is finished and it was finished for a purpose that it would become life in your bride, Lord. May every aspect of your redemptive blessings, oh Lord, be uh manifest in your bride, Lord. Oh God, we just love you. We just, Lord, want to serve you with all of our hearts, oh God. Just ask, Father, as we partake of the bread this evening, how we think, oh Lord, that your body was broken for us, Lord, broken for our healing, broken for every redemptive blessing that we could partake of and enjoy, Lord. And we just thank you this evening, oh Lord. Just ask, Father, that you would bless the people as they partake of the bread now, Lord. We love you and we give you praise and thanks in Jesus Christ's lovely name. Amen. Maybe brethren, break the bread. As as you receive the bread for those of you that are uh perhaps visiting, we don't have a closed communion. If you are born again believer, you've believed on Lord Jesus Christ for your salvation, your redemption. We don't have, as the prophet said, we don't have a close communion. The communion is for the believers. If you would hold anything in your heart against anyone, then don't take it. Don't don't don't eat and drink damnation to yourself. But the scripture says that we wait on one another or we make those things right and we just ask God forgive us and then so let him eat. The scripture says that's what God intends for us to do. I would like to have you sing with me while the bread is being passed and you'll hold it and we'll all partake of it together. Lest I forget thine agony, lest I forget Gethsemane. Uh I wonder if we could just have that. [Music] I like to sing the verse, please. King of my life, I crown thee now. King of my life. I crown [Music] shall adore me. Lest I forget my ground. Lead me to essentially le I forget and le I forget my [Music] le I forget my glory. Lead me to calary. [Music] Show me the tomb where thou tender. Angels ro [Music] I forget [Music] le I forget thy and le I forget thy love for me. Lead me to Calary. &gt;&gt; I'll just allow you to have your seat now while the brethren are passing the bread through. It'll be a little bit easier and we'll go on with the song. Let me like Mary through the womb. Come with a gift to me. Oh sh [Music] me to calary [Music] I forget [Music] I forget myity. and I forever love for me to calary. &gt;&gt; I'll have the congregation together. We will read these this next verse together. May I be willing, Lord, to bear daily my cross for thee, even thy cup of grief to share, thou hast borne all for me. Lest I forget. [Music] And lest I forget thy le I forget thy love for me. Lead me to cal. [Music] Fill me on. Lord, fill me, oh Lord, with thyire for all who know [Music] and smil to speak of calary. [Music] Yes, I forget. [Music] I forget my le I forget my love for me. Lead me to Calary. &gt;&gt; When I survey the wondrous cross, [Music] these are such marvelous words in these songs. So appropriate for this time. [Music] You sense his presence. It's always a sweet presence. I just urge you now. We don't do this as some formality, but we do this in reality. It's a real experience. And you don't have to remember everything that was preached today, but if you would just say, Lord, what you inspired brother to speak, what you inspired him to speak, let it be my portion. Let that Christ that is in me increase, my friend. My precious brothers and sisters, you want to know what's in the inside of my heart right now? What I prayed for? Don't let the people leave at the same level they came in. Let them be determined and let them confess with their lips from the youngest to the eldest, God live in me. If those saints back there could have that force and that desire within them prior to the when the tree was planted on the day of Pentecost, that bride tree, if they could have that back there, surely now it is my portion at this late hour. How many believe it's harvest time? Amen. &gt;&gt; And the messenger said, "The fruit ripens at the top of the tree, at the very top of the tree, at the very end time." And that's where we are. Oh my brother, my sister, I declare with everything that's in me, I believe that the sun of righteousness is shining upon our soul, upon this body of Jesus Christ, this bride body. And we are I'm coming against every force of the enemy that would try to put a doubt in your mind or or cause you to believe a lie or cause you to be wearied with your walk with God. I want you to set it aside. &gt;&gt; I don't have to live where I lived before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Believe it. &gt;&gt; I'm challenging you in the name of Jesus Christ. Believe it. I don't have to go out of here the way I came in. Amen. I want an increase of the life of the son of man, Jesus Christ, the second Adam. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] That's where the dawn [Music] cross [Music] on which the prince of glory died. My richest gain I count by loss and for contempt. all my cry for it long that I should boast save the Christ my God all the way that coming. I sacrifice them to his blood.

Earth to be my all I [Music] glory [Music] I only to be Let us close our eyes as we sing it again. To me Jesus. [Music] To me Jesus. [Music] All I [Music] to [Music] be like him.

Once again, just make me like, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; me like [Music] me that fil with and make me more like [Music] sincerely with deep sincer sincerity sacred moment that we've entered into. I want this to be a different time for us. May the Son of Man increase as never before in each of our lives. And when he'd given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." We'll partake together. [Music] And after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. And when you receive it, I would like you to be mindful." Said, "This is the New Testament, the entire New Testament in his blood, which was shed and spilled, and the life of it now is here." When you hold that cup and you partake of it, You're testifying that life has entered into me. I wonder brother Don Alexander if you would just pray. Please ask a blessing upon the people and join with me if each of you will please let's join our hearts together. Lord let this be a special moment and this as we partake together. Blessed Savior, Lord, as we gather tonight, Lord, and have come together in in remembrance and in honor of your sacrifice for us, your redemption to us, Lord. And we just come now, Father, recognizing that your life among us was God's own life, the life that we longed for and could never attain to, Father. and that you have made it available to us, Lord, so so far beyond our ability sometimes to believe that you love us that much, but you do. And you have told us again and again. And Father, we just accept your love, Lord. We accept your mercy. We accept your redemption and your promises, Lord. and pray you'll strengthen us, Father, as you bring to a close your great salvation, Lord, wrapping up, Lord, the events that you have laid out in your word, knowing that we're so close to the last steps, Lord, that we just pray you'll bless everything that we've heard today, Lord, and bring it to life, bring it to fruition for your name's sake, for your glory and honor, Lord, we ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Music] When you receive the cup, you just partake of it as soon as you feel ready. God bless you. Hallelujah. [Music] What we're doing now is remembering Calvary. We can sing that as we receive the cup. [Music] I remember Calvary 2201. Where he may lead me, I will go. Where he may lead me, I will go. For I remember to trust him so and I remember for me that he was slain on Calary. Jesus shall lead me night. Jesus shall lead me all the way.

Those of you that have not participated in footwashing before, if you have not, it's a wonderful experience and you may you may just observe if you need to, but I would participate if I were you if you want to get the full blessing of it because this what the Lord Jesus did and said. And the supper being ended and the devil having now put in the heart of Judas's Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him. And Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands. This is John the 13th chapter verse three. And that he was come from God and went to God. He riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself. After that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded. This is a very determined act that our Lord has done. Laid aside, he riseth from supper. One laid aside his garments. Two, he took a towel. Three, he girded himself. Four, he poured water into a basin. Five, he washed the disciples feet. Six, and he wiped them. Seven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This was no accident. &gt;&gt; He was setting out a great example. And he said, he said it was an example. And he said, "Then cometh to Simon Peter." And Peter sa said unto him, "Lord, dust thou wash my feet?" Jesus answered and said unto him, "What I do, thou what I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter?" Peter saith unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me." And Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus said to him, "He that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet, but is clean every wit. And ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him. Therefore said, he are not all clean." So after he had washed their feet, and had taken their garments, he and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I've done unto you? You call me Master and Lord?" And you say, "Well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet, not for the dirt of the path in Palestine, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That isn't what he was doing. This was after supper. &gt;&gt; They were already refreshed, but this was after supper. And he said, "What I have done, you do to one another." &gt;&gt; That can't get any clearer. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you washed one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. And we say Lord Jesus and we are doing them &gt;&gt; and we will do it tonight &gt;&gt; in prayer. Gracious father who sent forth our Lord Jesus Christ who has left us such a clear and glowing and wonderful example. Bless your people Lord. The service has lingered but it's never too long. We're going to wait on one another. wash one another's feet. Bless the sisters, Lord, as they go and the brethren to the fellowship room. And I pray, oh God, that as we return to the sanctuary for a closing moment of prayer, I pray that you will grace every room, every place where the people are. Grace it with a holy presence as though Lord you were present here and you are watching and observing what we are participating in now we thank you that we have this opportunity. It is a privilege Jesus in your name. Amen. Amen. As the brethren will make their way please. And then soon as you're done don't visit if you would just come back because we're going to close. the sisters. I wonder if you know you sisters that have been around, you senior sisters and all, if you would please just make sure that everyone is taken care of. Thank you. God bless you. [Music] Hallelujah.
