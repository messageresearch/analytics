[0:04] [music]
[0:05] [singing]
[0:12] [music]
[0:15] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to have our brother
[0:18] John Andy's come and [music] greet us in
[0:21] the new year. Amen. And open the service
[0:23] in a word of prayer if you'd just come,
[0:24] brother [music] John.
[0:27] &gt;&gt; And let's just welcome the Lord today.
[0:29] Amen.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we just want to lift up
[0:32] our hearts, God, and rejoice. We want to
[0:35] thank you, God, for this marvelous new
[0:37] year that's out before us, Lord. As Paul
[0:40] said, forgetting those things that are
[0:42] behind. We press toward the mark of the
[0:45] high calling, reaching [music] forward
[0:47] for those things that are before. God,
[0:49] we want to just lift up our hands
[0:51] together as individuals and collectively
[0:54] and just worship your holy name. God,
[0:56] [music]
[0:57] we want our gifts, Lord, to be in
[0:59] unison, be in one mind and one accord,
[1:02] Lord. Lord, we're not here for New
[1:04] Year's resolutions, but we [music] want
[1:07] to rededicate ourselves, reconsecrate
[1:10] ourselves, Lord. We want to with a
[1:13] renewal passion for your [music]
[1:15] presence and for your people. We want to
[1:17] lift up our hands and surrender, God.
[1:20] Ask you to move freshly upon our
[1:22] assembly, Lord, upon our ministry, Lord,
[1:25] upon every brother and sister, our
[1:27] families, Lord, that are gathering. Some
[1:29] are are grieving. Some are under great
[1:31] loss. [music]
[1:32] Some are sick among us. Some are looking
[1:35] for decisions, Lord, that are heavy on
[1:37] their minds and in their hearts. But
[1:40] Lord, we serve a great God, Lord, and
[1:42] we're here to bear one another's
[1:44] burdens. I pray that we would roll back
[1:46] the scales, Lord, from our our our our
[1:49] natural senses and look into the word
[1:51] today. Help us to rejoice as a people.
[1:54] Help us to be glad, God, and thankful as
[1:57] we look around the room and realize
[1:59] there's miracles that are standing here,
[2:01] God, lives that are redeemed. Today, we
[2:04] want to worship you. We just want to
[2:07] lift up the hands of one another, too,
[2:09] Lord, as just we're crossing the finish
[2:11] line. We're coming into another day,
[2:14] into another season. [music] I pray,
[2:16] God, you'd give us great revelation
[2:18] today. Let our hearts be warmed
[2:20] [clears throat and music] as we want to
[2:21] thank you for the service last night.
[2:23] God, still under the impact, [music]
[2:25] Lord, of your token life that's flowing
[2:28] through the body. We just pray for one
[2:30] another. And I'm sure there's [music]
[2:31] needs, there's unspoken requests, Lord,
[2:34] all over the building, out across the
[2:36] internet, lives that are connected with
[2:39] [music] us. pray a blessing on the bride
[2:41] today, God. This new January 1st,
[2:44] [music] I pray that throughout the land,
[2:46] there'd be a great surge of the
[2:48] anointing of God as we look for the
[2:50] coming of the Lord. Gross darkness on
[2:53] the people, but a great light has shone.
[2:56] God, use our pastor today, God, and to
[2:59] minister a message of shalom to us. A
[3:02] rapture message, a leaving this world
[3:05] message, Lord, future home message,
[3:08] Lord, that our theophanes AND US COULD
[3:11] FELLOWSHIP [music] very closely in the
[3:13] house of God today. Let us rejoice, God,
[3:16] in the singing. Rejoice in the prayers.
[3:19] Rejoice in the word and the testimonies
[3:22] as we celebrate your victory in our
[3:24] lives. [music] Take control of this
[3:27] afternoon's meeting. We give it to you,
[3:29] Lord, and we love you, God. Your
[3:31] appearing is so wonderful. [music] Your
[3:34] presence would just make the difference
[3:36] throughout this whole year and every
[3:38] part of our lives. Just your nearness,
[3:41] that supernatural nudge. God, [music]
[3:43] bless every soul. Lord, in Jesus name.
[3:47] Amen.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we're standing, let's sing
[3:54] together. Blessed assurance, Jesus is
[3:56] mine. [music] We're going to hear the
[3:58] choir again, the song that they sang
[4:00] last night. So maybe they can be [music]
[4:01] coming as we're singing this together.
[4:06] Blessed [music]
[4:07] are
[4:11] Jesus [music]
[4:12] [singing] is mine.
[4:17] Oh [music] what [singing] a foraste
[4:22] of glory [singing]
[4:23] divine.
[4:27] I'm an air of [music and singing]
[4:28] salvation,
[4:33] [music] purchased [singing] of God,
[4:37] [music] born of his [singing] spirit,
[4:43] washed [music] in his blood.
[4:48] This [music and singing] is my story.
[4:52] Oh, this is [music]
[4:54] my song. [singing]
[4:58] We're praising myior
[5:01] [music]
[5:04] all [singing] the day long.
[5:09] This is my song.
[5:13] [music and singing]
[5:13] Oh, this is my song.
[5:19] Praising [music and singing]
[5:20] my Savior
[5:25] all the day long.
[5:29] [music]
[5:30] Amen. Why don't you have your seats this
[5:32] morning?
[5:34] [music]
[5:56] God bless you
[5:58] know the Lord Jesus and give you a
[6:00] little uh just background behind this
[6:02] song. Um I first heard it um a while ago
[6:07] but I had forgotten about it and I just
[6:08] had kind of this melody in the back of
[6:10] my head and I looked it up on my iPod
[6:12] and began to listen to the lyrics of
[6:13] this song. how deep the father's love
[6:15] for us. And brother David, if you could
[6:16] have the lyrics maybe on both screens
[6:18] for the choir and the people to follow
[6:19] along with. I was so blessed by the
[6:22] lyrics of this song. And the title, how
[6:25] deep the father's love for us, only
[6:27] really happens as the first line of the
[6:29] song, but the entire song essentially
[6:33] relays that. How deep the father's love
[6:35] for us as it goes through the
[6:36] crucifixion and the place that it's put
[6:39] us in since then. And so I would just
[6:42] ask that you would just keep that in
[6:44] your mind how deep the father's love for
[6:45] us as you listen to these lyrics because
[6:47] we've been incredibly blessed even in
[6:48] our practices as we've sung this song
[6:50] and the anointing last night was just
[6:52] incredibly powerful behind it. And so
[6:54] we'd invite you if you know it you can
[6:56] sing along with us and uh that it would
[6:58] just be a blessing to you and throughout
[7:00] this new year whatever you face that you
[7:01] would just remember how deep his love is
[7:03] for us. Amen. God bless you all. We
[7:06] appreciate you.
[7:27] How deep [music and singing] the
[7:28] Father's love for us.
[7:32] I'll ask [music and singing] beyond no
[7:35] measure
[7:38] that [music and singing] he should give
[7:40] his only son
[7:43] to make [music and singing] a wretch his
[7:46] treure.
[7:48] How [singing] great the pain of searing
[7:51] [music]
[7:52] loss.
[7:54] The [singing] father turns his face away
[7:59] as [music and singing] wounds which mar
[8:01] the chosen one
[8:04] bring many [singing] sons to gloryy.
[8:20] Behold [music and singing] the man upon
[8:23] a cross.
[8:25] I [music and singing] s upon his
[8:27] shoulders.
[8:30] Ashamed [singing]
[8:31] I hear the mocker's voice.
[8:35] Call [music and singing] out among the
[8:38] sters.
[8:41] It [singing] was my sin that held him
[8:44] there [music]
[8:46] until [singing]
[8:47] it was a complace.
[8:51] His dying [music and singing] breath has
[8:54] brought me life.
[8:56] I know that [music and singing]
[8:58] it is.
[9:01] How deep, [music and singing]
[9:02] how deep,
[9:07] how deep, [music and singing] how deep.
[9:09] Yeah.
[9:12] [music]

[9:29] Heat. [music]
[9:47] &gt;&gt; [music]
[10:02] &gt;&gt; How [music and singing] great the Wolf
[10:04] that God did spend
[10:07] to come [singing]
[10:08] where I lay helpless. [music]
[10:12] Through tears [singing] I see his
[10:14] outstretched hand
[10:17] as [music] he declares [singing] meless.
[10:22] How great the love that s me out.
[10:26] [singing and music]

[10:29] his mercy. [music and singing]

[11:40] heart.
[11:42] His [music] words have been my son.

[25:08] why? Oh, why I'm so happy?
[25:12] [music and singing]
[25:14] For I accepted

[25:19] of the Lord.
[25:22] [music]
[25:23] [singing]
[25:24] The redee
[25:26] [music]

[25:56] was freedom to you and I for the
[26:00] [singing]
[26:02] word
[26:04] that was [music]
[26:08] [singing]
[26:10] hallelujah.
[26:12] Oh, if we just lift it up one more time.
[26:15] Oh, [music]

[26:54] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful day.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; And so nice to see so many of you here.
[26:59] Wonderful way to start the new year.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I shook hands with a lot of people
[27:04] twice today.
[27:06] I think you did too probably. And uh so
[27:10] it's nice to be in church twice
[27:14] &gt;&gt; same day. God bless you. I'll just let
[27:16] you have your seats for a few moments.
[27:20] And uh [clears throat]
[27:23] I have to take a little bit of time. We
[27:24] have you know the church here from its
[27:28] very very beginnings.
[27:30] And when we say its very beginnings, we
[27:32] talk about the house. Uh we always tried
[27:36] to reach out. Reach out to somebody,
[27:40] reach out to whoever
[27:43] uh just see who might be interested in
[27:46] hearing the things that we not the
[27:50] things that we believe, the things that
[27:51] have done so much for us.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; The word is a person.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; And I want you to remember that phrase
[27:57] throughout today's service. A word is a
[28:00] person.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; As I say, especially the young people,
[28:04] young men, young ladies, uh, and to
[28:08] those of you that may be
[28:10] under the sound of my voice today out in
[28:13] the,
[28:14] uh, out in the internet, on the
[28:17] telephone, and there are many, it would
[28:19] it would surprise you. I've gone over,
[28:23] not frequently, but once in a while I
[28:25] just go over how many people have have
[28:28] uh uh been logging on and listening to
[28:31] the service. And in between the archive
[28:35] of a week and the live streaming of the
[28:39] service, some of one one just two three
[28:42] weeks ago was up over 600 locations.
[28:46] uh you just put a couple people with
[28:48] each of that and sometimes there's many
[28:50] more but that's a lot of people that are
[28:54] are you know they're part of the service
[28:56] and they feel a part of you but I want
[28:59] also I'm saying some of these things for
[29:01] their benefit and that is the the
[29:04] congregation here has always been
[29:06] connected to the world
[29:09] and what happened was if you've not
[29:12] heard it before as we reached out
[29:15] whether was just handing out a tape or
[29:18] or a track or a message book or whatever
[29:22] it was. Then that person when they
[29:25] became interested, they struck if
[29:27] something struck their heart, then
[29:29] that's the place that they reached back
[29:31] in [clears throat] say, "Well, we need
[29:33] we need to uh I'd like to hear more."
[29:37] And uh I I just have a testimony here
[29:40] that I'll probably give just a little
[29:42] bit later on and it's out of Uganda and
[29:46] you just wouldn't believe. I mean those
[29:48] of you that were here last night and
[29:49] heard brother uh Larga Jonathan well you
[29:54] know he was here in this church and he
[29:56] was just a young man probably in his
[29:58] late teens at that time and you know
[30:01] they use anything like he said we use
[30:03] Facebook or whatever more. this brother
[30:05] in Uganda, he's doing the same thing at
[30:08] a on a different scale. And the people
[30:10] that they're contacting is just so many
[30:14] and uh uh I I just so many things that
[30:17] are on my heart, but I'm happy very in
[30:20] fact is I feel rewarded and thrilled
[30:23] that we can take this prophet's message,
[30:26] &gt;&gt; put it in the hands of somebody else,
[30:28] &gt;&gt; and then have them meet the person of
[30:31] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; That's the key.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to the people here
[30:37] that
[30:39] uh you you're sitting besides people
[30:40] that you know and others in the church
[30:43] and you've shaken hands with them. But
[30:45] to know him whom to know is life
[30:48] eternal. You you may be made known to
[30:51] him through the Bible, through the
[30:53] preaching or some other way. But he is a
[30:58] person
[30:59] &gt;&gt; and that is who you come to know. And
[31:02] once you've met him, you know that
[31:04] you've met him.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; You don't go on down the road and forget
[31:08] that you met him. You know that you met
[31:10] him
[31:11] &gt;&gt; and and a relationship is set up.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Uh someone has gone to meet the Lord in
[31:20] a in a way he had not perhaps expected.
[31:23] But Sister Karen Ashdown's brother
[31:26] passed away yesterday.
[31:28] yesterday in the wee hours of the
[31:30] morning 12:38
[31:32] a.m. Uh it was uh yeah I believe it was
[31:36] yesterday wasn't it yesterday
[31:40] and you know God does little special
[31:42] things. I hadn't seen him for some time
[31:45] and I was I had to actually deliver some
[31:48] documents and I was driving down 6 96th
[31:52] Avenue [clears throat] and just gone
[31:54] past the hospital and the building that
[31:57] uh Lyall Ficken was in was on the left
[32:01] hand side and I couldn't turn left and I
[32:03] thought I should stop in and see Lyall
[32:06] and brother Lyall I hadn't seen him now
[32:08] for some time [clears throat] and I
[32:10] thought well I need to get to the office
[32:12] and you that kind of a struggle sets up.
[32:15] And as I as I passed by the entrance, I
[32:17] couldn't turn left anyway because of a
[32:19] barricade. And so I went I went past a
[32:22] block and went past a second block. And
[32:25] I felt so bad at that time. I thought,
[32:29] well, I will just turn left here. And I
[32:31] turned and made a U-turn so I could come
[32:33] back out. And I thought, well, I'll text
[32:35] Sister Karen and find out if she's there
[32:38] or if any maybe it's a convenient time
[32:41] or inconvenient time. And anyway, make a
[32:44] long story short, she said, "I'm just
[32:46] leaving Cloverdale." And so we met there
[32:49] and uh uh I went up and was able to have
[32:53] an opportunity to speak to him a little
[32:56] bit, to speak to his wife, Martina, and
[32:59] then also to meet his daughter. his
[33:02] daughter was there and then have a
[33:03] little time uh just talking directly
[33:06] with him and uh spend a time with with
[33:10] sister Karen as well little knowing that
[33:12] within a few hours he would slip into
[33:15] eternity. Uh I want to tell you that
[33:18] from my own perspective
[33:21] this became a a major victory and you
[33:24] might say well why so? Well, because
[33:29] uh I I I a scripture came to me about
[33:34] three weeks ago, but even prior to that,
[33:36] as much as two months ago, while I was
[33:38] in Dallas, I had a very very specific
[33:42] experience with God, and I just took
[33:44] some time away uh while I was in the
[33:47] meetings, but I just cut myself off from
[33:50] everybody, stayed alone in the room, and
[33:53] did some fasting and prayer for a little
[33:57] while and and I thought I how can I fast
[34:00] when I'm in meetings but as I fasted I
[34:03] got stronger and it was just incredible
[34:06] and I would come through a 2-hour
[34:08] service and I felt better after the
[34:10] service than I felt before the service
[34:13] and I lost my all my desire for food and
[34:16] I was praying for Lyall and another
[34:19] gentleman that I'm praying for real
[34:21] earnestly and I just set myself aside
[34:24] they were on my mind all the time I just
[34:27] prayed whenever whenever I had a moment,
[34:29] I was just lifting them up in prayer and
[34:31] I said to the Lord, "Is it is it that
[34:35] you want to receive him? Is it that
[34:38] because you're not saying anything
[34:40] because you're not we're fully expecting
[34:42] him to walk out of the hospital, but is
[34:45] it that you want him more than you
[34:49] desire to even answer our prayers?" I
[34:51] know his desire to answer our prayers is
[34:54] great but you see we don't see the big
[34:57] picture and then we don't know if God
[35:00] restored a person to health what what
[35:02] would be the their future or what would
[35:04] be you know and and and and God comes to
[35:07] a place and he just decides you know he
[35:10] wants that individual with him and uh
[35:13] and uh I can say this and I will say it
[35:16] to the congregation to all and I'm not
[35:18] ashamed to say it through the faith of
[35:20] our Sister Karen Ashdown.
[35:24] She literally carried him into the
[35:26] presence of God with an undaunted,
[35:28] unmovable,
[35:30] unshakable faith to the last moment. But
[35:33] what I saw, I saw the man have a
[35:36] spiritual healing.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And maybe you might not
[35:41] understand my words, but in so doing, I
[35:45] see a I see a a sister right here in
[35:48] this congregation who absolutely carried
[35:52] her brother, carried him from, I would
[35:56] say perhaps a second rec resurrection
[36:01] before the judgment seat of God, the
[36:03] great white throne judgment, just
[36:05] carrying on and and living a good life
[36:08] in a church. but taking them out of that
[36:11] environment
[36:12] until all he was living on was what the
[36:15] message and and streaming the services
[36:18] and until a point I'm just going to say
[36:21] some personal things until a point where
[36:24] he was just uh uh he came to the
[36:27] realization that even others that were
[36:29] coming and visiting him just wasn't
[36:30] getting it. They're just not getting it.
[36:33] They just don't understand. And he
[36:35] because he had had an experience. And to
[36:38] me that's glorious. That's taking a
[36:41] person out of the general resurrection
[36:43] and putting them in the first
[36:44] resurrection.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That kind of faith.
[36:48] Hallelujah.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Taking them from waiting uh for the
[36:53] general resurrection to step right into
[36:55] a theophony body. That's what the
[36:57] message teaches us.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; And so we have another and and and so
[37:01] that's why I said it's a great victory.
[37:03] I wanted to say that to you. There are
[37:05] no no further announcements regarding a
[37:09] memorial services yet, but that will be
[37:12] made soon.
[37:14] I'm also, as I said last night, there
[37:16] was some greetings, but I I didn't have
[37:19] a whole list with me, but I want to
[37:21] greet you formally from brother Steven
[37:24] Ibali in Uganda in Compala, I think just
[37:28] out of Compala, Uganda. Uh these are
[37:30] brethren who spoke in the email and and
[37:33] so on. Brother Garrett Roald
[37:36] and brother Hank Dystra in Holland where
[37:39] we had services just uh two three weeks
[37:42] ago. Brother Albert in who's pastoring
[37:46] at uh the church in Gent in Gent uh
[37:50] Belgium. And that's where the Iverson
[37:53] family go and from the Iversons
[37:55] themselves. There's a young man. I'm
[37:58] going to give you some slides in a
[37:59] little bit, but he wants to sure to be
[38:01] greeted to you. He sl he streams almost
[38:04] all the meetings. We call him brother
[38:06] Bus. It's brother Busabosi and brother
[38:09] Victor Adam. He's the one who's had a
[38:12] lot of contact with him. Uh also brother
[38:15] Sergey from Moscow and brother Vladimmer
[38:19] from the Ukraine from Daesk in the
[38:23] Ukraine. And uh we want to remember
[38:26] these works in prayer also. I'm so I I
[38:30] feel humbled and I feel more than
[38:33] privileged to be able to know these
[38:36] brethren to be able to be connected with
[38:38] men. And these men are solid men who
[38:42] hunger and love the word of God just
[38:45] like you do. And those are men we want
[38:47] to really support.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; And while I'm on that subject, we'll
[38:51] have a brother here next Sunday. He has
[38:54] a church in Mexico City. I understand
[38:57] he's got quite an extensive work there.
[39:00] Brother Mark Aloo has had uh connection
[39:03] with him and brother uh Ron Caldwell has
[39:07] met him and knows him. Uh and uh so
[39:10] these brothers are going to be bringing
[39:12] him up. He'll be arriving next Friday on
[39:16] the 13th, but you won't see him Friday.
[39:18] gets in quite late and uh so I don't
[39:22] know just exactly all the arrangements,
[39:24] but he'll be here about a week and and
[39:26] so I've asked him to speak next Sunday
[39:29] night uh at at least and perhaps another
[39:32] service. We'll just see how that goes.
[39:35] And his name is Brother I don't know if
[39:38] I'm saying it exactly right. Uh Alwin,
[39:41] would that be close enough, brother Ron?
[39:46] Okay,
[39:47] &gt;&gt; stand up and say it louder.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Francisco
[39:53] City.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; All right, there you
[39:59] &gt;&gt; from the 13th. Pardon?
[40:01] &gt;&gt; He's coming in the 13th.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; He's coming in Friday the 13th, but
[40:04] he'll be here next Sunday.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Uh, the following Sunday. I'm sorry. I'm
[40:11] sorry. Thank you, Brother Ron. The
[40:12] following Sunday. That's right. Next
[40:15] Sunday, we're we're speaking a service
[40:18] for brother Danny
[40:20] uh down in Sarasota, Florida, Stevens.
[40:24] They're having an anniversary and uh I
[40:27] and my wife are supposed to be there for
[40:28] the anniversary. We have never been
[40:31] there, matter of fact, to speak. They've
[40:33] just asked us if we would speak that
[40:34] anniversary.
[40:36] Uh so and then the following Sunday,
[40:39] thank you brother Ron will be our
[40:42] brother from Mexico City.
[40:45] Amen.
[40:49] We have a greeting from brother Jacques
[40:52] in the Czech Republic and he just did a
[40:56] little short video clip. uh we have uh
[41:00] provided him through the brothers in
[41:03] Switzerland
[41:05] uh the a a hub printing station and now
[41:09] you'll see you might just think you know
[41:11] a little single hub printing station but
[41:14] you'll see what he's doing and and uh so
[41:17] can we have that video just now at this
[41:18] time and he he demonstrates what's
[41:21] happening how they handle it and then
[41:23] gives a word of greeting to the charge.
[41:34] We should have some audio.
[41:47] This is his two daughters.
[41:49] They're uh [clears throat]
[41:52] the one the one that's facing you is
[41:54] doing the printing and the folding, the
[41:58] collating and the folding.
[42:01] Um
[42:02] we should try to get the audio with this
[42:04] because he's he's explaining it. [cough]
[42:08] [clears throat]
[42:41] I'm sorry we haven't got that audio on.
[42:54] his greetings right at the end here
[42:57] anyway, but
[43:00] I appreciate the brothers getting the
[43:02] video part on, but we'd like to hear the
[43:05] audio as well.
[43:10] He did uh 10 new messages
[43:14] in this last year and he has been
[43:17] translating for almost 30 years.
[43:22] Uh
[43:24] no audio.
[43:26] Well,
[43:31] so the u
[43:36] the other part of this is he's just in
[43:38] the Czech Republic, but he he does the
[43:41] official when I say official because he
[43:44] translated for Voice of God for a number
[43:46] of years, but he also is a minister and
[43:49] a pastor and he couldn't do both at the
[43:52] same time, but they do several hundred
[43:55] messages of each of those messages which
[43:58] he does. And this is just one of the
[44:00] things that we attempt to do and to be a
[44:04] to be a uh uh reaching out. That's all
[44:07] part of our our our giving here from the
[44:10] church and all of those of you that give
[44:13] on the from the internet. Uh this is
[44:16] what is this is what is happening. Uh
[44:19] I'll just give you a few slides here and
[44:24] then
[44:36] okay this first slide here is
[44:42] just so I have it on the right.
[44:46] This is uh the young brother, brother
[44:49] Buster Bozi. here.
[44:54] Do we have a
[45:12] Okay,
[45:14] it's not a problem with equipment. We
[45:17] got so much equipment here. I don't know
[45:18] which one to take.
[45:20] This is brother Basaboosezi here and he
[45:24] has given us uh
[45:29] the slide is a little mixed up from from
[45:32] where I had
[45:35] I had his email.
[45:38] Um
[45:42] th this is a pastor of a church in
[45:44] Zimbabwe
[45:46] where he was down there in Harari and
[45:49] that church was started by brother
[45:51] Joseph Chakosi
[45:53] and uh then this is the brother and you
[45:57] want to remember him. This is someone we
[46:00] can really be praying for. Matimba, I
[46:03] believe would be the pronunciation of
[46:05] his name. And he just goes all over the
[46:08] country,
[46:10] all over the country bringing the
[46:12] message.
[46:13] And that's sometimes how he does it. He
[46:17] walks through the jungles.
[46:19] So this young brother Basaboosei, he's
[46:22] been emailing me and we've been in
[46:24] contact with each other since uh for
[46:27] about four years, since he was in
[46:29] university.
[46:37] And there there they're on a on a
[46:39] journey there. That's the brother that's
[46:41] doing the evangelistic work. He said
[46:42] he's just like an apostle setting up
[46:45] churches. And that's brother Basaboszi
[46:48] once again. And there they are in their
[46:51] journey.
[46:54] Uh
[46:55] and this is uh brother Matumba again,
[46:59] brother Basabosi and this is a deacon of
[47:01] another church and that's in a city I
[47:05] believe uh also in Zimbabwe.
[47:09] This is very interesting. I'll let you
[47:11] look at this while I tell you about it.
[47:15] Uh
[47:18] he said on Tuesday evening
[47:21] I was coming from uh somewhere I was
[47:23] walking besides the school where I saw a
[47:27] group of boys carrying out a discussion
[47:30] in a classroom.
[47:32] I was con convicted to go join them. Uh
[47:36] they were doing some mathematics.
[47:40] One of the boys gave me chalk for me to
[47:43] help them solve the problem.
[47:45] Uh from there what happened is almost
[47:48] unbelievable. We ended up having a Bible
[47:51] study service for about one hour.
[47:55] He says we talked on most of the
[47:58] important subjects and finally most of
[48:00] the boys asked for my mobile phone
[48:03] number uh for them to get to know more
[48:06] about the nuggets. What a mighty God we
[48:09] serve. And then he says more. Yesterday
[48:12] morning I was on a Facebook on on
[48:15] Facebook which I use primarily for
[48:18] evangelism
[48:19] and one young man older than me wrote me
[48:22] and he said he read on one of the
[48:24] websites I designed
[48:27] uh uh I designed and that he saw some
[48:30] studies on William Brham. He was a
[48:33] brother from a Pentecostal organization
[48:35] and lives in Kala Uganda.
[48:38] He then later pleaded pleaded with me
[48:41] that I tell him more about this man,
[48:43] William Brham.
[48:45] [clears throat and cough]
[48:47] Brother, it will surprise you that this
[48:50] brother listened to and believed every
[48:52] bit of what I told him.
[48:56] I explained it by the help of the Holy
[48:58] Ghost from Elijah who was raptured. Then
[49:01] the spirit of Elijah on Elisha on down
[49:05] to Malachi 3, Malachi 45 and 6,
[49:08] Revelation 10:7 and other scriptures.
[49:11] And I then started to talk about William
[49:13] Brandham's experiences from his birth in
[49:16] 1909 to his death in 1965 mostly about
[49:20] the 1933 and 1963 and when he was about
[49:25] uh when it when he was about 6 years
[49:28] etc. And the brother was amazed and he
[49:30] later told me he was he has never in his
[49:33] life heard such an explanation about
[49:36] brother Brham
[49:38] even though he had once heard about him
[49:40] while he was just doing his uh zero
[49:45] level studies in school. And isn't our
[49:48] God amazing?
[49:49] &gt;&gt; I think it's wonderful when you have a
[49:50] young man so full of it. He just goes by
[49:52] a school looking for every opportunity.
[49:55] So they as soon as they put that chalk
[49:56] in his hand, he felt in control.
[50:00] Hallelujah. And thank you. You can take
[50:03] that one off now. God bless you. Isn't
[50:06] he wonderful? [applause]
[50:12] [applause]
[50:13] All right. You ready for the word?
[50:17] &gt;&gt; All right. If you'll stand and we'll
[50:19] turn the lights up, please, for us.
[50:22] I would like to have you turn to the
[50:24] book of Acts.
[50:32] We'll wait.
[50:36] Um, first turn to the book of Hebrews if
[50:40] you would please. Uh, I'd like to turn
[50:43] to the 12th chapter.
[50:55] I'm going to begin reading at the 18th
[50:57] verse.
[51:01] And before we read, let us pray once
[51:03] again.
[51:06] Our gracious
[51:09] father,
[51:11] we are so privileged to address you as
[51:14] our father which art in heaven and to
[51:18] know that you're the God of Abraham, the
[51:20] God that made promise to him. You're the
[51:23] God that was faithful in fulfilling the
[51:26] promise, the God of Isaac and the God of
[51:28] Jacob.
[51:30] You're the God of the prophets who were
[51:33] moved by the Holy Ghost and they spake
[51:36] things they did not understand,
[51:38] had them written down for our learning
[51:41] and for our benefit, for our
[51:44] edification.
[51:46] Thank you, Lord Jesus. For you are the
[51:49] one that was sent from the very bosom,
[51:51] the logos of God. You came down and was
[51:55] made flesh. We thank you, Father. Thank
[51:58] you, Father, for giving us this great
[52:00] gift. And here today, we stand as a
[52:02] people redeemed by the blood of the lamb
[52:06] of God. Thank you, Father, for the Holy
[52:09] Ghost, the Holy Spirit that has come
[52:11] &gt;&gt; and has filled us individually, and
[52:13] we've all had our individual experience.
[52:15] And if there are any here who have not
[52:17] had it as yet and have not been filled
[52:20] and baptized with the Holy Spirit, may
[52:23] they be endued with the same power, the
[52:25] same spirit that came upon the apostles
[52:28] and the disciples. How we thank you for
[52:30] the messengers, oh God, that have each
[52:33] one in their age been faithful to their
[52:35] time, but the last one could not be a
[52:38] reformer, but must be a restorer of the
[52:41] word, a prophet indeed. We thank you,
[52:43] Father, for the prophecies that have
[52:45] been spoken and have been fulfilled when
[52:49] you have vindicated, oh God, the message
[52:51] which we believe. We're not here
[52:54] believing some idle tales or some
[52:56] mysticism, but we're here believing the
[52:58] word that you have sent. Oh God, I pray
[53:01] it'll our hearts will be marked and our
[53:04] minds branded and our souls affected in
[53:08] the name of Jesus Christ. Give liberty I
[53:10] pray to my speaking father and may you
[53:13] be the one that utters the words and the
[53:15] people receive it in a supernatural
[53:18] channel in Jesus name. Amen.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Start reading at the 18th verse.
[53:26] For ye are not come unto the mount that
[53:28] might be touched, and that burned with
[53:31] fire, nor unto the blackness, and
[53:33] darkness, and tempest, and the sound of
[53:36] a trumpet, and the voice of words, which
[53:40] voice they that heard intreated, that
[53:43] the word should not be spoken to them
[53:46] anymore. For they could not endure that
[53:48] which was commanded. And if so much as a
[53:52] beast touched the mountain, it shall be
[53:54] stoned or thrust through with a dart.
[53:57] And so terrible was the sight that Moses
[53:59] said, I exceedingly fear and quake.
[54:03] But we are come under the mount under
[54:05] Mount Zion, and under the city of the
[54:08] living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and
[54:10] to an innumerable company of angels, to
[54:13] the general assembly and church of the
[54:16] firstborn, which are written in heaven.
[54:18] Isn't that wonderful? Hallelujah. And to
[54:21] God, the judge of all, and to the
[54:23] spirits of just men made perfect. And to
[54:26] Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant.
[54:28] Praise the Lord. And to the blood of
[54:31] sprinkling, that speaketh better things
[54:33] than that of Abel. So that ye see that
[54:36] you refuse not him that speaketh. For if
[54:40] they escape not who refused him that
[54:42] spake on earth, much more shall not we
[54:46] escape, if we turn away from him that
[54:49] speaketh from heaven, whose voice then
[54:52] shook the earth, but now he hath
[54:54] promised, saying, Yet once more I shake
[54:57] not the earth only, but also heaven. And
[55:00] this word yet once more signifyth the
[55:03] removing of those things that are shaken
[55:06] as of things that are made, that those
[55:09] things which cannot be shaken may
[55:12] remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[55:15] which cannot be moved, let us have grace
[55:19] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[55:23] reverence and godly fear. For our God is
[55:26] a consuming fire.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:30] May God bless his word to our hearts as
[55:32] you have your seats.
[55:35] And while you've just sat down, I also
[55:37] want to welcome our brother Martin
[55:39] Warner and his wife. Brother Martin and
[55:41] your wife, why don't you stand? It's
[55:42] Sister Roxan, Doc Hoffman's sister. And
[55:46] so they've got good company. [applause]
[55:50] Brother Martin just came from uh came
[55:52] from meetings in Africa. And I'm sorry
[55:55] we didn't acknowledge you last night,
[55:57] Brother Martin. Forgive us. God bless
[55:59] you. Nice to have you here always. Our
[56:02] friendship has been long lasting over
[56:05] the years and we really appreciate that.
[56:09] I want to try to approach something that
[56:10] I don't know exactly how to approach and
[56:13] so I guess we've all been there at
[56:15] times. You want to say something you're
[56:17] not too sure how you want to say it. But
[56:20] uh uh sometimes you know in in the
[56:24] ministry you have to kind of get off
[56:26] into some areas that are uh difficult to
[56:32] define. You know you know what you want
[56:35] to say but how to say it is is is the
[56:38] problem. Uh
[56:41] I will just commence by saying uh
[56:43] because we've been reading the scripture
[56:46] and this verse in particular, see that
[56:49] you refuse not him that speaketh.
[56:52] Uh, for if they escape not who refused
[56:57] him that spake on earth, much more shall
[57:00] not we escape if we turn away from him
[57:02] that speaketh from heaven, whose voice,
[57:05] and this is where I want to come from,
[57:08] whose voice then shook the earth, and
[57:12] now he hath promised, saying, Yet once
[57:16] more, I shake not the earth only, but
[57:18] also the heaven. Now while I'm speaking
[57:21] today
[57:22] uh we all have
[57:26] uh different levels of understanding
[57:29] of the words that we speak. Once in a
[57:32] while a person may say a word and often
[57:35] I'm running into words that I don't
[57:38] completely understand. So I seek out the
[57:40] meaning of those words. uh and and so we
[57:44] all have different levels of meaning of
[57:47] of of the words. I want to I
[57:51] [clears throat] I want to take into an
[57:53] area today
[57:55] uh
[57:57] to deal with some things that you know
[57:59] have been a concern to me in the
[58:02] message. For example, we hear and read
[58:06] often in the message uh the word
[58:09] revelation. I want you to think about
[58:12] revelation because I want to speak to
[58:14] you on
[58:16] words and the voice of revelation.
[58:20] And you find people that say, well, oh,
[58:22] they h they've had a revelation and they
[58:25] walk for perhaps months or even years in
[58:28] the message and have every appearance of
[58:32] having a revelation
[58:34] and uh and and then on down the road
[58:36] someplace they and brother Doug
[58:39] Hendrickson last night, that was one of
[58:41] the things that was in his in his
[58:44] comments and it was very well taken. He
[58:47] he wondered and he had a burden and he
[58:48] felt we should never lose our uh
[58:51] compassion and and our desire to see
[58:54] them restored.
[58:56] I have difficulty with uh and I believe
[59:00] I agree with that with our brother Doug
[59:02] 100%. I have difficulty
[59:06] uh believing that someone who has a true
[59:10] revelation
[59:12] actually depart from a revelation.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; And so there's levels of no knowing the
[59:19] message. Brother Brandham's talked about
[59:20] the priest. He said he learned it
[59:24] &gt;&gt; and he knew it was right
[59:26] &gt;&gt; and he knew it was God's word, but he
[59:28] had learned it. He got it in the channel
[59:30] of learning. And I think if we just
[59:33] learned something, we might uh be in
[59:36] danger of unlearning it. Or if we just
[59:38] got convinced of it by someone who can
[59:41] really put the thing together, we might
[59:43] get convinced of something else from
[59:45] somebody else. We find someone that's
[59:48] more uh you know um more able, more
[59:52] gifted, more skilled, then we might get
[59:55] them to convince a person another way.
[59:59] But when you've had a revelation, I want
[1:00:01] to try to convey to you today
[1:00:05] that a revelation is actually the voice
[1:00:09] of God.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; And that the voice of God, if we go back
[1:00:13] to the beginning, the voice of God is
[1:00:15] not in in it's not a a word necessarily.
[1:00:19] It it won't be in any specific language.
[1:00:23] it is uh you it may come to you by
[1:00:27] hearing something in a specific language
[1:00:30] as and this I'll be coming to in detail
[1:00:33] as apostle Paul said when he was struck
[1:00:36] down he said he heard in the Hebrew
[1:00:40] tongue so now God spoke or he heard an
[1:00:44] utterance in the Hebrew tongue calling
[1:00:47] his name Saul Saul why persecutest thou
[1:00:51] me none of the other men heard those
[1:00:54] words. They indeed saw the light and
[1:00:57] they and but Paul fell to the ground and
[1:01:01] uh and that became the object of his
[1:01:04] worship. Now, I'm I'm going to kind of
[1:01:07] overemphasize something here just for
[1:01:10] the sake of jarring your thoughts into
[1:01:13] the channel where I want to go. Uh if we
[1:01:17] go right back to the very beginning when
[1:01:19] and God said, "Let there be light." I I
[1:01:22] I know that wasn't in English and I
[1:01:25] don't think it was in Hebrew and I don't
[1:01:27] think because the languages uh as they
[1:01:30] were known after Babel had not even come
[1:01:33] into existence at that time. So it's
[1:01:36] interesting for us to say and and God
[1:01:39] said let there be light. Then the Bible
[1:01:41] says also that and God spoke to Abram by
[1:01:46] vision. what Abram what kind of voice
[1:01:49] that was I do not know but I'm just
[1:01:53] laying all of that aside for a moment to
[1:01:55] say that there's one thing that is quite
[1:01:59] uh very very specific and certain and
[1:02:01] that is that when God has in the
[1:02:05] scripture when he spoke to Abraham and
[1:02:07] told him certain things I don't know
[1:02:09] even what kind of language and I doubt
[1:02:11] that there was a language because what
[1:02:14] can be spoken to The inner man
[1:02:18] is can be much clearer
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; than the language you know.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; You can see something and it becomes so
[1:02:27] vivid
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; and it becomes so personal
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; and you know it's you that he is being
[1:02:34] talked to
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; and you can hear it as though it's your
[1:02:38] name and it identifies you I'm talking
[1:02:40] to and it's not tomorrow. It's now I'm
[1:02:44] talking to you and I'm calling you and
[1:02:46] you feel so moved and called and and you
[1:02:49] you you know it's just specific.
[1:02:52] Sometimes he's spoken to people in such
[1:02:54] a way that it's it's now and this won't
[1:02:57] even be tomorrow.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Some have told me I've heard like I
[1:03:01] heard the voice of God and I knew right
[1:03:03] then it if I if I left it or if I if I
[1:03:07] tried to postpone it this was my last
[1:03:10] chance. They've known that. How does it
[1:03:13] come so specific? It's you I'm talking
[1:03:15] to. This is the in this is the person.
[1:03:18] He knows all about the life. And then
[1:03:20] and then the one thing for sure that
[1:03:23] happens, I've noticed that when the men
[1:03:26] in the Old Testament and in the New when
[1:03:28] they actually got a revelation of who
[1:03:30] that person was,
[1:03:33] what followed almost immediately was
[1:03:36] worship.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so because there was no sound
[1:03:43] or no words or there may have been but
[1:03:45] we don't have a specific record of it
[1:03:48] but then as soon as the revelation came
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; I will say it that is true revelation
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; then that individual begins to worship
[1:04:01] at the level of that revelation.
[1:04:04] in fact is as the prophet said, the
[1:04:07] message and the messenger are the same
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; and they're they're the same. You can't
[1:04:13] really separate them.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; And so a person ends up,
[1:04:18] you'll excuse my phrase right now, but
[1:04:20] you end up worshiping your revelation.
[1:04:26] Now,
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; it's it's good that you stop to think
[1:04:30] about that because I've been thinking
[1:04:31] about this for a lot of days.
[1:04:35] And now we're going to go into some
[1:04:36] scripture.
[1:04:38] But you see, God would speak to Abram in
[1:04:41] a vision and then you see him build an
[1:04:44] altar
[1:04:46] and worship.
[1:04:48] Now, there's people today that are
[1:04:51] assembled in churches throughout the
[1:04:54] entire earth.
[1:04:56] And each of those churches are
[1:04:59] representative
[1:05:01] of a certain document
[1:05:04] or a faith, a document of faith. And
[1:05:07] they say, "This is what we believe." And
[1:05:10] so the people are there and whatever
[1:05:14] form of worship they take, it might be a
[1:05:17] very relaxed form, it might be uh it
[1:05:21] might be a very uh severe form or a very
[1:05:25] precise form or very traditional form or
[1:05:28] whatever more. But what they're really
[1:05:30] saying is that what has been spoken,
[1:05:33] what is in word form that this edifice
[1:05:38] represents, that is who we're
[1:05:40] worshiping. And thus it becomes
[1:05:43] idolatry.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; That's why God said, "Don't make any
[1:05:47] image of me
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; because you don't know who I am.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; You don't know my form."
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; And my form, furthermore, they didn't
[1:05:56] know. But his form changes. It changed.
[1:05:59] He changed his mask over and over.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; And so we find that when God spoke
[1:06:07] initially, he spoke to Adam and Eve. He
[1:06:11] spoke how he spoke. I do not know the
[1:06:14] language. That's I'm trying to get a
[1:06:16] point across to you that the language
[1:06:20] and the sounds of words actually are
[1:06:23] irrelevant.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:06:27] We're not worshiping just certain sounds
[1:06:30] of words. The sound of the words are
[1:06:33] irrelevant.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; It's what is conveyed to you
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; through the sound of those words.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; And if you only get words to your into
[1:06:45] your ears and then into your mind and
[1:06:49] you can get turnurning around and
[1:06:51] reasoning within and then it's on. Don't
[1:06:53] forget, listen to what the prophet says.
[1:06:55] when it gets into your mind, it's in the
[1:06:57] battleground.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; It's in the battleground and and but it
[1:07:02] has to get from there down into another
[1:07:04] channel which is the soul of faith. Uh
[1:07:07] uh faith a channel of faith down to the
[1:07:10] soul. And when believing takes place,
[1:07:14] when faith takes place, once again the
[1:07:16] prophet said faith is a revelation. And
[1:07:20] when that revelation strikes your soul,
[1:07:23] you have now become acquainted with a
[1:07:25] personal
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; and you cannot forget meeting that
[1:07:30] person.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; That's a person that knows you inside
[1:07:34] out.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; That's a person that knows you from your
[1:07:37] very beginning. And if you get to know
[1:07:40] that person, you will love that person.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; You will enter into a love relationship
[1:07:46] with that person. And you cannot forget
[1:07:49] that love relationship.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Now the voice
[1:08:21] Can we get lights down just a wee bit,
[1:08:23] please?
[1:08:31] So, in the beginning was the word.
[1:08:35] But what is the word?
[1:08:38] A word is a thought.
[1:08:40] A word is a thought manifested.
[1:08:44] A thought spoken forth
[1:08:47] and hold that manifested.
[1:08:50] God first he perceived. This is out of
[1:08:53] the message. God first he perceived the
[1:08:58] thought
[1:09:01] and spoke it.
[1:09:04] It became a word
[1:09:07] and the word became material.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Now that's the process. Right?
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; What is the word? As we hear, listen, we
[1:09:17] as message believers, we hear the word.
[1:09:19] You got to believe the word and you got
[1:09:21] to get the word and and listen to the
[1:09:24] word. And so what is the word?
[1:09:28] Is it just the English phraseology in
[1:09:32] the message books?
[1:09:34] It has to come to you because we perhaps
[1:09:37] put a lot of emphasis that I know I do
[1:09:40] and that's why I'm taking another step.
[1:09:42] take a lot of step. You've got you can
[1:09:44] hear it. You've got it on tape. You've
[1:09:46] got it on disc. You have it whatever
[1:09:49] more. But you can hear that to your
[1:09:51] dying day and not get the word.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; The word is more than just some phrases
[1:09:58] and how it's put together. And then they
[1:10:00] say, well, the word is it's a life. It
[1:10:02] is a life, but it's more than a life.
[1:10:05] It's a life that has come about by an
[1:10:07] acquaintance to a person.
[1:10:09] If you miss the person,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; if you miss that life, you've missed
[1:10:13] everything.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; And once you meet that life, I'll tell
[1:10:17] you what, you'll be a different person.
[1:10:19] That's all there is to it.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; In the fundamental foundation of faith,
[1:10:29] if you want to go back a little further,
[1:10:32] he said just as far as historical,
[1:10:36] you could see the word. You could see
[1:10:39] the word. In the beginning was the word.
[1:10:42] But what is the word? A word is a
[1:10:45] thought manifested. So now if you have
[1:10:48] if you have all kinds of doctrine or
[1:10:51] teaching or winds of this or that or or
[1:10:54] theology or people you know speaking the
[1:10:57] message and reading the quotes. It's
[1:10:59] more than that. It has to be manifested.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; There has to be a manifestation of that
[1:11:05] what was ever spoken
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; to prove what it was that was spoken.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says we'll come to it
[1:11:12] later. He said in the beginning he said
[1:11:14] let there be light.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; If it came a fog
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; it wasn't the word.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Can't say let there be light and then
[1:11:23] there comes a fog.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; You can't say God's holy and have an
[1:11:27] unholy people.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; It has to be manifested. A thought
[1:11:34] spoken forth. God first he perceived the
[1:11:38] thought and spoke it and it became a
[1:11:42] word and the word became material. So
[1:11:45] everything that God has spoke in his
[1:11:47] word received into the right channel
[1:11:51] will materialize that God for what uh
[1:11:54] materialize that that word for whatever
[1:11:58] the promise behind it is and God will do
[1:12:01] it he's obligated to it.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:06] manifested. What does manifested mean?
[1:12:09] Manifested is, and we're giving all of
[1:12:12] this so you can hopefully hold it in
[1:12:14] your heart while we just move along, is
[1:12:17] is to make clear,
[1:12:20] to see or understand.
[1:12:23] That's when something's manifested to
[1:12:25] you. So now the word has to be
[1:12:28] manifested
[1:12:30] and it that is to make it clear or to
[1:12:32] make something evident by showing or
[1:12:35] demonstrating it very clearly to appear
[1:12:39] or to be revealed.
[1:12:51] Now the scripture we read in the sound
[1:12:53] of a trumpet and the voice of words
[1:12:57] which voice they that heard intreated
[1:13:00] that the word that the word should not
[1:13:03] be spoken to them anymore. Now Apostle
[1:13:06] Paul is referring back to when uh dark
[1:13:11] and the cloud and God met Moses in the
[1:13:13] mountain. Now it's God. See, listen. So,
[1:13:18] now it's God in the mountain and he's
[1:13:21] speaking to Moses and giving him the
[1:13:24] giving him the uh tablets and Moses
[1:13:27] comes down. The people said, "Don't
[1:13:30] don't let God speak to us anymore
[1:13:33] directly like that." And and I'm very
[1:13:36] keen. I'm very very keen. I'm This
[1:13:38] isn't, you know, this isn't some uh I'm
[1:13:41] not just playing with words here. I'm
[1:13:44] interested in knowing what was that and
[1:13:47] h and how was it made known to them and
[1:13:50] what was it they turned down.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Now God [clears throat] spoke to Adam
[1:13:55] and Eve.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; How? I don't know. But they didn't keep
[1:13:59] it.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; God spoke through Moses
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; and the people didn't keep it.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; God spoke through the prophets. Now,
[1:14:11] different languages, different sounds,
[1:14:13] articulating different words, but the
[1:14:16] people didn't keep it.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; God was in Jesus Christ.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; It was God in Jesus Christ.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; You couldn't get God speaking. And he
[1:14:26] spoke the Galilean language. Different
[1:14:30] language, different sounds. And I don't
[1:14:32] know what kind of understanding was
[1:14:34] coming through the people, but they
[1:14:36] didn't keep it.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; NOW WE SAY, "PRAISE GOD. GOD HAS SET A
[1:14:40] PROPHET in this end time. I want to know
[1:14:43] what is the key
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; that we will move forward
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; and keep that word so that it DOES NOT
[1:14:52] DETERIORATE INTO CHURCHITY.
[1:14:56] [applause]
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT SO MANY CHURCHES. I'M NOT
[1:15:00] INTERESTED IN A CHURCH. I'M NOT
[1:15:02] INTERESTED IN THEOLOGY. I'M NOT
[1:15:05] INTERESTED IN SOME DEAD FORMALISM. I'M
[1:15:08] INTERESTED IN THE POWER OF GOD ALIVE IN
[1:15:11] A PEOPLE AND A PEOPLE WHO HAVE A A
[1:15:14] RELATIONSHIP AND ARE IN LOVE WITH JESUS
[1:15:18] CHRIST AND COME INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD
[1:15:22] AND THEY'RE QUICKENED. THEY'RE MOVED.
[1:15:24] THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE PUMPED. THEY DON'T
[1:15:26] HAVE TO BE ENTHUSED. THEY ARE ENTHUSED.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; THEY'VE BEEN WALKING WITH HIM. THEY'VE
[1:15:32] BEEN TALKING WITH HIM. BUT I SEE ALL
[1:15:35] DOWN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF MANKIND IS,
[1:15:38] YOU KNOW, GOD SPOKE, GOD SENT. GOD SENT
[1:15:41] THE PROPHET. THEY DIDN'T HEAR IT. GOD
[1:15:43] CAME. JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF DIDN'T HEAR
[1:15:45] HIM. DIDN'T HEAR. APOSTLE PAUL, DIDN'T
[1:15:48] HEAR WILLIAM BRANDHAM. LISTEN FRIENDS,
[1:15:50] OUR CHANCES ARE VERY SLIM. WE NEED TO
[1:15:53] REALLY, REALLY BUCKLE UP.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO REALLY TAKE THIS THING
[1:15:58] SERIOUS. WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO GLIDE
[1:16:00] ALONG and somehow slide into it. IT'LL
[1:16:04] BE A BATTLE EVERY INCH OF THE WAY.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; ALL HELL IS AGAINST THIS REVELATION.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Do I need to SAY IT AGAIN? ALL HELL
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; IS AGAINST THIS REVELATION
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE REVELATION IS ACTUALLY THE
[1:16:22] VOICE OF GOD
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; AND IT SPEAKS SPECIFICALLY TO YOU.
[1:16:35] You have to help me.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; I I've trembled at at bringing this
[1:16:41] word.
[1:16:45] Now the the word voice up here at the
[1:16:48] sound of the trumpet and the voice of
[1:16:50] words
[1:16:52] that is how they are articulated. the
[1:16:54] voice of words which voice the same
[1:16:57] thing and you know the word the Greek
[1:17:00] word is phone
[1:17:03] and the phone is a sound of uttered
[1:17:05] words it's speech or language but that
[1:17:09] word now this is this is this is the
[1:17:11] process of voice
[1:17:15] which came from pheno
[1:17:17] that is to appear or to be seen to bring
[1:17:21] forth into light or to become evident to
[1:17:26] come into view. So now the idea that God
[1:17:30] is conveying here, it's not just a sound
[1:17:33] on your ears, but it's to bring
[1:17:36] something or to appear because he's
[1:17:38] thinking of himself to be made visible
[1:17:44] and [clears throat] then that that comes
[1:17:45] also from foss which we know even in the
[1:17:49] English language is we say phosphorus
[1:17:53] because it is to shine or to make
[1:17:56] manifest.
[1:17:58] to make manifest by light or by fire. It
[1:18:01] speaks there distinctly of truth and
[1:18:04] it's knowledge light by knowledge and
[1:18:08] that because you see people when they
[1:18:10] hear something and they GET SOME
[1:18:12] KNOWLEDGE OH OH I SEE BECAUSE THERE'S
[1:18:16] SOME LIGHT FOSS has happened
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; it's not just some words but now the
[1:18:23] words had to be constructed into perhaps
[1:18:25] teaching or into preaching and then
[1:18:28] PEOPLE SAYS OH I GET IT.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S HAPPENED? THE LIGHT WENT ON.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; F happened.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; It's not just a phone.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST A FAINT. IT'S NOT JUST
[1:18:41] SOMETHING THAT THAT some some
[1:18:43] manifestation. But now they see what the
[1:18:45] MANIFESTATION'S ALL ABOUT.
[1:18:49] LOOK AT HOW V LOOK AT HOW visibly how
[1:18:52] how evidently THAT GOD HIMSELF HERE'S a
[1:18:56] human here's a human STANDING HERE AS A
[1:18:59] PROPHET SPEAKING to another human and
[1:19:02] and THE PEOPLE ARE MISSING IT COMPLETELY
[1:19:04] AND HE'S TELLING HIM I JUST READ IT HE
[1:19:06] SAID I the this is the doctor he says I
[1:19:10] SEE THE DOCTOR STANDING BY YOUR BEDSIDE
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; AND SHE'S ALREADY OUT OF THE HOSPITAL
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN IN A HOSPITAL. YOU HAD AN
[1:19:17] OPERATION. I SEE THE I SEE THE DOCTOR BY
[1:19:21] YOUR BEDSIDE TELLING YOU ABOUT YOUR
[1:19:23] SITUATION. AND HERE'S A MAN IN ANOTHER
[1:19:26] WORLD TELLING HER, "BUT THE PEOPLE DON'T
[1:19:29] GET IT."
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; WHAT I'M SAYING IS THEY SAW THE
[1:19:34] MANIFESTATION BUT DIDN'T HEAR THE VOICE.
[1:19:40] LISTEN, BELIEVERS, WE GOT TO GO A LOT
[1:19:42] FURTHER THAN JUST SEE A good life and
[1:19:44] wear a long dress and and look like a
[1:19:47] believer. IT GOES WAY BEYOND THAT.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; THE LIGHT HAS TO GO ON INSIDE. YOU NEED
[1:19:57] TO HEAR YOUR NAME.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE CALLED.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO ENTER INTO A RELATIONSHIP.
[1:20:04] YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THIS IS A MAN
[1:20:06] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And that false here's the here's the
[1:20:16] process.
[1:20:18] And last is Femi to say or make known
[1:20:22] one's thoughts. So we've gone full
[1:20:25] circle.
[1:20:26] So God in the beginning spoke his
[1:20:29] thoughts and the purpose is that so
[1:20:32] it'll COME OUT ALL THROUGH THE CENTURIES
[1:20:34] OF man's learning and wisdom and it'll
[1:20:37] BE FORMED INTO WORDS and shaped into
[1:20:40] sentences and phrases and MEN WILL SPEAK
[1:20:43] GOD'S word and men as they were moved BY
[1:20:46] THE HOLY GHOST. BUT THE PURPOSE IS THAT
[1:20:49] truth would come.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And the light would go on.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE THE LIGHT WOULD GO ON, IT
[1:20:55] WOULD ALSO BE A FIRE.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; JEREMIAH SAID, "I GOING TO I CAN'T SPEAK
[1:21:02] THIS." HE COULDN'T SPEAK IT. BUT IT WAS
[1:21:04] A FIRE.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; WENT ON. WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS PHASEROUS.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; IT WAS AN EXPLOSION TAKING PLACE. BUT
[1:21:13] THE PURPOSE OF IT WAS THOSE WORDS AND
[1:21:16] THE LIGHT AND THE FIRE WAS SO THAT THE
[1:21:19] THOUGHT OF GOD COULD BE MADE KNOWN TO
[1:21:21] THE person
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; and that person would enter into a
[1:21:26] relationship
[1:21:27] knowing who had spoken with them.
[1:21:34] So now we have
[1:21:42] see you refuse not him that speaketh
[1:21:50] whose voice then shook the earth.
[1:21:53] This God's word
[1:21:55] you don't have to be a very intelligent
[1:21:57] person. Say yet once more.
[1:22:00] yet promised saying, "Yet once more. I
[1:22:03] shake not the earth only, but the
[1:22:05] heaven." If there's ever been a time or
[1:22:09] an age in man's history that he became
[1:22:11] conscious of the heavens, we're in a
[1:22:14] space age.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; We send up everything into space, right?
[1:22:18] On airplanes with tons of baggage and
[1:22:21] people and freight and all these bodies.
[1:22:24] And last time I got on coming over here
[1:22:27] back from Europe, I thought my wife
[1:22:29] says, "How's this thing going to get off
[1:22:30] the ground?" See, bringing all those
[1:22:33] carts and and
[1:22:35] uh forklifts and everything else coming
[1:22:37] up into the plane, loading the thing up,
[1:22:39] say, "Oh, oh, we don't think anything of
[1:22:41] it. Everybody we fly all over the
[1:22:43] world." Well, they didn't a few years
[1:22:45] ago.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; This is the space age.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; THIS GOD WHO SPOKE this word knew we're
[1:22:51] going to come to this hour. and he knew
[1:22:53] were going TO BE, OH, YOU'RE ON YOUR
[1:22:55] CELL PHONE AND YOU'RE YAPPING AND
[1:22:57] carrying on. You don't have a clue. But
[1:22:59] those specific words with the very
[1:23:01] articulation of your voice and the very
[1:23:04] characteristic of your VOICE IS BEING
[1:23:07] CARRIED BUT in in just micros
[1:23:10] secondsonds around the world and people
[1:23:12] are hearing and you're talking and
[1:23:13] laughing and everything else cuz your
[1:23:15] voice is going there.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; This is the age. Amen.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; But the prophet is saying that THERE'S
[1:23:22] GOING TO BE ANOTHER AGE.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; There's going to be A TIME BECAUSE GOD
[1:23:26] HAS SAID ONCE MORE I'M GOING TO SHAKE
[1:23:29] NOT THE EARTH BUT THE HEAVENS ALSO.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; AND I SAY THERE'S a voice.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A TRUE VOICE
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; THAT IS CIRCLING THIS GLOBE.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IT IS THE ONE VOICE IN
[1:23:41] THIS END TIME THAT COME AS THUS SAYETH
[1:23:44] THE LORD. WE HAVE A THUS SAYITH THE LORD
[1:23:47] GOING AROUND THIS ENTIRE GLOBE AT THIS
[1:23:50] VERY MOMENT. THE WORDS OF MALACHI 4 ARE
[1:23:54] GOING AROUND. IN FACT IS IT'S THE ONLY
[1:23:57] WORDS THAT I KNOW OF THAT GOD HAS
[1:23:59] VINDICATED.
[1:24:02] A VINDICATED VOICE IS SHAKING IN THE
[1:24:05] HEAVENS.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; CALLING CALLING FOR AN END TO ALL
[1:24:10] THINGS. A VINDICATED VOICE CALLING FOR A
[1:24:13] NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH AND A
[1:24:17] DESTRUCTION OF ALL OF THE EVIL THAT'S UP
[1:24:20] THERE. ALL THE PERVERSION, ALL THE FALSE
[1:24:23] TEACHING, HE SAID IT'LL BE BURNED UP
[1:24:26] WITH A HOLY FIRE.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THOSE WORDS MEAN TO YOU,
[1:24:34] WHATEVER A HOLY FIRE MEANS TO YOU, IT
[1:24:37] DOESN'T I IT'S IRRELEVANT TO ME AS LONG
[1:24:40] AS THE HOLY SPIRIT CONVEYS TO YOU THAT
[1:24:43] UP IN THE SKY, IN THE HEAVENS, AROUND
[1:24:45] THIS GLOBE AND IN THE UNIVERSE IS THE
[1:24:48] VOICE OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:24:52] [applause]
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; I want to say this a simply. You want to
[1:24:58] take what I'm saying today very serious.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; I've never preached on this in my life.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; There was a time when there was no sound
[1:25:21] of words
[1:25:25] such as we know it today.
[1:25:31] And all that we speak about revelation,
[1:25:33] brother Brandham said, and I've heard,
[1:25:36] but now I see.
[1:25:38] He said, "What is a revealed?
[1:25:42] Is a secret made known?"
[1:25:45] A revelation is to reveal or make known
[1:25:49] a secret. All kinds of people got
[1:25:52] secrets. all the churches and everybody
[1:25:54] they got like some secret has been I've
[1:25:57] heard people on the radio years ago that
[1:26:00] opened the seven seals. It's amazing. I
[1:26:03] listened. I don't remember a single
[1:26:05] thing.
[1:26:10] That Mr. Armstrong said
[1:26:13] going to open the seals.
[1:26:18] A revelation is the revealing of
[1:26:20] something previously hidden or secret.
[1:26:24] So now I want to talk about a true
[1:26:26] revelation. Is everyone listening?
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; In the God of this evil age,
[1:26:34] he said he keeps you from seeing the
[1:26:38] true revelation. I'm not only I'm this
[1:26:41] is not to be negative and it's not to be
[1:26:44] positive this morning. This is to just
[1:26:45] cut it down the line. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; And to show us as believers what our
[1:26:50] problems are.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Show us as believers what our enemy
[1:26:54] seeks to do.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; And is trying to hinder us from getting
[1:26:59] a true revelation
[1:27:01] because a true revelation is a
[1:27:03] relationship.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; He keeps you from seeing the true
[1:27:08] revelation and faith in God's word being
[1:27:12] revealed and vindicated by his schools.
[1:27:17] libraries.
[1:27:19] Now, I'm not talking about just a normal
[1:27:21] library. I'm talking brother Brandham's
[1:27:23] talking on a spiritual level. They had
[1:27:25] all kind the the schools that resisted
[1:27:27] him was not the public school system.
[1:27:29] The schools that resisted him was Bible
[1:27:31] schools,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; theological schools, seminaries. They're
[1:27:37] the ones that devised doctrines that
[1:27:39] resisted him and literature and
[1:27:43] hospitals and so forth. because there
[1:27:46] hospitals all kinds of uh religious
[1:27:48] institution mostly uh of the Catholic
[1:27:51] faith and I won't even get into it but
[1:27:53] they raised up hospitals that you know
[1:27:55] that this was some kind of a a spiritual
[1:27:57] uh spiritual thing he went to work there
[1:27:59] and so on and he said and so forth and
[1:28:02] that keeps you from it. [clears throat]
[1:28:03] He is now He is now interpreting as he
[1:28:07] did to Pharaoh. That Satan is now
[1:28:09] interpreting the word as he did to
[1:28:12] Pharaoh. Trying to keep you from seeing
[1:28:14] the meaning of the vindicated word. The
[1:28:18] meaning of the vindicated word
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; that [clears throat] he promised for
[1:28:27] this age in the evening lights,
[1:28:30] vindicated and proved. He's trying by
[1:28:34] his knowledge and schools and better
[1:28:36] educated people and ethics and so forth
[1:28:39] to keep you away from seeing that
[1:28:42] anything so that you won't look at that
[1:28:46] and see that's Jesus Christ.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; He is using anything
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; that is possible. anything.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; He said anything so that you won't look
[1:28:58] at that
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; and see. Some people look at it but they
[1:29:04] don't see. And a lot of people in the
[1:29:06] message I'm speaking to message
[1:29:09] believers and many will probably hear
[1:29:11] this even thousands. There's a lot of
[1:29:13] people in message that are looking at it
[1:29:16] but have not seen JESUS CHRIST.
[1:29:24] They've seen new truth or THEY'VE SEEN
[1:29:26] SOME, WOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE.
[1:29:28] THAT'S NOT WHY he sent the message.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Hear all about the serpent seed and it
[1:29:36] wasn't an apple and SAY, "DO YOU KNOW
[1:29:38] WHAT? I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WAS
[1:29:40] SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT THAT." Of course
[1:29:41] it's not apples. Of course it had to be
[1:29:44] sex. Of course it had to be twins.
[1:29:46] That's not a revelation.
[1:29:48] That's just putting it together in your
[1:29:50] mind. Say, "I've never heard that
[1:29:52] before." OF COURSE, YOU NEVER HEARD IT
[1:29:54] BEFORE.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't make it a revelation.
[1:29:58] But a revelation is WHEN YOU SEE THE
[1:30:00] CHRIST OF CALVARY,
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; THE LAMB OF GOD,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; SHEDDING THE BLOOD FOR YOUR SIN, AND YOU
[1:30:08] FALL IN LOVE WITH THAT PERSON.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN NEVER FORGET THE PERSON WHO DIED
[1:30:16] FOR YOU. AMEN.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "How do you know it's Jesus
[1:30:25] Christ?" He said, "He is the word and
[1:30:28] he's the word of this age."
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; So even the word of this age, I know I
[1:30:34] may I'm saying this at the risk of being
[1:30:36] misunderstood.
[1:30:38] Even even they have you can have
[1:30:40] 1100,200 tapes
[1:30:43] and the WORD IS IN KENTUCKY AND ENGLISH
[1:30:47] and so some GLORY IN THE FACT WELL IT'S
[1:30:49] JUST PLAIN AND AS USED AS hints and as
[1:30:52] all of those THINGS THAT HAS NOTHING TO
[1:30:54] DO WITH IT.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; JESUS SPOKE THE GUTAL LANGUAGE OF THE
[1:30:59] GALILEAN PEOPLE BUT THAT ISN'T WHAT MADE
[1:31:01] HIM HOLY OR MADE IT HOLY AND IT WASN'T
[1:31:05] HIS LANGUAGE THAT MADE HIM CHRIST.
[1:31:08] THAT WAS PART OF HIS VEIL.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; THE LITTLE MAN FROM KENTUCKY THAT GOD
[1:31:17] USED HIM AND AND WAS IN HIM. THAT WASN'T
[1:31:20] THAT WASN'T THAT WAS JUST PART OF THE
[1:31:22] VEIL. THE POOR LANGUAGE IS PART OF THE
[1:31:25] VEIL. AND SO ALL THESE WORDS, YOU COULD
[1:31:28] HAVE ALL THE WORDS ON, 1200 TAPES AND
[1:31:30] ALL THE BOOKS AND EVERY KIND. YOU STILL
[1:31:32] HAVEN'T GOT CHRIST.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO GET A REVELATION. AMEN.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN I SAY YOU'VE GOT TO GET A
[1:31:38] REVELATION, I SAY THAT'S WHAT GOD GAVE
[1:31:41] IT FOR IS SO THAT THE PEOPLE CAN COME
[1:31:44] INTO A RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT PERSON.
[1:31:48] YOU MIGHT LOOK AT IT, BUT HE SAYS THEY
[1:31:50] LOOK AT IT BUT DON'T SEE JESUS CHRIST.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; I'M SPEAKING WITH CONVICTION, FRIENDS.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; I'M SPEAKING WITH DEADLY CONVICTION. IF
[1:32:00] THIS WOULD BE MY LAST MESSAGE, THIS IS
[1:32:02] WHAT I'D WANT TO SAY.
[1:32:05] WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LOOK AT IT AND
[1:32:07] FAIL TO SEE HIM.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; IF YOU JUST LOOK AT IT IN BOOKS, IT CAN
[1:32:14] STAY THERE FOREVER
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; AND DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU. AND
[1:32:18] THEN YOU GET STIRRED BY SOMEBODY REBUKE
[1:32:21] OVER THE POPE AND SAY, "OH, YEAH. I
[1:32:23] GUESS I I NEED TO READ IT. I'll go HOME
[1:32:25] AND AND SAY WHAT I READ." YOU YOU'VE
[1:32:28] MISSED IT.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
[1:32:32] THE WHOLE MESSAGE CAME TO REVEAL A
[1:32:34] PERSON
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; AND THAT PERSON IS OUR creator
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; so I want to show them from the
[1:32:49] scriptures that the true and accurate
[1:32:52] hearing
[1:32:54] a true and accurate HEARING OF THE VOICE
[1:32:58] or the words of GOD IS IN ACT OF
[1:33:01] REVELATION. THE REVELATION IS the
[1:33:04] hearing.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; AND THE HEARING AND THE REVELATION AND
[1:33:09] THE PERSON WHO'S being revealed, they're
[1:33:11] one and the same.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS, "AND THE LORD
[1:33:22] APPEARED TO ABRAM."
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; How did he appear?
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; What struck his eyes?
[1:33:30] You don't know. I don't know. But we
[1:33:32] know one thing. HE BUILT AN ALTAR AND
[1:33:34] WORSHIPED.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Worship is always
[1:33:41] very very close to the revelation.
[1:33:47] [clears throat]
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; There's a recent study
[1:33:51] that just is happening at this time
[1:33:55] and uh I guess the medical people have
[1:33:57] been working on it for a long time.
[1:34:01] And what they did was they took several
[1:34:03] persons that were born blind.
[1:34:08] And uh they showed that
[1:34:11] the part of their brain that a part of
[1:34:14] their brain used for vision called the
[1:34:17] visual cortex
[1:34:19] that part of their brain was activated
[1:34:22] by sound not and supposed to be
[1:34:25] activated only by sight but it was
[1:34:28] actually activated by sound
[1:34:31] and the tapping that's why they say the
[1:34:33] tapping of a person's cane you know and
[1:34:36] they actually showed
[1:34:38] and and this man and I I saw this on the
[1:34:42] a screen and this man he's tapping his
[1:34:45] cane and they have him out in a a a big
[1:34:48] area with walls and posts and so on and
[1:34:53] he's tapping his crane cane just blind
[1:34:55] as can be and he just comes up within a
[1:34:57] foot or two of that and he just turns
[1:34:59] with that and then there's another one
[1:35:01] right there and he goes right around it
[1:35:02] and he's just tapping his cane and they
[1:35:05] have taken these people they've taken
[1:35:07] about 12 of them now born blind. They
[1:35:10] had to be born blind and they put them
[1:35:13] and they've given them in put them in a
[1:35:15] MRI machine and registered when sounds
[1:35:19] were registering the sound their visual
[1:35:23] cortex the visual cortex their brain
[1:35:27] went into action and they said they're
[1:35:29] actually seeing by hearing
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; and then they took people who never were
[1:35:35] blind just had their eyesight and put
[1:35:38] them into the same container container
[1:35:40] put them in the same MRI machine and
[1:35:43] their c the visual cortex did not
[1:35:46] activate at sound.
[1:35:49] So they said the upshot of this was and
[1:35:52] the reason I'm bringing it is a very I
[1:35:54] have a very very definite reason for
[1:35:56] bringing it is that they began to see
[1:36:01] they actually could see
[1:36:04] not with their eyes but they could see
[1:36:06] there's an object there
[1:36:09] because their brain was telling them
[1:36:10] there's an object there and they would
[1:36:12] just turn from it like that
[1:36:16] and it was by they they concluded that
[1:36:19] it was because of the they exercised
[1:36:22] that part because they didn't have the
[1:36:24] faculty of sight
[1:36:27] that through exercising by all of their
[1:36:30] life their their hearing became so
[1:36:34] heightened through exercising that it
[1:36:38] actually give them vision.
[1:36:40] I say this
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; one thing you're here hearing in the
[1:36:44] word of God today. I trust that the same
[1:36:48] thing takes place where you hear the
[1:36:50] word so distinctly.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; You hear it preached so clearly.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; You hear it anointed by the Holy Ghost
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; until it begins to give you sight
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; AND YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE PERSON
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:37:08] PEOPLE ARE LOOKING, HE SAID, BUT THEY'RE
[1:37:09] NOT SEEING HIM.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY WE WANT TO LOOK AT HIM
[1:37:14] THROUGH HEARING THE WORD THAT GOD SAID
[1:37:17] AND AND EXERCISE THAT inner voice.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; HEAR IT, NOT HEAR. HEAR IT HERE. I WANT
[1:37:25] YOU ALL TO SAY, "WHAT'S HE SAYING?
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS BROTHER ED SAYING TODAY? WHAT IS
[1:37:31] THIS WORD THAT'S COMING TO US?"
[1:37:34] AND MAYBE YOU'RE SITTING HERE and say,
[1:37:35] "I HAVE NEVER REALLY MET CHRIST IN SUCH
[1:37:38] A WAY, IN SUCH A REALITY." I WANT TO SAY
[1:37:42] HE'S HERE AND AVAILABLE TO YOU.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; HE SENT THIS MESSAGE TO GIVE YOU ACCESS
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; into his presence.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; We need to exercise that faculty.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; YOU DO HAVE THE FACULTY. GOD HAS CALLED
[1:38:01] YOU. YOU have an inner uh an inner man
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; that can hear THAT CAN PICK UP THE
[1:38:09] SOUND. AND YOU KNOW, I find that in the
[1:38:12] church realm
[1:38:15] and at the time of of
[1:38:19] at those moments in life
[1:38:22] when things are very heightened,
[1:38:24] emotionally heightened,
[1:38:28] the time of maybe when there's a moving
[1:38:31] of the spirit of God in a service
[1:38:36] at the time when a couple fall in love
[1:38:41] and they move towards
[1:38:43] marriage,
[1:38:45] engagement in marriage and at a time
[1:38:48] when death comes.
[1:38:51] Those instances, those three,
[1:38:56] you find that the realm of the spirit,
[1:38:58] which is the entire emotional being that
[1:39:01] you have,
[1:39:03] and the and the soul, your soul, those
[1:39:07] two almost become compressed together.
[1:39:11] And it's it's almost impossible to find
[1:39:14] the separating point. And that's why I
[1:39:17] always question couples that come to me
[1:39:19] that say, "I I I I feel we're attracted
[1:39:22] to one another. What has attracted you
[1:39:24] to one another?" I try to get that
[1:39:27] question answered. Why are you attracted
[1:39:30] to one another? Because I want to try to
[1:39:32] find out if there's something and
[1:39:34] sometimes they've learned the right
[1:39:37] phrases from the message. Oh, I've
[1:39:40] noticed his character. Really?
[1:39:45] you know, I see the kind of woman that
[1:39:48] she is and and she'll be a good mother
[1:39:51] to my children. Really? Is that what
[1:39:53] attracted you to her or is there
[1:39:55] something else? Uh and then we come in
[1:39:59] uh in the meetings. That's why that's
[1:40:01] why brother Brandham when he was
[1:40:03] speaking, remember now friends, you
[1:40:05] perhaps have never seen what I've seen.
[1:40:08] I've been in meetings that would send
[1:40:11] goosebumps all over your body and raise
[1:40:14] the hair on your neck. Seeing the Holy
[1:40:17] Spirit sweep into a congregation of
[1:40:20] people and take over the meeting to the
[1:40:23] the minister couldn't minister anymore.
[1:40:26] I'VE STOOD BEHIND THE PULPIT MYSELF AND
[1:40:28] COLLAPSED OVER THE PULPIT IN SOBS AND
[1:40:31] WEEPING AT AT THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY
[1:40:33] SPIRIT, AT THE PRESENCE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:40:36] AND THE PEOPLE JUST MOVE INTO WORSHIP
[1:40:38] AND MOVE INTO WHATEVER ELSE AND THEN
[1:40:41] PERSON COULD YOU COULDN'T GO OUT OF THAT
[1:40:42] MEETING AND SAY WELL GOD WASN'T THERE
[1:40:45] THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MEETING AND YET
[1:40:47] THERE WAS NO GUARANTEE THEY'D TAKE THE
[1:40:49] WORD OF GOD
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; and then you have a thus SAYITH THE LORD
[1:40:52] BUT NOW WE'RE IN ANOTHER AGE WE'VE HAD
[1:40:55] THUS SAYETH THE Lord and we and AND
[1:40:57] THERE'S A GREAT DANGER AND I SEE IT AS I
[1:41:00] TRAVEL PEOPLE ARE LAXING BACK INTO A
[1:41:03] CHURCH REALM
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE LAXING BACK INTO A RELIGION.
[1:41:06] [applause]
[1:41:07] THIS IS NOT A RELIGION.
[1:41:11] THIS IS TRUE RELIGION, PURE RELIGION.
[1:41:14] THIS IS JESUS CHRIST.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A DANGER OF PEOPLE WALKING
[1:41:18] ON PAST HIM, TAKING A LOOK AND NOT BEING
[1:41:21] MOVED, NOT ENTERING INTO a relationship
[1:41:23] with him.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; So, you heard the word. Oh, yeah. We
[1:41:27] heard the word. We're down SOME SPECIAL
[1:41:28] MEETINGS. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
[1:41:30] IT.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; You could be sitting in YOUR ROOM. YOU
[1:41:34] COULD BE SITTING IN YOUR CHAIR AT THE
[1:41:35] KITCHEN AND ENTER INTO A GREATER
[1:41:37] RELATIONSHIP than you did in the
[1:41:38] convention.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; You can be OUT IN THE WOODS
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; AND ENTER INTO A RELATIONSHIP THAT THE
[1:41:49] PEOPLE IN CHURCH DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
[1:41:50] ABOUT.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SIT UNDER THE BEST PREACHERS IN
[1:41:54] THE COUNTRY. THEY THEY SAT UNDER WILLIAM
[1:41:56] BRANDON BY THE THOUSANDS, BY THE
[1:41:59] MILLIONS, AND ONLY A HANDFUL. THAT'S WHY
[1:42:01] HE SAID FEW FEW THERE BE.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; My brother, MY SISTER, THIS MAY COST YOU
[1:42:10] EVERYTHING.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; THIS CHRIST MAY COST YOU EVERYTHING,
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S WORTH EVERYTHING AND MORE.
[1:42:21] AMEN.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; So our first parents, as I said earlier,
[1:42:28] Adam and Eve, they heard the voice and
[1:42:32] words.
[1:42:33] For the scripture says they heard the
[1:42:35] voice of God walking.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Put that one together. In the garden.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; I don't know what kind of a sound was
[1:42:42] walking. I don't know what IT WAS, BUT
[1:42:45] GOD WAS there
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; walking in the garden. and they were not
[1:42:50] able to keep the word.
[1:42:53] The people heard the prophets.
[1:42:58] They heard Jesus Christ.
[1:43:01] They heard the apostles.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; They heard the messengers.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; And they've HEARD A HOST OF WITNESSES.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; And yet most failed to hear the words of
[1:43:13] God.
[1:43:19] Now
[1:43:22] stay very attent.
[1:43:26] The Bible says Abel offered
[1:43:30] an acceptable sacrifice
[1:43:33] and the prophet of God gave us the key.
[1:43:37] So now we have the key in Genesis
[1:43:40] because Genesis is the seed chapter and
[1:43:43] the key we have Adam and Eve who were
[1:43:46] not able to keep they were not able to
[1:43:49] keep the words OF GOD WITH GOD HIMSELF
[1:43:53] SPEAKING IT.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; How do you like THAT ONE? RIGHT?
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF IN WHATEVER WAY HE CHOSE,
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; HE CONVEYED TO THEM his word AND THEY
[1:44:07] WERE NOT ABLE TO KEEP IT. But
[1:44:12] Adam's son,
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Abel,
[1:44:18] and the BIBLE SAYS BY FAITH.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; And our prophet said faith is a
[1:44:24] revelation. That's right.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; So by a revelation
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; somehow he was attuned
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; to an inner voice.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT FRUIT,
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT APPLE.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; IT JUST DOESN'T AGREE WITH WHAT'S INSIDE
[1:44:40] OF ME.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOME OTHER THING.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE FRUIT OF THE FIELD. AND
[1:44:47] HE'S OUT AND SOMETHING'S MOVING HIM. BUT
[1:44:49] HE'S BECOMING ATTUNED TO A VOICE INSIDE.
[1:44:53] AND PERHAPS HE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. HE
[1:44:56] DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE SAYING,
[1:45:01] "IT'S BLOOD. IT'S BLOOD. IT'S BLOOD.
[1:45:04] I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS ANIMAL.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; I GOT TO TAKE THIS PURE ANIMAL.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; I GOT TO TAKE THIS SPOTLESS ONE.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; I GOT TO SLAY IT." THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; AND HE becomes he I'm NOT GOING TO
[1:45:18] DRAMATIZE IT, BUT HE BECOMES BESIDE
[1:45:20] HIMSELF
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S HACKING AT THE THROAT OF THIS
[1:45:24] LAMB.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; HEY, HE HE'S HE'S ACTUALLY ACTING OUT
[1:45:28] WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH JESUS
[1:45:30] CHRIST.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; GOING TO BE BRUTALIZED ON THE CROSS.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME, FRIENDS?
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't think I'm off my
[1:45:40] rocker.
[1:45:44] HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET, OUR PROPHET SAID HE BY
[1:45:48] REVELATION
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE KEY.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; BY REVELATION DOESN'T SAY HE HEARD A
[1:45:56] VOICE. SOMEBODY CAME AND PREACHED TO
[1:45:57] HIM. SOMEBODY GAVE HIM A MESSAGE. I'M
[1:46:00] SAYING ALL OF THAT. THERE'S nothing
[1:46:01] wrong with preaching. NOTHING WRONG WITH
[1:46:03] WE'RE GOING TO BE PREACHING HERE.
[1:46:04] NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR WITNESSING. IT
[1:46:06] HAS TO GO BEYOND THAT. AND WE NEED TO
[1:46:09] EXERCISE OURSELVES TO OUR inner hearing.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; And the reason why I even hesitated on
[1:46:18] this subject because I've had people
[1:46:20] come up with the wonkiest revelations.
[1:46:23] The wonkiest revelation. Well, God told
[1:46:25] me really,
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE that it ALSO
[1:46:31] LINES UP WITH THE word of God.
[1:46:38] A true revelation will be in HARMONY
[1:46:42] WITH THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:46:49] Brother Brandham had a man minister and
[1:46:52] another woman who was telling him all
[1:46:54] about their their oh great things and
[1:46:57] all the rest of it and and he said well
[1:47:00] God told him to he had a dream and
[1:47:03] brother Brandham said well it's very
[1:47:05] sweet but it's not recording the word of
[1:47:07] God
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; you can have all kinds of you know
[1:47:11] revelations and things and
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; I had people come and sometime you know
[1:47:21] try to give advice or counsel about how
[1:47:24] the church or this or that about the
[1:47:26] people or about this brother that
[1:47:27] brother I tell you what the first thing
[1:47:29] that I want to do is see their life in
[1:47:32] accordance with the word of God and if
[1:47:34] their life doesn't line up with the word
[1:47:36] of God I haven't got the time of the day
[1:47:38] for it
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; I don't want to sound harsh but that's
[1:47:41] the truth friends We don't know how much
[1:47:43] more time we want. And I'm not
[1:47:45] interested in wasting it on what
[1:47:47] somebody thinks or some serpent seed
[1:47:49] thinks cuz there going to be lots of it
[1:47:51] around.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. There's more
[1:47:54] serpent seed out there than there is
[1:47:55] God's seed.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; And don't THINK FOR A SECOND THAT
[1:48:01] THEY'RE AFRAID of these walls.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; NOT A BIT. THEY'RE NOT AFRAID OF YOU OR
[1:48:07] your home or anything else. SATAN IS SO
[1:48:09] BRAZEN. HE'LL COME RIGHT IN. AND NOTICE
[1:48:12] WHAT HE CAME IN WHEN HE BEGAN TO SPEAK
[1:48:14] TO JESUS CHRIST. WHAT HE FINALLY CAME
[1:48:16] TO. IF YOU'LL FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP ME.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SPEAKS, HE WANTS WORSHIP.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; AND THEN, BROTHER BRANDHAM COMES IN THE
[1:48:30] TIMES I DESCRIBED A MOMENT AGO WHEN THE
[1:48:32] HOLY SPIRIT WAS FALLING IN 1948, REVIVAL
[1:48:36] THROUGH TO 1958. AND WOO, people had all
[1:48:40] kinds of chills down their back and ALL
[1:48:42] KINDS OF THINGS HAPPENING. BUT WHEN THE
[1:48:44] WORD CAME, THUS SAYETH the Lord, they
[1:48:46] don't have anything to do with it.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS THE ACID TEST. AND A LOT OF
[1:48:51] PEOPLE THAT I SAT IN FELLOWSHIP WITH. A
[1:48:54] LOT OF PEOPLE I'VE SEEN THEM WEEP. I'VE
[1:48:56] SEEN THEM AT THE ALTAR. I'VE SEEN THEM
[1:48:58] DOING ANYTHING YOU AND I DO AND SING
[1:49:01] LIKE ANGELS. BUT WHEN THE WORD CAME,
[1:49:03] TURN IT DOWN.
[1:49:05] And I tell you, my brother, my sister,
[1:49:07] ANYBODY THAT'S HEARING TO MY VOICE or
[1:49:09] hearing me today, and I don't care what
[1:49:11] office they whether they're a minister
[1:49:13] or or whether they're a deacon or
[1:49:14] whether they're a trustee or what they
[1:49:17] are
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; when they come to THAT MESSAGE BECAUSE
[1:49:20] THAT'S THE ONLY VINDICATED VOICE THAT
[1:49:22] WE'VE GOT IN THE HEAVENS.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ONLY VINDICATED VOICE WE'VE HAD
[1:49:25] ON EARTH.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THEY READ THAT AND SAY, "WELL,
[1:49:28] BUT THAT doesn't mean anything. That
[1:49:29] doesn't apply." I'm sorry. That's where
[1:49:31] our relationship ends. Amen.
[1:49:37] [applause]
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, the prophet didn't do that.
[1:49:44] THAT'S NOT THE PROPHET STYLE. That's not
[1:49:46] his pattern." Well, well, we've gone on.
[1:49:49] WELL, THEN YOU CAN JUST KEEP GOING ON.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; So, Abel offered a revelation. The Bible
[1:50:04] says, "By faith, Abel offered unto God a
[1:50:06] more excellent sacrifice."
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Can I go on just a little bit, please?
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Then Cain, by which he obtained a
[1:50:20] witness that he was righteous, God
[1:50:23] testifying of his gifts, and by by it he
[1:50:28] being dead yet speaketh.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? And the prophet
[1:50:33] said in the message I will restore. Abel
[1:50:36] had a vision from the Lord. It was
[1:50:39] spiritually it was spiritual revealed
[1:50:42] truth
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; that it wasn't apples that brought them
[1:50:45] out of the Garden of Eden. He believed
[1:50:48] God
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; because God had revealed it to him.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; That's why he believed God because it
[1:50:54] was revealed to him.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:59] He says, "How do you think that Abel
[1:51:01] knew to bring a lamb instead of an apple
[1:51:04] or whatever you want to call it? How did
[1:51:07] he know to bring a lamb? Because no
[1:51:10] Bible was written in them days.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; How did he know?" Listen friends, he's
[1:51:17] not asking a question just to be trick
[1:51:20] people. How did he know to bring a lamb
[1:51:23] when there was no Bible written? So the
[1:51:25] prophet's saying what I'm trying to say
[1:51:27] today, there were no words.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; He didn't read it in a book.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, under the authority of
[1:51:38] God's word, YOU POSSESS SOMETHING. WE
[1:51:42] GET SO IN TUNE with this world. And and
[1:51:44] I see ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY AND
[1:51:46] THEY GOT HEADPHONES IN THERE AND they're
[1:51:48] just going down THE STREET AND JUST
[1:51:50] chugging along, you know, AND EVERYBODY
[1:51:52] THE WHOLE PLACE IS OBSESSED WITH IT and
[1:51:55] and all the music and all the videos and
[1:51:58] all that. What it is that is to the
[1:52:01] senses
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; of the body, the hearing. AND WE'RE SO
[1:52:05] CONSUMED WITH THOSE SENSES, YOUNG
[1:52:07] PEOPLE, YOU WILL NEVER ACQUIRE AN INNER
[1:52:10] VOICE. YOU'LL NEVER ACQUIRE AN INNER
[1:52:13] HEARING IF YOU STAY CONSUMED WITH WHAT
[1:52:16] TOUCHES THIS BODY.
[1:52:22] AND THEN FROM THE BODY IT GETS TO THE
[1:52:25] EMOTIONAL REALM AND YOU START FEELING
[1:52:28] CONNECTED TO PEOPLE AND YOU START
[1:52:30] FEELING A CERTAIN EMOTION AND IT'LL TURN
[1:52:33] A LOT OF IT WILL TURN PERVERTED SEXUAL
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE AVENUE THAT SATAN IS
[1:52:41] USING.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; And then I SAID A MOMENT AGO, EXCUSE ME
[1:52:45] FOR GOING BACK. I SAID BUT THEN AT A
[1:52:47] time when when there's the the soul and
[1:52:52] the spirit become so almost homogenized
[1:52:56] together at a time of of marriage or or
[1:53:03] you know engagement or love
[1:53:07] at a time of in the meetings
[1:53:10] at a time when there's an intense move
[1:53:12] of God or at a time when there are other
[1:53:16] times too it or a time of death
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; and they become so tight
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; homogenized together
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; don't don't leave us out on a limb
[1:53:26] brother Ed I won't
[1:53:30] I'll take you right back to the message
[1:53:31] and ask you also another question you
[1:53:33] have to ask yourself why
[1:53:36] why when people were standing in front
[1:53:39] of the prophet and and and they were at
[1:53:42] a crisis I see a dark shadow over you uh
[1:53:45] Uh, I see your your husband is in the
[1:53:49] hospital. I see him in the hospital as I
[1:53:52] read it yesterday. He's in the hospital
[1:53:54] and he's dying with tuberculosis. DON'T
[1:53:57] TELL ME THAT SHE WASN'T in in the in the
[1:54:00] throws of agony.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Your husband's DYING IN THE HOSPITAL
[1:54:05] WITH TUBERCULOSIS AND SHE'S STANDING
[1:54:08] THERE BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN
[1:54:10] ANSWER.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; SO, SHE'S COMING FOR AN ANSWER. AND THE
[1:54:15] PROPHET, HE WOULD TRY TO TOUCH THE uh uh
[1:54:18] the unconscious realm, that realm where
[1:54:22] faith IS AND TRY TO SPEAK TO HER SO THAT
[1:54:27] FAITH COULD RAISE. WHAT IS FAITH? A
[1:54:30] REVELATION
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; SO THAT SHE COULD GET A REVELATION AND
[1:54:34] ACTUALLY SEE IF SHE HAD A COMPLETE
[1:54:36] REVELATION, SHE WOULD SEE HER HUSBAND
[1:54:39] ACTUALLY HEALED.
[1:54:41] FOR FAITH IS THE SUBSTANCE OF THINGS
[1:54:44] HOPED FOR, THE EVIDENCE OF THINGS NOT
[1:54:47] SEEN.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT COMING OUT OF THE PROPHET'S
[1:54:52] MOUTH THAT COULD SEPARATE BETWEEN THE
[1:54:55] AGONY AND THE TURMOIL and the emotion of
[1:54:58] her whole being AND THIS CATASTROPHIC
[1:55:01] THING THAT'S HAPPENING? He would say,
[1:55:04] "For the word," now don't get ahead of
[1:55:06] me. "For the word of God,
[1:55:10] the word of God
[1:55:13] is quick and powerful
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; and sharper than any two-edged sword,
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; piercing even to
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; even to the dividing of sunder of soul
[1:55:30] and spirit."
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Not
[1:55:33] spirit and body,
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; BUT SOUL AND SPIRIT.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; SATAN IN Satan's Eden has GOT HIS HIS
[1:55:42] FORCES SO customized and customized a
[1:55:46] thing for the people of this age that
[1:55:48] he's ACTUALLY GETTING THEIR BODY AND
[1:55:51] THEIR SPIRIT ALMOST MERGED into one.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:55:59] But when it comes to the word of God,
[1:56:01] the word of GOD COMES AND SO YOU SAY,
[1:56:03] "WELL, WELL, WE'RE IN LOVE FOR this
[1:56:05] reason or or and we have a a serious
[1:56:09] sickness or we have a at a time of
[1:56:13] death, the the the emotion and
[1:56:16] everything and people get get to the
[1:56:19] point,
[1:56:21] excuse me,
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; they'll say, "Ah, I went through such an
[1:56:27] experience
[1:56:28] I had such an experience with God. I can
[1:56:31] never be the same.
[1:56:34] Yeah, I've heard it too. 6 months down
[1:56:37] the road, they're exactly the same.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll, are you questioning the
[1:56:45] experience? Not a bit.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; It's just that the experience was so
[1:56:48] close.
[1:56:51] The soul
[1:56:54] and the spirit was so close that it was
[1:56:57] all in the spirit realm.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; And then you have to say, well, okay,
[1:57:09] I'm going deep now. Then you have to
[1:57:12] say, well, then what? Why did I have
[1:57:15] that experience? Well, you need to check
[1:57:17] it out.
[1:57:19] Is it something in your memory?
[1:57:22] Something in your conscience?
[1:57:25] Is it something in your imagination?
[1:57:27] Something that has loomed up and in your
[1:57:30] imagination say, "Yeah,
[1:57:33] I know I'll never be the same." You
[1:57:35] know, I was so close to mommy or so
[1:57:38] close to daddy or uh I just have such an
[1:57:42] experience with God. I just felt shivers
[1:57:46] go all over me. friends has nothing to
[1:57:49] do with it.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; People are here at the altar, they weep,
[1:57:57] they pound the altar. I've prayed with
[1:57:59] people, they pound the altar.
[1:58:02] Brother Brown talks about the preachers
[1:58:04] that get on the pulpit, get get on the
[1:58:07] platform and then they start telling
[1:58:09] they preach and the people feel pricked
[1:58:11] and then they start telling a sad story
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; and jerk some tears out of the people
[1:58:18] and brother Brandham get against that
[1:58:20] because all it touched was the emotions
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; and the people and then as soon as they
[1:58:26] walk out there's hordes of hell and
[1:58:28] Satan there and said you didn't get
[1:58:30] anything. Look, look at all the trouble
[1:58:32] you have now. And said, "Yeah, maybe I
[1:58:34] guess I guess I didn't get it."
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; You got to give me a few minutes.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; If you get weary, I'll have you stand up
[1:58:47] and shake hands. But if you can hang on
[1:58:49] for a little bit,
[1:58:55] the Bible says,
[1:58:58] "He came under his own, his own received
[1:59:00] him not." And then the and the word was
[1:59:04] made flesh.
[1:59:06] The word the word.
[1:59:09] It wasn't amen, hallelujah, glory to
[1:59:11] God. That was made flesh.
[1:59:14] It wasn't, "Oh my Jesus, I love you. I
[1:59:16] know thou art mine." That isn't what was
[1:59:18] made flesh. There's no sound that I know
[1:59:21] of that was made flesh. Brother Bram
[1:59:23] says that that which came out of the
[1:59:25] bosom of the father, which was the
[1:59:27] logos, which was the word. But as far as
[1:59:29] I know, there's no verbiage, there's no
[1:59:31] sound, there's no sentence.
[1:59:35] What was made flesh?
[1:59:39] The revelation of God
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; was made flesh.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; The revelation of God WAS MADE FLESH.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS IN [screaming] CHRIST.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Now listen very close.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:58] Hallelujah.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; And so after that, God had dwelt here
[2:00:02] for some time and had gathered some men
[2:00:05] around him and they didn't even KNOW
[2:00:07] EXACTLY WHY THEY WERE FOLLOWING HIM.
[2:00:09] COME AND follow me. I'll make you
[2:00:11] fishers of men.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody said, "Boy, that sounds
[2:00:14] interesting."
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; But there was something deeper.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus has his disciples around
[2:00:20] him. Follow me very close now because
[2:00:22] this is key to the service.
[2:00:27] Who do men say I am?
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOUR PROPHET returned
[2:00:33] to that scripture?
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A FOUNDATION TO THE WHOLE
[2:00:37] MESSAGE.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONE HE'S
[2:00:41] REPRESENTING.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S the one he's revealing.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; WHO DO MEN SAY I AM?
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; I AM.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Some say you're Elias or Elijah. What
[2:00:52] are THEY DOING? THEY'RE BACK IN THEIR
[2:00:53] MEMORY CHANNEL. WON'T work
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; or one of the other prophets.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU SAY
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; I AM?
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; LISTEN CLOSE. NOW,
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; THIS PHRASE HAS NEVER BEEN SPOKEN
[2:01:11] BEFORE.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; THOU ART THE CHRIST,
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD.
[2:01:20] BLESSED ART THOU, SIMON BARJONAH.
[2:01:24] FLESH AND BLOOD HAS NOT REVEALED THIS TO
[2:01:27] YOU.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; BUT MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; IF YOU TOOK THAT SENTENCE
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; and rearranged it,
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; it doesn't mean anything.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; IT ISN'T JUST THE WORDS. It was the uh h
[2:01:49] association and the arrangement of the
[2:01:52] words THOU ART THE CHRIST. THERE'S
[2:01:57] NOTHING SACRED ABOUT THOU or art or
[2:02:00] Christ is an anointed one.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; But the ARRANGEMENT IS THOU ART THE
[2:02:07] CHRIST.
[2:02:08] WHEN I SAY don't ever think that, don't
[2:02:11] ever think it the way you thought it
[2:02:13] before. When I say this message IS JESUS
[2:02:18] CHRIST,
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; IT'S THAT CHRIST I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY THEY WORSHIPED HIM AND
[2:02:29] GAVE THEIR LIVES TO HIM BECAUSE THEY SAW
[2:02:32] WHO HE WAS.
[2:02:37] THEY ACTUALLY WERE WORSHIPING ON THE
[2:02:39] BASIS OF THEIR REVELATION
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; AND THE REVELATION CAME FROM GOD AND
[2:02:45] BECAME HIM. HE WAS THE REVELATION
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; AND PETER CAME TO HE BROTHER PETER CAME
[2:02:53] TO WORSHIP.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; HE CAME TO WORSHIP him
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; because even after THAT HE WAS STILL
[2:03:00] WEAK. HE STILL HE STILL SET some curses
[2:03:02] at the at Calvary,
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; but he was birthed again
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; and he came to it.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Listen to me closely.
[2:03:15] It has TO SAY SOMETHING SPECIFIC INSIDE.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; You can't JUST GO OUT AND SAY, "OH, that
[2:03:22] was a wonderful service."
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; NO. WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?
[2:03:28] I'M PREACHING TODAY THAT YOU CAN GO OUT
[2:03:31] OF HERE AND SAID, "I MET HIM AGAIN."
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; I ACTUALLY MET HIM AGAIN.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; It would be my REWARD TO HAVE PEOPLE
[2:03:42] SAY, "I EMBRACED HIM AGAIN." AND HE
[2:03:45] EMBRACED ME AGAIN.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT SERVICE.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; I FELT HIS ARMS AROUND ME.
[2:03:56] HALLELUJAH. NOT AN EMOTIONAL REALM, BUT
[2:03:58] IT was an experience.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; You say, "Can it be that real?"
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother, my sister, can be that
[2:04:05] REAL BECAUSE THOSE SAME MEN WENT AND and
[2:04:08] went to the martyrdom
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; and gave their lives.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said they would
[2:04:15] never have given their lives for some
[2:04:17] just some dead formal thing.
[2:04:21] Amen.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; I took and tried to arrange it and I
[2:04:26] couldn't make any sense of it. So I just
[2:04:28] I didn't have enough time. But thou art
[2:04:32] the Christ. Those words by themselves
[2:04:36] have no significance.
[2:04:40] You could put son over here and go over
[2:04:42] here and living somewhere else.
[2:04:46] Those words by themselves don't have the
[2:04:48] meaning. So whatever spoke,
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Peter heard
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; the voice of God.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; And he received a revelation.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; You can hear the voice OF GOD AND STILL
[2:05:02] MAKE A MISTAKE. HE MADE A MISTAKE.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; He cursed at Calvary at the time of the
[2:05:07] judgment.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; That was that that wasn't that wasn't
[2:05:11] because of his revelation.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand me. Amen.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; You might not have had anything to do
[2:05:19] with him after that, but God did
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; and he became he became the one who had
[2:05:24] the keys to the kingdom
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST KNEW WHAT HE WAS
[2:05:29] GOING TO DO WITH THAT REVELATION.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; And that's why he COULD STAND ON THE day
[2:05:34] of PENTECOST BECAUSE IT HAD THE KEYS AND
[2:05:36] SAY, "HEAR ME."
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; I GOT A MESSAGE NOW. HEAR ME.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:54] I want to take one more.
[2:05:57] Saul
[2:05:59] of Tarsus who became Apostle Paul.
[2:06:03] And the Bible says in Acts the 9th
[2:06:06] chapter where it happened, it's recorded
[2:06:08] the happening.
[2:06:12] Listen close.
[2:06:16] And he fell to the earth and heard a
[2:06:19] voice saying,
[2:06:24] "Saul, Saul,
[2:06:27] why persecutest thou me?
[2:06:30] It is hard for thee to kick against the
[2:06:32] pricks."
[2:06:35] That's a very specific sentence.
[2:06:39] And the scripture tells us
[2:06:43] because he relates it later in when he's
[2:06:46] before I think Fesus. He says, "And I
[2:06:49] fell to the ground and I heard a voice
[2:06:52] saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why
[2:06:54] persecutest thou me?" And I answered,
[2:06:59] "Who art thou, Lord?"
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Now, here we are in English. Saul, Saul,
[2:07:03] what the sounds that are reaching your
[2:07:05] ears isn't what Saul heard,
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Because I know it wasn't in English. He
[2:07:12] said it was in the Hebrew tongue.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; So God was speaking to him in Hebrew.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; And he heard why speak why persecutest
[2:07:21] thou me and I fell to the ground. Now he
[2:07:23] fell to the ground. When you fall to the
[2:07:26] ground and brother Brandham gives it
[2:07:27] very very clearly. He said he would I'm
[2:07:30] going to read it for you. He said he
[2:07:32] WOULDN'T HAVE WORSHIPED AN IDOL.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; AS SOON AS THE REVELATION CAME, WORSHIP
[2:07:39] CAME.
[2:07:51] I don't know when ever I'll preach like
[2:07:53] this again, but
[2:07:56] I've been trying on a couple of
[2:07:58] occasions to come to a place of
[2:08:05] I feel that if we
[2:08:08] obtain
[2:08:10] the kind of revelation, the kind of
[2:08:13] experience
[2:08:15] that we have that we should have
[2:08:20] and have had. I have no doubt that many
[2:08:22] of you have had it
[2:08:25] that
[2:08:27] it's followed by an extreme reverence.
[2:08:32] You find it often where they fell. And
[2:08:35] not just one of the last times I tried
[2:08:38] to bring that I I fell to my knees here.
[2:08:43] Not to be demonstrative
[2:08:45] but to depict what happens in the
[2:08:47] scripture
[2:08:49] and they fell.
[2:08:53] The angels came at Christ's birth to the
[2:08:56] shepherds and the shepherds fell. The
[2:09:00] Bible says a place they and I went to
[2:09:02] Ruth. Now I'm giving you where I went.
[2:09:05] And I talked about Ruth and when Boaz
[2:09:08] came said stay in the field. Stay here.
[2:09:11] You know, and she and when she saw that
[2:09:13] she came under his vision and under his
[2:09:18] attention.
[2:09:19] The Bible says she fell on her face.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Why would you have such grace?
[2:09:30] Hallelujah.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Why have you focused on me?
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; What is it that you've seen?
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; What grace is this?
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; That I SHOULD BE FOUND IN Boaz's field.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; And such reverence.
[2:09:50] And friends,
[2:09:53] that's the thing that's missing
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; in the message today.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Is that kind of reverence,
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Falling to your knees and falling on
[2:10:07] your face doesn't do it. But it's what
[2:10:10] happens as a result of
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; the meeting, the revelation
[2:10:18] of God. And so the Bible says of Apostle
[2:10:21] Paul,
[2:10:22] "Who art thou Lord? I'm Jesus whom thou
[2:10:25] persecutest."
[2:10:27] He said, "And they that were with me,
[2:10:29] they saw indeed the light.
[2:10:32] They saw the light, and they were
[2:10:33] afraid. They had that emotion,
[2:10:37] but they heard not the voice of him that
[2:10:39] spake. They didn't hear. They didn't
[2:10:42] hear the words. You've heard me say it
[2:10:44] before, but now it comes with such a new
[2:10:46] strength and meaning. They didn't hear
[2:10:48] Saul. SAUL, WHY PERSECUTEST thou me?
[2:10:51] That's what they didn't hear. They maybe
[2:10:53] heard a big sound or or whether they
[2:10:56] heard anything. They saw a light that
[2:10:58] drove them to the earth. But they
[2:11:01] didn't. Neither did they obtain the
[2:11:03] revelation THAT THIS WAS CHRIST
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; THE PERSON. He didn't JUST LOOK AT HIM.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; HE GAVE HIM HIS LIFE FROM THERE ON TO
[2:11:11] HIS DEATH.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; I MUST go to Rome.
[2:11:16] But don't GO TO ROME. I MUST GO to
[2:11:19] Jerusalem. And they they theypt on his
[2:11:22] shoulder. It's the last time YOU SEE ME.
[2:11:24] I'M ON MY way to Rome.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to die in Rome.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Nothing meant anything ANYMORE BECAUSE
[2:11:33] HE MET THE PERSON.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; He knew he had A MISSION TO FILL.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; AND NOW HE COULD SAY, "I FINISHED MY
[2:11:39] COURSE.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; I'VE RUN THE RACE. HENCEFORTH THERE'S A
[2:11:44] CROWN LAID UP FOR ME.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:11:57] [snorts]
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; I can take you to other places in the
[2:12:05] scripture
[2:12:07] but we haven't got time.
[2:12:12] But I will just say to this
[2:12:13] congregation,
[2:12:16] to all on the internet, God bless you.
[2:12:19] Thank you for your prayers.
[2:12:23] Thank you for your emails.
[2:12:26] Thank you for your gifts that help it
[2:12:29] help us to continue doing what it is
[2:12:31] we're doing.
[2:12:39] Now, here's a difficult little short
[2:12:41] quote, but it's right. It thought of
[2:12:45] Christ as the mystery of God revealed.
[2:12:47] And I'm going to close.
[2:12:51] He said, "Look,
[2:12:54] Christ in you
[2:12:57] makes him the center of life
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; of the revelation."
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; You have a revelation.
[2:13:07] But he said Christ in you
[2:13:11] makes him the center
[2:13:14] of life of the revelation.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; And then Christ's life in you
[2:13:22] makes him the center of the revelation.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; He said Christ in the Bible makes the
[2:13:29] Bible a complete revelation of Christ.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Christ in the Bible. Christ in the
[2:13:37] Bible. I'll tell you what friends, this
[2:13:39] revelation of when I came to know and
[2:13:43] came to understand
[2:13:46] uh the doctrines of the message and took
[2:13:48] it to the Bible. This Bible exploded
[2:13:51] with life.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; But I found that he who is the center of
[2:13:55] that life was none other than Christ.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; It was Christ who was the center of that
[2:14:00] life. AND YOU ENTER INTO RELATIONSHIP
[2:14:03] WITH HIM.
[2:14:04] RIGHT.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; It's easy to sing my Jesus.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; I love thee.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; I know thou art mine.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; For thee all the follyies of sin I
[2:14:19] resign.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; My gracious redeemer, my savior art
[2:14:23] thou.
[2:14:25] If ever I love thee,
[2:14:28] my Jesus is now.
[2:14:39] It's my New Year's message.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; It's what we need in 2012.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; It's what we need.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:53] I see you girls here,
[2:14:58] young ladies,
[2:15:00] you young fellas.
[2:15:02] You see b with his white hair. I was
[2:15:05] your age once.
[2:15:07] I was your age. I sat in meetings just
[2:15:10] like this.
[2:15:13] Sister Ruth sat in meetings just like
[2:15:15] you girls from the time she was a small
[2:15:17] girl. Her daddy wasn't saved. Her daddy
[2:15:20] was a businessman.
[2:15:23] He was busy. He was curling and playing
[2:15:26] golf in the summer. But he was a
[2:15:27] wonderful man.
[2:15:30] And I realize this is on the internet,
[2:15:32] but I'm going to say it anyway,
[2:15:35] but her home was broken
[2:15:39] and mommy was down in the US
[2:15:42] in Montana
[2:15:45] [clears throat] and daddy was up north
[2:15:47] in business. And she and her daddy lived
[2:15:49] alone
[2:15:50] while she was 11 and 12.
[2:15:54] She played the piano
[2:15:57] and had a wonderful voice.
[2:16:00] And there was a broadcast on the radio
[2:16:02] at 7:00 in the morning.
[2:16:05] Sing them over again to me. Wonderful
[2:16:08] words of life. And the minister would
[2:16:10] come and get her. They live just not
[2:16:12] very far apart. And knock on the door.
[2:16:15] There she was at 12, 13 years old going
[2:16:17] down to the radio station to play the
[2:16:19] piano because everything had to be live.
[2:16:22] Listen
[2:16:24] friends, you look at brother and sister
[2:16:26] Bisco sitting here.
[2:16:28] I had to leave home when I was 15. I
[2:16:30] hadn't had come to 16th birthday yet. I
[2:16:32] was 15. I've been 16 in
[2:16:36] October, but I was 15. It was the end of
[2:16:39] May. And I got on the train and went
[2:16:42] over a,000 miles and went to work on a
[2:16:45] farm.
[2:16:50] And that was the last I had a home.
[2:16:54] And I moved about 11 times in a few
[2:16:57] years
[2:16:58] from one farm to another to another.
[2:17:02] I'll tell you something else.
[2:17:07] [snorts]
[2:17:09] One day I met him.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; One day I met him.
[2:17:16] And I could do bad things, but I can
[2:17:18] never forget that meeting.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; He's a different kind of a person.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; You'll never forget that kind of person.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; And some of you here are struggling.
[2:17:36] I'm telling you right now,
[2:17:39] your struggles can end today.
[2:17:44] This one I'm talking about is here.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; And it wants to come by your way.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; It want to change your situation.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; There isn't any situation that he can't
[2:18:00] handle.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; He's one he listen to me friends. I know
[2:18:05] there's lots of problems and lots of
[2:18:07] troubles and difficulty, but this one
[2:18:09] that I met, he he threw the stars in
[2:18:13] space,
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; the planets.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; One of one day he said to his prophet,
[2:18:21] "Where's my family?
[2:18:25] All the heavens, my hands made them. I
[2:18:28] had stars by the billions. I got planets
[2:18:32] and galaxies and all these things in the
[2:18:35] earth I made. It's my foottool.
[2:18:39] Where's my family? Where's my children?
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Where's my household?
[2:18:45] I I can't have a relationship with the
[2:18:47] planet.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Where's somebody that came out from me
[2:18:51] who loves me?
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want people just jumping
[2:18:56] around saying, "I'm a seed. I'm a seed,
[2:18:58] Jean." He wants to have a relationship.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; And lots of times, don't don't use the
[2:19:09] excuse. Well, I didn't have a
[2:19:11] relationship here. I didn't have a
[2:19:12] father. I didn't have a mother. I come
[2:19:14] from hard time. I'm just telling you
[2:19:16] about sister Bisco and I. We both come
[2:19:17] from hard times.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Very hard times.
[2:19:25] But we're going to a better time.
[2:19:28] And we're not sorry for one second for
[2:19:30] the life that we live that you could
[2:19:32] live and to come to know him.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you this testimony today. We
[2:19:38] come to know a person.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; And this message didn't come to make
[2:19:44] William Brandham some great person
[2:19:45] that's untouchable. That isn't why he
[2:19:48] came.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; He sent him as the last one in his hand.
[2:19:52] Elijah, I said, "Go
[2:19:56] to this cursed dark leodyian age and
[2:20:01] tell them and show them who I am."
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; In one last attempt.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. in one last desperate attempt
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; to have a people. And we can be all
[2:20:16] wallowed up in all kinds of oh glitter
[2:20:20] and all the all the holidays and all the
[2:20:23] stuff just stuff.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; ALL TAKE IT up with it.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Preach it, brother.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; The young people are going to education.
[2:20:34] Get all the education that you need.
[2:20:38] But I wouldn't bother with anymore.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; It's not going to do you a whole lot of
[2:20:43] good.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Get all the money you can get and give
[2:20:47] all that you can get.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; And be a good steward.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:58] Don't get in the flesh and look at
[2:20:59] somebody say, "Well, you know,
[2:21:04] people put a picture of my house on the
[2:21:07] internet.
[2:21:10] How unkind.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; That's fine.
[2:21:14] Do what they want to do."
[2:21:19] My daddy died
[2:21:21] and left 32 cents in the bank. 32 cents.
[2:21:29] I worked for years
[2:21:32] and supported myself. Brother Brandham
[2:21:33] said he did for about 17 years. I did
[2:21:36] for at least 10
[2:21:39] because I wanted anything that came in
[2:21:41] to be able to go out. Paid brother Roger
[2:21:44] Smith a salary and let the rest go and
[2:21:47] let the tapes go and just do whatever we
[2:21:49] can. Brother Lance Laru made tapes in
[2:21:53] the basement of our office.
[2:21:55] In one year, just under 100,000 tapes.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's where Brother Lance just after he
[2:22:01] got saved a while. That's where he met
[2:22:03] Tammy, his wife.
[2:22:07] She came from Ohio just to open up
[2:22:09] letters and to help respond. Friends, I
[2:22:12] say in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:22:14] Christ, this is the course
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; and I will not change that course. Amen.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; This is the call,
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; brother Ernie. Whether it's good times
[2:22:24] or whether it's hard times, whether
[2:22:25] people want to tell the truth or whether
[2:22:27] want whatever the devil wants to do, I'm
[2:22:29] not interested what the devil wants to
[2:22:31] do.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested what the devil wants
[2:22:33] to do.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, we're talking about
[2:22:39] reality.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, why don't you
[2:22:41] mention that?" You know, the reason I
[2:22:42] don't mention that because I feel I feel
[2:22:45] about that big. I hear some of these
[2:22:47] people that have come from the Congo and
[2:22:48] what they've experienced and what
[2:22:50] they've gone through
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; and I wouldn't I just tell you I admire
[2:22:54] them.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; I admire them and I think they know
[2:22:59] that.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; I admire them greatly
[2:23:03] and I say to you younger generation
[2:23:06] with your mothers and fathers and what
[2:23:08] they've gone through don't get caught up
[2:23:10] in the easy life
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; of this generation. remain dedicated,
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; remain separated.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't met this person,
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; he's there for you to meet.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; And that's my message today.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Don't just expect to just hear certain
[2:23:31] words put together. Say, I want to
[2:23:34] exercise
[2:23:35] that inner I've heard, but now I want to
[2:23:38] see.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; I want to exercise that faculty inside.
[2:23:45] Speak to me, Lord.
[2:23:48] Let's bow our heads.
[2:23:52] [snorts]
[2:24:02] Lord Jesus, I'm
[2:24:04] standing here feeling trembling,
[2:24:09] not knowing just what you would have me
[2:24:13] to do. But I pray that you will do your
[2:24:15] own will. Do your own purpose.
[2:24:18] Work it in the hearts of these people.
[2:24:20] Lord,
[2:24:22] I'm praying for a great transformation
[2:24:25] in Cloverdale Bible way.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; I pray that I pray that 2012
[2:24:32] or the coming days, we're not looking
[2:24:34] way down the year, but I pray that in
[2:24:37] just the coming days,
[2:24:40] I ask that there will be a marked
[2:24:42] difference. Oh God,
[2:24:44] in the lives of the people
[2:24:47] and may your word which has been spoken
[2:24:49] through such a precious instrument,
[2:24:52] you sent Malachi 4. Yes, you sent a a
[2:24:56] vindicated prophet. I've seen that
[2:24:58] vindication all these years. I've been
[2:25:01] so moved, so moved.
[2:25:04] And I know we know now why you did it.
[2:25:07] You did it, Lord. That you could that we
[2:25:10] could see you. And I pray, I ask, oh
[2:25:14] Lord Jesus, that the this congregation
[2:25:16] of people and those on the internet when
[2:25:19] they are hearing these words,
[2:25:22] they will turn and look inward
[2:25:25] and hear your voice speaking to them.
[2:25:29] You spoke to Saul, Saul, Saul, why
[2:25:33] persecutest thou me? And you transformed
[2:25:36] him, oh God, into one of the mightiest
[2:25:39] apostles that wrote the New Testament
[2:25:42] mostly.
[2:25:44] Lord God, you spoke to Peter. You gave
[2:25:48] him a revelation that no rabbi or no
[2:25:51] parent, none of his parents could give
[2:25:53] it. And you told him, Jesus, flesh and
[2:25:56] blood has not revealed it unto thee. And
[2:25:59] I move today, Lord, because I know that
[2:26:02] no flesh or blood how my father I loved
[2:26:06] him and how my wife's father I loved him
[2:26:10] and oh God even the prophet himself and
[2:26:14] sitting with him and hearing the words
[2:26:17] that he spoke out of his mouth but oh
[2:26:21] God is as marvelous as that was
[2:26:25] it only led me into a deeper walk a
[2:26:28] deeper life with you and that I can
[2:26:30] never forget Lord please Lord Jesus I
[2:26:34] pray that there'll be young and old here
[2:26:37] that will reach out, Father, and perhaps
[2:26:39] say
[2:26:41] something more, something more, more of
[2:26:44] you, Lord.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; More of you. I just need more of you.
[2:26:49] Speak, Lord. Speak my Lord, and I will
[2:26:51] do what you tell me to do. Let there be
[2:26:54] a consecrated life, Father. Many lives
[2:26:57] here now. These people are so precious
[2:27:00] and how we we appreciate them.
[2:27:05] I pray, Father, that you will make great
[2:27:08] changes
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; from the ministry
[2:27:12] to the deacons
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; in the lives of the trustees. Our
[2:27:16] brother
[2:27:18] Nathaniel Iverson's not here today, but
[2:27:21] we pray you'll bless him and Shelley
[2:27:24] with their loved ones
[2:27:26] and this congregation. Oh God,
[2:27:29] Father,
[2:27:31] Father, they're your children.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; They're your sheep, the sheep of your
[2:27:36] fold.
[2:27:38] Let them, I pray, taste of your nearness
[2:27:41] and your presence, Lord. And we're going
[2:27:44] to take a few moments now so that you
[2:27:48] can speak and say what you wish to say.
[2:27:51] Lord Jesus, I want to dedicate myself
[2:27:56] for the future. Father, whatever time
[2:27:58] you give us, forgive us our wrongs.
[2:28:02] Forgive us our lacks for being lax. Oh
[2:28:05] God,
[2:28:07] cause us not to live for self. Father,
[2:28:10] cause us, I pray, to live for the
[2:28:12] kingdom of God and to do all that we can
[2:28:15] in Jesus Christ's name. I ask that
[2:28:18] you'll bless these that are giving so
[2:28:21] much. Lord,
[2:28:23] in Africa when we see brother Bus and
[2:28:26] brother Mumba and these different ones,
[2:28:29] Lord, I pray that you will bless the
[2:28:31] bride, brother Dioa.
[2:28:34] Oh God, brother Caillou, men who've
[2:28:36] become very dear to us, who've
[2:28:39] sacrificed so much. I pray, oh God, that
[2:28:42] you will remember us. And now as we are
[2:28:45] beginning this new year, I ask in the
[2:28:49] name of Jesus that even at this moment,
[2:28:52] the Holy Spirit will come upon our young
[2:28:55] people, young men and young women who
[2:28:58] will rise and say, "I rise to take my
[2:29:01] stand amongst the righteous ones." Oh
[2:29:05] God, if there are those that are not yet
[2:29:07] full of your spirit, I pray that before
[2:29:10] the sun goes down today, they will be
[2:29:13] charged with the Holy Ghost,
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; charged with your spirit of God,
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. I thank you for
[2:29:23] hearing me. Thank you for this
[2:29:24] opportunity to speak to these precious
[2:29:27] people.
[2:29:29] May these words remain with them. I pray
[2:29:33] Jesus name.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Like to sing more of you Lord. More of
[2:29:39] you. Would you stand with me?
[2:29:44] [music]
[2:29:51] [music]
[2:29:59] for of [music and singing] you.
[2:30:06] I had it all, [singing and music]
[2:30:09] but what I need is more [singing]
[2:30:14] of you.
[2:30:19] of [music] things [singing] I can
[2:30:23] feel.
[2:30:26] But yet [music]
[2:30:27] I [singing]
[2:30:28] [chant]
[2:30:29] see
[2:30:33] empty and [music]
[2:30:36] Lord hear [singing] my prayer for
[2:30:41] [music] you.
[2:30:44] Now we raise our hearts down of you.
[2:30:49] More [music] of you.
[2:30:52] More [singing]
[2:30:54] of you.
[2:30:59] I [singing] have it all. [music]
[2:31:02] But what I need is all
[2:31:07] [music] you.
[2:31:12] All things [music and singing] I had my
[2:31:18] but [music and singing]
[2:31:20] I hunger
[2:31:25] empty [music and singing]
[2:31:27] and
[2:31:29] Lord hear my prayer [music] for
[2:31:34] [singing] you.
[2:31:38] empty and bare. [singing]
[2:31:41] Lord, hear my prayer. [music]
[2:31:44] Lord, [singing]
[2:31:46] let's hear your voices now.
[2:31:50] Oh, empty [music] and
[2:31:54] Lord [singing] my prayer for
[2:31:59] you.
[2:32:02] [music]
[2:32:04] I think it would be good for us to start
[2:32:06] this year with a complete dedication.
[2:32:08] [music]
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Dedication of ourselves. Let us be a
[2:32:12] dedication service.
[2:32:16] Pass me not, oh gentle [music] Savior,
[2:32:24] [singing]
[2:32:26] [music]
[2:32:27] and hear
[2:32:30] [singing] my humble.
[2:32:33] [music]
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; If you've never prayed it before, do it
[2:32:37] now. Do it now. [music]
[2:32:40] While
[2:32:43] on the offers [singing]
[2:32:45] now our calling,
[2:32:49] [music and singing]
[2:32:50] call out to him.
[2:32:52] Do
[2:32:55] not pass
[2:32:57] me [music and singing]
[2:32:59] by.
[2:33:01] Let's put it down just a little bit.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; in your [singing]
[2:33:13] savior.
[2:33:17] The Lord Jesus [music] such his name
[2:33:20] [singing]
[2:33:21] my
[2:33:26] [music]
[2:33:30] [singing]
[2:33:35] [music and singing]
[2:33:37] holy
[2:33:40] [music and singing] calling
[2:33:43] do
[2:33:45] not pass [singing]
[2:33:48] [music] me by.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Before we sing that verse and that
[2:33:54] chorus again, [music]
[2:33:57] it just might be that there's someone.
[2:34:01] It's kind of where I'm at. [music]
[2:34:04] I just want to dedicate and lay it on.
[2:34:07] Whatever you say, Lord, that's what I
[2:34:10] want to do. [music]
[2:34:12] Time is slipping away from us so
[2:34:14] quickly.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; So quickly.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; So quickly.
[2:34:27] Sister Karen
[2:34:29] Adidone is here and [music]
[2:34:33] your brother's life and what happened.
[2:34:35] Sister Karen has so spoken to [music] my
[2:34:37] heart. But let us speak to this whole
[2:34:39] congregation. Yeah.
[2:34:43] [music]
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; He came in his sickness and weakness and
[2:34:46] saw what brother Kim and those were
[2:34:48] doing in the school
[2:34:50] and he went right back [music] to his
[2:34:51] shop and made some metal hangers for the
[2:34:54] ceiling.
[2:34:56] Metal hangers
[2:34:59] that Lyall Ficken made
[2:35:02] are hanging in the school.
[2:35:06] And we all expected
[2:35:09] that perhaps he'd be standing here with
[2:35:10] us. And a young man 45 [music] years
[2:35:14] old. Men,
[2:35:17] we have no assurance.
[2:35:21] You young men, young ladies, teenagers,
[2:35:26] we're not laying a heavy on you. You
[2:35:29] don't know anything about your future.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; The greatest thing you can [music] do
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; is give yourself to live a righteous
[2:35:40] life.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; Give. Say, I'm here to give myself. I'm
[2:35:45] here to give of myself. [music]
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; And parents like
[2:35:52] [music] and I'm just going to open the
[2:35:54] the front here if you want to come and
[2:36:00] say I'd like to make a statement. I
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; I really
[2:36:05] and you won't be looked down on if you
[2:36:07] don't come. That's fine. No, no. I just
[2:36:08] want those that feel they need to.
[2:36:13] Maybe things have been slipping [music]
[2:36:14] in and other things have been priorities
[2:36:19] and you want that all to change.
[2:36:22] [music]
[2:36:25] Don't come down without remembering the
[2:36:27] words that the one of whom I speak
[2:36:30] is here. [music]
[2:36:33] The one of whom I met is here.
[2:36:42] You [music] can meet him.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; Tell him what's in your heart [music]
[2:36:50] while we sing it again. Sing that first
[2:36:53] verse, brother. [music]
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; That's fine. Let's call out to him.
[2:37:05] [music]
[2:37:12] [music]
[2:37:12] [singing]
[2:37:14] my own
[2:37:18] cry. [music]
[2:37:24] And while
[2:37:26] [music]
[2:37:28] on others
[2:37:32] so much [music]
[2:37:36] on the kingdom,
[2:37:40] [music]
[2:37:44] oh God, [music] oh God, oh wonder, do I
[2:37:48] pray,
[2:37:49] give me
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; A meeting will cause
[2:37:57] [singing]
[2:37:59] somebody with you Lord.
[2:38:02] [music] Can somebody have a meeting with
[2:38:04] you?
[2:38:06] [singing]
[2:38:08] [music]
[2:38:13] Oh [music] God, let's be
[2:38:18] the deep beating.
[2:38:21] [music]
[2:38:25] Yes, Lord.

[2:38:35] [music] Oh, reach out to him. Oh, save.

[2:39:01] so thirsty, Lord. We're so thirsty,
[2:39:03] Lord. I'm so thirsty, Lord. [music] I'm
[2:39:07] hungry after you.
[2:39:10] Hungry after you. Reach to you.
[2:39:15] [music]
[2:39:17] Oh [singing]
[2:39:18] God, we're hungry after you.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh God.
[2:39:27] Friends, I'm so hungry after him.
[2:39:30] I know just hanging right here over us
[2:39:33] right now. And he's I know that [music]
[2:39:35] his presence is moving around you,
[2:39:37] surrounding you. Just yield to him. Just
[2:39:42] yield to him. Speak what's in your
[2:39:44] heart. [music]
[2:39:46] If you're hungering after him, I'm so
[2:39:49] hungry for you, Lord.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; I'm just reaching out, Lord. Let let
[2:39:53] what's in my soul touch you.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; Come and touch my own heart, oh God.
[2:39:59] Break down any resistance. [music] Break
[2:40:00] down any hardness. Those things that
[2:40:03] have been separating our fellowship, oh
[2:40:05] God, remove them out of my heart. Oh
[2:40:08] God, this missing life, oh God. Oh God,
[2:40:14] may we take [music] control of it, Lord,
[2:40:16] for the glory of God. May we give
[2:40:19] ourselves to you unreservedly. We give
[2:40:21] ourselves to you. [music]
[2:40:23] Forgive us Lord for becoming so occupied
[2:40:26] in this life. Forgive us oh God. Let us
[2:40:29] live for eternity and for eternal
[2:40:31] things. We consecrate ourselves Lord. I
[2:40:35] consecrate myself. Whatever it costs,
[2:40:38] whatever it is, whatever the cost. Oh
[2:40:41] God. [music]
[2:40:42] Oh God. I'll do what you want me to do.
[2:40:46] I'll be what you want me to be. I'll go
[2:40:49] where you want me to go, God. Whatever
[2:40:52] it is, Lord, let the effects of this
[2:40:55] service, let the effects of this
[2:40:57] congregation reach out, oh father, into
[2:41:00] other lands, other places. Oh Lord, in
[2:41:03] our community, oh God, we need
[2:41:05] something. We need something happening
[2:41:07] within our own congregation. Lord, we've
[2:41:10] been hungering after and they've been
[2:41:11] thirsting after you.
[2:41:14] Oh God, give people an experience that
[2:41:16] they've never even thought of before.
[2:41:18] They didn't even know existed before.
[2:41:21] Break down every wall. Lord, bring down
[2:41:23] every resistance. Oh God, may Satan be
[2:41:26] thoroughly defeated here, Father.
[2:41:30] Hallelujah. In the name of the Lord
[2:41:33] Jesus Christ,
[2:41:35] you have liberty to pray. You have
[2:41:37] liberty to call upon him. Oh, he's given
[2:41:40] you words. Let the voice of your words
[2:41:43] be heard.
[2:41:46] My Lord. Yes. Oh God.
[2:41:49] Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. [music]
[2:41:53] Oh God.
[2:41:56] Oh God. Oh God.

[2:42:02] the Lord. [music]
[2:42:05] Oh God. Oh God.
[2:42:12] [music]
[2:42:13] Let's all raise our hands in dedication
[2:42:17] &gt;&gt; and you tell them how you're dedicating
[2:42:19] yourself to [music] him.
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to begin this first
[2:42:24] service in this new year
[2:42:28] in dedication and how you're prophet.
[2:42:30] Oh, how we respect the words you [music]
[2:42:32] spoke to him.
[2:42:34] How you've made yourself so known and so
[2:42:37] close and so real. Oh, God. I personally
[2:42:41] get so touched when I hear how tenderly
[2:42:44] you spoke to the people. How you desire
[2:42:48] to meet their needs, oh God, that you're
[2:42:51] so conscious. You're so aware. You're so
[2:42:54] present.
[2:42:56] We're raising our hands and raising our
[2:42:58] hearts to you.
[2:43:00] Giving ourselves unreservedly, oh God,
[2:43:03] to your will. We do not know how many
[2:43:06] days we have, Father, or months or
[2:43:08] years. Yes, Lord.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; Whatever the time may be, we want to
[2:43:12] live it for what is done for Christ.
[2:43:14] That is all it will last.
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; Take this word, oh God, and make it a
[2:43:19] quickened flame.
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; Within the lives of these individuals,
[2:43:25] Father,
[2:43:27] let your word burn like a fire, oh God,
[2:43:30] within our bones.
[2:43:33] Give us boldness
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; to be a bold witness for you. Doing as
[2:43:38] your prophet said, let the character,
[2:43:40] let the beauty
[2:43:42] of this congregation be the character of
[2:43:44] the people.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; Teach us, oh Lord, your ways.
[2:43:52] [music]
[2:43:55] Teach us your ways.

[2:45:44] There are some here perhaps including
[2:45:46] myself are facing decisions [music] and
[2:45:49] we don't know just exactly what to do.
[2:45:51] We want to do the right thing. [music]
[2:45:54] I believe that he will lead us in this
[2:45:57] atmosphere. I want to say to you,

[2:46:06] decision.
[2:46:09] [music] this one that you love and this
[2:46:12] one that loves you [music]
[2:46:15] so much.
[2:46:18] He'll never leave you. [music]
[2:46:22] He'll help you in the most critical
[2:46:24] time.
[2:46:25] [music]
[2:46:27] He'll give a spirit of wisdom to you.
[2:46:33] He'll be your counselor.
[2:46:37] He'll be your friend. [music]
[2:46:42] We surrender ourselves to him. [music]

[2:51:37] such a struggle.
[2:51:39] that how am I going to say this? How am
[2:51:42] I going to tell the people [music]

[2:51:51] precious you are to me. [music]
[2:51:53] Give them a taste of that same presence,
[2:51:55] that same atmosphere that was in the

[2:52:01] people didn't even take the message.
[2:52:02] They didn't any time for the message.
[2:52:05] And here we are. We love it. Friends,

[2:52:54] I'm not just going to look. Maybe you
[2:52:57] just had a look this morning, but I'm
[2:52:59] not going to just look.
