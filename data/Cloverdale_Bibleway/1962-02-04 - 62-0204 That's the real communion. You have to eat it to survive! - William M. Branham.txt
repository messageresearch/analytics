Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's Jesus Christ revealing Him just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and as the living father has sent me and I live by my father so he that eateth me even He Shall Live By Me In other words the father sent me and I live by him and every man that comes to Christ must live by Christ that's the communion that's the real communion is shouldi when you live by Christ now our bodies need food and drink each day to survive our physical body if we don't take food each day and drink then our body weaken there's something in us that we must have food one day's food will not last for the next day you've got to have food each day to strengthen your mortal being you can live over but you're weaker and the second day you're still weaker and and the third day you're getting tremendous weak well that's what many times that we do in the spiritual realm you see each day we've got to commune with Christ we've got to talk to him each day we've got to settle it with him each day Paul said I die each day see each day I die yet I live not me but Christ lives in me so if your physical body needs food each day and drink each day to survive your spiritual body needs spiritual food and commun with the Lord each day to survive
