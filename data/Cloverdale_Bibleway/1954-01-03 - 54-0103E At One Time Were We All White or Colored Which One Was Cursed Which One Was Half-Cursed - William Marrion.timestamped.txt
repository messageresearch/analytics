[0:00] at one
[0:02] time at one time were we all white our
[0:08] colored of the two which one was the
[0:12] curse put on
[0:15] now as far as we
[0:19] know I couldn't tell you where Adam and
[0:21] Eve were were white or brown or yellow
[0:27] or black I cannot tell you no one else
[0:30] knows but God alone I guess who is back
[0:33] there now in the as we come all as one
[0:37] language and one people until the Tower
[0:39] of Babel of confusion and then their
[0:42] languages went different and as far as
[0:45] we know they were all one peoples of
[0:48] that time and they broke up and
[0:50] Scattered in different parts of the
[0:51] world and some you take an animal you
[0:55] take any life that eats off of a certain
[0:57] sorrow it'll turn that color
[1:00] uh if he's a hunter here you just follow
[1:02] me a few minutes go down into Mexico and
[1:05] get to Kyle take up here in Arizona and
[1:07] get to Coyote go up in the north and get
[1:09] the same coyote watch the three colors
[1:12] get a hila monster that's raised in
[1:13] Texas and get one that's raised in
[1:15] Arizona look at the differ in see
[1:17] because it's a sorrow they live on see
[1:19] and now the Chinese the Chinese is a a
[1:22] yellow person Japanese and so forth and
[1:25] a Chinese the Ethiopian is a is the
[1:28] colored man of the Negro we have now and
[1:31] he went down to those dark countries
[1:33] down there and they and and they were
[1:36] and then the white man was the
[1:38] anglosaxon people which we are and of
[1:42] the the people here what we call the
[1:43] white people they come from England
[1:46] which was formerly called Angeline and
[1:49] because they were white and blonde and
[1:51] so forth they scattered up in the
[1:52] Ireland and Norway and so forth up in
[1:55] there and all come out of the Anglo
[1:56] Saxon people now which was first and
[1:59] which was was
[2:00] cursed there was none of them I know
[2:04] where you're trying to get to you're
[2:05] trying to get the ham I know where
[2:07] you're going the Ham's people now there
[2:11] was ham sham and Jeff now ham he he did
[2:16] not try to hide his father's nakedness
[2:19] but laugh and made fun of him and God
[2:21] put a curse on H for looking to his
[2:24] father's nakedness and not trying to
[2:27] cover up his shame and Sham and Jeff
[2:30] back up and thre their coats over their
[2:32] father when he was laying naked and now
[2:34] God told ham that his generation would
[2:38] serve the others now if you thought that
[2:41] was a curse of turning of dark well then
[2:45] the Jews dark
[2:46] also if you think that would be the the
[2:49] what we call the colored man or the
[2:50] Negro of this country at Che now you are
[2:54] to go over to India the Indians are way
[2:56] darker than the
[2:57] Negro I've been in both their countries
[2:59] Here's the the Ethiopian down there from
[3:02] Ethiopia and the African the colored man
[3:04] that we know today they're down there
[3:06] many of them still in the Primitive in
[3:08] their tribes just about like we was when
[3:10] Jesus comes the white people were just
[3:13] as primitive as the the native of Africa
[3:15] is now worse perhaps remember 2,000
[3:19] years ago we were naked tribes man out
[3:22] with a with a boy and a on a stone ax of
[3:24] hunting that's exactly right we Anglo
[3:27] Saxon
[3:28] people that's act right so which was
[3:31] which I'll tell you the one today is
[3:33] cursed is the one that refuses Jesus
[3:36] Christ that's all the one that accepts
[3:38] Jesus Christ is blessed now you can't
[3:41] say I'll go get the Eskimo out of that
[3:43] land up Y and there he is up there and
[3:47] that man is darker than the colored
[3:49] people that we had here I'll go over to
[3:51] India and get the Indians and he is he's
[3:54] not a colored man he's really black he's
[3:57] blacker than this real black black color
[4:00] and he's what is called and he's an
[4:03] Indian well now in Africa we get some of
[4:06] the African people that are some of them
[4:09] are light color some of them are almost
[4:11] like white and some are are different
[4:13] ways you go the Jew you say all the Jews
[4:16] are are dark complexed the Jew is a
[4:18] brown person but I've seen a man one
[4:20] redheaded with blue eyes fair skin see
[4:24] so the whole thing is this we all come
[4:26] off of One
[4:27] Tree that's right and we was all cursed
[4:30] through the fall of Eden and we're all
[4:33] saved through the resurrection of Jesus
[4:36] Christ there it is so there's no curse
[4:39] the cursed is them that does not believe
[4:41] the blessed are those that do believe so
[4:44] there is neither one friend the black or
[4:46] the colored man or the white man or the
[4:48] yellow man then if the black man was
[4:50] cursed by being black then the yellow
[4:52] man is just halfway
[4:54] curse and then the and then the yellow
[4:56] man and then the brown man he's just
[4:58] two3 of the way
[5:00] cursed see and then the Africans about
[5:03] four fths cursed and I guess the Indian
[5:06] is really the cursed thing oh my how
[5:09] nonsense no it's a different climate and
[5:12] the things that the people lived in they
[5:13] turned tribes off and so forth there
[5:16] different look at the American
[5:18] Indians many of those the Navajo out
[5:21] there is a darker race of people than
[5:23] our colored Ethiopian people in this
[5:25] country the naol the PES or the kind of
[5:30] a copper
[5:31] color and the different tribes see so
[5:34] you out there amongst the Indians right
[5:36] here you find the black ones and almost
[5:38] and the Cherokee is almost as pale as we
[5:41] are the Cherokee and there right here in
[5:44] this nation the different trib so you
[5:46] see you can't say they're half cursed
[5:48] and always cursed there wasn't cursed
[5:50] because they're black it wasn't cursed
[5:52] because they were yellow or because they
[5:53] were white there's only one curse that I
[5:56] know of and that's unbelief of Jesus
[5:58] Christ but in the days of the voice of
[6:01] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[6:03] sound the mystery of God should be
[6:05] finished as he hath declared to his
[6:08] servants the prophets
