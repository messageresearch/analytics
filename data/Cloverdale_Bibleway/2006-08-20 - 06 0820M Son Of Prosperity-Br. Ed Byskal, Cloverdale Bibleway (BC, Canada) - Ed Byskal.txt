But brother Ernie, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. Got a number of requests here this morning we want to take before the throne of grace. There's an unspoken uh prayer request for Clifford and Angie Brown. Um there's a request um that we pray for brother Lloyd Siller suffering from uh cancer. He went to Manitoba to visit uh his granddaughter but wasn't able to make it home as he became quite ill out there. His confession is that it's no more than a toothache to the Lord. We want to remember brother Lloyd this morning and uh faithful brother want to remember our sister uh Christa Bondi this morning. She says she wants to thank each and every one of you that has remembered me in your prayers. She's on chemotherapy and is praying that the Lord uh would give see me through this. Also, uh our brother John Drake is requesting prayer this morning. He's at home sick, not well in his body. Brother Mike Causalino is requesting prayer uh continued prayer for his son Tony who's still being detained in Japan that God would use this situation for his glory. And uh we want to remember the Cobb family down in Oregon. Our brother Richard uh Cobb went to be with the Lord this past week. And so we want to remember the family in the church down there as well. Amen. If you've got a need this morning, if you're listening in on the internet and you've got a need, just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. [Music] Father, we come before your throne of grace this morning, thankful for this revelation of grace that you have given to us, Lord, that there are a people on the earth that have been called, chosen, predestinated before the foundation of the world to live an overcoming life to be able to shine as as lights in a in a darkened world, oh God, to show that Jesus Christ is alive. The word has been resurrected and is living in his bride. Lord, we thank you that we are a part of that. And by faith, Lord God, we want to know and we want to be that that that perfect person. We want to rise up, oh God, into that stature that your your prophet of God has has laid out for us, Father, for the many prayer requests that we have heard this morning. Lord, for passing of our precious brother Richard Cobb, Lord, I pray that you would bless their family, oh God. Pray that you'd bring comfort to them.

Father would be their portion Lord that it would be a a celebration of a homegoing of a faithful servant of God. Oh God Lord for brother Mike Cosalino. Lord we just continue to pray for his son brother Tony. Oh God we just pray that you would work out all the details. I pray that you would give him favor with those that he has to deal with. Oh God, Lord, just move by your supernatural hand and let it be a message. Let it be a message to them, oh God, that that that you are still moving in his heart and that a token has been placed over him by a faithful father. Oh God, Lord for for brother John Drake.

We want to greet everyone this morning and uh want to bring greetings as well.

Please do not bring any more clothing for the Ukraine or the Philippines until further notice. I guess they got to get it all packed up and shipped out. Uh, and also uh if you have forgetful children uh which probably includes most of the children uh that went to camp, please check the lost and found. Even if you don't know anything's missing, you'd be surprised, uh, something is there that you won't find missing for a while. So, um, check the lost and found, uh, because, uh, I know once it once it gets too long, then they stuff goes ends up going to the Philippines or the Ukraine. Amen. We've got a special this morning. Uh, Brother Matt Ardel and group are going to come and sing. And, uh, while they're coming, let's sing He is here. Hallelujah. He is here. Amen. He is here. [Music] He is here. [Music] He is here. Holy, holy, I will bless his holy [Music] Hear him calling out your name. He is here. Oh, you can't touch it. You will never be the same. [Music] [Music] Jo. Joseph lived a life of hurt and hatred. And even his own family brought him pain. [Music] And when his brothers thought that he would surely seek revenge, he said, "I have seen God's purpose now made plain." [Music] It was the tender hand. of Jehovah. [Music] I look back and see he was always leading me. And what was meant for me? Oh, God has used to show me his great love. I now understand the tender hand of Jehovah. Many Jews were killed and saw a sunburn. Oh, and it seemed that God had left his very own. And through it all, God had a plan, little did they know, oh that he would lead all of his children back home. [Music] So how can I deny his hand of mercy? Oh, and trles they came and they left. No reason why. &gt;&gt; No reason why. I just stand and say that everything has worked out for my good. Oh, he has all he has all the answers for my life. It was the tater hand. [Music] Lord Jehovah. I look back and see he was always leading me. And what was made for him used to show me his great love. I now understand the tender hand of Jehovah and what was made for me [Music] to show me his great love. I now understand. I now understand. I now understand the name of Jehovah. Jehovah. [Applause] tender hand. Oh, [Music] each and every one of can look back and see the hand of God on your life. Amen. And we want him to come and touch us this morning. I feel the pull. I hear the call as brother Biscll comes with the word. I feel the fall. [Music] I hear the fall. And his spirit is moving me to give my all. He's speaking to me. and I glory. I feel. [Music] Oh, I feel [Music] I hear and is moving me to give my heart to me and I [Music] take control. I feel the Lord. Feel my God. Oh, I [Music] come [Music] Oh my god. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Here is my me. [Music] Amen. Well, we have some fill our cup and I believe we need to expect it. say, "I I've come with an empty cup and now I want to have it filled up. I believe our Lord is here to do that for us." Brother Ernie, I appreciated the prayer. I listen to what the brothers pray. And I feel that the Holy Spirit is present and that he has a thought. He has a mind. He has a direction. And we want that direction. I believe we've had that direction before camp, during camp, and now we're in post camp time. Nothing hinges on camp, but it is a time. It's a special time when we set ourselves aside. And to me, that's really special. &gt;&gt; Just set ourselves aside and shut the door on so many of our activities or all the activities that we possibly can. And uh parents are away from, you know, the dayto-day grind. Children don't have school. They're not thinking about their studies. And it's really nice to shut out the world, isn't it? as much as possible. Wish we could do it more more often. So, I appreciate that prayer and certainly appreciate the song that was sung, the tender hand of Jehovah. We certainly need that. And uh there's a family we want to be remembering today uh that really need the tender hand of Jehovah, and it's the Cobb family. Pastor Richard Cobb passed away yesterday morning and it was rather sudden. I had gotten a a note an email during camp, excuse me, that brother Cobb was not well, but uh he had been he had had spells of illness over the last years. And so I didn't take it to be real real serious. and then just yesterday morning have re received news that he had passed away. So we want to be remembering our sister Cobb uh and Richard his son who's taking uh good part of the responsibility there at the church in Salem, Oregon. Also brother Jeff Jenkins wife, Sister Debbie, that's her daddy. And so I spoke with brother Jeff as soon as I had heard and uh there is no service that has been announced. Uh I believe they're going to have a maybe some private time with the family at graveside and then perhaps a memorial service later but we don't have any date so we I can't give you any time. But the one thing that we can do, we can remember the Cobb family and uh and the church. When a pastor is taken like that, you can imagine how the church feels. And so it has a far-reaching effect and we want to remember them. It's been quite a few years since brother Cobb was up here, even though we did try to have him come up at different times and it just didn't work out. Um, so we want to remember them. Uh, I'll have you stand and before we read the scripture, I would like to sing, brother Ryan, more of you because I don't know, I can't speak for you, but I can speak for myself. I want to have more of him when I leave this service than when I came to church this morning. And if I have a if we have a united uh spirit of feeling of that, then the service will take its proper course. And do you desire that more of him? We're not satisfied with what we have. We just want more of him. Let's just join our hearts together as we sing that please. [Music] I might you all my but I still Empty and Lord hear my prayer [Music] prayerfully now. Oh God, we can do his lovely power. Pour out your spirit. All I need is for you. All things I do. Yeah. [Music] I pray for you. &gt;&gt; Empty and bare. Lord, hear my prayer for all. Once again, so empty and rare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of you. With our heads bowed, heavenly father, we are not coming offering anything of ourselves, for we have nothing to offer. All we are and all we ever can be is what you have given already. All things have come from the father of lights, the giver of every good gift. And Lord, even our fellowship here this morning is a gift that has come from you. the redemption that we have experienced, the deliverance from condemnation and our sins to know that they are annihilated in the sea of your forgetfulness. Oh, what a joy, what a gift, oh God. Everything has come from you. And the fact we have the strength to even open our lips and open our mouths and to proclaim your praise is something that's a gift from you. And so we offer you what you've given us and we offer it back to you. Oh God, receive our thanksgiving, the service, Lord, the worship, the songs, and now the prayer and the ministry of your word. Father, we're asking especially you'll be with the Cobb family. Oh God, our sister Cobb, uh, Brother Richard, his wife, Charity, Lord, and sister Debbie, and her husband, Brother Jeff Jenkins. Pray, Father, in a special way you'll be in attendance near them. For you are the comforter, oh God. You're that special friend in time of need. And Lord, if we were in that need, we would appreciate praying for people praying for us. And so, as a congregation, we're praying for them. As an individual, I am praying for them. And all of these people, Lord, are something of prayer is being whispered in their hearts. God touch their lives. And I pray that you will help the assembly, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. Praying also, Lord, for brothers, sisters Drews Barry and their church having the loss of their church by fire. Pray, oh God, that there'll be a holy fire in the very in the hearts of the people. And we see already a great strength is there, Lord. We do not know who or what is responsible for this tragedy, but you will be glorified in it all. You have never never lost a battle. And so we're so grateful this morning, Lord. We serve the mighty conqueror. We thank you, Lord, for each person that is here and pray that you'll be with us now that we might receive what we should receive. I pray you'll touch me, Lord, and anoint me, anoint the people to hear. And may the inspiration of your word continue, Lord, in the hearts of the people. Reveal to us what needs to be known in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Nice to see our brother Hines Lancov. God bless you. Our brother Brian and Sister Jenny Jones are in their last service with us right now. And and uh oh, how we've enjoyed them. They've been staying with us in our home and we just uh love to have them. They're just uh just that I I trust they've been at home. We felt at home with them. And how many would like to see our brother Brian come back someday? Sister Janney. Amen. Someone said, "If the Lord's willing," and uh and the preacher said, "He's willing. He's willing." He he knew what the will mind of the Lord was. At least that's what he was declaring. You can open your Bibles please to Genesis the 39th chapter. And uh my the uh the presentation at the camp was something so wonderful and the meetings our brother Ron Spencer preached on Joseph were so uh so inspiring and so fitting. And I announced there at the last service of the camp that I felt I would speak on on Joseph as well. Uh I want to speak on Joseph as the son of prosperity. And that will be uh my subject this morning. I'm going to read from the 39th chapter starting with verse one down through verse 6 and then verse 23. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt. And Piper, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the IshRaelites, which had brought him down thither. And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man, and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found grace in his sight. And he served him, and made him overseer over his house. And all that he had, he put into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseayer in his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake. And the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field. And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand. and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person and well favored. From the time of this verse, Piper's beautiful wife attempts to seduce Joseph. Joseph resists her her approach. He is falsely accused. He's cast into prison. in prison. He's blessed and uh he's put in charge and then the dream of the baker and the butler and the release of the butler and then recalling the dream of Joseph. And the Bible says in verse 23, "The keeper of the prison looked not on anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper." Amen. &gt;&gt; Son of prosperity, you may be seated. I need to establish two things right at the beginning of the service this morning. And I I trust that your minds will capture and retain this thought throughout the service. First the the term prosper in the Hebrew and in reference to uh Joseph, it does not have the same uh the same reference as we have in our daily language today to prosper materially. That would be more to to have wealth or riches. But to prosper in the Hebrew here the first meaning is to rush or it is to advance or make progress. He was prosperous. He advanced. He made progress. And also to succeed. It also means to be profitable. But it is to bring to successful issue. It is to show the demonstration or the manifestation to show experience and to show prosperity. This is what the uh the Hebrew word in fact is the first occurrence of this word prosperity or to prosper or prosperous in the Bible is when it it speaks of Ezer will prosper. He said God has prospered my journey. He's prospered my way. And and what he's making reference to is I am achieving my goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have advanced. I have moved forward. I have followed the word that has been given me. I have followed the instruction. I've been told by my master, go and get a bride. And I prayed a certain prayer that the woman that would offer drink to my camels would be the woman. and God has prospered my way. I have achieved the goal. &gt;&gt; And that's what the word prosper really has reference to. That's its first meaning in the Hebrew. And that's what we want to stay with. That's what we want to put at least our emphasis on. And the second thing that I really need even more than and than what I just made reference to is that Joseph is a perfect type of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and Jesus Christ is the word. And so when I make references to Joseph, when I make references to him, I would like you to be able to tie it immediately to the word. &gt;&gt; Joseph prospered. The word prospered. Joseph reached his goals. He achieved certain goals. The word will achieve its goal where unto it has been sent according to Isaiah in the 55th chapter and we'll read that verse a little later on. So, Joseph is a perfect type of Jesus Christ. These references that we will look on today from at in Joseph's life and the characteristics of his life, we can take and turn it right around and bring it to this day and apply it right to the message. &gt;&gt; Absolute make the same application. Now, this is just personally I I thought I was blessed by it. The Bible says that God loved that Israel loved Joseph more than all of his children because he was the son of his old age. And I was thinking in terms of Luke 17:30, the revelation of the son of man, the revelation of Jesus Christ in the end time, in the latter times, in the time of his old age. Now, God doesn't get old, but this is in the latter time that God has assigned to mankind upon the earth. And in the latter time, it seems that there is a like a a greater demonstration of the love of God to us who have come out of Leodysia who have been delivered out of the depths of the iniquity of this generation. It seems to me that's a greater demonstration of God's love. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are going to view this part of Joseph's life through the prism of Luke 17:30. In the day when the son of man in the days of Noah, in the days of Sodom, even in that day will the son of man be revealed. And that son of man, that son has been revealed. He's the son. And that son is none other than the word of God made manifest, vindicated, confirmed. And God has loved this son because it's coming to its fulfillment. And I I trust you'll be able to with me be with me. I've said here, and I just want to follow these notes quite carefully because I've pondered them very very deeply over these last days. Joseph, the perfect type of Jesus Christ. He and he is the word and that word is living in his bride body. &gt;&gt; Then some of those characteristics of the life of Joseph has direct reference to us. We could say Joseph perfect type of Jesus Christ. Amen. Fine. And Jesus Christ is the word. Say amen. That's great. Hallelujah. And that word uh that word is the message of the hour. It's the revealed word of the day. We say amen. Amen. Now we want to say and that word lives in me. &gt;&gt; That word lives now. It is a living word. I have received it in a heart of faith. I have received it in spite of any opposition. I've received it and it now lives in me. Then that means the characteristics and the description, the relationship of God to Joseph has a direct reference to the same God that's dwelling in you by virtue of how he transferred himself &gt;&gt; into you by making it a spoken word, a confirmed word, a vindicated word. And you believed it &gt;&gt; in spite of all obstacles. You believed it. You received it. Then then God's relationship to Joseph as a man and and how he dealt with him has direct relationship to you as an individual. &gt;&gt; Have I made the connection? &gt;&gt; It's essential that we see that Joseph had to prosper because he's a perfect type of Jesus Christ. Because he's a perfect type of the word. He had to prosper. Amen. &gt;&gt; The living word in its season will prosper. &gt;&gt; It has to prosper. &gt;&gt; It has to achieve its goal. &gt;&gt; It cannot fail. &gt;&gt; How can God fail? How can this word fail? If it's word in you, how can you fail? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I guess the question is to how do we judge prosperity? How would you judge prosperity? Prosperity and riches in the Bible, as I said a moment ago, are two quite different things. The Leodysian church said, "I'm rich and increased with goods." And brother Brandham's very quick to point out that was her own self-estimation of what she was. That wasn't God's estimation. That was her own self estimation of what she was. That she was rich and increased with goods. But this is not prosperity because prosperity is reaching the goal. And the Leodysian age was not reaching their goal. They were not achieving God's plan for them. For even Christ was outside of the church knocking trying to get in. And in the Leodysian church age, in the church age book, brother Brandham says, "The Leodysian church is saying, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing." That was her, that was her self-estimate. She looked at herself and that was what she saw. She said, "I'm rich." Which means she's wealthy in the things of the world. But she was not prosperous. She was not prosperous. It is virtually impossible to live by every word of God and fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's impossible to live by every word of God and fail. I'll put it another way. It's impossible to live by every word of God and not be prosperous &gt;&gt; in the sense of making progress and succeeding. Isaiah, God speaking through Isaiah says this, "So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth." Now, when you go home this afternoon, I suggest you read Isaiah 55, the the chapter, the the whole chapter. It's not a long chapter, but and if you would please note when you're reading the verses that precede the 11th verse because you're going to find it starts out, whole everyone that thirsteth. There are certain conditions as you move along in the chapter you'll find uh the the word of God through Isaiah is identifying oh alas anyone that thirsteth let him come to the waters and he that hath no money goes on to describe it and wherefore do you spend money for bread that and and labor for that which doesn't satisfy and then the third verse says incline your ear so He that thirsteth, incline your ear. And you'll find those phrases on through. And then when you get to the 11th verse, it says this. Maybe I'll read the 10th verse also. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and re and returnneeth not, but waterth the earth, and maketh it bring forth the bud, that it might give seed to the sewer, and bread to the eater. The rain comes down and it doesn't return. It comes down to the earth and maketh maketh it to bud. The seed to bud. It says, "So shall my word be." God is likening it now. So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth like rain that falls from heaven. &gt;&gt; It doesn't return back in the form of rain. &gt;&gt; But it brings forth something else. It produces a lifegiving seed. It produces conditions for life. So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return void, &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish. It shall accomplish that which I please, that which I have pleasure in, and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sent it. it shall achieve its purpose and its goal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now friends, if that word dwells in us richly and we give it full, we yield to it. That's why it's so important. We yield to it under its mighty uh power and persuasion of the Holy Spirit. We yield to it. We just dwell in that and the very atmosphere of it. You will succeed. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will reach your goal. &gt;&gt; You will achieve your fulfillment and you will do God's purpose. &gt;&gt; It's impossible to do any otherwise. &gt;&gt; It says the word that goeth forth out of my mouth and this going forth is to proceed towards something to go forth with a purpose and for a result. it. This word that goeth forth out of his mouth is to cause, to cause, to bring out or to lead out or to deliver. And it is also to accomplish or to fashion, to make or produce. The word of God shall produce what has been sent to produce. Hallelujah. And I want to look upon a congregation as I do this morning. And I I say in my heart, man has not produced this. &gt;&gt; Man cannot do this. &gt;&gt; Man has not sent this message around the globe. &gt;&gt; Man has not directed this to the hearts of individuals. Hither and yawn. Who are we? We are total strangers in the world. Our what our paths had ever crossed. It was the prosperity of the word of God that has caused even you and I and the person sitting next to you to even know one another as brothers and sisters in Christ. You would have been hither and yawn. You would have been someplace else in the world. Some of you would have been gone and under the earth already. But God in his mercy &gt;&gt; has united the body of Christ together &gt;&gt; and causes one member to be with another member so that we can be uh uh benefited by that which every joint supply. &gt;&gt; I'm a firm believer in the friends and God give me strength this morning. I have a I have a halo &gt;&gt; I want to drop on you. &gt;&gt; It's going to achieve it. It's already commissioned to achieve it. &gt;&gt; It's impossible for it to fail. It's not you that's prosperous. It's the word that's prosperous. &gt;&gt; You aren't going to reach your goal on your own steam and energy. And those that deprive themselves of the word, they deprive themselves. They simply make their journey harder and longer and become weary and unhappy and are do not achieve their goal in full fully in life like they could have &gt;&gt; if they allowed the word of God first place in their life. &gt;&gt; That's why I don't believe we should go along like hitchhikers. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't go along and uh try to get by on easy street in the message. Say I'm baptized into this word. I'm baptized into this thing. Hallelujah. I'm swallowed up in it. I'm consumed by it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where's something I can do for God? Just show me the way. Point me in that direction. I want to use my life. I want to use my energy for the kingdom of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. Now, I want to take several subjects, several parts. I want to speak on Joseph in respect to prosperity and advancement. Advancement as the favored of the father. Prosperity as a child favored of the father. The favored child is not often the one that really does well in the world. In the worldly sense, you find the favored child highly favored generally ends up highly spoiled. And some young men and women that I know, even in this city of Vancouver, that really were born with a golden spoon, not silver, but golden spoon in their hand and delivered to them on a golden platter and had all the wealth and the opportunity and every any school was open to them anywhere in the world or college, university or whatever more. They had they had it all. But they ended up as drug addicts, ended up as hopeless cases and were ashamed to to the community. That's what they ended up as. &gt;&gt; That's not so with the favored child. Joseph was a favored child. And the scripture says Israel loved Joseph more than all his children. God loved Joseph more than all of his children. One of the things that I encounter when people first come to the knowledge of the Christ in the light of this message because a lot of people come to altars and and receive Christ and various uh uh you know churches and whatever more but one of the strong elements of this message is election &gt;&gt; predestination and that's what I caught in brother Ernie's prayer as he began his prayer. called, elected, &gt;&gt; predestinated. He said, and I said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; And one of the things, and some people have a long time getting over it, say, "Why me? Why not somebody else? What about all these good people? What about the rest of my family? Why me? I don't feel worthy of it." But you never find Joseph saying that. &gt;&gt; You never find Jesus saying that. &gt;&gt; Why me? &gt;&gt; Why wasn't somebody else? That's something that's not to be part of our vocabulary. &gt;&gt; We leave it up to God. Knowing brethren, beloved, your election of God, your choosing that God, he's the one who made the choice. Peter said, "Elect according to the fornowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit under obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Grace unto you and peace be multiplied." John said, "And we know, we know that we are of God." I have read those years ago and I thought how can John be so confident and speak uh and so isolate as it was the handful of people we know we are of God &gt;&gt; and the whole world lith in wickedness. That's powerful statement even today. &gt;&gt; But we need to be able to make that same statement. &gt;&gt; We know we are of God. What about the others? That's up to God. But we know we are of God &gt;&gt; and the whole world lith in wickedness. &gt;&gt; It's not easy, especially for us in this Leodysian age to assign the world into a uh to assign him as being laying in wickedness. But that's what the scripture says. Listen friends, you know this isn't there are aspects of the word of God that are seem to be so confining. There's aspects of the word of God that seem to be harsh because they're not in the emotional realm. There are aspects of the message which are very very strong statements. One of them being that which is out there is just so much atomic &gt;&gt; fodder because we see the living and we see people for you know what they are in life and so on. But go and stand at the at the cemetery. Go and stand at a cemetery and see all of those tombstones and and and all the flowers and everything. And everybody has some loved one and they're remembering that and they're putting flowers and they go back there every once in a while. But when you stand there, it's a and I have done it. I've passed by. I said, I wondered how many of those people died loving God with all their heart and soul and living for the word of God and wanting to be every bit of follower and disciple of Jesus Christ. Not very many. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you say. Not very many. &gt;&gt; And so if you just trans transfer that percentage to the living percentage, you got about the same thing. and few there be &gt;&gt; that enter in &gt;&gt; few there be &gt;&gt; we're here as quite a number this morning and I hope we all reach the other side &gt;&gt; but I can tell you one thing you need to re be resolved in your heart that you're going to live by every word of God this present word that's been revealed you need to resolve God has no favorites. &gt;&gt; God is no respector of persons. God does not say whoever joins that church or Cloverdale Bible way, they have some special place. No, that's not so. It's not sufficient to walk into this church or any other church. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that will bring you sufficiency in Christ, and that is that you have had an encounter with Jesus Christ, the word. Not Jesus Christ some figment of your imagination. &gt;&gt; People today are absorbed and know I love Jesus. Which Jesus? Who is Jesus? Jesus is this word in all of its capacity, in all of its beauty &gt;&gt; and even when it's harsh. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "He that doesn't take up his cross and follow follow me cannot be my disciple." Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; Who is me? Who is he? He's the word. &gt;&gt; He's the living word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we know that the son of God is come, John said, and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is truth. These verses are so potent, so powerful, pregnant with life. And we know that the son of god has come. Who in the world can realize that the son of god has come as he has come in his word coming? And the prophet says his word coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many know? &gt;&gt; How many how many have had that kind of an understanding? And that is what we have an un what does that mean to a person? Is it just uh uh an expansion of our knowledge? Is it just some kind of catechism? Is it just something that we teach at the church? What is it? Or is it an experience? I met him. &gt;&gt; I had an encounter with him. &gt;&gt; I walk with him on a dayto-day basis. He speaks to me &gt;&gt; and I understand him and I speak to him and he understands me. I ask and he gives. &gt;&gt; I ask and he says no &gt;&gt; and it's still God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that the kind of God we have? &gt;&gt; Not some not some figment of imagination. Not something that's been projected from history till now. We know about the cross. We know about the resurrection. We understand that. We believe that. But all of that, all of that becomes meaningless if we fail to recognize him now here in this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One that has been raised from history through a prophet's ministry. One that's been raised from the tomb. And he said, "My ministry is to prove he's resurrected. &gt;&gt; He's not dead. &gt;&gt; He's not a history. &gt;&gt; He's not some cold tradition. He's a living God now. and that he is deity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the mysteries are revealed. &gt;&gt; We're not floundering around wondering about the godhead or the baptism or about the original sin. &gt;&gt; Thank God &gt;&gt; those things have been made clear. &gt;&gt; Thank God that the seals have been opened, &gt;&gt; those mysteries have been revealed. And we know that the son of God has come and hath given us an understanding. That's why he came to give us an understanding that we may know him. That is true. That's the reason for the understanding. That we may know him and that we are in him. &gt;&gt; That is true. Even in his son Jesus Christ that is the true God and eternal life. In the message, the war great warrior David, brother Bram said, David was called by election. And I just like this so we can make it a personal reference. He was elected, called, anointed, and placed. Elected by God, called from sheep hurting to be king. Anointed and positionally placed. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Abraham, election, Isaac, justification, Jacob, grace, and Joseph, perfection. That's the foundation of the masterpiece. He said, "How many Christians here raise up your hand? You're not a Christian by your desire. You're a Christian by God's desire." Oh, I hungered after God. Wonderful. But God hungered after you more than you hungered after him. You're not a Christian by your desire. You're a Christian by his desire. It's election. &gt;&gt; And then he poured his oil upon you. Said he poured his oil upon David. Just went all over him. A horn, a whole horn of full of it. Not sparingly. And that's the way God pours the Holy Ghost on a man. &gt;&gt; Not sparingly, just baptizes him into it. &gt;&gt; Anointing him with the spirit. He said, "Right then, when that anointing," listen to this closely now. When that anointing struck him or struck you, you are positionally placed as David was positionally placed as a king. You are pos placed positionally in Christ Jesus as kings and priests. And the moment you receive the Holy Spirit, God places you in the kingdom and air. What a beautiful picture. And there you are. I say there you are this morning. That's where you are. Joseph was given a coat of many colors. I love very much how brother Brandham interprets that Joseph the younger son he said rejected of his brethren Christ rejected of his brethren he wore a coat of seven colors Joseph and the seven colors of course represented seven colors of the rainbow which was a covenant Joseph perfect type of Christ completely covered with the covenant of God. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. And no wonder in Revelation chapter 10, he saw one sitting upon the throne and over his head was a rainbow. And another mighty angel came down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head. Why? Because he's the covenant angel. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the covenant angel. &gt;&gt; Joseph was covered with a covenant. &gt;&gt; He was the covenant child. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the covenant son &gt;&gt; and we are his covenant bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're robed in his righteousness. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the robe that robes you is much more wonderful than the cloth that robed Joseph, &gt;&gt; Jacob's son, &gt;&gt; the robe that you have this morning is much more beautiful than that robe. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; God always has his covenant people. And then this young Joseph was killed supposedingly by his brethren and his coat was to be returned to his father. Oh my. Oh my. How the Lord Jesus Christ after his death and his resurrection with that covenant blood ascended up. The Bible says into the holiest of all in the presence of God says it's finished. Father it's done. Hallelujah. The price has been paid. Your your covenant has been kept. &gt;&gt; I don't know how you're feeling, but I'm feeling religious when I get to that. &gt;&gt; He says, "I want you to see another thing. He was thrown into a ditch and was supposedly to be dead, but was taken up from the ditch and was taken into the greatest commercial city of the world and was made a right-hand man. Not no man could enter into the gates or come into the courts without first coming through Joseph a perfect type of Christ. in the message Israel in Egypt. He said while he was in prison there were two men a butler and a baker and one of them was lost and the other one was saved. Never forget when brother Brandham said to me a lot of people think that three died at Calvary said there was four. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the son of God and he took one to heaven and Judas the son of predition and he took one to hell. was four that went at the time of Calvary. And Judas was the son of predition. And while Joseph was in his prison, one was delivered and restored back to his original place and the other one uh was destroyed. Joseph of perfect type. Israel and Egypt message. Joseph a perfect type. I just want to get these few quotes here. And this is the last one just now. He says, "Standing there like the Jews returning in the last days and how we our newscasts are filled with what is happening in Israel right now. Joseph a perfect type standing there like the Jews returning in the last days at the end coming to the millennium when the Jews will be saved again." And Joseph, you know how he was sent down there, how how the Israel sent down his children. That's Jacob. And they got a little corn. They were starving to death. And Joseph had interpreted the king's dream and how he had put up the corn &gt;&gt; and the only place in the world that had food. Now, if you will keep the initial thought from the beginning when we speak of Joseph, we come right through Christ through the revealing of Jesus Christ in the end time and that he came not only to heal the sick and all those things, but he came and poured himself into a word so that a people of that season could believe that word and the word could continue its course and be poured into the people so the word could become flesh once gain &gt;&gt; and the scripture says the brother Brandham drawing from the scriptures is that was the only place there was corn. &gt;&gt; It's not the only place there may be entertainment or the only place there may be church or the only place there may be religion but it's the only place there's corn. &gt;&gt; They might have had dancing. They might have had whatever they had in the rest of Egypt, but there was and the rest of the nations, but there was only one place there was corn. He said the only place in the world that they had food perfect of the church today, the only place spiritual food is given out is in the kingdom of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You can have all kinds of psychology. You can have all kinds of messages of every kind. You can have positive teaching. You can have faithbuilding sermons. You can have all kinds of things. You can be moved. You can be anointed. But I'm not interested merely in an anointing. I'm interested in the truth &gt;&gt; of God's word. &gt;&gt; You can go to some old church creed and recite a few apostles creeds and whatever you want to. But brother, the spirit lays in the bornagain church of the living God is the only where there's food. And those Jews are going to recognize that one of these days and they're coming. This was way back when he was preaching these messages. And the Jews and here they are. And we've come all of these years. Friends, I I keep watching Israel, God's time piece. I keep watching it very very carefully, but I cannot interpret everything that is happening. And I see Jew fighting with Jew and Jew, hauling Jew off of his own land and see all these kind of things taking place. May not be able to interpret everything, but I can I can see more clearly the distinction between those that are of the 144,000 faith of the 144,000. There is an elect group in Israel that are believing God's word. They're not interested in politics. They're not interested in compromise. They're not interested in in any other solution. They want God's solution. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say, the word that goeth forth out of his mouth shall not return unto him void, &gt;&gt; but it shall accomplish that for which it has been sent. &gt;&gt; And it will please God when he sees the fulfillment of it. &gt;&gt; You know friends, don't get taken up. Please don't become affected and afflicted with the mentality of this generation. &gt;&gt; Don't get afflicted with the mentality of Leodya that you know somehow everything's going to work out. Everybody's okay. Everybody has their own rights to their own opinion. Da da da da da da. This is the only opinion &gt;&gt; and this is the only word that's going to be fulfilled. And do you know that when God's purpose is is is finally fulfilled upon Israel, do you know a lot of people are going to perish? &gt;&gt; Do you know that a lot of nice people are going to perish? &gt;&gt; Do you know that a lot of babies are going to perish &gt;&gt; and already have &gt;&gt; and that we do not we do not feel good about that? &gt;&gt; I don't feel good about innocent people suffering. &gt;&gt; But it happens. &gt;&gt; It does happen and it will happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And before God's word is fulfilled, there's going to be a lot more &gt;&gt; in the end. Let me tell you friends, don't listen to all this preaching and be caught in the tribulation. I will say to you that come to Bible way, whatever you do, don't be caught in a time of tribulation. I don't believe you need to. &gt;&gt; I don't believe you need to sit here and say, "Well, am I predestinated to it or am I not?" This world is headed for a horrible destruction. &gt;&gt; And that also is in the word of God. And this word of God shall prosper. It shall prosper. It shall accomplish what it's been sent to do. And he says this in closing with this part. And those Jews are going to recognize that one of these days and they're coming. That's why they're there. They're going to recognize it one of these days. Now, the grace of God is upon this message. &gt;&gt; The grace of God is upon this word. &gt;&gt; The child grew and waxed strong. It says of Jesus, he waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. the grace, the favor, unmmerited favor, the loving kindness. And he loved Jacob. He loved Jacob loved Joseph more than all the children. There's a special favor upon this message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's a special favor upon it. Now, some of you and the young people you've been born and raised in it, you might not have anything to relate to, but I hope that before the service is over, you'll be able to have a better a better understanding of it. Brother Brandham says, and it's absolutely true, giving all the glory to the Lord Jesus, he said he did he's done more in Jeffersonville than he done in did in in his own ministry &gt;&gt; in Palestine. &gt;&gt; What What do I call that? I call that more favor. &gt;&gt; More favored in the end time. And I'll tell you why Jesus did what he did. And he even said to his disciples, "Don't go to the Gentiles. Just go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." Because they were the ones that were going to be judged. And it was Jerusalem that suffered incredible suffering when Titus came and destroyed it. And Israel has suffered. The Jew has suffered enormous, enormous tragedies, just horrific things over the centuries because they rejected Christ. &gt;&gt; And that is the one thing that the Roman Catholic Church and the Jewish people today try to settle on that because one blames the other and the other blame the other. And finally at the at the end time and it's so Leodysian. It's so modern to be able to say, "Well, let's let's bury the hatchet. We won't blame you any longer and you don't blame us." And that's really what they've come to. &gt;&gt; That's been the big dividing point between what so-called Christianity and Judaism. You blamed us for the death of Jesus Christ and and we and and we say it's your fault. You people did it. And so now we'll bury the hatchet. And somehow that seems to be, you know, very civilized. That's very appropriate. And suddenly nobody's responsible for it. It's just something that happened. No, I believe that the message has been highly highly favored of God. To have the grace of God is to be the recipient. This is my language, my terms now. To be the recipient of merciful kindness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Undeserving. &gt;&gt; No one can say I'm deserving. Undeserving. &gt;&gt; Though we were, yet we have been the recipient by election, &gt;&gt; by choosing. of merciful kindness upon our lives. The Bible says also in John 1:14, "And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth." The only only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. Now I know if I say, "How many believe that that was Jesus Christ?" You say, "Yeah, amen. I believe it." But now if that was only of Jesus Christ back 2,000 years ago, then somehow God's uh the continuity of God's program would be broken because Jesus said, "I will be in you. I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you and me. That is unbroken continuity of the scripture. And then if we're only going to take if we're only going to take it on the on the basis that uh there are certain laws and certain principles of the scripture and I accept those I receive those I receive that as receiving Jesus Christ and I implement those certain uh attributes or those certain characteristics of the scripture and those certain laws and then I benefit from them. That's not what the gospel is all about. What the gospel is all about is that the whole sum and substance, the characteristics, the very nature of the the son of God is revealed once again in his people. &gt;&gt; And God looks upon it and he's glorified and and there isn't two. There's only one. Right. &gt;&gt; Actually, believe it or not, I've just been laying a foundation all this time. &gt;&gt; And he's full. Full f u l full. He's the only begotten of the father. I say Luke 17:30 when the son of man will again be revealed. That's the only son. &gt;&gt; And God did not send a handful of prophets to reveal him. &gt;&gt; God did not send a bunch of dignitaries to reveal him. God sent Malachi 4, one man, a prophet to reveal him. &gt;&gt; And that son of man was revealed. He's the only son. &gt;&gt; And that's the only word. And that word is full &gt;&gt; of grace &gt;&gt; and truth [Music] &gt;&gt; do you people believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm waring against the spirit of Leodysia because we have to war war against it because we become so almost contaminated and it and and Satan is so persistent to keep bombarding our minds with you know these are nice people and we accept this and accept that and accept something else and I say no he's the only son &gt;&gt; Hallelujah people resent that. &gt;&gt; They resent that singling out and identifying. &gt;&gt; But if it isn't that if it isn't that, friends, then then we're we're lost on an on a sea of &gt;&gt; of just opinion. &gt;&gt; We've got to have an absolute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is the absolute. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm narrowing it down. There's only one Jesus Christ. There's only one revealed word. There's only one Bible. And this is the Bible that God has written. It's not good news for man. And some of this other stuff that's been uh interpreted and translated. And you can see all kinds of Bibles in the bookstore. But I want a Bible that a prophet of God could read and say that that's the word of God. That's how it came down in our time. And the reason I say that is because after he would read it, after he would preach it and say, "If that God, the author of this word, doesn't come now and and prove himself and vindicate that what I've said is the truth. I'm a false prophet." And then see God come down and begin to reveal the secret of the heart and telling the people uh things that they didn't understand and had questions about. That's the God I'm talking about. I want that God to be my God. &gt;&gt; You can do what you wish with it. &gt;&gt; The word I'll say today, the word in this flesh is full of grace and truth. &gt;&gt; Unmmerited grace, &gt;&gt; unmmerited favor of God. &gt;&gt; We say yes, completely unworthy we are. But nevertheless, God &gt;&gt; had a desire &gt;&gt; and it's up to him who he chooses. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to say I want to be chosen. I think he chose me. That's not good enough. I know that he has chosen me to be a son of God. I fail him, but still that doesn't change me from being a son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I perhaps have done things perhaps in my life that my parents, God bless, their gallant souls. They may have been very disappointed to have seen and thought that maybe I could have made a better choice. But that doesn't change my birth. &gt;&gt; I was born in my household. I was born a biscal. and I will be that to my dying breath or till I'm translated or raptured. &gt;&gt; This message that God has so vindicated is clearly the favored child &gt;&gt; of this latter day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Clearly the favored child. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now folks, &gt;&gt; just listen. You that have lived this message, you've all experienced this. As it was in Jesus' time, as it was in the prophet's ministry, even so is it right now. &gt;&gt; People look back, they're captivated. Some they're aruck trying to figure you out. There's millions of people out there, but they're trying to figure you out. It's kind of, are you for real? They're mesmerized. Even some become gripped. I've got to find out a little bit more about this. And some are spellbound as they were in Jesus' time, as they were in the prophets time. They sat there just completely spellbound, gripped, mesmerized, aruck, and yet could not find the inner faith to accept him. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; They see it. &gt;&gt; They see it in your face. &gt;&gt; It's not you. It's the word of God prospering. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God doing what it was sent to do. &gt;&gt; It was sent to change you. It was sent to transform you. It was sent to make you a new creature in Christ Jesus. Not just quit drinking, smoking. That stuff there. That's that's not even in the books. Oh, I quit drinking. I quit. But those are attributes. &gt;&gt; But it turned you into a lover of Christ, &gt;&gt; a lover of the word, a lover of the message, &gt;&gt; and it turned you into a new creature, a different kind of a person with a different kind of attribute, different kind of appetites, &gt;&gt; and people looked on that, I'd like to be like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Deep in their heart. They don't want they don't say it, but they but they're caught by it. Something's gripped them. And it's the word of God prospering, taking you. It has achieved bringing you to this point. &gt;&gt; And you shall be witnesses &gt;&gt; unto me &gt;&gt; throughout the whole earth. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Is that what the scripture says? And that's what you're doing right there. Even though you you don't have to get there and do a whole lot of things and try and convert them, the word is already there achieving its goal &gt;&gt; and you're there as a testimony. You're there as a witness. You walk with the glory glory of God on your face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a whole lot more than a long dress and long hair. &gt;&gt; It's a whole lot more than just saying the right thing because you can say one thing and live another. But it's a life. I had a man say to me just this last week, "I haven't known you very long." He said, "But I've come to respect you. I respect you." And he's even wondering why he does that. There's just something the way maybe the way you conduct yourself or the way you handle yourself or the way you look at things or the way you respond to situations and they they admire it, &gt;&gt; right? Who is this person? What makes him that way? There's something there I admire, &gt;&gt; but to find the inner faith to say, "I want it." &gt;&gt; I think every once in a while of our brother Frank Fletcher here when the man who was designing supposed to design this church and the architect and he had such grand schemes and grand ideas, he had half the amount we committed to the whole church just committed to the roof. So we fired him and uh he ended up in Brother Frank Fletcher's shoe store way down towards university. Was it on Fourth Avenue, Brother Frank? Yeah, Fourth Avenue. Way down to university, 25 or 30 miles from here. He's He's just going in to buy a pair of shoes. Isn't that marvelous? Isn't that a miracle in the making? It is. It was. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because of because of this fellow, a fired architect of this church going in to buy a pair of shoes down towards the university grounds 2530 mi from here where brother Frank's sitting there selling shoes. And he's religious right up to his eyebrows. And he kept talking some about, you know, where the where I can find the truth. And brother Frank asks him a question somebody. You know where where can a person find the truth and find real Christians. Well fell says well he says I know some place. He said I know one place. He said it might be all right for you but he said it's it's too much for me. Think of that. Hundreds of churches. &gt;&gt; Hundreds of churches all around the country. and uh and and when he gets asked that kind of a question because there was something in brother Frank calling out. &gt;&gt; He wasn't calling for another church. He had he's gone to church. He has all kinds of things. &gt;&gt; And the religion religion is cruel. &gt;&gt; Religion costs a lot of lives. &gt;&gt; And may I say this and brother Frank will forgive me. Religion has cost him his wife. tore his wife away from him and his children. &gt;&gt; Religion, &gt;&gt; cruel, cruel religion. &gt;&gt; Religion that's been inspired by Satan. &gt;&gt; And he's lived alone all these years. An aspired architect saying, "Might be it for you, but it's not for me." &gt;&gt; But that's the only place he thought of. And brother Frank ends up coming in &gt;&gt; and the rest is history. No, &gt;&gt; the life of this son of man living in you is admired and respected and on the other hand it's despised and hated. It's such a to me it's it's such a strange it's something you can't reconcile. They'll admire it. They know it's truth but they will not accept it. &gt;&gt; And now I'm talking about not just that they don't have the inner strength to believe it but refuse it and reject it. And yet deep down in their heart of hearts, there's something witnessing saying it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I see something that I admire. Listen friends, I'm saying all that not to pump you up. Not to make you feel great. I just want to say this and I'm a long ways from being over and I'll try to make it short because I'll come back to this subject. It's not you. It is the word &gt;&gt; that is in you &gt;&gt; that is prospering. [Applause] &gt;&gt; To receive it is to be in God's favor. And to turn away from it is to be removed from God's favor. Now, I'm going to try to watch my time, but yet will you give me a little bit more time? And especially to you young people just out of camp. I've seen people in their walk, in their Christian walk, I'm talking about in this church, in this message, and other places where I've been, and they're real fervent for what they want to be fervent for, and then there gets to be other areas when doesn't fit them just exactly right. And so, they kind of exclude that out of their their life. And it kind of moved from that. At that point, that individual, whoever it might be, me, my wife, my family, or anyone here, you will start to suffer immediately from not following every word. Be not because you as an individual, but the word that you're not allowing to work in you cannot prosper. It's the word that prospers. &gt;&gt; It's not you. It's the word that prospers. As a person allows the life &gt;&gt; of the message and they receive it and they receive it and this one is will say this one is so compatible with you. But the next one is much more difficult. uh you know it might be for the wife, it might be for the husband, might have to do with the husband's responsibility and his spiritual headship and maybe he hasn't really taken that. I tell you what, do what you want. I'm a pastor, but I sit there and I I see the home suffer. I see the kids suffer. And then you see another home and you see the husband and he takes his place and takes his role and is a provider and he cares over the family. Maybe he's no great hero. Maybe he's not visible in the church. May maybe he's not someone who's who's up singing or playing an instrument or whatever more, but he just does his he plows along and he lives by every word and he loves that message with all of his heart. I tell you one thing, he is going to prosper. Amen. &gt;&gt; His children will prosper. &gt;&gt; His family will prosper. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not him that fell under such wonderful favor. It's the word, the son of God that is favored of the father and love of the father. And you that embrace him, you will fall under the same favor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I being clear? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the word that's favored. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So prosperity in the Old Testament referred to the realization of goals. As I said at the very beginning of the message, I'm going to be 10 minutes and then I'm going to close. The most important now here hear this closely. The most important to the Hebrews regarding prosperity was the spiritual dimension of prosperity. The spiritual aspect of prosperity. Eleazar's journey was made prosperous as he acted upon the word of Abraham and fulfilled his commission to bring a bride to Isaac. Eleazar was none other than the servant of this end time gone to get a bride. Now listen in in gen these are just selected verses. And the man Elazar sitting at the well wandering at her held his peace. He didn't say anything to whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not. He already had prayed. And here comes a young beautiful Rebecca and he's looking and he's wondering has God made his journey prosperous had nothing to do with material wealth their collection had to do with had he had he achieved his goal &gt;&gt; and the Bible says in uh 20 40th verse of that 24th chapter and he said unto me he's relating it now and the lord before whom I walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thee prosper thy way, and thou shalt take a wife for my son of the kindred of my father's house." In the 42nd verse, and I came this day unto the well, and I said, Oh Lord, God of my master Abraham, if now thou will do prosper my way, if thou if now thou do prosper my way which I go, and then when they wanted him to remain, Eleazar said to them, "Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered." Amen. &gt;&gt; He was looking for it &gt;&gt; when he began to see the bride. I can tell you friends, I haven't got enough time this morning when brother Brandon preaching to the thousands, but he knew his message and his ministry was to call out a bride. And then as things began to change and and and and be he began to sense different things happening, he was looking and he began to wonder, now maybe is the time. Now perhaps this is the this is the time in Zurich, Switzerland. Brother Brandham said to the people in my own nation, in my office the other day, there were 400 major cities calling Africa and all over the world. A time of open doors, a time of of I will say a prosperous ministry as far as the world would would uh uh consider it. And in the in the message, faithful Abraham, he said, I've come at the invitation of this fine group of men, ministers of the city and all around because I felt led to come here. He said, there's places waiting that's got tens of thousands of people gather all overseas, hundreds of places overseas, major cities in America and around. One was 1955 and this one was 1961 1963 said Reverend Roy Borders takes care of the invitations and since Christmas the first of the year there's been over a thousand invitations around the world. A thousand invitations has come back there. So the Lord has to direct me then also in the in in just 1962. I'm just backing up. And the spoken word is the original seed. And for those of you that know that very lengthy message, it's it's it's very different. He says, and he says this, we believe that we're in the end time, do we? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Do we do you believe that before you have a crop, now you have to plant a seed. He asked those two questions. He said, "You see why I've let churches turn me out. Tell me everything. call me all kinds of names and everything else and just stay right with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In investments then in 63 he said we find all the other church ages Jesus was still in the church. All the six church ages Jesus was in the church. What's he doing is identifying his own ministry. Jesus was in the church but on the Leodysian age he was on the outside knocking trying to get in. This is the age &gt;&gt; when the manifestation of Christ come so perfect in the image of Christ in his church until the churches as a brother said a while ago is closing the doors and yet he stands in love with love knocking. If any man hunger or thirst, he says, asks the people, do you understand? And he said, we expect a closed door. &gt;&gt; It's the Leodysian age, and the Bible said it would be that way. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning, friends? I said back in Joseph in Jesus life and his visit on earth and the manifestation of Jesus Christ according Luke 17:30 and here here the prophet manifesting that goes to the scripture and translates it in what's happening in front of him and he says there's thousands uh hundreds of churches 400 a thousand invitation doors are open they wear in Jesus time everybody wanted this young prophet from Nazareth. But in his life as he began to bring the word now the prophet goes to Leodysian church age and says in all six he was inside the church. In the seventh he was outside the church. He said the doors are closing. I expect that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know this isn't this isn't just watered down milk. Amen. &gt;&gt; We expect that. &gt;&gt; What do we expect? Exactly the same thing. &gt;&gt; We don't expect to become more accepted. Don't expect to become more popular. Don't don't expect that the world will become uh uh more more palatable to us. Not at all. And we're not going to design the services just so they become palatable to the world. We're not interested in the world. We're interested in what the word says is to happen in our time. and happen in our life. &gt;&gt; And what we are to manifest me for my part, this is the only son of God. &gt;&gt; There is none other. This revealed word is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he's going to be loved by some, hated by others. It's going to be held in awe, going to be respected, and yet the people who respect him won't be able to receive him. And because he's living in you, in your flesh, you are going to experience these things. &gt;&gt; And we must not under any conditions be shocked when that happens. And it does happen on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; I'm absolutely dumbfounded. People respect it to such a to such a degree. They they they see your home or see your family or see whatever. I said, "What is the matter with your mind? Why would you go in utter destruction? &gt;&gt; Why do you go the way that you go and let Satan destroy you? &gt;&gt; Tell me people, &gt;&gt; why would anyone want to do that? &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help me. He gets to the seventh seal. Hey friends, I had I didn't dream this sermon up. It's come come come over a lot of days and a lot of thought, a lot of preparation. He gets to the seventh seal and he begins to speak things would be absolute mysteries to people and those that know the message and have received it, then you you can you can love. And he says, "Now, when this gets on tape," and you should do what I do, just read whatever came before that. This this is paragraph 325, I think, paragraph 567 or page 567, I'm sorry, paragraph 3. When this gets on tape, which it is, that'll probably send 10,000 of my friends away from me. And they're going to say that brother Brandham's trying to make himself and make himself a servant or a prophet or something before God. And let me tell you, my brethren, that's an error. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the first part of it they did &gt;&gt; he lost tens of thousands of his friends but they won't come down to the next part when he says that's an error. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to I wish that people would be honest at least I wish that they would give a man his day in court. All right. &gt;&gt; I've had leaders, Pentecostal leaders in this office right here and hand me say, "Have you read this?" I looked at I said, "No." "What about this?" Look, they had all highlighted stuff. I said, "No, don't believe I've seen that either." "What about this?" "No, I don't think I've seen that one." "And this?" "Yeah, I've seen that one. I've read that." Oh. He said, "Do you know that you have the same understanding, the same belief of the Godhead that the Jehovah's Witnesses do?" I said, "No, I don't think so." He said, "You people believe that Jesus was that Jesus was created?" Well, I says, "The seed that he came from was Oh," he says, "Come on now." He said, I said, "Well, who was Jesus?" Jesus was God. I said, "I believe that. I believe that. I said, "Did your God come out of a woman's womb?" &gt;&gt; And did your God Did your God actually gasp? Your God, that's all that just God. Did he gasp his last breath on the cross and actually die? He died. Did your God go? Did Did your God die? And he stopped me silent. I said, 'You don't even know what you believe, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Said he was the manifestation &gt;&gt; of God in the flesh. &gt;&gt; He was God's very God. &gt;&gt; And before Abraham was, I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, he says, "There's a man, one of our ministers downtown in Broadway Tabernacle. He really understands that Godhead." He says, "Would you meet him?" I said, 'Absolutely. happy to meet him. And the meeting was set up and somebody forgot it or canceled it. It wasn't me and it never happened. Then I said, "Have you got a minute?" I said, "I want to read a scripture to you." I said, "Have you ever heard of the serpent seed?" "No." I said, "I want to read Corinthians 11 for you. Bear with me in my folly and indeed bear with me. Apostle Paul says,"For I'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I have espoused you to one husband, even Christ, that you might be chasteed virgin to Christ." I said he's talking about virginity. He's talking about chastity. But I fear lest as the serpent, exactly as the serpent beguiled Eve. So your mind shall be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Jesus that is in Christ. I says the original sin was a sexual sin. And he made about three four pages. He said, "Never heard of it in my life." I said, "Well, there's something for you to study." I said, "And if you don't believe that, you interpret those verses for me. You tell me what happened." I said, "Never heard of it. See friends, there is a power and a strength that maybe you don't realize and you really need to give a lot of thought to it. &gt;&gt; So I want to I want this word to live in me richly. &gt;&gt; You won't expect open doors all of the time. Doors are closing. The Bible tells us that even after Moses had met with God and God spoke to him from the burning bush, yet God allowed him hard times to buffet him and to knock him down and to have difficulty. And so I would take two parts. I said God prosperity as a favored son, prosperity in adversity. And God allowed Moses even after he had met God in such a reality knocked him down. The prophet said buffeted him, knocked him down and turned him around. And he got right up and said, "I know it's right. I met God, and I'm going to take I'm going to take them out yonder." Even because he had he had the I would say Moses prospered in that he was determined to achieve the commission that God had given him. &gt;&gt; I want you to ask yourself, I've come to the end here. I'm running out of time, but I want you to ask yourself, what did God elect me for? &gt;&gt; What did God choose me for? What is my calling in life? I will say for the most part, wherever you are, your calling in life is to be a vibrant manifestation of the word, the message. And you cannot do that unless you are a hearer of it &gt;&gt; and a believer of it. &gt;&gt; I've got to take a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; It's only one service today. The price of our redemption required the bruising, the crushing of the rose of Sharon. And Isaiah describes it this way. He describes the bruising of Jesus Christ in a strange language. Listen very, very close. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. It pleased the Lord. It is not that God stood back and while Jesus was suffering the ignaminious death on Calvary that God was uh you know rubbing his hands with glee and delight and saying I'm so pleased with that. That's not what it was. God without knowing a beginning or an ending could see beyond the price, &gt;&gt; beyond the suffering, &gt;&gt; beyond the pain and the agony, he could see beyond it. And when he when he could see what it was going to accomplish, &gt;&gt; listen friends, &gt;&gt; I'm bring it down to you. Your many times things happen in your life and my life in our home and in our in our journey through life. Things happen and we say, "Why is this happening? &gt;&gt; Why do I have to go through this?" But if you could see what is beyond that, &gt;&gt; then you could even rejoice in the difficulty, &gt;&gt; you could say, I know that my God is in control of my life, &gt;&gt; and I don't know what this is doing, but I have confidence that the word &gt;&gt; that I have embraced &gt;&gt; and that I love &gt;&gt; will come to its accomplishment. Because that word is ordained to prosper. &gt;&gt; You may have nothing in the world materially or you may have much in the world materially. It's completely irrelevant. &gt;&gt; One might be a a person doesn't know where their next meal is coming from. One person may be healthy and the next person is sickly. That is irrelevant. whatever we're going but it is what is the condition of the word in your life. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you the word of God is ordained to prosper. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know this will be misunderstood, but when I was under the influence and people had given me a very very negative report concerning brother William Brandham. And I was a young minister of 27, 26 when I wrote the letter and invited him to come up to the north country where I was still living. And then I left and brother Brett and an became the pastor of that church. And I came down here and I was just three weeks in Victoria and I got the letter. After 18 months, I got a response. Had he'd like to come up and maybe hunt if we could arrange the hunt. In my heart were huge. I can say three questions. Listen friends, they were like lead weights in my heart. And the only thing I knew, I'd seen something in this man's ministry. And I did believe that the angel of the Lord who I didn't know at that time was none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. I knew that an angel I could not escape the blind girl being healed. Could never escape. And I couldn't escape the presence that I sensed in those meetings. And I was around other ministers. I think the best in the country. And we were just going out to the pulpit in one service and two ministers got into a row. They got into a bitter dispute about something. I don't remember what it is. And that dispute was so sharp and I was so wounded that I broke into sobs and tears. There just the three of us in the office. I just was so broken I couldn't hardly go out into the service. And I thought I is is this and these men are now going to go out in the platform before the people and this is the atmosphere they've just come out of. And I was I was like a child. I was just I'm on the verge of tears now. I remember it so well. I was just so broken. And then I've been around other ministers and heard them, you know, tell stories and tell jokes and so on and hehaw and laugh and some of them were kind of colored. I've walked out of places where so-called Christians were when off-colored stories were told by ministers. &gt;&gt; I got my family up and walked out. Tell you friends, those things register very very deep on my heart. And that's the state I was in. That's the condition I was in when I finally met brother Brandon personally. And to me, he was not one that I was going to have interpret the word to me. And I said in my young heart, if he tries to circumvent the word of God, our friendship is over. That's how serious it was to me. And looking back, listen close. I'm not just telling a story. Here is how here's the summary. And I hope you understand this. I regarded brother Brandham as a man of God with beliefs and doctrines that I did not understand. And furthermore, I didn't believe that the stories have been told me was correct. So, I put them aside. I said, "He's a man of God, and I know that he's got people pulling at him from all over. I just want to give him a rest. That's all I want to do. I want to give him a rest. And I will not trouble him. I will not ask him a bunch of questions that I did not." And he came to Grand Prairie and he came to Dawson Creek. and brother brother Ba actually you'll hear his voice leading the song service in that Dawson Creek series and we get in the car and we'd be starting to travel but as the people walked past people from my own church walked past and he told them they told sister Clint something told this sister something and this other sister and different people and and and and brother Paul Corny standing right beside me and a whole line of people around the church like that coming up for prayer and brother Brandham's becoming weak and and he may most of you have never heard this and he's getting weak and he's just weaving a wee bit and he's speaking to people and I I just don't know about the doctrine. I don't know what he what he teaches. All I know is what he's saying to these people is true because I know those people. And then he says, "The boy will be all right." And just keeps and turns right around, keeps talking to the person in front of him. And it was, believe me now, there's no imagination, a force went past like that. Brother Paul Cornish is a tall, dignified theologian, Bible school teacher. And he just went like this. He was standing right here beside me. He just went like this. And he was sobbing, sobbing. And I thought, "What? What's happening?" I felt it. It just went past me. And here he is. Here they yelled. I had to even think what it was. The boy will be all right. Now, who's he talking about? Who's the boy? Why is this pastor like that? And after a few minutes, and brother Brandham carries right on like nothing happened. And after a few minutes or a few moments, Brother Cornish stands up, pokes me on the arm. He said, "Brother Eddie, you see that boy down the end of the line? I think he was third from the end or something like that. Just from the end, that boy teenager." I said, "Yes." He said, "That's my son." He said, "He's up for an operation this next week." And that was what he re I thought, "What? What is that? What realm is that? What dimension is that man in? Where is he?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Just standing there and hear a boy down there. The boy will be all right. And the man is collapsing and convulsing with tears and he carries on. What kind of dimension is that in? And we had the next day were on the on the trip. And you that have heard my How many here have not heard I'm a witness? You've not heard I'm a witness that testimony. My testimony. Okay. Most all have. God bless you. on there. The next day, we're driving past Brother Brett and Sister Anne's hometown where they had lived and farmed. And we're just driving past and the first the first exit into the town is here. Brother Brand was driving. He's slowing down. Said there was a woman uh in the prayer line yesterday. He said, I believe she was from Fort St. John. She was praying for a man from Fort St. John. Oh, I said, "Brother Brandham," I said, "That happens to be an old family friend of my mother and dad." And I said, "She's uh yeah, I know her real well." And he said, "She's praying for a man dying with cancer." And he's just driving slowly now because there's a speed limit. Driving slowly. Old farmhouse amongst the service stations and motel. Old farmhouse where the US Army caught a highway straight through the farm and that big old white house sat there and knew it ever since I was a little boy. And we're just driving past and he says he he he just goes like this like he's in another realm and he throws his arm behind my head now. But he says the man's in that house in that same presence and the devil is always right there. You know the devil is just as real and he's just as active. And as soon as I Brother Brandham said that, a voice said to me, "How do you know he's in that house?" So, would you doubt that? Oh, tell you what, there's doubts are always around. And I got up 375 miles up the Alaskan Highway and I'm talking to brother Bud Southwick, 375 miles up the highway. And I start to tell brother Southwick about Brother Brand. I'm pointing to that house. And Bud says, "Well, that's true. I know the man. I've known him ever since I've been a child. And I also know that he's dying with cancer." So, I had it on the platform, had it driving past the man's house, and now had it up up there in Brother Southwick's little trailer. And I'll say this, this is where I wanted to come to. And I hope you have time. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can say all I wanted to do was to be good to the servant of God. That's all I wanted to do. And I can tell you from that time as I gave myself to the word and soon as we had the little house and there's brother Don Alexander and a few that are here and sister Gerta were in that house and the first thing I wanted to do and the young people come in. I said just get those tapes and listen to those tapes. I knew those tapes had something I couldn't give them. Let's get those tapes. And I just saw young men, young women delivered and changed and coming off the streets and coming out of the flames of hell. What was it, friends? And people said, and then I had the Anglican minister and they they were hoping and other churches in the community hoping that I would just sift somehow these young people into their churches because they could see they could see there was a life. They could see there was a power. You know what the Anglican minister came over to my house? You know what he said to me? He said, "We have a coffee house in the basement." when he says they're they're right out they're out and under the trees. He said having drugs and sex and he was sick and what is it that you have? And he was hoping that our young people kind of help their young people. No, that's not what it's all about. &gt;&gt; And it took me some time to realize this has nothing to do with me. &gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with me. And I saw the place pack out. Saw the log church built. Saw how it was built. I could write books about it. Saw how it became packed out. How the people were children sleeping on the floor. Couldn't even move. Couldn't even get out of the foyer. Couldn't hardly move. And saw that happen. Saw this place happen. And what is happening today? I remember the first day I walked out here. Saw the people that were sitting here. I thought we're going to be raptured. This place is going to be empty. And I'll tell you what, friends, I'm going to make an announcement right now. This has nothing to do with brother Ed Biscll's ministry. &gt;&gt; This has something to do with the prosperity of the word of God. &gt;&gt; And God is not going to allow that word to fail. It shall accomplish what it has been sent to do because it is the word that is prospering. No man's ministry is prospering. The word is prospering. And I say that to you, you brothers, you husbands, you families, God's word is ordained to prosper. You live by it. You embrace it. You hold to it. And whatever happens in life, say, "Thank God." &gt;&gt; However he leads me. &gt;&gt; Gives me much, gives me nothing. Just live for him. Live for this word. Put this word out before you and be good to it. &gt;&gt; I tell you, my brother, my sisters, there's a lot of things I can't promise be. I can tell you one thing. Your life will be fulfilled. You'll have such a feeling. And if God should call me off the scene, I can tell you one thing. I go a happy man. &gt;&gt; I thank God. I thank God for the family of God. I thank God that God's allowed me to walk with you. I'm glad that you are here. I'm glad for the atmosphere of the congregation. And you that have recently come, we receive you in the name of Jesus Christ. And if God ever calls you to go elsewhere, I say God bless you. But go wherever the word is put forth &gt;&gt; first. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there is no big eyes in the ministry. &gt;&gt; There is no big ministries in this message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you, great men and great women are those that put the word forth first. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you. &gt;&gt; I appreciate what God has done in your lives. I appreciate the testimony of God in the supernatural in your lives. And I pray God will ever ever bless you and that you shall prosper as you put forward forth and and put put the word first in everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been much longer than I wanted to be. We have a baptismal and perhaps the sister can just get ready now. And I would like to sing once again if they would come please. Uh I'd like to sing more of you once again. Then I want to sing I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. Old things have passed away. I've been born again. You understand, friends? [Music] I have much more that I want to say. And I could have come here and blow it all out at once, but I feel it's important I lay some of these principles down and tell you from my heart to your heart. Live by every word of God that he makes known, makes real to you. Let's bow our heads in prayer, please. and we shall stand. Change your position. Dear Father, we've attempted by the Holy Ghost to speak those things that you've made. So real. I've declared today, Lord, that your word, your word has been sent to prosper, and it shall prosper. It shall accomplish. It is full. It is rich with mercy and grace. And in a congregation of this size and the congregation that is on the internet, it's not possible. But what there is great needs and serious needs and the people have come. Lord, they've gathered. I pray they will not have to go out with the same need, but that your word will go and minister to them now. Send your word and heal them, Lord. Heal the home, heal the life. &gt;&gt; Heal, oh God, not only physically but spiritually. And I pray that you will instill a determination within men and women, oh God, of all ages, that they will give themselves unreservedly to the word that you have made alive and living and real in this day. Oh God, allow this people, I pray, to be in full support of what they hear. Lord, I pray that they will be in full support of what you are doing. And we're so thankful that a young sister is being baptized today. You've moved upon her heart and the waters here and she will be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Pray you'll move on others, oh God, throughout the congregation, Lord. whatever their need is, may their confession change from a negative to a positive confession in Jesus Christ's name. I commit the word spoken to you now. And Lord, you confirm it. If it is the truth, then you will confirm it. It is your word. We thank you, Lord Jesus. We love you. We want more of you. [Music] Lord, you I might Are you [Music] my but I [Music] Lord hear my I you are you are you I for you. All things I have my [Music] heart [Music] and Lord hear my prayer for you. It might be that you would like to blend a prayer with me. Say, "Lord, let me thirst after you until it is exactly, as the prophet of God has said, a painful experience. I want to thirst after you." For you said, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness." What does it say? They shall be filled. Oh God. Oh God. What a glorious thing that we can hunger and thirst. Doesn't have to be some big excitement. I just hunger after you, oh God. There's something that I need from you. Would you come now and provide that? I'm praying more of you. This is our prayer, Lord. More of you. [Music] I have all I need is for you. [Music] All things I am [Music] Lord hear my prayer for you. &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. I'm a new creation. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] for that's why I am a new creation. I'm a brand new man. &gt;&gt; I want to know if the congregation got a hold of the theme of the service this morning. God's word. God has sent forth this word and it is ordained. I declare with my last breath on earth if needs be. It is ordained to prosper. It shall accomplish what has been sent to do. And as you receive it within your own being and let it work out throughout your your uh uh your enablement or your facility, the body that God gave you, you shall prosper. Your home shall prosper. Hallelujah. Your family shall prosper. Glory to God. And in the face of defeat, in the face of adversity, in the midst of your prison, you shall prosper. because it's the word that's ordained to come to its conclusion. Amen. Hallelujah. [Music] All things have passed away and born again. I wish him for the people said hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Natalie Fzen standing here this morning because God has dealt with her. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I believe the sun of prosperity is shining upon the freezing home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said this in Matthew 3 verse 11 says, "I indeed baptize you with water into repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire." It's a tremendous thing to understand what God is doing in people's lives. There was a whole Chicago set of meetings. Brother Bram talked about having a revival &gt;&gt; and we just had camp and brother Bram said they had a revival in Chicago and that revival was one little girl &gt;&gt; gave her heart to Christ &gt;&gt; and walked on with God. And I believe Natalie, you're our little revival. &gt;&gt; May the Holy Ghost and fire come down and burn your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. You tell the people what you told me. You said that the Lord dealt with you and you felt what kind of pull. When did that happen? &gt;&gt; Last year at camp. &gt;&gt; Last year at camp. I asked Natalie. I said, "Natalie, do you know that the Lord's come to your life?" She said, "I do. He came to my life last year at camp." And I said, 'Well, how come you weren't baptized until now? She says, 'It's now I feel the pull.' &gt;&gt; And I say, 'May God so pull you into the kingdom of God, Natalie. So baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. And may God ever be present leading your life. Let's pray. Put your hands together. Lord, a great joy this morning. Sister Reena, Brother A can rejoice and truly say the sun of prosperity has arisen and shone upon their home this day. Natalie stands here, Lord, because she has felt the pull of God. She desires that the fire would fall, that the Holy Ghost would so fill her soul. Lord, she's committed her life to you. Wants to be a light for you. Desires, Lord, that your glory would fill her temple and be led by your spirit. Father, I commit this soul into your divine care. Lord, lead her faithfully. We pray for when the spirit of truth has come, you shall lead her, Lord, into all truth. Great baptizer, baptize her now. We pray in Jesus name. And sister Natalie, by your confession that Jesus Christ is your savior, I baptize you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] [Applause] Well, last year after camp, I think it was about 36 someone's baptized. I guess they all got baptized last year. Oh, they come up. I'm I tell you what, it's uh just such a joy to see those that are coming. And last year, a year ago, it was just such a different atmosphere. and everybody noticed it. But I said, "Well, what's happened?" Of course, those that came in just there were a lot of new ones, just beginners, you know, they just can't got up into into the senior camp a year ago and now they're a year older and they've experienced a lot of things and it was really wonderful. And I've had others I've said I've had visitors say to me, "It's so marvelous just to see young men and young women rising up and taking their place." And uh it's so wonderful. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm I'm just so tickled about it. So pleased with it. Amen. Uh I'm going to sing a song or have you sing a song. faith of our fathers living still. And I don't know if Matthew would like to or could sing with that uh group that sang when they sing a song like that. I think hearing it twice is if I heard it on a CD or something, I'd want to hear it again. And maybe they could get ready and just sing it again for us. I I think it's marvelous. If the group could come and sing it if it's possible, fine. And if it's not possible, that's fine also. But we'll sing uh faith of our fathers living still. Why don't we stand as we sing? And we can't sing this song sitting down. of our father living still his fire [Music] with that glorious Earth. [Music] We will be true to the children. Our father changing praise and dark and free. How sweet would be their children [Music] we will be to thee. We faith on our We will fall in [Music] love by kindly words and Oh, we will be true to Jesus. [Applause] This last week, we took our brother Brian and sister Jenny over to Vancouver Island. And uh in Victoria, for those of you that have been there, you know they have all kinds of people selling their wares and doing their things right on the inner harbor. And at the end, right in front of the parliament buildings, they always have native Indian people that are there and they're doing the different things, bead work, etc., etc. And my wife says, "I always like to know where people are from." And I try to urge her to stop asking people questions because we get into big conversations and I'm I'm the I'm the impatient one in the family. I want to keep moving. says, "I just love to know where this these young fellas are from." Uh, so anyway, she steps up, starts talking, and so I step up. Both of them are sitting there. One has got a face that he's been through. Terrible, terrible life. So, beaten, broken. You can see his face has been broken and disfigured. And uh, I've seen that scene many times. And so she's talking to this one fellow and she asked him where are you from? Oh, he said just a little place up, you know, up at the island. But but what what village? He said. Oh, she said we've been to Clue many times. And then I stepped closer and she said, "Do you know Jack Patrick?" Because Jack Patrick was the chief and the pastor. said, ' Do you know Jack Patrick? He said, ' It's my grandfather. &gt;&gt; And so then I stepped up. I said, cuz Pinky was one of his sons. I said, "Do you know Pinky?" He said, "He's my dad." I said, "Your dad when he was 18 carved me a totem pole, which I still have." Oh. And then they began to and this other fellow was wanting to kind of turn away, you know, and he'd look at us for a bit and then they were sitting right together. So, um, I said, "We've been to your place many times. We stayed in your house, in your grandfather's house. We slept there and stayed there." And I said, uh, it was his father that we walked together after a series of meetings when I preached there. And he went walking with me out on the ocean, climbing over the big rocks. And he was picking and I was helping him pick the sea urchins and he'd crack them open and eat that egg that's in there, you know, that big purple sea urchin. And uh, I ate most everything. I couldn't get to that. And then the big sea slugs, they would get those big sea slugs and boil them. They'd turn orange and eat the inside of that. And and I never got that victory either. So I it was his dad and I was just leaving the last time I remember. I was just leaving and there you know the Indian people don't have many words and he just said I'm going to miss you and that just like stabbed my heart. That was my last memory of his dad. He said, "My dad's living in a hotel over here." And then I said, "Well, we've been different, you know, the Nitnet Bamfield and different house it over to Al Bernie." I said, "We know the the Dick family, Allan." And uh just forget their name now. His mother, his his wife, brother and sister Dick. He said, "That's" and then this fellow was all twisted up. He says, "That's my grandparents. Oh, I said, 'Well, we were to Agnes Dick's funeral. He said, "Yeah." He said, "When you stepped up here, I recognized you." He said, "I remember you being at her funeral." They said, "Our girls sang at the funeral." She He said, "Yeah, I remember that, too." And there we were just out of the masses of people, two two grandsons of people that we both ministered to all their for all that time and their parents were in brother Bram's meetings and I thought that was a great joy. Amen. You may be seated with Matthew. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Joseph lived a life of hurt and hatred. And even his own family brought him pain. And when his brothers thought that he would surely seek revenge, he said, "I have seen God's purpose now [Music] made plain." It was the tender hand [Music] over. I look back and see. He was always leading me. [Music] The word was meant for me. Oh, God has used to show me his great love. I now understand the tender hand of Jehovah. [Music] Many Jews were killed and saw us under. [Music] And it seemed that God had left his very own. [Music] Oh, but through it all, God had a plan. Little did they know, oh, that he would lead all of his children back home. [Music] So how can I deny his great hand of mercy? Oh trles they came and they left no reason why [Applause] and say that everything has worked out for my go. Oh, he has all he has the answers for my life. It was the table. [Music] I look back and see he was always leading me and what was made for me. Oh God has used to show me his love. I now understand the hand of Jehovah was made for me to show his love. I now understand. I now understand. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Your hand [Applause] tender hand. Oh, [Music] [Applause] sometimes it takes a while before we understand that tender hand of Jehovah. Brother Tony, would you come and dismiss us in prayer? Let's rise to our feet. And we're happy to have brother Tony back. Brother Murphy was with him as well and we happy for the work that God goes on &gt;&gt; and it is because of the prosperity of the word of God. Amen. God bless you, brother Tony. Amen. Heavenly Father, how blessed we are to be able to be called the sons and daughters of God. For Lord Jesus, as our father, you know how to give good gifts to your children. And certainly we can say today that we have received the most precious gift of all, the very life of your word, living and residing and dwelling with him. And Lord, as we would go this day our separate ways, Lord, may we realize aresh again what is tabernacled in these bodies of flesh and clay. Oh Lord, that it is your word and that your word in us will never ever ever pass away. Lord, that same word will meet every need. And Lord Jesus, as the people would go, Lord, we send them in the name of Jesus Christ with that blessing, with that power of your Holy Spirit, that pillar of fire that was seen resident over the word, the the blessed of one of Joseph, you the word made revealed in this day, Lord, how you dwelt amongst that word and showed yourself pleasing with that word. Lord, may that same pillar of fire go with each and every one of us and meet every need in divine glory. How we thank you for the word today. Thank you for a faithful servant for brother Ed.
