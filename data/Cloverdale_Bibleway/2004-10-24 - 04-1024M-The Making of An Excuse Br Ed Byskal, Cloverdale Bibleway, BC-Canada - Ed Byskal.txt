========================================
to their strength. They shall mount up with wings that eagles. Oh, they shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to way. [Music] Amen. Is that your desire? Just wait upon the Lord and he will renew your strength. Amen. I want to welcome everyone this morning. Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Trust he brought you a little lick of fire. &gt;&gt; Come expecting. I'd like to sing the sing a little chorus uh before we get started. I like to sing He is here. Hallelujah. He is here. Amen. may do some things a little different this morning, but we just want to enter into an atmosphere of worship. Let the Lord have his way. He is here. Hallelujah. [Music] He is here. Amen. [Music] He is here. Oh, holy, holy, I will bless his holy name. He is here. I'll listen [Music] here and calling out your name. He is here. Oh, you can't change him. You will never be the same. Before we sing it again, I'd like the senior choir to come and get ready at this time. Sing it again. He is here. Oh, hallelu is here. [Music] Amen. He is here. Oh, holy, holy. I will bless his holy name. [Music] is here. I'll listen and go to sleep here calling out your name in him for you can't touch it. You will never be the same. Amen. Aren't you glad that you are never we're never the same when he touch your life? &gt;&gt; Song that we're going to I would like to start the song service off this morning with is a song that Sister Margaret sang a while back. He'll do it again. Just take a look where you are, where you are now, where you've been. He'll do it again. There's a a little quote I want to read before we sing. And it's uh it's from Have Have Not I Sent Thee. And it's Brother Brandon preached in Phoenix, Arizona. He says here, "Now if God give you an evidence of the Holy Ghost like he appeared to Moses in the fire back there and let him know that he was God, then then you ought if if you've seen God heal others like Moses throwed his stick down once and he knowed he would do it again, turning it turn it to a serpent, he knowed he was God and that he and then what he done once he can do again. Just like the prophet said to Gideon, "The God of your fathers brought you up out of Egypt and brought all these mercies and things. He will do it again." That's right. Well, the God that healed the sick is a God that healed you. The God that gave the Holy Ghost back there is a God that give it to you. The God that healed Hattie Waldrup there of cancer lying dead in the line will heal you. Sure, he's God. That's all. If you expect to see his mighty miracles and his power, then first accept his word and act upon it. Sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter what you're going through, he is still God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I just wrote down here this morning, you may be like Sister Hadtie. Or you may have a loved one that's not serving God. He will restore. And I want to tell you that he will restore. He will heal you. He's God. Amen. And that's what we want to sing song this morning. Start song service off. He will do it again. Amen. Sister Margaret. [Music] You may feel down and feel like God has somehow forgotten. [Music] That you are faced with circumstances you can't get through. Right now, it seems like there's no way out and you're going under. But God's proven time and time again, he'll take care of you. And he'll do it again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He'll do it again. He'll do it again. &gt;&gt; If you just take a look at where you were now, and where you haven't he come through for you. &gt;&gt; He's the same now as then. &gt;&gt; Don't you know God cannot fail? &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know when, but he'll do it again. [Music] God knows the pain that you're going through, and he knows how you're hurting. You see, he knows just like your heart has been broken into. But he's the God of the stars and of the sun and of the sea. And he is your father. He can calm the storm and find a way to fix it for you. And he'll do it again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He'll do it again. He'll do it in again. &gt;&gt; If you just take a look at where you are now, &gt;&gt; and where you been, he always come through for you. &gt;&gt; He's the same now as then. &gt;&gt; Don't you know God cannot fail? &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know it, try to do it again. Oh, he's still God. &gt;&gt; He's still &gt;&gt; and he will not fail you. Oh, he's still God. He will not change. Oh, I know that he's gone. [Music] And he's fighting for you. Just like Moses, &gt;&gt; like Moes. &gt;&gt; Just like Daniel. &gt;&gt; Just like Shadrach. Me up and they go. He'll do it again. &gt;&gt; He'll do it again. will do it again. &gt;&gt; If you just take a look at where you are now &gt;&gt; and where you been hasn't he always come through &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; He's the same now and then. &gt;&gt; Don't you know God cannot fail? &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know when. try to do it again. &gt;&gt; And you may not know how. &gt;&gt; You may not know how. &gt;&gt; And you may not know when. &gt;&gt; You may not know when. &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know when. But I'm glad he'll do it again. again. Do it again. [Music] I want the choir to help us. Why don't we all stand? I want to sing.

So, he wants to thank the Lord for that. Amen. Our brother Philig Gary testimony here.

I would like to thank the Lord for strengthening my vision. She says, "Praise the Lord." And sister uh Margaret has a prayer request. Pray for my dad who suffered a stroke, is doing much better, but pray that the Lord will do a complete work in his body and soul. Also pray for my brother who's who needs the Lord to undertake for him in a mighty way. So we want to remember these these needs.

And we thank you, Lord God, for the opportunity to come to church once again, Lord. We just pray that you'll be with the remainder of the service in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Hey man, you may have your seats. [Music] Amen. I want to welcome everyone this morning name of our Lord Jesus Christ. If you're visiting with us and we haven't made mention of you, we just trust you feel welcome. And as present, those on the telephone hookup and on the internet, we want to say God bless you to you also. Amen. And as brother Red's going to come this morning and and bring the word, I'd like to sing that song number 200. And uh I think actually it's maybe 2006 or 2306, I think. Great is thy faithfulness. Can't read my writing. So great is thy faithfulness. [Music] Has been faithful to you. Amen. Great is thy faithfulness, oh God, my father. There is no shadow on turning with thee.

Hol come Holy Spirit let your fire up once again. Oh come Holy Spirit. Let your fire. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How we appreciate his presence. &gt;&gt; This gathering would be all in vain if it was not for his abiding presence. And it would be in vain even if his presence was here. here if we didn't recognize that presence. And so we are here to recognize that presence. We're here to respect it. We're here to give ourselves unreservedly to it. I sure certainly appreciated the worship service this morning as I was just preparing, you know, myself for the ministry of the word and listening to our brother Jason as he led the song service. Uh, I I trust that you all were entering in. It certainly sounded like it and uh to have Sister Margaret. Margaret, that song has been on my mind for so long. I was so happy to hear you sing it again. And I really appreciate it. He'll do it again. And you can sing it again. As far as I'm concerned, I think it's good to give him glory. He'll do it again. Hallelujah. I appreciate the congregation. appreciate each one of you and uh God appreciates you. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to be flowery. I'm saying that because often we feel we get lost in the crowd. You're not lost in the crowd. People are uh affected by your presence. Uh, our brother Aubrey Hunt spoke on Wednesday and after the service was over, uh, we just stepped into the back and I said, uh, I said, uh, the church was full. He said, packed. I said, uh, they didn't know you were going to be here. They didn't know there was any guest speaker. I said, that was a a regular Wednesday service. And I said, "Often you find churches that have relaxed and on Wednesday they're not there. Just a very small percentage of people that are there." Yes. He said, as he's traveled around the country, he said, you know, they can't get them out and just on the weekend. I said, well, I said, I've noticed that myself and I appreciate. So you don't know what effect that has on a minister to go home and say it doesn't have to be empty on Wednesday night. There doesn't have to just be a handful there. They they are renewed in their strength and their energy and their vigor and their faith and and you you are the ones that are giving testimony to that. You're testifying to that by your presence. And this morning I could I could wait on God and prepare myself. What good would it be if you weren't here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Well, I'm just one of, you know, a few hundred people that that is irrelevant." You have a very, very real part. And I want to know that I appreciate the congregation. I appreciate the standard, the individual standard. Uh just my wife and I speaking on the way here to church today. If there's anything that I would like to do, I'd like to raise the standard. I'd like to raise it higher. Don't relax it, but raise it higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I appreciate the deacons. Appreciate their wives, their families. Appreciate the standard that they hold, the trustees. Appreciate them. are the Sunday school teachers and how devoted they are. I appreciate that. The school Bible way Christian Academy and the the the teachers how they are giving themselves to our children or the next generation that will fill these important places if the Lord Jesus allows time to go on. So I I certainly appreciate the testimony. We could go back and say, "Well, uh, how was it? You know, don't don't you wish that, uh, it was back when the church was small?" Well, not really. Not really. Uh, uh, I believe that a family needs to be having children. And, uh, and that's what we're doing. Not just physically, even though that is happening, and we're happy for that, but we're we're happy for the spiritual children. And I'm thankful for the testimony that is able to go out. Brother Lance uh Laroo is in Seattle today ministering. I'm thankful for that. &gt;&gt; I'm happy that you can have confidence that such a man as a brother Lance is who you have such confidence in is preaching the gospel, preaching this message in Seattle. and brother Tony and sister Rebecca are in India. Maybe many here perhaps do not know, but they will be visiting Iran on the way back. And you want to pray for them. That is not a very easy place to be in. And we need them to have Holy Spirit direction and wisdom. There is a pastor in Iran and they will be with him. So uh uh the brother from Usbekiststan, brother Anatoli I believe it is, he is still in America and I expect to see him this next week. Uh but he had a very difficult time in Spokane. He was treated very very very badly by some denominational people. Of course, we don't expect an easy time amongst them, but uh but you were a strength to him. You were you ministered something to him, and we're thankful for that. Uh we're thankful also for brother Murphy, the voices, you know, God has chosen that these different ones are called to be in different places and they're gifted in a certain way. I'm so thankful for brother Murphy and the voice that's going into China. You might say one person. Oh, I tell you what, there is there is uh there's response every single week from the internet of people that are hearing the message and receiving the message and several churches have already been established as you know, but we're so thankful for that. And brother Timothy in Vietnam and what has been taking place there. Brother Ernie Bill Noea now in the Philippines. We just said it in passing, but over 3,000 ministers, denominational ministers have now been confronted with the message in just the Philippines. and 250 of them, just give or take a few, have been rebaptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and have returned to their congregations and rebaptized as many as would be rebaptized. You say, "Well, uh, it's not going to be great numbers." That's exactly right. But all that effort may be made for one or two, and one is worth 10,000 worlds. Isn't it worth one man going over? Isn't it worth having uh mystery expose or having uh conventions or whatever it takes? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're thankful for that. And so we are we're just happy to be part of this great work. Uh we have an announcement also we would like to make and that is that brother Dalton Harp and sister Teresa Harp and Michael Anderson especially Michael Anderson is happy to make the announcement of their the engagement of Michael Anderson to Alicia Harp and God bless brother Michael to Alicia. And we would ask that uh these young people, we need to really pray for them. I see some, you know, get married and and uh that that's when a lot of, you know, a lot of hardships come, but we're we're we're we have been made to endure whatever hardships come our way. And marriage should be a blissful experience. Remember that, brother Mike. Citricia communion. We're going to have communion, the Lord's table and footwashing next Sunday. Next Sunday evening. And so we we arranged it so that the people in Seattle, Tacoma, and and and in that region can be here because they have a service today. They wouldn't be able to be here tonight. So, they're going to be here uh Lord willing, next Sunday. and we'll have a marvelous time. Brother John Andy's is going to bring us a word that will lead us into the service. I will be here of course. Uh but tonight we're having a baptismal after the service. Brother Tom Ray will be ministering tonight and then we're having a baptismal. There's several that are going to be baptized and we're so thankful for each one. God moves on and uh go to the water and be buried. So, we'll be having a burial tonight and a resurrection &gt;&gt; because we're not going to leave them in the water. They're gonna they're going to come up. Hallelujah. To newness of life. Amen. Uh I want to make sure I don't forget anything. Uh now before we are going to come to the word, I'm just taking a little bit of time this morning. Uh uh we visited uh brother Eddie Childers and Sister Jackie yesterday. Uh we we've been praying and there's been a couple times that they had prayer in the church for brother Eddie who was in the hospital. Well, the thing was he was out of the hospital, but by the time you could almost get the prayer request, he was back in and he was back out. Uh I want to just say a word and you can also be preparing yourself. I'm going to do something a little different this morning. I'm I want to and I feel led to take an offering up for brother Eddie, Sister Jackie Chillers. And you can just be praying about that. Brother Eddie has been on a intervenous for 22 years. 22 years. He has to have the intervenous in his body every night. This last week, one week ago, was the first time in 22 years that he was without an intervenous. And that came as a result of a h of going right, you know, sometimes God allow you to go right to the very limit. And I got a call from his son-in-law, Brother Andy Cox. Actually, called Brother Tom. And they called me right away. And brother Eddie was in the hospital and they could not find a place. He's had the intervenous in him. So over 22 years, they couldn't find a place to insert the uh the unit that needs to have the intervenous permanently in his body and it wouldn't work. And they had no way and didn't look like he could live. It come right down. Sister Jackie, I spoke with her then and she said, "He's been a good man. He's been a good father. He's been a good husband." Sister Jackie, you you don't know it as a congregation, but I prayed. I flew to Ohio and prayed for Brother Eddie Chillers when he was just a young man. He was all ballooned and swelled out. He was laying on a hospital bed in his house. He was just a young man. And I walked into that room and it didn't seem like there was any way for this young man to live. And I was there to pray for him. And really, I can tell you that there was no great mountain of faith in my heart. I just I was one perhaps of many, many that prayed for brother Eddie. Little did I ever realize that he and his wife and his family would be in our church 25 years later. and sister Jackie's mother, our sister Ellen Whitten, who's sitting here today, and we're so happy that she's here. But this brother has suffered incredibly. We don't question God, and we don't know why, but he came right to the very limits and the doctors could not find a place and that would be the end of the road for him. And they need and his body was ravaged with infection. So they were trying to taking several multiple kinds of of of medication every day and now he had an infection. and they couldn't they couldn't overcome this infection and somehow God intervened and uh and a a Jewish doctor by the name of Levenson came in and he said to him something about Abraham and he said you got he said to Eddie he said you got to get rid of your gods. Brother Eddie doesn't know what he's talking about. And he pointed to the intervenous poll and he says this, you got to get rid of these gods. You're depending on that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it really spoke to his heart and and they couldn't really do it medically. So, uh anyway, he went home. They sent him home and uh and and and now he doesn't have the intervenous. He can't depend on this god. So he goes without it. And his body has been responding. This is the last this last week he's been one week without the intervenous &gt;&gt; and we want to pray for him. They're they're just depending. They're doing everything. Now let me tell you, Sister Jackie Childers, I have such you don't mind me taking a few moments. I have such respect for her. She learned because of this condition of her husband, she took up nursing and become a full-fledged nurse just to treat her husband. Now that's a wife. That's a real wife. And she's devoted herself. And the reason I want to take an offering right now is because she's not even working. She just has quit working because she feels that she needs to spend her entire time and just devoting everything. She's trying to find every little way to for him to get the nutrient because because he's had multi he's had so many operations. I couldn't even count them. Said operation after operation and they kept removing of the intestine and he only has just a short little piece of intestine. So the food that goes to into his body hasn't got time to give him the nutrients into his system. And that is that's the way he's lived all these years. And so he's trusted intervenous. Now the intervenous isn't there. And we're trusting God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said however God chooses to do it. We're we're we're just happy. I want to sing. God's already provided. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the deacons come. Let us give out of our hearts of compassion to our brother and sister and their and their their need at this time. God knows their need. Hallelujah. If we all just do a little bit, it'll be sufficient. You give as the Lord leads you. He's already droed. [Music] every proise you can claim. Just asking if Jesus name everything you need. He's alreadyed once again. He's already provided. He's already provided. [Music] Everything you need is already provided. Every promise you can claim just ask it in Jesus name. Everything you need. He's already provided. Just once more now. He's already &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You've provided already. [Music] Oh, everything in me, he's already proided. Every pro you can claim just ask it in Jesus name. Everything you need. He's already provided. [Music] Hallelujah. We're also thankful that God has provided wonderfully for many of the believers in Granada. They've all lost their homes. Many about 15 homes and men of vision have taken it upon themselves and the brothers that are working. Our brother Randy Snow is here from Phoenix today. and brother Randy and brother Rod Bergen, brother Kenard. Brother Kennardil is in Trinidad this morning with brother Vin and because there's a there's at least two contractors that are prepared to go over and through brother Randy has knows uh the CEO of Swift Transport who has over a thousand trucks in Phoenix and they have donated some containers and uh some other uh building supply companies are giving their lumber and everything. And they've got to write down to the stick, every 2x4 and where it goes and how many this house needs, how many that needs. They want now to build 15. These are not homes like we have here. These are like 16x 20, maybe 16 by 24 buildings, just frame buildings. And and and then these brothers are willing to go over and to organize and to oversee it. And brother Ken is on his way to Granada tomorrow morning, I believe, with brother Vin. And but we're working beyond the uh pastors and churches, if you understand, because sometimes, you know, it's natural for a pastor to want to see his own people benefited, but we're working outside of that. We're we're working with all of those that are in need, and we just want to have those things done. We thank those here who have given. And I have personally a very great interest in seeing men of vision. They they don't communicate really what they do and God bless them for being humble but sometimes you have to tell what is happening. And so do pray for them because there's a there's a if you haven't heard about 50% of the nutmeg which is per which is in the world comes from Granada. their entire fields are gone. It looks like it's been bombed. They said it'll be many years before the farmers and the people who make their living. That's one of the only industries they have is growing nutmeg. And it'll be years before those farms can be back up because the trees are gone, the bushes are gone, everything's gone. Looks like it's been total total devastation. Looks like a war zone and they don't even know how they're going to live. So the first thing is important that we help them believers. We're we are helping believers and I think we ought to the least we can do is pray and to do all that we can that these brothers are able to fulfill the purpose and and once it gets there there's that they they don't even know because there's no infrastructure to get it to the different locations. And so pray that we'll have that the brothers will find the right people who will have the who will have the burden on their heart to make certain that these materials get and are used for the purpose that they're given. Will you do that with us? Amen. God bless you and God bless you, brother Randy. We'll not forget what it is you brothers are doing. mind standing now? We're going to be reading from the Bible. But before we turn to the Bible, I realize I'm being rather lengthy this morning. I I held this book up, this little book, Understanding the Old Testament, by some Hebrew scholars. I thought we could get 250 to 300 of them. We can only get 150. So, anyone who wants one, uh, you want to get your name into the office. After 150, we don't have any more available. And these are just on their way. This is what I'm so thankful how we have been instructed by a prophet of God. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; And he has even instructed us as to which Bible we should read. And listen what these listen what these scholars have said about the King James version of the Bible. In quoting the Bible that throughout this book in quoting the Bible we intentionally used an old translation the King James version and not one of the modern translations whose language is more attuned to modern times. The translation was completed at the beginning of the 17th century in the days of William Shakes Shakespeare by a group of scholars from among his circle. Its archaic language is in harmony with the Hebrew Bible both in its majesty and in its simplicity. There is no other translation that preserves the flavor of the Hebrew Bible better than this one. Of the King James version, one is tempted to speculate that had the Bible originally been in English, this is the way it would have been written. &gt;&gt; Ain't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; And here we have a prophet &gt;&gt; come and say, "That's the Bible to read. Hallelujah. That's the Bible to read. Hallelujah. And you're all holding it this morning. If it' been written in English, you got it right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to turn to Luke's Gospel, the 14th chapter. But before we read, we're going to pray. Heavenly Father, we've taken time feeling so at home with the family of God and the internet congregation, Lord, that is also gathered listening from home to home and place to place from country to country, wherever they are at this moment. and the letters that I've received Lord even just this last week so encouraging how the people are so appreciative of the streaming the uh and being enabling them to be joining with us and I pray that the holy presence of the holy God the God of Israel the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who sent him as a sacrifice for our sins s and hung there and paid the full debt upon the cross. And today we stand justified, sanctified, and glorified in your presence. We thank you, Lord, for the great things that you are doing. Bless all the brethren, Lord, that have gone out from the congregation and are engaged in one way or another. Bless this congregation, Lord, and all who are who are your witnesses. I pray that they will be witnesses by the power of the Holy Spirit. Instruct us this morning. Guide us, oh God. We pray. I ask that you'll bless every minister, Lord. And I pray, Father, that you'll bless, Lord Jesus, the the endeavor of the word this morning by the Holy Spirit. Man can do nothing, Lord. We are the arm of flesh will fail us, but the arm of Christ, our almighty God will never fail. We pray father that you will anoint by the holy spirit both hearers and the speaker in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I want to read from Luke 14 starting with verse 16 about 10 verses. Then said he unto them, "A certain man made a great supper, and bade many, and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, come, for all things are ready." If you'll notice, he sent his servant, singular, at supper time, which is evening time, to say to them that were bidden, "Come, for all things are now ready." And they all with one consent began to make an ex began to make excuse. The first one said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground and I must need to go and see it. I pray thee have me excused. And another said, I have bought five yolk of oxen, and I go to prove them. I pray thee, have me excused. And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. So that servant came and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, "Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind." And the Lord and the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded. And yet there is room. And the Lord said unto the servant, "Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in that my house may be filled. For I say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper." And there went a great multitude with him. And he turned and said unto them, "If any man come after me, come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters, yay, in his own life also he cannot be my disciple. And who do whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple." Amen. God bless his word to our hearts. as you have your seats. I'd like to speak on a rather strange subject and I wrestled with the title because I wanted to call it something else but I had difficulty so I'm just staying with it. It's not doesn't sound very spiritual, but it's entitled the making of an excuse. Brother Brandham says about our enemy, Satan. And it's good that we know his tactics. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He speaks about a boxer. He said, "If you're a boxer, you study your opponent. You study his licks. You study how he moves." and they they watch them very very carefully and they train according to that so they can they know what their opponent is about to do. Sometimes I think we get we get a a knock on the side of the head sometime because we haven't really paid attention to our opponent's tactics. That's the purpose one of the purposes this morning. It will not be a negative message but it is that we might understand his tactics. And some of the things I'm speaking is from my own uh my own experience of the things that I've seen over the years. Now this great supper there is the supper, the invitation and the excuse. Those three things which we hope to kind of cover. The supper according to uh the encyclopedia is the last meal of the day or an evening banquet. That is the supper. And uh the the scripture says it's a great supper. Uh now the supper which we are speaking of and participating in is a people that have been invited to feed on the body word of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are feeding even now as we hear things that you wouldn't hear elsewhere. And I was so conscious of this even on this last little trip as we spoke to different ones whether it was in Israel or whether it was in Greece or whether it was in Turkey and we would just throw out little tidbits of things from the message. Uh the it was evident on the people's face in their eyes. They've never heard such things. And you can tell right away. And here we are freely feeding, freely invited to a a a banquet, an evening banquet. And I must say that we should be and never cease to be so thankful for the things that we're able to feed on and participate in. And the great supper uh is a is a word that being great is a word that you're quite familiar with. We use it all the time, mega. And it's a in the Greek it's megas. Uh but it is to be splendid prepared on a grand scale. &gt;&gt; You can't appreciate something unless you understand really what has taken place. &gt;&gt; You know, it's a it's a it's a concern. I have a concern lest we uh just take take it for granted. Oh, I'll just go to service. I'll just, you know, I'll just sit and read a message book. But when we pick it up, you know, when you take it in your hand, I've traveled a lot and when I take up a book, I have such an appreciation realizing that there is just tens of millions of people and there's a lot of people who wish they could go to the cabinet or wish they could go to a shelf and pick one up, but I haven't got it. That's what drives me on, drives us on to do everything that we can to discharge our responsibility to see that people will have and feed on the same thing we're feeding on. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, it's a mega supper. It's a mega uh banquet. It's an evening meal. It's a splendid uh banquet on a great scale, a stately banquet. And it says further these are uh things that are uh God's preeminent blessings and furthermore of things which overstep it and I'm going to give you it exactly the way it is in the encyclopedia overstep called the province of of man or province of a created being and province we live in a province Canada you United States has states and we have provinces A province is it's it's it simply means it's an old English term which is bounded by certain boundaries. This is a a certain sphere. We have a boundary between British Columbia and Alberta and north between the Yukon and and British Columbia and the ocean on this side and the United States on that side. And this is the province and the laws of this province this sphere do not exceed those boundaries. &gt;&gt; That is the sphere. It could be of the province of a judge and that judge will have a certain judicial responsibility and his sphere of authority cannot exceed the province of his uh of of his sphere. It cannot go beyond that. He has no jurisdiction beyond his his uh responsibility or the area the sphere of his of his charge. That's the full limit. But this says now mega in the Greek is that a a great supper. This is something that is beyond the sphere of human created being &gt;&gt; and this meal that we have has come to us announced when you have tapes that you can hear it. Oh, that's just a tape. Now don't think that don't think that that is just something that we oh well we've had that for years. We've heard that for years. But but when you hear that prophet messenger and you hear the revealing of the secret of the heart, that is a mega supper. &gt;&gt; That individual is hearing things they've never heard before. They've never had a person come and tell them the very secret of their heart because that is now a a mega supper. It is reaching beyond the ability and the sphere of human knowledge and reaching beyond the ability of the human strength or the human uh ability and and that is what Mega he prepared a great supper. &gt;&gt; God has prepared this supper and has brought it to us on an announcement that this is not a man speaking. This is not just a man's knowledge. This is not a man's idea of what's in this book. This is God's knowledge coming through a human vessel and showing that it's beyond the sphere of created being. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You understand what I'm saying? And this has been the the the supper now is not merely some doctrine or some new thing that's been said or some church that just thinks uh a little differently than the other church on the corner. If that's all we are, we should shut the doors and go home. This is a great supper that we've been invited to that we are participating in. And we need to know what kind of a meal that God has prepared for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the invitation, the invitation, you might have said, "Well, I heard I heard about the message a certain way. I was uh I was a God spoke to me and dealt with me a certain way, but let me just go back. Let me just go back a wee bit. I only go back just within this generation. This gospel did not come to us down easy street. This gospel did not come to us on a golden platter. &gt;&gt; God turned, he took his servant and took our precious brother Brandham. And I tell you, many people have had have uh difficulty in their lives, have had sorrows in their lives. But God took because he had to be a vessel. That would be that through whom he would reveal the son of man was Jesus Christ. And Jesus Christ was the grain, the sheath that came up out of the earth, was ground into the sorrows of humanity until he became the fine flour that could be baked and produce the bread of life and a vessel that God would use to to reveal the son of man in the end time was not one who could come out of the flowery uh schools of of of high education or some seminary or through some life of ease. He had to come out of poverty. He had to come out of reproach. He had to come so he could be misunderstood. He had to live with that kind of a life. You understand? He could not come the way maybe you and I come. And then he had to have this thing within him that he could not understand. this mysterious, this mystic thing is always reaching out trying to understand, trying to understand what is this? What is this voice? What is this thing that I feel? Why am I so strange? Why am I so odd? Why am I so different? And live year after year after year, not understanding why am I this way? Telling his wife, I got to go. I'm going to go into a cave. I'm going to go into the wilderness. I won't be back till I understand it. And if I don't understand it, I won't come back. I've just got to find out. I'm I you know thinking that are we losing our senses? Are we losing our our our mental capacity? You understand that God was preparing he was writing his invitation. &gt;&gt; It wasn't coming easy. &gt;&gt; The invitation didn't come on easy street friends. The thing that you have heard didn't come to you easy. It came by God grinding a grinding a human vessel down causing him sorrow and grief and and despair not knowing how his future would even be in taking his wife and taking his child one right after another such and such sadness and such sorrow. You say well a lot of people have lost it. Yes. But if you just read the whole life story and understand when I read life story, it's not just life story of a man, but it is a God preparing an invitation. &gt;&gt; And you have to understand the invitation in order to understand the excuse. &gt;&gt; You have to understand the invitation. You have to understand that God himself, Almighty God, I hope you can hear me good and I hope I can speak it clearly. But Almighty God out of his very bosom, he wanted to take the last generation, the people of the last age, and he's going to prepare them something special. Not just a supper, but a mega supper, a great supper. He's going to prepare them something that has been sealed &gt;&gt; through the generations, been sealed through the ages. And God sat back while people probed and presumed and tried to see and tried to understand and they studied and they spent late nights and early mornings and they went to different schools and education whatever more trying to get a grasp upon these mysteries and God's holding it back simply saying you're fine people maybe you're sincere it's not the time it's not the time but finally it came the Time to send that last messenger out of his right hand. Now I'm going to prepare a great supper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to reach beyond the province of man. &gt;&gt; I'm going to reach beyond the human ability. &gt;&gt; I'm going to reach beyond the human the human understanding. I'll simply take control of the mouth, bypass the mind, and speak the very word of God. Hallelujah. The lamb will take the book and the book will be tore open and I will speak the things that need to be made known before I bring the world to judgment. &gt;&gt; I will reinstate and restate the word the way it was spoken in the first place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; This supper was so great that would extend beyond the realm of human mind. It's confirmed by signs and wonders and miracles of all kinds. And that is why right in the end of the ministry, brother Brandon would make this statement. The son of man is Christ. The supper we're talking about is Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the one you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; He's the one who said, "Except you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no life in you." And that was the very statement that caused them to turn away. &gt;&gt; You'd think the very invitation, they didn't understand the invitation. And that was an invitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was saying to them, "Except you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no life in you." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "What do you think a doctor or a nurse thought of that kind of a statement?" He didn't explain it. &gt;&gt; He didn't explain the invitation, but that was an invitation. &gt;&gt; And they couldn't understand it. Because they didn't understand it, they turned it aside. But he said, "You're not feeding on a man. A man's words will fail." What's he talking about? Words that won't fail. But you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man. I say to this congregation today that is a across the whole spectrum of age right from young children to elder people. I say to this congregation as one that has walked this way for many many years and been with you for many many years. You will never regret serving God with every ounce of your strength. You'll never regret being faithful to Christ and to the house of God. You'll never regret it. &gt;&gt; You will never regret it. I'll stand before God with these words falling from my lips. You'll never regret it. The invitation, I refer to it as your invitation. an invitation of compassion, of loving kindness, of mercy, and of grace. The Apostle Paul said, "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose." The called is the invited, according to his purpose. Moreover, verse 30 of chapter 8, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called, them he also justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified. The Greek dagot says, "And those whom he pre predetermined, he also invited." He predetermined it and invited you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? God predetermined it. &gt;&gt; I don't know who's predetermined. God knows. &gt;&gt; But whoever he predetermined, he invited them. &gt;&gt; And whom he invited, those he also justified. You've been invited. So he justified you. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. &gt;&gt; He sent it on the wings of a snow white dove. &gt;&gt; The invitation. I'm talking about the invitation. &gt;&gt; When I read the life story or even reflect on the life story, I say God didn't just do that to brother Brandham. God did that to him for me. &gt;&gt; They say 68 million martyrs died. They preserved the word of God. They preserved the testimony. They wouldn't bow. They wouldn't ban. They wouldn't burn. &gt;&gt; They did it for you and I. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They held the testimony through the Old Testament for you and for me that we could have a true today. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ went every step that he went on your behalf and on my behalf. It's not just a record of a man of the son of God, Jesus Christ enduring what he endured, but every day it was for me and for you. &gt;&gt; That's all part of the invitation. It was sent because that was his purpose. Now Jesus is telling us in this parable in this account he's telling us of this great supper and it came in three stages. The message came in three pulls to those who for various reasons all made excuse. That was number one. Number two was to the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind. It was a great healing ministry. And the third was go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them &gt;&gt; to come in. &gt;&gt; I can assure you that in this last age, from my own personal testimony, I was compelled. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I was compelled in spite of no one else around me that was actually a believer at that time. We didn't have the support structure of the kind of congregation that you're able to sit in this morning. But I can tell you that God God's work in the individual life is so compelling that it is your circumstances around you become irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Say I don't have anybody beside me. So what? &gt;&gt; I don't have anybody to lean on. So what? My financial situation's not that good. So what? That has nothing to do with it. Has nothing to do with it. Has nothing to do with it. You understand what I'm saying? Be it becomes so compelling. You become so focused. You become fanatical. You become heretical. Call me what you will. Call me insane. Call me whatever you want to, but I must go this way. I'm compelled. &gt;&gt; This has been a compelling thing. This is not hoham, you know, maybe sort of thing. This is the direction that I must go. &gt;&gt; I'm headed for the kingdom &gt;&gt; and I can't stop. &gt;&gt; What if this happens? So what? That has nothing to do with it. You can have the greatest upheaval. You can have the greatest loss. You can have the greatest reversal. You can have the greatest sickness or disease. whatever it is, but I cannot change my course. I'm headed for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Nobody convinced us of this doctrine. God revealed it. &gt;&gt; If you became convinced because somebody was a good speaker, then perhaps you can get argued out of it. If you got argued into it, you can get argued out of it. But when God reveals it, nobody can argue out of it. It has become a part of you. You cannot escape it. It's been revealed to you. &gt;&gt; This is Jesus Christ, the son of man that I'm feeding upon. &gt;&gt; If it's just a support group of a church, you can be persuaded about something else that might be better for you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham actually ties Luke 14 to Matthew. We won't turn to it, but in Matthew, I believe chapter 22 down from verse 1 to4, it is those that were invited to a wedding. Don't forget the wedding is now. &gt;&gt; And if you don't come to the wedding, and they all had excuses, too. If you don't come to the wedding, certainly won't go to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; You're invited to a marriage. You're invited to be a participant of the union between yourself and Christ. And if you are not united to this Christ, this revealed Christ in this hour, how we expect to go to a wedding supper &gt;&gt; in message proving his word. says the bridegroom will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come into human flesh &gt;&gt; to unite the two together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; do you hear that? &gt;&gt; That is what we have seen. That's what we've lived. That is what has &gt;&gt; been part and parcel of our invitation. when the the bridegroom that's Christ will come through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together. Catch this please. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I said earlier said earlier that a great supper is something it's megas it's mega it extends beyond the province or the boundaries of human of created being. So a human vessel stands and God that part. Now there's a man born of a woman born in sin like everyone else shaped in iniquities had a seventh grade education. I want I need you to see this so you catch the rest of my message. and he stands there and uh some uh supernatural act of almighty God takes a vessel. So he scarcely knows what realm he's in, what world he's in, slips into another dimension back and forth. What is it? When he slips in another dimension, he's extended beyond the province of man. &gt;&gt; It's no longer man. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's God. &gt;&gt; That part is not man. That's God. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; It's God that's taking God beyond the province of man speaking. There's a woman down here. Uh the light is over her. What light? You can't see it. No one else sees it. Where is it? It's beyond the province of man. It's beyond these eyes. It's beyond these ears. doing that to catch the attention of the people so that they might be uh that they might be so impressed uh concerning the invitation &gt;&gt; that they're receiving beyond. And that's what you and I will give an account for &gt;&gt; because that's not man, that's God. &gt;&gt; Now it's God &gt;&gt; speaking through a prophet. in that that was the son of man come into human flesh to unite the two the son of man &gt;&gt; the bridegroom stepping down by spirit into human flesh &gt;&gt; which we call that a prophet &gt;&gt; so that through that prophet you will hear the word that goes beyond the province of man beyond his seventh grade education had nothing to do with it by past it. So you go out, catch and smite the heart of the people and speak a word out of the scripture. Say, "I never saw that before." What is it? It's God going beyond the province of man. Oh my people. Do you hear what I'm saying this morning? And it is that part that God was anchoring and catching the heart of the people to draw them into this invitation. &gt;&gt; To unite you &gt;&gt; to the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To unite you to the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; You followed me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you followed me thus far? &gt;&gt; You understand it? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what people got confused about. So, well, I know that's God. That's correct. And I know that this is man. That's correct. &gt;&gt; He did that to unite you to that very God who's the bridegroom, who is the son of man, who's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. He did that so they could clearly uh not merely emphasize but clearly set out the pattern the program that that is what he's designed for you. It's God not just anointing people now but God want to dwell in the individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. to unite the two together. The church has to be the word and he is the word and the two unites together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man. Not a clergyman, not a clergyman. Regardless of how well a minister might speak, that won't do it. &gt;&gt; This isn't some cunning thing. He said, "See, it's the son of man, Jesus Christ, will come down in human flesh among us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And will make his word so real &gt;&gt; that it will unite. What will you what will make it unite? The word that becomes so real. &gt;&gt; It will unite the church and him in one, &gt;&gt; the bride. And then she'll go home to the wedding supper. Then she'll go home to the wedding supper. This is the evening supper we're having. But we're going to a wedding supper, he said. And she's already united. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We go to the wedding supper. Not to the marriage, but the rapture is going to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. I want to move along quickly. I want to move on to the the excuse. And this has been really what the message is about. An excuse is something that is intended to declare one free from blame. That's what an excuse is. Or try to remove the blame. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something a statement or it's a position that is taken to give just reason for making a certain decision. An excuse is to release one from from responsibility or to release one from service or obligation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't want to become obligated. They want to become engaged in the in this responsibility of this service. Now I want to be very careful here. There are times in life when circumstances justify us to make a certain decision. They do justify us. We need to make a certain decision. And uh and so we have we we take action based on a certain scenario of circumstances and we do that in life. But that's not what I'm speaking of and that's not what I'm dealing with. I want to deal with another aspect and that is the aspect that Jesus spoke of here. The excuses here that are recorded have to do only with the great supper. Now I've laid I've made and and I've labored for the first part of the service on the supper, the greatness of the supper and what is in the bosom of God and then to prepare a messenger to give the invitation and to extend it to a generation. Some heard it and saw it visibly and others you've only heard it by eyewitnesses such as you as a congregation have. But then then we have responded to this invitation. But in life now in this particular scripture it is largely to do they they they didn't they had reason not to accept the invitation to the supper. But there's something that is more subtle and something that is more of a concern to me. And that is that those that have accepted the word, they've accepted Christ, they started on their journey, but as time goes on, there are changes in their life. There are changes because time and life itself bring changes to us. And as we move along, I see, and here's the crux of my message. I'm going to just bring it forward and then hopefully fill in some of the spaces. I see, and I have a quote here where brother Brandham says that Satan, he just stands and he waits. The David in the Psalms said how his enemy laid in weight for him. &gt;&gt; Laid in weight. And I I I see how Satan, he he will lay a long he's patient. A serpent will wait a long time for his prey. He'll just lay he'll uh he'll hide himself. He'll conceal himself right by the pathway where a person goes every day. Every day goes to their food, goes to do their duties and so on. He'll wait there for the right opportune time to make his strike. And I have seen how that Satan knows well perhaps they h how our circumstances change. Maybe when you were young and fervent and uninvolved and some of our young people here, you you're not encumbered. You're not lassued down. you you don't have responsibilities of marriage and of children and of of debts and and all of these things. You if you have a credit card, it's not yours. Perhaps it's your parents. You don't have those kind of responsibilities. You're not you're not concerned about how to put food on the table tomorrow or how to pay the rent next month. You just go home. That's mom and dad's responsibility. You're you're free of those kind of responsibilities. But as time goes on, life changes things. And then you assume more responsibilities and you go through the glitz and the glamour of of a courtship and perhaps a marriage and then you have some responsibilities and people maybe handle that very very well. Then children come into the world are born into the family and and perhaps that even isn't too upsetting but you know it's a happy time and you got the children around you and all the rest of then the children start getting up into their teens and maybe become young men and young women and it's it's not really realistic to believe that there isn't some disappointments along the way. There are some scary moments when you see that young person and being pulled perhaps by the world, being pulled by some friends and oh, you're so desirous that that that God will intervene &gt;&gt; and but but as time goes on and you may see you may have a reversal in in your health. You're strong, you're robust, your strength is is is with you. Maybe your beauty is with you as a young individual, but as time goes on, life takes its toll and perhaps you engage in things that begin to uh uh really start to destroy all that beauty of youth. There's a lot of people that haven't even reached 25 and they're already old men and old women and their drugs and their lifestyle and everything else has taken a terrible toll on them. And Satan is full of glee that he's been able to deceive them and send them down such a terrible trail. &gt;&gt; But as time goes on, Satan is laying weight and and something that seems so simple at the beginning finally formulates into an excuse. Oh, well, because this happened or because I had this disappointment or because of the wife that I married or because of the husband that I married or because of he's doing this or she's doing that or they're not doing this or they're not doing that. And for this reason, I I I'm just disappointed in my experience with God. I'm I'm disappointed in the message. And it may even be undeclared, but but we we we declare it in our actions and we slack off and we slack back and the ferveny dissipates and we're not the same as we used to be. And we have an excuse. Because of this, I can't be the kind of believer I used to be. Because of this, I can't be as faithful as I used to be. Because of this, the fire doesn't burn like it used to burn. I say it's a weak, frail excuse. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it won't work. &gt;&gt; And Satan laid in weight to prepare that excuse for you so that you could so that he could deprive you of the fullness of the supper. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to receive the full strength of the supper. If you eat this whole body word of the Son of Man, you're going to do destruction for him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is interested in men and women that'll be full of fire, full of ferveny, full of zeal, full of desire, that will not be deterred, that can't be watered down, that cannot be uh uh made lax and laxidasical anymore. &gt;&gt; You think I'm preaching this because I want to. I'm preaching it because it's truth because of what I've seen. &gt;&gt; It's Satan. wants to rob you. &gt;&gt; I say there are churches that Satan has robbed them. They only have one service a week. I think it's a shame. &gt;&gt; We ought to be at the door at least three times a week. Ready for the house of God, ready to sing, ready to have input and say, "I'm important in this place. I'm a member of the body of Christ [Applause] &gt;&gt; and I cannot let this standard down. How Satan will pound on it. How he will try to persuade, how he'll try to penetrate the mind and reason it this way and that. Oh, because this happened, that happened, the other thing happened that we have to uh uh uh mullify or or dilute the message which we hold. We can't do it. We can't do it. They all with one consent began to make excuse. I bought a piece of ground. I bought five yolk of oxen. I've married a wife. What do you think I should do as a minister? I'm asking you, what do you think I should do as a minister? I I've seen young men, young women come in and they sit in the front seat like you fellas here. Don't you change, Michael. I'm putting you on notice here. Now, you'll remember this message is the one we announced. Oh, they're just they're all fervent for God. Then they get married. They get married. They go back in the congregation. Then they have babies, so they sit way at the back so they can slip out. I understand all of that. And then they're not there on Wednesday. Do I need you in church? No, I don't need you in church, but you need to. &gt;&gt; Then they're not there Wednesday. They're Sunday morning and Sunday night. And then they're not there Sunday night. And then well the situation I got a family and it's important I get out and you know have a little time off. So we have a Sunday and we kind of went out for a little picnic and so picnic all you want but not when God's people are gathered in their house. &gt;&gt; You'll be glad when this service is over. Shall I preach it? &gt;&gt; And some they married a wife and then they they they they're history. &gt;&gt; They're gone. I even asked one brother. I said, "Before you were married, you were sitting on the front row every service." &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you got married and I don't even see you anymore. Not you, not your wife, not your kids. What happened? How am I supposed to say it was a good thing? &gt;&gt; Was it a good thing? Well, then she could say, "Well, he didn't take the headship." You know, both of them need to take full responsibility and just stop making excuses. I'm tired of excuses. God's tired of excuses. And in fact is he speaks of in the scripture where they will be without excuse. &gt;&gt; You know, we've all engaged in excuses. &gt;&gt; We've all engaged in them. You know, you've had the telephone call and then over the mouthpiece goes, you know, they they want us over tonight. They want us for supper. They, you know, they want something. You have to go someplace right away. Just tell them I'm just leaving now. Brother Brandon did it. &gt;&gt; A phone call came and he stepped out the back door. Tell him I'm not in. had to repent over that &gt;&gt; because he wasn't in but yet he was him. &gt;&gt; We engage in that. This is an age when excuses a part of our life. &gt;&gt; We just make them all the time. They're second nature to us. I'm preaching this morning so that you will take a real caution. It doesn't work in the kingdom of God. It might work in life, but it won't work in the kingdom of God. It doesn't work. I am the way I am. I am I'm at my spiritual level because of him or because of her or because of this deacon or because somebody tells I'm not there anymore because I saw that sister. She doesn't dress just right. Well, you ought to come and dress right and be a testimony. [Applause] That person doesn't just sing right. Well, you sing right. &gt;&gt; You give the testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Someone they're not just, you know, they're not up where they ought to be. Well, you come and be higher and pull them up. &gt;&gt; Be stronger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One, one excuse won't work. I've heard all kinds of excuses. I've heard the whole gamut. I I I didn't even write them down because, you know, uh it's too broad. Paul said in Romans, he said, "Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them. For God has showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead, so that they are without excuse. It must be a terrible thing to be without excuse. Don't know if you remember, brother Dan Dasley stood here once. He told me little account. He said the pastor uh ran into a brother that he missed in church on the street. So he said, "Uh, you weren't in church on Sunday." He said, 'Yeah, I ran out of peanut butter. &gt;&gt; He says, "What's peanut butter got to do with going to church?" He says, "Nothing." But he said, "It's as good as any other excuse." &gt;&gt; I ran out of peanut butter. I never forgot that. Some of the excuses are just that weak. &gt;&gt; You might as well use that as as Annie. Here's something in the message all things in Shreport 62. Brother Brandham says, "Oh, you say I went down there and there's a lot of power, brother. The whole floor was dancing in the spirit and not enough faith to heal a toothache. You You call that power? That's not power. That's blessings. &gt;&gt; And see, there's a big difference between blessings and power &gt;&gt; and blessings and his presence. He said there's a lot of difference between blessings and power. &gt;&gt; God makes his blessings makes his blessings upon the righteous and the unrighteous. Why did I say that? because as time has gone on, maybe a family and and uh I'd like to show you some of the places that I've lived and the simplicity of it uh and what you're able to manage to live with and live without. But as time goes on, you know, and and then you accumulate. As time goes on, families, I'm talking about excuses, they accumulate things. Maybe accumulate burdens. &gt;&gt; I'm not even talking about material things. accumulate burdens, accumulate disappointments, accumulate upheavalss in relationships and you you gather a lot of baggage and they start to have an effect. they start to have an effect and then a person doesn't have the same focus, doesn't have the same desire. Maybe deep down has a desire but doesn't seem to manifest. Do you know what? We all have those things. We all have reversals. Some are known, some are seen, some are not seen. We all have those things of one kind or another. In other words, let me say this. Every person here would have a a a an excuse for not obtaining the full measure of the supper. &gt;&gt; Everybody has an excuse. &gt;&gt; If we want to focus on that excuse, &gt;&gt; people talk to me about their troubles. If they knew the troubles that I have borne &gt;&gt; and I I it is it it is absolutely you know without substance it's without substance and there is I will say there is no excuse that God will accept &gt;&gt; for us to to uh to fail &gt;&gt; to reach out to obtain the full if God's holding it out for us &gt;&gt; and for what some reason we have some justifiable reason for not receiving that that means that all of preparation everything that God has done he's he's being rebuffed &gt;&gt; he's being rebuffed he's being set aside the invitation set aside, the provision is set aside. You follow me? &gt;&gt; And so sometimes there are things I' I've spoke about reversals, but let's just talk about blessings now. And brother Brandham talks about uh the blessings and God makes blessings fall upon the righteous and the unrighteous. That's why Jesus said, I believe that's why he said it to Peter at the last chapter, I believe, of of John's gospel. When they caught all this multitude of fish, it was right after he was completely dis disappointed and discouraged with what was happening in the message of that hour. And Jesus allows them to prosper by catching the biggest amount of fish they ever caught. And then he says these words, "Lovest thou me more than these?" &gt;&gt; He's a fisherman. &gt;&gt; He knows what this net is worth. &gt;&gt; 153 great fish. This is This is like having a finding the mother load. &gt;&gt; Do you love me more than this prosperity? You know that I love you more. He asked him three times. Then feed my sheep. Feed my lambs. Feed my sheep. He wanted to keep them focused. I have a quote that I I want to and I have a scripture I want to read. Satan will use and these are as I felt directed. Satan will use every tactic and every device or circumstance be it good or bad to impede the individual's life or to turn the individual aside those I want you to get this now if there is a remote possibility whole congregation listen if there's something within the individual that will be appealed to or can possibly be appealed to. Satan will wait his opportunity until that moment has arrived. If it's possible for business to take you, if it's possible for pleasure to take you, if it's possible for the lust of the flesh to take a person, if it's possible for discouragement, if it's possible for uh a sickness or disease to take a person, if it's possible for any of this realm that is within his scope, within his domain, he will wait his opportunity till things have formulated, until things have come to that state and so that he can make his strike. You understand? Are you following me? Good. If it happens to be there, he will wait until the circumstances are such so that he can make his strike, make his pitch, and give you a a substantial justifiable excuse for not really obtaining the fullness of this supper. &gt;&gt; Something will happen. Something will come along. I've I've seen it. I've experienced it. Had lots of reasons at different times in my life to say, "Well, I guess I'll take the easy route. Go the easy road." But on the other hand, if that is not present within the individual that there is nothing like they say in the world and I hope you don't misunderstand me. Come hell or high water, &gt;&gt; nothing can deter me. Come disease, come sickness, come whatever it might be. Come discouragement, come loss of friends, come loss of family, come loss of whatever, by life or by death, whatever happens, nothing can change the course that I'm on. &gt;&gt; And if that is the resolve within the individual, then nothing that the enemy can bring your way can have an effect. And I want to say today as one believer, I'm beyond I by I say by faith, I'm beyond that point. &gt;&gt; And you want to make that confession, I'm beyond that point. &gt;&gt; Listen, my brother, my sister, the kingdom, we're going to step across it very, very soon. We don't know how soon, but you're going to never regret. You heard this message. &gt;&gt; You're going to never regret that you settled it then. There's not a there's not a thing. There's not a circumstance. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can happen that can change my mind or turn me around or soften my resolve. I am resolved. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can change it. &gt;&gt; I will not be silent. I will keep my testimony. I will hold my integrity before God. And oh, we'll say, we'll say with Job of old, though he slay me, yet I'll trust him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, I lost my family. Yes, I lost my possessions. Yes, I lost my friends. And now they've turned against me. And these comforters are miserable comforters. You all, &gt;&gt; have you had some miserable comforters? &gt;&gt; I've had them. You'll have them. &gt;&gt; If you haven't had them already, you'll have them. If you had family, friends, dear ones, David said, "If it had been his enemy that lifted up his heel, but it was them of his own household, &gt;&gt; have his own household lift up their heel against them." Your own family, your loved ones, maybe a husband or a wife or whatever it is, but nothing must water down the resolve within the individual. And I'm telling you that because Satan will be rendered helpless this morning. &gt;&gt; If you're here just on some wave, some emotional wave, that will certainly crash and and come to an end sometime. &gt;&gt; But when you have that resolve from the almighty God, I know in whom I have believeth. Hallelujah. And he is able to do all that he has promised to do. &gt;&gt; Scripture says he found them in a desert. God's describing his people. &gt;&gt; He's describing his people that he sent a prepared messenger Moses to. And he ground Moses out for 40 years to make him a vessel that would be ready to come to his people with the right kind of word and come before Pharaoh and say whatever he need to say. Let my people go &gt;&gt; and tell his people tell the children the Hebrew people who this God was. And he spoke to me in a pillar of fire in a burning bush. &gt;&gt; And he gave them this message. He found him. He found you, Israel. He found him. He found us in a desert land. &gt;&gt; Do you remember where you were when he found you? &gt;&gt; In some desolate, dark, dismal place in a in a waste, howling wilderness. What about that church, that denomination that you were in &gt;&gt; or when you were maybe even born into a Christian family, but without God in a waste howling wilderness? And he led him about. He instructed him. He kept him as the apple of his eye. Think about it. Found you in a waste wilderness. But he kept his eye upon you. Kept you as the apple of his eye. Wouldn't let you outside of his sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you thankful? Amen. &gt;&gt; You're out there wandering around in some dismal, dark, confused place and your father who's given going to give you an invitation wouldn't let you out of his eyesight. He kept you like the apple of his eye. &gt;&gt; As that eagle stirth her nest, flutterth over her young, spreadth forth her wings, taketh them, and beareth them up on wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Lord alone did lead him &gt;&gt; and there was no strange God with him &gt;&gt; and he made him to ride on high places. Oh, he just experienced that glory of that new birth and that and he and he discovered who he was and he's riding on mama's eagle wings. You remember when you first came in didn't seem like there was anything that could bother you? People could slander you and you just smile. Oh, you go on down the road and maybe they don't even just look at a person, right? And suddenly, you know, &gt;&gt; could sour a person up. That's because we got old and fidgety. &gt;&gt; But when we were young, it didn't bother us. Didn't bother us at all. We didn't have We just had pure thoughts about one another. Oh, you couldn't offend them for nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he rode on high places of the earth. And he might eat the increase of the fields. And oh how he fed. And he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock. Oh, it was such a wonderful marvelous life. And we ate butter of kind and milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of Bashon and goats and of the fat of kidneys and of wheat. And thou did drink the pure blood of the grape. But Jester after time waxed. Jester is God's people. God's people. Not somebody out there. God's people. They waxed fat. When they wax fat, it's a strange strange adjective that comes right with it. And they kicked. It's too cold in the church. What's the matter with those custodians? I don't like the color. Look what they put up there. What's that for? &gt;&gt; Come on. and they kicked. &gt;&gt; I don't like the I don't like the voice of the messenger who invites. I can't can't even hear it. Can't understand it. And they kicked. It goes together. And then God speaks. You're waxing fat. You've grown thick. They are covered with fatness. Then comes another act of another action tragic. Then he forsook God. In other words, then he drew back and he lightly esteemed. He didn't speak evil, but he lightly esteemed the God of his salvation. &gt;&gt; We just don't need the same don't need the same ferveny. Don't need You say, "Are you speaking about coming to church?" No, I'm not. But I have noticed those that don't come, we could have had we could have had people say even when Paul was here, well, I don't have to go and hear him. I I I get I God can speak to me at home. &gt;&gt; Have you heard that? &gt;&gt; God can speak to me at home. It doesn't say that thou I will speak to you at home. It says that the more so you gather yourself together as you see the day approaching. Some will say, "Oh, I see the day approaching. What are you doing at home then?" &gt;&gt; Am I too straight? &gt;&gt; No, I'm here. Why are you here? Cuz I'm a I'm a part. I'm a finger. I'm a muscle. I'm a I'm a cord. I'm something. I'm something in the kingdom. How do you know? Well, I got a voice. I praise him &gt;&gt; when I sing. My neighbor hears my voice because I'm singing with everything that's in me. &gt;&gt; And if somebody says you're off tune, just say, "Don't kick." &gt;&gt; I'm doing my best. &gt;&gt; I'm making a loud noise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But if you can be deterred by a by an excuse, I tell you, Satan will engineer one for you. He'll sure see that there's one. But if you're beyond that, I'm beyond offense. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm beyond being turned aside. I'm beyond being distracted. I'm headed for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've responded to the invitation and I'm eating this last supper meal. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go for this. You know, when you have a good meal, somehow it wears off real fast and you're ready for the next one. Well, I've been eating this for about 30ome years and I'm ready for the next one. &gt;&gt; The wedding supper. The wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. and how our prophet describes it. &gt;&gt; He says thousands of miles long. &gt;&gt; He says we'll sit across from one another &gt;&gt; and tears of joy will roll down our faces. Oh friends, &gt;&gt; what will everything that you're enduring or going through now mean? &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; And the king will come in. &gt;&gt; He'll say these words, "It's over, children." &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to hear those words. It's over, children. It's over. and come start to dry our eyes. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; There isn't an excuse in the world. There isn't an excuse that the cunningness of Satan can devise that worth. If he wants to wait my entire lifetime to bring an excuse at the end, he might as well lay in the grass and rot because he cannot deter me. &gt;&gt; I'm making that as a statement before God. Regardless of what comes our way, there is no excuse &gt;&gt; to keep me. There's nothing that can justify me missing God's best. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. There's going to be a meeting in the air. Perhaps I can pick up on this at another time. I had that place where brother Bry just referred to that song. you know, we're we're participating upon something that is rich. It's not everybody's food. And when I spoke to the our guide who we've already wrote back in Turkey, and I told him very quickly, this may not be for you. This may not be yours, but nevertheless, this is what God has done in this time. I'm going to send you this book so you can read it yourself. You're going to hear things that you never heard before when you read the church ages. I'm anxious to hear what kind of response comes back, but I'm glad I can announce to you as a congregation this morning. I believe that here's a body of people and and I desire with everything that's in me that were able to continue. And I believe that the smile of God's approval has been upon us. And I realize that Satan would try to do every and anything that he could to deter, to derail, to distract, and to keep you from everything that God has. But I'd like you to resolve this morning. Nothing, nothing can turn me aside. I'm resolved. I'm resolved to enter the kingdom. I'm resolved to be faithful to the very end. I'm resolved at all cost regardless. Amen. And if you have been harboring, if you have been using an excuse, well, it's because my husband is what he is, or my wife is what she is, or because the church is what it is, or hey, those things may be true. Like the man says, I bought a piece of ground. That wasn't a lie. He did. The other one said, I bought five yolk of oxen. That wasn't a lie. He did. An excuse wasn't just a fabrication. It was it was something that was reality. The other one said, "I married a wife." And he did. &gt;&gt; It was a reality, &gt;&gt; but it wasn't justifiable. &gt;&gt; And you know, I don't want to end this on a down note, but when a person's when a person is inclined, and I've heard it amongst believers, that's why I'm preaching this. I felt it was very necessary. There's people who perhaps within the sound of my voice that have had such disappointments in life. Well, because of that I'm I am where I'm at. Because of that, I'm going this direction. Because of that, I'm I'm I'm laxing off. It won't work, friends. And let me let me remind you the Bible doesn't say and then the man the father doesn't say he was disappointed says he was angry after all this preparation after all this sending of a messenger after all that he'd prepared. And here's a people been invited by the grace of God by his longsuffering and invited and and drawn in and wooed over and and and uh uh the the wings of the dove fluttering over you and bringing you to himself and then and then somehow Satan's able to devise some little puny weak thing that begins to distract us in terms of well I don't feel you know I got a reason to be this way. I I got a reason to feel the way I do and and yeah, let a root of bitterness. Let a root of hardness come in. Fail in the house of God. Fail our brothers and sisters. And don't don't reach out and don't get what we're supposed to get. God God saved you for a purpose. God brought you in for a purpose. And I don't care whether it's hardship one way or whether it's prosperity the other way. Both are very dangerous. I would say prosperity is more dangerous than the other. And then Jesin waxed fat. Didn't say he waxed poor. He waxed fat and when he waxed fat that's when he kicked and he you know became you know it was just strange things that happened to us that way and so I say let's get our eyes off of all of those things get our eyes off of everyone else &gt;&gt; and get our eyes on the kingdom alone &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; hallelujah don't lax off people &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ let's have that ferveny say what you used to be we ought to be more than that now. &gt;&gt; We're further down the road. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. All right. Do we have Oh, great. They're all here. It's going to be meeting in the air. [Music] There's going to be a me in the sweet and I glory [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] sing [Music] and rise. You've heard of little Moses in the bull rock.

I the Lord will surely let us meet them. And that being in the air. Oh, there we are in the air in the sea. by and by going to the angel over there and home beyond the sky.

I fall over there and be [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] will be the leading one that's pleasing in the air. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All our labors and all of our prayers and all of our preaching, everything that you have witnessed and been a witness to. Let me tell you, before God, it'll be worth every bit of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're going to have prayer and there I want everyone to join in prayer with me. whenever I feel and know that God has directed me in a certain way to a certain message. And I'd like to tell you, I didn't tell you earlier, but I tried to avoid this message this morning. I I had another subject I wanted to preach on. So all week while I was away, I thought I I would like to come to a different subject for this morning. But God knew who was going to be here, who maybe was going to be an internet congregation. And I know that it is for some perhaps several individuals. I haven't got anybody really in my mind, but I know that we are all can be afflicted this way. And Satan can I I I preach this morning to diffuse him. I preach this morning to slay his efforts and to bring them to not in the presence of the almighty God. And if you're here this today, you're here this morning and oh, how you have been so plagued with this uh very excuse, some excuse that Satan has given as a justifiable reason to miss out on the best things. Don't let him rob you any longer. And I'm going to pray. The people are going to pray and God is going to move on the scene. This supernatural God that will move beyond the province of my ability to speak. He will move and confirm the word with signs following. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Is this a believing congregation this morning? I know that you are. Don't be ashamed to raise your hand. Say, "It's me, oh Lord. It's me, not someone else. I've used that weak, frail thing and I'll not use it anymore. Almighty God, you are indeed the giver of every good gift. And this morning, Lord, we're aware once again you've sent your word. And when you were here, Lord Jesus, and the words came out of those marvelous lips, words that were so gracious, you said, and it is recorded, you sent your word and healed them. We have here, Lord, those who no doubt need a healing. They need a healing within their soul, within their spirit. Lord, the enemy has caused them to stumble or caused them to withdraw, to hold back, to relax or to become despondent and discouraged. I speak, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, to these spirits of discouragement, to these spirits who have tried to find a justifiable reason to keep their foot in the door. We speak to you, Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ and call upon you to depart out of these lives. Leave God's property. Depart out of our realm. Depart out of this sanctuary which is a place of holiness and a place where God is lifted up. May these Lord sons and daughters of yours be set free in the name of Jesus Christ. And I pray that their vision will become clear and that they will become focused. They will see nothing but the prize which is before them. May they settle, oh God, and become resolved within themselves. And I pray you'll put your stamp of approval upon the resolve within their soul. May they march forward like a mighty army. Hallelujah. as a testimony to this wicked, vile, dark generation. In the name of Jesus Christ, I commit these words to you and I commit this group of people to you. The blessed of the Lord, the Exodus people, may they rejoice in the God of their salvation and the great things that you have spread out before us. We thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, give him praise all ye people. Oh, for his blood has cleansed every stain. His arm is not short. His power is not depleted. Lean upon him now. Call upon him now and enjoy the great salvation and deliverance of our God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Bless your name, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Onward Christian soldiers marching as to war. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can tell you, I can assure you that there the enemy of our soul despises.
