Brother Ernie, would you come please open the service? word of prayer. [music] He also has a testimony he wanted to share with us. Brother Mike Gandandy has just asked that we please remember Sister Debbie. She is home with [music] problems in her back and hip. Asking that the Lord would grant her a healing touch this morning. [music] Brother John Dodd has a testimony. As many of you know, I've had an affliction with my swallowing for quite some time. And on Wednesday night after the service, I got something stuck in my throat. And after having a scope done at the hospital, they discovered that the mucus lining was torn. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; After a lot of testing, they found out it would not require surgery. And praise God, I have been made whole. [music] Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you, brother John. Amen. Maybe the brothers could also just come and prepare for the morning offering at this time. And then immediately [music] after the offering, we will have the Sunday school come. So, if they could just be prepared. Amen. If there's something on your heart that you just like a touch from the Lord this morning, Amen. I just encourage you to reach out in faith as brother Ernie would come. Thank you, brother Ernie. [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's bow our heads for a moment of prayer. [music] Father, the words have [music] not been written or even imagined to say how blessed we are to be a a part of the elect of God. &gt;&gt; The elite [music] of God by the grace of God. And Lord, when your word came, the revelation [music] produced a a spiritual revolution in our lives. Has led to a supernatural restoration that's brought us all the way back to Eden, all the way back to what Adam and [music] Eve had available to them before the fall has been restored back to the bride. And we're so thankful and so so grateful for the blessings in your word. And each one of those words in the Bible are anointed [music] and the promises are are lying there waiting for us to believe them and confess them and possess them. Lord, [music] &gt;&gt; we're so thankful, Father, for your intervening touch when when one of us has a need and various various and sunundry needs in the body, Lord. But &gt;&gt; in your time, God is in time, on time all the time. [music] And Lord, for sister Debbie having trouble at home. We pray right now as I'm sure she's probably listening to the service. I pray that right now, Lord, that your Holy Spirit would reach down into the room where she is and touch her and make her every wit whole. Father, let her be able to stand up and rejoice and be able to testify that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And God has met her personally, an individual at her point of need. We thank you for the testimony that was given Lord for our brother that went to the hospital and uh after prayer all was well with him. [music] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said prayer is the most powerful weapon in the Christian's arsenal. We're so thankful Lord that that when we we pray that your line is is never busy that you can you can hear every request all the time 24 hours a day from from your bride all around the world. And brother Brandham said, "Don't ask God for little things. Ask him for great big things. Ask him for spiritual things, Lord." And today, we pray that you would move and and and Lord, if there are physical or financial or spiritual or emotional needs or decisions that are going to be made, we pray, Lord, that you would move and the right move would be made by each one, Lord, that has that need. Lord, we pray for the word that's going to be spoken this morning. We pray for a great liberty and a great anointing to come upon our pastor as he stands behind the sacred desk. Lord, just allow him to be able to deliver what God has put on his heart in a supernatural way. And let us receive it in a supernatural way. And let us receive the benefit, Lord, of what's going to be spoken to us. [music] We ask all these blessings in your precious and holy name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. I wanted to give a very very short testimony. Uh a while ago uh I was faced with a decision to move and uh I know moving is never fun for anybody and when you've been in a house for 15 years you accumulate a lot and uh you know when it comes to spiritual things or or business things I have accumulated you know just a ton of things and uh brother brother Martin Walman a deacon I I I just have to say he is a deacon above deacons. He's you know to me he's everything that a deacon should be and more. And I cannot put in words what a blessing he has been to me to come over. And he's a master organizer, put everything in order, where everything had to go. And I don't know how many trips that he has taken to the recycle bin with paper and boxes and uh recycling all the electronic equipment that was out of date that are boat anchors. And he just hauled everything everything away. It was here one minute, the next minute every everything was gone. And uh it was just it was it was like totally supernatural. And yesterday I wanted to do a move in two parts. And so brother Tim Andes, he put the word out on the uh the backyard ministry team. And I want to thank brother Tim for that wherever he is. And uh and brother Ron Cowwell was inspired to to have him add anybody who came and helped move. There was going to be a barbecue at his house. So, Brother Ron and Sister Star had a a great feast of a barbecue, and we had 14 young men show up at my house yesterday morning at 10:00. And I think it took us maybe uh maybe two hours to to take. And uh again, it it it seems so supernatural because there was just tons and tons and tons of furniture and boxes and uh books and Bibles and just enormous enormous amount of things. And I looked around and they said, "Where where do you want this, brother? Where do you want this? This is going this going. This go and all of a sudden everything was gone." And we're over at Brother Ron's house having a a barbecue. And it seemed like everything happened like like in a flash. And so, uh, you know, I just wanted you to know what's amongst us, that backyard ministry team. &gt;&gt; And, uh, I also wanted to thank a couple of of, uh, sisters that have helped. Sister, uh, Karen Hendrickson came over and, uh, she is a master packer. I I She's extraordinary. And, uh, and Sister Star Cwell came over and packed. Sister Ruth Frederick helped pack. And, Brother Diana uh, Walman uh, brought food over. and uh brother Richard Pettingale came over yesterday and brother Steve Rivas and all of his uh his boys. And so yesterday was I mean you want to talk about a 10,000 lb load lifted off your shoulders. I feel light as a feather today and I just want to thank God. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to invite the Sunday school to come now. And maybe just as they come, why don't we sing thanks. Thanks. I give you thanks. And we want everyone's attention for a moment. The service tonight is going to be at 4:30. So, we're going to start the service immediately at 4:30 and give us a little bit of extra time for Lord's table this evening. So, everyone be here on time, a little early, and we'll get started right at 4:30. All right, [music] everybody's got that. Praise the Lord. All right, why don't we sing as the Sunday school comes. Thanks. Thanks. [music] I give you thanks [music] for all you [singing] [music] my soul. [music] Oh Lord, I give you praise. [music] I give you praise. I thank for all [music] you. [singing] I am so blessed and my [music] soul is at [singing] rest. I give [music] you thanks once again. Thanks for thanks. Thanks. I give [music and singing] you thanks for all you. [singing] I [music] am so blessed and my soul is happy. Oh Lord, I give you thanks. One more time. [music] I give you thanks for all [music] you done. [singing] I am so glad my soul [music] [singing] is blessed. Oh Lord, I give you praise. [music] Amen. I think what we have right here is something to be very thankful for. A group of young people like this. Praise the Lord. Wonderful. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You praise the [music] Lord. You praise the Lord. You got to praise the Lord. [music] You got to praise the Lord. [music] My feet to praise the Lord. You praise the Lord. [music] You got to praise [singing] the Lord. [music] You got to praise the Lord. I to praise [music and singing] the Lord. I to praise the Lord. You got to praise the Lord. [music] You got to praise the Lord. My [music] heart to praise the [singing] Lord. I my heart to praise [music] the Lord. Why you got to praise the Lord? [singing] Why [music] you got to praise the Lord? My hands [music] to praise the Lord. I command my hands to [music] praise the Lord. You got to praise [singing] the Lord. You got to praise the Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; And I can great I am. I can be [music] the unbelievable. I can. [singing] I can. And I know I will. Cuz with him all [music] things are possible. Cuz with him all things are possible. [music] I can I can do the great I am. I can do the [music] [singing] unbelievable. I can I can [music] [singing] all things are possible. [music] You think all things are possible. [music] God's power in a tiny sea. It grows [music] in flowers [singing] and becomes a tree. So in God's hands, if I [music] just believe, you'll do gater things through someone like [singing] me. [music] I can I can do the un. [music] I can. I know I will. Cuz with him all things are [singing and music] possible. With him all things are possible. [music] A boy named [singing] David stood by himself. Overcame a giant cuz he had God's help. Moses [music] set God's people free. [singing] He believed and the Lord opened up the sea. I [music] can. I can. I [music] can. I can. [music] If I [singing] fall in the mountain, I won't [music] turn [singing] away. Along by this rain, we will [music] make a way. I can [music] I can the great I am. I can do the unbelieable. [music] I can I [singing] can I know I will. [music] All things are possible. Can I do the unbelievable? I [music] can. I can. And I grow [singing] wilder. Cuz again within all things are [music] possible. Within all things are possible. [music] All things are possible. [singing] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; These guys never cease to amaze me ever. Um in John 15:5 Jesus said, "I am the vine and ye are the branches and ye that abide he that abideth in me and I in him. The same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing." It's an interesting note that the vine produced the branch and the vine empowered that branch to produce fruit. And uh you know it says in Philippians 4:13, I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. And I know brother Brandham, you know, he talks about when the bride of Christ ever realized who she was. And I think if we actually realize that um we're actually God wrapped in flesh, not some kind of little piece of flesh trying to house an almighty God, we'd be further down the road. And I just I it's an interesting song. Love the song. And yet there's we're still here. So there's obviously a seed somewhere out there that needs to be found. And and uh hence the reason for a missionary offering for the Sunday school. And uh if I can have sister Hannah Ray come, brother Bisll, have you come too? And um Brother Joseph, you can grab that box. Thank you. Thank you. And what is this? Now we need a muscle man to carry this. Thank you. Sunday school. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [applause] [applause] I always think it's so commendable that uh that the Sunday school has Sunday school superintendent who has always had the missions on his mind on his heart. God bless you, brother Richard, and for the all the teachers and for the students of Sunday school. Some of them are small, but just waited. Time goes by very quickly. Missionary offering. Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday School. The Sunday School of Cloverdale Bible Way would like to present their 2014 missionary offering to Bible believers to be used wherever it is needed most. This year's missionary offering consists of $31643 Canadian and $2225 US for a total of $53843. Brother Richard Drake. Is that wonderful? [applause] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Well, maybe just as the Sunday school is finding their seats, why don't we sing, "Blessed be the name of the Lord. He is worthy to be praised and adored." And we'll just turn the service directly to the word. Amen. [music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. He is worthy to be [music] praised [singing] and adore. So we lift up holy hands in one more [music] sing [singing] blessed be the name. Blessed be the name. [music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. [music] Oh, blessed be [singing] the name of the Lord. He [music] is worthy and [music] for [singing] my Lord. [music] Sing blessed be. Blessed be the name. [singing] Blessed be the name [music] of the world. Blessed be Lord. Blessed [music] be the name [singing] of the Lord. For he is [music] worthy to be praised and Lord and so you [music] sing blessed be the name. Blessed [music] be the name. Blessed be the name [music] of the Amen. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful day. &gt;&gt; And I'm sure that all the all the school students can say praise the Lord for more than one reason. Now their classes are over. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ernie felt that 10,000 pounds went off or tons, whatever it was. And uh I will feel better in another 2 or 3 hours. And and we'll all feel wonderful before this day is over. &gt;&gt; We'll say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's been good to be at a communion and footwashing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Expect it, friends. &gt;&gt; Because you'll get what exactly what you expect. Uh and so at uh at 4:30 we're going to start promptly so that as we the saints from uh Seattle, Tacoma and so on will be able to get uh out just a little bit earlier and we're happy about that. Amen. Amen. Is everyone in expectation? &gt;&gt; All right. Well, I'll have you stand and we're going to just sing while everyone's getting settled. I'd like to sing I'm amazed that he loved me. I'm amazed at what he's doing, friends. [music] And I'd like to put you in not necessarily expectation, [music] but I would like to say to you that uh by the Lord's help, I want to speak a second part to the two worlds. [music] And uh uh I feel that these are very very important service for me. It's a very important services. [music] So I pray that tonight that this today God will put you [music] in uh in a condition who knows we might be on the other side having [music] having the Lord's table and another one. It can happen just like that. Amen. So let's just sing it together. [music] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed that you love me. [music] I came [music] through to your preious [music] and my [singing] heart. [singing] [music] Now, we're going to sing it once again. I would like everyone [music] while people are getting settled, let's not bother looking around. Let's just focus on him. We're singing it to him. I'm amazed, Lord, [music] that you love me. I'm amazed that you sent such a perfect word, a bleeding word. Hallelujah. I'm amazed. [music] I [music] don't [music] I [singing] [music] [music and singing] Heavenly Father, how true it is. Our hearts are filled with thanksgiving [music] and words cannot express what's in our hearts. Oh [music] God, we think that you picked us up out of the miry clay. You picked us up out of the filth of this world. You picked us up out of dark le oysia and with a glorious word you sent a message to us. Rise and shine. Your light has come. Oh God, I pray that the glorious light of the Holy Spirit will radiate out of every person. Oh God, I think of the uh those that have young children, those that are young parents, mothers are perhaps busy with their parents, with their children. But Lord, I pray that you will give them uh give them an opportunity to hear your word. And I pray you'll give the children not only an opportunity but a capacity to understand it. Oh God, let none be distracted. I pray, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, we give ourselves completely. I give myself holy over to you, Father, for this day is the Lord's day and it we will be glad and rejoice in it. God, your will be done. May your name be glorified as we seek to prepare ourselves for the crossing over time in the name of Jesus Christ, our beloved shepherd. Amen. [music] Amen. God bless you. I'll ask you to take your Bible and uh you can turn to John's gospel, the first chapter. But before we read, I'll just make a few comments just before we read the verses. We're going to start in verse 14 and read down to 18. And then I have two, three other verses we want to read. I'd like to just give a summary of the message. [clears throat] And I thought of all of those that have studied and students and the graduations uh ceremonies that have just taken place and how acquainted you are. So I [clears throat] thought of you while I was studying. I would like to include in this message and the message is going to go in a in a a very specific sequence sequence. So it will need your full attention. If you miss one of the sequences, it you'll kind of get lost. I want to speak on the origin of unbelief. The disobedience of course which is sin. The origin of it. Then how God created the element of time to destroy the works of Satan. Thirdly, but when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman, made under the law. Fourth, for this purpose the son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And fifth, our includes all of us here. Our allotted time in this world to fulfill our part in God's plan to destroy the enemy. And if you'll think and of this out of the bosom of the father and I'll be going over these. Out of the bosom of the father came that that little mystic light that halo that he said we'll call it the son of god. Out of the bosom of the father came the son of god. But I want to put it in two concise terms. Out of the bosom of the father came redemption and destruction. Amen. &gt;&gt; Both we will read, "And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, "This was he of whom I spake. He that cometh after me is preferred before me. He for he was before me and of his fullness have all we received and grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man hath seen God at any time. The only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father. He hath declared him. In the eth chapter, John 8:42. I'm just going to read one verse. John 8 and 42. Jesus said unto them, "If God were your father, you would love me. For I proceeded forth and came from God. Neither came I of myself, but he sent me. &gt;&gt; In the 13th chapter verse three, Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands, that he was come from God and went to God. And the next verse and the next verses tell us how he gerted himself and washed the disciples feet. And tonight you will do that. But before he gerted himself, just before he girded himself, uh he said that knowing that God had given all things into his hands and knowing that he was come from God and went to God, &gt;&gt; he ged himself. So I think this evening, even if you prepare this morning for tonight when you get down to wash one another's feet, you'll also have that uh knowledge I came from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I go back to God &gt;&gt; and this is a brother. This is a sister. And I wash their feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a reality. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. I'm reading one more verse and you can just listen as I read it. It's 1 John 3:8. [clears throat] He that committh sin is of the devil. For the devil sinnth from the beginning. Then especially this line, for this purpose the son of God was manifested or for this purpose the son of God appeared. For this purpose the Son of God was made known. This is what we saw. For this purpose that he might destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; And don't forget that the scripture says also that the great mystery that was unfolded is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; And for this purpose &gt;&gt; he was manifested. And I would like to extend that and say and for this purpose he's manifested in you &gt;&gt; that he might destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; So I'll be coming to that and I think probably it might be quite a surprise to some. I am going to maybe we can just dim the lights a wee bit. I want to read these quotes together with you. I I have here the summary of the messages. But when the fullness of time was come as we're speaking about time and our allotted time in this world to fulfill our part in God's plan and then this great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels. It [clears throat] first start. It first started. The first battle was in heaven. So sin did not originate on the earth but in heaven. And then it was thrown down from [clears throat] heaven, cast out of heavens to the earth and fell on human beings. Then the battle from angels became human battles and Satan came to destroy God's creation. What God had created to be for himself. He had Satan came to destroy this. That's what his purpose was was to destroy it. Then the battle begin here on earth and begin in us and has been raging ever since. You can never evade that scripture &gt;&gt; that or or and I consider it as scripture not as the bi not from the Bible but it is a revelation of of the word of God. I hope you understand that and it has been raging. The reason I say it that way is because I do not know any believer where this has not been raging. Amen. &gt;&gt; This service is going to help many of you. [clears throat] Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil. [clears throat] And you believe that? Now, I can't explain all this. Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil. Is that right? You all believe that? &gt;&gt; What was he? God's word which destroys the works of the devil. Is is that right? He was done to do that. He was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil. Now his body is to do the same. &gt;&gt; We should say that together, please. Now his body is to do the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the body is head and body is together. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said it'll take this ministry to unite the two together. &gt;&gt; And that has happened. &gt;&gt; That's already happened, friend. Don't be left in the dust. That's already happened. &gt;&gt; It will take this ministry and the manifestation that was seen in the prophet's ministry. He said it would take the ministry exactly like the ministry of Jesus Christ to unite the head and the body together. And what is the purpose of the body? To destroy the works of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Now his body is to do the same because the body is head and body is together. If Christ is the head was the word, his body has to be the same thing as his head was. A church of the word. Born of the word. Virgin born from the word. Not denominational now. Virgin born from the word. Let us say that last phrase. Virgin born from the word. Once again, virgin born from the word. Do you believe that? Virgin born from the word. &gt;&gt; That's the only kind the word produces. Virgin born from the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Now, I just have a few more here. [clears throat] Lucifer was kicked out and came to the earth. Then he polluted Eden. Then he's been polluting ever since. &gt;&gt; And now from the battle in heaven, it's coming to the battle on earth. And it is to be finished on earth &gt;&gt; at the end time in the battle of Armageddon. &gt;&gt; It's to be finished on earth. What battle? The battle between God and Satan. The battle between right and wrong. The battle between clean and unclean. The battle between truth and deception. It'll be finished, friends. &gt;&gt; We have that promise. You had that promise. It won't always be exactly what we're experiencing. It won't be that way. &gt;&gt; This is God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I want to take that back. [clears throat] Now, here I'm laying a real close foundation. So, he was first God. You've heard me read this before. So, he was first God. Jehovah, let's see coming out of space where there's nothing. Let's make a little white light like a mystic light, like a halo. And that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning. Now, let me just stop here and have you stop reading for a moment. To think that this may be well, I I can't quite understand that. Listen friends, the scientists go up with uh uh with a telescope and and and they show the planets and and the explosions off the sun and and all these glorious things in the heavens. You don't understand that. &gt;&gt; You don't understand just some gases. &gt;&gt; We don't understand some atomic powers or hydrogen powers or we don't know what kind of powers it is. And and and we don't understand the space. If we don't understand the millions of light years that all us if we don't understand that how we can understand um God appearing himself in a mystic light trying to come down so we can so we in this human condition think about it born from a woman &gt;&gt; by humans and we can understand God &gt;&gt; we can place God in time &gt;&gt; let's get real How can you get the one when we don't even understand what he created? How are we going to understand the creator? &gt;&gt; I think one of the things we need to under we don't want to misunderstand. We don't under underestimate our ignorance. &gt;&gt; We don't want to underestimate that. We we we're we're such finite beings and he's the infinite. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we'll continue to read for a [clears throat] moment. Like a halo and that was the logos that went out of God. And when we speak about logos, people get lost in it. But logos and don't close your mind now and think, well, I don't understand that. Yeah, you'll understand it. It's what a person intends, what God intended to do, and he spoke it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And as I've asked the congregation, what language did he use? We don't know. What sound was it? &gt;&gt; We don't know that either. So a lot I think the what we don't know is a whole lot more than what we know. &gt;&gt; We just do not know exactly what that was. But the prophet said if he said let there be light and there came a fog, then it wasn't the word of God. &gt;&gt; There is light. We go out today. Thank God the sun's shining. So, we're thankful there was light. And we're going to come come to that in just a few moments. And the logos went out of God in the beginning. That was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father. Now, now John the uh Baptist, he spoke that. That's what he said. He came out of the bosom of the father and the bosom. So, he had he he had some understanding. he was trying to convey to the people. And the bosom is is there's several words in the scripture that refer to the bosom, but the bosom to put it simply is from the intimate part. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ proceeded from the intimate part of God. &gt;&gt; The logos, the word, the intent, that in internal person, &gt;&gt; that internal being. That's why he had all the attributes of God. He was from the intimate part of God from the bosom of the father. There's only one came from the bosom of the father. And all that he was, he would pour into a body called a bride &gt;&gt; for himself. &gt;&gt; Where do you think you came from? &gt;&gt; The bosom, &gt;&gt; the bosom of the father. &gt;&gt; As it came out of the bosom of the father. And that was what was in the beginning was the word. and the word was with God. So when we hear the word the word the word the word, don't don't forget that it's not just some syllables and something that's on in an alphabet. It's not that. &gt;&gt; It's something that God had within himself &gt;&gt; that he intended. And he had intended. I can tell you what he had intended in a few words. He intended to bring his children, the elected and the redeemable &gt;&gt; back to himself. &gt;&gt; What I had in my mind, I will bring back to myself. &gt;&gt; And the rest and the enemy, my arch enemy who rose against me with disobedience and with pride in his heart and with an iniquity in his heart. I have set in motion a plan and I'll destroy him &gt;&gt; and all angels that he took with him &gt;&gt; and all people who believe him. &gt;&gt; I will destroy it. It shall not be in existence anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. I don't want to go to any other place. And that was the word that was made flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. I'm going to just leave that now for a moment. coming into existence. He said a little white light and we'll call it like a halo. I'm not repeating, but this is from another message. And he says something just a little different. I want him. You can turn the lights on now if you wish, please. And that was the son of God, the logos, and went out of God in the beginning. And then and then that how that he was standing there. I want you to catch that phrase. He was standing there and he in his mind he be to think of what the world would be and drew all of this pictured in his mind and he said let there be light. So now we've moved to a very important station. time came into existence. You graduates that graduated, uh, I'll use you as an example, you've just said now 12 years is over and you get your cap and gown and so on so forth. And you were given these years time, &gt;&gt; so much time &gt;&gt; to study your books and do your assignments. And you had a certain amount of time to do your assignment. Hand that in. &gt;&gt; Complete this. And then when you have completed this, you will write this examination that will show that you have studied this assignment and you have a certain amount of time and year after year after year and finally you come to graduation and you graduate. What is graduation? you it it's it simply demonstrates that these students who are sitting here seated seated here have completed this work &gt;&gt; and they're not the same as when they entered in grade one. &gt;&gt; They have matured. &gt;&gt; They have learned. What have they learned? They learned what they were taught. &gt;&gt; You're sitting here learning. &gt;&gt; What are you learning? You're learning something of spiritual things. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're learning something that God by his holy spirit &gt;&gt; and he everything that he can. He sends gifts and he sends men and he sends prophets and he sends Jesus Christ and he sends all of this so that humanity can hear so the world will be without excuse. And he will through that method. That means he will call every one of his elected &gt;&gt; because he put a seed in them, &gt;&gt; predestinated seed that's attracted to that. &gt;&gt; This is the voice I've been waiting to hear. And you that have been in school, some teachers are able to instructors are able to get more perhaps out of the student and certain ones seem to fit you and you can understand them and the way that they uh speak it. They're not preaching, but the way that they speak it and the way they teach and this is important, very important. Now, [clears throat] I would think that if you get that in your mind, I have to start. I have a beginning and I'm going to end. I I want to finish this project. Some of you that are in business or you've gone on to further education, you've gone and you you started something. You commenced it and you went through a series of of teaching or lessons or sermons or whatever more and then you come to an end and you said, "I I finished now what I've heard and learned in the book and what I've been instructed in." That's precisely God's program. Amen. &gt;&gt; We as humans have only borrowed it &gt;&gt; for other purposes to learn to be a electrician or a plumber or a a financial advisor or something. We've learned that &gt;&gt; girls learn from their mother. They learn certain uh tricks and the certain things in the kitchen. And so where do you learn that? I learned it from my mother. I I learned that from somebody. And that's exactly what we're we're here doing. And this is God's program now. He brought light into existence &gt;&gt; to deal with sin. &gt;&gt; And he says that and he stood there and in his mind he be to think of what the world would be. And he drew all of this, pictured it out in his mind. This is the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to rid sin from our lives. That's the message. and he pictured it in his mind and he said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "And God said, let them be for signs &gt;&gt; and for seasons and for days and for years." &gt;&gt; So God allotted his word from the very beginning. And then he said, "And why little Bethlehem?" He said, "God in every age allotted his word from the beginning." &gt;&gt; Truly, as we have a prophet, &gt;&gt; one one is in 53 and the other's in 63. &gt;&gt; Don't they fit together? &gt;&gt; And he stood there and while he was standing, he said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; He pictured the whole world and what it would be. &gt;&gt; He pictured every person. He knew he knew you. He knew exactly how you would get here. &gt;&gt; He knew your nature. &gt;&gt; He knew what part where to place you in the plan. &gt;&gt; Just imagine if he placed a bunch of us back in the days of Jesus back in those days. No, it wasn't only the fullness of time for Jesus. It was the fullness of time for Caiaphas &gt;&gt; and for the Pharisees and the Sadducees. You know why the Pharisees were sad or the Sadducees were sad? Because they didn't believe in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; So that's why they were so sad. You see, &gt;&gt; if I didn't believe in the resurrection, I'd be a sad you see also. &gt;&gt; And so he said in 53, and so he said, "Let there be light." In 63 he refers and he says God in every age allotted his word from the beginning. He allotted a certain amount &gt;&gt; of time. &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; which he had created. He allotted a certain amount of time &gt;&gt; to pass by when certain thing would start. &gt;&gt; And so when the fullness of time came, &gt;&gt; Jesus came. He came. That was the fullness of time for him. When the fullness of time came for Mary, she gave birth, a virgin Mary gave birth to this to to a child, a son who was known as the son of God, &gt;&gt; the son of man, the son of God. Allotted a certain amount of time, he created a a a record of the manifested thoughts of God. A record. And as those thoughts were manifested, God and I can't describe him, but God in his mind who drew all things out says, "I I'm manifesting the word now. I'm destroying more my enemy. I'm destroying him. I'm doing away with him." And he's coming in with more deception. I'm destroying it with truth. I'm manifesting truth. &gt;&gt; And truth and truth is light. And the light is keeping rising. The light is coming. The light is being shed abroad in the hearts of people. And I elected that this one would come. This one would come and these would come and these would come. And when the fullness of time came here, they sprung up. &gt;&gt; What for? To manifest the word. And the manifested word is here to destroy the works of the enemy. Don't ever let him bamboozle you that you have to cowtow to the enemy. You don't have to bend or bow to him. You certainly won't burn with him. God sent you here to be victorious over this enemy. Absolutely victorious. That's the whole purpose of the plan. &gt;&gt; He didn't send you here to be defeated. He didn't send you here to be despondent and discouraged. He sent you here to be victorious. &gt;&gt; I'm going to surprise some of you sometimes. I want to come to the end of this service. At towards the end, I want to speak of the power &gt;&gt; of the lived out life. &gt;&gt; Just a quiet lived out life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By living out &gt;&gt; manifesting the character of Jesus Christ. You may not say a lot, but that is God's weapon &gt;&gt; against the deception. &gt;&gt; The one who stands and is unmoved is the power of God against deception. &gt;&gt; The one who stands for truth, you don't have to say a lot. You don't have to be a preacher. You don't have to do a lot of things. You don't have to do any miracles. You live the life of God's life in you. And it defeats the enemy &gt;&gt; at every junction. &gt;&gt; I declare it in the name of Jesus Christ. It defeats the enemy. &gt;&gt; Whether you're in school or whether you're in university or whether you're at a workplace or whether you're in the shopping mall, all you have to do is live the life. And someone like Sammy Keane will come by and see your sister Reena Wit. And the power of God and sister Reena Whit when she didn't even know she was being looked upon, the power of God was defeating the kingdom of Satan in this other woman's life. &gt;&gt; Let us rejoice. &gt;&gt; Isn't this glorious? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And down through the centuries of time, &gt;&gt; God manifested his plan &gt;&gt; through the lives of believers. &gt;&gt; Students, you aren't the only ones who got a good report. And all these &gt;&gt; Hebrews 12, Hebrews 11. And all these &gt;&gt; having obtained a good report, &gt;&gt; I would say they retain obtained a good report by the master teacher. &gt;&gt; The master of all. &gt;&gt; No professor ever even &gt;&gt; came to know anything of the things that God knew as a as an instructor. And all these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise. They didn't receive it in this life. They didn't get to see it, &gt;&gt; but they believed in the promise &gt;&gt; though we may not see it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham lived to see the rapture and sister Glattis Dao told me she was sitting in the car in the back seat and she just said she's very forward. She said, "Brother Vandom, are you going to be here at the rapture?" And he said, "No, I'm going to be killed." Some kind of explosion. Said, "It might be a gunshot or something, but some kind of explosion. It was a car crash." &gt;&gt; That was the kind of explosion. He said, "I wouldn't be here." But did he stop believing it? &gt;&gt; One of his last messages is rapture. &gt;&gt; How to prepare for the rapture. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we're children of faith. &gt;&gt; We pray for the sick. We believe they'll be healed. &gt;&gt; We pray for the diseased. We believe in miracles. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. Say, "Well, I haven't seen it." You believe and you shall see. &gt;&gt; That's the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the fullness of time of come was come, God sent forth his sign. Now, God knew that was going to happen when he said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; He knew that there would come a time, a time &gt;&gt; because time had its commencement. Amen. &gt;&gt; How God who's eternal can't be put into time. &gt;&gt; He didn't. God didn't begin. Then &gt;&gt; the light began &gt;&gt; and light began to travel &gt;&gt; and began to warm the planets and so on and so forth. It might have been hundreds of millions of years. We care not. &gt;&gt; That's not for us to figure out &gt;&gt; because we couldn't understand it to begin with. And when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman, made under the law. Galatians 4:4. And now he was made. And you saw this on this on the in the slide. Christ was manifested. His purpose of being made, his purpose of being sent was to destroy. Listen friends, not to somehow make our way through this world. That's not the program. The program is destroy the works of the enemy. &gt;&gt; He was manifested to destroy the works of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you get this truth lodged in your heart, you'll realize all this other things and stuff you hear and things that you see will have no effect. It It's not that they will disappear. We're not looking for that. We're looking for for it to have no effect upon the believer. No effect whatsoever. In other words, like Mori did to Hmon. disregarded his existence, &gt;&gt; disregarded his position, &gt;&gt; disregarded his authority, &gt;&gt; disregarded his so-called glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So disregarded. It was his disregard that ate out. And I can tell you that it is your disregard. Your disregard, I'm saying that in faith, your disregard of all of this stuff just gnaws on Satan. He just can't stand it. &gt;&gt; And he will take that position till he falls into the flame of fire. &gt;&gt; And Mori took that position until he hung on his own gallows. &gt;&gt; Which he had intended for for I'm sorry, Hmon did, which he intended for Mori. Mordei didn't hang on the gallows. &gt;&gt; Hmon hung on his own gallows. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was born to be that &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Say, "Well, he died. He He was crucified. He looked helpless. He was born to destroy the work of the enemy." And did he not destroy? Didn't he bring death out to an open defeat when he raised and said, "Here I am." &gt;&gt; Glory. Did he raise from the dead? Did he defeat death? Did he come forth as the conqueror? Yes. He was sent to destroy the works of the enemy. And his example of life, his example of response, his example of of his victory is our example. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the testimony of Jesus Christ, the prophet said he was risen from the dead, living in his church, and he said, "The things that I do shall you also greater than this shall you do because because I go to my father." Now, the people couldn't understand how him being a man would go to the father. and yet back in and and yet back in. But he said, "I come from God &gt;&gt; and I go to God." &gt;&gt; And he came he came out of spirit. Listen now. He came out of spirit or out of eternity &gt;&gt; into time. &gt;&gt; He came out of eternity. &gt;&gt; He came out of another world &gt;&gt; to this one &gt;&gt; for one purpose, to destroy the work of the enemy. I don't want this message to ever be forgotten. If it's the last message I ever preach, I would want to preach on the defeat of Satan and the power of God. And this is why he came out of eternity, out of the great realms of eternity with one intent in mind, destroy the works of Satan. And I rejoice when I look upon the congregation of people and realize that the elect, the elect, he sent a word to call them out of this, out of this organization and out of this world council and out of all of these things and the elect have responded to it. &gt;&gt; Glory. He came out of eternity into time for the taking away of sin and he passed through time went back into eternity. So it was God &gt;&gt; and he's with us &gt;&gt; and he's with us. Now we're not supposed to break the intensity of what is being spoken. And he is with us. this one who sent his son and when the fullness of time came he was born of a in the simplicity &gt;&gt; to a virgin. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And he passed through time went back into eternity. So it was God and he's with us. &gt;&gt; Raised from the dead. And the things that he did in the days of his flesh, he's doing tonight &gt;&gt; and he's been doing since he rose from the dead. &gt;&gt; Shall the prophet put it all back into time &gt;&gt; all through those centuries. Do you believe it, friend? in seal of God. This is the sequence now. And he lived here on earth with us on earth in the form of a man. God lived in his son Christ Jesus as the God man. &gt;&gt; And he returned from glory leaving his word. A little while and the world will see me no more. Yet you will see me for I will be with you even in you. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; I will be with you even in you. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I don't really fully understand that." Do you understand him coming out of eternity? &gt;&gt; No, we don't understand that either. So, let's just do our part and believe it. &gt;&gt; Let's just repeat it &gt;&gt; like brother Tom preaches. Put it on our lips. Put these words on your lips. to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; It had a beginning. It'll have an end. The person of the Holy Spirit, God returning in the form Jesus said, "I came from God. I go to God." He came out of eternity, stepped down into time, &gt;&gt; went out of time, back into eternity. &gt;&gt; So now we're at that point at that junction &gt;&gt; in the message fellowship. And when the sting of death, now we're just stepping back while he was in time. And when the sting of death was anchored in his flesh, that's why it had to be Calvary was anchored in the in the flesh of God, it pulled the stinger out. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So today, we don't have any sting of death. Right. &gt;&gt; It can buzz &gt;&gt; and make a sound, make a noise, &gt;&gt; but we can stand like Paul that's under the fellowship. &gt;&gt; Oh, death, &gt;&gt; where's your strength? &gt;&gt; Why? Because we believe what has happened. &gt;&gt; You that are young and full of beauty and health and strength and all the rest of it. I can tell you that there's ones that are older and I can ask the older ones, where did the last 10 years go to? &gt;&gt; How many would stand say I've said that? &gt;&gt; Well, we got one. How many more do we have? There we have. Look at this crowd of people. Look at this crowd of people. I'm standing here. We got honest people here. Have you never said that? The tip never never said that. He's a hero. I want to shake his hand. See this crowd of young people? They said, "Where did the last 10 years go?" All right, you can sit down. God bless you. And there's a whole bunch more that were too shy to stand. Oh, death, where's your staying? Oh grave, where's your victory? But thanks be to God that gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. There's where death was swallowed up in victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At that at that seeler when the ladies that had, you know, they worked and they made their spices, they're just doing what ladies do. &gt;&gt; What are you doing today, dear? Well, I'm I'm making spices. You know, our our precious redeemer has been put in a tomb. He wasn't even in there. &gt;&gt; But they were making spices for somebody who wasn't there. &gt;&gt; What are they doing? They weren't They weren't fasting. They weren't having all night prayer meetings. They were just living their life. &gt;&gt; And in living their life and doing they got put into the eternal word of God &gt;&gt; doing just what women do. &gt;&gt; Just what women do. They prepare the spices and take and anoint the body &gt;&gt; and they go there and they're the first ones. They see angels. They're in contact with another world. &gt;&gt; They're not even too sure. Even the men who heard the testimony, they're not too sure. They they saw some vision. They actually saw a man &gt;&gt; who spoke to them &gt;&gt; asking them, "Why do you seek the living amongst the dead?" &gt;&gt; Because they hadn't they hadn't heard it hadn't got to they hadn't internalized the words &gt;&gt; that he'll rise again. And the bee lost his stinger. And the bee of death lost his stinger when it stung God Almighty. Manifested in flesh. Manifested in flesh. &gt;&gt; God is manifested in your flesh. &gt;&gt; God is manifested &gt;&gt; in your flesh. I'm not saying that to try to get a response out of you. I'm saying that to get it into you. &gt;&gt; God is manifest in your flesh. Well, I don't see great things. He doesn't have to do great things. He'll do whatever he wants to do. You might just be a quiet person at at your place of employment, but that God manifested in you. You might just be someone I I've never actually been able to speak to any of my neighbors, but I can tell you one thing. They all know where we go. &gt;&gt; And I have a little standing joke with my wife. I said, I we drive out of this drive so often. I think that they think we're on a drug run. So I back out and they're we've only been in five minutes. We're backing out. I said there they're saying, "Oh, there they go again. Another drug run." I said, "The only thing they don't know is what kind of drugs we have." Hallelujah. We got the inoculation. We got the remedy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; And then the prophet says, now we're in 63. He says, "And I can see eternity break, &gt;&gt; come down into time since Eden. &gt;&gt; I can see eternity break. &gt;&gt; This one who walked amongst us. &gt;&gt; This one whose tapes you hear, &gt;&gt; I can see eternity break." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And come down into time since Eden. And when it did, &gt;&gt; there come a line of blood &gt;&gt; all the way up onto Calvary. And from Calvary, tied with this line and goes on to the tiepost, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And someday when he comes to claim his own, everyone that's tied to that ultimate, &gt;&gt; I want to break here and say that is why this messenger had to say the bleeding word. That is why the message had to be crucified. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, don't be surprised that it had to be crucified &gt;&gt; because it's the same one. &gt;&gt; Each generation has to have their opportunity to hear the word and believe and disbelieve the word and be damned. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, I'm not going to be strong on those that believe without saying exactly what the scripture says about those that don't believe. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't go soft on it now. &gt;&gt; Is it the truth? &gt;&gt; I'll let you finish it. And they believed a lie &gt;&gt; and were. &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; You say it. &gt;&gt; Does it say that? &gt;&gt; I know people that don't want to believe that. &gt;&gt; Precious Bible. But they might as well tear that page out &gt;&gt; if they don't believe it. That's exactly what it says. &gt;&gt; I rejoice over it all. &gt;&gt; And someday when he comes to claim his own, everyone that's tied to that ultimate, &gt;&gt; everyone that's tied to that ultimate. Only those. You're sitting here this morning listening. You must know that you are tied to that ultimate that this messenger is speaking. He was sent from God for this allotted season. Listen to it. For the rest of this service, you have an allotted time to believe what this messenger sent. I sent him out of eternity so that you would get a message and believe that message. &gt;&gt; And everyone that believes this ultimate will be raised up into eternity. Why? They have been in eternity all the time. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're in God's mind in in God's bosom in the intimate part of God. &gt;&gt; You think you're aching to get there. He's aching to have you. &gt;&gt; He's aching to have you. He made you what you are. &gt;&gt; He deposited in you what you have. so that he can receive you to himself. &gt;&gt; What a love story. &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world. &gt;&gt; Not this chaos, not this violence, &gt;&gt; not all of this inequality and injustices, not this filth. &gt;&gt; He loved the only one that's recorded in the scripture is when he had finished his creation and was completed. He said, "It's very good." That's the world he loved. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus, the son of God, stepped down into a period of time called the end time to manifest himself to fulfill Luke 17:30. There were some that hadn't been fulfilled. And your your prophet said, your messenger said to fulfill the rest what what's what's the all the stir about? What is what's this that's happening on the mountain? What what's this that's taking place? &gt;&gt; What is it with these people? Why are they so fervent? Why are they so ardent? Why are they so have such a conviction about things? Why is it if they got to only understand, they cannot understand, can never see it, it's not me, it's him. living through &gt;&gt; to defeat and destroy the works of the enemy. &gt;&gt; And so to manifest himself fulfilling Luke 17:30, that's why you've heard quite a few of the different ministers quote and repeat things that vindicated Brother Brandham's ministry. And during the time he's calling the nation, he blinded Israel. During this allotted time, during this specific time, &gt;&gt; God sends a messenger. And during that time, someone was just at brother Randy and Sister Lorie Snow's. They have a book of uh someone has put together, brother, pardon. &gt;&gt; Generous. generation and the shows of meetings in 1947 just masses of people &gt;&gt; literally masses of people when you look at that when you see that I have it on my wall a few on my wall from Africa South Africa don't look at that and think you're looking at some history that's not history that's what God &gt;&gt; did God sent him God called all his people allowed them to be uh uh allowed them to be stirred their emotions to be stirred and their spirit and soul to be stirred too some of them but allowed them to be stirred masses and you can say where are they alive in 47 &gt;&gt; quite a few here were alive in 47 during the 50s and here's all these masses of people &gt;&gt; and during that same time during that same time it just seemed So uh such a paradox here here comes this uh after the aftermath of the second world war soldiers are returning home to America to Canada to the the UK Australia and different places different nations that contributed soldiers to the war. I've mentioned it here. This small country, Canada, only had less than I I don't know what they had in 1939, but they contributed 1 million over 1 million fighting men to the Second World War. Was actually more per capita than any nation and fought some terrible, terrible battles and lost some of our best young men. A whole generation of young men were lost for the Second World War. And in and and in the aftermath. And then here comes the Holocaust. I have books I can't show you. I have pictures I can't show you. It's too gruesome. It's too terrible. Maniated bodies piled and stacked like cord wood. I have stood in the rooms where the ovens are and they burned them by the millions. And I walked and stood on the ground where the ashes are in Awitz and was at the 60th anniversary when the leaders of the world came and lit candles to say this must never happen again. No one ever said the tender hand of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; No one would dare say such a statement, the tender hand of Jehovah. I repeated those words to Gerson Solomon right over here at the Ramada in as we parked and his wife was at the door ready to go in. He said, "My wife has so much trouble. Why did God allow us to go through the Holocaust?" I said, "Our prophet called it the tender hand of Jehovah." And he just hung his head and looking down trying to assimilate those words. I said, "Anything less than this would not have driven your people back to Israel. And God cannot bless He said God cannot bless Israel outside of their promised land. &gt;&gt; And this Orthodox Jew said, "That's right. &gt;&gt; What is it?" &gt;&gt; Truth. &gt;&gt; Truth. &gt;&gt; Is a tender-handed Jehovah. Cuz almighty God knows he's going to give him white robes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I tell you, the white robe means a lot more than a switch. means a lot more than the ovens. Means a lot more than the ashes of this earth. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're serving almighty God. And what was God doing? He was shaking his people out of all the nations according to his word. And I will bring you back. &gt;&gt; I will scatter you, but I will bring you back. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; And thus defeating, destroying the work of Satan. I hope you people can respond in faith and believing it in all truth, friends. And I hope all those that see it on the internet are grasping what is being done, what is being said, and where we are. We're not just in a service here having a church service this morning. We are here in a certain in a certain stage, a certain phase of this mighty last message that came. Hallelujah. And that is why the scripture says that he stood upon land and upon sea and said time shall be no more. &gt;&gt; And in the Greek or in the Hebrew in the Greek it says and there will be no further delay. &gt;&gt; Delay to what? The revealing of him who was speaking. There be no further. I will come. I will manifest myself. I will appear. I will show myself. That's the pillar of fire in Houston, Texas. That's the pillar of fire in Germany. And thus all of these signs and we'll come to it in a few moments. It's God coming so close. And he's got a vessel so that he can materialize himself and come before the people so that the people will have no reason to doubt, &gt;&gt; no reason to disbelieve. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the days and he swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and things that are therein that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are in the sea and the things that are therein that there should be time no longer or there should be no further delay. I will not delay now these mysteries, these things that have been sealed. I will make them known. But in the days, the next verse, there'll be no further delay. &gt;&gt; For in the days, &gt;&gt; that's the next verse. &gt;&gt; That's the next event. &gt;&gt; For in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; And people want to say, "Well, it's not him." Well, find him then. &gt;&gt; Where is he? We have Israel back. &gt;&gt; We have all these other scriptures fulfilled. Where's this one? &gt;&gt; I challenge the world. I challenge anyone. Show me this seventh angel. Show me this one that has the vindication. Show him to me. Denying one is the easy part. That's the parkbench politician that has all the can find everything that's wrong but has no answers. Finding things that are wrong are not answers. Anybody can find things that are wrong. Any hoodlm, anybody can find things that are wrong. Find the answer for me. Give me the answer. And I say on the authority of God's eternal word, we have found the answer. Or the answer found us. The answer found me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He found you. &gt;&gt; When you weren't looking for him, he found you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This verse simply declares &gt;&gt; that there are words that are yet to be manifested. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture declares. &gt;&gt; There are words yet to be manifested. &gt;&gt; And you may be sitting here this morning and wondering, "What do I do?" You don't have to really do anything. Just believe. &gt;&gt; And when you believe, you will manifest. Somehow you will manifest it. It's not up to me to try to manifest it or up to you. We don't have to invent something new. God already has all the invention is here. &gt;&gt; Will you believe it? &gt;&gt; So when Christ is identified the same in all generations in 64 now we've moved. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, that's when time started. &gt;&gt; When eternity broke down into time, &gt;&gt; now after a while, time comes back into eternity. &gt;&gt; And he learned that in grades when he graduated out of grade seven in Kentucky. &gt;&gt; When did he learn that? Where did that come from? &gt;&gt; That wasn't any professor at any university. &gt;&gt; They don't have that kind of knowledge. They don't have that kind of inspiration. They don't have that kind of insight. They haven't got that kind of connection. They weren't taught where he was taught. &gt;&gt; You have to forgive me. I'm just having a revival up here. I'm having a wonderful time. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when time started. When eternity broke down into time. Now after a while, time comes back into eternity. Of course, time is eternity. Time is eternity too. He says, but time is aotted space. &gt;&gt; I hope you're not too tired now. &gt;&gt; I I I need a few more minutes. And that's the way the only thing we know is inches and yards &gt;&gt; and miles &gt;&gt; and figures and so forth. And all the students said &gt;&gt; All the students said &gt;&gt; I hear you yell at the ball court. All the students said &gt;&gt; amen. All we know is inches &gt;&gt; and yards &gt;&gt; and miles and figures and so forth. &gt;&gt; But that's that's nothing to God. [laughter] &gt;&gt; He don't have no time. &gt;&gt; He's always &gt;&gt; We know interest in yards and miles and figures and so on. &gt;&gt; But do you know somebody who's always? &gt;&gt; Figure that one out. You haven't got enough zeros. &gt;&gt; So a specific word I'm coming down to what I've been preaching for the whole purpose for the specific word or the thoughts of the predestinated will of God. What came out of the bosom? See I want you to see it. coming out of the bosom of God, out of his most intimate part &gt;&gt; is coming this thoughts of the predetermined will of God &gt;&gt; where to now be set in motion and God is revealed the prophet said in Christ is a revel revealed in his own word and God is revealed in every age by his promised word to that age. But when the fullness of time was come, &gt;&gt; says God sent a son. &gt;&gt; Listen folks, now when the fullness of time was come, God sent John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; When the fullness of time was come, God sent Saul of Tarsus. When the fullness of time was son, fullness of time was come, God sent William Brham. When the fullness of time was come, William Brham would could not fulfill his work of calling people out. If the calling people, so when the fullness of time this time came, God brought you forth. &gt;&gt; God brought you forth to hear it. And if we could get the testimonies throughout this audience today of how you heard it, &gt;&gt; it was absolutely remarkable. &gt;&gt; Just nothing short of supernatural. &gt;&gt; And I could keep you here the rest of the day until night telling you those things because I've lived with so many people that have had these experiences. And so God sent forth and when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son. I want you to go out of these doors today and at some point in time I want you to say these words. Your mother and dad can tell you when you were born. Said you were born in the evening. No, you were born just before midnight. You were born around noon. I want you to go out of this church today, please, and put the words of God out of his eternal word on your lips and say, "When the fullness of time was come, God sent me &gt;&gt; into the earth." Amen. &gt;&gt; To hear a specific word, not in school, how to count, &gt;&gt; not to learn your alphabet, not to learn your physics and your history &gt;&gt; and all of these advanced things perhaps in advanced learning. That isn't why he sent you here. That's to help you get through this light. He sent you here to manifest a specific word because he intends you to play a part in his destruction because that what he puts in you is Christ. And Christ came into the world to destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; And that part of Christ that you may have &gt;&gt; is for that. And if you haven't received him yet, you need to receive him &gt;&gt; if you're called. You know, there's nothing there. I'm very, very sorry. There needs to be something there. This prophet was honest enough to say also, "If you're not called, you'll never be there." &gt;&gt; He was honest. &gt;&gt; I appreciate that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it makes those that do have something &gt;&gt; within them, you know, &gt;&gt; I've been made &gt;&gt; for a higher calling. &gt;&gt; I've been made for another world. &gt;&gt; I'm not at home in this world. &gt;&gt; Uncleaness and sin has no part of me. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could say, "Satan came, but he hath found nothing in me." &gt;&gt; Say it. He has nothing in me. Glory to God. Say it in the face of Satan. &gt;&gt; Do we fail? Yes, we've failed. Have we sinned? We've all sinned and come short of the glory of God. Have we been forgiven? Yes, we've been forgiven. And more than that, we've been recreated by the new creation of Almighty God. Recreated. Virgin bride to Jesus Christ. Virgin born by the word of God. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God is his own interpreter. I'm going quickly now. Please help me. &gt;&gt; And now remember, you Christians were his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Not you were in his thoughts. He said you were his thoughts &gt;&gt; before there was a world. &gt;&gt; Figure that one out. And you are the manifestation of his thinking. &gt;&gt; What was he thinking? His thinking was, I'm going to destroy this arc enemy. I'm going to destroy this betrayer. I'm going to destroy this deceiver. I'm going to destroy him. &gt;&gt; Leave no trace of him. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends. The world passeth away. Yes. &gt;&gt; This world passes away. &gt;&gt; That world is coming into existence. &gt;&gt; That's my world. &gt;&gt; The unseen is my world. &gt;&gt; Your world is a believer. That's our world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. In other words, you're sitting here today and you're dressed in your Sunday suits and fineries. That's not why you were sent here. You were sent here to be the appearance, the demonstration of God. You'd be surprised what people say about you behind your back. &gt;&gt; I don't care what they say. &gt;&gt; Procon, indifference, &gt;&gt; liar, deceiver, whatever more doesn't make a bit of difference to me. &gt;&gt; I know what we are. I know who called me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say hallelujah to my God. &gt;&gt; Friends, I urge you to rejoice &gt;&gt; in the salvation of what God has done. I en I urge you to &gt;&gt; in the greatest battle. Let me follow quickly, please. And your spirit, are you too weary? And your spirit catches the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that's a thing that's got life in it. &gt;&gt; And your spirit catches the word of God. And that's the thing that has life in it. &gt;&gt; Don't let that be here. Don't let that thing, the word of God, be here without catching the life in it. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to see a tribulation, &gt;&gt; but it is coming. The world, the world is being set up right now. &gt;&gt; The pain and suffering that is taking place is indescribable. &gt;&gt; We're not here to try and talk about it, but it is indescribable. Your own human body, one single body can suffer pain and you have more pain and then they give you pain pills and then are you with me? &gt;&gt; And then you reach a level where the medication doesn't work &gt;&gt; and you're filled with pain and then if that pain increases you will actually go into unconsciousness. That's one body. Now just take the masses in the millions. And the pain's not only in the body. What about pain? What about the millions of children right now? Children, they're coming up from Mexico in the United States. They've come from El Salvador and they've come from all kinds from Central America. They're pouring across and the United States government doesn't know what to do. They're sleeping in big auditoriums right in Texas. on cold cement. They don't know what to do with them. Can't put children in jail. 9 years old, 10 years old, 11 years old. How much pain are those kids having? How much pain is in the world? How much pain is in Africa right now? How much pain is in Ukraine? &gt;&gt; How much pain is in Syria? Right. &gt;&gt; How much pain and then the world finally it crumbles under the intensity of these wars and this hatred and this fighting. Do you want to be here? &gt;&gt; Is this is this your world? &gt;&gt; For someone that doesn't want to go, I just say have a happy tribulation. You made your bed, sleep in it. &gt;&gt; And even if I didn't have a tingle of God in a service like this, I would say, "Oh, God." &gt;&gt; I would call out, "I wouldn't care who's beside me. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't care who's in the congregation. Oh, God, remember me." &gt;&gt; You think the thief on the cross was thinking about who's beside him or who cared what he said? He didn't care. He didn't care about the mockers. He didn't care about him. losing his garment to the people that were uh uh passing their what were they doing? &gt;&gt; Casting lots for his garment. He didn't care about anybody. Lord, remember me. &gt;&gt; When you come into your kingdom, &gt;&gt; what an answer. &gt;&gt; What an answer to a man who lived a life of treachery. &gt;&gt; Perhaps killed people. I don't know what he was. robber, a man of sin. Lord, remember me. And to hear the word today, today you'll be with me in paradise. What was that worth? That's worth all the shame and all the mockery and all the ridicule anybody else. You think he cared what anybody said? Nobody cared. He didn't care. He had one who cared today. Frankly, I don't care what anybody thinks. &gt;&gt; I want to hear two words. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want to hear two words. &gt;&gt; From that one who said today, &gt;&gt; and by God's grace, I trust I will be able to hear them. &gt;&gt; And I do not take it for granted. You say, "What are those two words? I want to hear well done. That's all I want to hear. &gt;&gt; Well done. &gt;&gt; I think of the woman that poured the ointment on him and they the disciples and the apostles and everybody were iate over it. What a waste. And he said, "Don't trouble the woman. She has done this for my burial." Burial. They didn't know anything about burial. Even though he told him burial, he said she hath done what she could. And I've made that a phrase for my life. I say that often. All I want to hear is you you did what you could. &gt;&gt; Can you give me just a few more minutes, please? In this atmosphere, I just want to finish just a very few minutes. This will set. Can I get that slide one more please? Don't read it ahead of me. Then we become a part of him as you are the veil that veils him. I want to stop there and have you look this way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're the veil. You know what you are? I'll put in today's language. You're undercover agents of the Holy Ghost. They've never figured me out. They've never figured you out because God has veiled you. And people are trying to figure out, you know, what makes him tick, what makes her tick, what makes him that way, what makes him dress this way or what makes them whatever. We sat in an airport for several hours determined to get on a South African airlines from one of the islands of the sea. I think it was Canary Islands, wasn't it? there off there someplace around the Canary Islands and in come this we waited four days and in came this big jet 747 South African Airlines landed there was a long space maybe from here to the door across the big open area of this air airport and there was a family came in after we were there and they were sitting on the other side they had three teenage children and a husband and wife and they were all busy and I was and we were waiting. There was nobody at the counters. So, we're waiting as soon as the girls got to the counter. I mean, I saw I was just watching cuz I'm nervous that way, you know, and I see a South African air airline girl coming up and I just up made a beline right for the desk. And I'm standing there at the desk like this. Some of you have heard this before, but it's very appropriate now. I'm standing at the desk and this woman, she made a beline also for the same counter and she's standing right beside me on this side and I could feel her pushing on my elbow. But you push all you want. I'm staying right here and she just pushed a little harder and a little harder and uh you know what few minutes later she was standing in front and I was off to the side and she just started she ranted on. She said, "We've been here. We've been We were put off of our flight. We've been waiting here and sitting in the motel or hotel and all of these cost everything else. We've got to be on this flight." And uh I knew the plane was loaded. So when we got to the I'll make this short. When we got to the waiting room, I got up there too and the 747 has a hump at the top and the first class is up there. some first class. So, uh, and my wife and I, we got, we were just two people and we got up in that hump. Don't don't don't don't feel that some something special. It was just packed with people and uh, just as we were coming up, we were right beside the same family coming up and they all had regular seats. But there was one first class seat and she says, "Oh, let me I've never been there." She said to the rest of her family, even three of her kids. And so she took the first class ticket and we all walked onto the plane all crowded. And then we go up that little spiral staircase up to the top. And man, she was up there and here's two nice easy seats right there facing each other, you know, swivel seats. And and I and my wife sat in one and I was just ready to dive in the other. And this woman dived in ahead of me and left me standing there and I thought, "Boy, she'd be beating me all the way along." So, I went and sat somewhere else. I thought about another eight hours of flying and I can't visit with my wife. So, I went and sat somewhere else and it was just packed with people. And uh I I got up and went to the washroom. And uh this woman said to my wife said, "What does your husband do?" She said, "He's a minister." She said, "Oh, I've been watching you all the time. We were in the airport. I was looking across that space and I was looking at you and she said, "Your face," he said, "you're so clean." I don't mean that you've just washed. said, "There's something. I've been trying to figure out what it is." Just think of it, friends. There I I had it in my heart. I'm going to get to that counter first. She had it in her heart. I'm going to get But if she's sitting there trying to figure something out, you know what she's trying to do? She's trying to see behind the veil. &gt;&gt; Say, "What makes this cleanness? &gt;&gt; What makes this woman this way?" My wife wasn't preaching. She wasn't praying. She wasn't reading a message book. She wasn't doing anything. She was just sitting there being a believer &gt;&gt; preaching a message to this woman &gt;&gt; and was able to direct her to message believers in South Africa. We don't know what happened but we did our part. &gt;&gt; You've been sent here &gt;&gt; in this aotted time &gt;&gt; to manifest a certain portion of word God has given you. Do you hear me? I'm not preaching a sermon. I'm giving you an announcement. God has given you a specific amount of word. All you have to do is believe the word that God has sent you. He will do the manifesting. He will manifest it in silence. He'll manifest it in music. He'll manifest it in word. He'll manifest it in preaching. Somehow he will manifest his word because it is him who's destroying the works of the devil. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's my message to you today, friends. &gt;&gt; I feel that's what God has sent me to this pulpit to do. Tell you you're here and this message is your allotted portion &gt;&gt; and the devil tries to come and take it away from us or tries to lessen it, tries to tell us it's not true. I deny that. I challenge him in the name of Jesus Christ. That enemy will be destroyed even for his thoughts in this way. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go and tell him who spoke to the people. You live in a certain place &gt;&gt; and you have you're praying for a certain person. It's your sister. No, it's not your sister. It's your sister-in-law. &gt;&gt; Tell this kind of thing. Tell the person who gave that wisdom &gt;&gt; that these things aren't so. &gt;&gt; And I want to say they are so, &gt;&gt; they are true. &gt;&gt; I want to declare it openly. You declared with your praise and thanksgiving to God. Thank you, Father, for having called me at this specific time. And I know you're faithful. You have allotted a certain word and just help me to live that. I give myself to the Holy Spirit. I will be a I will be a veil for the living God. &gt;&gt; Oh beloved Lord Jesus. We are so grateful, so thankful. I want to give you praise and thanks &gt;&gt; for the congregation, for the people, for those that are streaming, &gt;&gt; and those that may hear this at this time that of our rejoicing and this announcement of this is where we're at. Bless the people that have come up from Seattle or Victoria or wherever they are and those that have traveled to come here. They've waited in lines perhaps at the border. The children that came early. Lord, bless the children. Bless those that stood here. Oh God, bless our young men and young ladies. &gt;&gt; Within the school system, whether it be this school system, we thank you, Father. I see Brother Tatch here and his wife, Sister Shelly. Thank you, oh God, for star people. And I pray that you will embolden them, Father. And the teaching staff, oh God, the ministry that stands here, Father, and we hear them have spoken as Brother John spoke to the students, oh God. And I pray for those that are in the university, Lord, at SFU and wherever they may be, and in the further education, oh God, may they know this is only education to help them through this life. But we have another focus. We have another focus. We have another world. And this world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid up somewhere somewhere beyond the blue. We do not know where it is, but we know that it is nigh to us. Thank you for this message and messenger. Oh God, that passed into their realm. I'd like to say to this congregation in prayer, Father, this messenger that you sent, you allowed him to pass into that world that we're headed to. You gave us a taste. You gave us a foretaste like no other people of history &gt;&gt; because you gave it to the generation. This is our allotted portion. &gt;&gt; This is our allotted inheritance. And in the name of the holy one of Israel, the Lord Jesus Christ, I claim that. Oh God, may every believer, oh father, I pray that their spiritual life will be enhanced and there will be invigorated. I pray, oh God, there will be a cleansing wave for everyone that may be a sinner and unbeliever. Remove that unbelief even now. Oh God, &gt;&gt; may it startle them how quickly it leaves them. And let them have a heart of faith and belief in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory. &gt;&gt; For your glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sing it nicely. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through my And my eyes [singing] somewhere [music] beyond the angels [singing] [music] and I am [singing] worthy.
