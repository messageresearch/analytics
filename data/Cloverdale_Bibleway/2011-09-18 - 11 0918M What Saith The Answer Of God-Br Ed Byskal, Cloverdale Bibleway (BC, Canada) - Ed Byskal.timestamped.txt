[20:12] Hallelujah.
[20:15] Amen. Wonder Dad, brother Jim Hayes, if
[20:18] you would come and open the service for
[20:21] us in a word of prayer. We do have a
[20:23] request for brother Mark Pal. His
[20:25] father's in the hospital recovering from
[20:27] pneumonia and he needs a healing touch
[20:29] from the Lord. Just want to lift up our
[20:31] brother pal.
[20:33] And also a prayer request from our
[20:34] sister Elena Hendrickson. Please
[20:36] remember my boss's daughter Anna who has
[20:38] had chronic pain resulting from an
[20:40] operation over one and a half years ago
[20:42] was at a hip surgery that didn't go
[20:44] well. And we're just praying that this
[20:45] will be a way to speak further about the
[20:46] message. As Sena's boss is very open and
[20:49] receptive and Elena was just sharing a
[20:51] bit with me and it's amazing. I don't
[20:53] believe even where we work is an
[20:55] accident. God orders our footsteps.
[20:57] Amen. So, let's just remember
[21:01] this honor. Amen. Anything that's on
[21:03] your heart that you just like to lift
[21:04] before the Lord with an uplifted hand
[21:06] and dad, would you come?
[21:10] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[21:18] Amen. Let's just pray together.

[21:25] Lord, to have the desire in our heart,
[21:29] Lord, to assemble ourselves together,
[21:32] Lord. And how thankful we are to have a

[21:36] in this hour,

[21:44] desire, Lord. and how thankful we are,
[21:46] Lord, that
[21:49] you are able to fulfill those promises
[21:52] that you have given to us, Lord. And we

[21:56] able to finish the work and perfect the
[21:58] work that you began in each of us here,

[22:06] be one with you, Lord. It's according to
[22:09] your word, Father. And you've declared,
[22:11] and it's your very victory, Father. And
[22:14] how grateful we are, Lord Jesus, for it
[22:16] to acknowledge this truth and to be
[22:18] found in this hour with that desire in
[22:20] our heart, Lord. How we can have
[22:22] confidence, Father, to bring these
[22:23] petitions before you, Lord, because you
[22:26] said you supply all our needs in Christ
[22:28] Jesus. Lord, you promise that, Father.

[22:33] into that oneness, Lord. Enter into that
[22:35] perfect love with you, Father. You

[22:42] these requests that have been brought
[22:43] before, Lord, the confidence that they
[22:46] have in the body to present them, Lord,
[22:48] before you. And we just want to pray for
[22:50] these requests, Lord, that you meet
[22:52] these needs. You go to the specific
[22:54] situation, Lord God, and address them
[22:57] for your children that have brought them
[22:58] before you. How thankful we are, how you
[23:00] love us, Lord, and how you're mindful of
[23:03] us, Lord, and your your heart towards
[23:05] us, oh God. How wonderful to enter into
[23:09] that love for you and to realize your
[23:11] love for us, oh God. How grateful we
[23:14] are, Lord Jesus. How thankful we are,
[23:16] Lord. Bless your holy name, Lord Jesus.
[23:19] God, how we anticipate, Lord, your word
[23:22] this morning, Father, how we ask that

[23:27] Lord, for your spoken word, oh God. Just
[23:29] enable them to yield to you, Lord, and
[23:32] just flow through, oh God, and speak to
[23:34] our hearts and bring us, Father, that

[23:39] closer walk with you, Lord Jesus.
[23:42] Blessed be your holy name, oh God. Thank
[23:44] you for meeting these needs, Father,

[29:13] raindrops? What if your healing comes
[29:17] through tears?
[29:19] What if a thousand sleepless nights are
[29:23] what it takes to know you're near?

[31:07] [Music]
[31:10] When friends betray us,
[31:13] [Music]
[31:14] when darkness seems to win, we know the
[31:19] pain reminds this heart that this is not
[31:24] this is not our home.
[31:28] [Music]
[31:33] It's not our home. Oh,
[31:39] [Music]
[31:46] cuz what if your blessings come through
[31:50] raindrops? What if your healing comes
[31:54] through tears?
[31:56] What if a thousand sleepless nights? Or
[32:00] what it takes to know you're near? What
[32:04] if my greatest disappointment
[32:09] or the achings of this life is the
[32:13] revealing of a gater thirst
[32:19] can satisfy?
[32:24] What if trials of this life,
[32:28] the rain, the storms, the hardest
[32:31] nights,
[32:33] are your mercies in
[32:37] disguise?

[33:19] &gt;&gt; It's nice to see you all and some that
[33:22] are visiting.
[33:24] Brother Larry
[33:26] and Sister Darlene. Forgive me. I said
[33:30] Donna the other night. I'm sorry. God
[33:33] bless you. Nice to have you here.
[33:36] Daughter Sarah.
[33:38] Amen.
[33:40] And today is uh this evening is
[33:42] communion, the Lord's supper, foot
[33:45] washing. What a wonderful time.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; It's never been a disappointment.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; It's always a blessed time.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; And we're happy to have uh also our
[33:56] friends from Israel with us and uh all
[33:59] of you that have come up from Seattle,
[34:02] Tacoma to be with us. God bless you.
[34:05] We're so happy that you're here. Very
[34:07] happy. Always feels more like home.
[34:12] Amen.
[34:14] Uh well, I trust you're rejoicing
[34:20] &gt;&gt; tomorrow. I understand I just got an
[34:22] email that tomorrow we're going to be
[34:24] receiving the first uh young sister, a
[34:28] student from China for the school. She
[34:32] arrives tomorrow. So, I think quite a
[34:34] few of you perhaps got the got the email
[34:37] because she just is able to get on the
[34:41] aircraft with the things that she could
[34:43] carry and apparently be needing some
[34:46] things. So, Sister Shelley and Brother
[34:49] Terry were letting us know a little bit
[34:51] about that and we want to do all we can
[34:54] for for them. Incidentally, we got a
[34:57] lovely email from a pastor in Malawi and
[35:01] apparently they, you know, they've been
[35:03] pretty close contact. I don't I haven't
[35:05] met him, I don't think, unless maybe
[35:07] when he was a young man some years ago,
[35:11] but they have been following what has
[35:12] been taking place uh here at the church
[35:16] and with the school and it's exactly the
[35:20] same thing over there as it is here. He
[35:22] said it's just impossible
[35:25] to be able to put the children in the
[35:28] school system the way it is now.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; And he said we have been inspired by
[35:33] what we have seen and we are going to
[35:35] follow your example and we are going to
[35:38] put up a structure and a building for
[35:40] our children and they're just determined
[35:43] to keep them as protected as possible.
[35:46] And you know it's really wonderful. It's
[35:48] really wonderful when you It gives me a
[35:50] lot of joy to be able to say to Satan,
[35:53] you don't have them.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad today that we can
[35:58] say to the denominational system, you
[36:00] don't have them.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; We have them.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ has them.
[36:06] Wonderful. Amen.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; I want to also remind you once again
[36:09] that Brother Timuit
[36:12] will be here Saturday night, October
[36:14] 1st, and two services on Sunday, October
[36:18] the 2nd. So, that's coming up quite
[36:20] quickly. And we are uh really looking
[36:24] forward to having brother Tim and his
[36:28] family. I believe his family will other
[36:30] members will be here also because
[36:32] they'll be here for brother James and
[36:35] Sister Kathy Waldner's wedding. Brother
[36:38] James Morgan and Sister Kathy getting
[36:41] married on Friday the 30th and uh that
[36:45] is out at the camp. It's going to be uh
[36:49] uh I is that about the second one we've
[36:51] had out there? Is it?
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; These are special times. Whoever
[36:59] thought, Sister Kathy, you're going to
[37:00] get married out of the camp.
[37:06] Amen.
[37:08] So, that's wonderful. Be be really in
[37:11] earnest prayer for these. I I don't have
[37:13] time this morning. Uh we got a a long
[37:17] email report from brother Jonathan Larga
[37:20] who he and brother Alladen, brother
[37:24] Draamir and I think another brother,
[37:28] four of them went into uh Macedonia
[37:30] again and it is unbelievable.
[37:35] They just went from one brother to
[37:37] another to this pastor to another pastor
[37:40] to these people and where they had left
[37:42] message books before and they have had
[37:45] them and several people are uh are
[37:47] excellent translators and they have read
[37:50] the church age book and they're
[37:51] interested in translating and I just I
[37:54] just couldn't hardly believe what those
[37:55] four men did. And it all started they
[37:58] decided they were going to use Facebook.
[38:00] The devil uses Facebook, we'll use
[38:02] Facebook. So they went on, all these
[38:05] people started responding uh responding
[38:09] to them for message books and for uh
[38:12] different material. And so they went
[38:13] down there and loaded them up and then
[38:14] they went down now with another load.
[38:16] And it was marvelous, brother Mil. I'm
[38:18] sure you're rejoicing over that. Isn't
[38:20] he wonderful?
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I thought I'd like to
[38:26] just sing I just want to thank thee,
[38:28] Lord, for letting me hear your word. And
[38:32] then, Brother Mike Gier, I know we've
[38:34] had prayer. I'm going to ask you to come
[38:36] and pray uh before I read the scripture.
[38:41] If you do that, please. Let's stand as
[38:44] we sing.
[38:49] Just want to thank you, Lord,
[38:53] for letting me hear your word.
[38:58] Heat. Heat.
[39:04] [Music]
[39:08] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[39:14] [Music]
[39:18] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[39:22] [Music]
[39:28] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[39:39] What have I done?
[39:43] Glory.
[39:58] [Music]
[40:09] I just want to thank you Lord
[40:14] for letting me hear your word. Oh, what
[40:20] have I done to deserve such glory
[40:25] reveal?
[40:29] Thanks for that special.
[40:34] Then I saw you glorious
[40:39] face to face with eternal life
[40:44] for I.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Not even in my wildest dreams
[40:54] did I think I see such thing
[40:59] as the coming of the Lord. The rapture
[41:05] mystery.
[41:09] I have heard, but now I see.
[41:14] God is in my
[41:19] spoken word is the original seed. Oh
[41:23] Lord, I thank thee.
[41:29] Just want to bless your holy name. Oh
[41:32] God, we thank you Lord for letting us
[41:35] hear your glorious word. Oh God,
[41:38] surely what have we done to deserve such
[41:41] glory.
[41:42] Glory that was before the foundation of
[41:45] the world. Glory that was in you, Lord
[41:48] God. We're so thankful to be found in
[41:51] Christ Jesus. Truly, this world is not
[41:55] our home.
[41:57] Oh God, we're thankful that we're just
[41:59] passing through, Lord God, that there's
[42:01] a place waiting for us, Lord Jesus.
[42:05] Lord, we have tasted of the heavenly
[42:06] things, Lord. And we long not only for a
[42:10] temporary presence, a seating in
[42:13] heavenly places with you, Lord, but to
[42:16] eternally dwell with you there, Lord,
[42:18] where we were in you before the
[42:20] foundation of the world. Oh God, we
[42:23] thank you, heavenly father, Lord, that
[42:25] you've allowed us, Lord, to recognize
[42:28] our place, recognize this day in our
[42:30] message. Oh God, Lord, the revealing of
[42:33] Christ, Christ, the mystery of God
[42:36] revealed in us.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; What an amazing thing that we can
[42:41] declare with our whole heart,
[42:44] &gt;&gt; oh God, that we've never done it in the
[42:46] first place. What an amazing thing, Lord
[42:49] God. We look at the rich that we are,
[42:52] Lord.
[42:54] Oh Lord,
[42:57] you are so good, Lord Jesus. To believe
[43:00] all that the Father has done for us, oh
[43:04] God.
[43:06] Oh Lord, we claim our loved ones, Lord
[43:08] Jesus.
[43:10] Oh Lord Jesus, all the Father has given
[43:13] will come.
[43:15] None shall pluck them from your hands,
[43:17] Lord God. Lord, as we gather this
[43:20] morning, oh God, just to to worship you,
[43:23] Lord. And we're
[43:26] laying ourselves before you, thinking of
[43:28] those that once worshiped with us, Lord,
[43:31] and
[43:33] had foot washing. And oh Lord, we see
[43:37] them driving in opposite directions.
[43:39] Lord, we're all going to the same
[43:42] heaven. We all worship the same God,
[43:46] Lord. They're on our hearts. We are one.
[43:50] Father, we just remember them, oh God.
[43:52] And pray, Lord, you just draw us ever
[43:55] closer to you.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Draw us closer to each other, Lord.
[44:01] Break down the barriers, the walls, the
[44:03] petitions. Oh God,
[44:06] &gt;&gt; we love you, Father. We thank you,
[44:08] Father, for opportunity to worship you.
[44:11] Lord, it did my heart good to worship
[44:14] you, Lord. How I need to worship and so
[44:18] hard it is sometimes, Lord, to open our
[44:21] mouths and praise you, Lord. Truly, it
[44:23] is the sacrifice of praise.
[44:27] Oh God,
[44:29] &gt;&gt; bless us now, Lord, as we drink in not
[44:33] only from your word, but from your
[44:35] spirit. Bless our pastor, Father. bless
[44:38] our hearts to do what you say,
[44:42] things that the spirit would say unto us
[44:44] this day. I thank you in Jesus Christ's
[44:47] name. Amen.
[44:50] And I just want to thank you
[44:56] for letting me hear your word.
[45:01] [Music]
[45:03] I love to such glory revealing.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Lift it up now again.
[45:13] Thanks for that special night
[45:18] when I saw your glorious
[45:23] came face to face with eternal life.
[45:28] Lord, I thank you.
[45:33] [Music]
[45:34] &gt;&gt; I believe this the atmosphere God wants
[45:36] us to turn to the word.
[45:40] Actually, I woke up in the middle of the
[45:42] night two nights ago. God spoke to me
[45:45] and said, "Have brother D have brother G
[45:49] pray before you read the scripture."
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; And that's why we did it. It's nice to
[45:55] obey the Holy Spirit.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't the atmosphere nice?
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to receive the word?
[46:01] &gt;&gt; I'd like to have just little as movement
[46:03] as possible and just every bit every
[46:06] person's mind and thoughts on the word.
[46:08] But we're going to read out of the
[46:09] scripture out of First Kings
[46:12] uh the 19th chapter.
[46:23] We'll read verses
[46:25] verses 1 to four and then I want to read
[46:29] skip down to eight down to 18 and then
[46:33] we're going to read three verses four
[46:35] verses
[46:37] three four five verses out of Romans the
[46:39] 11th chapter
[46:45] and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah
[46:48] had done and with all how he had slain
[46:51] all the prophets with the sword
[46:54] Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto
[46:56] Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to
[46:58] me, and more also, if I make not thy
[47:02] life as the life of one of them by
[47:05] tomorrow about this time. And when he
[47:08] saw that, he arose and went for his
[47:10] life, and came to Beersa,
[47:14] which belongth to Judah, and left his
[47:16] servant there. And he himself went a
[47:19] day's journey into the wilderness
[47:22] and came and sat down under a juniper
[47:24] tree. And he requested for himself that
[47:27] he might die and said, "It is enough
[47:31] now, oh Lord, take away my life, for I
[47:34] am not better than my fathers."
[47:37] Then the eighth verse. And he rose and
[47:40] did eat and drink and went in the
[47:42] strength of that meat 40 days and 40
[47:45] nights unto Horeb the mount of God. And
[47:49] he came thither into a unto a cave and
[47:52] lodged there. And behold, the word of
[47:54] the Lord came to him and said unto him,
[47:57] What do thou hear, Elijah?
[48:00] And he said, "I've been very jealous for
[48:03] the Lord God of hosts, for the children
[48:06] of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
[48:08] thrown down thy altars, and slain thy
[48:11] thy prophets with the sword, and I, even
[48:15] I only am left, and they seek my life to
[48:18] take it away." And he said, "Go forth
[48:21] and stand upon the mount before the
[48:24] Lord." And behold, the Lord passed by,
[48:27] and a great strong wind the mountains,
[48:29] and beh and break in pieces the rocks
[48:32] before the Lord, but the Lord was not in
[48:35] the wind. And after the wind, an
[48:37] earthquake, but the Lord was not in the
[48:39] earthquake. And after the earthquake, a
[48:42] fire, but the Lord was not in the fire.
[48:45] And after the fire, a still small voice.
[48:49] And it was so when Elijah heard it that
[48:51] he wrapped his face in his mantle and
[48:54] went out and stood in the entering of
[48:57] the cave. And behold, there came a voice
[49:00] unto him and said, What do thou hear,
[49:03] Elijah?
[49:05] And he said, I have been very jealous
[49:07] for the Lord God of hosts, because the
[49:09] children of Israel have forsaken thy
[49:12] covenant, thrown down thine altars, and
[49:14] slain thy prophets with the sword. And I
[49:17] even I only am left and they seek my
[49:20] life to take it away. Yet I have left
[49:25] 7,000 is in Israel all the knees which
[49:30] have not bowed unto Baal and every mouth
[49:33] which hath not kissed him.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Paul is referring to this in Romans 11.
[49:42] He's referring to the same instance.
[49:49] And starting at verse one, I'm just
[49:51] reading five verses.
[49:58] I say then hath God cast away his
[50:00] people, speaking of Israel. God forbid.
[50:03] For I also am an Israelite of the seed
[50:06] of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
[50:09] God hath not cast away his people which
[50:12] he forneew. What know ye not? What know
[50:15] ye not what the scripture saith of Elias
[50:18] or Elijah? How he maketh intercession to
[50:21] God against Israel, saying, Lord, they
[50:24] have killed thy prophets, and dig down
[50:26] thine altars, and I am left alone, and
[50:31] they seek my life. But what saith the
[50:34] answer of God unto him? I want you to
[50:37] notice that Paul calls it, "What saith
[50:39] the answer of God unto him?" I have
[50:43] reserved to myself 7,000 men who have
[50:46] not bowed the knee knee to the image of
[50:49] Baal. Even so, then
[50:52] at this present time also, there is a
[50:56] remnant according to the election of
[50:58] grace.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. God bless you.
[51:10] I want to
[51:13] want to direct your thoughts and I would
[51:15] like you to really absorb
[51:18] if you would please the principle of the
[51:20] scripture
[51:22] to your own individual life.
[51:27] I feel very very impressed and directed
[51:29] with the word today. Not that we don't
[51:32] always but not sometimes just a little
[51:35] different. I want to speak to you on
[51:38] what saith the answer of God
[51:41] and also like two titles. What doest
[51:45] thou hear?
[51:47] In that time it was Elijah
[51:50] but this time it's us. What doest thou
[51:53] hear?
[51:55] The older testament the old testament
[51:57] account describes it in one way. The
[51:59] Apostle Paul describes it in another.
[52:02] What saith the answer of God? Actually,
[52:05] excuse me. Elijah didn't ask any
[52:08] question.
[52:11] Didn't Elijah didn't ask a question of
[52:14] God. He just told God of the
[52:16] circumstances.
[52:18] This is the situation.
[52:20] This is the way things are. The Israel's
[52:24] backsliden. uh people that believe the
[52:26] message are gone uh this way. It's
[52:29] cooled off and they've digged down the
[52:31] altars and they've cast them down and
[52:33] they've gone after different gods and
[52:35] and and and the circumstances and uh and
[52:39] now they seek my life also and my
[52:41] message is rejected. And that was the
[52:44] situation.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; And so he he didn't ask God a question
[52:49] at all. But God said to him, "I have
[52:53] reserved 7,000
[52:55] &gt;&gt; to myself which have not bowed the knee
[52:57] and has not kissed Baal."
[53:00] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul calls that the answer.
[53:03] What saith the answer of God?
[53:07] &gt;&gt; To uh to Elijah
[53:11] &gt;&gt; in the message, what does thou hear?
[53:15] Brother Brandham says these few words.
[53:19] And Elijah who was trying with a heart
[53:21] in him of God trying to show the people
[53:24] that God was still God and it had
[53:27] backfired on him.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; These are principles, friends.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Sometimes even though you may be the
[53:34] most fervent message believer and you
[53:36] may be cutting it right to the line and
[53:38] living it as devoted as you know how to
[53:41] live it and be a sanctified believer and
[53:44] do all that is right, it can backfire.
[53:47] Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; It backfired on Elijah. It backfired on
[53:51] the messenger.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; It backfired on men who have lived
[53:55] valiant and fought valiantly. But it's
[53:58] backfired on them. But it's then what
[54:00] happens when it does that? It backfired
[54:03] on him. And he ran out into the
[54:05] wilderness when he heard it. And there
[54:07] he laid under the juniper tree trying to
[54:10] find consolation.
[54:13] He sent his servants away and left him.
[54:16] And our story goes in three places. I'd
[54:18] like you to notice the three places.
[54:20] I'll refer to them a wee bit as we go
[54:23] on. Mount Carmel,
[54:26] &gt;&gt; that's where he had the great victory.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; That's where he slew the prophets.
[54:30] That's where fire came down from heaven.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; That's where supernatural things
[54:35] happened. That's where he restored the
[54:36] word and rebuilt the altar of God.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; At Mount Carmel. The next was under the
[54:44] juniper tree
[54:46] &gt;&gt; where he had ran to save his life and
[54:48] where he prayed, "Let me die. I'm not
[54:51] greater than my father's."
[54:54] That's getting fairly low.
[54:57] And the third place was a cave
[55:00] where God met him.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; And in the cave,
[55:06] in the cave, there's a a mighty rushing
[55:09] wind.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; But God's not in the wind. And there's
[55:13] an earthquake and God's not in the
[55:15] earthquake. Shook things down. And
[55:18] there's a fire, but God's not in the
[55:20] fire.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; But there's a still small voice. And
[55:24] brother Brandham says the cave that our
[55:28] cave is not Elijah's perhaps physical
[55:32] cave but you can go back perhaps into
[55:35] your memory and reach down into the uh
[55:39] resource of your soul down into the
[55:42] recesses of your inner being and become
[55:45] quiet before God and listen
[55:49] &gt;&gt; and see if he'll speak
[55:51] &gt;&gt; in a still small voice. That's why we
[55:54] often find the enthusiasm and we can't
[55:57] keep the enthusiasm. We're not here to
[55:59] pump the enthusiasm up.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; That's not the game. That's not it. The
[56:03] Mount Carmel's come and glorious times
[56:06] and victory, but you can expect there
[56:09] may be a a juniper tree experience and
[56:12] then God calls you to go back and he
[56:15] comes and meets you in your cave. When
[56:18] you give back into your own inner being
[56:21] and become quiet before God and after
[56:25] the fires passed and after the
[56:27] earthquake and the tempest that tried to
[56:30] shake your life to pieces
[56:32] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't successful
[56:35] &gt;&gt; and after the wind and after the fire
[56:37] and after the glorious things and after
[56:39] it died down and and after the
[56:42] earthquake, you found you're still
[56:44] standing.
[56:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; And then God allows you to go to a cave
[56:55] &gt;&gt; and that's quiet.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Then there's a mighty wind,
[56:59] &gt;&gt; but you realize God's not in the wind.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; There's an earthquake.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; There's trouble and God's not in it
[57:06] either. He just uses it. There's a fire.
[57:10] God's not in the fire. Then there's a
[57:12] still small voice.
[57:15] Hallelujah.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; And the voice was a question.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; What doest thou here?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; What are you doing with your focus on
[57:27] all these circumstances?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; They're true.
[57:33] This is happening. This is happening in
[57:35] the message. This is happening. This is
[57:38] happening in my family. This is
[57:39] happening. Oh, how how is the people
[57:42] backsliding and all these things? But a
[57:44] still small voice
[57:46] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't even didn't even address
[57:48] all those things. They might have been
[57:51] absolutely true. This is happening and
[57:53] that's happening and my friends and and
[57:56] whatever more all this is happening.
[57:58] That's not it. God still God.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; But the question was what doest thou
[58:06] here Elijah?
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Why are you here? Why are you consumed?
[58:10] Why is this so affected you?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Why do thou what doest thou hear? And
[58:17] then he the answer apostle Paul said the
[58:21] answer of God was I've reserved 7,000.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; 7,000. He didn't know another one.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; He didn't know any of the 7,000. God had
[58:32] 7,000. And I can tell you regardless of
[58:36] what you say, there is a spotless bride
[58:39] of Jesus Christ.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; And she's going to walk directly into
[58:45] the rapture.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; And there will be a rapture. There will
[58:49] be a marriage supper.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; But make sure that you're there.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; We can't be consumed and all taken up
[58:56] with all that takes place around us.
[58:59] There's something more happening.
[59:03] Hallelujah.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; God can be in the supernatural. God can
[59:09] be in the Mount Carmel. God can be in
[59:11] the great times when you just felt that
[59:14] you couldn't that you're going to be
[59:16] raptured yourself. You felt you're going
[59:18] to be carried away. And those times pass
[59:21] and uh then there's other things that
[59:24] come in. I'll come back to this in a few
[59:27] moments.
[59:29] And the and the prophet said, "It's very
[59:31] strange." He said, "You watch after your
[59:34] mount caramels, you're going to have a
[59:37] juniper tree."
[59:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Whenever whenever a man has a
[59:42] blessing and the power of God pours down
[59:44] and does something for you, look out,
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Sam." He said, "Satan's on the track."
[59:51] He said, "Just remember the next day,
[59:54] that Monday, after a good day on Sunday,
[59:57] it's going to be a hard thing because
[59:59] he's going to do everything he can to
[1:00:01] knock that confidence you out of you
[1:00:04] that the Holy Spirit instilled in you
[1:00:06] the day before."
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't take him long.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; The very next day, you have a wonderful
[1:00:12] day. Here we are today. What kind of a
[1:00:14] day will we have? Only God knows
[1:00:16] supernatural things happen. I can tell
[1:00:18] you this. Last week, I've seen the hand
[1:00:20] of God come down. I thought, "Oh, how
[1:00:24] glorious you are in battle."
[1:00:26] [Applause]
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Just incredible victories
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; that you'll no doubt hear about in the
[1:00:33] future, but it happens on a regular
[1:00:35] basis.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; When it seems like it's impossible, God
[1:00:38] comes on the scene and you know it's
[1:00:41] God.
[1:00:44] [Music]
[1:00:47] I don't even know whether I should say
[1:00:49] it, but our brother Toby and Sister
[1:00:52] Rebecca got called to the immigration
[1:00:54] department and it was just incredible.
[1:00:58] You don't know the circumstances. You
[1:01:00] don't need to know all the
[1:01:01] circumstances, but it's dead end at both
[1:01:03] ends. Totally dead end at both ends. I
[1:01:07] didn't remember exactly the prayer, but
[1:01:10] brother Toby said to Rebecca came into
[1:01:12] my office and two weeks ago week before
[1:01:16] last and we spoke together and they were
[1:01:19] had a big question about a very very
[1:01:21] major decision in their life and they
[1:01:24] and and brother Toby had said he prayed
[1:01:26] and he said whatever
[1:01:29] brother Ed says I take that as from God
[1:01:32] telling God whatever he says I take it
[1:01:36] as coming from God and and one is east
[1:01:39] and one is west and we had a
[1:01:42] conversation and we spoke and and he
[1:01:45] says I want a direct answer yes or no
[1:01:49] that's always hard
[1:01:51] and then we prayed and brother Toby said
[1:01:54] do you remember what you prayed I said
[1:01:55] not exactly he said you prayed let the
[1:02:00] person who makes the decision that
[1:02:03] person that makes the decision cause
[1:02:05] them to lay their hand on this file and
[1:02:09] they got a call within about two days
[1:02:12] and said, "I want to see you tomorrow
[1:02:14] morning at 9:30."
[1:02:16] And I can tell you the hand of God
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; move supernaturally
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; on their case.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Is that all right, brother Toby?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Here's here's how supernatural is. I'll
[1:02:31] I'll go this far. The person said
[1:02:37] addressed brother Toby said there's no
[1:02:40] possible way
[1:02:42] it's impossible for you under your
[1:02:44] status to have a work permit a work visa
[1:02:48] in this country.
[1:02:50] But she said all those files come to me.
[1:02:54] I'm the one that makes the decision and
[1:02:56] I'm giving you a work permit.
[1:03:00] [Music]
[1:03:02] Hallelujah.
[1:03:05] I say glory to God.
[1:03:09] And if this woman should ever hear this
[1:03:10] service, I'd say, "God bless you."
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; She heard the voice of God and did
[1:03:17] something. Isn't that marvelous?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; You have to understand some of the
[1:03:21] greatest things that happened, we can't
[1:03:22] mention to you, but I want to give glory
[1:03:24] to God. I go as far as I can over this
[1:03:27] pulpit, but believe me, friends, God's
[1:03:30] on the move.
[1:03:32] God is doing supernatural things. God is
[1:03:36] moving people and positioning things.
[1:03:38] And it's incredible when it seems
[1:03:40] there's no way out. God makes a way.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the heart of Elijah said
[1:03:47] that God is God.
[1:03:49] I say that that same God is present in
[1:03:53] this building today.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; That same God sent this message that
[1:03:58] you've embraced.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; So you be ready sometime after a
[1:04:05] glorious time there come a juniper tree
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; and in the same message what hearest
[1:04:11] thou Elijah? Brother Brandham prays. He
[1:04:14] said let us pray. Listen to his prayer.
[1:04:17] then you'll find out where he was.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh Lord, here they are.
[1:04:23] Forgive me, Lord. I didn't mean to say
[1:04:26] it like that. Here we are. Lord, just as
[1:04:30] true as I'm standing here, God, I
[1:04:32] believe that you're telling your church,
[1:04:35] you're calling your church into a cave
[1:04:38] now to speak to them. And Lord, it
[1:04:41] doesn't altogether have to be made a
[1:04:43] cave like the prophet hid in him. But it
[1:04:45] can be a little cave in in our memory.
[1:04:49] It can be a cave in our soul where we
[1:04:53] can move back, stop,
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; take inventory,
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; look around and listen
[1:05:02] and see what we can hear.
[1:05:06] Right,
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; friends.
[1:05:09] We need to do that.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; We need we must not be swallowed up with
[1:05:14] everything that happens from day to day.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; And in our association and amongst our
[1:05:21] friends and amongst our family and
[1:05:23] amongst the message at large or amongst
[1:05:25] the world or amongst your job or amongst
[1:05:28] your school or amongst your studies,
[1:05:30] whatever it is, we have to stop.
[1:05:34] go back in our memory.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; When you touched me,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; when you met me,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; when you called my name,
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; when you revealed yourself,
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; this message became so clear. I say,
[1:05:48] God, you're real.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; You're true.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Start saying it all over again. Start
[1:05:54] confessing the right thing. You're the
[1:05:57] author of this word. You're the author
[1:05:59] of this message. You sent this
[1:06:01] messenger. You sent them directly to me.
[1:06:04] You put that book in my hand. You sent
[1:06:06] that witness to me. And oh God, how
[1:06:09] great you are.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Go back in your memory.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Go back in your take inventory and look
[1:06:21] around and see what you can hear. Said,
[1:06:24] "We've heard the wind and we're grateful
[1:06:27] for it. We've heard the rushing winds.
[1:06:30] We've heard the roaring revivals. We've
[1:06:32] seen the miracles of Mount Carmel or
[1:06:36] we've seen the the mighty winds of Mount
[1:06:39] Baker
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; and we've seen the defeat and Lord, we
[1:06:43] have we're tired tonight. We're nervous.
[1:06:46] He's speaking of himself. Have you ever
[1:06:49] been there?
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Have you ever got felt tired?
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; You felt wear
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; God knows that
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; we're wearied. We're tired. We're
[1:06:57] nervous. and we need you.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; We're laying here under the juniper
[1:07:02] tree.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Feed us of thy truth.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you while he was
[1:07:06] under the juniper tree saying, "Let me
[1:07:09] die."
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; God had angels baking him food.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And on the strength of that food, he
[1:07:16] went 40 days.
[1:07:19] Hallelujah.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; While you're down in the pit and while
[1:07:22] you're at the very end of your rope and
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; you say, "I don't see any way out."
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; God has angels around you.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; He's got a messenger that has delivered
[1:07:33] a word. And if you open and listen to
[1:07:36] yourself, listen to your inner being,
[1:07:38] you'll find there's food right there.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go and find it. It's
[1:07:43] right there.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; You just turn around, the food's right
[1:07:46] beside you.
[1:07:48] and the drink.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; And on the strength of that food, and on
[1:07:52] the strength of that drink, he went many
[1:07:55] days till he got to a cave where he
[1:07:57] could hear the voice of God.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; The voice of God was an answer.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't even have a question. He was
[1:08:08] just telling the Lord, "Lord, this is
[1:08:09] the way it is. Lord, this is the way it
[1:08:11] is. I've been very jealous for you. I've
[1:08:13] been very faithful. I've I've done all
[1:08:15] that I can do. I've come to the service.
[1:08:18] I've done all I can for my family, for
[1:08:20] my children, for my brothers. I I I've
[1:08:23] done everything I thought I've been
[1:08:24] through. And I've seen the the I I've
[1:08:27] seen the altars
[1:08:29] tore down. I've seen the standards start
[1:08:33] to diminish. And I've been so troubled
[1:08:36] over it. Oh my.
[1:08:44] I told my wife
[1:08:46] the other day, I said, "I saw Pentecost
[1:08:50] go into a decline, into a steep decline,
[1:08:54] and I was a troubled young man
[1:08:58] sitting on a log
[1:09:00] looking into the face of Elijah
[1:09:03] with a thousand questions
[1:09:07] in my heart and soul. Oh God, what is
[1:09:10] the answer?
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "Have you have you heard the my
[1:09:18] message false anointed ones?
[1:09:22] Spring of 19 think about it now. Spring
[1:09:24] of 1961, May,
[1:09:28] last two weeks of May 1961. He didn't
[1:09:31] preach it till 1965.
[1:09:35] I couldn't have heard it.
[1:09:37] He hadn't been preached yet, but that
[1:09:40] what was going to come in 65 was the
[1:09:42] answer then. So he just went to the
[1:09:44] scripture.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Why? That messenger was in a timeless
[1:09:51] realm.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; I didn't even discover it for years
[1:09:54] later.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Didn't discover it like that. And the
[1:09:58] answer came from God.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Friends, in the midst of your dilemma,
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; the answer's right beside you.
[1:10:07] [Applause]
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:09] Right? When you can see no light at all,
[1:10:12] all darkness. We don't have to say
[1:10:13] there's light at the end of the tunnel.
[1:10:15] The light standing right beside you.
[1:10:19] Thank you,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; We heard the revivals
[1:10:25] were laying under the juniper tree. He
[1:10:28] said, "Feed us thy truth.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Thy word is truth. Yeah.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Take us from here this moment,
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Lord. Listen to the prophet's prayer.
[1:10:41] Take us from here, Lord,
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; to the cave,
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; and let us hide there in the cliff of
[1:10:49] the rock,
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; until we hear that still small voice.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; He concluded from his surroundings that
[1:11:02] he must be the only one. When you look
[1:11:05] at your surroundings, my friends and my
[1:11:07] brothers and sisters, and you come with
[1:11:08] a conclusion,
[1:11:10] one thing that I I feel assured that I
[1:11:13] can say in all truth, your conclusion is
[1:11:16] incorrect.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; This must be the way it is because I've
[1:11:20] looked at everything around me and I've
[1:11:22] looked at everything and that is true
[1:11:24] and this is all right. So it must be
[1:11:26] this. It's not that.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; It's not that.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; That's not the end of the road.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Are you Can you say amen to it?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; God was on Mount Carmel. God was under
[1:11:41] the juniper tree. God was at the cave.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What I'm saying here today,
[1:11:46] I don't care what your circumstances is,
[1:11:49] God will never leave you nor forsake
[1:11:51] you.
[1:11:54] So it covers the whole congregation
[1:11:56] today. Whether you're in your Mount
[1:11:58] Carmel and you're seeing supernatural
[1:12:00] things and having marvelous things and
[1:12:02] fire from heaven, I just say praise God.
[1:12:05] It might not be that way tomorrow
[1:12:07] morning. But if you're on Mount Carmel,
[1:12:09] praise God.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And then if you finally decided that uh
[1:12:14] you can scarcely live and you're you're
[1:12:16] at the end of the rope and you've got to
[1:12:18] give it all up and you're under your
[1:12:19] juniper tree, God's there.
[1:12:23] I don't care how low you are this
[1:12:25] morning. I don't care what your
[1:12:26] circumstances are. God's there.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Think about it, friends. God even gave
[1:12:34] life to the juniper tree.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; God knew Elijah was going to crawl under
[1:12:40] that one.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; God knew he was going to say, "Let me
[1:12:43] die.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; I'm the only one left.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; I've been faithful to the Lord and let
[1:12:49] me die."
[1:12:51] And there was angel. There was food
[1:12:56] already prepared for him. And I say to
[1:12:58] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:00] Christ, there's food that's already been
[1:13:01] prepared. It's called a message food.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's there's something
[1:13:07] exactly that is God's answer.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Answer of God doesn't always sound like
[1:13:13] an answer. But what saith the answer of
[1:13:16] God to you?
[1:13:21] The answer is a divine response.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; It's not what come from your friend or
[1:13:26] what you heard on the telephone. Forget
[1:13:28] the telephone.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; It's not what somebody texts to you.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; It's not what somebody put on some other
[1:13:35] social network for you. That's not God's
[1:13:38] method.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; God's method is the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:45] sometime coming not even through a
[1:13:47] ministry over the o over the pulpit but
[1:13:49] when you get back down into your inner
[1:13:52] being
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; and you ponder the work of God in your
[1:13:56] life and you have to come up with a
[1:13:58] conclusion that was God back there that
[1:14:00] was God here that was God's been in my
[1:14:03] life he's done things he has spoken to
[1:14:05] me and then just sit quiet and you'll
[1:14:07] hear another voice a quiet voice
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; still small voice
[1:14:16] a divine uh response, an oracle. And the
[1:14:20] oracle is something that the children of
[1:14:22] Israel believe came from the Holy of
[1:14:24] Holies.
[1:14:29] There are times when people cry out to
[1:14:31] God
[1:14:33] and they don't actually cry for anything
[1:14:35] specific. the children of Israel
[1:14:39] under the cruel hand of Egypt. They were
[1:14:42] crying out.
[1:14:44] They were crying out because of their
[1:14:45] burdens. They were crying out because of
[1:14:47] their task masters. No doubt mothers
[1:14:50] were crying out for their situation
[1:14:52] their children were born into.
[1:14:56] They were crying out to God.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; And God sends an answer. He sends the
[1:15:02] answer in the form of a deliverer.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He sent the answer in the form of
[1:15:07] a man.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; It was exactly what they needed,
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; but they didn't recognize what they
[1:15:18] needed. And often, and I'll come to it a
[1:15:20] little later, the prophet said God sends
[1:15:22] them exactly what they need,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; but it because it doesn't come in the
[1:15:26] way they want it
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; or the way they expected it
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; and because the very answer didn't come
[1:15:35] the way they had it figured out in their
[1:15:36] mind. So, let me tell you friends, don't
[1:15:38] figure it out in your mind.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Let God send the answer. Are you hearing
[1:15:44] me?
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Are you in agreement? Hallelujah.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; If you'll receive it,
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; God will do it something for you.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; A special a special visitation.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; So, what God sends is his answer, which
[1:16:00] is often rejected because it doesn't
[1:16:03] come the way that the people expect it.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; A little off the subject, but still
[1:16:09] relates. The first question that was
[1:16:11] ever asked was by the serpent.
[1:16:16] That's the first question. Adam and Eve
[1:16:19] never had any questions
[1:16:21] until after they listened to the
[1:16:23] serpent. The serpent asked the first
[1:16:26] question. Hath God said?
[1:16:32] And from that time the world has been
[1:16:34] filled with questions,
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; questions that are
[1:16:39] scarcely any answers for.
[1:16:42] And and there are no answers for a lot
[1:16:44] of people.
[1:16:46] But there are answers for the believer.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; There is
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; the answer of God sometimes comes in the
[1:16:55] way of a of a call. God may call and
[1:16:59] that is even his answer. So the Bible
[1:17:03] says, "And the Lord said to Moses,
[1:17:06] calling him when he was before the bush,
[1:17:09] and the Lord said, 'I have surely seen
[1:17:11] the affliction of my people which are in
[1:17:13] Egypt, and I have heard their cry."
[1:17:16] That's what he heard was a cry.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it may not even be something
[1:17:21] that's verbal. It may not be something
[1:17:23] that you even is vocalized.
[1:17:27] Have you ever been there
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; where you just grown?
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; I've been with people.
[1:17:39] I prayed with them
[1:17:43] when the cry was so deep they couldn't
[1:17:46] utter it. They couldn't find words
[1:17:49] and they just groaned.
[1:17:56] They fall to their knees and their face
[1:17:58] to the floor and they just oh
[1:18:02] there is no words.
[1:18:05] God God knows exactly the word
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; He can define that sound precisely.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And God heard you. I'm I know I'm
[1:18:18] talking to you because I know this
[1:18:19] message came directly from God. Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to be old.
[1:18:27] You don't have to be an old person. You
[1:18:28] can be a very young person.
[1:18:32] I don't want to give personal
[1:18:33] experiences, but things took place in my
[1:18:35] life and I just knew. All I knew is that
[1:18:37] this is terribly wrong.
[1:18:40] You have everybody and all your family
[1:18:42] and everybody tore away from you and
[1:18:44] you're you're you're there alone.
[1:18:52] And there's something set up inside and
[1:18:53] it just it's a it's a groaning. It's a
[1:18:56] it's a cry. And God said, I've heard
[1:18:58] their cry by reason of their task
[1:19:01] masters, for I know their sorrows.
[1:19:05] Come now, therefore, he said to Moses,
[1:19:07] and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that
[1:19:10] thou mayest bring forth the people, my
[1:19:13] people, the children of Israel, out of
[1:19:15] Egypt. And Moses asked, "Who shall I say
[1:19:18] sent me?"
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; He had a question. Who? Who? Who is
[1:19:22] sending me?
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Thus shalt thou say unto the children of
[1:19:25] Israel, I am?
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; I am that hath sent me unto you.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh asked, he had a question. Who is
[1:19:35] this Lord
[1:19:37] that I should obey his voice and let
[1:19:39] Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither
[1:19:41] will I let Israel go. Well, I can tell
[1:19:43] you in a few days, in a few days, he
[1:19:47] knew who that Lord was.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Why? Because his question was being
[1:19:53] answered.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; God Moses was God's answer.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; This is my answer.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; The serpent, the rod goes down. The
[1:20:04] serpent eats up the other serpents. the
[1:20:06] flies come and the frogs come and and
[1:20:09] all the things come and and finally
[1:20:11] death comes. He knew who God was
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; and he he knew it so well. He told him
[1:20:17] get away from here
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; because he knew he thought they were the
[1:20:21] source of his trouble when he himself
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; was the his idolatry and godless nation
[1:20:28] and even though he was a superpower
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; they were their own worst enemy.
[1:20:35] Friends, I hope you can read something
[1:20:37] in that.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; America's problems are from within.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Their problems are from within. Our
[1:20:44] problems in this country from within.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; It's not the bird on the outside. It's
[1:20:48] the worm at the core.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; It's the sin that's at the core of the
[1:20:56] nation,
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; corrupting from within.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; You can do everything you can to fix it,
[1:21:02] but it's Satan's Eden.
[1:21:04] Hallelujah. That's our answer.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; This is Satan's Eden.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; And you better believe it.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; That's the answer of God.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Who is this Lord?
[1:21:19] And God sends his answer.
[1:21:21] It's amazing. God sends his answer until
[1:21:24] Pharaoh recognized it. But the people
[1:21:27] had trouble recognizing it. Even the
[1:21:31] people that he delivered recognized it.
[1:21:33] and then they didn't recognize it and so
[1:21:36] I won't get into that.
[1:21:39] But then God God promised the answer to
[1:21:41] the sin question to the problem.
[1:21:45] He said the seed of the woman shall
[1:21:47] bruise the serpent's head.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; What is he talking about? He's talking
[1:21:50] about the answer.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; He's not even there isn't even a
[1:21:54] question yet, but he's giving the
[1:21:55] answer.
[1:21:56] And he said, "God, it it was another
[1:22:00] time in Israel
[1:22:02] when they were under great distress,
[1:22:05] crushed under the into the submission of
[1:22:08] Rome, under the cruel foot, under their
[1:22:10] cruel foot." And God sends the answer.
[1:22:13] And a prophet said in the breach, "The
[1:22:16] kinsman redeemer must be born of the
[1:22:19] human race."
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; And here that leaves us on a limb. But
[1:22:22] let me sound the trumpet to you. Here's
[1:22:25] a prophet sounding the trumpet to you.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; The virgin birth
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; produced
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; the virgin birth produced the product.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love those words.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; The answer to you.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, we wouldn't have a
[1:22:44] church full of people today if that
[1:22:46] answer hadn't come. No wonder they can
[1:22:49] say Christ is the answer and Christ is
[1:22:52] still the revealed message of the hour.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; People come to me and have asked that in
[1:22:59] my office and said, "Should we go to
[1:23:01] Christian counselors? Should we go to
[1:23:03] Christian psychologists?" I said, "They
[1:23:05] can help a lot of people, but they can't
[1:23:08] help you
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; because you have an answer that even
[1:23:11] goes beyond them. They're still asking
[1:23:13] questions
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; at the end of all of their psychology.
[1:23:17] They're still filled with questions. But
[1:23:19] when you have the answer and it works,
[1:23:22] you don't have a question anymore.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; How many people here have had the
[1:23:27] question answered?
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The craving of your soul.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:41] The virgin birth produced the product
[1:23:43] and the virgin birth produced our
[1:23:45] kinsman redeemer.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; None other. Listen who was the answer?
[1:23:51] None other but the almighty God became
[1:23:54] Emmanuel.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; One of us.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was met.
[1:24:02] Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Then the scripture says he came to his
[1:24:05] own and his own received him not. The
[1:24:10] answer came
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; the complete answer to the whole
[1:24:15] problem. The answer came. It didn't come
[1:24:18] in the way they expected it to come.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; And when the answer didn't come the way
[1:24:23] they wanted to come, they turned it
[1:24:25] down.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; He came to his own, but his own received
[1:24:29] him not. But as to many as received him,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:24:37] of God.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; The answer came to those needing
[1:24:45] answers.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; But they received him not. He said when
[1:24:48] all of them was crying for a Messiah and
[1:24:51] God sent them one but one wanted a
[1:24:55] general, one wanted an education machine
[1:24:59] and all so forth, but God sent them a
[1:25:01] baby.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; It might not come. It may come in a way
[1:25:05] that you'd even wonder. You couldn't
[1:25:07] possibly believe that this is an answer.
[1:25:11] Oh,
[1:25:12] if I could only tell you how God, he
[1:25:16] knows how to turn things around and
[1:25:18] God's wheels can turn very slow. We
[1:25:20] become impatient.
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; I looked back even this last week and
[1:25:31] recognized
[1:25:33] someone that was maybe met even years
[1:25:35] ago.
[1:25:37] You didn't realize it at the time. It
[1:25:39] was just a casual acquaintance. And many
[1:25:42] years later, God, you realize God set up
[1:25:46] that person and that contact so that
[1:25:49] that one would mention your name or
[1:25:52] mention something about the message over
[1:25:54] to someone else. And years later, then
[1:25:56] that contact is made again. And you
[1:25:59] realize this was God's network.
[1:26:02] [Applause]
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; I tell you, before there was ever an
[1:26:06] internet, God had his own net.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:09] Yes, sir.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; And we needed Elijah back there. We
[1:26:12] needed the tishbite.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; We needed him
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; on Mount Carmel. We needed him under a
[1:26:19] juniper. We needed him in a cave because
[1:26:22] that same life matches our experience
[1:26:25] today.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; We needed all of that.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Desperately.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; And you ought to be able to say, "Thank
[1:26:35] God for sending Elijah the Tishbite.
[1:26:38] Thank God for these men.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Thank God for David and what he went
[1:26:42] through. Solomon and these all these
[1:26:44] prophets. Thank God for the apostles.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Thank God for what they went through. I
[1:26:49] found myself there. Thank God for the
[1:26:52] messenger he sent today.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; That he was humble enough to say, "Oh
[1:26:56] God, I'm nervous and I'm I'm under a
[1:26:59] juniper tree."
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Then that doesn't make you feel so bad.
[1:27:06] Come on.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't dare ask.
[1:27:11] I'd like to find out how many are under
[1:27:13] juniper trees today. So, I want to chop
[1:27:16] it down.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; That's the way I feel. But maybe you
[1:27:19] need to be there for a little while.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Be there until you realize you just turn
[1:27:23] your head around. You find out there's
[1:27:25] some there's food for you right there.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; You'll get home this afternoon. Maybe
[1:27:29] just pick up a message book and you'll
[1:27:30] find out there was angel food already
[1:27:32] prepared.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:37] I'm talking about food that'll let you
[1:27:40] go on the strength of it for many days.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; We must not,
[1:27:52] there's a lesson now. We must not
[1:27:54] determine how the answer is supposed to
[1:27:57] come
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; because it'll come in a different way
[1:28:00] than what you expected.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:28:06] God hiding in simplicity says he came
[1:28:08] according to the word. But why didn't
[1:28:11] they why didn't they receive him?
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Because he didn't come the way they
[1:28:17] thought he ought to come.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; In Queen of Sheba,
[1:28:27] you're sitting very
[1:28:29] reverently.
[1:28:32] Listen by these next words.
[1:28:36] What would happen?
[1:28:39] Now the prophet's asking a question.
[1:28:41] What would happen if all the people that
[1:28:44] call by the name of the Lord if every
[1:28:47] one of them would rally around the great
[1:28:50] gift of God today?
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit. What would have
[1:28:56] happened?
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; He asked the question and what would
[1:28:59] take place?
[1:29:01] Right.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; What would take place if every bornagain
[1:29:05] Christian in Texas, he was in Texas,
[1:29:09] Dallas, where we will be in in November.
[1:29:13] What would happen if every born again
[1:29:15] believer in Dallas in Texas rallied
[1:29:18] around the gift of God?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Gives now the answer.
[1:29:23] Texas would be the most popular place in
[1:29:28] all the world.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; You say that was some
[1:29:34] that some exaggeration. No exaggeration.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; He was speaking of the possibilities.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; What he could see in God,
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; the spirit of Elijah
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; being rejected, the message being
[1:29:50] rejected. But what would happen if this
[1:29:53] place would receive the gift of God and
[1:29:57] everyone rally around that gift that God
[1:30:00] sent?
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; What would happen in this place? What
[1:30:06] would happen in the Pacific Northwest if
[1:30:09] every person I'm speaking directly to
[1:30:11] you, every man, woman, and child forsook
[1:30:15] your circumstances.
[1:30:17] Forget your juniper tree. Get back in
[1:30:20] your cave and hear the voice of God and
[1:30:23] hear the answer of God to this dilemma.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in your complaint
[1:30:31] about the message. I'm not interested in
[1:30:33] your questions about it. God will answer
[1:30:35] them as he needs it. I'm not interested
[1:30:38] in our little aggravations about one
[1:30:40] another or whatever more these little
[1:30:42] upsets. You know how long that will go?
[1:30:45] That will go on till you left this
[1:30:46] world.
[1:30:49] I'm interested in the answer of God.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; God has an answer for every one of your
[1:30:57] lives.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; And that answer is not some distant
[1:31:00] place. The answer is present here now.
[1:31:04] [Applause]
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; So I'm under a juniper tree. God made
[1:31:10] that juniper tree.
[1:31:12] God created the situation
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; so that you come to the place that maybe
[1:31:17] you'd call out to God
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; and he would it would give him an
[1:31:22] opportunity to come and answer you and
[1:31:24] speak to you.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And I say the answer is closer to you
[1:31:28] than you dare think.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; The answer's right beside you. God's
[1:31:31] already sent his answer
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; in the form of a message.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; That's not just some books on the shelf
[1:31:38] or some CDs or tapes. That's not what it
[1:31:40] is. It's the answer to the dilemma of
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Leodysia.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; And it will be our answer until he takes
[1:31:49] us out of this life and out of this
[1:31:51] mortal into immortality.
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Let me sound a trumpet. The answer
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; is here.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; The answer is in the sanctuary today.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's been effective.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; The answer has cut the shackles of sin
[1:32:15] and habits from you.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; The answer has changed the nature of
[1:32:20] many of you
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; from renegades,
[1:32:24] from rebellious people. The answer has
[1:32:27] changed you from religious fanatics to
[1:32:30] be a believer of the word of God.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; The answer is here.
[1:32:37] And the answers for everybody.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Not just those rejoicing. The answers
[1:32:42] for you
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; sitting there quietly in your cave.
[1:32:47] [Music]
[1:32:48] [Applause]
[1:32:51] [Music]
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt hear a still small voice.
[1:32:59] And after you have told all your prayers
[1:33:01] to God
[1:33:03] and you know that he heard you,
[1:33:06] his answer is going to come in the
[1:33:08] question.
[1:33:10] What doest thou here?
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; What doest thou hear?
[1:33:19] Why is your mind and your soul consumed
[1:33:24] with things that are of no avail?
[1:33:28] and no spiritual benefit.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; You young people, I speak to you, you
[1:33:35] have hopes for the future,
[1:33:38] things that you're going to do and going
[1:33:40] to be.
[1:33:42] Don't put your trust there.
[1:33:45] It may never happen,
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; but there's somebody that has the answer
[1:33:50] for every one of your lives.
[1:33:53] I can tell you God has an answer
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; for you.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:34:12] The answer is present friends.
[1:34:17] He's asking,
[1:34:19] "What are you doing here?"
[1:34:24] Well, I'm just standing firm as I know
[1:34:26] how. I've I've been so jealous for this
[1:34:29] word. I've been so faithful to this
[1:34:31] word. I've done everything I can for
[1:34:33] this word. And still, it gets worse and
[1:34:35] gets worse. No wonder the prophet he's
[1:34:37] went around the world and went into all
[1:34:40] of these places. My heart has been so
[1:34:41] touched as I read of the places he went
[1:34:44] and not not in a jet age
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; but in the time he was and the
[1:34:48] conditions he went into in in Africa and
[1:34:50] around the world and in India and these
[1:34:52] different places and then he says I come
[1:34:55] back and come back in the places even
[1:34:57] worse and they don't hear it and God was
[1:34:59] sending his answer but they maybe wanted
[1:35:02] it in a different way. They wanted it
[1:35:03] more eloquent or they wanted whatever. I
[1:35:05] don't know what the people wanted. I
[1:35:07] don't know what we all want.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; But we go on week after week and year
[1:35:12] after year and I can say what is it that
[1:35:15] you expect?
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; What is it that you desire? I can say
[1:35:19] one thing on the authority of God's
[1:35:21] word. The answer for your life. The
[1:35:24] answer that can make it absolutely a a a
[1:35:27] a glorious spiritual success. That
[1:35:30] answer is here with us. The food is here
[1:35:33] with us. Say, I have a long journey
[1:35:35] ahead. Eat up what God has prepared. Eat
[1:35:38] the food that God has given. Drink the
[1:35:41] drink that God has given. And you'll go
[1:35:43] as many days as you need to go.
[1:35:47] [Applause]
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Oh America,
[1:35:54] now he's addressing a nation. Oh,
[1:35:55] America
[1:35:58] tonight would rally. If America tonight
[1:36:01] would rally around the gift of God,
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; it would be a golden age,
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; it would be a millennium for us here.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; I want you to say a yay and amen to
[1:36:13] everything that you agree with in these
[1:36:14] lines. If we'd rally around the gift
[1:36:17] that God that the Holy Ghost, of course,
[1:36:20] all America would rally around the gift
[1:36:22] that God sent to us, the Holy Ghost, it
[1:36:25] would be a time that they would break
[1:36:27] down every wall of partition between
[1:36:30] Methodist and Baptist, between
[1:36:32] Presbyterian and Lutheran, between
[1:36:34] Pentecostal, and we'd have a golden age.
[1:36:40] And the power of God would sweep this
[1:36:43] nation from sea to shining sea.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Every nation under heaven would fear us.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. It was right
[1:36:54] there. The answer of God came in a
[1:36:58] little seventh grade educated Kuckian
[1:37:01] with a halting language, but the answer
[1:37:04] of God was right before them.
[1:37:08] Hallelujah.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; No wonder he would cry out and say all
[1:37:10] these tens of thousands and you can hear
[1:37:13] him in prayer. Oh God, why don't they
[1:37:15] hear it? Why don't they hear it?
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; When people see your lives and on the
[1:37:24] one side of they wish they could live
[1:37:25] that life on the other side of it, they
[1:37:27] find all kinds of fault with it.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; It's the devil.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; That's all it is. It's the devil.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; They know it's the right life. They know
[1:37:36] they they they admire you young ladies.
[1:37:38] They admire you families. They admire
[1:37:41] you men. They wish they could be like
[1:37:43] that, but the devil keeps them from it.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Is that not true?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Says, "And all Israel believed the gift
[1:37:57] that God
[1:37:59] and all Israel believed the voice of the
[1:38:02] sign.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Believe the gift that God give them. If
[1:38:05] America would just give believe the gift
[1:38:08] that God's given us these last days, his
[1:38:11] son in the form of the Holy Ghost raised
[1:38:13] from the dead living amongst us
[1:38:15] according to his promise. If we'd only
[1:38:18] cherish that.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; I don't want you just say, "I got to go
[1:38:23] to church."
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; But when you leave this place, I want
[1:38:26] you to cherish.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; I went back into my cave in that study.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. While brother Ryan was leading the
[1:38:34] service,
[1:38:36] I went back into the cave of my memory
[1:38:39] because the prophet gave me the words to
[1:38:41] get the access
[1:38:44] and I remembered when God did certain
[1:38:48] things and I knew it was God
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; and I thought I will just give him I'll
[1:38:54] give him glory once again and I thought
[1:38:57] I would just say something to him.
[1:39:01] I don't know. I don't understand a lot
[1:39:03] of things, but there's one thing I know.
[1:39:08] That presence. I didn't see you
[1:39:11] physically, but that presence.
[1:39:15] And I want to say this. If I would if
[1:39:17] I'd go into if I go into eternity in the
[1:39:19] next hour, I would want to have this on
[1:39:21] my lips. That presence, Lord Jesus, I
[1:39:24] know it was you.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And I love it.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; That's all I can say. I love it. And the
[1:39:31] words came out of my mouth. I was going
[1:39:33] to sing it. Maybe we will yet. My Lord,
[1:39:35] my Jesus, I love thee.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I know thou art mine.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; And for thee all the follyies of sin I
[1:39:43] resign.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; My blessed redeemer, my savior art thou.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Rally around the gift that God has sent.
[1:40:02] while someone is just able to make it a
[1:40:04] tradition or make it some kind of a just
[1:40:08] a a church formality.
[1:40:11] We don't want that.
[1:40:18] This great age of civilization, modern
[1:40:22] civilization
[1:40:24] has produced a nation of neur neurotics.
[1:40:27] Really
[1:40:29] great distress of this day and it causes
[1:40:32] them to cry out. You know what friends?
[1:40:34] It's not just believers that cry out.
[1:40:35] There's a lot of a lot of good people, a
[1:40:37] lot of people that don't go to church.
[1:40:40] They're crying out.
[1:40:43] They're pained.
[1:40:45] They want an answer.
[1:40:50] How blessed we are.
[1:40:53] And he said in investments, "What if
[1:40:55] people today that's praying for a
[1:40:57] Messiah
[1:41:00] and we're praying for a great something
[1:41:02] to happen?"
[1:41:04] He said there we Pentecostals. He was in
[1:41:07] Phoenix. And maybe he answers your
[1:41:09] prayer and you don't know it.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't receive it. If he
[1:41:14] answered it, it wouldn't come in the
[1:41:16] color that you prayed for. That's what
[1:41:18] they've always done.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; And if it come again, it would come in
[1:41:22] the same color. It would come in the
[1:41:24] same package. Just skip right over the
[1:41:27] top of it. In world falling apart, he
[1:41:29] said, "Now we find out that the world
[1:41:31] wants their own messiah. Russia wants
[1:41:33] theirs and the United States wants
[1:41:36] theirs. The church world wants theirs.
[1:41:39] Each one wants their own Messiah, but
[1:41:42] they want it in the way that they can
[1:41:44] control it.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; They want to have control over the
[1:41:48] Messiah.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; And if God would send it in their own
[1:41:52] taste, they certainly would accept it.
[1:41:55] But you see, then God knew their needs.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; He's not promised to send us our wants.
[1:42:01] It's what we ask for, but our needs.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; God knows what we need.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Back then, they needed the nation of
[1:42:09] Israel needed a baby.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; We needed a prophet in the end time. So
[1:42:15] much of the word was lost.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; The loose ends could never be put back
[1:42:20] together. Oh, how we needed a prophet.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; And it came with the first pull. And
[1:42:29] everybody rallied
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; around Mount Carmel.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; That kind of a showdown.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; There was no other ministry. Just think
[1:42:37] of it friends. No other ministry could
[1:42:40] demonstrate that. What a showdown.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; And would speak a message and they hated
[1:42:46] the message, rejected the message, would
[1:42:48] stand right there and start calling them
[1:42:51] out. And oh, how they loved that.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, they loved that. But after that
[1:42:57] mighty wind, then it changed
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; and start to reveal the very secret of
[1:43:02] their hearts.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; And after that mighty happening, then
[1:43:06] came
[1:43:08] the still small voice.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, brother Brandon got up
[1:43:14] and he preached and
[1:43:17] screamed out his message,
[1:43:20] poured out his soul," which he did.
[1:43:24] But after you long long after you leave
[1:43:26] a sanctuary like this, I pray that God
[1:43:30] will bring
[1:43:32] a still small voice to you and begin to
[1:43:35] speak to you.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; The answer came in our day, friends.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:51] You know our questions today
[1:43:54] and I hope I'm not considered to be
[1:43:58] fanatic but most of the questions that
[1:44:01] you have and I have many of the
[1:44:04] questions about today and the
[1:44:08] circumstances of our lives and so on
[1:44:10] have been created by the devil himself.
[1:44:14] And the reason I said that is so I can
[1:44:15] say this. In Christ is the mystery of
[1:44:18] God revealed. Notice speaking to you and
[1:44:21] I being personally identified by the
[1:44:25] original headship.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; We have the answer to the devil's
[1:44:32] question.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to have a dance.
[1:44:40] I don't care what answer, what question
[1:44:42] the devil has. We have the answer. I
[1:44:44] have Elijah telling me we have the
[1:44:47] answer.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; You know why I have such confidence as
[1:44:50] Elijah ministry? He been on Mount
[1:44:53] Carmel.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; He's been under the juniper. He's been
[1:44:56] in the cave. He's had all of those
[1:44:58] experiences. He come and tell us exactly
[1:45:01] what it is all about.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; I had never put those three together.
[1:45:05] I've never heard any other minister put
[1:45:06] those three together. Who did he put
[1:45:08] them together for? For you?
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; For me.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; I look in the face of sometime you young
[1:45:15] people. And and I I don't blame you kind
[1:45:17] of looking maybe a little bit distant.
[1:45:19] But I'm telling you, you'll remember
[1:45:20] what brother Biscll said. You'll be
[1:45:22] there someday.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; You'll reach that point someday.
[1:45:28] [Music]
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; What kind of a I'm not trying to be
[1:45:34] dramatic now, but what goes through
[1:45:35] people's minds? What goes through young
[1:45:38] teenagers minds when they go and hang
[1:45:40] themselves?
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; You think they find they've got a
[1:45:44] they've got questions,
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; big ones and no answers.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; They say life becomes hopeless.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; How can life become hopeless when they
[1:45:54] haven't even entered womanhood or
[1:45:56] manhood yet?
[1:45:58] I just mentioned the other day it's an
[1:46:00] it's national news in one of the in one
[1:46:03] of the uh uh native communities in
[1:46:07] Northern Ontario. They've had so many
[1:46:10] happen so quickly.
[1:46:13] What kind of a young man can have fame
[1:46:16] and fortune in the hockey world? And
[1:46:19] three of them in about one week I guess
[1:46:22] it was or two weeks. three of them in
[1:46:24] just a short time is taken take their
[1:46:26] own life.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the devil's got questions
[1:46:30] but no answers.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; I'm announcing to this congregation,
[1:46:34] everybody on the internet, this God has
[1:46:37] sent his answer.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care what dilemma you have. I
[1:46:45] don't care what question you have. God
[1:46:48] has sent his answer to this generation.
[1:46:51] [Applause]
[1:46:54] When you try to get an answer, what do
[1:46:56] you do? You think about it. Well, forget
[1:46:58] that because the headship, according to
[1:47:01] Elijah, the headship has come here.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; The head of the body,
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ. He said the
[1:47:11] headship.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; We have the headship. That's why we have
[1:47:15] the devil's answer. You don't know what
[1:47:17] the devil is devising. You don't even
[1:47:19] know what he might want to do tomorrow.
[1:47:21] But the head that has come to the bride
[1:47:24] knows exactly what he's going to do.
[1:47:27] [Music]
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; He said the devil.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; That's the reason he's howling the way
[1:47:39] he is. His wickedness has been He said
[1:47:42] his scheme has been uncovered.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Who uncovered it? Not some preacher
[1:47:48] behind the pulpit. The message of the
[1:47:50] hour. The answer came and uncovered and
[1:47:52] exposed him.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; He's had he's had his devices. He's had
[1:48:00] his all kinds of schemes for your life,
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; for your home,
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; for this church, for every bride church.
[1:48:09] He hates this message.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm so glad that this
[1:48:14] message has has given us a confirmation
[1:48:17] that he is defeated.
[1:48:20] And I'm rejoicing in his
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; defeat.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; And the prophet goes on. He's still in
[1:48:29] this. Listen what he says. He says, and
[1:48:32] this he's expressing and he says, "You
[1:48:33] think I'm beside myself? I'm not.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; We've got the devil's answer."
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; They thought he was beside himself. He
[1:48:41] was having such a glorious time. You
[1:48:43] think I'm beside myself? I'm not.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; We've got the devil's answer. That's why
[1:48:48] he was reacting the way that he is.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; You think I'm beside myself today? Not a
[1:48:53] bit. I'm so glad I can announce to this
[1:48:56] people, anybody that comes to hear me
[1:48:58] speak, we've got the devil's answer.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:49:06] [Applause]
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:12] He said, "It's not me that liveth, but
[1:49:15] Christ that the word living in me.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; It's not my idea. It's his power.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; It's not your scheme. It's not your
[1:49:22] idea. It's his power.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; If you didn't have that power in you
[1:49:27] today, I dare I dare even consider where
[1:49:30] you might be.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; God has held you.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; God has preserved you.
[1:49:38] I can say as Jesus said, Satan have
[1:49:41] desired to have you.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; But Jesus prayed for you.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; The messenger prayed for you.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; I have prayed for you and we have prayed
[1:49:50] for one another.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; What a defeat upon an enemy.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; When a son of God standing by the throne
[1:50:00] of God begins to pray and call a
[1:50:02] person's name,
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; said, "We've got the answer. Amen.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Christ is risen
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; and he's paid the price for our
[1:50:12] redemption.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; What God in Christ manifested, he gave
[1:50:17] that flesh and blood that in the blood
[1:50:20] might come the life and the flesh be
[1:50:23] redeemed
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; that that God in his redeemed flesh
[1:50:27] could manifest his word for the day as
[1:50:29] he did in that day. And he goes, "Woo,
[1:50:33] glory."
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Why are you speaking about what was
[1:50:36] happening right then? He wasn't
[1:50:37] rejoicing in the past. And I'm not
[1:50:39] rejoicing in just what he said. I'm
[1:50:41] rejoicing in what he said is alive and
[1:50:44] quickened in a people today.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Occasionally people have said, "Oh,
[1:50:57] brother Ed, you know, yeah,
[1:51:00] just amazed and you know,
[1:51:03] you just keep plowing forward.
[1:51:06] Hallelujah.
[1:51:08] Do you know what?
[1:51:11] Yeah, it's tough sometimes,
[1:51:17] but it's not that hard.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? There is no other way.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; There is no other option.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Just give me a couple minutes and I'm
[1:51:40] going to close.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; What do thou hear, Elijah?
[1:51:51] He said, "Mount Carmel's wonderful."
[1:51:54] He said, "You might be under the juniper
[1:51:55] tree
[1:51:57] and where you want to give up, but God
[1:52:00] has angel food prepared for you."
[1:52:04] I want to just give some titles here.
[1:52:08] Our cave or your cave experience.
[1:52:14] Another one, the Messiah in the message.
[1:52:20] You're thinking about it. Everybody
[1:52:23] wants a Messiah and they call for a
[1:52:25] Messiah.
[1:52:27] Russia wants a Messiah. America wants a
[1:52:29] Messiah. The churches want a messiah
[1:52:31] because they want somebody to come out
[1:52:33] and make them a spectacular organization
[1:52:36] or a superpower, spectacular country.
[1:52:39] They want to achieve. You're talking
[1:52:40] about they want to achieve and get to
[1:52:42] this get to the moon and get to the out
[1:52:44] into the universe and get space and
[1:52:46] achieve a great name in the world.
[1:52:49] That's not it.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; And we're not interested right here in
[1:52:57] this church. I speak for myself. I trust
[1:52:59] I speak for you. We're not interested in
[1:53:01] the name. I'm interested in one thing. I
[1:53:04] want to be an example to this glorious
[1:53:07] message. Want to live a life that's
[1:53:10] honorable and a credit to this message
[1:53:13] and do everything in our power with our
[1:53:16] with our united resources to get the
[1:53:19] word and get it out to some other people
[1:53:23] that someone else could enjoy what you
[1:53:25] and I are rejoining.
[1:53:27] Wouldn't
[1:53:30] you wouldn't it be a wonderful thing for
[1:53:32] you
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; just to be able to
[1:53:35] see someone else come out
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; from their terrible life of misery
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; and find out there was an answer to
[1:53:43] their life.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; The answer is Christ.
[1:53:51] In a still small voice,
[1:53:54] I just looked up the still, a whisper,
[1:54:00] calm whisper.
[1:54:05] God's great mystery.
[1:54:08] What the eternal God had as a mystery
[1:54:11] has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Then was given out down to his church.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was once in God's mind?
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Is this a quote or is this a reality?
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; What was once was in God's mind is now
[1:54:32] in the body of Christ. Jesus making love
[1:54:37] to the church, his bride, whispering his
[1:54:41] secrets to her. Amen.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Church,
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; we have heard
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; a still small voice.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Mine is in the still small voice because
[1:54:55] I'm rejoicing over it.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; But we've heard a still small voice.
[1:55:00] Many times there is no voice. It's just
[1:55:02] me in the scriptures or me with a
[1:55:07] message
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; or me listening to the prophet's voice.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. or me
[1:55:15] having nothing in front. You having
[1:55:18] nothing in front of you, no Bible in
[1:55:20] your hand, but the thing that you heard
[1:55:24] or a statement that was said. And when
[1:55:27] you get back in your cave and you begin
[1:55:29] to consider your life and your future
[1:55:34] and and the threats against you and
[1:55:37] whatever more and you hear something
[1:55:42] coming back, reverberating,
[1:55:45] the Holy Ghost has blown out the channel
[1:55:47] of your memory and you hear a voice
[1:55:50] coming to you. It is me.
[1:55:54] Be not afraid.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:56:00] That Messiah is here.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Not because I said it. And not because
[1:56:06] this church world says it. And not
[1:56:08] because only it's in the Bible, but what
[1:56:10] was in the Bible has been manifested as
[1:56:13] a living thing today. And that has said
[1:56:15] to me, that has made it quickened.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; I It is I
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; be not afraid. Hallelujah.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; It is I when everything seems that
[1:56:27] you're at the end of your rope at your
[1:56:29] end of your resources. And I know the
[1:56:31] pressure this day. I know that even you
[1:56:33] young people and you families, fathers
[1:56:36] with your responsibility. You come to
[1:56:38] places where you just you don't know
[1:56:40] which way to turn. Remember this.
[1:56:42] There's a still small voice
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; saying it's I
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; be not afraid.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:56:51] [Applause]
[1:56:52] Hallelujah.
[1:56:54] [Music]
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; The greatest thing, greatest favor you
[1:56:58] could do for me today is accept what's
[1:57:02] being preached.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Accept it. And the reason I say that is
[1:57:06] not for my benefit.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; It is for yours.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; I trust that you may receive it
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:57:17] Do you believe that God knew things from
[1:57:18] before the foundation of the world?
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Then he knew exactly that I was going to
[1:57:22] speak this and he knew exactly you were
[1:57:24] going to be sitting here.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; He had a plan. We're in God's plan.
[1:57:38] I don't know whether I
[1:57:41] in expressing my own self I express
[1:57:45] something that's in you
[1:57:47] but perhaps
[1:57:52] it's like there's a
[1:57:55] I find a cry
[1:57:59] within the hearts of the people.
[1:58:05] And the longer we live in the message,
[1:58:07] I'm I'm I'm just like I'm across your
[1:58:09] dinner table. I'm across the desk from
[1:58:11] you.
[1:58:14] We are reing and enjoy the message. We
[1:58:16] enjoy the body of Christ.
[1:58:19] But there's a cry
[1:58:22] within our hearts and and and and
[1:58:25] the cry may be
[1:58:28] it may result from different things. I
[1:58:31] go back just for a moment just to
[1:58:33] understand
[1:58:35] back in Egypt the mothers perhaps cried
[1:58:38] because they brought children. They saw
[1:58:40] their daughters and their sons under the
[1:58:42] weight of the task masters. So that
[1:58:44] might have been the source of their cry.
[1:58:46] The fathers perhaps cried because they
[1:58:48] weren't able to provide for their family
[1:58:50] and just had meager nothing. The young
[1:58:53] people perhaps cried because they why
[1:58:56] was I born in this family? Why why I see
[1:58:59] these Egyptians and they have, you know,
[1:59:01] a life of ease and relative. They're not
[1:59:04] being whipped. And and and the young
[1:59:06] people see their dad and how would you
[1:59:09] kids like to see your father under that
[1:59:12] kind of your mother lashed? This was
[1:59:16] reality. That's not a that's not a
[1:59:18] story. That's not a myth. They were
[1:59:20] whipped.
[1:59:22] And if you saw your mother and father, I
[1:59:24] want to put you there. and saw your
[1:59:26] mother and father being whipped with the
[1:59:28] lashes and work harder and make more
[1:59:31] bricks and push that load.
[1:59:35] So, they all had different reasons for
[1:59:37] their cry.
[1:59:43] I'm right down where you live now.
[1:59:49] Satan has been ruthless.
[1:59:52] He's torn at lives and he's torn at
[1:59:55] bodies and some have become racked with
[1:59:58] disease and sickness and affliction.
[2:00:01] Satan is in control of the economic
[2:00:04] system and you may be under the
[2:00:05] oppression of that. That may be one
[2:00:08] person's problem while it's not the next
[2:00:10] one. They might find it quite easy,
[2:00:12] relatively easy, but the other one just
[2:00:14] can't hardly find enough. I have people
[2:00:18] in this church,
[2:00:21] people in this church that's sitting in
[2:00:22] this church today
[2:00:24] told me that they've come to the table
[2:00:26] and didn't have food to put on the table
[2:00:29] because the the economics are so severe.
[2:00:34] What do you think that does to my heart?
[2:00:36] I just do anything and everything I can
[2:00:39] must be food on that table.
[2:00:42] They have their burden. They have their
[2:00:45] cry.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; They have
[2:00:52] some of you
[2:00:54] your homes.
[2:00:56] There's broken homes there.
[2:00:59] And there's a cry. There's a weight.
[2:01:05] There's a pain that no one can share.
[2:01:13] Everybody has their own cry,
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; but it was that cry that God heard.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; And those cries
[2:01:25] have been,
[2:01:29] they have been set up, they have come as
[2:01:33] a result of circumstances and situations
[2:01:37] in the world. And we could be saying
[2:01:39] like and maybe not even not even voicing
[2:01:43] it.
[2:01:45] Not even voicing it
[2:01:51] until God until there came an
[2:01:53] opportunity and God came and said,
[2:01:56] "What? What are you doing here?
[2:02:00] What am I doing here?
[2:02:03] I'm in church.
[2:02:06] It's Sunday. So I come to church,
[2:02:10] but when I go out of this door,
[2:02:14] I still have this pain. I still have
[2:02:16] this cry. I still have this problem. I'm
[2:02:19] still faced with this dilemma.
[2:02:22] And week after week, and I've I ran out
[2:02:24] into the desert myself. I just went out
[2:02:27] into the desert.
[2:02:29] And I'm in a very dry place.
[2:02:33] I found a juniper tree and I just laid
[2:02:35] there. I just wished I could quit. I
[2:02:38] wish I but I can't I can't somehow I
[2:02:41] can't give up.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; And you found that there was some
[2:02:46] strength you found and then God spoke to
[2:02:48] you and you found enough strength and
[2:02:50] you ate and you drank and said, "Oh, I
[2:02:53] heard I heard what the messenger said. I
[2:02:55] heard somebody say something over the
[2:02:56] pulpit. I heard a quote. I read a
[2:02:59] scripture and it gave me strength and I
[2:03:01] got up and I moved on.
[2:03:03] Hallelujah.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; And this morning
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; you're in your cave.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; God is having me tell you.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Many of you are in your cave
[2:03:17] and I'm telling you to forget all about
[2:03:19] the great expecting some great flash,
[2:03:24] some great thunder, some great wind,
[2:03:26] some great revival is going to shake the
[2:03:29] place to pieces. No, God's wanting to
[2:03:33] say something to you.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; I've been real jealous.
[2:03:44] I've wanted the best for my family. I've
[2:03:48] wanted the best for my brothers. I
[2:03:49] wanted the best for our church. I wanted
[2:03:51] the best for the bride of Christ. I just
[2:03:53] I've done everything. Sometimes
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not preaching it. I'm
[2:03:57] telling you my own testimony.
[2:04:00] Sometimes I just had to say, "Lord,
[2:04:02] I don't know what more to do. Give me
[2:04:05] strength in my senior years. Give me all
[2:04:07] the strength. Give me more energy."
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; All I know is wherever I heard it,
[2:04:12] people want to hear the message and they
[2:04:14] didn't have it. We're just doing
[2:04:15] everything. We're doing it even this
[2:04:16] last week. We just want I want them to
[2:04:19] be blessed with what I've been blessed.
[2:04:20] I want them to be able to read the
[2:04:21] masterpiece. I want them to be able to
[2:04:23] read I want them to be able to read
[2:04:25] these words.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:28] We've done all we can.
[2:04:32] I don't know if we have enough funds. I
[2:04:34] don't know if we have enough. We want to
[2:04:35] do what we want to do what we can for
[2:04:37] our children.
[2:04:41] I want to see you young people.
[2:04:45] I just want to see you have a Holy Ghost
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; teacher standing in front of you with
[2:04:51] the glory of God on their face. We've
[2:04:54] done what we can. Amen.
[2:04:58] But then there'll be a moment that you
[2:04:59] have to sit quiet.
[2:05:07] Ask yourself some very deep questions.
[2:05:12] Do I believe that this is true?
[2:05:16] Yes, I do.
[2:05:18] I believe that this is the only message
[2:05:20] that God ever vindicated like this.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. And if you ask yourself a few
[2:05:27] questions and give the right answer to
[2:05:29] it, you'll start to feel a strength
[2:05:30] coming back.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; And I believe there's a still small
[2:05:36] voice today.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; God is speaking to this congregation and
[2:05:43] to those on the internet congregation.
[2:05:47] What What do thou hear?
[2:05:54] You say, "Well, what do I do with these
[2:05:56] circumstances?"
[2:05:57] Then the Apostle Paul, his words come
[2:06:00] ringing through the centuries.
[2:06:03] Hear the answer of God to him.
[2:06:09] I reserved 7,000 others. Hear the answer
[2:06:13] of God to the bride of Jesus Christ. I
[2:06:16] reserved every elected.
[2:06:19] Not one shall be taken out of my hand.
[2:06:23] All that the father hath given me shall
[2:06:26] come.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Hear the answer of God,
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; and I shall not lose any of them.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Church, hear the answer of God.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; And our confidence and our rest is
[2:06:44] there.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; And I don't care where those people are
[2:06:47] today.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've prayed. I've been
[2:06:52] jealous. They haven't they haven't
[2:06:53] surrendered. They're still in their sin.
[2:06:55] They're still in that terrible
[2:06:56] condition. That's irrespective.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; That's irrelevant.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Completely irrelevant.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; We know who God is.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Congregation.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; If this isn't God, close the doors.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Everyone go home, eat, drink, and be
[2:07:16] merry. But this is if this is of God, he
[2:07:19] deserves everything that we have.
[2:07:26] Amen.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Give her your energy. Give her your
[2:07:31] strength. Give her your physical hours
[2:07:35] that you can help us. We've got We've
[2:07:38] got young people scattered throughout.
[2:07:40] Not only young people, we got people
[2:07:41] scattered. We're doing this building
[2:07:43] here is used from day to night, from day
[2:07:45] to day. It's a beehive of activity.
[2:07:48] We're sending the word out. Sister
[2:07:50] Debbie is making discs and tapes and
[2:07:52] I've got people who want t discs from
[2:07:54] the from the from the camp that we just
[2:07:57] had. They said, "We want to hear from,"
[2:07:59] can you believe it, that uh uh a service
[2:08:02] that was spoken at camp went from here
[2:08:04] to South Africa, and someone from South
[2:08:06] Africa called uh Brother Tom Brown in
[2:08:10] Ohio and and said, "We heard your name
[2:08:12] mentioned over brother
[2:08:16] Danny Steam's dad, heard the gospel in
[2:08:19] your front room." And he was outside
[2:08:21] rejecting it up to a certain time. and
[2:08:24] her and his mom was there and he was
[2:08:26] standing there as a young boy on the
[2:08:29] sofa hearing this message about five or
[2:08:32] six years old. Hello boys.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Five or six years old standing on a sofa
[2:08:39] preaching here years later with his own
[2:08:42] teenagers in the place and remembering
[2:08:44] where he heard this message.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; God is God.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; God know who he calls.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; God knows who he needs.
[2:08:54] Hallelujah.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad you're all here today.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; And you're here because I have
[2:09:04] confidence God is going to speak to many
[2:09:08] of you in a still small voice and he
[2:09:11] will he will pour in such a divine
[2:09:13] strength that the enemy's tactics will
[2:09:16] end up fruitless.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he'll end up defeated at
[2:09:21] your feet.
[2:09:23] This is the promise of God to his
[2:09:25] people. Rise in the name of Jesus
[2:09:28] Christ.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Rise and be victorious, oh army of the
[2:09:32] living God.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art
[2:09:41] mine. For thee all the follyies of sin I
[2:09:44] resign.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; My gracious redeemer, my savior, art
[2:09:48] thou? If ever I love thee,
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; my Jesus did. Now,
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; let's stand to our feet.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Father, we scarcely know what to say.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; And perhaps I don't need to say anymore.
[2:10:12] Your Holy Spirit will do the speaking,
[2:10:15] do the talking.
[2:10:17] Today we're getting ready for the
[2:10:19] communion.
[2:10:22] I pray, Father, you give us such a
[2:10:24] blessed day this afternoon as the people
[2:10:27] fellowship together.
[2:10:30] I pray that you'll give us a blessed
[2:10:31] time and may our hearts just be made
[2:10:33] ready and be prepared.
[2:10:35] I ask father that in this service and
[2:10:38] after service and this afternoon
[2:10:42] and this evening you'll choose a time
[2:10:46] and when people get next to themselves
[2:10:49] go back in the cave of their memory back
[2:10:51] in the cave of their soul get quiet
[2:10:55] before God and they'll look this way and
[2:10:58] look that way and listen listen
[2:11:01] we'll hear the answer of God to our soul
[2:11:06] Jesus, we love you.
[2:11:09] Do mighty things. Wash what needs to be
[2:11:12] washed by the water of the word. Wash
[2:11:15] every ill feeling.
[2:11:17] Wash every effect of the enemy. Wash, I
[2:11:20] pray, everything that's untrue.
[2:11:22] Wash, I pray, oh God. Wash every stain.
[2:11:25] Forgive us, Lord. Forgive me. Forgive us
[2:11:28] whatever we have said or thought wrong.
[2:11:30] Oh God, forgive us. We want to be washed
[2:11:33] so pure and holy for you're a holy God.
[2:11:37] We bless your name, Lord. We bless your
[2:11:39] name. We thank you, Lord. We thank you,
[2:11:43] Lord.
[2:11:47] My Jesus, will help me. My Jesus, I love
[2:11:49] thee. I know thou art mine.
[2:11:53] Jesus,
[2:11:56] I love
[2:11:59] thee. I know
[2:12:03] thou art
[2:12:08] for thee
[2:12:10] all the holies
[2:12:15] all
[2:12:18] my
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:23] graious
[2:12:27] redeemer.
[2:12:30] My savior

[2:17:42] gratitude and with thanksgiving to you
[2:17:44] for your divine presence that we have
[2:17:48] experienced here today, Father.
[2:17:52] Father, we thank you for the words of
[2:17:54] eternal life that we've heard from thy
[2:17:56] divine throne this morning.
[2:18:00] Heavenly Father, we are so thankful that
[2:18:02] you're conscious of those times, Lord,
[2:18:06] when we find ourselves in the caves of
[2:18:08] our minds.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; In those places, Father, where it's very
[2:18:13] difficult to tread. In those places,
[2:18:16] Father, where you alone can meet us and
[2:18:19] know, Father, the burdens.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:18:23] where you where you meet us in the
[2:18:25] conditions of our beings, Father, where
[2:18:29] there is no more strength in us to carry
[2:18:31] on, Father, but we've heard, Lord,
[2:18:34] you've provided a way, Lord. You've made
[2:18:36] a way of escape. You've provided food,
[2:18:38] Lord, in due season where we can eat and
[2:18:41] be strengthened in the inner man,
[2:18:43] Father. And oh God, how we are so
[2:18:46] thankful today that you've given us the
[2:18:48] answer, Father. Father, we are so
[2:18:51] thankful that the good news of the
[2:18:53] gospel has been preached to us today.
[2:18:55] Father, that the enemy is destroyed. His
[2:18:58] eminent destruction has happened, oh
[2:19:01] God.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can rejoice, oh father,
[2:19:06] because we have heard from your divine
[2:19:09] throne, oh God,
[2:19:11] that you will not lose one in your holy
[2:19:14] mountain. That none is able to pluck us
[2:19:17] from your hands today, Father. There is
[2:19:20] no conditions of life, oh God, that will
[2:19:22] take us away from you.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Father, for the word that
[2:19:28] we've heard this day, oh God. It's it's
[2:19:30] life into our bones this morning, Lord.
[2:19:34] It's the strength that we've called for,
[2:19:37] Father.
[2:19:38] Lord, I can testify today that what's
[2:19:41] been preached, Father, is a cry of my
[2:19:43] own soul that you've heard, Lord. And I
[2:19:46] know that by speaking that which you've
[2:19:48] spoken today that you've heard the cry
[2:19:50] of each and every one of your children.
[2:19:52] Lord,
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; thank you for the answer. Father, thank
[2:19:58] you, oh God, for the strength that
[2:20:00] you've given us today. Thank you for
[2:20:02] this divine power that has come to
[2:20:05] energize our faith, Lord, to go forward
[2:20:08] and to claim the victory, Father.
[2:20:12] Hallelujah.
[2:20:14] Father, we thank you this morning, Lord.
[2:20:18] Father, we are empowered in the inner
[2:20:20] man, Lord. We are supercharged, Lord,
[2:20:23] and we believe your word today, Father.
[2:20:26] We believe you have spoken, Lord, and we
[2:20:29] believe that we are more than able, oh
[2:20:31] God, to overcome by divine revelation.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to our God. Glory be to
[2:20:44] Jesus this morning. Father, we lift you
[2:20:47] up on high, oh Lord. We crown you with
[2:20:50] praise and adoration this morning,
[2:20:53] Father. Oh, Father, how thankful we are
[2:20:57] this morning, that we have a God with
[2:21:00] the answer, Father. We have a God who is
[2:21:03] fearless, Lord. We have a God who is
[2:21:06] able to do the exceedingly, the
[2:21:09] abundantly above all we can ask or
[2:21:11] think. Father,
