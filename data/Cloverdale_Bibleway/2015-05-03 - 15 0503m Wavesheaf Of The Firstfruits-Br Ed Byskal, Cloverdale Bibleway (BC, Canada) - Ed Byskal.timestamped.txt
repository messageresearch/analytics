[1:06] Heat. Heat.
[2:25] It's okay.
[3:54] Do you?
[4:11] Like a lost lamb, I was dreaming.
[4:18] I was
[4:20] also helpless and alone.
[4:27] What the seeking shepherd he found
[4:33] me
[4:37] to do my father's home
[4:41] and I sing glory
[4:45] glory
[4:46] hallelujah
[4:55] we bless
[4:58] foreign
[5:00] the great
[5:10] we'll sing the first verse together now
[5:15] my heart and soul
[5:22] by the mighty chain the
[5:31] free.
[5:35] Has he set you free this morning? He set
[5:38] me free. Worship him. I sing glory,
[5:44] glory, glory,
[5:47] glory.
[5:49] Oh, hallelujah.
[5:52] Blessed
[5:54] be holy name.
[6:00] He
[6:03] master
[6:09] the
[6:11] redee.
[6:13] Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.
[6:26] is
[6:32] the great
[6:46] and the church said, "Amen. and you love
[6:49] the Lord this morning. Looking forward
[6:51] to a wonderful day in his presence. It's
[6:53] good to have each and every one of you
[6:54] here with us this morning. Those on the
[6:57] internet and the telephone hookup, we
[6:58] certainly want to take a moment and
[7:00] greet you and trust that the same
[7:02] presence that's here is translated to
[7:05] wherever you are this morning. Amen. I
[7:08] know a little bit about that. We
[7:11] appreciate your love and appreciation
[7:13] and affection towards myself, my family,
[7:17] and the family of God. in each other's
[7:19] was a testimony I'd like to start the
[7:21] service out with this morning. You know,
[7:24] God doesn't miss one little detail.
[7:27] Yesterday, I was absolutely distraught.
[7:29] I thought I had a a setback in my
[7:32] project that we're working on at the
[7:33] camp. And uh it happens Saturday
[7:36] afternoon and I just you know you you
[7:38] have plans and you have it kind of paced
[7:40] out and you know how things are going to
[7:41] go and then it doesn't and it kind of
[7:44] sets you back a little bit and you say
[7:46] you know now this is going to cost and
[7:48] this is time and energy. And the very
[7:51] next day I was talking to a brother that
[7:54] was at the camp and he said oh I I know
[7:57] somebody that does stuff like that. I
[7:59] said you do? Oh yeah. you know, and
[8:02] within an hour, and he doesn't he didn't
[8:05] know what was going on. I mean, he's not
[8:07] even a believer, doesn't attend the
[8:08] church. Within an hour, he stopped by
[8:12] and said, "Oh, I make those things. You
[8:13] need a couple of those?" I said, "Do I
[8:16] need a couple of those?"
[8:18] And just minutes, minutes, monumental
[8:22] problems fade,
[8:25] fade away. Amen. God is good.
[8:30] That was just my little thing. Sister
[8:33] Leah Brryer said, "I would like to
[8:34] publicly thank the group of young people
[8:36] that came and worked all day yesterday
[8:38] doing landscaping and yard cleanup at my
[8:41] home, especially Brother John Andes and
[8:43] Jessica Caldwell. That might be Jessica
[8:46] Andes, who got the ball rolling and
[8:48] organized what became literally a
[8:50] backyard missions project. I'm extremely
[8:52] grateful for all their hard work and
[8:55] sacrifice, their own plans. My yard
[8:57] looks beautiful and was a real answer to
[8:59] prayer. It seemed like God dropped a
[9:01] group of angels right into my home. May
[9:04] God pour out his blessings back into
[9:06] your lives. God doesn't miss anything.
[9:10] Amen. Another testimony I can read this
[9:12] morning. Uh this is from Sister Victoria
[9:14] Adamorea. The Lord did a marvelous
[9:16] miracle last Sunday morning service
[9:18] while brother Tim was preaching.
[9:20] Specific requests made were answered
[9:23] exactly. I came to church that day
[9:25] terribly sick. Towards the end of the
[9:27] service, I was instantly healed to date.
[9:30] I love him better every day. Thank you,
[9:32] Lord. Thank you also for the ministers.
[9:35] Amen.
[9:38] I think we can just give the Lord a
[9:40] great thanks this morning. Hallelujah.
[9:47] Hallelujah.
[9:48] He does all things well. We want to also
[9:51] remember Sister Sammy Keane today in our
[9:54] prayers. She's at home sick with
[9:56] bronchitis,
[9:59] but we're looking forward to the
[10:00] deliverer to come once again this
[10:02] morning. Why don't we sing together?
[10:04] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[10:06] There's statements in this song and then
[10:08] there's answers. What can wash away my
[10:11] sin? Question. Statement. Nothing but
[10:14] the blood of Jesus. Amen. We'll sing it
[10:17] just like that this morning.
[10:19] What can wash away my sins? Nothing but
[10:25] the blood of Jesus.
[10:30] What can make me whole again?
[10:35] Nothing but the blood.
[10:38] Oh pre
[10:45] that makes me wide as snow
[10:54] bound I know nothing but the blood.
[10:59] Oh my pardon. Oh my pardon. This I see.
[11:06] Nothing but the blood of Jesus
[11:11] for my cleansing
[11:14] I plead. Nothing but the blood.
[11:21] Oh, precious is that
[11:28] makes me wide as
[11:33] no other bound by
[11:38] nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[11:43] Nothing can for sin at home.
[11:48] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[11:53] How good I have done. Nothing but the
[11:59] blood of Jesus.
[12:03] Oh
[12:06] my god.
[12:17] I know. Nothing but the blood.
[12:24] This is all my hope and peace.
[12:32] Hallelujah.
[12:34] This is all my rightous
[12:43] singing. Oh pre
[12:55] no other found.
[13:00] Nothing but the blood. This is all my
[13:04] hope. This is all my hope and
[13:10] nothing.
[13:14] This
[13:16] is all my rightous.
[13:24] Halleluah.
[13:26] Oh
[13:29] my
[13:34] god.
[13:47] I know the master of the wind.
[13:52] I know the master of the wind.
[13:59] I know the fer
[14:12] you made the sun shine again.
[14:19] Eyes on the master of the wind. My boat
[14:25] of life.
[14:28] My life
[14:32] sails on a tr
[14:37] there
[14:40] in my
[14:43] but my heavenly father.
[14:49] Oh, he watches over me.
[14:56] turns into
[14:58] a game.
[15:02] And I know I know that
[15:12] I
[15:24] make the sun shine again.
[15:32] master.
[15:37] Oh, sometimes I'm
[15:42] like an eagle in the sky
[15:46] among the peace. My soul can be found.
[15:55] What an unexpected
[15:57] storm.
[15:58] It may drive me from the high.
[16:03] It may bring me low, but it'll never
[16:07] bring me down.
[16:09] Are you glad about that this morning?
[16:12] I know the master of the wind.
[16:25] Halleluah.
[16:27] Hallelujah.
[16:29] We can calm the storm. He'll make the
[16:33] sun to shine again.
[16:38] I know the master of the wind.
[16:47] I know the master of the wind.
[16:55] I know.
[17:03] He can promise
[17:06] the sun to shine again.
[17:12] I know the master of the way
[17:19] sometimes.
[17:21] Halleluah.
[17:27] Sometimes praise
[17:30] the Lord.
[17:35] Some of times gently
[17:38] singing
[17:43] our hearts in one
[17:46] of
[17:51] Sometimes
[18:17] all this lifted up again.
[18:21] of mine.
[18:23] Hallelujah.
[18:50] is here.
[18:54] Hallelujah.
[19:04] Amen.
[19:18] Give us
[19:36] your name.
[19:43] intense touch.
[19:47] You will never
[19:53] for
[20:13] Holy,
[20:14] holy,
[20:17] I will let
[20:20] you
[20:29] listen closely.
[20:32] I hear I hear
[20:36] my name.
[20:49] Maybe we can all stand this morning
[20:51] together. Oh, just lift up your hand to
[20:54] him now. He's here.
[20:58] Hallelujah.
[21:03] He is here.
[21:06] What a confession this morning. He is
[21:12] holy,
[21:14] holy.
[21:17] I will I will let you
[21:30] spit
[21:34] out
[21:36] your name.
[21:39] He is here.
[21:51] the same is real sweet. Now he is
[21:59] what you need this morning.
[22:12] is
[22:16] holy
[22:21] blessing
[22:25] for he
[22:28] is
[22:32] There's a single
[23:01] You can touch him.
[23:04] You will never
[23:07] be
[23:09] the same.
[23:13] Hallelu.
[23:15] With every eye closed,
[23:18] every heart bowed,
[23:22] we want to remember Sister Sammy Keane
[23:24] this morning.
[23:26] If you have an unspoken request on your
[23:28] heart,
[23:30] he is here.
[23:33] Maybe it's something that you mentioned
[23:35] in prayer last night and said, "Lord,
[23:38] I'm going to church in the morning with
[23:40] this on my heart. I need you to speak,
[23:43] Lord. I need you to deliver.
[23:45] Need you to set free that which is
[23:47] bound."
[23:49] We want to be challenged by the word
[23:51] this morning to take him at his word.
[23:55] Brother Tim, would you come this
[23:56] morning, God, and just open the service
[23:59] this morning in prayer,
[24:08] wonderful heavenly father,
[24:13] Lord, in the sweetness and the humility
[24:16] of this atmosphere that's here this
[24:18] morning, oh God, we humble ourselves
[24:22] before you, the great and mighty God who
[24:25] made heavens and earth, Lord,
[24:29] that Lord, if we would go by human
[24:31] understanding,
[24:32] it would be unreachable for us to touch
[24:35] you.
[24:36] But Lord, we're not going by our own
[24:39] understanding. We're going by faith.
[24:42] That you have made yourself available to
[24:44] us this morning that we might touch you.
[24:48] that we might never be the same as the
[24:51] song has said. That we might enter into
[24:53] your presence with no matter what our
[24:56] needs are and what our burdens are.
[24:59] Lord, you're here to meet each and every
[25:01] need. You're here, Lord, to give the
[25:03] answer. You're here, Lord, to solve the
[25:06] situation. You're here to lift burdens.
[25:09] You're here to break chains. You're here
[25:12] to loose the captives. Oh, God. No
[25:14] matter what the situation is, Father,
[25:16] there's nothing too hard for you. You
[25:20] are a mighty God, Lord. So, thank you
[25:23] for the testimonies that we heard this
[25:25] morning, our sisters, oh God, that you
[25:27] touched. And Lord, we heard this week
[25:30] from the saints in the PAL. Thank you
[25:33] that you were with them and not one of
[25:36] their lives were lost. And Lord, you did
[25:39] supernaturally spare the believers in as
[25:42] they prayed in the church during the
[25:45] earthquake. Lord, you did a miracle and
[25:49] spared the building even that it might
[25:51] not fall upon them. Lord, we give you
[25:54] glory for that. We give you praise. And
[25:58] Lord, we know the same God that was
[25:59] there in Nepal. The same God that was in
[26:02] the Philippines when the tidal wave came
[26:05] in and spared the saints in the church.
[26:08] We are the saints of the living God
[26:10] gathered together once again this
[26:12] morning and the miraculous is possible
[26:15] amongst us today, Lord. And so we pray
[26:18] that you will just move especially on
[26:20] the scene. Sister Sammy couldn't be with
[26:23] us this morning, but Lord, you're the
[26:25] God who's omnipresent.
[26:27] Lord, may you be with her where she is
[26:29] get watching even right now. Bless her
[26:32] in her mortal body. Strengthen her,
[26:34] Lord. Others that couldn't be with us
[26:36] streaming this morning, bless them, oh
[26:39] God. And Lord, as we look to you this
[26:42] morning for the ministry of the word, I
[26:45] pray, Father, that you will anoint our
[26:47] pastor with a special anointing.
[26:51] Lord, that you will speak to us through
[26:53] the gift this morning. You've done it so
[26:55] many times. You are so faithful. And
[26:59] we're asking, Lord, once more that
[27:01] you'll come on the scene. Once more,
[27:03] Lord, bless your people. Once more,
[27:06] Lord, meet our individual needs. Oh
[27:09] Lord, we call you on the scene in the
[27:11] name of Jesus Christ. Lord, as we even
[27:14] would take up the offering this morning,
[27:17] I pray, Father, that you'll bless it. We
[27:20] might have a little to give. Whatever we
[27:22] have of our substance, we don't give it
[27:25] as being of our own strength. We give it
[27:27] as maybe the boy that had five loaves
[27:30] and a couple fishes, Lord. Lord, we had
[27:33] just a little to give, but Lord, you
[27:35] multiplied it, increased it, and fed a
[27:38] multitude. And Lord, may you use our
[27:40] offering this morning for your glory. We
[27:43] give it to you as worship, Father. And
[27:45] we ask your blessing upon every part of
[27:47] this service in Jesus Christ's name.
[27:51] Amen.
[27:55] Amen. Amen. Why don't you have your
[27:56] seats this morning?
[28:01] We'll sing. If that same spirit that
[28:03] raised Christ from the dead dwell in
[28:05] you, it'll quicken your mortal body.
[28:08] Amen. God bless you.
[28:11] How many were able to listen to It Is
[28:13] the Rising of the Sun during the week or
[28:15] this last night? Amen. There's a lot in
[28:18] there. I don't I don't have any idea
[28:20] where brother Ed could go.
[28:23] It's loaded. Huh, brother Tom? It's
[28:25] loaded.
[28:27] Yes, sir.
[28:29] But we want that same quickening spirit
[28:31] to dwell in us responds back to the
[28:33] word. Word speaking to the word this
[28:35] morning. If that same
[28:39] spirit that raised Christ from the dead.
[28:44] Oh, sing it now. Where do you
[28:49] get that same
[28:53] right from the dead?
[29:04] Your mortal body.
[29:09] That spirit dwell in you.
[29:13] It shall witness
[29:16] your body.
[29:19] If that
[29:23] is true,
[29:25] we'll sing that again. We've uh we got a
[29:27] special this morning and I want to give
[29:29] them plenty of time to get up here. It's
[29:31] uh the grandchildren of our brother
[29:33] Derek Donaldson from New Zealand,
[29:35] Timothy, Manuel Estelle and Jamai and uh
[29:39] I believe it's the Stevens. Is that
[29:41] right? All right. So, you guys come on
[29:43] up. Whoever's singing with that group,
[29:45] we've got everybody right. Come on up
[29:46] and get ready. We'll just sing this
[29:48] through another time or two while
[29:50] they're getting ready. If that same
[29:53] spirit
[29:57] will you
[30:03] give that same
[30:05] feeling that face from the dead
[30:11] willing you
[30:16] got wicked
[30:18] your mortal body
[30:21] is that spirit
[30:24] dwell in you.
[30:27] It shall witness
[30:30] your whole body.
[30:33] If that spirit
[30:36] dwell in you,
[30:39] it shall quicken
[30:42] your mortal body.
[30:51] It shall break
[30:54] your body.

[36:08] take. He needs as much time as we can
[36:11] give him. Amen. Why don't we sing
[36:13] Blessed Assurance. This is my story.
[36:16] This is my song. As our pastor comes
[36:18] this morning, we're certainly in
[36:20] anticipation what the Lord will say to
[36:22] our hearts this morning. Not just uh in
[36:26] the soul realm. We want fruit. You know,
[36:29] it's one thing to be planted by the
[36:31] river. It's another thing to bring forth
[36:33] fruit. Lots of trees. We want to be
[36:36] those that bear good fruit. Amen. Let's
[36:39] sing this together as our pastor comes
[36:40] this morning. Blessed assures.
[36:52] Oh, what a
[36:55] taste of glory.
[37:06] I've been purchased of God
[37:12] for his
[37:18] blood.

[38:36] in my soul. Glory.

[39:48] we?
[39:50] Gracious and loving heavenly father,
[39:54] we're desiring one thing today and that
[39:56] is that you will be lifted up, exalted,
[39:58] and glorified.
[40:01] Not what man will desire, but what you
[40:04] desire.
[40:05] And Lord, we want your will above our
[40:08] will. We say, "Thy will be done on earth
[40:11] as it is in heaven." God, may we lay
[40:14] aside every personal thought and every
[40:17] personal ambition.
[40:19] We pray that we will lay aside all of
[40:21] those things that we might just seek, oh
[40:24] God, to know you in the fullness of the
[40:28] revelation. And may we step into that
[40:30] channel of revelation today, we pray.
[40:33] Open your word, oh God. Anoint the
[40:36] hearers, anoint the speaker, we pray.
[40:39] Anoint all of those on the internet. I
[40:41] pray oh God whether near or far or the
[40:45] archive services however you should
[40:48] desire to do it we just pray that you
[40:50] will bless it in the name of Jesus
[40:53] Christ we surrender ourselves to you now
[40:57] amen and amen
[41:00] the people said amen
[41:03] uh I'm going to just have you have your
[41:05] seats for a moment and uh because I have
[41:08] a couple of things I'd like to make you
[41:11] aware of. Uh
[41:14] there's a brother that he may not be
[41:16] streaming right now, but his
[41:19] his name is Brother Neville Rodriguez,
[41:22] and he is the son of the pastor
[41:26] Fabriiono in Brazil, Typico, Brazil. He
[41:32] was the first brother that invited uh
[41:34] myself there some years ago. Uh but he
[41:38] has he's a man that's just like he's
[41:40] eaten up with a passion and a desire to
[41:44] get the message to someone else. Uh as
[41:47] you probably know, Brazil speaks
[41:50] Portuguese
[41:51] and so he feels closely connected to
[41:54] Mosmbique and Angola over in Africa. So
[42:00] he has made many many many trips to
[42:03] Mosmbique over a lot of years and today
[42:07] as we sit here he's in Angola again.
[42:10] He's been in Angola several times. I
[42:12] don't know how many times. I know he was
[42:14] there at least once or twice before. Uh
[42:17] but he's there today. And his son
[42:20] Neville has asked us to remember him in
[42:23] prayer. Neville is not uh uh he's uh not
[42:28] just a young man as such. He's married,
[42:31] has several children and lovely wife and
[42:35] children. Uh he asks us to remember them
[42:38] in prayer. And so I would uh I don't
[42:41] want that just as a a phrase, you know,
[42:45] remembrance in prayer. And I think of
[42:47] the world how often they say our
[42:49] thoughts and prayers are with you. And I
[42:51] just wonder if that's really true. You
[42:54] know, everybody has their thoughts and
[42:56] prayers with you. Well, it's a little
[42:58] more than that. I want to I I I received
[43:03] um also an uh an email from him
[43:07] yesterday. We've been communicating back
[43:10] and forth quite a bit. I've known him
[43:13] I've known Neville for a lot of years as
[43:15] well, and he he has done some
[43:18] translation work. not translating of the
[43:21] message but he'll interpret uh for
[43:24] visiting minister his dad is a pastor of
[43:26] the church there and so that's where I
[43:29] met him uh for the first time he works
[43:31] in a bank and so he speaks really quite
[43:35] good English
[43:36] um and uh he he saw he saw a message
[43:42] just a title of a message that uh I
[43:44] preached I think in 2010
[43:48] and uh you will remember those of you
[43:50] that were here it was entitled the
[43:52] wounded word that was earlier and then I
[43:55] think about 2010 the the value of a flaw
[44:00] and he thought those were such strange
[44:01] names so he just passed over them he
[44:03] didn't bother to hear them and then
[44:08] different events were taking place in
[44:10] his life and and so on and he thought I
[44:13] I'll go and listen to that uh service
[44:17] the wounded word. He said that he was so
[44:21] deeply affected. He was so sobbing and
[44:25] broken
[44:26] and to realize that he was a part of
[44:29] that. And uh he said that he was so
[44:34] affected he listened to it again and
[44:36] then listened again and each time it
[44:39] seemed the Holy Spirit was just doing
[44:41] something in his life. So it it kind of
[44:44] rippled out from there and uh he was so
[44:47] affected they played it in the church.
[44:50] They have a church which uh when I was
[44:52] speaking there probably 1,500 to 2,000
[44:55] people in their church and uh
[45:00] he said it was such a blessing in the
[45:02] church. Then other ministers heard about
[45:04] it and other people heard about it and
[45:07] said we would like you to come and play
[45:09] that service in our church. So that's
[45:12] what he's been doing and he's been
[45:14] writing back to me and saying and then
[45:16] he said then I thought I would listen to
[45:19] the value of a flaw because that was
[45:21] connected that was the service uh just
[45:24] before just after and I I don't recall
[45:27] the order of them but he listened to
[45:29] that and uh right now as of as of we
[45:34] sitting here you think of something
[45:36] archived maybe two years ago an
[45:39] atmosphere in the service here and
[45:41] however God was speaking to the people
[45:43] here. I think it's just wonderful. I was
[45:46] thinking of the uh thinking of the
[45:49] course uh I'm so glad I'm a part of the
[45:52] family of God. I think that is so
[45:55] wonderful. And then uh we I got also
[45:58] word from uh brother Busabos and who's
[46:02] been communicating with brother Tim
[46:04] because of the work that is going on in
[46:08] Ethiopia. Brother brother Bus, we call
[46:11] him brother Bus, but brother Busaboosei
[46:14] who's from Uganda had gone to Ethiopia
[46:16] with his family and he had to return
[46:18] because he needs to get a new passport
[46:20] and that's why I'm bringing it to you.
[46:24] uh they they've tightened things up very
[46:26] very tight because of ISIS and because
[46:29] of the um I would say extremists that
[46:33] have come into Ethiopia and have have
[46:36] beheaded and killed some Christians. Uh
[46:39] and uh and so you know the Bible says in
[46:43] as it was in the days of Noah, the Bible
[46:46] says in the days of Noah that the earth
[46:48] was filled with violence
[46:51] and there was only evil in the in the
[46:53] thoughts of man on a continual basis.
[46:56] And we're there. We're there. No, nobody
[46:59] has an answer to it. And no government
[47:02] has a control of it. And nobody no
[47:05] border can keep it all out. And so this
[47:08] is what's happening and because of
[47:10] what's happening in in Ethiopia and
[47:12] other countries in northern eastern
[47:16] Africa
[47:17] uh they have made it very very tight for
[47:20] brother Basaboosei to get another uh
[47:24] visa. In order to get a visa, he's
[47:27] written over here. They require that
[47:29] they get all of our documents,
[47:32] our articles of memorandum, our
[47:34] incorporation.
[47:36] And uh so we send them all over there
[47:39] and it seems that now they want the
[47:42] government to notoriize. First they want
[47:44] them notorized and now it seems that
[47:46] they want the government to notoriize
[47:48] them. I don't know if the government
[47:50] even does notoriize documents, but it's
[47:53] just a tightening up and a tightening up
[47:56] and a tightening up. It's just making
[47:58] more difficult. And in order for him to
[48:01] remain there, and here's a a a group of
[48:04] people. There's been about 15 or more
[48:07] recently baptized, I would say, in the
[48:09] last what about a year.
[48:12] It's in September. And when he was
[48:15] leaving,
[48:17] they said to him, and this is a book of
[48:20] Acts, friends, this is not a story. This
[48:22] is a book of Acts. And they said to him,
[48:25] "Are you leaving us now? We can't go
[48:28] back to these
[48:30] dead churches and denominations. How can
[48:33] we go back?" And are you leaving us? And
[48:36] he said it just broke his heart. And uh
[48:39] and and one of the one of the most
[48:42] fervent
[48:44] young women that has opened more doors
[48:47] was a young woman that was following him
[48:49] and another brother as they were walking
[48:52] down the street cuz they were witnessing
[48:53] and doing different things and and she
[48:56] was beckoning to them and calling them
[48:59] and calling them and they just kept on
[49:02] going without paying any attention. And
[49:04] one said to the other, uh, there was one
[49:06] calling in the New Testament, I think,
[49:08] to Paul, maybe we should turn around and
[49:10] and speak to her. And they turned
[49:12] around. She was a prostitute
[49:15] which was seeking to offer herself to
[49:18] these two young men. And so they turned
[49:22] around and preached Christ to her. She
[49:25] gave her heart to Jesus Christ. She has
[49:28] become one of the most fervent and
[49:30] followers of this message in Ethiopia.
[49:34] I say praise God. Nothing is beyond him.
[49:38] And this is a reality friends. This is
[49:40] an absolute reality. God bless all the
[49:44] believers in Ethiopia. God bless those
[49:47] in Kenya that have gone there and those
[49:49] believers that are there and established
[49:52] there. We don't know of many, but I know
[49:54] that the message is going there. and
[49:56] let's pray that brother Busaboosei will
[50:00] be able to get the necessary documents
[50:03] for him and his family to be able to
[50:05] stay there. And he said he was so last
[50:09] Sunday he was so aching and so burdened
[50:14] and uh
[50:16] he got on FaceTime.
[50:19] I don't know what you do with FaceTime.
[50:21] I've been on it maybe once with the
[50:22] family, but he got on FaceTime and
[50:25] preached a whole service. He said, he
[50:28] said, "I preached a complete service to
[50:31] the f to the saints in Ethiopia." He
[50:33] said, "It was wonderful."
[50:35] I said, "Praise God. God knows how to
[50:38] use all of these, you know, toys.
[50:42] They're not toys for some a worker or a
[50:44] laborer. So, praise God for that." And
[50:47] then he had just met a scholar. He met a
[50:49] man. He said a very fine man. He was a
[50:52] he was he was an absolute scholar of the
[50:54] scriptures and he just loved God. He was
[50:57] so so given over to the scriptures and a
[51:01] very humble man and very rich in his uh
[51:06] Christian experience but he was seeking
[51:09] more. So brother Bessaboosei gave him a
[51:11] church age book. He said yeah he said he
[51:15] he read that. He said, "Uh, now I've
[51:18] heard truth that I've never heard
[51:19] before." And so, Brother Buster Boise
[51:22] then went on to the hub and brought down
[51:25] some messages and printed them for him
[51:27] and handed them those messages. And he
[51:29] was so delighted to get some. And then
[51:32] there were some other folks that needed
[51:34] some messages. So, he went up in the hub
[51:36] and and got those. And I don't know was
[51:38] another language or what it was, but he
[51:41] he printed those out and handed them to
[51:44] that body of believers. I'm so glad we
[51:48] can have a part. Amen. Amen. And that's
[51:52] that's just the beginning. I mean,
[51:55] you have to pray they'll get around to
[51:57] preaching.
[52:00] Then we get word out of Switzerland and
[52:03] uh Sister Angela Michel and brother
[52:06] Gerard Michel. Brother Gerard, he has a
[52:09] painter doing some renovating in his
[52:12] house and he gets witnessing to him and
[52:15] uh and he speaks another language. He
[52:17] speaks Portuguese. So he he went up on
[52:19] the hub and brought down Portuguese
[52:21] language and printed him some and said
[52:23] here, you know, so he walked away with
[52:25] those. He was paint. He went to paint
[52:27] the house and walked away with some
[52:29] Portuguese messages. I say, "Praise be
[52:31] to God." And then Sister Angela went out
[52:34] for a walk and there's a place my wife
[52:37] could tell you about it. She said, "It's
[52:39] just so picturesque. It could only fit
[52:42] in Switzerland, just pastoral." And and
[52:45] there was a shepherd with a flock of
[52:48] sheep. They were waiting to cross. He
[52:50] they were waiting for the gate to enter.
[52:52] And he when he opened up the gate, he
[52:55] said, "Those sheep just shot across
[52:57] there." And and uh uh but they have
[53:00] confidence in in what the shepherd is
[53:02] doing. And uh so sister Angela was
[53:05] walking there and here was a shepherd.
[53:08] And so she started talking to him
[53:11] and he said, "What's happening in the
[53:13] world? What's happening? This just a
[53:16] shepherd
[53:17] hurting sheep in Switzerland." But he
[53:20] said, "What's happening in the world?"
[53:22] They said this
[53:24] sick some problem. She said well you
[53:28] know God sent a messenger. God sent a
[53:30] prophet to us. Said you just just stay
[53:33] here and I'll run home and get a message
[53:35] for you. So she went home and went on
[53:38] the hub and printed why it had to be
[53:39] shepherds
[53:43] and came back and handed him that
[53:45] message book. So the shepherd's reading
[53:47] why it had to be shepherds. and I just
[53:49] said, "I'm so glad we're apart."
[53:52] Hallelujah.
[53:57] We've got a couple slides out of uh out
[54:00] of Angola where brother Fabriiona is
[54:03] right now. And so I just want to show
[54:05] those to you. Maybe we could dim the
[54:07] lights. And uh I just these are just
[54:10] four, but this is just the last day or
[54:13] two. Uh Brother Fabriiono is in the
[54:17] middle with the blue shirt.
[54:21] And then I think the brother with the
[54:23] cowboy hat and another brother right
[54:25] beside brother Fabriiono are are uh they
[54:29] traveled with him and I'm not too sure
[54:32] but I understand that. And then the the
[54:34] brother in the white suit or the light
[54:36] colored suit is a pastor of the church.
[54:39] Next slide please. And uh
[54:44] I guess I could do it myself.
[54:50] That's the uh congregation, part of the
[54:52] congregation.
[54:54] Uh that's another part of the
[54:56] congregation
[54:58] inside. So the the the message is well
[55:01] established in some cities in Angola.
[55:04] This is in Angola. Angola had civil war
[55:08] for 37 years which ended just uh two
[55:13] three years ago.
[55:14] So I tell you these people who've heard
[55:17] the message have have come under from a
[55:20] lot of oppression.
[55:25] So that is that.
[55:37] All right.
[55:39] If you wouldn't mind then to stand. Now
[55:41] we'll read the scripture. Are you ready
[55:43] for the word? Amen.
[55:49] You can turn in the book of Li Leviticus
[55:52] if you would to the 23rd chapter.
[55:57] Thank you musicians
[56:08] and we'll I'm keeping the lights down so
[56:12] I trust you'll be able to read in your
[56:14] Bible, but I also am going to put it on
[56:16] the on the
[56:20] uh on the slide here as well.
[56:40] We're starting at verse 9 and we'll read
[56:44] to verse 11. And if you can just uh
[56:47] change the slides as as I go, please, if
[56:50] you don't mind.
[56:53] And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[56:56] "Speak unto the children of Israel, and
[56:59] say unto them,
[57:01] when you come into the land," would like
[57:03] you to notice that, please, a very
[57:05] important phrase.
[57:08] When you come into the land, Brother
[57:12] Brandham said, "The land is was the
[57:14] promised land, and the promise is the
[57:16] Holy Spirit." So that's your life in the
[57:20] Holy Ghost. When you come into the land
[57:25] which I give unto you, and shall reap
[57:27] the harvest thereof, then you shall
[57:30] bring a sheath of the first fruits of
[57:33] your harvest unto the priest. And he
[57:36] shall wave the sheath before the Lord to
[57:40] be accepted for you on the tomorrow
[57:43] after the Sabbath.
[57:46] The priest shall wave it. And you shall
[57:49] offer that day when you wave the chief
[57:52] and he lamb without blemish
[57:56] of the first year of for a burnt
[57:59] offering unto the Lord. And he shall
[58:01] wave the sheath before the Lord to be
[58:04] accepted for you on the tomorrow after
[58:07] the Sabbath the priest shall wave it. I
[58:11] want to read also in Acts the first
[58:13] chapter and you can turn to that if you
[58:16] would.
[58:23] There's one scripture I'll read while
[58:25] you're turning.
[58:28] The Bible says, "And they truly were
[58:31] many priests
[58:35] because they were not suffered to
[58:39] continue
[58:41] by reason of death.
[58:44] So a priest would come and would die and
[58:47] then another one would raise up and the
[58:49] priest the priest would wave it but the
[58:54] new generation would come and maybe it's
[58:55] a different priest.
[58:57] But then the Bible and I'm getting ahead
[59:00] of myself but but you just so that you
[59:03] won't get lost. Then the Bible speaks of
[59:06] a priest by the name of Melzdc
[59:09] without beginning of days nor end of
[59:12] life. That's a different
[59:15] that's a different order. That's
[59:18] completely a different priest without
[59:19] beginning of days or end of life. You'll
[59:23] have to really stay focused because so
[59:26] that the message won't sound chopped up
[59:28] to you. But in so now we have in the in
[59:32] the in the Old Testament in the type God
[59:35] instituted this because it it it it
[59:40] pointed forward and the Bible is like
[59:43] it's like layered.
[59:45] You have one layer. You have the Old
[59:47] Testament in types and then you have the
[59:50] New Testament. And many of the Old
[59:52] Testament types were fulfilled. And then
[59:55] not all of it was fulfilled because some
[59:57] was left there for you and I.
[1:00:01] And then there's one layer and another
[1:00:03] layer and it and and it it changes. But
[1:00:06] I want to explain the change to you
[1:00:10] because in in life we think well this
[1:00:12] ends and then that starts and this ends
[1:00:14] and that starts and and when he comes
[1:00:17] this will he'll come and then the
[1:00:18] resurrection will take place and that's
[1:00:21] just not quite the way things happen.
[1:00:23] Apostle Paul said in uh Corinthians he
[1:00:27] said and he was speaking about these
[1:00:29] things. He said, "When I was a child, I
[1:00:32] spoke as a child. I understood as a
[1:00:34] child, but when I became a man, he's
[1:00:38] talking about maturity."
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; And this was when you come in the land.
[1:00:44] And when the first sheath that you cut
[1:00:48] down, you don't cut down the grass. You
[1:00:51] don't cut down just an empty stock. You
[1:00:54] cut down a sheath that has come to full
[1:00:57] maturity.
[1:00:58] And so that is another layer of this is
[1:01:03] and before we read the scripture,
[1:01:04] another layer of this was Jesus was the
[1:01:08] first sheath that came to full maturity
[1:01:12] and he was cut down and then he raised
[1:01:15] again and was ra and waved over the
[1:01:18] people. And then the scripture says he
[1:01:21] was waved over the people again at
[1:01:23] Pentecost.
[1:01:24] And the prophet says again in this end
[1:01:27] time he's again waved over the people
[1:01:31] can't be waved if it's not mature wheat.
[1:01:35] Only mature sheath can be waved. So and
[1:01:39] and the priest has to wave it.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; So that brings us you say well Jesus was
[1:01:47] a prophet.
[1:01:49] Well uh when did he become a priest?
[1:01:52] Well, he he matured into that and then
[1:01:55] he became you I'm going back over this
[1:01:58] in a few moments so when you sit down.
[1:02:01] But so when when when did he become a
[1:02:03] priest? Well, uh the prophet in this day
[1:02:06] said when he in the New Testament era,
[1:02:10] he was a priest. He's our high priest
[1:02:14] touched with the feeling of our
[1:02:16] infirmities. Isn't that what the Bible
[1:02:18] says? When did he become that priest?
[1:02:21] Well, Apostle Paul is giving us the key.
[1:02:24] When I was a child, I spake as a child.
[1:02:27] Jesus was coming. He was in He was in
[1:02:30] Abraham. He was in Isaac. He was in
[1:02:32] Jacob. Promised son in Isaac. He was in
[1:02:35] Jacob. He was in in Joseph. He was all
[1:02:38] through. He was in Samuel. He was in
[1:02:40] David. He was in Solomon. When Jesus
[1:02:42] came, a greater than Solomon is here.
[1:02:44] Isn't that what he said?
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; So, so what is it? The maturing all the
[1:02:48] way. Then when he came to the full
[1:02:50] maturity,
[1:02:52] he was cut down. That was that part.
[1:02:55] Went on and brought us redemption.
[1:02:58] Then he raised from the dead. And then
[1:03:00] the Holy Spirit is waved over the
[1:03:02] people. And the Holy Spirit came upon
[1:03:05] the apostles,
[1:03:07] those that believed on him. So I want to
[1:03:11] read these now.
[1:03:13] The disciples in Acts 1 and 10. And
[1:03:17] while they looked steadfastly toward
[1:03:19] heaven, as he went up, behold, two men
[1:03:23] stood by them in white apparel,
[1:03:26] which also said, "Ye men of Galilee, why
[1:03:29] stand ye gazing up into heaven? This
[1:03:32] same Jesus, which is taken up from you
[1:03:35] into heaven, shall so come in like
[1:03:38] manner, as ye have seen him go into
[1:03:41] heaven." And the prophet said he was
[1:03:44] plucked up from the earth and waved over
[1:03:47] the people. Then the Bible tells us in
[1:03:50] Acts, if you will can perhaps turn to
[1:03:53] that one, Acts the 2 chapter verses 1
[1:03:56] and two. And when the day of Pentecost
[1:03:58] was fully come, that was immediately
[1:04:00] after this. And when the day of
[1:04:02] Pentecost was fully come, they were all
[1:04:05] with one accord in one place. And
[1:04:08] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:04:11] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[1:04:14] filled all the house where they were
[1:04:17] sitting and they became filled with the
[1:04:20] Holy Ghost.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; And we we just we everybody's got some
[1:04:24] kind of interpretation. All I can tell
[1:04:26] you is that now Jesus Christ was living
[1:04:30] in them.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[1:04:39] I have this on the slide as well.
[1:04:46] This is just an inter introduction.
[1:04:50] So you have to hang on to these things
[1:04:51] because I'm going to probably repeat
[1:04:53] them later on.
[1:04:55] And this is out of the rising of the sun
[1:04:58] and to be waved again. So now the first
[1:05:01] scripture in Leviticus, it was waved.
[1:05:05] That was a literal sheath waved.
[1:05:09] Then he was plucked up from the earth
[1:05:12] and waved over the people.
[1:05:16] And then on the day of Pentecost,
[1:05:18] prophet said he was waved over the
[1:05:20] people.
[1:05:22] And now here and and he says and to be
[1:05:25] waved again. And we realize in the last
[1:05:27] day according to Luke 17:30
[1:05:32] in the sun s o n day again in the day
[1:05:38] that the s n of man the son of man will
[1:05:42] be revealed or waved over the people.
[1:05:47] If it's revealed to you, when something
[1:05:50] is revealed to a person, it's something
[1:05:54] that's waving over you. It's something
[1:05:56] that's responding. Actually, it's wave
[1:05:58] for your accept to you be accepted. The
[1:06:02] Bible speaks rather the is the rising of
[1:06:05] the sun speaks it's waved as a memorial
[1:06:08] before God. And the Old Testament said
[1:06:11] that it's waved. You shall take it to
[1:06:14] the priest and he shall wave it to the
[1:06:16] people. Didn't take it to Moses.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Took it to the priest because that's
[1:06:22] another office. Jesus Christ is son of
[1:06:26] man as a prophet. He's son of God as a
[1:06:30] priest and he's son of David as a king.
[1:06:33] He's prophet, priest, and king. Well,
[1:06:37] when does he become a prophet? He was a
[1:06:39] long time coming up to being the son of
[1:06:42] man, born of a virgin. He was a long
[1:06:45] time. Then about 30 years, 33 years. And
[1:06:49] that that part that he was living out as
[1:06:52] a redeemer, it was come to fulfillment
[1:06:55] and he's cut down. But he didn't Oh,
[1:07:01] are you following me?
[1:07:03] See, now I'm just speaking out of my
[1:07:05] heart. But he come before Caiaphas.
[1:07:09] Caiaphas was the high priest. But
[1:07:12] Caiaphas had no capacity
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; to wave it.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't the season.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; All Caiaphas could do was commit him to
[1:07:22] the earth,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; committed him to death
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; and planted him. But he said, he said to
[1:07:28] Pilate, "No man takes my life from me.
[1:07:31] I'll lay it down and I'll raise it up
[1:07:33] again." That was different.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; That's how he entered his priesthood by
[1:07:39] raising up his life again.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; So then I have another another quote I'd
[1:07:47] like to read and it's also from the um
[1:07:51] it was the rising of the sun. He said in
[1:07:54] paragraph 96. He said, "Hallelujah.
[1:07:57] I'm sure you see what I'm talking about.
[1:08:00] It was waved over the people and and the
[1:08:05] first time there will come forth for the
[1:08:07] bride age.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; For the bride age, for a resurrection
[1:08:13] out of the dark denominationalism
[1:08:15] will be a message. I just say something
[1:08:18] startling I think to you people. You can
[1:08:21] be dead while you're living.
[1:08:25] You can actually be in a tomb of
[1:08:27] denominationalism
[1:08:29] while you're living.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; There are nothing more all of thousands
[1:08:33] of of denominations and just dead.
[1:08:36] Without Christ, you're dead.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; You have to have grace to receive that
[1:08:48] out of the resurrection. So, we've had a
[1:08:50] resurrection. Amen.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; I can tell you, I was talking to my wife
[1:08:53] just driving here to the church. I said,
[1:08:57] "We've had a resurrection.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; We've actually been resurrected. I could
[1:09:02] no more go back to some old
[1:09:05] denominational
[1:09:07] uh and theories and ideas." And without
[1:09:12] an absolute, thank God we have an
[1:09:15] absolute word. And it may be too strong
[1:09:18] for some, but those that have as the
[1:09:21] prophet said, too rich for some. But
[1:09:23] once you've tasted of it, you can't you
[1:09:26] can't be satisfied with anything less.
[1:09:28] Isn't that wonderful?
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; And he said uh a resurrection out of the
[1:09:37] dark denominationalism will be a
[1:09:39] message.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; That'll be the resurrection.
[1:09:42] That the full maturity of the word that
[1:09:45] the full what? maturity of the word
[1:09:51] has turned back again in its full power
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; and being waved over the people by the
[1:09:58] same signs and wonders that he did back
[1:10:02] there.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; So now I'll just have a beginning.
[1:10:07] So when Jesus the word came to a certain
[1:10:10] place, a certain certain time of
[1:10:14] maturity,
[1:10:16] did Jesus mature? Yes. The word was
[1:10:18] being fulfilled when they Peter was
[1:10:21] going to try to prevent him from going
[1:10:23] to the cross because he spoke about
[1:10:25] death. Said, "You'll never go. I'll go
[1:10:28] with you. You'll never go to death." And
[1:10:30] Jesus said, "How then shall the
[1:10:32] scriptures be fulfilled?"
[1:10:34] How how then shall the scriptures be
[1:10:37] fulfilled being manifested actually
[1:10:39] lived out coming into full maturity? I
[1:10:42] say, how is it possible for a rapture
[1:10:46] not to happen? How is it possible for
[1:10:49] the for the these bodies not to be
[1:10:52] changed? If this word speaks of it, it
[1:10:55] must happen in order for it to come to
[1:10:58] its maturity.
[1:11:03] And so when Jesus had come to that place
[1:11:05] and he entered his priesthood office. So
[1:11:08] you say well when did he enter the
[1:11:10] priesthood office? When I when you were
[1:11:13] a child you spake as a child you
[1:11:14] understood as a child when you became a
[1:11:17] man or when you became a woman. When was
[1:11:19] that?
[1:11:21] Well they call it you know a certain
[1:11:23] time of uh in maybe in the teenage years
[1:11:26] but when was it? What was it? It end
[1:11:28] here and did it start there? Well, no. I
[1:11:31] It's when I became a man or when I
[1:11:33] became a woman. When did that happen?
[1:11:36] When did he become a priest? Well, we
[1:11:38] know that he became a priest because he
[1:11:41] is a high priest touched with the
[1:11:43] feelings of our infirmities.
[1:11:47] In fact, as I want to announce to you,
[1:11:48] don't just sit here and listen to me.
[1:11:51] You can touch, you can actually touch
[1:11:53] him.
[1:11:55] You had a prophet stand before thousands
[1:11:58] and thousands of people year after year
[1:12:00] after year and say these words. Who did
[1:12:03] he touch?
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Who did she touch? Hundreds and hundreds
[1:12:08] and maybe even thousands of people
[1:12:10] around. But somebody touched him.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Who did he touch? Who did she touch? And
[1:12:19] I'll give you a couple of quotes on
[1:12:21] that. And then he said, he said to the
[1:12:23] people that were there in attendance,
[1:12:26] which I can say to you, you can touch
[1:12:28] them.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; You can do something more than go to
[1:12:33] church.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; You can do something more than come
[1:12:36] through the doors.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; You can do something more than sing or
[1:12:40] listen or clap your hands. You can do
[1:12:42] something more. You actually have the
[1:12:44] privilege of touching a high priest.
[1:12:49] If you don't believe that, then our
[1:12:52] religion is vain.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; You can actually touch him.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; That's part of the core of the message
[1:13:03] this morning.
[1:13:05] the message itself, the preaching, I'm I
[1:13:09] would I'd be standing here in vain
[1:13:11] unless we get somebody
[1:13:14] that can touch him
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; and make it work in their lives.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what you need. You
[1:13:21] maybe don't even know, but he knows.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; You came to church this morning maybe
[1:13:26] not even aware of your need, but he
[1:13:28] knows it.
[1:13:34] So Jesus stood before the high priest,
[1:13:37] Caiaphas,
[1:13:39] the high priest. As I said a moment ago,
[1:13:42] he could only commit him.
[1:13:44] There stood the chief.
[1:13:49] There stood the chief
[1:13:52] in front of the high priest, the high
[1:13:55] priest.
[1:13:57] The high priest didn't know who he was.
[1:13:59] The high priest didn't realize he was
[1:14:02] the word in flesh. Jesus knew exactly
[1:14:05] who he was,
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; but he did not know who the the high
[1:14:08] priest didn't know who he was. So he
[1:14:11] committed him to death.
[1:14:15] And fact is the one who was in front of
[1:14:18] him who he was committing to death was
[1:14:20] replacing him.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Think about that one. The condemned was
[1:14:30] replacing the condemmer
[1:14:33] if there is such a word.
[1:14:37] And they laid their laid hold on Jesus.
[1:14:40] Matthew 26:57. Don't turn to it. And
[1:14:44] they laid hold on Jesus and led him away
[1:14:47] to Caiaphas the high priest
[1:14:50] where the scribes and the elders were
[1:14:52] assembled.
[1:14:54] But Taiaphas could not continue because
[1:14:57] of death. And that's the other
[1:14:58] scripture. And they and they truly Paul
[1:15:02] said in to the Hebrews in 7:23 of
[1:15:05] Hebrews and they truly were many priests
[1:15:09] because they could not they were not
[1:15:11] suffered to continue by reason of death.
[1:15:16] The very one that Caiaphas was
[1:15:18] condemning as I said a moment ago was
[1:15:21] replacing him.
[1:15:23] not only replacing him but replacing a
[1:15:26] whole new order. The Levitical
[1:15:28] priesthood, the whole priesthood was
[1:15:31] passing off the same.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; I'll probably leave you with a lot of
[1:15:37] questions, but just hang on because
[1:15:39] we'll answer some of them as we go
[1:15:42] along. We need to we need to cover these
[1:15:44] things. So, now a whole new priesthood,
[1:15:48] a whole new order was being established.
[1:15:54] There are two in the Old Testament
[1:15:57] that have connection with Melzdc.
[1:16:02] One, listen close. One was Abraham
[1:16:08] who MelzDC came and met him in a body
[1:16:13] and one was David. He's mentioned twice.
[1:16:17] once in the Old Testament in Genesis and
[1:16:19] once in the Old Testament in Psalms.
[1:16:23] And the spirit
[1:16:26] in these men,
[1:16:28] not their literal sperm,
[1:16:32] but something that was greater than
[1:16:34] their sperm,
[1:16:37] greater than the sperm that produced
[1:16:40] Isaac. Isaac was only reflective.
[1:16:44] Isaac only indicated another promised
[1:16:47] son was coming
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; that was of another seed.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; That God the creator
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; who put sperm in a man's body had a had
[1:16:57] another word had another sperm the
[1:17:00] spoken word of God
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; and and that and that God is going to
[1:17:06] attribute his son out of his bosom to
[1:17:10] Abraham and also to David. And so
[1:17:14] Genesis, those two they spoke of, they
[1:17:17] spoke and the Bible says in Genesis, in
[1:17:19] Genesis, I'm going to be slow now so I
[1:17:22] don't don't rush ahead. And Melzdc,
[1:17:26] notice please, and Melzdc,
[1:17:30] king of Salem,
[1:17:33] priest of the most high God.
[1:17:38] And he was priest of the most high God.
[1:17:42] and and Apostle Paul speaks of him and
[1:17:45] says, "And he met Abraham
[1:17:49] and God said of Abraham, he's my
[1:17:52] prophet."
[1:17:54] So now you have once in the Old
[1:17:58] Testament, you have all three offices
[1:18:02] merging
[1:18:04] being reflected on earth at one time.
[1:18:08] Prophet, priest, and king. He was king
[1:18:12] of Salem, priest of the most high God,
[1:18:15] meeting Abraham the prophet. That was
[1:18:18] once.
[1:18:23] You're quiet. I'll suggest to you,
[1:18:27] perhaps you don't realize the
[1:18:29] significance
[1:18:30] of this modern age that you're living
[1:18:32] in. Don't let the modern age rob you of
[1:18:36] the reality of the spiritual age.
[1:18:39] A prophet came in this modern age and
[1:18:42] said this is the bride age.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; This is not the glory of the 21st
[1:18:47] century or the 20th century. It's a
[1:18:49] bride age. There's a group of people
[1:18:52] that actually have a living mature
[1:18:56] manifested word being waved over them.
[1:19:00] And there are some of those that are
[1:19:02] promised
[1:19:04] of God. And he said, "I'm going to wave
[1:19:06] my word over them." They will catch it
[1:19:09] and realize that there's something
[1:19:12] taking place. And these men, something
[1:19:15] was in them. Something was in Abraham.
[1:19:19] Something was in
[1:19:21] and Melzdc. He met him after the
[1:19:23] slaughter of the kings. And he gave him
[1:19:25] a tenth. He gave him a tenth of all that
[1:19:29] he had
[1:19:35] of all of the peoples of the earth. Out
[1:19:39] of Abraham
[1:19:41] came a promised seed
[1:19:43] and out of all of the peoples, you
[1:19:46] happen to be a crop.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; You are a crop.
[1:19:54] You're a crop of young people. You're a
[1:19:56] crop of older people. You're a crop of
[1:19:58] people. And God is harvesting his crop.
[1:20:04] And Abraham gave him a tenth because it
[1:20:08] may well be that God is taking his
[1:20:10] tenth.
[1:20:12] Think about it. He's harvesting,
[1:20:16] his crop of humanity.
[1:20:20] And there's a certain amount of them
[1:20:22] that are my children. And Jesus referred
[1:20:25] to it, my sheep.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; They hear my voice.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; And it says in Psalms, "The Lord hath
[1:20:40] sworn,
[1:20:41] he will not repent.
[1:20:44] Thou art a priest forever after the
[1:20:46] order of Melzdc." Not David. But he was
[1:20:50] prophesying of something yet to come.
[1:20:52] The Lord hath sworn and he will not
[1:20:55] repent. Thou art a priest forever after
[1:20:58] the order of Melzdc.
[1:21:00] It's really amazing
[1:21:03] in your Bible
[1:21:09] as it is in my Bible.
[1:21:14] There's the page between Malachi
[1:21:18] and Matthew. It's really amazing
[1:21:23] that the first verse
[1:21:25] of the of the New Testament is the book
[1:21:29] of the generation of Jesus Christ,
[1:21:32] the son of David. He mentioned Melazdc.
[1:21:36] And the son of Abraham, he mentioned
[1:21:38] Melzdc.
[1:21:41] Isn't that really amazing?
[1:21:44] Isn't that really amazing?
[1:21:47] the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[1:21:51] Here's a whole new priesthood. Now, it's
[1:21:54] showing him this is his record. And now
[1:21:57] he's coming into
[1:21:59] into his uh to fulfill that part of the
[1:22:03] word of God that speaks of him. And he
[1:22:06] fulfilled it. He fulfilled that part.
[1:22:09] But there was a part he said, "I must go
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; and I will not leave you comfortless,
[1:22:15] but I will come to you."
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; And he was plucked up from the earth
[1:22:21] and waved over the people because he was
[1:22:24] w he wasn't waved over the 5,000 that
[1:22:27] left him. He was waved over a handful
[1:22:30] that kept and believed on him.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; He was actually waved over a group of
[1:22:35] people that didn't know what was
[1:22:36] happening. He was waved over people that
[1:22:39] were were had tunnel vision. They said,
[1:22:43] "Oh, after 30, 40 days of being seen by
[1:22:47] him of by many uh supernatural things,
[1:22:52] he was waved over the people." And so
[1:22:54] they were wondering, "Are you at this
[1:22:56] time going to restore the kingdom to
[1:22:58] Israel? Is that what's going to happen?
[1:23:01] Are we going to come back to our old
[1:23:02] glory and our old power? And is that
[1:23:05] what's going to happen? And Jesus said,
[1:23:07] "No, it's not for you to know the times
[1:23:10] or the seasons the Father has put in his
[1:23:12] own power, but you shall receive power."
[1:23:16] In other words, you'll make it to the
[1:23:18] end. You shall receive power after that
[1:23:21] the Holy Ghost has come upon you.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he was and and and while
[1:23:27] they were standing there and he was
[1:23:28] blessing them, he was lifted up in a
[1:23:30] cloud into heaven and vanished from
[1:23:33] them. And they were there gazing and the
[1:23:35] and the and the angel said, "What are
[1:23:38] you gazing into heaven for? This same
[1:23:41] Jesus that was taken from you will come
[1:23:43] in like manner." Well, they didn't know
[1:23:46] even what was happening.
[1:23:48] They couldn't understand things. They
[1:23:50] didn't have things all slotted out.
[1:23:52] Neither do you or I. The prophet said,
[1:23:55] "If you have things figured out, you can
[1:23:56] be sure of one thing, you're wrong."
[1:24:02] How many people have ever been wrong?
[1:24:09] So now we have we have him coming into a
[1:24:13] a new priesthood, a new priesthood. And
[1:24:17] Paul said in Hebrews 7:1, "For this
[1:24:20] Melzdc, king of Salem and priest of the
[1:24:23] most high God, who met Abraham returning
[1:24:27] from the slaughter of the kings,
[1:24:30] because God said to Aimilec
[1:24:33] when he when he had uh uh Abraham had
[1:24:38] kind of gone wayward and he said to his
[1:24:41] wife, "Tell them that you're my sister
[1:24:44] because you're very beautiful and they
[1:24:46] will take you etc and kill me. And God
[1:24:49] spoke to Aimilec and said, "Now
[1:24:51] therefore restore the man his wife, for
[1:24:53] he is a prophet, and he shall pray for
[1:24:56] thee, and thou shalt live." And he told
[1:24:59] him, "If you don't, you're going to
[1:25:00] die."
[1:25:02] That's that's how much God thought of
[1:25:04] Abraham. Did Abraham Abraham think that
[1:25:07] much of himself? Well, I don't think he
[1:25:09] did. I don't think he realized. But now
[1:25:12] these three offices of prophet, priest,
[1:25:15] and king merging together at one time on
[1:25:18] the earth. I hope you will catch and
[1:25:20] stay with me. This is the first man of
[1:25:23] promise.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Abraham is the first man of promise.
[1:25:28] He's like living. It's like having a a
[1:25:30] miniature picture of everything that's
[1:25:33] happening. And so he meets Melzdc
[1:25:36] because you're meeting him.
[1:25:40] He become a priest. He become a high
[1:25:43] priest. Well, I thought that this was a
[1:25:45] son of man ministry which was prophet.
[1:25:48] But it's it's it's really amazing. I'm
[1:25:50] not trying to introduce some new
[1:25:52] doctrine to you, but it's really amazing
[1:25:55] when you just think of things as they
[1:25:57] are maturing. Those of you that are
[1:26:00] well-versed in the message at least, if
[1:26:04] you go to 1965,
[1:26:06] and you realize and you just say, you
[1:26:09] know, this is the last year
[1:26:13] uh uh uh of a prophet of God, the spirit
[1:26:16] of Elijah.
[1:26:20] And I'll never forget I'll never forget
[1:26:22] what Tommy Osburn says. He said, "You
[1:26:25] won't you won't see this again.
[1:26:29] you won't see this again.
[1:26:32] You're not going to have another
[1:26:33] messenger.
[1:26:35] And I was going to the end of of one of
[1:26:39] the services
[1:26:41] uh 1965 services.
[1:26:44] All these people that have all of their
[1:26:47] questions, I'd like them to just to go
[1:26:50] to the end of one service and be if they
[1:26:53] can't tell me what that is that's
[1:26:55] happening there, then they need to keep
[1:26:57] their mouth shut.
[1:27:00] All they can do is ask questions.
[1:27:01] Parkbench politicians have find they
[1:27:05] know how to run the government and
[1:27:06] everything else, but they can't even
[1:27:08] make enough to to buy food for
[1:27:10] themselves. And these people here, they
[1:27:13] can't find an ounce of a a truth that
[1:27:17] that I that I would even desire. But
[1:27:20] when I hear him say, "And you uh you
[1:27:23] have a sinus, you have a sinus problem,
[1:27:25] but the one right next to you, that's
[1:27:27] your wife, and next to her is her
[1:27:29] sister. And who is that that's saying
[1:27:32] all that? Who is that that knows all of
[1:27:35] those things?" You might say, "Well,
[1:27:37] that was kind of insignificant." And not
[1:27:39] insignificant to them.
[1:27:44] You might say, "Well, this is a this is
[1:27:47] a rather insignificant thing. I I'm I'm,
[1:27:50] you know, I I feel okay. I'm okay. Maybe
[1:27:52] you're not okay."
[1:27:55] Spiritually,
[1:27:57] maybe you are, but maybe you aren't. Do
[1:28:01] we have a need spiritually? I think so.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; I think so. And this high priest that
[1:28:07] I'm speaking of say, "Well, when did he
[1:28:10] become high priest?" I don't really care
[1:28:12] when he become high priest. But the
[1:28:14] Bible says you'll be
[1:28:18] and God will not repent about this.
[1:28:21] Thou shalt be a priest after the order
[1:28:23] of Melzdc. There'll be a priest. So here
[1:28:27] come here come a prophet of God uh to
[1:28:31] reveal the son of man. Luke 17:30. But
[1:28:34] in the last in the last 12 months, the
[1:28:37] last Easter
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; that the world is having, the last one,
[1:28:41] he says it'll be the rising of the sun.
[1:28:43] And again in this day,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; what does that mean?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Does that mean what it says? I guess it
[1:28:50] does. And again in this day, it has to
[1:28:53] be waved again.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Why did it have to become again? Because
[1:28:56] the word that he was fulfilling was
[1:28:59] coming to its end,
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; coming to its maturity. there would not
[1:29:04] be another Easter. He could not speak
[1:29:06] the same thing again. He would be gone
[1:29:09] by the time another Easter came. This
[1:29:11] was as mature as that word was going to
[1:29:14] become as far as Easter is concerned.
[1:29:17] And the world is remembering a
[1:29:19] resurrection. But he's taking it further
[1:29:21] saying the word was waved over the
[1:29:24] people. And again in the last day
[1:29:27] according to Luke 17:30 when the son of
[1:29:30] man will be revealed. It has to be waved
[1:29:33] over the people again.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And he's entering his priesthood or he
[1:29:40] entered his priesthood under I won't say
[1:29:44] under Caiaphas but in that era when
[1:29:47] things were happening he entered into
[1:29:49] his priesthood. He he he was not the son
[1:29:53] of man anymore. He raised to become
[1:29:56] entering into his priesthood. And now in
[1:29:59] this day, you can do what you want with
[1:30:02] this, but he was ending his priesthood.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Well, does he ever stop being a prophet?
[1:30:09] No.
[1:30:13] Because he is he's God.
[1:30:16] Does he ever stop being a priest? No.
[1:30:21] But he shifts and changes the
[1:30:23] administration of it and how you how you
[1:30:27] how it's administered and how you get
[1:30:29] the benefits.
[1:30:34] Just sit there nice and quiet. Now
[1:30:37] when Apostle Paul came
[1:30:40] and he said when he ascended he's the
[1:30:43] same he he that ascended is the same
[1:30:45] that descended. And when he ascended, he
[1:30:47] gave gifts unto man.
[1:30:50] This the same God that gave uh the
[1:30:53] Levites said, "You'll have a Levite
[1:30:55] priesthood order." And the Levites and
[1:30:59] everyone that is everyone that opens the
[1:31:01] womb is a son unto me. But the Levites,
[1:31:04] they won't have any inheritance in the
[1:31:07] promised land. I'm their inheritance.
[1:31:10] And that was such a such a divine order.
[1:31:13] And they kept the Levites and the
[1:31:15] Levites and the Levites. And finally,
[1:31:17] Apostle Paul comes with a whole new
[1:31:19] dispensation, a whole whole new economy.
[1:31:23] And he brushes them all aside and says,
[1:31:25] "There's apostles, prophets, pastors,
[1:31:28] teachers, and evangelists. That's it."
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And there's helps and there's
[1:31:34] governments, and there's various things.
[1:31:37] But he never once spoke about the
[1:31:38] Levites. In fact is it it is said that
[1:31:41] the the the priesthood could not
[1:31:43] continue because of death. But now here
[1:31:46] comes a new order under Melzdc without
[1:31:50] beginning of days nor end of life. This
[1:31:53] is a new one. You're not called to a
[1:31:55] Levitical under Levitical priesthood.
[1:31:58] You're called to one that has no
[1:32:00] beginning of life or end of life or
[1:32:02] beginning of life or end of life or end
[1:32:04] of days. What is what is the prophet of
[1:32:07] God? If there's anything he established,
[1:32:10] I said, "God, help me get this across to
[1:32:12] you." He said, "If you have eternal
[1:32:14] life, if you are ever there, you're
[1:32:17] always there. You eternal life has no
[1:32:20] beginning and no end. That's the
[1:32:23] priesthood you are called under. If you
[1:32:26] want to, you know, you live so many
[1:32:28] days, etc., etc., that's a that's an
[1:32:31] earthly order. We're not under an
[1:32:33] earthly order. Yes, you are born by your
[1:32:36] parents etc etc. But let me tell you
[1:32:39] even the prophet of God said that the
[1:32:41] day came when he found out he was not
[1:32:44] just a son not just a son of Ella and
[1:32:47] and and Mr. Brham but he was a he was a
[1:32:51] son of God.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; And and our heritage really doesn't mean
[1:32:57] that much.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; I went with brother Milo to Yugoslavia.
[1:33:02] I went to Norway. I went to Sweden. I
[1:33:05] went to Finland. I went to Poland which
[1:33:08] was just about 90 kilometers from the
[1:33:10] Ukraine. I went to India. I went to
[1:33:13] India again. I went to China. Went to
[1:33:15] these places. And I often wondered why
[1:33:18] God wouldn't allow me to go even to my
[1:33:20] own where my where my forefathers came
[1:33:23] from. And it was years of going to all
[1:33:26] of these other places. Never went
[1:33:28] because God's not interested really
[1:33:30] where my forefathers came from.
[1:33:34] God is trying to say to us, "I'm your
[1:33:36] father."
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; We're not connected emotionally. I want
[1:33:42] to go back there cuz my roots are back
[1:33:45] there. Your roots aren't back there.
[1:33:48] Your roots are in heaven.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; We are of another nation. We're a holy
[1:33:54] nation.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; I might be touching some soft spots, but
[1:33:59] just
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; don't scoot away.
[1:34:03] Just say out.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; That'll be fine.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; We're not Americans. We're not
[1:34:11] Canadians. This is where we live. The
[1:34:14] prophet said, "This is where we live. We
[1:34:16] We may love this place, but that's not
[1:34:19] what we are. What we really are."
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And the prophet came to establish us
[1:34:26] into eternal life.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Eternal life. If you were ever there,
[1:34:33] if you're going to be there, he said you
[1:34:35] had to be there before.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; That's not pre-existence. That's not
[1:34:41] pre-existence. We don't believe on that.
[1:34:43] But you were in the mind of God. You
[1:34:45] were in the thoughts of God. Jesus,
[1:34:47] although born of the Virgin Mary, he
[1:34:49] never made a big issue out of that. He
[1:34:52] always said, "I come from God.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Father, father." He never talked about
[1:34:58] Joseph being father. Father, father, yes
[1:35:01] m maybe some human parents and not
[1:35:05] belittling them. I think that they
[1:35:07] deserve a great deal of credit and a
[1:35:09] great deal of love, great deal of
[1:35:12] respect and loyalty. I believe in that.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; But more so, we need to respect a
[1:35:20] heavenly father.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; We need to be in tune. Father, did you
[1:35:25] say something?
[1:35:28] You need to be in tune. this morning.
[1:35:29] Father, are you trying to say something
[1:35:32] to me?
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; When you were a child, you maybe didn't
[1:35:36] understand your father and mother. When
[1:35:39] you were a child, but when you became a
[1:35:42] man and a woman, and you begin to
[1:35:44] understand what they were saying to you,
[1:35:48] it's time for us. We're not playing
[1:35:51] church. We're not just at a Sunday
[1:35:53] school picnic. We're here
[1:35:57] having a mature word. Too mature for a
[1:36:01] lot of people. But I say give it to me.
[1:36:04] And I prayed this morning. Oh God, I
[1:36:06] prayed at home. I prayed in a study
[1:36:09] here. Get put the people in a channel of
[1:36:12] revelation and let give me a mind of
[1:36:16] revelation.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:23] And so now that I've
[1:36:26] in the message of revelation of Jesus
[1:36:28] Christ, it says he said, "I am he that
[1:36:31] was
[1:36:33] he that is
[1:36:35] and shall come, the Almighty." He had a
[1:36:39] three-fold being on the earth.
[1:36:43] When he was on earth, he was a
[1:36:46] three-fold being. On earth, he was a
[1:36:48] prophet.
[1:36:51] He's also in heaven a priest.
[1:36:55] And when he comes back to the earth
[1:36:57] again, he'll be a king. It's not, oh, he
[1:37:01] stops being a priest, now he's going to
[1:37:03] be a king.
[1:37:05] It's a maturing of the word, a
[1:37:07] fulfilling. Oh, I think it's going to
[1:37:10] happen. I think it's going to happen.
[1:37:12] You don't even know.
[1:37:15] Maybe you don't know even what came
[1:37:17] across my desk.
[1:37:20] was some pictures and we've all we're
[1:37:23] all aware of the terrible catastrophic
[1:37:26] event in Nepal
[1:37:31] and thousands lost their life innocent
[1:37:33] people.
[1:37:37] I understand that a Christian brother
[1:37:42] who was preaching in Nepal four months
[1:37:46] ago was burned to death alive
[1:37:50] was burned to death because he was
[1:37:52] preaching the gospel.
[1:37:55] And they said that when this earthquake
[1:37:57] ripped through Nepal, it went just like
[1:38:00] it was on a target and wo through and
[1:38:03] struck some of the most revered and re
[1:38:06] and honored
[1:38:08] places of temples and their idolatry.
[1:38:13] I was in Nepal.
[1:38:16] I went to one of their places
[1:38:19] and the people were walking around. They
[1:38:21] have
[1:38:23] cylindrical
[1:38:25] uh things about that long and they're
[1:38:30] embossed with the letters of their
[1:38:33] alphabet and their words and they're I
[1:38:36] said, "What are these?" They're they're
[1:38:38] prayers.
[1:38:39] They're prayers. You know how the people
[1:38:42] were praying? They're walking by and
[1:38:45] spinning that one and spinning this one.
[1:38:47] They didn't even have to say or think a
[1:38:49] prayer. That was slick.
[1:38:54] Just And they had said a prayer. Said
[1:38:56] that prayer. Said that prayer. Said that
[1:38:58] prayer.
[1:39:00] Said another prayer.
[1:39:03] Then I come to a place. There was a hole
[1:39:04] in the wall. There's red red substance.
[1:39:09] I can see it was blood all over the
[1:39:11] door.
[1:39:13] And I said, "Well, what is this? What
[1:39:16] blood is this?" They said, "That's goat
[1:39:17] blood."
[1:39:19] said, "That makes sense. In a place like
[1:39:22] this, they wouldn't kill a sheep. They
[1:39:24] wouldn't kill a lamb, but they kill a
[1:39:26] goat,
[1:39:28] kill a scoundrel,
[1:39:32] and they put a goat, the goat has to go
[1:39:34] through there, and I think it's once a
[1:39:36] year or something, and they put the
[1:39:38] blood over the door."
[1:39:40] Isn't that close?
[1:39:45] something that was preached here not
[1:39:47] long ago.
[1:39:52] Brother Tim Pro, not Tim Pro, but
[1:39:54] Brother Ron Spencer
[1:39:57] was saying,
[1:40:00] he was saying, for those of you that
[1:40:02] weren't here that Wednesday night,
[1:40:05] he was saying that was it Michelangelo
[1:40:10] and he painted Christ and he looked for
[1:40:14] thousands of faces. Pardon? looked for
[1:40:18] thousands of faces so he could paint
[1:40:21] Christ. And it took him years and then
[1:40:25] years and years later he was looking for
[1:40:29] someone that would fit Judas.
[1:40:32] And it took him years and years and he's
[1:40:34] looking and he studied the anatomy of
[1:40:36] people and everything so he could paint
[1:40:38] it right.
[1:40:40] And he found one and he had them sitting
[1:40:42] before him.
[1:40:45] And this this this man said that he
[1:40:48] don't you don't you recognize me? Don't
[1:40:50] you know me? No. He said, "I've never
[1:40:52] seen you in my life." Yeah. I said, "You
[1:40:55] you had me here as a as a model for
[1:40:59] Jesus."
[1:41:01] And now he was painting Judas.
[1:41:05] And that's how close. And brother,
[1:41:09] brother Ron Spencer was making a very
[1:41:11] powerful point. Things that look so
[1:41:14] right
[1:41:16] and things that look so worshipful
[1:41:20] actually may be a Judas.
[1:41:23] Not that we're suspect of anyone, not
[1:41:26] not at all. But that's is that's how
[1:41:29] careful a person has to be. And now here
[1:41:32] comes a prophet on the scene in this
[1:41:34] time and he says and he sees all this
[1:41:37] lovely people and lovely people but the
[1:41:42] system is taking them. He said to a
[1:41:45] slaughter.
[1:41:47] Is that what he said? Do you love the
[1:41:49] message? That's what the message says.
[1:41:52] Take him to a slaughter. It's the
[1:41:54] innocent people. And here are many many
[1:41:56] of these innocent people in Nepal. I
[1:42:00] don't know.
[1:42:02] I don't know if they recognize what's
[1:42:04] happening or what happened, but it it
[1:42:07] struck me as being very very scary
[1:42:12] because I I had my little computer open
[1:42:15] and I would see what was taking place in
[1:42:17] your heart aches for those people.
[1:42:19] Should we stop sending aid? No, not at
[1:42:21] all. Do all that you can. Do all that
[1:42:24] the government can. I just wish they
[1:42:26] could get it in there sooner. But yet on
[1:42:28] the other hand, you're never going to
[1:42:30] change the hand of God.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me?
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; God does as he as he pleases.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; And when God decides that one order is
[1:42:41] done, it's done.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; And do you want to know? You want to
[1:42:50] know why? Why the churches are where
[1:42:52] they are today? They re rejected the
[1:42:55] word of God in a prophet's mouth.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; And there's no way back.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Some here, some there, one here, one
[1:43:08] there may come to repentance,
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; but there's no way. You won't recover
[1:43:14] the nations of the world.
[1:43:17] You will not recover them. And you have
[1:43:20] and the Bible speaks of those
[1:43:24] nations whose Lord who whose God is not
[1:43:28] the Lord.
[1:43:31] So he had a three-fold purpose. Can I
[1:43:35] continue?
[1:43:38] For a short time, not too long.
[1:43:43] He said he was he was Jesus a prophet.
[1:43:47] He that was now is a priest making
[1:43:52] spiritual sacrifice a high priest and
[1:43:55] can be touched by the feelings of our
[1:43:57] infirmities
[1:43:59] and disclose himself and prove that he's
[1:44:02] in the midst of us prophet priest and
[1:44:06] king but one God. Now the Bible speaks
[1:44:10] of the quickening power. And Jesus
[1:44:11] answered and said unto them destroy this
[1:44:14] temple and I will raise it up. said in
[1:44:17] John 10:18, "No man taketh it from me,
[1:44:20] but I lay it down of myself. I have
[1:44:23] power to lay it down, and I have power
[1:44:25] to take it again. This commandment have
[1:44:28] I received of my father."
[1:44:32] And then in uh he raised himself and
[1:44:35] entered into his priesthood. It is on
[1:44:38] the It is the rising of the sun, not on
[1:44:41] the Sabbath, on the seventh day, but on
[1:44:44] the first day, which we call Sunday, su
[1:44:48] n d a y. He said, and it's it's not su n
[1:44:54] anymore. It's the s o n the sun day that
[1:45:00] the corn of wheat God's first one up
[1:45:03] from the dead was it is to be waved over
[1:45:06] the congregation.
[1:45:08] They were they
[1:45:11] that we are his seed. What is it waved
[1:45:14] over for? That we are his seed.
[1:45:19] And that's the first one of those that
[1:45:22] slept. You know, let let me
[1:45:28] I have some background. I've been in
[1:45:30] these meetings perhaps the meetings that
[1:45:33] you weren't. I rejoice with other people
[1:45:36] to see the manifestation
[1:45:38] of of of the ministry,
[1:45:42] not just a ministry, but the
[1:45:43] manifestation. And then if if that's all
[1:45:47] there was to it, I can tell you if if
[1:45:51] the this mouthpiece had not answered not
[1:45:55] just answered technical questions,
[1:45:58] everybody's got those, but to answer
[1:46:02] deep spiritual questions and then people
[1:46:05] come I can I can tell you as a
[1:46:07] congregation of people that the people
[1:46:10] come to a peace. They come to a rest
[1:46:14] that is cannot be described. Why do we
[1:46:17] come to a peace? Why do we come to rest?
[1:46:20] I don't know exactly why, but I know
[1:46:22] that there's a deep yearning within a
[1:46:24] believer's heart and there are certain
[1:46:26] questions and God answers those
[1:46:28] questions. We we don't even perhaps you
[1:46:31] can't even define the question and you
[1:46:34] can't define the answer but God just so
[1:46:37] answers a person's life gives answer to
[1:46:41] what's happening in the world. We don't
[1:46:43] have the questions perhaps the shepherd
[1:46:45] had in Switzerland. We don't have the
[1:46:48] answers for that other people seek in
[1:46:51] some countries. But we know one thing
[1:46:54] that this is Satan's Eden
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; and it shall become God's kingdom
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; and this earth will be renovated
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; and the king of kings shall rule again.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; When how I don't know and really I don't
[1:47:14] care the sooner the better. But he said
[1:47:18] it and he will do it. And that is where
[1:47:20] comfort comes. That's where peace is
[1:47:24] because God said it and he will do it.
[1:47:27] Hallelujah. Come with me. Nothing's out
[1:47:31] of control.
[1:47:33] God has everything in his hands. Say,
[1:47:35] "Oh, this is happening. That's
[1:47:37] happening." We just forget it. God's in
[1:47:40] control.
[1:47:42] And when the when the maturity I know
[1:47:44] one thing that in this end time a mature
[1:47:49] word came back
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; and I know that the messenger was
[1:47:54] revealing the son of man. I didn't fall
[1:47:58] in love with William Brham. I fell in
[1:48:00] love with Jesus Christ.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Did you really fall in love with him?
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. We fell in love with Jesus Christ.
[1:48:11] I don't weep because I see a man. But
[1:48:13] tears come to my eyes when I feel a
[1:48:16] presence of the almighty God. When 50
[1:48:20] years later, what's 50 years? Nothing.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; What's a 100 years? Nothing. Nothing to
[1:48:26] God. Just a breath.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus was on the cross according to the
[1:48:30] scripture. The day it says a thousand
[1:48:32] years. Two days ago, Jesus was just off
[1:48:35] the cross.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Just 2,000 years. two days ago he's
[1:48:40] entering into his priesthood and now
[1:48:42] he's now he's departing that priesthood
[1:48:45] when somebody may rise and say it's
[1:48:48] over. I don't say that. I don't know. I
[1:48:51] know that it's maturing that way. And I
[1:48:53] can tell you that it's less and less and
[1:48:55] less
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; and I can tell you that the last soul
[1:48:58] that comes in will be the most expensive
[1:49:01] one.
[1:49:03] All the efforts of all the bride across
[1:49:05] the whole land across the whole world,
[1:49:08] every effort, every preacher, everyone
[1:49:11] in the bride of Jesus Christ will be out
[1:49:13] there after that one last one. Who is
[1:49:16] that last one? I don't know. But this
[1:49:19] church and this people and this body of
[1:49:22] mine will keep will keep driving be a
[1:49:25] driving force as much as I can until
[1:49:28] that last one comes in.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:32] And we have a vindicated word. When that
[1:49:35] last one comes in, there'll be no more.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; When that last one comes in, we go home.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; How? I don't know.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Will there be those gazing?
[1:49:50] This prophet says there'll be people
[1:49:51] coming to the altar after it's over.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; There'll be people preaching after it's
[1:49:56] over.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Has somebody said,
[1:50:01] thinking they're getting saved.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, my goodness, that's
[1:50:07] that sounds
[1:50:09] really sad." Well, what's really amazing
[1:50:11] is people today are kneeling thinking
[1:50:13] they're getting saved. And all I've been
[1:50:15] fed is a bunch of emotions. And if
[1:50:18] they'd listened to a prophet, they'd
[1:50:19] say, "These emotions are only here to
[1:50:21] help you contact this world. I feel that
[1:50:24] it's a little bit cool. You don't feel
[1:50:26] it cool. I do because I've got my hand
[1:50:28] on it.
[1:50:31] Fact is right now my body says I'm a
[1:50:33] little thirsty
[1:50:38] that water didn't go to my soul
[1:50:42] just went to this body.
[1:50:46] Are you getting some understanding?
[1:50:49] So that's that's all this body is.
[1:50:51] People get there said well I wept. Well
[1:50:52] the body wept.
[1:50:54] Well I heard a story while your emotions
[1:50:56] were touched.
[1:50:58] I I I was told a sad story
[1:51:02] and and I and I cried. Lots of people
[1:51:05] cry. People hear sad stories all the
[1:51:08] time. And then you hear a preacher come
[1:51:10] up and he comes to the end of his
[1:51:12] message. He he tells a a tearjerkering
[1:51:14] story.
[1:51:16] He wants to move the people to the altar
[1:51:20] before they hit that door and may be
[1:51:22] gone.
[1:51:24] Well, I I I I left. I I was told how bad
[1:51:27] I was, and so I cried over it. All kinds
[1:51:30] of people cry. I've had them cry in my
[1:51:32] office.
[1:51:36] Okay.
[1:51:38] I see like brother G wrote all anyway.
[1:51:44] Are you too tired for me to carry on?
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be labeled as
[1:51:48] long-winded even though I've got that
[1:51:50] kind of that record.
[1:51:54] And he said, he said, and I continue,
[1:51:57] and that's why they had to wave the
[1:51:58] sheath, for it was the first one that
[1:52:01] come to maturity, and it was waved for a
[1:52:04] memorial of thanksgiving to God. And
[1:52:07] this is the phrase I love, believing
[1:52:10] that the rest of them would come.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Do you get it?
[1:52:20] believing that the rest of them would
[1:52:22] come. He said it was a sign.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; So here he is the first one to come to
[1:52:28] maturity.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; He fulfilled everything. He could say it
[1:52:32] is finished.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then he was waved over
[1:52:36] the people. Father, this is a memorial.
[1:52:39] It's finished. I've done all that you
[1:52:42] told me to do. Now I'm waving it as a
[1:52:45] memorial over the people because they're
[1:52:48] the ones that believed on me. They're
[1:52:50] the ones that believed. They didn't
[1:52:51] necessarily have it. They weren't doing
[1:52:53] all the miracles he was doing, but they
[1:52:56] he was waved over them as a memorial to
[1:52:59] God.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; That there's more like me in the field.
[1:53:04] Some of them aren't even born yet. Some
[1:53:06] of them are going to come up in 2010
[1:53:10] and 2011. And some of them are going to
[1:53:12] be sitting here in 2015
[1:53:16] and as a memorial.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Well, was that just
[1:53:22] Christ?" No.
[1:53:25] Christ was the virgin born.
[1:53:27] Now he had to have a son that was an
[1:53:29] adopted son.
[1:53:32] And here come a man
[1:53:34] say, "Well, who was William Brandham?"
[1:53:36] He said, "I was a sinner saved by grace,
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; just like you.
[1:53:42] But he recognized and believed in his
[1:53:46] calling what he was called to do.
[1:53:51] Just hold your seats. Now I'm going to
[1:53:53] close in a few moments.
[1:54:00] You can go to your libraries. I
[1:54:02] challenge you to go to your libraries.
[1:54:06] Go in your Google or go to Wikipedia or
[1:54:09] go to wherever you want to go. You will
[1:54:12] not find a ministry that duplicated
[1:54:14] William Brandon's ministry.
[1:54:19] You will not find it. Why? Because it
[1:54:22] was a redeemed son of God that had come
[1:54:26] to full maturity.
[1:54:29] There are certain words, certain of the
[1:54:31] Luke 17:30 had to be fulfilled.
[1:54:36] Malachi 4 had to be fulfilled. The
[1:54:40] messenger to the Leody Leodysian church
[1:54:43] age had to be fulfilled.
[1:54:47] So I want to just say this congregation,
[1:54:49] you can kick me out if you want, but
[1:54:52] this ministry
[1:54:55] is waved over the people saying that is
[1:54:59] done.
[1:55:01] And God is not going to duplicate it
[1:55:03] again.
[1:55:05] You will not find it again. And it was
[1:55:09] waved over you when you didn't even know
[1:55:12] it. Say, "Well, I I didn't live back
[1:55:14] then." You didn't have to live back
[1:55:16] then. It was a memorial to God that
[1:55:19] there's more like this in the field. And
[1:55:22] they're going to come up and they're
[1:55:24] going to believe and the manifestation
[1:55:26] of the word is going to be waved over
[1:55:28] them and they're going to believe this
[1:55:30] word because they actually possess the
[1:55:33] promise. They came from God. They're
[1:55:35] part of this word. And when they see
[1:55:37] this word, they're going to believe it.
[1:55:40] And they won't even know why they
[1:55:42] believe it anymore than the disciples or
[1:55:44] the apostles knew. We can read that they
[1:55:46] didn't know why they believed it. We may
[1:55:48] not know why we believe it, but we know
[1:55:50] one thing. The truth speaks to the
[1:55:53] truth. There's something within an
[1:55:56] individual. It's not something you're
[1:55:59] convinced about. It is something that is
[1:56:01] reality.
[1:56:03] It's something you crave.
[1:56:06] I craved water a few moments ago. I
[1:56:08] don't know why I need water. Say, well,
[1:56:11] some scientist can tell you. I don't
[1:56:12] know nothing about the science of it. I
[1:56:15] know one thing. When I have it, my
[1:56:17] thirst is quenched. And I know another
[1:56:19] thing. When I had an answer, my thirst
[1:56:21] was quenched.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When I had spiritual thirst,
[1:56:26] my thirst was quenched. And I say, glory
[1:56:29] to God. Nobody has to tell me I wasn't
[1:56:32] thirsty. I was thirsty. Nobody has to
[1:56:35] tell you you're thirsty. You know if
[1:56:37] you're thirsty and if you're thirsty say
[1:56:39] I can reach through to the high priest
[1:56:43] Jesus Christ and have my thirst
[1:56:46] quenched.
[1:56:49] How old do I have to be? How old are you
[1:56:52] to be thirsty?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; How old do you have to be to be thirsty?
[1:56:56] How old do you have to be to know that
[1:56:58] your thirst is quenched? How old you
[1:57:00] have to be to have a drink? I tell you
[1:57:02] there's no age. How old How old do you
[1:57:04] have to be before you want it? If maybe
[1:57:06] you're dying breath, I want it.
[1:57:11] My wife stood beside her. Daddy,
[1:57:14] he had no pain. He wasn't sick. He just
[1:57:18] was leaving this world of old age.
[1:57:23] She knew. She knew as a daughter that he
[1:57:26] liked ice cream.
[1:57:29] Oh, don't give him ice cream. That's the
[1:57:30] last thing in the world you want. That
[1:57:32] doesn't matter.
[1:57:35] This is his daughter. He likes ice
[1:57:37] cream.
[1:57:39] So she stood beside his bed, got a
[1:57:41] little ice cream, and that's some of
[1:57:44] that was the last food he had. A little
[1:57:47] bit of ice cream. Cuz he liked ice
[1:57:49] cream. Did it feed his soul? No. No. No.
[1:57:52] I dealt with the soul years before.
[1:57:58] Ice cream is not soul food.
[1:58:02] But revelation of this is soul food.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; And when you hear a voice,
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; I if you read it is the rising of the
[1:58:10] sun and I trust you did, you don't have
[1:58:13] to have me up here to tell you that come
[1:58:15] out of that was a divine message that
[1:58:18] come from God. No man could speak those
[1:58:21] things. And again today, he said, "And
[1:58:24] again today, it must be waved according
[1:58:28] to Luke 17:30." because Luke 17:30 was a
[1:58:32] prophecy by Jesus Christ when he was
[1:58:34] here on earth and that had to be
[1:58:36] fulfilled. And now you have the vessel
[1:58:39] uh who's representing the son of man. He
[1:58:42] is a son of man revealing the son of man
[1:58:46] and he's saying and again today it has
[1:58:48] to be fulfilled. Why? Because the word
[1:58:51] had come to full maturity.
[1:58:59] And then people want to be sus raise
[1:59:02] some suspicion said well how was he
[1:59:04] killed?
[1:59:08] One minister came to my house years ago
[1:59:11] and I had great respect for him
[1:59:15] and he wanted to dislodge my confidence
[1:59:18] in the message.
[1:59:21] He said, "Why was William Brandham
[1:59:24] killed in that tragic accident?"
[1:59:28] And I looked him in the face and I said,
[1:59:31] "Why was John the Baptist beheaded?"
[1:59:34] Because a little girl danced.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; He opened his mouth
[1:59:42] and no air even came out.
[1:59:49] Why was Jesus crucified?
[1:59:53] Why were the disciples? Why were the
[1:59:55] prophets Was Jesus lying when he said
[1:59:57] they've all been killed? You killed them
[1:59:59] all.
[2:00:02] Nice to see you, Jason. God bless you. I
[2:00:05] was I was I was always expecting to see
[2:00:07] you over here and I was thinking about
[2:00:09] you yesterday and I said, I haven't seen
[2:00:11] Jason. Have to excuse me. I'm happy to
[2:00:13] see Jason. You've uplifted my heart.
[2:00:16] Amen.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; So, it's not up to me to ask, you know,
[2:00:21] why was he killed? All I can say is that
[2:00:24] the word came to maturity.
[2:00:27] His part was done.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; I could shock you a little bit. It's
[2:00:36] this prophet that said,
[2:00:39] this prophet said,
[2:00:44] I want you to say, what did he say?
[2:00:47] This prophet said that to go and drink
[2:00:50] and become drunk and go out and drive in
[2:00:53] a car and kill somebody is firstdegree
[2:00:57] murder.
[2:00:58] How many How many know he said that? How
[2:01:01] many know he said that?
[2:01:05] And a man did exactly that and drove
[2:01:08] down the highway
[2:01:11] and head with one headlight on and came
[2:01:13] across and smashed into William
[2:01:16] Brandham's car head on. And he died as a
[2:01:20] result of that.
[2:01:22] How did he die? First-degree murder.
[2:01:26] Five states
[2:01:29] some time ago. Five states in the United
[2:01:32] States of America have adopted that.
[2:01:38] You're sitting real quiet.
[2:01:43] I don't care how he went.
[2:01:48] Jesus was crucified. That's up to them.
[2:01:52] That's up to them.
[2:01:55] And you might not understand what I said
[2:01:57] some years ago. And I'll say it again.
[2:01:59] I'll repeat it again and perhaps raise
[2:02:01] the same eyebrows. The Roman soldier who
[2:02:04] thrust his spear. The iron that he was
[2:02:08] on the cross put in the ground
[2:02:12] with a stick wood stick from a tree that
[2:02:15] he the creator allowed to grow.
[2:02:20] and the and they're
[2:02:25] breathing the air
[2:02:29] that God gave them to breathe
[2:02:32] and thrusting that spear into the Savior
[2:02:36] and out came blood and water. Is that
[2:02:38] right?
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; He did us a favor.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; He gave us a savior,
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; but he condemned himself.
[2:02:50] and gave me a savior.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; There is no weapon that is formed
[2:02:57] against thee that shall prosper. No
[2:03:01] spear, no sword, no accusation, no
[2:03:05] nothing can prosper against the son or
[2:03:08] daughter of God. Hallelujah. elect of
[2:03:11] God, called by God, sent a messenger and
[2:03:16] waved over the people to let you know
[2:03:19] the word, children, that is fulfilled.
[2:03:22] That's already happened.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Now, we can just expect the next event.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:03:33] He's waved over the people.
[2:03:37] And for those of you that may stream or
[2:03:40] hear the service at a in Lima, I want to
[2:03:45] speak this in Lima. I want to take it
[2:03:48] just one more step and I won't take the
[2:03:50] time now because I can't do it justice.
[2:03:53] But you are the first fruits.
[2:03:56] First fruits. The disciples that came
[2:03:59] out were the first fruits of the word.
[2:04:06] The believers of this message, you have
[2:04:08] the honor, you have the great privilege
[2:04:12] to be the first fruits. And it's written
[2:04:14] all through the scripture. You are the
[2:04:17] first fruits. Listen to me. I'm not just
[2:04:19] preaching. I'm te making a declaration.
[2:04:22] You are the first fruits because you
[2:04:24] have come out. You You don't have to
[2:04:26] duplicate everything that the message
[2:04:28] did. You You're believers of it. And
[2:04:32] it's waved before God. It was waved
[2:04:35] before God. Luke 17:30 who came out of
[2:04:39] the word lips of Jesus Christ. Jesus
[2:04:42] Christ and his priesthood.
[2:04:46] Hearing all that, seeing the people
[2:04:47] come. There they come. There they come.
[2:04:50] The promised seed. They've come. It was
[2:04:54] waved over them that they would come.
[2:04:56] Here they come. Here's the evidence of
[2:04:58] it. I'm evidence of it. We're evidence
[2:05:01] of it. I'm evidence that the I'm
[2:05:04] evidence that the sheath has been waved.
[2:05:06] Hallelujah. And we're the first fruits
[2:05:08] of that waving. Hallelujah. God bless
[2:05:11] you. I want to I want to sing a a little
[2:05:15] chorus.
[2:05:17] And uh it's just the chorus of a a song.
[2:05:20] I don't know the song,
[2:05:23] but it has to do with
[2:05:27] touching Jesus is all that really
[2:05:30] matters. How many know it?
[2:05:32] Thank you. Thank you.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; All right. I want you all that know it
[2:05:36] to sing up real loud.
[2:05:40] And you those of you that know it and
[2:05:43] those of you that don't know it,
[2:05:46] I'd like to ask you a question.
[2:05:51] Do you think you need to touch him?
[2:06:03] I'm standing be beside a very very about
[2:06:07] your height brother Nathan Hilderbrand.
[2:06:10] If you just stand up so people can see
[2:06:12] how tall this brother was. That's about
[2:06:15] the height and about the size a slender
[2:06:18] man like about Nathan. Thank you,
[2:06:20] brother Nathan.
[2:06:21] And I was standing beside him about
[2:06:25] here.
[2:06:28] and he's standing on this side.
[2:06:32] He was a pastor in Grand Prairie,
[2:06:34] Alberta.
[2:06:36] Paul Cornish was his name.
[2:06:40] And the meetings were held first in
[2:06:41] Grand Prairie and now it was in Dawson
[2:06:43] Creek.
[2:06:45] And I have questions. Oh, have I got
[2:06:48] questions?
[2:06:50] I haven't got an absolute on the
[2:06:51] Godhead. I didn't have an absolute on
[2:06:53] the baptism. And I certainly couldn't
[2:06:56] see the serpent seat in the scripture.
[2:06:59] And I'm standing there with all these
[2:07:01] questions. Don't move about people,
[2:07:03] please.
[2:07:06] The service isn't over. Now we're coming
[2:07:08] to an important part.
[2:07:11] And here stands God's messenger.
[2:07:16] And somebody's in front of him. I don't
[2:07:18] know who.
[2:07:19] It doesn't even doesn't even come around
[2:07:22] my mind. And the prayer line goes to the
[2:07:25] wall of the auditorium and all the way
[2:07:28] down.
[2:07:31] There's probably at least 40 50 people
[2:07:34] in the prayer line
[2:07:36] and brother Brennham is standing there
[2:07:38] and I'm going to duplicate what
[2:07:39] happened. So don't get scared. He raised
[2:07:41] his voice.
[2:07:44] I don't know what he's saying to this
[2:07:46] woman or this man. I don't know who it
[2:07:49] is.
[2:07:51] And he's just talking to them like that.
[2:07:54] And then he goes like this. The boy will
[2:07:57] be all right.
[2:08:01] Took me a second to get what was said.
[2:08:04] The boy will be all right.
[2:08:07] I was standing here
[2:08:09] and a force
[2:08:12] I can't explain. It's from another
[2:08:13] world. A force just went past me like
[2:08:16] the force of an earthquake or something.
[2:08:18] Just
[2:08:21] no sound.
[2:08:23] But I was deeply affected. And this man
[2:08:27] right beside me, he went like this
[2:08:31] and he began to sob and his shoulders.
[2:08:34] This man, you couldn't hardly get a tear
[2:08:36] out of him. This man was an eloquent
[2:08:39] scholar.
[2:08:41] This man went to Seattle and became a
[2:08:43] Bible school teacher.
[2:08:45] And he is he's he's shaking. And I don't
[2:08:49] know what happened. I I'm like the
[2:08:50] disciples.
[2:08:52] I What happened? What did he say? What?
[2:08:56] What's happening? I'm in total
[2:08:59] confusion.
[2:09:01] And this man, it was like he got hit in
[2:09:04] the head with a hammer. He just keeled
[2:09:06] over like that instantly.
[2:09:10] And he straightened up after a moment.
[2:09:12] He touched me on my shoulder. He said,
[2:09:15] "Brother Eddie,"
[2:09:17] he said, "See down the prayer line, down
[2:09:19] towards the end of the prayer line. See
[2:09:22] that young young lad, young boy? He was
[2:09:25] about 14 or 15 years old." He said,
[2:09:28] "That's my son."
[2:09:30] And he's up for a serious operation next
[2:09:33] week
[2:09:35] and he's in the prayer line. He would
[2:09:37] never have made it to brother Brandham.
[2:09:44] This man,
[2:09:46] as far as I know, he doesn't believe the
[2:09:48] message.
[2:09:50] Multitudes of those that were in the
[2:09:53] meetings didn't become believers.
[2:09:57] But something, and brother Bam talked
[2:10:00] about this something, he touched someone
[2:10:05] in another place.
[2:10:08] He touched he so touched the high
[2:10:11] priest. The high priest that was
[2:10:14] actually resident with this prophet's
[2:10:18] ministry
[2:10:20] caused him to cry out the boy will be
[2:10:23] all right.
[2:10:30] When I hear that, when I've experienced
[2:10:32] that,
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; I'm affected
[2:10:36] because you and I sit here, you're
[2:10:38] believers.
[2:10:40] Don't just be nice believers.
[2:10:42] But when you need to touch him, I have a
[2:10:45] need. It's such a crushing need. It's
[2:10:48] such an agonizing need. Just remember,
[2:10:51] you're not far from touching him.
[2:10:54] You need to touch him.
[2:10:57] Touching Jesus is all that really
[2:10:59] matters. I wonder, could you sing a
[2:11:02] praise Brian for me?
[2:11:03] Touching Jesus
[2:11:07] is all that matterers.
[2:11:14] And your life will never be
[2:11:19] the same.
[2:11:24] and make
[2:11:27] our way.
[2:11:53] And your life will never be
[2:11:58] the same.
[2:12:22] Jesus
[2:12:24] in all that matter
[2:12:31] and your I will be
[2:12:36] the
[2:12:41] only
[2:12:44] one way.
[2:12:50] Just
[2:12:53] call
[2:12:55] his name.
[2:12:58] You know, a preacher has to believe what
[2:13:00] he preaches.
[2:13:04] You know, I have hearing aids.
[2:13:06] My hearing is not really good and I
[2:13:09] don't have good tone sound. That's why I
[2:13:11] have other people saying
[2:13:14] I just so desire.
[2:13:16] I'm one that sang, we sang together,
[2:13:19] etc., etc. And for me not to be able to,
[2:13:21] it's a really uh very, very difficult
[2:13:24] burden in life.
[2:13:26] I'm not asking for any sympathy. if you
[2:13:29] have faith, you can pray for me.
[2:13:34] But this last week, I had to go to a
[2:13:36] very very specialist and I went there
[2:13:38] because I said I want to have my tone
[2:13:41] back.
[2:13:43] So I put different all kinds of
[2:13:45] instruments and testimon testings and I
[2:13:47] I've been told years ago I can't have it
[2:13:50] can't have it back. And so while they're
[2:13:52] doing their examination everything, they
[2:13:54] said this this hearing device has to go
[2:13:56] back to the factory. It's deceptive.
[2:14:00] Okay. I give it to them.
[2:14:03] So, right away I was asked, "Are you
[2:14:05] still going to preach Sunday?" Yep.
[2:14:08] I'm going to preach Sunday. I will not
[2:14:11] I'm not going to allow some gadget to
[2:14:13] stop me. Did you hear me? All right. I'm
[2:14:16] sure you did.
[2:14:20] So, he tries to he tries to interfere
[2:14:22] with the preacher's work.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; He tries to interfere with the message.
[2:14:28] because I've been studying for probably
[2:14:31] a month or two and I say I just want
[2:14:34] this is this is for Lima. I've told you
[2:14:36] here in the church this is for Lima. And
[2:14:39] then over a week ago I contact Brother
[2:14:41] Tom and said I feel that I'm to say this
[2:14:46] this morning in the message.
[2:14:48] So I know I know there's somebody
[2:14:52] that's here that needs to touch him.
[2:14:56] We had Sister Deborah Hilderbrine's
[2:14:58] testimony,
[2:15:02] how God answered her prayer and answered
[2:15:05] her need.
[2:15:07] I wonder how many needs there are.
[2:15:11] Really urgent needs that you have. We're
[2:15:14] going to pray in a few moments.
[2:15:20] Just hold it up.
[2:15:26] Now I want to ask you while your hand is
[2:15:28] up. Do you really believe you believe
[2:15:31] this word?
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; You believe he would answer you?
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, he will.
[2:15:41] While your hand is held up,
[2:15:43] would you sing again, please, brother
[2:15:45] Ryan?
[2:15:50] Touching Jesus
[2:15:53] is all
[2:15:55] that really matterers.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; And your life will never be
[2:16:07] the same.
[2:16:12] And there's only
[2:16:16] one way
[2:16:18] to touch him.
[2:16:23] Just believe
[2:16:26] when you call on
[2:16:29] his name.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; Dear gracious and loving heavenly
[2:16:35] father, you are our father. We come
[2:16:39] forth from you. We are a we are a result
[2:16:42] of your seed. We believe upon you. We
[2:16:46] believe upon him whom you have sent. We
[2:16:50] believe upon our Lord Jesus Christ. We
[2:16:52] believe in the revealing of him in this
[2:16:55] day that you have done. You have
[2:16:57] achieved it. You've accomplished it
[2:16:59] through your messenger, your prophet,
[2:17:01] your servant. And how thankful we are,
[2:17:04] oh God, that we have been called by a
[2:17:08] voice and we have indeed heard the voice
[2:17:11] and you've called us. We do not know
[2:17:13] entirely or precisely why you have
[2:17:16] called us. You've called us to fulfill a
[2:17:18] certain purpose and Satan has come and
[2:17:21] tried to put obstacles in the way. He's
[2:17:24] tried to bring hindrances. He's tried to
[2:17:27] make us un ineffective. But we resist
[2:17:30] him in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan
[2:17:33] has tried to bring disease and
[2:17:36] affliction and sickness upon people. And
[2:17:39] oh God, I resist it. I resist the
[2:17:42] hearing loss that I've experienced. I
[2:17:45] resist everything that the people have
[2:17:47] experienced, the infirmities. Oh God,
[2:17:50] and we believe in Jesus Christ who is
[2:17:53] the answer to every affliction. And if
[2:17:56] he that is afflicted, let him pray. And
[2:17:59] if they are sick, let them call for the
[2:18:02] elders of the church. Let them pray the
[2:18:04] prayer of faith. Oh God, we believe,
[2:18:08] Father, in those that in those promises
[2:18:11] they are yay and amen to everyone that
[2:18:14] believeth. Father, I pray for every
[2:18:17] burden that laid upon the hearts or lays
[2:18:20] upon the hearts of the individuals as
[2:18:23] they raise their hand to you. Oh God, I
[2:18:27] raise my hands to you, Lord, knowing
[2:18:30] that you are not only someone that
[2:18:33] knows, but you're someone that is has
[2:18:35] the compassion and you heal the fever
[2:18:39] and then you raised the dead. You did
[2:18:42] all manner of things. You straightened
[2:18:44] up the woman and bent over. Oh God, you
[2:18:48] did all of these things. Those are
[2:18:49] physical things, but more than that,
[2:18:52] you've opened your word. You've opened
[2:18:54] our minds. You've opened our
[2:18:56] understanding. We thank you for the
[2:18:58] anointing of the hour, oh God. Oh God,
[2:19:02] thank you for the resurrection of this
[2:19:04] time. Ah that you've resurrected us from
[2:19:07] the dead denominationalism
[2:19:10] and brought us, oh God, to a living
[2:19:12] faith. How we thank you that we can be
[2:19:14] part of the family of God. And I commit
[2:19:18] this people to you, Lord. I commit them
[2:19:20] to you in a way that they did not enter
[2:19:23] the building that they that they exit
[2:19:26] the building free.
[2:19:28] Free that they can say I'm free and whom
[2:19:32] the sun sets free is free indeed. And I
[2:19:36] pray, oh God, as the days go on and life
[2:19:39] is extended, that you'll make this
[2:19:41] people a powerful witness and testimony
[2:19:47] throughout the earth in Jesus Christ's
[2:19:50] name. Thank you, Lord. We want to love
[2:19:52] you.
[2:19:56] We want to love you. Show our faith and
[2:19:59] confidence in you. I commit this people
[2:20:02] to you in Jesus name.
[2:20:05] Amen.
[2:20:06] Amen.
[2:20:08] Touching Jesus,
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; touching Jesus
[2:20:15] is all that matterers
[2:20:22] and your life will ever be
[2:20:27] the day.
[2:20:32] and the glory
[2:20:37] such
[2:20:44] when you call
[2:20:47] his name
[2:20:52] Jesus
[2:20:54] is all that we
[2:20:59] call Your life will never
[2:21:09] power and there's only
[2:21:13] one way to
[2:21:28] friends just to make it personal to
[2:21:31] I was sitting in a restaurant just
[2:21:32] having a quick bite to eat with my wife
[2:21:34] yesterday
[2:21:36] and I had to grab my pen,
[2:21:39] take a piece of paper that was out in
[2:21:42] front of me and tear off a piece of
[2:21:44] newspaper
[2:21:46] and I had to start writing these words.
[2:21:49] Who did he touch? Who did she touch?
[2:21:53] They touched the high priest. They
[2:21:55] touched the high priest. And God was
[2:21:57] impressing upon me and inspiring me that
[2:22:00] this very part, this is the part.
[2:22:02] There's somebody there's somebody in
[2:22:04] this service. There's several people in
[2:22:06] this service. I don't know who and I
[2:22:09] don't need I don't need the the glamour
[2:22:11] of your hands or anything else. I want
[2:22:14] to announce to you somebody needs to
[2:22:16] touch him and somebody can touch him.
[2:22:19] God wants me to tell you you can touch
[2:22:22] him. He is touchable. And furthermore,
[2:22:26] we have not a high priest that cannot be
[2:22:29] touched with the feeling of our
[2:22:30] infirmities that you, you, you, and you
[2:22:34] up there and you on the internet, you
[2:22:37] have the privilege of touching this high
[2:22:41] priest. He became priest for you. He
[2:22:45] entered that priesthood for the
[2:22:47] believers. It's not for us just to go
[2:22:49] through life. He touched he he became He
[2:22:53] entered a place that we could reach
[2:22:54] through. You as a believer can reach
[2:22:57] through to that dimension and touch him.
[2:23:04] How about having a servant of God cry
[2:23:07] out, "It's over."
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your sin will be fine.
[2:23:14] Hallelujah. Your situation is solved.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody touch him. Well, if
[2:23:20] you think it's impossible, that's the
[2:23:22] devil telling you that it's not
[2:23:24] impossible. I give my life to him.
[2:23:28] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God.
[2:23:33] I call the promises of God until we as
[2:23:36] one mass of people believe it with all
[2:23:39] of our heart. It's not impossible.
[2:23:42] This high priest has the answer.
[2:23:45] Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory. Oh,
[2:23:49] touching Jesus is all that really
[2:23:51] matters.
[2:23:54] touching Jesus
[2:23:56] is all that really matterers
[2:24:03] and your life will never be
[2:24:12] and there's only
[2:24:16] one way.
[2:24:18] Touch him.
[2:24:20] Oh, touch him.
[2:24:31] If you're here and you're tormented and
[2:24:34] you're tormented by the enemy, maybe not
[2:24:37] physically, but mentally, I'm tormented
[2:24:39] by Satan. Let me tell you, Satan has no
[2:24:42] right to your mind. Satan has no right
[2:24:45] to lie to the children of God. And Jesus
[2:24:49] rejected him and resisted him because
[2:24:52] there's no truth in him.
[2:24:55] Don't listen to the devil. Listen to the
[2:24:58] word of God.
[2:25:01] Oh, touching Jesus.
[2:25:03] touching Jesus
[2:25:06] in all that matter
[2:25:13] and
[2:25:15] car.
[2:25:29] Oh God,
[2:25:33] when you come
[2:25:36] in
[2:25:38] just
[2:25:42] to
[2:25:47] hallelujah
[2:25:49] and my life will never be
[2:25:53] the same.
[2:25:58] That is
[2:26:01] why
[2:26:04] only one way to touch it.
[2:26:07] That's
[2:26:09] when you
[2:26:12] call on his name.
[2:26:17] But you change
[2:26:19] all that
[2:26:25] and your life will never be
[2:26:40] I am
[2:26:42] want to touch him That's
[2:26:46] when you
[2:26:51] get when you have me down
[2:27:00] to touch you
[2:27:11] and
[2:27:14] Everybody
[2:27:17] say
[2:27:33] all that matter
[2:27:39] and your life will
[2:27:42] Jesus
[2:27:57] be
[2:28:06] touching Jesus
[2:28:09] in all
[2:28:15] and your life.
[2:28:19] Hallelujah.
[2:28:31] your name.
[2:28:38] We bless your name, oh God.
[2:28:41] We bless your name. We bless your name.
[2:28:44] Hallelujah. That's all that matters.
[2:28:48] That's all that matters is believe. When
[2:28:50] you call on his name, believe.
[2:28:54] Glory to God. We are believers. I wonder
[2:28:58] who wants to raise their hand. Say, "I'm
