Just want to pray that God would step in and do work on her behalf. Also, a testimony from my brother Norm. A week and a half ago on Sunday, I had a strange sick feeling. It continued on and off through the following Monday. And Monday night while he was working at the school, it got worse. He decided it was best to go home and have the brothers pray for him. He says, "I started feeling better at home and was back at the school working Tuesday night. I thank God for his grace and healing." Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother Norm. Amen.

And those that can't come, I'm sure some are streaming. We're just so thankful for his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. I wonder if we couldn't sing a little chorus, too. Brother Ryan, uh, I'm standing. We're standing on holy ground. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, that's the way I felt Sunday. &gt;&gt; Been feeling it ever since. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you haven't uh haven't kind of kicked in, it's like you're getting turbocharged. the afterburners. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to have some spiritual afterburners one of these days and go straight up. Nice to see you, brother Arie. Know you weren't feeling too well for a few days and feeling better now. Good. Good. All right, let's just sing now. We're standing on holy ground. We are standing [Music] on holy ground and I know that there are angels around you. Oh God of [Music] Jesus. We are in his presence of holy ground. God with all your heart with all your heart. [Music] You are my [Music] angels. [Music] Jesus Christ. We are standing. [Music] Amen. I'll have you take your Bibles and turn to John's Gospel. the seventh chapter. For those of you that were here uh last Wednesday and Sunday uh some of the things I'm going to going to rehearse going to cover over some of the things because there was I just realized you know and sometimes I apologize but I realize there was just a lot of material and u uh we want to make sure that everyone has opportunity to absorb uh I I feel for myself. I just want to be very honest with you. I It's like a turning point for me. &gt;&gt; It was like a key that opened up. I I never had experience quite like that. And it just opened up from Genesis to Revelation. Just it began to affect everything. And we know that the prophet's message is sent here to reveal Christ. And when something really uh is inspired, it should open this up. Amen. &gt;&gt; It should tie it together, &gt;&gt; things you've wondered about and things that were maybe loose ends should just all start coming together. And so I was having an experience like that and I just want to be able to share it more with you uh in John's gospel the 7th chapter. I'm just going to read two verses. In the last day, this is verse 37:38. In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink. &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like to have been there that day and heard him. I'd like to have heard Jesus lift up his voice on the last day, the great day of the feast. It was a special time. It was also a special feast. And that's when he was crying out. Just while you're still standing, we'll just bow reverently for a moment together. Father, we're standing here together in this sanctuary. And as we have sung a course, we believe the words. There are angels all around. And your prophet has said who he was so connected with the invisible. And he said that they are here. They're here to influence. You can feel their influence. May we, oh God, and all who may be connected and listening by the streaming wherever they might be. May we all feel the influence of the heavenly beings. May we be under the direct influence of the Holy Spirit from within, oh God, and around us, Lord. And if the enemy has come in like a flood, then raise up a standard against him, oh God. I pray that you'll cleanse the minds of all the busy thoughts of the day, for they are not as important as your thought. We just pray your blessing, oh God, not only blessing but inspiration upon the speaker and the hearers alike in the name of Jesus Christ and for his glory alone we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your seats. The scripture which we just read said that Jesus stood and cried saying. There's been a lot of uh great things that have been spoken and there have been what the world has said or considered at least they've considered great men have spoken and things which they have spoken have been recorded remembered for even centuries. people who have been considered philosophers, wise men. And whenever we think of that, just remember that the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. And you can take something that is so simple that God has spoken. It may be ultra simple and yet it keeps it keeps expanding and it keeps getting deeper in its its depth and you'll find out that it begins to connect with other things and it it has a profound effect upon your life and uh those of us who perhaps have remembered uh remembered something that's been said to us. I remember when brother Benny Perry was here uh ministering some years ago and uh and and his mother was taken and uh from them and uh he said and and left the children. There was a four of them I believe and she talked to the those boys and talked to him and his brother and she said don't you ever take drugs and she had to talk with man don't you ever take anything that doesn't belong to you. Now that's not very profound but that kept two sons out of a whole heap of trouble because that was what they remembered that mama had said. don't you ever take anything that doesn't belong to you and don't you ever take drugs and they stayed away from it &gt;&gt; and God bless them for it. &gt;&gt; So I think that that is wonderful. Uh now we want to speak about I want to turn your thoughts to the things that Jesus said. And on uh on Sunday we we took the scripture. Um and Jesus said unto them, "Verily I say unto you that you which have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of his glory, you also shall sit upon 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel." What a statement. What a thing to be spoken. Now, for those of us uh the day that we're living in today, uh God has again spoken. &gt;&gt; You realize that we've had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years and even into a couple thousand years since Jesus was here. And then he prophesied. He said it very briefly. When you see the days of Noah again and when you see the days of Sodom again, even thus shall it be when the Son of Man who he had made himself known as the Son of Man is revealed. He didn't say how he would do it. He didn't say right then, I'm going to send the Spirit of Elijah. He didn't say then who he was or anything. And and the scriptures never identified. They said to John the Baptist, who are you? He said, "I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness as the scripture said." Well, the scripture could have been more specific, but God chose not to be specific. John could have been more specific, but the Holy Spirit led him not to be so specific because we don't need to catch it by learning. We need to catch it by a a divine revelation. We have to know that a thought is being injected into not our mind to turn over turn over and and to uh but but our into our inner being into our soul. And so we are living in a day when God has spoken his own word through his own messenger, his own elected one. And these are days which we can identify as the spoken word. So now I have a question perhaps two questions but the question is is the word of God only uh is the word of God only expression of God's knowledge of a situation and certain conditions or is the word of God something that is pregnantated with with creative powers &gt;&gt; that's very very important for usmen So is the word of God only an expression of God's knowledge? Is God just expanding our knowledge? Getting a greater understanding? You know, I have uh I have several volumes, four of them, four volumes of the what is called the Bible encyclopedia. And it's really fine print. You need to have good eyes. And they are literally about uh 2 and 1/2 3 in thick each. They cover about that much of my bookshelf and all fine print and there'd be thousands of pages. And if you had it in normal print, it would be many hundreds of more pages. And when I read it, I just marvel that there are men that can be so analytical and put everything together and they they go on and on and on on certain subjects and other subjects which really the message considers them very important. They'll just have a small paragraph, but then they'll get on to other things like they go for pages on the Trinity. And of course, the Trinity needs pages because they're trying to explain it. They really need a lot of space. But then other subjects which I have found extremely important in the message. It'll just be a paragraph. But they did pretty good on the regeneration. But then they go on and what what it was in the Old Testament or what it was in the New Testament and how the apostles look at it. and they focus everything down just to u uh just to I won't say just to but to salvation and that is the regeneration that is when a person has a new life etc etc and of course uh I marvel that they you know they can tie all the scriptures together and all of these things but what I really marvel at brother Brandham can take a few paragraphs and just I tell you what blow all of that to pieces &gt;&gt; you know I I don't say that dis disrespectfully. I say blow it to pieces cuz they haven't even caught that. &gt;&gt; They have they don't even think of that. &gt;&gt; And then I was reading back and Brother Vam starts talking about the cell of the body and I will I'll be going into it. I have a quote. I want you to read it with me and and he'll go into the cell of the body and how we're structured and put together and all of those things and then project that into into the supernatural and into the spiritual. And if we came out of if we came out of our earthly father, then we came out of our heavenly father and and the thing just becomes so one wonderful and it's it's just a it just is a so mindblowing really. I mean I run out of mental space. I run out of mental space all the time and I guess you probably know that. But anyway, my question is, is God when he speaks his word, is he only giving them or giving the people or giving us a greater knowledge of situation of conditions of the world or or is there something further? And I and and I'm going to say that I firmly believe and I'm absolutely convinced that God's words are pregnantated with a creative power. &gt;&gt; God can take control of a situation and heal a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that same word can take control of a person and create something. &gt;&gt; And it has to be creative power. Now I'm just jumping way ahead so I can come back. If you read uh we know that the breach and revelation the fifth chapter and the the book that was sealed and no one was worthy to take the book or to even look upon it. We we know those those truths very well. I just want to point out one thing to you. In the fifth chapter, we have the angels singing and the elders and the living creatures crying out and saying, "Thou art worthy to take the book. Thou art worthy and because thou was slain. And and you have the angels singing and the people making these acclamations to Christ to the lamb, but you don't have there's no record that the lamb said anything. He was silent all through chapter 5. When you get to chapter 10 and the and the mighty angel which is Christ himself has descended and and the Bible says that he had in his hand now a little book that was open and now because the book was open and he cried &gt;&gt; with a great voice and seven thunders uttered their voices and so now we are having uh it it doesn't take a very intelligent person to determine that the opening of the book uh created and caused a voice, &gt;&gt; a great voice. &gt;&gt; And I could take you, the Bible says on the last day of the feast, that was the feast of tabernacles. &gt;&gt; These are our tabernacles. At the feast of tabernacles, where there was a celebration, something is supposed to happen with your tabernacle. Let me tell you while you sit here. Some of you young, strong, handsome, beautiful, all the rest of it, but your tabernacle's changing. &gt;&gt; And it won't be the same next year that it is today or maybe even tomorrow the way it is today. Your tabernacle's changing. And you can do everything you want to keep it young, to keep the wrinkles away, to keep yourself strong and keep yourself nevertheless, you can run. You can do all of these things. But your tabernacles changing &gt;&gt; and we want it to change in the right direction. &gt;&gt; We are interested in a feast of tabernacles. I want a feast with you &gt;&gt; as being a younger person or a stronger person or an older person. I want a feast with you in being what God intended for you to be &gt;&gt; and the body he intended you to have &gt;&gt; the feast of the tabernacles. And no no wonder at that feast that Jesus cried with a loud voice if any man thirst let him come unto me. &gt;&gt; What was that? It was an invitation. &gt;&gt; And that's what Peter was saying. Now if you can just put the two together. Peter was saying, "We've left everything. We've left houses and lands and relatives and everything. We've left home. We've left father. We've left our our occupation. We've left everything. What shall we have?" Jesus said, "You that have been with me, you that have followed me in their season, they followed him." And that was in the regeneration. He was the beginning of the creation of God. And you've been with me in this time. Well, it's that was not allotted to us, but it's been allotted to us to be in this time &gt;&gt; when he has experienced the second crucifixion &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. When this word that you love and dearly love, people despise and say all manner of things. Doesn't bother me at all. Doesn't bother us, &gt;&gt; but it happens. &gt;&gt; And he was rejected &gt;&gt; because it's the same Christ. We're not talking about brother Brandham even though he had to suffer because he was the vessel. &gt;&gt; He said it's not me they hate us the message. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; But it has been given to us to be with him in this time. &gt;&gt; It's been given to us to be with him in the rapture season. What a wonderful honor. What a privilege it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and that and we were we were with him and what shall we have? We just hear his words. You'll not all sleep, &gt;&gt; but you will all be changed &gt;&gt; in a moment in the twinkling. You that have been with me in this season &gt;&gt; because that is this season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've been with me in this season and this is what you'll have as a reward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Take the whole world. Give me Jesus and that promise. &gt;&gt; We've been called of God to be partakers of the fulfillment of the scripture of this day. Father, as as Jesus prayed and we quoted it last Sunday, I will that they also whom thou hast given me. He didn't allot adjust to those that were there with him, but those that thou hast given me, that they be with me where I am, and they may behold my glory which thou hast given me. Perhaps I will just uh we will go over some of the slides because I have also some uh added one. And Jesus said unto them, you can read it with me. Uh Jesus said unto them, verily I say unto you, that you which have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit upon 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel. and for regeneration. I want to take a little more time with this because uh it deserves more time to form again to bring something back to its original state. Anything that's just been before it hasn't been original to its original state. And the restoration of a thing regeneration is the restoration of a thing to its pristine state. Hence its renovation. It's the new birth. It's the restoration to the original and perfect condition of things which existed before the fall of our parents. And brother Brennham stated so much and it's in the seals and the breach especially. He said all that Adam lost Jesus Christ restored. He gave back all that Adam lost. Regeneration is from the word Genesis. It is uh the generation. Regeneration is a generation or the source or the origin, a book of one's lineage in which his ancestry or progeny are enumerated. And I brought out I've thought about it many many times and marveled at it and have spoken on it how the book of Matthew, it's so striking. The book of Matthew starts out the book the the generation of Jesus Christ and it does not does it does not make it plural. If you want to I'll just read it for you. The book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham. Now just watch for a moment. You don't mind we take a little time. You don't you can just note it down if you want. But in Genesis 5, it begins to right starting with verse one. This is the book of the generations of Adam. Now that was the first Adam. This is the second Adam. The first Adam had generations. The second Adam has only one generation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyone is a firstborn son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it goes on to say uh how long the days of Adam where. And it talks about the generations. You'll find it many places in the Bible, but this is just the book of the generation. There you have it. Matthew 1:1, the book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. In the Leodysian church age, we have this paragraph. He's the beginning of the creation of God. And how could God be created? That he's a spirit. How could he be? He is eternal. He never was created. He never will be created because he was God at the beginning. But he that is uh but he that is the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ when he was made manifest when God lived in him. Now this is a a a new slide here. Now if I had to take one single little cell that every one of you come from one little teeny cell germ please notice where this is 1953. What is a germ? A germ is a little tiny, the smallest of cell. Well, what's after that? Now, I've took you down from every piece of you down to this one little cell, and I haven't found you yet. &gt;&gt; I just got your cells laid out. You can get you can get the string of the DNA and they can draw diagrams of it, but they'll they won't find you there. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, you have a prophet that looks into the invisible, into the unseen, and he says, "I I broke it all down. I've got you down. You're you're sitting here with a somewhere between 10 and 100 trillion cells. And now you've got one that's speaking on behalf of the creator says, "I've got you down to one cell." &gt;&gt; I've got you down to one cell. You can't even see it with your naked eye. I've got you down to one cell and I haven't found you yet. &gt;&gt; You talk about a creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I also emphasizing what kind of a messenger that God brought you and I. We're not we're we have no reason to feel like stuffed church friends. &gt;&gt; We're we ought to be very humbled people &gt;&gt; that God would send this kind of a messenger. &gt;&gt; So that you could understand things. You'll never hear this from Plato or someone else. &gt;&gt; You'll never hear it in Darwin's theory. You'll never catch it in a Bible school. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "And I have I just I've got your cells laid out." Well, then he said, "The next thing, blood cells and flesh cells and whatever they are, laying them all out here, but I haven't got you yet. He is God's creation." Speaking of Jesus Christ, the first and the last, the amen, the beginning of the creation of God. When God created himself a body, he came down and lived in it. And that's the beginning of the creation of God. Oh, isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; All right. See that is okay. I want to go on to leadership here where there's only one form of eternal life and that life comes from God. and he for ordained every creature that would ever have it. And just as you were the gene in your father, you were a gene in God. Now, I uh I think it's important. I'm not trying to be uh I'm not that, you know, I'm not trying to get all technical, but I I've thought about it as I've read and done some studying. And the way brother Brennham has said it now he talks about the cells because the gene the gene is actually the nature. The gene is the it is the carrier of the character or nature of a person. The gene is not the cell. The gene the cell is your is the living organism as I understand it. And then but the gene is it is the the the makeup of the person. It is the carrier they say the unit of carrier of hereditary what you've inherited from your uh parents or greatgrandparents or whatever more. And so as you were a gene in your father you were a gene in God. One of his attributes. So now you're a carrier of his attributes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His attributes. We speak about his attributes. His attributes, excuse me, friends, are your attributes. &gt;&gt; If you came from God, &gt;&gt; you you he has carried to you. &gt;&gt; He's conveyed to you his nature, his character. &gt;&gt; And made us made it accessible to us. &gt;&gt; G. Have you ever had traits from your parents that you recognized and uh and then you you tried to control them? You tried to take mastery over them because you didn't really particularly like it when you saw it in your parents and you saw it as a child. You saw it as a young person. You saw it in your mother or dad. Saw them do certain things. You thought, you know, you know, I I And then you started getting up adult in your own life and found yourself doing the same thing. So, I'm going to I'm going to kind of master that. I'm going to squatchch it. I'm going to be like brother G Roald. Anyhow, I know what that's all about. You have that. I mean, little simple things. &gt;&gt; Little simple things. You'll just put your hand up to your face just exactly the way dad did it. You'll just do something and exactly the way your dad did it or your mother did it or somebody in your family did it. We inherit it. I'm glad that we have that because it helps to bring home the truth &gt;&gt; that if I got that through a human gene, I certainly got something worth having from the spiritual father. [Music] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here on a Wednesday night because there's a certain attraction to the word of God. God loves his word. &gt;&gt; You've gained that. &gt;&gt; He loves holiness. You love that. &gt;&gt; His presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is God. He's worshiped. &gt;&gt; We love that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I could enumerate a lot of things were one of his attributes to begin with. You come forth in the bedding ground of your mother. Your father didn't know you. You were in his loins. And when you come forth in the be in the bedding ground of mother, then you become a human being and are made in the image of your father. Now you can fellowship with him. And the same thing by God. If you've got eternal life, you are here because your name was placed on the lamb's book of life before there was even a foundation of the world. You're a gene, a spiritual gene out of your heavenly father, a part of God's word. That be so, as I've said, then you was with Jesus when he was here because he was the word, &gt;&gt; and you suffered with him, died with him, buried with him, and rose with him, and now sitting in heavenly places with him. They that were with me, &gt;&gt; they that followed me, &gt;&gt; they that were with me, &gt;&gt; shall have this reward. And whatever the reward is, we are we're I don't say we're we care not because brother Brandham says we don't put enough emphasis upon rewards, but we're not living here for reward. We're we are living here because we love him and we and and I sometimes think the world is so kooky that I wouldn't want to live like the world if there was no heaven. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Margaret. &gt;&gt; I feel happy about it, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everybody could have clapped at that one. &gt;&gt; Even if there was no heaven, it's still the best thing going. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. So now your name was in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. And when the lamb took the book, he didn't say anything. you don't find anything of him being spoken and uh I don't know if I can convey this to you but I will attempt to do so. I believe and this is my own personal belief but I believe that in the ministry of brother Brandham as as it was let me just step back in the ministry of John the Baptist his ministry bridged from the old testament into the new &gt;&gt; you follow that and in the old testament it was god above the people and now he bridged it to until he could say, "This is the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." So he bridged it from God above the people to God with the people. &gt;&gt; You follow me? &gt;&gt; And from from God the Father to God the Son. &gt;&gt; He bridged that. &gt;&gt; Please hear me close now. Brother Brandham's ministry bridged the manifestation of Jesus Christ from lamb to lion. &gt;&gt; The reason I say that is because he came and I'll say he came. But when Jesus came, and excuse me for going back and forth, but I need to in order to get the picture. When Jesus came, the Bible tells us that he went into the synagogue as was his custom &gt;&gt; and they they kept sacred the seventh day and he himself was the first day &gt;&gt; because he was the beginning. &gt;&gt; So he was actually spanning that period of time. John John the forerunner said this is the lamb. In other words, he's pointing forward. He's not saying something that he was prophecies from back here or whatever more. He's pointing forward. This is the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. They had no phrase like that. This was revolutionary. He's the lamb of God. What's the lamb of God? They knew a lamb dies, a lamb suffers, a lamb is the sacrifice. But here's a man and he's the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Still with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham's ministry now he's uh he he's he's also prophet, priest, and king. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is all of them. He's prophet when he was on earth. And he's priest. He took his own blood and entered on in the scripture says on our behalf with his own blood &gt;&gt; that the that the sin question was settled. Your sin question was settled. All right. And we've been sprinkled or washed by the blood of the lamb. Now, so he enters into the holy of holies. It says the scripture, he enters into the holy of holies with his own blood &gt;&gt; once. &gt;&gt; It was all finished. There not going to be another sacrifice like that. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, he enters in with his own blood. And for all of these centuries now, we have uh we have an era or a time of grace. And he's the lamb of God. The lamb of God. And uh and I'll say the religion has developed. And when brother Brennham came on the scene when he when his ministry broke on the scene is identical to Jesus Christ. When Jesus broke on the scene, he went to the synagogue as they did when brother Brandham's ministry broke on the scene. He broke he he came amongst the people and they were uh whatever it was that the the I should say the the churches or the last move of God or Pentecost and that he said it was the Pentecostal people that received him. &gt;&gt; Did he not say that? &gt;&gt; He said that because that was the last move of God. So he comes right with them and and they're speaking in tongues and manifesting all kinds of gifts and things like that. And it's just as though he just comes to with that first pull and just moves in that realm &gt;&gt; and they're just a, you know, they're not startled with the fact that he takes them by the hand. And I sat there as some of you young fellas, I sat there and watched as he took people by the hand and declared what their diseases were. And then they weren't startled when the second pull came and and he stood back and they stood there uh a few feet away and he began to reveal the secret of their heart. That didn't startle them. That was that was wonderful and they just wanted to have that and they wanted to see that and they wanted to stand there and they wanted their own heart to be revealed. But then when the when the book was opened &gt;&gt; and the lion had to cry, &gt;&gt; now it had a different kind of a voice. &gt;&gt; They didn't want to hear that &gt;&gt; because that wasn't just down in line with what they had taught all these centuries or all these years. It wasn't in line with that. It it that now now the creator was coming to correct things, &gt;&gt; correct the home, &gt;&gt; correct the church, correct our lives, correct our our our order, correct everything to put it in place. &gt;&gt; And that's where it become very very difficult and people struggled with it and chafed after it and chafed under it and all the rest of it and then they had to walk away from it and finally have to say nasty things and crucify that word. not realizing they think they're getting out of ministry and but actually when the word when it when when the sound cried out &gt;&gt; now this almighty God in the beginning God said let there be &gt;&gt; and there was &gt;&gt; are you are you listening &gt;&gt; and there was why was there because God was in the word &gt;&gt; God was in that word and In other words, the word was pregnantated &gt;&gt; with life, &gt;&gt; pregnantated with power, &gt;&gt; pregnantated with creative power. &gt;&gt; God was in his word. &gt;&gt; And thus the word can say, "And in the beginning was the word of God, and the word was God." &gt;&gt; It wasn't only God's voice, &gt;&gt; but the word was God. And now coming way to the end of time after the beginning of the creation, the new creation which Jesus Christ was that beginning. And then he prophesied that in the end he'll reveal himself again. And what does he do? He becomes word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now there he was the word. He was the word in the in the body of Jesus Christ. And God transmitted himself down. And the Bible says or I should say the prophet of God says that he materialized himself. He materialized himself &gt;&gt; in the body and he became Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You following me? &gt;&gt; Now in the end time he takes an adopted son. One that was born in sin shape and iniquity like you and I. &gt;&gt; But one that was called &gt;&gt; to become a messenger to be the messenger of the age. born a prophet. Couldn't help it. And I tell you friends, I listen to it. I just marvel. I just marvel that God would even send this kind of proof to us. It must We must have been uh believers of the unbelievers of the utmost kind in this generation because anything less than this probably would have convinced us. But we we God was determined. I am going to show them. I'm going to vindicate it. I'm going to prove it. I'm going to go over and over and over again. I won't do it once or twice. I'll do it for nights at a time. I'll do it all over the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So that this unbelieving nation, unbelieving uh world can come to judgment. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the same messenger takes it all the way from a first pull and a second pull when God is proving it into a third pull. And the third pull is a pull. It's a p u l a pull. &gt;&gt; And they wrote the song I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; When when when Jesus was walking, God was in him. God manifest in the flesh. He's walking along the shores of Galilee and he said to young men, "Come and follow me." I can tell you they felt the pull. &gt;&gt; They didn't feel a pull of a miracle or a sign in the hand. They didn't feel the pull because he revealed some secret to their heart. They felt the pull because just at his words, come and follow me. He didn't have to give them some great or uh you know uh oratory or some great speech or he didn't have to preach a sermon. He didn't have to convince them. He didn't have to try to force them. Just come &gt;&gt; follow me. And they felt the pull. &gt;&gt; Friends, &gt;&gt; it's for you if you've never felt that. &gt;&gt; I look around this room. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't live your life without feeling that pull. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love your voice. &gt;&gt; Let me hear your voice. &gt;&gt; And you say, "What is it pulling me to?" Not pulling you into the church. Not pulling you just so that you have a good a nice service. That's not the pull. The pull is so that they would be transformed from their old nature to their new nature so they could bring forth what he had ordained them to bring forth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham could not bring forth Isaac till his name was changed. And in the changing of the name, the change of a character &gt;&gt; and he became a different man. &gt;&gt; Peter had his name changed because in his old nature, he could wield a sword. But in his new nature, he could take the keys and open up the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Saul had to have a name change to match his new nature. Under Saul, he could take and throw people in prison. But under his new nature, he could take and give them the gospel. &gt;&gt; My brothers, my sisters, on this Wednesday evening, I'm not even I'm not even think I don't care how many are here. I preach like I preach to the world. &gt;&gt; This spoken word came with this kind of indication so that you could have the full affirmation. This word is cell upon self &gt;&gt; to change my spiritual being &gt;&gt; from the old nature to the new nature &gt;&gt; and in the new nature I don't even know fully what he wants me to do but you keep getting cell upon cell and you'll be built up into the man into the woman that God wants here on the earth &gt;&gt; and then you can say I was with him &gt;&gt; and he will say you that were with me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the regeneration because this is still creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why in the prophet's ministry, he had to have the proof. Let there be a squirrel. &gt;&gt; And it was there. &gt;&gt; It didn't jump off the tree. It was created. &gt;&gt; Because the third pull came to us in the demonstration of creation. &gt;&gt; I am the amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the first and the last. &gt;&gt; I am the true and faithful and true witness, &gt;&gt; the beginning of the creation of the beginning of the creation of God. Tell my last messenger &gt;&gt; that's who I am &gt;&gt; because it would be his portion of his ministry to demonstrate because you have to be created. &gt;&gt; When we say we got to be changed, &gt;&gt; you'll be changed. You'll go under a regeneration. &gt;&gt; You'll be recreated &gt;&gt; from a dying person to a living person. &gt;&gt; From mortal to immortality, &gt;&gt; from corruption to incorruption. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, we need a renovation. &gt;&gt; Complete renovation &gt;&gt; from the old man that we were born. &gt;&gt; Yes, you got cells and they're dying. &gt;&gt; Yes, you got a nature by a gene and it's got to be changed. Hallelujah. I'm not interested in the old human nature. I'm not interested in the old human gene. We need to have the gene of God. &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh God, let the Holy Spirit come to that gene, that spiritual gene that came from my heavenly parent." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many people have I got here could say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Let the spiritual gene, let the Holy Ghost come upon that spiritual gene. Hallelujah. manifest that life. &gt;&gt; Manifest this eternal life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're going to do tonight, but I'm going to have my own revival up here. &gt;&gt; That old nature, I hate it. &gt;&gt; Gets us in trouble. We're not interested in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thought much upon this prophecy and I just related the prophecy God gave that he'll put enmity between the woman, between the serpent, between thee, talking to the serpent and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed, and she shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. And as a result of that, we all came the by the same way. &gt;&gt; Might have been in a nice hospital, might might have been at home, might have been in a barn or wherever it was. It was a mess of birth. We all came the same way. &gt;&gt; And that which came by the woman dies. &gt;&gt; We didn't only come by the woman, but we came by the word. Who is the man? &gt;&gt; The man Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And by the man, we live. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And he reversed things. &gt;&gt; Yes. And of any age ever needed to be reversed, it's this one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a woman's world. &gt;&gt; Sisters, I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about the whole spirit of the age. &gt;&gt; Whole thing is just manned and manipulated by women. And and it it's it's Satan's Eden. Once again, &gt;&gt; we don't need to say a whole lot about that. Now in Hebrews it says, "For it became him for whom all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make them the captain to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. And again I will put my trust in him. And again behold I and the children which God hath given me. And out of the bosom of the father, God came the out of the bosom of the father, God came the son. And the very gene of the father, I'm wanting to bring this again to you. All the genes of the father, the life of the father was in the son. Amen. &gt;&gt; My wife's dad was in the first world war and he was in a very very difficult his his brother also was in the war and he was at Vimemy Ridge and you've no doubt all heard about Vimemy Ridge and Lord willing sister Biscll and I will be in Belgium in the first part of December and Brother Nathaniel Iverson's brother David said that we can take you to a number of places and one of them is Flanders Fields and uh one is Vim Ridge and different places that have a lot of significance. Uh my father-in-law told me one one on one occasion that uh he had a buddy and his buddy just became very very he he became very I won't say despondent but he became very kind of depressed just like in a day or so something like that just came on him and he was saying he was saying to the his buddies and to my father-in-law I just feel like I'm I'm going to get it. I feel like I'm going to be killed. I feel like I'm going to be killed. He just kept saying that and they went into the trenches and he took a bullet right in the head and he was gone. And my father-in-law, he could have been he could have been there, but it was impossible &gt;&gt; because my wife was still in him. &gt;&gt; That's that's the end of the subject. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If somebody had to come in this life to represent something of the heavenly father, &gt;&gt; you can be right on you can you can have an atomic bomb fall and it won't do a thing. &gt;&gt; It just be a fizzle. &gt;&gt; I I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; And I've talked to a lot of people that have been right in the middle of the shells and the bombs falling and the artillery and everything else. And even the spirit that was in them, they had no fear &gt;&gt; because something was telling them that nothing can touch them. &gt;&gt; Who's that? Uh, one of the Bosnian brothers, the old man. What's his name? Brother Milco. &gt;&gt; The old brother. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. Neto. Brother Nato. He was driving a fuel truck in the midst of this war in Bosnia. He was driving a fuel truck. And he said the bullets were flying every direction. He is driving the truck. He didn't have a bit of fear. &gt;&gt; Well, he hadn't come to the knowledge of the message yet. I think that that's what had to happen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I I I would have had a few second thoughts driving a fuel truck &gt;&gt; while all that artillery and shelling is going on. Let's face it, we're all human. &gt;&gt; Behold, I and the children you've given me. He couldn't say, "Behold, I Excuse me, father. There's three or four that are missing." &gt;&gt; He couldn't say that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to be there. &gt;&gt; You're going to be there. &gt;&gt; That to me is a wonderful confidence. &gt;&gt; And he says, "You're here because your name was placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a foundation of the world. And you're a gene, a spiritual gene out of your heavenly father. Now that book I haven't got time this evening but that book carried or was the story of the account of your spiritual jane. Brother Brandham said when you're reading the church ages, it will sound like there's two books, &gt;&gt; but it's really only one, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the one is the book of your natural life. &gt;&gt; And it kind of flows out like wheat that would be growing. The life continues on. The stock of the wheat has no resemblance to the blade. The green blade is not the same color. It's not the same shape. is not nothing the same, &gt;&gt; but it's the same life &gt;&gt; that came right from the seed that was in the ground till you have seed up at the head &gt;&gt; in the fall time at the harvest time. You It's gone back to wheat again. And that's brother Brennham makes that statement. Those you I'm speaking to people I expect knows the message. He said it's back to wheat again. &gt;&gt; It's harvest time again. It's already arrived. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say if you're a gene, a spiritual gene out of your heavenly father, a part of God's word, that's what it is, a part of God's word. And that be so. He said, as I've said, then you was with Jesus when he was here on earth, etc. So God, now I'm breaking in just a little bit different. G, give me a few more minutes. Now I'm reaching on beyond that. God thought of himself as being human in that great mind of God who created heavens and galaxies and universes. This God he thought of himself of being human and in the future home. He says now in the beginning was the word. Catch it. Don't ever tire that phrase. In the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. He said the three stages. It was an attribute. It was an attribute first was in God &gt;&gt; that he thought himself as being human and that transmitted him down &gt;&gt; to be Jesus. &gt;&gt; The thought transmitted him down to be Jesus. And so thus Jesus possessed all the qualities of character of God because he was the gene of his father or the son of God. And all those seeds were resting in God's great providence in the rising of the sun. I quoted this Sunday. Then he said, "When he came forth on that morning, because I live, you live also." Not only was he the beneficiary of the resurrection, not only did he rise, but he says, "But all those seed that was resting in God's great providence was a benefactor of that resurrection life because he said, "Because I live, you shall live also." &gt;&gt; That was the breaking of the seal because he was brought up. This is the breaking of the Easter seal on it was the secret. Yes, &gt;&gt; it was their life be beyond death. &gt;&gt; No one had had no one had come forth like this and proved &gt;&gt; that he could raise himself up again and prove that he could live and eat as he did before he did. And he this is not a spirit. Have you any meat, brethren? Here's a fish and some honeycomb. And he ate it and vanished from the place. What a body. &gt;&gt; Because I live, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; Amen. You that have been with me, &gt;&gt; you that have been with me &gt;&gt; in this regeneration, in this part of the regeneration, &gt;&gt; this is what is promised to us. &gt;&gt; And we must declare it in life and declare it. &gt;&gt; If God was taking us off the face of the earth, this should be something that we should be able to not only just hang on to, but also to declare. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because I live, you shall live also. And because he was brought up, so will everyone that's in Christ be brought up with him. &gt;&gt; I say thank you, Father, &gt;&gt; that you sent Elijah to say that &gt;&gt; everyone when he came up, everyone that was in him. So now it puts us to a test. Do you believe you were in him? &gt;&gt; Everyone that was in him have to come up with him. &gt;&gt; If you're in the grave with him, you have to come out of the grave with him. Hallelujah. Of which baptism is just a signal signifies it. But if you were in the grave, you've got to come out of the grave. &gt;&gt; And if he ascended, you have to ascend. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have to ascend. &gt;&gt; And if he ascended to the right hand of the majesty of God, you'll be there with him because you were in him in the first place. There's no place &gt;&gt; where somehow we dissipate or we disappear or somehow uh we're lost in the process. We're not lost in the process. &gt;&gt; Nobody's lost in the process. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say glory to God in the face of every doubting devil. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He won't lose a one. And that's why I can say I and the children. &gt;&gt; Behold, I am the children. &gt;&gt; I've lost none of them. &gt;&gt; I came forth from you a gene of your own nature. A cell of the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you gave me a body and a life to live. And I lived a life. And I have those that were with me and still with me. &gt;&gt; There were some that were with me back then. And there's some that are with me in the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; A lot of people want to ride along and be have have the benefits of of the healing and of the you know all the nice things while he was the lamb of God all this time 2,000 years as the lamb of God. But at the end time comes one and he comes to the synagogue or he comes to the churches as was his custom. Yes, &gt;&gt; he always did that. Sang the songs that they were accustomed to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But then Revelation 10 had to be fulfilled &gt;&gt; and he was part of that. &gt;&gt; And then that book, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that book had to be opened. &gt;&gt; And in the book was names or natures of life &gt;&gt; of those that were struggling on earth who couldn't live it. &gt;&gt; And now the lamb is going to call them forth. And I say to this congregation, I say to all who will ever hear this message or hear this service, have you heard the lamb call? &gt;&gt; Not a preacher called, the lamb call. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You've probably heard the ad. You know, you someone comes knocking on the door and they tell you who's calling. Amway calling. This isn't Amway. This is the living way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the lamb calling. &gt;&gt; Hello. This is the lamb calling. &gt;&gt; Oh, I've been waiting to hear your voice. &gt;&gt; What can you tell me, oh lamb of God? I can tell you your old nature is gone in my blood. &gt;&gt; And your new nature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm giving you a new nature. Peter, you couldn't open the keys to the kingdom until the very spirit is in me came in you and changed your nature. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul, you couldn't write the New Testament until your nature was changed. And so your nature has to your name has to be changed from Saul to Paul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Abraham, Abram to Abraham, &gt;&gt; Sarai to Sarah. &gt;&gt; Glory. And he inserted some of his own life. And that was in the Old Testament. And I asked the Jewish rabbi, not Rabbi Richmond, but one here in town. I said, "Is there any significance to H, Abram's name being changed from Abraham, Abram to Abraham?" Oh, he said, "Very much so." He said, "You see, H in our alphabet is stands for divinity. It's associated with divinity." &gt;&gt; And so that was what was inserted in Abram's name. &gt;&gt; Divinity. divine &gt;&gt; nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something that could bring forth Isaac. &gt;&gt; Abram couldn't bring forth Isaac. You and I can't bring forth Jesus Christ. Tell this nature without the book being open. &gt;&gt; Oh, are you with me, friends? &gt;&gt; That's why Pentecost was doing its best. And you can preach as hard as you want. You can preach what the people shouldn't do. That won't do it. You got to call their name forth out of the book. You got to say here you are children. &gt;&gt; The whole na the whole nature of God is presented to you. &gt;&gt; How is it presented? Word by word, cell by cell. And my brother, my sister, you that are here in this service, you maybe don't know what you don't realize what is happening service by service, but you are or or you hear a tape or a message, but you're hearing cell upon cell upon cell. And I tell you, I declare in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that's thus sayith the Lord, that word will change you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; He says, "If you're a son of God and I'm a son of God, we were a daughter. You're a daughter of God. You're in God at the beginning." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came became the fullness of the of the word, then we were in him &gt;&gt; in germ form. Germ form. When he was crucified, we was crucified in his body. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he rose from the dead, we rose with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I've heard that before, brother Ed. You said it last Sunday." You said, "I tell you what, as long as we're alive, we want to be saying the same thing." &gt;&gt; You want to tell the devil that every &gt;&gt; day, &gt;&gt; I'm in him who defeated you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Here's what they say scientifically. The cell is the functional basic unit of life. The cell, the C l is the functional basic unit of life. It is the smallest unit of life that is classified as a living thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the smallest unit of life, the smallest thing that could be imagined is a a cell is the smallest thing that could be classified as a living thing and is often called the building block of life. &gt;&gt; And you have somewhere between 10 and 100 trillion trillion cells. Now, the real you. I'm going to close in just a few moments. The real you and where you live. You had a You talk about a prophet. I mean, friends, God in that messenger could just go through all of those cells. Now, I'm down to one cell &gt;&gt; and I still can't find you. Because the cell is not you. &gt;&gt; The cells make you up this body. &gt;&gt; But the the you are the life of that cell. [Music] &gt;&gt; And the messenger is saying now I've got down to one teeny cell &gt;&gt; and I can't find you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glad you couldn't find me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says if you notice the subconscious is where you live. &gt;&gt; He says that's where you yourself live in perfect faith. He said his spirit is here &gt;&gt; and he knows you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He knows what science can never find. &gt;&gt; He knows you and you've got one thing to do and that's to believe it, &gt;&gt; to accept it. Yes, &gt;&gt; he knows you. Believe that. He knows what's in you. &gt;&gt; He knows what you are. &gt;&gt; He knows what your desire is. &gt;&gt; And he knows what you have need of. &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? &gt;&gt; He knows what what's in you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows what you are &gt;&gt; and he knows what your desire is &gt;&gt; and he knows what you have need of. &gt;&gt; The real you. &gt;&gt; He said in things that are to be this old earthly tabernacle. You know what it is? This body is like an old coat that you wear. A coat that you once wore wear, but now you have one so much better. you don't use it anymore. &gt;&gt; You know, my wife, she one day she says, "I need a new coat." I said, "Yeah, okay." And it was just the right time. I said, "Okay, we'll go into town. We'll drive into Vancouver and shop for a coat." So I just hit the go button, play button on the tape machine and it just started out like this. He said, "This body is like an old coat and you wear and the coat that you once wear and now you've got one so much better you don't use it anymore. What do you do?" He says, "You hang it up in the closet for you've got a better one." My wife took that as a confirmation. &gt;&gt; He says, "You are the inside of that. &gt;&gt; Remember that the garment only bore your image, &gt;&gt; but you don't need it anymore now. &gt;&gt; You hung it up. &gt;&gt; It's a rag." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's the way this old body is. It's bore the image of the heavenly. Yet it's not you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's not you. You are on the inside of that body. &gt;&gt; You, the spirit of God is on the inside of that body. He said you. And then he said the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; You're in on the inside of that body. And what makes the outside come into subjections? Because the inside is pulling it, &gt;&gt; bringing it in line with the word of God. &gt;&gt; You're inside you, yourself, your being. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, no science can ever find you. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon says quite frankly, you've never seen me &gt;&gt; and I've never seen you. &gt;&gt; All we see is the old coat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this body is just an old coat. And someday what you will do with it, someday it will hang in the earth's hall of memory of you. &gt;&gt; And you'll put it out yonder in the grave and somebody will put a tombstone up. Here lies Reverend so and so or John so and so at so and so. He says it'll lie there as a memorial of you. just a memorial of you. &gt;&gt; The people just seeing you in this and what you was your real you was on the inside of that. &gt;&gt; You know that is so ultimately profoundly simple and yet it's so true because your your whole being answers to it just saying amen. &gt;&gt; And then he talks about your body, spirit and soul. He says, "Now the outside body is the five inlets, your earthly home that you taste, feel and smell and see and so on. The inside which is spirit, five senses, but he says but the inside of that the soul has one thing." &gt;&gt; Now he's talking to believers. I want to say this to this congregation. That's where you live. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not a sermon. &gt;&gt; That's a statement. &gt;&gt; That's where you live. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; That's where we live. &gt;&gt; I claim that. &gt;&gt; And you and I need that. &gt;&gt; We need it. If you're going to get through this life, &gt;&gt; you sit in my chair sometime, you you wouldn't be so surprised why I hang on to this prophet's words like that because I've seen people go after education. I go after business, go after this or go after that and on down the road, the world and Satan takes his toll &gt;&gt; on it. It's just unbelievable. Just takes his toll on that. That's not what this life is all about. &gt;&gt; You got one channel. It's down that soul. And God sent Elijah to point right to it and tell you that's where you live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And every word." Now listen, this is not just a quote. That's where you live. And now when the word became flesh, it says, "And every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form. And if received, if received." Hello. &gt;&gt; If received, do you receive it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me hear all the young people say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me hear them say it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you receive it, let's hear everyone say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I receive it. &gt;&gt; I receive it. And if it's received, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's received, laid in seed form and spoke by the same thought, he said that materialize the Bible or brings things to pass. &gt;&gt; He said, and it he said an unveiling of God. Uh it's it's Elohim. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it was Elohim, the eternal, but in him was thoughts and he wanted to become material. And what did he do? Then he spoke the word &gt;&gt; and the word was materialized. And that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation. There's nothing wrong. It's Elohim materializing. And I say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; almighty God, &gt;&gt; we've got a group of believers here tonight. More than two or three, materialize amongst us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In whatever fashion you desire to be, materialize. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let him hear. Let us hear him call our name. &gt;&gt; The books opened. &gt;&gt; Hear the lamb calling. &gt;&gt; The words that we hear, the message we hear is the lamb calling. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just some words on a tape or in a book, &gt;&gt; but as you read it, then the Holy Spirit comes &gt;&gt; and you hear the lamb calling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You hear the great cry of the lion and he crying judgment and yet it's mercy. It's such a such an incredible time that you and I are living in. But God sent every one of us here. God sent that word to us in this generation. You're here. &gt;&gt; You're even a witness to it. You're sitting here in this service. You're here. You're part of this generation. I want to hear him say, "You that were with me, [Music] &gt;&gt; this is what I'm going to give you." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to close and I'll just leave you with this thought as I thought it was very significant. You know, the the people, they heard God say, "And God said, and there was." And God said, "And there was." And God said, "Go up in the mountain and don't let anyone come near." And God spoke and they saw the mountain on fire and the horror of darkness come down and and the people became afrighted. And I want to say to you in this congregation, if God came, God could come so near that you that you would literally believe your next breath would take you out of this world. &gt;&gt; I can tell you that. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in that presence, they said sometime they asked him, "Why don't you ask his name?" He said, "When you're in that presence, you don't say anything." I just heard I just read he was saying and he's talking to somebody and he's saying this trembling this trembling this shaking. He wasn't talking about them. I had to read on to find out he's talking about himself. &gt;&gt; He was trembling and and quivering and shaking in the presence of that one that was there becoming weak speaking to them. Tell you friends, it's an incredible presence. this quad, &gt;&gt; you're going to be in his divine presence. &gt;&gt; And we need to shed these old coats for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when they saw this kind of God, he said, and it was, "Let there be and there was." They feared that. So they went to Moses and they said, "Ask him not to speak to us. Let him speak to you and you come and tell us what he said. And brother Bram said from that time. Now please catch just catch it as I close. The people saw it. Let there be and there was. Let there be and there was. Let there be. I tell you, you'd be impressed if God just took you up and allowed you to see and and know that the thought of the almighty divine one was going out from his being and you saw galaxies and stars &gt;&gt; being birthed and the explosions in space and all these things. Even when we get the pictures, we are impressed. &gt;&gt; When we see the pictures, we're in awe. And that God would say to you, I'm calling you my son. I'm calling you my daughter. &gt;&gt; I'm calling you as part of my family. &gt;&gt; Then they said to Moses, tell him not to not to speak to us anymore. You speak. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram says from that time then he only spoke to the people through a prophet. &gt;&gt; Let that be absorbed into your system tonight. I would be impressed in the presence of the almighty God. That God came and spoke through a man from that time on. And that is why in this generation we went for all those hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years. And there were times in the Old Testament, God let them go for several hundred years without a prophet. But then when the prophet began to come on the scene, he'd say, "Let there be." And there was. because it wasn't the man speaking, it was God speaking. &gt;&gt; And friends, I don't think that we some may think I put too much emphasis on what this messenger said. I quite frankly, I don't think we can put enough on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If that thought would even be in your mind, go home and before you go to bed, just listen to a prayerline tape. And when he speaks to one after the other, incidentally, that's not just going back to a first or second poll. That happens to be going back to the vindication. That's God vindicating. I'm vindicating. I'm proving I'm proving who this is. This is the proof. You're hearing the proof. &gt;&gt; When you hear it and when you're done with that, then you just say, "God sent him to tell me God sent him sent this mouth to call to speak a word that will bring forth and actually create the kind of nature, the kind of character speaking out from him is coming. The very cells of God coming out of this messenger is coming the cells that have the unit of hereditary with it. You mean I can actually hear this and receive right divine nature from almighty God? That's exactly right. It's man that spoke this. &gt;&gt; Man spoke it, but it was God speaking. &gt;&gt; Man was the tool. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's what sets this church or the believers apart from everything else. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have it available to you. &gt;&gt; It is absolutely yours. &gt;&gt; And that's what God thinks of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads in prayer. Father, we are indeed thankful. I'm so humbled. So humbled even to stand before this group of people tonight, Lord, and be allowed to declare things that are so staggering and so from a worldly position, unbelievable, but we have been made to believe. We're conquerors in Christ Jesus. Oh, we thank you, Father, for your eternal word that is forever settled in heaven. and we just want to bless your name tonight. Thank you that you have made us participants. You've made this available to us. And not only that, Lord, but we are able to be here tonight to partake &gt;&gt; to eat of the body word of the Lord Jesus Christ. And we want to bless your name and give you praise and thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name. I'd like everyone to stand if you would while we still continue to pray. And perhaps there may be some that you just want to be identified and say, "Father, I want to lift my hands to you. And I'm asking that you'll cause my soul to be able to grasp and to just revel in what you have, what you are speaking. Father, &gt;&gt; speak to my soul. Let me hear you, oh lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Call forth this nature. &gt;&gt; Some of you that may be struggling with some weakness in your old nature, that old nature won't become stronger. Let it go. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh God, bring me, I pray, &gt;&gt; that I I covet and look after and hunger after, oh God, the divine nature &gt;&gt; and cause me to feast on the promises of God, &gt;&gt; transforming power &gt;&gt; into this vessel, &gt;&gt; oh God, I'll hang the old coat up, &gt;&gt; this only bearing the image, but let the new man, the inner man, &gt;&gt; grow in the strength." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How we thank you Lord Jesus. Your name we ask it. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that. We bless your name. We bless your name. We do that. [Music] We bless your name. I give you honor. If you praise, you are the truth. [Music] I bless your name. I bless your name. Let's just take a moment to praise his name again. [Music] I your name. I give you [Music] honor. You are [Music] the truth. I your name. I [Music] worship. [Music] [Music] Great. [Music] I Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. the way [Music] I [Music] second verse says something about midnight. Well, how many here have trouble sleeping? Who wakes up at night and worries? Is that incredible? I do. I put up both hands and you can quote all the scripture you want but you just have trouble sleeping and small things become large and I keep telling myself laying here worrying about it won't make it any better just go to sleep you lay down doesn't work doesn't always work sometimes it works some midnight hour if you should find I sing this with all my heart because I have found that and yet the very things I can't preach anything different because what we're preaching is the truth of God's word and I just say that that nature of God I've got another I've got another gene and I want to focus on that nature of God of the new life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some midnight hour. &gt;&gt; And [Music] if I find you're in a prison, in a prison in your mind. And they and they will fall. They will fall in the name. I praise. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] I bless your name. &gt;&gt; What do you think it did for people when he when he said, "Brother Pen would say, would it help you if I told you your name?" It helped him a whole lot. Just your earthly name because it put a connection. God knows who I am. &gt;&gt; God knows where I live. He knows exactly all about us. He knows the most minute thing. &gt;&gt; He knows all about your home, your family. He knows all about the finances. He knows all about all of these things. Does he care? &gt;&gt; I want to say, oh yes, he cares. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus cares. &gt;&gt; He knows all about it. And not only does he know about it, but if we could just grasp and exercise the faith, he will do the unexpected and do much more than we even thought he could do. I want to close this service with that cuz you may need a something in your life. You may need something a miracle of some kind or you may know someone that needs it and we want to hold out to him for that. I bless your name. Let's give him praise and glory now. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's praise him together. [Music] &gt;&gt; Give you honor. Give you praise. Give you praise. The truth. [Music] Our loving Lord Jesus, I'm inviting your children, inviting these people, inviting others that may be in other places or other parts of the world, inviting them to now just take that measure of faith that you have given to them and to reach out, oh God, to you at this time, Father, for everyone that is here. Some with hands raised, with hearts raised, with needs bringing them up before you, oh God. And they know, they know with assurityity that yes, you do not only know, but you care. And you're prepared even now to reach down, oh God. Transform and bring change, oh God, where there needs to be brought change. I pray father in the name of Jesus Christ. You'll bring the curse upon the enemy. You suffered the curse at Calvary. Now let the enemy suffer his own curse in the name of Jesus Christ. Break those feathers. We defy them in the name the holy victorious righteous name of Jesus Christ. Oh yes, Jesus. Jesus. Glory to your name. Almighty one, mighty overcomer. Oh God, you're the conqueror. You raised even death couldn't hold you. Corruption couldn't set in. Oh father, now I pray for this congregation. We're in a corrupt generation. We're in a world that is sinking. Father in its darkness, in its terrible confusion, and in its sin. Oh, thank you, Father, that we can live above it. &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll put such a strength within. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Every person that is here, &gt;&gt; every young person, every young man or woman, Lord, mothers and fathers, put something within us, I pray, a strength, oh God, and let us return, Father, on the Lord's day &gt;&gt; with victories. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Victory is in our testimony. &gt;&gt; We thank you for it, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know who has tomorrow, but I know he holds it. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Going to dismiss you in Jesus Christ's name. Maybe we could just sing that little chorus. Many things about tomorrow I don't seem to understand. I like saying it quite often because none of us know about tomorrow. We're going to be in Murphy'sboro this coming weekend. Will you pray for us? &gt;&gt; They're hearing from many, many places and brother Adam Moora is coming down and we're happy about that. Brother Milco, so they'll be able to tell about different places. Brother Murphy will be there as well and brother Tom and Joanne will return on on Friday. So you'll have a wonderful weekend. It's going to be baptismal. There's going to be four now baptized down in Seattle on Friday night. So anyone if you're able to go down, you wish to go down, be part of the service. Brother John is going down, can take the service down there and do the baptisms. So pray for us. Will you do that? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, let's just sing it. Then we're going to be dismissed. I don't see [Music] what I know. Yes, I know. And I know my hand. We praise you for Jesus. We praise you for Jesus. I know. Yes, I know. And I know my And I know he know. once more.

[Music]
