[snorts] &gt;&gt; Just looking around the building this morning, Lord, and &gt;&gt; just wanting to pray for the youngest to the oldest. Lord, I [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just love your people, Lord Jesus. You see the elderly hobbling into the house of God. Lord, we pray for the elders of our church.

Brother Ryan's going to sing a special for us this evening just before we turn the service to our pastor. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. He's faithful and he's true. All of those songs meant something, each one of them, to me this morning. And I thought, you know, what else can we say? He's faithful. &gt;&gt; He's true. Bless you, saints. I've just been uh pondering and rejoicing within my own heart of what it means to be right with God. And this song just began to go through my mind. And so I trust that you would rejoice. is called, "Oh, to be right with God." And it's not necessarily that we're not and that we're longing. It's just exclaiming, "Oh, to be right with God and what it means to be under the blood and to have fellowship with him and to not come to him always in repentance, trying to make something right, but actually moving on in fellowship and communion with God." And I find sometimes the enemy doesn't even have to get something between us and God. He just has to convince us that there is something. And I just say, "Put it under the blood. And if it's under the blood, move on and rejoice in what it means to be right with God. And so I hope it's a blessing to you. [music] [music] Oh, to be right with [music] God. Oh, to be right [music] with God. Blood washed and clean with [music] nothing between all [singing] to be right [music] with God. I found [singing] a place [music] here in his grace. [music] Sheltered away [singing] from [music] sin. here in his love communing [music] as one with this blessed assurance [music] within. [music] Oh to be right with [music] God. Oh, to [music] be right with God. Blood washed [music] and clean with nothing between. [music] Oh, [singing] to be right with [music] God. Oh, what [music and singing] arrest when wrongs are confessed and [music] left in the sea [singing] of God's [music] forgetfulness. Sweet [music] mercy is mine [singing] and freedom sublime [music] as in Jesus I'm forgiven and blessed [music] and oh [music] to be right with God. [music] [singing] Oh, to be [music] right [singing] with God. Oh, blood [singing] washed and [music] clean with nothing between [music] all [singing] to be right with God. [singing and music] Oh, walking communing with Jesus my [music] Lord. [singing] He tenderly [music] leads me each day. Oh, and [music] nothing [singing] is sweeter, no treasure more [music and singing] dear than dwelling each moment [music and singing] with his presence near. [singing] Oh, [music] to be right with God. [singing] Oh, to be right with [music] God. Oh, to [music] be right with God. Oh, blood [music] washed and clean with [singing] nothing between.

[singing] Oh, [music] to be right with God. [music] [music] [applause] as the deer penth for the water. As we invite our pastor to come [music] this morning as the Sunday school children make their way in and find their [music] seats, find their families, their parents, the [music] new generation walking down the aisles. They raise right up amongst us. [music] Amen. As the [singing] deer [music] panteth for the water, so [singing] my soul longeth [music] after [singing] thee. You [music and singing] alone are my heart's desire and I long [music] to worship thee. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You [singing] alone are [music] my strength, my shield. To you [music and singing] alone does my spirit [music] yield. [singing] You alone [music] are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. [music] For you're my [music] friend and you [singing] are my brother even though [music] you are [singing] a king. Yes, I want [music and singing] you more than any other. So much more than [music and singing] anything. [music] For you alone [singing] are my strength, my shield. [music] To you alone [singing] does my spirit yield. [music and singing] You alone are my heart desire [music and singing] and I long to worship thee. [music] I want you. I [singing] want you more than gold or silver only you can satisfy. [music and singing] [music] You alone [singing] are the real joy [music] giver and the [singing] apple of my eyes [music] for [singing] you. You alone are my strength. [music] You're my shield. To you [singing] alone does my [music] You alone [singing] [music] are my heart and [music] my to worship me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Do you enjoy your salvation? &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to be out there in the world. The world hasn't got much to offer, do they? &gt;&gt; Don't have anything to offer. &gt;&gt; That's the longer you live, the more you realize that the longer the world goes on, the less it has. &gt;&gt; And the longer the world goes on, the longer we go on, the more we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to thank all of those that have been coming out faithfully this last week and and uh concluding the work at the at the school building. Uh we call it the school building. We actually want to use the the gym I call it gym auditorium. We're hoping to be able to use it at the uh and we will by God's grace uh at the anniversary meetings. So, we're looking forward to that and we're very very near winding it up. We I want to thank you. It was an excellent show show up this uh showing rather this week of the workers and just any time that you can in this coming week or two and we'll be all finished. Uh I want to just say in reference to the uh service this morning before we before we stand and read the scripture I have been uh coincidentally Wednesday's service we didn't archive it. If you weren't here Wednesday's service and you wish to get it you'll have to see uh brother Aaron or sister Debbie in the office because we didn't archive it. But I felt it was very very [clears throat] personal just to our congregation and uh but we have already uh provided it to some who wanted to hear it and uh so it was it's kind of a downhome you know a lot of personal things and just testimony and uh but I wanted to be kind of an introduction for today's service as well. [clears throat] Well, they just brought brother Edwin Dods in. Hallelujah. Brother Edwin Dods. [applause] [applause] I don't know. I thought he was in a holding pattern, but Brother Edwin's just having another birthday. Hallelujah. God bless you, brother Edwin. &gt;&gt; One stalwart soldier. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Prayed for you this morning, too, while we were praying for the different saints. And some of you are sitting here. You don't maybe not aware of it, but you come on my mind while we're praying. So, we just start praying for you. I don't know why God puts you on my mind or on our heart and God put me on your heart and you mentioned my name. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I appreciate that. And if he hasn't, maybe he will later on today. Amen. We can't get enough or too much. But what I've been uh uh approaching in the scripture and I've been listening to the messages and been speaking to my own wife because uh I just feel as though that there is more in the word of God than than perhaps we are obtaining. So I want to find that key uh just to obtain what we have need of. We one thing is certain we have needs and a second thing that's certain we have the Jehovah Gyra &gt;&gt; who provides all those needs and so all we have to do is just find that place to connect them. You might say well is that such a difficulty? Well, yeah, it's a difficulty because we have uh we have un unanswered prayers. Uh not that God is we can't dictate to him. It might not be today, might be tomorrow, might be next week, but we want to have a perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there's a rest in the perfect faith. We don't need a big support group from the world. We don't need all kinds of psychology. We don't need all kinds of additives. Uh we don't need anything. I believe we just need God's word. And if we can lay hold of that, you believe we have it. &gt;&gt; I believe we do. I really do. And I see others in the scripture uh not only in the scripture but I've experienced also in my own life where it just seems that you find a place in and uh if God is pleased with something or someone and I always try to find discover what is it. Um, for those of you that had an opportunity to see the meetings from Switzerland and I had the Larga family up, and I mentioned this probably uh in a last meeting or two, but now Sunday morning, I'd like to mention it again. And uh, Brother Larga passed away when he was 46. I believe there's eight children. And the youngest one was just a months old. It was about a year old. a baby in arms and then they went from there on up into their teens and she was a very very young widow. She ended up in her uh either late 30s or early 40s with all that family. Uh he was a teacher so they have no social network in that country in Croatia at that time and uh she's left alone with his children. I know brother Milco and we and I we spoke a good deal from time to time and I know that he did everything he could to assist them. We did everything we could to be a spiritual support to them. We also sent some offering to help her, but I knew it wasn't near enough. And I just wondered how in the world is this woman ever going to, you know, survive with this family? And as soon as these children are old enough, they're probably going to, you know, just disappear and go their own way. And to see them all these years later, the young men, all of them about 6'3 a piece, big broad shouldered guys. Jonathan, when his father went to the grave, it's just like Jonathan stepped right into his mold. Looks like him. His father was translator. Jonathan just continued translating. His father distributed the message books and got them out every way possible. I mean, he could invent ways to get them out. And Jonathan just started doing the same thing. It was like one left and the other one just came in with was much younger and and full of ideas and full and never stopped. Never stopped. just just one focus in mind as a kingdom of God get this message. This message is God's word to this generation. And then and then up come his brothers and they just come in right behind him and started looking like a team. And here's the sisters and his sisters and they all stand there. I had them come up on the platform. You want to see them? But now I want to tell you why I had them come up on the platform. And the people there didn't know and most of them still don't know except perhaps some from Switzerland may be streaming this service. It's nighttime there and this is their evening service. But I wanted [clears throat] it. It was partly for myself and partly for this congregation. I want you to be able to have a a just look at this family. When I look at a family like that and I know that humanly it isn't it isn't any human intelligence that that mother was able to raise that family. She's more like one of them rather than, you know, she's not one that would be rigid, I suppose, or overbearing or overpowering or anything of that nature. And when I see that, now I'm just telling you something very personal. When I see something like that, I I I want to look at it. I want to observe it. And in deep in my heart of hearts, I say either this woman or the father who passed away has did something that God smiled on and just simply said, "I'm going to bless this family. I'm just going to bless them." That's it. Finished. When God said, you might question that, but when God said to Abraham, I'm going to bless you and I'm going to bless those that bless you. And there's no changing that, that's an irrevocable statement. And you know then then I try to observe because I want to pick up even if it's by the process of osmosis I want to pick up what characteristic what is it that God was so pleased with and you can't you you can't tell me nobody here or nobody in the world could ever convince me that somehow there was something that God observed something that God loved. And just to see that entire family standing there, about 10 11 of them now. And uh I just uh uh it was a blessing to me. A real blessing to me. What is there in an an individual? And I I'm speaking to everybody. It's not beyond you. You want to ask the same question. What is it, Father, that you'd have me to do? What can I do? How how do you want me to respond? How do you want me to react? And so I'm going to be going into uh approach, going to be going into attitude, we're going to go into things that I think influence and uh uh because there are simp simple things and they're within everybody's reach and they're things which people received. They received physical things from God. And quite frankly, I want to announce to you, I'm interested in that. &gt;&gt; I'm interested in a supernatural God coming down amongst us and doing supernatural things. &gt;&gt; And no one can convince me we don't need that. And as time goes on, we need that more and more and more all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's stand as we read, please. We'll not be using any slides today, so you won't have to worry about that. I'm going to read out of Hebrews the 4th chapter once again, which we did last week as well. And uh [clears throat] I'll start at the 12th verse to just shorten our time a wee bit. And before we read, let us pray together. I'd like you to pray. You just ask God, "Father, make your word to be special to me today. Heavenly Father, uh I bow with this group of people, this audience of people that are here gathered and were so desirous. I enjoyed hearing the prayer that Brother Dave Ternoff prayed. Lord, how he expressed a love for the people. And I I recall just reading this week, Lord, how your prophet stood up and brother Jo uh Joseph Matson Boz had just spoke to his people and expressed his love to the people because of what they meant to him, Father. And I pray, Lord, you'll cause it to be and let it be a reality to these people. how I have such a personal love for them and for the many that are not present in this building, but they're elsewhere and they're in far away lands. And how we love the bride of Jesus Christ. Oh, how wonderful, Father, is your great redemption. And we're here this morning to rejoice in it. We're here this morning, Lord, to give you glory. Thank you for salvation. Thank you for deliverance from the enemy's camp. Thank you for paying off, oh God, the debt of our lives. And now we have and the gift of eternal life. Now I pray you'll anoint both speaker and hearers as we read your word and give us insight in Jesus Christ's name. We give ourselves to you unreservedly now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. the fourth chapter, Hebrews and the 12th verse. For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit, like you to notice between soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. And the 14th verse, seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast our profession. And I'd like you to turn to Genesis if you would please. Uh I'm going to read one verse out of chapter 2 which is verse 16. The reason I'm going back to the Genesis account. It's I I need to explain this to you is because we have read where the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword. We read of the of the position and the place of the word and what's been restored in our time. But now I want to see when that word became twisted, misrepresented. uh and when unbelief was introduced, it was introduced just with one word which we know well in the second chapter verse 16 says and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat. Start with Genesis the 3rd chapter verse 1. Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, "Yeah, hath God said that you shall not eat of the tree of the garden?" And the woman said unto the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die." And the serpent said unto the woman, "You shall not surely die. For God knoweth that in the day that you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. Amen. You may be seated. You may want to keep your Bibles open. And if you begin to feel the word of God speak to you, you can respond and that will be a blessing to me also. Excuse [clears throat] me. I will just uh uh I just want to start with this Genesis chapter for just a moment just for a few moments by way of introduction. Uh, I'd like you to notice in Genesis 3 and1 and the serpent uh, uh, there's three things I want you to see. The serpent said, the woman said, and God said, and to say something, there has to be an intent behind it. There has to be a thought. And a thought you know has to have an intent behind it. And the even the word that is used when the scripture I gave you now two or three times and God said let there be light doesn't even mean and and I asked the question many times and posed the question and I don't think we have the answer but it posed the question what sound was that? What language was that? What or was it a sound? uh it's written in words but perhaps the words that we have written in the Bible. The Bible says and and and God uh uh and and and God uh the Lord spake to Jeremiah. the Lord spake to but it doesn't say how he spake and whether it's in the language his mother tongue or is it something that's within is it is it something that is moved uh within we we don't know exactly God spoke in a dream God spoke by vision God spoke in a whirlwind uh all of these things we have the word of God in written form but multitudes and hundreds of millions of people have this written scripture and do not hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; And so it's more than just words on pages. Even though the prophet said this is God in written form, but they do not they're not able to capture &gt;&gt; the essence. They are not able to capture what is there for them. The promises can be there. And so this is what I'll be focusing on throughout the uh throughout the uh service. And and then when this and when the serpent first approached Eve and he said hath God said this verse one hath God said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden. Now I I'm not just giving a historical account. This is up todate. This fits every person here because there's a lesson here. A incredible valuable lesson. Satan misqued the statement in fact is God said you may freely eat of the you may freely this is all yours and then Satan now he comes and suggests uh hath God said and that's a question that you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and then the woman made her first error in entering into a dialogue into a discussion with Satan. And there isn't a person here that Satan hasn't spoken to. &gt;&gt; And probably there isn't a person here that hasn't made this same mistake. We start dissecting what he said and we start even responding to what he said and we start you know uh uh in our mind we begin to react and we begin to respond and and Satan has no doubt TOLD YOU ALL KINDS of things and then you begin to think about it and weigh it out. That's the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; We're not to do that. And so she responded and and now speaks no this is what the word said. This is what God said. And he said that we may eat of the trees of the garden, but of the tree of the uh of the tree of which is in the midst of the garden that God said, "You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die." And then the serpent comes in with uh with his u shot. Uh the serpent said to the woman, "You shall not surely die." He must like the word not because he used it in his first mis misquote and used it again when he came with his final statement. He said you shall not. Did God say that you shall not eat of the trees of the garden? Said no that's not what he said. He said we may eat of the tree of the garden but of this certain tree we must not partake of that. We must not partake of this lest we die. He said you shall not surely die. So now he's and and this is something that's for every person that's in here. Do not enter into a dialogue with this slicker. &gt;&gt; Do not enter into a reasoning with him. &gt;&gt; He knows this Bible better than you do. &gt;&gt; He knows this Bible better than you do. Probably better than you will ever know it. But he hasn't got the revelation that God gives to his children. He doesn't have any revelation. And so don't go to his level and begin to discuss or begin to dialogue with even the thoughts that he chose IN YOUR MIND. DON'T RESPOND to them. And then I would like you to notice this that the he what he appealed to he said and I'm just I wanting to take it a little easier just at the beginning and uh so he appealed to her reasoning which is in the spirit realm. He appealed to her sight. He appealed to her imagination, which is in the spirit realm. You'll be like gods. Uh he appealed to her hearing because she heard what he was saying or how she was saying it. He was saying it. So he appear he appears to these various parts of uh uh of the of the physical gates, the physical senses. &gt;&gt; Please see this. And the spirit senses of the spirit, the senses of the emotional realm, whether it be affection or imagination. He he appealed to her memory. hath God said appealed to her memory appealed to her see and she saw the tree and and she said it's good for food and this is this is delightful so he appealed to the senses &gt;&gt; that's what he did &gt;&gt; and that is why I read as a text for the word of God is quick and powerful &gt;&gt; and sharper than any two-edged sword &gt;&gt; piercing even to even to the dividing aunderder of soul and spirit. &gt;&gt; God has reserved that one channel to your soul for faith and Satan want to poke down unbelief. &gt;&gt; You shall not surely but he has to appeal to the reasoning before he can get that uh down to her. So I want to begin then with uh piercing even to the dividing of sunder which is the title of the service this morning. Piercing to the dividing aunderder and the word piercing is and this is this is important that you get this piercing is to go through to penetrate or to pierce. That's the beginning. But it comes from another word that is and this is where you have to take a another turn. It's to arrive. When something pierces, it arrives. Say this sword pierced through uh a board. It it arrived. It's on the other side. So it is also to arrive to be sufficient uh to be enough sufficient in ability and it comes from a a base word in the Greek which is to come to have come to have arrived to be present and metaphorically to come to one to seek an intimacy with one to become his follower to come upon one uh to come upon one of of uh uh that you're desiring to be with. So to come and so the word of God, the word of God, now I want you to think in terms of Christ is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword. For the word is a two-edged sword, piercing even through the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit. And in this age, if you want to just take the world at large, if you want to take the whole realm of entertainment, you want to take the whole realm of Hollywood or the world and any of you young people that are struggling with the world, I'll tell you how you're struggling. You're struggling with the senses. You're struggling with what you hear. &gt;&gt; You're struggling with what you see. Hey, you know, I I go by in the airports every once in a while and always the the duty free is there. How many have ever seen the dutyfree? You don't even have to say it. You can smell it. &gt;&gt; I tell my wife I don't need to put any aftershave on. I just have to walk past the dutyfree and I got enough to last me a day or two. But all all those fragrances, did you ever ever hear them advertised? They're so enticing. They all have an appeal, a sex appeal. &gt;&gt; To be honest with you, you folks, whether you say amen or not, I'm going to preach it. &gt;&gt; The whole world is given over to the senses. &gt;&gt; Hollywood is totally on the emotional realm. It's all senses. And the thing and and then the the church world adopted that. So they got people to move into maybe telling a sad story and then their hearts are moved and people begin and then brother Brandham even talks about it and people come and pray and and then they're saying to him, "Well, you you've been a you've been a rascal, but your mom prayed for you and don't you want to see her on the other side?" That's all appealing to the affections and the emotions at that level and that and then a person walks out and the devil says, "You didn't get anything." And he has to agree, "Yeah, I really didn't get anything. I had a I had a sob. I I cried a little bit. I thought about my mom. I thought about heaven. I thought about when she died. I thought about her praying. I thought about the good life she lived. I thought about what a what a scoundrel I am." and and that that goes nowhere, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because that's not a word-based &gt;&gt; experience. &gt;&gt; It's far better if you sit in your seat and hear the word preached &gt;&gt; and saying that's the truth. &gt;&gt; That is TAKING THE HIDE OFF MY BACK, BUT THAT'S THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; GOD'S WORD IS true &gt;&gt; and I AM GOING TO ACCEPT THAT &gt;&gt; and I'm going to deny the enemy. &gt;&gt; I DENY SATAN AND I ACCEPT THIS. I YIELD MYSELF to it and something will happen for you &gt;&gt; because that'll come by faith &gt;&gt; so he appealed to those things. But then the word of God says that it pierces even to the dividing of sunder. It pierces through. And I want to just bring it down very very quickly because I I've got a ways to go and I'm limited on my time. But Jesus Christ, the word in flesh, in this day, I'm just going to come right to the heart of it, pierced through. He arrived, he was sufficient to pierce through the veil of sinful human flesh and brought salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he was born and the word was, the Bible says, "And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us." And the Bible says, "In the land of Zabilon and the land of Nephilim, by the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the people which sat in darkness saw a great light." &gt;&gt; How come? Because a light penetrated that darkness. &gt;&gt; GOD WAS MADE FLESH AND GOD PIERCED THROUGH. OH MY. HE PIERCED THROUGH THE FALLEN condition of man. He came down to where man was and it they saw a great light and to them which sat in in the region of the shadow of death light is sprung up. Brother Brandham used another language another expression. He said he spoke of Christ a super sign and how that he stretched his tent down here to dwell and be a human being. HE STRETCHED HIS TENT. HE PIERCED THROUGH mortal and immortality. HE CAME DOWN. IT'S FALLEN AND AS DARK AS WE ARE. HE PIERCED THROUGH THE DARKNESS of Leodysia. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE PIERCED THROUGH all the denominational barriers. AND PIERCING THROUGH FURTHERMORE, IT HAD A THE ROOT WORD. HE ARRIVED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. The word arrived. HE SAID LUKE 17:30, "AND IN the day when THE SON OF MAN WILL BE REVEALED, IT'LL BE A DAY LIKE SODOM." WE GOT IT. &gt;&gt; WE GOT IT EVERYWHERE. IT'LL BE A DAY LIKE NOAH'S TIME. THEY PLANTED AND THEY SOLD AND THEY BUILT AND THEY DID ALL OF THESE THINGS. THE WHOLE WORLD IS covered with those two uh two descriptions. And Jesus said himself, "That'll be the day." Folks, we've arrived. Amen. &gt;&gt; I announce to you, he's arrived. &gt;&gt; He penetrated THROUGH THE FORCES. AND THE SCRIPTURE says of this, and you'll have to help me here now. The scripture says, and you're living in it, THE MOST DECEPTIVE AGE of all time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU WONDER SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A BATTLE." Of course you have a battle. I HAVE A STRUGGLE. OF COURSE YOU HAVE A STRUGGLE. Deception you can't just identify. It's not just a, you know, it's not just something that you can isolate and say, "Well, HERE THIS IS DECEPTION." IT'S EVERYWHERE. &gt;&gt; IT COVERS THE EARTH LIKE a like a wave. &gt;&gt; Deception. And furthermore, you want to take note of what I have to say today. The scripture says the deception will BE SO GREAT THAT IF it were possible the very elect will be saved. I mean will the very elect would be deceived. And so the word came to separate sharper than any two-edged sword piercing between truth and deception. How I thank God &gt;&gt; THAT HE WAS SUFFICIENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HOW I THANK GOD HE PENETRATED &gt;&gt; THROUGH THE ENEMY'S CAMP. &gt;&gt; HOW I THANK GOD THAT HE DESCENDED IN SATAN'S EDEN AND FOUND ME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HOW I THANK GOD HE PENETRATED THE DENOMINATIONAL BARRIER AND TORE THAT VEIL INTO &gt;&gt; AND EXPOSE THE MERCY SEAT ONCE AGAIN AND SAID HERE IT IS. HE'S ARRIVED. THE MERCY SEAT IS IN PLAIN VIEW. WHEN HE CAME IN FLESH AND HE WAS UH HANGING ON THE CROSS AND THE CRUCIFIXION AND THE MOST uh most unbelievable death marred more than that of any man. If you're going to look at it WITH YOUR EYES LOOKS LIKE A COMPLETE FAILURE. If you're going to listen to it with your ears, YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR CRUCIFY CRUCIFY GIVE US Barabbus and you might be influenced by that. If you were in if you were UH INFLUENCED BY THE MOB, YOU'D SURELY GET MOVED by that. And the PEOPLE WHO GOT HEALED, THE PEOPLE WHO ATE BREAD, &gt;&gt; CREATED FROM HIS HAND, &gt;&gt; DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING, didn't declare that they were with him. Oh, listen to me friends. BUT IT DIDN'T STOP HIM. HE PENETRATED THROUGH. And I THINK AFTER THE RESURRECTION, HE penetrated through the he HE HE PIERCED THROUGH the confusion &gt;&gt; of the two men on the way to Emmas. AND I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE MESSAGE. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING. HE WILL PENETRATE THROUGH YOUR DISAPPOINTMENTS. &gt;&gt; HE WILL PENETRATE THROUGH YOUR CONFUSION. HE WILL PIERCE THROUGH YOUR DARK MOMENT. AND HE'LL STAY WITH YOU UNTIL YOU KNOW IT'S HIM. &gt;&gt; HE'LL STAY WITH YOU TILL YOU KNOW HE'S ARRIVED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT SWORD IS SO SHARP, &gt;&gt; THAT SWORD IS SO PIERCING. Even between your emotions, WHEN EVERYTHING YOU SEE, EVERYTHING YOU FEEL, EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON WITH ON THE INSIDE, HE'LL SEPARATE THAT. AND HE'LL GIVE YOU A MESSENGER BEHIND THE PULPIT. HE'LL GIVE YOU A MESSENGER TO SPEAK THROUGH THAT message and you'll hear his voice and you'll know it's God speaking. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT'LL SEPARATE YOU. And I tell you, young men, young ladies, men and women of this congregation, in this day and age, God hasn't given us 10 ways. He hasn't given us five ways. He's given us one way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One faith, &gt;&gt; one word, one Lord, AND HE'LL SEPARATE YOU from the world that is SO TORMENTING. DON'T GIVE HIM, DON'T GIVE INTO your feelings. Well, I don't feel this. I DON'T FEEL THAT. FORGET WHAT YOU FEEL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FAITH. IT'S NOT FEELINGS. IT'S FAITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And if you can be moved, IF YOU CAN be moved by circumstance, HE WILL CREATE the circumstances to move you. But people of faith are not moved by circumstance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; And there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible, that's how far he pierced through. If it were possible, this sword of this word of this message reaches right to that point. If it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. This sword is so quick and powerful. It divides right to the point where it becomes impossible. &gt;&gt; Right to the point. ON THIS SIDE, IT'S POSSIBLE. ON THIS SIDE, it's impossible. &gt;&gt; It's impossible. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DECEIVE the elect. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I rejoice tonight. I REJOICE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO TRY TO ATTAIN IT THAT WORD HAS COME. &gt;&gt; THAT CHRIST IS PRESENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE'S ALREADY HERE. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN DECLARE WITH A CONFIDENCE IN YOUR HEART ACCORDING TO THIS WORD. IF I JUST CAN FIND THAT PLACE, I CANNOT BE DECEIVED. &gt;&gt; And I say if I can find that place, the elect will find that place. GOD WILL PUT IT IN YOUR HEART THIS morning to hear this word, to hear this. I CAN SAY TO YOU, IT'S A BURDEN OF the word of the Lord. Not here to preach a service. I have a burden of the word of the Lord THAT YOU MIGHT RECEIVE IT, THAT YOU MIGHT OBTAIN WHAT GOD has given us for this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. pierced the veil &gt;&gt; of denominations, crying out, "Come out of her, my people." &gt;&gt; Piercing the veil of traditions &gt;&gt; and denominations. We've all been exposed to those things. And exposing the mercy seat in the unveiling of God, a prophet declares, "The whole mercy seats sitting in plain view. ANYBODY CAN SEE IT. The veils rent. Glory to God. The whole mercy seat comes into plain view. So I say, do you see it? &gt;&gt; Do you see the mercy seat? &gt;&gt; When the word was revealed, the word revealed is the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF, DO I SEE THAT? DO I SEE NOT WITH THESE EYES, BUT DO I SEE THE MERCY SEAT? HAVE I OBTAINED THE MERCY THAT HAS COME IN THE UNVEILING OF GOD. FURTHER, he says how God could HAVE MERCY ON ON foul sinners as us. That's what the prophet says. On foul sinners as us when he hid himself was a mystery. And now it's in plain view &gt;&gt; or in full view. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ONLY IN PLAIN VIEW, IT'S IN FULL VIEW REVEALED BY HIS WORD. What is this word? His word of GOD IS SHARP AND POWERFUL, quick and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to dividing a sunder. I'm preaching this hard, friends. I'm preaching with this much energy because I'm not going to stop till you see it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO GET IT ACROSS in an hour, hour and a half WHEN I'VE BEEN PONDERING THESE things for months. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT THE WORD IS HERE. THE POWER IS HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S A POWERFUL WORD. IT'S A QUICK WORD. IT'S A SHARP WORD. AND IT'LL DIVIDE US UNDER. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE TR TROUBLED WITH TODAY. THIS WORD TODAY COMING OVER THIS PULPIT WILL DIVIDE US FROM YOUR SITUATION, FROM YOUR CONFUSION, FROM YOUR DISAPPOINTMENTS. HALLELUJAH. THE WORD IS NOT AFFECTED BY DISAPPOINTMENTS. SO, I'M DISAPPOINTED. WE ALL HAVE HAD DISAPPOINTMENTS. BUT THAT'S NOT TO AFFECT OUR BELIEF. HALLELUJAH. MY FAITH IS STALWART. YOUR FAITH CANNOT BE MOVED. Glory to God. Glory to God. I SAY IN THE FACE OF EVERY CONFUSION, OF EVERY DISAPPOINTMENT, WE ALL HAVE DISAPPOINTMENT. I SAY IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, IT CANNOT MOVE US. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Piercing through the piercing through the confusion of false teaching. My how we're so subjected to false teaching. All kinds of false teach. FALSE TEACHINGS INTRODUCED INTO THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; WHY? Because they don't only take one word away. Take many more than one word. I've had people say, "Brother Brandham said such and such." I go and search. Brother Brandham said nothing like that. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT? MAYBE THE PERSON IS INNOCENT. I DON'T I DON'T uh decianize the person, but I I have a right to believe what the prophet has said. &gt;&gt; I have a right to say what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; And if it and of something that's not in the word, then deny it. Just stay away FROM IT. &gt;&gt; BACK AWAY from it. &gt;&gt; Don't start to dialogue with it. &gt;&gt; Don't start to, you know, to have a discussion with it. THAT'LL ONLY LEAD deeper and deeper into the error. Right. &gt;&gt; I think that should be really followed. &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't don't start discussing things and you know if it's people want to believe what they want to believe that's fine. Piercing through disappointments from misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; Who's been more misunderstood than Jesus Christ himself? He said when they came came to his accusation and began to put him to the cross and call for his blood and they said what what was it? THEY SAID HE SAID HE'LL DESTROY THIS TEMPLE IN THREE DAYS AND RAISE IT UP IN THREE DAYS. WELL, he could have said you got me wrong. You don't understand what I was saying. I'm not referring to the temple you spent 46 years building. I'm referring to the temple of my body. The Bible SIMPLY SAYS HE SPAKE of the temple of his own body, BUT HE DIDN'T EXPLAIN IT TO THEM. &gt;&gt; He didn't enter into that dialogue because his mind, HIS WHOLE BEING WAS SET TO FULFILL THE WORD of God. &gt;&gt; And whatever NEEDS TO HAPPEN TODAY, WE SAY, "HERE I AM. &gt;&gt; GOD, DO WHATEVER you want to do with me. I'M HERE TO FULFILL THE FULFILL my purpose and to run this course with faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we went back a wee bit to the beginning and found how Satan introduced himself into the human into humanity. And in the masterpiece, he said his enemy came in and found this great masterpiece. talking about the masterpiece family and by deceit he crawls under the garden walls. We may think of the garden, the garden of Eden, the garden walls, but he talks about the walls of the word. There was protected this enemy. And he's, if that was his nature back then, he's of the same mind this morning. &gt;&gt; If he can find a way to crawl under the walls that protect you. And the wall that protects you is this word. &gt;&gt; I'm going to really be heavy on this word. This word possesses what you need. Amen. &gt;&gt; This word has what you need. &gt;&gt; And what we have to find and and I want to strain stress this morning is h how we obtain that in a physical way. Maybe we need to not mechanically just listen to more message but it's how we approach it and how we hear. What do you hear when you hear it? What do you read? What do you see when you see it? And and then he asks uh he said he crawled under the garden wall and then he marred this beautiful masterpiece. He marred it so that it fell. He asks a little further down. How did he do it? When this masterpiece was walled by the word of God, God's word, you are walled by the same one. &gt;&gt; There isn't anything different between Adam and Eve and you and I. We're walled and protected by the same word. But if if Satan can succeed in making us think, well, it's for another time. It was another season, it's in the past, it's in the future, that's a lie. Don't let him introduce that to you. Say, well, there's a, you know, there's uh inconsistencies in the message, etc. There's no inconsistencies with the revelation. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said 700 when he meant 7,000 or whatever. One place talks about burning up the wheat instead of the chaff. Well, and then people make an issue. That's nonsense. That doesn't mean anything to me. It doesn't change the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; What he said expose the Jesus Christ in the scripture. And what a transforming power &gt;&gt; it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the revelation of the word. This message came to reveal Christ. And the revelation of Jesus Christ is not an error. &gt;&gt; It's not irreconcilable. It is absolutely true. &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that this morning? &gt;&gt; If you go out beyond the wall of the word, Satan has opportunity to mar the work of God. And I I cannot say that and stress that enough. I've seen people that have sat in this congregation that have gone out and they've gone out beyond the word of God. And when you go all out beyond the message of the hour that has been presented to us with vindication, then we are exposed exposing ourselves to all kinds of attack by the enemy &gt;&gt; in the spoken word. He said, ' Do you realize it was one word that Eve doubted that caused all the trouble? One spoken word of God. Now, Eve may have not heard the word not, but it was conveyed to her. And Satan's intent when God spoke and said, "You may eat, and this you may not touch." When God spoke, he had a certain intention for his children. When Satan, then the serpent, spoke and introduced something else to her, he had an intention. It wasn't just to get her to believe that, oh, I I can do that. No, it was the intent of creating her fall. &gt;&gt; That was his intent. &gt;&gt; His intent. Furthermore, I don't know if you're hope you're spiritually minded because God God the prophet said his great desire his first great desire in Christ the mystery of God revealed is to express himself. &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us in Isaiah that Satan desired to be where God was. And the struggle today is Satan desires for expression. &gt;&gt; And when you walk down the streets of any city, what you'll find is an expression of Satan. &gt;&gt; Until we can actually say that's demons and flesh. &gt;&gt; No use fooling around with that, friends. That's devils and flesh. &gt;&gt; HELL HAS COME to the surface. You see it everywhere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I want to say that the word has come to Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; That's what I believe. I'm going to preach WHAT I BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; CHRIST, the word has come to Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And he WILL EXPRESS HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE HAS CHOSEN HIS BRIDE and he's going to give her his seed and she's going to bring forth the manifestation of Jesus Christ. And we might say, "Well, I'm seeking to see the manifestation." You follow some of the things that I have to say here today and you'll see more of it. But we have you need people need to open their eyes to see that we have seen it. &gt;&gt; We do see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. one word that she doubted. He said Eve doubted to be the truth and it caused every sickness, every disease, every suffering baby caused every hospital to be built. Every operation was ever performed, every death that ever died for one person disbelieve one word, there you are. All right. If now that Eve doubted one word and caused all of that, if that is changed, &gt;&gt; if we reverse that &gt;&gt; and say there's a people, there's another woman &gt;&gt; on the earth. &gt;&gt; SHE'S THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; And she will believe every word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I MAY NOT UNDERSTAND EVERY WORD. &gt;&gt; I may not even be expecting a certain sound. But if I say in my heart, I believe every word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it's a it's an attitude, friends. &gt;&gt; It's an attitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then what what will it do? I'm probably going to I hope I don't fail in conveying this. There's more that the message, the actual word of the message, it's a word within a word. You can read a message. I have a message which I just printed off this morning. spiritual adoption. Just very very brief message, but there was something in there and I I had read it and it meant so much to me. So I wanted to I printed it out and I was reading it. And uh there's much more within the message. It's not just some words on a piece of paper. It's not even just some words that you will hear in the tape, but there's an intent of the author &gt;&gt; behind that word. &gt;&gt; There is a there is a a revelation. And I've said in previous services, I want to say it again. The revelation of what was spoken, that is the interpretation. That is the voice of God to the individual. Does that go over your head? You understand? Something that's revealed is something that wasn't known before. &gt;&gt; And so when God speaks through his word, even through a service that's being preached or you hear a tape or you read a scripture or you read a message book and then and then something comes alive &gt;&gt; that's quick. &gt;&gt; It's quickened. &gt;&gt; It comes alive. &gt;&gt; Then you need to ponder that. You need to take and absorb that. &gt;&gt; Say, "What are you trying to absorb?" I'm trying to absorb the content. &gt;&gt; Not what my mind can wrestle with, but the content. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says faith is unconscious. &gt;&gt; You might think that this, you know, you might think that I'm going way sideways here, but I I I want you to I want you to I want to convey this to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a content. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says that faith is unconscious. &gt;&gt; You may not even be aware that it's happening, &gt;&gt; but your attitude, &gt;&gt; your approach &gt;&gt; makes it available to you. &gt;&gt; AND THEN YOU'LL FIND OUT down the road, what did I do? What did I do to gain this glorious honor? The answer to my prayer. &gt;&gt; What did I do? &gt;&gt; You didn't really do anything. It may have just been the way you approached it. I I must not get ahead of myself. [clears throat] I've been around some believers. I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, but they're very affected by dreams. That's fine. We all have dreams, but don't count on them. Don't count on them. I've had good ones and bad ones in the last two weeks. And I'm not up here preaching dreams. &gt;&gt; I've been around people before I'm done, they've told me two or three dreams, and those dreams of influencing their life and so on so forth. I say they'd be better off if they stayed awake and read a message. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then you go to sleep and have a dream. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the word of God? I asked Wednesday. I've asked in the previous service. What is the word of God? The word of God, listen closely now, is the self-revelation of the one true God &gt;&gt; to those individuals of his choosing. &gt;&gt; Shall I say that again? &gt;&gt; The word of God, that's what the word of God is in my and I've spent a lot of time on this. The word of God is the self-revelation of God. &gt;&gt; He reveals himself as a self-revelation of God to of the one true God to those specific individuals. Call them elect, call them whatever you want, &gt;&gt; to the individuals of his own choosing. &gt;&gt; If he chooses to make himself known &gt;&gt; to an individual, THAT'S IT. ALL YOU WANT TO SAY IS LET IT BE me Lord. &gt;&gt; Here I am. &gt;&gt; What is the word of God? It's his self-revelation. And secondly, by whatever means he chooses to reveal or make himself known. &gt;&gt; That's right. Prophet said in the unveiling of God he used a whirlwind pillar of fire struck struck Paul down with a great light. He chose the time. &gt;&gt; He chose the place. &gt;&gt; And Paul was struck down by transforming power. &gt;&gt; HE WAS TRANSFORMED. &gt;&gt; WHY? What was what was was the transformation power in the light or was it in the voice that spoke to him? I would say it's a combination of that plus his approach by ye by uh by confessing that this has to be the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Who art thou Lord? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Am I getting through to you? &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT JUST A MESSAGE BOOK. IT'S NOT JUST A TAPE. IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST THE BIBLE, but it is what do we DO WHEN GOD SAYS something to us through it, &gt;&gt; speaks to us. I've I I'm coming home. I'm coming home to where people live. I've seen meetings where people been greatly moved. &gt;&gt; I've seen this altar full of people. I've seen young people weep and and shout and and have an wonderful. WHERE ARE YOU TODAY? &gt;&gt; Where are you this morning? &gt;&gt; What did you do with it? &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; What do we do with it? &gt;&gt; WAS IT GOD &gt;&gt; OR WASN'T it God? And if it was God, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT? &gt;&gt; DID HE SPEAK? YES. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY HE SPOKE. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE WORD? &gt;&gt; AND YOU SIT HERE TODAY AND SAY, "WELL, I WANT GOD TO DO SOMETHING." GOD WANTS YOU TO DO SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO APPROACH IT WITH REVERENCE. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO APPROACH IT WITH GREAT LOVE &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "THAT WAS REALITY." AND I WILL NEVER LET THAT GO. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF TEMPTATION COMES MY WAY. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF HARDSHIP COMES MY WAY. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF DISAPPOINTMENTS. AND LISTEN TO ME, YOUNG PEOPLE. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T CARE WHAT THE NEXT GUY DOES. [applause] &gt;&gt; I'M SO TIRED OF HEARING, "WELL, MY FRIEND, WHO CARES? MAYBE THEY'RE NOT YOUR FRIENDS." &gt;&gt; I mean, YOUR FRIENDS ARE GIVING YOU THAT KIND OF INFLUENCE. IF THEY GIVE YOU THAT KIND OF INFLUENCE, THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT YOUR FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; IT'S SATAN TRYING TO TAKE YOU TO HELL. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO WE DO WITH IT? &gt;&gt; THEN WE SAY, "WELL, I WANT TO SEE GOD DO SOMETHING." LET YOURSELF BE IN A PLACE WHERE HE CAN DO SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; GOD IS RIGHT HERE. Hang on. &gt;&gt; Your approach to the divine gift brings the results. &gt;&gt; Now, don't make the terrible mistake of saying, "Oh, it was back there when brother Brandham was here." I tell you what, if God has not given the five-fold ministry to the church, and that five-fold ministry is divine gifts to the church, &gt;&gt; any man who gives himself to prayer and to study and to minister the word of God, he if he he might do it for a living if that's what his mind is set on, but otherwise, it's a divine gift that God sends to the church. It's a it's an excruciating, painful, burdensome because you're bearing burdens and and we're concerned ABOUT PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY WE STAND HERE AND PREACH. WE DECLARE THE TRUTH. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET, you know, a gold star on our on our book. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. WE'RE HERE TO EVEN SAY THINGS SOMETIMES IS COMING TO CHURCH. I WONDER and I'm sure brother John, brother Tom, brother Ernie who, brother Andy's senior and and and you AS AN INDIVIDUAL SOMETIME as parents, as a father, as a mother, you have to say things to your children that ARE HARD TO SAY, BUT YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; SO I SAY SAY IT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU KNOW IT'S TRUTH, JUST SAY IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And a and a prophet says in the believest thou this he said it's your approach. &gt;&gt; So I want to stay with that. IT'S YOUR APPROACH to a divine gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That brings the results. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. WE'RE INTERESTED IN RESULTS. &gt;&gt; WHO DOESN'T WANT RESULTS? BUT HE SAYS IT'S YOUR APPROACH &gt;&gt; TO THE DIVINE GIFT, &gt;&gt; NOT A GIFT OF, YOU KNOW, A THOUSAND YEARS AGO OR 50 YEARS AGO OR A GIFT THAT MIGHT COME. THE GIFT OF GOD THAT'S WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; I believe that A GOOD GODLY WIFE ACCORDING to the prophet's message IS A DIVINE GIFT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND FOR A WIFE TO HAVE A HUSBAND THAT SEEKS TO BE A PROTECTOR AND WANTS TO BE A SPIRITUAL HEAD TO THE HOME AND WANTS TO BE AN EXAMPLE TO THE CHILDREN, THAT'S A DIVINE GIFT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Don't sit here and put it elsewhere. &gt;&gt; Don't use a shovel. Use a rake &gt;&gt; and PULL IT IN. &gt;&gt; SAY THAT BELONGS TO ME. &gt;&gt; THAT APPLIES TO MY SITUATION. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; In the ministry of Christ, he spoke of this woman. ARE YOU STILL WITH ME? &gt;&gt; He said she pressed right through. Never paid any attention. THERE ISN'T ANYBODY HERE THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO PUSH STUFF ASIDE. PRESS through the unbelief. And I said, SPEAKING ESPECIALLY TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE just for this moment, YOU HAVE TO PRESS THROUGH ALL THE PEER PRESSURE. I READ THE QUESTIONS. Brother John, thank you for sending ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE DISCUSSED. I CAN TELL you the answer to almost every one of THOSE QUESTIONS IS YOUR ATTITUDE towards the word of God. If you have the RIGHT ATTITUDE, THAT STUFF, YOU'LL BRUSH IT ASIDE. YOU SAY, "I DON'T CARE WHAT MY FRIENDS DO. I DON'T CARE WHAT WEAKNESS I SEE IN THE MINISTRY. I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT I HEAR ABOUT THE MESSAGE. IN FACT IS I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT THIS WORD OF GOD. I KNOW THAT'S God's word. &gt;&gt; GOD VINDICATED THIS WORD. &gt;&gt; And if you don't THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE, JUST THINK ABOUT THAT VINDICATION. I HAVE FOR YEARS. I have since I was 17, 18 years old. The same vindication. I would just lay THERE AND WEEP. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WHY DO WHY HAVE YOU COME DOWN HERE? WHY HAVE YOU DONE WHY ARE YOU REVEALING THE SECRET OF THE HEART IN REVEALING THEIR HEART? YOU REVEAL MY OWN HEART. &gt;&gt; AND MY HEART IS REVEALED. I LOVE THIS. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, BUT I LOVE THIS ATMOSPHERE. &gt;&gt; IT'S SO MUCH LIKE JESUS CHRIST. AND IT TOOK ME YEARS TO FIND OUT IT WAS JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I'm so moved by it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM, GOOD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; And another thing, DON'T GET JEALOUS BECAUSE YOU SEE SOMEONE ELSE DOING THE RIGHT THING AND THEY FALL UNDER THE BLESSING OF GOD. SAY, "HOW DID THEY GET THAT WIFE? HOW DID THEY GET THAT HUSBAND? HOW COME THEY GOT GOOD THINGS? HOW COME THIS GOOD THING'S HAPPENING?" BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT ATTITUDE TOWARD THE WORD. And then you see PEOPLE GOING THROUGH TERRIBLE TIME, terrible time. And God allows his children TO GO THROUGH TERRIBLE TIMES. But that person who's who's anchored, THAT PERSON WHO'S WALKING BY FAITH, that person who's walking by the relationship even though they come to disappointments and you and your friend are on the way to Emmas and say, "YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS MESSAGE HAS FAILED US. HERE WE COUNTED on it. here. He made BREAD AND WE THOUGHT HE'S GOING TO BE A KING AND ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS AND NOW IT'S ALL DRIBBLED AWAY. IT'S ALL EVAPORATED. AND RIGHT WHILE HE THOUGHT IT ALL EVAPORATED, THE GREATEST THING WAS WALKING RIGHT BESIDE THEM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And I WANT TO SAY TO YOU IN THIS CHURCH THIS MORNING, NOT BECAUSE IT'S CLOVERDALE BIBLE WAY, BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE A RESPECT TO THAT MESSAGE. I HAVE A RESPECT TO THAT MESSAGE. AND IF GOD HAS DONE ANYTHING good to this congregation or anything, allowed us any place in his kingdom, IT'S BECAUSE WE RESPECT HAVE THAT RESPECT FOR THAT MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I RESPECT it more than you PEOPLE REALIZE. I LOVE THAT MESSAGE WITH all my heart. &gt;&gt; TO ME, IT'S THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST &gt;&gt; WALKING here in 2012. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HEALING LIKE HE ALWAYS DID, brother Ricardo. Glory to God. I &gt;&gt; tell you what friends, if I told you what God is doing and what he is saying, some of you would it would it would surprise you &gt;&gt; big time. &gt;&gt; Surprise you. &gt;&gt; God God is doing things on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so he said in the Queen of Sheba, he said, "Well, it depends on what you think it is." It depends on what you think it is. Not only back then he was saying it the approach to the divine gift. I'm going to lay it out. It's actually the respect for the ministry that God gave them. And we still have that same ministry. &gt;&gt; If we're not here in support of this messenger's ministry, we might as well close the doors and go home. We're here. &gt;&gt; You may even wonder about the school. What's the school all about? It is I just in hopes. It's in hopes and in trust and in belief that we'll have Holy Ghost teachers that will that will INSTRUCT THE CHILDREN AND GIVE THEM AN atmosphere &gt;&gt; for THEM TO RESPOND IN. He said, "It depends." He's speaking to a woman. "It depends on what you think it is." Now, try to get this. If you think it's If you think it's a evil devil, then you get his reward. If you believe that it's the Lord Jesus according to his promise, what I've been preaching, then you have his reward. Both rewards were present are present. Both those rewards are present this morning. &gt;&gt; I don't put myself in that prophec. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I prayed for a man this morning. He's not able to be here right now. But I prayed for him. I never prayed for him like this before. But my heart was moved and I said, "God, I need him. I need him. His life has influenced me. His life has affected me and I ask you to allow him to be here. Bring him here." That was my prayer this morning. I'm so thankful. I have been moved. I I've been moved by my own family. I've been moved by the family of God. Your life has influenced me. I like I I love to see I've been working with some of you young men and I just observe h how you do things and how you move about and how resilient you are and how respectful you are. God sees that. &gt;&gt; Absolutely sees that. Maybe you're not walking just exactly where you want to be. God sees that, too. Maybe everything isn't happening just the way you want it to happen. God sees that as well. But if you have this, if you have that kind of respect &gt;&gt; to God's word, &gt;&gt; you'll come out of that situation. &gt;&gt; The word will penetrate. It will pierce &gt;&gt; between your disappointment &gt;&gt; and what I don't CARE WHAT THE SOURCE of the disappointment is, but it will pierce through &gt;&gt; and the piercing will make you aware someone else is here. &gt;&gt; This is a different kind of a stranger that's walking with me. &gt;&gt; Is it all right, folks? Amen. &gt;&gt; You can just put this in your heart and you go home and figure it out. It depends what you think this is. Said, "Well, is it just Brother Ed down there yelling?" You know, and I'm kind of I don't know where he's at. tell you when the prophet of God spoke the seals nobody knew where he was at &gt;&gt; but how much we've gotten out of it today &gt;&gt; and then he said there will be others that will take this message &gt;&gt; and I just announced to you I'm one of those &gt;&gt; and there may be other brethren here that are one of them &gt;&gt; and we are all here as one body we're all here to proclaim what does this church and what does this congregation do I've been going over the last 40 years and and and and you don't have enough time today and you don't have enough time this week. My wife, she just going she's got a little calendar and she keeps it little Hallmark calendars and puts on that we're going to Norway and then we're go going from there to to South Africa and going from there over to India and so on so forth. And I said, I got tired reading reading that. And I read this morning where brother Brandham went by went by train or something. Went by went all the way to California and preached and preached again and took 60some hours getting back home by train. I don't even know. And he says that's day before yesterday and I'm he said I I've been, you know, just so exhausted and I I I I sometime here you can do that. You just read the message yourself and see where that message was and realize where he is the next night and the next night and the next night and that he either drove and sometimes he drove almost every time from one place to another to another. It was just absolutely incredible. THIS MESSAGE HAS NOT COME to us cheap. &gt;&gt; This message has come to US AT GREAT COST. WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT 68 million who gave their lives. PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES ALL DOWN THROUGH THE YEARS AND YOU'RE GIVING YOUR LIFE. And the prophet said, "It's not only those who gave their life, gave their life and was martyed, but those who have lived &gt;&gt; and given their lives AND YOU'RE HERE AND YOU'RE ALIVE. &gt;&gt; We are CALLED ON BY GOD. GIVE OUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE &gt;&gt; God has put IN YOUR HANDS. GIVE YOUR lifemen &gt;&gt; without any hesitation. I wish I had the use of some of you young men, you young ladies. I'll tell you what, there's a fire burning in my soul. It's not an old fire. It's a young firemen. &gt;&gt; And I've had that fire since a young man &gt;&gt; and I'm TRYING TO PASS IT OFF. SOMEONE HAS TO PICK UP PICK UP THIS RESPONSIBILITY. And your parents are gaining age and they're they're getting older as well. YOU YOU YOUNG LADIES, YOU WANT TO BE THE KIND OF YOUNG WOMEN, the kind of mothers that Jesus Christ is proud of, &gt;&gt; THAT PLEASES HIM. AND YOU'LL FIND IN YOUR GREAT HOUR OF YOUR GREAT hour of trial and sorrow. I talked about Sister Larga. Don't forget, friends, she lost a husband. DON'T FORGET that she had years of bringing up those babies and those children. She had years where she didn't even know where her next meal was coming from. BUT ONE THING NEVER CHANGED. THIS MESSAGE AND HER APPROACH TO THIS MESSAGE. AND SOMEHOW I want TO ANNOUNCE TO YOU, GOD SMILED ON THAT WOMAN. GOD SMILED IN THAT HOME. &gt;&gt; And this is not to be a discouragement to anybody, but there isn't one of those young people. OF THE WHOLE EIGHT OF THEM, NONE OF THEM WENT TO THE WORLD. NONE OF THEM EVEN CRAVE THE WORLD. NONE OF THEM ARE INTERESTED in the world. LISTEN FRIENDS, THAT'S NOT JUST A FAVOR FOR ONE PERSON. THAT IS PRESENT HERE FOR YOU AND I. &gt;&gt; I say in the name of Jesus Christ, LET THE WORLD BE CUT AWAY FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THEIR FASHION. &gt;&gt; DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THEIR ENTERTAINMENT. &gt;&gt; DON'T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THE THINGS THAT THEY DO. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WAGES OF SIN ARE DEATH, &gt;&gt; BUT THE GIFT OF GOD IS ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; In the face of every defeat, in the face of every foe, we declare victory. &gt;&gt; Our attitude to the divine word. [snorts] I have here my note. Jesus was the word. He is the word. And the attitude that people took towards his person. his person was in fact their attitude to the thoughts of God regarding the redemption of the world. So the attitude that people had towards his person was in fact their attitude to the thoughts of God for he was the expression of the thoughts of God. It depends on what you think. Brother Brandham and Jesus Christ the same yesterday. Do you have a few more minutes? Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "If this woman standing here, a stranger to me, I don't know her and she don't know me, God knows her." &gt;&gt; Well, then the only way I'd have knowing anything, what she was here for would have to come, listen close, would have to come from some supernatural resource. That's what always has affected me. &gt;&gt; That supernatural resource. Where does this come from? &gt;&gt; I know it comes from God because it's holy. &gt;&gt; I know it comes from God because it it has a it bears the a trademark of the humility of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Gordon Lindsay's daughter or wife was standing. Says a little 1930s car pulled up. She's at the sink looking out the window and a man steps out and she said it was just a such a spirit of humility overwhelmed her inside the house over the kitchen &gt;&gt; and she broke into weeping &gt;&gt; and wept. The same man reached behind a door where my wife was standing as a girl 12 years old and shook her hand, stopped and came back a step or two and shook her hand. Could have been any one of you girls. God bless you little sister &gt;&gt; at 12 years old said give your way to the to the Lord and he will direct your path &gt;&gt; and he will give you the desire of your heart and he went on in the crowd and the rush and she stood behind the door and just presence come over and she just begin to weep. Did the weeping do it? No. It was the presence. &gt;&gt; And now you see a woman that is in her 70s, but that has never left. &gt;&gt; That respect HAS NEVER LEFT. THAT ATTITUDE has never left. And I'm seeking and admonishing you. YOU CAN HAVE THE SAME APPROACH. &gt;&gt; Say amen, folks. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE IN NEED. YOU'RE IN NEED. &gt;&gt; WE'RE IN NEED. WE WANT TO SEE GOD DO THINGS. THIS IS HOW YOU HAVE TO START. &gt;&gt; THE WOMAN IS THERE. SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE ANSWER. SAY IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK THIS IS. I'M BRINGING IT HOME. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS? &gt;&gt; WELL, I think I'm in church. It's got to You got to think a lot more than that. &gt;&gt; Well, I think that it's been a long service. You got to think a whole lot more than that. And you got to think a whole lot different than that. &gt;&gt; Well, I think brother ED'S NOT GETTING HIS POINT ACROSS. THAT MIGHT BE SO, BUT YOU GOT TO THINK DIFFERENT than that. You got to say, "FATHER, I KNOW ONE THING. YOU'RE TRUE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE REALITY. FATHER, I KNOW ONE THING MORE. I'M HERE BECAUSE I HAVE A CERTAIN NEED. I'M HERE BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY." AND THEN GOD WILL COME to that. Or you CAN GO ON THE WAY THAT YOU ARE &gt;&gt; AND IT'LL GO ON FOR A LONG TIME AND PROBABLY DRIBBLE OUT AND NOT NOT be too effective. But you can just decide this going to be different for me. &gt;&gt; This is this going to be a different service for me. I'm looking down on you. This is GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT MEETING. &gt;&gt; I'm going to HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; This woman standing here, it'll have to come from a supernatural resource. He said, "And is that right, lady?" Well, it depends. And you all know what that word, it depends on what you think it was. &gt;&gt; And that would determine whether you get what you ask for. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I've come home. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now I've come to where you live. If you haven't asked God for something, then I'm in question of you. I'm in question of you as a believer. BUT IF YOU'VE ASKED God for something, and as I said Wednesday, we all have asked God for things and we haven't seen the answer. And we may not because even no is an answer. Silence is an answer. &gt;&gt; All of those are an answer. BUT THEY DON'T CHANGE A BELIEVER'S ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; We all live. We may experience sickness. WE MAY EXPERIENCE DEATH. WE MAY EXPERIENCE ALL KINDS of things. BUT THIS IS THE WAY IF YOU HAVE TO DIE, THIS IS THE WAY YOU WANT TO DIE. &gt;&gt; You didn't really Come on. &gt;&gt; It depends on what you think. &gt;&gt; NOT WHAT SHE BESIDE you or your mother or your father. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. &gt;&gt; I want all the young people looking up this way. You make your notes later. I want to ask you a question. And I want you to ask yourself the question, what do you think it is? &gt;&gt; What do you think it is? &gt;&gt; Well, you had your teams on Friday night and you listed all kinds of your questions and I thought it was excellent and I thought the questions were very good. I was moved by those question. What's the answer? Where's the answers? Or do we just have the same questions at another time? Where where's the answer to those questions? Is it it just a desk discussion and a dialogue? I don't know how long brother Bis will be here with you, but I'll tell you this. You have the answer and I'm going to prove it to you in a moment. You have the answer actually with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The answer is in this word. Say, what is the word of God? The answer is in we can say, well, it's a message and you hear message, message, message. We hear revelation, revelation, revelation. Where is the word? Is it a sound or is it a tape playing? I know people that woke up a tape playing. I know a family of five boys and when they were the age of you fellas here, they they woke up every morning to a tape playing and I heard the prophet's voice and the prophet's voice. To my knowledge, not one of them are following the message today. It was a mechanical thing. It's not a bunch of mechanics. &gt;&gt; It's the person. The person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did those fellas HAVE DISAPPOINTMENTS? YEAH, THEY had disappointment. Did things go backwards? Yeah. Did they HAVE SICKNESS? YEAH, THEY DID. Did death happen in the family? Yeah, death happened in the family. I buried both mother and dad. They had all of that. They went right from dad's funeral over to one place and all were having a can of beer a piece. I'm not against the fact they had a beer if that's the best thing that they got. That wasn't the sin. The sin was they had a chance &gt;&gt; to get acquainted &gt;&gt; with a person. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they missed that. &gt;&gt; They missed that. &gt;&gt; IF YOU MISS THAT, OF COURSE, YOU'RE GOING TO GO to other things. Of course, I God help me. &gt;&gt; THAT'S JUST THE WORLD. THAT'S THE WAY THAT IT IS. &gt;&gt; I GOOD FRIENDS. I HAVE GOOD FRIENDS I SAT WITH. WE LIVED IN THE SAME ROOM AND AND ONE went to the world and and and I tried, BUT IT DIDN'T FIT. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD WASN'T MY THING. AND I WOULD READ THE LIFE story of BROTHER BEN BRANAMAN BULL LIKE A BABY CUZ THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE. &gt;&gt; AND I SAID I WANT THAT. &gt;&gt; WHEN I SEE SISTER L HERE ALL THESE YEARS LATER 50 60 YEARS LATER SEE A WOMAN STANDING ON THE PLATFORM THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU SEE THE VIDEO THAT'S WHY I HAVE HER THERE BECAUSE I'M standing there and my daughter Linda came up and gave her a bouquet. I said, the prophet said, give him a a bouquet better now, a rose now, than a whole bouquet later. I just want to honor her AND RESPECT HER. GOD RESPECTED HER. WHY WOULDN'T I RESPECT HER? [cheering] &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE SOMETHING TO THE PERSON. WHY WOULDN'T I WANT IT? &gt;&gt; Don't sit back and say, "Well, you know, he's lucky or she's lucky or they had AN EASY LIFE." NONSENSE. THEY MAY HAVE HAD THE HARDEST LIFE IN THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; But one thing you fellas, maybe you think I'm a but I walk through the woods and I look at a flower, little wild flower out there and I just look at that beauty. I just weep. So wonderful. So wonderful. I didn't have a prophet that told me God was in creation, but I was communicating with that God. &gt;&gt; That God's in the flower in your yard. &gt;&gt; We need to take time and SAY, "OH, FATHER, HERE I AM." &gt;&gt; AND I BRING HIM DOWN TO YOU, FRIENDS. I WANT TO BRING IT to you. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS PART OF THIS PIERCING, DIVIDING A SUNDER. &gt;&gt; HE SEPARATED YOU. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. JUST THINK OF IT. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE ELSE, BUT YOU'RE HERE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT SWORD OF THE WORD HAS SEPARATED YOU &gt;&gt; FROM THE WORLD. AND AND HE'S HERE TRYING TO SAY, YOU'RE NOT OF THEM. YOU'RE MINE. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to take a couple more minutes. In another serves, we would see Jesus. So the word doesn't contradict himself. God's word always runs perfectly smooth through the Bible. Now this statement then this one little woman had done all she could. The doctors had done all they could. And they were honest and couldn't help the woman. She had an issue of blood and she was thin and frail and she'd heard of him and she believed he was a holy man of God. Now there it is. It's her approach. Now listen. He says, "Are you ready?" And I say this congregation, I want to echo his words. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Are you ready? It's your approach. It depends on what you think about it. &gt;&gt; I don't want this service just to end. I want you to be asking yourself, what do I think about this? Why am I here? Am I here because my friends are here or because other couples are here? Or why are we here? I want you to be here because you are desperately in love &gt;&gt; with this person called Jesus Christ. who's revealed himself. He has revealed himself, the person of Jesus Christ. Not just to gather here in a service, but when you go home and when you're about your work or wherever you are, &gt;&gt; he can be just as real at that time. That's right. &gt;&gt; It says when he comes into a meeting to vindicate himself, touch him once and find out if he's the high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. I'm going to end with this in a moment. This quiet service and I want you thinking real deep. If you never hear me again, you hear this. You can touch him. &gt;&gt; You have the ability, inner ability to touch him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you touch him? Say, "Okay, brother Biscll, how do I touch him?" He just finished telling you, "It depends what you think about it. you your mind and your whole being and your approach it's what you think about him and that will that will touch him about two things I want to go to how do we touch him and depending on what what does it depend on he said it's a very beautiful picture today of people who have never seen God and maybe have never seen a move of God, but yet with reverence to his word move up into the realm. &gt;&gt; You've said, "Well, you were in the prophet's meetings. I've never seen that." Brother Brandham is speaking to you. So, you never been in a meeting. You've never been there. And he says, "Furthermore, maybe you've never seen a move of God. Maybe you've never seen anything of a supernatural nature. Are you listening?" But yet with reverence, &gt;&gt; go home and look it up. But yet with reverence to his word, move up &gt;&gt; into the realm. &gt;&gt; WHAT REALM? WHAT REALM IS THIS? IT'S A REALM WHERE I ACTUALLY CAN RECEIVE AND obtain the thing I'M CRAVING. &gt;&gt; The realities of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. says there are people sitting here perhaps that's dying with cancer with heart trouble that's never seen a healing service where they prayed for the sick maybe come out of churches and their theology condemns it but yet something within them is moving them out to take a stand tonight for divine healing yet has never seen a miracle performed. But it's but there's something and brother Brandham keeps using the word there's something and that's why Wednesday I said I'm having trouble identifying or or or being specific with it but I know that the word of God that has come to us. We have 1100 and some tapes. I'm stirred because many people call themselves MESSAGE BELIEVERS HAVE NO CLUE OF THE PERSON who is being revealed with those words. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST A IT'S NOT A SERIES OF ENGLISH WORDS. IT'S NOT A SERIES OF FRENCH WORDS, German words, &gt;&gt; Russian words, ANY OTHER kind of words. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IDENTIFIED THAT WAY. But whatever language you speak, that person who I'm talking about today who has HE HAS PENETRATED, HE'S PIERCED THROUGH THIS GENERATION. &gt;&gt; HE'S COME INTO THIS GODLESS, SINLESS, PERVERTED AGE. &gt;&gt; He has arrived &gt;&gt; AND HE IS SUBSTANTIAL. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU FACE. HE'S MORE THAN ADEQUATE. THE POINT OF THIS sword of THE WORD, IT FELL INTO THE PROPHET'S HANDS, BUT THAT SWORD OF THE WORD IS IN YOUR HAND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE? Do you know why you're here? THAT IT MIGHT BE FULFILLED WHICH WAS SPOKEN OF BY THE PROPHET MALACHI. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God honors his word. He's spoken THROUGH THE PROPHET MALACHI. HE'S SPOKEN THROUGH other He SPOKE THROUGH JESUS CHRIST lips himself. &gt;&gt; All that the father hath given me. &gt;&gt; WELCOME. &gt;&gt; ARE you here? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A GIFT OF THE FATHER &gt;&gt; TO JESUS CHRIST? &gt;&gt; All that the father hath given me &gt;&gt; will come &gt;&gt; and I will lose none of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Bren says, "Five or six years ago, I was called to a hospital where a boy had black dtheria and was dying and the doctor wouldn't let me go in on a on a kind of on account of my boy and my little girl." And he said, "The boy's dying and there's nothing you can do for him." And the old father and mother stood there and said, "We want him to go in anyhow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The parents of the boy said, "We want, brother, we want him to go in anyhow." And the mother bowed on one side and the father on the other side and the little nurse stood at the end. He says, "I I never done a thing but just asked God, let the boy live." Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he was about 15 years old. Laid hands over on him and said, "God, this is your word and I believe you." &gt;&gt; And I lay my hands upon him in commemoration of what you said. &gt;&gt; And got up and said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; And the father run around. We're talking about approach. &gt;&gt; We're talking about what you depend. Well, it depends ON WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. &gt;&gt; THIS IS JUST A MAN. And he's maybe just a farmer. His 15year-old boy there's DYING OF DTHERIA, BLACK DTHERIA. THE DOCTOR SAID YOU CAN'T GO IN. You didn't hear you heard the words of brother Brandham. Nothing spectacular about the prayer. &gt;&gt; And it really wasn't only in the prayer. It was that the what what the FATHER AND MOTHER THOUGHT ABOUT THE PRAYER. That's right. &gt;&gt; AND HE RAN AROUND the side and grabbed mother and kissed her and said, "Mother, isn't this wonderful?" &gt;&gt; The boy laying there dying, he said, "Mother, oh, it's so wonderful, honey, to think that the Lord has healed our boy." &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS. &gt;&gt; AM I GETTING IT ACROSS? THAT'S WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS. AND IT DEPENDED ON WHAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS. AND HE SAID CLEARLY, IF YOU THINK IT'S FROM GOD, YOUR REWARD WILL COME FROM GOD. IF YOU THINK IT'S JUST A FAKE OR THINK THAT JUST SOME PRAYER, THAT'S ALL YOU'LL GET. NOTHING. &gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T WE GET ANYTHING? BECAUSE IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT. HALLELUJAH. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And the little nurse said, "I believe, sir," when she saw him kiss his wife and said, "I believe, sir, you misunderstood what the doctor said." [snorts] Said, "Now, it's good to have faith, but how can he act like that and be so happy when your boy will be a a corpse in the next couple hours? That old saint wiped the tears from his eyes, put his hands over on the little nurse's shoulder, and said, "My dear loving child," said, "You're looking at the electric cardiogram because that's all you know to look at, &gt;&gt; but I'm looking to a divine promise &gt;&gt; that was made by God, &gt;&gt; and my boy lives." &gt;&gt; He said he's married and has a couple children now. I want to close. Just give me a couple more minutes, please. &gt;&gt; I want to close. We say it's the law. You can't You can't take that. It's the law. You can't drive that speed. It's the law. And then everpresent waters from the rock. He said when we die our souls will go under the altar of God where I was privileged to say a few mornings ago. This was 61. [snorts] I was probably with him the next month. It was June 61. I was with him either August or September. And I'm sorry. Yeah. again and our bodies shall return to the dust of the earth. But some someday &gt;&gt; where the scripture is fulfilled &gt;&gt; our spirits will be released from God will pick up the soul and the soul to the body and the power that'll raise us up is right in us. Now if you believe that when a person dies their body will go to dust. We believe that. But he same prophet said and that same power he said we and that power that'll raise us up is right in us now and we are now in heavenly places and we are now in the power of the resurrection. If there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters would create them a world out there out here and go and live a private life on it. You have the power in you to do it. If you've got a shadow of the power of God in you, you got the power to do it. God is omnipotent. &gt;&gt; See, he said, "What I mean, the power that's in you will make you could make a world into existence and go and live on it." And he says, "There you are." That power now that there's so much more in us than we realize. I can look at the body and say, "Well, you're getting weak. You're getting you're getting old. You're doing this or doing that." &gt;&gt; What he said, I believe that. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what power is in the church." Now, you have to stay with me now. Very close. But it's controlled by a law. &gt;&gt; The power's there, but it's controlled by a law. And that law is not keeping a bunch of commandments. &gt;&gt; That law is not saying your dress has to be so long and your hair has to be long and you have to be like like clean young men, young ladies and families. That's not what the law is. It's not doesn't happen like that. Those things we do because we love him. &gt;&gt; Those things we do is because that's what the word says. &gt;&gt; But the law, he said, it's a law of faith. And Jesus said, "Now listen," he was up to the he was talking to the people. He said, "Now I have a knife. It's in my pocket. At least I think it's in my pocket." He said, "If it's not there, it's on the dresser at home." But he says, "Faith will take that knife and put it in my pocket." He said, "You may NOT UNDERSTAND THAT SCIENTIFICALLY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, BUT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE TO them that believe." &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE LAW OF FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND APPROACH IS PART OF it and how how we approach it and WHAT WE THINK IT IS. &gt;&gt; NOW, some of you going to leave here and perhaps not get that, but that's WHAT IT IS. &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS are possible. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many heard the testimony of the two $50 bills in my pocket in Mexico? I was suffering terribly with my back. I'm going to be as quick as possible because I just want to end with two quotes. I was suffering terribly. This is only about three, four years ago. and uh and we we said we we went we hadn't gone to this place and I I really I'm not one to go to Mexico much. So anyway, we ended up down there. We're in a hotel and I laid for one week. I just laid for one week out on a a upper patio and tried to give chance for my back to heal. And I felt bad. My wife is sitting there, sitting there, sitting there. She's perfectly fine, but I'm lamed up. And so I felt I should take her maybe just down and see if she want to buy some things to take home before we go some to the kids. So I said, "Well, let's let's just go out." And I said, "I don't know how far I can walk, but we'll walk down the street." And I had taken four $450 US $50 bills, and they were brand new. They were crisp, real crisp. And I folded them up. I took two of them, $100, and I put them in my pocket. And I had some pesos and uh a few dollars. I don't know what, but I had those 250s and I thought in case she sees something. So, I went shopping and and I couldn't go very far. And I said, "Well, I I can't walk back, so let's take a taxi back." We took a taxi and I pulled into the hotel and I got a little bit nervous because, you know, I didn't want the taxi waiting and I'm and I'm floundering around my pants to get the money to pay those to pay him. And so I paid him the money and went upstairs and we were up just for a little while and felt, well, we better go down have a bite to eat. So I I reached into my pocket and those 50 two $50 bills aren't there. And so I started going around the seams of my pocket and I went into this pocket and I went into my back pockets and I went to everything and I began to think I'm not losing my mind. So I went to the little safe. I'm going to tell you this in detail. Went to the little safe, opened it up and took the $50 bills that were folded up. No, there's just two left. Now, I know I I clearly put it in my pocket in case my wife wanted to buy something. And I've I've done that all my life, and I always have some loose money in my pocket. And I started feeling real discouraged. I thought maybe I had different pair of pants on. So, I went to the I went to the closet and I thought maybe I had these pants on. So, I put my hand all in them. Nothing's there. No, I didn't have those on. No, I know I had these pants on and I go into I can't believe it. I just can't believe it. So I said to my wife, I've lost the $250 bill. So I've lost $100. Well, she said, "How did that happen?" I said, "Well, I don't know. I'm going to go down and go to the lost and found." I said, "Maybe when I was paying the taxi, maybe I maybe they're happy. Maybe the taxi driver is happy he's got a 100 US. Maybe it fell on the floor because I was in a hurry and trying to pay him. So I went downstairs and I went to the bail men. There was three of them. I said, "I lost $100, 250s. Do you have Have you seen it?" "No, they talked." "No, we haven't seen anything." And they were very nice. They said, "You should go to the lost and found." So I went to the front desk. "Have you found has any money been turned in?" Not that I thought it would get turned in. I just my heart I just thought it's gone. That's all. It's just gone. And I said, "Well, let's go and have a bite to eat." So, we went and had a bite to eat. And it was a downer. Not because it was $100 because h how how I lost it. I couldn't understand how I lost that. And I was just downer cuz I lost it. And we went up and went up to and went upstairs and I went to bed. And the morning when I woke up, uh, my wife wasn't in bed. So, well, so I I got up and I I took those pants that I had on and put them on. And I had just doing them up my pants. says, "All right." &gt;&gt; It just how simple. And my wife just walked out of the bathroom. And I and I had these jeans on. I just went like that and just I got my fingers just right here on the top and I felt some paper and I took a hold of it and it was a two $50 bills. I said, "Here's the two $50 bills." and she said, "I was listening to a message and Brother Ben talked about Brother Fred Sothman lost the keys to his car." So he said, "Well, let's pray." And other man, his his pickup was stolen. And the thing that stuck in my wife's mind was, "Let's pray." And the pickup was stolen. And Brother Brandham said, "Well, let's pray." So he says, "We got down and prayed." And so she said, I just went in the bathroom so I wouldn't trouble you and I just prayed that God would bring that $50 bills back and they're right at the top of my pocket and that's before God and I pulled them out and was showing them to her exactly the way they were. Now friends, that's not God of yesterday. &gt;&gt; That's not God of 100 years ago. That's God. And the prophet of God said, "If you could pray and believe it, &gt;&gt; and somehow she found favor with God and believed it and it ended up at the top of my pocket." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I either saved them or spent them. I don't know which. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Okay. I want to end with this. And brother John, you won't have to cut back tonight because in in expectation [snorts] and I'll just use this one now. Please, you young people just listen real close. You can understand this real good. And then I'm going to close. He said electricity will light up if if you work according to the law of electricity. He said you could have an artisian well on this time of on the side of the hill and thousands of gallons of water per minute to pour on this side of the hill. He said, "You could go and water the crop, it'll never do it. But if you work according to the way of gravitation and run that that water over on the hill, it'll water the crop. But you've got to work according to the law of gravitation." That's now we talk about the law of faith. Now we talk about the law of gravitation. Well, now he said, "If God is here, all in this building, if God is here, I'm saying if God is here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about back there. I'm reading a quote. But if God is here, &gt;&gt; here in this building right now. And he said, "Do you believe that?" Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "We're all conscious." He said, "We're all conscious that God is here. Now, the only thing that we can do, the only thing that we can do is to work according to the law of God for our healing." Now, he's talking about healing. What is the law? He said, for instance, and he talked about, he said, "We're on some dark mountain someplace here." And he says, "You know that electricity is all around you." And when I was reading this, when I underlined it, I was saying, "God is all around me. &gt;&gt; God is here." &gt;&gt; Don't weary, friends. I'm just going to end right away. He said, "You could scream till you got horse." &gt;&gt; And when I read that, &gt;&gt; I said, "I've seen some of our young people screaming till they got horse." Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "You could scream till you got horse and you CAN SAY, "OH, ELECTRICITY, ELECTRICITY." AND I'VE HEARD HIM SAY, "OH, GOD. OH, GOD. LIGHT UP AND SHOW ME HOW TO GET OUT of here. I KNOW YOU'RE HERE. I KNOW YOU'RE HERE. ELECTRICITY. IT'S SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN that you're here. I KNOW YOU'RE HERE. SO, YOU LIGHT UP. YOU SHOULD SCREAM." HE SAID, "YOU COULD scream till you got horse and it would never light up. You could scream for God and you could never sense him and never feel HIM AND NEVER GET YOUR ANSWER because God operates BY CERTAIN LAWS." YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE that law God is here. &gt;&gt; You have to believe and you have to depend on the divine gift that God sends. YOU GOT TO SAY, "GOD, I BELIEVE THAT IS YOUR PROPHET MESSENGER." &gt;&gt; AMEN. I believe in the ministry he has sent. &gt;&gt; I believe that when THE MAN OF GOD STANDS BEHIND THIS PULPIT, I'M GOING TO HEAR FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU THINK IT'S GOD, YOU'LL GET SOMETHING FROM GOD. IF YOU THINK IT'S JUST a a human up there SCREAMING AND YELLING, THEN THAT'S ALL YOU'LL GET. YOU CAN'T GET ANYTHING FROM THE HUMAN. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; BUT IF I CAN GET YOU TO AGREE, I'M GOING TO DEPEND ON THAT. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S FROM GOD. I BELIEVE THIS WORD IS FROM GOD. THEN you the words of your prayer will be answered. &gt;&gt; Am I making sense? &gt;&gt; He said, "But you've got to flow the laws according to the electricity." And he said, "God said, I'll send signs among you." Hello, friends. This is not a Sunday morning service. I'm not treating it like a Sunday morning service. I'm treating it like a last message I'd speak to you. You got real needs. I got real needs. We've prayed. We've asked God. We've cried. We've screamed. We've done all of these things. But I want I have to announce to you there is a law that it works by. &gt;&gt; And one of it is your approach. One of it is a reverence that you have towards it. You know, you you can take your choice. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't have much respect for that person." You won't get anything. &gt;&gt; Don't even listen to him then. Just forget it. &gt;&gt; But if you respect it, it's not the person. &gt;&gt; It is the gift that God sends. The divine gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And my my stress what God is dealing with me about. I can preach this because God is dealing with me about it. I You say, "Well, what are you what are you interested in, Brother Ed? I'm interested in the rapture." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm interested in a rapture. And this same prophet has SAID THERE'LL BE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE. THERE'LL BE PEOPLE PREACHING after the rapture's taken place. AND THE MORE I SEE AND THE MORE I hear, and when he starts talking about how few there is, how few there is, I SAY, "OH, GOD, LET ME BE ONE OF THOSE FEW. AND WHEN I SEE THESE THINGS THAT WE OUGHT TO BE SEEING, you've got things in your own home and your own family. You young people, you got things. And I'm telling you, brother Ed is telling you without any without any uh a shame or apology. The answer, the electricity IS HERE. I KNOW IT'S HERE. &gt;&gt; The law, THE THE LAW OF ELECTRICITY makes it light go on. AND I HAVE ABSOLUTE FAITH if I go and turn the switch it goes on or goes off. THERE'S NO QUESTION IF GOD who put electricity in the air. We can't scream it down. We can't yell it down. But we can use the law &gt;&gt; of electricity and you can receive it. THE LAW OF FAITH IS HERE. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go a step further. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF the devil. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HIM BAMBOOZLING a lot of people. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING ALL THE THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW, SATAN THIS AND SATAN THAT. WELL, LET'S GET RID OF HIM. &gt;&gt; AND WE COULD SCREAM AND YELL AND SAY, "I KNOW THE POWER'S HERE. I KNOW THE POWER'S HERE." YOUR PROPHET SAID, "YOU HAVE ENOUGH POWER IN YOU TO CREATE A WHOLE WORLD &gt;&gt; AND GO OUT AND LIVE ON IT, BUT YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT BY A LAW." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "HOW DO WE EXPECT TO HAVE A RAPTURE? WE HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH FAITH FOR HEALING. &gt;&gt; AND YET WE DO SEE WONDERFUL HEALINGS. [snorts] SAID, "You don't see him with your eyes. He's in another dimension." And I can prove that to you. There isn't anybody here. We're all wireless conscious. There's nobody here that'd be foolish enough to say, "I don't believe in the wireless. I don't believe in voices going through here." There's a way back there's way back in 1956 when I didn't have wireless. But we have a prophet connected to the author of science himself. &gt;&gt; And he says there's bodies going through the room. There's colors going through the room &gt;&gt; right now. That's not enough for me to say that to you. &gt;&gt; The answer to your prayer is going through the room. &gt;&gt; The answer to your cry is going through the room. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is. I don't care what it is. I don't care what it brings you. I don't care if it's a weight upon you. THE ANSWER TO BE FREE FROM THAT WEIGHT IS IN THE ROOM. IT'S IN THIS ROOM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And if I could get you to believe that, say, I'm going to respect that with all my soul and all my being. I'm going to respect that and honor that. You're on your way to get the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been very very clear and very plain and I hope you will forgive me for being as straightforward as I have been this morning. But I'll ask you to bow your heads. Oh father almighty one. Oh you have sent out your voice and that mighty voice. You've reached us Lord. Some that I'm speaking to. You reached them when they were very young. You begin to speak to them. Others, oh God, you have walked with them through their troubled days and through their good times. I pray you'll forgive us sometime, Lord. When we are going through our good times, we forget and we go on our merry little way and we don't give you the kind of honor, the kind of attention that we ought to. But I pray you'll forgive us for our our shortcomings. And above all things, I ask, oh Lord Jesus, stay with us. Walk with this people. Walk with them, oh God, in the midst of their in the midst of their need. I'm praying today, oh God, and I've been preaching because when uh when a prophet of God stood before a congregation of people, he was conscious of their needs. He was conscious of physical needs and spiritual needs. He was conscious of their needs and his heart went out to them. Lord, my heart goes out to the body of Christ, the bride of Jesus Christ, especially those that are here with us today. especially those that are under the sound of my voice. Oh God, I pray that you will come in a supernatural way and that we will hear the testimonies of what you have done and what you are doing amongst the people. I pray oh God that such joy will come through answered prayer and through the needs being uh met in the name of Jesus Christ. I ask it for your glory. Amen. [music] Uh, I want to sing. I'll have you stand with me if you would. Uh, whatever it takes. Whatever it takes to draw nearer to you, Lord. Um, [music] we can sing the chorus first. [snorts] You [music] know this chorus song to draw [music] closer to you, Lord. That's what I'll be willing [music and singing] to do for [singing] whatever it takes to be more like you.

Take sunshine for rain, [music] comfort for [singing] that's what [music] I'll be willing to do. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; And whatever [music] it takes for my will [singing] to break, that's [music] what I'll be willing to do. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we're here making this declaration in song. [music] Whatever it takes to be more like you. That's what we're willing to do, Lord. There may be someone here [music] in a state of deep, deep decision making and they need to make that a clear decision for you. I pray that you will not leave them. Lord, I prayed this morning. [music] I prayed for the your people praying oh God that there be a transforming power transforming power what you've already invested in your word you can change defeat into victory you can change bondage into deliverance that is all present with us here father I pray you'll bring it as a reality to the hearts [music] of each individual in Jesus name amen I want to say if you're here and you feel a need of prayer, I'm going to stay here and [music] pray with you if you feel that need. And I'd ask the rest of the congregation rather than shaking hands with one another when you [music] are when you're done, just the service is over. I've been a couple of hours and I don't make an apology for that, but we I just want to get this really off of my heart. So, God bless [music] you. I'd like you to just go real quietly and be back this evening. Brother John Anders [music] is going to preach. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Let's just sing that chorus again.
