[music] Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, Father, Lord, words cease what we feel and what we've been experiencing, Lord, and your spirit and your nearness and your closeness, Father. Lord, and what greater joy there is to a son and daughter of God, but to experience the manifestation of his word, Father. The manifestation of his word in his people, Lord. And Father, we just can't help but be joyous and overcome with all that you've done, Father. Lord, who can argue the testimony? Who can argue the life? Who can argue, Lord, the experience that we've seen, Father? And truly, whenever we talk about you, Lord, we can say and point to that and say, Lord, this is real. This is good, Father. Lord, we've come here and we can say, I'm glad when I've come to the house of the Lord to worship, Lord, not just to receive from you, but to give back and to give glory and to give testimony, Father. And so it's important for us Lord to not just ask always but to give back and give testimony for the great things you've done Lord the things not that you've done been doing and that you will do but Lord that you are doing right now Father Lord we've come here to you this morning Lord to hear from the word to hear what [music] you have to say to us Father for we know that it's a manifesting time and Lord we want to not just hear but manifest what we hear Lord these different needs the ones I've requested Father, how often we come and we ask, Lord, and maybe it's not as real to us because we're not going through that at that point in time, but Father, your word says we need to truly become under the burden for if one in the body suffered, Lord, we all suffered, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, may we just unite our hearts this morning for these ones, Lord, &gt;&gt; different ones that's not feeling well in the body. Maybe that for a coworker, Lord, there's needs in the body that we know that we've spoken about before. Lord, may you come and heal them this morning, Lord. May you just come and may we come under the burden of that, Father, that you may anoint our faith that we can believe for we know it's already been said and done, but Lord, we need to see it and we need to believe it, Lord. Not a mental belief, but a true belief, Father. Faith that is manifested that's that's real, Lord. And we just pray that we come into this morning uniting our hearts, believing for the different ones, Father. [music] We just so appreciate all that you do for us. Be with the man of God this morning. Lord, may you just come and speak to our hearts directly. &gt;&gt; Lord, may it find good ground to fall in. Lord, may we just &gt;&gt; take in what you've said to us. May it come right down to the soul. May it not just get stuck in the spirit or in the outer limits, but may it sink down right deep where we have need of it [music] and we can draw on it in future. Lord, help us and transform us, Father, into what you want us to be. &gt;&gt; Your bride that will spend eternity with you. Father, we just pray now, Lord, that you'll anoint this service. Be with your different ones, the musicians, the deacons, the speaker. Father, the audience, Lord, may we just hear what you have to say to us in Jesus Christ's precious name we ask it. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Why don't you greet one another before you have your seats? [music] I want to say, God bless you all. welcome you into the house of the Lord this morning. Any who may be visiting with us, just trust you'll feel welcome in the house of the Lord today. And those on the internet, we're thankful you can be a part of the service this morning. Want to say God bless you. Amen.

There are a few things on a table in the fellowship room left behind from winter camp. If you're missing something and it's not there, please get in touch with Sister Star Caldwell.

If I can look back to see all my works, all I've done, Lord, [music] all I've done. I wonder if [music] I live my life for you. I wonder if [music] I did [singing] the best I could. I wonder if [music] my works will please you, Lord. [singing] All I've done, [music] Lord. All I've done. When I can [singing] see my ups and [music] downs, the mistakes I made in [music] this journey. And when [music] this life will be over [singing] with [music] all I've done, [singing] Lord, all I've done. I wonder if I [music and singing] live my life for you.

Thank you, brother Daniel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Daniel, do you have work yet? Did you find a job just about 3 weeks ago or so, brother Daniel lost his work? Lost his job. And but you know what? I appreciate a congregation doesn't hardly know and they just keep coming to church and driving this distance from Seattle and are faithful and and uh so we just if you didn't we were going to pray that you would find find one. Amen. [clears throat] Good to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Good to hear all the things that are taking place amongst us and elsewhere as well. But before we uh uh I have a few things that I want to mention before we go further in the in the uh service. I just want to show our sincere appreciation for everyone that uh has been assisting at the camp. Uh for brother Derek and sister Debbie. Uh it's really been wonderful. and for those that have volunteered here and assisted brother uh brother Kim and all the people who have been working on the school building and the sisters that came and have made uh lunch and I think that's probably going to have to even go beyond being uh volunteer probably somebody's going to have to take some responsibility even for part of the time because the brothers are coming on a regular basis and uh and Some are spending time during the day, but on Saturdays when they do call and and it just those are not uh not every Saturday, but uh uh those announcement will be made and I think they'd called for about 20 or 25, but I think there's about 40 that showed up yesterday throughout the day. Uh and a lot of work was done. Just a lot of work was done. Uh, I can't go into that building without thinking of those that if the Lord Jesus carries that are going to be raised up in the atmosphere that I know will prevail there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you something, friends. There's people there that don't have children. There's people there who whose children are grown up and gone. But for myself all I see is it's a blessed place for the believers children and and more than that uh they talk about certain areas that you know this fellowship room that we have here isn't sufficient for us anymore and what they call a gymnasium over there that's going to be a I hope everybody understands that as far as I'm concerned that'll be a fellowship room over there as well that will provide the needs of the of the congregation. But um some time ago uh I mentioned probably just before we took vacation I mentioned something uh concerning the the desire and the burden that I have and I I'm a little bit conscious because I know we're going on internet and so on but I mentioned about uh uh online uh streaming of the of the classrooms and it's more than I mean brother Dingwall and others took took a hold of the idea and it is it is in not only possible but I'm sure that you're going to see it and uh uh there's all kinds of people for example there are people who homeschool what what what caused me to think about this was some children that we have that are part of this congregation and families which are on the US side some of them perhaps a little too far some of them are not able to bring the children across for one reason or another but they would be able to uh stream online and s actually have it right be physically a part of what's going on in the classroom. And then there may be days that there [clears throat] would be a some kind of a a tour or an outing or something else and they'd be able to come across and become a part of that. So they would also have that physical interaction. Then there are those that are further away. And I know that there are just you just take my word for it. There are hundreds. &gt;&gt; There are hundreds of there's there's hundreds of believers that may be even up into the thousands. Some mothers are teaching their children, but they don't feel qualified and perhaps are not qualified. There are others who perhaps are qualified, but they're too busy. They're maybe occupied and they're maybe have small children, whatever more. And and so for one reason or another, but I can tell you that there are believers everywhere that are adamant, simply cannot uh give themselves over to send their children. Now, some areas may be different than others, but but as far as the public system is concerned, I can tell you that it's for the most part corrupt. And some that are even Christian in that sense of the word but are are in the public domain. They have children coming. There are people who have troubled children and we have found that even here that or there were Christian schools but people who had troubled children were sending them to those schools because they felt they needed a a stricter environment. So whatever it might be, that's not, you know, that's not our affairs. But I got a letter from a brother and the brother's perhaps streaming right now from the Eastern United States. I do not know the brother. He just wrote it in handwriting on a page. And he said he had heard the comment about the school. He said, and I think they've been homeschooling their children. He said, "I we have seven children." And he says, "That so touched my heart to think that you have a burden for the children." And he said, "Uh uh" and he sent a check for $500 for the school and for the internet that that might go forward. And he said it, and he closed off in the letter, he said, "Please pray for us." He said, "We're in we're in dire financial straits." And I just I felt so humbled reading that letter. Here's a brother in dire financial straits, has a family of seven children, that's nine in a family, and sent this school and church $500 to help out with that that because he caught a hold of that vision. I'd like the congregation to be able to say, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's a real sacrifice. And I pray that God will bless the brother and will bring him out of his financial straits. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I believe it's going to be a blessing. That's that's just personally my vision and I believe that's going to be so. And I could say some other things. I can tell you that there are those that are even in other countries in China being one of them, Africa being another where there the time zone is completely different. But they would be able to archive and some of those countries in China for example English is their second language that they that they require or that is available to the people and they love death they love eager they're eager to learn English and if they could if they if the Christians and the new believers that are coming there would be able to tap into the online English uh teaching and and under the opaces of this message I don't think we should belittle that friends that's a very great thing and and I I know that when we were printing the message books the people just they were so eager to get them because they had the Chinese on one side and the and the English on the other I'm really uh so taken with the thing that's been that is taking place not only since the camp before the camp months months for the camp. We don't want to just think camp camp because uh we don't want the people of the church or the people on the internet to think, well, we're just, you know, just there's a a youth movement, but it's a that's God's movement. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what we're we're interested in. I want to mention that we Lord willing [clears throat] uh just before I took vacation we got notice that they had found a location uh the brothers who've been seeking to arrange meetings in Switzerland and they found a location uh for meetings. So we Lord willing we will be go moving forward with these services u June the 2nd to June the 5th. Now we don't have the v holiday here that they have over there. They have they hold Easter which we do. Then they have Pentecost which is a big it's a big uh holiday in Europe and that is 50 days after Easter which was re they're celebrating Pentecost. And then they celebrate the next weekend which is the ascension weekend when Jesus ascended. That's the way that they have it. And uh so anyway, these meetings are going to be on June the 2nd to June the 5th. Uh and the announcement there is on the board. Um uh I of course will be going, the Lord willing, but brother Ron Spencer is going to be uh speaking as well. And brother Murphy will be going because there are other churches in Europe that uh have asked brother Murphy to be there. in fact is he will be just out of Crayfeld uh with brother Pankanen on Easter and they have uh uh they've they feel quite close to the work. So I'd like you to be praying especially for these meetings. The two pastors that are uh uh local pastors that are there, brother Franis Alipakar who ministered here. He has a church perhaps no more than an hour, hour and a half from where these meetings are. And so I would say to any that are in that area of the of the world and you're streaming these meetings, uh there's brother France Alipakar and also brother uh Jeanjac Michel and and they have he has a church I think maybe about an hour the other direction. So people who are interested in hearing [clears throat] more about the message, they can get in touch with these brothers. Uh [clears throat] I I may not have all of the details, but and quite a few people here have heard about what's been going on here, the people going out on the streets and uh witnessing and handing out books. And brother Toby was in contact with his father, brother Caumb in Congo. And uh he he he just said, "This congregation, this is what we need to do." And they went out on the streets and uh uh people came into the church and they baptized 27 people. And uh after that uh I think it was after that anyway one of the services uh brother Caumbi was speaking to brother Toby and he said he he got up to preach and he preached for about 15 minutes and the Holy Spirit just took over the service &gt;&gt; and that was uh that was the end of his preaching. Not that we want that every time but I mean that that's just wonderful. And uh similar to what happened out of the camp, brother uh brother Diggs, he preached this meeting, but and then the service uh kind of went out of human control. And that's good. &gt;&gt; We we are we're not just interested in I want to speak about this in a little bit, but we're not interested in just uh uh uh something of that nature. That's not what we're seeking. But we believe that that is an end. That's something that's sovereign. And that's something that God does. And then brother Kyle is telling me Friday night, this last Friday night, he said it was just a a a roar of prayer and no no one single voice, just everyone praying and praying for different burdens. And there's about 75 people packed in the fellow in the chapel. I I think that that is going to the prayer meeting is going to probably have to move in the future when we can to the fellowship room because it's packed right out. And I say praise be to God. &gt;&gt; And uh uh it it it's wonderful when a prayer meeting gets to the place where people want to come. &gt;&gt; When it gets to the place where if you're not there, you feel you might be missing something. &gt;&gt; That's really wonderful. And I want to thank you, brother Matthew, and sister Rhonda Redell for all of the effort and all of the uh delegation that you have done and the diligence that you have done and and so much of this has has had its beginnings uh with the people and the young people and not only young others as well. I saw brother Larry musician out there on the street in a picture and I God bless the people that uh that pray. God bless the people that give. God bless the people that work. God bless the people that are the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We all are a part. And you don't know whether it's just a handshake or an encouragement or a word or an email or a telephone call or whatever it is. But what I say to you is is keep it up. &gt;&gt; Keep moving in that direction because this is only this is only a means to an end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh [clears throat] then in China, we got a phone call last week and we we we heard of uh brother David that went to a city and uh he just took a little pullpit and set it on the sidewalk and uh started to speak. &gt;&gt; But the thing was &gt;&gt; he he Th this uh brother Ivan, you come up here, would you just tell them how possible this is in China? It's better coming from you. I think you took the phone call, didn't you? Did you take the phone call from Brother David? Just come up here. Did you take the phone call? &gt;&gt; I got an email. &gt;&gt; You got an email? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And how possible is this to happen in China? &gt;&gt; Impossible. &gt;&gt; Impossible. There you have it. That's why I want him to say it. &gt;&gt; It's it it's just um it's just like the Bible time when you go into a Greek such a country, they fellowshipping they worshiping the hidden god. They're very superstitious. &gt;&gt; And they are the government is is uh is very bound. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then you go on the street on the Greek like Paul did and uh preach the gospel. It's I think it's as hard as that. &gt;&gt; Yes. And then and then brother David who's speaking here speaks a different dialect than the people who are there. And so a woman stepped up and she started interpreting for him. &gt;&gt; And then that gathered a bigger crowd. &gt;&gt; And after they were done with that, they baptized nine or 10 people. &gt;&gt; And it it [applause] the street can't handle any traffic. The cars are parked up on the side. How How do you think that car is going to move? The whole street is full of people. And then they baptized this woman here, baptized this person here, and there's the group that was baptized. &gt;&gt; Praise God. [applause] Hallelujah. [applause] So, so it's not just Mount Baker camp. It's not just what happened Saturday. It's not just a prayer meeting here. It's in Congo. It's in China. And you can be sure it's happening in many other places. And we say praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. [applause] God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; So I thought we need to know &gt;&gt; these things the Bible said were noised abroad. &gt;&gt; Noised &gt;&gt; abroad. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful, brother Ernie? Praise God. It just makes a person feel so overcome by it. Amen. Well, would you like to stand and we're going to read some scripture. Pray for my voice. Tell you what, I rebuked the devil for all I was worth in the study there. Amen. Let's just thank the Lord, shall we? Almighty God, we are we're filled, our hearts are filled with praise and thanksgiving. And we're here today, oh God, to give glory to you. We're here today to take another further step. &gt;&gt; We're here today to announce to you, oh Lord, that here we are. Here we are in your presence. &gt;&gt; Here we are to be whatever you would have us to be. Here we are, oh God, to make ourselves available. &gt;&gt; Here we are to sanctify ourselves. &gt;&gt; Here we are to sanctify ourselves and surrender. &gt;&gt; Surrender to the Holy Spirit. Oh, Holy Spirit, I pray that you'll move throughout the influence of this service, wherever it might be, in whatever rooms where the sisters are in the in with the children, Lord, and the babes and and Lord, the the deacons and all that may be around the building and then the congregation here in the in the sanctuary. Come, oh, Holy Spirit, come mightily. reach out into the internet land, Lord, wherever the people may be gathered, one or two or groups that might be here or there, and wherever this service may be heard, I pray that it'll be a foundation stone. Oh God, I pray, Father, that you will you'll accomplish what you have desired to accomplish in the name of Jesus Christ. Anoint us now, Father, both speaker and hearers for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll have you turn to u to the Gospel of uh Matthew, Matthew's Gospel. And while you're standing and you have your Bibles open ready to read, I want to I want to draw your attention to uh two or three quotes first because uh because of what I see God doing amongst us, I want to tell the congregation while I was away, we a wife and I took three weeks, but I just had such a craving and such a hunger in my heart for the congregation, not not merely young people, but for the congregation that we might experience all that God has for us. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be short changed. &gt;&gt; We don't want to see us just carry on with unanswered prayers when they can be answered. &gt;&gt; We don't want to carry on just with the cool embers if we can have a blazing fire. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Amen. We don't want to just carry on as a prophet of God called I don't want to be identified as a powerless church. &gt;&gt; And he says a church that doesn't have the supernatural is a powerless church. &gt;&gt; I say God save us from a powerless church. &gt;&gt; We don't want a social club. &gt;&gt; We don't want a lodge. &gt;&gt; We want the church of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The book of Acts church. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to say to you while we are just uh coming to the opening of the service that you'll have patience with me. I because I want to take sufficient time. But at the same time I want to I want to be very careful that you understand anything I say today is not intended to be a negative or a downer but it is to tell you that the book of acts the upper room &gt;&gt; that was only to prepare the people for the book of acts &gt;&gt; they didn't have a upper room every weekend &gt;&gt; but they had an upper room and that conditioned the people and filled them with the holy Holy Spirit matured them as men so that once they had the upper room, it wasn't an upper room and then a downer room the next week. No, it was an upper room and then they went on from there. &gt;&gt; And that's what God intends. &gt;&gt; Just think because of an upper room or because of a Holy Spirit being filling the people. What a glorious victory it is for the bride of Jesus Christ. If out from that comes a crop that cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose. &gt;&gt; That's the whole intent. &gt;&gt; And so we have here a a a quote I'd like to have you read with me. Now remember this. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could read that together. Christ. Now remember this. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come [clears throat] into the church and defile it, making it lukewarm, formal, and powerless. &gt;&gt; It exposes Satan. and revelation has exposed him, &gt;&gt; revealing his works, attempted destruction of God's people, and the discrediting of God's word, right down to the time that he is cast into the lake of fire, and we're to continue on in our direction until he's cast into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; I want to have a ringside seat. &gt;&gt; I want to see that creature annihilated. &gt;&gt; He fights that. He cannot stand it. He cannot stand what's happening. &gt;&gt; He fights what's happening &gt;&gt; and he does everything he can to to discredit it. He knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church &gt;&gt; and what she is, &gt;&gt; what she stands for and that she can and that she can do the greater works, &gt;&gt; she will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who could cease or who could hinder the book of Acts from coming about? The book of Acts was assertain because it had to be part of the scripture. &gt;&gt; And so the people who fulfilled it had to be there &gt;&gt; at that season and surrender themselves &gt;&gt; to that degree. &gt;&gt; Brother Richard Drake, you said a mouthful the other day here at the pullpit when the Wednesday night when the young people were giving their testimony. He said what happened at the camp happened because the young people became surrendered &gt;&gt; and it will only continue as they continue to surrender something on that basis and I just said God bless you brother Richard that's exactly my theme. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be an invincible army. He said if they get a true revelation of the true spirits within the framework of the Christian church &gt;&gt; and by God's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan will be powerless before her. That is thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Satan will be powerless &gt;&gt; before her. &gt;&gt; He will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert. Yes, Satan hates revelation, but we love it. &gt;&gt; With true revelation in our lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail against us, but we will prevail over him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, as we just lead to the service, Brother Brandon said in the message, "Why are people so tossed about?" He said, "One of my favorite messages." But he said, "There's two different phases of the same Christianity." &gt;&gt; And one of them is an intellectual or mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge. And the other is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart. &gt;&gt; The one intellectually is is a hungering. &gt;&gt; He's he's he's feasting on God, but his feast doesn't hold out. &gt;&gt; Now, this is written so that you know that what you have received does hold out. &gt;&gt; It may not be at the same level all the time. It may not be at the same euphoric atmosphere all the time, but it's the same God. And I want to speak on this from the scripture. &gt;&gt; I want you to nail it down. Want you to remember this service and remember the scriptures. I have quite a few of them. &gt;&gt; He said, "And the one seems to have victory all the time. There's nothing bothers them. And under that nothing, I'll say no friendships, no troubles, no financial difficulties, no sickness, no nothing, nothing can bothers them. &gt;&gt; They're just as solid and anchored as they can be. No trials, no storms bother them at all. &gt;&gt; We all have trials. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if the trial is bothering us, I want to announce to you there's a place &gt;&gt; in Christ &gt;&gt; where it will not bother you. &gt;&gt; But they seem to have something. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have something about them that people who are Christians and are trying to live for God admire that type of Christian. That's the two phases of the two types. And I've often wondered, think of that, the prophet often wondered, Lord, what is it that these people have that others crave for so much and yet seem to fail to get it? All right. Now, we're going to read. I want to read from Matthew the 6th, the 11th chapter, and starting with verse two. Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, and he said unto him, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go [clears throat] and show John again those things which you do hear and see. The blind receive their sight &gt;&gt; and the lame walk. The lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear. &gt;&gt; The dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them. &gt;&gt; Verse six. And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me. Brother Brandham preached one service only once and it was entitled the forgotten biatitude. &gt;&gt; And I am calling this service this morning the forgotten biatitude rediscovered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. rediscovered because a prophet discovered it &gt;&gt; and he said, "Now the biatitudes in Matthew 5, blessed are the poor and blessed are the uh poor in spirit. Uh blessed are the they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inhabit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness. Blessed are the merciful, and blessed are the pure in heart. Blessed are the peacemakers, and blessed are they that are which are persecuted for righteousness sake. And blessed are ye when men revile you and persecute you. And those are all of the biatitudes. And he says that was in Matthew 4, the sermon on the mount. But he says then then over here in Matthew 11, he inserts this forgotten beatitude. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. John the Baptist had a very brief ministry of actual ministering time. Brother Brandham actually said it was just a few months and he was thrown in prison. We don't know exactly how long and that's not relevant at this time. But he had a he had a ministry that burst on the horizon and on the in the country of Palestine, little small country and he introduced the Messiah. He was a great prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus gave him the highest commendation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he was no man born of a woman greater than John the Baptist. He said because the other prophets prophesied but he introduced who they prophesied about. &gt;&gt; They prophesied of Christ but he introduced the Christ. And I just want to uh say a little bit briefly so you can because I I I [clears throat] I want to I don't want to drag this part out but a a bit of his first ministry. He preached with such boldness and his experience was in a in such a short period of time here. just come with such a force and such a burning in his bones. And he says, "And now the axe is laid under the root of the trees. And every tree that bringeth forth not fruit is hewing down and cast into the fire. And the people asked him, "What shall we do?" Notice this is a position he has. Now the people are asking him, "What shall we do?" And he answered unto them, and he that has two coats, and so on, he let him impart uh let him impart to him that hath none. And then then cometh the publicans to be baptized, and and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? And they and he said unto them, exact no more than that which is appointed to you. And the soldiers likewise, now the armies coming to him, and saying, and what shall we do? And he tells them and said to them, "Do no violence to no man, and neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages." And the people were in expectation, and all the people mused in their heart in in their heart of John, whether he were the Christ or not. Think of think of the ministry. &gt;&gt; Is this the Messiah? &gt;&gt; John was so bold to declare in another place in the scripture. And John bare witness of him, of Christ, and cried, saying, This is he of whom I spake. &gt;&gt; He cometh, he that cometh after me is preferred before me. He was before me, and of his fullness have we all received grace for grace. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. And he said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Make straight the way of the Lord. And as said the prophet Isaiah. And John answered them. They asked him if he was the Christ. And he said, I baptized you with water, but there standeth one among you whom you know not. He it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoe latched I'm not worthy to unloose. And these things were were done in Barb Beth Bara uh beyond Jordan where John was baptizing. And the next day, John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and he said, "Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world, &gt;&gt; this is he &gt;&gt; of whom I said that comes after me, which is preferred before me." It says, "And I knew him not, but he that he he that but he that uh but he but that he should be manifest to Israel. Therefore, I came baptizing with water, and John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him, and I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water, is the same that said unto me unto uh upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he which baptize with the Holy Ghost. Listen to his sermon. Listen to his declaration. I saw it. I saw it descending. He spoke to me and told me on whom I saw it descending. This is he and he will baptize with the Holy Ghost. He says, "And I saw and I bear witness and I bear record that this is the son of God." Amen. &gt;&gt; And again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, "Behold the lamb of God." &gt;&gt; In just a short time, &gt;&gt; no soldiers are saying, "And what shall we do?" &gt;&gt; In fact, his soldiers are taking him to prison. No publicans are coming and saying, "What shall we do?" &gt;&gt; All the honor is gone. &gt;&gt; The big meetings have ceased. &gt;&gt; The people have fled. &gt;&gt; And he's come under accusation. &gt;&gt; And he's now he's being in prison and the conditions have reversed. says to two of his faithful disciples, go and ask him if he really is the one &gt;&gt; or do we look for another &gt;&gt; after the reality. &gt;&gt; I will say that the scriptures of the of his bold statements, I met the Christ. This message is Christ. &gt;&gt; There is nothing like this. But there might come a time when you find yourself in prison. &gt;&gt; This is not for a whole congregation, but I'm preaching it to the whole congregation because we as individuals, we encounter it. We find ourselves imprisoned by circumstance. And I want to detail these things. We find ourselves. Let me say something. John never became less than John. Amen. &gt;&gt; While he was saying, "Behold the lamb of God." He was John. And when he was in prison saying, "See if it's him." He's still John. &gt;&gt; He was a prophet before and he's a prophet there. &gt;&gt; Brother Phantom said the prophets are neurotics. They get so high in the inspiration. &gt;&gt; Then they come down out of the inspiration &gt;&gt; and they they they have a completely different mental process happening because they feel, you know, the inspiration is gone. You have a Saturday night at camp or you have a prayer meeting here in the church or or you have a service here and it's it's such an inspiration. &gt;&gt; The inspiration can depart. and and circumstances can come against you &gt;&gt; and trials and Satan can come with all his forces against you and you just wonder is there any way out? &gt;&gt; How can I get out of this? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus said, "And blessed is he who's not offended in me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John had been filled with the baptism of the Holy Spirit when he was still a uh in his mother's womb. &gt;&gt; He had experienced some of these dramatic events which we've just spoken of a wee bit. &gt;&gt; And his ministry was with such power that the multitudes were literally attracted to him. The Bible says that all of Judea and all the region around about Jordan, mobs just came. &gt;&gt; We just saw a picture and and uh and brother David has a a street full of people, but he was moving a whole nation. &gt;&gt; Imagine how he felt &gt;&gt; and what a reality. This is it. &gt;&gt; I felt it. I I had such an inspiration. I was drunk on the spirit. Think of the people in the upper room. They came out of the upper room totally drunk on the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; But it was for a purpose. &gt;&gt; It was for a greater work. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; they didn't have that every Sunday or every Sabbath day. &gt;&gt; And then the adversity set up. The Bible even says of Jesus, "And when John had heard in the prison of the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples and said go and ask him." And uh he said Jesus said the blind tell him he went. Now what he did? Watch it closely. Jesus went back to his vindication. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He went back to the beginnings. &gt;&gt; He went back to the proof of the ministry. &gt;&gt; Said, tell them the lame &gt;&gt; are healed &gt;&gt; and the blind receive their sight and the lame walk &gt;&gt; and lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear. And now 2,000 years after this was written [clears throat] comes an end time messenger preaching in Chicago and he preaches the forgotten. Here's the forgotten beatitude and blessed are is he who's not offended in me. It wasn't that John was offended in Christ but the offense is has a different meaning which I will relate to you. It's it's as though a stumbling block or an impediment, something comes into your life that's an impediment to what God is doing. &gt;&gt; It it could be something that would cause a person to begin to distrust or to desert one to desert one whom he ought to trust and obey. John was now reassessing. He was re-evaluating what had happened. &gt;&gt; Is it all really is it is it really that true? &gt;&gt; I I made all these declarations, but it seemed as though that the the uh trouble that had come upon him. &gt;&gt; Was now draining that out of him. &gt;&gt; And you know what I'm talking about. You've all been there because you've been up on the mountain heights and then you get down so low and say, "Is it real?" I know what I re I I was while I was studying this service, I remember seeing a young man. He's not here today. He's not even serving God today, but he said here at the when the young people were giving testimony such as they did Wednesday, he stood right here. He said, "You know, I often, you know, I desired to be filled with the Holy Spirit." And he said, "And I thought I had the baptism of the Holy Spirit." But he says, "Now I know I have the baptism of the Holy Spirit." Well, unfortunately, he's not here. He need to hear this service. &gt;&gt; I hope he does hear it. &gt;&gt; I don't know what God did, but all I'm saying to you is that that great moment of inspiration, excitement, don't count on that moment. That moment is only there to carry you to a greater work. &gt;&gt; The greater work is to be able to come into a prison and not allow the prison to break you down. [applause] &gt;&gt; Here's a shocker for you. Brother Brandham says Jesus did not give him a book of rules &gt;&gt; on how to be patient in prison. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't even deliver him from prison. &gt;&gt; He gave him he sent and and and what he did was confirm &gt;&gt; that the call that he had and the one that called him is the same. It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; He's the same. are inside the prison as he is outside of the prison. The power of the Holy Spirit can help you to live in prison. &gt;&gt; Jesus never delivered him from prison. &gt;&gt; Never took him out. He died there. &gt;&gt; But he died in victory. [applause] &gt;&gt; That is the greater work. It needed to be in the Bible that he was beheaded. &gt;&gt; It needed to be in the word of God. &gt;&gt; And he remained faithful till they took his head off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he never lost his faith &gt;&gt; that this is the Messiah. &gt;&gt; I don't care what happens. I don't care what people do. I can say one thing. This is this ministry and this message came by Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Satan and God will even allow Satan to bring things your way &gt;&gt; and into your life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whether by friends or by family or by this or by that or by circumstances or by job or by education or by pleasure or whatever more. He'll try to bring things your way. &gt;&gt; If he thinks that success will take you, he'll he'll bring you success. If he thinks that poverty will bring it, he'll bring you poverty. But God can bring you through success. He can bring you through poverty. He can bring you He can bring you to be uh steadfast amongst the people. He can bring you to be steadfast alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with, you know, having a big comm camaraderie and all of that. It's wonderful, but we there are times when you don't have it. And you have to stand alone. &gt;&gt; I talked to a man this last week and he's facing some real issues. He's not part of this church. We had prayer with him and I said to him, he knows about the message. He has family in this church. And I just related my own testimony. And I told him, I said, "I've stood where you are. I've been there." And after we had prayer, I spent about an hour, hour and a half with them. I said, "There's you know what you need to do? You need to jump off the cliff. &gt;&gt; You need to be prepared to separate from all other relationships. &gt;&gt; This is not between you and your family and God. This is not between you and your friends and God. This is between you and God. &gt;&gt; And when God speaks, you jump off the cliff. I'm not doing I'm not doing this for anyone else. &gt;&gt; And blessed is he whosoever &gt;&gt; is not offended in me. &gt;&gt; So the offense was was the things that did not turn out right for John. &gt;&gt; That was the offense. And brother Brandham says, and I'm going to uh go to what he said specifically in the forgotten biatitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "But when trouble set in, &gt;&gt; there isn't a man or woman or young person here, but what either has or is experiencing or will experience. I'm not taking away anything from what God has done for you, &gt;&gt; but what I'm doing as a watchman saying down the road, I may be able to see a little further than some of the young people or the or or others, but that's that's my position. That's my office to look down the road &gt;&gt; when trouble does come. &gt;&gt; Because trouble does set in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And these are troublesome times. And when trouble does set in, he said Jesus came and showed Jesus came and showed the Messiah that he was the Messiah. John saw that. John heard that. He says, "But then something went wrong." Brother Bham says something went wrong. &gt;&gt; What you when I what I'm preaching here now today is when something goes wrong, &gt;&gt; at least you think it's gone wrong. Come on. &gt;&gt; It may not be wrong. It might be right. Who Who says it's wrong? &gt;&gt; As brother Tom preached. Who says it's bad? &gt;&gt; Who says it's bad? &gt;&gt; Who says it's wrong? &gt;&gt; John thought it was wrong? &gt;&gt; And that that allowed that made way for the offense. not offended in the sense that we think of being offended, but in in the an offense in the in the way that it became like a a stumbling block to him. Something's gone wrong. &gt;&gt; He said John had introduced the Messiah &gt;&gt; with a fan in his hand and going to burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. But he found out and he found out the works of Jesus. He was meek &gt;&gt; and he was lowly &gt;&gt; and so it wearied him. &gt;&gt; In other words, we get out boldly. We may go out on the streets and we may speak to our family and you've preached to your relatives and to your friends. You said, "This is it. Hallelujah." And you're just you're so bold with it. And I was at a meeting. I was in a prayer meeting. I was in our church. Oh, you should have heard it. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like this message. And then things come against you and come against you and this. And it's not, you know, a jail hasn't got one bar. It's got one after the other &gt;&gt; and you find yourself completely enclosed. And then you begin to wonder &gt;&gt; if what you declared &gt;&gt; with such power &gt;&gt; and that this this word is the answer &gt;&gt; and there's no message like it. Then you begin to wonder where is the power? It seems so weak and seems so lowly and it seems so, you know, like it hasn't got the strength I declared it did have. &gt;&gt; And that allows for it starting to be a stumbling block to you. &gt;&gt; Reach it. Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And then Satan has all kinds of other things to throw out as an attraction and a person becomes, as someone preached here not long ago, distracted. &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe it's so maybe it's here. Well, or maybe just become wearied. As he said, he got wearied &gt;&gt; and he was so weak and lowly that it wearied him. He didn't know what to say [clears throat] and he thought here's a prophet. Think of it now. Elijah here talking about Elijah there. &gt;&gt; That nice, brother Kyle. &gt;&gt; I guess Elijah, the spirit of Elijah knows what Elijah went through. &gt;&gt; The second this Elijah speaking about that Elijah And he said, and he thought, now there's something that's gone wrong somewhere. It seemed that he believed the wrong thing. It seemed like he wasn't working right. And there's many times, how many times? Many times, &gt;&gt; say it. many times &gt;&gt; that we think it too. &gt;&gt; I see it smiling. &gt;&gt; He says we think it too that it isn't working right. I'm glad I can say a prophet spoke thus sayeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; but it's working right. as long as we know that he's here. &gt;&gt; What difference does it make? Whether you're in difficult times, whether things are going backwards, &gt;&gt; whether it be sickness or finances or whatever more, &gt;&gt; it's working right, as long as you know that he's here. &gt;&gt; As long as you know this is the word. &gt;&gt; This is the message. &gt;&gt; And if I say this isn't the message, tell me where it is. &gt;&gt; Tell me where it is. Tell me where there's a message that has revealed &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; with such clarity. &gt;&gt; You can't find it anywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As long as we know that he's here, what difference does it make? It's working right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe it ain't working according to the way we think it ought to work, &gt;&gt; but it's working according to the way God wants it to work. &gt;&gt; Agree with that, please. &gt;&gt; It's working the way God wants it to work. repair. He said, "John thought, well now I introduced a Messiah that had a fan in his hand and he's going to purge the floors and take his wheat into the garner." And I told him the axe was laid to the root of the tree and he's going to take all the trash and burn it up. &gt;&gt; And here it is. Instead of a great mighty man like that, here he comes, meek and lowly. Something must have went wrong somewhere. You see &gt;&gt; the future &gt;&gt; from what he expected &gt;&gt; and what he had declared &gt;&gt; but it wasn't wrong. It was only wrong in his own thinking because he had a certain expectation &gt;&gt; and it wasn't happening according to his expectation. Let let's leave our expectation in the hands of God. Whether I'm healthy or sick, whether I live or die, whether I'm out of prison or in prison, I know one thing. &gt;&gt; Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ is here. And don't ever be moved from that one truth. &gt;&gt; Christ, I have Christ. &gt;&gt; I have a message that came that was confirmed &gt;&gt; by the Almighty God. I had a message that I have a message I was birthed &gt;&gt; into a message that God thought so much of he wouldn't leave it for one single moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The message you believe almighty God creator of heavens and earth. He would not leave this word. &gt;&gt; Why should we leave it? You can't find a single time. &gt;&gt; And I would encourage you to take what got me in into this channel. I was I was just hungering. I've seen supernatural things. I just thought, you know, we must have that. &gt;&gt; And so I I thought I'm going to listen to a series of services. And I knew that I was with uh brother Brandham in May of 1961. So I thought, well, I'll just go back maybe a month prior to that. And there was a series in Chicago. And it starts out with uh I think Micaiah the prophet, then only believe and uh uh about three or four services. And then the next service ends up in Grand Prairie when I was there and had set up that meeting for him. And then he went from Grand Prairie, we went to Dawson Creek, but he laid it out. It wasn't exactly what many of the ministers perhaps wanted to hear, but in one of the services especially is really remarkable. And then they've forgotten biatitude is is one that's squeezed in there and only believe. And they are ultra simplistic in one way. And he just said he described what Jesus was. And he said, "Now, wouldn't it be reasonable if we if we found out what he was and if we do believe that he's the same yesterday and today and forever?" He said if we found that he did the same things today, if we if we say that he's here, then he should do the same things. &gt;&gt; Now friends, we can rejoice in that. And we can also be convicted by that. I was convicted. I say, I don't see all the same things. I don't see the number. I've seen supernatural things, but I am not satisfied. &gt;&gt; I want to see more. And if we're not seeing it, I want to know why we're not seeing it. And if there's anything that we have to do, that I have to do that we as a church have to do. And then then to hear that God begins to break upon the young people. I say, God bless you young people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Stay consecrated. &gt;&gt; Stay fervent. &gt;&gt; And you'll show others the way. &gt;&gt; I'm challenging you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I can't get it, you'll get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Show us the way. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm laying out a challenge to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you were so moved with brother Dig's service and show us the way. &gt;&gt; Continue on. &gt;&gt; I'm still here. Trouble came my way. Trouble set in. But I'm still here. Satan threw everything at me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He gave me the greatest opportunity, but I saw it was going to take me away from God. I denied it because he's still here. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Satan wanted me to sell my gift. want to sell my testimony, but I denied him by the power of the Holy Spirit. And I'm still here. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's what God wants &gt;&gt; to me. That's the greater works. When you can go through a long, dark, [screaming] hard spell &gt;&gt; and come out the other end of the tunnel and say, "Brother Ed, &gt;&gt; I'm still here. &gt;&gt; You've seen what I went through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You don't have to be an old man with white hair such as I am to have these things. &gt;&gt; You can have these things. &gt;&gt; Glory. said he became John became dismayed like many of us do when we see things going on that going on that isn't what we thought think it it just right we become dismayed he said don't be weary &gt;&gt; saying to us it will be all right &gt;&gt; he said the devil got a hold of him in there &gt;&gt; and the devil thought. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet's telling what the devil thought. &gt;&gt; He thought now I've got him in jail now. &gt;&gt; He sometimes gets you in a place where you can't hardly wiggle. &gt;&gt; Says, "I got you in jail now." &gt;&gt; He said, "And I throw him in jail, so I'll rough him up real good." And I got him in there. He said, "God isn't using him right now. I got him in jail, so I'll just put every kind of a blanket over him that I can. I got him all caged up. Said he got the eagle in the cage. So I'll just make him wish he had never preached the gospel. &gt;&gt; I'll make him wish he never said he was saved. &gt;&gt; I'll make him wish he never even testified about the camp experience. &gt;&gt; See, John had his camp experience, but it's the other end of it. &gt;&gt; You all know about the camp experience. John had his Mount Baker cab experience, but this is the other end of it. &gt;&gt; And all the time, John is still John. &gt;&gt; He's still a prophet. &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus said when he was at his lowest moment, Jesus raised him to his highest. &gt;&gt; And he said to the people, "What'd you go out to hear? Who did you go out to see?" A man in soft raignment, not John. Oh, it wasn't greater. He come with camel hair eating uh eating wild honey and locust. &gt;&gt; But he's still the same John. &gt;&gt; He had the big crowds and he baptized multitudes and baptized Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is saying there's no man like John. &gt;&gt; No greater had ever been born of woman. And there John is questioning him &gt;&gt; when he was at his lowest moment &gt;&gt; friends. I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; I'm declaring to you that God's thought of you &gt;&gt; will not change one iota. &gt;&gt; Whether you're whether you're on the ground or whether you're in the stratosphere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He won't change. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; In Micah, Malcia the prophet, he said how people become offended in Jesus &gt;&gt; and John had become. He didn't express it in that way, but kind of offended because the things didn't go just the way he thought it ought to because he introduced Jesus as Christ the Messiah. He says, "And so he couldn't hardly understand what was." And listen, I'll just say right here to anybody that's walked along this message highway for any amount of time, I can guarantee you that you could agree with me. Things didn't turn out just exactly the way you thought they were going to. &gt;&gt; You encountered stuff you never thought you'd ever encounter. &gt;&gt; But I will say to you that the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that called you &gt;&gt; to this message, &gt;&gt; he's the same one that vindicated this message. &gt;&gt; And he's still here. If he won't leave that message and you are that embodiment of the message and he will not leave it, he will not leave it. [cheering] &gt;&gt; No circumstance in this world can change God's mind. &gt;&gt; I don't care if all hell comes against you. &gt;&gt; He will not leave this message. That's one thing I can say to you. He will not leave it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you need that confidence. &gt;&gt; He will not leave this message. &gt;&gt; And if you stay with the message, you're staying with him. &gt;&gt; Just don't leave it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Jesus didn't give John instructions on how to be patient in prison. He said Jesus never sent him any book. Here's how to have patience while you're in jail. &gt;&gt; Let that sink in. &gt;&gt; You get in your prison. &gt;&gt; He's not going to just make things easier in your prison. &gt;&gt; And he may not deliver you out of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. The reason I say oh you say surely because this thing surely he doesn't want me in bound in this thing. He may not. But just in case you stay there, &gt;&gt; just in case the circumstances don't go away the way you think they ought to go away, &gt;&gt; your thought of your con your conviction, your uh confession of where you are and what happened to you must never change. &gt;&gt; John, even even when the guillotine was going to come down across his head, he could have said, "That's still him. That's still him. &gt;&gt; What I spoke is still true. &gt;&gt; He's still the Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of different things. Don't let me dwell on this too long, but there's a lot of different things that can become a literal jail house. &gt;&gt; Doors of opportunity. &gt;&gt; They made it look like doors of opportunity, but it actually might be a door, &gt;&gt; you know. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; into a prison. &gt;&gt; And I have seen people, I could count them, I could name them, &gt;&gt; that have gone the way of opportunity and ended up in jail. I talked to one person who had a high position in one of the software companies and we I said oh you worked there. Yeah. He said in the Velvet Prison &gt;&gt; I said pardon? He said we all call it the Velvet Prison. They just you couldn't live better. Oh, the food and all the perks and everything else, but you are completely swallowed up &gt;&gt; timewise. No time for family, no time for children, no time for wife. That's against the word of God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And the man lost his family. &gt;&gt; Lost his family because he was in a velvet prison. But you know, so Satan made his prison so nice. Oh, how how how could I leave how can I leave this kind of celery? &gt;&gt; How do I leave all these perks? &gt;&gt; How can I leave this? I can't leave this. But while he can't leave that, completely leave his spiritual life, completely leave God, completely leave the wife and family until they just disappear. &gt;&gt; Is that success? That's failure. Come on, &gt;&gt; friends. &gt;&gt; Soon as people start the message starts to the revelation of it starts to get to them. &gt;&gt; Oh man, you know, what is my wife going to do? What is my husband? What is my That's when you have to jump off the cliff. &gt;&gt; God's not dealing with the whole family. God's talking to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He may call you to a mountain. He may call you to a desert. He may call you to the city. He may call you to the great crowds. He may call you to just nothing to be alone. It that's irrelevant. That's none of our business. &gt;&gt; It's his business. &gt;&gt; What he made real to you. You say it's still real. It's still real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is it real, young people? &gt;&gt; What you experience is still real. &gt;&gt; You confess that it's still real. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may not feel the same. We say, "He's the same." &gt;&gt; Yesterday. &gt;&gt; And today. &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Yesterday &gt;&gt; and today and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll never change. &gt;&gt; He'll never leave it. &gt;&gt; Friends and family and relationship. friends. &gt;&gt; Come on, get it. &gt;&gt; Who's a friend? &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, &gt;&gt; I call you friends. &gt;&gt; Jesus called his disciples friends. &gt;&gt; They stayed with him &gt;&gt; through everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; They stayed with him when he had thousands in front of him &gt;&gt; and they just became servants and served bread and baskets of food and picked up the fragments that remained and didn't do a whole lot of great things. And then he he he's speaking of great things that are happening. He says, "What shall we have?" He'll say, "You sit with me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll sit on 12 thrones. &gt;&gt; And our prophet now comes Elijah says, "You sit with him." Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride sits with the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; The bride sits with her husband. &gt;&gt; In the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Oh my friends, &gt;&gt; we're just on a little short journey. &gt;&gt; But I have I have the message that God confirmed and said through a messenger. And after he says things like that, he starts calling people by name. &gt;&gt; Well, who is it? William Brandham doesn't know their name. It's God that knows their name. God knows your name. And I was I was just stunned once again as I listened because John sent God Jesus sent back to John really his first and second pole ministry the vindication &gt;&gt; and when I thought of the vindication and so I was listening particular to that and I thought God that's you this man doesn't know that crowd. He calls people and says, "You have something wrong with your back. You're praying for someone. It's a child. You're praying for another person. It's a woman and it's your wife and she has heart trouble." And some of the times the things seemed so insignificant and I thought, God, are you that concerned? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've lost sight of that. &gt;&gt; Ah, brother Ed Biscll, I've lost sight of that. I thought you're just maybe concerned about big things and you know doing things in missions or big things at the church or not just big things but you know all the burdens and solving this and solving that but he's interested in the small things. &gt;&gt; You you've even got a pain &gt;&gt; or you've got a sickness. You're not feeling well. &gt;&gt; He's here. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's here. And if he wanted to prove that to you, &gt;&gt; he'd prove that that's what I did. &gt;&gt; And if you will believe it, &gt;&gt; I'll do the same now. &gt;&gt; If you'll believe it, &gt;&gt; I'll do the same now. &gt;&gt; And one of the meetings, you can listen. He said, "There was a woman that brought a baby." Now, he's talking about the forgotten biatitude. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's his current sermon, the forgotten biatitude. Only preach it once. Go and listen to it. And he said a woman brought a baby and the baby had a twisted leg up behind it and was lame. And he said she wanted me to pray for it. And I prayed for it. And she went and told her husband and said they were so happy and then she came back and said, "Brother Brandham." Now she's where John was first. She had her Mount Baker experience. Oh, I I I got Brother Brandham. I got in front of him and and he prayed for my baby and she went away. Nothing happened. And then she had John's prison experience. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And she come back and she said, "Brother Brandham, nothing happened." And he just said, "Well, you know, it's it's it's all right." And he said, "You asked me to pray for it." I did. &gt;&gt; And she started to leave and go away. and she turned around and said, "Is it God's will for my baby to be lame?" And he said, "No, it certainly isn't God's will for your baby to be laid lame." And she said, "That's what she wanted him to say. &gt;&gt; That's what she wanted to hear." &gt;&gt; And it was just that one thing. And that leg came down. The baby was healed. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Does that sister happen to be here in the service?" And she stands up. He says, "Well, there she is. There &gt;&gt; there's the sister there." &gt;&gt; Now, he said, "There was another woman." &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "This woman is some years ago." And he said, "The woman had a huge tumor hanging outside of her body on her stomach and couldn't walk because of the size of the tumor. And the deacons had to pack her And he said they brought her up for prayer and God healed her and the tumor disappeared. And he said he uses the word smooth and she just became so smooth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It was gone. &gt;&gt; I wonder if that woman is here &gt;&gt; there. There she is way at the back. He said, "Sister, why don't you stand out in the aisle?" So she stood out in the aisle. He said, "Open up your coat." She opens up her coat. He says, "See there. &gt;&gt; Just smooth as can be. &gt;&gt; The tumor is gone." &gt;&gt; And he's pointing out what he was, &gt;&gt; he still is. &gt;&gt; And how long ago is that? 10, 12 years ago, he did it then. &gt;&gt; And he's going to do it now in a few minutes. Hallelujah. I said to myself, if we can just get our own people to believe, he did it 2,000 years ago, he did it 40 years ago, and he do it tonight. He'll do it today. It's exactly the same. There's nothing impossible. &gt;&gt; And we must not short change oursel. Believe to that. &gt;&gt; Believe unto that. &gt;&gt; You're going to need it sometime. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he said there was another person. &gt;&gt; He said, "Rosella, alcoholic." &gt;&gt; Oh. He said, "Rosella, are you here in the meeting?" Here's right close to the front. He says, "Here she is right here." He called five people. He called five people for five testimonies and they were all in the meeting. All right. &gt;&gt; And that was powerful for me. &gt;&gt; And he said, he said, "Excuse me, Sister Rosella, but he said, "When you came up, you were just a bad eyed old witch." I thought, "My for God's grace." And he says, "And here she is, a beautiful woman," he says. And she's probably she she looks 20 years younger than she actually is. That was I thought God give grace to Rosella. &gt;&gt; And years ago, Alcoholics Anonymous gave her up. Mother and Father gave her up. Family gave her up. You talk about a jail. But God brought them out of that jail. &gt;&gt; God's greater. Amen. &gt;&gt; He came to give deliverance &gt;&gt; to those that were in prison. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So Jesus said to the disciples of John, just stay and watch this service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see what's happening. &gt;&gt; Watch this afternoon's meeting &gt;&gt; and then go back and tell John what's happening. and and &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; blessed is he &gt;&gt; who's not offended in me. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't happen the way you think it should happen, remember this last beatitude. &gt;&gt; It's been rediscovered. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if it didn't happen the way we thought it was going to happen. Life didn't turn out the way we thought it was going to turn out. All you need to know, all you need to be able to say is he is here. &gt;&gt; He is here. &gt;&gt; He's revealed himself. &gt;&gt; And I was birthed &gt;&gt; not into a lodge, not into a church, not into a denomination. I was birthed into Christ. &gt;&gt; I was birthed &gt;&gt; in the very voice of God. Oh, you ought to say thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; for such a worm as I &gt;&gt; that you called me &gt;&gt; to be birthed under this visitation. &gt;&gt; You called me under this vindication. And on that basis, [cheering] I say you're the same yesterday, today, this morning. Hallelujah. February 13th, 2011. You're the same. Hallelujah. Increase my faith. Help our preacher to increase my faith. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, some of the young people are up here. I was once young, too. I was 14. And we were in a little house. And a preacher's son right beside me the pastor's son and we were at two kitchen chairs just kneeling after the service and uh old brother McGriff but just visiting and all I remember he just came he laid his hand on my back I think he laid his hand on my friend's back laid his hand on my back and he said and he started to break down he just started which she often did. He's very soft and he just kind of broke down and says, "Oh, God, make Eddie a preacher." And at those words, I just I just went in fragments. I just collapsed. I just split open and I sobbed and sobbed and sobbed. I didn't I didn't have any desire to be a preacher. I I didn't know what I was going to be. And uh but but I never forgot that. never forgot that there are things that happen in your life you never forget. &gt;&gt; You just remember them all the time. &gt;&gt; It might be the most, you know, almost coincidental. It just I happened to be there, he happened to be there and and and the and the boy that was beside me, he was about a year older than me. And we we were like brothers. He became very successful right in this city. The town we were in was called Greenwood. If you just drive over here to Guilford Shopping Center and drive on 104th Avenue, you'll see a whole string of apartments. They're called the Greenwood Apartments cuz they were his. He became very successful. That was probably a couple bars in his jail. He then he married a Catholic girl and I'd say that's another couple bars and now he had a whole busy life successful business in real estate and he could debate. He had a mind twice the mind that I have and he could just debate the scriptures and find this little, you know, inconsistency in the scripture and this which seemed to be inconsistent in the scripture and something that wasn't working just right. And he'd raise those up and and I got a phone call. He was 39 years old and he's in a hospital with cancer and they don't expect him to live very long and suddenly he wanted to do something for young boys in trouble who had had a difficulty. He wanted to give a and a minister called me a Pentecostal minister. I think he's still living here. And he called and he said he he wants to give a quarter of a million dollars right away. You know, before he dies, he wants to give a quarter of a million to build a a place of like a farm for boys and young men. Help them out. Those that have had a hard life. Never got to do it. Died in just a short few days. Was gone. Life snuffed out. There were two chairs. I didn't make any big right choices. All I can tell you is that when finally God dealt with me, you young man, you listen real close. when God dealt with me and I knelt at an altar and I was about 17 and I didn't have even what you had on on Saturday night out of the camp. But for me, that was it. &gt;&gt; I'm done. &gt;&gt; I just concluded right then, the devil's my enemy. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go his way. I didn't have a church like this to go to. &gt;&gt; I didn't have the message that you had. We didn't even know about the Godhead. &gt;&gt; We didn't know how to be baptized. We didn't know nothing. The rapture. It's out of our mind. We don't know anything about it. We're just totally ignorant people. But I knew one thing. I was done. &gt;&gt; I was done with the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm finished. &gt;&gt; I didn't have any big ambitions. There was nothing happening out on the streets. I didn't have any message books. We didn't have any tapes to listen to. But I was done, brother Ernie. I was finished with the world. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my challenge to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wasn't expecting a big Pentecostal thing the next night or a big hoopala the next day. I was done with the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was done with the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I gave my life to Christ &gt;&gt; and nothing has changed. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Who's 17 here? &gt;&gt; Are you done? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you done? &gt;&gt; Are you done? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who else is 17? Girls, you're done. Amen. I didn't dream you were 17. Who's 18 and under? Raise your hands. way high. Hallelujah. Are you done with the world? &gt;&gt; Even if you get to where John was. &gt;&gt; Is it real? Is it really real? I said it was so real. Is it really real? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it's real. &gt;&gt; Find me another message. Find me another Find me another messenger. Find me another one that God himself &gt;&gt; would not leave his side. Preachers were against him. Businessmen were against him. Everybody forsook him. But God wouldn't forsake him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God will honor your faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Alex said when they saw Matthew &gt;&gt; and finally break through, That's God, Matthew. &gt;&gt; That's God. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday as he was in Mount Baker and he's the same today. &gt;&gt; And you might have a jail house experience. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, the jail will not change Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It will not change him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Geneva and brother Matthew. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed. Don't be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've got a wonderful son and you've got other wonderful sons and God knows them and God's heard every prayer you've prayed and those that have been prayed in this church and we stand with you. [applause] We care nothing about what the devil does. God might take them very low, &gt;&gt; but all you have to say, we're in unity. My wife and I, we're in unity. We're in oneness. They belong to God. We're here to see things happen. We're not here to see just hear my sermons. We're here to see them happen. And I claim those boys with you in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause] Glory to God. We have every right to claim them. Ask what you will and it shall be done. [cheering] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is an emotion. What a reality. &gt;&gt; What other messenger? What other message? &gt;&gt; That's not Pentecost. It's not Presbyterian. It's nothing else. &gt;&gt; It's not Pentecost. God didn't God wouldn't allow his gift to be labeled. Right. &gt;&gt; And that's why he cries out in Chicago, cries out against them because they're so separated. &gt;&gt; And I want to say within this message, we shouldn't have this separation. We shouldn't be divided. This prophet spoke against it. &gt;&gt; I I I accept whatever blame I need to accept. But all I say is the word of God calls for blessed unity &gt;&gt; and love for the brethren. We don't embrace the world. &gt;&gt; If something's not the world, &gt;&gt; and when I surrendered my life, I just have to go back because he's the same yesterday. &gt;&gt; As he was today, as he is today, &gt;&gt; and my buddy went to the dance the following Saturday night. Broke my heart, but I had no desire for the dance. &gt;&gt; I said goodbye to the world. &gt;&gt; Goodbye to the devil. I said it when I was 20. &gt;&gt; I was about 21 years old. I have a car. I didn't even want a radio in the car. &gt;&gt; I bought a new car. I don't want a radio in the car. &gt;&gt; I drove into Vernon, British Columbia or Pentictton, British Columbia, filled up with gas and and banners on all the street lights and banners and the people in the party moved. And I drove in to get gas. And I I said, "What what's all the what's all the banners about?" He said, "The V's have come home." I said, "Who's the V's?" He almost punched me. He thought I was being, you know, being ridiculous. I don't know who the V's are. He said, "The V's. We've won the World Hockey Team or we've won world something." I I'm sorry. I don't I don't know anything about it. That was such an insult to him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But if he could have told me what just happened in Boisee, Idaho, I could have told him. I could have told him about the revival in Nampa, Idaho. I could have told him about so many people around the front, I couldn't even walk around them. I'm trying to find my way around repenting sinners. &gt;&gt; I knew what God was doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's the same, Brother Daniel. He's the same. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach it &gt;&gt; because I believe it &gt;&gt; and you're going to see it happen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And he's able to do it even now today. Now, &gt;&gt; surrender it. Let it go. &gt;&gt; Sink or swim. I'm going to serve God. &gt;&gt; When God sees that kind of dedication, &gt;&gt; he moves. &gt;&gt; He moves. &gt;&gt; Might have been too long. &gt;&gt; See, brother also explained it, and I'm going to close in a few minutes. He explained it. He says when the like the prophets, he said they would explain when they go up into those spheres. &gt;&gt; He called it spheres. They go up into those spheres and it does something to the human heart. &gt;&gt; And when you come down, when you come down, &gt;&gt; you get up into those spheres &gt;&gt; where we make promises to God. &gt;&gt; I came out of a meeting in Edmonton, Alberta. I said, "I can never be the same." Ever be the same. But a few days later, I found out I was the same. So I ought to have the same problems. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He says, "When you come down, when you come down, you can't explain it. You can't explain where you were. &gt;&gt; You can't explain this euphoria. &gt;&gt; You can't explain the glory of God. &gt;&gt; But don't deny it. It's still real." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And get all you can &gt;&gt; and enjoy it &gt;&gt; and give yourself to it. &gt;&gt; He said it takes you somewhere &gt;&gt; and there's no need of trying to talk about it. And then he went on to visions and so forth that tear you to pieces. You can't tell the other people. They don't understand it. They've never been there. &gt;&gt; So how would you know about it? Amen. &gt;&gt; When the inspiration leaves, he said, "And Elijah got nervous." &gt;&gt; You talk about inspiration, &gt;&gt; says gets on the mountain, Mount Carmel, showdown, &gt;&gt; calling fire from heaven, &gt;&gt; lick up all the &gt;&gt; all the water, &gt;&gt; slew 400 false prophets. Imagine it. &gt;&gt; I doubt if you'd want to follow that. Elijah said a man killed 400 prophets. &gt;&gt; He slew them and had a mighty victory. And then he heard that a woman was out after his head at Jezebel and he ran out into the wilderness and asked to die. &gt;&gt; Jonah preached in a city of Nineveh. And there's no record in the Bible of such a repentance. They even put sackcloth on all the animals and the cows. &gt;&gt; All the animals put sackloth on them and had such a repentance. &gt;&gt; Never was a repentance like that. A city of about 600,000 people and Jonah. And when he was done that the inspiration, he came down, &gt;&gt; he ran out into the wilderness &gt;&gt; and asked God to take his life. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; one was the Mount Baker experience. And the other might be not that I wish it &gt;&gt; but when it comes &gt;&gt; remember this service &gt;&gt; when trouble sets in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you find yourself in [applause] a jail, &gt;&gt; remember this service. &gt;&gt; It's the same message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same message that brought you in the same vindication, the same Christ, the same reality, the same supernatural. He has not changed. He's the same. And if you can believe it, what you ask for, you can have it. &gt;&gt; I'll close by saying this. God put a great conviction on me. &gt;&gt; Not just to preach an inspiration to you, &gt;&gt; but to make a declaration &gt;&gt; that this God &gt;&gt; is prepared and ready to move now. And I have a responsibility to increase your faith &gt;&gt; until you can believe it for now. I don't want you to believe it for next week. I want you to believe it for now &gt;&gt; and that you can hear, that you can testify. And I went back in my youth. We didn't go to church to hear sermons. We went to church to see things happen. &gt;&gt; And that's what we're supposed to be doing. &gt;&gt; This is not an idol God. We're to see things happen. I can I can I can &gt;&gt; relate to brother Alex's joy. But it's not just joy their prayer &gt;&gt; in Sister Bina. &gt;&gt; And then while the service was going on &gt;&gt; out at the camp, he was having his service here by streaming &gt;&gt; and he said testified to those you those of you that were here Wednesday testified and he's in the middle of the uh middle of the floor. And what were you saying, Brother Alex? &gt;&gt; I said, "Pour it down, God. &gt;&gt; Pour it down. Pour it down." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did he pour down? He poured it down. Pour it down, Lord. I say tonight, this morning, pour it down. Hallelujah. Let's not get so formal. Let's not have our services so structured, we can't afford to have them pour it down. See it happen. Glory to God. I say now, pour it down, oh God, &gt;&gt; and break prison doors, &gt;&gt; and bring your people out of prison. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's rise to our feet, shall we? &gt;&gt; Oh, how great is our God. &gt;&gt; How great is his name? &gt;&gt; He's the mighty one. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Jesus, we've come here to give you praise. We've come here to give you glory. Hallelujah. We've come here to tell the people, Father, you're the same, oh God. Elijah never lost his identity. Jonah never lost his identity. John never lost his identity. Hallelujah. You're the same, oh God. And whatever state we find ourselves in at this moment, oh Lord, you're the God. You're the God of the situation. You're the almighty one. and we surrender ourselves to you. Whatever you have in store for us, Lord, if it was us, John, then we say, "Fine, oh God, &gt;&gt; thy will be done. &gt;&gt; Thy will be done." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We give you praise. &gt;&gt; Ask of me. He said, &gt;&gt; "Ask of me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can say one thing. &gt;&gt; There has been, and I'm going to praise God about it. &gt;&gt; There has been a great infilling of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; taking place. &gt;&gt; It might be in your home. It might be in the church. It might be in the prayer service. I don't know where it is. It can be at the camp. A great infilling of the Holy Spirit. Some who have not been baptized, &gt;&gt; we're baptized. I have that absolute confidence. Some have been baptized in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And once you're baptized, it's all finished. &gt;&gt; It's done. You are sealed &gt;&gt; unto the day of your redemption. And if you're here and you've not been baptized &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; you say now, "Baptize her. &gt;&gt; Come baptize me." &gt;&gt; He can do it before you leave your seat. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, &gt;&gt; let your heart reach out. Let your hand be lifted up. Oh God, fill and refill with the Holy Spirit. Oh spirit of God, spirit of the living God, bring this people into one mind, into one mind, oh God, fill with your spirit, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who's here? who has not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And you want to receive it. They laid hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; If you believe it, &gt;&gt; if you believe it, &gt;&gt; you can come up sick and go away sick. &gt;&gt; But if you believed it, you come up sick, you go away healed. &gt;&gt; You want to be filled with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You want to come up here and stand here and we're going to pray with you. Fill me now, oh God. &gt;&gt; Fill me with the Holy Spirit, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I want to be filled with you. &gt;&gt; Filled with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's sing, fill me now. Fill me now, would you please? [music] me. [music] Oh, fill me now. Jesus, [music] come and fill me now. Fill [music] me with thy holy [music and singing] spirit. Come. Oh come and fill [music] me.

You must come believing this is it. I'm ready for this. I'm hungrying for this. Hallelujah. [applause] I need to be refilled. How many want to be refilled? &gt;&gt; Oh, fill [music] me now.

Glory to God. Glory to God. The devil's defeated. Devil defeated chains are broken. Hallelujah. When did this start, Joel? Last Wednesday. [music] It started last Wednesday. It started last Wednesday. Do you want to just say it started there? &gt;&gt; I just asked Joel. &gt;&gt; I just asked Joel where it started. Um well slowly uh over the last about two weeks probably God has slowly been [music] just tugging. feel a little tug. And &gt;&gt; and uh Wednesday especially I just I was at work and everything and [snorts] you know something just made me before work I just got to my knees and I had to pray and I prayed for [music] I prayed for everyone that's still out there. Prodigal was my brother. [music] And Andrew, I prayed for everyone. And [snorts] and then I just I felt uplifted because I haven't prayed for so long. [music] And then I just got around to my normal, you know, started to work again. And then I felt a cold spirit come over me again. And it it literally felt like like I was doomed. I felt like I'm if I'm going anywhere, I'm going to hell. [snorts] And I got down. I had to get down on my knees again and I had to pray straight away. And as soon as I did that, you know, the spirit, the cold spirit left. [music] &gt;&gt; And I had the best day ever at work. To be honest, I had a really good day. And [music] and then at night on the way home, it's just and and things have slowly been just leaving like like music. [music] I just I it's I switched it over to like a praise channel and you know I've been really getting into the music of [music] of God and and just praising while I'm driving to work and from work and and then I got home and [snorts] you know it kind of it of course it was Wednesday and I knew you know everyone's going to church you know it was in the back of my mind and then and I was going to do my normal routine is just go to the gym like I [music] always do. And I just, you know, I had got ready for the gym basically and and then I sat down on my bed and something did not let me go. &gt;&gt; I felt as if I literally had a battle inside of my head, the white dog and the black dog, and they were fighting so hard. And I I literally felt like there was a line drawn right across right in front of me and whatever I chose to do, it felt as if if I would go choose to go to the gym, it would lead me on a path that of darkness and there's no way that I'm coming back and if I would choose to go to church, I I felt like it was just the better choice. And [music] something didn't let me go to the gym. I I had I had to come to church on Wednesday night. And right when I walked into the door, Tim Andy's was praying. [music] And he said, um, he said, "You may someone here may not have even been at the meetings. Go to them, Father." And I said, "Wow, that's me." [music] And I I'm here. And then he said, "The drugs can't do it for you anymore. the alcohol can't do it for you anymore. &gt;&gt; And I said to myself right there, I was like, "This is exactly where I'm supposed to be." [applause] &gt;&gt; And and since and since Wednesday night, [music] I've had the drugs right in front of me. I've had the alcohol right in front of me. And absolutely no desire for it whatsoever. [applause] no desire whatsoever. And I thank I thank I thank God because I thought I'd be I thought there was no no possible way of me coming back here. And I came up I sat beside my dad. I felt like I felt so at home. &gt;&gt; I felt this is I felt I've never felt so happy in my life. And I'm I'm just praying I'm just praying for an absolute total deliverance. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I just want to I just want to thank God for what he's done. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to press on &gt;&gt; because there's nothing out there that the devil offers that's worth it. &gt;&gt; Nothing. Nothing at all. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for for revealing that to me. &gt;&gt; I just give him all the glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; Come to church to see things happen &gt;&gt; and go out and see greater things happen. You're the children of the greater works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Brother Mike, why don't you just come and ask God's blessing on the people [music] and &gt;&gt; and we'll we'll let you go and have a bite to eat before tonight. Are you speaking tonight, Brother Tom? &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; We [music] have have an amazing real God. &gt;&gt; Does incredible things [music] &gt;&gt; you do, oh, &gt;&gt; let's bow our heads. [music] &gt;&gt; Precious Lord, &gt;&gt; there's nowhere else we can feel at home. There's nowhere we want to be, Lord God. &gt;&gt; There's no pleasure. There's nothing &gt;&gt; Lord that can fill, that can satisfy like you can, Lord Jesus. And your prophet said that you wanted to fill us more than we wanted to be filled. Each one of us in here, Lord God, has built our own prisons. I for one, Lord God, have built a prison of my own, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask you, Lord God, to tear down the bars, Lord God. Those things that hinder us, Lord Jesus, those things that we allow in our lives that aren't they're not us. They're not us. We don't belong in that prison, Lord. But as John was there for a season, Lord, &gt;&gt; he had a purpose and a reason there. Paul was there for a reason. Peter was there for a reason, Lord. There was great victory that came, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; There was overcoming, Lord God. There was people raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; There was jailers converted, Lord God. Lord, our brother that gave the testimony here, he's already prayed for others that are in this circumstance he was days ago, Lord God, that are they are his bars being loosed. And he's pulling out his brethren, his friends, Lord God, that are still there, still trapped, Lord God. Lord, your seed continually cries out. And Lord God, we know Lord God that there is victory for us. Lord Jesus, we thank you Lord for ministry Lord that has labored, surrendered all their lives.

God, &gt;&gt; I do believe if we have to open a testimony service, God, we go on and on and on and on because [music] you just pull yourself down. Oh God, you've opened the gate of heaven and let your blessing pour upon your bride and we've claimed every promise that is written in the Bible that is us. Oh God, I just want to remember sister Natasha and uh her husband, they have a baby which is sick. God is standing now. I've been a testimony not even five minutes ago coming with high fever home. Oh God, the devil just burning [music] me down. I couldn't walk. I couldn't do anything. Called brother Sam Ray and called brother Emanuel. They just laid hand on me and the devil just flew away. You're the same God. I believe you God. And I ask you heavenly father. I just want to bring the child in your presence by the way of prayer and ask you God to go where the baby is and touch the baby for your name, oh God, so we can come back and give glory and thanksgiving to you because you deserve it. There's no God like you on earth, oh God, on heaven. None is like you, oh God. Your name is above all name, Jesus Christ.

Oh God, every step of our life, you come with a perfect message for the right time. Oh God, we can understand. Oh Jesus Christ, we can go as a John the Baptist. We can go like Elijah. But know the living God is there. If we fast, he will take us because you never change. Oh Jesus Christ. [music] Oh heavenly father, now let if there's anyone here who may be in a prison like John.

I can feel it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's wonderful to be in the presence of the Lord this evening. Amen. Um, I wasn't really going to sing this song, but um, when brother Kyra was preaching on um, the thin line between mercy and judgment, it like the chorus mercy said no, kept coming to my head and it kept coming to me the whole week and like I just want to thank God for his mercy and it's he's become so real in my life. So, thank you &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; I was just a child when I felt the Savior leading. [music] I was drawn to what I could not [music] understand. Before the cause of [music] Christ, I have spent my days believing [music] that what he had me be is who I [singing] am. [music] As I come to [singing] see the weaker side of me, I realize his grace is what [music] I need. When sin demanded justice [music] for my soul, [singing] mercy said, "No, I'm not [music] going to let you go. [singing] I'm not going to let you slip [music] away. You don't have to be afraid. [singing] Mercy said, "No, sin will never [music and singing] take control. Oh, life and death stood face to face. [music] Darkness [singing] tried to steal my heart away. [music] Savior Jesus, mercy said no. [singing] [music] For God so loved [music] the world that he sent his son to save [singing] us. From the cross [music] he built a bridge to set us free. [music] Oh, but deep within our hearts, there is still a war [music and singing] that rages. Makes a sacrifice [singing] so hard to see. As midnight fell [singing] on crucifixion [music] day, the [music and singing] light of hope seem all so far [music] away. [singing] As evil tried to stop, [singing] redemptions [music] flow. Mercy said, "No, I'm not [music] going to let you go. I'm not going to let you slip away. [music] You don't have to be afraid. [singing] Mercy said no. Sin will never take control. Life and death stood face the face [music and singing] as darkness tried to steal my heart away. Thank you Jesus. [music] Mercy said no. [singing] [music] And now when heaven looks at me, it's through the blood of Jesus [music and singing] reminding me of one day long ago. [singing and music] [music] Oh, [singing] [music] mercy said, "No, [singing and music] I'm not going to let you go. I'm not going to let you slip away. You don't have to be afraid. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Mercy send the world. [singing] Sin will never take control. Life and death stood face to [singing] face. [music] Darkness try to steal my heart away. [singing] Thank you, [music] Jesus. Mercy said no. [music] Mercy [music and singing] said no. [music] [applause] I'm amazed. Amen. As [music] Michael comes, I'm amazed [singing] [music] that you love me. I'm amazed [music] for how you came through your preious [music and singing] blood. I found pardon in my sins and my [music] sins. They're washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed [music] away. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; that you love me. [singing] How you [music] care for me through your preious blood I found pardon and [music] my sins. All my sins they're [singing] washed. They're all washed away. [music] All my sins [singing] are wash away. [music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That seems like an anthem. We've sung it many times, but it doesn't get doesn't get old. It just seems new every time we sing it. Amen. just a song that you've all heard before, but um it just was been on my heart for a little while and I just felt pressed and pressed to sing it. I thought maybe I'd sing it at camp, but it just maybe wasn't the right time. So, hearing the message this morning and uh knowing that we've been on a mountaintop, but it's in that valley that we are our our experience is tested. And uh you know it's important that we can look back to the anchor that we placed maybe for those at camp and you can say no God met me there and that was a real experience and you can hold on to that anchor. So we're just going to sing sing a song. If you know it and you want to sing along feel feel free. It make me feel a little bit less nervous. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It's [music] not hard to believe. Standing on the mountain [music] tops of glory. [music] Oh, [singing] when you can hear the songs of angels and a [music] breeze from heaven sends your spirit soar. [music] Oh, but in the valley once more, will Jesus still [music] be Lord? That's the question. [music] Cuz believe in believing [music] isn't easy. That is the testing. [music] Oh, and I need faith for the times [music] when the sun doesn't shine and the mountain top is just [music] a memory. When there's no signs to be seen and you don't [music] feel a thing to the word of God alone, I can cling. [music] Oh, and I need faith for the day. When troubles [music] come my way [singing] and I just don't understand what it means, that's when nothing [music] else will do. Faith alone will see through and believing [music] becomes my victory. [music] Oh, it's not hard to believe when things are going well [music] and skies are sunny. Oh, when you feel you're making [music] progress and doing good, [singing] living in a time of [music] plenty. Oh, but [music and singing] if all of that should change, will you still keep the faith? [singing] That's the question. [music] Oh, cuz belieing [music] when believing isn't easy. [music] Oh, that [singing] is the testing. Hey man, let's sing it. Oh, [music] and I need [singing] for the time when the sun does not shine [music] and the mountain top is just oh [singing] and there's no sign to [music] be seen and you know [singing] do the word [music] Oh [music and singing] my for the day when troules come my [singing] way and I just don't understand [music] what it means. Oh that's when nothing else will do [music] if the Lord will see you through and believing [music] becomes my glory. Oh, [music] will you be faithful for the time when the sun does [music and singing] not shine and mountain top is just my [music and singing] sign to be seen and to the [music] word [singing] I all [music] and I think for the day when troules [music] come my way [singing] and I just don't understand what it means. [music] That's when nothing else will do. Faith alone [music] will see me through and believing becomes my victory. [music] [music] [singing] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music and singing] [music] Heat. [singing] Heat. [music] [singing] [music] My Heat. Heat. Heat. [music and singing] [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [applause] Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Glorious &gt;&gt; Jesus. It just seems that we're about basking in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So thankful &gt;&gt; so blessed [music] &gt;&gt; as we can say like the psalmist David your mercies are new every day. &gt;&gt; We thank you for these times Lord. These are wonderful times of refreshing, &gt;&gt; wonderful times in your presence. [music] And Father, we're asking once again [music] that as we have gathered around the word of God, the preeminent one, the Holy One, &gt;&gt; our King and Lord, &gt;&gt; our lovely Lord Jesus. We worship you tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; if we could just lift you up, Lord. [music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so as we will look in your word, we pray, Father, that you'll inspire us again and [music] help your people. &gt;&gt; We need help. We understand that there is a blind leody blind &gt;&gt; in need of nothing. &gt;&gt; And yet we're in need [music] of everything. They might not want you, but we do, Lord. &gt;&gt; More and more and more we thirst [music] after thee, the living God. &gt;&gt; And so, Lord, as we now turn to the word, would you speak to us [music] that somehow we could just close oursel &gt;&gt; in a little booth with you and tell you how lovely you are. &gt;&gt; Speak to us now we pray father committing all things into your care in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelations 12. God bless you all. Revelation chapter 12. We'll be reading from verse 22. I'm sorry, my Bible flipped on me. Okay. Revelation 12:7 to 11. Amen.

Amen. &gt;&gt; And they, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; us, &gt;&gt; you sir, &gt;&gt; me &gt;&gt; overcame &gt;&gt; him &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And they overcame him &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb and by the word &gt;&gt; by the word &gt;&gt; by the word of their testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young people, you say, "I got a testimony." How are you going to overcome?

The sick are healed. &gt;&gt; The lost are saved. &gt;&gt; The blind see. &gt;&gt; That's what we heard. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, Joel. &gt;&gt; That's what this is about. &gt;&gt; We claim the token. &gt;&gt; Should we expect anything less? &gt;&gt; No, sir. This is what we live for. &gt;&gt; I love it when I come to church and somebody says, "Did you see who's here? Did you see who's there? Did you see who's there? I said, "Yeah, Joel is there." &gt;&gt; I said, "That's a sign. &gt;&gt; That's an indication. &gt;&gt; That's what we believe." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I It is just wonderful. &gt;&gt; It's glorious to me. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; this has been going on for months. &gt;&gt; This has been going on for months. It wasn't just at camp. We had all the parents here before camp. &gt;&gt; I I was going to actually have another another stand for the old people. &gt;&gt; You stood here for your children. &gt;&gt; You stood here for your children. The AM before the AM. &gt;&gt; And God confirmed his word. &gt;&gt; God confirmed your prayers. &gt;&gt; God is in the midst. &gt;&gt; Say, "Where's God?" Wake up. &gt;&gt; Wake up. God's everywhere. &gt;&gt; I've been in so enjoying. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But how are we going to overcome? We're going to overcome by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; We're going to overcome by this message alone and by our testimony that's in this bleeding word. &gt;&gt; There's no other message, saints of God, that is going to deliver a young man. Pentecost can't do it. They're in their quagmire today. They have no power, no word. But the church of the living God has wonder working power. &gt;&gt; Glory. People are bound. People are bound because they want to be bound. &gt;&gt; But not in this church. &gt;&gt; If you want to be free, &gt;&gt; right? What's your title, Brother Tom? &gt;&gt; The title tonight is what is their testimony? &gt;&gt; I'm taking it out of Brother Bram's message, faith in action. &gt;&gt; What is your testimony? &gt;&gt; What is your testimony? Here he says, he says, "When the great redeemed of host stand around the throne of God waving the white palms, palms in their hand with white robes washed in the blood of the lamb." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "We'll tell the story of how we overcome." &gt;&gt; How do we overcome? &gt;&gt; By the blood of the lamb &gt;&gt; and by their testimony. Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is their testimony &gt;&gt; title? What is your testimony? &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; Jesus lives. &gt;&gt; The word's alive. &gt;&gt; What's your testimony? He lives. Christ Jesus lives today. Where, brother Tom? He lives in me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. We didn't leave him at camp, Nathan. We got God living in me. &gt;&gt; He lives. What's your testimony, Jonathan? &gt;&gt; Jesus lives. Where? &gt;&gt; Come on, young people. Where? &gt;&gt; He lives in me. What's your testimony? The bleeding lamb still lives. &gt;&gt; The bleeding word's alive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you believe when you pray, you shall have what you ask. &gt;&gt; He lives. &gt;&gt; People are looking for God. God came down in this generation. Science took a picture of it. That pillar of fire was here. Hung with a prophet. &gt;&gt; The world's missed it. But by the grace of God, you can say Jesus lives. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The word lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, you say you're getting a little excited, Brother Tom. &gt;&gt; Well, I have a quote. We hadn't finished the quote yet, Brother Randy. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, let it ring out through the mountains. Jesus lives." &gt;&gt; When you go to college tomorrow, Jesus lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, where is he living? He lives in me. &gt;&gt; He lives in you. &gt;&gt; When Jesus started to identify himself, &gt;&gt; the father. When you seen me, you seen the father. Blasphemy. We are the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; We are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Notice he said being personally identified the original headship. We have the answer to every devil's question. &gt;&gt; We have the answer to the devil's question. He Christ is risen. &gt;&gt; The bleeding word is alive. &gt;&gt; And he has paid the price. Raised up the head and the body. The devil can't stand it. &gt;&gt; You're going to have a fight. The devil can't stand it. But he has given us the bleeding bloody word and your testimony to overcome the devil. &gt;&gt; Not somebody else's testimony, Joel. Your testimony. I have a testimony. You heard a testimony. Gary, you got a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, God's in the church. God better be in the church. &gt;&gt; You are the church." &gt;&gt; Well, say, "God's in the church." That's exactly right. God's in me. &gt;&gt; God's in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the reason." He said the devil, he's howling the way he is. His wickedness, his scheme has been uncovered by the resurrected Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the headship over his body, God has given his mind, his thought towards every situation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You think I'm beside myself. I am not. We've got the devil's answer. Not me. But there was the Christ, the word living in me. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's not my idea. It's his power. Not my idea. It's his word. It's Christ myster. Christ is risen. Paid the price for our redemption. &gt;&gt; What God in Christ manifested. He gave the flesh and the blood that in the blood might come life and the flesh be redeemed. that was God in this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for this day as he did in that day. &gt;&gt; Glory. You see it? Oh my. I just can't stop. Neither can I. &gt;&gt; Notice we stand justified in the very presence of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "As a drop of ink dropped into a tub of bleach, you'll never find the stain again. No more. It went somewhere. It never will come back again. And a man that's truly been redeemed. &gt;&gt; The predestinated seed genes of God. Are you the redeemed? &gt;&gt; It's gone. &gt;&gt; It's gone. &gt;&gt; You have overcome. &gt;&gt; By the bleeding word and by your testimony that you believe it, &gt;&gt; it's dropped into the inca blood of Jesus Christ, never ever to be remembered again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to be to God. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. God forgets it and he and he stands as a son and daughter of God in the presence of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we are the sons of God. Not we will be. We are. Preach on this the Wednesday before camp. We're redeemed. We have Satan's answer. God's vindicated himself. &gt;&gt; Proved himself to his promise in this day. The headship is here. Christ the risen Lord. It's here in the same power. &gt;&gt; God help us to believe. &gt;&gt; In the same power of his resurrection manifesting himself. &gt;&gt; That's the devil's answer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ in you. God's great revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What is their testimony &gt;&gt; and what is yours? &gt;&gt; Jesus lives. &gt;&gt; I serve a risen savior. &gt;&gt; He lives. Christ Jesus lives. Today, brother Bram said in Revelation of Jesus Christ series. How are you over? How do you overcome? By the blood of the lamb and the words of your testimony. He takes consider this. Since the blood of God is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin, then the loosing is perfect, &gt;&gt; complete. &gt;&gt; Therefore, there is no condemnation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, brother David. &gt;&gt; Devil comes so quickly, &gt;&gt; so quickly tomorrow, &gt;&gt; so quickly, young people. to come against you, &gt;&gt; to condemn you, &gt;&gt; but you take God at his word &gt;&gt; right here, right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's perfect loosing and it's complete. &gt;&gt; There is no condemnation whatsoever. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's God that justifies and calls you righteous. &gt;&gt; It's Christ that died. There it is. His death gave us the blood. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; His death gave us the blood. &gt;&gt; The blood has loosed us. &gt;&gt; There is no condemnation. How can there be? There's nothing to condemn you for. &gt;&gt; Because the blood has loosed us from all [screaming] our sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but those prison bars just opened up. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That blood has loosed us. No condemnation. How can there be? There is nothing to condemn. For the blood has loosed us from sin. We're free. We're guiltless. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the greatest of the Pentecostal teachers this last week has come forth and said, "I don't believe in the blood anymore." &gt;&gt; One of the greatest, they followed him for years and comes forth and doesn't believe in the blood. But let me tell you young people, you wash yourself in that bleeding word and let that word become your testimony, you'll overcome every devil there is. &gt;&gt; They don't want the power of the blood. I'll take the power of the blood. &gt;&gt; Glory. Look what it's doing to you. It's changing you from glory unto glory unto glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why the devil's howling. You think he's going to be happy about you young people going to be happy about you parents, about your children, happy about you getting victory over things that were in your life for so many years. You think he's happy? He is not happy. He's howling. But we've got a word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bradam said he said he couldn't give us anything greater than what he's already given. &gt;&gt; The word of God. He just makes it more real. &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh God, let our eyes be open to see your word more real than it's ever been before." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; More real. &gt;&gt; By your testimony, &gt;&gt; how you're believing, &gt;&gt; how are you believing? Great. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say great. &gt;&gt; How are you believing? &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; I'm really believing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you really believing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He bought us. Revelation of Jesus Christ. He's bought us. He's purchased us. He's bought us. Christ purchased you &gt;&gt; at Calvary. He bought you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're no longer your own. He purchased you. You are his. &gt;&gt; God is watching over you. You're his property. &gt;&gt; That's why the devil wants you. &gt;&gt; You're God's property. He's an enemy, but he lost. &gt;&gt; We've read he's lost. He has bought us for a purpose. We are kings. &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm a king." &gt;&gt; I'm a king. &gt;&gt; I'm an absolute king. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We are kings. We're spiritual kings. Oh, we're going to be kings upon the earth with him when he sits upon his throne. Great statement. But now, &gt;&gt; now, &gt;&gt; but now, &gt;&gt; now we are spiritual kings. &gt;&gt; By your testimony, &gt;&gt; but now, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a spiritual king. Can you say that? But now, &gt;&gt; I am a spiritual king. &gt;&gt; We reign over a spiritual kingdom. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. For brother Bram takes Romans 5:17. For by one man's offense, death reigned by one. Much more they which receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Scripture Colossians 1:13, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son. &gt;&gt; Right now we reign with Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now &gt;&gt; your testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; How are you believing? &gt;&gt; Great. Right now, you are a spiritual king &gt;&gt; glory. Reigning with Christ. &gt;&gt; Having dominion. &gt;&gt; Come on, kings. &gt;&gt; Come on, queens. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said you are. That's what God said through a prophet. You are. &gt;&gt; Amen. having dominion over sin, &gt;&gt; the world, your flesh, &gt;&gt; the devil. &gt;&gt; That's overcoming power. &gt;&gt; Sounds good to me, brother Tim. &gt;&gt; Showing forth his praise and glory, &gt;&gt; showing forth himself. &gt;&gt; And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. And they love not their lives unto death. &gt;&gt; How's your belie? How are you believing? &gt;&gt; Good. Sounding good. Carlos, how are we believing back there? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; It's by your testimony. &gt;&gt; Go believing. &gt;&gt; Go rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Listening. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now let's liken that today. Palestine belonged to Israel. They were dwell that that was in their dwelling place. You see, that was their dwelling place for Israel to dwell in. This body is yours. &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, we're going to get it down to your address. Spiritual kinks &gt;&gt; reigning over. &gt;&gt; Sin, the world, flesh, the devil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm reading from your your inheritance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm reading from the word of God tonight. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Listen. He said, "The body's yours. God gave it to you. It's your dwelling place. God wants you to have it. But the devil has moved in with cancer, tuberculosis, diseases. You say, "I'll take him out. I'll do this. I'll do that." But you know what? Something's happened. The pillar of fire has come amongst us. &gt;&gt; The captain of the Lord of hosts is here. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; yes. Every devil that's got the people bound tonight is scared to death. &gt;&gt; I believe that same God is here tonight. &gt;&gt; And those devils are scared to death. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what he says? Sure they are. &gt;&gt; I thought you heard he's the same yesterday. Come on, brother. You said this morning. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; If they were afraid under a prophet's ministry, they are afraid under a bride's ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. She is the final voice to the final age under her messenger. And the devil's scared tonight because young people are getting anointed &gt;&gt; because elders are getting anointed. &gt;&gt; People are getting anointed. &gt;&gt; Glory. Don't miss it. Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Don't cool your jets. Don't do that. Don't not do that. You press yourself in. &gt;&gt; You say, "Whatever God's got, I want what God has." &gt;&gt; Don't you be a spectator now. You press yourself into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; This is not a time to cool off. This is a time to press in. &gt;&gt; We are. You are. God is. &gt;&gt; He's amongst us. You say, "I'll take him out. &gt;&gt; I'll do this. I'll do that." But you know something? Something happened. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire has come amongst us. &gt;&gt; The captain of the Lord of hosts is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why did these Philistines go forth faint? Why did Jericho faint? Why did they faint? Because they heard of the great exploits. &gt;&gt; Glory. They are fainting tonight. &gt;&gt; Because of the exploits. &gt;&gt; Glory. They are nervous that you're actually going to get this. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And we are getting it. And they are fainting. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory. Brother Brandham said they are fainting &gt;&gt; the same way that the Philistines did. &gt;&gt; Why did Jericho faint? Because the people had the promise was on the road and they're coming in. &gt;&gt; Let's go. &gt;&gt; Let's go. I am so thankful we don't have a captain here that says a little water over here and a little water over there. We got a pastor that said, "Let's go. [applause] Glory. This is what I believe." Saints a little water over here. Fellas, you got a problem. Oh, don't bother me with that. What are you talking about? My Bible says when one suffers we all suffer. &gt;&gt; But my Bible also says when one rejoices. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] Glory &gt;&gt; sir. They're fainting saints of God. Why? because we are coming into our promise. &gt;&gt; And the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise when, brother Tom, it could happen tonight. &gt;&gt; We've sung about it for 30 years. Now, let's see the manifestation of it. Brother Bram said in the message, boy, what is the Holy Ghost given for? To raise the dead. &gt;&gt; Who's going to call him for? You and I. This whole world will never hold me. &gt;&gt; Never ever ever going to hold me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had the promise was on the road to come in. Amen. And that's the one that's got the promise. The people. The covenant people. &gt;&gt; The covenant people. We've been going over the covenant &gt;&gt; the last few services. When God gives a covenant, it is unconditional and it's given by grace. Abraham had nothing to do with it. God had everything to do with it. &gt;&gt; And when God gives a covenant, saints of God, he's not an Indian giver. &gt;&gt; He does not give it to you one day and take it back the next. If God has given you a covenant, it is forever. &gt;&gt; Lori. Lori. Listen. Samson, listen. Samson, listen. &gt;&gt; He was under a covenant. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; He beat the devil down hip and thigh. &gt;&gt; Tore a lion in a half like a kid. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Took the gates of his city far gate and all. &gt;&gt; But his eyes got turned away. &gt;&gt; But God will never forget his covenant. &gt;&gt; You might have turned away, young people, but God remember his covenant. All &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Can I give you a scripture? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Can I give you a scripture I've been wanting to say for just the last few weeks and can't get it out, but tonight I'll say it. &gt;&gt; How be it, &gt;&gt; the hair of his head began to grow. Hallelujah. God saw him in the prison. &gt;&gt; God saw him down there. &gt;&gt; And God remembered his covenant. &gt;&gt; God has given you a covenant. You might have gone wayward one day, but he remembered his covenant to you. &gt;&gt; What was the cry of Samson? God, one more time. I've had many victories when I was a young boy, Joel. But my hair started to grow and I remember my covenant with you. &gt;&gt; Glory. And it's unconditional. &gt;&gt; And you and I have been given a token promise. Brother Ram call it a token covenant. Come on. &gt;&gt; Your children were talking about &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the words of their testimony. I believe Jesus saves. &gt;&gt; I believe Jesus is alive. I believe that word is burning in my soul tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses. &gt;&gt; So shall I be with you Joshua. &gt;&gt; Amen. What did he do? Meditated on the word of God day and night. &gt;&gt; Lord, today is it rapture. Today is it the change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Spiritual kings &gt;&gt; having dominion now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; As I was with Moses, whatsoever things you desire when you pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe and you will receive them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You heard. She will do the greater works. &gt;&gt; Those greater works, saints of hear. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But believing that those things that you say shall come to pass, you will have it. Whatsoever he says, &gt;&gt; he says, "Whatsoever you confess, &gt;&gt; how's your believing?" &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; If in your heart tonight, if you're dying with heart trouble, &gt;&gt; now listen, saints of God, listen, saints. We don't have a prophet here to discern you, &gt;&gt; but the word of God is still a discerner of the thought, the intent of the heart. He's still a word. Is that true? &gt;&gt; And here here now here. Brother Brown, I just listened to him yesterday. He said, "You've come to service." &gt;&gt; He says, "You've come to service." One more time. He said, "You've come to service." He says, "Now, it might not go on for a couple of weeks, but you will find out you're whole. You're healed. God has given you what you've desired &gt;&gt; cuz his word cannot return unto him void." How is your believing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Whatsoever you confess, if you in your heart tonight, if you're dying with heart trouble, &gt;&gt; listen saints. I don't even know. We could have I could have had heart blockage for all I know for the last 10 years. Some service God just comes down. Sweet Holy Spirit, come move, flutter over us. &gt;&gt; Go see a heart specialist and say, "You don't have that gene anymore." &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; How is your believing tonight? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your problem is tonight. My Jesus lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You might been dying with heart trouble. You might have got cancer. You uh if you would believe with all your heart, something's anchored in there and you believe Jesus and I believe with all my heart. Now I accept him as my healer. I believe your soul believes I'm healed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He does miracles. &gt;&gt; How's your believing? &gt;&gt; So great. &gt;&gt; He does miracles so great. &gt;&gt; Oh, let him that's weak say, I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just say in your heart, I'm now strong. &gt;&gt; I'm now strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's by your testimony. &gt;&gt; I am strong. I have now accepted Jesus as my healer and never have any negative testimony anymore. Just believe it. God is under obligation. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is sitting at the right hand of the father to accept you. &gt;&gt; For he's sitting there as the high priest of your confession to make it good before the father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, divine healing, brother said, cannot be any planer than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's to the weakest. &gt;&gt; Remember, God's word will defeat Satan, &gt;&gt; any place, &gt;&gt; any time, &gt;&gt; anywhere. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're being equipped &gt;&gt; by the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, healing is not something you just say, "Oh, yeah. I believe it. I believe it." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's [snorts] that's all right." If that's the best you can do just mentally or just say, "Yes, I believe that. I accept it." Then if you accept it on those basis, keep now then saying it over. &gt;&gt; You know, we got to get away of coming up front next week. Coming up front next week, coming up front next week, coming up. Just keep on saying it. &gt;&gt; I'm healed. &gt;&gt; By his stripes, I'm whole. &gt;&gt; Go home. I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Go to work. I'm healed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on, John Ryan. Come on, John Ryan. &gt;&gt; That's a principle. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The right mental attitude towards any promise of God. He will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Just keep saying it over and over and over. &gt;&gt; Let your testimony be. &gt;&gt; I am filled with God. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. Say it out loud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Say it out loud. He said &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say it over. &gt;&gt; Now we are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Now I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; I have got the devil's answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the word. &gt;&gt; Say it over. &gt;&gt; Keep saying it. &gt;&gt; I am healed. &gt;&gt; I am healed. &gt;&gt; I am healed. &gt;&gt; Till finally you actually believe it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And when you believe it, then it's going to take place. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Every time when you confess, well, I feel a little bad today. How many of us have felt bad since camp? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. There's some honest souls out there, man. The next day, I couldn't even drag myself out of bed. And God bless my little queen. &gt;&gt; She has taught me over the years, get up. Look out brothers that are looking to marry a nurse. &gt;&gt; Get out of bed. I thought they were supposed to wait on you hand and foot. [laughter] Hey, I love a good confession. &gt;&gt; How you feeling, honey? &gt;&gt; Great. Get you out of bed. &gt;&gt; It'll get you cleaned up. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll get you in your in your clothes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then after a little while, you're not feeling so bad. &gt;&gt; And then all of a sudden, it gets you a little bit of faith. By his stripes, I am healed. By his stripes, I am healed. &gt;&gt; Man, my throat is shot. I feel like I like I got hit by a train. But praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; we're running over the devil on a runaway train. [applause] &gt;&gt; Why? We got a positive confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. He said you'll never live above your confession. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the high priest of our confession. Any scholar knows that he said profession is confession translated the same. He sits on the right hand of the father interceding upon that. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says now he cannot heal you &gt;&gt; or cannot save you. or do one thing for you &gt;&gt; until first you accept it. &gt;&gt; Confess it. &gt;&gt; How's your believing? &gt;&gt; He said, "Believe it." &gt;&gt; That's right. You've got to confess it, &gt;&gt; not your feeling. &gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with your feelings &gt;&gt; because tomorrow you could feel rotten. You say, "I wish I was at camp." It has nothing to do with your feelings. It has everything to do with your believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I accept it. I believe it. I confess it. &gt;&gt; It's not how you feel it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is not the high priest of your feelings. Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'd love a 100% amen on that one, Brother Tom. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with your feelings. It has everything to do with your believing. &gt;&gt; And let that be your testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's what you confess. Now, if you'll get prayed for, sit in the building this afternoon, the Holy Spirit move in here, you'd feel his blessed presence. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And everyone and you would walk out and say, "Well, I feel as bad as I did when I went in." He couldn't do a thing for you. &gt;&gt; Not a thing. &gt;&gt; Well, I accept it now. And then in the morning, get up. Well, I got a headache. &gt;&gt; I still feel as bad as I did. Then you drop right down. &gt;&gt; Way down. You'll never live above your confession. I don't care how we feel, young people, ever again. &gt;&gt; I don't care how you feel. &gt;&gt; You go by how you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you believe? &gt;&gt; You'll never live above your confession. Let the saintliest person, this is a this is an incredible statement. Let the saintliest person in this building building right now just make up in your mind you're not a Christian anymore &gt;&gt; and you wonder some of you guys backsliding whatever &gt;&gt; you just don't want to be &gt;&gt; listen what he says he says the saintliest Christian &gt;&gt; in this building just make up in your mind you're not a Christian anymore then you will not be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Oh, how's your believing? &gt;&gt; It's being recorded. &gt;&gt; There's a recording angel here. &gt;&gt; Can you wave your hand and say it great, Brother Tom? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go by my feelings anymore. I'm going to go by faith &gt;&gt; for I'm going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and by my testimony. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, I used to be. I'm not no more. You're fallen from grace. Right. Then &gt;&gt; it's faith. It's either faith or unbelief. &gt;&gt; You're possessed with two powers. Either faith or unbelief. And if you got faith, you're saved because you are a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now, saints of God, you that would sit back and let the devil run over you, shame on you. &gt;&gt; We overcome by the bleeding word &gt;&gt; and by our testimony. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. One hour, we're done. &gt;&gt; Can I give you a little testimony? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes things happen you do not understand. You wonder whether they did happen. Remember my last service here, Journey to Liberty. &gt;&gt; Sunday morning, then Wednesday night. Then we went to camp. My last quote, my last quote I left off. Wouldn't you like to live where you're conscious of the unseen world? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you like to live in that realm? &gt;&gt; I believe God is pulling us into that realm, into the unseen realm. He said, "Wouldn't you like to live in that realm?" And &gt;&gt; Amen. where where you are all the and you realize it all the time to realize when you walk out there, you get in your car and angels take their position to your side. &gt;&gt; When you walk up yonder to that man not so unloly to you that the Holy Spirit's standing there above you and angels all around you. He said, "Is that right, brother Brandham?" The Bible said so. And the angels of God are encamped about them. They don't go to heaven &gt;&gt; back to heaven. &gt;&gt; He says they go with you. &gt;&gt; They're sent on a mission &gt;&gt; to watch over you on life's journey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Last quote. We close the service. Thursday morning. We're getting ready to pick up brother Kyre. Getting all ready. Joanne's getting all the uh wares and everything. all our clothes, all our bedding ready for camp. I said, "I got I I'll run in and get Brother Kyre. I'll I'll run in and get Brother Cadre and I'll pick them up at the airport. Raining, pouring rain, and Joanne was left at home. And I've got I've got I've got the the meetings on my mind. I got you young people on my heart. Ah, God, would you come down? Would you speak in an unusual way? you've already been moving and all we want is a greater move of God and you're pondering these things and I wonder if I'm going to get the airport on time. I maybe left it a little bit late and I try a shortcut and I go down a certain road by the berry farms and I get on the King George Highway and they're working all over uh doing building the shoulders and you know how they got those big orange uh pylons and they've moved all everything over and and and I'm going down the road and I'm just thinking I got to get Brother Kyre and God help me to keep under the limit. That's probably one of my biggest weaknesses. I've got to get myself a four-cylinder, but I got to get there. And that's the kind of guy I am. And I want to get there. I hate being late. Going down the road. And the yellow line is moved. And I'm way over in the left lane. And the pylons are there. And I'm going, did I miss a lane here? I should be over on the other side. Here comes this Mercedes man. He's coming as fast as I'm going. And I'm going, well, I guess that's it. And then a little quote came by my way. The angels do not leave. &gt;&gt; They camp about them that fear God. &gt;&gt; I looked at that Mercedes. I figured this is it. I don't know how we got left and I don't know how I got right. But I went down that road singing to the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Is he real? &gt;&gt; To me, he's real. But that's not it. My little sweetheart's at home. She's working around the house and at the same time I'm going through this. God has put her into prayer saying, "Lord, bless the camp. Bless brother Cyra. Watch over my husband on the road." &gt;&gt; I say, "God is in the midst of his people at Cain." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Does he know where you are? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Can you overcome? I have already overcome. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're these are things saints of God you read back in the days of old. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; How's your believing? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To God be the glory. &gt;&gt; Great things he has done. Musicians, why don't you come? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Kadesh Barnea at Kadesh Barnea. covenant people. This covenant people, Israel, down in Egypt on account of disobedience and selling of their brother Joseph &gt;&gt; and was taken down into Egypt and was there 400 years under bondage. But I want you to notice they never lost their covenant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They lost their freedom. &gt;&gt; Not their covenant. And when God made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he swore by himself that he would save Abraham and his seed after him. God's duty bound to keep that promise. &gt;&gt; He's just as duty bound to you on that promise as he was to Abraham on his journey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right. Because you're Abraham's seed. How do you become Abraham's seed? You're dead in Christ and you take on Abraham's seed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Bible says, "And then you're heir according to that promise." &gt;&gt; That God's just as duty bound to you as he was to Abraham. Say that would take all the scare out of it. God don't want you scared of nothing. &gt;&gt; Rest solemnly upon what he has said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the good times, &gt;&gt; praise his name. &gt;&gt; In the bad times, &gt;&gt; do the same. And in everything, &gt;&gt; let's stand and give him the glory. &gt;&gt; In the good times [music] in everything, give him thank. [music and singing] Just give him [music] everything [music] [music] in the just praise [music] his name and in the baptism. [music] to the [singing] in [music and singing] the king of all. Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Give me just [singing] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music and singing] [music] &gt;&gt; everything. [music] [singing] Let's do it one more time as we get ready to close. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] Yeah. [music] Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] [music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have we got a lot to thank him for tonight? [music] &gt;&gt; We certainly do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is he still the same? &gt;&gt; He is absolutely the same. &gt;&gt; As we said on Wednesday night as the young people were coming, &gt;&gt; what is the attraction on the mountain? [music] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham took that that subject. What is the attraction on the mountain? He said it was God &gt;&gt; fulfilling his word. [music] &gt;&gt; So you say, well then what is this been happening around us? What is this great attraction that's going on? I want to say to you, it's God &gt;&gt; fulfilling his word. Once again, [music] &gt;&gt; brother Brennham takes John the Baptist as brother Bisll was saying about John this morning and he's standing in the River Jordan and he's baptizing and the different ones had come to see him's baptism and they said, "Are are are you the Christ?" And brother Bram said, "No." Oh, he just pointed himself back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the voice &gt;&gt; of him that crith in the wilderness, &gt;&gt; prepare ye the way of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; He knew who he was. He knew he was Isaiah 40 fulfilled. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there was a time then when Jesus came to Jordan to be baptized. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram says a wonderful thing. It says a change then from the prophet &gt;&gt; Yes. [music] &gt;&gt; to his prophecies. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you, there's a prophet that came today. &gt;&gt; And he's prophesied. &gt;&gt; There will be a super church. &gt;&gt; There will be a super race. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] And it's turning from the prophet to the prophecy. &gt;&gt; What is the attraction? God fulfilling that prophesied word again. &gt;&gt; And how did they overcome? by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. [music] &gt;&gt; What is their testimony? Jesus lives. &gt;&gt; Where does Jesus live? &gt;&gt; He's living in me. He's living in you. Keep that testimony high, young people. &gt;&gt; You speak positive. &gt;&gt; And as as many as believed him &gt;&gt; Yeah. gave he them &gt;&gt; power &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe? &gt;&gt; How's your believing? &gt;&gt; Very great tonight. &gt;&gt; Go in this thy might. &gt;&gt; Go in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Be strengthened [music] by thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Do not go by your feelings. You go by the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; By this message, [music] &gt;&gt; by your testimony, &gt;&gt; you watch God come behind it. The same way he vindicate that prophet, he'll vindicate [music] the word of God in you. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise him. &gt;&gt; We thank him tonight. &gt;&gt; That he is a living savior. &gt;&gt; That I can say tonight through song, he lives. He lives. Christ Jesus lives in me. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing now. I [music] serve a risen savior. [singing] [music] I know that he is [music] living. Whatever men may say, I see his hand [music] of mercy. I hear his voice. [music] Yeah. Heat. [music] [music] Oh, [singing] heat, [music] [music] heat. [singing] [music] Yeah. [singing] [music] Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. [singing] [music] [music] Heat.

Do you believe that? I know you believe that [applause and music] we're going to have church. All right. &gt;&gt; Are we having church? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I'd be like Brother Diggs in a minute. Preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's so much here. Yes. &gt;&gt; So much here for us &gt;&gt; to enjoy. &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, we go home and you'll go to Tim Hortons, you have a McDonald's coffee, and &gt;&gt; don't you love the presence of God? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why don't you have your seats? Michael, would you like to come and sing that song again? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [applause and music] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Biscll has asked, and I think it's it's worthy of it. We've got the time, don't we? &gt;&gt; There's many young people that came up and gave [music] testimony on Wednesday night, but maybe there's 10 of you that haven't yet, [music] and you say, "I know I got delivered. &gt;&gt; I know Jesus Christ, the word of God, delivered me." &gt;&gt; And you want to give testimony tonight? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Before the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Say, "God met me in a supernatural way." &gt;&gt; And why don't you just get yourself ready cuz we're going to have 10 testimonies. &gt;&gt; Something burning in your heart. You can't keep it quiet [music] &gt;&gt; that you know you've got a testimony. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're going to enjoy the presence of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Sing the verses too if you want to. Absolutely. Amen. [music] It's not hard to believe. Standing on the mountain [music] tops of glory. [music] Ooh, [singing] when you can hear the songs of angels and a breeze [music] from heaven send your spirit so real. [singing and music] Oh, but in [singing] the valley once more, [music] would Jesus still be Lord? That's the question. Cuz [music] believing when believing isn't easy [music] that isn't testing [music] cuz I need faith [singing] for the time when the sun doesn't [music] shine and the mountain top is just a memory. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When there's a sign [singing] to receive and [music] do [singing] my way [music and singing] when tr [singing] my way understand [music] what he Oh, that's and nothing [singing] else will see [music] and believe. [music] Oh, it's not hard [singing] to believe, but things are going well [music and singing] and skies are sunny. [music] Oh, when [singing] you feel you're making progress and doing [music] good, living in [singing] a time of plenty. [singing] Oh, but [music] if all that should change, will you still keep [singing] the faith? That's the question. [music] Cuz believing [music] when living [singing] is easy. Oh, that is [music] to see. Oh, [singing] what [music] I need for the time when the sun [music and singing] doesn't shine and a mountain top is just a memory. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; for me when my [music and singing] understand [music] and [music] believe it becomes my victory. Let it be an act of tonight [music and singing] is [music and singing] just [music and singing] when I go into [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; And I just don't understand. That's [music] where nothing else will do. It'll always see me through [music] and believe [singing] it become my victory. One more time. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When the sun has &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It's just a me. [music] Oh, and there and [music] [singing] [music] only [music and singing] when troules come my [singing] way. I just don't understand [music] what I mean. We bless you. That's when [music] nothing else see. And [music] believe it becomes. [music] [applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; Have your seats. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said there's 10. You might want to get up here. Um, [snorts] let's see. Uh, I guess when when I was riding down to the camp with brother Isaac Hegamman, he asked me what I was what I was expecting from camp and didn't quite know how to answer him, but all I all I could say I said only one thing I know it's going to be better than last time and that's that's pretty amazing cuz every time it's just [snorts] blows me away. And uh yeah, it sure was. Um, I guess guess there's probably a lot I could say, but I won't say too much. Um, on Friday night, well, Thursday night's meeting, I I was it really really spoke to me. I just just really in a a deep way. I I just love love that just to hear about love and God's love and how amazing it is and what it's doing in my life and each one of your lives as I see you grow closer to him and one to another as a family. And um but Friday night was kind of different. Um, I didn't even really expect to kind of come to like I don't know, I guess I didn't really expect myself to go to the altar, but somehow I just felt kind of smitten in my heart some of the things he was saying. And and so I went up and um when he prayed with me, I know John Curry's uh sure you all know he's a really good friend of mine and we talk sometimes and he says, "You know, Tim, one of the things I think you're the only thing you're going to ever have to struggle with is like mental battles." And it's true like not really many things matter to me in life, but just God, family, and friends basically. It's all I really care about. But um so things like usually it doesn't don't really bother me, but just mental struggles have been kind of a big thing for me and and that's what I was going up there about. And uh and he prayed with me and that's what he prayed for. He he prayed that the Lord would deliver me from these mental battles. And um and brother Tim Dodd came a little while after and prayed and also prayed that the complexes would go away. And so I just I accepted that. And &gt;&gt; so I'll give the God the glory. [applause] &gt;&gt; So we didn't really get to go to camp because I can't cross down yet, but I will be able to soon. But we did stream them and um it was first of all so amazing to see all the young people especially some of the young guys that Phil and I been praying for and Phil students. It was really moving for us. Um, but I think that what what was really God worked in me is faith for my family because seeing all the young people here and then um, Brother Matthew, I don't remember his name, his last name and his family. Uh, she's &gt;&gt; you. Huh? &gt;&gt; Desmond. &gt;&gt; Desmond. Is that their last name? &gt;&gt; How last camp he stood up and was beating the the thing. I don't remember. It's called the punching bag. So, um I don't know. God's been really giving me faith for them and believing because I don't know. It's I I I sort of felt like I lost the burden a little bit cuz I hadn't seen any um interest. They didn't have any interest and it was just sort of hard cuz being the only one. But God's really been helping me with that. And my dad's been actually streaming the services every Sunday. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, and and actually just a little testimony for him is um he he'd only heard Brother Biscllow cuz he just recently started and Brother Briscoll went for a while. So, brother Tom took a Sunday morning service and um it was the one that he just mentioned about the the journey and my dad's a poet or yeah, he loves writing poetry and um so on I don't know like Thursday or Friday or something. He wrote this poem and on Sunday, brother Tomt totally just preached about it about he just um what he wrote about. So, I don't know. It's that really did something for him. and he was pretty moved and he was like, "Whoa." So anyway, just keep praying for them cuz they're coming and if God can do it for the young people here, he can do it for my for my family. So anyway, [applause] &gt;&gt; thank you. God bless you all. Uh I'm not a young uh I'm not single. I'm married. But uh the reason why I'm here it's some God have been doing things uh kind of different way for me and uh this is not a past testimony but it's something that even happened this morning. Uh I think many of you remember that on Wednesday brother Tom read my email and uh that email actually I wrote it I was I was praying and coming out of prayer. I thought I should send the email and uh I sent the email to brother brother John Andy's and copy to you. I don't remember if I did it to brother Ed but I think I did. But anyways, there's some word that really stuck with me when I was praying was the ministry is being vindicated. It's humble and it's a blessed ministry. &gt;&gt; So uh since brother Tom read that email then the devil start fighting with me. I did not even share this with my wife. I kept it secret and I was just praying. I knew it was a devil and I was hustled away with from a different way. But anyways, uh the devil was telling me that the ministry is not vindicated. It's like wow, how would you say such a thing? But anyways, I keep praying praying and I knew for sure it was a devil because I know when the devil talks to me and I also when God talks to me. But there's few things that I've been uh pondering on and studying. One of them was I was in uh Luke Luke 7:11. I think you all remember the with a woman who had a a young man who was dead and then Jesus came away and it's just been a great great subject to me. I've just been pondering about it and praying and just was I've been rejoicing in it. And then when I finish then I start reading the next part that start which shows that the disciple of John the Baptist went and when they saw that they went and report to John and John went sent them back two disciple said you ask him is he the one or should I wait for another one then I'm start think I'm like well the Bible said Jesus had compassion for this woman that's why he raised her son but here is John the Baptist who was even the prophet, how would not God have compassion for him and living in prison and just send him with the word? No, they should see what happened and go report to him. So in other words, they would just bring a testimony which was the word of God many manifest in that time and taking back to John. So I've been pondering on that and just praying. I'm like, God, what is this? And then uh somehow I listened to one of the message. I don't remember exactly what that was, but it shows how Elijah was on Mount Caramel and all the great things he did. And then from there on just a little woman Jezebel who was not even in the presence of God the sinner just a way that she said that she want Elijah's life and this is a great man who was in the presence of God and just start running away from this little woman and then trying to see where to hide and end up in the juniper tree. So I've been pondering about that. God what is happening exactly? Then I start putting that together with the camp. I'm like, well, we've been hiding. Now, we're on the juniper tree, and we still have to go in the cave, which the Bible says uh Elijah went down in the cave and uh hide there. That's where the angel of the Lord came and met him and give him a bread for the rest of his journey. And I'm like, we need the bread of life now. We need Christ. We need the word after the experience that we had. Then Saturday, which was yesterday, I'm coming. I wanted to help the school. So I'm having this thought going through my mind. The ministry is not vindicated. How is that? So I go in the building. So the first thing, Brother Kim Dingle, I don't know if he's here, but he saw me and turn around say, "Oh, brother Edd's here. He's going to help you." I'm like, "Oh man." So I got brother Eddie start to help me. And I kind of move fast and it's kind of slowing me down a little bit. So, I'm trying trying to see how I could switch, but I heard something that I knew for sure this is a man of God. So, I start and then brother Ed move went to do something and grab a big hammer, start like smashing the concrete and I run to him like, "Aren't you preaching tomorrow?" He's like, "Yeah, I am." I'm like, "You shouldn't be here. What you doing here? It's a hard work. You got to be going. Somebody else can do this." But at the same time this is thought these thoughts still coming back in my mind. The main street is not vindicated. So I said God you gave me one sign and only one say I've been pondering about Elijah and I've been ponder by John the Baptist. So let's when today whoever will come and preach I want him to say and stay on the same thought that I've been pondering on. And then brother Ed came and say uh let's open Matthew. I'm like, "Oh, Matthew." Because I was in Luke. So, he read about John the Baptist. I'm like, "Oh, wow." So, he keep preaching, keep preaching. Then when brother Ed is preaching, I'm keep following him. I'm like, "Right now, he's going to speak about Elijah." And as soon as I finish those word, he goes, "And Elijah." And all my sister said, "Oh my goodness." So, it just became surreal to me. After they called for the people to come at the altar, I couldn't help myself. But I had a little note. I'm just going to share one with you. Uh so you don't make you think don't think I'm making this up. [clears throat] So uh when people were praying, I came up and show a little bit to brother Ed because I'm like, you know, the devil, you never know. I'll go talk to him afterwards. Like that kid just wrote that when I was writing when I was thinking about it. So I get that quickly here. &gt;&gt; Uh sorry. You &gt;&gt; want me to help you find it? &gt;&gt; It's okay. I have a note. Okay. Here. &gt;&gt; He brought this note up and read it to me this morning and and he's got in there that Monday is is the preacher's juniper tree. So I had it on my note. I said uh I was thinking about going to study on Mount Carmel Jinper Tree and the cave. So but on these few things that really stuck in my heart and I said every pastor after after having a good service Monday morning the devil will wait on him with the journey. And I said there's many of us under the juniper tree wondering ourselves sometimes. Oh God, &gt;&gt; who? Oh God, I was writing fast. I can't even read my own writing. Oh God, what do you want me to do? God has to do something for every man that comes under the jourer tree &gt;&gt; or he will break in pieces. God knows your trials. He knows all about it. And after all, God came in a small voice. And uh this I'm talking about how God came to Elijah. And God came in a small voice and not in a big things. Big things are just a forerunners of God. God knows where you are. God sent an angel Elijah and gave him a bread, a bread of life. And this is the bread of life that we need. So once again, I want to say to you people, my email is real and I believe it. God bless you. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Um, I just believe God answered my prayer at camp and Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday morning, Saturday night, Sunday morning. It was all like really good. read the testimonies at the snows and I just can't get enough of it. [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Uh I found my joy at camp or God gave me my joy back. That's what I had lost. Um but I really found that joy &gt;&gt; joy comes from like listening to the word, right? And it's amazing because for my entire life I've barely listened to the message. I came to church. But in the first I put a CD in my car, right? In the first 10 minutes, I heard so many things that these brothers have preached their whole lives. But it's it was made to me because I people wonder sometimes, you know, what's the ministry saying? Is it really the word? and but it's really because they're not in the message and they haven't heard it and that's why they question the message that the ministry is preaching. Uh so it was a reality reality to me. Another thing is also uh at campus specific thing that brother Cadre sniffed out. Uh he was just preaching along right and we get those tithe statements right from the church and I realized I'd paid 5% for 2010. Uh and it had been bothering me, right? cuz I I thought I always paid my tithes, but I only paid five. So, he was just preaching and then he just brings up tithes so randomly. And then he said, "You're" He said, "You're cursed if you don't pay your tithe." And then he said, also the the line that got me that was straight to me was he said, "You don't pay your tithe and you wonder why you have car problems every check." And that that was really right here cuz that happens. But that was just uh really that was the most personal I have ever had something speak to me. Uh and then brother uh Gary St. John, I just wanted to thank him. I don't think he's here today. He is here today. Okay. Um on Saturday night, I didn't pray with many people. I prayed with two people. And um the second one was brother Gary. And I just went over there and put my arm around him and prayed. And he had had me on his heart. he was saying and how he told the Lord to just send me to him and and that's what happened. I just went and we prayed together and that was it was great. So, [applause] &gt;&gt; first of all, I just want to thank the Lord for all he did in our family this um year, &gt;&gt; this past camp. It was just amazing and all my prayers he just answered and I'm just thankful for that. But um I went into camp with two specific things on my heart. Like I had many different things but I came to the prayer meetings before both the prayer meetings and I prayed um I wanted my joy back because yeah I didn't have it. I lost it like this last year. And then um also for my temper cuz I had a temper and I don't know I work as a cashier it and the people always seem to just pull it out of me. So I just pray for that cuz I I know that people watch you in the world and in your work and I didn't want to be a bad um example to them. So then when I came to the services, Brother Kyre spoke um every service he seemed to hit on getting your joy back. And I was like, "That's mine because I've been praying for this." And um he said um you can get it back because you once had it so you can search for it. And I just I claimed that. And then and I did get my joy back. I'm very happy. And then another quick thing about my temper. So then I went to work and I was praying about it. And I was like, did it really happen or did I just think it happened? And um my boss was giving me this evaluation of the year to see how good I did. And then when we were in there and um just this last week, like right after camp and then we're sitting in the in the office and he's like, "Well, um customer service or whatever came up." I was like, "Oh, no." But and he was like, "Well, you just have to I think some something that you have to work on." And he's like, "Is your when you get mad," he's like, "You frown or whatever for the whole day." And so I was like, "Yeah, well, I tried to tell him that it wasn't going to be like that anymore." And then but he just kept talking. I was like, "Okay." So I just sat there and then he he paused. And then a little while later he was like, "Um, but since you've come back," he's like, "I've noticed a huge change in you." And I was like, "Oh." And then I was like, "Yeah, well I I just wanted to tell him more." And then he was like just sitting there shaking his head. Yes. And then um he's like, "You don't think we watch you." He's like, "But I watch you and I've noticed a change in you." So I just wanted to give the Lord all the glory for everything he's done for me and [applause] my family. [applause] I'm awful without notes, but So this week has been uh interesting. I've been really sick, but I figured that all of us, lots of people have been getting sick. It's an epidemic of sickness, but it's an epide epidemic of victories also because we all got obviously something very special and he wants to take that all away right away after camp. You know, everyone just gets sick. But um so last night I I've been feeling really sick and I before bed, you know, I'm just like I'm sick of this. And so it was the first time I've got actually felt the presence in my room. And so I got down on the floor and just laid there and I'm like I need this to be taken away. But so I went to bed and then I woke up and I figured well I'd had a really really bad dream. And so I woke up and I was sweating and my blankets were everywhere and I was just I figured it was because I had gotten down and prayed for that long. And and so also at camp, mom before we left, she had told dad that she he better get ready cuz Nathan was going to come back with the Holy Ghost and he was like, "Wow." So, um I never thought of my brother that he could ever have the Holy Ghost cuz he was he wanted to beat everybody up and I was the little runt of the family and he just beat me up. But so I I never figured, you know, what he would be like if he had the Holy Ghost. So I never even thought to pray for him or anything like that. But so we get to camp and then he texted mom on Saturday night late late and he said that he got filled up and drunk and so it was crazy. And this week he's been different and he's been actually praying with meaning instead of repeating his prayer the same every night. And um I think that's all but I'm really really happy and everything and yeah thank you. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Um well Brianna stole everything I was going to say but um well before camp I go into camp and I'm thinking who am I going to hit? Who am I going to hit? boxing, pillow fight, anything. So, I get to the camp and I'm wondering who I'm going to who's on my hit list. So, I go up to my cabin and who's there for me to unleash upon. So, I get there and okay, there's not really anybody fun to hit there. And so, I was [clears throat] kind of in a I was kind of grumpy the whole camp or first part of camp. In the first service, I didn't really understand what was going on. I didn't really pay attention. And the next night, Friday night, um it was that was it kind of hit home. So, I just went up to the front and then that was a night where I got filled. And then the next night was kind of a confirmation for that. And then so it was the rest of camp it was really um kind of um yeah the whole the rest of the sermons are really confirming that and doing that. And then Sunday my mom during the prayer came over and told me to come up and pray with brother Diggs. I'm like oh no I don't want to really want to go up to the front in front of everyone. And so my mom drags me up there and so we pray and then that was the real and grand slam of convers or confirmation. And so um the ever since then at night I kind of read my Bible and prayed and listened to part of a sermon and I had never read a bi my Bible or prayed or listened to any sermon on my own. Never. So it was it's been a real change since then. And yeah, camp was really good. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Um uh my camp experience really started before camp um during the prayer meetings and the first one was really good cuz like everybody was praying but the second one it was like the Holy Spirit come down and like everybody was praying like everybody was worshiping and if it was it was like the one of the hardest times I've ever prayed. And this camp wasn't really especially for me. I was mostly praying for like other people like my brother and like all those other guys his age. And then um Thursday night the th Yeah. Thursday night um when he was talking about love of God. It was really um something that I was wondering about like how deep did God's love go? And then Friday night was when I went up for prayer. And then brother Diggs came up to pray for me and he said, um, Lord, fill her up with the Holy Ghost so much that she can't contain it. And that's when I like totally gave my life to God. And then, um, uh, Saturday night that that was more of like just pray for everybody else. And just to see like God just like confirm like himself like in everybody like in Ellie and then like Matthew and Josh who I've been praying for for like a long time. And then um it was really amazing just to see the way like God can just come down and totally take over a service cuz I I was listening I was listening to Saturday evening um a couple days ago and brother Digs said um something like uh I wonder if God can just come down and just make this preacher stop preaching and just like God can totally change the service. And then and then I was like wow like like a few minutes later that actually happened and it was really amazing to see that in like in just a service and it was really changed for me like that kind of experience. Yeah. God bless you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Um, I want to thank Sister Darlene and my mom Christy for our for being our counselors. And sister Darlene shared the scripture with us. It was Jude 24:25. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. to the only wise God our savior. Be glory and majesty, dominion, power, both now and ever. Amen. &gt;&gt; And um there's Sterling got us these notebooks and she told us to write down three things that we expected out of camp. And so I wrote down a few and I believe all of those expectations were met. And it spoke to me in the service when um Brother Diggs, he was talking about don't be ashamed to say you have the Holy Ghost. And so after that service, um, I was talking with Victoria and then so I told her and then she told me that she had it too. And I was just really happy and I felt freer. And also I it spoke to me when brother Digs said that don't wait for someone else to start the way of the Holy Spirit. You start it. And I'd like been like struggling with that before he said that. And so and yeah, just thank you for all those who made camp possible. And [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; hey, Phil, &gt;&gt; uh first of all, just like to say a big thank you uh to those brothers and sisters uh involved in the streaming. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I've never been so thankful for streaming ever. &gt;&gt; Um to to know that that was going on just a little ways from where we are and it was current at that moment. Um, I borrowed a projector from school and we had it on our our wall and uh, we were there worshiping with with you all and it was just uh, it was an amazing experience especially that Saturday night when things just kind of let loose &gt;&gt; and um, I I nudged Katie cuz she was just worshiping. And I said, "Look," you know, cuz I had been watching the monitor and I'd seen, you know, Matthew's arm like this and that, you know, the video just zoomed right into it and it was just like this and he was struggling as as you were praying for him. And and um and then I looked again and uh and there he was with his hands up and worshiping and I nudged Katie and I said, "Look, that's Matthew. That's Ellie, you know, doing this and that's that's, you know, Josh." and just pointing out the different ones. And that meant so much to me. Um I see the you know I get to teach some of these guys and um to see them like that uh that just meant so much to me. So much to me and knowing that the next day or two days I guess on the Saturday night on Monday I'd get to come to school and see the change. And um there was a change. And honestly, I mean, I took one look at Matthew and there wasn't like the the cloud or this mask. It was just it was the old Matthew. I remember the old Matthew. And so, and I saw that right away. And I look into Ellie's eyes and it's the same just like a like it's gone, you know? And it's it's amazing. And in I teach 8, nine, and 10 mostly. And um in those grades, camp's been they've been talking about camp all week. You know, it's been keep on coming up. I remember talking to to Nathan in the classroom and even when the conversation kind of went, you know, towards the snowboarding trip or something like that, it somehow come back to the camp services and it it's just been a theme and it's uh you know, we're praying that it'll continue. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. [applause] Go ahead. &gt;&gt; That's 12. &gt;&gt; 12 for the 12 disciples. &gt;&gt; Well, camp experience has just carried on. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; It's been wonderful. &gt;&gt; And the prayer meeting, Monday night, Saturday night was wonderful. But we can't let it stay at Saturday night, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We need to carry on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We're driving home. I was driving home with Aaron Hardy, John Kerr, Tim Girtson, and brother David Dertie. And we dropped Tim off at his house cuz he had homework. And then we dropped David off at his house. But we we would pray with each one as they left. And when we ca when we stopped at my house, it was just beautiful. God came down in so such a special way. Came down the same power he became Saturday night. &gt;&gt; It's just &gt;&gt; beautiful to remain in his presence. &gt;&gt; And then also Friday night and prayer meeting same power. Glory. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; The promise is unto you &gt;&gt; and to your children and to your children's children. Amen. Just give me your hand. Let's agree together as we close.

[applause] I have to say just two things. Keep it down to two things. Number one, when Brother Tim becomes a teacher at that school, I want to be in his classroom. I mean it. I'm reenrolling. I said anybody that has brother Tim for a teacher, that'll be a great day. &gt;&gt; Another thing, I appreciate [music] Brother John Andes. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] Hallelujah. [applause] Amen. The Lord must love us very much. [applause] Amen. We appreciate you, brother John. I have not worked with somebody that's so willing &gt;&gt; every day &gt;&gt; at any time. &gt;&gt; He just doesn't say it. He lives it. &gt;&gt; And I feel a privilege to be able to labor with such a soldier at the cross. &gt;&gt; And he's a love gift to us. &gt;&gt; And you know, I I wouldn't want to be saying that at a funeral. I'll say that anytime. I'll give a man a bouquet anytime. I appreciate him and I appreciate his family &gt;&gt; and I appreciate the [music] work of grace within his life. Brother John, would you come and close us in a word of prayer? &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, the grapes from the promised land are good, Lord. So appreciate, Lord, that Joshua and Caleb spirit that's among us, Lord, that we're able to inherit our land with our children and our loved ones and the older ones, Lord, waving that banner of victory and the testimony of [music] Jesus Christ still lives on. Lord, we're just so happy, God. We've been reveling in the glory of God among us. Just seems like whenever it comes up, Lord, we can't say enough. Just a few words and that presence comes near. Lord, would you come into our homes, God? Come into our lives in a greater way. Just continue this work, God. Let let the quality of your spirit be increased in our families, in our lives individually, and in our marriages, for our children, in our assembly. It's just so wonderful to see the glory of God all around us and hearing your word, God. and it's nothing but the truth. And to see the prophecy for this day coming to pass. Lord, it's so wonderful. We just feel like the next step could be into our new bodies, into that other dimension where we'll never, never, never end around your throne and be dancing and shouting and giving testimonies. God, truly, this is the presence of Jesus Christ. Lord, we pray healing for every life. It is true. Satan has tried to come in and afflict Lord uh one another, but we're just holding the banner of the word. Nothing can steal away what you've done for us. We'll keep confessing it. We'll keep uh putting it back into Satan's mind. He's going down and we're going up. We're going up in the first resurrection and the rapture call one morning and the change of our bodies. It'll be a wonderful day, God. This is just a foretaste, just a down payment, God. And if and if this is that, Lord, what's a new body going to be like? We'll be shouting for thousands and millions of years of your glory, God. Lord, if there's anything today at the end of this day, in the closing moments of this day, as the family is about ready to part, Lord, that we'd like to see you working in individual lives and hearts. May it continue, Jesus. continue your work, God, and don't let up, Father. Continue your love and your mercy, Jesus. We appreciate the men of God that's labored for us, Lord, and the sisters and those among us behind the scenes. We just so appreciate the body of Christ. May you go with them tonight and encourage every life along this pilgrim journey that it's not over yet, Lord. There's still battles to be won and victories. Amen. &gt;&gt; May you go with us now, Lord, and bring precious fruit and sheaves, Lord. And those on the internet, Lord, we never forget them, Lord. May the same Holy Ghost anointing that's been among us go out across the waves and cross the miles, God, and visit individual churches and families and lives. And let them also wave, Lord, a banner of victory, victory, victory. For we're part of a body of Jesus Christ. Go with us now, God. We love your appearing. Go with us now. And your grace is upon us. In the name of Jesus Christ, we thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Greet one another. You're dismissed. Amen. God be with you this week. &gt;&gt; Sure. One last thing. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I said two. We have three. Uh I [music] wonder can you put that up on the screen? The brothers, brother Biscll requested [music] and I and it's just a burden. Do you see what God is doing and put it before the people? Missions &gt;&gt; outreach &gt;&gt; and brother Michael, brother John, and a group of young men and young ladies have got together to write up testimonies. We've [music] got them broken down in countries and uh local uh ministry, local assembly, different ones. They'll have their testimony from camp. You don't want to miss that page. And and then if you want to support, there's a place where you can support to see this message go out. It's a great um [music] page that the brothers have put together. Brother Michael put a lot of work together. Aaron, they've all done a great job. It's been a body ministry and it they've all come together to put this up. I'll rush home and we'll all put it on and look at it. There's some wonderful articles and you can't keep up with it. &gt;&gt; Right. Brother Murphy was having a China report and I said, "Brother Murphy, what about those ones that Brother Ivan was talking about?" He says, "It's already gone on from that." &gt;&gt; So, you'll want to go read that every day and see what God is doing. He's doing great things. &gt;&gt; We thank God for the different ones in the body that can put this up to get this message out and around the world. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God be with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; God. [music] &gt;&gt; [music]
