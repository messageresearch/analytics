[Music] &gt;&gt; Just a quick note, the children are going to sing some songs for you this morning that are old, that are familiar, probably international. I'll tell you why after. [Music] I got it.

[Music] Lord of you. [Music] Lord of you Lord. Oh me Lord. Oh you Lord oh do you remember me? [Music] [Applause] Well, another year has uh gone by. And um just to mention the the reason for the old and familiar songs is because this year the Sunday school offering I know we every year we try to dedicate the offering to a specific type of project. It's a missionary offering for sure. And um I sound like I'm inside a 45gallon drum. the um ah better the uh uh when I was in the Ukraine for instance uh a couple years ago uh a lot of the Russian believers were asking me because I'm the Sunday school superintendent here uh how to efficiently set up a Sunday school how should it be put together who should teach and it um it came to me that you know a lot of the reason for the questions is because they don't have that portion of the message translated into their language so therefore they don't have that the prophet's instructions on that. Uh and of course then they're basing it on their former teachings. So and brother Tony has been asked the same kind of questions as well while he's been overseas. So we decided to couple together uh and in concert with Bible believers to produce a um a Sunday school manual so that would be translated in various languages. So that's where we targeted things this year. Um, one thing as well though, there are ongoing things that are taking place. This is really bad. Maybe this is better. This is much better. Okay. Um, anyway, little things add up. Uh, brother Mike G's class has for the last couple of years taken on the burden to um uh to give the children uh a little view, something that they can do to try to make a difference. And and that's really uh what it's all about. I I don't know how many of you can remember the challenge I popped to the young people a few years ago that if they simply matched the amount of money they spent on coffee or slurpees or whatever it is they do after a service just four Sundays out of a year um they could completely cover my budget for uh for shipping to the Ukraine and Siberia um really simply. So it's just little things that add up to make a large amount when everybody puts in. So brother Mike um where's sister charity? Sister Charity, you want to grab the poster? And they, of course, put together little bottles and cans, and each one's worth a nickel. And uh their nickels this year come up with uh over,400,467 message books to be printed in the Congo. Now, I'm going to get Brother Daniel if he'll grab the the bullet box. Brother Biscll, you don't have to lift this. Sister Amy has the envelope. If you want to come forward, you can read the Sunday school. Uh, these kids don't know what the word decrease means. I'll put it to you that way. Brother Bisl can read you the totals on the floor. Be better. It's heavy. &gt;&gt; Missionary offering. The children of Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday School wish to present their missionary offering for the year 2006. This offering is $78066 Canadian and $331.91 US for a combined total of $1,082.89. This year's offering has been dedicated to the compilation, translation, and printing of a Sunday school manual to guide the development of Sunday schools for children in the saints of the saints around the world. Richard Drake on behalf of Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday School. God bless you, brother Richard. God bless you, children. Okay, children. We came in nice and orderly. Let's do the same. Here we go. Brother Tony, where do you want the box? &gt;&gt; In the office. Okay. Let's sing together. Uh in Jesus name, we press on. We press on. Somebody maybe want to come up here and uh fix this thing. Richard, you you might want to spend some quality time with your brother John. [Music] In Jesus name we press on [Music] in Jesus name. We press on. We press on and on. Oh, with the bright clear before our eyes, we find the strength to press on. Sin against Jesus name. We press on. We press on in Jesus name. We press on. We press on dear Lord. with the prize here before our eyes. [Music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Isn't it grand to see all those young people and children? Just so wonderful. When I look at a group like that, I can't help but think about uh you know, where's it all going to be four or five years down the road? And then what, you know, what's what are we going to do with camp? And what are we going to do with uh whole lot of things? What are we going to do with school? And God God is going to have to make a way for us. Amen. I'm happy they're here. &gt;&gt; I'm happy they're not sitting watching some cartoons &gt;&gt; on television or something &gt;&gt; playing some video game or whatever more. Aren't we glad they're here? The atmosphere of the Holy Spirit. How thankful we are. We've got quite a few things I I want to go over before we actually get to the word tonight. Brother John Tay will be preaching and we have plenty of time. So, we're going to uh have the preliminaries as short as possible to give him all the time that he would need. Uh we're so thankful. I'm I'm glad we were able to see the work in in Ghana where our brother Taye is pastoring and uh not only myself but others here in the congregation I'm sure all of us but some to a larger degree were so thrilled on Wednesday night to see the messages which they have been pulling down off the internet and that will be important in a few minutes uh with some other comments that I have. But I want to make a announcement regarding the Sunday services. We are going to uh go to a one one service Sunday uh for the next two months. That's July and August. Uh we'll have just a morning service which will be at 10:30. And I know with some of you, you're disappointed and other others are perhaps feeling a mixed feelings about this. But this has not been a uh a sudden decision. I've I've made this uh I've had this uh in on my heart for over a year and we discussed it a year ago actually May with the deacons and then we just waited on the Lord. But now here are some of the things you see. You as individuals, you've got your own little circle to think about. I have the burden of the whole congregation. During the last during the last 15 years since we've been in this present church location, our congregation has tripled in the number of people. And a large percentage of the congregation back then when we first moved here, they were young couples, singles, and teenagers and much a much more mobile group of people than we have today. Presently, our families have grown, multiplied, and many of those that were teenagers 15 years ago, today they're now married, and they have their children and babies with also growing families. And this group is much less mobile than singles and young people and also empty nesters such as I and my wife who don't have any children, don't have any obligation that way. Family-wise, economics has required that an increasing number of our congregation of people, especially on this side of the border, have had to move further a field, further from the church, making traveling time very difficult and expensive, especially lately with the cost of fuel. It would shock you to know what some of our people are are paying just driving if you just take the time that they drive. And we can say that's a small sacrifice, but it is costly. And just to give you an idea, there's there's over 300 people that either cross the border or drive from a long distance, some an hour and over an hour away. over 300 of this congregation uh live uh either across the border or live quite some distance. Now, the number of people crossing the border has at least quadrupled, not tripled, but quadrupled since we've moved here into this church building. And crossing the border has become increasingly difficult, especially since 911. There's about 225 of the congregation across the border. One of our families last week spent one hour at the border crossing at Lyndon. One hour waiting to get across the border. Now others of families I know that they come with their children, have their lunch or prepare their dinner, sit in their vans and wait the afternoon and then come through the evening service. Now you folks on this side know nothing about that. You know nothing about having the little children tired and cranky and they spend for hours and hours in the church. All I say it it it is difficult and over years and years that has become increasingly difficult as we have a very very young congregation very young congregation percentage-wise and it's an unusually young congregation and we're trying to cope and deal with these things. Now the security problem at the border is not likely to go away anytime soon and may get worse before it gets better. We just don't know the border crossing. And the reason why we speak about we're just looking at uh at July and August is because now during holiday season the uh number of people crossing simply because it is holidays increases substantially and often makes the weight uh almost unbearable. There's one last thing. the increase in population just in the Pacific Northwest is making the border lineups a regular experience. If if I were you and you can afford it, I would certainly get a nexus if you don't have a nexus. Now I know also from speaking with many of you uh that are coming from the US side that in Sunday morning uh quite often the timing of the meetings is quite good as far as the tourists are concerned because you're generally coming to church and there isn't a lineup at that time but this was Sunday morning last week and the Lynen border has almost become as bad as any one of the others and it's been It's been quite a thing. Now the other the other aspect of this is this is not just to free up the Sunday. That's not the point. That's not even in the point. It is uh Sunday evenings would make it possible for two other types of meetings that are becoming actually three but two that are becoming increasingly important and one is that uh it would give us opportunity to have a special meeting for the young people who are still young and mobile and we could have uh we if brother Tom brother John feel to have something special for the young people during that time that would be a possibility. Number two, some of the assembly who have not had the opportunity to slip down to Seattle would be able to go down because every other Sunday we have a service in Seattle. Every Friday night and every other Sunday down in Seattle and of course the other thing that will still remain on Sunday evening is the Lord's table and communion and we will be having that in the next two months. So that will be one of the Sundays. So that's that is uh for for the next two months which is uh actually nine Sundays and that will be the our Sunday morning service will remain exactly the same at 10:30. So that's that announcement. Now I have another one that's going to take me a few moments. Uh and you you can just I'll sing of course. So we'll just wait. I'm going to announce today in July of 207, that's a year away, that uh Cloverdale Bible Way, the Lord willing, will host a international convention. This will be a different convention because it will not only be a convention where people will come here, but I am calling it an internet convention. And I felt very inspired about this some weeks ago. I've talked to just a few brothers and I'm going to be uh announcing some things in connection with this convention. It will commence on Sunday July 1 and will go for the entire week till July the 8th. And I want it to encompass all aspects of the ministry of not only the church but of the bride of Jesus Christ worldwide. There will be ministers and delegates from many countries around the world. And we expect representatives especially of those countries where God has allowed us to labor through the ministry of Bible believers, men of vision, who you've just heard brother uh brother Richard Drake speak of and the local church. It will be uh our church's 37th year of being here in in Cloverdale. And this convention will embrace all the various ministries of the bride of Jesus Christ in including but not limited to ministers within the five-fold ministry ministers who are active in outreach in their respective nations. translators and other workers responsible for the printing and distribution of the message and ministers meeting with special sessions for young emerging ministries. There will be ministers meeting for young emerging ministries and then there will be special meetings that will be directed to the youth. All of that will take place within the within the eight days of the convention. We may have uh the first two or three days given over to missions. You see, I have been to many conventions in my lifetime. And uh they bring brethren from many countries. And what's unfortunate is in a three or 4 day meeting, you only get to hear just a handful of those men. And I have seen where people have come from halfway around the world and never have an opportunity to even get behind the pullpit. And it will this will give us some time starting on Sunday and we'll perhaps give a Monday, Tuesday, and perhaps Wednesday morning to to missions. It'll be missions on a scale that you've not experienced for most of you. And then uh and the evening services will be like a regular convention service, special meetings probably going from Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. And then uh perhaps Thursday and Friday we'll have some uh special service in the daytime for the young people. And the evening service, say Friday night, will be uh directed to the young people perhaps with a minister that the Lord lays on our heart that will have something specially for them. And so it's I have thought about this for quite a long time. You can see it's quite uh quite uh uh I I have it quite settled in my mind what the Lord has laid on my heart. Now the reason I've called it internet convention is because where these ministers come from today we have brother Tay from Ghana. Now I would love to have brother Tay here at that convention and no doubt he will come but then their congregations are back. Ghana for example speaks English so they wouldn't even need an interpreter. And what we will do is we will encourage and we'll have someone in charge of internet service so that uh they will be connected in a high-speed uh line and have the have the all they need is a high-speed line, a projector and a giant screen and then their congregations can come and gather at various locations be it Norway or Africa or Zimbabwe or Ghana or or uh in in Congo, the Philippines, wherever more, we'll have time zones to deal with. But I've also looked into that and for example, all of Europe and Africa and so on, when we have a morning service, they'll have a lovely evening service, if they wish to tie in and see their own pastors participating. And furthermore, then uh I I expect that what we will do is have a a battery of uh some of our young skilled uh computer uh young people that can be at uh several computers and uh uh they're have their laptops at a at some location here in the church and uh say say example for a ministers meeting that may be taking place in the morning. This will be that's why I have it so announced so early so they can it can be arranged that the minister service that is taking place here in the morning ministers can be gathering at many different places around the world and they can text in we'll give them these addresses and they can text in their questions and have them answered by experienced brethren here in this country and text the answer right or they can hear it right back and text the question here. Are you getting my idea? And I think it's a a marvelous I I believe it's an inspired thought that God's given me. I don't know all the technology of it, but I I I see it's very simple and I believe it will work wonderfully. And as far as we're concerned, it'll be the first global internet convention that I know of taking place in the message. And I believe it's not just to do something first, but it will tie the believers together in a way that you've never had it before. We've never had it before. And I think it's wonderful. &gt;&gt; I want you to pray about it. You see, there are so many that would like to attend a convention of this nature, but are unable to. So they may have two or three people come from their country or from their church and the rest of them just sit at home and then when the pastor and the different ministers get home they tell them what happened. But won't it be so much better if they can sit there and watch it happen? And really there's not a huge cost to that. Really not a huge cost. uh a projector and a giant screen and if it can't be arranged from within the country then we and some some places are too poor to do it and so we are going to I'm announcing that as of today if you feel on your heart at some point in time in the next year I would like to contribute to the cost there's going to be very real costs to doing this and we have never put any pressure on this congregation in all of our 37 years and God has always wonderfully provided and to me abundantly provided. But if God puts it on your heart, I just want to let you know there will be some real costs because if the if a country and a church is too poor to provide themselves with a with a projector, then we'll get them one. I' I'd be happy to get them one so that whole congregation can enjoy this whole convention either live or and in many places we'll be able to have it live sometime when we're here in the evening. Some places they'll have to be meeting early in the morning like for a 7:30 meeting here they'll have to meet at like about 7 in the morning and that's great because a lot of the places a lot of those countries uh early morning meeting is nothing new to them. We'll be working in close contact with the pastors of these countries to arrange for these things to be set up. And then uh we are going to also be needing amongst our own assembly a tremendous amount of commitment and I envision setting up uh some that will be in charge of such areas as billeting. We'll need to bill it people. Uh we'll have someone in charge of transportation. We'll have someone in charge of the internet services and the and any technical questions that might come. We'll need people that are just plain in charge of uh questions regarding the uh convention. And uh I would like to say last but not least, pray for us to we'd like to maybe have another auditorium for the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. And if that doesn't happen, you know that we fill this church already. So I I envision removing the windows out of the back here. I know already that the air conditioning people said that's going to change everything. and the sound people are going to say because they've already told me that changes everything. But we're just going to have to work with it somehow. And uh and if we have to pack this place out, that's what we will we will be packing it out for sure. And also the fellowship room. So uh that is uh July 2007. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, oh Lord, my God and my redeemer. Amen. Let's just stand and we'll sing pleasing. Let me be pleasing to thee. Pleasing. Let me be pleasing to you. Everything [Music] you be [Music] [Music] pleasing. [Music] to you &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed. Our gracious and loving father. How we love you and we know Lord that you love us with an ever dying love, an unqualified love. We ask that today, Lord, our words, our thoughts, our plans may be pleasing to you. We want our lives to be in order, oh God. Pray that you'll bless the word today. Anoint us. Anoint me, Father. I'm thankful I'm able to stand here today, oh God. And I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll give you'll give uh utterance and you'll give good ground for the hearts of the people in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. I want to thank the congregation because I've gotten quite a few remedies from quite a few people for my throat. I just want to let you know I'm taking all of them. It's been a bit of a task, but I'm taking all of them. All right, let's turn to Matthew, please. And uh I'm watching my time because I've kept you through these announcements, but we need the word. &gt;&gt; Matthew, I'm sorry, the 12th chapter. And we're going to read what we read last week, only just two verses, 36 and 37. But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. This is really incredible. This is not saying by his word. It's by thy word. The only way you can be justified is you need to speak his word &gt;&gt; and that is part of your confession. &gt;&gt; Then in James uh the third chapter just one verse we could read I was going to read many verses here but I I want to conserve our time. The fifth verse, even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth. And then I'm reading Hebrews 3 and1. Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest of our profession, Jesus Christ. Consider the high priest of our profession. And the prophet said the same word, of course, and if you look it up, the same word is confession. The high priest of your confession. May God add his blessing to his word. As you have your seats, I want to say just immediately as soon as you can just gather your thoughts together and and I'll like to get directly to the subject. The the high priest of our profession. our profession which number one he said is to confess that's what the word profession is for you to confess and there are there are many meanings to it but the one that strikes me and the one that I have been very impressed with over a long period of time is to say the same thing as another &gt;&gt; to agree with I'm talking about an agreement that is completely your entire being is in agreement with what has been said or what has been revealed. Uh you and you then it's not just to have a mental ascent and a mental acceptance. It is to say the same thing so that the words of your mouth are in absolute agreement with God's thought. Now I have a question. How are we going to agree? How are we going to express the same thing as long as they as long as God's thoughts would remain a mystery &gt;&gt; or as long as they would remain sealed up in a symbol? &gt;&gt; God gives a symbol. this person assumes it means this and this man thinks it's this and that Bible teacher or whatever more and everybody's got a different concept. They got the white horse rider and one says it's the Holy Ghost and the next one says it's the devil. And who are you going to how are you going to agree if if it's not made known and then somebody might say it but and and they might be exactly right. But you still cannot agree with it because God has not confirmed it supernaturally. God has not vindicated it. So now you have to have a vindicated con a positively confirmed voice that God supernaturally stands behind and so that you know man can't do that. &gt;&gt; Man cannot do that. God has done that. Okay. Now when you find the mouthpiece that God has stood behind and unequivocally proved it's him, &gt;&gt; then you are under responsibility to heed that voice &gt;&gt; because now you have something to agree with. And if you hang back from that, then you're in serious trouble because God has gone to all the trouble of making known. And he takes his servants and his he takes his messengers and his prophets and brings them through incredible uh uh trial and preparation to prepare that vessel. Then he gets that vessel so he can set it aside. Then he speaks his word through it and confirms it with the supernatural right behind it in order. He's doing that for you. God's not doing that for his sake. God doesn't need that. You're the one that needs it. We're the people that were confused and God comes and confirms it. It just absolutely correct &gt;&gt; it precisely the truth. then we are under obligation to acknowledge this is God's mouthpiece &gt;&gt; and he speaks the words of God and so then we hear it and now you have something to agree with for the first time if God doesn't prove it like that you don't have to worry this man may be right that man may be right and you'll just have to you know settle my my when I get to an area like that or into a situation like that and I was that way. I was a young minister. I was that way. I had friends that were and had been brought up myself and had been baptized in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And that's why I was reared. That's what I heard in Sunday school. That's what I heard the preachers preach. That's what I heard my father tell me. And so that's what we believed. And then then I got ministering and I found others that they they said, "No, it was Jesus only." And I thought, "Well, you know, they got scriptures. This one's got scriptures. Someone says, "Well, now it's a it's not uh uh I I can see two in the Godhead. I can see the Father and the Son, but I can't see the person of the Spirit." And so, you had people from all different thoughts, but none of them could supernaturally say, "God, God is on the scene and he's going to prove what I say is the truth." Amen. &gt;&gt; But when I got into Brother Brandham's &gt;&gt; service and I began to hear those tapes and began to speak to him directly, the same scriptures took on entire new meaning. But here was the whole key, friends. He He's the only one I ever heard say, "If God does not come now and confirm what I say supernaturally, I am a false prophet." &gt;&gt; That's what every preacher needs to say. And I will say I cannot say that but I can say I am hearing a voice that was vindicated by God &gt;&gt; that God was pleased to confirm. &gt;&gt; And so now the even even the book of Revelation which is a book of symbols. Who's going to say what the symbols are? &gt;&gt; Who's going to say what those symbols are? You've got to have that vindicated voice. And that's why it's so important. Now, now we'll tie together with that the verse in Hebrews which I read last week and who gives a title to the service last week and this week the word of his power who being speaking of Jesus Christ who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power. not the power of his word, but the word of his power, whom he had when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. And so now when something is when the seals have been opened and the mysteries have been revealed, now we have the word, God has confirmed that's my word. Now friends, I'll just say it simply that is the word of his power. &gt;&gt; That then now you have the word that's the word of his power. &gt;&gt; You see Jesus was very clear with the people. He just told them you know if he didn't do the works of God don't believe me. But if I do the works, at least believe it for the work's sake. &gt;&gt; The works prove that the word was true. &gt;&gt; If you people were no different, if this message did not produce anything different than what Pentecost and other churches produce, I want to give you an a third announcement today. I would not be here. I would say that message is not producing what it claims to produce. But when I see a people that are held different, &gt;&gt; live different, &gt;&gt; families are different, the order of the home is different, the order of the church is different, and I see God doing the supernatural amongst it, then I know that came from somewhere. &gt;&gt; And the message is different. &gt;&gt; It's got to produce a different people. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word of his power. I said last week and I'll just repeat. God, he cannot increase or decrease in his power because he's absolute &gt;&gt; in that regard. However, he has put in place. He's put in place certain laws &gt;&gt; uh to to to regulate or to govern or to control the access to his power. And sometimes it's persons. When he has a messenger, he puts them in a certain place and he regards and he gives that messenger access. The believer, as a believer, you have access to this power. But not necessarily unlimited access. God has given you access to his power, access to his grace, given you access to forgiveness, has given you access to healing. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now he governs how his power may be accessed and who may have access to his power. But because, listen now, because God is ever present, filling all time and space, thus his power is always present. You do not have to pull God's power down from some distant place. His power, God is always present. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; That means all of his attributes are all always present. His attributes, all of them. His mercy is here available to you. Healing power is here available. Deliverance is here available. It's closer than your breath. &gt;&gt; It's God that fills all time and space. That's been such a revelation to me in the last in the last year or two. And it is the needs. This is a this world's a very needy place. &gt;&gt; You know, the most difficult thing is not to bring God down into your realm. That's not the problem. The problem is for you to believe that he's already there. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. &gt;&gt; That's the most difficult thing. That God is already there. All of his attributes are there. If God can diminish, then he's not God. &gt;&gt; If he has grace yesterday but not today, mercy yesterday but not today, he's not God. &gt;&gt; He's God. He's absolute. &gt;&gt; And that's something that's very important for us to remember. Now, we you as an individual uh I I would like that this service could be last Sunday and this Sunday could be something that you will take and resolve within your own heart with sincere prayer to God that you'll be able to take and act upon it and do it because it'll be a great benefit to you. You possess incredible power through the power of your tongue and your confession. Just in the last century and more recently in the last half of the century uh we discovered many things about the voice. I've heard brother Brandham's voice and I've heard other voices. I've heard them on paper tape. I heard them on a wire device, which is just a copper wire that went around on a reel and a voice came through. It was a wire recorder. And then it moved to the the poly tape, the real tore, and moved to the cassette tape, which we had with us. look like we'd have with us forever. And there's very interesting things. It's amazing that all of these things started emerging at the very time the seventh church age messenger came and and and his voice started being laid on some of those uh some of those almost uh very antiquated now &gt;&gt; but devices. &gt;&gt; It's really amazing because that scripture had to be fulfilled. But in the days of the voice, &gt;&gt; not in the days of the life, but in the days of the voice. &gt;&gt; And even when it came to uh the the the poly tape made from it's a byproduct of oil. It is so significant to me and it doesn't make up a whole lot of this message but I just found it as interesting that when that when uh when that tape passes the recording head uh I understand there's all particles and they lie in a linear type direction on on a tape on the recording side of the tape and when it passes the recording side the recording head. It mixes it all up. And they even said in the scientific document I was reading that it mixes it all up into symbols. They're all scattered into symbols. I recall I I I called the recording head the Apostle John and he recorded it and it all went scattered into symbols &gt;&gt; and nobody could figure it out. But then when it goes by the playing head, &gt;&gt; when you're going to hear the voice, all those symbols scatter back into the order that they're supposed to be. And I thought how perfect that is that that even God in the scientific world would have the very instrument that would lay down that prophet's voice and take those symbols literally the symbols out of the book of symbols of the book of revelation and take those those symbols and and bring that all those ideas that have been scattered and bring them all back into line and make it exactly thus say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's just a little bit by the sideline. But now we went on from that and we went to a disc which I understand is really read by light. The CD and the MP3 and the DVD and incidentally all of those are this whole thing the voice is actually called phone and now we're doing a lot on phone. It's that's the word in the Greek phone. And now the transmission of these words, the air and the whole surrounding uh space that God has created to hold these things is filled with all this massive amount of words. man soon discovered that there was a problem with this scientific advancement and that was to erase what had been said. And the President Nixon of the United States discovered that it was a a very very serious thing when tape and Watergate became a household word and as a result an impeachment process commenced and then he resigned. Uh I'm not here in politics. I think maybe he was a good man. uh brother Brandham said nice things about him but nevertheless that's what happened and things were laid down and that voice was heard and the plans and the schemes and all other things and and it was recorded and because of that guilt and condemnation came down and uh serious things happened that that's that's just one occur o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o occurrence just one occurrence and then we have the advent of the computerized technology and the people have uh hundreds of millions of computers in the land and discover that there's a hard disk and they can hit delete but it's not deleted. &gt;&gt; It's still there. &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of people today think they're sitting in churches such as you are and they believe they've actually hit the delete button for their sins, but it's still there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you have a prophet come and say, "There's only one way." &gt;&gt; There's only one way &gt;&gt; to delete and annihilate your sin. There's only one way. It's not being sorry. It's not feeling guilty. A lot of people feel guilt, but it is to confess &gt;&gt; with your mouth, &gt;&gt; I have sinned. &gt;&gt; I have done wrong, and I ask now for this forgiveness. And then the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ. And you must say the same thing that God has said. &gt;&gt; I've had people that wanted to be free of their drugs. They wanted to be free of their they wanted to be free of their alcohol. They wanted to be they wanted God to come on the scene and and and heal their home or or do some wonderful thing. And when I come to the place and say, number one, we're all sinners. We're born in sin and shape iniquity. I don't care what church you go to. We're all sinners. were all unbelievers by birth. &gt;&gt; They stop there. They don't want to agree with that. And then you can go no further. &gt;&gt; You can go no further. A lot of people, they want to, you know, they want the future to be all bright and they want God in their future, but they don't want to take care of the things in their lives in according to God's word. &gt;&gt; And this is what we have to agree with. If we don't come to agreement with the word and and confess it with our mouth and believe it in our heart, it won't happen. &gt;&gt; It just won't happen. It'll still be there. Now, in the message infallibility, I'm taking it slowly. And you that are visitors, you listen real close. You're going to have something to deal with before this service is over. It'll be in your hands. Then here stands a man, his name is William Brham, in the infallibility, the message infallibility of God's word. And he speaks about God. And he says, "You don't see him with your eyes." He's in another dimension. He said, "I can prove that to you. There's television coming through here. Pictures. Well, you young people listen close. There's pictures going through this room at this time. &gt;&gt; Do you see them? &gt;&gt; No. But they are here. Science can prove they're here. And strange that people will accept that. But then comes a supernatural vessel which I'm going to prove in the next few moments &gt;&gt; that God sent that God spoke through that God took control of his mouth &gt;&gt; not for him and not for the man but for you &gt;&gt; for me for this generation and will hold this generation responsible for it. &gt;&gt; True. He said, he said, "But there's voices coming and through here from radio." Do you see it? No. But it's here anyhow. Do you hear it? No. It's here anyhow. It's in another dimension. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Then so is Christ here." &gt;&gt; The things that I do shall you do also. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, I wish that this audience, this entire audience could be settled on that one thing right now. Now, what I wanted to do, and I didn't have sufficient time to do, I wanted to actually capture the voice of these next two, three quotes and have it played for you. My voice is a poor substitute. I would like to had you hear his voice saying these next things. Now I want you to note that if God is present indeed presented &gt;&gt; then that same God is present now &gt;&gt; exactly the same. Now in a message, do you believe? He invites the man who's coming in a prayer line. Would you come, sir? And I suppose we're strangers to each other. And you're conscious that you're standing in the presence of something besides your brother. And that is the Lord Jesus Christ in his resurrected power. The man now comes and he realizes there's another presence besides the man he's standing beside and I and he's telling him it is the resurrected Lord Jesus in his power. Sir, you are a very sick man. You've been attending doctors and they are examining you. And I hear one of them tell you that you have between 6 months and two years to live because you're dying with cancer. Now a man is standing here, a vessel that somehow captures a voice from another dimension that has already been spoken in the past. And now this man hears for the second time. He heard it from his doctors. Now he hears it from a prophet. You have between 6 months and two years to live. &gt;&gt; You are dying with cancer. And he said, "That is the truth." He said, "You believe me to be God's prophet or his servant. You believe it would if I would ask God along with this church that you would get well." He said, "I hear someone now." He's not he's not thinking this. This is not a mental exercise. He is hearing this voice. He hears the doctor speak. &gt;&gt; And if you think this is untrue, now you got to deal with this, my precious friend. He said, "Your name is Glenn." He said, "I hear somebody." said, "Your name is Glenn and your last name is Hill and you live at 2647 Melville Avenue." Something like that. Mel Melver. He even knew it. He didn't pronounce it exactly right. And so the man helped him and said, "Men are not Mel, but men are." And then Brother Brandon says, "Ch Avenue, Chicago." 2647 Melman Manar Avenue, Chicago. He said, "Is that true?" Now, I'm here telling you, friends, you don't realize it the way I'm bringing it to you, but your words go on God's recorder. You say, "I don't believe that." You got God on your hands. &gt;&gt; You got God to deal with. says, "Return to your home now shouting and praising God." &gt;&gt; Now he said, "Next one in a results of decision. Now we are strangers to each other, sister." A strange case, he's saying to her, "But there's none hard for our Lord Jesus." that handkerchief. She's holding a handkerchief. Says that handkerchief is for a woman, a girl. And that girl is your daughter. And that girl has a kidney trouble. And she's seriously ill. I see now he sees it. I see the doctors standing there. She was operated on and one of her kidneys was removed. And I hear the doctors say there's no hope for the other one. She's going to die. She hears &gt;&gt; from another realm. He's in another realm &gt;&gt; standing there and he hears now a vessel. God has brought a vessel on the earth that can capture the voice because he's got other things to say about the voice. He's not just going to say what doctors have said. He's going to now go be used of God to do away with the confusion that's in the church so that you will be able to say the right thing &gt;&gt; and repeat the right thing. Otherwise, how do you have any confidence? God is doing this friends to give you confidence. Yes. &gt;&gt; This isn't just some historical thing. God preserved this on God preserved this voice so you can hear it for yourself. &gt;&gt; Said, "You're going to die." He said to the lady, "And your heart's broke. The girl's a Catholic." And that's right. And then he tells her to take that handkerchief and he prays for her. Take that handkerchief to the girl. And one last one. These are just three. There's many. Now, he said that it might be settled in your mind forever. And I trust it will I know you're believers, but I trust it'll be projected so much further because I have something further I want to say. Of course. He said this man and I here with our hands up to God. This our first time meeting. He says, "But you are a Christian because your spirit catches the anointing of this spirit that's on me and it welcomes it. And so I know that you are a Christian and you're under a deep shadow. It's something wrong with the blood. And you've been to doctors and they are wanting to perform an operation and the operation is and he stops. I hear them two doctors consulting with each other and they want to take out an organ out of your body which is called the spleen. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is 1958. Where does a man with a seventh grade education ever come out of school and have that kind of wisdom? &gt;&gt; Where how does a man stand on the platform and say before the people, I hear two doctors, they're consulting with each other. Look what kind of risk he's running. The man to say, "That's not the case. I've never been I've never had two doctors say they want to take out my spleen." He could have had that thousands of times, but it never happened once in 33 years. What is God trying to say? He's trying to say, I'm going to hold this generation inexcusable [Applause] &gt;&gt; and let them know that their words are captured. &gt;&gt; I'm now going to give them thus sayaith the Lord so they can agree with a vindicated voice. Oh, I thank God we have a voice we can agree with. I'm thankful we have words we can say. &gt;&gt; Now, what about this church? This was spoken in Edmonton, Canada. He said, "And if this Christian church would only think that in their heart, the God of heaven deserves your best &gt;&gt; of everything that you have, the best of your time, the best of your devotion and everything that you are. We owe it to God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You young people can say that. Amen. I owe it to God. I owe my youth to God. I owe my strength to God. I owe my energy to God. I owe it to God. He says, "We give God maybe a few minutes on Sunday, sit and go to sleep while a Sunday school teacher's teaching and go home and think we've done our religion for the week." He said, "What a disgrace. &gt;&gt; I know I got He said, "I I got a name of being hard. I'm not hard, but what it is, I've got to stand in the judgment with each one of you." &gt;&gt; Listen to this next phrase. Now, tomorrow morning, he said this tape recorder would cry out something that I said, &gt;&gt; "And if there's a little tape recorder here &gt;&gt; to cry out the things that I say tonight, what will it be in the judgment bar &gt;&gt; when God's great tape recorder of my life turns on?" And your recorder, &gt;&gt; right? and your recorder &gt;&gt; and the world recorder and the great television screen that's on the sky and your life is before God and the entire world. He said, "I'd rather be here right now and be honest." &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy, but to be honest, listen friends, we're not here for a picnic. We're here to be right with God. &gt;&gt; And we're here and I am under I'm duty bound. I'm I'm responsible to the message that came and because it is recorded because it is held and because your Lord Jesus said every idol word. &gt;&gt; Every idol word &gt;&gt; will either be justified or will be condemned. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can be justified and not be condemned is you must know what God has said. What is thus sayaeth the Lord? And then you agree with that and you say that. How often do you say it &gt;&gt; over &gt;&gt; and over and over again until you believe it in your heart? &gt;&gt; Because the devil, your enemy, is always there to bring all kinds of guilt and condemnation and call you everything that that he's able to call you. But there is a perfect delete delete button. &gt;&gt; We've got a perfect delete button. &gt;&gt; I was sent this the other day. Brother Mark, thank you for sending this to me. He said, "Powerful word." Because I was exactly already had all this subject and I was I was going right to these quotes and when I read that I said that is so powerful I won't look. There are others, but I thought that is so powerful and I know you've experienced it and I want to thank you for it. And in the message, look, and this is my last quote for it now. He says, "And then if God can take that man and bridge away across by the blood of sheep and goats and could make the word of God creative by the mouth of a man, how much more &gt;&gt; uh not only but but the creative or the power of the sacrifice of a bull or goat, the blood of Jesus Christ that when sin is confessed and drops into that bleach of God's own creative way of taking away the stain. &gt;&gt; God made a way where our words are recorded and kept and God made a way for that repent of sinner to have those words annihilated. &gt;&gt; God made a way. &gt;&gt; And if God hadn't made a way, we're all lost. &gt;&gt; We're all hopeless. But God made a way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're without excuse. &gt;&gt; How thankful I am today to declare God has set a voice and God has taken away the confusion and God has given you an opportunity to say the same thing &gt;&gt; and agree with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. I don't know what's in your thoughts right now, and I don't know what you're going to confess when you get out of this place, but I would caution you as to what you say. Whatever you say will be remembered. And whatever you say, you will hear again. Just like that person came from the doctor's office maybe days or weeks ago says, "You have 6 months to two years to live. You're going to die." And a man stands here and tells him, "I hear the doctor speaking. They're telling you you've got sick." He now he's hearing it the second time. Once through a doctor and once through a prophet. &gt;&gt; And when that happens, you better be sure that prophet is tapped into something that man normally is not tapped into. And God didn't do that just for that man. God did that as an example that we would know that is the mouthpiece. &gt;&gt; That God is using &gt;&gt; what is worse his cancer or sin? &gt;&gt; What is worse that this they want to take out this spleen or that we are under the guilt and the condemnation and worse? What is worse that or deception? Religious deception. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The world is sinking in religious deception. &gt;&gt; You might say, &gt;&gt; "Well, who do you think you are?" I don't think I'm anybody. Quite frankly, I come trembling to this pulpit each time. I would not be here if I didn't have the confidence that God have sent me a voice that I could believe with, that I could agree on. And when I read these kind of things and know that it happened in our generation, I say thank God. I will agree with that. That was not a man. That is not psychology. That is the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Can the congregation say amen? You believe that? &gt;&gt; I'm not asking something unreasonable. I'm not making an unreasonable declaration. I'm simply saying man can't do that. And we can say amen. We have to say God alone can do that and we say amen. And if God did that then why did he do it? He didn't do it just for the person. He did it for the people. He did it for this generation that you might agree with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as soon as you profess that, according to Apostle Paul, when you profess and confess what God has spoken, the high priest will stand &gt;&gt; and move on your behalf. Until then, he does not move. He's seated at the right hand of the majesty on high. He does not move till you confess what God has said. Amen. &gt;&gt; How could it be more simple? &gt;&gt; God comes and demonstrates himself, shows himself, manifests himself, &gt;&gt; shows up. Man can't do that. Only God can do that so that you can believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then takes that voice. What book has more confusion? I tell you what, there's more confusion over this book called the Bible than there is over the Quran. There's more confusion over this than there is in Buddhism. &gt;&gt; There's more confusion. Why? Because this has truth. &gt;&gt; And that's what the enemy wants to focus on. Confuse the truth. &gt;&gt; Darken and make make vague the truth. &gt;&gt; Twist it and make it so close that people who are sincere, &gt;&gt; I'm sincere doesn't mean anything. Right? &gt;&gt; A lot of good people are sincere. &gt;&gt; That's not it. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, we just believe the simple, the basics. Jesus died and so on. Wonderful. I'm glad you do that. But if you believe the basics and don't accept what God has sent, the basics will do you no good. &gt;&gt; If God reveals it. Now, if this is only the basics, don't get me wrong. If that's all they ever heard and God never sent them and God never confronted them, then that's fine. They're they stand before God. Every person rises or stands stands or falls before God. Not before me, not before you. Not before anyone else. Before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The perfect delete. He says, "But how much more the blood of Jesus Christ and when sin is confessed and drops into the bleach of God's own creative way of taking away the stain." So far he said that puts it in the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more. When a man confesses his sin, sins and gets right with God and God drops the sin of his confession into the blood of his own blood and forgives that sin and replaces in that man. Listen now. And replaces God doesn't God's provided a a a catchment. He's provided a recorder for your voice. It is there. My voice is going out there. Now, I just want to say for a moment, thank you, Father, &gt;&gt; that you gave me a you gave me a place &gt;&gt; of confidence that I have a thus sayaith the Lord, that I can agree with and I can declare to the people. Otherwise, I tremble to be in this place and say something to you and declare it to be truth and for you to count on it and you to place your souls as it were in the hands of a man. Far be it from me to want that responsibility. God, you have to back it up. And God has backed it up. I've seen God come on the scene and deliver people while they sat in their seats. &gt;&gt; Just hearing the word of God, their lives changed and transformed. And so I have a sense of confidence today because I have a vindicated voice that God supernaturally vindicated. And when he says you're sinless, &gt;&gt; and someone says, "I don't believe that." You still have your sin. &gt;&gt; Your sin has been dropped into the sea of his forgetfulness &gt;&gt; because you confessed it. &gt;&gt; Because you said it. And he says, "And replaces in that man &gt;&gt; the original spirit &gt;&gt; that should have been there with his own spirit, making him a son of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I could stop right here. And replaces in him. &gt;&gt; It doesn't just that you confess. That's not just it. You can kneel here at the offer and confess and confess, but that's not the end of the operation. You confess your sin, it drops into the sea of God's forgetfulness. It is annihilated. He said it's like ink going into the bleach. And the ink, the chemistry of the ink, it it does it disappears. It's broken up. In fact, as the ink then becomes bleach. &gt;&gt; You talk about being rid of your sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's so gone. It can never come back again. But that's not the end. Then he takes his spirit, &gt;&gt; the one that you were supposed to have originally and and gives it into you and homogenizes it with his holy spirit and you become a son of God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; Oh grace &gt;&gt; of God, marvelous grace of God. Who wouldn't want to agree with that? &gt;&gt; Who wouldn't want to repeat that over again? I've confessed, oh God, according to your word. And now your messenger has said, you will take your spirit and replace take this and replace it with the spirit I was to have in the original &gt;&gt; and make me a son and daughter of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. that will give you the authority &gt;&gt; that will give you the insight insight as soon as another voice comes be it some uh some messenger of Satan or Satan himself come with some demon influence and say uh it's just in your imagination it's just in your emotions you can say you are a liar you are the father of lies I already have a voice that I can agree with and I'm making that profession and furthermore The high priest has already stood up. It's too late to you to give me that lie. He's already stood up. He's already moved on my behalf. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who we say things to and who we speak to and what is said is a incredibly important. Jesus said, "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't say, you know, go and tell someone else. &gt;&gt; Go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone. &gt;&gt; If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if you will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two that are that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. Now I'm I'm not going to enlarge. I just want to make this a point. It's important who you speak to. Amen. &gt;&gt; I would say wife or a husband, it's better not to tell another friend or something of some weakness or frailty within your family. Just tell the wife or tell the husband alone. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go into that because we're not speaking about families. But the Apostle Paul, he was being held a as a prisoner and they brought him in to a judgment chamber. And the high priest Ananas commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. And one of the soldiers whack him on the mouth and said to him, and the high priest commanded, they smack him on the mouth, smite him on the mouth. Then said Paul unto him. Paul wasn't done talking. Paul said, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall. For sitest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law. He knew the scriptures well. And they they that stood by said, "Revile thou God's high priest." Then said Paul, "I wish not, brethren, that he was the high priest, for it is written, thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people." It didn't nullify or invalidate what he had said, but he was it was contrary to the scripture that he should revile the high priest even though the high priest was a hypocrite. Even though the high priest was there to condemn him, &gt;&gt; he said, "The word does not allow me to speak against him." And so he he he he apologized in that way. I wish not that he was the high priest. See, it's what we say. It's not only what we say, but who we say it to. &gt;&gt; So if there's ought we say to the brother or the individual. If if there's a person in authority, a person that's been given position by God according to the word, then we have must be careful how we speak. And in this day, and I'm going to close in just a few minutes now, in this day, this Leoian age, one thing we feel very liberated about is to say what we want, to who we want, and to when we want. And then we may turn around say, but why haven't I got victory? Why am I not living where I should be living? Because you're not really doing what you should be doing. &gt;&gt; And I would say we should refrain from a bunch of idol words. Refrain from just a bunch of nonsense and refrain from negative talk, this negative thing. If you don't say, if you don't hear it in the word, then why say it? &gt;&gt; Now, I want to actually take another service. I want to take another service. The Lord willing. I'm so thankful that God's allowed my voice to hold up real well. But I want to take another service on the things that we should say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The things we should repeat, the things that God has made. And they are wonderful things. There are glorious things. I just have to hold my my whole self back. They're such glorious things. And that's why you need to hear the word. You need to hear the message. And when you hear it, say, "I'm going to say that." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to say that. &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat it over and over. &gt;&gt; I'm going to repeat it till I believe it. I'm going to repeat it till the devil is tired of hearing it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Does it work? Absolutely, it works. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; What's he talking about? Even in in such simple things as healing. &gt;&gt; I'm healed. &gt;&gt; I'm healed. &gt;&gt; I'm healed. The word said, "I'm healed. I'm going to continue to say I'm healed. I' I've done exactly." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, I'll just tell you this preacher tries to follow what he what he preaches. I try to follow it. Not always successful, but I try to follow it. When that disc in my neck when it herniated and instead of herniating out, herniated in against my spinal cord and put me in an emergency situation. And I went to the specialist, Dr. Richard Chan, one of three at the Royal Colombian Hospital. He has performed over 800 according to the uh College of Surgeons and Physicians. He has he has done over 800 operations on the spine. And I went to him and he's handed me a paper and he said, "Just sign this. I'll get your bed as quickly as possible." And I said, "Is there is there, you know, anything that could happen that might, you know, that this thing might change?" None. None. None at all. He says, "I have to go in here and I have to suck that disc out. What is remaining? And then I take some cow bone or bone from your hip and fuse those uh between the C6 and C7 together." And he said you I said uh but he said I I must tell you that the d you know the the the dangers that are here are you could hemorrhage if I happen to touch the spinal cord you could be quadripolgic and he named another one and named a fourth one and all of them were bad and I said well okay so I signed the document I couldn't drive my wife was driving I was in incre excruciating pain. They give me morphine. Morphine wasn't even touching it. And I said, "Call the church." &gt;&gt; Soon as we got in the car, call the church. Call Brother Tom if he's at the church, Brother Lance if he will come now, and Brother Tony. And they met me here, all three of them. And I walked down this aisle and walked and stood right here. And I said, "Whenever I have a serious case, brothers," we all stood here, four of us. So whenever I have a serious case, I tell them, number one, do exactly what the word of God says because that's all God will honor. And number two, I tell them, read, be certain of God, the message. Be certain of God. And since this happened, I've I've carried that book with me because brother Brandham says in that book, "How many times I've gone back over my life and turned over every stone and still he remains silent." Says, "Then you have to be certain of God." And I said, "The scripture says, is any afflicted? Let him pray. Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church and their prayer of faith will save the sick and if he's committed any sins they shall be forgiven him. I said I'm not sick. I'm terribly afflicted. I've not asked you to come and pray for me. I've asked you to come and pray with me because I according to the word have come here to pray. &gt;&gt; And we knelt here and we prayed. I said that to say this to you. I believe it's absolutely absolutely impossible to have an answer from God outside of doing what God has said to do. And that's why I think it's so important to agree with the word. Just agree with it and confess it and keep saying it. Keep speaking it. I am healed. I'm healed. And I stood up before the church and gave a testimony that I I believe that God had spoken to me. And this is what he said. It was seven weeks and the loss of quite a few pounds from the pain, but nevertheless, God came on the scene. &gt;&gt; And I said, God said to me, be thou whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I said, that does to me does not say improved &gt;&gt; and that does not say better. It says, "Be whole." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That word works, friends. &gt;&gt; But I'm I'm still I still don't I'm not here declaring this message because I have that healing. I'm here declaring this message is because this word, the seals have been opened and the word has been made clear. And you and I don't have any excuse. So thankful that the voice, we've heard a voice and God has recorded the voice. and so thankful that we've been able to put it around the globe. I thank God for the church. I thank God for those that have worked and labored so hard that amongst all the other things, all the Hollywood stars and all their stuff and all the perversion that goes on encircling the globe, &gt;&gt; but amongst all of that confusion &gt;&gt; and uncleanness &gt;&gt; is a clear sounding voice that says, "Thus sayaith the Lord, &gt;&gt; not thus sayeth the Bible school." as good as it might be. Or thus sayith what my teacher has told me. But now from another dimension, &gt;&gt; through the ordained mouthpiece comes a voice that you can count on. &gt;&gt; And that God has made this God, you hear me? God has made this generation accountable for the last messenger's voice. And I say, God bless you. I thank God he's given me ear to hear. &gt;&gt; Blessed Jesus said are your eyes for they see what they see. And blessed are your ears for they hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; Blessed are we. &gt;&gt; How wonderful. Tonight our brother Taye from Ghana is going to be speaking things on his heart. And I'm anxious to be here. 5:00 we're starting sharp. Of course. And you'll be here. You'll be ready, won't you? &gt;&gt; And from this day forward, may you take and may God put a seal upon our mouths, upon our words that we will agree with the things, the things we need to speak about in normal life, it just passes away. It doesn't mean anything. We have to talk about living and about all of these things. Let those things be gone. But the things that pertain to eternal life. Amen. To eternal life. I want to I want to be in perfect harmony with it and desire that each one of us each one under the sound of my voice today will be in harmony with it. Are you here? Are you here? And perhaps you're under some cloud of condemnation. It's a lie. And you do not have to be under it anymore. &gt;&gt; You say, "What should I be agreeing with? There is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit." Say it today. Say it again. Say it. Say it when you wake up. Say it in the middle of the day. Keep repeating it. The devil will get tired of hearing you. &gt;&gt; Say, "Is that mind over matter?" No. That is that is the word over to the devil. That's what it is. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with it? &gt;&gt; You can see I can hardly wait to come back with the things we want to say. Amen. Let's stand to our feet. I want to sing 2179. Faith of our fathers. What's the next line? Oh, say it again. &gt;&gt; I like that part. Don't you? Faith of our fathers living still. It didn't go anywhere. Why? Because God of our fathers is here. Hallelujah. Nice to have brother and sister Andes here. It's nice that they have their uh as much of their families as they have here and the grandchildren which they could watch singing. No wonder they were smiling when uh Sunday school children were singing. And if you thought they were smiling and you saw me smiling, did you see me smiling? I was smiling, too. This is this is a first for me. There's always first, but this was the first for me. I had a daughter playing, had grandson up looking after some of the uh computers up there. and a great granddaughter are down here singing. So I thought, my goodness, if time goes on and we stay around, where's this going to go? Granddaughter and daughter and a great granddaughter. My goodness. I thought that's where I got the phrase, I'm so glad they're here. Amen. Glad you're here. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There'll be a great gathering there. Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. God bless you. All right, let's sing this together. &gt;&gt; Faith on our father still [Music] fire and sword. Oh our hearts be high with joy. There we go. Holy face. We will be true to the children. Our father changing praise and son. Earth and consious free [Music] would be their children [Music] like them for the holy gra we will be to the end of our we [Music] as go by mighty word [Music] [Music] We will be true to the voice of our father. He will be true to me. &gt;&gt; I'd like everybody, everybody 25 and under, our young people who are singing 25 and under, you know, you have something that to me is a one of the greatest privileges. And I want to speak right down to you young people. Don't change your course. Don't allow anything to change your course. God has set you amongst a group of people, not just a church. If this is just a church, I'd say, well, you know, do the best you can. But I am saying to you as a personal witness, God has brought you under the sound of a voice that God himself almighty come from another realm, another dimension that he had actually created to hold a voice. And he and he and he brought that same voice right back to a a a a vessel, a prophet messenger, and said, "Here, here it is." He could hear it. Here's what I here's what was said. Here's what I have recorded on my recorder. Say it again to this person. Help them out. Then he saw a little fellow 27 years old, a little preacher with a thousand questions. so so confused and troubled. I said, "Brother Brandham, how is it that people can prophesy, speak in tongues, interpret, and their life does no way match the word of God?" And four years before he spoke the message, he asked me, "Have you heard my tape on false anointed ones at the end time?" That was May 1961. He did not speak it until 1965. I rejoiced immensely. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I told brother I told brother Brad no I haven't heard it. He went through four scriptures and in four scriptures just quoted four scriptures never enlarged on them. And I can say to you a thousand questions and confusion dissolved and crumbled. And I even thought, why didn't I think of that? Why didn't I I realize now that that voice, God's word in that mouth was different. &gt;&gt; You remember brother Anatoli from Usuzbekistan said he heard the tape, false anointed ones at the end time. That's how he came in. And that's how about 250 people in his congregation, he only had one message. I asked this brother or brother Tay, "How did you come to the message?" He said, "The first book that came into my hands was false anointed ones." &gt;&gt; That was it, Brother Tay. Hallelujah. So we can both rejoice. And we do. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; You young people, never change your course. Whatever you do, I may be gone, but never change your course. Go in that straight direction. Everybody 25 and under. Faith. Faith. [Music] We will be &gt;&gt; 25. Once more, more [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; our sisters. [Music] Yes, &gt;&gt; we will be true to &gt;&gt; all of you brothers. Heat. Heat. Heat. We will be true to &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Ken Amdies, I'm going to ask you if you will come please and dismiss this congregation and the invisible congregation on the internet around the world. Ask God's blessing upon them if you would please. [Music] Let's bow our heads. [Music] Heavenly Father, so good to use that phrase knowing that we've come from you and that we are your children. We believe, Lord, that we have heard your word reiterated and ministered to us this morning that was delivered unto your faithful prophet, Brother Brandham. And Lord Jesus, the faith that we have is the living word of God, Jesus Christ yourself, risen from the dead and is alive with us this morning. We believe Lord that faith of our fathers, the apostolic fathers that preached this same message that we heard this morning that was delivered under the apostle Paul and Lord has been open to us the seven seals. Lord Jesus, God make it live within us. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, &gt;&gt; we believe that we've been honored this morning to meet with you, the resurrected Jesus Christ. move in our midst, move in our lives, Lord. May we always be yielded unto you in every way that you could have your pleasure to walk and to move within us. And as we would hear these young people singing the church of tomorrow if time would go on as we did not think we would be here this many years. But Lord Jesus you're faithful in all things to bring forth your glory in a perfect bride that's been made perfect and to become the living word. Lord Jesus go with each individual this morning. Fulfill your purpose in their life. Bless every home, Lord Jesus, that's represented here until we can gather back again tonight and hear your servant, Brother Tay. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask your blessing upon the ministry here, Pastor Bisco, and everything that's done and said, may it be to your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. God bless you. We dismiss you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Go and encourage one another. Shake one another's hand. And God go with you. Lord willing, we see you this evening. You're dismissed. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
