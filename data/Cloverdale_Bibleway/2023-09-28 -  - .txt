gathering my name I'll be in the Mr scripture says how many believe that to be true tonight that means that the Lord Jesus Christ himself is present tonight and where Jesus is there is life where Jesus is there's miracles where Jesus is this Deliverance where Jesus is there is healing where Jesus is there's forgiveness of sins where Jesus is all things are possible how many have you need tonight how many believe that the Lord has a word for you tonight as brother Darren prayed I so appreciate I say Lord on Sunday I receive a word from you and tonight I believe it is a word for me that's our attitude when we come to the house of God lord speak to my heart and I want to sit in the back there I come to church with a desire with a need and I keep it before the Lord throughout the service and I say Lord your word is a discern our thoughts an interest of my hearts let your word address the needs that I have in my heart and I will not be satisfied if the service goes until the end and you've not spoken to me regarding my needs that should be your attitude tonight and say Lord I'm gonna hold this before you tonight make sure you you touch this night address this area of my life speak to me about this I have this request Lord I have this question Lord how many will do it tonight before we go into the word and before I read our Bibles there's a quote that I'd like to share with you if the brothers can put that up for me for the past four weeks I've not been able to escape this quote it just keeps coming back over and over again and this may be know what that's like where the Lord seem to be you know zeroing you know the particular scriptural quotes I'd like to read that to you before we get into the word problem says this and when I was coming over I was thinking of the infallibility of God's spoken word it's just perfect and if we could only eat this audience you in this audience tonight if Clover the Bible away tonight could only get settled in their mind who said this what this really is this spoken word would not need any healing service we will not need any salvation article it will be finished if you just realize what the word was and I says now let's look at it so to now we're going to look at this we're going to look at what this word is who said this word and what this word is this spoken word and it by the preaching of the word it can be settled in your mind what the word is and who spoke these words we cannot leave the service tonight without an altar call without a healing service but everybody will go back home healed anybody who's bound will go back from delivered anybody who was the new will find the answer to the need if we can only settle in your mind what this word is [Music] I don't speak presumptuously when I said I believe I received the word of the Lord for tonight and this is what God wants me to speak on tonight and if I can only get you to see this word if it can only help your faith tonight to see why the prophet of God is saying here this will be a special night for you how many believe that let's take our Bibles let's open in the book of second Corinthians chapter one thank you musician [Music] [Music] second Corinthians chapter one beginning in verse verse 18. But as God is true our word toward you was not yea and a for the Son of God Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us even by me and Sylvanas and timothius was not yea and nay but in him was yea for all the promises of God in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of God by us let's also turn in the Book of Revelation chapter 3. very familiar scripture verse 14. Revelation 3 14. and unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans right these things saved the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God Amen you may be seated prayer is we approach the word Heavenly Father we exalted tonight Lord and you have exalted Thy word Above All Things Lord we've come to be fed we've come to speak your word we've come to believe your word and to receive your word I pray that the Holy Spirit Will anoint your word to our hearts and may the things that we read come to pass in Jesus name amen I like to take for a title tonight I won't be long amen so be it that's my title tonight amen so be it now brother says in the scripture the revenue Revelation chapter 3 is Jesus addressing himself to the senior churches and if you read from chapter 2 to chapter 3 the message to the seven Church ages to every Church age when Jesus speaks to Germany says write these things and he addresses himself or he introduces himself or a characteristics of himself to that church age to the Ephesian church he says he that hold at the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks so that's how he introduced himself to that church to Smyrna it says the first and the last which was dead and which is alive the program message says he which have the sharp sword with the edges tatara it says this thing says the Son of God who have his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass to start this he says he that had the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars to Philadelphia he introduce himself he says this thing say of he that is Holy he that is true he that have the Key of David he that openeth and Norman Sharif and Sharif and no man openeth now we come to deliver the senior Church Asian verse 14. what he introduced himself to John and says write these things these things safe the amen now he introduce himself differently than he did in the previous Church ages his introduction says I am the amen I am the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God says this like this my isn't that the most wonderful description of the attributes of our lovely Lord and Savior Jesus Christ these words just make me want to shout he says they bring such a spiritual reality into my heart just reading them without even waiting for a third revelation of the spirit upon them it fills me Jesus is giving us a description of himself in relation to the last age now that's an important statement this description throughout the seven churches each description was in relation to that specific Church age the description that Jesus chose for this church age he says I am the amen and brother continues and says the days of grace are winding up he has looked from the first century right through to the 20th and told us all things concerning these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last age to us he gives us one final look at his own gracious and supreme deity this is the Capstone revelation of himself and we know the Capstone comes in the end time the camisole is a final element to to to uh that comes upon the the search of a perfect man so what he's saying here is that the Capstone Revelation is a revelation of the amen It's the final Revelation and God introduced himself to the senior churches as being the one who is the amen let's carry on thus save the Amen brother says Jesus is the amen of God Amen my I love that Jesus is the amen of God Jesus is the solidic being of God amen stands for finality it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise it stands for the Seal of God the Capstone revelation of Jesus Christ in the lyrics in the church ages I am the amen I am the word I am the so being of God in other words I am the one who makes these things to come to pass Jesus is that word which is the amen of God when God speaks something why he speaks is Jesus as we sing I speak Jesus what is the message Jesus what is the message the amen it's the cups of revelation of Jesus Christ in his last days God is letting us know to this level see in church I am the amen I am the Soviet and whatever I say is final and I stand for prevailing promise so all my promises are yea and amen everything that I've declared from the first church age in the last church is final I will not alter the words that came out of my mouth the scripture says my Covenant will you will I keep there is nothing in the word of God that God is going to alter there's some circumstances in laodicea there's nothing in his word is going to take away or change or altar because of the realities of this age he swore by himself because he is the amen of God and he's come to John to let you know tell us people in laodicea especially the message of that age I am the amen and I've come to fulfill my word pertaining to this age and whatever I say is final like it continues and this is from the church age book in The Living Church he continues and connects the scripture Revelation 3 14 to Isaiah 65. that says that he will bless himself in the Earth shall bless himself in the god of Truth and he does swerve in the earth Shall Serve by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they're a hit from mine eyes now he says the word truth here in look in the Bible the word truth there is amen in the Hebrews are men and brother says he is the god of the amen he never changes what he does never changes he says it and it stands fast he does it and it's done forever none can take from what he says or add to it what he says is final final means there's no alteration to it you cannot add to it and you cannot remove from it and it says so let it be amen so let it be aren't you glad that you served that kind of a god aren't you glad to know that you serve the god of the amen aren't you God that you serve Jesus Christ the amen of God because you can rest your faith upon his every word because it's final he says you can know exactly where you are with him at any time God doesn't play games he is the amen and God won't change this thing said the amen he says I like that it means that whatever he said is final it means that whatever he said to the first age and to the second age and to all the ages about his own true church and about the false fun is exactly right and you won't change it also means that while he started out with in Genesis he will finish in Revelation he asked for he has to for he is amen so let it be everything that God has promised in Genesis he fulfills in Revelation in other words every word of God is that's been spoken in Seal form he'll bring it to pass right because Revelation is the manifestation so what God has sown in Genesis what he is spoken his seed from he's letting us know in this age I'll bring it to pass now the Bible in Revelation chapter 22. ends the very last verse of the Bible and the very last word of the Bible as a matter of fact is amen if you read revelation 22 verse 20 he which testify these things saved surely I come quickly a man even so come Lord Jesus verse 21 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen and that's how the Bible ends God punctuates his word the last verse the last word of the Bible the last book the last chapter the last line the last word amen God wants you to know sorry let it be everything that he said it will be Let It Be amen so be it everything that was spoken in this word so be it from Genesis 1 1 to Revelation 20 to 21 so be it from later big you know beginning God created from that very first verse to the last verse of the Bible even so come let the bless our Lord Jesus Christ be with you the Bible ends with amen and God punctuates his word by saying Amen to it now the word amen appears in many places in the scripture and let's go through through some of them here I'm not going to I'm not going to go through all them for the sake of time first chronicles 16 36 blessed be the Lord blessed be the Lord God of Israel forever and ever and all the people said amen and praise the Lord so this word appears in many forms in the Bible in Isaiah 65 as read it appears as the word truth the god of Truth which is the god of Amen it also appears when Jesus says verily verily that means truly truly and it also means amen amen so whenever Jesus in the scripture was saying verily verily what he's saying amen amen he's saying that the words that I'm speaking now will come to pass the words that I'm speaking are true for I am the amen of God amen amen verily verily I say unto you Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 6 and Ezra bless the Lord the great God and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and about their heads and Worship the Lord with their faces to the ground Psalms 41 13. blessed be the Lord God of Israel from Everlasting and to Everlasting amen and amen Psalm 72 verse 19 and blessed be his glorious name forever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory amen and amen Psalms 89 52 blessed be the Lord forevermore amen and amen John 21 25 and there are also many other things which Jesus did though which if they should be written everyone I suppose that even the whole the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen Romans 11 36 for of him and through him and to him are all things to him being Glory forever amen Romans 15 33 now the god of peace be with you all amen first John 5 21 Little Children keep yourselves from Idols amen Revelation 1 7 behold he cometh with cloud and every hour shall see him and they also reach Pierce him and all kingdoms of the Earth shall wail because of him even so amen Revelation 1 18 I am he that liveth I was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen now the prophet says and I believe one we believe God every time God says anything we punctuated with amen that's right whatever God said he said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to them forever somebody will say well in a way amen if he said repent and be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost amen see if he said to Joshua live by faith amen and he said I will come again amen and he said you're the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and he said bye by straps you were healed amen I'm the god I giveth you peace amen receive you the Holy Ghost amen everything that the Holy Ghost speaks the Holy Ghost in us will punctuate it with an amen because it's the Holy Ghost agreeing with his own word it's not about saying amen because you want to say Amen it's a right thing to say in the service it's when the Holy Ghost punctuates that word in your soul bearing weaknesses of what he's saying is true to you that's when God speaks to you personally right it's not about the motion going through the motions of saying Amen in the service but it's about the Holy Spirit punctuating his own work as they come across a Pulpit and as always being ministered every service and as it is ministered tonight there will be a statement that is said there'll be a scripture read there will be a quote read and something in you will say Amen and that is the holy ghost personalizing that word to you bearing weakness of that word personally to you amen he says let's go back to Calvary and get the real stock of the Holy Ghost in us then you know where you stand you know who your father is and every time then the Bible says anything you punctuate it with amen the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to them forever the old donkey might say I don't know about that but the real genuine pedigree says amen you get the Bachelor of the Holy Ghost and you believe in God's power you believe every word God says and you punctuate it with that to everything God says another quote and a good Thoroughbred Christian knows where the storehouse of God is they know that they are born of God the word is made flesh in them and every word that God says they don't differ with it they say it's right amen and amen they punctuated with an amen every time amen amen amen something in them punctuates it himself something in them something in you punctuates the word and what is that something he says himself the word himself punctuates the word in you the word in you agrees with the word that's coming across the pulpit it's the Holy Spirit bearing witness to his own word and testifying on the amen of God and I'm saying Amen to what is being ministered I'm acknowledging that to be true and I will bring that to pass that's what happens when your soul cries amen if you're saying no whatever you're speaking I agree with your word and the Holy Ghost he means bang witness that you will bring it to come to pass in my life amen you don't say anything to every statement do you without we say Amen to why God makes real to us in the service because that is the word is about to bring to pass in your life so listen carefully to the web being Minister tonight when suffering you Wells up and says amen it's the Holy Ghost bang weakness that he will bring it to pass in your life amen Jesus is the amen of God now the first occurrence of this word amen in the Hebrews Amen in the Greek which we read in the New Testament in the Greek it's Amen which was said at the end of a statement of a prayer as read in the New Testament blessed be the Lord Our God Amen may peace and peace and Grace be unto you amen so amen was said at the end of his statement and a lot of this statement it says making it personal and making this petition or prayer thereon so the person who's ministering or saying a prayer when you say Amen to it in a great year it means that you're you're making that plea or that petition you're on as though you were the one saying it say I'm making this my own by agreeing with it I'm saying Amen to it let those words which we speak become my own now in Numbers chapter five let's turn to the scripture this is the first occurrence of this word in the Bible now brother Murphy I believe last year spoke on this chapter and I strongly recommend that you go back and listen to that service I didn't listen to it because I was going to be preaching on the same chapter and I didn't want to go in a different direction but I remember it vividly it was the spirit of jealousy brother Murphy you remember that go back and listen to that service it will do you good we're going different way tonight but this is the first time in the Bible where we see this word Numbers Chapter 5 we can begin verse 11. and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them if any man's wife go aside and commit a trespass against him and a man alive with her carnally and he'd be hid from the eyes of the husband and be kept close and should be defiled and there'll be no witness against her neither she be taken with the manner and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he'll be jealous of his wife and should be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and she'd be jealous of his wife but should be not defiled then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and he shall bring her offering for her the tenth part of anitha of Barley Mill he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon for it is enough ring of jealousy an offering of Memorial bringing iniquity to remembrance and the priest shall bring her near and set her before the Lord now pay attention to something from verse 17. and the priest shall take holy water in the Earthen vessel and of the dust that is in the floor of the Tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water and the preacher said the woman before the Lord and uncovered the woman's head and put the offering of Memorial in her hands which is a jealousy offering and the priest shall shave shall have in his hand the beetle water that causes that cause of the curse and the priest shall charge her by an oath and say unto the woman if no man have laid with thee and if that was gone that thou has not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband be thou free from this Beetle water that causes the curse but if thou has gone aside to another instead of thy husband and if that be defiled and some men have leaned with thee beside their husband then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing and the priest shall say unto the woman the Lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when the Lord's death made thy side to rot and I barely to swell in other words it was going to Shadow a woman and this water that causes the curse shall go into the bowels to make that Bailey to surround the thigh to rot and the woman shall say amen amen and then the priest shall write these curses in the book now this is interesting and the priest shall write these curses in the book and then he shall brought them out with the bit of water and then he shall cause a woman to drink the beetle water that causes the curse and the water that cause of the Kershaw entering into her and become bitter and when the priest shall take the jealousy offering of the woman's hand and shall weigh the offering before the Lord and offer it upon the Altar and the priest shall take a handful of the offering even the memorial thereof and burn it upon the Altar and afterwards shall cause a woman to drink the water and one he had made her to drink the water then it shall come to pass that if she be defiled and have down trespass against her husband the water shall cause the curse shall enter into her and become bitter and rebellious as well and her thighs shall route and the woman shall be accursed among the people and if the woman be not defiled but be clean then it shall be free and shall conceive seed it's a lengthy reading but this is the first mention of this word amen and amen in the double occurrence here amen and amen if a woman was guilty of adultery or the husband suspected that she was guilty of adultery and this is the offering of the the spirit of jealousy here and if the spirit of jealousy Came Upon him he will bring the woman to to the priest and God give Moses the ordinance on how to deal with these issues now two things will happen here if she was guilty the curse that the priest has spoken will materialize in our life if she was innocent she would go away free and be Vindicated that she was innocent of the sin but how does this come to play here is that the priest will take dust off the floor of the Tabernacle mix it with some with holy water some water and then make her drink the water but before he makes her drink the water he will write these words in the book and then when you rest the words in the book he now blocks the word so he takes the water and he wipes the ink off of the book another ink and the water is mix and it makes her drink it in other words he makes her drink The Words which he has written in the book and once he drinks those words God says she has to say Amen and amen and then if you look at the scripture there's nothing in this ordinance that can actually close a woman's womb if you drink water and dust that's not going to close your womb right but there's something else that takes place after this ordinance is met because God is the one who spoke these words he causes this word to produce in that woman why he said he was going to produce water and dust on its own doesn't produce anything but because God is the one who sparked those words one the woman receives this or performs the acts of God ordain and she says amen amen amen so be it each was guilty the friends of the prince has spoken will happen to her but if she wasn't guilty nothing will happen to her right so that's that's in a negative that's about a curse but let's turn this around in the positive the woman is standing before a priest before a preacher before a minister she's standing in the church in the Tabernacle and he is not pronouncing the words of God upon her and she is required to say amen amen and she must eat the word that was written in the book and once she eats the word that was eaten the book is that the word that she eats that's going to bring a change in her body it's the word that she's eating from that curse that's going to cause your belly to swell that's going to cause the thigh to rot what's going to bring about a change in our body it's the words that the priest has spoken and the words that he spought are written in the book and when he gets her to eat the words that are in the book those words perform a change in your life but for that change to come about in your life she says amen amen so Shima is the words of the scroll or the words that are in the book and now in the new test this is the Old Testament in the New Testament we found a very similar instance now in the positive there is another woman but she's a virgin she stands before Gabriel a messenger and he's going to speak words unto her and she's going to say being unto me according to your word in other words he's going to say amen amen and once she says amen so be it in other words when she says when she says amen amen what she's actually saying let the things that you have declared happened to me this is what that woman in Numbers Chapter 5 was required to say if I'm guilty of the words if I'm guilty of what my husband is accusing me of then let the things that you've spoken let them happen let my belly swell let my thyroid let those things happen to me amen so be it let the words on the priest materialize in my life let those things to spoken happen let those things that you've declared take place in my life if I'm guilty then let my tie rot but if I'm innocent then none of these things happen then I may be justified so be it I'm not running away from it I'm not escaping it I'm not fighting it so be it that's the attitude that God required in Numbers chapter five and that's the attitude of Mary so be it let the things which you're speaking let the words that are coming out of your mouth let there be a power that's going to make them happen so be it I'm not fighting it behold I'm the Lord's helmet be enough to not connect to your word if this world is of God let the words of Gabriel happen to me I'm not going to fight it I'm not going to escape it I'm not I'm I'm I want this word to capture me I want to be captured by the power of your words level things that you have spoken run after me let those things you've spoken cause me to become subject do the things that you've spoken that's the attitude of the belating heart amen so be it I'm not finding your word I'm not trying to run away from it I'm not trying to reason with it I'm not trying to debate it so be it if you're saying that you're my healer so be it let those words that you're declaring happen to me I'm not escaping and I'm saying Amen to it so be it I don't understand it I have no idea how it's going to come to pass but here I am before the priest let your words come to pass [Applause] [Music] I ain't finding you Lord I'm not rizzling against your word so be it if I'm guilty that those words come to pass let the power of your word bring a change in my life now Mary didn't know how these things were going to come to pass but now we're given the clue in the scripture the New Testament it says how will this thing be the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you now we understand that the words that were spoken by a messenger Gabriel couldn't have been materialized without the Dynamics without the holy ghost coming and making those words come to pass so now this gives us a good idea of Numbers Chapter 5. because like I said earlier on drinking water with dust doesn't cause your belly to swell or your thigh or your womb to shut it doesn't do it so what that informs us is that when the prince spoke those words because those words were not the thought of a man and they're the thought of God the Holy Ghost there was a power that followed those words that caused those words to produce the result of the word it wasn't the water of the Dust it wasn't the ink of the curse word in the book it wasn't those things that caused ability to swell or a threat to rock it was that God punctuated his word with an amen it was the Holy Ghost took the word that was spoken by a priest and made them to become material into a into a into a physical reflection of why God spoke so there was a tangible result in her body there was a body change brought about the words that was spoken of God what happened to Mary there was a body change she was a virgin and she became pregnant the words of Gabriel which are the words of Isaiah which are the thoughts of God were spoken to her and her attitude was so be it and the Holy Ghost went after that word and brought a change in her body do you believe in the body change how are you going to get a body chance is what a messenger in your day speak the thoughts of God the words of God before the foundation of the world what those things that God thought about you when the messenger begins to Proclaim his message not want to study this ministry but when it begins to Proclaim his message he begins to declare the thoughts of God concerning you and if your attitude is so big the Holy Ghost goes after that word and brings a change in your body what's going to change your body one of these days it's this message that you're feeding on if you eat the words of the book the priest has written it in the book and it's magic to eat the words John go to the angel and take the book eat the book John and if you eat the book the words that are written in the book will grow in your belly will go in your body regarding yourself and the Holy Ghost will bring your body change because you said so be it amen so be it it's not up to you it's up to the one who spoke it your attitude is not to try to make it happen your attitude is to be as vulnerable as one can be and say Here I Am do what you want that's man's attitude I am the husband of the Lord be it unto me I'm not going to try to influence this I'm not going to try to make it happen I'm not going to try to do anything about it I'm as vulnerable as I can be before your words let them happen to me let your word I'm preeminence over me let your word Supreme Over Me when my body comes to subjection to the words that you're speaking so be it if somebody tonight can only realize what this word is and who's these words and the attitude of your soul is so big they want to be a simple one among us tonight anybody who's sick can get healed tonight because all you can tell the Lord is so big so be it Lord stop it Lord if your words are true and you've said that You're My Healer let those words with response let them happen to me [Applause] Let My Life Begin to testify that those words are true so big you said you're my deliverer and I've been bound by chains for years and years and years but if your word is true so big let your work come into my life and break the chains as your words say be it unto me amen so be it let your words become flesh now in Jeremiah 28 let's turn to that quickly about 20 minutes I am not even following you my nose here there's something that that spoke to me when I was great for this don't worry about your notes this is not about mechanics this is about the power of God Jeremiah 28 and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah the king of Judah in the fourth year as verse one and in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azure the prophet which was of gibeon spake unto me in the house of the Lord again we're back in the Tabernacle in the house of the Lord in the presence of the ministers the priests and of all the people the congregation saying thus speak of the Lord of hosts the god of Israel saying I have broken the Yoke of the king of Babylon within two full years will I break again into this place all the vessels of the Lord's House that Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon took away from this place and carried them to Babylon and I will bring again to this place king of Judah with all the captions of Judah that went into Babylon save the Lord for I will break the Yoke of the king of Babylon and when the Prophet Jeremiah then the Prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet in the presence of the priest and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of God even the Prophet Jeremiah said amen the Lord do so the Lord performed thy Words which thou has prophesied and bring Again The Vessel of the Lord's house and all that is carried away captive from Babylon into this place nevertheless here thou now this word that I speak in thy ears and in the ears of the people the prophets that had been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against Great kingdoms and of war and of evil and of pestilence he's saying all the prophets that came before you and Before Me Prophet on judgment but the prophet which is going to prophesy peace which you are prophesying your peace now when the word of the Prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the Lord truly sent him even so would I break the Yoke of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within the space of two full years and the Prophet Jeremiah won his way German I didn't fast German I didn't argue ananiah comes and prophesy it's something contrary to what the prophet says Jeremiah said amen so be it let the Lord perform the words that you've spoken because if what you're saying is a word of God then you come to pass my attitude as a Believer is amen so be it you said God is speaking so be it let us see God perform the words that you've spoken and Jeremiah went his way no fasting no arguing now then the word of the Lord came out to Jeremiah after ananiah the prophet had broken the Yoke from off the neck of the Prophet Jeremiah saying go tell him saying that serve the Lord that was broken yolks of wood but that shall make for them yolks of iron for thus if the Lord of hosts the god of Israel I put a yoke on iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and they shall serve him and and I have given him the Beast of the field also then say the Prophet Jeremiah and hanania to the prophet here now ananya the Lord have not sent me but thou making these people to trust in their life therefore that saved the Lord behold I will cast it from off the face of the Earth this year that shall die because thou will start Rebellion against the Lord verse 17. so hananaya the prophet died the same year why the scripture ending that way to let you know that what Jeremiah said was of God what hananaya said wasn't of God Jeremiah didn't fight it he did not argue it he said so be it let the Lord perform what you said because Jeremiah is a prophet knows that the one characteristics of God is that everything he says come to pass so if a prophet use an anointing of God and he's speaking on behalf of God so be it let it happen Amen Let the Lord perform what you said but when God came and spoke to Jeremiah and said Dustin law you shall die the scripture ends ananiah died so who did God speak to the amen of God has a final say now this is very important because in numbers I think in Deuteronomy rather chapter 18 I believe verse 21-22 God tells the children of Israel this is how you shall know whether I've signed a prophet or not eat the things that he speaks come to pass I'm with him but if what he said doesn't come to pass the description don't be alarmed don't worry about it Jeremiah knows that he wasn't worried about it he wasn't alone by it if you're a Son of God the words that you speak will come to pass now Jeremiah's attitude was not to argue or dispute the prophecy but he said amen amen So eventually none of the things that hananaya prophesied came to pass but what Jeremiah said happened now as horrible as it is to speak Allah in the name of God which is what ananya did he said Lord and he was alive and he calls the people to believe in a lie as horrible that is it is equally horrible to take God's truth for a life it's one thing to speak a line in the name of God and it's another thing to take the truth or the word of God for a lie in other words doubting what God has said you're making God a liar right but I'm gonna go on and say this then the Israelites one settle there and what if they get to studying while I'm not worthy is talking about when they're in Goshen and to apply the blood you don't have to do nothing the only thing is to come under the shed blood that settles it once on the blood you're safe what if the deaf angel with his sword in his hand sweeping the land you didn't have to wander and to be scared was an insult to Jehovah if a man wants under the blood feels afraid that God won't keep his word it's an insult to him and you say Jehovah perhaps this is your word but I don't know whether it's right or not I think about the prophet God is saying one you under the blood you cannot take God at his word it's an insult to Jehovah when you're looking at your circumstances and you're weighing them against the promises of God and your circumstances way more than the promises of God it's an insult to Jehovah because you are a doubting that he's able to keep his word you're taking the truth of God's word for a lie because if you die you're saying you don't believe that he's able to bring you to pass therefore you don't believe that he can't keep his word you make him a liar the characteristics of God's word is that the things that he has declared must come to pass and if he doesn't come to pass it wasn't his word that's how you know it's the word of God if he comes to pass now God wouldn't allow a man to speak a lie in his name because that does great damages to his reputation you say his reputation a problem talks about this for the sake of time I'm not going to go through any details but it says that there's wanted to build a bridge in Sydney Australia and I wanted to find a great Builder they wanted the best builder and they decided to build this bridge across the Great Street of water and it came down to a renowned contractor who had a reputation behind him that he could do it it was expensive when the people didn't care because they wanted something of quality and but everyone says and I think every Christian ought to take the same attitude that's right we want to know where we're standing we don't want our Eternal destination built upon the shifting Sands of some church theology but on the Eternal Word of the Living God because remember every one of you sitting here tonight stormy time is going to hit that building that you're setting in tonight that's right death is going to strike it and you better know what kind of sin it's built upon or what kind of foundation it has God building the foundation will put nothing else but the best that there is because God is thoughtful of his reputation think about that statement God is thoughtful God cares about his reputation God cares about what people think about him so the reason why God gave that law to the children of Israel put him to death if somebody come to say that saved the Lord and it's not me kill him because they were damaging my reputation it's going to come to pass that when somebody says that said the Lord the people won't believe it because you'll think that God is not able to keep his word so let it be known that I keep my word I take my reputation seriously if anybody dares to speak in my name will I kill him God takes his reputation seriously now in Numbers Chapter 14 when the people rebel against Moses Moses and Aaron fell before the Tabernacle of the Lord and prayed and pleaded for the people and God comes to Moses and says it says unto Moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be until they believe me for all the sons which I've shown among them I will Smite them with pestilence and this disinter with them and will make thee a great nation and mightier than they and Moses said unto the Lord now listen the Egyptians shall hear it for thou brought us up these people in that might from among them the Egyptian saw your power they saw how you deliver these people if you kill them in the wilderness they will hear about it [Music] and they will tell it to all the inhabitants of the land that they have heard that thou Lord are among his people that Lord you have been seen face to face and that clouds stand up over them and not go as before then by day in the field of cloud and in the period not by night now if Thou shalt kill all these people as one man than the Nations which have heard the fame your reputation which I've heard the theme of them will speak saying because the law was not able to bring his people into the land which is sure unto them therefore he have slain them in the wilderness and now I beseech they let the power of my law be great according as thou has spoken saying the Lord is suffering long-suffering and great of great Mercy pardon I besee the iniquity of your people and the law says I have pardon according to that word but as truly as I live all the years shall be filled with the glory of the Lord I love this this dialogue between God and Moses Moses priests before God and says Lord I understand you're angry I understand you're frustrated but be mindful of your reputation Nations have heard of what you're able to do they've seen your Mighty hand in Israel in Egypt never heard that there's a pill of fire in armies they're heard that is a pill of fighting armies and if you kill your people in the wilderness they will say oh their God was only able to take them this far he couldn't take them all the way and all the nations would start talking about it in other words this will be your new reputation that you are a God who can only go halfway that you cannot keep your word God say oh hold on I'll forgive them but as long as I live all the Earth shall be filled with my glory in other words I will not let any word that I speak fall to the ground I will not let my reputation suffer any damages regardless of the unbelief fine I will forgive them because my world is more important to me than the unbelief my Integrity is more important to me than putting up without belief I'll keep my word for the sake of my own reputation almost somebody intercept tonight like Moses and say Lord if you don't heal me the people that have testified at work saying that God Is A Healer they will hear about this they will hear away how you heal that person and that person but they'll say you're not able to heal me is this what you want your reputation to be Lord that you cannot heal my sickness God says wait a minute I will heal you I will heal you because as long as I leave all the Earth shall know my glory my words will come to pass my reputation will not suffer in Israel the Ark of God had a reputation as soon as the people of Israel brother Arc back all the nations around and fear God because they knew that the Ark in their midst meant that they're invisible then you're in the party of the Ark the power of God in their midst why because it took God years and years of building up a reputation what do you think throughout the church throughout all the Old Testament when God said sign the prophet they said that saved the Lord that saved the Lord that's the of the Lord that said the Lord God is making the Christ so clear this is this is me speaking and everything he speaks comes to pass everything he speaks comes to pass and it starts to build a reputation that everything that God speaks will happen and the people start building up confidence in the word of God because they know that God is able to keep it God is doing all of that to help your faith to help you believe because if you can only get you to believe what did the angel of the Lord said to brother Branham if you can get the people to believe the issue is not the word it's all powerful it's omnipotent the issue is our faith God Son of prophet with a gift to help them believe God put gifts in the church to help you believe God put minutes on the pulpit to help you believe so that you can get your faith right on the word of God that all things are possible to you if you can believe what am I doing tonight by preaching the word helping you believe that's the sister who came to prayer line but everyone was praying for a brother and another brother and sister came he says you don't have to be nervous it's okay it's a nervous spirit and it's all over the congregation how many have a nervous period people raise their hand so I'm just trying to tell you that God is here he knows all about you and I believe you're going to be healed as they said it says frankly I'd like to pray for you because you're not healed what happened he said that shadow has left you he didn't lay hands on her he didn't pray for her he was speaking to her but he got her faith he helped her faith and once her faith reached that level that it met the requirements of God that Spirit left on its own because somebody battling in his Spirit tonight I select your faith rise up and let your heart declare Lord be unto me according to the words to speaking and as sure as God is God I don't have to lay hands on you I don't have to cast that demand from you it will live on its own because you meet the requirements of God [Music] how many have I'm fully gorgeous on inspiration now forget about my notes how many have ever feel a form on a web page or he says put your first name put your last name put your email address and then click next but you cannot click next until you fill out the form how many know what I'm talking about right you can't click you try to click it's disabled and they want you to fill all the requirements so you go ahead and put your name you put your last name you put your phone number you put your email and all of a sudden that button you couldn't click on it before it's not activated you cannot click on it it's not accessible to you why because you met requirements it's not up to you to choose what you want to leave the page or you want to go next that option wasn't there before you couldn't do anything before but when the requirements are met it's not up to you to choose do I want to go on or do I want to leave this webpage there's the promises of God and the power of God has to lose to the church but that's not accessible to you until you meet the requirements what are the requirements face when you come to a point where you met the requirements by believing in the word of God it's not accessible to you in other words it's up to you what you want to do you can stay in a wheelchair or you can get up and walk you can stay blind or you can get up and see you can keep that arthritis in your body or you can stretch your hand and be whole it's up to you because once you met the requirements of God the power is loose unto you Isaiah 46 11 here I've spoken it I will bring it to pass Jeremiah 4 28 because I've spoken it I purpose it I will not repent I will not turn my back on it Ezekiel 5 13 they shall know that the Lord have spoken it Ezekiel 5 15 add the Lord have spoken it Ezekiel 17 24 I had the Lord have spoken it and I've done it many personal scriptures I the Lord have spoken it I have done it I've spoken it as God wants you to know he's the one doing the speaking and if this is the one doing the speaking he will bring it to pass I'm going to close with this so we talked about Brahman says if you can only say it on your mind what this is and who spokeless and we spoke about who spoke this the amen of God he's the one who spoke in this let's talk about what this is what this word is when Moses goes down into Egypt he goes speaking things into existence right the place he calls the Flies and all the different things that happen in Egypt the prophet of God I don't know whether Moses realized it or not at the time that what was actually happening was created Power but the prophet of God in this age tells us that creative power came out of his mouth he says if he didn't speak the word into existence where did he get the material to make it out where did it come from sure he did he spoke it in existence because it's the word of God the very dirt and things that you're setting on today is the creative word of God the word of God Is Creative power so when Moses comes out of Egypt and God begins to deal with him to write the five books of the Bible Genesis to Deuteronomy and God gives him a front row seat at that kind of creation we know he's a prophet and now Moses starts to see how God from the words the heavens and the Earth and this this is why bless me this is pretty powerful to me to see this because when God Appears to Moses in the people of fire in Exodus chapter three once it doesn't know much of his God what do you heard from his parents as Brother Thompson said on Sunday he only had some knowledge of it but he didn't know him but he knew Egyptians God right because he was raised pagan so when God Appears to Moses Moses is having an encounter with God and he's trying to realize oh this is the god that I heard about and he's he's the pill of Fire he said this is the god that we heard about he's the god of Abraham and asking Jacob his name is I am Moses began to be acquainted with this God and as God uses Moses to deliver the people God is unfolding more of himself to Moses and to the people so when Moses spoke does fly and they came Moses like wow this girl is powerful wow he can bring flies like that Moses through his his rod and turned into a snake wow this God is powerful these are the things that he's able to do Moses struck the water and turn into blood wow and Moses is starting to experience the power of God now God tells Moses to come I'm going to show you creation now Moses starts to write in the beginning God said let there be light and there was Moses is watching God's creative power at work now this God of us mysterious is not revealing something special to Moses oh my it's not revealing to Moses The Secret of my power is in my word I'm catching it catch it he's not revealing to Moses I'm the all-powerful God you've seen me do these things in Egypt you saw what I'm able to do but now let me show you I'm going to reveal to you where all my power Lays it was a mystery to you before it was a mystery to the children of Israel before they only knew that I was a powerful God they knew that I was able to do this and that but now I'm going to show you how I'm able to do these things Moses the power or the secret of my power is my word when I say something it comes to pass and Moses is there watching he's like oh my God is the secret of his power the thing that makes this God unlike every other God is his word the kingdom makes him above all the other gods is his word the reason why he's able to do this fix is his word and then he says wait a minute that means that when I spoke in Egypt it was his word oh my God I began to point out this from the team to think that Moses coming to that realization wait a minute when I spoke in Egypt that means that was his word the same creative word that created heaven on Earth was the same words that he put in my mouth and when I speak the word I spoke God's thoughts he is stressing me with the secret of his power I feel like shouting but not even enough what's left in me The Secret of his power is his word if somebody can catch it tonight like Samson they knew what his power could do he's able to kill this field of sins he's able to do that he's going to carry a gate the line of Samson tell me the secret of your power see they knew what Samsung could do but I didn't know what the secret was and the secret of something was his hair and Samsung revealed it to the wrong person and here God is revealing to Moses what makes me almighty God what makes me all-powerful what sets me aside from all the other gods Wife puts me in a complete different category than all your Idols of Egypt is my word thank you The Secret of my power is in my world Moses write it in the Bible say in the beginning God said so that the people will know that my word is power you may not grasp it but there's one person who understands it really well it's the devil he knows all too well the power of God is in his word why do you think every Church any attacks the word because the source of power that's why the prophet of God says that the Holy Ghost was bound throughout the church ages by Chris and dogmas right because the devil attacked the word and by mixing the word with men's Christians and dogmas he rendered it of non-effect in other words he removes the power out of it by God's not a prophet in this last days to Aristotle work to you why because in the restoration of the word is the resurrection of power you'll think this message is Doctrine no sir you say this message is just baptizing right no sir you think this message is addressed God a code of conduct a compilation of scriptures and good testimonies now the message of the hour is the secret of God's power restored to the church which is the word which is the seven Thunders which is the opening of the seals which is a shot at midnight that's your body change that's your rapture that's your healing that's your deliverance it's the word if I don't want to get you to believe in the world they'll be everybody here at Hill tonight and because what I'm saying is the word of God let him perform the things that I speak [Applause] delivered to testify to the word is true this addiction that you'll see you'll see them no more and go home what are you fire in the body because of what it's true then unbelief believe the people tonight that demon of fine belief I come against it in the name of Jesus Christ lost the people people believe The Secret of his power is in his word [Applause] it's not in songs it's not in music it's not an emotions it's not in man-made dogmas it's in his word what's going to restore your family don't worry what's going to change your body don't worry what's going to forgive your sins don't worry what's going to set you free the word [Applause] what are we exhausting tonight don't worry what is God exalted Above All Things his word he's the amen of God so oh Lord I wish I must strengthen me tonight somebody believe tonight humbly believe it tonight EPA do you believe it tonight if you only realize who spoke this word and that this word is created Power you can go back home completely huh you can open the pages of your Bible tonight and read that it could only see who spoke his words Hallelujah anybody here with sense of depression we can go on freaking night the word the seek off his power is his word anybody wanted something of God tonight I don't know what you are somebody wanting a family the secret of the power is in the word you're on the family restored the secret of God's powers in the word there's a word that does it if you can only celebrate it in your mind all God help me tonight if I have a gift like the prophet I'll call you up here and I began to tell you things about yourself perhaps that will help your faith a little bit but take me and my word tonight because I'm not speaking my own words I'm thinking the thoughts of God if you can believe in this if you don't believe in this you wouldn't believe the prophet was here because brother says that the word of God is a primary way of God speaking gifts are secondary speaking in tongues prophecy Vision they're secondary primarily God speak through his word God won't give you a substitute because the word is the best he can give you lay a word of the word of God tonight and rest upon the word is created Power it's the secret of God's power Amen to the word feel on it be it unto me alone let the ones that you have spoken happen to me let them happen to me he said you're going to change my body let it happen to me you say you can clean me and make me whole let it happen to me two blind man come to Jesus and said Lord have mercy one of Jesus Son of David

to Jesus and say Lord remember me remember my day Jesus said it's not made to give the children's bread to dogs I don't have time to go into that quote my brother mama said she accepted what the word

have the faith of a dog give me the crumbs stop it I'm a dog stop it Hallelujah Hallelujah oh sister got the angel Lord in this room tonight because God always backs up his word the reason why you're charging yourself is the father being witness to your son and what is true and you'll bring it to pass in your life the same God I spoke to William Brothers said you touch your hands that'll be the first bull if you're sincere you're able to discern the thoughts that'll be your second pull it will come to pass then the opening of what will happen that'll be your third pool didn't come to pass first will happen second will happen purple happen God keeps his word he wanted you to know I'm without Prophet I'm with that messenger you pay attention to the things he says because I'm gonna back

service and girl began to deal with me about certain things that he'd spoken to me and I wasn't sure whether those things would come to pass because of choices I made in my life and I came here when everybody left and I prayed at this altar and I said Lord I failed you miserably but these are the things you've spoken to me please what will happen to those things that you've spoken about not that I didn't keep my end of the bargain I want to message where you are am I going to open my bible he fell on Psalms 89 I believe and it said the words that have come out of my mouth I will not alter them my Covenant with you will like it I've held on to those words all these years because I know he met me here I know and he told me that the words that came out of his mouth he would not alter them because of what I did he will not change them because of my decision he said my Covenant with you will I keep because I am God and I keep my worth trust in you trust in the word tonight Hallelujah do you mind closing the word of Prayer I have left in me Hallelujah Lord Jesus Lord how can we close Lord at the moments like this where you brought your word forth Lord where you brought your people to a place Lord where they can just claim Lord Lord it feels like even at this moment Anything Could Happen Lord you don't bring Lord a word to your servant you don't bring your people to this place not just to drop off and let us walk out a door so Lord we want you to still stir and move here in this service Lord we're not going to Lord dismiss in prayer and just walk out a door but Lord would you still move tonight don't you you've brought us to a place Lord somebody maybe just needs to sit and allow that word now to stir Lord to where maybe in their heart they're saying amen but Lord their mouth needs to now confess that you are indeed the Amen in their situation oh God so Lord tonight would you brood now would you continue to deal with the hearts of your people Lord we're not closing this service but maybe you're just beginning to stir maybe you're just beginning to move oh God may we have this sensitivity Lord if you're Spirit Lord within has not not to disrupt not to move away but Lord just to start to enter in at this very moment when you're dealing with your people oh God maybe tonight would be one of those all-night prayer meeting type of nights when Lord you're moving in the midst of your people and we can just be shut in with God in his secret place Lord whatever you're speaking whatever you're dealing whatever you're bringing somebody to a certain place where Lord the answer that you've been speaking to them is now going to come to manifestation because their heart is screamed out Amen to the word of God so Lord we pray tonight you just move with us Lord deal with the Lord is if someone must leave it so be it but Lord we stay in your presence tonight as we say Amen to the word of God and now let it bring forth May that creative power that Moses experienced by watching you by Vision take the Earth and start to form may it form in the in the bodies of your people oh God we pray in Jesus Christ name go with your people Lord as we now just wait and brewed in your presence in Jesus Christ's name amen amen foreign I wish I knew what to do at this very moment maybe I could say something else I could help you but the quote that we read in the beginning I lie not when I say that I've not been able to escape from it it's the Holy Ghost was emphasizing to me that this was tonight what he wanted to tell the church if you can only settle in your mind what this word is and who spoke this word there's no reason why you should walk away the same I don't know about you but I just happen to believe the prophet I believe what he says because I know it's not his words the thoughts of God's spoken through a man it's Immortal power coming through moral lips the same happened tonight the thoughts of God creating power coming through moral leaps if you can settle in your mind that the person I spoke to you is not your brother beyond the pulpit it's almighty God how dare you go back on the same let me challenge you how dare you go back home to sin take all his word tonight there's no reason why you need to go back home with that same sickness if you can only settle in your mind who spoke this word and what this word is May the attitude of your soul be amen being unto me Lord feel free to do as the Lord as the Lord and spirit leads you God bless you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music]
