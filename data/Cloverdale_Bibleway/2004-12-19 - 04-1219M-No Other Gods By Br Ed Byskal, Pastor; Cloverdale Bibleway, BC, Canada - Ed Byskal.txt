If you're listening in on the internet, you just lift your heart before the Lord. He hears knows our requested before we ask. Amen. Heavenly Father, we're thankful this morning, Lord Jesus, that we can approach you, Lord, for you are the true and living God, a God who is most holy, Lord. And Lord Jesus, we desire that holy presence amongst us this morning, Lord. Father, we can get ourselves out of the way that we can push aside the flesh. We can push aside our spirits, Lord, and enter into thy spirit, Lord. For they that worship you must worship you in spirit and in truth, Lord. And how we love to worship you, Lord. When we think of what you've done for us, Lord, when we think of where we once were. &gt;&gt; We think of the amazing grace that picked us up, Lord, when we were deep in sin. Oh God, for the the gift of grace, Lord Jesus, that has changed our lives, &gt;&gt; Lord. We have much to thank you for, Lord. We have much to be appreciative of, Lord God. And we want to give you the praise, Lord God. We want to open up our hearts, Lord. I pray, dear God, you'd even give us utterance, Lord Jesus, just to express, Lord, all that you've done for us, Father. Words fail us, Lord. But how we want to say, Lord Jesus, we love you. &gt;&gt; How we love you, dear God. We appreciate you. We adore you, Lord God. And how we want, Lord Jesus, our lives, just not our voices, but our lives to praise you. We want our lives to be a sweet smelling savior in your nostrils, Lord, that our prayers would ascend up to the throne of grace, Lord. Father, mix with that incense, Lord God, of faith and praise, Lord God, that you would hear the needs of your children this morning, Lord. Father, each one of us are needy, Lord. Each one of us has a need, Lord, in our lives. Father, many are more needy than others, Father. But dear God, no matter what the need, whether it be great or small in our eyes, Lord, Father, they're all important to you. For Lord, you're caring for us. You love us, Lord. You want what's best for us. And Lord Jesus, we approach you this morning, Lord, with these many needs. Father God, we know that you're more than able to comfort those that need comforting, Lord, of Brother Danny Dundo losing his wife, dear God. Lord Jesus losing a part of himself, a part of his life, dear God, a part of his existence here. Lord, the next best thing out of salvation that you can give a man, Lord, is a godly wife. And Lord, for whatever reason, you've taken her home, Lord. We pray this time you'll give our brother strength, dear God. Lord, as he's now, Lord, alone without his wife, we pray that you'll comfort him and give him strength in the upcoming days, dear God. May he find his strength, Lord, his anchor in Christ, Lord. that you Lord God will carry them through this difficult time Lord Jesus for the ones that are in need of healing Lord whether in the body Lord whether in their spirit and their soul dear God we pray that you go to each one Lord remember Shelly dear God that you will deliver her dear God our brother Norm Wood's request Lord for loved ones that you will deliver them dear God from sickness and Father deliver them from sin dear God loved ones that we have on our hearts dear God we desire that Jesus Christ would be made known known to our loved ones, Lord. For dear God, we're not satisfied, dear God, with anything less, Lord God, but for their salvation. That they would be, Lord Jesus, brought into the light of the gospel of this day, Lord. Father, they would see Jesus Christ in us, dear God, their loved ones. That we would bring Christ to them, Lord. And Father, that you would grant them eternal life, Lord, on this side, Father, grant them, Lord Jesus, being a bride, the bride of a part of the bride of Jesus Christ. Lord, we don't claim for anything less than that, Lord. Oh, Father, we just reach up high, dear God, to the promises of God that are laying before us. Lord Jesus, remember, Brother Ern in the Philippines, Lord, dear God, picking up the pieces after the the fire there, Lord. But Lord Jesus, you're more than able to restore all things even greater than it was, Lord. And we're expecting it, Father. We know all these hap all these things happened, dear God, for our good, Lord Jesus. Pray for the uplifted hands, Lord, here in our presence, Lord God. Those on the internet, and the phone hookup, those that even partake of this service, Lord, in the archives, or the videos, Lord Jesus, you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Your presence ever abides with us, dear God. May you intend to the need of each one. Lord, the heart's desire that you've had on your that you've laid upon your people's heart, Lord, and the the word that you have placed upon our pastor to speak to us this morning, Lord Jesus, how we need to hear it this morning. We need to hear what the spirit is saying to the bride. Not a man, Lord God, but the presence, the angel of the Lord, that has gone before us, Lord, to prepare our way in this hour. Lord, give us tender hearts as we would worship you. Lord, as we would sing these songs to create an atmosphere, Lord, where the seed can be watered, Lord, where bring forth much fruit, Lord Jesus, I pray that the servant this morning, Lord, our pastor will have liberty, Lord. Not bound by time, not bound by what he thinks or what the people are thinking, Lord. &gt;&gt; But dear God, this is an hour from which we need to get ourselves out of the way. We need to lay everything aside, dear God. &gt;&gt; Lord, it's getting to be that rapturing moment, Lord, that rapturing time when we'll be changed, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we need that faith, Lord, that for that translation. &gt;&gt; So, I pray, dear God, you'll give it to us this morning, Lord. Line upon line, precept upon precept, Lord. &gt;&gt; From glory to glory, Lord God, we wait upon you this morning. &gt;&gt; Bless the songs that we sing, Lord. Bless the musicians, the song leader, dear God. God, &gt;&gt; Lord, all things that will be said and done, may it be for your glory, for your honor and praise as you commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You may be seated. We want to take the time to welcome all those who are visiting with us. I understand that uh little Lavel Shepard and his wife Sister Lorraine uh as and uh their son brother Terry Shepard and his wife Tina and uh their children are here with us this morning. May we get you to stand up and so everybody can welcome down to Ron Brother Ron Peterson Church. Amen. God bless you. Happy to have you here. Amen. And if uh any others are visiting with us, we want to make sure that you know we real welcome here in the church. Uh we've got one announcement for tonight. Um, the Bible Way Christian Academy Children's Choir will be singing tonight and all of the school children must be here at the church by 4:30 wearing black and white, no color, I guess. Um, and also those adults that are singing with them, please come at 4:30 as well. and um meeting schedule for uh coming up. I know it's a busy time for everyone and time when uh you're spending a lot of time with family and uh and uh different ones and um so this uh the schedule's been posted actually for a while, but maybe you're like me and I never read the bulletin board. Uh, so I I uh thought that uh I should read it out so everyone knows. Next Sunday, which is December the 26th, there will be one service only. It's going to be 10:30 in the morning. Wednesday, December 29th, there won't be any service, but we will be having a Friday night service, our watch night service, which we uh it's a wonderful time. I look forward to it each and every year. Um, and that's going to happen at 9:00 on December the 31st. And then Sunday, January the 2nd, there's going to be one service only again at 10:30. So, uh, we are looking to have a wonderful time. And I know it's always a time over the the Christmas season, the holiday season when you have a chance to spend some real quality time with uh with your relatives. and uh and we'll pray that God will make you a real testimony for them. Um as well, I know the watch night service is a time when there's a lot of specials. So, if you could help me out in particular, uh if you have a song that you want to sing and I just really um have enjoyed some of the children over the enjoyed hearing some of the children that we don't hear very often and they practice, they get a chance they're out of school and they practice up for the watch night service. So, if you have a song that you'd like to sing or your children would like to sing, if you could please contact Sister Bonnie uh in the office and we'd ask you to do that before noon on Friday, before noon on December the 24th. If you could let her know and then she'll get all the information to me and we can get everything put together for the watch night service, we would really appreciate that a lot. Amen. Um, Hark the Herald Angel Sing. It's number 2375. We would stand together. Some of these songs, you know, you could come into our house sometimes, maybe in July, and hear the stereo going and you'll hear Christmas music. Uh, some of these songs are wonderful songs. And, uh, you don't need to just sing it this time of year. This song, I believe, was written by Charles Wesley, who was the brother of John Wesley, church age messenger. And uh I tell you there's a real message in this song. So let's sing it out. Amen. Sing the top of your lungs. Amen. I look sometimes and I see some people look at me. Their lips are hardly moving. Open your lips loud, wide, and sing to the Lord. Amen. Don't sing for me, but sing to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hark the angels sing. Glory to you for me. Peace on earth and mercy. God, joy for all the angels. Join the tri of the sky. [Applause] Christ is born. Oh, the herald angels sing. Glory to the new king. My highest and thast.

We've come this morning to adore him. &gt;&gt; And he's the only one that's worthy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to lift him up in the highest place. &gt;&gt; Amen. We had a wonderful time really last evening with the young people and uh brother Tom directed in a certain thought and then brother Murphy spoke to the young people told of his youth and told of being in China and having never heard the name of Jesus Christ. And I was very very impressed as he spoke to the young people and all of you that were there last evening. Uh I was I was very impressed with the fact that he said it was the young people when he arrived here at the church having come from a godless nation arrived here at the church. He said it was your lives that preached to me. and uh he said and so I come tonight respecting you and I really think I don't know if it took the young people by surprise but it took me by surprise and I thought it was such an honor to have a a brother as brother Murphy is so affected by the lives of the young people and uh I think that uh the Young people want to be mindful that your lives have a big effect on others and you don't want to allow Satan to tamper with your youth. You reserve yourself and give your best to Jesus Christ. It's been a common statement by people who have a few years that have passed by when they've said, "I only wish I'd heard it earlier. I only wish I had come earlier. I wish I had given the best of my life and the best of my youth and my strength." So serve him with all your heart. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it was a lovely evening. And we have a note here also. I know that many of you many of you have been praying for uh Sharon Hunt. And so we have a a note that the Hunt and the Vanenter families would like to thank everyone who thought and prayed for Sharon at this time. Sharon had major surgery to remove a large but benign cyst from her brain and she is recovering remarkably well and will be home early next week. The Lord willing. We give all thanks to the Lord who has sheltered us under his wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we want you to rejoice uh with the Hunt and Vanenter families. Amen. Turn in your Bibles if you would to Exodus. And while you're turning, we're just going to sing that song uh if you would please. Uh I place you in the highest place. I praise you in the highest place. [Music] For you are my great I [Music] and we come to you and worship at glory. We can all join our hearts together once again. We praise you. Yes, in the highest place [Music] for you. I praise you. I [Music] [Applause] amen. And we come. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Exodus the 20th chapter. We're going to read the first six verses. And God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, and out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness, or anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. &gt;&gt; Let's just pray one more time. Father, this is your word. We start out with the words and God said. Lord, we know that you have spoken in this day. And we can we can say and God has said. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we thank you for the words not of a man but of God. And you are not ashamed to identify yourself with your word. You're not ashamed to confirm it with the supernatural. And you are a supernatural God. And all that you do is supernatural. You have worked in each of our lives in a supernatural way or we could not be here today. You delivered us from the shackles of sin and from the reign of death and darkness. Oh God, you've delivered us from the dismal life of sin and unbelief. And you've given us hearts to believe and we cannot be anything other than what you have made us to be. We've come here to glorify you. Now we pray that we will be you will be glorified in the ministry of your word and that the people you'll be glorified amongst them Lord as they believe your word and may the Holy Spirit have preeminence in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you may be seated. Nice to see you all this morning, this lovely day. and uh to all that are listening and streaming with us. I uh just looked at some of the names and the places just yesterday to see uh you know from what countries and really it is really quite amazing when you sing and when you worship and when you praise the God of our redemption it's it's uh I want you to be mindful that there's people in countries all around the world that are uh listening with you and rejoicing with you and participating feeding on the body word of the son of man with you today and may God bless them. The scripture which we have read today uh God speaking to the children of Israel and I thought when I read this thou shalt have no other gods before me. I'm following along in the same series of in his steps but I are taking for a subject today no other gods. Uh you would have thought that that kind of a commandment would have been given to uh the Hebrews, the children of Israel in Egypt when they were in a a a nation of heathen gods. You would have thought that that's where God would have given that commandment rather than after they've been taken out and delivered with a mighty hand and they they're out now in the wilderness. You would think that in that kind of an environment it wouldn't be so necessary to say to them, you shall have no other gods. when you think of that. But you know there is there is one principle there is a thing that is very very uh uh it's consistent through the scripture and that is that when God makes himself known when God reveals himself to the people that is the time that the people are most susceptible they become God conscious. They see God doing things and they become, you know, like we are a people of revelation. You never hear a a people speak so much about revelation and being revelated as it is amongst the believers of the message. And that makes a person susceptible to as soon as you hear about revelation or I got a revelation or or this is a mighty revelation. You know, your ears right away are perked up because you want to hear because you've been attuned to that. And now God came and showed himself to Israel as a God of might and and a God of deliverance. And now they've had the mana in the wilderness. They've had water from the rock. They've had uh walked out on dry land through things that we can't even hardly imagine. And they they actually lived it. They experienced it. They drank that water. They ate that mana. They walked through that dry ground. They saw the water walled up. They saw the huge mighty army of the Egyptians. They saw it destroyed. They saw the hand of God. They lived through the plagues of Egypt. and they had walked out with this uh mighty deliverance. And the Bible speaks of it throughout the scripture in many places that it was with a mighty hand that God delivered them. And he just nicely gets them out in this wilderness and says to them, "You'll have no other gods before me." You'd think, "Why would God say that to me? What other god would I have besides this kind of a god? What other God would I have than a God that delivered me and has just done all these things? But God knew that in revealing himself to the people, in making himself known, they became susceptible to having other gods. And it didn't take very long because here when God is speaking that they're down there making a calf &gt;&gt; already making a calf saying make us a calf and let these be the gods the gods that will go before us that brought us out of Egypt. There's uh there has to be a genuine before there's a counterfeit. And that's why this principle applies. &gt;&gt; And we I'm speaking this because we're a people that speak of the fullness of the coming of the word in this day. &gt;&gt; And you can be sure that Satan has an allout frontal attack more subtle than we're perhaps uh think of on a day-to-day basis. more subtle and coming from more directions. But yet, oh, we have the we have the the comfort and the confidence that the bride won't be deceived. But it doesn't mean that we won't be harassed. We won't it doesn't mean that we won't be attacked from every direction. And the scriptures been given to us so that we are forewarned ahead of time and so that we are on the alert. And the prophet still talks about us knowing our enemy and studying his tactics and knowing how he works and knowing how he attacks so that we're ready that we're fortified. And that's why we have to preach this way. &gt;&gt; And who do you say this is? A 64 message. He says they followed the pillar of fire to the promised land. Those that went all the way through did. the others perished. He said, notice they wanted the word mixed with the world. &gt;&gt; They wanted it both ways. &gt;&gt; And he said, cause caused them, this caused them to air because they wanted it mixed. They wanted the word that they had received mixed with the world. And that caused them to air. And notice what it did to them. He said they missed it because they wouldn't accept the anointed word. First, you have to have the real one to make a counterfeit off of it. And that is why the other gods always come after the revelation of God. Yeah. You have a message like this and then people get all taken up and say, "Oh, these went off and they've got, you know, they're identified with the message and they're believing this and oh, such weird stuff and such." It the the genuine had to come first. had to come first and then all these things can come. But none of these things move me. &gt;&gt; None of these things will move the bride. The ones that keep the word, the word, remember now when the word came, that was when they knew who God was. And that when truth comes, that's when a person can worship the true God in a true way. In the token he said Satan has thrown all kinds of counterfeits. Notice what he talks about as counterfeits of shaking hands of evidences and everything like that. He said forget it. The hour has arrived that the token itself capital I a person the token itself not some counterfeit makebelieve substitutionary anything. The hour is here when the token himself &gt;&gt; has is identifying himself right among us and proving that he is the same Jesus yesterday, today, and forever. And he's right with the word. He is the word. &gt;&gt; But when he makes himself known, that's when bogus counterfeits can arrive on the scene. And and and the world's got plenty of them. And we need to preach like this. We need to be forewarned about these things so that we don't just jump and run after this that or the other thing. We just go straight forward with the with the gospel that has been brought to us. The word that God confirmed and it is a supernatural gospel. &gt;&gt; He said if you see a bogus dollar, we all have. We've heard bogus message. We all have. No doubt. Then you know there's a genuine. &gt;&gt; You know there's a counterfeit. Somebody says, "Oh, well there's so many hypocrites in the church. That's why I'm not going there anymore." You've just reduced yourself below the hypocrite. &gt;&gt; You've just had a hypocrite stop you from something good. &gt;&gt; You just had a hypocrite dictate to your life. &gt;&gt; And to me, that doesn't keep a person that that doesn't raise a person in my in my uh image very much because they say, "Oh, there's hypocrites in the church." Well, uh you don't want to be one that uh uh you don't want to be one that has a hypocrite dictate to you what you're going to do &gt;&gt; in the message be certain of God. Incidentally, one of my one of my favorite messages and the reason why when a person has I've said to people that stood right here with serious illness said there's two things that I recommend you do and you you you arrive at a time that is a serious time for you. You want to remember these two things. Number one, follow the word of God to the letter. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says if you I if any man be afflicted, let him pray. &gt;&gt; Is any sick, let him call. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it is not if any man's afflicted, let him hope that the preacher will run to him. If any man's afflicted, any woman's afflicted, you pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you're sick, you call. And that's how God works. And the second thing is in the message, be certain of God. I recommend that you take that, carry that, read that, hold it on your person, keep it in your case, keep it in your car, keep it in the tape deck, and you hear a prophet saying how many times he said, "I've gone back and turned over every stone." And still, when he remains silent, then you have to be certain that he's God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ah that's wonderful. And in that message he said and it's a very he said it's a very picture of our country today. We have fallen under the popular demand. &gt;&gt; No doubt that the priests thought it would be all right as long as their government okayed it. But he says I don't care what the governments. It's got to be what Gods. And the people thought that it would be all right if they anticipated uh anticipated in some uh some of the worldly things. And one might ask me to retrace what I just what I have just said. He said that is a that is a very likely picture of today. He said we may not think that we are idol worshippers. speaking to a a nation now and he's speaking to a lot of believers. He says, "But we are." And the government endorses it. People today are idol worshippers because they worship idols. Some of them worship movie stars for idols. And I trust there's no one here. Now, we may think, I just want you to get where I'm coming from, may think, well, I don't fall down. I don't prostrate myself. But I guess that's not the point. The critical point is this, hear me, is is there or does some of these whether they they're godless people, whether they would be a movie star or a politician or a a sports star or some Olympic star or something else? Do they influence the individual to the degree that they veer off the standard of the word of God? &gt;&gt; And if they do, then they are calling they are demanding out from you a focus a a respect that should be going to God. And if they do, that individual who's being persuaded, who's being influenced, who's digressing from the a a clearcut commandment of God, the covenant of God, that person is in danger of bowing down to that per that individual, which becomes an idolatrous act rather than to God himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is made known by his word. &gt;&gt; And God has made his word very very I would say abundantly clear. And so then he said some of them worship movie stars for idols. Brother Brandham talks like but the waterhead waterhead haircut or the hairdo that the women had in his time. Well, you don't see it today but it didn't. And it was all over in front of him. It was everywhere. It was acceptable. It was the in thing at that time for the ladies and no one really took an issue with it. But he raised it up. And I'll tell you one thing, it perhaps not so much the design of it, not so much the design of it, but the source of it. &gt;&gt; It came from a politician's wife. It came from the wife of the president, I believe. And that's how it had influenced a nation. And so that is what we have to see. What is the source of it? Where did it come from in the first place? And so he said some of them worship movie stars for idols. Some worship money for idols. Some worship television stars as idols. But all that you put before God, and here we have it. All that you put before God is, let it be, whatever it might be, it is an idol. &gt;&gt; All that you put before God. And so then some say, well, I'm not able to serve God. I'm not able I I I know that's what the word says. I know that's what the message says. But but this and the other thing, and this is very reasonable, and that is that's very essential. That's very actually I can say it's almost necessary but not quite necessary. You know there are things that seem so important to us but you just get struck down with sickness once &gt;&gt; and everything that's important just faded away. &gt;&gt; I can tell you I had a I have a granddaughter. She's in the hospital today and we're so thankful she'll be coming out Lord willing maybe tomorrow the next day. But you know, you're just here. You you you just rise up. You get up in the morning and everything's just fine. You're just on your you're getting ready for, you know, whatever whatever. And uh and suddenly everything's changed. &gt;&gt; Everything's changed. And everything that you had all scheduled that was so vital, so important. Oh, you couldn't set that aside for nothing. You You set it aside. You set it aside real quick and you maybe spent your time in the emergency ward at the at the hospital. Nice to see you, Brother Frank. And I understand you were there last night. I'm glad you're here. I wondered about you this morning. Praise God. But it it can change your it will change your uh agenda real quick. &gt;&gt; Real quick. And things that are so important. Oh, they're so important. and the plans and the preparations and the things and the obligations and the responsibilities and all of those things. You only have to hear one little short phrase and it's all gone. &gt;&gt; It's just not important anymore. &gt;&gt; I know brother Bob Hansen, you got up of a morning and he's a busy man. I'll tell you what, everything that he had scheduled was rearranged very suddenly. Not very long ago, it was all changed. Events just simply have a way. And let me say this, you're strong, healthy, youthful, perhaps beautiful, mature, family, secure, all the rest of it. That can change in just a moment. &gt;&gt; In just a moment. And your world is turned upside down. Is that not true? And that is why we want to live with our feet solidly planted upon the word of God in this hour. Because that person whose feet are planted upon the word of God, they shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away. &gt;&gt; Not the blessings. The blessings come and the blessings go. Not some of these other things or or the emotion or the good feeling or whatever more. They come and they go and the material things come and go. But my word is forever settled in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Once truth is revealed, that is when all of the counterfeit can come on. Jesus said to the woman at the well, "You worship, you know not what? For salvation is of the Jews." He says, "But the hour cometh, and now is when true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father seeketh such to worship him." They had a pleasant, you know, this happens just on a regular basis, but just on Wednesday, it just finished and that that was my text, I believe. That was the text and I just walked out into the foyer of the church and brother Steve Ryus Rivas met me and he said, "This is so unusual this morning." He said this came to me but the father seeketh such to worship him and he said I was so gripped with that he is seeking God is seeking such to worship him he's actually seeking this kind of worshipper and he says I was so gripped with the I I needed to understand that he said I was going to call you I going to call brother Tom and ask you to please expound on this because I needed to know what that meant and what he didn't know was that was not my text. I had a series of other scriptures to lead into my message at the last service. And and as I was coming closer to the service, I thought somehow that is not the scripture that I'm to read. And the scripture I'm to read is God seeketh such to worship him. And I I changed the scripture completely and approached it from another direction. And here a brother in the church was looking to God saying, "I need to I need to minister to expound on that." Doesn't God know our individual individual needs? It just it it's so kind of him to do that. He said, "God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." Now, Jesus did not preach a sermon to the woman about this mountain or about Jerusalem. He didn't preach a woman. He didn't preach a sermon to the woman concerning how she should worship and what was wrong with the worship and and and who God was and all the rest of it. All he did, and here's the principle once again, he just unveiled who the anointed word was. He just kept drawing her in until she saw who the Messiah was. And who when she saw who the Messiah was, who the word was, her worship was automatic. Hallelujah. And she was born of the spirit and of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He just revealed who the word was right in her time. Didn't go back. Well, how this mountain became sacred or how Jerusalem became so sacred to the Jews. He could have gone into a whole lot of history and whole lot of theology. He didn't do anything. He just kept dealing with her, drawing her in, going from the physical, from the water, going to the spirit to the worship part, and then revealing the word himself. And once the word was revealed, she knew, she knew, "Thou art the Christ." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Her worship then could be what it was supposed to be. Now all that appears to be as worship is not necessarily worship. You know we sing and I love singing. I love music and I've never I haven't spent much of my life in uh in the world. We'll be going in a store or a mall or a restaurant. I'll be sitting with, you know, some of you and and just even recently some says, "Oh, that that's a song that was popular when I was in the world." And it comes into their mind and you know, it's it's a it's a memory that they don't really want to have. Doesn't mean a thing to me. I don't even hear it. I don't unless it's obnoxious with its you know it its volume and so on doesn't mean a thing to me and uh and I think that's a wonderful thing if we haven't even got those things in our memory but there's a lot of things that we identify today now listen I want you to hear it a lot of things that we do is in worship you know maybe raise our hands and so on there there's not much in the scripture in the life of Christ that he actually did. We don't have any record that they sang a lot of songs. We don't have any record that they were shouting with praises and so on. We have it in the scripture. The Psalms is full of it and other places in the scripture, but I'm talking about Christ now. There was not a great deal. And yet, hear me. And yet, because this will really define my point this morning. And yet there could be no person that ever lived that more worshiped God in perfection than Christ himself. &gt;&gt; His fellowship with God was immediate. That means at any moment at any time, day or night, his fellowship was immediate. He his life was a was a complete expression of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; He lived in a realm. Brother Brandham says he lived in another world. And it's not that it's in a world that we just can't touch, but it is that he was the living example for us. And so first and foremost is not how you sing or how you praise or how you raise your hand or those things. First and foremost is how you respond to the word of God. That's first and foremost because you can have all the other activity but if the life isn't responding to the word of God, the other becomes quite meaningless and it becomes quite empty. They're singing all over this valley today, all over these cities, all over throughout these churches and music and instruments and choirs and whatever more. And we're not the only people that raise our hands. We're not the only people that clap. We're not the only people that shout. We're not the only people that praise. It's on the lips of multitudes of people. But outside of the word of God, it becomes quite vain and empty. and how we thank God for the living word. And our life must match the word of God. &gt;&gt; Our life, your life is to be in harmony with the word of God. And then I can say even if you haven't uttered anything, you're already worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Your life is a worship to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said about Cain. &gt;&gt; Abel by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice. He didn't have no Bible to go by. So he must have been by revelation. There's revelation to Abel. There was both boys. He said, "If God only requires worship, hear it now. If God only requires worship, then God is unjust to condemn Cain." Cain made an altar. &gt;&gt; Cain built a church. He built a church. He says, "Worshiped and made a sacrifice. Every religious thing that Abel did, so did Cain." Amen. &gt;&gt; But Abel by revelation offered to God. &gt;&gt; He said it is it's a revelation. He said you walk by faith. You walk by faith a more excellent sacrifice. &gt;&gt; You walk by faith &gt;&gt; and faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. and that we walk by that a more excellent sacrifice. &gt;&gt; How did Abel know know that it wasn't fruit of the fields that Cain offered? It was blood that brought them from the garden and life was not in the fruit but blood brought the life. It was revealed to him. &gt;&gt; It was a revelation. So the the main root of worship comes from a relationship that we have as individuals with the word of God. The word of God is a person. &gt;&gt; The word of God is Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Abel's worship was connected to the act of God slaying animals. His worship was connected to an act that God committed &gt;&gt; by slaying an animal to get a to get coverings for his fallen children. &gt;&gt; And so by revelation &gt;&gt; even prior to his birth, he was connected to something that God did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And believe it or not, friends, we're sitting here today. We're worshiping a word that connects us with things with the act of God prior to our even coming here. &gt;&gt; David got so anointed. David now David a friend of God. David an anointed of God. David a king. He was so anointed. He was so enthused and he was going to do the right thing. It was the correct thing. The ark that carried the word was in another place and it needed to come back. The word belonged to be with the people and he got enthused about it. And so now here he consulted the wrong people &gt;&gt; wanting to do the right thing. had the right desire and was the right person &gt;&gt; but he consulted the wrong people. He consulted captains &gt;&gt; of thousands and captains of hundreds and he had men of of stature around him. He had men who had a good in IQ. They had an intelligence and men of experience. And so he consulted them. Uh we need to bring the ark back. Absolutely. Now, you know, we used to carry it on the priest's shoulders, but you know, we've gotten modern today. And we uh these priests, you know, they might stumble, they might fall, they might do there might be damage to the ark. We better make a new cart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We got a We got a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a more sophisticated way of bringing it home. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. So, a new cart is made and they select the oxen and they start pulling it. I tell you what, it wasn't even a twinge in David's mind that anything was wrong. He got out in front of that ark. Was he enthused? He danced before God. This is the greatest thing that's happened in years. Oh, and they rejoiced and they shouted and they praised the God of Israel. They were praising the right person and doing the right thing the wrong way. &gt;&gt; And so, was the worship acceptable? Unfortunately, not. And the Bible says, "And they carried the ark of God in a new cart of the house of Abinadab, and Yuza and Aile drove the cart." Prophet says, "And and David and all Israel played before God," the scripture says, "with all their might." I might add to this respectful audience this morning and all who are listening that they worship God with a force that you haven't experienced this morning. &gt;&gt; I haven't seen anybody and I was watching the monitor in there and this is not to condemn because I'm part of this congregation. I've not yet worshiped this morning with all my might. Have you? &gt;&gt; No. With all their might, they had nothing left. With all their might, they sang. They played. They rejoiced. They worshiped. Oh, what a time. I tell you what. And they weren't. It wasn't anybody say, "Raise your hand." Now, everybody raise their hand. Say, "Praise the Lord." Everybody said, "Praise the Lord." No. They were rejoicing out of the depths of their spirit. The word was coming back. The word was coming back in that little box carrying the covenant, the word of the covenant, the ark of the covenant. Oh, the word was coming back. They were so enthused, but they were also blinded by the fact it was coming the wrong way. &gt;&gt; And it brought death. &gt;&gt; It brought trouble. In fact is it brought David to a I would say a very dangerous place but it it needs to be in the word of God because we need these examples. &gt;&gt; He was he was angry with God. He could not understand why God slew this man when the man when the man and and the ark is coming back and it's coming back the wrong way. But the people are rejoicing. They're so enthused. They're just enthralled with this event and and uh uh you know something very natural happens. The auction stumbles a little bit and the ark starts to tip a wee bit and use he puts out his hand to steady it. He doesn't want it to fall to the ground. This is sacred. This is something wonderful. And God smites him dead. &gt;&gt; You know, it brought a halt to this joyous event. &gt;&gt; And David was mystified. You know, things happen. Sometimes they happen, but you have to really ask yourself, why is it happening? &gt;&gt; Why is it happening? And we need to go back and be certain of God. We need to go back and turn over every stone. And had David gone back to the word, he could have said, "Aha, &gt;&gt; this thing is supposed to come back on the shoulders of the priest. It's not supposed to come back in a new cart. It's not supposed to be pulled by some by some oxen. It's supposed to come back on the shoulders of the appointed ones of God. We've got to get back to the word." In other words, it was the word that would dictate proper worship. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In trying to do God a service, I just want to insert these things so you'll have it reconfirmed from brother Brandham's mouth. And another thing, David here, we see that in his heart he wanted to do something that was good. He had no bad motive or no bad objective. His motive and his objective was correct. But the ark of the Lord was away from the people and he wanted to bring the ark of God back to its place so the people would consult God about the things that they wanted. And he said, "Notice, David got a revelation." And notice, it was not the prophet Nathan that got the revelation. It was David the king that got the revelation. Neither was Nathan consulted about it. He never asked Nathan. But did you see here in First Coronals, he consulted captains of thousands and captains of hundreds. And he never consulted Nathan. He consulted the people. And he consulted also the priests and the theologians of that day and the scribes and the theologians. Now in the congregation, I want to bring this down to today and I'm going to try to watch my time, but it's going to be a little bit difficult. Sometimes we get into some dilemmas. We find ourselves off into some uncomfortable place. And as a believer, I'm sure that you've asked, "Did I get here? Did, you know, did God lead me here? Or did my flesh lead me here? Or did somebody else lead me here? How did I get here? How did I get to where I am at this present state of this situation that I'm in? How did I get here?" and sometimes God allows things. You can live a life of Job and and live a correct life and have have some of Job's experience. You can be a devoted, devout believer. It doesn't mean that everything's going to go smooth. You may enter some very, very rough, trying waters. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean that you need to condemn yourself. But I think it's always good for us to look and say, "How did I arrive here?" Because I find, and this is my experience, I find that believers sometimes get their advice from the wrong source. In fact, is I've had people come back to me not that I'm the right source, but they come back to me after the fact. after getting advice from this one and I phoned that one and I talked with this one and as a uh I finally made a decision or I was advised and counseledled to do a certain thing and they went ahead and did it and the whole thing blew up and then they want you know the pastor to make it all right. I'm sorry it doesn't work that way. &gt;&gt; It works by consulting the word of God first. &gt;&gt; Amen. Should I do this first? Consulting God's word first. &gt;&gt; And then some have come to me and they said now uh uh what does what does the word say about this? I said why don't you read it? &gt;&gt; Why don't you listen to it? &gt;&gt; Why don't you go to the source? &gt;&gt; And in fact is on occasion I've taken you know message books. I said here I found these for you. Here's I know I've marked them for you. Here's the places. Why don't you read it and you see what the prophet of God said and then you'll be able to once you're done come back and and we we can have another conversation. But sometime you know people want they want God to fix something after they have taken counsel from all different sources and have made decisions based on that counsel and then the whole thing blows up and they don't have a they don't have a a positive response and they want God to fix it. I'm sorry. You know, we still reap what we sow. &gt;&gt; And and God has not promised that when we start reaping a bad crop that suddenly he'll fix it. So there is no crop. You know, like brother Ernie says, we people sew their wild oats and then they pray for crop failure. That isn't the way it happens. So, and the fact someone says, "Well, I have a revelation or God, I I I I get real I get real cautious about that because really what I want to know is did they hear from God? Do they hear from God's word &gt;&gt; on this subject?" &gt;&gt; And and because that's where God will be honored with the life. All right. Now I'm going to just take for the next few moments so you see the direction I'm going. I want to just step from Eden to Abraham to the children of Israel on this subject of uh worship and idols and so on. I just want to touch on these and then come to the present time. Now in Eden, the first act, I touched on this the other night. In fact, as I actually focused on it, but the first act of deception, it Satan did not come through the serpent to Eve and say, "Fall down and worship me as Lucifer did to Jesus." But my point is this, that his intention, his desire was the same. And he used the tactic of diverting her attention from the word of God, the covenant of God to them, to Adam and Eve. And based on that covenant, he had fellowship with them. They had fellowship and communion with God. That is worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; He says uh and the first act of deception upon the earth was introduced by a question. And I mentioned to you that you that we're not here. A question really is philosophy. That's what philosophy is. It's a question upon question after question. I don't want to get into that now. But that he progressed from that question until he displaced her devotion to the simple word of God. Thou shalt not eat of it. And he notice now he displaced her from her fellowship with God, her place with her husband. The home was was uh the home was uh uh the headship was displaced and the home was dismembered &gt;&gt; because now Eve had a different head. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Brother Brandon uses the phrase all the time, just one word, just one word." Well, the word and God himself are synonymous. &gt;&gt; Do you have an agreement on that? The word and God himself is synonymous. So now if we have, you know, the prophet can say, well, he he got her to disbelieve just one word. Well, actually, we can put it in this terminology without changing it at all. It's absolutely in harmony with the scripture. What Satan did through the serpent was he got her to move away from the person &gt;&gt; of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I told you how affected I was when I I found brother Brandham using in the last service of leadership he uses the phrase the person of eternal life. Now I have here I want you to think about this. You can do a little bit of mathematics. 1636 times brother Brandham uses the phrase eternal life in his entire ministry that we have recorded. 1,636 times he uses that phrase eternal life. And that can be in scripture reading. It can be in any in in any form. But he uses that phrase that many times. There is over,00 perhaps, 1125. I just divided it by,25 and that comes out to about 1.4 times per message. One and a half times per message. A little bit less than one and a half times. So then I just began to scan down the various messages because I already had been impressed I believe of the Holy Spirit on this on this message of leadership because it was the last message. And you know there's something to be said when you have the last piece of instruction. Now before you go or before I leave, I want to say this to you. I would think that that should be very significant. &gt;&gt; And I found some places one one here, then two times in that message, sometimes three here, then one over here. When I got to leadership, 32 times in one service, he speaks of leadership and he speaks of eternal life. 32 times. I I said I said to my wife, I want to ask you something. Brother Brandham used this term one time, one time, two times, one time, two times, three times, one time. And then suddenly at the very last time, he's leaving the scene and he even says in there, "This may be my last message." And 32 times he speaks to a group of people, Christian businessmen, been saved, saved 10 years, 30 years, 40 years, saw early Pentecost, perhaps hundreds of them did. And he speaks to them, you must not reject eternal life. &gt;&gt; This young man rejected eternal life. This young man was offered eternal life and he keeps going through it. Is it significant? A profoundly significant. And I'll just interject for you. Here's some of the statements. But when he was confronted with the thought of eternal life, that's when he turned it down. The rich young ruler, he said, "I want you to notice with all this character that he had, yet he knew that he did not possess eternal life. He had all his character, but he did not possess eternal life." He said, "We each one are confronted with eternal life. We're not seeking to confront you with a church program this morning. We're not seeking to confront you with a certain style of of worship or a certain style of belief. I would pray that before every person this morning hearing my voice and in this sanctuary or throughout this building that we'd realize that the the word is synonymous with eternal life. It's not this life but it's eternal life. And he's talking about leadership. &gt;&gt; 32 times it it is in direct reference to eternal life. I thought of my own life. You perhaps I don't know exactly how you are right now but I said now I have a life. I have a life. I was speaking to my wife. I said I have a life in my body and it may suddenly just turn on me. I feel excellent but in a few moments I may not be well. That life is going to dictate to me what I do. that life is going to tell me I got to lay down. &gt;&gt; I've got to rest. Or that life is going to tell me, it's going to dictate. Or I might feel exuberant. I might feel energy, full of energy. I'm going to do this today. Or that life may dictate to me uh uh what my activity is going to be because the life it dictates. &gt;&gt; It has a role of leadership in your life. &gt;&gt; Now we have eternal life. And eternal life, you might as well say, is synonymous. Eternal life is Christ. &gt;&gt; Eternal life is the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And by having eternal life, that's the only way that we can actually worship God in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; He says, "When you come forth in the bedding ground of the mother," these are all just selected phrases. Then you become a human being and we are made in the image of your father. Now you can fellowship with him. You can fellowship with him. And the same thing by God. If you got eternal life, &gt;&gt; if you got eternal life, you came from the bedding grounds where God planted that seed and you got you came as a gene of your heavenly father. He says then the same thing that this boy was confronted with. He said, "I've observed these commandments. I've been taught since I was a youth." And Jesus loved him for it. &gt;&gt; So even if Christ loved him, it was still not sufficient. Even though he kept legally the word and he was taught from his childhood, he had been brought up and he followed it. But you see, it wasn't eternal life yet. It was just a creed. It was just something that he had learned to do. &gt;&gt; You know, young people, I was thinking of you last night because this was on my message. It takes more I'm speaking to you now. It takes more than your parents telling you how to live. &gt;&gt; It takes more than them telling this is wrong, honey, and this is right, and this is the way you should do it, and this is what you should not do, and I don't want you to do this, and I don't want you to do that, and I want you to do this. It takes more than that. It takes the person of the word to come in. You need to have a relationship with that person so that you know that now he is the one who's abiding in you. He's the one. Now you have a life in you dictating. &gt;&gt; And will it dictate? Absolutely. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll get right to a place maybe just going to go in there or you might be with some friends, some peers, some of your schoolmates and you and and and suddenly you'll find that there's inside a witness. I can't go any further. That is the person of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Eternal life is not some cute phrase. Eternal life is a person. Eternal life has a voice. Eternal life has a desire. Eternal life has a purpose. Eternal life has a will because it's a person. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that person of eternal life will direct and dictate &gt;&gt; what you should do, what you shouldn't do, how far you can go, how far you can't go. And then &gt;&gt; then you are worshiping. &gt;&gt; You may not even raise your hand. You may not clap. You may not be and demonstrative and use some exuberance. But there will be a true worship. &gt;&gt; And I would say that you cannot have that kind of a relationship. But what there is some emotional response &gt;&gt; of reverence &gt;&gt; to him. He said Jesus loved him but he refused to be guided. He refused to accept the real leadership of Jesus Christ to give him eternal life. He said the other leaders that he had in his youthful days had such an influence on him. the other leaders, the other people, others, &gt;&gt; the people that you work with or work for, &gt;&gt; the other young people that you associate with, your neighbors, the people that you have as friends, but are they going to stand and give an account for your life? No, &gt;&gt; you're going to give account for your own life &gt;&gt; and God's going to ask you, "What did you do with that message that I had spoken?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Regarding myself, &gt;&gt; my own person, eternal life, &gt;&gt; what did you do with that? He had other leaders and they affected him. I see the young people get together and they're so influenced from one another. I should say to you, stop that. Yes, &gt;&gt; you should stop that. Become an individual with your walk with God. &gt;&gt; You can have your friends and you can have a nice time. And we as a uh you know adults on down the road, but we have to have we have to have lines of demarcation that we can go thus far no further. &gt;&gt; Even with believers sometime I get with believers and then they start veering off into a conversation. It gets into an atmosphere. it gets into a it gets into a tenor. It gets into a kind of a a a a certain kind of a you know an angle and direction and things are being said and I don't have any more fellowship with it. I can't fellowship with that any longer and so I just withdraw within myself &gt;&gt; and fall silent because there's some things you can't participate in. &gt;&gt; Some conversation you can't participate in. There's nothing wrong with saying, you know, brother, you know, sister, the word actually says this. And I think I'd prefer not to engage in that conversation. &gt;&gt; The word says, "Whatsoever things are lovely, &gt;&gt; whatsoever things are of a good report, whatsoever things are true, there are things that are true, but they're not a good report. And whatsoever what what whatsoever things are lovely and pure and good and honest and of a good report, think on these things. &gt;&gt; Our whole walk with God is based on our response to the word of God. He said his youthful days he was so influenced till he refused to accept God's provided way which was Jesus Christ the only one who holds eternal life. The only one that can give you he says the church can't give you eternal life. This church can't give you eternal life. No church can give you eternal life. But the person of Jesus Christ, he is eternal life. And Jesus Christ is not who the world says he is. &gt;&gt; Uh Jesus Christ is not who the church system says he is. In fact, as I would like to say today, this is Christmas and I don't have a Christmas uh message as such and yet it's a very Christmas message because it's all about Christ who we are re remembering and recalling that he came even though he did not come at this time of the year. But I'd like to announce to you and all who will hear me. &gt;&gt; Satan has succeeded in giving this generation multitudes of false gods. &gt;&gt; And multitudes of false Jesuses. &gt;&gt; They have a concept of Jesus which cannot be found in the word of God. And with that concept in their mind, they're going to go to church. They're going to sing. They're going to raise their hand. They're going to cry. They're going to dedicate their lives and all the rest of it, but there will be no fellowship with God &gt;&gt; because God can only fellowship on the basis of his word. You come this way and I can hear you. &gt;&gt; The church can't give you eternal life. Not your neighbor, &gt;&gt; not your pastor, not your priest, not your creed, only Jesus Christ himself, &gt;&gt; can give you eternal life. The BM says every three years after a message has went forth sent from God, sent from God, they recognize this has been 20 years. It's talking about the message has been 20 years, no organization. &gt;&gt; It won't. &gt;&gt; That's a prophecy. You can do whatever you want to do. It won't. The message cannot be organized because the message is a person. &gt;&gt; It's Christ. &gt;&gt; The person. You can't organize him. Now it says the shuck has to pull away, &gt;&gt; which they did, and give the wheat a chance to lay before the sun to ripen on the message. to ripen on the message, coming right back into the church again, forming the body of Jesus Christ just like the first original one that went into the ground. Forming the body of Jesus Christ just like the original one &gt;&gt; that went into the ground. Now he said to see eternal life. Now he says you can see eternal life. In other words, this is what happened with the original wheat, Christ, and it's happening again. They pulled away from him there. They pulled away from him here. He spoke truth there. Spoke truth here. He confirmed his word there. He did the signs and the wonders there. Did it once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the shot pulled away &gt;&gt; and left the wheat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said it has to lay in the presence of the sun. Oh my. And he says, "Now to see eternal life." Now he says to refuse the person. I hope you're not getting too tired. Stay alert. &gt;&gt; Got a little distance. I'm going to go as quickly as I can. To refuse the person that's doing the calling, Christ. No matter if you're Pentecostal, Methodist, Luther, or whatever you are, nothing against them. Not at all. Nothing against them. Not at all. But in this age now, you've got to accept like they did in that age, the person of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is the word. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday, today and forever. Hebrews 13:8. You must accept the person of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Just a just a few more. And today he said don't say I'm Pentecost. I belong to this. I belong to that. I'm going to say don't say I belong to Bible way. &gt;&gt; It's fine for you to say I go to their church I belong to that group of people but not in reference to eternal life. &gt;&gt; Eternal life is a different subject. You come here because you have eternal life. You don't come here to get eternal life. You come here because you have it. And those are members of the body of Christ. We come to fellowship together because we're members of one body and that body is the body of Jesus Christ who has eternal life and we have eternal life by him. &gt;&gt; And so you grow a whole group of people, young married couples and all the rest of it that well it has been a tradition. We always go to church. This is where I was raised up. This is where my friends go or whatever we go here for whatever reason. You have to know why you come. &gt;&gt; We don't come because we're reared in the message as such. We don't come because we have a longstanding tradition of coming. We must come because we know the person of eternal life and we are fellowshipping together with other like members of like precious faith. &gt;&gt; These people were absolutely bewildered. You listen to the tape, it's totally silent. They're bewildered that this man of God that many of them regarded as a prophet is preaching this kind of message to them. They're absolutely dumbfounded. &gt;&gt; We've been born again for so many years. We've been full of the Holy Ghost. We've had evidences of speaking in tongues. We've been so anointed of God. He's not denying that. But he's telling them that the fullness of him who is the fullness of Godhead bodily Christ is present in his word and they're turning it down. &gt;&gt; And surprising what little things they turned it down on. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the big things, but it was the little things he was trying to get them to acknowledge and accept the little things. Just little things. How we treat one another, how we speak, how we within our families relate, have relationship. Everything that the word of God gives us counsel in is not given. It's not given to us folks so that we can say well that's nice. It's not what God is saying to you. This is the basic of worship. This is the basis upon which you approach me. &gt;&gt; This is the basis. One thing that we all have this morning, we have it as an individual unit. Now, I'm getting on perhaps dangerous ground now, but just hold your peace. We all have a mind. We have our own individual mind. We have some gray matter and we receive things and we digest it. We can adjust it quickly. We can do different things with it. We can manipulate it. We can make decisions based on it. We can allow it to affect us or allow it or decide that no, it's not going to affect us. Or we can say that is that's marvelous. And we say, well, I don't know what he's getting at. Our own individual mind will take handle. And with some maybe the mind has become closed off. With some maybe we become completely distracted with something else that's taking place. But others they might be riveted. This is incredible. Brother Bram's talking to us about idolatry. Talking to us about having no other gods. It's not strange, friends. That's what God preached to his people &gt;&gt; and that's what the others and you know what I have so much to say. But I'm going to tell you that your mind can quickly take and adjust things and and and let me just say per chance that what I'm saying is absolute truth. Per chance is absolute truth. And then through the mind you can take and adjust things and work it off. You can you know have a gravitational pull elsewhere and you come up with a different conclusion and you lift it up and say well I haven't really read the message. I don't really know what though those quotes I don't much about. I haven't I haven't heard a tape for months or years or whatever more. I haven't had much, you know, I I really don't know about it, but you know, I I do have another idea and I get and and and Satan will encourage, he will anoint that and just anoint that reasoning &gt;&gt; and it'll go over off here &gt;&gt; and you'll look at it, you say, I think that looks good. That's really what I I think I'll stand with that. You now have another God. You now have another God. &gt;&gt; And that's why if the church can persuade you that something is right outside of the word of God, &gt;&gt; you'll have, you know, I was reading something about idolatry. This is going to shock you. I read a website yesterday and it has under the title of idolatry and idolatry is legalism and the legalism in that whole website the whole website was devoted over you are a legalist if you will not accept homosexuals lesbians and same-sex marriage. I wrote him an email. &gt;&gt; I told him, "This is a despicable, disgraceful, and you have no place to make reference to the word of God." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not a minister, and it's not some legalist who have identified homosexuality. It is God who said it. And you can read it for yourself in the scriptures. And you have no right to call yourself a minister, call themselves a minister, &gt;&gt; a doctor, if you would. not a doctor of divinity. As far as I'm concerned, it's a do doctrine of devils. &gt;&gt; But that's what's being promoted to the people. And multitudes of people are being swayed away from the word of God and clearly a clear-cut answer out of the word of God. And now what do they have? They have an idolatry. Sir, &gt;&gt; God after he brought it out from Eden, what took place with Eve, then Abraham, he, the prophet said, and I referred to it, his daddy was an idol worshipper. That's how he was raised. And he knew that that needed to be connected with a covenant. And so soon as he comes out, God let him out. Come away from your kindred. And so when he comes out, God speaks to him, says, "I'm going to give you this land and to your seed." And right away he builds an altar because he knows that an altar and worship is associated with a covenant. It's based upon a promise, a word. And that's how communion takes place. And that's really what worship's all about. See, when you stand here, you raise your hands and you worship and you praise God or you sing or whatever you do or you give him thanks, whatever that needs to have a basis. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Needs to have a foundation. And the foundation must be I do this based upon the word of God. And furthermore, that you know something about the word of God. It's not based on I feel good. I feel excited. The preacher said something nice. Oh, isn't that fun? And we may have it associated with, you know, something that's humorous and oh, oh, that's not what it's based on. It's based on truth. It's based on the word of God. And when you have it based on the word of God, then you can have communion. And communion uh flows right into fellowship &gt;&gt; and into worship right after Abraham. Then God, are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Then God speaks to Isaac and this is the first time he didn't say, "I'm the God of Noah. I'm the God of Adam or I'm the God of Enoch." But now he comes and says to Isaac the son, "I'm the God of your father Abraham." &gt;&gt; In other words, I am who your father worshiped. I am the object of his focus, his attention. I am the one who had communion with your father. your father and I fellowship together. I am his God and I'm going to renew this promise to you." And then we go on to Jacob and come to Moses at the burning bush. And now he's astounded at this burning bush and he's attracted to it and a voice speaks. I am God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. and I'm sending you to deliver these people. He identifies himself as the God of these people. Now, I bring you quickly to where we started this morning. Just bear with me, please, for a little bit. Quickly, and they come they come out with this mighty hand, come into the wilderness and are are suddenly faced with the covenant of God from Mount Si. And what God was doing from Mount Si, friends, if you hear me now, what he was doing from Mount Si, he was joining himself, making the people a covenant people. Now they are a covenant people. You're not just a people that's come out under miracles and signs and wonders and plagues, but now I'm binding you to myself by a covenant. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he he starts that covenant with thou shalt not have any other gods before me. &gt;&gt; And you'll not make any graven image of anything of likeness in heaven and earth and all the rest of it and under the sea and so on. And immediately and make a calf. Now that calf was a plague to those people and that thing God warned them when you come into the land of the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Gurgosites and all the others, you shall not fall down before their gods. You shall not worship their gods. That was his instruction. But as they got on, the children of Israel, you know, you remember the brass serpent, the brass serpent when they when they complained and murmured and the little snakes came out and bit them and they died by the thousands and they cried out of Moses and Moses made the brass serpent which the medical staff still the medical world still uses a college of physicians and surgeons. That's their emblem. the snake on the cross on the pole and they said that you have to just look at that and you'll live ordained by God designed by his prophet and put there for the people to look at. And later on they took that they took that brass serpent and or one like it whatever but they made an idol out of it and one of their prophets had to destroy the thing. Destroy it because it he said they made an idol out of something that had been good. And we also find that Jerobom you know now they came to another place uh and Jerobom was not once again leadership he was not called to be the leader it's Riabom that was the son of Solomon but Jerobom was of a servant but he took over 10 of the kingdoms but he was afraid that if the people went down to Jerusalem to worship as they're supposed to do, their hearts would be joined to Riaboam. And so we must we must uh be diplomatic in this thing. So I'll we'll make a golden calf for Bethl and we'll make one down in Dan so that it will be geographically located so the people won't be displaced. We'll make it much easier for them to come to church and worship. the mothers with the babies won't have to travel so far and all of this in this business of going down to Jerusalem's old-fashioned anymore and we don't have to do we've got a more modern way we've got a more easy way and we'll make it more less cumbersome on the people and that thing is called in the scriptures the sins of Gerobam and it happened to last it was steady for 263 years and this king raised up and the Bible says and he did evil in the sight of the Lord for he did not put away the sins of Jeroboam. And it was a strange thing. They would destroy the groves and destroy all kinds of other false uh types of worship. They'd get rid of a lot of it, but they never got rid of some. And it was always the sins of Jeroboam that were always there. And you know in the message today, one of the things that has played the message is the idolatrous gods that people have packed in from their other denominations. &gt;&gt; Well, this is and I find out something else. I'm going to unload. Good. &gt;&gt; I have found I have found amongst believers at large, you understand this will go beyond this church, but I have found you know people get shocked and surprised. They see maybe a certain man or a woman or an individual or whatever more and they so fervently served God in the realm of the message for so many years, years and years, 10 years, 15 years, even more. And then just like a bolt of lightning out of somewhere and they're gone. Absolutely gone. It was like there was no foundation, there was no roots, there was no nothing. And they don't only turn away or turn aside from become an enemy of the message. And I know it troubles people because they say, "Well, we washed feet together. We had communion together. Were they ever born again?" Well, that's not for me to say. If they were born again, they're going to come back. &gt;&gt; They're going to repent. But if they don't, then they never were born again. &gt;&gt; Well, then on what basis? I mean, I even marveled at the peace they had. I marveled how they rejoiced. I marveled. I remember time and tears streamed down the face and and the hands were raised. I remember that there was such an expression of David in front of the ark. &gt;&gt; Right. Cain at his altar. &gt;&gt; But I went to Glor. By the way, I I went to this church or that church. I was right amongst the believers and and that's when all of this took place. That's when all of this happened. I'll tell you what happens in the message. There are elements within the message. There are ingredients, components within the message that men and women and families actually believed in previous years. Maybe maybe the church they were serving in didn't uphold that, but they held it in their heart. Example, and I' I've been very very cautious about this. I've I've talked to men men now just coming into the message and the thing they got off on they got off on a theme in the message they saw it how brother Brand talked about the women and how they ought to be in subjection and that see that thing was in them all the time just they they ought to be down I've always believed that that wife ought to serve and she ought to be at home that's the right place for her and for a bunch of it I can say amen amen amen but why is he saying it &gt;&gt; why is He's saying it. And you know what? I've never heard I've never heard any church preach this. I'm glad that somebody has got the gumption to stand up and put those women where they belong. And oh, they sit amongst the people and they rejoice and raise their hands and all the rest of it. They look like the most wonderful believers, but at some point in time, zingo, they're gone. Because that's not what the message is all about. The message, the message although it has these ingredients, it isn't because it suddenly find you find an element in there that agrees with something you always believe. That's not what the message is. &gt;&gt; Come in. Oh, the oneness of the godhead. This this uh uh wicked trinitarian doctrine. I always knew it was false. Haha. Who can believe in three gods? Finally, we find somebody that's got enough stamina and then enough uh enough spiritual fortitude to stand up and preach the truth against this trinity doctrine. Just watch that person. One day on down the road, they're going to go zingle because that's not what the message is all about. &gt;&gt; The message didn't come to find some spot in you that you agree with. &gt;&gt; That's right. The message is the person of Jesus Christ. He's Lord of all. Whether you agree with him or don't agree with him, he's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's right. &gt;&gt; He's king. The word's king. &gt;&gt; Not whether we agree with it, not whether it rubs us the right way or the wrong way. The word is right. And the fullness of the word has come in this day. And that is why we're also susceptible. We're susceptible until it comes. We're not susceptible to uh Satan taking a hold of our our reasoning and then we start we start vacasillating or we start gyrating. The Bible speaks of uh how Satan is a creature of beauty. And brother Brandham, I haven't got enough time today or this week. He said that the goddess of America will be the beauty of women. She will be a goddess. That's not because of what you see. Say, "Well, I see that on the street." Has nothing to do whether you see it or don't see it. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; But I can see where Satan has come with just every possible enchanting possibility to augment that beauty to cause not man but a whole nation to be corrupted. And so he's provided every possible means, can change your physical features, can enhance your body, can add the necessary color, can add whatever whatever. Brother Brandham was asked about can a woman color her hair and all kinds. He says I haven't got a scripture for it. The thing is it is what does a person do it for? &gt;&gt; What is the objective? &gt;&gt; Why do we wear what we wear? &gt;&gt; Why? So we we we see that the the word itself is may be very very clear. I think that if uh now a woman brother I'm not talking about you sisters but when I speak to a congregation like this there are sisters who are sisters indeed. There are others perhaps who have not come to know this God of this word. I'm talking about this person &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. It has nothing to do with who you're sitting with this morning and oh you know this is the area my friends these are this is where I come to church. Has nothing to do with that. Has nothing to do with Bible way. I'm talking about the person of Jesus Christ. And so actually the message has very very clearcut very clearcut statements concerning our life, concerning our conduct. And and because he talked a great deal about the women and listen not in a derogatory way said your body was created and given you by God to bring forth life. And the graces which you have been given to feed a child, to bear a child, are not to be thrown to the world before the eyes of lustful men. Now if you in honor before God in honor of God conduct yourself in such a way so that before God you're doing what the word has said you're free. But on the other hand, if you go and prim and fancify yourself and fix yourself all up in a certain way that you know in your heart of hearts that this is going to attract men of the world and I see that they devise ways to show and accentuate that parts of a woman's body and expose it. You're quiet, but that's all right. &gt;&gt; And garments that will show they're underneath garments. Now, I'm sure if you had if you had the prophet of God standing here and you had a a question on that, you wouldn't even have the nerve to ask it. Do you know why? Because down in your heart, you already have a witness that that's wrong. And young men, the spirit that's in the world today is a spirit of perversion &gt;&gt; to turn to index the thing around so that a man will lessen his place in the home. He doesn't take the responsibility. He becomes uh weak. He becomes wimpish, if I can put it that way. He he he he he becomes uh uh so that he hasn't got that manly &gt;&gt; stamina, &gt;&gt; that manly way about him. That's right. &gt;&gt; And and and I I want to say when that spirit comes, that thing needs to be rejected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Immediately. &gt;&gt; And you don't fool around with that thing because we already have a clear word of God &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, you know, this is the way it is." and that's the way it is and whatever more. I talked to a young man in fact is I'll give you a testimony. I was standing in a fellowship hall of a church in this message in another city and there was just all kinds of I was a stranger. I knew some of the people, but they're just walking back and forth and I I was just standing there and a fine handsome young man, he just sailed past a whole group of people just sail past and the Holy Spirit spoke to me said he's a homosexual. So then I watched for him and there was a series of meetings taking place and after a given service I waited for a long time. It wasn't even in that series of meetings. I waited for a long time and the service was finished and God had spoke very very specific. I don't even know who preached, but that young man was left sitting in the pew. And I slipped in beside him and I put my arm around his shoulder and I said, "I first saw you in another city. I didn't even know who you were." I said, "As you walked by," I said, "God spoke to me and said, "You're a homosexual." His head went down between his legs. He cried out, "I hate it. I hate it. I hate it." I said, "I'll pray for you." He said, "What do I do?" I said, "Well, you can there are certain things you can do. One is I'd stop wearing this strong perfume." &gt;&gt; All right, &gt;&gt; that you can do. Stop wearing this. I don't mind you wear aftershore. It was a different purpose for him. You wear what you want. I don't have a scripture for it, but I was telling him what he need to do. Uh, what do you read for reading material? You can get rid of that. If you do what you will do and can do, God will deliver you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that spirit's prevalent. And I say to the men, not only young men, but to the men of this congregation and all that hear me, that's a damnable spirit that's in the world. &gt;&gt; And it comes in a lot of different ways. It's not only a a a a sexual thing, but it makes men so they don't take their place, don't take their spiritual place in the home. And we need men that take a spiritual headship before God and that can say follow me &gt;&gt; as I follow Christ. &gt;&gt; And I say to the wives, if your husband isn't following Christ, this word, the person of Jesus Christ, you may have to make your own way. &gt;&gt; And perhaps a lot of husbands here won't understand that. Husbands get they get uh uh they get very insecure and they tell their wives, "Don't you dare speak to the pastor." I say to that man or that husband, you make sure then she doesn't need to speak to me. &gt;&gt; I don't want her to speak to me. I don't I don't have the time to speak to an unnecessary thing. When you hear clearly what the word of God is, then I say, "Do it in the name of Jesus Christ. Do it." and the rest it won't be necessary. Live the standard &gt;&gt; before the church, before your family, before God, before the brothers. Can the church say amen to this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to close. I've been far too long and I've been about four or five services on this and I'm not I'm not even halfway here. But when when you have the least twinge, I don't care what it's concerning in regards to those things which have been reinstituted and have been established, confirmed and reconfirmed by a vindicated prophet and and and I will say this if he's coming to his last message and God is wanting to emphasize not 10fold, not 20fold, but over 30fold all &gt;&gt; times. He wants to stress this is eternal life. &gt;&gt; This isn't what somebody thought. This isn't just, you know, and the men there were thinking, "Well, that's just Brother Brandon. He's got a wonderful gift." They had an idol. &gt;&gt; A mental idol &gt;&gt; that had been constructed on what they thought he was. In fact, instead of what God made him out to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might have some question about that, but I want you to think very very deeply. And if a person realizes, you know, it isn't kind of what you think, what I think, what they think, what it's what the person of Jesus Christ has declared, &gt;&gt; what the person has said. And if you follow him, this isn't this isn't friends something that's going to have us in good standing per time, but this is for eternity. We're talking about eternal life. Eternal life. I'm speaking to you this morning for eternal life. This man failed to follow eternal life. And incidentally, maybe you I know you've read the scripture. Listen as I close. Brother Brandham tra t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t this young man because Jesus tells several different parables and brother Brandham links them all together. He takes the young man that came running, the one we talk about most, falling down. What must I do to have eternal life? &gt;&gt; God tells him what to do. All these have I done for my youth. If you be perfect, then sell all that you have, give it to the poor, and come and follow me. and he couldn't accept that. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus then brother Brandham ties him and takes him and said, "Let's follow this young man." &gt;&gt; And he takes him to the next place where he's had such prosperity now because his father has led him into being such a successful businessman. He has had such pro prosperity. He's so recognized and he has a great feast and he has prosperity until he says, "What shall I do with all of this I've been so blessed with? I know what I'll do. I'll tear down my barns and I'll build greater." And little did he realize there'd be a God who say, "This night your soul will be required of you." And he also was the same one that had his great feast and walked out and Lazarus was laying at his gate. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham ties them all together. Said the same young man &gt;&gt; as he moved through life &gt;&gt; and now he's been so successful and there's a beggar outside and he comes and he and he and he he just gives him you know the pittance &gt;&gt; and now this night le be required. And now he prays and cries out, cries out, "Let Lazarus come. &gt;&gt; Let him come." And just with a drop of water on my tongue cuz he he says, "I'm in torment &gt;&gt; in that place." My brother, my sister, that is why why did that even be written in the scripture so that we could avoid that kind of a place? We could avoid that kind of a man. And that is why the gospel is preached to us so straight, so forward. But this gospel is none other than the person of Jesus Christ. And that person is eternal life. And there is no life outside of him. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; I don't want this church to become a social place. You're free to come. It's a public place if I'm being honest with you. Sometimes people come because they something in their life has happened or something in their family or they get emotionally enthused about it says, "Well, I want to go, you know, I'm going to start. I'm going to start going to church. I'm going to be there. I'm happy they're here, but that's not the reason. &gt;&gt; The very thing that brought them here is the very thing will take them out. &gt;&gt; You understand? You understand? It's not it isn't doing anything. And if a person would be here in that state today, be it man, woman, child, whoever you are, you you need to say, why am I here? &gt;&gt; Why have I come? &gt;&gt; Why am I Why am I declaring this is my church home? And you want to be able to answer yourself and say, "I have a relationship." And that relationship with the person of eternal life is so real and so solid. It doesn't matter what happens to my friend, my family, my mother, my father, my children, my wife, my husband. I have a commitment to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And it goes beyond all of this. I have a relationship with the person of Christ. And he is the word. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, how we're so dependent upon you. How man's words will fail. My words will fail. Your words shall never fail. And oh God, we have been confronted this this generation, these people. And I say of my own self, we have been confronted with the person of eternal life. And Lord, I want to testify. I want to say again, I want to confirm. I accept it. I receive you. I receive the word. And I pray that you'll show any area, Lord, where we find it difficult. and and and in following you, you have said to us, "Come and follow me. I'll make you fishers of men. You've called us like you've called a young man to come and follow you." May we not find anything, oh God, that would deter us, that would uh hinder us, that would stumble us or be an obstacle in our way, make us victorious. I pray over it, oh God. And I ask that you'll give us, Lord, you'll give us such a sensitive such a sensitivity to your word. Lord, may our may our mind be so conscious of your presence, what it is that you're seeking to do in our lives and in the congregation and in the body of Christ at large. Father, I ask you bless this people. How I thank you for them. How privileged I feel I am and that of my wife and family, oh God, that we can be here in fellowship and be in the land of the living and lift up our voices to you and give you praise. I thank you for their lives. I thank you for their testimony. I thank you for the great things that you have done on their behalf. But Lord, I pray that you will and we will continue to move move us, oh God, in a direction where your supernatural hand will be visible amongst us. And I pray, oh God, we will be a mighty witness for truth. &gt;&gt; Don't let us diminish. &gt;&gt; Don't let us, oh God, dilute &gt;&gt; the the strength of the word of God. I pray that people here will speak it. Let them be anointed to speak it. Let them be anointed above that to live it. I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. And every hungry soul that is calling out to you now, I ask that you'll meet them for your glory. Jesus, we ask. Amen. Amen. on Tuesday. Uh I have to leave for Ghana and uh I just got the yesterday I believe it was uh I received the schedule of the meetings and I we might be able to lessen it a wee bit. I don't know. Uh there's a brother from New York that is also going and he's taking some of the services. I I don't know the brother. I haven't met him, but I did speak to him on the phone. Brother Tony's been to his church and speaks very highly of him. And uh there's going to be services are starting on Thursday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Uh there's two services a day. And then uh on Sunday night they have arranged a radio broadcast and uh they want want me to be interviewed on national radio regarding the life and ministry of brother Branham and uh brother Tay apparently has arranged all of this and then then they have a radio broadcast. So the schedule is is really very heavy. So, I'm asking that you will pray and if you'll just hold me up in prayer that you know for each of these situations and each of these occasions that God will just give me wisdom and it's just almost like a U-turn. We just come back. We're back here for watch night service and uh and I'm sure that you will pray for me. I know that you will do that. Uh let's stand, shall we? Let's start again with that chorus. Linda, you're playing and I place you in the highest place. I place you in the highest place [Music] for you. I reach. We praise you. I [Music] all and we come to you worship as you give the highest place you for you. What great I am all [Music] and we come to you worship as we're going to say this maybe once or twice more. I would like you to within the deep depths of your heart and soul and mind. If you've had thoughts, maybe they're thoughts of condemnation. Maybe they're things that have attracted you or drawn you. Maybe you've whatever and Satan has tried to use them against you. I say lay them down. &gt;&gt; Lay them down right now. If there be any question in your mind concerning the word of God, lay it down if you would just now and place him in the highest place. Don't have your own mind, your own thoughts. Friends, we don't have any we just don't have any thought that can is justifiable in the presence of God. I say it's his word and his word alone. His thought, he's not a God that doesn't speak. He's not some idol of wood or stone. He has spoken. &gt;&gt; He's revealed the secrets of their hearts. &gt;&gt; It's not a man who did that. It was God, the person of eternal life. He's the one that's delivered this word. &gt;&gt; The angel that has gone before us. &gt;&gt; We're not here where we are today because some man led us here. We're here because the angel of the Lord has gone before us and has brought us to this place and we respect him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The person of Jesus Christ. Oh, how we love him. Be adored. Be adored. Oh God, be exalted throughout this day. We place you in the highest place. &gt;&gt; We place you in the highest place for you. I pray I praise you. I love [Music] all and we come to you to worship [Applause] [Music] our gracious and loving Lord Jesus Christ. The world is remembering a babe that was born, but we are remembering one who has come with a sign of a cloud and a voice. We're remembering one who has come and demonstrated himself with all wisdom, even revealing the depths and the secrets of the hearts of this entire generation. Oh God, we are giving honor and glory to that one, the angel of the Lord, none other than God himself. Oh, how we thank you. We have a genuine uh the only true and living God, Elohim, Jehovah, amongst us. Oh God, we give you praise. I ask that you will come in all of your magnificence to the individual life regardless of how young or youthful they might be or how old or elderly they might be. Come to them in whatever situation in life. Lord, I in the name of Jesus Christ come against the devil that has raised up such uh sometimes calamities, sometimes difficulties, reversals they've done. He's done all kinds of evil things to distract the people to get their minds off of the focal point, off of the important thing. I reject him, oh God. I deny him, Father, and I call on the forces of heaven, the angels of God, and the power of the Holy Spirit to move throughout this congregation and throughout the land, Lord, wherever the voice is. And may the people be set free, oh God, of these burdensome things, these cumbersome things, these things that have weighed them down and caused them to be weary, Lord, from whatever department or whatever area Satan has tried to creep in. I pray that you'll bring a stop to him, Lord. Bring a halt to him. And at this time of revalry when the world is going into their parties and their drinking and terrible life of disgrace to the nation, I pray, oh God, there'll be a holy nation. &gt;&gt; A group of people rise up that'll say, "Holiness unto the Lord, holiness unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; A people, Lord, that you'll look down upon and be blessed with their praises and their worship. and we worship you in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus Christ, dismiss us from this place, Lord, for some refreshment, oh God, and anoint your servant, I pray tonight, Lord, as we feed, we feed. This is the Lord's day &gt;&gt; and we give it entirely to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Hallelujah. I say to you, this day is a full day. This service has been a long service. But I've also been very conscious. This is the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; And we may get away say, well, we don't believe in the Sabbath anymore. We don't believe in that. That is true. Our Sabbath is Jesus Christ. But I still believe it's important to give him a day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This isn't a shopping day. This isn't a Walmart day. This isn't a Hudson's Bay or some other day. This is the Lord's day. Hallelujah. We want to honor him. Set it aside. So, I've been in church 4 hours today. Whoa. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good thing you're not in brother docus church. It wouldn't even be through the song service yet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us not be a bunch of weak knees. American, Canadian, Western, whatever, whatever. Let us be solid, rugged Christians, for God. Hallelujah. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Shake hands with one another and tell them you're happy you're a Christian. You're dismissed. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
