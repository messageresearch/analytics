[4:26] The unseen hand.
[4:29] God bless you this morning.
[4:32] There is another
[4:38] seed hand to me
[4:43] that Jesus way.
[4:49] I cannot see
[4:54] how going through
[5:00] this world of
[5:05] this and still leads
[5:10] me as I go.
[5:15] I'm trusting you to
[5:21] be the unseen.
[5:28] We thank you for your guiding us, Lord,
[5:31] this we
[5:42] reach that strength.
[5:46] I'm still guiding
[5:52] the unseen
[5:54] hand.
[5:57] This man has led
[6:02] through shadows
[6:04] free.
[6:07] And while it
[6:12] I have no fear,
[6:17] I know will lead
[6:22] me to that.
[6:28] sin or sorrow
[6:33] there can come.
[6:37] I'm trusting to
[6:42] the unseen
[6:45] hand
[6:47] that guides me through
[6:52] this wey land
[6:57] and some sweet
[7:04] Strength
[7:07] still guided by
[7:12] the unseen
[7:14] hand.
[7:17] Yes, I long to see
[7:22] myior.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Is that the longing of your heart?
[7:27] And sing the story.
[7:32] Sing by grace
[7:37] and
[7:42] that is great.
[7:46] I'll praise him for
[7:51] his guiding
[7:54] hand.
[7:56] We're trusting you
[8:06] that guest
[8:25] still guided
[8:27] by
[8:30] the unseen
[8:32] man. I'm trusting to I'm trusting to
[8:40] the unseen
[8:42] man
[8:45] that God.
[8:47] Are you thankful for his leadership?
[8:52] Hallelujah.
[8:54] And some sweet day
[8:59] I'll reach that strength
[9:04] still
[9:09] the unseen
[9:11] hand.
[9:14] Hallelujah.
[9:16] We depend upon that unseen hand don't we
[9:19] friends? Certainly appreciated the
[9:21] service Wednesday night. Brother John
[9:23] speaking on the eagles setting their
[9:26] wings. We're born to fly.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; We're not born to be earthbound. We're
[9:30] not born to be natural. Just live a life
[9:32] and then that's it. Job saw something
[9:35] more. And I believe that that's our
[9:37] revelation as well. I've asked brother
[9:39] Michael Ray to come and help us sing
[9:41] this morning. When believing becomes my
[9:44] victory. I appreciate brother Michael.
[9:48] God gives gifts in the body and I
[9:50] believe it's for all of us to enjoy. So
[9:52] you help him sing.
[9:55] I'm going to enjoy it. I told him if
[9:57] it's for one, sign me up. It's for me. I
[10:00] love this song. I love to hear the
[10:02] saints of God sing it. Amen.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; It's not hard to believe.
[10:12] Standing on the mountain tops of glory.
[10:19] Amen.
[10:22] Oh, when you can hear the songs of
[10:25] angels and the breeze from heaven send
[10:29] your spirit
[10:31] so re.
[10:36] Oh, but in the valley once more,
[10:41] will Jesus still be Lord? That's the
[10:46] question.
[10:49] Cuz
[10:52] believing in believing
[10:56] isn't easy.
[10:58] That is the testing.
[11:03] Well, I need
[11:08] for a time
[11:10] when the sun does not shine
[11:13] and the mountain top is just a memory.
[11:20] When there's no sign to be seen
[11:24] and I don't feel
[11:28] to the word of God
[11:34] and I
[11:39] tr my way and I just don't understand
[11:45] what it means.
[11:48] That's when nothing else will you do.
[11:53] It alone will see me through
[11:56] and believe it becomes my victory.
[12:05] Oh, it's not hard to believe
[12:11] things are going well. The skies are
[12:15] sunny.
[12:20] Oh, when you feel making progress,
[12:24] doing good
[12:27] in time.
[12:33] Oh my
[12:37] go
[12:40] keep the faith. That's the question.
[12:48] Oh, cuz believe when
[12:52] is easy.
[13:00] Oh,
[13:06] when the sun does not shine
[13:12] is just
[13:16] there's no sign to see
[13:20] and I don't
[13:24] do the word God
[13:30] and I pray for
[13:34] when troules come my way
[13:38] just
[13:40] understand what he
[13:44] well that's when nothing else will do
[13:48] the Lord will see me
[13:52] And while we stand
[13:56] for again
[14:17] to Heat. Heat.
[14:30] I
[14:32] for the day
[14:34] when the trouble come my way
[14:43] and that's when nothing else will do.
[14:48] May the Lord see through
[14:51] and believe
[14:53] becomes my victory.
[15:00] I
[15:07] sh
[15:13] Have you ever been there?
[15:21] Do your work.
[15:28] Hallelujah.
[15:31] for the day when when the troules come
[15:35] my way and
[15:38] understand.
[15:43] That's when nothing else will do.
[15:47] The Lord will see through
[15:51] and believe becomes my victory.
[15:59] Hallelujah.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:03] Thank you for the victory, oh God.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your word, Lord. Healer.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[19:13] I
[19:16] might.
[19:22] You are.
[19:30] Oh, let faith drop in your heart. this
[19:32] morning, saints.
[19:35] He is more than enough for us.
[19:38] Hallelujah.
[19:40] He's more than our daily bread. We need
[19:43] his word.
[19:45] Hallelujah.
[19:48] Jesus, you're just lifted up once more.
[19:52] Sing it out again.
[19:55] Hallelujah.
[19:58] I believe
[20:01] you're my healer.
[20:05] I believe
[20:07] you are all I need.
[20:13] I believe, Lord. I believe. I believe.
[20:20] You're my
[20:25] I
[20:29] for
[20:33] Jesus. You're all I need.
[20:42] Hallelujah.
[20:45] Why don't we just pray together this
[20:47] morning? Heavenly Father, your word has
[20:50] declared it and we believe it.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; As Jacob said, we have enough.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; You, oh God, are all that we need.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we stand behind your word this
[21:07] morning.
[21:08] Just reflecting on a little story that
[21:10] our prophet told us.
[21:13] There was a battlefield one day and
[21:15] everything was destroyed.
[21:18] But underneath the rock, a little flower
[21:20] was pushing up. Beneath all the debris,
[21:23] beneath all the confusion, all the
[21:26] death, a little flower was pushing up
[21:28] because it had been hidden behind the
[21:31] rock.
[21:32] Lord, may we find ourselves this morning
[21:35] hidden behind that rock of ages. Lord,
[21:38] if one has not found themselves there,
[21:40] may they fall upon that rock. Lord, may
[21:43] they cry out, "Oh God, save me as blind
[21:47] Barnameus cried out one day. Oh, son of
[21:51] David, have mercy upon me. Lord, we
[21:55] stand in a generation, Lord, that's cold
[21:58] and indifferent. They don't want to cry
[22:00] out to you, Lord." But we want to cry
[22:03] out and say, "Come quickly, Lord Jesus.
[22:07] Lord,
[22:08] &gt;&gt; be our portion today, Father.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; Be with the minister, Lord, as he comes.
[22:13] Take our pastor, Lord.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, use him this morning to speak to
[22:18] your people. Feed the sheep and feed the
[22:21] lambs.
[22:23] Take our brother Tom this morning, Lord.
[22:26] Even as he's prepared his heart for this
[22:28] service this evening in Seattle, your
[22:30] children are gathering, Lord, to feed
[22:32] upon the body word of the son of man.
[22:36] Lord, may each and everyone receive
[22:38] their portion. Oh God, that is good for
[22:41] today.
[22:43] Lord, if there's one that has need of
[22:45] healing in their body, may faith drop
[22:48] into their heart this morning. See you
[22:51] as that risen lamb that has come. It's
[22:54] been their propitiation. Lord, if
[22:56] there's one that is dead in sin and
[22:58] trespasses, would they look to Calvary
[23:01] this morning and see the blood, Lord,
[23:04] and claim that blood of Jesus Christ
[23:07] that was shed on their behalf. You sent
[23:10] your only son into the world
[23:13] to save the lost.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for redemption's
[23:18] price that has been paid.
[23:20] Oh God, we have received the atonement
[23:23] and we give you thanks this morning to
[23:26] be able to stand in the household of
[23:28] faith as your bride being robed in your
[23:31] righteousness.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; We accept it this morning.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; We believe it. There's nothing that we
[23:37] have done that would merit it. Father,
[23:40] &gt;&gt; but this morning we want to say thank
[23:42] you, Jesus.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. May your Holy Spirit so
[23:48] overshadow this congregation this
[23:50] morning that one would not be able to
[23:53] leave and say that they did not see you.
[23:56] May we be different this morning, Lord.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; Meet us in a special way, we pray. We'll
[24:03] be sure to give you all the thanks and
[24:05] all the glory and the honor.
[24:08] Hallelujah.
[24:10] Hallelujah.
[24:13] Hallelujah.
[24:15] Brother Jim Douly and family, we'd like
[24:18] to thank you all so much for your
[24:20] prayers.
[24:22] God has and thank God for his grace and
[24:25] healing power. Touching brother Jim, the
[24:27] family has asked that refrain from
[24:30] visiting for the next week or so as he
[24:32] is very weak and tired in his body needs
[24:35] to recover. So we trust that you'll
[24:38] honor that request from the family.
[24:41] Amen. He is at home resting. God bless
[24:45] you, Sister Patricia. Brother Ules.
[24:49] Amen. You may have your seats this
[24:52] morning.
[24:54] Sister Elena Hendrickson's got a special
[24:56] for us.
[24:58] It's a song that I believe that you
[24:59] wrote. It's called My Story. So, it's
[25:03] real nice. The verses are very good. So,
[25:07] listen to the words. Brother Roger
[25:09] Gerard, you here this morning? Is that
[25:11] Brother Roger? Why don't you stand up,
[25:12] Brother Roger, with your wife this
[25:15] morning, Sister Sandre, God bless you.
[25:17] Why don't we welcome them this morning
[25:18] from Tucson, Arizona. Good to have you
[25:21] here with us. I believe that's your
[25:24] daughter from up in se down in Seattle,
[25:26] actually. So, you're up visiting her and
[25:28] it's very nice to have you here the
[25:30] service this morning. There's any other
[25:32] visitors with us, we certainly want to
[25:34] say God bless you and welcome you to the
[25:36] service. those on the internet hook up
[25:38] say God bless you to you as well sister
[25:40] Elena.
[26:01] Satan picked up a pen
[26:06] and he wrote down what I used to leave.
[26:11] He placed all he could in a book.
[26:15] Displayed it for the world to see.
[26:20] But when I knelt at the cross and gave
[26:22] Jesus my life, I laid that book at his
[26:27] feet.
[26:29] He opened the cover, dipped in his
[26:33] blood, and wrote, "Redemption complete."
[26:38] But that's not the end of the story.
[26:43] God wrote a new chapter for me.
[26:47] Then he tore out the pages, stained and
[26:51] unclean, and wrote that I'm pardoned and
[26:55] free.
[26:57] The blood covered all of my sin and
[27:00] regret. All the past was fully erased.
[27:06] When God, the great author, reached down
[27:09] in his grace and took all those pages
[27:14] away.
[27:22] And now I'm walking with him.
[27:27] As he works his plan out in me,
[27:32] he gives me new mercy each morning
[27:36] and blessings abundantly.
[27:41] And sometimes when Satan still comes to
[27:44] remind me he once had power and sway,
[27:50] I simply remind him what happened back
[27:54] there and stand on the word. As I say,
[28:02] that's not the end of the story.
[28:06] God wrote a new chapter for me.
[28:10] And then he tore out those pages stained
[28:14] and unclean and wrote that I'm pardoned
[28:17] and free.
[28:20] The blood covered all of my sin and
[28:23] regret. All the past was fully erased.
[28:29] When God the great author reached down
[28:32] in his grace and took all those pages
[28:35] away.
[28:40] One day I'll close the book forever.
[28:44] When my work on earth is done,
[28:52] I'll stand in his presence forgiven and
[28:55] clean. When this race of life is run,
[29:03] he'll open the book up and see all the
[29:07] pages he wrote through all of my days.
[29:13] Then say, "Take your place. My spot is
[29:16] bright. Nothing stands in your way."
[29:24] But that's still not the end of the
[29:26] story.
[29:28] The last chapter only begins.
[29:33] For together in heaven, we'll talk of
[29:36] his grace and rejoice all over again.
[29:42] Give him all glory for all that he has
[29:46] done. And by his side I will praise
[29:51] and thank the redeemer for that wondrous
[29:55] day when he took all my old life away.
[29:59] I will thank the redeemer for that
[30:03] wondous day when he took all those pages
[30:07] away.
[30:24] Amen. Amen. Thank you for that special
[30:27] sister Lena. It's not the end of the
[30:29] story.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we sing together my hope
[30:32] is in the Lord as we get ready to change
[30:35] the order of the service. Ask our pastor
[30:37] to come this morning.
[30:39] Amen. It's good to have everybody here
[30:42] this morning.
[30:44] I stand in all within the presence of
[30:49] the Lord.
[30:53] Through the wisdom of the aes.
[31:02] The raing of the se
[31:09] the living
[31:14] source
[31:16] of life
[31:23] Heat.
[31:27] Heat.
[31:37] is
[31:41] forever more.
[31:48] His tender mercies come to every rising
[31:54] sun
[31:57] to be the sinner in his broken
[32:06] Yeah.
[32:12] Heat.
[32:22] Heat.
[32:24] Heat.
[32:34] Forever
[32:40] is the Lord
[32:44] forever more.
[32:48] Why we sing the first verse again?
[32:51] I stand in all
[32:54] the presence of Lord.
[32:59] Heat. Heat.
[33:09] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[33:19] Heat.
[33:26] Heat.
[33:36] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[33:46] Ever
[34:17] forever more.
[34:21] Let's blend our voices together.
[34:25] My hope
[34:28] is in the Lord.
[34:32] from this time on
[34:36] and ever more.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Forever.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; My hope
[34:56] is in the Lord.
[35:01] From this time on
[35:05] and ever more.
[35:09] Oh
[35:10] my hope
[35:14] is in the Lord
[35:18] forever.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:29] Good morning to everyone.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; It's a good day when we can come into
[35:34] the house of God
[35:36] &gt;&gt; and have the freedom and liberty.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. To worship the living God.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; I want to say before we go any further
[35:46] that we certainly appreciate all of
[35:49] those that are live streaming the
[35:51] service.
[35:53] We uh appreciate your uh the time that
[35:57] you take to some people have to get up
[36:00] in the middle of the night and but they
[36:02] want to be in that service and they can
[36:04] get it archived but they like to have it
[36:06] live streamed and be here in real time.
[36:09] So, however it works out and I do want
[36:12] to say that we appreciate so much the
[36:15] emails that you send and the
[36:17] encouragement sometime perhaps you may
[36:20] think that uh there's nobody on this
[36:22] end. We're here and I read them all and
[36:26] I answer most of them. I have a uh for
[36:30] those you haven't got an answer, it's
[36:31] coming.
[36:33] It'll just be a few days. We just have a
[36:36] a lot of things that are going on. And I
[36:38] also want to thank you for your
[36:40] offerings and your gifts. And it does
[36:42] there is costs associated with it. You
[36:44] have to have people involved and and
[36:47] there are some costs with it. And and so
[36:48] I'm glad for those of you that are
[36:50] conscious of that and you give it just
[36:52] is really appreciated on this end. And
[36:54] then others hear about mission projects
[36:57] and they send in offerings. They send in
[36:59] offerings. two of them I think at least
[37:02] uh brother Louise came from for
[37:04] Argentina and Chile came from the
[37:06] internet and we really appreciated that.
[37:09] God bless you in your giving. And uh
[37:13] also I wonder should we be saying
[37:15] something about the camp? It's rushing
[37:16] right up on us.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Why don't you say something about it
[37:20] then?
[37:23] Send the man who knows.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's excited about camp coming
[37:28] on? Amen.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; I've talked to brother Aaron McGiri,
[37:31] talked to brother Danny Stemann, and
[37:33] they are are both just under great
[37:36] anticipation and expectation to be a
[37:38] part of this camp this year. So, we put
[37:42] ourselves aside and I'm sure there's
[37:44] many ones that have have prayed. Uh I
[37:46] know the prayer meetings have have uh
[37:48] remembered the camp. You know, we've had
[37:51] some tremendous camps. This is our 25th
[37:54] year. And I I think it's a great
[37:57] privilege that I've uh been u a part of
[38:00] this this burden for our young people to
[38:03] see our children grow up in the presence
[38:04] of God and then to see young men and
[38:07] young ladies raise up and they're the
[38:08] they're our strength and they're our
[38:10] helpers at this camp. I want to thank
[38:12] you all all the counselors that have
[38:14] preparing themselves for their cabins. I
[38:17] want you to know young people, we do
[38:18] this because we love you. And as I said
[38:21] to the counselors last week, Brother Ed,
[38:23] I hope you just don't mind a moment. I
[38:25] took the scripture where Paul said to
[38:27] King Agria, I was not disobedient to the
[38:29] heavenly vision.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; And I believe our pastor had a vision 25
[38:35] years ago that this would not just be a
[38:37] young people's camp that this would be a
[38:40] family camp where our families, our
[38:42] daddies and our mommies could come
[38:44] together and have a special time in his
[38:45] presence. And I can say with Paul, I
[38:49] have not been disobedient to that
[38:51] vision. That we have put our efforts
[38:54] together to move this church forward to
[38:57] have a blessed time in his presence. And
[38:59] may God come down on this 25th
[39:01] anniversary and give us a special camp.
[39:04] Amen. That will be starting next week in
[39:07] August. Now, I've got my dates going
[39:09] around in my head. We start the 10th.
[39:11] August 10th on the Monday 8th. Sorry.
[39:16] August 8th, 8th, 9th, and 10th for the
[39:19] young people. And then we'll go into our
[39:22] senior camp. God bless you. Remember
[39:24] brother Danny Stemann and brother Aaron
[39:26] McGary. Thank you.
[39:31] See, we don't even make a very big thing
[39:33] at the 25th anniversary.
[39:36] You know why? Eternal beings. What's
[39:39] What's 25 years?
[39:41] It's not even a breath. Uh we're we're
[39:44] going right into eternity. We're not
[39:45] saying we're going to have eternal life.
[39:46] We have eternal life.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just enjoying it. Uh we're
[39:51] don't enjoying it as much as we can down
[39:53] here right now, but we're on our way to
[39:56] enjoy it a whole lot more and we're
[39:58] living for that day. Uh so you know it's
[40:02] wonderful to have people engaged in the
[40:04] camp and a good number of them that were
[40:06] that are working there now were actually
[40:08] dedicated on the platform
[40:11] dedicated as children on the platform.
[40:14] It's nice to see them you know at at
[40:16] full uh uh shall I say in the full
[40:19] responsibility. So we're we're really
[40:22] happy about that. Uh I also wanted to
[40:26] give a word of thanks and this is
[40:28] sincere. This isn't to fill in time for
[40:31] those that have uh have come and labored
[40:36] on a daily basis or as often as you
[40:39] could to assist our brother Kim
[40:41] Dingwald, brother Ben,
[40:45] his son working with him. And then uh
[40:48] their family, I mean there's quite a few
[40:50] of the family that have come. the
[40:52] brother Kim's family, sister Hedi and
[40:55] Beth and and then I want to say that
[40:58] there are other families uh brother Tom
[41:01] Frey and sister Kim their family and
[41:04] their their sons are around there
[41:06] working almost on a daily basis. In
[41:09] fact, as I said to Kim this last week,
[41:11] do you live here?
[41:13] seemed like she lived there every time
[41:15] the meal is on and the sisters have been
[41:17] providing uh evening meal and and lunch
[41:20] at noon and but evening meal and it's
[41:22] just a it's really surprising and
[41:24] amazing what is taking place and it
[41:27] needs to take place. I just saw a little
[41:30] note this last week. The enrollment for
[41:35] the school has gone up 30%
[41:38] over last year of those that want to be
[41:41] there this year. And uh
[41:45] uh we have Sister Sapora is here from
[41:51] Edmonton. Sister Zapora, would you just
[41:53] stand please at the back? Uh they are
[41:59] they are just acquiring a home and four
[42:03] of their five children are being
[42:06] enrolled in the c in the school and
[42:09] that's that just happened very very
[42:12] recently and there are others
[42:15] uh like Sister Zapora and her husband
[42:18] who is in Ghana right now waiting to
[42:23] uh find a way just to be here on a
[42:26] permanent basis.
[42:27] And let's take that up in prayer. I want
[42:30] to say something to the congregation. I
[42:31] just want to speak hearttoheart for a
[42:34] moment.
[42:37] This civilization and the prophet, our
[42:39] prophet said, "This civilization's of
[42:41] the devil." Did he say it?
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Did he say it?
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Do you believe what he said?
[42:50] &gt;&gt; This civilization has has it it's it's
[42:53] wonderful a lot of ways. You can get on
[42:55] a plane and be on the other side of the
[42:57] world in a in a few hours. But also,
[43:01] Satan has used that in his civilization.
[43:04] This is Satan's Eden. And he'll take a
[43:07] family and put a family here and the
[43:09] fathers on the other side of the world
[43:11] or the fathers on the other side of the
[43:13] country. And and yet that's not what's
[43:17] in their heart. What's in their heart is
[43:19] to be home with their family, to be home
[43:21] with their children. And uh and that's
[43:24] God's order. And so I find that we as a
[43:28] body of Jesus Christ, we need to pray
[43:30] and do more than pray. We need to put
[43:33] feet to our to our prayers. And I
[43:37] personally have been working very very
[43:38] hard because I've seen this and just
[43:41] recently I've seen this as a real attack
[43:44] against the program and the structure of
[43:47] God's order for homes, for families, for
[43:50] churches, scatter people all over the
[43:52] face of the globe and and dismember.
[43:55] That's the first thing he did in the
[43:57] Garden of Eden was dismember the family.
[43:59] And we're here to put it back together
[44:01] again. And if the immigration's against
[44:04] it, we're going to try to find a way. If
[44:06] something else is against it, we're
[44:08] going to try to overcome it. And
[44:10] sometimes I I I don't hesitate. If a if
[44:13] a job is going to permanently put a
[44:16] husband and wife and family and father
[44:19] away from each other on a permanent
[44:20] basis, I realize there are times when we
[44:23] have to put our best foot forward and
[44:25] there's an opportunity and we we have to
[44:27] do something. I would say outside of the
[44:30] gospel of Jesus Christ, sometimes the
[44:32] gospel of Jesus Christ calls for men to
[44:36] be away in the ministry and whatever
[44:38] more, but outside of that, I like to see
[44:41] families united. Don't you think so?
[44:44] &gt;&gt; I hope I can have a solid amen out of
[44:47] this congregation. And so, God bless you
[44:50] that are laboring. I can tell you
[44:52] there's there's been incredible amount
[44:54] of uh of of progress that has been made.
[44:57] And I'm anxious for it. not merely for
[44:58] the school. We we need what is being
[45:01] used by the school right now. We need
[45:03] that to expand and extend the missions.
[45:06] We need some of those rooms up there and
[45:08] they're also used for Sunday school. And
[45:10] there are functions which are taking
[45:13] place within the church which we don't
[45:15] have room to handle it right now, but
[45:17] we'll be able to use the school
[45:19] gymnasium for that. And so we're anxious
[45:22] to see it done because we just believe
[45:24] it's God's work. And when it's done,
[45:26] we'll just hand it over in the
[45:28] tribulation. Whoever wants it can have
[45:30] it.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; We're out of here.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; I say we're out of here.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; And they can have it.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Who's going to have it? I don't know.
[45:38] Antichrist or somebody. I couldn't care
[45:40] less.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm doing all this work."
[45:44] No, you're not doing it for him. You're
[45:46] doing it for God. We're do everything as
[45:48] unto the Lord.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; All your giving and all your sacrifice.
[45:52] God bless you. God bless you.
[45:58] I did see on the screen our brother
[46:02] Roger Gerard and Sister Sandra stand up
[46:04] and their daughter. I appreciate that.
[46:06] God bless you, brother Roger, Sister
[46:08] Sandra, your daughter. And uh tonight
[46:11] we're going to be down in Seattle.
[46:14] Uh, I'm going to drive down today
[46:17] because there's going to be a they're
[46:19] going to have like a a little special
[46:20] time of fellowship after and and since
[46:23] they got the new building and brother
[46:25] Tom will be ministering down there. So,
[46:27] we're just thankful for the people from
[46:30] Seattle, Tacoma, Mount Vernon, wherever
[46:32] they come from. Some of our people are
[46:34] away today. This is a long a long
[46:37] weekend holiday weekend in Canada. of
[46:39] some of the people are away and and uh
[46:43] let's stand and I want to sing I'm
[46:46] amazed that he loved me and then we're
[46:49] going to read the scripture mother
[46:56] that he loved me.
[47:06] Yeah.
[47:08] Heat.
[47:22] Heat.
[47:25] Heat.
[47:35] Yeah.
[47:40] Heat.
[47:54] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[48:04] Heat.
[48:05] Heat.
[48:18] Heat.
[48:22] Heat.
[48:42] I see
[48:44] my
[48:51] how we thank you, Father, that you've
[48:54] made yourself known in a perfect
[48:56] redemption.
[48:58] I pray now as we will turn to your word
[49:00] that you will bless your people with an
[49:03] understanding.
[49:05] Bless your people, oh God, with the
[49:08] grace of God, the anointing of the Holy
[49:10] Spirit. May the spirit of revelation be
[49:14] upon us. May every obstacle be moved
[49:17] out, oh God. May there be no hindrance
[49:19] whatsoever in any man, any woman's mind.
[49:22] I pray, Lord, that you will grace us
[49:25] with your presence. All we want is you.
[49:28] Only you, Lord Jesus. I pray that you
[49:31] will endow us with your power. May the
[49:36] word not be in word only, but in
[49:38] demonstration and power of the Holy
[49:40] Spirit. Reach out into the audience, oh
[49:44] God, whether it be here or whether it be
[49:46] streaming elsewhere around the world.
[49:48] Reach out into the rooms. Father, I pray
[49:50] you will rebuke the enemy on behalf of
[49:53] those that are sick, on behalf of those
[49:55] that are afflicted, and may we hear the
[49:57] testimony of deliverance and the
[49:59] creative power of almighty God. And here
[50:02] in the congregation, Father, we're
[50:04] looking for mighty things to take place.
[50:08] Anoint us now, Lord, both speaker and
[50:10] hearers for your glory alone in Jesus
[50:14] name. Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; We certainly give him all the glory.
[50:20] I'll invite you to turn with me to
[50:22] Luke's Gospel
[50:25] the 13th, the 11th chapter.
[50:31] And we're going to begin reading at the
[50:32] fifth verse.
[50:36] And then we'll also turn to First
[50:38] Thessalonians
[50:40] 2 chapter.
[50:55] Luke 11:5.
[50:58] And he said unto them, "Which of you
[51:00] shall have a friend?" And shall say unto
[51:03] him at midnight,
[51:06] and say unto him, "Friend, lend me three
[51:09] loaves.
[51:10] For a friend of mine in his journey is
[51:13] come to me, and I have nothing to set
[51:15] before him."
[51:18] And he from within shall answer and say,
[51:20] "Trouble me not. The door is now shut,
[51:24] and my children are with me in bed. I
[51:27] cannot rise and give thee. I say unto
[51:31] you, though he will not rise and give
[51:33] him because he is his friend, yet
[51:37] because of his importunity,
[51:40] he will rise and give him as much as he
[51:42] has as he needeth. And I say unto you,
[51:46] ask and it shall be given you.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Seek and you shall find. Knock and it
[51:52] shall be opened unto you. For everyone
[51:54] that askketh receiveth, and he that
[51:56] seeketh findeth, and to him that
[51:58] knockketh it shall be opened.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; If a son shall ask bread of of you, that
[52:04] is a father, will you give him a stone?
[52:07] Or if he ask a fish, will he give uh for
[52:11] a fish, give him a serpent? Or if he
[52:14] shall ask an egg, will he offer him a
[52:17] scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know
[52:20] how to give good gifts unto your
[52:22] children, how much more shall your
[52:25] heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to
[52:28] them that ask him?
[52:29] &gt;&gt; How much more,
[52:31] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, shall he give the Holy
[52:33] Spirit, not something else, but the Holy
[52:36] Spirit?
[52:37] &gt;&gt; I will read also in first Thessalonians
[52:40] the 2 chapter.
[52:43] We'll start at verse 7.
[52:47] But we were gentle among you, the
[52:49] Apostle Paul writing, even as a nurse
[52:53] cherisheth cherisheth her children.
[52:57] So being affectionately desirous of you,
[53:00] we were willing to have imparted unto
[53:02] you not the gospel of God only,
[53:08] but also our own souls, because you were
[53:11] dear unto us. For you remember,
[53:14] brethren, our labor and travail, for
[53:17] laboring night and day, because we would
[53:19] not be chargeable unto any of you. We
[53:23] preached unto you the gospel of God.
[53:27] You are witnesses, and God also, how
[53:30] holy and justly and unblamely
[53:34] we behaved ourselves among you that
[53:37] believe. as you also as you know how we
[53:42] exhorted and comforted and charged every
[53:45] one of you as a father doth his children
[53:48] that you would walk worthy of God who
[53:51] hath called you unto his kingdom and
[53:54] glory. Notice please verse 13.
[53:58] For this cause also, thank we God,
[54:01] without ceasing, because when you
[54:05] received the word of God, which you
[54:08] heard of us, you received it not as the
[54:11] word of men,
[54:13] &gt;&gt; but as it is in truth, the word of God,
[54:17] &gt;&gt; which effectively workketh also in you
[54:20] that believe.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; When you receive the word of God, and
[54:25] I'm speaking the second part on
[54:27] receiving him. When you receive the word
[54:30] of God, they could have said, "Well,
[54:33] that's just apostles. That's Apostle
[54:35] Paul's idea, or he was taught under
[54:38] Galius. This is some hangover from Gal
[54:42] or this is something from the
[54:44] Sanhedrin." But when these people who
[54:46] were from Thessalonica heard heard Paul,
[54:51] you received the word of God, which you
[54:54] heard of us. And you received it not as
[54:56] the word of man, but as it is in truth,
[54:59] the word of God, which effectively
[55:02] workketh also in you that believe. It
[55:05] would not have worked effectively if
[55:07] they had received it as the word of man.
[55:11] But as they received it as the word of
[55:13] God, then it worked effectively. That's
[55:15] the automatic reaction to the person
[55:19] who's receiving it.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. You may be
[55:23] seated.
[55:29] You may want to take some notes.
[55:32] If you have a question, it's fine. Put
[55:35] it down.
[55:37] I'd like you to I'd like to God will
[55:40] help me to give more of a study this
[55:44] morning. Last week we had a lot of
[55:46] slides. This week I don't have any but
[55:49] it will need your full attention.
[55:52] I just want to make some statements
[55:54] throughout the service
[55:57] and uh because I'm trying to deal with
[56:00] something that uh I have observed within
[56:04] the message. I'm talking about within
[56:06] the body of believers who hold the
[56:09] message as their faith and the
[56:13] revelation of it.
[56:16] It is today as it was when Jesus was
[56:19] here and as as it always has been in the
[56:21] Old Testament as well. But it is that
[56:24] people hear
[56:26] uh and they receive at various levels.
[56:30] I'm just reiterating the beginning of
[56:32] last week. They received Jesus as uh
[56:36] some received him as the son of Joseph
[56:39] and Mary which he was not. So they were
[56:42] wrong even to begin with
[56:44] &gt;&gt; and obviously could go nowhere with it.
[56:46] That's right.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; There were others that received him as a
[56:49] good man, the Bible says, or they
[56:52] received him as a teacher. They received
[56:55] him as a rabbi.
[56:57] Uh and they received him as a prophet.
[56:59] right?
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Uh they wondered who he was and and even
[57:04] when you start getting to a prophet,
[57:06] they thought that maybe he was John the
[57:08] Baptist that had raised Herod thought
[57:10] that uh they thought that he was u
[57:13] perhaps are you Elias
[57:15] uh or one of the prophets? And Jesus
[57:18] said to the disciples, "Who do men say
[57:20] that I am?" Well, they think that you're
[57:23] maybe one of the prophets
[57:25] uh because they could see that these
[57:27] mighty works and they weren't willing to
[57:28] write the works off, but yet they were
[57:31] not willing to receive the word either.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; And so they had all of these different
[57:36] layers of acceptance
[57:39] &gt;&gt; and recognition.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; And I want to say something right at the
[57:43] very beginning and please take heed to
[57:46] this. When I will be speaking of the
[57:49] respect and the recognition to a person
[57:53] or to an office that a person occupies,
[57:56] don't think for a moment I am speaking
[57:59] on my behalf or on any individual's
[58:03] behalf because the one that does the
[58:06] recognition, the one that does the
[58:08] respecting,
[58:10] they are the ones that benefit. It's
[58:13] not. For example, I'll just use the home
[58:15] for a moment for a quick example. You
[58:18] that are young people, children, and
[58:20] some of you who are now grown and
[58:22] married and and you have some of that
[58:24] earlier life behind you. The respect the
[58:28] Bible says, "Honor thy father and thy
[58:31] mother that thy days may be prolonged on
[58:36] the earth." Yeah.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Doesn't say that your parents' days will
[58:40] be prolonged or that they get the
[58:43] benefit. There isn't any benefit that
[58:45] flows to the one that's respected.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; The benefit flows to the one that does
[58:50] the respecting
[58:52] &gt;&gt; in every case.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; And I will come to a quote where the
[58:55] prophet says that you respect the pastor
[58:58] or respect the deacons. It doesn't do
[59:01] anything for them. You're the one that
[59:04] benefits.
[59:06] respect the prophet of God. And so
[59:08] people say, "Well, Brother Brandham was
[59:10] this. He was that, and I'm going to go
[59:12] through it in depth." Well, he was
[59:14] Malachi 4. And fine, he was more than
[59:16] Malachi 4. Oh, well, he was Luke Luke
[59:20] 17:30. Well, he wasn't Luke 17:30, but
[59:23] he revealed Luke 17:30. He revealed he
[59:26] was a son of man revealing the son of
[59:29] man. And then people uh move forward and
[59:32] say, "Well, I know who William Brham is.
[59:34] I was he God's prophet? Absolutely God's
[59:37] prophet. That's wonderful. But you
[59:39] haven't gone far enough.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; He was the vessel that God hid.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; He was the veil of God so that he could
[59:47] reveal Jesus Christ who was the son of
[59:50] God who came out of the bosom of the
[59:52] father.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; And there's something a whole lot more
[59:54] that we have to get uh other than these
[59:57] aren't just my words. I will
[59:58] substantiate these things as we move
[1:00:00] along. And then Jesus had said, this is
[1:00:04] one of our texts last week. And he came
[1:00:06] to his own, and his own received him
[1:00:09] not, but to as many as received him. To
[1:00:14] them gave he power to become the sons of
[1:00:17] God. It wasn't he who was received that
[1:00:20] got the benefit.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; It was them who received him. They got
[1:00:25] the power to become the sons of God.
[1:00:27] Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; So, please have that established in your
[1:00:31] mind. The beneficiary is the one that
[1:00:34] does the respecting, the honoring, the
[1:00:37] one that gets the revelation.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; You're the one
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; that benefits from it. And so I want you
[1:00:43] all to say within your own heart, "Oh
[1:00:46] God, help me to be in in such a tent of
[1:00:49] it expectation that I will receive the
[1:00:53] full measure of what you have for me
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; out of your word and by the Holy
[1:00:58] Spirit."
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; I want you to receive it not as the word
[1:01:02] of man, but as the word of God today
[1:01:04] over this pullpit.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not here for my health. I'm not here
[1:01:09] because I even want to be here. I'd soon
[1:01:11] or maybe be somewhere else right now.
[1:01:13] But because of a call of God, because of
[1:01:16] the burden of the word of the Lord,
[1:01:18] we're here to to stand at the post of
[1:01:20] duty.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; We're out in not out enjoying the
[1:01:27] sunshine yesterday. Just after many
[1:01:30] hours of just waiting on God, Friday the
[1:01:33] same, and and trying to take care of
[1:01:35] things. So, I don't speak personally. Do
[1:01:38] not take it that way or you're going to
[1:01:39] miss the entire service. The beneficiary
[1:01:42] is the one that does the that that
[1:01:45] checks the office. For example,
[1:01:48] I'll just use it on a natural level.
[1:01:50] Whether it be the prime minister of
[1:01:52] Canada, the premier of the province, uh
[1:01:54] uh the president of the United States,
[1:01:57] you may not agree with the man, but his
[1:02:00] office demands respect.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks of those that are in
[1:02:05] authority. They're they're they're just
[1:02:07] men of the world. They say the Bible
[1:02:10] says he doesn't carry the sword in vain.
[1:02:12] He's an officer on the street. Perhaps
[1:02:14] he's a police officer or whatever more.
[1:02:16] You may not agree with them. They they
[1:02:18] they may have their bad side and all the
[1:02:21] rest of it. That's not that's not the
[1:02:23] point. The point is that the office
[1:02:26] requires some respect.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; The mother father requires respect. The
[1:02:31] Bible teaches that you that are laboring
[1:02:33] for someone who's an employer, you
[1:02:37] respect him as an you may not agree with
[1:02:39] him. You may not even agree with some of
[1:02:41] his tactics or whatever more. You may
[1:02:43] not he said you may say, "Well, he's an
[1:02:45] unbeliever." So, that may be so. But
[1:02:49] that's why the Bible even says we pray
[1:02:50] for our leaders. We pray we pray for We
[1:02:53] may not agree with the system.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; That's not the point. We are a
[1:02:58] beneficiary because God has simply said
[1:03:00] it. And so much more so we agree and uh
[1:03:04] respect the offices that God has
[1:03:07] established for the body of Jesus
[1:03:09] Christ. We respect those. We're required
[1:03:13] to respect it. It's not an option. We're
[1:03:15] required to expect it. Respect it. And
[1:03:18] if people don't, then they are the ones
[1:03:19] who who really suffer as a result of it.
[1:03:22] Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; So when he received the word, he
[1:03:25] received it not as the word of man, but
[1:03:27] as it is in truth, the word of God.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; And God does reveal himself in different
[1:03:33] forms. He reveals himself, don't ask me
[1:03:37] why. I can't explain it, but he reveals
[1:03:39] himself at different levels. He reveals
[1:03:41] and has hid himself. He's been veiled
[1:03:44] behind badger skins. He was veiled in
[1:03:47] the in the Old Testament behind the the
[1:03:50] in in the tabernacle and uh that's just
[1:03:53] the way God does things that but he
[1:03:56] remains the same as the prophet said God
[1:03:58] is in his nature. God is in his
[1:04:01] universe.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Uh God is in his son. God is in his word
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; and God is in his people.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Now that's not to be diluted. As we go
[1:04:12] through, we look at nature, we say, "Oh,
[1:04:14] yes, God's in nature. That God's in his
[1:04:18] people.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; That God is present here this morning."
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; And don't water it down. Say, "Well,
[1:04:24] God's in creation. I see the glory. I
[1:04:26] see the power. I see the magnificent."
[1:04:29] That magnificent God's in his people
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; in no less measure. In fact, is in a
[1:04:36] greater measure. Amen.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; He's not giving eternal life to, you
[1:04:40] know, just things in nature, but he's
[1:04:41] giving eternal life to his children, to
[1:04:43] his family.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; God has hid himself behind veils in the
[1:04:49] unveiling of God. He said he's he he
[1:04:52] always was veiled. Veiled in his church
[1:04:56] with skin on him.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; He was in his human temple, veiled in a
[1:05:00] human being.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; That's always the way that he's been.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; He was in his prophets. Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; He has revealed himself. They weren't
[1:05:09] exactly prophets. Listen, they weren't
[1:05:11] exactly prophets. They were gods.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; With a small G. They were gods. He said
[1:05:16] so. For what they spoke was God's word.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; They were the flesh that God was veiled
[1:05:23] in.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; They were the flesh that God was veiled
[1:05:27] in.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Does this church acknowledge that
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; you do you receive him at that level?
[1:05:35] The prophet was the veil, but the word
[1:05:37] was God.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; If you accept that, you will benefit
[1:05:42] today.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; There's perhaps another level you can
[1:05:46] take it to today.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; He said he never changed his nature,
[1:05:51] only his form. Hebrews 13:8, he's the
[1:05:54] same yesterday, today, and forever. Like
[1:05:56] I change from husband, brother Brandham
[1:05:59] says like I change from husband when my
[1:06:01] child is born. Then I am father.
[1:06:05] When my grandchild is born, I'm
[1:06:07] grandfather.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; But I don't change. It's still me.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; That's God.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; It's just I change my form.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Says another place. But it's the same
[1:06:19] person
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; all the time. The same person.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; God all the time. In this way he reveals
[1:06:26] himself to his people in doing this
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; in changing his form. But this is the
[1:06:32] mystery of it. This is why uh you know
[1:06:35] the world is so given over to its
[1:06:39] knowledge and to what its its its
[1:06:42] ability to learn and wisdom. The wisdom
[1:06:46] of the world is foolishness to God.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Always has been. Still is.
[1:06:52] The world talks about Socrates, but the
[1:06:54] Bible doesn't talk about Socrates or
[1:06:56] Plato or any of these philosophers.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Doesn't talk about them because they
[1:07:02] don't have any place in God's economy.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; God, when he came, he came and he veiled
[1:07:07] himself in in a a poor language, the
[1:07:10] Galilean language, a gutal language that
[1:07:13] was short of perhaps words and
[1:07:15] expressions. He veiled himself. He
[1:07:18] veiled himself by being with the poor
[1:07:20] people, not the sophisticated people, by
[1:07:23] being with the poor people. That's part
[1:07:25] of his veil.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; He veiled himself by uh by being humble
[1:07:31] and being with in humility.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; He h he he veiled himself that way. And
[1:07:37] he's still the same.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; He wants to do exactly the same. God may
[1:07:41] give you nicer clothes or a nicer home
[1:07:44] or nicer. Don't forget God has nothing
[1:07:46] to do with that. That just may be part
[1:07:49] of his blessings. But the real the real
[1:07:52] test is that God remains the same in his
[1:07:55] nature.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; God loves simplicity.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; God loves honesty. God loves integrity.
[1:08:01] God loves purity.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; That God will never change. Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Let's be friends
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; and realize that this is the God that we
[1:08:13] we serve.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; He speaks in a simple language.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, brother Brown, I'm quoting
[1:08:20] him. He hid it from the eyes of the wise
[1:08:22] and the prudent and revealed it unto
[1:08:25] babes such as would learn. So receiving
[1:08:28] him at the depth, at the depth of
[1:08:31] respect, at the depth of reverence, at
[1:08:33] the depth of honor, and to cherish what
[1:08:37] is acceptable with God.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; You know, we should be lovers of those
[1:08:42] things that God loves.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Receiving him to whip. The Bible says
[1:08:49] that God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:08:53] world to himself. But Jesus Christ was
[1:08:56] not popular.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; He was not the popular person we think
[1:09:03] and that that the world, the Christian
[1:09:05] world so-called, has made him to be.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; And beautiful crosses. The cross isn't
[1:09:11] beautiful.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; The cross was bloody. The pro the cross
[1:09:14] was a a a vicious place.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; The cross is an emblem of sorrow and
[1:09:21] shame.
[1:09:24] That's where bad men hung.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; We don't have a nice cross here
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; on the wall. And if we did, I wouldn't
[1:09:34] want it to be that nice.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be identified with
[1:09:40] something that's been refined
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; to that point. Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; God gives a good building or gives a
[1:09:48] good school or gives us whatever
[1:09:49] whatever or good equipment and and men
[1:09:51] that can run it. Wonderful. Only
[1:09:54] wonderful for one point to get this same
[1:09:56] message further out into somebody else's
[1:09:59] heart.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; And if it doesn't get in somebody else's
[1:10:02] heart, I'm not interested in it.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The vision remains the same.
[1:10:07] Yes, sir.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; The commission remains the same. going
[1:10:10] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:10:13] of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; We don't care whether it's refined or
[1:10:16] not. That's not the point. Just get it
[1:10:18] out.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in how beautiful the
[1:10:21] spoken word books are. If they're nice,
[1:10:23] we like to do things nice. We like to
[1:10:25] have it in good quality. But but however
[1:10:28] it gets there, get the word out.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; If you can't preach, you can tell how
[1:10:36] the candle got lit. Tell somebody.
[1:10:39] Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Don't know why I'm on that subject.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; So God was in his prophet
[1:10:45] when when the woman, the Shunomite
[1:10:47] woman,
[1:10:48] and Elijah said to Gahhesi, Gahhesi, his
[1:10:52] his servant, take my staff and go and
[1:10:56] lay it upon the baby. Brother Brandham
[1:10:57] says, "And God has a provided lamb. Take
[1:11:00] this staff and go and lay it on the
[1:11:02] baby." This woman was had she was being
[1:11:05] uh you know she had impertunity as well.
[1:11:08] She was being persistent.
[1:11:11] That's what the one who came to the door
[1:11:13] and I'll come back to that. She was
[1:11:15] being persistent. Take my staff laid on
[1:11:17] the baby. He said he knew everything he
[1:11:21] touched was blessed.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And so you remember he said Paul didn't
[1:11:24] pray over the handkerchiefs. He took
[1:11:26] them off of his body.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; That was the prophet's faith. Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; So you see, he said, "Take my staff, and
[1:11:35] if anybody salutes you, don't salute
[1:11:36] back. Lay it on the baby." But the
[1:11:39] woman's faith wasn't in the staff. It
[1:11:42] was in the prophet.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Her faith wasn't in what the man
[1:11:48] touched.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Her faith wasn't even in the man. But
[1:11:51] she recognized she was he had the word
[1:11:54] of God.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; He had the word of life.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; So her faith wasn't in the staff. It was
[1:12:00] in the prophet and she said, "I'll not
[1:12:02] leave. As surely as your soul lives, I'm
[1:12:06] not going to leave you."
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; That's what gave life to her child.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:17] When Jesus was here,
[1:12:20] the
[1:12:22] very upright and people who they
[1:12:25] couldn't lay your finger on, scribes,
[1:12:26] Pharisees, and so on. And they said, "If
[1:12:29] we had been in the days of our fathers,
[1:12:31] we would not have been partakers with
[1:12:34] them in the blood of the prophets."
[1:12:37] Nothing really changes. Wherefore, Jesus
[1:12:40] said, "Wherefore, ye be witnesses unto
[1:12:43] yourselves that you are the children of
[1:12:45] them that killed the prophets."
[1:12:47] Nothing's changed. You You're upholding
[1:12:50] the same thing your fathers upheld.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And why did they kill the prophets?
[1:12:54] Because they didn't receive them.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; The prophets, the prophets weren't
[1:13:04] damaged
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; when the people didn't receive them. The
[1:13:08] prophets weren't even damaged when they
[1:13:10] got killed.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; But what did it do for those that did
[1:13:15] the did the rejecting? It heaped
[1:13:17] condemnation upon them.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; They were the recipients of their own
[1:13:22] rejection.
[1:13:30] So you need to be so careful
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; and we are so careful that we abide and
[1:13:36] stay with the program of God.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; God in the form,
[1:13:48] fire in the bush, a light, a dove, a
[1:13:50] lamb, a man, the Holy Spirit, the pillar
[1:13:53] of fire, a human being, Christ in the
[1:13:56] word.
[1:13:58] It is nigh unto impossible,
[1:14:02] and I'm careful with I'm being selective
[1:14:04] with my words, but it's nigh unto
[1:14:07] impossible
[1:14:08] to give due honor
[1:14:11] and respect and worship to the very
[1:14:15] person of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:17] Unless the Holy Spirit reveals
[1:14:21] him to us
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; in the form that God has chosen to show
[1:14:26] himself in that particular time.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] In modern events made clear Jesus when
[1:14:37] he come he was a prophet and today
[1:14:42] before Jesus comes again the full
[1:14:45] manifestation
[1:14:47] of the person
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; of the person of Jesus Christ is
[1:14:52] manifested in flesh
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; how do we how do we give sufficient
[1:15:01] recognition and response and and
[1:15:03] reverence
[1:15:05] to the word. We say the message be
[1:15:08] careful folks
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; be careful
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; if we really really in depth
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; and we say it's revealed to us that's
[1:15:18] the word of God in that vessel
[1:15:22] how casually are we taking that how
[1:15:25] casually do we deal that deal with that
[1:15:29] like I've said and I don't hesitate
[1:15:31] saying it
[1:15:34] the message is not background music.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; I'll turn it on and you know just hear
[1:15:42] it and around the house. That's fine.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; But make sure you take quality time
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; and sit down
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; and hear
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; what God delivered
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; to this generation.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; And today before Jesus comes again, the
[1:15:59] full manifestation of the person of
[1:16:01] Jesus Christ is to be manifested in
[1:16:04] flesh. He said, "Think of it."
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "As it was in the days of
[1:16:09] Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of
[1:16:11] the Son of Man. When the Son of Man is
[1:16:14] being revealed, uh what is revealed,
[1:16:16] unfolded, made known, the secret had
[1:16:20] been brought forth, revealed."
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And listen friends, the you know, we
[1:16:25] have seven seals. The seven seals have
[1:16:28] been open, etc., etc. The book uh the
[1:16:31] seven seals, that book's not another
[1:16:32] book. That book is a secret
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; that was in God's mind
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; and you have the privilege
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; of actually seeing what was in God's
[1:16:43] mind
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:16:47] revealed. Brother Brandham says what was
[1:16:49] way in the back of God's mind.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Way in the back of God's
[1:16:56] mind. And I want to just give you
[1:16:58] something simple which I've spoken here
[1:17:00] many times but I'm putting it I'm really
[1:17:02] laying it in your lap. A prophet stands
[1:17:05] here and perhaps a woman stands there
[1:17:06] and he says you were you were uh before
[1:17:10] two doctors. They're rather large men.
[1:17:13] You were before them. That's yesterday
[1:17:16] or last week. He she was before them.
[1:17:20] And he says I hear them speaking.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Where's he? Amen.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; She they she was there some days ago in
[1:17:27] an office in another building maybe in
[1:17:29] another town. Here's a man standing
[1:17:31] here. What kind of vessel is that? I
[1:17:33] hear them speaking and tells her what
[1:17:36] they said
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; and then tells her what will be.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; If God knows what was
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; and I this is my comment. If he can go
[1:17:47] back yesterday or last week, can he not
[1:17:50] go back a hundred years or a thousand
[1:17:52] years or millennia into the mind of God?
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Way back before there was a blade of
[1:17:59] grass,
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; before any human drew breath,
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; before there was a creation
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; and bring it down to you. That's the
[1:18:10] seals. Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Sure. In the seals, it sure speaks about
[1:18:15] say the Roman Catholic Church cuz he
[1:18:17] knew it would be here. He knew it would
[1:18:19] be here in its refinement, in its glory,
[1:18:22] and all of its sophistication. And he
[1:18:24] knew that Satan would put his uh put his
[1:18:27] nest himself there, put his throne there
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; and and have its control over the
[1:18:33] peoples of the earth. And God is
[1:18:35] demonstrating and showing how he hates
[1:18:37] that thing. And way before the
[1:18:40] foundation of the earth, he already
[1:18:41] called her a harlot.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; You call her the great harlot.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give the wind a mighty
[1:18:48] voice. Let this sound go.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Let the internet hear it. Let every
[1:18:53] people who heard it receive it.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God knew she was a harlot.
[1:18:58] God knew she was unfaithful.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; And that man would sit there and all the
[1:19:03] pump and all the glory, all of it's
[1:19:05] man's glory. Yes,
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; this church ought to be in full
[1:19:09] agreement with that. I tell you what,
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; that's a cursed system.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; And God's going to cast her in a fire,
[1:19:15] lake of fire.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] So, we have receiving
[1:19:28] by hearing of the ear
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; and then receiving
[1:19:33] by appropriating. If you hear something
[1:19:35] today friends, you and you say that is
[1:19:39] true. I accept that. Brother Bisco,
[1:19:43] preach it. I accept that.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Then you're duty bound to go out of
[1:19:47] these doors and appropriate what you
[1:19:49] heard.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Say that's what the word says. That's
[1:19:52] what the vindicated message says. And
[1:19:54] I'm going out of here and doing it.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not a lot of legalism.
[1:20:03] It doesn't have nothing to do with
[1:20:04] legalism.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; That's a word that man has invented. Has
[1:20:07] nothing to do with legalism. It has to
[1:20:09] do with we finally see who he is.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Like a young man, young woman coming to
[1:20:18] get married and will you be true? Will
[1:20:21] you be faithful to this man, this woman
[1:20:24] alone as long as you both shall live?
[1:20:27] It's a commitment.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; It don't say, "Oh man, that's a whole
[1:20:31] bunch of legalism." you. Nobody talks
[1:20:34] about legalism.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; I read a a little note. I sent it to my
[1:20:41] wife that uh somebody said, and I I I
[1:20:47] I'm glad I don't have his kind of
[1:20:48] marriage, but he said that the wedding
[1:20:51] rings were the smallest handcuffs in the
[1:20:53] world.
[1:20:59] If you feel that way,
[1:21:02] if you're truly married on a love basis,
[1:21:06] you don't consider them handcuffs. I've
[1:21:09] never thought that this was a handcuff,
[1:21:12] dear. Do you
[1:21:15] Did you put handcuffs on me?
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; It's not handcuffs.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; It's not some bondage.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; It's a love affair.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; For this cause also, Paul, I'm repeating
[1:21:35] this scripture.
[1:21:37] Uh we thank God without ceasing.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; We thank God without ceasing. Paul was
[1:21:44] filled with thanksgiving because when
[1:21:47] you heard the word, when you heard the
[1:21:50] word, when you received it, the word of
[1:21:54] God which you heard of us,
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; you received it. Not as two different
[1:21:59] words. When you received it, as I showed
[1:22:01] last week on the on the screen,
[1:22:03] paralambo, when you received the word of
[1:22:06] God that you heard from us, you received
[1:22:09] it not as the word of men, but as it is
[1:22:11] the word of God.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Those people took that and said, "We've
[1:22:15] heard the word of God."
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Think what would happen if we walked out
[1:22:18] of here today and I just say, "God,
[1:22:21] God's the one that can sort it out." But
[1:22:23] if we walked out of here today and said,
[1:22:25] "We've quoted from the messenger.
[1:22:29] We've quoted uh and stayed with that
[1:22:32] word just as close as we know how." Some
[1:22:34] might say, "Well, there's a whole lot of
[1:22:36] quotes." That's the level your benefit
[1:22:37] will come.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; I could read all the Bible. And someone
[1:22:42] could say, "Well, I can go home and read
[1:22:43] all of that." All he did was read
[1:22:45] scripture.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Uh all he did was give some quotes. I
[1:22:49] can go home and read those quotes. But
[1:22:51] when the Holy Spirit says, "Say it this
[1:22:54] way.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Put it this way and structure it in this
[1:22:57] order." That's the way he wants it to
[1:22:59] come into your mind and into your heart.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And if you hear it, it'll produce faith.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me you don't need faith.
[1:23:09] Everybody in here needs faith at some
[1:23:12] level.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; This is still a God who cast the all of
[1:23:19] the galaxies out in space. that God can
[1:23:21] work on your behalf
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; on my behalf. And we have something we
[1:23:26] need him to do. Let's receive the word
[1:23:28] as it is the word of God indeed.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; And you can have what you ask.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus was preaching. That's
[1:23:37] what he was saying.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:51] All right. I
[1:23:55] There's a big difference between
[1:23:57] receiving
[1:23:59] the word as it is the word of man or
[1:24:02] receiving it as it is indeed the word of
[1:24:05] God. Receiving the word as it is in
[1:24:08] truth, the word of God.
[1:24:11] receiving
[1:24:12] this Christ, receiving this message at a
[1:24:16] different level.
[1:24:19] And now we just come to this scripture
[1:24:24] and this person
[1:24:28] and Jesus is saying, "Which of you shall
[1:24:31] have a friend?"
[1:24:35] There's friends and then there's
[1:24:37] friends.
[1:24:43] And sometimes we find that a friend
[1:24:47] uh
[1:24:50] was a friend for a certain period of
[1:24:52] time.
[1:24:56] Uh
[1:24:58] I know of marriages that have come apart
[1:25:02] and uh the partners say, "Well, we're
[1:25:05] we're the best of friends."
[1:25:07] Well, I don't understand that, but it
[1:25:10] means something to them. I guess they
[1:25:12] have some they interpreted, we have some
[1:25:13] association. We're the best of friends
[1:25:16] or we still have remained as friends.
[1:25:20] And Jesus said, "Which of you shall have
[1:25:22] a friend?" I'd like you to notice how
[1:25:24] this is used.
[1:25:26] And shall go unto him at midnight. He
[1:25:28] said, "Well, I'm I have a friend."
[1:25:31] And now
[1:25:33] this friend said, "A friend of mine
[1:25:38] has come."
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; So now this one is here at this at her
[1:25:43] friend's door
[1:25:46] and what do you want? It's midnight.
[1:25:49] I need three loaves of bread.
[1:25:53] Uh don't trouble me. I I'm in bed and
[1:25:57] the door's locked and my children are in
[1:25:59] bed and they just keep pounding because
[1:26:03] they says a friend of mine
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; came. So when that friend of theirs
[1:26:08] came, they got up.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; They got dressed.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; They went down the road to their
[1:26:14] friend's place.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And so they all got a different
[1:26:17] understanding what friendship is.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; I got a friend come to my door and I
[1:26:22] don't have anything to offer them. So,
[1:26:24] I've come to you because you're my
[1:26:26] friend.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; And this friend says, "No, you know,
[1:26:30] just leave me alone. I'm in bed and the
[1:26:33] door's closed and everything is
[1:26:35] everything's the way it should be." But
[1:26:37] they kept pounding. And Jesus is saying
[1:26:40] here, I say unto you, though he will not
[1:26:44] rise and give him because of that he is
[1:26:48] a friend.
[1:26:49] So he didn't rise and give him and
[1:26:51] respond to this need because of
[1:26:54] friendship. Said he will not rise and
[1:26:57] give him uh because he's a friend yet
[1:27:00] because of his importunity
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; because of his importunity. And that
[1:27:06] importunity is a you know a a persistent
[1:27:11] annoying
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; aggravating almost. It's someone that
[1:27:15] can get on your nerves
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; because you just prevail.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; You cannot deny me.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; I am your friend.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; What do you say? Oh, father God, I'm
[1:27:28] coming and I am your son.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; The prodal son knew and he came home. He
[1:27:36] said, "My father's servants are better
[1:27:39] off than me in this pig pen.
[1:27:42] I'm going to return back to my father,
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; my father, because he even treats his
[1:27:47] servants better than I'm being treated.
[1:27:50] And I will say to my father, I've sinned
[1:27:52] against you, but I'm coming home and
[1:27:55] make me as one of your hired servants.
[1:27:58] But that father, he he he had a
[1:28:01] revelation of the offices. He knew he
[1:28:03] was father and he knew this was his son.
[1:28:06] And he knew this son had been a
[1:28:07] scoundrel and had taken half the estate
[1:28:10] and blew it
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; right
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; on a foul living and righteous living
[1:28:15] and who knows what he spent it on.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't hardly want to think of what
[1:28:21] he spent it on. He spent it foolishly
[1:28:24] and he came home broke.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; And the father had a right to say serves
[1:28:30] you right.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; I give you half of my estate and you
[1:28:33] blew the whole works. I worked hard for
[1:28:36] that.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; But the father had a revelation also. I
[1:28:41] am the father
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; and he is my son
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; and his son has come back home.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in material things.
[1:28:50] I'm interested in sunship.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, there isn't anybody
[1:28:56] here. We blew it.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God give us health and we blow
[1:29:02] the health. He gives us all. He gives us
[1:29:05] friendship. He gives us spiritual
[1:29:07] blessings. And sometimes we just blow
[1:29:09] it. We're you know we're we're just
[1:29:11] laxidasical about it. He wants to do
[1:29:14] something and he wants to change us.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; And he comes time after time in a
[1:29:19] meeting by the Holy Spirit
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; and we fail to see it. We fail to grasp
[1:29:24] who he is.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen
[1:29:30] friends, I I'm I'm not saying this for
[1:29:33] my benefit cuz I don't get the benefit
[1:29:35] you do.
[1:29:40] I understand, if I understand the
[1:29:42] message correctly, a man of God who
[1:29:45] gives counsel, he may even say not
[1:29:48] exactly the correct thing, but if you
[1:29:50] will honor the office,
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; if you will honor the office, God will
[1:29:56] make it come out right for you.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Not because the council was exactly
[1:30:01] right, but because your attitude was
[1:30:04] right.
[1:30:06] And God responds to your attitude.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; And somehow when it is brought to you,
[1:30:11] it comes right.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; I'm just starting on that.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Prophet speaks about your approach. Your
[1:30:25] approach.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; And he takes in believe thou this and
[1:30:29] then also in other messages perseverant.
[1:30:33] He takes the approach and one of the
[1:30:34] people he speaks about at length in
[1:30:37] different messages is Martha
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; and Mary. But Martha and they and Mary
[1:30:44] had sent word to Jesus,
[1:30:47] your friend,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Lazarus
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; is sick.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; They weren't coming just to another
[1:30:56] another person. They were coming to the
[1:30:58] one that they had given their lives for.
[1:31:01] They were coming to the one that they
[1:31:02] had got kicked out of church for. They
[1:31:05] were no longer accepted by the scribes
[1:31:07] and the Pharisees and and that's the
[1:31:09] basis they were we were coming to you.
[1:31:12] We've given everything to come to you
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; and now your friend is sick
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; and he journeys to another city until
[1:31:20] the friend dies.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Now put yourself there.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Don't put yourself up here a couple
[1:31:27] thousand years.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Put yourself back then.
[1:31:31] So, you know what? I called for the
[1:31:33] ministry. You know what? I called for
[1:31:34] brother Ed
[1:31:37] and I wasn't I wasn't all that bad, but
[1:31:39] this thing has gotten really really
[1:31:41] things took a big downturn. He never
[1:31:44] even came by my door. Didn't even come
[1:31:46] and visit me. Don't tell me you wouldn't
[1:31:49] have some little feelings.
[1:31:54] We are just that way. I called for
[1:31:56] brother. I called for I called for my
[1:31:59] father. I called for
[1:32:02] my mom.
[1:32:06] Now it's going to get real quiet.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; That's just the way I want it.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; God will honor you
[1:32:15] for your respect.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; To your mother, your father.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? Because it's an office.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; I've gone through this before. I'll go
[1:32:28] through it again. Maybe some of you
[1:32:30] haven't been here in the past, but when
[1:32:34] a child is born in the world, it's a
[1:32:36] girl. Another child is born in the
[1:32:38] world, it's a boy. And as they come into
[1:32:41] the world, they have certain they have
[1:32:43] certain rights because they have come
[1:32:44] into the human community.
[1:32:47] You cannot abuse that child. You cannot
[1:32:49] do it something that would be a
[1:32:54] unacceptable in the human community
[1:32:56] because they have they they're to be
[1:32:58] fed. We have a catastrophe right now
[1:33:01] taking place over in Somalia and
[1:33:03] Ethiopia about 10 people and there's
[1:33:05] just all kinds of pages of ads and
[1:33:08] because people the world community, the
[1:33:10] United Nations, everybody else is
[1:33:11] wanting to, you know, do everything you
[1:33:13] can. The Canadian government will match
[1:33:15] your donation to to feed these people.
[1:33:18] have sent over $50 million. Hope it gets
[1:33:20] there.
[1:33:22] But because the child has rights, but
[1:33:25] now it becomes a young fellow.
[1:33:28] He has a right to an education. She has
[1:33:30] a right to an education. But now they
[1:33:32] get some responsibilities. Okay, honey.
[1:33:35] Do I want you to do the dishes and you
[1:33:37] go out and get some wood or mow the
[1:33:39] lawn. Now they get a little bit older.
[1:33:41] When they get about 15, 16 years old,
[1:33:43] they say, "Hey, Dad, you know, I got my
[1:33:45] learner's license. What about the car,
[1:33:49] Brother Alan King? Yeah, thank you,
[1:33:52] brother Allen. You sent me
[1:33:56] Sometimes I get this kind of notice. It
[1:33:58] It helps me out even in preaching.
[1:34:00] Uh boy came to his dad and he said,
[1:34:03] "Hey, Dad.
[1:34:05] Uh I got my driver's license now. Can I
[1:34:07] get the keys to the car?"
[1:34:10] He said, 'Well, I've been thinking about
[1:34:11] that
[1:34:13] and I'd like you to do a couple of
[1:34:15] things for me.
[1:34:17] He said, 'I want you to
[1:34:21] bring your grades up
[1:34:23] from B or from C to average B. Bring all
[1:34:29] your grades up.
[1:34:31] And number two,
[1:34:34] I want you to read your Bible. I want
[1:34:37] you to study it.
[1:34:39] and take time with your Bible every day.
[1:34:43] And number three, I want you to get a
[1:34:45] haircut,
[1:34:47] he thought for a moment,
[1:34:50] okay, you have we have a deal. So some
[1:34:53] weeks went by,
[1:34:56] help help me to get back to where I was.
[1:34:59] So, some weeks went by and uh he came to
[1:35:03] his dad and his dad said, 'You know,
[1:35:05] son, I I've I've noticed that you've
[1:35:07] brought your grades up and I've been
[1:35:09] very pleased with that and you've
[1:35:11] brought them up to B average. I'm happy
[1:35:14] with that. And I've noticed that you've
[1:35:16] been reading your Bible every day and
[1:35:19] actually giving some quality time and
[1:35:21] studying your Bible.
[1:35:24] Uh
[1:35:26] and he said, "And I'm happy with that."
[1:35:27] But he says, "You still haven't gotten a
[1:35:29] haircut."
[1:35:31] Well, he said, "You know, Dad, that's
[1:35:33] interesting." He said, "As I was reading
[1:35:34] the Bible,
[1:35:38] as I was reading the Bible,
[1:35:42] uh, it appears that John the Baptist had
[1:35:44] long hair
[1:35:45] and the prophets had long hair." And
[1:35:48] there's good reason to believe that even
[1:35:50] Jesus had long hair. And uh, his father
[1:35:53] said, "Uh, well, that's right." He said,
[1:35:56] "In your studies, did you notice that
[1:35:58] they all walked as well?"
[1:36:06] So, they hadn't quite got the full
[1:36:07] message.
[1:36:10] See, it's not a matter of,
[1:36:13] you know, exactly what's being said.
[1:36:16] It's a matter of who is saying it.
[1:36:19] The office of the father or mother is
[1:36:23] absolutely so significant
[1:36:26] and uh it is this acknowledgement. Then
[1:36:29] you see these young couples
[1:36:32] or young men, young woman and then they
[1:36:35] become beyond that and young man, young
[1:36:39] woman see have eyes for each other and
[1:36:42] say you know I think I like this person.
[1:36:44] Sometime they come to me and say I think
[1:36:47] that I have a liking for this person. I
[1:36:50] I said I always ask do you think it's
[1:36:52] mutual? Uh yeah I think so. Uh what
[1:36:56] makes you think that? Well I was walking
[1:36:58] through the foyer and I happened to see
[1:37:00] her looking at me. Oh that's that's
[1:37:02] really supernatural. So uh so anyway we
[1:37:06] go on from there. But let's just say
[1:37:07] that finally it does come around to be
[1:37:10] uh uh an engagement. Now, now they
[1:37:15] become
[1:37:16] you know engaged or betrothed to one
[1:37:19] another and that becomes very serious
[1:37:22] because they are approaching into an
[1:37:25] office
[1:37:26] and then they become married and that's
[1:37:29] why it's such a sacred thing because now
[1:37:32] he becomes a husband
[1:37:35] and she becomes a wife and those are
[1:37:38] offices. They have now entered into
[1:37:40] offices that God has ordained.
[1:37:44] And then that office becomes compounded.
[1:37:48] Then comes life and children come and
[1:37:50] she becomes a mother. You ought to read
[1:37:53] what the Bible says about mothers and he
[1:37:56] becomes a father. He becomes a provider.
[1:38:00] He enters into an office. And God
[1:38:03] requires that office be regarded and and
[1:38:06] and respected. And that is why here
[1:38:09] comes Elijah the prophet and he speaks
[1:38:11] on church order.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; He speaks on the position of of of of
[1:38:16] the deacons and the five-fold ministry
[1:38:19] and the trustees. He lays it out because
[1:38:21] they're offices.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; He's not he's not trying to say
[1:38:24] something glamorous about the men.
[1:38:26] Right.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; And when he spoke about it and he was
[1:38:29] telling about uh the the vessel that the
[1:38:32] prophets avail and and he he describes
[1:38:34] it that uh this messenger of of of
[1:38:37] revelation uh 3 and 14 and this
[1:38:40] revelation of revelation 10 and he
[1:38:43] describes that and that revelation 10:1
[1:38:46] is Christ. it is Christ and 10:7 is to
[1:38:50] reveal him
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; and he is the fulfillment of 17 uh uh
[1:38:55] Luke 17 and 30 and he puts and then he
[1:38:58] says and don't think that I'm speaking
[1:39:00] about myself
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; then I'll I'll show you places where he
[1:39:05] said I'm no prophet
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; why was he saying that because he was
[1:39:10] actually he was indeed a prophet
[1:39:12] revealing what was in the man's heart
[1:39:14] who had approached him because the man
[1:39:17] didn't believe he was a prophet.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; So, he simply said what was in his
[1:39:21] heart. I'm no prophet.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Said it several times. Now, how do you
[1:39:25] get that? And then yet, on the other
[1:39:27] hand, bring it right down to such a fine
[1:39:30] line that people even have a hard time
[1:39:32] separating a son of man revealing the
[1:39:36] son of man and God himself veiled behind
[1:39:39] the skin and in the flesh and revealed
[1:39:42] again in a human being. All of that is
[1:39:44] absolutely the truth. And I received
[1:39:47] those words not as a word of a man but
[1:39:51] as indeed it is the word of God.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; When did you ever receive Hey you young
[1:39:58] people, you got Google and do all your
[1:40:00] all your uh uh research in history. Find
[1:40:03] me another ministry like that. And when
[1:40:05] you do, come and show me. Come and tell
[1:40:07] me about it. Find another ministry in
[1:40:10] history. You can go through all the
[1:40:12] philosophers and all the great men and
[1:40:14] all the mediums and whatever more.
[1:40:16] You'll never find another ministry like
[1:40:18] that. I haven't been able to find it.
[1:40:20] And the reason I say you won't because
[1:40:22] the Bible doesn't speak of another one.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible says there'll be this one.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; When you got Vancouver and Tel Aviv and
[1:40:31] San Francisco and all the places in the
[1:40:33] world with their gay parades, I tell you
[1:40:36] what a sight of uncleanness. What an age
[1:40:39] we're living in.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed God hasn't already destroyed
[1:40:43] this world.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; And we're here for a purpose
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; to live in this unclean world, dark
[1:40:52] world as a light. And you only have
[1:40:54] light because the revealed word of God
[1:40:56] is light.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Help me out.
[1:41:05] Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; And the same principles apply. The same
[1:41:11] identical principles apply as we find
[1:41:13] them in the in the scripture and in the
[1:41:16] scripture which we read. this friend
[1:41:18] coming to another friend and and brother
[1:41:21] Brandham taking that and and speaking
[1:41:23] about Martha and this is what she said
[1:41:26] and and he was referring to Elijah for a
[1:41:28] moment and she wouldn't she wouldn't uh
[1:41:31] accept Elijah or Elijah coming and but
[1:41:34] but then he switches right away and he
[1:41:36] comes to uh uh to Martha he said if God
[1:41:40] was in Elijah surely he was in his son
[1:41:43] this is in Martha's thinking now if he's
[1:41:46] in his in is Elijah. He's certainly in
[1:41:48] his son. And she knew if she could get
[1:41:51] to him, she could find why her brother
[1:41:54] died. He now he'd already died. She'd
[1:41:57] asked him to come. I want every person
[1:42:00] in this congregation to put yourself
[1:42:02] back there to see where you are here
[1:42:04] today.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Put yourself back there to see where you
[1:42:11] are today.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Now, your loved one has died and he
[1:42:15] didn't come. He even went to another
[1:42:17] city and waited and didn't come.
[1:42:20] But your your heart is saying if God was
[1:42:24] in Elijah and I'm confident that this is
[1:42:26] his son. She uh and she pushed on by
[1:42:32] them critics. She had lots of people
[1:42:34] around coming to bewail the death of her
[1:42:37] brother, but she pushed by the critics
[1:42:39] and went right on out. And Jesus hadn't
[1:42:43] got to town yet. And she got to where he
[1:42:45] was.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And now watch. He said, look like she
[1:42:50] had a right to upgrade him.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Looked like she had a right to scold him
[1:42:57] and say, "Why didn't you come?"
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; See, that would have been an attitude of
[1:43:04] a average person perhaps. And I pray it
[1:43:07] wouldn't be anyone here
[1:43:12] that would have that kind of attitude.
[1:43:15] And oh, I thought you could heal. If she
[1:43:18] would have if she would, the miracle
[1:43:21] would never have taken place.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; So often, friends, I'm going to bear
[1:43:27] right down. So often things that we want
[1:43:29] to have happen so deeply don't happen
[1:43:34] because our approach to the office of
[1:43:37] God is incorrect. Our approach to the
[1:43:40] messenger that brought this message is
[1:43:43] not right. Our approach to one another
[1:43:46] isn't right. Our approach to husbands
[1:43:48] and wives needs to be corrected.
[1:43:55] And the scripture, this scripture you
[1:43:57] love says that Sarah called her husband
[1:44:00] Lord
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; not because she thought he was perhaps
[1:44:05] extra especially spiritual but it was
[1:44:08] his office
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; and she was approaching his office.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, he lied but it was still Abraham.
[1:44:20] Yes, the prophet said he backslid and
[1:44:22] went to Gar, but he was still Abraham.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Nothing would change that he was
[1:44:27] Abraham.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Listen, the gift and calling are without
[1:44:30] repentance. You were born who you are,
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; and you've been given the gift of God,
[1:44:35] and God will never repent over that.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; People who are ministers, I say
[1:44:44] ministers, ministers indeed. If you talk
[1:44:47] to them as I have talked to them, that's
[1:44:49] the last thing in the world they want.
[1:44:50] They don't want to be behind the
[1:44:51] pullpit. They don't want to spend their
[1:44:53] day studying. They don't want to spend
[1:44:55] their life serving. They don't want to
[1:44:57] do all the counseling and hearing of
[1:44:59] the, you know, the trouble and the woes
[1:45:01] and try to fix things. And the burden
[1:45:03] bearer, they don't want to bear the
[1:45:05] burdens. You understand that? And people
[1:45:07] have said to me kind of smiling, "Well,
[1:45:08] you're a burden bearer. you know, the
[1:45:10] the ox of the team, you're a burden
[1:45:11] bearer. That's not what I want to hear.
[1:45:14] I tell my wife, if I only had my burdens
[1:45:16] in this life, it'd be a cakewalk.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; It'd be simple. I only have to worry
[1:45:22] about, you know, earning enough to keep
[1:45:24] family and soul and skin together.
[1:45:26] That'd be fine. That's not the thing.
[1:45:29] And so, it's it's it's an office. And
[1:45:32] people approach an office.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is, friends. It's
[1:45:36] an office. and the wife is an office.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; You children when you go to your mom and
[1:45:42] brother Bar Brown said one of the things
[1:45:43] he hates to hear somebody calling their
[1:45:45] mother and father the old man and the
[1:45:48] old woman.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; He said and then God calls them off the
[1:45:51] scene
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; and you and you see them wheel them out
[1:45:53] of the out of the room head first.
[1:45:56] You'll find out. He said that was your
[1:45:58] best friend on earth.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; You young people ought to say amen.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:10] I was a fairly young man and I held I
[1:46:13] held my dad's hand right here in the
[1:46:16] Vancouver General Hospital.
[1:46:20] This house that we were just building
[1:46:21] here
[1:46:23] 40 years ago,
[1:46:25] by the way, was a young church and I had
[1:46:28] this lot. Anyway, I won't go into a lot
[1:46:30] of detail, but we were building it and I
[1:46:32] talked to my dad the night before and
[1:46:34] said uh he was going to come and help me
[1:46:38] to lay some weeping tile around the
[1:46:40] basement. And so he was going to come,
[1:46:42] he was going to try and get my
[1:46:43] brother-in-law to come and it didn't
[1:46:45] work out. And so I said, "Okay." I said,
[1:46:47] "Why don't you come over early and we'll
[1:46:49] have breakfast and then just go on up to
[1:46:52] the site."
[1:46:54] Okay, that was the plan. Okay, Dad. I'll
[1:46:56] see you in the morning. That was my last
[1:46:58] words.
[1:46:59] I just wasn't I didn't know which
[1:47:01] morning it was.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; I'll see you in the morning.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; And in the morning, he didn't come. He
[1:47:08] didn't come for breakfast. So, I
[1:47:09] thought, well, he's got tied up. He's
[1:47:11] trying to find my brother-in-law and so
[1:47:13] and so. Anyway, I went up here just over
[1:47:15] here on 180th. And I'm there and my wife
[1:47:18] drives up in the station wagon and she I
[1:47:20] can see a strange look on her face and
[1:47:23] she said, "Ed, I think you better come.
[1:47:25] Your dad's been taken to the hospital in
[1:47:27] an ambulance. Oh. I said, "What
[1:47:29] happened?" Said, "Well, I don't know.
[1:47:30] The woman in in the house that lives
[1:47:32] upstairs said she found him laying on
[1:47:35] the floor."
[1:47:37] Oh, I said, "He must have hit his head.
[1:47:39] He must have fell and hit his head." I
[1:47:41] just I couldn't accept. My dad and I
[1:47:43] were taken like brothers. We He was so
[1:47:46] youthful. And anyway, in a hour or so,
[1:47:49] they said, "Well, you better get his
[1:47:51] health record and get down to the
[1:47:54] hospital." And I went down, walked into
[1:47:56] the emergency, met one of the doctors,
[1:47:58] and I said, "Uh, I'm I'm Ed Biscll, Fred
[1:48:01] Biscll's son." He said, "Well, I I said,
[1:48:04] "What happened?" He said, "I think he's
[1:48:07] had a massive cerebral hemorrhage."
[1:48:10] What? And I walked in behind the curtain
[1:48:13] and they shaved part of my dad's head
[1:48:15] and he had aged 20 years from last night
[1:48:20] to this morning. He just aged 20 years.
[1:48:24] and he was in a deep unconscious state
[1:48:26] and I took and I held his hand and uh
[1:48:30] God began to deal with me and let me
[1:48:32] know that he was going and I I I refused
[1:48:34] it. I just refused it. I just could not
[1:48:36] accept it. He's he's strong. He's
[1:48:39] health. He's never hardly been sick. And
[1:48:41] one time then I had one day I just had
[1:48:43] to hold his hand and I said, "God, I
[1:48:47] don't know where dad is.
[1:48:50] Uh, I know from the message that they're
[1:48:53] here by their senses. They see, they
[1:48:55] hear, they smell, they taste, they feel.
[1:48:58] And he hasn't got those senses. All he's
[1:49:01] doing laying here breathing, breathing
[1:49:03] strong. His chest just billowing out,
[1:49:07] you know, he's such a strong man. And I
[1:49:10] said, he's not here.
[1:49:14] I don't know where he is.
[1:49:17] If you could bring him, I'm believing
[1:49:18] that he'll raise up. he has to raise up.
[1:49:21] But 6 days they operated and
[1:49:26] um said he'll probably just last a short
[1:49:29] time and he did just another few days
[1:49:31] and slipped away.
[1:49:34] And I didn't get a chance to talk to
[1:49:39] my father who was my best friend. He
[1:49:42] really was my best friend. And the
[1:49:45] prophet said, "Someday, and if time goes
[1:49:47] on, you'll remember this service and
[1:49:50] these words,
[1:49:52] somebody that's very close to you and
[1:49:54] somebody you love. You'll see them wheel
[1:49:57] them out, like you said, head first."
[1:50:01] And you'll attend a funeral. You say,
[1:50:03] "Well, I didn't get a chance to say what
[1:50:05] I wanted to say. I didn't I didn't have
[1:50:08] an opportunity."
[1:50:10] Part of my service today is that we need
[1:50:14] to respect
[1:50:16] with a godly respect the offices.
[1:50:19] God, listen to me. God will never change
[1:50:23] his mind about that office.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; You young people, you were born from the
[1:50:29] womb of your mother because God knew
[1:50:31] that before the foundation of the world.
[1:50:34] And that mother can never change that.
[1:50:36] And she is in that office. that father,
[1:50:39] the seed come from father. And that and
[1:50:42] that is and and if I could convey to
[1:50:45] you, you that have children that are not
[1:50:48] born again, you have a holy right before
[1:50:52] God, God Almighty, you gave me those
[1:50:56] children, predestination or no
[1:50:59] predestination, I believe it all. I
[1:51:01] believe everything this prophet said,
[1:51:03] but I also believe what he said. Ask
[1:51:06] what you will.
[1:51:09] and it shall be done.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching today.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not something for 2,000
[1:51:16] years ago or 2,000 years hence, but for
[1:51:18] today now you can anchor that in your
[1:51:21] heart. I hold that before God. I hold
[1:51:25] that before God. Ask.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; And that's what the scripture was about.
[1:51:29] The man came and asked, you're my
[1:51:31] friend. We're not just Jesus said, "I I
[1:51:35] I now call you friends because I've told
[1:51:38] you everything the father has told me."
[1:51:40] I'll tell you what, friends. We went way
[1:51:43] beyond that in this prophet's in this
[1:51:46] prophet's ministry.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; He was the forerunner
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; and the bridegroom himself
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; veiled himself in that skin
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; to tell you your position with him.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; You are my bride.
[1:52:02] I've elected you. I came and called you.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; This is my voice
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; coming through this messenger. Do you
[1:52:09] accept that folks here?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Do you accept that up in the balcony?
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Do you accept that up here?
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Do you accept that, friends?
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; It was God veiled God veiled in skin
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; to tell us it's wedding time.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; I'm inviting you to a wedding. our
[1:52:30] wedding
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; and we stumbled along and finally we
[1:52:37] wake up and say, "Oh, I'm amazed that he
[1:52:40] loves me." Well, friends, with
[1:52:42] everything that's been said, we should
[1:52:45] have discovered a long time ago that
[1:52:48] he's bringing us into a possession, into
[1:52:50] an office,
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; not just as a bride, but as a wife.
[1:52:57] And the prophet of God goes to Ruth in
[1:52:59] the Old Testament. Ruth who had been a
[1:53:02] who had been whatever she had been a
[1:53:05] boite
[1:53:07] and found herself in the field like you
[1:53:10] have maybe found yourself. You're here
[1:53:12] today. Listen to me. And you find
[1:53:13] yourself in this field of
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Boaz.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; And remember when she was in the field
[1:53:19] of Boaz, she was still picking up little
[1:53:22] just little bits and surviving. Maybe
[1:53:24] that's where you're at today, but that's
[1:53:26] not where he wants you. He wants you to
[1:53:29] realize he's the mighty man of wealth.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; He wants you to realize that's his
[1:53:34] field.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; And he set his eyes on you.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; And he spoke to his servant said, "Who
[1:53:39] is this woman?
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; And she's the maiden.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; She's the Moabitete. She wasn't born
[1:53:46] right. Neither were you.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; We're not born right. We didn't come
[1:53:50] into this world maybe the right way,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; but he's here
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; to give you a new birth.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; He's here to buy you
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; and you'll be his.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; And then she wasn't interested
[1:54:08] in just getting some gifts.
[1:54:13] I'm talking about receiving him.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Give me a few more minutes. Once you
[1:54:18] receive him, if anybody receives their
[1:54:21] husband and is only interested in what
[1:54:23] he can give her, it's not in for a good,
[1:54:26] it's in for a rocky relationship.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; We're not in for what we can get out of
[1:54:32] this marriage.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; And get, you know, get something to, you
[1:54:36] know, tickle ourselves with. She got him
[1:54:39] the person.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; She received him the person.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. Don't just
[1:54:46] receive a message. received a person
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; He's in the message.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; The message is what he's
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; is the message he's conveying to us.
[1:54:57] He's talking about Am I making it clear?
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Am I making it clear?
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; He's a person.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Every once in a while there's books that
[1:55:09] are written and the author becomes a
[1:55:11] great person and then they'll put an ad
[1:55:13] in the paper and people who have read
[1:55:15] the book, oh, I've just read that book.
[1:55:16] I'm so excited about that book.
[1:55:21] And they say, "Well, the author's going
[1:55:22] to be downtown in a bookstore." They'll
[1:55:24] be at Chapters or uh Nobles bookstore
[1:55:28] and and they'll be be down there and and
[1:55:31] signing and people flock up there and
[1:55:34] line up because they want to meet the
[1:55:36] author.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're the person
[1:55:40] you're the person that this is written
[1:55:42] about. This is your story. and they sign
[1:55:46] it.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Well, I Jesus
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; have sent mine angel.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I Jesus
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; have written this book.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; I Jesus,
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; he is the He is the husband.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's taking you on a
[1:56:01] honeymoon. Listen friends, this isn't
[1:56:03] some pie in the sky. This is reality.
[1:56:07] You're sitting in a pew today, but
[1:56:08] you're going to sit on a chair
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; in a bride's in a supper, a wedding
[1:56:14] supper. You're going to sit there.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; You're going to sit beside another one.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Might be one you're sitting beside now
[1:56:21] or might be someone different, but they
[1:56:23] will be bloodbought.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Came into this world for one purpose,
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; to be a son of God or a daughter of God.
[1:56:35] Hallelujah.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Some of you don't have uh Christian
[1:56:42] parents. Some of you have Christian
[1:56:44] parents. That's not an accident if
[1:56:46] you're born in a Christian home. That
[1:56:48] was ordained by God
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; to make you a family unit like that.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; That's a special unit.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Special offices,
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; honorable, wonderful.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; And maybe you didn't have that. Maybe
[1:57:04] you, you know, had a different kind of a
[1:57:06] background.
[1:57:09] I don't care what background you have.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the background is. God
[1:57:15] ordained
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; and sent this word.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't heard it before,
[1:57:20] you're hearing it this morning.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; This is God's This is God's call
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; to this people. I feel very much urged
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; I feel very much commissioned
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; of God to say certain things
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; and I even wondered as I was uh studying
[1:57:37] and giving myself to it. This
[1:57:38] congregation needs to receive this at a
[1:57:41] different level.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Not down here. We're not just a group of
[1:57:44] people to fellowship. That's not what
[1:57:46] it's about. We're not here just to
[1:57:48] fellowship. We're here because each of
[1:57:50] us have received the bridegroom.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; We've received him as our husband.
[1:57:58] And nothing can change that
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; ever.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you understand it.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; You that are Americans, do you
[1:58:06] understand everything that's happening
[1:58:07] in the White House right now? Do you
[1:58:09] understand everything about the national
[1:58:11] debt? Do you understand everything about
[1:58:13] the gold reserve or the or the Fed the
[1:58:15] Feds? Do you understand that? No, you
[1:58:17] don't understand it. But you're still
[1:58:19] Americans,
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; are you not?
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That wasn't a very strong
[1:58:26] name. Amen. How many Americans have we
[1:58:28] got? Oh my goodness. Half the
[1:58:31] congregation.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Do you understand everything was in
[1:58:35] happening in the in the White House? Do
[1:58:36] you understand it all? Do you understand
[1:58:38] perhaps the laws and all the
[1:58:40] negotiations going on right now? Raise
[1:58:42] your hands. You understand it all. Thank
[1:58:44] you. We got one. He's a hero.
[1:58:47] Brother Jim Weber. He understands it.
[1:58:50] Well, I'll tell you what, I understand
[1:58:52] quite a bit of it. even being a
[1:58:53] Canadian. And I understand it cuz a cuz
[1:58:56] a prophet came along told me they were
[1:58:57] broke.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; About 50 years ago told me they were
[1:59:03] broke.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; And you that are grandchildren, you that
[1:59:07] were just babies years and years ago, he
[1:59:09] he said that you're going to be paying
[1:59:11] off your grandparents debt.
[1:59:14] Amen.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; All you need to do is get about 14 plus
[1:59:18] trillion dollars and divide it by 330
[1:59:21] million and you find out how much each
[1:59:23] of you owe.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know what happened in Canada? I
[1:59:29] don't know what happened. I don't even
[1:59:30] know the laws they passed last week.
[1:59:33] They passed laws. I don't know what they
[1:59:35] are. Does that change my position? No.
[1:59:37] I'm still a Canadian.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Proud of it or sad about it or whatever.
[1:59:43] You're still you are what you are.
[1:59:45] You're German, you're French, you're
[1:59:46] Russian, you're something else, you're
[1:59:49] Ukrainian,
[1:59:53] African, whatever it is, God knew that
[1:59:56] before the before time began.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; He saw you coming.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; And what you have to settle in your
[2:00:02] heart, God had me coming here cuz he
[2:00:05] want me exactly as I am
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; and I'm here for his glory.
[2:00:12] Hallelujah.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; And when you respect that, and listen,
[2:00:17] this is probably a final one. I've got
[2:00:19] to close, but I I could go on for, you
[2:00:22] know, another hour or two. I got so much
[2:00:25] on my plate.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; But one of the people you have to
[2:00:28] respect is yourself.
[2:00:31] Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; You have to respect the fact that God
[2:00:34] called you,
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; that God thought enough of you to hunt
[2:00:37] you down
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; to find you where you were
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; and then to send his spirit to you
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; and begin to move over you
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; and begin to break you down until you
[2:00:51] said yes
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; and begin to illuminate your mind till
[2:00:55] it was a revelation.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; And you have to respect that. Amen.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; You know, one of the hardest things I
[2:01:03] have to have respect. Yesterday
[2:01:05] afternoon, yesterday all day, beautiful
[2:01:07] day. I had to respect the office
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; of a minister, a minister's
[2:01:13] responsibility. Sit at your desk.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Wait on God.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Read these scriptures. See what God's
[2:01:21] messenger said. See what my prophet
[2:01:24] said. Hear what he said. Tell the people
[2:01:27] what he said. That's my responsibility
[2:01:30] and I have to respect that.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; You have to respect that you're a
[2:01:35] mother, a father or a young person. You
[2:01:37] have to respect that. What is my duties?
[2:01:40] What is my responsibilities? And I
[2:01:42] touched on it last week. And as
[2:01:44] husbands, as fathers, we have a
[2:01:46] responsibility to be godly,
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; to give an example,
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; to show the children, show the family
[2:01:53] spiritual leadership.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Integrity.
[2:01:57] Oh God, just give us more of that.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful when I see these godly
[2:02:05] families that have been raised up by the
[2:02:07] message, cultivated by the message. What
[2:02:10] a blessing it is.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; What a blessing to have people come
[2:02:13] around here at this construction and see
[2:02:16] the young people working and see the
[2:02:18] fathers and see the sisters working and
[2:02:20] you young ladies are working, sanding
[2:02:23] the walls and whatever more. You think
[2:02:25] you're sanding the walls. God speaking
[2:02:27] to somebody
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; and they come and hear old rough
[2:02:30] construction men say, "Where in the
[2:02:32] world do you get like young ladies like
[2:02:34] that? Where do you get young men like
[2:02:36] that?"
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Because they're cultivated
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; by the word and the message of the hour.
[2:02:42] And I respect that message.
[2:02:57] He said, "It's your approach
[2:03:00] to a divine gift."
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; What brings the results?
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; It's the way you come to it.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; He said another place in perseverance,
[2:03:12] and I'm closing quickly.
[2:03:14] Martha, when she went to meet Jesus,
[2:03:17] if there was anyone that had a right to
[2:03:19] condemn,
[2:03:21] it would have been Martha.
[2:03:24] because she had sent for Jesus to come
[2:03:26] and pray for her brother. She'd come to
[2:03:29] him in a dark hour.
[2:03:32] Come,
[2:03:35] I need a loaf of bread. I need a
[2:03:37] healing.
[2:03:39] My brother is sick unto death.
[2:03:48] They'd left the church.
[2:03:50] They'd come out of the old dead movement
[2:03:52] that they were in and had followed the
[2:03:55] Lord Jesus believing him to be the
[2:03:57] anointed Messiah.
[2:04:00] And then his very friend
[2:04:03] Lazarus
[2:04:05] that he come up that he come up with and
[2:04:09] they'd been excommunicated from their
[2:04:11] church.
[2:04:13] Did didn't just leave a church or leave
[2:04:15] a denomination. They'd been put out,
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; cast out.
[2:04:21] You're not welcome here.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; They've gone through that.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; And now was the hour at midnight. I need
[2:04:30] you.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; It's desperate. Your friend is sick.
[2:04:35] Talking about approach, friends.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; And when you go out these doors, if
[2:04:40] you're going to really receive him,
[2:04:41] appropriate this word.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; In other words, put it into practice.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:54] and his very friend that he came up with
[2:04:57] was laying sick at the point of death
[2:05:00] and the doctor could do him no good. And
[2:05:03] she sent for Jesus and Jesus simply
[2:05:06] ignored her sending
[2:05:08] and he went to another city and he did
[2:05:12] the same thing there and they sent again
[2:05:14] and he just ignored it and went on. But
[2:05:17] she ran up to him when he came. She ran
[2:05:20] up to him and she had a right to upgrade
[2:05:23] him. She had a right to tell him saying,
[2:05:25] "Now, why didn't you come when I called
[2:05:29] you?" And when she got to him,
[2:05:36] she approached him in the right way
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; and she said
[2:05:43] she give him his title.
[2:05:46] Hallelujah.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; She recognized his office.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; There was people who came around,
[2:05:59] brother said, "Prophet, prophet, prophet
[2:06:01] this, prophet that, prophet that." They
[2:06:03] hadn't received him
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; as a prophet of God.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; But there are other people. And she came
[2:06:10] and she said, "Lord,
[2:06:14] not upgrade him, but Lord,
[2:06:17] if thou would have been here, my brother
[2:06:18] would not have died. Oh my, I can see
[2:06:21] him pull up his little tired body
[2:06:23] together."
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; If you'd have been here, my brother
[2:06:27] would not have died. But even now,
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; whatever you ask God,
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; God will give it to you.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you don't know what that did
[2:06:39] to me when I was reading that. What a
[2:06:40] responsibility it puts.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with a child or a
[2:06:46] young person
[2:06:48] going to their parent said, "Father,
[2:06:52] not old man, not just dad."
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with saying, "Dad,
[2:06:57] father,
[2:06:59] you're my father. You're my dad."
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; You know God in a different way than I
[2:07:05] do.
[2:07:08] I'm a child
[2:07:10] and the Bible says foolishness is bound
[2:07:13] in the heart of a child. I've done a lot
[2:07:14] of foolish things, but I need this God
[2:07:19] that you have lived in front of me. I
[2:07:22] need this God that you've talked about.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; I remember one time when Leah, who's
[2:07:30] here listening,
[2:07:32] sitting back here now, she has four
[2:07:34] children.
[2:07:37] and they had a carpenter
[2:07:40] remodeling in their house
[2:07:44] and she was standing on little store
[2:07:46] steps and with her hands and she was
[2:07:49] just looking through the railing.
[2:07:52] So when the workman come up, this
[2:07:54] carpenter come up, they were just eye to
[2:07:56] eye
[2:07:59] and he says, "Where's your dad?"
[2:08:03] And she just staring absolute blank
[2:08:06] face. He's talking to Jesus.
[2:08:10] I guarantee that carpenter never heard
[2:08:13] that before.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; And he was stunned into silence. To have
[2:08:18] a child, just a young girl, stare him
[2:08:21] right in the face that say he's talking
[2:08:23] to Jesus.
[2:08:25] That's something kids remember.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:38] when my daughter Joanne, who's here,
[2:08:43] was going through her struggles as a
[2:08:45] teenager.
[2:08:48] And it wasn't struggles with the world.
[2:08:50] It was just little things of character.
[2:08:54] People have certain strengths.
[2:08:58] and I sat her down in my study
[2:09:02] in a chair.
[2:09:04] That chair is in my office
[2:09:07] and I won't let anybody recover it
[2:09:10] because that's where she sat when she
[2:09:12] was 15.
[2:09:19] And I said,
[2:09:22] Joanne,
[2:09:24] that's where daddy nails
[2:09:28] and that's where God talks to him.
[2:09:34] And I said,
[2:09:36] you need God to do something for you.
[2:09:43] And she started to break down, which she
[2:09:46] was standing very, very rigid.
[2:09:49] But the Holy Spirit, I just sense, not
[2:09:51] because she was, she didn't weep, she
[2:09:53] just started to break down. She was
[2:09:55] resisting it a bit, trying to maintain
[2:09:57] her composure.
[2:10:01] And she said, "I've tried.
[2:10:04] I've tried.
[2:10:09] I've tried and it doesn't work for her."
[2:10:14] And I said,
[2:10:18] Well, I'm going to pray for you.
[2:10:22] And the next Sunday, I believe it was,
[2:10:24] and that's the only only message that's
[2:10:26] ever been printed that I know of that I
[2:10:28] spoke.
[2:10:30] And it was sinners die alone.
[2:10:33] And God laid that on my heart. We're
[2:10:36] just in the house down here. Maybe 40,
[2:10:39] 50, 60 people crowded in the house.
[2:10:43] When I'm getting to the end of that
[2:10:44] service, sinners die alone. And I spoke
[2:10:47] on the on the beggar at at the gate of
[2:10:50] the rich man. And the rich man died.
[2:10:56] Lazarus died and the angels were there
[2:10:58] and bore him up into the bosom of
[2:11:00] Abraham.
[2:11:02] But the rich man died. There was no
[2:11:04] angels. There was nobody to receive him.
[2:11:07] And I got the message, sinners die
[2:11:09] alone. And I was just in the ending of
[2:11:11] that message and I was weeping and
[2:11:13] sobbing while I was preaching and I
[2:11:15] cried out and I said, "Joanne, it's you.
[2:11:22] I'm talking about a God that works.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a God that speaks."
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; And she came and knelt a chair right
[2:11:31] then and that's been it.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; That's been it. That's the way it's
[2:11:36] supposed to be, friends.
[2:11:38] Yes,
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; we'd love to have things perhaps
[2:11:40] different in other situations, but if we
[2:11:43] can get a revelation
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; of what you are
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; and you need to have the respect from
[2:11:49] almighty God of your own position and
[2:11:52] what you are
[2:11:54] and your you that are have husbands and
[2:11:57] wives to believe and accept them in the
[2:12:01] light of the scripture as they are. I
[2:12:04] guarantee you your homes will be
[2:12:06] different. Your relationships will be
[2:12:09] different. This church will be
[2:12:11] different. And we will be what we're
[2:12:13] supposed to be. Friends, you're going to
[2:12:15] cross over. I'm going to cross over.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Listen to me.
[2:12:20] I come over here and speak to you, young
[2:12:22] man. I remember so well. It's just gone
[2:12:24] by like that.
[2:12:26] I remember being exact. I remember
[2:12:28] standing and sitting and listening to
[2:12:30] ministers preach. It's not going to be
[2:12:33] any time at all. And you're going to be
[2:12:35] on the other side. We're going to be
[2:12:36] sitting here right together. You'll be
[2:12:39] who you are and I'll be who I am. Death
[2:12:42] changes nothing.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? Death changes
[2:12:45] nothing. You say, "Well, this is a
[2:12:47] different kind of a service." It
[2:12:48] certainly is a different kind of a
[2:12:50] service. We're not here just to have
[2:12:51] church. We're here to get ready to cross
[2:12:53] over.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; And I need to do absolutely everything I
[2:12:58] can
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; in this life.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; Whether we live a year or 10 years or 50
[2:13:04] years, that has nothing to do with it. I
[2:13:06] that's irrelevant to me. But let us live
[2:13:08] it according to the word of God in the
[2:13:10] place that God has given. I say God
[2:13:12] bless you.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Young men, young ladies, God bless you,
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; fathers, mothers. God bless you.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; And God honor you. God will honor you.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; And let's make sure our approach now is
[2:13:29] a godly approach.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:41] like to have brother Derek come and help
[2:13:44] me with the song if he would please.
[2:13:55] Now just give me your attention.
[2:14:02] Brother Brandham said these phrases
[2:14:05] when he had people. They were there to
[2:14:07] get something.
[2:14:09] They were there to get a loaf. They were
[2:14:11] in their dark hour.
[2:14:13] But this is what he said.
[2:14:15] Do you believe me to be God's prophet?
[2:14:18] Said it 93 times. Do you believe me to
[2:14:22] be his servant? 102 times. Do you
[2:14:26] believe me to be do you believe me to be
[2:14:29] his
[2:14:31] uh you believe me to be his prophet? You
[2:14:34] believe me to be his servant? 113 times.
[2:14:40] Do you believe me to be God's servant?
[2:14:43] Do you believe me? Do you believe that I
[2:14:46] am his servant?
[2:14:48] And there's several hundred times. Why
[2:14:51] would he say that?
[2:14:52] Number one, he's having to have respect
[2:14:55] to his office.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; I am God's prophet.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; I am God's servant. I am his prophet. I
[2:15:02] am his servant. However he wanted to say
[2:15:04] it. And he had to say it to them and get
[2:15:06] a commitment from them. I believe that.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; And he told them clearly, if you believe
[2:15:11] that, then I can help you. And I have
[2:15:13] all of those quotes. If you believe
[2:15:14] that, then I can help you. If you don't
[2:15:17] believe it, I can't help you.
[2:15:19] friends, I I'm going to go and talk to
[2:15:21] Brother Ed. Forget it.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; It won't work.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I went and talked to Brother
[2:15:28] Ed. I went and talked to Brother Tom. I
[2:15:30] went and talked to Brother John. I went
[2:15:31] and talked to I I I I talked to my
[2:15:33] husband. I I I talked We talked it
[2:15:36] over." Did you?
[2:15:38] That's great. What was your approach
[2:15:41] like?
[2:15:48] said, "Brother Ed, we didn't expect to
[2:15:50] be squeezed down like this."
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; I'm putting the screws to it. This has
[2:15:55] to This has to change.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Don't ever come to me as Brother Ed.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; You need to find out what office
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; it is.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Approach the office.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; If I'm a janitor, then approach me as a
[2:16:12] janitor. I'll be I'll be honored. If I'm
[2:16:15] a servant of God, then approach me as a
[2:16:17] servant of God. If I'm your pastor,
[2:16:20] approach it as that. Whatever. Here's a
[2:16:22] man of God. He's a bearer of the word of
[2:16:25] God, the Holy Spirit. He gives himself
[2:16:27] to the Holy Spirit. What kind of honor?
[2:16:29] You know what the scripture says? Double
[2:16:31] honor.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:38] I've seen it in my own family and I
[2:16:40] don't want to raise that as an example
[2:16:42] but that's the only example I've known.
[2:16:45] I've told you here this I' I've told you
[2:16:47] here but sometime we come here for
[2:16:49] healing sometimes it goes in one ear and
[2:16:51] out the other. I don't want it to go in
[2:16:52] one ear and out the other.
[2:16:56] My my wife had an affliction come back
[2:16:58] on her which was a dangerous affliction
[2:17:00] and a gynecologist said to her if you
[2:17:02] ever have this come back on you you
[2:17:05] contact me immediately
[2:17:09] and she was good for about 15 years
[2:17:12] right here while we had this church.
[2:17:15] We were just getting ready to leave to
[2:17:16] go to Tacoma
[2:17:19] and she had her hand on the door knob
[2:17:23] just to open the door and she took her
[2:17:26] hand off the knob and she turned and she
[2:17:27] said, "Honey, that thing has come back
[2:17:31] on me that I had in Victoria."
[2:17:34] I said, "When did it happen?" She said,
[2:17:36] "About 3 weeks ago. And I want you to
[2:17:39] get the bottle of oil." And we always
[2:17:41] had the oil on the window sill. I want
[2:17:44] you to get the bottle of oil and anoint
[2:17:46] me with oil. She wasn't coming to Oh,
[2:17:50] honey or hubby or whatever more. She was
[2:17:52] coming to the office.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; I want you to take the bottle of oil and
[2:17:57] I want you to anoint me with oil. And I
[2:18:00] said, "Yes." We walked back into the
[2:18:02] kitchen.
[2:18:04] I took two chairs out. She knelt at the
[2:18:06] chair. I anointed with oil in the name
[2:18:09] of the Lord. And before we got back to
[2:18:13] the door, which was less than five
[2:18:14] minutes, she was completely healed.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Does it work?
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Worksmen
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; every time. If it doesn't work, I say,
[2:18:24] God, you're God.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; If you want us to carry this for a time
[2:18:29] yet, yet you're God.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; And I know one thing, we're going to
[2:18:33] walk on the other side in perfection.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Did the congregation say amen? Let's say
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; He's indeed wonderful.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Let me just pray.
[2:18:55] Father, I do not know
[2:18:59] what all this strange service is to mean
[2:19:02] to the people or to those that are out
[2:19:05] and streaming, but my heart is going out
[2:19:07] to the people in a in a just strange
[2:19:10] way. I don't even know how to express
[2:19:11] it, but you know, oh God, reach into the
[2:19:15] lives and into the hearts.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Perhaps someone is here that is weward.
[2:19:19] Perhaps there's a young
[2:19:22] person, oh God, that needs to take a
[2:19:25] step this morning. And if you are here,
[2:19:28] I'm now speaking to you. I'm
[2:19:30] interrupting the prayer to speak. If you
[2:19:33] are here and God has spoken to you very
[2:19:36] powerfully and you're prepared to come
[2:19:38] with a correct approach, you can stand
[2:19:40] where you are in your seat right now,
[2:19:43] man, woman, whoever you might be, and
[2:19:45] just stand and I will continue to pray.
[2:19:49] Father, these that you have touched or
[2:19:51] spoken to, whether seated or standing in
[2:19:55] whatever place they are. Oh God, we are
[2:19:58] not here filling in time. We're not here
[2:20:01] just to have a lovely service. We're
[2:20:04] here to do battle with the enemy. And we
[2:20:06] pray that you will slay him. We pray
[2:20:09] you'll bring him down and bring him low.
[2:20:11] We pray that you will break, oh God,
[2:20:13] complexes which have held people perhaps
[2:20:16] for years. take and smash those things.
[2:20:19] Oh God, I pray you'll destroy those
[2:20:22] shackles. Oh God, in the name of Jesus
[2:20:25] Christ, I pray, Father, that you'll take
[2:20:28] there's any spirit of disrespect, you'll
[2:20:30] remove it from the people. It'll hold
[2:20:32] them back from your blessings. Oh God,
[2:20:35] in the name of Jesus Christ, may there
[2:20:38] be vows renewed. May there be hearts
[2:20:41] that are made right. Oh father, we know
[2:20:44] that this is not an accidental meeting.
[2:20:47] This is an ordained by almighty God.
[2:20:51] Father, I submit myself to you now and
[2:20:54] present this congregation to you and
[2:20:57] present all those who are streaming.
[2:20:59] Father, just wonderful people. How we
[2:21:02] love them. Oh Lord, I pray you'll do for
[2:21:05] them what is needful. And now, oh God,
[2:21:09] your will be done on earth as it is in
[2:21:12] heaven. In Jesus Christ's name.
[2:21:15] Amen.
[2:21:19] I want to sing.
[2:21:22] I keep listening
[2:21:25] for another sound. You sing with me.
[2:21:31] here.
[2:21:35] See family in the land.
[2:21:39] There's questions in the children's
[2:21:42] eyes. Trouble in the east again.
[2:21:48] The whole world is shaking.
[2:21:52] There's no sure place to stand
[2:21:56] and a mortal sound is heard throughout
[2:22:00] the land.
[2:22:02] Let's just stand together shall we sing.
[2:22:05] I keep listening
[2:22:08] for a different sound.
[2:22:13] Sound of the city that shall bow down.
[2:22:21] Sound of the crowd be united with the
[2:22:27] group.
[2:22:30] I keep listening.
[2:22:34] I keep listening.
[2:22:38] I keep listening for a different
[2:22:47] I remember the preacher saying
[2:22:52] it shall come to pass
[2:22:55] there will come a generation
[2:23:00] that will be the last.
[2:23:03] I can't believe I'm standing here seeing
[2:23:09] the end of time
[2:23:11] and the master
[2:23:15] in my mind
[2:23:19] but I keep listening
[2:23:27] the sound of seeing
[2:23:33] down
[2:23:40] with the
[2:23:44] Jesus.
[2:23:46] I'm listening. I keep listening. I'm
[2:23:50] listening. I keep listening for a
[2:23:55] different
[2:23:58] last words. I remember. I remember the
[2:24:02] preacher saying,
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; you remember today,
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Sunday shall come to pass. There will
[2:24:09] come a generation
[2:24:12] and that will be the last.
[2:24:16] I can't believe I'm standing here.
[2:24:21] in the end of time.
[2:24:24] And the creatures
[2:24:26] and we
[2:24:33] keep listening for different
[2:24:47] Sound of the brightest.
[2:24:59] I
[2:25:02] miss I
[2:25:13] keep listening for
[2:25:29] of brighting
[2:25:32] with the
[2:25:35] I keep listening.
[2:25:39] I keep listening.
[2:25:43] I keep listening for a different
[2:25:52] people. We've heard a different voice
[2:25:53] and we respond to a different sound.
[2:25:57] Friends, there's churches all over this
[2:26:00] whole Pacific Northwest.
[2:26:03] Not many, a few, but not many.
[2:26:08] Hear the voice that you have heard.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; That's what's made such a difference in
[2:26:13] our lives.
[2:26:15] Can ask brother Joe Waldner, you'll
[2:26:18] come. Brother Joe. Brother Joe heard his
[2:26:20] voice in a colony in Manitoba
[2:26:25] and brought his whole family and other
[2:26:28] sons came that are here. These are sons
[2:26:31] of the minister of the colony
[2:26:34] and that their father was reading the
[2:26:36] message books
[2:26:38] for a couple years before he passed
[2:26:40] away. I understand.
[2:26:43] Brother Joseph,
[2:26:45] his wife,
[2:26:47] their children,
[2:26:51] and sister Kathy.
[2:26:54] We sent airline tickets and the colony
[2:26:58] didn't even know that they were gone.
[2:27:00] And I believe her brother went in, drove
[2:27:02] in a car, and they all piled in with
[2:27:05] just shopping bags.
[2:27:07] Left home,
[2:27:10] left furniture,
[2:27:12] left possessions,
[2:27:14] left mother,
[2:27:19] aged mother
[2:27:22] behind,
[2:27:24] couldn't come.
[2:27:26] And that's the that's the decision they
[2:27:28] came to and came here.
[2:27:32] And God has honored
[2:27:35] that decision.
[2:27:37] My brother, my sister, I say to you in
[2:27:38] the name of the Lord, you will never
[2:27:40] regret
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; receiving this word for at the level
[2:27:44] that it is. You'll never regret it.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, brother Roy. Glory to God.
[2:27:50] I'm rejoicing with you. I can feel
[2:27:52] what's in your heart.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; God bless this congregation.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Joe,
[2:28:00] privilege to turn the congregation to
[2:28:02] you for a word of prayer. Amen.
[2:28:07] Bow our heads and our hearts this
[2:28:08] morning. Dear gracious heavenly father,
[2:28:11] how thankful we are that we can come to
[2:28:14] this place that you've provided for us
[2:28:15] to worship you, to praise your wonderful
[2:28:18] name, Father, because you are worthy of
[2:28:20] all praise and honor and glory, Father.
[2:28:23] And we're so thankful, oh God, Father,
[2:28:25] how you have called us with this high
[2:28:27] and holy calling, Father, you've set us
[2:28:30] amongst princes, Father. Oh God, you've
[2:28:32] lifted out of out of the miry clay.
[2:28:34] Father, you lift us out of churches,
[2:28:36] denominations, Father. Oh God, Father,
[2:28:39] and you set us amongst your people,
[2:28:41] Father. And how thankful, Father, we are
[2:28:44] here this morning that we can hear this
[2:28:46] voice, Father, our brothers speaking
[2:28:49] out, Father, the words of life to us,
[2:28:51] Father. Oh God, the words of God,
[2:28:53] Father, how thankful we are, Lord Jesus.
[2:28:56] Father that we have such a uh such a
[2:29:00] brother that that is dedicated to bring
[2:29:03] for to preach forth this gospel father
[2:29:06] in this hour that we're living and
[2:29:07] dedicated to it father and given his
[2:29:09] life to it father. Oh God, Father, Lord,
[2:29:13] how thankful we are, Father, for for
[2:29:15] this ministry that he's put us under.
[2:29:17] Stable, Father. Oh God, we stand as a
[2:29:20] rock, Father, here, Father, where you've
[2:29:22] placed us, Father. Lord, supporting it,
[2:29:25] Father, and we believe in it, Father.
[2:29:28] And Father, we thank you, Father, when
[2:29:29] you hear such messages as we hear this
[2:29:31] morning, Father, we must take heed to
[2:29:34] it, Father, because you're you you've
[2:29:37] given us, you've provided for us,
[2:29:39] Father.
[2:29:40] One thing you'd never do is fail us,
[2:29:42] Father. Oh God, as David said, I've been
[2:29:44] young and I've been old, and now I've
[2:29:46] never seen the righteous forsaken or
[2:29:48] receive begging bread, Father. And not
[2:29:50] all together natural bread, but
[2:29:52] spiritual bread. We've been wellfed
[2:29:54] here, Father. And we thank you this
[2:29:56] morning for the bread that you have
[2:29:57] given us, this daily bread, Father.
[2:30:00] Lord, it's your word, Father, and we
[2:30:02] believe it. Let us all take it to heart,
[2:30:04] Father. Bless your people, Father.
[2:30:07] Strengthen them, Father. Oh, God.
[2:30:08] encourage them, Father, in the word,
[2:30:10] Lord God, continually, Father. May not
[2:30:13] be only what they hear, hear, Father,
[2:30:15] but what they take with, Father, the the
[2:30:17] the direction, Father, and the
[2:30:19] leadership and the guidance, Father, and
[2:30:21] them and the words that were spoken,
[2:30:23] Father, to apply it to the to our lives,
[2:30:25] Father, and to hear it over and over
[2:30:27] again in our quiet time, in our home,
[2:30:29] and practice it, Father, and just live
[2:30:32] it, Father. That's the main thing, to
[2:30:33] live it, Father. Not just to come here
[2:30:35] and hear it, but to live it, Father. And
[2:30:37] father, I believe it works. Father, we
[2:30:39] thank you, Father, for Brother Ed and
[2:30:41] the ministry. Father, we ask that you go
[2:30:44] before us this day. That you'll bless
[2:30:46] each and every one, Father, and
[2:30:48] strengthen them, Father. And he asking
[2:30:51] give you thanks in your wonderful name,
[2:30:53] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you,
[2:30:56] Lord. Hallelujah.

[2:31:17] prayer service. I've been so been never
[2:31:21] been so encouraged as I've been with the
[2:31:23] prayer services and the number of people
[2:31:25] coming two and three times and I
[2:31:27] encourage you to come and pray for the
[2:31:29] services. I feel the strength. I thought
[2:31:31] of it yesterday. the people have prayed
[2:31:33] and I've heard how they pray and I I've
[2:31:36] been more just really feeling pressed.
[2:31:38] Every time I miss it, I just really miss
[2:31:41] the service. And so I I'm saying God
[2:31:44] bless you and God with you and and have
[2:31:47] a wonderful afternoon. And those that
[2:31:50] are down in Seattle, remember us in
[2:31:52] prayer as well, would you please? And as
