[10:48] Lord Jesus, we love you this morning.
[10:51] Lord, we lift up our voices in praise
[10:54] unto thee, oh Lord. Oh Jesus, you are
[10:59] worthy, Lord. And we lift up your name,
[11:01] Lord. We bless your name, oh Lord. Thank
[11:05] you, Lord Jesus.
[11:07] Thank you for coming to us, Lord, when
[11:09] we could not come to you, Lord. You
[11:12] became us that might become you, Lord.
[11:15] Oh, we bless your name, Father. Thank
[11:18] you for the great plan of redemption,
[11:20] Lord. Work in our lives, Lord. Work
[11:23] through our lives, Jesus. Have your way
[11:26] this morning, Lord. Oh, be pleased with
[11:29] our worship, Father. Receive it, Lord,
[11:32] and come down in our midst, Father. We
[11:36] bless your name this morning, God.
[11:39] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord

[11:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord,
[11:47] what a wonderful savior,
[11:50] blessed redeemer.
[11:53] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[11:55] I'm going to ask brother Jean Manassie
[11:57] to come and lead us to the throne of
[11:59] grace.
[12:01] If we could just
[12:03] play that song, Jesus paid it all.
[12:09] We haven't got any prayer requests
[12:11] written in, but I know we have many
[12:13] needs. And we just also want to remember
[12:16] uh Happy Valley Church this morning. And
[12:20] the memorial service for our brother
[12:23] Kenneth Y is taking place today, I
[12:25] believe this afternoon.
[12:28] Just remember the bride around the
[12:30] world. Amen.
[12:33] Jesus
[12:34] paid it all.
[12:38] All to him
[12:43] sing.
[12:55] I hear the Savior say
[13:00] my strength
[13:04] child
[13:07] and gra
[13:22] I
[13:25] sing and praise and sing.
[13:35] Just want to ask the need to come
[13:37] forward. Our brother John Manassie to
[13:40] sing that chorus once more.
[13:43] Jesus
[13:45] made it all
[13:50] by
[13:53] sing.
[14:04] Let's pray it.
[14:06] Heavenly Father, we come into your
[14:08] presence this morning, Lord Jesus
[14:09] Christ, with an expectation in our
[14:11] hearts. Lord, our hearts are rejoicing,
[14:13] Father, to be in the house of God. Lord,
[14:16] where we know we're not going to hear
[14:17] from a man, but we're going to hear from
[14:18] Almighty God. Father, the instructions
[14:21] that we need, Father, to get closer to
[14:22] that change in the body, the
[14:24] instructions we need to get closer to
[14:25] that rapturing faith, Lord Jesus. I've
[14:28] come this morning expecting, Lord God,
[14:30] in my heart, Lord Jesus, this is a great
[14:32] desire for you, Father. This is a
[14:33] greater love for you, oh God, this
[14:35] morning, oh Jesus. I'm so grateful for
[14:37] all that you've done for us this year
[14:38] already, Father. and you're taking your
[14:40] church higher, oh God. Our desire is
[14:42] that you take us to higher grounds, oh
[14:44] Father, that will be so lost into your
[14:45] love, oh God. So love, so lost in the
[14:48] depths of your love, Father Jesus. I
[14:50] pray, oh God, that you lift up the
[14:51] congregation, oh Lord Jesus, in the
[14:53] atmosphere that we that require you,
[14:55] Father, to bring forth your word, Lord.
[14:57] As a prophet say, it's the atmosphere
[14:59] that produces the result, Father. And I
[15:01] pray that our praise and worship,
[15:02] Father, will be pleasing to you, oh God.
[15:04] That you'll bless the offerings this
[15:06] morning, Father. Any person here who has
[15:08] a request in his heart, Lord God, you
[15:11] know our hearts, Father. The word of God
[15:12] is a discerner, Lord Jesus. We don't
[15:14] need to write it down necessarily, but
[15:16] God, we know that your word, Lord God,
[15:17] can go and directly meet our needs this
[15:20] morning. Father, if there's needs,
[15:21] Father, for healing in the body, Lord
[15:23] God, we believe, Father, that you died
[15:25] for our sins, that you die for our
[15:26] healing, Lord Jesus. We come believing
[15:29] for our loved ones, oh Father, they
[15:30] don't know you yet, Lord God. for the
[15:32] backsliders, Lord Jesus Christ. I pray,
[15:34] oh father, this morning, Lord God, by
[15:36] the preaching of the word that you
[15:37] inspire faith in our hearts to claim
[15:39] them, Lord Jesus, for the fathers and
[15:41] mothers, praying for the daughters and
[15:42] sons, oh Lord God, that we apply the
[15:44] token this morning with our prayer and
[15:46] we'll claim Lord Jesus Christ. For
[15:48] ourselves, oh God, needing, Father, a
[15:50] greater walk with you, needing a greater
[15:53] baptism, Father, I pray that you just
[15:54] baptize each five bird of our body with
[15:56] the Holy Spirit. Oh God, that will walk
[15:59] out of this place a different people. Oh
[16:00] Jesus, you're a consecrated people. Oh
[16:03] Jesus, we want this morning to be a
[16:05] special meeting. Lord God, not because
[16:07] they were a special people necessarily,
[16:08] but because you're a special God in
[16:10] midst of his people this morning, oh
[16:12] God. Lord God, wonder God came down in
[16:14] the mountain. Father, the prophet said
[16:15] the mountain became holy, not because of
[16:17] the mountain, but because of holy God.
[16:20] Lord, let this congregation be holy
[16:21] because the Holy God is in our midst
[16:23] this morning, oh Father. And because
[16:24] you're in our midst, all things are
[16:26] possible, Lord Jesus. We believe, oh
[16:28] God. We believe for the impossible this
[16:30] morning. Thank you, Father, as we sing
[16:33] it, Lord. It's already done, Lord God.
[16:35] It is well with my soul. It's our
[16:36] confession this morning. You're the high
[16:38] priest of our confession, Lord. We put
[16:40] it upon our lips, Lord God. It all is
[16:42] well. And we thank you for the things
[16:44] that you've grown us already, Lord, for
[16:46] you hear us when we pray. Thank you Lord
[16:48] for all things that you have done in our
[16:50] lives. May you bless the musician Lord.
[16:52] Bless the song service in the name of
[16:54] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[16:57] Amen. Thank you brother. We have your
[16:59] seat.
[17:02] Just going to ask brother Peta to get
[17:05] ready for his special. And let's just
[17:08] sing that song. It was a great thing
[17:10] that he did for me.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[19:05] I have a back pain really bad. I have to
[19:08] eat my dinner on my stomach. That's how
[19:11] bad it is. So, um, Sunday before I think
[19:15] brother Tim came back from South Africa,
[19:18] I asked the Lord what you do for that
[19:21] sister, you can do it for me.
[19:25] So, I said I go to bed. I prayed as Lord
[19:29] when I woke up in the morning, I want to
[19:32] go to work. I woke up in the morning
[19:36] 100%
[19:39] So I just want to thank the Lord today.
[19:58] I'm nervous. It's been a while.
[20:12] While the world looks upon me as I
[20:17] struggle along,
[20:20] they say I have nothing.
[20:24] But they are so wrong.
[20:28] In my heart I'm rejoicing.
[20:32] How I wish they could see.
[20:36] Thank you, Lord,
[20:39] for your blessing on me.

[20:50] good place to sleep.

[24:18] song in the Fiji style.
[24:23] Let's just sing. I just want to thank
[24:24] you, Lord, for letting me hear your
[24:26] word. I'm going to ask our brother
[24:28] Biscll to come and and uh the baby
[24:31] dedication, the young family to get
[24:34] ready.
[24:36] And I just want to thank you Lord
[24:41] for the
[24:44] word
[24:47] I
[24:50] glor. Heat. Heat.
[25:00] Heat. Heat.
[25:14] You open my eyes.
[25:39] Heat. Heat.
[25:49] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[25:59] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[26:09] Heat. Heat.
[26:20] Hey
[26:25] my free
[26:45] God is
[26:49] Heat. Heat.
[27:00] Thank you
[27:02] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[27:16] Lord,
[27:27] oh Lord, I thank you.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:35] Well, we have brother Ryan and his wife,
[27:38] Sister Elaine, up here. Brother, brother
[27:39] Ryan is not in his usual official
[27:43] position leading the song service or
[27:46] playing the piano or singing a special
[27:47] or leading the choir, but he's in a very
[27:50] official position. He's a daddy.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; And Sister Ya is a mama.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; And that's a God-given position. So, I
[28:03] had a few things to say and uh I hope
[28:08] there's other members of the family.
[28:09] They'll probably either be streaming or
[28:12] and if you're streaming, we say God
[28:13] bless you.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; If you're here present, God bless you.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; And uh
[28:22] I'm asking that may the word of God
[28:27] &gt;&gt; hover over this sun that we're going to
[28:29] dedicate.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:31] uh to perform
[28:34] your desire. And I say that to you,
[28:37] brother Ryan and Sister Elena. You have
[28:40] desires toward your children and to this
[28:43] son that you want to dedicate.
[28:46] And I just felt that to say to you that
[28:50] may the Holy Spirit hover over this boy
[28:53] to perform your desires for him.
[28:58] They have named this child Josiah
[29:03] James
[29:05] Hayes.
[29:07] And Josiah, as soon as you mentioned
[29:09] that, Brother Ryan, I didn't say
[29:12] anything to you, but it's one of my
[29:15] favorite
[29:16] persons in the Bible.
[29:19] So, this this is easy.
[29:22] I can speak from my heart.
[29:25] And uh but I don't know if you realized
[29:28] you have one name from the Old Testament
[29:31] and one from the New.
[29:37] My favorite uh scripture
[29:41] concerning Josiah,
[29:43] God said this,
[29:46] "Because thine heart was tender,
[29:49] and thou hast humbled thyself before the
[29:52] Lord, when thou heardest what I spake
[29:56] against this place, and against the
[29:59] inhabitants thereof,
[30:02] that they should become a desolation and
[30:05] a curse, and hast rent thy clothes and
[30:08] wept before me, I also have heard thee,
[30:13] sayeth the Lord. And I just pray that
[30:16] the God who spoke that
[30:18] will be near this boy all of his days.
[30:25] The second name that you've chose is
[30:27] James.
[30:29] And I want to say I want to speak to the
[30:32] congregation and to
[30:35] Ryan James and sister Elena
[30:38] together.
[30:40] James was a brother of John,
[30:44] one of the first disciples called by
[30:46] Jesus
[30:48] to follow him.
[30:51] James left all and followed him.
[30:56] James was with Jesus on the mount of
[30:58] transfiguration.
[31:01] James was there when Jesus said, "Who
[31:04] touched me?"
[31:06] And the ruler of the synagogue was also
[31:09] there and stood nearby because he was
[31:11] bes he wanted to beseech the Lord for
[31:14] his 12-year-old daughter that was dead
[31:16] dreadfully sick.
[31:19] And the Bible says
[31:22] that the ruler of the synagogue while he
[31:25] was standing there his servants came and
[31:27] said don't trouble the master.
[31:30] James is standing there all this time.
[31:31] Don't trouble the master. Your daughter
[31:34] has died.
[31:36] And Jesus
[31:38] took his disciples only. He suffered no
[31:42] man to follow him save Peter and James
[31:47] and John.
[31:50] James was there when the great draft
[31:53] draft of fishes were caught and saw
[31:57] Peter fall at the knees of Jesus and say
[31:59] depart from me for I am a sinful man.
[32:03] And the Bible says that they left all.
[32:06] They forsook all and followed him.
[32:10] James was one of those.
[32:14] James
[32:16] uh Jesus took Peter, James and John with
[32:20] him into Gethsemane.
[32:24] James is the first apostle to be
[32:26] martyed.
[32:28] So I want to say to this couple today,
[32:33] Josiah is a wonderful name of the Old
[32:37] Testament, one of the one of the admired
[32:40] and kings that found his way to the
[32:42] heart of God.
[32:44] And James
[32:46] found his way to the heart of Jesus.
[32:50] He was always with him.
[32:52] And so you don't That's wonderful.
[32:59] James
[33:01] Josiah, you're a wonderful boy.
[33:04] I asked Brother Ryan, does he have a
[33:07] quiet spirit? Because I'm going to take
[33:10] a few moments
[33:16] And it's James in the New Testament that
[33:18] has said the prayer of faith
[33:21] shall save the sick
[33:24] and the Lord shall raise him up and if
[33:27] he have committed any sin they shall be
[33:30] forgiven him.
[33:36] The Bible says that when Simon Peter saw
[33:39] it and fell down at Jesus' knees,
[33:41] saying, "Depart from me, for I'm a
[33:42] sinful man, oh Lord." And he was
[33:45] astonished and all that were with him at
[33:49] all the fishes that they caught. And
[33:51] they fell down at his knees. And so also
[33:55] was James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
[33:57] also called the sons of thunder.
[34:02] But there was something that was unusual
[34:04] and you had said this to me, Brother
[34:06] Ryan, in your email.
[34:10] We wrestled, we being brother Ryan and
[34:13] Sister Ulena, we wrestled with what to
[34:17] name him for some time and didn't really
[34:21] lean toward Josiah until a few weeks
[34:23] before his birth.
[34:28] Brother D Ryan said, "I began to read on
[34:30] Josiah in the scriptures, and that's
[34:33] wonderful.
[34:35] And it was when I read 2 Kings 23:25
[34:39] that I began to really feel it was the
[34:42] name he was supposed to have."
[34:46] And I'll say to you that are getting
[34:48] married or you that are looking for
[34:50] children or when you have children,
[34:53] it's important that you take serious
[34:55] thought of what you call a child.
[35:00] And like unto him, there was no king
[35:02] before him that turned to the Lord with
[35:06] all of his heart and all his soul. This
[35:09] was in Ryan's email to me. and with all
[35:13] his might, according to all the law of
[35:15] Moses, neither after him arose there any
[35:18] like him. And they've called this boy by
[35:21] that man's name.
[35:24] I think that that speaks well of what's
[35:28] in the heart of this mother and father
[35:31] to call him. And it says an interesting
[35:32] account that we took as confirmation for
[35:36] Josiah's name. The day he was born,
[35:40] I left the hospital. That's Ryan. Left
[35:43] the hospital to get Yolena something to
[35:45] eat as the doctor felt it would be
[35:48] several hours before the baby came. Do
[35:50] you remember that, Elena? You remember
[35:52] that?
[35:54] I guess you wouldn't forget. He said,
[35:55] "While I was away,
[35:58] I received a text from Elena's mother,
[36:01] Sister Mel Medlanka,
[36:04] and she had just heard from her sister,
[36:06] Danka,
[36:09] who was unaware that Elena was currently
[36:12] in the hospital
[36:14] about to deliver Josiah." And Danka had
[36:18] just been reading in the Bible, first
[36:21] Kings
[36:23] 13:1 and2.
[36:26] And behold, there came a man of God out
[36:28] of Judah by the word of the Lord unto
[36:31] Bethl to Gerobam. And Gerobam,
[36:37] so that you probably know, Brother Ryan,
[36:39] Sister Elena, and I want the
[36:41] congregation to know, was a was a king,
[36:43] but he took to be a high priest. He took
[36:46] it upon himself to be a priest and he he
[36:50] retained all kinds of other people to be
[36:53] priests and to handle the word of God
[36:54] and to burn incense etc etc and so a man
[36:58] of God came they I don't think he's even
[37:01] named and he cries out he's a man from
[37:04] Judah and he cries out against Josiah I
[37:07] not Josiah but against Gerobam who had
[37:11] he was king over 10 of the nations or 10
[37:14] of the tribes I should
[37:16] of Israel. And and he had taken his he
[37:19] taken a position that was not his to
[37:22] handle uh incense before God. And this
[37:26] man and he cried against the altar in
[37:29] the in the word of the Lord and and
[37:32] said, "Oh altar, altar,
[37:35] thus saith the Lord, behold, a child
[37:38] shall be born unto the house of David,
[37:41] Josiah by name, and upon thee shall he
[37:45] offer the priests of the high places
[37:49] that burn incense upon him." It wasn't
[37:52] that he offered the priests, but he
[37:54] offered their bones. Those that had died
[37:56] and he offered their bones. And this man
[37:58] was crying against it.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; And he said, "A child will be born,
[38:05] a different child."
[38:08] And she immediately, this is Sister
[38:09] Danka,
[38:12] doesn't know that Yolena's in the
[38:14] hospital and calls Yolena's mother,
[38:19] asking, "Is he here?
[38:23] Has Josiah come?"
[38:26] I was very touched, Ryan said, when I
[38:29] received it. And I'd still struggled
[38:31] with what his name should be and felt
[38:34] the Lord was very mindful of our desire
[38:37] in choosing the right name for our son.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; And I believe you've chosen the right
[38:43] name for your son.
[38:46] And uh you tell your mom that I I read
[38:49] this. If she's not streaming right,
[38:51] she's here. God bless you. God bless
[38:53] you.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; We're going to dedicate Josiah
[39:06] Isn't he a fine boy?
[39:11] We'll pray.
[39:14] Heavenly Father,
[39:17] we are touched and moved at your word.
[39:21] You know all things from beginning to
[39:23] end. And you know even the word that
[39:25] you've put on my heart today.
[39:28] and how I waited before you regarding
[39:32] this dedication
[39:34] and you found Josiah in the Bible. You
[39:38] ordained him to be a king
[39:41] and you ordained him as a young boy at 8
[39:44] years old to become a king.
[39:47] And when he was 18, he found the book,
[39:51] &gt;&gt; oh God, and he began to turn the hearts
[39:53] of Israel towards you. and he made such
[39:56] a repentance and he wept when he found
[39:59] the book. May that spirit be upon this
[40:03] son. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ,
[40:07] oh God, as you have given Josiah
[40:10] to sister Yolina and brother Ryan that
[40:13] they will raise him in the fear of the
[40:15] Lord. And Lord, I pray your blessing
[40:18] upon him. I pray your Holy Spirit shall
[40:21] come not only upon him but into him. We
[40:25] dedicate him to you. We dedicate him for
[40:28] all the days that you give him upon the
[40:30] earth. And whatever time we have from
[40:32] now till the rapture, use him. I pray. I
[40:36] pray you'll use his father and his
[40:38] mother. Oh God. You will gift them with
[40:41] divine wisdom. May they have a source,
[40:44] oh God, from the throne of God to raise
[40:47] their children in this wicked and vile
[40:50] and dark generation. May they be lights,
[40:53] oh God. May this son be a light. Use
[40:57] him. I pray in the name of Jesus. May
[41:00] your hand be upon him from this day
[41:02] forward. May your hand be upon his
[41:05] parents. May your hand be upon his
[41:08] grandparents,
[41:10] oh God. And may all of them be blessed
[41:12] because of his life in the name of Jesus
[41:16] Christ. May he learn of you, Lord Jesus.
[41:20] May he learn of you. And I pray may he
[41:23] be like James,
[41:25] oh God, one that will be close to your
[41:27] heart. Father, I dedicate Josiah James
[41:33] Hayes to you in the name of Jesus
[41:36] Christ.
[41:37] Amen.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Elena. God bless you.
[41:46] Bless you, brother Ryan. And God bless
[41:50] you, Josiah.
[41:56] You may wonder why we take so much time.
[41:59] Some of the some of the messages which I
[42:02] find are so very very important that
[42:05] brother Brandham was speaking. He had
[42:07] time to dedicate the children. Did you
[42:10] ever think of that? Of course you did.
[42:15] Sometime I'm so waiting for the message.
[42:17] I think, oh,
[42:19] are these are these kids this important?
[42:22] I guess they are.
[42:24] They are certainly to the mothers and
[42:26] fathers.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to
[42:32] speak to you this morning.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; And I I want to really
[42:39] ask you to pray for yourself sincerely.
[42:43] God, give me eyes to see, our heart to
[42:48] understand what it is you've spoken to
[42:51] us in this generation.
[42:53] What you've spoken to us, the wonderful
[42:56] things you've left in the word of God. I
[42:59] know without even asking that we've all
[43:02] read the scripture and we wondered,
[43:04] "What does that mean?"
[43:06] Thank God
[43:07] &gt;&gt; for a prophet that gave us some
[43:09] understanding
[43:11] &gt;&gt; in these things.
[43:13] Amen. Amen.
[43:15] I wonder if I you would stand with me
[43:18] and I'm going to ask you to come.
[43:21] Brother Nathan, I want to just sing
[43:25] uh We'll walk the the course. We'll walk
[43:28] in the light, the beautiful light.
[43:34] We are here.
[43:47] Mercy.
[43:50] Oh sh all around us. My
[43:58] Jesus
[44:00] the light of the world. Now, I'd like to
[44:04] just I'd like to have you just
[44:05] personalize it and sing it uh sing it as
[44:09] a prayer, but don't sing it quite as
[44:12] slow as you're singing it.
[44:15] I'd like to just pick it up. That's
[44:16] brother Ed's speed. We'll walk in the
[44:21] light. It's a beautiful
[44:25] light
[44:29] of the mercy.
[44:33] Oh sh all around us. My
[44:40] Jesus
[44:46] will
[45:01] all around my head and my life
[45:09] of the world.
[45:12] While you're standing, we'll pray.
[45:13] Heavenly Father,
[45:16] we're coming to you not in a formality.
[45:19] We're coming to you because we want to
[45:21] come to you. We're coming to you because
[45:24] you have invited us to come. And you
[45:27] have invited us because you desire to
[45:29] pour out your blessings, multiple
[45:33] blessings. You want to pour out the
[45:36] spirit of revelation, the spirit of
[45:39] adoption. Cause us to mature in the word
[45:42] of God. I pray you'll cause us to see
[45:45] things we have not seen before, things
[45:48] that will inspire us, things that will
[45:51] let us know who we are in the body of
[45:54] Jesus Christ. Bless these dear people, I
[45:57] pray, Father, as we call one another
[45:59] brothers and sisters in the kingdom of
[46:02] God, children of the living God, in the
[46:06] name of Jesus Christ, we claim it as our
[46:09] own possession. Amen. And amen. Amen.
[46:13] God bless you as you turn in the Bible
[46:16] to Hebrews the 11th chapter.
[46:29] I don't want to make a couple of
[46:30] comments about Hebrews 11.
[46:35] I am praying and I really desire that it
[46:38] will be more than a scripture reading.
[46:42] I pray that you will also remember me in
[46:46] prayer as I
[46:48] uh come to this. I've been pondering
[46:50] this for some time.
[46:53] Uh we need to identify ourselves in the
[46:56] scripture.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; And once we identify ourselves, we need
[47:00] to
[47:02] accept that
[47:04] &gt;&gt; and we need to accept it so completely
[47:07] that Satan will have no way to attack
[47:09] it.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. will say God said this and you
[47:13] have no part of God's word.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; And that's where I want you to come to
[47:17] this morning.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; A life lived
[47:23] for God is the substance
[47:27] and the evidence of things not seen. I'm
[47:30] just saying that as a pre
[47:34] to prelude the reading of the scripture.
[47:38] The Old Testament saints are recorded in
[47:41] Hebrews 11, which is called often the
[47:44] faith chapter,
[47:46] and they fulfilled and thus essentially
[47:49] are the Old Testament.
[47:52] They are the Old Testament. Without the
[47:54] characters, without those that are
[47:56] recorded in Hebrews 11, you don't have
[47:58] an Old Testament.
[48:01] So it's not that the Old Testament is
[48:04] something that God wrote and somehow
[48:06] these people were involved. That's not
[48:09] it. It is that God recorded their lives
[48:14] &gt;&gt; and that was his word being lived out
[48:18] through them.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; And that was the Old Testament. And it
[48:21] concluded with Jesus Christ who was the
[48:24] word. This is where I'm going.
[48:27] And the prophet of God has said, "The
[48:29] bride of Jesus Christ, the piece that
[48:31] was struck off of the masterpiece, she
[48:34] will fulfill the New Testament."
[48:37] &gt;&gt; I want you to say, and I want you to
[48:39] know today, and whether you think that I
[48:42] go overboard, that's perfectly fine. But
[48:44] I want to say things in in such a
[48:46] straight direct way. You are not here
[48:49] merely going to church.
[48:51] You are not here just to worship even
[48:53] around a message that has been sent.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; You are here because God has certain
[48:59] people,
[49:00] &gt;&gt; certain individuals and and he they are
[49:03] certain individuals. They're elect of
[49:05] God
[49:06] &gt;&gt; and God brought by their way his word
[49:11] and they believed it because they were
[49:13] ordained to believe it
[49:15] &gt;&gt; and they are the New Testament.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might say that's overboard.
[49:21] Somebody's got to fulfill it.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And you might as well take it and say it
[49:27] and declare it and say that is me.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; I have been called into this.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; So the bride of Jesus Christ will
[49:37] fulfill the new testament and brother
[49:39] Brandham simply says husband and wife.
[49:42] The old testament the new testament is
[49:43] simply husband and wife. So now we will
[49:46] read
[49:47] out of uh Hebrews the 11th chapter
[49:52] just a verse or two. Now faith
[49:57] verse one. Now faith is the substance of
[50:00] things hoped for the evidence of things
[50:04] not seen.
[50:06] I'm going to let you have your seats.
[50:30] Maybe we can just dim the lights a wee
[50:31] bit.
[50:37] Faith is the substance
[50:40] of things hoped for. the evidence of
[50:42] things not seen.
[50:45] Now, this is where I'll be going. You
[50:48] are substance.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; And I will show you in the scripture
[50:55] where God knew about your substance
[50:58] before your mother and father did.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; God knew about your substance
[51:05] &gt;&gt; before you were ever thought of. Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; When your forefathers were here, maybe
[51:11] with clubs on their back, God knew that
[51:15] you were going to be here.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, his election in his
[51:21] mind is so the prophet said, "God can
[51:24] learn nothing.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; He knew everything. He's omnipresent and
[51:29] he's omnisient." Now, in case I go over
[51:33] your head, just forget that.
[51:37] I I I
[51:40] spoke a couple of these things to my
[51:41] wife and I said, "Now, don't think about
[51:43] it. This is just what he said.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Just accept that.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out." Because the
[51:51] thing is, you can't figure it out. I
[51:54] can't figure it out. You can't figure it
[51:56] out. Nobody and anyone who tries to
[51:58] figure it out simply gets more tangled
[52:01] up.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; You accept that?
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:08] And the evidence, their lives that were
[52:11] lived out was the evidence of the unseen
[52:15] God.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; That there was an unseen God at some
[52:19] point in their life.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; What they lived and what they held to
[52:25] and what they believed and what they
[52:26] confessed.
[52:28] Now, we're not talking about their
[52:30] errors and their mistakes. They all made
[52:32] mistakes. Right.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "All the prophets had
[52:36] flaws.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; All of them had flaws.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; We all have flaws.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; God's not holding back redemption
[52:45] because of our flaws.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; He in fact will turn flaws into the very
[52:50] glory of God.
[52:52] Even Even if he has to save some from
[52:55] the very depths,
[52:57] &gt;&gt; the very depths of sin,
[53:00] &gt;&gt; even if he has to take a harlot and make
[53:03] her and bring her into the motherhood of
[53:05] Jesus Christ,
[53:07] &gt;&gt; someone you wouldn't have as your
[53:08] neighbor
[53:10] &gt;&gt; to our shame
[53:12] &gt;&gt; because we just don't have enough h of
[53:15] of God's mind and God's thought and
[53:17] God's attribute. God is so complete in
[53:21] his redemption
[53:23] &gt;&gt; and he wanted to he wanted it to be so
[53:25] forward in the scripture. So he'll put
[53:27] it in the most uh famous book that ever
[53:30] struck the earth, the Bible.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; And he will write it right in the
[53:34] scripture. And he will he will put uh he
[53:38] will put women that were not uh not only
[53:42] below
[53:44] the perfect, he will take not only
[53:47] imperfect
[53:48] &gt;&gt; but he will take reprobate
[53:51] &gt;&gt; as the world would say reprobate
[53:54] &gt;&gt; because he is declaring the power of his
[53:57] creative blood.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to redeem these people. I'm
[54:02] going to redeem them. And not only
[54:05] redeem them, I'm not merely going to
[54:07] forgive them. I'm going to make them
[54:09] spotless.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring them in from the old
[54:13] creation into the new creation.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11 is a record of ordinary
[54:24] people who believed what God promised
[54:28] and thus became the evidence of things
[54:31] not seen.
[54:34] They essentially are the Old Testament
[54:39] substance and here's the meaning of the
[54:41] word and we will we will just uh major
[54:44] on certain things. It will be confidence
[54:47] and that is no surprise to you also.
[54:50] They have a word that just says person.
[54:53] It it it substance is a person can be a
[54:58] person. You all are persons and you all
[55:01] are substance and that's the substance I
[55:04] want to I want to emphasize today.
[55:07] Sorry, I want to go back please.
[55:12] That which has foundation substance is
[55:14] that which has foundation is firm.
[55:19] Hence that which has actual existence,
[55:22] actual existence,
[55:25] a substance, a real being,
[55:28] the substantial quality or nature of a
[55:31] person, the steadfastness of mind,
[55:35] courage, firm trust, assurance in fact
[55:38] is because you are the substance of God.
[55:42] You can't be moved.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; That's the truth of it. And that is why
[55:47] the word has to be assurance and
[55:49] firmness and foundation. You have all of
[55:52] those.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; The believer has all of those.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; The believer cannot be moved. If you can
[55:59] be moved, you aren't a believer.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; But a believer cannot be moved. A
[56:04] believer cannot give up.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Just can't give up.
[56:08] may get to the point and and others
[56:11] around the country might think that uh
[56:13] they they should give up or they would
[56:15] give up but they can't give up
[56:18] &gt;&gt; the steadfastness of mind and courage.
[56:33] Could I go to the next one? Thank you.
[56:39] We are still on substance.
[56:42] It's to cause or make to stand
[56:46] to be immovable. You think or perhaps
[56:49] you thought, well, the day came when I
[56:52] became convinced and I received Christ.
[56:55] That's partially true. But you couldn't
[56:58] receive him unless he received you.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; He called you. as many as are called,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; he glorified.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's done the work
[57:10] &gt;&gt; and we give him all the glory
[57:13] &gt;&gt; uh to be substances to cause to stand,
[57:18] to be immovable,
[57:20] to make firm, to establish, to cause a
[57:24] person to keep his or her place, to
[57:28] cause them to keep the place. Satan may
[57:30] have attempted to move you a multitude
[57:33] of times, but he has failed. He's the
[57:36] one that's failed. Not you failed. He
[57:38] failed.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; He could not make you move.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; To stand unharmed.
[57:46] Oh my, how many times you may feel that
[57:50] God has allowed you to be harmed. You're
[57:52] not harmed.
[57:56] ready or prepared to be a steadfast mind
[58:00] and one who does not hesitate
[58:02] &gt;&gt; and does not waver.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; I'd like the congregation to say does
[58:07] not waver.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. Does not waver.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Satan, have you heard that?
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Does not waver.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; The the redeemed of the Lord
[58:21] &gt;&gt; said, does not waver.
[58:24] steadfast, has a foundation, immovable,
[58:29] has an assurance, and we are the
[58:31] persons.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; We are the substance.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; That is our substance.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And Christianity,
[58:44] the prophet said, cannot be understood.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; We ought to make that a a motto.
[58:50] Christianity cannot be understood. Not
[58:53] not the Christianity of the world. This
[58:55] Christianity cannot be understood. It is
[58:59] to be lived.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Well, we say amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; It is to be lived by faith. We do these
[59:06] things. The whole works is by faith
[59:10] through grace.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; And the scriptures that we have here, I
[59:27] haven't got time to go into them in
[59:30] Hebrews 11, but by faith Abel, notice
[59:34] where it starts in the garden. By faith
[59:37] Abel, by faith Enoch, by faith Noah, by
[59:40] faith Abraham, and through faith also
[59:43] Sarah herself received strength. And I'm
[59:46] reading that because she received
[59:49] strength to conceive seed, and was
[59:52] delivered of a child, when she was past
[59:56] age, because she judged him faithful who
[59:59] had promised. Therefore, the Bible says,
[1:00:02] "Therefore sprang thereup." This is the
[1:00:05] 12th verse, the 11th chapter. Therefore
[1:00:08] sprang there even of one, and him as
[1:00:13] good as dead, so many as the stars of
[1:00:16] the sky in the multitude in multitude,
[1:00:20] and as the sand of the sea uh and the
[1:00:24] sand of and as the sand which is by the
[1:00:27] seashore innumerable.
[1:00:30] The Bible says these all the verse 13
[1:00:33] these all died in faith not having
[1:00:37] received the promises. They died while
[1:00:40] they lived. They lived but they died in
[1:00:43] faith because that's what they were.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; That's what the substance was. They died
[1:00:48] in faith believing things that uh they
[1:00:52] had not seen yet.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; But their lives were declaring the
[1:00:56] unseen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; That's what you're here for. you you're
[1:01:00] not here, friends, you're not here to
[1:01:03] simply get an education. I say to the
[1:01:05] young people, you're not here m merely
[1:01:08] to enter a profession. That's not why
[1:01:11] you're here. You're here because God
[1:01:13] called you to be here. And I want to
[1:01:16] show you from the prophet's ministry how
[1:01:19] how he declared it
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; and and and how we should esteem that uh
[1:01:26] that prophet of God and God's work down
[1:01:29] through the ages. How he speaks of
[1:01:32] bringing the masterpiece of Jesus Christ
[1:01:35] for about 4,000 years and then at
[1:01:38] Calvary strikes him to strike off a
[1:01:40] piece. For out of him came the life,
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; the life of the new creation.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; And that's why he declared to the
[1:01:48] seventh messenger in the book of
[1:01:51] Revelation that he was the new the
[1:01:53] beginning of the new creation.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; The beginning of the new creation.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; And this same Bible says that you are in
[1:02:03] Christ. So you are in the new creation.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. And thus we
[1:02:11] sing, of course, I am a new creation.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; I'm a newb born. That's why we have a
[1:02:17] new birth. Except you be born again, you
[1:02:20] cannot see the kingdom of God.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; And these all died in faith, not having
[1:02:27] received the promises, but having I want
[1:02:30] you to notice about four things here.
[1:02:33] Having number one seen them a far off.
[1:02:37] Not everybody saw them. These people saw
[1:02:39] them. They saw the promises a far off.
[1:02:44] They p they were persuaded of them.
[1:02:47] Number
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; and embraced them. Number three,
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; and confessed that they were strangers
[1:02:55] and pilgrims on the earth.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; You need to confess that
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; I'm in my work. I'm doing my duties. I'm
[1:03:03] at my job. I'm to do the best I can
[1:03:06] because I'm a child of God. I I'm to do
[1:03:09] the very best I can. But they don't own
[1:03:11] my soul.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; My soul is from God.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; They they can they can have the labors
[1:03:20] of this body,
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; but they do not own my soul. I must feed
[1:03:24] my soul. I must have time with my God. I
[1:03:29] worship my God. That has nothing to do
[1:03:31] with this world. This world cannot see
[1:03:34] the promises of God the way God is
[1:03:37] showing them to you.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; And so they seen the promises a far off
[1:03:44] and they were persuaded of them
[1:03:49] and we should be putting ourselves
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; in front of that.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; And we are persuaded of them
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; and we embrace them
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; and we confess as a result of all of
[1:04:01] this process. We confess that we're
[1:04:03] strangers and pilgrims here.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; If you feel uncomfortable in this world,
[1:04:09] good.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; This world is not a welcome place for
[1:04:13] the believer.
[1:04:18] And by faith it goes on then after
[1:04:22] Abraham and by and Sarah by faith Isaac
[1:04:25] and by faith Jacob by faith Joseph by
[1:04:28] faith Moses by faith the harlot Rahab
[1:04:33] my what's she doing in there and what
[1:04:35] shall I say more for the time would fail
[1:04:39] me
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of
[1:04:44] Samson and of Jeff, Jeff was born of a
[1:04:48] harlot
[1:04:50] and David also and Samuel and of the
[1:04:53] prophets. Listen friends, when I drop in
[1:04:56] and say he's the son of a harlot, don't
[1:04:58] fall quiet.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Say, "Glory,
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; great is our God."
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And what shall I say more of these?
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; It says, "Quench the violence of fire.
[1:05:15] escaped the edge of the sword. Out of
[1:05:17] weakness were made strong, waxed valiant
[1:05:21] and valiant in fight and turned to
[1:05:23] flight the armies of the aliens. How did
[1:05:27] they do that? By their own power and
[1:05:29] strength? No.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; No. By the power of God. And now in the
[1:05:34] New Testament, the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:37] is casting out demons and sending the
[1:05:40] word of God amongst the people.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And even if you could see it just now,
[1:05:46] Satan hates these words that I'm saying
[1:05:49] because it's going to defeat him
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; in people's lives.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's going to set people
[1:05:56] that he has bound free and shackles are
[1:05:59] going to fall and sick people are going
[1:06:02] to be healed. Not because of myself. No,
[1:06:05] not at all. That's because of the word
[1:06:07] of the living God. And that's what the
[1:06:10] word does. The word heals. The word
[1:06:13] defeats the enemy. The word sends the
[1:06:15] aliens to flight and flight. And I say,
[1:06:18] "Glory be to this God."
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not up here just because I'm
[1:06:23] inspired. I'm up here because that's
[1:06:25] God's holy word.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there is no one like our
[1:06:30] God.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; He called you.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You need to say that you called me.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; You brought me here.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here in this building
[1:06:42] today. We're not interested in a
[1:06:44] Cloverdale Bible Way Church. We're
[1:06:46] interested in a place we can hear the
[1:06:48] word of God, where we can fellowship
[1:06:50] with people of like precious faith.
[1:06:54] Hallelujah.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And these all having obtained a good
[1:07:01] report through faith received not the
[1:07:04] promises. God having provided some
[1:07:08] better thing for us that they without us
[1:07:13] should not be made perfect or not be
[1:07:16] made complete.
[1:07:18] All of these heroes,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; do you hear me?
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; All of these heroes are depending upon
[1:07:26] us, depending upon you sitting here
[1:07:29] listening to me today. I'm simply
[1:07:32] telling you this is what God has said.
[1:07:35] This is what God thinks. And God let
[1:07:37] them live their lives and the whole Old
[1:07:40] Testament record with all the great
[1:07:43] courage that they showed. and they were
[1:07:45] slain and cast before lions and and and
[1:07:49] and went into bondage. Also, God's
[1:07:52] people went into bondage, but God would
[1:07:54] deliver them when they cried in in
[1:07:57] repentance.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:03] So, I have some other scriptures.
[1:08:06] There one theme today.
[1:08:08] It's the substance.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; You are that substance.
[1:08:14] Hallelujah.
[1:08:37] David said, "My substance
[1:08:41] was not hid from thee when I was made in
[1:08:44] secret, and curiously rot in the lowest
[1:08:48] parts of the earth.
[1:08:51] Thine eyes did see my substance or my
[1:08:54] embryo or my fetus,
[1:08:56] yet being unperfect.
[1:08:59] And in thy book all my members were
[1:09:02] written, which in continuence were
[1:09:04] fashioned, when as yet there was none of
[1:09:07] them.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; That's our God.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; That's when he saw you.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, how precious also are
[1:09:17] thy thoughts unto me. unto me,
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; oh God, how great is the sum of them.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; If I should count them, they are more in
[1:09:27] number than the sand.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And when I awake, I am still with thee.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; And when I awake, I'm still with thee.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hello. Wake up, folks.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; I'm still with thee. That means I'm with
[1:09:45] you now.
[1:09:46] But when I awake, I'm still with
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; thee.
[1:10:05] I want the next slide, please.
[1:10:15] When a man lives, that's the one I want.
[1:10:19] When a man lives by faith
[1:10:22] and walks by faith. Now, if if we think
[1:10:25] that faith is something,
[1:10:28] I've got to get somehow get this faith.
[1:10:31] No, what you have to do is believe what
[1:10:34] he said.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; To believe it, simply believe it. That's
[1:10:41] faith.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; To doubt it, that's sin.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; That's the difference. That's where it
[1:10:48] begins and that's where it ends.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; To believe it is faith.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And to doubt it is sin.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; And all the other things that goes on in
[1:10:59] the world is attributes of sin.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; That's why they didn't really matter
[1:11:05] that much to God.
[1:11:11] I may qualify that.
[1:11:14] Are there great sins? Yeah, there are.
[1:11:18] There were sins in the Old Testament
[1:11:20] that were the that they required the
[1:11:23] death penalty and that's why Jesus died.
[1:11:27] He did the death penalty
[1:11:30] for us.
[1:11:32] And that is why they could take those
[1:11:34] from the Old Testament that even should
[1:11:37] have been burned or should have died and
[1:11:42] God took them and placed them in the
[1:11:45] most holy and revered place
[1:11:48] in the very motherhood and lineage of
[1:11:51] Jesus Christ.
[1:11:58] When a man lives by faith and walks by
[1:12:02] faith, I mean substance faith, he is
[1:12:07] isolated from the entire world. And
[1:12:09] because and becomes a new creature in
[1:12:12] Christ there. Now you're getting into
[1:12:16] bride material.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; You're getting into rapturing condition.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Now he said that means more. That means
[1:12:25] for each one of us not just the pastor,
[1:12:28] deacons, trustees, but means that for
[1:12:32] the leoty may means for the leoty. Every
[1:12:35] individual walks in a world with God
[1:12:38] alone. Every individual, I don't care
[1:12:42] how young you are. I don't care how old
[1:12:44] you are. I don't care if you're married,
[1:12:46] unmarried, or anything else. That has
[1:12:49] nothing to do with that.
[1:12:50] Every individual that's in this category
[1:12:54] that walks by faith and walks by in fact
[1:12:58] is if you're a believer, you walk by
[1:13:01] faith because of what you're believing.
[1:13:03] You simply believe it.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; And maybe you can't even explain why you
[1:13:08] believe it. I don't know why I believe
[1:13:10] it, but I believe these things. I
[1:13:12] believe it. And you leave the result in
[1:13:14] the consequence of God.
[1:13:17] And you live as an individual walks in
[1:13:20] the world alone with God or with God
[1:13:24] alone.
[1:13:29] You're baptized. This is continuing on.
[1:13:32] You're baptized into this kingdom and
[1:13:35] there's nobody in there but you and God.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; He gives the orders
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; and you pack them out.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; He gives the orders. He gives the word
[1:13:47] and you live it out.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; You're the substance.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; You receive the orders.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; You receive them and you believe them
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; and you live them out. You pack it out.
[1:13:59] You live them out. And thus you are
[1:14:02] giving evidence of the unseen God.
[1:14:08] You pack them out. Whatever he says.
[1:14:11] There's not a shadow of doubt nowhere.
[1:14:13] You walk right on it. If the Lord says
[1:14:17] this, there's nobody in the world can
[1:14:19] talk you out of it.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; You go right on just the same. Now
[1:14:24] you're coming into perfect faith.
[1:14:27] Perfect. Perfect perfection that cannot
[1:14:30] fail. That faith never fails.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; That's a kind of faith. And that is so
[1:14:38] simple. Whatever you do, don't stumble
[1:14:40] over the simplicity of it. Amen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; And when I say believe, I'm not don't
[1:14:48] don't put it at the in the category of
[1:14:52] people who believe a say a certain
[1:14:54] religion. Say, well, I'm a believer. I I
[1:14:57] believe a certain religion or I believe
[1:14:59] a certain doctrine. I believe a certain
[1:15:02] uh uh a certain thing that's personal or
[1:15:05] private to me or whatever more. That's
[1:15:08] not it. I'm talking about, and I'll be
[1:15:10] coming to it in a few moments,
[1:15:14] believing something that God
[1:15:16] supernaturally vindicates.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; It really hinges there because that's
[1:15:23] the only difference really. When it
[1:15:25] boils down to it, that's the only
[1:15:27] difference. I believe a vindicated word.
[1:15:31] When I say a vindicated word, a proven
[1:15:33] word at somewhere along the line, God
[1:15:36] comes
[1:15:38] and and he does it.
[1:15:42] And when he does it,
[1:15:44] uh uh I'm I'm just holding myself back
[1:15:47] because I I want you to say very very
[1:15:50] keen and very very alert. When God does
[1:15:52] it, there's no human involved. Right.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; I know a lot of you know say about the
[1:16:01] meetings in Switzerland. Oh, are you
[1:16:04] going to Switzerland? Are there going to
[1:16:05] be meetings in Switzerland? Da da da.
[1:16:08] And I know that that gets into the
[1:16:10] convention category. That's not what it
[1:16:13] is.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; The meetings in Switzerland began in a
[1:16:18] chair that I can show you in my study.
[1:16:21] And you young men that were there and
[1:16:23] others that were there see where I sit
[1:16:26] when I study. sitting in that chair
[1:16:29] looking at a computer screen that
[1:16:32] technology provided and getting an email
[1:16:35] on the internet that technology has
[1:16:37] provided and reading two lines because I
[1:16:40] did go to school for a short time and I
[1:16:43] could read and say you know I heard I
[1:16:46] saw the message and I was streamed the
[1:16:50] message and I was blessed by the message
[1:16:52] and then comes a voice.
[1:16:55] This is a wounded one and her husband
[1:16:59] doesn't know she's written this
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; that I didn't invite
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; that I didn't call for
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; that I didn't try to generate
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; something I didn't try to get into some
[1:17:13] holy place
[1:17:15] that I believed
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; because it was divine
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; because it wasn't human. Now, if a voice
[1:17:24] said, "Go and do some dastardly thing
[1:17:26] and some terrible crime," I would know
[1:17:29] it was from another place. But when it
[1:17:32] says, "This is a wounded one." And her
[1:17:34] husband doesn't know she's written this.
[1:17:37] I go back to that often over the last
[1:17:40] seven years and say, "You spoke that.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; You had a plan. That was your voice."
[1:17:47] And I act on that voice. And because of
[1:17:50] that,
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; we get on a plane. Because of that we
[1:17:54] will we will speak to other people.
[1:17:57] Because of that we would invite. Because
[1:17:59] of that people are coming from maybe
[1:18:01] about 20 countries. One of the biggest
[1:18:04] problems right now they don't know where
[1:18:05] they will put all the people. One of the
[1:18:07] brothers said I need a jackhammer to be
[1:18:10] able to uh remove a concrete wall. They
[1:18:13] extended it last year so it to go from
[1:18:16] 300 people to 400 people. Are we are we
[1:18:20] enthused about the numbers? No, no, not
[1:18:23] a bit.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Not a bit. That whatever may maybe they
[1:18:27] come because it's a convention or a
[1:18:29] special meeting or whatever more. I'll
[1:18:30] tell you that some people come simply
[1:18:33] because there was a there was a certain
[1:18:35] atmosphere.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; It was as though God put his hand around
[1:18:39] it. And the best way I could describe
[1:18:41] it, it was as though God cast a cover
[1:18:45] over it with a draw string on the bottom
[1:18:48] and pulled it tight. And I told people
[1:18:51] after the first meeting, God is saying,
[1:18:53] "This is mine.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; And I won't let anyone touch it.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let anybody disturb
[1:19:00] this." And people were there from from
[1:19:03] this side to this side. And they were as
[1:19:05] far apart in their doctrine as you could
[1:19:08] believe. One was maybe hyping up one
[1:19:10] thing and another one, another one, and
[1:19:12] somebody staying out of it all. And God
[1:19:15] pulled them all into one in one place
[1:19:17] and said pulled a drawstring and he
[1:19:20] didn't even allow one ounce in seven
[1:19:22] years. I haven't heard anybody even make
[1:19:25] a suggestion of a doctrine, anything of
[1:19:29] anything special. They're just so happy
[1:19:31] to come and hear the word of God. Do you
[1:19:34] know what? People are fed up with
[1:19:36] personalities.
[1:19:37] They're fed up with man's efforts.
[1:19:40] They're fed up. They're just fed up with
[1:19:42] all these issues and doctrines. They
[1:19:46] want to hear the word of God.
[1:19:50] And you want to sit here and pray for
[1:19:52] the men that stand behind this pulpit.
[1:19:54] Oh God, end them with your word and endo
[1:19:58] and illuminate my mind so that I
[1:20:01] understand what you have said. That's
[1:20:03] all we're here for, friends. We're not
[1:20:05] here to play church. We're not here for
[1:20:08] a social gathering. We're here that we
[1:20:11] might hear the word of God. And I said
[1:20:13] to our Lord Jesus this morning, Lord
[1:20:16] Jesus, I don't even know how to pray.
[1:20:18] But when we come to the house of God,
[1:20:20] will you please continue? You build your
[1:20:23] church.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; You build your people.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; You take the substance and build it
[1:20:31] stone by stone.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:43] Glory to God.
[1:20:52] By faith Abraham
[1:20:54] when he was called to go into a place
[1:20:58] which he should after receive for an
[1:21:01] inheritance, he obeyed and he went out
[1:21:04] not knowing whether he went.
[1:21:07] by faith. Abraham
[1:21:10] the substance.
[1:21:12] Abraham
[1:21:14] is the substance. He's a man like you
[1:21:16] men.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; He's a man like you, brother Peter, that
[1:21:20] sang a song.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; He's a man like you men who have gone
[1:21:26] through deep trials
[1:21:28] and went through impossible situations.
[1:21:32] And Sarah's a woman like you women.
[1:21:35] You've had all kinds of difficulties.
[1:21:37] She's had all kinds. They had they had
[1:21:39] strife in their home between Hagar and
[1:21:42] her. And they had an Ishmamail and a
[1:21:45] situation. And Abraham had strife
[1:21:47] between the servants of Lot's cattle and
[1:21:51] his cattle. And they had all kinds of
[1:21:53] different kinds of struggles.
[1:21:57] But he had one thing in mind. That is
[1:22:00] God spoke.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; God said, and I believe that. And by
[1:22:05] that he became your father.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; He became the father of the faith.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Why the father? Because he believed what
[1:22:12] God said.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said these visions
[1:22:23] are perfectly true.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; They are sent from God.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because a man, I can't just stand
[1:22:35] here and say, "I'm going to have a
[1:22:37] vision."
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; That has to come from another dimension.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; That has to come from another realm.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; That has to come to one who's selected
[1:22:46] and elected to be able to receive those
[1:22:49] things.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Have to be born that way.
[1:23:07] I have desired many times, please don't
[1:23:10] read this ahead of me.
[1:23:13] I desired many times so I could try
[1:23:17] and convey to you people
[1:23:20] things
[1:23:22] in brother Benham's life and ministry
[1:23:25] that would help you to understand
[1:23:28] where the message comes from and what
[1:23:30] you've been called into.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; And so lay everything aside just now for
[1:23:37] a moment as I read. This is probably one
[1:23:39] of the best
[1:23:42] that I
[1:23:45] have read. I read it to the brothers in
[1:23:47] the study last Sunday. I was so
[1:23:49] impressed with it.
[1:23:51] Brother Brandham said, "I would never
[1:23:53] bring a person to the platform
[1:23:56] if it wasn't for one thing, that I might
[1:23:59] get face to face with the person."
[1:24:02] Many times out in the building, you'll
[1:24:05] hear me call people and things.
[1:24:09] I see it materialize
[1:24:12] to stop there.
[1:24:15] He sees something materialize.
[1:24:21] He said, "Many times out in the
[1:24:23] building, you'll hear me call people."
[1:24:26] So he calls a certain identifies a
[1:24:30] certain person. He said, "And I see it
[1:24:33] materialize."
[1:24:35] The very life before me materializes.
[1:24:40] Life, that's kind of an ambiguous
[1:24:42] statement. What is life?
[1:24:46] What is life?
[1:24:48] But he sees life. You say, "Well, it's
[1:24:50] material substance." Well, it hasn't
[1:24:52] yet. He sees it materialize.
[1:24:56] He sees He knows that it's life, and it
[1:24:58] materializes.
[1:25:00] the very life before me materializes.
[1:25:03] Maybe I start here and look out yonder
[1:25:07] and I see a little girl say
[1:25:11] and it'll start materializing
[1:25:14] and I see the way she's and he stops.
[1:25:19] He stops. He needs to stop because he's
[1:25:22] he he can't make it everything
[1:25:24] hypothetical.
[1:25:26] He said something happens and I'll just
[1:25:30] start speaking what I see. So he sees a
[1:25:33] little girl and he just it's
[1:25:36] materializing. The life is
[1:25:37] materializing. He sees a little girl and
[1:25:41] then something happens. So then he just
[1:25:44] starts to speak what he sees happening
[1:25:48] and then he speaks I he says and I and
[1:25:52] and something happens and I'll just
[1:25:55] start speaking what I see and then after
[1:25:58] a while it'll leave before me and maybe
[1:26:02] right along here sets the woman.
[1:26:06] He sees in the vision a little girl.
[1:26:11] He sees a life and the life begins to he
[1:26:15] explain that brother Biscll. I can't
[1:26:16] explain it. You can't explain it. He
[1:26:19] couldn't explain it. God is the author
[1:26:22] of life.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; So he sees a life and it starts to
[1:26:26] materialize.
[1:26:28] He sees a little girl and then something
[1:26:31] happens. Then he begins to speak what's
[1:26:34] happening. what he sees taking place.
[1:26:38] And after a while, he said, "It leaves
[1:26:41] from before me and maybe right along
[1:26:44] here sets a woman. She's done come down
[1:26:48] to this age."
[1:26:56] He saw your substance.
[1:27:01] I will read a little earlier a little
[1:27:04] later I will read where
[1:27:08] you came here by election even in the
[1:27:12] there's a natural selection
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; the sperm of your father
[1:27:21] and the seed into which that sperm went.
[1:27:27] There was uh there was a certain
[1:27:29] election.
[1:27:31] The color of your hair, the color of
[1:27:33] your skin, the color of your eyes,
[1:27:37] all of those things were determined
[1:27:40] not by father, not by mother, by an
[1:27:44] intelligence.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; I say that intelligence is God.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And that was a natural selection. That
[1:27:52] was a natural election that brought you
[1:27:55] here in this substance. God knew you
[1:27:59] before that ever happened. He knew you
[1:28:02] before the the the natural selection
[1:28:06] took place. And then you came here into
[1:28:10] a physical body. Your mother and father
[1:28:13] received you as a baby and dealt with
[1:28:16] you and cared for you all through life.
[1:28:20] and you had a certain name and you were
[1:28:22] raised in a certain country and all of
[1:28:25] those things. God knew all of that
[1:28:27] before it ever happened.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; And then somewhere along the line,
[1:28:32] God, if you were called by him, he sent
[1:28:37] a certain word or certain witness or
[1:28:39] certain testimony by your way
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; and something smoked you inside. Said
[1:28:46] that's truth. I can't explain it but
[1:28:49] it's true.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Something has spoke. Someone asked me
[1:28:52] when did you see that brother Brad Pam
[1:28:54] was Malachi 4. I can't tell you exactly.
[1:28:57] He mentioned Malachi 4. He mentioned
[1:29:00] Malachi 4 and and and and and just said
[1:29:04] and he'll turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:29:05] of the children hearts of children. I
[1:29:08] just believed it.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; It it was so obvious. any anything else.
[1:29:12] If anybody had tried to convince me that
[1:29:15] it was, you know, scripturally or
[1:29:17] technically or put all the scriptures
[1:29:19] together, I I would just said, "Get away
[1:29:21] from me. Just get away." I mean, this
[1:29:24] was the only thing I I said to people
[1:29:26] that were in in uh uh the upper realms
[1:29:29] of denominationalism. They they were
[1:29:31] challenging Malachi 4. Well, you've
[1:29:34] preached on Malachi 4. I said, "If I
[1:29:37] preached it about myself,
[1:29:39] it it it wouldn't bother you. It
[1:29:41] wouldn't bother you because it doesn't
[1:29:43] fit me." When he when he speaks it,
[1:29:46] people are disturbed because it fits
[1:29:48] him. Right.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; When the prophets gave their prophecy
[1:29:54] and the people who heard it knew they
[1:29:56] were prophets,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; that's why they slew them
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; and they said things that were just out
[1:30:02] of out of reason with the age that they
[1:30:05] were living in because the prophet even
[1:30:08] the word prophet is some he's telling
[1:30:10] something ahead of time.
[1:30:14] You know, I read a statement yesterday.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; I read a statement yesterday. I said to
[1:30:21] my wife, I'm going to read it to you. I
[1:30:22] never heard Brother Brandham say it. You
[1:30:25] talk about prophet. He said they'll
[1:30:28] there will come insects. He's talking
[1:30:30] about judgment. He says there'll come
[1:30:32] insects that haven't hatched yet.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Have you been listening to the news?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Children being born because of a certain
[1:30:41] mosquito. Where was this mosquito when I
[1:30:44] was a kid? Where was this mosquito 500
[1:30:47] years ago? There will come insects that
[1:30:50] haven't even hatched yet.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; And that kind of word and that kind of
[1:31:00] intelligence called you,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; called me.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; And then after he called, doesn't know
[1:31:08] what's going to happen. He knows every
[1:31:10] detail.
[1:31:15] Glory to God.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; He knows what you've been through.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; He knows all about the mud and the sin.
[1:31:21] And he knows all about the religion you
[1:31:24] got stuffed with.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And he in a moment of time, you can
[1:31:28] People have been stuffed with religion
[1:31:31] and with the trinity doctrine for
[1:31:34] decades and it leaves them in just a
[1:31:37] second.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Who does that? God almighty. Leaves
[1:31:40] them.
[1:31:42] God Almighty does that.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; And he saw your substance
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; before you came in the doors.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; He saw your substance when you were a
[1:31:52] little girl. Saw your substance when
[1:31:55] you're a little boy.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; And he guided that substance until that
[1:32:00] substance come in contact with eternal
[1:32:02] life.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And you received it.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; You received it then because you were
[1:32:08] ordained to receive it.
[1:32:10] and you were born again
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; into another kingdom
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; for another message
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; and you came down to this age
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; and you're sitting here in the seat
[1:32:21] today. You come down to this generation
[1:32:25] and I look and hear upon this I said
[1:32:27] then I'm going to look upon this
[1:32:29] congregation and these people came down
[1:32:32] to this age. Why did you come down to
[1:32:35] this age to hear what you're hearing?
[1:32:38] pay attention to what you're hearing and
[1:32:40] to declare that is a word of God to me.
[1:32:44] I'm going to embrace it. Others may not
[1:32:47] embrace it. I I am going to embrace this
[1:32:50] promise. I'm going to confess it
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to possess it
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; and I will let my life be the evidence
[1:33:01] of the unseen God.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; The God that spoke it. I will live that.
[1:33:08] to his glory.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Who's preaching in Long Beach? He said,
[1:33:23] "Here,
[1:33:24] wait a minute. A woman appeared here."
[1:33:29] He just g He just explained it a moment
[1:33:32] ago. A woman appeared here before me.
[1:33:36] Somebody praying
[1:33:38] neuritis
[1:33:40] eyes.
[1:33:41] I I didn't know about your neuritis, so
[1:33:44] I googled it. Yeah. And it talks about
[1:33:47] the eyes.
[1:33:49] Here's a man with a seventh grade. The
[1:33:51] substance had seventh grade Kentucky
[1:33:54] education.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; It's in Long Beach, California, years
[1:33:57] later. And he says, "A woman has
[1:33:59] appeared." Where did she appear?
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Appeared in wherever he was. He He went
[1:34:06] even to where they were.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; God who is timeless would take his
[1:34:11] messenger. Tell you what, friends, and
[1:34:14] don't get me wrong, but God came down.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; The God that brought you here,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; came down to call people's names. Came
[1:34:23] down to say the the God that was in
[1:34:25] Christ. He said, "I will be in you
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; and you will be in me
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; and the things that I do, you'll do."
[1:34:34] We don't get it done because we don't
[1:34:36] believe it
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; the way we ought to believe it.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; We We think come here and we think we
[1:34:42] come to church. You've not come here to
[1:34:44] church. You've not come here to hear
[1:34:47] somebody. I'm making an announcement to
[1:34:49] you that this God that called you, this
[1:34:52] God that ordained that you should hear
[1:34:54] this word, he's the one that's speaking
[1:34:56] to you now. It's not even this substance
[1:34:59] here. I give this substance to God
[1:35:02] himself.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; I prayed, God, send your word.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Send your word out. You still heal. Your
[1:35:10] word is exactly the same as it was in
[1:35:12] the time of Jesus. Deliver the people.
[1:35:15] Heal the people. Perform the unseen
[1:35:19] amongst us.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Can you believe it?
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; I see a little girl. I see a little man.
[1:35:28] I see a boy. and he comes on down to
[1:35:31] this age to hear this word.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Faith is the substance
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; of things hoped for,
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; the evidence of things unseen.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Your life will produce the evidence.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; You've been called to produce the
[1:35:48] evidence.
[1:35:58] I see a woman appeared.
[1:36:01] Somebody's praying.
[1:36:03] Neuritis
[1:36:05] eyes.
[1:36:07] The woman's got a red dress on. What's
[1:36:10] he doing? He's seeing it materialize.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And something's happened.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Nearitis
[1:36:17] eyes. She has a red dress on.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Where is that?
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; And the woman's sitting right here,
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; right there in front of him. But he he's
[1:36:30] he's busy. The thing is all
[1:36:32] materializing.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; That realm, friends,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; that's not some spooky place.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; That's not some place that's only
[1:36:41] accessed by one man.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; It was accessed by him. Don't get me
[1:36:47] wrong. We're not prophets. I'm not a son
[1:36:49] of a prophet. But you are here and
[1:36:53] testifying that God spoke to you. The
[1:36:56] invisible God spoke to you. It is that
[1:36:59] invisible God's responsibility to lead
[1:37:01] you. He said, "I will not leave you. I
[1:37:04] will guide you. I will comfort you.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; You are the redeemed of the Lord." And
[1:37:10] the redeemed of the Lord says so.
[1:37:15] Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; You have a human name.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; This intelligence knows your name.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; It said the woman's got a red dress on
[1:37:29] here. She sits right here. What
[1:37:33] happened? The vision just materialized
[1:37:36] to the present time. And the woman was
[1:37:38] sitting right there.
[1:37:42] You believe that he will heal you, Miss
[1:37:44] Curry?
[1:37:47] You believe he'll heal you? You believe
[1:37:50] he'll do what you've asked him to do,
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Miss Adama?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Do you think he will do what he will do?
[1:37:58] You think he'll do what he'll say,
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Sister Clement?
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; You believe he'll do it?
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; You believe he'll do it. Brother Daniel,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; he knows your name. Yes,
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; he knows your life.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; He comes into a message and I've spoken
[1:38:14] this many times, but maybe you didn't
[1:38:16] catch it and he starts a service with
[1:38:18] conference of God.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; I can tell you you could tell me a dream
[1:38:22] that you had perhaps years ago. How can
[1:38:25] you tell it? Because you lock back into
[1:38:27] your memory channel. If your memory
[1:38:30] channel can bring that, don't tell me
[1:38:32] that God by vision can't bring what he
[1:38:35] wants to bring. Yeah,
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; he can bring it from before you were
[1:38:39] birthed,
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; before you were conceived.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what he said to Jeremiah.
[1:38:45] Before you were conceived,
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; I knew you
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; before you came forth out of the womb.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; I declared you ordained you to be a
[1:38:55] prophet.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; And this is what will happen.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Even during his prophecy, he had to say,
[1:39:02] "I'll not speak it. I make too many
[1:39:05] enemies. I'm not going to say it. But he
[1:39:08] says, "But the word burned in my bones."
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; If you've been called here to this earth
[1:39:16] to be a witness, you can't keep quiet.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Even if you live it in silence, you must
[1:39:22] live it.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; You will live that life because your
[1:39:26] life, you have been sent here to declare
[1:39:29] the invisible God.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Do you receive that?
[1:39:33] Let me see your hands if you receive it.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "Then if you'll believe with
[1:39:47] all your heart, God will make you well.
[1:39:51] And if that's right, raise up your hand.
[1:39:53] There you are.
[1:39:55] I challenge you to believe it." He said,
[1:39:57] then he asked the question, "What is it?
[1:40:01] What is it?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; What is this quote that I've just given?
[1:40:05] What is it that was happening then? What
[1:40:07] is it that's happening now?
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; The same Lord God Almighty.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; He's He's answering what it is. You may
[1:40:18] say, "What is that?"
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; It's the Lord God Almighty.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; He's here
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; and he's indwelling human flesh.
[1:40:29] And he says two words. Hallelujah.
[1:40:31] Hallelujah.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; This invisible God is here.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; What is that? I see a woman. It's
[1:40:39] eyesight. It's neuritis.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; And I had to Google it and went on. What
[1:40:43] is neuritis? It's a disease of the eyes.
[1:40:45] And it goes on long explanations. Mayo
[1:40:48] Clinic is describing it. What is it,
[1:40:51] friends? What is this message? I ask
[1:40:54] this congregation of Cloverdale Bible
[1:40:56] Way and all who may be streaming, what
[1:40:58] is this message? Why are we here? Why
[1:41:01] are you living? Why do you have
[1:41:03] substance? God saw your substance coming
[1:41:07] here? God saw you before you were
[1:41:09] conceived and knew that you'd be here.
[1:41:12] Knew that you'd have a certain job.
[1:41:15] You'd enter a certain a certain
[1:41:17] education, a certain profession, or a
[1:41:19] certain labor. God knew exactly every
[1:41:22] detail and he watched it materialize
[1:41:25] from a boy in China, Josh. And he saw it
[1:41:29] and he saw it all materialize and come
[1:41:31] on down. And if he was describing and
[1:41:34] say one day he came and he heard at a
[1:41:37] school or he heard in a service and
[1:41:39] something spoke to your heart that was
[1:41:42] this invisible God and he sent his word
[1:41:46] so that you might declare it the
[1:41:48] invisible God to someone else.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. I can tell
[1:41:58] you if this congregation could get a
[1:42:01] hold of what I'm saying, there'd be
[1:42:03] things spontaneously happening as a
[1:42:06] prophet would say, if they would would
[1:42:08] believe it, the people, the whole
[1:42:10] congregation would be healed.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Or was he just
[1:42:14] saying that to be nice? No, he was
[1:42:17] saying that because that's the truth of
[1:42:20] God's word.
[1:42:25] and people who tried to believe it that
[1:42:27] was failing. All you have to do is just
[1:42:30] believe what was spoken.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; That's not hard. Don't stumble over the
[1:42:34] simplicity.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; It won't come. It won't work by
[1:42:39] knowledge. Just say he said it.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; He the invisible God has declared it.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And I believe that as a child I believe
[1:42:49] that.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Hello folks.
[1:42:54] Hello folks.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; We believe.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; We believe.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; He said it. We believe it.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; That's how it works.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; What if it doesn't happen today? He
[1:43:07] still said it.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; And I still believe it.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; And if necessary, I will die in the
[1:43:14] faith saying, "I believe it."
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:22] Let the people of the Lord say so.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; He is worthy
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; of all of your breath
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; and all of your praise.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; All of your worship.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel so filled. I feel as though
[1:43:39] I'd love to if I had a thousand tongues,
[1:43:42] if I could dance, I would dance before
[1:43:45] the Lord.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; What a meaning. What a message. What a
[1:43:50] time. Listen
[1:43:57] to me kids.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; You get on the internet
[1:44:03] or you get on with the devices that we
[1:44:05] have today. You see all kinds of things
[1:44:08] and make it so it's almost alive and see
[1:44:12] people fighting and shooting. It's a
[1:44:14] hoax,
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Doesn't exist.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; It's not there.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; In fact, it's a lie. It's a lie cuz it's
[1:44:21] not true. Those people aren't there.
[1:44:24] Those guns aren't firing. Those bombs
[1:44:26] aren't going off. The whole thing's a
[1:44:28] hoax. Don't spend your time on a hoax
[1:44:31] when you can have all of your time in
[1:44:33] something that's so real. There is
[1:44:35] another dimension. There is another
[1:44:37] place. Hallelujah. That knows your name.
[1:44:41] You believe it, Daniel. Hallelujah. He
[1:44:44] knew the substance would come here.
[1:44:46] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:44:50] Hallelujah. You believe it?
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let people become overcome.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Let's not be Let's not be ashamed of
[1:45:09] seeing women weep
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; and wash his feet with tears
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; and wipe his feet with the hairs of her
[1:45:17] head.
[1:45:19] may be disturbing to a nice supper
[1:45:21] dinner. We're not here for a nice supper
[1:45:23] dinner. We're here because we're
[1:45:25] believers.
[1:45:42] Glory.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Let it be.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Some say that's just emotionalism. Shame
[1:45:58] on you.
[1:46:00] Let people of the Lord
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; open your mouth and say, "My Jesus, I
[1:46:06] love you.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; My Savior, art thou?
[1:46:11] If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now."
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:46:25] And all that is within me.
[1:46:28] Praise his holy name.
[1:46:31] Praise his holy name.
[1:46:33] Do what you would do, oh God. Take
[1:46:36] control of this meeting. Take control of
[1:46:39] this substance. Let this substance give
[1:46:42] glory to God.
[1:46:47] Bless your name, oh God.
[1:46:50] Bless your name, oh God.
[1:46:53] I'm born a believer. I've been born
[1:46:56] again to believe.
[1:46:58] I've been born again to be the evidence
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; of this invisible God.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Just let God have his way.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[1:47:27] born to praise your name, Lord.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, we praise your holy name.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my Jesus, I love thee.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Why do we spontaneously
[1:47:56] Break out, brother Andrew. My Jesus, I
[1:47:59] love thee.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; My savior, I love thee. My Jesus, I love
[1:48:04] thee.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; For thee all the
[1:48:11] sin, I resign.
[1:48:13] If ever I love thee,
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; my Jesus is now.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[1:48:24] Hallelujah.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the almighty God
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; trying to witness to you.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Make this a reality.
[1:48:47] Let it be a reality, oh Lord.
[1:49:07] Hallelujah.
[1:49:24] Jesus.
[1:49:31] For the
[1:49:34] allies
[1:49:39] of sin,
[1:49:42] I reside. My mother.
[1:50:13] Jesus.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; I love
[1:50:27] with all expression now.
[1:50:34] You saw me Lord and worship
[1:50:40] my
[1:50:41] father.
[1:50:47] I thought you
[1:50:52] I love
[1:50:55] thee for
[1:51:01] the
[1:51:04] on I cry
[1:51:10] in
[1:51:13] I love
[1:51:18] my Jesus
[1:51:26] beside us.
[1:51:28] He's here. You can sense his presence.
[1:51:31] Angels are around.
[1:51:34] Angels are around surrounding
[1:51:37] the people
[1:51:40] surrounding this substance.
[1:51:43] God Almighty has told them go down stand
[1:51:46] around them.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; This is my redeemed.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; You angels are my servants but these are
[1:51:51] my redeemed.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; I purchased them
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; with my own beloved son.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:05] I'm so thankful today this
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; what God saw has materialized
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; and is here.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; You're here.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; The redeemer's here. The healer is here.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[1:52:39] Can I continue on just for a few
[1:52:41] moments?
[1:52:54] I've chosen several
[1:52:57] so that you can not deny
[1:53:00] it's not just one here, one there.
[1:53:03] through the scripture.
[1:53:08] God said to Jeremiah,
[1:53:11] "Before I formed in the belly, before
[1:53:15] I formed you in a belly
[1:53:19] and before you came forth out of the
[1:53:22] womb,
[1:53:24] before any of this happened, I
[1:53:26] sanctified you
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; and ordained you a prophet to the
[1:53:30] nations.
[1:53:34] Doesn't surprise me. Not for a moment
[1:53:38] that a boy heard
[1:53:40] a boy.
[1:53:43] If he'd have seen a vision of himself,
[1:53:46] he'd have seen a boy carrying
[1:53:49] water
[1:53:52] to a whiskey still. Still
[1:53:57] his father was an alcoholic.
[1:54:01] His father was a bootleger
[1:54:04] and the boy
[1:54:06] called of God
[1:54:09] ordained to be a prophets carrying
[1:54:11] water.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; In two buckets.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; He's not heard him yet. He's not seen
[1:54:16] him yet.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; But he's carrying water. Does that sound
[1:54:19] like you're a prophet? Does that sound
[1:54:21] like a ordained one of God carrying
[1:54:23] water that'll be turned into whiskey?
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:29] as God's elected
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; and thus a wind blew. And if he was
[1:54:34] seeing the vision, he would hear a wind
[1:54:36] and he would start to speak and say, "I
[1:54:38] see a boy."
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; I see a tree. He's near a tree.
[1:54:45] And the wind is rustling in the leaves
[1:54:47] of the tree.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; And now there's a voice. And the voice
[1:54:51] spoke to the boy.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. said, 'N never never drink or
[1:54:56] smoke or defile your body in any way.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; So when you're older, there's a work for
[1:55:01] you to do.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Many years later, and then the thing
[1:55:06] would materialize.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; So I see him here. Here he is standing
[1:55:11] behind the pullpit.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Here he is declaring the word of God.
[1:55:16] That's what the substance was ordained
[1:55:18] to do.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, I see you've had a lot of trouble.
[1:55:22] I've seen a lot of your friends have
[1:55:23] left you. I see you turning down a lot
[1:55:26] of money.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; I was ordained to do that.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; He told me about the check. $1.5 million
[1:55:36] because a man's wife was was healed from
[1:55:38] cancer.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Take it back." Said, "I"
[1:55:42] Well, they said, "We can't take it back.
[1:55:44] The FBI, they just needed to make sure
[1:55:47] they had the right person." and he
[1:55:50] showed him some ID and he said they he
[1:55:53] said take it back and tell him I thank
[1:55:55] him said we can't take it back it's
[1:55:57] already in the bank
[1:55:59] we're just here to make sure we have the
[1:56:01] right person
[1:56:03] and you are authorized the money's
[1:56:05] already in your account he says it drive
[1:56:08] me crazy I wouldn't know what to do with
[1:56:10] it
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; if he was seeing his own vision he say I
[1:56:13] see you're turning away from it
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; because the gift of God can't be sold
[1:56:18] Amen.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; The gift of God can't be bought.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; The gift of God, what is a million half
[1:56:26] dollars? It's nothing. It'll burn up in
[1:56:28] the fireplace might start a good fire,
[1:56:30] but I tell you what was in the bosom of
[1:56:32] this man will start a fire in the souls
[1:56:36] of individuals in the substance.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Before you were formed, said to
[1:56:46] Jeremiah,
[1:56:48] I ordained you
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; in conference with God.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Now you'll find this one
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; I listen to because I I just been
[1:57:00] determined I'm going to convey going to
[1:57:03] somehow get to these people get what
[1:57:06] it's like what this ministry is all
[1:57:08] about.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; This isn't my daddy's bigger than your
[1:57:11] daddy. Has nothing to do with that. My
[1:57:14] daddy happens to be father God Almighty.
[1:57:18] We have one father. You and I have one
[1:57:20] father. And that's our father. And he's
[1:57:23] in the invisible realm. And we needed
[1:57:26] some substance down here
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; in his extended mercy. Some substance
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; to see visions that we could understand
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; and speak of scripture so that we could
[1:57:38] understand it.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:45] And in this conference with God, he
[1:57:47] starts out
[1:57:50] talking about doctors.
[1:57:53] He said how kind, compassionate they
[1:57:56] are.
[1:57:58] He said trying to make life better for
[1:58:00] the people. He just talks. He doesn't
[1:58:03] talk like a minister. He just talking
[1:58:05] about doctors, how they try to make life
[1:58:09] better for the people.
[1:58:12] And then he preaches conference with God
[1:58:15] maybe an hour, hour and a half. Then
[1:58:18] they call a prayer line
[1:58:21] and the first one that comes the first
[1:58:23] one is standing there and you have to
[1:58:26] listen very carefully but you'll hear
[1:58:27] him say you believe it doctor
[1:58:33] and mother too. Uh-huh.
[1:58:37] said you're not from this city.
[1:58:41] You're not from this country. It was
[1:58:43] down in the States someplace.
[1:58:46] You come from another place. You come
[1:58:48] from Canada.
[1:58:52] Said you come from Vancouver.
[1:58:55] What kind of intelligence is that?
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Sister Ano, you nailed here.
[1:59:06] You didn't come from SFU.
[1:59:10] You didn't come from this country.
[1:59:13] You come from Africa.
[1:59:16] You come from
[1:59:18] Zimbabwe.
[1:59:21] He knew you before you were even
[1:59:23] conceived.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Your name is Anno.
[1:59:27] That's just how precise it was. I know
[1:59:29] that by a human knowledge. But now here
[1:59:32] he is talking to a doctor
[1:59:35] and he's in another realm.
[1:59:38] You're not from this city. You're not
[1:59:41] from this country.
[1:59:43] You're from Canada.
[1:59:47] Uh-huh. Vancouver.
[1:59:49] Uh-huh. But he says, "But you're not
[1:59:52] from Vancouver. You're from Finland."
[1:59:58] Hello.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; If that man had said, "No, I'm sorry.
[2:00:02] You're wrong. I'm from Texas."
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be here preaching.
[2:00:07] If he said, "No, I'm not from I'm not
[2:00:09] from Finland. I'm from Germany. I
[2:00:12] wouldn't be here preaching. That's how
[2:00:14] honest I am." And that and he was a
[2:00:16] hundred times a thousand times more
[2:00:18] honest than that. He stayed with that
[2:00:20] vision. What that vision said is what he
[2:00:23] said.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Then I begin to see something happen.
[2:00:27] Then I say, I begin to speak and I begin
[2:00:29] to speak and then then then it
[2:00:32] materialize. It comes down the person
[2:00:33] sitting right here.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] You believe it, don't you, James?
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Sister Joy, you believe it.
[2:00:43] We believe it.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; You believe it, Sean.
[2:00:47] You believe it, sister.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; To disbelieve is sin.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; I say, "Well, I'm tempted with this."
[2:01:00] And it and Satan would like to come
[2:01:01] around club you over the head. Oh, you
[2:01:04] thought these bad thoughts. You thought
[2:01:05] these things. Sorry, Satan.
[2:01:09] Sorry. You don't have any place here.
[2:01:11] You don't have any claim on me. I happen
[2:01:13] to be a believer.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; I may be human, but I happen to be a
[2:01:20] believer.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; I don't sit and let those evil birds
[2:01:24] nest in my hair.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; We're believers.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me shall be saved.
[2:01:35] He that believeth not is damned.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; What could be simpler than that?
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to close right away. I'm
[2:01:51] sorry. Holding it a little bit.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; I've got to abbreviate some things. You
[2:01:59] don't only He didn't only for me. You
[2:02:01] say, "Well, what I've been through." No,
[2:02:04] no. Let's let's forget what you've been
[2:02:06] through.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Let's forgive trials and hardships.
[2:02:16] I could keep you up here for a long time
[2:02:20] and tell you things.
[2:02:24] You kids get to play in a gym. I never
[2:02:27] saw the inside of a gym.
[2:02:33] You get to go to your room. I've never
[2:02:36] had a room.
[2:02:43] Never had a room.
[2:02:46] You've moved around the country. I moved
[2:02:50] 13, 14, 15, 16, about 17 times from the
[2:02:54] time I was eight to the time I was 15.
[2:03:02] But one time
[2:03:04] it did a hunger in my heart.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Did it hunger in my heart
[2:03:11] and I would read something.
[2:03:14] I'd read some scripture.
[2:03:16] I read a scripture. Can I give you this?
[2:03:20] I read a scripture. Strange scripture.
[2:03:24] If you remember it while I'm talking,
[2:03:26] you can raise your hand.
[2:03:28] and was uh Abraham.
[2:03:31] And the Lord said, he said, "What seed
[2:03:34] will you give me?"
[2:03:36] And he said, "What will you give me?"
[2:03:40] And he said, "Take a she I believe it
[2:03:44] was a she a he goat or a she goat,
[2:03:47] a ram. Take a ram. Take these animals
[2:03:52] and cut them in pieces
[2:03:54] and lay them out." and the turtle dove
[2:03:58] and the birds and don't divide them
[2:04:04] and and then the horror of darkness came
[2:04:06] through
[2:04:08] and then a light came a little light
[2:04:10] came through
[2:04:13] and while I would read that I'd start to
[2:04:15] weep
[2:04:17] and I would weep till I sobbed
[2:04:22] and I thought why am I crying
[2:04:27] And tears,
[2:04:29] big tears dropped on my Bible.
[2:04:32] And I thought, why is it every time
[2:04:37] I read this,
[2:04:40] something comes over me and I weep. It's
[2:04:43] very personal.
[2:04:46] I thought, why is that?
[2:04:48] And one day while I was reading the
[2:04:50] message, years later, I reading the
[2:04:52] message and brother Brandham refers to
[2:04:55] Abraham taking these animals out and God
[2:04:58] told him in a horror of darkness came
[2:05:00] through. He said, he said, "Well, maybe
[2:05:02] I'll just take a moment and explain
[2:05:04] that." Oh, I thought, "Please do. Please
[2:05:08] do. I want to know a part of my life."
[2:05:11] Yeah.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; And he says God was showing Abraham
[2:05:17] redemption.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; He was showing him Calvary.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Oh, that's why I was
[2:05:23] weeping.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; That's why tears came out of my eyes and
[2:05:26] fell on my Bible. He was showing Abraham
[2:05:29] redemption. I'm going to redeem your
[2:05:32] seed. I'm going to redeem them."
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; I was so thankful. So thankful that you
[2:05:40] have a messenger that
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; maybe years and years ago.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Brother David Laws.
[2:05:55] Brother David, you work for fitting
[2:05:57] tractor
[2:06:06] and for a time
[2:06:08] you just stand as a witness now for a
[2:06:10] few moments to the invisible God.
[2:06:15] That's why you came.
[2:06:18] That is why you're here. That's why you
[2:06:20] were put into a material substance body.
[2:06:24] that your only purpose in life
[2:06:27] is to get glory to God.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; This man
[2:06:37] because of difficult circumstances in
[2:06:39] his life
[2:06:41] was not able to hold a job
[2:06:45] and he had a wife sister Violet who's
[2:06:47] standing beside him or sitting beside
[2:06:49] him.
[2:06:50] Violet, would you like to stand this
[2:06:52] woman here?
[2:06:59] And they had a baby, a child.
[2:07:06] And that child,
[2:07:08] Brother David, called me one day in the
[2:07:12] church
[2:07:14] years ago.
[2:07:16] That same God is still living and is
[2:07:19] present here.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Said to Violet Brother David, the same
[2:07:23] one who did that. And he said, "Did I
[2:07:27] ever tell you how Brother Brandham spoke
[2:07:30] to me over the tape?
[2:07:33] Brother David had learned to be a spray
[2:07:35] painter,
[2:07:37] but he couldn't get a job.
[2:07:41] And he couldn't he didn't have any money
[2:07:42] hardly to live on.
[2:07:46] And he said to me, he said, I knew that
[2:07:48] a man must work and support his family.
[2:07:50] And I told God, I can't support my
[2:07:53] family. I must not have the Holy Ghost.
[2:07:57] He walks into his house full of despair.
[2:08:00] A little wee tiny place
[2:08:03] where this couple was. This man walked
[2:08:06] in,
[2:08:08] I won't say penniless, but nearly
[2:08:10] penniless.
[2:08:12] no job,
[2:08:15] a wife and a child that he can't
[2:08:17] support,
[2:08:20] can't get a job. He's been fired from
[2:08:22] several.
[2:08:24] Not because he was a bad worker. He was
[2:08:26] an excellent worker.
[2:08:31] He said, "I never did I ever tell you
[2:08:33] how Brother Brown spoke to me over
[2:08:35] tape."
[2:08:37] He said, "I walked into my house full of
[2:08:40] despair." He said, "I don't know why, if
[2:08:44] I'm wrong, Brother David, you can
[2:08:45] correct me, but you said you went into a
[2:08:48] closet and you picked out a white shirt
[2:08:51] that you had used for painting and there
[2:08:54] were specks of paint on it. Is that
[2:08:56] correct?
[2:09:00] You remember that?"
[2:09:02] He said, "I went into the front room and
[2:09:04] I sat down in a chair, just sat there
[2:09:07] full of discouragement and despair.
[2:09:10] There he is.
[2:09:14] I didn't know he was going to be here
[2:09:15] this morning. I didn't know this is
[2:09:16] unplanned.
[2:09:19] And he said, and I and I just turned on
[2:09:22] the tape. I just flicked the tape to
[2:09:24] play. I don't don't know what tape it
[2:09:26] was.
[2:09:27] I don't know anything about the tape. It
[2:09:29] just I knew Brother Brandham on the tape
[2:09:33] and the tape started playing
[2:09:35] and he had a healing line coming up or
[2:09:38] whatever and he's speaking from the
[2:09:41] platform and he's saying
[2:09:44] and he said another thing he said young
[2:09:47] man sitting down in that chair brother
[2:09:51] David doesn't know why he didn't sit in
[2:09:53] the sofa why he didn't sit he sat in oh
[2:09:56] like a kitchen chair and he sat in this
[2:09:59] chair with this white shirt on. And
[2:10:02] brother Brandham says, "Yes, you sitting
[2:10:03] in that chair." Yes. He said, "You with
[2:10:06] the white shirt
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; said, you need two thing. You have two
[2:10:09] things on your heart. And one is you
[2:10:13] need a job.
[2:10:15] And the other is you wonder if you have
[2:10:17] the Holy Spirit."
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; That's this man.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; That was the two questions on his heart.
[2:10:24] And I want you to know right after that
[2:10:25] he got a job with Finning Tractor and
[2:10:28] had it till he retired.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; I say this God
[2:10:34] saw a boy.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; He knew where the boy lived.
[2:10:40] He knew that boy would sit in a certain
[2:10:42] chair.
[2:10:44] He knew that he'd go into a closet and
[2:10:46] pick up a certain shirt.
[2:10:49] And that shirt, he doesn't know why he
[2:10:50] put it on, but it has that paint flex on
[2:10:53] it.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Why am I putting this shirt on? God made
[2:10:56] you put that on, brother David. Because
[2:10:59] God was going to speak from another
[2:11:01] realm and say, "I know that boy." And he
[2:11:04] come down now. He sits right here in
[2:11:06] this chair and a prophet speaks to you.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother David, Sister Violet.
[2:11:12] I'm so thankful you're here.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; You're here as a witness to this
[2:11:16] invisible God. And the devil's lying to
[2:11:20] you. Don't tell him. Don't give him any
[2:11:22] credit. He's a liar.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; And the deliverance, this word comes
[2:11:27] with deliverance.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; This word comes with the power of heaven
[2:11:31] behind it.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; I say glory to God.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Let the congregation of the Lord give
[2:11:38] him glory.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:11:42] forever.
[2:11:57] Glory to God.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:12:00] So God said
[2:12:03] through Isaiah, he's not just a
[2:12:04] character, but God said through Isaiah,
[2:12:06] so
[2:12:08] we are all as an unclean thing
[2:12:12] and of all of our righteousness is as
[2:12:14] filthy rags.
[2:12:16] And we do all we all do fade
[2:12:21] as a leaf. And our iniquities like the
[2:12:24] wind have taken us away. And there is
[2:12:28] none that calleth upon thy name. That
[2:12:31] sounds pretty
[2:12:33] pretty
[2:12:35] sad.
[2:12:37] That stirth up himself none that stirth
[2:12:39] up himself to take hold of thee. For
[2:12:42] thou has hid thy face from us and hast
[2:12:45] consumed us because of our iniquities.
[2:12:48] But now, oh Lord.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Are you saying that? But now, Lord,
[2:12:54] these things have been I've been like a
[2:12:56] leaf that's withered on a branch. I've
[2:12:58] been dry. My white righteousness is as
[2:13:01] filthy rags. Listen friends, the fact
[2:13:04] that you come to church and we do the
[2:13:06] duties of life that we're not heroes
[2:13:09] because of that. But now, oh Lord, thou
[2:13:12] art father. Thou art our father, and we
[2:13:17] are the clay.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; And thou our potter, not a potter.
[2:13:23] You're our potter. You're my potter. I
[2:13:26] am your clay.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Do you feel that way?
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; And we all are the work of thy hands.
[2:13:43] said through Jeremiah. The vessel that
[2:13:44] had been made of clay was marred in the
[2:13:48] hand of the potter. So he made it again,
[2:13:51] another vessel as seemed good to the
[2:13:54] potter
[2:13:56] to make it.
[2:13:59] Oh, I tell you friends, and
[2:14:02] the apostle Paul picked it up. Hath not
[2:14:05] the potter power over the clay,
[2:14:09] over the same lump, to make something to
[2:14:12] honor, to dishonor. Doesn't he have
[2:14:14] power? I just say to the church today,
[2:14:17] hasn't the potter power over the clay?
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; You got a disappointment? You think he's
[2:14:22] got power over the clay?
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Now, father,
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; you're the potter.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; I'm the clay.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, father,
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; you saw it wasn't my mother and dad that
[2:14:36] decided determined to have a child. They
[2:14:38] didn't know I'd be a boy or a girl. But
[2:14:41] God did.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; And sent a prophet. I see a little girl.
[2:14:46] I see a child. I see a life
[2:14:48] materializing.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; God saw your life.
[2:14:54] Oh, if I could get sit down with you
[2:14:56] face to face and tell you God saw your
[2:14:58] life when it was materializing
[2:15:01] before father knew mother knew anything
[2:15:03] about it. God saw the life materializing
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; and then it came on down. Then he saw a
[2:15:10] little girl. What did God do, friends?
[2:15:13] What did God do? God gave you a personal
[2:15:15] messenger
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; to explain how he sees things.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; This is how God sees things.
[2:15:26] I have had a personal messenger sent
[2:15:28] from God to tell me even how I got here.
[2:15:41] friends,
[2:15:43] don't ever declare yourself to having
[2:15:46] been
[2:15:47] well, I'm of this
[2:15:50] I'm I'm of this clan or of this group or
[2:15:54] of this organization or this country or
[2:15:58] we we're strangers.
[2:16:01] That's right.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; And pilgrims,
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; we don't belong here.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; We're from another kingdom.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; You're from another place.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Listen to me now. This messenger, this
[2:16:19] personal messenger has told you and I,
[2:16:22] he said, "This has not been done. I have
[2:16:26] it here, but I haven't come. This has
[2:16:28] not been done for 2,000 years.
[2:16:32] He said the He said the Old Testament
[2:16:35] was the husband
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; and the saints back there fulfilled
[2:16:40] that.
[2:16:41] And he says the bride will fulfill the
[2:16:45] New Testament.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; And the New Testament ends with amen at
[2:16:50] the end of Revelation.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; And the New Testament says, "Come to the
[2:16:55] seventh messenger. I'll show you the
[2:16:57] brow. I'll show you the lamb's wife.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; That's a promise for us to embrace.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; I'm part of that
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; and I confess it and I hold to it and I
[2:17:12] see that promise maybe a far off. That's
[2:17:15] my promise. That's why I came here in
[2:17:19] substance to give glory. Who spoke that?
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:17:27] Glory, glory, glory.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; we want to sing some praise and worship
[2:17:44] to you.
[2:17:48] We praise you. We pray you'll receive
[2:17:51] our praise and thanksgiving
[2:17:54] as the people have received your word.
[2:17:58] Send forth your word, oh God.
[2:18:01] You will do so. The word is gone.
[2:18:05] You will heal and deliver and shackles
[2:18:06] will fall.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; People's minds will be renewed.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; You'll take away, oh God, all the
[2:18:14] dullness
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; and all the weariness of this life.
[2:18:17] you'll take it away. Let it dissipate,
[2:18:20] oh God. And to those that are streaming,
[2:18:23] I feel just now to call and pray for
[2:18:26] them. I pray that you will do something
[2:18:29] in a very special manner. Do something,
[2:18:31] oh God. Let our minds of the people here
[2:18:34] remain focused. Oh father, but those
[2:18:38] that are in need. You will even send
[2:18:40] your word. You see the wounded ones and
[2:18:43] you see the healed ones and you see the
[2:18:46] rejoicing ones. Oh God, receive glory
[2:18:49] and the and the promises we embrace. You
[2:18:52] have said we shall not all sleep but we
[2:18:55] shall be changed.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; That is our promise.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; You have said that. We have heard it
[2:19:01] many times. But you have spoken it and
[2:19:04] it shall materialize.
[2:19:10] Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[2:19:15] I'm a new creation. Brother Brian,
[2:19:22] let's stand.
[2:19:33] If you believe and experience,
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; sing it as a redeemed.
[2:19:44] Oh, I
[2:19:46] thank God he justify
[2:19:50] me
[2:19:53] by his
[2:19:56] we
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; more than a storm now. More than a song.
[2:20:15] I've been born. Look back and think
[2:20:18] about the time
[2:20:23] of a song.
[2:20:28] I'm a new creation.
[2:20:33] I'm a brand new man. I'm a new creation.
[2:20:37] I'm a new creation.
[2:20:42] I'm a brand new man, brand new woman,
[2:20:45] brand new
[2:20:47] pass away.
[2:20:50] I born again
[2:20:54] more than a coner.
[2:21:12] You know there's a lot of people didn't
[2:21:13] rejoice even when the prophet himself
[2:21:16] even when Jesus himself
[2:21:20] it's not what's being said
[2:21:25] it's what's being believed.
[2:21:30] The prophet himself said, "Miss Curry
[2:21:33] calls another woman, said she's missing
[2:21:36] it."
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; And then he finally said, "She's missed
[2:21:39] it.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; That's not us.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; That's not for That's not why I preach.
[2:21:45] I preach that you'll get it.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; Make it so real till you'll get it.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; This word's for me."
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; He is alive and he's here present. I've
[2:21:57] heard it before, but it's different now.
[2:22:00] He's here, present. You're here. I'm
[2:22:02] embracing you with the promise. I'm
[2:22:05] embracing the promise.
[2:22:07] Hallelujah. I love the promise. You love
[2:22:10] it, brother David. Hallelujah.
[2:22:15] What are these people? I see a boy. I
[2:22:18] see a life
[2:22:20] and it materializes.
[2:22:24] You want that quote.
[2:22:27] It materializes.
[2:22:30] I see a girl.
[2:22:34] Something happens.
[2:22:38] She's wearing a red dress.
[2:22:41] Oh, here she is right here.
[2:22:46] Say, "That sounds mystic." That's
[2:22:47] exactly. He said, "And the people of God
[2:22:50] live in a place alone with God and
[2:22:53] they're mystics to the world." And I
[2:22:55] say, "Glory to God." Hallelujah. I want
[2:22:59] I don't want this old world fictitious
[2:23:02] and bony as can be. You talk about gloss
[2:23:05] and a bunch of Hollywood and nonsense.
[2:23:08] And we don't want to be swept away with
[2:23:10] just emotionalism in a in a glorified
[2:23:14] Hollywood presentation. That's not what
[2:23:16] it is. This is oldfashioned gospel.
[2:23:21] This is the oldfashioned Jesus Christ.
[2:23:25] Hallelujah.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; This may not be the popular way, but
[2:23:29] this is the way.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; He is the way, the truth, and he was
[2:23:34] rejected. We may be rejected, but that
[2:23:36] doesn't change anything. Are you with me
[2:23:39] while I continue to preach?
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; That's why I say hallelujah.
[2:23:50] He saw you
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; before you came
[2:23:55] before you came here. Brother Gilbert,
[2:23:58] you came here for this purpose.
[2:24:03] You out there, each of you, he knows
[2:24:07] exactly your name.
[2:24:09] I say you're coming down.
[2:24:15] You come right down to this age.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; He ordained that you would be here
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; in this service
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; to hear these things
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; and to go out of this building
[2:24:31] transformed by the transforming power.
[2:24:36] The scripture,
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; the Bible, the words of God, they have a
[2:24:42] certain imbred characteristic in them to
[2:24:44] cause you to believe.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; It will cause you to believe.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; This kind of preaching should make
[2:24:54] anybody believe.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; If this congregation believes, all
[2:25:00] things are possible.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[2:25:06] Glory to God.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; He'll move every demon power. He'll move
[2:25:11] every government. Hallelujah. He'll move
[2:25:14] every situation and institution
[2:25:17] to his glory and his will.
[2:25:20] To God be the glory.
[2:25:22] Hallelujah.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; I just the just couple things on my
[2:25:33] mind.
[2:25:34] I want to sing with you. Sometime I
[2:25:36] don't sing because of you. I sing
[2:25:40] because of me. It's not being selfish,
[2:25:43] but I just want to sing. I'm one of
[2:25:46] them.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Tell the world I'm one of them.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; We're not whimpers. We didn't we we we
[2:25:57] didn't come here to whimper.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; We came here to glorify God.
[2:26:01] There's no device that's formed against
[2:26:05] thee that shall prosper. Do you believe
[2:26:08] it? There's no device. There's no
[2:26:11] economic device. There's no work device.
[2:26:14] There's nothing. There's no device.
[2:26:18] Satan has not got an invention that can
[2:26:20] suck you in.
[2:26:22] In fact, I have an invention that from
[2:26:25] God that will break every feather. We
[2:26:28] have a Holy Spirit within. We have a
[2:26:30] secret power to break every fatter.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; Fact is, I have it right here. The
[2:26:41] prophets in Chicago, many people have
[2:26:44] come around the front.
[2:26:46] He speaks such a rebuke. If he spoke
[2:26:50] that in this church, it would hurt us.
[2:26:53] He spoke such a rebuke. He said, "What's
[2:26:55] the matter with you Pentecostal people?"
[2:26:58] said, "Shame on you."
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; Because of the things that happened, he
[2:27:02] was calling out the people. Called out
[2:27:04] many, many, many. Just couldn't hardly
[2:27:07] get them out fast enough. And he called
[2:27:09] the people forward to repent. And
[2:27:11] ministers came and so on so forth.
[2:27:16] But he said, he said, "You may see me. I
[2:27:20] draw my hands back and then I put them
[2:27:22] out forward and lay lay my hands on the
[2:27:24] people." He said, "I'm doing that
[2:27:27] because he said visions are breaking out
[2:27:30] all over the congregation
[2:27:32] and healings and supernatural things are
[2:27:35] taking place." And when I see it taking
[2:27:37] place out there, I lay my hands on these
[2:27:40] people that they might partake of the
[2:27:42] same thing.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory be to God."
[2:27:48] Thank God for that insight. There's
[2:27:51] faith out there.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; There's faith out there. There's faith
[2:27:54] down here.
[2:27:57] We come to church to see things happen,
[2:27:59] friends.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Not just to hear preaching, but things
[2:28:02] happen for you.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Let the Hallelujah
[2:28:09] roll.
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; The Hallelujah roll. Let me sing my
[2:28:16] Savior's praises far and wide for I've
[2:28:18] opened up toward Jesus. All the I'm in a
[2:28:22] different song now, but that's all
[2:28:23] right. You know the song there. Know the
[2:28:26] song, Brother Ryan.
[2:28:29] Oh, I think it's Yeah.
[2:28:53] Hallelujah.
[2:28:56] Oh
[2:28:58] Jesus.
[2:29:02] Sing my single.
[2:29:18] Heat. Heat.
[2:29:41] I'm one of them. One of them. I'm so
[2:29:43] glad I can say I'm one of them.

[2:30:36] Heat. Heat.
[2:30:46] Praise
[2:30:48] God.
[2:31:15] declar.
[2:31:24] I can see what a man
[2:31:40] I feel kind of lonesome when I'm
[2:31:42] standing here and we sing that chorus
[2:31:44] and I say, "Praise God, I want I want as
[2:31:47] many as feel like joining
[2:31:50] join me when we say that one of them.
[2:31:57] Praise God.
[2:32:00] I can say
[2:32:06] hallelujah.
[2:32:12] Heat. Heat.
[2:32:22] Heat.
[2:32:26] Heat.
[2:32:36] Heat. Heat.
[2:32:56] Heat. Heat.
[2:33:23] Hallelujah.
[2:33:28] Magnify
[2:33:30] God.
[2:33:32] Hallelujah.
[2:33:35] Hallelujah.
[2:33:38] filled with thanksgiving.
[2:33:40] We love one another.
[2:33:43] Father David, I'm so happy you're here.
[2:33:46] God created this substance for that
[2:33:48] purpose.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; God created your substance.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; You that are here in the platform, he
[2:33:53] created our substance for that very
[2:33:56] purpose.
[2:33:59] Brother Tom, why don't you ask a
[2:34:00] blessing upon the people?
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Next Sunday, there's no service
[2:34:06] here in the morning,
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; right? It's all at the camp,
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; but there will be in there.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Those that can't make it to camp.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Those that can't make it to camp,
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; we'll have the fellowship room.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; The fellowship room will be open and
[2:34:18] we'll live stream. We'll be live
[2:34:20] streaming from the camp for those that
[2:34:22] can't cross the border. We're going to
[2:34:24] accommodate everybody.
[2:34:26] Hallelujah.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; So pray that lifech changing power will
[2:34:31] come upon each of them.
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Tom, as you
[2:34:36] pray. And tonight,
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Kyle Morton,
[2:34:44] Brother Kyle, we love your ministry.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; You have absolute liberty.
[2:34:58] And we love Brother Bisl's ministry.
[2:35:01] Amen.
[2:35:17] Let us pray. Heavenly Father, what can
[2:35:19] we say this morning but how much we love
[2:35:21] your word.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; Word has come alive to us Lord and
[2:35:25] heaven has come down. Our spirits have
[2:35:27] been just thrilled Lord to hear thus
[2:35:30] sayaith the word of God. to thank Lord
[2:35:33] that we have finally found out. Hebrews
[2:35:36] 1, Hebrews 11:1, by faith
[2:35:40] this substance
[2:35:42] has been declared.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Before Lord, it was even in our mothers
[2:35:48] and our father's minds. We were found in
[2:35:50] the mind of God. And sub faith is the
[2:35:54] substance of things hoped for, the
[2:35:56] evidence of things not seen. And Lord,
[2:35:59] we heard we could hear about Abraham. We
[2:36:02] could hear about Moses by faith and Noah
[2:36:04] by faith. But the wonderful part, Lord,
[2:36:07] that they without us are not made
[2:36:09] perfect.
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; The New Testament
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; without that Old Testament, the New
[2:36:14] Testament without us,
[2:36:17] they are not made perfect.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; So God, may the faith of Abraham, Isaac,
[2:36:22] and Jacob, Lord, be our faith this
[2:36:24] morning.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Our faith is raised up to another realm.
[2:36:28] and we're thankful for it. Strengthen
[2:36:30] your servant. May this word become alive
[2:36:33] to each and every one of us realizing we
[2:36:35] have a part to play.
[2:36:38] And so Lord, our hearts are indeed
[2:36:41] thrilled. And would you go with us? May
[2:36:43] the presence of God surround us. May
[2:36:46] this word of God come alive to us. And
[2:36:49] Lord, as the pastor is saying just at
[2:36:51] the end, it's just not what's being said
[2:36:53] and people not hearing. It's the people
[2:36:56] believing. And we want to say we are the
[2:36:58] believers that are believing by faith.
[2:37:01] Go with us now Lord under this blessing
[2:37:04] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you
[2:37:07] saints. Come with this presence. Bring
[2:37:09] the Lord Jesus Christ with you. We'll
[2:37:12] have a wonderful time one more time. God
[2:37:14] bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:37:16] name. Amen.
[2:37:45] down.
[2:37:48] Heat.
[2:38:16] Heat. Heat.
[2:40:05] Heat. Heat.
[2:40:15] Holy Spirit.
[2:40:43] Heat. Heat.
[2:40:54] Come on.
[2:41:09] Heat.
