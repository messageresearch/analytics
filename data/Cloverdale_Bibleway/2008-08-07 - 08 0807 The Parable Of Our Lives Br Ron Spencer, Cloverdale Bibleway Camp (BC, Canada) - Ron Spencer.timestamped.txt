[0:37] have never been. camp on this. We had
[0:40] camp here seven years, but it's quite a
[0:42] few years ago. And how many of the
[0:44] campers that are here now that never
[0:47] have been on this camp? Never been here
[0:49] on this camp. I want you to stand up.
[0:51] Never been in the camp.
[0:54] It's their first time in the camp. All
[0:57] right. Wonderful. Wonderful. I wonder uh
[1:01] you can sit down. And how many adults
[1:03] here, how many have been here and have
[1:06] come here as campers? You have been
[1:09] campers here. You've grown up. Now
[1:11] you're not allowed to come anymore, but
[1:13] you try to do everything you can. You
[1:15] say, "Can I be a counselor? Can I work
[1:17] in the kitchen? Can I wash dishes? Can I
[1:20] sweep floors? Can I put up the tent? Can
[1:22] I do anything, please, but just let me
[1:24] come to the camp?" Uh, and you you've
[1:26] you've used all those tactics and we've
[1:28] let all kinds of you come. So, how many
[1:30] have come here to the camp and now
[1:32] you're adults and but you you have been
[1:35] here in this camp. Let's have you stand.
[1:38] Look at all these old people stand.
[1:42] Well, that's wonderful, too. And there's
[1:45] a lot that haven't been here at all.
[1:46] Well, I tell you that. That's wonderful.
[1:49] Well, we're in for a great time. We're
[1:52] ready here to hear the word of God. And
[1:55] thank you all for coming. And thank you
[1:58] for those of you that have been praying.
[2:00] You prayed.
[2:02] God has heard. And now we're going to
[2:05] begin receiving some answers.
[2:08] You believe that? Is that wonderful? Uh
[2:12] I I'd like to just maybe have you stand
[2:14] and sing uh
[2:18] brother. I'd like to sing born again.
[2:21] All because of
[2:24] me.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:40] born again. There's really been a change
[2:44] in me.
[2:48] Born again just like Jesus.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Lift it up to him now.
[2:56] born again
[2:59] because of Calary.
[3:04] I'm glad so glad that I' been
[3:11] &gt;&gt; I've been born again. There's really
[3:15] been a change in me.
[3:20] Born again
[3:22] just like Jesus said.
[3:28] Born again and all because of Calary.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad so glad that I've been
[3:39] born again.
[3:49] you love the Lord this evening.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; I am grateful to be here.
[3:55] Thank you for the applause to the Lord.
[3:58] And we just know that it's absolutely
[4:00] supernatural that I'm just able to be
[4:02] here this year. And uh
[4:07] when I was asked to come to the camp, I
[4:10] was in a coma.
[4:15] That's right.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; The doctors were saying something
[4:28] completely different than what brother
[4:29] Ed was saying and what God was saying.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; They were saying I was going to die and
[4:35] he was saying I was going to live
[4:37] &gt;&gt; and not only live but I would stand here
[4:40] tonight.
[4:41] by the resurrection power of Jesus
[4:45] Christ.
[4:56] I'm so happy to have my family with me,
[4:59] my mother and my father and and my my
[5:02] children. It just it just you just don't
[5:05] hardly believe how how almost my heart
[5:08] wants to just explode to to have them
[5:10] with me. And so we're so thrilled to be
[5:13] here and such a warm reception and we
[5:16] love you with all of our hearts and and
[5:18] we're looking forward as well to what
[5:20] God would do in these meetings for them,
[5:23] &gt;&gt; for myself and for you.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray just now. Lord Jesus,
[5:30] we know just to step to this pull pit
[5:33] tonight was saw by God.
[5:40] Last July when I stood and I preached
[5:44] that Satan couldn't touch a hair of my
[5:46] head
[5:47] &gt;&gt; until he first got permission from my
[5:50] father.
[5:52] Little did we know that this last year
[5:54] would take us through a dark,
[5:58] dark valley.
[6:00] But in the midst of it, you showed us a
[6:02] glimmer of light
[6:05] and it was whispered into my ears even
[6:09] in a coma that I would be speaking this
[6:13] meeting.
[6:14] And Lord Jesus, I thank you for this
[6:17] day. I'm almost overwhelmed
[6:20] within my own being. I'm trembling,
[6:24] not from nerves, but from the power of
[6:27] the Holy Spirit.
[6:29] And Lord, I pray that that would be
[6:31] conveyed into words tonight.
[6:34] May you use this oracle tonight and may
[6:38] as this week progresses, Father, may you
[6:40] give us a temporary resurrection
[6:43] through which that you would speak
[6:45] through us.
[6:46] Lord, you see the hungry hearts tonight
[6:49] and you see souls that are imbalances
[6:52] and you see where they are just now. I
[6:56] pray that you would bless Brother Ed and
[6:58] Brother Tom and all the ministries of
[6:59] this congregation, every worker. You see
[7:02] every minute that they labored to bring
[7:05] this camp together. Lord, you see all
[7:07] the days and the hours and the months
[7:09] that they've worked. Lord, that might
[7:12] been looked over by many, but you have
[7:14] not looked over it. And you're a
[7:17] rewarder. And I pray that tonight that
[7:19] you would speak to our hearts. And may
[7:22] we step into heavenly places just now.
[7:26] May you come and help us tonight. And
[7:28] may we be fully aware that you're the
[7:30] one that speaks.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[7:34] And amen. If you will turn with me into
[7:37] your scriptures this afternoon to Psalms
[7:41] 139.
[7:45] I would like to thank brother Ed for
[7:47] this wonderful invitation and brother
[7:51] Tom
[7:56] all the other ministries here.
[8:11] So glad to have sister Connie.
[8:14] Amen.
[8:16] I appreciate your prayers for her as
[8:18] well. I slept through the whole trauma
[8:20] and she prayed through the whole trauma.
[8:24] Amen.
[8:28] David is pouring his heart out to God.
[8:31] Oh Lord, thou searches hast search me
[8:34] and known me.
[8:36] Thou knowest my downsings and my
[8:38] uprising.
[8:40] Thou understandest my thought a far off.
[8:43] Thou compasseth my path and my lying
[8:45] down, and are acquainted with all of my
[8:48] ways, and there is not a word in my
[8:51] tongue. But, oh L, oh Lord, thou knowest
[8:55] it all together. Thou hast beset me
[8:58] behind and before, and laid thine hand
[9:01] upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful
[9:05] for me. It is high, and I cannot attain
[9:08] unto it. Whether shall I go from thy
[9:11] spirit or whether shall I flee from thy
[9:13] presence? If I ascend up into the mount
[9:16] into the heavens, thou art there. And if
[9:19] I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art
[9:22] there. And if I take the wings of the
[9:24] morning and dwell in the uttermost parts
[9:26] of the sea, even there shall thy hand
[9:29] lead me, and thy right hand shall hold
[9:31] me. And if I say, Surely the darkness
[9:34] shall cover me, even the night shall the
[9:37] light be about me. Yay, the darkness
[9:39] hideth not from thee, but the night
[9:41] shineth as the day, and the darkness the
[9:43] light are both a light to thee. For thou
[9:47] possesseth my reigns. Thou hast covered
[9:49] me in thy mother's womb. And I will
[9:52] praise thee, for I am fearfully and
[9:54] wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy
[9:56] works,
[9:58] and that my soul knoweth right well. My
[10:01] substance is not hid from thee. And when
[10:04] I was made in secret and curiously
[10:06] wrought in the lowest parts of the
[10:08] earth, thine eyes did see my substance,
[10:10] yet being imperfect, and in and in thy
[10:13] book are all my members were written,
[10:15] which is continuence were fashioned.
[10:18] When as yet there was none of them. How
[10:20] precious also are thy thoughts unto me,
[10:23] oh God. How great is the sum of them,
[10:26] and if I should count them, they are
[10:29] more in number than in sand. When I
[10:31] awake, I am still with thee.
[10:36] You may be seated this evening.
[10:47] I would like to start out tonight and
[10:50] and just kind of draw you into to some
[10:53] thoughts that the Lord has just laid on
[10:54] my heart.
[10:56] I would like
[10:59] to look at the parable of our lives
[11:03] and and I would just I would like to I
[11:07] would like to take it in two different
[11:09] directions.
[11:10] First of all, and I I I actually
[11:14] actually actually planned to get away
[11:16] from Brother Ed for a couple of days. He
[11:19] didn't know it. But I when I asked him
[11:21] coming from the airport the other day, I
[11:23] we were just talking and and I said,
[11:25] "What did you preach Sunday?" And he
[11:27] said, "I preached on the book of life
[11:28] and the Lamb's book of life." And I
[11:31] thought, "Oh Lord, how can I follow
[11:33] that?" And here I am standing tonight
[11:36] and I'm going to discuss our book of
[11:39] life and our lamb's book of life.
[11:43] But it only allowed me to let me know
[11:45] that God is in complete control of
[11:47] everything.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; When we begin to look at a great
[11:52] patriarch like David and and the book of
[11:54] Hebrews and we begin to look at these
[11:56] men, sometimes we look at him when we
[11:59] think within ourselves, we think there's
[12:01] no way that we can compare to them. And
[12:04] we realize very quickly that every one
[12:07] of them were were human beings just like
[12:09] you and I. And we realize that we came
[12:13] and every person that comes upon the
[12:15] earth is their names is in the book of
[12:18] life. And and we realize that every
[12:20] person that ever breathes, they go in
[12:22] there and as a record begins and their
[12:24] their life begins and and they begin to
[12:27] go through some things of their life and
[12:29] they don't understand. Brother Brandham
[12:31] makes some statements. He said, "Maybe
[12:33] you just staggered into a meeting and
[12:35] you know," he said, "but it wasn't it
[12:37] wasn't by accident that God brought you
[12:40] here." And he begins to tell you that
[12:42] you were pre-planned by God.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; And your names were written on the
[12:48] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[12:51] foundation of the world.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; Just a couple of statements that you're
[12:54] very familiar with. Brother Bram says
[12:56] that God took a picture of you at your
[12:59] best before the foundation of the world.
[13:03] And and we know that God had us on his
[13:06] mind. And he begins to project us and
[13:09] and he begins to look for us and he
[13:11] knows the way that we're going to come
[13:13] from it. And David begins to be very
[13:15] honest in Psalms 139. And he begins to
[13:19] realize that God is an omnipotent God.
[13:22] God is an all knowing God. and he
[13:25] realizes that no matter what he does, he
[13:28] cannot cover himself up. He has a lot of
[13:32] weaknesses. He has a lot of dark places
[13:35] in his life. He's been through a lot of
[13:37] valleys in his life. And he realizes,
[13:40] God, when I was in the valleys, thou art
[13:43] there.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; When I was having extremely great places
[13:48] in my life, thou was there.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; And he realizes that even while I when I
[13:53] was made in wrought in secret that was
[13:57] there.
[13:58] Brother Brandham says this in why Christ
[14:00] speak. He said he said that's the reason
[14:03] the very purpose that Jesus came here to
[14:07] the earth was to serve those that God
[14:09] through his fornowledge
[14:11] seen and he wanted to be saved. He said
[14:14] because the whole earth was condemned
[14:17] and he said I don't know how that we
[14:19] could teach it any other way than to
[14:22] than the fornowledge of God. And the
[14:24] Bible plainly says that he knows the end
[14:28] from the beginning and could tell it.
[14:30] And he says, "Therefore, when a person
[14:32] tries to be something that they're not,"
[14:35] he says they're only making an
[14:37] impersonation and sooner or later you'll
[14:40] find it out.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; And he says, he says, "And your sins
[14:46] finds you out." So, we're realizing
[14:49] brother Brandham is beginning to make
[14:51] these statements and they don't sound
[14:52] very complex, but if we could only catch
[14:55] them and if really we're only trying to
[14:57] be an actor, God knows.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; And if we're only impersonate something,
[15:02] God knows. And if we're only going to
[15:05] church and we're running through the
[15:06] meal, GOD KNOWS THAT. BUT GOD ALSO KNOWS
[15:10] where you're living at.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; He knows where you're living at. He's
[15:16] very strategic. He's very accurate. He
[15:19] was very in this end time, he was very
[15:21] strategic and accurate to tell people
[15:23] exactly where they lived, exactly what
[15:26] their address was, exactly what their
[15:29] conditions was.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Backsliding, WANTING A REVIVAL IN THEIR
[15:34] CHURCH, the condition, the doctors, THE
[15:36] AFFLICTIONS. GOD KNEW ALL of that, but
[15:38] he was only letting his people know. I
[15:40] know that.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; SO GOD KNOWS THE END FROM THE BEGINNING.
[15:46] AND HE SAID, "THEREFORE, a tr a person
[15:49] that they're not. They're only making an
[15:51] impersonation and sooner or later you'll
[15:54] find it out. YOUR SINS WILL FIND YOU
[15:56] OUT. YOU CANNOT COVER THEM." He says,
[15:58] "And there's only one covering FOR SIN
[16:01] AND THAT'S THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST."
[16:04] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THAT'S NOT AN OLD STORY.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT A FAMILIAR STORY. THAT'S AN
[16:10] UPTO-DATE STORY TONIGHT.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He says, "And it cannot be applied
[16:15] unless GOD HAS CALLED YOU FROM THE
[16:18] FOUNDATION of the world."
[16:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother, I want to be a
[16:22] Christian. I want to do this and I want
[16:23] to do this." No man can come to him
[16:26] EXCEPT THE SPIRIT OF GOD DRAWS him
[16:28] first.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; And listen, JUST TO FEEL THE TUG OF GOD
[16:32] ON YOUR HEART. THIS, LISTEN, IS A
[16:34] MIRACLE.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "OH, BROTHER, I I FELT GOD
[16:39] COME." THAT'S A MIRACLE.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; THAT WITHIN ITSELF IS A MIRACLE. And
[16:44] never overlook THAT
[16:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S BILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN
[16:47] THE EARTH THAT GOD NEVER TUGS ON THEIR
[16:50] HEARTS,
[16:56] &gt;&gt; better jobs, better education, bigger
[16:59] churches.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[17:04] &gt;&gt; COMPLEX MINDS ANOINTED. THEY CAN SING,
[17:07] they can preach, THEY CAN DO ALL
[17:08] DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS. BUT GOD
[17:10] CALLED YOU.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; And never overlook that. NEVER ALLOW
[17:15] THAT TO BECOME COMMON TO YOU. GOD GOD
[17:18] CALLED YOU.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; Watch this statement. He said, he said,
[17:23] "Now Abraham, we find out, he didn't
[17:26] appear until about the 12th chapter of
[17:29] Genesis, 11th chapter." He said, "We
[17:31] find out his father came from Babylon."
[17:34] And Abraham was just an ordinary man. He
[17:36] says as you and I or anyone else. And he
[17:38] was gathering, he said, getting rather
[17:41] we would think an age man. He was 75
[17:44] years old and he had a he married his
[17:45] half sister. Her name was Sarah. And he
[17:48] said his name then of course wasn't
[17:49] Abraham. He was Abram and hers was
[17:52] Sarah. So we find out it was 10 years
[17:54] younger. And he says which made her 65
[17:57] and and him 75 YEARS OLD. HE WAS
[18:00] PROBABLY a farmer and he lived in the
[18:02] valley of Shinar there and he lived an
[18:04] ordinary life and he probably WENT OUT
[18:07] IN THE DAYTIME and got his meat from the
[18:09] bush and he picked berries and and he
[18:11] lived that SORT OF LIFE. HE WAS JUST AN
[18:13] ORDINARY MAN.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; And he SAID THERE WAS NOTHING SPECIAL
[18:16] about him AND HE SAID BUT ONE DAY GOD
[18:19] CALLED HIM.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU AND
[18:23] SAID OH THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL OUT
[18:25] ABOUT YOU.
[18:28] I WAS ON THE PLANE WITH A BUNCH OF
[18:30] PROFESSIONAL ball players the other day
[18:32] and you know men ran up to him and you
[18:34] KNOW AND SHOOK THEIR HAND CALLED THEIR
[18:36] NAMES. I didn't know him.
[18:41] I SAT BESIDE OF ONE OF THEM ON THE
[18:42] PLANE. I DIDN'T KNOW HIM. HE'S
[18:44] PROFESSIONAL BALL PLAYER. HE WAS PLAY HE
[18:46] WAS TALKING ABOUT GOING TO THE ALL-STAR
[18:48] GAME AND you know and all of these
[18:49] different kind of things. HE WAS
[18:51] EXCITED. EVERYBODY AROUND ME WAS EXCITED
[18:53] BECAUSE HE WAS THERE. BUT I WAS JUST AN
[18:56] ORDINARY MAN
[19:02] &gt;&gt; AND HE THOUGHT HE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; HE WAS GIFTED TO PLAY BALL. HE WAS
[19:08] GIFTED TO DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS.
[19:10] MY SON BACK HERE WON THAT ONE TIME
[19:12] PLAYED BALL. AND YOU KNOW, HE WAS A VERY
[19:14] SPECIAL ATHLETE. HE WAS HE WAS AN ALL
[19:17] STATE ATHLETE back here. Thank God he
[19:19] was that cuz he dragged me out of the
[19:20] fire here a while back.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; But anyway, ANYWAY, ONE DAY, ALL OF THAT
[19:26] SPECIAL FOR A LONG TIME AND IT WAS A
[19:28] PHASE OF HIS LIFE. BUT ONE day
[19:34] &gt;&gt; in A MEETING LIKE THIS, GOD CAME.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, THAT'S YOUR SON."
[19:39] LISTEN, BEING MY SON DIDN'T GIVE HIM
[19:42] SAVED.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; That didn't get him saved. DIDN'T GET
[19:45] HIM THE HOLY GHOST. HE HAS TO GET IT THE
[19:48] SAME WAY I'VE GOT TO GET IT.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we want to polish it up
[19:55] and we want to simonize it a little bit
[19:57] and we want to we want to say we've got
[19:59] to go through a church ritual. We got to
[20:01] read certain books and we got to do this
[20:03] kind of thing and we want to make it
[20:04] easy on our children. But I got news for
[20:06] you. To get A NEW BIRTH, YOU'VE GOT TO
[20:08] STRUGGLE.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO DIE OUT TO TO THE LORD.
[20:14] YOU'VE GOT TO TOTALLY SURRENDER. AND I
[20:16] KNEW THAT HE HAD TO COME TO THAT PLACE
[20:18] IN HIS LIFE.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, GOD DON'T FORCE nothing on you.
[20:23] And as a parent, I DIDN'T FORCE NOTHING
[20:25] ON HIM. BUT I KNEW IF I JUST KEPT
[20:27] WATERING,
[20:30] &gt;&gt; if I just kept HIM IN THE RIGHT
[20:32] ATMOSPHERE,
[20:33] &gt;&gt; ONE DAY THEY WOULD COME TO AN ALTAR SUCH
[20:36] AS THIS AND RECEIVE GOD AND MEET THAT
[20:39] SUPERNATURAL GOD THAT I'M AT.
[20:46] It was in a service much like this when
[20:48] he received the baptism of the Holy
[20:50] Ghost.
[20:52] A few days later, he walked into my
[20:54] office.
[20:56] He sat down and he seemed to be a little
[20:58] troubled. He looked across and colleges
[21:00] were calling and they were writing, they
[21:04] were wanting, they were projecting a lot
[21:06] of things. And he looked over and he
[21:08] said, "It's over.
[21:13] IT'S ALL OVER.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; I PUT MY HELMET ON THE LAST TIME.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; I sacked my last quarterback.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Why? God came.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; God came.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; AND NOT JUST A TEACHING,
[21:31] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST A FEELING,
[21:34] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD CAME.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; I trust you believe in that.
[21:41] He says, he says, "And God," HE SAID,
[21:43] "PROBABLY a farmer." HE SAID, "BUT ONE
[21:45] DAY GOD CALLED HIM." And he said, "That
[21:48] makes the difference." Brother Ram says,
[21:51] "There's a major difference between a
[21:53] being a Christian and a Holy Ghost
[21:56] fililled Christian."
[21:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "WHEN GOD MAKES THE CALL,
[22:00] THAT'S THE WAY IT TAKES. IT TAKES GOD."
[22:02] It isn't what you do, IT'S WHAT GOD
[22:05] DOES. YOU SAY, "I SOUGHT GOD. I SOUGHT
[22:08] GOD." YOU'RE MISTAKEN. NO MAN SEEKS GOD.
[22:10] IT'S GOD THAT SEEKS MAN.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IT'S NOT BY AN ACCIDENT. YOU'RE
[22:16] HERE. WE'RE HERE.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; GOD SAW THIS CAMP.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAW THE ORCHESTRATION OF THIS MOMENT.
[22:25] Maybe you labored hard. Maybe you gave
[22:27] monies that you FEEL LIKE YOU DIDN'T
[22:29] EVEN HAVE. BUT LISTEN, THE ETERNAL THING
[22:32] IS WHEN GOD BEGINS TO DRAW HIS CHILDREN
[22:35] TOGETHER AND HE COMES ON TO LISTEN,
[22:39] THERE'S BILLION DOLLAR BUILDINGS AND
[22:41] MILLION DOLLAR BUILDINGS THAT ARE BUILT
[22:43] THAT GOD DOESN'T EVEN ATTEND.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD WANTED A TENT TO BE SET ON THIS
[22:51] PROPERTY
[22:54] &gt;&gt; THAT HE COULD GATHER HIS CHILDREN AND HE
[22:57] NOT ONLY GATHER THEM TOGETHER, BUT OUR
[23:00] GOD COULD COME DOWN IN THE COOL OF THE
[23:02] EVENING AND HE COULD MEET YOU.
[23:08] HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE A SPECIAL PEOPLE.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT IT
[23:13] JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT, JUST FOR A
[23:14] MOMENT. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND NO
[23:16] MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL WHISPERS in your
[23:18] ear, NO MATTER HE WHAT HE TELLS YOU, YOU
[23:20] NEED TO BE LIKE THE WORLD, YOU NEED TO
[23:22] COMPROMISE WITH THE WORLD. LISTEN, IT IS
[23:25] A SPECIAL PLACE THAT GOD WOULD CALL YOU
[23:27] TO THIS NIGHT.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[23:35] And he said,
[23:37] he said, "So you're chose before the
[23:40] foundation of the world or you wasn't
[23:43] even chose at all." He said, "Your
[23:45] names,"
[23:47] he says he just came to redeem that
[23:50] name. And all whose names were not in
[23:54] the lamb's book of life before the
[23:56] foundation of the world is only going to
[23:58] be there anyway. He said, "You were
[24:00] chosen him before the foundation of the
[24:04] world." When the lamb was chosen, HE
[24:07] SAID, "THEN YOU WERE CHOSEN WITH HIM
[24:10] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD." AS
[24:12] I SAID LAST NIGHT, YOU'RE AN ATTRIBUTE
[24:15] OF GOD'S THINKING.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[24:19] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT
[24:21] YOU CAN BE ETERNAL AND HAVE AN ETERNAL
[24:24] LIFE. THERE'S ONLY ONE FORM OF ETERNAL
[24:26] LIFE, AND THAT'S IN GOD.
[24:30] SO IF GOD THOUGHT OF me being here
[24:33] &gt;&gt; and this tent BEING HERE AND THESE
[24:36] PEOPLE BEING HERE,
[24:37] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, HE THOUGHT YOU BEING HERE.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me just now?
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to just notice
[24:49] David no doubt
[24:51] Abram no doubt looked at themselves as
[24:54] an ordinary man.
[24:57] No doubt when he be God be to talk to
[24:59] him, he he thought within his own mind,
[25:01] there's no way there's no way that I can
[25:04] have children. As a matter of fact, the
[25:06] scripture tells us when God speaks to
[25:09] him, he literally rolled on the ground
[25:12] and laughed in the presence of God.
[25:16] AND YOU KNOW, NO DOUBT, YOU KNOW, AS
[25:18] many of us would not want this to be
[25:21] done, no doubt when maybe the biography
[25:24] of his life is written and Moses is
[25:26] writing out his life, if he could look
[25:28] over Moses's shoulder and he could look
[25:31] over his shoulder and he's watching,
[25:33] maybe if he could watch Moses right, no
[25:36] doubt, thank you, brother. No doubt HE
[25:38] WOULD SAY, "PLEASE DON'T WRITE THAT.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; Please don't write that. And you know
[25:46] THE INSPIRATION THAT YOU KNOW A MAN IS
[25:48] LED BY THE INSPIRATION OF GOD AND HE'S
[25:50] AND HE'S WRITING OUT AND HE'S AND HE GOD
[25:53] IS WRITING AND HE'S HE'S BEGINNING TO
[25:55] WRITE AND HE'S beginning to write about
[25:57] Abram and and he said Abram begin TO
[25:59] WALK WITH GOD AND THIS GOD SAID I'M
[26:01] GOING TO HAVE A COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND
[26:03] THEY now Abram I'm not going to call you
[26:06] Abram no more BECAUSE YOU CANNOT YOU
[26:10] CANNOT PRODUCE THE PROMISE OF GOD AS THE
[26:13] MAN ABRAM.
[26:15] AND HE SAYS, "I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
[26:17] CHANGE YOUR NAME."
[26:19] &gt;&gt; AND SO HE PUTS HIMSELF, JEHOVAH PUTS
[26:22] HIMSELF INSIDE OF ABRAM'S NAME, and now
[26:25] he's called Abraham.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; AND HE REALIZES THAT SARAH BEING A
[26:30] DOMINATING FEMALE.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; HE REALIZES THAT IN HER NATURE, she
[26:36] can't produce the word of God
[26:38] &gt;&gt; because they've been together all these
[26:40] years and they've never been able to
[26:41] produce it in that way. AND YOU SAY,
[26:43] "BROTHER, HOW IN THE WORLD CAN I MAKE A
[26:44] RAPTURE? YOU CAN'T IN YOUR ORIGINAL
[26:47] BIRTH."
[26:49] &gt;&gt; And you SIT AND YOU RRESTLE AND YOU AND
[26:51] MAYBE you're in even in a spot of maybe
[26:54] just kind of on THE OUTSIDE FRINGE
[26:56] LOOKING IN AND YOU SAY, "BROTHER, I
[26:57] CAN'T LIVE LIKE THESE PEOPLE AND I CAN'T
[27:00] GO TO CHURCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE AND AND I
[27:02] CAN'T LIVE A LIFE WHAT like what people
[27:04] are talking about. I've been raised IN
[27:06] THE MESSAGE, BUT I CAN'T LIVE IT LIKE
[27:07] MOM AND DAD. I I GO TO CHURCH AND I JUST
[27:10] DON'T GET ANYTHING." WELL, THAT ONLY
[27:11] LETS YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVEN'T REALLY
[27:13] MET GOD.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, GOD IS CALLING
[27:16] YOU.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; JUST YOUR BEING HERE HAS REPRESENTED
[27:21] THAT THERE'S A CALLING TO YOU.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I'VE GOT ISSUES."
[27:27] ABRAHAM HAD ISSUES.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE WRITE BOOKS AND THEY
[27:32] HAVE STORIES ABOUT THEIR ISSUES IN THEIR
[27:34] LIFE. People want to blame their
[27:36] parents. THEY WANT TO BLAME THE SCHOOLS.
[27:38] THEY WANT TO BLAME THE GOVERNMENT. THEY
[27:40] WANT TO BLAME EVERYBODY ELSE BUT
[27:42] THEMSELVES.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; THE GREATEST ENEMY THAT YOU HAVE IS YOU.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; AND THE GREATEST OVERCOMING THAT YOU
[27:50] WILL EVER DO IN YOUR LIFE, IT'S OVERCOME
[27:52] YOURSELF.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM REALIZED AS ABRAM, HE WAS A
[27:59] LIAR.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; He run from pressure.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; HE RAN TO GREER. PRESSURE CAME DOWN CUZ
[28:09] YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE UNDER PRESSURE.
[28:11] Pressure came down. He said she's my
[28:14] sister.
[28:18] Please don't write that.
[28:21] Please don't write that.
[28:24] I'm sure when he was writing, MOSES IS
[28:26] EVEN WRITING ABOUT himself
[28:29] &gt;&gt; and GOD WAS SAYING, "TELL THEM YOU HAVE
[28:30] A TEMPER.
[28:36] PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME WRITE THAT.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I got news for you. GOD LOVED
[28:41] YOU WHILE YOU WERE YET A SINNER.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; I'M SURE DAVID HAS SOME TIMES IN HIS
[28:48] LIFE THAT HE WISHES THAT IN THE BOOK OF
[28:51] LIFE WASN'T written there.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; THERE'S AN ADULTEROUS AFFAIR.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME?
[29:00] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A MURDER OF A MAN.
[29:02] THERE'S A MAN RUNNING FROM THE PRESENCE
[29:04] OF THE LORD. HE FINDS HIMSELF IN A CAVE.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; HE'S FEIGNING HIMSELF AT THE GATES OF
[29:09] GOLIATH CITY.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; I'M SURE THAT I'M SURE THERE'S SPOTS IN
[29:13] HIS LIFE, PLEASE DON'T. PLEASE DON'T.
[29:16] YOU'RE THE SAME WAY.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'D BE HONEST TONIGHT, THERE'S BEEN
[29:20] SOME REAL SPOTS.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother, this is not for me."
[29:24] I got news for you. If you've been a
[29:25] Christian 70 years,
[29:28] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE STILL THANKFUL
[29:29] &gt;&gt; THAT HE TOOK OUR TOOK OUR OLD UNION,
[29:33] &gt;&gt; INVISIBLE UNION OF THE BRIDE. HE TOOK
[29:36] OUR OLD UNION,
[29:37] &gt;&gt; OUR FIRST NATURE, OUR OLD DESIRES.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THOSE DESIRES AND HE PUT THEM IN
[29:46] THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; YOU AT ONE TIME HAD A DESIRE FOR THE
[29:51] WORLD. HAD A DESIRE FOR THE WORLD'S
[29:54] MUSIC.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[30:04] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we want to hide that side
[30:06] of ourselves. Jesus turns around to
[30:09] Simon and he said,"Simon,
[30:12] SATAN HATH DESIRED TO SIFT YOU.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; You're in Leosa tonight and I have news
[30:19] for you. You are going to produce
[30:21] something
[30:23] &gt;&gt; and you are at war.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; You're at war. YOU HAVE AN ENEMY AGAINST
[30:29] YOU. YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH HIM.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T PLAY HIS HALFWAY GAME.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT EVEN A good negotiator.
[30:40] Oh, brother Ron, I just I WANT TO HE
[30:42] WILL BEGIN TO TELL YOU, YOU CAN GO TO
[30:44] CHURCH without a birth.
[30:47] You don't have to have the HOLY SPIRIT.
[30:50] YOU CAN JUST HAVE AN EDUCATION. THAT
[30:52] KIND OF THING wants to creep right in
[30:54] the message.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE LONG, WE GET AN intellectual
[30:59] experience
[31:00] &gt;&gt; AND WE SIT RIGHT THERE. OH, WE GET THE
[31:03] DRESS RIGHT AND WE GET THE WE GET THE
[31:05] TIE RIGHT. WE GET OUR HAIR RIGHT AND WE
[31:07] GET EXACTLY RIGHT WITH OUR SHOES. BUT IF
[31:10] WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE DIDN'T GET THE
[31:12] LIFE.
[31:14] AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE LIFE.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; ABRAM COULD NOT PRODUCE THE PROMISE
[31:24] WITHOUT THE LIFE.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to be like this one and I
[31:32] want to be like this one and I want to
[31:34] BE LIKE THIS ONE. AND I LOOK AT A STRONG
[31:36] ONE IN THE CHURCH AND I WANT TO BE LIKE
[31:38] THEM. I GOT NEWS for you. Without
[31:39] Christ,
[31:42] &gt;&gt; they were a stinker.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT CHRIST, I WAS A STINKER.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO THERE. BUT
[31:51] GOD TOOK MY BOOK.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THAT BOOK.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THAT DRUG ADDICT BOOK.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK THAT ADDICTION BOOK. AND HE
[32:04] WASHED IT WITH THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[32:06] CHRIST.
[32:08] AND IT'S NOT EVEN THERE ANYMORE.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; GOD SO JUSTIFIES YOU UNTIL IT'S AS
[32:14] THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST
[32:17] PLACE.
[32:19] MANY PEOPLE SIT AND LISTEN THAT THE
[32:21] DEVIL BEAT THEM IN THEIR MEMORY CHANNEL
[32:23] AND THEIR IMAGINATION CHANNEL AND THEIR
[32:26] AFFECTION CHANNEL
[32:28] &gt;&gt; AND HE WARS WITH THEM AND HE REMINDS
[32:31] THEM OF YESTERDAYS OR WHAT COULD BE OR
[32:34] THE WHATIFS OF LIFE OR THE PEER PRESSURE
[32:37] OF LIFE AND TELLS YOU YOUR FRIENDS ARE
[32:39] DOING THIS AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE DOING
[32:41] THAT AND THEY'RE GOING IN THIS DIRECTION
[32:43] BUT WE'RE NOT CALLED TO THIS WORLD.
[32:46] THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME. I'M JUST A
[32:49] PASSING THROUGH.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; They seem like they're having JUST SUCH
[32:56] A GOOD TIME. THIS IS THE only heaven
[32:58] they'll ever have.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? THIS IS THE ONLY HEAVEN
[33:04] THEY'LL EVER HAVE.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER, I WANT TO JUST GO TELL THEM
[33:07] THEY'RE GOING TO HELL. THIS IS THE ONLY
[33:09] HEAVEN THEY'LL EVER HAVE.
[33:11] YOU WERE CALLED BECAUSE THE SEED IN YOU
[33:14] THAT WAS PUT THERE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[33:16] OF THE WORLD. THERE WAS A DEEP THAT
[33:18] COULD RESPOND TO THE DEEP.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD DIDN'T SATISFY YOU.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; They look at you strange.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; They looked at you strange when you look
[33:33] them in the eyes said, "I don't do that.
[33:37] Why do you dress that certain way?" I'll
[33:39] tell you why you dress that certain way.
[33:41] And it's not because of church. It's
[33:44] because of God's word.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Why do you not cut your hair? It's
[33:50] because that's what God's word tells me.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; And they begin to look at you in a
[33:56] certain way. AND YOU SAY, "I DON'T DO
[33:57] THIS FOR A PEOPLE. I DO THIS FOR GOD."
[34:03] &gt;&gt; And they want you TO TURN TO A CERTAIN
[34:04] RADIO AND YOU SAY, "NO, I DON'T LISTEN
[34:06] TO THAT KIND OF TRASH.
[34:08] I DON'T WATCH THOSE THOSE KIND OF
[34:10] MOVIES.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; I DON'T GO TO THOSE INTERNET SITES.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE
[34:17] OF ME.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love the Lord?
[34:25] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother Ron, but I CAN'T
[34:27] DO THAT. I I just can't seem to live the
[34:30] life." LISTEN, WITHOUT GOD, NONE OF US
[34:32] CAN. Brother Bram SAYS WE ARE INVITED TO
[34:36] SHAPE OUR CHARACTER TO HIS CHARACTER.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS HE SAID SHAPING OUR
[34:41] CHARACTER HIS TO HIS OWN CHARACTER. THEN
[34:44] WE BY HIM ARE THE SONS OF GOD.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE OH BROTHER I I I I WANT TO
[34:50] BE I WANT TO BE. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS NOW
[34:53] ARE WE THE SONS OF GOD.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Oh one day one day ONE DAY ONE DAY.
[34:59] LISTEN NOW ARE WE THE SONS OF GOD.
[35:06] God in his fore planning
[35:08] in his fore planning when he was
[35:11] preparing Lelay Oysa
[35:13] and he was watching who would live in
[35:15] this age. Abram was called to live in
[35:18] his day. Jonah was called to live in his
[35:21] day. Nehemiah was called to live in his
[35:24] day. Are you following me?
[35:28] &gt;&gt; They overcome their age.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? THE APOSTLE PAUL AND
[35:33] ALL THE followers overcame their age.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther and the followers overcame
[35:38] their age.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; And here came brother Brandham in the
[35:42] message of the hour.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Sure, he had weaknesses, but I'm not
[35:46] here to destroy him with HIS WEAKNESSES
[35:48] CUZ I GOT WEAKNESSES.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SAME DEITY THAT LIVED INSIDE OF
[35:53] HIM.
[35:55] THE VOICE THAT WAS BEARDING THE VOICE OF
[35:57] WHO IS THIS MELZDC also lives in us.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD THAT HELPED HIM TO OVERCOME
[36:09] AND SPOKE TO HIM IN A TREE.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD COMES TO MEETINGS LIKE
[36:16] THIS
[36:19] &gt;&gt; AND THROUGH THE VOICE OF A SPEAKER TO
[36:22] YOU.
[36:24] AND TELLS YOU YOU'RE A SPECIAL PEOPLE.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE AN ORDAINED PEOPLE.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A CAUSE PEOPLE.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A PREDESTINATED PEOPLE.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO OVERCOME.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE SOME REAL BATTLES. YOU'VE GOT
[36:44] FREE CHOICE BECAUSE GOD DON'T FORCE
[36:46] NOTHING ON YOU.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; You come TO CHURCH. MAYBE YOUR MOTHER
[36:51] AND YOUR FATHER HAS HAS THROUGH THE
[36:53] INSISTENCE OF THE WORD HAS SAID, "NO, I
[36:55] WANT YOU TO GO. I want you to go. I WANT
[36:57] YOU TO GO." BUT ONE DAY, YOU'VE GOT A
[36:58] CHOICE TO MAKE.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; AND GOD DON'T FORCE NOTHING ON YOU.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; HE DON'T SEND YOU THROUGH A PIPE AND
[37:06] JUST ALLOW YOU TO COME OUT THE OTHER
[37:08] SIDE. HE DON'T PRESS A BUTTON AND YOU'RE
[37:10] AUTOMATICALLY OVERCOMING. YOU'VE GOT
[37:12] SOME WRESTLING TO DO.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT SOME FIGHTING TO DO.
[37:16] YOU WALK TO AN ALTAR, YOU COME TO A
[37:18] SERVICE, YOU FEEL THE SPIRIT OF GOD.
[37:20] HEY, LISTEN. THAT ISN'T FINISHED PRODUCT
[37:22] YET.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT SOME REAL BATTLES THAT YOU'VE
[37:26] GOT TO OVERCOME.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE 20 OR YOU'RE 90,
[37:29] YOU'RE STILL OVERCOMING.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LISTEN,
[37:36] WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT THESE scriptures
[37:40] are more ALIVE TONIGHT THAN THEY'VE ever
[37:42] been,
[37:45] &gt;&gt; THAT THE GOD THAT CHANGED ABRAHAM
[37:49] &gt;&gt; AND PRODUCED A SON CALLED ISAAC IN HIM
[37:52] &gt;&gt; IS GOING TO PRODUCE A SUPER RACE AND A
[37:55] SUPER CHURCH.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING TO PRODUCE
[38:00] &gt;&gt; A PROJECTION OF HIS MIND.
[38:04] HALLELUJAH.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; SURE. IN OUR BOOK OF LIFE, IN OUR
[38:08] PARABLE OF LIES, WE HAVE WEAKNESSES WITH
[38:10] THE WORLD. WE HAVE WEAKNESSES WITH
[38:12] OURSELVES.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; We be real honest. There's some times
[38:17] that, listen, YOU FEEL LIKE GOD OUGHT TO
[38:19] TAKE YOU UP AND PUT YOU OVER A DUMPSTER
[38:21] SOMEWHERE ANOTHER AND PUT YOU IN.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOME TIMES THAT GOD, YOU FEEL
[38:25] LIKE GOD'S RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU. THERE'S
[38:27] TIMES YOU FEEL LIKE HE'S A MILLION MILES
[38:29] AWAY.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; THERE'S TIMES THAT YOU HOPE GOD IS RIGHT
[38:32] THERE WITH YOU. AND THERE'S TIMES THAT
[38:33] YOU HOPE GOD IS A MILLION MILES AWAY
[38:38] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'RE FIGHTING WITH YOUR
[38:39] WEAKNESSES.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIMES WE FEEL LIKE, "OH, BROTHER
[38:42] RON, NOBODY KNOWS." I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
[38:45] GOD KNOWS.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; SANTA CLAUS, HE DON'T KNOW.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP. HE KNOWS
[38:56] WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE. HE KNOWS WHEN YOU'VE
[38:58] BEEN BAD OR GOOD. SO be good FOR
[38:59] GOODNESS SAKE.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; WHAT AN IMITATION. MY GOD,
[39:06] &gt;&gt; MY GOD IS ALIVE TONIGHT. AND HE KNOWS.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOUR WEAKNESSES HAS
[39:12] CAUSED ME TO HAVE TO PREACH THE SERMON
[39:14] TONIGHT BECAUSE HE KNOWS.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THAT. HE WANTS TO COME TO YOU.
[39:19] HE WANTS TO HELP YOU.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, I WRESTLE WITH MYSELF. SO
[39:26] DID JACOB. RIGHT.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; JACOB WAS A REAL RASCAL.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; HERE WAS A MAN THAT'S GOING TO BE CALLED
[39:34] ISRAEL, A PRINCE WITH GOD.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; BUT LISTEN, HE'S A DECEIVER.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; NOBODY IN THIS CHURCH would have picked
[39:40] him.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAID,
[39:45] &gt;&gt; "I LOVE JACOB AND I HATE ESAU."
[39:49] &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, HIS OWN FATHER,
[39:53] GOD HAD TO BLIND HIS EYES.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; HE WAS STAGGERING IN THE DARKNESS.
[39:59] HE WAS STAGGERING IN THE DARKNESS, MAYBE
[40:01] FEELING HIS WAY TO the tent, FEELING HIS
[40:04] WAY TO THE TABLE,
[40:07] feeling his wife, his beautiful wife,
[40:11] A LOVE STORY. AND HE WAS FEELING HIS WAY
[40:15] BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T HAVE PICKED JACOB.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD HAVE NEVER PICKED JACOB.
[40:28] SO GOD SENT A BLINDNESS ON HIM.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; GOD DID HIM A FAVOR.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, BROTHER, WHY DID I HAVE TO
[40:39] GO THROUGH THAT TRIAL? WHY DID THEY HAVE
[40:40] TO GO THROUGH THAT TRIAL?" HE DID YOU a
[40:44] favor.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; I WILL TELL YOU THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE
[40:49] OF LAST SEPTEMBER 10TH, HE DID ME A
[40:52] FAVOR.
[41:01] While I couldn't even write, WHILE I
[41:03] COULDN'T EVEN USE A COMPUTER, WHILE I
[41:05] COULDN'T EVEN USE A PHONE, I COULD HEAR
[41:07] THE VOICE OF THAT PROPHET.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; AND FOR MONTHS, LISTEN, A MONTH, SITTING
[41:14] IN A WHEELCHAIR, MONTHS SITTING THERE
[41:16] WITH MY WIFE WAITING ON ME HAND AND FOOT
[41:19] LIKE AN IMBLELET CHILD. WHILE I SAT
[41:21] THERE, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. I SAT AND I
[41:25] ALLOWED GOD TO ABSORB INTO MY LIFE LIKE
[41:28] NEVER BEFORE. I SAY HERE TONIGHT, HE DID
[41:32] ME A FAVOR.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "OH, WHAT A HORRIBLE THING THE
[41:42] DEVIL DID. HE DID ME A FAVOR."
[41:47] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, GOD'S BIGGER THAN THE DEVIL.
[41:50] WE GIVE THE DEVIL TOO MUCH CREDIT.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; GOD IS BIGGER THAN ANY DEVIL IN HELL.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "I CAN'T OVERCOME MY WEAKNESS."
[41:59] I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. THERE'S NOT A
[42:01] WEAKNESS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
[42:04] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD CAN HELP YOU WITH.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "BROTHER RON, I DON'T HAVE A
[42:09] THIRST FOR GOD. I DON'T HAVE A HUNGER
[42:11] LIKE I NEED TO." PRAY GOD, TAKE THE
[42:14] DESIRES OUT OF MY LIFE THAT ARE
[42:16] SUBSTITUTING THEMSELVES FOR GOD. GOD
[42:18] CREATED ME A REVIVAL.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT SCRIPTURE DAVID SAID. CREATE
[42:25] IN ME A CLEAN HEART. OH GOD,
[42:29] &gt;&gt; RENEW.
[42:31] Renew a right spirit.
[42:48] Brother said each generation has to have
[42:50] its own revival.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; The reason we have seminaries,
[43:04] polish schools,
[43:06] is because they have rearview mirrors.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; They want to take you back to the 1500s.
[43:15] the day of Pentecost.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; They want to take you back to Luther.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; They want to take you back to Westley.
[43:22] They want to take you back to Isuza
[43:24] Street.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Not done.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Want to take you back to 1965.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; I wasn't sitting in the meetings then.
[43:45] He was.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; But when it came my turn to set in his
[43:53] meetings,
[43:56] he took me there.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; DAD SAID, "YOU'LL ENJOY HIM."
[44:06] And he began to SPEAK
[44:09] AND LET US RUN.
[44:13] 12-500 PEOPLE SITTING there
[44:17] and I sat there AND HE BEGAN TO TELL
[44:20] ABOUT PAUL RAN,
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Gford ran,
[44:27] Peter Cartright ran,
[44:32] &gt;&gt; William Brham ran,
[44:35] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID THE BATON HAS BEEN HANDED
[44:37] OFF.
[44:41] AND AS I SAT THERE AS A YOUNG MAN
[44:43] &gt;&gt; JUST MARRIED TO MY BEAUTIFUL LITTLE WIFE
[44:45] HERE, SOMETHING STRUCK IN MY HEART.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; THAT SEED THAT HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE THE
[44:53] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; That seed THAT THROUGH NATURE HAD BEEN
[44:58] TAKEN CARE OF. MAYBE MY FOREFATHERS CAME
[45:00] ACROSS ON SHIPS AND STORMS WENT AGAINST
[45:03] THEM, BUT THEY WERE CARRYING MY SEED.
[45:06] MAYBE THEIR FOREFATHERS WERE IN WARS AND
[45:09] GOD PROTECTED THAT SIN.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; HE STOPPED BULLETS.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; HE STOPPED BRIGADES.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; HE WATCHED OVER MANY TIMES IN DEATH
[45:21] CAMPS,
[45:22] &gt;&gt; THE BUBANIC PLAGUES,
[45:24] &gt;&gt; THE FLU,
[45:26] &gt;&gt; BABIES DYING. HE WATCHED OVER MY NATURAL
[45:30] SEED.
[45:34] OH, HALLELUJAH.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. PEOPLE SAY, "OH, GOD'S
[45:38] NEVER DID NOTHING FOR ME JUST TO GET YOU
[45:41] HERE." IT'S AN INCREDIBLE MIRACLE.
[45:52] Whether you have red hair, BROWN HAIR,
[45:54] BLONDE HAIR, GOD KNEW THAT BEFORE THE
[45:56] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. WHETHER YOU'RE
[45:57] TALL OR YOU'RE SHORT, YOU'RE SKINN OR
[45:59] YOU'RE FAT. GOD KNEW THAT BEFORE THE
[46:01] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; HE WATCHED OVER YOUR NATURAL HOUSING
[46:05] BECAUSE INSIDE OF THAT NATURAL HOUSING,
[46:08] HE WAS GOING TO PUT A SEED ABOUT THE
[46:10] SIZE OF A LITTLE BUTTON.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; AND HE WILL BANKRUPT HEAVEN.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; GOD IS DETERMINED. HE WILL BANKRUPT
[46:22] HEAVEN BECAUSE BEFORE HE LOSES ONE OF
[46:25] YOU,
[46:29] YOU SAY, "I'LL RUN." GO AHEAD AND RUN.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; RUN.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; RUN TO ALASKA.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; RUN TO NEW ZEALAND.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; RUN TO VIRGINIA. GOD'S THERE.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; I was preaching one time at a camp and
[46:48] they had a bull horn on the outside of
[46:49] the camp and WAS A MAN SITTING IN THEIR
[46:51] TRUCK. HE HAD BROUGHT HIS WIFE TO
[46:53] CHURCH. HE HAD RAN 3,000 MILES AND HE'D
[46:56] MARRIED A WOMAN from that LOCAL
[46:58] COMMUNITY WAS SITTING IN CHURCH. HE
[46:59] HATED CHURCH AND HE WAS LISTENING TO
[47:01] THAT bullhorn
[47:06] and all of a sudden he came through the
[47:07] back door
[47:09] and all of a sudden he was sitting on
[47:11] the front row
[47:13] and all of a sudden he was at the altar
[47:14] before the service was over.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I'D BEEN RUNNING."
[47:19] HE SAID, "BUT GOD FOUND ME.
[47:25] YOU SAY, "BROTHER RON, I'M ON THE RUN."
[47:27] GO AHEAD, RUN.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; RUN.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD RUN A 4-MINUTE MILE AND YOU
[47:32] CAN'T OUTRUN GOD.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to GET A JOB AWAY FROM CHURCH.
[47:37] GO AHEAD. GOD WILL FIND YOU.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT MY
[47:43] CHILDREN. GIVE THEM TO GOD.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; SAY, "GOD, I CAN'T CONVICT THEM, BUT YOU
[47:49] CAN.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE MY HUSBAND. I WANT YOU TO GO GET
[47:52] MY CHILDREN. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE HOLY
[47:55] GHOST AND SEND GOD'S HOLY GHOST AGENT. I
[47:58] HEARD BROTHER RAM SAY JUST THE OTHER
[47:59] DAY, HE SAID, "MAY GOD SEND HIS HOLY
[48:02] GHOST AGENT AND SEND CONVICTION ON
[48:05] THEM."
[48:10] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. BROTHER, I GIVE UP.
[48:13] GOOD. CUZ WHEN YOU GIVE UP, GOD BEGINS
[48:15] TO DO SOMETHING.
[48:21] It isn't supposed to be this easy on the
[48:22] first night.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Run.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; AND I WAS RUNNING
[48:35] AND HE WAS PREACHING ABOUT RUNNING
[48:39] AND SOMETHING STRUCK THAT STREET THAT
[48:43] WHICH GOD HAD DEPOSITED BEFORE THE
[48:45] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND I IN MY
[48:48] HUMANITY COULD NOT PRODUCE WHAT GOD
[48:50] WANTED.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; I DID NOT WANT TO BE A PREACHER.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; I hated being a preacher. I still hate
[48:57] being a preacher.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Makes me too nervous.
[49:08] But you see, gifts and callings are
[49:10] without repentance.
[49:15] So he begins to pull on you and he pulls
[49:19] and he moves and no man can come except
[49:22] the spirit of God draws him.
[49:26] Now he knows you've got some overcoming
[49:27] that you've got to do.
[49:30] But so did the woman at the well.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; And she had some weaknesses. She had
[49:38] some excuses. And you've got some
[49:41] excuses. You're said, you're sitting
[49:43] here tonight and you said, "My friends."
[49:48] Well, what are your friends?
[49:50] &gt;&gt; A friend that'll put a beer bottle to
[49:52] your to your mouth is not your friend.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; A FRIEND THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE WRONG
[49:57] KIND OF A MOVIE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; A FRIEND THAT PLAYS THE WRONG KIND OF
[50:05] MUSIC, HE'S NOT YOUR FRIEND.
[50:09] A FRIEND THAT WILL HAVE SOMETHING
[50:10] DIFFERENT THAN CHURCH IS NOT YOUR
[50:12] FRIEND.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; It's okay. Just the first night.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I know everything brother
[50:27] Ram said, so does the devil.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; He attended every one of Brother Ram's
[50:34] meetings.
[50:36] That don't give him a new birth.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I ain't been here 17 years.
[50:40] I've been in church ALL THESE YEARS. YOU
[50:41] STILL NEED A BIRTH.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; If Mary had to go to Pentecost,
[50:46] &gt;&gt; you've got to go to Pentecost.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'd walked to an ALTAR AND
[50:52] I WALKED AWAY AND THE NEXT WEEK, YOU
[50:53] KNOW, I WAS STRONGER. AND THEN WEEKS
[50:55] LATER, YOU KNOW, I I FOUND OUT THAT I
[50:57] just didn't have it. And so I kind of I
[50:59] kind of just kind of went back. And
[51:01] brother Ron, I want to BE IN A CERTAIN
[51:03] CLICK IN THE CHURCH.
[51:06] I want to be in the click.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; The click that is filled with the Holy
[51:12] Ghost.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; The click that has a Holy Ghost meeting
[51:18] &gt;&gt; and I MEET GOD.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE IN the click
[51:22] &gt;&gt; TO WHERE WHEN I GET SICK, I CAN SAY,
[51:24] "YOU PRAY for me." And you just
[51:26] immediately go to prayer.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of click I want to be
[51:33] in.
[51:35] I want to be in the kind of group that
[51:36] IS NOT SATISFIED WITH JUST SITTING IN A
[51:38] PEW.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; I want to be in THE GROUP THAT IS NOT
[51:44] SATISFIED WITH JUST CLAPPING THEIR
[51:46] HANDS,
[51:48] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A BURST FROM THEIR HEART.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; I'm one OF THEM. I'M ONE OF THEM. I'M SO
[51:56] GLAD THAT I CAN SAY I'M ONE OF THEM.
[52:05] TELL ME, BROTHER RON, WHAT MAKES THE
[52:07] DIFFERENCE? I'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU MEET
[52:09] GOD.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD THAT WILLIAM BRANDON MET AT
[52:13] THE OLD WOODSHED.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD THAT MET HIM AT A CAVE.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD THAT STOOD AND PREACHED THE
[52:21] SEVEN SAILS.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD IS STILL ALIVE TONIGHT.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST IN A BOOK. IT'S NOT JUST
[52:30] IN A PICTURE ON THE WALL,
[52:39] &gt;&gt; I tell you what. The same transforming
[52:41] power that turned Simon to Peter.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; The same transforming power that turned
[52:47] Abram to Abraham.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; The same transforming power that turned
[52:51] Sarah from a dominating female to a
[52:53] princess with God.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; The same transforming power can take a
[52:57] lessian Jezebel,
[53:02] &gt;&gt; THE BARBIE DOLL OF THE CHURCH, AND MAKE
[53:05] A SAINT OF GOD out of her.
[53:10] THAT SAME GOD CAN TAKE A BOY ON THE
[53:13] FRINGE.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; HE MAY BE THE DEACON'S KIDS, THE
[53:19] PREACHERS'S KIDS,
[53:21] &gt;&gt; BUT ONE DAY HE MEETS THE FIRE FOR
[53:23] HIMSELF.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. They told me not to preach
[53:37] for a year.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; One time. I said just one time. And
[53:47] every time I get in the pull pit, I
[53:49] preach one time.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; I want to read about you. Satan hasn't
[54:01] got any legal rights at all over a
[54:05] Christian.
[54:10] The woman at the well once she left the
[54:11] presence of God no longer had a weakness
[54:13] for men.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; And if you apply it the right way, once
[54:21] you leave this altar, YOU MAY HAVE HAD
[54:23] SOME weaknesses in the old book.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; You say about it, Brother Ron, nobody
[54:29] knows. God knows.
[54:33] GOD KNOWS THOSE SITES THAT YOU GO TO,
[54:36] &gt;&gt; THOSE MY SPACES,
[54:41] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? THOSE PLACES THAT YOU
[54:43] GO WHEN NOBODY ELSE KNOWS.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; WE LIVE IN SUCH AN INFORMATION AGE THAT
[54:49] EVERYTHING IS AT YOUR DISPOSAL. ONLY A
[54:51] click
[54:53] &gt;&gt; and YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE PIT OF HELL.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; AND SATAN WARS WITH YOUR MIND BECAUSE
[54:57] THAT'S THE SPACES THAT HE CAN GO TO.
[55:00] LISTEN, HE CAN'T GO TO YOUR SOUL, BUT HE
[55:02] CAN COME TO YOUR MIND AND HE WARS WITH
[55:04] YOU AND HE WARS WITH YOU. BUT IF YOU'LL
[55:06] TAKE THAT SUPERNATURAL TONGUE AND SAY,
[55:08] "DEVIL, YOU HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHTS, NO
[55:11] AUTHORITY OVER ME.
[55:14] I CHASTISE THOSE THOUGHTS IN THE NAME OF
[55:17] JESUS CHRIST AND YOU HAVE DEFEATED ME."
[55:22] HOW MANY TIMES DID BROTHER BRANDHAM LOOK
[55:24] AT THE devil and say, "Satan, I want to
[55:26] take you back to a place in a cave where
[55:29] an angel of the Lord met ME AND YOU'RE
[55:32] STRIPPED OF ALL YOUR POWER.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; And I was TOLD BY AN ANGEL OF THE LORD
[55:36] THAT NOT EVEN CANCER could stand before
[55:38] me."
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, the devil KNEW THAT, BUT HE WAS
[55:42] REMINDING HIM OF THAT.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "BROTHER, I HAVE COMPLETELY I
[55:46] HAVE WEAKNESS AFTER WEAKNESS." JUST KEEP
[55:48] REMINDING THE DEVIL.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; It might HAVE TO GO ON A YEAR THAT YOU
[55:55] WRESTLE WITH HIM, BUT ONE DAY YOU'LL GET
[55:57] VICTORY.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE IT DON'T GO AWAY IN A
[56:04] MONTH, IT DON'T GO AWAY IN A YEAR. DON'T
[56:07] QUIT
[56:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOUR ENERGIES DOING IT
[56:13] ANYWAY. IT'S A SUPERNATURAL GOD THAT YOU
[56:16] KEEP FEEDING YOUR SOUL WITH. YOU KEEP
[56:18] TAKING THAT WORD AND YOU KEEP TAKING
[56:20] THAT SWORD AND YOU KEEP CHOPPING THAT
[56:22] DEVIL.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; I can do all things THROUGH CHRIST WHICH
[56:28] STRENGTHENS ME.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; I've been TO THE ALTAR ONE TIME ONCE.
[56:37] KEEP GOING TILL YOU DIE.
[56:41] KEEP WRESTLING UNTIL HE COMES
[56:44] &gt;&gt; AND HOLD ON TILL HE CHANGES YOU.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Parent says, "Oh, brother, my children
[56:53] don't need that." I knew I'll tell you
[56:55] tonight without the baptism of the Holy
[56:57] Ghost,
[57:00] Satan has every right to ATTACK THEM.
[57:07] AND WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, THE FIRST
[57:08] TIME THEY HEAR ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC,
[57:10] IT'LL TAKE them that way.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, MY CHILDREN'S BEEN RAISED
[57:14] IN THE MESSAGE. SO WAS I.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; BUT WITHOUT A NEW BIRTH,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY BELIEVE, BROTHER BRANDON, SO
[57:23] DID I.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; I'LL NEVER FORGET, I HAD A FIGHT IN A
[57:25] BALLROOM ONE NIGHT. SOMEBODY SAID, "YOUR
[57:28] DADDY DON'T PREACH TRUTH." AND I BLACKED
[57:30] HIS OWN.
[57:36] Short men can't fight.
[57:42] But that didn't prove I had a birth.
[57:46] MOSES HAD A NEED.
[57:50] AND THAT PILLAR OF FIRE HAD WHAT HE
[57:52] LACKED.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, you can't get IT WITH NATURE
[57:58] VALLEY HERBS.
[58:04] You can't get it with psychology.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; JOEL OLSTEIN WITH ALL OF HIS PSYCHOLOGY
[58:10] DOES NOT PRODUCE A NEW BIRTH.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; DR. DOBSON DOES NOT PRODUCE A NEW BIRTH.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; BENNY CHICKEN DOES NOT PRODUCE A A NEW
[58:19] BIRTH.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; TD J DOES NOT PRODUCE A NEW BIRTH.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; BUT I'LL TELL YOU, CHRIST
[58:32] THE ANOINTED WORD,
[58:35] &gt;&gt; THE ANOINTED WORD FOR THIS DAY,
[58:40] &gt;&gt; THE SAME ONE THAT CAME AND GAVE MY DAD A
[58:42] NEW BIRTH.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD CAME AND GAVE ME A NEW
[58:46] BIRTH.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD CAME AND GAVE MY SONS A
[58:49] NEW BIRTH.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; SATAN WANTS US TO POLISH.
[58:58] And before long, ALL THE BUSINESSMEN ARE
[59:00] HAPPY IN THE CHURCH.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; BEFORE LONG, WE'VE GOT POLISHED SONG
[59:04] LEADERS.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT POLISHED PREACHERS.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT ENTERTAINMENT RATHER THAN A
[59:11] HOLY GHOST.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; He knows.
[59:26] He knows.
[59:30] Brother Brandham was standing there and
[59:33] he said, "I see you just about hit in a
[59:35] dark colored car by a by a train and
[59:40] you're with a man other than your
[59:42] husband."
[59:44] Don't tell it.
[59:46] He knew.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:50] He knew
[59:52] you've had incidents
[59:54] and you cover it up.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Oh, I GOT IT COVERED." GOD
[1:00:04] KNOWS.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU STATED IT THROUGH, BUT GOD
[1:00:10] KNOWS.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU TOLD A FEW LIES BECAUSE IF YOU
[1:00:14] TELL A LIE, YOU GOT TO TELL 42 TO GET
[1:00:16] KEEP COVERING IT.
[1:00:19] AND YOUR FIRST NATURE BECAUSE YOU GIVE
[1:00:22] INTO IT BEFORE LONG THEY'RE TELLING ONE
[1:00:24] AFTER ANOTHER TO KEEP IT COVERED.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, actors are not just in
[1:00:30] Hollywood. Sometimes they're sitting
[1:00:31] right here.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; We got Oscar winning performances.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE YOU DIG A DICK HERE AT THIS
[1:00:41] CHURCH DON'T MAKE YOU BORN AGAIN.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE YOU PUT A POLE UP DON'T
[1:00:45] MAKE YOU BORN AGAIN.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN RUN A SOUND SYSTEM
[1:00:49] THAT DON'T MAKE YOU BORN AGAIN.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, BUT I WORK SO HARD THAT
[1:00:58] DON'T PRODUCE A NEW BIRTH.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'LL GET YOU REWARD,
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; BROTHER. BUT I I'VE BEEN SO LONG AWAY
[1:01:04] FROM COMING FROM THE CAMP AND I, YOU
[1:01:06] KNOW, I I I REALLY I DO A LOT OF THINGS.
[1:01:08] I GO TO EVERY SERVICE. BUT DO YOU REALLY
[1:01:11] HAVE IT?
[1:01:15] The reason we have CHILDREN DELINQUENCY,
[1:01:17] WE HAVE PARENT DELINQUENCY.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; THE REASON CHILDREN DON'T PRAY IS
[1:01:22] PARENTS DON'T PRAY.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; THE REASON CHILDREN WATCH TELEVISION,
[1:01:26] MOMS AND DADS WATCH TELEVISION. The
[1:01:29] reason ch
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; am I the right place?
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE SO EXHAUSTED.
[1:01:39] THAT'S THE DEVIL'S JOB.
[1:01:42] HE KEEPS YOU SO BUSY, HE KEEPS YOU AWAY
[1:01:44] FROM YOUR FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; You're numbed and he begins to paralyze
[1:01:51] you. He paralyzes the church.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Just okay.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; You see, it's like a creeping paralysis.
[1:02:05] Brother Brandham says it creeps into the
[1:02:08] church
[1:02:10] and Before long, there's things that
[1:02:12] come in there that used to didn't come
[1:02:14] in there.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; I'm on the pews now.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Brother DDA,
[1:02:28] Brother John, Brother Tom, the Ed
[1:02:30] ministries, we watch
[1:02:34] and we watch things begin to creep in.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; AND YOU PREACH
[1:02:41] YOU THRUST YOUR VOICE BY THE ANOINTING
[1:02:43] OF GOD AND YOU WATCH SATAN
[1:02:46] BEGIN to creep in.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; OUR GREATEST DANGER IS NOT A SON OF BIN
[1:02:52] LADEN.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; A WOOLLY MAN THAT LIVES IN A CAVE.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Sounds like a little Disney tale,
[1:03:03] doesn't it?
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; OUR GREATEST DANGER IS NOT RUNNING OUT
[1:03:06] OF FUEL.
[1:03:10] IT'S NOT THE EARTH WARMING.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EVEN IRAQ OR IRAN.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; OUR GREATEST DANGER IS WORLDLYISM.
[1:03:26] BECAUSE THAT FIRST BOOK
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; IS ATTACHED TO THIS THIS EARTHLY WORLD
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; AND IT BEGINS TO CREEP INTO US
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; AND IT ATTACKS US AND BEFORE LONG OUR
[1:03:37] PRAYER LIFE IS ERODED.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; BEFORE LONG WE FEEL SO EXHAUSTED WE'VE
[1:03:42] GOT TO ENTERTAIN OURSELVES.
[1:03:51] For long we don't go to church we scream
[1:03:59] and for that
[1:04:02] let me just say this to you never
[1:04:05] forsake the assembling of yourselves
[1:04:08] together
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; so much the more as you see that day
[1:04:12] approaching
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; and it is here.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; There may not be another camp next year.
[1:04:24] Every signpost is here.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; We put it off a million miles. I got
[1:04:31] NEWS FOR YOU. IT'S NOT A MILLION MILES
[1:04:32] OFF. IT'S HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO HOME?
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; IF OUR SPIRITUAL ACTS COULD ONLY COME
[1:04:38] OPEN TO US,
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; God ordained you to live in 2008.
[1:04:50] and he sees the weaknesses
[1:04:53] that you deal with on an everyday basis.
[1:04:58] Now, we could glamorize this thing and
[1:05:02] TALK ABOUT TALK ABOUT Samson how he
[1:05:05] overcame and Shamgar and how he overcame
[1:05:09] AND PAUL HOW HE OVERCAME. But I want to
[1:05:12] see you overcome.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT PERSONAL STRUGGLES. AND LET'S
[1:05:19] NOT BE HOLLYWOOD ABOUT THIS. THEY'RE
[1:05:21] REAL.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; You go home with them.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; YOU SIT WITH THEM AND ON THE PEW BESIDE
[1:05:30] OF YOU.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; WHILE THEY'RE DOING THIS, THERE'S
[1:05:33] SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART LONGING FOR GOD.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; AND THE PEER PRESSURES THAT ARE AROUND
[1:05:38] YOU,
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; YOU WRESTLE WITH IT EVERY DAY.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; YOUNG MAN, YOU SITTING RIGHT THERE. YOU
[1:05:44] DON'T FIGHT THE BATTLES HE DOES. HE
[1:05:46] DON'T FIGHT THE BATTLES YOU DO. BUT
[1:05:48] THOSE BATTLES ARE REAL TO YOU.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; AND THERE IS AN OVERCOMING POWER.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T READ ABOUT SHADRACH, MESHACH,
[1:06:01] AND ABEDNEO BECAUSE THEY QUIT,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; THEY BENT, THEY BOWED, THEY GAVE UP,
[1:06:08] THEY COMPROMISED.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; They overcame.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; THEY OVERCAME. SURE, YOU'VE GOT
[1:06:18] WEAKNESSES.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; SURE, YOU FALL. BUT IT'S NOT HIM THAT
[1:06:22] FALLS AND LAYS THERE THAT OVERCOMES.
[1:06:24] IT'S HIM THAT
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; GETS UP.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S HIM THAT GETS UP.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; ANYBODY CAN FALL AND STAY THERE, BUT HIM
[1:06:36] THAT GETS UP.
[1:06:42] I came out of the coma after after
[1:06:45] weeks.
[1:06:48] I didn't KNOW WHERE I WAS, WHAT WAS
[1:06:50] GOING ON.
[1:06:52] BUT AFTER I begin to get SOME SENSES TO
[1:06:54] MYSELF, AND I BEGIN TO REALIZE, I
[1:06:57] realized that there WAS A SEED DOWN
[1:06:58] INSIDE OF ME THAT HAD TO RESPOND OVER
[1:07:00] TOP OF MY FLESHLY FEELINGS.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; I never felt like I could ever preach
[1:07:04] again. BUT I JUST SAY IT STARTED SAYING
[1:07:07] TWO WORDS.
[1:07:09] Boo devil.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Sister Connie was driving me home from
[1:07:19] the hospital and all THE WAY UP AFTON
[1:07:22] Mountain I was saying boovil.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; OH GOD.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH.
[1:07:39] I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO PREACH THIS
[1:07:40] MEETING,
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; BUT I TELL YOU TONIGHT, THERE'S A
[1:07:44] SUPERNATURAL GOSPEL, A SUPERNATURAL
[1:07:47] POWER THAT IS IN THIS TENT AND ON THESE
[1:07:50] HALLOWED GROUNDS THAT WANTS TO MEET YOU
[1:07:53] TONIGHT.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say a couple of more
[1:08:04] words and I'll leave you with this this
[1:08:05] evening. I know many of you traveled
[1:08:08] distances. You've just settled into the
[1:08:10] camp this evening.
[1:08:17] You left your home.
[1:08:20] This meeting you've been praying for for
[1:08:22] months.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Many of you labored
[1:08:30] for this camp.
[1:08:33] You've taught. You've become exhausted.
[1:08:36] maybe even weary and welloing.
[1:08:41] You walk into this meeting and the enemy
[1:08:44] that has been battling you and war with
[1:08:46] you would like to distract you again
[1:08:54] and like I'd like to tell you that this
[1:08:56] is just another camp. I'm here to tell
[1:08:58] you
[1:09:00] if God brought me from the throws of
[1:09:02] death
[1:09:07] God had this camp bought.
[1:09:11] God had all of this work done just to
[1:09:13] gather you here.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; This is not just another meeting.
[1:09:36] Nobody knows you like you know you.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Parents don't know you.
[1:09:45] Friends sometimes don't really know you.
[1:09:51] WE HEAR STORIES MAN MURDERS A BUNCH OF
[1:09:53] PEOPLE AND people that live right with
[1:09:54] him says I didn't know him like that.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; No way could have been a murderer.
[1:10:01] No way could have did all OF THAT. I
[1:10:02] KNOW HIM. THEY NEVER THEY'D never touch
[1:10:04] a flea.
[1:10:06] They didn't know them.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S SAD TO SAY MANY TIMES THAT
[1:10:13] PEOPLE SIT RIGHT IN THE pews
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; and you really don't know them
[1:10:19] cuz they WRESTLE
[1:10:22] WITH THAT FIRST BOOK.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; BUT I'LL TELL YOU, ONCE YOU MEET THE
[1:10:28] PILLAR OF FIRE,
[1:10:30] AND THE CLEANSING BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; AND YOU MEET A SUPERNATURAL GOD AND HE
[1:10:37] HAS CAME TO MEET you here tonight.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Cast all your cares."
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't want to be honest. We
[1:10:53] want to be an actor impersonator. We
[1:10:55] want to be we want to be something that
[1:10:56] we're really not.
[1:10:59] can't come to God like that.
[1:11:02] You be honest with God. God, I have got
[1:11:06] some real problems.
[1:11:11] Is this okay?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; This is what God laid on my heart. I
[1:11:15] just
[1:11:20] I have some real problems.
[1:11:23] That man was a good man, my dad. But I
[1:11:26] had some real problems. But I became
[1:11:29] honest and I SAID, "GOD, I RON HAS GOT
[1:11:32] SOME REAL PROBLEMS.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?"
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; And until Ron
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; could make the decision,
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Ron, YOU'VE GOT TO DIE.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T LIVE THIS WAY NO MORE.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T LIVE A DOUBLE STANDARD.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T LIVE ON THE FENCE. YOU CAN'T
[1:11:58] HAVE BOTH WORLDS.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T SATISFY BOTH PLACES.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T QUIT RUNNING FROM YOURSELF.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; THAT DAY, OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; THAT DAY, I MET GOD.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; GOD CAME TO ME.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; SURE, I HAD ALL THE BOOKS AND I LISTENED
[1:12:20] TO THE TAPES AND I'D HEARD PREACHING,
[1:12:23] BUT I NEEDED GOD HIMSELF.
[1:12:28] MORE THAN A HANDSHAKE, MORE THAN A PAT
[1:12:30] ON THE BACK, MORE THAN JUST ANOTHER
[1:12:33] TAPE, MORE THAN JUST SOME OTHER BOOK.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; I needed more than a motivational
[1:12:39] sermon.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; So, I'm laboring tonight
[1:12:45] cuz I know without an experience, you're
[1:12:47] not going to make it.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Brother You don't have to have emotion.
[1:12:58] Any thought with anything without
[1:12:59] emotion is dead.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we want to help help the
[1:13:08] birth to come play. But that eagle, he
[1:13:12] has to peck on that egg.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; And if mama helps him, he'll die.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And he has to peck. And all the strength
[1:13:24] that it takes him to peck his way
[1:13:26] through will give him strength to live.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; And the strength that you HAVE TO
[1:13:32] OVERCOME AND STEP OUT OF YOUR SEAT AND
[1:13:35] GO TO AN ALTAR AND SAY, "LORD, I'M GOING
[1:13:38] FOR ME AND NOT THE PREACHER, NOT BROTHER
[1:13:41] ED.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; I CAME TO THIS CAMP UNDER EXPECTATION."
[1:13:48] IF IF YOU CAME UNDER EXPECTATION, YOU
[1:13:50] GET WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING.
[1:13:54] IF YOU CAME TO GO HOME A DIFFERENT
[1:13:56] PERSON, YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T TAKE GOD 20 YEARS.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; GOD COULD COME IN FIVE MINUTES AND
[1:14:11] CHANGE your life forever.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT MY
[1:14:16] WEAKNESS. GIVE YOUR WEAKNESS TO GOD AND
[1:14:19] GOD WILL GIVE YOU THE STRENGTH WHEN YOUR
[1:14:21] WEAKNESS COMES BACK. HE WILL OVERCOME
[1:14:23] THAT WEAKNESS FOR YOU.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet this evening.
[1:14:39] Bow our heads.
[1:14:43] Musicians would come please.
[1:15:10] Lord Jesus,
[1:15:17] in my weakness
[1:15:19] of my own humanity,
[1:15:23] I realize the fraily my own being.
[1:15:29] I realized as I was studying in the
[1:15:32] coming weeks what you had laid on my
[1:15:34] heart for this first night, I realized
[1:15:36] the difficulty it would be to speak
[1:15:42] because Satan wants to disguise his
[1:15:44] weaknesses
[1:15:48] and if he continues can continue the
[1:15:50] weakness
[1:15:52] can constantly bombard the
[1:16:00] He can constantly pull
[1:16:04] away from the fellowship of God.
[1:16:09] But when we realize what we've been
[1:16:11] called to do from this age,
[1:16:15] and it's been more than just to come to
[1:16:17] church,
[1:16:21] more than just occupy a few people,
[1:16:28] but we've got some real overcoming to
[1:16:30] do.
[1:16:34] I can't overcome for them.
[1:16:39] Brother Ed can't overcome for them.
[1:16:41] Brother Tom can't overcome for them.
[1:16:44] Their best friends can't overcome for
[1:16:47] somewhere or another. We have to be
[1:16:48] honest and say, "God, I need you to help
[1:16:51] me.
[1:16:54] I need you to change my name.
[1:16:57] I need you to change my nature.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; I need you to change my being, God.
[1:17:05] Change my desires.
[1:17:08] Change my heart away.
[1:17:14] I feel the deep calling to the deep.
[1:17:17] I'm just tired of running.
[1:17:19] I'm tired of playing church.
[1:17:26] God, you did all of this to call us to
[1:17:28] this night.
[1:17:31] I come to my place.
[1:17:34] The workers have worked so diligently
[1:17:37] hard to build this camp
[1:17:40] that we could come to this place
[1:17:43] and now you have come to your place. Oh
[1:17:45] God,
[1:17:46] you're wooing on our hearts.
[1:17:50] Lord, as I stand as I come to this this
[1:17:53] time of the service now,
[1:17:58] I realize this is eternal times.
[1:18:02] Where will we go from here?
[1:18:05] Five years from now, will we be to the
[1:18:07] pillar of a church
[1:18:12] or brother Ram says or in a power room?
[1:18:15] The choice that we make tonight
[1:18:18] might be where we'll spend eternity.
[1:18:24] The games that we're playing, are they
[1:18:25] fooling us? Are we fooling others?
[1:18:31] God, let us take the actor's mask off
[1:18:33] tonight. Lord,
[1:18:36] let us be honest with you, Father.
[1:18:42] Create in me a clean heart, oh God.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Renew a right spirit within me.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; RESTORE UNTO ME THE JOY OF MY SALVATION.
[1:18:52] OH GOD,
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; PURGE ME WITH HIP, OH GOD.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; BREAK DOWN EVERY BARRIER.
[1:19:01] HALLELUJAH. EVERY STRONGHOLD OF THE
[1:19:03] ENEMY, oh God.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; I PRAY THAT YOU'D BREAK EVERY SPIRIT OF
[1:19:08] HELL.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus,
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; break every shackle, every chain,
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; EVERY EVERY BALL THAT WOULD SATAN WOULD
[1:19:18] HOLD US BONDAGE TO.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; EVERY WEAKNESS TONIGHT, I PRAY MAY WE BE
[1:19:23] SET FREE. AND WHOM THE SON HAS SET FREE,
[1:19:26] THEY ARE FREE INDEED.
[1:19:29] I PROCLAIM A LIBERTY TONIGHT
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Why don't you defy EVERY BIT OF PRIDE,
[1:19:45] EVERY bit of
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; I want you to JUST COME TONIGHT WHILE
[1:19:48] HE'S BROODING OVER your soul. WANT YOU
[1:19:50] TO STEP OUT FROM YOUR SEAT tonight and
[1:19:52] SAY, "TONIGHT, I'M NOT WAITING TILL
[1:19:54] TOMORROW. I'M NOT WAITING till next
[1:19:55] week.
[1:20:00] I want to PECK THROUGH THE SHELL.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO PECK THROUGH THE BARRIER
[1:20:04] TONIGHT.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; I bring my WEAKNESS TO THIS ALTAR AND
[1:20:07] I'M HONEST WITH GOD AND I SAY, "GO GOD,
[1:20:11] COME AND SET ME FREE TONIGHT.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Created me. CREATED ME." I FEEL THE
[1:20:17] SPIRIT OF THE LORD just now.
[1:20:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:50] I stepped to the altar just a few
[1:20:52] moments ago and I stood behind this pull
[1:20:54] pit. Young brother Douly, I believe his
[1:20:56] name is Sam.
[1:20:59] I watched him step through the back of
[1:21:00] the tent and I heard the voice of God in
[1:21:02] my heart say he'll stand at this altar
[1:21:04] tonight. And here he stands.
[1:21:30] Let him do the work.
[1:21:34] Let him do the work.
[1:21:36] Just surrender all to him right now.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Now it's your turn.
[1:21:46] Lord, I need help just now.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Just now. He's here. You don't have to
[1:21:51] beg him to come. He's here.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have to pray him down. He's
[1:21:55] right there with you just now. Take your
[1:21:58] lips just now.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; The most supernatural part of you, take
[1:22:03] your vocal cords and speak to him just
[1:22:06] now and say, "Lord, I've come. I stand
[1:22:08] here tonight. I'm under expectation.
[1:22:14] Meet me, oh God. Break down every
[1:22:16] obstacle.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE VICTORY THAT OVERCOMETH THE
[1:22:29] DEVIL.
[1:22:30] This is the victory.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan Are you standing back
[1:22:43] there?
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Don't let him lie to you. DON'T BELIEVE
[1:22:47] HIS LIE ANOTHER NIGHT.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you shouldn't pull. I'M NOT
[1:23:01] I'M PUSHING. I USED TO PUSH DRUGS, BUT I
[1:23:03] PUSH GOD NOW.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:12] He's the one doing the brooding. He's in
[1:23:13] control of this service.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; MOMS AND DADS, YOU'VE GROWN COLD.
[1:23:21] Tonight can be your night, too.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU FELT YOURSELF SLIP AWAY.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; You felt the cooling off.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; You felt the barrier of it come between
[1:23:35] you and your God.
[1:23:42] If it's just an INTELLECTUAL EXPERIENCE,
[1:23:44] JUST ANOTHER QUOTE, I'LL TELL YOU IT'S A
[1:23:46] supernatural God.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; And that God knows where you're at.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:23:59] Hallelujah.
[1:24:00] Let's take off the actor's mask.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Let's take off the phony face.
[1:24:12] Maybe somebody in the internet just
[1:24:16] fall on your knees before God.
[1:24:21] Dear Jesus,
[1:24:24] we welcome you to this spot.
[1:24:27] My heart is open.
[1:24:30] I need you, oh God.
[1:24:35] I need you, oh God. God, you see all the
[1:24:37] circumstances that are around us.
[1:24:41] You see the enemy.
[1:24:44] God, you can help us to overcome every
[1:24:47] weakness, every besetting sin.
[1:24:52] Oh God, I ask you to come and meet our
[1:24:54] needs tonight.
[1:24:57] I feel such a strong tug of you tonight,
[1:24:59] Father.
[1:25:04] Oh, I surrender.
[1:25:38] Hallelujah.
[1:26:11] truth.
[1:26:26] to
[1:26:35] surrender.
[1:26:37] I surrender all
[1:26:44] father.
[1:26:48] I surrender all
[1:26:58] to thee. My
[1:27:02] blessed
[1:27:05] Savior.
[1:27:08] I
[1:27:11] surrender.
[1:27:20] To Jesus
[1:27:24] I
[1:27:26] surrender.
[1:27:31] Oh to him.
[1:27:34] Lord I freely
[1:27:38] gave
[1:27:40] and I
[1:27:43] I will ever
[1:27:46] love
[1:27:49] and trust him and in
[1:27:54] his presence
[1:27:58] I will daily.
[1:28:02] I surrender Lord.
[1:28:06] What I surrender
[1:28:16] my surren
[1:28:29] to thee
[1:28:31] my
[1:28:32] blessed
[1:28:38] I
[1:28:40] surrender.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:56] Hallelujah.
[1:29:04] God's asking one thing of you and that
[1:29:05] is this.
[1:29:07] Call
[1:29:09] upon the name of the Lord.
[1:29:13] Call. You're here. You're praying for
[1:29:16] something.
[1:29:17] It's one thing to sing. It's one thing
[1:29:19] to rejoice. One thing to clap your
[1:29:21] hands. But the scripture says, "Call."
[1:29:25] Just call upon the name of the Lord.
[1:29:29] Hallelujah. Don't whisper. Call upon
[1:29:31] him.
[1:29:35] As parents and as interested and
[1:29:37] concerned believers, let us also pray.
[1:29:40] Let us also call. Meet these needy ones.
[1:29:44] Meet these honest ones. Meet these Oh
[1:29:46] God. If I were you, I would call upon
[1:29:51] his name.
